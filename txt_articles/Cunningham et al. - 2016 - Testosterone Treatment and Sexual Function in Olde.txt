Context: The Testosterone Trials are a coordinated set of seven trials to determine the efficacy of
T in symptomatic men �65 years old with unequivocally low T levels. Initial results of the Sexual
Function Trial showed that T improved sexual activity, sexual desire, and erectile function.
Objective: To assess the responsiveness of specific sexual activities to T treatment; to relate hor-
mone changes to changes in sexual function; and to determine predictive baseline characteristics
and T threshold for sexual outcomes.
Design: A placebo-controlled trial.
Setting: Twelve academic medical centers in the United States.
Participants: A total of 470 men �65 years of age with low libido, average T �275 ng/dL, and a
partner willing to have sexual intercourse at least twice a month.
Methods: Men were assigned to take T gel or placebo for 1 year. Sexual function was assessed by
three questionnaires every 3 months: the Psychosexual Daily Questionnaire, the Derogatis Inter-
view for Sexual Function, and the International Index of Erectile Function.
Results: Compared with placebo, T administration significantly improved 10 of 12 measures of
sexual activity. Incremental increases in total and free T and estradiol levels were associated with
improvementsinsexualactivityanddesire,butnoterectilefunction.NothresholdTlevelwasobserved
for any outcome, and none of the 27 baseline characteristics predicted responsiveness to T.
Conclusions: In older men with low libido and low T levels, improvements in sexual desire and
activity in response to T treatment were related to the magnitude of increases in T and estradiol
levels, but there was no clear evidence of a threshold effect. (J Clin Endocrinol Metab 101:
3096–3104, 2016)
T
estosterone treatment improves sexual function in
younger men who have T deficiency due to disorders
of the testes, the pituitary, or the hypothalamus (1, 2) or
to administration of a GnRH agonist (3, 4) or antagonist
(5). However, the efficacy of T treatment in improving
sexual function in older men with age-related decline of T
levels remains unclear (6, 7). Meta-analyses have found
that T treatment improves libido and to a lesser degree
erectile function in predominantly middle-aged men with
low total T levels (8, 9). These analyses were based upon
a limited number of trials, several of which included fewer
than 60 men and none of which included more than 140
men per treatment arm. T treatment has improved sexual
function in some trials, but not in others (6, 10–12). Most

 placebo-controlled trials of T treatment in older men have
lacked adequate statistical power due to small sample size,
and few trials have included men with sexual symptoms.
In fact, some trials selected men for inclusion based on no
specific symptoms or nonsexual symptoms such as frailty
(11). In other trials, men with low normal T levels were
included, and sexual function was assessed in some trials
using nonvalidated questionnaires (6). More recently, T
treatment was reported to improve sexual desire, erectile
function, and sexual activity in a randomized, placebo-
controlled 12-week trial that included 715 men with a
mean age of 55.3 � 11.0 years, low sex drive or de-
creased energy, and total T levels on two occasions
�300 ng/dL (13).
Studies of the relationship between T levels and sexual
function in older men have produced conflicting results
(6, 14, 15). Sexual function is known to decline with ad-
vancing age (16), as do total and free T levels (17, 18). In
the European Male Aging Study, total and free T levels,
but not estradiol or dihydrotestosterone, were associated
with sexual function in middle-aged and older men (19).
The Testosterone Trials (TTrials) are a coordinated set
of seven double-blind, placebo-controlled trials to assess
the efficacy of T treatment of symptomatic older men with
low T (20). One of the trials, the Sexual Function Trial,
was designed to avoid the deficiencies of prior studies of
sexual function described above. The primary results from
this trial demonstrated that raising T levels in men �65
years of age with reduced sexual desire and low total T
levels improved sexual activity, sexual desire, and erectile
function (21).
The objectives of the current analyses were: to deter-
mine whether the effects were uniform across the 12 mea-
suresofsexualactivity,assessedbythePsychosexualDaily
Questionnaire (PDQ); to identify baseline participant
characteristics that predicted responsiveness to T treat-
ment; and to evaluate the extent to which the magnitude
ofimprovementsinsexualactivity,sexualdesire,anderec-
tile function was related to the magnitude of increases in
sex hormone levels. We also evaluated whether there was
evidence to support potential threshold effects, ie, of on-
treatment T levels that needed to be exceeded to observe
improvements.
Subjects and Methods
Study design
The participants in the TTrials were assigned to receive trans-
dermal T or placebo gel for 1 year. Changes in sexual function
were assessed at baseline and 3, 6, 9, and 12 months.
Participant allocation
We allocated participants to either placebo or T arms using
minimization, with participants assigned to the optimally bal-
ancing treatment with 80% probability (22, 23). Balancing vari-
ables included participation status for each of the three main
trials, trial site, screening T concentration under or over 200
ng/dL, age under or over 75, and use of antidepressants and
phosphodiesterase type 5 (PDE5) inhibitors.
Intervention
The T preparation was AndroGel 1% in a pump bottle (sup-
plied by AbbVie). The initial dose was 5 g daily. Placebo gel
identical to AndroGel but without the active ingredient also was
supplied by AbbVie.
Serum T concentrations were measured at months 1, 2, 3, 6,
and 9 in a central laboratory (Quest Clinical Trials), and the dose
of T gel was adjusted after each measurement to attempt to keep
the concentration within the normal range for young men. The
target range was initially 400–800 ng/dL, but it was changed to
500–800 ng/dL after early trial data showed that the median T
concentration in the men assigned to the T arm was 400–500
ng/dL, below the middle of the target range. Compliance was
assessed by weighing used and unused pump bottles.
Blinding
The participants, the study staff at the trial sites, and the
investigators were blinded to treatment allocation. Only the
Data Coordinating Center and the pharmacist were aware of
the treatment allocation. To maintain blinding, when the dose
was adjusted in a participant taking T, the dose was changed
simultaneously in a participant taking placebo.

 Participants
Participants were recruited principally by mass mailings, fol-
lowed by telephone and in-clinic screenings (24). Inclusion cri-
teria for TTrials included age �65 years, two early morning
fasting total T values with an initial total T �275 ng/dL, a second
�300 ng/dL, and an average �275 ng/dL. To qualify for the
Sexual Function Trial, men had to report low libido, score �20
on the Derogatis Interview for Sexual Function-Sexual Desire
Domain (DISF-SDD) (25), and have a heterosexual partner will-
ing to have sexual intercourse at least twice a month (20). Men
who qualified for the Sexual Function Trial could participate in
morethanonetrial.TheprimaryoutcomemeasurefortheSexual
Function Trial also was collected in all men who qualified for the
TTrials.
The protocol and consent forms were approved by the insti-
tutional review boards of the University of Pennsylvania and all
trial sites. All participants provided written, informed consent. A
data and safety monitoring board monitored unblinded safety
data every 3 months and reviewed overall trial progress every 6
months.
Hormone measurements
At the end of the trial, the serum concentrations of T, free T,
estradiol, and SHBG collected at baseline and 3, 6, 9, and 12
months were measured on sera frozen at �80°C in the Brigham
Research Assay Core Laboratory, Boston, Massachusetts. All
samples from each participant were measured in the same assay
run. Total T (18) and estradiol levels were measured by liquid
chromatography and tandem mass spectrometry, and free T was
assayed by equilibrium dialysis (26). The lower limit for detec-
tion of T is 1 ng/dL, and the interassay coefficient of variation
was �7%. The lower limit for quantitation of estradiol is 1
pg/mL, and the interassay coefficients of variation were 10.1,
8.5, and 6.3%, respectively, in quality control daily pools with
estradiol concentrations of 8, 57.1, and 157.0 pg/mL, respec-
tively. SHBG was assayed by a two-site immunochemilumines-
cence assay (Beckman-Coulter, Inc) whose lower limit of quan-
titation was 0.3 nmol/L.
Outcomes
The primary outcome was a change in sexual activities, mea-
suredovera7-dayperiodusingquestion4ofthePDQ(PDQ-Q4)
(27), which includes 12 specific questions about sexual interests
and activities. The PDQ was administered by interactive voice
response to preserve privacy (28). Secondary outcomes included
measures of sexual desire and erectile and orgasmic function.
Sexual desire was assessed at baseline and 3, 6, 9, and 12 months
with the DISF-SDD. Erectile function was evaluated by the In-
ternational Index of Erectile Function (IIEF)-Erectile Function
Domain (EFD), and orgasmic function was evaluated by the
IIEF-Orgasmic Function Domain (IIEF-OFD) (29). A score of
�20 on the DISF-SDD is indicative of reduced sexual desire (ie,
low libido), and a score of �22 on the IIEF-EFD is indicative of
erectile dysfunction. The patient global impression of change in
sexual desire also was assessed using a standardized question.
Statistical analysis
Although longitudinal analyses utilizing data from all post-
baseline visits were planned, the sample size was conservatively
based on comparisons between baseline and 12 months and ac-
counted for potentially 5% of subjects not providing any post-
baseline data. The enrollment target of 275 for the Sexual Func-
tion Trial was calculated to achieve 90% power to detect a 0.75
U change in the PDQ-Q4 with a two-sided type 1 error rate of
0.05 (20, 30). This enrollment target was reached before com-
pleting enrollment in the other trials; additional men were per-
mitted to enroll if they were also enrolling in other trials that
remained open.
All participants were included in the efficacy analyses in their
assigned arm according to the intention-to-treat principle. Treat-
ment arm comparisons were performed using random effects
models that included the visit month as a categorical variable and
a single main effect for treatment. For continuous outcomes, the
treatment effect from the linear model is the difference in average
response by treatment arm across all four visits. For binary out-
comes, the treatment effect from the logistic model is the log odds
ratio of a positive vs negative outcome for T vs placebo partic-
ipants, averaged over all visits.
The effect of baseline characteristics on the responsiveness of
sexual outcomes to T treatment was assessed by tests of inter-
action of the treatment arm with 27 characteristics (see legend in
Table 1) thought to potentially influence the effect of T on sexual
function outcomes. We adjusted for multiple comparisons by
controlling the false discovery rate (31).
We also sought to evaluate the relation of the magnitude of
changes in hormone levels above baseline with the changes in
measures of sexual activity, desire, and erectile function in men
assigned to the T group. All analyses were performed with ran-
dom effects models for longitudinal data to accommodate mul-
tiple measures per participant and included balancing variables
and the baseline response for each outcome as fixed effects. Ran-
dom intercepts were included for participants. In these models,
effects denote the average change in the outcome associated with
a specified change in the hormone. Increments of 100 ng/mL, 20
pg/mL, and 5 pg/mL were considered for total T, free T, and
estradiol, respectively, in separate models.
We calculated cardiovascular risk scores using the 2013
American College of Cardiology/American Heart Association
risk calculator, which utilizes the risk factors of age, sex, race,
total cholesterol, high-density lipoprotein cholesterol, systolic
and diastolic blood pressure, treatment for hypertension, diabe-
tes, and current smoker (32).
Finally, we investigated the possibility of hormonal thresh-
olds for affecting clinical outcomes. We correlated hormone lev-
els with scores on the PDQ-Q4, DISF-SDD, and IIEF-EFD using
locally weighted linear regression in men assigned to receive T
(33). This nonparametric regression technique allows the data to
determine the shape of the association between hormones and
sexual function outcomes and assess whether there exists a level
of hormones such that beyond that level, sexual outcomes do not
further increase on average.
We ran the analyses using SAS/STAT, version 9.4 (SAS In-
stitute, Inc).

 ment groups were generally well balanced on baseline
characteristics (Table 1); there were more Hispanics in the
T group and more men married and living with a partner
in the placebo group (P � .02 for both comparisons); two
such imbalances among 40 baseline characteristics are ex-
pected by chance. Over 60% of the men were obese. Ap-
proximately one-third had diabetes, and �70% had hy-
pertension.Fewerthan11%ofthemenwereusingaPDE5

Questionnaire-9, were low (mean � SD, 4.8 � 3.7 and
5.0 � 4.0 for the placebo and T groups, respectively).
Hormone levels
T treatment increased serum total and free T and es-
tradiollevelsintothemid-normalrangeforyoung,healthy
men (ages 19–40 years) (Figure 1). Serum total and free T
and estradiol levels did not change significantly in the pla-
cebo group. SHBG levels were not changed significantly in
either group.
Effect of the intervention on measures of sexual
activity
Figure 2A illustrates the effect of T treatment on each
of the 12 measures of sexual activity in PDQ-Q4. Signif-
icant treatment effects were observed for all but two of the
12activities(P�.001–.026),with“flirtingbyothers”and
“day spontaneous erections” being the only activities with
a nonsignificant treatment effect. The 12 activities occur
with varying frequency, with some occurring only 5% of
days and others occurring as frequently as 40% of days
(Figure 2B).

 teristics influenced the effects of T treatment on primary
and secondary endpoints in men in the Sexual Function
Trial. Of the 27 baseline characteristics tested, only alco-
hol use appeared to influence the effect of T on sexual
activity and sexual desire; more drinks per week were as-
sociated with a greater effect of T on sexual desire and
activity scores. History of a stroke and higher scores on the
International Prostate Symptom Score appeared to reduce
the effect of T on sexual desire. Higher scores on the Pos-
itive and Negative Affect Scales (PANAS) and a history of
coronary artery disease were associated with a lesser effect
of T on erectile function. These interactions were all
nominally significant at the 0.05 level, but none were sig-
nificant after adjusting for multiple comparisons (31).
Cardiovascular risk scores showed no association with
responsiveness to T treatment (data not shown).
Relation of the changes in hormone levels with
changes in sexual activity, desire, and erectile
function
The magnitude of changes in total and free T and es-
tradiol levels was significantly associated with the mag-
nitude of improvements in sexual activity and sexual de-
sire, but not erectile function (Table 2). Although these
increments are small, the changes in the PDQ-Q4 and the
DISF-SDD were highly significant. Increments in estradiol
levels, but not in total or free T, were associated with
greater improvement in orgasmic function. The IIEF-OFD
score appears more strongly related to changes in estradiol
levels than to changes in other hormones. We also com-
pared changes in the DISF-SDD, PDQ-Q4, and IIEF-EFD
for men with and without diabetes. In men assigned to T,
there were no significant differences between persons with
diabetes and nondiabetics for PDQ-Q4, DISF-SDD, or
IIEF-EFD. In the placebo arm, a change in IIEF-EFD was
on average 1.4 points higher in nondiabetic men than di-
abetic men (P � .04), but this difference is not expected to
beclinicallyrelevant.Therewerenosignificantdifferences
in responses to the PDQ-Q4 or DISF-SDD in men treated
with placebo. Our threshold analyses did not reveal any
thresholds of sex steroid values with any of the sexual
function outcomes (data not shown).
Discussion
To date, the Sexual Function Trial of the TTrials is the
largest placebo-controlled trial of the efficacy of T on sex-
ual function in older men with low libido and unequivo-
cally low T levels. T administration was associated with
consistent improvements in 10 of the 12 measures of sex-
ual interests and activities, as assessed by PDQ-Q4. These
include frequency of intercourse, masturbation, and noc-
turnal erections. Only “flirting by others” and “day spon-
taneous erections” were not changed by T treatment.
Sexual desire and activity increased with increases in cir-

baseline and during treatment.

 culating total T, free T, and estradiol levels. We were not
able to demonstrate T threshold levels for the sexual func-
tion outcomes.
These data are consistent with those from a recently
reported trial of men with low sexual desire (85% of men)
or decreased energy and low T levels, which reported sig-
nificantly greater improvements in self-reported sex drive,
erectile function, and sexual activity with T administra-
tion than with placebo; unlike the TTrials, this trial in-
cluded much younger men who had a mean age of 55.3
years (13). Similar instruments were used in both trials to
assess erectile function and sexual activity, and outcomes
were similar. In both trials, T treatment improved sexual
desire, erectile function, and sexual activity at 3 months,
and in our trial it was sustained for
the 12 months of treatment (21). The
Testosterone Effects on Atheroscle-
rosis in Aging Men Trial did not find
a significant difference in the change
in erectile function, sexual desire, or
partner intimacy in men with a mean
age of 66.9 � 5.0 years and low nor-
mal T levels, who were not selected
on the basis of sexual symptoms
(12). Taken together, these data sug-
gest that T therapy improves sexual
desire, erectile function, and overall
sexual activity in younger and older
menwithlowlibidoandlowTlevels.
The consistency of the effects of T
on multiple domains of sexual func-
tion—sexual desire, erectile function,
andoverallsexualactivity—assessedus-
ing a number of self-reported instru-
ments, is noteworthy. Additionally,
the consistent improvements ob-
served with T treatment on 10 of 12
measures of sexual activity is impor-
tant and is supportive of the benefi-
cial effects of T on sexual function in
older men with low T levels.
The clinical significance of these
findings is supported by the treat-
ment effects and effect sizes on sex-
ual outcomes and the change in daily
sexual activities. We previously re-
ported
that
sexual
activity,
the
primaryoutcomeoftheSexualFunc-
tion Trial as measured by summa-
tion of 12 components of PDQ-Q4,
showed a treatment effect of 0.58
(95% CI 0.38, 0.78; P � .001) and
an effect size of 0.45 (95% CI 0.30,
0.60) (21). T treatment had a treatment effect of 2.93
(95% CI 2.13, 3.74; P � .001) and an effect size of 0.44
(95% CI 0.32, 0.56) on sexual desire and a treatment
effect of 2.64 (95% CI 1.68, 3.61; P � .001) and an effect
size of 0.32 (95% CI 0.20,0.44) on erectile function (21).
Effect sizes of 0.5 are generally considered to indicate a
moderate effect, whereas an effect of 0.2 is considered
small. Although significant, the effect on erectile function
is more modest than the 5.7 point increase in EFD scores
observed when men 60 and older were treated with silde-
nafil (34). The global impression of change in sexual desire
also was significantly improved (P � .001). Figure 2B doc-
uments that men in the T group had increases in 10 of 12
measurements of daily sexual activities.

 We determined whether any of several factors that pre-
viously have been associated with sexual dysfunction,
such as age, body mass index (BMI), diabetes, and use of
alcohol and PDE5 inhibitors, affected responsiveness to T
replacement. We found, however, that no individual in-
teraction was significant when we adjusted for multiple
comparisons. Because erectile function is dependent upon
the integrity of vascular inflow, we also evaluated a car-
diovascular risk score but found that this score also was
not associated with responsiveness to T treatment. We
also found that changes in the PDQ-Q4 and DISF-SDD
from baseline of participants with diabetes were similar to
those of men who did not have diabetes in both treatment
arms. In the placebo arm, nondiabetic men had a greater
change in IIEF-EFD scores than diabetic men, but this was
not observed among men in the T arm. Importantly, we
note that these men had low T levels as well as symptoms
of sexual dysfunction.
The improvements in sexual desire and sexual activity
in men assigned to T were related to the magnitude of
changes in total and free T and estradiol levels, although
the relationships were modest in magnitude. Median (in-
terquartile range) of total T, free T, and estradiol at base-
line were 227 (84), 62.3 (28.6), and 19.6 (8), respectively,
and increased to 483 (318), 144.9 (120.5), and 30.5 (20.7)
among men in the T arm during the 1-year treatment pe-
riod. These changes in hormone levels were not directly
related to dose, but rather serum levels of hormone; vary-
ing dose levels were required to achieve the desired target
range of serum T concentration.
Previous T treatment trials in older men have evaluated
T dose response relationships in men whose T levels were
spontaneously low (6) or whose T levels were reduced
withaGnRHagonist(35).Grayetal(35)notedthatlibido
increased as the dose increased for men who were sexually
active before the trial. These observations are consistent
with our findings. Although we observed significant im-
provementsinsexualactivity,desire,anderectilefunction,
only the changes in sexual desire and sexual activity were
related to increments in T levels.
Some authors have reported that the serum T concen-
tration needs to reach a threshold level near the lower limit
of normal for adequate sexual function. This impression is
supported by clinical experience (36, 37) and some pop-
ulation-based correlations (19). Investigators also have
reported threshold effects when they evaluated libido and
erectile function in men who were treated with a GnRH
agonist to suppress the hypothalamic-pituitary-testicular
axis, and also with graded doses of T (4, 35). Investigators
reported a T threshold in the 200- to 300-ng/dL range
when they correlated erections and penile rigidity in a
sleep laboratory with T levels (38).
We reported previously that in the TTrials population
at baseline, we found no threshold level of T for sexual
desire, erectile function, or sexual activity (26). In the
treatment phase of the TTrials, we evaluated men who
received T to provide a greater range of circulating T con-
centrations, yet we still found no threshold. If a distinct
threshold for total or free T exists, it may be lower than
that in most of our participants. This effect may also be
more difficult to detect in older men with multiple comor-
bidities, such as the TTrials population.
PDE5 inhibitors can improve erectile function in some,
but not all, men with low T levels (39). Evidence that T
treatment can improve responsiveness to a PDE5 inhibitor
is conflicting (39, 40). Less than 11% of the men in our
trial were using a PDE5 inhibitor at the beginning of the
trial, and the number did not change significantly during
the trial. The number of men using a PDE5 inhibitor was
not sufficient to allow us to assess the interaction of PDE5
inhibitors and T levels.

trials evaluating sexual function. In our trial, depression
scores were low. Use of antidepressants was employed as
a balancing factor in the minimization routine. As such,
treatment arms were expected to be balanced for depres-
sion. As a balancing factor, the use of antidepressants was
included in all models, which would account for any pos-
sible residual confounding effects of depression. We pre-
viously reported that T treatment improved mood for par-
ticipants in the Vitality Trial (21).

 The TTrials have many strengths and some limitations.
The TTrials required two low, early morning, fasting total
T levels in men �65 years of age who did not have an
organic cause for hypogonadism. The Sexual Function
Trial also required low libido. We also used state-of-the-
art hormone assays. The trial was powered at 90%, pla-
cebo-controlled, and double-blinded. We monitored total
T levels and made dose adjustments to achieve and main-
tain serum T levels in the target range, while maintaining
blinding. Finally, we used validated instruments to assess
outcomes. Our primary outcome, sexual activity, utilized
the PDQ-Q4, which had been shown to be responsive to
T treatment in previous T trials (27, 30).
The men in the Sexual Function Trial were required to
be in a stable relationship with a partner; however, we did
not assess or control for partner sexual function or other
partner factors, which may have influenced the results. T
treatment increases estradiol levels as well as T levels, but
the study design did not allow us to determine whether
estradiol has an independent effect on sexual function.
In summary, T treatment of older men with low T levels
consistentlyimprovedmosttypesofsexualactivity,sexual
desire, and erectile function in older men with low libido
and low T levels. The improvements in sexual desire, sex-
ual interests, and sexual activities were related to changes
in T, free T, and estradiol levels. We found no clinical
characteristics that predicted responsiveness to T treat-
ment and no T threshold for improving sexual function.
