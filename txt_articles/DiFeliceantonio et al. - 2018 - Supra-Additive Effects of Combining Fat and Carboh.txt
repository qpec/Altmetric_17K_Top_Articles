In Brief
DiFeliceantonio et al. show that foods
containing fat and carbohydrate are more
reinforcing than equicaloric foods
containing primarily fat or carbohydrate.
This effect is independent of liking and is
reflected by supra-additive responses in
the striatum during food valuation. This
may be one mechanism driving
overconsumption of high-
fat/-carbohydrate processed foods.

SUMMARY
Post-ingestive signals conveying information about
the nutritive properties of food are critical for regu-
lating ingestive behavior. Here, using an auction
task concomitant to fMRI scanning, we demonstrate
that participants are willing to pay more for fat + car-
bohydrate compared with equally familiar, liked, and
caloric fat or carbohydrate foods and that this poten-
tiated reward is associated with response in areas
critical for reward valuation, including the dorsal
striatum and mediodorsal thalamus. We also show
that individuals are better able to estimate the energy
density of fat compared with carbohydrate and fat +
carbohydrate foods, an effect associated with func-
tional connectivity between visual (fusiform gyrus)
and valuation (ventromedial prefrontal cortex) areas.
These results provide the first demonstration that
foods high in fat and carbohydrate are, calorie for
calorie, valued more than foods containing only fat
or carbohydrate and that this effect is associated
with greater recruitment of central reward circuits.
INTRODUCTION
Post-ingestive signals conveying information about the nutritive
properties of food are critical for regulating ingestive behavior.
Rats readily titrate the volume of food (i.e., portion size) they
consume to hold daily caloric intake constant, indicating that
rats eat for calories rather than portion (Adolph, 1947). Likewise,
in humans, separate neural circuits respond to energy density
compared with portion size of foods depicted in images (English
et al., 2016).
Post-ingestive signals also act as powerful reinforcers in ro-
dent models (Epstein and Teitelbaum, 1962; Miller and Kessen,
1952). In rodents, flavor-nutrient conditioning studies demon-
strate that intragastric infusion of nutrients, but not saline, pro-
duces strong preferences for the flavor of a simultaneously
consumed non-caloric flavored liquid (Holman, 1969; Sclafani,
2004) and these signals are both necessary and sufficient to
sustain feeding via their effects on dopamine release in the stria-
tum (de Araujo et al., 2008; Ren et al., 2010; Tellez et al., 2013a,
2013c). Accordingly, in humans, the tasteless and odorless
carbohydrate maltodextrin, but not the non-caloric sweetener
sucralose, conditions increased intake of sorbet (Yeomans
et al., 2008), while the magnitude of the blood-oxygen-level-
dependent (BOLD) signal in dopamine target areas to calorie-
predictive flavors depends upon the increase in plasma glucose
levels when the flavors are previously consumed with calories
(de Araujo et al., 2013). Notably, neither sorbet intake nor
BOLD response correlates with self-reported sorbet or flavor
liking. Likewise, willingness to pay for food is associated with
actual, but not estimated, caloric density and is reflected by
BOLD response in the mesolimbic network (Tang et al., 2014).
Collectively, these findings suggest that post-ingestive signals
regulate neural circuits in the dopaminergic meso-striato-pre-
fontal system independently of other food characteristics that
could influence reward, such as liking, sweetness, perceived
energy density, and availability (e.g., portion size). This has
important implications for understanding the human obesity
epidemic because mesolimbic neural response to food cues
correlate with obesity (Bruce et al., 2010; Feldstein Ewing
et al., 2016; Stoeckel et al., 2008; Val-Laillet et al., 2011), genetic
risk for obesity (Farooqi et al., 2007; Holsen et al., 2012; Rapuano
et al., 2017), eating in the absence of hunger (Lawrence et al.,
2012), food choice (Mehta et al., 2012; Schur et al., 2009), future
weight gain (de Araujo et al., 2013; Demos et al., 2012; Geha
et al., 2013; Kroemer et al., 2016), poorer performance on
weight-loss trials (Murdaugh et al., 2012), and overfeeding
(Cornier et al., 2007).
However, very little is understood about the mechanisms
behind the generation of post-ingestive signals (in any species)
and their regulation of mesolimbic circuits. One overlooked but

 potentially important factor is the possibility that separate mech-
anisms evolved for fat and carbohydrate (Ritter and Taylor, 1990;
Tellez et al., 2013a, 2013b). Although vagal afferent signals are
critical for intra-gastrically administered lipids to increase extra-
cellular striatal dopamine and promote appetitive behavior,
dopamine release upon glucose infusion depends upon a yet-
unknown metabolic signal thought to be generated during the
utilization of glucose as a cellular fuel (Ren et al., 2010; Tellez
et al., 2013b). Further, in rodents, vagotomy disrupts the orexi-
genic effects of nutrient deprivation by blocking fatty acid oxida-
tion, but not by blocking glucose utilization (Ritter and Taylor,
1990). There is also evidence for independent gut-brain path-
ways for fat and sugar (i.e., carbohydrate) reward in humans.
People with a genetically derived deficiency in melanocortin-4
receptors (MC4Rs) exhibit increased preference for high-fat
but reduced preference for high-sucrose foods (van der Klaauw
et al., 2016), whereas variants in the hepatokine fibroblast
growth factor 21 (FGF21) gene are associated with increased
preference for sweet, but not fat, foods (Soberg et al., 2017).
The existence of independent sensing pathways for fat and
carbohydrate is especially relevant when considering the human
obesity epidemic. The modern food environment proffers up
nutrients in doses and combinations that do not exist in nature.
This contrasts sharply with our ancestors’ diet composed mostly
of woody plants and raw animal meat (Balter et al., 2012). More-
over, since hunter-gatherer societies eat single dietary compo-
nents at a time (Berbesque et al., 2011), even when nuts and
seeds, which contain some fat, were available, consuming
multiple foods in a single meal would have been a rare occur-
rence. One exception would be fruits containing seeds high in
fat and pulp high in carbohydrate. However, such plants are
rare and are very high in fiber, which would have significantly
reduced the rate of carbohydrate metabolism (Murray et al.,
2001). Opportunities to consume fat and carbohydrate together
certainly increased following the domestication of plants and an-
imals and development of grain and dairy production (�12,000
years ago). However, this is recent in our evolutionary past and
still significantly different than the processed foods of today.
For example, the nutritional content of oats with a half cup of
milk and honey is only 1 g of fat and 27 g of carbohydrates.
Compare this with a donut of similar calories, which contains
11 g of fat and 17 g of carbohydrate.
Since physiology is shaped by natural selection in response to
environmental pressures, it is possible that the simultaneous
activation of fat and carbohydrate signaling pathways produces
a potentiated or perhaps extra-physiologic effect to potentiate
reward and render processed foods high in fat and sugar more
rewarding, calorie for calorie, than foods high in only fat or sugar.
Consistent with this suggestion, rodents tightly regulate total
daily caloric intake and body weight (Adolph, 1947) when given
access to fat alone or carbohydrate alone; however, when given
unrestricted access to fat and carbohydrate they quickly gain
weight (Beilharz et al., 2014, 2016; Johnson and Kenny, 2010),
suggesting that it is the combination of these macronutrients
that disrupts energy balance.
With this in mind, we set out to determine if palatable familiar
foods high in fat and carbohydrate are more rewarding than simi-
larly caloric, familiar, and liked foods high in only fat or only car-
bohydrate. To test this we used the Becker-DeGroot-Marshak
auction (Becker et al., 1964) task, in which participants bid for
snacks depicted in photographs, while BOLD response was
assessed using fMRI. By using familiar snack items, we ensure
that participants have had the opportunity to associate these
foods with their nutritional properties via flavor-nutrient condi-
tioning in the past and, based on this conditioning, the food
images represent energy-predictive conditioned stimuli.
This enabled us to test the hypothesis that pictures associated
with the post-ingestive effects of fat and carbohydrate are more
reinforcing than those associated with the post-ingestive effects
of primarily fat or carbohydrate. As predicted, we found that
participants are willing to pay more for snacks with fat + carbo-
hydrate, compared with fat or carbohydrate alone, and that this
effect was reflected by response in the dorsal striatum (caudate
and putamen) and mediodorsal thalamus. Unexpectedly, we
observed that participants are very accurate at estimating the
energy density of fat, but not carbohydrate or fat + carbohydrate
foods, an effect that is reflected by response in the fusiform
gyrus and its connectivity with ventromedial prefrontal cortex
(vmPFC), anterior cingulate cortex, and cerebellum. These
results are the first to demonstrate that foods high in fat and
carbohydrate are more rewarding, calorie for calorie, than foods
high only in fat or carbohydrate and that energy density estima-
tion accuracy differs depending on macronutrient.
RESULTS
Our first step was to create a set of pictures of small snacks fall-
ing into one of three categories of macronutrient content: those
with most of their calories coming from (1) fat, (2) carbohydrate,
or (3) fat + carbohydrate, but varying equally within category for
liking, familiarity, and caloric content (Table 1). Testing was per-
formed in a pilot study (n = 56) that did not include participants
from the main study (STAR Methods). Examples from each
group are depicted in Figure 1A. Portion sizes were adjusted
across macronutrient groups to equate caloric content across
snacks so that there were examples of low, medium, and high
caloric values in each category with overall mean calories across
categories similar (Table 1). Portion size was not significantly
different across groups and pictures were chosen to have equal
object size, intensity, and complexity, although they differed
slightly in contrast (Table 1). This resulted in 39 stimuli with 13
in each group.
Methods and analyses are described in detail in the STAR
Methods section. In brief, all participants in the main study first
rated these snacks for liking, familiarity, estimated energy den-
sity, and total calories shown. On a subsequent day, they arrived
fasted to the laboratory and were fed a standard breakfast of
426 kcal from orange juice, cheddar cheese, whole-wheat toast,
white toast, strawberry jam, and butter (described in Tang et al.,
2014). They began the fMRI session 3 hr later. Prior to scanning,
participants were given V5 and told they could bid between V0
and V5 against the computer to purchase snacks depicted in
pictures presented during scanning. They were also told that
one item will be selected at random for auction at the end of
scanning. If the participant’s bid was higher than the computer’s
bid, he or she was able purchase the item and receive the
remainder of the V5 in cash. Otherwise, the participant received
the entire V5 but did not get the item. Participants remained in a

 supervised setting following scanning, during which time they
consumed the item, if one had been won. Under these circum-
stances the optimum strategy is to bid what one believes is the
value of the item (Becker et al., 1964).
Behavioral Results
Between-Category Differences in Ratings and Energy
Density
We first compared the snack macronutrient categories to test for
differences in liking and estimated and actual energy density
using one-way ANOVAs. By design, no differences were
observed in caloric content (F(2,36) < 0.001, p = 0.9; Figure 1B),
familiarity (F(2, 36) = 0.08, p = 0.92; Figure 1C), or liking (F(2,36) =
1.94, p = 0.073; Figure 1D). Fat + carbohydrate snacks were
higher in energy density (F(2,36) = 9.99, p = 0.0004; Figure 1E)
and were accurately estimated by participants as being more
calorically dense (F(2,36) = 8.73, p = 0.0008; Figure 1F). Partici-
pants also bid slightly faster for these snacks (F(2, 36) = 4.286,
p = 0.0214; Figure 1G).
Associations between Ratings and Energy Density
We next examined correlations between willingness to pay,
energy density, estimated energy density, and liking using linear
regressions. All regression p values are Bonferroni corrected for
the total number of tests run (32). Replicating prior work by
Tang et al. (2014), willingness to pay was highly associated with
energy density (r2 = 0.225, p < 0.001; Figure 2A) across all snacks.
Importantly, willingness to pay was not correlated with estimated
energy density in the full group (r2 = 0.070, p > 0.9; Figure 2B) or in
any subgroup. Taken together, this indicates that actual energy
density is a better predictor of food reward than estimated energy
density. Interestingly, participants could very accurately estimate
the energy density for fat snacks (r2 = 0.688, p = 0.016; Figure 2C).
In contrast to fat snacks, participants were unable to accurately
estimate energy density of carbohydrate (r 2 = 0.012, p > 0.9)
and fat + carbohydrate snacks (r2 = 0.22, p > 0.9; group 3
estimated energy density F(1,37) = 13.132, p = 0.0008).
Willingness to pay was not related to portion size (r2 = 0.0009,
p > 0.9; Figure S1A). Participants could not estimate the number
of calories shown in each snack portion (r2 = 0.211, p = 0.82; Fig-
ure S1B). Liking ratings were also associated with energy density
overall (r2 = 0.122, p = 0.01; Figure S1D), but this was not signif-
icant in any individual group. Liking was not related to estimated
energy density for the whole group (r2 = 0.0003, p = 0.92; Fig-
ure S1E) or any individual group.
Unlike in prior work, where willingness to pay was unrelated to
ratings of liking (Tang et al., 2014), we observed a strong positive

(r2 = 0.69, p < 0.0001; Figure S1C) and in fat (r2 = 0.89,
p = 0.00003) and fat + carbohydrate (r2 = 0.70, p = 0.011) cate-
gories, but not carbohydrate (r2 = 0.58, p = 0.077). To test if en-
ergy density and liking are independent predictors of willingness
to pay, we performed a mediation analysis by constructing
models with both variables entered as predictors. Significance
improved with both variables entered (p = 0.002 to <0.001), but
each contributed uniquely to the effect, with energy density
remaining a significant predictor when liking was included
(b = 0.207, p = 0.03) and liking remaining a significant predictor
when energy density was included (b = 0.763, p < 0.001), indi-
cating both predictors contribute independently.
Between-Group Differences in Willingness to Pay
Next, we generated a linear mixed effects model with bid as the
outcome variable; subject as a random effect; and macronutrient
group, true energy density, estimated energy density, liking,
estimated portion calories, portion size, and calories shown in
each picture as fixed effects to test our prediction that partici-
pants would pay more for the fat + carbohydrate foods
compared with the fat or carbohydrate foods. As predicted,
participants were willing to pay significantly more for foods

and carbohydrate foods.
Although we controlled for liking in all analyses, fat + carbohy-
drate items were liked slightly, but not significantly, more, and
liking and bid amount were highly correlated. We therefore took
an additional step to verify that effects were not related to liking.
More specifically, we re-ran all analyses after removing the two
least liked items from the carbohydrate and fat categories and
the two most liked items from the fat + carbohydrate category.
In so doing, the fat category became most liked (carbohydrate =
7.655 ± 3.342, fat = 17.12 ± 3.267, fat + carbohydrate = 14.59 ±
2.261), but there were still no significant differences in liking
(F(2,30) = 2.674, p = 0.0854; Figure S2C). Categories were also still
matched for calories shown (F(2,30) = 0.06, p = 0.9417; Figure S2A)
and familiarity (F(2,30) = 1.354, p = 0.273; Figure S2B). Just as pre-
viously, fat + carbohydrate items were rated as more energy
dense (F(2,30) = 8.235, p = 0.0014; fat + carbohydrate > C, t(30) =
1.89, p < 0.05; Figure S2D) and actually were more energy dense
(kcal/g) (F(2,30) = 6.12, p = 0.0055; fat + carbohydrate > C, t(30) =
2.82, p < 0.05; fat + carbohydrate > F, t(30) = 3.12, p < 0.01; Fig-
ure S2E). Reaction time did not differ significantly between
groups in the subset (F(2,30) = 2.71, p = 0.078; Figure S2F). Again,
a linear mixed effects model identical to the one described above
(and including energy density as a covariate) revealed that partic-
ipants were willing to bid more for fat + carbohydrate items overall
(F(2,651) = 8.161, p = 0.0003; fat + carbohydrate > C, F(1,651) =
15.322, p < 0.0001; fat + carbohydrate > F, F(1,651) = 10.9797,
p < 0.0001; Figure S2G). The supra-additive effect was also still
present (F(1,651) = 15.771, p < 0.0001).

To

for
regions
sensitive
to
the
rewarding potency of the foods and to
determine if we could replicate prior
work, we created a general linear model
(GLM) in which bid amount for each trial
was entered as a parametric modulator
controlling for energy density. This analysis produced responses
in the right lingual gyrus ([8 �78 �4], z = 4.9, p < 0.00001;
Figure 3), the anterior cingulate cortex ([�8 44 8], z = 3.66,
p < 0.001; Figure 3), the orbitofrontal cortex ([�24 40 �26],
z = 3.85, p < 0.0005; Figure 3), the frontal pole ([�21, 66, 2],
z = 3.06, p < 0.001; Figure 3), and the anterior insula ([�32,
27, �7], z = 2.6, p < 0.001; Figure 3), largely replicating prior
work (Tang et al., 2014). Without controlling for energy density,
a similar network is observed, including the lingual gyrus
([8 �78 �4], z = 2.7, p < 0.001) and anterior cingulate cortex
([�8 38 8], z = 3.4, p = 0.002 and [6 30 24], z = 3.09, p = 0.002).
Next, to test our hypothesis that response in dopamine target
areas would be greater for fat + carbohydrate compared with fat
or carbohydrate foods during bidding, we created a GLM with
estimated calories, true energy density, liking, and bid amount
for each item in each group. This was done to control for factors
that differed across group to ensure any effects seen were due to
the bid amount alone. A contrast of fat + carbohydrate combina-
tion (FC) > fat + carbohydrate was modeled on the first level to
account for within-subject variance. As predicted, response in
the caudate and putamen was more strongly associated with
bid amount for fat + carbohydrate compared with fat or carbohy-
drate alone (caudate, [14 �4 20], z = 3.82, p < 0.001; Table 2; Fig-
ure 4C; putamen, [�28 �2 �2], z = 3.37, p < 0.001; Figure 4D). A
similar effect was also observed in the thalamus ([�10 �12 18],
z = 3.87, p < 0.001; Figure 4E). No significant effects for the
reverse analysis (fat + carbohydrate > fat + carbohydrate)
were found.
We next tested whether bid amount modulated connectivity
with the striatum differentially as a function of macronutrient
category by performing a psychophysiological interaction (PPI)
analysis with the seed defined as a 5 mm sphere surrounding
the caudate peak ([14 �4 20]). Group difference in bid amount
modulated striatal connectivity were observed with insular cor-
tex bilaterally ([38 �12 6], z = 2.719, p < 0.0001; [�40 �8 �10],
z = 2.615, p < 0.0001; Figure 4F) and with the anterior medial
temporal lobe (hippocampus and amygdala, [26 �2 �26],
z = 2.718, p = 0.00106; Figure 4G), although this cluster was
just above our threshold of p < 0.001. More specifically, striatal

 connectivity with these regions is stronger when bidding for
foods containing fat + carbohydrate compared with when
bidding for food containing only fat or only carbohydrate.
In our behavioral analysis, we found participants were only
able to accurately estimate the energy density of fat snacks,
but not carbohydrate or fat + carbohydrate snacks (Figure 2A).
To further confirm this relationship, we performed regressions
such that beta values were generated for each subject for each
snack type. Here, we controlled for portion size across groups
to ensure it was not driving the effects. We found an overall group
difference (Friedman’s statistic = 9.1, p = 0.0106; Figure 5A)
using a non-parametric test, as beta values were not normally
distributed. Further, participants were better able to estimate
the energy density of fat snacks over carbohydrate snacks
(p = 0.0144) and over fat + carbohydrate snacks (p = 0.0228).
Having confirmed this relationship in the behavioral data, we
sought to isolate the neural circuit reflecting the differences in
the ability to estimate energy density of fat compared with carbo-
hydrate and fat + carbohydrate by regressing brain response
against estimated energy density of fat compared with carbohy-
drate and fat + carbohydrate foods. We found a negative rela-
tionship with estimated energy density in the fusiform cortex
when viewing fat pictures, in contrast to a positive response
when viewing carbohydrate or fat + carbohydrate pictures
([�26 �72 �8], z = 3.25, p < 0.00001; Figure 5B). A similar effect
was observed in extrastriate cortex ([�20 �98 02], z = 3.84,
p < 0.0001). To determine if there was differential connectivity
with these visual sensory regions and areas of the meso-
striato-prefrontal regions when estimating energy density for
fat versus carbohydrate or fat + carbohydrate, we ran a PPI
with the extracted time series from a 5 mm sphere around the
fusiform gyrus peak ([�26 �72 �8]). This showed that estimated
energy density increased fusiform connectivity with the vmPFC
([�10 38 �11], z = 3.02, p < 0.00001; Figure 5C), anterior cingu-
late gyrus ([�10 44 8], z = 4.217; Figure 5C), and cerebellum
([26 �68 �17], z = 4.17; Figure 5D) when estimating the energy
density of fat compared with the energy density of carbohydrate
or fat + carbohydrate. This suggests that accurate estimates of
energy density are associated with greater coupling of activity
between the fusiform gyrus and the vmPFC, cingulate, and
cerebellum.
DISCUSSION
Our study produced two novel findings that are relevant for un-
derstanding food choice. First, we demonstrate for the first
time that foods containing both fat and carbohydrate are more
rewarding, calorie for calorie, than those containing only fat or
only carbohydrate, and we further describe a network of brain
regions (caudate, putamen, and mediodorsal thalamus) underly-
ing this effect. Second, we discovered, unexpectedly, that indi-
viduals are better able to estimate the energy density of fat
compared with carbohydrate and fat + carbohydrate foods,
with accurate estimations of energy density depicted in pictures
of fatty foods associated with increased coupling of visual
sensory areas with the vmPFC and cerebellum. Both findings
support and extend work from animal models indicating that
these two energy sources have distinct pathways for conveying
nutritive value to the CNS to ultimately guide food choice and
highlight the need to further understand the mechanisms driving
the interaction of macronutrients on circuits regulating ingestive
behavior.
Studies in mice show that the ability of ingested nutrients to
produce dopamine release to drive reward depends critically
upon their utilization as a cellular fuel (Tellez et al., 2013b,
2013c). Vagotomy blocks the orexigenic effects of the fatty
acid oxidation blocker mercaptoacetate, but not of the orexi-
genic effects of the glucose utilization blocker 2-deoxy-
D-glucose (Ritter and Taylor, 1990). This suggests that the
gut-brain pathways driving fat and carbohydrate reward differ.
Several observations from the current study support this
contention.
First, our data suggest that the association between reward
and energy density differs for fat and carbohydrate (Figure 2).
For fatty foods, willingness to pay (our measure of reward) is
tightly coupled to energy density and self-reported food liking.
Although both food liking and energy density are associated
with willingness to pay, mediation analyses indicate that these
factors contribute independently to reward value. In contrast,
for carbohydrate-containing foods, willingness to pay is posi-
tively related to self-reported food liking, but not energy density.
Moreover, although individuals are very accurate at estimating
the energy density of fatty foods, they are poor at estimating
the energy density of carbohydrate-containing foods, which
our fMRI data suggest results from differential engagement of
the fusiform gyrus.
The fusiform gyrus is critical for encoding features of the visual
world to enable object and place recognition. Our findings add to
a growing literature suggesting it also contributes to the recogni-
tion and valuation of visual features of foods that convey infor-
mation about energy density. There are numerous references
to fusiform responses to food-related visual cues in the neuroi-
maging literature. Such responses are sensitive to the caloric
value of the depicted food and to the internal state of the individ-
ual (Frank et al., 2010; Killgore and Yurgelun-Todd, 2005; Siep
et al., 2009). Typically, they have been interpreted as part of a
network of regions coding visual attention and/or food cue
saliency. Accordingly, fusiform responses to high-calorie-food
images predict inability to maintain weight loss (following a
similar pattern as midbrain and striatum; Murdaugh et al.,
2012), spontaneous fluctuations in the fusiform gyrus correlate

 with self-reported craving (Chen et al., 2017), and responses to
food cues are greater in obese compared with healthy-weight
youth (Allen et al., 2016; Janowitz et al., 2015) as well as in
healthy weight individuals that carry the obesity predisposing
variant of the FTO gene (Kuhn et al., 2016). Fusiform gyrus
response to food pictures also covaries with degree of parental
dietary restriction on children (Allen et al., 2016), as well as
personal dietary restraint (Zhao et al., 2017), indicating that the
fusiform gyrus is sensitive not only to the energetic properties
and value of food pictures but also to the experience of food de-
cisions where taste and energy density must be considered.
The mechanism by which striatal dopamine influences fusi-
form activity is unclear; however, a striatum to vmPFC to fusiform
circuit is possible. Accordingly, we observe preferential connec-
tivity between the fusiform gyrus and vmPFC when bidding for
fat versus carbohydrate or fat + carbohydrate foods. The vmPFC
plays a critical role in determining food choices based on
comparing taste and health information (Hare et al., 2009) and
the fusiform gyrus to vmPFC neural circuit is thought to integrate
visual features of objects with the generation of value signals to
drive choice (Lim et al., 2013). In a prior study, vmPFC response
correlated with bid amount and actual, but not estimated, energy
density (Tang et al., 2014). The pattern of activations we observe
suggests that the fusiform gyrus-vmPFC circuit plays an impor-
tant role in accurately estimating energy density from visual infor-
mation. More specifically, estimates are accurate when there is a
negative association between energy density and fusiform
response (lower responses for higher energy density; Figure 5)
coupled with increased functional connectivity with the vmPFC
(and cerebellum). Collectively, these data suggest that the fusi-
form has access to the value of the nutritional properties of foods
conveyed by visual information and that interactions between
the fusiform and vmPFC are important in enabling more
accurate estimates of energy density for fat compared with

 carbohydrate-containing foods. One possibility is that the post-
ingestive signal conveying information about the nutritive value
of fat is successfully integrated with visual information about
foods to determine value, whereas the value of carbohydrates
may derive primarily from other features, such as flavor or visual
presentation; however, further research is needed to confirm this
hypothesis. An alternative possibility is that the ubiquity of artifi-
cial sweeteners in modern diets degrades the association
between carbohydrate-containing foods and energy density, re-
sulting in an impaired ability to estimate calories (Davidson and
Swithers, 2004). For example, in the gustatory modality, intensity
ratings of sweetness are positively related to sugar content, but

Figure 4. Effect of Macronutrient on Willingness to Pay and Associated BOLD Activity
Participants are willing to pay more for foods that contain fat and carbohydrate combinations than either macronutrient group alone (A). Foods receiving the
highest and lowest bids are depicted in (B). BOLD signal in caudate nucleus (C), putamen (D), and thalamus (E) was more associated with willingness to pay in the
fat and carbohydrate group than either alone. A PPI analysis showed that caudate connectivity with the bilateral insula was modulated by willingness to pay (F).
The same is true of caudate activity with amygdala and hippocampus, although this bordered on significance at p = 0.00106 (G). Arrows point to the peak voxel in
each cluster. Parameter estimates (PE) are a.u. and are represented as means ± SEM. *p < 0.0001.

 the association is significantly stronger for raw and moderately
processed foods compared with highly processed foods (van
Dongen et al., 2012).
We also show, for the first time, that fat and carbohydrate
interact to potentiate reward, by demonstrating greater brain
response to, and increased willingness to pay for, equally caloric
foods containing fat and carbohydrate compared with fat or car-
bohydrate alone. We further show that these effects are not
accounted for by differences in food liking or energy density since
the interactive effects of fat and carbohydrate survive the inclu-
sion of these factors as covariates in statistical models. Finally,
we rule out portion size as a contributing factor because portion
size is unrelated to willingness to pay, which is consistent with a
recent report showing different patterns of evoked brain response
to food portion size and energy density (English et al., 2016).
Replicating prior work (Tang et al., 2014), irrespective of
macronutrient category bid amount was associated with BOLD
response in the anterior cingulate cortex and orbitofrontal cor-
tex, which has also been shown to code food attributes (Suzuki
et al., 2017). However, Tang et al. (2014) also reported associa-
tions between bid amount and energy density in the vmPFC and
striatum, which we did not observe when considering all food
items. Rather, we found that striatum (caudate and putamen/
globus pallidus) was selectively engaged when bidding for foods
that contain fat and carbohydrate, compared with fat or carbohy-
drate alone. This is of note because this area is thought to play an
important role in the shift from goal-directed to habitual control
over behavior, which is a fundamental characteristic of addiction
(Belin et al., 2009).
Relatedly, dopamine release in the dorsal striatum is sensitive
primarily to the nutritional, rather than the hedonic, properties of
foods (Tellez et al., 2016), with evidence for caudate dopamine
release in humans upon food consumption (Small et al., 2003)
and aberrant caudate BOLD responses to fat/sugar foods asso-
ciated with increased risk for weight gain (Stice et al., 2008; Sun
et al., 2015). Moreover, using an operant task in which fractal
cues are rewarded with snacks containing fat and carbohydrate,
Tricomi et al. (2009) show that increasing response in the puta-
men/globus pallidus (overlapping with the
putamen
peak
isolated here) is associated with the development of habitual re-
sponding. It is therefore possible that simultaneous striatal dopa-

tions at striatal sites and, in mice, a high-fat, high-sugar diet alters
striatal glutamate, opioid, and dopamine transmission (Fritz et al.,
2018). Regardless of the precise neurochemical mechanism, we
propose that foods that are more reinforcing (as measured by
willingness to pay) are more likely to lead to habit formation. If
so, one mechanism by which the modern food environment
may promote overeating is by combining fat and carbohydrate
to potentiate reward and therefore facilitate the transition to
habitual responding as is observed in drugs of abuse (Belin
et al., 2013). This proposal is based on the fact that foods high
in fat and carbohydrate rarely exist in nature; even breast milk
is on average about 3.5% fat and 7% carbohydrate (Ballard
and Morrow, 2013), whereas typical processed snack foods
contain closer to 24% fat and 57% carbohydrates (Table 1).
Study Limitations
Although we ensured all stimuli were equally familiar across
macronutrient groups, we did not explicitly measure frequency
of consumption of each item. This distinction could be relevant
given striatal activity of people who frequently consume ice
cream is blunted in response to an ice cream-like milkshake
(Burger and Stice, 2012) and repeated exposure to food
decreases activity in dopamine neurons that project to striatal re-
gions in response to that food (Schultz et al., 1993). Our effects
were in the opposite direction: increases in striatal activity
were associated with willingness to pay, but future studies
should include a measure of frequency of consumption to control
for this effect on striatal activity. Although our sample size was
sufficient here, a future study should include more participants
and expand the effect and food items to other regions of the
world, outside of western Europe.
Concluding Remarks
The current findings provide the first evidence that the rewarding
effects of fat and carbohydrates interact to potentiate reward

 and engagement of neural circuits involved in habit formation
and reward value. They also suggest that the association
between energy density and reward is distinct for fat and carbo-
hydrate, with energy density better appreciated at a cognitive
level for fatty foods and acting with fatty food liking to determine
reward. In contrast, liking, and not energy density, influences the
value of carbohydrate-containing and fat + carbohydrate-con-
taining foods. Portion size and estimated energy density,
whether accurate or not, played little role in reward in our
healthy-weight sample. However, individuals were better able
to estimate the energy density of fatty foods compared with
carbohydrate-containing and fat + carbohydrate-containing
foods, an ability that depends on connectivity between the
fusiform gyrus and the vmPFC. Overall, these results indicate
that combining fat and sugar increases the reward value of foods
independently of caloric load, liking, and portion size and
disrupts the ability to accurately estimate the energy density of
fatty foods.
These results imply that a potentiated reward signal generated
by foods high in both fat and carbohydrate may be one mecha-
nism by which a food environment rife with processed foods high
in fat and carbohydrate leads to overeating.

EXPERIMENTAL MODEL AND SUBJECT DETAILS
All procedures were approved by the ethics committee at the University of Cologne. Participants were recruited via flyers from the
local community and university population. All participants reported having no known metabolic, neurologic, and psychiatric
disorders. Fifty-six participants rated stimuli in a pre-testing session to validate the stimuli used. They had an average age of 25
(SEM ± 0.39) and an average BMI of 22.6 (SEM ± 0.2). They were Caucasian and 30 were male. For the fMRI portion of the study,
24 participants were recruited, but due to a technical error during scanning, data were discarded from 4. The resulting 20 participants
were Caucasian with an average age of 27.5 (SEM ±0.98), and an average BMI of 23.29 (SEM ±0.56). Twelve were female.
METHOD DETAILS
Pre-testing, Stimuli Selection, and Scales
A selection of photographs was created in house to ensure stimuli would be familiar to the local population, others were drawn from
an existing database (Blechert et al., 2014a). As described in the results section, stimuli were chosen to depict equi-caloric portions,
be similarly liked, and familiar. Liking was rated on a vertical scale, translated to German from English (Lim et al., 2009). Familiarity,
estimated energy density, and estimated portion calories were rated on horizontal scales.
Liking was rated on a vertical scale with ‘‘Staerkste Vorliebe, die vorstellbar ist’’ (most liked sensation imaginable) at the upper
anchor point and ‘‘Staerkste Abneigung, die vorstellbar ist’’ (most disliked sensation imaginable) at the lower anchor point (Lim
et al., 2009). Familiarity was rated on a horizontal scale with the prompt ‘‘Wie gut kennen Sie das Essen?’’ (How well do you know
this food), ‘‘gar nicht gut’’ (not well at all) at the left anchor point and ‘‘sehr gut’’ (very well) at the right anchor point. Participants
were asked calories per portion with the prompt ‘‘Wie viele Kalorien denken Sie hat hie hier abgebildete Portion?’’ (How many calories
do you think are in the pictured portion?). The scale was bounded on the left by ‘‘wenige Kalorien’’ (few calories) and the right by ‘‘viele
Kalorien’’ (many calories). Energy density of each item was asses by asking participants ‘‘Wie kalorienhaltig denken Sie ist das Essen
generell?’’ (How caloric do you think the food is, in general). This scale was bounded on the left by ‘‘niedrig kalorisch’’ (low caloric) and
‘‘hoch kalorisch’’ (high caloric).

 fMRI Session
Subjects entered the laboratory after an overnight fast. Blood was drawn to measure fasting insulin and glucose. Brain response was
assessed 3 hours after a standard breakfast containing 426 kcals, designed to have low glycemic index and low protein content (Tang
et al., 2014) on a 3T Siemens Prisma scanner while subjects performed the auction task. The auction task was presented using
Presentation software (Neurobehavioral Systems, Berkeley, CA, USA, RRID: SCR_002521). In this version of the Becker- de
Groot-Marschak task subjects are told they can bid between 0 and 5 euros for a displayed food item. At the end of the experiment,
one food item will be chosen at random, if they bid more than the computer, they will receive that food item, but the bid will come out
of their remuneration. Four 8-minute runs were performed on each participant. Over all runs, participants saw each of the 39 (13 from
each category) snack items 3 times. They were presented in a random order for 5 seconds, participants were then given 5 seconds to
bid. The ITI was 9 seconds (Figure 1H). Acquisition parameters for the echo planar images (EPI) were: TE=30ms, echo
spacing=0.7ms, TR=2s, flip angle= 90�, voxel size= 2.8 mm x 2.8 mm x 2.8 mm, number of slices=33. Sets of identical images,
but with opposite (posterior to anterior) phase encoding were collected to perform geometric distortion correction. A previously
collected high quality T1 weighted anatomical image (TE=2.23ms, TR=2.3s, flip angle=8� voxel sixe= 0.9x0.9) was used for registra-
tion of functional images.
QUANTIFICATION AND STATISTICAL ANALYSIS
Behavioral Analysis
Linear regressions were performed on behavioral data using GraphPad Prism version 7.0.1, (GraphPad Software, La Jolla, California,
USA, RRID: SCR_002798) and MATLAB 2014b (MathWorks, Natick, Massachusetts, USA, RRID: SCR_001622). All behavioral data
were plotted using GraphPad Prism. Linear mixed effects models (LME) were performed using MATLAB 2014b. In Figures 1, 2, S1,
and S2, the n=39 (the number of pictures rated), rather than the sample size. In all other figures n=20 (the number of participants).
A description of the regression or GLM for each result can be found in the appropriate location in the results section. All data
were treated as if they met parametric assumptions except for an ANOVA ran on beta weights from subject-wise regressions, as
they were not normally distributed tested by the D’Agostino and Pearson test of normality (K2=12.11, p=0.0023).
fMRI Analysis
Preprocessing
First, the susceptibility-induced off-resonance field was estimated using the opposite phase encoded images and a correction
applied using TOPUP (Andersson et al., 2003) implemented with FSL (Smith et al., 2004) (RRID: SCR_002823). Functional EPI images
were analyzed using FSL-FEAT (fMRI Expert Analysis Tool 6.0) part of FMRIB’s Software Library (FSL) (Smith et al., 2004). Using
FSL-FEAT, images were brain extracted, slice-time corrected, motion corrected, high-passed filtered, smoothed (8 mm FWHM),
and FILM pre-whitened. Images were registered to standard MNI space by first registering the EPI then to the T1-weighted
anatomical, then finally to standard space.
First and Second Level Models
To replicate Tang et al. (2014), two GLMs with distinct parametric modulators were created. In GLM1 willingness to pay for each trial
was entered as a parametric modulator orthogonalized with true energy density and in a second model, alone. They modulated the
picture viewing period which was modeled as a 4 second box-car. Bidding period and head movement were also included as regres-
sors of no interest.
To test our unique hypothesis, an additional GLM was created. This model contained estimated calories, true energy density,
hedonic value, and bid amount for each item broken out by macronutrient group, resulting in 3 main onsets with 4 parametric
modulators each. Picture viewing and bidding period were also included, as in the previous model. The contrast of combination
greater than either macronutrient alone was modeled on the first level to account for within subject variance. Six head motion regres-
sors were included as regressors of no interest.
To test brain correlates of energy density in fat versus carbohydrate groups, we created a final GLM containing energy density for
all three groups and nuisance regressors. The other regressors were left out of the model as they did not differ between the fat and
carbohydrate groups.
After first level modeling for all GLMs, the four runs were then combined for each participant using a fixed effects model. The
resulting contrast maps were analyzed on a third level using Flame1 (Smith et al., 2004) variance estimation and whole brain cluster
corrected at p<0.001, a significance threshold selected to reduce the risk of type I error (Eklund et al., 2016). Statistical maps are
presented as z-scores of the t-statistic and are overlaid on the MNI template and displayed using MRIcroN (Rorden and Brett,
2000). Finally, analyses of variance (ANOVA) and Student’s t-tests, where appropriate, were run on extracted parameter estimates
using GraphPad Prism, post-hoc differences between groups were tested and the resulting p-values were Bonferroni corrected and
reported.

 Influence of Gender on Primary Findings
To tests the role of gender in our main effect of macronutrient content on bid amount, we added gender as a covariate to our linear
mixed effects model. There was no main effect of gender in the model F(1,772)=0.22, p=0.6364 and the main effect of macronutrient
was still significant (p<0.000001). Gender, however, did not improve model fit and appeared to decrease model fit (as indicated
by AIC).
For our main neuroimaging findings of interest, we used a similar approach and entered gender as a covariate on the group level.
Adding gender as a covariate does not alter the main effects.

Figure S2. Related to Figure 4. The subgroup of images was similar to the whole in 
that equal calories were shown (A), they were equally familiar (B), and equally liked (C). 
Like the whole group, in the subset, FC images were estimated to be more energy 
dense (D) and were actually more energy dense (E). Reaction time did not differ across 
groups (F). Participants were willing to pay more for FC items in the subgroup (G). Data
