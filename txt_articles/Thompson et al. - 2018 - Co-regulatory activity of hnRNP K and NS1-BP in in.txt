Three of the eight RNA segments encoded by the influenza A virus (IAV) undergo alternative
splicing to generate distinct proteins. Previously, we found that host proteins hnRNP K and
NS1-BP regulate IAV M segment splicing, but the mechanistic details were unknown. Here we
show NS1-BP and hnRNP K bind M mRNA downstream of the M2 5′ splice site (5′ss). NS1-BP
binds most proximal to the 5′ss, partially overlapping the U1 snRNP binding site, while hnRNP
K binds further downstream and promotes U1 snRNP recruitment. Mutation of either or both
the hnRNP K and NS1-BP-binding sites results in M segment mis-splicing and attenuated IAV
replication. Additionally, we show that hnRNP K and NS1-BP regulate host splicing events and
that viral infection causes mis-splicing of some of these transcripts. Therefore, our proposed
mechanism of hnRNP K/NS1-BP mediated IAV M splicing provides potential targets of
antiviral intervention and reveals novel host functions for these proteins.

iruses share many gene processing steps with human cells
and have historically provided critical insight into mam-
malian processes. Indeed, pre-mRNA splicing was first
discovered through the study of viral RNA, and investigation of
viral RNA processing continues to reveal mechanistic insight into
host mRNA splicing and trafficking.
Influenza A virus (IAV) is an important human pathogen that
causes ~250,000 to 500,000 deaths per year worldwide1. In pan-
demic years, influenza infection can lead to even higher mortality
rates, as in 1918 when at least 20 million deaths occurred
worldwide2. Although vaccines and few antiviral drugs are
available, both are limited by antigenic drift and shift of the virus
as well as the development of resistance3. Therefore, it is crucial
to understand influenza virus-host interactions in order to
identify host vulnerabilities targeted by influenza virus that can
reveal new antiviral mechanisms and potentially be used to devise
new therapeutic options.
The IAV genome is comprised of 8 single-strand, negative-
sense, RNA segments4. Three of these segments, M, NS, and PB2
(also called 7, 8 and 1, respectively), undergo alternative spli-
cing4,5. Alternative splicing of the M and NS segments produces
two essential viral proteins each. For the M segment, the
unspliced M1 mRNA encodes the M1 matrix protein located
underneath the viral envelope, while intron removal leads to the
M2 mRNA, which encodes a proton channel protein (M2) that
allows acidification of the virus particle in the endosome/lyso-
some during viral entry4. Other roles of M2 include the promo-
tion of membrane scission during viral budding, the inhibition of
autophagic pathways6,7 and the recruitment of the host protein
Ubr4 to promote optimal surface expression of viral membrane
proteins8. Thus, an appropriate balance between M1 and M2
mRNAs must be produced in order to achieve an efficient viral
infection and replication, and regulation of the splicing of M1 to
M2 represents a fundamental step of viral-host interaction that is
a potential therapeutic target.
Splicing of both viral and host mRNAs is mediated by the
spliceosome, a dynamic enzymatic complex composed primarily
of 5 ribonucleoprotein particles (U1, U2, U4, U5 U6 snRNPs)9. The
association of the spliceosome with substrate is typically directed
by additional proteins that control the efficiency with which
splicing occurs at any given location10. We have previously shown
that removal of the M segment intron to produce the M2 mRNA
is promoted by the host proteins hnRNP K and NS1-BP (Fig. 1a)
11,12. Depletion of either hnRNP K and NS1-BP reduced the ratio
of M2 to M1 mRNA and inhibited viral replication. Moreover, we
further demonstrated that both hnRNP K and NS1-BP regulate M
RNA splicing via a nuclear speckle-dependent mechanism. We
found that NS1-BP is required for recruitment of M1 RNA to
speckles along with promoting splicing and export of M mRNAs,
while knockdown of hnRNP K causes a build-up of unspliced M1
RNA in these subnuclear structures12. This leads to a model in
which M1 RNA is recognized by NS1-BP, which facilitates M1
RNA localization to nuclear speckles where hnRNP K then pro-
motes M2 splicing (Fig. 1a).
NS1-BP was initially characterized as a nuclear speckle-
associated protein that interacts with IAV protein NS1 during
infection13. NS1-BP is a member of the kelch repeat superfamily
of proteins, with an N-terminal BTB/POZ domain and 6 kelch
repeats at the C-terminal predicted to fold into a β-propeller14.
Like many kelch repeat proteins, NS1-BP is functionally diverse,
being implicated in actin stabilization15, transcriptional regula-
tion16, and signal transduction17; however, to date, the only
connection of NS1-BP with splicing regulation has been with
regards to the IAV M segment11,12. By contrast, hnRNP K
contains 3 KH-type RNA-binding domains and has been pre-
viously shown to regulate numerous alternative splicing events in
both host and viral contexts18–21. HnRNP K also localizes to
nuclear speckles22 and interacts with NS1-BP in an RNA-
independent manner, although RNA enhances the interaction11.
Importantly, while our previous work set precedent for hnRNP K
and NS1-BP co-regulating M2 splicing, it remains unclear how
either protein mechanistically contributes to splicing regulation
and whether these proteins co-regulate additional splicing events
in a similar manner.
Here we use a combination of biochemistry, cell biology, and
mutant viruses to identify new regulatory sequences controlling
M1 to M2 splicing and define the mechanism of hnRNP K reg-
ulation of IAV M pre-mRNA splicing. Specifically, we find that
NS1-BP and hnRNP K bind to the M transcript at adjacent sites
just downstream of the M2 5′ splice site (5′ss). Association of
hnRNP K with its cognate site leads to recruitment of NS1-BP
and the U1 snRNP component of the spliceosome to the M2 5′ss.
Importantly, mutation of the hnRNP K binding site reduces IAV
M2 splicing and significantly attenuates viral replication. By
contrast, NS1-BP associates weakly with a pyrimidine-rich ele-
ment overlapping the 5′ss. This association appears to inhibit the
use of the 5′ss in viral-infected cells, perhaps aided by the viral
protein NS1. Thus, the balance of NS1, NS1-BP and hnRNP K
binding
to
the
M1
transcript
controls
the
efficiency
of
M2 splicing. Strikingly, we also find that NS1-BP and hnRNP K
coordinately regulate splicing of a set of host genes in the absence
of NS1 and that some of the splicing events are susceptible to mis-
regulation during viral infection. Therefore, our identification of
the mechanism of hnRNP K/NS1-BP regulation of IAV M spli-
cing provides potential new targets of antiviral intervention and
also reveals novel activities of these proteins in mammalian cell
biology.
Results
hnRNP K and NS1-BP regulate M1/M2 ratio in Influenza. In
order to study the mechanism of hnRNP K and NS1-BP reg-
ulation of splicing, we first confirmed previous qPCR data, which
showed that hnRNP K and NS1-BP regulate IAV M segment
splicing11, using the orthogonal approach of primer extension.
We infected A549 cells with the IAV strain A/PuertoRico/8/34
(PR8) for 12 h in the context of hnRNP K or NS1-BP siRNA
knockdown (Fig. 1b) and assayed M segment splicing using an
extension primer at position 903 (Fig. 1c-e). Because we are
interested in mRNA changes exclusively, and the M1 primer
extension product includes IAV mRNA and cRNA (the copy of
the genomic negative strand used for replication), we also used an
upstream 106 primer that can resolve the 10–13 nucleotide 5′ cap
included on the mRNA (Fig. 1c, top). From this, we calculated the
percentage of mRNA vs. cRNA in each condition (Fig. 1d),
allowing us to determine how much of the M1 band resolved with
the 903 primer was specifically mRNA. Comparing the M1
mRNA with the other M segment isoforms, we see that M1 to M2
mRNA ratio in mock cells is roughly equal (Fig. 1d, e, mock). By
contrast, knockdown of either hnRNP K or NS1-BP results in a
strong bias of M1 mRNA over M2, while M3 does not change
significantly between conditions (Fig. 1c–e). Importantly, the
changes we observe in PR8 M1 and M2 splicing as a result of
hnRNP K and NS1-BP depletion are fully consistent with our
previous observations made in A/WSN/336 strain, confirming the
generality of this regulatory program among influenza A viruses.
hnRNP K and NS1-BP bind adjacent sites within the M1
intron. As a first step to determining how hnRNP K and NS1-BP
target M RNA for splicing, we characterized the interactions of
hnRNP K and NS1-BP with M1 RNA. Previous data showed
hnRNP K binding to M1 RNA via UV-crosslinking assays, but

 the binding sequence was not determined11. To identify the site
(s) of hnRNP K binding to the M1 transcript, we made a series of
truncations of the M1 mRNA (Fig. 2a, additional truncations in
Supplementary Fig. 1) and carried out UV-crosslinking assays in
which uniformly radiolabeled, in vitro transcribed RNA was

extracts

conditions
(Fig. 2b–e). Identities of cross-linked species were confirmed via
immunoprecipitation (IP). As shown in Fig. 2b, multiple proteins
bind to the full-length M1 RNA (Full), including the ~65–70 kD
hnRNP K (lane 2). While hnRNP K is not the most prominent
protein bound to the full-length transcript, it binds robustly to the
first 106 nucleotides (1–106; note in all these experiments
migration of proteins following IP are slightly retarded compared
to total lane as confirmed by using recombinant protein (Sup-
plementary Fig. 1f)). By contrast, we observe reduced binding of
hnRNP K to a construct lacking the first 106 nucleotides (lanes 2
and 6), or to other sub-fragments of the region 107–1003 (Sup-
plementary Fig. 1b). Previous studies have shown that hnRNP K
binds preferentially to poly-cytosine (pC) tracts23. Notably,
mutation of two pC tracts at nt 69–71 and 78–84, respectively
(pC-mut, Fig. 2a) abrogates hnRNP K cross-linking to the 1–106
fragment (Fig. 2c, lanes 2 vs. 5). A similar result was also observed
upon removal of the pC tracts by truncation at nucleotide 68
(Fig. 2a, d, lanes 2 vs. 5). Therefore, while hnRNP K may bind at
some level to multiple sites along M1, we conclude that the pC
tract within nucleotides 69–84 represent a major binding site for
hnRNP K within M1. As this site is proximal to the regulated M2
5′ss, we focused on this binding site in subsequent studies below.
Interestingly, upon either mutation or deletion of the pC tracts,
we observe a crosslinking signal for NS1-BP (Fig. 2c, d, lanes 3 vs.
6). This is surprising because NS1-BP is not known to contain
any canonical RNA-binding domains14. Thus, our crosslinking
result suggests NS1-BP either binds RNA through a non-
canonical
interaction,
a

by
recent
studies24,25, or is in extremely close proximity to the RNA via
protein-protein interaction with another RBP(s). Upon further
truncations of the M1 transcript, we determined the NS1-BP
binding to be enriched within the M1 intron between nucleotides
51 and 68 (Fig. 2a, d, lanes 4, 6, and 9, Supplementary Fig. 1).

 linking to be dependent on a poly-pyrimidine (pY) tract at nt
55–60 (Fig. 2e, lanes 3–4; additional mutations in Supplementary
Fig. 1). To confirm that the NS1-BP cross-link species is not the
result of antibody cross-reaction, we looked to see if other RNPs
identified to interact with NS1-BP and/or bind to poly-
pyrimidine sequences produce the same crosslinking species
(Supplementary Fig. 1e). In all cases, the specific cross-link
species is unique to NS1-BP antibody.
Given the potential caveats with using highly truncated and
radiolabeled RNAs in UV crosslinking, we also used a cross-link
immunoprecipitation RT-PCR (CLIP-PCR) approach with full-
length M1 RNA to further assessed the importance of the pC and
pY tracts in the recruitment of hnRNP K and NS1-BP. Following
crosslinking, hnRNP K and NS1-BP were immunoprecipitated
and bound M1 probes were quantified using RT-PCR (Fig. 2f, gel
shown in Supplemental Fig. 2). Consistent with the crosslinking
results of the RNA fragments, mutation of the pY markedly
reduces precipitation of M1 with the NS1-BP antibody, while
having no effect on M1 association with hnRNP K. By contrast,
mutation of the pC tract reduces precipitation of M1 with hnRNP
K, supporting the conclusion that the pC tract is the primary
binding site for hnRNP K within the M1 transcript. Interestingly,
however, we do find that NS1-BP association with M1 is also
reduced by the pC mutation (Fig. 2f). Given the known
interaction between NS1-BP and hnRNP K, we interpret this
data as revealing that hnRNP K bound to the pC sequence helps
stabilize the binding of NS1-BP to adjacent pY tract. The lack of
apparent NS1-BP signal in the crosslinking to the radiolabeled

 1–106 (Fig. 2c, d) is likely due to the overwhelming labeling of the
pC tract with 32P-CTP and signal from the tight interaction with
hnRNP K.
As an orthogonal method to further assess association of
hnRNP K and NS1-BP with the M1 RNA, we biotinylated
fragments of M1, incubated with nuclear extract and assessed co-
associated proteins by western blot (Fig. 3a, b). Although this
assay detects both direct as well as indirect association with RNA,
the results are entirely consistent with the CLIP-PCR results.
Specifically, NS1-BP association with the 1–106 fragment is
reduced by both the pY or pC mutations, alone or in
combination, while hnRNP K binding is only reduced upon
mutation of the pC tract. Since we ultimately sought to
understand how hnRNP K and NS1-BP influence removal of
the M1 intron, we also blotted the affinity purification samples for
core components of the spliceosome. Specifically, we assessed the
presence of large ribonucleoprotein, U1 snRNP, which binds the
5′ss in the first steps of intron removal9. The M2 5′ss is the one
splicing signal completely contained within the constructs used in
the RNA-affinity experiments. Strikingly, we find clear associa-
tion of U1 snRNP-specific proteins U1A and U170 K with the M1
1–106 construct in a manner that directly mirrors the association
of hnRNP K (Fig. 3b). The dependence of U1A and U1 70K
association on the pC tract, which is well outside the 5′-ss
recognition region of the U1 snRNP, implies that the presence of
hnRNP K promotes binding of the U1 snRNP to the M2 5′-ss.
To test U1 snRNP association more directly, we turned to
AMT psoralen cross-linking, which captures RNA–RNA base-
pairs
formed
between
the
U1
snRNP
RNA
component,
U1 snRNA, and the 5′ss. As shown in Fig. 3c, d, AMT psoralen
induced cross-links of WT M1 RNA as visualized by termination
of primer extension (Fig. 3c, lanes 2–3). Location of the M2 5′ss
region was determined by parallel dideoxy-sequencing ladders
(Supplementary Fig. 3a). Comparison of lanes 2 and 3 reveals a
reduction in signal at the M2 5′ss upon depletion of U1 snRNA to
~30% of wild-type levels (Supplementary Fig. 3b). Subtraction of
the cross-link signal in lane 3 from lane 2 yields a value for
U1-dependent cross-links at the M2 5′ss (Fig. 3d, full explanation

 of quantification is addressed in methods). Consistent with the
RNA affinity results, the same analysis of U1 cross-linking at the
M2 5′ss in the context of the pC-mut shows that U1 crosslinking
is decreased by 51% (Fig. 3c, d, lanes 2 vs. 5). Taken together, we
conclude that the pY tract adjacent to the M2 5′ss is required for
NS1-BP association with the M1 intron in conjunction with
hnRNP K, while the presence of the pC tract results in direct
binding of hnRNP K and recruitment of the U1 snRNP to the M2
5′ss.
hnRNP K and NS1-BP-binding sites regulate M2 splicing.
Having identified binding sites for hnRNP K and NS1-BP, we
next sought to determine the functional relevance of the pY and
pC sequences to M1 to M2 splicing using a previously established
reverse genetics system to engineer mutations in the pY and/or
pC tracts in the PR8 IAV strain (Fig. 4a)26. Of note, these
mutations differ from the ones used in the binding studies so as to
preserve the amino acid sequence of the M segment; however, we
confirmed these mutations still impact hnRNP K and NS1-BP
binding (binding data in Supplementary Fig. 4). We measured M
segment splicing of WT and PR8 mutants at 6 h post infection in
A549 cells using primer extension as in Fig. 1 (Fig. 4a–c). Con-
sistent with the demonstration that hnRNP K binding to the pC
tract promotes recruitment of the U1 snRNP, mutation of the pC-
tract results in a 13% decrease in the production of spliced M2
and a corresponding increase in the unspliced M1 (Fig. 4b, lane
3). Similar results were also observed 12 h post-infection (Sup-
plementary Fig. 4c). Importantly, the pC mutant virus also
exhibits a significant defect in replication (p < 0.05), underscoring
the importance of appropriate splicing for the viral cycle (Fig. 4d).
Surprisingly, however, we find that mutation of the pY
sequence enhances splicing at the M2 5′ss, as shown by a sharp
increase in M2 production relative to M1 either on its own or in

 combination with the pC mutation (Fig. 4b, lane 2 and 4; and
Fig. 4c). While this is opposite to the effect of NS1-BP depletion
(Fig. 1d, e), we note that the pY tract overlaps with the U1 and U6
recognition sites at the 5′ss. Therefore, we conclude that
association of NS1-BP with the pY sequence likely sterically
hinders formation of the spliceosome on the M2 5′ss. However, it
was still unclear why the pY mutation does not phenocopy the
depletion of NS1-BP. Notably, in Fig. 3, we did not detect NS1-BP
bound to the pY mutant RNA, but this was in the absence of the
viral NS1 protein that is present in these infection experiments.
To ask if NS1 alters association of NS1-BP with the M1 RNA, we
repeated the RNA-affinity experiment in the presence of
recombinant NS1. Strikingly, we find that in the presence of
NS1, association of NS1-BP with the M1 transcript is no longer
dependent on the pY sequence, although it is still dependent on
the presence of hnRNP K (Fig. 4e). Consistently, by immuno-
fluorescence, we find no difference in the trafficking of wild type
versus pY mutant M1 to speckles or the cytoplasm (Fig. 5), which
we have previously shown to be dependent on NS1-BP and
NS112. Thus, we conclude that NS1 stabilizes NS1-BP association
with M1 even in the absence of the pY sequence. On the other
hand, both the pC and pCpY mutant M1 exhibit the same
retention in the speckles and depletion from the cytoplasm as we
have observed previously upon depletion of hnRNP K12.
Importantly, the increased speckle localization of the pC and
pCpY mutant is not merely a consequence of increased
nucleoplasmic concentrations, as other perturbations that retain
M mRNA in the nucleus, such as NS1 knockout, do not increase
nuclear speckle localization12. Thus, these data further indicate
that hnRNP K functions through the pC tract. Moreover, the loss
of cytoplasmic trafficking provides an explanation for the
inhibited replication of the pC and pCpY mutant viruses (Fig. 4d).
Taken together, these data provide explanation for how hnRNP K
and NS1-BP binding to specific M segment RNA elements
directly results in regulation of IAV mRNA splicing, mRNA
localization, and replication.
NS1-BP and hnRNP K co-operatively regulate host splicing.
Although NS1-BP has been studied with respect to IAV and the
viral NS1 protein, its role in uninfected cells has not been well
characterized. Our observation that NS1-BP associates with RNA
in the absence of virus caused us to ask if NS1-BP might have
activity as a regulator of splicing of human genes. We therefore

alternative exons in A549 cells in the absence or presence of
knockdown of NS1-BP or hnRNP K using the previously
described RASL platform27. Briefly, cells were depleted of NS1-BP
or hnRNP K as in Fig. 1 and then total RNA was collected and
subjected to RASL-Seq (see Methods section) to score for inclu-
sion (Percent Spliced In or PSI) of interrogated exons. Exons that

role of hnRNP K as a splicing regulator, we observed that splicing
of ~200 out of the ~5500 exons surveyed are dependent on
hnRNP K (Fig. 6a, Supplementary Data 1). We also found ~120
exons that are regulated in an NS1-BP-dependent manner
(Fig. 6a, Supplementary Data 1). Remarkably, almost all of the
NS1-BP-dependent exons were also dependent on hnRNP K
(Fig. 6a), and were regulated in the same direction by both
hnRNP K and NS1-BP (Fig. 6b). Indeed, RT-PCR failed to con-
firm the few instances in which the RASL-Seq analysis suggested
that NS1-BP regulated an exon apart from hnRNP K (Fig. 6a, 14
NS1-BP only exons) or in an opposite direction (Fig. 6b, upper

 left or bottom right quadrant, Supplementary Table 1). By con-
trast, instances of predicted co-regulation by hnRNP K and NS1-
BP were well validated by RT-PCR (Fig. 6c, Supplementary
Table 1). The limited scope of splicing events interrogated by
RASL-seq makes it unfeasible to assess sequence enrichment
within the hnRNP K and NS1-BP co-regulated genes. However,
we do see obvious proximal pY and pC-tracts downstream of
hnRNP K and NS1-BP-binding sites downstream of several
regulated 5′ss in host genes (see Discussion section). Taken
together, these data reveals a previously unappreciated function
for NS1-BP in host gene regulation and suggests that IAV has
hijacked a pre-existing widespread cellular splicing regulatory
relationship between hnRNP K and NS1-BP to carry out its own
M1 to M2 splicing.
Having established that IAV protein, NS1, can contribute to
hnRNP K and NS1-BP RNA association (Fig. 4e), we wondered if
IAV infection has any influence on hnRNP K and NS1-BP
dependent splicing events. Remarkably, we find that IAV
infection induces misregulation of hnRNP K and NS1-BP
regulated splicing events. Specifically, we assessed 6 validated
hnRNP K and NS1-BP co-regulated splicing events in the context
of IAV infection via RT-PCR (Fig. 6d) and observed alterations in
4 out of 6. Notably, the impact of IAV infection on splicing
implies two distinct mechanisms. For CASP8 and INF2 the
impact of IAV was opposite of what we observed upon hnRNP K
and NS1-BP knockdown, while splicing of M-RIP and IL-15 in
IAV-infected cells phenocopied hnRNP K or NS1-BP depletion.
Together, these data show that IAV influences, with some
specificity and variety, hnRNP K and NS1-BP regulated splicing
events, suggesting new paradigms for the impact of IAV infection
upon host gene regulation (see Discussion section).
Discussion
Combining our previous knowledge of M segment splicing at the
level of RNA localization12 and our current data that explores
hnRNP K and NS1-BP interaction with M RNA, we propose a
detailed model of M segment splicing during IAV infection
(Fig. 7a). First, outside the speckle we suggest that NS1, NS1-BP
and hnRNP K bind to the M1 transcript in a manner that sta-
bilizes NS1-BP association with pY-tract directly downstream of
the M2 5′ss (Fig. 7a, bottom-left complex). This complex likely
prevents inappropriate splicing of the transcript until such time
that the transcript is localized to speckles. Once in the speckle
(Fig. 7a, upper-left complex), we propose that the high con-
centration of U1 snRNP and/or dissociation of NS1 results in a
remodeling in which hnRNP K recruits U1 snRNP to the M2 5′ss
to promote splicing (Fig. 7a, upper-right complex). In this model,
weakening of the NS1-BP interaction over the 5′ss by mutation of
the pY tract is not sufficient to destabilize the initial NS1/NS1-BP/
hnRNP K complex (Fig. 7a, bottom-left complex) but is predicted
to shift the equilibrium inside the speckle in the forward direction
(Fig. 7a, upper-left to upper-right complex), whereas mutation of
the pC tract or depletion of hnRNP K would have the opposite
effect by failing to promote U1 snRNA binding, thereby limiting
splicing (Fig. 7a).
This model takes into consideration previous findings showing
that upon IAV infection NS1-BP is re-distributed throughout the
nucleus before returning to nuclear speckles13, that depletion of
either NS1-BP or NS1 results in reduced recruitment of M
transcript to speckles12, and that NS1 is a direct RNA binder28
and splicing repressor29,30. In addition, this model incorporates
all of our binding data, including the dependence of hnRNP K
binding on the pC tract with or without NS1 (Figs. 2, 3b and 4e),

 and the fact that NS1 and hnRNP K can together stabilize indirect
association of NS1-BP with M1 even in the absence of the pY
tract (Fig. 4e). Finally, the functional impact of the pY and pC
mutations (Fig. 3c, d, Fig. 4a-d, Fig. 5), also are consistent with
this model in that the pY mutation increases splicing once in
speckles, whereas mutation of pC decreases production of M2.
Importantly, the model we propose implies a dual function of
NS1-BP, in which NS1-BP not only regulates mRNA localization
as previously shown, but also directly contributes to splicing
regulation. Such a two-function model is consistent with the fact
that mutation of the pY-tract disrupts direct association of NS1-
BP with M1 (Figs. 2e, 3b, Supplementary Fig. 4) and mis-
regulates splicing (Fig. 4), but does not alter the transport activity
of NS1-BP (Fig. 5). Moreover, this model accounts for why
mutation of the pY-tract has a different impact on M1/M2 pro-
duction as does depletion of NS1-BP (Fig. 4e). In sum, our data,
together with previous studies, support a role for NS1-BP in
controlling the spatial and temporal access of the M transcript to
the splicing machinery through both subnuclear localization as
well as direct competition.
It is possible that the displacement of NS1-BP from the pY is
itself sufficient to render the M2 5′ss accessible to the U1 snRNP,
however, the fact that we observe increased production of M2 in
the pY mutant versus the pCpY double mutant (Fig. 4) suggests
that hnRNP K plays an active role in recruiting U1 snRNP.
Importantly, hnRNP K has previously been shown to interact
with components of the U1 snRNP, providing a possible
mechanism for hnRNP K-dependent U1 snRNP recruitment31,32.
Finally, we do not rule out the possibility that NS1-BP might also
help to promote U1 snRNP recruitment (Fig. 7a, upper-right
complex). While NS1-BP does not associate strongly with M1
RNA in the absence of the pY tract and NS1, recent work from
our groups have shown that NS1-BP does interact with the U1A
component of the U1 snRNP in an RNA-dependent manner
(Zhang and Fontoura, personal communication), suggesting that
this interaction could contribute to the overall stability (Fig. 7a,
upper-right complex).
In comparison to other examples of alternative splicing,
hnRNP K binding within the M1 intron resembles previous work
showing that hnRNP K binds within the intron of chicken β-
tropomyosin pre-mRNA to promote exon inclusion21. Moreover,
specific subsets of intron-retained transcripts have been proposed
to be regulated post-transcriptionally, comparable to the M seg-
ment example33–35. Indeed, we identified over 100 splicing events
that are co-regulated by hnRNP K and NS1-BP (Fig. 6). While
hnRNP K has previously been shown to regulate splicing18–21,
nor NS1-BP, or any member of the kelch repeat superfamily, have
ever been described as a broad splicing regulator. Strikingly,
NS1-BP regulated splicing events almost exclusively overlapped
hnRNP K-regulated events, indicating widespread cooperation
between these two proteins. Within these co-regulated events, we
see potential hnRNP K- and NS1-BP-binding motifs downstream
of regulated 5′ss (Fig. 7b). In particular, in host genes Interleukin
15
(IL15)
and
cortactin
(CTTN),
we
find
pY-
and
pC-tracts adjacent to one another and downstream of the pro-
moted 5′ss; a configuration that is exactly reminiscent of the M
segment (compare Fig. 7a, b). Importantly, while the alternative
5′ss splicing example of IL15 closely resembles the M segment,
the CTTN example represents a cassette exon, suggesting that
hnRNP K and NS1-BP could regulate a broad set of diverse
splicing events using similar sequence motifs.
Although due to the relatively small sample size, gene ontology
analysis did not suggest any significantly enriched classes of genes
represented in the hnRNP K and NS1-BP co-regulated exon,
several of the pre-mRNAs co-regulated by NS1-BP and hnRNP K
encode proteins known to have a role in apoptosis and immunity
(CASP8 and IL15). Since these are pathways regulated during
virus infection, it is possible that this co-regulatory splicing of
host pre-mRNAs by NS1-BP and hnRNP K may impact immu-
nity and cell death, which is a topic for future investigation.
Interestingly, we find that IAV infection resulted in the mis-
splicing of several of the hnRNP K- and NS1-BP-regulated
transcripts we tested. In some cases IAV infection mimicked
depletion of hnRNP K and NS1-BP, while in other cases the
activities of these proteins seemed to be enhanced (Fig. 6d).
Further investigation will be required to fully understand the set
of
mechanism(s)
by
which
viral
infection
alters
hnRNP
K/NS1-BP-dependent splicing; however, these data suggest that
alternative splicing may be a critical component of a host-viral
response to IAV. Importantly, such a conclusion is supported by
recent work by others demonstrating reovirus influence on host
splicing36, HCMV regulation of alternative poly-adenylation37,
and HSV regulation of splicing and poly-adenylation38.
Methods
Cell culture. Human lung adenocarcinoma epithelial cells (A549) were cultured in
RPMI 1640 (Corning: 10-040-CV), 10% heat-inactivated FBS (Gibco: 16000-044),
and 100 units per ml Pen/Strep antibiotics. MDCK cells were cultured in high-
glucose DMEM (Corning: 10-013-CV), 10% heat-inactivated FBS (Gibco) and 100
units per ml Pen/Strep antibiotics. All cells were maintained at 37 °C with
5% CO2. Cells were tested negative for mycoplasma. Cell lines were obtained and
authenticated by ATCC (A549: CCL-185, MDCK: PTA-6500).
Viruses. Wild type and mutant M sequences from either A/Puerto Rico/8/1934
(PR8) or A/WSN/1933 (WSN) strains were gene synthesized in vitro (Thermo-
Fisher Scientific) and cloned into PDZ vector SapI restriction site, respectively.
Standard reverse genetics were used to rescue each individual virus as previously
described26, followed by plaque purification and propagation in MDCK cells.
Finally, viral titers were determined through plaque assay calculated as the average
of replicates and full genome deep sequencing was conducted on the Illumina
MiSeq platform to confirm viral sequences.
RNA interference and transfections. siRNA was purchased from Dharmacon
(NS1-BP: SMARTpool, M-016604-02, hnRNP K: SMARTpool, M-011692-00). 2 ×
105 A549 cells (6-well format) were transfected with 50 nM siRNA using 1.5 µl
RNAiMAX (ThermoFisher: 56532) per 25 pmol siRNA and incubated for 48 h in
antibiotic-free media. Knockdown efficiency was assessed via Western blot.
Infections. For infections, 8 × 105 A549 cells (6-well format) were washed with PBS
and inoculated with 200 µl virus diluted in PBS•BA (DPBS with Ca and Mg
(Corning: 21-031-CV), 0.2% BSA (Lampire: 7500810), and 100 units per ml
Pen/Strep antibiotics) for 1 h at room temperature (22 °C). Cells were then washed
with PBS and incubated in Infection media (1 × MEM, 0.2% BSA, 10 mM HEPES
buffer, 0.12% NaHCO3, 100 units per ml Pen/Strep antibiotics, and 0.2 µg/ml
TPCK trypsin (Sigma: SLB58956)) at 37 °C with 5% CO2 until desired time-point.
At cell collection, wells were rinsed with PBS and cells were either pelleted and
lysed with RIPA buffer for Western blot analysis or RNA was extracted using RNA-
Bee (amsbio: CS-501B).
Primer extension. A concentration of 1.5 µg input RNA was hybridized with
excess 32P-labeled reverse primer (sequences in Supplementary Data 2) in H2O by
boiling 5 min, cooling to 4 °C for 4 min, and equilibrating at 45 °C for 4 min. Pre-
warmed 2 × Ext-Buffer (100 mM Tris-HCl pH 8.0, 80 mM KCl, 12 mM MgCl2, 20
mM DTT, 1 mM dNTPs, and 50 U MMLV-RT (Thermofisher: 28025013)) was
added to each reaction and incubated at 45 °C for 90 min. Reactions were dena-
tured by boiling in formamide loading buffer and resolved on 5% denaturing poly-
acrylamide (acrylamide/bis 19:1, BioRad: 1610144) gels.
Antibodies. Antibody concentrations for immunoprecipitations and immuno-
blotting were determined empirically. All immunoblot antibodies were diluted as
specified in 5% (w/v) BSA-TBST. Antibodies were purchased and used as follows:
NS1-BP (Bethyl A302-879A, 1:2000 immunoblot, 4 µg IP), hnRNP K (Abcam
ab39975, 1:1000 immunoblot, 4 µg IP), hnRNP E2 (Abcam ab77323, 2 µg IP),
U2AF65 (Sigma U4758, 8 µg IP), hnRNP A1 (Abcam ab5832, 4 µg IP), PTBP1
(EMD MABE986, 1:1000 immunoblot, 4 µg IP), U1A (Abcam ab55751, 1:1000
immunoblot) U170K (Abcam ab51266, 1:1000 immunoblot), Tubulin (Abcam
ab6046, 1:10,000 immunoblot), and NS1 (gift from García-Sastre lab, 1:1000
immunoblot).

 Ultraviolet crosslinking. UV-crosslinking assays were performed as previously
described using JSL1 nuclear extracts12. M1 RNA substrates were generated from
linearized plasmids and PCR fragments (sequences in Supplementary Data 2) using
T7 polymerase and 32P-CTP to label the RNA throughout its length. Probes were
specifically labeled with a labeled to unlabeled cytosine ratio of 1:30 in Fig. 1b. In all
other cross-linking experiments hot to cold ratios were adjusted so that probes had
equal 32P-CTP/mol probe. Immunoprecipitations after crosslinking were per-
formed overnight in 400 µl RIPA buffer at 4 °C rotating end-over-end.
CLIP-PCR. CLIP-PCR experiments were performed as follows. Unlabeled in vitro
transcribed full-length M1 RNA probes were UV-cross-linked with JSL1 nuclear
extract as described above (Methods section, Ultraviolet crosslinking). Post
crosslinking 1% of input was removed before reaction was immunoprecipitated
overnight in RIPA buffer. Immunoprecipitated complexes were purified using
Invitrogen magnetic Dynabeads (Cat #10004D). RNA was then extracted using
phenol chloroform isoamyl alcohol and EtOH precipitation. All samples were then
subjected to low-cycle radiolabeled RT-PCR. A common PCR cycle number where
all samples were within the linear detection range of the RT-PCR assay was
determined empirically (Supplementary Fig. 2). Immunoprecipjtation percentage
was calculated after dividing densitometry signal for immunoprecipitated samples
by total input signal and multiplying by 100. Immunoprecipjtation percentage
values were then normalized to values calculated for the WT probe.
RNA affinity. RNA affinity experiments were performed as previously described39.
Briefly, in vitro transcribed RNA probes generated from PCR templates (sequences
in Supplementary Data 2) were biotin labeled using a kit (Pierce 20160) according
to manufacturer’s instructions. 25 pmols of labeled RNA was incubated with 100 µg
JSL1 nuclear extract under splicing conditions and bound to 30 µl streptavidin
beads (Pierce: 53114). For NS1 experiments, 750 ng of recombinant MBP-tagged
NS1 was added to nuclear extract before addition of RNA probe. RNA-protein-
bead complexes were eluted in 2 × SDS loading buffer and resolved with 10%
SDS-PAGE (acrylamide/bis 37.5:1, BioRad: 1610158). Eluate was visualized using
Western blot and Biorad Silver Stain Plus Kit (cat #: 1610449).
AMT psoralen crosslinking. Cross-linking reactions were performed as previously
described with slight modifications40. Briefly, splicing complexes were assembled
for 20 min at 30 °C in JSL1 nuclear extracts ± U1 snRNP. U1 snRNP was depleted
by RNase H cleavage of U1 snRNA using a complimentary oligonucleotide
(5′-TTCAGGTAAGTACTCA-3′) (Supplementary Fig. 3). AMT psoralen (Sigma,
A4330) was added to each reaction to a final concentration of 40 µg/ml. Reactions
were irradiated with 365 nm light for 10 min on ice. Cross-linked products were
detected using 32P-labeled primer extension at 106 nt position (sequences in
Supplementary Data 2). Products were resolved with 15% PAGE (acrylamide/bis
19:1, BioRad: 1610144) and nucleotide positions were determined using a dideoxy-
sequencing ladder with the same primer (Supplementary Fig. 3). Arbitrary U1
cross-link units were determined by densitometry. Briefly, signal at putative U1
snRNA-binding sites when U1 snRNP was depleted was subtracted from corre-
sponding signal when U1 snRNP was not depleted and then divided by total signal
when U1 was present.
RNA FISH and immunofluorescence. RNA FISH and immunofluorescence were
performed as we have recently described12.
RASL-seq and RT-PCR. RASL-seq was performed as previously described using a
set of probes that interrogate ~5600 specific alternative splicing events27,41,42. Total
RNA was harvested from A549 cells 48 h post 50 nM siRNA treatment in triplicate.
RASL libraries were generated, barcoded, and sequenced on a HiSeq 2000. RASL
events were then filtered for any event with an average read depth of 10 across all
samples (Supplementary Data 1). Significant splicing events were considered any
event with a p-value < 0.05 and ΔPSI value > |10|. Validations of splicing events
were determined using 32P-labeled, low-cycle, RT-PCR with sequence-specific
primers (sequences in Supplementary Data 2).
Ultraviolet crosslinking of recombinant protein. UV-cross-linking assays were
performed as previously described using JSL1 nuclear extracts12. M1 RNA sub-
strates were generated from linearized plasmids and PCR fragments (sequences in
Supplementary Data 2) using T7 polymerase and 32P-CTP to label the RNA
throughout its length. Labeled transcripts were incubated with 500 ng recombinant
protein under splicing conditions for 30 min at 30 °C. Immunoprecipitations after
cross-linking were performed overnight in 400 µl RIPA buffer at 4 °C rotating end-
over-end.
