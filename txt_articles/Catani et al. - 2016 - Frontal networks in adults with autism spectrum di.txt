It has been postulated that autism spectrum disorder is underpinned by an ‘atypical connectivity’ involving higher-order association
brain regions. To test this hypothesis in a large cohort of adults with autism spectrum disorder we compared the white matter
networks of 61 adult males with autism spectrum disorder and 61 neurotypical controls, using two complementary approaches to
diffusion tensor magnetic resonance imaging. First, we applied tract-based spatial statistics, a ‘whole brain’ non-hypothesis driven
method, to identify differences in white matter networks in adults with autism spectrum disorder. Following this we used a tract-
specific analysis, based on tractography, to carry out a more detailed analysis of individual tracts identified by tract-based spatial
statistics. Finally, within the autism spectrum disorder group, we studied the relationship between diffusion measures and autistic
symptom severity. Tract-based spatial statistics revealed that autism spectrum disorder was associated with significantly reduced
fractional anisotropy in regions that included frontal lobe pathways. Tractography analysis of these specific pathways showed
increased mean and perpendicular diffusivity, and reduced number of streamlines in the anterior and long segments of the arcuate
fasciculus, cingulum and uncinate—predominantly in the left hemisphere. Abnormalities were also evident in the anterior portions of
the corpus callosum connecting left and right frontal lobes. The degree of microstructural alteration of the arcuate and uncinate
fasciculi was associated with severity of symptoms in language and social reciprocity in childhood. Our results indicated that autism
spectrum disorder is a developmental condition associated with abnormal connectivity of the frontal lobes. Furthermore our findings
showed that male adults with autism spectrum disorder have regional differences in brain anatomy, which correlate with specific
aspects of autistic symptoms. Overall these results suggest that autism spectrum disorder is a condition linked to aberrant develop-
mental trajectories of the frontal networks that persist in adult life.

Introduction
Approximately 1% of the population have an autistic spec-
trum disorder (ASD), with a male:female ratio of 2.5:1 (Lai
et al., 2014). Recent advances in brain imaging have
enabled in vivo mapping of the structural and functional
characteristics associated with ASD. Several structural neu-
roimaging
studies
have
implicated
abnormalities
in
a
number of brain regions, including the frontal and tem-
poral cortex, the caudate nucleus, cerebellum, amygdala
and hippocampus (Abell et al., 1999; Waiter et al., 2004;
McAlonan et al., 2005, 2008; Brieber et al., 2007; Craig
et al., 2007; Bonilha et al., 2008; Ke et al., 2008; Lange et
al., 2010; Toal et al., 2010; Cauda et al., 2011; Via et al.,
2011; Nickl-Jockschat et al., 2012; Nordahl et al., 2012).
Functional neuroimaging studies have also reported altered
activation of these regions during tasks involving social,
emotion and language processing (Baron-Cohen et al.,
1999; Pierce et al., 2001; Just et al., 2004; Ashwin et al.,
2007; Philip et al., 2012). However, some of these findings
have not been consistently replicated (Stigler et al., 2011).
Inconsistency amongst previous findings is probably due
to a variety of factors including small sample sizes, failure
to apply strict diagnostic criteria and variability in con-
founding factors such as age and IQ (Freitag et al.,
2009). In addition, the majority of previous studies ana-
lysed only grey matter at the cortical and subcortical
level. However, these regions do not function independ-
ently; rather they are interconnected through a complex
system of short- and long-range tracts running within the
white matter of each hemisphere (Catani and Bambini,
2014).
White
matter
tract
‘connectivity’
regulates
the
speed and timing of activation across neural networks.
These factors are necessary for optimum performance of
higher-order tasks that rely on integrated information pro-
cessing (Fields, 2008).
‘Atypical connectivity’ theories of ASD have postulated
that higher-order association areas of the brain are partially
disconnected during development (Belmonte et al., 2004;
Frith, 2004; Courchesne and Pierce, 2005; Geschwind
and Levitt, 2007; Just et al., 2012). Regional white
matter structural abnormalities in ASD have been reported
using different methods, from early region of interest
approaches on structural MRI scans to, more recently,
tract-specific virtual dissections of diffusion tensor MRI
(DT-MRI) datasets (for a recent review see Ameis and
Catani, 2015). Both approaches are mainly hypothesis
driven and have therefore usually been limited to single
regions or specific tracts (Aoki et al., 2013), such as the
midsagittal portion of the corpus callosum (Frazier and
Hardan, 2009), or the core of the arcuate and uncinate
fasciculus (Hardan et al., 2000; Fletcher et al., 2010), but
sample sizes have tended to be small (Billeci et al., 2012;
Travers et al., 2012; Mueller et al., 2013). Other studies
based on meta-analytical approaches (Radua et al., 2011;
Aoki et al., 2013; Cauda et al., 2014), voxel-based morph-
ometry (Barnea-Goraly et al., 2004; Keller et al., 2007;
Cheung et al., 2009; Ke et al., 2009; Lee et al., 2009;
Bloemen et al., 2010; Noriuchi et al., 2010; Groen et al.,
2011; Jou et al., 2011), and tract-based spatial statistics
(TBSS) (Barnea-Goraly et al., 2010; Cheng et al., 2010;
Sahyoun et al., 2010; Jou et al., 2011; Shukla et al., 2010;
Walker et al., 2012) have attempted to overcome some of
the limitations attributable to small sample size and/or oper-
ator-dependent biases. However, it remains unclear whether
the findings, if replicated in larger studies, are indicative of
tract-specific anomalies in ASD or part of a more generalized
brain abnormality (Wolff et al., 2012). Therefore in this
study we used two complementary approaches to analyse
white matter connections in adults with ASD.
First, we applied TBSS (Smith et al., 2006). This is a
fully automated, operator-independent approach that per-
mits a whole-brain analysis of white matter integrity in a
voxel-wise manner. It has the potential to identify white
matter differences in regions not previously considered to
be of importance in a particular cohort and is resistant
to operator bias. However, TBSS is affected by partial
volume
effects
in
regions
accurate
localization
of
between-group differences within specific tracts can be dif-
ficult with TBSS, as differences are often found in regions
containing more than one tract (Catani, 2006). Therefore,
after identifying regions of interest using TBSS, our second
approach focused on specific tracts in greater detail using
an approach based on DT-MRI tractography.

 DT-MRI tractography facilitates the reconstruction of
3D trajectories of specific white matter tracts and probe
their microstructural integrity. It permits a more detailed
analysis of specific subpopulations of fibres, and indirect
volumetric indices (e.g. number of streamlines and tract
volume), which cannot be measured with TBSS. It has
been applied to a wide range of neurodevelopmental con-
ditions in addition to ASD (Catani et al., 2011), including
psychopathy (Craig et al., 2009; Sethi et al., 2015), dys-
lexia (Vanderauwera et al., 2015), acallosal brain (Forkel
et al., 2014; Be
´ne
´zit et al., 2015) and schizophrenia
(Kanaan et al., 2009; Catani et al., 2011). These studies
suggest that this method of white matter sampling may be
particularly well suited for neurodevelopmental condi-
tions, including ASD, as changes are likely to occur
along the entire course of the fibres, rather than be loca-
lized within circumscribed areas.
In summary, our aim was to understand whether white
matter abnormalities in ASD are diffuse or localized to spe-
cific tracts. We also hypothesized that in adults with ASD
the intensity of the white matter differences would be
linked to the severity of symptoms in social interactions,
repetitive behaviour and communication.
Materials and methods
Participants
Sixty-one male right-handed adults with ASD and 61 matched
neurotypical male controls aged 18 to 45 years were recruited
by advertisement and subsequently assessed at one of two
collaborating autism research centres in the UK that make
up
the
Medical
Research
Council
UK
Autism
Imaging
Multicentre Study (MRC AIMS) Consortium: the Institute of
Psychiatry at Kings College London and the Autism Research
Centre at the University of Cambridge. Equal ratios of cases to
controls
were
recruited
at
each
site:
London,
34:34;
Cambridge, 27:27. Overall intellectual ability was assessed
using
the
Wechsler
Abbreviated
Scale
of
Intelligence
(Wechsler, 1999). All participants fell within the high-function-
ing range on the spectrum defined by a full-scale IQ 4 70. All
participants
with
ASD
were
diagnosed
according
to
International
Statistical
Classification
of
Diseases,
10th
Revision research criteria (ICD10-R) (WHO, 1983), confirmed
using the Autism Diagnostic Interview-Revised (ADI-R) (Lord
et al., 1994). The ADI-R is a semi-structured interview of par-
ents that focuses primarily on the key diagnostic characteristics
specified in the ICD10-R and DSM IV-R (Diagnostic and
Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders); namely those features
concerned with developmental delays, differences in reciprocal
social interactions, language, communication and play, and
restricted and stereotyped behaviours and interests. Many
items concentrate on the age 4 to 5 year period.
All cases of ASD reached ADI-R algorithm cut-off values in
the three domains of autism characteristics (social reciprocity,
communication, repetitive and restricted behaviours and inter-
ests), although failure to reach cut-off in one of the domains
by one point was permitted. Current symptoms were assessed
using the Autism Diagnostic Observation Schedule (ADOS)
(Lord et al., 2000) but were not used as inclusion criteria.
The ADOS is a semi-structured assessment of communication,
social interaction and imaginative use of materials. Module 4
is designed for use with verbally fluent adolescents or adults,
and describes a standardized interview/observational assess-
ment consisting of 9–14 activities with 31 accompanying

In
addition,
Autism-Spectrum

(AQ),
Empathy Quotient (EQ),
and Systemizing Quotient (SQ)
were collected for all patients. The ASD sample included 24
males with an ICD10-R diagnosis of childhood autism and 37
with Asperger syndrome (see Table 1 for details).
Exclusion criteria included a history of psychotic disorders,
head injury, genetic disorder associated with ASD, any medical
condition affecting brain function (e.g. epilepsy), current use of
antipsychotic medication, mood stabilizers, or benzodiazepines
or a history of substance misuse (including alcohol).

MRI data acquisition
At both sites participants were scanned with MRI scanners oper-
ating at 3T (GE Medical Systems HDx). We used the same
scanning acquisition protocol at both sites to ensure data com-
patibility. High-resolution
structural T1-weighted volumetric
images were acquired with full-head coverage, 196 contiguous
slices (1.1 mm thickness, with 1.09 � 1.09 mm in-plane reso-
lution), a 256 � 256 � 196 matrix and a repetition time/echo
time of 7/2.8ms (flip angle 20�, field of view 28cm). An 8-chan-
nel head-coil was used for radiofrequency transmission and re-
ception allowing a parallel imaging (ASSET) speed up factor of
2. Consistent image quality was ensured by a semi-automated
quality control procedure. DT-MRI data were acquired using a
spin-echo echo-planar imaging double refocused sequence pro-
viding whole head coverage with isotropic image resolution
(2.4 � 2.4 � 2.4mm;

using a digital pulse oximeter placed on participants’ forefinger.
Diffusion tensor MRI processing
Diffusion data were processed using ExploreDTI (Leemans
et al., 2009). Data were first preprocessed correcting for
eddy current distortions and head motion. For each subject
the mean rotational and translational relative movement was
extracted and statistical analysis was performed to detect
group differences in head movement. No statistically signifi-
cant differences were found between ASD and controls. For
each subject the b-matrix was then reoriented to provide a
more
accurate
estimate
of
diffusion
tensor
orientations
(Leemans and Jones, 2009). Diffusion tensor was estimated
using a non-linear least square approach (Jones and Basser,
2004). Fractional anisotropy, mean diffusivity and radial

 diffusivity maps were generated. Whole brain tractography
was performed by selecting all seed voxels with fractional an-
isotropy 4 0.2. Streamlines were propagated using an Euler
integration (Basser et al., 2000), and a tractography algorithm
step size of 1 mm. Where fractional anisotropy 5 0.2 or when
the
angle
between
two
consecutive
tractography
steps
was 4 35�, tractography stopped. Finally, diffusion tensor
maps
and
whole
brain
tractography
were
exported
to
Trackvis (Wang et al., 2007) for virtual manual dissection of
the tracts.
Tract-based spatial statistics analysis
Each participant’s fractional anisotropy map was transformed
into standard stereotactic space (using FMRIB58 template) and
a mean fractional anisotropy map for the whole sample used
to create the average core ‘skeleton’. By using only the core of
the sample’s white matter the peripheral tract regions are not
involved in further analysis, thus removing partial volume ef-
fects (Smith et al., 2006). Skeleton images of each participant’s
fractional anisotropy map were then produced and projected
onto the mean skeleton to identify voxels where fractional
anisotropy value differs significantly between these skeletons
using voxel-wise statistics. The design matrix used centre, per-
formance IQ, and age as covariates. Five thousand permuta-
tions were applied (confidence limits for P = 0.05 is � 0.0062).
The TFCE value images are reported fully corrected for mul-
tiple comparisons across space using threshold free cluster en-
hancement with a specified significance level of P 5 0.05.
Tractography dissections
Following the TBSS analysis, white matter regions that were
found to be atypical in ASD were localized using a probabil-
istic digital atlas of the major white matter tracts (Catani and
Thiebaut de Schotten, 2012). Tracts that were identified to be
atypical in ASD by the TBSS analysis were dissected using one
or two region of interest approach (Catani and Thiebaut de
Schotten, 2008). The tractographer was blind to group mem-
bership of each subject and brain side.
We performed virtual dissections of the left and right arcuate
fasciculus and its segments connecting frontal, parietal and tem-
poral regions according to previous publications (Catani et al.,
2005) (Fig. 2). We also performed virtual dissections of the
three major limbic pathways including the cingulum, uncinate
fasciculus and fornix (Catani and Thiebaut de Schotten, 2008).
In addition we dissected the inferior longitudinal fasciculus and
the inferior fronto-occipital fasciculus to extend the analysis to
pathways that contain parts of the fibres connecting limbic
structures to visual and auditory associative areas (Fig. 3).
The corpus callosum was dissected using a single region of inter-
est defined on the two most medial slices of the fractional an-
isotropy maps. Individual portions of the corpus callosum were
analysed separately according to Witelson’s (1989) criteria.
Statistical analysis
Statistical comparisons of the data were performed using SPSS
software (SPSS Inc, Chicago, Ill). Demographic and behav-
ioural differences between ASD and control groups were

ANOVA analyses were performed separately for each meas-
urement (i.e. number of streamlines, volume, fractional anisot-
ropy,
mean
diffusivity,
and
perpendicular
diffusivity)
to
examine group differences (i.e. the fixed factor) for the peri-
sylvian network (long, posterior and anterior segments of the
arcuate fasciculus) and the limbic association pathways (cingu-
lum and uncinate fasciculus). Corpus callosum’s group differ-
ences were estimated separately for each measurement (i.e.
number of streamlines, volume, fractional anisotropy, mean
diffusivity,
and
perpendicular
diffusivity)
using
univariate
ANOVA analyses. Age, centre and performance IQ were
entered as covariates in all analyses. Post hoc comparisons
for specific tracts were considered as statistically significant if
they survived Bonferroni correction for multiple comparisons
(P 5 0.0045, five tracts for each hemisphere; P 5 0.008 for
the corpus callosum). Both streamline count and tract volume
were calculated for each tract. Considering that both measures
yielded to similar results only streamline count is reported. To
study possible associations between tract abnormalities and
symptom severity within the ASD group we related differences
in tracts to symptom severity as measured by the relevant ADI-
R and ADOS scores using Pearson correlation.

Between-groups differences were statistically significant for
the
mean

[F(1 120) = 5.618;
P = 0.020]
and
radial diffusivity [F(1 120), 4.629; P = 0.034]. A statistically
significant Group � Hemisphere interaction for the number
of

[F(2 116) = 6.817;
P = 0.010]
and
Group � Tract interaction for the number of streamlines
[F(2, 113) = 4.045; P = 0.02] was also found.
Post hoc independent sample t-test, Bonferroni corrected
for multiple comparisons, showed that the ASD group had
higher mean and radial diffusivity in the left long and left
anterior segments (Table 2). Differences in the number of
streamlines of the left long and anterior segments and mean
diffusivity of the posterior right segment did not survive
correction for multiple comparisons.
We subsequently explored whether anatomical differ-
ences in the left long and anterior segments of the arcuate
fasciculus were associated with language and communica-
tion impairment. Pearson’s correlations were calculated be-
tween
tract-specific
measurements
and
measures
for
abnormalities in language and communication, that is,
ADI-R (B1-B4 subscores) and ADOS (A subscore) subscores
in the ‘communication’ domain. A statistically significant
negative correlation was found between the number of
streamlines of the left anterior segment and the ADI-R B3
score for stereotyped, repetitive and idiosyncratic speech
(Pearson’s correlation = �0.340; P = 0.005) (Fig. 2B). The
correlation was mainly driven by the severity of stereotyped
utterances and delayed echolalia (Fig. 2C) and impaired re-
ciprocal conversation (Fig. 2D). There were no significant
correlations with the ADOS communication scores.

 Limbic tracts
A statistically significant Group � Hemisphere interaction
for fractional anisotropy [F(2 118) = 6.197; P = 0.014] was
found. No other interactions were found with number of
streamlines, mean diffusivity or radial diffusivity.
Post hoc independent sample t-test, Bonferroni corrected
for multiple comparisons, showed that the ASD group had
significantly higher mean diffusivity and radial diffusivity in
the left uncinate and lower fractional anisotropy in the left
cingulum (Table 3). Differences in the number of stream-
lines and fractional anisotropy of the left uncinate and
radial diffusivity in the left cingulum did not survive cor-
rection for multiple comparisons.
We also explored whether anatomical differences in the
left uncinate fasciculus and cingulum were associated with
impaired social interaction. Pearson’s correlation was cal-
culated between tract-specific measurements and measures
for abnormality in social interaction, that is, ADI-R (A1–

nificant correlation was found between the number of
streamlines of the left uncinate and the ADI-R total score
for qualitative abnormalities in reciprocal social inter-
actions (r = �0.269; P = 0.01), and A4 score for impaired
socio-emotional reciprocity (r = �0.295; P = 0.01) (Fig. 3B).
A similar correlation was found between fractional anisot-
ropy of the left uncinate and the A4 score (r = �0.301;
P 5 0.01). The correlation with A4 score was mainly
driven by the severity of ‘inappropriate use of facial expres-
sion’ (Fig. 3C). Statistically significant differences in the
fractional anisotropy and radial diffusivity of the left un-
cinate fasciculus were also found between ASD participants
who demonstrated delayed use of meaningful single words
(524 months of age) and ASD participants who developed
use of single words within normal developmental ranges
(Fig. 3D and E). There were no correlations between
ADOS subscores and uncinate measurements, or between
scores for impaired socio-emotional reciprocity on the ADI-
R and ADOS and other limbic tracts.
Corpus callosum
There were no statistically significant differences between
participants with ASD and controls in the number of
streamlines, fractional anisotropy, mean diffusivity and
radial diffusivity of the total corpus callosum.

vealed a statistically significant increase in mean diffusivity

Discussion
In this multicentre study we investigated the anatomy of
white matter networks in adults with ASD. We were able
to confirm in a large population that white matter differ-
ences in ASD persist into adult life. White matter differ-
ences in ASD were localized to major association and
commissural tracts of the frontal lobe. These tracts connect
frontal lobe to more posterior areas of the parietal, limbic
and temporal lobe. Further, white matter differences within
particular networks were found to be associated with spe-
cific childhood ASD behavioural characteristics. We found,
for example, differences in the left arcuate fasciculus, which
plays a key role in language and social function (Catani
and Bambini, 2014). Specifically, the number of streamlines
of the left anterior segment of the arcuate fasciculus was
negatively
associated
with
stereotyped
utterances
and
delayed echolalia in childhood (i.e. based on the ADI-R).
Similarly, we found that ASD was associated with diffusion
abnormalities of the left uncinate fasciculus, which plays a
significant role in face encoding and emotional processing
associated with face perception (Papagno et al., 2011).
Further, this correlated with ‘inappropriate use of facial
expression’ in childhood.
Overall, our findings confirm a number of previous stu-
dies that have examined white matter tracts in ASD with
varying approaches to diffusion imaging data (see Ameis
and Catani, 2015 for a recent review). A recent meta-ana-
lysis of diffusion tensor imaging (voxel-based) studies that
provided a collective sample of 330 people with ASD and
313 controls revealed decreases in fractional anisotropy in
white matter voxels containing fibres of the left arcuate
fasciculus, uncinate fasciculus and corpus callosum, and
increases in mean diffusivity in the same regions (Aoki
et al., 2013). The meta-analysis also reported differences
in the inferior longitudinal and inferior fronto-occipital fas-
ciculus, but these did not reach statistical significance. In
addition to voxel-based studies, tractography studies have
also examined white matter tracts linking socio-emotional
and communication regions in ASD. While the uncinate
and arcuate fasciculi have been most frequently implicated
as abnormal in ASD, a smaller number of studies support
the presence of abnormalities in additional tracts, including
the cingulum bundle, the inferior longitudinal and inferior
fronto-occipital fasciculus (Ameis and Catani, 2015). Such
abnormalities are generally reflected by decreased fractional
anisotropy and increased diffusivity, although differences in
the opposite direction have also been reported in children
and adolescents, but less frequently (Cheng et al., 2010;
Shukla et al., 2010). Some studies have also reported
increased
number
of
streamlines
for
the
same
tracts
(Pugliese et al., 2009; Kumar et al., 2010; Thomas et al.,
2011). While small sample size, differences in the severity
of the disorder and in the imaging approaches among stu-
dies can explain some of the contrasting findings (Lazar
et al, 2014; Ameis and Catani, 2015), different diffusion
abnormalities in the same tract in studies sampling ASD
participants of different ages, likely point to an evolving
picture
of
white
matter
pathology
with
development
(Pugliese et al., 2009; Kleinhans et al., 2012).
An unexpected finding was the absence of significant cor-
relations between tract-specific measurements and severity
of clinical symptoms in adulthood as measured by the
ADOS. One possible explanation for this negative finding
is that ADOS scores, although commonly used to support a
diagnosis of ASD, may not be suitable for quantifying the
exact severity of current symptoms, especially in adults. It
is also possible that participants with ASD compensated for
their childhood deficits through observation of other people
and alternative modes of communication. This has been
widely documented for the language deficits by previous
behavioural studies (Eisenmajer et al., 1996; Gilchrist et
al., 2001; Howlin et al., 2003). This may lead to changes
at the functional, or cortical level, but not within the white
matter—leading to a mismatch between white matter
abnormalities and current symptoms severity. Indeed, in a
recent study we showed that in ASD, current and historical
language symptoms were associated with different neuro-
anatomical correlates (Lai et al., 2014). In general there is
limited evidence in the literature of a direct correlation be-
tween white matter abnormalities and clinical symptoms.
The most common finding reported is a direct correlation
between uncinate fasciculus abnormalities and impaired
social cognition. For example, Chen et al. (2011) reported
a negative correlation between white matter indices and
social
deficits
in
ASD,
where
increased
Social
Responsiveness Scale scores correlated with reduced frac-
tional anisotropy in right uncinate fasciculus. Similarly
Kumar et al. (2010) used tractography to show that macro-
structural alterations within the uncinate fasciculus in ASD
were correlated with the severity of symptoms, including
socio-emotional deficits, on the Gilliam Autism Rating
Scale. One interesting study that used DTI after a commu-
nication intervention in 22 low functioning young males
with ASD found a positive correlation of uncinate fascic-
ulus fractional anisotropy with both therapy duration and
symptom improvement measured using the Child Autism
Rating Scale (Pardini et al., 2012). While all of these find-
ings suggest that ASD is characterized by differences in
white matter tracts, the exact biological mechanism modu-
lating these differences cannot be elucidated by diffusion
techniques but may be understood by other methodologies,
including post-mortem studies.
Post-mortem studies have reported that ASD is associated
with white matter inflammation and reduced neural size
and increased packing density within frontal and temporal

 limbic (grey matter) structures (Bailey et al., 1998; Bauman
and Kemper, 2005; Vargas et al., 2005). Further, compared
to controls, ASD is associated with increased number of
neuronal processing units, known as cortical mini-columns
(Mountcastle, 1997), within frontal and temporal cortices
(Casanova et al., 2002a, b). Mini-columns are highly inter-
connected, and a greater number of mini-columns could
result in increased formation of short-range (intracortical)
connections and disrupted maturation of long-range con-
nections linking distant regions (Casanova et al., 2002a,
b). These findings may be of particular relevance to our
study
as
they
suggest
ASD
pathology
induces
white
matter changes in the long white matter connections pos-
sibly related to axons with larger diameter, reduced mye-
lination, or increased oedema due to inflammation (Vargas
et al., 2005). This interpretation could explain the findings
of reduced fractional anisotropy and increased radial diffu-
sivity in the long-range connections of the frontal lobe in
the current study. This hypothesis is also supported by a
recent post-mortem study in ASD, which reported reduced
myelin thickness in the frontal white matter (Zikopoulos
and Barbas, 2010).
It remains unclear, however, whether these changes
follow an initial failure of connections to establish correct
organization, or a later weakening of successfully formed
white matter connections (Geschwind and Levitt, 2007) as
the majority of ASD individuals studied in post-mortem
analyses are older children and adults (Courchesne et al.,
2007). Therefore, to determine how, and when, these pu-
tative changes commence future studies would benefit from
including a younger cohort. A recent in vivo longitudinal
study has highlighted the need for this (Wolff et al., 2012).
In this study high-risk infants who later developed ASD
were found to have reduced fractional anisotropy in
limbic and association tracts including those reported in
our current study, by the age they showed obvious signs
of autism. This study also suggested that white matter dif-
ferences are evident as early as 6 months of age in infants
at risk of ASD, although abnormalities were in the opposite
direction (i.e. increased fractional anisotropy in the at risk
group). The initial increased fractional anisotropy could
have been related to increased myelination, and/or smaller
axonal diameter, in infants at risk of ASD. These findings
suggest that ASD progresses through different stages during
early
neurodevelopment
(i.e.
overgrowth
followed
by
blunted development). Realistically, it is difficult to validate
these findings using post-mortem studies due to limited
availability of donated brains from infants. However, the
application of complimentary in vivo neuroimaging meth-
ods could assist in the interpretation of diffusion tensor
imaging results.
Our findings also indicate an asymmetry of abnormalities
with greater differences in the white matter of the left hemi-
sphere in the ASD compared to controls. Previous diffusion
studies have demonstrated that maturation of left white
matter pathways in the temporal and frontal lobe is corre-
lated with development of specific cognitive functions
(Nagy et al., 2004). Loss of normal interhemispheric asym-
metry, both at the cortical and subcortical level, is one of
the most replicated findings in ASD (Herbert et al., 2005;
Radua et al., 2011; Ameis and Catani, 2015). This indi-
cates that in general the underlying pathological process is
rather asymmetrical in ASD and specific to those networks
that show the greatest degree of lateralization in the neu-
rotypically developing brain.
Finally, the differences in tract-specific measurements be-
tween neurotypical adults and ASD were particularly sig-
nificant for the mean diffusivity and radial diffusivity in our
tractography analysis. This finding suggests that, compared
to fractional anisotropy and tract volume, mean diffusivity
and radial diffusivity have greater intrinsic sensitivity to
in vivo abnormalities associated with ASD pathology but
also that the biophysical meaning of these indices is differ-
ent. Since fractional anisotropy is a measure of anisotropy,
it is by definition a ‘relative’ index that quantifies the dif-
ference of diffusivities of the three eigenvalues. This makes
this index sensitive to changes in the overall structural or-
ganization of the tissue or the fibre architecture but it does
not give information on how much faster or slower is dif-
fusion in different directions. Conversely, mean diffusivity
and radial diffusivity are absolute measures that directly
provide a quantitative measure of water mobility within
the tissue, either as average to the voxel (mean diffusivity)
or radially to the direction of maximum diffusivity (radial
diffusivity). Therefore mean diffusivity and radial diffusivity
could be more specific and better related to abnormalities,
such as changes in axonal membrane, extra-axonal vol-
ume density or in the myelin sheet because they may cap-
ture something not visible in a ratio or a difference in
diffusivities. In support of our findings, a recent study
also reported differences between typically developing ado-
lescents and individuals with ASD only for diffusivity mea-
sures (Lisiecka et al., 2015).
While the present study has several advantages compared
to previous ones, its limitations include a cross-sectional
design and exclusion of children, females and participants
with intellectual disability, which limit our capability for
generalization or confirming causal and temporal develop-
mental effects. These criteria were implemented in order to
optimize sample homogeneity. There is, for example, sex
difference in arcuate tract development in the typically de-
veloping population (Catani et al., 2007). Therefore our
results may not generalize to females with ASD, suggesting
the need for future studies to include comparable samples
of females. Similarly, the exclusion of individuals with
below average IQ may mean that our results are not gen-
eralizable to the proportion of those with both ASD and
intellectual disability. It could be argued that the significant
difference in the performance IQ between the two groups
may have confounded our findings. However, this differ-
ence was dealt with by co-varying for this across all of our
analyses. A multicentre design was used for MRI data ac-
quisition, which may carry additional limitations. However,

 parameters across scanning sites. In addition intersite ef-
fects were accounted for in the statistical model (Suckling
et al., 2010, 2012). Therefore, the detected between-group
differences cannot be fully explained by these limitations.
Finally, some of the negative findings (e.g. lack of correla-
tion between anatomy of the corpus callosum and ASD
symptoms) could be explained by the use of the tensor
method,
which
is
limited
in
resolving
fibre
crossing.
Future studies are necessary to improve the complete visua-
lization of callosal tracts using advanced diffusion models
(Dell’Acqua et al., 2013).
In conclusion, our results suggest that male adults with
ASD have regional differences in brain anatomy, which
persist in adult life and correlate with specific aspects of
autistic symptoms in childhood . We also found that ASD
was associated with specific structural abnormalities of
white
matter
fibres,
compatible
with
the
concept
of
autism being associated with atypical developmental con-
nectivity of the frontal lobes. Future studies are needed to
confirm our findings and to extend them across a wider
range of autistic spectrum conditions.
