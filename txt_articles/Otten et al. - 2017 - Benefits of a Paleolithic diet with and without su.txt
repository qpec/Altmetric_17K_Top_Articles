Abstract
Background
Means to reduce future risk for cardiovascular disease in subjects
with type 2 diabetes are urgently needed.
Methods
Thirty-two patients with type 2 diabetes (age 59± 8 years) followed
a Paleolithic diet for 12 weeks. Participants were randomized to either standard
care exercise recommendations (PD) or 1-h supervised exercise sessions (aerobic
exercise and resistance training) three times per week (PD-EX).
Results
For the within group analyses, fat mass decreased by 5.7 kg (IQR: �6.6,
�4.1; p< 0.001) in the PD group and by 6.7 kg (�8.2, �5.3; p< 0.001) in the PD-
EX group. Insulin sensitivity (HOMA-IR) improved by 45% in the PD (p< 0.001)
and PD-EX (p< 0.001) groups. HbA1c decreased by 0.9% (�1.2, �0.6; p< 0.001)
in the PD group and 1.1% (�1.7, �0.7; p< 0.01) in the PD-EX group. Leptin
decreased by 62% (p< 0.001) in the PD group and 42% (p< 0.001) in the
PD-EX group. Maximum oxygen uptake increased by 0.2 L/min (0.0, 0.3) in the
PD-EX group, and remained unchanged in the PD group (p< 0.01 for the differ-
ence between intervention groups). Male participants decreased lean mass by
2.6 kg (�3.6, �1.3) in the PD group and by 1.2 kg (�1.3, 1.0) in the PD-EX group
(p< 0.05 for the difference between intervention groups).
Conclusions
A Paleolithic diet improves fat mass and metabolic balance in-
cluding insulin sensitivity, glycemic control, and leptin in subjects with type
2 diabetes. Supervised exercise training may not enhance the effects on these
outcomes, but preserves lean mass in men and increases cardiovascular fitness.

 risk factors, such as hyperglycemia, high blood pressure,
and dyslipidemia through diet, exercise, and drug treatment
[2]. Earlier studies suggested a Paleolithic diet had powerful
beneficial metabolic effects on obesity, as well as in type 2
diabetes [3,4]. This diet emphasizes a high intake of vegeta-
bles, fruit, nuts, eggs, fish, and lean meat, while excluding
refined sugar, salt, legumes, dairy products, and grains.
Additional metabolic effects beyond diet may be
achieved with structured exercise interventions [5,6].
The combination of diet interventions with energy restric-
tions and resistance training or aerobic exercise is benefi-
cial for body composition in non-diabetic subjects [7]. In
subjects with type 2 diabetes, the combination of aerobic
exercise with resistance training lowers HbA1c levels more
than either exercise modality separately [8]. To the best of
our knowledge, studies on Paleolithic diet combined with
resistance training and aerobic exercise have not been per-
formed in subjects with type 2 diabetes.
In the present study, subjects with type 2 diabetes con-
sumed a Paleolithic diet for 12 weeks, with or without super-
vised aerobic exercise and resistance training. Our hypothesis
was that exercise training would improve the beneficial ef-
fects of a Paleolithic diet on fat mass and metabolic balance
including insulin sensitivity, glycemic control, and leptin.
Materials and methods
Study design
We conducted a randomized controlled trial with two
arms: Paleolithic diet and standard care exercise recom-
mendations (PD) and Paleolithic diet with 1-h supervised
exercise sessions three times per week (PD-EX). In a sec-
ondary analysis, we included a non-randomized observa-
tional group as a reference.
Participants of the randomized
controlled trial
Subjects were recruited from the greater Umeå area of
Northern Sweden through advertisements in local newspa-
pers and posters at Umeå University Hospital. Recruitment
began in 2012, and the study was completed in June
2014. We included individuals diagnosed with type 2 diabe-
tes within the past 10 years, who had a BMI of 25–40 kg/m2
and were weight stable (i.e. <5% weight loss) for 6 months
before study inclusion. Eligible males were 30–70 years old,
while women were included after menopause and up to
70 years of age. All participants had HbA1c values between
6.5% and 10.8% (47–94 mmol/mol), and were using life-
style
modification
and/or
metformin
for
diabetes
treatment. Exclusion criteria were treatment with anti-
diabetic drugs other than metformin, use of beta-blockers,
blood
pressure> 160/100
mmHg,
macroalbuminuria,
heart disease, and being a smoker. Because we aimed to
study the effect of exercise on sedentary individuals, we ex-
cluded those who reported more than 30 min of moderate
physical activity 5 days per week or resistance training more
than once every other week during the past 6 months. Of
261 volunteers who were interested in participating, 32
met the inclusion criteria and were randomized into the
PD or PD-EX groups (Figure 1). All participants provided
written informed consent. The study protocol was in accord
with the Helsinki declaration, and was approved by the Re-
gional Ethical Review Board, Umeå, Sweden.
Randomization and blinding
Participants were assigned to the PD and PD-EX groups
using biassed coin minimization with an allocation ratio
of 1:1 [9]. To minimize marginal imbalance based on
the prognostic factors (sex and BMI above/below 30), par-
ticipants were sequentially allocated using a base proba-
bility of 0.9. The computer program MinimPy was used
for treatment allocation [10]. Randomization was con-
ducted after the baseline examinations. The study was
single-blinded, such that group allocation was unknown
to all staff that performed examinations and dietary
counselling. Additionally, the statistician who randomized
the participants and the research assistant who informed
the participants of the randomization outcome were not
involved in data collection or data analysis. The study
was unblinded after the analysis of results.
Diet intervention
Both randomized groups (PD and PD-EX) were intro-
duced to the Paleolithic diet after baseline examinations,
and were instructed to follow the diet until all study mea-
surements were completed. The diet was based on con-
suming lean meat, fish, seafood, eggs, vegetables, fruits,
berries, and nuts. Cereals, dairy products, legumes, re-
fined fats, refined sugars, and salt were excluded with
the exception of canned fish and cold cuts like ham. The
diet was consumed ad libitum, with restrictions of the fol-
lowing: eggs (1–2/day but a maximum of 5/week), pota-
toes (1 medium sized/day), dried fruit (130 g/day), and
nuts (60 g/day). Rapeseed or olive oil (maximum
15 g/day) and small amounts of honey and vinegar were
allowed as flavouring in cooking. Participants were
instructed to drink mainly still water. Coffee and tea were
restricted to a maximum of 300 g/day, and red wine to a
maximum of one glass/week.

 Each group participated separately in five group ses-
sions held by a trained dietician at the Department of
Food and Nutrition, Umeå University, Sweden. The first
two meetings were held during the first 2 weeks, and
the following meetings took place once a month. The par-
ticipants received information about the diet and cooked
food and were given recipes. Between the meetings, the
participants could contact the dietician, who held the
meetings by e-mail or phone.
Exercise intervention
Prior to randomization, both intervention groups received
exercise recommendations based on the current guidelines
for patients with type 2 diabetes. Thus, all study partici-
pants were advised to perform moderate exercise (e.g. brisk
walking) for at least 30 min every day. The PD-EX group
underwent a program comprising a combination of aerobic
exercise and resistance training in 1-h sessions three times
weekly at the Sports Medicine unit at Umeå University.
The exercise sessions were performed on weekdays, with
at least 1 day of rest between sessions. They were super-
vised by experienced personal trainers with bachelor’s de-
grees in Sports Medicine. The training protocol had a
progressive design in accord with the guidelines of the
American College of Sports Medicine [11].
All exercise sessions started with aerobic exercise. The
first session of each week consisted of low-intensity aerobic
training at 70% of the maximum heart rate on a cross-
trainer (Monark Prime, XT 50, Vansbro, Sweden). The
second session of the week consisted of ten high-intensity
sprint intervals at 100% of the maximal workload on a
cycle-ergometer (Monark, Ergomedic 839E, Vansbro, Swe-
den), with low-intensity cycling between the sprints. The
third session of each week comprised six moderate-intensity
5-min intervals between 45 and 60% of maximal workload
on a cycle-ergometer. The duration/workload of the inter-
vals increased every other week. When necessary, the inten-
sity of the aerobic exercise sessions was adjusted in accord
with the participant’s performance.
After the aerobic exercise, the sessions progressed to re-
sistance training with both upper and lower body exer-
cises, including leg presses, seated leg extensions, leg
curls, hip raises, flat and incline bench presses, seated
rows, dumbbell rows, lat pull-downs, shoulder raises,
back extensions, burpees, sit-ups, step-ups, and wall ball
shots. At each training session, the participant performed
three to five of the aforementioned resistance exercises,
with 10–15 repetitions and two to four sets. Once partici-
pants could complete all repetitions, the workload was in-
creased for the following session.
Measurements
At baseline and at 12 weeks, dietary intake was assessed
using a 4-day self-reported weighed food record. Each

 4-day food record period included one or two weekend
days. Participants were instructed to weigh all food,
beverages, and leftovers. Any uncertainties regarding the
food records were clarified during meetings, via e-mail,
or by phone. A trained dietician converted the reported
food intake into estimated energy and nutrient intake
using the nutritional analysis software Dietist XP version
3.2 (Kost och Näringsdata AB, Bromma, Sweden), based
on the Swedish National Food Administration’s food
database.
Participants
were examined
at baseline
and
after
12 weeks of the intervention by experienced physicians
and nurses at the Clinical Research Center at Umeå Univer-
sity Hospital, Umeå, Sweden. Resting energy expenditure
was measured using indirect calorimetry (Datex-Ohmeda
Deltatrac II; Datex-Ohmeda Inc., Madison, WI, USA) and
adjusted by subtracting 5% during 8 h of sleep. Daily physi-
cal activity energy expenditure over a 7-day period was
estimated using data from a combined accelerometer and
heart
rate
monitor
(Actiheart®;
CamNtech
Ltd.,
Cambridge, UK) [12], modelled as described previously
[13–15]. Diet-induced thermogenesis was fixed at 10% of
the total energy expenditure. Total energy expenditure
was calculated as the sum of the resting energy expenditure
and physical activity expenditure plus 10%.
Fat mass (i.e. the primary outcome) and lean mass
were analysed by dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry
(Lunar Prodigy X-ray Tube Housing Assembly, Brand
BX-1 L, Model 8743; GE Medical Systems, Madison, WI,
USA). The participants were weighed on a digital cali-
brated scale, wearing light clothing. Height was measured
with a calibrated height-measuring gauge. Waist circum-
ference was assessed with a measuring tape placed
midway between the lowest rib and iliac crest during
gentle exhalation. The abdomen height was measured at
the umbilicus level with the participant lying down with
straight legs.
An automated blood pressure meter (Boso Medicus,
Bosch, Germany) was used to measure systolic and diastolic
blood pressure from the right arm with the participant in a
sitting position. Measurements were made twice at 2-min
intervals, after 5 min of rest. Fasting venous blood samples
were collected from patients in the intervention groups for
analysis of HbA1c, serum insulin, serum cholesterol, high
density lipoprotein (HDL), serum triglycerides, and plasma
high-sensitivity C-reactive protein at the Department for
Clinical Chemistry, Umeå University Hospital. We analysed
fasting glucose from a capillary sample (HemoCue 201 RT;
Radiometer Medical Aps, Brønshøj, Denmark). Aliquots of
plasma were immediately stored at �80 °C for analysis of
non-esterified fatty acids (NEFAs), adiponectin, and leptin
after study completion. The NEFAs were analysed with
NEFA-HR2
(Wako
Chemicals,
Neuss,
Germany),
adiponectin with the Human Adiponectin ELISA Kit, and
leptin with the Human Leptin ELISA Kit, both from Merck
Millipore (Darmstadt, Germany). Insulin sensitivity was
calculated as follows: homeostatic model assessment of
insulin resistance (HOMA-IR)= (fasting glucose× fasting
insulin)/ 22.5 and the revised quantitative insulin sensitiv-
ity check index (Revised QUICKI)= 1/ (log fasting glucose
+ log fasting insulin+ log NEFA) [16,17]. The low density
lipoprotein (LDL) was calculated as follows: (serum
cholesterol� serum HDL� serum triglycerides)/ 2.2. The
maximal oxygen uptake (VO2max) and maximal workload
were measured via cardiopulmonary exercise test at the De-
partment of Clinical Physiology, Umeå University Hospital,
Umeå, Sweden.
Observational group
For a secondary analysis, we recruited an observational
group by advertisement in local newspapers and among
those who were excluded from the intervention because
of a lack of time, beta-blocker use, and cardiovascular
disease. Nine individuals were included in the observa-
tional group, one of whom could not attend the assess-
ments at the end of the intervention period because of
illness. Fasting glucose, fasting insulin, HbA1c, leptin,
adiponectin, and blood lipids were analysed from venous
blood samples. Body composition, weight, blood pressure,
dietary intake, and physical activity energy expenditure
were examined as described above.
Sample size and statistical analysis
The primary outcome in this study was the change in fat
mass. Based on previous results from a similar study
[18], we calculated that 13 individuals in each interven-
tion group would be sufficient to detect a significant
difference (p < 0.05) with 80% power. Because several
variables had a skewed distribution, the Wilcoxon rank-
sum test was used to compare groups. All data were
reported as medians with the interquartile range. The pri-
mary analysis compared treatment effects (change from 0
to 12 weeks) between the PD and PD-EX groups. The
change over time within each intervention group was
determined using the Wilcoxon signed-rank test. The sec-
ondary analysis compared the treatment effect (change
from 0 to 12 weeks) in each intervention group with the
observational group. A two-sided p value of <0.05 was
considered statistically significant. All statistical analyses
were performed using R version 3.1.1, a language and
environment for statistical computing (R Foundation for
Statistical Computing, Vienna, Austria).

 Results
Subject characteristics
The participants’ baseline characteristics are presented in
Tables 1 and 2. The randomized groups did not differ in
age, sex, BMI, or diabetes duration. The PD-EX group
had higher fasting glucose and HDL levels than the PD
group. During the course of the study, one participant in
the PD group stopped his metformin treatment, two par-
ticipants in the PD group stopped their blood pressure
medication, and one participant in the PD group started
antihypertensive treatment.
Compliance with the diet and
supervised exercise program
Dietary intake did not differ between the groups at base-
line and 12 weeks, except for a higher fibre intake in the
PD-group at 12 weeks (Table 3). Both groups increased
their relative intake of protein and their intake of mono-
unsaturated and polyunsaturated fatty acids. Both groups
lowered their intake of carbohydrates and saturated fatty
acids. The reduction of sodium intake was only significant
in the PD-EX group. Nine of the 14 participants in the PD-
EX group completed the 36 exercise sessions according to
the study protocol. The remaining five participants com-
pleted between 27 and 35 workouts during the study pe-
riod. The participants in the PD-EX group increased the
cumulative weight load (weight × repetitions × sets) with
the leg press during one exercise session from 1350 kg
(900–1800) to 3000 kg (2700–4000) after 12 weeks.
Energy balance
At baseline, energy intake (kcal/day) and total energy ex-
penditure (kcal/day) did not differ between groups
(Table 2). Baseline energy intake in the PD group was
1112 kcal/day (�1434, �609) less than the total energy
expenditure. In the PD-EX group, baseline energy intake
was 1340 kcal/day (�1909, �778) less than the total en-
ergy expenditure. Energy intake decreased in both groups
during the intervention (Table 2). Furthermore, total en-
ergy expenditure decreased in the PD group (p < 0.05),
but
remained
stable
in
the
PD-EX-group
(p = 0.17,
Table 2). This was caused by a decrease in the resting en-
ergy expenditure, while the physical activity energy ex-
penditure was unchanged. At the end of the study, the
PD
group
reported
an
energy
intake
that
was
1245 kcal/day (�1480, �905) less than the total energy
expenditure; while, the energy intake of the PD-EX group
was 1657 kcal/day (�2533, �881) less than total energy
expenditure.
Body composition
Fat mass decreased during the study in both the PD and
PD-EX groups (Figure 2). Both groups also showed de-
creases in body weight, abdominal height, and waist cir-
cumference, without differences between intervention
groups (Table 2). Male participants decreased their waist
circumference more in the PD-group compared to the PD-
EX group (p < 0.05, Supplementary Table S2). Males in
the PD-EX group retained more lean mass than males in
the PD-group (p < 0.05, Supplementary Table S2).
Glucose metabolism
Insulin sensitivity and glycemic control improved in both
groups,
without
a
difference
between
groups.
The
HOMA-IR and revised QUICKI improved in both interven-
tion groups (Figure 2, Table 2), and the HbA1c decreased
during the study in both the PD group (19%) and the PD-
EX group (20%, Table 2).
Cardiovascular fitness
Resting heart rate decreased more in the PD-EX group
than the PD group (Table 2). The VO2max and the ergom-
eter cycling workload increased during the study in the
PD-EX group, but not in the PD group (Figure 2).

 Blood pressure and blood lipids
Blood pressure decreased during the study in both interven-
tion groups without any group difference: systolic, 13% in
PD and 8% in PD-EX; diastolic, 10% in PD and 12% in PD-
EX (Table 2). Triglycerides decreased in both study groups
between baseline and 12 weeks; while, the HDL, LDL, and
NEFA levels remained unchanged throughout the interven-
tion (Table 2).
Adipokines
Leptin decreased in both the PD group (62%) and the PD-
EX group (42%) (Table 2). Adiponectin increased in the
PD group (8%) compared with the PD-EX group (Table 2).
Intervention groups (PD and PD-EX)
versus the observational group
There were no significant differences in baseline characteris-
tics between the observational group and the PD and PD-EX
intervention groups (Supplementary Table S1). Compared
with the observational group, the PD and PD-EX groups de-
creased their total energy intakes and intakes of carbohy-
drates and saturated fatty acids, but increased their relative
intake of protein and monounsaturated fatty acids during
the 12 weeks of intervention (Supplementary Tables S2
and S3). The intervention groups improved fat mass
(p< 0.001), HOMA-IR, fasting insulin, HbA1c, systolic and
diastolic blood pressure, and leptin compared with the obser-
vational group (Supplementary Table S2). Triglycerides did
not decrease in the intervention group compared with the
observational group (Supplementary Table S2).
Discussion
Twelve weeks on a Paleolithic diet improved fat mass and
metabolic balance including insulin sensitivity, glycemic
control and leptin among individuals with type 2 diabetes.
The addition of resistance training and aerobic exercise un-
der observation increased cardiovascular fitness, without
further improvements in fat mass or glycemic control. The
observed effects of the Paleolithic diet were substantial.
The lowering of HbA1c by 0.9% units was an effect size sim-
ilar to that reported with metformin in type 2 diabetes [19].
A previous study demonstrated that the Paleolithic diet re-
duced HbA1c by 0.4% units more than a conventional diabe-
tes diet [4]. The UK prospective diabetes study stated that a
1% unit improvement of HbA1c reduces microvascular com-
plications by 37% and reduces diabetes-related death by
21% [20]. Thus, if sustained over time, the improvement

 in glycemic control will provide large benefits in terms of
morbidity and mortality.
These powerful observed effects of the Paleolithic diet
may be explained by altered dietary patterns. The partici-
pants reported reduced intakes of carbohydrates and satu-
rated fatty acids, with relatively higher intakes of protein,
as well as monounsaturated and polyunsaturated fatty
acids. The reduction of carbohydrates with a high glycemic
index may be an important part of the beneficial effects of
this diet [21]. Furthermore, increased intake of monounsat-
urated fat may reduce postprandial hyperglycemia [22].
Supervised training with aerobic exercise in combina-
tion with resistance training did not improve glycemic
control and insulin sensitivity beyond the improvements
observed with the Paleolithic diet alone. This was unex-
pected, as exercise training has previously been shown
to improve glycemic control substantially, particularly
when combining resistance training with aerobic exercise
for more than 150 min per week [6,23,24]. Among indi-
viduals with type 2 diabetes, structured exercise interven-
tions reduce HbA1c levels by about 0.6% units without
weight changes [6]. In contrast, the addition of resistance
or aerobic exercise to short-term (16 weeks) dietary inter-
ventions with a calorie-restricted high-protein diet or a
very low-calorie diet had limited additive effects on insu-
lin sensitivity and glycemic control in patients with type
2 diabetes [18,25]. Notably, our diet recommendations
were given ad libitum without any restrictions of caloric
intake. However, it is possible that the catabolic state
caused by decreased energy intake may have masked
any potential effects of exercise on glycemic control and
insulin sensitivity. Moreover, several study participants
were using metformin or statins on a daily basis. These
drugs may blunt the positive effects of exercise [26–28].
Importantly, cardiovascular fitness improved signifi-
cantly in the PD-EX group compared with the PD group.
Low cardiorespiratory fitness is a strong risk factor for
all-cause mortality, independent of glycemic status and
other cardiovascular risk factors [29,30]. A large cohort
study showed that an increase of 1.44 mL/kg/min in
VO2max (equivalent to a 1-min increase in the Balke pro-
tocol treadmill time) corresponded to a 7.9% reduction in
overall mortality [31]. Using these data, the presently ob-
served increase of 3.3 mL/kg/min in VO2max would lead
to an 18% reduction in all-cause mortality if changes can
be sustained over time. Furthermore, it is of major interest
to study if tissue-specific insulin sensitivity is influenced
differently between groups. We demonstrated earlier that
weight reduction by a Paleolithic diet had a profound
effect on liver insulin sensitivity, while peripheral insulin
sensitivity was unaltered [32]. The exercise intervention
would
be
expected
to
add
an
increased
muscular
(peripheral) sensitivity. This is of interest because insulin
resistance in skeletal muscle can play a key role in the de-
velopment of metabolic complications in obesity-related
disorders, including type 2 diabetes [33].
The combination of aerobic and resistance training is
known to preserve or even increase lean mass during diet
intervention [34]. In our study male participants in the
PD-EX group lost less lean mass compared to males in
the PD group. This difference was not significant if men

 and women were analysed together. Notably, a recent
study showed that 12 weeks of exercise increased lean
mass in obese males, but not in women [35].
In line with earlier studies, another beneficial effect of
the Paleolithic diet is a major reduction in blood pressure
[3,4,32]. The combination of weight reduction and re-
duced sodium intake may be important for this effect.
The reduced triglyceride levels, in both study groups, are
also consistent with earlier studies. Previous studies
showed that a Paleolithic diet decreased triglycerides even
more than a consensus diet [3,4], but exercise under su-
pervision did not significantly improved blood lipids [6].
Leptin levels decreased 62% in the PD group and 42% in
the PD-EX group. Compared to other diet interventions this
is a powerful reduction relative to the weight loss of 7.1 kg
[36,37]. This is in line with a study of individuals with is-
chemic heart disease where a Paleolithic diet for 12 weeks
reduced leptin more relative to the amount of weight loss
than a Mediterranean-like diet [38]. These beneficial ef-
fects on leptin levels are of major importance because
hyperleptinemia increases inflammation [39,40] and is an
independent risk factor for cardiovascular events [41–43].
The increased adiponectin levels in the PD group may
relate to weight loss, with increased protein intake as a
contributing factor [44,45]. The unaltered hormone
levels in the PD-EX group may indicate the increased
plasma volume because of physical activity [46].
In
a
secondary
analysis,
we
compared
the
non-
randomized observational group with the intervention
groups. The intervention groups improved their anthropo-
metric status and metabolic balance versus the observa-
tional group, except for triglycerides, which improved in
the observational group. Notably, the observational group
was not randomized and therefore, we cannot guarantee
equal distribution of confounding factors between the inter-
vention groups and the observational group. Furthermore,
some participants in the observational group suffered from
cardiovascular disease, used beta-blockers, and did not
have the time to participate in the interventions.
A strength of the present study is that energy intake was
validated with objectively measured total energy expendi-
ture. Differences between reported energy intake and mea-
sured total energy expenditure at baseline might be because
of undereating, underreporting, overestimation of physical
activity energy expenditure, and/or increased physical ac-
tivity during the measurement period. Participants may
have started changing their dietary intake and physical ac-
tivity during the baseline-measuring period, even though
they were not introduced to the intervention part of the
study until baseline measurements were finished. Despite

 the validation of energy intake, it is a weakness of the study
that it is not known to what degree the participants actually
followed the Paleolithic diet.
Based on our results, we conclude that the Paleolithic diet
is a powerful tool to improve fat mass and metabolic balance
including insulin sensitivity, glycemic control, and leptin in
individuals with type 2 diabetes. Supervised exercise train-
ing did not provide additional effects on these outcomes,
but preserved lean mass in men and increased cardiovascu-
lar fitness. Detailed analyses of tissue-specific effects of
these interventions, including putative effects on hepatic
versus muscle insulin sensitivity, are of further interest.
