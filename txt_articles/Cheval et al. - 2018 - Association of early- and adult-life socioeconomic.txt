Abstract
Background: socioeconomic circumstances (SEC) during a person’s lifespan influence a wide range of health outcomes.
However, solid evidence of the association of early- and adult-life SEC with health trajectories in ageing is still lacking. This
study assessed whether early-life SEC are associated with muscle strength in later life—a biomarker of health—and whether
this relationship is caused by adult-life SEC and health behaviours.
Methods: we used data from the Survey of Health Ageing and Retirement in Europe, a 12-year population-based cohort
study with repeated measurement in six waves (2004–15) and retrospective collection of life-course data. Participants’ grip
strength was assessed by using a handheld dynamometer. Confounder-adjusted logistic mixed-effect models were used to
examine the associations of early- and adult-life SEC with the risk of low muscle strength (LMS) in older age.
Results: a total of 24,179 participants (96,375 observations) aged 50–96 living in 14 European countries were included in
the analyses. Risk of LMS was increased with disadvantaged relative to advantaged early-life SEC. The association between
risk of LMS and disadvantaged early-life SEC gradually decreased when adjusting for adult-life SEC for both sexes and with
unhealthy behaviours for women. After adjusting for these factors, all associations between risk of LMS and early-life SEC
remained significant for women.
Conclusion: early-life SEC are associated with muscle strength after adjusting for adult-life SEC and behavioural lifestyle
factors, especially in women, which suggests that early life may represent a sensitive period for future health.

 Introduction
Socioeconomic circumstances (SEC) over a person’s life-
span are associated with health risk factors [1, 2], morbidity
[3, 4] and mortality [1, 2, 5]. However, how these SEC
explain health differences is unclear. Early-life SEC are
thought to influence adult health through three intertwined
pathways: (i) socioeconomic and psychological; (ii) health
behaviours; and (iii) biological via a cumulative physiological
wear-and-tear in response to chronic stress (e.g. the inflamma-
tory system) [6]. However, previous studies relied on cross-
sectional and/or short follow-up designs [7–9], which may
have prevented effects related to chronological ageing and
birth cohorts from being disentangled [10, 11]. Thus, evidence
on the relationhsips between life-course SEC and the decline
in health with ageing is relatively weak. Moreover, studies have
generally used crude assessments of early-life SEC (i.e. based
on a limited number of indicators) [12, 13], which may bias
the estimated associations between early-life SEC and health
indicators. As a result, solid evidence on the associations of
early- and adult-life SEC with health in later life is still lacking.
Therefore, based on a 12-year European large cohort
study, the present large-scale and longitudinal study investi-
gated whether individuals who experienced disadvantaged
early-life SEC show a higher risk of low muscle strength
(LMS) in later life, an accurate biomarker of health [14], and
whether adult-life SEC and health behaviours explained this
association. Muscle strength declines in middle-aged and old-
er adults [14, 15] and has been associated with a wide range
of adverse health outcomes such as future disability [16, 17],
morbidity [17, 18] and mortality [19, 20]. In addition, LMS is
associated with inflammatory biomarkers [21], which are
thought to underlie the mechanisms linking the social and
biological pathways. We hypothesised that disadvantaged
early-life SEC are associated with higher risk of LMS in older
age and with a higher increased risk of LMS with ageing. We
also hypothesised that the relationships between early-life
SEC and LMS are partially due to adult-life SEC and
unhealthy behaviours. We hypothesised a partial, but not full,
explanation, because early-life SEC should also have a direct
association with muscle strength as highlighted by the inter-
related pathways described above.
Methods
Study design and participants
Data from individuals aged 50 years and over included in
SHARE were used [22]. SHARE comprises six waves of
data collected every 2 years between 2004 and 2016.
During the third wave, retrospective life-course data related
to early- and adult-life SEC were collected. We included
data for participants aged 50–96 years who took part in the
third wave and performed at least one grip strength meas-
ure. SHARE was approved by the relevant research ethics
committees in the participating countries, and all partici-
pants provided written informed consent.
Measures
Early-life SEC
Early-life SEC were determined according to the Wahrendorf
and Blane [23] measure of childhood circumstances. This meas-
ure was constructed as an index combining four binary indica-
tors of adverse SEC at age 10, which were (i) the occupational
position of the main breadwinner; (ii) the number of books
at home; (iii) a measure of overcrowding; and (iv) housing
quality. By combining the information for these four indica-
tors, we computed a five-level categorical variable of ‘most
advantaged’, ‘advantaged’, ‘middle’, ‘disadvantaged’ and ‘most
disadvantaged.’
Prior confounders
All analyses were adjusted for potential confounders: (i) birth
cohort; (ii) welfare regimes of the country of residence; (iii)
living with biological parents; and (iv) participant attrition.
Mediators
Adult-life SEC. A participant’s highest educational attainment,
main occupational position during adult life, and satisfaction
with household income were added as potential mediators.
Unhealthy behaviour index.
This index was constructed based
on four binary indicators of key unhealthy behaviours, which
were (i) physical inactivity; (ii) unhealthy eating; (iii) smoking;
and (iv) alcohol consumption. By averaging the information
for these four indicators, we computed a continuous variable
ranging from 0, none of these four health-detrimental beha-
viours, to 1, all of these four health-detrimental behaviours.
Outcome
Muscle strength was determined using grip strength, which
was measured with a handheld dynamometer (Smedley, S
Dynamometer, TTM, Tokyo, 100 kg). At each wave of data
collection, grip strength was measured for both hands twice,
and the mean of the maximum values obtained for each
hand was used for the outcome [19]. The cut-off for LMS
was then computed according to the literature [24, 25] (see
the Supplementary data available in Age and Ageing online for
more details on all the measures).
Statistical analysis
Logistic mixed-effect models were used for the analyses.
These models are a type of mixed model that accounts for
the nested structure of the data (e.g. multiple observations
within a single participant), thereby providing accurate par-
ameter estimates with acceptable type I error rates [26].
Analyses were stratified by sex. Model 1 tested the associ-
ation between early-life SEC and the probability of LMS,
adjusting for prior confounders. Age was centred at the
midpoint of the sample’s age range (i.e. 73 years). To adjust
for cohort effects, the models included birth cohort and an
interaction term between birth cohort and age. In addition,

 an interaction term between early-life SEC and age was
included to test whether early-life SEC moderated the
association of age with LMS. Education (model 2), main
occupational position (model 3), satisfaction with house-
hold income (model 4), unhealthy behaviour index (model
5), and their interactions with age, were sequentially
added as potential mediators in the model. Finally, we
performed the following five sensitivity analyses: (i) con-
trolling for the physical demands of the main job; (ii)
excluding participants older than 90 because the descrip-
tive statistics showed few observations above this age; (iii)
excluding participants who died during the survey; (iv)
excluding participants who dropped out; and (v) exclud-
ing participants with at least one of the following chronic
conditions: self-reported heart attack, high blood pres-
sure, stroke, diabetes, chronic lung disease, Parkinson’s
disease or cancer.
Results
Descriptive results
The data set stratified by sex and early-life SEC is described
in Supplementary Table S1 (available in Age and Ageing online).
The total sample included 24,179 participants (96,375 obser-
vations; 13,477 women) living in 14 European countries
(Supplementary Figure S1, available in Age and Ageing online).
Results revealed an increased prevalence of LMS in those
with disadvantaged early-life SEC for both sexes.
Association of early-life SEC with LMS (model 1)
The risk of LMS was significantly increased with ageing for all
cohorts (P-values < 0.001). For women at the midpoint of the
age range, disadvantaged, middle, advantaged, and most
advantaged early-life SEC were associated with a decreased
risk of LMS, compared with most disadvantaged early-life
SEC [odds ratios (ORs) = 0.67, 0.48, 0.36 and 0.33, respect-
ively; Table 1, and Figure 1].
For men at the midpoint of the age range, disadvan-
taged, middle and advantaged early-life SEC were asso-
ciated with a decreased risk of LMS, compared with most
disadvantaged early-life SEC (ORs = 0.59, 0.57 and 0.53,
respectively; Table 1, Figure 1). In contrast, no significant
difference was observed between most advantaged and
most disadvantaged early-life SEC. However, because of
the low number of observations within the most advan-
taged early-life SEC, this result should be interpreted cau-
tiously. Additionally, the adverse associations between
ageing and risk of LMS were significantly less pronounced
in the advantaged compared with the most disadvantaged
early-life SEC in men only (OR = 0.97; interaction between
age and advantaged early-life SEC).
Association of adult-life SEC and unhealthy
behaviours with LMS (models 2–5)
For women, the associations between early-life SEC and LMS
were gradually attenuated but remained significant with the
addition of education (model 2), main occupation (model 3),

 satisfaction with household income (model 4), and unhealthy
behaviour index (model 5) (Supplementary Figure S2 available
in Age and Ageing online). Low education (OR = 2.13; model
2), disadvantaged occupational position (OR = 1.75; model 3),
low satisfaction with household income (OR = 6.88; model 4)
and number of unhealthy behaviours (OR = 7.14; model 5)
were associated with an increased risk of LMS. Additionally,
the adverse relationships between ageing and LMS were signifi-
cantly more pronounced in women with a lower compared
with a higher level of satisfaction with household income (inter-
action between age and satisfaction with household income;
model 4). In the fully adjusted model (model 5), the add-
ition of the adult-life SEC indicators and the unhealthy
behaviour index to model 1 reduced the associations of
the disadvantaged, middle, advantaged and most advan-
taged early-life SEC with LMS by 43, 49, 47 and 65%,
respectively. Similar to early-life SEC, the associations
between education and LMS (model 2) were gradually attenu-
ated with the addition of main occupation, satisfaction with
household income, and the unhealthy behaviour index but
remained significant. The attenuation of these associations was
stronger for satisfaction with household income, compared with
the other adult-life mediators (Table 1).
For men, the associations between early-life SEC and
LMS were gradually attenuated with the addition of educa-
tion (model 2), main occupational position (model 3) and
satisfaction with household income (model 4) to become
non-significant except for the disadvantaged early-life SEC
(Supplementary Figure S2 available in Age and Ageing
online).). In particular, low education (OR = 1.32; model
2), disadvantaged occupation (OR = 1.94; model 3), low
satisfaction with household income (OR = 2.58; model 4)
and number of unhealthy behaviours (OR = 5.26; model 5)
were associated with an increased risk of LMS. Additionally,
the adverse relationships between ageing and LMS were sig-
nificantly more pronounced for men with a high number of
unhealthy behaviours (OR = 1.04; interaction between age
and unhealthy behaviours). In the model adjusted for adult-
life SEC (model 5), the addition of the adult-life SEC indica-
tors to model 1 reduced the associations of the disadvan-
taged, middle and advantaged early-life SEC with LMS by 26,
60 and 84%, respectively. Similar to early-life SEC, the asso-
ciations between education and LMS (model 2) were grad-
ually attenuated with the addition of main occupation,
satisfaction with household income, and unhealthy behaviour
index but remained significant. The attenuation of these asso-
ciations was stronger for satisfaction with household income,
compared with the other adult-life mediators (Table 2).
Sensitivity analysis
Overall, the results of the sensitivity analyses were consistent
with those of the main analyses, with the association between
early-life SEC and risk of LMS remaining unchanged for both
sexes, except for the interaction effect of the advantaged
early-life SEC with ageing in men, which became marginal or
non-significant in some sensitivity analyses. Additionally, the
associations were gradually attenuated with the addition of adult-
life SEC and unhealthy behaviour index, with some of the associa-
tions remaining significant, especially for women. Moreover, the
effect of the association of adult-life SEC and the unhealthy
behaviour index on risk of LMS remained unchanged.
Discussion
Main findings
This large-scale longitudinal study investigated whether early-
life SEC are associated with muscle strength in later life—a
biomarker of health—and, if so, whether adult-life SEC
and health behaviours explained this association. Using a
12-year population-based cohort study of 24,179 indivi-
duals, we found that the risk of LMS was increased for
individuals with disadvantaged early-life SEC for both
sexes, especially in women. Advantaged early-life SEC were
also associated with a decreased risk of LMS with ageing
for men. However, this effect on the evolution of LMS
with ageing was inconsistent across the sensitivity analyses,
indicating that it was less robust.
These associations between early-life SEC and risk of
LMS were explained by the three indicators of adult-life SEC
(education, main occupational position and satisfaction with
household income) for both sexes, and with the unhealthy
behaviour index for women. Despite adjusting for adult-life
SEC, the associations between early-life SEC and LMS
remained significant, especially in women, for whom the asso-
ciations were only slightly attenuated. These results suggest
that early-life SEC were both directly and indirectly associated
with LMS in older age. Finally, the risk of LMS with ageing
was associated with low level of satisfaction with household
income for women and high number of unhealthy behaviours
for men, so adult-life SEC influenced not only the risk of
LMS but also its evolution with age.
Comparison with other studies
Our findings support previous cross-sectional or short longitu-
dinal studies that investigated the effect of life-course SEC on
muscle strength trajectories in the ageing population [8, 9].
They showed that early-life SEC are associated with muscle
strength even after adjusting for adult-life SEC and behav-
ioural lifestyle factors. This partial explanation supports our
hypothesis that early-life SEC could be associated with adult
health outcomes through three different pathways: two indirect
pathways (socioeconomic and behavioural) and one direct bio-
logical pathway. Furthermore, the important role played by sat-
isfaction with household income in the process is in line with
the biological pathway hypothesis, suggesting that factors asso-
ciated with chronic stress have a cumulative physiological wear-
and-tear effect, and are thus likely to have a detrimental effect
on health-related outcomes such as muscle strength. Indeed,
low satisfaction with household income is associated with high-
er levels of chronic psychosocial stress [27] compared with the
other adult-life indicators. Chronic stress is associated with the
lack of ability to purchase goods and services, acting in a way

 that extends life and eroding the capacity to cope [28].
Finally, results showed that early-life SEC are associated
with the risk of LMS, but not with its trajectory across
ageing, whereas adult-life SEC and behaviour lifestyle fac-
tors are associated with both. These findings support the
concept of sensitive periods and social pathways linking
early life and adult diseases [29]. More precisely, exposure
to disadvantaged SEC at the sensitive age of 10 may affect
adult health and/or channel individuals into future disad-
vantaged life trajectories.
Strengths and limitations
The strengths of our study include a large sample size, a 12-
year follow-up with repeated measurements every 2 years and
the use of an accurate biomarker of healthy ageing.
However, one limitation is that early- and adult-life SEC
information was extracted from self-reported retrospective
life-course data and may therefore be subject to recall bias
or social desirability bias. Regardless, previous research sug-
gested a satisfactory validity of recall measures of socio-
economic status. Secondly, the early-life SEC score used in
the current study combined different indicators of childhood
circumstances. The construction of this score is recom-
mended [23] but examining how each SEC indicator is
related to LMS could also be interesting. Thirdly, this score
reflects specific remembered conditions at the age of 10,
which do not necessarily reflect the whole of childhood.
Fourthly, attrition is an issue in longitudinal studies and may
lead to a potential selection bias in the remaining sample.
We dealt with this limitation by adjusting analyses for attri-
tion and conducting sensitivity analyses excluding partici-
pants who dropped out or died. Fifthly, the unhealthy
behaviours index may feature some misclassification bias
because the index was computed by using the mean of four
unhealthy behaviours. However, data were missing due to
changes in some questions asked during the successive
waves, and thus this bias should be non-differential and only
reduce the association toward the null hypothesis. The
strength of the observed associations supports the validity
of this index.
Conclusion and public health implications
Our findings showed that early-life SEC is associated with a
biomarker of healthy ageing—muscle strength—especially
in women. This association was gradually attenuated with
the addition of adult-life SEC and unhealthy behaviours.
However, early-life SEC remained associated with muscle
strength after adjusting for these factors, which supports
the idea that early-life SEC represents a sensitive period
that could be associated with health in later-life through
both direct and indirect pathways. The direct and indirect
effects of early-life SEC demonstrated here strengthen the
evidence supporting public policies intervening in child-
hood to promote better health in later life.

 Key points
• Early-life socioeconomic circumstances represents a sensi-
tive period for health in later life, especially in women.
• Early-life socioeconomic circumstances are associated
with muscle strength after adjusting for adult socio-
economic circumstances and behavioural lifestyle factors.
• Policy interventions during childhood may help to pro-
mote better health in later life.
