consumption in patients with rheumatoid

ABSTRACT
Background Patients with rheumatoid arthritis (RA)
who take methotrexate (MTX) are advised to limit their
alcohol intake due to potential combined hepatotoxicity.
However, data are limited to support this. The aim of
this study was to quantify the risk of developing
abnormal liver blood tests at different levels of alcohol
consumption, using routinely collected data from primary
care.
Methods Patients with RA in the Clinical Practice
Research Datalink starting MTX between 1987 and
2016 were included. Hepatotoxicity was defined as
transaminitis: alanine transaminase or aspartate
aminotransferase more than three times the upper limit
of normal. Crude rates of transaminitis were calculated
per 1000 person-years, categorised by weekly alcohol
consumption in units. Cox proportional hazard models
tested the association between alcohol consumption and
transaminitis univariately, then age and gender adjusted.
Results 11 839 patients were included, with 530
episodes of transaminitis occurring in 47 090 person-
years follow-up. Increased weekly alcohol consumption
as a continuous variable was associated with increased
risk of transaminitis, adjusted HR (95% CI) per unit
consumed 1.01 (1.00 to 1.02); consuming between 15
and 21 units was associated with a possible increased
risk of hepatotoxicity, while drinking >21 units per week
significantly increased rates of transaminitis, adjusted HR
(95% CI) 1.85 (1.17 to 2.93).
Conclusions Weekly alcohol consumption of <14 units
per week does not appear to be associated with an
increased risk of transaminitis.
BACKGROUND
Methotrexate
(MTX)
is
the
first-line
disease-
modifying antirheumatic drug in patients with
rheumatoid arthritis (RA).1 It is clinically effective
and well tolerated;2 however, the potential hepato-
toxicity of MTX remains a concern,3 and regular
blood monitoring is mandated. Alcohol consump-
tion is also well known to have an adverse effect on
the liver, particularly in excess.4 5 Given these two
associations, patients taking MTX have tradition-
ally been advised to limit or even abstain from
alcohol consumption. The American College of
Rheumatology
(ACR)
guidelines,
published
in
1994, recommend abstinence from alcohol with
only occasional exceptions.6 In contrast, more
recent
guidance
from
the
British
Society
for
Rheumatology, published in 2008, suggests that
patients taking MTX should limit their alcohol
intake to ‘well within the UK national recommen-
dations’,7 without further specification.
While the relationship between MTX and hep-
atotoxicity has been extensively reviewed,3 there is
a lack of evidence to quantify the potential add-
itional effect of alcohol on liver toxicity while
taking MTX. Indeed, the ACR guidance comments
that regular alcohol consumption should not occur
since there are ‘no data about the quantity of
alcohol that can safely be consumed with MTX’.6
The majority of studies which have examined this
question have focused on histopathological changes
in serial liver biopsies,8 9 and frequently date back
to the 1970s. By contrast, current monitoring
guidelines advocate measuring of serum liver func-
tion tests (LFTs).7 Importantly, previous studies
have not consistently demonstrated an association
between increased alcohol consumption and hep-
atotoxicity or liver damage;9–14 yet, it is clearly bio-
logically plausible that there may be an additive.
Many patients would like to drink modestly; in the
absence of evidence, such patients may be inclined
or advised to either abstain from alcohol altogether
or avoid MTX, a potentially beneficial drug. If
patients do drink alcohol alongside MTX, even in
moderation,
they
anecdotally
describe
feeling
anxious or ill at ease. Understanding whether there
is a safe amount of alcohol that can be consumed
alongside MTX, and what that amount is, would
significantly aid informed decision-making.
The aim of this study, therefore, was to quantify
the risk of alcohol consumption on hepatotoxicity
in a contemporary group of MTX users with RA,
in a large national primary care database.
METHODS
Patients and setting
Patients
with
RA within
the
Clinical
Practice
Research Datalink (CPRD) were identified using a
previously validated algorithm.15 CPRD is a large
electronic database of routinely collected primary
care electronic medical records, beginning in 1987,
which includes approximately 8% of the total UK
population and is considered broadly representative
of the UK population in terms of age, gender and
ethnicity.16 In the UK, MTX therapy is typically
initiated in a secondary care setting by a rheuma-
tologist, but subsequent prescriptions and blood
monitoring are performed in primary care, and are
therefore
recorded
within
their
primary
care

 electronic records. All patients with RA starting MTX after
1987 were included once a practice had met data quality stan-
dards required for participation in CPRD. Follow-up was com-
menced from the date of the first MTX prescription and
continued until February 2016, unless patients were censored
earlier (see below).
Exposures and outcome
The outcome of interest was an episode of transaminitis,
defined as alanine transaminase (ALT) or aspartate aminotrans-
ferase (AST) levels of three times the upper limit of normal
(ULN) or higher, according to local laboratory standards.
Patients were included in the analysis if they had ALT and AST
measured on average at least six times per 12 months to indicate
compliance with regular blood monitoring and avoid introdu-
cing surveillance bias. Prior studies have identified persistently
raised LFTs as being predictive of progression to cirrhosis;17
hence we had a secondary definition of transaminitis as three
sequential ALT or AST measurements above the ULN. Alcohol
consumption was identified first as yes/no, then by units of
alcohol consumed per week. A unit of alcohol represents 10 mL
or 8 g of pure alcohol,18 and is used in the UK to make compar-
isons of alcohol consumption across different beverages. It is
also used by the UK government to set national guidelines; cur-
rently, the guidance is to drink no more than 14 units of alcohol
per week for both men and women.19 Prior to January 2016,
the limit for men was higher at 21 units per week. For patients
who had alcohol status recorded more than once within CPRD,
the value used was the earliest recorded alcohol consumption
data following first MTX prescription. If this was not available,
then the nearest alcohol consumption data recorded prior to the
first MTX prescription were used. If the only data available on
alcohol consumption was yes/no, patients who did not drink
were recorded as drinking zero alcohol units, to increase the
power of the study. As patients sometimes undertake pauses in
their MTX treatment, either through their own choice or
through clinician recommendation, person-time was included in
the analysis only while patients were actively receiving MTX.
Thus, person-time and events of transaminitis occurring while
the patient was not taking the drug were excluded. Patients
were censored at the time of the first episode of transaminitis,
death or 29 February 2016.
Statistical analysis
Crude
rates
of
transaminitis
were
calculated
per
1000 -
person-years first for all patients, then in drinkers versus non-
drinkers and finally by dividing alcohol units into categories of
increasing consumption (0/1–7 (mild)/8–14 (moderate)/15–21
(moderate–high) and >21 (high)). Cox proportional hazard
models were used to investigate the association between alcohol
consumption and time to first episode of transaminitis, both
univariately and age and gender adjusted. As for the crude rates,
a number of different models were constructed. First, the risk of
transaminitis was identified in drinkers versus non-drinkers,
then in the four alcohol unit categories and finally treating
alcohol units consumed as a continuous variable. Posterior prob-
ability graphs were drawn to assess the probability of the HR
exceeding a clinically significant increase, set a priori at a 50%
increase in rates of transaminitis, in each of the four categories
of alcohol consumption compared with no alcohol consump-
tion. All analyses were carried out for both primary and second-
ary definitions of transaminitis.
RESULTS
A total of 44 586 patients with RA were identified, of whom
11 839 were included in the study (figure 1, flow chart); 8401

 (71%) were female, and mean age (SD) was 61 (13.9) years.
Baseline demographic information is shown in table 1; further
details of demographics at each stage of exclusion are available
in online supplementary table S1. Excluded patients were
slightly younger than patients included in the final study. If only
information on whether they drank alcohol at all (rather than
weekly units) was available, they were more likely to be female,
and a much higher percentage drank no alcohol (60% vs 33%).
This is likely because these patients would automatically be
assumed to drink zero units of alcohol per week, but this may
not be recorded separately. As shown in table 1, the vast major-
ity of patients (7764/9907, 78%) were mild drinkers (≤7 units
per week) or drank no alcohol; only 799 (8%) consumed more
than the UK recommended limit of 14 units per week. Using
the primary definition of transaminitis, there were 530 first epi-
sodes of transaminitis in 47 090 person-years follow-up, giving
a crude event rate of 11.26 per 1000 person-years. Crude rates
of transaminitis were similar between patients who consumed
any amount of alcohol and non-drinkers, at 10.08 and 10.64
per 1000 person-years, and in the age-adjusted and gender-
adjusted Cox model, there was no increased risk in the occur-
rence of transaminitis in drinkers compared with non-drinkers;
HR (95% CI) 1.06 (0.86 to 1.30).
Crude rates of transaminitis appeared to increase with increas-
ing levels of alcohol consumption (table 2). In the adjusted Cox
model, mild-to-moderate alcohol consumption (both 1–7 and
8–14 units per week) was not associated with a statistically sig-
nificant risk of developing transaminitis compared with non-
drinkers (table 2), with HRs (95% CIs) of 1.02 (0.82 to 1.28)
and 0.98 (0.71 to 1.35), respectively. There was a trend to
higher HR with higher levels of alcohol consumption (table 2)
and a statistically significant increase in rates of transaminitis for
those patients consuming over 21 units per week compared with
non-drinkers, both univariately and in the adjusted model;
adjusted HR (95% CI) 1.85 (1.17 to 2.93). Finally, when
treated as a continuous variable, each increased unit of alcohol
consumed was associated with a higher risk of transaminitis;
adjusted HR (95% CI) 1.01 (1.00 to 1.02).
Posterior probability graphs (figure 2) demonstrated that
alcohol consumption below 14 units per week was associated
with a very low probability (0.93%) of having a clinically
important (≥50%) increased risk of transaminitis. For alcohol
consumption exceeding 14 units per week, the probability of
having a clinically important increased risk of transaminitis
was higher, specifically 33% and 81% for moderate–high
(15–21 units)
and
high
(>21 units)
alcohol
consumption,
respectively.
Using the secondary definition of transaminitis, there was
again no increased risk with 1–7 or 8–14 units of alcohol per
week (adjusted HR (95% CI) 0.98 (0.83 to 1.16) and 0.95
(0.75 to 1.21), respectively). There was a non-significant
increased risk seen in those consuming 15–21 or >21 units of
alcohol per week (HRs 1.18 (0.84 to 1.65) and 1.26 (0.87 to
1.81), respectively). The posterior probabilities were lower for
all alcohol consumption categories: below 14 units of alcohol
per week, the probability of having a clinically important
(≥50%) risk of transaminitis was 0.01%, and for moderate–high
(15–21 units) and high (>21 units) alcohol consumption, 8%
and 17%, respectively (see online supplementary table S2 and
figure S1).
DISCUSSION
In this study, we have demonstrated that the risk of transaminitis
in patients with RA taking MTX does increase with increasing
levels of alcohol consumption. However, the risk in those
patients who consume ≤14 units of alcohol per week is no
greater than those who do not drink alcohol. This is the first
study to provide quantifiable estimates of the risk of different
levels of alcohol consumption while taking MTX, in a large
group of patients who take long-term MTX. The study has
important clinical implications. At present, there is uncertainty
about the acceptable levels of alcohol consumption while taking
MTX, and different rheumatologists and healthcare practi-
tioners may give different advice on what is safe. This can lead
to patients avoiding MTX altogether in favour of modest (and
perhaps safe) alcohol consumption and thus missing its potential
benefits; avoiding any alcohol and potentially affecting their
quality of life; or worrying about the potential consequences of
any alcohol they consume.
In the literature, there are a small number of studies which
have provided a quantitative measure of the risk of alcohol

 consumption and hepatotoxicity in MTX users.9 13 In a study
recruiting patients between 1979 and 1990, Malatjalian et al9
examined biopsy before and after MTX therapy retrospectively
in a cohort of patients with psoriasis starting MTX. They found
no significant difference in progression of liver biopsy grades
between patients drinking more or less than 14 units of alcohol
per week. Laharie et al13 used a fibroscan technique to investi-
gate the presence of fibrosis in a non-invasive manner in 518
patients taking MTX for a variety of indications, including
Crohn’s disease and psoriasis as well as RA. They showed that
alcohol consumption of >14 units per week was associated with
increased fibrosis. However, neither the total dose of MTX nor
duration of use was associated with higher fibrosis scores, sug-
gesting the association between alcohol consumption and liver
fibrosis is the same in MTX users as in the general population.
This study was limited by its cross-sectional nature; in addition,
this technique has not yet been adopted widely in clinical prac-
tice, and certainly not in the context of monitoring MTX
therapy.
A key difficulty with the literature is that studies were often
conducted in the 1970s and 1980s, and almost exclusively in
patients being treated with MTX for psoriasis, with fewer data
on patients with RA.10 11 20–22 They were frequently retrospect-
ive with small numbers, and some included pretreatment biop-
sies which demonstrate abnormalities pre-existent to MTX
therapy.10 Most importantly, however, MTX prescribing and
monitoring practices differ markedly now from the time at
which the studies were conducted. Critically, liver biopsies are
now rarely performed as part of routine monitoring, as there is
considerable morbidity and mortality associated with the pro-
cedure.23 Our data therefore provide more useful insight into
the consequences of consuming alcohol while undergoing stand-
ard MTX monitoring practice in this era.
Some studies have looked at rates of liver enzyme abnormal-
ities. Curtis et al24 studied patients with both RA and psoriatic
arthritis, taking leflunomide and MTX. Their results suggested
that LFT derangement in patients taking MTX/leflunomide is
significantly more likely in patients who drink one to two alco-
holic drinks per day, compared with non-MTX/leflunomide
users. However this is not useful if we are attempting to provide
information to patients beginning MTX therapy; for them, we
need to know the risk of alcohol consumption while taking
MTX. Kent et al studied25 risk factors for the occurrence of
abnormal LFTs in a cohort of patients with RA taking MTX
from 1991 to 2002. They found no significant association
between current alcohol use and abnormal LFTs. However,
there are issues with this study. They included any elevation of
AST above the ULN as an event of interest, which may capture a
large number of false positives of no clinical significance. In
addition, they used standard linear regression as opposed to
Cox models, which would not take into account the fact that
once a person has had an elevated AST
, they are more likely to
have that blood test repeated. This could lead to counting ele-
vated AST measure more than once, when in fact they are part
of the same clinical incidence.
As there is evidence that persistently raised LFTs may be pre-
dictive of hepatotoxicity,17 we used a secondary transaminitis
definition of three consecutive LFTs above the ULN. Using this
definition, the results were generally similar with reassurance
that up to 14 units of alcohol per week did not increase the risk
of hepatotoxicity and a suggestion that higher alcohol consump-
tion did increase the risk. One limitation with this approach is
that the outcome definition requires three sequential raised
values. If a clinician sees a clinically meaningful rise in LFTs,
they would be inclined to stop the MTX therapy following
which the transaminases may return to normal and thus not
fulfil the outcome definition of three sequential abnormal
results. Nonetheless, it is reassuring that both analyses give
similar confidence in the safety of modest alcohol consumption.
There are a number of other limitations within our study. The
setting within primary care database means that we have to rely
on existing general practitioner (GP) codes to identify cases of
RA. W
e used previously validated algorithms15; however, it is
possible that some misclassification remains. Given that the study
design constrained the RA population to MTX users, misclassifi-
cation is likely to be less than that for an unselected RA cohort.
Alcohol use was self-reported, and thus is also prone to misclassi-
fication. Patients may be more inclined to underestimate their
alcohol consumption, although this would not explain the appar-
ent safety of modest alcohol consumption: were drinkers

 reporting lower consumption, we would expect hepatotoxicity in
these lower alcohol groups to be higher. Validity of self-reported
alcohol consumptions in routinely collected clinical data such as
CPRD is not well described. However, although response bias
has been reported in survey data literature,26 there are other data
to suggest self-reported alcohol consumption largely valid and
reliable, particularly in women.27 28 It is possible that alcohol use
changed through time following commencement of MTX.
Unfortunately, there was not sufficient alcohol data recorded to
allow us to consider changing use through time.
Patients were included only if they had six or more LFTs mea-
sured per year, as those with fewer blood tests would automatic-
ally have a lower chance of abnormal LFTs due to observation
bias. That said, patients with high levels of alcohol consumption
might be less likely to attend for regular blood test and could
have been excluded from the study. However, the baseline
characteristics of patients who remained in the study were
similar to those who were excluded. Despite the large dataset,
the number of events identified was relatively small, particularly
in groups consuming high levels of alcohol. Knowing that we
might therefore generate results that were not statistically signifi-
cant, yet still potentially clinically meaningful, we chose to also
present results as the probability of the HR exceeding a clinically
significant increase of 50%. W
e demonstrated that this was
much higher in patients consuming more alcohol. As with all
observational data, there may have been unmeasured confound-
ing that we were not able to adjust for, for example, disease
severity. There may have been other comorbidities that could
explain the raised LFTs that were not measured. W
e did not
consider the dose of MTX as it was only available in patients
included in the study before 2011, as this would have further
limited the study power to detect differences between different
levels of alcohol consumption. It is possible that hepatotoxicity
may be higher in patients with higher MTX dosage, although
dose is typically titrated upward while monitoring LFTs. A bias
may be possible if clinicians give differing doses to patients who
drink different levels of alcohol. At higher levels of alcohol con-
sumption, lower dosage would be more likely, and thus the
proven increased risk in the high alcohol groups may well be an
underestimate of the true risk. Finally, it should be noted that
while we have identified no increased risk of transaminitis when
consuming <14 units of alcohol per week, this may not capture
all hepatotoxicity. It has been suggested that monitoring LFTs is
insufficient to assess long-term damage to the liver from MTX,
as patients may progress to fibrosis without ever having episodes
of
transaminitis.29
Nevertheless,
serum
LFT
measurement
remains current best practice for monitoring MTX therapy;7
therefore, our findings are relevant.
In conclusion, in the largest study of its kind to date, we have
shown no increase in the risk of transaminitis in patients who
consume <14 units alcohol per week while taking MTX. This
may provide the practical and useful information that drinking
alcohol within nationally recommended levels in the UK is safe,
in terms of risk of transaminitis, for patients commencing MTX
therapy for RA. Our study was conducted only in patients with
RA and thus cannot be automatically generalisable to other
populations. Previous data have suggested that patients with
psoriasis may have higher incidence of liver disease in general
compared with patients with RA,13 and therefore confirmatory
studies would be required in these patient groups. Inclusion of
acceptable alcohol levels into clinical guidelines and patient
information
leaflets
may
well
improve
informed
decision-
making, clinical outcomes, reduce decision conflict and improve
overall quality of life.
