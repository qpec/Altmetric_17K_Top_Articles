Although both males and females become addicted to cocaine, females transition to addic-
tion faster and experience greater difficulties remaining abstinent. We demonstrate an
oestrous cycle-dependent mechanism controlling increased cocaine reward in females.
During oestrus, ventral tegmental area (VTA) dopamine neuron activity is enhanced and
drives post translational modifications at the dopamine transporter (DAT) to increase the
ability of cocaine to inhibit its function, an effect mediated by estradiol. Female mice
conditioned to associate cocaine with contextual cues during oestrus have enhanced
mesolimbic responses to these cues in the absence of drug. Using chemogenetic approaches,
we increase VTA activity to mechanistically link oestrous cycle-dependent enhancement of
VTA firing to enhanced cocaine affinity at DAT and subsequent reward processing. These
data have implications for sexual dimorphism in addiction vulnerability and define
a mechanism by which cellular activity results in protein alterations that contribute to
dysfunctional learning and reward processing.

rug addiction is a debilitating neuropsychiatric disorder
characterized by high levels of drug intake, drug seeking
and repeated cycles of abstinence and relapse1. Although
both males and females become addicted to cocaine, females
are reported to transition to addiction faster, take more cocaine,
experience more adverse consequences and have more difficulty
remaining abstinent in humans2. In the human literature,
although males are more likely to be given the opportunity to
try cocaine than females, both sexes progressed to regular use
at an equal rate once exposed to cocaine3,4. Further, when
opportunity for drug use is taken into consideration, female use
exceeds that of males4,5. Women are also more likely to
use cocaine at an earlier age6, take drugs in larger quantities5,7,
report greater difficulty remaining abstinent8 and relapse9,10.
Although these sex differences in humans could be caused by
psychosocial and cultural factors, as well as neurobiological
mechanisms, similar sex differences are observed in animal
models and the precise neurobiological mechanisms of these
sex
differences
in
drug-reward
processing
remain
poorly
understood.
In addition to females displaying evidence for higher risk
for addiction than males, there are also several reports of
menstrual cycle-dependent fluctuations in the subjective effects of
cocaine and drug craving in females11,12. In humans, both the
cardiovascular and subjective responses to cocaine were reduced
during the luteal phase of the menstrual cycle13, when oestrogen
levels are declining. Conversely, during the follicular phase, when
oestrogen levels are rising, women reported a greater ‘high’
from cocaine administration11,13, suggesting a potential link
between ovarian hormones and drug craving. Although the
menstrual cycle has not definitively been linked to this process in
humans, these reports nonetheless raise the possibility of sexually
dimorphic
mechanisms
of
reward
processing
and
suggest
that menstrual/oestrous cycle effects may be involved.
Circulating
ovarian
hormones,
including
oestrogens,
act
throughout the entire nervous system via non-genomic and
genomic mechanisms.
During development, X-chromosome
genes play a role in developmental programming of the dopamine
system via genetic and hormonal factors that can lead to sex
differences in both basal function and the hormonal control over
these processes14–16. Accordingly, multiple studies have shown
sex differences in the ability of estradiol to stimulate dopamine
release17,18, which could act to drive the increased reward
learning that occurs during oestrus. Although these changes in
reward learning that occur in oestrus can be viewed as adaptive to
promote survival, the process might also lead to changes in drug
reward, thus increasing drug abuse vulnerability. However,
the precise mechanisms by which this occurs remain to be
elucidated.
Studies in animal models have implicated ovarian hormone-
dependent changes in drug reward functioning19. However, most
of
these
investigations
used
ovariectomized
females
with
hormone replacement to observe these effects, ablating the
natural fluctuations in hormones observed with the oestrous
cycle. To determine oestrous cycle-dependent, sexually dimorphic
cellular and molecular mechanisms controlling cocaine reward,
we used electrophysiology, fast-scan cyclic voltammetry (FSCV)
and in vivo calcium imaging via fibre photometry to study the
ability of male and naturally cycling, intact female mice in either
dioestrus (low circulating hormones) or oestrus (high circulating
hormones) to associate the rewarding effects of cocaine with the
contextual
cues
that
predict
cocaine
administration.
By
monitoring cycle stages of female mice, we determined how
oestrous cycle-dependent fluctuations in reward system activity
underlie reward processing and how this can influence addiction
vulnerability. Here we outline a mechanism by which enhanced
function of the dopamine system converges with increased
pharmacological effects of cocaine to enhance these associations.
Results
Oestrus females form stronger cue-reward associations. We
first conducted conditioned place preference (CPP) for cocaine,
which provides an indirect measure of drug reward, in male and
intact female C57BL/6J mice. Animals were injected with
10 mg kg � 1 intraperitoneally (i.p.) cocaine and confined to one
side of a three-chamber CPP apparatus. In alternating sessions,
the other chamber was paired with saline (Fig. 1a). Vaginal
cytology was performed daily to determine cycle stage for each
female throughout the sessions. In a choice test 24 h after the final
pairing, male and female mice were allowed to freely explore both
chambers in the absence of drug.
Both male and female mice spent more time on the side
that was previously paired with cocaine; however, female mice
exhibited higher levels of place preference compared with males,
indicating
enhanced
reward
to
this
moderate
cocaine
dose (Supplementary Fig. 1). Interestingly, this enhanced cocaine
reward was unique to female mice that were conditioned
specifically during proestrus/oestrus, with female mice condi-
tioned during dioestrus (dioestrus I and II) forming place
preferences similar to those seen in male mice (Fig. 1b,c). These
oestrous cycle-dependent conditioning effects indicate a unique
mechanism by which cue-reward associations are enhanced
selectively during oestrus.
Oestrus females show enhanced dopamine function. Both drug
reward and cue-reward associations (that is, associative learning)
are dependent on dopaminergic transmission from the ventral
tegmental area (VTA) to the nucleus accumbens (NAc)20. Phasic
firing of VTA dopamine neurons is a critical component in
associative learning between environmental cues and rewarding
stimuli21. We thus wanted to determine whether there was
differential basal VTA dopamine neuron activity and firing
properties between male, oestrus female and dioestrus female
mice.
Using anaesthetized, single-unit in vivo electrophysiology in
drug-naive male mice, dioestrus female mice and oestrus female
mice, we found that female mice overall exhibit increased basal
putative VTA dopamine neuron activity when compared with
male mice (Supplementary Fig. 2a–d). However, the increased
putative VTA dopamine neuron firing rate was specific for female
mice in oestrus (Fig. 1d,e). Furthermore, the percentage of spikes
found in bursts and the burst lengths were also significantly
higher in oestrus females than males and dioestrus females
(Fig. 1d,f,g and Supplementary Fig. 2e). This is consistent with a
previous report that female rats in oestrus displayed increased
basal putative VTA dopamine neuron activity and bursting when
compared with female rats in dioestrus22. Together, these data
demonstrate a selective enhancement in basal neural activity of
the reward system during oestrus.
Although phasic activity of VTA dopamine neurons is a critical
mediator of reward encoding, ultimately dopamine release from
nerve terminals in the NAc is the outcome that encodes this
reward processing23. Studies using microdialysis have previously
shown elevated dopamine tone in the NAc of oestrus females24;
however, microdialysis is unable to distinguish between tonic and
phasic dopamine levels to identify the temporal profile of
dopaminergic responses. Using FSCV in the NAc in brain
slices, we measured subsecond dopamine release that occurs in
response to tonic and phasic stimulation of dopamine terminals
originating in the VTA (Fig. 1h). We found that oestrus females,
compared with both males and dioestrus females, release two

Further,

Together, these data suggest that the dopaminergic VTA-NAc
circuit of oestrus females is more active, even before cocaine
conditioning. Increases in dopamine release can be due to
increases in dopamine synthesis or in alterations in feedback
mechanisms at the level of the nerve terminal. Levels of tyrosine
hydroxylase (TH), the rate-limiting enzyme for dopamine
synthesis, were not changed, nor was the phosphorylation of

 oestrus, the reward system is primed to respond maximally to
salient stimuli, an effect that could increase the likelihood of
associations between rewards and predictive cues during this
period.
Fluctuations in the VTA-NAc circuit are oestrous dependent.
Cocaine’s ability to alter dopaminergic transmission from the
VTA to the NAc has been proposed as a central mechanism
underlying its reinforcing and rewarding actions25. To examine
real-time activity of these neurons in vivo during associative
learning for drug rewards, we injected male and female C57BL/6J
mice with AAV5-CamKII-GCaMP6f into the VTA and recorded
Ca2 þ transients through two separate optic fibres implanted in
the VTA and the NAc during cocaine and saline conditioning
(Fig. 2a,b and Supplementary Figs 5 and 6a,b)26,27.
Consistent with electrophysiology data, we show enhanced
basal VTA activity in awake and behaving oestrus female mice as
compared with both male and dioestrus female mice (Fig. 2c and
Supplementary Fig. 7). Further, we show that although cocaine
suppressed VTA Ca2 þ events as measured by both frequency
(events per minute) and magnitude (% DF/F) in all groups
(Fig.
2c,d,f),
the
effect
of
cocaine
frequency
suppression
(% change) in the VTA was significantly higher in oestrus
females when compared with male and dioestrus female mice
(Fig. 2e). This same reduction in Ca2 þ activity was also observed
at VTA terminals in the NAc, whereby cocaine effects were
enhanced selectively during oestrus (Supplementary Fig. 6c–f).
Strikingly, the extent to which cocaine suppressed Ca2 þ events in
the VTA cell body and terminal regions was correlated with
cocaine CPP in each animal (Fig. 2g and Supplementary Fig. 6g),
demonstrating that the increased cocaine effect on the meso-
limbic reward system during conditioning is associated with the
enhanced reward processing.
Increased cocaine potency during oestrus. Ultimately, net
increases in dopamine in the NAc are proposed to mediate the
formation of cue-reward associations21. Cocaine elicits elevations
in dopamine levels, which leads to decreased VTA and NAc
terminal activity via D2 autoreceptor-mediated negative feedback
mechanisms28. Cocaine’s primary molecular mechanism is to
increase dopamine concentrations by directly binding to the
dopamine transporter (DAT) and inhibiting its ability to clear
dopamine from the synaptic cleft29,30. Using FSCV in NAc slices,
we assessed the ability of cocaine to bind to and inhibit DAT in
male and female dioestrus and oestrus mice (Fig. 2h). We found
that cocaine potency (apparent Km) is increased in oestrus
females (Fig. 2i,j). We also discovered that during oestrus,
cocaine’s ability to inhibit the clearance of dopamine is
potentiated, via a threefold decrease in Ki (3 � less cocaine is
needed to inhibit DAT; Fig. 2k). This result is indicative of an
increased affinity for cocaine to bind directly to DAT and inhibit
its uptake function in oestrus females.
To assess whether these effects could be due to circulating
hormone levels, we assayed progesterone and estradiol levels in
serum using enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA)
within each animal on blood collected immediately before FSCV
recordings. We found that circulating estradiol levels were
significantly higher in females in oestrus as compared with both
dioestrus females and males (Fig. 2l). Further, we found that
levels
of
estradiol,
but
not
progesterone
(Supplementary
Fig. 8a,b), were predictive of the enhanced cocaine potency at
the DAT (Fig. 2m).
Next, we determined whether the effects of estradiol on cocaine
potency represented a direct effect at dopamine terminals or an
indirect effect via activation of VTA cell bodies. Notably, for all
groups, the Km (affinity) of dopamine for DAT was not
significantly different before cocaine bath application, suggesting
that the effects of cocaine on DAT are distinct from any direct
effects of estradiol on the transporter (Fig. 2j). We further
confirmed this by perfusing NAc slices with estradiol at two
different concentrations (1 and 3 mM) and then completing a
concentration response curve for cocaine (Supplementary Fig. 9).
We found that estradiol had no direct effect on basal DAT
function, did not inhibit uptake on its own and did not change
the affinity of cocaine for DAT in any of the groups. These
findings suggest that the effects of estradiol on the dopamine
system originated upstream and lead to downstream adaptations
in dopamine terminals via an activity-dependent mechanism.
Although
the
most
parsimonious
explanation
for
these
observations is that alterations in cocaine effects on DAT are
primarily responsible for changes in cocaine reward learning, it is
important to rule out basal differences in dopamine release as
a factor driving these effects. Notably, baseline VTA and NAc
event frequency did not correlate with the extent of CPP formed
within each animal (Supplementary Fig. 10). Moreover, differ-
ences in baseline event frequency of VTA neuron cell body and
terminals
in
the
NAc
did
not

Supplementary Fig. 11). In addition, basal dopamine release as
measured by voltammetry was not correlated with cocaine’s
ability to inhibit DAT (Supplementary Fig. 12). Together, these
data argue against the possibility that basal differences in
increased firing and release drive changes in cocaine reward
learning and instead further support our interpretation that
oestrous cycle-dependent changes at DAT drive behaviour.
Further implicating direct changes to DAT in these processes
are data demonstrating that changes in basal uptake function or
DAT protein levels are dissociable from differences in cocaine
potency (Supplementary Fig. 13; also see ref. 31).
The link between VTA activity and changes at DAT is
important, as it is likely to be a compensatory change in response
to enhanced dopamine release at the terminal region. Indeed,
uptake rates of dopamine via the transporter are increased during
oestrus (Supplementary Fig. 13a). Although changes in DAT

 levels did not explain the changes in uptake rates or cocaine
effects during oestrus, we did discover differences in DAT
phosphorylation.
The
DAT
is
modulated
both
acutely
and chronically by phosphorylation, which can control dopami-
nergic neurotransmission and signalling quickly and during
temporally
specific
periods32.
One
such
site
is
threonine
53 (Thr53), which is located on the N-terminus of DAT and
has been shown to induce conformational changes in the
transporter and alter dopamine transport; this change in
conformation may be a possible mechanism for increased
affinity to stimulants33. Our data show that, although levels
of DAT are not different among the mice, levels of Thr53
phosphorylation are increased during oestrus (Fig. 2n), which
could explain both the enhanced cocaine effects and the increased
uptake function. In fact, Thr53 phosphorylation has been linked
to both activity-dependent changes in uptake function as well as
alterations in stimulant efficacy at the transporter34,35. Thr53
is
phosphorylated
by
extracellular
signal-regulated
kinase
(ERK) and work has shown that increasing ERK activity leads
to Thr53 phosphorylation, enhanced uptake rates and enhanced
amphetamine effects at the transporter34,36–40. Similarly, our data
show that during oestrus ERK phosphorylation is increased in the
NAc (Fig. 2o). The increase in phosphorylated ERK levels was
positively correlated with DAT Thr53 phosphorylation (Fig. 2p),
suggesting a potential activity-dependent mechanism by which
DAT can be modulated during oestrus, to increase the effects
of cocaine at DAT and drive enhanced CPP. Together, these data
provide a potential oestrous cycle-dependent mechanism for
increased cocaine binding to DAT, which is associated with
the enhanced behavioural responses to cocaine during the oestrus
phase.
Long-lasting VTA-NAc neural responses to drug-associated cues.
The VTA-NAc pathway is a key neural substrate of cue-reward
associations, as it mediates multiple aspects of this process
including learning, selecting and executing goal-oriented beha-
viours41. Over time, contextual cues in the absence of drug can
elicit neural responses that resemble that of the drug itself23,42
and trigger drug craving and seeking, resulting in relapse in drug-
addicted individuals43–47. The data presented thus far define one
mechanism for the enhanced rewarding effects of cocaine during
oestrus; however, they do not explain the enhanced cue-induced
drug-seeking and relapse that occurs in females when drugs of
abuse are no longer on board. Using in vivo fibre photometry
Ca2 þ imaging, we recorded from VTA cell bodies and their
terminals in the NAc during the choice test of the CPP paradigm
of male mice and female mice that were conditioned during
proestrus/oestrus or dioestrus (Fig. 3a,b). We then analysed
neural activity when mice entered the cocaine-paired context or
the saline-paired context.
We found that increases in VTA Ca2 þ activity preceded entry
into the cocaine-paired, but not saline-paired, chamber (Fig. 3c,e
and Supplementary Fig. 14). Interestingly, the magnitude of these
responses (DF/F) was significantly higher in oestrus-conditioned
female mice (Fig. 3c–e). It is important to note that these females
are no longer in oestrus during the choice testing; thus, the
associations that are formed between drugs and associated cues
during oestrus are potent and long lasting. Furthermore, the
amplitude of these signals was correlated significantly with the
extent
of
place
preference,
where
the
mice
with
the
largest amplitude of VTA response to the contextual cues exhibited
the greatest CPP (Fig. 3f). Equivalent responses were seen for VTA
nerve terminals in the NAc, whereby Ca2 þ transients preceded
drug paired, but not unpaired, entry (Fig. 3g,h). Accordingly, the
Ca2 þ transients in NAc that preceded drug-paired entry correlated
with VTA activity at the same time point (Fig. 3c,h), were increased
in oestrus-conditioned females (Fig. 3i,j) and were correlated with
the extent of the conditioned preference (Fig. 3k). These data show
that temporally precise signalling in the VTA-NAc pathway
encodes cocaine-context associations, which act to enhance choice
for drug-associated contexts.
Although the data presented above outline a role for the
VTA-NAc pathway in this process, they do not rule out the
contribution of non-dopaminergic projections originating in the
VTA in encoding this information. To this end, we used male and
female mice that express Cre-recombinase under the control of
the TH promoter (TH-BAC-Cre), combined with viral expression
of Cre-dependent AAV5-DIO-GCaMP6f in the VTA, to record
dopamine neuron-specific Ca2 þ transients through two separate
optic fibres implanted in the VTA and the NAc during cocaine
and saline conditioning (Fig. 4a,b)26,27,48. Consistent with
electrophysiology data and the global imaging data, we show
enhanced basal VTA activity of dopaminergic neurons in awake,
behaving oestrus female mice as compared with both male and
dioestrus female mice (Fig. 4c,d and Supplementary Fig. 15).
Further, we show that, although cocaine suppressed VTA neural
activity (Fig. 2c,d), the effect of cocaine in the VTA was
significantly higher in oestrus females when compared with
male and dioestrus female mice (Fig. 4c–e).
In addition, we recorded from dopamine neuron cell bodies in
the VTA and their terminals in the NAc during the choice test
and then analysed the Ca2 þ activity that occurred when mice
entered the cocaine-paired context (Fig. 4f). Again, the magnitude
of these responses (DF/F) was significantly higher in oestrus-
conditioned female mice when recording specifically from VTA
dopamine cell bodies (Fig. 4g,i). Equivalent responses were seen
for VTA dopamine nerve terminals in the NAc, whereby Ca2 þ

to
use
clozapine-N-oxide
(CNO)
to
enhance
VTA dopamine neuron firing selectively in males and dioestrus
females (Fig. 5a)48,49. We find that oestrus females, compared with
dioestrus females and males release two times more dopamine to
single-pulse tonic stimulations in the NAc (Fig. 5b,c). However,
when VTA dopamine neuron firing is chemogenetically increased
specifically during dioestrus, dopamine release was increased
compared with control dioestrus females and males, and not
different from oestrus females (Fig. 5b,c). Furthermore, enhancing
basal VTA firing is sufficient to increase male and dioestrus female’s
responsivity to phasic stimulation parameters to match those of
oestrus females (Fig. 5b,d).
The ability of cocaine to inhibit DAT (apparent Km) and
elevate dopamine levels is increased in oestrus females (Fig. 5e–g).
When excitatory DREADDs are used to enhance selectively VTA
dopamine neuron firing in dioestrus females and males, the
ability of cocaine to inhibit DAT is increased to the levels of
oestrus females (Fig. 5f,g). CNO alone in mice that did not
express DREADDs did not affect any of these measures, further
highlighting that the effects were due to DREADD-induced
increases in VTA activity (Supplementary Fig. 16). This is
concomitant with a threefold increase in the affinity for cocaine to
bind to DAT (Fig. 4g). These data demonstrate that enhancement
of VTA firing is sufficient to induce changes in protein function
that
alter
substrate
binding.
In
addition,
cocaine-induced
dopamine release is increased in oestrus females. Thus, increasing
VTA
firing
during
dioestrus
recapitulates
both
the
basal
dopamine function and effects of cocaine seen during oestrus.
To determine whether the increased VTA dopamine activity
associated with the oestrus cycle is causal to enhanced reward
processing, we increased VTA dopamine activity in TH-BAC-Cre
male, dioestrus female and oestrus female mice during cocaine
conditioning using excitatory DREADDs (Fig. 5h). The formation
of CPP in CNO-treated dioestrus females and males is increased
to levels similar of oestrus females (Fig. 5i). However, when
this same experiment was done in oestrus females, CNO was
not able to further potentiate cocaine CPP. This provides
additional support for the idea that downstream changes
in reward processing and CPP are mediated by activity-
dependent alterations in dopaminergic projections from the
VTA to the NAc (Fig. 6).
Discussion
We define a mechanism by which a selective increase in drug
potency during oestrus leads to long-lasting associations that
enhance drug responses in female mice even outside of the
oestrus phase. First, we identify a mechanism for the enhanced
cocaine reward exhibited in oestrus females by showing that
cocaine affinity for DAT is enhanced during oestrus. Levels
of circulating estradiol were correlated with cocaine potency
highlighting its role in the process. This enhances dopaminergic
responses to both cocaine and reward cues, leading to VTA-NAc
responses to the environmental cues alone, in the absence of drug,
even at later stages in the oestrous cycle. Second, we determined
the mechanism by which the DAT is altered to have a higher
affinity for cocaine binding. Oestrous cycle-dependent enhance-
ment of VTA firing leads to activity-dependent changes at
the level of DAT that enhanced cocaine potency and subsequent
cue-reward associations for cocaine. This enhanced dopaminergic
function paired with enhanced cocaine action directly at its site
of action lead to potent and long-lasting associations between
drugs and associated cues that likely enhance motivation, drug-
seeking and relapse, even in the absence of drug. Together, these
data provide a basic mechanism whereby increased VTA firing
drives adaptations to DAT that increase cocaine potency at DAT
and increase cocaine reward.
Previous work using anaesthetized in vivo voltammetry and
microdialysis has shown that cocaine increases extracellular
dopamine levels to a greater extent in oestrus females as
compared with females in dioestrus; however, the mechanism
for this effect was unclear and was suggested to be mediated
selectively via effects on dopamine release50. Here we show that
these increases in cocaine’s ability to increase dopamine levels in
reward-related brain regions are due to an increase in cocaine’s
ability to bind to and inhibit DAT. Although dopamine release
was also increased, a finding that is consistent with a large body of
previous work, we found that the enhanced release was not
predictive of changes in cocaine’s ability to inhibit uptake; thus,
the two phenomena were dissociable. Further, the magnitude of
cocaine’s effects on the dopamine system was predictive of CPP,
showing that this enhanced ability to inhibit DAT probably leads
to increased associations between the rewarding properties
of cocaine and the contextual cues that predicted its availability.
These data could also explain the increased acquisition and
drug consumption that is seen during oestrus in animals
voluntarily self-administering cocaine51,52.
As the effects we observed were oestrous cycle dependent,
we hypothesized that they were driven by circulating levels of
ovarian hormones. To this end, we determined serum levels of
estradiol and progesterone within each subject and found that the
increase in cocaine potency at DAT was highly correlated with
estradiol,
but
not
progesterone
levels.
Previous
work
in
ovariectomized rodents has shown that systemic delivery of
estradiol, but not progesterone, increases cocaine consumption

effects occur53,54. Further, we determined where these hormone-
induced changes in cocaine potency on dopamine terminals
originated. We bath applied estradiol directly to slices containing
the NAc. These coronal slices contained dopamine nerve
terminals originating in the VTA, but disconnected from their
associated VTA cell bodies. We found that estradiol did not
affect baseline dopamine nerve terminal function or cocaine
potency in any of the groups tested, suggesting that the changes in
the function of the dopamine terminal originated upstream.
The hypothesis that upstream changes at the level of the
cell body in the VTA drive this process was supported by data
showing that enhancement of VTA activity via DREADDs
was able to change the dopamine terminal and enhance cocaine
reward in male and dioestrus female mice. Thus, together
we hypothesize that during oestrus increases in VTA firing lead
to
downstream,
activity-dependent
signalling
that
alters
DAT.
Increasing
VTA
dopamine
activity
via
excitatory
DREADDs increased both the affinity of cocaine for DAT and
the formation of CPP in males and dioestrus females. We found
that these changes in cocaine effects at DAT were concomitant
with increased DAT phosphorylation at Thr53. In fact, Thr53
phosphorylation has been linked to both activity-dependent
changes in uptake function and alterations in stimulant efficacy at
the transporter34. Increasing ERK activity leads to Thr53
phosphorylation,
enhanced
uptake
rates
and
enhanced
stimulant effects at the DAT36–40. Further, previous work has
shown that cellular depolarization and activity is sufficient to
increase ERK activity55, providing a link between enhanced DAT
phosphorylation, and increases neuronal activity. Indeed, here we
show
that
during
oestrus
phosphorylated
ERK
levels
are
increased, and that this increase is directly correlated with
DAT phosphorylation at Thr53. Further work is needed to
establish causal connections between Thr53 phosphorylation and
oestrous cycle-dependent fluctuations in reward processing.
One important finding to support this hypothesis was the lack
of further increases in cocaine potency in oestrus females
expressing excitatory DREADDs. The occlusion of activity-
dependent changes in cocaine effects was observed not only at
the level of the dopamine terminal, but also in regard to the
development of CPP. Although this is not definitive proof, this
occlusion strongly suggests that these two effects are probably
occurring through similar molecular mechanisms.
Further, these data are important, because these molecular
adaptations drive strong cue-reward associations that extend past
the oestrus stage. Thus, it seems that when the cues are associated
may play a large role in determining the subsequent response to
cues. The ability to associate rewards with cues that predict their
availability is critical to survival, as these cues can result
in the motivation to obtain rewards such as food and underlie
the
motivation
to
reproduce41.
However,

processes,
with
associative
learning contributing not only to the increased motivation to
administer drugs of abuse such as cocaine, but also to relapse in
both humans and animal models44,45. Greater cocaine effects on
this pathway are associated with the compulsive drug-seeking and
taking that develops over time and characterizes an addicted
state56. Results of the present study show that oestrous cycle-
dependent enhancement of reward circuitry and cocaine effects

(1) The VTA to NAc pathway comprises dopaminergic neurons (purple) and other neuronal subpopulations (grey). (2) Dopamine neuron firing is enhanced
during oestrus. (3) The increased activity of this pathway leads to downstream ERK activation and concomitant phosphorylation of Thr53 (blue) on DAT.
(4) These changes in DAT lead to alterations in cocaine affinity, whereby cocaine is more able to bind to DAT and increase extracellular dopamine levels.
This increased cocaine binding leads to increased dopamine levels in the NAc. (5) In vivo this drives increased associations between cocaine and contextual
cues, which leads to enhanced cocaine CPP due to differences in the perceived rewarding value of cocaine.

 directly
on
this
system
lead
to
potent
and
long-lasting
associations between the rewarding effects of cocaine and the
environmental cues that predict its availability and the activity-
dependent mechanism by which this occurs.
Together, we propose a mechanism by which oestrous
cycle-dependent fluctuations in estradiol lead to increases in
VTA activity, which increases ERK activity and leads to
conformational changes in DAT via Thr53 phosphorylation
(Fig. 6). These changes in DAT enhance cocaine’s ability to
inhibit
its
uptake
function
and
augment
cocaine-induced
elevations in dopamine levels. In turn, these enhanced dopami-
nergic responses increase the rewarding properties of cocaine and
enhance the cue-reward associations that are formed as a result.
These associations are strong enough that the cues, in the absence
of cocaine, elicit dopaminergic responses and drive animals
to seek the reward (that is, cocaine) that was previously associated
with them. These associations, which are stronger in females
during oestrus, could lead to the precipitation of relapse even
after periods of abstinence.
More broadly, we have defined a basic mechanism whereby
enhanced activity of a pathway can lead to alterations in protein
function that enhance reward processing. In humans, people with
anxiety and depression are two times more likely to have
problems with drugs of abuse. Accordingly, previous work in
animals has shown that mice that are susceptible to developing
depressive-like behaviours have enhanced VTA excitability and
firing rates, as well as increased responses to stimulant drugs of
abuse. Thus, this work has implications for not only drug
addiction but also a number of psychiatric disorders and may
underlie the comorbidity of disorders such as anxiety and
depression with drug addiction. Taken together, our findings
reveal novel sex-specific factors controlling reward processing
and are critical to guiding evidence-based therapeutic interven-
tions for females.
Methods
Animals. Male and female 6- to 8-week-old C57BL/6J and TH-BAC-Cre mice were
maintained on a 12 h light–dark cycle at 22–25 �C with ad libitum access to food
and water. C57BL/6J wild-type mice were obtained from Jackson Laboratories
(Bar Harbor, MN; SN: 000664). TH-BAC-Cre mice from GENSTAT were bred and
maintained by the Center for Comparative Medicine and Science staff at Icahn
School of Medicine at Mount Sinai Mice until transfer for experimental use.
All mice were housed three to five per cage. Female mice were subjected to daily
vaginal smears and vaginal cytology was conducted to determine oestrous cycle
phase. All experiments were conducted in accordance with the guidelines of the
Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee at Icahn School of Medicine at
Mount Sinai, which approved and supervised all animal protocols. Experimenters
were blind to experimental group and order of testing was counterbalanced during
behavioural experiments.
Drugs. CNO (Sigma-Aldrich) was dissolved at a concentration of 2.5 mg ml � 1
in 5% dimethyl sulfoxide in normal saline (Sigma-Aldrich). CNO was administered
in the following dose of 1 mg kg � 1, i.p. An equal (matched) volume of vehicle
(saline with 5% dimethyl sulfoxide) was used as the control. Cocaine HCl was
provided by the NIDA drug supply programme and administered at a 10 mg kg � 1
doses i.p. For slice voltammetry experiments, Cocaine (NIDA Drug Supply),
Quinpirole (Sigma-Aldrich) and Estradiol (Sigma-Aldrich) were perfused over
slices in artificial cerebrospinal fluid (aCSF) solution.
Viral constructs. For general GCaMP expression in VTA neuronal populations,
GCaMP6f was cloned into the adeno-associated virus (AAV) vector,
AAVdj-CaMKIIa-GCaMP6f-WPRE. For dopamine-specific GCaMP expression
in TH( þ ) populations of the VTA, cre-inducible (DIO) GCaMP6f was cloned into
the AAV vector, AAVdj-DIO-EF1a-GCaMP6f-WPRE, and injected into the
VTA of TH-BAC-Cre mice. For DREADD experiments in dopamine populations
of the VTA, TH-BAC-Cre animals were injected with AAV2-hSyn-DIO-hM3Dq-
mCherry that was purchased from the viral core at the University of North
Carolina, Chapel Hill.
Stereotaxic virus injection and optic fiber implantation. Under ketamine
(100 mg kg � 1)/xylazine (10 mg kg � 1) anaesthesia, mice were positioned
in a stereotaxic frame (Kopf Instruments) and the VTA was targeted
(Bregma coordinates: anterior/posterior, � 3.3 mm; medial/lateral, 0.75 mm;
dorsal/ventral, � 4.6 mm; 7� angle). Ophthalmic ointment was applied to the eyes
to prevent drying. A midline incision was made down the scalp and a craniotomy
was made using a dental drill. A 10 ml Nanofil Hamilton syringe (WPI, Sarasota,
FL) with a 34-gauge beveled metal needle was used to infuse 0.5 ml virus at a rate
of 100 nl min � 1. Following infusion, the needle was kept at the injection site
for 10 min and then slowly withdrawn. Chronically implantable optic fibres
constructed with 400 mm core 0.48 numerical aperture (NA) optic fibre and
unilaterally implanted into the VTA (Bregma coordinates: anterior/posterior,
� 3.3 medial/lateral, þ 1.0; dorsal/ventral, � 4.4; 7� angle) and NAc
(bregma coordinates: anterior/posterior, 1.4 mm; medial/lateral, 1.5 mm;
dorsal/ventral, � 4.3 mm; 10� angle), and were cemented to the skull using
dental acrylic (Grip Cement Dentsply). For robust viral expression, viral infusions
and implantation occurred a minimum of 4–6 weeks before recordings.
Conditioned place preference. Daily oestrous cycle staging was conducted
1.5 h before experiments. All mice were acclimated to the behaviour room for at
least 1 h before testing. CPP was performed in a rectangular apparatus consisting of
two side chambers measuring 28 � 24 cm each and a centre chamber measuring
11.5 � 24 cm. One side had black and white stripes on the walls with a metal grid
floor and the other had grey walls with a punched metal floor. An unbiased CPP
paradigm was used in the current study. On Day 1, mice were allowed to explore
the entire apparatus for 20 min. On days 2 and 3, mice were confined to one of the
side chambers and injected with cocaine or saline. Side pairings were counter-
balanced across animals. On Day 5, during the choice test, mice were again allowed
to freely explore the entire apparatus. Preference was determined by a difference
score (time spent in paired � time spent in unpaired chamber). For calcium
imaging during conditioning or during choice tests, a 3 m-long fibre-optic patch-
cord (Doric Lenses) was connected to the chronically implanted optical fiber with a
zirconia sheath and was suspended above the behavioural testing environment, to
allow animals to move freely during stimulation. Noldus software running Etho-
vision 10.0 recorded behavioural outputs.
CPP with DREADD-induced excitation of VTA dopamine neurons. To deter-
mine whether basal increases in VTA firing were sufficient to enhance reward
processing, AAV-DIO-hM3Dq was injected into the VTA of TH-BAC-Cre mice.
The virus was allowed to express for 5 weeks and then the animals went through
CPP as described above. CNO (1 mg kg � 1; Sigma) was administered 2 h before
cocaine pairing sessions. Time spent in each area of the conditioning chamber was
recorded as before and animals were considered to have developed a preference
when the difference in time spent between the drug paired and chamber paired
with saline was significantly greater than before the pairings.
In vivo anaesthetized single-unit recordings. In vivo extracellular, single-unit
recordings to determine basal activity of VTA dopamine neurons of anaesthetized
intact mice were conducted following published methods57. Male and oestrus and
dioestrus female mice were anaesthetized with 8% chloral hydrate (400 mg kg � 1,
i.p.) and head fixed to a stereotaxic frame. The skull was exposed to identify
bregma and coordinates were measured to determine VTA location where a skull
window was created (anterior/posterior, � 2.92B � 3.88; medial/lateral
±0.25B0.96; and DV ¼ � 3.5B � 4.5). Extracellular single-unit signals were
amplified using a DP-311 Differential Amplifier and filtered (0.3–1 kHz band pass).
Voltage data were acquired using an Axon Digidata Data Acquisition System,
sampled using 16-bit resolution at 32 kHz and stored using pCLAMP for further
offline analysis.
Single-unit recordings data analysis. Putative dopamine cells in the VTA were
identified according to standard electrophysiological criteria: a stark, triphasic
waveform with set filters; action potential duration from start to negative trough
Z1.1 ms; slow firing rate (o10 spikes per second); and bursting behaviour with
onset beginning when two spikes occurred within o80 ms and offset set when
no activity occurred for Z160 ms58. Spike times were measured using Clampfit
10.2 and data were further processed using R as previously described59. Activity
was quantified by overlapping 60 s windows shifted every 15 s. Percentage of spikes
within bursts corresponds to the percentage of spikes discharged within a burst.
Further, burst length was determined after measuring the number of spikes within
a burst and averaged per cell.
Fast-scan cyclic voltammetry. Ex vivo FSCV was used to characterize D2/D3
autoreceptor function, DAT activity, dopamine release and cocaine potency in
the NAc. Voltammetry experiments were conducted 1–2 weeks following the
completion of the CPP experiments. Recordings were made directly at the end of
the fiberoptic probe, to ensure that the recordings were from the same location in
the NAc as calcium-imaging experiments. A vibrating tissue slicer was used to
prepare 250 mm-thick coronal brain sections containing the NAc, which were
immersed in oxygenated aCSF containing (in mM): NaCl (126), KCl (2.5),
NaH2PO4 (1.2), CaCl2 (2.4), MgCl2 (1.2), NaHCO3 (25), glucose (11), L-ascorbic

 acid (0.4) and pH was adjusted to 7.4. The slice was transferred to the testing
chambers containing aCSF at 32 �C with a 1 ml min � 1 flow rate. A carbon
fibre microelectrode (100–200 mM length, 7 mM radius) and bipolar stimulating
electrode were placed into the NAc where GCaMP-GFP terminal expression was
high and near the optic fibre track to get the best representation of release near
the recorded regions. Dopamine release was evoked by a single electrical pulse
(300 mA, 4 ms, monophasic) applied to the tissue every 5 min. The extracellular
dopamine level was recorded by applying a triangular waveform ( � 0.4 to þ 1.2, to
� 0.4 V versus Ag/AgCl, 400 mV s � 1). Once the peak of evoked dopamine release
was stabilized (three collections with o10% variability), the amount of evoked
dopamine release and a maximal rate of uptake (Vmax) were assessed. Subsequently,
tonic and phasic stimulations were applied to slices, to determine the responsivity
of VTA terminals in the NAc to tonic and phasic firing parameters. Tonic sti-
mulations consisted of one pulse stimulations. Phasic stimulations consisted of five
pulses at either 5, 10 or 20 Hertz. These stimulation parameters were selected based
on the physiological firing properties of VTA dopamine neurons in vivo.
To assess autoreceptor function, quinpirole, a D2/D3 receptor agonist, was
applied cumulatively to the brain slice, to determine a concentration–response
curve (0.01–1 mM) to assess quinpirole effects on dopamine release. In a slice
preparation, presynaptic autoreceptors are dissociated from postsynaptic D2
receptors. As quinpirole activates autoreceptors, evoked dopamine release is
reduced. The resulting concentration–response curve is then fit to determine the
IC50 of quinpirole in each condition. Increases in autoreceptor sensitivity increase
the IC50 of qunipirole on dopamine release.
To determine cocaine potency, cocaine was applied cumulatively to brain slices.
Once the extracellular dopamine response was stable, cocaine (0.03–30 mmol l � 1)
was applied and resulting current versus time plots were analysed at each
concentration, to determine the ability of cocaine to inhibit DAT and elevate
synaptic dopamine levels.
To determine the local effects of estradiol on NAc brain slices, estradiol was
bath applied at 1 or 3 mM. Recordings were taken for 60 min at each dose, to ensure
that estradiol had sufficient time to induce changes. Once dopamine measurements
were stable, a concentration response curve for cocaine was run (0.1–30 mmol l � 1)
within each group.
Recording electrodes were calibrated by recording responses (in electrical
current; nA) to a known concentration of dopamine (3 mM) using a flow-injection
system. This was used to convert an electrical current to a dopamine concentration.
Voltammetric data analysis. Demon voltammetry and analysis software was used
for all analysis of FSCV data60. Data were modelled using Michaelis–Menten
kinetics to determine dopamine release, Vmax and cocaine potency. The quinpirole
concentration–response curves were assessed by determining the peak height of
dopamine release at each dose and expressed as a percentage of the pre-drug basal
dopamine release.
To evaluate dopamine kinetics and drug potency, evoked levels of dopamine
were modelled using Michaelis–Menten kinetics. Apparent Km (App. Km), a
measure of the ability of a drug to inhibit dopamine clearance, was used to evaluate
changes in cocaine potency. App. Km was determined from the decreased affinity of
dopamine (Km) for the DAT. As the ability of DAT to clear dopamine is decreased
(following application of cocaine), the extent to which this occurs can be calculated.
The decreased affinity of dopamine (Km) for DAT is then used to determine an
App. Km of the drug for the transporter. For cocaine concentration–response
curves, App. Km, a measure of apparent affinity for the DAT, was used to
determine changes in ability of the cocaine to inhibit dopamine uptake. As App.
Km increases, uptake inhibition increases and changes in drug potency are seen as
shifts in the curve.
Inhibition constants (Ki) were determined by plotting the linear concentration-
effect profiles and determining the slope of the linear regression. The Ki was
calculated by the equation Km/slope. Ki values are reported in mM and are a
measure of the drug concentration that is necessary to produce 50% uptake
inhibition. Ki is a measure of the actual drug affinity for the DAT in concentration
of drug, whereas Km is a dopamine-related parameter that estimates uptake
inhibition.
Blood collection. Trunk blood was collected in LoBind tubes on day of FSCV
recordings. Blood was allowed to clot at room temperature for one hour and
centrifuged at 2,500 r.c.f. at 4 �C, to separate serum and erythrocytes. Serum was
stored at � 20 �C until day of analysis.
Enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. ELISA kits for estradiol and progesterone
(Cayman Chemical) were used to measure serum samples from oestrus and
dioestrus females and males. Blood samples were taken immediately before
FSCV recordings. The appropriate estradiol or progesterone standards of the
manufacturer, and negative and positive controls were run on each plate. A 10 ml
aliquot of diluted samples was pipetted manually into the plate wells in duplicate.
The ELISA assays were then run according to the instructions of the manu-
facturers. The samples were incubated in microplate wells coated with fixed
amounts of oriented high-affinity purified polyclonal antibody and the mixture was
incubated at room temperature for 60 min in the dark. After incubation, the
plate was washed six times with deionized H2O, to remove any unbound sample
or drug–enzyme conjugate. The chromogenic substrate was then added (100 ml per
well) and the plate was incubated for 30 min in the dark. After substrate incubation,
the reaction was halted with the addition of an acid-based stop solution (100 ml per
well). The plate was read using a Spectra max plus plate reader equipped with a
450 nm filter (Molecular Devices).
FSCV with DREADD-induced excitation of VTA dopamine neurons. To
determine whether basal increases in VTA firing were sufficient to alter basal
dopamine system function, AAV-DIO-hM3Dq-mCherry was injected into the
VTA of male and female TH-BAC-Cre mice. The virus was allowed to express for
5 weeks. Vaginal cytology was done starting 2 weeks before the voltammetry
experiments, to determine the cycle stage of the animals. For all groups DREADDs
were expressed in VTA dopamine neurons and activated with CNO (1 mg kg � 1).
Vaginal cytology was done before FSCV recordings, to confirm cycle stage on day
of recording.
Fibre photometry calcium imaging. Fibre photometry uses the same optic fibre to
both excite and record from the genetically encoded calcium indicator GCaMP6f in
real time and thus can allow for temporally precise measurements of neuronal
activity that can then be time-locked to a specific behavioural output26,27,42. Our
fibre photometry system used two LEDs at 490 and 405 (Thor Labs), reflected off
dichroic mirrors (Semrock, FF495) and coupled into a 400 mm 0.48 NA optical
fibre (Thorlabs BFH48–600, important for minimal autofluorescence and signal
recovery) using a 40 � 0.48 NA microscope objective (Olympus) and fibre launch
(Thorlabs), with the patchcord linked to an implanted 400 mm optical fibre with
zirconia sheath. The LED intensity at the interface between the fibre tip and the
animal ranged from 30 to 75 mW (but was constant across trials and over days).
The power output of the system was tested with a power meter at the start of each
experimental session. A real-time signal processor (RX8, Tucker-Davis
Technologies, Alachua FL), running software that was custom designed using
OpenEx, sinusoidally modulated each laser’s output. The two output signals were
projected onto a photodetector (Model 2151 Femtowatt Photoreceiver, Newport,
Irvine, CA) after which they were separated for analysis. Signals were collected at a
sampling frequency of 381 Hz.
Fibre photometry analysis. Analysis of the signal was accomplished with custom-
written MatLab software42. The bulk fluorescent signals from each channel were
normalized, to compare across animals and experimental sessions. The 405 channel
was used as the control channel. GCaMP signals that are recorded at this
wavelength are not calcium dependent; thus, changes in signal can be attributed to
autofluorescence, bleaching and fibre bending. Accordingly, any fluctuations that
occurred in the 405 nm control channels were removed from the 490 nm channel
before analysis.
To do this, both signals were first filtered at 40 Hz. A least-squares linear fit was
applied to the 405 nm control signal, to align it to the 490 nm signal. The DF/F was
then calculated for each behavioral session as: (490 nm signal � fitted 405 nm
signal)/(fitted 405 nm signal). We calculated a single baseline fluorescence value,
either as the median of the entire trace (which robustly estimated the baseline
fluorescence) or by manually defining the baseline during visually identified
periods of rest. We calculated the normalized change in fluorescence (DF/F) by
subtracting the baseline fluorescence from the fibre fluorescence at each time point
and dividing that value by the baseline fluorescence. Peak reward DF/F was
calculated as the maximum DF/F value in the paired chamber in a 10 s period
around the entry. It is important to note that this window is only applied around
trials where the animal is facing the chamber and subsequently enters the chamber.
Behavioural variables, such as paired and unpaired chamber entries, were
marked in the signalling traces via the real-time processor as electrical pulses from
Noldus Ethovision software. This allowed for precise determinations of the
temporal profile of signals in relation to paired and unpaired chamber entries. For
each mouse, the time at which the animal entered the drug-paired chamber was
determined and a 5 s window around that point was analysed. We subsequently
determined the maximum or minimum fluorescent signal that occurred within that
window over both consecutive entries and across behavioural tasks/sessions.
Peak analysis to determine frequency and amplitude of the signals was carried
out by determining the median average deviation of the corrected/normalized data
set and peaks were identified as events that exceeded the median average deviation
by 2.91 deviations.
Western blot hybridization. Bilateral 14-gauge NAc punches were collected on
ice after rapid decapitation and then immediately placed on dry ice and stored at
� 80 �C until use. Protein concentrations of whole-cell lysates were determined
using a DC protein assay (Bio-Rad). Within each fraction, equal amounts of
protein were mixed with reducing sample buffer containing SDS and dithiothreitol,
and samples heated to 95 �C for 5 min. Samples were separated by molecular
weight using SDS–PAGE with Criterion 4–15% Tris-HCl, 1.0 mm precast gels
(Bio-Rad) and proteins transferred onto Immobilon-P 0.45 mm pore side
membranes (Millipore) at 100 V for 1 h at 4 �C in SDS-free transfer buffer
containing 15% methanol. Membranes were blocked in Tris-buffered saline

 containing 5% BSA and 0.1% Tween-20 for 1 h at room temperature and
membranes incubated with a polyclonal primary antibody to DAT
(Millipore AB2231; 1:1,000), pDAT (Abcam ab28; 1:1,000), TH (Abcam ab112;
1:1,000), pS40 TH (Abcam ab51206; 1:1,000), Erk1/2 (cell signaling 4695S; 1:1,000)
or pERK1/2 (Cell Signaling 4370; 1:1,000) in blocking solution overnight at 4 �C.
Membranes then were incubated with a peroxidase-conjugated secondary antibody
(goat anti-rabbit, Jackson Immunoresearch; 1:50,000) in blocking solution at room
temperature for 2 h, washed and developed using chemiluminescent substrate
(Thermo Scientific). The amount of protein expressed in each lane was quantified
by densitometry using Image J (US National Institutes of Health). Actin levels were
used to normalize measurements. For DAT, two bands (at 75 and 55 kDA) are
obtained due to different glycosylation states of the mature protein. Each band was
quantified separately and the ratio of the 75 kDA band to the 55 kDA band was
compared. Images in Fig. 2 and Supplementary Figs 3 and 13 have been cropped
for presentation. Full size images are presented in Supplementary Fig. 17.
Statistics. Graph Pad Prism (version 6, La Jolla, CA, USA) or R were used to
statistically analyse data sets and create graphs. Normality of data was assessed
and, when data were not normally distributed, non-parametric analyses were
performed. Data for CPP across oestrous cycle, VTA dopamine neuron percent
spikes within a burst, voltammetrically recorded dopamine release, cocaine effects
during fibre photometry recordings, cocaine affinity measurements (Ki), VTA
contextual cue responses, baseline VTA activity as measured via fibre photometry,
cycle-dependent changes in uptake rates and cycle-dependent changes in Km were
analysed by a one-way analysis of variance with Tukey’s post-hoc test. Data of VTA
dopamine neuron in vivo firing rate, VTA dopamine neuron burst length and NAc
contextual cue-responses were analysed using a Kruskal–Wallis w2-test because of
non-normal distributions followed by Wilcoxon test. Data for phasic stimulations
responses across groups, quinpirole concentration response curves, cocaine-
induced inhibition of VTA and NAc activity using fibre photometry, cocaine
concentration–response curves, cocaine-induced dopamine release and effects of
estradiol and CNO during FSCV recordings were analysed by a two-way analysis of
variance with Bonferroni post-hoc test. Initial male versus female comparisons for
CPP and basal VTA electrophysiology were compared using a Student’s t-test.
Correlational analyses were used to compare CPP difference score with cocaine
effects in the VTA and NAc, contextual-cue response with difference score and
maximal rate of uptake with cocaine affinity (Ki). P-levels o0.05 were considered
to be statistically significant for all data.

study are available within the paper and its Supplementary Information files.
