P
ost-transcriptional modification of mRNA has emerged as an 
important mechanism for gene regulation. Among internal 
mRNA modifications, m6A is by far the most abundant, tagging 
over 10,000 mRNAs and long noncoding RNAs1,2. It is a reversible 
modification, and both methyltranferases and demethylases have 
been reported. In 2014, we and others reported that Mettl3 and 
Mettl14 formed a heterodimer and served as core components of 
m6A methyltransferase3,4. Both Mettl3 and Mettl14 are required for 
m6A formation: in the heterodimer, Mettl3 is the enzymatic subunit 
and Mettl14 is required for RNA substrate recognition and mainte-
nance of proper Mettl3 conformation5–7.
The functional role of m6A in gene expression regulation has 
been studied extensively8, but its importance in development at 
organismal levels remains largely unknown. Recently, two studies 
reported that children born with homozygous missense mutations 
in the gene FTO (fat mass and obesity-associated protein), which 
encodes an m6A demethylase9, display severe neurodevelopmental 
disorders, including microcephaly, functional brain deficits and 
psychomotor delay, suggesting an essential, yet unexplored, role 
of m6A RNA modification in brain development10,11. To investigate 
potential m6A function in early neuronal development, we deleted 
Mettl14 in mouse embryonic NSCs, as self-renewing and multipo-
tent NSCs give rise to the entire brain, and defects in NSC activities 
have been shown to underlie various neurodevelopmental disor-
ders12. In vitro, NSCs lacking Mettl14 displayed robust decreases in 
proliferation accompanied by premature differentiation, suggesting 
that m6A is required for NSC self-renewal. Consistent with this, in 
vivo analysis in Mettl14-null embryos revealed that NSCs, which 
are also known as radial glial cells (RGCs), in the ventricular zone 
(VZ) showed a decrease in number relative to those seen in control 
mice, and this reduction was accompanied by fewer late-born corti-
cal neurons. Mechanistically, we observed a genome-wide increase 
in specific histone modifications in Mettl14-knockout (KO) NSCs. 
Notably, gene-by-gene analysis suggested that those changes were 
correlated with changes in gene expression and observed develop-
mental phenotypes, suggesting that m6A-regulated histone modi-
fication underlies alterations in NSC gene expression and activity. 
Finally, we present evidence that m6A regulation of histone modi-
fication alters the stability of mRNAs encoding histone modifiers. 
Overall, our results show, for the first time, a key role for mRNA 
modification in NSCs and brain development.
Results
Mettl14 knockout decreases NSC proliferation and promotes 
premature NSC differentiation in vitro. To assess Mettl14 loss of 
function in vivo, we generated Mettl14–conditional knockout mice 
(Mettl14f/f) by flanking Mettl14 exon 2 with loxP sites. Cre-mediated 
exon 2 excision results in an out-of-frame mutation that abolishes 
Mettl14 function (Supplementary Fig. 1a,b). To assess whether the 
KO strategy deletes Mettl14 in vivo, we evaluated whether Mettl14 
was deleted globally using EIIa-cre transgenic mice, which express 
Cre at zygotic stages (Supplementary Fig. 1c,d). Mettl14+/− hetero-
zygotes were viable and fertile and exhibited no discernible mor-
phological or growth abnormalities, whereas no Mettl14−/− offspring 
were observed after crosses of Mettl14+/− mice (Supplementary 
Table 1). We then collected embryos resulting from crosses of 
 
heterozygotes at embryonic day 7.5 (E7.5), E8.5 and E9.5 for genotyp-
ing. Mettl14−/− embryos were identified at Mendelian ratios when we

Internal N6-methyladenosine (m6A) modification is widespread in messenger RNAs (mRNAs) and is catalyzed by heterodimers 
of methyltransferase-like protein 3 (Mettl3) and Mettl14. To understand the role of m6A in development, we deleted Mettl14 
in embryonic neural stem cells (NSCs) in a mouse model. Phenotypically, NSCs lacking Mettl14 displayed markedly decreased 
proliferation and premature differentiation, suggesting that m6A modification enhances NSC self-renewal. Decreases in the 
NSC pool led to a decreased number of late-born neurons during cortical neurogenesis. Mechanistically, we discovered a 
genome-wide increase in specific histone modifications in Mettl14 knockout versus control NSCs. These changes correlated 
with altered gene expression and observed cellular phenotypes, suggesting functional significance of altered histone modi-
fications in knockout cells. Finally, we found that m6A regulates histone modification in part by destabilizing transcripts that 
encode histone-modifying enzymes. Our results suggest an essential role for m6A in development and reveal m6A-regulated 
histone modifications as a previously unknown mechanism of gene regulation in mammalian cells.

combined genotyping results from all three stages (Supplementary 
Table 2). But most Mettl14−/− embryos were dead and many had 
regressed (Supplementary Fig. 1e), indicating that Mettl14 activity 
is required for early embryogenesis, a phenotype similar to that of 
global Mettl3-KO mice13. Of seven Mettl14−/− embryos identified at 
either E7.5 or E8.5, four were male and three were female, suggesting 
that phenotypes were not gender specific (Supplementary Fig. 1f).
We then assessed the potential effects of Mettl14 deletion in 
NSCs. To do so, we crossed Mettl14f/f mice with a Nestin-Cre trans-
genic line to generate Mettl14f/f;Nestin-Cre (Mettl14-cKO) mice and 
littermate controls, including Mettl14f/+;Nestin-cre(heterozygous) 
and Mettl14f/f (non-deleted) mice. Newborn pups were alive and 
showed no overt morphologic phenotypes (Supplementary Fig. 1g) 
and normal body weight (Supplementary Fig. 1h). However,

all Mettl14-cKO mice were dead within the first neonatal week 
(Supplementary Fig. 1i). When we examined the brains of post-
natal day 0 (P0) Mettl14-cKO pups, we observed no anomalies in 
gross anatomy, but we found moderately reduced cortical length 
(Fig. 1a,b). Hematoxylin and eosin (H&E) staining of coronal 
 
sections of P0 mouse brain revealed enlargement of the ventricle and 
a 23% decrease in cortical thickness in Mettl14-cKO brains relative to 
littermate Mettl14f/f controls (Fig. 1c,d). We next examined Mettl14 
expression in RGCs by carrying out Mettl14 and Pax6 co-immunos-
taining on coronal sections of E17.5 brain from nondeleted, cKO and 
heterozygous mice. Mettl14 was readily detectible in Pax6+ cells in 
the cortex of nondeleted and heterozygous controls, but not in cKO 
mice (Fig. 1e). Together, these results suggest that Mettl14 is required 
for normal function of NSCs that serve as cortical progenitors.
Next, we evaluated m6A function in isolated embryonic NSCs cul-
tured in vitro. To determine which embryonic stages are appropriate

to select Mettl14-deficient NSCs, we examined Mettl14 protein 
expression in coronal sections prepared from E13.5, E15.5, E17.5 
and P0 brains from cKO, heterozygous and nondeleted control mice. 
Immunostaining revealed residual Mettl14 staining in the cerebral 
cortex at E13.5 in Mettl14-cKO brain, whereas Mettl14 signals in 
cortex were absent from E15.5 onward (Fig. 1f). Heterozygous mice 
showed Mettl14 signals comparable to those of nondeleted controls. 
Thus, for further analysis we chose E14.5 and E17.5 cortical NSCs 
and cultured them as neurospheres for 7 d before harvesting them 
for analysis.
We observed comparable phenotypes in subsequent in vitro anal-
ysis of E14.5 and E17.5 NSCs. Unless stated otherwise, our results 
are those of experiments conducted in E14.5 NSCs. Following 
confirmation of Mettl14 loss in KO NSCs by western blotting 
(Supplementary Fig. 2a), we assessed m6A levels from E14.5 neu-
rospheres. Thin-layer chromatography (TLC) analysis revealed an 
almost total loss of m6A in polyA RNA isolated from Mettl14-KO 
versus nondeleted NSCs, whereas heterozygous cells displayed m6A 
levels comparable to those seen in nondeleted controls (Fig. 2a), 
suggesting that the KO system that we generated is ideal for study-
ing m6A function in NSCs.
To characterize KO versus control NSCs, we used a Celigo image 
cytometer and software to image neurospheres and assess their 
number and size. Although Mettl14-KO, heterozygous and nonde-
leted control NSCs derived from E14.5 embryos formed a similar 
number of neurospheres, neurosphere size, as reflected by neuro-
sphere area in this system, decreased by ~55% in KO versus non-
deleted control cells, whereas neurosphere size from heterozygous 
cells was comparable to that seen in nondeleted controls (Fig. 2b,c). 
Consistently, those same Mettl14-KO NSCs exhibited significantly 
decreased proliferation, as determined by cell-counting analysis 
(Fig. 2d). Similar proliferation defects were detected in NSCs taken 
from E17.5 Mettl14-cKO mice (Supplementary Fig. 2b). Annexin 
V flow cytometry (Supplementary Fig. 2c,d) and TUNEL (termi-
nal deoxynucleotidyl transferase (TdT) dUTP nick-end labeling) 
analysis (Supplementary Fig. 2e) of E14.5 NSCs confirmed that the 
effects were not a result of increased apoptosis. To ensure that pro-
liferation defects were a result of Mettl14 deletion, we performed

rescue experiments by overexpressing Flag-tagged Mettl14 in E14.5 
KO NSCs. Western and dot blot analysis confirmed Mettl14 trans-
gene expression (Supplementary Fig. 2f) and the restoration of m6A 
(Supplementary Fig. 2g). Notably, Mettl14 overexpression did not 
increase the proliferation of nondeleted NSC controls (Fig. 2e), but 
increased the proliferation of Mettl14-KO NSCs to rates comparable 
to that of controls (Fig. 2e). These results suggest that Mettl14 and 
concomitant m6A RNA modification regulate NSC proliferation, at 
least in vitro.
It is well established that decreased NSC proliferation is coupled 
with premature NSC differentiation14. Thus, we checked for the 
presence of cells expressing the neuronal marker Tuj1 in E14.5 NSCs 
cultured for 7 d as neurospheres. Immunostaining analysis revealed 
a 6.2-fold increase in the number of Tuj1+ cells in KO versus control 
NSCs (Fig. 2f,g), whereas the number of Tuj1+ cells was comparable 
between heterozygous and nondeleted controls, suggesting that 
Mettl14 loss leads to premature neuronal differentiation. Together, 
these results suggest that Mettl14 regulates NSC self-renewal.
To determine whether the loss of an m6A demethylase would 
have the opposite effect on NSC proliferation, we knocked down two 
reported m6A demethylases, Fto and Alkbh59,15, separately in wild-
type NSCs. Reverse-transcription quantitative PCR (RT-qPCR) 
analysis showed high knockdown efficiency in each case, and west-
ern blots revealed a marked decrease in Fto and Alkbh5 protein lev-
els in the respective knockdown cells (Supplementary Fig. 2h,i,k,l). 
Nonetheless, NSC proliferation in vitro was not altered by the loss 
of either protein (Supplementary Fig. 2j,m). Some reports suggest 
that changes in expression of either Fto or Alkbh5 have only moder-
ate effects on m6A levels and that both factors likely regulate m6A 
modification of a subset of transcripts15–17. Our results suggest that 
mRNAs that function in NSC proliferation are not regulated by 
either Fto or Alkbh5.
The size of the cortical RGC pool is reduced in Mettl14-cKO mouse 
brain. We next examined the effect of Mettl14 on the proliferation 
of primary cortical stem cells or RGCs in vivo. To do so, we deter-
mined the number of S-phase cells in the cortex of E13.5, E15.5 or 
E17.5 Mettl14-cKO, heterozygous and nondeleted control embryos 
by injecting pregnant females with bromodeoxyuridine (BrdU) and 
harvesting embryos 0.5 h later, which detected only cells undergoing 
DNA replication at that time point. Immunostaining showed that 
the number of BrdU+ cells decreased by 19% in E15.5 Mettl14-cKO 
 
compared with nondeleted control brain (Supplementary Fig. 3a,d), 
and that number was 40% when analysis was conducted at E17.5 
(Fig. 3a,d). Similarly, we also observed a 44% and 45% decrease in 
the number of cells expressing the mitotic marker phospho-his-
tone H3 (PH3) at the apical membrane of the cortical VZ in cKO 
versus nondeleted control brain at E15.5 and E17.5, respectively 
(Supplementary Fig. 3b,d and Fig. 3b,d). To determine the number 
of RGCs, we assessed brain coronal sections at all three stages with 
the RGC marker Pax6. Consistently, we detected a 45% decrease 
in the number of Pax6+ RGCs in the VZ of E17.5 Mettl14-cKO 
 
brain versus controls (Fig. 3c,d) and a 14% decrease at E15.5 
(Supplementary Fig. 3c,d). All experiments showed highly compa-
rable results between heterozygous and nondeleted control RGCs 
(Fig. 3a–d and Supplementary Fig. 3a–d). We did not detect differ-
ences in BrdU, PH3 or Pax6 staining relative to that in nondeleted 
controls in the cortex of E13.5 Mettl14-cKO brains (Supplementary 
Fig. 3e–g), consistent with the finding that residual Mettl14 is pres-
ent in cortex at E13.5 (Fig. 1f). Immunostaining with the apopto-
sis marker cleaved caspase-3 revealed no change in the number 
of apoptotic cells in the cortex of E17.5 and E15.5 Mettl14-cKO 
brains relative to nondeleted controls (Supplementary Fig. 3h,i). To 
understand how Mettl14 loss might affect RGC proliferation, we 
examined cell cycle progression and cell cycle exit of RGCs from 
the brains of E15.5 and E17.5 Mettl14-cKO versus control mice. We 
carried out sequential 5-iodo-2ʹ-deoxyuridine (IdU) and BrdU 
injection to evaluate cell cycle progression, followed by IdU and 
BrdU double-staining of cortical sections18. We then determined the 
percentage of IdU+BrdU– cells, which represented the cells that had 
progressed past S-phase, versus all IdU+ cells, a group that included 
both proliferating cells and cells that had left S-phase. We detected 
a 38% and 43% decrease in E15.5 and E17.5 Mettl14-cKO embryos, 
respectively, compared with the nondeleted control, suggesting that 
Mettl14 loss disrupts normal RGC cell cycle progression (Fig. 3e–g). 
Heterozygous and nondeleted control RGCs yielded comparable 
results (Fig. 3e–g). To determine whether Mettl14 loss alters cell 
cycle exit, we performed BrdU-Ki67 double-staining of cortical 
sections from the brains of mice pulsed with BrdU and analyzed 
24 h later. Mettl14 loss resulted in a 50% and 39% decrease in cells 
exiting the cell cycle from E15.5 and E17.5 Mettl14-cKO embryos, 
respectively, versus nondeleted controls, suggesting that Mettl14 is 
required for normal RGC cell cycle exit (Fig. 3h–j). Heterozygous 
and nondeleted control RGCs yielded comparable results (Fig. 3h–j). 
 
Together, these data strongly suggest that Mettl14 regulates the RGC 
cell cycle and that the RGC pool in cortex is substantially reduced 
in Mettl14-cKO mice.
We then examined RGC premature differentiation in the cortical 
VZ of E15.5 and E17.5 Mettl14-cKO brains using Eomes (Tbr2), a 
marker of intermediate progenitor cells located at the sub-ventricular 
 
zone (SVZ), and the proneural marker Neurod2 (ND2). Notably, 
patches of ND2+Tbr2+ cells were seen consistently at E15.5 and 
E17.5 in areas close to the apical surface of the cortical VZ of 
Mettl14-cKO brain, but were absent in comparably staged littermate 
controls (Supplementary Fig. 3j,k and Fig. 3k,l). Together, these data 
suggest that Mettl14 is required to prevent NSC premature differen-
tiation and maintain the NSC pool in vivo.
Mettl14 deletion results in reduced numbers of late-born neu-
rons. We next evaluated the effects of Mettl14 loss on cortical neu-
rogenesis. In P0 mice, neurons differentiated from RGCs are found 
in six distinct cortical layers containing neuronal subtypes identi-
fiable by specific markers. Thus, we stained coronal sections from 
cKO and comparably staged littermate controls at P0 for the follow-
ing markers: Cux1, which is expressed in late-born neurons and is a 
marker of upper neuronal layers II–IV; Sox5, which is expressed in 
early-born neurons and is a marker of layer V; and Tbr1, which is 
expressed in postmitotic neurons and is a marker of layer VI to the 
subplate. Overall, layer organization was comparable in cKO and 
control mice. When we assessed layer thickness, the thickness of 
layers marked by Sox5 and Tbr1 did not differ significantly between 
genotypes (Fig. 4a,b). However, we observed a 70% decrease in the 
thickness of Cux1+ layers (II–IV) (Fig. 4a,b). To confirm the loss 
of neurons from these layers, we stained sections from P0 embryos 
for a different layer II–IV marker, Satb2, and observed an ~34% 
decrease in the number of Satb2+e neurons in cKO mice versus 
littermate controls (Fig. 4c,d). When we examined cortical Cux1 
staining at E17.5, we detected a 22% reduction in the thickness of 
Cux1+ layers and a 50% reduction in the number of newly gener-
ated Cux1+ cells residing in a region between the VZ and layer IV in 
Mettl14-cKO mice versus controls (Fig. 4e,f). These results suggest 
that Mettl14 loss may deplete the progenitor pool in a way that is 
reflected by loss of late-born neurons.
Mettl14 knockout leads to genome-wide changes in histone 
modification that perturb gene expression. To assess molecu-
lar mechanisms underlying m6A-regulated NSC activity, we 
cultured NSCs from E14.5 Mettl14-cKO, heterozygous and non-
deleted control embryos for 7 d and performed RNA sequencing 
(RNA-seq). Mettl14-KO NSCs exhibited distinct gene expression 
profiles relative to nondeleted and heterozygous controls (which 
showed comparable profiles; Fig. 5a and Supplementary Table 3).

Gene Ontology analysis (GO) suggested that the most significantly 
upregulated genes function in NSC differentiation, whereas down-
regulated genes are associated with cell proliferation (Fig. 5b,c and 
Supplementary Fig. 4a), changes that are reflective of observed 
phenotypes. We then evaluated potential mechanisms underlying 
these changes in gene expression. It is well established that m6A 
destabilizes transcripts4,13,19,20. However, we  detected only a weak 
correlation between m6A loss and increase in transcript abundance 
(Supplementary Fig. 4b, Supplementary Tables 3 and 4), suggest-
ing that different m6A-related mechanisms modulate mRNA levels. 
Given that modification of histone tails is a critical mechanism of 
gene regulation in mammalian cells21, we asked whether m6A RNA 
modification may also change histone modifications by performing 
western blotting on acid-extracted histones from KO versus control 
NSCs isolated at both E14.5 and E17.5. We evaluated a panel of well-
studied histone modifications that have been reported to regulate 
stem cell activities, including histone H3 phosphorylation, histone 
H2A and H2B ubiquitination, three types of histone acetylation, 
and four types of histone methylation22–33. These histone marks are 
associated with either gene activation or repression. Representative 
western blots of E14.5 NSCs are shown in Fig. 5d. We quantified 
western blots from E14.5 and E17.5 by calculating the ratios of 
respective histone modifications to total H3 protein in KO, hetero-
zygous and nondeleted control NSCs. Although we observed no 
significant change in any of the histone modifications that we tested 
between heterozygous and nondeleted control samples (Fig. 5d,e), 
we detected a significant increase in acetylation of histone H3 at 
lysine 27 (H3K27ac; 111% increase), trimethylation of histone H3 at 
lysine 4 (H3K4me3; 43% increase) and trimethylation of histone H3 
at lysine 27 (H3K27me3; 71% increase) in Mettl14-KO NSCs ver-
sus nondeleted controls (Fig. 5d,e). These results suggest that m6A 
regulates specific histone modifications.
To determine whether these changes alter NSC proliferation, 
we searched for chemical inhibitors that antagonize activities 
associated with upregulated histone modifications to determine 
whether inhibitor treatment of E14.5 KO NSCs would rescue cell 
proliferation defects. Three inhibitors were commercially avail-
able: MM102, which inhibits mixed-lineage leukemia (MLL) func-
tion and H3K4me3 formation; C646, which inhibits the H3K27 
acetyltransferase Crebbp (CBP)/p300 activity; and GSK343, which 
inhibits Ezh2-dependent H3K27me3 formation. We then seeded 
comparable numbers of NSCs of all three genotypes, added inhibi-
tor or DMSO vehicle at day 0, and determined cell number via MTT 
assays 4 d later. After DMSO treatment, the number of KO NSCs 
was ~50% that of nondeleted controls, reflecting slower prolifera-
tion, as anticipated (Fig. 5f). GSK343 treatment at 1.25, 2.5 and 5 μ 
M increased the ratios of KO to nondeleted control NSCs to 64%, 
71% and 80%, respectively (Fig. 5f), whereas the percentages of het-
erozygous to nondeleted control NSCs were unchanged by GSK343 
treatment (Supplementary Fig. 4c). These observations suggest that 
blocking the formation of H3K27me3 rescues the growth defects of 
KO NSCs. Increased ratios of KO versus nondeleted control NSCs 
were also seen after C646 treatment (Fig. 5f and Supplementary 
Fig. 4c), suggesting that blocking of H3K27ac also blocks the prolif-
eration defects of KO NSCs. By contrast, treatment of E14.5 NSCs 
with MM102 had no effect (Fig. 5f and Supplementary Fig. 4c). 
These results suggest that m6A regulates NSC proliferation, at least 
in part, through H3K27me3 and H3K27ac modifications.
H3K27me3 marks gene promoters and is associated with 
silencing34,35, whereas H3K27ac, which is enriched at promot-
ers and enhancers, is associated with gene activation36,37. Thus, 
we asked whether increased promoter H3K27me3 was associ-
ated with gene downregulation, whereas increased promoter/
enhancer H3K27ac was associated with gene upregulation in 
E14.5 Mettl14-KO versus control NSCs. To do so, we performed 
H3K27me3 and H3K27ac ChIP-seq analysis on E14.5 KO versus 
nondeleted NSCs (Supplementary Tables 5 and 6) and correlated 
changes in gene expression with altered histone modification. In 
total, the intensity of 1,610 promoter/enhancer H3K27ac peaks, 
defined as peaks within a 10-kb region up- or downstream of a 
transcriptional start site (TSS), were significantly altered in KO 
versus control cells. Pearson correlation analysis showed a positive 
correlation between changes in peak intensity and changes in gene 
expression (r = 0.06195, P = 
 0.01292) in KO versus control NSCs, 
suggesting that H3K27ac functions in m6A-regulated gene acti-
vation. We also detected 434 altered H3K27me3 promoter peaks, 
defined as peaks within 2 kb upstream of a TSS, in KO versus con-
trol NSCs. Although in this case we did not detect a significant 
correlation between changes in peak intensity and gene expression 
(P = 
 0.05784) using all 434 genes, we detected a strongly negative 
Pearson correlation (r = –0.38804, P < 
 0.02) when we analyzed only 
downregulated genes (log2 fold change ≤ 
 –0.6) in KO versus control 
NSCs, suggesting that H3K27me3 levels are positively correlated to 
the repression of genes showing decreased expression.
To further assess the relevance of altered H2K27ac and 
H3K27me3 modifications to NSC gene expression, we asked 
whether altered transcript abundance seen in KO versus control 
NSCs could be rescued by treating cells with inhibitors of H2K27ac 
(C646) or of H3K27me3 (GSK343). Using overlaying ChIP-seq 
and RNA-seq data and coupling that to Ingenuity pathway analysis 
 
(IPA), we picked five differentiation-related genes showing 
increased H3K27ac and increased expression and five cell-prolif-
eration related genes showing increased H3K27me3 but decreased 
expression for rescue experiment. Indeed, C646 treatment resulted 
in significantly decreased expression of the neuritogenesis regula-
tors Kif26a38, Gas739 and Pdgfrb40, in KO NSCs when compared 
with that in nondeleted NSCs (Fig. 6a–c), whereas GSK343 treat-
ment increased expression of the transcription factors Egr2 and 
Egr3, which are known to promote proliferation41 (Fig. 6d–f). These 
results suggest that m6A-regulated histone modification functions 
in NSC gene expression.
m6A regulates the stability of CBP and p300 transcripts. We 
then asked how m6A might regulate histone modifications. To do 
so, we first evaluated the presence of m6A on transcripts encod-
ing the H3K27 acetyltransferases CBP and p300 and the polycomb 
repressive complex (PRC2) subunits Ezh2, Suz12 and Eed, which 
catalyze H3K27me3, by methylated RNA immunoprecipitation 
(meRIP). We detected a 20–30% enrichment of m6A over input in 
CBP (Crebbp) and p300 (Ep300) mRNAs, which was lost in E14.5 
Mettl14-KO NSCs (Fig. 7a). In contrast, only a 0.4–0.6% enrich-
ment of m6A was observed in Ezh2, Eed and Suz12 mRNAs, and the 
extremely low levels that we observed for Ezh2 and Eed persisted in 
KO cells (Supplementary Fig. 5), suggesting that the signals that we 
detected are a result of the immunoprecipitation background.
We then evaluated potential changes in the stability of CBP 
and p300 mRNAs. We observed a significant increase in both CBP 
and p300 mRNA levels in E14.5 Mettl14-KO versus control NSCs 
(Fig. 7b). We then assayed mRNA stability by treating E14.5 cul-
tured KO and control NSCs with actinomycin D (ActD) to block 
transcription and harvesting cells 3 and 6 h later. Both CBP and 
p300 showed significantly increased mRNA stability in Mettl14-KO 
NSCs compared with nondeleted control NSCs (Fig. 7c), suggesting 
that m6A may regulate histone modification by destabilizing tran-
scripts that encode histone modifiers.
Discussion
By conditionally inactivating Mettl14 in embryonic NSCs, we dis-
covered that Mettl14 is required for NSC proliferation and main-
tains NSCs in an undifferentiated state (Figs. 1–3). Thus, our 
findings reveal a previously unknown, but essential, function of m6A 
RNA methylation in the regulation of NSC self-renewal. We also

observed decreased numbers of late-born neurons, which are gener-
ated from RGCs after E15.5, in the cortex of Mettl14-cKO animals at 
E17.5 and P0 (Fig. 4), consistent with the loss of Mettl14 expression 
and a decrease in size of the RGC pool. Notably, although Mettl14 
loss promoted premature NSC differentiation, the identity of neu-
ronal subtypes in each neuronal layer was not obviously affected in 
cortex of Mettl14-cKO brain. Thus, we conclude that RGCs lacking 
Mettl14 remain capable of differentiation and migration, and pro-
pose that cortical defects seen in Mettl14-KO mice are primarily a 
result of perturbed NSC self-renewal. Overall, our results provide 
a benchmark to further explore mechanisms underlying perturbed 
m6A RNA methylation in neurodevelopmental disorders. We 
also detected Mettl14 expression in postmitotic cortical neurons 
(Fig. 1e); thus, the possibility of a Mettl14 function in these cells 
cannot be excluded. However, given that the Mettl14-cKO mice in 
our study died shortly after birth, examination of potential Mettl14 
function in neurons at later postnatal or adult stages was not pos-
sible. We also note that, although we found a specific reduction 
in the number of upper layer projection neurons in the cortex of 
Mettl14-cKO versus control mice, we do not exclude the possibility 
that Mettl14 regulates production of neurons in other cortical lay-
ers. Analysis of that effect  is likely to require the use of a Cre driver 
to delete Mettl14 at an earlier time point than E13.5.
Our data suggest, for the first time, to our knowledge, the 
existence of cross-talk between RNA and histone modification. 
Although m6A reportedly regulates gene expression through diverse 
mechanisms such as mRNA stability4,13,19,20, splicing15,42–44 and trans-
lation45,46, an interaction between m6A modification and epigenetic 
mechanisms has not been explored. Thus, our finding that m6A 
RNA methylation regulates specific histone modifications, includ-
ing H3K27me3, H3K27ac and H3K4me3, represents a previously 
unknown mechanism of gene regulation. Among these modifica-
tions, H3K27ac and H3K4me3 are associated with gene activation, 
and H3K27me3e with repression, consistent with our observations 
that there is no marked bias toward gene activation or repression in 
Mettl14-KO NSCs compared with controls (Fig. 5a). Importantly, 
our data show that, in Mettl14-KO cells, different m6A-regulated 
histone marks regulate expression of genes of different function 
(Fig. 6), suggesting that m6A-regulated active and repressive his-
tone modifications work synergistically to ensure an NSC ground 
state. Synergy is also evident in our observation that treatment of 
cells with either H3K27me3 or H3K27ac inhibitors can, at least 
partially, restore cell proliferation in Mettl14-KO NSCs (Fig. 5). 
We did not observe any effects of the H3K4me3 inhibitor MM-102 
on NSC proliferation. However, unlike H3K27ac and H3K27me3, 
which are regulated by distinct enzymes, H3K4me3e modification 
is catalyzed by a panel of SET domain proteins47. Although MM-102 
is widely used to test H3K4me3 function, it inhibits the formation 
of a MLL1–WDR5 complex and therefore targets only the sub-
set of H3K4me3 modifications that are dependent on MLL148. As 
yet, there are no inhibitors available that inhibit activities of most 
H3K4me3 methyltransferases and therefore sufficiently abolish 
H3K4me3. Thus, we cannot exclude the possibility that m6A-reg-
ulated H3K4me3 regulates NSC proliferation. Future studies may 
reveal that m6A regulates levels of histone modifications other than 
H3K27ac, H3K27me3 and H3K4me3.
We further showed that m6A regulates histone modifications 
directly by destabilizing transcripts that encode histone modifi-
ers. It is evident that such a mechanism is applicable to the H3K27 
acetyltransferase CBP/p300, but not to subunits in the PRC2 com-
plex, suggesting that m6A regulates histone modifications through 
distinct mechanisms. Identification of those mechanisms warrants 
future investigation.
In summary, we propose a model (Fig. 7d) in which m6A loss 
alters histone modifications partly by regulating mRNA stability 
of histone modifiers, and altered histone modifications aberrantly 
repress proliferation-related genes and activate differentiation-
related genes, resulting in a loss of NSC ground state. Our results 
provide an in-depth analysis of m6A in brain neural stem cells and 
suggest that there is an interaction between m6A and histone modi-
fication as a mechanism of gene regulation.

Methods
Mettl14 gene targeting. Mettl14 gene targeting vector was created by E. coli 
bacterial recombination as described49. NotI-ApaI fragment including intron  
1 to 5 of Mettl14 in the fosmid WI1-205L1 (CHORI) was cloned into pGEM11-
DTA2L vector50, yielding pGEM-Mettl14(1-5)-DTA. Two primer pairs (M14-L50F 
and M14-L50R, the left arm for bacterial recombination; LoxP-LF and LoxP-LR) 
were annealed and cloned into XhoI/HindIII of pBS-2xFRT-Zeo, derivative of 
pBS-2xF5-Zeo51. The PCR fragment including Mettl14 intron 1 to 2 with loxP site 
(primer pair, M14-ex2F and M14-ex2R-LoxP) digested by BstBI-MluI and right 
arm adaptor (annealed primer pair, Mettl14-R50F and Mettl14-R50R) were cloned 
into the vector with the left arm. The splice acceptor (SA)-internal ribosomal entry 
site (Ires)-hygromycin resistance gene (Hyg)-tandem polyadenylation signals (tpA) 
cassette of pGEM-SA-Ires-Hyg-tpA was cloned into NheI-PmlI of the vector with 
left and right arms51. The bacterial targeting vector was digested by AgeI- NotI to 
remove vector backbone and was transfected into E. coli strain SW106 containing 
pGEM-Mettl14(1-5)-DTA for bacterial recombination, yielding Mettl14 targeting 
vector for mouse ES cells.
Mettl14 ES targeting vector was linearized by NotI and transfected into G4 
male ES cells as described52,53. 24 h after transfection, 150 μ 
g/ml Hygromycin was 
added to the ES medium. Hygromycin-resistant ES colonies were picked 10 d after 
transfection. Targeting of Mettl14 was confirmed by genomic PCR analysis using 
primer pairs: M14cF and SA-R for 5′ 
-end; UptpA-F and M14-cR for 3′ 
-end.
Generation of Mettl14 conventional and conditional knockout mice. Positive ES 
clones were used for injection into c57 blastocysts and generation of chimerical mice. 
To produce Mettl14f/+ mice, the chimeras were crossed with wild-type c57 for germ 
line transmission and then crossed with Atcb-Flpe transgenic mice (The Jackson 
Laboratory, # 003800) to remove FRT flanked selection cassette. Male Mettl14f/+ 
mice were crossed to female EIIa-Cre transgenic mice (The Jackson Laboratory, # 
003724) to obtain Mettl14+/− mice, and Mettl14+/− mice were intercrossed to obtain 
Mettl14–conventional knockout mice. Sex of embryos was determined.
To conditionally knock out Mettl14 in brain, floxed Mettl14 mice were bred 
with Nestin-Cre transgenic mice (The Jackson Laboratory, # 003771) to generate 
Mettl14f/f;Nestin-cre. Sex of embryos was not determined. Mice were maintained 
at the Sanford Burnham Prebys Medical Discovery Institute Institutional animal 
facility, and experiments were performed in accordance with experimental 
protocols approved by local Institutional Animal Care and Use Committees.
Genotyping. Genotyping was performed using the MyTaq Extract-PCR kit 
(Bioline) with primer sets corresponding to the primer list table  
(Supplementary Table 7).
Injection of S-phase tracer. IdU/BrdU double-labeling was performed as 
previously described18. Briefly, pregnant females were injected intraperitoneally 
with Iododeoxyuridine (IdU, Sigma) (100 mg/kg body weight) and 1.5 h later with 
the same dose of BrdU (Sigma) and killed after 0.5 h.
For BrdU single-labeling, pregnant females were injected intraperitoneally with 
BrdU (100 mg/kg body weight) and killed after 0.5 or 24 h.
Immunohistochemistry. Frozen sections were boiled in citrate buffer, pH 
6.0 (Sigma), penetrated in 0.25% Triton X-100 in PBS for 30 min at room 
temperature and blocked in PBST (PBS with 0.2% Tween-20) containing 10% 
normal goat serum (Abcam). Sections were incubated with primary antibody 
at 4 °C overnight. Secondary antibodies were applied to sections for 2 h at room 
temperature. The primary antibodies used were as follows: rabbit anti-Mettl14

Polyclonal/T-6392). DAPI (Thermo Fisher Scientific, Cat. # 62248; 1:1,000) was 
used as nuclear counterstaining and slides were mounted in FluroSave reagent 
(Millipore, Cat. # 345789).
For BrdU staining, sections were treated with 2 N HCl at 37 °C for 30 min and 
0.1 M borate buffer, pH 8.5, for 10 min at room temperature.
Pax6-Tbr2 and Pax6-Mettl14 co-staining were performed according to the 
protocol described in a previous paper54. In brief, sections were incubated with 
highly diluted (1:30,000) primary antibody overnight at 4 °C and biotinylated 
goat anti-rabbit secondary antibody for 1 h at room temperature. The signal was 
amplified with the horseradish-peroxidase-based Vectastain ABC Kit (Vector 
Laboratories, Cat. # PK-6101) and Cyanine 3 Tyramide System (Perkin Elmer,  
Cat. # NEL704A001KT).
Fluorescence images were acquired by Zeiss LSM 710 confocal microscope and 
analyzed in ImageJ software.
NPC isolation and culture. Cortex region was dissected out from embryonic 
brains and triturated by pipetting. Dissociated cells were cultured as neurospheres 
with NeuroCult Proleferation Medium (Stemcell Tech.) according to the 
manufacturer’s protocols. Lentiviral constructs harboring shRNAs against 
Alkbh5 or Fto were purchased from Sigma-Aldrich (see below for details). Stable 
knockdown lines were generated using standard viral infection and puromycin 
selection (2 μ 
g/ml).

Purification of mRNA. Total RNA was isolated using TRIZOL (Invitrogen) 
and treated with DNase I (Roche). Polyadenylated mRNA was purified using 
the GenElute mRNA Miniprep Kit (Sigma-Aldrich), and residual ribosomal RNA 
was depleted with RiboMinus Eukaryote System v2 (Life Technologies).
2D-TLC. 2D-TLC was performed similarly as described55. Briefly, 500 ng purified 
polyA+ 
/ribo– RNA was digested with 20 U RNase T1 (Thermo Fisher Scientific) 
in 20 µ 
l 1× PNK buffer for 2 h at 37 °C. The digested RNA was labeled using 
10 U T4 PNK (Thermo Fisher Scientific) and 1 µ 
l γ 
-32P-ATP (6,000 Ci/mmol, 
150 mCi/ml, Perkin-Elmer) and for 1 h at 37 °C and precipitated. The RNA pellet 
was resuspended in 5 µ 
l buffer containing 25 mM NaCl, 2.5 mM ZnSO4 and 1 U 
nuclease P1 (Sigma) and incubated at 37 °C overnight. 1 µ 
l product was loaded 
onto a PEI-Cellulose TLC plate (Millipore) and developed in isobutyric acid: 0.5 M 
NH4OH (5:3, v/v) as first dimension and isopropanol:HCl:water (70:15:15, v/v/v) 
as second dimension. After development, the plate was exposed to a phosphor 
screen and scanned using a FujiFilm FLA-5100 imager.
m6A dot-blot. Purified polyA+ 
 RNA was blotted to a nylon membrane (Millipore) 
using Bio-Dot Microfiltration Apparatus (Bio-Rad). After cross-linking with a 
UV cross-linker (Spectroline), the membrane was blocked with nonfat milk in 
TBST and then incubated with antibody to m6A (Synaptic Systems, Cat. # 202 
003, 1:1,000; dot blot validation and peer-reviewed citations at https://www.sysy.

anti%20mouse%20igg/product/LI-COR/?r=4.95&cf=0&uq=IRDye%20680RD%20
Goat%20anti-Mouse%20IgG). Membranes were scanned by Odyssey Imager (LI-
COR Biosciences) and quantified using Image Studio Lite (LI-COR Biosciences).
RT-qPCR. DNase-I-treated total RNA was used to synthesize cDNA using an 
iScript cDNA synthesis kit (Bio-Rad) according to the manufacturer’s protocols. 
qPCR was performed with primer sets corresponding to the primer list table 
(Supplementary Table 7) and using iTaq Universal SYBR Green Supermix  
(Bio-Rad) on a BioRad CFX96 Touch Real-Time PCR Detection.
RNA-seq analysis. RNA-seq alignment. Tuxedo-suite was used for the entire RNA-
seq analyses56. Specifically, TopHat2 (v2.1.0) was used to align RNA-seq reads to 
the mouse genome (mm10). To ensure correct alignment especially for assigning 
the spliced reads to the correct transcripts, we supplied the software with an 
existing transcript reference annotation from RefSeq with option–GTF. The RefSeq 
annotation is available as the iGenome project at the TopHat website (https://ccb.
jhu.edu/software/tophat/igenomes.shtml). Other settings of the aligner were left to 
the default.
Transcript assembly. We then supplied the alignment BAM files from TopHat2 to 
Cufflinks to perform transcript assembly and expression estimation. The assembly 
was guided by the above RefSeq annotations with option–GTF-guide. We also turn 
on the multi-read correction (--multi-read-correct) and fragment bias correction 
options (--frag-bias-correct $genome) to correct for the sequencing biases. Other 
settings of the assembler were left to the default.
Differential analysis. We assembled transcripts in each sample library and 
biological replicate separately. In the end, we ran Cuffmerge to combine all 
assembled transcripts into a merged custom annotation file (merged.gtf) for 
the differential expression analysis. In particular, we ran Cuffdiff to compare 
between M14 knockout mutant and wild-type libraries using the read alignment 
files from TopHat2 as input and the above custom annotation file as reference. 
The 3 biological replicates per condition were used to estimate the dispersion 
in the negative binomial likelihood function modeled by Cuffdiff. We also 
enabled --multi-read-correct and --frag-bias-correct to improve estimation. The 
main output from Cuffdiff that were used for downstream analysis in this paper 
were the “gene_exp.diff” and “genes.read_group_tracking” (default output names 
from the software), which provide the differential expression statistical results 
and the actual expression estimate in terms of FPKM, respectively. Significant 
fold-change was determined based on FDR < 0.05 (as the default threshold of the 
Cuffdiff program).
GO analysis. GO analyses were performed by DAVID. Differentially expressed 
genes had an adjusted P < 
 0.01 and a twofold or greater expression difference.
ChIP-seq analysis. Chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP). For ChIP experiments, 
NPCs cultured for 7 d in vitro were harvested and cross-linked for 5 min at room 
temperature using 1% formaldehyde. Cells were lysed by rotation for 10 min at 
4 °C in cell lysis buffer (20 mM Tris, pH 8, 85 mM KCl, 0.5% NP-40, protease 
inhibitor cocktail). Nuclei were pelleted and re-suspended in nuclei lysis buffer 
(50 mM Tris, pH 8, 10 mM EDTA, 0.25% SDS, protease inhibitor cocktail). 
Chromatin was sheared by Covaris S2 using AFA microtube and a low cell 
chromatin shearing protocol for 12 min. Lysates were cleared by centrifugation at 
20,000g at 4 °C for 5 min and used as IP inputs. IP was done using the MAGnify 
Chromatin Immunoprecipitation System (Thermo Fisher Scientific) according 
to the manufacturer’s protocols. The antibodies used were as follows: rabbit 
anti-H3K27ac (Abcam, Cat. # Ab4729, Lot. # GR312658-1; ChIP validation and 
peer-reviewed citations at http://www.abcam.com/histone-h3-acetyl-k27-antibody-
chip-grade-ab4729.html), rabbit anti-H3K27me3 (Millipore, Cat. # 07-449, Lot. 
# 2686928; ChIP validation at http://www.emdmillipore.com/US/en/product/
Anti-trimethyl-Histone-H3-Lys27-Antibody,MM_NF-07-449 and peer-reviewed

4.88&cf= 
0&uq= 
Millipore, Cat. - 07%252D449). Chromatin samples were sent for 
high-throughput sequencing.
ChIP-seq alignment, peak calling, and comparison. To align ChIP-seq DNA reads to 
the reference mm10 genome, we used Bowtie2 (v2.3.1)57 with the default options

except that “--broad” was turned on for calling broad peaks. Each ChIP library in 
each biological replicate was compared against the DNA input background library 
in the corresponding cell type + 
 condition. Specifically, histone marks H3K4me3 
and H3K27ac in wild-type and M14 KO mutant of mouse neural progenitor 
cell (NPC) were compared with the DNA input in wild-type and M14 KO NPC, 
respectively. Default cutoffs of FDR < 
 0.05 were used to determine ChIP-seq 
peaks relative to the input libraries. The main outputs from MACS2 were the 
broadPeak files in BED format, which we used for downstream comparison among 
the experimental conditions and with other cognate genome-wide results (that is, 
RNA-seq and RIP-seq).
meRIP-seq analysis. meRIP. meRIP was performed as previously described4. 
Briefly, total RNA was extracted using Trizol reagent (Invitrogen). RNA was 
treated with RNase-free DNase I (Roche) to deplete DNA contamination. PolyA 
RNA was purified using a GenElute mRNA Miniprep Kit (Sigma-Aldrich) as per 
the manufacturer’s instructions and fragmented using an RNA fragmentation kit 
(Ambion). 200 µ 
g of fragmented RNA was incubated with 3 μ 
g anti-m6A (Synaptic 
Systems, catalog number 202 003; RIP validation and peer-reviewed citations at 
https://www.sysy.com/products/m6a/facts-202003.php) in RIP buffer (150 mM 
NaCl, 10 mM Tris and 0.1% NP-40) for 2 h at 4 °C, followed by the addition of 
washed protein A/G magnetic beads (Millipore) and incubation at 4 °C for a 
further 2 h. Beads were washed 6 times in RIP buffer and incubated with 50 μ 
l 
immunoprecipitation buffer containing 0.5 mg ml−1 m6AMP (Sigma-Aldrich) to 
elute RNA. Immunoprecipitated RNA was extracted with phenol/chloroform, and 
RNA samples were sent for high-throughput sequencing.
meRIP-seq alignment and peak calling. We used Tophat2 to align reads to the mouse 
reference mm10 genome with default setting and RefSeq annotations as a guide 
(that is, the same method as in the RNA-seq analysis). To call RIP-seq peaks, we 
used MACS2 with default settings except for enabling the --broad option (that is, 
the same as in the ChIP-seq analysis).
RNA stability assay. Actinomycin D (Sigma-Aldrich) at 5 μ 
g/ml was added to 
NPC culture. After 0, 3 or 6 h of incubation, cells were collected and RNAs were 
isolated for qPCR.
Statistical analysis. All data are expressed as mean ± 
 s.d., as indicated in the 
figure legends. Statistical analyses were completed with Prism GraphPad 7. Data 
comparing WT versus Mettl14 Het and KO phenotypes and data of inhibitor 
treatment were analyzed using one-way ANOVA followed by Bonferroni’s multiple 
comparisons test. Data comparing WT versus Mettl14-KO were analyzed using 
unpaired t-test. NSC growth curves were analyzed using two-way ANOVA 
followed by Bonferroni’s multiple comparisons test. RNA stability data comparing 
WT versus Mettl14-KO NSCs were analyzed using two-way ANOVA.  
The association between m6A targets and differential gene expression in Mettl14-KO 
 
versus nondeleted control NSCs were determined by Fisher’s exact test. Correlation 
analyses between changes in ChIP peak intensity and changes in gene expression 
were done using Pearson correlation analysis. No statistical methods were used to 
pre-determine sample sizes but our sample sizes are similar to those reported in 
previous publications1,2,4,13,16,18. Data distribution was assumed to be normal but this 
was not formally tested. There was no randomization in the organization of the 
experimental conditions. Data collection and analysis were not performed blind to 
the conditions of the experiments. We did not exclude any animals for data point 
from the analysis.
Accession codes. The data discussed in this publication have been deposited

5.   Describe the experimental replicates.
ChIP-seq were performed on 2 E14.5 Mettl14 KO NSC lines and 2 E14.5 
nondeleted NSC lines.
6.   Describe the sequencing depth for each 
experiment.
On average 20 million 76-bp single-end reads per library were mapped and 
70% of the reads were uniquely mapped to the reference genome.
7.   Describe the antibodies used for the ChIP-seq 
experiments.
The antibodies used were as follows: rabbit anti-H3K27ac (Active Motif, 
Cat. # Ab4729, Lot. # GR312658-1) and rabbit anti-H3K27me3 (Millipore, 
Cat. # 07-449, Lot. # 2686928). Both antibodies are ChIP grade and used in 
ENCODE project (https://genome.ucsc.edu/ENCODE/antibodies.html). 
8.   Describe the peak calling parameters.
To align ChIP-seq DNA reads to the reference mm10 genome, we used 
Bowtie2 (v2.3.1) (Langmead and Salzberg 2012) with the default options 
except that “--broad” was turned on for calling broad peaks. Each ChIP 
library in each biological replicate was compared against the DNA input 
background library in the corresponding cell type + condition. Specifically, 
histone marks H3K4me1, H3K4me3, H3K27ac, and H3K27me3 in wild-type 
and M14 knockout (KO) mutant of mouse neural progenitor cell (NPC) 
were compared with the DNA input in wild-type and M14 KO NPC, 
respectively. Default cutoff of FDR < 0.05 were used to determine ChIP-seq 
peaks relative to the input libraries.
9.   Describe the methods used to ensure data quality.
Default MACS peak call threshold was used to obtain peaks at FDR < 0.05. 
On average, 52,299 peaks were retained per library and 6368 peaks with 
fold-enrichments greater than 5 over the 20 ChIP-seq libraries.
10. Describe the software used to collect and analyze 
R environment and custom scripts were used to collect peaks and analyze

Flow Cytometry Reporting Summary
 Form fields will expand as needed. Please do not leave fields blank.
�    Data presentation
For all flow cytometry data, confirm that:
1.  The axis labels state the marker and fluorochrome used (e.g. CD4-FITC).
2.  The axis scales are clearly visible. Include numbers along axes only for bottom left plot of group (a 'group' is an analysis of 
identical markers).
3.  All plots are contour plots with outliers or pseudocolor plots.
4.  A numerical value for number of cells or percentage (with statistics) is provided.

5.   Describe the sample preparation.
Mouse brain cortex were dissected out from E14.5 or E17.5 embryonic 
brains and triturated by pipeting. Dissociated cells were cultured as 
neurospheres with NeuroCult Proliferation Medium (Stemcell Tech.) 
before flow cytometry. Dissociated NSCs were incubated with Dead Cell 
Apoptosis Kit with Annexin V Alexa Fluor-488 & Propidium Iodide (Thermo 
Fisher Scientific) following manufacturer’s protocols. Briefly cells were 
diluted in 1× annexin-binding buffer to ~ 1×10^6 cells/mL, add 5ul Alexa 
Fluor® 488 annexin V and 1 μL 100 μg/mL PI working solution  to each 100 
μL of cell suspension and incubate at room temperature for 15 minutes. 
After incubation add 400 μL 1× annexin-binding buffer and analyze the 
stained cells by flow cytometry.

8.   Describe the abundance of the relevant cell 
populations within post-sort fractions.
No sorting was involved in this study.
9.   Describe the gating strategy used.
Cell debris were excluded by FSC-A/SSC-A plot and singlets were gated by 
SSC-A/SSC-W plot. The gates for Propidium Iodide (PI) and AnnexinV-FITC 
were determined by non staining cells, PI single staining cells and 
AnnexinV-FITC single staining cells.
