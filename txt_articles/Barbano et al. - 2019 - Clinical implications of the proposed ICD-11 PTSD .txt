Abstract
Background. Projected changes to post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) diagnostic criteria in
the upcoming International Classification of Diseases (ICD)-11 may affect the prevalence and
severity of identified cases. This study examined differences in rates, severity, and overlap of
diagnoses using ICD-10 and ICD-11 PTSD diagnostic criteria during consecutive assessments
of recent survivors of traumatic events.
Methods. The study sample comprised 3863 survivors of traumatic events, evaluated in 11
longitudinal studies of PTSD. ICD-10 and ICD-11 diagnostic rules were applied to the
Clinician-Administered PTSD Scale (CAPS) to derive ICD-10 and ICD-11 diagnoses at dif-
ferent time intervals between trauma occurrence and 15 months.
Results. The ICD-11 criteria identified fewer cases than the ICD-10 across assessment inter-
vals (range −47.09% to −57.14%). Over 97% of ICD-11 PTSD cases met concurrent ICD-10
PTSD criteria. PTSD symptom severity of individuals identified by the ICD-11 criteria (CAPS
total scores) was 31.38–36.49% higher than those identified by ICD-10 criteria alone. The lat-
ter, however, had CAPS scores indicative of moderate PTSD. ICD-11 was associated with
similar or higher rates of comorbid mood and anxiety disorders. Individuals identified by
either ICD-10 or ICD-11 shortly after traumatic events had similar longitudinal course.
Conclusions. This study indicates that significantly fewer individuals would be diagnosed
with PTSD using the proposed ICD-11 criteria. Though ICD-11 criteria identify more severe
cases, those meeting ICD-10 but not ICD-11 criteria remain in the moderate range of PTSD
symptoms. Use of ICD-11 criteria will have critical implications for case identification in
clinical practice, national reporting, and research.
Introduction
The Post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) diagnostic criteria have been recently revised in the
Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders (DSM; American Psychiatric
Association, 2013), and their revision in the International Classification of Diseases (ICD;
World Health Organization) is pending. The implementation of the new DSM-5 diagnostic
criteria significantly affected the prevalence estimates, clinical characteristics, and overlap
between samples identified as having PTSD (Hoge et al. 2016). The update from the 10th edi-
tion of the ICD (ICD-10; World Health Organization, 1993) to the upcoming 11th edition
(ICD-11; World Health Organization, 2018) offers a particularly radical alteration. While
the ICD-10 takes a fairly broad diagnostic approach and includes 13 symptoms in its diagnos-
tic template, the ICD-11 proposes to remove the symptoms common to PTSD and other dis-
orders (e.g. sleep disturbances, irritability) toward increasing the specificity of the diagnosis
(Maercker et al. 2013). The proposed ICD-11 template comprises, therefore, six disorder-
defining criteria: dissociative flashbacks, nightmares, hypervigilance, exaggerated startle
response, avoidance of external reminders, and avoidance of thoughts and feelings associated

 with the traumatic event. The differences between the ICD-10 and
ICD-11 diagnostic templates may significantly affect the preva-
lence and the clinical characteristics of patients identified, and
its study is both important and timely.
Studies to date have evaluated the rates of PTSD diagnoses
using ICD-10 and ICD-11 criteria among survivors of childhood
institutional abuse (Knefel and Lueger-Schuster, 2013; Gluck et al.
2016), adult and adolescent survivors of a mass shooting
(Haravuori et al. 2016), individuals living in conflict-torn villages
in Timor-Leste (Tay et al. 2017), community-dwelling adults and
war veterans (Wisco et al. 2016), and a multi-national World
Mental Health survey (Stein et al. 2014). These studies have
repeatedly shown that the ICD-11 identifies fewer PTSD cases.
Most studies have also reported an overlap between ICD-10 and
ICD-11 diagnoses, in which the latter identified a subset of
individuals
identified
by
the
former
(Gluck
et
al.
2016;
Haravuori et al. 2016; Tay et al. 2017).
Studies to date have addressed chronic PTSD patients using
one-time, cross-section assessment. However, a recent work has
shown that PTSD symptoms fluctuate, and trauma survivors’
diagnostic statuses change following trauma exposure (Bryant
et al. 2013). To longitudinally examine the implications of the
proposed ICD revision, the current study examined ICD-10 and
ICD-11 diagnoses made at different time intervals after trauma
exposure. Data from 11 longitudinal studies of early PTSD in
Australia,
Israel,
Japan,
Switzerland,
the
USA,
and
the
Netherlands were pooled, and ICD-10 and ICD-11 diagnoses were
obtained at two time intervals after the traumatic event: 0–60
days, representing an early post-exposure period, and 122–456
days (4–15 months), representing a period of persisting PTSD symp-
toms. The latter was secondarily divided into a 122–270 days (4–9
months) period, during which further recovery is expected, and a
271–456 days (9–15 months) period, representing more chronic,
stable PTSD. To strictly meet the ICD minimum symptom duration
criterion for a PTSD diagnosis, a 22–60 days time interval was add-
itionally used as an initial assessment time interval.
For each time interval, we compared the prevalence of PTSD
per ICD-10 and ICD-11 criteria, the overlap between samples
so defined, the severity of cases identified by each template, differ-
ences in age and gender distributions, the presence of comorbid
mood and anxiety disorders, and the stability of both diagnostic
groups over time.
Method
Sources of data
Data for this work were obtained from the pooled dataset of the
International Consortium to Predict PTSD (ICPP; Qi et al. submit-
ted for publication). ICPP studies had longitudinally evaluated adult
civilians admitted to general hospitals’ emergency departments
(EDs) following traumatic events that included motor vehicle acci-
dents (71.35%), other non-interpersonal accidents (22.68%), and
interpersonal violence (5.97%). Raw, item-level data shared by
ICPP investigators were cleaned, harmonized, and processed to pro-
vide standardized measures of PTSD and demographic data. Eleven
studies used the DSM-IV (American Psychiatric Association, 2000)
version of the Clinician-Administered PTSD Scale (CAPS; Blake
et al. 1995) and were included in the present analysis (Shalev
et al. 2000; Bonne et al. 2001; Hepp et al. 2008; Irish et al. 2008;

 Frijling et al. 2014) (Table 1). In total, 37.40% of the participants
were females and 62.60% were males. The sample’s mean age was
40.0 (S.D. = 13.93).
Instruments
The CAPS for DSM-IV, a structured clinical interview, was used
to measure PTSD symptom severity and infer ICD-10 and
ICD-11 diagnostic status. CAPS items include all 17 DSM-IV
PTSD diagnostic criteria. It quantifies each symptom’s frequency
and intensity on a scale of 0–4. The CAPS total score (sum of
symptoms’ intensities and frequencies, range 0–136) quantifies
PTSD symptom severity. Following CAPS guidelines, we defined
a symptom as positively endorsed if its frequency score was 1
or more and its intensity score 2 or more (Weathers et al. 1999;
Weathers et al. 2001). The ED admission ‘index events’ were
used in all subsequent PTSD evaluations.
Following previous recommendations, participants’ PTSD
severity was rated as either asymptomatic (CAPS total scores between
0 and 19), mild/subthreshold (CAPS total scores between 20 and 39),
moderate (CAPS total scores between 40 and 59), severe (CAPS total
scores between 60 and 79), or extreme (CAPS total scores ⩾80)
(Weathers et al. 1999; Blake et al. 2000; Weathers et al. 2001).
ICD diagnoses and severity
As previously delineated (Brewin, 2013) and used (Knefel and
Lueger-Schuster, 2013), ICD-10 and ICD-11 diagnoses were
derived from DSM-IV symptoms aligned with the ICD-10 and
ICD-11 diagnostic criteria. For ICD-10, the criteria were: one out
of CAPS items 1 through 5 (B cluster); one out of items 6 and 7
(C1 and C2); and either item 8 (C3) or two out of items 13 through
17 (D cluster). For ICD-11, the criteria were: one out of CAPS
items 2 and 3 (B2 and B3); one out of items 6 and 7 (C1 and
C2); and one out of items 16 and 17 (D4 and D5) (Table 2). As
an auxiliary analysis, we included the B1 criterion (vivid intrusive
memories of the traumatic event) in the ICD-11 diagnostic formula
to test an extended set of CAPS-derived ICD-11 diagnostic identi-
fiers, in which endorsement of B1, B2, or B3 fulfilled the B criteria.
For analysis, the following groups were identified: an ‘ICD-10’
group (study participants who met ICD-10 diagnostic criteria), an
‘ICD-11’ group (participants who met ICD-11 diagnostic criteria),
and a ‘no PTSD’ group (participants meeting neither ICD-10 nor
ICD-11 diagnostic criteria). Additionally, participants who met
ICD-10 but not ICD-11 criteria constituted an ‘ICD-10-only’
group. Precluding valid group comparisons, very few participants
met ICD-11 diagnostic criteria alone (n < 10, and <3% at both
time intervals). Patterns leading to the few ICD-11 cases not
meeting ICD-10 criteria were explored.
Clinically significant impairment (CAPS criterion F) was
assessed in 75.1% (n = 2903) of the sample and used to evaluate
the effect of including this new requirement in ICD-11’s diagno-
sis. Additionally, PTSD symptoms’ onset before 6 months (a sug-
gested feature of ICD-10) was evaluated to ascertain the inclusion
in the ICD-10 group after 6 months.
Time intervals
Time intervals between the traumatic events and subsequent
assessments were measured, for each CAPS assessment, as ‘days
from trauma’. For analyses, CAPS time bracket data were grouped
into two time intervals: an early post-exposure period extending
from 0 to 60 days (first 2 months) following trauma exposure
and a 122–456 days (4–15 months) time interval, during which
PTSD minimum duration criteria are met. Out of 3863 participants
included in this work, 3453 were present in the 0–60 days time
interval, and 2880 were present in the 122–456 days time interval.
Two secondary analyses were performed: First, the 122–456
days time interval was further divided into 122–270 days (4–9
months) after trauma exposure to inform an early PTSD period,
and 271–456 days (9–15 months) to inform a late, mostly stable,
expression of PTSD. Second, to strictly meet the ICD minimum
illness duration criterion for a PTSD diagnosis, a 22–60 time
interval was additionally used for including subjects in the initial
assessment.
Every participant with a CAPS assessment within a time inter-
val was included in the analysis. The earliest CAPS evaluation was
used in the participants with more than one CAPS assessment
during the 0–60 and 22–60 days time intervals and the latest
CAPS assessment was used during subsequent time intervals.
Participants lost to follow-up [i.e. present in the 0–60 days
time interval and absent from the 122–456 days time interval
(n = 980)] did differ from those retained in their initial PTSD
symptom severity (M = 30.54, S.D. = 26.34 for participants lost to

The median times since trauma were 17 days [interquartile
range (IQR) = 29] for the 0–60 days interval, 37 days (IQR = 17)
for the 22–60 days interval, 321 days (IQR = 188) for the 122–
456 days interval, 187 days (IQR = 50) for the 122–270 days inter-
val, and 374 days (IQR = 33) for the 271–456 days interval.
Concurrent psychiatric diagnoses
Concurrent DSM-IV psychiatric disorders were evaluated in
2550 (66.0%) participants using either the Mini-International
Neuropsychiatric Interview (MINI; Sheehan et al. 1998) in three
studies (Matsuoka et al. 2009; Bryant et al. 2013; Mouthaan
et al. 2013) or the Structured Clinical Interview for DSM-IV
Axis I Disorders (SCID; First et al. 2002) in four studies
(Shalev et al. 2000; Bonne et al. 2001; Shalev et al. 2008; Shalev
et al. 2012). Concurrent anxiety disorders and mood disorders
(excluding bipolar disorder) were grouped to create an ‘any anx-
iety disorder’ variable and an ‘any depressive disorder’ variable to
enable large enough numbers in each category.
Longitudinal course
To longitudinally assess the course of early ICD-10 and ICD-11
diagnostic groups, we compared the PTSD status (recovery and
migration between diagnostic groups) and symptom severity
(total CAPS score) of participants originally allocated to these
diagnostic categories at the 122–456 days time interval.
Studies’ heterogeneity
In order to assess the individual studies’ contribution to the
pooled data outcome, we examined heterogeneity of studies
using individual participant-level data at the 0–60 and 122–456
days time intervals and combined study-by-study results.
Data analysis
All analyses were conducted using R software (R Core Team,
2017). Means, standard deviations, and confidence intervals of
CAPS scores and age were calculated for ICD classification at
each time point. Proportions were calculated for gender at each
time point. A χ2 test for proportions with a Yates continuity cor-
rection was used to test the differences in the proportions of
ICD-10-only and ICD-11 diagnoses in the total sample.
Confidence intervals for gender proportions were calculated
via the Score method. Welch’s t test was used to examine the dif-
ferences in mean age and CAPS total severity score between
ICD-10-only and ICD-11 classifications. The all ICD-10 v. all
ICD-11 groups were not tested, given the high degree of non-
independence between the groups. Cohen’s κ was calculated to
determine the level of agreement between the diagnostic indices.
Fisher’s exact test was carried out to assess the statistical sig-
nificance of the relative odds of having a comorbid diagnosis of
a depressive or anxiety disorder with ICD-10-only or ICD-11
PTSD for each of the SCID and the MINI.
In evaluating studies’ heterogeneity, an I2 statistic, a measure
of heterogeneity in the study results, was used to determine
whether a fixed- or random-effects model would be used in pool-
ing study-by-study results. Mean differences and confidence
intervals were pooled according to the inverse-variance method.
Studies that did not have both ICD-10-only and ICD-11 cases
were not included in this analysis.
Results
Cross-sectional prevalence
During the 0–60 days time interval, the prevalence of ICD-10
PTSD was 24.89%, and that of ICD-11 PTSD was 12.94%
(Fig. 1). Most of the ICD-11 group (97.99%) also met ICD-10 diag-
nostic criteria. Mean CAPS scores of the participants with ICD-11
PTSD were higher than those with ICD-10 PTSD ( p < 0.0001)
(Table 3). Cohen’s κ revealed moderate agreement between the
ICD-10 and ICD-11 (κ = 0.60, 95% CI 0.57–0.63) (Altman, 1990).
During the 122–456 days time interval, the prevalence of
ICD-10 PTSD was 14.10%, and the prevalence of ICD-11 PTSD
was 6.88% (Fig. 1). Most of the ICD-11 group (97.47%) also
met ICD-10 diagnostic criteria. Mean CAPS scores of participants
with ICD-11 PTSD were again higher than mean CAPS scores of
those with ICD-10 PTSD ( p < 0.0001) (Table 3). Cohen’s κ
revealed moderate agreement between the ICD-10 and ICD-11
(κ = 0.60, 95% CI 0.56–0.65) (Altman, 1990).
Age and gender did not differ across these time intervals
between ICD-10 and ICD-11 classification. However, in compar-
ing those who only met ICD-10 criteria with those who met
ICD-11 criteria, the ICD-10-only group was associated with
older age at both time intervals (for 0–60 days, p = 0.013; for
122–456 days, p = 0.013).
Results secondarily obtained during the 122–270 days and 270–
456 days time intervals were similar in ICD-identified PTSD preva-
lence and difference in mean CAPS scores (Fig. 1; Table 3).
Using the 22–60 days time interval, the prevalence of ICD-10
PTSD was 25.27% and that of ICD-11 PTSD was 14.33%. Most of
the ICD-11 group (98.7%) also met ICD-10 diagnostic criteria.
Mean CAPS scores of ICD-11 cases were significantly higher
than mean CAPS scores of ICD-10 cases ( p < 0.0001) (Table 3).
Including the B1 criterion in ICD-11 definition yielded
somewhat
higher
overlap
between
the
diagnostic
groups
(65.23% and 62.81% of ICD-10 cases also met ICD-11 criteria,
respectively, for the early and late time intervals), similarly low
prevalence of ICD-11-only cases (<3%), and higher CAPS total
severity scores in the ICD-11 group at the two time intervals
(M = 68.91, S.D. = 20.15 v. M = 50.77, S.D. = 16.49, p < 0.0001 for
the early assessment; and M = 65.69, S.D. = 21.01 v. M = 46.98,
S.D. = 16.03, p < 0.001 for the later assessment). Similar differences
in symptom severity were found at the 122–270 days time interval
( p < 0.0001) and the 271–456 days time interval ( p < 0.0001).
Importantly, the ICD-10-only group continued to express
moderate-to-high levels of PTSD symptoms.
There were nine participants in the ICD-11-only group in the
0–60 days time interval and five in the 122–456 days time interval.
Of these participants, none endorsed the following four ICD-10
symptom criteria: C3 (inability to recall an important aspect of
the trauma), D1 (difficulty falling or staying asleep), D2 (irritabil-
ity or outbursts of anger), and D3 (difficulty concentrating).
Among participants who met ICD-11 PTSD diagnostic criteria,
95.6% and 97.3% met the CAPS F criterion at the 0–60 and 122–
456 days time intervals, respectively. The number of participants
who did not meet the F criterion was consistently ⩽7. Based on
the data, the inclusion of an F criterion would not likely signifi-
cantly impact the overlap in ICD-10 and ICD-11 classifications.
There were no cases of ICD-10 PTSD onset after 6 months.

 Classification migration and trajectories
With time, the majority of both the ICD-10-only group (67.41%)
and ICD-11 group (57.50%) went into remission in their respect-
ive diagnostic definition. Migration between PTSD classifications
comprised 10.86% of participants with early ICD-10 classification
meeting ICD-11 criteria at the later assessment and 19.64% par-
ticipants with early ICD-11 classification meeting ICD-10 alone
criteria at the later assessment. A small number of participants
without early PTSD developed an ICD-10-only (3.72%) or an
ICD-11 diagnosis (3.19%) at follow-up. Finally, 21.73% of the
ICD-10-only group and 22.86% of the ICD-11 group maintained
their diagnostic status over time.
Concurrent psychiatric diagnoses
In total, 51.3% of ICD-11 cases and 39.8% of ICD-10-only cases
met SCID diagnostic criteria for a depressive disorder during the
0–60 days time interval. ICD-11 cases had significantly higher
odds of a SCID comorbid depressive disorder than ICD-10-only
cases during the 0–60 days time interval (OR 1.59, 95% CI
1.14–2.22, p = 0.007), but similar odds during the 122–456 days
time interval (OR 1.50, 95% CI 0.83–2.73, p = 0.16), in which
47.9% of ICD-11 cases and 38.0% of ICD-10-only cases met
SCID diagnostic criteria for a depressive disorder. In total,
20.3% of ICD-11 cases and 20.8% of ICD-10-only cases met
SCID diagnostic criteria for an anxiety disorder in the 0–60
days time interval, and the relative odds were not statistically sig-
nificant (OR 0.97, 95% CI 0.64–1.46, p = 0.917). In total, 20.8% of
ICD-11 cases and 18.5% of ICD-10-only cases met SCID diagnos-
tic criteria for an anxiety disorder in the 122–456 days time
interval, and the relative odds were again not statistically signifi-
cant (OR 1.16, 95% CI 0.55–2.46, p = 0.73). For the MINI,
49.2% of ICD-11 cases and 48.5% of ICD-10-only cases met
MINI diagnostic criteria for a depressive disorder in the 0–60
days time interval and the relative odds were insignificant (OR
1.03, 95% CI 0.40–1.66, p = 1.00). In total, 45.4% of ICD-11
cases and 49.3% of ICD-10-only cases met MINI diagnostic cri-
teria for an anxiety disorder in the 0–60 days time interval and
the relative odds were again insignificant (OR 1.17, 95% CI
0.55–1.79, p = 0.637). However, ICD-11 cases had higher odds
of a comorbid depressive or anxiety disorder diagnosis than
ICD-10-only cases in the 122–456 days time interval (OR 2.34,
95% CI 1.16–4.76, p = 0.014 for depressive disorders; and OR
2.48, 95% CI 1.23–5.09, p = 0.009 for anxiety disorders); 65.9%
of ICD-11 cases and 45.1% of ICD-10-only cases met MINI diag-
nostic criteria for a depressive disorder during this time interval.
Similarly, 63.3% of ICD-11 cases and 40.9% of ICD-10-only cases
met MINI diagnostic criteria for an anxiety disorder during this
time interval.
Studies’ heterogeneity
A study-by-study analysis for the 0–60 days time interval, shown
in Fig. 2, demonstrated a mixture of statistically significant and
insignificant results, with no heterogeneity in terms of effects
size and direction (I2 = 0%). Utilizing a fixed-effects model, an
ICD-10-only classification had a mean decrease of 17.33 points
on the CAPS total severity score relative to the ICD-11 (95% CI
15.01–19.65). The random-effects model’s results were not
different.

 A study-by-study analysis (Fig. 2) for the 122–456 days time
interval had moderate heterogeneity (I2 = 61%), with one study
demonstrating a higher mean CAPS total severity score for the
ICD-10-only group. However, utilizing a random-effects model,
mean CAPS total severity score for the ICD-10-only group was
still 16.85 points lower than the ICD-11 group’s mean CAPS
total severity score (95% CI 10.10–23.61).
Discussion
The results of this study indicate that the ICD-11 consistently
identifies fewer and more severe cases across time using both
the more stringent and the more permissive re-experiencing cri-
teria. Almost all the participants meeting ICD-11 PTSD diagnos-
tic criteria also met ICD-10 criteria. About one-third to one-half
of those meeting ICD-10 diagnostic criteria were not eligible for
an ICD-11 diagnosis. They nonetheless reported moderate
PTSD symptomology. These results were consistent after account-
ing for both the ICD-11 impairment and duration criteria, as well
as potential heterogeneity of studies.
Both the disparity and the overlap in these data are consistent
with the findings from previous literature examining the overlap
in ICD-10 and ICD-11, e.g. 37.3% with ICD-10 PTSD v. 22.4%
with ICD-11 PTSD in a sample of adolescents and young adults
exposed to a mass shooting (Haravuori et al. 2016); 49.4% with
ICD-10 PTSD v. 39.8% with ICD-11 PTSD among survivors of
institutional abuse (Gluck et al. 2016); or 46.2% ICD-10 PTSD

One explanation for the exclusion of ICD-10 cases by the
ICD-11 may lie in the omission of several symptom criteria by
ICD-11. In addition to excluding cognitive and affective symp-
toms previously recognized by both the ICD-10 and the
DSM-5, the ICD-11 omits sleep disturbances and intense reac-
tions to reminders (i.e. intense psychological distress at exposure
to reminders, physiologic reactivity upon exposure to reminders
without dissociative episode). These restrictions intentionally
eliminate more diverse symptom presentations, effectively exclud-
ing PTSD cases previously identified under less stringent criteria.
Participants identified by the ICD-11 reported more severe
symptoms than those identified by ICD-10. This finding is con-
sistent with those of other studies: Both Gluck et al. (2016) and
Haravuori et al. (2016) found that the cases identified by the
ICD-11 were substantially more severe than those identified by
the ICD-10. Importantly, participants identified by the ICD-10
criteria alone (i.e. excluded from ICD-11 diagnoses) had CAPS
scores indicative of moderate PTSD symptoms and thus would
require clinical attention (Weathers et al. 1999; Blake et al.
2000). Furthermore, participants identified by the ICD-10 alone
had the same or lower likelihood of being diagnosed with a
depressive or anxiety disorder, suggesting that alternative disor-
ders do not account for the disparity in PTSD diagnoses. Using
the ICD-11 to adjudicate treatment eligibility or coverage, there-
fore, might inappropriately restrict treatment access to many
affected trauma survivors who may not be captured by other diag-
noses. Though in line with ICD-11 declared goals of improving
diagnostic specificity (Brewin, 2013; Maercker and Perkonigg,
2013), the resulting restriction warrants caution.
Observing participants’ PTSD classification over time revealed
similar long-term outcome for both groups, expressed by similar
rates of recovery and migration between diagnostic categories.
Thus, the prognoses of those identified by ICD-11 and those

 identified by ICD-10 alone are relatively similar, the main differ-
ence lying in the severity of the individuals identified.
The use of the ICD-11 diagnostic criteria may also affect PTSD
research, as they clearly restrict the group identified as having
PTSD. This pattern of findings raises critical questions about
the implications of the proposed ICD-11 definition of PTSD for
research into this phenotype. In line with this idea, Stein et al.
(2014) propose that restricting research to a narrowly defined
phenotype (i.e. to either ICD-11, ICD-10, DSM-IV, or DSM-5
alone) is counterproductive because it presumes a priori assump-
tions of better homogeneity; they recommend that parsing
research samples into homogenous subsets should follow empir-
ical evidence optimally obtained by ‘broadly defined’ inclusion
and subsequent testing of, among others, ICD-11 restrictions’
contribution to samples homogeneity.
This study was not free of limitations. First, the samples used
in this study were not originally evaluated for ICD-10 or ICD-11
PTSD, and the measure used to derive these diagnoses was based
on the DSM-IV template. At this point, however, items on the
CAPS offer the best available approximation of ICD-10 and
ICD-11 criteria, and in the absence of ICD-dedicated structured
interviews, their use has been an unavoidable drawback across
studies and recommendations to date (Brewin, 2013; Knefel and
Lueger-Schuster, 2013; Gluck et al. 2016).
Second, this study used a 0–60 days time interval, resulting in
very early CAPS assessments in many participants. ICD-11
criteria require that symptoms persist for several weeks.
Consequently, assessment within the 0–60 days time interval,
while indicative of early differences between ICD-10 and
ICD-11 symptom templates, is not properly indicative of
PTSD. However, we employed a 22–60 days time interval as a
sensitivity analysis in order to examine the diagnostic rates of
each ICD template while accounting for the minimum duration
criterion and found consistent results regardless of the duration
criterion.
Third, most of the study’s participants were road traffic acci-
dent survivors, and others had undergone a single, salient
event. The range of traumatic events studied may limit the gener-
alizability of the study’s results to other traumatic circumstances.
Furthermore, measures of trauma severity, a difficult construct to
measure, were not systematically administered and therefore were
not included as a contributing factor.
Finally, the dataset used in this study did not include sufficient
data to create variables representing diagnoses of complex PTSD
(CPTSD), a sub-category of PTSD, or persistent grief disorder
(PGD) as outlined by the ICD-11 (Maercker and Znoj, 2010;
Cloitre et al. 2013; Maercker and Perkonigg, 2013). CPTSD cri-
teria, however, require that all ICD-11 PTSD criteria be met,
and therefore participants identified by ICD-10 alone would not
have received CPTSD diagnosis. It is also unlikely that PGD
would have compensated for the disparity between ICD-10 and
ICD-11 diagnostic rates given that our sample represented mostly

 individuals who had experienced first-hand, non-interpersonal
traumas.
The results of this study indicate that the proposed ICD-11 cri-
teria do identify the more severe cases of PTSD. They nonetheless
do not identify a substantial number of individuals with moderate
symptoms who may not be captured or better classified by other
diagnoses. As such, the use of ICD-11 criteria to sanction access
to care should be considered cautiously, and their utility for
research should be empirically validated. A clear advantage of
the ICD template over the DSM routine is that its criteria are
not as sharply positioned as essential determinants of construct
boundaries and case identifiers, and thus leaving no space for
medical expertise and experience. It would be, therefore, in the
best ICD tradition to cautiously implement the new PTSD tem-
plate and refrain from misusing it to define clinical caseness.
