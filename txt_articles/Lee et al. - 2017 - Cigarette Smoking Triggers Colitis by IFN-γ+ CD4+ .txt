The increased incidence of Crohn’s disease in smokers has been recently reported, 
suggesting a strong association of cigarette smoke (CS) with colitis. However, the mech-
anism of the action of CS on colitis has not yet been explored. Here, we demonstrate that 
CS exposure is sufficient to induce colitis in mice. Interestingly, the colitis is mainly medi-
ated by Th1, but not Th17, responses. CD4+ T-cell depletion or T-bet/IFN-γ deficiency 
protects against the development of colitis induced by CS. Additionally, IFN-γ-producing 
CD4+ T cells play a substantial role in CS-induced colitis. The adoptive transfer (AT) of 
effector T cells from CS-exposed WT mice into colitis-prone mice caused these mice to 
develop colitis, while the AT of effector T cells from IFN-γ knock-out mice did not. These 
findings have implications for broadening our understanding of CS-induced pathology 
and for the development of novel therapeutic strategies to treat Crohn’s disease.

Cigarette smoking is blamed for the death of approximately six million people globally every year 
(1). Although the knowledge of the risks posed by cigarette smoking has been well documented, 
the worldwide prevalence of cigarette consumption is estimated to be in excess of one billion 
persons (2, 3). Studies have implicated cigarette smoking as a significant risk factor for a number 
of chronic disorders, such as respiratory (4), cerebrovascular (5), and cardiovascular diseases (6, 7). 
To date, there are increasing numbers of reports suggesting a link between cigarette smoking and 
colitis. Cigarette smoke (CS) has been established as the most robust risk factor for Crohn’s disease 
 
(8, 9), and the rates of Crohn’s disease incidence are significantly increased in people with air-
way diseases (10). Despite these clinical and epidemiological observations that link CS exposure 
 
with Crohn’s disease, a few experimental investigations have been undertaken to explore the role of 
CS in intestinal homeostasis and the underlying mechanisms mediating the effects of CS on Crohn’s 
disease still remain unclear.
IFN-γ, a prototypical Th1/Tc1 cytokine, plays a pivotal role in the regulation of various immune 
responses, including leukocyte trafficking, microbicidal effector activation, pathogen recognition, 
antigen presentation, and cellular proliferation (11, 12). However, the overexpression of this 
weighty cytokine is involved in many gastric diseases, including autoimmune gastritis (13), celiac 
disease (14), and Crohn’s disease (15), as well as pulmonary inflammation (16).
To investigate the mechanisms mediating the effects of CS exposure on colitis, we examined 
whether CS exposure can induce colitis as well as lung inflammation. As expected, CS exposure 
caused lung inflammation-mediated Th1 and Th17 responses. Notably, CS exposure was enough 
to induce colitis and this colitis was mainly mediated by the Th1 response, not the Th17 response.

We validated the role of the Th1 response in CS exposure-induced 
colitis using specific CD4+/8+ T-cell depletion or IFN-γ/T-bet 
knock-out mice. Finally, we confirmed that IFN-γ plays a 
substantial role in colitis induced by lung draining lymph node 
CD4+CD25− T-cell adoptive transfer (AT) in colitis-prone mice.

Mice
C57BL/6J WT, IFN-γ−/− (B6.129S7-Ifngtm1Ts/J), IL-10−/− 
(B6.129P2-Il10tm1Cgn/J), and CRISPR/Cas9 knock-in (B6J.129 
(Cg)-Gt (ROSA) 26Sortm1.1(CAG-cas9*,-EGFP) Fezh/J: WTEGFP) mice 
were purchased from the Jackson Laboratory (Bar Harbor, ME, 
USA). T-bet−/− (Tbox21) mice were provided by Dr. Laurie 
Glimcher (Department of Immunology and Infection Diseases, 
Harvard School of Public Health). All mice were housed in 
cages maintained under pathogen-free conditions with air 
conditioning, a 12 h light and 12 h dark cycle and were pro-
vided with food and water ad libitum. The study was approved 
by the Kyung Hee University animal care and use committee. 
All of the experiments were performed in accordance with the 
approved animal protocols and guidelines established by Kyung 
Hee University [KHUASP (SE)-12-015]. All experiments used 
females that were 7–9 weeks old.
cs exposure
This study was performed using previously described experi-
mental procedures, which expose mice to mainstream of CS 
(17, 18). The mice were exposed to the smoke from five con-
secutive non-filtered cigarettes (Reference 3R4F without filter; 
University of Kentucky, Lexington, KY, USA) four times a 
day, 6 days per week, using a smoking apparatus described by 
previously (18). Female C57BL/6J WT, T-bet−/−, IFN-γ−/−, and 
WTEGFP mice were exposed to CS for 4 weeks, and CD4+ and 
CD8+ depletion, immune cell profiling in lamina propria (LP), 
hemoccult test and A4B7+ cell analysis studies were performed 
under 2 week CS exposure. All mice were sacrificed 24 h after 
the last CS exposure.
cytometric Bead array (cBa) assay
The ascending part of the colon was homogenized with a 
pro 
tease inhibitor cocktail (Roche Diagnostics, Mannheim, 
Germany) and centrifuged at 10,000 × g for 15 min at 4°C. 
The colon homogenates were assayed for Th1, Th2, and Th17 
using a CBA (BD Sciences, San Diego, CA, USA) using a BD 
FACSCalibur flow cytometer (BD Sciences).
enzyme-linked immunosorbent  
assay (elisa)
The bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL) fluid was immediately col-
lected after the mice were sacrificed. The lungs were lavaged and 
pooled three times with 1 ml of ice-cold PBS. The obtained BAL 
fluid was centrifuged at 3,000 × g for 10 min at 4°C, and the 
supernatants (BAL fluid) stored at −80°C. The Th1 cytokines, 
IFN-γ and TNF-α, were measured using a quantitative sandwich 
ELISA kit (IFN-γ, and TNF-α; BD Sciences) according to the 
manufacturer’s protocol. The optical density was measured 
at 450 nm using a microplate reader (SoftMax Pro software; 
Sunnyvale, CA, USA). The optical densities obtained for IFN-γ 
and TNF-α were each divided by the total protein concentra-
tions of the respective BAL fluid samples for standardization 
purposes. The total protein concentrations were determined 
using a Bio-Rad protein assay (Bio-Rad, Hercules, CA, USA) 
according to the manufacturer’s protocol.
Quantitative real-time Pcr (qrT-Pcr) 
assay
Total RNA was prepared from frozen colon tissue homogenates 
with an easy-BLUE™ RNA extraction kit (iNtRON Biotech., 
Sungnam, Republic of Korea). The cDNA synthesis was carried 
out for at 42°C and 5 min at 94°C using a cDNA synthesis kit 
(Bioneer Corporation., Daejeon, Republic of Korea). qRT-PCR 
for IFN-γ and TNF-α was performed with a SYBR Green I master 
mix using a Lightcycler® 480 system (Roche, Basel, Switzerland) 
as previously described in Jung et al. (19). The IFN-γ, TNF-α, 
and β-actin genes were amplified using the following primers: 
IFN-γ: forward (F), 5′-TCA AGT GCG ATA GAT GTG GAA 
GAA-3′ and reverse (R), 5′-TGG CTC TGC AGG ATT TTC 
ATG-3′, TNF-α: F, 5′-CAT CTT CTC AAA ATT CGA GTG ACA 
A-3′ and R, 5′-TGG GAG TAG ACA AGG TAC AAC CC-3′, and 
β-actin: F, 5′-AGA GGG AAA TCG GTG AC-3′ and R, 5′-CAA 
TAG TGA CCT GGC GCT-3′. IFN-γ and TNF-α expressions 
were normalized to β-actin expression (20).
Bal cell analysis
To perform BAL fluid collection, the mice were sacrificed 
and a tracheal cannula was slowly inserted. Three times via 
the tracheal cannula, 1 ml of ice-cold PBS was delivered and 
recovered by gentle manual aspiration. The collected BAL fluid 
was centrifuged at 3,000 × g for 10 min at 4°C, and the cell 
pellet was washed and finally resuspended in 1 ml of PBS. First, 
the total viable cells in the resulting pellet were counted using 
a trypan blue stain. To count the differential cells (neutrophils, 
macrophages, and lymphocytes), BAL fluid cells were adhered 
to glass slides using Cytospin (Sandon, Waltham, MA, USA) 
with Diff-Quick staining (Life Technologies., Auckland, New 
Zealand). The stained BAL cell slides were mounted with 
Canada balsam (Showa Chemical Co. Ltd., Tokyo, Japan). The 
BAL cells were counted under a light microscope as we pre-
viously reported (19, 21). The result was indicated as the cell 
number × 104.
Flow cytometer (Facs) analysis
The mesenteric lymph nodes (MLNs) were disrupted over a 
wire mesh screen. The colonic LP was isolated into a single-cell 
suspension as previously described in Bosurgi et al. (22). The 
lung was dissociated into a single-cell suspension using a mouse 
lung dissociation kit (Miltenyi Biotec, Bergisch Gladbach, 
Germany) with the gentle MACS™ dissociator, according to 
the manufacturer’s protocol. The red blood cells were lysed in 
BD Pharm Lyse™ lysing solution (BD Sciences). The single cells 
were stimulated in RPMI 1640 supplemented with 10% fetal

bovine serum, 50 UI/ml penicillin, and 50 µg/ml streptomycin 
(Hyclone, Logan, UT, USA) for 5 h with 50 ng/ml PMA/1 μg/ml 
Ionomycin (Sigma-Aldrich, St. Louis, MO, USA), respectively, 
in the presence of 0.66 µl/ml BD Golgistop™ protein transport 
inhibitor (BD Sciences). Intracellular IFN-γ and surface marker 
CD4 were assessed using a Mouse Th1/Th2/Th17 Phenotyping 
Kit (BD Sciences) following the manufacturer’s instructions. 
The stimulated cells were incubated with the following antibod-
ies: CD4-FITC, IFN-γ-PE, and IL-17A-APC (e-Bioscience, San 
Diego, CA, USA). To examine production of IFN-γ in CD4, 
CD8, or NK cells, splenocytes were stimulated for 5 h with 
PMA, Ionomycin, and BD Golgistop™. The cells fixed and 
stained with cell surface marker CD4-PE, CD8-APC, or NK1.1-
FITC (e-Bioscience). Then, intracellular IFN-γ was stained. 
 
To elucidate the effect of CS exposure on immune cell popula-
tion in colonic LP, single cells from colonic LP were stained 
with the following antibodies: B220-PE, CD4-FITC, CD4-APC, 
CD8-APC, CD11b-APC, CD25-PE, CD45-FITC, F480-FITC, 
and Gr1-PE (e-Bioscience). To examine an expression of A4B7, 
single cells from blood and spleen were stained with CD4-APC 
and A4B7-PE (e-Bioscience) antibodies. All of the sample data 
were acquired by a FACSCalibur flow cytometer using Cell 
Quest Pro software (BD Sciences) and generated in graphical 
and tabular formats using FlowJo software (Tree Star Inc., 
Ashland, OR, USA).
cD4+ T-cell and cD8+ T-cell Depletion
mAbs were used for the in vivo depletion of CD4+ and CD8+ 
T-cell subsets. The C57BL/6J WT mice were injected once with 
500 µg i.p. antimouse CD4 Abs (clone 2.43), CD8 Abs (clone 
GK1.5), or rat IgG (Sigma-Aldrich) every 3 days from days 3 
to 11, in 3-day intervals. The efficacy of CD4+ T-cell and/or 
CD8+ T-cell depletion was analyzed using a FACSCalibur flow 
cytometer.
Purified cD4+cD25− T cells aT
CD4+CD25− T cells were highly purified from the lung draining 
lymph nodes of WT and IFN-γ−/− mice using the CD4+CD25+ 
T cells Treg isolation kit and magnetic bead separation (Miltenyi 
Biotec). The purity of the isolated cells was analyzed by flow 
cytometry prior to AT (>88% of the CD4+ cells were CD25−). The 
isolated CD4+CD25− T cells (5 × 105/mouse) were suspended in 
200 µl PBS and injected via i.v. into IL-10−/− mice. After 14 days 
of the AT, the mice were sacrificed.
histologic analysis
The mice were transcardially perfused with a saline solution con-
taining 0.5% sodium nitrate and heparin (10 U/ml). The lungs 
and colons were removed from the perfused mice, fixed with 
10% neutral-buffered formalin (IMEB Inc., San Marcos, CA, 
USA), and embedded in paraffin. A section of the lung (4-µm 
thick) and transverse colons (7-µm thick) from each mouse 
were stained with hematoxylin and eosin and visualized on an 
Olympus BX51 microscope (Olympus, Tokyo, Japan) equipped 
with a DP71 digital camera (Olympus). A total histological 
score of the lung was calculated for each mouse as described 
previously (18). Briefly, the lung sections were scored from 
 
0 to 5 by readers according to the following criteria: 0 = normal; 
1 = very mild; 2 = mild; 3 = moderate; 4 = marked; 5 = severe 
inflammation. The lung sections were examined under 200× 
magnifications to quantify the mean alveolar airspace (MAA). 
MAA was a quantitative assessment of lung structure that 
was determined by dividing the sum of the alveolar airspace 
areas divided by the number of identified alveoli using Image 
Pro-Plus 5.1 software (Media Cybernetics, Inc., Silver Spring, 
MD, USA). The colon sections were assigned a score from 0 to 
3 as described previously (23). The histological analyses were 
performed in a blinded fashion.
statistical analysis
All of the values are presented as the mean ± SEM. The statisti-
cal significance (p < 0.05 for all analyses) was assessed using 
two-tailed Student’s t-test for single comparisons or by two-way 
ANOVA with repeated measures using Prism 5.01 software 
(Graphpad Software Inc., San Diego, CA, USA).
resUlTs
chronic cs exposure is sufficient for the 
induction of Th1-Mediated colitis
First, we wanted to examine whether CS exposure could induce 
Crohn’s disease-like illness. Therefore, we exposed the mice 
to CS as described in a previous study (18) and evaluated the 
impact of CS exposure in the bowel. The colon length was 
significantly shorter (air group: 77.1 ± 2.3 mm vs. CS group: 
56.8 ± 0.8 mm, Figure 1A) and the body weight was mark-
edly reduced (Figure 1B) by CS exposure after 4 weeks of CS 
exposure. Histologic analysis confirmed that CS exposure 
significantly increased the infiltration of inflammatory cells in 
the submucosa, epithelial cell hyperplasia, and mucus thick-
ness in the ascending colon (Figures 1E,F). The immune cell 
subset analysis in the LP demonstrated that the neutrophils 
and macrophages were predominantly increased upon CS 
exposure (Figure S1A in Supplementary Material). In addition, 
the fecal occult blood test showed that CS exposure for 2 weeks 
was enough to cause bleeding (Figure S1B in Supplementary 
Material). These results indicated that CS exposure could cause 
colitis. Next, we wanted to know whether CS exposure-induced 
colitis resembles Crohn’s disease (Th1/Th17-dominant colitis) or 
ulcerative colitis (Th2 dominant colitis). We evaluated cytokine 
production in inflamed regions in the bowel and found that 
the production of Th1 cytokines such as IFN-γ and TNF-α was 
highly increased (37.4- and 3.1-fold higher, respectively), while 
the production of none of the Th2/17 cytokines, including IL-4 
and IL-17A, was increased, indicating that CS exposure-induced 
colitis resembles Crohn’s disease (Figures 1C,D). To confirm the 
Th1/17 responses in CS exposure-induced colitis, we analyzed 
the intracellular expression of IFN-γ and IL-17A on CD4+ 
T cells in MLNs and colonic LP. The results demonstrated that 
CS exposure significantly increased Th1 but not Th17 in both 
MLNs and colonic LP, suggesting that CS exposure specifically 
induces Th1-mediated bowel inflammation (Figures 1G–J).

chronic cs exposure induces lung 
inflammation
We have repeatedly shown that CS exposure develops lung 
inflammation in mice (18, 24). As expected, the mice with CS 
exposure-induced colitis also showed signs of lung inflammation. 
A massive recruitment of inflammatory cells was observed in the 
entire lung, especially around the bronchial and peribronchial 
layers in the CS-exposed mice (Figure 2C). Likewise, alveolar 
wall destruction was also observed in their lung tissue, which 
resulted in enlarged airspaces (Figures 2E,F). Infiltrated immune

for 2 weeks. (a) Th1 and Th17 cells were analyzed by flow cytometry (gated on CD4+ and CD8+ T cells, respectively). The mice received anti-CD4 and anti-CD8

flow cytometry. (c) The colon length was measured, and (D) the concentration of IFN-γ and TNF-α were evaluated in ascending colon tissue homogenate using

mice were counted using Diff-Quick staining. (F) The concentrations of the Th1 cytokines IFN-γ and TNF-α in the BAL fluid were determined by using enzyme-linked

##p < 0.01, and #p < 0.05, and not significant; ns).

cells reflecting pathological changes in lung parenchyma (25) 
were also markedly increased in the CS exposure group com-
pared to the air exposure group (Figure 2E). We attempted to 
determine the involvement of Th1 and Th17 responses in lung 
inflammation induced by CS exposure because the Th1 response, 
but not the Th17 response, was observed in colonic inflamma-
tion as triggered by the same stimuli. Interestingly, the results 
showed that CS exposure activated both Th1 and Th17 responses 
in the lung, unlike in the bowel (Figures 2A,B,D).
cs exposure-induced colitis and  
lung inflammation are Mediated  
Mainly by cD4+ T cells
As IFN-γ and IL-17A are secreted both in CD4+ T cells and 
CD8+ T cells (26), we wanted to know which T-cell subtype 
mediated the CS exposure-induced inflammation in the colon 
and lung. When mice were exposed to CS, a significantly 
increased IFN-γ+CD4+ T-cell population was observed in 
the MLNs, colonic LP, and lung, but there was no significant 
increase in the IFN-γ+CD8+ T-cell population (Figure 3A). 
 
In addition, IFN-γ producing in CD4+ T cells in splenocytes was 
significantly increased upon CS exposure, not in CD8+ T and 
NK cells (Figure S1C in Supplementary Material). In the case 
of IL-17A+-secreting T cells, there was a significant increase 
in IL-17A+CD4+ T cells in the lung but not in the colon. There 
was no difference in IL-17A+CD8+ T cells in the lung and colon 
(Figure 3A). To identify specific T-cell subsets involved in CS 
exposure-induced colitis, we depleted CD4+ T cells or CD8+ 
T cells prior to CS exposure (Figure 3B). CD4+ T cell depletion 
neutralized the effect of CS exposure on colonic length. It also 
strongly blocked the increase in IFN-γ and TNF-α expression 
 7

in the lung and the immune cell infiltration into the lung by CS 
exposure. In the colon, however, CD4+ T-cell depletion could 
not completely inhibit the increased expression of IFN-γ and 
TNF-α (Figures 3C–F). Although CD8+ T-cell depletion also 
affected colon length and the concentrations of IFN-γ and 
TNF-α expression in colon, the effect of CD4+ T-cell deple-
tion was superior to that of CD8+ T-cell depletion in both the 
colon and lung. These results indicate that CD4+ T cells are 
the major cell population that mediates CS exposure-induced 
inflammation in the colon and lung, although both CD4+/8+ 
T cell subsets are involved.
T-bet Deficiency Protects against the 
Development of colitis and chronic 
lung inflammation induced by cs 
exposure
T-bet is a Th1-specific transcription factor that regulates the 
production of IFN-γ in CD4+ T cells (27). As we observed the 
relevance of IFN-γ and the role of CD4+ T cells for CS-induced 
inflammation above, we exposed T-bet-deficient mice to 
CS for 4 weeks to assess the role of the Th1 response in CS 
exposure-induced colitis and lung inflammation. As shown in 
Figures 4A,B, T-bet−/+ mice showed a significant reduction in 
both the colon length and body weight following CS exposure; 
however, T-bet−/− mice exhibited significant protection against 
CS exposure-induced changes in colon length and body weight. 
Additionally, T-bet−/− mice showed unaltered expression of 
IFN-γ and TNF-α upon CS exposure, while T-bet−/+ mice 
showed significantly increased expression of IFN-γ and TNF-α 
following CS exposure in both colon and lung (Figures 4C,F). 
 
In T-bet−/− mice, CS exposure also blocked the effect on infiltrated 
immune cell numbers and inflammatory cytokine concentra-
tions (Figures 4D–F). These results indicate more clearly that 
CS-induced inflammatory responses are influenced by Th1 
responses.
iFn-γ Deficiency inhibits the Development 
of colitis and chronic lung inflammation 
induced by cs exposure
To confirm whether CS-induced inflammatory responses are 
IFN-γ dependent in the colon, we exposed IFN-γ-deficient 
mice to CS. The CS exposure caused a noticeable decline in the 
colon length and the body weight in IFN-γ−/+ mice. Meanwhile, 
the CS-exposed IFN-γ−/− mice demonstrated a significantly 
improved colon length compared to the CS-exposed IFN-γ−/+ 
mice (Figure 5A). Protection from body weight loss by IFN-γ 
deficiency was observed from day 22 (Figure 5B). CS exposure 
caused the IFN-γ−/+ mice to express highly increased concentra-
tions of IFN-γ and TNF-α in the colon and lung, while no IFN-γ 
was detected in IFN-γ−/− mice, as expected (Figures 5C,D). 
IFN-γ deficiency significantly inhibited immune cell infiltrations 
into the lung by CS exposure (Figure 5E). Interestingly, IFN-γ 
deficiency decreased CS exposure-induced secretion of TNF-α 
in the colon and also protected the lung from inflammation by 
CS exposure (Figures 5D–F).
iFn-γ Plays a substantial role in colitis, 
Which is induced by the aT of lung 
Draining lymph node cD4+cD25−  
T cells in colitis-Prone il-10−/− Mice
To confirm the role of IFN-γ in the induction of colitis via 
CS-stimulated CD4+ T cells, we performed an AT of lung drain-
ing lymph node CD4+CD25− T cells from WT or IFN-γ−/− mice to 
colitis-prone IL-10−/− mice (Figure 6A) (28). Fourteen days later, 
after the AT of isolated lung draining lymph node CD4+CD25− 
T cells from WT mice, body weight loss was observed in IL-10−/− 
mice (Figure 6C), but the same cells adoptively transferred 
from IFN-γ−/− mice did not cause body weight loss (Figure 6F). 
The AT of WT cells shortened colon length (Figure 6B) and 
increased IFN-γ and TNF-α expression (Figure 6D); however, 
the AT of IFN-γ-deficient cells did not cause those changes 
(Figures 6E,G), indicating that IFN-γ producing CS-exposed 
CD4+ T cells play a substantial role in inducing colitis. We also 
examined an expression of gut homing integrin, A4B7, in CD4+ 
T cells (29). When we check it in the blood and spleen, CS expo-
sure increased the expression of A4B7 in CD4+ T cells (Figure 
S1D in Supplementary Material).

T cells from cs exposure Mice Migrate 
into colon in il-10−/− Mice
To follow the migration of CS-stimulated CD4+ T cells into 
colon, we performed an AT of lung draining lymph node 
CD4+CD25− T cells from WTEGFP to IL-10−/− mice. The IL-10−/− 
mice which received the AT of CS-stimulated lung draining 
lymph CD4+CD25− T cells observed a significant increase the 
population of CD4+ T cells in MLNs and colon compared to the 
Air group (Figures 7A,E). However, the other tissues including 
lung, lung draining lymph, and spleen did not show increase 
in CD4+ population (Figures 7B–D). Altogether, these data 
demonstrated that CS stimulates CD4+CD25− T cells migra-
tion from lung draining lymph node to MLNs and colon in 
IL-10−/− mice.
DiscUssiOn
Cigarette smoking appears to play a major role in the patho-
genesis of Crohn’s disease as well as pulmonary diseases (30). 
Epidemiological studies have provided strong evidence to 
confirm the increased incidence of Crohn’s disease in smokers. 
Multiple mechanisms may be responsible for the association of 
CS and colitis. CS reportedly increases the levels of pro-inflam-
matory cytokines, including IL-1, IL-6, IL-8, and TNF-α, and 
decreases those of anti-inflammatory cytokines such as IL-10 
(31). Moreover, Petrescu et al. demonstrated a positive corre-
lation between serum levels of TNF-α and CS exposure (32). 
 
We previously could also observe markedly increased inflam-
mation in the colon following CS exposure (33). Notably, IFN-γ 
is highly expressed following CS exposure, although there was 
little change in the levels of IL-2, IL-4, IL-6, IL-10, and IL-17A 
in the colon.

IFN-γ-targeted therapy has been attempted and appears to 
be effective in the treatment of Crohn’s disease (34). It is well 
established that IFN-γ regulates intestinal epithelial homeostasis 
(35) and that IFN-γ-deficient mice exhibit a less severe progres-
sion of experimental colitis (36). Consistent with these reports, 
we showed here that the IFN-γ/Th1 cell-specific transcription

factor T-bet is strongly involved in CS-induced colitis. CS 
exposure induced T-bet/IFN-γ-mediated colitis in normal mice. 
Indeed, the results are in agreement with the traditional notion 
that CS exposure boosts Crohn’s disease associated with a Th1 
cytokine profile. The Th1/Th17 interaction is deeply associated 
with colitis (37, 38), IFN-γ inhibits the Th17 responses by block-
ing IL-23 expression in colitis (39). Additionally, the microbial 
flora affects the immune responses in the gut and CS seems to 
have an influence on the gastrointestinal microbiota (40). This 
microenvironmental difference may explain why IL-17A was 
detected in the lung but not in MLNs or colonic LP as well as in 
the ascending colon in our experiments.
Experiments using CD4+ T-cell or CD8+ T-cell depletion 
showed that the CD4+ T cell is a major cell subset causing 
CS-induced colitis, and other cells such as CD8+ T cells also 
have a role in this process. CS exposure failed to induce coli-
tis in T-bet- or IFN-γ-knock-out mice, although there was a 
slight inflammatory tendency. These results suggest that CS 
exposure may induce colitis via Th1 responses, but the mech-
anisms are incompletely understood, with the exception of 
 
the Th1-mediated mechanism underlying the immune imbal-
ance in colitis and the involvement of CS. In addition, it is 
still unclear what the relation between CS-induced colitis and 
ulcerative colitis is. In a previous study, CS showed a protec-
tive effect against ulcerative colitis (41) and is thought to 
have protective effects against the development of ulcerative 
colitis associated with Th2-mediated disease (42). According 
our results, it is possible that CS may protect from ulcera-
tive colitis via the downregulation of Th2 responses via Th1 
responses.

Previous animal studies investigating the effect of CS expo-
sure on gut have shown conflicting results. Zuo et al. showed 
that CS is associated with intestinal barrier dysfunction in the 
small intestine but not in the colon (43). They used BALB/C, 
prototypical Th2-type mouse strain while we used C57BL/6 
prototypical Th1-type strain. Different T-cell differentiation 
between these mouse strains may affect the development of 
inflammation in the small intestine and colon (44). Montbarbon 
et al. reported that CS exposure for 3 weeks did not induced 
colitis but increased only several cytokines including IL-10 and 
IL-13 (45). They claimed that CS exposure recruit invariant 
natural killer T cells in the colon, and these cells can protect 
tissue from DSS induced colonic inflammation. However, they 
also showed that CS exposure increased mRNA expression of 
inflammatory cytokines including TNF, IFN-γ, IL-17, and IL-21 
in Ja18−/− mice and escalated clinical symptoms of DSS-induced 
colitis in CD1d−/− mice. As it is hard with CS alone to induce 
severe inflammation on gut, many studies have used chemically 
induced colitis models to study the impact of CS exposure on gut 
inflammation (46). However, in our experiment, CS alone could 
induce histological change of colon and increased expression of 
inflammatory cytokines including IFN-γ and TNF-α. The dis-
similarities between researches may be explained by differences 
in the methods of CS simulation.
Verschuere et al. showed that CS exposure alone increases 
apoptosis in the follicle-associated epithelium and is associated 
with immune cells including dendritic cells, CD4+ T cells, and 
CD8+ T cells accumulation in Peyer’s patches. They examined 
the effect on the gut-associated lymphoid tissue of the small 
intestine, Peyer’s patches in particular, because of the known 
relationship between CS and Crohn’s ileitis (47).
In conclusion, we unveiled the role of IFN-γ+ CD4+ T cells 
on CS-mediated colitis in animal model. Our findings identify 
a novel mechanism of CS-induced colitis: the mediation of 
immune activation via T-bet/IFN-γ-mediated CD4+ T cells. 
IFN-γ plays a substantial role in colitis induced by CS exposure. 
 
An understanding of the T-bet/IFN-γ-mediated CD4+ T cell 
changes in the colon extends our understanding of CS-induced 
pathology, which may result in the development of novel thera-
peutic strategies to treat Crohn’s disease.
