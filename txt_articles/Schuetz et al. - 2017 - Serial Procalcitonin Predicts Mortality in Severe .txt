Objectives: To prospectively validate that the inability to decrease 
procalcitonin levels by more than 80% between baseline and 
day 4 is associated with increased 28-day all-cause mortality 
in a large sepsis patient population recruited across the United 
States.
Design: Blinded, prospective multicenter observational clinical trial 
following an Food and Drug Administration-approved protocol.
Setting: Thirteen U.S.-based emergency departments and ICUs.
Patients: Consecutive patients meeting criteria for severe sepsis 
or septic shock who were admitted to the ICU from the emer-
gency department, other wards, or directly from out of hospital 
were included.
Interventions: Procalcitonin was measured daily over the first 5 
days.
Measurements and Main Results: The primary analysis of interest 
was the relationship between a procalcitonin decrease of more

than 80% from baseline to day 4 and 28-day mortality using Cox 
proportional hazards regression. Among 858 enrolled patients, 
646 patients were alive and in the hospital on day 4 and included 
in the main intention-to-diagnose analysis. The 28-day all-cause 
mortality was two-fold higher when procalcitonin did not show a 
decrease of more than 80% from baseline to day 4 (20% vs 10%; 
p = 0.001). This was confirmed as an independent predictor in 
Cox regression analysis (hazard ratio, 1.97 [95% CI, 1.18–3.30; 
 
p < 0.009]) after adjusting for demographics, Acute Physiology 
and Chronic Health Evaluation II, ICU residence on day 4, sepsis 
syndrome severity, antibiotic administration time, and other rel-
evant confounders.
Conclusions: Results of this large, prospective multicenter U.S. 
study indicate that inability to decrease procalcitonin by more than 
80% is a significant independent predictor of mortality and may 
aid in sepsis care. (Crit Care Med 2017; 45:781–789)

E
arly diagnosis and initiation of resuscitation measures, 
antibiotic treatment and/or source control remains the 
cornerstone of sepsis care (1). Once treatment is initi-
ated, close monitoring of sepsis patients is of utmost impor-
tance to identify patients with adverse disease course who 
may require alternative therapeutic approaches. Secondarily, 
monitoring may identify patients with a favorable course tra-
jectory who are at low risk for complications warranting dis-
charge from the ICU and possibly deescalation of antibiotic 
therapy. Appropriate deescalation of the intensity of care with 
transfer to the floor setting is an important decision because 
ICU readmissions due to treatment failure on the floor are 
associated with adverse prognosis and prolonged in-hospital 
stay (2). Daily assessment of patient risk using objective prog-
nostic data may aid in these intensification and deescalation 
decisions.
In addition to clinical signs and symptoms, blood markers 
may assist in patient monitoring (3–6). While serum lactic acid 
is a biomarker commonly used to help guide response to resus-
citation measures (7), procalcitonin (PCT) has been previously 
demonstrated to be helpful in antibiotic stewardship decisions 
(8–10). PCT is a host-response marker that is up-regulated by 
microbial toxins and certain proinflammatory mediators (e.g., 
interleukin-1b, tumor necrosis factor-α, interleukin-6) and is 
down-regulated during recovery (11). The expression of PCT 
is attenuated by the cytokines typically released in response to 
a viral infection (e.g., interferon-γ); thus, an elevated PCT is 
typically indicative of a bacterial infection (12). In addition to 
its diagnostic value, the kinetics of PCT have also been shown 
to predict mortality and treatment failure in sepsis (13–19). 
In a recent retrospective analysis involving 256 sepsis patients 
from two ICUs in the United States, a lack of PCT decrease 
by more than 80% over the first 72 hours was associated with 
an increase in ICU and in-hospital mortality, independent of 
prognostic ICU risk scores (5).
Prior to this study, Food and Drug Administration (FDA) 
approved use of PCT was limited to single point measurement 
in the ICU. Therefore, we sought to expand the indication to 
apply to serial measurements of severe sepsis and septic shock 
patients, across all hospital settings. Herein, we performed a 
large, prospective U.S.-based multicenter study to validate the 
prognostic accuracy of an inability to decrease PCT by more 
than 80% from baseline to day 4 to predict 28-day mortality 
in patients with severe sepsis or septic shock who were being 
admitted to the ICU from the emergency department (ED) or 
other wards.
MATERIALS AND METHODS
Study Design
This report adheres to the Reporting of Observational trials 
(STrengthening the Reporting of OBservational studies in Epide-
miology) (20). The study protocol was approved by the U.S. FDA 
and registered at ClinicalTrials.gov (https://clinicaltrials.gov/ct2/
show/NCT01523717, Registration date: January 19, 2012).
Patients
Inclusion criteria for this study were adult patients (age, ≥ 18) 
who were diagnosed with severe sepsis or septic shock accord-
ing to adapted American College of Chest Physicians/Society 
of Critical Care Medicine criteria (21–23) (Supplemental 
trial definitions, Supplemental Digital Content 1, http://links.
lww.com/CCM/C411); patients treated in the ICU or a deci-
sion to admit the patient from the ED or other wards; blood 
sampling performed within 12 hours after diagnosis of severe 
sepsis or septic shock; and willingness to provide written 
informed consent. We excluded patients without initial blood 
draw and patients missing data regarding the primary out-
come (28-d mortality). For the intention-to-diagnose (ITD) 
analysis (analysis mandated by the FDA), patients who died 
or were discharged from the hospital prior to the day 4 blood 
draw were also excluded (Supplemental Fig. S1, Supplemental 
Digital Content 1, http://links.lww.com/CCM/C411). We con-
ducted a sensitivity analysis using the per-protocol population 
(PP) where we excluded patients who did not meet our sepsis 
definition or were not transferred to the ICU (Supplemental 
Fig. S1, Supplemental Digital Content 1, http://links.lww.com/
CCM/C411).
Data Collection
In addition to blood specimens, we collected clinical data 
obtained at admission and during the hospital stay. All par-
ticipating study centers had evidence-based sepsis protocols 
in place supported by the latest Surviving Sepsis Campaign 
guidelines for management of patients with severe sepsis and 
septic shock (24–26).
Primary Endpoint
The primary endpoint of this study was 28-day all-cause mor-
tality. To verify vital status, patients were followed during the 
hospital stay and contacted by telephone at day 28.

Sample Collection and PCT Measurement
Blood samples were collected within 12 hours after diagnosis 
of severe sepsis or septic shock and then daily for a total of 5 
days. PCT was measured with the B·R·A·H·M·S PCT sensitive 
KRYPTOR (B·R·A·H·M·S GmbH, Hennigsdorf, Germany) (27). 
We tested the prognostic accuracy of a lack in PCT decrease of 
more than 80% (ΔPCT in %) from baseline to day 4. Because 
in some patients PCT may still increase within the first 24 
hours before reaching the maximum level, we also investigated 
the kinetics from the maximum level on baseline or days 1–4 
(Supplemental trial definitions, Supplemental Digital Content 
1, http://links.lww.com/CCM/C411). In addition, we inves-
tigated the prognostic ability of baseline PCT levels as well as 
short-term kinetics of PCT from baseline to day 1 for mortality 
prediction.
Statistical Considerations
The primary study population was the ITD population. The 
analysis was repeated in the per-PP excluding patients with 
protocol violations (Supplemental Fig. S1, Supplemental 
Digital Content 1, http://links.lww.com/CCM/C411). Based 
on a previous study that identified a decrease in PCT by 
80% or lower as the best threshold for predicting mortal-
ity, we designed this study to validate this cutoff (5). There-
fore, we hypothesized a priori that an inability to decrease 
PCT by more than 80% from baseline to day 4 would pre-
dict 28-day all-cause mortality. Please see online supplement 
for the details of the statistical approach and sample size 
calculations.
RESULTS
Patient Population
From December 2011 to March 2014, 858 patients were 
enrolled in the study, with 38 patients excluded because of 
missing or withdrawn written informed consent, missing ini-
tial blood draw, or missing information regarding the primary 
outcome (Supplemental Fig. S1, Supplemental Digital Content 
1, http://links.lww.com/CCM/C411). There were another 174 
patients who were excluded due to a missing day 4 blood draw 
(median PCT value at baseline was 7.5 μg/L [interquartile 
range (IQR), 1.7–21.3 μg/L] for the 73 patients excluded due 
to death and 1.7 μg/L [IQR, 0.3–11.0 μg/L] for the 101 patients 
excluded due to hospital discharge prior to day 4 blood draw). 
The main ITD analysis included 646 patients.
Patients had a mean age of 64 years and 57% were male gen-
der. Infections were mainly community acquired (92%) and 
slightly more than half of the patients had severe sepsis (54%) 
when compared with septic shock (46%) (Table 1). Among the 
820 patients enrolled were 184 deaths for a 22% all-cause 28-day 
mortality rate. Among the 646 patients in the ITD population, 
there were a total of 107 deaths for a 17% overall 28-day mor-
tality rate. The median stay in the ICU was 4 days and patients 
stayed for a median of 11 days in the hospital. Table 1 shows 
detailed patient characteristics in the overall ITD population 
stratified by 28-day survival status. Supplemental Table S1 
(Supplemental Digital Content 1, http://links.lww.com/CCM/
C411) also shows baseline results in the per-PP and the overall 
population.

PCT Kinetics and 28-Day Mortality
In regard to the primary hypothesis, the mortality rate was 
nearly double for those who did not decrease their PCT by 
more than 80% from baseline to day 4 when compared with 
those who did decrease by more than 80% (20% vs 10%; p 
= 0.001) (Table 2). The prognostic measures at this cutoff 
showed a sensitivity of 77% (95% CI, 69–85%) with a speci-
ficity of 39% (35–43%), a negative predictive value of 90% 
(86–94%), and a positive predictive value of 20% (16–24%). 
In our sensitivity analysis, comparable results were obtained 
in the per-protocol patient population (Supplemental  
Fig. S2, 
a–c, Supplemental Digital Content 1, http://links.lww.com/
CCM/C411).
Kaplan-Meier and Cox Regression Analysis
Results were further analyzed in a time-to-event analysis. 
Figure 1 shows Kaplan-Meier plots for the overall population 
and stratified by patient location at day 4. Again, the 80% PCT 
decrease cutoff from baseline to day 4 significantly separated 
survivors from nonsurvivors.
To assess whether the PCT decrease provides prog-
nostic information beyond that of other clinical outcome

population (A), in patients in the ICU at day 4 (B) and in patients discharged 
from the ICU to the hospital ward on or prior to day 4 (C). (Per study meth-
odology patients were excluded who died or went home until day 4.)

predictors, we calculated multivariate Cox regression models 
including Acute Physiology and Chronic Health Evaluation 
(APACHE) II or maximum Sequential Organ Failure 
Assessment (SOFA) score, as well as nine clinical variables 
associated with severity and/or adverse outcome (appro-
priateness of antibiotic therapy, sepsis syndrome, microbi-
ology, nosocomial vs community infection, blood culture 
positivity, initial PCT level, age, gender, and patient location 
at day 4). In the unadjusted analysis, the hazard ratio (HR) 
for 28-day mortality of patients without a PCT decrease of 
more than 80% until day 4 was 2.05 (95% CI, 1.30–3.24) 
(Table 3). This result remained robust in the model includ-
ing adjustment for APACHE II and nine other variables 
with a HR of 1.97 (95% CI, 1.18–3.30; p < 0.01). Results 
were similar when using maximum SOFA score instead of 
APACHE II in the fully adjusted model (Supplemental Table 
S2, Supplemental Digital Content 1, http://links.lww.com/
CCM/C411). Furthermore, PCT remains a significant predic-
tor in models incorporating change in WBC count between 
baseline and day 4 (Supplemental Table S3, Supplemental 
Digital Content 1, http://links.lww.com/CCM/C411), as well 
as a model incorporating change in SOFA score between 
baseline and day 4 (Supplemental Table S4, Supplemental 
Digital Content 1, http://links.lww.com/CCM/C411). We 
also note that the maximum SOFA score over the first 4 
days (stratified by maximum SOFA, > 8) is also associated 
with a approximately two-fold mortality risk (Supplemental 
Table S2, Supplemental Digital Content 1, http://links.lww.
com/CCM/C411). We repeated the same analyses in the per-
protocol patient population and achieved comparable results 
(Supplemental Table S5, Supplemental Digital Content 1, 
http://links.lww.com/CCM/C411).
Secondary Analysis
Shorter Term Change in PCT (Baseline to Day 1) and Baseline 
PCT. In addition to the primary analysis where we analyzed the 
prognostic value of a PCT decrease of more than 80% between 
baseline and day 4, we assessed the prognostic value of a shorter 
term change of PCT between baseline and day 1. Among the 752 
patients available for analysis, patients who died have an average 
mean increase of 30% (95% CI, 15–47%) when compared with 
0% (95% CI, –7% to +6%) for those who survived (p < 0.001). 
The area under the curve (AUC) for the short-term increase was 
0.64 (95% CI, 0.59–0.69). When simply stratifying by patients 
with an initial increase in PCT from baseline to day 1 (n = 323) 
when compared with a decrease (n = 429), patients with a PCT 
increase had an almost three-fold higher mortality (mortality, 
29% vs 12%; p < 0.0001).
In addition to the concept of serial PCT measurements, we 
investigated the ability of a single PCT value to predict 28-day 
all-cause mortality at baseline (n = 820). Although nonsurvivors 
had higher mean baseline PCT levels compared with survivors

(5.2 μg/L [95% CI, 3.9–7.0 μg/L] vs 3.4 μg/L [95% CI, 2.8–4.0 
μg/L]; p < 0.02), a single PCT value at baseline was less predictive 
for 28-day mortality than serial measurements (Supplemental 
Table S6, Supplemental Digital Content 1, http://links.lww.com/
CCM/C411). The AUC for baseline PCT as a predictor of mor-
tality was 0.56 (95% CI, 0.51–0.60). Furthermore, when com-
paring the PCT values over the first 5 days among survivors 
versus nonsurvivors, the PCT values for the nonsurvivors were 
higher and stayed higher on all days 1–5 (Fig. 2).
Combined Initial PCT, PCT Change, and ICU Status. As 
an additional exploratory analysis requested by the FDA, we 
assessed whether the prognostic performance of our main 
covariate of interest, PCT reduction of more than 80% at day 4, 
was different when stratified by patient location at day 4 (ICU 
vs non-ICU) (Table 2). Mortality was higher in patients still 
hospitalized in the ICU at day 4 (26%) than in those patients 
already discharged to the floor at day 4 (9%). Among patients 
discharged from the ICU by day 4 who had a high baseline 
PCT value of greater than 2 μg/L, mortality was more than 
three-fold increased if PCT did not drop by more than 80% 
(19% vs 5%) (Supplemental Table S7, Supplemental Digital 
Content 1, http://links.lww.com/CCM/C411). Similarly, for 
patients still residing in the ICU at day 4 and low baseline PCT 
of less than or equal to 2 μg/L, mortality was about three-fold 
higher if PCT did not drop by more than 80% compared with 
PCT that decreased by more than 80% (26% vs 10%).
DISCUSSION
Within this large, multicenter study including 13 study sites 
across the United States, we found that kinetics of PCT over 
the first 4 days were predictive for survival of patients diag-
nosed with severe sepsis or septic shock. These results remained 
significant after multivariate adjustment for other known 
prognostic variables and risk factors. These findings validate 
previous retrospective research from the United States (5), as 
well as other smaller studies (14, 16–19). In addition to daily 
routine clinical assessment, monitoring of PCT in this patient 
population was demonstrated to aid in risk assessment, which 
may translate into better informed clinical decisions regarding 
intensification of care or ICU discharge.
Previous Related PCT Studies
Several studies have investigated the prognostic utility of PCT 
in systemic infection and sepsis (reviewed in [15]). In one 
retrospective analysis from the United States, PCT change 
over the first 72 hours was also a predictor for ICU and in-
hospital mortality in sepsis patients, independent of ICU risk 
scores (APACHE IV and Simplified Acute Physiology Score 
II) (5). In addition to general sepsis, studies also found PCT 
to improve risk stratification in respiratory infections, mainly 
community-acquired pneumonia and chronic obstructive pul-
monary disease exacerbation (15, 16). An individual patient 
data meta-analysis including more than 4,000 patients from 14 
trials found an association between admission PCT levels and 
treatment failure across different types of respiratory infec-
tions and treatment settings (16). In a large U.S. pneumonia 
cohort (28), the greatest benefit of PCT was found in patients 
classified as high risk by the pneumonia severity index. A PCT 
level less than 0.1 μg/L virtually excluded mortality in these 
high-risk patients. Our current analysis is in line with these 
previous investigations and supports the prognostic utility of 
PCT when measured serially.
Implications of Findings
Early recognition and the start of appropriate antibiotic treat-
ment, fluid resuscitation, source control, and close patient 
monitoring remain the cornerstone of care to lower sepsis 
related morbidity and mortality (1). In real-life practice, this 
remains challenging because clinical variables lack specificity 
for sepsis etiology and prognosis (29). Additionally, micro-
biologic diagnostics have low sensitivity and modalities such 
as cultures do not provide needed information in a timely 
fashion. Therefore, sepsis biomarkers are promising tools to 
help monitor patient response to therapy and may help guide 
therapeutic decisions in individual patients. It is particularly 
challenging during initial patient evaluation to determine 
which patients with sepsis will not respond well to therapeutic 
measures, and thus will have worsening of their clinical status. 
Specifically, the development of new or worsening organ dys-
function portends poor outcome and is a common pathway to 
death in these patients (30, 31). Novel strategies that improve 
a clinician’s ability to accurately risk stratify patients with sus-
pected sepsis facilitate early and appropriate therapeutic inter-
vention, improve important triage decisions (e.g., admission to 
the hospital vs discharge home, or admission to ICU vs non-
ICU bed, or continuation of care in the ICU vs discharge to 
the hospital ward), and provide a means to follow response to 
therapy, including antibiotic stewardship (32). PCT has gen-
erated much interest as a sepsis biomarker that is associated

with increased risk and severity of bacterial infection. PCT has 
also been found to correlate with risk of culture-proven bac-
teremia (33). Although the biological function of PCT in host 
defense is incompletely understood, this peptide influences the 
immune system in various ways including a decrease in phago-
cytic and candidacidal activity of neutrophils and also leads to 
an increase in the concentration of intracellular calcium ions 
(34, 35) which facilitate the host response.
Importantly, previous research demonstrates that PCT can 
be used to inform antibiotic stewardship decisions, mainly by 
reducing antibiotic initiation in low-risk patients (i.e., bron-
chitis, upper respiratory infection) and by early stoppage of 
antibiotics in patients with pneumonia and sepsis (10, 32, 
36). A recent 1,500 patient multicenter, ICU trial from the 
Netherlands which included more than 1,500 patients with 
suspected or confirmed infection found a significant reduc-
tion in antibiotic use and a mortality in the group that fol-
lowed a PCT-based antibiotic stewardship algorithm (37, 38). 
Our observation that a drop in PCT of at least 80% was associ-
ated with survival outcomes further supports the approach of 
monitoring PCT levels over time. Interestingly, our secondary 
analysis identified that simply assessing whether PCT decreases 
or increases from baseline to day 1 revealed a three-fold higher 
mortality in patients with a short-term increase in PCT levels. 
This simple finding could prove particularly useful during early 
critical care management. However, while PCT may contribute 
to prognosis, it is not able to identify nonsurvivors such that 
one would, for example, withdraw care if the PCT level does not 
decrease by more than 80%. Still, beyond antibiotic deescala-
tion in patients with clinical improvement and decreasing PCT 
levels, it remains unclear which therapeutic and/or diagnostic 
measures should be used in patients with nondecreasing PCT 
levels to improve outcomes (39, 40). One large critical care trial 
investigating whether PCT-guided initiation and escalation of 
antimicrobial therapy would improve survival did not find any 
outcomes benefit for this strategy (13). However, further inter-
ventional studies are needed to investigate whether monitoring 
of PCT kinetics over longer time periods will improve outcomes 
in patients with sepsis. Such a study should also investigate costs 
of PCT measurement and possible costs savings. Based on a lit-
erature review, a previous study has estimated of the total cost 
of performing a PCT assay, including assay material, reagents, 
technician time, purchase, maintenance of a bench top analyzer, 
and overhead, to be approximately Can$49.42 (approximately 
$50 USD) per test (41).
Strengths and Limitations
The strengths of this study are the rigorous study design with a 
large sample size, prospective inclusion of patients being treated 
for sepsis in different experienced centers across the United 
States, and the relatively low number of patients who were lost 
to follow-up. The study hypothesis was defined a priori, based 
on retrospective data (5), which strengthens our conclusions 
and provides external validation. As a limitation, we were not 
able to use patients who died or were discharged prior to the day 
4 blood draw in our main analysis and the prognostic accuracy 
in these patients is not clearly defined. Also, as an observational 
study, we cannot make conclusions about clinical effects of 
using a PCT algorithm for patient care. An interventional study 
is needed to test the hypothesis that serial monitoring of PCT 
will improve clinical decisions and outcomes (10, 40).
CONCLUSIONS
The results of this large, U.S.-based prospective multicenter 
study in several U.S. hospitals indicate that inability to decrease 
PCT by at least 80% is a significant independent predictor of 
mortality and may aid in sepsis care.
