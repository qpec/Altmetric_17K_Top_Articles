Abstract
Information encoding by means of persistent changes in synaptic strength supports long-term information storage and
memory in structures such as the hippocampus. In the piriform cortex (PC), that engages in the processing of associative
memory, only short-term synaptic plasticity has been described to date, both in vitro and in anesthetized rodents in vivo.
Whether the PC maintains changes in synaptic strength for longer periods of time is unknown: Such a property would
indicate that it can serve as a repository for long-term memories. Here, we report that in freely behaving animals,
frequency-dependent synaptic plasticity does not occur in the anterior PC (aPC) following patterned stimulation of the
olfactory bulb (OB). Naris closure changed action potential properties of aPC neurons and enabled expression of long-term
potentiation (LTP) by OB stimulation, indicating that an intrinsic ability to express synaptic plasticity is present. Odor
discrimination and categorization in the aPC is supported by descending inputs from the orbitofrontal cortex (OFC). Here,
OFC stimulation resulted in LTP (>4 h), suggesting that this structure plays an important role in promoting information
encoding through synaptic plasticity in the aPC. These persistent changes in synaptic strength are likely to comprise a
means through which long-term memories are encoded and/or retained in the PC.
Key words: long-term potentiation, naris closure, olfactory bulb, olfactory cortex, orbitofrontal cortex
Introduction
Synaptic plasticity is a cellular process, involving information
storage, that is likely to enable memory of different durations.
Persistent forms of synaptic plasticity, in the forms of long-
term potentiation (LTP) and long-term depression (LTD), are
expressed in memory processing structures such as the hippo-
campus (Bliss and Lomo 1973; Dudek and Bear 1992; Manahan-
Vaughan 1997), as well as in structures involved in sensory
information processing, such as the visual cortex (Tsanov and
Manahan-Vaughan, 2007a, 2007b).
At the level of the primary visual cortex, synaptic plasticity
is expressed in conjunction with the active processing of visual
information by adult rodents (Tsanov and Manahan-Vaughan
2007a, 2007b). This preprocessing of visual information by the

 visual cortex changes excitability levels in the hippocampus
(Tsanov and Manahan-Vaughan 2009) and may thus, support
hippocampal encoding of this sensory modality into a more
complex representation. It is, as yet, unclear whether other pri-
mary sensory cortices share this property. Storage of perceptual
information at the level of the primary sensory cortices is very
likely, however. For example, in the somatosensory cortex, tac-
tile stimulation leads to reorganization processes in humans
that are believed to depend on the induction of synaptic plas-
ticity (Hoffken et al. 2007). Furthermore, transcranial magnetic
stimulation, which emulates synaptic plasticity-inducing pro-
tocols, also triggers cortical plasticity (Tegenthoff et al. 2005;
Ragert et al. 2008).
More than 40 years ago, the pioneering computational neu-
roscientist, David Marr proposed that on the basis of their ana-
tomical circuitry, the hippocampus, cerebellum, and piriform
cortex (PC) are all ideally suited for the encoding and long-term
retention of experiences (Marr 1971). Whereas, a multitude of
studies have described long-term synaptic plasticity in vivo in
both the hippocampus and cerebellum, very few studies have
indicated that the PC exhibits long-lasting forms of plasticity.
Nonetheless, the primary olfactory (piriform) cortex is likely to
engage in the encoding of associative experiences. It has been
proposed to engage in pattern separation and completion
(Marr 1971; Haberly 2001), as well as in perceptual learning
(Barnes et al. 2008; Chapuis and Wilson 2011; Shakhawat et al.
2014). The PC also engages in odor discrimination and odor rule
learning (Roman et al. 1987; Chaillan et al. 1996; Saar et al. 1998;
Cohen et al. 2008, 2015) indicating that it not only preprocesses
olfactory information, but that it may also store information of
this kind. However, although short-term changes in synaptic
weights have been reported in the ascending pathway from the
olfactory bulb (OB) to the PC in vitro and in anesthetized ani-
mals (Kanter and Haberly 1990; Poo and Isaacson 2007; Cohen
et al. 2008), little is known as to whether more persistent (>4 h)
forms of synaptic plasticity are expressed that could in turn
support long-term information storage in the PC. In addition, it
has been reported that one specific high-frequency simulation
(HFS) protocol has no effect on synaptic strength in the anterior
PC (aPC) in vivo (Stripling et al. 1988, 1991). A key question in
this regard is the source of instruction: Can patterned stimula-
tion of the OB as the primary ascending input to the PC result
in long-term synaptic plasticity, or is the contribution of top–
down inputs from higher order structures required? In vitro
studies suggest that associational fiber inputs may facilitate
the induction of synaptic plasticity (Jung et al. 1990; Kanter and
Haberly 1990). Here, in freely behaving adult rats, we compared
the extent to which OB stimulation can result in synaptic plas-
ticity in the aPC with changes elicited by orbitofrontal cortex
(OFC) stimulation. We focused on the OFC because it is strongly
interconnected with the olfactory cortex and is involved in
odor discrimination and categorization (Illig 2005; Stalnaker
et al. 2014; Cohen et al. 2015).
We tested a broad spectrum of stimulation protocols that
are known to elicit synaptic plasticity of differing magnitudes,
forms, and durations in the hippocampus in vivo. We report
that under normal behavioral conditions, patterned stimulation
of the OB does not induce synaptic plasticity in the aPC.
Prolonged naris closure served to change action potential firing
properties, without altering the expression of N-methyl-D-
aspartate receptor (NMDAR) subunits and demonstrated that
under these circumstances synaptic plasticity could be induced
by OB stimulation. Strikingly, patterned stimulation of the OFC
resulted in LTP of the aPC, suggesting that the OFC may control
synaptic weights in this structure. Thus, we show on the one
hand that the OFC plays a decisive role in the determination as
to whether information is stored for longer periods in aPC syn-
apses. On the other hand, we demonstrate that long-term syn-
aptic information storage occurs in the PC, indicating that it
may serve as a repository for olfactory memories.
Materials and Methods
Subjects
The present study was carried out in accordance with the
European Communities Council Directive of 22 September
2010 (2010/63/EU) for care of laboratory animals. All experi-
ments were performed according to the guidelines of the
German Animal Protection Law and were approved by
the North Rhine-Westphalia State Authority (Bezirksamt,
Arnsberg). All efforts were made to reduce the number of
animals used. Male Wistar rats were housed individually
and maintained on a 12 h light/12 h dark cycle. They had ad
libitum access to water and food.
Surgery
Male Wistar rats (7–8 weeks old, Charles River, Sulzfeld, Germany)
underwent chronic implantation of a monopolar recording and
bipolar stimulation electrode (diameter: 0.1 mm, polyurethane-
coated stainless steel wire, Biomedical Instruments, Zöllnitz,
Germany). For examination of the ascending pathway to the PC, a
stimulation electrode was implanted into the OB and a recording
electrode was implanted into the dendritic layer I of the aPC (see
Supplementary Fig. 1A,C). To investigate the monosynaptic com-
ponent of the evoked response, the field potential component that
appeared immediately after the stimulus artifact was analyzed.
Coordinates for stimulation electrode: 7.9 mm anterior to bregma
(AP), 1.1–1.3 mm lateral (LAT) from midline, and 1.6–2.0 mm ven-
tral from pial surface (DV), for recording electrode: 3.2–3.7 mm AP,
3.0–3.3 mm LAT, and 5.5–7.0 mm DV based on coordinates
described by Cohen et al. (2008).
In another cohort of animals, the descending pathway from
the OFC was examined (see Supplementary Fig. 1B). A stimula-
tion electrode was implanted into the OFC (3.0 mm AP, 2.0 mm
LAT, and 3.8–4.2 mm DV) and a recording electrode was posi-
tioned in layer II of the aPC (3.2 mm AP, 3.3 mm LAT, and
5.4–6.0 mm DV) at a position where the evoked potential shows
a negative deflection immediately after the stimulus artifact,
reflecting the monosynaptic connection between OFC and aPC.
The coordinates were based on those used by Cohen et al.
(2008).
The electrode assembly was sealed and fixed to the skull
with dental acrylic (Paladur®, Heraeus Kulzer GmbH, Hanau,
Germany). Pre- and postsurgery analgesia was implemented
using Meloxicam (Metacam®, Boehringer Ingelheim Vetmedica
GmbH, Ingelheim/Rhein, Germany).
Seven to ten days after surgery recordings of field excitatory
postsynaptic potentials (fEPSPs) were obtained in the aPC by
stimulating the OB, or the OFC. Throughout experiments, ani-
mals could move freely within the recording chamber (40 cm ×
40 cm × 50 cm), as the implanted electrodes were connected via
a flexible cable and a swivel connector to the stimulation unit
(World Precision Instruments, Sarasota, FL, USA) and amplifier
(A-M Systems, Sequim, WA, USA). Aside from the insertion of
the connector cable at the start of the experiment, disturbance
of the animals was kept to an absolute minimum.

 Measurement of Evoked Potentials
fEPSPs in the aPC were generated by stimulating the OB or the
OFC at a low frequency (0.017 Hz) with single biphasic square
wave pulses of 0.2 ms duration per half wave. For each time-
point measured during the experiments, 5 recordings of evoked
responses recorded every 60 s were averaged. The first 6 time-
points recorded at 5 min intervals were used as a baseline refer-
ence and subsequently obtained data points were calculated as
a percentage of the mean of these 6 time-points. The fEPSP was
measured as the maximum slope from the onset of the fEPSP
to the trough of the first negative deflection of the evoked
response. By means of an input/output curve determination
(evaluation of 9 stimulation intensities from 100 μA to 900 μA in
100 μA steps), the maximum fEPSP response was identified, and
for the subsequent experiment a stimulus intensity that pro-
duced 40–50% of this maximum was used to evoke fEPSP
responses. After 60 min of recording, the period between samples
of evoked potentials was extended to 15 min. Patterned stimula-
tion of the OB or OFC was applied after 30 min of test-pulse
recordings to investigate if persistent synaptic plasticity can be
induced. Evoked responses were followed for 4 h after application
of patterned afferent stimulation. Twenty-four hours later a fur-
ther 1 h recording was conducted. Only animals that exhibited
stable test-pulse stimulation responses for 4.5 h and the 1 h on
the following day were used for experiments with application of
patterned stimulation. In experiments where patterned afferent
stimulation failed to induce synaptic plasticity recordings were
stopped 4 h after application of the stimulation protocol.
The
following
stimulation
protocols
were
used:
Low-
frequency stimulation (LFS) at 0.5 Hz, 1 Hz, 2 Hz, and 3 Hz were
applied as 900 consecutive pulses at a stimulation intensity of
40–50% or 70% of the maximum evoked response during the
input/output curve. Stimulations at 15 Hz, 25 Hz, and 50 Hz
were applied as 400 consecutive pulses. HFS at 100 Hz was
applied as 4 bursts of each 100 pulses with an interburst inter-
val of 5 min. HFS at 200 Hz and 400 Hz was applied as 10 bursts
of 15 pulses at either 200 Hz or 400 Hz, with an interburst inter-
val of 10 s. Theta-burst stimulation (TBS) was applied as 3
trains with an interval of 1 min and each train consisted of 10
bursts with each 10 pulses at 100 Hz with an interburst interval
of 200 ms (Cohen et al. 2008). A second TBS protocol consisted
of 2 trains of each 5 bursts with a 30 s intertrain interval and an
interburst interval of 200 ms. The 4 pulses of each burst were
applied at 100 Hz (Staubli and Scafidi 1999).
For the ascending pathway from the OB, all protocols were
tested to examine if the induction of persistent synaptic plas-
ticity depends on a specific frequency (Table 1).
Animals with naris plugs were tested once a week with pat-
terned afferent stimulation starting from 2 weeks after inser-
tion of the naris plug. Stimulation protocols were applied in the
following order: TBS with 3 trains, HFS at 100 Hz, LFS at 1 Hz
900 pulses at 70% intensity and 50 Hz.
To examine the descending pathway from the OFC, specific
protocols were chosen: LFS at 1 Hz 900 pulses at 70% intensity,
and HFS at 100 Hz and 200 Hz.
The
intracortical
electroencephalogram
was
monitored
throughout in vivo experiments. None of the protocols used eli-
cited epileptiform or seizure activity in the rats.
Postmortem Verification of Electrode Position
At the end of the study, brains were removed for histological
verification of electrode localization and stained in 0.1% cresyl
violet following the procedure that was described before
(Hansen and Manahan-Vaughan 2015). Photomicrographs (see
Supplementary Fig. 1) were taken with a digital video camera sys-
tem (Visitron Systems, Puchheim, Germany) on a microscope
(Leica Mikrosysteme Vertrieb GmbH). Animals with incorrectly
implanted electrodes were excluded from further analysis.
Sensory Deprivation
Animals for electrophysiological experiments with sensory
deprivation were implanted with chronic electrodes in the OB
and aPC as described above. They were tested for stable test-
pulse stimulation responses and animals exhibiting unstable
recordings of test-pulse stimulation were excluded. Naris plugs
were prepared as reported by Cummings et al. (1997). One naris
plug, made of silicone tubing (diameter 2.5 mm, Carl Roth
GmbH + Co. KG, Karlsruhe, Germany), surgical silk (metric 4),
and filaments of unwaxed dental floss, was inserted under
anesthesia
(Nembutal,
52 mg/kg,
i.p.)
and
analgesia
(Meloxicam, 0.2 mg/kg, s.c.). In one cohort (N = 10), a naris plug
was inserted into the nostril ipsilateral to the electrode posi-
tion. A second cohort (N = 8), that underwent insertion of a
naris plug into the nostril contralateral to the electrode posi-
tion, served as a control. During the period after naris plug
insertion, weight, appearance, behavior, and well-being of the
animals were regularly checked. Two weeks after naris plug
insertion, electrophysiological experiments using patterned
afferent stimulation of the OB were commenced. At the end of
in vivo electrophysiological recordings, animals were used for
in vitro patch clamp recordings.
To examine the effect of sensory deprivation on protein
expression in the aPC and OB, an additional cohort of male
Wistar rats (12 weeks) underwent naris plug insertion into the
right nostril (ipsilateral to aPC recordings). The plug was left in
place for 3 weeks. The contralateral hemisphere served as a
control.
Patch Clamp Recordings

with isoflurane, decapitated and the brain was extracted

 rapidly in ice cold, and oxygenated sucrose cutting solution (in
mM: 87 NaCl, 2.5 KCl, 0.5 CaCl2, 7 MgCl2, 1.25 NaH2PO4xH20,
2
D-glucose, 75 sucrose, 25 NaHCO3). Coronal brain slices
(350 μm thick) containing the aPC were cut using a vibratome
(VT1000S,
Leica
Biosystems
Nussloch
GmbH,
Nussloch,
Germany) and slices were transferred into tempered (35°C),
oxygenated
sucrose
cutting
solution
and
incubated
for
30 min.
For patch clamp recordings, slices were transferred into a
recording chamber positioned on the fixed stage of a micro-
scope (BX51WI, OLYMPUS EUROPA SE & CO. KG, Hamburg,
Germany). Using infrared light, cell bodies of neurons in layer
2/3 of the aPC were visually identified and subsequently used
for whole-cell patch clamp recordings. Borosilicate glass record-
ing pipettes were filled with an intracellular solution (in mM: 97.5
potassium gluconate, 32.5 KCl, 5 EGTA, 10 HEPES, 1 MgCl2, 4
Na2ATP, pH 7.3, 290 mOsm). Recordings were performed in a
current-clamp mode using an amplifier (EPC10 USB, HEKA
Electronic Dr. Schulze GmbH, Lambrecht/Pfalz, Germany) and
raw data were digitized at 10 kHz. PATCHMASTER acquisition
software and AP feature software (MATLAB code developed in
Department of Psychology, University of Connecticut, by Prof. M.
Volgushev) were used to analyze intrinsic properties of the mem-
brane. The resting potential was determined from the mean of
10 s baseline recording. The input resistance was calculated from
the slope of the linear fit of the relationship between the change
in membrane potential (ΔV) and the amplitude of the applied
current (duration: 600 ms, between −40 pA and +20 pA). The
current necessary to evoke an action potential from the rest-
ing potential was determined as threshold current. The onset
of the action potential was defined by a minimum rate of rise
(set as 20 V/s). The time required to reach the half-width point
of the action potential was measured from the onset of the
action potential. The firing frequency properties were exam-
ined by applying square current pulses (duration 1 s) from
0 pA to 400 pA in steps of 50 pA and the firing frequency was
analyzed as the number of spikes elicited during the applica-
tion of each current step. Patched cells were filled with biocy-
tin (1 mg/ml, Sigma-Aldrich, St. Louis, USA) and detected by
streptavidin Cy3 (1:1000, Dianova, Hamburg, Germany). The
neuronal marker NeuN (1:100, clone A60, Merck Millipore,
Darmstadt, Deutschland) detected by goat anti-mouse Cy2
(1:250, Dianova) was used to differentiate between neurons
and interneurons (Fig. 3F). All cells were divided into pyrami-
dal cells, semilunar cells, and interneurons depending on
patch clamp recordings and morphological properties (Haberly
1983; Suzuki and Bekkers 2007, 2011). Only pyramidal cells
were used for further analysis.
Immunohistochemistry
A cohort of 5 animals with a unilateral naris plug was deeply
anesthetized with Nembutal (52 mg/kg, i.p.) and perfused trans-
cardially with cold Ringer’s solution containing heparin (0.2%,
Roche, Basel, Switzerland) followed by 4% paraformaldehyde
(PFA). The brains were stored in 4% PFA for 24 h followed by
cryoprotection in 30% sucrose at 4°C for several days. The ipsi-
lateral and contralateral hemispheres of each brain were sepa-
rated and serial coronal section (30 μm) containing the aPC was
prepared on a freezing microtome.
Immunohistochemistry was performed on free-floating
sections as previously described (Yousef et al. 2004; Gruter
et al. 2015). Briefly, after H2O2 pretreatment and blocking in
PBS-Tx containing avidin (Avidin–biotin blocking kit, Vector
Laboratories, Burlingame, CA, USA), sections were incubated
with goat polyclonal anti-NMDAε2 primary antibody (1:200,
sc-1469, Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Dallas, TX, USA) in biotin
(Avidin–biotin blocking kit, Vector Laboratories), overnight at
room temperature (RT). Then, sections were incubated in bio-
tinylated horse anti-goat secondary antibody (1:500, # BA
9500,
Vector
Laboratories),
before
applying
avidin–biotin
complex (1:1000, # PK-6100, Vector Laboratories).
For the GluN2A receptor, the biotinylated tyramine method
(Adams 1992) was used. After pretreatment and blocking, sec-
tions were incubated for 5 days at 4°C in the primary antibody
solution containing rabbit polyclonal anti-NMDAε1 (1:250, #sc-
9056, Santa Cruz Biotechnology). Then sections were incubated
with biotinylated goat anti-rabbit secondary antibody (1:500,
#BA-1000, Vector Laboratories). Avidin–biotin complex (1:1000)
was applied, before and after incubation in the amplification
solution with 1% biotinylated tyramine.
Staining was visualized by a 0.05% 3,3’-diaminobenzidine
solution (DAB, Sigma-Aldrich). Finally, sections were mounted
onto 4% potassium chrome alum-gelatin slides, dehydrated
and cover-slipped with DePeX. Images of stained sections were
acquired with a digital camera (MBF Europe B.V., Delft, the
Netherlands) on a light microscope with Neurolucida software
(MBF Europe B.V.) at a magnification of 2.5×.
Routine scrutinization of the PC using a light microscope,
during immunohistochemical assessments, revealed no evi-
dence of apoptosis as a result of naris closure (not shown).
Western Blotting
For western blotting analysis, a cohort of 10 animals with naris
plugs was anesthetized with isoflurane, decapitated and brains
were dissected. From each animal, the ipsilateral and contralat-
eral aPC and OB were dissected and separately frozen.
Western blotting was performed as previously described
(Gruter et al. 2015; Novkovic et al. 2015). Briefly, the tissue was
homogenized and centrifuged (20 800 g, Eppendorf Centrifuge
5417R). Pellet and supernatant were diluted in Tris-HCl buffer
containing
protease
inhibitor
(Roche).
The
total
protein
concentration for each sample was determined using the
Bradford protein assay (Ultrospec 3000, Pharmacia Biotech,
Piscataway, NJ, USA). Protein samples (at least 10 μg protein
per sample) were separated in sodium dodecyl sulfate (SDS)
polyacrylamide gels. Electrophoresis was performed for ca.
1.5 h at 400 V and 15 mA. Then gels and polyvinyl difluoride
membranes were placed into the transfer chamber (400 V,
300 mA, and 30 min). Membranes were blocked (0.1% Tween
20 in TBS with 5% nonfat dry milk) and afterwards, incubated
overnight at 4°C in SignalBoost solution (Calbiochem) containing
the primary antibody: rabbit polyclonal anti-tyrosine hydroxylase
(1:2000, # AB152, Merck Millipore), rabbit polyclonal anti-GluN2A
(1:1000, # 07-632, Merck Millipore), or rabbit polyclonal anti-
GluN2B (1:1000, # 06–600, Merck Millipore). As a loading control,
mouse monoclonal anti-β-actin (1:5000–1:50 000, # A2228, Sigma-
Aldrich) was labeled. Then membranes were incubated with the
secondary antibodies: anti-mouse or anti-rabbit horseradish per-
oxidase linked IgG (1:20 000, # NA931V, # NA924V, GE Healthcare).
For every target protein, 2–4 gels (in a randomized order of sam-
ples) were performed. Protein bands were visualized using
an enhanced chemiluminescence reagent (1:1, #RPN2232V1,
#RPN2232V2, GE Healthcare) with CCD camera (Fusion Solo S,
Vilber Lourmat) using VisionCapt software (v16.12, Vilber
Lourmat).

 In Situ Hybridization
Animals that were used for subsequent analysis of Arc mRNA
expression in the aPC were implanted with a stimulation elec-
trode in the OFC and a recording electrode in the aPC, as
described above. On the day of experiment, animals were habit-
uated to the recording box for ca. 1 h before they were stimu-
lated in the OFC with one burst of 100 pulses 100 Hz at a
stimulation intensity of 400 μA. Five minutes after HFS, animals
were sacrificed, brains were removed, shock-frozen in isopen-
tane at −80°C on dry ice and stored at −80°C until sectioning into
20 μm thick coronal slices on a Cryostat (Leica CM3050S).
Sections included the aPC and OFC (ca. +5.0 – 2.0 mm from
Bregma), were mounted directly on glass slides and stored at
−80°C. Sections of animals with incorrect electrode placement in
the OFC were excluded from further analysis.
Compartment analysis of temporal activity by fluorescence in
situ hybridization was conducted using a modified procedure used
by Guzowski and Worley (2001) as described previously by our lab
(Gruter et al. 2015). Arc cDNA plasmids (Entelechon GmbH, Bad
Abbach, Germany) with the sequence of Lyford et al. (1995) were
linearized and the antisense RNA probe labeled with digoxigenin
was created (Ambion MaxiScript Kit, Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA,
USA). Yield and integrity were verified by gel electrophoresis.
Per animal, one glass slide (with at least 3 sections contain-
ing the aPC) was left at RT for 1 h. Slides were fixed in 4% PFA,
washed in 2× saline-sodium citrate buffer (SSC) and placed in
acetic anhydride solution. After washing in 2× SSC they were
left in 2× SSC. Slides were placed in a humid chamber (1:1, 2×
SSC, and 50% deionized formamide solution) and prehybridiza-
tion buffer (Sigma-Aldrich) was added. Digoxigenin-labeled
DNA probes (1 ng/μl) in hybridization buffer (Sigma-Aldrich)
were applied on the slides and hybridization in a humid cham-
ber at 56°C lasted ca. 17 h. Then, slides were placed in 56°C 2×
SSC (3 × 5 min, each) and afterwards in 2× SSC containing
RNase (1 μg/ml, Sigma-Aldrich). Before final rinsing in TBS (3 ×
5 min, each), they were placed for 10 min at 37°C in 2× SSC,
10 min at 56°C in 0.5× SSC, 30 min at 56°C in 0.5× SSC, 10 min at
RT in 0.5× SSC, and 2 times for 5 min at RT in 1× SSC.
For signal detection, slices were pretreated with 3% H2O2 in
1× SSC for 15 min and incubated for 70 min in 0.2% TBS-Tween
20 containing 20% avidin (Avidin–biotin blocking kit, Vector
Laboratories)
and
1%
bovine
serum-albumin
(BSA).
Arc-
digoxigenin was detected by anti-digoxigenin-POD Fab frag-
ment (1:400, #11 207 733 910, Roche) in TBS-Tween containing
1% BSA and 20% biotin (Avidin–biotin blocking kit, Vector
Laboratories) for 90 min. Signal was enhanced using biotiny-
lated tyramine (Adams 1992) in TBS for 20 min. The Arc signal
was visualized by streptavidin Cy5 (1:2000, Dianova) and nuclei
by 4′,6-diamidino-2-phenylindole (1:10 000, DAPI, Invitrogen) in
1% BSA TBS-Tween for 90 min. After rinsing and air drying,
slides were mounted (SCR-38447, Dianova).
Arc mRNA expression within the nuclei of neurons in lower
layer 2 of the aPC was examined. Therefore, z-stacks were
obtained using a Zeiss Apotome at 63× magnification. For each
animal, z-stacks of both hemispheres of 3 sections were
obtained. The hemisphere contralateral to the electrode place-
ment was used as control. Z-stacks were chosen to contain rep-
resentative regions of aPC lower layer 2.
Data Analysis and Statistics
Statistical analysis was conducted using Statistica software
(Version 12, StatSoft. Inc., USA).
Electrophysiology in Freely Behaving Animals
All fEPSP responses recorded during in vivo electrophysiological
experiments were expressed as a mean percentage ± standard
error of the mean (SEM) of the average baseline value and visu-
alized using GraphPad Prism software (GraphPad Software Inc.,
USA). To analyze differences in responses to patterned afferent
stimulation, between groups, an analysis of variance (ANOVA)
with repeated measures was conducted. For every stimulation
protocol, the effect of patterned stimulation was compared with
test-pulse stimulation (Figs 1A,B and 4A–C and Table 1). For
experiments with naris plug animals, the effect of each stimula-
tion protocol was compared between the 2 cohorts (Fig. 2A–D).
Patch Clamp
For statistical comparisons of neuronal characteristics (e.g.,
resting membrane potential) between both (open and closed
naris) groups, unpaired Student’s t-tests were used (Fig. 3D; see
Supplementary Fig. 4). For comparison of firing frequency prop-
erties of action potentials, ANOVA with repeated measures was
performed (Fig. 3G).
Immunohistochemistry
The optical density of immunohistochemically stained sections
was calculated using the “Color deconvolution” plugin (Ruifrok
et al. 2003) and conversion from red, green, blue (RGB) to 8-bit
format in ImageJ (1.51d, Wayne Rasband, National Institutes of
Health, USA). For each section, the background staining was
subtracted from the regions of interest (lower layer 1 of aPC),
using the anterior part of the anterior commissure. To scale the
independent plates and staining sessions, a generalized residual
sum of squares algorithm in R software was used (Kreutz et al.
2007). Statistical analysis was performed to compare protein
levels the ipsilateral (closed) with the contralateral (open) side
using paired Student’s t-tests in Statistica software (Fig. 3A,B; see
Supplementary Fig. 3). Results were expressed as signal intensity
(a.u.) ± SEM and visualized using GraphPad.
Western Blotting
For quantification of western blotting, the volume of the pro-
tein band and the corresponding actin band were determined
for each sample using VisionCapt software. Blots with missing
or blurred actin bands were excluded from the analysis. For
each sample of each blot, the ratio of the volume of the protein
to the volume of actin was calculated. After scaling in R soft-
ware (residual sum of squares algorithm), the results were visu-
alized as signal intensity (a.u.) ± SEM using GraphPad and
statistical analysis (paired t-test) was performed in Statistica
software (Fig. 2E, see Supplementary Fig. 2).
In Situ Hybridization
To examine Arc mRNA expression after HFS in the OFC, com-
plete nuclei were marked in each z-stack using ImageJ software
and nuclei were checked for Arc mRNA expression. The per-
centage of Arc mRNA positive neurons of all neurons was
counted for each z-stack during an experimenter- blind analy-
sis. For each animal, the mean of 3 z-stacks taken per ipsilat-
eral and contralateral hemisphere was calculated. Results were
visualized using GraphPad and unpaired t-test was performed
to examine differences between hemispheres (Fig. 4E).
N corresponds to the number of animals and n to the num-
ber of neurons. The level of significance was set to P < 0.05.

 Results
Patterned Stimulation of the OB of Freely Behaving Rats
Fails to Elicit Synaptic Plasticity in the aPC
Adult male rats (7–8 weeks old) underwent implantation of a
stimulating electrode in the OB and a recording electrode in the
aPC, to enable subsequent recordings of evoked responses from
freely behaving animals (see Supplementary Fig. 1). We first
applied LFS at 1 Hz in the OB, a frequency that elicits robust LTD
in the hippocampus (Manahan-Vaughan 1997). This protocol
failed to result in any changes in synaptic strength in the aPC,
however (test-pulse stimulation versus 1 Hz LFS: F1,42 = 0.55, P =
0.463, N = 22, ANOVA, Fig. 1A). HFS at 100 Hz, that elicits robust
LTP in the hippocampus (Manahan-Vaughan 1997), also failed to
elicit changes in synaptic strength (test-pulse stimulation versus
100 Hz HFS: F1,40 = 0.6, P = 0.441, N = 21, ANOVA, Fig. 1B). To clar-
ify if this absence of effect was specifically related to the stimu-
lation frequencies or protocols used, we examined the effects of
OB stimulation at frequencies ranging between 0.5 Hz and
400 Hz, as well as using theta-burst stimulation (TBS). None of
these protocols resulted in synaptic plasticity (Table 1).
Naris Closure Reveals Frequency-Dependent Synaptic
Plasticity in the aPC
Given reports in the literature that the aPC expresses synaptic
plasticity in vitro (Jung et al. 1990; Kanter and Haberly 1990;
Franks and Isaacson 2005; Poo and Isaacson 2007), we won-
dered whether the absence of effects in the freely behaving rat
reflected a resistance, rather than an inability, to express plas-
ticity under the conditions tested. Postnatal olfactory depriva-
tion results in enhanced synaptic potentiation in the aPC
(Franks and Isaacson 2005). We therefore assessed whether
naris closure (Cummings et al. 1997) changes the insensitivity
of the aPC to patterned stimulation of the OB. Following 2
weeks of unilateral naris closure, TBS of the OB resulted in LTP

 that lasted for more than 4 h in the aPC. This effect was only
apparent ipsilaterally (N = 10) to naris closure when com-
pared with naris closure on the contralateral side (N = 8) (F1,16
= 13.604, P < 0.01, ANOVA, Fig. 2A). HFS at 100 Hz resulted in a
tendency toward an increase of evoked potential magnitude
in the aPC ipsilaterally, compared with responses evoked
contralaterally to naris closure (F1,16 = 4.029, P = 0.062,
ANOVA, Fig. 2B). Here, responses were significantly greater
after HFS compared with test-pulse stimulated controls (F1,18
= 11.232, P < 0.01, N = 10, ANOVA, not shown). By contrast,
stimulation at 1 Hz or 50 Hz (ipsilateral: N = 9, contralateral: N
= 8) failed to elicit changes in synaptic strength in the aPC
(1 Hz: F1,16 = 0.001, P = 0.974, 50 Hz: F1,15 = 0.15, P = 0.706,
ANOVA, Fig. 2C,D). A reduction in tyrosine hydroxylase in the
ipsilateral OB compared with the OB that was contralateral to
naris closure (t(9) = 7.102, P < 0.0001, N = 10, t-test, Fig. 2E–G)
confirmed that reliable unilateral sensory deprivation had
occurred (Baker et al. 1993; Brunjes 1994).
To clarify whether naris closure impacted upon plasticity-
related proteins, we assessed whether the expression of sub-
units of the NMDAR was affected by naris closure, as changes
in GluN2B mRNA have been reported in young adult mice after
different types of unilateral olfactory deprivation (Kim et al.
2006). However, no changes in the expression of the GluN2A
or GluN2B subunits of the NMDAR were evident in the aPC
after naris closure (Fig. 3 and Supplementary Figs 2 and 3).
Western blot analysis revealed no change in subunit protein
levels (GluN2A: t(4) = 0.385, P = 0.72, GluN2B: t(4) = −0.204, P =
0.848, N = 5 each, t-test, see Supplementary Fig. 2). Similarly,
NMDAR subunit expression was equivalent in layer 1 of the
aPC that was ipsilateral (“closed”) or contralateral (“open”) to
naris closure (GluN2A: t(4) = −0.421, P = 0.695, GluN2B: t(4) =
0.916, P = 0.412, N = 5 each, t-test, Fig. 3A–C). Layer 2, that
others have reported as exhibiting changes in GluN2B mRNA
after olfactory deprivation in “mice” (Kim et al. 2006), also
exhibited no differences (GluN2B: t(9) = −0.84, P = 0.448, N = 5
each,
t-test, see
Supplementary
Fig.
3).
Although
passive
membrane properties of aPC neurons remained unchanged
(see Supplementary Fig. 4), we detected changes in firing prop-
erties of pyramidal cells of the aPC (Fig. 3D–H) when cells that
were ipsilateral (N = 11, n = 18) or contralateral (N = 11, n = 14)
to
naris
closure
were
compared.
Here,
in
particular,
an
increase in the duration of the action potential was evident in
terms of the half-width of the potential (t(30) = 2.543, P < 0.05, t-
test, Fig. 3D). The firing frequency remained unchanged between
hemispheres (F1,30 = 0.014 P = 0.91, ANOVA, Fig. 3G,H). These
findings suggest that reorganization at the level of the NMDAR
does not occur, but naris closure may change neuronal sensitiv-
ity to depolarization.
The OFC Supports the Induction of Synaptic Plasticity in
the aPC
Our observation, that the PC resists expressing synaptic plastic-
ity following OB stimulation, while retaining an intrinsic ability
to express LTP after olfactory sensory deprivation provoked the
question as to the circumstances under which the aPC might
express synaptic plasticity in the absence of a manipulation
such as naris closure. The OFC is involved in odor categoriza-
tion and is strongly interconnected to the olfactory cortex,
including the PC (Illig 2005; Stalnaker et al. 2014). Thus, we
explored whether patterned stimulation of the OFC might
induce synaptic plasticity in the aPC.
We observed that HFS of the OFC at 100 Hz resulted in LTP
in the aPC compared with nonstimulated rats (F1,12 = 26.649,
P < 0.001, N = 7, Fig. 4A), whereas LFS at 1 Hz did not change
synaptic strength (F1,12 = 3.426, P = 0.089, N = 7, ANOVA, Fig. 4B).
Increasing the stimulation intensity to 200 Hz did not result in
an improvement of LTP (F1,14 = 0.582, P = 0.458, N = 8, ANOVA,
Fig. 4C) suggesting that the regulation of LTP in the aPC by the
OFC is constrained to a narrow frequency range. Examination of
Arc mRNA expression in the aPC, as a marker for activity-
dependent neuronal activity (Guzowski et al. 1999), revealed an
increase in Arc mRNA expression in the aPC ipsilateral to HFS of
the OFC compared with the contralateral aPC (t(10) = 2.372, P <
0.05, N = 6 each, t-test, Fig. 4E–G). This supports that stimulation
of the OFC has a direct impact on neuronal activity in the aPC.

 Discussion
In this study, we explored whether persistent forms of synaptic
plasticity are expressed in the aPC following stimulation of
ascending or descending afferent pathways to this structure.
Strikingly, despite testing a broad range of frequencies to stim-
ulate the OB, we could not elicit either LTP or LTD in the aPC of
freely behaving adult rats under standard physiological and
behavioral conditions (Fig. 1 and Table 1). This does not reflect
an absence of an intrinsic ability of this structure to express
synaptic plasticity, however: Naris closure, that is known to
change aPC sensitivity (Best and Wilson 2003; Franks and
Isaacson 2005) facilitated the expression of LTP following OB
stimulation (Fig. 2). This raised the question as to which physi-
ological conditions could lead to synaptic plasticity in the aPC,
in the absence of naris closure. We observed that patterned
stimulation of the OFC, which is involved in odor perception
and categorization (Li et al. 2010; Stalnaker et al. 2014), resulted
in LTP (>4 h), but not LTD in the aPC (Fig. 4). We propose that it
is the top–down regulation by the OFC that provides an impor-
tant “impetus” to the PC for information encoding in the form
of synaptic plasticity. It also shows that the aPC is capable of
long-term maintenance of changes in synaptic strength.
This study is the first to examine whether persistent synap-
tic plasticity, that is typically elicited by afferent patterned
stimulation in a broad range of frequencies (in structures such
as the hippocampus), occurs in the ascending olfactory path-
way to the aPC in freely behaving rodents. In accordance with
in vivo studies that focused on attempts to induce LTP follow-
ing one application of one specific afferent frequency (Racine
et al. 1983; Stripling et al. 1988, 1991), none of the afferent stim-
ulation protocols were effective in generating any long-lasting
changes in synaptic weight in the monosynaptic response,
although the same protocols are highly effective in generating
synaptic plasticity that lasts for days in the hippocampus
in vivo (Manahan-Vaughan 1997, 1998, 2000). Nonetheless, syn-
aptic plasticity in the PC has been reported following activation
of the ascending fibers in studies performed in vitro (Jung et al.
1990; Kanter and Haberly 1990; Franks and Isaacson 2005; Poo
and Isaacson 2007) and in anesthetized animals (Cohen et al.
2008), but these effects were small and difficult to induce (Jung
et al. 1990; Kanter and Haberly 1990; Cohen et al. 2008).
Furthermore, in vitro effects seem to be linked to an early post-
natal period (Franks and Isaacson 2005; Poo and Isaacson 2007).
Altogether, our data obtained from adult behaving rats suggest
that information transfer from the ascending pathway alone is
not sufficient to promote long-term information encoding via
synaptic plasticity in the aPC.
It was quite striking that none of the large range of stimula-
tion protocols that we tested were effective in eliciting synaptic
plasticity in the aPC (Fig. 1 and Table 1), especially given the
importance of persistent synaptic plasticity for long-term infor-
mation storage in ostensibly comparable structures such as the
hippocampus
(Manahan-Vaughan
and
Braunewell
1999;
Whitlock et al. 2006; Nabavi et al. 2014). Furthermore, other pri-
mary sensory cortices, such as the visual cortex, express synap-
tic plasticity in conjunction with visual information processing
(Tsanov and Manahan-Vaughan 2007b, 2007a). One possibility
is that, despite the ostensibly similar input and “wiring” of the
hippocampus and PC (Marr 1971; Haberly 2001), the “hippocam-
pus-derived” afferent stimulation patterns in no way emulated
intrinsic patterns that can be expected to originate from the
OB. Notwithstanding this, stimulation patterns in the range of
breathing (1–3 Hz; Welker 1964; Walker et al. 1997) or sniffing-
related OB oscillations (TBS, 15 Hz, 25 Hz, 50 Hz; Chapman et al.
1998; Ravel et al. 2003; Kay et al. 2009) were also ineffective in
triggering synaptic plasticity. These discrepancies can possibly
be explained by the distinctive neuroanatomy of the olfactory
system compared with the other sensory systems. For example,
in contrast to other primary sensory cortices, sensory stimuli,
in the form of odor information, do not undergo initial thalamic
processing, with projections originating from the olfactory epi-
thelium, continuing from the OB to the paleocortical olfactory
cortex in a broadly distributed and nontopographic manner
(Illig and Haberly 2003; Sosulski et al. 2011). This contrasts with
the topographical manner in which visual, auditory, and
somatosensory information is processed: projecting from the
periphery via thalamic nuclei to neurons of the neocortical pri-
mary sensory cortices (Kaas 1997). The nontopographical pro-
jections of the olfactory system could mean, in turn, that the

the aPC. (A) HFS of the OFC (with 4 bursts of 100 Hz) induces LTP (>4 h) in the
aPC (N = 7). (B) LFS (1 Hz, N = 7), and (C) HFS (200 Hz, N = 8) do not alter synaptic
transmission. Representative fEPSPs are shown in (D) and in insets in (A) that

 populations of synapses that were activated by afferent stimu-
lation of the OB in our study possessed a degree of heterogene-
ity
that
precluded
them
from
expressing
monosynaptic
plasticity (Illig and Haberly 2003; Sosulski et al. 2011). Another
consideration is that a precise modulation of the intrinsic cir-
cuitry of the PC and the associated feedforward and feedback
inhibition within this circuitry (Suzuki and Bekkers 2012) is
required for sensory information processing at the level of syn-
aptic plasticity.
Although other in vivo studies in awake rodents also found
an absence of long-lasting synaptic plasticity after HFS in the
monosynaptic component of the evoked potential (Racine et al.
1983; Stripling et al. 1988, 1991), one of these studies reported
kindling induced plasticity after daily HFS in vivo (Racine et al.
1983). Kindling protocols are used to induce epilepsy in rodents
(Loscher 2002; Chauvette et al. 2016) and this procedure is
known to cause significant changes in the circuitry of the PC
(Loscher and Ebert 1996). The protocols we used in our study
were much milder than the kindling protocol used by the stud-
ies mentioned above, and at no time did we detect seizure
activity in our rats.
Given reports that synaptic plasticity can be induced in the
PC in vitro and in anesthetized rats (Jung et al. 1990; Kanter and
Haberly 1990; Franks and Isaacson 2005; Poo and Isaacson 2007;
Cohen et al. 2008), we wondered whether the success of these
studies related to a relative suppression of intrinsic excitability
that was related, in turn, to the absence of olfactory inputs (in
the cortical slice) and reduced excitatory tonus (in the anesthe-
tized rodent). Another possibility is that in adulthood the PC
loses a readiness for the expression of synaptic plasticity that
is
characteristic
of
neonatal
cortical
circuitry
(Crair
and
Malenka 1995; Kirkwood et al. 1995; Best and Wilson 2003;
Franks and Isaacson 2005; Poo and Isaacson 2007). A third con-
sideration is that sensory deprivation triggers increases in sen-
sitivity to sensory inputs and emulates neonatal plasticity
propensity
in sensory
structures
such
as
the
visual
and
somatosensory cortex (He et al. 2006; Chung et al. 2017).
This motivated us to examine whether synaptic plasticity
can be induced in the aPC after prolonged naris closure. We
found that under these circumstances the aPC expresses LTP in
response to TBS of the OB (Fig. 2). Similar effects have been dem-
onstrated in an in vitro study of early developmental plasticity
in the aPC, where an enhanced response of the aPC to weak TBS,
and reduced excitability upon stimulation of the ascending
fibers have been reported following naris closure in neonatal
rats (Best and Wilson 2003; Franks and Isaacson 2005). In addi-
tion, changes in morphology of the OB and aPC have been
reported after unilateral olfactory deprivation (Meisami 1976;
Cummings et al. 1997; Wilson et al. 2000), and changes in intra-
bulbar projections are triggered that are believed to restore the
OB projections to a state equivalent to that achieved in early
development (Marks et al. 2006; Cummings and Belluscio 2010).
Although permanent unilateral naris closure can result in
apoptosis of neurons in the OB and PC (Heimer and Kalil 1978;
Friedman and Price 1986; Frazier and Brunjes 1988; Leung and
Wilson 2003; Cummings and Belluscio 2010), in the present
study, temporary naris closure did not alter the gross anatomy
of the aPC. Others have reported that naris cautery in adult rats
triggers weak apoptosis in the PC that peaks at around 5 days
and returns to control levels 10–20 days after closure (Leung
and Wilson 2003). Our assessments took place at least 2 weeks
after temporary naris closure, and thus, we can assume that
apoptosis played a negligible role, if any, in the synaptic plas-
ticity effects we detected.
In the present study, manifestation of LTP in the aPC, in
response to OB stimulation after naris closure, was not associ-
ated with changes in NMDAR subunit expression (Fig. 3A,B; see
also Supplementary Figs 2 and 3), in contrast to reports from a
study that examined changes in GluN2B mRNA in the aPC of
“mice” under similar circumstances (Kim et al. 2006). This sug-
gests that changes on the mRNA level may not impact on the
protein level of these receptor subunits, or that the mouse
effects are species-specific. The absence of alterations in pas-
sive neuronal properties, such as the resting membrane poten-
tial found in our study (see Supplementary Fig. 4), suggests that
generalized changes in excitability did not occur. However, the
change in action potential width that we observed (Fig. 3D)
indicates that more specific alterations in the sensitivity of
neurons to afferent stimulation were triggered by naris closure.
The alterations induced by naris closure may include a change
in the sensitivity or expression of A-type K+ channels: Blocking
these channels promotes synaptic potentiation in the ascend-
ing fibers of the aPC in vitro (Johenning et al. 2009). A modifica-
tion of this kind would result in a more efficient transfer of
ascending olfactory information from distal apical dendrites to
aPC neurons, which under normal circumstances is not very
reliable (Bathellier et al. 2009). Finally, under condition of sen-
sory
deprivation,
the
induction
of
synaptic
plasticity
is
enhanced, whereas under normal circumstances the ascending
pathway does not enable the induction of synaptic plasticity.
Another consideration here is that through naris closure we
emulated a situation whereby no olfactory information was
processed by the recipient PC. Even in the absence of directed
sniffing, or confrontation with a specific odor, breathing can be
expected to provide an ongoing “stream” of olfactory informa-
tion, that in turn, may result in “background noise” against
which the PC must identify salient olfactory information that
should possibly be stored in the form of associative memory.
Naris closure will have served to remove this kind of back-
ground noise, thereby improving signal-to-noise ratios during
our attempts to induce LTP through OB stimulation. This inter-
pretation offers an explanation as to why synaptic plasticity
can be elicited in slice preparations of the PC (Jung et al. 1990;
Kanter and Haberly 1990; Franks and Isaacson 2005; Poo and
Isaacson 2007) and in anesthetized animals (Cohen et al. 2008):
In the former case, olfaction is completely absent, and in the
latter case, general anesthesia will have reduced global excit-
ability in the PC thus, provided a less noisy backdrop upon
which LTP-inducing protocols are likely to be more effective.
An absence of ability of lateral olfactory tract-aPC synapses
to “autonomously” trigger and/or express synaptic plasticity
may actually be advantageous to olfactory information proces-
sing. The physiology of the OB speaks against a role for this
structure in triggering synaptic plasticity: Rapid odor desensiti-
zation and adaptation processes occur at the sensor level
(Getchell and Shepherd 1978; Zufall and Leinders-Zufall 2000)
suggesting that action potential firing may not be sustained
long enough to trigger synaptic plasticity. Furthermore, it is
unclear how the OB would “know” that a particular odor is
salient enough to require encoding and storage in the PC.
Sniffing behavior induces strong oscillatory coupling between
OB and aPC and may thereby increase the probability of signal
transmission to the aPC (Litaudon et al. 2008). Beside triggering
changes in intrinsic oscillations in the olfactory system by
sniffing (Chapman et al. 1998; Martin et al. 2006), changes in
oscillatory activity are also triggered in associated structures
such as OFC and amygdala (Chapuis et al. 2009). These changes
in turn may make the aPC more receptive to the induction of

 synaptic plasticity. Finally, if the odor is behaviorally relevant,
higher order structures may then “instruct” retention of an
odor category/odor item by facilitating the induction of synap-
tic plasticity in this structure.
The question thus arises as to which circumstances can
generate enough input signal resolution such that synaptic
plasticity can occur in the aPC in the absence of naris closure.
Here, as a high-order input structure, the OFC is a likely candi-
date: The OFC is strongly interconnected to the PC (Illig 2005)
and is believed to engage in conscious odor perception and in
odor categorization (Li et al. 2010; Stalnaker et al. 2014). In the
present study, we observed that OFC stimulation resulted in
LTP in the aPC. As the PC may engage in odor perception, as
well as pattern completion and separation (Barnes et al. 2008;
Chapuis and Wilson 2011; Shakhawat et al. 2014), the PC is
likely to “remember” its past experiences. Considering the
properties of the OFC it is possible that this region assists the
PC in achieving odor discrimination and categorization. This
top–down regulation of information processing in the aPC puts
the OFC in an ideal position to either modulate, or even dictate
when, synaptic plasticity may be engaged in the aPC.
The ability of the OFC to directly impact on information
storage via synaptic plasticity in the aPC was confirmed by
examining intranuclear expression of the immediate early
gene, Arc, as a result of HFS of the OFC. Somatic Arc expression
reflects experience-dependent information encoding at the
neuronal level (Guzowski et al. 1999). In our study, neuronal
Arc expression increased significantly in the ipsilateral aPC fol-
lowing LTP induction via OFC stimulation, in line with the trig-
gering
of
long-term
information
storage
in
the
aPC.
We
detected no changes in expression in the contralateral cortex,
however. The PC of both hemispheres communicates with
each other via commissural projections (Haberly and Price
1978; Luskin and Price 1983) but commissural communication
between aPCs has rarely been explored. However, single unit
responses can be categorized depending on nonresponding and
responding units to unilateral (ipsi- or contralateral) or bilateral
odor stimulation (Wilson 1997) suggesting that not every odor
stimulation results in a bilateral response. This suggests in
turn that the intensity of electrophysiological stimulation may
be decisive in recruiting activation of the contralateral aPC. In
the hippocampus of behaving rats stimulation of the Schaffer
collateral/commissural pathway of one hemisphere evoked a
response in the contralateral CA1 region that was typically
smaller in magnitude than the ipsilaterally evoked field poten-
tial (Kemp and Manahan-Vaughan 2012). The fact that field
potentials evoked by commissural pathway stimulation are
smaller in the contralateral hemisphere (at least for the hippo-
campus), combined with the lower level of Arc induced by OFC
stimulation in the ipsilateral aPC, suggest that the lack of con-
tralateral expression of Arc in the aPC relates to the lower level
of synaptic responses elicited.
Although our study supports an important role for the OFC in
enabling aPC plasticity, it may not comprise the “sole” instigator
of aPC plasticity. Our analysis focused on the components of the
field potential that emerged immediately after the stimulus arti-
fact and thus should correspond to a monosynaptic input. We
cannot, however, entirely exclude that associational inputs (trig-
gered by OFC stimulation) may have contributed to this compo-
nent of the field potential. Daily HFS of the OB results in
potentiation that is selective to late component of the evoked
potential (Stripling et al. 1988, 1991). This suggests that the associ-
ational circuitry of the olfactory cortex also contributes to the
expression of synaptic potentiation in vivo. Further evidence for a
contribution of associative inputs to PC plasticity derives from sen-
sory deprivation studies in neonatal rats that showed that naris clo-
sure for 30 days starting on postnatal day 1 had no effect on lateral
olfactory
tract-evoked
responses
in
the
aPC,
but
enhanced
responses elicited by stimulation of associational connections (Best
and Wilson 2003). These effects may be specifically related to an
early stage of postnatal development, however, as in the present
study, OB–aPC responses were enhanced by sensory deprivation.
Finally, our findings suggest a contribution of the OFC to
aPC plasticity, but also do not rule out the possibility that other
regions such as the posterior PC, the lateral entorhinal cortex,
parts of amygdala, or the mediodorsal thalamus or the intrinsic
circuitry of the aPC, which play a role in odor perception
(Courtiol and Wilson 2017), may have properties that similarly
support synaptic plasticity within the aPC.
In conclusion, our data confirm that in freely behaving adult
rats, synaptic information storage in the form of persistent syn-
aptic plasticity in the aPC does not typically occur following
sole, patterned stimulation of the ascending olfactory pathway,
despite the fact that the aPC possesses an intrinsic ability to
express LTP. Under circumstances where the OFC is activated,
prolonged synaptic plasticity, in the form of LTP occurs, how-
ever, in the aPC. This top–down instruction of the aPC by the
OFC seems quite intuitive given the known involvement of the
PC in odor discrimination and odor rule learning (Roman et al.
1987; Chaillan et al. 1996; Saar et al. 1998; Cohen et al. 2008,
2015), along with the role of the OFC in supporting odor dis-
crimination and categorization. This finding also suggests that
top–down control of olfactory information processing is a major
determinant of long-term information storage in the aPC, and
that the aPC may serve as a repository of memories with regard
to odor discrimination and categorization.
