Abstract
Although, green tea has numerous health benefits, adverse effects with excessive consumption 
have been reported. Using Drosophila melanogaster, a decrease in male fertility with green tea 
was evidenced. Here, the extent of green tea toxicity on development and reproduction was 
investigated. Drosophila melanogaster embryos and larvae were exposed to various doses of 
green tea polyphenols (GTP). Larvae exposed to 10 mg/mL GTP were slower to develop, emerged 
smaller, and exhibited a dramatic decline in the number of emerged offspring. GTP protected flies 
against desiccation but sensitized them to starvation and heat stress. Female offspring exhibited a 
decline in reproductive output and decreased survival while males were unaffected. GTP had a 
negative impact on reproductive organs in both males and females (e.g., atrophic testes in males, 
absence of mature eggs in females). Collectively, the data show that high doses of GTP adversely 
affect development and reproduction of Drosophila melanogaster.

1. Introduction
Green tea, derived from the plant Camellia sinensis, is not only a popular drink worldwide 
but it is also considered a nutraceutical (Mak, 2012) as a neuroprotective (Weinreb, Mandel, 
Amit, & Youdim, 2004), cardioprotective (Basu & Lucas, 2007; Zhong, Huan, Cao, & 
Yang, 2015) and anti-carcinogenic agent (Fujiki, Sueoka, Watanabe, & Suganuma, 2015). In 
spite of reported health benefits with green tea, there are some reports on possible adverse 
effects with its excessive consumption. In 2008, the US Pharmacoepia identified 34 cases of 
cytolytic and cholestatic liver damage associated with long term use or high usage of green 
tea products (Sarma, Ko, & Dog, 2008; Schonthal, 2011). Furthermore, green tea

 components, particularly its primary active flavonoid, epigallocatechin gallate (EGCG), has 
been shown to interact with and influence metabolism of a number of drugs (Andersen et al., 
2013; Cuzzolin, Zaffani, & Benoni, 2006) and cytochrome P450 substrates (Schonthal, 
2011; Yang & Pan, 2012), which could result in therapeutic failure or toxic drug levels. 
During investigations of green tea’s actions on different organ systems, unwarranted effects 
have been cited at high doses suggesting limitations to its use and questioning its safety. 
Such effects include liver (Mazzanti, Di Sotto, & Vitalone, 2015), gastrointestinal 
(Schonthal, 2011), hematological and renal toxicities (Wu, Yao, & Boring, 2011), as well as 
decreased hormonal levels (Chandra, Choudhury, De, & Sarkar, 2011; Kao, Hiipakka, & 
Liao, 2000), sperm counts (Chandra et al., 2011; De Amicis, Santoro, Guido, Russo, & 
Aquila, 2012) and atrophy of reproductive organs (Kapetanovic et al., 2009; Wu et al., 
2011). While such toxicities have been cited in a number of reports, they are often over-
looked, and their mechanisms are not fully understood. In line with some of these 
observations, we have previously reported that while green tea polyphenols (GTP) increased 
the lifespan of Drosophila melanogaster, it resulted in a reduction in male fertility (Lopez et 
al., 2014).
The fruit fly, Drosophila melanogaster, with its evolutionary conserved biological 
pathways, is a commonly used model organism in biomedical research (Jafari, Long, 
Mueller, & Rose, 2006) and an emerging model to screen for adverse drug reactions 
(Avanesian, Semnani, & Jafari, 2009). Evaluation of drug induced developmental and 
reproductive effects is commonly used to assess adverse drug reactions (Siddique et al., 
2009; Weisbrot, Lin, Ye, Blank, & Goodman, 2003).
The Drosophila life cycle consists of distinct developmental stages that include 
embryogenesis, 1st, 2nd and 3rd larval instars, pupae and adults (Kozlova & Thummel, 
2000). Each stage is highly regulated by transcriptional control in response to nutritional, 
environmental and hormonal cues (Kozlova & Thummel, 2000). Considering the highly 
conserved pathways between fruit fly and mammalian reproductive systems, the fruit fly is 
considered an excellent model system for the evaluation of drug toxicities (Avanesian et al., 
2009). Reproductive phenotypes, including egg production, mating behavior and fertility, 
are notable measurable characteristics. Female fecundity, defined as egg production, is a 
complex yet established phenotype to evaluate toxicity and has been used to evaluate the 
reproductive adverse effects of chemotherapeutic agents such as methotrexate (Affleck, 
Neumann, Wong, & Walker, 2006; Kislukhin, King, Walters, Macdonald, & Long, 2013). In 
addition, Drosophila male fertility, defined as production of viable offspring, is also 
considered a phenotype to evaluate drug induced toxicity since it has been shown to be 
influenced by a number of factors such as mating behavior, hormones, testes development, 
reproductive morphology, and spermatogenesis (Tiwari, Pragya, Ram, & Chowdhuri, 2011).
In this study, we observed that GTP at a high dose of 10 mg/mL resulted in delayed 
emergence, smaller offspring, morphological abnormalities in reproductive organs and 
reduced reproductive output. Collectively, our findings indicate that green tea at high doses 
can negatively impact development and reproductive physiology.

 2. Materials and Methods
2.1 Green tea
Green tea polyphenols (GTP) were purchased from LKT Laboratories, Inc. (St. Paul, MN, 
USA). HPLC grade standards, individual catechins, were purchased from Sigma-Aldrich 
(St. Louis, MO, USA) and included epigallocatechin gallate (98% EGCG), epicatechin 
gallate (98% ECG), epigallocatechin (95% EGC), epicatechin (98% EC) and internal 
standard ethylgallate (≥96% EG). Standards were dissolved in water/methanol (1:1, v/v) 
solution and quantified by ESI-LC/MS/MS using a Micromass Waters Quattro Premier XE 
(Waters Corp., Milford, MA, USA) coupled with an Acquity UPLC BEH C18 Column 
(Waters Corp.). The injection volume was 20 μL with an eluent flow rate of 0.3 mL/min. 
Gradient elution solvent A consisted of a mixture of water with 2% acetonitrile (ACN) and 
0.2% ammonium acetate (5mM AA). Solvent B was ACN with 0.2% AA. The eluent 
gradient was ramped from 10% to 90% B in one minute. All acquisitions were performed in 
negative ion mode. Data acquisition and processing was performed using Waters MassLynx 
4.1 (Waters Corp.).
2.2 Fruit fly strains and experimental conditions
All assays were performed using w1118 flies (FBID #3605) obtained from the Bloomington 
Drosophila Stock Center (BDSC) at Indiana University, Bloomington, IN, USA through 
FlyBase. Flies were maintained at 23°C ± 1°C and 60–70% humidity under 12-h light –12-h 
dark cycles. Standard banana–molasses food, composed of 9% carbohydrate content and 
3.6% yeast content, was used in all feeding assays. For developmental feedings, which 
included the exposure of embryos and larvae to GTP, food was prepared by mixing the 
treatment within banana-molasses food and refrigerated for 24h. Unless stated, the GTP 
dose that was used for all the experiments was 10 mg/ml in fly food. In our work, this dose 
resulted in lifespan extension.
2.3 Toxicity and developmental assay
Toxicity assays were performed by preparing larval food as described above at 0, 2.5, 5, and 
10 mg/mL concentrations of GTP. For each concentration, 6 flies per sex were placed in 
each vial (n=120 per treatment) for egg laying. After 24 h, flies were removed and the 
number of eggs laid was recorded. Larval development was checked every 24 h, and the 
number of pupae and emerged offspring, including dates of occurrence, were recorded.
2.4 Size and weight of emerged offspring
For size measurements, 6 flies per treatment (control or 10 mg/mL GTP) per sex were 
randomly selected from the population of emerged offspring. Flies were imaged using a 
ruler for scale, and pictures were analyzed using the open access Image Processing and 
Analysis in Java program (Image J, NIH, Bethesda, MD, USA). Fly length was estimated 
with one line from the top of the head to the end of the abdomen. Scaling in image J was set 
to pixels/centimeter. To determine weight, flies were sedated on a CO2 plate and weighed 
using a Sartorius SE2 Ultra Micro Balance (Bradford, MA, USA) in groups of 10 (n=60 per 
treatment, per sex).

 2.5 Measurement of DNA content
A total of 5 flies per sex, per treatment, were weighed and flash frozen. Flies were 
homogenized in DNA isolation buffer (50 mM Tris-HCL, pH 8.0, 5 mM 
ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid (EDTA), 100 mM NaCl, 0.5% SDS) and supplemented with 
proteinase K (0.5 mg/mL final concentration) and digested overnight at 55°C with mild 
shaking. The samples were then extracted by standard phenol-chloroform procedures and 
precipitated by ethanol. DNA content was quantified and normalized to fly weight.
2.6 Fertility assay
Male fertility was performed as outlined in our previous work, Lopez et al. (2014), with the 
following modifications: 6 male and 6 female mating pairs were used per vial instead of 1 
mating pair. Embryos and larvae were exposed to GTP or control throughout their 
development. Offspring were collected for fertility assays.
2.7 Dissections of testes and ovaries
Six flies per sex from each treatment (control or GTP) were randomly selected for 
dissection. Using fine forceps, the internal reproductive organs were teased out of the 
abdomen into a drop of phosphate buffer saline (PBS). Samples were stained with DAPI 
nuclei stain (Sigma-Aldrich, St. Louis, MO, USA) and were visualized under fluorescence 
using a Zeiss Axio Scope.A1. (Carl Zeiss Industrial Metrology LLC., Maple Grove, MN, 
USA)
2.8 Measurement of water, lipid and protein contents
Water, lipid and soluble protein levels were measured as previously described in Schriner et 
al., (Schriner et al., 2013). Flies were collected and weighed as described above. Water 
content was determined after drying flies for 48 h at 70°C, re-weighing them and taking the 
difference in weights. Lipid content was determined after lipid extraction with diethyl ether. 
Samples were dried and re-weighed. Fat content was determined by taking the difference in 
the weights before and after diethyl ether extraction divided by the initial weight. Soluble 
protein was determined from the supernatant of homogenized flies and measured by reaction 
with Coomassie Brilliant Blue normalized to fly weight.
2.9 Stress assays
A total of 120 flies per sex per treatment were used for each stress assay. For desiccation, 
flies were housed in empty vials and deaths were recorded every 2 hours. For starvation, 
flies were housed in vials containing 2% agarose to provide moisture without any food and 
deaths were recorded every 4 hours. To evaluate heat tolerance, flies were housed at 37° C 
and deaths recorded every hour. To evaluate the protection against superoxide, flies were 
exposed to 12.5 mM of paraquat (98% methyl viologen dichloride hydrate, Sigma-Aldrich, 
St. Louis, MO, USA) mixed in standard banana molasses food and deaths were recorded 
every 4 h. Survival analysis for all stress assays was determined by log-rank Mantel-Cox 
test.

 2.10 Gene expression assay
Heat shock protein expressions were performed as described in Schriner et al. (Schriner et 
al., 2013). In brief, flies were frozen in groups of 10 and RNA was extracted with TRIzol 
reagent (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA, USA). Samples were treated with DNase (New England 
Biolabs, Ipswich, MA, USA) and converted to cDNA by the iScript cDNA synthesis kit 
(Bio-Rad, Hercules, CA, USA). Quantitative PCR was performed on a MiniOpticon realtime 
PCR system with SYBR green dye (Bio-Rad). Relative amplification was calculated by the 
threshold cycle of each respective gene divided by the threshold cycle of the reference gene, 
RNA polymerase II. Primer sequences and product sizes were as follows. RNA pol II 
forward: AGGGCGGCGAGGACATGGAT, and reverse: 
CGACGGCTGGTAGTGACCGC. HSP70 forward: ACCAAGGGGTGTGCCCCAGA, and 
reverse: CTTGGCCTTGCCCGTGCTCA. HSP22 forward: 
TTGGCGGATGGCCGAGGAGA, and reverse: AGCGCCACACTCCAAACGGG. Primers 
were designed by NCBI/Primer-BLAST.
2.11 Lifespan assay
A total of 120 emerged offspring from control and GTP were collected and utilized for 
lifespan assays. For this particular assay, the flies were no longer exposed to GTP-treated 
food throughout their life; the only exposure to GTP was during development as described 
above. Flies were transferred every 2 days to fresh food and deaths were recorded until all 
flies died.
2.12 Statistical Analysis
All statistical analysis was performed using GraphPad Prism (GraphPad Software, San 
Diego, CA, USA). Statistical evaluation of differences between treatment groups was 
analyzed by Student’s t-test. Data analysis of green tea and control groups separated by sex 
was analyzed by two-way ANOVA. The Mantel–Cox log-rank test was used to evaluate fly 
survival in stress and lifespan assays. P values < 0.05 were considered statistically 
significant.
3. RESULTS
3.1 Composition of green tea polyphenols
Analysis of the GTP by ESI-MS revealed 54% EGCG, 11% ECG, 8% EC, 6% EGC and 
<0.1% caffeine as summarized in Table 1. The composition of the green tea that we used in 
this study was consistent with the composition of standardized green tea extracts used in 
scientific studies (Svoboda, Vlčková, & Nováková, 2015).
3.2 Green tea polyphenols impair development and reduce offspring size and weight at a 
high dose
The effect of green tea on Drosophila development was evaluated by exposing embryonic 
and larval stages to a mixture of GTP at varying doses. The number of eggs laid by adults 
exposed to GTP was normal at all doses (Fig. 1A). No effects on development involving 
pupation and emergence were observed at the 0, 2.5 or 5 mg/mL doses but GTP at 10

 mg/mL significantly inhibited the formation of pupae and subsequent offspring emergence 
(Fig. 1A). A surprising finding was the extended delay in pupation and emergence of 
offspring as doses of GTP increased (Fig. 1B).
Male and females from the GTP treatment group emerged as smaller adult flies compared to 
controls (Fig. 2A and 2D). Recorded lengths from a random sample from each treatment 
showed a significant reduction in fly length by GTP for both males (Fig. 2B) and females 
(Fig. 2E). This observation was further confirmed by measuring weights from each group. A 
dose-dependent reduction in weight was observed in both sexes with the greatest reduction 
occurring at 10 mg/mL of GTP (Fig. 2C and 2F).
3.3 Green tea polyphenols reduce cell numbers
To evaluate whether the emergence of smaller offspring by GTP is the result of reduced cell 
size or reduction of cell numbers, we measured the total DNA content relative to fruit fly 
weights. We found no significant increase in the total DNA content/body weight ratio in 
either sex (Fig. 3) which is consistent with fewer cells in GTP treated flies.
3.4 Green tea polyphenols fed during larval stages impact subsequent reproductive output 
of adult females
It is well established that reproductive output in flies, egg production from females or viable 
offspring from males, is a marker of toxicity in Drosophila (Avanesian et al., 2009; Tiwari 
et al., 2011). We evaluated the reproductive output of emerged offspring after being treated 
with GTP during development. Female offspring exposed to GTP exhibited a significant 
reduction in reproduction as adults compared to control (Fig. 4A, 4B, 4C). The fertility of 
male flies, or number of eggs laid by treated males upon mating with females, was not 
affected by the treatment (Fig. 4D, 4E). Interestingly, an increase in offspring numbers was 
observed (Fig. 4F).
3.5 Green tea polyphenols cause morphological defects of reproductive organs
Reduced fly fertility can be associated with a number of factors including morphological 
defects in reproductive organs (Anderson, 1945; Siddique et al., 2009). Male offspring 
emerged from control food had normal reproductive structures such as full testes, seminal 
vesicles and accessory glands (Fig. 5A). However, male offspring from the GTP group 
exhibited atrophy of reproductive organs and a dramatic reduction of the number of nuclei in 
testes (Fig. 5B). Similarly, control females had normal ovaries and recognizable structures 
including ovarioles and mature eggs (Fig. 5C), whereas emerged females from GTP group 
revealed smaller ovarian structures and absence of mature eggs (Fig. 5D).
3.6 Green tea polyphenols increase water content and decrease lipid levels without 
effecting protein levels
Increased water, lipid and protein levels are often associated with enhanced stress resistance 
and increased survival (Chippindalet, 1998). Offspring emerged from GTP food had 
increased water (Fig. 6A) but reduced lipid (Fig. 6B) contents in both sexes. No changes in 
soluble protein levels were observed (Fig. 6C).

 3.7 Green tea polyphenols confer a modest protection against desiccation but sensitize 
flies to starvation, heat and oxidative stress
Flies emerged from GTP food were evaluated for their ability to confer protection against 
stress, a marker of health and survival in Drosophila melanogaster (Rose, Vu, Park, & 
Graves, 1992). Flies emerged from GTP were resistant to desiccation (Fig. 7A and 7B) but 
sensitized to starvation (Fig. 7C and 7D) and heat stress (Fig. 7E and 7F).
To evaluate the protective ability of GTP against oxidative stress, we subjected flies to 
paraquat, a superoxide generator. While we observed no significant differences in survival 
for males from paraquat exposure (Fig. 7G), female survival was significantly reduced (Fig. 
7H). The expression levels of heat shock proteins (HSPs), specifically HSP70 and HSP22, 
were measured as a marker of cellular damage under a stress-induced environment, in this 
case caused by GTP. We observed that GTP caused a significant up-regulation in the 
expression levels of HSP70 (Fig. 8A) and HSP22 (Fig. 8B) in male flies. While an increase 
in HSP70 and HSP22 may be present in females as well, the effect was not statistically 
significant.
3.8 Green tea polyphenols reduce adult fly survival in females but has no effect on male 
lifespan
Flies were fed GTP only during early development and the lifespan of emerged offspring 
was examined. Female flies exhibited a 17% reduction in overall lifespan (Fig. 9A), whereas 
males were unaffected (Fig. 9B).
4 DISCUSSION
Previously, we reported that green tea polyphenols (GTP) fed to adult Drosophila 
melanogaster increased male mean lifespan by up to 19% but resulted in a decrease in male 
fertility at doses ≥10 mg/mL (Lopez et al., 2014). This adverse effect on male fertility was 
surprising and warranted further investigation on the extent of toxicity caused by green tea. 
In this work, we explored the impact of GTP on health by exposing Drosophila 
melanogaster to GTP during early stages of development. We surmised that since 
developing embryos and larvae are highly susceptible to environmental factors, exposing 
flies to GTP during early development would amplify subsequent negative phenotypic 
effects in emerged adults. Our results showed a number of phenotypic effects by GTP, most 
notably a delay in emergence, smaller offspring, reduced reproductive output by females and 
abnormalities of reproductive organs in both sexes. Moreover, we evaluated whether GTP 
provided any protection against stress and found that emerged GTP-treated offspring were 
resistant to desiccation but were sensitized to starvation and heat stress, phenotypes 
consistent with water and lipid changes in flies. Lastly, female flies emerged from GTP-
treated food exhibited a significant decrease in survival whereas male fly lifespan was 
unaffected.
Numerous studies, particularly those investigating the effects of environmental pollutants on 
Drosophila development, have revealed that flies exposed to adverse food conditions 
emerge as smaller adults and require longer time periods for development (Böhni et al., 
1999; Gupta et al., 2007; Siddique et al., 2009). It has been suggested that these observations

 are the result of somatic effects caused by the relevant treatment (Siddique et al., 2009). 
However, studies evaluating adverse effects of green tea on organismal development are 
scarce. Epicatechin gallate (ECG) and epigallocatechin gallate (EGCG), which make up 
more than half of green tea’s polyphenolic composition, have been shown to induce 
embryonic toxicity and impair development in mouse blastocysts. These compounds also 
induced apoptosis with a corresponding decrease in cell numbers, decreased implantation 
rates, and resulted in embryos with lower fetal weight (Fan & Chan, 2014; Tu, Chen, & 
Chan, 2010). These observations are consistent with our results showing that Drosophila 
embryos subjected to green tea-treated food had a remarkable reduction in offspring 
numbers, and the larvae that successfully emerged into adults were dramatically smaller in 
body size than respective controls. We questioned whether the small body size was the result 
of a decrease in individual cell sizes or a decrease in cell numbers. If there was a decrease in 
cell size, the GTP treated flies would have the same number of cells, and hence total DNA 
content, as controls. Since GTP-treated flies are smaller compared to controls, this would 
result in an increased DNA content/body weight ratio, which we did not see. Therefore, our 
results are consistent with either elevated apoptosis or decreased cell division or both. The 
striking developmental defects by green tea can be attributed to green tea’s pro-oxidant and 
pro-apoptotic activity. In fact, green tea’s ability to induce apoptosis is the basis of its 
reported classification as an anti-carcinogenic agent by initiating cell-cycle arrest and 
growth inhibition in carcinoma cells (Ghasemi-Pirbaluti et al., 2015; Gupta, Ahmad, 
Nieminen, & Mukhtar, 2000; Lambert & Elias, 2010). This mechanism is likely the cause of 
green tea’s impairment of fly development since Drosophila development is highly 
dependent on cell cycle progression and cell survival, events which are influenced in part by 
environmental factors (Böhni et al., 1999).
Hormetic effects of GTP may provide an explanation about these observed adverse effects. 
Hormesis is a phenomenon in which low dose exposure to a potential toxic compound is 
beneficial but higher doses of the same compound become harmful (Murakami, 2014; Son, 
Camandola, & Mattson, 2008). In flies, beneficial effects after exposure to hormetic 
compounds can lead to increased resistance against further stressors such as environmental 
and oxidative stress (Birringer, 2011; Mattson, 2008). With the exception of desiccation, 
emerged offspring from GTP were more susceptible to heat, starvation and oxidative stress. 
The protective effect exhibited by GTP against desiccation and sensitization to starvation 
could be explained by the increased levels in water and decreased levels in lipid content, 
respectfully, since such phenotypes are known to be positively correlated with one another 
(Chippindalet, 1998). Green tea’s inability to protect against superoxide free radicals could 
be due to a higher dose of GTP resulting in green tea’s pro-oxidant toxic effect (Forester & 
Lambert, 2011). Some of our results may appear to disagree with our previous work where 
we did not observe protective effects against desiccation, and GTP did not increase water 
content (Lopez et al., 2014). The reason for this discrepancy is likely due to feeding GTP to 
adult flies in our previous work versus exposing embryos to GTP in this work. Presumably, 
green tea could act through different mechanisms at different stages of fly development. 
Early embryonic development is a phase dependent on cell cycle progression and larval 
transitions (Kozlova & Thummel, 2000; Lehner & O’Farrell, 1989) but in adult stages, flies 
are primarily post-mitotic (Lehner & O’Farrell, 1989). Studies have shown that green tea

 constituents can bind to DNA and RNA, inhibit replication, increase topoisomerase II-
mediated DNA cleavage, induce apoptosis and attenuate cell cycle progression at the G1/G0 
phase (Bandele & Osheroff, 2008; Gupta et al., 2000; Kuzuhara, Sei, Yamaguchi, 
Suganuma, & Fujiki, 2006; Saiko et al., 2015). It is plausible that GTP is acting in this 
manner to inhibit growth and development of Drosophila melanogaster.
We observed remarkable abnormalities in the reproductive organs of both male and female 
flies. While male testes showed fewer nuclei and were smaller in size, female ovaries 
appeared to be almost entirely absent of mature eggs indicating that females emerged from 
GTP-treated food were more susceptible to the effects of GTP than males. The toxic effects 
of GTP on the female reproductive system were further evident by the reduced number of 
eggs laid and viable offspring produced. Male fertility did not appear to be largely affected. 
These sex-specific effects on male and female reproduction could be due to the difference in 
the numbers and sizes of the male and female gametes. Since sperm are so small and 
numerous, a significant reduction in gamete production could result in a nearly undetectable 
effect on the fertility and organ morphology. Whereas in females, eggs make up a large 
proportion of the female reproductive system, and similar degree of impairment in gamete 
production could result in marked morphological and reproductive effects.
Hormetic compounds, such as those found in green tea, are known to induce heat shock 
proteins (HSPs), stress proteins that function during harmful conditions to aid cell survival 
by binding and refolding damaged proteins (Mattson, 2008). Studies evaluating the toxic 
effects of chemical pollutants on Drosophila utilize the expression levels of HSPs, 
particularly the induction of HSP70, as a marker of stress response and cellular damage 
(Siddique et al., 2009). The small mitochondrial heat shock protein, HSP22, is essential in 
the maintenance of protein homeostasis and up-regulated in response to heat and oxidative 
stress (Bhole, Allikian, & Tower, 2004; Morrow & Tanguay, 2015). Additionally, both 
HSP70 and HSP22 are up-regulated during Drosophila aging (Tower, 2011). We observed a 
sex-specific effect of GTP on HSP70 and HSP22. Emerged male offspring from GTP-
treated food exhibited an up-regulation in HSP70 and HSP22. The effect was not observed 
in females. Previous studies have shown that green tea and its primary active flavonoid, 
EGCG, induce HSPs as a protective mechanism to combat stress-induced environments and 
increase survival (Abbas & Wink, 2009; Zhang, Jie, Zhang, & Zhao, 2009). In our study, 
HSPs were up-regulated by GTP treatment alone which is indicative of stress caused by the 
treatment itself.
Additionally, we explored the effect of GTP on HSP22 as it has been suggested as a 
predictive biomarker for Drosophila survival (Yang & Tower, 2009). Yang and Tower 
(2009) identified that flies robustly expressing HSP22 at a younger age tended to die sooner. 
Additionally, over-expression of HSP22 made flies more sensitive to heat and oxidative 
stress and reduced fly lifespan (Bhole et al., 2004). Similar to our results, flies exposed to 
GTP exhibited higher levels of HSP22 which sensitized flies to stress and compromised 
survival. Female flies, in particular, were more susceptible to oxidative stress by paraquat 
than male flies. In addition to sex-specific differences that affect fly lifespan (Adler, 
Cassidy, Fricke, & Bonduriansky, 2013; Maklakov et al., 2008) and those described above, 
we speculate the sensitivity to oxidative stress induced by GTP contributed to an overall

 shorter lifespan for females. Lastly, the observed difference in HSP expression between 
control and GTP-treated groups suggested that at high doses, GTP is detrimental and leads 
to cell loss and subsequent morphological changes.
In summary, our results demonstrate that high concentrations of green tea impair 
development and reproduction of Drosophila melanogaster, as demonstrated by delayed 
emergence, small offspring sizes, reduced offspring numbers and atrophy of reproductive 
organs. The conserved biological pathways, including similarities between reproductive and 
developmental genes and hormones in flies and humans, make flies a valid model organism 
to evaluate drug induced adverse effects (Avanesian et al., 2009; Kislukhin et al., 2013; 
Kozlova & Thummel, 2000). Our results indicate that when consumed at high doses, green 
tea could potentially be detrimental to human physiological processes such as development 
and reproduction. However, it is difficult to draw direct conclusions on human implications 
since the mechanisms of bioavailability of polyphenols in both mammals and Drosophila 
remain poorly understood.

 Fig. 1. The effect of green tea polyphenols on development
Green tea polyphenols fed to larvae during development had no effect on adult emergence at 
0, 2.5, and 5 mg/mL doses (P>0.05). However, a significant reduction in pupae and adults 
was observed at the 10 mg/mL dose (P<0.0001) (A). Time to development was significantly 
increased as doses of GTP were increased (P<0.05) (B). Data are presented as means ± 
SEM, n=10 vials with 6 mating pairs (A) and n=3 experimental trials (B) and analyzed by 
two-way ANOVA.

 Fig. 2. Phenotypic effects of emerged offspring from food treated with green tea polyphenols
Emerged offspring from the 10 mg/mL dose of green tea polyphenols were noticeably 
smaller in size than controls (A, D). Lengths of both males (B) and females (E) were 
significantly smaller after being exposed to 10 mg/mL GTP during development (n=6 per 
treatment per sex, ***P=0.0005, student’s t-test). Weight of emerged offspring also 
decreased in a dose dependent manner for both males (C) and females (F) with the greatest 
reduction occurring at the 10 mg/mL dose (n=60 per treatment per sex, *P =0.01, 
**P=0.001 and ***P<0.001).

 Fig. 3. DNA content in flies treated with green tea polyphenols
DNA content isolated from treated flies normalized to body weight was used to determine 
whether cell numbers were affected by GTP treatment. Flies treated with GTP did not 
exhibit an increase in DNA content normalized to body weight. Data are presented as means 
± SEM, n=30 per treatment, per sex and analyzed by two-way ANOVA.

 Fig. 4. Reproductive output of adult Drosophila melanogaster fed green tea polyphenols during 
larval stages
The fertility of emerged offspring from GTP-treated food was determined by measuring the 
number of eggs, pupae and adults formed from each sex over a 10-day mating period. 
Female flies exhibited a significant reduction in overall reproductive output including eggs 
laid (A), pupae formed (B) and emerged offspring (C) (P<0.0001). Male flies showed no 
difference in fertility by the number of eggs laid (D) or pupae (E) formed (P>0.05) however, 
an increase in the number of emerged flies was observed (P=0.01) (F). Data are presented as 
means ± SEM (n=60 per treatment per sex) and analyzed by two-way ANOVA. P >0.05 are 
not significant.

 Fig. 5. The effect of green tea polyphenols on reproductive organs
Reproductive organs of emerged offspring from GTP-treated food evaluated by DAPI nuclei 
stain revealed morphological abnormalities. Male reproductive organs from control males 
(A) showed normal and full structures of accessory glands (AG), seminal vesicles (SV) and 
testes (T). Males emerged from GTP food exhibited an overall reduction in organ size, 
atrophy of testes and reduced number of nuclei (B). Ovaries from control females (C) 
revealed normal organ structures including the presence of ovarioles (ov), mature eggs (E) 
and ovarian duct (Od). Females exposed to GTP exhibited a dramatic reduction in ovary size 
and absence of mature eggs (D).

Larval fed GTP offspring exhibited higher levels of water (A) and lower total body fat 
content (B) than controls (P<0.0001). Offspring did not exhibit significant changes in 
soluble protein content (P>0.05) (C). Data are presented as means ± SEM (n=60 per 
treatment per sex) and analyzed by two-way ANOVA with Bonferroni post-test. P>0.05 are

 Fig. 7. The effect of green tea polyphenols on the tolerance towards desiccation, starvation, heat 
and paraquat
Offspring emerged from GTP-treated food exhibited a modest protection against desiccation 
in male (A) and female (B) flies. However, GTP sensitized offspring to starvation (C, D), 
and heat stress (E, F). Male offspring from GTP-treated food did not exhibit any significant 
reduction in survival with exposure to paraquat (G). Female offspring from GTP-treated 
food exhibited a significant reduction in survival when exposed to paraquat (H). The sample 
sizes were n=120 per sex and per treatment. P values were calculated by Mantel-Cox log 
rank test.

in the expression levels of HSP70 and HSP22 was observed in females as well, the effect 
was not significant (P>0.05). Data are presented as means ± SEM (n=60 per treatment per

Female Drosophila exposed to a 10 mg/mL treatment of GTP during larval stages 
subsequently exhibited a 17% decrease in adult lifespan (A). Emerged male offspring from 
treated food were not affected from the treatment (B). The sample sizes were n=120 per sex 
and per treatment. P values were calculated by Mantel-Cox log rank test.
