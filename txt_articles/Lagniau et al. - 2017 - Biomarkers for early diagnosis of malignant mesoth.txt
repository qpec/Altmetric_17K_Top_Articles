ABSTRACT
Early diagnosis of malignant pleural mesothelioma (MPM) is a challenge for 
clinicians. The disease is usually detected in an advanced stage which precludes 
curative treatment. We assume that only new and non-invasive biomarkers allowing 
earlier detection will result in better patient management and outcome. Many efforts 
have already been made to find suitable biomarkers in blood and pleural effusions, but 
have not yet resulted in a valid and reproducible diagnostic one. In this review, we 
will highlight the strengths and shortcomings of blood and fluid based biomarkers and 
highlight the potential of breath analysis as a non-invasive screening tool for MPM. 
This method seems very promising in the early detection of diverse malignancies, 
because exhaled breath contains valuable information on cell and tissue metabolism. 
Research that focuses on breath biomarkers in MPM is in its early days, but the few 
studies that have been performed show promising results. We believe a breathomics-
based biomarker approach should be further explored to improve the follow-up and 
management of asbestos exposed individuals.
INTRODUCTION
Malignant pleural mesothelioma (MPM) is a rare 
and aggressive cancer originating from the mesothelial 
cells of the pleura. MPM is mostly an occupational disease, 
affecting more men than women [1]. Although the causal 
link to asbestos exposure is well documented, and the latter’s 
industrial use has been fully banned in Europe, asbestos is 
still being processed in large parts of the developing world 
[2]. Asbestos is a general name for naturally occurring 
mineral silicate fibers (e.g. serpentine and amphiboles), 
popular for industrial usage because of their high tensile 
strength and resistance to thermal and chemical degradation 
[3]. In 1960 already, Wagner et al. reported that asbestos had 
genotoxic and carcinogenic properties [4]. When asbestos 
fibers are inhaled in the lungs, they cause oxidative stress 
and chronic inflammation. Because of the high iron content 
of these fibers, Fenton-like reactions take place, resulting in 
the constant generation of reactive oxygen species (ROS). 
Furthermore, chronic inflammation is due to the prolonged 
phagocytic activity of macrophages engulfing the inhaled 
asbestos fibers [5]. This process generates both ROS and 
reactive nitrogen species (RNS), which both cause DNA 
damage, resulting in large-scale alterations in chromosomal 
loci harboring tumor-suppressor genes such as NF2 
and BAP1 [6]. Hence, mesothelioma is the prototypical 
illustration of the genotoxic effects of protracted tissue 
inflammation, culminating in carcinogenesis with a long 
latency period after initial asbestos exposure. 
There are 3 major histological subtypes of MPM [7]: 
epithelioid mesothelioma is the most common one and has 
the best prognosis, and sarcomatoid mesothelioma showing 
the worst. Biphasic mesothelioma has both epithelioid and 
sarcomatoid subtypes combined in various proportions.

The prognosis of MPM is poor due to its non-
specific clinical manifestations, responsible for a diagnosis 
in an advanced stage. Currently, diagnostic procedures 
for MPM involve imaging tests and a biopsy. However, 
there is an unmet need of sensitive and non-invasive 
screening tools that allow an early detection of the disease, 
considered a precondition for the improvement of the 
presently low 5 year survival rate of less than 5% [8]. 
Therefore, biomarkers can be explored and can be 
useful within three aspects of the clinical management 
of MPM: early diagnosis (diagnostic biomarkers), 
prognosis (prognostic biomarkers) and prediction of 
treatment outcome (predictive biomarkers) [9]. This 
review will focus on diagnostic biomarkers. The required 
characteristics of this type of biomarkers depend on 
whether they will be used for diagnosis or screening. In 
case of using the biomarker for diagnosis, the specificity 
and positive predictive value (PPV) should be high enough 
in order to confirm the disease in a true positive population. 
In a screening setting however, the sensitivity and negative 
predictive value (NPV) of the biomarker are important for 
ruling out the disease in a true negative population. 
This review will highlight the findings of current 
research efforts concerning the use of several biomarkers 
for early diagnosis of MPM, and focus on the potential of 
breath analysis within this scope. 
Diagnostic biomarkers in mesothelioma: An 
overview of current research
Methods
We searched for relevant studies concerning 
biomarkers in mesothelioma through MEDLINE (PubMed 
Database) and Web of Science using the following 
keywords and their combinations: “mesothelioma”, 
“biomarker”, “diagnosis”, “tumor marker”, “mesothelin”, 
“fibulin-3”, “osteopontin”, “megakaryocyte potentiating 
factor”, “galectin-3”, “thioredoxin” and “HMGB-1”, 
“RNA”, “lung cancer”, “volatile organic compounds”, 
“electronic nose”, “ion mobility spectrometry”, “GC-MS”, 
“headspace”, “cell line”, “asbestos”, “exhaled breath”, 
“breath analysis” and “metabolomics”.
Table 1 summarizes the results from 14 articles 
describing different biomarkers found in blood and/or 
pleural effusions. In this table, we only included the data 
involving the differentiation between individuals who 
have been diagnosed with MPM and the at-risk group 
of people exposed to asbestos: healthy asbestos-exposed 
individuals and/or patients with benign asbestos-related 
pleura-pulmonary conditions e.g. asbestosis, pleural 
plaques and fibrosis. 
Protein biomarkers in blood and/or pleural effusions
One of the most extensively evaluated serum 
biomarkers is soluble mesothelin-related peptide (SMRP), also 
known as soluble mesothelin. SMRP is a protein derived from 
the MSLN gene, that is initially translated into a precursor 
protein of ~69 kDa. This protein is processed by proteolytic 
reactions, resulting in a cell-surface bound polypeptide of 
~40 kDa named mesothelin, and a soluble polypeptide of 
~30 kDa named megakaryocyte potentiating factor (MPF). 
Mesothelin and SMRP have an identical NH2-terminus, but 
a unique COOH-terminus [10]. Mesothelin is expressed on 
the mesothelium of the pleural, pericardial and peritoneal 
membrane and plays an important role in cell adhesion and 
both cell-to-cell recognition and signaling by interaction with 
Cancer Antigen (CA) 125 [11]. MPF in itself has oncogenic 
potential by its ability to suppress cell death [12]. 
Both the diagnostic and prognostic value of SMRP 
as a potential stand-alone marker have been extensively 
studied, with reports showing that MPM patients have 
significantly higher levels of SMRP, which makes this 
biomarker interesting as a diagnostic tool [13–25].
Asbestos-exposed individuals seem to have higher SMRP 
concentrations than individuals who haven’t been exposed 
to asbestos, regardless of the presence of pleural disease. 
Therefore, serum SMRP levels can also be a marker of 
asbestos exposure [26]. SMRP levels have been studied in 
both serum (S-SMRP) and pleural effusions (PE-SMRP)
[27]. PE-SMRP has a better diagnostic performance 
in differentiating MPM from other malignancies and 
asbestos-related benign diseases. Despite of its high 
specificity, S-SMRP shows a lack of sensitivity. Therefore, 
further research has focused on the combination of serum 
mesothelin with several other biomarkers in panels in 
order to improve their respective diagnostic accuracy. An 
interesting combination is that of SMRP with CA125. 
However, combining these biomarkers did not improve 
sensitivity for detecting MPM over SMRP alone [28]. 
CA125 is a large transmembrane mucin protein found on 
the cell surface of mesothelial cells, and is routinely used 
as tumor marker in ovarian carcinoma. Evidence shows that 
CA125 is involved in cell-mediated immune response [11]. 
A correlation has been shown between the serum 
mesothelin levels and the histological subtype of the 
tumor. More specifically, patients with epithelioid 
mesothelioma show higher levels of serum mesothelin 
than those with sarcomatoid mesothelioma. The same 
correlation has been observed for MPF [29].
Osteopontin (OPN) and MPF are also biomarkers that 
show increased levels in patients with established MPM. 
The diagnostic performance of these markers was evaluated 
in multiple studies [13, 30–33], but both glycoproteins lack 
sensitivity as stand-alone biomarkers. OPN is a secreted 
glycoprotein that facilitates recovery of the organism after 
injury or infection. It regulates cell migration and stimulates 
cellular signaling pathways via diverse receptors that can be 
found on most cell types. OPN also plays an important role 
in modulating immune and inflammatory responses [34]. 
It appears that OPN can be useful in the differentiation 
between asbestos-exposed persons who do not have cancer 
and mesothelioma patients who have been exposed to

asbestos [35]. One study has shown that combining SMRP 
and OPN improves the diagnostic accuracy over SMRP 
alone [33]. However, another comparative study did not 
confirm this result [31]. The same has been observed for 
the combination of SMRP and MPF [31]. 
The diagnostic accuracy of SMRP and MPF have 
been examined and compared with each other in both 
serum and pleural effusions [36]. Both biomarkers 
seem to have an equivalent diagnostic accuracy in these 
biological samples.

Other interesting biomarkers that have been 
investigated, are C-C chemokine ligand 2 (CCL2) 
and galectin-3 (LGALS3), both measured in patients 
with pleural effusions[37, 38]. This restricts their use 
to a group of patients with an already higher a priori 
likelihood of mesothelioma than asymptomatic asbestos-
exposed individuals. CCL2 is a chemokine involved in 
the recruitment of mononuclear phagocytes into inflamed 
and/or neoplastic tissues. LGALS3 is a lectin protein 
that is abundantly secreted by tumor cells and tumor-
associated macrophages. It chemo-attracts macrophages, 
suppresses T-cell function, and directly supports tumor 
cell invasion [39]. CCL2 levels follow the same trend 
as the aforementioned biomarkers and are increased in 
MPM patients, but unexpectedly, circulating galectin-3 
concentrations are decreased in the case of MPM [38]. 
The diagnostic accuracy of a panel consisting of SMRP, 
CCL2 and LGALS3 was investigated, and compared with 
that of SMRP alone [37], with the biomarker combination 
resulting in a better diagnostic performance. Secretory 
leukocyte peptidase inhibitor (SLPI), which has versatile 
tissue-protective functions, has been studied as a potential 
biomarker in MPM as well, but results showed that 
this protein does not outperform the abovementioned 
biomarkers [37].
Cellular pathways involved in redox processes would 
be expected to produce potential biomarkers in MPM as 
well. Accordingly, a study showed that thioredoxin-1 
(TRX-1), a protein with anti-oxidative activity, is elevated 
in MPM patients in comparison with asbestos-exposed 
individuals that did not develop MPM [40]. 
Fibulin-3 is a member of the extracellular 
glycoprotein fibulin family and plays an important role 
in skeletal development [41–43]. Plasma fibulin-3 is able 
to distinguish MPM patients from controls [41]. SMRP, 
Fibulin-3 and TRX-1 have also been investigated in a 
study that also studied the potential of syndecan-1 (SDC-
1) and epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) [44]. 
This study showed that SMRP and TRX-1 are the most 
valuable serum biomarkers for early detection of MPM. 
SDC-1 is a transmembrane heparan sulphate proteoglycan, 
which functions as an extracellular matrix receptor and is 
involved with modulation of neovascularization. EGFR is 
a member of the receptor tyrosine kinase family that plays 
an important role in tumorigenesis [44].
HMGB-1, also known as high-mobility group box 
1 protein, is found in the nucleus of healthy mesothelial 
cells, but once these cells are exposed to asbestos, HMGB-
1 is translocated to the cytoplasm and into the extracellular 
space. The release of HMGB-1 induces the secretion of 
TNF-α by macrophages, resulting in the protection of the 
asbestos-exposed mesothelial cells against asbestos-related 
cell death and in chronic inflammatory response [45]. Total 
serum HMGB-1 levels have been shown to differentiate 
asbestos-exposed individuals from non-exposed healthy 
subjects [42]. A specific HMGB-1 isoform, namely 
hyper-acetylated HMGB-1, even outperforms previously 
described biomarkers. Hyperacetylation of HMGB-1 
translocates this damage-associated molecular pattern 
to the cytosolic and subsequent extracellular space, 
promoting inflammation. This marker was able to 
discriminate between MPM patients and asbestos-exposed 
individuals without MPM or non-exposed individuals with 
100% sensitivity and specificity. Combining fibulin-3 with 
either total or hyper-acetylated HMGB-1 improved both 
sensitivity and specificity for differentiating MPM patients 
from individuals with non-MPM pleural effusions. 
Nevertheless, there are some limitations that have to be 
considered with regard to HMGB-1. The sample size in 
this study was small and the different patient groups were 
not matched for factors such as age, sex and smoking 
status, which could lead to confounding effects. In order 
to use this interesting biomarker in a clinical setting, these 
results require validation in an independent cohort. 
In conclusion, there is a plethora of blood and 
pleural fluid biomarkers that can potentially be used 
for early-stage diagnosis of MPM, mostly measured by 
ELISA-based immuno-enzymatic assays. Nevertheless, 
most of these components lack sufficient sensitivity and/
or specificity in distinguishing MPM patients from healthy 
asbestos-exposed individuals and persons with asbestos-
related benign diseases. In order to clear the way for 
clinical implementation, certain pitfalls should be taken 
into account. The study population has to be chosen very 
carefully as there are confounding variables that influence 
biomarker levels [46]. For instance, our group described 
the association of levels of SMRP and MPF with age, 
glomerular filtration rate (GFR), disease stage and body 
mass index (BMI) [14].
Circulating non-coding RNAs
Non-coding RNAs (ncRNAs) are nucleic acids 
that lack protein-coding potential and contain two major 
classes: microRNAs (miRNAs) and long non-coding 
RNAs (lncRNAs).
MiRNA’s are small ncRNAs of 17 to 22 nucleotides 
long, regulating protein translation through several well-
characterized mechanisms [47]. MiRNA signatures in 
tissue and blood have been extensively investigated as 
diagnostic and prognostic biomarkers in different types of 
cancers. 
Evidence has shown that miRNAs are dysregulated 
in malignant pleural mesothelioma and that specific 
miRNAs seem to play a key role in MPM development 
and progression. Therefore, these miRNAs could be useful 
as MPM markers [48]. Benjamin et al. identified miRNA 
biomarkers that allow differential diagnosis of MPM 
[49]. They developed a diagnostic assay that is based on 
miRNA expression in tissue. This assay is based on hsa-
miR-200c and hsa-miR-192 that both show overexpression 
in lung adenocarcinoma and carcinomas that frequently 
 Oncotarget
53755
www.impactjournals.com/oncotarget
metastasize to the pleura and on hsa-miR-193-3p that is 
overexpressed in MPM. 
Ak et al. found that certain microRNAs in tissue 
are significantly upregulated in MPM compared to benign 
asbestos-related pleural effusions [50]. More specifically, 
the following microRNAs allowed differentiation between 
malignant and benign disease: hsa-miR-484, hsa-miR-320, 
hsa-let-7a and hsa-miR-125a-5p.
As miRNAs are in large part packaged within 
circulating exosomes, they are protected from degradation 
by circulating enzymes and can be robustly profiled in 
blood samples. Bononi et al. recently showed that several 
circulating miRNAs in serum, namely miR-197-3p, miR-
1281 and miR-32-3p are potential new MPM biomarkers 
[51]. These miRNAs were upregulated in MPM patients 
compared to healthy individuals. Intriguingly, upregulated 
miR-1281 was not only found in MPM patients, but also 
in non-MPM subjects who had been exposed to asbestos 
in the past. Based on these findings, further work is 
necessary to establish the value of circulating miRNAs as 
reproducible MPM biomarkers. 
LncRNAs are non-protein coding RNAs of more 
than 200 nucleotides long. They play an important role 
in regulating transcription and there is rising evidence 
that their aberrant expression plays a role in cancer 
biology [52], while being very specific for the tissue of 
origin. Long non-coding RNAs are reported to serve as 
biomarkers in MPM [53]. Wright et al. demonstrated that 
lncRNA expression tissue profiles allow differentiation 
between malignant mesothelium and benign pleura [53]. 
LncRNAs can also be reliably detected in plasma samples, 
offering the possibility to explore these molecules as 
biomarkers for MPM.
Breath analysis: An alternative for blood 
biomarkers 
The search for new and non-invasive biomarkers is 
currently shifting towards the field of breathomics [54]. 
Analysis of the exhaled breath of an at-risk population can 
provide valuable information on the metabolic status of 
the patient. Breath contains volatile organic compounds 
(VOCs) arising from endogenous biochemical pathways 
or from inhaled/absorbed exogenous sources. The 
concentration of these VOCs usually ranges from the low 
part per billion (ppb) to the part per trillion (ppt) level. 
Changes in the VOC-profile reflect changes in processes 
related to metabolism (host and microbiome-derived), 
inflammation or tumoral development [54]. Therefore, a 
selection of VOCs can potentially be used as a diagnostic 
biomarker to screen for certain diseases such as MPM 
[55]. To date, researchers have mainly focused on lung 
cancer within this research field. Nevertheless, there 
are also a number of studies which investigated the 
potential of breath analysis as diagnostic tool for pleural 
mesothelioma. 
There are different technologies available that are 
well suited for breath analysis [56]. The gold standard is 
gas chromatography-mass spectrometry (GC-MS). This 
technique allows both identification and quantification of 
individual compounds with very high sensitivity, and is 
usually combined with thermal desorption or solid-phase 
micro extraction (SPME). The downside of this method is 
its long time-to-result, relative cost and requirement for 
expert operator staff.
Selected ion flow tube mass spectrometry (SIFT-
MS) and proton transfer reaction mass spectrometry 
(PTR-MS) are both techniques which allow real-time and 
on-line measurements of VOCs in breath [57, 58]. These 
methods are both based on chemical ionization of the 
trace compounds by well-defined reagent ions, resulting 
in product ions that can be detected and quantified, based 
on their mass-to-charge ratio (m/z). The sensitivity of 
SIFT-MS is higher than for PTR-MS, but GC-MS still has 
the highest sensitivity. Furthermore, PTR-MS and SIFT-
MS generate large fragmentation of the compounds in the 
entire sample at once, limiting their use for unsupervised 
biomarker detection. Another analytical technique that can 
be used for breath analysis, is ion mobility spectrometry 
(IMS). This involves the movement of gas-phase ions that 
are exposed to an electric field in a drift tube, where they 
counteract with a drift gas (nitrogen or synthetic air). The 
product ions gain a constant velocity through the influence 
of an electrical field and by collision with the drift gas 
molecules [59]. This velocity depends on the size, mass 
and shape of the concerning product ions. The advantages 
of this technique are speed and user-friendliness, allowing 
low-cost, online sampling. 
Recently, sensor technologies based upon pattern 
recognition like electronic noses (e-noses) have been 
developed allowing a fast and non-invasive analysis 
of exhaled breath. These devices are inspired by the 
mammalian olfactory system and are also known as 
biomimetic cross-reactive sensor arrays [60]. In contrast 
to the abovementioned techniques, an e-nose does 
not allow the identification of individual VOCs as the 
sensors only recognize a bulk of VOCs giving a breath 
signature as output. In principle, a standard e-nose has a 
lower sensitivity and limit of detection compared to other 
mentioned techniques, which is not an issue as such as 
long as the technology allows accurate discrimination 
between certain groups. If, using different methods, 
cancer-specific VOCs can be defined, then an array of 
e-nose sensors can be designed that specifically recognizes 
these cancer-related compounds. With this strategy, the 
specificity of an e-nose will be higher than that of the 
standard, more complex technologies.
Dragonieri et al. investigated whether an e-nose 
would allow to distinguish MPM patients from asbestos-
exposed individuals without MPM and from healthy 
controls [61]. They included 13 subjects in each group. 
Their attempt to separate the breathprints of patients with 
 Oncotarget

MPM from those of individuals with similar professional 
asbestos exposure showed promising results. They were 
also able to differentiate between the MPM patients and 
healthy controls based on their breathprint. 
The diagnostic potential of these breathprints 
has been confirmed by Chapman et al., who correctly 
identified patients with MPM, patients with benign 
asbestos-related diseases and healthy individuals in 88% of 
cases [62]. De Gennaro et al., developed a method based 
on GC-MS in order to determine discriminatory VOCs 
among patients with MPM, individuals with long-term 
occupational exposure to asbestos and healthy controls 
without asbestos exposure [63]. They demonstrated that 
cyclohexane and cyclopentane are the dominant VOCs for 
discriminating between the abovementioned groups. 
The potential of IMS for diagnostic purposes was 
investigated by Cakir et al. Discrimination between 
healthy controls and patients with asbestos-related 
diseases was possible based on a combination of two 
VOCs in the IMS chromatogram representing α-pinene 
and 4-ethyltoluol [64]. Recently, our group published 
the results of the detection of MPM in exhaled breath by 
IMS [65]. In contrast to Cakir et al., we included MPM 
patients and were able to discriminate these patients from 
both healthy non-asbestos exposed individuals as well as 
asymptomatic asbestos-exposed subjects with a sensitivity 
and specificity of respectively 87% and 70%. 
Despite these promising results, conclusions from 
these studies cannot be generalized due to the rather limited 
number of individuals included in each cohort. None of 
these studies have externally validated their findings, which 
is a necessary step towards clinical implementation. In 
addition, further refinements in the reported VOC signatures 
could lead to substantial increases in diagnostic accuracy. 
One way to achieve this goal is to investigate which VOCs 
are originating from the cancer cells themselves rather 
than from the inflamed stromal environment (the latter 
being shared between mesothelioma patients and asbestos-
exposed individuals without evidence of tumor).
Searching for mesothelioma cancer cell-specific 
VOCs
A way to directly home-in on cancer cell-specific 
VOCs, is to analyze the so-called “headspace” air of in 
vitro cell cultures containing only cancer cells of interest. 
Different experimental set-ups have been investigated to 
that end, with most published research focusing on lung 
cancer. Different methods have been used to analyze the 
VOCs in the headspace of different cancer cell lines, lung 
cancer tissue and pleural effusions. The VOCs that have 
been detected, are very divergent among different reports. 
To date, the only study that included a MPM cell 
line, was performed by Gendron et al. They were able to 
differentiate between different cancer cell lines consisting 
of adenocarcinoma, squamous cell carcinoma, and 
mesothelioma using an electronic nose [66]. Distinguishing 
between the studied cancer cell lines, including a MPM cell 
line, and normal cells was possible based on the difference 
in composition of the headspace air over the cells. The 
degree of discrimination between the different samples 
was indicated by the Mahalanobis distances (MD). In most 
cases, the MD between the tumor cell lines and the normal 
controls was greater than 3 which is the threshold indicating 
that the e-nose signatures are significantly discriminative. 
In some cases, the MD was even higher than 5, meaning 
that the e-nose not just distinguishes the tumor cell lines 
from other cell types, but also would allow identification 
of these cell lines. A caveat is that the e-nose platform used 
in these studies is subjected to drift between sampling sets 
which jeopardizes reproducibility.
Supplementary Table 1 gives an comparative 
overview of compounds that were found via both breath 
analysis (subjects) and headspace analysis (in vitro cell 
cultures). While the only data available relates to lung 
cancer, it clearly shows that there is some degree of 
overlap between in vitro and in vivo detected compounds. 
Precisely these “shared” VOCs could serve as superior 
biomarkers for early detection of malignancy. As can be 
seen in Supplementary Table 1, in headspace of cancerous 
cell lines it is mainly the concentration of certain aldehydes 
(acetaldehyde), ketones (2-butanone, cyclohexanon) 
and alkanes that is significantly decreased or increased 
compared to the headspace of non-cancerous cell lines or 
medium only. Conflicting findings have been reported for 
a few compounds mentioned in Supplementary Table 1. 
For hexanal, one study involving breath analysis showed 
an increased concentration for lung cancer, while the 
in vitro results from another study showed a decrease in 
concentration. As for acetone and 2-butanone, most studies 
are concordant (i.e. increased concentration in cancer cell 
lines), but for each of these compounds there is also one 
study with opposite results. 
We plan to perform a similar approach for pleural 
mesothelioma, i.e. comparing the results from breath 
analysis with in vitro studies on different MPM cell 
lines in order to see which VOCs are related to aspecific 
inflammation and which VOCs originate from the 
cancerous cells themselves.
Drawbacks involving breath-based biomarkers
As mentioned, VOCs in breath originate from both 
exogenous and endogenous sources. Nevertheless, only 
endogenous VOCs can be considered as biomarkers. 
The fact that VOCs originate from oxidative stress and 
upregulated metabolism, it could be that it is hard to 
discriminate between different cancer types. The big 
challenge in breath testing is to get a better understanding 
of the biochemical pathways in which cancer-related 
endogenous VOCs are generated in order to know their 
origin. Presently, with an exception of acetone and 
 Oncotarget
53757
www.impactjournals.com/oncotarget
isoprene, little is known about the metabolic processes 
underlying production of VOC-biomarkers. This shows 
the importance of in vitro experiments, which can provide 
us with better insights on this matter. When in vitro 
experiments are performed, the cell culture conditions 
influence the cell culture metabolomics. It will be 
important for future experiments to closely mimic the 
physiological conditions in the body instead of working 
under standard culture conditions. Several studies also 
showed that the VOC profile can differ among different 
cell lines of the same cancer [67–70].
Furthermore, studies have shown that the VOC profile 
in breath shows variability between and within individuals 
[71, 72]. Although studies are contradictive, it seems that 
the important factors influencing the breath profile are 
smoking behavior, body mass index (BMI), gender, age 
and medication use. Hence it is worthwile to take these into 
account when studies involving breath testing are performed. 
However, this is much challenging when it comes to 
correcting for the contribution of the gut microbiome to the 
individual VOC spectrum. An additional layer of complexity 
is generated by the host immune status. Although most 
available data in that subject pertains to inflammatory/innate 
immune responses, less is known about the VOCs generated 
from components of the adaptive immune system. There is 
one report using in vitro experiments revealing that human 
B-cells also generate a distinct VOC profile [73]. Either way, 
it is very likely that the immune system may contribute to 
the VOC profile in breath when the patient is suffering from 
cancer, infection or other diseases. 
Finally, there are also differences in the applied 
techniques for breath analysis, with their own specific 
advantages and drawbacks. Furthermore, there is a lack 
of standardization in analytical technology which makes 
interpretation of results between different studies difficult.
Conclusions and future perspectives
The increasing incidence of malignant pleural 
mesothelioma is not only a problem of the present, but is also 
a challenge for years to come. Asbestos, the main etiological 
agent of MPM, is still being processed in developing regions 
and therefore, its incidence will continue to rise. The early 
detection of malignancy, including MPM, seems very 
important in order to improve survival rates. Because current 
screening tools for MPM generally detect the disease in an 
advanced stage, there is an ongoing search for new biomarkers 
that allow the early detection of MPM. As described in this 
review, many efforts have already been done within this scope, 
but the search continues as there is still no validated ‘gold 
standard’. Ideally, potential biomarkers should be non-invasive, 
robust and easy-to-use. Test-related costs should be minimal 
and time to analytical result should be sufficiently short.
We aim to develop breath analysis as a point-of care 
biomarker test that meets these requirements. Breathomics 
is an increasingly investigated research field showing 
promising results for early stage diagnosis of MPM. 
Rigorous studies on large patient cohorts and appropriate 
controls will determine the clinical validity and utility of 
breathomics in the diagnosis of mesothelioma. Studies 
addressing the accuracy in mesothelioma patients versus 
healthy controls are redundant, as are studies restricted to 
pleural effusions, as the latter are obtained in patients who 
have already a high likelihood of MPM.
President Obama introduced the “National Cancer 
Moonshot” initiative which should accelerate research efforts 
on prevention, (early) diagnosis and treatment of cancer. 
Our search for the ‘ideal’ biomarker in malignant pleural 
mesothelioma fits within the scope of this initiative. Cancer is 
a disease that affects people in every layer of society and we, 
scientists, have the obligation to use our knowledge on human 
health in exploring new ways to improve cancer management. 
Therefore, future studies should focus on the at-risk population, 
consisting of people being professionally exposed to asbestos 
with a latency time of at least 20 years after exposure.
Box 1: General aspects on biomarker 
development
In general, a biomarker gives an indication of the 
biological state of an organism. More specifically, a 
diagnostic biomarker should indicate whether a disease 
is present [74]. In the development of a (diagnostic) 
biomarker, methodological validation is an important 
step towards clinical implementation [75, 76]. The aims 
are to assess the test’s reproducibility, repeatability, 
accuracy and sensitivity/specificity. In the first part 
of biomarker development, an internal validation is 
performed. This involves the inclusion of a test set in 
order to build up a diagnostic model, and subsequent 
validation of the findings using a validation set. In the 
next phase, an external validation should be performed, 
using a separate, prospectively recruited set of test 
subjects. This essential step yields a better picture of 
the robustness of the proposed model [77, 78]. Although 
these validation steps can establish the analytical and 
clinical validity of the test, it is still essential to ascertain 
clinical utility: does early detection of disease effectively 
correlate with better outcome? Can a negative test spare 
subjects from unnecessary and potentially harmful 
invasive diagnostic procedures?
