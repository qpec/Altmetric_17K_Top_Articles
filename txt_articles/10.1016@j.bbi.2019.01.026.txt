Abstract 
Background Common infectious pathogens have been associated with psychiatric disorders, 
self-violence and risk-taking behavior. 
 
Methods This case-control study reviews register data on 81,912 individuals from the Danish 
Blood Donor Study  to identify individuals who have a psychiatric diagnosis (N=2,591), have 
attempted or committed suicide (N=655), or have had traffic accidents (N=2,724). For all 
cases, controls were frequency matched by age and sex, resulting in 11,546 participants.  
Plasma samples were analyzed for immunoglobulin G (IgG) antibodies against Toxoplasma 
gondii and cytomegalovirus (CMV). 
 
Results T. gondii was detected in 25·9% of the population and was associated with 
schizophrenia (odds ratio [OR], 1·47; 95% confidence interval [CI], 1·03–2·09). Accounting 
for temporality, with pathogen exposure preceding outcome, the association was even 
stronger (IRR, 2·78; 95% CI, 1·27–6·09). A very weak association between traffic accident 
and toxoplasmosis (OR, 1·11; 95% CI, 1·00–1·23, p = 0.054) was found. 
CMV was detected in 60·8% of the studied population and was associated with any 
psychiatric disorder (OR, 1·17; 95% CI, 1·06–1·29), but also with a smaller group of 
neurotic, stress-related, and somatoform disorders (OR, 1·27; 95% CI, 1·12–1·44), and with 
attempting or committing suicide (OR, 1·31; 95% CI, 1·10–1·56). Accounting for 
temporality, any psychiatric disorder (IRR, 1·37; 95% CI, 1·08–1·74) and mood disorders 
(IRR, 1·43; 95% CI, 1·01–2·04) were associated with exposure to CMV. No association 
between traffic accident and CMV (OR, 1·06; 95% CI, 0·97–1·17) was found. 
 
Conclusions This large-scale serological study is the first study to examine temporality of 
   
 
4 
pathogen exposure and to provide evidence of a causal relationship between T. gondii and 
schizophrenia, and between CMV and any psychiatric disorder.

1. 
Introduction 
In recent years there has been a growing interest in the influence of infectious agents on 
human behavior and mental disorders. Common infectious pathogens such as Toxoplasma 
gondii (T. gondii) and cytomegalovirus (CMV) have been associated with psychiatric 
disorders, cognitive deficits, suicidal behavior, and traffic accidents (Dickerson et al., 2018, 
2017, 2014b; Flegr et al., 2002; Flegr and Horáček, 2018; Hamdani et al., 2017; Sutterland et 
al., 2015). The nature of these associations remains uncertain, but it is plausible that they 
reflect causality.   
 
T. gondii is a protozoan parasite that causes the disease toxoplasmosis. Most exposed people 
experience a latent (asymptomatic) form of the disease. However, prenatal infection with T. 
gondii may cause abortion as well as a congenital syndrome that includes seizures and severe 
intellectual disability (Nissen et al., 2017). Studies have demonstrated that latent T. gondii 
infection may induce behavioral changes both in animal models and in humans, possibly as 
part of an evolutionary strategy dubbed the ‘parasite manipulation hypothesis’, but the results 
have been inconsistent (Flegr et al., 2011; Poirotte et al., 2016; Worth et al., 2014).  
 
CMV is a common lifelong, latent beta herpes virus infection, and most healthy exposed 
people experience a latent form of the disease, with few or no symptoms. Congenital CMV 
infection may cause visual impairment, hearing loss or cognitive impairment (Dollard et al., 
2007). Several studies have shown that infection with CMV is associated with increased risk 
of psychiatric disorders such as schizophrenia, bipolar disorder, and cognitive deficits 
(Dickerson et al., 2014b; Hamdani et al., 2017). Moreover, CMV may exacerbate existing 
psychiatric pathology through mechanisms including induction of pro-inflammatory 
   
 
6 
cytokines (e.g., interleukin-6 (IL-6) and tumor necrosis factor-α (TNF-??)) or directly via 
interactions with specific illness susceptibility genes (Prossin et al., 2015). 
 
If T. gondii and CMV infections were causally associated with inexpedient behavior or 
psychiatric disorders it could have public health as well as clinical implications, since it could 
offer targets for both prevention and treatment. To this end, it is essential to establish the 
direction of the association between the infectious agents and the behavioral and psychiatric 
outcomes, i.e. the sequence of events. We therefore examined a large cohort of blood donors 
carefully assessed for both T. gondii and CMV infection exposures over time, and for 
behavioral and psychiatric outcomes. 
 
2. Methods  
2.1. 
 Study population 
The Danish Blood Donor Study (DBDS) is an ongoing national large-scale prospective cohort 
of Danish blood donors, previously described (Burgdorf et al., 2017). DBDS was initiated in 
March 2010 as a multicenter, public-health study and biobank (www.dbds.dk) and by 2018 
included more than 110,000 individuals between 18 and 67 years at day of inclusion 
(inclusive). Data collection in DBDS employs existing infrastructure for standardized data 
collection and for handling and storage of blood samples from all Danish blood centers. The 
DBDS biobank contains DNA and EDTA plasma samples, consecutive for all donors 
returning for blood donation after enrolment.  
2.2. 
 Overall design 
We carried out a case-control study in DBDS and a case-control study nested in DBDS to 
account for temporality, i.e., the exposure should precede the outcome of interest. 
   
 
7 
Specifically, we identified all individuals in the DBDS cohort registered with psychiatric 
disorders, suicidal behavior, or traffic accidents (N=5,953). All cases with psychiatric 
disorders (1971-2013), suicidal behavior (1977-2011) and traffic accidents (2008-2012) were 
included. These were frequency matched with suitable controls (N=7,101). For all identified 
individuals, sample immunological assays were used to provide information on past infection 
with T. gondii and CMV. Details follow below. 
 
2.3. 
 Psychiatric diagnoses  
The Danish Psychiatric Central Research Register (Mors et al., 2011) is a nationwide 
computerized register. The register holds information on all admissions to Danish psychiatric 
inpatient facilities since 1969 and to outpatient facilities since 1995. Psychiatric diagnoses are 
coded according to the International Classification of Diseases - 8th Revision (WHO, 1965) 
between 1969 and 1993 and 10th Revision (WHO, 1994) since 1994.  
Cases with any diagnosis of psychiatric disorder (ICD-10: F00-F99 and eq. ICD-8) and 
subgroups of cases, including schizophrenia and related disorders (ICD-10: F20-F29 and eq. 
ICD-8 (Pedersen et al., 2014)), mood disorders (ICD10: F30-F39 and eq. ICD8) and neurotic, 
stress-related, and somatoform disorders (ICD-10: F40-F48 and eq. ICD-8) before the end of 
2013 were obtained. For all participants, we obtained information on parental history of any 
psychiatric diagnosis. 
2.4. 
 Attempting and committing suicide  
The Danish Register of Causes of Death (Juel and Helweg-Larsen, 1999) contains 
information concerning all residents who died in Denmark from 1970 through 2011. In 
Denmark, the legal regulation on death certification states that any case of sudden and 
   
 
8 
unexpected death shall be reported to the police, and the death certificate may only be issued 
after a medico-legal examination. 
The Danish National Patient Register (Lynge et al., 2011) was established in 1977 to 
prospectively record public hospital admissions, and obtained nationwide coverage regarding 
inpatient admissions. From 1995 it was expanded to include outpatient and emergency room 
contacts, and from 2002 it includes private hospitals and private specialty clinics. Diagnoses 
are based on the International Classification of Diseases  8th Revision between 1977 and 
1993, and the International Classification of Diseases –10th Revision from 1994 onward.  
First episode of deliberate self‐violence and suicide were defined by inclusion in the Danish 
National Patient Register (1977-2012), the Psychiatric Central Research Register (1969-2013) 
or the Danish Register of Causes of Death (1970-2011), which has previously been used in 
Danish register studies (Nordentoft, 2011). In this study we restricted the definition criteria to 
episodes registered after the age of 15. 
2.5. 
 Traffic accidents 
Participants who had been involved in a traffic accident in the period 2008 to 2012 were 
identified in the Danish National Patient Register or in the Danish Register of Causes of 
Death.  
Participants registered with accident as a cause of contact in the Danish National Patient 
Register were defined as a case if they had one or more cause of contact that indicated 
involvement in a traffic accident (diagnosis ICD-10: Z041, accident-code: EUK0, EUG0 plus 
EUA0 or EUA2 or EUHD01). Cases registered as a pedestrian (EUP1) or passenger 
(EUHD02, EUT2-EUT5) were excluded. Participants with transport accidents (ICD-10: V01-
V99) as an underlying cause of death from the Danish Register of Causes of Death were also 
defined as cases.  
   
 
9 
2.6. 
 Controls 
Frequency matched controls were selected among the 81,912 DBDS participants and matched 
for age (age at time of blood sampling in completed years) and sex for the 5,953 cases. For 
each sex and age matched group, 20% more controls than cases were chosen (N = 7,101, of 
whom 554 were also a case) giving a total number of 12,500 cases and controls. To allow 
using controls between different outcomes, controls were not conditioned to be healthy. This 
was handled in the specific analyses for each outcome. 
 
2.7. 
 Immunological assays 
Plasma samples from blood donations were initially collected in 5 ml plasma preparation 
tubes (K2EDTA/Gel), centrifuged and frozen within 6 hours after blood collection. For this 
study all 81,912 plasma samples were thawed and transferred to Thermo Scientific Matrix 
tubes with 2D Codes on the bottom, before selection of cases and controls.  
The 12,500 selected plasma samples for cases and controls were randomized into three 
batches and transferred to the Stanley Neurovirology Laboratory for analysis of specific 
enzyme-based immunoassays for immunoglobulin (IgG) class antibodies against T. gondii 
and CMV, previously described (Dickerson et al., 2003). The raw IgG antibody titer values 
were standardized across plates and the distribution of this standardized z-score was fitted 
with two normal distributions to determine the cut-off value for each batch and each 
infectious agent (Supplemental Figures 1 and 2). The cut-off was determined to match the 
area under the tails in the two normal distributions. If the individual had a value above this 
cut-off, it was considered that the person had been exposed to the infectious agent.  
 
2.8. 
 Statistical methods  
   
 
10 
After sample-analysis and quality control, statistical analysis was conducted on 11,546 cases 
and controls.  
A conditional logistic regression model was used to analyze the associations between T. 
gondii and CMV and the risk of psychiatric disorders, suicidal behavior, and traffic accidents 
forming strata for frequency matched sets. By design, we controlled for sex and age at time of 
blood sampling, therefore age and sex are not directly included in the conditional logistic 
regression. Additionally, we conducted an analysis where toxoplasmosis and CMV were 
mutually adjusted, and all analyses were adjusted for parental history of psychiatric disorder 
before time of blood collection, as previously described (Pedersen et al., 2011). Odds ratios 
(ORs) and 95% likelihood ratio confidence intervals (95% CIs) were calculated. A two-sided 
P value of less than 0·05 was considered to be statistically significant. Statistical analyses 
were performed using the PHREG procedure in SAS 9·3 (SAS Institute, Cary, North 
Carolina). We also calculated the batch specific estimates (Supplemental Figures 3 and 4).  
The nested case-control study was conducted to account for temporality, i.e., the exposure 
should precede the outcome of interest to fulfill Hills viewpoints of causality (Rothman et al., 
2008). For each outcome of interest, we included only individuals with onset after the date of 
blood sample collection and conducted conditional logistic regression for these cases and their 
time-, age- and sex-matched controls.  The estimates thus obtained are informative for the risk 
of developing the outcomes of interest following exposure to T. gondii or CMV i.e., incidence 
rate ratios (Pearce, 1993; Vandenbroucke and Pearce, 2012).  
 
2.9. 
 Ethics  
The Ethics Committee of Central Denmark (M-20090237) and The Danish Data Protection 
Agency (2007-58-0015) have previously approved the study. The Danish Data Protection 
Agency approved the transport and analysis of plasma samples to the Stanley Neurovirology 
   
 
11 
Laboratory. The National Board of Health approved the use of registry data. Data will be kept 
confidential under the law concerning processing of personal data. Written informed consent 
was obtained from all participants.

3. Results 
Register data on 81,912 individuals were reviewed to find individuals who had been 
diagnosed with psychiatric disorders, had attempted or committed suicide, and/or had been 
involved in traffic accidents, resulting in a total of 12,500 cases and controls. After sample 
analysis and quality control, statistical analysis was conducted on 11,546 cases and controls, 
see distribution of cases and controls (non-exclusive) in Table 1. A total of 5,492 individuals 
(2,807 women) were registered with a psychiatric disorder, suicide or suicide attempt, or 
traffic accident. Overall, 2,591 individuals (1,314 women) were registered in the Danish 
Psychiatric Central Research Register with a psychiatric diagnosis, 655 (377 women) had 
attempted or committed suicide, and 2,724 individuals (1,233 women) had been involved in a 
traffic accident. The average age at blood donation was 37.4 years in the study population; 
age distribution is shown in Supplemental Figure 5. 
 
3.1. Infection with T. gondii and CMV  
Of the 11,546 studied individuals, 2,990 and 7,020 individuals, respectively, tested positive 
for IgG class antibodies against T. gondii (25·9%) or CMV (60·8%). For a more detailed 
overview of the number of infected/non-infected cases and controls for each health outcome, 
see Supplemental Table 1. 
We found that individuals with a T. gondii infection had increased odds of being diagnosed 
with schizophrenia disorders compared to those without infection (OR, 1·47; 95% CI, 1·03–
2·09) (Table 1). The association was even stronger when accounting for temporality and 
considering only the 28 cases who were diagnosed with a schizophrenia disorder after the date 
of blood collection (IRR, 2·78; 95% CI, 1·27–6·09) (Table 1). A very weak association 
between toxoplasmosis and involvement in traffic accidents was observed in 9,018 
individuals (OR, 1·11; 95% CI, 1·00–1·23) also when including only individuals with traffic 
   
 
13 
accident after blood donation (IRR, 1·18; 95% CI, 0·99–1·41) (Table 1). Besides 
schizophrenia, T. gondii infection was not statistically significantly associated with any other 
psychiatric disorder, whether overall (OR, 1·03; 95% CI, 0·93–1·15), or more specifically, 
i.e. mood disorders (OR, 0·89; 95% CI, 0·73–1·07), neurotic, stress-related, and somatoform 
disorders (OR, 1·05; 95% CI, 0·92–1·21), or attempting or committing suicide (OR, 1·13; 
95% CI, 0·94–1·36) (Table 1).  
 
CMV infection was associated with increased risk of: any psychiatric disorder (OR, 1·17; 
95% CI, 1·06–1·29), neurotic, stress-related and somatoform disorders (OR, 1·27; 95% CI, 
1·12–1·44) and attempting or committing suicide (OR, 1·31; 95% CI, 1·10–1·56) (Table 1). 
Considering only cases with an outcome after the date of blood donation, CMV infection was 
still statistically significantly associated with any psychiatric disorder (IRR, 1·37; 95% CI, 
1·08–1·74) but not with attempting or committing suicide (IRR, 1·18; 95% CI, 0·50–2·82). In 
addition, CMV infection was found only to be associated with mood disorders (IRR, 1·43; 
95% CI, 1·01–2·04) after excluding individuals with onset pre-dating blood sample collection 
(Table 1). CMV infection was not statistically significantly associated with schizophrenia and 
related disorders (OR, 1·25; 95% CI, 0·89–1·77) or with traffic accidents (OR, 1·06; 95% CI, 
0·97–117) (Table 1). Mutual adjustment of CMV and toxoplasmosis did not change the 
overall findings (Supplemental Table 2).

4. Discussion  
This largest to date serological study provides evidence that exposure to T. gondii might be a 
contributing causal factor for developing schizophrenia and that exposure to CMV might be a 
contributing causal factor for developing serious psychiatric disorders.  
Research suggests that changes in dopamine levels are involved in the pathogenesis of 
toxoplasmosis-associated behavior changes in humans. These include prolongation of 
reaction time, decreased long-term concentration, decreased cognition and specific changes in 
neurodegenerative- and psychiatric disorders (Flegr et al., 2003).  
The Toxoplasma genome carries two genes encoding dopamine-synthesizing enzymes 
(tyrosine hydroxylase) (Gaskell et al., 2009; Henriquez et al., 2009). Dopamine is produced 
and secreted in large amounts in Toxoplasma cysts in the brain tissue of infected rodents 
(Martin et al., 2015; Prandovszky et al., 2011) and most likely in humans as well (Flegr et al., 
2003; Henriquez et al., 2009; McConkey et al., 2013; Skallová et al., 2005). It has been 
shown that latent (but not acute) T. gondii infection in mice elevates the local brain dopamine 
concentrations, as observed in individuals with schizophrenia (Eyles et al., 2012; Henriquez et 
al., 2009). This increased dopamine level may be responsible for toxoplasmosis-associated 
behavior changes. 
Human cognition may be affected by exposure to T. gondii, as severe congenital 
toxoplasmosis can lead to mental retardation (Nissen et al., 2017). Even among “unaffected” 
children with congenital toxoplasmosis, high maternal antibody titres during pregnancy are 
associated with delayed mental development in their first year and an increased risk of having 
an IQ less than 70 at 7 years (Sever et al., 1988). Human cognition and behavior may also be 
affected by postnatal T. gondii infection. In schoolchildren, toxoplasma seropositivity has 
   
 
15 
been associated with lower mathematics (Ferreira et al., 2013) and reading skills but also 
poorer memory capacity (A. Mendy et al., 2015). Several studies have also shown a negative  
effect of T. gondii on cognition in adults and the elderly (Dickerson et al., 2014a; Gajewski et 
al., 2014; Hamdani et al., 2017; Angelico Mendy et al., 2015; Nimgaonkar et al., 2016; 
Wyman et al., 2017).  
Infections have been associated with cognitive and behavior changes in humans. Prenatal 
exposure to a range of infections and inflammatory responses may be associated with 
increased risk of adult schizophrenia (Khandaker et al., 2013). Infections in early childhood 
have been found to have negative effects on human cognition and increased risk of 
nonaffective psychosis. 
 (Khandaker et al., 2018).  
The immunological reaction to a parasite infestation may disrupt tryptophan metabolism, as 
parasite-infected cells secrete large amounts of kynurenic acid (KYNA) via indoleamine-2,3-
dioxygenase (IDO)-mediated tryptophan degradation (Henriquez et al., 2009; McConkey et 
al., 2013). Latent T. gondii infection leads to the production of the rate-limiting enzyme IDO 
and tryptophan dioxygenase (TDO) in astrocytes (Campbell et al., 2014; Henriquez et al., 
2009; McConkey et al., 2013; Nagineni et al., 1996). This leads to decreased levels of 
tryptophan, necessary for the growth and replication of T. gondii, but moreover, leads to the 
production of some harmful metabolites such as KYNA. Tryptophan is degraded by IDO to 
kynurenine, which is either metabolized to KYNA, an antagonist of the glutamate N-methyl-
D-aspartate (NMDA) and nicotinic receptors (Campbell et al., 2014; Henriquez et al., 2009; 
Kessler et al., 1989)  or hydroxylated to quinolinate, a potent NMDA neurotoxic agent (El-
Defrawy et al., 1986). High levels of KYNA are found in the cerebrospinal fluid of 
schizophrenic individuals, and may plausibly cause cognitive disorders in schizophrenia 
(Henriquez et al., 2009). Tryptophan is also the essential precursor of serotonin, which is 
   
 
16 
involved in depressive disorders. Hence, both dopaminergic and glutamatergic systems are 
affected by T. gondii and could represent the mediating factors between toxoplasmosis and 
psychiatric disease.  
A causal relationship between serological evidence of exposure to Toxoplasma and 
psychiatric disorders has been well studied in individuals with schizophrenia (Flegr and 
Horáček, 2018; Hamdani et al., 2017; Sutterland et al., 2015; Torrey et al., 2012, 2007). We 
found a statistically significant association between serological evidence of exposure to 
Toxoplasma and schizophrenia or related disorders, compared to controls. An even stronger 
statistically significant association was observed between serological evidence of exposure to 
Toxoplasma and schizophrenia after excluding participants whose diagnosis preceded blood 
sample collection. This corroborates that Toxoplasma has a positive effect on the rate of 
schizophrenia and that T. gondii infection might be a contributing causal factor for 
schizophrenia. Similarly, a meta-analysis including all available studies analyzing the 
association between T. gondii infection and schizophrenia reported an increased odds ratio of 
2·73 (Torrey et al., 2007). This level of association exceeds both the genetic and most other 
environmental risk factors for schizophrenia to date (Torrey et al., 2012), supporting the close 
relation between T. gondii infection and schizophrenia.  
It has been found that individuals with higher titers of IgG class antibodies on T. gondii often 
show more severe symptoms of psychosis and a correlation between toxoplasmosis and 
increased mortality in schizophrenic patients has been observed (Dickerson et al., 2007; 
Torrey et al., 2007). Interestingly, many anti-psychotic drugs commonly used in the treatment 
of schizophrenic patients have anti-T. gondii activity and may inhibit the replication and 
invasion of T. gondii in infected individuals (Gutiérrez-Fernández et al., 2015). It has been 
shown that schizophrenic patients treated with anti-psychotic drugs have lower levels of 
antibodies to T. gondii compared to untreated schizophrenic patients (Leweke et al., 2004). 
   
 
17 
One could argue that the effect of anti-psychotic drugs in schizophrenic patients may be partly 
due to the inhibition of T. gondii activity. 
Toxoplasma-associated behavior changes could result in decreased concentration and 
prolonged reaction time, which could increase the risk of traffic accidents. We found a very 
weak statistical association between T. gondii infection and risk of traffic accidents. Previous 
studies have found a 2 to 4 times higher risk of traffic accidents in individuals with T. gondii 
infection compared to non-infected individuals (Flegr et al., 2002; Flegr and Dama, 2014; 
Stepanova et al., 2017). Interesting, the only existing prospective cohort study on traffic 
accidents and toxoplasmosis found a significant association between traffic accidents and 
toxoplasmosis only in RhD-negative individuals, and not in RhD-positive individuals or in the 
non-sorted population (Flegr et al., 2009). The difference in RhD status could also apply to 
our study and may explain why we only found a very weak association between 
toxoplasmosis and traffic accidents. A recent systematic review and meta-analysis concluded 
that exposure to T. gondii significantly increases the risk of having traffic accidents 
(Gohardehi et al., 2018) which our results also supports. In addition, T. gondii infected 
individuals have been found also to have an increased risk of workplace accidents (perhaps 
due to decreased concentration and prolonged reaction times) (Alvarado-Esquivel et al., 2012) 
and of starting their own business (Johnson et al., 2018), but not of increased financial risk-
taking (Lanchava et al., 2015). 
Besides T. gondii infection, herpesvirus, such as CMV, infection has also been associated 
with psychiatric disorders, schizophrenia, mood disorders, decreased cognitive functioning, 
and suicide in seriously mentally ill individuals (Dickerson et al., 2017, 2014b; Hamdani et 
al., 2017; Prossin et al., 2015). Infections like CMV may cause alterations in the immune 
inflammatory cascades and have an impact on brain function through neuroinflammation 
   
 
18 
(Tanaka et al., 2017). 
In our study, CMV was statistically significantly associated with having any psychiatric 
disorder. An even stronger association was observed when including only individuals 
diagnosed after blood collection. CMV was more strongly associated with a more selected 
group of neurotic, stress-related, and somatoform disorders. This group might drive the 
observed effect in any psychiatric disorder, and a post hoc analysis showed that CMV 
infection had no impact on the risk of any psychiatry excluding F40-F48 (OR=1·06, 95% CI 
0·94-1·21, IRR=1·41, 95%CI 0·99-2·00). Studies have showed that higher CMV-IgG levels 
are associated with increased anxiety, depression, vital exhaustion (lack of energy, increased 
irritability, and feelings of demoralization) and decreased SF-12 mental health (Phillips et al., 
2008; Rector et al., 2014; Trzonkowski et al., 2004). Higher CMV-IgG levels reflect poorer 
immune control and reactivation of the virus (Glaser and Kiecolt-Glaser, 1994; Kuo et al., 
2008; van Zanten et al., 1995), which may be triggered by psychological stress, representing a 
potential mechanism linking stress and immunity (Bosch et al., 2013). 
 
Prossin et al. also found that a higher IgG concentration against CMV was associated with 
elevated mood states in bipolar disorders compared to healthy controls. In addition, CMV IgG 
was higher in individuals with bipolar disorder with elevated moods but not different in 
depressed moods when compared with euthymic bipolar disorder individuals (Prossin et al., 
2015). We found a statistically significant association between CMV and mood disorder, but 
only in individuals diagnosed after the date of blood collection. In our analysis, we combined 
all diagnoses of mood disorders (ICD-10: F30-F39) into one category, whereas Prossin et al. 
focused only on bipolar disorder (ICD-10: F30-31) (Prossin et al., 2015). Our analysis was 
based on a more diverse group of mood disorders and is not suitable for demonstration of a 
statistically significant association between CMV and a specific mood disorder, such as 
   
 
19 
bipolar disorder, due to the small numbers of cases (N = 57). 
Previous studies have reported an association between inflammatory processes, such as 
infectious agents, and suicide. We found that CMV infection was statistically significantly 
associated with attempting or committing suicide. Taking only suicide or suicide attempts 
after blood donation into account, no association was observed, which might be due to the 
small number of individuals with suicide or suicide attempts after blood collection. Only two 
studies to date have addressed the association between CMV and suicide, and found an 
association between CMV and suicide attempts in individuals with serious mental illness 
(Dickerson et al., 2018, 2017). The observed association between CMV and suicide attempt 
may be due to the direct effect of the microorganisms altering the level of dopamine and other 
neurotransmitters, or due to the immune response altering the activity of toll-like receptors in 
response to CMV, which has also been shown to be altered in brains of individuals with 
completed suicide attempts (Pandey et al., 2014). 
The effect of coinfection with T. gondii and CMV and the association with psychiatric 
disorders, suicidal behavior or traffic accidents did not influence the overall results.  
Our study has several strengths. This case-control study is the largest serological study to date 
of T. gondii and CMV infection in relation to psychiatric disorders, self-violence and risk-
taking behavior in a nation-wide population. Another strength of this study was that we 
accounted for temporality in the nested case-control study, i.e., the pathogen exposure should 
precede the outcome of interest to show possible causality. A limitation of this study was that 
we did not control for socio-economic factors, which may influence the probability of 
pathogen infection, development of psychiatric disorders, suicidal behavior, or involvement in 
traffic accidents. A study of the socio-demographic characteristics of the DBDS population 
showed that the middle to high income groups, but not the highest income group, had fourfold 
   
 
20 
higher donor prevalence than the lowest income group (6.7% compared to 1.7%) and that 
social marginalization, as indicated by low income and being a male living without a woman, 
was associated with lower prevalence of blood donation (Burgdorf et al., 2017). We cannot 
rule out that socio-economic factors could potentially account for part or all of the observed 
causaleffect. The link between family history of psychiatric disorder and psychiatric disorders 
or suicidal behavior is well established (Dean et al., 2010). However, adjusting for parental 
history of psychiatric disorders did not influence the overall results. In this study, the 
prevalence of any psychiatric disorders  was lower than the national lifetime risk of mental 
disorders (Pedersen et al., 2014). This may be due to the fact that the blood donor population 
is a highly selected population who are healthier than the general population, and since older 
blood donors are a highly selected group of individuals (the healthy donor effect), the 
generalizability to other settings may be limited.  
In conclusion, our study finds that T. gondii infection might be a contributing causal factor for 
schizophrenia. Moreover, T. gondii infection was borderline significantly associated with 
traffic accidents. CMV infection may be a risk factor for developing any psychiatric disorder, 
especially neurotic, stress-related, and somatoform disorders, or for experiencing self-
violence in the form of attempting or committing suicide. Although we did not control for 
socio-economic factors, which may have an effect on health outcome, we were able to 
account for temporality of pathogen exposure. Our findings support the growing scientific 
evidence linking pathogenic infection with serious psychiatric disorders. Routinely screening 
for T. gondii and CMV in populations with psychiatric disorders may identify novel 
stratification groups, which can be used to target treatment e.g. in combination with analysis 
of genetic risk factors. Likewise, targeting T. gondii or CMV infections can provide novel 
therapeutic approaches as well as potential biomarkers to identify individuals at increased 
risk. A detailed understanding of the origin, mechanisms and outcomes of these pathogenic 
   
 
21 
infections in relation to psychiatric disorders, self-violence and risk-taking behavior is 
necessary in order to improve detection and treatment.

Adjusted for sex and age due to design and parental history of psychiatric disorder. 
‘bold’ indicates a likelihood ratio based 95% p-value < 0·05 
 ‘*’ We accounted for temporality by excluding individuals with outcome of interest before 
the date of blood sample collection, i.e. past infection with T. gondii and CMV should 
precede the outcome of interest, estimating incidence rate ratios.

Highlights 
 T. gondii infection might be a contributing causal factor for schizophrenia 
 CMV infection might be a contributing causal factor for any psychiatric disorder 
 CMV infection was associated with attempting or committing suicide
