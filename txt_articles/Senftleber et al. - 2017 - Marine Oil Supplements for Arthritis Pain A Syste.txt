Abstract: Arthritis patients often take fish oil supplements to alleviate symptoms, but limited
evidence exists regarding their efficacy. The objective was to evaluate whether marine oil supplements
reduce pain and/or improve other clinical outcomes in patients with arthritis. Six databases were
searched systematically (24 February 2015). We included randomized trials of oral supplements of all
marine oils compared with a control in arthritis patients. The internal validity was assessed using the
Cochrane Risk of Bias tool and heterogeneity was explored using restricted maximum of likelihood
(REML)-based meta-regression analysis. Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development
and Evaluation (GRADE) was used to rate the overall quality of the evidence. Forty-two trials
were included; 30 trials reported complete data on pain. The standardized mean difference (SMD)
suggested a favorable effect (−0.24; 95% confidence interval, CI, −0.42 to −0.07; heterogeneity,
I2 = 63%. A significant effect was found in patients with rheumatoid arthritis (22 trials; −0.21; 95% CI,
−0.42 to −0.004) and other or mixed diagnoses (3 trials; −0.63; 95% CI, −1.20 to −0.06), but not
in osteoarthritis patients (5 trials; −0.17; 95% CI, −0.57–0.24). The evidence for using marine oil to
alleviate pain in arthritis patients was overall of low quality, but of moderate quality in rheumatoid
arthritis patients.

1. Introduction
Arthritis is a musculoskeletal disorder, resulting in joint pain, swelling, stiffness and
restricted movement [1,2]. In the period 2010–2012, 22.7% of American adults reported having
medically-diagnosed arthritis [3]. The two most common types of arthritis are rheumatoid arthritis
(RA) and osteoarthritis (OA). Osteoarthritis is a heterogeneous, degenerative disease exhibiting
inflammatory components, associated with multiple risk factors [4]. In contrast, RA is an autoimmune
disease involving higher levels of synovitis (joint inflammation) than OA [2,4]. The extent of synovitis

has been shown to be associated with pain severity [5,6]. Arthritis patients consider pain the most
hampering symptom [7], and the use of nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) is substantial
across arthritis diagnoses [8,9]. However, NSAIDs are known to cause serious gastrointestinal and
occasionally cardiovascular adverse effects [10,11], prompting the search for alternative treatments.
Marine oil is thought to have an analgesic effect in arthritis as a likely consequence of its
high content of docosahexaenoic acid (DHA; 22:6 n-3) and eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA; 20:5 n-3).
Arachidonic acid (AA; 20:4 n-6), as well as DHA and EPA, are used in the production of lipid mediators
(e.g., eicosanoids), which are involved (among other functions) in the regulation of inflammation.
However, the mediators produced from DHA and EPA shift the balance toward resolution [12]. Thus,
supplementation with EPA- and DHA-rich oil could exert an anti-inflammatory effect [13], making it a
possible treatment for arthritis pain.
Four meta-analyses have compared fish oil or n-3 polyunsaturated fatty acid (PUFA) supplements
with control treatment in patients with musculoskeletal complaints [14–17]. Three meta-analyses
concluded that such supplements were effective [14–16], whereas the fourth review did not find any
effect [17], likely because of different inclusion criteria. In contrast to the previous meta-analyses, our
review included a comprehensive search strategy and assessment of the risk of bias and the quality of
evidence. Vegetable oils were not included, as these provide α-linolenic acid (ALA; 18:3 n-3), from
which only marginal amounts of EPA and DHA can be produced in the human body [18,19].
A previous US survey suggested that approximately 90% of arthritis patients have used, or were
using, complementary therapies [20]. Therefore, consumers and health care practitioners need to know
whether oral marine oil can reduce arthritis pain.
The aim of this systematic review was to evaluate the effect of marine oil across a broad range
of arthritic diseases. Our primary outcome was pain. Secondary outcomes were physical function,
inflammation, number of completers (tolerance), withdrawals due to adverse events, and number
of serious adverse events (SAEs). Our use of the term “marine oil” refers to all oils of marine origin
(e.g., oil from whole fish, seals, and mussels).
2. Materials
2.1. Protocol
Study selection, assessment of eligibility criteria, data extraction, and statistical analyses were
performed based on a predefined protocol registered on PROSPERO (CRD42015016817) following the
guidelines from EQUATOR [21] on systematic reviews (PRISMA statement [22]).
2.2. Data Sources and Searches
The search was conducted on 24 February 2015 in Medical Literature Analysis and
Retrieval System Online (MEDLINE), the Cochrane Library, Excerpta Medica Database (EMBASE),
ClinicalTrials.gov, and the World Health Organization International Clinical Trial Registry Platform
portal (ICTRP) as recommended by the Cochrane Musculoskeletal Group [23], and in the Web of Science
(search strategies are available in Table S1). Reference lists from relevant publications were screened.
The initial screening of the records was done by two reviewers (N.K.S. and S.M.N.), and the subsequent
assessment on full texts was done independently by the same two reviewers. Disagreements were
resolved by consensus or by consulting another reviewer (R.C. or H.B.).
2.3. Study Selection
Eligible studies were all randomized controlled trials comparing all types of marine oil
supplements (i.e., oils of marine origin such as oil from whole fish, seals, or mussels) with a
control treatment applying an add-on design in patients diagnosed with any type of arthritis for
a minimum duration of two weeks. No restrictions were applied on age or gender of the participants,
dosage, or publication date. Reporting the outcomes of interest was not a criterion for entering the
 Nutrients 2017, 9, 42

systematic review. However, trials included in the main meta-analysis for each outcome had to
present complete data (i.e., quantitative data or comprehensive figures), allowing data extraction.
Reports with incomplete data for the outcomes of interest were included in a sensitivity analysis
using null imputations. Reports had to have at least an abstract written in English, Danish, Swedish,
or Norwegian.
2.4. Data Extraction and Quality Assessment
The preferred time point of measurements was the last day of the intervention or as late as possible
when the participants were still receiving the intervention. According to the guidance document
provided by the Cochrane Musculoskeletal Group (aligned with Outcome Measures in Rheumatology
[OMERACT]), there is currently no consensus on a generic core outcome measurement instrument set
that would apply across all musculoskeletal conditions [23]. However, pain remains a construct of
major importance to all (rheumatology) stakeholders (e.g., patients and physicians) [24]. Thus for the
purpose of this review we considered pain the primary outcome [25]. For the function construct, we
used the most appropriate functional tests (e.g., grip strength was preferred for measuring function
in RA, and a walk test was preferred for measuring function in hip or knee OA). We preferred
the most commonly used measures of inflammation (e.g., C-reactive protein, CRP, was preferred
over erythrocyte sedimentation rate). In case of doubt, we used the outcome chosen by a blinded
rheumatologist (H.B.). Authors were contacted in order to obtain data when it was not extractable.
Trials with low internal validity may distort the results from meta-analyses [26], so trials were
assessed using the Cochrane Risk of Bias tool [27]. There is evidence that statistically significant
outcomes have higher odds of being fully reported [28]; therefore, outcome-reporting bias was assessed
using the tool developed by Dwan et al. [29]. Two reviewers (N.K.S. and S.M.N.) independently
extracted data and assessed risk of bias. In case of disagreement, consensus was reached by discussion
or by consulting a third reviewer (R.C. or S.T.).
2.5. Data Synthesis and Analysis
Due to different ways of measuring pain, physical function, and inflammation, treatment effect
sizes for each of the studies were expressed as standardized mean differences (SMDs) by dividing the
difference in mean values by the pooled standard deviation (SD) for the given outcome. A correction
was applied by default by calculating Hedges’s g [30] and the variance (SE2) was calculated based
on the SMD and number of patients in each group [31]. For trials with more than one intervention
group, the number of patients in the control group was divided by the number of comparisons, hence
avoiding double counting of patients and increasing the standard errors, resulting in more correct
estimates. Mean differences at follow-up were used when differences in change from baseline were
not available. A negative SMD for pain and inflammation indicates a beneficial (reducing) effect of
the intervention, where a positive SMD for physical function indicates a beneficial (increasing) effect.
Risk ratios (RRs) were calculated for tolerance, withdrawals due to adverse events, and number of
SAEs [23]. The overall SMDs were transformed into a measure that is easier to interpret [23]; the
SMD for pain was transformed into average improvement in percentage compared to control [32],
assuming an average for pain of 60 mm on a 100-mm visual analog scale (VAS) with an SD of 20 mm
based on a cohort of arthritis patients [33]. For inflammation, a baseline value of 3.8 mg/dL CRP
and an SD of 5.9 mg/dL were assumed (equal to the mean baseline value and SD, respectively, of the
included studies).
Heterogeneity was investigated using forest plots and the heterogeneity (I2) statistic [34,35].
Random-effects models, based on restricted maximum of likelihood (REML), were used as default
option, whereas fixed-effect models were applied as sensitivity analysis.
Sensitivity analyses were conducted by including trials with high risk of outcome-reporting bias
and incomplete data on the outcomes of interest by using null imputation, based on the assumption
that they did not find any effect. This was done by imputing the value, 0, for the SMDs, and calculating
 Nutrients 2017, 9, 42
4 of 21
the confidence intervals from the SE2 as usual, i.e., based on the SMD and number of patients in each
group [36]. The risk of small-study (e.g., publication) bias across studies was assessed using funnel
plots as well as a test for funnel plot asymmetry [37]. Univariate REML-based meta-regression analyses
on pain were used to assess the effect of each risk of bias domain and funding source. Analyses were
performed using R Software (version 3.2.0) [38].
GRADE (Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development and Evaluation) was used to
rate the overall quality of the evidence based on the assessed risk of bias, publication bias, imprecision,
inconsistency, indirectness, and to some degree interpreted this with the apparent magnitude of effect
as well [39]. The GRADE ratings reflect the confidence in the results.
2.6. Additional Analyses
In order to investigate possible sources of heterogeneity, additional analyses of pain were
performed, stratifying the available trials according to trial characteristics (e.g., type of diagnosis)
using univariate REML-based meta-regression. Furthermore, a limited number of post hoc analyses
were carried out, stratifying for the type of marine oil for pain, and for trial characteristics and risk of
bias domains for function and inflammation.
3. Results
3.1. Study Selection
The search strategy identified 3389 records (Figure 1). Of these, 3212 were excluded because they
did not meet the inclusion criteria, and the subsequent full-text assessment resulted in 63 records
describing 53 trials eligible for the systematic review. Searching the trial registries ClinicalTrials.gov
and the World Health Organization International Clinical Trial Registry Platform portal (ICTRP)
contributed an additional nine unique trials for the systematic review; however, none of these trials
were published, and no resulting data could be obtained from author contact so they could not
be included in the meta-analysis. Review of reference lists of relevant publications identified three
potentially relevant trials; one was included [40], and two could not be retrieved [41,42]. In total,
78 records describing 65 trials met the inclusion criteria for the systematic review; of these, 51 records
describing 42 trials [40,43–92] were eligible for inclusion in the meta-analyses (reference lists are
provided in Section S1). Reasons for exclusion are stated in Figure 1 (reference lists are provided
in Sections S2 and S3). One trial was ongoing at the time of publication [93], and we received no
answer after contacting the author. Authors of 20 trials were contacted for additional information;
four [46,72,89,90] provided additional information and one [75] provided additional data.
3.2. Study Characteristics
Study characteristics of the 42 trials included in the analyses are presented in Table 1. The trials
used treatment durations from 2 weeks to 18 months, with doses of EPA from 0.013 to 4.050 g/day, and
doses of DHA from 0.010 to 2.700 g/day. Most trials used marine oil from whole fish, but some used
cod liver oil, mussel extracts, seal oil, and krill oil. Thirty-two trials examined RA, 6 trials examined
OA, and 4 trials examined other/mixed types of arthritis (juvenile arthritis, number of trials: k = 1;
polyarticular psoriatic arthritis, k = 1; mixed diagnoses of RA and/or OA, k = 1; mixed diagnoses of RA
or psoriatic arthritis, k = 1). The trials included 2751 patients with a mean age of 53.8 years (range of
mean age of 10–68 years); mean disease duration was 9.7 years (range 2.3–19.0 years). Of the 30 trials
with complete data on pain, 25 trials included a patient-reported outcome, and the remaining trials
reported tender joint count (k = 2), Ritchie articular index (k = 1), and NSAID consumption (k = 2)
(Table S2).

3.3. Risk of Bias in Included Studies
No trials were judged as having low risk of bias in all nine domains (see Figure 2, bias assessment
table, and outcome matrix in Table S3 and S4). Thirteen trials were judged as having high risk of pain
outcome-reporting bias, 15 trials were judged to be at high risk of function outcome-reporting bias,
and 18 trials were judged to be at high risk of inflammation outcome-reporting bias.

(1998) [49], since only the abstract was available in English, and the rest of the article was not in 
English. Therefore, it was not considered appropriate to assess outcome reporting bias based only on 
the abstract of a full article. 
3.4. Primary Outcome: Pain 
Thirty trials presented complete data and were included in the meta‐analysis on pain. The 
overall effect estimate corresponded to an SMD of −0.24 (95% confidence interval, CI, −0.42 to −0.07, 
p = 0.007), thus indicating a statistically significant pain reducing effect of marine oil (Figure 3). This 
result translates into an improvement of 8% on a VAS scale. However, not all studies suggested a 
beneficial effect of marine oil; hence, the effects were highly heterogeneous across studies (I2 = 63%) 
with a wide prediction interval for the overall effect estimate (−1.05–0.57).

Figure 3. Forest plot of the effect size for marine oil interventions on pain. Weights are shown for both 
a random‐effects model (“W(random)”) and a fixed‐effects model (“W(fixed)”). 95% CI: 95% 
confidence interval; MO: marine oil; SMD: standardized mean differences. Note that the use of the 
term MO refers to all oils of marine origin (e.g., oil from whole fish and mussel oil). 
Meta‐regression analyses (Table 2), showed that a statistically significant amount of the 
heterogeneity could be explained by type of diagnosis (p = 0.024), supplementation type (p = 0.009), 
dosage of EPA plus DHA (p = 0.016), and ratio of EPA/DHA (p = 0.031), but not by type of control (p 
= 0.051) or duration (p = 0.074). There was a significant effect in patients with RA (22 trials; SMD −0.21; 
95% CI, −0.42 to −0.00) and other/mixed diagnoses (3 trials; SMD −0.63; 95% CI, −1.20 to −0.06), but no 
effect in patients with OA (5 trials; SMD −0.17; 95% CI, −0.57–0.24). All bias domains, except blinding 
of personnel and blinding of outcome assessors, could also explain a significant amount of the 
heterogeneity. Post hoc meta‐regression analyses for RA separately are provided in Table S5. 
A significant positive association was found between SMD and total dose of EPA and DHA 
(slope β, 0.13 (g/day)−1, 95% CI, 0.04–0.22, p = 0.006), indicating less effect at higher dose, but there 
was no duration‐response relationship (p = 0.568). Plots of the meta‐regression analyses are provided 
in Figure S1. 
A post hoc meta‐regression analysis was performed exploring differences among the types of 
marine oil on pain, grouping types of oil as “whole fish” (k = 20), “mussel” (k = 3), “other” (k = 5, 
including cod liver oil, mixture of oil from whole fish and cod liver oil, krill oil, and seal oil), and 
“unspecified” (k = 3). The analysis showed a significant relationship between pain and type of marine 
oil (p = 0.012), where only the effect of mussel oil was statistically significant on its own, having a 
beneficial effect.

3.5. Secondary Outcomes: Inflammation and Function
A total of 23 and 25 trials provided complete data on function and inflammation, respectively.
Meta-analysis showed no overall effect of marine oil on function (SMD −0.01; 95% CI, −0.19–0.18;
p = 0.953) and moderate heterogeneity across studies (I2 = 60%). Including studies with incomplete
data on function and a high risk of outcome-reporting bias, using null-imputations, yielded similar
results (SMD −0.01; 95%CI, −0.13–0.10; p = 0.808).
The overall effect of marine oil on inflammation was significant (SMD −0.28; 95% CI, −0.51–0.06;
p = 0.013), corresponding to an effect of –1.7 mg/dL (−3.0 to −0.4 mg/dL) CRP, with substantial
heterogeneity across studies (I2 = 70%). Including studies with incomplete data on inflammation
and a high risk of outcome-reporting bias yielded similar results (SMD −0.16; 95% CI, −0.29 to
−0.02; p = 0.021). Forest plots for function and inflammation are provided in Figures S2 and S3, and
meta-regression analyses for function and inflammation are provided in Tables S6 and S7.
3.6. Tolerance and Safety
A total of 28, 21, and 24 trials with complete data were included in the analysis of tolerance,
withdrawals due to adverse events, and SAEs, respectively. For all three outcomes, there were no
differences between the intervention and the control group, with an RR of 1.00 (95% CI, 0.96–1.03;
p = 0.814), 0.82 (95% CI, 0.57–1.17; p = 0.279) and 0.75 (95% CI, 0.43–1.30; p = 0.308), respectively. Low
heterogeneity was present for all three outcomes (I2 = 6.5%, 0%, and 0%, respectively).
3.7. Assessment of Reporting Bias
Visual inspection of the funnel plot for pain did not show any signs of asymmetry, and the result
of the Egger test was nonsignificant (intercept α = −0.91; 95% CI, −2.75–0.93; p = 0.339). Similar results
were found for function (intercept α = 0.83; 95% CI, −1.25–2.92; p = 0.442) and inflammation (intercept
α = 0.06; 95% CI, −3.91–1.75, p = 0.462), but asymmetry was present for tolerance, withdrawals due
to adverse events, and SAEs, likely due to outcome-reporting bias. The funnel plots are provided in
Figures S4–S9.
Sensitivity analyses using fixed-effect models yielded similar results as the random-effects models
for pain, function, and inflammation, indicating limited effect of potential small-study bias. Including
trials with incomplete data on pain and a high risk of outcome-reporting bias yielded a slightly lower
but still statistically significant effect (42 trials, SMD −0.16; 95% CI, −0.28 to −0.03; p = 0.012; forest
plot is provided in Figure S10). The effect size was influenced by type of pain outcome, as shown
by a post hoc meta-regression analysis (p = 0.005), with the effect size being nonsignificant for trials
reporting patient-reported pain (SMD −0.18; 95% CI, −0.37–0.00; p = 0.051) and significant for trials
reporting non-patient-reported pain (SMD −0.65; 95% CI, −0.65 to −0.16; p = 0.009). However, two
of the latter trials were deemed low risk of outcome-reporting bias, and the effect on pain was still
significant when excluding trials with both non-patient-reported pain outcome and high/unclear
outcome-reporting bias (corresponding to ‘Adequate’ outcome reporting in Table 2).

4. Discussion
The present systematic review and meta-analysis indicated an effect of marine oil on arthritis,
although with a considerable heterogeneity across the studies. Twenty-two trials (N = 956) with
complete data on pain assessed the effect of marine oil in patients with RA, for whom a favorable effect
was seen, though the confidence in the estimate is considered moderate. Only five trials (N = 403)
assessed the effect of marine oil in patients with OA, and only three trials (N = 150) assessed the
effect in patients with other arthritis diagnoses; we rated the evidence to be of low grade for both
patient groups. Hence, the evidence was not sufficiently robust to determine the effect of marine oil
in patients with diagnoses other than RA. The results for the OA and other/mixed diagnosis groups
were highly heterogeneous (I2 = 82% and 89%, respectively). Osteoarthritis has varying degrees of
inflammation [4]; hence, in the future it might be appropriate to distinguish between OA with higher
and lower degrees of inflammation.
A significant, beneficial effect on pain was found for marine oil with an EPA/DHA ratio >1.5,
suggesting that EPA is more beneficial than DHA, which could be due to a more potent effect
mechanism for EPA than for DHA [94]. An inverse dose-response relationship was found, suggesting
less pain reduction with higher doses, which is against expectations. Previously, RA symptoms have
been reduced at a total EPA and DHA dose of ≥2.6 g/day over ≥12 weeks, and the higher the doses the
less time was needed to demonstrate the effect [95]. This was not supported by our findings, as a dose
of ≥2.6 g/day was not significant in the meta-regression. However, the results should be interpreted
with caution. This finding could be explained by a possible saturation dose-response-relationship, as
different background diets provide varying amounts of EPA and DHA. One of the four trials applying
the highest doses of EPA and DHA was conducted in a Norwegian population [52], which already
has a high intake of fish oil compared to e.g., an American population [52], possibly making it more
difficult to detect an effect. Two of the trials applying the highest doses reduced the patients’ intake of
NSAIDs during the trial [47,52], which also might make it more difficult to detect an effect on pain.
In addition, there is uncertainty about the actual doses ingested, since some of the trials included
non-compliant patients and some did not measure compliance. The optimal type of marine oil could
not be established because only few trials included marine oil from sources other than whole fish.
Conclusions regarding dosage, duration, and ratio of EPA/DHA did not change by including only
trials with RA patients.
Assessing types of adverse effects was beyond the scope of this systematic review, but no
differences were found between intervention and control groups in terms of tolerance, withdrawals
due to adverse events, and SAEs, which is in accordance with the findings of a systematic review of
fish oil administration in older adults [96].
In general, the trials showed serious study limitations and a large degree of heterogeneity
(i.e., “disagreement” with respect to the effect of marine oil). Heterogeneity was expected from pooling
different diagnoses, types of marine oils, and measures within each outcome. The pooling, however,
did increase the power of the analyses. When exploring the heterogeneity with meta-regression
analyses, the majority of the heterogeneity remained unexplained for pain and inflammation, and
quality of evidence for these two outcomes was therefore rated as low. When only trials with RA
patients were included in a post hoc meta-analysis of pain, the heterogeneity was low (I2 = 32%),
i.e., these trials generally agree on the effect. Post hoc analyses showed that heterogeneity for function
was explained to a large degree by diagnosis and/or trial duration, and the quality of evidence was
rated as moderate.
Poor reporting was a frequent issue in the trials, limiting their inclusion in the meta-analysis and
making their methods nontransparent. Consequently, risk of bias may have been high, although it
was frequently judged as unclear. Publication bias and outcome-reporting bias were also potential
limitations. However, funnel plots, Egger tests, and sensitivity analyses including trials with incomplete
data did not show evidence that these bias types were affecting the estimates for pain, function,
or inflammation.

To our knowledge this is the first comprehensive systematic review and meta-analysis regarding
the effect of marine oil on arthritis. In contrast to previous meta-analyses [14–17], we included all
types of arthritis, all types of marine oil (i.e., oils of any marine origin), and did not include vegetable
sources of n-3 PUFA (e.g., flaxseed oil). In addition, we applied extensive search strategies.
5. Conclusions
In conclusion, this meta-analysis suggests a small favorable effect of marine oil in reducing pain
in patients with arthritis (SMD < −0.2) [97], but the evidence was of low quality. There is moderate
quality evidence for an effect in RA patients. In contrast, the effect was statistically non-significant in
patients with OA, but our confidence in the estimate is very low. Thus, more research is needed in
order to provide evidence for firm conclusions regarding the effect of marine oil in OA and other types
of arthritis, but also regarding the optimal dose, ratio of EPA and DHA, and which type of marine oil
is preferable. If RA patients would like to try marine oil (i.e., oil from any marine origin), the results
suggest a product with an EPA/DHA ratio >1.5, and there do not seem to be adverse effects.
