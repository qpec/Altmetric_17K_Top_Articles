Abstract 
Acute kidney injury (AKI) and fluids are closely linked through oliguria, which is a marker of the former and a trig-
ger for administration of the latter. Recent progress in this field has challenged the physiological and clinical rational 
of using oliguria as a trigger for the administration of fluid and brought attention to the delicate balance between 
benefits and harms of different aspects of fluid management in critically ill patients, in particular those with AKI. This 
narrative review addresses various aspects of fluid management in AKI outlining physiological aspects, the effects of 
crystalloids and colloids on kidney function and the effect of various resuscitation and de-resuscitation strategies on 
the course and outcome of AKI.

Introduction
Hypovolaemia is accepted as a major risk factor for the 
development of acute kidney injury (AKI) [1] and is asso-
ciated with low urinary output [2]. Moreover, oliguria 
often occurs as the first clinical sign of AKI [3] and is one 
of the two criteria defining AKI according to the KDIGO 
guidelines [4]. Hence, it is understandable that oliguria 
was the second most frequent trigger for fluid administra-
tion in critically ill patients in the international FENICE 
point prevalence study [5]. Considering that in the criti-
cally ill the two most frequent aetiologies of AKI are sep-
sis and hypovolaemia [6], timely fluid administration may 
be a preventive measure against AKI and should be effec-
tive both through restoration of circulating volume and 
improving impaired renal perfusion. However, there are 
many uncertainties about the benefit of fluid administra-
tion for the prevention and treatment of AKI. Many forms 
of AKI are considered volume unresponsive [1], in par-
ticular in cases that are not hypovolaemic and if AKI is not 
caused by renal hypoperfusion, but rather nephrotoxics or 
renal inflammation. In those situations injudicious use of 
fluids carries its own risks of contributing to the develop-
ment or worsening of AKI by fluid overload (Fig. 1) and 
sometimes necessitating initiation of renal replacement 
therapy (RRT) [7]. Fluid overload may even impair renal 
recovery after AKI [8]. Overall the risk–benefit balance of 
fluid administration in AKI depends on the aetiology of 
AKI, the volume status of the patients, the types of fluid 
used and likely also the timing, rates and volumes used. 
This review addresses various aspects of fluid manage-
ment in AKI specifying the physiological rationing and the 
effects of crystalloids and colloids on kidney function and 
outlining the effects of various resuscitation and de-resus-
citation strategies on the course and outcome of AKI.
Physiological rationale for fluid management 
in AKI
The physiological rationale for administration of fluids in 
critically ill patients is to restore tissue perfusion. In abso-
lute hypovolaemia, renal perfusion may be compromised 
as a result of decreased cardiac output (CO). Thus, in 
that case fluid therapy seems a logical option to increase 
the stroke volume (SV) and CO, renal blood flow (RBF), 
renal oxygen supply, and glomerular filtration rate (GFR). 
However, AKI or oliguria per se may not reflect renal

macrovascular hypoperfusion. Additionally, only severe 
oliguria is associated with development of creatinine-
based AKI [9, 10]. Of note, fluid administration causes 
increased workload to kidneys because of increased fil-
tration of sodium chloride leading to increased reabsorp-
tive activity, and increased consumption of  
O2 and ATP 
in tubular cells.
In addition to RBF, colloid osmotic pressure of plasma 
proteins and glomerular arterial tone are factors that 
affect the pressure gradient between glomerular capil-
lary and Bowman’s space (Fig. 1). GFR is dependent on 
this pressure gradient. Thus, increasing CO may lead to 
increased RBF and increased GFR. However, in estab-
lished AKI, RBF and GFR seem to correlate poorly [11]. 
Furthermore, in early experimental septic AKI, RBF is 
often normal or even higher [12]. Thus, fluids aimed to 
increase RBF may not have the desired effect on GFR if 
CO is normal or increased. The RBF fraction of CO may 
also be reduced from normal in septic patients [13]. 
Intent to maintain or increase renal oxygen delivery by 
administration of fluids may also be questioned, because 
in AKI the metabolic activity is decreased with decreas-
ing GFR, although both animal [14] and clinical data [15] 
suggest that sodium reabsorption becomes less metaboli-
cally efficient in AKI. Moreover, the causal relationship 
between periodic ischaemia and development of new 
AKI has been rejected [16].
In clinical practice, indications for fluid therapy other 
than absolute hypovolaemia are unclear. Changes of 
RBF, renal oxygen supply or GFR are not measured in 
clinical practice. However, fluids are often administered 
to critically ill patients on the basis of other indications 
for prevention or treatment of AKI, although no gener-
ally accepted rules regarding indications, timing, choice 
of fluid, rates and volumes, or duration of fluid therapy 
exist.
While hypotension (59%) and oliguria (18%) are the 
most frequent indications for fluid administration in 
ICU patients [5], there are limited physiological ration-
ale and clinical data to support the benefits of fluids in 
these situations. Activation of the renin–angiotensin 
system and increased antidiuretic hormone may cause 
retention of water and salt, which may be further aggra-
vated by excess fluid therapy. In septic shock, the primary 
pathophysiologic phenomena are arterial and venous 
dilatation, causing a vasoplegic state not restored by giv-
ing fluids but rather vasoconstricting agents to alleviate 
hypotension. Additionally, microvascular thrombosis, 
endothelial injury and shedding of glycocalyx lead to 
abnormal microcirculation [17] and increased capillary 
leak [18] decreasing the potential benefits of fluids. How-
ever, the promotion of diuresis in oliguric states by fluid 
therapy may seem logical in the prevention of rhabdomy-
olysis and IV-contrast-induced AKI, but may not be ben-
eficial in the latter cases [19]. The advantages of fluids in 
Fig. 1 Fluid overload and interstitial oedema can contribute to the maintenance of AKI. Increased central venous pressure reduces the transrenal 
pressure gradient for RBF, while increased interstitial and tubular pressure may reduce or abolish the net glomerular filtration pressure gradient. 
Increased preglomerular resistance, in response to tubular injury, further reduces RBF and glomerular capillary hydrostatic pressure and hyperchlo-
raemia might contribute to this effect, which represents a pathophysiological activation of the tubulo-glomerular feedback mechanism. Finally, 
development of intra-abdominal hypertension restricts venous drainage and extrinsically compresses the kidney [64]. AKI acute kidney injury, GFR 
glomerular filtration rate, RBF renal blood flow

oliguric states related to acute illness are less clear. There 
seems to be dissociation between macrohaemodynamic 
response to fluid challenge and renal response; half of 
the oliguric ICU patients are not renal responders [20]. 
Therefore, the use of hypotension or oliguria alone as 
triggers for fluid therapy is often not fully supported by 
physiological reasoning. Notably, haemodilution caused 
by excess fluids may be deleterious. In support of this 
notion, animal data suggest that RBC transfusion may 
improve renal microvascular oxygenation [21], but con-
firmatory human data have been inconclusive.
Of note, the effects of fluid therapy are plausibly highly 
dependent on the phase of acute illness conceptualized 
into four different phases: rescue, optimization, stabili-
zation and de-escalation [22]. Early beneficial effects of 
fluids in the resuscitation phase may turn to deleterious 
fluid accumulation in later phases. Similarly, triggers such 
as oliguria may indicate hypovolaemia and decreased tis-
sue perfusion in the early resuscitation phase but may 
indicate established AKI [4] later in the course of critical 
illness.
The impacts of choice of fluid, volume, rate and dura-
tion of administration of fluids are discussed in the fol-
lowing paragraphs.
Colloid solutions
It has been a common belief that the administration of 
colloid solutions to critically ill patients would reduce the 
overall need for fluid as compared with the administra-
tion of crystalloids. We may estimate the potential fluid-
sparing effects of colloid use vs. crystalloid use using data 
from the recent blinded randomised trials. These data 
indicate a modest fluid-sparing effect of colloids at least 
in general ICU patients (Table 1). In patients with sepsis, 
this effect may be limited.
In the last decade there have been major changes in the 
use of IV fluids in critical care and ICU settings, in par-
ticular that of the colloid solutions [23]. The changes in 
fluid practice occurred after the publication of large trials 
and updated systematic reviews showing increased rates 
of AKI and use of RRT with hydroxyethyl starch (HES) 
in critically ill patients [24, 25], including those with sep-
sis [26–28] and increased mortality in patients with sep-
sis [26, 27]. As a result, the Surviving Sepsis Campaign 
(SSC) guideline recommended against the use of HES 
[29], the FDA issued a boxed warning for HES based on 
the risk of AKI [30], and the European Commission made 
the legally binding decision that HES can no longer be 
used in critically ill patients including those with sepsis 
and burn injury [31].
Gelatine is the other widely used synthetic colloid solu-
tion; however, there are very limited data on the ben-
efits and harms, including risk of kidney impairment 
of this colloid. A recently updated systematic review 
included only three trials assessing rates of AKI in only 
212 patients randomised to gelatine vs. crystalloid/albu-
min; the point estimate indicated a 35% increased relative 
risk of AKI with gelatine [32]. Even though this result was 
not statistically significant it supports the associations 
of increased risk of AKI with gelatine use in before-and-
after cohort studies done in patients with sepsis [33] and 
those undergoing cardiac surgery [34].
Albumin is a natural colloid and appears to be safe 
to use in patients at risk or with established AKI. Thus 
the requirements for RRT were similar in the albumin 
and saline groups of the SAFE trial, in which 6997 ICU 
patients with clinical signs of hypovolaemia were ran-
domised [35]. Similar effects were observed in the ran-
domised open-label ALBIOS trial, in which 1818 patients 
with severe sepsis or septic shock received 60 g albumin 
per day targeting a serum albumin level of greater than 
30 g/L vs. no albumin; neither rates of AKI nor use of 
RRT differed between the groups [36]. These results are 
supported by the recent network meta-analysis finding 
no difference in the use of RRT with albumin vs. crystal-
loid solutions in patients with sepsis with moderate cer-
tainty [28]. In both the SAFE and ALBIOS trials, net fluid 
balances were less positive in the albumin vs. control 
groups, but the differences were modest. As no outcomes 
differed with statistical significance between the inter-
vention groups in these trials, the potential benefit of less 
positive fluid balance with the use of albumin remains to 
be documented.
Should colloid solutions be used in patients with AKI 
or those at risk of AKI? Within the present evidence 
base, we can recommend with high certainty that HES 
should not be used in these patients (Fig. 2). For the use 
of gelatines a similar recommendation appears warranted 
for patients with AKI even though the certainty is much 
lower for the reasons given above (Fig. 2). Albumin, on 
the other hand, appears to be safe in these patients, but 
at the same time there appears to be limited benefit from

albumin as compared to crystalloid solutions [28, 37] 
(Fig. 2). As the use of albumin may be on the rise in ICUs 
[23], we need large trials assessing which settings, pro-
tocols or subgroups of critically ill patients may benefit 
from this expensive and limited resource.
Crystalloid solutions
While crystalloids are now the accepted first-line IV 
fluid in most ICU patients, the most appropriate crystal-
loid to use in patients with AKI is unclear. The impact of 
the chloride composition of crystalloid fluids on renal 
function has been the focus of research because in ani-
mal models increasing plasma chloride levels produce 
progressive renal vasoconstriction and a GFR [38]. This 
effect is demonstrable in healthy volunteers where renal 
artery blood flow velocity and renal cortical tissue perfu-
sion fall after administration of 2 L of 0.9% saline, which 
has a higher chloride composition than normal plasma, 
but not after administration of 2 L of a buffered crystal-
loid with a similar chloride concentration to plasma [39]. 
Similar effects have been shown in a number of animal 
experiments [40, 41]. Although these observations lend 
plausibility to the hypothesis that the chloride composi-
tion of IV fluids can alter their effect on GFR, it is unclear 
whether use of 0.9% saline increases the risk of develop-
ment or progression of renal dysfunction. In particular, 
because oxygen is offloaded to the tissues more effec-
tively as pH falls (as a result of the Bohr effect [42]) and 
chloride-rich solutions are acidifying [43], it is unclear 
whether 0.9% saline impairs or enhances renal tissue 
oxygen delivery compared to buffered crystalloids. There 
are no published clinical trials specifically comparing 
different crystalloids in the setting of AKI and although 
a recent meta-analysis suggested that the use of high 
chloride fluids was associated with a 60% increase in the 
risk of developing acute kidney injury [44], the statistical 
significance of this observation was dependent on the 
findings of a single before-and-after study [45]. In this 
before-and-after study [45] chloride-rich fluids, including 
a potentially nephrotoxic gelatin-based colloid [33, 46], 
were removed from the ICU following a period of obser-
vation, and the influence of unmeasured confounders 
may have contributed to fluctuations in AKI incidence 
over time [47].
Two observational studies not included in the afore-
mentioned meta-analysis [44] reported no significant 
association between choice of intravenous crystalloid 
and AKI risk [48, 49]. In addition, a recent network meta-
analysis comprising 14 randomised controlled trials 
(RCTs) in septic patients showed that the use of buff-
ered crystalloids compared with saline was not associ-
ated with a difference in RRT requirements [28]. In the 
Saline vs. Plasma-Lyte  
148® (a gluconate/acetate-buffered 
crystalloid) for ICU fluid Therapy (SPLIT) trial there 
were no significant between-group differences in serum 
creatinine levels, rates of AKI, or requirements for RRT 
[50]. Similarly, in the recent Balanced Crystalloids vs. 
Saline in the ICU trial [51] (the SALT trial) there were 
no between-group difference in serum urea or creati-
nine measures, major adverse kidney events (in-hospital 
mortality, receipt of new RRT or final inpatient serum 
creatinine of at least 200% of baseline) recorded up until 
30 days post enrolment.
In the SPLIT trial [50] and the SALT trial [51] the 
volumes of crystalloid delivered to patients were small 
(median of 2 L and 1.5 L, respectively) and both study 
populations were dominated by low acuity patients. 
As a result, it is plausible that the dose of 0.9% saline 
administered in these studies was insufficient to cause 
clinically evident renal toxicity even if the potential for 
such toxicity exists. In the SALT study, among patients 
who received the largest volumes of crystalloid, there 
appeared to be more AKI in patients who received 0.9% 
saline [51]. However, systematic differences between 
patients that received high volumes of 0.9% saline com-
pared with patients that received high volumes of buff-
ered crystalloids cannot be excluded. As a result, the 
comparison is subject to bias and may not reflect a causal 
relationship between 0.9% saline use and AKI risk. In a 
recent cohort study of ICU patients who received large 
volume fluid resuscitation, defined as greater than 
60 mL/kg over a 24-h period, there was no robust associ-
ation between chloride load and AKI risk after adjusting 
for illness severity [52].
Low-quality data raise the possibility that buffered 
crystalloids may be associated with a lower AKI risk than

[50, 51]. There are no data comparing different buffered 
crystalloids in patients with AKI or evaluating whether or 
not the choice of buffered crystalloid affects the risk of 
AKI developing. For now, at least it appears that when it 
comes to the risk of development or progression of AKI, 
0.9% saline and buffered crystalloids are all acceptable 
choices for IV fluid management in critically ill patients 
(Fig. 2).
Fluid volumes
One of the goals in the landmark trial of Early Goal-
Directed Therapy (EGDT) in septic shock by Rivers and 
colleagues was a urinary output of at least 0.5 mL/kg/h, 
but the protocol did not specify how to achieve this goal 
[53]. As stated above, absolute hypovolaemia causes olig-
uria, which may have led to the notion that low urine out-
put may be due to decreased renal perfusion in critically 
ill and that fluid administration will alleviate the condi-
tion. This is likely to be oversimplified—especially in the 
case of septic AKI [54]. Also, a potential harmful effect 
of increased fluid balance has been suggested by observa-
tional data indicating increased risk of AKI with increas-
ing central venous pressure (CVP) in adjusted analyses of 
ICU patients [55]. Nevertheless, low urine output is still 
one of the most frequent indications for fluid administra-
tion in critically ill patients [5]. Similarly, a study in severe 
sepsis and septic shock found oliguria as an indication for 
a fluid bolus in 26% of cases, but interestingly the urinary 
output remained unchanged 1 h following a fluid bolus 
[56]. In a worldwide survey of intensive care specialists, 
almost half of the respondents expected an increase in 
urinary output of more than 20 mL/h in order to con-
stitute a positive response to fluid administration [57]. 
Recent data from the randomised CLASSIC trial sug-
gest that additional fluid may not increase urinary output 
[58] (Fig. 3). Thus, there may be dissociation between the 
expectation of clinicians to the response of a fluid bolus 
in terms of increased urinary output and the observed 
response. In the case of a modest response in urinary out-
put to a 1-L fluid administration (e.g. a 5 mL/h increase), 
the extra fluid would take days to excrete without other 
interventions.
Although urine output is a frequent indication for 
fluid administration, there are limited data to support 
this practice, and high-quality data on fluid volumes 
and AKI from RCTs are sparse. A systematic review and 
meta-analysis of RCTs on fluid management in sepsis and 
ARDS following the resuscitation phase found no statisti-
cally significant difference in use of RRT for conservative 
vs. liberal strategies (risk ratio 0.88; 95% CI 0.64–1.22), 
but the analysis was characterized by imprecision as only 
three trials were included [59]. The CLASSIC trial where 
patients with septic shock who had received the initial 
fluid resuscitation were randomised to either a protocol 
with restrictive fluid resuscitation or a protocol aiming 
at standard care reported fewer patients with worsening 
of AKI in the fluid restriction group [58]. In the three-
armed PROCESS trial, patients with septic shock ran-
domised to the protocol-based standard therapy group 
received more fluids and had higher risk of new onset 
renal failure compared to patients randomised to the 
EGDT group and the usual care group [60]. Of note, 
fluids were only one part of the intervention in the trial 
which also included vasopressors, dobutamine and blood 
transfusions. Importantly, progression to chronic kid-
ney disease was not an outcome measure in any of these 
trials; it may be a more robust outcome as it will not be 
affected by the potential different dilution of creatinine 
by differences in fluid volumes.
Observational studies have most often assessed the 
association between mortality and increased fluid bal-
ance in AKI rather than specifically fluid input which 
hampers the interpretation of fluid input, because 
decreased fluid output as well may lead to increased fluid 
balance. With this limitation kept in mind, observational 
studies have indicated harm with increased fluid balance 
in AKI [61] and in patients receiving renal replacement 
Fig. 3 Volumes observed in the first 24 h after randomisation of 
ICU patients with septic shock in the two intervention groups in 
the CLASSIC trial [58]. 151 patients were randomised at nine ICUs to 
a protocol restricting volumes of resuscitation fluids vs a protocol 
aiming at standard care after the initial management of septic shock. 
Volumes of resuscitation fluid and urinary output are presented as 
medians (lines) and interquartile ranges (boxes) in the restriction (blue) 
and standard care (green) groups. The additional resuscitation fluid 
given in the standard care group did not appear to increase urinary 
output as compared to the restrictive group, increasing the risk of 
volume overload in the former group

therapy [62]. Even though these analyses were adjusted 
for illness severity, conclusions must be drawn with 
caution because of the risk of confounding, and infer-
ence about causality cannot be made since the increased 
fluid balance might be indicative of illness severity not 
reflected in the summary scores that were used to per-
form adjustments.
Taken together, there is evidence to suggest that higher 
fluid inputs may precipitate rather than alleviate AKI, but 
no firm conclusions can be made from the available data 
(Fig. 2). Even though higher fluid volumes appear to be 
associated with harm, the differences in the compared 
protocols hamper the clinical applicability. AKI com-
prises a broad spectrum of pathophysiological charac-
teristics, and a ‘one size fits all’ approach regarding fluid 
input is unlikely to be obtainable. Nevertheless, a hesi-
tant approach to persistent fluid administration with the 
aim of increasing urinary output is likely to be prudent 
(Fig. 2).
De-resuscitation strategies
Even when fluid resuscitation is carefully guided and 
early vasopressor support is employed, initial treatment 
of acute critical illness almost always results in a positive 
fluid balance and tissue oedema, in particular in patients 
with AKI. Thus, after this initial phase, treatment focus 
should shift towards the prevention of further fluid over-
load and the active removal of accumulated excess salt 
and water. Adopting such a proactive approach to fluid 
management involves both appreciation of the balance of 
fluid inputs and outputs and clinical monitoring for signs 
of fluid overload [63, 64]. Any strategy to remove fluid 
must commence with the rational management of fluid 
input to minimize initial and ongoing fluid accumulation 
[22] and be accompanied by continuous management of 
fluid status to prevent fluid overload if obligate intake is 
in excess of endogenous fluid output and resolving fluid 
accumulation once stability has been achieved by inter-
vening to increase fluid removal. To achieve fluid removal 
in excess of spontaneous losses, either to resolve or pre-
vent fluid overload, there are two major options available 
to the clinician, diuretic pharmacotherapy or extracor-
poreal ultrafiltration. Choice of diuretic therapy over 
mechanical fluid removal will be dependent on renal func-
tion, baseline urine output, electrolyte status and severity 
of fluid overload; however, the response to therapy should 
be regularly reassessed to make sure the choice remains 
appropriate. While evidence exists that the use of diuret-
ics to treat established AKI is ineffective [65] and may 
delay definitive AKI management with RRT [66], their use 
in a large population of patients with AKI in the ICU has 
not been associated with increased mortality [67]. Thus, 
the use of diuretics specifically to manage fluid balance in 
patients may be logical and clinically supportable, as long 
as response is adequately assessed [68].
When employing an active fluid management strategy 
with diuretics or mechanical ultrafiltration it is impor-
tant to distinguish both the overall level of fluid overload 
(the eventual target) and the capacity to rapidly remove 
fluid from the circulation without inducing haemody-
namic instability. In the sickest patients, extent of fluid 
overload and tolerance of its removal may be widely dis-
associated, thereby greatly complicating management 
of severe fluid overload. Importantly, different forms of 
monitoring inform clinicians on these differing aspects of 
therapy; static assessments of fluid status inform on the 
extent of fluid accumulation, while dynamic assessments 
of cardiac output and tissue perfusion provide informa-
tion on tolerance of rate of removal.
Determining the total quantity of fluid overload is chal-
lenging as charted fluid balances are often inaccurate and 
do not account for unmeasured fluid losses nor change 
in “flesh weight” during prolonged critical illness. How-
ever charted daily fluid balance does appear to be a more 
useful guide in determining risk of fluid overload than 
daily weight, which can be inaccurate in the critical care 
setting [69]. However even the most accurate fluid bal-
ance will fail to account for uncertain fluid status at ICU 
admission. Bioelectrical impedance body composition 
analysis (BIA) is a non-invasive method of fluid assess-
ment which can provide estimates of total body, extracel-
lular and intracellular water to allow the quantification 
of fluid overload [70]. Similarly, serum N-terminal pro-
B-type natriuretic peptide (BNP) has been examined as 
a biomarker of cardiac response to circulatory overfill-
ing. In the ICU, fluid overload as defined by BIA and/or 
BNP has been associated with adverse outcomes; how-
ever, these measures are not well correlated [71]. Overall, 
these methods, while interesting, have not been exten-
sively validated in the critically ill, and their benefit over 
use of a well-kept fluid balance has not yet been estab-
lished [72].
During the process of fluid removal physiological 
assessment of fluid status can be as important as dur-
ing initial resuscitation, as if fluid removal is excessive or 
out of pace with vascular refilling hypovolaemia-induced 
falls in cardiac output can increase the risk of recurrent 
renal and other organ injury. The commencement of 
fluid removal can be considered as a “reverse fluid chal-
lenge” and demands monitoring in the same fashion as 
the response to bolus fluid administration. The possibil-
ity of other organ injury during fluid removal should be 
considered both clinically and in the design of studies. 
Follow-up of a small subgroup of patients from the fluids 
and catheters treatment trial (FACTT), where conserva-
tive fluid management (with diuretics) was associated 
 813
with lesser duration of mechanical ventilation in lung 
injury, showed poorer cognitive function after recovery 
from critical illness in patients in the conservative vs. the 
liberal fluid group. Hypothetically, this could be related 
to transient episodes of cerebral hypoperfusion during 
fluid removal [73], as there was a higher incidence of 
“new shock” in the conservative arm. Recently a simpler 
“FACCT-LITE” fluid strategy has been described [74]. 
This approach was associated with similar respiratory 
and renal outcomes compared to the conservative group 
in FACCT, but with a “new shock” rate similar to the lib-
eral arm, suggesting the value of haemodynamic stability 
for fluid removal emphasised in this regimen.
Overall, fluid overload is strongly associated with 
adverse outcomes in critical illness; however, its resolu-
tion can be difficult and prone to complications. Mini-
mizing, as much as possible, the acquisition of fluid 
overload is thus of key importance. Fluid removal strat-
egies need to be carefully titrated and monitored for 
haemodynamic tolerance and continuous methods may 
be better tolerated. Strategies to limit or resolve fluid 
overload in critically ill adults or children with lung 
injury or sepsis have been shown to increase the number 
of ventilator-free days and decrease ICU length of stay; 
however, the effect on mortality and other long-term out-
comes remains uncertain [59]. Large randomised trials 
considering both short- and long-term clinical outcomes 
are needed to determine optimal fluid strategies in criti-
cally ill patients including those with AKI.
Perspectives
As detailed above, optimal fluid management has great 
beneficial potential in critically ill patients at risk of AKI 
and those with established AKI. On the other hand, there 
is an imminent risk of harming these patients by the 
choice, timing, rate and volume of IV fluids. There is an 
urgent need for better technologies to assess blood volume 
and hydration status of our patients beyond fluid respon-
siveness. Bioelectrical impedance vector analysis (BIVA) 
may hold some promise [72]. We have improved the fluid 
management of these patients (Table 2) and may con-
tinue to do so through the conduct of high-quality clinical 
research to ensure that we give the right fluid to the right 
patient at the right time and rate. If so, we will continue 
to improve the care and overall outcomes of critically ill 
patients at risk of AKI and those with established AKI.

Intervention
Progress
Process
HES solutions
Established the nephrotoxic effect of HES in critically ill patients
RCTs and systematic reviews with low risk of bias showing increased rates of AKI, use of 
RRT and mortality in critically ill patients receiving HES vs crystalloid solutions
Gelatine solutions
Increasing evidence of nephrotoxic effects of gelatine in critically ill patients
The overall low quantity and quality of the evidence has been established. The results 
of the before-and-after studies associating gelatines with AKI are supported by the 
limited data from RCTs [32]
Crystalloid solutions
Increasing focus on the benefits and harms of the different crystalloid solutions
The results of the physiologic and before-and-after studies associating saline with AKI 
have been questioned by RCT data [47, 50]. Large low risk of bias RCTs are now funded 
to assess if buffered crystalloid solutions vs saline improve kidney outcomes
Fluid boluses
Increasing focus on the uncertain efficacy of fluid boluses on oliguria in ICU patients
The results of the before-and-after studies questioning the effects of fluid boluses on 
urinary output in clinical practice [75] are now supported by RCT data [76]
Fluid volumes
Increasing focus on the negative effects of higher fluid volumes in critically ill patients, 
in particular those with established AKI
The results of cohort studies associating higher positive fluid balance with worse 
outcome in ICU patients are now being supported by data from RCTs and systematic 
reviews [58, 59]
