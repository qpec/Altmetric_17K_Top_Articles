Abstract
Borrelia miyamotoi is an increasingly recognized human pathogen transmitted by Ixodes ticks in the Northern 
Hemisphere. In North America, infection prevalences of B. miyamotoi are characteristically low (<10%) in Ixodes 
scapularis (Say; Acari: Ixodidae) and Ixodes pacificus (Cooley & Kohls; Acari: Ixodidae), both of which readily bite 
humans. We tested 3,255 host-seeking I. pacificus nymphs collected in 2004 from 79 sites throughout Mendocino 
County in north-coastal California for presence of B. miyamotoi. 
The collection sites represented a variety of forest 
types ranging from hot, dry oak woodlands in the southeast, to coastal redwoods in the west, and Ponderosa pine 
and Douglas fir-dominated areas in the northern part of the county. We found that B. miyamotoi was geographically 
widespread, but infected I. pacificus nymphs infrequently (cumulative prevalence of 1.4%). Infection prevalence 
was not significantly associated with geographic region or woodland type, and neither density of host-seeking 
nymphs, nor infection with Borrelia burgdorferi sensu stricto was associated with B. miyamotoi infection status in 
individual ticks. Because B. burgdorferi prevalence at the same sites was previously associated with woodland type 
and nymphal density, our results suggest that despite sharing a common vector, the primary modes of enzootic 
maintenance for the two pathogens are likely different.
Key words:  Borrelia miyamotoi, Ixodes pacificus, relapsing fever spirochetes, tick-borne disease
Borrelia miyamotoi is a hard tick-borne relapsing fever spirochete 
first isolated from Ixodes persulcatus Schulze in Japan in 1994 
(Fukunaga et al. 1995) that has recently gained recognition as an 
emerging human pathogen (Platonov et al. 2011, Krause et al. 2015, 
Molloy et al. 2015, Wagemakers et al. 2015). Human cases of B. miy-
amotoi disease have now been reported in temperate regions of Asia, 
Europe, and eastern North America where I. persulcatus Schultz, 
Ixodes ricinus L., and Ixodes scapularis (Say; Acari: Ixodidae), the 
ticks that likely serve as primary tick vectors of this pathogen to 
humans, are present (Platonov et al. 2011, Chowdri et al. 2013, 
Hovius et al. 2013, Sato et al. 2014, Molloy et al. 2015).
Natural infection with B. miyamotoi occurs in a variety of 
Ixodes spp., including the closely related group responsible for 
transmission of Borrelia burgdorferi sensu lato (s.l.), the spirochetes 
that cause Lyme disease. In North America, vector competence for 
B. miyamotoi has been demonstrated for I. scapularis (Scoles et al. 
2001, Breuner et al. 2017) and is suspected for Ixodes pacificus 
(Cooley & Kohls; Acari: Ixodidae). Though both the nymphal and 
adult stages of these ticks are frequently observed biting humans, 
nymphs are more commonly associated with pathogen transmission, 
and therefore, recognized as having greater epidemiological signifi-
cance (Merten and Durden 2000, Eisen et al. 2017). For that reason, 
many surveys, including this one focus specifically on the nymphal 
stage. However, there is also evidence suggesting that transmission 
by larval ticks may account for some human exposure to B. miy-
amotoi (Barbour et al. 2009, Molloy et al. 2015, van Duijvendijk 
et al. 2016).
Globally, prevalence of B. miyamotoi in host-seeking Ixodes ticks 
ranges from 1 to 10%, with most local estimates falling closer to the 
low end (Scoles et al. 2001, Barbour et al. 2009, Rollend et al. 2013, 
Sinski et al. 2016, Rar et al. 2017). In California, B. miyamotoi 
infection prevalences of 1.6 and 1.7% were reported in I. pacificus 
nymphs from Mendocino and Sonoma counties (Mun et al. 2006, 
Crowder et al. 2014), and 1.4% statewide (Padgett et al. 2014). 
Collectively, these studies reveal that B. miyamotoi is widespread but 
usually at low prevalence in host-seeking tick populations. Current

 genotypic evidence supports categorizing the species into three types: 
Asian (primarily vectored by I. persulcatus and I. ricinus), European 
(I. ricinus), and American (I. scapularis and I. pacificus), with iso-
lates showing little or no genetic variability within type (Geller 
et al. 2012, Barbour 2014, Crowder et al. 2014, Takano et al. 2014, 
Mukhacheva et al. 2015, Cook et al. 2016).
Intriguingly, Lyme disease spirochetes typically infect Ixodes 
nymphs with greater frequency (prevalence 3–49%) than B. miy-
amotoi in areas where the two pathogens are sympatric (Barbour 
et al. 2009, Wagemakers et al. 2015, Rar et al. 2017) and there is 
considerably more genetic diversity within the B. burgdorferi s.l. 
species complex than B. miyamotoi (Girard et al. 2009, Margos 
et al. 2011, Mechai et al. 2015, Rar et al. 2017). In California, 
prevalence of B. burgdorferi s.l. in host-seeking I. pacificus nymphs 
is typically 2–3 times (3.2–4.9%) that of B. miyamotoi (Padgett 
et al. 2014).
Here we 1) describe the distribution and prevalence of B. miy-
amotoi in host-seeking I. pacificus nymphs collected throughout 
Mendocino County, CA, a county where both B. miyamotoi and 
B. burgdorferi s.s. are maintained in enzootic cycles and the ecology 
of the latter has been well-studied, 2) compare infection prevalence 
in nymphs across woodland types, and 3) compare these findings 
with those previously described for B. burgdorferi sensu stricto (s.s.) 
in the same sample population of ticks.
Materials and Methods
Study Sites and 
Tick Collection
The I. pacificus nymphs tested in this study were collected from 
79 dense woodland sites throughout Mendocino County, CA, 
in 2004 (Eisen et al. 2006, Eisen et al. 2010). Locations were 
sampled twice within the period of peak nymphal activity in 
the spring (late April to early June). The collection sites were 
selected to reflect the variability of climate across the range of 
I. pacificus habitat in Mendocino County as well as to account 
for the ecological diversity associated with the different forest 
types where these ticks are present. Woodland categories were 
designated based on the predominant tree species at the sampling 
sites, including redwood (n = 11), coastal pine (n = 3), inland pine 
(n = 8), hardwood (n = 19), hardwood/conifer (n = 22), mixed tan 
oak/madrone or Douglas fir with a redwood influence (n = 4), or 
tanoak (n = 12).
Tree species found at sites categorized as redwood included 
coastal redwood (Sequoia sempervirens D. Don), Douglas fir 
(Pseudotsuga menziesii [Mirb.] Franco), tanoak (Lithocarpus 
densiflorus [Hook. & Arn.] Manos, Cannon & S.H. Oh), and 
California bay (Umbellularia californica [Hook & Arn.] Nutt.). 
Coastal pine sites included mainly Bishop pine (Pinus muricata 
D. Don) with coastal redwood or Douglas fir. Inland pine wood-
lands consisted of Ponderosa pine (Pinus ponderosa Douglas ex 
C. Lawson) and Douglas fir. Hardwood sites were comprised of 
Quercus spp. oaks, Pacific madrone (Arbutus menziesii Pursh) 
and California bay. Hardwood/conifer sites included mixed oaks, 
Pacific madrone, California bay, and Douglas fir or Ponderosa pine. 
Sites designated as mixed tanoak/madrone or Douglas fir with a 
redwood influence included mixed tanoak, Pacific madrone, or 
Douglas fir with redwood influence in or adjacent to the sampling 
site. Tanoak consisted primarily of tanoak with coastal redwood, 
Douglas fir, or Pacific madrone. More detailed climatic data and 
tick sampling methodology can be found in Eisen et al. (2006) and 
Eisen et al. (2010).
PCR-Based Detection of B. miyamotoi in 
Tick 
Samples
For most sites (n = 59), DNA extracts from at least 45 individual 
I. pacificus nymphs were tested. Another eight sites contributed be-
tween 11 and 32 nymphs, leaving 12 sites with 10 or fewer ticks 
tested. DNA had been previously extracted using the DNeasy Blood 
and Tissue kit (Qiagen, Valencia, CA) according to the manufac-
turer’s protocol for animal tissue (Girard et al. 2009), eluted in 
50 µl deionized sterile water, and stored at −20°C. We used a pair 
of real-time TaqMan PCR assays (Graham et al. 2016) to detect 
B. miyamotoi: a singleplex assay targeting the glycerophosphodies-
ter phosphodiesterase (glpQ) gene of B. miyamotoi, and a duplex 
assay targeting the adenylosuccinate lyase (purB) gene of B. miy-
amotoi and the actin gene in I. scapularis and I. pacificus. The actin 
target allowed us to verify the presence of amplifiable DNA in each 
sample. Each reaction included 4.8 µl DNA extract and 5.2 µl master 
mix as described in Graham et al. (2016).
Prior to running individual samples through the assay, we con-
firmed a limit of detection equivalent to ≤5 genomes per reaction in 
the presence of background tick DNA from the Mendocino collec-
tion extracts. Specifically, we pooled equal volumes of DNA from 
randomly selected specimens collected at 12 different sites. The 
pooled DNA tested positive for the tick actin target and negative for 
both B. miyamotoi targets. We then spiked aliquots of the B. miy-
amotoi-free tick DNA with genomic B. miyamotoi DNA. Using an 
estimated genome size of 1.3 × 106 nucleotides (Kingry et al. 2017), 
we calculated the approximate number of B. miyamotoi genome 
copies per ng of DNA. We determined the double-stranded concen-
tration of our B. miyamotoi DNA stock using a Qubit 2.0 fluorom-
eter and the Qubit dsDNA HS Assay Kit (ThermoFisher Scientific 
Inc., Waltman, MA) immediately before preparing serial dilutions 
to achieve the equivalent of 10, 5, or 1 genome per reaction. Six 
replicates of each concentration were tested and all replicates con-
taining the equivalent of five or more genomes were positive for 
both B. miyamotoi targets (purB and glpQ). Assuming at least one 
genome per spirochete, we would thus expect to consistently detect 
B. miyamotoi DNA in these samples down to five or fewer spiro-
chetes per reaction.
PCR results were analyzed using CFX Manager 3.1 soft-
ware (Bio-Rad, Hercules, CA) with the regression option selected 
for quantitation cycle (Cq) determination. Controls on each plate 
included a no-template control (elution buffer), DNA extracted from 
uninfected, colony-reared I. scapularis nymphs (Centers for Disease 
Control and Prevention, Fort Collins, CO), and recombinant plasmid 
DNA containing the purB and glpQ target sequences as previously 
described (Graham et al. 2016). Samples were considered positive 
if Cq values for both B. miyamotoi targets were ≤40. If we initially 
detected only one B. miyamotoi target in a sample, we repeated the 
PCR. This occurred only three times, and upon repeat, all three sam-
ples yielded corroborating results between the two targets.
Statistical Analyses and Mapping
Point estimates and confidence limits of infection prevalence were 
calculated based on maximum likelihood estimates (MLE) and score 
confidence intervals (Newcombe, 2012). Global Moran’s Index was 
used in spatial clustering analysis based on point estimates of the 
density of infected nymphs and was performed using ArcMap soft-
ware (ArcGIS v. 10.4, Redlands, CA). Logistic regression was used to 
assess the relationship between nymphal infection status and density 
of host-seeking nymphs among sites. A chi-squared test was used to 
determine whether co-infection of nymphs with B. miyamotoi and

 B. burgdorferi s.s. occurred as frequently as would be expected based 
on the probability that either agent by itself was infected. Logistic 
regression and chi-squared tests were performed using JMP 11.1.1 
(SAS Institute, Cary, NC). A homogeneous stratum effect (HSE) test 
(Zhao 2014) and individual McNemar’s tests, stratified by site, were 
used to evaluate any association of B. miyamotoi infection status 
with B. burgdorferi s.s. infections in ticks. Logistic regression was 
also used to analyze the relationship between B. miyamotoi preva-
lence and woodland type using Firth’s correction (Firth 1993). The 
HSE test, McNemar’s tests, and second logistic regression analysis 
were carried out in R (R Core Team 2017), with the latter using the 
‘brglm’ package. Maps were developed using ArcMap projected to 
TealAlbers zone 10 NAD 1927.
Results and Discussion
Consistent with previous studies assessing a large number of ticks 
collected across multiple geographic locations (Barbour et al. 2009, 
Crowder et al. 2014, Padgett et al. 2014), we found that B. miyamo-
toi is geographically widespread in Mendocino County, but occurs 
at low prevalence in host-seeking I. pacificus nymphs. Of the 3,255 
nymphs tested, 44 (1.4%; 95% CI: 1.0–1.8%) were PCR positive 
for B. miyamotoi. This overall infection prevalence of 1.4% for 
B. miyamotoi in I. pacificus nymphs is in remarkable agreement with 
previous studies testing ticks collected in southeastern Mendocino 
County (1.7%) (Mun et al. 2006) and statewide (1.4%) (Padgett 
et al. 2014), and is considerably lower than the prevalence of B. burg-
dorferi s.s. (average of 4.9%, range among sites 0–22%) previously 
reported for these host-seeking nymphal ticks (Eisen et al. 2010). We 
identified at least one B. miyamotoi-infected nymph from each of 24 
locations (30.4% of sites sampled) extending from the hot, dry oak-
woodland dominated southeastern corner of the county, to cooler 
and more humid conifer-dominated woodlands in the northeastern 
and northwestern parts of the county. Given the low infection preva-
lences observed, it is likely that B. miyamotoi is present at additional 
sites from which few ticks were available for testing. Notably, densi-
ties of host-seeking nymphs were low in coastal redwood, inland 
pine and Ponderosa pine dominated sites in the far western, and nor-
thern portions of the county resulting in wide confidence intervals 
(Fig. 1). Irrespective of tick abundance, risk for human exposure to 
B. miyamotoi is limited by the low prevalence of infection in ticks 
in these locations.
Site-specific MLE for infection prevalence ranged from 0 to 
10.5% (Fig. 1), and the MLE for density of infected nymphs col-
lected by dragging leaf-litter or fir-needle areas was less than 1 per 
100 m2 at all sites. There was no significant evidence of spatial clus-
tering of sites based on density of infected nymphs (Global Moran’s 
I., z = 1.47, P-value = 0.14), indicating that the risk of encounter-
ing nymphs infected with B. miyamotoi does not appear to be con-
centrated within geographical foci. The nymphs included in this 
study represent a subset of those that were screened previously for 
B. burgdorferi s.s. (Eisen et al. 2010), enabling direct comparisons 
of infection prevalence and spatial patterns of infection between 
B. burgdorferi s.s. and B. miyamotoi in host-seeking I. pacificus. 
Woodland type was not a significant predictor of B. miyamotoi 
prevalence (P-value = 0.52), nor was density of questing nymphs 
associated with B. miyamotoi infection status at these locations 
(P-value = 1.0). As with estimates of infection prevalence per site, 
it is possible that relationships between B. miyamotoi and environ-
mental factors could be obscured by the low infection prevalence 
in ticks. However, prevalence of B. burgdorferi s.s. in these nymphs 
was previously shown to vary significantly according to woodland 
type, and was also positively associated with density of host-seeking 
nymphs (Eisen et al. 2010). The results from Mendocino County 
align with those recently reported for I. ricinus, whereas in contrast 
to the Lyme disease spirochete Borrelia afzelii, B. miyamotoi preva-
lence in the same sample of nymphs was not associated with forest 
type (Ruyts et al. 2017).
Notably, only a single tick tested positive for both B. miy-
amotoi and B. burgdorferi s.s., which did not differ significantly 
(P-value = 0.43) from the number of co-infections expected based 
on prevalence of the two species independently. Individual tick infec-
tion status was significantly different statistically across sites, so sep-
arate McNemar’s tests analyzed the relationship of the two Borrelia 
species by site. Forty-five of 55 sites tested (23 sites did not have 
enough information for the test to run) failed to show a statistic-
ally significant relationship, suggesting that any potential interaction 
occurring between B. burgdorferi s.s. and B. miyamotoi is unlikely 
to influence infection status in ticks. These results correspond with a 
previous report where B. miyamotoi and B. burgdorferi s.s. occurred 
at frequencies independent of one another in I. scapularis (Barbour 
et al. 2009).
Such comparisons reiterate important questions previously 
raised regarding the transmission cycle of B. miyamotoi and in par-
ticular, why prevalence of this spirochete in nymphs is consistently 
lower than that of sympatric B. burgdorferi s.l. spirochetes, despite 
sharing common vectors and exposure to the same potential res-
ervoir hosts. One possibility is that in contrast to rodents infected 
with B. burgdorferi s.l. group spirochetes, which frequently exhibit 
prolonged or chronic periods of infectiousness (Brown and Lane 
1992, Richter et al. 2004, Hanincova et al. 2008, Salkeld et al. 
2008), a brief duration of active B. miyamotoi infection in rodents 
(Taylor et al. 2013, van Duijvendijk et al. 2016) may limit the tem-
poral window for naïve feeding ticks to acquire infection. Perhaps 
more importantly, the uniformly low prevalence of B. miyamotoi 
in ticks across different habitats and in the various vertebrate host 
communities they feed on in Mendocino County and elsewhere 
(Fukunaga et al. 1995, Bunikis and Barbour 2005, Scott et al. 2010, 
Hamer et al. 2012, Taylor et al. 2013, Burri et al. 2014, Szekeres 
et al. 2015, Wagemakers et al. 2017) suggests that the local com-
position of host species may not be a major factor influencing the 
prevalence of infection in ticks. It is possible that there may not be 
strong amplifying reservoir hosts for B. miyamotoi, and that enzo-
otic transmission involving most, or all hosts is inefficient. Moreover, 
acquisition of B. miyamotoi by uninfected ticks feeding on naturally 
infected hosts may be inefficient. Instead, transovarial transmission 
may play a more significant role than horizontal transmission in 
the perpetuation of B. miyamotoi. The lack of genotypic diversity 
among B. miyamotoi isolates may be further evidence of this. While 
it is established that vertebrate hosts drive genotypic diversity of 
B. burgdorferi s.l. and the geographic distribution of these genotypes 
(Kurtenbach et al. 2002, Brisson et al. 2004, Vollmer et al. 2011, 
Rudenko et al. 2014), the relative similarity among B. miyamotoi 
isolates suggests that host-mediated selection associated with hori-
zontal transmission is not occurring at a magnitude equal to that in 
B. burgdorferi s.l. Instead, vertical transmission of spirochetes from 
female ticks to their offspring, which holds little or no importance in 
natural maintenance of B. burgdorferi s.l. (Rollend et al. 2013), but 
is well-recognized in relapsing fever Borrelia species associated with 
soft ticks (Barbour 2005), is likely to be equally or more important 
than enzootic transmission to natural maintenance of B. miyamotoi. 
Among the studies where definitive confirmation of B. miyamotoi 
infection by PCR was available, as many as 73% (Scoles et al. 2001) 
of the progeny from a single I. scapularis female, and more than

 90% (Richter et al. 2012) of larvae from an unspecified number of 
I. ricinus females acquired infection via transovarial transmission. 
Future research should define the frequency of transovarial passage 
at a population level over several generations, assess the efficiency 
of this route in comparison to horizontal transmission, and further 
explore why B. miyamotoi is surprisingly scarce in nature, despite its 
ability to utilize multiple routes of transmission.
In summary, this study evaluated a large sample of I. pacificus 
nymphs collected from a single ecologically diverse Californian 
county for presence of B. miyamotoi. Our results support estimates 
from previous studies conducted at differing spatial scales in the 
region, and were presented in contrast to patterns of B. burgdorferi 
s.s. infection among the same group of ticks. Although B. miyamo-
toi is broadly distributed throughout Mendocino County across a 
variety of woodland types where I. pacificus is present, density of 
infected nymphs was consistently low due to low prevalence of infec-
tion in host-seeking nymphal ticks. Prevalence of B. miyamotoi in 
nymphs was not associated with any of the geographic or ecologic 
factors predictive of B. burgdorferi s.s. infection prevalence. Much 
about the natural history of B. miyamotoi remains to be explored, 
including the relative contributions of horizontal, transovarial, and 
co-feeding transmission to its natural maintenance.
