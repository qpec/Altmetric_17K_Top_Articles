Abstract
Objective—To study the association between bilateral oophorectomy and the rate of 
accumulation of multimorbidity.
Patients and Methods—In this historical cohort study, the Rochester Epidemiology Project 
records-linkage system was used to identify all premenopausal women who underwent bilateral 
oophorectomy before age 50 years between January 1, 1988, and December 31, 2007, in Olmsted 
County, Minnesota. Each woman was randomly matched to a referent woman born in the same 
year (± 1 year) who had not undergone bilateral oophorectomy. We studied the rate of 
accumulation of 18 common chronic conditions over a median of approximately 14 years of 
follow-up.
Results—Although women who underwent bilateral oophorectomy already had a higher 
multimorbidity burden at the time of oophorectomy, they also experienced a significantly 
increased risk of subsequent multimorbidity (P=.XX). After adjustments for 18 chronic conditions 
present at baseline, race/ethnicity, education, body mass index, smoking, age at baseline, and 
calendar year at baseline, women who underwent oophorectomy before age 46 years experienced 
an increased risk of depression, hyperlipidemia, cardiac arrhythmias, coronary artery disease, 
arthritis, asthma, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, and osteoporosis. In addition, they

 experienced an accelerated rate of accumulation of the 18 chronic conditions considered together 
(hazard ratio, 1.22; 95% CI, 1.14–1.31; P<.001). Several of these associations were reduced in 
women who received estrogen therapy.
Conclusion—Bilateral oophorectomy is associated with a higher risk of multimorbidity, even 
after adjustment for conditions present at baseline and for several possible confounders. However, 
several of these associations were reduced in women who received estrogen therapy.
This study was prompted by 2 important areas of uncertainty: the risk and benefits of 
bilateral oophorectomy for the prevention of ovarian cancer and the role of sex hormones in 
regulating the aging process. Our group 1–3 and others 4–6 have found that for most women 
without a cancer indication, the long-term risks of bilateral oophorectomy performed before 
menopause are greater than the benefits; therefore, the surgery should be limited to women 
who have a high-risk genetic variant predisposing the patient to cancer.3,5 However, other 
authors continue to argue that, in the absence of a randomized clinical trial, the evidence 
against prophylactic oophorectomy derived from observational studies is not sufficient to 
change the practice.7–10
Studies of the effects of sex steroids, in particular of estrogen, in regulating the aging 
process in humans have been hampered by the difficulty of measuring aging processes at the 
cellular, tissue, organ, or system level in vivo.11 Ferrucci and his team from the Intramural 
Research Program at the National Institute on Aging have suggested using the accumulation 
of multimorbidity as a proxy measure for accelerated aging.12–16
Using 18 aging-related chronic conditions, we addressed 2 major questions: (1) whether 
bilateral oophorectomy accelerates the accumulation of multimorbidity and (2) whether 
estrogen therapy (ET) modifies this accumulation.
PATIENTS AND METHODS
Bilateral Oophorectomy and Referent Cohorts
The Mayo Clinic Cohort Study of Oophorectomy and Aging-2 is a recently established 
population-based cohort study, completely independent from our previous work on this 
topic.1,2 We included a cohort of women who underwent bilateral oophorectomy and a 
cohort of age-matched referent women representative of a geographically defined 
population. All data collection was through the records-linkage system of the Rochester 
Epidemiology Project (REP) that has been described extensively elsewhere.17–20
We used the electronic index of the REP to identify women whose medical record included a 
code from the International Classification of Diseases, Ninth Revision (ICD-9) for either 
unilateral (65.3× and 65.4×) or bilateral (65.5× and 65.6×) oophorectomy between January 
1, 1988, and December 31, 2007. We included women who underwent bilateral 
oophorectomy or a second unilateral oophorectomy before the onset of menopause and 
before reaching the age of 50 years, regardless of concurrent or prior hysterectomy. 
Although hysterectomy is a cause of surgical menopause, women with prior hysterectomy 
were included because hysterectomy was not considered a cause of ovarian insufficiency. 
However, we excluded women who underwent oophorectomy for ovarian cancer (primary or

 metastatic), to treat another estrogen-sensitive malignant disorder (usually breast cancer), or 
because they had high genetic risk of cancer (eg, carriers of BRCA1 or BRCA2 variants).
For each woman included in the bilateral oophorectomy cohort, we defined the date of the 
surgical procedure as the index date, and we selected via simple random sampling a woman 
from the Olmsted County population who was born in the same year (±1 year) and had not 
undergone bilateral oophorectomy before the index date. All women who met these criteria 
were considered eligible regardless of menopausal status, any possible diseases or risk 
factors, and of prior hysterectomy or unilateral oophorectomy. The complete medical 
records of the women with oophorectomy and the referent women underwent extensive 
manual abstraction by a physician (L.G.-R.) or a trained study nurse to confirm the 
oophorectomy status and to obtain clinical data. Thus, the final classification of women was 
based on the findings from medical record review. Figure 1 presents detailed flowcharts for 
the 2 cohorts. All study procedures were approved by the institutional review boards of the 
Mayo Clinic and Olmsted Medical Center.
Baseline Conditions and Risk Factors
The complete medical records of women in both cohorts were manually abstracted for 
demographic, reproductive history, family history of cancer, and life habits information. In 
addition, the records were searched electronically for all ICD-9 codes entered by any health 
care institution participating in the REP before the index date to identify conditions that 
were already present at baseline. These ICD-9 codes were used to define the 20 chronic 
conditions recommended by the US Department of Health and Human Services (DHHS) to 
study multimorbidity.21–24 However, we excluded from the DHHS list human 
immunodeficiency virus infections, autism spectrum disorders, and hepatitis because they 
were rare in our population and were not considered related to the aging process, and we 
added anxiety to the DHHS list because it was common in our population and was 
considered related to the aging process (18 selected conditions).25 The condition labeled 
schizophrenia was retained because it included other psychoses that were common in the 
elderly population. To reduce the risk of false-positive diagnoses, only women whose 
medical record contained at least 2 diagnostic codes for a given condition separated by more 
than 30 days were considered to have that particular condition. For diagnostic codes entered 
before 1994, we required a 1-year separation because a finer dating of the codes in our 
system was impossible during that time frame.23–25
Outcome Conditions and Multimorbidity
For each woman, the diagnostic indices of the REP were also searched electronically for all 
ICD-9 codes entered into the medical record by any health care institution participating in 
the REP on or after the index date. In addition, we obtained death certificates for deceased 
women, and we considered all causes of death (underlying, intermediate, immediate, and 
other important conditions), as described elsewhere.1 Again, we used the ICD-9 codes to 
define 18 outcome conditions. We required 2 diagnostic codes as detailed previously; 
however, for women who died, one diagnostic code listed anywhere on the death certificate 
was sufficient. The time of onset of a given condition was the time when the second of the 2 
codes for the same condition was entered in the medical record (meeting the time gap

 criteria outlined previously) or the time of death if the condition was first diagnosed at the 
time of death.
Statistical Analyses
We estimated the hazard ratio (HR) for each of the 18 chronic conditions considered one at a 
time using Cox proportional hazards models with age as the time scale.26 Women who had a 
specific condition before the index year were excluded from that specific analysis (only de 
novo outcomes were counted). Women were censored at death, at the end of the study 
(December 31, 2014), or at the time of last contact with the system (lost to follow-up). We 
used robust sandwich covariance estimates to account for women who were included in both 
cohorts (referent women who underwent bilateral oophorectomy after the index date). The 
assumption of proportional hazards was assessed by graphical methods and by introducing a 
time-dependent coefficient in the Cox models.26 None of the models violated the 
proportional hazards assumption.
The accumulation of multimorbidity was represented graphically using Aalen-Johansen 
curves (a multistate generalization of cumulative incidence curves; unadjusted curves 
considering all 18 conditions equally). We also computed HRs using Andersen-Gill 
regression models with age as the time scale.26–28 None of the models violated the 
proportional hazards assumption. For a visual comparison of the accumulation of 
multimorbidity both before and after the index date, the graphs also illustrate the 
accumulation of multimorbidity in the 10 years preceding the index date. However, the data 
before the index date were not included in the calculation of the HRs.
In each analysis (for the 18 conditions separately and for the accumulation of conditions), 
we calculated unadjusted HRs and HRs adjusted using inverse probability weights derived 
from a logistic regression model including all 18 chronic conditions present at baseline, 
years of education (0–12, 13–16, and >16 years), race/ethnicity (white vs other), body mass 
index (calculated as weight in kilograms divided by height in meters squared; <30 vs ≥30 
kg/m2), cigarette smoking (current or former vs never), age at baseline (continuous), and 
calendar year at baseline (continuous). We used inverse probability weights to balance the 
oophorectomy and referent cohorts at baseline on potential confounders, and we assessed the 
balance obtained using the standardized difference of means (absolute value).29,30
Analyses were conducted overall and in strata defined by age at surgery (≤45 vs 46–49 
years), by surgical indication (benign ovarian condition vs no ovarian indication), and by 
postoophorectomy oral or transdermal ET (within age strata; through the 46th birthday vs 
discontinued before age 46 years; or through the 50th birthday vs discontinued before age 50 
years).1,2 Extensive details about the type and duration of ET were abstracted manually from 
drug prescriptions and clinical notes. Adjustments using inverse probability weights were 
performed separately for each stratum to ensure balance of characteristics at baseline.
We performed 3 sets of sensitivity analyses in which (1) we censored at the time of bilateral 
oophorectomy referent women who underwent bilateral oophorectomy after the index date 
but before age 50 years, (2) we removed all women who had any of the 18 conditions at 
baseline, and (3) we removed women who had undergone hysterectomy before the index

 date (in both cohorts) or had reached menopause before the index date (only for referent 
women). Finally, in a set of secondary analyses, we compared women who underwent 
bilateral oophorectomy (with prior or concurrent hysterectomy) to women who underwent 
hysterectomy with ovarian conservation in the time period 1988–2002 (time frame of 
overlap of the 2 cohorts). The women who underwent hysterectomy with ovarian 
conservation were derived from a separate cohort study described elsewhere.31 All analyses 
were completed using SAS statistical software version 9.4 (SAS Institute) and R statistical 
software version 3.1.1 (R Foundation for Statistical Computing), and tests of statistical 
significance were conducted at the 2-tailed α level of .05.
RESULTS
Study Sample
The median follow-up was 14.5 years (interquartile interval, 10.3–19.1) for the 1653 women 
who underwent bilateral oophorectomy and 14.4 years (interquartile interval, 10.4–19.3; P=.
87) for the 1653 referent women. Women who underwent bilateral oophorectomy were less 
educated, were more frequently white, had higher body mass index, and had smoked more 
pack-years of cigarettes than referent women at the time of bilateral oophorectomy (or index 
date; Supplemental Table 1, available online at http://www.mayoclinicproceedings.org). In 
case-control analyses comparing the 18 chronic conditions present at the time of 
oophorectomy or the index date, women who underwent bilateral oophorectomy were more 
likely to have previous diagnoses of depression, anxiety, substance abuse disorders, 
hyperlipidemia, hypertension, diabetes, cardiac arrhythmias, asthma, and chronic obstructive 
pulmonary disease. In addition, bilateral oophorectomy was associated with an increased 
number of preceding chronic conditions (Supplemental Table 2, available online at http://
www.mayoclinicproceedings.org).
In each of our adjusted analyses, we used inverse probability weighting to balance the 
oophorectomy and referent cohorts on these risk factors and chronic conditions at index 
date, thus minimizing their effects as potential confounders. Supplemental Figure 1 
illustrates the degree of adjustment obtained using inverse probability weights overall and in 
women who underwent bilateral oophorectomy at age 45 years or younger. In summary, the 
2 cohorts were not highly imbalanced before the adjustments (standardized difference of 
means <25% of the SD for most variables), and the adjustments improved the balance 
successfully (standardized difference of means <5% of the SD).29
Cumulative Incidence of the 18 Conditions Considered Separately
Our primary cohort analyses for the 18 chronic conditions considered separately are 
presented in Supplemental Tables 3 (mental health conditions), 4 (cardiovascular and 
metabolic conditions), and 5 (other somatic conditions) (available online at http://
www.mayoclinicproceedings.org) overall and in strata by age at oophorectomy, by 
indication, and by ET (within age strata). The key findings are also represented graphically 
in Figure 2. In overall adjusted analyses, we observed significant associations between 
bilateral oophorectomy and de novo diagnoses of 7 of the 18 conditions: depression, anxiety, 
hyperlipidemia, diabetes, arthritis, asthma, and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (HRs

 ranging between 1.19 and 1.43). In adjusted analyses restricted to women who underwent 
bilateral oophorectomy at age 45 years or younger, we observed an increased risk for all of 
the 18 conditions except cancer; however, the increased risk was significant only for 8 of the 
18 conditions: depression, hyperlipidemia, cardiac arrhythmias, coronary artery disease, 
arthritis, asthma, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, and osteoporosis (HRs ranging 
between 1.23 and 2.08). Finally, in adjusted analyses restricted to women who underwent 
bilateral oophorectomy at age 46 to 49 years, we observed significantly increased risk for 6 
of the 18 conditions: depression, anxiety, hyperlipidemia, diabetes, arthritis, and cancer 
(HRs ranging between 1.24 and 1.53) and significantly reduced risk for congestive heart 
failure.
Interaction Analyses for Individual Conditions
In analyses of interaction by age, women who underwent bilateral oophorectomy at age 45 
years or younger had significantly higher risk of coronary artery disease, congestive heart 
failure, and osteoporosis compared with women in the 46- to 49-year age stratum; however, 
they experienced a significantly lower risk of cancer (of all types). In analyses of interaction 
by ET, women in the younger age stratum who received ET through the target age (>45 
years) experienced a significantly reduced risk of osteoporosis compared to women who did 
not receive ET. Finally, in analyses of interaction by surgical indication, women who 
underwent oophorectomy because of a benign ovarian condition experienced a significantly 
higher risk of coronary artery disease, congestive heart failure, and chronic obstructive 
pulmonary disease compared to women with no ovarian indication (see footnotes in 
Supplemental Tables 3–5).
Accumulation of Multimorbidity
Although women who underwent bilateral oophorectomy already had a higher mean number 
of conditions at baseline, they experienced an accelerated accumulation of multimorbidity 
after the surgery (Table, Figures 3 and 4). In each of the 3 panels in Figure 3, the curve for 
the referent women increased smoothly with age, whereas the curve for the oophorectomy 
cohort showed a slight jump up shortly after the index date and continued to diverge 
thereafter.
Interaction Analyses for Accumulation of Multimorbidity
In our primary analyses presented in Figure 4, women who underwent oophorectomy at 
younger ages had a higher risk of accumulation of multimorbidity; however, the strata by 
age were not significantly different. Women who underwent oophorectomy at younger ages 
and received ET had a reduced association; however, the strata by ET were not significantly 
different either among women who underwent bilateral oophorectomy at age 45 years or 
younger or at age 46 to 49 years. There was also no significant difference between strata for 
surgical indication, calendar year period, or cigarette smoking (Table).
Sensitivity Analyses
The rate of accumulation remained similar in all 3 sets of sensitivity analyses reported in the 
Table: the first in which the 84 referent women who underwent bilateral oophorectomy after

 the index date but before age 50 years were censored; the second restricted to women who 
did not have any of the 18 conditions at baseline; and the third restricted to women who had 
not undergone hysterectomy (in both cohorts) or natural or medically induced menopause 
(only referent women) before the index date. In addition, none of the tests for interaction by 
age at oophorectomy, ET, or surgical indication yielded significant results in the 3 sets of 
sensitivity analyses (see footnotes in the Table). Finally, the secondary analyses comparing 
women who underwent bilateral oophorectomy to women who underwent hysterectomy 
with ovarian conservation derived from a separate cohort yielded an adjusted HR of 1.09 
(95% CI, 1.03–1.16; P=.004) for the overall group and 1.08 (95% CI, 1.01–1.16; P=.02) for 
women who underwent oophorectomy at age ≤45 years or younger (data not shown).
DISCUSSION
Principal Findings
In our study, women who underwent bilateral oophorectomy before menopause experienced 
a higher risk for 7 of the 18 chronic conditions under study and an accelerated accumulation 
of multimorbidity. Most of the associations with individual conditions were stronger in 
women who underwent bilateral oophorectomy at younger ages, and several of the 
associations were reduced in women who received ET in the younger age stratum. Similarly, 
the rate of accumulation of multimorbidity was higher in the younger stratum and was 
reduced in women who received ET in the younger age stratum. However, the statistical 
power was limited for several of the interaction analyses. Some of the findings that did not 
reach statistical significance in our analyses may reach significance with longer follow-up of 
our cohorts (current follow-up was approximately 14 years).
Possible Explanations for the Findings
We propose 3 possible mechanisms to explain the observed associations. First, our findings 
may reflect confounding by shared genetic predisposition or shared social or environmental 
risk factors. Genetic variants or risk factors may increase the risk of gynecologic diseases 
prompting the oophorectomy (eg, ovarian cysts or endometriosis) or prompting 
hysterectomy accompanied by oophorectomy (eg, uterine fibroids).32,33 These same genetic 
variants or risk factors may also independently increase the risk of multimorbidity34 or 
accelerated aging.11 However, our analyses for the accumulation of multimorbidity stratified 
in women with or without a benign ovarian indication did not reveal a significant interaction. 
In addition, our primary analyses adjusted for the 18 conditions present at baseline using 
inverse probability weights, and our sensitivity analyses restricted to women free of any 
condition at baseline do not support a confounding mechanism. We used inverse probability 
weights to balance the oophorectomy and the referent cohorts at baseline on potential 
confounders. These methods are a powerful way to bring observational studies closer in 
interpretation to randomized clinical trials when the exposure (in our case, bilateral 
oophorectomy) cannot be ethically or feasibly randomized.29,30
Second, our findings may suggest that the premature and abrupt loss of estrogen negatively 
affects multiple fundamental aging mechanisms, leading to harmful effects in multiple cells, 
tissues, organs, and systems (accelerated aging). Levine et al11 recently reported an

 association between bilateral oophorectomy and a newly proposed biomarker of aging, the 
“epigenetic clock,” in DNA derived from blood and saliva. Although further work is needed, 
they concluded that the premature loss of ovarian function may lead to an increase in 
epigenetic age, a biological marker of accelerated aging. Supplemental Figure 2 (available 
online at http://www.mayoclinicproceedings.org) illustrates our overall mechanistic 
hypothesis linking premature estrogen loss caused by the oophorectomy to the accelerated 
accumulation of multimorbidity used as a clinical proxy measure for accelerated 
aging.12,15,16 Some conditions may be affected by estrogen loss more severely or earlier in 
life than others. Unfortunately, there is no consensus about how many conditions or clusters 
of conditions or what severity of conditions are needed to define accelerated aging and to 
separate low or moderate accelerated aging. The greater rate of accumulation of chronic 
conditions with younger age at oophorectomy suggests that the hypothesized protective 
effects of estrogen may be age dependent and may have a critical age window (timing 
hypothesis), as already suggested for cardiovascular and neurologic diseases.1,2,35–39 In 
support of the role of estrogen, women who underwent bilateral oophorectomy at age 45 
years or younger and received ET through the target age experienced a significant 
attenuation of the risk for osteoporosis compared to women who did not receive ET. 
However, we did not detect a significant interaction by ET for other outcomes such as 
hyperlipidemia or diabetes. Finally, we did not find any significant interaction with ET in 
analyses for the accumulation of multimorbidity. The failure to show significant interactions 
by ET may be due to limited statistical power, to the variable effect of ET across the chronic 
conditions, or to the dose and formulation of ET.
A large body of literature from animal experiments supports the detrimental effects of 
oophorectomy on several aging processes and on the life span. Bilateral removal of the 
ovaries in young animals (ovariectomy) is the conventional experimental intervention used 
to study the effects of premature estrogen deprivation in accelerating the aging of specific 
tissues or organs (eg, heart, brain, bone) and to study the possible opposing effect of 
hormonal treatment as a replacement intervention. By contrast, transplant of ovaries from 
young mice into old mice was reported to significantly increase life span.40 Only a few 
selected studies focusing on nonhuman primates are mentioned here because they may be 
more relevant to women. A number of studies found an acceleration of vascular 
degeneration following ovariectomy in monkeys.36,37 Other studies reported an acceleration 
of brain degeneration following ovariectomy in rodents and monkeys.38,39 Unfortunately, we 
are not aware of studies linking ovariectomy to reduced life span in monkeys; however, 
studies in dogs and mice revealed a reduction in life span following ovariectomy.41,42
Third, our findings may suggest either protective effects of ovarian hormones other than 
estrogen (eg, progesterone, testosterone, or inhibin) or harmful effects of the disruption of 
the hypothalamus-pituitary-ovarian axis caused by bilateral oophorectomy (increased release 
of follicle-stimulating hormone and luteinizing hormone). However, the possible effects of 
these hormones on the cellular processes associated with aging remain unknown.34

 Strengths and Limitations
Some methodological features distinguish this study from several previous studies that 
addressed related questions.4–6,8 First, information about menopause timing and type, risk 
factors present at baseline, and the use of estrogen or other hormones during follow-up was 
abstracted manually from the medical records included in a records-linkage system. 
Similarly, the 18 conditions used to define the baseline and the outcome conditions were 
extracted electronically from the REP indexes, without direct involvement of the study 
patients, thus avoiding recall bias.
Second, because the women were followed #up immediately after the oophorectomy or the 
index year, there was no time gap between the oophorectomy and the recruitment into the 
study. Third, because the data collection was historical, women did not need to provide a 
study-specific informed consent but only a general consent to use their medical records for 
research (Minnesota legal requirements).17 Therefore, nonparticipation was minimal at 
baseline and during follow-up.
Fourth, our referent women comprised a population-based sample without restrictions. Other 
studies compared clinical series of women who underwent bilateral oophorectomy 
concurrent with hysterectomy to women who underwent hysterectomy with ovarian 
conservation.4,5 We avoided using hysterectomy with ovarian conservation as a referent 
group because hysterectomy itself may modify the risk of morbidity and mortality.6,43 
However, for comparison with other studies, we conducted a set of secondary analyses 
comparing women who underwent bilateral oophorectomy (with prior or concurrent 
hysterectomy) to women who underwent hysterectomy with ovarian conservation. As 
expected, the associations were attenuated but remained significant, suggesting that both the 
hysterectomy and the oophorectomy may contribute to the increased risk.
Our study has limitations that should be considered. First, we may have underestimated the 
rates of certain conditions that are asymptomatic or do not uniformly come to medical 
attention. Second, the ICD-9 codes used to define the baseline and the outcome conditions 
were assigned during the course of routine medical care and are subject to misclassification. 
We attempted to reduce the risk of false-positive diagnoses by including only those patients 
who had at least 2 codes in their medical record for a given condition separated by more 
than 30 days, as used in other studies.23,44 Third, we cannot exclude some level of 
surveillance bias if the women who underwent oophorectomy had more frequent contacts 
with the medical facilities after the index date.45 Conversely, the density of contacts with the 
medical facilities in Olmsted County is high for women older than age 40 years, regardless 
of their oophorectomy status.17
Fourth, the oophorectomies used to define our historical cohorts took place over 20 years, 
and surgical and estrogen prescribing practices have changed over time. However, we did 
not observe any significant difference in the rate of accumulation of multimorbidity for 
women who underwent bilateral oophorectomy in the 1988 to 1997 vs the 1998 to 2007 
decades. Fifth, we cannot exclude that some unmeasured variables (eg, income) may have 
caused residual confounding or that some of the findings for the 18 conditions considered 
separately may have been due to chance.

 Finally, the statistical power was limited for some of the stratified analyses and for some of 
the tests for interaction. In addition, there were a number of methodological limitations that 
could not be addressed in the current sample. We plan to continue to follow up our cohorts 
and to accumulate additional outcome conditions so that more complex analyses will be 
possible to address issues such as the clustering of chronic conditions, the severity and 
duration of conditions, and specific types of cancer. This report is a first step toward 
understanding the complex effects of bilateral oophorectomy on multimorbidity, but many 
questions remain partly unanswered.
CONCLUSION
Our study findings suggest that bilateral oophorectomy is associated with an accelerated 
accumulation of multimorbidity defined using a set of 18 chronic conditions, even after 
adjusting for these same 18 conditions present at baseline and for several possible 
confounders. However, several of the associations were reduced in women who received 
estrogen therapy. It has been suggested that the accumulation of multimorbidity may be a 
clinical proxy measure for accelerated aging. Our findings have both scientific and public 
health implications. The findings from our study, combined with those from several 
important preceding studies, provide more definitive evidence against the use of bilateral 
oophorectomy for the prevention of ovarian cancer in most premenopausal women who are 
at average risk of ovarian cancer. Although numerous professional societies worldwide have 
issued guidelines discouraging the practice of prophylactic bilateral oophorectomy in most 
women, the practice continues. In addition, our findings emphasize the importance of 
considering aging in a broader perspective, including multiple cellular, tissue, organ, and 
system levels, and of using multimorbidity as a clinical manifestation of these underlying 
complex aging mechanisms. Finally, this study should prompt additional research at the 
laboratory and clinical level to clarify the role of estrogen and other ovarian hormones in 
regulating the aging process in women.

 FIGURE 1. 
Flowchart of the 2 study cohorts. The oophorectomy cohort was selected by medical record 
review. The referent cohort was selected via simple random sampling of women from the 
Olmsted County population who were born in the same year (±1 year) as women in the 
oophorectomy cohort and had not undergone bilateral oophorectomy. A total of 72 women 
with unilateral oophorectomy had subsequent removal of their remaining ovary before age 
50 years in 1988 to 2007 and were included in the bilateral oophorectomy cohort. Survivors 
were followed up to the most recent contact with the system or the end of the study 
(December 31,2014). Causes of death were available for 57 of 64 women with bilateral 
oophorectomy and for 54 of 60 referent women. These women did not receive care within 
the system during the last 3 years of study (January 1, 2012, through December 31, 2014) 
and were censored at the last recorded contact.

Adjusted hazard ratios and 95% CIs for each of the 18 chronic conditions considered 
separately. Analyses are presented as overall (black diamonds) and in strata by age at 
oophorectomy (red circles for age ≤45 years and blue squares for age 46–49 years). The 
hazard ratios were calculated using Cox proportional hazards models with age as the time 
scale and were adjusted for the 18 conditions present at index date, for education, race/
ethnicity, body mass index, cigarette smoking, and age, and for calendar year using inverse 
probability weights.

Accumulation of multimorbidity. The accumulation of chronic conditions is shown as the 
mean number of conditions over follow-up time (cumulative incidence; Aalen-Johansen

curves are unadjusted; however, the hazard ratios (HR) in the panels were adjusted using 
inverse probability weights. The shaded area of each graph (events after the index date) 
illustrates the data collected prospectively in our study and used to calculate the HR. The

 the data were obtained retrospectively for the women sampled at the index date. The amount 
of data available retrospectively before the index date varied across women. In all 3 panels, 
the curve for women who underwent bilateral oophorectomy showed a jump up shortly after 
the index date (blue arrow) and continued to diverge thereafter.

Adjusted hazard ratios and 95% CIs for the accumulation of multimorbidity (18 chronic 
conditions combined). Analyses are presented as overall (black diamonds) and in strata by 
age at oophorectomy (red circles and blue squares), by estrogen treatment within age at 
oophorectomy strata (solid lines for treated women and dashed lines for untreated women), 
by surgical indication, by calendar year period, and by cigarette smoking status at index 
date. The hazard ratios were calculated using Andersen-Gill regression models with age as 
the time scale and were adjusted for the 18 conditions present at the index date for 
education, race/ethnicity, body mass index, cigarette smoking, and age, and for calendar year 
using inverse probability weights.

aHazard ratios calculated using Andersen-Gill regression models with age as the time scale and adjusted using inverse probability weights derived from a regression model including all 18 chronic 
conditions present at baseline, years of education (≤ 12, 13–16, > 16), race (white vs nonwhite), body mass index (<30 vs ≥30 kg/m2), cigarette smoking (current or former vs never), age at baseline 
(continuous), and calendar year at baseline (continuous). These adjustments were performed separately in each stratum to maximize the balance at baseline. None of the interactions by age was significant.
bWomen who were taking ET on their 46th birthday, after bilateral oophorectomy (only oral or transdermal). Women who had the particular outcome disease before their 46th birthday, died or were lost to 
follow-up before their 46th birthday, or had not reached age 46 years as of December 31, 2014, were not included in the corresponding analysis. Follow-up for these analyses was started at age 46 years. 
None of the interactions by ET was significant in the ≤45-years age stratum.
cWomen who were taking ET on their 50th birthday, after bilateral oophorectomy (only oral or transdermal). Women who had the particular outcome disease before their 50th birthday, died or were lost to 
follow-up before their 50th birthday, or had not reached age 50 years as of December 31, 2014, were not included in the corresponding analysis. Follow-up for these analyses was started at age 50 years. 
None of the interactions by ET was significant in the 46–49 years age stratum.
dThe benign condition (eg, cysts or endometriosis) was listed by the gynecologist in the medical record at the time of oophorectomy. However, some of these indications are questionable from our current 
perspective. None of the interactions by surgical indication was significant.
eWomen without a malignant or benign ovarian condition. Historically, the terms prophylactic, elective, or incidental oophorectomy were used; however, we avoided these terms.
fThis sensitivity analysis was an alternative way of dealing with referent women who shifted their status from unexposed to exposed during follow-up.
gThis sensitivity analysis was an alternative method used to reduce confounding caused by the 18 chronic conditions preceding the index date. Analyses were still adjusted for the other potential 
confounders using inverse probability weighting.

hThis sensitivity analysis addressed the possible confounding effect of hysterectomy with ovarian conservation preceding the index date or of menopause before the index date (only applicable to referent 
women).
