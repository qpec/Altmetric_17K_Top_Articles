Abstract
Background: Advances in early diagnosis and curative treatment have reduced high 
mortality rates associated with non‐small cell lung cancer. However, racial disparity 
in survival persists partly because Black patients receive less curative treatment than 
White patients.
Methods: We performed a 5‐year pragmatic, trial at five cancer centers using a sys-
tem‐based intervention. Patients diagnosed with early stage lung cancer, aged 18‐85 
were eligible. Intervention components included: (1) a real‐time warning system de-
rived from electronic health records, (2) race‐specific feedback to clinical teams on 
treatment completion rates, and (3) a nurse navigator. Consented patients were com-
pared to retrospective and concurrent controls. The primary outcome was receipt of 
curative treatment.
Results: There were 2841 early stage lung cancer patients (16% Black) in the retro-
spective group and 360 (32% Black) in the intervention group. For the retrospective 
baseline, crude treatment rates were 78% for White patients vs 69% for Black pa-
tients (P < 0.001); difference by race was confirmed by a model adjusted for age, 
treatment site, cancer stage, gender, comorbid illness, and income‐odds ratio (OR) 
0.66 for Black patients (95% CI 0.51‐0.85, P = 0.001). Within the intervention co-
hort, the crude rate was 96.5% for Black vs 95% for White patients (P = 0.56). Odds 
ratio for the adjusted analysis was 2.1 (95% CI 0.41‐10.4, P = 0.39) for Black vs 
White patients. Between group analyses confirmed treatment parity for the 
intervention.
Conclusion: A system‐based intervention tested in five cancer centers reduced racial 
gaps and improved care for all.

INTRODUCTION
Untreated, early stage, non‐small cell lung cancer is nearly 
always fatal within 4 years of diagnosis.1 Lung resection sur-
gery remains the recommended treatment for cure although 
stereotactic radiation has been deemed acceptable for a se-
lect group of patients.2 Despite the high mortality and pro-
gressive physical limitations that decisions against treatment 
portend,1,3 Black patients undergo surgery less often than 
similar White patients. Studies spanning decades1,4-7 show 
persistence of surgical disparities with similar gaps emerging 
for radiation.8
The reasons for cancer treatment disparities go beyond 
socioeconomic status, age, and health status.1,4,5,9,10 Lathan 
et al specifically showed that clinician decision making was 
a greater contributor to lower surgical rates for Black pa-
tients than refusal of surgery.4 Alternatively, absolute sur-
gical contraindications were the predominant factors that 
reduced surgeries for White patients.4 In a recent prospec-
tive study, investigators linked lower surgical rates for all 
patients regardless of race to negative perceptions of com-
munication and fears that surgery would lead to poor func-
tional status. When considering only Black patients, this 
study found that lack of a regular source of care was asso-
ciated with lower surgical rates suggesting that Black pa-
tients, possibly experiencing denial or mistrust, were more 
likely lost to follow‐up. Notably, Black patients with two 
or more comorbidities (eg, renal insufficiency and insulin‐
dependent diabetes) rarely received surgery while similar 
White patients often did. The comorbidity issue suggests an 
implicit bias; clinicians were less willing to tolerate higher 
risk in treatment decisions affecting racially discordant 
patients.5 Despite the preponderance of observational ev-
idence, there is nearly a complete absence of prospective 
trials to close these gaps.
For the purpose of considering plausible interventions, 
these disparities were discussed with the Greensboro Health 
Disparities Collaborative (GHDC), an academic‐commu-
nity partnership experienced in community‐based partici-
patory research (CBPR).11,12 GHDC is a diverse group by 
race, ethnicity, profession, religion, and neighborhood of 
residence. Using CBPR principles, GHDC recommended 
using a multifaceted intervention encompassing elements 
of real‐time transparency, race‐specific accountability, and 
enhanced, patient‐centered communication. In this report, 
we describe a prospective, pragmatic, trial built on these 
principles.

METHODS
This study includes subjects enrolled in two multi‐insti-
tutional prospective trials using identical interventions. A 
total of 238 patients were enrolled in the American Cancer 
Society (ACS)‐sponsored study, Lung Cancer Surgery: 
Decisions against Life Saving Care—The Intervention 
(RSG‐05‐217‐05‐CPPB: PI Cykert). The study sites for 
the ACS work were cancer centers affiliated with the 
University of North Carolina, East Carolina University, 
and the University of South Carolina. The Accountability 
for Cancer Care through Undoing Racism and Equity 
(ACCURE) study was sponsored by the National Cancer 
Institute (Grant # 1R01CA150980‐01A1: PI, Eng & 
Cykert). The ACCURE study applied the intervention to 
breast and lung cancer patients. The 122 lung cancer pa-
tients enrolled in ACCURE were included. Participating 
sites for ACCURE were the University of Pittsburgh 
Medical Center's Hillman Cancer Center (UPMC) and 
Cone Health Cancer Center in Greensboro, North Carolina 
(Cone). Given the comparability of the system‐based inter-
vention designs, we provide the following descriptions as if 
applicable to a single trial. Note that both trials were reg-
istered with ClinicalTrials.gov (ACCURE, NCT01954641; 
ACS, NCT01687738).
2.1 | Study design and intervention
We performed a 5‐year study to examine the effect of an 
intervention to reduce disparities in treatment received by 
Black patients with stages I and II lung cancer. Our study 
was a pragmatic trial according to the PRECIS‐2 definition13; 
specifically, the patients were community based with broad 
enrollment criteria, treated by usual care providers in a typi-
cal cancer care setting using tools and personnel that fit into 
routine clinic workflows. The study was approved by the 
governing institutional review board of each enrollment site.
All consented patients received the intervention which 
consisted of (1) a real‐time warning system derived from au-
tomated uploads from electronic health records (EHRs), (2) 
feedback to clinical teams on completion of cancer treatments 
according to race, and (3) a nurse navigator who accessed the 
warning system on a daily basis.
Because of the ubiquitous nature of EHRs and the perva-
siveness of quality improvement (QI) techniques in practice, 
we felt it was unethical to randomize patients to a control 
group devoid of data feedback and electronic tools. We

instead applied audit and feedback to consented patients and 
established two statistical, whole population control groups 
without consented patients. The first included all patients 
diagnosed with stages I and II non‐small cell lung cancer 
from the five participating institutions from January 1, 2007 
to December 31, 2012 and was used to establish baseline 
treatment rates and racial differences. The second group was 
comprised of the concurrent population of stage I and II lung 
cancer patients at two institutions, UPMC and Cone, diag-
nosed in 2014 and 2015 who were seen in the intervention 
period but not consented for the study. UPMC and Cone were 
chosen as the concurrent sample because their informatics 
teams were willing to establish automated data feeds for 
non‐study participants as long as the data sets were devoid 
of personal identifiers. The concurrent group ensured that 
improvement, if seen in the intervention, would not repre-
sent improvement attributable to secular trends. Variables 
collected for all groups included gender, age, race, health 
insurance status, zip code, cancer stage at diagnosis, and co-
morbid illnesses. As care progressed, we recorded whether 
patients received surgery or stereotactic radiation and dates 
of all treatments.
Regarding the real‐time registry, we received automated 
nightly uploads of EHR data for consented patients’ in-
cluding appointments for clinician visits, tests, treatments, 
and procedures. One institution was unable to program 
automated uploads so a research assistant (RA) updated 
the registry by hand daily after reviewing the EHR. The 
registry was programmed to deliver alerts when a patient 
either missed a scheduled appointment or did not reach an 
expected milestone in care. The milestones were no fol-
low‐up scheduled within 30 days of the initial visit, no sur-
gery or radiation scheduled within 90 days, and no surgery 
performed or radiation received within 120 days. The real‐
time system was a secure, web‐based umbrella system ac-
cessed by the navigator on at least a daily basis. Warnings 
were delivered to the navigators face page and notations 
for resolution had to be made within the system. Missed 
appointments were handled directly by the navigator who 
would re‐engage the patient then identify and resolve bar-
riers to care whether these were logistical, such as a lack 
of transportation or difficult finances, or perception‐based, 
such as mistrust, barrier beliefs (eg, prayer alone can cure 
disease or surgery makes the disease spread), or miscom-
munication. Since milestone warnings related more to 
treatment decisions or clinical inertia, the navigator re-
ferred these to the physician champion who engaged the 
clinical team and discussed possible remedies. Although 
access to the registry system was limited by site, the ap-
pearance of warnings, the workflow, and the recording of 
warning resolutions was uniform. To monitor intervention 
fidelity, all warnings and navigator responses were logged 
within the registry system.
For each cancer center, a practicing oncologist served as 
a physician champion. The champion made other clinicians 
and staff aware of the study during usual meetings and, in 
addition to the milestone warnings above, was responsible for 
delivering quarterly treatment reports for the cancer center 
population stratified by race.
2.2 | Patient enrollment
Black and White patients with newly diagnosed stage I and 
II lung cancer between the ages of 18 and 85 were eligible. 
Exclusions included pregnancy, inability to speak English, 
and cognitive impairment. Enrollment spanned April 2013 
until December 2016. Our goal was to recruit consecutive 
patients at the participating centers as quickly as possible so 
that everyone experienced at least 1 year of follow‐up. To 
identify eligible patients, RA‐screened patient schedules 
from thoracic surgery, oncology, pulmonary, and multi-
disciplinary cancer clinics. These schedules were available 
through the EHR. Most patients screened were ineligible be-
cause of a non‐cancer diagnosis, follow‐up for an established 
diagnosis, a cancer diagnosis other than lung, or stage >2. 
Figure 1 shows a schematic representation of enrollment and 
progression through the study. The top row shows the num-
ber of eligible patients identified by race and those refusing 
consent. When eligible patients shared simultaneous appoint-
ment times, RA's were trained to prioritize Black patients as a 
method of oversampling. Informed consent was given by all 
participants at all sites.
2.3 | Primary outcome
The primary outcome was receipt of potentially curative treat-
ment (surgical resection or stereotactic radiation); both treat-
ments are superior to no treatment and some reports suggest 
comparable overall survival.14,15 However, since some pro-
pensity‐matched comparisons of stereotactic radiation to sur-
gery suggest better outcomes for surgery,16-18 we evaluated the 
intervention effect on surgery alone as a secondary outcome. 
We also examined the use of radiation alone as high rates of 
radiation exclusive of surgery could suggest inferior care.
2.4 | Statistical analysis
Patient characteristics including gender, age, median house-
hold income by zip code, race, clinical stage, and Charlson 
score were summarized using descriptive statistics and 
compared across study groups and within study groups 
between races using chi‐square and F‐tests for categorical 
and continuous variables, respectively. Separate analyses 
were performed for the primary outcome (receipt of ste-
reotactic radiation or surgery) and the secondary outcome 
(receipt of surgery). Since we were interested in estimating 
 1098 |   
CYKERT ET al.
treatment differences between Black and White patients 
within each study group, a logistic regression model was 
performed for each outcome examining Black compared 
to White outcomes within each group while controlling for 
age, income, gender, comorbidities, clinical stage, and site. 
Because most lung cancer patients were over 65 years old, 
nearly all study patients had health insurance, so the insur-
ance variable was not entered into models. The retrospec-
tive data were used to define baseline treatment rates and 
the baseline disparity between Black and White patients. 
Concurrent data were used to follow the disparity during 
the intervention period to assess secular trends for non‐en-
rolled patients. For the between group analysis, to control 
for differences across the three study groups, all data from 
each group of interest were placed into a single model and 
study group by race combinations were employed to esti-
mate differences by race and group. Similar logistic regres-
sion models were otherwise constructed to those used for 
within group analyses. As such, we combined and com-
pared estimates of racial differences between baseline (ret-
rospective) and intervention and between concurrent and 
intervention groups.

and 16% were Black. Of the 407 patients, 360 originally con-
sented completed the intervention (32% Black). Forty‐seven 
patients were withdrawn (Figure 1); 14 had advanced disease 
after further staging; 11 died prior to treatment; 9 had be-
nign biopsy findings; 9 withdrew consent; and 4 were lost to 
follow‐up. The concurrent control had 597 patients and 13% 
were Black. Table 1 compares study characteristics among 
the three groups. Given that the main focus of the study was 
to examine whether the intervention mitigated Black‐White 
treatment disparities, demographic comparisons between 
Black and White patients who were in the intervention group 
are shown in Table 2. Note that patients are well matched in 
all demographic categories except Black patients, on aver-
age, were younger and had a lower income than their White 
counterparts.
Descriptive analyses were performed for all treatment 
outcomes. Note the overall treatment rate for surgery or radi-
ation for cure, regardless of race, was 76% in the retrospec-
tive group, 96% in the intervention group, and 83% in the 
concurrent group (all comparisons P < 0.001). Differences 
in surgical treatment also favored the intervention group 
with a rate of 62% in the retrospective group compared to 
76% in the intervention, and 50% in the concurrent group 
(P < 0.001). For Black patients alone, the overall treatment 
rate was 69% in the retrospective group, 96% in the inter-
vention group, and 79% in the concurrent group. These per-
centages for White patients followed the same pattern of 
improvement—78%, 96%, and 84%, respectively. Notably, 
the radiation only rates in the intervention group were al-
most identical, 19.1% for Black patients and 21.9% for White 
patients (P = 0.53), suggesting that indications and contra-
indications for surgery were equally applied to both racial 
groups in the intervention.
3.1 | Logistic regression
Note that all regression models controlled for gender, age, 
median household income by zip code, race, clinical stage, 
study site, and Charlson score. As expected, age, Charlson 
score, clinical stage, study site, and income were consistently 
associated with treatment differences in all the models that 
included the retrospective and concurrent population groups. 
However, in the intervention only group, the within group 
analyses showed that all these factors became moot except 
for advanced age was associated with less surgery and two 
study sites strongly favored surgery compared to the other 
three sites.
3.2 | Within group comparisons
For the primary outcome, receipt of either of the curative 
treatments, the crude rate for the retrospective baseline 
group favored White patients, 78% vs 69% for Black patients 
(P < 0.001); this difference was confirmed in the adjusted 
model which yielded an odds ratio (OR) of 0.66 for Black 
patients (95% CI 0.51‐0.85, P = 0.001) when compared 
to similar White patients. When the crude rate for surgery 
alone was examined, White patients in this baseline group 
were favored 62% to 59% without statistical significance 
(P = 0.25) in the bivariate comparison. However, in the ad-
justed model, surgery was significantly lower for Black pa-
tients (OR 0.71, 95% CI 0.56‐0.91, P = 0.006). The within 
group comparisons for the intervention cohort did not reveal 
significant disparities. Receipt of either curative treatment 
showed crude rates of 96.5% for Black and 95% for White 
patients (P = 0.56). The adjusted analysis, yielded an OR of 
2.1 (95% CI 0.41‐10.4, P = 0.39) for Black intervention pa-
tients compared to similar White patients confirming treat-
ment parity. The comparison within the intervention for 
the secondary outcome of surgery resulted in a crude rate 
of 75% for Black and 76% for White patients (P = 0.77). 
The adjusted difference for Black patients receiving surgery 
alone (OR 0.77, 95% CI 0.41‐1.44, P = 0.41) or radiation 
alone (OR 1.4, 95% CI 0.75‐2.7, P = 0.28) was not statisti-
cally significant.
3.3 | Between group comparisons
The between group regression results incorporating 
the retrospective and intervention groups are shown in 
Table 3. The race‐group comparisons were all referent to 
the White retrospective group which served as the gold 
standard for treatment rates at baseline. Black patients in

the intervention actually received curative treatment at a 
statistically better rate than the White, baseline group. The 
rate of surgery for Black patients was at least comparable 
to the White baseline rate. Also of note, overall curative 
treatment and surgical care were both received at a sig-
nificantly higher rate in the White intervention group com-
pared to the White baseline suggesting that White patients 
also benefited from the intervention. The other between 
group analysis comparing race‐group combinations in the 
intervention group to White concurrent patients as the ref-
erent group is shown in Table 4. The treatment outcomes 
are consistently statistically superior in the Black and 
White intervention cohorts compared to concurrent con-
trols, making intervention effect much more likely than a 
secular trend.

DISCUSSION
The Institute of Medicine's (IOM) Report on Unequal 
Treatment, released in 2003, highlighted racial and ethnic dis-
parities across a spectrum of health care services.19 Despite the 
enhanced awareness and the spread of individual‐based, cul-
tural competence training after this report, cancer treatment 
disparities persist.20,21 When focus is placed on early stage, 
non‐small cell lung cancer, even when analyses are controlled 
for important confounders such as age, health insurance, socio-
economic status, and comorbid illness, treatment disadvantages 
for Black patients remain.1,4,5,21,22 The surgical treatment gap 
has remained since its first recognition decades ago and differ-
ences in the use of radiation for cure have come to light as the 
role for stereotactic radiation in lung cancer cure evolves.8

The current study used a pragmatic longitudinal trial 
design at five cancer centers and demonstrated that a multi-
faceted intervention reduced the Black‐White treatment gap 
and improved care for patients of both races. What factors 
attenuated disparities using this approach after the impetus of 
the IOM report did not? First, the emphasis on race‐specific 
measurement and feedback must be considered. Cykert et al 
previously demonstrated that comorbidities seemed to garner 
worse interpretations for Black patients compared to similar 
White patients potentially representing implicit bias.5 By pre-
senting data to cancer teams according to race and comorbid-
ity, this intervention component provided the transparency 
needed to highlight unintended trends in care. Second, the 
intervention design took advantage of widespread availability 
of digital data through EHRs. Leveraging technology led to 
a real‐time warning system that flagged patient's missed ap-
pointments so that individuals affected by low health literacy, 
misunderstanding, denial, distrust, or other unanticipated bar-
riers to care could quickly be reengaged. In addition, the same 
system was programmed to recognize the timing of expected 
milestones in care. For patients who did not attain these mile-
stones, despite appointment adherence, warnings informed 
the clinical team about delays related to clinical inertia or 
communication barriers that could potentially be addressed 
in real time. It was this component that likely improved treat-
ment for White patients as in our previous work we demon-
strated that a segment of the White lung cancer population 
with early stage disease eschewed surgery due to mistrust, 
hyper‐religiosity, disbelief of diagnosis, or poor perceptions 
of communication.5 This real‐time registry system mimicked 
Bickell et al who built and evaluated a registry designed to 
address racial and ethnic disparities in adjuvant breast can-
cer care. Bickell's work was successful but required multiple 
phone calls to clinicians’ offices and hand entry of data to 
populate the registry.23 In the current study, data recognition 
and entry were automated and, therefore, will be scalable on a 
whole cancer center population level. Finally, the community 
discussions performed in partnership with the GHDC led to 
community input that validated proposed study interventions 
while enriching navigator training and protocols.
The main limitations of this trial are the patient character-
istic differences found between the intervention and control 
groups. Part of the explanation for these differences is the 
fact that we intentionally oversampled Black patients in the 
intervention. Historically, Black lung cancer patients pres-
ent at a lower median age, have a lower income, and a larger 
male to female ratio than White lung cancer populations.1,5,24 
More than doubling the proportion of Black patients repre-
sented in this sample may explain nearly all the differences 
in these three characteristics. Also, comorbidity scores in the 
retrospective group was obtained by diagnosis counts from 
cancer registries giving more crude estimates of disease 
counts and much less specificity than the scores derived from 
direct clinical data in the other two groups. Nevertheless, in 
response this demographic variability, all regression models 
were specifically adjusted to account for all these differences. 
Also of note, is that we did not adjust for health insurance 
specifically. The reason for this approach is that less than 5% 
of our sample were either uninsured or covered by Medicaid 
creating a cohort almost universally insured. Although pri-
vate insurance coverage in lieu of or in addition to Medicare 
could exert a minimal effect on lung cancer treatment de-
cisions, the effect is trivial compared to the substantial dif-
ference attributed to uninsurance or Medicaid coverage.25 
Finally, when focusing specifically on the within group anal-
ysis of the intervention group, there's no statistically signif-
icant racial difference in overall treatment (which improved 
27% for Black patients and 17% for White patients over long 
documented retrospective rates), surgery (increased 16% and 
14%, respectively), or stereotactic radiation—results much 
different than the within group comparisons in the retrospec-
tive group.
In conclusion, treatment for potentially curable non‐small 
cell lung cancer has been shown for many years to lag behind 
for Black patients. A multifaceted intervention tested in five 
cancer centers using the transparency of race‐specific data 
feedback, real‐time warnings derived from EHRs, and pa-
tient‐centered navigation improved care for both Black and 
White patients while reducing racial differences. Application 
of this system‐based, pragmatic approach to other cancer 
treatment disparities at a health system level could have pos-
itive effects on treatment completion, treatment equity, and 
overall outcomes.
