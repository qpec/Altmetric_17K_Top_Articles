S
troke is the leading cause of adult disability in the devel-
oped world; however, there are no available pharmaco-
therapies outside the acute period to improve the outcome or 
quality of life of stroke survivors. Fatigue affecting the activi-
ties of daily living after a stroke or transient ischemic attack 
is a common problem, with many series reporting over 50% 
of patients complaining of fatigue for months or years post 
stroke. 1 Post-stroke fatigue is a predictor of dependency in 
activities of daily living and is also associated with increased 
morbidity and mortality.2 Persisting fatigue impairs concen-
tration, motivation, and mood and can interfere with engage-
ment in physical and cognitive rehabilitation, limiting the 
effectiveness of rehabilitation strategies.3,4
Post-stroke fatigue may result from one or multiple over-
lapping mechanisms, such as sleep apnea,5 decreased cortical 
excitability,6 pain,7 or decreased cardiorespiratory fitness.8 
Current strategies to assist patients manage post-stroke 
fatigue generally involve conventional physical rehabilita-
tion approaches, which have limited evidence to support their 
effectiveness in clinical practice.9
Modafinil is a wakefulness-promoting agent that stimulates 
monoaminergic pathways to increase the release of histamine, 
norepinephrine, serotonin, dopamine, and orexin.10 Modafinil 
has also been hypothesized to have neuroprotective proper-
ties through enhancement of antioxidative processes to reduce 
free radical formation in neurons11 as well as being a central 
nervous system stimulant that increases the cortical pool of 
neurotransmitters, which may, in turn, promote neural recov-
ery.12 Modafinil has limited known drug interactions and side 
effects, making it a potentially attractive therapeutic option 
Background and Purpose—This study aimed to assess the efficacy of modafinil, a wakefulness-promoting agent in 
alleviating post-stroke fatigue ≥3 months after stroke. We hypothesized that 200 mg of modafinil daily for 6 weeks would 
result in reduced symptoms of fatigue compared with placebo.
Methods—This single-center phase 2 trial used a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, crossover design. The key 
inclusion criterion was a multidimensional fatigue inventory score of ≥60. Patients were randomized to either modafinil or 
placebo for 6 weeks of therapy, then after a 1 week washout period swapped treatment arms for a second 6 weeks of therapy. 
The primary outcome was the multidimensional fatigue inventory; secondary outcomes included the Montreal cognitive 
assessment, the Depression, Anxiety, and Stress Scale (DASS), and the Stroke-Specific Quality of Life (SSQoL) scale. 
The multidimensional fatigue inventory is a self-administered questionnaire with a range of 0 to 100. Treatment efficacy 
was assessed using linear regression by estimating within-person, baseline-adjusted differences in mean outcomes after 
therapy. This trial was registered with the Australian New Zealand Clinical Trials Registry (ACTRN12615000350527).
Results—A total of 232 stroke survivors were screened and 36 were randomized. Participants receiving modafinil reported 
a significant decrease in fatigue (multidimensional fatigue inventory, −7.38; 95% CI, −21.76 to −2.99; P<0.001) and 
improved quality of life (SSQoL, 11.81; 95% CI, 2.31 to 21.31; P=0.0148) compared with placebo. Montreal cognitive 
assessment and DASS were not significantly improved with modafinil therapy during the study period (P>0.05).
Conclusions—Stroke survivors with nonresolving fatigue reported reduced fatigue and improved quality of life after taking 
200 mg daily treatment with modafinil.

for elderly individuals. It has been licensed for the treatment 
of sleep disorders. Modafinil has been tested in clinical trials 
to alleviate fatigue in multiple sclerosis and inpatient stroke 
patients with mixed results in small or incomplete studies.13,14
The aim of this trial was to assess the effects of modafinil in 
strokes survivors, 3 or more months after their event with sig-
nificant fatigue as measured by the multidimensional fatigue 
inventory (MFI). Patients with recognized causes of fatigue 
including a diagnosis of sleep apnea were excluded. We 
hypothesized that in this population, where fatigue was not 
self-resolving, 200 mg of modafinil daily for 6 weeks would 
reduce the symptoms of fatigue compared with placebo.
Methods
This was a phase 2, single-center, randomized trial using a double-
blind, placebo-controlled, crossover design. Patients were random-
ized 1:1 to either modafinil or placebo for the initial 6 weeks of 
treatment, then, after a 1 week, washout period were crossed-over 
into the alternate treatment arm for a second 6 weeks of therapy. 
This study was approved by the Hunter New England Area Health 
District Human Research Ethics Committee and the protocol pub-
lished15 and registered with the Australian New Zealand Clinical 
Trials Registry (ACTRN12615000350527). The trial was performed 
at the John Hunter Hospital, Australia, and participants provided writ-
ten informed consent.
Study Population
Post-stroke patients were recruited from the Newcastle (New South 
Wales, Australia) community and from stroke clinics at John Hunter 
Hospital. Inclusion criteria were patients >18 years of age with a 
history of stroke at least 3 months previously and a score of ≥60 
across all domains of the MFI-20, which has a healthy population 
mean score of 35 to 40.16 All participants were required to provide 
informed consent. Exclusion criteria were known contraindications 
to modafinil: renal impairment, causes of other clinically recognized 
cause of fatigue such as narcolepsy, use of benzodiazepines or anti-
epileptic drugs and pre-existing depression, dementia, or other neu-
ropsychiatric disease. Patients with a recognized diagnosis of sleep 
apnea were excluded. Patients were excluded if the enrolling neurolo-
gist suspected possible sleep apnea due to patient reported snoring, 
difficulty breathing during sleep or sleeping during the day during 
a task.
Randomization and Masking
The study was conducted at the Hunter Medical Research Institute 
(HMRI) Clinical Trials Support Unit. Participants were random-
ized 1:1 to 200 mg modafinil per day or placebo. The placebo was 
manufactured to be physically identical to the modafinil tablets 
and contained rice powder. A computer-generated randomization 
schedule was developed by the HMRI Clinical Research Design, IT, 
and Statistical Support (CReDITSS) unit, and randomization was 
administered by the clinical trials pharmacy independent of study 
researchers.
Treatment
Patients were instructed to take one pill per day with breakfast or in 
the morning. All participants were provided with a 6 weeks supply 
of study drug after randomization. After 6 weeks, participants were 
asked to return to the study center for clinical assessments and to 
return any unused study drug to assess compliance. After the study 
drug had been returned, participants underwent a 1 week washout 
period. On completion of the washout period, participants again 
returned for outcome assessments and were crossed-over to the alter-
nate study medication. After 6 weeks on the second round of study 
drug, participants again returned for outcome assessments and to 
return study drug bottles to assess compliance. Double blinding was 
maintained throughout the duration of the trial with only the clinical 
trials pharmacist aware of treatment allocation. All patient assess-
ments were carried out in the morning.
Outcome Assessment
Assessments were carried out at baseline, in the last week of the 
first 6-week treatment arm, after a 1-week washout period, and in 
the last week of the second 6-week treatment arm (Figure 1). The 
assessments at each time point included the MFI, the Montreal cogni-
tive assessment, the Fatigue Severity Scale (FSS), the Depression, 
Anxiety, and Stress Scale (DASS), and the Stroke-Specific Quality 
of Life (SSQoL) scale. All assessments were carried out by research 
staff blinded to treatment. Drug adherence was monitored through 
tablet return for each patient in each stratum (placebo or active drug).
The MFI is a 20-item self-administered fatigue questionnaire 
designed to measure 5 fatigue domains: general fatigue, physical 
fatigue, reduced activity, reduced motivation, and mental fatigue. 
Each item is scored from 1 to 5 with higher scores indicating greater 
fatigue. The scores within each domain are summed to a total of 20, 
with a whole MFI score of 100. The MFI has been developed17 and 
validated18 to demonstrate limited item redundancy, good reliability, 
strong construct viability, validity in disease, and healthy popula-
tions, with limited floor/ceiling effect.13 The Montreal cognitive 
assessment is a 1 page, 30-point cognitive test designed to assess 
short-term memory recall, visuospatial abilities, executive function, 
attention, concentration, working memory, and language. The FSS is 
a 9-item self-administered questionnaire; each item is scored from 1 
to 7 with higher scores reflecting more fatigue. The FSS has also been 
tested to demonstrate its validity, internal consistency, and discrimi-
natory power to differentiate diseased and healthy populations19,20 and 
is reported as a median. The DASS42 is a 42-item self-reported score 
consisting of statements, which participants must rate each item 0 to 
3 and is designed to assess depression, anxiety, and stress. Finally, 
the SSQoL is a disease-specific quality of life measure consisting of 
49 items assessing 12 domains, which include social roles, mobil-
ity, energy, language, self-care, mood, personality, thinking, upper 
extremity function, family roles, vision, and work/productivity. Each 
item of the SSQoL is ranked on a 5-point scale.
Adverse events were followed closely by the Hunter Medical 
Research Institute clinical trials support unit by a research coordi-
nator not otherwise involved in the study. All adverse events were 
registered by interview through monthly phone calls and review of 
patient files at each visit.
Statistical Analysis
The study was designed to have 80% power to detect a 10-point 
decrease in self-reported fatigue on the MFI after 6 weeks of modafinil 
treatment with a type I error rate of 0.05 and assuming a SD in the 
patient population of 14. A total sample size of 34 was required for 
a crossover study using previously reported effects of modafinil on 
fatigue for Parkinson’s disease,10 multiple sclerosis,21 and a Cochrane 
review.22 Assuming modest participant drop out and study drug com-
pliance, we aimed to recruit 36 participants in total.
For the primary outcome, treatment efficacy was assessed by 
estimating within-person, baseline-adjusted differences in mean 
MFI after modafinil versus placebo. This involved fitting a linear 
regression with fixed effects for participants, treatment (modafinil 
or placebo) and the baseline outcome measure for each treatment. 
The treatment effect was expressed as the mean within-person, base-
line-adjusted treatment effect with its 95% confidence interval and 
P value. Significance was assessed at the 0.05 level for the single 
primary outcome. The same significance level was used for each sec-
ondary outcome.12
For the primary outcome, a potential crossover effect was assessed 
via 2 sensitivity analyses: (1) estimating treatment effects using 
period 1 data only and (2) fitting the primary regression model to the 
data and including terms for treatment sequence and an interaction 
between treatment group and treatment sequence. The interaction

term was assessed for evidence of differential treatment effects by 
treatment sequence, using a significance level of 0.05. For all sec-
ondary outcomes, treatment effects were estimated using the same 
regression model as for the primary outcome and a significance level 
of 0.05. Statistical analyses were programmed using SAS v9.4 (SAS 
Institute, Cary, NC, USA).
The funder of the study had no role in study design, data collection, 
data analysis, data interpretation, or writing of the report. The cor-
responding author had full access to all the data in the study and had 
final responsibility for the decision to submit for publication.
Results
After screening 232 potentially eligible patients during the 
study period with stroke or transient ischemic attack ≥3 
months previously, 38 patients met the eligibility criteria and 
consented to the trial. The great majority of screened patients 
were excluded because of an MFI score of <60 (Figure 1). 
Two of the 38 eligible patients were later excluded from the 
trial; one withdrew consent before receiving medication and 
one received alternative treatment before trial therapy com-
mencement. The study analysis refers to the remaining 36 
randomized patients. Participant baseline characteristics are 
presented in Table 1: the mean age was 63 years (SD, 15) and 
baseline fatigue severity was 72 on the MFI (SD, 8.7). Patients 
mean time post stroke was 9 months (range 3–38 months), 
with 61% being male (22 male and 14 female). Of the enrolled 
patients, 33 were initially diagnosed as ischemic stroke and 
three were hemorrhages. For the patients with ischemic stroke, 
the median baseline National Institutes of Health Stroke Scale 
(NIHSS) for the patients with stroke at admission was 13 (SD 
4) and all 33 had received alteplase.
Participants receiving modafinil reported a significant 
decrease in fatigue compared with those receiving pla-
cebo (differences in means, modafinil–placebo −7.38; 95% 
CI, −21.76 to −2.99; P<0.001; Figure 2). Participants also 
reported a significant reduction in symptom severity for every 
MFI domain (Table 2). At the conclusion of treatment period 
1, participants who had received placebo (n=18) had a mean 
MFI of 58 (SD, 11), whereas participants who had received 
modafinil (n=18) had a mean MFI of 50 (SD, 13). Participants 
who received modafinil for treatment period 1 saw a restora-
tion of the mean MFI score after the washout period (mean 
MFI post-treatment period 1 50, SD 13, mean MFI postwash-
out in patients who received modafinil 59, SD 15). At the con-
clusion of treatment period 2, participants who had received 
modafinil in period 2 (crossing over from placebo after period 
1) had a mean MFI of 48 (SD, 16), whereas those who had 
received placebo (crossing over from modafinil after period 1) 
had a mean MFI of 59 (SD, 15). Treatment effects were, thus, 
similar for the 2 treatment sequences, and there was no sig-
nificant interaction between the treatment effect and treatment 
sequence (P=0.299), suggesting a lack of bias because of a 
crossover effect. The alternate self-reported fatigue assess-
ment, the FSS was also significantly reduced with modafinil 
treatment (differences in means −6.31; 95% CI, −10.69 to 
−1.92; P=0.0048).
Participants also reported a significant improvement in 
quality of life (SSQoL differences in means, modafinil–pla-
cebo 11.81; 95% CI, 2.31–21.31; P=0.0148; Table 3). Within

the domains of the SSQoL, modafinil therapy significantly 
improved self-reported energy (differences in means 1.37; 
95% CI, 0.16–2.58; P=0.0269), mobility (differences in means 
2.07; 95% CI, 0.57–3.57; P=0.0069), social roles (differences 
in means 1.66; 95% CI, 0.07–3.26; P=0.0413), vision (differ-
ences in means 0.8; 95% CI, 0.11–1.49; P=0.0234), and think-
ing (differences in means 0.96; 95% CI, 0.09–1.83; P=0.0314; 
Table 3). The remaining SSQoL domains of family, language, 
mood, personality, work, self-care, and upper extremity did 
not significantly improve with modafinil therapy (P>0.05).
Mood assessment using the DASS did not change signifi-
cantly in those randomized to modafinil (differences in means 
0.87; 95% CI, −0.75 to 2.49; P=0.2916), nor did the DASS 
subdomains change significantly (P>0.05; Table 4). Overall 
cognitive performance assessed using the Montreal cogni-
tive assessment also did not alter significantly with modafinil 
(differences in means 0.32; 95% CI, −0.37 to 1.00; P=0.365). 
However, the Montreal cognitive assessment subdomains of 
abstraction (differences in means 0.12; 95% CI, 0.01–0.22; 
P=0.0266), and visuospatial ability (differences in means 0.2; 
95% CI, 0.04–0.36; P=0.0121; Table 4) showed improvement 
with modafinil.
During the trial period of 13 weeks, there were 12 adverse 
events (modafinil=5, placebo=7), but no serious adverse 
events. The adverse events included headache (4), nausea (1), 
anxiety (2), agitation (3), and dizziness (2).
Discussion
This study, the first of its kind in chronic stroke, has dem-
onstrated that self-reported post-stroke fatigue is signifi-
cantly reduced after 6 weeks of modafinil therapy compared 
with placebo. In addition to the reduction in fatigue, it was 
observed that there was a significant improvement in par-
ticipants’ quality of life. The secondary fatigue measure, the 
FSS, also showed a significant reduction in participants’ self-
reported fatigue, confirming the primary end point. However, 
no significant change was reported for mood or cognition with 
modafinil therapy. These positive findings are encouraging, 
but preliminary, owing to the small size of the study.
The reported significant improvement in patient quality 
of life was due mainly to improvement in the subdomains of 
energy, mobility, social roles, vision, and thinking, which are 
critically important aspects of post-stroke life. Although there 
was no statistically significant improvement in the subdomains 
of family, language, mood, personality, work, upper limb

Treatment with modafinil resulted in a significant decrease in participant self-
reported MFI score (multidimensional fatigue index). Each MFI domain also saw 
a significant decrease in symptom severity. The secondary fatigue measure, the 
FSS (Fatigue Severity Scale) also saw a significant reduction in participant self-
reported fatigue with modafinil therapy.

mobility, or self-care, this may be because of the small study 
sample size or that these aspects of post-stroke life require 
additional interventions. These results also suggest that there 
is some specificity of the effects of modafinil. A recent study 
of modafinil therapy in a more acute population of patients 
with stroke in hospital, which did not recruit to target, was not 
able to show a treatment effect of modafinil on the MFI.14 Of 
note is that the placebo group in this study also had a decline 
in fatigue during their hospital stay, something often observed 
in the initial recovery phase after acute stroke.23 Importantly, 
our study assessed patients more than 3 months post-stroke, 
rather than in the in-hospital setting. By limiting our study 
recruitment to patients with established and persisting fatigue, 
we were able to observe a treatment effect. Finally, the num-
ber of adverse events presented in this trial was much lower 
than a previous trial.20 This may also relate to the differences 
between patient populations, one was an in-hospital patient 
cohort, ours a subacute community-dwelling patient popula-
tion. In this subacute post-stroke population, our data suggest 
that modafinil is not associated with any significant increase 
in adverse events.
A cross-over design can help reduce the influence of 
potential confounding, where patients have unrecognized 
causes of fatigue, in that each participant acts as their own 
control. This study design also allowed for a reduction in the 
required sample size because of a within-patient assessment. 
A potential disadvantage, however, is that if significant patient 
drop out occurs, this can result in a severe statistical penalty. 
Fortunately, this did not occur. Finally, the study dose of 200 
mg daily for 6 weeks is half the maximum safe daily approved 
dose for modafinil in sleep disorders. For this study, 200 mg 
was chosen, in part, because there is not noticeable gain in 
therapeutic benefit over 200 mg, and also because of the older 
patient population studied (compared with previous studies in 
multiple sclerosis where 400 mg was used).
The neurophysiological mechanisms causing post-stroke 
fatigue have yet to be fully elucidated; however, previous 
studies in patients with stroke,24,25 and others having chronic 
fatigue,26 have provided some insight. Electrophysiological 
and functional magnetic resonance imaging studies have dem-
onstrated the presence of a striato-thalamic-frontal “facili-
tation” circuit that acts to increase output from the primary 
motor cortex to compensate for fatigue and maintain perfor-
mance during activity. Chronic fatigue syndrome has been 
shown to be associated with dysfunction of the motor facilita-
tion circuit and sensitization of a counteracting “inhibition” 
circuit centered in the insular cortex and posterior cingulate 
cortex. Both of these processes could also play a role in post-
stroke fatigue. In particular, disruption of the motor facilita-
tion circuit would translate to reduced physical tolerance, 
which is widely described in survivors with stroke,23 as has a 
reduction in motor cortex excitability.27 While this was a small 
cohort and care should be taken in extrapolating such results, 
it is conceivable that restoring some functions to the facilita-
tion circuits through a central nervous system stimulant such 
as modafinil would improve subjective fatigue.
For this trial, several limitations should be noted. This 
study excluded patients with a clinically suspected diagnosis 
of sleep apnea, a well recognized but treatable cause of sleepi-
ness and fatigue. However, specific measures of sleepiness 
were not assessed at baseline or post intervention, thus, we 
cannot exclude that this study may still have included some 
patients with sleep apnea. Finally, despite assessing partici-
pant pill returns to ensure trial medication compliance, we 
cannot guarantee that participants consumed all trial medica-
tion that was not returned.
In conclusion, this study, a randomized, crossover, single-
center, double-blinded, placebo-controlled trial of post-stroke 
fatigue treatment with 6 weeks of 200 mg daily modafinil 
therapy, has demonstrated a significant reduction in fatigue 
and improvement in quality of life during therapy. The results 
of this study suggest that it is appropriate to proceed to a phase 
3 trial of longer-term modafinil therapy with the aim of allevi-

There was some evidence for a reduction in DASS measured stress and the 
MoCA subdomains of abstraction and visuospatial did significantly improve with 
modafinil therapy. DASS indicates Depression, Anxiety, and Stress Scale; and 
MoCA, Montreal cognitive assessment.
