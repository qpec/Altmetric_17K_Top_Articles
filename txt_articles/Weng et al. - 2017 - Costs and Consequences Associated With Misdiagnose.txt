IMPORTANCE Inflammatory dermatoses of the lower extremity are often misdiagnosed as
cellulitis (aka “pseudocellulitis”) and treated with antibiotics and/or hospitalization. There is
limited data on the cost and complications from misdiagnosed cellulitis.
OBJECTIVE To characterize the national health care burden of misdiagnosed cellulitis in
patients admitted for treatment of lower extremity cellulitis.
DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS Cross-sectional study using patients admitted from the
emergency department (ED) of a large urban hospital with a diagnosis of lower extremity
cellulitis between June 2010 and December 2012. Patients who were discharged with a
diagnosis of cellulitis were categorized as having cellulitis, while those who were given an
alternative diagnosis during the hospital course, on discharge, or within 30 days of discharge
were considered to have pseudocellulitis. A literature review was conducted for calculation of
large-scale costs and complication rates. We obtained national cost figures from the Medical
Expenditure Panel Survey (MEPS), provided by the Agency for Healthcare Research and
Quality (AHRQ) for 2010 to calculate the hospitalization costs per year attributed to
misdiagnosed lower extremity pseudocellulitis.
EXPOSURES The exposed group was composed of patients who presented to and were
admitted from the ED with a diagnosis of lower extremity cellulitis.
MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES Patient characteristics, hospital course, and complications
during and after hospitalization were reviewed for each patient, and estimates of annual
costs of misdiagnosed cellulitis in the United States.
RESULTS Of 259 patients, 79 (30.5%) were misdiagnosed with cellulitis, and 52 of these
misdiagnosed patients were admitted primarily for the treatment of cellulitis. Forty-four of
the 52 (84.6%) did not require hospitalization based on ultimate diagnosis, and 48 (92.3%)
received unnecessary antibiotics. We estimate cellulitis misdiagnosis leads to 50 000 to
130 000 unnecessary hospitalizations and $195 million to $515 million in avoidable health
care spending. Unnecessary antibiotics and hospitalization for misdiagnosed cellulitis are
projected to cause more than 9000 nosocomial infections, 1000 to 5000 Clostridium
difficile infections, and 2 to 6 cases of anaphylaxis annually.
CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE Misdiagnosis of lower extremity cellulitis is common and may
lead to unnecessary patient morbidity and considerable health care spending.

ellulitis is a common bacterial skin infection that leads
to 2.3 million emergency department (ED) visits annu-
ally in the United States.1 Between 13.9% and 17%1-3 of
patients seen in the ED with cellulitis are admitted, accounting
for 10% of all infectious disease-related US hospitalizations.4
CellulitisambulatorycarecostsintheUnitedStatesin2006were
$3.7 billion,5 a cost that continues to rise as ambulatory visits
and inpatient admissions increase.6,7
Patients with cellulitis present with erythema, edema,
warmth, and tenderness of the skin. Fever and leukocytosis
may also be present but are not required for diagnosis.8,9 The
clinical course of cellulitis is typically characterized by acute
onset and rapid response to antibiotics. The lower extremity
is involved in 70% to 80% of patients,10 although any area of
skin may be affected. In cases involving the extremities, cel-
lulitis usually presents unilaterally.11 Objective diagnostic mo-
dalities for cellulitis, such as blood and skin cultures (includ-
ing needle aspiration and biopsies) are rarely revealing12,13 and
diagnosis is usually made by medical history and physical
examination alone.
Manyinflammatorydermatosesoftheskinclinicallymimic
cellulitis (aka pseudocellulitis), leading to a misdiagnosis rate
of 30% to 90%.14-16 Common mimickers of cellulitis include
venous stasis dermatitis, lymphedema, deep venous throm-
bosis, gout, and contact dermatitis.17 Patients with presumed

There is limited data on the economic cost, complica-
tions, and unnecessary utilization rates associated with mis-
diagnosed cellulitis. We sought to determine the health care
burden of misdiagnosed cellulitis in patients who were admit-
ted from the ED to the hospital for treatment of lower extrem-
ity cellulitis.
Methods
Case Identification and Data Collection
We performed a retrospective cross-sectional study of all pa-
tients presenting to and admitted from the ED of a large ur-
ban hospital with a diagnosis of lower extremity cellulitis be-
tween June 2010 and December 2012. Patients were identified
using the Research Patient Data Repository (RPDR), a clinical
data registry of all patients within the Partners Healthcare Sys-
tem. Information stored in the RPDR includes patient demo-
graphics, medications, laboratory reports, and visit notes. We
queried the RPDR using ICD9 codes for lower extremity cel-
lulitis (681.10, 682.6, 682.7, 682.8, 682.9), location of service
(ED), and age (≥18 years) to identify eligible patients.
Patients 18 years or older who were diagnosed with cellu-
litis by the ED physician or admitting team, presented directly
to the ED, and were subsequently admitted were eligible for in-
clusion in the study. Exclusion criteria included non–lower
extremitycellulitis,intravenousantibioticswithinthe48hours
prior to presentation, surgery within the prior 30 days, ab-
scess, penetrating trauma, burn, known osteomyelitis, dia-
betic ulcer, or indwelling hardware at site. Patients who were
dischargedwithadiagnosisofcellulitiswerecategorizedashav-
ing cellulitis, whereas those who were given an alternative di-
agnosis during the hospital course, on discharge, or within 30
days of discharge were considered to have pseudocellulitis. For
diagnosesthatwerechangedwithin30days,onlythosethatspe-
cifically changed the diagnosis of the initial cellulitis hospital-
ization were considered. Some medical charts used the term
“erysipelas,
”whichwasconsideredasubtypeofcellulitisinthis
study and therefore included as a cellulitis diagnosis.
Each patient medical record was individually reviewed to
documentmedicalhistory,presentation,andhospitalcoursefor
theiradmission.Followingdischarge,thepostdischargecourse
over 30 days was evaluated, and variables collected included
presence and type of complications (eg, rash, anaphylaxis, gas-
trointestinaldistress,diarrhea,Clostridiumdifficileinfection,in-
fusion reaction, peripherally inserted central catheter place-
mentthrombosisand/orinfection,orhematologicabnormality),
representation to the ED or outpatient clinic, and readmission.
Outpatient, ED, and hospital visits for routine follow-up or is-
sues unrelated to the misdiagnosis were not collected.
A formal medical record review protocol was developed,
and eligible patients were selected per the inclusion and ex-
clusion criteria described above (Figure). Data were recorded
using Research Electronic Data Capture (version 6, REDCap).18
Each reviewer was trained by A.R. and Q.Y.W. during a train-
ing period in which medical records were reviewed together.
All conflicting and ambiguous elements were noted and sub-
sequently discussed among all authors until a unanimous de-
cision was reached. A subset of medical records was also re-
viewed by multiple reviewers to establish interreviewer
consistency.
When evaluating the necessity of antibiotic use or admis-
sion for patients whose cellulitis diagnosis was ultimately
changed, determination of proper treatment was reviewed by
2 board-certified dermatologists (D.K. and A.M.). Diagnoses
that were considered appropriate for admission were mor-
bid, requiring treatments or evaluations that needed to be
treated in a hospital setting (eg, congestive heart failure re-
quiringintravenousdiuretics,calciphylaxisrequiringpaincon-
trol, or critical limb ischemia), while those considered appro-
priate for antibiotics were any condition with a bacterial
Key Points
Question What is the national health care burden of
misdiagnosed lower extremity cellulitis in patients admitted to the
hospital from the emergency department?
Findings In this cross-sectional study that included 259 patients,
30% were misdiagnosed with cellulitis, of which 85% did not
require hospitalization and 92% received unnecessary antibiotics.
Combining these findings with previously published data, cost
estimates, and and projections indicate that cellulitis misdiagnosis
leads to 50 000 to 130 000 unnecessary hospitalizations in the
United States and $195 million to $515 million in avoidable health
care spending annually.
Meaning Misdiagnosis of lower extremity cellulitis is common and
may lead to unnecessary patient morbidity and considerable
health care spending.

etiology (eg, osteomyelitis, septic bursitis). Any difference be-
tween dermatologists on treatment was decided by consen-
sus. Partners Healthcare Institutional Review Board approval
was obtained for this study.
Descriptive Statistics
Our analysis focused on lower extremity pseudocellulitis pa-
tients with cellulitis as the primary diagnosis (Figure). Pa-
tient demographics, length of hospitalization, antibiotic us-
age,unnecessaryadmissions,andcomplicationswerereported
as means (standard deviation [SD]) and counts (percent).
Cost Calculations
The cost analysis was based partially on data from previously
published literature. PubMed and Google Scholar were
searched for the previous decade (January 2005 to December
2015), using the following search terms: “cellulitis” or “skin
and soft tissue infection” or “abscess,” “emergency depart-
ment,” and “United States.” References of key articles were
manually searched to find additional articles. Articles were re-
viewed for primary data on the total annual cases of cellulitis
presenting to the ED, abscess rates, anatomical distribution,
and rate of inpatient admission.
A total of 15 articles were selected with preference given
for recent studies with larger cohorts that reported these val-
ues (eTable 1 in the Supplement). These variables, in addition
to variables calculated from our study (rate of cellulitis mis-
diagnosis, proportion of misdiagnosed cellulitis cases in which
cellulitis is the primary diagnosis, and rate of unnecessary ad-
missions) were used to calculate the annual number of mis-
diagnosed lower extremity cellulitis cases resulting in unnec-
essary inpatient admission from the ED in the United States
(eTables 2 and 3 in the Supplement). Cost ranges were cen-
tered around median values identified through our literature
search. Abscess was excluded from our cost calculation and,
owing to the highly variable abscess rate in the literature, we
used a range of values provided.
We obtained national cost figures from the Medical Ex-
penditure Panel Survey (MEPS), provided by the Agency for
Healthcare Research and Quality (AHRQ) for 201019 to calcu-
late the hospitalization costs per year attributed to misdiag-
nosed lower extremity pseudocellulitis. We next determined
the average length of hospitalization for pseudocellulitis pa-
tients in which presumed cellulitis was the primary reason for
admission and admission was unnecessary. To calculate the
hospital cost per patient, the average patient length of stay was
multiplied by the per diem cost of an average inpatient stay
of that length. This value was multiplied by the total annual
cases of misdiagnosed lower extremity cellulitis as calcu-
lated above (eTable1 in the Supplement) to estimate the an-
nual cost of misdiagnosed cellulitis in the United States.
Results
Patient Characteristics
A total of 840 patient encounters were identified, of which 259
met inclusion criteria (Figure). Of these included patients, 79
(30.5%)patientsweregivenanalternativediagnosisduringthe
hospital course or within 30 days of discharge and were con-
sidered to have pseudocellulitis (Figure) (eTable 4 in the
Supplement). The remaining 180 (69.5%) were all discharged
with a diagnosis of cellulitis. Fifty-two (65.8%) of the pa-
tients with pseudocellulitis had cellulitis as the primary diag-
nosis on admission, and this subgroup was used for all subse-
quent analyses to determine the complications and costs
attributable to the misdiagnosis of cellulitis. Within this sub-
group, 50% were female, the mean (SD) age was 60.4 (17.6)
years, 71% were white, 14% were black, 8% were Hispanic, and
8% were other races (Table 1).
Healthcare Utilization Secondary to Misdiagnosis
Among the 52 pseudocellulitis patients admitted primarily for
cellulitis, the mean (SD) length of hospitalization stay was 4.8
(4.0) days, with 25% staying longer than a week (Table 1). All
52 patients received at least 1 antibiotic intravenously while
in the hospital, with 31 (60%) receiving 2 or more. Thirty (58%)
ofthe52patientsweredischargedonantibiotics,with28(54%)
receiving oral antibiotics and 2 (4%) receiving antibiotics
intravenously.
Clinicalreviewrevealedthat44(85%)of52patientswithmis-
diagnosedcellulitiswouldnothaverequiredhospitaladmission

complication analysis; therefore these following percentages
are calculated out of 44 included patients. Fourteen (31.8%)
patients had a complication or potentially avoidable utiliza-
tion of health care related to their misdiagnosis, antibiotics,
or hospital stay (Table 1). Three (6.8%) patients had an outpa-
tient visit for a complication and 6 (13.6%) patients were re-
admitted within 30 days. Patient complications included drug
eruption, diarrhea, and gastrointestinal distress.
Economic Cost of Misdiagnosis
OfthepatientsadmittedforcellulitisthroughtheED,30%were
ultimately found to have pseudocellulitis (Figure). Among pa-
tients misdiagnosed with cellulitis, 52 of 79 (66%) were ad-
mitted primarily for inpatient treatment of cellulitis, and 44
of 52 (85%) of these admitted patients did not require admis-
sion based on their ultimate diagnosis (Figure) (Table 1).
When determining the total number of patients who are
admittedannuallythroughtheEDforuncomplicatedlowerex-
tremity cellulitis, we excluded patients who presented with an
abscess. In our current study we demonstrate an abscess rate
of 108 of 840 (12.9%), and found a range of 15% to 67%2,20-23
per our literature review. Therefore, we use a range from 12.9%
to 67% for our calculations, and cellulitis cases complicated
by abscess were removed from our cost calculations. Based on
a median of 2 590 380 patients presenting to the ED with cel-
lulitis annually,1,6,20,24,25 this results in an estimated 90 000
to 240 000 patients who are admitted annually through the
ED for uncomplicated lower extremity cellulitis (see detailed
calculations in eTable 2 in the Supplement).
AccordingtotheHouseholdComponentoftheMedicalEx-
penditure Panel Survey (MEPS-HC) for hospital inpatient stays
in 2010, the cost for the mean length of hospital stay for un-
necessary admissions (4.3 days) is $12 656.90 (Table 1).19 Based
on these data and a review of the literature, we estimated that
there are between 18 000 and 48 000 patients admitted
through the ED with a primary diagnosis of presumed lower
extremity cellulitis who are misdiagnosed, of which 15 000 to
40 000 are unnecessary (eTable 2 in the Supplement). This
leads to 66 000 to 175 000 excess inpatient days at an annual
cost of $195 million to $515 million (eTable 3 in the Supple-
ment) (Table 2). This estimate does not include the addi-
tional cost of antibiotics after discharge or subsequent health
care visits for complications related to unnecessary cellulitis
treatment.

population of all patients with misdiagnosed cellulitis, we esti-
matethatinappropriateinterventionsresultin617to1628noso-
comial infections, 437 to 5551 cases of C difficile colitis, and 1 to
7 cases of anaphylaxis annually (Table 3).
Discussion
In this study, we evaluate the clinical and economic conse-
quences of lower extremity cellulitis misdiagnosis. Of 259 pa-
tients admitted with presumed cellulitis, 79 (30.5%) were mis-
diagnosed with cellulitis. Of these misdiagnosed patients, 52
patients were admitted primarily for the treatment of celluli-
tis and further analysis showed that 44 (84.6%) did not re-
quire hospital admission, and that 48 (92.3%) received unnec-
essary antibiotics. Misdiagnosis of cellulitis results in $195
million to 515 million annually in avoidable health care spend-
ing, exclusive of the costs of antibiotics and complications re-
sulting from inappropriate treatment.
We estimate from our study that more than 44 000 pseu-
docellulitis patients are exposed to unnecessary antibiotics an-
nually in the United States, with a hospital readmission rate
of 13% and complications such as rash and gastrointestinal dis-
tress. Antibiotic exposure and unnecessary hospitalization
places patients at risk for C difficile infection, anaphylaxis, gas-
trointestinaldistress,dermatologicalcomplications,andnoso-
comial infections. Our study highlights potentially avoidable
complications and opportunities to reduce significant mor-
bidity and mortality from cellulitis misdiagnosis.
Ourfindingssupportandexpandonpriorstudiesthathave
demonstrated high cellulitis misdiagnosis rates.14,16 We add to
existing data on the incidence of misdiagnosis with a charac-
terization of the clinical and economic health care burden of
misdiagnosedcellulitis.Whileourmisdiagnosisratefallswithin
the lower bounds of the range reported in the literature, the
value is most consistent with other large-scale studies focus-
ing specifically on lower extremity cellulitis.14 Additionally,
educating nondermatological specialties on pseudocellulitis
and encouraging early dermatology consultation may contrib-
ute to lower misdiagnosis rates at our institution.
Misdiagnosis of cellulitis has considerable implications for
antibiotic stewardship. Nearly a third of pseudocellulitis pa-
tients in our study experienced a complication as a direct re-
sult of unnecessary treatment for presumed cellulitis. Antibi-
oticuseisassociatedwithincreasedriskofantibioticdrugtoxic
effects, anaphylaxis, prolonged hospitalization, and selec-
tion of resistant microorganisms.31 While none of our pa-
tients were diagnosed with C difficile colitis or anaphylaxis,
these complications carry the potential for considerable mor-
bidity and mortality and should be a component of judicious
evaluation of appropriate antibiotic use.
Limitations
Our findings must be interpreted in the context of the study
design. This investigation was performed at a single institu-
tion, and although the patients span a wide range of age and
racial demographics, additional studies are needed to assess
the generalizability of our findings. Our patients were se-
lected from those admitted from the ED for presumed cellu-
litis, and these results may not apply in other clinical set-
tings. Decisions for admission may be influenced by
nonmedical factors (eg, homelessness), which were not cap-
tured in our analysis.
Furthermore,wepresentrangesofpotentialcostsandused
conservative estimates that may underestimate the true costs
of misdiagnosis; these estimates and ranges should be vali-
datedinaprospectivemulti-institutionalstudyinmultiplecare
settings to reduce variability. Rates of complications such as
C difficile colitis and anaphylaxis were limited in our small co-
hort, and additional studies are needed to evaluate the spec-
trum of potentially avoidable complications resulting from un-
necessary antibiotics.
Consistent with the established standard in cellulitis
research, our study parameters allowed for the diagnosis of
cellulitis to be made by specialties outside of dermatology,
and therefore not all cases of pseudocellulitis may be
captured.32,33 Although dermatologists have been shown to
identify pseudocellulitis at a high rate, most patients with
presumed cellulitis are never evaluated by a dermatologist,
and this captures a range of clinical presentations more com-
monly seen in practice.
Conclusions
Our study serves as a call to arms for improving the care of pa-
tients with suspected lower extremity cellulitis. A combina-
tion of systems improvement and further categorization of the
biology of cellulitis may lead to a combination of clinical find-
ings and biomarkers that will reduce incorrect diagnosis. It has
beenpreviouslyshownthatdermatologyconsultationinthein-
patient setting may be helpful in increasing diagnostic
accuracy,16,34 and we are presently in the process of develop-
ing a predictive model for the assessment of possible cellulitis.
