Background: Phase II data suggested that guselkumab, an anti-interleukin-23 monoclonal antibody, was
efficacious in psoriasis.
Objective: We sought to assess efficacy and safety of guselkumab in moderate to severe psoriasis versus
placebo and adalimumab, including interrupted treatment and switching adalimumab nonresponders to
guselkumab.
Methods: Patients were randomized to guselkumab 100 mg (weeks 0 and 4, then every 8 weeks; n = 496);
placebo/guselkumab (weeks 0, 4, and 12 then guselkumab at weeks 16 and 20; n = 248); or adalimumab
(80 mg week 0, then 40 mg week 1, and every 2 weeks through week 23; n = 248). At week 28, guselkumab
90% or greater improvement in Psoriasis Area and Severity Index (PASI) score from baseline (PASI 90)
responders were rerandomized to guselkumab or placebo with guselkumab after loss of response.

 Placebo/guselkumab responders and adalimumab responders received placebo, then guselkumab after
loss of response. Nonresponders received guselkumab.
Results: At week 16, more patients receiving guselkumab achieved an Investigator Global Assessment
(IGA) score 0/1 (cleared/minimal) (84.1% vs 8.5%) and PASI 90 (70.0% vs 2.4%) versus placebo (coprimary
end points). Guselkumab was superior to adalimumab at week 16 (IGA score 0/1, 75% or greater
improvement in PASI score from baseline, and PASI 90) and week 24 (IGA score 0/1 and 0, PASI 90, 100%
improvement in PASI score from baseline) (P \.001). From weeks 28 to 48, better persistence of response
was observed in guselkumab maintenance versus withdrawal groups (P \ .001). Of adalimumab
nonresponders who switched to guselkumab, 66.1% achieved PASI 90 at week 48. Guselkumab improved
patient-reported outcomes. Adverse events were comparable among groups.
Limitations: One-year follow-up limits retreatment data.
Conclusions: Guselkumab is a highly effective, well-tolerated, maintenance therapy, including in
adalimumab nonresponders. ( J Am Acad Dermatol 2017;76:418-31.)

Psoriasis
is
a
chronic
immune-mediated
inflam-
matory
disease.
Although
therapeutic
options
have
progressively expanded for
moderate to severe psoriasis,
new
unmet
needs
have
emerged.1,2
Standards
for
treatment goals have esca-
lated; patients often desire
complete skin clearance3,4
and improved long-term ef-
ficacy.5,6 In addition, as new
therapeutic options become
available, more information
is needed about interruption
of and transition between
treatments.
Recent
studies
of
bio-
logics for psoriasis treatment demonstrated substan-
tial efficacy by selectively blocking the interleukin
(IL)-23 or IL-17 pathways, both central to psoriasis
pathogenesis.7-14
Current
findings
show
that
selective inhibition of IL-23 alone results in clinical
response
and
molecular
improvements
in
the
skin.7,9,12,13
Guselkumab (CNTO 1959; Janssen Research &
Development, LLC, Spring House, PA) is a fully
human IgG1 lambda monoclonal antibody that binds
IL-23 and blocks binding and signaling through its
receptor. High levels of efficacy were suggested in
phase I13 and phase II7 studies. To confirm the
therapeutic potential of guselkumab, the phase III
VOYAGE 115 and VOYAGE 2 studies assessed the
efficacy and safety of guselkumab versus placebo
and adalimumab. VOYAGE 1
assessed continuous 1-year
treatment, and VOYAGE 2
evaluated the efficacy and
safety of interrupted treat-
ment,
as
treatment
gaps
frequently occur in clinical
practice.16-19
In
addition,
VOYAGE 2 assessed the tran-
sition from adalimumab to
guselkumab, providing clini-
cally
relevant
information
about patients who switch
biologics.
METHODS
Patients
Adults (aged $18 years)
with
moderate
to
severe
plaque-type psoriasis were eligible. Major inclu-
sion/exclusion criteria are summarized in VOYAGE
1
(NCT02207231).15
The
study
protocol
was
approved by investigational review boards at each
site, and written informed consent was provided by
all patients.
Study design
VOYAGE
2
was
a
phase
III,
multicenter,
randomized, double-blind, placebo- and adalimu-
mab comparatorecontrolled study (NCT02207244)
conducted in 115 global sites from November
2014 to May 2016. The study consisted of a
placebo-controlled
period
(weeks
0-16),
an
active comparatorecontrolled period (weeks 0-28),
CAPSULE SUMMARY
d Guselkumab effectively treated
moderate to severe psoriasis in the
phase II X-PLORE study.
d Phase III VOYAGE 2 confirmed VOYAGE 1
results and demonstrated benefits of
maintenance versus withdrawal therapy,
and effective treatment with
guselkumab among adalimumab
nonresponders.
d Data addressing treatment interruption
and switching patients from adalimumab
to this new, more effective agent are
useful for guiding treatment decisions.

 and a randomized withdrawal and retreatment
period (weeks 28-72). Study results through week
48 are presented here. Patients were randomized
2:1:1 using a permuted block method at baseline to
guselkumab 100 mg at weeks 0, 4, 12, and 20;
placebo at weeks 0, 4, and 12, then guselkumab
at weeks 16 and 20; or adalimumab 80 mg at
week 0, 40 mg at week 1, and every 2 weeks
thereafter
through
week
23
(Fig
1).
Central
randomization occurred using an interactive web-
based response system (Perceptive Informatics, East
Windsor, NJ).
At
week
28,
guselkumab-treated
patients
achieving 90% or greater improvement in Psoriasis
Area and Severity Index (PASI) score from baseline
(PASI 90) (responders) were rerandomized in a 1:1
ratio to guselkumab or placebo. Upon loss of 50% or
more of week-28 PASI response, patients were
retreated with guselkumab, another dose 4 weeks
later,
then
every
8
weeks
(q8w)
thereafter.
Guselkumab nonresponders continued guselkumab
treatment. Placebo/guselkumab nonresponders at
week 28 continued guselkumab q8w, whereas
responders received placebo q8w beginning at
week 28. Upon loss of 50% or more of week-28
PASI
response,
patients
were
retreated
with
guselkumab, another dose 4 weeks later, then q8w
thereafter.
Adalimumab
nonresponders
initiated
guselkumab at week 28, another dose 4 weeks later,
then
q8w
thereafter.
Adalimumab
responders
received placebo and upon loss of 50% or more of
week-28
PASI
response,
initiated
guselkumab,
another dose 4 weeks later, then q8w thereafter
(Fig 1). To maintain the blind, both guselkumab
and adalimumab placebos were administered as
necessary.
Efficacy and safety assessments
Efficacy was assessed through week 24 and safety
through week 28. Key efficacy, including general
and regional psoriasis, patient-reported outcomes,
and safety assessments are discussed in detail in
the VOYAGE 1 study.15 In addition, the Medical
Outcomes Study 36-Item Short Form20 was evaluated
in this study.
Study end points
The coprimary end points were the proportions of
patients achieving an Investigator Global Assessment
(IGA) score of cleared/minimal (0/1) (IGA 0/1) at
week 16 and the proportion of patients achieving
a PASI 90 response at week 16, comparing the
guselkumab and placebo groups. Major secondary
end points are listed in Table I. Regional psoriasis
end points evaluating the scalp, fingernails, and
hand/feet were described in detail elsewhere.15
Statistical analysis
All randomized patients were included in the
primary analysis and some
secondary
efficacy
analyses according to their assigned treatment
group.
To
assess
maintenance
dosing
versus
treatment withdrawal for the major secondary end
points, all patients who underwent the second
randomization and had PASI evaluations after week
28 were included.
The coprimary end points and binary major
secondary
end
points
were
analyzed
using
a
2-sided Cochran-Mantel-Haenszel x2 statistical test
(a = 0.05) stratified by investigator site. Continuous
response parameters were compared using an
analysis of variance model with site as a covariate.
For the time to loss of PASI 90 response, the log-rank
test stratified by site was used.
Patients who discontinued treatment due to lack
of efficacy or an adverse event [AE] of worsening of
psoriasis, or started a protocol-prohibited medica-
tion/therapy to improve psoriasis were considered
treatment failures. Patients meeting treatment failure
criteria before week 16 and patients not returning for
week-16 evaluation were considered nonresponders
for the week-16 primary end point. For patients
randomized to placebo, only those crossing over to
guselkumab at or after week 16 were included in
efficacy analyses after week 16.
To control the overall type 1 error rate, the
primary and major secondary analyses were tested
in a fixed sequence, with the first major secondary
end point tested only if the coprimary end points
were met, and the subsequent end point(s) tested

Safety analyses included all patients receiving 1 or
more study agent administration. AEs and serious
AEs (SAEs) were grouped according to the treatment
received. Antibodies to guselkumab were analyzed.
RESULTS
Patient disposition and baseline demographic
characteristics
In total, 1279 patients were screened and 992
were randomized 2:1:1 to receive guselkumab
(n = 496), placebo (n = 248), or adalimumab
(n = 248) (Fig 2). Overall, 9.7% (96 of 992) of patients
discontinued the study agent through week 48
(guselkumab 7.9%; placebo 11.7%; adalimumab
11.3%) (Fig 2). Baseline demographics and disease
characteristics were generally comparable among
groups (Table II).
Efficacy
Guselkumab was superior to both placebo and
adalimumab with respect to the coprimary end
points and all major secondary end points (P\.001).
Placebo-controlled period (weeks 0-16). At
week 16, significantly greater proportions of patients
receiving guselkumab achieved IGA 0/1 compared
with those receiving placebo (84.1% vs 8.5%;
P \ .001) and achieved a PASI 90 response (70.0%
vs 2.4%; P\.001) (Table III) (coprimary end points).

 Significantly higher percent improvement in PASI
score was observed as early as week 2 in guselkumab
versus placebo groups (P \ .001). In addition, at
week 16, significantly higher proportions of patients
receiving guselkumab achieved 75% or greater (PASI
75) and 100% improvement in PASI score from
baseline (PASI 100) responses compared with those
receiving placebo (Table III). Patients treated with
guselkumab achieved greater improvement in all
regional psoriasis outcome assessments compared
with placebo at week 16 including: scalp-specific
IGA, fingernail Physician Global Assessment, Nail
Psoriasis Severity Index, and Physician Global
Assessment of hands and/or feet (Table III). Similar
to VOYAGE 1,15 guselkumab was superior to
placebo at week 16 in all patient-reported outcomes

Consistent with VOYAGE 1,15 greater improvements
in regional psoriasis disease scores were observed at
week 24 in patients receiving guselkumab versus
adalimumab,
with
the
exception
of
fingernail
Physician Global Assessment score 0/1 and percent
improvement in Nail Psoriasis Severity Index score,
which were comparable (Table III). At week 24, the
proportions of patients achieving DLQI score 0/1,

withdrawal group. Among patients withdrawn from
guselkumab at week 28, PASI 90 response rates
began to diverge from the maintenance group at
week 32. Through week 48, 88.6% of patients in the
maintenance group sustained a PASI 90 response
versus 36.8% of those in the withdrawal group. At
week 48, clinical responses (IGA, PASI) were signif-
icantly greater in the maintenance than in the
withdrawal group (Fig 4) (P \.001). Improvements
in DLQI and PSSD symptom or sign scores from
baseline were also significantly greater at week 48 in
the

 respiratory
tract
infection.
Rates
of
infections,
infections requiring treatment, and serious infections
were similar among groups. No malignancies or
nonmelanoma skin cancers (NMSC) were reported
through week 16. One major adverse cardiovascular
event (MACE) (myocardial infarction) occurred
in the adalimumab group (Table IV). A higher
proportion of adalimumab patients had injection
site reactions (ISR) (6.9% vs 2.6%) and injections
resulting in ISRs (1.5% vs 0.9%) versus guselkumab
patients. Most ISRs were mild.
Active-comparator period (weeks 0-28). The
types of AEs were similar to those reported in the
placebo-controlled period (Table IV). The propor-
tions of patients with 1 or more AE, AEs leading to
discontinuation,
and
SAEs
were
comparable
between the guselkumab and adalimumab groups.
Infections and infections requiring treatment were
also comparable between guselkumab and adalimu-
mab groups. Three serious infections each were
reported in the guselkumab (bronchitis, erysipelas,
and soft-tissue infection) and adalimumab (2 cases of
tuberculosis [1 disseminated], and 1 injection-site
abscess) groups. One malignancy (prostate cancer)
and 2 NMSCs (1 squamous cell carcinoma in the
guselkumab group and 1 basal cell carcinoma in the
placebo/guselkumab
group)
were
reported.
Two MACE (1 myocardial infarction each in the
guselkumab and adalimumab groups) were reported
(Table IV).
Randomized
withdrawal
and
retreatment
period (weeks 28-48). From weeks 28 to 48, no
patients discontinued because of AEs; 1 serious
infection (appendicitis) was reported in the mainte-
nance group. No additional malignancy, NMSC, or
MACE were reported. No AEs were reported among
the 16 retreated patients.
Additional safety through week 48. Through
week 48, 1 additional basal cell carcinoma and 1
additional squamous cell carcinoma of the skin
occurred in the placebo/guselkumab group (data
not shown). Between weeks 28 to 48, 1 additional
MACE (myocardial infarction) was reported in a
placebo/guselkumab patient. No events of serious
infections, malignancies, or MACE occurred in the
adalimumab/guselkumab
group.
No
deaths,
opportunistic
infections,
hypersensitivities,
or
anaphylactic reactions occurred through week 48.
Rates of abnormal laboratory results were low and
comparable between treatment groups through
week 48. Antibodies to guselkumab were detected
in 57 of 869 patients (6.6%) through week 48; titers
were generally low (88% #1:160). No apparent
associations were observed between antibody devel-
opment and decreased efficacy or ISR development
(data not shown).
DISCUSSION
VOYAGE 2 confirms the results of VOYAGE 1,15
demonstrating that guselkumab is highly effective in
treating a broad moderate to severe psoriasis popu-
lation. Guselkumab was superior to placebo at the
week-16 coprimary end points (IGA 0/1 and PASI
90). Guselkumab was also superior to adalimumab at
the week-16 end points (IGA 0/1, PASI 75/PASI 90),
and at week 24 (IGA 0, PASI 90 and PASI 100).
Guselkumab successfully treated difficult regional
psoriasis, including scalp, nails, and hands/feet.
Investigator-assessed improvements were mirrored
by improvements in the patient-reported outcomes
evaluated in VOYAGE 115 (DLQI and PSSD). In
addition, significant improvements in health-related
quality of life (Medical Outcomes Study 36-Item
Short Form) were reported in VOYAGE 2. The
combined robust and comprehensive results from
VOYAGE 115 and VOYAGE 2 demonstrated superi-
ority to both placebo and adalimumab.

 Consistent
with
findings
of
other
psoriasis
biologics,24-27 VOYAGE 2 demonstrated that mainte-
nance was superior to interrupted therapy, and
blockade of IL-23 did not reverse the underlying
mechanism of psoriasis. Unlike VOYAGE 1,15 in
which patients continued treatment for 48 weeks,
in VOYAGE 2, PASI 90 responders were randomized
at week 28 to continue guselkumab or receive
placebo. Guselkumab-treated patients maintained
response, including PASI 90, PASI 100, and IGA 0,
whereas psoriasis slowly recurred and health-related
quality of life was reduced in patients receiving
placebo. The median time to loss of PASI 90
response for withdrawal patients (15.2 weeks) is
relevant because discontinuation rates are significant
with psoriasis biologics use through 1 year (often
50%).17-19
Guselkumab was effective in treating adalimumab
nonresponders (not achieving PASI 90). Patients

 week 28, 5 weeks after the last adalimumab injection.
After 20 weeks of guselkumab treatment, two thirds
of
the
112
adalimumab
nonresponders
who
switched to guselkumab achieved PASI 90 (relative
to baseline). Determining the rate at which patients
who
have
had
suboptimal
responses
achieve
treatment goals could have a significant impact on
treatment
decisions
for
those
seeking
greater
clearance, as more effective psoriasis therapies
emerge.17-19 Although the mechanism of action for
the broader efficacy of guselkumab is unknown, in
psoriasis, tumor necrosis factor-a (released from
CD1631 macrophages/CD11c1 dendritic cells)28
and IL-17A (released from neutrophils, mast cells,
and T-helper 17 cells)29 are effector cytokines
primarily acting on keratinocytes. IL-23 could be
viewed as the overarching master cytokine for
psoriasis because it drives the activation of T cells30
and induces IL-17 production. Moreover, IL-23
induces T-helper 17 and other innate cells to
produce
IL-22, another
cytokine implicated in
psoriasis pathogenesis.31 Therefore, targeting the
IL-23 pathway with an antibody such as guselkumab
can provide higher efficacy and durable responses.

 The safety profile of guselkumab in this study was
consistent with VOYAGE 1.15 The rates and types of
AEs, SAEs, and abnormal laboratory results were
generally comparable with placebo though week 16
and adalimumab through week 28. Through week
48, rates of serious infections, malignancies, and
MACE were low across groups. Overall, there were 2
cases
of
tuberculosis,
both
in
patients
taking
adalimumab. There were 5 malignancies in the
guselkumab-treated patients, 4 of which were
NMSCs (2 basal cell carcinoma and 2 squamous cell
carcinoma).
ISRs
occurred
more
frequently
in
patients receiving adalimumab. Although the safety
profile of guselkumab is favorable, the size and
duration of the study was inadequate to detect rare
events.
There are several other limitations of VOYAGE 2.
Although comparison of guselkumab with adalimu-
mab in VOYAGE 2 was limited to 24 weeks, VOYAGE
115 extended the comparison with adalimumab
through 48 weeks. More importantly, at week 48,

 therapy lost adequate response to assess the efficacy
and safety of retreatment. However, these numbers
will be evaluated at a later study time point.
In conclusion, VOYAGE 2 confirms the results of
VOYAGE 115 that guselkumab demonstrated supe-
rior efficacy to adalimumab and comparable safety
when administered in a convenient dosage regimen
of a single 100-mg injection at weeks 0 and 4, and
q8w. These results suggest that guselkumab may be
an important addition to psoriasis treatment alterna-
tives. In addition, VOYAGE 2 provides important
data on the need for continuing therapy with
guselkumab
to
maintain
the
highest
level
of
response, and successful transition from adalimu-
mab to guselkumab.
