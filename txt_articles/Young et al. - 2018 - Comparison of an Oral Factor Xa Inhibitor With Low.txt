Purpose
Venous thromboembolism (VTE) is common in patients with cancer. Long-term daily subcutaneous
low molecular weight heparin has been standard treatment for such patients. The purpose of this
study was to assess if an oral factor Xa inhibitor, rivaroxaban, would offer an alternative treatment for
VTE in patients with cancer.
Patient and Methods
In this multicenter, randomized, open-label, pilot trial in the United Kingdom, patients with active
cancer who had symptomatic pulmonary embolism (PE), incidental PE, or symptomatic lower-
extremity proximal deep vein thrombosis (DVT) were recruited. Allocation was to dalteparin (200 IU/kg
daily during month 1, then 150 IU/kg daily for months 2-6) or rivaroxaban (15 mg twice daily for 3 weeks,
then 20 mg once daily for a total of 6 months). The primary outcome was VTE recurrence over 6 months.
Safety was assessed by major bleeding and clinically relevant nonmajor bleeding (CRNMB). A sample
size of 400 patients would provide estimates of VTE recurrence to within 6 4.5%, assuming a VTE
recurrence rate at 6 months of 10%.
Results
A total of 203 patients were randomly assigned to each group, 58% of whom had metastases.
Twenty-six patients experienced recurrent VTE (dalteparin, n = 18; rivaroxaban, n = 8). The 6-month
cumulative VTE recurrence rate was 11% (95% CI, 7% to 16%) with dalteparin and 4% (95% CI, 2%
to 9%) with rivaroxaban (hazard ratio [HR], 0.43; 95% CI, 0.19 to 0.99). The 6-month cumulative rate
of major bleeding was 4% (95% CI, 2% to 8%) for dalteparin and 6% (95% CI, 3% to 11%) for
rivaroxaban (HR, 1.83; 95% CI, 0.68 to 4.96). Corresponding rates of CRNMB were 4% (95% CI, 2%
to 9%) and 13% (95% CI, 9% to 19%), respectively (HR, 3.76; 95% CI, 1.63 to 8.69).
Conclusion
Rivaroxaban was associated with relatively low VTE recurrence but higher CRNMB compared with
dalteparin.

INTRODUCTION
Venous thromboembolism (VTE) is a common
occurrence in patients with malignant disease.
Acute VTE is treated with anticoagulant therapy
to prevent recurrent thrombosis, including po-
tentially fatal pulmonary embolism (PE). The risk
of recurrent thrombosis is increased at least two-
fold in patients with cancer compared with pa-
tients without cancer.1 Furthermore, there is an
increased risk of anticoagulant-induced bleeding
in patients with cancer compared with patients
without.2 For more than a decade, low molecular
weight heparin (LMWH) for at least 6 months has
been the standard treatment for acute VTE in
patients with cancer.3,4 In cancer-associated throm-
bosis, there is limited evidence on the duration of
anticoagulant therapy beyond 6 months. Guidelines
recommend that treatment continue as long as the
cancer is active.5
Over the last decade, a new class of antico-
agulant, which directly inhibits a clotting factor
and is not a vitamin K antagonist (VKA), has

 emerged for the prevention and treatment of acute VTE. The direct
oral anticoagulants (DOACs) are dabigatran, inhibiting activated
factor II (thrombin), and rivaroxaban, apixaban, and edoxaban,
inhibiting activated factor X. These agents are noninferior to VKAs
in patients with acute VTE.6-10
LMWH requires daily subcutaneous injection; DOACs are
taken orally and do not require laboratory monitoring. In patients with
anorexia and vomiting, oral administration can be problematic.11
In the EINSTEIN trials (ClinicalTrials.gov identifiers:
NCT00440193 and NCT00439725) , which compared rivaroxaban
with LMWH followed by a VKA in patients with acute symp-
tomatic deep vein thrombosis (DVT) or acute PE,9,10 only 5.5% of
patients had active cancer at baseline.12 The comparator to the
DOAC was a VKA, whereas the standard treatment in cancer is
long-term LMWH.3 Because the generalizability to patients with
active cancer was unclear, we conducted a trial to assess VTE
recurrence rates in patients with active cancer, treated with either
rivaroxaban or dalteparin. The trial provided an opportunity to
address the question of the duration of anticoagulant therapy
beyond 6 months, based on the premise that the presence of re-
sidual DVT on compression ultrasound (CUS) after 5 months of
anticoagulant therapy is a marker for increased risk of recurrent
VTE.13 The comparison of dalteparin and rivaroxaban over
6 months is reported.
PATIENTS AND METHODS
Design
Anticoagulation Therapy in Selected Cancer Patients at Risk of
Recurrence of Venous Thromboembolism (SELECT-D) was a randomized,
open-label, multicenter pilot trial.
Patient Population
The inclusion criteria were patients with active cancer (solid and
hematologic malignancies) presenting with a primary objectively con-
firmed VTE, either symptomatic lower-extremity proximal DVT, symp-
tomatic PE, or incidental PE. Active cancer was defined as a diagnosis of
cancer (other than basal-cell or squamous-cell skin carcinoma) in the
previous 6 months, any treatment for cancer within the previous 6 months,
recurrent or metastatic cancer, or cancer not in complete remission
(hematologic malignancy). In addition, patients had to be age $ 18 years of
age; weigh $ 40 kg; have an Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group per-
formance status of # 2; and have adequate hematologic, hepatic, and renal
function.
The exclusion criteria included taking any previous treatment dose of
anticoagulant or . 75 mg aspirin per day (planned start time of study
therapy was . 96 hours after starting anticoagulant for this VTE), having
a history of VTE, clinically significant liver disease, bacterial endocarditis,
active bleeding or high risk of bleeding, or uncontrolled hypertension, and
inadequate contraceptive measures if of childbearing potential. Con-
comitant use of strong cytochrome P- 450 3A4 inhibitors or inducers or
P-glycoprotein inhibitors or inducers was not permitted. After approval by
ethics committees in the United Kingdom and by the Medicines and
Healthcare Products Regulatory Agency, each center approved the study
protocol. All patients provided written informed consent.
Random Assignment and Study Interventions
Patients were randomly assigned centrally by telephoning Warwick
Clinical Trials Unit. Consenting patients were randomly assigned at
a one-to-one ratio using a computer-based minimization algorithm with
stratification by stage of disease (early or locally advanced disease v
metastatic disease for solid tumors v hematologic malignancy), baseline
platelet count (# 350,000 v . 350,000/mL), type of VTE (symptomatic
VTE v incidental PE), and risk of clotting by tumor type (high v low risk).
Trial staff, participants, and investigators were not blinded to treatment
allocation.
For patients assigned to dalteparin, 200 IU/kg was administered
subcutaneously once daily for the first 30 days of treatment, and then
150 IU/kg was administered subcutaneously once daily for an additional
5 months. The LMWH was supplied by the National Health Service. The
total daily dose was not to exceed 18,000 IU. The dose was also adjusted or
discontinued for low platelet count and significant renal failure until
recovery.
For patients assigned to rivaroxaban, 15-mg tablets were administered
orally with food twice daily for the first 3 weeks, followed by 20-mg tablets
once daily for a total of 6 months. If platelet counts were , 50,000/mm3,
rivaroxaban was to be discontinued until the platelet count recovered
to . 50,000/mm3. A dose reduction or discontinuation was specified for
different levels of renal impairment.
After approximately 5 months of receiving study medication, patients
with an index DVTunderwent CUS of the lower limbs. If the CUS showed
residual DVTor patients had presented with a PE, they were eligible to be
randomly assigned to 6 months of rivaroxaban or placebo. Patients had to
still be receiving trial treatment, be without a VTE recurrence, and satisfy
the baseline inclusion criteria to be approached for the second random
assignment.
Follow-Up
All patients were assessed at 3-month intervals until month 12 and
then at 6-month intervals until month 24. Physical examination (as
clinically indicated) and routine hematology and biochemistry were
performed at each visit. Computed tomography scans and venous ul-
trasonography of upper and lower limbs were performed if clinically
indicated.
Outcomes
The primary outcome of the trial was VTE recurrence. Recurrent
proximal DVT (definition listed in Appendix Table A1, online only) was
confirmed using CUS. Recurrent PE, either symptomatic or incidental PE,
and fatal PE were defined as listed in Appendix Table A1. In addition, other
sites of venous thrombosis (eg, subclavian vein, hepatic vein, and inferior
vena cava) were counted as primary outcome events. Although the study
protocol did not specify central adjudication of suspected VTE events,
reported VTE events were subsequently adjudicated by a central committee
unaware of treatment allocation after the study was completed.
Secondary outcomes were major bleeding and clinically relevant
nonmajor bleeding (CRNMB9; Appendix Table A2, online only).14
Bleeding events were adjudicated by an independent committee of ex-
perienced clinicians unaware of treatment allocation. Adverse events ex-
perienced from trial entry until 30 days after the end of trial treatment were
recorded according to the National Cancer Institute Common Termi-
nology Criteria for Adverse Events (version 4.0).15
Statistics
We conducted a pilot trial to obtain estimates of recurrent VTE rates
to gauge the feasibility of recruiting to a phase III trial and assess the
assumptions for the second random assignment. A target sample size of
530 patients would provide estimates of VTE recurrence rates at 6 months
to within an 8% width of the 95% CI, assuming a VTE recurrence rate at
6 months of 10%.3 In addition, it would ensure that the sample size would
be large enough to allow sufficient numbers for the second random
assignment—a total of 300 patients randomly assigned (150 to each arm)
to provide estimates for a future definitive duration study.

 On September 1, 2016, based on a recommendation from the data and
safety monitoring committee (DSMC), the second random assignment was
closed, with only 92 patients recruited, because it was considered futile to
continue. At the same time, the sample size for the trial was reduced to a total
of 400 patients (200 patients in each arm), because recruitment was slower
than anticipated. This would still allow estimates of the primary outcome to
be within a 95% CI of 9%, instead of 8% as originally planned.
A safety analysis was planned for the first 220 patients (110 in each
arm). This would be sufficient to detect an excess of 10% in major bleeding
and CRNMB rates (80% power; 5% one- sided significance level, assuming
a 5% rate in the control arm).
Because of censoring, VTE recurrence was analyzed using the time to
a VTE recurrence, which was calculated from the date of random as-
signment to the date of first VTE recurrence event or censored at the
analysis date of 6 months or date last known to be VTE recurrence free, if
earlier. Cumulative incidence curves for the time to VTE recurrence were
estimated using the complement of the Kaplan-Meier estimates, and the
VTE recurrence rate at 6 months and 95% CIs were obtained. Kaplan-
Meier estimates were also obtained for bleeding and survival. A Cox model
was used to obtain hazard ratios (HRs) and associated 95% CIs and to
evaluate independent prognostic factors for VTE recurrence. A competing
risk analysis was performed using the cumulative incidence competing risk
method to account for death as a competing risk.16

 approached for participation; 264 patients declined random assign-
ment (Fig 1). Atotal of 406 patients were recruited from 58 sites across
the United Kingdom; 203 patients were allocated to each trial arm.
The baseline characteristics were reasonably comparable between
treatment arms (Table 1). The qualifying event was a symptomatic
DVTor PE in 193 patients (48%) and an incidental PE in 213 patients
(52%). Fifty-eight percent of patients presented with metastatic
disease (Table 1). Colorectal cancer was the primary in approximately
25% of patients (Table 1), and 282 patients (69%) were receiving
anticancer treatment at the time of their VTE, a majority of whom
(83%) were receiving chemotherapy (n = 233; Table 1).
Of the 406 patients randomly assigned, 11 were subsequently
found to be ineligible as a result of lower-extremity distal DVT (n = 5),
jugular vein DVT (n = 2), unconfirmed PE (n = 1), previous DVT
(n = 1), incidental DVT (n = 1), or started trial treatment late because
of pharmacy issues (n = 1). These 11 patients who were allocated
dalteparin (n = 7) or rivaroxaban (n = 4) were included in the analysis
on the basis of an intention to treat. A total of 216 patients (54%)
completed 6 months of trial treatment. The main reason for not
completing the study treatment in both arms was death (Fig 1).
The median duration of treatment was 5.8 months (interquartile
range, 3.0-6.0 months) for dalteparin and 5.9 months (interquartile
range, 2.5-6.0 months) for rivaroxaban. A total of 99 patients
(24%) reported missing doses, 44 (22%) of whom were receiving
dalteparin and 55 (27%) of whom were receiving rivaroxaban.
The main reasons were requiring surgery or a procedure or patient
decision.
Safety Analysis
The DSMC reviewed the results of the safety analysis of the
first 220 patients. The data did not cross the safety boundary of
10% excess in major bleeding or CRNMB. The DSMC also noted
a nonsignificant difference in major bleeding between arms in the
19 patients with cancer of the esophagus or gastroesophageal
junction. These cancers were subsequently excluded from en-
rollment as a precautionary measure.
Recurrent VTE
Twenty-six patients treated with dalteparin (n = 18) or
rivaroxaban (n = 8) experienced a recurrent VTE within the first
6 months after random assignment, including two patients with
symptomatic PE and six with incidental PE receiving dalteparin,

 compared with two symptomatic and one incidental PE in those
receiving rivaroxaban. There was one fatal PE in each arm
(Table 2). The cumulative VTE recurrence rate at 6 months was
11% (95% CI, 7% to 16%) for patients receiving dalteparin and 4%
(95% CI, 2% to 9%) for patients receiving rivaroxaban (HR, 0.43;
95% CI, 0.19 to 0.99; Fig 2). A competing risk analysis showed
similar results (Appendix Fig A1, online only). Site of primary
tumor (stomach or pancreas v other; HR, 5.55; 95% CI, 1.97 to
15.66; lung, lymphoma, gynecologic, or bladder v other; HR, 2.69;
95% CI, 1.11-6.53) and VTE type (symptomatic VTE v incidental
PE; HR, 2.78; 95% CI, 1.20 to 6.41) predicted for VTE recurrence.
Bleeding
Six patients receiving dalteparin had major bleeds, compared
with 11 patients in the rivaroxaban arm (Table 3). The cumulative
major bleed rate at 6 months was 4% (95% CI, 2% to 8%) for
dalteparin and 6% (95% CI, 3% to 11%) for rivaroxaban (HR,
1.83; 95% CI, 0.68 to 4.96; Fig 3). Most major bleeding events were
GI, and there were no CNS bleeds (Table 3). Patients with
esophageal or gastroesophageal cancer tended to experience more
major bleeds with rivaroxaban than with dalteparin—four (36%)
of 11 versus one (11%) of 19 (Appendix Table A3, online only).
An additional seven patients receiving dalteparin had CRNMB
compared with 25 patients in the rivaroxaban arm (Table 3). The cu-
mulative rate of CRNMB at 6 months was 4% (95% CI, 2% to 9%) for
dalteparin and 13% (95% CI, 9% to 19%) for rivaroxaban (HR, 3.76;
95% CI, 1.63 to 8.69). Most CRNMBs were GI or urologic (Table 3).
Survival
A total of 104 patients died within 6 months (dalteparin, n =
56; rivaroxaban, n = 48). Overall survival at 6 months was 70%
(95% CI, 63% to 76%) with dalteparin and 75% (95% CI, 69% to
81%) with rivaroxaban (Appendix Fig A2, online only).
DISCUSSION
The primary goal of our trial was to obtain estimates of the VTE
recurrence rates in patients with cancer treated with rivaroxaban or
dalteparin. The 6-month cumulative risk of recurrent VTE in the
patients receiving dalteparin was consistent with what had been
postulated based on the trial, Low-Molecular–Weight Heparin Versus
a Coumarin for the Prevention of Recurrent Venous Thromboem-
bolism in Patients with Cancer (CLOT) .3 Given that rivaroxaban was
noninferior to initial LMWH followed by a VKA in the EINSTEIN
trials,9,10 and that in CLOT, dalteparin reduced recurrent VTE by 50%
compared with LMWH followed by a VKA,3 we estimated that the
6-month cumulative risk of recurrent VTE in patients receiving
rivaroxaban would be 10% at best. In fact, the observed 6-month
recurrent VTE risk with rivaroxaban was only 4%. It is unlikely that
this reduction in recurrent VTE risk in favor of rivaroxaban was by
chance, because the 95% CI of the HR did not include 1.0.
Most of the cases of recurrent PE in the dalteparin arm were
incidental, related to computed tomography imaging for tumor
status. This did not seem to be the case for the rivaroxaban arm. It
is conceivable that the increased detection of incidental PE was
a chance occurrence.
An important secondary objective of our trial was to assess
rates of major bleeding and CRNMB. The rates of major bleeding
in both trial arms were relatively low and consistent with previously
observed rates.3,4 Most major bleeding events were GI. Upper GI
bleeding is a challenge in patients with atrial fibrillation receiving
rivaroxaban.17 There was a signal that cancer of the esophagus and
gastroesophagus was associated with rivaroxaban-associated major
bleeding. CNS bleeding is a concern in patients with cancer re-
ceiving anticoagulant therapy, and there were no such bleeds in the
trial.
There was a three-fold relative increase in CRNMB with
rivaroxaban compared with dalteparin. Such bleeds were not
trivial, because they had to satisfy at least one of the following
criteria: requiring medical intervention, unscheduled contact with
a physician, interruption or discontinuation of study drug, or
discomfort or impairment of activities of daily life.

Rivaroxaban Versus LMWH for VTE in Patients With Cancer

 In our trial, there were fewer episodes of recurrent VTE as-
sociated with rivaroxaban, but there was an increase in bleeding.
LMWH accelerates the inhibition by antithrombin of activated
factor X in the conversion of prothrombin to thrombin.18
Rivaroxaban binds directly and reversibly to factor Xa and com-
petitively inhibits factor Xa. It is 10,000-fold more selective for
factor Xa than other related serine proteases, and it does not re-
quire cofactors (eg, antithrombin) to exert its anticoagulant effect.
Rivaroxaban also inhibits both free and clot-bound factor Xa, as
well as prothrombinase activity.19 It is plausible that the enhanced
antithrombotic effect of rivaroxaban is associated with a greater
perturbation of coagulation, predisposing to more bleeding. Fi-
nally, it is recognized that in terms of GI bleeding, rivaroxaban has
both a local and systemic effect.20
Our trial is not without limitations. Recruitment was slower
than anticipated. Our postulates for the number of patients who
would be available to participate in the second random assignment
were overly optimistic, there was a high mortality rate, and cli-
nicians were choosing not to randomly assign to rivaroxaban
versus placebo for many patients. Reducing the sample size re-
quired for the first random assignment did not substantially lower
the precision of the estimates of the observed outcome rates. The
results of our trial reflect only 6 months of treatment and are not
generalizable to longer treatment.
Some might consider the SELECT-D trial rather large for a ran-
domized pilot study.21 However, we consider the study design in-
novative because it addressed two questions. Although we were unable
to answer the question of treatment duration beyond 6 months, we
were successful in meeting our primaryaim, whichwas to obtain robust
estimates of VTE and bleeding rates for the treatment arms.
In VTE trials, DVT and PE are usually the primary outcome
events. We also counted other sites of DVT as primary events. It is
not unreasonable to expect anticoagulant therapy to have an effect
on such sites. In an exploratory analysis, when only DVT and PE
were considered, the rates of recurrent VTE at 6 months were
consistent with those in other trials.3,4,22
In the recently published Hokusai trial (ClinicalTrials.gov
identifier: NCT02073682), patients with cancer with VTE were
randomly assigned to either LMWH for at least 5 days followed by
the DOAC edoxaban or dalteparin for at least 6 months.22 The
primary outcome was a composite of either recurrent VTE or major
bleeding. Edoxaban was found to be noninferior to dalteparin. Over
the first 6-month period, the recurrent VTE rate was 6.5% with
edoxaban and 8.8% with dalteparin, but rates were 5.6% and 3.2%
for major bleeding and 12.3% and 8.2% for CRNMB, respectively.
Although there are limitations to between-study comparisons, the
results of our trial are consistent with those of this study.
The results of our trial provide evidence that rivaroxaban is an
effective alternative to LMWH for the treatment of VTE in cancer.
Rivaroxaban reduced the rate of recurrent VTE compared with

 LMWH, but at the cost of more bleeding. Oral administration is
more convenient than daily subcutaneous injections. It should be
used with particular caution in patients with esophageal cancer. At
the end of the day, a patient’s preference for a specific anticoagulant
is based on a careful discussion between patient and physician
about the benefits and risks of the treatment alternatives.
