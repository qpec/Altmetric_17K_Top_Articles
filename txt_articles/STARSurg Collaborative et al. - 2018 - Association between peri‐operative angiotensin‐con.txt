Association between peri-operative angiotensin-converting
enzyme inhibitors and angiotensin-2 receptor blockers
and acute kidney injury in major elective non-cardiac
surgery: a multicentre, prospective cohort study
STARSurg Collaborative*
Summary
The peri-operative use of angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors or angiotensin-2 receptor blockers is
thought to be associated with an increased risk of postoperative acute kidney injury. To reduce this risk,
these agents are commonly withheld during the peri-operative period. This study aimed to investigate if
withholding angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors or angiotensin-2 receptor blockers peri-operatively
reduces the risk of acute kidney injury following major non-cardiac surgery. Patients undergoing elective
major surgery on the gastrointestinal tract and/or the liver were eligible for inclusion in this prospective
study. The primary outcome was the development of acute kidney injury within seven days of operation.
Adjusted multi-level models were used to account for centre-level effects and propensity score matching
was used to reduce the effects of selection bias between treatment groups. A total of 949 patients were
included from 160 centres across the UK and Republic of Ireland. From this population, 573 (60.4%)
patients had their angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors or angiotensin-2 receptor blockers withheld
during the peri-operative period. One hundred and seventy-five (18.4%) patients developed acute kidney
injury; there was no difference in the incidence of acute kidney injury between patients who had their
angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors or angiotensin-2 receptor blockers continued or withheld
(107
(18.7%)
vs.
68
(18.1%),
respectively;
p = 0.914).
Following
propensity
matching,
withholding
angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors or angiotensin-2 receptor blockers did not demonstrate a protec-
tive effect against the development of postoperative acute kidney injury (OR (95%CI) 0.89 (0.58–1.34);
p = 0.567).

Introduction
Acute kidney injury (AKI) following elective, non-cardiac
surgery is increasingly recognised as an important postoperative
complication. A recent meta-analysis demonstrated that
one in six patients undergoing major abdominal surgery
suffer AKI [1]. Despite most AKI being classified as ‘mild’
(a small increase in serum creatinine level, and returning
to pre-operative baseline), sustaining AKI postoperatively
is associated with a 12-fold increase in the unadjusted
risk of in-hospital mortality and a three-fold increase in

 one-year mortality [1–3]. There is concern that the stress
response to surgery, which typically lowers serum crea-
tinine in its early anabolic phase, may be masking the
true severity of postoperative AKI, and overestimating
renal recovery. In severe AKI, its impact is more apparent,
when
temporary
renal
replacement
therapy
may
be
required.
The development of AKI following elective surgery is a
multifactorial process. Induction of general anaesthesia,
intra-operative fluid depletion (including bleeding), systemic
inflammatory responses and insensible fluid losses all
contribute towards a reduction in end-organ perfusion
and subsequent renal injury [2]. Nephrotoxic drugs and
intravenous contrast dyes are also used commonly in the
peri-operative setting, with risk of interstitial nephritis and
acute tubular damage. Patient comorbidities, particularly
cardiovascular disease, chronic renal disease and renal
artery stenosis, further increase the risk of AKI in this cohort
[3, 4]. Concerns exist regarding the mechanism of action
of commonly used antihypertensive drugs and the risk of
postoperative
AKI
[5].
Angiotensin-converting
enzyme
inhibitors
(ACEi)
and
angiotensin-2
receptor
blockers
(ARBs) may increase the risk of AKI through a range of
mechanisms, including systemic hypotension, renal artery
constriction and interstitial nephritis [6]. Withholding these
agents in the peri-operative period may be an effective
means of reducing the burden of postoperative AKI.
When multiple antihypertensive drugs are used concur-
rently, the risk of AKI may be even more significant [7]. In
patients aged < 55 years, ACEi or ARBs are recommended
as
first-line
treatment
of
hypertension
before
elective
surgery [8] and offer long-term benefits to patients with
significant cardiovascular and renal disease [9]. In patients
with chronic kidney disease (CKD) and diabetes, ACEi/ARBs
are recommended by the National Institute of Health and
Care Excellence, due to their renoprotective effect [10, 11].
In cardiac surgery, the peri-operative administration of ACEi/
ARBs has been associated with a lower-risk of AKI [12, 13].
There is currently a paucity of data to support the routine
continuation or withholding of ACEi/ARBs peri-operatively in
non-cardiac surgery, with no large cohort or randomised
studies examining the impact on the incidence of AKI.
This study aimed to identify whether withholding
ACEi/ARBs pre-operatively reduces the incidence of post-
operative AKI following major, elective gastro-intestinal
and liver surgery.
Methods
In this prospective, observational, multicentre study, data
were
collected
from
patients
undergoing
elective
gastrointestinal or liver surgery between 23 September
and 18 November 2015. Any hospital in the UK and
Republic
of
Ireland
providing
elective
surgery
was
eligible to participate. Data were collected according to
a previously published study protocol [14]. A UK research
ethics committee determined that this project did not
require ethical approval as the variables collected were
routine clinical data and no change or intervention was
made to patient care. However, each participating centre
was responsible for local registration of the study as
service evaluation/clinical audit and gaining Caldicott
guardian approval. Data were collected across a collabo-
rative student audit and research network, which has been
described previously [14]. Briefly, data collection in each
unit was performed by teams consisting of two to three
medical students, with a supervising junior doctor and
consultant providing oversight and guidance. This study is
reported according to STROBE guidelines [15].
Each participating centre collected data on consecu-
tive patients during predefined two-week intervals. Con-
secutive patients aged ≥ 18 years undergoing elective
bowel resection, liver resection, or reversal of ileostomy
or colostomy were eligible for inclusion. All operative
approaches were eligible for inclusion, including open,
laparoscopic and robotic procedures. Bowel resection
was defined as complete transection and removal of a
continuous section of bowel. The following were not
studied:
cholecystectomy
and
hernia
repair
with
no
resection of the liver or bowel; gynaecological, urologi-
cal, vascular or transplant procedures; patients on renal
replacement therapy (RRT) pre-operatively; and patients
who had previously received a renal transplant.
The primary outcome of this study was the incidence
of AKI within seven days of surgery. The Kidney Disease
Improving Global Outcomes (KDIGO) serum creatinine-
based criteria for AKI were used (26.5 lmol.l�1 rise in
serum creatinine within 48 h or > 50% rise in serum
creatinine within seven days) [16]. Serial measurements
were used to calculate increases in serum creatinine.
Since urine output is often measured and documented
poorly, the KDIGO urine output criteria for AKI were not
used within this observational study. Secondary outcome
measures were the requirement for RRT (defined as a
new postoperative requirement of dialysis (haemodialysis,
peritoneal dialysis or haemofiltration) and mortality within
30 days after surgery.

and

ACEi/ARB
medication withheld ≥ 24 h before surgery.
The peri-operative administration of other medica-
tions was defined within the study protocol [14]. For
diuretics, all loop, thiazide, thiazide-like and potassium-
sparing diuretics were considered together and could
have been administered before or after the operation.
Peri-operative
non-steroidal
anti-inflammatory
drug
(NSAID) administration was defined as intra-operative
administration or if the patient was taking them before or
following the operation. Owing to the complex nature of
aminoglycoside pharmacokinetics, peri-operative amino-
glycoside administration was defined as either at least
one intra-operative dose, or dosing in the first seven
postoperative days. The day of surgery was defined as
postoperative day 0. Pre-operative was defined as up to
7 days before surgery and postoperative was considered
within 7 days after surgery.
Additional data collected included: age (in completed
years); sex; ASA physical status; ethnicity; smoking status;
intra-operative aminoglycoside administration; history of
cardiovascular disease; estimated glomerular filtration rate
(eGFR)/chronic kidney disease stage; operative approach;
history of diabetes mellitus; and intra-operative contamina-
tion. Estimated glomerular filtration rate was calculated
using the Chronic Kidney Disease Epidemiology Collabo-
ration
(CKD-EPI)
equation
with
an
upper
bound
of
120 ml.min�1.1.73 m�2 due to the formula’s bounds of
sensitivity [17]. This was then equated to a pre-operative
CKD stage using the KDIGO classification [16].
Local investigators uploaded data to a secure online
website, provided using the Research Electronic Data
Capture (REDCap) system [18]. The submitted data were
checked centrally. Investigators who submitted entries with
incomplete or incorrect data were contacted to ensure
data integrity. Where data were missing over 5% of predic-
tor variables, it was intended to impute this using a Markov
chain Monte Carlo multiple imputation approach. Before
undertaking the study, collaborators were invited to inves-
tigator meetings and required to complete training mod-
ules on outcome assessment and data security. On
completion of the study, data points were validated for
accuracy and case ascertainment by investigators who
were independent from the teams collecting data at each
centre. Data accuracy was calculated by the number of
correct individual data fields per centre divided by the
total number of data points collected at that given centre.
Case
ascertainment
was
calculated
by
dividing
the
number of correctly included cases by the number of cases
eligible for inclusion within the given data collection period.
There is a paucity of high-quality non-randomised
data on the effects of ACEi/ARB on the incidence of AKI,
which thus precluded formal sample size calculation. We
hypothesised 12% of patients would develop AKI post-
operatively and that withholding ACEi/ARBs would be
associated with an absolute risk reduction of 7%. Given
these assumptions, we required 332 patients in each
group, given a power of 0.90 and a two-sided a of 0.05,
with an allocation ratio of 1:1.
Due to the influence of selection bias on patients
receiving
ACEi/ARBs
and
cardiovascular
risk
factors,
careful adjustment for these factors was required. Baseline
characteristics and outcome data were summarised using
basic counts and percentages to create summary tables.
Testing between treatment groups in summary tables was
done using the Chi-squared test, or in the case of continu-
ous variables, independent sample t-tests or Kruskal–
Wallis test. Univariable logistic regression models were
used to identify factors associated with the subsequent
development of AKI. From these univariable models, clini-
cally plausible variables, including cardiovascular risk fac-
tors, were entered into multilevel models, to account for
individual patient-level risk (at level 1) and centre-level ran-
dom effects (at level 2) across treatment groups. A near-
est-neighbour propensity score matching algorithm was
then used to further account for factors implicated with
ACEi/ARB administration in an approximate 1:1 ratio. This
propensity-matched model aimed to account for selection
bias present between treatment groups to provide more
accurate effects estimates, thus reducing selection bias. A
calliper was set at 0.1 SD to select the closest matched
patients. No with or without replacement was performed.
Once the propensity-matched models had been designed
to consider clinically-relevant variables, they were checked
for
balance
using
univariable
statistical
comparison.
Propensity models were then rebalanced to account for
any variables which were not accounted for adequately on
the initial match. We also adjusted for confounding factors
in subsequent logistic regression models used on the
matched data. This is known as a ‘doubly robust’ approach
as it combines two methods to reduce the effects of selec-
tion bias and is less sensitive to mis-specification. All sec-
ond-order interactions were explored using multiplicative
models. Model fit was guided using the Akaike informa-
tion criterion (AIC), with a lower AIC indicative of a better
fit. Effect estimates are presented as OR, alongside their
95%CI. Statistical significance was set at the level p < 0.05.
All statistical analyses were performed using the R 3.2.1
software package (R Foundation for Statistical Computing,
Vienna, Austria).

 Results
Over the study period, 949 patients undergoing elective
surgery on ACEi/ARB therapy were included from 160
centres in the UK and Republic of Ireland (Fig. 1). This
was a planned subset analysis of a prospective cohort
study investigating the incidence of AKI after surgery
[14]. In this study, 949 out of 4423 patients (21.5%) were
prescribed ACEi/ARBs before admission (Fig. 1.). Out of
4423 patients, ACEi/ARB prescription data were missing
for 37 (0.8%). Independent validation of 12,096 data
points from 1008 patients from the study that these data
were obtained from, demonstrated the data accuracy to
be 98.0%, with a case ascertainment rate of 92.2%.
Baseline data were similar for the two study cohorts
(Table 1).
Patients who had their ACEi/ARBs therapy continued
peri-operatively did not have a higher incidence of
postoperative AKI compared with those who had these
drugs withheld (68 (18.1%) vs. 107 (18.7%), respectively;
p = 0.914). Furthermore, for patients who did sustain AKI,
this was comparable in severity across both study cohorts
(Table 2). At the univariable level, withholding ACEi/ARBs
over the peri-operative period was not associated with a
reduction in risk of AKI (Table 3). Following adjustment
for explanatory variables which included: age; sex; ASA
physical
status;
CKD
stage;
smoking;
hypertension;
congestive cardiac failure; diabetes; and peri-operative
aminoglycoside
administration,
there
remained
no
association (Table 3). To reduce the influence of selection
bias, patients in both study cohorts were matched using

After
the
matching algorithm was applied there were no significant
differences between cohorts (see Appendix S1). After
propensity score matching, the lack of observed effect
between
withholding
ACEi/ARB
therapy
and
AKI
remained (Table 4).
There was no significant difference between 30-day
mortality and requirement for renal replacement therapy
between the study cohorts. At the univariable level, there
were no associations between withholding ACEi/ARBs
and postoperative mortality at 30 days (Table 5). When
this was adjusted for the effects of explanatory variable,
there
remained
no
association
between
withholding
ACEi/ARBs and the risk of death within 30 postoperative
days (Table 5).
Discussion
This large, prospective study found that withholding
ACEi/ARB therapy peri-operatively was not associated
with a lower incidence of AKI after major, non-cardiac
surgery. When we accounted for the use of other medica-
tions with known nephrotoxicity, such as diuretics and
aminoglycoside antibiotics, there was still no association
between withholding ACEi/ARBs peri-operatively and the
subsequent development of AKI.
Controversy remains surrounding the peri-operative
use of ACEi/ARBs as they have traditionally been thought
to contribute towards the development of AKI [3, 7,
18–21]. The proposed mechanisms behind this include
lower
systemic
blood
pressure,
contributing
towards
intra-operative hypotension, and renal artery vasoconstric-
tion, both of which result in renal hypoperfusion and
ischaemia [4, 22].
A recent large cohort study [19] has investigated the
use of ACEi/ARBs peri-operatively and found that with-
holding ACEi/ARBs for 24 h before non-cardiac surgery

STARSurg Collaborative | Peri-operative acute kidney injury and ACEi/ARB use
 was associated with a reduction in a composite end-point
of mortality and cardiovascular events. Although the
authors suggested that withholding ACEi/ARBs may be
beneficial, they did not study the relationship between
withholding ACEi/ARBs and postoperative AKI. As data
on this key clinical outcome were not collected, we
believe that our study is the only large prospective
cohort analysis that examines the effects of withholding
ACEi/ARBs in a non-cardiac surgical population on the
incidence of AKI.
Randomised controlled trials of withholding ACEi/
ARBs in the peri-operative setting have largely focussed
on physiological end-points (e.g. intra-operative hypo-
tension) rather than clinical end-points (e.g. subsequent
renal function or death) [19, 24]. Despite these shortcom-
ings, studies have found that patients on long-term ACEi/
ARB therapy were more likely to have episodes of post-
induction
hypotension
and
require
inotropic
support
intra-operatively [22–24]. Conversely, in cardiothoracic
surgery, the use of ACEi/ARBs has been shown to

 decrease the rate of postoperative atrial fibrillation and
has been implicated with a reduction in postoperative
cardiovascular events, although this remains controversial
[12].
Future research is required to further define the role
of postoperative ACEi/ARB in non-cardiac surgery. Large
cohort studies including ours and others [19] have sepa-
rately identified potential benefits and harms to routinely
withholding
ACEi/ARBs
peri-operatively.
Observational
studies are limited due to a high risk of selection bias;
therefore, a large randomised trial would provide greater
clarity. Any such trial should take into consideration
the drug elimination time for ACEi/ARBs which varies
between agents. It should also aim to capture outcomes
on both cardiovascular, renal and postoperative out-
comes (including intra-operative hypotension), in addition
to conducting a follow-up to elucidate the long-term con-
sequences of withholding ACEi/ARB therapy. Outside of
a trial, future research should focus on discovering treat-
ments and biomarkers which could prevent and detect
postoperative AKI.
At present, there are randomised trials underway in
orthopaedics and cardiac surgery which will contribute to
the ongoing debate [25–27].
A key strength of our study is the use of accurate,
validated data from a prospective, multicentre cohort
study.
In
this
context,
it
makes
the
findings
widely
generalisable. Collection of prospective data on patients
undergoing major gastro-intestinal surgery allowed for
creatinine levels to be recorded to detect AKI according
to the KDIGO classification [16], although this should be
considered with the caveat that collection of the urine
output criteria was not feasible. This clear and objective
outcome assessment enabled this study to identify a
higher incidence of AKI than previously reported in other
studies [2, 28, 29]. Furthermore, this study collected data
on other variables thought to contribute towards AKI (in-
cluding medications), which enabled us to explore multi-
ple variables as opposed to ACEi/ARBs use in isolation.
Our study has several limitations to consider. As an
observational study, it is subject to selection bias. We
attempted
to
minimise
this
through
careful
risk-
adjustment and using methods for causal inference to
provide a robust sensitivity analysis. It is important to con-
sider that clinical decisions are not random and, in our
study, patients who had their ACEi/ARB withheld before
surgery may have been considered to be at higher risk of
developing AKI. Furthermore, ACEi/ARBs have a terminal
serum half-life of up to 40 h. Our study and another [19]
both defined withholding as “stopping medications up to
24 h prior to surgery”; thus, patients may still have had
residual systemic levels of ACEi/ARBs. However, this time-
frame may more accurately replicate clinical practice. In
our study, we only included elective procedures, as emer-
gency surgical patients were not likely to have had their
ACEi/ARBs withheld. Another important factor to consider
is the fluid balance status of the patient during the peri-
operative period. Fluid balance is a major contributory

 factor for AKI, and patients undergoing major gastro-
intestinal surgery may potentially experience substantial
physiological disturbance to their volaemic status. Other
factors include the presence of intra- and postoperative
hypotension, which would impact upon renal perfusion.
We did not collect haemodynamic or fluid balance data,
as these are complex and intrinsically linked factors
which have been studied in depth already [22]. Neverthe-
less, these factors may have influenced our study’s find-
ings. Our study relied on routinely collected blood
samples for the measurement of serum creatinine. It is
possible that some patients may have had a rise in crea-
tinine which was undetected by routine sampling; there-
fore, we propose the incidence of AKI in this study is a
conservative estimate. Furthermore, our study may have
underestimated the incidence of AKI due to excluding
the KDIGO urine output criteria for AKI diagnosis.
This study is the largest of its type investigating the
effects
of
withholding
ACEi/ARB
therapy
during
the
peri-operative period in major elective, non-cardiac surgical
patients. Our data do not show that the routine withholding
of ACEi/ARBs in peri-operative setting has any impact on
the incidence of postoperative AKI. Policymakers should
consider pursuing a definitive answer to the research
question through a well-conducted, randomised trial.
