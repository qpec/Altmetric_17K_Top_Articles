Objective
Development in biomedical and computer sciences, wire-
less communication techniques, and low-energy con-
sumption microprocessors with sophisticated algorithms 
led to the recent widespread innovation of wearable mon-
itoring systems.1 Continuous monitoring and transmis-
sion of physiological parameters in infants are not limited 
to alerting for and prevention of life-threatening events. It 
also represents an opportunity for physicians and scien-
tists to identify or predict various pathological conditions 
and provide insights into the behavioral and physical 
development of a child.
However, the utility of home-based continuous moni-
toring, especially in healthy, term newborns, remains a 
controversial topic in the clinical community. Proponents 
suggest that this type of monitoring can provide parents 
and physicians valuable information about infant health, 
potentially alerting when an infant is in crisis and enabling 
timely intervention.2 Critics expressed concerns about 
 
frequent false alarms, high cost of monitors, increase 
 
in parental anxiety, and the risk of overdiagnosis.3,4 
Currently, limited comprehensive, contemporary data 
exist to support or reject the usefulness of home-based 
continuous monitoring in infants.
The objective of this report is to describe the initial 
experience with home use of the Owlet Smart Sock 
(OSS), a novel, miniaturized, wireless, vital signs moni-
toring device in 47,495 newborns between October 2015 
and June 2017 and to share insights into the largest 
reported series. With known limitations of current 
reports (descriptive statistics vs randomized clinical 
study, parent-reported prematurity, events retrospec-
tively verified by physicians), the unique home use pat-
terns, normative physiological reference ranges for 
oxygen saturation (SpO2) and heart rate (HR) for vari-
ous newborn age groups, and a case study on apnea of 
prematurity (AOP) detection while using the OSS are 
presented in this article.

Abstract
We report the largest experience, to our knowledge, of home cardiorespiratory monitoring in 47,495 newborns 
using the novel Owlet Smart Sock (OSS) technology (October 2015 to May 2017). On average, 47,495 newborns 
were monitored for 6 months, 4.5 d/wk, 9.9 h/d. Continuous readings of oxygen saturation and heart rate were 
obtained from 39,626 full-term newborns. OSS users were likely first-time parents in their 30s with at least a 
college degree; 37% had a healthcare professional in the family; and 28% were at or below median income level 
per the US Census Bureau. “Peace of mind” was the reason to own an OSS in 75%, and 82% of parents followed 
Safe Sleep Guidelines. A total of 94% of parents reported a better quality of sleep. The fast and continuous pace of 
device adoption and reported experience suggest excellent parental acceptance of the OSS. Prospective studies are 
warranted to further evaluate its applications in the high-risk newborn population.

Materials and Methods
Study Population
Owlet Baby Care, Inc., to the best of our knowledge, has 
amassed the largest data set on home use of the OSS 
vital signs monitor in newborns up to 12 months of age. 
The study population described includes 47,495 new-
borns (“active users”) between the commercial launch 
of the device in October 2015 and May 2017, when 
additional demographic surveys were conducted.
Active users were defined as those who activated the 
OSS for their newborns between 1 and 12 months of 
age, with total monitoring time ≥24 hours. Individual 
monitoring sessions <2 hours in duration and newborns 
with inconclusive or missing age were excluded from 
the current analysis. The newborns were predominantly 
located in the United States and Canada.
The continuous variables SpO2 and HR were obtained 
from 39,626 full-term newborns. OSS usage statistics 
were collected from all 47,495 active users. Demographic 
data self-reported by parents of newborns were available 
from 5125 users (24.2% response rate) who participated 
in a survey of all active users in May 2017.
It is important to note the following points: (1) only 
experience with the commercially available version of 
the OSS is the subject of the current report; the medical 
grade version of the OSS (class II) is currently under 
review by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) and 
is not commercially available in the United States or 
Canada; (2) no claims or representations were made on 
the use of the current version of the device in clinical 
settings; (3) continuous variables (SpO2, HR) and alerts 
information (rates and types) were obtained via direct 
output during monitoring.
Device Description
The OSS (Lehi, UT) is designed to provide continuous 
monitoring of vital signs (SpO2 and HR) in newborns via 
a sensor-embedded sock during their sleep in home set-
tings. The OSS kit includes a base station, pulse oxime-
ter, charging cords, and socks in 3 sizes (designed to fit 
newborns to children 15 to 18 months of age). The mate-
rials used for the OSS are durable, hypoallergenic, and 
safety tested for infant use. The key differentiating fea-
tures and advantages of the OSS are depicted in Figure 1.
The sensor is powered by a small rechargeable bat-
tery and sends the acquired data via Bluetooth Low 
Energy (BLE) to a base station. The battery can last for 
up to 18 hours without charging. The BLE radio waves 
generated are considered safe for the infant as verified 
by a mandatory third-party testing.
The Wi-Fi–enabled base station serves as the primary 
notification system, emitting both visual and audible 
signals when changes in SpO2 occur and/or the HR 
becomes too high or too low. The OSS smartphone 
application allows parents to receive alerts on their 
phone (iPhones iOS 9 or later) and monitor their infant’s 
vital signs remotely (see Figure 1). In a case of a Red 
Alert, parents can immediately view the exact cause of 
the alert (ie, low oxygen or high or low HR).
The OSS stores recorded SpO2 levels and HR data in 
a secure cloud-based system. If the Wi-Fi or electricity 
becomes unavailable, the monitoring continues and 
stores vitals data locally, for up to 18 hours, until the 
connection is restored and the data are loaded into the 
cloud. Home alarms, cell phones, or other electronics do 
not interfere with the OSS.
Accuracy and reliability of the OSS have been tested 
against hospital-grade pulse oximeters as well as arterial 
blood gas samples according to standard FDA guidance. 
Using hospital-grade pulse oximeters as a reference, the 
OSS has the SpO2 accuracy of ±3% (70%-100% range) 
and HR accuracy of ±5 beats per minute (bpm; 30-300 
bpm range).
Vitals Data Collection
All Owlet Care users consented for data collection rele-
vant to the OSS, and strict data confidentiality was 
maintained. HR, SpO2, and movement data in the 2-sec-
ond resolution were collected and stored in a secure 
cloud database throughout the monitor use. All data 
related to alerts are preserved in the cloud database for 
retrospective analysis.
Description of OSS Alerts and Notifications 
System
A combination of an accelerometer and a proprietary 
algorithm of noise detection reduces the frequency of 
false alarms. The OSS notifications allow users to dif-
ferentiate between alerts caused by device malfunction 
and notifications caused by changed preset vital read-
ings. There are 5 types of alerts, each represented by a 
specific color that displays on the base station (see the 
appendix). The base station also sounds an 80-dB alarm 
[dB(A)/10 cm].
The Red Alert is the most critical and immediate of 
the OSS alarms. When the infant’s average HR dips 
below 60 bpm or exceeds 220 bpm or when the SpO2

a Industry standard measurement for radio wave absorption is known as specific absorption rate (SAR) and is measured in watts per kilogram 
of flesh (W/kg). The maximum safe SAR level set by the Federal Communications Commission (FCC) for transmitters on a human appendage 
is 4.0 W/kg. The OSS level is 0.0005 W/kg, which is 8000 times below the maximum safe threshold and more than 2000 times less than that of 
common cellular phones.

value drops below the 80% threshold, a Red Alert is 
issued. The processing algorithm limits the oxygen 
value to changing by no more than 1% SpO2 per second 
and the HR to changing by no more than 8 bpm/s, which 
is in accordance with physiological limits.
Results
Continuous readings of HR and SpO2 with a 2-s resolu-
tion were obtained from 39,626 full-term consecutive 
active OSS users between October 2015 and May 2017. 
Version 1.0 of the OSS was used in 65.6% of newborns; 
V2.0 became available in March 2017.
In addition, because of limitations in the initial data col-
lection methodology, a survey to describe demographics 
and OSS user demographics was conducted among all 
active OSS users in May 2017. The response rate was 
24.2%, and data on 5,125 users are summarized in Table 1.
Most parents (85%) used OSS for healthy full-term 
newborns, and 15% of monitored newborns were preterm 
children. Although data describe an early adopter of the 
OSS as likely being a first-time parent in their 30s with at 
least 1 college degree (“digital natives”), there were a few 
surprising findings. About 37% of Owlet users had at least 
1 parent working in the health care industry. Importantly, 
about a third of families using OSS were at or below the 
median income level, per US Census Bureau.7
A parental desire to know more about their child as 
well as a feeling of peace of mind accounted for 75% of 
the reasons to own the OSS. According to the survey 
results, parents felt significantly less anxious and 
reported better quality of sleep (96% and 94% of users, 
respectively). Safe Sleep Guidelines were followed by 
82% of parents. Per the survey, parent-reported history 
of SIDS (with the previous pregnancy or in the family) 
accounted for 8% of reasons for owning the OSS, and 
15% of parents used the OSS on their infants discharged 
from the neonatal intensive care unit (NICU).
Normative Physiological Readings
Because the accuracy of the self-reported gestational 
age of preterm infants was not verified, we report nor-
mative findings for SpO2 and HR in 39,626 full-term 
newborns only. The sock was worn primarily by infants 
in their sleep per the OSS user manual.
The normal average HR in full-term babies while 
sleeping is 136 bpm in the first month of postnatal life 
and 106 bpm at 12 months, consistent with reported 
physiological findings (see Table 2). The average SpO2 
in full-term babies varied slightly by months of age, 
with 96% in the first month of life and 97% at 12 months.

infants). According to our observation series, on aver-
age, a child was monitored for 6 months, 4.5 d/wk, and 
9.9 h/d. The OSS smartphone app was utilized 64% of 
the time.
Figure 2 demonstrates the total number of devices 
used at 1 point of time at each month of the infant’s life 
and average use of OSS per day throughout first 12 
months of life. The highest number of devices were acti-
vated between 0 and 1, and between 1 and 2 months of 
postnatal age. The total number of new devices activated 
each month is shown at the bottom of the data table.
Overall, OSS use started to decline between 5 and 6 
months of age; however, as the overall number of users 
decreased, the average duration of daily monitoring 
remained relatively constant. This may suggest overall 
positive parental experience with the OSS and/or possi-
bly exaggerated negative impact of the false alarm 
fatigue in the home setting.
False-Positive Alerts
For a typical night, most of the Red Alerts were for low 
oxygen (71%); fewer alerts were emitted for high HRs 
(18%) and low HRs (10%). For low oxygen events, arti-
facts usually lasted <20 s. For true alerts, the maximum 
raw SpO2 average value for the previous 20 s must have 
been less than 90 s, and the device must be transmitting 
at least 8 valid data points (out of 11) in the last 20 s. 
True bradycardias were associated with low oxygen lev-
els below 80% saturation.
In our experience, clinically significant alerts tended 
to be clustered and repeated. For instance, a child would 
have been alert-free for 6 months, but 10 alerts may 
occur during the first days of a respiratory syncytial 
virus (RSV) infection.
User-Reported Clinically Significant Red Alerts
Whereas the OSS registers all types of alerts for users, 
the company encourages caregivers to report experi-
ences related to clinically relevant Red Alerts. Also, 
Owlet reaches out to the caregivers and their physicians 
to gather and verify all relevant medical information 
associated with the Red Alert event when and if 
possible.
Since October 2015, Owlet has accumulated more 
than 80 parent-reported cases that led to either preven-
tion of a critical event or helped diagnose an overlooked 
condition. Of these, 49 events (61%) appeared clinically 
significant after verification with the health care pro-
vider and analysis of matching waveforms. The remain-
ing 39% of events were indeterminate (possible motion 
artifact, incorrect usage, or sparse data). The most com-
mon self-reported conditions that led to seeking medical

advice and/or a hospitalization were the following: 
Respiratory syncytial virus (n = 23), Supraventricular 
tachycardia (n = 7), breathing disturbances (laryngoma-
lacia, n = 7), obstructed airways caused by unsafe sleep 
practices (n = 5), congenital heart defect (n = 3), and 
apnea (n = 3).
Case Report: Apnea of Prematurity (AOP) in 
a 4-Day-Old Premature Infant
The following case report describes a preterm infant 
with AOP that led to a Red Alert. This case was verified 
with the neonatologist, and the clinical manifestation 
was matched with waveform readings from the OSS.
Description. A 4-day-old premature infant presented to 
the NICU with increasing apneas after birth (5 apnea 
episodes and 4 bradycardia/desaturation episodes with 
the need for a moderate stimulation or self-resolved) and 
was treated for AOP in the NICU for 8 days. Although 
the exact gestational age of the child was unclear, the 
prematurity of the newborn was confirmed by radiologi-
cal findings and was suspected to be at 36 weeks (late 
premature infant). The parents purchased the OSS 
before the child’s birth to allow for a smoother care tran-
sition at home.
After the OSS issued 5 low oxygen Red Alerts during 
the night, the newborn’s vital signs were checked by a 
nurse with a hospital monitor. The hospital monitor con-
firmed the OSS readings and that the child was experienc-
ing significant desaturation events while sleeping (Figure 
3). The infant was treated with caffeine and moderate 
continuous positive airway pressure therapy support.
Potential Role of OSS in AOP Detection and Surveil-
lance. AOP is a common problem affecting premature 
infants. The long-term consequences of severe, recur-
rent apnea-associated bradycardia and desaturation 
resulting in intermittent hypoxemia are not known; how-
ever, some authors have linked it8,9 with delayed mental 
development.
The potential uses of the OSS in premature infants 
are not limited to monitoring for AOP and bradycardia 
episodes; it may be a useful tool for studying the patho-
genesis and consequences of AOP, long-term risks, and 
optimization of the treatment regimens.
Discussion
Use of pulse oximetry and cardiorespiratory moni-
tors in the home setting has been long debated and 
has been a controversial topic ever since the

introduction of such monitors in early 1970s.6 The 
history is well summarized in a recent article by 
Freed and Martinez.6
The most common sentiment toward home-based 
cardiorespiratory monitoring was supported by the 
National Institutes of Health Development Conference 
in 1982 and later by the American Academy of 
Pediatrics (AAP) guidelines based mostly on results 
from the CHIME study conducted in 1998 and pub-
lished in 2001.5,10 In addition, the AAP Committee on 
the Fetus and Newborn presented recommendations 
related to the use of home cardiorespiratory monitoring 
in 2003 that discouraged its use for SIDS prevention or 
in healthy full-term infants, because of lack of proven 
benefits, and focused on the high-risk newborn popula-
tion (high-risk premature and technology-dependent 
infants using monitors equipped with event recorder).5 
The committee encouraged pediatricians to continue to 
promote proven practices that decrease the risk of 
SIDS, per recommendations.
Freed and Martinez6 provided data from a compre-
hensive home cardiorespiratory monitoring program 
of more than 35,000 infants from August 1998 to 
December 2016. Their most recent hypothesis about 
the utility of cardiorespiratory monitoring suggests 
that the monitoring of a select group of infants who are 
at risk for episodes of intermittent hypoxemia has 
merit and bears serious consideration.6 Other investi-
gators have also demonstrated the utility of home 
pulse oximetry in at-risk infants,11 including late pre-
term infants.9 A study by Seddon et al12 using plethys-
mography recorded by pulse oximetry demonstrated 
the feasibility of this technique for monitoring of pre-
term infants in the home.
The purpose of this article was to present large 
reported experience with the OSS device as suggested in 
a recent viewpoint feature by Bonafide et al3 in January 
2017. Authors warned that the commercial marketing of 
home cardiorespiratory monitors and pulse oximeters 
such as the OSS “may cause unnecessary fear, uncer-
tainty, and self-doubt in parents.” Since the introduction 
of home monitors as summarized by Freed and 
Martinez,6 there has been concern that the false alarms 
would cause anxiety and psychological stress in parents. 
More recent technology such as pulse oximetry is very 
sensitive, and close attention needs to be paid to how 
these monitors’ limits are set.
Readings, registration, and storage of the data on 
SpO2 and HR in 2-s resolution with continuously evolv-
ing proprietary algorithms that reduce false alarms rep-
resents a significant opportunity to explore benefits of 
the home-based monitoring as part of comprehensive 
home-based care programs.
As Owlet continues to work on the application as a 
class-II medical device, we believe that multiparameter 
monitoring of basic vital signs in infants has applications 
for daily life management, clinical practice, and biomed-
ical research. This strategy of the OSS is in keeping with 
the suggestion also made by Bonafide et al3 regarding the 
standardization of these devices. Contemporary health 
monitoring systems represents tools that provide an early 
indication of changing patient status, thus allowing for 
quick and timely intervention.
The key to this discussion is to highlight the capabili-
ties that modern technology like the OSS offer, as well 
as the plethora of unanswered questions and implica-
tions for medical management and public health.
Conclusions
A fast and continuous pace of OSS adoption (>100 000 
units used to date) suggests excellent parental accep-
tance and experience. When combined with technologi-
cal advances of the system for continuous nonobtrusive 
monitoring in newborns, overall advantages of the OSS 
could be leveraged into solving important clinical and 
public health problems. Future prospective randomized 
clinical trials are warranted to further validate the impact 
of the OSS technology in healthy and high-risk new-
borns in clinical and home settings.
Limitations
Limitations of the current publication include the 
following:
1. 
it was a retrospective descriptive analysis of a 
self-selected population of early adopters of the 
OSS technology; and
2. 
incomplete and missing data on the key demo-
graphic and other characteristics at the initial 
stages of the OSS adoption significantly reduced 
the analyzed sample from the overall OSS user 
base.
Future Goals
In September 2017, Owlet Baby Care, Inc. launched the 
Connected Care accessory platform that will allow his-
torical data tracking and trending, such as a 24-hour, 
1-week, and 1-month view of HR and SpO2, sleep pat-
terns, and detailed Red Alerts information. Parents may 
share this information with their physicians.
A broad clinical program has been set up to validate 
the OSS technology and assess its value in enabling 
insights into diagnosis and postdischarge surveillance for

Apparent  
Life-Threatening 
Events (ALTEs), and other conditions. The company 
 
collaborates with established investigators in prospective 
studies with FDA-approved pulse oximetry devices.

and the baby is being actively 
monitored. Both heart rate and 
oxygen levels are in the preset range
White
Static white: sensor package is plugged 
in and charging
Yellow
