BACKGROUND: SPRINT (Systolic Blood Pressure Intervention Trial) 
demonstrated a 27% reduction in all-cause mortality with a systolic blood 
pressure (SBP) goal of <120  versus <140 mm 
Hg among US adults at 
high cardiovascular disease risk but without diabetes mellitus, stroke, or 
heart failure. To quantify the potential benefits and risks of SPRINT intensive 
goal implementation, we estimated the deaths prevented and excess 
serious adverse events incurred if the SPRINT intensive SBP treatment goal 
were implemented in all eligible US adults.
METHODS: SPRINT eligibility criteria were applied to the 1999 to 2006 
National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey and linked with the National 
Death Index through December 2011. SPRINT eligibility included age ≥50 
years, SBP of 130 to 180 mm 
Hg (depending on the number of antihypertensive 
medications being taken), and high cardiovascular disease risk. Exclusion 
criteria were diabetes mellitus, history of stroke, >1 g proteinuria, heart failure, 
estimated glomerular filtration rate <20 mL·min−1·1.73 m−2, or dialysis. Annual 
mortality rates were calculated by dividing the Kaplan-Meier 5-year mortality 
by 5. Hazard ratios for all-cause mortality and heart failure and absolute risks 
for serious adverse events in SPRINT were used to estimate the number of 
potential deaths and heart failure cases prevented and serious adverse events 
incurred with intensive SBP treatment.
RESULTS: The mean age was 68.6 years, and 83.2% and 7.4% were non-
Hispanic white and non-Hispanic black, respectively. The annual mortality 
rate was 2.20% (95% confidence interval [CI], 1.91–2.48), and intensive 
SBP treatment was projected to prevent ≈107 
500 deaths per year (95% 
CI, 93 
300–121 
200) and give rise to 56 
100 (95% CI, 50 
800–61 
400) 
episodes of hypotension, 34 
400 (95% CI, 31 
200–37 
600) episodes of 
syncope, 43 
400 (95% CI, 39 
400–47 
500) serious electrolyte disorders, 
and 88 
700 (95% CI, 80 
400–97 
000) cases of acute kidney injury per year. 
The analysis-of-extremes approach indicated that the range of estimated 
lower- and upper-bound number of deaths prevented per year with intensive 
SBP control was 34 
600 to 179 
600. Intensive SBP control was projected 
to prevent 46 
100 (95% CI, 41 
800–50 
400) cases of heart failure annually.
CONCLUSIONS: If fully implemented in eligible US adults, intensive SBP 
treatment could prevent ≈107 
500 deaths per year. A consequence of this 
treatment strategy, however, could be an increase in serious adverse events.

H
igh blood pressure (BP) is the leading modifiable 
cardiovascular disease (CVD) risk factor world-
wide.1 Observational studies show a monotonic 
increase in risk of CVD beginning at a systolic BP (SBP) 
of 115 mm 
Hg.2 However, the optimal SBP threshold for 
antihypertensive medication initiation and goal attain-
ment is unclear. Current US recommendations are an 
SBP threshold of 140 or 150 mm 
Hg for initiation of an-
tihypertensive medication, depending on age and other 
coexisting conditions.3 Until recently, randomized trials 
did not provide definitive evidence supporting lower SBP 
goals in high-risk subpopulations.3–5
SPRINT (Systolic Blood Pressure Intervention Trial) 
was designed to determine whether lowering SBP to an 
intensive goal of <120 mm 
Hg compared with the stan-
dard goal of <140 mm 
Hg resulted in reduced CVD risk 
in high-risk patients without a history of diabetes mel-
litus, stroke, or heart failure.6 SPRINT achieved a mean 
SBP of 121 mm 
Hg in the intensive treatment arm and 
136 mm 
Hg in the standard treatment arm, resulting in a 
27% reduction (hazard ratio [HR], 0.73; 95% confidence 
interval [CI], 0.60–0.90) in all-cause mortality.7 Given the 
mortality rate observed in SPRINT, only 90 SPRINT-eligi-
ble patients need to be treated to an intensive SBP goal 
to prevent 1 death resulting from any cause after 3.26 
years.7 However, participants in the intensive SBP treat-
ment group experienced a higher incidence of treatment-
related serious adverse events (SAEs), and the number 
needed to harm for any SAE possibly or definitely related 
to the intervention was 45.
Implementation of SPRINT-based intensive SBP goals 
has the potential to greatly reduce mortality in patients at 
high CVD risk living in the United States and worldwide. 
To quantify the potential benefits and risks of SPRINT 
intensive goal implementation, we estimated the deaths 
prevented and excess SAEs incurred if the SPRINT inten-
sive SBP goal were implemented in all eligible US adults.
METHODS
Study Population
Data were drawn from the NHANES (National Health and 
Nutrition Examination Survey), a multistage, stratified prob-
ability sample of noninstitutionalized US adults conducted 
by the National Center for Health Statistics.4 To provide suf-
ficient sample size, data were pooled from the 1999 to 2000, 
2001 to 2002, 2003 to 2004, and 2005 to 2006 NHANES 
cycles.8 Participants who completed a medical evaluation at 
the NHANES mobile examination center, were ≥20 years of 
age, and had complete information on SBP measurements and 
use of antihypertensive medication (n=17 
746) were included. 
Of the 8327 NHANES participants who were ≥50 years old, 
4249 met SPRINT SBP criteria (Figure 1). Next, participants 
who did not meet the high CVD risk criteria (n=895) or who had 
diabetes mellitus (n=868), history of stroke (n=263), protein-
uria >1 g/d (n=53), heart failure (n=228), estimated glomeru-
lar filtration rate (eGFR) <20 mL·min−1·1.73 m−2, or end-stage 
renal disease on dialysis (n=30) were excluded. After these 
exclusions, a total of 2185 SPRINT-eligible participants were 
included in the current analyses. All participants provided 
written informed consent, and the National Center for Health 
Statistics institutional review board approved each NHANES 
cycle.
Baseline Data Collection
In each NHANES cycle, data were collected via a medical 
evaluation and participant interviews. The participant interview 
collected self-reported data on age, race/ethnicity, sex, smok-
ing status, history of a diagnosis of diabetes mellitus, heart 
failure, hypertension, myocardial infarction, angina, coronary 
heart disease, or stroke, as well as receipt of dialysis in the 
past 12 months or the use of antihypertensive or antidiabetes 
medication.
The NHANES medical evaluation included measurements 
of height and weight that were used to calculate body mass 
index. A blood sample was collected for measurement of 
serum creatinine, glucose, and glycosylated hemoglobin 
(hemoglobin A1c). Urine albumin and creatinine concentrations 
were analyzed from spot random urine samples. Diabetes 
mellitus was defined by a prior diagnosis, excluding during 
pregnancy, with concurrent use of insulin or oral hypoglycemic 
medication or a hemoglobin A1c ≥6.5%, nonfasting glucose 
≥200 mg/dL, or fasting glucose ≥126 mg/dL. The CKD-EPI 
(Chronic Kidney Disease Epidemiology Collaboration) equation 
was used to calculate eGFR.9 NHANES participants were asked 
to bring all prescription medications taken in the past 2 weeks 
to their NHANES medical evaluation. Trained study personnel 
reviewed the pill bottles, and medication names were recoded 
into medication classes according to their generic equivalents. 
Clinical Perspective
What Is New?
• In this population-based study, if fully implemented 
in eligible US adults, intensive blood pressure treat-
ment was projected to prevent ≈107 
500 deaths 
per year and give rise to ≈56 
100 episodes of 
hypotension, 34 
400 episodes of syncope, 43 
400 
serious electrolyte disorders, and 88 
700 cases of 
acute kidney injury per year compared with standard 
blood pressure treatment.
What Are the Clinical Implications?
• If fully implemented in eligible US adults with 
raised blood pressure and at high risk for car-
diovascular disease, intensive blood pressure 
treatment has the potential to prevent ≈107 500 
deaths per year compared with standard blood 
pressure treatment.
• Careful patient selection and implementation are 
important because intensive treatment is associ-
ated with increased risk of hypotension, syncope, 
electrolyte abnormalities, and acute kidney injury.

Use of antihypertensive medication was defined by self-report 
and report of taking ≥1 classes of antihypertensive medication 
identified through the pill bottle review.
Baseline BP Measurement
BP was measured with participants seated after 5 minutes of 
rest by a trained study physician using a mercury sphygmo-
manometer with an appropriately sized cuff. SBP and diastolic 
BP were defined as the mean of 3 BP measurements taken 1 
minute apart.
Death Ascertainment
Mortality follow-up for the NHANES participants was available 
through December 31, 2011. To identify vital status, probabi-
listic matching was used to link NHANES participants with the 
National Death Index. Matching was based on 12 identifiers 
for each participant, including data of birth, sex, and Social 
Security number. The follow-up period for each participant was 
calculated as the interval between their NHANES evaluation 
and the data of death or December 31, 2011, for participants 
who did not die.
Statistical Analysis
Annual mortality rates in the SPRINT-eligible population over-
all and within subgroups defined by sex, age (<75 and ≥75 
years), race/ethnicity, history of coronary heart disease, SBP 
groups (≤132, 133–144, and ≥145 mm 
Hg; prespecified SBP 
strata defined in SPRINT), and eGFR of 20 to 59 mL·min−1·1.73 
m−2 were calculated. The Kaplan-Meier method was used to 
calculate the 5-year survival probability, which was then used 
to calculate the 5-year mortality, which is equal to 1 minus the 
5-year survival probability, which amounts to the 5-year cumu-
lative incidence (under the exponential model approximation). 
The annual mortality rate was then approximated by dividing 
this probability by 5. Population estimates for annual deaths in 
the overall population meeting the SPRINT eligibility criteria and 
in subgroups were determined by multiplying the population 
size for that group or subgroup by their respective annual all-
cause mortality rate. The projected annual number of deaths 
that would occur if SPRINT intensive SBP goals were fully imple-
mented was determined by multiplying the observed annual 
mortality rate and its 95% CIs in the overall SPRINT-eligible 
NHANES population by 0.73, the observed HR for all-cause 
mortality with intensive SBP treatment in SPRINT compared with 
standard SBP treatment (ie, usual care).7 This was done for the 
overall population and within subgroups defined by sex, age 
(<75 and ≥75 years), race/ethnicity, history of coronary heart 
disease, SBP groups (≤132, 133–144, and ≥145 mm 
Hg), and 
moderate stage chronic kidney disease (defined by SPRINT as 
eGFR of 20–59 mL·min−1·1.73 m−2). Deaths postponed were 
then calculated as the difference between total and expected 
deaths with full implementation of intensive SBP treatment. 
Because the oscillometric BP measurement methods used in 
SPRINT by research personnel may result in a lower mean SBP 
than observed using manual auscultatory method by physi-
cians in NHANES, we performed a sensitivity analysis including 
the NHANES population with a 10– and 20–mm 
Hg higher SBP 
than the SPRINT entry criteria (eg, 140 to 190 and 150 to 
200 versus 130 to 180 mm 
Hg for those on 0 or 1 antihyper-
tensive medication, respectively.10 Because heart failure was 
the component of the primary composite outcome in SPRINT 
that was statistically significantly different between treatment 
groups, we also estimated the number of new cases of heart 
failure prevented by multiplying the HR for incident heart failure 
observed in SPRINT (0.62) by the number of heart failure cases 
expected with standard SBP treatment. The number of heart 
failure cases expected with standard SBP treatment was cal-
culated by dividing the annual rate of rate incident heart failure 
observed in SPRINT (0.67%/y) by the SPRINT-eligible NHANES 
population size and it’s 95% confidence interval overall and 
within subgroups.
SAEs were defined in SPRINT as an event that was fatal or 
life-threatening that resulted in clinically significant or persis-
tent disability, required or prolonged a hospitalization, or was 
judged by the investigator to represent a clinically significant 
hazard or harm to the participant that might require interven-
tion to prevent another SAE. To project the number of SAEs 
expected with intensive SBP treatment, we multiplied the abso-
lute risk difference for each SAE of interest reported in the 
main SPRINT report that was statistically significantly differ-
ent between intensive and standard SBP treatment arms (ie, 
hypotension, syncope, bradycardia, electrolyte abnormality, 
and acute kidney injury) by the number of US adults meeting 
the SPRINT eligibility criteria.7 This was done for these SAEs 
overall and for these SAEs classified as possibly or definitely 
related to the intervention. This number was then divided by 
3.26 (the median years of follow-up in SPRINT) to yield the 
Figure 1. Flowchart showing the SPRINT (Systolic 
Blood Pressure Intervention Trial) eligibility criteria 
applied to the NHANES (National Health and Nutrition 
Examination Survey), 1999 to 2006.  
CHD indicates coronary heart disease; and CVD, cardiovascular 
disease.

projected SAEs incurred per year. To account for the uncer-
tainty in treatment effects from SPRINT, sensitivity analyses 
were conducted with the analysis-of-extremes methodology 
in which the upper and lower confidence bounds of the treat-
ment effects for all-cause mortality, heart failure, and SAEs 
were used.11,12 Because confidence bounds were not available 
for SAEs in the SPRINT main results publication, we calculated 
95% CIs for SAEs from the P value (Table I in the online-only 
Data Supplement). The number needed to treat was calcu-
lated for all-cause mortality and heart failure, and the number 
needed to harm was calculated for each individual SAE by tak-
ing the reciprocal of the absolute reduction in risk overall and 
within subgroups. SUDAAN 10.1 (Research Triangle Institute, 
Research Triangle Park, NC) was used for all analyses to 
account for the complex sampling design of NHANES.
RESULTS
For the years between 1999 and 2006, an estimated 
18.1 million (95% CI, 16.4–19.8 million) US adults met 
the SPRINT eligibility criteria, including 7.4 million (95% 
CI, 6.5–8.3 million) and 10.7 million (95% CI, 9.9–11.5 
million) who were taking and not taking antihypertensive 
medication, respectively. The mean age in the sample 
was 68.6 years, with 32.0% being ≥75 years of age 
(Table 1). More than half (53.8%) were men;  83.2% were 
non-Hispanic white; 7.4% were non-Hispanic black, and 
3.0% were Mexican American.
The overall observed annual mortality of the study 
population was 2.20% (95% CI, 1.91–2.48), resulting in 
398 
200 projected deaths per year (95% CI, 345 
700–
448 
900) with standard SBP treatment (ie, usual care; 
Table 2). On the basis of the HR for all-cause mortal-
ity observed in SPRINT, intensive SBP treatment was 
projected to decrease annual mortality to 1.61% (95% 
CI, 1.39–1.81), resulting in 290 
700 deaths per year 
(95% CI, 252 
400–327 
700). We estimate that 107 
500 
deaths (95% CI, 93 
300–121 
200) could be prevented 
annually with full implementation of intensive SBP treat-
ment in this group of SPRINT-eligible US adults. After 
accounting for the uncertainty of the HR for all-cause 
mortality in SPRINT in the analysis-of-extremes sensitiv-
ity analysis, the range of estimated lower- and upper-
bound number of deaths prevented per year with inten-
sive SBP treatment was 34 
600 to 179 
600 (Table II in 
the online-only Data Supplement). In sensitivity analyses, 
84 
000 (95% CI, 73 
600–95 
700) and 62 
700 (95% CI, 
55 
400–71 
300) deaths could be averted with intensive 
SBP treatment when we required SBP to be 10  and 
20 mm 
Hg higher than the SPRINT entry criteria, respec-
tively (Figures I and II and Tables III–VI in the online-only 
Data Supplement).
The observed annual mortality among the SPRINT-
eligible population taking antihypertensive medication 
was 2.03% (95% CI, 1.58–2.49; Table 3). Within this 
group, intensive SBP treatment could reduce annual 
mortality to 1.48%/y (95% CI, 1.15–1.82), resulting in 
a projected decrease of 40 
600 deaths per year (95% 
CI, 31 
600–49 
800). Among those who were SPRINT-el-
igible and not currently taking antihypertensive medica-
tion, the observed annual mortality was 2.31% (95% CI, 
1.89–2.73). Intensive SBP treatment was projected to 
prevent 66 
700 deaths per year among this group (95% 
CI, 54 
600–78 
900).
The highest annual mortality rate was noted for 
SPRINT-eligible US adults ≥75 years of age, among 
whom intensive SBP treatment could prevent 67 
300 
(95% CI, 58 
600–77 
200) deaths per year. SPRINT-eligi-
ble US adults with an eGFR of 20 to 59 mL·min−1·1.73 
m−2 had annual mortality rates of 3.02% (95% CI, 
2.18–4.16) if taking antihypertensive medication and 
2.88% (95% CI, 2.15–3.84) if not taking antihyperten-
sive medication, yielding total annual deaths of 121 
000 
(95% CI, 97 
200–149 
700). Intensive SBP treatment 
among SPRINT-eligible US adults with an eGFR of 20 to 
59 mL·min−1·1.73 m−2 was projected to prevent 32 
700 
(95% CI, 26 
200–40 
400) deaths per year.
Intensive SBP treatment was projected to prevent 
46 
100 (95% CI, 41 
800–50 
400) new cases of heart 
failure annually (Table VII in the online-only Data Supple-
ment). After accounting for uncertainty in both the esti-
mates for the population size and treatment effect on in-
cident heart failure, intensive SBP treatment is projected 
to prevent between 17 
600 and 73 
000 new cases of 
heart failure per year.
Among SPRINT-eligible US adults overall, standard 
SBP treatment (ie, usual care) could lead to 77 
800 
(95% CI, 70 
500–85 
100) episodes of hypotension, 
94 
100 (95% CI, 85 
300–103 
000) episodes of syncope, 
128 
500 (95% CI, 116 
400–140 
600) electrolyte abnor-
malities, and 139 
400 (95% CI, 126 
300–152 
500) cas-
es of acute kidney injury per year (Table 4 and Figure 2). 
In this same group, intensive SBP treatment is projected 
to result in 56 
100 (95% CI, 50 
800–61 
400) additional 
episodes of hypotension, 34 
400 (95% CI, 31 
200–
37 
600) additional episodes of syncope, 43 
400 (95% 
CI, 39 
400–47 
500) additional electrolyte abnormalities, 
and 88 
700 (95% CI, 80 
400–97 
000) additional cases 
of acute kidney injury per year. The analysis-of-extremes 
sensitivity analyses for SAEs are shown in Table VIII in the 
online-only Data Supplement.
DISCUSSION
In the present analysis, we project that ≈107 
500 deaths 
could be averted annually if an intensive SBP target goal 
of <120 mm 
Hg were to be adopted among all US adults 
meeting the SPRINT eligibility criteria. To provide con-
text, this number represents nearly 20% of the 614 
348 
Americans who died of heart disease in 2014.13 More-
over, projections from the present study indicate that the 
number of deaths that could be prevented with intensive 
SBP treatment in eligible US adults is similar to that of

another public health strategy of dietary salt reduction in

Obesity is defined as body mass index ≥30.0 kg/m2. Framingham Risk Score was calculated with the equation for general clinical 
practice. 13 Use of antihypertensive medication was defined by self-report and report of taking ≥1 classes of antihypertensive 
medication identified through the pill bottle review.

The magnitude of the potential benefit estimated can 
be conceptualized in practical terms by recognizing that 
the number needed to treat from SPRINT to prevent 2 
death resulting from any cause was 90 over 3.26 years.7 
Although varying assumptions could change our overall 
estimate, the combination of a low number needed to 
treat (ie, 90 over 3.26 years) and the large number of 
US adults meeting the SPRINT eligibility criteria supports 
the contention that an impact in the range of 100 
000

interventions are currently available that could have such 
a large and immediate public health impact on broad 
sectors of the US adult population. Adding to the evi-
dence supporting intensive SBP target goals in the gen-
eral population, a recent meta-analysis of 34 BP-lowering 
trials comparing intensive and standard BP lowering, in-
cluding SPRINT, found that the direction of effect was 
consistent across the component trials and that overall 
more intensive SBP lowering significantly reduced the 
risk of CVD events and stroke compared with standard 
SBP lowering.15
Intensive BP treatment involves the potential risk of 
SAEs, especially in the elderly. Both the relative and ab-
solute CVD and all-cause mortality risk reductions were 
greater in SPRINT participants ≥75 years of age, regard-
less of frailty status at baseline.16 The HR among partici-
pants >75 years of age at entry was 0.67 for all-cause 
mortality, and on the basis of the 3-year interval of the 
trial, only 27 patients would need to be treated with the 
intensive SBP control to prevent the primary SPRINT out-
come of CVD, whereas treatment of 41 people would 
prevent a death.16
SPRINT provided detailed estimates of SAEs, virtually 
all of which were either without lasting consequence or 
reversible with dose de-escalation. Even in participants 
≥75 years of age, SAEs related to hypotension were 
only slightly increased in the intensive group, an excess 
that did not reach statistical significance.16 Together with 
past results from HYVET (Hypertension in the Very Elderly 
Trial) and SHEP (Systolic Hypertension in the Elderly Pro-
gram), the SPRINT results in elderly participants support 
a recommendation of the same BP treatment goals in 
young adults and most elderly patients.17,18 At the same 
time, neither SPRINT nor NHANES studied institutional-
ized elderly patients; intensive goals may not be appro-
priate in such patients until more evidence emerges.
Reduction in CVD risk factor levels through primary 
and secondary prevention has accounted for the ma-
jority of the 80% decline in CVD deaths in the United 
States and many other countries over the last several 
decades.19,20 Recently, however, it appears that the 
decline in CVD in the United States has slowed.21 More 
aggressive use of the available safe, effective, and inex-
pensive antihypertensive medications to reduce SBP to 
<120 mm 
Hg among eligible US adults may restore the 
downward trend in CVD mortality that has transformed 
adult health in the United States over the last 50 years.
Intensive SBP treatment in patients with diabetes 
mellitus yielded more equivocal evidence in the AC-
CORD Trial (Action to Control Cardiovascular Risk in 
Diabetes). Therefore, there is uncertainty as to whether 
the benefits observed in SPRINT extend to patients with 
diabetes mellitus.4 However, a recent meta-analysis in-
cluding ACCORD and other BP-lowering trials in patients 
with diabetes mellitus estimated significant CVD and all-
cause mortality reductions with lower SBP target goals 
in patients with diabetes mellitus, with no evidence of 
diminished risk reductions below 130 mm 
Hg.22 On the 
contrary, another meta-analysis of BP trials found an 
attenuation of the treatment effect in people with diabe-
tes mellitus when SBP was lowered to <130 mm 
Hg.23

treatment in patients with diabetes mellitus, with out-
come definitions more similar to those in SPRINT, is 
urgently needed.
Implementation of the SPRINT intensive regimen will re-
quire overcoming a number of obstacles. Because SPRINT 
was a practice-based trial and recruited patients from clin-
ics, it is unclear how likely it is that intensive SBP goals will 
be achieved among population-based free-dwelling adults. 
It is likely that an additional investment will be required 
from providers and patients (eg, more frequent clinic visits,

CI indicates confidence interval; SAE, serious adverse event; SBP systolic blood pressure; and SPRINT, Systolic Blood Pressure Intervention Trial.
*Calculated by multiplying the annual SAE rate by 18 100 000 and its 95% CI (16 400 000–19 800 000), which is the number of US adults meeting the 
sprint eligibility criteria from 1999 to 2006. †Calculated by multiplying the risk difference for each SAE by 18 100 000, which is the number of US adults 
meeting the sprint eligibility criteria from 1999 to 2006. Acute kidney injury or acute renal failure was defined in SPRINT as an event that occurred during 
a hospitalization and were reported in the hospital discharge summary as a primary or main secondary diagnosis.
†An SAE was defined in SPRINT as an event that was fatal or life-threatening, that resulted in clinically significant or persistent disability, that required or 
prolonged a hospitalization, or that was judged by the investigator to represent a clinically significant hazard or harm to the participant that might require 
medical or surgical intervention to prevent another SAE.
Figure 2. Potential number of serious adverse events (SAEs) per year with standard and intensive systolic blood 
pressure (SBP) control among NHANES (National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey) participants who 
meet the SPRINT (Systolic Blood Pressure Intervention Trial) eligibility criteria. 
Projected number of SAEs from standard and intensive SBP control were calculated by taking the observed SAE rate in SPRINT 
and dividing it by 3.26 (the median follow-up in SPRINT) and then multiplying it by 18 
100 
000, which is the number of US adults 
meeting the SPRINT eligibility criteria from 1999 to 2006. Vertical lines denote the upper limit of the 95% confidence interval.

laboratory testing, and additional medications) to produce 
the mean SBP change achieved in SPRINT (14.8 mm 
Hg 
after 1 year of treatment). Integrated health systems such 
as Kaiser Permanente of Northern California are already 
achieving control rates of >90% for SBP and diastolic BP 
targets goals of <140/90 mm 
Hg.24,25 However, consis-
tent with the history of implementing evidence from virtu-
ally any new trial that substantially challenges established 
practice, reluctance to implement an SBP goal of <120 
mm 
Hg could be encountered among some healthcare 
providers for months and possibly years because of worry 
about SAEs and simple clinical inertia. Cognitive bias that 
weights negative consequences of a preventive therapy 
more heavily than long-term benefit is common in provid-
ers. Patients treated to intensive goals will require care-
ful monitoring to avoid hypotension, syncope, electrolyte 
abnormalities, or acute kidney injury. Active involvement 
of patients who desire a CVD-free life despite a small risk 
of an SAE may be a positive force to overcome providers’ 
resistance to change and clinical inertia.
This report draws on several major strengths. NHANES 
provides accurate estimates of the target US adult popu-
lation and has enrolled a large sample size, allowing us 
to conduct analyses in several subgroups. Inclusions and 
exclusions did not exactly match because NHANES did 
not have information on some of the SPRINT eligibility cri-
teria (ie, the presence of reduced left ventricular ejection 
fraction, coronary calcium score, ankle-brachial index, or 
left ventricular hypertrophy) or a history of medication 
nonadherence. SPRINT excluded individuals whose SBP 
was <110 mm 
Hg after 1 minute of standing. Because 
standing BP was not obtained in NHANES, these indi-
viduals could not be excluded from the current analysis. 
There also was a higher percentage of black participants 
in SPRINT than in the SPRINT-eligible NHANES sample 
in the present analysis. Because there were no statisti-
cally significant interactions in prespecified subgroups in 
SPRINT, we assumed no heterogeneity of treatment ef-
fect across these subgroups. The observed mortality was 
substantially higher in the US population meeting SPRINT 
criteria compared with SPRINT. The likely reason is that 
volunteers for clinical trials, including SPRINT, tend to 
be healthier than the general population. As a result, the 
smaller absolute mortality reduction observed in this trial 
may lead to an underestimate of preventable deaths in the 
population. Likewise, it could have led to underestimation 
of SAE rates. Both SPRINT and NHANES used the mean 
of 3 BP measurements after 5 minutes of seated rest; 
however, SPRINT used an automated device (model 907, 
Omron Healthcare), whereas NHANES used a mercury 
sphygmomanometer. Unless an automated office BP with-
out an observer being present is taken, usual clinic SBP 
could be expected to be ≈10 mm 
Hg higher than usual, 
observed clinic BP.10,26,27 The results of sensitivity analysis 
requiring SBP levels to be 10 and 20 mm 
Hg higher than 
the SPRINT entry criteria indicated that a somewhat small-
er number of deaths would be averted with intensive SBP 
treatment (≈63–84 thousand deaths averted per year). 
However, the projected number of deaths averted as a 
result of intensive treatment would remain high.
CONCLUSIONS
The present analysis projects that if the intensive SBP 
treatment studied in SPRINT were widely adopted in eli-
gible, high-CVD-risk US adults, ≈107 
500 deaths could be 
prevented annually. This benefit must be balanced against 
an increased risk of SAEs, including a projected 56 
100 
and 88 
700 additional cases per year of hypotension and 
acute kidney injury incurred with intensive SBP treatment.
