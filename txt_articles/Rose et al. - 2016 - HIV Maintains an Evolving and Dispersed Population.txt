ABSTRACT
While combined antiretroviral therapy (cART) can result in undetectable plasma viral loads, it does not eradicate HIV infection.
Furthermore, HIV-infected individuals while on cART remain at an increased risk of developing serious comorbidities, such as
cancer, neurological disease, and atherosclerosis, suggesting that during cART, tissue-based HIV may contribute to such pathol-
ogies. We obtained DNA and RNA env, nef, and pol sequences using single-genome sequencing from postmortem tissues of three
HIV� cART-treated (cART�) individuals with undetectable viral load and metastatic cancer at death and performed time-scaled
Bayesian evolutionary analyses. We used a sensitive in situ hybridization technique to visualize HIV gag-pol mRNA transcripts
in cerebellum and lymph node tissues from one patient. Tissue-associated virus evolved at similar rates in cART� and cART-
naive (cART�) patients. Phylogenetic trees were characterized by two distinct features: (i) branching patterns consistent with
constant viral evolution and dispersal among tissues and (ii) very recently derived clades containing both DNA and RNA se-
quences from multiple tissues. Rapid expansion of virus near death corresponded to wide-spread metastasis. HIV RNA� cells
clustered in cerebellum tissue but were dispersed in lymph node tissue, mirroring the evolutionary patterns observed for that
patient. Activated, infiltrating macrophages were associated with HIV RNA. Our data provide evidence that tissues serve as a
sanctuary for wild-type HIV during cART and suggest the importance of macrophages as an alternative reservoir and mecha-
nism of virus spread.
IMPORTANCE
Combined antiretroviral therapy (cART) reduces plasma HIV to undetectable levels; however, removal of cART results in plasma
HIV rebound, thus highlighting its inability to entirely rid the body of infection. Additionally, HIV-infected individuals on
cART remain at high risk of serious diseases, which suggests a contribution from residual HIV. In this study, we isolated and
sequenced HIV from postmortem tissues from three HIV� cART� individuals who died with metastatic cancer and had no de-
tectable plasma viral load. Using high-resolution evolutionary analyses, we found that tissue-based HIV continues to replicate,
evolve, and migrate among tissues during cART. Furthermore, cancer onset and metastasis coincided with increased HIV expan-
sion, suggesting a linked mechanism. HIV-expressing cells were associated with tissue macrophages, a target of HIV infection.
Our results suggest the importance of tissues, and macrophages in particular, as a target for novel anti-HIV therapies.
A
lthough current combined antiretroviral therapy (cART) reg-
imens can extend the lives of individuals infected with human
immunodeficiency virus (HIV) by years or decades, two major
problems remain. First, HIV is never eradicated in treated patients
and plasma viral loads (VL) will rebound if treatment is stopped.
Subsets of T cells (1–7) and lymph (8, 9) are considered likely
reservoirs of virus during cART. Virus obtained from circulating T
cells during suppressive therapy showed a lack of evolution com-
pared to pretherapy virus, suggesting maintenance through la-
tency rather than replication (10, 11). On the other hand, virus
from lymph nodes appears to continue to evolve throughout ther-
apy (9) and is a heterogeneous population (8, 9). These contrast-
ing patterns suggest multiple evolutionary strategies for mainte-
nance during cART.
Second, significant HIV comorbidities, including cancer, lipid
disorders, and neurological diseases, develop in cART-treated
(cART�) patients at a higher rate than in the general population,
despite fully suppressed VL and restored immunity. Of the major
HIV-related comorbidities, cancer is the leading cause of death for
HIV-infected (HIV�), cART-treated patients (12–14). However,

 the relationship between HIV infection, tumor growth, and me-
tastasis is still largely unknown. In a previous study, we sequenced
HIV DNA from tumor and nontumor postmortem tissues from
two cART-naive (cART�) patients and found that virus in tumors
was evolutionarily distinct from virus in nontumor tissues (15).
We also recently quantified viral DNA in more than 65% of post-
mortem tissue samples obtained from a cohort of 20 HIV-infected
patients who were virally suppressed at death, 15 of whom were
diagnosed with cancer during treatment and/or at autopsy. HIV
DNA was detected in 12 different anatomical locations, including
tumor sites. Complete clinical details of the study are reported
elsewhere (16).
From this unique cohort, we selected a subset of five cancer
patients to characterize tissue-based virus. We extracted HIV
DNA and RNA from tissues and used single-genome sequencing
to obtain a 3,000-bp region of the HIV genome spanning env
through nef. We investigated whether viral populations were dis-
persed among tissues, if the viral populations were evolving dur-
ing cART, and whether viral dynamics were associated with devel-
opment and spread of cancer.
MATERIALS AND METHODS
NNAB participants. National Neurological AIDS Bank (NNAB) partici-
pants are recruited from the greater Los Angeles, CA, area. An institu-
tional review board (IRB)-approved informed consent is obtained from
each participant or his/her legal guardian. Eligibility criteria are as follows.
Participants must be aged 18 years or older and agree to participate in
study examinations and donation of blood, urine, and (optional) cerebro-
spinal fluid (CSF) during life and to donate their brain and other tissues
for research in the event of their death. HIV-positive (HIV�) participants
are selected because they have one or more of the following: a CD4� cell
count of �50 cells/mm3, systemic lymphoma or another widespread ma-
lignancy, Mycobacterium avium complex infection, wasting with loss of
�30% of body weight, primary central nervous system (CNS) lymphoma,
progressive multifocal leukoencephalopathy, congestive heart failure,
chronic renal failure with potential or current need for dialysis, chronic
obstructive pulmonary disease, end-stage liver disease, serum albumin
of �3.2 g/dl, or any condition which, in the opinion of the study physi-
cian, is likely to lead to death within the period of study. In 2013, the
criteria were amended to recruit a limited number of older (age � 60
years) HIV� participants. There are no exclusions based on race, ethnic-
ity, language, immigration status, socioeconomic status, gender, sub-
stance use, or sexual preference. Most participants are recruited premor-
tem; however, the remains of very recently deceased individuals may be
donated by legal heirs, in which case information is obtained from guard-
ians and/or by authorized release of medical records. Extensive details
concerning NNAB guidelines, questionnaires and medical assessments
are available in reference 16.
ACSR. The AIDS and Cancer Specimen Resource (ACSR) is a Na-
tional Cancer Institute-funded program that supplies specimens from
HIV� participants with cancer to investigators interested in AIDS malig-
nancy research. For this study, the ACSR independently verified the tissue
diagnoses made by the NNAB and evaluated levels of HIV DNA. All of the
cases described here reside at both the ACSR and the NNAB. The use of
these materials is acknowledged to be a product of both NIH-funded
programs. This study has University of California at San Francisco IRB
approval (number 13-12020).
Patient cohort. For the present study, we selected a subset of five
participants from the NNAB studies with tissues available from the post-
mortem autopsy. These patients were chosen because they had substantial
cancer pathology at death and an undetectable (�40 HIV copies/mm of
fluid) VL at autopsy from the CSF and/or the blood (as measured from the
cardiac aspirate). Extensive medical histories were available and are de-
scribed in detail elsewhere (16). All tissues used in this study were histo-
logically examined by ACSR pathologists and classified based on the pa-
thology that was present in tissues extracted for the HIV DNA studies. For
a subset of analyses, we also included viral sequences from two additional
patients (designated KS1 and KS3), who died prior to the availability of
cART from advanced AIDS, including Kaposi’s sarcoma (KS). Similar to
the participants in the current study, KS1 and KS3 had multiple postmor-
tem tissues available through the ACSR. Fewer clinical details were avail-
able for the two KS patients, although we also had exact dates of death and
self-reported dates of infection. Details on all patients are reported in
Table 1.
RNA and DNA extraction. Tissues were chosen for sequence analysis
from the NNAB cohort participants if they were HIV DNA positive using
digital droplet PCR (ddPCR; details for ddPCR experiments are presented
in reference 16). An additional two tissues were included (lung from pa-
tient C02 and aorta from patient C05) that were ddPCR negative. KS1
tissues studied included skin tumor, lymph node tumor, lymph node, and
kidney. KS3 tissues included skin tumor, small bowel tumor, liver, and
stomach. All tissues from KS1 and KS3 were HIV�. Total RNA
and genomic DNA were isolated simultaneously from each tissue section
(30 to 50 ng) using the AllPrep DNA/RNA minikit (Qiagen; number
80204). Tissues were homogenized just prior to extraction in Buffer RLT
Plus (lysis buffer) using a TissueRupter rotor-stator homogenizer

number 990890) for each sample. Manufacturer’s guidelines were fol-
lowed, with the exception of two 50-�l final elutions using RNase-free
water during the RNA isolation. The 100-�l final volume of RNA gener-
ated was concentrated using an RNeasy MinElute Cleanup kit (Qiagen;
number 74204). RNA and DNA extractions, cDNA synthesis, and first-
round PCR setup were conducted in a restricted-access, amplicon-free
room with separate air handling and laboratory equipment where no am-
plified PCR products or recombinant cloned plasmids were allowed, and
work surfaces and equipment were thoroughly cleaned before and after
use with Eliminase (Decon Labs, Inc.). cDNA was synthesized using the
SuperScript III first-strand synthesis System (Invitrogen Life Technolo-
gies; number 18080-051) using the provided oligo(dT)20 primer accord-
ing to the manufacturer’s recommendations. RNA was incubated at 65°C
for 5 min with deoxynucleoside triphosphates (0.5 mM) and 5 �M oli-
go(dT)20 and then cooled quickly to 4°C. First-strand cDNA synthesis was
performed in a 40-�l reaction volume containing 1� reverse transcrip-
tion buffer (10 mM Tris-HCl [pH 8.4], 25 mM KCl), 5 mM MgCl2, 10
mM dithiothreitol, 2 U/�l of RNase-OUT (RNase inhibitor), and 10 U/�l
of SuperScript III reverse transcriptase (RT). The reaction was heated to
45°C for 90 min, followed by 85°C for 5 min. The reaction was cooled to
37°C, and 0.1 U/�l of Escherichia coli RNase H was added, followed by a
20-min incubation. cDNA was stored at �20°C.
Single-genome sequencing. A modified single-genome sequencing
protocol based on previously published methods was used to prevent PCR
resampling (17). cDNA and genomic DNA were serially diluted until an
average of 30% or less of the nested PCRs were positive. During the first-
round PCR, diluted cDNA or genomic DNA was amplified in 20-�l reac-
tion mixtures containing 1� Platinum Blue PCR SuperMix (Invitrogen

followed by 72°C for 10 min. This second-round PCR generates a 1.8-kb
product containing a complete envelope gp120 (env) sequence. Second-
round env PCR products were visualized on 1% agarose gels stained with
ethidium bromide, and reaction mixtures containing a single 1.8-kb
product were considered positive and selected for sequencing with BEF2
and BER2. Subsequently, the first-round reactions that corresponded to
positive second-round env PCRs were then used to amplify the nef gene
sequence; the second-round nef PCR mixture consisted of 2 �l of the first-

PCR products were visualized on 1% agarose gels stained with ethidium

considered positive and selected for sequencing with BNF1 and BNR2.
The primers were designed using Primer3 and observing regions of con-
servation in alignments of published HIV-1 subtype B sequences down-
loaded from the Los Alamos HIV Sequence Database (http://www.hiv.lanl

In order to examine tissue-based HIV for drug resistance mutations, a
1.3-kb fragment of genomic DNA encompassing HIV-1 protease and the
first 300 codons corresponding to RT (pol) was sequenced from DNA
isolated from each tissue using a limiting-dilution PCR modification of
previously described methods (18, 19). During the first-round PCR, di-
luted genomic DNA was amplified in 20-�l reaction mixtures containing
1� Platinum Blue PCR SuperMix (Invitrogen Life Technologies) and 0.2

of 94°C for 15 s, 55°C for 30 s, and 72°C for 2 min, followed by 72°C for 10
min. The second-round PCR mixture consisted of 2 �l of the first-round

s, 63°C for 30 s, and 72°C for 2 min, followed by 72°C for 10 min. Second-
round gp120 PCR products were visualized on 1% agarose gels stained
with ethidium bromide, and reactions yielding a single 1.3-kb product
were considered positive and selected for sequencing with PRO1 and
RT20.
Sequencing was performed on an Applied Biosystems 3730xl DNA
analyzer (Life Technologies) at the University of Florida Interdisciplinary
Center for Biotechnology Research (UF ICBR). All sequences were assem-
bled with the Geneious R7 software package (Biomatters; http://www
.geneious.com).
Sequence alignment. Sequences were aligned using ClustalW (20) in
MEGA5 (21), with further optimization performed by hand. The final env
and nef alignments spanned from positions 6213 to 7823 and positions
8797 to 9411 relative to the HXB2 genome, respectively. Due to a large
number of insertions and deletions that are typically problematic to align
and may bias phylogenetic analysis, hypervariable regions in env (V1, V2,
and V4 domains) were excluded. A preliminary maximum-likelihood
(ML) phylogeny for each gene was estimated using sequences from all
participants to ensure no cross-contamination of patient samples was
present. Sequences were tested for the presence of hypermutations using
the HYPERMUTE tool (http://www.lanl.gov); sequences with a P value
of �0.01 were removed from the alignments.
RNA and DNA population structure. Pairwise genetic distances
(PGD) were computed using the Tamura-Nei 93 (TN93) model of nucle-
otide substitution using a publically available script (https://github.com
/veg/tn93). We used the Fst statistic, which measures population subdivi-
sion, to determine whether the RNA and DNA populations were
significantly different in patients C02 and C05. One thousand bootstrap
replicates were used to assess significance of the Fst values. This analysis
was implemented in HYPHY (22).
Phylogenetic analysis. To determine relationships among sequences,
individual maximum-likelihood phylogenies for each patient were esti-
mated using PhyML (23) under a general time-reversible (GTR) nucleo-
tide substitution model and gamma distributed rate variation among sites
(��). Statistical support was assessed with 200 bootstrap replicates.
Bayesian time-scaled analysis. The Bayesian phylogenetic approach
implemented in BEAST v.1.8.2 (24) was used to generate rooted, time-
measured phylogenies for three ART-treated patients (C02, C04, and
C05). To compare evolutionary patterns among cART-treated and cART-
naive cancer patients, we also undertook Bayesian phylogenetic analyses
on tissue virus from two additional ART-naive cancer patients (KS1 and
KS3). A relaxed molecular clock model was used with a log- normal model
of among-branch rate variation. For each patient a normally distributed
prior distribution was placed on the root height parameter; the mean of
this distribution was set to the reported date of infection (Table 1) with a
standard deviation of 0.5. For Bayesian phylogenetic analyses we used the
Hasegawa-Kishino-Yano (HKY) model of nucleotide substitution with
Rose et al.

 gamma distributed among site rate variation (��). Separate substitution
models were specified for 1 plus 2 codon positions versus 3rd codon
positions. The Bayesian skygrid coalescent prior was used (99 categories).
Analyses were run for 100 million steps or until chain convergence, as
assessed using Tracer (ESS values of �200). In some cases, the results from
multiple analyses were combined. The maximum clade credibility (MCC)
tree was reconstructed from the posterior distribution, minus a 10%
burn-in. Each MCC tree was visualized and annotated in FigTree v.1.4.2
(programs available at http://tree.bio.ed.ac.uk/software/).
RNAscope and IHC. We used an in situ hybridization technique
(RNAscope) developed by Advanced Cell Diagnostics (ACD) to identify
tissue-based cells expressing HIV gag-pol mRNA transcripts. This tech-
nology uses a “double Z” probe design, which greatly increases signal-to-
noise ratio with visualization of single mRNA transcripts. RNAscope was
performed using the 2.0 HD reagent kit-RED kit (ACD; catalog number
310036) according to the manufacturer’s instructions. HIV mRNA was
detected using an HIV gag-pol probe (ACD; catalog number 317691). The
RNAscope assay was followed by standard immunohistochemistry (IHC)
for macrophage markers using mouse monoclonal antibody (MAb) to
CD163 (Novocastra) and CD68 (Dako) (both brown), CD68 and CD163
nuclei were counterstained with hematoxylin QS (Vector Laboratories;
catalog number H-3404). Tissue sections were analyzed with a Leica
DM6000 B microscope equipped with a Leica DFC 500 camera and LAS
v4.3 software.
Accession number(s). Sequences have been submitted to GenBank
(accession numbers KU708874 to KU709831).
RESULTS
HIV RNA and DNA sequences were obtained from tissues for
four of the five participants. Total DNA and RNA was extracted
from each ddPCR� tissue for five participants and subjected to
first-round single-genome amplification of the HIV env-nef do-
mains, followed by second-round amplification of separate env
and nef gene sequences. HIV pol DNA was amplified from a subset
of these tissues to examine sequence data for drug resistance mu-
tations. Sequences were generated from 54% of the ddPCR HIV�
tissues (n � 19) and at least one tissue for four of the five patients
(Table 2).
RNA and DNA sequences arose from same population. For
participants C02 and C05, we used the Fst statistic to test whether
sequences obtained from RNA and DNA represented genetically
distinct subpopulations. No significant differences were found in
either participant for either env or nef (Fst � �0.012 and P �
0.894 for C02; Fst � 0.020 and P � 0.23 for C05). Therefore, DNA
and RNA sequences from each tissue were grouped together for
the remainder of analyses. We did not apply this test between
tissues, as in some cases too few sequences were present for mean-
ingful analysis.
env and nef from both cART� and cART� patients showed
similar levels of diversity. For each patient, we then calculated
PGD among all env and nef sequences (Fig. 1). For the env gene,
patients C02, C04, and C05 exhibited lower mean PGD than the
two cART-naive patients, although the interquartile range (IQR)
for C02 and C05 overlapped those for KS1 and KS3, while the IQR
for C04 was less than for both KS patients. However, for the nef
gene, the mean PGD for C05 was similar to that of KS1 and KS3,
and the IQR for all participants overlapped.
Anatomically dispersed viral populations evolve via differ-
ent modes of evolution. In the env gene phylogeny of patient C02
(Fig. 2, left), many brain-derived sequences cluster in three dis-
tinct clades (A to C), each of which has a very recent common
ancestor, and most of the remaining sequences from brain, lymph
node tumor, and lung have only a few or no closely related se-
quences and therefore descend from long terminal branches. The
majority of DNA and RNA sequences in clades A to C are identi-
cal. This pattern is consistent with a sudden and recent expansion
of a population of viruses that has been genetically distinct from
the remainder. However, note that these clades are not exclusively
comprised of virus from the brain, as three lymph node tumor
sequences are among them, and both RNA and DNA sequences
are present. A few lymph node tumor-derived sequences are pres-
ent in clades A and B, with a potential migration event(s) between
lymph node tumor and brain. The nef gene showed a similar pat-
tern (Fig. 2, right). This patient was reportedly on cART through-
out infection, although clinical records indicate that adherence
may have been suboptimal. However, the patient was in a man-
aged-care facility, where medication was administered by staff,
before death. The patient’s last VL measurement at death was
undetectable and no virus was detected at autopsy in either plasma
or CSF. His only cancer diagnosis occurred at autopsy, when plas-
macytoma was diagnosed in multiple tissues, along with menin-

 geal infiltrate into the brain. The lack of detection of this cancer
while alive suggests a late onset and rapid spread. We did not apply
a test for significance of population structure among tissues, as
clearly there are multiple patterns of gene evolution within the
tree, which would be masked by a simple statistic.
In the env phylogeny of patient C04, there were two well-sup-
ported clades, one containing only lung sequences (E) and the
other containing lung and colon sequences (F) (Fig. 3). Note that
the scale of substitution for env is much different from that for C02
and reflects the relatively low diversity within this patient (Fig. 3,
left). The nef gene showed more variation and longer branches,
and the lung-exclusive clade is now within the rest of the tree and
contains a kidney sequence that is identical to the lung sequence
(Fig. 3, right). Additionally, clade G contained identical sequences
from lung and colon, suggesting minimal barriers to gene flow
among tissues. This patient, who was receiving fully suppressive
cART since being diagnosed with HIV infection, also experienced
treated yet unresolved lymphoma until death. No RNA sequences
were obtained for this patient, suggesting that proviruses were not
being expressed at the time of death (or the RNA recovered from
the autopsy tissue was degraded).
The patient C05 env phylogeny (Fig. 4, left) shows a pattern
similar to that in patient C02, in which some clades (e.g., H) con-
tain identical RNA and DNA sequences from, in this case, the
spleen (H), or spleen and tumor lymph node (I), while other
clades contain virus from multiple tissues that appears to be accu-
mulating mutations (J). A clade with a very long branch (K) is in
both trees and contains DNA sequences from kidney and pancreas,
which suggests a potential compartmentalization and lack of replica-
tion, although in nef one spleen sequence is closely related and other
kidney sequences are found scattered in the nef tree. The clades of
identicalsequencespresentinenvdidnothaveanefcounterpart,and
thus, those clades disappear in the nef tree. This patient received a
lymphoma diagnosis around 2 years before death. Late in life, this
patient’s cancer spread to the liver, leading to death.
Evolutionary rates in env and nef are similar in ART-infected
and ART-naive viral populations. We then estimated rates of
HIV sequence evolution for these three patients using a Bayesian
analysis in which a strong prior was placed on the root of the tree,

formed the same analysis using two additional patients, who died
with KS prior to the era of cART. These patients also had known
dates of death and HIV diagnosis. These results are shown in Fig.
5. For comparison, we included on the graph viral evolutionary
rates obtained from an earlier study (8) that analyzed HIV gag
gene evolution between pretherapy and during suppressive ther-
apy. Finally, we included the within-host evolutionary rates re-
ported in references 25 and 26.
The evolutionary rates for both env and nef in patients KS1 and
KS3 were similar. Estimated env gene rates for patients C02 and
C05 were not significantly different from the env rates for KS1

 and KS3. C04 did exhibit a significantly lower rate than the other
patients; however, this rate was still �1 � 10�3. All three cART-
treated patients had higher mean rates for nef than the cART-naive
patients, although the distributions overlapped for all patients
(Fig. 5). These rates are all similar to those reported in two previ-
ous studies (shown in the figure). However, these results are in
stark contrast to those found by Josefsson et al. (8), who reported
that the HIV evolutionary rate was reduced by orders of magni-
tude when HIV in T cells during suppressive cART was compared
to plasma-derived virus sampled pre-cART. The rates estimated
from our patients are similar to that estimated from one ART-
naive patient using a similar approach (27).
In addition, in our study, we found that among-branch rate
variation was extremely high in nearly all patients and genes (Ta-
ble 3), consistent with the patients harboring viruses that evolve at
different speeds. We note that while the viral population sampled
at death may have a more recent temporal origin than the date of
HIV diagnoses, the evolutionary rates would then be expected to
increase, since the same amount of variation would need to have
arisen in a shorter period. Although the date of HIV diagnosis may
have been later than the true date of HIV infection, the precise
clinical records of these patients indicates major health complica-
tions at the time of diagnosis, suggesting frequent health care and
opportunities for testing.
Wild-type viruses evolve in tissues in cART-treated patients.
We sequenced the pol gene from a subset of the tissues for each of
the three patients to determine whether the viral populations in
tissues were wild-type virus, and therefore shielded from the ef-
fects of cART, or whether they were drug resistant, which would
suggest some mechanism by which viruses replicated in tissues but
not in blood T cells. Only one sequence (in participant C05) out of
a total 88 pol sequences analyzed carried a drug resistance muta-
tion (against nonnucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitors
[NNRTIs]). This patient was on nevirapine early in his treatment
but was quickly switched to non-NNRTIs.
HIV RNA gag-pol transcripts are present in cellular clusters
in cerebellum and singularly in lymph node tumor. Images from
the RNAscope analysis showed that HIV mRNA transcripts for
gag-pol were present within cells and in extracellular space in both
the lymph node tumor and cerebellum in patient C02, the same
tissues in which both viral DNA and RNA sequences were also
recovered (Fig. 6). In the lymph node tumor, HIV-expressing cells
were typically localized distinct from each other (Fig. 6a and b). In
contrast, HIV-expressing cells were found in “clusters” in the cer-
ebellum and appeared to be expressing high levels of viral tran-
scripts (Fig. 6c and d). In both tissues, HIV-expressing cells were
surrounded by cells that costained for CD68/CD163, indicative of
infiltrating activated macrophages. Furthermore, some of these
macrophages appeared to be associated with HIV RNA in the
brain (Fig. 6e and f). These results are consistent with the phylo-
genetic patterns, in which viral variants were dispersed among
tissues and a rapid expansion of identical DNA and RNA se-
quences was evident in the cerebellum.
DISCUSSION
A striking result from this study was the lack of a substantial re-
duction in HIV evolutionary rates in anatomical tissues collected

 from fully suppressed cART-treated patients compared to viral
populations in cART-naive patients. Several studies that have
sampled T cells or plasma after therapy interruption have found a
genetically homogeneous HIV population that was similar, if not
identical, to the pretherapy virus (10, 11). One study, which esti-
mated the evolutionary rate of post-ART T cells compared with
pre-cART plasma virus using a method similar to that described
here, found that the evolutionary rate was reduced orders of mag-
nitude in post-cART virus, suggesting little to no virus replication
or evolution in the T-cell population (8). Distinct subsets of T cells
are known to act as cellular reservoirs of HIV during cART (1–7),
and the maintenance of nonevolving viral populations has been
shown to occur through cellular expansion of memory cells with
integrated but nonexpressing provirus (28, 29). Therefore, an al-
ternative site of viral maintenance during cART, apart from mem-
ory T cells, must be present in order to explain the results pre-
sented here.
It is possible that lymphatic tissues, including lymph node and
spleen, may be conducive to viral replication during cART. A re-
cent study used the same analytical method as the one in this study
to estimate evolutionary history and found evidence of ongoing
replication of wild-type virus in lymph nodes and continual seed-
ing of the blood from lymph node sanctuary sites where drugs are
not fully suppressive (9). Another group reported evidence for
HIV RNA� cells in lymph nodes prior to therapy interruption and
a diverse population of rebound virus, suggesting that the re-
bounding viral population originated from multiple sources, in-
cluding lymph nodes (8). Lower concentrations of drugs are also
found in lymphatic tissues (30). Our finding of ongoing replica-
tion of HIV RNA and DNA in lymph node and spleen is consistent
with these observations. The lymph system may serve as an alter-
native route for HIV-infected cells to migrate (31), which would
explain our observation of the dispersal of viral population among
tissues (i.e., no compartmentalization), as well the lack of detect-
able virus in the blood. Furthermore, a recent study suggested that
the meninges may be part of the lymphatic system (32), which
could provide an explanation of late infection in the brain noted
previously (33) and shown in this study in the recent and rapid
expansion in the cerebellum. We note that our intention in this
study was not to determine routes of migration among tissues or
the extent of compartmentalization among tissues, as the num-
bers of sequences among sites were unequal. In addition, clearly
there were several types of evolution occurring among these se-
quences, which could result from infection of different cell types
with various dynamics.
For example, in addition to T cells, tissue-resident macro-
phages are long-lived cells capable of harboring virus (34, 35).
Macrophages are less resistant to the cytopathic effects of the virus
(36), contain lower intracellular concentrations of cART (37–39),
and participate in efficient cell-to-cell transfer of virus among
macrophages and from macrophages to T cells (40), thus under-
mining the effectiveness of cART (41). We did not test the identity
of the cells from which virus was extracted; however, we found
evidence of activated infiltrating macrophages in very close prox-
imity to HIV-expressing cells in two tissues, and potential HIV
expression by these macrophages in the brain. Infection of multi-
ple cell types, i.e., T cells and macrophages, may provide explana-
tions for the two distinct branching patterns found in all patients
in this study, consistent with ongoing evolution in long-lived cells
and clonal expansion.
All of the participants in this study, as well as the two cART-
naive participants, were diagnosed with at least one type of cancer.
In a previous study, we found that tumors harbored viral strains
that were distinct from those in nontumor tissues and that mac-
rophages were identified as productively infected cells in the tu-
mors (15). Tumor-associated macrophages may contribute to on-
going HIV replication by orchestrating tumor progression,
angiogenesis, tumor growth, and metastasis (42–45) and migra-
tion of cells (46). The presence of activated infiltrating macro-
phages surrounding HIV-expressing cells in the two tissues stud-
ied in this work is consistent with recent migration of these cells,
and potentially of the HIV-infected cells as well. If these cells were
derived from the tumor as a result of metastasis, this again would
explain the ability of the virus to replicate despite cART, dispersal
of virus among tissues, and evidence of rapid and recent expan-
sion of a replicating viral population. Furthermore, cancers can
induce type I IFN production, which may play a role in anti-tumor
immunity (47), drive T cell dysfunction (48), and contribute to
other aspects of HIV disease pathogenesis, for example, virus con-
trol (MX2 postentry inhibition [49], APOBEC3 restriction of rep-
lication [50], BST-2 virus release [51], and NK cell activation [52])
or immune activation or dysfunction (CD38 expression on CD8�
T cells [53], CD4� T cell/Fas-dependent apoptosis [54], or de-

 creased interleukin 7 [IL-7]/increased activation-induced T cell
proliferation [55]). These beneficial or deleterious effects may or
may not relate to the evolution and dispersion of virus popula-
tions among tissues during the onset of cancer.
There are, of course, limitations to this study. In particular, the
individuals selected do not represent a random or representative
sample of all HIV-infected persons, as the NNAB preferentially
selects participants thought to have serious life-threatening ill-
nesses. Furthermore, one selection criterion for inclusion was a
short postmortem interval, which could exclude healthier partic-
ipants who expire at some distance from the study site, while pref-
erentially including participants who expire due to poor health in
a medical facility. Although the medical information reported
here is complete to the best of our ability, some clinical variables
are unknown. The precise location of tissue sampling could clearly
impact HIV recovery; for example, Lamers et al. (16) found high
variability in the amount and detection of HIV in tissues could
within an individual. We used a sequencing technique (single-
genome sequencing) and multiple extractions and amplifications
in order to ensure that we sampled the broadest variability possi-
ble, but deep-sequencing studies could provide even more resolu-
tion. Additional studies including more patients are clearly re-
quired to completely understand the trajectory of viral evolution
during cART.
