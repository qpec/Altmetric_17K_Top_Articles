Abstract
Pediatric solid tumors arise from endodermal, ectodermal, or mesodermal lineages1. Although the 
overall survival of children with solid tumors is 75%, that of children with recurrent disease is 
below 30%2. To capture the complexity and diversity of pediatric solid tumors and establish new 
models of recurrent disease, we developed a protocol to produce orthotopic patient-derived 
xenografts (O-PDXs) at diagnosis, recurrence, and autopsy. Tumor specimens were received from 
168 patients, and 67 O-PDXs were established for 12 types of cancer. The origins of the O-PDX 
tumors were reflected in their gene-expression profiles and epigenomes. Genomic profiling of the 
tumors, including detailed clonal analysis, was performed to determine whether the clonal 
population in the xenograft recapitulated the patient’s tumor. We identified several drug 
vulnerabilities and showed that the combination of a WEE1 inhibitor (AZD1775), irinotecan, and 
vincristine can lead to complete response in multiple rhabdomyosarcoma O-PDX tumors in vivo.
One barrier to identifying and validating biomarkers that predict sensitivity to molecularly 
targeted therapeutics is the lack of preclinical models that capture the diversity of pediatric 
solid tumors. For adult cancers, several important advances have been achieved in 
developing patient-derived organoids for colon, prostate, and pancreatic cancer3–5, and this 
has led to an international collaboration called the Human Cancer Model Initiative for 
developing cancer and normal organoids for the research community. There are also 
international efforts to develop patient-derived xenografts (PDXs) for adult leukemias and 
solid tumors, including the EuroPDX consortium, the Public Repository of Xenografts, and 
the NCI Patient-Derived Models Repository6–9. Pediatric solid tumors are rare, relative to 
adult cancers, and access to tissue is a barrier to developing pediatric organoids or PDX 
models of solid tumors10.
To obtain fresh tumor tissue from children with solid tumors, we developed a protocol 
(NCT01050296) called Molecular Analysis of Solid Tumors (MAST). Between 2010 and 
2015, 225 patients consented to the protocol and we received 192 tumor specimens from 168 
patients. Of the 192 specimens, 148 (77%) were injected into immunocompromised mice 
(Supplementary Table 1, Fig. 1a)11. Once the individual O-PDXs grow in the mice, they are 
expanded for banking and undergo molecular, cellular, and histologic characterization 
concurrently with the patient tumor.
In total, we injected 15 different types of pediatric solid tumors, including 41 
neuroblastomas, 31 osteosarcomas, 20 rhabdomyosarcomas, 10 retinoblastomas, 9 Wilms 
tumors, 9 desmoplastic small round-cell tumors, 7 Ewing sarcomas, 6 high-grade sarcomas,

 and 5 adrenocortical carcinomas (Fig. 1b and Supplementary Table 1). Additionally, 10 
tumor specimens representing 6 rare tumor types were injected. We have successfully 
established 67 O-PDXs from 12 different pediatric solid tumor types (Fig. 1b).
The overall engraftment efficiency was 45% (67/148) (Supplementary Table 1). The highest 
rates of engraftment were for high-grade sarcoma (83%), Wilms tumor (78%), 
retinoblastoma (70%), and rhabdomyosarcoma (65%) (Fig. 1b). Recurrent tumor samples 
were significantly more likely to engraft (63%) than were diagnostic samples (37%) 
(p=0.012; Fig. 1c). There was a similar engraftment rate for samples from metastatic (53%) 
and primary (43%) sites (Fig. 1d). The engraftment efficiency of samples obtained prior to 
chemotherapy was similar (50%) to that of samples obtained during chemotherapy (41%) 
(Fig. 1e).
We performed hematoxylin and eosin staining and immunohistochemistry on 51 O-PDX/
patient tumor pairs (Extended Data Fig. 1a–d, Supplementary Table 2). 49 of the tumors 
were evaluable for immunostaining, and 98% (48/49) were concordant between the O-PDX 
and the patient tumor. We scored the proportion of proliferating cells as measured by Ki67 
immunostaining and dying cells as measured by activated caspase 3 immunostaining. We 
also performed tumor type—specific protein immunohistochemical staining (Supplementary 
Table 2). Neuroblastomas were stained for synaptophysin (Extended Data Fig. 1e), 
rhabdomyosarcomas for myogenin and MyoD1, osteosarcomas for SATB2, Ewing sarcomas 
for FLI-1, high-grade sarcomas for vimentin, liposarcomas for S100, retinoblastomas for 
CRX, and rhabdoid tumors for INI1. In total, 1,173 slides were examined and evaluated 
microscopically. Generally, there was more proliferation (Ki67+) and less cell death 
(activated caspase 3+) in the O-PDXs than in the patient tumors. Each of the tumor type–
specific immunohistochemical stains were concordant between the patient tumors and the O-
PDXs, except for SJRHB010928_X1, which was discordant by histopathologic analysis.
Next, we surveyed 36 of the O-PDX tumors by transmission electron microscopy (TEM) to 
characterize subcellular features of each tumor type (Supplementary Table 2). 
Rhabdomyosarcomas had intracellular myofibrils; neuroblastomas had dense core vesicles; 
liposarcomas had large lipid droplets, and osteosarcomas had swollen endoplasmic 
reticulum and collagen deposits (Extended Data Fig. 1f–i). Overall, the O-PDX tumors 
retained the cellular and subcellular features of the patient tumors (Supplementary Table 2).
To determine whether the O-PDX tumors retain the somatic mutations in the patient tumors 
and whether they acquire additional mutations, we performed whole-genome sequencing 
(WGS) and whole-exome sequencing (WES) of the O-PDXs and the matched patient tumor 
and germline samples (51 O-PDX/tumor pairs). For some samples, mutations were detected 
in the O-PDX but not the patient tumor and vice versa (Extended Data Fig. 2 and 
Supplementary Table 3). These differences in detection of mutations may be due to patient 
tumor purity, clonal changes, or sequence coverage. To distinguish amongst these 
possibilities, we performed capture enrichment and Illumina sequencing for 32,113 single 
nucleotide variations (SNVs) identified across the sample cohort. The 2 mutations that were 
lost in the O-PDXs showed that both were due to shifts in the clonal composition. Among 
the 14 mutations that were gained in the O-PDXs, 6 were not surveyed due to copy number

 alterations (CNAs), 2 were due to low tumor purity, 1 was due to insufficient coverage in the 
patient tumor, and the remaining 5 were bona fide new SNVs acquired in the O-PDX. 
Together, these data suggest that the O-PDXs faithfully maintain many features of the 
genomic landscape of the patient tumor from which they were derived.
To determine whether the clonal composition of O-PDX tumors changes relative to the 
patient tumors, we performed clonal analysis using the deep-sequence reads for all the SNVs 
across 42 of the patient tumors and their matched O-PDXs (Supplementary Table 4). In total, 
24% (10/42) of the O-PDXs faithfully preserved the clonal composition of the patient tumor 
(Group 1, Fig. 2a). Thirty-one percent (13/42) maintained the major clonal features of the 
patient tumor in the O-PDX but continued to clonally evolve in the mice (Group 2, Fig. 2b). 
Some O-PDX tumors (33%; 14/42) were derived from the major clone in the patient tumor 
but showed evidence of clonal loss (Group 3, Fig. 2c), and 12% (5/42) of the O-PDX tumors 
had clonal loss and were derived from a minor clone (<10% of patient tumor) (Group 4, Fig. 
2d). Osteosarcomas had the best clonal preservation and neuroblastomas had the least (Fig. 
2e).
To determine if the clonal composition of O-PDX tumors was stable with passages in vivo, 
we performed clonal analysis on 18 early-passage (initial engraftment or passage 1) and late-
passage (passages 4–6) O-PDX tumor pairs (Supplementary Table 4). Forty-four percent 
(8/18) of the O-PDX tumors had clonal preservation (Group 1) at late passage relative to 
early passage (Fig. 2f), and a similar number (7/18) maintained the major clonal features of 
the early-passage tumor but continued to evolve (Group 2).
We also analyzed the different O-PDX sublines and regional clonal heterogeneity in the 
tumor mass. The patient tumors were initially implanted in up to 10 immunocompromised 
mice, and each tumor that grew was designated as a separate subline. For this analysis, we 
selected 11 O-PDX tumors with multiple sublines (range, 2–5 sublines per tumor) and 
performed clonal analysis (Supplementary Table 4). All tumors were from initial 
engraftment or the first passage. Sixty-four percent (7/11) of the O-PDX models had clonal 
preservation across 2 sublines (Group 1, Fig. 2g), and the remaining 4 had features of the 
major clone but showed some clonal evolution (Group 2). To test the regional heterogeneity 
within tumors, we selected 6 O-PDX tumors and sampled 8 regions of the tumor using a 
biopsy punch (Fig. 2h,i). Clonal analysis of those samples showed clonal preservation 
(Group 1, Fig. 2j, and Supplementary Table 4).
To compare the gene-expression profiles of patient tumors to those of their matched O-
PDXs, we performed RNA sequencing (RNA-seq) on all 102 samples that were analyzed by 
WGS and WES. We calculated the correlation coefficient from the Log2 transformed FPKM 
value for each pair and grouped the data by tumor type (Extended Data Fig. 3a and 
Supplementary Table 5). There was no difference in the O-PDX/patient tumor correlation 
coefficients for the RNA-seq data by tumor type (p = 0.62, Kruskal-Wallis test). However, 
there was a significant inverse correlation between the patient tumor purity calculated from 
the WGS data and the O-PDX/patient tumor RNA-seq correlation coefficients for 
neuroblastoma and rhabdomyosarcoma (Extended Data Fig. 3b–d). Patient tumors with low 
tumor purity contained more infiltrating normal cells than did those with higher tumor

 purity. Upon transplantation into immunocompromised mice, the normal cells were lost, 
which can lead to a lower correlation for the RNA-seq of the patient tumor and matched O-
PDX sample (Extended Data Fig. 3).
To determine whether the developmental origins are preserved in the tumors, we identified 
the genes that were significantly upregulated in neuroblastoma, osteosarcoma and 
rhabdomyosarcoma (Supplementary Table 5). The most significantly enriched pathways in 
neuroblastoma were those for neuronal development and homeostasis, rhabdomyosarcomas 
were enriched for myogenesis and osteosarcomas were enriched for pathways in bone 
development and collagen production. To determine whether this association is reflected in 
the epigenetic landscape of the tumors, we performed chromatin immunoprecipitation 
sequencing (ChIP-seq) for 9 histone marks (H3K27Ac, H3K27me3, H3K36me3, H3K4me1, 
H3K4me2, H3K4me3, H3K9-14Ac, H3K9me2, H3K9me3), RNA Pol II, CTCF, and BRD4. 
We used chromatin prepared from a representative embryonal rhabdomyosarcoma (ERMS, 
SJRHB000026_X1), an alveolar rhabdomyosarcoma (ARMS, SJRHB010463_X16), an 
osteosarcoma (SJOS001112_X1), and a neuroblastoma (SJNBL046_X). We performed 
ChIP-seq from biological replicates of each sample for a total of 96 ChIP-seq libraries. We 
performed chromatin Hidden Markov Modeling (chromo-HMM)12 using 16 states (Fig. 
3a,b). States 1–6 had epigenetic marks consistent with enhancers and active promoters; state 
7 contained epigenetic marks of bivalent (H3K27me3/H3K27Ac) poised promoters/
enhancers; and states 8–10 included epigenetic marks of gene bodies. State 11 comprised 
polycomb-repressed genomic regions, and state 12 was an empty state lacking ChIP-seq 
peaks in our analysis. States 13 and 14 consisted of heterochromatin, and state 15 
represented repressed chromatin (H3K27me3 and H3K9me3). The CTCF insulator protein–
bound regions were enriched in state 16.
Most lineage-specific genes that were expressed at high levels in a particular tumor type had 
tumor-specific enrichment in active chromo-HMM states (states 1–6) (Fig. 3c and Extended 
Data Fig. 4). The chromo-HMM state for those genes in the tumor types where they are not 
expressed were often classified as empty (chromo-HMM state 12) or H3K27me3-repressed 
(chromo-HMM states 7, 11, 15) (Fig. 3c and Extended Data Fig. 4). For example, the SP7 
gene was expressed in osteosarcoma but not in neuroblastoma or rhabdomyosarcoma (Fig. 
3d). The promoter of the SP7 gene has an HMM state of a strong active promoter (state 1) in 
osteosarcoma, but it is silent in rhabdomyosarcoma (Fig. 3d,e). Similar patterns were found 
for genes expressed specifically in rhabdomyosarcoma and neuroblastoma (Extended Data 
Fig. 4). Together, these data suggest that the lineage-specific developmental program is 
strongly preserved in the epigenome of pediatric solid tumors (Supplementary Table 5).
To determine whether our O-PDX tumors demonstrate differential drug sensitivity, we 
developed primary culture conditions for each tumor type for high throughput drug 
screening. We screened 16 rhabdomyosarcomas, 8 osteosarcomas, 4 neuroblastomas, 1 
Ewing sarcoma, and 1 rhabdoid tumor. For comparison, we also included 21 pediatric solid 
tumor cell lines (Supplementary Table 6); 156 drugs were used in this analysis for a total of 
over 500,000 individual data points. Of the 1,960 plates screened, 49 (2.5%) had z-prime < 0 
and were excluded from further analysis. Of the remaining plates, the average z-prime was 
0.57, and 95% of all plates has z-prime between 0.27 and 0.82 (Extended Data Fig. 5a).

 Drugs with the same mechanism of action had similar activity across O-PDXs and cell lines 
(Extended Data Fig. 5b). Mutations in signal transduction pathways were predictive of 
tumor response in a subset of tumors (Extended data Fig. 5c). Validated data were entered 
into a central database (https://stjude.org/cstn-drug-sensitivity), and curve-fitting was 
performed to determine the EC50 of each drug for each tumor (Supplementary Table 6). 
Growth rate can influence drug sensitivity for some classes of drugs in high-throughput 
screening experiments13 so we corrected for differences in growth rate (Supplementary 
Table 6). The most commonly used broad-spectrum chemotherapeutics were active across 
several tumor types and histone deacetylase (HDAC) and proteasome inhibitors were 
particularly active across tumor types (Supplementary Table 6 and https://stjude.org/cstn-
drug-sensitivity).
Among the drugs with tumor subtype–specific activity, the WEE1 inhibitor AZD1775 
(MK-1775) was of particular interest for rhabdomyosarcoma because a phase I study of 
AZD1775 with irinotecan (IRN) was recently completed by the Children’s Oncology Group 
(COG trial: NCT02095132). This is important because IRN and vincristine (VCR) are used 
to treat recurrent rhabdomyosarcoma, and given the sensitivity of rhabdomyosarcoma O-
PDXs to AZD1775, combining it with IRN and VCR may be justified for future clinical 
trials. Indeed, most of the rhabdomyosarcoma O-PDX tumors were sensitive to AZD1775, 
whether they were obtained at diagnosis or recurrence (Supplementary Table 6).
To establish a clinically relevant murine-equivalent dose for bortezomib (proteasome 
inhibitor), panobinostat (HDAC inhibitor), and AZD1775 (WEE1 inhibitor), we performed 
plasma and tumor pharmacokinetic studies of SJRHB000026_X1 tumor-bearing mice 
(Extended Data Fig. 6a–c and Supplementary Information). Preclinical phase I studies were 
performed on athymic nontumor-bearing mice to establish the tolerability of the drug 
combination at clinically relevant doses and schedules14,15. We used O-PDXs derived from 
2 high-risk ERMS tumors that were resected at recurrence (SJRHB000026_X1 and 
SJRHB012_Y) and a high-risk ARMS tumor resected at recurrence (SJRHB013759_X1) 
(Supplementary Table 1). We introduced a luciferase reporter gene into the O-PDXs, 
orthotopically injected the tumor cells into immunocompromised mice and several weeks 
later, the mice were enrolled in a preclinical phase II trial as described previously14,15. Mice 
were screened weekly using bioluminescence, and 4–6 courses (21 days per course) of 
therapy were administered (Extended Data Fig. 6d). Mice with a tumor burden greater than 
20% of their body weight were removed from the study and scored as progressive disease 
(PD). Stable disease (SD), partial responses (PR), and complete responses (CR) were scored 
as done previously14,15. All of the mice treated with panobinostat and bortezomib had PD 
for all 3 O-PDX tumors tested (Fig. 4a,b, Extended Data Fig. 6e and Supplementary Table 
7). The mice treated with AZD1775+VCR+IRN had a better response than those treated 
with VCR+IRN alone (Extended Data Fig. 6f–h and Supplementary Table 7).
Based on the activity of AZD1775 combined with VCR and IRN in multiple O-PDX 
rhabdomyosarcoma models, we performed a double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled 
preclinical phase III study, as described previously14,15. We used the same O-PDX models 
as above (SJRHB000026_X1, SJRHB012_Y, SJRHB013759_X1) and added another ARMS 
O-PDX (SJRHB013757_X2) (Supplementary Table 1). We enrolled 140 mice and

 randomized them to 4 treatment groups (placebo, AZD1775, VCR+IRN, and 
AZD1775+VCR+IRN; Supplementary Table 8). Each of the O-PDX tumors had an 
improved outcome with the triple-drug combination relative to the standard of care (VCR
+IRN), AZD1775 alone, or placebo (Fig. 4c–f). Individual O-PDX tumors showed marked 
differences in response to VCR+IRN and AZD1775+VCR+IRN, highlighting the 
importance of using multiple O-PDX models for preclinical studies (Figure 4e,f and 
Supplementary Table 8). In addition, we performed clonal analysis on 17 O-PDX tumors 
from SJRHB000026_X1 mice with PD in 3 different treatment groups (AZD1775, VCR
+IRN, and AZD1775+VCR+IRN). Fifty-nine percent (10/17) of those tumors showed clonal 
selection for the minor clone (Supplementary Table 4), which was similar to results from 
previously published data on patient tumors before and after treatment16.
Many of the O-PDXs that we developed are from patients with recurrent disease, which is 
important because there were previously few models of recurrent pediatric solid tumors. The 
O-PDXs retained the molecular and cellular features of the patient tumor and the epigenetic 
landscape of their developmental origins. The clonal composition of the patient tumors was 
compared to the O-PDX tumors at early and late passages, from different sublines and 
distinct locations within the tumor mass. Some O-PDX tumors retained the clonal 
composition of the patient tumor even after several passages in mice but others underwent 
clonal changes. For some tumors, different sublines captured different clones from the 
patient tumor suggesting that separately propagating individual sublines may be important 
for capturing the clonal heterogeneity in patient tumors. The drug screening identified 
chemotherapeutic agents that had broad activity as well as drugs that were more selective for 
particular cancer types. This approach led to the discovery that the combination of a WEE1 
inhibitor with IRN and VCR can improve response across 4 different O-PDXs of high-risk 
rhabdomyosarcoma, including recurrent disease, relative to IRN and VCR alone. We 
demonstrated clonal selection in the treated tumors, as shown previously in patients16 and it 
will be important to directly relate the clonal selection in O-PDX models to patients in future 
studies. This is proof of principle for using O-PDX tumors for basic and translational 
research on pediatric solid tumors and it provides a useful platform for understanding clonal 
selection in recurrent disease. All of our O-PDX models and associated data are freely 
shared through the Childhood Solid Tumor Network (CSTN; www.stjude.org/CSTN/) with 
no obligation to collaborate.
METHODS
Animals
Athymic nude immunodeficient mice were purchased from Jackson Laboratories (strain 
code 007850). NSG mice were purchased from Jackson Laboratories (strain code 005557). 
C57BL/6 scid mice were purchased from Jackson Laboratories (strain code 001913). This 
study was carried out in strict accordance with the recommendations in the Guide to Care 
and Use of Laboratory Animals of the National Institute of Health. The protocol was 
approved by the Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee at St. Jude Children’s 
Research Hospital. All efforts were made to minimize suffering. All mice were housed in

 accordance with approved IACUC protocols. Animals were housed on a 12–12 light cycle 
(light on 6am off 6pm) and provided food and water ad libitum.
Patient Consent and MAST Protocol
Excess, deidentified tumor material was collected from solid tumor patients at St. Jude 
Children’s Research Hospital in agreement with local institutional ethical regulations and 
institutional review board approval. Patient consent for tissue acquisition was obtained under 
the guidelines of the MAST protocol.
Primary Patient Tissue Processing
Primary tumor tissue was processed for implantation within 2 hours of surgical resection in 
the majority of cases. Primary tumor was enzymatically dissociated into a single cell 
suspension and injected into an anatomically correct location for the disease type when 
possible. If the initial tumor sample was too small for dissociation, tumor tissue was 
implanted in the flank location. Initial implantation was primarily done into recipient NSG 
female mice with the exception of retinoblastoma which was implanted into C57BL/6 scid 
mice. After engraftment and sufficient tumor growth, the tumor was harvested and passaged 
into athymic nude mice using the same dissociation and implantation techniques.
Orthotopic Injections
(Bone Marrow Injections) To minimize distress and movement during the procedure, 
isoflurane gas anesthetic is used. The mouse is placed in the supine position on a nose cone 
prior to injection. The skin of the knee joint is prepped with alternating iodine scrubs and 
70% isopropyl alcohol wipes. The prepped leg is flexed at the knee joint and secured to the 
work surface. The femur is palpated until the femoral condyles become visible. A 25-gauge 
needle on a 50 μL Hamilton glass syringe (Hamilton Cat# 80920) is held at a 45-degree 
angle to the mouse, and the needle tip is inserted into the femur via the femoral 
intercondylar notch, while retracting the patella and patella tendon medially to avoid 
ligament damage. The needle is advanced down to the femoral head, which is approximately 
5–10 mm depending on the size of the mouse, and 10 μL of cell suspension is slowly 
injected into the femur. (Intramuscular injections) The mouse is restrained gently but firmly 
by the scruff method. The rear foot nearest to the investigator is secured beneath the little 
finger and lower thumb. The area to be injected is swabbed with 70% ethanol. The needle is 
inserted, bevel up, into the caudal thigh at a 45 degree angle and 50–100 μL of cell 
suspension is slowly injected into the muscle while avoiding injury to the sciatic nerve. 
(Intravitreal injections)C57BL/6 scid mice are given general anesthesia via isoflurane 
inhalation continuously at 1–3% concentration with an oxygen flow rate of 2 Liter/minute. 
The mouse is placed under the microscope where the eye is proptosed and a small incision 
using the tip of an 18 gauge needle is created between the sclera and the cornea. Using a 5 
μL glass Hamilton syringe (Hamilton Company, 7633-01, 65RN), cells are injected through 
a 33 gauge small hub needle into the vitreous of the eye at 5 μL per injection. (Para-adrenal 
injections) All ultrasound procedures are performed using the VEVO 2100 high frequency 
ultrasound equipped with a MS-550S transducer running at 40 MHz. Recipient 
immunocompromised mice are given general anesthesia via isoflurane inhalation

 continuously at 1–3% concentration with an oxygen flow rate of 2 Liter/minute. 
Anesthetized recipients are placed laterally on the imaging bed with left flank facing 
upward. In order to provide a channel for delivery of the implant, a 22 gauge catheter (BD 
Worldwide, Cat# 381423) is gently inserted through the skin and back muscle into the para-
adrenal region and the hub is removed. A chilled 50 μL Hamilton glass syringe (Hamilton 
Cat# 80920) fitted with a 27 gauge 1.5 inch needle is loaded with 10 μl of suspension and 
guided steretoactically through the catheter and positioned between the kidney and adrenal 
gland using ultrasound. The cell suspension is then injected into the region and the needle is 
left in place for 30 seconds to permit the matrigel component to set. The needle is then 
slowly removed, followed by gentle removal of the catheter. The mouse is placed in a clean 
cage on a warmer to recover from anesthesia. (Flank implantation) For some tumor with 
sufficient material, we implanted tissue into the flank of immunocompromised mice as a 
backup to the orthotopic injection. Recipient immunocompromised mice are given general 
anesthesia via isoflurane inhalation continuously at 1–3% concentration with an oxygen 
flow rate of 2 Liter/minute. The mouse is placed ventral side down with a nose-cone to 
provide continuous anesthesia. The area from mid-spine to the tail base is cleaned with 70% 
ethanol. A small horizontal 5mm incision in the flank area is made using sterile small 
surgical scissors. The tip of the sterile scissors is inserted into the incision, directly over the 
flank, and the scissors are opened to introduce a pocket in the subcutaneous space. One 
individual piece of tumor tissue is inserted into the pocket using sterile forceps. One drop of 
100X penicillin/streptomycin solution is inserted into the opening over the tissue piece. The 
incision is closed with Vetbond tissue adhesive (3M Cat# 1469SB). The overlying skin is 
held together for 3–5 seconds with forceps to allow adequate time for drying.
Enzymatic Tumor Dissociation
(Neuroblastoma) Tumor was minced with sterile scalpels and rinsed in phosphate buffered 
saline without calcium or magnesium (PBS-minus solution). Tumor suspension was 
transferred to a 50 mL conical tube and filled with PBS-minus solution. Dissociation was 
done by adding 600 μl of trypsin (10 mg/ml, Sigma Cat#T9935) and tube placed in 37 
degree water bath for 10 minutes. Dissociation was stopped by adding 60μL of Soybean 
Trypsin Inhibitor (10 mg/ml, Sigma Cat#T6522). Deoxyribonuclease I (2 mg/ml, Sigma 
Cat#D4513) and magnesium chloride (1 M) were added in equal amounts of 60 μL 
increments until tumor fragments easily settle at the bottom of the tube. Tumor suspension is 
filtered with a 40 micron cell strainer and then centrifuged at 500g (g=RCF) for 5 minutes. 
Supernatant was discarded and 10 ml of red blood cell lysis solution (5 Prime Cat#2301310) 
added and allowed to incubate at room temperature for 10 minutes. Solution of phosphate 
buffered saline without calcium or magnesium (PBS-minus, Lonza Cat#17-516F)/10% Fetal 
Bovine Serum (FBS, Biowest Cat#SO1520) was added to fill 50 ml conical tube and cell 
suspension centrifuged at 500g (g=RCF) for 5 minutes. Supernatant was discarded and cell 
pellet was resuspended in PBS-minus/10%FBS for counting. Cells were then resuspended in 
Matrigel™ basement membrane matrix (BD Biosicences cat. 354234) at a concentration of 
2 × 105 cells per 10 μL and placed on ice for injection. (Soft tissue sarcoma) Tumor was 
placed through a tumor press and then rinsed with Dulbecco’s modified Eagle’s medium 
(DMEM) (Lonza catalog no. 12- 604F). The tumor suspension was transferred to a 50 ml 
conical tube and filled with DMEM. Dissociation was done by adding 600 μL of trypsin (10

Biochemical catalog no. 4177), and then the tube was placed in a 37C water bath for 1 hour. 
Dissociation was stopped by adding 600 μL of soybean trypsin inhibitor (10 mg/ml; Sigma 
catalog no. T6522). Deoxyribonuclease I (2 mg/ml; Sigma catalog no. D4513) and 
magnesium chloride (1 M) were added in equal amounts in 60 μL increments until tumor 
fragments easily settled at the bottom of the tube. The tumor suspension was filtered with a 
40 micron cell strainer and centrifuged at 500g (g=RCF) for 5 min. The supernatant was 
discarded, and 10 ml of red blood cell lysis solution (5 PRIME catalog no. 2301310) was 
added and allowed to incubate at room temperature for 10 min. A solution of PBS without 
calcium or magnesium (PBS-minus; Lonza catalog no. 17-516F)/10% fetal bovine serum 
(FBS) (Biowest catalog no. SO1520) was added to fill a 50 ml conical tube, and the cell 
suspension was centrifuged at 500g for 5 min. The supernatant was discarded, and the cell 
pellet was resuspended in PBS-minus/10% FBS for counting. Cells were then resuspended 
in matrigel (BD Worldwide catalog no. 354234) at a concentration of 1 × 106 per 100 μL 
and placed on ice for injection. (Osteosarcoma) The tumor was placed through a tumor press 
and then rinsed with PBS without calcium or magnesium (PBS-minus; Lonza catalog no. 
17-516F). The tumor suspension was transferred to 100 ml screw cap glass bottle and filled 
with PBS-minus to the 100 ml mark. Dissociation was done by adding 600 μL of trypsin (10 
mg/ml; Sigma catalog no. T9935) and 200 mg of type II collagenase (275 U/mg; 
Worthington Biochemical catalog no. 4177), and placed in a warm 37 degree water bath for 
90 min, agitating with a magnetic bead at ~200 rpm aiming to have all tissue circulating and 
lifted off the bottom of the glass bottle. Dissociation was stopped by adding 600 μL of 
soybean trypsin inhibitor (10 mg/ml; Sigma catalog no. T6522). Deoxyribonuclease I (2 
mg/ml; Sigma catalog no. D4513) and magnesium chloride (1 M) were added in equal 
amounts in 60 μL increments until tumor fragments easily settled at the bottom of the tube. 
The tumor suspension was filtered with a 70 micron cell strainer and centrifuged at 500 g 
(g=RCF) for 5 min. The supernatant was discarded, and 10 ml of red blood cell lysis 
solution (5 PRIME catalog no. 2301310) was added and allowed to incubate at room 
temperature for 10 min. A solution of PBS-minus/10% fetal bovine serum (FBS) (Biowest 
catalog no. SO1520) was added to fill a 50 ml conical tube, and the cell suspension was 
centrifuged at 500 g for 5 min. The supernatant was discarded, and the cell pellet was 
resuspended in PBS-minus/10% FBS for counting. Cells were then resuspended in 
Matrigel™ basement membrane matrix (BD Biosicences cat. 354234) at a concentration of 
1 × 106 cells per 10 μL and placed on ice for injection. (Retinoblastoma) Tumor was minced 
with sterile scalpels and rinsed in RPMI (Lonza catalog no 12-167F). Tumor suspension was 
transferred to a 50 mL conical tube and filled with RPMI. Dissociation was done by adding 
600 μL of trypsin (10 mg/ml, Sigma Cat#T9935) and tube placed in 37 degree water bath for 
10 minutes. Dissociation was stopped by adding 600 μL of Soybean Trypsin Inhibitor (10 
mg/ml, Sigma Cat#T6522). Deoxyribonuclease I (2 mg/ml, Sigma Cat#D4513) and 
magnesium chloride (1 M) were added in equal amounts of 60 μL increments until tumor 
fragments easily settle at the bottom of the tube. Tumor suspension is filtered with a 40 
micron cell strainer and then centrifuged at 500g (G=RCF) for 5 minutes. Supernatant was

 Serum (FBS, Biowest Cat#SO1520) was added to fill 50 ml conical tube and cell suspension 
centrifuged at 500g (G=RCF) for 5 minutes. Supernatant was discarded and cell pellet was 
resuspended in PBS-minus/10%FBS for counting. Cells were then resuspended in RPMI at a 
concentration of 1 × 105 cells per 5 μL for injection.
Tumor cryopreservation
After dissociation, tumor cells that were not utilized for passaging or high throughput 
screening were cryopreserved for banking and later usage. Cells were counted and 
resuspended in chilled FBS/10% DMSO at a concentration of 6 × 106 cells per 1 ml per tube 
for all tumor types with the exception of retinoblastoma at a concentration of 1 × 106 cells 
per 1 ml. Cryo tubes were placed in styrofoam containers and frozen at −80° C for 3 days 
and then transferred to liquid nitrogen for long term storage.
Histopathologic scoring
Histopathologic features of the patient H&E-stained slides and the O-PDX derived slides 
were compared for histologic similarity. These patient-xenograft pairs were placed into 
similarity categories based on evaluation of the following attributes: overall tumor 
cellularity, growth pattern, cytomorphology including degree of pleomorphism, and mitotic 
activity. The following classification system was used:
Same: No difference noted between patient and xenograft-derived samples.
Similar: Changes in growth pattern and overall cellularity allowed with no 
difference in pleomorphism or mitotic activity.
Morphologic Shift: Significant change such that the two lesions are 
morphologically dissimilar with significant difference in cellularity, 
cytomorphologic features, degree of pleomorphism, growth pattern, and mitotic 
activity.
Immunohistochemical Staining and Scoring
Patient samples and the matched xenograft tissues were assessed for Caspase 3 (total), 
Caspase 3 (cleaved), and Ki-67. In addition, a number of diagnostically delineating markers 
were performed based on the histopathologic diagnosis and included: Fli-1 (Ewing 
sarcoma), Vimentin (high-grade sarcoma not otherwise specified), S100-protein 
(liposarcoma), INI-1 (malignant rhabdoid tumor), CRX (retinoblastoma), synaptophysin 
(neuroblastoma), SATB2 (osteosarcoma), and myogenin and MyoD1 (rhabdomyosarcoma). 
In total, excluding controls, 446 immunohistochemical stained slides were reviewed and 
scored. 51 xenograft samples were reviewed by H&E staining, as were all pertinent slides 
from the primary patient specimens (~676 H&E stained slides). Total slides examined 
microscopically: 1,173. Formalin-fixed paraffin embedded tissue (4 μm in thickness) was 
utilized for staining with appropriate positive and negative controls evaluated. The 
antibodies are provided in Supplementary Table 2. Patient sample-xenograft pairs were 
evaluated for overall immunohistochemical concordance. Cases were considered discordant 
if any of the selected diagnostic markers (Fli-1, Vimentin, S100-protein, INI-1, SATB2, and 
CRX) were discrepant (positive vs. negative in the tumor cells). Only the expected

 localization of staining was considered evidence of positivity (or loss of staining as is the 
case with INI-1). As Myogenin and MyoD1 are known to display different degrees of 
positivity in rhabdomyosarcoma subtypes, these stains were scored to the nearest 5% of 
nuclear positivity. A case was considered discordant if there was >25% discrepancy between 
the estimated percentages for either Myogenin or MyoD1 between the patient and xenograft 
samples. Histology images were obtained using Aperio® ImageScope (Leica Biosystems).
Electron microscopy
Tumor samples were fixed with 2.5% glutaraldehyde, 2% parqaformadehyde in 0.1 M 
sodium cacodylate buffer pH 7.4 and post fixed in 2% osmium tetroxide in 0.1 M cacodylate 
buffer with 0.3% potassium ferrocyanide for 1.5 hours. After rinsing in same buffer the 
tissue was dehydrated through a series of graded ethanol to propylene oxide, infiltrated and 
embedded in epoxy resin and polymerized at 70° C overnight. Semithin sections (0.5 
micron) were stained with toluidine blue for light microscope examination. Ultrathin 
sections (80 nm) were cut and imaged using an FEI Tecnai 200Kv FEG Electron 
Microscope with an ATM XR41 Digital Camera.
Whole Genome Sequencing
Whole genome sequencing and library construction was performed as described 
previously17–19 with the following modifications; 250–500 ng of genomic DNA was input 
for library construction using Illumina compatible adapters, and 4–6 cycles of amplification 
was performed with Kapa HiFi Hotstart ReadyMix (KAPA Biosystems). Identification of 
SNV, CNVs, SVs and Indels was performed as described previously17–19.
Whole Exome Sequencing
Whole exome sequencing was conducted using the SeqCap EZ HGSC VCRome (Roche) 
according to manufactures instructions.
RNA Preparation and RNA-Seq
RNA was isolated from individual TRIzol (Life Technologies) preparations via a phenol-
chloroform extraction. Samples were first homogenized at 17,000 rpm for 30 seconds with a 
tissue homogenizer (Polytron, PT10-35GT). A 1:4 volume of chloroform (Sigma) was then 
added to each sample and incubated at room temperature for 3 minutes followed by 
centrifugation at 12,000 rcf at 4°C for 15 minutes. The aqueous layer was then transferred to 
a siliconized eppendorf tube followed by the addition of 2.0 μL glycogen (Roche) and 500 
μL isopropanol (Fisher). Samples were incubated at room temperature for 10 minutes 
followed by centrifugation at 12,000 rcf at 4°C for 15 minutes. Samples were then washed 
twice with ice-cold 80% EtOH (Fisher) to remove salts, resuspended in DEPC H20, and the 
concentration was determined with a Nanodrop (Thermoscientific). RNA was extracted from 
freshly isolated retinas using RNeasy Plus Mini kit (Qiagen #74134). Libraries were 
prepared from approximately 500 ng total RNA with the TruSeq Stranded Total RNA 
Library Prep Kit according to the manufacturer’s directions (Illumina). Paired-end 100-cycle 
sequencing was performed on HiSeq 2000 or HiSeq 2500 sequencers, per the 
manufacturer’s directions (Illumina). Gene based FPKM quantification in RNA-Seq was

 performed as described previously1. Spearman correlation was calculated for each primary 
tumor-O-PDX pair.
Clonal analysis
Targeted enrichment was performed using the Seqcap EZchoice Kit (Roche) according to 
vendor instructions for the Kapa workflow with 500 ng of genomic DNA as the starting 
input for library construction. Clonal analysis was performed as described previously1. To 
test for clonal changes within different regions of a single tumor, a subset of orthotopic 
xenograft tumors were harvested for segmental clonal analysis. The excised tumor was cut in 
half with the cut edge facing upwards. Each tumor half was visually segmented into 4 
quadrants and a biopsy punch needle was used to sample the tissue in each quadrant 
producing 8 samples from a single tumor. Clonal analysis was performed for each of the 8 
quadrant samples as described above. Samples were divided into 4 groups based on the 
tumor clonal evolution between primary and O-PDX tumors: Group 1 O-PDX tumors 
retained the clonal structure of the primary tumor. Group 2 O-PDX tumors acquired 
significant amount of new mutations compared to the matching primary tumor. A minor 
clone in the primary tumor was lost in O-PDX tumors in Group 3 samples. In Group 4 
samples, O-PDX tumors were derived from a minor clone in the primary tumor.
ChIP-Seq
SJRHB000026_X1, SJRHB010463_X16, SJOS001112_X1 and SJNBL046_X were 
submitted to Active Motif® for ChIP-sequencing for 7 histone marks (H3K27Ac, 
H3K27me3, H3K36me3, H3K4me1, H3K4me2, H3K4me3, H3K9-14Ac, H3K9me3), RNA 
Pol II, CTCF, and BRD4. We first employ BWA (version 0.5.9-r26-dev, default parameter) 
to align the ChIP-Seq reads to human genome hg19(GRCh37-lite). Picard(version 
1.65(1160)) then have been used for marking duplicated reads. Then only non-duplicated 
reads with have been kept by samtools (parameter “-q 1 -F 1024” version 0.1.18 (r982:295)). 
We followed the ENCODE criterion to quality control (QC) the data that non-duplicated 
version of SPP (version 1.11) have been used to draw cross-correlation and calculated 
relative strand correlation value (RSC) under support of R (version 2.14.0) with packages 
caTools(version 1.17) and bitops(version 1.0–6) and estimated the fragment size. We 
required > 10M unique mapped reads for point-source factor (H3K4me2/3, H3K9/14Ac, 
H3K27Ac, CTCF, RNAPolII, BRD4) and RSC > 1. We required 20M unique mapped reads 
for broad markers (H3K9me3, H3K27me3, H3K36me3). We required 10M unique mapped 
reads for INPUTs and RSC < 1. We noticed H3K4me1 is point-source factor in some stages 
while broad in other stages so we QC H3K4me1 as broad markers. Then upon manually 
inspection, the cross-correlation plot generated by SPP, the best fragment size estimated (the 
smallest fragment size estimated by SPP in all our cases) were used to extend each reads and 
generate bigwig file to view on IGV (version 2.3.40). All profiles were manually inspected 
for clear peaks and good signal to noise separation.
Chromatin Hidden Markov Modeling
Non-duplicated aligned reads were extend by fragment size define above and ChromHMM 
(version 1.10, with “-colfields 0,1,2,5 –center” for BinarizeBed) was used for chromatin 
state modeling. To choose the state number we first modeled all mouse development stages

 together from 7 states to 33 states and selected the model with 16 states upon manual 
inspection. For better visualization of the dynamics of HMM state across stages, we 
normalized color intensity by the max total percentage of a state covering a gene and 
flanking region. To determine the best region representing a gene, we first filter annotated 
isoforms by TSS within 2kb of any H3K4me3/H3K4me2/H3K27Ac/H3K9-14Ac peaks at 
any development stage and then we selected the highest expressed isoform at any 
development stage estimated by cuffdiff or the longest isoform if no expression level 
estimated by cuffdiff. At last, we reduced the interval for a HMM state to half bar and the 
intensity to half of the normalized intensity if it didn’t ranked top 2 HMM state for a gene. 
As HMM states could be assigned by multiple genes, the max total percentage across genes 
has been used for normalization. Percentage of HMM states were calculated for individual 
genes across 4 tumors with ChIP-seq profiles. Tumor type specific up-regulated genes were 
selected based on the following criteria: differentially expressed among tumor types (FDR < 
0.05), highly expressed in the specific tumor type (FPKM > 8), and highly overexpressed 
compared to other tumors (at least 4-fold higher). Tumor type specific repressed genes were 
selected as: differentially expressed among tumor types (FDR < 0.05), highly expressed in at 
least 1other tumor type (FPKM > 8), and highly repressed compared to other tumors (at least 
4-fold lower). Tumor type specific epigenetically regulated genes were selected as tumor 
specific up-regulated or repressed genes with at least one state with a fraction change >= 
0.25 between the specific tumor and other tumors.
Statistical analysis
The p values were adjusted for multiple comparisons using the Benjamini & Hochberg 
method20. For comparing engraftment efficiency, we used the MedCalc software (https://
www.medcalc.org/calc/comparison_of_proportions.php) for comparison of proportions 
using the N-1 Chi-squared test as recommended by Cambell and Richardson21,22. For 
comparison of time to engraftment, we used the comparison of means on MedCalc. Pre-
study consultation for the preclinical phase III study was done with the Department of 
Biostatistics at St. Jude Children’s Research Hospital. The data include a total of 140 mice 
treated in 4 different treatment groups from 4 O-PDX models. The goal of the study was to 
assess and compare the tumor response and tumor progression free survival among treatment 
groups. Mice were randomized into each treatment group with a randomization code 
provided by the Department of Biostatistics. The survival curves of time to tumor 
progression were generated by Kaplan-Meier method. The log-rank tests were used to 
compare survival curves in each sub-group. Tumor response was defined by 
bioluminescence at the end of therapy as shown in the tables below. If a mouse was taken off 
study at any point in time after enrollment due to tumor size greater than 20% of mouse 
weight, they were automatically assigned a response of progressive disease. Signals less than 
105 photons/sec/cm2/sr were classified as a complete response (CR). Animals with signal 
between 105–106 were classified as partial response (PR). Stable disease (SD) was the same 
as enrollment signal 106–108 photons/sec/cm2/sr and progressive disease (PD) was greater 
than 108 photons/sec/cm2/sr. The observed response data were recorded in Supplementary 
Tables 7 and 8. The results showed that the triple combination AZD1755 + Irinotecan + 
VCR had the highest complete response (CR) rate 40% (4/10) for SJRHB013757_X2, 90% 
(9/10) for SJRHB013759_X1, 37.5% (3/8) for SJRHB000026_X1, 22% (2/9) for

 SJRHB012_Y, 65% (13/20) for both ARMS O-PDXs and 29% (5/17) for both ERMS O-
PDXs combined. Time to tumor progression was defined as time interval between date of 
enrollment and date of tumor size > 20% of mouse weight or xenogen signal > 108 at the 
end of study. The survival probabilities at day 25, day 66 and day 126 for treatment groups 
were summarized in following tables. Again, two triple combination AZD1755 + Irino + 
VCR had the highest progression-free survival probabilities with survival probabilities at the 
end of study (day 126) 100%, 100%, 62.5%, 55.6%, 100% and 59% for SJRHB013757_X2, 
SJRHB013759_X1, SJRHB000026_X1, SJRHB012_Y, alveolar combined and embryonal 
combined, respectively.
The Kaplan-Meier survival curves were given in Figures with log-rank test p-values (all log-
rank test p-values were 0 for the comparisons among 4 treatment groups for all studies).
Cell screening
(Plating Density and DMSO-Sensitivity) Cells from each tumor model were plated on a flat-
bottomed, white 384-well plate (Corning Cat#8804BC), at 6–8 different cell densities 
ranging from 125 cells/well to 15000 cells/well. Twenty-four hours after plating, cells were 
treated with varying DMSO concentrations (0%, 0.083%, 0.197%, and 0.443% DMSO), 
resulting in twelve wells per cell density at a given DMSO concentration. Seventy-two hours 
following the addition of DMSO, CellTiter-Glo® (‘CTG’, Promega Cat#G7573) reagent 
was added at 25 μl/well and the plate was read using a PerkinElmer EnVision plate reader. 
The relative light unit (RLU) signal was processed to determine which plating density 
yielded optimal signal to noise separation while maintaining logarithmic growth at 72-hr 
post-plating and minimal DMSO sensitivity. (Positive Control Compound Selection) Cells 
from each tumor model were plated in a 384-well plate at optimal density as determined 
above. Twenty-four hours post-plating, cells were drugged with a compound plate 
containing six positive control compound candidates (doxorubicin HCl, staurosporine, 
etoposide, SN-38, bortezomib, and cycloheximide) arrayed at a high single-point 
concentration and in a 1:3 serial dilution series (16 points per series). At 72-hr post-
drugging, the plate was read using the CTG protocol described above. Positive controls were 
selected based on the compound’s ability to achieve complete cell killing (RLUs near 
background levels) with a well-defined, sigmoidal dose-response curve shape. We selected 
staurosporine (primary) and bortezomib (secondary) to be the positive controls for all drug 
sensitivity experiments. (Assay Validation) For each tumor model, we assessed the 
variability of the assay in 384-well plates by running the CTG assay using three independent 
plates with alternating max/min/mid control signals on at least two different days, and then 
examined Z-prime and other relevant statistics. The maximum signal corresponded to cells 
treated with DMSO only; the minimum signal had cells treated with ca. 30 uM 
staurosporine; and the mid signal used the cell line specific EC50 value for staurosporine 
determined during the positive control selection described above. In general, we observed no 
systematic location-dependent effect across wells, the three signal levels were well 
separated, and z-prime values were above 0.4. (Cell Culture Experiments in Dose Response) 
Cell lines were prepared via standard cell culture techniques. Xenograft cells were obtained 
from freshly dissociated tumors. Cell lines and O-PDX cells were counted and plated in 384 
well plates (Corning Cat#8804BC) and plating densities and plating conditions are shown in 
Stewart et al.

 Supplementary Table 6. 24 hours following plating, each cell line or O-PDX sample was 
drugged with both a compound plate(s) and a positive control plate using a Biomek FX 
(Beckman Coulter) liquid handler equipped with a pin tool. Compounds were obtained as 
dry powder and dissolved in DMSO to a target concentration of either 10mM or 2mM (for 
compounds with reported high cellular potency or solubility limitations). The pin tool 
transferred ca. 65 nL compound stock, resulting in ca. 370-fold compound dilution. At 72-hr 
post-drugging, cells were lysed with the addition of 25 μL/well CTG reagent as described 
above. The compound plate contained compounds dissolved in DMSO arrayed in a 1:3 fold 
dilution series in columns 1–20 with 32 compounds per plate. The positive control plate was 
empty from columns 1–20; in columns 21–24, it contained single-point and 1:3 serial 
dilutions of the primary and secondary positive controls (staurosporine and bortezomib, 
respectively) dissolved in DMSO to give ca. 10 mM top stock concentration, and also wells 
containing DMSO alone (negative control). There were three technical replicates per 
biological replicate. The purity of each compound used in these studies was verified to be 
>95% using UV UV/TWC and evaporative light scattering detection (ELSD) spectroscopy, 
and the concentration of each solution was quantified using nitrogen chemo-luminescence 
where possible.
Cell screening analysis
(Raw data processing – log2 RLU dose-response fits) Raw luminescence RLU (relative light 
unit) values for each compound at each concentration were log2 transformed, normalized to 
obtain % activity using the following equation: 100* [(mean(negctrl) – compound)/
(mean(negctrl) – mean(posctrl))]; and then pooled from replicate experiments prior to 
fitting. Here, negctrl and posctrl refer to the negative and positive controls on each plate. 
Outliers for controls were detected using the robust statistic (below the [first quartile – 
1.5×IQR] or above the [third quartile + 1.5×IQR], where IQR = interquartile range), and 
removed prior to calculating mean values. (QC metrics) The z-prime statistic was calculated 
using the following formula: 1 − ((3×sd(negctrl)) + (3×sd(posctrl)))/abs(mean(negctrl) – 
mean(posctrl)). Outliers among the negative and positive controls were removed as 
described above prior to the calculation of the mean and standard deviation statistics. Of the 
1960 plates screened in total for this project, 49 (2.5%) had z-prime < 0 and were excluded 
from further analysis. Of the remaining plates, the average z-prime was 0.57, and 95% of all 
plates has z-prime between 0.27 and 0.82. (Fitting log2 RLU dose-response curves) Dose-
response curves were fit using the drc [REF: Ritz et al. Bioassay Analysis using R, Journal 
of Statistical Software, 2005, 12, 5] package in R [REF: R Core Team (2012). R: A language 
and environment for statistical computing. R Foundation for Statistical Computing, Vienna, 
Austria. ISBN 3-900051-07-0, URL http://www.R-project.org/]. Both a three parameter 
(with y0, the response without drug, set to zero) and a four parameter model (y0 allowed to 
vary) were fit using the sigmoidal function LL2.4. The hill slope was constrained to be 
between −10 and 0, and ec50 was constrained to be between 10−10 and 10−4 (which equated 
to the drug concentration range tested in these experiments). For the 3 parameter model, 
yFin, the maximum response of the dose-response curve, was constrained to be between 
zero and the maximum of the median activities calculated at each concentration over all 
pooled measurements. For the 4 parameter model, y0 and yFin were both constrained to be 
between the minimum and the maximum of the median activities calculated at each

 concentration over all pooled measurements. Values from the highest concentration tested 
for each compound were weighted at 10% to reduce curve fitting artifacts. The model with 
the lowest corrected Akaike information criterion (AICc) was selected as the best fit model. 
Area under the curve (auc) was calculated from the fitted curve using the trapezoid rule. In 
the event of a failure to fit a sigmoidal dose response curve, the smooth.spline option in R 
was used to fit a curve that could be used to determine area under the curve. (Growth rate 
determination) Growth rates for each tumor cell model in this study were determined by 
quantifying RLU values at days 1–4 following cell plating at densities ranging from 39 to 
15,000 cells/well. RLU values were log2 transformed to fit a linear model with y-intercept 
constrained to zero. The resulting slope was the change in log2 RLU signal per day. A value 
of 1 meant one doubling of RLU signal per day. (Dose-response analysis based on observed 
growth rate) We fit a three parameter model using the sigmoidal function LL2.4 in the drc 
package by regressing against the ‘observed growth rate’ as a function of concentration. The 
observed growth rate was calculated by estimating x0 from xctrl (given the growth rate of a 
specific tumor model as determined above, and the number of days of growth – 4 days in 
these experiments), and then determining the growth rate required to produce x(c), the cell 
count in the presence of drug at concentration c at the end of the experiment (4 days). We 
assumed cell count was proportional to RLU, and thus performed all calculations using 
RLU. For these regressions, the value of y0 was set to the growth rate for untreated cells and 
the following constraints were employed: 10 ≤ hill slope ≤ 0; minimum of the median 
observed growth rate in the presence of drug calculated at each concentration over all pooled 
measurements ≤ yFin ≤ growth rate for untreated cells; 10−10 ≤ ec50 ≤ 10−4. As before, 
observed growth rates from the highest concentration tested for each compound were 
weighted at 10% to reduce curve fitting artifacts. Two useful metrics were calculated from 
the dose-response curves based on observed growth rates. ED0 is the effective dose required 
to achieve zero growth, or cytostatic behavior. For curves that never reach zero observed 
growth rate, this value was set to the highest concentration tested. For curves from tumor 
models with a negative growth rate, this value was set to the lowest concentration tested. The 
second metric, AUC0, is the area under the curve where the observed growth rate dose-
response curve is below zero.
Pharmacokinetics
(AZD1775) The total plasma and tumor homogenate PK of AZD1775 in female tumor-
bearing athymic nude mice (Jax Laboratories, aged 8–16 weeks) was assessed after a single 
oral gavage dose of 120 mg/kg. AZD1775 (AbMole, M2143, purity >98%, MolWt 500.60) 
was suspended in 0.5% methylcellulose (type 400 cPs, Sigma) at a nominal concentration of 
12 mg/mL for a 10 mL/kg gavage volume. Mice were sacrificed using an IACUC-approved 
method at 30 min, 1, 2, 4, and 8 hr post-dose, with 3 mice per time point. Whole blood was 
collected with sodium heparin via cardiac puncture, immediately centrifuged to plasma, and 
stored on dry ice for remainder of study. Mice were then perfused with PBS via the aorta, 
the RMS orthotopic xenografts excised from the hind limb, rinsed with PBS, and placed on 
dry ice. At the end of the in vivo procedures, all samples were transferred from dry ice and 
placed at −80 °C until analysis. Total plasma and tumor homogenate AZD1775 
concentrations were assessed using a sensitive and specific liquid chromatography, tandem 
mass spectrometry assay. First, tumor samples were macerated, diluted with a 5:1 volume of

 Ringer Solution (Frey Scientific), and homogenized with a bead-based technique7 on a 
FastPrep-24 system (MP Biomedicals, Santa Ana, CA). Steel lysing matrix beads (MP 
Biomedicals, Metal Bead Lysing Matrix, 3 mg per mg of tumor) were added to the 
microcentrifuge tubes containing samples. The samples were then subjected to three 60 M/S 
vibratory cycles of 1 min each on the FastPrep-24 system. To prevent over-heating due to 
friction, samples were placed on wet ice for 5 min between each cycle. The homogenates 
were then stored at −80 °C until analysis. AZD1775 (AbMole, M2143, purity >98%) stock 
solutions were prepared in methanol and used to spike matrix calibrators and quality 
controls. Plasma and tumor homogenate samples, 25 μL each, were protein precipitated with 
100 μL of 5 ng/mL crizotinib (ApexBio, A8802, Batch 1, purity >99%) in methanol as an 
internal standard. A 2 μL aliquot of the extracted supernatant was injected onto a Shimadzu 
LC-20ADXR high performance liquid chromatography system via a LEAP CTC PAL 
autosampler. The LC separation was performed using a Phenomenex Synergi Hydro-RP 80Å 
LC column (4.0 μm, 30 mm × 2.0 mm) maintained at 60 °C with gradient elution at a flow 
rate of 0.35 mL/min. The binary mobile phase consisted of 0.1% formic acid in ultra-pure 
water in reservoir A and 0.1% formic acid in methanol in reservoir B. The initial mobile 
phase consisted of 5% B with a linear increase to 70% B in 1.5 minutes. The column was 
then rinsed for 2.5 minutes at 100% B and then equilibrated at the initial conditions for 2 
minutes for a total run time of 6 minutes. Under these conditions, the analyte and IS eluted 
at 0.98 and 0.93 minutes, respectively. Analyte and IS were detected with tandem mass 
spectrometry using a SCIEX API 5500 Q-TRAP in the positive ESI mode with monitoring 
of the following mass transitions: AZD1775 501.20 −> 442.20, crizotinib 450.10 −> 260.20. 
The method qualification and bioanalytical runs all passed our acceptance criteria for non-
GLP assay performance. A quadratic model (1/X2 weighting) fit the calibrators across the 
0.5 to 100 ng/mL range, with a correlation coefficient (R) of ≥0.9982. The lower limit of 
quantitation (LLOQ), defined as a peak area signal-to-noise ratio of 5 or greater verses a 
matrix blank with IS, was 0.5 ng/mL. The intra-run precision and accuracy was < 6.28% CV 
and 88.2% to 107%, respectively. The resultant AZD1775 concentration-time (Ct) data were 
grouped by matrix and time point, and summary statistics (arithmetic mean, standard 
deviation, %CV, minimum, median, maximum) generated using R software8. The AZD1775 
arithmetic mean Ct data for each matrix was then subjected to noncompartmental 
pharmacokinetic analysis (NCA) using Phoenix WinNonlin 6.4 (Certara USA, Inc., 
Princeton, NJ). The extravascular model (Model 202) was applied, and area under the Ct 
curve (AUC) values were estimated using the “linear up log down” method. The terminal 
phase was defined as the three time points at the end of the Ct profile, and the elimination 
rate constant (Ke) was estimated using an unweighted log-linear regression of the terminal 
phase. The terminal elimination half-life (T1/2) was estimated as 0.693/Ke, and the AUC 
from time 0 to infinity (AUCinf) was estimated as the AUC to the last time point (AUClast) 
+ predicted Clast/Ke. Other NCA parameters estimated included observed maximum 
concentration (Cmax), time of Cmax (Tmax), concentration at the last observed time point 
(Clast), time of Clast (Tlast), apparent clearance (CL/F = Dose/AUCinf), and apparent 
terminal volume of distribution (Vz/F). The average concentration over a dosing interval 
(Cavg) was estimated as AUCinf/dosing interval in hours. The apparent partition coefficient 
of AZD1775 from the plasma to tumor (Kp,tumor) was estimated as the ratio of the AUCinf, 
tumor to AUCinf plasma when available. To estimate a clinically relevant mouse dosage, the

 resultant mouse plasma AUCinf and Cavg was compared with the reported human plasma 
PK values at the putative single agent AZD1775 maximum tolerated dose or Phase 2 
recommended dose23. All inferences were made under the assumption of time-independent, 
linear and dose-proportional PK in mice and humans. (Bortezomib) The total plasma and 
tumor PK of bortezomib in tumor-bearing female athymic nude mice (Jax Laboratories, 
aged 8–16 weeks) was assessed after a single intraperitoneal (IP) injection of 1 mg/kg. 
Bortezomib (LC Labs, Lot BBZ-106, purity >99%, MolWt 384.24) was dissolved in DMSO 
and further diluted with 0.9% sodium chloride for injection, USP (NS, Baxter) for a final 
nominal concentration of 0.1 mg/mL in 2% DMSO/98% NS and a 10 mL/kg injection 
volume. The IP route was found to be a convenient method, given the intermittent twice 
weekly dosing required in efficacy studies. Mice were sacrificed using an IACUC-approved 
method at 10 min, 1, 3, 24, and 72 hr post-dose, with 3 mice per time point. Whole blood 
was collected with sodium heparin via cardiac puncture, immediately centrifuged to plasma, 
and stored on dry ice for remainder of study. Mice were then perfused with PBS via the 
aorta, the RMS orthotopic xenograft tumors excised, rinsed with PBS, and placed on dry ice. 
At the end of the in vivo procedures, all samples were transferred from dry ice and placed at 
-80 °C until analysis. Total plasma and tumor homogenate bortezomib concentrations were 
assessed using a sensitive and specific liquid chromatography, tandem mass spectrometry 
assay. First, tissue samples were macerated, diluted with a 5:1 volume of ultrapure water, 
and homogenized with a bead-based technique24 on a FastPrep-24 system (MP Biomedicals, 
Santa Ana, CA). Ceramic lysing matrix beads (MP Biomedicals, Ceramic Bead Lysing 
Matrix, 3 mg per mg of tissue) were added to the microcentrifuge tubes containing tumor 
samples. Samples were then subjected to three 60 M/S vibratory cycles of 1 min each on the 
FastPrep-24 system. To prevent over-heating due to friction, samples were placed on wet ice 
for 5 min between each cycle. The homogenates were then stored at −80 °C until analysis. 
Bortezomib (LC Labs, BBZ-106, purity >99%) stock solutions were prepared in 80% 
methanol/20% ultrapure water with 0.1% formic acid and used to spike matrix calibrators 
and quality controls. Plasma and tissue homogenate samples, 25 μL each, were treated with 
10 μL of internal standard (bortezomib-d8, Toronto Research Chemicals, 3-GBH-170-2, 
purity 98%) 50 ng/mL spiking solution and then protein precipitated with 100 μL of 
acetonitrile with 0.1% formic acid, vortexed vigorously for 1 minute and centrifuged at 4 °C 
and 13000g for 5 minutes. A 3 μL aliquot of the extracted supernatant was injected onto a 
Shimadzu LC-20ADXR high performance liquid chromatography system via a Shimadzu 
SIL-20ACXR autosampler. The LC separation was performed using a Phenomenex Luna C8 
80Å LC column (4.0 μm, 30 mm × 2.0 mm) maintained at ambient temperature with 
gradient elution at a flow rate of 0.25 mL/min. The binary mobile phase consisted of 0.1% 
formic acid in ultra-pure water in reservoir A and 0.1% formic acid in acetonitrile in 
reservoir B. The initial mobile phase consisted of 30% B with a linear increase to 100% B in 
2 minutes. The column was then rinsed for 2.5 minutes at 100% B and then equilibrated at 
the initial conditions for 2 minutes for a total run time of 6.5 minutes. Under these 
conditions, the analyte and IS eluted at 2.56 and 2.53 minutes, respectively. Analyte and IS 
were detected with tandem mass spectrometry using a SCIEX API 4000 in the positive ESI 
mode with monitoring of the following mass transitions: bortezomib 367.4 −> 226.2, 
bortezomib-d8 374.8 −> 234.0. The experimental bioanalytical runs were all found to be 
acceptable for the purpose of a singlicate non-GLP, preclinical PK assessment. A linear

 model (1/X2 weighting) fit the calibrators across the 1 to 100 ng/mL range, with a 
correlation coefficient (R) of ≥0.99. Above the calibration range quality control samples 
were diluted with adequate precision and accuracy. The lower limit of quantitation (LLOQ), 
defined as a peak area signal-to-noise ratio of 5 or greater verses a matrix blank with IS, was 
1 ng/mL for plasma and 6 ng/mL for tissues due to the dilution factor. The intra-run 
precision and accuracy was < 5.56% CV and 87.1% to 107%, respectively across the 
matrices. The resultant bortezomib concentration-time (Ct) data were grouped by matrix and 
time point, and manual imputation of data below the lower limit of quantitation (BLOQ) was 
as follows: IF at any time point ≥ 2/3rds of the Ct results were above the LLOQ, the BLOQ 
data were replaced with a value of ½ LLOQ, ELSE the entire time point’s data were treated 
as missing. Then, using Phoenix WinNonlin 6.4 (Certara USA, Inc., Princeton, NJ), Ct data 
summary statistics (arithmetic mean, standard deviation, %CV, minimum, median, 
maximum) were generated, and the bortezomib arithmetic mean Ct data for each matrix was 
subjected to noncompartmental pharmacokinetic analysis (NCA). The extravascular model 
(Model 202) was applied, and area under the Ct curve (AUC) values were estimated using 
the “linear up log down” trapezoidal rule. The terminal phase was defined as the two to three 
time points at the end of the Ct profile, and the elimination rate constant (Ke) was estimated 
using an unweighted log-linear regression of the terminal phase. The terminal elimination 
half-life (T1/2) was estimated as 0.693/Ke, and the AUC from time 0 to infinity (AUCinf) 
was estimated as the AUC to the last time point (AUClast) + predicted Clast/Ke. Other NCA 
parameters estimated included observed maximum concentration (Cmax), time of Cmax 
(Tmax), concentration at the last observed time point (Clast), time of Clast (Tlast), apparent 
clearance (CL/F = Dose/AUCinf), and apparent terminal volume of distribution (Vz/F). The 
average concentration over a dosing interval (Cavg) was estimated as AUCinf/dosing 
interval in hours. The apparent partition coefficient of bortezomib from the plasma to the 
tissue of interest (Kp,tissue) was estimated as the ratio of the AUCinf, tissue to AUCinf 
plasma when available. To estimate a clinically relevant mouse dosage, the resultant mouse 
plasma AUCinf and Cavg was compared with the reported human plasma PK values at the 
putative single agent bortezomib maximum tolerated dose at 1.3 mg/m2 IV on Day 11 of 
therapy25. All inferences were made under the assumption of time-independent, linear and 
dose-proportional PK in mice and humans. (Panobinostat) The total plasma and tissue PK of 
panobinostat in female tumor-bearing athymic nude mice (Jax Laboratories, aged 8–16 
weeks) was assessed after a single intraperitoneal (IP) injection of 20 mg/kg. Panobinostat 
(LC Labs, Lot PNB-101, purity >99%, MolWt 349.43) was suspended as the free base form 
in dextrose 5% for injection, USP (D5W, Baxter) at a nominal concentration of 2 mg/mL for 
a 10 mL/kg injection volume. The IP route was chosen given the low oral bioavailability 
reported in rodents,26 and as it appeared to be the preferred route in reviewed mouse 
studies27,28. Mice were sacrificed using an IACUC-approved method at 15 min, 40 min, 
2.25, 8, and 24 hr post-dose, with 3 mice per time point. Whole blood was collected with 
sodium heparin via cardiac puncture, immediately centrifuged to plasma, and stored on dry 
ice for remainder of study. Mice were then perfused with PBS via the aorta, the RMS 
orthotopic xenografts and tissues excised, rinsed with PBS, and placed on dry ice. At the end 
of the in vivo procedures, all samples were transferred from dry ice and placed at −80 °C

 assay. First, tissue samples were macerated, diluted with a 5:1 volume (for tumor and brain) 
or a 3.1–7.0:1 volume (for varying masses retina and vitreous) of ultrapure water, and 
homogenized with a bead-based technique7 on a FastPrep-24 system (MP Biomedicals, 
Santa Ana, CA). Ceramic lysing matrix beads (MP Biomedicals, Lysing Matrix D, 10 mg 
per mg of tissue) were added to the microcentrifuge tubes containing samples. The samples 
were then subjected to three 60 M/S vibratory cycles of 1 min each on the FastPrep-24 
system. To prevent over-heating due to friction, samples were placed on wet ice for 5 min 
between each cycle. The homogenates were then stored at −80 °C until analysis. 
Panobinostat (LC Labs, Lot PNB-101, purity >99%) stock solutions were prepared in 
methanol and used to spike matrix calibrators and quality controls. Plasma and tissue 
homogenate samples, 25 μL each, were protein precipitated with 100 μL of 240 ng/mL 
panobinostat-d8 hydrochloride salt (Toronto Research Chemicals, Inc., P180502, Lot 5-
KSS-175-5, purity 96%) in methanol as an internal standard. A 2 μL aliquot of the extracted 
supernatant was injected onto a Shimadzu LC-20ADXR high performance liquid 
chromatography system via a LEAP CTC PAL autosampler. The LC separation was 
performed using a Waters XBridge BEH C18 LC column (2.5 μm, 75 mm × 2.1 mm) 
maintained at 60 °C with gradient elution at a flow rate of 0.35 mL/min. The binary mobile 
phase consisted of ultra-pure water - 100 mM ammonium formate, pH=3.0 – methanol 
(850:50:100 v/v) in reservoir A and methanol – acetonitrile – 100 mM ammonium formate, 
pH=3.0 (475:475:50 v/v) in reservoir B. The initial mobile phase consisted of 42.5% B and 
was maintained for 1.6 minutes. The column was then rinsed for 1.4 minutes at 100% B and 
then equilibrated at the initial conditions for 2 minutes for a total run time of 5 minutes. 
Under these conditions, the analyte and IS eluted at 0.85 and 0.83 minutes, respectively.
Analyte and IS were detected with tandem mass spectrometry using a SCIEX API 5500 Q-
TRAP in the positive ESI mode with monitoring of the following mass transitions: 
panobinostat 350.18 −> 158.18, panobinostat-d8 357.91 −> 147.19. The experimental 
bioanalytical runs were all found to be acceptable for the purpose of a singlicate non-GLP, 
preclinical PK assessment. A linear model (1/X2 weighting) fit the calibrators across the 5 to 
1000 ng/mL range, with a correlation coefficient (R) of ≥0.99. The lower limit of 
quantitation (LLOQ), defined as a peak area signal-to-noise ratio of 5 or greater verses a 
matrix blank with IS, was 5 ng/mL for plasma and 30 ng/mL for tissues due to the dilution 
factor. The intra-run precision and accuracy was < 0.312% CV and 99.4% to 113%, 
respectively for plasma, brain, retina, and vitreous. Tumor matrix demonstrated less-
favorable precision and accuracy, with values of < 1.79% CV and 108% to 119%, 
respectively. The resultant panobinostat concentration-time (Ct) data were grouped by 
matrix and time point, and manual imputation of data below the lower limit of quantitation

elimination rate constant (Ke) was estimated using an unweighted log-linear regression of 
the terminal phase. The terminal elimination half-life (T1/2) was estimated as 0.693/Ke, and 
the AUC from time 0 to infinity (AUCinf) was estimated as the AUC to the last time point

(Clast), time of Clast (Tlast), apparent clearance (CL/F = Dose/AUCinf), and apparent 
terminal volume of distribution (Vz/F). The average concentration over a dosing interval 
(Cavg) was estimated as AUCinf/dosing interval in hours. The apparent partition coefficient 
of panobinostat from the plasma to the tissue of interest (Kp,tissue) was estimated as the 
ratio of the AUCinf, tissue to AUCinf plasma when available. To estimate a clinically 
relevant mouse dosage, the resultant mouse plasma AUCinf and Cavg was compared with 
the reported human plasma PK values at the putative single agent panobinostat maximum 
tolerated dose or the FDA-approved dose. All inferences were made under the assumption of 
time-independent, linear and dose-proportional PK in mice and humans.
Preclinical testing
(Preclinical Phase I) Non-tumor bearing athymic nude mice were used for tolerability testing 
of the following combinations: VCR + IRN, AZD1775 + VCR + IRN, and panobinostat + 
bortezomib. Mice were given 4 cycles of chemotherapy with 21 days per cycle. The 
chemotherapeutic drug combinations and schedule used were designed to mimic potential 
human clinical trials. Each treatment group contained 3 mice. Vincristine was dosed by 
intraperitoneal injection once a week on days 1, 8, and 15. Irinotecan was dosed by 
intraperitoneal injection once daily on days 1–5 and 8–12. AZD1775 was dosed by oral 
gavage twice daily on days 1–5. Panobinostat was dosed by intraperitoneal injection once 
daily on days 1, 3, 5, 8, 10 and 12. Bortezomib was dosed by intraperitoneal injection once 
daily on days 1, 4, 8 and 11. Mouse weight and standard complete blood counts were 
monitored for each treatment group. The health of the animals was monitored daily 
throughout therapy. (Preclinical Phase II) RMS orthotopic xenografts were created by 
injecting luciferase labeled cells from SJRHB000026_X1 (ERMS), SJRHB012_Y (ERMS), 
and SJRHB013759_X1 (ARMS) into recipient CD-1 nude mice using the intramuscular 
injection technique previously described. Mice were screened weekly by Xenogen and the 
bioluminescence was measured. Mice were enrolled in the study after achieving a target 
bioluminescence signal of 106 –107 photons/sec/cm2 or greater for 2 weeks or a palpable 
tumor, and chemotherapy was started the following Monday. The following preclinical phase 
II trials were performed (Table S10):
SJRHB000026_X1 (ERMS)—Mice were randomized to 6 treatment groups: AZD1775 + 
VCR + IRN, AZD1775 + IRN, VCR + IRN, panobinostat + bortezomib, IRN alone, and 
placebo. The dose of AZD1775 was 60 mg/kg oral gavage twice daily for days 1–5. IRN 
was 1.25 mg/kg intraperitoneal once daily on days 1–5 and 8–12. Vincristine was 
administered at 0.38 mg/kg intraperitoneal once daily on days 1,3,5,8,10 and 12. Bortezomib 
was administered at 1 mg/kg intraperitoneal once daily on days 1,4,8 and 11. Mice received 
4 courses of chemotherapy (3 weeks per course) and bioluminescence was monitored 
weekly and at the end of therapy. Disease response was classified according to

 bioluminescence signal. Mice with a signal of 105 photons/sec/cm2 or less (similar to 
background) were classified as complete response, 105–106 photons/sec/cm2 as partial 
response, 107 up to 108 photons/sec/cm2 (similar to enrollment signal) as stable disease, and 
greater than 108 photons/sec/cm2 as progressive disease. Mice with tumor burden at any 
time greater than 20% of body weight were also classified as progressive disease. Mice were 
monitored daily while receiving chemotherapy.
SJRHB012_Y (ERMS)
AZD1775 groups and panobinostat + bortezomib groups were tested in 2 separate phase II 
preclinical trials. In the first trial, mice were randomized to 4 treatment groups: AZD1775 + 
VCR + IRN (low dose protracted schedule), AZD1775 + VCR + IRN (standard 5 day 
schedule), VCR + IRN (low dose protracted schedule), and placebo. The second trial 
randomly enrolled mice into 2 treatment groups, panobinostat + bortezomib, and placebo. 
The dose of AZD1775 was 60 mg/kg oral gavage twice daily for days 1–5. IRN was 1.25 
mg/kg intraperitoneal once daily on days 1–5 and 8–12. Another regimen of IRN was also 
used in these mice at 3.125 mg/kg intraperitoneal once daily on days 1–5. These represent 
the two most commonly used schedules in children in the clinic.Vincristine was 
administered at 0.38 mg/kg intraperitoneal once daily on days 1,3,5,8,10 and 12. Bortezomib 
was administered at 1 mg/kg intraperitoneal once daily on days 1,4,8 and 11. Mice received 
6 courses of chemotherapy and bioluminescence was monitored weekly in the first trial and 
with each course (every 3 weeks) in the second trial. Disease response was classified 
according to bioluminescence signal. Mice with a signal of 105 photons/sec/cm2 or less 
(similar to background) were classified as complete response, 105–106 photons/sec/cm2 as 
partial response, 107 up to 108 photons/sec/cm2 (similar to enrollment signal) as stable 
disease, and greater than 108 photons/sec/cm2 as progressive disease. Mice with tumor 
burden at any time greater than 20% of body weight were also classified as progressive 
disease. Mice were monitored daily while receiving chemotherapy.

preclinical trials. In the first trial, mice were randomized to 3 treatment groups: AZD1775 + 
VCR + IRN (low dose protracted schedule), VCR + IRN (low dose protracted schedule), and 
placebo. The second trial randomly enrolled mice into 2 treatment groups, panobinostat + 
bortezomib, and placebo. The dose of AZD1775 was 60 mg/kg oral gavage twice daily for 
days 1–5. IRN was 1.25 mg/kg intraperitoneal once daily on days 1–5 and 8–12. Vincristine 
was administered at 0.38 mg/kg intraperitoneal once daily on days 1,3,5,8,10 and 12. 
Bortezomib was administered at 1 mg/kg intraperitoneal once daily on days 1,4,8 and 11. 
Mice received 6 courses of chemotherapy and bioluminescence was monitored weekly in the 
first trial and with each course (every 3 weeks) in the second trial. Disease response was 
classified according to bioluminescence signal. Mice with a signal of 105 photons/sec/cm2 or 
less (similar to background) were classified as complete response, 105–106 photons/sec/cm2 
as partial response, 107 up to 108 photons/sec/cm2 (similar to enrollment signal) as stable 
disease, and greater than 108 photons/sec/cm2 as progressive disease. Mice with tumor 
burden at any time greater than 20% of body weight were also classified as progressive 
disease. Mice were monitored daily while receiving chemotherapy.

 (Preclinical Phase III) We performed a randomized, double-blind placebo controlled 
preclinical phase III trial using 140 mice from 4 different O-PDX lines. RMS orthotopic 
xenografts were created by injecting luciferase labeled cells from SJRHB000026_X1 
(ERMS), SJRHB012_Y (ERMS), SJRHB013757_X2 (ARMS) and SJRHB013759_X1 
(ARMS) into recipient athymic nude mice using the intramuscular injection technique 
previously described. Mice were screened weekly by Xenogen and the bioluminescence was 
measured. Mice were enrolled in the study after achieving a target bioluminescence signal of 
106 –107 photons/sec/cm2 or greater for 2 weeks or a palpable tumor, and chemotherapy was 
started the following Monday. Individuals giving the chemotherapy as well as those doing 
the bioluminescence imaging were blinded to the drugs being administered as well as the 
specific O-PDX tumor line. The following drugs and doses were used in the preclinical 
phase III trial based off AUC-guided dosing obtained from pharmacokinetic studies matched 
to human doses that are clinically relevant in patients. The dose of AZD1775 was 48 mg/kg 
oral gavage twice daily for days 1–5. IRN was 1.25 mg/kg intraperitoneal once daily on days 
1–5 and 8–12. Vincristine was administered at 0.38 mg/kg intraperitoneal once daily on days 
1,3,5,8,10 and 12. Mice received 6 courses of chemotherapy (3 weeks per course) and 
bioluminescence was monitored on week 3 of each course and at the end of therapy. Disease 
response was classified according to bioluminescence signal as above. AZD1775 was 
reconstituted in 0.5% methylcellulose, IRN and VCR in sterile normal saline, panobinostat 
in 5% dextrose with sterile water (D5W) and bortezomib in 2% DMSO/98% sterile normal 
saline.
Xenogen imaging and quantification
Mice were given intraperitoneal injections of Firefly D-Luciferin (Caliper Life Sciences 3 
mg/mouse). Bioluminescent images were taken five minutes later using the IVIS® 200 
imaging system. Anesthesia was administered throughout image acquisition (isoflurane 
1.5% in O2 delivered at 2 liters/min). The Living Image 4.3 software (Caliper Life Sciences) 
was used to generate a standard region of interest (ROI) encompassing the largest tumor at 
maximal bioluminescence signal. The identical ROI was used to determine the average 
radiance (photons/s/cm2/sr) for all xenografts.
