Inherited and age-related retinal degenerative diseases cause progressive loss of rod and
cone photoreceptors, leading to blindness, but spare downstream retinal neurons, which can
be targeted for optogenetic therapy. However, optogenetic approaches have been limited by
either low light sensitivity or slow kinetics, and lack adaptation to changes in ambient light,
and not been shown to restore object vision. We find that the vertebrate medium wavelength
cone opsin (MW-opsin) overcomes these limitations and supports vision in dim light. MW-
opsin enables an otherwise blind retinitis pigmenotosa mouse to discriminate temporal and
spatial light patterns displayed on a standard LCD computer tablet, displays adaption to
changes in ambient light, and restores open-field novel object exploration under incidental
room light. By contrast, rhodopsin, which is similar in sensitivity but slower in light response
and has greater rundown, fails these tests. Thus, MW-opsin provides the speed, sensitivity
and adaptation needed to restore patterned vision.

nherited retinal diseases (IRDs) lead to the progressive loss of
rods and cones, beginning in the peripheral retina and
underlie blindness in children and adults into middle age1.
Age-related macular degeneration (AMD), the leading cause of
severe vision loss in people over 50 years of age, also results from
loss of photoreceptor cells, but in the central retina, impairing
highest acuity vision2. IRDs can result from defects in >50
genes3,4, and there are no clear single gene defects that cause
AMD5, making gene replacement costly or ineffective. Further-
more, gene replacement can slow progression but does not help in
late stage disease.
An alternative approach is to endow light sensitivity to
downstream neurons of the inner retina that survive following
photoreceptor loss6,7, either with synthetic photoswitches, which
actuate native ion channels8–12, or by genetic introduction of a
light-sensitive signaling protein. A number of light-sensitive sig-
naling proteins have been tested, including two microbial opsins,
the ion channel channelrhodopsin and ion pump halorho-
dopsin13–18, chemically engineered mammalian receptors19,20
and two G-protein coupled receptor (GPCR) opsins that are
native to the retina, rhodopsin of rod photoreceptor cells and
melanopsin of intrinsically photosensitive retinal ganglion cells21–
25. These light-gated systems, when delivered to the surviving
neurons of the blind retina using adeno-associated viruses
(AAVs), restore light sensitivity, transmission of light-driven
activity to higher order visual centers in the brain, and both
innate and learned visually guided behaviors. However, each of
these
approaches
encounters
a
significant
limitation.
The
microbial opsins and the chemically engineered receptors have
fast kinetics (~50–200 ms) and follow high frequency modulation
of light (~20 Hz) but have a low sensitivity to light (requiring
intensities of very bright outdoor light). The sensitivity is so low
that a clinical trial for channelrhodopsin requires intensifying
goggles26,27, risking retinal photo-toxicity28,29. In contrast, ecto-
pic expression of rhodopsin and melanopsin are extremely sen-
sitive to light (responding to indoor light), but so slow (seconds to
tens of seconds)21–24 that they may not support patterned vision
given eye motion and movement of the subject and of visual
objects. Moreover, the systems tested to date operate over a
relatively narrow range of intensities. In contrast, normal pho-
toreception combines speed with high sensitivity and adaptation
that permits a sharp intensity-response curve to shift over 9
orders of magnitude. The sensitivity and adaptation emerge from
the properties of G-protein signaling pathway of photoreceptor
cells that both amplifies and modulates the light response. Our
goal was to overcome the shortcomings of current vision
restoration approaches by searching for a GPCR that could
provide fast, sensitive and adapting light responses to surviving
cells of the blind retina.
Cone opsins are G-protein coupled receptors of cone outer
segments in the vertebrate retina. Like the rhodopsin of rods,
cone opsins are highly sensitive and adapt to light over many
orders of magnitude. While rods dominate the periphery of the
retina and play a major role in vision under low light conditions,
cones are densely arrayed in the fovea, where they mediate high
acuity central vision, in both indoor and outdoor light.
We find that, when virally delivered to retinal ganglion cells
(RGCs), medium wavelength cone opsin (MW-opsin) is as sensitive
to light as rhodopsin under physiological stimulation parameters,
but displays 10-fold faster kinetics. MW-opsin restores dis-
crimination between flashing and constant light and between line
patterns of different orientation, in both static and moving displays
on a standard LCD computer screen. Rhodopsin under the same
behavioral parameters performed no better than blind animals.
To date, adaptive goggles have been used to make an optoge-
netic prosthetic operate under natural conditions of changing
ambient light levels. Strikingly, the light response of MW-opsin in
RGCs itself adapts to ambient light, and does so over a con-
siderable range, normalizing to background luminance. This
“built-in” adaptation expands visual function across naturally
encountered variations in lighting, from indoor to outdoor light.
Although optogenetic and chemical therapies for vision
restoration for photoreceptor degenerative disease have been
under development for more than a decade, none has yet been
shown to restore object vision. We find that novel object
exploration in an open field environment, under conditions that
depend on vision, is restored by MW-opsin, indicating that
restoration of object vision under natural light. Thus, MW-opsin
provides a unique combination of speed, sensitivity, and lumi-
nance adaptation and restores key aspects of natural vision. MW-
opsin therefore represents a promising new biological prosthetic
for patients suffering from degenerative retinal disease.
Results
MW-opsin restores fast and sensitive light responses. Recent
studies have established that vertebrate rhodopsin, found in rod
outer segments, may be used ectopically to control G-coupled
signaling in cultured cells, RGCs and ON bipolar cells, but runs
down with repeated stimulation and deactivates slowly30,31,21,22,
raising concern that it may not support vision of natural scenes
because of movement of the observer and surrounding objects or
saturation and possibly photo-bleaching of the chromophore
under photopic lighting conditions. We wondered if another
vertebrate opsin would have faster kinetics while maintaining
similar light-sensitivity to rhodopsin. We turned to a mammalian
cone opsin, MW-opsin, whose activation of the tetrameric GIRK1
(F137S) G protein-coupled inward-rectifier potassium channel in
HEK293 cells we found to decay 8-fold more rapidly and recover
more completely than rhodopsin (Fig. 1a–c).
We tested MW-opsin in the retina of the rd1 mouse, which
has a mutation in the PDE-6-β gene, resulting in progressive
loss of rod and cone photoreceptor cells. MW-opsin under
control of the human synapsin promoter (hSyn-1), with a yellow
fluorescent (YFP) C-terminal tag for tracking expression, was
packaged in AAV2/2(4YF) and injected intravitreally at post-
natal day 45–60 (Fig. 1d, e). Retinas isolated 4–8 weeks later
showed expression to be pan-retinal, with a transfection rate of
45 ± 19% (SD) and localized to the soma and dendritic layers of
ON-RGCs and OFF-RGCs (Fig. 1f, g and Supplementary Fig. 1),
consistent with previous studies32 and similar to expression of
rhodopsin under identical parameters (Supplementary Fig. 2).
Retinas were mounted on a multi-electrode array (MEA), with
the RGC layer in contact with the electrodes, to test for light-
evoked activity. Due to complete photoreceptor degeneration in
animals
≥3-months-old33,
no
light-evoked
response
was
detected in the retina of control rd1 littermates (Fig. 1h), with
the exception of a few RGCs which displayed slow responses
characteristic of intrinsically photosensitive RGCs34. In con-
trast, retinas from MW-opsin rd1 animals displayed robust
light-evoked increases in firing rate, consisting of a large fast,
transient
component
and
a
small
(~30%
in
size)
slow
component (Fig. 2a, Supplementary Fig. 3). Responses across
retina were normalized using the Light Response Index (LRI =
(peak firing rate in the light—average firing rate in dark)/peak
firing rate in the light + average firing rate in dark)) adopted
from Tochitsky and colleagues11 and our earlier work20. The
light
responses
ran
down
with
repeated
bouts
of
light
stimulation, as expected following removal of the retinal
pigment epithelium, a source of 11-cis-retinal. The run down
was reduced by the addition of 9-cis-retinal (a stable analog of
11-cis-retinal) to the recording solution (Fig. 1j).

 MW-opsin rd1 mouse retinas were highly sensitive to light, to a
degree similar to rhodopsin (Fig. 2b, c), in the range of indoor
light intensity, and ~1000-fold higher than channelrhodopsin13,18
and halorhodopsin16,17 (Supplementary Fig. 4). While similar in
sensitivity to rhodopsin (Supplementary Fig. 5a) MW-opsin ran
down less in response to repeated flashes (Supplementary Fig. 5b)
and had faster kinetics: ~5-fold faster rise, ~3-fold shorter time to
peak and ~7-fold faster decay following a light pulse (Fig. 2d, e).
The time constant of rise, the time to peak, and the time constant
of decay changed modestly with decreasing light intensities,
maintaining the advantage in speed over most of the intensity
range (Supplementary Fig. 5c–e)21,22. The rise and decay kinetics
of the response in RGCs of rd1 retina expressing MW-opsin
resembled those of the RGC transient ON-response seen in wt
retina, except that the former had a longer latency (Fig. 2e and
Supplementary Fig. 5f, g). The fast response kinetics and
sensitivity of MW-opsin suggested that it would respond to brief
flashes of light. Indeed, illumination pulses as short as 25 ms,
triggered responses that were ~50% of the maximal peak response
(Fig. 2f, g), similar to what is seen in wt retina35.
We examined contrast sensitivity in the excised retina and in
primary visual cortex in vivo by measuring responses to full-field
gray scale steps. In the excised rd1 retina expressing MW-opsin,
RGC activity changed in response to changes in brightness of as
little as 25% (Supplementary Fig. 6a, b), approaching but not
equivalent to the contrast sensitivity of the wild type retina
(Supplementary Fig. 6c). In complementary in vivo experiments
on rd1 animals expressing MW-opsin in RGCs, we measured
single unit responses and visually evoked potentials across the
layers of primary visual cortex in awake, free running animals
(Supplementary Fig. 7) and observed similar contrast sensitivity
using a standard computer monitor (Supplementary Fig. 8). The
cortical responses followed flash frequencies up to at least 4 Hz
(Supplementary Fig. 9). The sensitivity and kinetics of the light
responses imparted by MW-opsin in RGCs suggested that it may
support visually guided behavior.
MW-opsin restores innate light avoidance. Sighted mice
innately avoid illuminated areas, a survival mechanism to evade
capture36 that is lost following photoreceptor degeneration in rd1

 mice14,23. To determine if this behavior could be restored, rd1
mice expressing MW-opsin were tested in a behavior box con-
sisting of adjoining light and dark compartments (Fig. 3a). The
fraction of time spent in each compartment was recorded and
compared to untreated rd1 and wt mice (Fig. 3b, Supplementary
Fig. 10a–c, Supplementary Table 1). The light compartment was
illuminated with low intensity white light, equivalent to indoor
office lighting (100 μW cm−2). Untreated rd1 mice spent ~45% of
the time in the dark compartment, reflecting a slight location bias
in favor of the release compartment (see Supplementary Meth-
ods) (Fig. 3b). In contrast, rd1 mice expressing either rhodopsin
or MW-opsin showed a strong preference for the dark com-
partment (~70%), similar to normally sighted wt animals (80%)
(Fig. 3b and Supplementary Fig. 10a). When white light was
replaced with blue (460 ± 22 nm) or green (535 ± 25 nm) light
and the intensity that was reduced to a lower end of the isolated
retina intensity-response curves for MW-opsin and rhodopsin
(1 μW cm−2; Fig. 2b) both MW-opsin and rhodopsin expressing
animals showed green light avoidance (Fig. 3c, left and Supple-
mentary Fig. 10b), but only rhodopsin animals showed blue light-
avoidance (Fig. 3c, right and Supplementary Fig. 10c), consistent
with their absorption spectra37.
MW-opsin supports temporal light pattern discrimination. We
used a visually cued fear-conditioning paradigm to test the ability
of animals to differentiate flashing from constant light. We used a
single compartment behavioral apparatus with a low intensity

 (100 μW cm−2) LED light that switched between constant and
flashing (2 Hz) light. For each animal, either constant or flashing
light was paired with a mild foot shock for 2 days (Fig. 3d) and
freezing time was measured on day 3 in response to light cues in
absence of foot shock11,22,38. Freezing time in this “paired group”
was compared to that of an “unpaired group,” in which training
shocks were randomized (i.e., not paired consistently with a visual
cue). Freezing times in untreated rd1 mice did not differ between
paired and unpaired conditions, consistent with the inability to
see the visual cues (Fig. 3e, gray). In contrast, rd1 mice expressing
MW-opsin froze more in the paired condition, as observed in wt
animals (Fig. 3e, green and white). Strikingly, rd1 mice expressing
rhodopsin did not differ between paired and unpaired conditions
(Fig. 3e, blue). This suggests that, unlike blind mice expressing
MW-cone opsin, rhodopsin mice cannot discriminate light
flashing at 2-Hz from constant light, consistent with the slow
light response kinetics observed in MEA (Fig. 2e)
MW-opsin restores spatial pattern discrimination. We asked if
MW-opsin in RGCs would enable rd1 mice to detect spatial light
patterns. We used a behavioral chamber with two adjoining
compartments (Fig. 3f), each with a low-intensity LCD tablet
(iPad) mounted on a wall that displayed a pair of parallel lines: in
one, the lines were oriented vertically (||) and in the other hor-
izontally (=). For MW-opsin the wavelength was centered at
535 nm (520–560) and for rhodopsin at 497 nm (480–520). On
day 1, mice were habituated to the compartments with the visual
displays off. During a 2-day training period, an aversive foot
shock was paired with either the vertical or horizontal lines
(Supplementary Fig. 10d). On day 4 the locations of the stimuli
were switched to avoid location bias and conditioned avoidance
was tested. We found that rd1 animals expressing MW-opsin
showed avoidance of the aversive visual cue at a level significantly
higher than did untreated rd1 controls, and similar to wt mice
(Fig. 3g and Supplementary Fig. 10e). Rd1 animals expressing
rhodopsin behaved like the blind untreated rd1 controls. These
results indicate that MW-opsin restores the ability to recognize
spatial light patterns, but rhodopsin does not.
We next asked if mice could discriminate differences between
lines of identical orientation but different spacing, a visual task
adopted from tests of visual acuity in humans and animals39,40.
Parallel vertical lines were separated by distances of 1 or 6 cm. As
above, an aversive foot shock was paired with one of the stimuli
during the training period on days 2 and 3, and recall was tested
on day 4. We found that rd1 mice expressing MW-opsin are able
to distinguish between the two patterns with a performance that
is similar to that of wt mice, whereas rhodopsin expressing
animals are similar to untreated rd1 mice (Fig. 3h. Supplementary
Figs. 10f and 12). MW-opsin also supported line differentiation
when the parallel lines were in motion (1 cm/s) (Fig. 3i and
Supplementary Fig. 10g).
Light adaptation of MW-opsin response and visual function. A
fundamental characteristic of vision is the ability to distinguish
objects across a wide range of ambient light intensities41,42. We
wondered whether some aspect of adaptation would operate in
the rd1 retina expressing MW-opsin. Isolated retinas were kept in
complete darkness for 15 min (dark-adapted) and then tested in a
series of brief (100 ms) flashes of green light (535 + 25 nm) at
60-s intervals and over a range of intensities. Retinas were then
adapted for 5 min to a moderate indoor light level (light-adapted;
white light at 100 μW cm−2) and retested. We first examined the
kinetics of the light responses. The light response decayed rapidly,
as shown above, displaying similar response kinetics for both the
light and dark-adapted retina (Fig. 4a Supplementary Fig. 12a, b).
The intensity-response curve showed a high light sensitivity in the
dark-adapted
retina
(responding
at
~0.5 μW cm−2)
and
lower sensitivity after adaptation to moderate light (responding to
~200 μW cm−2) (Fig. 4b, c and Supplementary Fig. 12a, b). This
adaptation represented a shift by 2–3 orders of magnitude on the
intensity axis (321 + 89, N = 3) (Fig. 4b, c).
We
asked
if
MW-opsin
would
provide
visually
useful
light adaptation in the behaving animal, first in the context of
light avoidance behavior. Rd1 mice expressing MW-opsin were
either dark adapted or light adapted to bright indoor illumination
for 1 h (white light, 1 mW cm−2/535 nm light component,
50 μW cm−2) (Fig. 4d). They were then tested immediately in
the two-chamber light-dark box for light avoidance at either
1 μW cm−2 (dim) or 100 μW cm−2 (bright). The light adapted
MW-opsin expressing rd1 mice showed stronger light avoidance
with the brighter test light, whereas the dim test light produced a
high level of light avoidance in the dark-adapted animals (Fig. 4e
and Supplementary Fig. 12c). Pattern recognition was also
influenced by light adaptation. Rd1 mice expressing MW-opsin
were trained by pairing mild foot shock with a display of parallel
lines at one of two spacing, similar to that described above
(Fig. 3h and Supplementary Fig. 10d). They were then dark-
adapted (1 h) or light-adapted (1, 4 or 8 h) before testing. We
found that the dark-adapted animals were able to discriminate
between the line patterns whether they were presented at the low
(0.25 μW cm−2) or moderate (10 μW cm−2) indoor intensity
(Fig. 4f and Supplementary Fig. 12d), but that light-adapted
animals only succeeded with the brighter test line patterns and
were identical in performance between the groups that were light
adapted for 1, 4, and 8 h (Fig. 4f and Supplementary Fig. 12e).
The results show that spatial pattern recognition mediated by
MW-opsin is adaptive over a range of natural light intensities.
MW-opsin restores novel object exploration. Our experiments
above show that MW-opsin enables pattern recognition across a
wide range of light intensities using illuminated displays. We
wondered how it would operate in a natural environment, where
ambient, incidental light illuminates three-dimensional objects.
To address this, we employed an open field arena that is com-
monly used to test novel object recognition and exploratory
behavior43,44. Mice naturally avoid open spaces and maintain
proximity to walls of their environment. Exploratory excursions
from these places of safety can be motivated by novel stimuli.
Although mice employ multiple sensory modalities during
exploration, vision has been shown to be critical for spatial
navigation45. Our arena consisted of a cube containing two dis-
tinct novel objects. The mouse was placed against the arena wall,
far enough from the objects, which themselves were far enough
apart, so that the chance of an accidental encounter was low
whether the animal walked along the wall or explored the other
object. We filmed rd1 untreated, rd1-sham injected, rd1 expres-
sing rhodopsin or rd1 expressing MW-opsin mice, as well as wt
animals. Their movements were tracked for 10 min the first time
that they were placed into the arena (Fig. 5a–d). We found that wt
animals travel 1.6-fold farther and moved at an average velocity
1.59-fold faster than blind rd1 animals, consistent with the known
visual component of exploratory behavior. Strikingly, like wt
animals, rd1 animals expressing MW-opsin traveled farther (by
1.42-fold) and faster (by 1.41-fold) than their untreated rd1 lit-
termates (Fig. 5e, f), suggesting that MW-opsin supports normal
novel object exploration. To analyze this further, we focused on
aspects of exploratory behavior that most likely depend on vision
at a distance; the latency to exploration of the novel objects and
the velocity and distance traveled on the excursions to the objects.

 similarly to untreated rd1 animals, but MW-opsin mice reached
the first and second objects in 5.12-fold and 4.25-fold shorter
times, respectively (Fig. 5g, h), moved at velocities that were 2.2-
fold and 1.89-fold faster to the first and second objects, respec-
tively (Fig. 5i, j), and took shorter pathways that were 0.60-fold
and 0.55-fold the distance to the first and second objects,
respectively (Fig. 5k, l), as compared to untreated rd1 mice. In
each of these measures, MW-opsin expressing rd1 mice reached
levels that were similar to those of wt animals (Fig. 5e–l). These
results suggest that MW-opsin in RGCs provides previously blind
animals with naturalistic vision of objects under ambient light.
Discussion
Until now, optogenetic tools for vision restoration have had one
of two significant shortcomings. The microbial opsins, chan-
nelrhodopsin and halorhodopsin15–18,46, and the light-engineered
mammalian receptors20,47 respond rapidly to light (in milli-
seconds) and so should support “refresh rates” of sufficient speed
for vision in motion, but they require such intense light as to risk
damage to the retina. Conversely, the opsins from rods and
intrinsically photosensitive RGCs—rhodopsin and melanopsin—
are sufficiently sensitive to enable function in dim room light, but
are very slow (hundreds of milliseconds to tens of seconds)21–24;
slow enough to raise the concern that patterned vision may not be
possible, as indeed we show here in tests of visual pattern
recognition.
We find that MW-opsin expressed in RGCs of blind rd1 mice
overcome these shortcomings, providing the combined speed and
sensitivity to enable both static and moving pattern recognition in
dim light. We also find that a key property of practical vision,
light adaptation, is provided by MW-opsin. This adaptation
covers 2–3 orders of magnitude, from dim room light to outdoor
light. Finally, MW-opsin does more than support the recognition

 of abstract line patterns displayed on an LCD computer screen, it
restores visually guided exploration of novel objects under normal
incidental room light. The combination of sensitivity, speed and
adaptation, the reduced risk of immune reaction due to use of a
native retinal protein, and the restoration of patterned vision
make MW-opsin unique among methods for restoring vision.
Cone opsins are found in the cone photoreceptor cells of the
retina and are responsible for color vision under photopic light
conditions. The cone photoreceptors dominate our central
(foveal) vision and are responsible for fine visual acuity of the
fixating eye. There are three classes of cone opsins in humans:
short-wavelength, medium-wavelength, and long-wavelength,
corresponding to different absorption maxima and covering dif-
ferent parts of the visible spectrum. Like rhodopsin found in rod
photoreceptors, the cone opsins are GPCRs that use isomerization
of the chromophore 11-cis-retinal to induce conformational
changes leading to activation of a second messenger cascade that
results in the gating of downstream effector ion channels.
In their native photoreceptor cell environment, the cone opsins
differ from rhodopsin in a number of ways: they regenerate more
rapidly from opsin and 11-cis retinal following bleaching, have
faster thermal isomerization, and are faster in the formation and
decay of functional pigment intermediates such as meta II48–52.
The question is whether these differences reflect an environment
unique to rods and cones and if the differences would remain if
the opsin were moved to another cell type in the retina, where its
G protein, regulatory systems, effectors and other specialized
subcellular signaling complex, may be unfamiliar or absent. As
shown earlier for short and long wave cone opsins31, we find that
MW-opsin expressed in HEK cells activate GIRK channels more
rapidly than rhodopsin, suggesting that the higher speed reflects
an intrinsic property of the cone opsin. But would this translate
into more rapid signaling in RGCs? When MW-opsin and rho-
dopsin are individually expressed in rd1 mouse retina under
identical conditions, both the on and off kinetics of excitation are
faster in MW-opsin, with a combined effect of a ~10-fold faster

 signaling speed. However, the MW-opsin response of RGCs is
delayed compared the natural ON-response of wt retina. Never-
theless, at moderate light intensity, MW-opsin responds to a flash
of light as brief as 25 ms. We conjecture that the higher speed
enabled rd1 mice expressing MW-opsin to distinguish flashing
from steady light, as well as wt animals, while rd1 mice expressing
the slower rhodopsin were unsuccessful. Modifications that
reduce
the
delay
to
the
response
may
further
improve
performance.
We find that MW-opsin expressed in RGCs is highly light
sensitive, similar to the other opsins of the mammalian retina,
rhodopsin, and melanopsin21–24 and are able to operate in nor-
mal room light. In contrast, microbial channelrhodopsin and
halorhodopsin are 1000–10,000-fold less sensitive16,17. This
insensitivity can be overcome by intensifying goggles, however,
this brings the retinal illumination very close to the safety
threshold determined by the European Commission guidelines
for limited exposure of artificial optical radiation in patients53.
Improved microbial opsins have been shown to have enhanced
sensitivity18,54 and may reduce this problem in the retina, but do
not appear to increase sensitivity to the level of intrinsic photo-
receptors like that achieved by the ectopic expression of verte-
brate opsins of the retina.
Prior purely optogenetic approaches have been shown to
restore light-evoked activity in visual cortex15,22, the pupillary
reflex9,23,47, the ability of behaving animals to discriminate con-
stant light from constant dark9,11,14,20,22,23,46,47 and a fright
response to a looming cue21, but two-dimensional pattern
recognition of the kind needed for patterned vision has not been
demonstrated, nor has vision of natural objects. We designed two
sets of behavioral tests, the first to determine whether rd1 mice
regain
the
ability
to
distinguish
between
different
two-
dimensional spatial patterns and the second to determine if
they regain the ability to distinguish between different three-
dimensional natural objects.
To assess visual recognition of two-dimensional line patterns,
we took advantage of the high sensitivity to light of MW-opsin
and rhodopsin to display line patterns as visual cues on standard
LCD screens. We used an active avoidance task to test the ability
of animals to discriminate between patterns of different spatial
arrangement and orientation. Rd1 mice expressing MW-opsin
performed, as well as normally sighted wt mice with intact rods
and cones in distinguishing static parallel lines of vertical versus
horizontal orientation. In stark contrast, rd1 mice expressing
rhodopsin were unable to perform this static orientation task. We
conjecture that, even when the image is still, saccadic movement
of the mouse eye or head blurs the image beyond recognition
because of the slow refresh kinetics of rhodopsin. An acuity
discrimination task in which mice must distinguish between lines
separated
by
different
distances
revealed
that
MW-opsin
expressing rd1 mice perform, as well as wt mice, even when the
bars are in motion. Accounting for distance from the point of
decision and the dimensions of our patterned stimuli, this
amounts to a discrimination of ~18° and 0.056 cycles per degree
(Supplementary Methods), ~9-fold lower than the resolution of
visually intact wt mice (~0.3–0.5cpd) reported in earlier beha-
vioral studies40,55–57.
To assess three-dimensional object vision, we used in an open-
field behavior, where mice naturally explore novel objects under
normal incidental room light, and where distance to the objects
dictates that the major determinant in the behavior is vision. Each
of the behavioral measures that were found to depend on vision,
i.e., to differ between sighted wt animals and blind rd1 animals
(total distance traveled, average velocity of exploration, latency to
reach the object, velocity of trajectory to the object, and distance
traveled to reach the object) were restored in previously blind rd1
animals to wt levels. This suggests that MW-opsin in RGCs
restores the visual recognition that objects are novel.
Vertebrate vision operates over a very wide range of intensities
by mechanisms of adaptation to ambient light58. Photoreceptor
adaptation is achieved via two main mechanisms: (1) dynamic
desensitization of the opsin’s G-protein signaling cascade and (2)
partial bleaching of retinal pigment during illumination, allowing
the fraction of opsin that is sensitive to light to be titrated by
ambient light59,60. Replenishment is presumably supplied by the
retinal pigment epithelium (RPE) or by Müller glia cells located in
close proximity to the RGCs and were recently found to contain
vitamin A isomerase activity61. It seems unlikely that dynamic
desensitization would transfer to RGCs with a cone opsin, since
nodes of control that mediate light adaptation in the G-protein
signaling cascade may be specialized to the photoreceptor cells.
We asked whether the light response mediated by MW-opsin in
RGCs would adapt to ambient light levels. We found that the
light response of the isolated rd1 retina expressing MW-opsin
shifts in sensitivity by >100-fold when changing from dark to
light adaptation. The maximal peak response was maintained,
meaning that the signal to noise is preserved as the intensity curve
shifts from dim indoor to moderate outdoor light levels. Impor-
tantly, the light adaptation participated usefully in the behaving
animal in a learned visual discrimination task of spatial pattern
recognition. The substantial adaptation shift in sensitivity, which,
among optogenetic systems for vision restoration, is thus far
unique, suggests that MW-opsin could provide patients with a
dynamically adjusted vision restoration for indoor and outdoor
environments.
The high sensitivity of MW-opsin solves a major challenge of
optogenetic gene therapy by eliminating the need for the light
intensifying goggles currently used in clinical trials and, therefore,
concern about photo-damage to the surviving retina. Compared
to the microbial opsins or foreign molecules, restoration in
patients using gene delivery of native protein such as MW-opsin
reduces the risk of immune reaction or the subsequent need for
localized or systemic immune suppression. Remarkably, the
vision mediated by MW-opsin displays light adaptation over a
range that is suited to vision at both indoor and outdoor light
levels. Off-the-shelf adjusting sunglasses could provide a simple
solution to expand operation to bright outdoor light. A retinal
prosthetic that recapitulates aspects of natural photoreceptor-
derived vision in terms of sensitivity, speed and capacity for light
adaptation may complement remaining fragments of natural
vision in cases of partial, localized, or early stage retinal degen-
eration. Previous optogenetic therapies have been suited to
patients with no light perception. However, the most common
forms of blindness, including AMD, maintain peripheral vision
but lose the photoreceptors that mediate central, high acuity
vision. Delivery of MW-opsin locally to macular and foveal
regions may restore useful central vision to these patients.
The unique combination of properties distinguishes MW-opsin
for clinical application in patients suffering from a wide range of
degenerative retinal diseases that lead to loss of photoreceptor
cells. While MW-opsin operates well in white light, it differs from
the other cone opsins in wavelength sensitivity, displaying
behavioral light avoidance consistent with the medium wave
action spectrum. This selectivity holds an exciting potential for
future expansion to restoration of color vision once advances in
genetic and viral capsid targeting allow different cone opsins to be
expressed in specific cell subtypes.
In summary, MW-opsin in RGCs restores to a blind mouse
model of retinitis pigmenotosa the ability to recognize visual
patterns on an LCD computer display, holding promise for
enabling blind patients to read and use video. Moreover, it
restores visual function with three-dimensional objects in indoor

 light, suggesting that it will support vision during ambulatory
activity in patients. The system adapts to light levels between
indoor and outdoor illumination, a built-in adaptation that cir-
cumvents the need for intensifying goggles. The combination of
speed, sensitivity, and adaptation holds promise for vision
restoration under natural and changing conditions.
Methods
Animals and AAVs. Wt mice (C57BL/6 J) and rd1 mice (C3H) were purchased
from the Jackson Laboratory and housed on a 12-h light/dark cycle with food and
water ad libitum. cDNA encoding vertebrate medium wave cone opsin or rho-
dopsin was linked with yellow florescent protein (YFP) gene on the c-terminus and
inserted in an established viral cassette under control of the human synapsin
promoter (hsyn-1). Gene and promoter was flanked by inverted terminal repeat
domains, stabilized by a polyadenylation signal sequence (polyA) with a wood-
chuck hepatitis post-transcriptional regulatory element (WPRE) and packaged in
the AAV 2/2-4YF capsid. The titer of AAVs was determined via qPCR relative to
inverted repeat domains standard and reported to contain 1013–1014 viral genomes.
AAVs were produced as previously described1. Vector was delivered in a 2 μl
volume to the vitreous of the rd1 mouse eye via microinjection using a blunt 32-
gauge Hamilton syringe though an incision made posterior of the ora serrata using
a sharp 30-gauge needle. rAAV injections were at p30–p60 and in vivo and in vitro
experiments at p90–p160. Mice were anesthetized with IP ketamine (72 mg/kg) and
xylazine (64 mg/kg). Eyes were anesthetized with proparacaine (0.5%) and pupils
were dilated with phenylephrine (2.5%) and tropicamide (1%).
Tissue preparation and immunohistochemistry. Mice >4–6 weeks post-AAV2/2-
hsyn-MW-coneopsin-YFP treatment were sacrificed, eyes were fixed in 4% paraf-
ormaldehyde (Ted Pella) (30 min), retinas were removed and washed thoroughly
using PBS and flat mounted on slides using Vectashield (Vector Laboratories)
medium impregnated with 4,6-diamidino-2-phenylindole (DAPI) (cell nuclei stain
—blue). For retinal sections, whole mounts were embedded in agarose (Sigma) and
sectioned transverse using a vibratome (Leica Microsystems) at medium speed,
maximum vibration, and 180-μm thickness. Retinal tissues used for immunohis-
tochemistry on retinal cryosections or whole mounts were processed and examined
by confocal microscopy (Leica TCS SP5; Leica Microsystems).
Electrophysiology and light stimulation. HEK cell recordings we performed
using standard electrophysiological techniques previously established22,62,63.
Briefly, cells were clamped in whole cell mode in a high external potassium solution
(50 mM), and held at VH = −80 mV, to provide an inward driving force for
potassium. 5–10 s pulses of light were given at low intensity (1 mW cm−2) at
535 nm (for MW-opsin) or 500 nm (for rhodopsin). MEA recordings were per-
formed on wt (C57BL/6 J) mice, and untreated and treated rd1 mice at >p90
6–16 weeks following AAV injection experimental retina were excised from the eye
under dim red light, mounted on 4 μm cell membranes and placed in an incubator
(35 °C) for 30 min and perfused with exogenous chromophore 9-cis retinal within
the Ames media. Retinal tissue was placed ganglion cell side down4 in the
recording chamber (pMEA 100/30iR-Tpr; Multi Channel Systems) of a 60-channel
MEA system with a constant perfusion of Ames recording media (32 °C). A Multi
Channel Systems harp weight (Scientific Instruments—Slice grids) was placed on
the retina to prevent movement and vacuum was applied to the retina using a
pump (perforated MEA1060 system with CVP; Multi Channel Systems), improving
electrode-to-tissue contact and to provide improved signal-to-noise ratios across
retinas. Additionally, a dry crystal of exogenous chromophore 9-cis retinal was
dissolved in 2 μl 100% ethanol under dark conditions. Dissolved retinal was then
added to 100 μl matrigel on ice and added to the top of the harp, just above the
retina, in order to provide a proximal reservoir of chromophore (pseudo-RPE).
Additionally, 9-cis retinal was dissolved in the recording solution and perfused
consistently into the recording chamber. Further detail regarding MEA methods
are previously detailed in Gaub et al. (2015)1. Illumination in vitro was by a 300-W
mercury arc lamp (DG-4; Sutter Instruments) with a 535/50 nm bandpass filter for
MW-opsin or a 510/89 nm bandpass filter for rhodopsin. Light intensity was
controlled by modifying the light source duty cycle or by using neutral density
filters and ranged from 0.02 μW cm−2 to 20 mW cm−2 (535/50 nm) 0.06 μW cm−2
to 57 mW cm−2 (510/89 nm). Illumination protocols consisted of 100 ms light
flashes at 60 s intervals unless otherwise specified. Contrast experiments on the
MEA were performed using an Epson 1040 home theater projector collimated
through a shutter and 4× objective so that the entire recording area of the
retina was illuminated. Various percentages of gray scale were projected. 100%
light = 25 µW cm−2. Relative comparisons with natural light intensities were
obtained in various environments using direct light measurement with a power
meter (Thorlabs) (see Comparing light sensitivity of optogenetic probes, below).
Spectral component of white light measured using a CCD Spectrometer with
Fourier Transform Optical Spectrum Analyzer software (Thorlabs). See Supple-
mentary Methods for further description. In vivo recordings were performed as
described in Supplementary Methods and previously described by Veit et al.64.
MEA data acquisition and analysis. Retinal activity on the MEA was sampled at
25 kHz filtered between 100 and 2000 Hz and recorded using MC_rack software
(Multi Channel Systems). Voltage traces were converted to spike trains offline and
the spikes recorded at each electrode were sorted into single units, which we
defined as “cells,” via principal component analysis using Offline Sorter (Plexon-
64bit) with each electrode commonly identifying 1–3 cells. Single-unit spike
clusters or channels were exported to MATLAB (MathWorks) and were analyzed
and graphed with custom software. All firing rates were extracted from traces
averaged with 20–50 ms bins over 3–10 light response cycles unless otherwise
specified, details of which are denoted in figure legends. Rasters were generated
from average firing rates. Spontaneous activity in the degenerative retina was
variable within and across samples so thresholds were applied individually so that
responses could be identified from spontaneous spiking. Responses across cells and
across retina were normalized using the Light Response Index (LRI) adopted from
Tochitsky et al.11 and Gaub et al.20 (LRI = (peak firing rate in the light−average
firing rate in dark)/peak firing rate in the light + average firing rate in dark). Under
experiments where conditions were changed within retina (light sensitivity, light
and dark adaption, and dependence of response on flash duration etc.) the
responses were normalized to the peak of the greatest response from baseline and
channels were tracked across all recording parameters. For response recovery of
MW-opsin and rhodopsin, peak responses for averaged population of cells within
each retina were compared with light responses for 4 sequential flashes and were
visualized, extracted and normalized to the first flash. Response sensitivity of MW-
opsin and rhodopsin were determined by averaging of 4–5 (at 0.02–60 μW cm−2)
or 3–2 (at 0.2–6 mW cm−2) 100 ms light flashes with 60 s intervals. For our ana-
lysis we measured the average peak response of each retina and fitted the fast decay
component with a single exponential. All curve fitting and kinetic analysis was
performed in Clampfit 10.6 (Molecular Devices). Cells were defined as “respon-
ders” if the LRI satisfied the condition LRI >0.1. The width of response at half
maximum of peak from baseline was determined manually using Clampfit 10.6
measurements. Intensity-response relations were fit with a single Boltzmann and
normalized to the fit between 0 and 1.
Tissue preparation and immunohistochemistry. Mice were sacrificed
>4–6 weeks after intravitreal injection of AAV2/2-hsyn-MW-coneopsin-YFP
treatment. Eyes were isolated and fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde (Ted Pella)
(30 min) and either flat mounted or embedded in agarose (Sigma) and sectioned in
transverse using a vibratome (Leica Microsystems), as done previously19,20,22.
Retinal tissues were examined by confocal microscopy (Leica TCS SP5; Leica
Microsystems). See Supplementary Methods for further description.
Statistics. To assess statistical significance of MEA recordings, nonparametric
two-tailed Mann–Whitney U tests where applied. For learned dark avoidance
behavior and the learned pattern discrimination behaviors significance was
determined in two ways. (1) Significance for behavioral performance was calculated
using two-tailed unpaired student’s t-tests with Bonferroni correction when
applicable. Significance was also determined by computing the proportion of
successful performances (2). A success was defined as greater than the sum of the
control group average and standard deviation. Success ratios were then calculated
for each condition and graphed in the Supplementary Figures as proportion of
avoidance. To determine significance in differences between conditions a pairwise
contingency table was then constructed, and a Two-Sided Pearson’s Chi-Square
Test was initially conducted. To correct for any conditions with a small n, a One-
Sided Fisher’s Exact Test was also conducted (Supplementary Table 1).
Behavioral analyses. The 2-chamber light-dark passive avoidance test was per-
formed as described previously19,20,22,23. White light (wavelength range) at ~100
μW cm−2 or either blue light (460/45 nm) or green light (535/50 nm) at 0.5–25 μW
cm−2 was mounted above the chamber with homogeneously distributed light.
Animal movements were tracked using IR sensors on the shuttle box. Time spent
in the light and dark chambers was measured and analyzed using Graphic State and
Graphic State RT (Coulbourn Instruments).
Fear conditioning experiments were performed as described previously22 using
Coulbourn single shock chamber with an LED screen that presented the visual cue
mounted to the ceiling of the chamber. Animals were subjected to paired or
unpaired light cued fear conditioning consisting of three shock trials at 0.7 mA over
a span of 15 min. Freezing behavior in anticipation of the shock was recorded by
Coulbourn’s FreezeFrame software and normalized to movement behavior
gathered before the stimulation. Performance was compared between paired and
unpaired cohorts in order to determine if a fear response was conditioned to the
stimulus transition.
Modified active avoidance was assayed as previously described19, using the
Coulbourn shuttle box (H10-11M-SC), however, now iPad tablet screens were
mounted onto the shuttle cage wall, each displaying one of two images that differed
in orientation or distance between two lines but were otherwise of equal shape, size,
and light intensity. The aversive image side was paired with a foot shock of 0.7 mA.
Upon recall the light patterns were reversed to avoid a bias for location and time
spent on each side was recorded. Adaptation was tested by dimming or brightening
the display to different intensities. Visual discrimination optical angle calculations

 were performed using the parameters of the behavioral shuttle cage (15.24 × 36
cm), the distance from the decision point (divider), the central position of the LCD
panel (18.85 cm), and the parameters of the stimulus pattern (1–6 cm distance
between the parallel lines) using the optical (physical) angle equation. Visual
angle = V = 2tan−1((D/2)/(L)) = 18 degrees = 0.33–0.49 radians. Cycles per
degree = 1/V~0.056 cpd. This is ~9-fold lower than performance in visually intact
wt mice (~0.3–0.5cpd) reported in other studies40,55–57.
For exploratory behavior analysis, two objects were placed in a 50 × 50 cm open
field box. Animals were positioned in the empty box and allowed to explore freely
over the course of 10 min. The following day, two novel objects were placed in the
box and animals were again positioned along the wall of the box and allowed to
explore freely for 10 min while the arena was filmed continuously. Using Noldus
Technology Ethosvision XT v13.5, videos were analyzed for distance traveled (cm),
the velocity of travel (cm/s), the latency (s), velocity (cm/s), and distance traveled
(cm) to arrive at and explore each object.
