Background
Repetitive task training (RTT) involves the active practice of task-specific motor activities and is a component of current therapy
approaches in stroke rehabilitation.
Objectives
Primary objective: To determine if RTT improves upper limb function/reach and lower limb function/balance in adults after stroke.
Secondary objectives: 1) To determine the effect of RTT on secondary outcome measures including activities of daily living, global
motor function, quality of life/health status and adverse events. 2) To determine the factors that could influence primary and secondary
outcome measures, including the effect of ’dose’ of task practice; type of task (whole therapy, mixed or single task); timing of the
intervention and type of intervention.
Search methods
We searched the Cochrane Stroke Group Trials Register (4 March 2016); the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CEN-
TRAL) (the Cochrane Library 2016, Issue 5: 1 October 2006 to 24 June 2016); MEDLINE (1 October 2006 to 8 March 2016);
Embase (1 October 2006 to 8 March 2016); CINAHL (2006 to 23 June 2016); AMED (2006 to 21 June 2016) and SPORTSDiscus
(2006 to 21 June 2016).
Selection criteria
Randomised/quasi-randomised trials in adults after stroke, where the intervention was an active motor sequence performed repetitively
within a single training session, aimed towards a clear functional goal.

 Data collection and analysis
Two review authors independently screened abstracts, extracted data and appraised trials. We determined the quality of evidence
within each study and outcome group using the Cochrane ’Risk of bias’ tool and GRADE (Grades of Recommendation, Assessment,
Development and Evaluation) criteria. We did not assess follow-up outcome data using GRADE. We contacted trial authors for
additional information.
Main results
We included 33 trials with 36 intervention-control pairs and 1853 participants. The risk of bias present in many studies was unclear
due to poor reporting; the evidence has therefore been rated ’moderate’ or ’low’ when using the GRADE system.
There is low-quality evidence that RTT improves arm function (standardised mean difference (SMD) 0.25, 95% confidence interval
(CI) 0.01 to 0.49; 11 studies, number of participants analysed = 749), hand function (SMD 0.25, 95% CI 0.00 to 0.51; eight studies,
number of participants analysed = 619), and lower limb functional measures (SMD 0.29, 95% CI 0.10 to 0.48; five trials, number of
participants analysed = 419).
There is moderate-quality evidence that RTT improves walking distance (mean difference (MD) 34.80, 95% CI 18.19 to 51.41; nine
studies, number of participants analysed = 610) and functional ambulation (SMD 0.35, 95% CI 0.04 to 0.66; eight studies, number
of participants analysed = 525). We found significant differences between groups for both upper-limb (SMD 0.92, 95% CI 0.58 to
1.26; three studies, number of participants analysed = 153) and lower-limb (SMD 0.34, 95% CI 0.16 to 0.52; eight studies, number
of participants analysed = 471) outcomes up to six months post treatment but not after six months. Effects were not modified by
intervention type, dosage of task practice or time since stroke for upper or lower limb. There was insufficient evidence to be certain
about the risk of adverse events.
Authors’ conclusions
There is low- to moderate-quality evidence that RTT improves upper and lower limb function; improvements were sustained up to six
months post treatment. Further research should focus on the type and amount of training, including ways of measuring the number
of repetitions actually performed by participants. The definition of RTT will need revisiting prior to further updates of this review in
order to ensure it remains clinically meaningful and distinguishable from other interventions.

Repetitive task training for improving functional ability after stroke
Review question: What are the effects of repeated practice of functional tasks on recovery after stroke when compared with usual care
or placebo treatments?
Background: Stroke can cause problems with movement, often down one side of the body. While some recovery is common over time,
about one third of people have continuing problems. Repeated practice of functional tasks (e.g. lifting a cup) is a treatment approach
used to help with recovery of movement after stroke. This approach is based on the simple idea that in order to improve our ability to
perform tasks we need to practice doing that particular task numerous times, like when we first learned to write. The types of practice
that people do, and the time that they spend practicing, may affect how well this treatment works. To explore this further we also
looked at different aspects of repetitive practice that may influence how well it works.
Study characteristics: We identified 33 studies with 1853 participants. Studies included a wide range of tasks to practice, including
lifting a ball, walking, standing up from sitting and circuit training with a different task at each station. The evidence is current to June
2016.
Key results: In comparison with usual care (standard physiotherapy) or placebo groups, people who practiced functional tasks showed
small improvements in arm function, hand function, walking distance and measures of walking ability. Improvements in arm and leg
function were maintained up to six months later. There was not enough evidence to be certain about the risk of adverse events, for
example falls. Further research is needed to determine the best type of task practice, and whether more sustained practice could show
better results.
Quality of the evidence: We classified the quality of the evidence as low for arm function, hand function and lower limb functional
measures, and as moderate for walking distance and functional ambulation. The quality of the evidence for each outcome was limited

 due poor reporting of study details (particularly in earlier studies), inconsistent results across studies and small numbers of study
participants in some comparisons.

Description of the condition
Although the age-related incidence of stroke may be falling, the
absolute number of people who have a stroke every year and the
overall global burden of stroke in terms of disability-adjusted life-
years are increasing (Feigin 2014). Stroke is still the major cause of
long-term neurological disability in adults (Wolfe 2000). Preva-
lence rates of disability and impairment vary according to sam-
pling of cohorts, but in the acute stage of stroke approximately
half of all stroke survivors are left with severe functional problems
(Lawrence 2001). Estimates of recovery of independent ambu-
lation in studies recruiting cohorts early after stroke range from
41% to 85% (Dallas 2008; Feigin 1996; Kwah 2013; Verbeek
2011; Wade 1987; Wandel 2000); those of recovery of indepen-
dent upper limb function range from 32% to 34% (Au-Yeung
2009; Heller 1987; Nijland 2010). Only 5% to 20% of people
with initial upper limb impairment after stroke fully regain arm
function, with 30% to 66% regaining no functional use at six
months (Heller 1987; Nakayama 1994; Sunderland 1989; Wade
1983). At three weeks and six months after stroke, 40% and 15%
of people are unable to walk independently indoors (Wade 1987),
with only 18% regaining unrestricted walking ability (Lord 2004).
Description of the intervention
Systematic reviews of treatment interventions for the paretic upper
limb suggest that participants benefit from exercise programmes
in which functional tasks are directly trained (Van Peppen 2004).
A meta-analysis has shown that more intensive therapy may at
least improve the rate of activities of daily living (ADL) recov-
ery (Kwakkel 2004), particularly if a direct functional approach
is adopted (Kwakkel 1999; Van der Lee 2001). More recently, a
review of the evidence for physical therapy post stroke concluded
there is strong evidence for high intensity practice (additional ther-
apy time of 17 hours over 10 weeks) with a high number of rep-
etitions within a single-treatment session and a functional goal
(Verbeek 2014). Repetitive task practice combines elements of
both intensity of practice and functional relevance.
How the intervention might work
Many aspects of rehabilitation involve repetition of movement.
Repeated motor practice has been hypothesised to reduce muscle
weakness and spasticity (Nuyens 2002), and to form the phys-
iological basis of motor learning (Butefisch 1995), while senso-
rimotor coupling contributes to the adaptation and recovery of
neuronal pathways (Dobkin 2004). Active cognitive involvement,
functional relevance and knowledge of performance are hypoth-
esised to enhance learning (Carr 1987; Schmidt 2014). How-
ever, most interventions evaluated in randomised controlled trials
(RCTs) do not explicitly target specific pathophysiological pro-
cesses (Langhorne 2009).
Why it is important to do this review
Repetitive task training (RTT) has the potential to be a resource-
efficient component of stroke rehabilitation, including delivery
in a group setting, or self-initiated practice in the home environ-
ment. Repetition of movement is the basic mechanism of action
associated with many interventions showing promise in improv-
ing motor function (Langhorne 2009) (e.g. constraint-induced
movement therapy (Corbetta 2015), treadmill training (Mehrholz
2014), and training with electromechanical devices, for example
robots (Mehrholz 2015b)). This review is important as it consid-
ers whether RTT alone leads to functional gains in the absence of
other mechanisms of action.

Primary objective: To determine if repetitive task training (RTT)
improves upper limb function/reach and lower limb function/
balance in adults after stroke.
Secondary objectives: 1) To determine the effect of RTT on
secondary outcome measures including activities of daily living
(ADL), global motor function, quality of life/health status, and
adverse events. 2) To determine the factors that could influence
primary and secondary outcome measures, including the effect of
’dose’ of task practice; type of task (whole therapy, mixed or single
task); timing of the intervention; and type of intervention.

Criteria for considering studies for this review
Types of studies
We included RCTs and quasi-randomised trials (defined as meth-
ods of allocating people to a trial that are not random, but are
intended to produce similar groups when used to allocate partic-
ipants, such as those allocating by date or alternation (Higgins
2011)). One arm of the trial had to include RTT, compared against
usual practice (including ’no treatment’), or an attention control

 group. We excluded studies where RTT was a component of both
the experimental and control treatments. Examples of attention
control treatments are comparable time spent receiving therapy
on a different limb, or participating in an activity with no poten-
tial motor benefits. We accepted usual practice comparison groups
when the intervention received by the control group was consid-
ered a normal or usual component of stroke rehabilitation prac-
tices,includingneurophysiological ororthopaedicapproaches. We
assumed that, early after stroke, usual practice would mean that
people would receive some therapy.
Types of participants
Adults (18 years and older) who have suffered a stroke. Stroke
is defined by the World Health Organization (WHO) as “a syn-
drome of rapidly developing symptoms and signs of focal, and at
times global, loss of cerebral function lasting more than 24 hours
or leading to death, with no apparent cause other than that of vas-
cular origin” (WHO 1989). We included trials starting any time
after an acute stroke and in any setting. We excluded studies of
participants with mixed aetiology (for example, participants with
acquired brain injury) unless data were available relating to the
participants with stroke only.
Types of interventions
One arm of the trial had to include an intervention where an active
motor sequence was performed repetitively within a single training
session, and where the practice was aimed towards a clear func-
tional goal. Functional goals could involve complex whole tasks
(e.g. picking up a cup), or pre-task movements for a whole limb or
limb segment such as grasp, grip, or movement in a trajectory to
facilitate an ADL-type activity (e.g. sit-to-stand). To be included,
trials of repetitive activity were required to involve complex multi-
joint movement with functional measurement of outcome, rather
than the exercise of a single joint or muscle group orientated to
motor performance outcomes.
We included any intensity and duration of task training schedule
but only included trials if the time duration or number of rep-
etitions within a session of practice and the number of sessions
delivered could be identified. We included trials that clearly used
motor relearning as a whole therapy approach if we could identify
the amount of task-specific training received.
We included trials combining RTT with person-delivered, me-
chanical or robotic movement assistance if the purpose of the assis-
tance was to facilitate a task-related repetition. We excluded stud-
ies if assisted movement was predominant, or could not easily be
related to a functional goal.
We excluded trials if they combined RTT with another interven-
tion where the influence of task repetition could not be isolated,
for example electrical stimulation, virtual environments, forced
use, bilateral movement, or mental rehearsal. We also excluded
trials if the intervention used mechanical means simply to increase
strength or endurance.
We contacted trial authors for clarification of the nature of the
intervention if it was unclear whether the trial met our definition.
Types of outcome measures
Primary outcomes
The primary outcomes we chose were global and limb-specific
functional measures. Due tothe large range of measuresusedacross
trials, selection of outcome measures was done by the review au-
thors to facilitate quantitative pooling. If more than one measure
was available in an outcome category, we prioritised measures of
functional motor ability used in the primary trials as follows in
the different categories.
• Upper limb function/reach
◦ Arm function: Motor Assessment Scale - upper limb
component, Action Research Arm Test, Frenchay Arm Test,
Wolf Motor Function Test, Functional Test of the Hemiparetic
Upper Extremity, Box and Block Test, Southern Motor Group
Assessment
◦ Hand function: Motor Assessment Scale - hand,
Jebsen Test of Hand Function*, Peg Test*, Stroke Impact Scale -
hand domain
◦ Sitting balance/reach: Reaching Performance Scale,
Functional Reach
• Lower limb function/standing balance
◦ Lower limb function: walking distance, walking speed,
functional ambulation, Timed Up and Go Test/sit-to-stand*;
measures of lower limb function, such as the Rivermead Motor
Assessment, Sødring Motor Evaluation Scale, Walking Ability
Questionnaire, Stroke Impact Scale - mobility domain.
◦ Standing balance/reach: Berg Balance Scale, Standing
Equilibrium Index, Functional Reach, Activities Based
Confidence Scale, Timed Balance Test
Secondary outcomes
• Activities of daily living (ADL)
◦ Barthel Index, Functional Independence Measure,
Modified Rankin Scale, Global Dependency Scale, Canadian
Occupational Performance Measure
• Global motor function (including arm, leg and trunk and
gross motor function [e.g. the ability to move from lying to
sitting on the side of the bed])
◦ Motor Assessment Scale, Rivermead Motor
Assessment Scale, Sødring Motor Evaluation Scale
• Measures of quality of life, health status, user satisfaction,
carer burden, motivation or perceived improvement
◦ For example, Nottingham Health Profile*, SF36,
Dartmouth Cooperative Chart*

 • Adverse events
◦ For example, pain, injury, falls
*Items marked with an asterisk are measures where a low score
equals a positive outcome. The data were expressed as negative
values for these studies. In all other measures, a high score indicates
a good outcome, and data were expressed as positive values.
Timing of outcome assessment
Primary outcome timing was at the end of the treatment period. If
the end of the treatment period was not clearly defined, we chose
outcome measures at three months post treatment as primary, be-
cause we considered this to be the average period of rehabilita-
tion input. Outcome data are presented for follow-up less than six
months post treatment, and between six months to one year post
treatment. At both follow-up points, we entered data for the pri-
mary outcome if a primary outcome was specified and data were
available; otherwise, we included data for available outcomes with
similar outcomes chosen across studies where data were provided
for more than one outcome.
Search methods for identification of studies
See the ’Specializedregister’ sectioninthe Cochrane Stroke Group
module. We searched for trials in all languages and arranged trans-
lation of relevant papers where necessary.
Electronic searches
We searched the Cochrane Stroke Group Trials Register; this was
searched by the Managing Editor on 4 March 2016. In addition,
we searchedthe following electronic databases: the Cochrane Cen-
tral Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL: the Cochrane Li-
brary2016, Issue 5:1October2006 to 24 June 2016; Appendix 1);
MEDLINE (1 October 2006 to 8 March 2016; Appendix 2); Em-
base (1 October 2006 to 8 March 2016; Appendix 3); CINAHL
(2006 to 23 June 2016; Appendix 4); AMED (2006 to 21 June
2016; Appendix 5); and SPORTSDiscus (2006 to 21 June 2016;
Appendix 6). We developed the MEDLINE search strategy with
the help of the Cochrane Stroke Group Information Specialist and
adapted it for the other databases.
Searching other resources
We searched reference lists of relevant studies and contacted au-
thors to identify missing data. In an effort to identify further pub-
lished, unpublished and ongoing trials we searched the following
resources using broad descriptors for stroke, rehabilitation, and
physical therapy:
• ClinicalTrials.gov 15 June 2016 (http://clinicaltrials.gov/);
• World Health Organization (WHO) International Clinical
Trials Registry Platform Search Portal 15 June 2016 (http://
apps.who.int/trialsearch/).
Data collection and analysis
Selection of studies
Tworeviewauthors(fromJC, LC,BF, JH,NM,LT)independently
screened references identified from the searches of the electronic
databasesandexcludedirrelevantstudies.We obtainedthe full-text
papers of the remaining studies and the same two review authors
assessed these for inclusion according to the inclusion criteria. We
resolved disagreements through discussion and by referral to a
thirdreviewauthorasnecessary. We providedreasonsforexcluding
potentially relevant studies.
Data extraction and management
Two review authors (from JC, LC, NM, LT) independently con-
ducted data extraction using a pre-designed data extraction form
for each selected study. Data extracted included citation details,
method of randomisation, study population, intervention meth-
ods and delivery, reasons for losses to follow-up, post therapy and
follow-up outcome measures, and methodological quality. In ad-
dition, we extracted information relating to treatment monitor-
ing, acceptability, and adherence where available. We resolved dis-
agreements by discussion, and by referral to a third author (LT)
as necessary. We contacted study authors by email to request any
missing information necessary for the review.
Assessment of risk of bias in included studies
Two review authors (LT and NM) used Cochrane’s ’Risk of bias’
tool to independently assess the methodological quality of the
included studies (Higgins 2011). The tool covers the domains of
sequence generation, allocation concealment, blinding of outcome
assessors, incomplete outcome data and selective reporting. We
classified items as ’low risk’, ’high risk’ or ’unclear risk’ of bias. We
resolved disagreements with help from a third review author (JC).
Measures of treatment effect
For continuous outcomes using similar measurement scales, we
used the mean difference (MD) with 95% confidence intervals
(CIs). If similar outcomes were measured using different outcome
scales, we combined results using standardised mean difference
(SMD) and 95% CIs. For continuous outcomes, we extracted
means and standard deviations of post-therapy scores. We also
extracted means and standard deviations of change from baseline
scores where available across trials. We used the Chi2 test to explore
differences between subgroups.
One outcome contained both dichotomous and continuous mea-
surement units, which we analysed using the generic inverse vari-
ance method. Four different outcome measures were used in seven
trials. Three of these were continuous measures: Timed Up &

 Go Test (Blennerhassett 2004b; Dean 2000; Salbach 2004a); Mo-
tor Assessment Scale sit-to-stand (Langhammer 2000; Van Vliet
2005); sit-to-stand (time in seconds) (Howe 2005), the exception
being ’Number of people able to stand independently and safely
on two consecutive occasions’ (Barreca 2004). For the six trials
with continuous outcomes, we calculated the SMD and corre-
sponding standard error in Review Manager 5 (RevMan 2014)
from the SMD estimate and CI and re-entered for the GIV-based
meta-analysis of sit-to stand. For Barreca 2004, we converted the
log OR and its standard error (SE) to an approximate SMD scale.
Unit of analysis issues
Studies with multiple treatment groups
Two trials compared upper versus lower limb training, so are in-
cluded as four intervention-control pairs (Blennerhassett 2004;
Salbach 2004). Blennerhassett 2004a refers to a upper limb train-
ing group versus lower limb attention control, and Blennerhassett
2004b refers to an lower limb training group versus upper limb
training attention control. Salbach 2004a refers to a lower limb
training group versus upper limb training attention control, and
Salbach 2004b refers to the upper limb training group versus lower
limb training attention control. In the subgroup and sensitivity
analyses, these intervention-control pairs are not included as sep-
arate trials, as we considered that the impacts of the interventions
on upper and lower limb function in the same person might not
be completely independent. Results for the primary outcome of
the lower limb training groups were selected as representative, as
studies were showing that treatment effects were greater in the
lower limb than in the upper limb. One trial compared upper
and lower limb training groups against the same control group
(Kwakkel 1999). To avoid the control group being included twice,
and to use a limb-specific rather than a global or ADL measure, we
selected the lower limb training versus splint control comparison
for the sensitivity analyses.
Dealing with missing data
If data were not in a form suitable for quantitative pooling, we
contacted trial authors for additional information .We attempted
to obtain post therapy scores from trial authors who had reported
median and inter-quartile ranges. We presented trials reporting
change scores with standard deviations in separate analyses.
Assessment of heterogeneity
We assessed the degree of heterogeneity among the trials using the
I2 statistic for each outcome. If less than or equal to 50%, we used
a fixed-effect meta-analysis. If the I2 statistic was greater than 50%,
we explored the individual trial characteristics to identify potential
sources of heterogeneity. We then performed meta-analysis using
both fixed-effect and random-effects modelling to assess sensitivity
to the choice of modelling approach.
We addressed clinical and methodological diversity by incorporat-
ing subgroup or sensitivity analyses for type of participant (time
from stroke), intervention (type and amount of intervention), and
study design (comparison group, equivalence of treatment).
To test for subgroup effects we used the Chi2 test with a 5%
significance level.
Assessment of reporting biases
We searched clinical trial registers to assist in reducing publication
bias. We also investigated selective outcome reporting through
the comparison of the methods section of papers with the results
reported.
Data synthesis
Where there were acceptable levels of heterogeneity, we pooled
results. We used both random-effects and fixed-effect meta-anal-
ysis with 95% CI using Review Manager 5 (RevMan 2014). We
pooled outcomes measured with different instruments using the
SMD.
We documented the quality of evidence for each outcome based
on criteria considered within the GRADE (Grading of Recom-
mendations Assessment, Development and Evaluation) approach
(Guyatt 2008); this includes the following.
• Risk of bias due to flawed design or conduct of studies
(sequence generation, allocation concealment, blinding of
outcome assessors and incomplete outcome data). We re-assessed
all studies from the original review using the updated ’Risk of
bias’ tool (Higgins 2011).
• Imprecision (e.g. when confidence intervals for treatment
effect are wide).
• Inconsistency (e.g. when point estimates vary widely, the I²
is large).
• Indirectness (e.g. variations in participants, interventions,
comparisons and outcomes).
• Publication bias (may be explored with the use of funnel
plots and classed as not suspected, suspected, strongly suspected
or very strongly suspected).
Three review authors (JC, NM and LT) assessed and documented
risk of bias related to study design, imprecision, inconsistency, in-
directness and publication bias for each outcome within compar-
isons presented.
We employed GRADE to interpret findings and to create a ’Sum-
mary of findings’ table (Guyatt 2008) for the following outcomes:
arm function, hand function, walking distance, walking speed,
functional ambulation, lower limb functional measures and global
motor function. The table provides outcome-specific information
concerning the overall quality of evidence from studies included
in the comparison, the magnitude of effect of the intervention and
11

 the sum of available data on the outcomes considered. We down-
graded the evidence from ’high quality’ by one level for serious (or
by two for very serious) study limitations (risk of bias, indirectness
of evidence, serious inconsistency, imprecision of effect estimates
or potential publication bias). We did not assess follow-up out-
comes using GRADE.
Subgroup analysis and investigation of heterogeneity
We undertook planned subgroup analyses for all primary out-
comes separately for upper limb and lower limb function, due
to the potential differential impact (Table 1). Planned subgroup
analyses were as follows:
• dosage of task practice: dosage of task practice was
calculated by multiplying the number of weeks, by the number
of sessions per week, by the session duration in hours. Trials were
divided into those providing up to and including 20 hours
training, and those providing more than 20 hours training in
total;
• time since stroke: mean time since stroke at recruitment
was used to classify trials as within zero to six months post stroke
or more than six months post stroke. As a number of trials
recruited very early post stroke, a post-hoc analysis grouping was
included for trials recruiting within 14 days of stroke;
• type of intervention: trials were classified as either 1) whole
therapy approaches, where rehabilitation in total was directed by
a motor relearning or movement science approach, 2) mixed
functional task training, where therapy included a mixed
combination of functional tasks, and 3) single task training,
where one task was practiced repeatedly.
We intended to consider if effect sizes were related to whether
training was based on pre-functional versus functional activities, or
pre-intervention level of disability. In the event, we excluded most
pre-functional trials because they contained a large proportion of
passive or active-assisted movement, and levels of disability proved
too difficult to classify because of mixed groups of participants
and unsuitable measures and data for this purpose. Therefore, we
have not presented these planned subgroup analyses.
We prioritised outcomes for subgroup analyses by the study au-
thors’ primary outcome choice, or the review authors’ judgement
as to the most suitable measure for the intervention, for example a
balance measure for trials training balance functions. If more than
one measure was available, we prioritised lower limb outcomes
in the following order: 1) walking speed, 2) walking distance, 3)
functional ambulation, and 4) lower limb functional measures. We
prioritised upper limb outcomes as 1) arm function, and 2) hand
function. We omitted one trial from the subgroup and sensitivity
analyses because it used a dichotomous outcome (Barreca 2004).
Sensitivity analysis
We carried out planned sensitivity analyses for allocation conceal-
ment (adequate or inadequate/unclear). In addition, we included
post hoc sensitivity analyses to consider the impact of different
comparison groups (attention control, usual care), equivalence of
therapy time (equivalent time, additional time), and intervention
delivery (individual versus group). We did not undertake planned
sensitivity analyses for intervention setting (hospital versus home)
because of an insufficient numbers of trials.

a further 878. We subsequently excluded studies where there was
uncertainty whether or not they met the inclusion criteria - details
are presented in the Characteristics of excluded studies table, In
total, we identified 19 new studies and added them to the 14 stud-

 Included studies
We identified 33 trials, comprising 36 intervention-control pairs,
which met the inclusion criteria. One paper (Kwakkel 1999)
refers to a trial with two intervention-control pairs which have
been referenced separately in the review: Kwakkel 1999a refers
to a lower limb training group versus splint control, Kwakkel
1999b refers to an upper limb training group versus splint con-
trol. Blennerhassett 2004 includes two intervention-control pairs:
Blennerhassett 2004a refers to an upper limb training group versus
lower limb attention control, and Blennerhassett 2004b refers to
a lower limb training group versus upper limb training attention
control. Salbach 2004 has two intervention-control pairs: Salbach
2004a refers to a lower limb training group versus upper limb
training attention control, and Salbach 2004b refers to the upper
limb training group versus lower limb training attention control.
In five trials (Baer 2007; Olawale 2011; Peurala 2009; Winstein
2004; Winstein 2016) there were three arms. We only included
the data for the intervention-control pair of repetitive task training
(RTT) versus control in the review.
Design
Of the 33 included trials, 32 were RCTs (Arya 2012; Baer 2007;
Barreca 2004; Blennerhassett2004; Dean 1997; Dean 2000; Dean
2007; de Sèze 2001; Frimpong 2014; Gordon 2013; Holmgren
2010; Howe 2005; Kim 2012; Kim 2014; Kim 2016; Kwakkel

2004; Song 2015; Tung 2010; van de Port 2012; Van Vliet 2005;
Winstein 2004; Winstein 2016; Yen 2005), and one is a quasi-
randomised trial (Turton 1990). Four of the trials were pilot ran-
domised controlled trials (Dean 2000; de Sèze 2001; Howe 2005;
Winstein 2004). Four of the trials were multicentre (Arya 2012;
Kwakkel 1999; van de Port 2012; Winstein 2016). Nine of the
trials were stratified before randomisation using: baseline level of
walking deficit (Lennon 2009; Peurala 2009; Salbach 2004), cog-
nition and falls risk (Holmgren 2010), gender and side of stroke
(Langhammer 2000); rehabilitation centre (van de Port 2012),
stroke severity (Baer 2007; Winstein 2004), and motor severity
and time from stroke onset (Winstein 2016).
Sample size
Eleven trials had 25 participants or less (Dean 1997; Dean 2000;
Dean 2007; de Sèze 2001; Frimpong 2014; Kim 2012; Kim 2014;
Kim 2016; Park 2011; Song 2015; Turton 1990). Ten trials had
between 26 and 49 participants (Barreca 2004; Blennerhassett
2004; Holmgren 2010; Howe 2005; McClellan 2004; Peurala
2009; Ross 2009; Tung 2010; Winstein 2004; Yen 2005). Twelve
trials had 50 participants or more (Arya 2012; Baer 2007; Gordon
2013; Kwakkel 1999; Langhammer 2000; Lennon 2009; Mudge
2009; Olawale 2011; Salbach 2004; van de Port 2012; Van Vliet
2005; Winstein 2016).
Country
Of the 33 trials, three were carried out in Canada (Barreca 2004;
Dean 2000; Salbach 2004), five in Australia (Blennerhassett 2004;
Dean 1997; Dean 2007; McClellan 2004; Ross 2009), four in the
UK (Baer 2007; Howe 2005; Turton 1990; Van Vliet 2005), two
in Taiwan (Tung 2010; Yen 2005), five in Korea (Kim 2012; Kim
2014; Kim 2016; Park 2011; Song 2015), two in the Netherlands
(Kwakkel 1999; van de Port 2012), two in the USA (Winstein
2004; Winstein 2016), one in Norway (Langhammer 2000), two
in Africa (Frimpong 2014; Olawale 2011), one in India (Arya
2012), one in Jamaica (Gordon 2013), one in Sweden (Holmgren
2010), one in Finland (Peurala 2009), one in Ireland (Lennon
2009), one in New Zealand (Mudge 2009), and one in France (de
Sèze 2001).
Participants
The 33 trials included 2014 participants, of which 1853 were
included in the 36 intervention-control pairs relevant to this re-
view. All of the trials included both genders, with 10 trials hav-
ing more than 60% male participants (Arya 2012; Barreca 2004;
Dean 1997; Dean 2007; Frimpong 2014; Holmgren 2010; Kim
2016; Salbach 2004; Tung 2010; van de Port 2012). In 10 tri-
als, the participants had a mean age of less than 60 (Arya 2012;
Blennerhassett 2004; Frimpong 2014; Kim 2012; Kim 2014;
Olawale 2011; Park 2011; Tung 2010; Turton 1990; van de Port
2012), and in seven trials the mean age was over 70 (Baer 2007;
Holmgren 2010; Howe 2005; Langhammer 2000; Lennon 2009;
Salbach 2004; Van Vliet 2005). Fourteen trials included only par-
ticipants after a first stroke (Arya 2012; Dean 2000; Dean 2007;
de Sèze 2001; Frimpong 2014; Kim 2014; Kim 2016; Kwakkel
1999; Langhammer 2000; Park 2011; Peurala 2009; Tung 2010;
Winstein 2004; Yen 2005). Six trials included participants with
either first or recurrent stroke (Blennerhassett 2004; Holmgren
2010; Howe 2005; Lennon 2009; Mudge 2009; Salbach 2004). In
the remaining trials, it was unclear whether inclusion was limited
to first stroke only.
Mean time since stroke
Mean time since stroke was one month or less in 10 trials
(Barreca 2004; Dean 2007; Howe 2005; Kim 2016; Kwakkel

 1999; Langhammer 2000; Lennon 2009; Peurala 2009; Van Vliet
2005; Winstein 2004), between one and three months in five
trials (Arya 2012; Blennerhassett 2004; de Sèze 2001; Frimpong
2014; Winstein 2016), between three and six months in four tri-
als (Holmgren 2010; McClellan 2004; Turton 1990; van de Port
2012), and between six and 12 months in five trials (Gordon 2013;
Kim 2014; Olawale 2011; Salbach 2004; Yen 2005). Participants
were in the chronic phase of stroke in nine trials (Baer 2007; Dean
1997; Dean2000; Kim2012; Mudge 2009; Park2011; Ross 2009;
Song 2015; Tung 2010).
Interventions
Upper limb RTT interventions were tested in six trials (Arya 2012;
Ross 2009; Turton 1990; Winstein 2004; Winstein 2016; Yen
2005). Lower limb repetitive task-oriented training interventions
were testedin17trials(Barreca 2004; Dean2000; Frimpong 2014;
Gordon 2013; Holmgren 2010; Kim 2012; Kim 2014; Kim 2016;
Lennon 2009; McClellan 2004; Mudge 2009; Olawale 2011; Park
2011; Peurala 2009; Song 2015; Tung 2010; van de Port 2012).
Of these trials, two of the interventions focused specifically on
sit-to-stand practice (Barreca 2004; Tung 2010) and six of the
interventions focused on walking practice (Gordon 2013; Kim
2014; Lennon 2009; Olawale 2011; Park 2011; Peurala 2009).
Three trials investigated RTT interventions for both the upper and
lower limb (Blennerhassett 2004; Kwakkel 1999; Salbach 2004).
Four trials investigated RTT interventions that focused specifically
on: sitting balance (Dean 1997; Dean 2007), trunk control (de
Sèze 2001), and balance (Howe 2005), and two trials investigated
whole therapy approaches (Langhammer 2000; Van Vliet 2005).
Setting
The intervention was delivered solely in an inpatient setting in 11
trials (Barreca 2004; Blennerhassett 2004; Dean 2007; Frimpong
2014; de Sèze 2001; Howe 2005; Kim 2014; Kwakkel 1999;
Lennon 2009; Peurala 2009; Winstein 2016). In three trials the in-
tervention was delivered during both inpatient and outpatient re-
habilitation(Ross 2009; VanVliet2005; Winstein 2004), with one
trial continuing to deliver the intervention in community settings
and the patients’ own homes (Langhammer 2000). Nine trials de-
livered the intervention as outpatient rehabilitation (Arya 2012;
Dean 2000; Mudge 2009; Olawale 2011; Park 2011; Salbach
2004; Tung 2010; van de Port 2012; Yen 2005). Two trials de-
livered the intervention in community settings (Gordon 2013;
Holmgren 2010), and four trials delivered the intervention solely
in the patients’ home environments (Baer 2007; Dean 1997;
McClellan 2004; Turton 1990). In three trials it was not clear
in which setting the intervention was delivered (Kim 2012; Kim
2016; Song 2015).
Amount of task practice
The numberof hoursof taskpractice variedconsiderablyacross the
interventions. Six trials were estimated to have provided less than
10 hours training in total (Dean 1997; Dean 2007; Howe 2005;
Lennon 2009; Tung 2010; Van Vliet 2005). A further 16 trials
provided between 10 and 21 hours training (Arya 2012; Barreca
2004; Blennerhassett 2004; Dean 2000; Frimpong 2014; Gordon
2013; Kim 2012; Kim 2014; Langhammer 2000; Mudge 2009;
Olawale 2011; Park 2011; Peurala 2009; Salbach 2004; Song
2015; Winstein 2004). Four trials provided between 30 and 40
hours training (Kim 2016; Ross 2009; van de Port 2012; Winstein
2016), and four trials prescribed more than 40 hours therapy
(Kwakkel 1999; McClellan 2004; Turton 1990; Yen 2005). In
one trial, the number of hours was not reported (Baer 2007). As
only four of the included trials reported the duration of the RTT
component of the task training sessions (Arya 2012; Mudge 2009;
Peurala 2009; Ross 2009), we have used figures for the total du-
ration of the task training sessions as these were more frequently
reported in the included studies.
Duration of training
The length of time that training was spread over varied from two
to four weeks in 19 trials (Arya 2012; Baer 2007; Blennerhassett
2004; Dean 1997; Dean 2000; Dean 2007; de Sèze 2001; Howe
2005; Kim 2012; Kim 2014; Kim 2016; Lennon 2009; Mudge
2009; Park 2011; Peurala 2009; Song 2015; Tung 2010; Winstein
2004; Yen 2005). The intervention was between four and 12
weeks in eight trials (Barreca 2004; Frimpong 2014; Holmgren
2010; McClellan 2004; Ross 2009; Salbach 2004; Turton 1990;
Winstein 2016) and between 12 and 20 weeks in four trials
(Gordon 2013; Kwakkel 1999; Olawale 2011; van de Port 2012).
For two trials, the duration of training was over the inpatient re-
habilitation period, with therapy for some participants in an out-
patient setting if required (Langhammer 2000; Van Vliet 2005).
Intervention delivery
The RTT interventions were delivered by trained therapists in all
but four of the included trials. In three trials trained staff input was
restricted to prescription and review of self-administered home-
work exercise programmes (Baer 2007; McClellan 2004; Turton
1990). Trained therapy assistants provided balance training in
one trial (Howe 2005), and registered practical nurses delivered
sit-to-stand training in one trial (Barreca 2004). A group or cir-
cuit training approach was used in eight studies (Barreca 2004;
Blennerhassett 2004; Dean 2000; Frimpong 2014; Kim 2016;
Mudge 2009; Song 2015; van de Port 2012 ). In one trial it was
unclear who delivered the intervention (Kim 2014).

 Comparison interventions
Eleven trials compared the intervention against an attention con-
trol: two trials used a recreation or cognitive therapy control
group (Barreca 2004; Dean 1997), two used educational ses-
sions (Holmgren 2010; Mudge 2009), one used a splint control
(Kwakkel 1999), one used light massage (Gordon 2013), one used
a sham sitting protocol (Dean 2007) and four used a comparison
training programme for the upper or lower limb (Blennerhassett
2004; Dean 2000; McClellan 2004; Salbach 2004). Eighteen
trials compared the intervention against usual care. Equivalent
hours of therapy were provided in eight trials (Arya 2012; de Sèze
2001; Langhammer 2000; Lennon 2009; Olawale 2011; van de
Port 2012; Van Vliet 2005; Winstein 2016).The RTT group re-
ceived additional practice in 14 trials (Baer 2007; Frimpong 2014;
Holmgren 2010; Howe 2005; Kim 2012; Kim 2014; Kim 2016;
Park 2011; Peurala 2009; Ross 2009; Song 2015; Tung 2010;
Turton 1990; Winstein 2004). It is unclear whether the duration
of therapy for the intervention-control pair was equivalent for Yen
2005.
Outcomes
The 33 included trials used a wide range of different outcome
measures, measurement statistics, and time intervals for follow-up.
Measures selected by the review team for each outcome category
are detailed below, and in Table 2 for ease of reference per outcome
category. In some studies, more than one measure was available
for a category, and in this case, we prioritised measures as detailed
in the Methods section.

(van de Port 2012; Winstein 2016) were measured.
Outcomes used at follow-up
Upper limb outcome measures
We used the following outcomes for Comparisons 2.1.1 and 2.1.2:
Action Research Arm Test (Arya 2012),Time to complete Jeb-
son Taylor Hand Test (Blennerhassett 2004), Sitting Equilibrium
Index (de Sèze 2001), Lateral Reach Test - time to return to

Mudge 2009), Comfortable Walk Test (van de Port 2012) and
Motor Assessment Scale - walking (Langhammer 2000; Van Vliet
2005).
Excluded studies
There is a large number of excluded studies described in
Characteristics of excluded studies. Because of the difficulties
in determining whether trial interventions included task-specific
functional repetition, we have attempted to be as transparent as
possible about the basis on which we excluded trials. The reasons
for exclusion were:
• not repetition, or unable to determine amount of practice:
five studies;
• comparison group also includes repetitive task practice:
nine studies;
• alternative mechanism of action: 10 studies.
We were unable to obtain subgroup data relating to stroke patients
in one study (Sherrington 2008).
Ongoing studies
There are 11 ongoing studies, where the information available
is sufficient to say that the interventions are RTT. Five trials in-
volved training for standing, balance or sit-to-stand (Hariohm
2013; Korner-Bitensky 2013; Kumaran 2010; Stuart 2009; Tanne
2008) . Six trials involved upper limb task-specific training
(NCT02765152; Bosomworth 2013; NCT02235974; CTRI/
2015/06/005877; Schultz 2012; Turton 2011) (Characteristics of
ongoing studies).
Studies awaiting classification
Fourteen studies are awaiting classification (Baglary 2013;
Bhaskar 2009; Brkic 2016; NCT02429180; Eng 2009; Ferrari
2015; Gandhi 2015; Indurkar 2013; Knox 2014; Kumar 2012;

Allocation
Randomsequence generationwasadequate in14trials(Arya 2012;
Baer 2007; Barreca 2004; Dean 2007; de Sèze 2001; Holmgren
2010; Howe 2005; Kwakkel 1999; Mudge 2009; Ross 2009;
Salbach 2004; van de Port 2012; Van Vliet 2005; Winstein 2016).
Allocation concealment was adequate in five trials (Arya 2012;
Holmgren 2010; Howe 2005; Ross 2009; Winstein 2016).
Blinding
20 trials reported blinding of the outcome assessor (Arya 2012;
Barreca 2004; Blennerhassett 2004; Dean 1997; Dean 2007; de
Sèze 2001; Gordon 2013; Holmgren 2010; Howe 2005; Kim
2014;Kim 2016; Langhammer 2000; McClellan 2004; Park2011;
Ross 2009; Tung 2010; van de Port 2012; Van Vliet 2005;
Winstein 2016; Yen 2005), however unblinding occurred in two
trials (Baer 2007; Winstein 2016).
Incomplete outcome data
We deemed 25 trials to be at low risk of bias in relation to in-
complete outcome data (Arya 2012; Baer 2007; Barreca 2004;
Blennerhassett 2004; Dean 1997; Dean 2000; Dean 2007; de
Sèze 2001; Holmgren 2010; Howe 2005; Kim 2012; Kim 2016;
Kwakkel 1999; Langhammer 2000; Lennon 2009; McClellan
2004; Mudge 2009; Peurala 2009; Ross 2009; Salbach 2004;
Turton 1990; van de Port 2012; Winstein 2004; Winstein 2016;
Yen 2005).
Selective reporting
There were no study protocols available for any of the included
trials to allow us to make a judgement of low risk of bias in rela-
tion to selective reporting with the exception of one recent trial
(Winstein 2016) . All primary measures were not reported in five
studies (Lennon 2009; Peurala 2009; van de Port 2012; Van Vliet
2005; Winstein 2016).
Other potential sources of bias
To detect systematic differences in care provided to participants in
comparison groups other than the intervention under investiga-
tion, we assessed trials to determine whether groups were treated
equally. In 15 studies participants in the intervention group re-
ceived additional hours of therapy (Baer 2007; Frimpong 2014;
Holmgren 2010; Howe 2005; Kim 2012; Kim 2014; Kim 2016;
Park 2011; Peurala 2009; Ross 2009; Song 2015; Tung 2010;
Turton 1990; van de Port 2012; Winstein 2004).
There is some evidence of baseline imbalance in 10 trials (de
Sèze 2001; Dean 2000; Dean 2007; Kim 2012; Langhammer
2000; Lennon 2009; Tung 2010; Turton 1990; van de Port 2012;
Van Vliet 2005); in van de Port 2012 analyses were adjusted for
covariates at baseline.

 Primary outcomes
Results are presented for 1) upper limb, and 2) lower limb out-
comes. All results are post therapy, except for Langhammer 2000,
which is three months post stroke, and Van Vliet 2005, which
is three months post baseline. We were not able to obtain data
suitable for pooling from Baer 2007 and Song 2015.
Upper limb function: post treatment
Results are presented for 1) arm function, 2) hand function, and
3) sitting balance and reach.
Comparison 1.1: Arm function
Eleven trials recruiting 844 participants measured arm function
(Arya 2012; Blennerhassett 2004a; Kwakkel 1999b; Langhammer
2000; Ross 2009; Salbach 2004b; Turton 1990; Van Vliet 2005;
Winstein 2004; Winstein 2016; Yen 2005). Data were available
for 88.7% (N = 749) of participants. The impact of functional
training on upper limb function post therapy overall indicated a
statistically significant effect favouring the treatment group: stan-
dardised mean difference (SMD) 0.25, 95% confidence interval
(CI) 0.01 to 0.49 (Analysis 1.1, GRADE: low quality).
Comparison 1.2: Hand function
Eight trials recruiting 701 participants measured hand function (
Arya 2012; Blennerhassett 2004a; Langhammer 2000; Ross 2009;
Salbach 2004b; Turton 1990; Van Vliet 2005; Winstein 2016).
Data were available for 88.3% (N = 619) of participants. The
impact of functional training on hand function was statistically
significant favouring the treatment group: SMD 0.25, 95% CI
0.00 to 0.51 (Analysis 1.2, GRADE: low quality).
Comparison 1.3: Sitting balance/reach
Six trials, recruiting 268 participants, measured sitting balance or
functional reach (de Sèze 2001; Dean 1997; Dean 2007; Howe
2005; Langhammer 2000; Van Vliet2005). Datawere available for
82.8% (N = 222) of participants. There was some heterogeneity
of treatment effects (I2 = 48%), although not sufficient to merit
the use of a random-effects approach. The impact of functional
training on sitting balance and reach was statistically significant:
SMD 0.28, 95% CI 0.01 to 0.55 (Analysis 1.3, GRADE: low
quality).
Upper limb function: follow-up
Comparison 2.1: All outcomes
Less than six months post treatment
Three trials recruiting 158 participants measured some aspect of
upper limb function for retention effects of repetitive task training
(RTT) interventions under six months post treatment (Arya 2012;
de Sèze 2001; Howe 2005). Data were available for 96.8% (N
= 153) of participants. There was a large effect size, which was
statistically significant: SMD 0.92, 95% CI 0.58 to 1.26 (Analysis
2.1).
Between six and 12 months post treatment
Six trials recruiting 505 participants measured arm function for
retention effects of RTT interventions between six and 12 months
post treatment (Blennerhassett 2004a; Dean 2007; Langhammer
2000; Van Vliet2005; Winstein 2004; Winstein 2016 ). Data were
available for 81.6% (N = 412) of participants. Results showed no
effect of treatment: SMD 0.10, 95% CI -0.09 to 0.30 (Analysis
2.1).
Upper limb function: subgroup analyses
Comparison 3.1: Dosage of task practice
Trials were classified according to whether they provided zero to
20 hours of therapy (nine trials), or more than 20 hours of therapy
(six trials). The difference between groups did not reach statistical
significance (Chi2 = 0.39, df = 1, P = 0.53) (Analysis 3.1).
Comparison 3.2: Time since stroke
Trials were classified according to whether they recruited within
15 days post stroke (four trials), 16 days to six months post stroke
(seven trials), or more than six months post stroke (four trials). The
difference between the groups did not reach statistical significance
(Chi2 = 1.16, df = 2, P = 0.56) (Analysis 3.2).
Comparison 3.3: Type of intervention
Trials were classified according to whether they were whole therapy
approaches (three trials), mixed task training (eight trials), or single
task training (four trials). The difference between the groups did
not reach statistical significance (Chi2 = 4.01, df = 2, P = 0.13)
(Analysis 3.3).
Lower limb function: post treatment
Results are presented for 1) walking distance, 2) walking speed,
3) functional ambulation, 4) sit-to-stand, 5) lower limb function,
and 6) standing balance/reach. All results are post therapy, except
for Langhammer 2000, which is three months post stroke, and
Van Vliet 2005, which is three months post baseline.

 Comparison 4.1: Walking distance: change from baseline
Nine trials recruiting 638 participants measured walking distance
(Blennerhassett 2004b; Dean 2000; Gordon 2013; Kim 2014;
Kim 2016; Mudge 2009; Park 2011; Salbach 2004a; van de Port
2012). Data were available for 95.6% (N = 610) of participants.
Change from baseline scores are presented. Using a random-effects
model because of significant heterogeneity in treatment effects,
results were statistically significant: mean difference (MD) 34.80,
95% CI 18.19 to 51.41 (Analysis 4.1, GRADE: moderate quality).
In effect, participants in the experimental groups could walk on
average 35 metres further in six minutes than those in the control
groups.
Comparison 4.2: Walking speed
Twelve trials recruiting 748 participants measured walking speed,
with data available for 91.6% (N = 685) of participants (Dean
1997; Dean 2000; Dean 2007; Frimpong 2014; Kim 2014;
Kwakkel 1999a; Lennon 2009; Olawale 2011; Park 2011; Salbach
2004a; van de Port 2012; Van Vliet 2005). Results were not sta-
tistically significant: SMD 0.39, 95% CI -0.02 to 0.79 (Analysis
4.2, GRADE: low quality).
Comparison 4.3: Functional ambulation
Eight trials recruiting 592 participants measured functional ambu-
lation, with data available for 88.7% (N = 525) of participants (de
Sèze 2001; Frimpong 2014; Kwakkel 1999a; Langhammer 2000;
McClellan 2004; Park 2011; van de Port 2012; Van Vliet 2005).
Results indicated a statistically significant effect: SMD 0.35, 95%
CI 0.04 to 0.66 (Analysis 4.3, GRADE: moderate quality).
Comparison 4.4: Sit-to-stand: post treatment/change from
baseline
Seven trials recruiting a total of 397 participants included a
measure of sit-to-stand, with data available for 87% (N = 346)
(Barreca 2004; Blennerhassett 2004b; Dean 2000; Howe 2005;
Langhammer 2000; Salbach 2004a; Van Vliet 2005). Results were
significant overall: SMD 0.35, 95% CI 0.13 to 0.56 (Analysis 4.4).
Comparison 4.5: Lower limb functional measures
Five trials recruiting 473 participants included a measure of lower
limb function, with data available for 88.6% (N = 419) of par-
ticipants (Blennerhassett 2004b; Dean 2000; Langhammer 2000;
van de Port 2012; Van Vliet 2005). Results overall showed a small
but statistically significant effect size: SMD 0.29, 95% CI 0.10 to
0.48 (Analysis 4.5, GRADE: low quality).
Comparison 4.6: Standing balance/reach
Nine trials recruiting 520 participants measured standing balance
or functional reach, with data available for 96.9% (N = 504) (de
Sèze 2001; Holmgren 2010; Kim 2012; Kim 2016; McClellan
2004; Park 2011; Salbach 2004a; Tung 2010; van de Port 2012).
Results showed a small but statistically significant effect size: SMD
0.24, 95% CI 0.07 to 0.42 (Analysis 4.6).
Lower limb function: follow-up
Comparison 5.1: all outcomes
Less than six months post treatment
Eight trials recruiting 496 participants measured some aspect of
lower limb function for retention effects of RTT interventions
under six months post treatment (de Sèze 2001; Dean 2000;
Holmgren 2010; Howe 2005; Lennon 2009; McClellan 2004;
Mudge 2009; van de Port 2012). Data were available for 95.0% (N
= 471) of participants. Effects across trials were homogeneous (I2 =
6%). Results showed a moderate effect size which was statistically
significant: SMD 0.34, 95% CI 0.16 to 0.52 (Analysis 5.1).

from 16 trials providing 20 hours training or less: SMD 0.39, 95%
CI 0.07 to 0.71. However, the difference in effects between these
subgroups was not statistically significant (Chi2 = 0.08, df = 1, P
= 0.77) (Analysis 6.1).

 Comparison 6.2: Time since stroke
The analysis suggests that size of the effect on lower limb function
is the same whether recruitment to training is within 15 days post
stroke (five trials): SMD 0.16, 95% CI -0.15 to 0.46, from 15
days to six months of stroke (nine trials): SMD 0.52, 95% CI -
0.03 to 1.07, or more than six months post stroke (10 trials): SMD
0.41, 95% CI 0.21 to 0.60. There was no statistically significant
difference between subgroups (Chi2 = 2.29, df = 2, P = 0.32)
(Analysis 6.2).
Comparison 6.3: Type of intervention
Results for single task (five trials): SMD 0.07, 95% CI -0.42 to
0.55, and whole therapy approaches (two trials): SMD 0.10, 95%
CI -0.24 to 0.43 were not statistically significant . Mixed training
(17 trials) had a moderate and statistically significant effect: SMD
0.42, 95% CI 0.17 to 0.67. There was no statistically significant
difference between subgroups (Chi2 = 3.16, df = 2, P = 0.21)
(Analysis 6.3).
Secondary outcomes
Results are presented for 1) ADL function, 2) global motor func-
tion, 3) quality of life/health status, and 4) adverse events.
Comparison 7.1: Activities of daily living (ADL) function
Eleven intervention-control pairs, recruiting a total of 616 partic-
ipants, used a measure of ADL with data available for 85.5% (N =
527) (de Sèze 2001; Gordon 2013; Holmgren 2010; Kim 2016;
Kwakkel 1999a; Kwakkel 1999b; Langhammer 2000; Ross 2009;
Salbach 2004a; Salbach 2004b; Van Vliet 2005). Kwakkel 1999
comprises the combined results for the upper and lower limb train-
ing groups compared against a splint control group, based on the
assumption that effect sizes are similar for the two intervention-
control pairs. The data presented for Salbach 2004 are the results
for the lower limb training group compared against the upper limb
training attention control group (Salbach 2004a). Overall results
indicated a small effect size that was statistically significant: SMD
0.28, 95% CI 0.10 to 0.45 (Analysis 7.1).
Comparison 7.2: Global motor function
Five trials, recruiting a total of 269 participants measured global
motor function (Kim 2014; Langhammer 2000; Peurala 2009;
Tung 2010; Van Vliet 2005). Results were available for 82.5% (N
= 222) of participants and indicated a small to moderate effect
size; this was statistically significant: SMD 0.38, 95% CI 0.11
to 0.65 (Analysis 7.2, GRADE: moderate quality). There were
too few trials to undertake planned subgroup analyses for global
functional outcomes.
Comparison 7.3: Quality of life/health status
Four intervention-control pairs recruiting 305 participants used a
measure of quality of life or health status, with data available for
86.6% (N = 264) (Barreca 2004; Gordon 2013; Kwakkel 1999;
Langhammer 2000). All results are post therapy except Kwakkel
1999, which was measured at 26 weeks. There was a small effect
size, which was statistically significant: SMD 0.28, 95% CI 0.04
to 0.53 (Analysis 7.3).
Adverse events
One trial of sit-to-stand training presented data for the number
of falls: intervention group 3/25 (12%) versus control group 4/23
(17.4%), OR 0.65, 95% CI 0.13 to 3.27 (Barreca 2004). In one
trial of an intensive lower limb exercise programme, 11 partici-
pants in total fell during the study (32%), five in the intervention
group and six in the attention control group (Holmgren 2010).
Fall frequency was reported as 1.35 falls per person per year. Three
participants in each group (18%) fell more than once; the most
falls for any single subject was six. In the FIT-Stroke trial, 29 falls
were reported in the circuit training group and 26 in the usual
physiotherapy group (P = 0.93) (van de Port 2012). Two serious
adverse events were reported in the circuit training group: one
participant fell and consulted a GP and one patient experienced
arrhythmias during one session.
In one trial of an upper limb intervention there were 168 serious
adverse events involving 109 participants (Winstein 2016). The
most common were hospitalisation (N = 143, 25% of randomised
participants) and recurrent stroke (N = 42, 9% of randomised
participants). Adverse events were not presented by trial arm.
Two trials narratively reported no adverse effects (de Sèze 2001;
McClellan 2004). In Salbach 2004, intervention-related reasons
for withdrawal that could be interpreted as adverse events included
one participant out of 47 in a mobility training group who expe-
rienced the onset of groin pain. Four participants also fell during
the mobility intervention but did not suffer injury and contin-
ued to participate in the group. Two falls also occurred during
evaluation. No other trials reported intervention-related reasons
for withdrawal, however one study reported a withdrawal due to
“disinterest” in the intervention group and one withdrawal who
did not like the group sessions in the comparison group (Mudge
2009).

Summary of main results
Upper limb function/sitting balance
There was evidence for the effectiveness of repetitive task train-
ing (RTT) on arm function (SMD 0.25, 95% CI 0.01 to 0.49;
GRADE: low quality), hand function (SMD 0.25, 95% CI 0.00 to
0.51; GRADE: low quality), and sitting balance/functional reach
(SMD 0.28, 95% CI 0.01 to 0.55; GRADE: low quality). There is
evidence the effect was maintained up to six months post therapy
(SMD 0.92, 95% CI 0.58 to 1.26), but not between six months
and one year post therapy (SMD 0.10, 95% CI -0.09 to 0.30).
Treatment effects were not modified by dosage of task practice,
type of intervention, or time since stroke.
Results for arm and hand function are no longer significant when
studies with unclear or poor allocation concealment are removed
from the analysis; removing studies with a usual care comparison
also changes the direction of significance. Results for sitting bal-
ance/reach are no longer significant when one study with addi-
tional therapy time is removed.
One study appears to be an outlier, with a much larger treatment
effect on arm function than other studies in the comparison (Arya
2012). This may be explained by the inclusion of participants with
less severe stroke (National Institute of Health Stroke Scale score <
14) and participants able to participate in “intensive exercise”. The
study also reported received intensity of intervention (around 55
minutes per session for the intervention group); this information
was rarely reported and it is therefore uncertain whether the spec-
ified level of intervention was achieved in the majority of studies.
Lower limb function/standing balance
There was evidence for a statistically significant small to moderate
impact of RTT training on walking distance (MD 34.80, 95% CI
18.19 to 51.41; GRADE: moderate quality), sit-to-stand (SMD

 0.35, 95% CI 0.13 to 0.56) and functional ambulation (SMD
0.35, 95% CI 0.04 to 0.66; GRADE: moderate quality). There
was also evidence of effect on lower limb functional measures
(SMD 0.29, 95% CI 0.10 to 0.48; GRADE: low quality), and
standing balance/reach (SMD 0.24, 95% CI 0.07 to 0.42). Results
at follow-up were statistically significant at up to six months post
therapy (SMD 0.34, 95% CI 0.16 to 0.52), but not up to one
year post therapy (SMD 0.06, 95% CI -0.18 to 0.31). There is
no evidence to suggest task training is more effective if delivered
within 15 days, between 16 days and six months, or more than
six months after stroke. Effects of larger versus smaller amounts of
training also did not reach statistical significance (P = 0.77); type
of training (whole therapy, mixed training or single task training)
also did not reach statistical significance (P = 0.21), however the
sample size for single task training (112) and whole therapy (138)
was comparatively small.
Results for functional ambulation, lower limb functional mea-
sures, and standing balance/reach were no longer significant when
studies with a usual care comparison were removed. Removing
studies with additional therapy time changed results to non-sig-
nificant for functional ambulation, lower limb functional mea-
sures, and standing balance/reach. Results for functional ambula-
tion and lower limb functional measures also became non-signif-
icant when studies delivering the intervention in a group setting
were removed.
One recent study appears to be an outlier, with a larger effect on
walking speed and functional ambulation than other studies in
these comparisons (Frimpong 2014). Possible explanations could
be the small sample size (20 participants in total) and poor study
quality: insufficient details were provided for all risk of bias ele-
ments. Removing this study from the analysis does not change the
direction of statistical significance in either comparison.
Secondary outcomes
For the five trials using global motor function measures, there
was a small effect on global motor function (SMD 0.38, 95% CI
0.11 to 0.65) (Kim 2014; Langhammer 2000; Peurala 2009; Tung
2010; Van Vliet 2005). There was a small, statistically significant
effect on activities of daily living (ADL) (SMD 0.28, 95% CI
0.10 to 0.45) and perceptions of quality of life/healthstatus (SMD
0.28, 95% CI 0.04 to 0.53). There was insufficient evidence to be
certain of the risk of adverse events.
Overall completeness and applicability of
evidence
The included trials were clinically diverse in focus and there are
gaps in the evidence base, particularly for people who are more
than six months post stroke. Only four trials evaluated the impact
of RTT on upper limb function in people more than six months
post stroke: three trials for 20 hours or less (Dean 1997; Mudge
2009; Salbach 2004b), and two for more than 20 hours (Ross
2009; Yen 2005). Only five trials evaluated the impact of more
than 20 hours of RTT on upper limb function in people zero
to six months post stroke (Arya 2012; Kwakkel 1999b; Turton
1990; Winstein 2016). More trials have focused on the impact
of RTT on lower limb function, but there are also gaps in the
evidence, with only six trials evaluating more than 20 hours lower
limb training in people zero to six months post stroke (Holmgren
2010; Kim 2016; Kwakkel 1999a; McClellan 2004; Peurala 2009;
van de Port 2012 ).
Although we were unable to classify participants into more dis-
abled or less disabled participant subgroups, the Characteristics of
included studies table illustrates the wide range of disability levels
of the participants within the included trials. However, many of
the trialshadinclusioncriteriaspecifyingeitherminimum,ormin-
imum and maximum levels of ability, motivation to participate,
and ability to understand instruction. The evidence provided by
the review therefore appears to be widely applicable, perhaps with
the exception of very severely disabled people with little postu-
ral control or voluntary movement, those with very mild deficits,
and those with severe communication difficulties. Seven of the 33
included studies (Howe 2005; Holmgren 2010; Kwakkel 1999;
Lennon 2009; Ross 2009; van de Port 2012; Van Vliet 2005) re-
ported stroke subtype using the Oxfordshire Community Stroke
Project classification tool (Bamford 1991).
The acceptability and safety of RTT to all types of participants
is unclear. While there were few adverse effects reported overall,
the lack of formal reporting means this finding is inconclusive.
Of the information provided about reasons for dropouts in the
trials, the most frequent cause was physical illness, and only a very
small proportion of those participating dropped out for physical
reasons that might have been related to the intervention. There
was also a small number of participants who were lost to follow-
up for reasons related to compliance or treatment preference.
Information about recruitment was not often provided but, of
those that did provide information, a large trial recruiting inpa-
tients early after stroke had a relatively low number of refusals
to participate (for example, Kwakkel 1999 had four out of 101
participants who did not give consent), while a trial recruiting in
the community after rehabilitation had high numbers of refusal
of the intervention (Salbach 2004a had 73% refusal). It may be
that some forms of intervention are less acceptable, or that inter-
ventions only appeal to a subset of stroke survivors, particularly if
travel is involved.
We were unable to reach any conclusions about the impact of
numbers of repetitions as a measure of the intensity of practice, as
this information was rarely provided. The amount of task practice
is therefore a measure of the intervention sessions’ duration rather
than the amount of time spent doing repetitive task practice or
the number of repetitions.
We were also unable to comment on the resource implications
of different sites of treatment, therapist-delivered versus self-de-

 livered interventions, or group versus individual delivery, as there
were too few trials for comparison. However, the presence of three
trials involving self-delivery in the home environment (Holmgren
2010 (last week of the intervention only); McClellan 2004; Turton
1990), and six trials involving group delivery of task-specific train-
ing (Barreca 2004; Blennerhassett 2004; Dean 2000; Kim 2012;
Mudge 2009; van de Port 2012), suggest that these modes of deliv-
ery are feasible. The two studies that collected information showed
generally high levels of satisfaction with the programme (Barreca
2004; Dean 2000). Attendance levels at community programmes
were also very good, suggesting that these training programmes
were well received by those who chose to participate.
Our review aimed to assess whether RTT alone leads to functional
gains in the absence of other mechanisms of action. However, it
could be argued that RTT as an intervention necessarily includes
some additional mechanisms, For example, many of the trials re-
ferred to motor learning principles as the basis for the intervention.
This approach involves a much more complex set of principles
than just task-specific repetition, including targeting to individual
needs, task variation, and particular forms of feedback. Inclusion
of these trials in the review suggests reducing motor learning or
movement science therapies to their lowest common denominator,
but even those trials that did not claim a basis in such approaches
often also included aspects of active learning, task shaping, feed-
back, or individualisation of treatment.
Our definition of RTT, and subsequent decisions about study in-
clusion, have consequences for the applicability of the evidence.
We excluded trials when the repetition described appeared to be
primarily for strength or endurance training, for example cycling
or gait training, and when the type of training appeared divorced
from the functional aim, for example backward walking training,
slot machines, or computer games. By the exclusion of trials of
what could be defined as ’pre-functional’ types of movement, we
will effectively have excluded a group of people who cannot yet
participate in functional movement. The same consequence ap-
plies to the exclusion of trials with a large element of passive and
active-assisted movement.
Since the publication of the original review RTT has become an
established intervention tested in rehabilitation trials. The quality
of reporting of RTT interventions has also greatly improved. As a
consequence, it is likely that new studies included in this update
will more closely resemble the inclusion criteria and definition of
RTT than those included in the original review.
Quality of the evidence
Poor reporting, particularly in the earlier studies, meant the overall
risk of bias was unclear for many studies: only eight out of the 33
trialshadadequate allocationconcealment, however22studieshad
blinded outcome assessment. Many of the trials were small, with
21trialshavinglessthan50participants. The inclusionof pilotand
feasibility trials (five studies) suggests many were not powered to
detectadifference betweeninterventiongroups. Elevenstudiesnot
described as pilot or feasibility trials reported a power calculation;
in a further 13 studies this was not reported.
Potential biases in the review process
When designing the review, we made an early decision to consider
the effect of RTT on upper and lower limb function outcomes
separately, as we thought that there might be a differential impact.
The results of the review support this decision, although there are
two disadvantages. Firstly, we are unable to give an overall effect
estimate for RTT, although considering the different interventions
and objectives of upper and lower limb training this may not have
been a clinically meaningful figure. Secondly, subgroup analyses
are smaller, and therefore less well powered than they would have
been if all trials had been combined. As the number of studies
reported in the subgroup analyses are small, the results should be
treated with caution.
Our major focus in this review was impact on task-specific func-
tion. In practice, we excluded a large number of studies on the ba-
sis that we did not judge the outcomes to be functional, or the in-
tervention to be task-specific. We have also included studies where
our interpretation of the intervention was that repetition of func-
tional movement was a major mechanism of action (for example,
de Sèze 2001). Whether balance training is truly ’functional’ is
also a matter of interpretation.
Although interventions were often well described, it was some-
times difficult to estimate the relative intensity of treatment, espe-
cially within mixed interventions. Information on the number of
repetitions was rarely available. This potentially means that the re-
view is investigating the impact of functional task specificity rather
more than the element of repetition. Our decision was to include
trials if we could clearly identify the amount of practice.
The included trials used a wide range of outcome measures,
methodologies and time intervals for follow-up making summary
statistics difficult. We made strenuous efforts to obtain data suit-
able for pooling for each outcome, but sometimes these were not
available, and the method of pooling less than optimum, such
as the use of standardised mean difference for walking speed. It
would have been better to use outcome changes compared with
baseline, especially for analyses with smaller numbers of partici-
pants, but these were also not available across trials. We also gen-
erally used fixed-effect analyses, which some might criticise due to
the presence of some clinical heterogeneity in the treatments and
trials combined.
The subgroup analysis of trial design (that is, attention control ver-
sus usual care control) did reach statistical significance (P = 0.88).
However, maintaining the upper and lower limb trials separately
meant that further subdivision into type of comparison group was
not feasible.

 Agreements and disagreements with other
studies or reviews
In contrast to the original review, which found no evidence of sig-
nificant benefit from RTT of the upper limb, this update suggests
significant benefit both on arm and hand function, with benefits
sustained at short-term follow-up (up to six months post inter-
vention). However, studies were heterogeneous (I2 58% and 54%
for arm and hand function, respectively). Repetitive task training
of the lower limb found significant benefit on all primary and sec-
ondary outcome measures with the exception of walking speed.
This is in line with recent reviews on physical therapy (Verbeek
2014) and interventions directed at motor recovery after stroke
(Langhorne 2009).
Treatment effects of longer versus shorter amounts of training did
not reach statistical significance for the upper limb, suggesting re-
sults are not moderated by the amount of practice. Upper limb
findings do not support a recent review and meta-analysis of phys-
ical therapy post stroke (Verbeek 2014), suggesting high-intensity
practice (specifically an additional 17 hours therapy time over 10
weeks) is necessary for functional benefit. Findings also do not
support the identified dose-response relationship between amount
of therapy and improved outcome for upper limb training found
in Kwakkel 2004.
For the lower limb, the effect of more than 20 hours of task training
wasgreaterthanthatof zeroto20hourstraining, butthe difference
between subgroups was not significant.(P = 0.77), contrary to the
findings of Van der Lee 2001, where more than 20 hours was found
to be preferable to up to 20 hours of training. A recent review of
physical therapy approaches similarly concluded that in relation
to the dose of intervention, subgroup analysis revealed a dose of
30 to 60 minutes per day delivered five to seven days per week
was effective in terms of independence in ADL (Pollock 2014b).
Results from subgroup analysis suggest further research into the
dose-response relationship in lower limb interventions should be
a priority.
There were small positive effects on global motor function, ADL
and functional ambulation. Even though the amount of change is
small, the clinical benefit of the change in activities of daily living
is likely to be meaningful in relation to quality of life (Van Exel
2004).
In those studies that did show a benefit and provided later assess-
ments, improvements at the end of training were evident in both
upper and lower limb function up to six months post treatment
but not beyond. It is unclear from this review whether this is re-
lated to characteristics of the participants, the intensity of training
or the degree of improvement required before detectable change
was noted.
Evidence from this review does not support the suggestion that
earlier provision of treatment results in greater functional improve-
ment. Improvement in function was possible even in the later
stages of recovery (Page 2004).
In a review of physiotherapy treatments after stroke (Pollock
2014b), it is suggested that research should be conducted to de-
termine the efficacy of clearly described individual techniques and
task-specific treatments. Clear definition of individual techniques
still remains a challenge but this review suggests that focusing on
specific treatments is possible; there are now taxonomies for group-
ing such interventions (e.g. Pollock 2014a). Readers may not agree
with some of our classification of studies, but the review authors
compared all interventions in detail to make these difficult deci-
sions.
The mechanisms of action responsible for any lower limb func-
tional gain are still unclear. Many of the interventions were mixed,
and while all contained repetition and functional practice, they
could also include elements of endurance or strength training.
However, the review of treadmill training found people after stroke
who receive treadmill training with or without body weight sup-
port are not more likely to improve their ability to walk indepen-
dently compared with people after stroke not receiving treadmill
training, but there may be improvement in walking speed and
walking endurance (Mehrholz 2014). Results of a recent review
of robot-aided therapy on arm function found moderate qual-
ity evidence that robotics may be effective in improving upper
limb impairment and ADL outcomes (Mehrholz 2015b). How-
ever, robotics may not be more beneficial than conventional ther-
apy at the same dose. Given that repetition is a major mechanism
of action in both treadmill and robotics, this would suggest that
reflecting real-world task complexity in training is a significant
factor. However, other potential mechanisms of action are also im-
plicit in some of the trial interventions, such as self-efficacy, task-
novelty, and motivation to participate in the interventions deliv-
ered in a group setting.

Implications for practice
The results of this review provide low- or moderate-quality evi-
dence to validate the general principle that repetitive, task-specific
training for lower limbs can result in functional gain when com-
pared against other forms of usual care or attention control. There
is low-quality evidence of improvement in arm and hand function
following repetitive task training (RTT) of the upper limb. Effects
for both upper and lower limb appear to be sustained up to six
months post treatment. Some caution is needed in interpreting the
lack of evidence of adverse effects, as few trials specifically moni-
tored these as outcomes. If task-specific training is used in clinical
practice, adverse effects should be monitored.
Implications for research
Further primary research should be directed towards exploration
of the amount of lower limb task training actually performed, as
26

 opposed to the length of the therapy session, and include num-
ber of repetitions, and how to maintain functional gain after six
months post treatment. It is unclear whether task training accel-
erates recovery or simply improves performance for a finite time
interval. This review provided some evidence of a treatment ef-
fect for upper limb function, although, with the exception of two
studies (Arya 2012; Winstein 2016), sample sizes were small. The
conclusion of this review about evidence for efficacy of task train-
ing for arm function is therefore tentative. More intensive therapy
(over 20 hours) does not appear to be more effective for either the
upper or lower limb.
There were insufficient trials included in the review to evaluate
the efficacy and cost-effectiveness of different intervention deliv-
ery methods for RTT, such as group training, or practice in the
home environment. Further randomised controlled trials should
evaluate practical ways of delivering RTT interventions. In par-
ticular, the acceptability of circuit type training interventions in
community settings needs to be evaluated. Further research should
also address practical ways of maintaining post-therapy functional
gain beyond six months. Future trials should be powered to detect
cost-effectiveness as well as clinical effect, and should include a
quality of life measure as one of the outcomes.
We were unable to investigate the impact on people of different
levels of pre-intervention disability, because of the wide range of
baseline measures used. Analyses of this type would be facilitated
by the inclusion in trials of baseline data using a common measure,
such as the Barthel Index, which can be related to population
norms dependent on time since stroke.
This review did not compare repetitive functional task training
against other interventions not currently viewed as a component
of usual care. Future updates of this review are likely to compare
RTT against other interventions (for example, resistance training,
constraint-induced movement therapy or robotics), or in com-
bination with other interventions (e.g. strength training) rather
than RTT against “usual care”. The definition of RTT will need
revisiting prior to further updates of this review in order to ensure
it remains clinically meaningful and distinguishable from other
interventions (for example, treadmill training, Mehrholz 2014).

Interventions
RTT intervention: Meaningful Task Specific Training (MTST) is a training program
for upper extremity rehabilitation of post stroke clients based on principles of motor
learning, experience dependent neuroplasticity, and shaping techniques
MTST mainly comprises the specific number of meaningful tasks, which are common
to all the patients
The tasks have to be practiced repetitively either with unilateral (the most affected
extremity) or bilateral upper limb/s, depending on the task requirement
It also has a component of individualised meaningful tasks, which have to be selected
from a task bank for repetitive practice
Sessions were delivered as one-to-one outpatient rehabilitation in day care units 1 hour
per day (unclear number of times per week) for 4 weeks
Comparison group: the control group was given an intervention of the same duration
based on the Brunnstrom movement therapy and Bobath neurodevelopmental technique
Outcomes
Outcome measures were recorded at baseline, 4 weeks (post treatment) and 8 weeks
Upper limb functional outcome measures: Fugl-Meyer assessment, Action Research Arm
Test, Graded Wolf Motor Function Test, Motor Activity Log
Notes
No significant differences at baseline
1 experimental dropout due to personal reasons
No adverse events reported

Stroke details: 38 right CVA, 26 left CVA
Timing post stroke: 30.3 ± 28.8 months
Pre-intervention functional activity level: RTT WP MAS mean 26.5 (SD 8.5), RTT PP
28.1 (7.9), control 26.5 (8.9); (MAS score ≥32 designated as “mild”, ≤ 31 designated
“moderate to severe”)
Interventions
RTT intervention: the exercises consisted of practising standing up from a chair, sitting
down, stepping onto a step, stepping off a step, pronation and supination holding a bottle
and reaching and grasping. All participants allocated to an exercise “arm” of the trial
practised the same functional exercises but in different ways: entirety (whole practice) or
component parts (part practice). The clinical research assistant encouraged participants
to increase the number of repetitions of exercises practiced if assessed to be appropriate
The target number of repetitions of each exercise was documented in the exercise diary
and participants were requested to document the actual number undertaken
Comparison group: participants did not receive any physical intervention or exercise
instruction but received the same number of visits by the research assistant to counteract
the possible therapist interaction effect

Interventions
RTT intervention: sitting training protocol designed to improve sitting by reaching
beyond arm’s length using the unaffected hand whilst focusing on: smooth co-ordinated
motion of the trunk and arm to get the hand to the object; appropriate loading of the
affected foot; and preventing the use of maladaptive strategies such as widening the base
of support. While reaching beyond arm’s length, reach distance, direction, thigh support,
seat height, and task were varied systematically. Training was progressed over the 2-week
period by increasing the reach distance and the number of repetitions
Sessions were delivered to individuals by the first or second author or undergraduate
physiotherapy students
Comparison group: sham training protocol; participants completed a series of 11 cogni-
tive-manipulative tasks Participants were seated at a table, well supported in a chair with
back and armrests, with their forearms resting on the table. The workspace was confined
so that reach distance was less than 50% of arm’s length which minimised perturbations
to balance. Training was progressed over the 2-week period by increasing the number of
repetitions and cognitive difficulty of the cognitive-manipulative tasks
Both training programmes were 10 sessions of 30 minutes spread over a two week period
= 5 hours
Outcomes
Outcomes were recorded at baseline, 2 weeks (post treatment) and 28 weeks
Upper limb functional outcome measures: Functional Reach Test (primary outcome);

Interventions
RTT intervention: the intervention was based on the HIFE (High Intensity Functional
Exercise) program, to improve the participants lower-limb strength, balance and gait
ability
The program includes lower-limb strength (e.g. chair stand) and balance exercises (e.
g. weight shifting outside support surface), standing (e.g. knee bend) and walking (e.g.
obstacle crossing course)
A home visit was conducted by a physiotherapist and an occupational therapist to deter-
mine each participant’s ability to perform ADLs and lifestyle activities and to experience
the participants daily difficulties in their own environment
Sessions were 45 minutes, 6 times per week (twice daily) for 5 weeks = 22.5 hours
Comparison group: participants met once per week for a 1 hour of educational session
during the 5-week period
The session was led by an occupational therapist, group discussions were about com-
munication difficulties, fatigue, depressive symptoms, mood swings, personality changes
and dysphagia, all more or less hidden dysfunctions after stroke and how to cope with
these difficulties
There was no special focus on the risks of falling in these discussions
Outcomes
Outcomes were recorded at baseline, 5 weeks (post treatment), 3 months and 6 months
Balance/sit-to-stand outcome measures: Berg Balance Scale, Falls Efficacy Scale, number
of falls
ADL outcome measures: Barthel Index, Frenchay Activities Index
Notes

Notes
Baseline characteristics were similar in terms of age, gender, side of hemiplegia, time
since stroke onset, stroke severity and walking speed
There was insufficient contrast in treatment between the groups (i.e. therapists in the
Bobath group practiced early ambulation more frequently than therapists in the RTT
group)
Within the RTT group, there were three times the number of Total Anterior Circulation
Infarct strokes (a poor prognostic indicator for recovery of independent mobility), more
participants with a previous stroke and more participants requiring the assistance of 2
people to walk

Pre-intervention functional ability level: all participants could walk, but with difficulty
Interventions
RTT intervention: home-based exercise programme aimed at improving mobility in
standing balance and walking, based on a list of 23 activities arranged hierarchically on
their challenge to balance
The home programme used video self-modelling prepared on the baseline visit to the
clinic to prescribe the exercise programme, telephone monitoring to encourage compli-
ance, and 2 clinic visits for programme review
Sessions were prescribed 60 minutes per day over 6 weeks = 42 hours
Participants were required to keep a record of practice
Comparison group: home-based exercise programme of same duration based on improv-
ing upper limb function, starting from basic movement through to functional activity,
using the same self-instructional video, self- and telephone-monitoring and clinic visits
as the experimental group
Outcomes
Outcomes were recorded at baseline, 6 weeks (post treatment) and 14 weeks
Lower limb functional outcome measures: MAS - walking
Balance/sit-to-stand outcome measures: Functional Reach Test
Notes
No baseline comparisons reported
19% lost to follow-up by end of treatment phase
No likely intervention-related reasons for withdrawal
Participants reported 75% compliance with prescribed exercises

58 participants: 31 RTT, 27 control
Participants were recruited through the Stroke Foundation of New Zealand, stroke clubs
and the local hospital stroke service between June 2007 and February 2008
Inclusion criteria: 1 or more strokes more than 6 months earlier, had been discharged
from rehabilitation, and were able to walk independently (with an aid if necessary). Some
residual gait difficulty was required, as defined by a score of less than 2 on at least 1 of
the walking items of the physical functioning scale of the 36-Item Short Form Health
Survey
Exclusion criteria: progressive neurologic disease, other significant health problems that
adversely affected walking ability, more than 2 falls in the previous 6 months, unstable
cardiac conditions, uncontrolled hypertension, or congestive heart failure
Mean age: RTT 69.8 (SD 13.12), control 69.61 (SD 12.81)

of the 36-item Short Form Health Survey: RTT 19, control 17
Interventions
RTT intervention: the circuit exercise groups contained up to 9 participants and were
led by 1 of the investigators, assisted by 2 physiotherapy students. There were 15 sta-
tions in the circuit, which were graded to each participant’s ability and progressed as
tolerated. Each station contained either a task-oriented gait or standing balance activity,
or strengthening of a lower extremity muscle in a way designed to improve gait (e.g. sit-
to-stand, self-sway, standing balance, step-ups, balance beam, standing hamstring curl,
tandem walk, Swiss ball squats, tandem stance, calf raise, backward walk, lunges, side

although sessions lasted between 50 to 60 minutes, including stretching, sessions were
3 times per week for 4 weeks = 6 hours of RTT
Comparison group: participants in the control group attended eight 90-minute sessions
over 4 weeks in groups of up to 8. The control group was run by an occupational therapist
and consisted of 4 social and 4 educational sessions. The duration of the control group
sessions was designed to match the duration of the intervention sessions in order to

Interventions
RTTintervention: oneach dayof treatment/training, participants observeda pre-exercise
rest period of 10 minutes during which heart rate and blood pressure measurements were
made. The RTT group went through a 1-hour session of conventional physiotherapy
including 25 minutes of overground walking exercise training. The overground walking
exercise training involved walking over ground at a natural safe speed (i.e. walking at
own pace in order to cover as much ground as possible within the training period) on
a 15 x 10 metre walk course marked out on the flat floor of a remedial gymnasium. In
each case, exercise would be terminated any time the participant reported symptoms of
exertional intolerance, i.e. outside the target zone on Borg’s rate of perceived exertion
(RPE) scale. Participants took part in 3 x 25 minute sessions per week for a 12-week
period = 15 hours
Comparison group: the conventional physiotherapy rehabilitation consisted of 1 hour
of active and passive range of motion (ROM) exercises, strength training and balance
training, as applicable

25 participants, 13 RTT, 12 control
Participants were recruited from people receiving inpatient management service in a
rehabilitation hospital. Date of recruitment not reported
Inclusion criteria: the first stroke had occurred 6 months to five years before the study, a
walking speed of 50.7 m/s, which indicates unsafe community ambulation, no auditory
or visual deficits, no orthopaedic or cardiovascular conditions that may interfere with
the study, no cognitive impairment (> 25 in Mini-Mental State Examination)
Exclusion criteria: none stated
Mean age: RTT 59.38 years (SD 8.46), control 56.92 years (SD 7.79)
48% male
Stroke details: 60% ischaemic, 44% right hemiparesis

Pre-intervention functional ability level: Walking Aids: no aid (n = 7), ankle foot orthosis
(n = 0), cane (n = 13), quadruped cane (n = 4), ankle foot orthosis + quadruped cane (n
= 1)
Interventions
RTT intervention: participants from the experimental group underwent 1-hour sessions
of community-based ambulation training in addition to functional training. The com-
munity-based ambulation training programme consisted of 4-phase walking training
performed in various community situations, which were differently applied according to
a weekly schedule. The difficulty level of the walking training was increased every week,
with different environmental demands in each session. During the 4-week training pe-
riod, walking training was conducted at various locations (e.g.in the foyer of a hospital, a
pavement, stairs, a ramp, a car park, a pedestrian crossing, and a shopping centre), with
progressive changes in the environmental demands. These sessions were conducted 3 x
per week for a 4-week period = 12 hours
Comparison group: functional training based on the Bobath concept daily for an hour,
according to the routine schedule of the rehabilitation unit. The functional training
consisted of standing up from a sitting position, therapist-guided movement of the trunk
and lower limb to simulate normal walking pattern, forward and backward stepping of
affected and unaffected lower limb, and stair climbing

Pre-intervention functional ability level: Scandinavian Stroke Scale: RTT 36.2 (SD 11.
7), control 39.8 (SD 8.7)
Interventions
RTT intervention: all hand training was based on the principles of task-specific motor
training and included repetitive practice of tasks which were individualised to the func-
tional goals of each participant. Training was closely supervised on a 1-to-1 basis by 1
of a small number of experienced therapists The amount of actual practice performed
in each session was carefully monitored, for this purpose a stopwatch was used to record
the time spent performing hand activities. The aim was to achieve at least 45 minutes of
repetitious practice in each session. Sessions were 1-hour with a therapist 5 x per week
for six weeks = 30 hours
Comparison group: both groups continued to receive usual arm care which consisted of
half an hour of motor training for the shoulder and elbow 5 x per week. A cup or splint
was strapped to participants’ hands to standardise inadvertent hand training
Usual care for both groups also consisted of strategies such as slings, wheelchair arm
troughs and positioning programmes. In addition, participants in the control group had
similar hand therapy as participants in the experimental group but for only 10 minutes,
3 x per week
Outcomes

Multicentre RCT
Participants
Netherlands
250 participants: 126 RTT, 124 control
Participants were recruited from 9 rehabilitation centres between June 2008 and De-
cember 2010
Inclusion criteria: eligible people had to have had a verified stroke according to the WHO
definition, be able to walk a minimum of 10 metres without physical assistance (Func-
tional Ambulation Categories ≥ 3), be discharged home from a rehabilitation centre,
need to continue physiotherapy during outpatient care to improve walking competency
or physical condition, or both and be able to give informed consent and be motivated
to participate in a 12 week intensive programme of physiotherapy
Exclusion criteria: cognitive deficits as evaluated by the Mini Mental State Examination
(< 24 points), were unable to communicate (< 4 points on the Utrechts Communicatie
Onderzoek, UCO) or lived more than 30 km from the rehabilitation centre
Mean age: RTT 56 years (SD 10), control 58 years (SD 10)
64.8% male
Stroke details: 81.2% (n = 103) ischaemic, 47.2% (n = 118) right hemisphere
Time since stroke: RTT 91 days (SD 42), control 103 days (SD 51)
Pre-intervention functional ability level: Six Minute Walk Test: RTT 339 metres (SD
120), control 306 metres (SD 135)
Interventions
RTT intervention: the training included 8 different workstations, intended to improve
meaningful tasks relating to walking competency such as balance control, stair walking,
turning, transfers and speed walking. At each workstation, participants worked together
in pairs, while 1 participant performed the task for 3 minutes, the other observed their
performance. Each participant’s performance (such as counts) was recorded in a training
log, which was used as a feedback and motivational tool during the next sessions. Moti-
vational music was played in the background during the entire training session. The total
FIT-Stroke programme included four stages: warming up (5 minutes), circuit training
(60 minutes), evaluation and a short break (10 minutes), and group game (15 minutes)
. Sessions lasted 90 minutes, twice per week for 12 weeks = 36 hours

Comparison group: same duration of usual outpatient physiotherapy, mainly one-to-
one treatments tailored to the patient with a physiotherapist who had not been on the
circuit training course at one of the participating rehabilitation centres
Sessions designed to improve control of standing balance, physical condition, and walk-
ing competency were provided according to Dutch physiotherapy guidelines
Outcomes
Outcomes were recorded at baseline, 12 weeks (post treatment), and 24 weeks after
completion of training. Lower limb functional outcome measures: Six Minute Walk Test,
functional ambulation, modified stairs test, comfortable walk test, RMI, Stroke Impact
Scale 3.0 mobility domain

outcomes, all analyses were adjusted for these covariates at baseline. 29 falls were reported
in the circuit training group and 26 in the usual physiotherapy group (P = 0.93). 2
serious adverse events were reported in the circuit training group: 1 participant fell and
consulted a GP and 1 experienced arrhythmias during 1 session

of 21 months. Date of recruitment not reported
Inclusion criteria: diagnosis of stroke, referral to physiotherapy
Exclusion criteria: more than 2 weeks post stroke, unconscious on admission, unable to
toilet independently prior to stroke, living more than 25 km from hospital, unable to
tolerate more than 30 minutes of physical tasks required in initial assessment
Mean age: RTT 75 years (SD 9.1), control 73.3 (SD 10.4)

Stroke details: unclear whether first or recurrent stroke included, 51% right hemiparesis
Time since stroke: within 14 days
Pre-intervention functional ability level: RMA - gross function subscale: RTT median 2
(IQR 1 to 6), control median 1 (IQR 1 to 4)
Interventions
RTT intervention: movement science-based therapy based on the principle that skill in
performance is a direct function of the amount of practice. Programme involved use of
everyday objects for functional training, and practice outside of delivered sessions. Inter-
vention was instead of usual care. Participants received a median 23 minutes treatment
by a physiotherapist per week day (IQR 13 to 32 minutes). Median total number of
minutes of treatment was 365 (IQR 140 to 1160), equating to approximately 6 hours
total training time. Treatment was delivered by physiotherapists, occupational therapists
and physiotherapy assistants, in hospital, and as an outpatient after discharge. Treatment
was delivered for as long as needed
Comparison group: Bobath-based therapy
Outcomes
Outcomes were recorded at baseline, 4 weeks, 3 months and 6 months
Lower limb functional outcome measures: RMA, MAS, Six Metre Walk Test
Upper limb functional outcome measures: 10 Hole Peg Test
ADL outcome measures: Barthel Index, Extended ADL
Notes
Control group had higher median scores for Rivermead gross function, and leg and trunk
subscales, and for supine to side lying, supine to sitting, balanced sitting, and sit-to-stand
sections of the MAS; the experimental group had higher median scores for the upper
arm section of the MAS. 29% loss to follow-up at 3 months

Interventions
RTT intervention: practice of 15 to 20 tasks selected from a battery of 50 tasks, with task
shaping (consisting of verbal feedback for small improvements), task selection (based on
needs of individual), and performance assistance in the initial stages if unable to perform
independently. Intervention was instead of usual care. Sessions were 6 hours per day; it
is unclear whether there were 5 or 7 sessions per week. Treatment duration was 2 weeks
= 60 to 84 hours. Sessions were delivered by a physical therapist; it is unclear whether
sessions were group based or individual
Comparison group: regular program of physical therapy including gait training, facilita-
tion, balance training, or occupational therapy; it is unclear how much time the control
group spent in therapy
