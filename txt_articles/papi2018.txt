Summary
Background Evidence is scarce on the relative risk-benefit of inhaled triple therapy, consisting of inhaled corticosteroid, 
long-acting muscarinic antagonist, and long-acting β2-agonist, versus dual bronchodilation for chronic obstructive 
pulmonary disease (COPD). We aimed to compare a single-inhaler triple combination of beclometasone dipropionate, 
formoterol fumarate, and glycopyrronium (BDP/FF/G) versus a single-inhaler dual bronchodilator combination of 
indacaterol plus glycopyrronium (IND/GLY) in terms of the rate of moderate-to-severe COPD exacerbations over 
52 weeks of treatment.
Methods This randomised, parallel-group, double-blind, double-dummy study was done at 187 sites across 
17 countries. Eligible patients had symptomatic COPD, severe or very severe airflow limitation, at least one moderate 
or severe exacerbation in the previous year, and were receiving inhaled maintenance medication. After a 2 week run-
in period with one inhalation per day of IND/GLY (85 μg/43 μg), patients were randomly assigned (1:1), via an 
interactive response technology system, to receive 52 weeks of treatment with two inhalations of extrafine BDP/FF/G 
(87 µg/5 µg/9 µg) twice per day or one inhalation of IND/GLY (85 μg/43 μg) per day. Randomisation was stratified by 
country and severity of airflow limitation. The primary endpoint was the rate of moderate-to-severe COPD 
exacerbations across 52 weeks of treatment in all randomised patients who received at least one dose of study drug 
and had at least one post-baseline efficacy assessment. Safety was assessed in all patients who received at least one 
dose of study drug. This study is registered with ClinicalTrials.gov, number NCT02579850.
Findings Between May, 29 2015, and July 10, 2017, 1532 patients received BDP/FF/G (n=764) or IND/GLY (n=768). 
Moderate-to-severe exacerbation rates were 0·50 per patient per year (95% CI 0·45–0·57) for BDP/FF/G and 
0·59 per patient per year (0·53–0·67) for IND/GLY, giving a rate ratio of 0·848 (0·723–0·995, p=0·043) in favour of 
BDP/FF/G. Adverse events were reported by 490 (64%) of 764 patients receiving BDP/FF/G and 516 (67%) of 
768 patients receiving IND/GLY. Pneumonia occurred in 28 (4%) patients receiving BDP/FF/G versus 27 (4%) patients 
receiving IND/GLY. One treatment-related serious adverse event occurred in each group: dysuria in a patient receiving 
BDP/FF/G and atrial fibrillation in a patient receiving IND/GLY.
Interpretation In patients with symptomatic COPD, severe or very severe airflow limitation, and an exacerbation 
history despite maintenance therapy, extrafine BDP/FF/G significantly reduced the rate of moderate-to-severe 
exacerbations compared with IND/GLY, without increasing the risk of pneumonia.

Introduction
Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) is 
characterised by persistent respiratory symptoms and 
airflow limitation that is usually caused by significant 
exposure to noxious particles or gases.1 Chronic inflam­
mation causes structural changes, narrowing of small 
airways, and destruction of the lung parenchyma, 
resulting in persistent airflow limitation, chronic 
respiratory symptoms, and exacerbations.1 Inhaled triple 
therapy, consisting of a corticosteroid, a long­acting 
β2­agonist, and a long­acting muscarinic antagonist, 
is recommended by the Global Initiative for Obstructive 
Lung Disease for patients who have further exacerbations 
despite dual bronchodilation with a long­acting β2­agonist 
plus a long­acting muscarinic antagonist or a long­acting 
β2­agonist plus an inhaled corticosteroid.1 Triple therapy 
is commonly used in clinical practice,2,3 but there is little 
evidence to support the risk­benefit of triple therapy 
versus dual bronchodilation. In particular, no studies 
have directly compared single­inhaler triple therapy with 
single­inhaler dual bronchodilator therapy for reducing 
exacerbations.
A single­inhaler triple therapy is available consisting 
of an extrafine formulation (ie, with mass median aero­
dynamic diameter <2 µm) of the inhaled corticosteroid 
beclometasone dipropionate (BDP), the long­acting 
β2­agonist formoterol fumarate (FF), and the long­
acting muscarinic antagonist glycopyrronium (G). Two 
previous 52 week studies have already assessed the 
efficacy and safety of this combination: in the TRILOGY

BDP/FF/G 
reduced 
the 
rate 
of 
COPD 
exacerbations by 23% compared with BDP/FF, whereas 
in TRINITY,5 BDP/FF/G reduced the rate of COPD 
exacerbations by 20% compared with the long­acting 
muscarinic antagonist tiotropium.5 In the present 
study, TRIBUTE, we compared the effects of BDP/FF/G 
with those of a single­inhaler combination of the long­
acting β2­agonist indacaterol plus glycopyrronium 
(IND/GLY). We chose IND/GLY as the comparator in 
this study because this combination has shown greater 
efficacy than both long­acting muscarinic antagonist 
monotherapy and the combination of an inhaled 
corticosteroid plus long­acting β2­agonist in terms of 
the rate of moderate­to­severe exacerbations.6,7 We 
aimed to compare BDP/FF/G with IND/GLY in terms 
of the rate of moderate­to­severe COPD exacerbations 
over 52 weeks of treatment.
Methods
Study design
TRIBUTE was a randomised, parallel­group, double­
blind, double­dummy, active­controlled phase 3b study, 
done at 187 sites across 17 countries (appendix). The sites 
were a mixture of primary (n=37), secondary (n=104) and 
tertiary care centres (n=1), and specialised investigation 
units (n=45).
Patients who met the inclusion and exclusion criteria at 
screening (visit 1) had their COPD maintenance therapy 
switched to one inhalation of IND/GLY per day for a 
2 week open­label run­in period (appendix). At the end of 
the run­in (visit 2), patients were randomised 1:1 to either 
continue with IND/GLY or to receive BDP/FF/G.
The study was approved by the ethics committee or 
institutional review board at each site, and was done in 
accordance with the declaration of Helsinki and the 
International Conference on Harmonization Good 
Clinical Practice (ICH/CPMP/135/95). No substantial 
protocol amendments were made that affected any 
randomised patients.
Patients
Eligible patients were aged 40 years or older; current or 
ex­smokers; had a diagnosis of COPD, with a ratio of 
post­bronchodilator (salbutamol 400 µg) forced expiratory 
volume in 1 s (FEV1) to forced vital capacity (FVC) of less 
than 0·7, and severe or very severe airflow limitation 
(FEV1 <50%); had at least one documented moderate 
or severe COPD exacerbation in the previous 12 months; 
were symptomatic at screening, with a COPD Assessment 
Test total score of at least 10; and, for at least 2 months 
before screening had used an inhaled corticosteroid plus 
a long­acting β2­agonist, an inhaled corticosteroid plus 
a long­acting muscarinic antagonist, a long­acting 
β2­agonist plus a long­acting muscarinic antagonist, or 
long­acting muscarinic antagonist monotherapy, but not 
triple therapy. All patients provided written informed 
consent prior to any study­related procedure.
Key exclusion criteria were a current diagnosis of asthma 
with a physician­judged need for inhaled or oral corti­
costeroid therapy for this disorder; clinically significant 
cardiovascular disorders or laboratory abnormalities; and 
unstable concurrent disease that could have affected 
efficacy or safety (as judged by the investigator). The 
full list of inclusion and exclusion criteria is available in 
the appendix.
Randomisation and masking
Patients were randomly assigned to treatment groups by 
central randomisation stratified by country and severity 
of airflow limitation (post­bronchodilator FEV1 categories 
<30% predicted or 30% to <50% predicted) in accordance 
with a randomisation list generated by the interactive 
response technology provider. Patients, investigators, site 
staff, and sponsor personnel were masked to treatment 
Research in context
Evidence before this study
We searched PubMed for articles published before Jan 4, 2018, 
using the search term “Drug Therapy, Combination”[MeSH 
Terms] OR triple AND COPD AND trial, with no limits applied. Of 
the 565 search results, 30 presented data from clinical trials 
investigating the efficacy of triple therapy consisting of an 
inhaled corticosteroid plus a long-acting β2-agonist plus a 
long-acting muscarinic antagonist. Only two of these studies 
included a group receiving a long-acting β2-agonist plus a 
long-acting muscarinic antagonist. One study compared the 
efficacy of triple therapy or dual bronchodilation with that of 
long-acting muscarinic antagonist monotherapy; although 
there were no formal statistical comparisons between triple 
therapy and dual bronchodilation, compared with patients 
receiving dual bronchodilation fewer patients receiving triple 
therapy had an exacerbation during the 1 year follow-up. The 
second study recruited patients who were newly diagnosed 
with COPD following referral for a surgical intervention for 
lung cancer, and who were then randomised to 1 week of 
treatment with triple therapy or dual bronchodilation.
Added value of this study
TRIBUTE is, to our knowledge, the first long-term study to 
specifically compare the effects of triple therapy in a single inhaler 
with those of dual bronchodilation on the rate of exacerbations.
Implications of all the available evidence
Compared with dual bronchodilator therapy, triple therapy 
with an inhaled corticosteroid, a long-acting β2-agonist, and a 
long-acting muscarinic antagonist in a single inhaler reduces 
the rate of COPD exacerbations in patients with symptomatic 
COPD, an FEV1 of less than 50%, and an exacerbation history, 
despite maintenance therapy.

assignment for the duration of the study by use of a 
double­dummy approach, with each patient using both a 
pressurised metered­dose inhaler (containing BDP/FF/G 
or placebo) and a single­dose dry­powder inhaler (placebo 
or IND/GLY).
Procedures
During the run­in phase (starting at visit 1), all patients 
received one inhalation of IND 85 µg/GLY 43 µg 
per day via a single­dose dry­powder inhaler (Ultibro 
Breezhaler, Novartis Europharm, Camberley, UK). After 
random 
isation, patients received 52 weeks of either 
one inhalation of IND 85 µg/GLY 43 µg per day or two 
actuations of extrafine BDP 87 µg/FF 5 µg/G 9 µg 
(corresponding to a nominal dose of 100/6/10 µg) twice 
per day via a pressurised metered­dose inhaler. Placebo 
was delivered with a pressurised metered­dose inhaler 
or a single­dose dry­power inhaler, depending on which 
treatment the patient had been assigned. During the 
52 week treatment period, patients attended visits at 
weeks 4, 12, 26, 40, and 52. As rescue medication, 
patients were permitted to use either salbutamol via a 
pressurised metered­dose inhaler or terbutaline via a 
dry­powder inhaler, but not within 6 h before any 
spirometric assessment. Other non­permitted COPD 
medications are listed in the appendix.
On the morning of the randomisation visit (visit 2), 
baseline (pre­dose) data were collected for spirometry 
(FEV1 and FVC, with centralised spirometry), St George’s 
Respiratory Questionnaire (SGRQ), a measure of health­
related quality of life, and the COPD Assessment Test. At 
each subsequent visit, pre­dose (morning) spirometry 
was done, and SGRQ data were collected. Patients 
recorded daily symptoms in an electronic diary using the 
EXAcerbations of Chronic pulmonary disease Tool 
Patient­Reported Outcome (EXACT­PRO) questionnaire, 
together with study and rescue medication use. Data 
from the COPD Assessment Test were collected at the 
end of the treatment period.
Outcomes
The primary outcome was the rate of moderate­to­severe 
COPD exacerbations over 52 weeks of treatment. The 
secondary efficacy variables were time to first moderate 
or severe exacerbation and time to first severe COPD 
exacerbation; rate of severe and of moderate COPD 
exacerbations; pre­dose FEV1, pre­dose FVC, and SGRQ 
total score at all clinic visits and averaged over the 
treatment period; FEV1 response (change from baseline 
in pre­dose FEV1 ≥100 mL) and SGRQ response (decrease 
from baseline in total score ≥48) at weeks 26 and 52; use 
of rescue medication; EXACT­Respiratory Symptoms 
total score (weighted sum of 11 questions from the 
EXACT­PRO questionnaire);9–11 and COPD Assessment 
Test total score at the end of treatment.
A COPD exacerbation was defined as a sustained 
worsening of respiratory symptoms that required 
treatment with systemic corticosteroids, antibiotics, or 
hospital admission, or any combination thereof.12 Events 
were classified as moderate or severe according to 
European Medicines Agency Committee for Medicinal 
Products for Human Use guidelines,12 with severe 
exacerbations defined as those requiring hospital 
admission or resulting in death. Data from the EXACT­
PRO questionnaire were used by the investigators to 
enhance the recognition of potential exacerbations (in 
the event of worsening symptoms, the e­diary was 
programmed to encourage patients to contact their 
investigator).
Treatment­emergent adverse events (defined as events 
starting on or after first intake of randomised study 
medication) were captured throughout the study. In case 
of clinical features suggesting a diagnosis of pneumonia, 
investigators were asked to undertake, whenever 
possible, further investigations based on their clinical 
experience and judgement. Blood pressure was recorded 
pre­dose and at 10 min post­dose at each visit, with 
electrocardiogram (ECG) data captured pre­dose at 
baseline and weeks 26 and 52.

Statistical analysis
To identify a difference between treatment groups in 
terms of the rate of moderate­to­severe COPD exacer­
bations over 52 weeks of treatment, we estimated that a 
total of 1534 patients (767 per group) would be necessary 
to have 85% power to detect a rate ratio of 0·80 between 
treatments using a negative binomial model, at a two 
sided significance level of 0·05. The sample size 
calculation assumed non­assessable rates for moderate­
to­severe exacerbations to be about 13% at week 12, 
16·5% at week 26, and 20% at Week 52, a rate of 
0·9 exacerbations per patient per year in the IND/GLY 
group, and an overdispersion parameter of 0·56 for the 
negative binomial distribution.
The numbers of moderate­to­severe, moderate, and 
severe COPD exacerbations were analysed with a 
negative binomial model that included treatment, 
country, number of COPD exacerbations in the previous 
year, severity of airflow limitation, and smoking status 
as fixed effects, and log­time in the study as an 
offset. Subgroup analyses of the primary endpoint 
were prespecified (appendix). Time to first exacer­
bation was analysed with a Cox proportional hazards 
model that included the same fixed effects as in the 
primary endpoint analysis; patients not experiencing 
exacerbations were censored at the end of the 
randomised treatment period. A Kaplan­Meier plot was 
also constructed to investigate this variable.
The changes from baseline in pre­dose FEV1, pre­dose 
FVC, SGRQ total score, rescue medication use, and 
EXACT­Respiratory Symptoms total score endpoints 
were analysed with a linear mixed model for repeated 
measures. This model included treatment, visit, 
treatment by visit interaction, country, number of COPD

exacerbations in the previous year, severity of airflow 
limitation, and smoking status at screening as fixed 
effects, and baseline value and baseline by visit 
interaction as covariates. The responder analyses for 
FEV1 and SGRQ were done with a logistic regression 
model that included the same fixed effects as in the 
analysis of the primary endpoint, with the baseline value 
also considered as a covariate. Change from baseline in 
COPD Assessment Test total score was summarised 
descriptively only. No multiplicity adjustments were 
applied in the analyses of secondary endpoints, so the 
p values provided for these endpoints should be 
interpreted descriptively.
The efficacy endpoints were analysed in the 
intention­to­treat (ITT) population, which consisted of 
all patients who underwent randomisation and received 
at least one dose of study drug and had at least one post­
baseline efficacy assessment. As a sensitivity analysis, 
the primary endpoint was also analysed in the per­
protocol population, which contained all patients in the 
intention­to­treat population who had no major protocol 
deviations. Safety outcomes were analysed in all patients 
who received at least one dose of study drug.
All analyses were done with SAS software version 9.3, 
and all p values are two­sided. This study is registered with 
ClinicalTrials.gov, number NCT02579850.
Role of the funding source
The funder of the study was responsible for the design 
and analysis of the study, oversaw its conduct and was 
responsible for the study report preparation. All authors 
had full access to all the data in the study and AP had final 
responsibility for the decision to submit for publication.
Results
The study took place between May 29, 2015, and 
July 10, 2017
. We recruited 2103 patients, of whom 
1532 were eligible to be randomly assigned to one of 
the treatment groups. The study was completed by 
666 (87%) of 764 patients assigned to the BDP/FF/G group 
and 648 (84%) of 768 patients in the IND/GLY group 
(figure 1). Compliance to treatment was high; the median 
of percentage of doses taken was 98·6% in the BDP/FF/G 
group and 98·4% in the IND/GLY group. Baseline 
characteristics of the recruited patients are shown in 
table 1.
The adjusted rates of moderate­to­severe COPD 
exacerbations were 0·50 per patient per year (95% CI 
0·45–0·57) for patients receiving BDP/FF/G and 0·59 
(0·53–0·67) per patient per year for those receiving 
IND/GLY (figure 2). The rate of moderate­to­severe 
COPD exacerbations was significantly lower with 
BDP/FF/G than with IND/GLY, with an adjusted rate 
ratio of 0·848 (95% CI 0·723–0·995; p=0·043), indicating 
a 15% reduction in the exacerbation rate (figure 2).
The per­protocol population results for the primary 
outcome were consistent with those of the ITT population, 
although the rate ratio was not significant (adjusted 
rate ratio 0·849, 0·721–1·000; p=0·050). Prespecified 
subgroup analyses of the primary endpoint are shown in 
the appendix. Among the COPD subgroups defined 
according to the clinical judgement of the investigator, 
patients with chronic bronchitis who received BDP/FF/G 
had a significantly reduced exacerbation rate compared 
with those receiving IND/GLY (0·752, 0·605–0·935, 
p=0·010), whereas the adjusted rate ratios were 0·995 
(0·754–1·314, p=0·974) in patients with emphysema and 
0·939 (0·605–1·459, p=0·781) in those with mixed 
bronchitis and emphysema. BDP/FF/G also significantly 
reduced the exacerbation rate compared with IND/GLY 
in patients with eosinophils of at least 2% (0·806, 
0·664–0·978; p=0·029), with an adjusted rate ratio of 
0·943 (0·711–1·251, p=0·685) in those with eosinophils 
less than 2%. In a second eosinophil subgroup analysis, 
the adjusted rate ratio was 0·806 (0·646–1·007; p=0·057) 
in patients with at least 200 cells per µL and 0·872 
(0·692–1·098, p=0·244) for patients with <200 cells/µL.
The rates of moderate exacerbations and severe 
exacerbations analysed separately were not significantly 
different between BDP/FF/G and IND/GLY, with 
reductions of 13% and 21%, respectively (figure 2). The 
time to first moderate or severe exacerbation was similar 
between the two treatment groups (hazard ratio 0·901, 
95% CI 0·763–1·064, p=0·219) (appendix), as was the 
time to the first severe exacerbation (0·864, 0·613–1·219, 
p=0·405).
Adjusted mean change in FEV1 from baseline was 
significantly larger with BDP/FF/G than with IND/GLY at 
weeks 12 and 40 and when averaged over the treatment 
period (figure 3A). Improvement in mean SGRQ total 
score was significantly better with BDP/FF/G than with

IND/GLY both overall and at all visits (figure 3B). In the 
responder analyses, a numerically higher proportion of 
patients responded to BDP/FF/G than to IND/GLY in 
terms of FEV1 and SGRQ total score change from 
baseline at both Week 26 and 52, although the odds ratios 
were not statistically significant (table 2). The adjusted 
mean changes from baseline in pre­dose FVC were 
similar between the two treatments, although BDP/FF/G 
was superior to IND/GLY at week 40 (appendix). The 
mean changes from baseline in total COPD Assessment 
Test score at the end of treatment, which were sum­
marised descriptively only, were –0·8 with BDP/FF/G 
and –0·6 with IND/GLY.
The use of rescue medication (in terms of puffs per day 
and percentage of days with no use) was not significantly 
different between the two treatment groups (appendix). 
Compared with patients in the IND/GLY group, those in 
the BDP/FF/G group reported a significantly greater 
improvement from baseline in EXACT­Respiratory 
Symptoms score over the first 12 weeks of the study, 
although the two groups were not significantly different 
at subsequent visits (appendix).
The proportion of patients who had adverse events was 
similar between the two groups (table 3), with most events 
being mild or moderate in severity. Pneumonia was 
reported by 28 (4%) patients in the BDP/FF/G group and 
27 (4%) patients in the IND/GLY group; more than 80% of 
these cases were diagnosed on the basis of medical 
imaging (24 [75%] events in the BDP/FF/G group and 
26 [90%] in the IND/GLY group). Similarly, the incidence 
of cardiac adverse events (44 [6%] patients receiving 
BDP/FF/G and 51 [7%] receiving IND/GLY) and serious 
adverse events (11 [1%] patients receiving BDP/FF/G and 
29 [4%] receiving IND/GLY) was low and similar between 
the two groups. One treatment­related serious adverse 
event occurred in each group: dysuria in a patient receiving 
BDP/FF/G and atrial fibrillation in a patient receiving 
IND/GLY. Fewer patients in the BDP/FF/G group had 
adverse events that led to discontinuation of study drug 
than in the IND/GLY group. The most common event 
leading to study drug discontinuation was a COPD 
exacerbation (five patients in the BDP/FF/G group and 
ten patients in the IND/GLY group). Adverse events 
resulted in 37 deaths, none of which were judged to be 
related to study medication. Changes from baseline in 
blood pressure, heart rate, and other ECG parameters were 
small, and did not differ between treatments (appendix).
Discussion
Our results showed that the inhaled corticosteroid­
containing triple combination of extrafine BDP/FF/G 
in a single inhaler was associated with a significantly 
larger reduction in rate of moderate­to­severe COPD 
exacerbations than the dual bronchodilator combination of 
IND/GLY over 52 weeks of treatment, without differences 
in adverse effects, particularly pneumonia.
This study is, to our knowledge, the first to specifically 
compare single­inhaler triple therapy with a fixed

single­inhaler dual broncho 
dilator combination in 
terms of reduction in exacerbations. We recruited 
patients with severe or very severe airflow limitation 
who remained symptomatic despite treatment with one 
or more long­acting bronchodilators (with or without 
inhaled corticosteroid, but no triple therapy) and who 
had at least one moderate­to­severe exacerbation in the 
previous year. TRIBUTE met the primary endpoint, 
showing a signifi 
cant 15% reduction in the rate of 
moderate­to­severe exacerbations with BDP/FF/G com­
pared with IND/GLY. Reductions in both moderate and 
severe exacerbations contributed to the overall result, 
although these reductions were not significant when 
considered separately. However, the study was not 
powered to examine the effect of the treatments on these 
individual endpoints. The relative effect of BDP/FF/G 
versus IND/GLY on moderate­to­severe exacerbations 
was greater in patients with a clinical diagnosis of 
chronic bronchitis and in patients with eosinophils 
greater than 2%; the latter finding is consistent with 
results from several published prespecified and post­
hoc subgroup analyses, in which the effect of inhaled 
corticosteroid (in combination with one or more 
bronchodilators) on exacerbations was more consistent 
in patients with higher blood eosinophil levels.4,5,13,14 
Although the effect of the two treatments was not 
signifi 
cantly different when we used an eosinophil 
threshold of 200 cells per µL, the optimum cutoff for 
blood eosinophils is unclear.15 However, the results from 
these subgroups should be interpreted with caution 
since the study was not powered around these analyses. 
Overall, therefore, this study helps to fill some of the 
evidence gaps in the management of COPD regarding 
the relative efficacy of triple therapy versus a dual 
combination of a long­acting β2­agonist and a long­
acting muscarinic antagonist,16 by showing the benefit 
of adding an inhaled corticosteroid for patients who still 
report exacerbations despite dual bronchodilation.
We selected IND/GLY as the comparator, because it is 
the only combination of a long­acting β2­agonist and a 
long­acting muscarinic antagonist to have previously 
been shown to reduce the rate of COPD exacerbations 
compared with once­daily glycopyrronium and twice­
daily fluticasone plus salmeterol.6,7 The results of the 
study by Wedzicha and colleagues,7 in which there was a 
17% reduction in the rate of moderate­to­severe COPD 
exacerbations with IND/GLY compared with fluticasone 
plus salmeterol,6 supported the recommendation by 
Global Initiative for Obstructive Lung Disease that 
combinations of a long­acting β2­agonist plus a long­
acting muscarinic antagonist should be the first choice 
treatment for patients with COPD who are symptomatic 
and at risk of exacerbations.1 In this context, the further 
15% reduction in exacerbations in TRIBUTE is likely to 
be clinically relevant. Notably, even though all patients 
were receiving two bronchodilators during the study, 
BDP/FF/G was superior to IND/GLY for FEV1 averaged 
over the whole treatment period, although not 
consistently at all individual visits, and patients in the 
BDP/FF/G group had significantly greater improvements 
in health­related quality of life at all visits, together with 
an early improvement in symptoms.
The rate of exacerbations during TRIBUTE was lower 
than the rate reported in the year before the study, a 
pattern that is similar to those seen in previous studies of 
BDP/FF/G with similar inclusion criteria.4,5 This pattern

could be a clinical trial effect, either because of increased 
compliance (both in terms of the study, with more than 
85% of randomised patients completing the study, and to 
treatment, with median compliance in excess of 98%) or 
to more accurate identification of COPD exacerbations 
by expert investigators.
Furthermore, the exclusion from the study of patients 
already on triple therapy means that there was no step 
down in treatment, unlike in other clinical trials,6,7 which 
might increase the risk of exacerbations. Indeed, all 
patients in the triple therapy group (and several in the 
dual bronchodilation group) had a step up in therapy. 
However, although an exacerbation history is associated 
with an increased risk of future exacerbations at a 
population level,17 this association is far from systematic 
at an individual patient level.18,19 As a consequence, 
patients with a history of frequent exacerbations are not 
necessarily all at substantially increased risk of future 
exacerbations, suggesting that the observations in 
TRIBUTE correspond to what can be expected in many 
real­life COPD populations.18,19 Importantly, the high pro­
portion of patients with comorbidities in TRIBUTE 
suggests that the exclusion criteria (which are typical for 
this type of study) did not substantially narrow the 
recruited population, although as in most randomised 
controlled trials, a bias towards less severe comorbid 
diseases might be present. In view of the high level of 
incorrect inhaler technique seen in clinical practice (and 
the impaired outcomes associated with poor technique),20 
the availability of a single inhaler product could be 
especially useful for patients who require triple therapy 
to manage their COPD, especially if it avoids the use of 
two devices of different design.
Finally, the overall adverse event and safety profile of 
BDP/FF/G in TRIBUTE is reassuring, given its consis­
tency with the profile of IND/GLY. The low rate of cardiac 
adverse events in both groups, particularly in the triple 
therapy group, provides further reassurance given 
reports of increased risk of such events in patients with 
COPD who are receiving long­acting bronchodilators,21,22 
especially older patients.23 Results from several studies, 
including the TORCH trial, have shown that the use of 
inhaled corticosteroids by patients with COPD increases 
the risk of pneumonia.24 That a similar proportion of 
patients in the two groups had pneumonia events (more 
than 80% of which were diagnosed on the basis of 
medical imaging) is therefore of interest, since this could 
suggest that the addition of extrafine BDP to a long­
acting muscarinic antagonist plus long­acting β2­agonist 
combination does not increase the risk of pneumonia.
We acknowledge that the study has some limitations. 
First we recruited fewer patients than did similar studies 
that examined the effect of pharmacological interventions 
on COPD exacerbations.6,25 However, TRIBUTE was 
designed and powered specifically to address the first and 
most important question—ie, the effect on moderate­to­
severe exacerbations—for which we showed a sig 
nificant 
reduction with BDP/FF/G. Second, we have considered 
the reasons for a lower observed rate of moderate­to­
severe exacerbations than in the year before study entry, 
and we believe that this lower rate does not diminish the 
importance of the positive results obtained. Finally, since 
we selected IND/GLY as the comparator, the two groups 
received different long­acting β2­agonists, and different 
long­acting muscarinic antagonists, from different 
devices and in different dosing regimens; some of the 
improvements observed could therefore be due to 
differences in molecules, devices or the twice­daily versus 
once­daily dosing regimens.
TRIBUTE addresses an important evidence gap in the 
management of COPD. In patients with symptomatic 
COPD, an FEV1 of less than 50%, and an exacerbation 
history despite maintenance therapy, treatment with the 
extrafine inhaled corticosteroid­containing triple therapy 
regimen of BDP/FF/G was more effective in reducing the 
rate of moderate­to­severe COPD exacerbations than the 
dual bronchodilator combination of IND/GLY, without 
increasing the risk of pneumonia.
