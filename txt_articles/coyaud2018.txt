Summary 
Zika virus (ZIKV) is a membrane enveloped Flavivirus with a positive strand RNA genome, 
transmitted by Aedes mosquitoes (1). The geographical range of ZIKV has dramatically 
expanded in recent decades resulting in increasing numbers of infected individuals, and the spike 
in ZIKV infections has been linked to significant increases in both Guillain-Barré syndrome and 
microcephaly (1). While a large number of host proteins have been physically and/or 
functionally linked to other Flaviviruses, very little is known about the virus-host protein 
interactions established by ZIKV. Here we map host cell protein interaction profiles for each of 
the ten polypeptides encoded in the ZIKV genome, generating a protein topology network 
comprising 3033 interactions amongst 1224 unique human polypeptides. The interactome is 
enriched in proteins with roles in polypeptide processing and quality control, vesicle trafficking, 
RNA processing and lipid metabolism. >60% of the network components have been previously 
implicated in other types of viral infections; the remaining interactors comprise hundreds of new 
putative ZIKV functional partners. Mining this rich dataset, we highlight several examples of 
how ZIKV may usurp or disrupt the function of host cell organelles, and uncover an important 
role for peroxisomes in ZIKV infection.

Introduction 
 
Zika virus (ZIKV) is a mosquito-borne (Aedes aegypti and Ae. Albopictus) single-stranded 
positive sense RNA arbovirus of the Flaviviridae family (2). Named after its discovery in the 
Zika forest of Uganda in 1947 (3), ZIKV remained confined to Africa until recent outbreaks in 
Micronesia (2007) (4), French Polynesia (2013) (5) and South America (2015-2016) (6, 7). Local 
transmission of ZIKV has now been reported in >50 countries (8). 
 
Most ZIKV infections are asymptomatic, though ~20% of infected individuals develop flu-like 
symptoms (rash, fever, joint pain) that resolve after a few days. Notably, however, ZIKV can 
infect human neural progenitors and post-mitotic neurons (9, 10). Consistent with these 
observations, recent ZIKV outbreaks have been linked to significant increases in Guillain-Barré 
syndrome ((11) an autoimmune disorder affecting neuromuscular function) and microcephaly 
(12-15), leading the WHO to declare a Public Health Emergency of International Concern. To 
date, no antiviral drugs or vaccines are available for the treatment or prevention of ZIKV 
infection.  
 
Phosphatidylserine receptors of the TIM (T-cell immunoglobulin and mucin domain) and TAM 
(TYRO, AXL, MER) families are candidate ZIKV receptors (16, 17). Following receptor 
binding, virus endocytosis and vesicle acidification, the 10.7 kb RNA genome is released into the 
host cell cytoplasm. A single polyprotein is translated from this RNA, then proteolytically 
cleaved into three structural (Capsid: C; precursor membrane protein: PreM; Env: Envelope) and 
seven non-structural (NS) polypeptides (NS1, 2A, 2B, 3, 4A, 4B and 5) (18, 19). Viral particle 
  
5 
assembly occurs in the endoplasmic reticulum, following a dramatic reorganization of host 
endomembranes (reviewed in (20)). 
 
sh/siRNA and CRISPR-Cas9-based screens have identified a number of host factors required for 
ZIKV infection and replication (21-23). Importantly, however, very little is known regarding 
individual ZIKV protein - host protein interactions. Here, we present a BioID/IP-MS ZIKV-host 
interactome. Overall, the interactome is significantly enriched in proteins associated with 
polypeptide processing and quality control, vesicle trafficking, RNA processing machinery and 
proteins linked to lipid metabolism. Notably, the dataset also highlights extensive organellar 
targeting by ZIKV proteins. For example, we report that: (i) the ZIKV Capsid protein is targeted 
to a variety of host endomembrane locations, and can “remodel” nuclear/ER membranes; (ii) the 
NS5 helicase protein is targeted to, and partially disrupts, Cajal Bodies; (iii) the NS3-NS2B 
protease interacts with the HOPS/CORVET complex, and modifies lysosome volume, and; (iv) 
NS2A is specifically targeted to peroxisomal membranes. Consistent with this observation, we 
demonstrate that peroxisome function is linked to efficient ZIKV replication in culture. Together, 
the ZIKV-host interactome thus provides a valuable resource for better understanding ZIKV 
biology, and identifies numerous virus-host protein interactions that could be targeted in antiviral 
therapeutic strategies.

Experimental Procedures 
Experimental Design and Statistical Rationale 
Both BioID and anti-Flag IP-MS analyses were performed on each of the ten ZIKV 
polypeptides, expressed individually in HEK293 T-REx cells, fused either with an N-terminal 
FlagBirA* or a C-terminal BirA*Flag epitope tag. MS samples prepared from two biological 
replicates were each analyzed twice (i.e. four MS runs) on a Thermo Q-Exactive HF quadrupole-
Orbitrap mass spectrometer. For each prey protein, all four sample runs were compared against 
the two highest peptide counts amongst 16 control samples, prepared from HEK293 T-REx cells 
expressing the FlagBirA* tag alone (see below). Protein IDs with at least two unique peptides 
and an iProphet score >0.9 (corresponding to ~1% FDR) were defined as high-confidence 
interactors, when their Bayesian False Discovery Rate (BFDR) assigned by SAINT Express 
(v3.6) was below 1% (table S1). Additional details provided below. 
 
Cell lines, virus and transfection. Individual ZIKV polypeptide sequences were generated 
by gene synthesis (BioBasics; based on Genbank sequence ANO46305.1, and cleavage sites 
reported in (18); full sequence information available on Prohits-web.lunenfeld.ca), and 
subcloned using AscI/NotI sites into pcDNA5.1 FRT/TO FlagBirA*- (N-terminal tagging), 
FRT/TO -BirA*Flag (C-terminal tagging), pcDNA3 GFP-, or pcDNA3 mCherry- plasmids. 
FAM134B was amplified with Q5 polymerase (NEB) from HEK293 cDNA, with the following 
primers: KpnI-Fwd: TATAGGTACCATGGCGAGCCCGGCGCCTCCGG and FLAG-
AscI_Rev 
AAGGCGCGCCTTACTTGTCGTCATCGTCTTTGTAGTCGGCATGGCCTCCCAGCA 
GATTTG, and inserted into pcDNA3. Epitope-tagged ZIKV coding vectors were transfected 
  
7 
with PolyJet (Signagen), and expressed in human Flp-In T-REx 293 cells (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, 
CA) or HeLa cells (as described in (24)). Protein expression was induced by adding 1 ug/ml 
tetracycline to the culture medium (DMEM, 10% fetal calf serum, Gibco) for 24hrs. 293 T-REx 
cells were maintained at 37°C in DMEM supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum, 10 mM 
HEPES (pH 8.0) and 1% penicillin-streptomycin. HeLa cells were cultured under the same 
conditions. Human fibroblasts were cultured in DMEM with L-glutamine (Wisent) supplemented 
with 10% fetal bovine serum (Gibco) at 37°C in humidified air with 5% CO2. Vero cells were 
cultured in MEM with L-glutamine supplemented with 5% fetal bovine serum at 37°C and 5% 
CO2. ZIKV (ZIKV/Homo sapiens/PRI/PRVABC59/2015, Genbank accession no. KX087101.2) 
was amplified in Vero cells using MEM supplemented with L-glutamine and 1% fetal bovine 
serum. Plasmids were transfected using Lipofectamine-2000 (Invitrogen) following the 
manufacturer’s instructions. 
 
Zika virus infection. Cells at 70% confluence were rinsed with PBS, and virus diluted in growth 
medium supplemented with L-glutamine and 1% FBS. Virus inoculum was removed after 1 hr 
and replaced with fresh media. Cells and supernatants were harvested at the indicated times post-
infection for determination of TCID50. 
 
Flag affinity purification. 5 x 150 cm2 dishes of subconfluent (80%) 293 T-REx cells 
expressing the protein of interest were scraped into PBS, pooled, washed twice in 10 ml PBS, 
and collected by centrifugation at 1000 x g for 5 min at 4°C. Cell pellets were stored at -80°C 
until lysis. The cell pellet was weighed, and 1:4 pellet weight/lysis buffer (by volume) was 
added. Lysis buffer consisted of 50 mM HEPES-NaOH (pH 8.0), 100 mM KCl, 2 mM EDTA, 
  
8 
0.1% Nonidet P-40, 10% glycerol, 1 mM PMSF, 1 mM DTT, and 1:500 protease inhibitor 
mixture (Sigma-Aldrich, St. Louis, MO). On resuspension, cells were incubated on ice for 10 
min, subjected to one additional freeze-thaw cycle, then centrifuged at 27,000 x g for 20 min at 4 
°C. The supernatant was transferred to a fresh 15 ml conical tube, and 1:1000 turbonuclease 
(BioVision) plus 30 ul packed, pre-equilibrated Flag-M2 agarose beads (Sigma-Aldrich) were 
added. The mixture was incubated for 2 h at 4°C with end-over-end rotation. Beads were pelleted 
by centrifugation at 1000 x g for 1 min and transferred with 1 ml of lysis buffer to a fresh 
centrifuge tube. Beads were washed once with 1 ml lysis buffer and twice with 1 ml ammonium 
bicarbonate (ammbic) rinsing buffer (50mM ammbic, pH 8.0, 75mM KCl). Elution was 
performed by incubating the beads with 150 ul of 125 mM ammonium hydroxide (pH ~11). The 
elution step was repeated twice, and the combined eluate centrifuged at 15,000 x g for 1 min, 
transferred to a fresh centrifuge tube and lyophilized. 
 
Biotin-streptavidin affinity purification. Cell pellets were resuspended in 10 mL of lysis buffer 
(50 mM Tris-HCl pH 7.5, 150 mM NaCl, 1 mM EDTA, 1 mM EGTA, 1% Triton X-100, 0.1% 
SDS, 1:500 protease inhibitor cocktail (Sigma-Aldrich), 1:1000 turbonuclease), incubated on an 
end-over-end rotator at 4°C for 1 hr, briefly sonicated to disrupt any visible aggregates, then 
centrifuged at 16,000 x g for 30 min at 4°C. The supernatant was transferred to a fresh 15 mL 
conical tube, 30ul of packed, pre-equilibrated streptavidin-sepharose beads (GE) were added, and 
the mixture incubated for 3 hr at 4°C with end-over-end rotation. Beads were pelleted by 
centrifugation at 2000 rpm for 2 min and transferred with 1 ml of lysis buffer to a fresh 
Eppendorf tube. Beads were washed once with 1 ml lysis buffer and twice with 1 ml of 50 mM 
ammbic (pH 8.3). Beads were transferred in ammbic to a fresh centrifuge tube, and washed two 
  
9 
more times with 1 ml ammbic buffer. Tryptic digestion was performed by incubating the beads 
with 1 ug MS grade TPCK trypsin (Promega, Madison, WI) dissolved in 200 ul of 50 mM 
ammbic (pH 8.3) overnight at 37°C. The following morning, an additional 0.5 ug trypsin was 
added, and the beads incubated for 2 hr at 37°C. Beads were pelleted by centrifugation at 2000 x 
g for 2 min, and the supernatant was transferred to a fresh Eppendorf tube. Beads were washed 
twice with 150 ul of 50 mM ammonium bicarbonate, and washes pooled with the eluate. The 
sample was lyophilized and resuspended in buffer A (0.1% formic acid). 1/5th of the sample was 
analyzed per MS run. 
 
Mass spectrometry analysis. High performance liquid chromatography was conducted using a 2 
cm pre-column (Acclaim PepMap 50 mm x 100 um inner diameter (ID)) and 50 cm analytical 
column (Acclaim PepMap, 500 mm x 75 um ID; C18; 2 um; 100 Å, Thermo Fisher Scientific, 
Waltham, MA), running a 120 min reversed-phase buffer gradient at 225 nl/min on a Proxeon 
EASY-nLC 1000 pump in-line with a Thermo Q-Exactive HF quadrupole-Orbitrap mass 
spectrometer. A parent ion scan was performed using a resolving power of 60,000, then up to the 
twenty most intense peaks were selected for MS/MS (minimum ion count of 1,000 for 
activation) using higher energy collision induced dissociation (HCD) fragmentation. Dynamic 
exclusion was activated such that MS/MS of the same m/z (within a range of 10 ppm; exclusion 
list size = 500) detected twice within 5 sec were excluded from analysis for 15 sec. For protein 
identification, Thermo .RAW files were converted to the .mzXML format using ProteoWizard 
(v3.0.10800; 4/27/2017) (25). Using the Trans-Proteomic Pipeline (TPP v4.7 Polar Vortex rev 1, 
linux build 201705011551) converted files were searched using X!Tandem (Jackhammer TPP 
2013.06.15.1) (26) and Comet (2014.02 rev. 2) (27) against the Human RefSeq Version 45 
  
10 
database (containing 36113 entries). Search parameters specified a parent ion mass tolerance of 
10 ppm, and an MS/MS fragment ion tolerance of 0.4 Da, with up to 2 missed cleavages allowed 
for trypsin. No fixed modifications were used. Variable modifications of +16@M and W, 
+32@M and W, +42@N-terminus, and +1@N and Q were allowed. Proteins identified with an 
iProphet cut-off of 0.9 (corresponding to ≤1% FDR) and at least two unique peptides were 
analyzed with SAINT Express v.3.6. Control runs (16 runs for BioID; 16 runs for IP-MS; all 
from cells expressing the FlagBirA* epitope tag only) were collapsed to the four highest spectral 
counts for each prey, and high confidence interactors were defined as those with BFDR≤0.01. 
Each bait protein was analyzed with both an N- and C-terminal BirA* tag. Two biological 
replicates (i.e. separate transfections) were each subjected to two MS runs (two technical 
replicates). Each of the ten ZIKV bait proteins was analyzed using both BioID and Flag IP, for a 
total of 160 MS runs. Average R2 between technical replicates: 0.976. Average R2 between 
biological replicates: 0.888 (Table S1). 
 
Networks and clustering analysis. SAINT data were imported into Cytoscape 3.4 
(http://www.cytoscape.org). All network files and parameters are available at http://prohits-
web.lunenfeld.ca/.  
 
Immunofluorescence, image acquisition and processing. Transiently transfected HeLa cells 
expressing GFP- or FlagBirA*-tagged proteins were grown on coverslips, fixed with 4% 
paraformaldehyde for 15 min, and washed in PBS with 0.1% Triton X-100. Cells were blocked 
in 5% bovine serum albumin (BSA) in PBS for 30 min before incubating in the indicated 
primary antibodies for 1 hr at RT. Primary antibodies were used at the following concentrations: 
  
11 
anti-FLAG M2 (1:500; Sigma-Aldrich), anti-CANX C5C9 (1:50; Cell Signaling Technologies), 
anti-Lamin B1 (1:1000; Abcam 16048), anti-COIL (1:1000; Abcam 11822), anti-P4HB (1:1000; 
Stressgen, SPA-891), anti-Fibrillarin (1:100; Abcam 5821). After removing the antibody 
solution, cells were washed once and incubated for 1 hr with anti-mouse or anti-rabbit Alexa 
(488, 594, or 647)-conjugated secondary antibodies. In some cases, Streptavidin-Alexa594 
(1:5000, Invitrogen) or BODIPY 493/503 (1:100, Invitrogen) were added with secondary 
antibodies. Cells were washed twice with PBS, then with 1 ug/mL of 4’,6-diamidino-2- 
phenylindole (DAPI) in PBS for 5 min. After washing with PBS three more times for 5 min 
each, coverslips were mounted with ProLong Gold Antifade (Thermo Fischer Scientific). Cells 
were imaged using PlanApo 60X oil lens, NA 1.40 on an Olympus FV1000 confocal microscope 
(zoom factor between 3-5; Olympus America, Melville, NY). Images were processed using the 
Volocity Viewer v.6 and assembled using Adobe Illustrator CS6 (Adobe Systems Inc.). 
 
Cajal body quantification. HeLa cells were transfected with the FlagBirA*-NS5 vector, 
incubated 24 hrs, then incubated an additional 24 hrs on coverslips with biotin (50 uM). Cells 
were fixed and permeabilized as above, then stained with anti-COIL and Streptavidin AF594 (as 
a reporter of positive FlagBirA*-NS5 cells). Cajal body (CB) volumes (red objects gated 
between 0.1-5 um3) were quantified using the Volocity 6.0 measurement tool. In each 
experiment, CB volumes (COIL-positive nuclear bodies) were quantified in DAPI positive 
objects (gated between 100-500 um3) of the NS5-positive gated population vs. the NS5 
low/negative gated population. Data (raw data Table S4) of 25 stitched fields for each of the two 
independent experiments were merged and plotted using Excel. For calculation of the number of 
CB/cell, three non-overlapping fields per experiment were used, and the number of CB observed 
  
12 
in each subpopulation was averaged according to the number of nuclei (Table S3). Student’s t-
test was performed with Excel T.TEST function (Microsoft). 
 
Lysosome quantification. HeLa cells were transfected with the indicated GFP-tagged constructs 
and incubated 48 hrs on coverslips at 37°C. Cultured cells were stained with 1 ug/mL of Hoechst 
33342 dye (Fisher Scientific) for 15 min at 37°C. Cells were washed twice with pre-warmed 
PBS, before incubating in DMEM with no pH indicator (GIBCO, Invitrogen). Lysotracker Red 
DND-99 (Molecular Probes) was used at 50 nM for 30 min. Coverslips were fixed with 4% 
paraformaldehyde for 15 min, then washed three times with PBS, and mounted. Lysosome 
volumes (red objects gated between 0.1-5 um3) were quantified using the Volocity 6.0 
measurement tool. Data from 16 stitched fields per condition were merged. ANOVA was 
performed with the FUNCRES.XLAM Excel add-in. Student’s t-test was performed with Excel 
T.TEST function (Microsoft). Graph and data distribution were assembled with Excel. 
 
Centriolar satellite microscopy. Cells were probed with a PCM1 rabbit polyclonal antibody 
(A301-149A, Bethyl) and imaged with a 60X oil-immersion objective (1.42 NA) on a 
Deltavision Elite DV imaging system equipped with sCMOS 2048 x 2048 pixels2 camera (GE 
Healthcare). Z stacks (0.2 um) were collected, deconvolved using softWoRx v5.0 (Applied 
Precision) and are shown as maximum intensity projections (pixel size 0.1064 um). 
 
Peroxisome microscopy. Cells were fixed in paraformaldehyde and permeabilized with 0.1% 
Triton X-100 in PBS, followed by incubation with the indicated antibodies. A Zeiss LSM 710 
laser-scanning confocal microscope with a 63x1.4 NA oil immersion objective was used to 
  
13 
acquire fluorescence images of cells. Z-stacks series were collected for measuring cell and 
peroxisome volume. Volocity 5.0 software (Perkin Elmer) was used to quantify cell volume, 
peroxisome number (peroxisome density) and peroxisome volume. ImageJ (NIH, Bethesda) was 
used to adjust brightness and contrast of images. 
 
Immunoblotting and co-IP. Vero cell lysates in Laemmli buffer were analyzed by SDS-PAGE 
and subjected to western blot using: rabbit monoclonal anti-PMP70 (Abcam), rabbit polyclonal 
anti-PEX14 (Millipore), mouse monoclonal anti-ATP5A (Abcam), mouse monoclonal anti-
GAPDH-HRP (Novusbio), goat anti-rabbit IgG-HRP (Santa Cruz), goat anti-mouse IgG-HRP 
(Cedarlane). FlagBirA*-tagged protein extression was assayed by SDS-PAGE and western blot 
using: anti-FLAG M2, and biotinylated substrates visualized with Streptactin-HRP (BioRad, 
1:10000 in PBS 0.1% Tween, 5% BSA). Co-IP was performed on 293 T-REx cells expressing 
FlagBirA*-NS3, as described in (4) and proteins analyzed by SDS-PAGE and western blot using 
anti-CEP85 antibody (Abnova H00064793-B01P, 1:500).

Results 
The ZIKV genome encodes a single large polyprotein, which is cleaved by viral and host cell 
proteases to generate ten distinct polypeptides (Fig. 1A). To better understand ZIKV-host 
interactions, the ten ZIKV proteins were fused in-frame with an N- or C-terminal Flag-BirA 
R118G tag (constructs based on ZIKV H/PF/2013 ANO46305.1 (28); individual proteins based 
on cleavage sites reported in (18)) and expressed in HEK 293 cells, a system that displays 
characteristics of immature neurons (29) and which can be infected with ZIKV (30) (fig. S1A, 
B). Bait protein localization was queried using anti-Flag immunofluorescence (IF) confocal 
microscopy (fig. S1C; additional IF available at ProHits-web.ca). Localizations were consistent 
with a number of previous reports on ZIKV and/or related Flaviviral proteins (fig S1C). Co-
localization of otherwise identical N- and C-terminal-tagged ZIKV proteins indicated that the 
tagging moieties did not significantly affect intracellular localization (fig. S1D). 
 
Using these cells, the virus-host protein interaction landscape was characterized using 
immunoprecipitation coupled with mass spectrometry (Flag IP-MS) and proximity-dependent 
biotin identification (BioID (31), table S1, fig S2A-B; searchable dataset available at ProHits-
web.ca; raw data available at massive.ucsd.edu, accession #MSV000082311). Using a Bayesian 
false discovery rate of ≤1%, 3033 high confidence interactions were identified amongst 1224 
unique human proteins.  
 
To better understand the ZIKV-host interactome, a self-organized force-directed bait-prey 
topology map was generated, in which map location is determined by the number and abundance 
(i.e. total peptide counts) of host interactors (Fig. 1B). As expected, this approach closely 
  
15 
clustered all six predicted ZIKV transmembrane proteins. This “core” map region encompasses 
the most highly interconnected preys (i.e. those that interact with the highest number of baits; 
Fig. 1C) and is enriched for nuclear, endoplasmic reticulum (ER), Golgi and other membrane 
polypeptides. Capsid protein (C) interactors were enriched in both membrane and non-membrane 
proteins; this bait polypeptide thus occupies a distinct territory connected to, yet slightly 
removed from, the core. The three non-membrane ZIKV proteins (NS1, NS3 and NS5) occupy 
peripheral areas of the map (Fig. 1B). These areas are enriched for e.g. DNA and RNA-
associated proteins (Fig. 1C). Previously described virus protein interactors and putative novel 
interactors are represented throughout the map (Fig. 1C).  
 
347 physical or functional interactors previously implicated in Flavivirus infection, and an 
additional 434 interactors linked to other viruses, are represented in the ZIKV interactome (Fig. 
1D; table S1), comprising >60% of the interaction network and highlighting the quality of the 
dataset. 738 polypeptides were detected as high confidence interactors for a single ZIKV bait 
protein, revealing a high degree of specificity for the viral-host interactions. Relevant to the link 
between ZIKV infection and fetal brain development, more than 85% of the ZIKV interacting 
proteins identified in HEK 293 cells are expressed in the human cerebral cortex (32) (fig S2C, 
table S2).  
 
165 proteins were detected by both BioID and IP-MS (Fig. 1E). This protein population was 
significantly enriched for host components localized to soluble cellular fractions (e.g. RNA 
binding proteins (73/165; GO:0003723) and nucleolar (54/165; GO:0005730) components) but 
  
16 
was depleted for membrane proteins (Table S2). Only ten interactors in this group were 
annotated as intrinsic to intracellular membranes (GO:0031300).  
 
While the two techniques identified a roughly equal number of high confidence interactors (701 
vs. 688 proteins identified by IP-MS and BioID, respectively), BioID identified >3x more 
membrane-associated polypeptides (Fig. 1E; see table S3 for all GO annotations). Consistent 
with this observation, while both datasets are enriched for e.g. ubiquitin proteasome system 
(UPS) components, the IP-MS dataset is uniquely enriched in cytoplasmic polypeptides and 
RNA processing proteins, while the BioID dataset is specifically enriched for nuclear, ER and 
Golgi membrane proteins, cytoplasmic vesicle and lipid droplet components (Fig. 1F). Similar to 
previous reports (33, 34), our data thus suggest that IP-MS and BioID sample largely discrete 
protein populations and intracellular environments, and thereby identify complementary 
interactor sets.  
 
Consistent with previous CRISPR- and sh/siRNA-based screens identifying host proteins 
required for Flavivirus replication (21-23, 35, 36), multiple ZIKV polypeptides interact with 
components of the ER signal peptidase complex, ER membrane complex, glucosyltransferases 
and the BAT3 tail-anchored membrane protein insertion complex (Fig. 2A). This large suite of 
host proteins is thus likely to be required for proper ZIKV polypeptide folding, processing, post-
translational modification, membrane localization and virion assembly.  
 
Individual ZIKV protein interactomes revealed targeting to host proteins with a variety of 
biological functions. For example, the Capsid (C) protein IP-MS identified interactions with 
  
17 
multiple nucleolar proteins (Fig. 2B). Consistent with this observation and previous reports 
demonstrating that the related Dengue virus (DENV) capsid protein is localized to the nucleolus 
(37), IF confocal microscopy of ZIKV C-expressing cells revealed co-localization with the 
nucleolar marker fibrillarin (Fig. 2C). BioID identified C proximity interactions at the nuclear, 
ER and other membranes (Fig. 2B). C is also localized to DAPI-poor nuclear structures not 
associated with fibrillarin, and which are not observed in cells expressing other ZIKV proteins 
(Fig. 2D, fig. S1C). These structures were also detected by antibodies directed against lamin B1, 
suggesting that they are derived (at least in part) from the nuclear membrane. Surprisingly, these 
structures were also detected by antibodies directed against the ER markers prolyl 4-hydroxylase 
subunit B (P4HB) and calnexin (CANX; Fig. 2E). Consistent with this observation, when Flag-
FAM134B (a C-interacting protein required for ER-specific autophagy (38) and which inhibits 
ZIKV replication (39)) was co-expressed with GFP-Capsid protein, it was also recruited to these 
nuclear structures (Fig. 2E). Like other Flaviviruses, ZIKV extensively remodels the host 
endomembrane system to create viral replication factories (40). While additional study will be 
required to better understand these C-associated structures, our observations are consistent with 
previous reports (e.g. (41)) suggesting that ZIKV promotes the inward budding of host 
membranes. 
 
In the cytoplasm, C is localized to the ER and vesicular structures (Fig. 2F). The C interactome 
includes a number of proteins associated with lipid storage and metabolism (Fig. 2B) and, 
consistent with previous work demonstrating that both DENV and Hepatitis C virus capsid 
proteins localize to the surface of lipid droplets (42), cytoplasmic ZIKV C co-localizes with the 
lipid droplet marker Bodipy 493/503 (Fig. 2F). Together, these findings reveal multiple putative 
  
18 
roles for C in remodeling host cell membranes, and highlight the advantages of using both IP-MS 
and BioID for a more complete characterization of protein-protein interactions. 
 
The other ZIKV proteins are targeted to a number of additional host cell systems and organelles. 
For example, consistent with a recent report (43), our Flag IP-MS links ZIKV NS5 to the STAT2 
signaling protein (table S1) as well as DDA1, DDB1 and VPRBP/DCAF1 (Fig. 3A), 
components of a host cell ubiquitin E3 ligase previously linked to several other viruses (44). IP-
MS conducted on both DDB1 and VPRBP/DCAF1 in the presence of NS5 validated these 
interactions for the ZIKV NS5 protein (Fig. 3A, table S4).  
 
NS5 BioID also identified components of the Cajal Body (CB; Fig. 3B), a nuclear organelle with 
crucial roles in spliceosomal snRNP maturation (45). The influenza A virus nucleoprotein is also 
localized to CBs (46) but little is known regarding the role of this organelle in the Flavivirus life 
cycle. Consistent with our data, both NS5 (but no other ZIKV proteins; Fig. 3C, fig. S3) and 
biotinylated proteins in NS5-expressing cells (Fig. 3D) co-localize with the CB marker coilin. 
BioID conducted on coilin in the presence and absence of NS5 (Fig. 3B, table S5) validated this 
interaction. Notably, NS5 expression was also uniquely associated with significantly increased 
numbers of CB/cell, accompanied by a significant decrease in CB volume (Fig. 3E, table S6). 
NS5 thus appears to disrupt CBs.  
 
NS3 BioID identified e.g. the Vaccinia restriction factor WDR6 (47) and the HIV1 dependency 
factor HELZ (48) as interacting partners. NS3 IP-MS identified the DENV host factor 
FASTKD5 (49) and UPS components previously linked to West Nile virus replication (50). NS3 
  
19 
IP-MS also identified VPS33A, VPS18 and VPS16, core components of the HOPS/CORVET 
vesicle tethering complexes (Fig. 3F) required for endosome-lysosome fusion (51). While no 
previous link with Flaviviruses has been reported, a genome-wide screen identified the HOPS 
complex as an Ebola restriction factor (52). Notably, consistent with the NS3-HOPS/CORVET 
interaction, cells expressing both NS3 and its co-factor NS2B (53) exhibited significantly smaller 
lysosomes (Fig. 3G, table S7), suggesting that the NS3-NS2B protease complex could disrupt 
lysosome function.  
 
ZIKV infection has been linked to significant defects in centrosome function (54, 55). Consistent 
with these observations, our data reveal ZIKV polypeptide interactions with multiple centrosome 
and cilia regulatory proteins. For example, NS3 (Fig. 3H) interacts with UNC119B, a myristoyl 
chaperone required for recruiting NPHP (nephronophthisis) proteins to cilia (56); CEP192, a 
major regulator of centrosome and spindle assembly; OFD1, a centrosome/centriolar satellite 
protein (57); and CEP85, a protein linked to centrosome biogenesis (58, 59). The NS3-OFD1 
interaction was validated via BioID (Fig. 3H, table S8) and the NS3-CEP85 interaction was 
confirmed by co-IP western (Fig. 3I). Consistent with these data, NS3 and its biotinylated 
proximity partners co-localize with pericentrin (PCNT), a component of the pericentriolar 
material (Fig. 3I). NS3 also localized to the abscission sites of dividing cells, suggesting an 
interaction with shared components of the centrosome and midbody (Fig 3J). While no gross 
defects were observed for primary cilia or centrosomes in ZIKV-infected Vero cells (data not 
shown), structured illumination microscopy revealed large-scale disruption of centriolar satellite 
clusters (Fig. 3K), consistent with disruption of centrosome function by ZIKV.  
 
  
20 
The peroxisome has important antiviral functions, and proteins from multiple viral classes 
localize to this organelle (60). Lipids synthesized exclusively in peroxisomes also appear to be 
required for viral replication: e.g. decreased peroxisome-specific ether lipid synthesis impairs 
influenza virus replication (61). Consistent with these studies, our data revealed extensive ZIKV 
protein interactions with peroxisome-associated polypeptides (Fig. 4A). For example, several 
ZIKV proteins established high confidence interactions with the peroxisomal membrane protein 
ABCD3/PMP70; ACBD5, VAPA and VAPB, a set of ER-peroxisome membrane contact site 
proteins required for lipid transfer (62, 63); and the peroxisome biogenesis protein PEX11B. 
ZIKV NS2A uniquely interacts with both components of the peroxisome protein import 
complex, PEX3 and PEX19 (Fig. 4A). Consistent with these data, GFP-NS2A (but no other 
ZIKV proteins) localizes to peroxisomes (Fig. 4B, fig. S4). To begin to explore the role of the 
peroxisome in ZIKV biology, GFP-NS2A was expressed in a wild type (wt) human skin 
fibroblast cell line and fibroblast lines derived from Zellweger syndrome patients deficient for 
PEX19 (PBD399 (64)) or PEX3 (PBD400 (65)) and thus lacking functional peroxisomes. As 
expected, GFP-NS2A co-localized with peroxisomes in wt fibroblasts (Fig. 4C). Notably, 
however, it was mislocalized to the cytoplasm in both PBD399 and PBD400 cells, suggesting 
that NS2A is specifically targeted to peroxisomes (Fig. 4C).  
 
ABCD3/PMP70 is significantly decreased in response to ZIKV infection (as compared to control 
proteins GAPDH and ATP5A; Fig. 4D). Consistent with this observation, significant decreases 
in peroxisome density (peroxisomes/unit cell volume) were also observed in cells expressing 
GFP-NS2A (Fig. 4F, table S9) and in ZIKV-infected cells (Fig. 4E, 4G, table S10). Finally, 
  
21 
consistent with an important role for the peroxisome in ZIKV biology, ZIKV yields were 
significantly lower in Zellweger fibroblasts than in WT cells (Fig. 4H).  
 
Discussion 
Together, our global ZIKV interactome identifies >1200 putative host interacting protein 
partners, physically linking the ten individual viral proteins to specific human polypeptides, and 
revealing a broad array of putative accessory functions for both the structural and non-structural 
Zika polypeptides in the virus life cycle (Fig. 5; for detailed enrichment analysis, see table S2). 
For example, the NS3 protease has been linked to ZIKV polyprotein cleavage and is essential for 
virus replication (66). Our data suggest that co-expression of NS3 and its co-factor NS2B can 
also impact lysosome function. Interactions between NS3 and three components of the 
HOPS/CORVET complex suggest that the decreased lysosome volume observed specifically in 
response to the co-expression of NS2B and NS3 could be due to a defect in late endosome-
lysosome fusion, potentially supporting virus-containing endosome escape from lysosomal 
degradation and clearance. Our analysis also revealed a clear association of NS4A, NS4B and 
PreM with the 26S proteasome. While these interactions remain to be investigated in an 
infectious context, the data suggest a putative role for this set of ZIKV proteins in e.g. blocking 
viral protein degradation, or the targeted degradation of host innate immune response proteins. 
As expected, C, PreM and Env were localized to the ER, where virus factories are created and 
viral particles assembled (67). We also detected NS2A, NS2B, NS4A and NS4B at this 
organelle. These four non-structural proteins are also likely to be involved in the formation of 
virus-induced membrane structures at the ER, by homology with West Nile Virus proteins (68).  
  
22 
NS2A and NS2B are also likely to play roles in vRNA replication, as reported for the 
homologous proteins in the Japanese encephalitis virus (69) .  
 
The BioID approach revealed a number of associations between specific Zika polypeptides and 
host-cell lipid metabolism machinery, which is significantly reprogrammed upon Flaviviral 
infection (reviewed in (70)). Like the DENV capsid polypeptide (42), the ZIKV Capsid protein 
was also detected at lipid droplets, where it could highjack host-cell lipid metabolism for viral 
replication. We also found that ZIKV NS2A is uniquely targeted to peroxisomes, an organelle 
that plays a critical role in lipid processing, and which acts as an important innate immune 
response signalling platform (60, 61). ZIKV infection or expression of NS2A alone decreased 
peroxisome density (organelle number/cell volume) in host cells, and ZIKV replication was 
significantly impaired in peroxisome-deficient cells. Together, these data suggest that NS2A 
targets peroxisomes to remodel host-cell lipid populations and/or to effect viral escape from the 
host innate immune response (as previously shown for DENV and WNV (71)).  
 
We also detected a large number of interactors involved in DNA and RNA metabolism. For 
example, ZIKV NS5 interacts with coilin, a major component of the Cajal Body (CB), a nuclear 
membrane-free organelle required for spliceosome maturation. We speculate that the ability of 
NS5 to fragment CBs could impair the processing of host-cell mRNAs, and thereby increase the 
availability of host ribosomes for viral RNA translation, and/or ZIKV NS5 could be important 
for usurping CB activities required for vRNA maturation.  
 
  
23 
Notably, expression of the C protein alone induced the inward budding of nuclear/ER 
membranes into the nucleoplasm. The ability of C to interact with both host endomembranes and 
RNAs has been well documented, properties that are critical for vRNA encapsidation in 
Flavivirus virions (reviewed in (72)). Its positively charged carboxy-terminal domain makes it 
very efficient at interacting with RNAs, and we hypothesize that it could sequester host mRNAs 
in the nucleus to promote vRNA translation. Consistent with a previous report (73), a 
subpopulation of the ZIKV capsid protein is localized to the nucleolus. Capsid nucleolar 
localization has been documented for other Flaviviruses (74), but the function of the viral protein 
in this host organelle remains unclear. Addressing the capsid protein to nucleoli could be 
important for maintaining host ribosomal RNA production during infection, and thus preserving 
functional host cell translation machinery. Finally, we report that ZIKV infection is accompanied 
by centriolar satellite dissolution. Deficiencies in a number of different centrosomal proteins, 
including satellite components (75), have been linked to congenital microcephalies (76). 
Together with the specific interactions we report between ZIKV NS3 and multiple centrosome 
components (e.g. CEP192, CEP85, OFD1), this observation could help to explain the surge in 
microcephaly cases observed in infected human populations. The relationship between NS3 and 
centriolar satellites will be important to investigate.  
 
It is important to note that the current dataset: (i) does not include interactions between viral 
proteins; (ii) describes interactions that occur under relatively high ZIKV protein expression 
levels, and; (iii) likely lacks some virus-host protein interactions that can only be observed in the 
context of a viral infection. Nevertheless, our data highlight the astounding versatility of ZIKV 
polypeptides to simultaneously target numerous host cell organelles, and provide important 
  
24 
molecular insights into how ZIKV proteins could usurp and manipulate the host-cell machinery 
to the benefit of the virus. As we demonstrate here, this dataset represents a rich resource that 
can be mined to better understand how ZIKV exploits and/or disrupts specific host cell systems 
and organelles, and thus paves the way for a better understanding of ZIKV biology and the 
identification of new antiviral targets.

NS2B protease interacts with HOPS/CORVET complex components, accompanied by an 
apparent inhibition of late endosome-lysosome fusion. NS3-NS2B function could thus be 
important to protect endosomal ZIKV from lysosome-mediated degradation; (2) PreM, NS4A 
and NS4B are associated with the 26S proteasome. This host cell complex is commonly 
  
29 
highjacked by viruses for e.g. innate immune system evasion; (3) multiple ZIKV proteins 
localize to the ER, consistent with roles in viral factory formation and viral replication; (4) like 
other Flaviviruses, the ZIKV capsid protein is addressed to lipid droplets, where it could e.g. 
highjack host-cell lipid metabolism for viral replication; (5) NS2A is uniquely localized to 
peroxisomes, and negatively impacts peroxisome density; (6) NS5 is localized to and appears to 
disrupt Cajal bodies, possibly to impair host cell splicing or usurp CB activities for viral RNA 
maturation; (7) ZIKV capsid protein-induced inward nuclear/ER membrane budding is likely 
important for the creation of viral factories; (8) Deficiencies in centrosomal proteins, including 
centriolar satellite components, are responsible for congenital microcephalies. ZIKV infection 
results in the dispersion of centriolar satellites, possibly explaining the surge in microcephaly 
cases associated with infected human populations.
