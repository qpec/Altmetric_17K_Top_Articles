Months Old After Introduction of 
Conjugated Pneumococcal Vaccines

abstract
BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVES: In June 2010, Kaiser Permanente Northern California replaced all 
7-valent pneumococcal conjugate vaccine (PCV7) vaccines with the 13-valent pneumococcal 
conjugate vaccine (PCV13). Our objectives were to compare the incidence of bacteremia 
in children 3 to 36 months old by 3 time periods: pre-PCV7, post-PCV7/pre-PCV13, and 
post-PCV13.
METHODS: We designed a retrospective review of the electronic medical records of all blood 
cultures collected on children 3 to 36 months old at Kaiser Permanente Northern California 
from September 1, 1998 to August 31, 2014 in outpatient clinics, in emergency departments, 
and in the first 24 hours of hospitalization.
RESULTS: During the study period, 57 733 blood cultures were collected in the population 
of children 3 to 36 months old. Implementation of routine immunization with the 
pneumococcal conjugate vaccine resulted in a 95.3% reduction of Streptococcus pneumoniae 
bacteremia, decreasing from 74.5 to 10 to 3.5 per 100 000 children per year by the post-
PCV13 period. As pneumococcal rates decreased, Escherichia coli, Salmonella spp, and 
Staphylococcus aureus caused 77% of bacteremia. Seventy-six percent of all bacteremia in 
the post-PCV13 period occurred with a source.
CONCLUSIONS: In the United States, routine immunizations have made bacteremia in the 
previously healthy toddler a rare event. As the incidence of pneumococcal bacteremia has 
decreased, E coli, Salmonella spp, and S aureus have increased in relative importance. New 
guidelines are needed to approach the previously healthy febrile toddler in the outpatient 
setting.

WHAT’S KNOWN ON THIS SUBJECT: After routine 
immunization with pneumococcal conjugate vaccine, 
pneumococcal bacteremia rates have decreased. 
Escherichia coli, Salmonella spp, and Staphylococcus 
aureus have become the leading causes of 
bacteremia in children 3 to 36 months old.
WHAT THIS STUDY ADDS: Implementation of 
routine immunization with 13-valent pneumococcal 
conjugate vaccine resulted in a 95.3% reduction in 
pneumococcal bacteremia. After implementation, 
Escherichia coli, Salmonella spp, and Staphylococcus 
aureus caused 77% of bacteremia, and 76% of 
bacteremia occurred with a source.

Before the introduction of the 
7-valent pneumococcal conjugate 
vaccine (PCV7) (Prevnar 7; Wyeth, 
now Pfizer, New York, NY) in April 
2000, the risk of bacteremia for 
febrile children 3 to 36 months old 
in an ambulatory setting was 1.6% 
to 4.3%. 
1 
 
 
– 
6 After its introduction, 
bacteremia became a rare event, 
occurring in 0.16% to 0.37% of 
febrile children. 
7, 
 
8 Furthermore, the 
rate of Streptococcus pneumoniae 
bacteremia decreased, 
 
1, 
9 
 
 
 
 
– 
16 with a 
range of 0.09% to 0.27%. 
9
In a post-PCV7 patient population, 
the distribution of pathogens found 
in blood cultures markedly changed. 
Bacteremia was increasingly caused 
by Escherichia coli, nonvaccine 
serotypes of S pneumoniae, Salmonella 
spp, Staphylococcus aureus, and 
Streptococcus pyogenes. 
1, 
 
17
As pneumococcal rates decreased, 
regional variability and trends in 
rates of Salmonella spp, S aureus, and 
Neisseria meningitidis bacteremia 
have become increasingly important. 
Rates of gastrointestinal illness from 
Salmonella spp from 1998 to 2014 
have been nearly constant, averaging 
15 cases per 100 000 people. 
18 With 
significant worldwide variability, 
recent estimates of S aureus 
bacteremia range from 6 to 20 per 
100 000 children. 
19, 
 
20 A growing rate 
of S aureus bacteremia attributable to 
a rise in methicillin-resistant S aureus 
(MRSA) 
21, 
22 has been occurring for 
decades, 
 
19, 
 
22 
 
–25 but this increase may 
have stabilized in the last several 
years. 
19 N meningitidis bacteremia 
rates have been steadily declining 
in the United States since the late 
1990s to a current estimate of 0.3 per 
100 000 children. 
26
In June 2010, Kaiser Permanente 
Northern California (KPNC) 
introduced universal immunization 
with the 13-valent pneumococcal 
conjugate vaccine (PCV13). Several 
studies predicted the continued 
decline in invasive pneumococcal 
disease post-PCV13. 
27, 
 
28 Initial 
trends through 2012 demonstrated 
continued decline in pneumococcal 
infections, with the biggest impact 
in children <5 years old. 
17,

– 
32 Our 
objectives were to compare the 
incidence rate of, proportion of 
pathogens of, and risk factors for 
bacteremia in children 3 to 36 months 
old by 3 time periods: pre-PCV7, post-
PCV7/pre-PCV13, and post-PCV13.
METHODS
Study Design
This retrospective cohort study 
analyzed the electronic medical records 
(EMRs) of all blood cultures collected 
from September 1, 1998 to August 31, 
2014 on previously healthy children 
age 3 to 36 months in the clinic, in the 
emergency department (ED), or in 
the first 24 hours of hospitalization 
at KPNC. Previously healthy was 
defined as children without underlying 
immunocompromising conditions, 
oncologic diagnoses, or genetic 
disorders (as defined by International 
Classification of Diseases, Ninth 
Revision codes) diagnosed before 
blood culture acquisition but during 
the child’s lifetime, obtained from 
encounter diagnosis or problem list; 
or current central venous catheters 
before blood culture acquisition, 
obtained from encounter diagnosis 
or problem list. 
33, 
 
34 Data extraction 
from EMRs identified subject medical 
record number, sex, date of birth, 
date of visit, site of blood acquisition, 
organisms identified in blood culture, 
and receipt of pneumococcal conjugate 
vaccine (PCV7 or PCV13). If the blood 
culture was positive with a pathogen, 
urine and stool culture results within 
3 days of blood culture acquisition 
were reviewed. Urinalysis results were 
considered positive if the specimen 
contained leukocyte esterase or had >5 
white blood cells per high-powered 
field.
In June 2010, KPNC introduced 
universal immunization with PCV13. 
Previously, from April 2000 to May 
2010, children received PCV7. All 
pneumococcal vaccines given after 
July 1, 2010 were PCV13. Routine 
immunization was administered at 
2, 4, and 6 months, with a booster 
between 12 and 15 months. The 
number and type of pneumococcal 
conjugate vaccine were recorded.
To analyze clinically significant 
bacteremia, we classified all organisms 
identified in blood cultures as either 
a likely contaminating organism 
or a potential pathogen. 
1 Although 
some organisms could be considered 
clinically significant pathogens in 
unusual circumstances, based on usual 
clinical presentation, pathogenicity in 
a previously healthy host, and review 
of the EMR by author T.L.G., some 
organisms were identified as likely 
blood culture contaminants. Bacterial 
isolates such as Staphylococcus 
epidermidis, Micrococcus, and 
diphtheroids were considered 
contaminants unless they were 
isolated from ≥2 bacterial cultures. 
The charts of children with viridans 
group Streptococcus-positive blood 
cultures were reviewed to determine 
whether the isolate was a contaminant. 
Blood culture contaminants were not 
included in our analysis of bacteremia 
and were reported separately.
Study Setting
From 1998 to 2014, KPNC had >3 
million members each year and >40 
pediatric clinics, 19 EDs, and 10 
pediatric hospital wards. At several 
facilities, a pediatric consult was 
available for in-person evaluation in 
the ED.
Statistical Methods
We compared the incidence rate of 
all bacteremia in children 3 to 36 
months old during 3 time periods: 
pre-PCV7 (September 1998–March 
2000), post-PCV7/pre-PCV13 (April 
2000–May 2010), and post-PCV13 
(June 2010–August 2014).
The numbers of blood cultures 
and cases of bacteremia per KPNC 
member ages 3 to 36 months per 
year were calculated. The cases 
of bacteremia per blood culture

obtained per year were calculated. A 
comparison of the relative incidence 
rate of bacteremia by organism was 
performed. Poisson regression was 
used to model quarterly rates of 
all bacteremia and S pneumoniae 
bacteremia. An interrupted time 
series analysis was conducted.
Comparisons involving categorical 
variables were performed via the 
χ2 or Fisher’s exact test. Normally 
distributed continuous variables 
were compared via Student’s t test or 
analysis of variance. Comparisons of 
non–normally distributed continuous 
variables were conducted via the 
Wilcoxon rank-sum test or Kruskal–
Wallis test. Time series analysis was 
performed in SAS version 9.3 (SAS 
Institute, Inc, Cary, NC).
RESULTS
During this 16-year study (1998–
2014), the annual total population 
of children age 3 to 36 months at 
KPNC ranged from 94 269 to 103 474 
(average, 98 447; SD 2640). A total of 
74 665 blood cultures were obtained 
from all children age 3 to 36 months; 
61 563 of these cultures were taken 
in healthy toddlers. After removal of 
1251 cultures obtained >1 day into 
hospitalization and 2579 duplicate 
cultures (ie, >1 blood culture obtained 
during single episode of illness), 
57 733 blood cultures were obtained. 
Cultures were acquired from outpatient 
clinics (33 391 [58%]), from EDs 
(20 978 [36%]), and in the first 24 
hours of hospitalization (3364 [6%]) 
( 
Table 1). Of these cultures, 538 (1%) 
grew a pathogen, 1173 (2%) grew a 
contaminant, and 56 022 (97%) were 
negative. Between 1998 to 1999 and 
2013 to 2014, the total number of 
annual blood cultures dropped by 68% 
overall and 45% in the ED (Cochran–
Armitage trend test P < .001).
From 1998 to 2014, more blood 
cultures were obtained in children 
12 to 23 months old, the post-PCV7/
pre-PCV13 study period, and the 
outpatient clinic. In contrast, more 
bacteremia occurred in children 
3 to 11 months old because of the 
preponderance of E coli in this age 
group. In all types of bacteremia 
except S aureus, the blood culture 
was more likely to be obtained in the 
outpatient setting. More cases of E coli 
bacteremia occurred in girls ( 
Table 1).
Etiology of Bacteremia
Bacteremia varied by age. Before 
the routine use of pneumococcal 
vaccine, E coli was the most common 
cause of bacteremia in children 3 to 
5 months of age, whereas at older 
ages the incidence of pneumococcal 
bacteremia dwarfed all others. In the 
years after routine use of PCV13, E 
coli was the most common organism 
causing bacteremia in children 3 to 11 
months old, occurring almost 4 times 
more frequently than S pneumoniae.
During the post-PCV13 study period, 
21 total pathogens (95% confidence 
interval [CI], 13.5–30.3) per 100 000 
children per year were identified 
in blood cultures ( 
Table 2). E coli, 
Salmonella spp, and S aureus accounted 
for 77% of overall pathogens ( 
Figs 
1 and  
2). Of the children with E coli 
bacteremia, 93% had a urinary tract 
source. A total of 76% of bacteremia 
occurred with a source, including 
34% urinary tract infections, 17% 
gastroenteritis, 8% pneumonias, 
8% osteomyelitis, 6% skin and soft 
tissue infections, and 3% other. The 
post-PCV13 annual incidence rate 
of bacteremia with a source was 
15.9 (95% CI, 9.4–23.5) per 100 000 
children. A total of 24% of bacteremia 
occurred without a source, including 
Salmonella typhi, S pneumoniae, E coli, 
Streptococcus agalactiae, N meningitidis, 
and nontypable Haemophilus 
influenzae. The post-PCV13 annual 
incidence rate of bacteremia without 
a source was 5 (95% CI, 1.6–11.3) per 
100 000 children.
Time Series Analysis
The rate of all bacteremia per 
100 000 children per year decreased

pre-PCV7 study period to 21 (95% CI, 
13.5–30.3) in the post-PCV13 study 
period. The rate of pneumococcal 
bacteremia per 100 000 children per 
year dropped from 74.5 (95% CI, 
59–93) in the pre-PCV7 study period 
to 3.5 (95% CI, 1.1–8.7) in the post-

Table 2). This 
was a decrease of 86.6% and 95.3% 
in study periods 2 and 3, respectively. 
Poisson regression modeling the 
observed rate of bacteremia revealed 
a trend over time to decreasing rates 
of all bacteremia (P < .001) and S 
pneumoniae bacteremia (P < .001) 
(

regression model, both PCV7 and 
PCV13 led to a significant reduction 
in all and S pneumoniae bacteremia 
rates. S pneumoniae bacteremia was 
highly seasonal, with the majority 
occurring in the winter (P = .01). Site 
of blood culture acquisition was not a 
predictor of all bacteremia.

meningitidis bacteremia decreased. 
The incidence rate of E coli, Salmonella 
spp, and S aureus bacteremia stayed 
constant over the 16 years ( 
Table 2, 
 
Fig 2). In the pre-PCV7 period, 78% 
of all significant cases of bacteremia 
were caused by S pneumoniae; this 
proportion dropped to 35% in the 
post-PCV7/pre-PCV13 period and to 
17% in the post-PCV13 period.
The rate of all bacteremia per 10 000 
blood cultures decreased from 168 
(95% CI, 144–195) in the pre-PCV7 
period to 75 (95% CI, 59–94) in the 
post-PCV7/pre-PCV13 period, then 
increased to 96 (95% CI, 78–117) 
in the post-PCV13 period. Rates of 
S pneumoniae and N meningitidis 
declined per 10 000 blood cultures, 
whereas rates of E coli, Salmonella 
spp, and S aureus bacteremia 
increased ( 
Table 2).
Contaminants
Contaminant organisms were grown 
from 1.9% of blood cultures and 
remained constant during the 3 study 
periods (range, 1.7%–2.4%). As the 
number of blood cultures obtained 
decreased, the rate of contaminated 
blood cultures per 100 000 children 
per year decreased from 100 (95% CI, 
82.1–120) pre-PCV7 to 45 (95% CI, 
33–59.8) ( 
Table 2). The contamination 
rate for the youngest children (3 to 11 
months old) was higher than at 12 to 
23 months or 24 to 36 months (P < .001). 
Compared with outpatient blood 
cultures, cultures from the ED and the 
first 24 hours of hospitalization were 
more likely to be a contaminant 
(P < .001). Of the 1173 total 
contaminants isolated over the 16 
study years, 319 children had 325 
additional blood cultures in the 1 to 
3 days after the contaminant was 
identified.
DISCUSSION
After the introduction of universal 
PCV13 immunization, bacteremia has 
become a rare event in previously 
healthy children 3 to 36 months old. 
Between 1998 to 1999 and 2013 to 
2014, the annual number of cases of 
all bacteremias dropped by 78%, and 
the annual number of pneumococcal 
cases dropped by 95.3%. As shown 
by time series analysis, the dramatic 
decline in S pneumoniae bacteremia 
rates was clearly related to the 
impact of immunization, as the 
incidence decreased from 74.5 (95% 
CI, 59–93) pre-PCV7 to 3.5 (95% CI, 
1.1–8.7) post-PCV13 per 100 000 
children per year.
Our post-PCV13 rates of S pneumoniae 
bacteremia in northern California 
were lower than those reported in 
New York City from 2007 to 2009 
and from 2011 to 2012 in children 
<5 years old. In the post-PCV7/
pre-PCV13 and post-PCV13 periods, 
Farnham et al 
29 reported a rate of 21 
and 6.4 cases per 100 000 children <5 
years old, respectively. In contrast, 
our rates in northern California were 
10 and 3.5 per 100 000 children 
3 to 36 months old, respectively. 
The lower rates at KPNC probably 
reflected a combination of regional 
variability, a continued decline in S 
pneumoniae bacteremia rates after the 
introduction of PCV13, including only 
a previously healthy population, and 
collecting fewer blood cultures and 
not capturing transient bacteremia.
In the post-PCV13 period, bacteremia 
was increasingly caused by E coli 
(39%), Salmonella spp (21%), and 
S aureus (17%). This changing 
distribution of pathogens has also been 
observed in the United Kingdom 
17 
and Israel. 
35 It is unclear how the 
northern California incident rates of 
E coli, Salmonella spp, and S aureus 
are generalizable to other regions of 
the United States. Overall Salmonella 
spp infections are highest in the 
southeastern United States, in boys, 
and in children <1 year old. Rates of 
Salmonella spp infections in California 
are similar to those of other western 
states with the exception of S typhi 
rates, which are much higher in 
northern California. Many counties in 
northern California report rates of >0.47 
cases per 100 000 population. 
18 Our 
incidence rate of 0.95 per 100 000 
children per year for S typhi and S 
paratyphi bacteremia is higher than the 
national and regional rates, probably

young age of our study population. 
The incidence of S aureus bacteremia 
in healthy children 3 to 36 months 
old has not been fully described; 
however, recent estimates of S aureus 
bacteremia range from 6 to 20 per 
100 000 children. 
19, 
20 In contrast, at 
KPNC our rates of S aureus bacteremia 
were 3.5 (95% CI, 1.1–8.7) per 100 000 
children per year. Our lower rates are 
probably multifactorial. We included 
only previously healthy children with 
blood collected in an outpatient clinic, 
in an ED, or in the first 24 hours of 
hospitalization. Rates of MRSA are 
lower in northern California compared 
with other parts of the United States. 
36 
At KPNC only 10% of pediatric S aureus 
bacteremia cases are due to MRSA. Our 
N meningitidis bacteremia rates of 0.2 
per 100 000 children are consistent 
with the national estimate of 0.3 per 
100 000 children. 
26
As rates of all bacteremia per 100 000 
children per year in the post-PCV13 
study period decreased, there was an 
increase in all bacteremia per 10 000 
blood cultures compared with the 
post-PCV7/pre-PCV13 period. Rates 
of S pneumoniae bacteremia steadily 
declined per 10 000 blood cultures 
over the 3 study periods. In contrast, 
rates of E coli, Salmonella spp, and S 
aureus bacteremia per 10 000 blood 
cultures increased. Changes to the 
former were associated with the 
impact of immunization, but changes 
to the latter were associated with the 
impact of changing practices, most 
notably the trend toward fewer blood 
cultures.
In the final study period (post-PCV13), 
76% of bacteremia occurred with 
a source, most frequently urine, 
gastrointestinal, lung, bone, or skin and 
soft tissue. Ribitzky-Eisner et al 
35 in 
Israel found a similar post-PCV13 rate, 
with 80% of bacteremia occurring with 
a source. Because bacteremia in the 
post-PCV13 era is more likely to occur 
with a source, a focused examination 
should be performed and appropriate 
studies obtained at the time of a blood 
culture collection.
Given the low frequency of bacteremia 
in children 3 to 36 months old, several 
authors have recommended obtaining 
fewer blood cultures in young febrile 
children. 
1, 
 
4, 
 
37 The total number of 
blood cultures obtained in outpatient 
clinics at KPNC declined by more than 
one-third from 1998 to 2003. 
1 But 
over the same period, similar to Simon 
et al, 
38 we found no decline in blood 
culture acquisition rates in children 
presenting to the ED. In contrast, 
from 1998 to 2014, physicians in both 
the outpatient clinic and ED changed 
their behavior. The total number of 
annual blood cultures dropped 68%, 
including a drop of 45% in the ED. It 
is likely that this reduction in blood 
culture acquisition was caused by 
both a decrease in bacteremic (ie, 
“sick appearing”) children and a 
decreased suspicion of bacteremia as 
a result of the physicians’ knowledge 
about the effectiveness of the current 
immunizations.
Site of culture acquisition (outpatient 
clinic, ED, or first 24 hours of 
hospitalization) was not a predictor 
for bacteremia. Several publications 
have focused on rates of bacteremia 
in children presenting to the ED, 
 
6 
 
– 
9, 
17 
with few publications focusing on 
children with blood cultures collected 
in both the outpatient clinic and the 
ED. 
1, 
 
4 These findings highlight the 
need for vigilance about bacteremia 
in all settings and suggest that many 
previously healthy children with 
bacteremia are not so sick as to 
need initial care in the ED. Although 
site of culture acquisition was not 
a predictor of all bacteremia, we 
continued to find that compared with 
outpatient blood cultures, cultures 
from the ED and the first 24 hours of 
hospitalization were more likely to be 
contaminants (P < .001). We suspect 
the higher rates of contamination are 
due to technique and less familiarity 
with pediatric blood draws.
Our study had some limitations. Our 
denominator was not febrile children 
presenting for care. Instead, we used 
the surrogates of rate per study 
population per year and rate per 
number of blood cultures acquired. 
Although most KPNC members 
receive all their care from a KPNC 
facility, a small proportion of children 
(estimated at <1% [A. Herz, personal 
communication, December 15, 2016]) 
may have been seen elsewhere. If a 
child was ill, the child would probably 
return to a KPNC facility for follow-up. 
KPNC members were similar to the 
insured population and general 
population in northern California 
with regard to sociodemographic and 
health characteristics, but they differ 
in several ways from a population that 
includes those with Medi-Cal coverage 
and the uninsured. 
39 
 
 
–43 Despite these 
limitations, given the occurrence of 
bacteremia in this age group and the 
large population of KPNC, it is likely 
that our study accurately reported 
incidence rates of and risk factors for 
bacteremia in the general population.
CONCLUSIONS
Bacteremia in healthy children 
3 to 36 months old is rare in 
the post-PCV13 era. The most 
common pathogens identified in 
blood cultures today are E coli, 
Salmonella spp, and S aureus. Because 
bacteremia in the post-PCV13 era is 
more likely to occur with a source, 
a focused examination should be 
performed and appropriate studies 
should be obtained at the time of a 
blood culture collection.
