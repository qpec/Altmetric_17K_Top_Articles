G
out is the most common type of inflammatory arthritis, 
affecting 2.4% of adults in the United Kingdom.1 It has been 
hypothesized that, in common with other chronic inflam-
matory arthritides such as rheumatoid arthritis and spondyloar-
thropathy,2,3 gout may be associated with an increased risk of frac-
ture, primarily owing to the negative effects of chronic inflammation 
on bone, because proinflammatory cytokines are known to induce 
bone loss. However, the effects of serum urate on bone health are 
still under debate4,5 and previous studies that have assessed the 
impact of gout and urate-lowering therapy on fracture risk have pro-
vided conflicting results. For instance, a population-based study 
from Taiwan6 found a 17% increased risk of fracture among patients 
with gout and reported lower fracture risk among those prescribed 
urate-lowering therapy. In contrast, a registry-based study from Den-
mark7 found a 9% higher risk of fracture among patients prescribed 
allopurinol compared with patients who were not. A study in the 
United States8 concluded that gout has no effect on the risk of non-
vertebral fracture. Two of the studies were based on large adminis-
trative data6,7 but failed to take into account lifestyle-related factors 
such as body mass index (BMI) and alcohol consumption; they also 
did not adequately address selection bias associated with potentially 
delayed urate-lowering therapy after diagnosis,9 which may have 
affected their overall conclusions. Fragility fractures are associated 
with increased cost of health care10,11 and a substantial cause of mor-
bidity. Therefore, the aim of this study was to quantify precisely the 
risk of fracture among patients with gout in the UK and assess the 
potential effect of urate-lowering therapy on fracture risk estimates 
using a large population-based primary health care database.
Methods
Data source, design and setting
We used the Clinical Practice Research Datalink,12 a large database 
containing UK primary care medical records of anonymized patients 
(supplementary data, section on Clinical Practice Research Datalink

UK population in terms of age, sex, ethnicity and lifestyle-related 
characteristics.13,14 We identified individuals with a first-ever recorded

ABSTRACT
BACKGROUND: Previous studies that 
quantified the risk of fracture among 
patients with gout and assessed the 
potential effect of urate-lowering ther-
apy have provided conflicting results. 
Our study aims to provide better esti-
mates of risk by minimizing the effect of 
selection bias and confounding on the 
observed association.
METHODS: We used data from the Clin-
ical Practice Research Datalink, which 
records primary care consultations of 
patients from across the United King-
dom. We identified patients with inci-
dent gout from 1990 to 2004 and fol-
lowed them up until 2015. Each patient 
with gout was individually matched to 
4 controls on age, sex and general 
practice. We calculated absolute rate 
of fracture and hazard ratios (HRs) 
using Cox regression models. Among 
patients with gout, we assessed the 
impact of urate-lowering therapy on 
fracture, and used landmark analysis 
and propensity score matching to 
account for immortal time bias and 
confounding by indication.
RESULTS: We identified 31 781 patients 
with incident gout matched to 122 961 
controls. The absolute rate of fracture 
was similar in both cases and controls 
(absolute rate = 53 and 55 per 10 000 
person-years, respectively) corre-
sponding to an HR of 0.97 (95% confi-
dence interval 0.92–1.02). Our finding 
remained unchanged when we strati-
fied our analysis by age and sex. We did 
not observe statistically significant dif-
ferences in the risk of fracture among 
those prescribed urate-lowering ther-
apy within 1 and 3 years after gout 
diagnosis.
INTERPRETATION: Overall, gout was not 
associated with an increased risk of 
fracture. Urate-lowering drugs pre-
scribed early during the course of dis-
ease had neither adverse nor beneficial 
effect on the long-term risk of fracture.

and 2004, who were then followed up until 2015. The diagnosis of 
gout was based on a medical code assigned by the physician, which 
has been previously validated in the Clinical Practice Research Data-
link and has a positive predictive value of 90%.15 Each patient was 
assigned an index date that corresponded to the date of their diag-
nosis of gout and randomly matched to 4 controls, who did not have 
a diagnosis of gout or evidence of urate-lowering therapy, who were 
registered at the same practice and were alive and contributing data 
at the index date. They were matched on age (± 3 yr) and sex. Con-
trols were assigned the same index date as their matched gout case. 
For both cases and controls, follow-up commenced from the index 
date. Those with a history of fragility fracture, less than 1 year of 
 
follow-up before the index date or less than 3 years of follow-up after 
index date were excluded from the study.
The event of interest was time from the index date until the 
first diagnosis of fracture. Medical codes for fractures at sites of 
major osteoporotic fracture were selected (vertebrae, humerus, 
wrist and hip) in addition to codes for fragility fractures of unspec-
ified site. For the purpose of this study, we were interested only in 
the incidence of first fracture; thus, all subsequent fracture events 
were ignored. Van Staa and colleagues16 carried out external vali-
dation of fracture diagnosis in the Clinical Practice Research Data-
link and found that 88% and 91% of vertebral and hip fracture 
diagnoses, respectively, were verified by physicians.
For each individual in our study, we extracted information on rel-
evant lifestyle-related characteristics (smoking status and alcohol 
consumption), BMI and comorbidities (defined using the Charlson 
index).17 We also extracted information on selected medication use 
(antihypertensive agents, antidiabetic agents, opioids, glucocorti-
coids, proton pump inhibitors, selective serotonin reuptake inhibi-
tors and bisphosphonates) and history of falls. We ascertained infor-
mation on comorbidities and lifestyle-related characteristics within 
5 years, and on medication use within 1 year before the index date. 
As the timing of beginning urate-lowering therapy varies after diag-
nosis of gout, we used landmark analysis to examine the effect of 
urate-lowering therapy on the risk of first fracture among patients 
with gout.18 This method deals with immortal time bias, which biases 
the results in favour of the treatment under study, by granting a false 
survival advantage to the treated group. In landmark analysis,19 a 
fixed time after the start of therapy is selected for conducting survival 
analysis (Figure 1). Only patients who were alive and contributing 
data at landmark time were included in the analysis. The exposure 
(urate-lowering therapy) was evaluated between the index date and 
the landmark time, whereas a fracture event was considered only 
after the landmark time point. Two landmark points were considered 
in the analysis (1 and 3 yr after diagnosis), based on a previously pub-
lished study.20 Only patients who were prescribed more than 
6 months of urate-lowering therapy were considered to be exposed.
Statistical analysis
We calculated the incidence of fracture as the number of first 
recorded fractures per 10 000 person-years. Using a Cox regression 
model, we calculated hazard ratios (HRs) and 95% confidence inter-
vals (CIs), comparing the risk of fracture between gout cases and con-
trols adjusted for various covariates. We accounted for clustering by 
practice by using robust standard errors. We imputed missing values 
of BMI by multiple imputation using chained equations. The propor-
tional hazard assumption was tested using Schoenfeld residuals. We 
stratified our analysis by age, sex and fracture site. To assess the 
effect of urate-lowering therapy on fracture risk among those with 
gout, we used propensity score matching methods to account for 
confounding by indication. The propensity score for urate-lowering 
therapy represents the probability that a patient is prescribed the 
therapy for at least 6 months during the exposure window, given 
their observed covariates (described further in Appendix 1). A logistic 
regression model was used to estimate propensity scores; subse-
quently, each patient with gout who was exposed to urate-lowering 
therapy was matched to 1 patient with gout who had not been 
exposed to the therapy, based on their propensity score with caliper 
distance of 0.2.19 We used a greedy algorithm to select matches: i.e., 
we selected the closest matching first, then the closest remaining 
matching, until there were no acceptable matches. We separately 
compared the risk of fracture among those who received more than 
6 months of urate-lowering therapy within a 1- and 3-year exposure 
window compared with their matched controls who had not been 
exposed to urate-lowering therapy during that period, using a Cox 
regression model. We conducted all analyses using Stata version 14.

Results
We identified 31 781 cases of patients with incident gout who 
were matched to 122 961 controls. The median follow-up for our 
study was 10.8 years (interquartile range [IQR] 6.8–13.6 yr). The 
characteristics of the study population are summarized in 
Table 1. A total of 8934 patients sustained a first fragility fracture 
at some point during the follow-up period. The absolute rate of 
fracture among gout cases and controls was 53 and 55 per 10 000 
person-years, respectively (Table 2). Compared with controls, we 
found no excess risk of fracture among patients with gout 
(HR 0.97, 95% CI 0.92–1.02). These findings remained consistent

when we stratified our analysis by age. Although women had 
higher absolute risk of fracture than men, their excess risk com-
pared with their matched controls was not statistically significant 
(HR 0.96, 95% CI 0.89–1.02). Compared with controls, patients 
with gout had no increased risk of vertebral or nonvertebral frac-
tures (Supplementary Table 1, Appendix 1). For our 1-year land-
mark analysis, we included 31 668 patients with incident gout 
(Figure 2) who did not die, transfer out of the practice or have a 
fracture within the exposure window. The baseline characteristics 
of patients who were exposed and those who were not exposed to 
urate-lowering therapy within 1 year after gout diagnosis are 
summarized in Supplementary Table 2 (Appendix 1). After pro-
pensity score matching, we found no difference in the baseline 
characteristics by status of exposure to urate-lowering therapy, 
which shows the quality of our matching (Supplementary Table 3, 
Appendix 1). There was no difference in the risk of long-term frac-
ture among those who were exposed and were not exposed to at 
least 6 months of urate-lowering therapy within a year of their 
diagnosis of gout (HR 1.01, 95% CI 0.84–1.22) (Table 3). We also 
observed similar findings in our 3-year landmark analysis.
Interpretation
Using data from a large, nationally representative cohort, we 
compared the risk of fragility fracture (composite of vertebral 
and nonvertebral fracture) observed among patients with inci-
dent gout to the general population. Overall, gout was not asso-
ciated with an increased risk of vertebral or nonvertebral facture. 
These findings were consistent when we stratified our analysis by 
age and sex. Among those with incident gout, we found that hav-
ing at least 6 months of urate-lowering therapy within 1 and 
3 years of diagnosis had neither adverse nor beneficial effect on 
the long-term risk of fragility fractures compared with receiving 
no or less than 6 months of urate-lowering therapy.
We found no association between gout and the risk of fragility 
fracture. This finding is in contrast to a Taiwanese study that 
reported a statistically significant 17% higher risk of fracture among 
patients with gout compared with their matched controls.6 This may 
be a result of the difference in the study population and outcome 
definition used. For instance, our study focused primarily on fragility 
fractures, whereas the Taiwanese study included all types of frac-
tures, including fracture of ankle or foot, which accounted for 15% 
of all fractures in that study’s gout cohort and had the largest excess 
risk (34%). The neutral effect of gout remained when we stratified 
our analysis by fracture site. This finding is consistent with other 
studies.6,8 Although Tzeng and colleagues6 found a 14% increased 
risk of vertebral fracture, their study failed to take into account 
important lifestyle-related factors (BMI, smoking status and alcohol 
consumption), which may have confounded their finding. 
Although women are more likely to sustain fragility fractures 
than men, few studies provide risk estimates by sex.6–8 A US-based 
study21 reported positive associations between gout and inci-
dence of hip and wrist fracture in women, with an adjusted excess 
risk of 12% and 38%, respectively. Although this study refutes our 
findings, it used self-reported information on both gout and frac-
ture, which may have introduced bias. Furthermore, their study 
findings may not be generalizable to the wider population, 
because they were based exclusively on a cohort of nurses.
We found that urate-lowering therapy had neither a beneficial nor 
adverse effect on the long-term risk of fragility fracture. The existing 
literature on the topic is conflicting6,7,22 and, unlike our study, does 
not address the issues of immortal time bias or confounding by indi-
cation. For instance, Dennison and colleagues7 reported 9% excess 
risk of osteoporotic fractures among those prescribed allopurinol 
compared with nonusers. Although these authors used propensity 
score matching, there were still significant differences in the baseline 
characteristics and comorbidities between groups that were exposed 
and not exposed. Moreover, their controls may have included

patients who did not have gout, which may have affected their 
observed association. In contrast, Tzeng and colleagues6 reported 
28% lower risk of fracture among patients with gout who were pre-
scribed urate-lowering therapy compared with those who were not 
prescribed the therapy. However, this study overlooked that patients 
receiving urate-lowering therapy must be event-free from the time of 
gout diagnosis to the time of the first prescription of urate-lowering 
therapy be considered exposed, whereas no such requirement is 
necessary for the unexposed group.
Strengths and limitations
Using data from primary care in the UK, we conducted one of the 
largest studies with more than 25 years of follow-up to quantify 
the occurrence of fragility fracture among patients with gout 
compared with a matched group of individuals without gout in a 
contemporary population-based manner. Our use of a nationally 
representative cohort should enable our study findings to be 
generalizable not only to the UK but also to other developed 
countries with similar health care systems. Furthermore, the

prospective nature of the data recording enables us to under-
stand better the temporal relationship between exposure and 
outcome with minimum bias.
However, our study has several limitations. Our reliance on 
physicians to make the diagnosis of gout, rather than using the 
gold standard of visualization of monosodium urate crystals in 
joint fluid or identification of tophi on examination, could have led 
to misclassification. However, the diagnosis of gout has been pre-
viously validated in the Clinical Practice Research Datalink with 
high accuracy;15 it is therefore unlikely that there is any major error 
in our findings resulting from misclassification of our cases. The 
findings of this validation study are consistent with another study 
in which 83% of cases of gout diagnosed by general practitioners 
were independently validated by a rheumatologist on clinical 
grounds.23 Although this previous study found a high positive pre-
dictive value, it did not give an indication of negative predictive 
value (or sensitivity), and there is a possibility of missing cases that 
may have been diagnosed in a specialized setting. However, this is 
unlikely, because gout is managed principally in primary care. Fur-
thermore, a recent study using a similar database has shown 
higher prevalence of gout1 than previously reported. Therefore, we 
believe it is unlikely that there is any major error in our findings 
resulting from misclassification of our cases. 
Similar misclassification may also exist for fracture diagnosis, 
although recording of fracture has also been validated in the 
Clinical Practice Research Datalink;16 differential recording in the 
diagnosis of fracture among cases and controls is unlikely. 
Finally, the use of 1- and 3-year landmarks for our urate-lowering 
therapy analysis means that our findings can be generalized only 
to those who were alive and contributing data at those landmark 
points, who did not develop fracture within the exposure window 
and who were prescribed at least 6 months of urate-lowering 
therapy after their initial diagnosis of gout.
Conclusion
We found no excess risk of fragility fractures among patients 
with gout. Our findings remained consistent when we stratified 
our analysis by age, sex and fracture site. Our propensity 
score–matched landmark analyses showed that prescription of 
at least 6 months of urate-lowering therapy within 1 and 
3 years of patients’ initial diagnosis of gout had neither benefi-
cial nor adverse effects on long-term risk of fracture. These 
findings should be reassuring to patients, health care policy-
makers and clinicians.
