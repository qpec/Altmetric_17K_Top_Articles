IMPORTANCE The comparative clinical benefit of nonstatin therapies that reduce low-density
lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C) remains uncertain.
OBJECTIVE To evaluate the association between lowering LDL-C and relative cardiovascular
risk reduction across different statin and nonstatin therapies.
DATA SOURCES AND STUDY SELECTION The MEDLINE and EMBASE databases were searched
(1966-July 2016). The key inclusion criteria were that the study was a randomized clinical trial
and the reported clinical outcomes included myocardial infarction (MI). Studies were
excluded if the duration was less than 6 months or had fewer than 50 clinical events. Studies
of 9 different types of LDL-C reduction approaches were included.
DATA EXTRACTION AND SYNTHESIS Two authors independently extracted and entered data
into standardized data sheets and data were analyzed using meta-regression.
MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES The relative risk (RR) of major vascular events (a composite
of cardiovascular death, acute MI or other acute coronary syndrome, coronary
revascularization, or stroke) associated with the absolute reduction in LDL-C level; 5-year rate
of major coronary events (coronary death or MI) associated with achieved LDL-C level.
RESULTS A total of 312 175 participants (mean age, 62 years; 24% women; mean baseline LDL-C
level of 3.16 mmol/L [122.3 mg/dL]) from 49 trials with 39 645 major vascular events were
included. The RR for major vascular events per 1-mmol/L (38.7-mg/dL) reduction in LDL-C level
was 0.77 (95% CI, 0.71-0.84; P < .001) for statins and 0.75 (95% CI, 0.66-0.86; P = .002) for
established nonstatin interventions that work primarily via upregulation of LDL receptor
expression (ie, diet, bile acid sequestrants, ileal bypass, and ezetimibe) (between-group
difference, P = .72). For these 5 therapies combined, the RR was 0.77 (95% CI, 0.75-0.79,
P < .001) for major vascular events per 1-mmol/L reduction in LDL-C level. For other
interventions, the observed RRs vs the expected RRs based on the degree of LDL-C reduction in
the trials were 0.94 (95% CI, 0.89-0.99) vs 0.91 (95% CI, 0.90-0.92) for niacin (P = .24); 0.88
(95% CI, 0.83-0.92) vs 0.94 (95% CI, 0.93-0.94) for fibrates (P = .02), which was lower than
expected (ie, greater risk reduction); 1.01 (95% CI, 0.94-1.09) vs 0.90 (95% CI, 0.89-0.91) for
cholesteryl ester transfer protein inhibitors (P = .002), which was higher than expected (ie, less
risk reduction); and 0.49 (95% CI, 0.34-0.71) vs 0.61 (95% CI, 0.58-0.65) for proprotein
convertase subtilisin/kexin type 9 inhibitors (P = .25). The achieved absolute LDL-C level was
significantly associated with the absolute rate of major coronary events (11 301 events, including
coronary death or MI) for primary prevention trials (1.5% lower event rate [95% CI, 0.5%-2.6%]
per each 1-mmol/L lower LDL-C level; P = .008) and secondary prevention trials (4.6% lower
event rate [95% CI, 2.9%-6.4%] per each 1-mmol/L lower LDL-C level; P < .001).
CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE In this meta-regression analysis, the use of statin and
nonstatin therapies that act via upregulation of LDL receptor expression to reduce LDL-C
were associated with similar RRs of major vascular events per change in LDL-C. Lower
achieved LDL-C levels were associated with lower rates of major coronary events.

L
ow-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C) is a well-
established risk factor for cardiovascular disease, as evi-
denced by epidemiological and Mendelian randomiza-
tionstudies.RecognizingtheimportanceofLDL-C,theNational
Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute formed the National Choles-
terol Education Program more than 30 years ago to educate
both the medical community and the general public about the
need to lower levels of blood cholesterol to reduce the risk of
major vascular events.1
Although there is consensus about the value of lowering
LDL-C,recommendationsabouthowtodosohaveshiftedover
time.2-5 The clinical benefit of lowering LDL-C with statins re-
mains widely accepted, as does the concept demonstrated by
theCholesterolTreatmentTrialists’Collaborationthatthemag-
nitude of clinical benefit observed with statins is propor-
tionaltotheabsolutereductioninLDL-C.6Incontrast,theclini-
cal benefit of the previously recommended use of nonstatin
therapies to lower LDL-C is less definitive.7
The 2013 American College of Cardiology/American Heart
Associationguidelineonthetreatmentofbloodcholesterolem-
phasized the use of statins to lower LDL-C,3 whereas a more
recent American College of Cardiology expert consensus docu-
ment recommended considering adding certain nonstatin
therapies to lower LDL-C, such as bile acid sequestrants, ezeti-
mibe, and proprotein convertase subtilisin/kexin type 9
(PCSK9) inhibitors.5 The use of niacin, fibrates, or both is not
recommended, which parallels the recent withdrawal by the
US Food and Drug Administration of approval for niacin and
fibratesincombinationwithastatin.8Thepurposeofthismeta-
regression analysis was to evaluate the association between
lowering LDL-C and cardiovascular risk reduction across dif-
ferent therapies to lower LDL-C.
Methods
A systematic review and trial-level meta-regression analysis
ofrandomizedclinicaltrialsthatevaluatedtheeffectoftherapy
tolowerLDL-Concardiovascularoutcomeswasperformedand
the results are reported according to the Preferred Reporting
Items for Systematic reviews and Meta-Analyses guidelines.9
Potential trials were identified from (1) MEDLINE and EMBASE
using the search terms LDL lowering and clinical outcomes, lim-
ited to randomized controlled trials and human and published
between 1966 and July 2016 (eMethods in the Supplement);
(2) the reference files of M.G.S. and M.S.S.; (3) reference lists
of original articles, reviews, and meta-analyses; (4) a review
of abstracts of major cardiovascular meetings held during the
past 2 years; and (5) by contacting experts.
The following inclusion criteria were required to be eli-
gible for the meta-regression analysis: (1) randomized clinical
trial; (2) single intervention difference between the experi-
mental and control group (which could either be therapy to
lower LDL-C vs no therapy or, for 6 trials, more intensive vs
less intensive statin therapy); and (3) reported clinical cardio-
vascular outcomes that at least included myocardial infarc-
tion (MI). Trials were excluded for the following reasons:
(1) duration of less than 6 months (a timeframe during which
a clinical benefit of lipid-lowering therapy would not be
expected to emerge10); (2) fewer than 50 clinical events dur-
ing the course of the trial (to exclude small trials with unreli-
able hazard ratios); (3) study population focused on partici-
pants with significant competing risks (ie, heart failure or
chronic kidney disease because lipid-lowering therapy has
been shown to be less clinically effective due to competing
nonatherosclerotic risks6); or (4) experimental intervention
with known off-target adverse effects on cardiovascular out-
comes (which would impair the ability to judge the benefit of
the LDL-C reduction).
The following information was obtained from each trial
using a structured form independently by 2 of the authors
(M.G.S. and M.S.S.): sample size, whether the trial studied a
primary or secondary prevention population, intervention
and comparison therapy, trial duration, reduction in LDL-C
levels and non–high-density lipoprotein cholesterol (non-
HDL-C) levels in each group, achieved LDL-C levels in each
treatment group and the difference between groups, absolute
major vascular and coronary event rates in both treatment
groups, and hazard ratios (or risk ratios in trials that did not
report hazard ratios) with 95% CIs for the treatment effect. In
the earlier trials that did not report LDL-C levels, LDL-C
values at baseline and while in the study were estimated
from total cholesterol levels (the Supplement provides addi-
tional details).
Outcomes from each trial were selected to most closely ap-
proximate the target composite end point of major vascular
events, which consisted of cardiovascular death, acute MI or
other acute coronary syndrome, coronary revascularization,
and stroke when available because all these events have been
shown to be reduced by therapies to lower LDL-C. In some in-
stances, the selected outcome that best matched the target
composite was a secondary composite end point for the origi-
nal trial. The specific outcome selected for each trial is listed
in eTables 1-9 in the Supplement. All disagreements were dis-
cussed and resolved by consensus.
The interventions were divided into 4 groups: (1) statins;
(2) nonstatin therapies that ultimately lower LDL-C predomi-
Key Points
Question What is the association between lowering low-density
lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C) and cardiovascular risk reduction
across different therapeutic interventions?
Findings In a meta-regression analysis of 49 clinical trials with
312 175 participants, each 1-mmol/L (38.7-mg/dL) reduction in
LDL-C level was associated with a relative risk (RR) of major
vascular events of 0.77 (95% CI, 0.71-0.84; P < .001) for statins
and 0.75 (95% CI, 0.66-0.86; P = .002) for established nonstatin
interventions that act primarily via upregulation of LDL receptor
expression.
Meaning These data suggest statins and nonstatin therapies that
act through upregulation of LDL receptor expression are
associated with similar cardiovascular risk reduction per decrease
in LDL-C. The clinical value of adding specific nonstatin
interventions to lower LDL-C to background statin therapy should
be confirmed in appropriately powered clinical trials.

nantly by lowering intrahepatic cholesterol, thereby leading
to upregulation of LDL receptor expression, and have been
studied in dedicated cardiovascular outcomes trials (ie, diet,
bile acid sequestrants, ileal bypass surgery, and ezetimibe)11-14;
(3) interventions that do not reduce LDL-C levels primarily
through upregulation of LDL receptor expression (ie, fi-
brates, niacin, cholesteryl ester transfer protein [CETP]
inhibitors)15-17; and (4) PCSK9 inhibitors, which upregulate
LDL-C clearance through the LDL receptor,18 but for which
dedicatedcardiovascularoutcometrialshavenotyetbeencom-
pleted (and therefore were considered separately to evaluate
how the data to date compare with established therapies that
upregulate LDL receptor expression).
The association between the absolute amount of LDL-C
reduction of an intervention (calculated as the difference in
achieved LDL-C levels between the 2 treatment groups) and
the hazard or risk ratio for major vascular events with that
intervention was evaluated. The hazard ratios were subse-
quently treated as risk ratios when the results of studies were
pooled and then the term risk ratio was used to describe the
effect estimate. Meta-regression analyses were performed
using random-effects models with the restricted maximum
likelihood estimation estimator for between-study variability
and the Knapp and Hartung adjustment for estimation of
standard errors of the estimated coefficients to calculate
summary effect estimates (which are presented as relative
risk (RR) with 95% CIs, P values, and R2 values (a measure of
the proportion of between-study variability accounted for by
the variable).19,20 For statin trials, an additional meta-
regression analysis was performed to evaluate the associa-
tion between the percentage (rather than the absolute) of
LDL-C reduction for an intervention and the RR for major
vascular events with the intervention. Two-sample z testing
was performed to compare the effect sizes per each 1-mmol/L
(38.7-mg/dL) reduction in LDL-C level between the different
treatment types.
A random-effects meta-regression with the intercept set
at 0 was used to estimate the RR per each 1-mmol/L reduc-
tion in LDL-C level for the combination of statins and nonsta-
tin therapies that act predominantly via upregulation of LDL
receptor expression and have been studied in dedicated car-
diovascular outcomes trials. The mean weighted LDL-C re-
duction, RR, and 95% CI were then estimated for each of the
9 treatment types separately using fixed-effects meta-
analysis with weighting by inverse variance and plotted rela-
tive to the meta-regression line. Two-sample z testing was per-
formed to compare the observed RR for each of the 9
interventions with the regression line to evaluate for possible
differences in estimated effect size per unit reduction in LDL-C
by treatment type. Analogous analyses were performed using
non-HDL-C instead of LDL-C.
The association between the achieved LDL-C level and the
estimated5-yearrateofmajorcoronaryevents(coronarydeath
or MI) was evaluated using random-effects meta-regression
analysis of the data from each group (experimental and con-
trol) in more recent trials of statins and established nonstatin
therapies that ultimately act predominantly via upregulation
of LDL receptor expression and that had the necessary infor-
mationavailable(eMethodsintheSupplement).Forthisanaly-
sis, trials were divided into primary prevention vs secondary
or mixed prevention (excluding studies of patients with acute
coronarysyndromesgiventhenonlinearaccrualofevents)par-
ticipant populations.
Assessments of the study quality, consistency of results,

sitivity analyses appear in the eMethods.
Statistical significance was assessed at a nominal α level
of .05. All reported P values are 2-sided. Statistical analyses
were performed using the Metafor package version 3.30 (R
Project for Statistical Computing)20 and the Comprehensive
Meta Analyses version 3.3.070 (Biostat Inc).
Results
A total of 240 citations were identified and reviewed for eligi-
bility (Figure 1) and 49 trials, spanning 9 different treatment
modalities were included in the meta-regression analysis
(Table21-25 and eTables 1-9 in the Supplement). There were 25
statin trials. There were 8 trials of established nonstatin
therapies that ultimately act predominantly via upregulation
of LDL receptor expression (4 diet trials, 2 trials of bile acid
sequestrants, 1 trial of ileal bypass surgery, and 1 trial of ezeti-
mibe). There were 15 trials of interventions that do not
reduce LDL-C levels primarily through upregulation of LDL
receptor expression (9 trials with fibrates, 3 trials with niacin
[1 of which was a multigroup trial that also studied fibrates],
and 3 trials with CETP inhibitors). There were 2 trials with
PCSK9 inhibitors. These trials included a total of 312 175 par-
ticipants with 39 645 major vascular events. The mean
follow-up was 4.3 years, resulting in approximately 1.3 mil-
lion person-years of follow-up.
For the 25 statin trials, each 1-mmol/L (38.7-mg/dL) reduc-
tion in LDL-C level was associated with an RR of 0.77 (95% CI,
0.71-0.84; P < .001) for major vascular events (Figure 2A).26-48
The results were similar in patient populations in the primary
prevention trials (RR per 1-mmol/L reduction in LDL-C, 0.70
[95% CI, 0.53-0.93]) and in the secondary prevention trials (RR
per 1-mmol/L reduction in LDL-C, 0.79 [95% CI, 0.73-0.86])
(eFigures 1 and 2 in the Supplement). The absolute reduction
in LDL-C accounted for 98% of the between-study variability
(R2 value) in the reduction of major vascular events, whereas
the percentage reduction in LDL-C only accounted for 79%.
A similar association between absolute lowering of LDL-C
and the RR for major vascular events was seen in the 8 trials
of established nonstatin therapies that ultimately act predomi-
nantly via upregulation of LDL receptor expression. Specifi-
cally, each 1-mmol/L reduction in LDL-C was associated with
an RR of 0.75 (95% CI, 0.66-0.86; P = .002) in major vascular
events (P = .72 for between-group difference with statin
therapy) (Figure 2B).49-54
Combiningthedatafromall33oftheaforementionedtrials
generated the meta-regression line (predicted RR of major vas-
cular events for various levels of LDL-C reduction) in Figure 3,
in which each 1-mmol/L reduction in LDL-C was associated
withanRRof0.77(95%CI,0.75-0.79)inmajorvascularevents.

A summary of each intervention is plotted on the graph based
ontheweightedbetween-groupdifferenceinLDL-Cinthetrials
and the weighted RR of major vascular events calculated from
the meta-analyses (eFigures 3-12 in the Supplement). The ob-
served RR of major vascular events for each of the 5 different
established interventions that ultimately act predominantly
through upregulation of LDL receptor expression (ie, statins,
diet, bile acid sequestrants, ileal bypass, and ezetimibe) was
within 0.02 (ie, 2%) of the predicted value from the regres-
sion line, suggesting consistent clinical benefit normalized to
the magnitude of LDL-C reduction, regardless of the treat-
ment class.
In terms of the other interventions, the observed RR of
0.94 (95% CI, 0.89-0.99) for major vascular events for niacin
was greater (ie, less risk reduction) than the expected RR
from meta-regression of 0.91 (95% CI, 0.90-0.92; P = .24),
but with 95% CIs that encompass the regression line and
z score testing showing no significant difference (P = .24).
The observed RR of 0.88 (95% CI, 0.83-0.92) for fibrates was
lower (ie, greater risk reduction) than the expected RR of
0.94 (95% CI, 0.93-0.94) (P = .02). Fibrates also substantially
reduce levels of very low-density lipoprotein, an atherogenic
particle that contains both cholesterol and triglycerides.
When recalculating the regression slope using non-HDL-C,
the RR per 1-mmol/L reduction in non-HDL-C was 0.80 (95%
CI, 0.77-0.82), which was similar to the RR with LDL-C reduc-
tion. The observed RR associated with fibrates was shifted to
the right and was no longer statistically significantly different
than the expected RR from the regression line for non-HDL-C
(eFigure 13 in the Supplement). There was a significant asso-
ciation between the degree of lowering for triglycerides and
the RR of major vascular events with fibrates (eFigure 14 in
the Supplement).
TheobservedRRof1.01(95%CI,0.94-1.09)associatedwith
CETP inhibitors was significantly greater than the expected RR
of 0.90 (95% CI, 0.89-0.91; P = .002) (ie, less risk reduction)
with no appreciable clinical benefit in a meta-analysis of the
compounds studied to date. In a sensitivity analysis in which
the LDL-C reductions were adjusted for potential inaccura-
cies stemming from use of the Friedewald equation,55 the ef-
fect estimate still differed from the meta-regression line
(P = .01). The estimated RR of 0.49 (95% CI, 0.34-0.71) asso-
ciated with PCSK9 inhibitors was numerically lower, but not
significantly different, than the expected RR of 0.61 (95% CI,
0.58-0.65), with wide 95% CIs that included the regression line
(P = .25).
There was a significant association between the ob-
served absolute achieved LDL-C and the 5-year rates of major
coronary events (coronary death or MI, n = 11 301) in the in-
tervention and control groups among the trials of statins and
established nonstatin therapies that ultimately act predomi-
nantly via upregulation of LDL receptor expression (eTable 10
in the Supplement). This association was seen in primary pre-
vention trials (1.5% lower event rate [95% CI, 0.5%-2.6%] per
1-mmol/L lower LDL-C; P = .008) and secondary prevention
trials(4.6%lowereventrate[95%CI,2.9%-6.4%]per1-mmol/L
lowerLDL-C;P < .001)(Figure4).BaselineLDL-Cwasnotasig-
nificant variable in either of these models.
A review of study quality and analyses for heterogeneity
of results and publication bias are provided in eTable 11
through eTable 20 in the Supplement. No significant hetero-
geneity was seen. There was no evidence for substantively
important publication bias. A series of sensitivity analyses
are reported in the eResults in the Supplement and showed
no substantive differences.
Discussion
In this systematic review and meta-regression analysis of 49
trials involving 9 different interventions to lower LDL-C that
included more than 300 000 patients and approximately
40 000 major vascular events, there was a similar association

between absolute reductions in LDL-C and lower RRs for
major vascular events across therapies that ultimately work
predominantly through upregulation of LDL receptor expres-
sion, such that each 1-mmol/L (38.7-mg/dL) reduction in
LDL-C was associated with an RR of 0.77 (ie, 23% relative
reduction) in the risk of major vascular events. There was
also a significant linear association between achieved LDL-C
and the rate of cardiovascular outcomes over the range of
LDL-C studied.
The implications of these results deserve careful consid-
eration in light of the strength of the available trial evidence
for different types of therapies. As per current guidelines,3,5
when tolerated, statins should be the first-line therapy given
the large reductions observed for LDL-C, the excellent safety
profile, the demonstrated clinical benefit, and low cost (now
that most are generic). However, the data in the present
meta-regression analysis raise the possibility that other inter-
ventions, especially those that ultimately act predominantly
through upregulation of LDL receptor expression, may pro-
vide additional options and may potentially be associated
with the same relative clinical benefit per each 1-mmol/L
reduction in LDL-C. This analysis builds on prior observa-
tions in a smaller number of trials,56,57 now expanded to sev-
eral additional classes of therapy. These findings are also sup-
ported by Mendelian randomization studies showing
a strong association between the degree of lower LDL-C
imparted by a genetic variant and the magnitude of the lower
cardiovascular outcome risk in carriers of that variant, irre-
spective of the gene.58
In addition to maximizing LDL-C reduction, cardiovascu-
lar risk assessment also remains a vital component of deci-
sion making because the absolute risk reduction in major
vascular events achieved with an intervention will be a func-
tion of the RR reduction (which depends on the absolute
degree of LDL-C lowering) and the baseline risk of cardiovas-
cular events. For example, a patient without known athero-
sclerotic cardiovascular disease who has a predicted risk of
major vascular events of 15% and of hard cardiovascular
events (cardiovascular death, MI, or stroke) of 10% within the
next 10 years, lowering LDL-C level by 1 mmol/L (38.7 mg/dL)
would be expected to result in absolute risk reductions of
approximately 3.5% and 2.3%, respectively. A patient with
known atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease who has
a predicted risk of major vascular events of 45% and of hard
cardiovascular events of 30% within the next 10 years, lower-
ing LDL-C level by 1 mmol/L would be expected to result in
absolute risk reductions of approximately 10% and 7%,
respectively.
Niacin and fibrates reduced major vascular events in
earlier trials, whereas more recent trials such as the Heart
Protection Study 2–Treatment of HDL to Reduce the Inci-
dence of Vascular Events (HPS2-Thrive),59 the Fenofibrate
Intervention and Event Lowering in Diabetes (FIELD),60 and
the Action to Control Cardiovascular Risk in Diabetes
(ACCORD)61 failed to achieve a statistically significant
reduction in their primary end points, calling into question
the clinical utility of these drugs. However, the observed RR
reduction in major vascular events was 4% (95% CI, −3% to
10%) in HPS2-Thrive, 11% (95% CI, 1% to 20%) in FIELD, and
8% (95% CI, −8% to 21%) in ACCORD, which were similar to
the RR reductions predicted from the meta-regression (7%,
9%, and 0%, respectively). Based purely on LDL-C lowering
and given the number of events accrued, the statistical
power for their primary end points was only approximately
51% for HPS2-Thrive, 19% for FIELD, and 3% for ACCORD.

a The Coronary Drug Project21 was a multigroup trial that studied both fibrates
and niacin individually compared with placebo. The participants and events in
the placebo group were only counted once for the total column.

the RR reduction for major vascular events was 6.4% (95%
CI, 1%-11%), with an absolute risk reduction of 2% over 7
years. The relatively small magnitude of the observed effect
reflects the low starting LDL-C level by design that yielded a
small absolute between-group difference, and is similar to
what was predicted from our meta-regression (8.3%) and the
Cholesterol Treatment Trialists’meta-regression of statin
trials.6 These results are also supported by genetic associa-
tion and Mendelian randomization studies demonstrating
similarly lower rates of cardiovascular outcomes per unit
lower LDL-C in patients with loss-of-function variants in the
Niemann-Pick C1-Like1 protein (the target of ezetimibe) and
in HMG-CoA reductase (the target of statins).62,63
These data suggest that drugs that ultimately reduce
LDL-C level predominantly through upregulation of LDL
receptor expression should, barring any off-target adverse
effects, lead to clinical benefit in proportion to the degree of
LDL-C reduction.64 This concept is further supported by
human genetic analyses of variants that have been associated
with low LDL-C, increased LDL receptors, and decreased
coronary heart disease.58,62,63,65 In contrast, LDL-C reduction
when not through increased clearance via the LDL receptor
or by decreased production, does not necessarily translate
into clinical benefit, as evidenced by the CETP inhibitor evac-
etrapib. In this case, the observed neutral result could have
stemmed from a neutral effect of the LDL-C reduction due to
the means by which it was lowered. However, the observed
results could also stem from the expected benefit of LDL-C
reduction being counterbalanced by an adverse effect of the
drug. These observations underscore that large, long-term
trials are ultimately necessary to provide adequate assurance
for safety, and this also applies to the case of the PCSK9
inhibitors, which are currently under active investigation.
This analysis has limitations that warrant acknowl-
edgment. First, the meta-analysis was not performed on
patient-level data. However, beyond the logistical complex-

ity of gathering such data from 49 trials conducted over 51
years, by definition the analyses were at the trial level,
examining the association between LDL-C reduction and
the RR of major vascular events within a trial. Second, the
absolute risk reduction observed in a given trial will depend
in part on the patient population, the end point, and the
duration of follow-up; therefore, the analysis was of relative
rather than absolute risk. As noted above, clinicians would
need to integrate the estimated RR reductions from these
analyses with a patient’
s baseline risk to estimate the antici-
pated absolute risk reduction. Several tools are available for
estimating patient risk.66-68 Third, the data for statins are
more extensive than the data for other interventions, with
more than 20 000 events from statin trials vs several thou-
sand events each for ezetimibe, niacin, fibrates, and CETP
inhibitor trials; several hundred events each for diet, bile
acid sequestrants, and ileal bypass trials; and only 2 trials
with 111 events during a mean follow-up of 1.2 years for the
PCSK9 inhibitor trials. Fourth, the studies included in the
analysis were conducted over a span of 51 years, and back-
ground therapy has changed, which may account for some
of the difference in absolute event rates between trials.

Fifth, the components of the composite of major vascular
events were not identical for every trial. Moreover, analysis
of composite end points from trials precluded examining
the association between LDL-C reduction and the RR of spe-
cific cardiovascular events. However, the effects of statins
on the different elements of this composite end point have
been shown to be largely consistent.6 Sixth, hazard ratios
were not available in all trials and risk ratios were used
when they were not.
Conclusions
In this meta-regression analysis, the use of statin and nonsta-
tin therapies that act via upregulation of LDL receptor expres-
sion to reduce LDL-C were associated with similar RRs of ma-
jorvasculareventsperchangeinLDL-C.LowerachievedLDL-C
levels were associated with lower rates of major coronary
