ABSTRACT 
1 
 
2 
Low vitamin D status is associated with risk of colorectal cancer and has been implicated in 
3 
inflammatory bowel disease.  Irritable Bowel Syndrome (IBS) is a chronic, relapsing, 
4 
functional bowel disorder. A nascent literature suggests a role for vitamin D in IBS, but this 
5 
has not been collated or critiqued.  To date seven studies have been published: four 
6 
observational studies and three randomised controlled trials (RCTs). All observational studies 
7 
reported that a substantial proportion of the IBS population were vitamin D deficient. Two 
8 
intervention studies reported improvement in IBS symptom severity scores and Quality of Life 
9 
(QoL) with vitamin D supplementation. 
10 
There are limited data around the role of vitamin D in IBS.  
11 
The available evidence suggests that low vitamin D status is common among the IBS 
12 
population and merits assessment and rectification for general health reasons alone. An inverse 
13 
correlation between serum vitamin D and IBS symptom severity is suggested and vitamin D 
14 
interventions may benefit symptoms. However, the available RCTs do not provide strong, 
15 
generalizable evidence; larger and adequately powered interventions are needed to establish a 
16 
case for therapeutic application of vitamin D in IBS.

INTRODUCTION 
1 
The reported health benefits of vitamin D have recently extended from musculoskeletal health 
2 
to focus on the potential relationships  in systemic diseases, such as Multiple Sclerosis (MS), 
3 
colorectal cancer (CRC), Inflammatory Bowel Disease (IBD) (1).  Vitamin D is a hormone that 
4 
has two key roles within the body; i) to aid the absorption of calcium and phosphate ii) control 
5 
the secretion of parathyroid hormone (2).  The principal circulating form of vitamin D is 25-
6 
hydroxyvitamin D (25(OH)D; calcifediol; ChEBI:17933), which is used clinically  to 
7 
determine vitamin D status (3).  There is no universally agreed optimal level of vitamin D, 
8 
however the National Academy of Medicine (USA and Canada) has asserted that serum 
9 
25(OH)D levels need to exceed 50nmol/L (20ng/ml) to be adequate to meet the needs of 97.5% 
10 
of the population (4) and by extension levels <50nmol/L (<20ng/mL) are considered 
11 
insufficient (5, 6).  Poor vitamin D status is of major public health concern with low vitamin D 
12 
status affecting 8-24% of children and 20% adults in the UK (7).  Consequently SACN 
13 
guidelines recommend an intake of 10 µg/d for anyone aged 1 year and older (8). Vitamin D 
14 
has increasingly been implicated in the pathobiology of colorectal diseases. A meta-analysis 
15 
and systematic review of observational studies in inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) suggested 
16 
that patients were 64% more likely to be vitamin D deficient compared to controls without IBD 
17 
(p=0.0001) (9).  Similarly, a recent review and a meta-analysis  of the potential relationship 
18 
between vitamin D and colorectal cancer identified an association between vitamin D intake 
19 
and colorectal cancer prevalence: a significant inverse association between dietary vitamin D 
20 
intake, 25(OH)D status and colorectal cancer risk was reported (10) (11).   The potential for 
21 
vitamin D as a secondary preventive of adenoma recurrence has also been investigated in 
22 
several trials both alone and in combination with calcium (12) 
23 
Irritable bowel syndrome is one of the most common functional bowel disorders seen globally 
24 
(10-20% of some populations (13) with significant healthcare cost  (14). The pathogenesis of 
25 
the disease remains unclear and is categorised primarily by the symptoms experienced ``z(15-
26 
17).  Symptoms of IBS include bloating, abdominal pain, diarrhoea and / or constipation; the 
27 
ROME III criteria incorporate assessment of these symptoms  to diagnose the condition (18).  
28 
There are three recognised sub-types of IBS: diarrhoea-predominant (Type D), constipation-
29 
predominant (Type C) and alternating diarrhoea and constipation (Type A) (19).   Other 
30 
common features of this syndrome not covered in the diagnostic criteria are bloating, passing 
31 
of mucus from the rectum, irregular stool habits and urgency of evacuation (20).  These 
32 
symptoms have a serious impact on the person’s every day quality of life and appear to have 
33 
 4 | P a g e  
 
strong links to mental health issues such as anxiety and depression (21). A number of reports 
1 
linking vitamin D and IBS have received significant media attention, this review aims to collate 
2 
and contextualize this research. The literature was searched systematically (See Supplementary 
3 
Online Information Section I) to identify the full scope of publications in this area; 7 reports 
4 
were identified, comprising of 4 observational studies and 3 randomised control trials (RCTs).

SUMMARY OF THE LITERATURE TO DATE 
1 
Observational Studies 
2 
Four intervention trials were identified that assessed vitamin D status in IBS (see Table 1).   
3 
A case study reported that a high dose supplementation (50-75mcg per day throughout the year) 
4 
of vitamin D  significantly improved one woman’s IBS symptoms (22), including a return to 
5 
almost-normal bowel patterns and decreased anxiety and depression.  This paper also 
6 
systematically identified analysed social media (blogs by people with IBS), noting that 70% of 
7 
37 individuals’ blogs reported that vitamin D supplementation resulted in an improvement of 
8 
symptoms. This case resided in the UK (hence a Northerly latitude), however blogs were from 
9 
those living internationally and exact locations were not reported.  Deficiency thresholds were 
10 
not defined and serum 25(OH)D levels were not stated.   Although in agreement with some 
11 
intervention trials (23, 24), case studies are not generalisable or statistically significant. 
12 
A case control study reported vitamin D serum concentrations in patients with IBS attending a 
13 
gastroenterology clinic in Saudi Arabia (International Medical Centre)(5). Cases had a 
14 
confirmed diagnosis of IBS using ROME III criteria and healthy controls were gender and age 
15 
matched staff members from the medical centre.  This study defined deficient serum 25(OH)D 
16 
concentrations as <50nmol/L (23, 25); mean serum 25(OH)D concentrations in patients with 
17 
IBS was 21�12nmol/L which was significantly different to 31�16nmol/L reported for the  
18 
control group. It should be noted that this study only reported serum 25(OH)D concentrations 
19 
retrospectively from medical records. 
20 
A second observational study in Saudi Arabia reported recruitment of subjects (n=498) with 
21 
both Crohn’s Disease (CD) and IBS and compared these to  a control group of staff and students 
22 
(n=442) (26). The study reported  insufficiency of serum 25(OH)D concentrations in 67.3% of 
23 
the patients,  however it is difficult to ascertain whether the insufficiency of vitamin D was a 
24 
result of the IBS, CD, a combination of both  or a common issue among this general population.  
25 
This study neglected to define their threshold of ‘vitamin D insufficiency’.   
26 
Both studies were conducted in Saudi Arabia known for its year-round sunshine which should 
27 
have a positive effect on serum 25(OH)D levels.  However, for religious reasons the population 
28 
avoid direct exposure of their skin to sunlight and a recent systematic review (27) of 13 studies 
29 
(n=24,399) found that 81% of different Saudi Arabian populations (e.g. pregnant/lactating 
30 
women, children, adults) had serum concentration levels of 25(OH)D <20ng/ml (<50nmol/L).  
31 
In a US-based study (Atlanta, Georgia) medical records of 1,000 IBS patients were reviewed 
32 
(28).  The mean serum concentration of 25(OH)D of the population studied was 25.05nmol/L. 
33 
It was also reported that 72% of women and 3% of men with IBS had a serum concentration 
34 
 6 | P a g e  
 
<30 nmol/L. There were no controls used for comparison.  Furthermore, this research is only 
1 
available in abstract form and as such a full analysis is unavailable. 
2 
A retrospective case-controlled study (6)  analysed the medical records of 55 children and 
3 
adolescents aged 6-21 diagnosed with IBS living in  Massachusetts, USA.  This research shows 
4 
that only 7% of the IBS cohort had sufficient vitamin D levels compared to 25% of BMI-
5 
matched healthy controls attending a well-child clinic.  This study suggested prevalent vitamin 
6 
D insufficiency in both the IBS and control populations, albeit with a limited study design. 
7 
 
8 
Intervention studies 
9 
Three intervention trials were identified that investigated the possible beneficial effect of 
10 
vitamin D on IBS symptoms (see Table 2).   
11 
Tazzyman et al. (2015) conducted a 12 week randomised double-blind three-arm parallel pilot 
12 
study in people with IBS which compared placebo to either vitamin D supplementation 
13 
(75µg/d) or combination of vitamin D (75µg/d) plus probiotic (two strains of Lactobacillus 
14 
acidophilus per capsule).  The trial was conducted in the UK in January-April 2015.  Analysis 
15 
of baseline data illustrated that participants with low vitamin D ( <50nmol/L) had lower QoL 
16 
(using the single question in the Total Symptom Severity IBS questionnaire (29) compared to 
17 
their replete counterparts (p=0.034)).  Improvements were reported in all treatment arms, but 
18 
no significant difference between the treatment arms was observed.  The study provides 
19 
valuable data on which to base power calculations for future randomised control trials.  
20 
A RCT conducted in Iran with 85 participants with IBS (23) found significant improvement of 
21 
IBS symptoms (p < 0.001) and quality of life (p <0.001) following very high dose (1250 µg 
22 
fortnightly for 6 months) vitamin D3 supplementation compared to a placebo over a period of 
23 
6 months.  Separate tools measured symptom severity (29) and quality of life (30) at baseline 
24 
and exit of the study.   
25 
A second Iranian study (24) used a 2x2 factorial design to conduct a blinded randomised control 
26 
trial with women aged 18-75 to investigate the effects of vitamin D, soy isoflavones or both on 
27 
IBS symptoms and quality of life.  One hundred participants were randomly assigned to one of 
28 
four possible arms of the intervention; vitamin D and placebo (D+P), soy isoflavones and 
29 
placebo (S+P), soy isoflavones and vitamin D (S+D) or both placebo vitamin D and placebo 
30 
soy isoflavones (P+P).  50 000 IU (1250 µg) of vitamin D was administered fortnightly and 2 
31 
x 20mg of soy isoflavones capsules daily.   The length of study was a restrictive 6 weeks with 
32 
a follow-up at 4 weeks post intervention. This study reported significant improvements in IBS 
33 
symptom severity score and quality of life in participants randomised to either vitamin D 
34 
 7 | P a g e  
 
isoflavones.  Both S+P and the D+P groups significantly improved IBS total score (p=0.004, 
1 
p=0.015 respectively).  The combination effect of vitamin D and soy on IBS-TS was also 
2 
significant (p<0.05).   
3 
Both the Abbasnezhad and Jalili studies showed extraordinarily low standard deviations of IBS 
4 
symptom severity scores (around 10% around the mean; our ongoing work suggests that the 
5 
majority of such studies report the SD of symptom severity in the range of 20-70% of the mean 
6 
(Corfe, unpublished). This suggests a significantly more homogenous population than 
7 
comparable publications, the reasons for this are unclear. 
8 
All three intervention studies reported low mean baseline vitamin D serum concentrations in 
9 
the IBS populations studied,, ranging from 14ng/mL-21.23ng/mL (35nmol/L-53nmol/L).  
10 
Vitamin D deficiency is present in the general populations of both the UK and Iran (31, 32) 
11 
populations and as such, no causal link with IBS can be inferred without control population 
12 
data.  Two (23, 25) out of the three studies showed an increase in the mean 25(OH)D levels 
13 
from deficient (<20ng/mL or <50nmol/L) status to replete (>20ng/mL or >50nmol/L) in the 
14 
active arm.   Dosages of vitamin D supplement varied between the studies.   The preparations 
15 
were either in the form of one 50 000IU (1250ug) oral capsule fortnightly or a daily 3000IU 
16 
(75ug) sublingual spray.  Although optimal dosing strategy is not known, research suggests 
17 
that both larger, less frequent doses and daily preparations are equal in effectiveness in their 
18 
repletion of 25 (OH)D (33, 34).  Despite small losses to follow up, final sample sizes from 
19 
previous studies appear to be relatively similar.

CONCLUSIONS AND DIRECTIONS 
1 
There is a nascent body of literature associating vitamin D status and the pathobiology and 
2 
management of colorectal conditions including IBD and cancer. Four papers and one abstract 
3 
report cross-sectional studies. A consistent limitation of these was that vitamin D status of the 
4 
wider population is not reported. Cause and effect are difficult to determine as it might be 
5 
argued that individuals with severe IBS may exhibit behaviour changes, for example elevated 
6 
time indoors consequent to symptoms, that may impact on vitamin D status.  
7 
Two of three interventions studies report a positive benefit of vitamin D supplementation in 
8 
people with IBS, however the low variation in the study populations and unusual dosing regime 
9 
in these two studies raises questions about the generalisability of the data.. All three RCTs 
10 
reported a relationship, either at baseline or in response to intervention, between vitamin D and 
11 
QoL, a symptom domain of particular importance to the patient population. 
12 
Collectively the studies reviewed, although restricted, offer enough justification for further 
13 
work in this subject area. In particular, future research may benefit from adequate powering 
14 
(Tazzyman et al. suggests 74 subjects / arm), now that effect size data are in the public domain, 
15 
to assure generalisability and conclusiveness. Future studies should include a broader spread 
16 
of participant, or multiple studies should address the potential benefits in defined populations 
17 
and limit claims to these populations.  
18 
Less equivocally, the body of evidence accrued across multiple populations already suggests 
19 
that vitamin D status assessment should be incorporated as a routine assessment alongside IBS 
20 
diagnosis in routine practice to identify individuals at risk and likely to benefit from vitamin D 
21 
intervention for general health as much as for IBS symptoms.
