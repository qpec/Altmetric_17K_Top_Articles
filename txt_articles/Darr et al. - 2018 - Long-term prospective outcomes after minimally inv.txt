Background: Minimally invasive sacroiliac joint fusion (SIJF) has become an increasingly 
accepted surgical option for chronic sacroiliac (SI) joint dysfunction, a prevalent cause of 
unremitting low back/buttock pain.
Objective: The objective of this study was to report clinical and functional outcomes of SIJF 
using triangular titanium implants (TTI) in the treatment of chronic SI joint dysfunction due to 
degenerative sacroiliitis or sacroiliac joint (SIJ) disruption at 3 years postoperatively.
Methods: A total of 103 subjects with SIJ dysfunction at 12 centers were treated with TTI in 
two prospective clinical trials (NCT01640353 and NCT01681004) and enrolled in this long-
term follow-up study (NCT02270203). Subjects were evaluated in study clinics at study start 
and again at 3, 4, and 5 years.
Results: Mean (SD) preoperative SIJ pain score was 81.5, and mean preoperative Oswestry Dis-
ability Index (ODI) was 56.3. At 3 years, mean pain SIJ pain score decreased to 26.2 (a 55-point 
improvement from baseline, p<0.0001). At 3 years, mean ODI was 28.2 (a 28-point improve-
ment from baseline, p<0.0001). In all, 82% of subjects were very satisfied with the procedure 
at 3 years. EuroQol-5D (EQ-5D) time trade-off index improved by 0.30 points (p<0.0001). No 
adverse events definitely related to the study device or procedure were reported; one subject 
underwent revision surgery at year 3.7. SIJ pain contralateral to the originally treated side 
occurred in 15 subjects of whom four underwent contralateral SIJF. The proportion of subjects 
who were employed outside the home full- or part-time at 3 years decreased somewhat from 
baseline (p=0.1814), and the proportion of subjects who would have the procedure again was 
lower at 3 years compared to earlier time points.
Conclusion: In long-term (3-year) follow-up, minimally invasive trans-iliac SIJF with TTI was 
associated with improved pain, disability, and quality of life with relatively high satisfaction rates.
Level of evidence: Level II.
Clinical relevance: SIJF with TTI.
Keywords: sacroiliac joint fusion, chronic low back pain, multicenter study
Introduction
Non-autoimmune sacroiliac joint (SIJ) dysfunction is increasingly recognized as an 
important cause of chronic low back pain, with prevalence estimates of 15–30%1–5 and 
a known female predominance.6,7 SIJ pain reduces quality of life to an extent similar to 
other spine conditions.8,9 Nonsurgical treatments include physical therapy, chiropractic, 
intra-articular SIJ steroid injections, prolotherapy, and radiofrequency neurotomy of 
sacral nerve root branches. These treatments have some literature support,10–15 but 
high-quality evidence supporting long-term improvements is lacking.

Darr et al
Minimally invasive sacroiliac joint fusion (SIJF) is an 
increasingly accepted surgical option for SIJ dysfunction. 
To date, improvement in pain, disability, and quality of life 
has been demonstrated in three prospective clinical trials16–18 
as well as numerous case series19–24 and comparative case 
series.25–27
Although multiple devices are now available for SIJF, the 
majority of reported literature describes the use of porous 
triangular titanium implants (TTI). Long-term studies report-
ing SIJF with TTI include a 3-year multicenter retrospective 
cohort,28 a 5-year single-center case series,29 and a 6-year 
comparative case series.30 The 6-year cohort included long-
term follow-up in patients who were unable to undergo SIJF 
due to insurance coverage denials; this cohort showed wors-
ened pain and disability scores, with worse working status 
and increased opioid use.
Long-term follow-up of patients enrolled in prospective 
clinical trials is a valuable but often challenging task. Herein, 
we report a prospective 3-year follow-up of subjects under-
going SIJF as part of two US prospective multicenter trials 
(Investigation of Sacroiliac Fusion Treatment [INSITE] and 
Sacroiliac Joint Fusion with iFuse Implant System [SIFI]). 
Follow-up is ongoing, and radiographic follow-up (with 5-year 
computed tomography [CT] scans) will be reported later.
Methods
Participants
Subjects included in this study (Long Term Outcomes from
INSITE and SIFI [LOIS], NCT02270203) were enrolled at 
12 centers who participated in either INSITE or SIFI. To 
participate, a site had to have enrolled and treated at least 
five patients with SIJF; have sufficient clinical trial resources, 
including a dedicated study investigator and coordinator who 
could carry out trial requirements; and the ability to maintain 
meaningful enrollment and follow-up for this long-term 
study. Of 39 sites participating in INSITE and SIFI, 12 sites 
met criteria of study participation. Participants were screened 
for study eligibility criteria and those not meeting all criteria 
(screen failures) or who refused participation were tabulated.
INSITE is a prospective multicenter randomized trial 
of SIJF vs. non-surgical management whose 2-year results 
showed high degrees of improvement in pain, disability, 
and quality of life in the surgical group but only modest 
responses in the non-surgical group.16 SIFI is a prospective 
multicenter single-arm clinical trial evaluating the same pro-
cedure/device; the follow-up schedule and assessments were 
nearly identical, and 2-year results were similarly positive.18 
A pooled analysis of these trials (along with a randomized 
trial from Europe17) showed marked homogeneity of study 
results.31
INSITE/SIFI subjects at participating centers were 
approached regarding participation in LOIS. To qualify, a 
subject had to have undergone SIJF with TTI within the 
INSITE or SIFI studies and sign a LOIS-specific informed 
consent form. As reported previously, enrollment in INSITE 
and SIFI required a diagnosis of SIJ dysfunction due to 
degenerative sacroiliitis or SIJ disruption that included 
elements of history, a positive Fortin finger test,32 at least 
three positive physical examination signs suggestive of SIJ 
dysfunction, and a positive diagnostic SIJ block performed 
under fluoroscopic or CT guidance. Key exclusion criteria 
were severe low back or hip pain due to other conditions, SIJ 
dysfunction due to autoimmune or inflammatory conditions 
and osteoporosis.16,18
Interventions and assessments
Study follow-up in LOIS consists of phone calls postopera-
tively at years 2.5, 3.5, and 4.5 as well as in-clinic study visits 
at years 3, 4, and 5. Phone calls were intended to maintain 
subject contact and assess for adverse events. At in-clinic 
visits, subjects completed surveys to assess SIJ pain and 
low back pain scores (identical visual analog scale [VAS; 
0–100 scale]), Oswestry Disability Index (ODI), quality of 
life (EuroQol-5D [EQ-5D] time trade-off [TTO] index, a 
health state utility value ranging from <0 [death] to 1 [perfect 
health]), and satisfaction. All questionnaires were adminis-
tered by trained study research coordinators.
Subjects were also queried regarding the occurrence 
of adverse events, defined using an international standard 
(ISO14155:2011). Both sites and study monitors also 
reviewed medical records to ensure complete adverse event 
reporting during follow-up study. For each event, the site 
investigator was required to assess severity and relatedness to 
their SIJF or preexisting condition. Relatedness to a device or 
procedure was characterized as definitely, probably, possibly, 
unlikely, or not related.
Herein, we report 3-year clinical, functional, and safety 
outcomes. The 5-year visit, which includes a high-resolution 
CT scan of the pelvis, will be reported elsewhere.
All centers obtained approval from applicable institutional 
review boards (IRB) (Table S1) for the extension study 
prior to participation. Subjects were recompensed nominal 
amounts for time and expense to complete study visit and 
call requirements, as approved by each site’s governing IRB. 
The study was sponsored by the device manufacturer (SI-
BONE, Inc., San Jose, CA, USA). All study sites underwent

Three-year outcomes of SI joint fusion
remote and regularly scheduled on-site data monitoring visits 
by sponsor representatives; all collected data were verified 
against source documents at the site.
The primary efficacy success end point for this study is 
a composite success end point at 3, 4, and 5 years defined as 
a reduction from preoperative VAS SIJ pain score of at least 
20 points, absence of device-related serious adverse events, 
absence of neurological worsening, and absence of surgical 
revision. Note that the primary end point used was identical 
to that used in the component trials (INSITE and SIFI), where 
the primary clinical end points were evaluated at 6 months. 
Other outcomes included improvements in V
AS SIJ pain score, 
ODI,33 EQ-5D score,34 proportion of non-working subjects 
who return to work, and occurrence of serious adverse events.
Statistical analysis
A standard approach to statistical analysis was used to calcu-
late standard aspects of change scores and binary outcomes. 
Repeated measures analysis of variance, which simultane-
ously takes into account multiple measurements per subject, 
was used to determine statistical significance of changes from 
baseline, where relevant binary outcomes were measured 
with a chi-squared test, McNemar’s test, or exact binomial 
confidence intervals.
Results
Of 127 potentially eligible INSITE/SIFI subjects, 103 were 
enrolled in LOIS. Reasons for non-participation included 
inability to participate due to health issues (n=2), death 
prior to screening (n=3), lost to follow-up on previous study 
(n=4), moved out of state (n=1), refused study participation 
(n=11), planning pregnancy (n=1), previous withdrawal 
from INSITE or SIFI (n=1), and unlikely to be compliant 
(n=1). Of the 103 participating subjects, 96 (93%) subjects 
had 3-year follow-up visits. Reasons for lack of follow-up 
included loss to follow-up (n=5), death due to other causes 
(n=2), and withdrawal of consent (n=1).
All enrolled subjects met study eligibility criteria. There 
were no meaningful differences in baseline demographic 
characteristics for subjects enrolled in LOIS vs. those 
enrolled in the original trials (Table 1). Two-year responses 
to SIJF were slightly larger in subjects participating at LOIS 
sites compared to those who did not participate (improvement 
in VAS SIJ pain of 62.3 vs. 48.0 points, p<0.0001; improve-
ment in ODI of 28.8 vs. 23.9 points, p=0.0776). There were no 
meaningful differences in the cohort enrolled versus subjects 
completing the 3-year visit (not shown). Subjects (mean age 
51 years) were mostly Caucasians (97%) and female (73%). 
Subjects had high preoperative pain scores (mean [SD] of

81.5 [12.6]) and high levels of disability (ODI score 56.3 
[12.1]). The duration of pain prior to enrollment averaged 
5.7 years. EQ-5D at baseline was 0.45 (0.17), indicating a 
very poor quality of life.8 In all, 77% of subjects were tak-
ing opioids for back or SIJ pain preoperatively and 45% had 
a history of lumbar fusion, and concomitant spine and hip 
disease was common. Most (93, 90.3%) patients underwent 
unilateral SIJF on either of the treatment studies; 10 (9.7%) 
patients had qualifying pain, physical examination signs, and 
diagnostic blocks consistent with bilateral SIJ dysfunction 
and therefore underwent bilateral SIJF. Pain but not ODI 
scores between months 6 and 24 was slightly lower at sites 
that participated in the current study vs. those that did not 
(not shown).
At 3 years, the mean SIJ pain score had decreased to 26.2, 
representing a mean change from preoperative score of 55 
points (p<0.0001; Figure 1). In all, 71 (86%) subjects met 
the primary efficacy success composite end point. The mean 
ODI score decreased from 56 preoperatively to 28 at 3 years, 
an improvement of 28 points (p<0.0001). In all, 60 (72.3%) 
subjects had improvement in ODI scores of at least 15 points 
from their preoperative score. Compared to subjects who did 
not participate in this long-term follow-up study, participants 
in the current study had slightly larger 24-month improve-
ments in SIJ pain and ODI (62.3 vs. 48.0 points, p<0.0001; 
improvement in ODI of 28.8 vs. 23.9 points, p=0.0776). Had 
all subjects in INSITE/SIFI participated, estimated responses 
over all follow-up would have been slightly smaller (by 8 
or fewer points for VAS SIJ pain [0–100 scale] and 3.2 or 
fewer points for ODI). EQ-5D TTO index improved by 0.30 
points (p<0.0001).
Satisfaction rates with the iFuse result were high (96% 
subjects were very or somewhat satisfied at 3 years; Figure 2). 
The proportion of patients who would definitely undergo the 
procedure again was high at 24 months (87%) and lower at 
month 36 (73%, p=0.003 for change from month 24 to month 
36). Satisfaction rates correlated with improvement in SIJ 
pain and ODI. Work status (i.e., the proportion of subjects 
working full- or part-time outside the home) at 36-month 
follow-up was unchanged compared to baseline (McNemar 
p=0.1814; Figure 3).
To date, 168 adverse events were reported in 75 subjects, 
most of which were unrelated to the pelvis or spine. Of the 
22 events involving the pelvis, one involved bilateral SIJ 
pain, five reported ipsilateral SIJ pain, one was potentially 
related to the index SIJ and 15 reported SIJ pain contralat-
eral to the index side. One subject, who experienced only 
modest temporary SIJ pain relief, underwent revision of the 
index side at year 3.7 at the subject’s request by a non-study 
physician. Imaging showed excellent device placement and 
no radiolucency; the investigator believed that progressive 
lumbar scoliosis contributed to the subject’s pain. Five 
subjects underwent treatment of contralateral SIJ pain with 
SIJF. No subject had an event rated as related to the iFuse 
implant or placement procedure. One subject had worsening 
lumbar facet pain rated as probably related to a non-surgical 
SIJ procedure. There were no severe device- or procedure-
related adverse events.
Discussion
SIJ dysfunction markedly impacts quality of life8 and is 
potentially treatable with both non-surgical and surgical 
approaches. However, the condition is often overlooked 
as an etiology of axial back pain, primarily because, until 
recently, no surgical treatment had been shown to provide 
adequate long-term pain relief with an acceptable recovery 
profile. With the advent of minimally invasive SIJF, famil-
iarity and interest in the condition have grown and specialty 
society guidelines are now available.35,36 Published literature 
confirming the safety and effectiveness of SIJF is expanding 
and now includes two prospective multicenter randomized 
trials,16,17 a prospective multicenter single-arm trial18 and 
multiple case series.19–30
Herein, we report 3-year follow-up of subjects who 
participated in two 24-month prospective multicenter US 
trials (one randomized trial16 and one prospective single-arm 
trial18). We observed ongoing improvements in SIJ pain, dis-
ability, and quality of life, which appear to be durable over 
time. These improvements were relatively large and similar 
to those observed in other commonly performed spine sur-
gery procedures. Satisfaction rates were high, and very few 
patients had SIJ-related complaints that required surgical 
treatment. The proportion of subjects who stated they would 
definitely have the procedure again was significantly less at 
month 36 compared to month 24; the reason for this is not 
known. SIJF did not affect work status overall.
In all, 15% of subjects reported SIJ pain contralateral to 
the index side during the study. Our study cannot determine 
which of the following could pertain: 1) the same degenera-
tive process that affected the index side affected the contra-
lateral side; 2) the subject had bilateral pain at baseline with 
only one (the index) side qualifying for surgery within the 
study; 3) increased activity as a result of successful index 
side surgery may exacerbate the contralateral SIJ; or 4) fusion 
of the index side biomechanically accelerates degeneration 
of the contralateral side, a variant on adjacent segment

degeneration. A biomechanical study showed that SIJF does 
not significantly alter the loading across the contralateral SIJ, 
suggesting no increase in the likelihood of adjacent segment 
degeneration.37 Our data provide little evidence that SIJF 
increases the risk of hip or lumbar spine pathology. One 
subject underwent revision surgery of the index side at his 
request by a non-study physician.
Our results are similar to those observed in several 
other retrospective case series,28–30 which have reported

Darr et al
cohort, sustained positive outcomes and relatively low ODI 
scores were reported.28 A small cohort of patients at 5 years 
showed low pain scores and high rates of bony fusion.29 In 
a comparative cohort study conducted in Spain, patients 
who underwent SIJF demonstrated improvements in pain, 
disability, work status, and opioid use in comparison with 
patients undergoing continued conservative management 
who experienced worsened pain, disability, and work status 
as well as increased opioid use.30
Although the diagnosis of SIJ-mediated back/buttocks 
pain is often described as being challenging, our results sug-
gest that SIJ dysfunction can not only be reliably diagnosed 
(through a combination of history, physical examination, 
and response to diagnostic SIJ block[s]) but also effectively 
treated.
The major advantage of this study is the prospective 
long-term follow-up of a relatively large number of subjects 
from a variety of treatment settings undergoing SIJF in 
two prospective clinical trials. The primary disadvantage 
is the lack of long-term data from a concurrent control 
group receiving only non-surgical treatment. In the INSITE 
study, most subjects in the non-surgical control group who 
experienced inadequate pain relief at month 6 crossed over 
to surgical care. However, long-term non-surgical follow-
up appears to be associated with very poor outcomes.30 
Another limitation is that several sites in INSITE and SIFI 
could not participate in the current study due to either 
low numbers of subjects or lack of clinical trial resources; 
subjects at participating sites had slightly larger 24-month 
improvements in SIJ pain and ODI compared to those at 
non-participating sites. The calculated impact on 3-year 
scores reported herein was small – approximately 4 points 
for VAS SIJ pain and 2.4 points for ODI. Another limita-
tion is that the data from this study of triangular implants 
are not applicable to clinical outcomes from devices with 
other designs and fusion strategies for SIJF.
