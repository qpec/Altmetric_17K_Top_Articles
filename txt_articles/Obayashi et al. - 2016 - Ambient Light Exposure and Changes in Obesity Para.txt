Context: Previous epidemiological studies have suggested an association between nighttime light
levels and the prevalence of obesity, although evidence is limited to cross-sectional studies.
Objective: To evaluate the longitudinal association between ambient light exposure and the sub-
sequent changes in obesity parameters.
Design and Participants: Data from 1110 elderly participants at baseline (mean age, 71.9 years) and
data from 766 at follow-up (median, 21 months) were included in this prospective population-
based study.
Measures: Time-dependent ambient light exposure based on objective measurements and
changes in the waist-to-height ratio (WHtR) and body mass index (BMI) were measured.
Results: Multivariable mixed-effect linear regression models showed a significant association be-
tween light exposure and the %WHtR gain; this was independent of potential confounders (eg,
caloric intake, physical activity, and sleep/wake parameters). Nighttime or evening exposure to
higher light intensity was significantly associated with subsequent %WHtR gain. Morning expo-
sure to a longer time �500 lux or nighttime exposure to a longer time �3 lux was significantly
associated with subsequent %WHtR loss. These association trends were nearly consistent when the
BMI was used as an obesity parameter. Increased nighttime light exposure (mean �3 vs �3 lux) was
estimated to correspond to a 10.2% WHtR gain and a 10.0% increase in BMI over 10 years.
Conclusions: Ambient light exposure, such as increased nighttime or evening light exposure and
decreased morning light exposure, was independently associated with subsequent increases in
obesity parameters. Further interventional studies are warranted to establish an optimal con-
trolled lighting environment as a preventive option against obesity. (J Clin Endocrinol Metab 101:

T
he prevalence of obesity has increased over time in
most countries and has now reached epidemic pro-
portions (1–4). Obesity is widely recognized as one of
the leading health threats worldwide and a major risk
factor for hypertension, diabetes, cardiovascular diseases,
cancer, and early mortality (5–9). Although obesity is pri-
marily caused by overeating and physical inactivity, existing
diet and physical exercise programs have failed to
prevent this epidemic (10), warranting novel innovative
approaches.
Energy homeostasis is fundamentally maintained by
the endogenous circadian timing system under the control
of the suprachiasmatic nucleus of the hypothalamus (the
master biological clock) (11). Clock gene mutations in-
duced obesity in mice (12), and circadian misalignment
between the internal and environmental rhythms de-

 creased daily energy expenditure and leptin levels in hu-
man experimental studies (13, 14) These findings agree
with previous epidemiological findings of obesity being
induced by shiftwork, which is associated with chronic
circadian misalignment (15).
The solar 24-hour cycle has led to the evolution of the
human circadian timing system, which is crucially influ-
enced by light information. Light exposure at an inappro-
priate timing against the solar cycle can desynchronize the
internal rhythms from the environmental rhythms, result-
ing in circadian misalignment (16). Modern societies have
developed with the widespread use of electrical lighting at
night (17). Recent experimental studies using mice (18,
19) demonstrated that an 8-week exposure to nighttime
light significantly increased body mass, even at a low in-
tensity (5 lux), and 5-week exposure to a shorter nighttime
dark period dose-dependently increased fat mass. In epi-
demiological studies (20, 21), a higher prevalence of obe-
sity was observed in individuals with a higher nighttime
bedroom light intensity measured objectively and subjec-
tively; however, evidence is limited to cross-sectional stud-
ies (22). The purpose of this study is to evaluate the hy-
pothesis about whether objectively measured ambient
light exposure is longitudinally associated with the sub-
sequent changes in obesity parameters.
Subjects and Methods
Study participants and design
Baseline data of the HEIJO-KYO cohort was collected be-
tween September and April, 2010–2014, and included 1127
community-dwelling elderly individuals aged �60 years. Of
these, we excluded participants who did not complete measure-
ments of light exposure and obesity parameters. As a result, we
evaluated the primary outcomes from 1110 participants at base-
line and from 766 at follow-up (median duration, 21 months).
Follow-up was conducted between August and September. All
participants provided written informed consent. The study pro-
tocol was approved by the Nara Medical University ethics
committee.
The baseline study protocol was reported in our previous
study (23). In brief, the homes of participants were visited pre-
dominantly on weekdays and demographic and medical infor-
mation was collected during face-to-face interviews by trained
interviewers using a standardized questionnaire. Waist circum-
ference, body weights, and heights were measured and venous
blood samples were collected. Then, light exposure measure-
ments were performed for 48-hour from noon of the first day to
noon of the third day and participants were instructed to main-
tain a standardized sleep diary for the first and second night.
Overnight urine for the second night was collected. Finally, the
instruments, sleep diaries, and urine samples were collected from
the homes of the participants. All participants did not receive any
instruction on their eating, activity or sleep behavior, except for
drinking. They were instructed not to consume alcohol during
the designated monitoring period.
Measurements of light exposure
Morning (4 hours after rising time), evening (4 hours be-
fore bedtime), daytime (rising time to bedtime), and nighttime
(bedtime to rising time) were defined using data from the sleep
diary.
Light exposures in the morning, evening, and daytime, were
measured for two consecutive days at 1-minute intervals using a
wrist light meter (Actiwatch 2; Respironics Inc) worn on the
nondominant wrist. The device has a photodiode with a spectral
sensitivity approximating that of the human eye (illuminance
sensitivity, 0–150 000 lux). All participants were given special
rubber bands to prevent their shirtsleeves from covering the de-
vice. Daytime values of �1 lux were considered artifact data
because of the sensor coverage and were not considered for cal-
culating mean values (24). If light data for more than half of the
daytime period were interpreted as artifacts, the data were con-
sidered missing. Mean light intensities were used as parameters
of exposed light amplitude. Times above the threshold intensities
werethetotalminutesabovethethresholds,whichwerebasedon
the values of 500 and 1000 lux during daytime used in the pre-
vious observational studies (23–25). The thresholds of 50 and
100 lux on evening light exposure were based on our previous
datashowingthatmedianintensityofeveninglightexposurewas
approximately 1/10 of that of daytime (26). Data were analyzed
after base 10 logarithmic transformation.
Light exposures during the nighttime and in the first (1 hour
after bedtime) and last hour of the night (1 hour before rising
time) were measured for two consecutive nights at 1-minute in-
tervals using a portable light meter (LX-28SD; Sato Shouji Inc)
placed facing the ceiling by the head of the subject’s bed at 60 cm
above the floor (illuminance sensitivity, 0–100 000 lux). Light
meter measurements were synchronized to those of the wrist
light meter. Mean light intensities were used as parameters of
exposedlightamplitude.Timesbelowthethresholdintensities(3
and 10 lux) were the total minutes below the thresholds. Since
normalizing the distribution of nighttime light was difficult, we
conducted categorical analysis by tertile value or the predefined
threshold(3and10lux)whichwerebasedonthevaluesthathave
minimal effects on human physiology (16).
Measurements of the obesity parameters
Waist circumference at the umbilicus level, height, and body
weight were measured in the standing position. The waist-to-
height ratio (WHtR) was calculated as the waist circumference
(in meters) divided by height (in meters), and the body mass
index (BMI) was calculated as body weight (in kilograms)
divided by height (in meters2). WHtR is more accurate than
BMI or waist circumference for evaluating fat distribution
and accumulation and for determining cardiometabolic risk
(27, 28). Abdominal obesity was defined as WHtR �0.6 be-
cause clinical significance increases beyond this value in the
elderly (29).
Measurements of the covariates
Current smoking, drinking, and socioeconomic statuses were
surveyed using a questionnaire. Caloric intake was assessed by a
validated food frequency questionnaire containing 29 food
groups and 10 kinds of cookery; the weekly intake of each food

 group was estimated by commonly used units or portion sizes
(30). Physical activity was assessed using the International Phys-
ical Activity Questionnaire (Japanese version) containing ques-
tions on the amount of time spent performing moderate and
vigorous activities and walking per week (31). A standardized
sleep diary was used to estimate bedtimes and rising times. Sub-
jective sleep quality was assessed using the Pittsburgh Sleep
Quality Index (PSQI) questionnaire, and sleep disturbances were
defined as a PSQI score �6 (32). As an index of melatonin se-
cretion, urinary 6-sulfatoxymelatonin excretion (UME) was
measured from urine samples collected overnight as described in
our previous publication (23). Day length (sunrise to sunset),
based on the measurement days in Nara, Japan (latitude 34°N),
was extracted from the website of the National Astronomical
Observatory of Japan (33).
Statistical analysis
Averages of the data for light exposure, sleep diary, and day
length on two measurement days were used for analysis. Means
were compared between the dichotomous groups using the un-
pairedttest,andthe�2testwasusedtocomparecategoricaldata.
The mean, median, or proportion was substituted for missing
data of independent variables. Data of total participants (n �
1110) were used in cross-sectional analysis of the association
between light exposure and abdominal obesity. In a longitudinal
analysis using data of 1110 participants at baseline and 766
participants at follow-up, the association between light exposure
and changes in the obesity parameters was evaluated by mixed-
effect linear regression analysis consisting of the individual-level
variables (light exposure, age [�70 vs �70 years], sex [male vs
female], follow-up duration [�2 vs �2 years], current smoking
status [yes vs no], alcohol consumption [�30 vs �30 g/d], house-
hold income [�4 vs �4 million Japanese yen per year], education
[�13 vs �13 years], caloric intake [per 100 kcal/d], physical
activity [per log metabolic equivalent hours per week], sleep dis-
turbances [yes vs no], bedtime [per 1 hour delay], duration in bed
[per1hour],UME[perlog�g],anddaylength[perquartile])and
the day-level variables (WHtR and BMI). Regression coefficients
were estimated by the maximum likelihood method. All analyses
were performed using SPSS, version 19.0 for Windows (IBM
SPSS Inc). Statistical significance was set at a two-sided P value
�.05. Time-dependent changes in exposed light intensity were
smoothed by the generalized additive model, minimizing the
generalized cross-validation score (34) using the R statistics
package (35).
Results
Baseline characteristics
The mean age of participants at baseline was 71.9 � 7.1
years (Table 1). The mean WHtR was 0.536 � 0.057.
WHtR correlated better with waist circumference than
height (r � 0.85 vs �0.31, respectively). The median of
mean light intensities in the morning, evening, daytime,
and nighttime were 345.9, 24.0, 337.2, and 0.7 lux, re-
spectively (Table 2). The median time �500 lux in the
morning, �100 lux in the evening, �500 lux during day-
time, and �3 lux during nighttime were 24, 6, 74, and 467
minutes. These baseline characteristics stratified by the
follow-up status are summarized in tables.

 Figure 1 shows time-dependent changes in exposed
light intensity between the groups with (n � 138) and
without (n � 972) abdominal obesity at baseline. The
abdominal obesity group was exposed to a lower light
intensity from rising time to near the beginning of the
evening than the group with no abdominal obesity. There-
after, the former was mostly exposed to higher light in-
tensity throughout the night.
Longitudinal association between light exposure
and obesity parameters
Themeanfollow-upWHtRwas0.550�0.059,andthe
mean WHtR difference (follow-up minus baseline) was
0.016 (95% confidence interval [CI], 0.014 to 0.019),
respectively.
Morning exposure to higher light intensity was signif-
icantly associated with subsequent %WHtR loss in the
unadjusted model over a median follow-up of 21 months
(P � .002; Table 3), but this was insignificant in the min-
imally adjusted model (P � .07; model 1). A longer time
�500 lux in the morning was significantly associated with
subsequent %WHtR loss in the unadjusted model; the
association remained significant in the fully adjusted
model (P � .022; model 2), whereas there was a marginal
association between a longer time �1000 lux in the morn-
ing and %WHtR loss (P � .06; model 2).
Regarding evening light, no parameter was signifi-
cantly associated with a change in %WHtR in the unad-
justed models. After adjusting for confounders, evening
exposure to higher light intensity and a longer time �100
lux were significantly associated with subsequent %WHtR
gain (P � .045 and P � .032, respectively; model 2).

 Daytime light, including morning and evening light,
was significantly associated with subsequent %WHtR
loss in the unadjusted models, and the only association
between a longer time �500 lux during the daytime and
subsequent %WHtR loss remained significant in the ad-
justed model (P � .021; model 2).
Nighttime exposure to higher light intensity (mean �3
lux) was significantly associated with subsequent %WHtR
gain in each statistical model (P � .010, model 2). A longer
time �3 lux during the nighttime was significantly asso-
ciated with subsequent %WHtR loss in each statistical
model (P � .021; model 2). These results were consistent
when a higher cutoff intensity of 10 lux was used. Re-
garding light intensity in the first hour of the nighttime
period, no significant association with %WHtR change
was observed in any statistical model; however, higher
light intensity in the last hour of the night (the highest vs
lowest tertiles) was significantly associated with subse-
quent %WHtR gain in each statistical model (P � .030;
model 2).
When using BMI as the obesity parameter, the associ-
ation trends between light exposure and change in BMI
were mostly consistent. In the fully adjusted models, BMI
gain was significantly associated with evening or night-
time exposure to higher light intensity and evening expo-
sure to a longer time above the thresholds. BMI loss was
significantly associated with daytime exposure to a longer
time �500 lux and nighttime exposure to a longer time
below the thresholds. Additionally, daytime exposure to a
longer time �500 lux and nighttime exposure to higher

Discussion
Wefoundindependentassociationsbetweenambientlight
exposure, such as increased nighttime or evening light ex-
posure and decreased morning or daytime light exposure,
and subsequent increases in obesity parameters. To our
knowledge, this is the first longitudinal study reporting a
significant association between time-dependent ambient
light levels and obesity risk in a large general population.
Nighttime exposure to higher light intensity was sig-
nificantly associated with WHtR and BMI gain; con-
versely, a longer dark exposure during the nighttime was
significantly associated with WHtR and BMI loss. Al-
though the nighttime light levels we observed were low,
our findings were consistent with previous experimental
studies. Fonken et al (18) showed that exposure to night-
time light for 8 weeks significantly increased the body
mass of mice, even at a low intensity (5 lux), independently
of caloric intake and physical activity. Kooijman et al (19)
suggested that exposure to a shorter nighttime dark period
for 5 weeks increased the fat mass of mice dose-depend-
ently through a decrease in energy expenditure by the in-
activation of brown adipose tissue. Additionally, mini-
mizing light exposure just before rising may be important
to prevent obesity. Although median light intensity and
variationweresimilarbetweenthefirstandlasthourofthe
night, the obesity parameter changes were more strongly
associated with light exposure during the last hour of the
night than the first hour of the night. According to the
phase-response curve to light (36), early morning light
advances the internal circadian phase, suggesting that
light exposure during the last part of the night may cause
circadian misalignment between the internal and environ-
mental rhythms.
In the evening, increased light exposure was signifi-
cantly associated with both WHtR and BMI gain, which
may have resulted from the circadian phase delay or the
shortened biological night. Although this association was
insignificant in the unadjusted models, after adjusting for
important confounders (ie, age and gender), this associa-
tion became significant. The phase-response curve indi-
cated that the magnitude of phase delay is greater in the
evening than in the other period (36). Moreover, previous
studies suggested that evening exposure to room light
�200 lux suppressed the onset of melatonin synthesis (37)
and prolonged sleep initiation (38), indicating that eve-
ning light shortened the melatonin-organized biological
night and sleep duration. In our present study, the asso-
ciations between light exposure and obesity parameters
were independent of the total amount of nighttime mela-
tonin secretion and subjective sleep quality.
Morning or daytime exposure to a longer time �500
lux significantly reduced the obesity parameters, which
was possibly associated with the circadian alignment and
enhanced sleep quality and melatonin levels. This moder-
ate light intensity measured using wrist light meters gen-
erally originates in sunlight and would contribute to syn-
chronization of the internal rhythms to the environmental
rhythms. A previous cross-sectional study suggested that
early daytime exposure to moderate light intensity �500
lux was significantly associated with lower BMI (26).
Midday bright light intervention of 2500 lux enhanced
nocturnal melatonin secretion and improved sleep quality
among elderly patients with insomnia (39). In our previ-
ous study (22), higher daytime ambient light exposure was
associated with greater nocturnal melatonin levels, which
relate to circadian alignment and may regulate energy ex-
penditure through growing and activating brown adipose
tissue (40, 41).
Cumulative effects of light exposure on the obesity risk
can be estimated from our results. Higher nighttime light

 intensity (�3 vs �3 lux) and increased evening light in-
tensity from the 25th to 75th percentiles (15.9–37.0 lux)
corresponded to 10.2 and 4.5% for WHtR gain and 10.0
and 9.1% for BMI gain, respectively, over 10 years. Con-
versely, increased daytime exposure to time �500 lux and
increasednighttimeexposuretotime�3luxfromthe25th
to 75th percentiles (40–129 and 420–516 minutes, re-
spectively) corresponded to 5.3 and 6.1% for WHtR loss,
and 6.7% and 7.1% for BMI loss, respectively, over 10
years. In our study, nighttime light intensity and daytime
light exposure had mutually independent effects on the
obesity parameters. Additionally, increased nighttime
light and decreased daytime light are common exposures
in modern society, suggesting high population attribut-
able risks. Thus, changing daily light exposure patterns
may be clinically significant for reducing the obesity risk.
Previous epidemiological studies have indicated that
short sleep duration increases the risk of obesity (42). In
fact, inadequate sleep decreases leptin levels and increases
ghrelin levels, resulting in increased appetite and obesity
risk (43); however, our main results were independent of
baseline caloric intake. Also, nighttime light is a potential
sleep disruptor even at low light intensity (44). Addition-
ally, previous population-based studies suggested that the
late chronotype was associated with obesity in adult and
children (45, 46) and showed the late chronotype was
exposed to a higher light intensity in evening and short
sleep duration (47, 48). Thus, light exposure may be the
potential upstream factor of this previous epidemiological
evidence. Longitudinal studies investigating the associa-
tions of light exposure with sleep duration and chrono-
types are needed.
This study has several limitations. First, participants
were not randomly selected, possibly leading to selection
bias. However, the parameters of BMI and the estimated
glomerular filtration rate were similar to the correspond-
ing national data for Japan (49). Second, the follow-up
data on obesity parameters were only available from 766
participants (69%), possibly affecting the validity of the
statistical results. As shown in Tables 1 and 2, participants
lost to follow-up were significantly older, had lower ed-
ucation levels, engaged in less physical activity, spent lon-
ger durations in bed, had lower UME levels, and were
exposed to higher nighttime light levels. These factors may
lead to an underestimation of the detected influence be-
cause of exposure to higher nighttime light intensity and
poor lifestyles leading to obesity. Third, the present cohort
only included elderly participants; therefore, the general-
izability of our findings to a younger population remains
undetermined. Age-related cloudiness of the crystalline
lens causes decreased light reception to the retina, even
before cataract diagnosis, and the capacity for light recep-
tion in a 70-year-old is one-fifth of that in a teenager (50),
possibly implying that light exposure has greater effects in
younger individuals. Studies on the younger population
are warranted. In addition, we had no information related
to the incidence of chronic diseases associated with a loss
of WHtR and BMI in our elderly population, so some
residual confounding effect of the chronic diseases may
exist. Fourth, light levels were measured over only 2 days
without eye-level light meters, possibly leading to misclas-
sification of the ambient light status. A previous study
reported significant correlations between illumination at
the cornea level and the wrist level (r � 0.76) (51). The
day-to-day reproducibility of light exposure parameters
was reported in our previous study where both daytime
and nighttime light intensities were moderately correlated
(r � 0.61–0.70) (22). The interseasonal reproducibility
was fair (r � 0.45–0.47) (39); however, the present sta-
tistical models were adjusted for day length. Furthermore,
future studies measuring wave lengths would reveal more
appropriate associations because shorter wave lengths
are mostly sensitive to alignment of circadian biological
rhythms (50).
In conclusion, ambient light exposure, such as in-
creased nighttime or evening light exposure and decreased
morning or daytime light exposure, was independently
associated with subsequent increases in obesity parame-
ters in a general elderly population. Returning to a natural
light exposure pattern may help prevent obesity. Further
interventional studies are warranted to establish an opti-
mal controlled lighting environment as a preventive op-
tion against obesity.
