Abstract
Diesel cars have been emitting four to seven times more NOx in on-road driving than in type approval
tests. These ‘excess emissions’ are a consequence of deliberate design of the vehicle’s after-treatment
system, as investigations during the ‘Dieselgate’ scandal have revealed. Here we calculate health and
environmental impacts of these excess NOx emissions in all European countries for the year 2013. We
use national emissions reported officially under the UNECE Convention for Long-range Transport of
Atmospheric Pollutants and employ the EMEP MSC-W Chemistry Transport Model and the GAINS
Integrated Assessment Model to determine atmospheric concentrations and resulting impacts. We
compare with impacts from hypothetical emissions where light duty diesel vehicles are assumed to
emit only as much as their respective type approval limit value or as little as petrol cars of the same age.
Excess NO2 concentrations can also have direct health impacts, but these overlap with the impacts
from particulate matter (PM) and are not included here. We estimate that almost 10 000 premature
deaths from PM2.5 and ozone in the adult population (age >30 years) can be attributed to the NOx
emissions from diesel cars and light commercial vehicles in EU28 plus Norway and Switzerland in
2013. About 50% of these could have been avoided if diesel limits had been achieved also in on-road
driving; and had diesel cars emitted as little NOx as petrol cars, 80% of these premature deaths could
have been avoided. Ecosystem eutrophication impacts (critical load exceedances) from the same
diesel vehicles would also have been reduced at similar rates as for the health effects.
1. Introduction
Since the late 1990s the sales share of LDDVs (light
duty diesel vehicles) has risen sharply at the expense
of petrol in most European countries (see the online
supplementary data available at stacks.iop.org/ERL/12/
094017/mmedia). This development has been inten-
tional, as diesel engines emit less CO2 than comparable
petrol engines. However, they emit significantly more
NOx (NO + NO2). Road transport contributes about
40% of the land based NOx emissions in the EU28+
countries (EU28 plus Norway and Switzerland), and is
one of the main reasons why several countries, includ-
ing Germany, France, Austria, Belgium, and Ireland,
consistently exceed their internationally agreed NOx
emission caps (Wankm¨
uller et al 2015). Exceedances
of Europe’s ambient NO2 air quality limit values have
to a large part been attributed to the emissions from
diesel cars (Kiesewetter et al 2014, Carslaw et al 2016,
Degraeuwe et al 2016).
Euro 3 and newer LDDVs should emit less NOx
than the older vehicles, both petrol and diesel, that they
are replacing. However, unlike petrol cars, on the road
these cars do not comply with Euro limit values. (Chen
and Borken-Kleefeld 2014, Fontaras et al 2014, Hag-
man et al 2015, Yang et al 2015). In fact, measurements
indicate that Euro 3, 4 and 5 LDDVs may have higher
emissions under actual driving conditions than older
diesel vehicles (Chen and Borken-Kleefeld 2014). Fur-
thermore Euro 5 LDDVs may have higher emissions

than previous Euro class vehicles under actual driving
conditions (Ligterink et al 2013).
The difference between expected and actual emis-
sions of NOx has gained a lot of attention following
the discovery of Volkswagen’s (VW) diesel ‘defeat
devices’ (US-EPA 2015, BMVI 2016, UK Department
for Transport 2016), where software is installed in
the vehicles which reduces NOx emissions to com-
ply with emissions tests in the US and Europe. In
Europe about 8.5 million VW diesel cars have been
sold with defeat devices installed, a far greater number
than in the US where the defeat device was first dis-
covered. As a result, the effects on health in Europe
should be much larger than that calculated for the US
(Hou et al 2016). Chossi`
ere et al (2017) have calcu-
latedtheeffectsofexcessNOx emissionsfromVW-only
diesel passenger vehicles in Germany, and found that
these vehicles have resulted in about 1200 premature
deaths integrated over the sales period 2008–2015 in
Germany and neighbouring countries. However, large
discrepancies between test cycle NOx emissions and
on-roademissionshavebeenfoundacrossallmanufac-
turers (UK Department for Transport 2016, Transport
and Environment 2016). Therefore, in this study, we
analysetheconsequencesofexcessNOx emissionsfrom
the whole fleet of LDDVs (and not just a single brand)
across all of Europe.
Here we calculate concentrations and depositions
of air pollutants in Europe with emissions and mete-
orology from 2013 focusing on the effects of excess
NOx emissionsfromLDDVs.NOx emissionsfromtraf-
fic assumed to reflect real driving conditions are used
as a reference case. Additional model calculations are
made assuming emissions from LDDVs are compliant
with the EU and national regulations and assuming all
LDDVs emit as petrol vehicles. Finally we also include
a model calculation without LDDVs. Based on these
scenarios,theeffectsontheconcentrationsoftheatmo-
spheric pollutants NO2, PM2.5 and ozone, as well as the
deposition of nitrogen, are estimated.
The relationship between NO2 and health is sci-
entifically not as well founded as for PM2.5 and ozone
(WMO 2013). In this paper we therefore assess changes
in PM2.5 and ozone as the most important indica-
tors of human health impacts. Furthermore the effects
of increased nitrogen deposition are quantified by
the computation of exceedances of critical loads for
eutrophication of semi-natural soils.
2. Emissions from diesel cars— Reference vs.
WhatIf scenarios
Emissions as officially reported by European coun-
tries under the Convention on Long-range Transport
of Air Pollutants for the year 2013 are used as input
for the calculations (Wankm¨
uller et al 2015) (see also
WebDab
(www.ceip.at/ms/ceip_home1/ceip_home/
webdab_emepdatabase/). As the discrepancy between
Euro standards and real-world emissions for LDDVs
has
been
known
for
some
time
already,
the
emission factors used in European emission inven-
tories are not based upon Euro standards, but
rather
already
reflect
the
high
NOx
emissions
expected in real-world conditions (Ntziachristos and
Samaras 2009, HBEFA 2010, Katsis et al 2012).
According to ERMES (European Research Group
on Mobile Emission Sources, www.hbefa.net/d/pdf/
ERMES_NOX_EF_V20151009.pdf),
the
emissions
from passenger cars estimated with such tools should
be at least a factor of four larger than emissions would
have been if the vehicles had been complying with the
Euro emissions standards.
Here we conduct four runs:
• ‘Reference case’: Here the officially reported emis-
sions are used (including real driving emissions from
LDDVs) in the calculation of the health and environ-
mental impacts of the current situation. It is thus the
backdrop against which the other scenarios are to be
evaluated.
Reported emissions are however only given for all
LDDVs together. They are neither disaggregated by
fuel type nor by emission control stage (i.e. Euro
class) as needed for the scenario calculations. There-
foreweemploytheGAINSmodelthatiscalibratedto
the reported emissions and represents the necessary
details for all countries (Amann et al 2015), notably
how much NOx is emitted by diesel cars of a certain
emission control stage6.
For the scenario calculations we leave emissions
from all other sectors unchanged and only adjust NOx
emissions from LDDVs as follows:
• Scenario ‘WhatIf-Dlim’: This scenario assumes that
average on-road NOx emissions of LDDVs are at
the level of the respective diesel limit values. This
could represent emissions as intended by the legis-
lation under ‘normal conditions of use’. We apply
the respective emission rates to the whole fleet of
passenger cars and light duty diesel vehicles, as mea-
surements show that high on-road NOx emissions
are not limited to a certain manufacturer (BMVI
2016, UK Department for Transport 2016).
• Scenario ‘WhatIf-Petrol’: This scenario assumes that
average on-road NOx emissions of diesel cars are as
low as the respective on-road emissions of petrol
cars of the same age and emission standard. Petrol
powered cars comply with stricter NOx emission
limits in the European Union than diesel cars.
Here we assume that no discrimination would be
made by propulsion type as is the case in the US
legislation.
6 GAINS is set-up in five year intervals. Therefore emission shares
used here are actually interpolated between 2010 and 2015.

emissions from all other sources, including off-road mobile machinery, and ‘add rem. traffic’ is emissions from road traffic other than
LDDVs. Emissions from LDDVs are shown as the cumulative sums of ‘Add WhatIf-Petrol’, ‘Add WhatIf-Dlim’ and ‘Add Reference’.
See text for definitions and further explanation.
• Scenario ‘WhatIf-NoLDDV’: Lastly, we set NOx
emissions from LDDVs to zero. This model run
is used to calculate the impacts of NOx emissions
from all other sources except LDDVs. The differ-
ence between the Reference case and NoLDDVs can
then be interpreted as the health and environmental
burden from these vehicles, and as such represents a
scale against which the effects of WhatIf-Petrol and
WhatIf-Dlim can be measured.
Figure 1 illustrates the distributions between non
traffic emissions, and traffic emissions split between
reference driving emissions and the scenario emis-
sions of NOx for the EU28+ countries, both in Gg
and in percent. The contributions from the different
sources/scenarios are stacked so that the total emis-
sions from LDDVs from the individual countries are
shownasthesumsofthe‘WhatIfPetrol’,‘WhatIfDlim’
and ‘Reference’ emissions. Thus, emissions exceeding
‘WhatIf Dlim’ are shown in red labelled ‘Add reference’
in the figure. Further reductions that could have been
achieved with ‘WhatIf Petrol’ are shown in yellow
labelled‘AddWhatIf-Dlim’.IntheEU28+countrieswe
find that excess NOx emissions from LDDVs account
for up to 15% of national emissions. Remaining traffic
emissions are essentially trucks and petrol cars.
We calculate the ‘WhatIf’ NOx emissions account-
ing for different shares, ages and annual mileages of
diesel cars in each European country. These ‘WhatIf’
emissions replace the LDDV emissions in the Refer-
ence case (data documented in table 1). Their spatial
andtemporaldistributionisequaltotheReferencecase,
even though in reality this percentage is likely to differ
from one region to another within the countries. Emis-
sions from all other sources are left unchanged, i.e. as
officiallyreportedbythecountries.Concentrationsand
impacts are calculated through for these counterfactual
scenarios and results compared to the reference case
with actual driving emissions. (It can be noted that the
GAINS and EMEP LDDV emissions differ slightly, but
the discrepancy of about 4% has little impact on our
calculations.)

3. Model calculations
InthisstudyweusetheEMEP/MSC-Wchemicaltrans-
port model, version rv4.8. This model, available as
open source (www.emep.int), has been described in
detail in Simpson et al (2012), with various updates,
see (Simpson et al 2016) and references within.
For Europe the model is regularly evaluated against
measurements in the EMEP annual reports, available
at www.emep.int. In addition the EMEP model has
been included in model intercomparisons and model
validations in a number of peer reviewed publications
(Jonson et al 2006, Jonson et al 2010, Simpson et al
2006, Simpson et al 2006, Colette et al 2011, Colette
et al 2012, Angelbratt et al 2011, Dore et al 2015,
Stjern et al 2016).
The model is run with a 0.1 × 0.1 degrees res-
olution driven by ECMWF-IFS meteorology and
emissions as described in section 2. A comprehen-
sive description, including model evaluations, of the
model results with the 0.1 × 0.1 degrees application
of the EMEP model for 2013 can be found in
Tsyro et al (2015). All model runs have been made for a
single year, 2013. More details about the model, includ-
ing specifications of the model validation, is included
in the supplementary data.
3.1. Health impacts from PM2.5
Following the methodology recommended for Euro-
pean health impact assessments by the HRAPIE
(Health risks of air pollution in Europe) project
(HRAPIE 2013) of the World Health Organization, the
assessment of PM2.5 health effects is based on estimates
of the impact of long-term (annual average) exposure
to PM2.5 on all-cause (natural) mortality in adult pop-
ulations (age >30 years). For the PM2.5 concentrations
prevailing in Europe, a linear concentration–response
function is employed, with a relative risk coefficient
of 1.062 (95% confidence interval (CI) 1.040−1.083)
per 10𝜇g m−3. This relationship is applied to PM2.5
concentrations arising from anthropogenic emission
sources, while impacts from natural sources of PM2.5
remain unquantified.
In calculating the population exposure to PM2.5 it
is recognized that the resolution of the atmospheric
dispersion calculation is insufficient to reproduce
accurately measured urban background PM2.5 con-
centrations. To account for this, an urban increment
related to primary PM emissions from local low-
level sources is estimated by applying a downscaling
scheme based on a redistribution of primary PM con-
centrations according to the primary PM emission
densities from the domestic and transport sectors. A
detailed description of the methodology is given by
Kiesewetter et al (2015). The annual mean population-
weighted PM2.5 concentrations are used to calculate
premature mortality attributable to PM2.5 in country
i as:
mort𝑖 = PM2.5𝑖 × RRPM × deaths30𝑖
where:
mort𝑖
cases of premature mortality per year in
country i;
deaths30𝑖 baseline mortality (number of natural
adult deaths per year) in country i;
RRPM
relative risk per 𝜇g m−3 annual mean
PM2.5;
PM2.5𝑖

mean

emissions of NOx).
3.2. Health impacts from ozone
Following the methodology recommended for Euro-
pean health impact assessments by the HRAPIE project
(HRAPIE 2013), the assessment of effects due to
ozone is based on estimates of the impact of short-
term (daily maximum eight-hour mean) exposure to
ozone on all-cause mortality for all ages. This is cal-
culated by applying a linear function with a relative
risk coefficient of 1.0029 (95% CI 1.0014−1.0043)
per 10 𝜇g m−3. Using the modelled estimates of
the SOMO35 indicator, which quantifies the yearly
sum of the daily maximum eight-hour ozone con-
centrations exceeding a 35 ppb threshold, the annual
cases of premature mortality in country i attributable
to ozone are then calculated as:
mort𝑖 = (
SOMO35𝑖∕365) × RRO3 × deaths𝑖
where mort𝑖 and deaths30𝑖 are as given above, and:
RRO3
relative risk per ppb 8 h maximum
ozone concentration per day;
SOMO35𝑖

3.3. Exceedances of critical loads for eutrophication
A critical load (CL) is defined as ‘a quantitative esti-
mate of an exposure to one or more pollutants below
which significant harmful effects on specified sensitive
elements of the environment do not occur according
to present knowledge’ (Nilsson and Grennfelt 1988).
CLs are calculated for different receptors (e.g. terres-
trial ecosystems, aquatic ecosystems), and a sensitive
element can be any part (or the whole) of an ecosystem
or ecosystem process. CLs have been derived for several
pollutants. Here we restrict ourselves to CLs defined to
avoid the eutrophying effects of N deposition (critical
load of eutrophying N, CLeutN). Nitrogen also influ-
ences the acidity status of soils, but CLs of acidity are no
longer exceeded much in Europe (Slootweg et al 2015).
The CLeutN for a site is either derived empirically
or calculated from a simple steady-state mass balance
equation linking a chemical criterion (e.g. an accept-
able N concentration in soil solution that should not
be exceeded) with the corresponding deposition value.
Methods to compute CLs are summarised in the so-
called Mapping Manual UNECE (2004), see also De
Vries et al (2015), which is used within the Con-
vention on Long-range Transboundary Air Pollution
(www.unece.org/env/lrtap).
If deposition is higher than the CL at a site, the
CL is said to be exceeded. The single exceedance num-
ber computed for a grid cell (or any other region) is
the so-called average accumulated exceedance (AAE),
defined as the weighted mean of the exceedances of all
ecosystems within the grid cell, with the weights being
the respective ecosystem areas (Posch et al 2001).

4. Results
Here we briefly describe the Reference situation, i.e.
pollution and their impacts from our best estimate of
emissions for the year 2013. Then we identify what
part of this pollution can be attributed to emissions
from light duty diesel vehicles as the difference between
the Reference and WhatIf scenarios. Finally, we esti-
mate the additional effects on human health and the
environment from LDDV NOx emissions.
4.1. LDDVs: effects on ambient concentrations
Figure 2 shows the year 2013 model calculated levels of
NO2, PM2.5, SOMO35 and depositions of nitrogen for
the Reference case.
The spatial pattern of the NO2 concentrations
(figure 2(a)) is very similar to the NOx emissions as
the residence time of NO2 is short (often just hours
in daytime). Concentration hot-spots are seen in the
countries close to the English Channel and in the Po
Valley in northern Italy.
PM2.5 concentrations (figure 2(b)) are in partic-
ular high in the Po Valley. Ozone concentrations,
and subsequently SOMO35, increase from north to
south as temperature and sunshine levels increase
towards the Mediterranean (figure 2(c)). High nitro-
gen depositions are seen in the Po Valley and in
and around the English Channel (figure 2(d)). A
detailed description of these concentrations, and depo-
sitions of nitrogen, is provided in the supplementary
data.
The geographic pattern is quite different for the
pollutants in figure 2. Therefore we can also expect
different outcomes for each of the impact indicators
calculated here. Figure 3 presents the differences in
air pollutant concentrations and eutrophication that
we can allocate to NOx emissions from LDDVs. More
material illustrating the effects of LDDVs for the indi-
vidual EU28+ countries (also in percent) for the three
WhatIf scenarios is included in the supplementary
material.
In several regions contributions corresponding to
30% and more of NO2 can be attributed to the LDDV
NOx emissions, particularly in northern Italy, France,
and Belgium (figure 3(a)).
Major contributions to PM2.5 levels from LDDV
NOx emissions are calculated for parts of the Alpine
region and the whole of France, with the Po Valley

Given the nonlinear behaviour in the response of
ozone to changes in NOx emissions, the effects of the
WhatIf scenarios varies across Europe. The contribu-
tions to SOMO35 are shown in figure 3(c). In high
NOx emitting areas, such as the countries border-
ing the southern parts of the North Sea, parts of the
Po Valley and for several large cities, the SOMO35
levels are reduced due to titration effects following
additional NOx emissions. Ozone levels are increased
by up to 10% in large parts of France, Spain and
Portugal, and somewhat less in the rest of southern
and central Europe. In particular in southern Europe
reductions in SOMO35 could have been achieved with
lower NOx emissions.
Before being deposited, nitrogen species can be
transported over relatively large distances (Hertel
et al 2012). As shown in the supplementary material
the additional NOx emissions from LDDVs result in
increased nitrogen depositions all over Europe, with
notable contributions of up to 10% again in the Po
Valley, but also large areas from Scandinavia south to
the Mediterranean.
The effects of these scenarios on EU28+ as a whole
are given in table 2, suggesting that concentrations
and depositions would be reduced by about 50% if
emission factors from LDDVs complied with diesel
limit values (WhatIf-Dlim). If emission factors could
bemadecomparabletopetrolvehicles(WhatIf-Petrol),
this would reduce concentrations and depositions
from LDDVs by about 80%.
4.2. Health effects
More than 400 000 and 15 500 premature deaths have
been associated with the current PM2.5 and ozone con-
centrations respectively in EU28+ (EEA 2016). We
estimate that about 3.5% of PM2.5 and 2.3% of ozone
premature deaths can be attributed to the NOx emis-
sions from diesel LDDVs (difference reference to no
LDDV emissions). We calculate that about 9390 cases
of premature deaths can be attributed to PM2.5 from
LDDVs in EU28+7, and 392 to ozone (see table 2).
As seen in figure 4(a) almost 50% (about 4500) of
7 Our own bottom-up impact assessment estimates only some
260 000 premature deaths attributable to PM2.5 in EU28. The lower
value compared to the EEA assessment is largely due to lower average
PM2.5 concentrations that we calculated. Based on the EEA figures,
3.5% of PM2.5 related premature deaths would imply about 13300
deaths. For ozone we calculate about 16 250 premature deaths, close
to the EEA result.

 Environ. Res. Lett. 12 (2017) 094017
the premature deaths could have been avoided if NOx
emissions from LDDVs on the road would have been
as in the test laboratory, i.e. no more than the emis-
sion limit value. Had diesel cars emitted as little NOx as
petrol cars, almost four out of five of these premature
deaths could have been avoided. Almost all countries
would have benefitted in roughly equal proportions,
see figure 4(b). In a recent study Anenberg et al (2017)
attribute almost 6900 premature deaths to excess NOx
emissions from LDDVs in EU28+ in the year 2015.
Given the different modelling set-up and uncertainties
in fleet emissions, atmospheric dispersion and health
impacts, this independent estimate is in good agree-
ment. Furthermore, they attribute about an additional
4650 premature deaths from heavy duty trucks and
buses. According to our calculations, the countries
with
the
highest
number
of
premature
deaths
attributable to PM2.5 induced from LDDVs are Italy,
Germany and France (figure 4(b)) resulting from their
large populations and high share of diesel cars in their
national fleets. These three countries comprise two
thirds of premature deaths from excess NOx emissions
of LDDV in EU28+ in the year 2013. The highest num-
ber of premature deaths per inhabitant attributable
to LDDV emissions occurs in Italy, Switzerland and
Belgium. With 2.85 to 4.4 cases per 100 000 inhabi-
tants the risk in these countries is 40% to 140% higher
than the EU28+ average (1.8 cases per 100 000 inhabi-
tants). The lowest risk for premature death because of
LDDV related NOx emissions is in Norway, Finland
and Cyprus where the risk is at least 14 times lower
than the EU28+ average.
There are some 392 cases of premature deaths
attributable to ozone exposure in EU28+ as a con-
sequence of excess LDDV NOx emissions. This value is
more than 30 times lower than the PM2.5 attributed
premature deaths. A compliance with diesel emis-
sion limits or even petrol emission limits would have
resulted in one quarter and almost two thirds fewer
premature deaths in EU28+. This is lower than the
correspondingchangeinNOx emissionsandalsolower
thantheinducedPM2.5 concentrationsbecauseground
level ozone formation scales in a nonlinear way with the
NOx emissions. In some countries (Belgium, Nether-
lands, United Kingdom) the extra NOx emissions from
LDDVs have actually led to less ozone being formed.
Thus, for these countries a reduction in NOx emissions
from diesel cars, as simulated, would result in 70 to 90
more cases of ozone related premature deaths.
4.3. Eutrophication effects
Reference model calculations of exceedance (AAE)
of the critical loads of eutrophication in Europe are
shown in the supplementary material. The critical loads
are exceeded in about 60% of the European ecosystem
area, but with particularly large exceedances in the Po
Valley in Italy and along the Dutch–German border.
In addition to NOx, a large portion of the nitrogen
deposition is from ammonia emissions. As a result, the
contribution from LDDVs to the levels of exceedances
aremoderate,increasingtheareaexceededbyabout2%
in the EU28+, see table 2. However, there are marked
contributions from LDDVs in the Po Valley and in
western parts of France. In table 2 we show that had
the LDDVs emitted NOx according to the diesel limit
about half of the exceedance could have been avoided,
and if they had emitted as petrol vehicles most of the
additional exceedances could have been avoided.
5. Uncertainties
Model calculations are of course uncertain, but the
EMEP model has been extensively evaluated for many
pollutants in many different climates (see references
in section 3), and is among the best models operat-
ing in Europe today, e.g. Dore et al (2015). With a
0.1 × 0.1 degrees resolution we are not able to fully
resolve pollution levels at locations close to major
sources of traffic (Schaap et al 2015). Dispersion of
primary compounds such as NOx or primary PM2.5
could in principle be modelled with urban-scale mod-
els. However, such models are usually not capable of
modelling the medium to long range transport and
chemical formation of oxidants and aerosols. In any
case, fine-scale meteorology and emissions are not gen-
erally available for European-scale assessments such as
ours.
Methods extrapolating regional model results,
as the CITY-DELTA methods (http://ies-webarchive.
jrc.ec.europa.eu/citydelta/) or the Air Quality Re-
gridder Model (Theobald et al 2016), could be an
alternative, but such methods require an individual
treatment of each city, beyond the scope of this study.
Further, model uncertainties tend to be system-
atic rather than random, with small perturbations in
for instance emission inputs, leading to well-behaved
changes in output concentrations. In the scenario
calculations several additional assumptions are made
that may affect the uncertainty. As already discussed,
the emissions from diesel vehicles differ substantially
depending on make and model (Transport and Envi-
ronment 2016). The European emission reporting
guidelines are the same for all countries, but the vehi-
cle model mix is not. Therefore the exact emissions in
the individual countries will depend on the local fleet
mix. Subsequently the calculated effects are likely to be
a lower estimate in countries where the most polluting
brands and makes are popular. In addition NOx emis-
sions as officially reported (i.e. as used in our Reference
calculation) are likely to be revised upwards in the light
of recent findings (Keller et al 2017). Thus excess NOx
emissions may be higher than reported here. As a result
we believe that the calculated impacts are likely to be a
lower estimate.
As noted above, we are not able to resolve loca-
tions close to heavy traffic. However, the formation of
secondary PM and ozone happens on spatial scales of
8
 Environ. Res. Lett. 12 (2017) 094017
several tens of kilometers, and concentrations are rel-
atively uniform across larger regions. Therefore a finer
spatial resolution would likely not change our result
much.
The link between air pollution and health is well
established through projects such as the HRAPIE
project (HRAPIE 2013), but additional processing and
use of the model results will inevitably increase the
uncertainty to some extent.
In this paper health effects from LDDVs are only
considered for ozone and secondary particles from
NOx. The effects of primary emitted particles are not
included, as these emissions are within the emission
limits. Health effects from increased NO2 concentra-
tions are not included for lack of agreed risk factors and
uncertain overlap with PM health impacts.
Furthermore we assume that all populations have
the same health response to air pollution and that there
exists no interaction between ozone, PM2.5 and other
air pollutants. The paper does not account for other
health effects beyond adult mortality.
6. Conclusions
The calculations in this paper demonstrate how excess
NOx emissions from LDDVs lead to increased levels
of NO2, PM2.5, ozone and depositions of eutrophying
nitrogen in Europe. This increase in pollution levels
affects human health and the environment. The effects
as summed up for the EU28 countries as a whole are as
follows:
• Up to 10 000 premature deaths due to PM2.5 and
ozone formation can be attributed to high NOx
emissions from LDDVs in Europe in the year 2013.
• About half of these cases could have been avoided
if these vehicles would in real driving emit no more
than the EU limit value (as possibly will be achieved
with forthcoming legislation).
• About80%oftheimpactscouldhavebeenavoidedif
these vehicles would emit no more than petrol vehi-
cles (as achieved in the US with technology neutral
emission standards).
• Excessprematuredeathswillcontinueintothefuture
until LDDVs with high on-road NOx emissions have
been replaced, possibly from 2021 and onwards
when the final stage of the Euro 6 legislation is
intended to close the gap between the test cycle and
on-road emissions.
• NOx emissions from LDDVs contribute to the
exceedance of the critical loads of eutrophication
in Europe. About half of this additional exceedance
could have been avoided if LDDVs would emit no
more than the EU limit value, and about 80% if they
would emit no more than petrol cars.
There are signs that diesel penetration in Europe is
now going down, partly as a result of the ‘Dieselgate’
scandal. Dieselgate may also have the effect of expe-
diting the transition to electric vehicles and other
alternative fuel modes of transport. Several economic
studies, such as Bloomberg (2016) and the Fitch
report (www.fitchratings.com/site/pr/1013282), pre-
dict a strong growth in the electrification of the car
industry in the next decade that will inevitably reduce
all types of direct traffic emissions.
It is interesting to note that even though the cal-
culation chain, from emissions to pollution levels to
effects on human health and the environment, involve
several potentially nonlinear steps, the calculations are
close to linear. The 50%–80% changes in the emissions
of NOx from LDDVs studied here result in similar per-
centage changes in concentrations of NO2 and PM2.5,
and depositions of nitrogen, and furthermore in the
number of premature deaths and in the exceedances of
critical loads of eutrophication (both in amount and
ecosystem area). The exception is ozone, where the
percentage changes in ozone (as SOMO35) and in pre-
mature deaths are smaller than the changes in NOx
emissions as result of NOx titration in some highly
polluted regions.
