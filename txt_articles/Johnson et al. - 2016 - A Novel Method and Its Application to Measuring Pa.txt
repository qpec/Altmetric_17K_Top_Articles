Abstract
This work aimed to develop an in vivo approach for measuring the duration of human bioaer-
osol infectivity. To achieve this, techniques designed to target short-term and long-term
bioaerosol aging, were combined in a tandem system and optimized for the collection of
human respiratory bioaerosols, without contamination. To demonstrate the technique,
cough aerosols were sampled from two persons with cystic fibrosis and chronic Pseudomo-
nas aeruginosa infection. Measurements and cultures from aerosol ages of 10, 20, 40, 900
and 2700 seconds were used to determine the optimum droplet nucleus size for pathogen
transport and the airborne bacterial biological decay. The droplet nuclei containing the
greatest number of colony forming bacteria per unit volume of airborne sputum were
between 1.5 and 2.6 μm. Larger nuclei of 3.9 μm, were more likely to produce a colony
when impacted onto growth media, because the greater volume of sputum comprising the
larger droplet nuclei, compensated for lower concentrations of bacteria within the sputum of
larger nuclei. Although more likely to produce a colony, the larger droplet nuclei were small
in number, and the greatest numbers of colonies were instead produced by nuclei from 1.5
to 5.7 μm. Very few colonies were produced by smaller droplet nuclei, despite their very
large numbers. The concentration of viable bacteria within the dried sputum comprising the
droplet nuclei exhibited an orderly dual decay over time with two distinct half-lives. Nuclei
exhibiting a rapid biological decay process with a 10 second half-life were quickly
exhausted, leaving only a subset characterized by a half-life of greater than 10 minutes.
This finding implied that a subset of bacteria present in the aerosol was resistant to rapid
biological decay and remained viable in room air long enough to represent an airborne
infection risk.

 Introduction
Controlled experiments on the aging of airborne viruses and bacteria can contribute much to
our understanding of airborne respiratory infection transmission. However, such research has
to date focussed mainly on laboratory-generated aerosols, which can differ from natural respi-
ratory aerosols in their composition and mechanisms of production. There are several reasons
for these differences. Firstly, the viability and infectivity of airborne bacteria and viruses
depend strongly on the composition of the nebuliser suspension used to generate the aerosol
and on the propagation techniques used to produce the aerosolised infectious agents[1–5]. Sec-
ondly, the aerosol composition that a laboratory experiment aims to replicate will depend on
the specific location of aerosol production in the respiratory tract[6–9]. Finally, respiratory
tract infections alter the respiratory fluid composition[6] and probably change rates of aerosol
production[10]. Accurate replication of natural respiratory aerosol production and composi-
tion is therefore necessary in aerosol aging studies, but very difficult to substantiate because the
processes underlying natural bioaerosol production are not well defined.
Accurate control of aerosol aging is essential when studying the decay of airborne pathogen
infectivity. However, achieving this is complicated by the fact that the aerosol aging timeframes
over which bacteria and viruses lose their initial infectivity can be very broad[11]. A wide range
of aging intervals therefore needs to be considered.
Immediately upon exiting a subject’s respiratory tract, respiratory aerosols undergo rapid
desiccation and cooling[12, 13]. A lower limit for the aging intervals to be investigated is there-
fore set by the evaporation time required for the respiratory droplet to form a stable droplet
nucleus. Airborne respiratory droplet nuclei (DN) are usually assumed to be those with a diam-
eter of less than 5 μm[14, 15]. For the liquid respiratory fluid droplets that produce such DN,
the evaporation process achieves a stable equilibrium diameter within seconds at most[16].
This equilibrium size depends on both the dry volume of any non-volatile material in the DN,
and the amount of water retained by that material after evaporative equilibrium is established
[17]. The amount of water vapour retained, in turn depends on both the ambient relative
humidity (RH) and the hygroscopic salt content of the DN[17–20].
The mechanisms responsible for degrading pathogen infectivity during desiccation are not
fully understood but they appear to result partly from increased exposure to chemical and
physical agents such as oxygen free radicals and ultraviolet light[21–25]. This increased expo-
sure begins when the respiratory fluid is divided into small droplets during aerosolization, and
accelerates when the droplet volume decreases during evaporation.
One important mechanism of chemical degradation is the damage caused by oxidative stress
and the generation of oxygen free radicals[26]. The rate at which this damage occurs depends
on the defensive capabilities of the microbe and on the composition and size of the residual sol-
ute and biofilm remaining in the dried respiratory fluid which surrounds the cell after the ini-
tial evaporation phase[21–23, 27, 28]. This residue may act as a protective barrier against
cellular desiccation, inhibiting the migration of reactive species, which can damage the cell.
The rates at which these processes occur may vary with external (e.g. ambient RH and tempera-
ture), and internal factors (e.g. nutrient availability and the rate of microbial metabolism)[25,
28]. The range of timeframes needed to fully explore the infectivity of a bioaerosol may there-
fore extend well beyond the evaporation time.
The aim of this study was to develop and demonstrate an alternative in vivo strategy able to
access all timeframes using naturally produced respiratory aerosols to answer questions about
the potential for an airborne transmission route for existing and emerging human pathogens.
Through this we also sought to contribute to the scant literature on in vivo respiratory aging,
sampling and culture methods in the context of biological decay.

 Materials and Methods
We have previously described a wind tunnel based “time of flight” technique called the Expired
Droplet Investigation System (EDIS)[16] to examine the physical behaviour of respiratory
aerosols over very short time intervals (<60 s) following their release[7, 8, 16], however the
time of flight approach becomes impractical for durations exceeding 60 s. The need to examine
longer aging periods required the adaptation of rotating aerosol storage reservoir techniques
pioneered by Goldberg et al. in 1958[29, 30] and further developed by others[31–34] to permit
respiratory aerosol to be introduced directly into a rotating aerosol aging chamber.
These time of flight and explicitly timed aging approaches were combined as the Tandem
Aged Respiratory Droplet Investigation System (TARDIS), to enable the fixing of aerosol age
over very short to very long time frames. The TARDIS therefore consists of two subsystems, a
time of flight system known as the TARDIS-Tunnel and an explicitly timed rotating aging res-
ervoir known as the TARDIS-Rotator.
Experimental Setup
TARDIS-tunnel and Rotator systems.
The TARDIS-Tunnel, used to study the short-
term (t <60 s) aging of the respiratory aerosol is a low velocity wind tunnel that envelops the
human subject in a HEPA-filtered particle-free airflow. The airflow transports respiratory
emissions from the subject at a well-defined velocity. The aged respiratory emissions are then
collected and characterized in the downwind instrument module. This module can be posi-
tioned at different sampling locations along the tunnel to vary the aerosol time-of-flight from
the subject to the sampling point. A schematic diagram of the TARDIS-Tunnel is provided in
Fig B of the S1 File.
The TARDIS-tunnel extends the range previously achievable with the EDIS[16], improves
the sample collection efficiency via an isokinetic cone cluster that can be varied to match the
desired tunnel air velocity and allows characterization of the emissions with a broader array of
instrumentation. The technical details and parameters of the instrument module are described
in detail in Section A.1 of the S1 File.
The TARDIS-Rotator is used to study the longer-term aging of the respiratory aerosol (t
>60 s). It is a horizontally oriented rotating cylindrical drum equipped with subject and instru-
ment flow management interfaces. The interfaces allow in sequential order: (1) the purging of
the drum and the subject’s respiratory tract with HEPA-filtered particle free air; (2) the injec-
tion of respiratory aerosol directly from a human subject without contamination by room air,
and; (3) the aging and subsequent extraction of that aerosol for characterization.
Technical details concerning the rotating drum, inlet and outlet ports, sensor integration,
the drum rotation rate, aerosol handling and the subject and instrument interfaces are given in
Section A.2 of the S1 File. A schematic diagram is provided in Fig E of the S1 File.
Test duration limits are also discussed in the S1 File. These limits ensure high breathing air
quality, while constraining the sample humidity and temperature, so that aerosol aging occurs
under realistic room air conditions. They also restrict the fraction of respiratory aerosol parti-
cles re-inhaled by the subject in order to limit associated particle loss from the sample.
HEPA filtered room air was chosen as the background air source in the tunnel and rotator
because this purely mechanical filtration technique efficiently removes all particles from the air
while preserving the air’s gaseous makeup. Hence, this approach does not interfere with natu-
rally present gaseous oxidative species that may influence the lifetime of viable airborne patho-
gens. The room air particles removed by filtration could contain particulate phase oxidative
species however such material, being bound to the particle, is unable to interact directly with
the newly introduced respiratory aerosol particles that contain the pathogen of interest[35, 36].

 Instrumentation.
Both the TARDIS-tunnel and Rotator can accommodate a broad array
of instrumentation. The instruments used in the experiments presented here included an Opti-
cal Particle Counter (OPC, Lasair II 110, Particle Measuring Systems, Boulder CO, USA), a
6-stage Andersen Viable Cascade Impactor (ACI, Thermo Fisher Scientific, Waltham, MA
USA) and dual thermohygrometer probes (HC2-C04, Rotronic Instrument Corp, Bassersdorf
Switzerland). The TARDIS-rotator was also fitted with an ultrasonic flow meter (USF, Thor
Medical Systems, THRUD medical flow meter), which recorded bidirectional flow at 0.01 s
intervals. The USF recorded the flow of HEPA-filtered replacement air into the rotating reser-
voir as the subject inhaled from the reservoir, and the flow of displaced air out of the rotating
reservoir as the subject exhaled or coughed into the reservoir.
The OPC classifies particles according to their laser light scattering behaviour into 6 size
channels with lower diameter thresholds at 0.1, 0.2, 0.3, 0.5, 1.0 and 5.0 μm. This instrument
has a high sample flow rate of 28.3 L.min-1, permitting very low particle concentrations to be
measured in real time, which is needed because even under controlled conditions, respiratory
aerosols are present at low levels in comparison to ambient aerosols.
The ACI draws 28.3 L.min-1 of air and classifies airborne microbe-laden droplet nuclei into
six size channels having lower aerodynamic diameter thresholds of 7.0, 4.7, 3.3, 2.1, 1.1 and
0.6 μm[37]. Each of these six size fractions is impacted onto one of 6 agar plates loaded with a
growth medium selective for the organism of interest. Specific media were selected for use in
the ACI to preserve and culture the bacteria of interest[38, 39]. A range of other techniques
including liquid impingement devices such as the Coriolis μ (Bertin Technologies)[40] can be
adapted to work with the TARDIS.
The thermohygrometers continuously recorded temperature, humidity and water vapour
concentration measurements in both the sample and supply (i.e. dilution) air of the TARDIS-
tunnel and Rotator. These water vapour concentration measurements were used to determine
the amount of supply air, which was mixed with the aerosol exhaled by the subject.
Four additional measurement techniques intended for future use (not used in the current
study) were accommodated in and therefore influenced the design in terms of the required
aerosol capacity of the TARDIS-rotator. These were the Biosampler (SKC, PA USA) which
draws aerosol at 12.5 L.min-1, and consumes 63 L of aerosol; the Ultra Violet Aerodynamic
Particle Sizer (UV-APS model 3312, TSI, Shoreview MN USA), drawing 5 L.min-1 and con-
suming 25 L[41]; the Scanning Mobility Particle Sizer (SMPS) (Model 3936, TSI, Shoreview
MN USA) drawing 1 L.min-1 and requiring 10 L of aerosol [8, 42, 43]; and a tandem differential
mobility analyser (TDMA) [44–48] drawing aerosol at 2 L.min-1 and requiring 60 L of aerosol.
Fig 1 summarises the particle size ranges of each of the instruments and techniques accom-
modated by the TARDIS, the sizes of the aerosols present in respiratory emissions and the sizes
of bacteria and viruses potentially present in human respiratory aerosol (or more specifically
its airborne size fraction).
Experimental Procedure
During the TARDIS-tunnel tests, the subjects performed a 300 s voluntary coughing and
breathing manoeuvre inside the Tunnel’s subject module. Aerosol characterization and collec-
tion was simultaneously performed at the instrument module located a set distance downwind
of the patient. The measurements presented here were conducted using the OPC and ACI. The
distances chosen for the tests were 1, 2 and 4 metres so that for the 0.1 m s-1 air velocity setting
used in the tunnel, the resulting times of flight (aerosol ages) upon collection were 10, 20 and
40 s respectively. Tunnel blanks were conducted using an identical procedure to the subject
tests, but without a subject being present in the tunnel.

 For the TARDIS-rotator tests, the rotating chamber was first purged with HEPA-filtered
particle free air. The subject then breathed a continuous supply of HEPA-filtered room air for
120 s through a mouthpiece before commencing a 120 s voluntary coughing (i.e. coughing as
frequently and intensively as comfortably sustainable) manoeuvre. The manoeuvre was per-
formed through the mouthpiece, via which air was inhaled from and exhaled into the rotating
chamber. The rotating chamber was then isolated, and the aerosol inside was allowed to age
before undergoing analysis by OPC, and thermohygrometer and size classified collection onto
growth media by ACI. As with the TARDIS-tunnel, rotator blanks were conducted using an
identical procedure to the subject tests but without a subject present. For a detailed description
of the procedures see Sections B and C of the S1 File.
Quantitative Andersen Viable Cascade Impactor bioaerosol cultures were undertaken using
chocolate bacitracin (300 mg.ml-1) agar incubated aerobically at 35°C for 72 hours [38]. Quan-
titative and qualitative sputum cultures were performed using horse blood, chocolate bacitracin
(300 mg.ml-1), MacConkey Agar No. 2, mannitol salt and Burkholderia cepacia selective agars
incubated aerobically (or 5% CO2 where appropriate) at 35°C agar for 72 hours. A representa-
tive selection of presumptive Pseudomonas aeruginosa colonial morphotypes were selected
from the primary cultures, screened for cytochrome c oxidase and growth at 42°C, and then
confirmed as P. aeruginosa using duplex real-time polymerase chain reaction PCR[49]. Con-
firmed bioaerosol and sputum isolates were thereafter genotyped using enterobacterial repeti-
tive intergenic consensus-PCR (ERIC-PCR) and cluster analysed alongside a previously
characterized panel of Australian shared P. aeruginosa strains[50].
Subjects
The challenge aerosol used to test the TARDIS was produced by two male patients with cystic
fibrosis (CF); (aged 23 and 27 years) and chronically infected with P. aeruginosa. Both were
members of a larger cough aerosol study cohort[39]. Subjects were recruited from the adult CF
Centre at The Prince Charles Hospital (TPCH), Brisbane, Australia. Exclusion criteria included
recent pneumothorax and haemoptysis. Subjects S1 and S2 were randomly selected for addi-
tional analysis, from the ten highest producing patients in larger cough aerosol study cohort
[39]. Patients vary widely in their production of viable airborne P. aeruginosa bearing DN and
Fig 1. Relationship between respiratory aerosol and instrumentation size ranges and bacterium and virus dimensions. Only the ACI and OPC
techniques were employed in the current study.

 in some cases this limits the level of analysis which can be performed. For example, for low pro-
ducing patients it is not possible to clearly resolve and characterize dual mechanism, pathogen
decay behaviour. The selection of patients with high cough aerosol production permitted a
clear demonstration of the more detailed analysis, which can be achieved using the TARDIS
with high viable DN production rates.
Both subjects attended two non-successive (to allow for recovery) study days, one for the
TARDIS-tunnel test and one for the Rotator test. A sputum sample was used to confirm infec-
tion status at the time of testing. These two subjects, designated S1 and S2 in the current analy-
sis, corresponded to subjects S15 and S7 of our previous publication[39]. S1 was a 23 year old
male and had moderately-severe bronchiectasis (FEV1−57.7% predicted), undernutrition (BMI
20.9 kg.m-2), and chronic P. aeruginosa infection. This subject had a rapid and sustained clini-
cal decline over the 5 years prior to study and had completed an intravenous antibiotic treat-
ment course (IV Meropenem 1 g, tds and IV Tobramycin 320 mg od) for a pulmonary
exacerbation 6 days prior to his first study. Subject S1 had mucoid and non-mucoid P. aerugi-
nosa cultured in the sputum on the day of the study and in the prior 12 months. In addition,
Stenotrophomonas maltophilia was isolated on one occasion 9 months prior to the study date.
S2 had moderately-severe bronchiectasis (FEV1−50.9% predicted), undernutrition (BMI 24.8
kg.m-2), and chronic P. aeruginosa infection. This subject was clinically stable over the 5 years
prior to and at the time of study (17/912) with the most recent course of intravenous antibiotics
administered 5 weeks prior to the study date. Subject S2 also had evidence of mucoid and non-
mucoid P. aeruginosa cultured in the sputum on the day of the study and only mucoid P. aeru-
ginosa in the prior 12 months.
The study was approved by the Queensland Royal Children’s Hospital Human Research
and Ethics Committee (HREC/11/QRCH/44), The University of Queensland Medical Research
Ethics Committee (2012000615) and the Queensland University of Technology University
Human Research Ethics Committee (1100000618). Written consent was obtained from both
subjects. Cough manoeuvres were supervised by a healthcare professional and emergency
equipment was available in the event of an adverse event.
Data Analysis
The concentration of viable bacteria in the aerosol was based on the number of colonies
appearing on the ACI agar plates during incubation. Total colony forming unit counts (CFU)
on each agar plate of the ACU were obtained by counting the number colonies present and
then applying a statistical coincidence correction for overlapping colonies[37, 51]. The cor-
rected CFU count was then divided by the volume of air sampled by the ACI to obtain the con-
centration of viable bacteria in the aerosol.
Dilution factor (DF) normalization.
Dilution factor (DF) normalization of the measured
total and viable aerosol concentrations was used to estimate the undiluted concentrations in
the breath. This normalization consisted of multiplying the concentrations measured in the
sample by a breath dilution factor. For viable and total particles these undiluted concentrations
represented the concentrations that would have been obtained if the undiluted breath had been
aged at the humidity and temperature of the diluted sample. DF normalization effectively elim-
inates aerosol concentration variance caused by differences in dilution between individual tests
within each, and across both, of the two aging systems. The DF normalized concentrations can
therefore be directly compared to reveal differences in total and viable aerosol production in
experiments involving different subjects, and/or using different aging intervals.
Two different methods were used to determine DFs for the samples. Firstly, a water vapour
based method derived the DF from the dilution of the vapour present in the exhaled breath.

 Secondly, a flow-based method was used to obtain an estimate of DF from measurements of
the volume flows of exhaled breath and room air which were combined (at constant tempera-
ture and pressure) to create the sample. For practical reasons the latter method could not be
implemented in the TARDIS-tunnel system, but both methods were applied in the Rotator to
provide validation of the humidity-based approach. Comparison of the water vapour and flow-
based measurements of dilution showed that the water vapour based technique was accurate to
within ±15%. The detailed rationale and approach taken to correct the TARDIS-tunnel and
Rotator measurements for dilution are described in Section E of the S1 File. Examples of the
dilution factor measurement and the validation of the water vapour based method are also pre-
sented there.
Total aerosol (TA) normalization.
Where analysis focussed specifically on the behaviour
of the bacteria, total aerosol (TA) normalization was preferred over DF normalization because
it produced a direct measure of the aerosol’s bacterial viability independent of the subject’s
aerosol production rate. Like DF normalization, the TA normalization approach removed dilu-
tion-associated variance but it offered the added advantage of removing variance associated
with aerosol production and deposition loss. TA normalization consisted of dividing the CFU
concentrations by the corresponding total aerosol concentrations to obtain the number of CFU
per particle. In an extension of this approach, CFU concentrations could also be divided by the
total aerosol volume concentration (calculated using the aerosol size distribution measured by
the OPC) to obtain the number of CFU yield per unit volume of sputum.
Alignment of the OPC and ACI data. The calculation of the size distribution of CFU
yield per droplet nucleus required that the OPC and ACI data were aligned on a size basis and
presented using a common scaling. To achieve alignment of the OPC data size ranges with
those of the ACI, the OPC dCn versus OPC lower channel boundary (DL-OPC) data was
rescaled as dCn/dLogD at each of the OPC channel geometric mean diameters (DGMD-OPC). A
curve fit to the dCn/dLogD data could then be remapped to the ACI channel GMDs
(DGMD-Imp) via interpolation. The resulting ACI channel based size distribution was then
rescaled as dCn versus the corresponding ACI channel lower boundaries (DL-Imp) to determine
the concentrations which impacted each ACI plate.
Results
Results concerning the TARDIS’s performance and the aging of pathogen-laden aerosols pro-
duced by two individuals with CF (S1 and S2), and chronically infected with P. aeruginosa, are
presented below. The cough aerosols were aged for 10, 20, 40, 300, 900 and 2700 s as follows.
For short term aging, two repeated tests denoted test A and test B were conducted in the TAR-
DIS-tunnel at distances of 1m, 2m and 4m, which corresponded to aerosol aging intervals of 10
s, 20 s and 40 s respectively. For long-term aging, two repeated tests were conducted in the
Rotator at aerosol ages of 300 s and 900 s, and a single test was conducted at 2700 s of aging.
Breath dilution
Table 1 shows the sample dilution conditions that occurred in the TARDIS-tunnel and Rotator.
The resulting DF ranged from 9 to 15 in the TARDIS-rotator and from 22 to 46 in the TAR-
DIS-tunnel. The DF was considerably more variable in the tunnel and showed a gradual
increase with distance from the subject due to the increasing dispersion of the cough plume.
Dilution also differed between the two subjects, being consistently higher for S1 than S2 in
both the tunnel (S1 being 42% higher than S2) and the rotator (S1 being 31% higher). This was
caused by marked differences in the two subjects’ mean ventilation rates during the coughing
and breathing manoeuvre, with S1 coughing and breathing at mean flow rates of 14.8–17.4 L.

 min-1 as measured by the ultrasonic flow meter during rotator tests, compared to S2 coughing
and breathing at 19.0–23.5 L.min-1. This led to a smaller contribution of the breath being
mixed into the samples obtained from S1 than those from S2, and hence a higher dilution fac-
tor for S1. Dilution was found to be more consistent across multiple tests for the rotator
because the exhaled breath was always more fully captured within that apparatus.
Aerosol size distributions
Fig 2 shows the average dilution corrected size distributions recorded by the OPC and ACI
over two successive experiments using the TARDIS-tunnel and the TARDIS-rotator. The
uncorrected data are presented in Figs M and N of the S1 File.
Aerosol production variance in the TARDIS.
Differing levels of dilution between the two
systems were not the sole source of difference in concentration between TARDIS-tunnel and
Rotator tests as revealed by the DF normalized concentrations, (Fig 2). The effect of dilution
was removed by normalization, yet the normalized concentrations still showed consistent dif-
ferences between TARDIS-tunnel and Rotator measurements for both subjects. Fig 3 shows
that the production efficiency when coughing in the TARDIS-rotator was consistently only
40% of that in the Tunnel for diameters up to 1 μm, and it fell to 10% at the largest measured
sizes. It is possible that some moderation of the cough strength occurred when the subject used
a mouthpiece and nose clip to cough into the drum when compared with unencumbered
coughing in the Tunnel.
Total aerosol normalisation to eliminate dilution and production variance.
The viable
P. aeruginosa laden DN number concentrations in each ACI size class in the diluted cough
aerosol after aging for 10, 20, 40, 300, 900 and 2700 s are presented for subject S1 in Fig 4A.
Corresponding total DN number concentrations are shown in Fig 4B. The TA normalized val-
ues are effectively the ratio of these previous two size distributions expressed as the number of
CFU yielded per DN as shown in Fig 4C. Fig 4D shows the same TA normalised values, after
scaling by the particle volume. This represents the concentration of viable P. aeruginosa in the
sputum at each DN size or CFU yield per unit airborne sputum volume. Fig 4E shows the
equivalent result for subject S2.
Discussion
Performance of the TARDIS
After developing and testing the system, we can report that: (1) The TARDIS provided a practi-
cal in-vivo approach to aging respiratory aerosols that permitted both short and long-term
aging. The aerosol was collected directly from a human subject into particle free air and aged at
room air temperature and humidity for 10–2700 s (or longer). (2) Contamination from other
(e.g. non-respiratory) aerosol sources was carefully excluded throughout collection, aging and

 sample characterization, and verified by numerous blank sample characterizations. Cultures
from samples collected without a subject present showed no evidence of colony formation.
Similarly we were able to use the OPC prior to and after sample extractions to show that no
room air contamination occurred (Sections B and C of the S1 File). (3) Dilution of the exhala-
tion was calculated from the dilution of the exhaled water vapour to an accuracy of ±15%, as
verified by an independent measurement technique based on exhaled air and dilution air con-
tributions to the sample. (4) The system accommodated a full suite of droplet nuclei characteri-
zation instrumentation, chosen to provide comprehensive size and concentration
measurement across the airborne size range, and beyond. More broadly, our system represents
a useful means to accurately probe the physical and biological characteristics of human
Fig 2. TARDIS-tunnel and Rotator based measurements of the size distribution of the aerosol for
subjects S1 and S2. The concentrations are DF normalized to the point of origin in the respiratory tract and
represent average concentrations within each OPC and ACI size channel. They are based on measurements
recorded by the OPC and ACI. Diameters represent the lower boundaries of each OPC and ACI size channel.
Measurements in the tunnel were at distances of 1 m (10 s of aging), 2 m (20 s) and 4 m (40 s). Those in the
rotator were made after durations of 300 s, 900 s, and 2700 s. Note that the horizontal axis scale differs in the
upper and lower panels.

 respiratory aerosols, that has applications in addressing the relatively poorly defined role of
such aerosols in communicable infection.
Patient safety was carefully maintained through appropriate measures built into the design
and protocols. These measures ensured the maintenance of appropriate CO2 and O2 levels
within the system, limited the duration of subject testing, eliminated potential sources of cross
infection and ensured suitable patient supervision by trained health professionals. Exclusion of
contamination during sample collection, characterization, extraction, and handling was care-
fully verified through the previously described blank sample characterization procedures. No
P. aeruginosa or other microbes identified in cough aerosols were isolated from the surface
swabs or blank aerosol samples. However numerous colonies were found in identical treatment
of cough aerosol from infected patients. The P. aeruginosa genotypes isolated from the cough
aerosols of each patient were also 100% concordant with those cultured from the correspond-
ing sputum samples[39].
CF patient versus healthy subject cough aerosol concentrations
While insufficient to draw definite conclusions for the patient cohort as a whole given the
small sample size, our findings for these two patients strongly suggest that measurements of
cough aerosol production obtained from healthy subjects may be an inadequate basis for pre-
dicting airborne infection transmission risk. Individuals with CF were found to produce far
greater quantities of aerosol when they cough than healthy subjects previously tested in the
EDIS using the UV-APS during coughing[8, 16].
Table 2 shows that the DF normalized (ie undiluted breath) cough aerosol number concen-
trations for particles of 1μm in diameter and larger were two orders of magnitude greater than
the mean DF normalized concentration in the same range as previously recorded using similar
techniques for healthy subjects during coughing[8]. The mean concentrations in this size range
for subjects S1 and S2 were 20.1 cm-3 and 22.5 cm-3 for S1 and S2 respectively; while the mean
overall for a healthy subject group tested previously was 0.22 cm-3[8].
DN size producing the largest numbers of bacterial colonies (2.6 μm)
DN of different sizes had varying probabilities of delivering viable bacteria. This was evident
through a marked difference between the viable (colony forming DN) cough aerosol size
Fig 3. Ratio of the mean of the normalised aerosol concentrations produced when using the TARDIS-
rotator to that when using the TARDIS-tunnel.

 distribution (Fig 4A) and total (irrespective of colony formation) aerosol size distribution (Fig
4B) shape and concentration.
The viable DN size distribution, in combination with particle size dependent deposition
probabilities in the various regions of the respiratory tract, together determine the likelihood of
delivering viable bacteria to a susceptible region of the respiratory tract. In these two subjects
the viable DN concentration peaked at a Geometric Mean Diameter (GMD) between 2.6 μm
and 3.9 μm. These DN sizes produced the largest number of colonies on the ACI plates as
shown in Fig 4A. This outcome resulted from the distribution of total DN concentration versus
size as displayed in Fig 4B being modified by the probability distribution of individual DN of
each size carrying a viable bacterial load as displayed in Fig 4C. Most of the DN were 1.5 μm
and smaller in diameter, but the P. aeruginosa colonies were produced mainly by DN which
were 1.5 μm or larger in diameter.
The probability of deposition in the respiratory tract for particles larger than 1 μm, strongly
favours deposition in the uppermost regions of the respiratory tract[52]. Nevertheless, 10–15%
of particles in the 1–4 μm range deposit in the alveoli, implying that significant fractions of via-
ble bacteria are likely to be deposited in this region for bystanders inhaling the aerosol[52].
DN size most likely to contain viable bacteria (3.9 μm)
Smaller DN were far less likely to carry viable bacteria. The size distribution of the P. aerugi-
nosa CFU yield per DN (Fig 4C) revealed the relative capacity of droplets of different sizes to
deliver culturable bacteria. The optimum size for delivery corresponded to the peak of this size
distribution and this peak was shifted toward larger diameters relative to the viable aerosol size
distribution (Fig 4A). If we were to assume that a single source of aerosol produced all DN
from a common fluid reservoir containing a uniform concentration of bacteria, then the DN
size most likely to contain a viable bacterium should simply be the largest ones, because these
contain the most sputum. This single aerosol source assumption is tested and disproved in sec-
tion 4.6 below.
DN size containing the largest concentrations of bacteria (1.5–2.6 μm)
For minimally aged aerosols, the CFU yield per unit volume of airborne sputum (Fig 4D and
Fig 4E) was greatest for 1.5 and 2.6 μm droplet nuclei and decreased strongly as the size
increased beyond this limit. The decrease in yield at the largest sizes, strongly suggests a

 secondary source of larger DN in the respiratory tract, which was drawing on fluid that had a
lower bacterial load.
The CFU concentration also declined at the small end of the scale, falling suddenly to zero
below 1.5 μm (the exact cut off was between 0.8 and 1.5 μm). This cut-off reflects the physical
limitation imposed by the size of the P. aeruginosa organism, which is approximately cylindri-
cal in shape, with a characteristic (geometric mean) diameter between 0.87 and 1.5 μm[53].
This range therefore represents the smallest possible DN containing the bacterium. No such
limitation applies to non-viable droplet nuclei.
Evidence of multiple source regions with different bacterial loads
Consistent with the observation of multiple source regions reported previously for cough aero-
sol from healthy subjects[7, 8], multiple aerosol source regions with different bacterial loads
appear to exist within the respiratory tract, giving rise to different but overlapping droplet size
distributions. The evidence for this finding is described in the following three paragraphs.
If a single reservoir of homogenous respiratory fluid had produced DN of all sizes, then
larger DN should have contained more bacteria than smaller DN and therefore should have
exhibited a correspondingly higher probability of colony formation per DN. Although such a
trend began in Fig 4C for diameters up to 3.9 μm, the curve representing CFU/DN versus
diameter did not sustain the expected trend beyond that size. This finding implies one of two
possibilities: (1) large droplets were inhospitable to the P. aeruginosa organism; or (2) the single
reservoir hypothesis is wrong and at least two distinct fluid reservoirs with different bacterial
loads gave rise to two overlapping droplet size ranges (ie two size distribution modes with dis-
tinct characteristic diameters).
Possibility 1 is unlikely because the shear forces needed to break a fluid into droplets
increase as the droplet size decreases. These shear forces also affect bacteria, so P. aeruginosa in
the smaller droplets are more likely to be damaged during aerosolization. Furthermore, the
process of pathogen degradation (at least for gram negative bacteria) while airborne in exhaled
aerosol droplets, results partly from oxygen toxicity whereby oxidation by O2 and O3 can pro-
duce toxic products that damage bacterial cells[21–24]. Larger droplets take much longer to
evaporate and present a greater barrier to the entry by diffusion, of destructive oxidative chemi-
cal species thereby impeding their approach to the embedded bacteria from the surrounding
air.
The evidence therefore supports possibility 2, where multiple aerosol source regions with
different bacterial loads exist within the respiratory tract such that these aerosol sources give
rise to different but overlapping droplet size distributions. This finding is consistent with the
observation of multiple source regions reported previously for cough aerosol from healthy sub-
jects[7, 8], because respiratory infection is unlikely to be uniformly distributed throughout the
respiratory tract.
Bacteria were associated with right tail of a broad submicrometer DN
size distribution peak extending to diameters larger than 3.9 μm
The increasing concentrations of DN seen at smaller sizes in Fig 4B imply that the production
mode for the small DN is quite broad, and is centred in the submicrometer range however
most of the resulting DN are smaller than the P. aeruginosa bacterium.
A complex aerosol generation system such as the human respiratory tract during coughing
is likely to include multiple sources of aerosol and each of these will have its own characteristic
aerosol size distribution mode[7, 8]. These modes combine to produce a multimodal aerosol

 size distribution, consisting of overlapping lognormal curves (one for each production mode),
each with a characteristic median diameter and spread.
Again comparing Fig 4D and 4E to Fig 4B, it can be concluded that the fluid feeding the pro-
duction of the smallest DN must have been far richer in bacteria than that which fed the dis-
tinct process that produced most of the larger DN. This second production mechanism is not
resolved in the size distribution of Fig 4B, due to a lack of sufficient size resolution in the OPC
measurements. Nonetheless it appears to have produced significant numbers of bacteria-poor
DN in the 3.9 μm to 5.7 μm range in order to have reduced the mean concentration of bacteria
in the airborne sputum for DN of those sizes to well below the concentration seen at the smaller
diameters, where the submicrometer mode dominates the population of DN. The increasing
concentrations of DN seen at smaller sizes in Fig 4B imply that the production mode for the
small DN is quite broad, and is centred in the submicrometer range.
Bacteria were associated with aerosol from the lower respiratory tract
It is therefore probable that at least two aerosol-generation processes were occurring at differ-
ent regions of the respiratory tract. We have previously shown that multiple droplet production
mechanisms produced progressively larger characteristic droplet sizes at higher points in the
healthy respiratory tract[8]. The observation, which is reported for the first time, of a decreas-
ing CFU yield per unit volume of respiratory tract fluid with increasing DN diameter, suggests
(assuming that the sites of aerosol production are similar to those in healthy subjects) that the
viable concentration was smaller in the middle and upper regions of the respiratory tract of
these patients. Active bacterial shedding therefore appears to occur predominantly in the lower
respiratory tract in at least these two patients. Using an in vitro system Clifton and colleagues
demonstrated that P. aeruginosa strains expressing a mucoid phenotype showed a survival
advantage within aerosols when compared to non-mucoid strains[54]. In the current study we
isolated mucoid and non-mucoid morphotypes from the aerosol cultures in both subjects.
However, given the small sample size, the nature of the model, the presence of mixed P. aerugi-
nosa morphotype infections, and a predominance of the mucoid phenotype in both sputum
and aerosol cultures we were unable to determine if there were any differences in survival asso-
ciated with colonial phenotype or biofilm mode of growth.
Two decay processes degrade bacterial viability
The decay of bacterial viability was very rapid in the first seconds of the aerosol’s release but
then slowed dramatically as the droplets aged. This result is comparable to a dual decay process
previously reported for aerosolised E. coli[23].
The orderly biological decay process occurring in the aging DN can be seen in Fig 5. Fitting
an exponential model revealed a dual exponential decay processes involving two distinct half-
lives; one of less than 10 s and a second of the order of 10 min. Similar dual decay processes
have been observed previously. Benbough[23], found that aerosolized Escherichia coli showed
an initial very rapid death rate, followed by a much slower secondary one. The initial rapid
decay was very sensitive to the RH and oxygen content of the atmosphere in the aging reservoir
while the slower decay was not. Replacing air in the aging reservoir with nitrogen almost elimi-
nated the rapid death process highlighting the role of oxygen toxicity.
Benbough’s E. coli experiments were conducted using a time resolution of 2.5 minutes or
larger, so the decay rate for the faster process was not resolved. The initial rapid decay for E.
coli exhausted itself between aerosol injection and the first 2.5 minute sample extraction mak-
ing a half life of the order of seconds plausible (the author described this decay as instanta-
neous). The secondary decay process had a half-life also of the order of 10 minutes. The time

 frames over which these decay processes played out appear to be comparable to those observed
in the current study. In any case the overlapping environmental mechanisms responsible for
the biological decay of E. coli might also apply to P. aeruginosa.
We wish to emphasise that these results (S2 also displayed dual decay) represent only two
high producing individuals selected from the full patient sample group. They were chosen to
facilitate a clear illustration of the utility of the aerosol collection methods used in our study.
The results therefore should not be taken as being representative of the wider patient group,
which as shown in our previous publication, displayed an overall mean bioaerosol biological
decay half-life of 50 minutes[39].
Slow decay is most relevant to potential airborne infection risk
It should also be noted that the very rapid initial decay process demonstrated here is relevant
to the study of mechanisms of biological decay in aerosol during the very early stages of aerosol
formation where dispersion is dominated by the explosive release from the respiratory tract.
Such rapid decay is perhaps of more limited interest when modelling the control of airborne
infection risk in the room air environment because the dispersion and air exchange processes
that influence exposure tend to act over longer time frames of the order of minutes not seconds.
It is therefore primarily the long-term decay (the focus of our previous paper[39]) that is likely
to influence any potential airborne transmission risk.
The size distribution of the CFU yield per unit DN volume for the two subjects is shown in
the two graphs to the left of Fig 6. Both subjects produced a clear maximum yield per unit vol-
ume of sputum near 2.5 μm. The concentration at this peak was similar to the measured CFU
yield per unit volume of conventionally collected sputum obtained from the patients. Allowing
for the fact that the DN, unlike the sputum sample, had dried and therefore shrunk in volume
while airborne, the maximum CFU yield per volume in the aerosol after 10 s of droplet aging
was of the order of 10% of that in the sputum sample. This implies that 90% of the organisms
may have lost viability within 10 s, which is consistent with the observed decay rate revealed at
the right hand side of the figure showing the decay behaviour at each DN size. Note that the
size specific mean concentration data points displayed greater variance than was the case for
the means taken across all DN sizes as used to examine the dual decay profile in Fig 5. The
decay profiles in Fig 6 were therefore fitted with simple power law functions rather than dual
exponential functions.
Summary of findings
The study produced a number of significant findings concerning cough aerosols produced by
individuals with CF and chronically infected with P. aeruginosa. Some of these findings are
summarised in Table 3.
The viable (colony producing) cough aerosol concentration peaked at 2.6 μm. The majority
of the DN were smaller than 1 μm in diameter, but P. aeruginosa colonies were produced pri-
marily by 1.5 μm or larger DN.
The aerosol size distribution peak was very broad, and was centred in the submicrometer
range, but the smallest and most numerous DN were too small to carry a P. aeruginosa bacte-
rium. The DN producing the largest numbers of colonies per unit volume of airborne sputum

 matter, were between 1.5 and 2.6 μm in diameter. These appeared to arise from the leading
edge of the broad submicrometer mode.
DN larger than 3.9 μm appeared to contain smaller concentrations of viable bacteria, sup-
porting the existence of multiple aerosol sources within the respiratory tract, producing aerosol
from fluid reservoirs containing different viable bacterial concentrations.
Two decay processes with very different half-lives acted to reduce bacterial viability. These
half lives were consistent with a dual decay process previously reported for aerosolised E. coli
[23].
