Abstract A shared goal of many researchers has been to discover how to improve health and
prevent disease, through safely replacing a large amount of daily sedentary time with physical
activity in everyone, regardless of age and current health status. This involves contrasting how
different muscle contractile activity patterns regulate the underlying molecular and physiological
responses impacting health-related processes. It also requires an equal attention to behavioural
feasibility studies in extremely unfit and sedentary people. A sound scientific principle is that the
body is constantly sensing and responding to changes in skeletal muscle metabolism induced by

far short of replacing most of the sedentary time in the modern lifestyle, because both the weekly
frequency and the weekly duration of exercise time are an order of magnitude less than those for
people sitting inactive. This can explain why high amounts of sedentary time produce distinct
metabolic and cardiovascular responses through inactivity physiology that are not sufficiently
prevented by low doses of exercise. For these reasons, we hypothesize that maintaining a high
metabolic rate over the majority of the day, through safe and sustainable types of muscular
activity, will be the optimal way to create a healthy active lifestyle over the whole lifespan.

Abstract figure legend The cause and effect influences impacting what is defined as a health active lifestyle. Beginning
at the top left, a sedentary lifestyle (with nearly ubiquitous sitting opportunities) results in infrequent skeletal muscle
contractile activity. An ensuing deleterious chain of events creates disease, poor ageing, and ultimately compounding
influences to create more sedentary behaviour. In contrast to the sedentary lifestyle, the right side of the diagram shows
the chain of events linked to high levels of activity.

Introduction
The purpose of this paper is to provide the historical
context and to update a paradigm that has emerged in
recent years that continues to shape our thinking about
the unique role that muscular activity performs over the
whole day in optimizing human physiology and pre-
venting disease (Hamilton et al. 2004, 2007, 2014). The
intended format is to use language capable of explaining
concepts to a general audience, and to put forth new
ideas as a way of raising provocative questions that foster
rigorous debate and promote scientific endeavour. The
article attempts to keep the content conceptually rich and
present it as a useful paradigm instead of being descriptive,
since there are numerous reviews for that already (Thorp
et al. 2011; Edwardson et al. 2012; Saunders et al. 2012;
Wilmot et al. 2012; Hamilton et al. 2014). In so doing,
this article could not be replete with the many excellent
references by colleagues in the field. My goal here in this
article as well as in my own laboratory is to lead the pursuit
for developing an approach to replace as many hours and
bouts of unhealthy sedentary time possible with the best type
of muscular activity specifically geared toward being safe,
feasible, and physiologically effective for optimizing human
health in all people, regardless of age and barriers limiting
mobility. This article will outline seven guiding tenets that
are intended to help show the way.
A basic yet sound understanding of muscle physio-
logy is critical to keep in mind when thinking about
how these tenets provide insights when both comparing
different types of activity and identifying the underlying
molecular causal factors. Working muscle fibres must
be fuelled, and the time course for changes in contra-
ctile activity is very dynamic. The magnitude of change
in the energetics and biochemistry of a muscle fibre
moving from an inactive to a recruited state (or vice
versa) is as large a difference as is seen in biology. Cellular
signals impacted by contractile activity drive numerous
metabolic and cardiovascular responses. For example,
when rats were experimentally made to become more
inactive throughout the day, and also when they started
moving again, there were changes in the activity of dozens
of genes regulating diverse processes (Bey et al. 2003).
And during that time, specific biochemical pathways that
determine the fate of fat and plasma cholesterol were
changing more than any other known processes (Bey &
Hamilton, 2003), and probably also innumerable other
biological processes still needing to be carefully studied.
There will probably also be many adaptive benefits specific
to the molecular responses that extend beyond the acute
timeframebymaintaininghabituallyhighlevelsofcontra-
ctile activity throughout the day. This fundamental back-
ground also impacts pragmatic issues needed to under-
stand the dose–response and time course relationships
for how to optimize human movement for promoting
betterhealth.Thisemergingfieldconcernedwithreducing
sedentary time is largely based on suggestions that a
high frequency and duration of movement may produce
sizeable health gains, even though the category of activity
is not strenuous. This would be especially impactful if
effective, low effort and safe muscular activity could be
performed with high durations and frequency in a more

universal way than the traditional models of how to
exercise.
There is not space to discuss here in detail the molecular
mechanisms or growing list of health conditions resulting
from the lack of skeletal muscle contractile activity.
However, there is a plethora of publications explaining
the role of physical activity on dozens of conditions.
The early bed-rest studies certainly set the expectation
for rapid deterioration in cardiovascular health, for
muscular atrophy and for other aspects of impaired
human performance. From the whole continuum of
evidence, from the controlled cause-and-effect studies
in rodents focused on how inactivity physiologically
impacts health-related proteins regulating metabolism
up to the epidemiological observations about routine
sedentary behaviours of the human lifestyle such as
watching television, one can most definitely conclude
that good health requires a high frequency and duration
of daily contractile activity. It is important to keep
in mind that this is a young field and the list of
conditions negatively impacted by sedentary behaviour
may still be growing. This list could include obesity,
metabolic syndrome risk factors, diabetes, fatty liver
disease, cardiac health, peripheral artery disease, deep
vein thrombosis, some cancers, inflammation, muscle
atrophy, mood and multiple cognitive changes. Some of
our most prevalent, costly and unsustainable healthcare
problems share common root causes related to inadequate
duration of skeletal muscle contractile activity and are,
thus, potentially preventable by a major shift from living
most of the day with an inactive muscle metabolism
towards a greater reliance on active muscle metabolism.
The key physiological premise
As a result of signals related to skeletal muscle contractile
activity and metabolism, the body is constantly sensing
its internal environment every minute of the day and
responding one way or another to whether or not we are
sedentary or active. Some of the most potent mechanisms
regulating disease susceptibility proteins (such as those for
lipoprotein metabolism and mitochondrial function) are
regulated by inactivity (generally when sitting) because
the body needs frequent muscular activity throughout
the day. In our society, many people are living without the
benefits of enough muscle metabolism for the majority
of the waking day, as evidenced from wearable devices
capturing sedentary time (Spittaels et al. 2012; Loprinzi,
2013; Schuna et al. 2013; Hamilton et al. 2014). Thus,
the ultimate goal is development of a solution involving
long durations of muscular contractile activity frequently
throughout the whole day.
A fundamental concept of muscle physiology is the
specificity principle, which states that the molecular
stimuli and physiological benefits invoked by muscular
activity are specific to the dose and type of activity.
Therefore, it is critical to understand the dose–response
relationships between varying doses and types of human
muscular activity with the bodily response and health
effects. Herein lies one of the driving factors in the
development of the field of inactivity physiology. Over a
decade ago, we started introducing the molecular contra-
sts between ‘inactivity physiology’ vs. ‘exercise physio-
logy’ (Hamilton et al. 2004) and introducing multiple
expressions like ‘sitting too much is not the same
as exercising too little, either behaviourally or physio-
logically’. A specific recommendation based on sound
muscle physiology is crucial, and it must be a safe, effective
solution for all types of people.
A unique goal of inactivity physiology is to improve
health outcomes by greatly increasing levels of physical
activity in all people, even those who cannot or
will not engage in the classical recommendations for
moderate to vigorous physical activity (MVPA). If this
goal is accomplished, the impact can be far reaching.
Development of an effective solution must be based in part
on novel insights about the physiology of how muscular
activity impacts risks caused by prolonged sitting. This
has been extremely challenging since sedentary time has
been a monumental part of life in the modern world.
The holy grail of healthy active living would come from a
breakthrough discovery for how to safely replace most of the
sedentary time with physical activity in everyone, regardless
of age and current health status.
In this article, I provide seven tenets for moving
beyond association studies or basic physiology studies to
integrating human behaviour with easy to understand
physiological principles in order to better understand
a much-needed scientific approach producing safe and
effective active lifestyles.
The seven guiding tenets in the quest for a solution
to the problems caused by sedentary time
The concepts are integrated as part of a paradigm and
to assist the development of research hypotheses and
identification of a worthy solution. The first four tenets
were listed formally in 2007 (Hamilton et al. 2007), in part
described even before that (Hamilton et al. 2004). Tenets
5–7 are summarized here for the first time to guide the
research going forward.
Tenet 1: sedentary time is surprisingly hazardous
to human health in many ways
This was proposed as a hypothesis to encourage more
research to test whether or not high amounts of sitting
time might be a risky behaviour (Hamilton et al. 2004,
2007). At the time, most of the research focus had been on
adding exercise on top of the normal lifestyle. However, we
C

had been noticing remarkably large molecular responses
in pre-clinical animal models during inactivity that were
not evident during exercise. The exposure rate to the risk
of sedentary time is high because people of all ages and
demographics sit or are not moving for a large amount
of time each day (Craft et al. 2012; Levine, 2015; Spittaels
et al. 2012; Loprinzi, 2013; Schuna et al. 2013). To the
extent that this tenet is true and owing to the magnitude
of the effect, the majority of people are in serious need
of a healthy active lifestyle more than previously realized.
One area where this hypothesis has been tested the most
concerns the doubling in the risk for type 2 diabetes and
metabolic syndrome risk factors to sedentary behaviour,
even when adjusting for BMI and MVPA (Edwardson
et al. 2012; Wilmot et al. 2012; Hamilton et al. 2014).
Compounding this problem is the fact that two-thirds
of the entire population is overweight or obese already,
and there is an expanding population of elderly sedentary
people with pre-existing chronic disease. However, one
implication to all of this negative news that we have tried
to emphasize is the flip side to interpreting the same data;
once an effective behavioural solution is discovered, it will
be a genuine novel breakthrough capable of creating an
enormouspositiveimpact.Weandothershavetriedtoalso
explain consistently in scientific articles (Bey et al. 2003;
Hamilton et al. 2004, 2007; Healy et al. 2007; Zderic &
Hamilton, 2012; Hamilton et al. 2014), lectures, and to the
media that because prolonged sedentary time is surprisingly
hazardous to health, logically this must also mean that some
type of high duration and frequent muscular activity capable
of replacing the large amount of sedentary time must also be
surprisingly beneficial for promoting good health.
Tenet 2: sedentary time is a distinct behavioural class
from the time spent engaged in traditional MVPA
recommendations
We found that this is most clearly understood with general
audiences when using the following phrase: ‘too much
sitting’ (actually, contractile inactivity) is not the same as
too little exercise. Exercise in this case is the narrowly
defined type of physical activity recommended by the
current physical activity guidelines. Using more technical
language, this tenet raised the hypothesis that the various
times that people spend sitting inactive or participating
in MVPA-based leisure-time physical activity are distinct
and totally different classes of behaviour, with distinct
determinants and independent effects on risk for disease.
This concept has been studied the most by researchers
in the past decade because it was stated as a hypothesis
suitable for epidemiological studies.
30 min is 1/48th of the day. Adding 30 more minutes
of physical activity 5 days per week, in the form of
MVPA in bouts of at least 10 min, has been widely
recommended. At the behavioural level, observational
association studies (Burton et al. 2012; Craft et al. 2012;
Finni et al. 2014; Kozey-Keadle et al. 2014) using a
variety of measurement techniques have concluded that
even in the individuals who exercise beyond twice the
recommended 150 min week−1, sitting time and the total
daily non-exercise activity were not different from those
who rarely exercised. Considering that 30 min is only
1/48th of the day and people are often sitting for over
70 h week−1, this finding that the amount of MVPA hardly
makes a dent in the massive amount of sedentary time
should not be surprising. Of course, the large amount of
sedentary time in people’s lifestyle displaces an equally
large amount of non-exercise physical activity, and the
associated contractile activity and energy demand for
human movement throughout the day. Even a person
who jogs 20+ miles over �200 min week−1 is also likely
to engage in �15-fold more time doing other physical
activity when not jogging (Craft et al. 2012). Physical
activity is defined by the NIH and WHO and classical
citations (Caspersen et al. 1985) as any bodily movement
produced by the contraction of skeletal muscle that
increases energy expenditure above a basal level at rest.
That definition is so clear and widely used that it does not
need modification. Yet a simple point that is seemingly
lost by many and causing conceptual problems related to
tenet 2 is that physical activity exists on a continuum and
the most abundant type of physical activity is low intensity
physical activity (LIPA). Logically, therefore, inactivity is
the absence of activity, not just the absence of one type
of activity that is less frequent and more intense (MVPA).
The public and scientific progress would be well served to
avoid creating confusion and pseudo-debates not only by
correctly defining sedentary according to the Latin root
(sedere means to sit) as we explicitly first noted a decade
ago (Hamilton et al. 2007), but also by following closer
the historically accepted definition of physical activity.
To understand the large amount of epidemiological and
behavioural research related to tenet 2, it will be helpful
to appreciate the effects of the total time and frequency
of meaningful muscular activity over the course of the
whole day.
Tenet 3: the specificity principle – the molecular
stimuli and physiological benefits invoked by
muscular activity are specific to the dose and type
of activity
This is arguably the most fundamental concept needed
to understand how to best perform muscular activity for
obtaining the desired responses. By linking the specificity
principle with a good understanding of physiology, it is
possible to begin to understand the immediate benefits
of muscular movement throughout the day, as well as the
adaptive responses accumulating over time. This principle
C

is critical for developing high quality studies to determine
dose–responserelationships.Athletictrainingfordifferent
sports has always been based on the knowledge that people
should train specifically for how they compete.
It was not until 2004 that we were in a position
to need to explain this concept within the framework
of a new paradigm. However, already by that time we
had been starting to see that for some key cellular and
molecular factors important for disease risks (Hamilton
et al. 1998; Bey et al. 2001, 2003; Bey & Hamilton, 2003),
it was necessary to distinguish the responses of inactivity
physiology versus classical exercise physiology. And we are
probably still at the early stage for seeing how surprisingly
necessary it is to have a high frequency and high duration
of muscular activity throughout the day in order to
promote optimal regulation of diverse categories of genes
and proteins ranging from lipid regulation by lipoprotein
lipase to genes involved in the regulation of inflammation,
glucose regulation, hemostasis, etc. In the past decade, we
have begun to see from studies using inclinometers that
the average person sits down a little more than 50 times per
day (Craft et al. 2012), while the accelerometry data reveal
that the most natural form of non-exercise walking is in
short spurts at a slow speed (Schuna et al. 2013). By 2007
(Hamilton et al. 2007) and 2014 (Hamilton et al. 2014),
we had begun to describe the logical implications and
how it makes no sense to assume people expect to insert
a bolus of muscular activity from two to four sessions
per week of MVPA-style exercise to gain all of the same
immediateandadaptivebenefitsderivedfromhundredsof
bouts of muscular activity frequently spread throughout
each day.
Interestingly, the most recent federal guidelines for
physical activity currently in the USA removed the
requirement for any specific frequency of physical activity.
In theory, someone can perform 75 min of vigorous
activity on the weekend and meet the recommendation
to be classified as sufficiently physically active. In fact, the
guidelines have always encouraged not breaking up the
activity, and have explicitly required that the MVPA be
performed in bouts lasting longer than 10 min to count. I
speculate that as the field advances, the contrast between
the two sets of recommendations for sedentary behaviour
and MVPA will continue to expand. Given the specificity
principle, this growing contrast is probably a wise and
goodthingforpeoplewhoadheretoboth,becausetheycan
achieve benefits from qualitatively distinct sets of cellular
processes promoting good health.
Deep vein thrombosis (DVT) is an example for under-
standing how this whole day approach to frequent muscular
movement throughout the day may be the most direct
way to prevent a potentially lethal condition (Zderic &
Hamilton, 2012; Howard et al. 2013). Immobilization
of the leg muscles and low rates of muscular blood
flow, including during prolonged sitting, is a cause of
DVT within the veins deep in the leg muscles. Taking
one other specific cellular example, the expression of a
multifunctional gene, LPP1 (lipid phosphate phosphatase
1, which has a documented potential role in countering
haemostasis, cancer and inflammation), in human and
rodentskeletalmuscleisrapidlyreducedbyalargeamount
within the first day of inactivity (Zderic & Hamilton,
2012). And those early preliminary studies provided
evidence to support the hypothesis that LPP1 expression
will remain low throughout about 2 weeks of prolonged
sitting, regardless of whether or not an hour of intense
daily exercise is performed. In summary, the specific
signals harming the body caused by prolonged sitting are
ideally counteracted by abundant activity throughout the
whole day.
One potential na¨
ıve misperception for the public, which
should be easy to counteract if experts are clear about
it, is that eliminating sedentary time is just a stepping
stone to ‘real exercise’ only for people who cannot do
intense MVPA. First of all, elimination of the majority of
the sedentary time in the waking day would raise the total
muscular activity time to a mighty high level. Secondly, if
the non-sedentary activity was even close to approaching
2-fold resting metabolic rate (2 METs), the cumulative
energy expenditure would far exceed the prescriptive levels
of 8 kcal kg−1 week−1 that the MVPA recommendations
are explicitly targeting. At 2 METs (�2 kcal kg−1 h−1), and
a sitting time of �70 h week−1 in healthy adults, there is
an enormous opportunity for raising the total cumulative
energy demand if a feasible means of eliminating a large
amount of sedentary time was to be developed safely for
the sedentary population.
A quantitative summary of the second and third tenets
for general audiences could be illustrated as shown.
From the above discussion, the obvious conclusion is that
exercising 3 times per week to gain 3 h of muscular activity
is far from the perfect antidote for problems caused by
typical amounts of sedentary behaviour, which is commonly
associated with sitting down �350 times per week to
induce �70 h of muscular inactivity. These proportions
are illustrated in Fig. 1. For complete original results, see
Figs 2 and 3 in Craft et al. (2012) and Fig. 4B in (Hamilton
et al. 2014).
What about the intensity of physical activity? First, if
possible people should ideally be encouraged to do both
a small duration and low frequency MVPA (just like the
current guidelines have been doing for years) and a high
duration of lower effort physical activity spread frequently
throughout the whole day. The optimum intensity and
mode for the high duration activity is dependent in
part upon fatigue, feasibility, safety and physiological
effectiveness. This issue is obviously one of the most
distinct reasons why this paradigm is far different from
the classical research focused only on brief amounts of
C

MVPA. Second, there is more than one way to define
intensity. Is it based on the absolute minute by minute
oxygen consumption, the relative metabolic effort of the
individual, the amount of movement captured in an
accelerometer, or most directly to what physical activity is
definedbytheEMGleveloftheworkingmuscle?Andsince
most researchers rely on indirect tools, the public certainly
has trouble with intensity-based recommendations. In
some ways, the long-standing 3 MET threshold for the
border between light and moderate intensity has served
science well. Now there is a growing number of researchers
alsousinga1.5METthresholdforsedentaryandlight.The
dose–responsebetweenhealth-relatedoutcomesandtypes
of activity ranging from complete inactivity (< 1 MET
in most adults) to the �1.5–2.0 MET range has not
received enough research, and desperately warrants more.
The type of standing as when one is standing to work
at a desk is generally less than 1.5 METs, and may be of
marginal cardiometabolic benefit if more movement is
necessary.
Third, the interaction between intensity, frequency
and duration is highly inter-related. The standard in
exercise physiology is to match either the duration or
the total caloric volume when comparing intensity. This
is reasonable, but one has to thoughtfully consider
that in the real world, the amount of time spent in
moderate activity is vastly less than the time at lower
intensity muscular activity. So what does a comparison
of 2 METs vs. 5 METs mean when the daily duration
achieved at 2 METs is more than 10-fold greater than
the higher intensity? The specificity principle (tenet 3)
submits that these are such different stimuli on the
physiological systems of the body that they each may
be of benefit through different molecular pathways. For
example, there are rapid and transient rises in metabolic
rate and blood flow that stimulate fat and carbohydrate
oxidation during the moments a muscle is contracting
(tenet 5). Therefore, it is theoretically possible using this
example that these ‘immediate benefits’ are happening
10 times more often at the lower intensity because
the muscular activity is taking place 10 times more
often. But the higher intensity may also stimulate some
other distinct processes. In this way, the unique benefits
of both ends of the intensity range of activity would
be complementary for rounding out a more complete
health portfolio. We need to avoid ridiculous assertions
that one healthy lifestyle factor (physical activity) can
replace another factor (healthy diet or smoking), when in
reality, distinct categories of behaviour cannot replace one
another.

A, quantitative data for the daily time spent sitting of a typical sedentary person as measured with a device that
measures upright vs sitting time and also the time engaged in ambulation at different intensities. From this, the
cumulative daily time spent sitting was approximately 11.5 h, which was caused by dozens of sitting bouts. B, the
relative volume of time occupied by each sitting bout, the number of daily sitting bouts in a sedentary person,
and the relatively small influence that a bout of recommended MVPA has on either sedentary parameter (bout
number or total sedentary time). The total volume of the square represents the total awake time. The round balls
represent individual sitting bouts that fill up approximately 68% of the waking day. Because these sitting bouts are
spread throughout the entire day and often without consistent patterns due to variations in lifestyles of different
people, the sitting bouts in this graph are not depicted in any order. Instead the panel emphasizes how sedentary
time fills up the waking day in variable ways. The theme when interpreting these data is the realization that there
is an amount of sitting time spread throughout the whole day in various bout lengths and various patterns that
creates an enormous challenge in reducing sedentary time and requires highly focused efforts on this problem.
And, because of the need to specifically eliminate as many sedentary bouts and as much sedentary time as is
safely possible, innovative behavioural strategies will produce results far different from the longstanding MVPA
recommendations.

Reducing sedentary time and promoting universal activity in all people
1337
Tenet 4: in people who do not already exercise, it
logically follows that further increased rates for
disease and mortality cannot be caused by additional
exercise deficiency. The potential benefits of
replacing large and frequent amounts of sedentary
time with safe and achievable physical activity should
be widely discussed, without delay
The shape of the dose–response curve between fitness/
activity and mortality or disease outcomes has long
suggested that the major public health benefits are by
getting the most inactive people to move more rather than
making average people exercise (Hamilton et al. 2004).
And if the ability to effectively replace sedentary time with
a large amount of safe muscular activity is not developed,
the trajectory for growing numbers of sedentary people
with multiple chronic diseases will continue to escalate
in the wrong direction. Technological advances and
other causes promoting sedentary behaviour seem to
continually make growing numbers of people sit more.
Thus, society may not have yet reached the pinnacle of
seeing the full range of poor health caused by the impact
of sedentary time on preventable conditions (such as
type 2 diabetes, cardiovascular disease, obesity, metabolic
syndrome, DVT, fatty liver disease, dementia and some
cancers). Type 2 diabetes is already on an unsustainable
trajectory for management by our healthcare system.
The root cause is in large part the sedentary lifestyles we
choose, with seven studies (see Hamilton et al. (2014)
for a review and discussion) showing that prolonged TV
watching more than doubles the risk for diabetes (even
after accounting for MVPA and BMI). Thus this tenet
was raised out of dire concern for the possible growing
numbers of people unaware of the potentially insidious
effects of sedentary living. One of the most frequent
questions by public health advocates has been, if daily
sedentary time has been a ubiquitous health hazard, why
are we just learning about it now? A fundamental goal
of good public health research is to identify previously
unrecognized, yet common causes of disease. I have
frequently shown conclusion slides in my talks for general
audiences to make this point, by using the analogy with
smoking and tobacco. The point is, for much too long,
there was also not a dire concern raised for the many
people unaware of health hazards caused by smoking. I
show a picture of the now familiar rectangular warning
label eventually required in advertisements, which states
‘Warning:smokingmaybehazardoustoyourhealth’.Then
Ishowanotherpicturewiththeword‘sitting’toreplacethe
word ‘smoking’. One early print advertisement even shows
a young Ronald Reagan with a large stack of gift wrapped
cartons, while stating, ‘I am sending Chesterfields to all
of my friends. That’s the merriest Christmas any smoker
can have.’ As with smoking, I seriously doubt long-term
randomized controlled trials will be funded to induce
more sedentary time to study hard outcomes. But the
short-term studies are clear already: even a single day of
inactivity is potently unhealthy (Bey et al. 2003; Bey &

Tenet 5: the rapid time course of health-related
responses to physical inactivity/activity is in large
part because of the direct effects caused by muscle
contractile activity throughout the day
Nothing else than contractile inactivity/activity comes
close to having a greater instantaneous effect on variations
in metabolic rate throughout each hour of the day. Skeletal
muscle undergoes greater swings in metabolic rate from
moment to moment than any other tissue type in the
body. As introduced above, the metabolic rate of a muscle
fibre at rest is quite low, but can rise 50- to 100-fold
immediately upon activation. As soon as a muscle starts
contracting, ATP (the cellular energy currency) demand
rises immediately by a large amount. Blood flow and
other support processes can also change at the onset
and cessation of contractile activity in order to support
the energy demand of the working fibres. These factors
help to explain why after experimentally decreasing
normal spontaneous ambulatory contractile activity, my
laboratory found rapid and large changes in lipoprotein
lipase (LPL) activity in tandem with slower extraction
of blood triglyceride locally in oxidative muscle, and
significant decreases in high-density lipoprotein (HDL)
cholesterol (Bey et al. 2003). That is likely to be only
the foreshadowing of many other responses where
LPL may play a role in explaining the phenotypes
caused by sitting inactive or by high amounts of low
effort contractile activity, since low LPL is associated
with several phenotypes important for disease risk.
Experimentally reduced LPL activity in oxidative muscle
caused by acute contractile inactivity was related to
blunted removal of fat from the blood locally by oxidative
muscle and reduced HDL plasma concentration in rats
(Bey et al. 2003). And we also found that LPL in human
skeletal muscle was highly correlated with triglyceride
(r = −0.98) and HDL size (r = +0.90 with) and several
other lipoprotein parameters (Harrison et al. 2012).
Interestingly, intense cycling exercise to fatigue did
not raise skeletal muscle LPL (Harrison et al. 2012). A
decrease in LPL in skeletal muscle of insulin-resistant
humans at risk for diabetes has been mechanistically
linked to reduced signalling for mitochondrial biogenesis
(Morino et al. 2012). Finally, LPL activity in human
plasma causes a potent signalling response to produce
anti-inflammatory responses (Ziouzenkova et al. 2003).
Taken together, there are rapid and functionally important
effects of changes in contractile activity of slow oxidative

muscle (soleus) mediated through LPL activity over the
course of a normal day. In contrast, intense running
did not increase either LPL mRNA or LPL activity in
the rat soleus muscle. However, when rats performed
prolonged slow ambulatory activity for several hours,
there was a large increase in LPL activity in the soleus,
completely reversing the decrease produced by prolonged
contractile inactivity (Bey et al. 2003). An important
hypothesis is that this LPL response is mediating
multiple novel health-related responses, by virtue of
pleiotropic effects of LPL on lipoprotein metabolism,
mitochondrial
function
and
anti-inflammatory
protection.
Even at rest when muscle metabolism is not optimal,
most (�80%) of the insulin-dependent glucose utilization
after eating is determined by muscle metabolism. The
ability of muscle to optimally metabolize glucose (and fat)
is central to many aspects of disease prevention. In theory,
raising the metabolic rate of muscle substantially for many
hours throughout each day (as is best done by contra-
ctile activity), including but not limited to after eating
meals, would be able to optimize the role of muscle in
healthpromotion.Thefirststudytodocumentlargeeffects
on insulin sensitivity caused by sustaining low intensity
contractile activity most of the day instead of prolonged
sitting offered two other surprising twists (Stevens et al.
2011). Given that it was using a single day model, the time
course was too rapid to be explained by body composition,
which offers hope to people seeking an immediate benefit
of insulin sensitivity without weight loss requirements.
Secondly, the acute inactivity physiology effects were
evidentdespitethefactthatmostvolunteerswererelatively
fit and regular exercisers (Stevens et al. 2011), which
provides experimental causal evidence supporting the
hypothesis in the second tenet. Since then there have been
other experimental studies of acute inactivity compared
to light activity spread over the day in a variety of types
of people (Dunstan et al. 2012; Saunders et al. 2012;
Duvivier et al. 2013, 2017; Howard et al. 2013), supporting
the second and fifth tenets. With regards to improved
glucose metabolism during acute intermittent walking
over the postprandial period, Dunstan et al. (2012) found
that walking briskly (a moderate pace that was as fast
as overweight–obese people could walk) was not super-
ior to slower walking when matched for time (and thus
more calories were burned at the higher intensity). One
group found in both healthy controls (Duvivier et al.
2013) and people with diabetes (Duvivier et al. 2017)
that a large duration of low intensity activity spread
throughout the whole day was superior to intense end-
urance cycling that was matched for total energy demand.
However, it should be emphasized that as far as we know,
none of the published proof of principle studies have
yet documented a safe and fatigue-resistant behavioural
approach capable of eliminating a large duration of
sedentary time throughout the day such as what is needed
for claiming victory in a likely public health solution
(tenet 7).
The potent and quick momentary responses to
muscular activity lead to one seminal conclusion as the
science progresses in the future: public health campaigns
should eventually provide people with a rich sense of
‘metabolic awareness’ about the concept that ‘the body
constantly senses and responds to movement vs inactivity’,
in tandem with behavioural strategies promoting the ability
to take full advantage of every opportunity to move more.
And this is likely to be good news for all kinds of people,
because evidence indicates that the immediate benefits
of movement are independent of other more intractable
long-term issues such as weight loss and cardiorespiratory
fitness.
Tenet 6: the role of local contractile activity and
muscle specificity
One of the most useful concepts in muscle physiology is
thatonceamotorneuronisstimulated,theaffectedmuscle
fibres respond with close to an all-or-none type of contra-
ctile phenomenon. Because of this, the force output within
large weight-bearing muscles of the leg are graded mostly
by recruitment of more motor units, not by a graded
intensity within the individual fibres. This fundamental
physiology regarding how the body works when we
move helps us to understand why ‘light’ physical activity
can produce powerful changes in cellular signalling,
metabolism and health outcomes. At the level of the
fibres contributing to low effort activity such as strolling
during indoor walking, the rise in energy demand and fuel
supply to the working muscle cells is far from being a light
stimulus.
Phenotypic diversity between different fibre types means
that all muscles are not created equal, nor do they respond
similarly to physical activity. There is a heterogeneity for
the metabolic proteins, fatigue resistance, and threshold
for activation during graded contractile intensity. In
each of our studies in rats, the local contractile activity
within the slow-twitch oxidative muscle appears to be
most important for explaining the reason for maintaining
a high duration of daily low intensity physical activity
in young adults (Hamilton et al. 1998; Bey et al. 2003;
Hamilton et al. 2014) and with ageing (Bey et al. 2001).
It is not known if this holds true across species, because
the heterogeneity between muscle regions (deep red
oxidative vs. superficial white glycolytic) is more evident
in rats than in humans. However, we hypothesize that the
metabolic responses in relatively fatigue-resistant slow-
twitch oxidative skeletal muscle has a dominant role
in combating the diseases associated with too much
sitting.

Reducing sedentary time and promoting universal activity in all people
1339
Tenet 7: we do not need a band-aid. We do need a
revolutionary breakthrough! For a genuine public
health solution to address the complete problem of
sedentary inactivity, a solution that is potent and
safely attainable by most everyone is needed
Major advances moving forward can occur. But to get
there and see the breakthroughs for what they are, we
need to know what goals we are looking for. The seven
tenets and concepts in this paper hopefully point a way
there. I see three things the experts should be open to
considering for making discoveries needed to find that
solution scientifically, but also to get the buy-in from
the public to adopt a major behaviour change. First, we
cannot trivialize the process by aiming low or wasting
limited resources on descriptive guesses about what to
study without a good understanding of how the body
works from translational insights. For some people, it
seems for some reason that the goal of research has been
to learn how little movement people can do and still get
some benefit (e.g. micro-breaks at the end of the hour).
However, for the person who has recently been diagnosed
with a life-threatening condition or is on the pathway for
losing eyesight or a leg because of diabetes complications,
the more significant question should probably not be how
little they can do to help their situation, but how much
can be done to maximize health.
Second, we need to avoid the confusion in the public
health messaging caused by pseudo-debates appearing too
frequently with the nutritional recommendations. Thus,
we should work cooperatively and embrace solutions that
raiseactivityoveralargeamountofthedayandaresafeand
practical for the whole population, including the elderly,
obese and people with chronic conditions. A challenge of
our time is how to make all types of people become much
more active. This is especially important and challenging
for the people who account for most of the healthcare costs
and need an activity-based solution the most.
Third, the experts and funders cannot be cynical,
just because prior public health failures are many.
History is filled with seismic shifts in the right direction
for public health just when gloom and doom seemed
everywhere. A systematic review of the existing inter-
ventions to reduce sedentary time reported on 51 studies
(Martin et al. 2015), with the meta-analysis showing
only 22 min day−1 reduction of the intervention group.
Humans have inadvertently manufactured an insidious
problem of metabolic inertia that has caused us to live
with a stalled metabolic rate for the past several decades.
Ironically, sedentarism is a type of inertia, which is defined
as ‘a body at rest tends to stay at rest’. But it is absolutely
possible for major scientific breakthroughs to provide
momentum for the solution. And with that momentum,
bodies will be put in motion and tend to stay in motion,
both throughout the waking day and for healthy ageing.
