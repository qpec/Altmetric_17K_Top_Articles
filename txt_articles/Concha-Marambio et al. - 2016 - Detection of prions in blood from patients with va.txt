Abstract
Human prion diseases are infectious and invariably fatal neurodegenerative diseases. They include 
sporadic Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease (sCJD), the most common form, and variant CJD (vCJD), 
which is caused by interspecies transmission of prions from cattle infected by bovine spongiform 
encephalopathy. Development of a biochemical assay for the sensitive, specific, early, and 
noninvasive detection of prions (PrPSc) in the blood of patients affected by prion disease is a top 
medical priority to increase the safety of the blood supply. vCJD has already been transmitted 
from human to human by blood transfusion, and the number of asymptomatic carriers of vCJD in 
the U.K. alone is estimated to be 1 in 2000 people. We used the protein misfolding cyclic 
amplification (PMCA) technique to analyze blood samples from 14 cases of vCJD and 153 
controls, including patients affected by sCJD and other neurodegenerative or neurological 
disorders as well as healthy subjects. Our results showed that PrPSc could be detected with 100% 
sensitivity and specificity in blood samples from vCJD patients. Detection was possible in any of 
the blood fractions analyzed and could be done with as little as a few microliters of sample 
volume. The PrPSc concentration in blood was estimated to be ~0.5 pg/ml. Our findings suggest

INTRODUCTION
Human prion diseases are infectious and invariably fatal neuro-degenerative diseases. They 
include sporadic Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease (sCJD), the most common form, and variant CJD 
(vCJD), which is associated with the consumption of cattle infected with bovine spongiform 
encephalopathy (BSE) (1, 2). Currently, there is not a regulatory-approved assay for 
sensitive, objective, and noninvasive biochemical diagnosis of these diseases. This is a major 
problem for public health, because prion diseases are transmitted iatrogenically from human 
to human and because asymptomatic carriers may far outnumber clinically affected 
individuals (3).
The infectious agent responsible for these diseases, termed prion, appears to be composed 
exclusively of a conformationally altered form (PrPSc) of a naturally occurring protein 
(PrPC), which has the exceptional ability to infect individuals and propagate in the body 
without the need for genetic material (4). PrPSc is not only the main component of the 
infectious agent and the likely culprit of neurodegeneration but also the best surrogate 
marker for the disease. A major challenge for early diagnosis based on PrPSc detection is 
that this marker is present at high levels only in the central nervous system at late stages of 
the disease. However, several lines of evidence indicate that prions are also present in small 
quantities in peripheral tissues and biological fluids, such as lymphoid organs, cerebrospinal 
fluid, and blood (5, 6). Detection of PrPSc in blood is very challenging because little is 
known about its quantity, nature, and distribution in this fluid. On the basis of animal 
infectivity studies, it is estimated that in rodent plasma and buffy coat fractions, there is as 
little as 1 to 10 median lethal dose (LD50) infectious units in 1 ml of whole blood, which 
translates into the equivalent of 10 to 1000 million–fold less than the amount of infectious 
material present in diseased brain tissue (7). Moreover, the high amounts of normal PrPC 
found in blood as well as uncertainty about the biochemical and structural properties of 
blood-derived PrPSc (8–12) make it very difficult to develop a diagnostic test, relying on 
existing biochemical and immunological methods for detecting PrPSc. In the case of CJD, it 
is also imperative that an effective test not only have high sensitivity but also be highly 
specific. Considering that no treatment is available for this disease, it is not ethically 
acceptable to have a test with a high frequency of false positives.
Our strategy to achieve sensitive and specific detection of PrPSc was to use an amplification 
technology that reproduces PrPSc replication in vitro (13). This system is called protein 
misfolding cyclic amplification (PMCA) and consists of cycles of accelerated prion 
replication, combining phases of PrPSc growth with fragmentation of the polymers to 
increase the number of seeding-competent units. The cyclic nature of the system permits 
using as many cycles as required to reach the amplification state needed for the detection of 
PrPSc in a particular sample (13, 14). We have previously reported proof-of-concept 
experiments in which the technology was applied to replicate the misfolded protein from 
diverse species (15). The technology has been automated, leading to a marked increase in

 the efficiency of amplification. In its most current form used for vCJD samples (16), one 
round of 96 PMCA cycles (2 days) results in the ability to detect PrPSc in up to a 100 
million–fold (108) dilution of brain tissue; after two rounds, we reached the highest 
detectability possible for PrPSc, which is about 10 billion–fold (1010) dilution. Moreover, 
our results demonstrated that PMCA is capable of detecting as little as about 26 monomers 
of PrP (17, 18), which, according to recent data on the minimal size of the infectious particle 
(19), would correspond to a single particle of oligomeric infectious PrPSc. These data 
demonstrate that PMCA has a similar power of amplification as polymerase chain reaction 
techniques used to amplify DNA and opens up possibilities for development of an assay for 
the highly sensitive detection of PrPSc. We have demonstrated that after amplification, we 
can detect PrPSc in blood of hamsters experimentally infected with scrapie during both the 
symptomatic (20) and presymptomatic phases of the disease (21), as well as in urine of 
human patients affected by vCJD (16). A recent report showed PrPSc detection by PMCA in 
white blood cells of three patients affected by vCJD (22). Using an ovine PrPC substrate for 
the PMCA reaction, this study showed a limit of detection equivalent to 10−7 brain dilution 
and positive PrPSc detection in three of the four vCJD samples tested, suggesting the 
possibility of the absence of prionemia in certain patients (22).
The major goal of our study was to develop a more sensitive PMCA assay for PrPSc 
detection in vCJD blood samples and then use it to evaluate the presence of prions in blood 
from patients affected by this disease and estimate sensitivity and specificity as well as the 
approximate quantity of PrPSc present in vCJD blood.
RESULTS
To investigate detection of vCJD PrPSc in blood by PMCA, we first performed spiking 
experiments diluting vCJD brain homogenate into healthy whole blood to optimize 
conditions and evaluate the limit of sensitivity. As observed in our previous experiments to 
detect PrPSc in animal blood, human blood inhibited the PMCA reaction (20, 21). For this 
reason, it was necessary to process the blood samples to enrich in PrPSc and remove other 
blood components that interfered with PMCA. The process consisted of a centrifugation in 
the presence of sarkosyl, followed by washing in phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) (Fig. 1). 
The resulting material was subjected to sequential rounds of PMCA using as a substrate 
brain homogenates from transgenic mice expressing human PrP with the Met/Met genotype 
at codon 129 [TgHuPrP(129MM)]. After the first round of PMCA, we detected up to a 10−6 
dilution of vCJD brain homogenate spiked in whole blood (Fig. 2). This level of detection 
was clearly lower than the one observed when vCJD brain homogenate was diluted directly 
in conversion buffer (16), suggesting that despite the cleaning procedure, there was still 
some interference from blood components. After two rounds of PMCA, we detected PrPSc 
up to a 10−9 dilution, and after three rounds, we reached the maximum level of detection, 
equivalent to a 10−10 dilution of the vCJD brain homogenate (Fig. 2).
We then analyzed blood samples from 14 patients suffering from vCJD and compared them 
to samples from people affected by other neurodegenerative (60 samples) or 
nondegenerative neurological disorders (26 samples) and healthy individuals (49 samples) 
(Table 1). Our results showed that most of the vCJD blood samples analyzed were positive

 after two rounds of PMCA, and all were positive after three rounds, whereas none of the 
control samples gave any signal, even after five rounds of PMCA (Fig. 3 and Table 1). These 
data indicated that the PMCA technology had a 100% sensitivity (95% confidence interval, 
76.8 to 100%) and specificity (95% confidence interval, 97.6 to 100%) for detection of 
PrPSc in blood of vCJD patients. To analyze whether detection of PrPSc in blood was 
specific for vCJD compared to other forms of human prion diseases, we studied samples 
from sCJD patients. The results showed that none of the six sCJD whole-blood samples 
tested was positive even after five rounds of PMCA (Fig. 3). These results do not necessarily 
mean that there was no PrPSc in the sCJD blood samples but that with the set of PMCA 
conditions used, it could not be detected. In a spiking experiment where healthy blood 
contained different dilutions of sCJD brain homogenate, there was no detection of PrPSc 
even at the lowest dilutions tested (fig. S1). We are currently optimizing a different set of 
PMCA conditions to efficiently detect sCJD prions.
To analyze the blood fraction that carries PrPSc, we took blood samples from two cases of 
vCJD and separated plasma and white blood cells. PrPSc was detectable in both of these 
fractions after a similar number of amplification cycles (Fig. 4), indicating that the amount 
of prions in plasma and white blood cells was similar. However, we cannot rule out 
substantial differences in the quantity of PrPSc in different blood fractions that were masked 
by the very high efficiency of the assay. Also, PrPSc was detectable in whole blood from a 
patient collected at two different times during symptomatic disease (Fig. 4A, lanes 5 and 6). 
We analyzed similar fractions of sCJD blood, confirming the absence of prion detection in 
the setting used to amplify vCJD prions (Fig. 4B). We also analyzed the molecular typing of 
prions amplified from blood by PMCA (fig. S2). As expected, the material amplified from 
blood had the same type 2B pattern (that is, 19 kDa, enriched in the diglycosylated form) 
displayed by prions from vCJD brain homogenates, in contrast to the type 1 and 2 patterns 
of classical sCJD.
To estimate the minimum volume of blood required for our assay, we tested different 
quantities of whole blood from two different vCJD patients. Our results showed that as little 
as 3.3 or even 0.37 μl of blood was sufficient to readily detect PrPSc in human vCJD blood 
after PMCA amplification (Fig. 5A). The differences in the minimum volume of blood 
needed to detect the signal for the two distinct vCJD samples tested likely reflected the 
dissimilar amounts of prions present in different blood samples. However, we cannot rule 
out that some samples may have different amounts of blood components that interfere with 
the PMCA reaction. Reduction of the volume of material used also avoided the need for a 
precleaning step, because the concentration of PMCA inhibitors present in blood was 
reduced to a level that did not interfere with the reaction. In samples of healthy blood spiked 
with a 10−8 dilution of vCJD brain homogenate, the signal in the second PMCA round was 
higher when the volume of sample was lower (Fig. 5A). Elimination of the precleaning step 
is important for practical and routine use of the technology in blood detection because this 
step is time-consuming and labor-intensive. The small minimum volume of blood needed for 
PrPSc detection together with the known ability of PrPSc to bind to a variety of surfaces (23–
25) led us to hypothesize that just placing a blood sample in the PMCA tube may enable 
enough prions to bind to the tube to allow prion replication in a PMCA reaction. To 
investigate this possibility, 100 μl of whole blood from two different patients affected by

 vCJD, as well as from five healthy controls, and normal blood spiked with a 10−5 and a 10−9 
dilution of vCJD brain homogenate were incubated in PMCA tubes for 1 hour at room 
temperature. Thereafter, the entire volume of the samples was removed, and 100 μl of 
PMCA substrate [10% TgHuPrP(129MM)] was added to the same tube. After serial rounds 
of PMCA, the presence of PrPSc was detected by Western blot after proteinase K digestion. 
The results showed that a PrPSc signal was detected in both vCJD blood samples, as well as 
in the positive controls spiked with vCJD brain homogenate (Fig. 5B). The PMCA rounds 
for detection in vCJD blood samples after binding of the agent to the tubes were the same as 
that when using the standard protocol of centrifugation in detergent. Sample vCJD4 was 
detectable in both cases in round 2, and sample vCJD7 was detectable after three rounds of 
PMCA (compare Figs. 3 and 5B). No signal was detectable in any of the healthy controls. 
These results may enable the implementation of a simpler procedure for PrPSc detection in 
blood, but the robustness of the assay needs to be confirmed by analyzing larger numbers of 
vCJD blood samples.
Finally, to estimate the quantity of PrPSc present in vCJD blood, we used the quantitative 
PMCA technology, which compared the number of cycles required to detect the signal with 
that for blood spiked with known concentrations of PrPSc (18). Our data showed that in 11 
of the 14 vCJD samples analyzed, PrPSc was detectable after two PMCA rounds (Figs. 3 and 
4). By comparison with the spiked samples, we estimated this to be equivalent to the amount 
of PrPSc present in a 10−9 dilution of the brain homogenate, which extrapolated to about 5 × 
10−13 g/ml. This concentration is similar to previous estimations using bioassays that 
indicated that the quantity of prions in blood is on the order of 1 to 10 LD50 per milliliter of 
blood (7). Considering our previous estimation of the concentration of PrPSc excreted in 
urine of vCJD patients (16), we conclude that the concentration of PrPSc in blood is between 
two and three orders of magnitude higher than in urine.
DISCUSSION
So far, 231 cases of vCJD have been reported mostly in the U.K. and France (with 4 cases in 
the United States) (26), and the future of this epidemic remains unknown. Fortunately, the 
spread of classical BSE has been largely controlled, thanks to the implementation of feeding 
restrictions and surveillance (27–29). However, the appearance of atypical and genetic forms 
of BSE is an additional concern because the characteristics of transmission of these new 
forms may be different from that of traditional BSE (30–33). Nevertheless, it is estimated 
that millions of people have been exposed to BSE prions, and it is currently unclear how 
many people may silently carry infectious material. Studies in transgenic mouse models of 
human prion disease showed that infection with BSE prions frequently produces subclinical 
or carrier states, which upon a secondary infection can produce full-blown disease (3, 34, 
35). Strikingly, a recent study searching for PrPSc immunoreactivity in archived surgically 
resected appendix samples in the U.K. estimated that 30,000 people in this country are 
asymptomatic carriers of vCJD infection (36). It is probable that this number is 
underestimated, because the methods used to detect prions in lymphoreticular specimens are 
unlikely to have 100% sensitivity. The possible existence of a large number of carriers of 
vCJD prions represents a significant risk for iatrogenic transmission of vCJD from human to 
human, a pathway that has already been shown to happen in other human prion diseases,

 such as kuru and iatrogenic CJD (37). Iatrogenic transmission of vCJD through blood 
transfusion is a major concern. Unfortunately, this route has already proven to be a problem 
because several cases have been linked to transfusion of blood donated by infected 
individuals in the preclinical stage of the disease (38–40).
Currently, there is no premortem biochemical diagnosis for vCJD or any validated procedure 
to detect prions in blood or other human-derived tissues that might represent a concern for 
iatrogenic transmission of vCJD. People affected by vCJD die, on average, 2 years after the 
first clinical signs appear. The disease normally starts with psychiatric alterations 
(depression, anxiety, and hallucinations), which are common in other diseases, and only 
begins to show more typical signs of a neurodegenerative condition (ataxia, myoclonus, and 
dementia) several months after the first symptoms have occurred. Even then, the diagnosis of 
vCJD is uncertain and is only confirmed by postmortem examination of the brain for the 
presence of prions with the vCJD signature. A definitive diagnosis of vCJD in the early 
stages of clinical disease will be crucial for differential diagnosis from other neurological 
disorders that share similar clinical abnormalities. Furthermore, early diagnosis of vCJD 
would allow any potential therapy to be given before substantial brain damage has occurred. 
It would also allow any public health measures to be implemented rapidly, for example, 
tracing recipients of blood donated by individuals with vCJD.
Sensitive detection of prions in biological fluids has been reported using prion amplification 
techniques, including PMCA and RT-QuIC (real-time quaking-induced conversion) (41, 42). 
Both PMCA and RT-QuIC take advantage of the seeding of protein misfolding by prions to 
substantially amplify the signal and detect small amounts of PrPSc. Detection of PrPSc by 
RT-QuIC in cerebrospinal fluid (43, 44) and nasal mucosa (45) is currently being used in the 
clinical diagnosis of sCJD. There has been less work on the application of RT-QuIC to vCJD 
samples, and this technology appears less efficient for blood samples. Our current study 
demonstrates that small quantities of PrPSc were present in the blood (both in plasma and 
associated with white cells) of the 14 vCJD patients analyzed. PrPSc was detectable by 
PMCA with 100% sensitivity and specificity. Similar results are reported by Bougard et al. 
in this issue using PMCA after capturing PrPSc from blood using plasminogen-coated beads 
(46). Strikingly, Bougard et al. also showed positive detection of PrPSc in two blood samples 
taken at the preclinical stage of the disease from donors that years later developed vCJD. 
Although both our study and that by Bougard et al. show 100% sensitivity and specificity, it 
is important to highlight the caveat that these estimations are based on a very small number 
of vCJD blood samples (14 cases in our study and 18 cases in the study by Bougard et al.). 
Future double-blind studies are needed with a larger number of blood samples to allow 
statistical validation of this assay. In addition to the small number of samples analyzed, other 
limitations of our study include the fact that all samples came from individuals at later stages 
of clinical disease and blood samples from presymptomatic cases were not analyzed. Finally, 
it is important to highlight that because PMCA can detect subinfectious amounts of prions, a 
positive signal by PMCA does not necessarily indicate that the carrier will eventually 
develop the clinical disease.
There is evidence that at least four cases of vCJD were acquired by transfusion with blood 
taken from donors at the preclinical stage of the disease (38–40). Given that PMCA can

 detect the equivalent of a single particle of PrPSc (17, 18), our findings suggest that PMCA 
may be useful for noninvasive diagnosis of this disease in presymptomatic individuals, 
although this possibility needs to be tested. We have previously shown preclinical detection 
of prions in blood samples from animals experimentally infected with prion diseases (21). 
Further studies are needed to demonstrate the usefulness of PMCA for presymptomatic 
detection of vCJD prions in biological fluids and to investigate the earliest time point during 
the preclinical phase of vCJD at which PrPSc can be detected in blood.
MATERIALS AND METHODS
Study design
We analyzed blood samples from 14 vCJD patients and 137 controls (either healthy or with 
different neurological or neurodegenerative disorders). We also analyzed 16 samples from 
individuals affected by sCJD. Samples were obtained randomly without any exclusion or 
inclusion criteria other than the respective clinical diagnosis. Data reported included all 
samples analyzed. No samples or data were excluded after analysis. Although this study was 
not done with blinded samples, we analyzed vCJD samples and controls at random from 
initial centrifugation until Western blot. The identity of the samples was seen only after the 
results were obtained.
Patient samples
Samples of frozen whole blood were collected at different stages of clinical vCJD from 14 
different patients. Twelve of the samples were collected in the U.K., and two were collected 
in Italy. The disease was confirmed postmortem by neuropathological and biochemical 
analyses. As controls, we used four groups of whole-blood samples, including 62 patients 
affected by other neurodegenerative diseases (Alzheimer’s disease, Parkinson’s disease, 
frontotemporal dementia, and Lewy body dementia), 26 patients affected by 
nondegenerative neurological disorders (vascular dementia, traumatic brain injury, stroke, 
epilepsy, encephalitis, and mood disorders), and 49 healthy individuals (Table 1). 
Additionally, we analyzed five samples of plasma and five samples of white blood cells from 
sCJD patients as well as six whole-blood samples. The diagnosis of sCJD was also 
confirmed postmortem by Western blot and neuropathological analysis, whereas the 
diagnosis of other neurological diseases was determined clinically with the help of imaging 
and biochemical assays when available. Blood collection was approved by the respective 
institutional review boards at the authors’ institutions.
Processing of blood samples
Samples of whole blood, and in some cases separated plasma or white blood cell fractions, 
were processed as previously described to remove the bulk of proteins and other components 
that interfered with the PMCA reaction (Fig. 1). Briefly, 250 μl of a sample was mixed and 
incubated with 1 volume of 20% sarkosyl for 10 min at room temperature. Thereafter, 
samples were centrifuged at 100,000g for 1 hour at 4°C, the supernatant was discarded, and 
the pellet was washed in 500 μl of PBS. Tubes were centrifuged again at 100,000g for 30 
min at 4°C. The pellet was resuspended directly in 10% brain homogenate from

 TgHuPrP(129MM) transgenic mice, supplemented with 0.05% digitonin and 12 mM EDTA 
(see below).
PMCA procedure
The PMCA reaction was carried out as previously described (16, 47) using as a substrate 
brain homogenate from transgenic mice expressing human PrP with Met/Met genotype at 
position 129 [TgHuPrP(129MM)]. Brain substrate was prepared at a concentration of 10% 
(w/v) in conversion buffer (PBS supplemented with 150 mM NaCl and 1% Triton X-100) 
with protease inhibitors (cOmplete, EDTA-free; Roche). Debris was removed by a low-
speed centrifugation (800g, 1 min, 4°C), and brain homogenates were stored frozen at 
−80°C until further use.
For PMCA, samples were subjected to a first round of 144 cycles of PMCA in 0.2-ml tubes 
(Eppendorf, catalog no. 951010022) containing three PTFE beads (Hoover Precision 
Products). Each cycle consisted of 29 min and 30 s of incubation at 37/40°C, followed by a 
30-s pulse of sonication set at an amplitude of 30, using the Qsonica micro-plate horn 
sonicator (Model Q700) equipped with a titanium horn. Subsequent rounds of 96 PMCA 
cycles were performed by taking an aliquot of the amplified material that was diluted 10-
fold into fresh TgHuPrP129MM brain homogenate. No multichannel pipettes were used to 
reduce the risk of cross-contamination. After PMCA, samples were taken for detection of 
PrPSc using Western blot after digestion with proteinase K (50 μg/ml) for 1 hour at 37°C (16, 
47).

 Fig. 1. Schematic representation of the processing of blood samples and the PMCA procedure
To remove inhibitors of the PMCA reaction, samples of whole blood (or separated blood 
components) were incubated with 1 volume of 20% sarkosyl. After centrifugation, the pellet 
was washed in PBS and centrifuged again. The new pellet was resuspended directly in 10% 
brain homogenate (BH) from TgHuPrP(129MM) transgenic mice and was placed in a 0.2-ml 
tube with three polytetrafluoroethylene (PTFE) beads. Samples were subjected to a first 
round of 144 PMCA cycles, followed by subsequent rounds of 96 PMCA cycles. The PrPSc 
signal was detected by Western blotting after proteinase K digestion. SDS-PAGE, SDS–
polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis.

 Fig. 2. Optimization and limit of detection of vCJD PrPSc in blood
To optimize PrPSc detection by PMCA and determine the limit of detection, whole blood 
from a healthy person was spiked with vCJD brain homogenate at different dilutions (10−4 
to 10−11). After processing by centrifugation in the presence of sarkosyl (as described in Fig. 
1), samples were subjected to various rounds of PMCA (the first round consisted of 144 
cycles, and subsequent rounds consisted of 96 cycles). The PrPSc signal was assessed by 
Western blot analysis after proteinase K digestion. N refers to the normal (healthy) brain 
homogenate used as a migration control marker. Numbers on the left indicate the position of 
molecular weight markers.

 Fig. 4. Detection of PrPSc in different blood fractions and at different times during clinical 
disease
(A) Samples of whole blood, plasma, and white blood cells (WBCs) from two patients (#13 
and #14) affected by vCJD and one healthy control were analyzed for the presence of PrPSc 
in different blood fractions. In addition, whole blood from one patient was collected and 
tested at two different time points during the clinical phase of the disease. Samples were 
processed and subjected to four rounds of PMCA (first round consisted of 144 cycles and 
subsequent rounds of 96 cycles). Lane 1, vCJD patient #13 plasma; lane 2, vCJD patient #14 
plasma; lane 3, vCJD patient #14 WBC; lane 4, healthy control plasma; lane 5, vCJD patient 
#13 whole blood “a” (collected on September 2002); lane 6, vCJD patient #13 whole blood 
“b” (collected on November 2002); lane 7, healthy control WBC; lane 8, healthy control 
whole blood; lane 9, molecular weight standard (MW). N refers to normal brain homogenate 
from TgHuPrP(129MM) transgenic mice without proteinase K treatment, which was used as 
a migration control. Numbers on the left indicate the position of molecular weight markers. 
(B) Samples of plasma or WBCs from 10 different patients affected by sCJD were tested 
under the same conditions as in (A). All samples were negative after five sequential rounds 
of PMCA.

 Fig. 5. Detection of PrPSc in small volumes of blood
(A) To estimate the minimum volume of whole blood needed for PrPSc detection, different 
volumes of whole blood from two vCJD patients (samples #4 and #6) were directly added to 
a 10% brain homogenate from TgHuPrP(129MM) transgenic mice. We used blood from a 
healthy individual spiked with a 10−8 dilution of vCJD brain homogenate as a positive 
control. Samples were subjected to three sequential rounds of PMCA, and PrPSc was 
detected by Western blot. (B) Samples of whole blood (100 μl) from two vCJD patients (#4 
and #7) and five healthy controls and two blood samples from controls spiked with 10−5 or 
10−9 dilutions of vCJD brain homogenate were incubated with PMCA tubes containing three 
PTFE beads for 1 hour at room temperature in an end-over-end mixer. The blood samples 
were removed, and 100 μl of PMCA substrate was added to the tube. Samples were 
subjected to various rounds of PMCA (first round of 144 cycles and subsequent rounds of 96 
cycles), and PrPSc was detected by Western blot after proteinase K digestion. In both panels, 
N refers to normal brain homogenate from TgHuPrP(129MM) transgenic mice without 
proteinase K treatment, which was used as a migration control. Numbers on the left indicate 
the position of molecular weight markers.
