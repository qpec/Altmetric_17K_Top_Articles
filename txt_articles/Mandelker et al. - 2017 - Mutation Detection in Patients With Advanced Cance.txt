 Abstract
IMPORTANCE—Guidelines for cancer genetic testing based on family history may miss 
clinically actionable genetic changes with established implications for cancer screening or 
prevention.
OBJECTIVE—To determine the proportion and potential clinical implications of inherited 
variants detected using simultaneous sequencing of the tumor and normal tissue (“tumor-normal 
sequencing”) compared with genetic test results based on current guidelines.
DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS—From January 2014 until May 2016 at Memorial 
Sloan Kettering Cancer Center, 10 336 patients consented to tumor DNA sequencing. Since May 
2015, 1040 of these patients with advanced cancer were referred by their oncologists for germline 
analysis of 76 cancer predisposition genes. Patients with clinically actionable inherited mutations 
whose genetic test results would not have been predicted by published decision rules were 
identified. Follow-up for potential clinical implications of mutation detection was through May 
2017.
EXPOSURE—Tumor and germline sequencing compared with the predicted yield of targeted 
germline sequencing based on clinical guidelines.
MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES—Proportion of clinically actionable germline 
mutations detected by universal tumor-normal sequencing that would not have been detected by 
guideline-directed testing.
RESULTS—Of 1040 patients, the median age was 58 years (interquartile range, 50.5–66 years), 
65.3% were male, and 81.3% had stage IV disease at the time of genomic analysis, with prostate, 
renal, pancreatic, breast, and colon cancer as the most common diagnoses. Of the 1040 patients, 
182 (17.5%; 95%CI, 15.3%–19.9%) had clinically actionable mutations conferring cancer 
susceptibility, including 149 with moderate- to high-penetrance mutations; 101 patients tested 
(9.7%; 95%CI, 8.1%–11.7%) would not have had these mutations detected using clinical 
guidelines, including 65 with moderate- to high-penetrance mutations. Frequency of inherited 
mutations was related to case mix, stage, and founder mutations. Germline findings led to 
discussion or initiation of change to targeted therapy in 38 patients tested (3.7%) and predictive 
testing in the families of 13 individuals (1.3%), including 6 for whom genetic evaluation would not 
have been initiated by guideline-based testing.
CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE—In this referral population with selected advanced 
cancers, universal sequencing of a broad panel of cancer-related genes in paired germline and 
tumor DNA samples was associated with increased detection of individuals with potentially 
clinically significant heritable mutations over the predicted yield of targeted germline testing based 
on current clinical guidelines. Knowledge of these additional mutations can help guide therapeutic 
and preventive interventions, but whether all of these interventions would improve outcomes for 
patients with cancer or their family members requires further study.
TRIAL REGISTRATION—clinicaltrials.gov Identifier: NCT01775072
In addition to guiding therapy, simultaneous DNA sequence analysis of tumor-normal pairs 
(“tumor-normal sequencing”) reveals inherited cancer predisposition mutations in 3% to 
12.6% of pediatric and adult patients with cancer.1–7 It remains unknown, however, how

 many inherited mutations would be detected by multigene tumor-normal analysis compared 
with a traditional family history–based approach to genetic counseling and testing, and what 
the clinical implications of these findings would be. Selection for genetic testing is 
traditionally based on pathologic features of the tumor, age at diagnosis, family history of 
cancer, and other factors represented in clinical practice guidelines.8–10 Studies have not 
determined whether inherited mutations found by tumor-normal sequencing would have 
been detected by traditional approaches to selection for genetic testing.1–5
This study presents the results of analyses of inherited (“germline”) DNA performed in a 
prospective analysis of patients with advanced cancer tested by a targeted tumor-normal 
sequencing panel as previously described.11,12 The goals of the study were to determine the 
incremental proportion of clinically actionable mutations detected by concurrent germline 
analysis in patients with cancer undergoing universal tumor profiling compared with 
selective germline testing based on existing practice guidelines and to assess the association 
of identified mutations with therapeutic management and targeted cancer prevention in 
family members.
Methods
Patient Cohort
The cohort comprised patients with advanced cancer at Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer 
Center undergoing tumor and normal DNA sequencing using MSK-IMPACT (Memorial 
Sloan Kettering-Integrated Mutation Profiling of Actionable Cancer Targets), a 410-gene 
panel.1,11,12 From May 2015, in the context of an institutional review board–approved 
protocol, patients with selected tumor types were prospectively offered secondary germline 
analysis after consenting to tumor genetic analysis. Germline analysis included 76 genes on 
the MSK-IMPACT panel associated with hereditary cancer predisposition, including all 
cancer-predisposing genes identified in the American College of Medical Genetics and 
Genomics guidelines.13–15 Nine mutation carriers were included in a prior study,1 and 23 
and 51 mutation carriers were included in recent series of prostate cancer,16,17 although 
clinical annotation including family history and treatment information was not available for 
those articles.
Ascertainment, Consent, Sequencing, Variant Calling, and Results Reporting
Through their physicians, patients were offered participation in a research study, using a 
video consent aid explaining risks and benefits of testing for inherited mutations (germline 
testing). Eligibility was restricted to those who also consented to tumor sequencing, with 
emphasis on patients with advanced (stage III-IV) disease; however, physicians had 
discretion for patient referral. Genetic testing reports were issued to the medical record, and 
individuals with pathogenic or likely pathogenic variants (henceforth referred to as 
“pathogenic variants”) were invited for genetic counseling where at-risk family members 
were identified (eAppendix 1 in Supplement 1). Tumor DNA and nontumor DNA were 
sequenced and variants were reported as described previously11 (eAppendix 2 in the 
Supplement 1). Variants were interpreted based on American College of Medical Genetics 
and Genomics criteria18 by a clinical molecular geneticist or molecular pathologist; variants

 of unknown significance (eTable in Supplement 2) were not included in clinical reports. 
Loss of heterozygosity (LOH), defined as loss of the normal allele in the tumor at the locus 
of the inherited mutation, was assessed by the FACETS algorithm as published previously19; 
hypermutated status was defined as 20 or more mutations; and microsatellite instability high 
(MSI-H) was defined as more than 10% of loci on the MSK-IMPACT panel demonstrating 
microsatellite instability.20
In this study, not all pathogenic mutations (associated with disease causation) were 
considered clinically actionable. Clinical actionability of pathogenic variants was defined by 
evidence for their utility in cancer prevention (eAppendix 3 in Supplement 1) and/or 
potential utility as therapeutic targets. For this study, all germline mutations of established 
low, moderate, or high risk (penetrance) were considered clinically actionable8–10,16,21,22 
(eTable 1 in Supplement 1). Mutations were classified as having high penetrance (relative 
risk >4), moderate penetrance (relative risk 2–4), or low penetrance (relative risk <2) as well 
as being recessive or of uncertain clinical actionability based on known disease-associated 
risks and current modeling.8–10,16,21
Comparison of Conventional Family History–Based and Agnostic Testing for Cancer 
Predisposition Syndromes
Detailed clinical annotation, including self-reported religion and race, was abstracted for 
each patient record. Religion and race information was collected to analyze genetic effects 
of population stratification. Ashkenazi ancestry was determined by self-report of religious 
preference, via a list of choices, at the time of registration or by specific report of Eastern 
European Jewish background of relatives at the time of genetic counseling. Race was self-
reported by fixed categories at the time of registration. Three-generation family history 
information was assessed at the time of results communication or from records at the time of 
genetic testing. Published guidelines and syndrome-specific genetic testing 
algorithms8–10,23–25 were used to determine which genetic tests would be indicated based on 
tumor histologic features, bilaterality, multiple metachronous cancers, age at onset of cancer, 
family history of cancer (including age at which relatives were affected), and self-reported 
Ashkenazi ancestry. Where indicated, multigene panels (eTable 2 in Supplement 1) were 
considered standard of care and were applied using decision rules based on published 
guidelines (eAppendix 4 in Supplement 1). A pathogenic variant in secondary analysis was 
considered incremental if it would not have been detected by testing that would have been 
ordered based on application of these decision rules, with additional decision rules for cases 
harboring 2 variants (eAppendix 5 in Supplement 1).
Adjustment for Founder Mutations and DNA Repair Genes
To adjust for effects of founder mutations, a set of Ashkenazi and European founder 
mutations in BRCA1/2, APC, MSH2, MSH6, CHEK2, or MUTYH were included in the 
overall analysis but also identified so as to allow subset analysis (eBox in Supplement 1).
Mutations in ATM, BAP1, BARD1, BRCA1/2, BRIP1, CHEK2, FAM175A, MLH1, MSH2, 
MSH6, NBN, PALB2, PMS2, and RAD51D recently associated with advanced prostate

 cancer16 were coded for separate analysis of patients with advanced prostate cancer, and to 
assess patients potentially amenable to targeted therapies.
Statistical Analysis
Variant frequencies in cases were compared with allele frequencies in noncancer controls 
from public databases and stratified by European and Ashkenazi subsets.26–30 Allele 
frequencies were compared by Fisher exact 2-sided binomial test in R version 3.3 software 
(R Foundation) using RStudio version 0.99.903 (RStudio). To estimate findings resulting 
from a different case mix, tumor type–specific rates of pathogenic variants were multiplied 
by cancer rates in the general population31 as well as rates of discordant variants observed in 
a separate ascertainment1 (eAppendix 6 in Supplement 1). Where proportions are presented, 
95% confidence intervals were derived. Clinical variables were compared with regard to 
genetically defined subsets, mutational load as measured by number of somatic mutations, 
and time from diagnosis to tumor-normal analysis for metastatic disease, using 2-sample t 
test for independent samples, with 2-tailed P values significant at P < .05. Rates of 
incremental findings were compared between subsets by Fisher exact test, and proportions 
of germline findings were compared by stage of disease using χ2 test.
Results
Cohort Characteristics
As part of an institutional review board–approved protocol, from January 1, 2014, until May 
31, 2016, 10 336 patients consented to genetic analysis of their tumors. The distribution of 
cancer diagnoses, sex, age, and stage of disease in the 1040 patients who consented to 
secondary germline testing from May 1, 2015, through May 31, 2016, is shown in Table 1. 
Of the 1040 patients, 65.3% were male and 34.7% female. The median age of those who 
consented to genetic analysis of their tumors was 58 years (interquartile range [IQR], 47–67 
years), and the median age of those who consented to secondary germline testing was 58 
years (IQR, 50.5–66 years). The median age was similar for all tumor subsets except 
prostate cancer, for which patients consenting to germline analysis were slightly younger 
than those who underwent tumor variant calling only (median age, 61 [IQR, 55–67] vs 63 
[IQR, 56–68] years, respectively; P = .04). Of the 1040 patients, the proportions with stage 
0, I, II, III, and IV disease at the time of genomic analysis were 0.3%, 3.3%, 7.9%, 7.2%, 
and 81.3%, respectively. Self-identification of Jewish ancestry was more common in those 
consenting to secondary germline analysis than in those undergoing tumor variant calling 
only (26.9% vs 18.1%, respectively).
Variants Detected
Of the 1040 patients undergoing secondary germline analysis, 205 patients (19.7%) harbored 
pathogenic variants conferring cancer predisposition. Of the 205 patients with pathogenic 
variants, 182 carried clinically actionable mutations of high (n = 97), moderate (n = 52), or 
low (n = 33) penetrance, 8 were carriers of variants associated with recessive syndromes, 
and 15 carried variants in genes of unproven clinical actionability. Table 2 shows the 
distribution of 220 variants in these 205 patients, listed by penetrance class and by tumor 
type. For tumor types with more than 10 cases tested, the incidence of patients with inherited

 pathogenic variants ranged from 56.3% (9 of 16 patients) for bladder cancers (including 
urothelial carcinomas) to 25.0% (44 of 176 patients) for pancreatic cancer, 19.6% (71 of 362 
patients) for prostate cancer, 16.4% (23 of 140 patients) for renal cancer, and 9.2% (8 of 65 
patients) for colon cancer. Each patient had an average of 1.8 variants of uncertain 
significance in the 76 genes tested, with 833 of 1040 patients (80%) having at least 1 variant 
of uncertain significance (eTable in Supplement 2). Of the 1040 patients, 15 had more than 1 
variant (eTable in Supplement 3).
Pathogenic variants of genes involved in DNA repair pathways16 were observed in 49 of 362 
patients (13.5%) with prostate cancer, all of whom had advanced disease, but also in 87 of 
678 patients (12.8%) with cancers other than prostate cancer. Of the 220 mutations detected 
in 205 patients, 83 mutations (37.7%; in 79 patients) were known founder mutations 
(including Ashkenazi founder mutations, and European founder mutations in MUTYH and 
the CHEK2 c.1100delC). Cases with founder mutations represented 75.8% of low-
penetrance, 40.4% of moderate-penetrance, and 34% of high-penetrance pathogenic alleles 
(eTable 3 in Supplement 1).
Comparisons With Phenotype-Directed Approaches
A total of 101 cases had incremental clinically actionable findings that would not have been 
detected by phenotype-directed testing using current clinical criteria, representing 
9.7%(95%CI, 8.1%–11.7%) of the 1040 cases overall and 55.5% (95% CI, 48.2%–62.5%) of 
the 182 patients with clinically actionable mutations (Figure). Had the case mix conformed 
to population cancer incidence rates,31 the 55.5% proportion of incremental findings would 
have been 49.1%. Of the 101 patients with incremental clinically actionable findings, 27, 38, 
and 36 patients carried high-, moderate-, or low-penetrance mutations, respectively (eTable 4 
in Supplement 1). Thus, of the 101 incremental findings, 65 were moderate- or high-
penetrance mutations. There was no difference in the proportion of patients with incremental 
findings in the 85.2% of probands with family history assessed by genetic counselors or the 
14.8% assessed from physician records.
Had all individuals been screened for population-specific founder mutations in addition to 
guideline-directed testing, the proportion of incremental clinically actionable findings would 
have declined to 57 of 182 patients (31.3%; 95%CI, 25.0%–38.4%). Had patients with 
prostate cancer also been screened with a panel of DNA repair genes, the resulting 
proportion of findings considered incremental would be 35 of 182 patients (19.2%; 95%CI, 
14.2%–25.6%) or 3.4%(95%CI, 2.4%–4.7%) of the 1040 cases overall (eTable 4 in 
Supplement 1). The highest proportion of actionable findings that would not have been 
detected based on clinical guidelines were observed in biliary, prostate, colorectal, renal, and 
pancreatic tumors (eTable 4 in Supplement 1). Table 3 shows all cases with incremental 
actionable findings, excluding known founder mutations, which would not have been 
detected using guideline directed approaches for high-penetrance mutations (BRCA2, 
CDKN2A, PALB2, VHL, SDHA, MSH2, MSH6, and BAP1), moderate-penetrance 
mutations (CHEK2, ATM, MITF, BRIP1, and RAD51D), and low-penetrance mutations 
(APC, MUTYH). Twenty-two percent of germline BRCA1/2 mutations (13 of 59 mutations) 
and 42.8% of mismatch repair gene mutations (6 of 14 mutations), including founder

 mutations, were seen in patients who would not have been referred for testing using existing 
guidelines.
Clinical Implications of Results Transmitted
At a median time to transmission of results to patients after testing of 1 month (range, 0–16 
months), as of May 2017, germline results have been communicated to 193 of 205 patients 
(94.1%) with pathogenic variants detected and 175 of 182 patients (96.2%) with clinically 
actionable findings. For 29 patients (probands) found to have actionable mutations, genetic 
testing had been offered to relatives; for 13 of these families, the index patient’s genetic 
findings would not have been discovered through guideline-based genetic evaluation. In half 
(15 of 29) of the families tested, the mutation has been detected in at least 1 relative; for 20 
relatives with mutations, increased surveillance or risk-reducing surgical procedures have 
been recommended, with oophorectomy documented in a daughter of a proband with 
advanced prostate cancer. Of the 182 probands with actionable findings, 132 had mutations 
in DNA repair genes, resulting in discussion or initiation of a change to US Food and Drug 
Administration–approved or off-label use of targeted therapy in 38 patients. Of these 38 
patients, 11 received treatment with poly adenosine diphosphate–ribose polymerase (PARP) 
inhibitors and/or platinum-based chemotherapy as of May 2017, and such treatments were 
discussed or in planning in the remaining 27 patients (Table 4 and eTable 5 in Supplement 
1). In an additional patient in his mid-60s with advanced prostate cancer with more than 20 
somatic mutations and a PMS2 germline mutation, immunotherapy was planned but not yet 
administered. Of the subset of 101 cases with actionable findings not predicted by 
phenotype, 59 involved DNA repair genes. This resulted in discussion or initiation of 
targeted therapy in 17 patients, with targeted treatment being administered in 6 of these 17 
individuals (Table 4 and eTable 5 in Supplement 1).
Comparison of Incremental Findings by Stage of Disease
Among 194 stage 0 to III cases, 16 (8.3%; 95%CI, 5.1%–13.0%) had likely pathogenic 
germline variants, compared with 189 of 846 patients (22.3%; 95%CI, 19.7%–25.3%) with 
stage IV disease (P < .001). Among 166 clinically actionable pathogenic variants in stage IV 
cases, 93 (56.0%; 95% CI, 48.4%–63.4%) were incremental, compared with 8 of 16 
incremental actionable variants (50.0%; 95% CI, 28.0%–72.0%) among patients with stage 0 
to III disease (P = .64). This analysis yielded similar results by all tumor types except colon 
cancer, in which Lynch mutations were more common in patients with earlier stage disease 
(eTable 6 in Supplement 1). The median number of tumor (somatic) mutations was 4 (IQR, 
2–6) in 205 cases with pathogenic variants and 3 (IQR, 2–5) in 835 cases without pathogenic 
variants (P = .31), with a median of 3 mutations observed in both stage 0 through III disease 
(IQR, 1–5) and stage IV disease (IQR, 2–6) (P = .07). The median time from diagnosis to 
tumor-normal testing for metastatic disease was 2 years for both the 181 patients with 
pathogenic variants (IQR, 1–6 years) and the 648 patients without such variants (IQR, 1–5 
years) (P = .91).
Analysis of Cohorts of Ashkenazi and Non-Ashkenazi Background

 population-specific founder mutations, 5 of 68 patients (7.4%; 95% CI, 3.2%–16.1%) of 
Ashkenazi ancestry with clinically actionable variants would have had incremental findings 
not predicted by phenotype or ancestry, compared with 46 of 124 patients (37.1%;95%CI, 
29.1%–45.9%) who were not of Ashkenazi ancestry (P < .001) (eTable 7 in Supplement 1).
Comparisons With Public Databases
Among patients of non-Ashkenazi ancestry, a set of CHEK2 mutations, predicted by family 
history in only a single patient, was over represented in prostate and pancreatic cancers 
compared with controls from the Exome Aggregation Consortium.26,27 MUTYH mutations 
were enriched in non-Ashkenazi patients with prostate cancer and not predicted by family 
history. Among patients of Ashkenazi ancestry, there was enrichment for CHEK2 mutations 
in patients with pancreatic cancer, compared with a public database of 2177 controls of 
Ashkenazi ancestry30 (eTable 8 in Supplement 1).
Tumor-Germline Correlations
In the 205 patients with a pathogenic variant, 93 of 170 tumors (54.7%) showed LOH or a 
pathogenic somatic second mutation in the same gene as the pathogenic variant. Of 180 
evaluable pathogenic variants in 170 tumors, 82 variants showed LOH in the tumors and 13 
tumors demonstrated a loss-of-function mutation or a previously reported deleterious 
missense variant.32,33 Concurrent somatic LOH or a second mutation at the same locus 
accompanied the germline mutation in 37 of 48 evaluable tumors (77.1%) in patients with 
BRCA1/2 germline mutations, 9 of 12 patients (75.0%) with mismatch repair gene variants, 
and 13 of 36 patients (36.1%) with germline CHEK2 variants, including 5 of 10 patients 
(50.0%) with the founder CHEK2 c.1100delC variant. Of the 103 pathogenic BRCA 
mutations identified in the tumors of the 1040 patients in this study, only 59 were germline 
in origin, whereas 44 were detected in the tumor.
A hypermutated tumor profile (defined as >20 somatic mutations) or MSI-H (defined as 
>10% of loci by MSIsensor20) was observed in 51 of 1040 patients (4.9%). Germline 
pathogenic variants in mismatch repair genes were identified in 12 of these 51 patients 
(23.5%). Two additional patients with germline MSH6 truncating mutations had tumors that 
were not hypermutated or MSI-H by MSI-sensor (1 with renal cell cancer and 1 with 
prostate cancer). Among the hypermutated or MSI-H cases, 14 of 51 (27.5%) fulfilled 
clinical criteria for Lynch syndrome (revised Bethesda guidelines and/or Amsterdam II 
criteria); 6 of 12 patients (50.0%) with an MSI-H tumor and an identified germline 
pathogenic variant in a mismatch repair gene met these criteria. Of the 14 cases with 
germline mismatch repair mutations, 6 were incrementally detected by germline analysis in 
the absence of a family history diagnostic of Lynch syndrome, including 3 patients with 
bladder cancer and 3 with prostate cancer. Of these 6 cases, 3 demonstrated LOH or a 
second somatic mutation (Table 3).
Discussion
This study identified clinically actionable inherited mutations in 17.5% of patients with 
advanced cancer, compared with 3% to 12.6% in prior series.1–7 Of the 1040 patients, 101

 (9.7%) would not have been detected using clinical guidelines, which represented 55.5% of 
the total of 182 patients with actionable findings in the series. Germline findings led to 
discussion or initiation of change to targeted therapy in 38 (3.7%) of the 1040 patients tested 
and predictive testing in the families of 13 individuals (1.3%), including 6 for whom genetic 
evaluation would not have been initiated by guideline-based testing.
The prevalence of germline variants in a clinical setting will be affected by stage, case mix, 
ethnic ancestry of the population, and methods of variant classification. There was a 
significantly greater overall prevalence of germline mutations observed in patients with 
metastatic disease, although the proportion of germline findings that were incremental to 
predictions based on family history (approximately 50%) was similar in metastatic and 
nonmetastatic disease. This interesting association may reflect more aggressive biological 
features (eg, via greater mutational load of deleterious variants) or improved chance of 
survival with metastases in those with germline mutations. However, in the cohort studied 
here, there was no association of inherited mutations with increased tumor mutational load 
or difference in time from diagnosis to metastatic disease; further molecular profiling and 
prospective studies of treatment response may provide an explanation for the increased 
prevalence of germline mutations in metastatic disease. In this series, there was an 
abundance of late-stage prostate, pancreatic, renal, and breast cancers in which germline 
variants were more frequent, probably accounting for the higher observed prevalence of 
pathogenic variants found here compared with prior studies. While these findings reflect the 
experience at a referral cancer center, had the case mix more closely resembled population 
cancer incidence rates, the proportion of incremental findings would have been 49.1%. Had 
the entire cohort been screened for ancestry-specific (Ashkenazi and northern European) 
mutations, the proportion of incremental actionable findings would have been 31.3%, 
approximating the rate in a hypothetical cohort with no population diversity. However, if 
family history assessment by clinicians is less complete than the 3-generation information 
used in this analysis, the proportion of apparent incremental findings may be higher in 
practice. Thus, guideline-based testing will fail to detect a third to half (31.3%–55.5%) of 
genetic findings found by tumor-normal sequencing, taking into account case mix, disease 
stage, and ethnic ancestry.
The complementary role of tumor and germline sequencing was exemplified by colon and 
breast cancer testing. Tumor-normal testing was able to diagnose Lynch syndrome in 
patients who would not otherwise have been tested. The sensitivity of tumor-derived 
hypermutation or MSI-H status for detection of Lynch syndrome was 85.7%, with germline 
sequencing resulting in the diagnosis of Lynch syndrome in an additional 2 patients, 1 of 
whom would not have been diagnosed by family history. Half of the 12 cases with 
pathogenic variants in mismatch repair genes in the setting of a hyper-mutated or MSI-H 
tumor would not have met guideline-based criteria for tumor-directed immunohistochemical 
analysis. For breast cancer cases, had tumor-only testing been performed, approximately 
40% of patients with BRCA1/2 variants detected with tumor sequencing would have been 
referred for a germline confirmation test that would have been negative; conversely 
“subtraction” of germline from tumor DNA sequence would have obscured 59 germline 
BRCA1/2 cases. These observations support the rationale for combined tumor-normal 
sequencing.3,34

 Although epigenetic mechanisms of loss of the second allelemay also exist, concurrent 
somatic alterations in the same gene or LOH in matched tumors support the pathogenic role 
of many of the germline variants observed in nonsyndromic settings. For example, germline 
CHEK2 mutations were observed in 6 patients with renal cancer; the second allele was 
mutated in 3 of 5 evaluable tumors. Among novel nonsyndromic associations seen here, 
mutations in CHEK2 were enriched in prostate and pancreas cancers, MUTYH 
heterozygous mutations were enriched in prostate cancer, and mutations in MSH6, BARD1, 
PALB2, MITF, and SDHB, were observed absent the typical family history associated with 
these genes. Other unanticipated findings reported here will require further functional and 
genetic epidemiological genomic exploration, including the observation of the recurrent 
mutation FH c.1431_1433dupAAA (p.Lys477dup) and RECQL4 loss-of-function 
variants.35–37
To our knowledge, this study marks the first large-scale effort to return germline findings in 
the context of tumor-normal sequencing to patients. Such an approach in patients with 
advanced cancer was found to uncover potentially actionable germline variants that would 
not be detected using existing guidelines for genetic risk assessment. Less resource intensive 
strategies than tumor-normal sequencing could be applied but would result in lower 
sensitivity. For example, testing all patients for a dozen DNA repair genes and several APC 
and MUTYH founder mutations, combined with standard phenotypic assessment, would 
have detected 92.3% of patients with clinically actionable germline variants.
This study has several limitations. Among these is the lack of sufficient follow-up to assess 
the effect of the genetic information on patient or family outcomes, including potential 
harms due to false-positive results of screening. In addition, there was physician discretion 
for referral for tumor sequencing, potentially favoring enrollment of those who may have 
been eligible for targeted therapies. The usual care comparator in this study was synthetic 
and not the actual yield of testing a population according to guidelines. Also, interpretation 
of detailed family history information was by expert reviewers using reproducible but 
complex algorithms. In addition, the study had unique demographic characteristics and case 
mix. These factors will limit generalizability of findings to a community practice 
environment, where germline testing panels are also being introduced.38
Conclusions
In this referral population with selected advanced cancers, universal sequencing of a broad 
panel of cancer-related genes in paired germline and tumor DNA samples was associated 
with increased detection of individuals with potentially clinically significant heritable 
mutations over the predicted yield of targeted germline testing based on current clinical 
guidelines. Knowledge of these additional mutations can help guide therapeutic and 
preventive interventions, but whether all of these interventions would improve outcomes for 
patients with cancer or their family members requires further study.

 Key Points
Question
How many additional individuals with inherited cancer-predisposing mutations might be 
detected by DNA sequencing of tumor and normal tissue in patients with advanced 
cancer compared with restricting genetic testing to clinical guideline–directed testing?
Findings
In this case series of 1040 patients with advanced cancer, 101 of 182 patients with 
clinically actionable inherited mutations detected by tumor-normal sequencing would not 
have been detected by guideline-directed testing based on family history, age, and tumor 
type.
Meaning
In selected populations of patients with advanced cancer, universal sequencing of 
germline and tumor DNA for a broad panel of cancer-related genes may detect more 
potentially clinically significant heritable mutations than a targeted approach based on 
current clinical guidelines. It is not known if this will result in improved outcomes.

aFor the determination of the total number of patients with advanced cancer with pathogenic variants per gene, patients with 2 pathogenic variants 
were classified according to the higher-penetrance variant (eAppendix 5 in Supplement 1), resulting in different values compared with the total 
number of pathogenic variants by gene.
bRefers to the FH c. 1431_1433dupAAA (p. Lys477dup) mutation considered as a recessive allele.
cRefers to the CHEK2 c.470T>C (p.Ile157Thr) mutation classified as a variant of uncertain clinical actionability.

cThe following indicate the tumor status: LOH, status of the second allele in the tumor of the gene mutated in the germline; WT, that the second 
allele was not mutated; second mutation, the second allele was mutated in the tumor in the same gene demonstrating a germline variant; CN-LOH, 
LOH in the tumor not accompanied by changes of copy number in the chromosomal region around the mutation; ND, cases in which zygosity was 
not determined; h+, hypermutated tumor profile (≥20 mutations); h−, not hypermutated tumor profile (<20 mutations); m+, microsatellite instability 
high (MSI sensor positive; ≥10% of loci on the sequencing panel); and m−, microsatellite instability negative (MSI sensor negative; <10% of loci 
on the sequencing panel).
dPatients had additional cancer diagnoses.

fThe MSH6 variant in this case is a founder variant (see eTable in Supplement 3) and was not counted toward the total of high-penetrance cases 
with nonfounder variants, but it is included here to illustrate one of the incremental cases with hypermutation status and MSI sensor data.
