Pain and Mortality in Older Adults:
The Influence of Pain Phenotype
DIANE SMITH,1 ROSS WILKIE,1 PETER CROFT,1 AND JOHN MCBETH2
Objective. Moderate to severe chronic pain affects 1 in 5 adults. Pain may increase the risk of mortality, but the rela-
tionship is unclear. This study investigated whether mortality risk was influenced by pain phenotype, characterized
by pain extent or pain impact on daily life.
Methods. The study population was drawn from 2 large population cohorts of adults ages ≥50 years, the English Lon-
gitudinal Study of Ageing (n = 6,324) and the North Staffordshire Osteoarthritis Project (n = 10,985). Survival analyses
(Cox’s proportional hazard models) estimated the risk of mortality in participants reporting any pain and then sepa-
rately according to the extent of pain (total number of pain sites, widespread pain according to the American College
of Rheumatology [ACR] criteria, and widespread pain according to Manchester criteria) and pain impact on daily life
(pain interference and often troubled with pain). Models were cumulatively adjusted for age, sex, education, and
wealth/adequacy of income.
Results. After adjustments, the report of any pain (mortality rate ratio [MRR] 1.06 [95% confidence interval (95% CI)
0.95–1.19]) or having widespread pain (ACR 1.07 [95% CI 0.92–1.23] or Manchester 1.16 [95% CI 0.99–1.36]) was not
associated with an increased risk of mortality. Participants who were often troubled with pain (MRR 1.29 [95% CI
1.12–1.49]) and those who reported quite a bit of pain interference (MRR 1.38 [95% CI 1.20–1.59]) and extreme pain
interference (MRR 1.88 [1.54–2.29]) had an increased risk of all-cause mortality.
Conclusion. Pain that interferes with daily life, rather than pain per se, was associated with an increased risk of mor-
tality. Future studies should investigate the mechanisms through which pain increases mortality risk.
INTRODUCTION
Pain has a major impact on individuals and society (1),
is acknowledged by the World Health Organization and
the United Nations as a global problem, and is increas-
ingly recognized as a condition in its own right (2). A
significant proportion of people in the general popula-
tion develop persistent disabling pain, and this pain con-
tributes to the high number of years lost to disability
attributed to painful conditions (3). However, pain may
also carry an increased risk of mortality, although the
risk is unclear and the evidence contradictory (4,5).
Some of the risk may be attributed to underlying disease
such as cancer, which is considered to cause the pain
(3), but the important question of whether the experience
or nature of chronic pain confers a risk of premature
death is unresolved (4–13).
A recent systematic review and meta-analysis of the
relationship between chronic pain and mortality (14)
indicated a modest but nonsignificant risk of mortality
for
people
with
pain,
but
with
high
heterogeneity
between studies. An important source of variability was
differences in pain phenotype between studies, with
heterogeneous definitions of pain defined on the basis of
pain extent (number of locations), duration, and impact.
Previous studies have suggested that mortality risk may
be influenced by pain extent and duration (8,15). For
example, strong associations have been reported between
chronic widespread pain and mortality (mortality rate
ratio [MRR] 2.8 [95% confidence interval (95% CI) 1.3–
6.1]) (9), and people with fibromyalgia who satisfied the
more stringent American College of Rheumatology (ACR)
2010 criteria had an increased risk of mortality when
compared to those satisfying the less stringent 1990 crite-
ria only (hazard ratio [HR] 1.62 [95% CI 1.19–2.21])
(11,16). The aim of this study was to investigate the
effect of pain phenotype on the association between pain

tion with mortality increases with increasing pain extent
and impact on daily life.
MATERIALS AND METHODS
Design
overview,
setting,
and
participants. Two
population-based cohort studies of older adults were used
in this study, the English Longitudinal Study of Ageing
(ELSA) (17) and the North Staffordshire Osteoarthritis
Project (NorStOP). The data collection methods for these
studies are described in detail elsewhere (18,19). Briefly,
ELSA is a large-scale longitudinal panel study of the
health, economic, and social circumstances of adults ages
≥50 years in England, which began in 2002. NorStOP is a
cohort study designed to assess the prevalence and impact
of pain in a community sample of adults ages ≥50 years in
North Staffordshire, England. NorStOP also began in 2002.
Pain and putative confounders were identified using data
from wave 2 (collected in 2004) of ELSA and the NorStOP
baseline samples (collected during 2002–2005). A total of
6,324 participants (67%) in the ELSA and 10,985 parti-
cipants (59%) of the NorStOP study had complete pre-
dictor, outcome, and putative confounders data (including
characteristics tested as mediators in a subsequent study)
and were used in this analysis. (For information on how
these samples were derived, see Supplementary Figures 1
and 2, available on the Arthritis Care & Research web site
at
http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/acr.23268/
abstract.)
Pain phenotypes.
Often troubled. Participants in the
ELSA were asked whether they were often troubled with
pain. Those replying yes were classified as being often
troubled with pain (see Supplementary Table 1, available
on the Arthritis Care & Research web site at http://online
library.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/acr.23268/abstract).
Severity. Participants who were classified as being
often troubled with pain were then asked to rate the
severity of their pain as mild, moderate, or severe.
Participants in the NorStOP study were asked: “In the
past 4 weeks have you had pain that has lasted for 1 day
or longer in any part of your body (not including pain
from illnesses such as flu)?” Those participants who
responded yes were categorized as having any pain.
Widespread pain. Participants in the NorStOP study
classified as having any pain were then asked to shade
the site of their pain on a blank body manikin (front and
back views). Based on their pain reports, those satisfying
the ACR criteria for widespread pain (pain in the axial
skeleton, on the right and left sides of the body, and
above
and
below
the
waist)
(20)
were
identified.
NorStOP
participants
who
satisfied
the
Manchester
criteria for widespread pain (pain in both the axial
skeleton and at least 2 sections of 2 contralateral limbs)
(21) were also identified.
Number of pain sites and interference. In addition, for
participants in the NorStOP study the number of shaded
areas on the body manikin (range 1–44) was calculated
and categorized into quartiles of 1–3 sites, 4–6 sites, 7–11
sites, and ≥12 sites of pain. NorStOP participants were
asked to complete the Medical Outcomes Study Short
Form 12 (22), which includes the question “During the
past 4 weeks how much did pain interfere with your
normal work (including both work outside the home and
housework)?” (extremely, quite a bit, moderately, a little
bit, or not at all).
Vital status. Vital status for the ELSA sample was
obtained from the Office of National Statistics and for
the NorStOP sample from the patient registration system
held at the local Primary Care Trust and from dates of
death notified to the NorStOP project team. These latter
dates of death were confirmed using manual tracing of
the
National
Health
Service
Summary
Care
Record
Demographic system.
The statistical analysis used Cox’s proportional hazard
modeling to assess the risk of death according to pain
phenotype (see below for details). To calculate HRs, it
was necessary to determine the length of time until the
event (death) or censoring took place. For participants in
the ELSA, information on year of death was available
until the end of February 2012. Time in the study was
calculated in months from the date of interview until
December 31 in the year the participant was known to
have died (or February 28 if they died in 2012). The cen-
sor date for those who survived was February 28, 2012.
For participants in the NorStOP study, the number of
days participants remained in the study from the date of
questionnaire completion to the date of death or censor-
ing was used. Information on vital status was available
until October 1, 2012.
Putative
confounders. Demographic
variables
were
age,
sex,
and
socioeconomic
status
indicated
by
educational attainment and current wealth (ELSA) or
adequacy of income (NorStOP). These variables were
considered to be the major potential confounders of the
mortality-phenotype
link
according
to
the
analytic
strategy used in this study. In both data sets, age was
categorized into year bands: 50–59, 60–69, 70–79, and
≥80 years.
For educational attainment, in ELSA, participants were
asked to look at a card listing educational qualifications
and indicate which, if any, they held. Participants were
categorized
to
the
highest
qualification
they
held
(National Vocational Qualification [NVQ]4/5: degree or
equivalent, higher education [university] below degree;
NVQ3: advanced level equivalent; NVQ2: ordinary level
equivalent; NVQ1: certificate of secondary [high school]

 education or equivalent; or foreign/other or no qualifica-
tion). In NorStOP educational attainment was assessed
by asking participants to indicate whether they had con-
tinued
full-time
education
beyond
school
(response
options yes/no), which formed a dichotomous variable
indicating school education/further education.
For wealth, in ELSA, net total nonpension wealth was
categorized by using quintiles to provide 5 groups labeled
from low to high. This measure of wealth has been found
to be the strongest socioeconomic predictor of health in
the ELSA sample (23). In NorStOP perceived adequacy of
income was measured with a single item. Participants
were asked to compare the adequacy of their income with
their living costs and indicate their situation (find it a
strain to get by from week to week, have to be careful with
money, able to manage without much difficulty, or quite
comfortably off). This item measures a range of financial
circumstances (from affluence to poverty) without eliciting
details of responders’ income and is a robust indicator of
financial capacity in older adults (24).
Statistical analysis. A comparison between the study
samples (ELSA: n = 6,324, NorStOP: n = 10,985) and larger
samples
containing participants
with only predictor,
outcome, and putative confounder information (ELSA: n =
8,572, NorStOP: n = 14,023), i.e., those without complete
data for the characteristics tested as mediators in a
subsequent study, was undertaken to assess for potential
selection bias (for details, see Supplementary Figures 1
and 2, available on the Arthritis Care & Research web site
at
http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/acr.23268/
abstract).
A
weighted
analysis,
where
weights
were
calculated using age, sex, education, and wealth/income
variables and applied to the study sample to estimate the
effects in the larger sample, was also undertaken to assess
for selection bias. The distribution of demographic and
socioeconomic factors was examined by vital status in
both samples.
Cox’s
proportional
hazard
modeling
was
used
to
assess the risk of death for each pain phenotype, using
time to death as the outcome. First, univariate models
were constructed to examine the association between
each pain phenotype and mortality (model 1). Then in
multivariable models, the association for each pheno-
type was cumulatively adjusted for age and sex (model
2) and then education and wealth (ELSA)/adequacy of
income (NorStOP) (model 3). The assumption of propor-
tionality for each of the survival models was tested
using Schoenfeld tests and plots of Schoenfeld residu-
als. These assumptions were valid for the categories:
often troubled with pain, pain severity, any pain, or
widespread pain (ACR criteria) and widespread pain
(Manchester criteria). For pain interference, Schoenfeld
tests indicated the assumption of proportionality did
not hold, and so the period was divided into 2 periods
in accordance with previous research (25); the first peri-
od ranged from 0–365 days and the second period was
>366
days
(i.e.,
2–10
years).
The
proportionality
assumption was met for both of these periods. Stata
software, version 13, was used for all analyses. The
results of the Cox’s proportional hazard models are
presented as mortality rate ratios (MRRs) with 95% con-
fidence intervals (95% CIs).
RESULTS
Sample
characteristics.
ELSA. There
were
6,324
participants included in the ELSA sample for the analysis
of the relationship between mortality and often troubled
with pain and pain severity. The median age of the sample
was 63 years and 55% were women (see Supplementary
Table 2, available on the Arthritis Care & Research
web site at http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/acr.
23268/abstract). Those with missing data were more likely
to be troubled with pain, have greater severity of pain, be
older, be women, have lower levels of education, and be
financially poorer than those with complete data (see
Supplementary Table 2, available at http://onlinelibrary.
wiley.com/doi/10.1002/acr.23268/abstract).
The length of time in the study for those who died (n
= 764 [12.1%]) ranged 0–90 months from the date of
interview, with a mean � SD survival time of 54.1 �
24.7 months. Within 12 months of the interview date, 40
deaths (5.2%) occurred. The proportion of the sample
who reported being often troubled with pain was 35.9%,
with 6.5% reporting this condition to be of severe inten-
sity (see Supplementary Table 3, available on the Arthri-
tis Care & Research web site at http://onlinelibrary.wile
y.com/doi/10.1002/acr.23268/abstract). The proportion of
the sample educated to degree level or above was 14.5%.
Participants who died during 8 years of followup (n =
764), compared with those who remained alive (n =
5,560), were older and more likely to be men, to have
lower socioeconomic status (i.e., lower education and
wealth), to be often troubled with pain, and to report
greater severity of pain (see Supplementary Table 3,
available
at http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/
acr.23268/abstract).
NorStOP. There were 10,985 participants included in
the NorStOP sample for the analysis of the relationship
between mortality and any pain, widespread pain (ACR
and Manchester criteria), number of pain sites, and pain
interference. The median age was 63 years and 54% of
the sample were women. Participants with complete data
were more likely to be younger, less likely to be women,
be better educated, have greater adequacy of income, and
report pain interference than those with missing data
(see Supplementary Table 4, available on the Arthritis
Care & Research web site at http://onlinelibrary.wiley.
com/doi/10.1002/acr.23268/abstract).
The length of time in the study for participants who
died (n = 1,484 [13.5%]) ranged from 7 days to 3,823
days from the date of response, with a mean � SD sur-
vival time of 2,036 � 1,052 days. Within 12 months from
the date of response 6.5% (n = 97) of deaths occurred.
The proportion of the sample reporting any pain was
71.2%, with 25.0% of the sample meeting the ACR crite-
ria for widespread pain and 15.7% meeting the Manches-
ter criteria for widespread pain (see Supplementary
Table 4, available at http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/
10.1002/acr.23268/abstract). The proportion of the sam-
ple reporting pain at ≥12 anatomic sites was 18.8%, and
238
Smith et al
 5.5% of the sample reported extreme pain interference.
Participants who died in the NorStOP sample were more
likely to be older, men, of lower socioeconomic status
(measured according to education and income), and more
likely to report pain interference. There were no differ-
ences in the report of any pain, ACR widespread pain,
Manchester widespread pain, and number of pain sites
between those who died and those who remained alive
(see Supplementary Table 5, available on the Arthritis
Care & Research web site at http://onlinelibrary.wiley.c
om/doi/10.1002/acr.23268/abstract).
An exploration of the relationship between the number
of pain sites and pain interference variable used in this
study was undertaken (Table 1). The highest proportion
of deaths occurred for those reporting only 1–3 sites of
pain but extreme pain interference (37.5%).
The
relationship
between
pain
phenotypes
and
mortality.
Often troubled with pain and pain severity
(ELSA cohort). The rate of mortality was higher in those
often troubled with pain when compared to those not
often troubled with pain (see Supplementary Figure 3,
available on the Arthritis Care & Research web site at
http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/acr.23268/abstract),
and this finding remained significant when adjusted for
putative confounders (Table 2). When compared to those
reporting
they
were
not
often
troubled
with
pain,
participants who reported being often troubled with mild
pain were no more likely to die over the followup period,
but
participants
reporting
being

by
moderate or severe pain had increased mortality risks.

Influence of Pain Phenotype on Mortality
239
 for age,
sex, education, and wealth (model 3).
The
weighted analysis had little effect on the results (Table 2).
Any pain (NorStOP cohort). Visually, the mortality rate
was higher across the study period for those with any pain
compared to those with no pain (see Supplementary
Figure 4, available on the Arthritis Care & Research web
site at http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/acr.23268/
abstract). However, there was no statistically significant
increased risk of mortality for participants with any pain
(model 1), with no change when adjusted for potential
confounders (models 2 and 3) (Table 3).
Widespread
pain:
ACR
and
Manchester
criteria
(NorStOP cohort). There was no association between
mortality and widespread pain by the ACR criteria or for
widespread pain that did not meet the ACR criteria
(Table 3). For participants with widespread pain that
met the Manchester criteria, there was an increased risk
of mortality in the analyses adjusted for age and sex
only. There was no increased risk of mortality for pain
that did not meet the Manchester criteria for widespread
pain (Table 3).
Number of pain sites (NorStOP cohort). There was a
significant increased risk of mortality for participants
with ≥12 pain sites adjusted for age and sex only. There
was no trend of increased mortality risk with number of
pain sites (Table 3). The weighted analysis for all of the
above phenotypes had little effect.
Pain interference (NorStOP cohort). Pain interference
was associated with increased mortality over time (see
Supplementary Figure 5, available on the Arthritis Care
& Research web site at http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/
doi/10.1002/acr.23268/abstract).
The
risk
of
mortality
associated with pain interference was higher in the first
year of followup than for the following 9 years (Tables 4
and 5). There were 97 deaths in the first 12 months, with
risk associated with increasing pain interference. A little
and moderate pain interference were not associated with
increased mortality. Pain that interfered quite a bit was
associated in the crude model and when adjusted for age
and sex, but this finding attenuated and became nonsig-
nificant when adjusted for age, sex, education, and
adequacy of income. Extreme pain
interference was
associated with an increased risk of mortality in all
models (Table 4).
In the period 366 days to 10 years of followup, there
was no increased risk of mortality for participants with a
little pain interference in the crude or adjusted models.
For participants who indicated moderate pain interfer-
ence, there was an increased risk of mortality in the
crude model only, which attenuated and became non-
significant when adjusted for confounders. Compared to
those with no pain, participants reporting quite a bit or
extreme pain interference had an increased risk of mor-
tality in all models (Table 5). A weighted analysis was

DISCUSSION
This study investigated the association between pain phe-
notype and mortality in 2 large population-based data sets.
For the first time, we found that the strongest association
with mortality was a measure of the impact or trouble-
someness of pain in daily life, consistent across both
cohorts studied, while the presence of pain (yes/no) was
not
associated.
The
magnitude
of
the
relationship
observed in the ELSA data set between troubling pain and
all-cause mortality (MRR 1.29 [95% CI 1.12–1.49]) was
consistent with the association between pain that inter-
feres with daily life (to a moderate extent or more) and
mortality in the NorStOP study. This consistency between
the 2 cohorts adds to the credibility of this finding.
By contrast with some previous findings from the liter-
ature, measures of the presence and extent of pain were
not consistently associated with mortality risk. The phe-
notypes of pain extent tested in the NorStOP sample
were comparable to phenotypes used in other studies
(4,7), but the results did not confirm those studies.
Macfarlane et al (4) used the ACR criteria to categorize
widespread pain and found a 30% increased risk of mor-
tality among those meeting the criteria after adjusting for
age, sex, and study location, confirmed in a later study
by McBeth et al (7), that additionally adjusted for ethnic
group and Townsend score of deprivation. However, in
the current study, participants meeting the ACR criteria
for widespread pain did not have an increased risk of
mortality.
The findings from the NorStOP sample regarding the
number of pain sites were unexpected, as associations
between increasing number of pain sites and a reduction
in overall health, sleep quality, psychological health and
decreased function (26), and increased mortality (7) have

Influence of Pain Phenotype on Mortality

 been reported. In the current study, the highest propor-
tion of deaths occurred for those reporting only 1–3 sites
of pain but extreme pain interference (37.5%) (Table 1).
Although there were only a small number of participants
in this category, the finding does suggest that the link is
with impact rather than with pain and pain extent per
se. There is some correlation between a greater number
of
pain
sites
and
the
extent
of
pain
interference
(Table 1), but in the multivariable models, it is pain
interference, and not number of pain sites, that is inde-
pendently associated with increased mortality in this
study. We conclude that the presence and extent of pain
is not related to mortality, but the impact that pain has
on an individual’s daily life is.
Although there were some contrasts in the findings
from the phenotypes in the NorStOP sample compared
to previous studies, the pain phenotype data in NorStOP
were collected using a validated approach and found in
previous analyses to be reliable (27). Our prevalence esti-
mates for pain and widespread pain in the NorStOP sam-
ple are higher than those reported in previous UK
population-based studies such as Macfarlane et al (5)
and McBeth et al (7), likely due to the sample being
restricted to adults ages ≥50 years.
It was not possible to test all of the pain phenotypes
within the same data set. Differences in the structure of
the study population may have influenced the observed
relationships between pain phenotype and mortality.
ELSA samples are generated with the intention of being
representative of the English population of adults ages
≥50 years. In contrast, the NorStOP data set is sampled
from a small number (n = 8) of general practices in North
Staffordshire and is less likely to be nationally represen-
tative. However, the age and sex structure of the partici-
pating NorStOP population is similar to that of North
Staffordshire and to England and Wales (28). Investiga-
tion of the age and sex distribution of the samples used
for this study revealed that the ELSA and NorStOP sam-
ples had similar structures to each other. Although selec-
tive
samples
were
used
and
some
differences
in
demographic and socioeconomic characteristics between
those with and without missing data were indicated,
there was sufficient power to detect the expected effect
sizes (based on previous literature), and a weighted anal-
ysis indicated the missing data did not introduce bias to
the results.
Vital status in the ELSA sample was determined using
records from the Office of National Statistics, whereas in
NorStOP information was collated from 2 sources, the
Exeter Patient Registration System held at the local Pri-
mary Care Trust and through manual tracing of the
National Health Service Summary Care Record Demo-
graphic system. Misclassifications may have occurred,
resulting in an under- or overestimation of the true rela-
tionship between pain and mortality. However, the UK is
considered to have high-quality death registration data
(29), so any inaccuracies should be minimal.
Only the year of death information was available from
the ELSA data set for this study. This limitation has
implications for the accuracy of the observed MRRs. For
participants
who
died,
the
time
in
the
study
was
calculated from their date of interview until December
31 in the year the participant was known to have died.
The actual date of death may have been earlier, meaning
survival time was overestimated and mortality risk was
underestimated for ELSA participants in the current
study.
The current study used data obtained from 2 large pop-
ulation-based surveys with high response rates, and the
relationship between a number of different pain pheno-
types and mortality could be investigated. Although we
could not determine chronic pain (i.e., lasting for ≥3
months) in either data set, this inability is unlikely to
have affected the results, as 80–90% of widespread pain
is chronic (4). Pain was measured at one time point only,
and participants may have been misclassified or changed
pain state over the followup period. This possibility
would result in an inaccurate representation of the rela-
tionship between pain and mortality (either an under- or
overestimation), but the number of misclassifications of
pain state is likely to be small, resulting in minimal
effect on the overall findings.
Early deaths possibly resulted from causes (such as
cancer) that predated the onset of pain, and this possibil-
ity might have dominated our findings. Our analysis of
pain interference, because it separated mortality in the
first year of followup from later deaths (Tables 4 and 5),
provided an opportunity to examine this possibility.
Although the point estimate of mortality risk was highest
in the extreme interference group in the first year, ele-
vated risks of mortality after 12 months were seen for all
grades of interference and were statistically more stable
than those for year 1. This finding argues against any
substantial influence of this form of bias.
The findings from the current study demonstrated an
increased risk of mortality for people who had pain that
impacted their life. A measure of pain impact along with
measures of presence and location would be a useful
addition to any future studies of pain and mortality. One
of the research implications that follows from our study
is the need to identify what it is about interfering pain
that causes premature mortality. Factors such as comor-
bid disease, lifestyle behaviors, or psychological factors
might provide links between pain that specifically dis-
ables or interferes with life and premature mortality. For
example, pain that impacts life is linked to a reduction
in physical activity, which is associated with increasing
weight and the onset of health conditions (e.g., cardio-
vascular disease) that lead to mortality. Future analyses
could usefully explore such pathways to identify targets
for intervention to reduce the impact of pain on daily life
and hence on premature mortality. The impact of pain
was more important than the presence or extent of pain
in the relationship between pain and mortality.
