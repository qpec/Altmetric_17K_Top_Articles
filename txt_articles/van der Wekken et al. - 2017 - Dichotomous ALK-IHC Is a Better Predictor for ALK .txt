Abstract
Purpose: ALK rearrangement detection using FISH is the stan-
dard test to identify patients with non–small cell lung carcinoma
(NSCLC) eligible for treatment with ALK inhibitors. Recently, ALK
protein expression in resectable NSCLC showed predictive value.
We evaluated tumor response rate and survival after crizotinib
treatment of patients with advanced NSCLC with ALK activation
using both dichotomous immunohistochemical (IHC) staining
and FISH.
Experimental Design: Patients with stage IV NSCLC treated
with crizotinib were selected. Tumor response was assessed. ALK
rearrangements were detected by FISH (Vysis ALK-break-apart
FISH-Probe KIT) and IHC [Ventana ALK (D5F3) CDx assay].
Cohorts of patients with ALK-FISH–positive advanced NSCLC
from four other hospitals were used for validation.
Results: Twenty-nine consecutive patients with ALK-positive
advanced NSCLC diagnosed by FISH and/or IHC on small biop-
sies or fine-needle aspirations (FNA) were treated with ALK
inhibitors. All ALK-IHC–positive patients responded to crizotinib
except three with primary resistance. No tumor response was
observed
in
13
ALK-FISH–positive
but
ALK-IHC–negative
patients. This was confirmed in an external cohort of 16 patients.
Receiver operator characteristic (ROC) curves for ALK-IHC and
ALK-FISH compared with treatment outcome showed that dichot-
omous ALK-IHC outperforms ALK-FISH [tumor response area
under the curve: (AUC), 0.86 vs. 0.64, P ¼ 0.03; progression-free
survival (PFS): AUC 0.86vs. 0.36, P ¼ 0.005; overall survival (OS):
AUC, 0.78 vs. 0.41, P ¼ 0.01, respectively].
Conclusions: Dichotomous ALK-IHC is superior to ALK-FISH
on small biopsies and FNA to predict tumor response and
survival to crizotinib for patients with advanced NSCLC. Our
data strongly suggest adapting the guidelines and using dichot-
omous ALK-IHC as standard companion diagnostic test to select
patients with NSCLC who benefit from ALK-targeting therapy.

Introduction
In 2007, the first report of an echinoderm microtubule–asso-
ciated protein like 4 -anaplastic lymphoma kinase (EML4/ALK)
fusion gene on chromosome 2p in lung cancer has been published
(1). EML4/ALK variants with different breakpoints and other
fusion partners for ALK have been identified, for example,
KIF5B, TRK, TPR, KLC1, DCTN, and SQSTM (1–4). EML4/ALK
rearrangement occurs in approximately 5% of patients with
advanced
non–squamous
non-small
cell
lung
carcinoma
(NSCLC; refs. 1, 5–7). In stages I to III, NSCLC ALK rearrangement
frequency is 3.2% (8).
In 2010, crizotinib has been registered as the first drug for
treating EML4/ALK-positive patients with advanced NSCLC.
Phase II studies in patients with ALK-break–positive NSCLC
defined by FISH revealed tumor response rates up to 65%
(4, 9). Phase III studies confirmed the response rate and showed
an improved survival compared with chemotherapy (10). In these

 studies, no major differences were observed between ALK rear-
rangements, expression of fusions at RNA, and ALK detection at
protein level. However, the explanation why some patients with
an ALK rearrangement did not respond to initial ALK inhibitors
was not solved.
In the United States, the CE-IVD–marked Abbott FISH kit was
registered as a companion diagnostic for crizotinib. The Ventana
ALK (D5F3) CDx assay is approved as a CE-IVD in Europe, China
(www.ventana.com), and the United States (www.fda.gov) since
2012, 2013, and June 2015, respectively. This test is used on a fully
automatic BenchMark XT and with a dichotomous scoring system.
This test is unambiguous and only provides a positive or negative
outcome (11). In Japan, ALK-RT-PCR is most commonly used in
the diagnosis of ALK status (12). In Europe, the European Med-
icinesAgency(EMA)allowstheuse ofclinicallyvalidatedmethods
to detect ALK positivity either by FISH or IHC. The FDA-approved
Abbott break-apart ALK-FISH probe and scoring using the inter-
national guidelines (www.Abbott.com) is labor-intensive, time-
consuming, and operator-dependent (13). Furthermore, the
detection of ALKrearrangements by FISHisnot alwaysconcordant
with ALK protein expression, although most studies show a
concordance close to 100% (7, 8, 12, 14, 15).
Recently, several articles have been published on the compar-
ison of different ALK-IHC and ALK-FISH tests. Most of these
studies used resection samples of which tissue microarrays (TMA)
were made (8, 12, 14, 15). In those studies only few patients have
been treated with crizotinib, probably at recurrence of disease. In
clinical practice, however, most patients with ALK-positive
NSCLC present with stage IV disease upon diagnosis. This is often
based on small biopsies and/or fine-needle aspiration (FNA),
which is usually not enough to build TMAs. In previous studies,
tests have been compared without investigating the predictive
value for treatment outcome.
Therefore, we explored the predictive value of Ventana ALK
(D5F3) CDx assay and the Abbott break-apart ALK-FISH test, on
small biopsies and FNA, taken for predictive screening in our
referral center. Cases were those who routinely tested and those
where the interpretation of the FISH test result was difficult for
tumor response to crizotinib in patients with stage IV NSCLC. We
hypothesized that dichotomous ALK-IHC, measuring the expres-
sion of the ALK protein containing the active kinase part, has a
better predictive value than ALK-FISH for ALK-positive patients
with high tumor responses and prolonged survival (11).
Materials and Methods
Patients
Screening group. All consecutive patients with stage IV non-squa-
mous carcinoma tested in our national referral center for ALK-
FISH testing resulted in a selected cohort of cases who had a
positive ALK test either by ALK-FISH or dichotomous ALK-IHC
scoring algorithm. Consecutive patients were those with routinely
established FISH and a highly selected group with difficult inter-
pretable FISH test results. From 2013 in parallel to ALK-FISH,
analysis was performed with Ventana ALK-IHC. Tissue blocks
were collected from all patients with ALK-FISH–positive tumors,
but without ALK-IHC data (mainly before 2013), used for ALK-
FISH, and when sufficient neoplastic cells were present, dichot-
omous ALK-IHC was performed. Twenty-nine ALK-positive
patients (either FISH or IHC positive) were treated with ALK
inhibitors and prospectively evaluated for patients' characteristics,
for example, smoking and performance score, and treatment
outcome. Tumor response was assessed on CT using RECIST
1.1 (16).
External validation group. An external validation set of ALK-FISH–
positive tumor samples from patients treated with crizotinib in 4
other hospitals was collected. To exclude laboratory quality
differences (e.g., FISH operator dependency) between hospitals
as potential bias, exchange of tumor samples and test results is
necessary. The samples were tested with the dichotomous ALK-
IHC at University Medical Centre Groningen (UMCG; Groningen,
the Netherlands). Response rates, duration of crizotinib treat-
ment, and survival were compared with dichotomous ALK-IHC
results.
Detection of ALK status by FISH
FISH was performed with the commercial LSI ALK dual-color,
break-apart rearrangement probe kit (Abbott Molecular Inc.
06N38-020) for the evaluation of ALK genomic status (ALK-
FISH). In brief, 4-mm formalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded (FFPE)
tissue or CytoLyt block sections were mounted on positively
charged glass slides and dried overnight at 60�C. Areas with
sufficient neoplastic cells were marked after review of the corre-
sponding hematoxylin and eosin (H&E) slide by a pathologist.
After deparaffinization, slides were pretreated in Tris-EDTA, pH
9.0, buffer at 120�C for 7 minutes in a pressure cooker, washed
and incubated in RNase (0.1 mg/mL diluted in 2� SSC) at 37�C
for 1 hour, washed again, and treated with pepsin (0.1% diluted
in 0.01 N HCl) at 37�C for 10 minutes (biopsies and FNA: 5
minutes); denaturation (12 minutes at 80�C) and hybridization
(overnight at 37�C) were performed. After hybridization,
slides were washed 2� SSC/0.3% NP-40 at 73�C for 2 minutes
followed by 2� SSC/0.1% NP-40 for 1 minute at room temper-
ature, dehydrated, air-dried (2� alcohol 96% and air-dried), and
finally, slides were mounted manually in Vectashield with 40,6-
diamidino-2-phenylindole (DAPI; 0.33 mg/mL diluted in Vecta-
shield). Stained sections were stored at 2�C to 8�C in the dark until
evaluation was performed to prevent fading of the fluorescent
signals. Using the appropriated filters, scoring was performed
according to the international guidelines (www.Abbott.com;
ref. 13) and analyzed independently by 2 experienced FISH
Translational Relevance
ALK rearrangement detection using FISH is the standard test
to identify patients with non–small cell lung carcinoma
(NSCLC) eligible for treatment with ALK inhibitors. Recently,
ALK protein expression in resectable NSCLC showed predic-
tive value. In this study, we evaluated tumor response rate and
survival after crizotinib treatment of patients with advanced
NSCLC with ALK activation using both dichotomous immu-
nohistochemical (IHC) staining and FISH. We have found that
dichotomous ALK-IHC is superior to ALK-FISH on small
biopsies and fine-needle aspirations (FNA) to predict tumor
response and survival to crizotinib for patients with advanced
NSCLC. Our data strongly suggest adapting the guidelines and
using dichotomous ALK-IHC as standard companion diag-
nostic test to select patients with NSCLC who benefit from
ALK-targeting therapy.

 evaluators. A case was considered ALK-FISH–positive when more
than 15% of the evaluated 100 neoplastic nuclei had the break-
apart pattern. In case of discordance, a third independent expe-
rienced assessor scored the sample. FISH was performed in the
laboratory of Molecular Pathology Department at the UMCG.
Moreover, in case, enough tumor tissue was present, ALK-FISH
was also performed at an international ALK-FISH laboratory
(Dr. P. Pauwels, Antwerp, Belgium) to confirm our test data.
The ALK-FISH for the external validation cohort was performed
in the local laboratories of Maastricht University Medical Centre
(MUMCþ; Maastricht, the Netherlands), ZGT (Hengelo, the
Netherlands), Vanderbilt University Medical Center (VUMC;
Nashville, TN), and Radboud UMC (Nijmegen, the Netherlands).
Detection of ALK expression status by immunohistochemistry
and dichotomous scoring
ALK-IHC was performed on 4-mm-thick FFPE tissue sections or
CytoLyt block sections using the Ventana ALK (D5F3) CDx assay
on a Ventana BenchMark XT automated slide-processing system
(Ventana Medical Systems Inc.). Briefly, slides of NSCLC tumor
were subjected to deparaffinization using EZ Prep (VMSI) and
`extended' Cell Conditioning 1. Tissue sections were incubated
with anti-ALK antibody (clone D5F3, VMSI) for 20 minutes.
OptiView DAB IHC Detection Kit (VMSI) and OptiView Ampli-
fication Kit (VMSI) were used according to the manufacturer's
recommendations for the visualization of the bound primary
antibody
(http://www.uclad.com/newsletters/ALK-LUNG-IHC-
INTERPRETATION-GUIDE.pdf; ref. 11). Tissue slides were coun-
terstained with Hematoxylin II and Bluing Reagent (VMSI). An
ALK-positive cell line embedded in agar/FFPE or sections of
normal appendix containing ALK-positive ganglion cells were
used as dichotomous ALK-IHC external controls in each run
(VMSI). For evaluating the staining results, a dichotomous scoring
system (positive or negative for ALK status) was used [package
insert for Ventana anti-ALK (D5F3) Rabbit Monoclonal Primary
Antibody, Cat. No. 790-4794 / 06679072001]. ALK expression
was assessed independently by one trained scientist and one
pathologist without knowledge of the FISH results or treatment
outcome. Strong granular cytoplasmic staining of neoplastic cells
(any percentage) is considered positive, only (11).
Validation of the fusion products by RT-PCR
cDNA was synthesized using 500 ng total RNA input with
Superscript II reverse transcriptase and random primers according
to the company instruction (Invitrogen). PCR was performed
using 10 ng cDNA as input in a final volume of 30 mL containing
1� PCR buffer and MgCl2 (final concentration. 1.5 mmol/L),
0.2 mL Taq DNA polymerase (5 unit/mL; Invitrogen), and 10
mmol/L primers designed using Clone Manager Suite (Sci-Ed
Software). Amplification consisted of 45 cycles using a thermo-
cycler (Bio-Rad). Primers detecting the known EML4/ALK fusion
variants are listed in Supplementary Table S1.
Statistical analysis
Statistics for patient characteristics were descriptive and c2 test
was used for comparison. ALK test performance of FISH and the
dichotomous IHC for screening and validation were compared
with receiver operating characteristics (ROC) method with pri-
mary outcome tumor response and survival. To test for confoun-
ders, uni- and multivariate analyses were performed. Progression-
free survival (PFS) was defined from the date of treatment start
until the date of disease progression or death. Overall survival
(OS) was defined from treatment start until the date of death. To
compare survival of different groups by Kaplan–Meier method,
log-rank test was used. For evaluating the influence of the per-
centage of breaks by FISH on PFS and OS, t test was used. P < 0.05
was considered significant. Statistical analyses were performed
with SPSS 22.0.
Results
Between January 2011 and July 2015, 29 patients with advanced
non-squamous NSCLC showed a positive ALK status (Supplemen-
tary Fig. S1), based on ALK-FISH (n ¼ 16), ALK-IHC (n ¼ 3), or
both (n ¼ 10). They were selected at a University Medical Center
and treated with crizotinib with a median follow up of 5.8 months
[95% confidence interval (CI), 0.0–15.4]. In 22 of 29 patients, ALK
tests were performed on endobronchial biopsies or transthoracic
punctures and in 8 patients on FNA obtained by endoscopic
ultrasound and/or endobronchial ultrasound. The median age of
the screening cohort was 58 years (range, 21–79). Twenty patients
were diagnosed with adenocarcinoma and 10 with NSCLC favor-
ing adenocarcinoma. Most patients were non-smokers (9 of 29) or
previous smokers (11 of 29) and had a good performance score of
0 to 1 (Table 1). Crizotinib (250 mg twice a day) was used as the
second-line treatment after chemotherapy in 22 of 29 patients and
in others as first-line therapy.
Treatment response of patients with ALK-positive NSCLC as
determined by break-apart FISH analysis
Twenty-six of 29 patients were ALK-FISH–positive with more
than 15% of 100 neoplastic nuclei with break-apart pattern.
Response rate (RR) in the FISH-positive group, including 13
dichotomous ALK-IHC–negative patients, was low (23%); the
median PFS (mPFS) was 1.8 months (95% CI, 1.4–2.2) and
median OS (mOS) was 5.3 months (95% CI, 0.0–15.4). Three
patients who were dichotomous ALK-IHC–positive and FISH-
negative had a RR of 67% with an mPFS of 5.0 months (95% CI,
0.0–11.2) and mOS of 5.8 months (95% CI, 0.5–11.1).
The median percentage of neoplastic nuclei with ALK breaks
was 35% (range, 2%–78%). No association was observed
between the percentage of ALK breaks and treatment outcome
as determined by RR, PFS, and OS (Table 2). Also, cases with ALK
rearrangement based on the loss of the 50-ALK-FISH probe result-
ing in the typical pattern with a single red FISH signal were found

 in 6 of 29 patients. This pattern was not associated with a better
treatment outcome.
The international ALK-FISH referral center confirmed our ALK-
FISH data in 14 cases of which enough tumor was present.
Treatment response of dichotomous patients with ALK-IHC–
positive NSCLC
In 26 of 29 patients, tumor tissue with sufficient neoplastic cells
was left to perform the dichotomous ALK-IHC test. Thirteen
tumors showed ALK expression whereas 13 were negative (all
13 were ALK-FISH–positive). In the dichotomous ALK-IHC–pos-
itive group, the RR was 69% with an mPFS of 8.4 months (95% CI,
3.1–13.7) and an mOS of 18.3 months (95% CI, 12.4–24.2). No
responses were observed in the dichotomous ALK-IHC–negative
group with an mPFS of 1.5 months (95% CI, 0.9–2.1) and an
mOS of 5.0 months (95% CI, 4.3–5.7). Univariate and multivar-
iate analyses revealed that dichotomous ALK-IHC was associated
with better treatment outcome as determined by tumor response
(P < 0.001), mPFS (P < 0.001), and mOS (P ¼ 0.01). The duration
of tumor responses is outlined in Fig. 1.
Three patients with dichotomous ALK-IHC–positive tumor had
no response to crizotinib, 1 patient died because of complications
of brain radiotherapy shortly after starting crizotinib (ALK24).
One patient died because of liver failure due to metastases with
necrosis on therapy (ALK20). In another patient, only a part of the
tumor at the border of the tissue section showed ALK-FISH
positivity while most neoplastic cells were ALK-FISH negative.
Retesting of the residual tissue using both ALK-FISH and dichot-
omous ALK-IHC revealed that the earlier observed FISH-positive
tumor area was not present anymore. All neoplastic cells were
negative
for
both
ALK-FISH
and
dichotomous
ALK-IHC
(ALK09; Fig. 2A). This could explain lack of tumor response.
In the third resistant patient (ALK 21; Fig. 2B), dichotomous ALK-
IHC showed heterogeneous immunostaining of the neoplastic
cells. Since all other dichotomous ALK-IHC–positive cases in this
study showed a homogeneously strong ALK expression of all
neoplastic cells (see Fig. 2C and D for examples), the presence
of the ALK-negative neoplastic cells in case ALK21 might explain
the short PFS.
One patient (ALK 10) without tumor response had stable
disease for 10 months.
Comparison of break-apart FISH, EML4/ALK-RT-PCR and
dichotomous ALK-IHC
Comparison of both dichotomous ALK-IHC and ALK-FISH test
performances showed a better prediction of tumor response
shifting the ROC from 0.64 to 0.86 (P ¼ 0.03) in favor of
dichotomous ALK-IHC (Fig. 3). This has been observed for
survival outcomes as well. Using PFS as the primary outcome,
ROC increased from 0.36 to 0.86 (P ¼ 0.005), and for OS, ROC

 increased from 0.41 to 0.78 (P ¼ 0.01). When dichotomous ALK-
IHC and ALK-FISH data were combined, tumor response and
survival were associated with ALK-IHC, independent of ALK-FISH
outcome in multivariate analysis. Dichotomous ALK-IHC out-
come was not associated with the percentage of neoplastic nuclei
with ALK break-apart patterns (range, 2%–78%; Supplementary
Fig. S2) which is in line with a previous study (17).
To explain the discrepancy between FISH and IHC, we
performed RT-PCR or exome sequencing. In one patient (ALK04),
RT-PCR confirmed the presence of ALK rearrangement (E20; A20,

 variant 2) that was not detected by ALK-FISH. This patient had one
of the longest PFS in our treatment cohort (15.9 months). Patient
(ALK09) was positive for ALK-FISH in a small area of neoplastic
cells only (<2%). Dichotomous ALK-IHC and EML4/ALK-RT-PCR
were both negative on the same tissue block that did not contain
the earlier small FISH-positive area anymore. This patient did not
respond to crizotinib. In 2 patients, dichotomous ALK-IHC could
not be performed, ALK-FISH was positive, and EML4/ALK-RT-
PCR was negative. Both patients did not respond to crizotinib.
In 5 responding patients, all 3 tests (dichotomous ALK-IHC,
ALK-FISH, ALK-RT-PCR) were positive (Table 2).
Validation cohort of dichotomous ALK-IHC compared with
response
In the 4 Dutch hospitals 53 patients were treated with crizotinib
on the basis of a positive ALK-FISH (Supplementary Fig. S1). Of
those, 16 patients had enough tumor tissue available to perform
the dichotomous Ventana (D5F3) ALK-IHC. Eleven patients had a
positive dichotomous ALK-IHC and 5 were negative. All 5 dichot-
omous ALK-IHC–negative patients did not have a response
to crizotinib. Response percentage in the IHC-positive patients
was 72. Three positive patients showed stable disease and 8 of 11
patients had a partial or complete response with crizotinib
(Table 3).
Discussion
This is the first systematic study in advanced NSCLC with small
amounts of tumor tissue to compare the value of the dichotomous
ALK-IHC and ALK-FISH test on the basis of tumor response
and survival as primary outcome. The dichotomous ALK-IHC
largely outperformed the ALK-FISH as measured by ROC in a
screening (one hospital) and validation (4 other hospitals) cohort
of patients with advanced ALK-positive NSCLC. All patients with a
negative dichotomous ALK-IHC did not respond to crizotinib.
Therefore, patients who were tested with the Ventana ALK (D5F3)
IHC did not need additional ALK-FISH testing. This is in contrast
to current guidelines (e.g., CAP/IASL/AMP 2013) that ALK-FISH
is required to confirm ALK-IHC status. We demonstrated
that these guidelines would even harm ALK-IHC–positive/ALK-
FISH–negative patients from not receiving the appropriate ALK
inhibitors.
Despite the large number of reports on the prevalence of ALK
positivity in NSCLC and the comparison of various detection
assays, few studies report on the optimal biomarker predicted
by tumor response to ALK inhibitors. ALK-IHC with 5A4 anti-
bodies were used in comparison with Vysis FISH in a French

 study of 45 patients, an Italian study with the ETOP consor-
tium, and a Japanese study (7, 12, 14). Importantly, none of
these studies took patient outcome as a measurement of test
efficacy. Other ALK-IHC and ALK-FISH tests are described in
Supplementary File.
The low response rate for the whole group was due to a
substantial number of patients with ALK-FISH–positive and
ALK-IHC–negative patients, indicating a selected population. All
those patients did not respond to crizotinib. The higher frequency
of these patients was due to the fact that our center not only
performs routinely FISH testing but also difficult interpretable
FISH testing. Therefore, we confirmed our ALK-FISH results in
the international ALK-FISH center. The dichotomous ALK-IHC–
positive group showed response rates and survival comparable to
second-line treatment as shown in the studies by Kwak and
colleagues and Shaw and colleagues (4, 10). Moreover, 2 dichot-
omous
ALK-IHC–positive
but
ALK-FISH–negative
patients
responded to crizotinib. This is similar as in a study by Pekar
and colleagues, where 2 such patients also responded to crizoti-
nib. These (ALK-IHC–positive and ALK-FISH–negative) patients
showed an ALK translocation as measured with next-generation
sequencing (NGS; ref. 18). Other patient reports showed a similar
outcome (14, 19, 20).
Comparison of ALK expression levels with the presence of ALK
rearrangements detected with FISH revealed an agreement
between 90% and 100% (11, 21–28).
Occasionally, patients have been described who were ALK-
FISH–positive but ALK-IHC–negative and who responded to
crizotinib. Ilie and colleagues showed 3 patients (EML4/ALK
break RT-PCR–negative also) who responded due to the fact
that they were cMET amplification–positive, as crizotinib is a
MET inhibitor as well (29). This could also be the case for the
patient mentioned in the article by Marchetti and colleagues (8),
although this was not evaluated.
We also showed that heterogeneous staining was only observed
in patients who did not respond to treatment. So, only those
patients respond effectively to ALK treatment who have a homo-
genously positive dichotomous ALK-IHC staining.
In conclusion, this is the largest report where dichotomous
ALK-IHC and FISH tests are evaluated in small biopsies and
cytology alone. Dichotomous ALK-IHC (either positive or
negative) outcome is superior to ALK-FISH on small biopsies
and FNA to predict tumor response and survival to anti-ALK
therapy for patients with advanced NSCLC. Our data strongly
suggest that guidelines should be adapted, and dichotomous
ALK-IHC should be the standard companion diagnostic test
to select patients with NSCLC who benefit from anti-ALK
therapy.
