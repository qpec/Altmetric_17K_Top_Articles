We aimed to examine the prospective association between first trimester HbA1c and gestational 
diabetes (GDM) and explore the utility of HbA1c for prediction of GDM. We used data from a case-
control study within the prospective NICHD Fetal Growth Studies-Singleton Cohort (2009–2013), which 
enrolled 2,802 women at 12 U.S. clinical centers. HbA1c was measured in GDM cases (n = 107) and 
matched controls (n = 214) targeted at 8–13, 16–22, 24–29, and 34–37 gestational weeks. We excluded 
women with HbA1c ≥ 6.5% (48 mmol/mol) at enrollment (n = 3) or who had a hemoglobin variant 
(n = 6). At 8–13 gestational weeks, women who later developed GDM had significantly higher HbA1c 
(5.3[standard deviation 0.3]%; 34[4]mmol/mol) than women without GDM (5.1[0.3]%; 32[3] mmol/
mol) (P ≤ 0.001); this difference remained significant throughout pregnancy. Each 0.1% (1 mmol/mol) 
HbA1c increase at 8–13 weeks was associated with an adjusted 22% increased GDM risk (95% confidence 
interval 1.09–1.36). First trimester HbA1c significantly improved GDM prediction over conventional 
risk factors (AUC 0.59 vs 0.65; P = 0.04). In conclusion, women who develop GDM may have impaired 
glucose homeostasis early in or prior to pregnancy, as indicated by their elevated first trimester HbA1c. 
First trimester HbA1c may aid in early identification of at risk women.
Gestational diabetes (GDM) is a common pregnancy complication associated with adverse maternal and fetal 
outcomes including an increased risk for type 2 diabetes and cardiovascular disease later in life in mothers and 
an increased risk for macrosomia and obesity in offspring1. A recent study reported that GDM associated fetal 
overgrowth starts early in pregnancy before diagnosis of GDM, potentially demonstrating a need to identify preg-
nancies with glucose intolerance earlier in pregnancy2. HbA1c, a measure of glycated hemoglobin which serves 
as an indicator of blood glucose control in the prior 3–4 months, may be an avenue for earlier identification of 
women at risk for GDM. However, while HbA1c is currently used among high-risk women at the first prenatal 
visit to identify women with overt type 2 diabetes, it is not currently used to screen for GDM.
A few prior studies have examined if HbA1c measured in the first trimester is useful for early predication of 
GDM3–6; however, these studies have been among high-risk populations only4,5, evaluated an HbA1c threshold 
only of 5.7% (39 mmol/mol), corresponding to prediabetes outside of pregnancy6, or used GDM diagnosed in 
the first trimester only as the outcome3. Other studies have focused primarily on HbA1c measured in the second 
trimester or at the time of GDM diagnosis7–9. Thus, research remains limited on HbA1c measured in the first 
trimester and its relation with GDM among a population based sample. This is particularly important as early 
risk prediction may offer a unique opportunity for earlier interventions. Furthermore, data is lacking presenting 
normal ranges for HbA1c across pregnancy.
This study aimed to comprehensively examine of HbA1c across pregnancy and its relation with GDM. The first 
aim was to profile the physiological variation in HbA1c across gestation and examine for differences in women 
with and without GDM. The second aim of this study was to prospectively evaluate the association between

HbA1c levels measured in the first trimester and subsequent risk for GDM diagnosis. The third exploratory aim 
of this study was to evaluate the predictive utility of using first trimester HbA1c to predict GDM and potentially 
identify an ideal cut-off for GDM screening in the first trimester.
Methods
Study sample. 
This study was based on a secondary analysis of a GDM case-control study using participants 
from the Eunice Kennedy Shriver National Institute of Child Health and Human Development (NICHD) Fetal 
Growth Studies-Singleton Cohort, with 2,334 low-risk, pregnancies among non-obese women and 468 pregnan-
cies among obese women (n = 2,802 in total)10.Women from four self-identified race-ethnic groups (non-His-
panic white, non-Hispanic black, Hispanic, and Asian/Pacific Islander) were enrolled between gestational weeks 
8–13 at 12 U.S. clinical centers (2009–2013). The primary aims of the NICHD Fetal Growth Study were to develop 
fetal growth standards and thus enrollment was restricted to non-obese women without preexisting chronic dis-
eases or medical conditions, including diabetes before pregnancy or GDM in a prior pregnancy, and without 
lifestyle risk factors including smoking (n = 2,334). A secondary aim was to examine the etiology of GDM and 
thus a supplemental cohort of obese women was also recruited (n = 468). The inclusion criteria were less restric-
tive for the obese cohort and included women who smoked prior to pregnancy, had a hematologic disorder, or 
had GDM in a prior pregnancy. Complete details on the inclusion criteria are detailed elsewhere10. Longitudinal 
questionnaire data and biospecimens were collected throughout pregnancy and medical record abstraction of 
routine prenatal exam results and delivery discharge diagnoses reports was completed after delivery. Institutional 
review board approval was obtained at all participating clinical sites (Christiana Care Health System, Columbia 
University, Fountain Valley, Long Beach Memorial Medical Center, Medical University of South Carolina, New 
York Hospital Queens, Northwestern University, St. Peter’s University Hospital, Tufts University, University of 
Alabama at Birmingham, University of California, Irvine, Women and Infants Hospital of Rhode Island), the data 
coordinating centers (Clinical Trials & Surveys Corporation and the Emmes Corporation), and the NICHD. All 
participants provided written, informed consent. All methods were performed in accordance with the relevant 
guidelines and regulations. The NICHD Fetal Growth Studies follows the data sharing policies of the NICHD and 
queries regarding data sharing may be sent to the corresponding author.
The current analysis is based on a nested GDM case-control study within the NCIHD Fetal Growth Studies, 
which included 107 GDM cases and 214 matched non-GDM controls. Two non-GDM controls were selected for 
each case and matched on maternal age (±2 years), race/ethnicity (non-Hispanic White, non-Hispanic Black, 
Hispanic, Asian/Pacific Islander), and gestational week of blood collection (±2 weeks). All analyses excluded 
participants with HbA1c ≥
 6.5% (48 mmol/mol) at enrollment (n = 3), as this is an indicator of overt type 2 diabe-
tes11. Furthermore, participants missing HbA1c measurements at all timepoints (n = 1), or who had an abnormal 
hemoglobin variant such as HbS, HbC, or HbE (n = 6) were excluded. Thus, the final analytic sample included 
100 GDM cases and 211 non-GDM controls.
GDM ascertainment. 
All women underwent standard clinical care which included a glucose challenge test 
and/or an oral glucose tolerance test (OGTT), as needed. GDM cases were identified by medical record review of 
the clinical OGTT results according to Carpenter and Coustan criteria, as currently endorsed by the American 
Diabetes Association (ADA) and the American College of Obstetrics and Gynecologists (ACOG), of at least two 
diagnostic plasma glucose measurements at or above the defined thresholds (fasting 5.3 mmol/l, 1-h 10.0 mmol/l, 
2-h 8.6 mmol/l, 3-h 7.8 mmol/l)12,13. Women without recorded OGTT results, but with ‘medication treated GDM’ 
recorded on the discharge diagnoses were considered as having GDM (n = 12). A total of 107 women with GDM 
were identified in the NICHD Fetal Growth Studies.
Blood Collection. 
Blood specimens were collected in all participants following a standardized protocol at 
enrollment at 8–13 gestational weeks and at three additional study visits targeted at weeks 16–22 (fasting), 24–29, 
and 34–37. The actual date range for the blood collection varied slightly due to some women coming in at a differ-
ent time for their blood draw than their regular study visit. At enrollment (8–13 gestational weeks), 99.7% of the 
blood draws were within the targeted range. At visit 1 (16–22 weeks), 91.0% of the blood draws were within the 
targeted range. At visit 2 (24–29 weeks), 90.3% of the blood draws were within the targeted range. No blood was 
collected at visit 3. At visit 4 (34–37 weeks), 89.2% of the blood draws were within the targeted range.
HbA1c measurements. 
HbA1c was measured in an EDTA whole blood sample that was stored at <−
70 °C 
and thawed immediately before analysis. HbA1c was measured using a non-porous ion Exchange High 
Performance Liquid Chromatography (HPLC) assay (Tosoh Automated Analyzer HLC-723G8, Tosoh Bioscience, 
Inc., South San Francisco, CA & Tokyo, Japan). The assay CV was less than 1.16%.
HbA1c was measured in blood collected at enrollment, visit 1, 2 and 4 in all GDM cases and one of the two 
matched controls. However, for the second of the two non-GDM controls, HbA1c was measured only in samples 
collected at enrollment and the first visit, before the time GDM is typically diagnosed.
Covariates. 
All women underwent a screening ultrasound at enrollment to confirm accurate dating of the 
pregnancy by last menstrual period, which was then used to calculate gestational weeks at each subsequent visit. 
At enrollment, women completed detailed questionnaires regarding their medical history and socio-demographic 
characteristics. Maternal height was measured, and pre-pregnancy weight was self-reported. Pre-pregnancy body 
mass index (BMI; kg/m2) was calculated and categorized as normal weight (18.5–24.9 kg/m2), overweight (25.0–
29.9 kg/m2), or obese (≥
30.0 kg/m2). Family history of diabetes was classified (yes/no) if a woman’s parents or 
siblings had diabetes. As part of the inclusion criteria for the main study (primary aim was to define a fetal growth 
standard), non-obese women who smoked, had GDM in a prior pregnancy or had a hematologic disorder (e.g., 
chronic anemia, sickle cell disease, low platelets, blood clotting problems) were not eligible for the study. The

inclusion criteria for obese women was less restrictive and obese women reported at enrollment their smoking 
habits in the 6 months prior to pregnancy (yes, no), if they had GDM in a prior pregnancy (yes, no), or if they had 
a hematologic disorder (yes, no). A three-level variable was created incorporating parity and prior GDM status 
(nulliparous/parous, no GDM/parous, prior GDM).
Statistical methods. 
The bivariate baseline characteristics of GDM cases and controls were compared using 
binomial/multinomial logistic regression with generalized estimating equations accounting for the matching fac-
tors between cases and controls.
HbA1c Profile Across Pregnancy. Longitudinal trajectories of the mean HbA1c levels across gestation were plotted 
by visit according to GDM status. Differences between GDM cases and controls were tested using linear mixed 
models.
Prospective Association between HbA1c and GDM Risk. We examined the prospective association between HbA1c 
measured in the first trimester and GDM risk as well as the change between HbA1c in the first and second tri-
mesters and GDM risk. We examined for, but did not detect a possible non-linear relation between HbA1c in 
the first trimester and the odds of GDM and thus used a linear model to assess the association between HbA1c 
and GDM14. The models were adjusted for maternal age (continuous), prepregnancy BMI (normal weight, over-
weight, obese), family history of diabetes (yes/no), and gestational week of blood collection (continuous). While 
maternal age and gestational week of blood collection were considered in the case-control matching, the match-
ing was not exact and thus we adjusted for these factors to further remove any residual confounding. We tested for 
an interaction between HbA1c and pre-pregnancy BMI status (normal weight, overweight, obese). Women with 
GDM diagnosed before the first trimester HbA1c measurement were excluded from the above analyses (n = 1).
Sensitivity analyses were performed excluding women who had GDM in a prior pregnancy (n = 5), women 
who had a hematologic disorder (n = 1), or obese women who smoked prior to pregnancy (n = 4).
Lastly, we examined for an association between the change in HbA1c from enrollment at 8–13 weeks to visit 1 
visit 2. These analyses excluded women with GDM diagnosed before enrollment (n = 1), visit 1 (n = 3) or visit 2 
(n = 25), as appropriate.
First Trimester HbA1c and GDM Prediction. We used a receiver-operating-characteristic (ROC) curves to evalu-
ate the predictive ability of HbA1c for GDM diagnosis. We used leave-one-out cross-validation to avoid overfitting 
the data with logistic regression models for ROC curves15. All models also accounted for the matched design in 
the case-control study by adjusting for the matching factors16. The following analyses excluded women with GDM 
diagnosed before the first trimester HbA1c measurement (n = 1).
First, we estimated the sensitivity and specificity of first trimester HbA1c by each 0.1% HbA1c increase from 
3.5% to 6.0% (15 to 42 mmol/mol). Confidence intervals around the sensitivity and specificity at each cutpoint 
were estimated using bootstrapping with 5000 repetitions, repeating the cross-validation for each repetition17. For 
each resampling repetition we identified the optimal HbA1c cutpoint which maximized accuracy of classification 
based on sensitivity and specific using the Youden index (sensitivity + [specificity-1])18. The overall suggested 
optimal point corresponded to the mode of the distribution of identified cutpoints across the 5000 replicates.
Second, we estimated the value of using HbA1c for prediction of GDM above and beyond conventional 
high-risk factors (i.e., maternal age, race-ethnicity, pre-pregnancy overweight or obesity, family history of diabe-
tes, GDM in a prior pregnancy, and nulliparity).
All analyses were conducted using SAS version 9.4 (SAS Institute, Cary, NC) and p-values < 0.05 were con-
sidered significant.
Results
The participant characteristics of the women with and without GDM are shown in Table 1. Women with GDM 
were more likely to be obese and have a family history of diabetes; as expected due to matching no differences 
between cases and controls were observed in race/ethnicity or age. At enrollment, 15.0% of GDM cases (n = 15) 
and 2.4% of non-GDM controls (n = 5) had an HbA1c level ≥
5.7%, corresponding to the cutpoint for prediabetes 
outside of pregnancy; this difference was not significantly different (P = 0.54).
HbA1c Profile Across Pregnancy. 
The longitudinal changes in HbA1c across gestation according to GDM 
status are shown in Fig. 1. HbA1c was significantly higher in GDM cases than controls throughout pregnancy 
(P < 0.03). Regardless of GDM status, HbA1c tended to decrease into the second trimester, and then increase 
around the third trimester.
Association between HbA1c and GDM Risk. 
There was a significant linear association between HbA1c 
at enrollment (8–13 weeks) and GDM risk (P = 0.001). HbA1c was associated with a significant increased risk of 
GDM such that compared to women with median HbA1c levels (5.2%; 33 mmol/mol), women with a first trimes-
ter HbA1c of 5.7% (39 mmol/mol) had a GDM risk of 2.73 (95% CI 1.59, 4.66) times higher (Table 2). The change 
in HbA1c levels between enrollment and visit 1 was not associated with GDM risk independent of HbA1c levels 
at enrollment. However, the change in HbA1c between enrollment and visit 2 was significantly and positively 
associated with GDM risk independent of HbA1c at enrollment (P = 0.04). Sensitivity analyses excluding obese 
women who smoked, had prior GDM, or a hematologic disorder yielded similar results [per 0.1% increase HbA1c: 
OR = 1.23 (95% CI 1.10, 1.38)].
First Trimester HbA1c and GDM Prediction. 
The sensitivity and specificity of HbA1c at enrollment (8–13 
weeks) for GDM is presented in Table 3. Sensitivity ranged from 96% (95% CI 91%, 100%) at an HbA1c level of

3.5% (15 mmol/mol) to 12% (95% CI 1%, 27%) at an HbA1c of 6.0% (42 mmol/mol). Specificity ranged from 
10% (95% CI 1%, 23%) at an HbA1c of 3.5% (15 mmol/mol) to 98% (95% CI 95%, 100%) at an HbA1c of 6.0% 
(42 mmol/mol). There was suggestion that the optimal HbA1c cutpoint was at 5.1% (32 mmol/mol) where the 
sensitivity was 47% (95% CI 34%, 60%) and the specificity was 79% (95% CI 62%, 88%). At an HbA1c of 5.7% 
(39 mmol/mol), corresponding to the cutoff for prediabetes outside of pregnancy, the sensitivity was 21% (95% 
CI 8%, 36%) and the specificity was 95% (95% CI 91%, 99%).
We observed significant improvement (P = 0.04) to the base prediction model based on conventional risk 
factors (age, race/ethnicity, pre-pregnancy overweight and obesity, family history of diabetes, GDM in a prior 
pregnancy, and nulliparity; AUC = 0.59) with the inclusion of HbA1c measured at enrollment (AUC = 0.65) 
(Supplementary Fig. S1).
Discussion
In this prospective study among women without pre-existing medical conditions, we systematically examined 
HbA1c measured across pregnancy starting in the first trimester and its relation with GDM risk. The risk of GDM 
increased in a profound linear fashion such that women with an HbA1c of 5.7% (39 mmol/mol) compared to 5.2% 
(33 mmol/mol) had an almost three times higher risk of developing GDM. Furthermore, we observed a signifi-
cant improvement in GDM prediction with the inclusion of first trimester HbA1c over conventional risk factors 
alone. Thus, even in this cohort of low-risk women without pre-existing medical conditions, HbA1c measured in 
the first trimester improved GDM prediction.
We examined the longitudinal trends in HbA1c levels across pregnancy among women who did and did not 
develop GDM. Women without GDM had lower first trimester HbA1c levels than women who went on to develop

GDM; however, both groups followed similar patterns across pregnancy; HbA1c decreased slightly from the first 
to the second trimester and then tended to increase in the third trimester. This is intuitive and in line with the 
high erythrocyte turnover in pregnancy19, and the decrease in insulin sensitivity with increasing gestation20. 
While our findings are similar to other studies, such as Nielsen et. al who reported that levels decreased between 
two measurements from early to later in pregnancy21, we provide longitudinal data across pregnancy to show 
the complete pattern in each trimester. Another study observed similar patterns across pregnancy, but each time 
point was based only on cross sectional measurements with one observation per participant22.
Outside of pregnancy, HbA1c has been shown to be a useful biomarker for diagnosing type 2 diabetes and 
monitoring glucose control among individuals with diabetes. Its current application in pregnancy has been lim-
ited to screening for overt type 2 diabetes and it remains unclear if it has utility for GDM screening. We observed 
that HbA1c provided a clinically meaningful improvement in GDM prediction over conventional high-risk fac-
tors with a 0.06-point improvement in the AUC. At the suggested ‘optimal’ cutpoint of 5.1% (32 mmol/mol), the 
sensitivity remained relatively low at 47% and the specificity was moderately high at 79%. This optimal cutpoint 
maximizes the effectiveness of the test, but may not be ideal for the sole purpose of GDM diagnosis given that 
we have existing diagnostics based on the OGTT and the purpose of measuring HbA1c would only be an earlier 
diagnosis. Nonetheless, at a cutpoint of 5.7% (39 mmol/mol), the current cutpoint for prediabetes outside of preg-
nancy, the sensitivity was 21%, but the specificity was very high at 95%, which is very similar to estimates reported 
in a prior study of 13% and 94%, respectively6. There are two important things to note from our findings. First, 
the low sensitivity at higher HbA1c levels suggests that HbA1c may not be a good substitute for a second trimester 
OGTT, which tests the acute response to the glucose challenge and how women respond to the increased insulin

resistant environment of late pregnancy. However, more importantly, the high specificity at 5.7% (39 mmol/mol) 
suggests that with this threshold few low-risk women, who otherwise would not receive early screening, would 
be incorrectly diagnosed by an elevated first trimester HbA1c level. This presents a unique opportunity for earlier 
interventions in these women which would be ideal as GDM is associated with adverse pregnancy outcomes such 
as macrosomia23. While it is plausible that with an earlier intervention these risks might be minimized, future 
studies evaluating early intervention based on elevated first trimester HbA1c are essential to determine its utility.
Another important finding of our study with biological relevance was that with increasing levels of HbA1c, 
GDM risk increased significantly and in a linear fashion. Because HbA1c reflects glucose levels in the prior two to 
three months, we interpret these results to suggest that hyperglycemia even within women without pre-pregnancy 
diabetes may be relevant for the development of GDM. This finding is in line with prior studies on preconception 
diet which have observed substantial increased risks for GDM with poor dietary quality, further supporting the 
hypothesis that preconception improvements in glucose function may aid in GDM prevention24. It is important to 
note, however, that as we make inferences from our findings to the preconception period, the findings from first 
trimester HbA1c could also reflect small changes in the first few weeks of pregnancy, therefore confirmation of 
preconception aberrations in HbA1c levels among women who develop GDM need to be verified in future studies.
One strength of our study was that HbA1c levels were measured among all women regardless of their clinical 
status. Some prior studies on HbA1c and GDM have been limited only to women who have an elevated risk for 
GDM at the start of their pregnancy. In accordance with current American Diabetes Association recommenda-
tions25, we considered women to have had overt diabetes if their first trimester HbA1c was ≥
6.5% (48 mmol/mol) 
and excluded them from our analyses. GDM screening and diagnosis was completed according to standard clin-
ical practice and the Carpenter and Coustan criteria were used to classify women with GDM after review of their 
medical records13. In addition, our study sample represented multiple race-ethnic groups from across the U.S., 
furthering the generalizability of our findings, although our findings may not be fully generalizable to women 
outside of the U.S. Also, HbA1c was measured according to the National Glycohemoglobin Standardization 
Program (NGSP) approved diagnostic test. We excluded participants identified as having hemoglobin variants 
(n = 6), for whom the TOSOH G7 does not perform well and HbA1c values can be underestimated26.
One limitation of our study was that the sample size was somewhat small at 321 participants (107 women with 
GDM and 214 matched controls), however, this was based on the larger underlying cohort of women from across 
the United States providing adequate power to address the research question. Nonetheless, the sample size did 
preclude us from creating training and confirmation datasets for our predication models. However, we applied

leave-one-out cross-validation to avoid overfitting the model. Nonetheless, inferences regarding GDM diagnos-
tics based on the ROC curves can only be treated as preliminary and require replication. In addition, the controls 
were matched to the GDM cases according to their age and race-ethnicity. While the matching was appropriately 
accounted for in our methods and the 6-point AUC difference between the models with and without HbA1c is 
valid, the overall AUC statistics are likely underestimated as the matching factors of age, race/ethnicity, which 
are strong risk factors for GDM, are not contributing to the AUC. Also, matching on all potential confounders is 
not possible, and therefore the cases and controls were imbalanced in regard to pre-pregnancy BMI and family 
history of diabetes, but this was accounted for through adjustment. Additionally, not all women had their blood 
drawn during the targeted window for each visit; however, for the enrollment visit, where the majority of our con-
clusions are based, 99.7% of data were within the targeted range and are considered first trimester measurements. 
Lastly, the NICHD Fetal Growth Studies inclusion criteria were restricted to women without major chronic dis-
eases and thus these results may not be generalizable to a high-risk population; however, early screening for overt 
type 2 diabetes is already completed in high risk women our findings suggest that even in low-risk women early 
dysfunction in glucose metabolism may be observed.
In conclusion, our comprehensive findings suggest potential important clinical utility of HbA1c measurement 
in the first trimester of pregnancy, even among low-risk women. While our findings require replication, GDM 
prediction was significantly improved with the inclusion of HbA1c over conventional risk factors suggesting that it 
could be used to improve early risk-stratification and screening in women with elevated levels. Furthermore, our 
findings suggest that hyperglycemia even among women without pre-pregnancy diabetes may be important for 
the development of GDM. These findings can be utilized to inform future intervention studies.
