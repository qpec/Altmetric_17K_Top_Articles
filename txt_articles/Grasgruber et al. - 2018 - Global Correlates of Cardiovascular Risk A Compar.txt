Abstract: The aim of this study was a large-scale ecological analysis of nutritional and other
environmental factors potentially associated with the incidence of cardiovascular diseases (CVDs)
in the global context. Indicators of CVDs from 158 countries were compared with the statistics of
mean intake (supply) of 60 food items between 1993 and 2011, obesity rates, health expenditure
and life expectancy. This comparison shows that the relationship between CVD indicators (raised
blood pressure, CVD mortality, raised blood glucose) and independent variables in the global
context is influenced by various factors, such as short life expectancy, religiously conditioned
dietary customs, the imprecision of some statistics and undernutrition. However, regardless of the
statistical method used, the results always show very similar trends and identify high carbohydrate
consumption (mainly in the form of cereals and wheat, in particular) as the dietary factor most
consistently associated with the risk of CVDs. These findings are in line with the changing view of the
causes of CVDs. Because only the statistics of raised blood glucose include people using medications
and reflect true prevalence that is independent of healthcare, more objective data on the prevalence
of CVDs are needed to confirm these observed trends.

1. Introduction
The view of the causes and prevention of cardiovascular diseases (CVDs) has been undergoing
fundamental changes during recent years. Meta-analyses of observational studies and available
clinical trials have not been able to find any reliable link between saturated fat and CVDs [1–7]
which has been the pillar of official nutritional guidelines for more than three decades. A decrease of
CVD prevalence/mortality occurs only when saturated fat is replaced by polyunsaturated fatty acids
(PUFAs) which is more likely to be related to the beneficial effects of PUFAs on blood lipid profiles,
rather than to any harmful role of saturated fat. Furthermore, even this conclusion was recently
questioned and attributed to methodological flaws [8]. On the other hand, we are witnessing growing
evidence of the fundamental roles of carbohydrates and high glycaemic index/load in the aetiology of
CVDs [1,2,9–12].
Nutritional guidelines perpetuating the connection between saturated fat and CVDs were first
introduced in the USA in 1977 and then in the United Kingdom in 1983 [13].
Although these
recommendations were officially based on various sources, a key inspirational role can be attributed to
the ‘Seven Countries Study’—an ecological research project that started in 1958 in seven countries of the
world, from the USA to Japan. As we explained in our previous paper [14], the authors of this research
concentrated on the statistics of coronary heart disease (CHD) mortality, without taking into account
the poor quality of diagnosis in some areas of the world. Although their data suggested a strongly

positive ecological correlation between CHD mortality and raised blood pressure, serum cholesterol and
saturated fat intake [15], their following study, published in 1990, found a strongly negative relationship
between stroke mortality and blood pressure/serum cholesterol [16]. Because the evidence from the
contemporary clinical trials (interventional studies) was conflicting and insufficient [13], nutritional
recommendations regarding saturated fat intake should have never been introduced.
During the last decade, more accurate and detailed statistical data on disease prevalence
became easily accessible from internet databases. Concurrently, an internet version of the Food
and Agriculture Organization Corporate Statistical Database (FAOSTAT) [17] enabled a mutual
comparison of international statistics of food supply from which mean food consumption rates can
be inferred. The FAOSTAT statistics of food supply are defined as ‘the total quantity of foodstuffs
produced in a country added to the total quantity imported and adjusted to any change in stocks
that may have occurred since the beginning of the reference period’.
Thus, they express food
availability (food disappearance) in a country within a given year and inevitably overestimate true
food consumption, because a certain proportion of food is wasted, consumed by foreigners, animals,
etc. However, in our own research, we observed that the FAOSTAT statistics of annual per capita
food supply produced very impressive and meaningful findings, especially in relation to the basic
components of diet (fat, protein, carbohydrates). For example, the correlation between male height in
93 countries and four animal proteins of the highest quality reached r = 0.84 (p < 0.001) [18].
With regard to such results, it is surprising that these statistics are still insufficiently utilized in
nutrition science, because the currently used methodologies have very serious limitations. Most of the
available knowledge comes from long-term observational studies that follow large samples of people
for several decades, but their data are based on the self-reported consumption of selected food items.
These studies, therefore, often produce unreliable and conflicting results. Controlled interventional
(clinical) studies, which prescribe a specific diet and can establish causality, are very demanding and
time-limited. In contrast, ecological (country-level) studies use official statistics that are available for a
long period of time, and their accuracy can be far superior to self-reported information.
In our recent study dealing with food consumption and the prevalence of cardiovascular diseases
(CVDs) in 42 European countries [14], we further verified the usefulness of this methodology and
found biologically relevant correlations reaching up to r = 0.92 (p < 0.001)—a value that has hardly
any analogy in the epidemiological literature. Although even strong ecological findings of this sort
cannot conclusively establish causality at the individual level, they can be used as a starting point of
medical hypotheses, and their validity can be supported by studies using different methodologies.
The combination of different types of studies may therefore strengthen each other’s results, which is of
key importance in a complicated field such as dietology. In this concrete case, our results agreed with
the changing view of the causes of CVDs and pointed to high-glycaemic carbohydrates as the major
CVD trigger. Distilled alcoholic beverages and sunflower oil emerged as other possible risk factors.
In contrast, total fat and animal fat consumption were the most frequent negative correlates of CVD
indicators, and additional statistics further highlighted high-fat dairy products (cheese), fruits (mainly
oranges and mandarins) and tree nuts.
Because the ‘Seven Countries Study’ showed that the misapplication of ecological data can be a
serious issue that undermines the very basis of this approach, particular attention should be paid to
their accuracy. Furthermore, a traditional flaw of ecological studies conducted in the past was the use
of a limited number of geographically and culturally incompatible countries, with a similarly limited
number of independent variables that can be influenced by hidden confounding factors. Therefore,
a well-conducted ecological study should utilize the maximum number of potentially significant
variables and, if possible, it should compare the consistency of results across different regions and
time periods.
In the present study, we expand our research of ecological correlates of CVDs to the rest of
the world, using health and food statistics from 158 countries. Although the accuracy of data from
developing countries may be lower, we hoped that the results would be consistent across different

regions, and if they confirmed our findings from Europe, the support for their causal relationship with
CVDs would further increase.
2. Methods
2.1. Statistics of Food Consumption
Similar to our previous study, we collected data on the mean food consumption (supply) from
the FAOSTAT database [18] for the period 1993–2011 (in grams/day per capita). Our aim was to
include as many food items from the FAOSTAT database as possible, but to limit spurious correlations,
the minimum mean consumption was set at 5 grams/day. Data on some food items were missing in
certain countries, but when their consumption rate in neighbouring countries was zero or close to zero,
or when the data were apparently missing because of cultural reasons (the prohibition on alcohol and
pork in Muslim countries), it was assumed that the consumption in the respective country is zero.
Fourteen food items (bananas, barley, cassava, grapefruit, lemons and limes, millet, onions,
palm oil, pineapples, rye, sorghum, soybean oil, sweet potatoes, yams) had sufficiently high mean
consumption rates, but were missing from too many countries for their consumption to be determined
reliably. Therefore, these food items were excluded from the analysis. The data on oranges and
mandarins were missing only in Myanmar.
Given the important role of this food item in our
previous study, the mean intake in Myanmar was estimated and computed as a mean of five
neighbouring countries.
Altogether, the study included 60 food items. Fourteen of them were basic indicators of fat and
protein intake, or their combinations (animal fat, animal protein, animal fat and animal protein, total
energy, etc.). Another six basic indicators of the energy proportion were computed by us: % energy
from carbohydrates in cereals (% CC energy), % energy from carbohydrates in starchy roots (% SRC
energy), the combination of % CC energy and % SRC energy, % energy from carbohydrates and alcohol
(% CA energy), % energy from alcoholic beverages (% alcoholic beverages energy), % plant food energy
(excluding alcoholic beverages). Because the FAOSTAT database lists only information on fat and
protein intake, the proportion of energy from carbohydrates was derived from fat and protein energy,
assuming 9.0 kcal per gram of fat and 4.1 kcal per gram of protein.
Sixteen items designated the major food groups (e.g., alcoholic beverages, cereals, fruits, etc.).
The remaining 24 items consisted of individual foods. Although their mean daily intakes are mostly
low and are more likely to be tied to various confounders, their inclusion is definitely worthwhile,
because they can potentially support results of studies based on different methodologies. The most
important of them are wheat (198 g/day), potatoes (100 g/day), rice and beer (both 79 g/day).
2.2. Health Statistics
Health statistics were collected from the website of the World Health Organization (WHO) [19].
In some cases, there were differences in definitions, when compared with the data from Nichols et al.
(for 2008) [20,21] which we used in our previous paper dealing with 42 European countries [14].
The statistics of raised blood pressure in the WHO database correlate very strongly with the data
from Nichols et al. [20] (r = 0.81 in men, r = 0.93 in women; p < 0.001), but the difference is large enough
to indicate that different sources or different methodologies were used (Figures S1 and S2). Because
these WHO statistics are defined as the “age-standartized prevalence of raised blood pressure (systolic
≥140 or diastolic ≥90 mmHg) in adults aged >18 years”, they include a younger population, and they
do not include people using blood pressure-lowering medications, which is also emphasized in the
paper from which the input data were drawn [22]. As a result, the prevalence in Europe by WHO
is lower by ~16% in men and ~17% in women, on average. Interestingly, the data of Nichols et al.
correlate more strongly with food consumption in Europe, e.g., with total fat and animal protein
(Figures S3–S6).
 Nutrients 2018, 10, 411

The statistics of the prevalence of raised cholesterol listed by Nichols et al. [20], which we
used in our previous study dealing with CVDs in Europe, were also taken from the WHO database,
as evidenced by the perfect correlation of both sources in both sexes (r = 1.00).
The data on CVD mortality in 42 European countries from Nichols et al. [21] are highly concordant
with the statistics of CVD mortality by WHO (for 2012) (r = 0.95 in men, r = 0.93 in women;
p < 0.001). However, there is a striking outlier—Georgia—in both sexes, and Albania in women
(Figures S7 and S8). Remarkably, Georgia was also an outlier in all comparisons, including CVD
mortality, in our previous study [14]. This strongly suggests that Nichols et al. underestimated CVD
mortality in these two countries. Indeed, if we substitute the data of Nichols et al. with the WHO
statistics, the correlation of total fat and animal protein with CVD mortality increases from r = −0.73 to
r = −0.81 in men, and from r = −0.81 to r = −0.87 in women.
The data on the prevalence of raised blood glucose in 42 European countries from
Nichols et al. [20] (for 2008) do not agree particularly well with the statistics of raised blood glucose
from WHO (for 2010) (r = 0.65 in men, r = 0.86 in women; p < 0.001) (Figures S9 and S10). The statistics
of WHO are defined as “the percent of the defined population with fasting glucose ≥126 mg/dL
(7.0 mmol/L) or a history of diagnosis with diabetes or use of insulin or oral hypoglycaemic drugs”
in the age category of >18 years. The statistics from Nichols et al. are defined as “the estimate of
raised fasting blood glucose (≥7.0 mmol/L) or patients on medication (%)” in the age category of
>25 years. This suggests that the methodology of data collection is not very different, but due to the
targeting of higher age groups, the prevalence reported by Nichols et al. might be somewhat higher
(which is indeed the case). Still, the statistics of WHO show stronger and very impressive correlations
with nutrition in Europe, especially with % CC energy and % SRC energy (r = 0.72 in men, r = 0.92 in
women) or total fat (r = −0.72 in men, r = −0.88 in women; p < 0.001).
2.3. Socioeconomic Statistics
The data on health expenditure, GDP (gross domestic product) per capita and life expectancy
were obtained from the World Bank [23]. Not all these data were available from all countries. Therefore,
a reasonable compromise must have been made between the number of examined variables and the
number of included countries. Eventually, eight variables were selected. This means that together
with the FAOSTAT statistics, there were nine factors in the main analysis that were available from
158 countries (Table 1; for complete statistics, see Supplementary dataset, Sheets S1–S3). The GDP
per capita was not used in the study because its inclusion would decrease this number to 155, and it
is very strongly associated with health expenditure per capita (r = 0.85, p < 0.001) which is a more
meaningful correlate (confounder) of health statistics. The statistics of physical activity and smoking
prevalence were largely incomplete, but due to their importance, they were analyzed independently,
in samples of 123 and 115 countries, respectively.

2.4. Statistical Analyses
Altogether, the main statistical analysis included 68 variables: 60 food items, six health indicators
divided by sex (raised blood cholesterol, CVD mortality, raised blood pressure, raised blood glucose,
obesity, mean BMI (Body mass index), health expenditure per capita and life expectancy divided
by sex. Statistical analyses were performed using the software SPSS Statistics 24.0.(IBM, Inc., Armonk,
NY, USA) Raised blood cholesterol, CVD mortality, raised blood pressure and raised blood glucose
were selected as the main dependent variables in the study. The correlates of life expectancy, obesity
and BMI will be examined in detail in a separate paper.
At first, we calculated simple (unadjusted) Pearson linear correlations with the total sample
of 158 countries.
To examine the consistency of findings across different parts of the world,
Pearson linear correlations were also computed in Europe (42 countries), the world outside Europe
(116 countries), North Africa/Asia/Oceania (47 countries), America (29 countries) and Sub-Saharan
Africa (40 countries). Considering that the WHO database does not indicate the quality of data,
a similar comparison was performed with countries divided according to health expenditure per
capita: above 500 USD, above 1000 USD, between 500–2000 USD and above 2000 USD. In the case of
raised blood pressure and CVD mortality, we also computed partial correlations adjusted for the most
likely confounding factors (health expenditure, smoking) in a multiple regression. Eventually, Pearson
linear correlations were performed even with the health indicators, which were not incorporated in the
main analysis because of missing data from multiple countries (physical activity, smoking prevalence).
Subsequently, a factor analysis with all 68 variables (or 75 variables, respectively, when the
division by sex is taken into account) was performed. The factor analysis groups variables according to
certain similar characteristics (factors) and graphically visualizes their mutual relationships in two- or
three-dimensional plots. This solves a whole range of problems associated with multicollinearity—the
key statistical problem in the present study.
Other tools that we used for the reduction of multicollinearity were the ridge regression, LASSO
(least absolute shrinkage and selection operator) regression and elastic net regression. These regression
methods are aimed at identifying the best predictors out of a set of variables that are mutually highly
correlated. They work with all independent variables at once and are based on the penalization
(artificial lowering) of beta regression coefficients. The changing size of the penalization creates
different models with different prediction errors, and a model with the lowest prediction error (ideally
using low penalization) is selected as optimal. In the results of the ridge regression, all variables are
ranked according to the size of their beta coefficients. The LASSO regression is more selective and
with increasing penalization, it shrinks beta coefficients in the majority of variables to zero. The elastic
net regression is basically a combination of these two methods [24]. In all cases, optimal models
 Nutrients 2018, 10, 411
6 of 39
with the lowest prediction errors were used, computed via the bootstrapping method. Bootstrapping
works with random combinations of independent variables with replacement, creates many additional
models for each penalization level, and then also computes their mean result. This helps to eliminate
various anomalies (for a more detailed explanation, see SPSS Statistics version 24.0, ibm.com).
Finally, we performed an analogy of fixed-effects models and examined temporal changes in the
relationship between the actual CVD incidence and food consumption in single years. This procedure
can potentially identify a time period that was critical for the development of CVDs. In addition,
it can also reveal long-term collinearity between some food items which would help in identifying
confounding factors. The inter-item collinearity was examined via the regression slope test that
compares the slope of two regression trend lines. The higher the probability value (p-value) in this test,
the more two trend lines run parallel to each other [25].
3. Results
3.1. Pearson Linear Correlations
Detailed results of the Pearson linear correlations are presented in Tables 2–5 and in Tables S1–S8.
Partial (adjusted) correlations of raised blood pressure and CVD mortality are displayed in Table 6.
3.1.1. Raised Blood Pressure
The prevalence of raised blood pressure is the highest in men from Eastern Europe and
Sub-Saharan Africa, and in women from Sub-Saharan Africa. The men’s and women’s values quite
strongly correlate (r = 0.69, p < 0.001), but the prevalence in men from less developed countries of Asia,
Africa and America does not differ from that in women. This contrasts with the situation in Europe
and in some other highly developed countries (USA, Japan, South Korea, Israel etc.) where men have a
much higher prevalence of raised blood pressure than women (Figure 1). As a result, the correlation
between raised blood pressure and CVD mortality is much weaker in men (r = 0.42, p < 0.001) than in
women (r = 0.69, p < 0.001) (Figure 2A,B).
The explanation for this discrepancy may lie in the substantially shorter life expectancy of men
relative to women, particularly in the former USSR republics (Figure S11). In other words, many men
in certain countries do not reach the critical age when this CVD indicator starts to manifest itself.
In any case, men’s statistics of raised blood pressure do not correlate with CVD mortality in America
and Sub-Saharan Africa (Table 2). Their relationships with food consumption are also quite weak
(compare Figure 3A,B), and in Sub-Saharan Africa, they even tend to go in the opposite direction than
in women. Therefore, whatever the reason, men’s statistics appear to be less credible. However, if we
are to identify any meaningful factor that influences men’s global statistics, it is apparently alcohol,
particularly in its distilled form (Figures S12 and S13). In fact, the drinking distilled alcohol is probably
indirectly reflected even by the natural substrates of its home production in Eastern Europe (starchy
roots, % SRC energy, potatoes) which are themselves sources of high-glycaemic carbohydrates.
Table 3 shows that women’s raised blood pressure has the strongest positive correlation with
the proportion of carbohydrate energy coming from cereals and starchy roots (r = 0.69, p < 0.001)
(Figure 3B), followed by % plant food energy (r = 0.64, p < 0.001) and % energy from carbohydrates
and alcohol (r = 0.62, p < 0.001) (Figure 3C). Even after adjusting for health expenditure, these food
items remain some of the few that have a significantly positive relationship with women’s raised blood
pressure (Table 6). Cereals make up the largest proportion in the diet of the tropical belt of Asia and in
Sub-Saharan Africa (Figure 3D). Starchy roots are consumed mainly in Sub-Saharan Africa (Figure 3E).
These findings thus go in the same direction as those from our previous study in which we observed a
link between CVD and high carbohydrate consumption [14].

Interestingly, the nations of South and East Asia have a disproportionately lower prevalence
of raised blood pressure, despite a high proportion of cereals in their diet and irrespective of their
economic prosperity. For example, Japan and South Korea have a similar prevalence to ‘Western’
nations with a two-fold lower proportion of energy from cereal carbohydrates. Figure 3F shows that
all these Asian nations consume cereals in the form of rice, whereas others consume them mostly as
wheat and maize (Figures S14 and S15).
The strongest negative correlates of women’s raised blood pressure are displayed in Figure 4A–D:
raised cholesterol (r = −0.73) and animal protein (r = −0.71) among nutrition-related variables, and life
expectancy (r = −0.79) with health expenditure (r = −0.71, p < 0.001) among socioeconomic statistics.
All these results are again similar to those from Europe, but the global connection between raised
blood pressure and raised cholesterol is now even slightly stronger, and the main negative dietary
correlate in Europe was total fat and animal protein. At the same time, the correlation of raised
blood pressure with health expenditure has a strikingly different shape than those for the other three
variables. In addition, each of these three variables retains high significance after adjusting for health
expenditure (p < 0.001) (Table 6). This minimizes the possibility that health expenses could work as a
significant confounding factor.

The strongly negative relationship between raised blood pressure and life expectancy indirectly
indicates that women’s statistics of raised blood pressure reflect very well the prevalence of CVDs
which are the major cause of death worldwide [26]. In contrast, we do not find such a strong
relationship in men (r = −0.39, p < 0.001), and the graphic comparisons show quite convincingly
that men’s statistics of raised blood pressure in developing countries are deeply underestimated,
especially in Sub-Saharan Africa (Figures S16 and S17).
3.1.2. Raised Cholesterol
The strongest nutritional predictors of raised cholesterol in the present study are very similar
to those observed in Europe [14]: animal fat and animal protein (r = 0.89 in men, r = 0.85 in women;
p < 0.001) (Figure 5A) and % plant food energy (r = −0.84 in men, r = −0.80 in women; p < 0.001)
(Figure 5B). These exceptional results have a very solid biological basis, because saturated fat from
animal sources is the main trigger of total cholesterol, whereas carbohydrates (coming overwhelmingly
from plant sources) decrease it the most [27]. Total cholesterol thus largely expresses the proportion of
animal food in the diet. It also follows that the statistics of raised cholesterol can be regarded as very
reliable, and they can be used as one of the key pillars of this study.

3.1.3. Cardiovascular Mortality
The highest rates of CVD mortality in men occur in the former USSR republics and Central
Asia, but even in Egypt, Iraq and Guyana. In women, Central Asia is by far the most affected region.
In general, the relationships between CVD mortality and exogenous factors are substantially weaker
than in the case of raised blood pressure, although the trends are similar. The strongest positive
correlates are cereals and raised blood pressure in men (both r = 0.43), and raised blood pressure in
 Nutrients 2018, 10, 411
20 of 39
women (r = 0.69, p < 0.001). Out of all dietary factors, % CC energy and % SRC energy in women reach
the highest r–values (r = 0.58, p < 0.001) (Figure 6A). Another important factor that could explain the
strikingly high CVD mortality in Central Asia is high salt intake, but these statistics are still based only
on rough estimates from a limited number of countries [28].

(D) Relationship between women’s CVD mortality (WHO, 2012) and health expenditure per capita for

Total fat and animal protein, which have a very impressive negative relationship to CVD mortality
in Europe, even higher than health expenditure (Tables 2 and 3), show only moderate r-values in the
total sample (r = −0.30 in men, r = −0.54 in women; p < 0.001) because CVD mortality in non-European
countries is lower than expected from the European trend line (Figure 6B). As a result, the list of
global negative correlates in both sexes is dominated by the indicator of healthcare–health expenditure
(r = −0.43 in men, r = −0.59 in women; p < 0.001) (Figure 6C,D). Although the adjustment for health
expenditure completely erases the significance of total fat and animal protein in women (p = 0.21),
that of % CC energy and % SRC energy is retained (p < 0.001), and wheat reaches the highest partial
correlation, followed by cereals (Table 6). Similar to Europe, health expenses above 2000 USD per
capita do not bring any additional benefits, but reduced CVD mortality in highly developed countries
(e.g., Luxembourg, Ireland) obviously blurs relationships with certain food items, such as alcohol,
that are otherwise associated weakly positively with raised blood pressure (Figures S18 and S19).
Figures S20–S23 display correlations of CVD mortality with raised cholesterol (r = −0.24 in men,
p = 0.003; r = −0.52 in women, p < 0.001) and life expectancy (r = −0.33 in men, r = −0.54 in women;
p < 0.001) which are also lower than in raised blood pressure. At the same time, we can clearly observe
disproportionately lower rates of CVD mortality outside Europe, especially in Sub–Saharan Africa.
Understandably, the statistics of CVD mortality in developing countries are distorted because of the
much higher premature mortality from other causes (infectious diseases, malnutrition, violence, etc.),
but this fact does not explain why life expectancy correlates more strongly with CVD prevalence
(raised blood pressure). Therefore, these results are somewhat puzzling and raise doubts about the
quality of CVD mortality statistics. Indeed, with growing health expenditure (and hence increasing
data accuracy), this relationship starts to reverse. Among the 31 countries with health expenditure
above 2000 USD per capita, the correlation between CVD mortality and life expectancy increases up to
 Nutrients 2018, 10, 411
22 of 39
r = −0.84 in men and r = −0.82 in women (p < 0.001), whereas in the case of raised blood pressure vs.
life expectancy, it is much lower (r = −0.43, p = 0.015 in men; r = −0.54, p = 0.002 in women). It is also
noteworthy that CVD mortality in Sub-Saharan Africa does not correlate with a single variable in men
and does so with only three variables in women. In contrast, the data on raised blood pressure often
come from internationally sponsored nationwide surveys (e.g., WHO-sponsored STEPS surveys [22]),
and despite their persisting imperfection, they should be more trustworthy.
3.1.4. Raised Blood Glucose
In the global comparison, raised blood glucose is the most common factor in Muslim, Pacific and
Caribbean countries. It is most strongly associated with indicators of obesity, such as high BMI (r = 0.40
in men, r = 0.62 in women; p < 0.001) (Figure 7A) and with the consumption of cereals (r = 0.35 in men,
r = 0.40 in women; p < 0.001) (Figure 7B), especially in the form of wheat (r = 0.43 in men, r = 0.31 in
women; p < 0.001). Total energy intake from cereal carbohydrates (CC energy), which was not included
among the independent variables in this study, produces very similar correlations (r = 0.36 in men,
r = 0.44 in women; p < 0.001). These results are not surprising because the links between raised blood
glucose, obesity, type 2 diabetes and CVDs are well established [29]. High-glycaemic foods, such as
refined cereals, fit into this context as well.

(E) Relationship between women’s raised blood glucose (%; WHO, 2010) and women’s raised blood
pressure (%; WHO, 2010); (F) Relationship between women’s raised blood glucose (%; WHO, 2010)
and the mean consumption of animal fat (g/day per capita; FAOSTAT, 1993–2011).
The strongest negative correlates of raised blood glucose are alcoholic beverages and pork, which
is a finding that makes little sense at first glance. However, it is easy to explain, when we realize that
both these foods are prohibited in Muslim countries, who consume the highest amount of cereals
in the world and suffer from very high rates of obesity. Inevitably, zero consumption of alcoholic
beverages and pork is linked to the highest rates of raised blood glucose. Therefore, it is a purely
spurious correlation (Figures S24 and S25).
Outside Europe, the proportion of energy from carbohydrate sources correlates either neutrally or
weakly negatively with raised blood glucose. Consequently, the relationship between these factors and
raised blood glucose is only slightly positive in the global comparison (Figure 7C). The explanation for
this paradox lies in the fact that outside Europe, the proportion of carbohydrates in the diet increases
with malnutrition and poverty. Some countries, such as Afghanistan, Bangladesh, Cambodia and Laos,
consume >60% of total energy intake in the form of cereal carbohydrates, but they otherwise suffer from
malnutrition and a very low caloric intake (Figure 7D). This means that their absolute intake of cereals
is only moderate, and due to widespread undernutrition, the prevalence of obesity is very low. As a
result, these countries have a rather low prevalence of blood glucose, but not necessarily blood pressure
(Figure 7E). If we consider only wealthier, well-nourished countries with health expenditure above
500 USD, the correlation coefficients increase dramatically (compare Figures S26–S29). For example,
the importance of animal fat disproportionately grows from r = −0.12 to −0.53 in men and from
r = −0.35 to r = −0.70 in women (Figure 7F, Figures S28 and S29).
In summary, raised blood glucose manifests in relatively wealthy countries, where the absolute
intake of energy from cereals is high and, in addition, the rates of obesity are high as well. Its low
prevalence has no clear common denominator because it is associated with high fat intake (in Europe
 Nutrients 2018, 10, 411
24 of 39
and highly developed countries in general) on one hand, and undernutrition/low obesity rates in
developing countries on the other hand.
3.2. Pearson Linear Correlations in Items with Insufficient Data
This comparison primarily concerns smoking prevalence, which is available for 115 countries
(Tables S9 and S10). Remarkably, in this limited sample (Table 7), current smoking of any tobacco
product is the strongest positive correlate of men’s CVD mortality out of all variables examined (r = 0.53,
p < 0.001), followed by raised blood pressure, cereals and wheat. Wheat retains high significance
(p < 0.001) even after adjusting for health expenditure and smoking rates (Table 6), and markedly
improves a regression model based on the current smoking of any tobacco product and health
expenditure (from adj. r2 = 0.389 to adj. r2 = 0.497). Furthermore, daily smoking of any tobacco
product approaches significance as a correlate of men’s raised blood pressure (r = 0.18, p = 0.054).
In contrast with men, women’s smoking prevalence correlates negatively with CVD risk, especially
current smoking of cigarettes (r = −0.48, p < 0.001 with raised blood pressure; r = −0.40, p < 0.001
with CVD mortality). As already explained in our previous paper [14], this sex-related discrepancy in
results must be ascribed to the much lower smoking prevalence in women (11.5%) than in men (34.1%),
combined with the fact that women smoke mainly in wealthy countries with the high occurrence of
factors that emerge as protective (compare Figures S30–S33).
These results show that smoking is a very significant confounder of CVD mortality in men, but
not in women. In fact, current smoking of cigarettes is the strongest and most robust correlate of men’s
CVD mortality in 39 European countries (r = 0.86, p < 0.001). However, these relationships are much
weaker outside Europe, despite a comparably high smoking prevalence. For example, the association
between men’s CVD mortality and the current smoking of any tobacco product in 76 non-European
countries is relatively negligible (r = 0.36, p = 0.002). This case again supports the idea that men’s CVD
statistics from non-European countries should be viewed as problematic. In any case, adjusting for
health expenditure and smoking highlights alcohol and potatoes as the dietary factors most strongly
associated with men’s CVD risk (Table 6).
Besides the negative role in relation to CVDs, smoking can also contribute to a lower prevalence
of obesity which is an effect notoriously known from observational studies [30]. This explains why
low rates of men’s obesity were positively tied with CVD risk in Europe in our previous paper (unlike
women’s obesity) [14]. In the present study, current smoking of any tobacco product has only a slightly
negative relationship with men’s obesity (r = −0.10, p = 0.31), and has a weak, positive correlation
with obesity rates in women (r = 0.33, p < 0.001) which further illustrates the insignificance of women’s
smoking as a health indicator at the ecological level.
The frequency of physical activity was self-reported and available from 123 countries. It is also
a very generalized and ambiguous term. In theory, the percentage of physically inactive men and
women should correlate positively with CVD risk, but the opposite is true (Table S11). However,
Figures S34 and S35 show that a slight positive tendency of this sort may exist in Muslim countries,
which have the highest levels of physical inactivity in the world and the highest rates of obesity.

3.3. Consistency of Findings across Regions, Sex and Health Expenditure Level
If we compare the frequency of significant correlates across five predefined regions in both sexes
(see Tables 2 and 3), carbohydrate intake (primarily from cereals and wheat in particular) is always
most consistently associated with the risk of raised blood pressure and CVD mortality (Table 8).
In the case of raised blood glucose, indicators of obesity occupy first place, followed by refined sugar
and wheat.

As already shown above, health expenditure is an unlikely confounder of raised blood pressure.
The fact that it is the most consistent correlate (nine times) must be ascribed to the eccentrically high
health expenses in highly developed countries which create significantly negative, but visually weak
correlations across multiple regions. Furthermore, state-organized activities aimed at CVD prevention
routinely have a limited effect [31] and usually target smoking, alcohol and the lowering of blood
cholesterol (via the decrease of saturated fat intake), which is at best questionable, because saturated
fat actually improves key CVD parameters, such as HDL (high-density lipoprotein)-cholesterol and
triglyceride levels [27]. All these lifestyle changes would also be reflected in our data and could not
work as hidden confounding factors.
The comparison of countries divided according to health expenses (Tables 4 and 5) shows similar
trends, with a single eccentric exception in the category 500–2000 USD per capita where animal
products (especially dairy) appear among the strongest positive correlates, together with potatoes,
alcoholic beverages and sunflower oil. In most categories, we also observe a positive connection
of CVD risk with distilled beverages (in men) and sunflower oil (in both sexes) which resembles
our results in Europe. These positive correlations are apparently driven only by European countries
in which the consumption of these two food items reaches a sufficient level (Figures S12, S13, S18,
S19 and S36–S39).
In the age category above 2000 USD per capita, very few significant correlations can be found.
This is mainly due to the outlier positions of Japan and South Korea that consume more carbohydrate
 Nutrients 2018, 10, 411
27 of 39
sources than other developed countries, but achieve the same CVD statistics.
Because health
expenditure above 2000 USD per capita has only a negligible effect on CVD mortality, it would
be interesting to examine what variables come to the foreground within the 31 countries in this group.
Twenty-three of these countries are from Europe, six from North Africa, Asia and Oceania, and two
from America. Although the r-values are not always significant, the order of variables is clearer and
more meaningful than in the total sample—with raised blood pressure, raised blood glucose and
carbohydrate sources as positive correlates, and life expectancy, fat, protein and major animal products
as negative correlates (Table 9).

Adjusted partial correlations (Table 6) show that men’s raised blood pressure is most strongly
associated with alcohol, and men’s CVD mortality with potatoes, but the foodstuffs most consistently
correlated with men’s CVD risk are potatoes, sunflower oil and dairy products. In women, only %
CC energy and % SRC energy and plant protein always retain significance. Besides that, we observe
a sex-related discrepancy similar to the category of health expenditure of 500–2000 USD per capita,
with animal products correlating positively with men’s CVD risk, but negatively with women’s risk.
However, there are several foodstuffs that reach significance in both sexes, and the direction of their
relationship is the same. Above all, it is fruits and rice that correlate negatively with all eight dependent
variables. Oranges and mandarins, and fish and seafood reach seven significant correlations. The most
consistent positive correlate is sunflower oil (seven-times), followed by wheat, potatoes and milk
(six-times).
3.4. Factor Analysis
Factor analyses are perhaps the best tool for the examination of multicollinearity, because they can
graphically visualize mutual relationships among a large amount of variables. They were performed
with 75 variables and all 158 countries. Factor 1 explains the largest proportion of variability (33.7%)
and divides the countries according to the consumption of fat/protein/animal foods (which are
accompanied by low CVD risk) and carbohydrates/plant foods (which are accompanied by high
 Nutrients 2018, 10, 411
28 of 39
CVD risk) (Figure 8). These extremes are represented by countries, such as Iceland, Spain and Finland
on one hand, and Malawi, Sierra Leone and Madagascar on the other (Figure 9).
Figure 8. Factor analysis including 75 variables in 158 countries (Factor 1 vs. Factor 2) explaining 40.9%
variability; Abbreviations: % CC energy = the mean proportion of carbohydrate energy from cereals;
% SRC energy = the mean proportion of carbohydrate energy from starchy roots; % CA energy = the
mean proportion of energy from carbohydrates and alcohol.
Factor 2 explains 7.2% variability and divides the countries mainly according to the consumption
of alcoholic beverages/pork/starchy roots on one hand, and cereals/women’s obesity on the
other hand. The first extreme is represented especially by Luxembourg, the USA and the Netherlands,
and the second extreme by Muslim countries (Tajikistan, Turkmenistan, Uzbekistan). As a result, Factor
2 highlights the main food items linked to high CVD risk in the Northeastern section of Figure 8: cereals
and a high proportion of carbohydrates in the diet. The opposite, Southwestern section is dominated
 Nutrients 2018, 10, 411
29 of 39
by a diet typical of wealthy ‘Western’ countries, consisting of animal products, alcohol and fruits,
accompanied by high health expenditure. However, long life expectancy is more closely associated
with food items such as dairy products, lean meat (poultry), eggs, refined sugar and sweeteners,
various plant fat sources, and generally a high consumption of fat and protein.
Figure 9. Projection of 158 countries on the factor plane of Figure 8.
Factor 3 explains only 4.8% variability (Figure 10). The Southeastern part of the graph highlights
countries with high CVD mortality/high prevalence of raised blood pressure, but only a moderate/low
prevalence of raised blood glucose (Figure 11). This combination is typical of many poor developing
countries with a high proportion of carbohydrates in the diet, but otherwise suboptimal nutrition,
as already shown in Figure 7C,D. The opposite, Northwestern part of the graph includes a diet rich in
fruits, meat, eggs, coffee, refined sugar and sweeteners, and plant fat sources. This food composition
is again typical mainly of the wealthiest countries of the Western world, but partly even East Asia,
the Near East and Latin America. These countries are also characterized by high life expectancy,
high health expenditure and higher rates of obesity.

= the mean proportion of energy from carbohydrates and alcohol.
Additional factor analyses are displayed in Figures S40–S45. When only 92 wealthier countries
with health expenses above 500 USD per capita are selected (Figures S40 and S41), the position of
individual items is apparently closer to the situation that we previously documented in Europe, with a
‘Mediterranean-like’ dietary pattern standing in opposition against CVDs. Figure S42 visualizes the
association of men’s raised blood pressure with animal products in the category of health expenditure
of 500–2000 USD per capita. However, it also shows that men’s raised blood pressure is found
among sunflower oil, potatoes and alcoholic beverages, which our study repeatedly identifies as being
foodstuffs associated with CVD risk. Interestingly, women’s raised blood pressure and CVD mortality
lie midway between sunflower oil and carbohydrate sources. Figure S43 displays a factor analysis of
 Nutrients 2018, 10, 411
31 of 39
115 countries, after the inclusion of smoking, and clearly shows the close connection between men’s
smoking and men’s CVD mortality.
Figure 11. Projection of 158 countries on the factor plane of Figure 10.
An alternative factor analysis that only works with 116 non-European countries (Figure S44)
identifies a group of variables associated with low rates of raised blood glucose and high rates of
undernutrition in the Southeastern section (rice, maize, legumes, starchy roots, freshwater fish, etc.).
The same variables also emerged in Table 8. Figure S45 includes only 51 non-European countries with
health expenditure above 500 USD per capita and displays a similar pattern, except for raised blood
glucose which moves to the Northeastern section, close to CVD mortality and raised blood pressure.
Apparently, this is due to the exclusion of impoverished countries in which low blood glucose is
determined by undernutrition.
In both these non-European comparisons, CVD indicators stand in stronger opposition to animal
products and not to the ‘Mediterranean-like’ pattern. The most likely explanation is that some
components of the ‘Mediterranean diet’ (especially dairy products) are not consumed very frequently
outside Europe. However, a thing that both these nutritional styles have in common is the low
proportion of carbohydrates.
3.5. Penalized Regression Analyses
Three penalized regression models (ridge, LASSO, elastic net) were computed in the case of
women’s raised blood pressure, CVD mortality and raised blood glucose. They included 64 variables
 Nutrients 2018, 10, 411
32 of 39
(60 food items, mean BMI, obesity, raised cholesterol, health expenditure), and their frequency in these
regression models (among the top 10 variables with the highest absolute beta coefficients) is displayed
in Table 10. Variables that appeared in these models at least twice are further divided according
to the sign of their beta coefficients (positive/negative), which usually agrees with their r-values in
Pearson correlations.

Because these models select common denominators out of a large number of mutually correlated
variables, they can identify proxies for certain dietary patterns which may not necessarily have
causal relationships to CVD risk. Indeed, the causal roles of some items (alcohol, pork, pelagic
marine fish) are again unlikely, but the results generally do not differ from those based on other
statistical methods in this study, with various carbohydrate sources (mainly cereals) being the variables
most consistently associated with CVD risk. Penalized regression analyses performed with 92 countries
(health expenditure above 500 USD per capita) produce somewhat different results than the whole
sample analyses, but there are several variables emerging in both analyses, in all six regression models:
fish and seafood, and oranges and mandarins in the case of raised blood pressure; sunflower oil in the
case of CVD mortality; and mean BMI in the case of raised blood glucose.
3.6. Temporal Changes of Correlation Coefficients
The examination of long-term correlations between CVD indicators and food supply is the most
meaningful in the category of health expenditure of 500–2000 USD per capita that includes 61 countries
(18 countries from Europe). It is here where variables with small consumption rates (distilled beverages
 Nutrients 2018, 10, 411
33 of 39
and sunflower oil) are the most prominent, and hence, their possible spurious association with CVDs
can best be observed. In this country sample, we also observe eccentric positive correlations of animal
products (especially dairy) with CVD risk which also emerge in partial correlations (Table 6) and
strikingly differ from those found in women.
Figure 12A,B display the relationship between the incidence of raised blood pressure (2010) and
10 food items from the period 1993–2010. At first glance, this comparison shows that dairy products
in this sample are associated with potatoes. Provided that the level of significance in the regression
slope test is set at p > 0.05, the trend lines of potatoes and dairy do not reach particularly high p-values
(p = 0.001 in men, p = 0.045 in women), but these two food items are quite strongly correlated even at the
level of mean consumption (r = 0.65, p < 0.001), and cluster together in factor analyses (see especially
Figure S42). Because potatoes serve as a substrate for the production of distilled beverages, and,
according to our experience, they often emerge in the context of alcohol in ecological comparisons, it is
very likely that they reflect the consumption of homemade distilled alcohol in the former USSR. In fact,
countries consuming large amounts of alcohol are largely identical with those consuming the most
dairy and potatoes in this sample (compare Figures S46–S49). Furthermore, potatoes are also sources
of high-glycaemic starch, and hence, their position as a CVD risk factor would be potentiated.
Figure 12. (A) Temporal changes in correlation coefficients (r-values) between men’s raised blood
pressure (2010) and 10 food items. Countries with health expenditure of 500–2000 USD per capita

pressure (2010) and 10 food items. Countries with health expenditure of 500–2000 USD per capita

The much stronger association of alcoholic beverages and potatoes with men’s raised blood
pressure would definitely make good sense because men are more frequent alcohol drinkers than
women. At the same time, the potentially protective nature of dairy products is not mutually exclusive
with their positive, spurious correlation with alcohol-related men’s CVD prevalence because heavy
 Nutrients 2018, 10, 411
34 of 39
alcohol drinkers are unlikely to consume large amounts of milk or even other dairy. The higher role
of alcohol in men would also explain, why other potential CVD triggers (carbohydrates) recede to
the background. In contrast, women’s raised blood pressure correlates most strongly with cereals
and sunflower oil. Because their trend lines are completely different (p < 0.001), and both these items
are unrelated, even at the level of mean consumption (r = 0.19, p = 0.14), this picture supports the
causal role of sunflower oil. Nevertheless, if more accurate data on men’s CVD prevalence from
non-European countries were available, the significance of carbohydrate sources would probably be
much stronger even in men.
Another mutual link can be observed between animal protein, sunflower oil, and alcoholic
beverages, but only the slopes of the former two in men, and the latter two in women reach the level
of significance (p > 0.05).
Also noteworthy is the fact that the trend lines of sunflower oil and alcohol are cumulative and
peak several years before the collection of raised blood pressure statistics. This indicates an acute effect
which would certainly not be surprising in the case of alcohol binge drinking which is a serious social
problem in the former USSR. In contrast, the trend lines of carbohydrates (especially cereals) tend to
increase with increasing time which points to a chronic effect.
An additional analysis with 91 countries (health expenditure above 500 USD per capita) shows
virtually the same inter–item relationships and trends (Figures S50 and S51). Although, even here,
the long-term connection between dairy and potatoes in men is less persuasive when expressed
statistically (p < 0.001), it is almost perfectly linear in women (p = 0.93).
4. Discussion
To our knowledge, the present study is the first that has compared the complete global statistics
of CVD prevalence with the nutrition statistics from the FAOSTAT database. The results show that
the contemporary CVD statistics have certain limitations that must be taken into account during the
interpretation of the results. In particular, men’s statistics of CVD mortality seem to be very unreliable.
In addition, there are some specific confounding factors, especially the religious ban on alcohol and
pork in Muslim countries, which simultaneously consume the highest amount of cereals and wheat
in the world, and suffer from very high obesity rates. Besides this, the analysis of potential CVD
risk factors is not complete, due to the lack of data on smoking prevalence (which was limited to
115 countries). Salt (sodium) consumption could be another important risk factor, but these statistics
were analyzed elsewhere [28] and are based only on urinary excretion or estimated dietary intake from
66 countries. Therefore, our study should be taken mainly as a sort of pioneering one in this regard,
and due to its ecological (country-level) methodology, it should primarily be viewed as descriptive.
Still, after an exhaustive analysis, we can say that in all the statistical comparisons that have
been made, the indicators of CVDs always show the most consistent association with high carbohydrate
consumption, especially in the form of high-glycaemic cereals, in particular wheat. Other suspect
variables are alcohol (mainly in its distilled form) and sunflower oil, but their roles are limited to
Europe where their consumption rates are sufficiently high.
Although the ecological design cannot prove causality at the level of individuals, the results
can be very beneficial when combined with findings based on different methodologies because
they overcome their own specific drawbacks (the accuracy of input data in observational studies,
the short-term character of controlled interventional studies). It is true that the connection between
CVDs and carbohydrates has not been universally accepted yet, but both epidemiological and
mechanistic evidence is growing, and this fundamental problem has attracted wide public attention.
Actually, our results—including the link between raised cholesterol and lower CVD risk—have been
almost perfectly replicated by the recent global PURE (Prospective Urban and Rural Epidemiological)
study [32,33], the most shared scientific work in the world in 2017 [34]. Excessive alcohol drinking is
also recognized as an important factor of CVD risk [35] and can explain the recent epidemic of CVDs
in men from the former USSR republics [20].

The role of sunflower oil is less clear. Even its leading position in the penalized regression models
is not a guarantee of a true causal relationship because these models may sometimes select a mere
proxy (common denominator) for certain dietary patterns. In fact, sunflower oil is consumed mainly
in Eastern European countries, where both carbohydrate consumption and alcohol drinking reach
the highest rates in Europe. Still, a meaningful rationale of this finding does exist and may lie in the
high content of linoleic acid in sunflower oil and its proatherogenic properties [36]. This problem is a
subject of ongoing debate [37].
The list of negative correlates is less consistent in details because it may differ according to
regional dietary habits. It is quite understandable that some foodstuffs which have a strong role
in Europe (dairy products, but also tree nuts) do not reach such a status elsewhere because their
consumption rates are relatively negligible. However, the factor analyses repeatedly display a very
similar picture, with CVD indicators standing in opposition against high fat/protein consumption and
animal products. The most frequently highlighted foodstuffs (fruits, oranges and mandarins, fish and
seafood) also emerged in the sample of 42 European countries [14]. Because the spectrum of foods
used in this study was practically exhaustive, these relationships cannot be explained by any hidden
dietary confounder. Provided that the ‘saturated fat hypothesis’ is correct, we would have to assume
that in every part of the world, some other exogenous factor (most likely healthcare) is always able
to completely reverse the relationship between nutrition and CVD. While this might apply to CVD
mortality, where the effect of healthcare is the most direct, it cannot relate to the statistics of raised
blood glucose that include the use of medications. The fact that we confirmed the well-established
connection between raised blood glucose and obesity/high-glycaemic foods demonstrates that the
ecological methodology produces biologically valid and meaningful results, provided that good quality
data are available.
The statistics of raised blood pressure also reflect CVD prevalence, but they do not include the
use of blood pressure-lowering drugs. This may skew the true prevalence rates of this fundamental
CVD indicator. Nevertheless, our data from Europe show that when the use of medications is taken
into account, the observed trends are even stronger, particularly in men. Furthermore, the most precise
statistics (that are available from a limited number of countries) show that the prevalence of raised
blood pressure is higher (and increasing) in low-income countries [38]. Therefore, we expect that when
more objective data on raised blood pressure or CVD events are available, the geographical pattern of
CVD prevalence will be confirmed.
Another noteworthy finding is the disproportionately lower prevalence of (women’s) raised
blood pressure in Asian countries consuming rice as the main cereal in their diet. Interestingly,
this finding was supported by adjusted partial correlations (Table 6), and manifests even in factor
analyses (Figure S41). It is therefore tempting to speculate that rice offers some health advantage,
when compared with wheat and other cereals. In the available literature, there is some limited evidence
that the beneficial effects of rice—at least in comparison with wheat—could be real [39–41] and this
problem merits further research. On the other hand, the seemingly protective role of refined sugar
in some analyses has a more prosaic explanation. Although its glycaemic index (65) is lower than
in white wheat bread (75) or boiled potatoes (77) [42], even more important is the fact that its mean
consumption (9.6% of total energy) lags far behind high glycaemic plant starches (% CC energy & %
SRC energy) (42.6%), and these two variables have a strongly negative relationship (r = −0.76, p <
0.001).
5. Conclusions
In summary, our study shows that the divergent association of basic nutritional components
with CVD indicators, which we found in our previous study [14], holds true both for Europe and
regions outside Europe. More convincing results will be possible when more precise data on CVD
prevalence are available. Because self-reported dietary questionnaires from observational studies are
increasingly perceived as the dead end of nutritional science [43], such high-quality data are urgently

needed. Results of detailed ecological analyses such as the present one can subsequently constitute a
very useful contribution to the recent debate regarding the changing paradigm in cardiology.
