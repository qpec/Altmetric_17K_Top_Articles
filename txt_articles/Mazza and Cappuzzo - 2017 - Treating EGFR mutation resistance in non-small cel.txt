Abstract: The discovery of mutations in EGFR significantly changed the treatment paradigm 
of patients with EGFR-mutant non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC), a particular group of 
patients with different clinical characteristics and outcome to EGFR-wild-type patients. In these 
patients, the treatment of choice as first-line therapy is first- or second-generation EGFR-tyrosine 
kinase inhibitors (EGFR-TKIs), such as gefitinib, erlotinib, or afatinib. Inevitably, after the ini-
tial response, all patients become refractory to these drugs. The most common mechanism of 
acquired resistance to EGFR-TKIs is the development of a second mutation in exon 20 of EGFR 
(T790M). Osimertinib is a third-generation EGFR-TKI designed for overcoming T790M-mediated 
resistance. Based on the results of efficacy and tolerability of Phase II and Phase III studies, 
osimertinib has been approved for treatment of advanced EGFRT790M+ mutation NSCLC following 
progression on a prior EGFR-TKI. Occurrence of acquired resistance to osimertinib represents 
an urgent need for additional strategies including combination with other agents, such as other 
targeted therapies or checkpoint inhibitors, or development of new and more potent compounds.

Introduction
Lung cancer is the second most commonly diagnosed cancer and the main cause of 
cancer-related mortality in both men and women. Non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) 
represents ~85% of lung cancer cases and it presents as metastatic disease in over half 
of all cases. In the last few years, treatment of NSCLC has radically changed after the 
discovery that inhibition by target agents of molecular drivers, such as EGFR, could 
be effective in reducing tumor burden. The prevalence of EGFR mutations in adeno-
carcinoma is 10% of Western and up to 50% of Asian patients. It is well known that 
EGFR mutations are more frequently observed in Asiatic than in Caucasian patients, 
in female, in never smokers, and mainly in adenocarcinomas, with deletion in exon 
19 or point mutation in exon 21 (L858R) as the most common (>90%) types. Nine 
randomized Phase III clinical trials (OPTIMAL, First Signal, IPASS, WJTOG 3405, 
NEJSG 002, EURTAC, ENSURE, LUX-3, LUX-6) demonstrated that, in patients 
harboring classical EGFR mutations, EGFR-tyrosine kinase inhibitors (EGFR-TKIs) 
such as erlotinib, gefitinib, or afatinib are superior to the standard platinum-based che-
motherapy in terms of response rate, progression-free survival (PFS), toxicity profile, 
and quality of life (Table 1). In up to 60%–80% of patients treated with an EGFR-TKI, 
there is a meaningful tumor regression, but inevitably, after a median time of 9–12

months, all patients develop acquired resistance and become 
refractory.1–5 Among the different mechanisms of acquired 
resistance, a secondary mutation, T790M, in the exon 20 
of the EGFR gene is the most frequent event, occurring in 
~50%–60% of cases. At the present time, only one agent has 
been US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) approved for 
treatment of EGFRT790M+ patients. Phase II studies and more 
recently a large Phase III trial demonstrated that osimertinib 
(Tagrisso, AstraZeneca, London, UK) is active in EGFR-TKI-
pretreated, EGFRT790M+ patients, representing today the best 
option in the acquired resistance setting.5–8
Resistance to EGFR-TKIs
According to Jackman’s criteria, resistant patients should 
have the following features:
1. Previously received treatment with a single-agent 
EGFR-TKI; 
2. Either or both the following elements: a tumor harboring 
an EGFR mutation known to be associated with drug sen-
sitivity (ie, G719X, exon 19 deletion, L858R, L861Q) or 
objective clinical benefit from treatment with an EGFR-
TKI (documented partial or complete response [CR] 
according to RECIST or WHO criteria) or significant 
and durable (≥6 months) clinical benefits (stable disease 
[SD] as defined by RECIST or WHO) after initiation of 
an EGFR-TKI.
The following criteria are additional: systemic progression 
while on continuous treatment with an EGFR-TKI within the 
last 30 days and no intervening systemic therapy between ces-
sation of EGFR-TKIs and new therapy.9 Acquired resistance 
to EGFR-TKIs can be target dependent, if it is characterized 
by the development of a second mutation in EGFR sequence, 
or target independent, if it is a consequence of the activation 
of alternative pathways.4 The most frequent mechanism of 
acquired resistance (up to 60% of cases) is target dependent 
and consists of the emergence of the T790M mutation, a 
characteristic point mutation in exon 20 of the EGFR gene. 
Target-independent mechanisms include MET amplification 
(4%), human EGFR type 2 (HER2) amplification (8%–13%), 
PIK3CA mutation (2%), BRAF mutation (1%), histological 
transformation from NSCLC to SCLC (6%), or epithelial–
mesenchymal transition (1%-2%).2,4 In 18% of the cases, the 
mechanism of acquired resistance is unknown (Figure 1). 
Histological and biological review of tissue samples, taken 
after the development of acquired resistance, demonstrated 
that, in some cases, these mechanisms overlap and are not 
mutually exclusive.10 
The complexity of resistance mechanisms highlights the 
importance of repeating a tumor biopsy at the time of disease 
progression. Moreover, availability of new agents specifi-
cally effective only in the presence of EGFRT790M mutation 
explains why tumor re-biopsy is now entering into clinical 
practice. Unfortunately, in lung cancer patients, repeating 
tumor biopsy is not feasible in the majority of cases mainly 
because of the risk related to a new biopsy in a difficult-to-
access disease or patient refusal. Therefore, during the last 
few years, much interest is growing around the possibility 
to assess the mutational status on circulating tumor DNA 
(ctDNA). The so-called “liquid biopsy,” which involves iso-
lating ctDNA in plasma or other biologic fluids, including 
urine, presents several advantages including the fact that it is

Treating EGFR mutation resistance
easy to perform, rapid, and repeatable, overcoming the prob-
lem of tumor heterogeneity.11,12 The only relevant limitation 
is represented by the relatively low sensitivity (60%–80%). 
Sensitivity is also influenced by the type of mutation and 
tumor burden, with patients with low tumor burden at a high 
risk of a false-negative result. Therefore, in clinical practice, 
liquid biopsy is now recommended as the first test to offer 
to the patient, with tumor biopsy recommended only in the 
case of a negative result (Figure 2).13
Pharmacodynamic
The T790M mutation consists of the substitution of threonine 
at the “gatekeeper” amino acid 790 by methionine. This 
mutation makes the receptor refractory to the inhibition by 
reversible EGFR-TKIs through both steric hindrance and 
increased ATP affinity (its natural substrate). Osimertinib is 
an oral, irreversible, third-generation TKI targeting T790M 
and EGFR-TKI-sensitizing mutation sparing the activity of 
wild-type EGFR. First-generation reversible TKIs (erlotinib 
and gefitinib) are ineffective at targeting T790M, while they 
strongly inhibit wild-type EGFR cell lines with similar 
potency to sensitizing mutant EGFR. Second-generation irre-
versible TKIs (afatinib and dacomitinib) show activity against 
T790M in vitro, but concentrations required to overcome 
T790M activity preclinically are not achievable in humans 
due to non-selective inhibition of wild-type EGFR which is 
associated with significant toxicity.14 The good safety profile 
and the tolerability of osimertinib are related to the selec-
tive inhibition of T790M and EGFR-sensitizing mutation. 
1) Osimertinib is less potent at inhibiting phosphorylation 
of EGFR in wild-type cell lines. It is associated with lower 
skin and gastrointestinal toxicity.
Clinical trials
AURA5 was a Phase 1 study assessing the safety, toler-
ability, and efficacy of osimertinib. Eligible patients had 
a locally advanced or metastatic NSCLC, had a known 
EGFR-TKI-sensitizing mutation or a prior clinical benefit 
from treatment with EGFR-TKI, and had a radiologically 
documented disease progression while receiving such 
treatment. This study included dose-escalation and dose-
expansion cohorts. In the dose-escalation cohorts, patients 
received a single dose of osimertinib. The first dose tested 
was 20 mg daily. Each subsequent dose represented a 100% 
increase from the previous dose, with the exception of the 
final dose escalation, which was from 160 mg once daily 
to 240 mg once daily. In the dose-escalation cohorts, pre-
treatment EGFRT790M testing was optional, while in the 
dose-expansion cohorts, a new tumor biopsy was required 
after disease progression on the most recent regimen. Testing 
for EGFR T790M was performed in a central laboratory or 
in a local laboratory followed by confirmation in a central 
laboratory. The objective response rate (ORR) for the entire 
population was 51% and the disease control rate (DCR) (CR 
plus partial response  plus SD) was 84%. In patients harboring 
the T790M mutation, the ORR was 61% and the DCR was 
95%. There was activity in the T790M-negative patients with 
an ORR of 21% and DCR of 61%. In EGFRT790M+ patients, 
the median PFS was 9.6 months and in EGFRT790M– patients, 
it was 2.8 months. The most common adverse events (AEs) 
were diarrhea (47%), rash (40%), nausea (22%), and anorexia 
(21%). Grade 3 or higher AEs were observed in 32% of 
patients, with AEs leading to dose reduction in 7% of patients 
and AEs leading to drug discontinuation in 6% of patients.5,15 
The optimal dose to obtain the best efficacy with the lower 
risk of toxicity is 80 mg once daily.
AURA ex,6 a Phase II extension cohort of the Phase I trial, 
evaluated the efficacy, tolerability, and safety of osimertinib 
at a dose of 80 mg once daily in the EGFRT790M+patients 
progressing after EGFR-TKI treatment. Similar to the results 
from the Phase I trial, the ORR was 61% with a DCR of 91%. 
Osimertinib was well tolerated with drug-related grade ≥3 
AEs reported in 12% of the patients and a discontinuation rate 
of 4%. These promising results were confirmed also in AURA

2 study,7 a Phase II, single-arm trial conducted in EGFRT790M+, 
which showed an ORR of 71%, with a DCR of 92% and a 
median PFS of 6.8 months.6,7 In a combined analysis of 411 
patients in both Phase II trials (AURA ex and AURA 2), 
the most commonly reported all-grade AEs were diarrhea 
(42%), rash (41%), dry skin (31%), nail toxicity (25%), eye 
disorders (18%), nausea (17%), decreased appetite (16%), 
and constipation (15%). These events were primary grade 1/2, 
with a low rate of grade ≥3 AEs. The most common grade 
≥3 AEs were pneumonia (2%) and pulmonary embolism 
(2%). Across both studies, dose reductions as a result of 
AEs were needed for 4.4% of patients. The most frequently 
reported AEs that led to a dose reduction or interruption 
were QTc prolongation (2%) and neutropenia (2%). Other 
AEs resulting in treatment discontinuation were interstitial 
lung disease (ILD) or pneumonitis (2%) and cerebrovascular 
accident (1%). Fatal AEs occurred in 3.2% of patients and 
consisted of four cases of pneumonitis, which were attributed 
to osimertinib.6,7 Since in AURA and AURA 2 trials brain 
metastases were assessed as non-target lesions, there were no 
measurements of metastatic brain lesion diameter. Therefore, 
it was not possible to calculate an ORR or DCR for central 
nervous system (CNS) disease. In these studies, the propor-
tion of patients with the CNS as the first site of progression 
was 12%.16 Omuro et al reported that the incidence of the 
CNS as an initial failure site reached 33% in EGFR-TKI 
responders with advanced NSCLC.17 Approximately half of 
patients with EGFR-positive metastatic NSCLC treated with 
first-line chemotherapy develop CNS disease relapse, and 
the low rate of primary CNS relapse in AURA and AURA 2 
trials may suggest a CNS antitumor activity16 of osimertinib. 
The mechanism underlying the relationship between clinical 
benefit from EGFR-TKIs and CNS metastasis may involve 
several causal factors. Prolonged survival through the use of 
EGFR-TKIs may coincide with a substantial risk of develop-
ing CNS metastasis, as the cranial event occurs in a relatively 
late phase of the disease. The high frequency of EGFR muta-
tions in brain metastases of lung adenocarcinoma suggests 
an intrinsic brain tropism of these tumors. Incomplete drug 
penetration of the brain–blood barrier may account for the 
increased incidence of CNS metastasis. Metastatic CNS 
clones may possess an inherited resistance to EGFR-TKIs, or 
they may acquire earlier drug resistance during EGFR-TKI 
therapy.17,47 Noteworthy, first-generation EGFR-TKIs hardly 
penetrate across the blood–brain barrier at the recommended 
doses.18 Based on the data from Phase II studies (AURA 
extension6 and AURA 27), osimertinib was approved by FDA, 
in November 2015, and by  European Medicines Agency, in 
April 2016, for patients with advanced EGFRT790M+ NSCLC 
following progression on a prior EGFR-TKI.
AURA 3,8 published on December 2016, is a Phase III trial 
comparing osimertinib with platinum-based doublet chemo-
therapy in patients with EGFRT790M+ advanced NSCLC after 
first-line EGFR-TKI therapy. Patients were randomly assigned 
to received oral osimertinib (80 mg once daily) or intravenous 
pemetrexed (500 mg/m2) plus either carboplatin area under 
the curve (AUC) 5 or cisplatin (75 mg/m2). The median PFS 
was significantly longer with osimertinib than with platinum-
based chemotherapy (10.1 months vs 4.4 months). This 
benefit was observed across all predefined subgroups also 
among patients with stable, asymptomatic CNS metastases 
(8.5 months vs 4.2 months), supporting preclinical and clinical 
data suggesting that osimertinib may be an EGFR-TKI with 
improved brain exposure.19 The ORR was significantly bet-
ter with osimertinib than with platinum-based chemotherapy 
(71% vs 31%). The good clinical profile of osimertinib was 
confirmed also in AURA 3 trial: the proportion of patients 
with grade 3 AEs was 23% in the osimertinib group and 47% 
in the chemotherapy group. Osimertinib was associated with 
a lower rate of AEs leading to permanent discontinuation.8
Leptomeningeal metastasis is another detrimental com-
plication of advanced EGFR mutation-positive NSCLC. 
A Phase I study (BLOOM study NCT02228369) is ongoing 
to test osimertinib monotherapy at 160 mg once daily against 
brain and leptomeningeal metastasis. Preliminary data dem-
onstrated encouraging results in terms of safety and efficacy.20
According to the clinical activity and tolerability, osimer-
tinib is being tested in other Phase III studies. In FLAURA 
Phase III trial (NCT02296125), treatment-naïve patients with 
locally advanced or metastatic EGFR mutant NSCLC were 
randomly assigned to receive osimertinib (80 mg qd, orally) 
or standard of care EGFR-TKI (gefitinib 250 mg qd, orally, 
or erlotinib 150 mg qd, orally).21 
Combination treatment is another strategy to improve the 
efficacy and antitumor activity. TATTON trial (NCT02143466) 
is a multi-arm, Phase Ib trial investigating osimertinib 80 mg 
once daily in combination with durvalumab (anti-PD-L1 
monoclonal antibody) or with savolitinib (MET inhibitor) 
or with selumetinib (MEK 1/2 inhibitor) in patients with 
advanced EGFR-mutant lung cancer. Primary objectives were 
safety and tolerability and the secondary objective was clini-
cal activity of the combinations. An increase in ILD events 
was observed with the combination of osimertinib plus dur-
valumab. Therefore, enrollment in the osimertinib plus dur-
valumab combination arm has been suspended.22 Other trials 
assessing the combination treatment are ongoing: osimertinib

Treating EGFR mutation resistance
plus necitumumab (NCT02496663), plus ramucirumab 
(NCT02789345), or plus bevacizumab (NCT02803203). In 
addition to metastatic disease, osimertinib is being tested 
in the adjuvant setting (ADAURA study, NCT02511106).23
Currently, osimertinib is the only EGFR-TKI approved 
for patients with metastatic EGFRT790M+ NSCLC. Rociletinib 
(Clovis) is another third-generation EGFR-TKI designed to 
inhibit both T790M and EGFR-activating mutations while 
sparing wild-type EGFR. Rociletinib has been investigated 
in EGFR-mutant patients who progressed after at least one 
line of EGFR-TKI treatment (TIGER X Phase I/II trial), in 
first-line setting versus erlotinib in EGFR-mutated patients 
(TIGER 1 Phase II/III trial), and in second-line post-standard 
EGFR-TKI treatment (TIGER 2 Phase II trial) versus che-
motherapy in patients who have progressed after standard 
EGFR-TKI and after platinum-based doublet chemotherapy.2 
Despite initial promising results, Clovis has stopped the clini-
cal development of rociletinib because of updated data reveal-
ing lower response rates than initially reported, a negative 
vote from the FDA’s Oncologic Drugs Advisory Committee 
(ODAC), and FDA approval of osimertinib, rociletinib’s main 
competitor in the setting.24,25 Further third-generation EGFR-
TKIs in clinical development are HM61713, ASP8273, 
EGF816, and PF-06747775.26
Immune checkpoint inhibitors and 
EGFR-TKIs
Recent data showed that nivolumab (Checkmate 05727 
and Checkmate 01728), pembrolizumab (Keyote 01029), 
and atezolizumab (POPLAR30 and recently OAK31 study) 
are superior to docetaxel in second-line setting and pem-
brolizumab (Keynote-02432) also improve survival versus 
platinum-based chemotherapy in PD-L1-positive untreated 
NSCLC. As shown in these studies, among EGFR-mutant 
patients, the efficacy of checkpoint inhibitors was lower 
than that in wild-type population probably because of the 
low level of mutational load in EGFR-mutant tumors. 
EGFR-mutant NSCLC expresses higher PD-L1 levels than 
wild-type, while gefitinib can reduce the PD-L1 expression, 
suggesting that combined strategies of EGFR-TKI and 
immunotherapy may be an interesting approach.33 While 
promising results come from a combination of nivolumab 
plus erlotinib in EGFR-mutant advanced NSCLC with 
acquired resistance to EGFR-TKI34 and from pembroli-
zumab plus gefitinib in heavily pretreated (up to four prior 
therapies) EGFR-mutant NSCLC,35 association treatment 
with osimertinib showed significant toxicity. In the Phase I 
TATTON trial (NCT02143466) and in Phase III CAURAL 
trial (NCT02143466), the combination of osimertinib and 
durvalumab (anti-PD-L1 monoclonal antibody) in patients 
with EGFR-mutant NSCLC with acquired resistance to 
EGFR-TKI and T790M positivity showed a high incidence 
of ILD.22,23 However further Phase I/II combination trials of 
checkpoint inhibitors are ongoing in EGFR-TKI-naïve and 
pretreated patients (NCT02013219: erlotinib plus atezoli-
zumab, NCT02364609: afatinib plus pembrolizumab).36 
Several clinical studies are underway to assess new immuno-
therapy strategies in different settings.37 A combination of ipi-
limumab and nivolumb has been tested as first-line treatment 
in advanced NSCLC with interesting ORR.48 Durvalumab 
(anti-PD-L1) and tremelimumab (anti-CTLA4) showed clini-
cal activity in relapsed NSCLC.49 Many studies are ongoing 
to test new targets for immunotherapy such as inhibitory 
molecules (indoleamine-dioxygenase, adenosine, TIM-3, 
LAG-3) or stimulatory molecules (OX40, CD40, CD27), 
new peptide vaccines targeting novel antitumor antigens, 
alternative checkpoint inhibitors, chimeric antigen receptor 
T cells (CAR-T), histone deacetylase (HDAC) inhibitors, and 
DNA hypomethylating agents target epigenetics for tumor 
growth suppression.50 Immune checkpoint inhibitors have 
been approved for therapy of a variety of advanced cancers, 
and they also can be considered for combination therapy to 
overcome the acquired resistance to EGFR-TKIs.37
Clinical strategies beyond 
EGFR-TKI progression
The standard of care for patients with acquired resistance 
to EGFR-TKIs is rapidly changing after the development 
of third-generation EGFR-TKIs targeting both T790M and 
EGFR-TKI-sensitizing mutation. Osimertinib is the new 
standard of care in patients with metastatic EGFRT790M+ 
NSCLC after progression on erlotininb, gefitinib, or afatinib. 
A second-line platinum-based doublet chemotherapy remains 
the standard of care in patients without T790M mutation or 
other targetable resistance mechanism especially in the case 
of dramatic progression.3,36 EGFR-TKIs should be interrupted 
during chemotherapy, although some clones of EGFR-mutant 
NSCLC maintain dependence on EGFR signaling after the 
development of acquired resistance. IMPRESS study is a 
randomized Phase III trial comparing maintenance gefitinib 
combined with pemetrexed and cisplatin versus chemo-
therapy alone in patients with acquired resistance to gefitinib. 
No difference in PFS was reported in both the arms (median 
PFS 5.4 months in both the groups). Combination treatment 
showed a detrimental effect on the overall survival compared 
with chemotherapy alone. Patients without T790M mutation

had a non-significant benefit with combination treatment 
(PFS 6.7 vs 5.4 months).38 For patients with oligometastatic 
progression, local therapies such as radiotherapy, surgery, 
and stereotactic ablative radiotherapy in conjunction with 
continued EGFR-TKI can extend disease control by over 
6 months.39 Finally, patients with indolent, asymptomatic 
progression, and good performance status may continue to 
be treated with EGFR-TKI beyond RECIST progression if 
there is no evidence of deterioration or intolerable toxicity 
(Figure 3). These strategies are supported by the risk of dis-
ease flare after EGFR-TKI cessation, considering that some 
clones remain sensitive to EGFR inhibition after the acquired 
resistance.3,36 Second-generation irreversible TKIs failed to 
overcome T790M-mediated resistance because concentra-
tions at which they overcome T790M activity preclinically are 
not achievable in humans due to dose-limiting toxicity related 
to non-selective inhibition of wild-type EGFR.40 Vertical 
inhibition, the simultaneous inhibition of both extracellular 
and intracellular receptor domains with the combination of 
cetuximab and Afatinib, in a Phase Ib clinical trial demon-
strated promising results, but the high rate of toxicity limited 
its use in clinical practice.41
Acquired resistance to a 
T790M‑specific EGFR inhibitor 
The main mechanism of resistance to osimertinib and to 
all third-generation irreversible EGFR inhibitors42 is the 
acquisition of missense mutation EGFR C797S in exon 20 
which consist of the substitution of cysteine with serine at 
the amino acid position 797 within the kinase-binding site. 
Osimertinib loses the ability to form covalent bond with 
EGFR at the position of cysteine residue.12 EGFR C797S 
arise in approximately one-third of patients treated with 
osimertinib11 over a period of 9–13 months.42 In preclinical 
models, the configuration of T790M and C797S mutation 
affects how cells respond to therapy. If the two mutations are 
in trans (on different alleles), cells are resistant to third-gen-
eration EGFR-TKIs, but a combination of first-generation 
TKIs can restore EGFR inhibition. If the two mutations are 
in cis (on the same allele), cells are refractory to any EGFR-
TKIs.12,23 In a case report of a patient with an EGFR-mutant 
lung cancer, next-generation sequencing (NGS) techniques 
were performed on three biopsy specimens obtained 
before treatment with erlotinib, after acquired resistance to 
erlotinib, and after acquired resistance to AZD9291. The 
original sensitizing EGFR mutation was present in all tumor 
samples. Under the selective pressure of EGFR-TKIs, the 
tumor developed secondary (T790M) and tertiary (C797S) 
mutations to maintain EGFR signaling.43 A subsequent study 
collected plasma samples from 15 patients who received 
osimertinib therapy and had preexisting plasma EGFRT790M. 
A total of 40% of patients had EGFRdel19/T790M/C797S, 33% of 
patients had EGFRT790M alone, and EGFR T790M was no lon-
ger detectable in 27% of patients.44 Interestingly, in patients 
with chronic lymphocytic leukemia treated with ibrutinib, 
(Bruton tyrosine kinase [BTK] inhibitor), mutations have 
been detected in C481 (C481S), the analogous cysteine 
residue to C797 in EGFR, suggesting that mutations in this 
conserved residue may be a common mechanism of acquired 
resistance to covalent kinase inhibitors.45 Additional mecha-
nisms of resistance to osimertinib in patients negative for 
C797S include HER-2 or MET amplification, loss of T790M 
mutation,46 EGFR L718Q, EGFR L798I, KRAS G12S.42 In 
addition to acquired mutations and gene amplifications, 
phenotype transformation represents a distinct mechanism 
of resistance. Adenocarcinoma turns into small cell lung 
cancer with RB1 inactivation as the defining features.42 The 
genomic heterogeneity associated with resistance to EGFR-
TKIs in NSCLC requires the development of target therapy 
to overcome C797S resistance and combination therapies

Treating EGFR mutation resistance
that can inhibit the emergence of multiple resistance mecha-
nisms.44 EAI045 is the first allosteric TKI purposefully 
designed to overcome T790M and EGFR C797S mutations. 
In a genetically engineered mouse model of L858R/T790M 
mutant-driven lung cancer, EAI045 was tested alone and in 
combination with cetuximab. While the allosteric inhibi-
tor was ineffective alone due to receptor dimerization, the 
combination of EAI045 and cetuximab showed significant 
tumor regression. Clinical trials are required to assess these 
results in patients with advanced NSCLC.42
Conclusion
Acquired resistance is one of the most significant limitations 
in lung cancer treatment. Despite an initial benefit to target 
therapies, all patients become refractory. Identification of 
mechanisms involved in drug resistance is essential to tailor 
the best treatment strategy for each patient. This is the reason 
why identification of biomarkers should be encouraged and 
appropriate tissue sample or plasma assay is essential for 
biological characterization. Failure of currently available 
targeted therapies suggests that a single agent may be not suf-
ficient to overcome drug resistance. New strategies, including 
combination treatment, are currently under investigation to 
identify new opportunities of treatment.
