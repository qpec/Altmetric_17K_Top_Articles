ABSTRACT
Background Acute respiratory distress syndrome
(ARDS) is an often fatal neutrophil-dominant lung
disease. Although influenced by multiple
proinflammatory mediators, identification of suitable
therapeutic candidates remains elusive. We aimed to
delineate the presence of mitochondrial formylated
peptides in ARDS and characterise the functional
importance of formyl peptide receptor 1 (FPR1)
signalling in sterile lung inflammation.
Methods Mitochondrial formylated peptides were
identified in bronchoalveolar lavage fluid (BALF) and
serum of patients with ARDS by liquid chromatography–
tandem mass spectrometry. In vitro, human neutrophils
were stimulated with mitochondrial formylated peptides
and their effects assessed by flow cytometry and
chemotaxis assay. Mouse lung injury was induced by
mitochondrial formylated peptides or hydrochloric acid.
Bone marrow chimeras determined the contribution of
myeloid and parenchymal FPR1 to sterile lung
inflammation.
Results Mitochondrial formylated peptides were
elevated in BALF and serum from patients with ARDS.
These peptides drove neutrophil activation and
chemotaxis through FPR1-dependent mechanisms in
vitro and in vivo. In mouse lung injury, inflammation was
attenuated in Fpr1−/− mice, effects recapitulated by a
pharmacological FPR1 antagonist even when
administered after the onset of injury. FPR1 expression
was present in alveolar epithelium and chimeric mice
demonstrated that both myeloid and parenchymal FPR1
contributed to lung inflammation.
Conclusions We provide the first definitive evidence of
mitochondrial formylated peptides in human disease and
demonstrate them to be elevated in ARDS and important
in a mouse model of lung injury. This work reveals
mitochondrial formylated peptide FPR1 signalling as a
key driver of sterile acute lung injury and a potential
therapeutic target in ARDS.
INTRODUCTION
Acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) is the
often fatal common pathway of a broad range of
sterile
and
infective
aetiologies.
These
include
direct insults to the lung parenchyma such as bac-
terial or viral pneumonia and aspiration of gastric
contents, and distal organ injury including non-
pulmonary sepsis and major trauma.1 Despite sig-
nificant improvements in ventilation strategies and
fluid
management
there
remain
no
effective
pharmacological
therapies
in
routine
clinical
practice.2
As a neutrophil-dominant disorder, ARDS is
characterised by a dysregulated proinflammatory
environment, epithelial cell dysfunction and death,
pulmonary oedema, hyaline membrane formation
and hypoxia. Neutrophil migration into sites of
inflammation is a highly regulated and complex
process that is orchestrated by a variety of chemo-
tactic factors and receptors with increases in neu-
trophil number in ARDS associated with poorer
outcome.3
In addition to key, well described cytokines and
chemokines in the pathogenesis of ARDS,4 under-
standing of the importance and role of damage-
associated molecular patterns (DAMPs) is evolving.
These
include

Key messages
What is the key question?
▸ Are mitochondrial formylated peptides present
in acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS)
and does their signalling via formyl peptide
receptor 1 (FPR1) propagate sterile lung
inflammation?
What is the bottom line?
▸ For the first time, we have demonstrated that
mitochondrial formylated peptides are present
and elevated in ARDS and that they exert
effects through FPR1 to drive sterile lung
inflammation.
Why read on?
▸ Elevated levels of mitochondrial formylated
peptides in ARDS and their signalling via FPR1
to immune and lung parenchymal cells drives
acute lung injury, thereby highlighting a
potential novel therapeutic target.

 proteins,5 which serve to drive a variety of pathogenic mechan-
isms including increased cytokine expression, alveolar leak and
neutrophil migration. Targeting their cognate receptors has
therefore been proposed as a potential therapeutic approach.5 6
One group that remains unexplored in this context are
mitochondrial-derived DAMPs, namely CpG-rich mitochondrial
DNA (mtDNA) and formylated peptides, which are released
during cell death. Mitochondrial formylated peptides are of par-
ticular interest as much is known about their counterparts;
namely bacterial formylated peptides which bind to the G
protein-coupled receptor formyl peptide receptor 1 (FPR1).
This interaction drives neutrophil chemotaxis and stimulates a
variety of antimicrobial responses, including degranulation,
reactive oxygen species production and cytokine release. FPR1
deficiency results in increased bacterial burden and mortality in
models
of
systemic
Listeria
monocytogenes
infection
but,
despite this, the influence of FPR1 in pulmonary models of
infection is unclear.7–10 Due to proposed evolutionary symbiosis
mitochondrial-synthesised
peptides
within
eukaryotic
cells,
similar to bacterial peptides, contain a formylated N-terminus
and bind FPR1 with great affinity.11
FPR1 is potentially a key receptor within the acute inflamma-
tory process with the capacity to sense and respond to unique bac-
terial and host-derived factors. It is one member of the formyl
peptide receptor (FPR) family which in humans constitutes FPR1,
FPR2/ALX (lipoxin receptor) and FPR3. These are well conserved
G protein-coupled receptors that have pluripotent and diverse
roles in the initiation and resolution of inflammation.12 While
FPR1 has relatively specific binding to only formylated peptides,
Annexin A1 and Cathepsin G, FPR2 is a highly promiscuous
receptor which can bind a variety of lipids, peptides and proteins
to exert ligand-dependent pro-inflammatory or pro-resolution/
anti-inflammatory effects.13 Therefore, we have focused on the
dominant pro-inflammatory formyl peptide receptor, FPR1;
future work on FPR2 would be of interest especially when investi-
gating the resolution phases of inflammation. The role of FPR3,
however, is less clear and likely plays only a subtle role in inflam-
mation, although this still has to be fully elucidated.
Recent work has demonstrated that mitochondrial DAMPs
released following cell death play an important role in the context
of systemic sterile inflammation and are pivotal in neutrophil migra-
tion in liver injury
.14 15 Indeed, mtDNA is elevated in a variety of
disease contexts, including systemic inflammatory response syn-
drome, sepsis and acute acetaminophen overdose.14 16–19 Despite
these observations characterisation of the role of mitochondrial for-
mylated peptides and FPR1 in sterile inflammation remains limited,
particularly within the lung. No definitive evidence is currently
available for the presence and pathogenic role of mitochondrial for-
mylated peptides in pulmonary inflammation. Furthermore, while
FPR1 expression and function have characteristically been asso-
ciated with neutrophil expression, a role for FPR1 in lung paren-
chymal cell function in vivo is unknown.
In this study, we therefore developed a mass spectrometry
based method to determine the presence of mitochondrial for-
mylated peptides in ARDS. Subsequently, we investigated the
contribution of mitochondrial formylated peptides and FPR1
signalling in the pathogenesis of sterile lung inflammation in
mice and the influence of FPR1 expression in myeloid and par-
enchymal cells in this context.
MATERIALS AND METHODS
Clinical samples
Bronchoalveolar lavage fluid (BALF) and serum samples from
ventilated patients with ARDS in an intensive care setting and
healthy volunteers were collected as part of a previously
reported study.20 Clinical sample collection was approved by the
Lothian Research Ethics Committee (LREC/2002/8/19, 06/
S1101/50). Further details are provided within the online
supplementary methods.
Analysis of N-formylated mitochondrial peptides
Samples (mitochondria (MTD), BALF and serum) were analysed
by liquid chromatography–tandem mass spectrometry (LC-MS/
MS) with N-formylated peptides identified based on their accur-
ate mass, retention times and characteristic fragmentation pat-
terns compared with custom synthesised standards (Peptide
Protein Research Ltd, Fareham, UK).
Neutrophil isolation and surface marker expression
Peripheral blood neutrophils were isolated from healthy human
volunteers (Lothian Research Ethics Committee (#08/S1103/
38)) with cell purity routinely ≥95%.21 Cells were pretreated
with the FPR1 antagonist cyclosporin H (CsH) (2.5 μM, Enzo
Scientific, Exeter, UK) then stimulated with 100 nM fMIT
(fMMYALF; GenScript, Hong Kong), isolated MTD or vehicle
control for 30 min (37°C). Neutrophils were then incubated
with
antibodies
to
CD11b/CD18/CD62L
(all
BioLegend,
London, UK) prior to analysis by flow cytometry (BD FACS
Canto, BD Biosciences, Oxford, UK). Neutrophil chemotaxis
and
western
blotting
are
described
in
the
supplemental
methods.
Mouse models of lung inflammation
Female, 8–10 week old Fpr1−/− mice (C57/Bl6J background)
and wild type (WT) C57/Bl6 (Charles River or appropriate litter
mate controls) were used for all experiments and housed in
pathogen-free conditions. Animal work was carried out in

cological experiments intraperitoneal CsH (5 mg/kg) or vehicle

RESULTS
Mitochondrial N-formylated peptides are elevated in
patients with ARDS
LC-MS/MS was used to identify the previously described formy-
lated N-terminal hexapeptides of the 13 mitochondrial encoded
proteins.11 Initial studies focused on mitochondria isolated from
HepG2 cells. A full screen for free mitochondrial peptides
revealed
the
presence
of
N-formylated
termini
of
NADH-ubiquinone
oxidoreductase
chain
2
(NADH2;
fMNPLAQ) and NADH-ubiquinone oxidoreductase chain 4 L
(NADH4L; fMPLIYM).
Following the identification of free formylated N-terminal
peptides in mitochondria, the work was extended to BALF and
serum collected from patients with ARDS and appropriate
healthy volunteer subjects as part of a proof of principle study
(see online supplementary table S1). No significant difference in
the age or sex of volunteer subjects compared with patients with
ARDS was observed. The N-terminal hexapeptides from five of
the mitochondrial proteins were putatively identified in patient
samples (NADH subunits 2, 3 and 4, cytochrome b and ATP
synthase subunit 8). In each case, the mass to charge ratio (m/z)
and retention times of the peptides matched the synthetic stan-
dards; however, in the majority, MS/MS data were inconclusive.
The NADH2 hexapeptide was the only one to be detected in
BALF and serum from all samples from patients with ARDS.
The identity of this mitochondrial peptide was confirmed by de
novo sequencing by LC-MS/MS (figure 1A, B).
Quantification of the hexapeptide was undertaken by refer-
ence to a stable isotope-labelled internal standard (fMNP-[13C6,
15N]-LAQ). A calibration curve was constructed and found to
be linear over the biological range with a regression coefficient
of 0.997. LC-MS/MS analysis in plasma demonstrated a lower
limit of detection of 0.02 ng/mL. There was a significant eleva-
tion in fMNPLAQ in BALF and serum of patients with ARDS,
while in healthy volunteer subjects the hexapeptide was not
detected (figure 1C, D). In view of the mixed patient population
including four with positive bacterial culture of BALF fluid
(methicillin-resistant
Staphylococcus
aureus
(two
patients),
Klebsiella pneumoniae (one patient), Enterobacter cloacae (one
patient)) comparison of formylated peptide burden between
culture positive and negative patients was made. Importantly,
concomitant bacterial infection did not influence fMNPLAQ
concentration (see online supplementary figure S1A).
Given the spatial and biological associations between mito-
chondrial DNA (mtDNA) and formylated peptides both acting
as proinflammatory DAMPs, mtDNA was also quantified in a
smaller cohort, again as proof of principle. In keeping with the
elevated levels of mitochondrial formylated peptides, mitochon-
drial DNA was increased in BALF and serum of patients with
ARDS relative to healthy volunteers (see online supplementary
figure S1B, C).
Mitochondrial formylated peptides induce neutrophil
chemotaxis in vitro and in vivo
Neutrophil chemotaxis is a multistep process in which CD62L
(L-selectin) shedding is a prerequisite for rolling and firm adher-
ence to vessel walls with increase in surface integrin expression
facilitating subsequent transmigration. Assessment also serves as
a well described assessment of neutrophil activation. Both syn-
thetic mitochondrial formylated peptide (fMIT) and disrupted,
isolated MTD induced human neutrophil CD62L downregula-
tion and increased expression of the Mac-1 heterodimer CD11b
and CD18 in vitro (figure 2A–F
, see online supplementary
figure S2A–C). Pharmacological inhibition with cyclosporin H
(CsH), currently the most selective and potent FPR1 antagon-
ist,23 24 demonstrated that while not altering neutrophil pheno-
type in unstimulated cells (see online supplementary figure S3),
CsH inhibited fMIT/MTD-mediated increase in CD11b and
CD18 expression and CD62L downregulation (figure 2A–F, see
online supplementary figure S2). Similarly, fMIT and MTD
induced neutrophil chemotaxis—an effect abrogated by pre-
treatment with CsH (figure 2G, see online supplementary figure
S2D). With regards to intracellular signalling, MTD induced
phosphorylation of intracellular signalling proteins ERK, Akt
and p38, effects blocked by CsH (see online supplementary
figure S4A). Inhibition of ERK, p38 and PI3K but not Akt
resulted in reduced neutrophil surface expression of compo-
nents of CD11b and CD18 (see online supplementary figure
S4B–D).
T
o determine whether mitochondrial formylated peptide
induced migration was a Mac1-dependent process, neutrophils
preincubated with either anti-CD11b antibody or appropriate
isotype control were stimulated with MTD. Neutrophil migra-
tion was inhibited by the CD11b blocking antibody (figure 2H,
p=0.0093) demonstrating that, in vitro, mitochondrial formy-
lated peptide induced neutrophil chemotaxis is an FPR1/
Mac1-dependent process.
T
o establish whether mitochondrial formylated peptides play
a role in pulmonary neutrophil migration in vivo, fMIT was
administered into the lungs of WT mice. Alveolar neutrophil
numbers were significantly increased relative to vehicle control
after 12 hours (figure 2I). Importantly, KC/CXCL1, the chemo-
kine classically associated with pulmonary neutrophil recruit-
ment, was undetectable in both groups (data not shown),
indicating
alternative
signalling
mechanisms
for
neutrophil
migration. In Fpr1−/− mice the fMIT-induced alveolar neutro-
phil number was markedly reduced compared with WT animals
(figure 2I, J).
FPR1 is essential for neutrophil-dependent sterile lung
injury in mice
T
o establish whether the FPR1-dependent alveolar neutrophil
migration observed in response to mitochondrial formylated
peptides was present in a disease context we utilised a model of
hydrochloric acid induced lung injury. Acid-induced injury is
regarded as a clinically relevant rodent model of acute lung
injury mimicking the effects of acid aspiration of gastric con-
tents. This model also allows determination of the role of mito-
chondrial formylated peptides in sterile inflammation and in an
environment devoid of bacterial formylated peptides.25–27
Following instillation of intratracheal acid, there was evidence
of host tissue damage and release of MTD with peak mtDNA
levels observed 6 hours post injury (see online supplementary
figure S5A). Alveolar neutrophil influx was greatest 24 hours
after injury (see online supplementary figure S5B). Following
acid-induced injury, Fpr1−/− mice had a marked reduction in
total alveolar cell number and neutrophil numbers within the
alveolar and interstitial lung compartments relative to WT
animals (figure 3A–D). Importantly, no difference in circulating
neutrophil numbers was observed (figure 3E). Similarly, no dif-
ferences
in
alveolar,
interstitial
or
circulating
neutrophil
numbers were seen between naïve Fpr1−/− and WT mice (see
online supplementary figure S6). In keeping with the in vitro
observation
of
Mac-1-dependent
migration,

(figure 3F).
Analysis of BALF demonstrated a reduction in pulmonary vas-
cular leak with reduced soluble IgM levels in Fpr1−/− mice
(figure 3G). The protective phenotype in these animals was
further highlighted as the proinflammatory cytokines TNFα and
MIP2
were
reduced
in

Fpr1−/−

(figure 3H, I). Histological analysis of H&E-stained lung sec-
tions demonstrated reduced haemorrhage in Fpr1−/− mice

ciated with chemokine and cytokine mediated migration with

with

infiltration and activation of the stromal derived factor 1
(SDF1)/CXCR4 axis. Bone marrow recruited neutrophils, char-
acteristic of late phase recruitment, often display a blunted
chemotactic response to factors including the bacterial formy-
lated peptide fMLF.28–30 To determine whether the reduction in
alveolar neutrophil recruitment observed at 24 hours was solely
as a result of inhibition of early phase recruitment, or whether
FPR1 was implicated in the second phase of neutrophil recruit-
ment, FPR1 antagonism was pharmacologically achieved with
intraperitoneal CsH administered before and after the onset of
lung injury. In keeping with results from acid injury to Fpr1−/−
mice, pretreatment with CsH resulted in reduced alveolar neu-
trophil
number and
TNFα
expression
(figure
4A–C).

 determine the effect of FPR1 antagonism on late phase neutro-
phil recruitment the antagonist was delivered 12 hours after acid
injury (without pretreatment). Again, alveolar neutrophils were
reduced relative to vehicle control treated mice (figure 4D–F).
This reduction in neutrophil number (72.6% of control) is
equivalent to that seen in mice pretreated with CsH (52.6%)
and Fpr1−/− animals (69.8%), suggesting that the role of FPR1
in late phase recruitment is as important as it is in early phase
migration when chemokines and MTD levels are at their peak
(see online supplementary figure S5).
FPR1 is present on pulmonary epithelium and contributes to
lung injury
Development of pulmonary oedema is multifaceted but key con-
tributors include neutrophils, endothelial cells and alveolar epi-
thelial cells. Depletion of neutrophils alone is sufficient to
ameliorate protein leak in preclinical models of lung injury,28 31
however there is increasing awareness of the role of parenchy-
mal FPR1 expression and function in the context of acute
colonic inflammation.32 W
e therefore characterised mouse lung
epithelial FPR1 expression. Lungs of WT mice were collagenase
digested, epithelial cells isolated and RNA extracted (see online
supplementary figure S7) with FPR1 mRNA expression demon-
strated by RT-PCR (figure 5A). Additionally, FPR1 protein was
detected by immunohistochemistry in alveolar epithelial cells, as
well as resident alveolar macrophages (figure 5B). Staining was
absent in Fpr1−/− lung sections.
As alveolar epithelial and endothelial cell function plays an
important contributory role in the development of pulmonary
oedema in acute lung injury,1 we sought to determine the con-
tribution
of
parenchymal
FPR1
function
in
this
process.
Four-way Fpr1−/− and WT bone marrow chimeras were gener-
ated with acid-induced lung injury occurring 6 weeks after
re-engraftment. Alveolar protein leak as assessed by total
protein quantification and IgM within BALF demonstrated that
myeloid and parenchymal FPR1 expression contribute to this
process (figure 5C, D). Similarly, global loss of FPR1 appears
necessary for reduction in neutrophil number. No difference in
alveolar monocyte/macrophage number was observed between
the groups (figure 5E–H).
Figure 2
Mitochondrial formylated peptides alter adhesion molecule expression and chemotaxis in human neutrophils via a formyl peptide
receptor 1 (FPR1)/Mac1-dependent mechanism and induce FPR1-dependent neutrophil recruitment in vivo. Mitochondrial formylated peptides
(fMIT, 100 nM) induced CD62L shedding (A,B) and increased CD11b (C,D) and CD18 (E,F) expression as assessed by flow cytometry—effects that
were inhibited by CsH (2.5 μM) (n=4 separate donors) (histograms—dotted line, control; blue line, fMIT; red line, fMIT/CsH). Neutrophil chemotaxis
was increased in response to fMIT but inhibited by CsH (G) while anti-CD11b blocking antibody inhibited neutrophil migration towards isolated
mitochondria (H), result expressed relative to transmigrated neutrophils treated with isotype control (n=3 separate donors). Administration of

 DISCUSSION
Formylated peptides of bacterial and mitochondrial origin span
the aetiological divides between sterile and infection-related
diseases that contribute to ARDS. Delineation of their presence
and the functional importance of their signalling through FPR1
in the pathogenesis of sterile lung inflammation is however
required. In the context of pulmonary inflammation, Fpr1−/−
mice are protected from cigarette smoking induced emphysema-
tous changes, with associated reduction in neutrophil and
macrophage number.33 Furthermore, a model of endotoxin-
induced lung injury demonstrated a protective phenotype for
Fpr1−/− mice.34 These studies propose an association with
exogenous bacterial formylated peptides but no exploration of
the effects of endogenous mitochondrial formylated peptides
has been described in models of direct pulmonary injury.
Within the alveolar space, extracellular proteins are degraded
by proteolytic enzymes both native to the environment and lib-
erated by cell death during lung injury. While the presence of
extracellular mitochondrial peptides acting as DAMPs has been
surmised from the identification of free mitochondrial DNA,14
Fpr1−/− mouse studies,15 and in vitro observations on human
neutrophils35 there has, to our knowledge, been no previous
attempt to identify the functionally active formylated N-termini
of these peptides within patient samples. Given the binding
affinity of peptides to FPR1 is predominantly governed by the
presence of a formylated methionine N-terminal amino acid
determining this moiety’s presence, and preservation in the
context of extracellular proteolytic enzymes, it is important in
delineating the peptides’ biological activity.
Through LC-MS/MS analysis we identified the hexapeptide
formylated N-terminus of NADH2, one of the 13 proteins
encoded by the mitochondrial genome, and translated within
the organelle. Furthermore, NADH2 was present in all patients
with ARDS in both alveolar lavage fluid and the systemic circu-
lation but undetectable in all healthy volunteer subjects in this
proof of principle study. This therefore provides evidence that
mitochondrial N-terminal formylated peptides are present in
acute inflammatory disease and have the potential to interact
with FPR1.
Considering the infective aetiology of some of the ARDS
cohort, we were initially concerned that the formylated peptides
detected in the clinical samples may arise from bacterial contam-
ination rather than mitochondrial origin. BLAST searching
showed some sequence similarities to bacterial proteins but this
may be simply due to the high conservation of the peptide
sequence motif. Further, the majority identified are hypothetical
proteins while the BLAST search also gives no indication as to
whether the protein has been subjected to post-translational

Several
independent
factors reassured us that bacterial contamination contributing to
formylated peptide detection was unlikely. First, no difference
in formylated peptide levels was observed between sterile and
culture-positive BALF samples. Second, cultures of healthy vol-
unteer BALF samples frequently grew mixed oral commensals
up to levels equivalent to those of the bacterial culture positive
samples from patients with ARDS. Despite this, detectable for-
mylated peptides were only present in the latter group. Third,
the primers used for mtDNA PCR do not amplify bacterial
DNA.14 Using these primers mtDNA was similarly elevated in
the ARDS cohort. Fourth, the fMNPLAQ peptide was readily
detected in the mitochondria isolated from sterile HepG2 cells.
Taken together, we are satisfied that these separate observa-
tions support the conclusion that it is eukaryotic-derived mito-
chondrial peptides which are being detected and quantified.
Further refinement of this methodological approach will be
required to accurately determine global formylated peptide
burden, which in turn should be applied to a larger mixed
patient cohort to dissect detailed association with risk stratifi-
cation or prognostic outcome. Larger sample size will also
serve to address the limited number of patients included in this
present study.
Although instinctively attributable to attenuation of neutro-
phil influx, the observed reduction in alveolar leak in Fpr1−/−
mice may well be multifactorial. Neutrophil migration across
endothelial and epithelial barriers with release of histotoxic
mediators is alone sufficient to induce tissue oedema and pul-
monary haemorrhage. Despite evidence of cellular crosstalk
with innate inflammatory cells, the exact dynamics and key con-
tributors to intrinsic alveolar epithelial cell dysfunction in the
pathogenesis of ARDS remain poorly understood.1 The role of
FPR1 in colonic epithelial homeostasis32 and formylated pep-
tides in bronchial epithelial migration and contraction36 37 and
systemic vascular tone38 has recently been described. This high-
lights the influence of FPR1 function on epithelial function, sug-
gesting its possible direct involvement in modulating alveolar
epithelial permeability.
T
o determine the presence of FPR1 in mouse pulmonary epi-
thelial cells, immunohistochemical staining of naïve mouse lung
sections and RT-PCR of mRNA extracted from isolated lung
epithelial cells were performed. Both demonstrated the presence
of epithelial FPR1. To subsequently ascertain the relative contri-
bution of myeloid and parenchymal FPR1 expression in the
development of sterile acute lung injury bone marrow chimeras
were made. Neutrophil influx and alveolar protein leak were

 reduced in only those mice with global FPR1 absence, demon-
strating that myeloid and parenchymal cells contribute to lung
inflammation. This observation is similar to recent work demon-
strating that global MyD88 expression is required for neutrophil
recruitment and bacterial clearance in a Streptococcus pneumo-
niae model of pulmonary infection through KC/CXCL1 and
MIP2 dependent mechanisms.39
CONCLUSION
Neutrophil migration is a highly orchestrated and regulated
process dependent upon crosstalk between multiple cell types
through a vast array of mediators and cell surface receptors.
Viewed by the host as pathogenic mediators akin to those released
by their bacterial ancestors, mitochondrial formylated peptides
through pluripotent effects mediated by FPR1 may well be princi-
pal conductors in this inflammatory process. W
e have provided,
for the first time, direct evidence of N-terminal formylated mito-
chondrial peptides in human disease with detection of peptides in
the BALF and circulation of patient with ARDS. In concert with
this, FPR1 is involved in neutrophil recruitment and alveolar leak
in response to sterile injury. While mitochondrial formylated pep-
tides induce direct, KC/CXCL1-independent, neutrophil migration
in vivo, FPR1 mediates neutrophil-independent effects through
parenchymal cells by mechanisms that are yet to be fully eluci-
dated. T
ogether, these data demonstrate that FPR1 warrants
further examination and investigation as a potential therapeutic
target in sterile lung inflammation.

Formyl peptide receptor 1 (FPR1) is expressed on pulmonary epithelial cells with myeloid and parenchymal cell FPR1 contributing to
neutrophil recruitment and alveolar protein leak during lung injury. Expression of epithelial FPR1 was determined by RT-PCR (A; 1–3=separate mice;
ntc—no template control) of flow sorted mouse epithelial cells (EpCam1/E-cadherin positive) and immunohistochemistry (×1000 magnification) on
mouse lung sections (B; representative images n=3 per group). Following re-engraftment bone marrow chimaeras (WT & Fpr1−/−) were injured with
intratracheal HCl. Bronchoalveolar lavage fluid (BALF) total protein (C) and IgM (D) were quantified 24 hours after injury. Total BALF cell number (F)
and neutrophil (G) and monocyte/macrophage count (H) were assessed (representative cytocentrifuge preparations of WT/WT and Fpr/Fpr BALF
shown; ×400 magnification (E)). n=3–6/group *p<0.05, **p<0.001, one-way ANOVA.
