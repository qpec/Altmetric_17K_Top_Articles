BACKGROUND
Intravenous sodium bicarbonate and oral acetylcysteine are widely used to prevent 
acute kidney injury and associated adverse outcomes after angiography without 
definitive evidence of their efficacy.
METHODS
Using a 2-by-2 factorial design, we randomly assigned 5177 patients at high risk 
for renal complications who were scheduled for angiography to receive intravenous 
1.26% sodium bicarbonate or intravenous 0.9% sodium chloride and 5 days of oral 
acetylcysteine or oral placebo; of these patients, 4993 were included in the modi-
fied intention-to-treat analysis. The primary end point was a composite of death, 
the need for dialysis, or a persistent increase of at least 50% from baseline in the 
serum creatinine level at 90 days. Contrast-associated acute kidney injury was a 
secondary end point.
RESULTS
The sponsor stopped the trial after a prespecified interim analysis. There was no 
interaction between sodium bicarbonate and acetylcysteine with respect to the pri-
mary end point (P 
= 
0.33). The primary end point occurred in 110 of 2511 patients 
(4.4%) in the sodium bicarbonate group as compared with 116 of 2482 (4.7%) in the 
sodium chloride group (odds ratio, 0.93; 95% confidence interval [CI], 0.72 to 1.22; 
P 
= 
0.62) and in 114 of 2495 patients (4.6%) in the acetylcysteine group as compared 
with 112 of 2498 (4.5%) in the placebo group (odds ratio, 1.02; 95% CI, 0.78 to 1.33; 
P 
= 
0.88). There were no significant between-group differences in the rates of con-
trast-associated acute kidney injury.
CONCLUSIONS
Among patients at high risk for renal complications who were undergoing angiog-
raphy, there was no benefit of intravenous sodium bicarbonate over intravenous 
sodium chloride or of oral acetylcysteine over placebo for the prevention of death, 
need for dialysis, or persistent decline in kidney function at 90 days or for the 
prevention of contrast-associated acute kidney injury. (Funded by the U.S. Depart-

The new engl and jour nal of medicine
A
cute kidney injury associated with 
the administration of contrast material 
during angiography can result in death, 
accelerated progression of underlying chronic 
kidney disease, and the need for dialysis, along 
with substantial increases in health care costs.1-3 
The periprocedural administration of intravenous 
isotonic sodium chloride has been the standard 
intervention to prevent this complication.4 On the 
basis of hypotheses that urinary alkalinization 
and scavenging of reactive oxygen species mitigate 
renal tubular epithelial-cell injury from the use 
of iodinated contrast material, multiple studies 
have compared intravenous sodium bicarbonate 
with intravenous sodium chloride and have evalu-
ated treatment with acetylcysteine for the preven-
tion of contrast-associated acute kidney injury, 
with inconsistent results.5-11 Consequently, equi-
poise exists regarding these interventions, despite 
their widespread use in clinical practice. We de-
signed the Prevention of Serious Adverse Events 
Following Angiography (PRESERVE) trial to com-
pare intravenous sodium bicarbonate with intra-
venous sodium chloride and oral acetylcysteine 
with oral placebo for the prevention of major 
adverse outcomes and acute kidney injury in a 
large population of high-risk patients undergoing 
coronary or noncoronary angiography.
Methods
Trial Design and Oversight
The trial was a double-blind, placebo and com-
parator-drug–controlled, randomized trial spon-
sored by the U.S. Department of Veterans Affairs 
Cooperative Studies Program and the George In-
stitute for Global Health. From February 2013 
through March 2017, patients were enrolled at 
53 medical centers in the United States (35 Vet-
erans Affairs sites), Australia (13 sites), Malaysia 
(3 sites), and New Zealand (2 sites). The design 
of the trial has been described previously.12 The 
trial protocol and statistical analysis plan are 
available with the full text of this article at 
NEJM.org. The trial was funded by the Veterans 
Affairs Office of Research and Development and 
the National Health and Medical Research Coun-
cil of Australia.
The trial was approved by the Veterans Affairs 
central institutional review board and by relevant 
ethics committees and regulatory authorities at 
sites not overseen by the Department of Veterans 
Affairs. An independent data and safety monitor-
ing committee met twice a year for the duration 
of the trial. Trial authors at the data coordinating 
center had access to the final results and vouch 
for the accuracy and completeness of the data 
and analyses. All the authors vouch for the adher-
ence of the trial to the protocol. The first author 
drafted the manuscript, which was reviewed and 
approved by all the authors, who made the deci-
sion to submit the manuscript for publication. 
The Veterans Affairs Cooperative Studies Program 
reviewed the manuscript but did not influence the 
interpretation of the trial results or the decision 
to submit the manuscript for publication. Baxter 
Healthcare provided matched, prepackaged bags 
of sodium bicarbonate and sodium chloride at 
cost but was not involved in the design or conduct 
of the trial, data analysis, manuscript preparation, 
or manuscript review.
Trial Population
Patients who were scheduled to undergo coronary 
or noncoronary angiography and who had an es-
timated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) of 15 to 
44.9 ml per minute per 1.73 m2 of body-surface 
area or 45 to 59.9 ml per minute per 1.73 m2 
among those with diabetes mellitus were eligible 
to participate. The eGFR that was used to deter-
mine eligibility was calculated with the use of 
the four-variable Modification of Diet in Renal 
Disease Study equation on the basis of creatinine 
levels obtained locally within 30 days before an-
giography.13 We excluded patients who were un-
dergoing emergency angiography and those with 
unstable baseline levels of blood creatinine (which 
was defined as an increase or decrease of ≥25% 
within 3 days before angiography). A complete list 
of inclusion and exclusion criteria is provided in 
Table S1 in the Supplementary Appendix, avail-
able at NEJM.org. All the patients provided writ-
ten informed consent.
Randomization, Interventions,  
and Kidney-Function Measures
Using a two-by-two factorial design, we randomly 
assigned eligible patients to receive intravenous 
1.26% sodium bicarbonate (150 mmol per liter) 
or intravenous 0.9% sodium chloride (154 mmol 
per liter) in matched 1-liter bags (Baxter Health-
care), and oral acetylcysteine capsules (prepared 
using bulk powder from Moehs Catalana) or 
matched placebo capsules. Randomization was

Angiography with Sodium Bicarbonate and Acetylcysteine
performed by means of a centralized, computer-
generated permuted-block plan and was stratified 
according to trial site. The patients and trial inves-
tigators were unaware of trial-group assignments.
The administration of trial intravenous fluids 
was based on protocol-specified ranges: 1 to 3 ml 
per kilogram of body weight per hour during a 
period of 1 to 12 hours for a total volume of 3 to 
12 ml per kilogram before angiography, 1 to 
1.5 ml per kilogram per hour during angiogra-
phy, and 1 to 3 ml per kilogram per hour during 
a period of 2 to 12 hours for a total volume of 
6 to 12 ml per kilogram after angiography. 
Within these specific parameters, the providers 
at trial sites determined the timing of initiation, 
duration, and rate of fluid administration. In pa-
tients with a body-mass index (the weight in 
kilograms divided by the square of the height in 
meters) of more than 30, we capped fluid-admin-
istration rates on the basis of a weight of 125 kg. 
We administered 1200 mg of oral acetylcysteine 
or matched placebo approximately 1 hour before 
angiography and again 1 hour after angiography. 
Patients were instructed to continue to take 
1200 mg of acetylcysteine or matched placebo 
twice daily for the following 4 days for a total of 
10 doses.
We collected a blood sample from each patient 
before the initiation of trial intravenous fluids 
(baseline) and at 3 to 5 days and 90 to 104 days 
after angiography. Among patients who did not 
provide a blood sample at 90 to 104 days, we 
continued to attempt to obtain the sample through 
day 180. We shipped specimens obtained from all 
patients at Veterans Affairs sites to a centralized 
trial laboratory (Advanced Bio Medical Labs), 
where serum creatinine was measured simulta-
neously in all three samples for each patient by 
means of an isotope dilution mass spectrometry 
(IDMS) traceable assay. Serum creatinine mea-
surements of samples obtained from patients at 
George Institute sites were performed locally 
with the use of an IDMS traceable assay. We col-
lected urine for local measurement of albumin 
and creatinine at the time of angiography and for 
pH measurement 2 to 4 hours after angiography.
Trial End Points
The primary end point was a composite of death, 
the need for dialysis, or a persistent increase of 
at least 50% from baseline in the serum creatinine 
level at 90 to 104 days after angiography and 
confirmed at subsequent testing within 14 days 
(defined as persistent impairment in kidney func-
tion). We ascertained death and the need for di-
alysis by reviewing electronic medical records and 
all hospitalizations within 90 days after angiogra-
phy and by interviewing patients or family mem-
bers. The subsequent creatinine testing was per-
formed by means of the same method that was 
used in testing of the original sample.
Secondary end points were contrast-associat-
ed acute kidney injury, which was defined as an 
increase in serum creatinine of either at least 
25% or at least 0.5 mg per deciliter (44 μmol per 
liter) from baseline at 3 to 5 days after angiog-
raphy; death within 90 days; dialysis of any kind 
within 90 days; confirmed persistent kidney im-
pairment at 90 to 104 days; hospitalization with 
acute coronary syndrome, heart failure, or stroke 
within 90 days; and hospitalization for any cause 
within 90 days.
Statistical Analysis
We used a modified intention-to-treat analysis 
that included all the patients who had undergone 
randomization and who had received the as-
signed trial interventions, regardless of whether 
they had undergone angiography. Excluded from 
this analysis were patients who had not received 
the trial interventions and had not undergone 
angiography. We estimated that 7680 patients 
would need to be enrolled for the trial to have a 
power of 90% to detect a decrease in the rate of 
the primary end point from 8.7% to 6.5% for each 
trial intervention, assuming a 3% loss to follow-up 
and no interaction between the trial interven-
tions.12
We compared baseline and procedural character-
istics between the sodium bicarbonate group and the 
sodium chloride group and between the acetyl-
cysteine group and the placebo group using the 
t-test for normally distributed continuous vari-
ables, the Wilcoxon rank-sum test for variables 
without a normal distribution, and the chi-square 
test for categorical variables. To test the interac-
tion between sodium bicarbonate and acetylcys-
teine, we used a multivariable logistic-regression 
model that included the two randomized treat-
ments and their interaction as parameters. In the 
analysis of the primary and secondary end points, 
a P value of less than 0.05 on the Wald chi-square 
test was considered to indicate statistical signifi-
cance for the interaction term and to determine

its inclusion or exclusion in the final logistic-
regression model. We performed a stepwise proce-
dure to confirm the results of interaction testing.
In a prespecified interim analysis, we per-
formed the O’Brien–Fleming multiple-testing pro-
cedure after approximately 50% of the expected 
number of patients had been followed through 
90 days. At the time of the interim analysis, we 
used the group sequential method to estimate the 
conditional power of a two-proportions test ac-
cording to the rate of the primary end point in 
which we considered three different scenarios of 
accrual of new primary events across the inter-
vention groups, with the alpha levels for each of 
the scenarios set at 0.048 and 0.024.14 We al-
lowed for an overall two-sided type I error of 
2.5% for each hypothesis being tested. Hence, 
the interim hypotheses were tested at a P value 
of 0.001, and the final hypotheses at a P value of 
0.024. We also conducted exploratory analyses 
among prespecified subgroups, according to eGFR 
stratum, the presence of diabetes, albuminuria 
stratum, contrast volume, type of angiography, 
and country (United States vs. Australia, New Zea-
land, and Malaysia). Tests for all outcomes were 
two-sided. Statistical analyses were performed 
with the use of SAS software, version 9.4 (SAS 
Institute).
Results
Patients
From February 2013 through March 2017, a total 
of 5177 patients (4441 at Veterans Affairs sites 
and 736 at George Institute sites) underwent ran-
domization. A total of 184 patients (3.6%) were 
withdrawn after randomization (because of can-
cellation of angiography before receipt of the 
trial interventions in 144 patients and withdrawal 
of consent in 40), which resulted in a primary 
analysis group of 4993 patients; this group in-
cluded 56 patients (1.1%) who had received trial 
interventions but had not undergone angiogra-
phy. Reasons for nonenrollment of screened pa-
tients are summarized in Figure S1 in the Sup-
plementary Appendix.
At the preplanned interim analysis, the data 
and safety monitoring committee recommended 
to the Veterans Affairs Cooperative Studies Pro-
gram that enrollment in the trial be stopped on 
the basis of the absence of between-group dif-
ference in the rate of the primary end point for 
each comparison between interventions in the 
modified intention-to-treat analysis and results 
indicating that even with complete enrollment, 
the conditional power would be 5.2% at an alpha 
level of 0.024 and 11.3% at an alpha level of 0.048 
if all new primary events occurred at the ob-
served rates only in the control groups. The 
Veterans Affairs Cooperative Studies Program 
accepted this recommendation and instructed 
the executive committee to stop enrollment as 
of March 31, 2017.
Baseline Characteristics
Of the 4993 patients, we randomly assigned 2511 
to receive sodium bicarbonate, 2482 to receive 
sodium chloride, 2495 to receive acetylcysteine, 
and 2498 to receive placebo (Fig. 1). The mean 
(±SD) age of the patients was 69.8±8.2 years; 4671 
patients (93.6%) were men, and 4041 (80.9%) had 
diabetes mellitus. At baseline, the median serum 
creatinine level was 1.5 mg per deciliter (inter-
quartile range, 1.3 to 1.8 [133 μmol per liter; 
interquartile range, 115 to 159]), and the median 
eGFR was 50.2 ml per minute per 1.73 m2 (inter-
quartile range, 41.1 to 59.4). There were more 
Hispanic patients assigned to the sodium bicar-
bonate group than to the sodium chloride group 
(4.3% vs. 2.9%, P 
= 
0.008). There were no other 
significant differences in any baseline character-
istics between the trial groups (Table 1, and Table 
S2 in the Supplementary Appendix) or across the 
four treatment combination groups (Table S3 in 
the Supplementary Appendix).
Procedural Characteristics and Adherence 
to Trial Interventions
Of the 4937 patients who underwent angiography, 
4466 (90.5%) underwent coronary angiography, 
and 471 (9.5%) underwent noncoronary angiog-
raphy; 1406 (28.5%) also underwent percutaneous 
intervention. The median volume of contrast mate-
rial that was administered was 85 ml (interquartile 
range, 55 to 137). Procedural characteristics were 
similar in the trial groups (Table 1, and Table S2 
in the Supplementary Appendix) and across the 
four treatment combination groups (Table S3 in 
the Supplementary Appendix).
The median volume of trial intravenous fluid 
that was administered was 344 ml (interquartile 
range, 274 to 444) before angiography, 114 ml 
(interquartile range, 74 to 170) during angiogra-
phy, and 570 ml (interquartile range, 472 to 670)

Angiography with Sodium Bicarbonate and Acetylcysteine
after angiography; the volumes of sodium bicar-
bonate and sodium chloride and durations of 
administration were similar in the trial groups 
(Table S4 in the Supplementary Appendix). After 
angiography, the mean urine pH value was 
6.7±0.8 in the sodium bicarbonate group and 
6.0±0.8 in the sodium chloride group (P<0.001). 
Overall, 4050 of 4993 patients (81.1%) adhered 
to the prescribed regimen of acetylcysteine and 
placebo capsules, with similar rates of adherence 
in the two trial groups (Table S5 in the Supplemen-
tary Appendix). There were no significant differ-
ences in serious adverse events across the trial 
groups (Table 2, and Table S6 in the Supplemen-
tary Appendix).
Primary End Point
There was no significant interaction between so-
dium bicarbonate and acetylcysteine (P 
= 
0.33), so 
the interaction term was excluded from the final 
logistic-regression model. The absence of signifi-
cant interaction was confirmed with the use of a 
stepwise procedure (Table S7 in the Supplemen-
tary Appendix). The primary composite end point 
occurred in 110 patients (4.4%) in the sodium 
bicarbonate group as compared with 116 patients 
(4.7%) in the sodium chloride group (odds ratio, 
0.93; 95% confidence interval [CI], 0.72 to 1.22; 
P 
= 
0.62), and in 114 patients (4.6%) in the acet-
ylcysteine group as compared with 112 (4.5%) in 
the placebo group (odds ratio, 1.02; 95% CI, 0.78 
to 1.33; P 
= 
0.88) (Table 3). There were no signifi-
cant differences in the primary composite end 
point in the comparison of treatment combina-
tion groups (Table S8 in the Supplementary Ap-
pendix). There were no significant differences in 
the primary composite end point in any prespeci-
fied subgroup in the comparison of sodium bicar-

Angiography with Sodium Bicarbonate and Acetylcysteine
bonate with sodium chloride or in the compari-
son of acetylcysteine with placebo, other than 
among the patients who had undergone noncoro-
nary angiography, in whom sodium bicarbonate 
was associated with a higher risk of the primary 
composite end point than was sodium chloride, 
without adjustment for multiple comparisons 
(odds ratio, 3.19; 95% CI, 1.03 to 9.94) (Fig. 2). 
There was also no benefit with either interven-
tion when the persistent kidney impairment com-
ponent of the primary end point was defined 
solely on the basis of the serum creatinine sample 
obtained at 90 to 104 days after angiography with-
out the confirmatory sample (Table S9 in the 
Supplementary Appendix).
Secondary End Points
The interaction between sodium bicarbonate and 
acetylcysteine with respect to contrast-associated 
acute kidney injury was not significant (P 
= 
0.46) 
and was excluded from the final logistic-regres-
sion model. Contrast-associated acute kidney in-
jury occurred in 239 patients (9.5%) in the sodium 
bicarbonate group as compared with 206 (8.3%) 
in the sodium chloride group (odds ratio, 1.16; 
95% CI, 0.96 to 1.41; P 
= 
0.13) and in 228 patients 
(9.1%) in the acetylcysteine group as compared 
with 217 (8.7%) in the placebo group (odds ratio, 
1.06; 95% CI, 0.87 to 1.28; P 
= 
0.58) (Table 3). 
There were no significant differences in contrast-
associated acute kidney injury in the comparison 
of treatment combination groups (Table S8 in the 
Supplementary Appendix) or in any of the pre-
specified subgroups in the comparison between 
sodium bicarbonate and sodium chloride or in 
the comparison between acetylcysteine and place-
bo (Fig. 2). There were no significant differences in 
the incidence of any of the other secondary end 
points in the comparisons between sodium bi-
carbonate and sodium chloride or in the compari-
sons between acetylcysteine and placebo (Table 3).
Discussion
In this multinational, randomized, controlled trial 
in patients with chronic kidney disease who were 
undergoing angiography, we found no benefit of 
intravenous sodium bicarbonate over intravenous 
sodium chloride or of oral acetylcysteine over oral 
placebo for the prevention of death, need for di-
alysis, or persistent kidney impairment at 90 days 
or for the prevention of contrast-associated acute 
kidney injury or other secondary end points.
Multiple previous trials and meta-analyses that 
have compared sodium bicarbonate with sodium 
chloride and evaluated acetylcysteine for the pre-
vention of contrast-associated acute kidney injury 
have shown inconsistent results.5-11,15,16 Despite 
equipoise regarding the effectiveness of these 
treatments, they are widely used in clinical prac-

The primary end point was a composite of death, the need for dialysis, or a persistent increase of at least 50% from baseline in the serum creatinine level at 90 days. Data regarding 90-
day creatinine levels were missing in 119 patients (4.7%) in the sodium bicarbonate group, 103 (4.1%) in the sodium chloride group, 105 (4.2%) in the acetylcysteine group, and 117 
(4.7%) in the placebo group.
†  
Contrast-associated acute kidney injury was defined as an increase in serum creatinine of at least 25% or at least 0.5 mg per deciliter (44 μmol per liter) from baseline at 3 to 5 days af-
ter angiography. Data regarding serum creatinine levels on days 3 to 5 were missing in 212 patients (8.4%) in the sodium bicarbonate group, 229 (9.2%) in the sodium chloride group, 
210 (8.4%) in the acetylcysteine group, and 231 (9.2%) in the placebo group.

Figure 2. Forest Plot of Treatment Effects in Prespecified Subgroup Analyses.
Shown are odds ratios (squares) with 95% confidence intervals (horizontal lines) and P values for the interactions between each sub-
group variable with respect to the primary end point and contrast-associated acute kidney injury for the comparisons between sodium 
bicarbonate and sodium chloride and between acetylcysteine and placebo. The primary end point was a composite of death, the need 
for dialysis, or a persistent increase of at least 50% from baseline in the serum creatinine level at 90 days. Contrast-associated acute kid-
ney injury was defined as an increase in serum creatinine of at least 25% or at least 0.5 mg per deciliter (44 μmol per liter) from baseline 
at 3 to 5 days after angiography. The albumin-to-creatinine ratio (ACR) was calculated with albumin measured in milligrams and creati-
nine measured in grams. GFR denotes glomerular filtration rate.

tice.17 However, most trials of these interventions 
have been underpowered.18 Our trial was stopped 
after the enrollment of 5177 patients of a planned 
cohort of 7680 (67.4%); of the patients who had 
undergone randomization, 4993 were included 
in the primary analysis. Even so, our trial popula-
tion was more than twice as large as the popula-
tion in the largest previous trial of acetylcysteine 
and much larger than the populations in all the 
previous trials of intravenous sodium bicarbon-
ate.6,19 Unlike most previous trials in which the 
primary end point was a small increase in the 
blood creatinine level occurring within days af-
ter the intravascular administration of contrast 
material, our primary end point was a composite 
of serious adverse outcomes that are recognized 
sequelae of acute kidney injury and we analyzed 
contrast-associated acute kidney injury only as a 
secondary end point.16,20,21 Small, short-term 
changes in creatinine levels after the administra-
tion of contrast material are associated with pro-
gressive chronic kidney disease, cardiovascular 
complications, and death; however, several pre-
vious trials have not shown decreased mortality 
or decreased need for dialysis despite reductions 
in contrast-associated acute kidney injury with 
the use of sodium bicarbonate or of acetylcyste-
ine.22-24 Consequently, our finding that the use of 
sodium bicarbonate and acetylcysteine did not 
reduce the incidence of our primary or secondary 
end points supports the strong likelihood that 
these interventions are not clinically effective in 
preventing acute kidney injury or longer-term ad-
verse outcomes after angiography.
We restricted our study population to patients 
with stage 3 or 4 chronic kidney disease (eGFR of 
30 to 59.9 ml per minute per 1.73 m2 for stage 3 
and 15 to 29.9 ml per minute per 1.73 m2 for 
stage 4); those with stage 3A (eGFR of 45 to 59.9 ml 
per minute per 1.73 m2) were required to have 
diabetes mellitus, a condition that increases the 
risk of contrast-associated acute kidney injury in 
patients with impaired kidney function.25 Con-
versely, patients with normal or nearly normal 
kidney function have been included in several 
previous trials of these interventions, including 
the Acetylcysteine for Contrast-Induced Nephrop-
athy Trial (ACT).26-29 Of the 2308 patients who 
were enrolled in ACT, more than half had a base-
line eGFR of more than 60 ml per minute per 
1.73 m2.19 Although ACT showed no benefit as-
sociated with acetylcysteine for the prevention of 
contrast-associated acute kidney injury, death, or 
the need for dialysis at 30 days, the inclusion of 
many patients with preserved kidney function lim-
ited the generalizability of the results among pa-
tients at higher risk for acute kidney injury and 
associated adverse outcomes.19
Our trial has certain limitations. First, the 
use of a primary end point that was assessed at 
90 days created the possibility that any benefit 
of the interventions might have been masked by 
intervening events (e.g., coronary-artery bypass 
surgery). However, this possibility was markedly 
diminished by the absence of benefit with respect 
to contrast-associated acute kidney injury for either 
study intervention. Second, to assess contrast-asso-
ciated acute kidney injury, we measured serum 
creatinine at a single time point after angiogra-
phy. Consequently, patients with earlier transient 
decrements in kidney function could have been 
missed. Third, since we recruited most of the trial 
patients from Veterans Affairs hospitals, our popu-
lation was predominantly male. Fourth, because 
we did not use a single protocol for the admin-
istration of intravenous fluids, all the patients 
did not receive identical fluid volumes. However, 
the volumes of fluids that were administered were 
similar across groups. Furthermore, our approach 
closely approximated clinical practice, which en-
hances the generalizability of the results. Fifth, 
many of our patients underwent diagnostic angi-
ography with relatively small volumes of contrast 
material and without percutaneous interventions, 
which diminished the risk of contrast-associated 
acute kidney injury and may account for the low-
er-than-predicted event rates observed. Finally, by 
enrolling only patients who were undergoing 
angiography, our findings may not be generaliz-
able to other procedures that involve the intrave-
nous administration of iodinated contrast mate-
rial, although there is no biologic reason to believe 
the results would not apply in such circumstances.
In conclusion, in patients with impaired kid-
ney function who were undergoing angiography, 
we found that periprocedural intravenous isotonic 
sodium bicarbonate showed no benefit over intra-
venous isotonic sodium chloride with respect to 
the risk of major adverse kidney events, death, or 
acute kidney injury. In addition, we found no ben-
efit for the oral administration of acetylcysteine 
over placebo in decreasing the same risks.
