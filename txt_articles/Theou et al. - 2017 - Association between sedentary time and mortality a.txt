edentary behaviours are increasingly recognized as con-
ferring health risks, independent of physical activity. The 
health benefits of physical activity are well established, 
and meeting minimum guidelines for physical activity is associ-
ated with reduced risk of many chronic conditions, functional 
decline, development of psychologic disorders and mortality.1–9 
However, even among people who engage in periods of purpose-
ful exercise, sedentary behaviours can increase the risk of 
adverse outcomes, such as metabolic risk factors, functional lim-
itations, and all-cause and cardiovascular disease mortality.10–16 
Even so, a recent meta-analysis showed that engaging in moder-
ate physical activity, such as exercise, for at least 1 hour/day 
could eliminate the detrimental effects of prolonged sitting.17
Although most of the research on sedentary behaviours has 
focused on children and younger adults, middle-aged and older 
adults are the most sedentary group. A study using data from the 
Canadian Health Measures Survey showed that Canadians over the 
age of 40 are highly sedentary, spending about 9.5–10 of their wak-
ing hours in sedentary behaviours (age 40–59 yr, 9.5 h for men and 
9.8 h for women; age 60–79 yr, 9.9 h for men, 10 h for women).18 
Only 14.6% of the Canadian population aged 40–59 years and 
13.1% of those aged 60–79 years met the recommended 2.5 hours/
week of moderate-to-vigorous physical activity.18 Another study 
using data from the US National Health and Nutrition Examination 
Survey (NHANES) showed that participants over the age of 50 years 
spent on average 8.5 of their waking hours in sedentary behav-
iours.19 Only 7.1% of the population met the recommended 
2.5 hours/week of moderate-to-vigorous physical activity.19
Reducing sedentary behaviours could improve health out-
comes in middle-aged and older adults. Replacing 30 minutes of 
sedentary time with an equal amount of light activity or moder-
ate-to-vigorous activity was associated with 14% and 50% reduc-
tions in risk of mortality, respectively.20,21 Even so, studies have 
shown a strong relation between sedentary behaviours and 
frailty, independent of moderate-to-vigorous activity.22,23 In addi-
tion, levels of sedentary behaviours closely corresponded to

ABSTRACT
BACKGROUND: Sedentary behaviours 
are associated with adverse health out-
comes in middle-aged and older 
adults, even among those who exer-
cise. We examined whether the degree 
of frailty affects the association 
between sedentary behaviours and 
higher risk of mortality.
METHODS: In this prospective cohort 
study, we used data from 3141 com-
munity-dwelling adults 50 years of age 
or older from the 2003/04 and 2005/06 
cohorts of the US National Health and 
Nutrition Examination Survey. Time 
engaged in sedentary behaviours was 
measured using uniaxial accelerom-
eters, and frailty was based on a 46-item 
frailty index. Mortality data were linked 
up to 2011. We used Cox proportional 
hazard models to estimate the hazard 
ratio (HR) of sedentary behaviour.
RESULTS: We found that for people 
with low levels of frailty (frailty index 
score ≤ 0.1), sedentary time was not 
predictive of mortality, regardless of 
physical activity level (adjusted HR 0.90, 
95% confidence interval [CI] 0.70–1.15). 
Among people who were vulnerable 
(0.1 < frailty index score ≤ 0.2) or frail 
(frailty index score > 0.2), sedentary 
time was associated with higher mor-
tality only among those who were phys-
ically inactive (not meeting the criterion 
for moderate physical activity) (HR 1.16, 
95% CI 1.02–1.33 for the group defined 
by 0.1 < frailty index score ≤ 0.2; HR 
1.27, 95% CI 1.11–1.46 for the group 
defined by 0.2 < frailty index score ≤ 0.3; 
HR 1.34, 95% CI 1.19–1.50 for frailty 
index score > 0.3). 
INTERPRETATION: The effect of sed-
entary behaviours on mortality varied 
by level of frailty. Adults with the 
highest frailty level experienced the 
greatest adverse impact. Low frailty 
levels (frailty index score ≤ 0.1) 
seemed to eliminate the increased 
risk of mortality associated with pro-
longed sitting, even among people 
who did not meet recommended 
physical activity guidelines.

levels of frailty, with nonfrail individuals being sedentary for an 
average of 8.2 hours/day, whereas most frail individuals were 
sedentary for 9.6 hours/day.19 Yet no studies have examined 
whether the effect of sedentary behaviours on adverse health 
outcomes differs across levels of frailty. Such an understanding is 
vital if we are to systematically address sedentary behaviour 
among older people as a risk factor for adverse outcomes. We 
undertook this study to examine whether frailty level affects the 
association of sedentary behaviours with higher risk of mortality.
Methods
Sample
We used data from the 2003/04 and 2005/06 cohorts of the NHANES. 
The NHANES is a series of cross-sectional surveys of a community-
based sample. The NHANES investigators selected participants 
using a complex algorithm to ensure that the sample was nationally 
representative of the United States.24 For the current study, we 
included only participants 50 years of age or older who had a valid 
frailty index score, as well as accelerometer and mortality data. The 
NHANES investigators linked the NHANES data with death certifi-
cate data from the National Death Index to estimate mortality sta-
tus.25 We calculated person-years of follow-up from the examination 
date until the date of death or censoring on Dec. 31, 2011. 
Frailty index
Using the deficit accumulation approach, we used a 46-item frailty 
index that was constructed and validated in the NHANES popu-
lation.19,26 We have previously published a complete list of deficits 
and coding.27 We calculated individual frailty index scores by divid-
ing the number of deficits present in an individual by the total num-
ber of deficits considered; for example, an individual with 23 out of 
a possible 46 deficits would have a score of 0.5 (23/46). As noted 
above, we excluded from the analysis individuals with missing 
frailty data, defined as those with data missing on more than 20% 
of deficits. We categorized frailty index scores into 0.1-point incre-
ments to create 4 groups (≤ 0.1, 0.1 < frailty index score ≤ 0.2, 0.2 < 
frailty index score ≤ 0.3, and > 0.3). These cut points are widely used 
in the literature.28,29 In our previous study using NHANES data,19 the 
first 2 categories were very similar but the third category was 0.2–
0.45 and the fourth category was greater than 0.45. Although this 
categorization isolated people with severe frailty into 1 category 
(> 0.45), the group was very small (n = 122), with only 3 people 
meeting the guidelines of 2.5 hours/week of moderate-to-vigorous 
physical activity and only 2 reporting vigorous activity.19 Therefore, 
for the current study, we used 0.3 as the cut point for the fourth 
group, which identified people with moderate-to-severe frailty.
Physical activity and measures of sedentary behaviour
Each participant wore a uniaxial AM-7164 accelerometer (Acti-
Graph, LLC) on an elastic waist belt for a 7-day period. NHANES 
investigators instructed participants to wear the accelerometer 
during all waking hours and to remove it during bathing or swim-
ming activities. We excluded all data marked as nonreliable or not 
in calibration; only the data of those who wore the accelerometer 
for a minimum of 10 hours on 4 separate days were included in the 
analysis.18,30 Using validated NHANES cut points,19,30 we defined 
sedentary behaviour as 0–100 counts/minute and moderate-to-
vigorous physical activity as greater than 2020 counts/minute. We 
analyzed sedentary behaviour as both a continuous and a categor-
ical variable, where low sedentary behaviour was less than 7 hours/
day, intermediate sedentary behaviour was 7 to 10 hours/day, and 
high sedentary behaviour was more than 10 hours/day. We also 
dichotomized physical activity as meeting or not meeting the rec-
ommendations of both the Canadian Society for Exercise Physiol-
ogy4 and the American College of Sports Medicine31,32 (2.5 h/wk of 
moderate-to-vigorous physical activity). Participants self-reported 
vigorous activity by stating whether they had done any activity that 
caused heavy sweating or large increases in breathing or heart rate 
for a period of at least 10 minutes over the past 30 days. 
Statistical analysis
We conducted all statistical analyses using SPSS software, version 21 
(IBM). We calculated mortality rates for all participants after stratify-
ing by frailty index level, by sedentary time and by accelerometer-
measured and self-reported physical activity. We used the Pearson χ2 
test to examine associations between mortality and frailty group, sed-
entary time and physical activity. We used Cox proportional hazard 
models to estimate the hazard ratio of sedentary behaviour. To con-
trol for the fact that participants entered the study at different ages, 
we used residual proportional hazards regression.33 In the first stage, 
time-varying covariables (i.e., frailty, moderate-to-vigorous physical 
activity and self-reported exercise) were individually regressed on age, 
and the residuals from each of these regressions were saved. In the 
second stage, we ran Cox regressions with age and the saved resid-
uals replacing their corresponding covariables. Because we were 
interested in adults 50 years of age or older, we used age as the time 
scale, with age 50 years as the time origin. The basic model examined 
the risk of death associated with sedentary behaviour controlling for 
significant covariables; additional models adjusted for both objec-
tively and subjectively measured physical activity. We then stratified 
the analyses by objectively measured physical activity (≥ 2.5 h/wk or 
< 2.5 h/wk of moderate-to-vigorous physical activity) and self-
reported vigorous physical activity in the last 30 days (yes or no) and 
then further stratified by frailty index level. We stratified Kaplan–Meier 
survival curves, using time from assessment as the time scale, by both 
frailty index group and physical activity. We used statistical weights 
for demographic characteristics and mortality rates to ensure that the 
sample was representative of the US population.
We included in the regression models the following covari-
ables, which have been shown to be related to sedentary time 
and frailty: age (yr), sex (male, female), education (less than high 
school, high school, some college or associate degree, college 
graduate or more), race/ethnicity (Mexican American or other 
Hispanic, non-Hispanic white, non-Hispanic black, other), marital 
status (married, widowed, divorced or separated, never married), 
smoking status (never, past, current), body mass index (< 18.5, 
18.5–24.9, 25–29.9, ≥ 30), employment status (working full-time, 
not working full-time), accelerometer wear time (h) and study 
cohort (2003/04, 2005/06). We considered annual household 
income and alcohol use as potential covariables but did not 
include them because of missing data.

Results
Of the 20 470 participants from the 2003/04 and 2005/06 NHANES 
cohorts, 4874 individuals were aged 50 years or older. After exclu-
sion of participants with missing accelerometer data (n = 1421), 
frailty index data (n = 307) and mortality data (n = 5), the final sam-
ple size was 3141 (Appendix 1, available at www.cmaj.ca/lookup/
suppl/doi:10.1503/cmaj.161034/-/DC1). Those excluded were 
slightly older than those included in the analysis (mean age ± stan-
dard deviation 65.9 ± 12.0 v. 63.3 ± 10.1 yr), with slightly higher 
levels of disability based on activities of daily living (for women, 
54.3% of those excluded v. 53.7% of those included had disability; 
for men, 19.8% of those excluded v. 17.0% of those included had 
disability). On average, accelerometer data were available for 6.24 
± 0.94 days and 14.2 ± 1.7 daily hours for each participant. The 
mean duration of follow-up from the date of baseline assessment 
until the date of death or censoring was 6.5 ± 1.6 years.

12.0% (550/3141) or 18.7 deaths per 1000 person-years (Table 2). 
Mortality rate increased with higher frailty index levels, both in 
the overall sample (p < 0.001) and when stratified by sedentary 
time or physical activity (p < 0.001). 
Cox regression models showed significant interaction 
between frailty and sedentary behaviour, even when objectively 
measured and self-reported physical activity were added to the 
model (Table 3). When the analysis was stratified by physical 
activity, we found that for those who met the moderate-to-vigor-
ous physical activity requirements and for those who reported 
vigorous physical activity, there was no significant interaction 
between frailty and sedentary behaviour, and sedentary time 
was not associated with mortality (Table 3). When the analysis 
was stratified by frailty level, we found that sedentary behaviour 
remained associated with mortality in the 3 highest frailty index 
groups in a fully adjusted model (frailty index score > 0.1) but not 
in the group with low frailty (frailty index score ≤ 0.1) (Table 4). 
There was no association between sedentary behaviour and 
mortality among those who met the requirements for moderate-
to-vigorous physical activity or self-reported vigorous physical 
activity in the last month (Table 4).
Kaplan–Meier curves showed a significant separation among 
low, intermediate and high levels of sedentary behaviour. This 
pattern held true for the 3 highest frailty index groups of the 
overall sample (p < 0.05) and for those who were physically inac-
tive by objective measurement (p < 0.05; Figure 1) or did not 
report vigorous physical activity in the past month (p < 0.05).
Interpretation
This large, nationally representative study of the US population 
showed the degree to which the accumulation of age-related 
health deficits affects the association between sedentary 
behaviours and higher risk of mortality. We found that for peo-
ple who had low levels of frailty (frailty index score ≤ 0.1), sed-
entary time was not predictive of mortality, regardless of phys-
ical activity level. For those who were vulnerable (0.1 < frailty 
index score ≤ 0.2) or frail (frailty index score > 0.2), sedentary 
time was associated with higher mortality only among those 
who were physically inactive (not meeting the requirement for 
moderate physical activity or not reporting participation in vig-
orous activity). Thus, among people who are inactive and vul-
nerable or frail, sitting time increases mortality risk, but among 
those who are nonfrail or active, sitting time does not affect the 
risk of mortality. 
NHANES is a cross-sectional survey, and mortality data were 
provided through linkage to death certificate data. Although this 
approach increases the accuracy of the data, it did not allow us 
to examine whether changes in sitting time affect the risk of 
death. NHANES collected accelerometer data only from the

2003/04 and 2005/06 cohorts; therefore, more recent data for 
objectively measured physical activity levels were not available 
to us through this survey. We expect that if we had been able to 
use more recent data in our study, we could have shown a 
slightly higher level of physical activity among participants; how-
ever, we do not expect that the relation between sedentary 
behaviours and mortality would have been different. A previous 
study using the NHANES self-reported physical activity data 
showed that more participants in the 2011/12 cycle than the 
2007/08 cycle met the physical activity guidelines (21.7% v. 
27.2%); however, the proportion of people reporting no leisure 
time physical activity remained stable between the 2 cohorts.34 
Multiple studies have shown that sedentary behaviours are 
associated with mortality in middle-aged and older adults.20,21,35,36 
Wijndaele and colleagues35 showed that time spent watching tele-
vision was associated with all-cause mortality in a population-
based cohort (the European Prospective Investigation into Cancer 
and Nutrition study) of about 13 000 people (62 ± 9 yr), even after 
stratification by age, sex, education, body mass index and energy 
expenditure for total physical activity. Similarly, Matthews and 
colleagues36 showed that time spent watching television was 
associated with all-cause mortality in 240 819 adults (50–71 yr) 
from the Diet and Health Study of the National Institutes of Health 
and the American Association of Retired Persons, even after strati-
fication by age, sex, education, race, body mass index, smoking, 
chronic conditions and diet quality. Fishman and colleagues21 
showed that replacing objectively measured sedentary time with 
light activity was associated with a reduction in mortality risk in 
NHANES, and the sex-stratified findings were similar to the find-
ings for men and women combined. The current study showed 
that stratification by frailty level had an impact on the effect of 
sedentary behaviours on mortality. Differences from these previ-
ous studies may be related to levels of frailty representing the 
overall health state of an individual and the frailty index being a 
more sensitive measure for change in health than other mea-
sures. Similar to our study, a recent meta-analysis including data 
from more than 1 million individuals showed that among people 
who were physically active (> 35.5 metabolic equivalent of task-
hours per week or about 60–75 min/d), sedentary time was not 
predictive of all-cause mortality.17

Limitations
Our study had some limitations, and our findings should be inter-
preted with caution. As is typical for studies using physical activ-
ity monitors, almost one-third of participants in our study were 
missing accelerometer data, and these participants seemed to 
have higher levels of frailty. Thus, our sample size was substan-
tially reduced, especially among the group with the highest level 
of frailty, which made it necessary to merge frailty groups for 
some analyses and prevented us from isolating those with severe 
frailty (frailty index score > 0.45) into 1 category. Future studies 
will need to examine the effect of sedentary behaviours on peo-
ple with higher levels of frailty using other data sets. Further-
more, we could not include income and alcohol as covariables 
because of missing data. Another limitation relates to the accel-
erometer cut points used in this study to assess the time spent in 
sedentary behaviours and moderate-to-vigorous physical activ-
ity; although widely used, these cut points are based on studies 
involving healthier older adults and we may therefore have over-
estimated sedentary time in the participants with higher frailty 
levels. Even so, accelerometers are reliable measures of seden-
tary behaviours, have been validated in older adults with and 
without impaired function37–42 and can also be used for people 
with cognitive problems who cannot complete questionnaires 
about their daily levels of physical activity.43,44 Finally, although 
the HRs per hour of sedentary behaviour were relatively high for 
most models, the lower limit of some confidence intervals was 
close to 1.00.
Conclusion
This study has shown that the effect of sedentary behaviours on 
mortality differs across levels of frailty among people who are 
physically inactive, with people who are most frail experiencing

the greatest impact. For these individuals, it appears that all 
hours of the day have an effect on health, not just those spent in 
physical activity of moderate-to-vigorous intensity. Similar to the 
situation for tobacco control, where doctors do not emphasize 
the benefits of nonsmoking, but rather the harms of smoking, we 
should also emphasize the harms of sedentary behaviours rather 
than just the benefits of physical activity.5 This is an important 
public health message that should be part of a larger promotion 
of the importance of healthy lifestyle behaviours.45 The first 
Canadian 24-hour movement guideline for children and youth, 
released in June 2016, suggested that sitting for extended peri-
ods should be limited and that recreational screen time should 
not exceed 2 hours a day. Similar guidelines are needed for mid-
dle-aged and older adults.46 Future studies should also examine 
whether the degree of frailty affects the association of sedentary 
behaviours with other adverse outcomes, such as functional and 
cognitive decline, and whether interventions to reduce sitting 
time should be modified on the basis of frailty level of partici-
pants. A randomized clinical trial should examine whether reduc-
ing sedentary behaviours can prevent or delay frailty.
