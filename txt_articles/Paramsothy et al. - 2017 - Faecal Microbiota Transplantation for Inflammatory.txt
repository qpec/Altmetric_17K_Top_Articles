Abstract
Background: Faecal microbiota transplantation [FMT] has been investigated as a potential 
treatment for inflammatory bowel disease [IBD]. We thus performed a systematic review and 
meta-analysis assessing the effectiveness and safety of FMT in IBD.
Methods: A systematic review was conducted until January 2017. Studies were excluded if patients 
had co-infection or data were pooled across disease subtypes (ulcerative colitis [UC], Crohn’s 
disease [CD], pouchitis). Clinical remission was established as the primary outcome. Pooled effect 
sizes and 95% confidence intervals were obtained using the random effects model.
Results: In all, 53 studies were included [41 in UC, 11 in CD, 4 in pouchitis]. Overall, 36% [201/555] of 
UC, 50.5% [42/83] of CD, and 21.5% [5/23] of pouchitis patients achieved clinical remission. Among 
cohort studies, the pooled proportion achieving clinical remission was 33% (95% confidence 
interval [CI] = 23%–43%] for UC and 52% [95% CI = 31%–72%] for CD, both with moderate risk of 
heterogeneity. For four RCTs in UC, significant benefit in clinical remission (pooled odds ratios 
[[P-OR] = 2.89, 95% CI = 1.36–6.13, p = 0.006) with moderate heterogeneity [Cochran’s Q, p = 0.188; 
I2 = 37%] was noted. Sub-analyses suggest remission in UC improved with increased number of 
FMT infusions and lower gastrointestinal tract administration. Most adverse events were transient 
gastrointestinal complaints. Microbiota analysis was performed in 24 studies, with many identifying 
increased diversity and a shift in recipient microbiota profile towards the donor post-FMT
.
Conclusions: FMT appears effective in UC remission induction, but long-term durability and safety 
remain unclear. Additional well-designed controlled studies of FMT in IBD are needed, especially 
in CD and pouchitis.

 FMT in IBD Meta-analysis 
1181
1. Introduction
Faecal microbiota transplantation [FMT] has revolutionised the field 
of microbial therapeutics. It has proven extremely effective in the 
treatment of Clostridium difficile infection [CDI],1,2 and is consid-
ered to have potential in other conditions where disturbances in the 
enteric microbiota are implicated in disease pathogenesis, such as 
the inflammatory bowel diseases [IBD].3 Although FMT is a sim-
ple therapy in practice that was first described in Western medical 
literature over 50 years ago,4 and proposed as a treatment strategy 
for IBD over 25 years ago,5 it is only in recent years that there has 
been an exponential growth in patient, media, and research interest.6 
The initial systematic review on the role of FMT in IBD published in 
2012 consisted of only nine retrospective reports, deemed of insuf-
ficient quality to perform meta-analysis.7 Within 2 years, an updated 
systematic review identified 18 studies, including nine cohort stud-
ies of FMT in IBD on which a meta-analysis was performed.8 Since 
then, the number of available studies has again more than doubled, 
including the publication of the first four randomised controlled tri-
als [RCTs] of FMT in ulcerative colitis [UC].9–12
In this latest systematic review and meta-analysis, we sum-
marise the available literature and evaluate the efficacy of FMT 
in the various IBD subtypes of UC, Crohn’s disease [CD], and 
pouchitis, by performing meta-analyses on the associated pro-
spective studies.
2. Methods
2.1. Search strategy
A systematic review was conducted in accordance with the 
PRISMA,13 Cochrane,14 and MOOSE15 guidelines. We searched five 
electronic databases [Pubmed, Medline, Cochrane, Biomed Central, 
and Embase] from inception to the January 4, 2017 using search 
terms as previously described7 [Table A1, available as Supplementary 
data at ECCO-JCC online]. No language limits or any other advance 
features were used. Major conference proceedings from 2011–2016 
were searched to identify abstract publications, including: Digestive 
Diseases Week [DDW], European Crohn’s and Colitis Organisation 
[ECCO; including 2017], United European Gastroenterology 
Week [UEGW], American College of Gastroenterology [ACG], and 
Advances in IBD [AIBD]. References from previous review articles 
were also searched to identify studies that may have been missed 
by the above-mentioned searches. The clinicaltrials.gov registry was 
also searched.
2.2. Study selection criteria
2.2.1. Inclusion criteria
Articles were included in this systematic review if they reported on 
clinical efficacy and/or safety of FMT in inflammatory bowel dis-
ease in human subjects. FMT was defined as the infusion of fae-
ces-derived matter and bacteria from a healthy individual[s] into a 
recipient. Case reports, case series, cohort studies, and RCTs were all 
included [full text or abstract publications]. For the meta-analyses, 
however, only cohort studies and RCTs were included.
2.2.2. Exclusion criteria
Studies were excluded if data for particular IBD subtypes [UC, CD, 
pouchitis] were pooled and not individually reported, due to inher-
ent differences between these conditions. Studies were also excluded 
if they only included patients who had co-infection with Clostridium 
difficile or other pathogens, or if data on non-infected IBD patients 
were not individually reported or able to be extracted. In addition, 
studies reporting duplicate data were excluded.
2.2.3. Outcome measures
Efficacy of FMT in IBD was assessed as clinical remission [primary 
outcome] or clinical response as defined by the respective study 
authors [Tables 1–5]. Where possible, endoscopic [mucosal healing] 
and histologic data were also extracted. Safety was assessed using 
reported adverse event and serious adverse event data.
2.3. Data extraction
References were imported into a bibliographic database [Microsoft 
Excel 2015]. Two authors [SP, RP] independently reviewed all arti-
cles, initially by title and abstract, then by full text review where rel-
evant, to determine eligibility. Duplicate studies/data were removed 
manually; when multiple publications related to the same patient 
group, the most complete data set was included. Eligible studies 
were categorised based on FMT indication. Data related to the study 
design and characteristics, treatment groups, and outcome measures 
were recorded. Where there was disagreement on study eligibility 
or data extraction, consensus was achieved through discussion [SP, 
RP, NCR].
2.4. Study quality assessment
For eligible cohort studies, the methodological quality was assessed 
using the Newcastle-Ottawa Scale [NOS]16 on the standard 9-point 
scale. Included RCTs were assessed using the Cochrane risk of bias 
score17 incorporating random sequence generation, allocation con-
cealment, blinding, incomplete outcome data, and selective reporting.
2.5. Statistical analysis
Descriptive statistics were performed on data extracted from all 
included studies. The efficacy of treatment [clinical remission and/or 
response] was compared across studies per IBD subtype. For disease 
subtypes where three or more cohort or RCT studies were included, 
a meta-analysis was performed. The pooled effect sizes, as well as 
95% confidence intervals [CIs], were calculated using both fixed 
and random effects models. However, the random effects model was 
the preferred option as it assumes that there is a distribution of true 
effect sizes rather than one true effect, and it assigns a more balanced 
weight to each study. For meta-analyses including cohort studies, the 
effect size refers to the pooled estimate proportion of patients that 
achieved efficacy. For meta-analyses including RCTs, pooled odd 
ratios [P-ORs] were calculated by weighting individual ORs by the 
inverse of their variance. p-values < 0.05 were considered significant. 
Heterogeneity was assessed using Cochran´s Q test [p-value < 0.10 is 
indicative of heterogeneity] and Higgins´ test [I2] [low heterogeneity: 
< 25%, moderate heterogeneity: 25–75%, and high heterogeneity: > 
75%].18 Moderator variables including disease severity [mild vs mod-
erate vs severe], route of administration [upper vs lower gastrointesti-
nal FMT infusion], number of infusions (low [1 infusion] vs medium 
[2–4 infusions] vs high [5–10] vs very high [> 10]), population [paedi-
atric vs adult], preparation of inoculum [fresh vs frozen], FMT donor 
source [related vs unrelated donor], antibiotic pre-treatment, and 
bowel lavage, were used to perform subgroup analyses. Sensitivity 
[leave-one-out] analyses were also conducted to assess statistical 
robustness. Publication bias was assessed using the Egger’s regres-
sion asymmetry test as well as funnel plots. Statistical analyses were 
performed using the Comprehensive Meta-Analysis software V. 3.0 
[Biostat, Englewood, NJ, 2004].

3. Results
3.1. Study characteristics
A total of 6806 articles were identified in the search, which included 261 
internal and external duplicates [Figure 1]. Titles and abstracts of 6545 
articles were screened and only 109 were deemed potentially eligible, of 
which 107 were available for review. A total of 53 articles or abstracts 
of FMT in IBD were deemed to satisfy the study selection criteria and 
were included in the final analysis, of which three included more than 
one IBD subtype. This included 41 articles or abstracts assessing FMT 
in UC and reporting on 555 UC patients, 11 in CD reporting on 83 CD 
patients, and four in pouchitis reporting on 23 patients.
3.2. Study quality
The methodological quality of the included cohort studies and 
RCTs are outlined in the Appendix [Tables A2, A3, available as 
Supplementary data at ECCO-JCC online]. Only four cohort studies 
included a control group, with a mean NOS score of 5 [range 3 to 
9] out of 9. The risk of bias in the included randomized trials was 
low [Costello et al., 2017,12 presented in abstract form but yet to 
undergo full publication peer review]. All significant results obtained 
through the meta-analyses remained significant in sensitivity analy-
ses, inferring statistical robustness.
3.3. Ulcerative colitis
A total of 41 studies were identified assessing FMT in UC (nine 
case reports, five case series, 24 prospective cohort studies 
 
[20 uncontrolled, four controlled] and four RCTs), reporting on 555 
UC patients [Tables 1-3].
Overall, 36% [201/555] of UC patients achieved clinical remis-
sion during follow-up. Among the 24 cohort studies included in 
the meta-analysis [Figure 2], which comprised 307 individuals, the 
pooled proportion of patients that achieved clinical remission was 
33% [95% CI = 23–43%] for UC, with a moderate risk of hetero-
geneity [Cochran’s Q, p = 0.001; I2 = 54%] [Table A4, available as 
Supplementary data at ECCO-JCC online] and no publication bias 
[Table A5, available as Supplementary data at ECCO-JCC online]. 
The pooled proportion of patients that achieved clinical response 
was 52% [95% CI = 40–64%] in a meta-analysis that included 
234 individuals from 20 cohort studies [Figure A1, available as 
Supplementary data at ECCO-JCC online]; a moderate level of het-
erogeneity [Cochran’s Q, p = 0.001; I2 = 58%] and no publication 
bias was observed in this meta-analysis [Table A5].
Meta-analysis including four RCTs of FMT in UC [Figure 3], 
which comprised a total of 140 FMT-treated individuals, showed 
that FMT was significantly associated with clinical remission 
in these patients [P-OR = 2.89, 95% CI = 1.36–6.13, p = 0.006]. 
Heterogeneity was moderate in this meta-analysis [Cochran’s Q, 
p = 0.188; I2 = 37%] with no publication bias [Table A5]. A signifi-
cant association was also found between FMT and clinical response 
in UC patients [P-OR = 2.48, 95% CI = 1.18-5.21, p = 0.016] [Figure 
A2, available as Supplementary data at ECCO-JCC online], with a 
moderate level of heterogeneity [Cochran’s Q, p = 0.102; I2 = 52%] 
and no publication bias [Table A5].
Interestingly, sensitivity analyses showed that on removal of the 
RCT by Rossen et al.10 [which in contrast to the other studies used only 
two infusions and administered them via an upper gastrointestinal 
infusion] the association between FMT and clinical remission in UC 
patients was highly significant [P-OR of 4.05, 95% CI = 2.08–7.89, 
p = < 0.001; Cochran’s Q, p = 0.783; I2 = 0%] [Figure A3, available as

between FMT and clinical response in these patients when the RCT 
by Rossen et al.10 was removed showed a higher P-OR of 3.39 [95% 
CI = 1.90–6.04, p = < 0.001; Cochran’s Q, p = 0.442; I2 = 0%] [Figure 
A4, available as Supplementary data at ECCO-JCC online].
3.4. Crohn’s disease
Eleven studies in CD [four case reports, seven prospective uncon-
trolled cohort studies] reporting on 83 CD patients were included 
[Table 4]. Overall 50.5% [42/83] of CD patients achieved clinical 
remission during follow-up. Among the six cohort studies included in 
the meta-analysis [Figure 4], comprising 71 individuals, the pooled pro-
portion of CD patients that achieved clinical remission was 52% [95% 
CI = 31–72%] with a moderate risk of heterogeneity [Cochran’s Q, 
p = 0.063; I2 = 52%]; however, publications bias was observed in this 
meta-analysis [Table A5]. A meta-analysis including four cohort stud-
ies [Figure A5, available as Supplementary data at ECCO-JCC online], 
which comprised 59 individuals, showed that the pooled estimate 
proportion of patients that achieved clinical response was 63% [95% 
CI = 30–88%]. Moderate heterogeneity was observed in this meta-anal-
ysis [Cochran’s Q, p = 0.016, I2 = 71%]; no publication bias was detected 
[Table A5].
3.5. Pouchitis
Three prospective uncontrolled cohort studies and one case report 
assessing FMT in pouchitis were identified [Table 5], reporting on 
23 patients. Two of the cohort studies used a single FMT infusion; 
no patients achieved clinical remission, with 2/8 [25%] achieving 
clinical response in one study63 and, in the other study, 5/7 [71%] 
had global symptom improvement [not defined] at 1 month.64 In 
the only study that allowed for multiple FMT infusions, 4/5 patients 
achieved clinical remission [with the other patient achieving clinical 
response].65 We did not perform a pouchitis meta-analysis as only 
three small cohort studies were identified which had differing end-
points and conflicting outcomes.
3.6. Endoscopic data
Specific endoscopic outcomes were reported in the four RCTs and 
six of the 24 cohort studies of FMT in UC [Table 2]. Accounting 
for differing definitions of endoscopic outcomes, endoscopic remis-
sion or endoscopic response rates of 24–55% with allogeneic FMT 
vs 5–17% with control [placebo or autologous FMT] [mean differ-
ence 26.3% ± 9.9, p-value: 0.057] were noted in the RCTs involv-
ing multiple lower gastrointestinal FMT infusions,9,11,12 whereas no 
difference was noted in endoscopic response between allogenic or 
autologous FMT administered by two nasoduodenal infusions [35% 
vs 36%]10 [Table 3]. Only one study in CD reported endoscopic out-
comes,42 with none of six patients achieving endoscopic remission. In 
the one pouchitis study that reported endoscopic outcomes, all five 
patients had an endoscopic response and one patient [20%] achieved 
endoscopic remission after 1–7 FMT infusions.65

Only a small number of studies in UC reported histologic out-
comes. Post hoc analysis of one RCT identified that 7/38 patients

remission.9 Only two of the 24 identified cohort studies of FMT in 
UC reported histologic data.36,38 Only one case report of FMT in 
CD provided histologic outcomes.57 In the one pouchitis study that 
reported histologic outcomes, none of five patients achieved a PDAI 
histologic subscore of 0.65
3.8. Paediatric vs adult populations
Subgroup analyses were performed for a number of variables 
thought to be of importance [Table A6, available as Supplementary 
data at ECCO-JCC online], including population age [paediatric 
vs adult]. There were six cohort studies assessing 34 patients in 
paediatric UC and only two cohort studies assessing 13 patients 
in paediatric CD. The pooled estimate proportion of patients 
that achieved clinical remission was 23% [95% CI = 7–51%; 
Cochran’s Q, p = 0.171; I2 = 35%] for paediatric UC and 34% 
[95% CI = 24–46%; Cochran’s Q, p = 0.001; I2 = 58%] for adult 
UC. For CD, the pooled estimate of clinical remission was 54% 
[95% CI = 28–78%; Cochran’s Q, p = 0.853; I2 = 0%] in pae-
diatric CD patients and 46% [95% CI = 18–77%; Cochran’s Q, 
p = 0.017; I2 = 71%] in adult CD patients. No completed ran-
domised controlled trials have been published assessing FMT in 
paediatric IBD.
3.9. FMT methodology
The included studies varied substantially in FMT infusion meth-
odology/protocol, including route of administration, number and 
frequency of infusions, dosage of stool per infusion, preparation of 
inoculum [fresh or frozen], antibiotic pre-treatment, bowel lavage, 
and FMT donor source [related or unrelated].

S. Paramsothy et al.
Subgroup analyses of the cohort studies [Table A6] showed 
that route of administration might play a significant role in clini-
cal remission among UC patients, as the pooled proportion of UC 
patients receiving upper gastrointestinal infusions was 17% [95% 
CI = 8–32%; Cochran’s Q, p = 0.604; I2 = 0%] whereas the pooled 
proportion of UC patients receiving lower gastrointestinal infusions 
was 36% [95% CI = 24–50%; Cochran’s Q, p = 0.004; I2 = 57%]. 
Further subgroup analyses by number of infusions showed that the 
pooled proportion of UC patients receiving a high number of infu-
sions [> 10 infusions] that achieved clinical remission was 49% 
[95% CI = 21–77%; Cochran’s Q, p = 0.246; I2 = 29%], which was 
considerably higher than in those UC patients who received ≤ 10 
infusions [pooled proportion = 27%, 95% CI = 17–40%; Cochran’s 
Q, p = 0.001; I2 = 58%]. Although the pooled proportion of UC 
patients receiving fresh infusions that achieved clinical remission 
[28%, 95% CI = 15–46%; Cochran’s Q, p = 0.001; I2 = 63%] was 
less than with frozen infusions [36%, 95% CI = 13–67%; Cochran’s 
Q, p = 0.045; I2 = 63%], this was likely confounded by associa-
tion with an increased number of infusions. Further, the pooled 
proportion of UC patients who received an antibiotic course before 
FMT and achieved clinical remission was 33% [95% CI = 17–54%; 
Cochran’s Q, p = 0.026; I2 = 58%], whereas the proportion in UC 
patients who did not receive an antibiotic course pre-FMT was 28% 
[95% CI = 16–44%; Cochran’s Q, p = 0.002; I2 = 61%]. The rel-
evance of the other subgroup analyses findings is uncertain, given 
the small number of studies and patients. Only a few studies used a 
multi-donor infusion,11,12,50 but all reported some degree of clinical 
and endoscopic benefit [clinical remission rates 15–50%, endoscopic 
remission or response rates 10–55%] despite varying number of 
infusions [Tables 2, 3].
3.10. Safety
The majority of studies did not report major adverse events or 
serious adverse events that were deemed clinically related to FMT 
therapy. Most reported adverse events were transient minor gas-
trointestinal complaints [bloating, diarrhoea, flatulence, abdominal 
pain/cramping, borborygmus] and/or fever.31-35,44,46–48,52,54,58–61,63 The 
lack of a control arm in most of the studies makes it difficult to 
determine to what degree symptoms are specifically attributable 
to FMT. Nasogastric FMT infusion was associated with aspiration 
pneumonia in one study,42 prompting a switch to lower gastrointes-
tinal [GI] administration. A few reports of disease worsening40,49,55 
were identified, including one of cytomegalovirus [CMV] colitis in a 
patient who self-administered unscreened FMT.21 One death due to 
toxic megacolon and sepsis was reported.53
The RCTs found no difference between FMT and control arms 
in terms of minor or serious adverse events or disease worsening 
[Table 6], though it must be noted that these studies were not pow-
ered to specifically assess for safety.
3.11. Microbiological analyses
Microbiota analysis was performed in 17/41 UC, 4/11 CD, and 
3/4 pouchitis studies [Table A7, available as Supplementary data 
at ECCO-JCC online]. Most studies assessed luminal [faecal] 
samples with only a limited number analysing mucosal [biopsy] 
samples.33,63,66,67 A range of studies commented on recipient 
microbiota changes after FMT, with increased α-diversity or rich-
ness9,11,38,42,48,50,61,66 and a shift towards the donor profile, which 
in some cases was associated with colonisation by donor-derived 
taxa, though this was reported in patients both with clinical ben-
efit10,26,32,35,57,60,65 and without improvement.33,36 Some studies did 
report that the increase in recipient microbial diversity after FMT 
was greater in responders relative to non-responders.11,42,61,66 In par-
ticular, the study by Paramsothy et al.11, 66 found that recipient micro-
bial diversity at baseline predicted response to FMT, that microbial 
diversity increased with FMT, and that this persisted for 8 weeks 
following FMT. In this study, the multi-donor FMT batches used 
for the FMT infusions had substantially greater microbial diversity 
relative to the individual donors. A correlation between increased 
donor microbial diversity and therapeutic success of FMT in UC has 
been identified in some studies42,68 but not others.51 In the RCT by 
Moayeddi et al.,9 there was a trend towards a difference in recipient 
outcomes based on particular donor, with improved outcomes noted 
in patients receiving infusions derived from donor B [p = 0.06]. 
A variety of taxa were reported to be associated with both FMT in 
IBD in general, and more specifically with therapeutic outcomes in 
IBD patients, across the identified studies.
4. Discussion
This paper represents an up-to-date systematic review and meta-
analysis of FMT in IBD, incorporating both full text and abstract 
studies. There are almost three times as many studies included in 
this paper compared with previous systematic reviews and/or meta-
analyses on the topic,7,8,69,70 illustrating the rapid growth in global 
research interest and activity with regards to FMT for IBD, includ-
ing the first randomised trials of FMT in IBD.9–12 However, the 
overall quality of the studies remains low, primarily consisting of 
either case reports/series or small cohort studies of limited dura-
tion. Additionally, there remains considerable heterogeneity among 
the studies in terms of design, with conflicting treatment protocols 
[route of administration, number and frequency of infusions, anti-
biotic pre-treatment, bowel lavage] along with differing and often 
highly variable and/or poorly defined efficacy endpoints.
FMT in UC appears very promising, especially with multiple 
infusions administered via the lower gastrointestinal tract. An ear-
lier meta-analysis,8 assessing only UC cohort studies, identified 79 
patients with a pooled proportion achieving clinical remission of 
22% [95% CI = 10.4%–40.8%]. The current meta-analysis identi-
fied 24 UC cohort studies assessing 307 patients, with a pooled pro-
portion of patients that achieved clinical remission of 33% [95% CI 
= 23–43%]. Furthermore, four RCTs reporting on 140 FMT-treated 
UC patients were analysed. Meta-analysis of all four studies pro-
duced a significant association [P-OR = 2.89, 95% CI = 1.36–6.13, p

= 0.006] between FMT and UC clinical remission induction [Figure 
3]. Further sensitivity analyses showed that removal of the smallest 
study10 [which used only two infusions and administered them via 
an upper gastrointestinal infusion, as opposed to the other studies] 
resulted in an even more highly significant association between FMT 
and clinical remission in UC patients [P-OR of 4.05, 95% CI = 2.08–
7.89, p = < 0.001] [Figure A3]. This, along with subgroup analyses 
of the UC cohort studies, suggests that multiple infusions [and pos-
sibly lower gastrointestinal administration] increases the likelihood 
of remission in UC patients treated with FMT, though the precise 
number required varied substantially between studies, remains to be 
defined, and likely is donor-and recipient-dependent.
Regarding the role of FMT in CD, the pooled proportion of 
patients that achieved clinical remission presented in the current 
meta-analysis [52%] is slightly lower than the figure reported in 
the previous meta-analysis8 [pooled proportion = 60.5%, 95% 
CI = 28.4%–85.6%]. As previously highlighted by these authors, 
however, the CD results should be interpreted with caution, as the 
confidence intervals remain wide and the pooled effect size may be 
inflated due to the variability of methodology among individual 
studies and the still limited data. This is further supported by the 
publications bias observed in the current meta-analysis on clinical 
remission and FMT in CD patients. Furthermore, it is known that 
clinical remission does not correlate with endoscopic outcomes in 
CD. Of note, in the only CD cohort study to report endoscopic out-
comes, no patient experienced endoscopic remission.42
There remain major limitations in the available literature of this 
developing field. There are insufficient data to support FMT for 
other indications besides CDI,71,72 with no randomised trials pub-
lished or presented to date outside UC. Even within UC, the existing 
studies are relatively small in size [largest 81 patients], and where 
FMT would be best placed in the therapeutic algorithm is unclear 
given the growing number of biologics73 and emerging targeted small 
molecule therapies.74,75 Long-term follow-up data regarding FMT 
efficacy/durability and safety in IBD are lacking. The available data 
suggest that disease relapse will invariably occur [though the durabil-
ity and impact of number of infusions are poorly defined] and some 
form of maintenance therapy is required. However, almost all studies 
performed to date have assessed the role of FMT in remission induc-
tion for IBD, with a paucity of literature on the potential of FMT as a 
maintenance therapy38 once remission is established. The safety data 
from the available literature are reassuring though limited by study 
size and follow-up period. There have been reports from the FMT 
in IBD and CDI co-infection literature, of disease flare following 
FMT.76,77 However, these must be considered in the context of an 
absence of a control arm [to account for gastrointestinal symptoms 
after FMT in non-IBD patients], difficulty in distinguishing colitis 
symptoms attributable to IBD as opposed to CDI, along with vari-
able endoscopic mucosal activity assessment. In this context, Fischer 
et al.77 reported improvement in clinician assessment of IBD activity 
after FMT for CDI in 31/67 [46%] and worsening in 12/67 [18%]. 
Additionally, there are few well-conducted microbiological studies 
on the effect of FMT on the intestinal microbiota in IBD. These are 
clearly required if we are to better understand the underlying mecha-
nism of action and microbial predictors of therapeutic outcome, both 
beneficial and detrimental. Most studies to date have included small 
numbers of patients and focused primarily on microbial composi-
tion and not functional/metabolic consequences. Taxanomic changes 
identified to date associated with FMT and therapeutic benefit, are 
variable and inconsistent [Table A7]. There exist inherent differences 
among donors, regardless of whether they are related or unrelated/
anonymous, and the clinical and microbiological factors that are of 
importance in donor outcomes remain largely undefined.
The American Gastroenterological Association [AGA] has 
recently set up an FMT registry [http://www.gastro.org/patient-care/
registries-studies/fmt-registry] to help characterise long-term out-
comes of FMT [though this is primarily directed towards Clostridium 
difficile infection], and there are many new studies of FMT in IBD in 
progress [clinicaltrials.gov] that will hopefully address these issues. 
Future directions should also include more specific and targeted 
allied microbiological studies to try to identify donor and recipient 
factors of importance, which may potentially facilitate progress to 
donor-recipient matching, and ultimately defined microbial consor-
tia based on recipient phenotype, along with ongoing development 
of capsule therapy with directed small bowel or colonic release.
