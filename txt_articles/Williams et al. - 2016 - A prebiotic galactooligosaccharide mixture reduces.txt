Abstract
Gut microbes have a substantial influence on systemic immune function and allergic sensitisation. Manipulation of the gut microbiome
through prebiotics may provide a potential strategy to influence the immunopathology of asthma. This study investigated the effects of
prebiotic Bimuno-galactooligosaccharide (B-GOS) supplementation on hyperpnoea-induced bronchoconstriction (HIB), a surrogate for
exercise-induced bronchoconstriction, and airway inflammation. A total of ten adults with asthma and HIB and eight controls without asthma
were randomised to receive 5·5 g/d of either B-GOS or placebo for 3 weeks separated by a 2-week washout period. The peak fall in forced
expiratory volume in 1 s (FEV1) following eucapnic voluntary hyperpnoea (EVH) defined HIB severity. Markers of airway inflammation were
measured at baseline and after EVH. Pulmonary function remained unchanged in the control group. In the HIB group, the peak post-EVH fall
in FEV1 at day 0 (−880 (SD 480) ml) was unchanged after placebo, but was attenuated by 40 % (−940 (SD 460) v. −570 (SD 310) ml, P = 0·004)
after B-GOS. In the HIB group, B-GOS reduced baseline chemokine CC ligand 17 (399 (SD 140) v. 323 (SD 144) pg/ml, P = 0·005) and TNF-α
(2·68 (SD 0·98) v. 2·18 (SD 0·59) pg/ml, P = 0·040) and abolished the EVH-induced 29 % increase in TNF-α. Baseline C-reactive protein was
reduced following B-GOS in HIB (2·46 (SD 1·14) v. 1·44 (SD 0·41) mg/l, P = 0·015) and control (2·16 (SD 1·02) v. 1·47 (SD 0·33) mg/l, P = 0·050)
groups. Chemokine CC ligand 11 and fraction of exhaled nitric oxide remained unchanged. B-GOS supplementation attenuated airway
hyper-responsiveness with concomitant reductions in markers of airway inflammation associated with HIB.
Key words: Asthma: Prebiotics: Airway inflammation: Bronchoconstriction: Gut microbiota
Asthma is a heterogeneous disease that affects approximately
235
million
people
worldwide(1).
It
is
characterised
by
intermittent reversible bronchoconstriction, chronic airway
inflammation and respiratory symptoms such as wheezing,
dyspnoea, chest tightness and cough. The immunopathology of
asthma is predominantly orchestrated by T-helper 2 (TH2) cells
and their pro-inflammatory cytokines and chemokines, which
recruit secondary effector cells including IgE-activated mast
cells, macrophages, basophils and eosinophils(2). Exercise-
induced bronchoconstriction (EIB) is a phenotype of asthma,
which is characterised by transient airway narrowing during
and/or after exercise(3,4). EIB is ascribed to airway drying and
changes in airway osmolality, which result in degranulation of
inflammatory cells and release of inflammatory mediators(4).
Inhaled corticosteroids and short- and long-acting β2-agonists
provide effective therapy for asthma, but they are not curative
nor do they modify disease progression(5). Furthermore, long-
term inhaled corticosteroid use has undesirable side-effects and
adherence is poor, whereas chronic β2-agonist use results in
tolerance(5). The development of therapies that modulate the
immunopathology of asthma without adverse side-effects is
therefore desirable.
Gut microbes have a substantial influence on systemic
immune function and allergic sensitisation(6–8); thus, it is
possible that manipulation of the gut microbiome may provide
a potential strategy to influence the immunopathology of
asthma. The observation that allergic asthma patients display
lower levels of Bifidobacterium adolescentis supports this

 concept(9). Moreover, in humans, 4 weeks of supplementation
with Bifidobacterium breve M-16V combined with a prebiotic
(non-digestible carbohydrate that enhances the growth and/or
activity of beneficial indigenous gut bacteria) improved peak
expiratory flow (PEF) and attenuated serum IL-5 after bronchial
allergen challenge(10).
Prebiotic galactooligosaccharides are derived from the action
of the enzyme β-galactosidase. Bimuno-galactooligosaccharide
(B-GOS) is especially potent in selectively increasing the
growth and/or activity of bifidobacteria(11–15), which has been
shown to elicit beneficial immunomodulatory effects in both
elderly and overweight adults(12,14). In mice exposed to
house dust mites, dietary galactooligosaccharides prevented
the development of airway hyper-responsiveness and airway
eosinophilia and reduced TH2-related cytokine IL-13 and
chemokines (chemokine CC ligand 17 (CCL17), chemokine CC
ligand 5 (CCL5)) in the lungs(16). The effects of B-GOS on
asthma in humans are currently unknown.
In humans, TH2-driven inflammation can be monitored using
biomarkers such as the chemokine CC ligand 11 (CCL11) and
CCL17, along with IgE, TNF-α, C-reactive protein (CRP) and
fraction of exhaled nitric oxide (FENO)(3,17). Eucapnic voluntary
hyperpnoea (EVH) causes a highly reproducible hyperpnoea-
induced bronchoconstriction (HIB) (a surrogate for EIB) in
adults(18), which makes this an excellent challenge test to
evaluate the effects of B-GOS supplementation on airway
hyper-responsiveness.
Therefore, the aim of this study was to test the hypothesis that
B-GOS supplementation in adults with asthma attenuates the
severity of HIB and that this is associated with reduced systemic
concentrations of TH2-driven inflammatory markers.
Methods
Participants and study design
A total of ten participants (five males) formed a HIB group, and
eight participants (five males) with no history of asthma formed
a control group (Fig. 1; Table 1). All participants were
non-smokers. Inclusion criteria for the HIB group were physician
diagnosis of asthma, a baseline forced expiratory volume in 1 s
(FEV1) > 65 % of the predicted(18) and a ≥10 % fall in FEV1
following an initial EVH screening test(19). Participants in the HIB
group were on steps 1–3 of the global initiative for asthma
stepwise approach to asthma control(20).
This study was conducted according to the guidelines laid down
in the Declaration of Helsinki, and all procedures were approved
by the Nottingham Trent University Human Ethics Committee
(Approval no. 229; Clinical Trial no. ISRCTN15022880). All
participants provided their written informed consent. The present
study adopted a randomised (block randomisation), double-blind,
placebo-controlled, cross-over design over 8 consecutive weeks.
Participants were randomly assigned to receive 5·5g/d of either
B-GOS or placebo (maltodextrin) (Clasado Ltd) for 3 weeks.
Thereafter, participants followed a 2-week washout period(11)
(normal diet) before commencing the alternative supplement for
the remaining 3 weeks (Fig. 1). The supplements were identical in
taste and colour, and double blinding was completed by
Clasado Ltd. The B-GOS dose used in the present study has been
shown to consistently increase the number of bifidobacteria
within the gut(11–15).
At day 0 and day 21 of each treatment, baseline FENO was
measured and an EVH test was performed at Nottingham Trent
University. Before and after EVH, pulmonary function was
assessed, and venous blood samples were collected for analysis
of inflammatory markers. HIB participants were permitted to
use their medication as required but stopped taking it before
each EVH test (see below).
Fraction of exhaled nitric oxide, pulmonary function and
eucapnic voluntary hyperpnoea test
Baseline FENO was measured (NIOX MINO; Aerocrine) accord-
ing to American Thoracic Society/European Respiratory Society
(ATS/ERS) guidelines(21) in the HIB group only, as it is elevated in
asthma patients but not in healthy controls(22). In accordance with
ATS/ERS guidelines(23), pulmonary function (forced vital capacity
(FVC), PEF and FEV1) was assessed in triplicate at baseline and in
duplicate at 3, 6, 10, 20 and 30 min after EVH. The highest values
recorded were used for analyses. Whole blood (20 ml) was
collected at baseline and 15 min, 60 min and 24 h after EVH. The
EVH test comprised 6 min of EVH using a dry gas mixture at a
target minute ventilation ð _
VEÞ of 85 % of the predicted maximum
voluntary
ventilation
(30 ×baseline
FEV1)(18,24).
Participants
avoided exercise for 24 h before each EVH test, and participants
in the HIB group stopped taking their medication (inhaled
corticosteroids: 4 d; inhaled long-acting β2 agonists: 2 d; inhaled
short-acting β2 agonists: the day of the test)(24). On EVH test days,
participants abstained from caffeine and alcohol and arrived at the
laboratory >2 h postprandially(18,24).
Analysis of inflammatory markers
Concentrations of serum chemokines CCL11 and CCL17 were
determined using multiplex analysis (Bio-Plex 200; Bio-Rad
Laboratories Limited) and Luminex screening assay plates (R&D
Systems) as previously described(25). ELISA was used to
determine concentrations of TNF-α (R&D Systems), CRP and
IgE (Universal Biologicals). The TNF-α ELISA does not cross-
react with human IL-1β, IL-1α, IL-2-13 or TNF-β and is specific
for the measurement of natural and recombinant human TNF-α.
For TNF-α, the intra- and inter-assay variation was <10 % and
the minimum detectable level of the assay was 0·60 pg/ml,
which all samples exceeded. For CRP and IgE, the minimum
detectable levels of the assays were 0·25 ng/ml and 0·29 KU/l,
respectively, which all samples exceeded.
Statistics
The average minimum perceptible improvement in FEV1 in
adults with asthma is 230 ml(26), whereas the within-participant
standard deviation for the fall in FEV1 after EVH is 100 ml(18). An
a priori sample size calculation revealed that with power = 0·90
and α = 0·05, a sample size of seven would be required to detect
a 230-ml change in the fall in FEV1 after EVH.

Results
Pulmonary function
In the control and HIB groups, there were no between-day
differences in baseline FEV1. Pooled baseline FEV1 tended to be
lower in the HIB group compared with the control group
(P = 0·066) (Table 1).
For the peak fall in FEV1 after EVH, three-way, repeated-
measures ANOVA revealed a treatment × day × group interac-
tion (P < 0·001). In the control group, the peak fall in FEV1 after
EVH was unchanged after placebo and B-GOS (pooled data:
−3 (SD 3) %). In the HIB group, the peak fall in FEV1 after EVH
was unchanged from day 0 (−880 (SD 480) ml) to day 21 (−840
(SD 430) ml) of placebo. Conversely, following B-GOS, the peak
fall in FEV1 after EVH was attenuated by 40 % from day 0 (−940
(SD 460) ml) to day 21 (−570 (SD 310) ml) (mean difference = 370
(SD 290) ml; 95 % CI 166, 575 ml, P = 0·004) (Fig. 2 and 3). In the
control group, the overall severity of HIB, as determined
by
%ΔFEV1AUC0–30,
was
unchanged
after
placebo
and
B-GOS (pooled data: −48 (SD 53) ml). In the HIB group, %
ΔFEV1AUC0–30 was unchanged from day 0 (−530 (SD 384)) to
day 21 (−523 (SD 366)) of placebo, whereas a 41 % reduction
was observed from day 0 (−583 (SD 404)) to day 21 (−345
(SD 267)) of B-GOS (mean difference = − 237 (SD 263); 95 % CI
−425, −48, P = 0·019).

 were not different between control and HIB groups (Table 1).
The peak fall in FVC after EVH was greater in the HIB group
(−18 (SD 16) %; −78 (SD 54) ml) than in the control group
(−3 (SD 2) %; −14 (SD 12) ml) (P = 0·005), but was unchanged in
both groups after placebo and B-GOS. The peak fall in PEF after
EVH was greater in the HIB group (−27 (SD 12) %) than in the
control group (−9 (SD 6) %) (P = 0·007) and was unchanged after
placebo in both groups and after B-GOS in the control group.
Conversely, after B-GOS in the HIB group, the peak fall in PEF
after EVH was reduced from day 0 (−28 (SD 14) %) to day 21
(−17 (SD 10) %) (mean difference = 11 (SD 13) %; 95 % CI 1·8,
20·9 %, P = 0·024).
Serum TNF-α
At day 0, baseline TNF-α was higher in the HIB group (2·64
(SD 0·81)pg/ml) than in the control group (1·37 (SD 0·37)pg/ml)
(P=0·001). A four-way, repeated-measures ANOVA revealed
an
intervention×day×time×group
interaction
(P=0·036).
Subsequent within-group, three-way, repeated-measures ANOVA
revealed an intervention×day×time interaction in the HIB group
only (P=0·042). In the HIB group, TNF-α increased by 29% after
EVH at day 0, and this response was unchanged after placebo.
Conversely, after B-GOS, baseline TNF-α was reduced (mean
difference=0·50 (SD 0·61)pg/ml; 95% CI 0·02, 0·96pg/ml, P=0·04)
and the 29% increase in TNF-α after EVH was completely
abolished (P=0·002) (Fig. 4).
Serum chemokines, C-reactive protein and IgE
In control and HIB groups, serum CCL11, CCL17, CRP and IgE
were unchanged after every EVH test; therefore, subsequent
analyses were performed on baseline data only. In the
control group, baseline CCL11 and CCL17 were unchanged
after both interventions. In the HIB group, baseline CCL11
was unchanged after placebo and B-GOS, and CCL17 was
unchanged after placebo. Conversely, a priori Wilcoxon’s
signed-rank tests revealed a reduction in baseline CCL17 after
B-GOS (P = 0·005; effect size = − 0·88) (Fig. 5).
In control and HIB groups, baseline CRP was unchanged
after
placebo,
whereas
a
priori
Wilcoxon’s
signed-rank
tests revealed a reduction in CRP in control (P = 0·050; effect
size = − 0·49) and HIB (P = 0·015; effect size = − 0·57) groups

 after B-GOS (Fig. 5). Baseline IgE was higher in the HIB group
(pooled data: 37 (SD 17) KU/l) than in the control group (pooled
data: 14 (SD 8) KU/l) (P = 0·006) and no changes were observed
after placebo or B-GOS.
Fraction of exhaled nitric oxide
In the HIB group, baseline FENO (pooled data: 45 (SD 30) ppb)
was unchanged after placebo and B-GOS.
Discussion
The main finding of this study was that supplementation with
B-GOS in adults with asthma attenuated the fall in pulmonary
function after EVH (reduced peak falls in FEV1 and PEF) and
the overall severity of bronchoconstriction (%ΔFEV1AUC0–30).
Furthermore, B-GOS reduced baseline concentrations of CCL17,
CRP and TNF-α and abolished the EVH-induced increase in
TNF-α. These findings suggest that B-GOS can potentially
mediate the underlying immunopathology of asthma, and
thereby attenuate the airway hyper-responsiveness associated
with HIB/EIB.
The 40 % (370 ml) improvement in the post-EVH fall in FEV1
after B-GOS supplementation exceeds the minimum percep-
tible change of 230 ml(26), and is therefore clinically relevant.
Prophylactic use of β2-agonists for EIB prevention/protection is
common because of their efficacy. For example, salbutamol
(200 µg) and salmeterol (50 µg) delivered before exercise
reduced the fall in FEV1 by approximately 78 and 61 %,
respectively(27,28). Comparatively β2-agonists therefore offer
greater protection than B-GOS; however, they are not curative,
and some individuals with EIB either do not respond to
β2-agonists or experience a reduction in severity but not
symptoms(29). Furthermore, chronic use of β2-agonists causes
tolerance
or
β2-receptor
desensitisation
with
associated
symptom
exacerbation(29).
B-GOS
is
well
tolerated(12,14),
and the mechanisms of action may modify the underlying
immunopathological features of asthma(16,30).
The mechanisms by which prebiotics ameliorate airway
hyper-responsiveness remain unclear. Previous studies report
that B-GOS robustly supports the growth of bifidobacteria in the
human gut(11–15) and these microbes may interact with the
intestinal mucosal immune system to enhance immunomodu-
latory effects. Dendritic cell sampling of bifidobacteria and
lactobacilli may alter naïve T-cell differentiation by promoting
an increase in regulatory T-cells expressing Forkhead box
protein P3 (Foxp3) and, subsequently, increased production of
anti-inflammatory cytokines IL-10 and TGF-β(31). Suppression of
effector T-cell formation may partially explain the observed
changes in TNF-α, which is released by mast cells, neutrophils,
eosinophils and airway epithelial cells and causes airway

 hyper-responsiveness. The HIB group had a higher baseline
TNF-α concentration than the control group, which concurs
with previous reports of raised TNF-α in athletes with EIB(32). In
the HIB group, B-GOS supplementation reduced baseline TNF-
α and, remarkably, abolished the EVH-induced increase in TNF-
α. Interestingly, reduced baseline TNF-α concentration after
B-GOS supplementation was previously observed in the
elderly(12). Consequently, the reduced severity of HIB observed
after B-GOS supplementation may be explained by modulation
of the immune system by the gut microbiota, which results in an
attenuated inflammatory response to increased osmolarity of
the airway surface liquid during/following EVH.
Allergic asthma and EIB are characterised by increased TH2
cell infiltration, which is partly controlled by the release of
CCL11, CCL17 and CCL5 from airway epithelium and bronchial
smooth muscle cells(33,34). Baseline serum CCL17 concentration
was similar to that reported previously in individuals with
allergic asthma(35) and tended to be higher in the HIB group
than in the control group. The reduction in CCL17 following
B-GOS supplementation in the HIB group further indicates
reduced systemic chemokine expression, which may lower
infiltration of TH2 lymphocytes into the airways.
Serum CRP is associated with airway inflammation, obstruction
and
bronchial
hyper-responsiveness
in
individuals
with
asthma(36). Consistent with previous reports in the elderly(12), we
observed a reduction in CRP in both HIB and control groups after
B-GOS. Conversely, FENO and serum IgE were unchanged after
B-GOS. FENO is a marker of eosinophilic airway inflammation
that is raised in individuals with asthma(17). However, because of
the heterogeneity of the FENO and IgE measures in the current
cohort, a detectable reduction may require a longer duration of
B-GOS supplementation.
Faecal samples were not collected in the present study to
verify that B-GOS increased the numbers of bifidobacteria.
However, we are confident that this was the case, as the
prebiotic index of B-GOS, which measures the increase in
the
number
of
beneficial
bacteria
(Bifidobacterium
and
Lactobacillus–Enterococcus) compared with the reductions in
less-favourable bacteria (Bacteroides–Prevotella and Clostridium
perfringens–histolyticum), was 0·40 (SD 0·13)(11), and previous
studies have consistently reported an increase in the number
of bifidobacteria within the gut after B-GOS supplementation
in humans(11–15).
In conclusion, B-GOS supplementation reduced the severity of
HIB, and this was associated with reduced systemic concentrations
of TH2-driven inflammatory markers. These findings suggest that
B-GOS, through its impact on the gut microbiota, has the potential
to modulate the underlying immunopathology of asthma, and
thereby attenuate the airway hyper-responsiveness associated
with HIB/EIB. The precise mechanisms by which B-GOS
modulates immune function and reduces airway inflammation
remain unclear and warrant further exploration.
