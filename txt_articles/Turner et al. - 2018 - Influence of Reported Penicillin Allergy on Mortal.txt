Background. Penicillin allergy frequently impacts antibiotic choice. As beta-lactams are superior to vancomycin in treating 
methicillin-susceptible Staphylococcus aureus (MSSA) bacteremia, we examined the effect of reported penicillin allergy on clinical 
outcomes in patients with MSSA bacteremia.
Methods. In this retrospective cohort study of adults with MSSA bacteremia admitted to a large tertiary care hospital, outcomes 
were examined according to reported penicillin allergy. Primary outcomes included 30-day and 90-day mortality rates. Multivariable 
regression models were developed to quantify the effect of reported penicillin allergy on mortality while adjusting for potential 
confounders.
Results. From 2010 to 2015, 318 patients with MSSA bacteremia were identified. Reported penicillin allergy had no significant 
effect on adjusted 30-day mortality (odds ratio [OR], 0.73; 95% confidence interval [CI], 0.29–1.84; P = .51). Patients with reported 
penicillin allergy were more likely to receive vancomycin (38% vs 11%, P < .01), but a large number received cefazolin regardless of 
reported allergy (29 of 66, 44%). Mortality rates were highest among nonallergic patients receiving vancomycin (22.6% vs 7.4% for 
those receiving beta-lactams regardless of reported allergy, P < .01). In multivariable analysis, beta-lactam receipt was most strongly 
associated with survival (OR, 0.26; 95% CI, 0.12–0.54).
Conclusions. Reported penicillin allergy had no significant effect on 30- or 90-day mortality. Non-penicillin-allergic patients 
receiving vancomycin for treatment of MSSA bacteremia had the highest mortality rates overall. Receipt of a beta-lactam was the 
strongest predictor of survival. These results underscore the importance of correct classification of patients with penicillin allergy 
and appropriate treatment with a beta-lactam when tolerated.

Staphylococcus aureus is a leading cause of bacteremia, infective 
endocarditis, and device-related infection [1]. Mortality rates 
for S. aureus bacteremia range from 10% to 50%, influenced in 
part by site of infection and choice of treatment [2, 3]. While 
vancomycin remains the preferred therapy for methicillin-re-
sistant S. aureus (MRSA), beta-lactams are strongly associ-
ated with superior outcomes in methicillin-sensitive S. aureus 
(MSSA) bacteremia [4].
Up to 10% of inpatients report beta-lactam allergies, frequently 
limiting appropriate treatment options for MSSA bacteremia [5, 
6]. While prior studies have evaluated the treatment of patients 
with a reported penicillin allergy and outcomes of various 
antibiotic regimens, to our knowledge none have examined the 
influence of a reported penicillin allergy on MSSA bacteremia 
outcomes directly. We hypothesized that reported penicillin 
allergy might adversely impact survival in MSSA bacteremia by 
influencing treatment. Therefore, we performed this retrospective 
cohort study to quantify the effect of reported penicillin allergy on 
relevant clinical outcomes in adults with MSSA bacteremia.
METHODS
We retrospectively identified all adults with MSSA bacteremia 
admitted to Duke University Hospital (Durham, NC) from 
January 1, 2010, to December 31, 2015. MSSA bacteremia 
was defined as 1 or more blood cultures positive for S. aureus 
that was susceptible to oxacillin per Clinical Laboratory and 
Standards Institute guidelines (minimum inhibitory concen-
tration ≤ 2 µg/mL). We excluded patients with polymicrobial 
bacteremia, those who died before final culture and suscepti-
bility results were available, and those who elected not to pur-
sue treatment (eg, pursued hospice care or left against medical 
advice). Our study was approved by the Institutional Review 
Board of the Duke University Health System.

Data collected retrospectively included each patient’s demo-
graphic characteristics, sequential organ failure assessment 
(SOFA) score on the first day positive blood cultures were 
obtained, comorbid conditions, Charlson comorbidity index, 
reported drug allergies as of the day of admission, antibiotics 
received, duration of therapy, and serum vancomycin trough 
concentrations when available. Reported drug allergies were 
obtained directly from the electronic medical record, as recorded 
by the admitting physician, along with a description of the drug 
reaction when available. The source of infection was recorded 
from either an infectious disease consult note or the relevant dis-
charge summary. Of note, our hospital implemented a policy for 
mandatory infectious diseases consultation for S. aureus bacter-
emia during the latter half of the study period, 2013–2016.
We analyzed 2 factors for association with clinical outcomes. 
Reported penicillin allergy was obtained from each patient’s list 
of drug allergies documented within their admission history 
and physical. Definitive antibiotic choice was defined as the 
antibiotic prescribed once susceptibility results were known. 
Patients who expired before antibiotic susceptibility results 
were available were excluded from analysis. This was done to 
minimize the risk of bias toward worse outcomes with vanco-
mycin given that nearly all patients received vancomycin as part 
of initial empiric therapy. Sensitivity analysis showed no signifi-
cant effect upon including or excluding these patients (data not 
shown).
The primary end points included death at 30 days and death 
at 90 days. Secondary outcomes included time to clearance of 
blood cultures (defined as the number of days from first positive 
to first confirmed negative blood cultures), recurrence of bac-
teremia by 90 days, and incidence of adverse drug events. We 
used standard descriptive statistics. Comparisons between cat-
egorical variables were conducted using either the Fisher exact 
or χ2 where appropriate. Comparisons between continuous 
variables were conducted using t tests. All tests were 2-sided; 
P values were considered significant if <.05. Outcomes of inter-
est were examined first according to reported penicillin allergy, 
as this was our primary question. We next analyzed the data 
according to treatment choice as we hypothesized that reported 
penicillin allergy might influence outcomes indirectly by alter-
ing treatment choice.
Mortality outcomes were also evaluated using multivar-
iable logistic regression. We constructed a stepwise regres-
sion model to adjust for confounders. All variables with 
P < .2 were included initially, with backwards elimination 
to remove confounders with a <10% effect on mortality. We 
did not include receipt of a beta-lactam in the multivariate 
model estimating the effect of reported penicillin allergy, as 
we considered this factor a potential mediator of the effect of 
penicillin allergy on mortality. We used the statistical plat-
form R version 3.4.1 (available at https://www.r-project.org/) 
for all analyses.
RESULTS
Six hundred eighty-seven patients had S. aureus bacteremia 
during the study period. Exclusion of those with methicillin-re-
sistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) infection, polymicro-
bial infection, or those choosing not to pursue treatment left 
335 patients. Of these 335 patients with MSSA bacteremia, 17 
expired before susceptibility results were known and before 
definitive therapy could be chosen. These 17 were excluded 
from analysis, leaving 318 subjects with MSSA bacteremia in 
our final cohort. The majority of patients were male (n = 203, 
64%), and the mean age was 58 (±16) years. The majority of 
patients received a beta-lactam antibiotic (n = 243, 76%). 
A large number of patients reported a penicillin allergy (n = 66, 
21%). Among patients reporting penicillin allergy, the most 
common reactions reported were rash (n = 19, 27%) and hives 
(n = 15, 21%). A complete description of the reaction was not 
available for 15 (21%) cases. Reported penicillin reactions are 
summarized in Table 1. Twenty-nine (44%) reportedly penicil-
lin-allergic patients still received cefazolin. Adverse drug events 
were too infrequent for analysis. Only a single incidence of sus-
pected drug rash was noted in a patient with reported penicil-
lin allergy who received a beta-lactam, along with 2 episodes 
of acute renal injury attributed to antibiotics. No episodes of 
anaphylaxis were noted.
The group with reported penicillin allergy was different than 
the nonallergic group by sex and some comorbidities (Table 2), 
but the 2 groups were similar in terms of overall Charlson 
comorbidity index and sequential organ failure assessment 
(SOFA) scores. There was a trend toward higher frequency 
of catheter infections in non-penicillin-allergic patients and 
a higher frequency of endovascular or soft tissue infection in 
penicillin-allergic patients (Table 3), though only the latter 2 
reached statistical significance. Mortality rates were not sig-
nificantly different between penicillin-allergic and non-pen-
icillin-allergic patients at 30 days (10.6% vs 11.9%, P = .99) 
or 90 days (13.6% vs 18.3%, P = .47) in univariate analysis. 
Penicillin-allergic patients were slower to clear blood cultures 
(6.2 days vs 4.1 days, P < .01) and more likely to suffer recur-
rence within 90 days (7% vs 1.5%, P = .02).

When analyzed according to choice of definitive treatment, 
patients receiving vancomycin were more likely to have pen-
icillin allergy, underlying diabetes, or renal disease, and they 
carried slightly higher mean SOFA scores (3.7 vs 2.9, P = .04) 
and Charlson comorbidity indices (6.6 vs 5.5, P = .03) (Table 4). 
Compared with patients treated with beta-lactam antibiotics, 
patients treated with vancomycin had higher mortality rates at 
30 days (22.6% vs 7.4%, P = .002) and 90 days (26.4% vs 13.6%, 
P = .036) on univariate analysis. Patients who received beta-
lactam antibiotics were more likely to have had an infectious 
diseases (ID) consultation than those receiving vancomycin, 
though the difference was not statistically significant (65% vs 
53%, P = .12). Mortality rates were lower overall for patients 
receiving an ID consultation (8.7% vs 16.3% at 30 days, P = .04; 
13.9% vs 22.8% at 90 days, P = .05). The initiation of mandatory 
ID consultation did not impact this finding (data not shown).
We next created a multivariable logistic regression model 
to quantify the effect of reported penicillin allergy on mor-
tality outcomes while accounting for potential confounders. 
Our initial models included age >65 years, sex, SOFA score, 
cancer, heart failure, kidney disease, skin/soft tissue source of 
infection, osteoarticular source of infection, penicillin allergy, 
and ID consultation. Both the 30- and 90-day models achieved 
c-statistics >0.8. Severity of illness represented by the SOFA 
score was the strongest independent predictor of 30-day mortal-
ity in our adjusted model (Table 5). The following factors were 
independently associated with 90-day mortality in our adjusted 
model: age >65 years, SOFA score, and congestive heart failure. 
Reported penicillin allergy had no significant effect on mortal-
ity at 30 or 90 days.
Considering that a significant proportion of patients with 
reported penicillin allergy still received cefazolin (44%, n = 29), 
we recreated the multivariable models to assess the effect of 
receiving a beta-lactam antibiotic on 30- and 90-day mortal-
ity (Table 6). Receipt of a beta-lactam was strongly protective 
against mortality at 30 and 90 days.
Thirty-day mortality outcomes were stratified accord-
ing to both penicillin allergy and definitive antibiotic 
choice in Figure 1. No significant difference was noted in 
univariate analysis comparing mortality rates for penicil-
lin-allergic or non-penicillin-allergic patients based on 
the definitive treatment received. We conducted additional 
analysis of these subgroups to test for possible interaction 
between reported penicillin allergy and receipt of a beta-
lactam (Table 7). As predicted in our model, receipt of a 
beta-lactam was protective irrespective of penicillin allergy 
whereas vancomycin use was associated with higher rates of 
30-day mortality. An interaction term was not significant in 
our final model but allowed us to calculate adjusted odds

ratios for these subgroups. The single largest predictor of 
mortality was receipt of vancomycin among non-penicil-
lin-allergic patients (odds ratio, 4.6; 95% confidence inter-
val, 2.16–9.84; P < .001 compared with the subgroup who 
received a beta-lactam and had no penicillin allergy).
Recognizing the known limitations of patient-reported drug 
allergy and the high prevalence of reported penicillin allergy 
(21%) in our cohort, we conducted a sensitivity analysis using a 
more stringent definition of penicillin allergy to assure against 
misclassification bias. According to the more stringent defin-
ition, only patients reporting anaphylaxis, hives, dyspnea, or 
angioedema/swelling were considered allergic. With the more 
stringent definition, incidence of penicillin allergy in our cohort 
fell to 9.2%—in agreement with previously reported prevalence 
rates [5, 6]. On sensitivity analysis, our modeled effect measures 
remained unchanged (data not shown).
We conducted a post hoc comparison between nafcillin and 
cefazolin given prior hypothetical concerns for inferior out-
comes with cefazolin in deep-seated infections (Table 8) [7, 8]. 
 
Despite patients receiving cefazolin having higher SOFA 
scores (3.5 vs 2.2, P ≤ .01) and higher Charlson comorbidity 
indices (6.5 vs 4.5, P ≤ .01), we found no significant difference 
in 30-day (8.6% for nafcillin vs 6.3% for cefazolin, P = .63) or 
90-day (12.9% vs 14.2%, P = .85) mortality rates. A higher inci-
dence of renal disease in patients receiving cefazolin (65% vs 
42%, P < .01) may explain the trend toward higher SOFA and

DISCUSSION
While prior studies have assessed the effects of different anti-
biotics on outcomes in MSSA bacteremia, few have examined 
the effect of reported penicillin allergy [7]. In this retrospective 
cohort study, reported penicillin allergy did not significantly 
impact 30- or 90-day mortality rates. While the overall preva-
lence of reported penicillin allergy was higher than previously 
reported, many of these reactions were either undocumented 
or involved a nonspecific rash. Nearly half of penicillin-aller-
gic patients were still safely treated with cefazolin—consistent 
with either over-reporting of allergy or the low incidence rate 
for cross-reactivity with cefazolin in particular [8]. Patients 
receiving beta-lactams consistently had the lowest mortality 
rates (7.4%), regardless of reported allergy history, even after 
we applied a more stringent allergy definition. This suggests 
that reported penicillin allergy was not an accurate marker for 
clinically relevant reactions concerning enough to avoid cepha-
losporins. The most striking mortality gap is the 4-fold greater 
mortality rate for nonallergic patients receiving vancomycin 
instead of a beta-lactam. Multivariable modeling also con-
firmed receipt of a beta-lactam as the single strongest predictor 
of survival, regardless of reported allergy history or adjustment 
for more stringent criteria defining penicillin allergy. These 
data highlight 2 crucial points for improving outcomes in MSSA 
bacteremia. First, a reported penicillin allergy only matters if it 
prevents a patient from receiving a beta-lactam. Second, while 
clearly over-reported, penicillin allergy is not the only reason 
that patients are missing out on optimal therapy.
The superiority of beta-lactams over vancomycin in treating 
MSSA bacteremia is consistent with several prior studies [9–19]. 
In our study, vancomycin use was associated with a 3-fold higher 
mortality rate at 30 days (P = .002) and a 2-fold higher mortality 
rate at 90 days (P = .036). Others have separately examined the 
influence of reported penicillin allergy on treatment choice—
concluding that penicillin allergy was associated with an 
increased likelihood of receiving vancomycin by nearly 3-fold, 
in close agreement with the 3.3-fold increase we found [7].
With such a stark difference in mortality rates, and clear evi-
dence that patients with a reported penicillin allergy can still 
achieve superior outcomes if they receive another beta-lactam, 
our data suggest that every effort should be made to ensure 
that patients with MSSA bacteremia receive a beta-lactam. 
These efforts take several forms. Simple interventions such 
as an enhanced drug allergy history may reveal that patients 
can safely tolerate cephalosporins, as was the case for 44% of 
our penicillin-allergic cohort. In prior studies of patients with 
reported allergies, nearly 50% of patients could be transitioned 
to a beta-lactam based on more detailed drug history alone [20, 
21]. When uncertainty persists, penicillin skin testing can be 
used to determine whether penicillin antibiotics can be given 
safely [22–28]. Formal testing confirms 5% or less of reported 
penicillin allergies—permitting still more patients to receive 
preferred therapy [5]. While all of these interventions are 
being actively applied and studied presently (including at our 
own institution), the question of how to manage the remain-
ing patients with true penicillin allergy remains. A 2- to 3-fold 
increase in mortality seems unacceptable for second-line ther-
apy of a treatable disease (in this case, use of vancomycin). It 
may be time to consider desensitization as a preferred next step 
in the management of MSSA bacteremia for the truly allergic 
patients. Certainly the precedent exists when other medications 
are felt to be crucial to outcomes (eg, penicillin desensitization 
for neuro-syphilis or aspirin desensitization for coronary artery 
disease). As far as we are aware, no studies have examined this 
strategy to date.

Until desensitization can be fully evaluated as a treatment for 
MSSA bacteremia in penicillin-allergic patients, cefazolin often 
becomes the default beta-lactam in the subset of patients aller-
gic to penicillin but tolerant of cephalosporins. The use of cefa-
zolin carries with it some concerns based on a few case reports 
describing treatment failures, particularly in deep-seated MSSA 
infections, theoretically attributed to an inoculum effect [29, 
30]. To add to the body of evidence addressing these concerns, 
we also conducted a post hoc subanalysis comparing outcomes 
between nafcillin and cefazolin and found no significant differ-
ence in 30- or 90-day mortality rates, despite patients receiving 
cefazolin having higher mean SOFA and Charlson comorbidity 
scores. Cefazolin’s ability to achieve similar outcomes despite 
predictors usually associated with higher mortality is both reas-
suring and consistent with prior evidence [13, 14]. Indeed, the 
recently published literature suggests that outcomes with cefa-
zolin are comparable to outcomes with nafcillin but with fewer 
adverse effects [31].
Outside of the issues surrounding treatment of penicillin-al-
lergic patients, the remaining nonallergic patients who received 
vancomycin (nearly 10% in our study) pose a distinct challenge 
worthy of further study as well. Vancomycin might be chosen for 
a variety of other reasons—including persistent knowledge gaps 
among providers regarding vancomycin’s efficacy in MSSA bac-
teremia, concern for alternate sources of infection or other path-
ogens, or the impression of convenient dosing (eg, infrequent 
dosing or dosing with dialysis). Investigating the reasons for van-
comycin use other than true drug allergy might help target qual-
ity improvement or antimicrobial stewardship efforts and prevent 
the use of a less efficacious drug in this population as well.
Our study carries several limitations. First, penicillin allergy 
was determined based on documentation in the history and 
physical, which has known problems with measurement error 
[32, 33]. While the prevalence of penicillin allergy was high, a 
significant proportion of reactions were either unspecified or 
nonspecific—consistent with likely over-reporting of penicillin 
allergy. We conducted a sensitivity analysis using a more strin-
gent allergy definition to assess for misclassification bias, with 
no alteration in any of our primary effect measures. Irrespective 
of accuracy, reported drug allergy remains clinically relevant 
given that treatment decisions are typically made based on the 
treating physician’s assessment. Second, we did not have suffi-
cient numbers to adequately assess adverse drug events. Third, 
any comparisons with vancomycin must be considered with the 
caveat that vancomycin troughs were not available for many 
patients, particularly after discharge, and thus we are unable to 
assure therapeutic levels for the duration of treatment. Finally, 
given the diversity of infections included, we were unable to 
include an assessment of source control as another factor poten-
tially influencing mortality. We hope to incorporate these add-
itional factors in our ongoing and future research.
In summary, reported penicillin drug allergy did not equate 
with increased mortality in MSSA bacteremia in our cohort. 
We believe this is because nearly half of the labeled “allergic” 
group still received a beta-lactam. Receipt of a beta-lactam, 
including the use of cefazolin in many patients with reported 
penicillin allergy, was the single strongest predictor of survival. 
Conversely, patients receiving vancomycin—whether due to 
a drug allergy history or other reasons—suffered 2- to 3-fold 
higher mortality rates. In particular, patients who received van-
comycin without a drug allergy had the highest mortality risk. 
Further investigation is needed to understand why some non-
allergic patients still receive vancomycin. These data highlight 
2 crucial points for improving outcomes in MSSA bacteremia. 
First, penicillin allergy only matters if it prevents a patient from 
receiving a beta-lactam. Second, penicillin allergy is not the only 
reason that patients are missing out on optimal therapy. Future 
efforts should include improvement of allergy assessment and 
documentation, de-labeling patients based on reactions uncon-
cerning for true allergy, and perhaps even desensitization for 
truly penicillin-allergic patients.
