Abstract
Importance—The aging of the US population is expected to lead to a large increase in the 
number of adults with dementia, but some recent studies in the US and other high-income 
countries suggest that the age-specific risk of dementia may have declined over the last 25 years. 
Clarifying current and future population trends in dementia prevalence and risk has important 
implications for patients, families, and government programs.
Objective—To compare the prevalence of dementia in the United States in 2000 and 2012.
Design—We used data from the Health and Retirement Study (HRS), a nationally representative 
population-based longitudinal survey of US adults.
Setting—Population-based prospective cohort of US adults.

 Participants—Individuals aged 65 or older from the 2000 (N = 10,546) and 2012 (N = 10,511) 
waves of the HRS.
Main Outcomes and Measures—Dementia was identified in each year using HRS cognitive 
measures and validated methods for classifying self-respondents, as well as those represented by a 
proxy. Logistic regression was used to identify socioeconomic and health variables associated with 
change in dementia prevalence between 2000 and 2012.
Results—Dementia prevalence among those aged 65 or older decreased from 11.6% in 2000 to 
8.8% (8.6% with age- and sex-standardization) in 2012 (P < 0.001). More years of education was 
associated with a lower risk for dementia, and average years of education increased significantly 
(from 11.8 to 12.7 years; P < 0.001) between 2000 and 2012. The decline in dementia prevalence 
occurred even though there was a significant age- and sex-adjusted increase between years in the 
cardiovascular risk profile (e.g., prevalence of hypertension, diabetes, and obesity) among older 
US adults.
Conclusions—The prevalence of dementia in the United States declined significantly between 
2000 and 2012. An increase in educational attainment was associated with some of the decline in 
dementia prevalence, but the full set of social, behavioral, and medical factors contributing to the 
decline is still uncertain. Continued monitoring of trends in dementia incidence and prevalence 
will be important for better gauging the full future societal impact of dementia as the number of 
older adults increases in the decades ahead.
Introduction
Dementia, a decline in memory and other cognitive functions that lead to a loss of 
independent function, is a common and feared geriatric syndrome that affects an estimated 4 
to 5 million older adults in the United States,1 and has a large social and economic impact 
on patients, families, and government programs.2 Although the number of older adults with 
dementia in the US and around the world is expected to grow up to three-fold by 2050 due to 
the large increase in the size of the elderly population,3 recent studies suggest that the age-
specific risk of dementia may have actually declined in some high-income countries over the 
past 25 years, perhaps due to increasing levels of education and better control of key 
cardiovascular risk factors, such as hypertension, diabetes, and hypercholesterolemia.4–6 For 
instance, the incidence of dementia among older participants in the Framingham Heart Study 
declined by about 20% per decade between 1977 and 2008, and the decline in risk was seen 
only among those with at least a high school education.7
If confirmed in representative populations, a decline in age-specific risk for dementia would 
have important implications for public health and public policy. For instance, a recent 
population-based study of dementia in England found a 24% decline in the expected number 
of cases of dementia between 1991 and 2011 (a 6.5% prevalence among older adults in 
2011, compared to 8.3% in 1991, p=0.003), which translates to more than 200,000 fewer 
cases of dementia.8
There have been changes over the last two to three decades in both the prevalence and 
treatment of cardiovascular risk factors that also influence the risk for dementia. For 
instance, 23% of US adults were obese in 1990 compared to 35% in 20129,10; among adults

 aged 65+, the prevalence of diabetes increased from 9% to 21%.10 However, intensity of 
treatment for diabetes, hypertension, and high cholesterol has increased with more patients 
achieving treatment goals, and a significant decline in the vascular complications of diabetes 
such as heart attack, stroke, and lower-extremity amputations,11 suggesting that there could 
be a “spill-over” benefit of a decline in the vascular-related risk for dementia.4,7
Rising levels of education among US adults over the past 25 years may also have contributed 
to decreased dementia risk. The proportion of adults aged 65 or older with a high school 
diploma increased from 53% in 1990 to 80% in 2010, while the proportion with a college 
degree increased from 11% to 23%.12 More years of formal education is associated with a 
reduced risk of dementia, likely through multiple causal pathways, including a direct effect 
on brain development and function (i.e., the building of “cognitive reserve”), health 
behaviors, as well as the general health advantages of having more wealth and 
opportunities.13–15
To further address these questions, we used the Health and Retirement Study (HRS), a large 
nationally representative prospective cohort study of US adults, to test whether the age-
specific prevalence of dementia declined in the United States between 2000 and 2012. Since 
most prior studies of dementia trends have used samples from geographically-restricted 
regions and with limited representation of minority populations, we could determine if those 
studies’ findings were replicated in a sample representative of the US population.
Methods
Data and Study Sample
We used data from the 2000 and 2012 waves of the HRS. The HRS is a biennial, survey of 
US adults that started in 1992 and collects a wide-range of data on health, cognition, family, 
employment, and wealth.16 The HRS follows respondents longitudinally until death, and 
new cohorts have been enrolled at different times since the 1992 baseline interviews in order 
to maintain population representativeness as the study sample has aged.16 As a result, 4,008 
individuals in our analysis were included in both the 2000 and 2012 cohorts, while 6,538 
were included only in 2000 and 6,503 only in 2012.
Our study sample included all HRS participants aged 65 or older, living in the community or 
in nursing homes in 2000 and 2012. There were 10,546 respondents in 2000 and 10,516 
respondents in 2012, after excluding 165 (1.5%) and 218 (2.0%) respondents from the 2000 
and 2012 samples, respectively, due to missing data for one or more covariates used in the 
analysis. If a respondent is unable or unwilling to participate in the survey, the HRS attempts 
to identify a proxy respondent (usually a spouse or adult child) to complete the survey for 
them. There were 1,317 (12.5% unweighted) respondents represented by a proxy in 2000 
and 860 (8.2% unweighted) in 2012. The response rate for the full HRS sample was 88% in 
2000 and 89% in 2012.17
Informed consent to participate in the HRS is obtained from all respondents. The HRS has 
been approved by the Health Sciences and Behavioral Sciences IRB at the University of 
Michigan.

 Measurement of Cognitive Function and Cognitive Category Definitions
The HRS assesses cognitive function in self-respondents with a range of tests adapted from 
the Telephone Interview for Cognitive Status (TICS). Based on our prior work,18 we used a 
27-point cognitive scale that included an immediate and delayed 10-noun free recall test, a 
serial seven subtraction test, and a backwards count from 20 test. Cut-points for normal, 
cognitive impairment—no dementia (CIND), and dementia were validated against the 
prevalence of CIND and dementia in the Aging, Demographics, and Memory Study 
(ADAMS), an HRS sub-study of Alzheimer’s disease and dementia that used a 3–4 hour in-
home neuropsychological and clinical assessment as well as expert clinician adjudication to 
obtain a “gold-standard” diagnosis of CIND or dementia.18,19 Respondents who scored from 
0 to 6 on the 27-point scale were classified as having dementia, 7 to 11 as having CIND, and 
12 to 27 as normal.
For respondents represented by a proxy, an 11-point scale was developed using the proxy’s 
assessment of the respondent’s memory ranging from excellent to poor (score 0–4), the 
proxy’s assessment of whether the respondent had limitations in five instrumental activities 
of daily living (IADLs; managing money, taking medication, preparing hot meals, using 
phones, and doing groceries; score 0–5), and the survey interviewer’s assessment of whether 
the respondent had difficulty completing the interview because of a cognitive limitation 
(score 0–2 indicating, none, some, and prevents completion). Using this information, 
respondents with high scores (6–11) were classified as having dementia, and those with mid-
range scores (3–5) as having CIND.18
Using the ADAMS dementia diagnosis as the gold standard, this categorization method 
correctly classifies 78% of HRS respondents as having dementia or not (76% of self-
respondents and 84% of those represented by a proxy).18
More detail on the HRS self-report and proxy cognition measures is available at the HRS 
web site.20
Independent Variables Used as Covariates
The following sociodemographic measures were included in the regression analyses as 
independent variables: age, self-reported race/ethnicity (white, black, Hispanic, other), sex, 
education (<12 years; 12 years; 13 to 15 years, and ≥ 16 years), and net worth (quartiles in 
year 2000 dollars). The self-reported chronic medical conditions and cardiovascular risk 
factors included were: stroke, diabetes, heart disease, hypertension, and body-mass index 
(BMI, derived from self-reported height and weight). All of these sociodemographic and 
health measures were selected for inclusion in the regression analyses a priori, based on 
prior studies suggesting that they are associated with dementia risk.
Analytic Framework
For descriptive analyses (Tables 1 and 2), the 2012 sample was age- and sex-standardized to 
the 2000 population using direct standardization. For multivariable analyses (Table 4), we 
pooled data from 2000 and 2012 and estimated logistic regression models with a 
dichotomous dependent variable indicating whether an individual had dementia (the

 reference group included those with normal cognition or CIND). A linear trend variable that 
took the value of 0 in 2000 and 1 in 2012 was included in the regression models. An odds 
ratio (OR) less than 1 for this trend variable would indicate a decrease in the prevalence of 
dementia (i.e., a decrease in the overall odds of dementia among the 65+ population) 
between 2000 and 2012. We estimated four separate logistic models with different sets of 
independent variables added sequentially (e.g., trend variable only, an age- and sex-adjusted 
model, and then subsequent models that included sociodemographic variables and then 
health variables) in order to better assess which variables were associated with a change in 
the prevalence of dementia between 2000 and 2012. We tested for interactions between each 
independent variable and the year of observation.
Statistical analyses were performed using STATA (Release 13.1, Stata Corp, College Station, 
TX). HRS sampling weights were used to adjust for non-response and the complex sampling 
design of the HRS survey.
Results
Characteristics of the Study Sample
Table 1 shows the characteristics of the 2000 and 2012 study cohorts (with age- and sex-
standardization to the 2000 cohort). Compared to the 2000 cohort, the 2012 cohort had a 
significantly larger proportion of those who were aged 85 or older, but the average age for 
the full cohort was similar across the two years. The 2012 cohort had significantly more 
years of education; individuals with fewer than 12 years of education comprised 32.6% of 
the sample in 2000, but only 20.6% in 2012 (P<0.001). On average, individuals in the 2012 
cohort had nearly 1 more year of education, compared to those in the 2000 cohort (12.7 
years vs. 11.8 years, P<0.001). There was a greater disparity in household net worth in 2012 
(in constant 2000 dollars), with a greater proportion of the 2012 cohort in both the lowest 
and highest wealth quartiles (P=0.02).
The 2012 cohort had significantly higher rates of self-reported cardiovascular risk factors, 
including obesity (29.2% in 2012 vs. 18.3% in 2000, P<0.001), diabetes (24.7% vs. 16.4%, 
P<0.001), and hypertension (67.6% vs. 54.6%, P<0.001). The prevalence of heart disease 
increased from 29.1% to 31.8% between 2000 and 2012 (P<0.001), but the prevalence of 
stroke did not change significantly. There was a small decline between 2000 and 2012 in the 
proportion of individuals with 1 or more IADL limitations, but this change was not 
significant (P=0.14). The proportion of the sample living in a nursing home at the time of 
their HRS interview declined from 4.4% in 2000 to 2.8% in 2012 (P<0.001), and the 
weighted and standardized proportion of the HRS sample represented by a proxy respondent 
declined from 12.1% in 2000 to 6.6% in 2012 (P<0.001).
Trend in Prevalence and Adjusted Relative Risk of Dementia
Table 2 displays the weighted percentage of individuals in each cognitive function category 
in 2000 and 2012, and shows a significant decrease in the proportion of individuals aged 65+ 
with dementia between 2000 and 2012 (11.6% in 2000 compared to 8.8% in 2012 
[P<0.001]). The prevalence of CIND also decreased significantly across the 2 cohorts from 
Langa et al.

 21.2% to 18.8% (P<0.001). After age- and sex-standardizing the 2012 cohort to the 2010 
cohort, the decline in dementia prevalence was slightly greater (8.6% in 2012) because of 
the greater proportion of those who were age 85+ in 2012. Tables 3a and 3b provide results 
stratified by age groups (65–74, 75–84, and 85+).
Table 4 reports the results of four different logistic regression models with the presence of 
dementia as the outcome variable, using pooled 2000 and 2012 data. The trend variable in 
the first row of the table represents the odds ratio (OR) of dementia in 2012 compared to 
2000. Model 1 shows the significant decline (OR = 0.73, 95% CI: 0.67 to 0.82 ) in 
unadjusted dementia prevalence already noted in Table 2, and Model 2 shows the OR after 
adjusting for differences across the cohorts in age and sex (OR = 0.69, 95% CI: 0.62 to 
0.77 ). Controlling for education, net worth, and race (Model 3) explained 9 percentage 
points of the decrease in age- and sex-standardized odds of dementia between 2000 and 
2012 (OR = 0.78, 95% CI: 0.70 to 0.88), while the addition of cardiovascular risk factors 
and BMI (Model 4) accounted for 4 additional percentage points of the decline in prevalence 
(OR = 0.82, 95% CI: 0.73 to 0.92) In the fully adjusted model (Model 4), more years of 
education and higher net worth were associated with a significantly lower odds of dementia, 
while older age, being African-American or Hispanic, and having a history of stroke or 
diabetes were all associated with increased odds. Being underweight was also associated 
with higher odds of dementia, while being overweight or obese was associated with lower 
odds of dementia, compared to those at normal BMI.
When testing for an interaction effect between each independent variable and year, 
controlling for the main effects of all other variables, heart disease had a significantly lower 
OR for dementia in 2012 compared to 2000 (P<0.001). No other interactions were 
significant at the P<0.05 level.
Discussion
In a large nationally representative survey of older Americans we found that, among those 
aged 65 or older, the prevalence of dementia decreased from 11.6% to 8.8% between 2000 
and 2012, representing an absolute decrease of 2.8 percentage points, and a relative decrease 
of about 24%. Educational attainment increased significantly, with those aged 65+ in 2012 
having nearly one additional year of education compared to the 2000 cohort. After 
controlling for the socioeconomic factors of education, wealth, and race / ethnicity, 
controlling for changes in the prevalence of cardiovascular risk factors did not explain much 
of the additional difference in dementia risk across the two cohorts.
Our study, along with prior studies, supports the notion that “cognitive reserve” resulting 
from early-life and life-long education and cognitive stimulation may be a potent strategy for 
the primary prevention of dementia in both high- and low-income countries around the 
world.21 However, it should be noted that the relationships among education, brain biology, 
and cognitive function are complex and likely multi-directional; for instance, a number of 
recent population-based studies have shown genetic links with level of educational 
attainment,22,23 and with the risk for cognitive decline in later-life.24 Higher levels of 
educational attainment are also associated with health behaviors (e.g., physical activity, diet,

 and smoking), more cognitively-complex occupations, and better access to health care, all of 
which may play a role in decreasing lifetime dementia risk.
The prevalence of obesity and diabetes among those aged 65+ increased significantly 
between 2000 and 2012, and diabetes was associated with 39% higher odds of dementia, 
after controlling for all other factors. As in prior studies among older adults, we found that 
obesity was associated with a decreased risk of dementia, consistent with the hypothesis 
that, while obesity in mid-life may increase risk for later-life cognitive decline and dementia, 
obesity at older ages may be associated with cognitive and other health advantages.25–27 The 
trend toward a declining risk for dementia in the face of a large increase in the prevalence of 
diabetes suggests that improvements in treatments between 2000 and 2012 may have 
decreased dementia risk, along with the documented declines in the incidence of common 
diabetes-related complications such as heart attack, stroke, and amputations.11 Our finding 
of a significant decline between 2000 and 2012 of the heart disease-related OR for dementia 
would also be consistent with improved cardiovascular treatments leading to a decline in 
dementia risk. To explore this hypothesis further, we used additional HRS data on self-
reported treatments for diabetes (either oral medications or insulin). The proportion of adults 
with diabetes reporting either oral medication or insulin use increased from 86% in 2000 to 
90% in 2012 (P <0 .01). Further, the interaction of diabetes treatment by survey year in our 
regression model was statistically significant (P<0.01), suggesting that diabetes treatment in 
2012 was associated with a significantly lower OR of dementia compared to 2000.
Our findings are consistent with a number of recent studies that also found declines in 
dementia incidence or prevalence in high-income countries around the world,6–8,28–31 and 
also suggest that the trend toward a declining prevalence of cognitive impairment or 
dementia in the US that we found between 1993 and 2002 using earlier waves of the HRS 
data13 has continued through 2012, even with significant increases in the prevalence of 
cardiovascular risk factors that may increase dementia risk. Our findings are consistent with 
the declining incidence of dementia found over the past four decades in the Framingham 
Heart Study,7 as well as the decline in dementia prevalence between 1991 and 2011 in the 
Cognitive Function and Ageing Study (CFAS) in England.8 Both the Framingham and CFAS 
studies also pointed to increases in education and better control of cardiovascular risk factors 
as likely contributors to declining dementia risk.7,8
Our study has several limitations. Our dementia diagnosis is based on a limited set of 
cognitive tests, although prior validation studies show a 78% concordance for dementia 
diagnosis when using these tests compared to the detailed ADAMS clinical evaluation.18 
The recent Framingham7 and CFAS8 studies both used more extensive cognitive testing and 
clinical information when making a dementia diagnosis in their studies, so likely have less 
diagnostic mis-classification. In addition, although we used a validated method to define 
diagnostic categories for both self-respondents and respondents represented by a proxy, the 
proportion of the HRS sample represented by a proxy declined significantly between 2000 
and 2012 (from 12.5% to 8.2% unweighted), likely due in part to a change in HRS field 
procedures between these two waves. In 2006, the HRS purposefully increased the 
proportion of interviews administered face-to-face in respondents’ homes, and decreased the 
proportion administered by phone. Since 2006, about one-half of HRS interviews at each

 wave have been administered face-to-face, while prior to 2006 only about 20% were face-to-
face. This shift in survey mode likely encouraged an increase in self-interviews that in prior 
waves would have been completed by proxy, possibly leading to a change in the calibration 
of the self- and proxy-cognitive measures to dementia status. Another potential limitation is 
that changes in diagnostic thresholds and in the frequency of diagnostic testing between 
2000 and 2012 may have affected the self-reported prevalence of cardiovascular risk factors, 
and the relationship of treatments to both cardiovascular and cognitive outcomes. Finally, the 
accuracy of self-report of cardiovascular risk factors may be less reliable for those with 
cognitive impairment or dementia.
In conclusion, using nationally representative data we found a significant decline in 
dementia prevalence among older US adults between 2000 and 2012, using the same 
cognitive measures and the same diagnostic classification strategy in both years. Increases in 
the level of education among the later-born cohort accounted for some of the decreased 
dementia risk, and there was some evidence that improvements in treatments for 
cardiovascular risk factors (e.g., diabetes) may also have played a role. However, the full set 
of social, behavioral, and medical factors contributing to the decline in dementia prevalence 
is still uncertain. Continued monitoring of trends in dementia incidence and prevalence will 
be important for better gauging the full future societal impact of dementia as the number of 
older adults increases in the decades ahead, as well as for clarifying potential protective and 
risk factors for cognitive decline.
