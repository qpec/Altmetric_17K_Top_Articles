Introduction
Atrial fibrillation
Atrial fibrillation is the most common heart rhythm dis-
turbance associated with high mortality, morbidity and 
hospitalisation.1 The most important risk factors for 
developing atrial fibrillation are increasing age and hyper-
tension.2 Episodes of paroxysmal atrial fibrillation (PAF) 
can cause symptoms such as anxiety, stress and worry. 
Patients with PAF experience deterioration in health 
related quality of life (QoL) compared to the general pop-
ulation and patients with other cardiovascular diseases. 
This may potentially increase mortality, morbidity and

Abstract
Background: Patients with atrial fibrillation often have an impaired quality of life (QoL). Practising yoga may decrease 
stress and have positive effects on mental and physical health. The aim of this study was to investigate whether yoga can 
improve QoL and decrease blood pressure and heart rate in patients with paroxysmal atrial fibrillation (PAF).
Methods: In this pilot study, 80 patients diagnosed with PAF were randomized to standard treatment (control group, 
n=40) or standard treatment in combination with yoga (yoga group, n=40) during a 12-week period. QoL, blood pressure 
and heart rate were evaluated at baseline and at the end of the study (12 (+2) weeks). EuroQoL-5D (EQ-5D) Visual 
Analogue Scale (VAS) and the two dimensions in Short-Form Health Survey (SF-36) were used to evaluate QoL.
Results: At baseline there was a significant difference in QoL between the groups in EQ-5D VAS- scale (p=0.02) and 
SF-36 mental health score (p<0.001) in which the control group had higher scores. At the end of the study, the yoga 
group averaged higher SF-36 mental health scores. There was a significant difference between the two groups (p=0.016), 
but no differences in EQ-5D VAS- scale and physiological health score was seen between the two groups. At the end of 
the study, the yoga group had significantly lower heart rate (p=0.024) and systolic (p=0.033) and diastolic blood pressure 
(p<0.001) compared to the control group.
Conclusions: Yoga with light movements and deep breathing may lead to improved QoL, lower blood pressure and 
lower heart rate in patients with PAF compared to a control group. Yoga could be a complementary treatment method 
to standard therapy.

hospitalisation.3–6 PAF can also cause a decreased QoL 
among patients with a high arrhythmia burden and a high 
heart rate.7 To handle the emotional consequences that 
comes with atrial fibrillation the patients need practical 
tools.8 The standard treatment for PAF is medication, car-
dio version and ablation – to prevent severe complica-
tions, such as stroke. Reducing symptoms is the primary 
treatment goal for patients with PAF.1
Yoga
Yoga practice consists of breathing techniques (pranay-
ama) and meditation (dhyana) in combination with vari-
ous physical exercises (asanas).9 Yoga is known to affect 
both the parasympathetic and sympathetic nervous sys-
tems. Practising yoga can improve QoL10 and as a result 
of its positive impact in reducing heart rate11 and decreas-
ing blood pressure,12 it may be useful in ameliorating 
various medical conditions. The effect of yoga however 
is under debate because many studies are small and not 
randomized.13,14
The aim of this study was to investigate whether yoga 
can improve QoL and decrease blood pressure and heart 
rate in patients with PAF.
Methods
This randomized pilot study was conducted at Danderyd 
Hospital in Stockholm, Sweden. The inclusion criterion 
was a diagnosis of PAF necessitating pharmacological 
treatment. Patients with difficulties understanding the 
Swedish language and patients with multiple concurrent 
medical conditions (i.e. cancer, heart failure and renal fail-
ure with symptoms) or cognitive dysfunction were consid-
ered to have too many difficulties to perform yoga in a 
group session and were therefore excluded. The partici-
pants had either early or new diagnosis of PAF and should 
have been on medical treatment for PAF for at least three 
months. Eighty–eight patients with PAF were consecutive 
identified from medical records at the arrhythmia 
department’s out-patient clinic and asked by telephone to 
participate. Eighty patients fulfilled the inclusion criteria 
and were accepted to participate in the study. Upon the 
baseline visit, the 80 patients were randomized; 40 patients 
were included in the yoga group and 40 patients in the con-
trol group (Figure 1). A permuted block randomization 
inspired by Polit and Beck15 was used. The patients were 
randomly assigned in blocks of five. The first five patients 
were allocated to either the yoga or the control group by 
blinded assignment. Randomization revealed the order of 
assignment for the next five patients (i.e. three to yoga and 
two to control). This procedure was repeated until one 
group had 40 respondents at which point the remaining 
patients were systematically allocated to the other group.
All patients met the same research-nurse twice – first at 
baseline and finally after 12 weeks (within a two-week 
visit window after intervention) at the end of the study – to 
assess QoL and hemodynamic parameters. Both visits (at 
baseline and at end of study) were held in the morning in 
the same room at the hospital for both groups. There was 
no change in environment for both groups’ visits.
Medication treatments were collected from medical 
records at baseline and at the end of the study.
Ethics
All participants provided verbal and written informed con-
sent at baseline. The study was approved by the Ethics 
Committee of Stockholm, Sweden (DNR 2008/1983-
31/2), Clinical Trial Gov Id: NCT01789372. The investi-
gation conforms to the principles outlined in the Declaration 
of Helsinki.
Intervention
In this study we used a yoga form called Mediyoga (http://
mediyoga.com). This is a therapeutic form of yoga evolved 
from Kundalini yoga. It is a calm, meditative yoga based 
on deep breathing and is designed so that participants 
 
(if needed) may sit on a chair and exercise certain

movements. The yoga program was specifically designed 
for people with cardiac diseases; it includes movements 
that stretch the muscles in the chest, which facilitates deep 
breathing and relaxes the body. Each session started with 
deep breathing for 5–10 min followed by three movements 
(back flex, back roll and Sat Kriya) that included two 
breathing techniques, subsequent meditation (10 min) and 
relaxation (10 min). A detailed description of the yoga pro-
gram is available in the Supplementary Material Appendix. 
The intervention was performed under the instruction of an 
experienced yoga instructor. The instructor was not aware 
of changes in the standard medical therapy.
Participants performed yoga in group sessions once a 
week during the 12-week intervention period. Each yoga 
session took place in the hospital (physiotherapy clinic) 
and lasted one hour. Group session had a maximum of 10 
participants in each, who were also encouraged to prac-
tice yoga at home. To assist with self-instructed yoga, 
participants received a written program that included 
descriptions of movements together with a CD. The con-
trol group was instructed not to perform any yoga during 
the intervention period. Both groups received standard 
treatment including medication, cardio version and cath-
eter ablation.
Endpoints
The primary endpoint was difference in QoL after 12 
weeks of yoga between the groups and within the groups. 
The secondary endpoints were blood pressure and heart 
rate from baseline to the end of the study.
Quality of life assessments
Two generic health-related QoL questionnaire, Short-
Form Health Survey (SF-36)16,17 and a VAS-scale from 
EuroQoL-5D (EQ-5D)18,19 were used.
SF-36 is a standardized, validated and reliable health-
related QoL questionnaire16,17 which contains 36 ques-
tions frequently used in arrhythmia studies. These 
questions can be divided into eight domains and two 
dimensions: physical health and mental health. The two 
dimensions are analysed into scores 0-100 where 100 is 
the best possible state of QoL.
EQ-5D Visual Analogue Scale (VAS) is a part of EQ-5D 
and is also a standardized, validated and reliable scale.18,19 
This consists of a scale between 0–100 where 100 is the 
best possible state of QoL.
The participants filled in the health related forms, SF-36 
and EQ-5D VAS-scale at inclusion and at end of the study.
Haemodynamic assessments
Systolic and diastolic blood pressure were measured on 
both visits. After sitting and resting for five minutes, the 
blood pressure was measured in the same arm with a cali-
brated automated blood pressure meter (OMRON). Heart 
rate was also measured during a one-minute rest period.
Statistical analysis
The variables in this study have been processed statisti-
cally using the data analysis program, PASW Statistics 
version 19. Student’s t-test (paired t-test) was used between 
the groups (yoga and control group) for blood pressure and 
heart rate. Mann–Whitney U test was used in the analysis 
of QoL questionnaire SF-36 and EQ-5D VAS-scale and the 
Wilcoxon Signed Ranks test was used for within-group 
analyses. After controlling for outliers, an analysis of 
covariance (ANCOVA) was made to test if there were any 
significance differences in demographic data between the 
groups. The covariates we analysed were age, gender, 
hypertension and stroke. Demographic data is presented 
with mean, standard deviation (SD) or median, range and 
percentage. A significance level of p<0.05 was chosen.
Results
In the yoga group there were 33 patients who completed the 
intervention. Seven patients (17.5%) – four men (10%) and 
three women (7.5%) – ceased to participating before the 
study period was completed. In the control group, 36 patients 
completed the study period; four male patients (10%) ceased 
to participate. Clinical characteristics – age and sex between 
the two groups – are shown in Table 1. There were no signifi-
cance differences between the yoga and the control group 
regarding age, gender, hypertension and stroke.
The use of medications is presented in Table 2. There 
was a trend of more use of antiarrhythmic medications and 
angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors in the 
control group, but no significant changes in medication 
occurred over time. During the study period, two (6%) and 
three (8%) patients performed an ablation in the yoga and 
control group respectively. All completed the study. On 
average the participants in the yoga group performed 10 
yoga sessions (range 8–12) at the hospital. At the end of the 
study participants reported any yoga they may have con-
ducted at home to the research nurse. At-home yoga was 
conducted at a median of two (range 1–4) sessions a week.
QoL
At baseline the yoga group estimated significantly lower 
QoL in EQ-5D VAS-scale as well as SF-36 mental health 
scores compared to the control group, but no significant 
differences were observed between the groups regarding 
SF-36 physiological health scores (Table 3).
After 12 weeks the patients’ estimated scores in 
EQ-5D VAS-scale had increased significantly (p<0.001) 
in the yoga group whereas the control group 
 60

experienced no change (p=0.622). The same pattern was 
seen in the estimated SF-36 mental health scores, with 
significant improvement in the yoga group (p<0.001) 
during the study that was not seen in the control group 
(p=0.782).
In the subscales of physical health in SF-36 scores, no 
significant difference was seen between or within the 
groups at the end of the study.
Haemodynamic assessments
There were two different patients, one at baseline and 
one at the end of the study, which had atrial fibrillation 
according to ECG. At baseline there were no differences 
between the two groups in heart rate or systolic and 
diastolic blood pressures. After 12 weeks of yoga, heart 
rates were significantly lower in the yoga group com-
pared with the control group (p=0.024) as well as sys-
tolic (p=0.033) and diastolic (p<0.001) blood pressures 
(Table 4).
Discussion
This is a pilot study. To our knowledge this is one of the 
largest randomized studies evaluating the effect of yoga in 
patients with PAF. Our results show that yoga significantly

improves QoL and that their increased comfort allows 
them to more easily tolerate their conditions. Decreasing 
blood pressure and resting heart rate may give patients a 
feeling of security. Decreasing suffering and helping 
patients to feel safe are critical elements of nurses’ roles as 
regards their patients.20
When patients with atrial fibrillation are compared with 
healthy controls, the general population and patients with 
coronary heart disease in sinus rhythm, they present with 
an impaired QoL.4 One of the most important treatment 
goals in atrial fibrillation is to reduce symptoms and 
improve QoL.21 The result of our study is that a 12-week 
yoga program can improve QoL in patients with PAF. This 
has also been reported by previous studies that indicated 
that yoga can contribute to patients’ wellbeing and reduce 
episodes of atrial fibrillation.22 Yoga has also been reported 
to increase self-esteem in social QoL11 and improve QoL 
in individuals with congestive heart failure.10 A recent 
study also reported data that yoga can improve the QoL, 
anxiety and depression in patients with PAF.22 Our results 
may bring access to a complementary treatment that allows 
patients with PAF to achieve a healthier life, improve their 
sociability and increase their QoL.
Although we performed a randomized study, the two 
groups were not completely balanced; the yoga group esti-
mated a lower QoL regarding EQ5D VAS-scale and SF-36 
mental health at baseline. In our study we had relatively 
more women and patients with a previous stroke/transitory 
ischaemic attack (TIA) in the yoga group and in earlier 
studies women with PAF estimate poorer QoL than men23,24 
and patients who have suffered a stroke estimate poorer 
QoL than the general population.25 This asymmetry could 
influence our results at baseline.
QoL can be difficult to measure given the various fac-
tors that may impact it. Factors that can contribute to 
QoL may occur at different times, which can affect QoL 
measurements.26 The measurements were equal for both 
groups in this study and therefore should have no influ-
ence on the results.
In our study heart rate as well as systolic and diastolic 
blood pressure was significantly lower in the yoga group 
compared to the control group, in which no changes in 
blood pressure were observed. This effect on blood pres-
sure and heart rate may also be another explanation to 
improved 
QoL 
among 
patients 
practicing 
yoga. 
Hypertension is an important risk factor for atrial fibrilla-
tion related complications. Many of these patients have 
insufficiently regulated blood pressure, which may cause 
unnecessary cardiovascular events2,27 including the devel-
opment of PAF and recurrent atrial fibrillation.8 Decreasing 
blood pressure may lead to a reduced risk for bleeding in 
treatment with anticoagulants. Studies with yoga describe 
similar effects on blood pressure as we do.11,12 Literature 
recommends slow deep breathing to lower blood pres-
sure,14 and we used a yoga form based on slow deep 
breathing. It seems that patients who have increased heart 
rate and blood pressure may have a deteriorated QoL.27,28
At the same time, high heart rates are relatively com-
mon and may lead to pronounced symptoms and eventu-
ally development of a tachycardiomyopathy.29 Decreasing 
blood pressure and heart rate with yoga appears to reduce 
complications with other medical conditions such as stroke 
and heart failure in patients with PAF, although this 
requires more careful examination.
It is becoming more common for patients with arrhyth-
mia to use complementary alternative medicine, including 
yoga.30 It is therefore becoming more and more significant 
to evaluate the effects of yoga in providing safe treatments 
for those patients.
It is important to improve QoL in patients with PAF 
as well as to decrease their mortality and hospitalisa-
tion.31 During our study the yoga group substantially 
improved their estimated QoL according to EQ-5D 
VAS-scale and SF-36 mental health, in contrast to the 
control group in which no improvement was seen. One 
important reason for this is that yoga may give patients 
with PAF a method to gain some self-control over their 
symptoms. As the incidence and cost of PAF treatment 
increases in society, yoga may be a complementary 
treatment strategy to improve PAF care.
Limitations
Although this is one of the largest randomized study evalu-
ating yoga in PAF, it included a rather small number of 
included subjects. That may have contributed largely to the 
differences between the study groups at baseline. A larger 
study would be needed to confirm the effects of yoga in 
Table 4. Haemodynamic assessments.

patients with PAF. We also included patients with PAF 
irrespective of their symptoms. The effect may be more 
pronounced if the study only includes patients with a 
symptomatic arrhythmia. Episodes of atrial fibrillation 
may lower the estimated QoL. The numbers of episodes of 
atrial fibrillation and symptoms were not reported in this 
study. This exclusion can influence the result. The partici-
pants in the intervention group may have had more epi-
sodes of atrial fibrillation, and those episodes could have 
produced to more symptoms in the intervention group than 
were observed in the control group. This may influence the 
results in QoL assessments at baseline.
Another limitation of this randomized study is that the 
group therapy of yoga can have a placebo effect and 
increase QoL.
SF-36 and EQ-5D VAS-scale are general quality of life 
questionnaires and include no questions about symptoms. 
A more specific form to evaluate QoL for patients with 
PAF would be more appropriate.
Although we found good effects on physical markers 
in the yoga group, such as decreased heart rate and 
blood pressure, our understanding of this positive 
effects may benefit to further research. The further 
research should, for example, also include bigger sam-
ple size, comparing different interventions (for example 
relaxation technique) and measuring the episodes of 
atrial fibrillation over time.
Conclusion
Yoga with light movements and deep breathing may lead 
to improved QoL, lower blood pressure and decreased 
heart rate in patients with PAF compared to a control group 
not performing yoga. Yoga could be a complementary 
treatment method to standard therapy.
Implications for practice
•
•
This is the largest randomized study with 
yoga and PAF.
•
•
Yoga with light movements and deep breath-
ing leads to improved QoL, lower blood pres-
sure and heart rate in patients with PAF 
compared with a control group.
•
•
The yoga program we used in this study is suit-
able for patients with PAF as it involves move-
ments, deep breathing and meditation suitable 
for practice at any age. It uses the same type of 
techniques as other yoga forms: long deep 
breaths, various movements and meditation.
•
•
We believe that this form of yoga could be 
implemented due to its simplicity and can be 
carried out generally in patients with PAF.
•
•
Yoga can be a complementary treatment 
method to standard therapy.
