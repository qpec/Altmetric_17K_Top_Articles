Allogeneic hematopoietic cell transplantation (HCT) is a potentially curative treatment for patients with hematological
malignancies. However, is associated with substantial rates of morbidity and mortality. We and others have shown that malglycemia
is associated with adverse transplant outcome. Therefore, improving glycemic control may improve transplant outcome. In this
prospective study we evaluated the feasibility of using Glucommander (a Computer-Guided Glucose Management System; CGGM)
in order to achieve improved glucose control in hospitalized HCT patients. Nineteen adult patients contributed 21 separate
instances on CGGM. Patients were on CGGM for a median of 43 h. Median initial blood glucose (BG) on CGGM was 244 mg/dL, and
patients on 20 study instances reached the study BG target of 100–140 mg/dL after a median of 6 h. After BG reached the target
range, the median average BG level per patient was 124 mg/dL. Six patients had a total of 10 events of BG o70 mg/dL (0.9% of BG
measurements), and no patients experienced BG level o40 mg/dL. The total estimated duration of BG o70 mg/dL was 3 h (0.2%
of the total CGGM time). In conclusion, our study demonstrates that stringent BG control in HCT patients using CGGM is feasible.

INTRODUCTION
Hyperglycemia is associated with an increased risk of death
among patients with both chronic and acute illnesses.1–3 Recently,
efforts
have
been
made
to
control
hyperglycemia
during
hospitalization, but results from clinical trials and retrospective
analyses have demonstrated inconsistent outcomes associated
with intensive insulin therapy.4–9,10–12 There is also evidence
that severe hypoglycemia (glucose o40 mg/dL) in hospitalized
patients
may
have
a
detrimental
effect
on
outcomes,
including cardiac arrest, seizures, hypoglycemia-induced coma
and mortality,5,13–17 thus limiting the efforts for meticulous
glucose control in the hospital. In addition, recent evidence also
suggests that glucose variability can be detrimental and increase
mortality risk in hospitalized patients.18–21
Allogeneic hematopoietic cell transplantation (HCT) is the only
potential curative treatment for patients with high-risk hemato-
logical malignancies. However, HCT continues to be associated
with substantial rates of non-relapse mortality (NRM) (3-year NRM
of 20–30%).22,23 Our team has previously shown that malglycemia
(hyperglycemia, hypoglycemia or increased glycemic variability)
was associated with increased day–200 NRM, overall mortality and
infection rate. Our earlier study demonstrated that glucose values
above 200 mg/dL were associated with twofold or more increase
in NRM, compared with BG values between 101 and 150 mg/dL.24
Similarly, Fuji et al.25 demonstrated an association between
hyperglycemia and increased risk of organ dysfunction, grade II–
IV acute GvHD and NRM in adult patients treated by myeloablative
allogeneic HCT, and Gebremedhin et al.26 demonstrated that
severe hyperglycemia immediately after allogeneic HCT was
predictive of acute GvHD. There is, therefore, interest in improving
glycemic control in the hope of improving transplant outcome.
Fuji et al. previously conducted an intensive glucose control study
after HCT. Although the result was feasible, glucose control in
that study was still unsatisfactory.27 Computer-Guided Glucose
Management (CGGM) may be a mechanism through which
intensive glucose control can be attained. In this prospective
study we evaluated the feasibility of using Glucommander 1.0
(an FDA (Food and Drug Administration)-cleared CGGM) in order
to achieve improved glucose control in hospitalized HCT patients.
Based on the findings of our prior study24 the primary objective of
this study was to examine the ability of CGGM algorithm to control
glucose level within target range of 100–140 mg/dL.
SUBJECTS AND METHODS
Patients
Patients 18 years of age and older who underwent allogeneic HCT at the
FHCRC (Fred Hutchinson Cancer Research Center), Seattle, and required
insulin therapy due to known history of type 2 diabetes, two episodes of
blood glucose (BG) level above 180 mg/dL or one BG level above
250 mg/dL were eligible for the study. Exclusion criteria for participation
were critically ill patients (Intensive Care Unit status), terminally ill patients,
Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group43 and diagnosis of type 1 diabetes
mellitus.
The
study
received
approval
by
the
FHCRC
Institutional
Review Board.
Nineteen adult patients were treated on the study. Two of those patients
were treated on the study during two separate hospitalizations, resulting in
a total of 21 separate instances on CGGM.

 BG monitoring and insulin treatment
BG measurements were obtained by bedside capillary glucose finger stick
or venous whole blood, using Roche Accu-Chek Inform glucose meter.
Insulin was given as continuous IV infusion. BG levels were entered
manually into the Glucommander Software, which calculated the insulin
dose for the next period, and calculated the time for the next BG
measurement.
Changes
to
the
insulin
infusion
doses
were
made
manually by the nursing staff, according to the Glucommander software
recommendations.
Glucommander Software
Glucommander (Glytec, Waltham, MA, USA) is an FDA-cleared CGGM
system.28 Using a physician-selected glucose target range and a weight-
based
multiplier,
the
computer-based
algorithm
calculates
and
recommends an insulin infusion rate and interval to next BG measurement.
To initiate the system a desired BG target, patient’s weight and BG value
are manually entered by a health-care provider, and the initial insulin
infusion rate and the time for the next BG measurement are calculated by
the software. The interval for BG measurements is between 20 and 120 min
based on the rate of glucose level change. The interval of BG checks
recommended by Glucommander is consistent with the standard of care
for insulin infusion, typically every 60 min. Interval is extended to every
120 min if patient is within target range for a specified time, or shortened
to every 20 min based on the rate of change of BG level. The system
continues recommending the IV insulin infusion rate until discontinued by
the health-care provider.
Statistical analysis
Box and whisker plots were used to summarize times to and in different BG
ranges as well as the average BG while in those ranges. The box’s vertical
lines represent quartiles and the whiskers extend to the furthest data point
within 1.5 times the inner quartile range. Times to the specified BG range
were calculated as the number of hours from initiation of CGGM to the first
measurement within that range. Times in the BG ranges were calculated by
assuming a linear relationship between any two values and imputing the
time a threshold was crossed. Two of the 19 study participants contributed
two separate instances on CGGM, their data were treated as independent
for these descriptive analyses, resulting in 21 separate study instances.
Simple linear regression and LOESS smoothing were used to highlight
trends in the data. Analyses were completed with the statistical computing
language R v3.2.229 and the ggplot2 graphics package v1.0.1.30
RESULTS
Patient characteristics
Nineteen adult patients (13 male), contributed 21 separate
instances on CGGM at a median of 69 days (range, 9–481 days)
after allogeneic HCT. Median age at study enrollment was 52 years
(range, 22–73 years). Patients on 19 of the 21 study instances were
on systemic steroids for treatment of GvHD (n = 18) or diffuse
alveolar hemorrhage (n = 1), with median daily prednisone dose of
140 mg (range, 10–200 mg). Patients on six study instances had
documented active infection. Total parental nutrition was given to
patients on 10 out of 21 study instances. Three patients had a
prior history of type 2 diabetes. Characteristics of patients are
presented in Table 1.
Patients remained on CGGM for a median of 43 h (range,
10–195 h) for a total of 1272 h. Patients were removed from CGGM
due to: transition from IV insulin to SC insulin (n = 9), patient
request (n = 5), discharge (n = 4), other (n = 3).
Glucose control
Median BG at initiation of CGGM, defined as the first BG reading
while on CGGM, was 244 mg/dL (range, 124–421). Patients on 20
of the 21 study instances reached the study BG target of 100–
140 mg/dL after a median of 6 h (range, 0–16.2 h) (Figure 1a).
There was one instance where the initial BG on CGGM was within
100–140 mg/dL range, as the patient was on standard insulin
therapy prior to initiation of CGGM. Thus, for this patient, it took
zero hours to reach the target range. The one patient who did not
reach the study BG target (study instance no. 21, Figure 4) entered
the CGGM with BG level of 421 mg/dL, reached a BG level of
157 mg/dL, and was removed from study after 11.5 h due to
patient request. After BG reached the study target range (100–
140 mg/dL), the median average BG level per patient was 124 mg/
dL (range of 118–167). All patients reached a conventional BG
range of 80–180 mg/dL at a median time of 3.8 h (range, 0–10.5 h)
(Figure 1a).
Patients had wide variability in glucose level before and after
CGGM, while maintaining targeted BG level (100–140 mg/dL) in
61% of the time while on CGGM (Figure 2). For comparison,
patients were within target range only 0.58% of the time during
the last 24 h prior to initiation of CGGM and 20.95% of the time in
the 24 h after completion of CGGM.
After reaching the target range, patients spent a median of 3.8 h
under 100 mg/dL and 10.2 h over 140 mg/dL, compared with
26.2 h within the 100–140 mg/dL range (Figure 1b). Stringent
glucose control (100–140 mg/dL) was achieved with only 10
documented hypoglycemic episodes (BG o70 mg/dL; range,
51–67 mg/dL) (0.9% of BG measurements), experienced by six
patients (Figure 1c). All six patients who developed hypoglycemia
had GvHD and were treated with systemic glucocorticoids at an
average dose of 105 mg/day and three patients also had active
infections. With the limitation of timing of bedside BG measure-
ments by nursing staff, the estimated median duration of
hypoglycemic episodes was 17 min (range, 6–36 min). The total
estimated duration of BG o70 mg/dL for the entire study cohort
was 3 h (0.2% of the total time patients were monitored on CGGM)
(Figure 1c). No severe hypoglycemic episodes (BG o40 mg/dL)
were detected.

 Patients on 13 of the 21 study instances remained on CGGM for
424 h after reaching the target range. Median BG per patient was
127 mg/dL (range, 119–167 mg/dL) in the first 24 h after reaching
the target, and was 121 mg/dL (range, 112–138 mg/dL) thereafter
(Figure 1d). Our data suggest a trend for better BG control the
longer the patient remained on CGGM (Figure 3a), but with no
difference in BG variability (Figure 3b).
Figure 4 demonstrates BG levels of all patients while on CGGM.
Insulin doses required to maintain tight glucose control while
on CGGM were variable (between 0 and 59.6 u/h), but were higher
than the insulin doses used in the 24 h before or after CGGM.
Table 2 summarizes the range of insulin doses for all patients
while on CGGM and in the 24 h before and after CGGM.
DISCUSSION
Several studies have evaluated the effect of BG levels on
hospitalized patients with emerging evidence that not only
hyperglycemia, but also hypoglycemia and variable glucose level
may have a negative effect on outcome.1,2,5,8,14–16,18–20,31–36 Our
team and others have previously demonstrated the association
between
malglycemia
(hyperglycemia,
hypoglycemia
and
increased glycemic variability) and increased NRM and infections
in HCT patients.24–26 In addition, adverse clinical consequences of
hyperglycemia from total parenteral nutrition exposure during
HCT were reported.37 These findings raised the hypothesis that
stringent glycemic control with prevention of hypoglycemia and
glucose variability may improve transplant outcome. However, as
demonstrated by the NICE SUGAR study, intensive glucose control
may increase the risk of severe hypoglycemia.35 Thus, a novel
strategy is required to obtain glucose level within a stringent
range while minimizing hypoglycemia. Using Glucommander it
was recently shown that for patients without diabetes, complica-
tions during coronary artery grafting were less, maintaining
glucose level between 100 and 140 mg/dL versus level of
141–180 mg/dL.12 As the first step to prospectively evaluate the
effect of this desired degree of glucose control in the HCT setting,
we evaluated the feasibility of obtaining near normoglycemia in
HCT patients using a CGGM. Despite the small number of patients
enrolled on the study, we demonstrated that a narrow range of
glucose levels between 100 and 140 mg/dL was attained 61% of
the time while on CGGM, with only 10 episodes (0.9% of BG
measurements and 0.2% of total time on study) of BG lower than
70 mg/dL and with no episodes of BG lower than 40 mg/dL. This
rate is significantly lower compared with other protocols. For
example, in the NICE SUGAR study 6.9% of patients in the
intensive therapy group had severe hypoglycemia defined as a
glucose level below 40 mg/dL.38 Our data, in a more difficult
population, are comparable to other CGGM data, in which, among
over 5000 insulin runs (over 120 000 h) 0.6% of values were found
to be o50 mg/dL.28 Hypoglycemia will always remain a limiting
factor of insulin therapy, but the frequency of hypoglycemia in our
study is minimal as we documented no levels below 50 mg/dL
and only 0.9% below 70 mg/dL.
GvHD produces a massive inflammatory response,39 which may
lead to insulin resistance.40 Treatment with glucocorticoids, while
effective in reducing inflammatory activation, will result in more
insulin resistance and for many, hyperglycemia, as demonstrated
by Pidala et al.41 There are further theoretical concerns that
the combination of hyperglycemia and hyperinsulinemia (either
endogenous or exogenous) may be maladaptive as this scenario
has been shown to result in additional inflammation.42 On the

 other hand, when enough insulin is provided to control glycemia,
inflammation is actually suppressed.43 As recently reviewed by
Fuji et al. hyperglycemia causes not only impaired immune
function and elevation of proinflammatory cytokines, but also
causes problems with other tissues, such as endothelial dysfunc-
tion, catabolism of muscle and fat and procoagulation, all of which
may be relevant in patients after allogeneic HSCT.44 Given our
original observations of increased NRM and mortality associated
with malglycemia,24 we hypothesized that providing enough IV
insulin to meticulously control glucose levels during GvHD could
add to the anti-inflammatory stimulus of the glucocorticoids and
impact HCT outcomes. The primary objective of our study was to
evaluate if the degree of glycemic control required in this situation
was possible, and the results suggest it is indeed possible,
although inflammatory cytokines were not measured.
A
limitation
of
our
study
was
the
need
for
frequent
(approximately once every hour) BG measurements to be entered
to the CGGM software to calculate the recommended insulin
dose. The frequent BG measurements by finger stick caused
inconvenience to patients and nursing staff, but were essential to
adjust the insulin dosing in order to maintain glucose levels within
the target range. Furthermore, current
standard IV insulin
protocols also require hourly BG testing.45,46 While continuous
glucose monitoring, either SC or intravascular are not current
options in the inpatient setting, if these tools ever become
available the ability to control glycemia should become less
burdensome.47–51 Additional limitations of our study are the
small cohort and the lack of a control arm. However this is a
feasibility study, which we hope will set the stage for a larger
randomized trial.
In conclusion, our study demonstrates that despite high doses
of steroids, total parenteral nutrition, and unpredictable oral
intake, stringent BG control without frequent hypoglycemia or
high glycemic variability was achieved by using CGGM. Future
studies are needed to assess the practicality of using CGGM in a
multi-center setting in addition to measurement of various
inflammatory markers. The ultimate goal of these studies will be
to perform a larger randomized controlled trial to evaluate the
impact of improved glycemic control on transplant outcome.
