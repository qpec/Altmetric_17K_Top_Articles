US schools increasingly report body mass index (BMI) to students
and their parents in annual fitness “report cards.” We obtained
3,592,026 BMI reports for New York City public school students
for 2007–2012. We focus on female students whose BMI puts them
close to their age-specific cutoff for categorization as overweight.
Overweight students are notified that their BMI “falls outside a
healthy weight” and they should review their BMI with a health
care provider. Using a regression discontinuity design, we compare
those classified as overweight but near to the overweight cutoff to
those whose BMI narrowly earned them a “healthy” BMI grouping.
We find that overweight categorization generates small impacts on
girls’ subsequent BMI and weight. Whereas presumably an intent of
BMI report cards was to slow BMI growth among heavier students,
BMIs and weights did not decline relative to healthy peers when
assessed the following academic year. Our results speak to the dis-
crete categorization as overweight for girls with BMIs near the over-
weight cutoff, not to the overall effect of BMI reporting in New
York City.

O
besity often emerges early in childhood. Among 7,738 US
children, eighth graders were four times as likely to be
obese if they were overweight in kindergarten (1). Parents can be
surprisingly uninformed about overweight and obesity status of
their children. Sixty-one percent of parents in San Diego cor-
rectly identified whether their child was overweight (2). “Obliv-
iobesity” among US parents may be growing over time (3, 4). On
the other hand, US school districts and states have begun dis-
tributing annual fitness and body mass index (BMI) “report
cards” to students and parents. Such personalized informational
interventions have appeal in economics because they can be rel-
atively inexpensive, particularly compared with traditional pro-
grams that include the delivery of costly health services. As
individual dietary and exercise habits are being established during
childhood, it has been argued that obesity surveillance, reporting,
and prevention interventions should likewise begin early.
Opponents of BMI reporting argue that informing children
that they are “fat” can be stigmatizing, hurt their self-esteem, and
even encourage bullying. Such unintended reactions may prompt
a cascade of behavioral responses that do not improve health (5).
Additionally, BMI (weight divided by height squared) is rou-
tinely criticized as a metric of fitness. Whether BMI report cards
are an effective tool for helping to reduce obesity is not obvious a
priori. Large-scale empirical analyses are now feasible thanks to
expanded collection of BMI data, data generated for the ad-
ministrative purpose of issuing BMI report cards.
Fitnessgrams were adopted by New York City’s public schools in
2007–2008, reporting each student’s BMI alongside categorical
BMI designations. Specifically, each student’s BMI is classified and
reported to be “underweight,” “healthy,” “overweight,” or “obese.”
Categorizations are assigned using the students’ most recently
recorded BMI vis à vis the age- and sex-specific BMI cutoffs from
the Centers for Disease Control (CDC). By these national criteria
(based on 1970s National Health and Nutrition Examination
Survey data), over one-third of New York City public school
students are either overweight or obese. Report cards for NYC
students with an overweight BMI state, “Your BMI falls outside
of a healthy weight; please review your BMI with a health
care provider.”
Hard copy Fitnessgram reports are distributed to students in
school in May. Here, we consider the discontinuous assignment
of the overweight label and its associated health recommenda-
tions. As we will argue below, categorization helps isolate the
causal effect of BMI information on subsequent BMI and weight.
Methods
Research Design. We compare those narrowly designated as overweight to
those narrowly designated as having a healthy BMI. For students who were
particularly close to the overweight threshold, overweight categorization has
an arbitrary component because individual control over small movements in
the recorded BMI is imperfect. Reasons for this imperfect “local” control
include: day-to-day variation in weight; diurnal variation in weight; mea-
surement error in recorded height; differences in weight when measured
across different scales, and students not knowing in advance when the in-
school Fitnessgram BMI assessment will occur. Additionally, whereas the
adult BMI cutoffs for overweight (25) and obese (30) are widely known,
cutoffs among children are not because they change with each age in
months and seldom fall on round numbers. For example, an 11-y-old girl
would be classified as overweight if her BMI exceeded 20.19667, whereas
1 mo later her threshold would be 20.26514 (i.e., the overweight threshold
for a girl 11 y and 1 mo old). Clearly students have some degree of control
over their recorded BMI. Our identifying assumption is that control over the
exact BMI, as recorded for Fitnessgram assessment, is short of perfect. That
said, we allow for a continuous relationship between baseline and
subsequent BMI, an underlying process which we do not ascribe to
the categorization.
Imprecise control over BMI would imply that observed and unobserved
predetermined characteristics have continuous distributions in baseline BMI.
Significance
One third of US children are overweight. Childhood obesity
is strongly associated with academic performance, predicts
obesity in adulthood, and may be easier to modify than adult
weight. Parents who are unaware their children are overweight
may impede healthier weight ranges. We consider an in-
formational intervention of New York City’s obesity report cards
using a regression discontinuity design framework. To a surpris-
ing degree, discontinuous assignment rules are commonplace in
allocating program services and shaping clinical care decisions by
health care providers. Regression discontinuity designs offer a
relatively untapped methodological approach for isolating causal
effects, particularly as they relate to health.

 That is, if individuals are unable to precisely sort on either side of the assigned
threshold, treatment is essentially randomly assigned around the cutoff (6).
As a consequence, the discontinuity in the dependent variable at the
threshold captures the causal effect of the overweight label. To empirically
test imprecise control over BMI, we examine whether the density of baseline
BMI is continuous at the cutoff. If individuals can precisely control their BMI
so as to receive the healthy label, we might expect to see “too many” stu-
dents just below the cutoff. We examine the density and confirm that ob-
servations are not “heaped” near the threshold. Moreover, we can also
evaluate whether BMI control appears imperfect by assessing whether in-
dividuals are similar in observable characteristics as the distance from the
threshold goes to zero. Although it is impossible to test whether their un-
observable factors jump at the threshold (e.g., the unobserved, individual
BMI progression before entry into our panel data), incomplete control of
recorded BMI described above would likewise lead such unobservables to be
continuous across the threshold. This is not to suggest we think key unob-
servables are uncorrelated with BMI. Rather, the key issue is whether such
factors are discontinuous at the threshold.
Data Access and Study Population. New York City’s Department of Education
(NYCDOE) has a standardized application procedure through which re-
searchers request access to deidentified microdata. For more information,
see schools.nyc.gov/Accountability/data/DataRequests.htm. Study and data
handling procedures were approved by both the New York University and
NYCDOE Institutional Review Boards. No individual consent was required for
this analysis of deidentified administrative data.
For the 2007–2008 to 2011–2012 academic years, we obtained 3,692,026
BMI measurements on New York City public school students. Records for
individual students are linked longitudinally using a unique, encrypted stu-
dent identifier. Here, we focus on how female students’ subsequent BMI and
weight respond to an overweight designation in the previous academic year.
We restrict estimation to the subsample of girls whose baseline BMI fell
within 0.5 SDs (roughly 2 BMI units) of the overweight threshold; 442,408
records met these selection criteria. As a consequence of imprecise BMI
control, we expect (and indeed find) the baseline characteristics of the
sample just above and below their respective overweight threshold to be
similar after allowing for a BMI trend. We test whether the results are sensitive
to choices of bandwidth other than 0.5 SDs in Alternative Bandwidths below.
Econometric Model. We estimate the effect of the overweight label on future
BMI and weight in a regression discontinuity design (RDD) framework:
BMIia,t+1 = β0 + β1 · overweightiat + fðBMIiat − caÞ +
ϕa + ϕa · fðBMIiat − caÞ + eiat,
where β1 is the coefficient of interest. Overweightiat equals 1 when the BMI
is greater than the overweight threshold for student i with age in months a
in year t, and 0 otherwise. We control for a linear function fð · Þ of the
baseline BMI in year t: BMIiat, centered at zero for the relevant age-specific
cutoff ca. We allow for the slopes to vary across the threshold by including
the interaction term between ðBMIiat − caÞ and overweightiat. Specifically,
fðBMIiat − caÞ = δ1 · ðBMIiat − caÞ + δ2 · ðBMIiat − caÞ · overweightiat.
Thus, we do control for the (positive) correlation between baseline BMI
and subsequent BMI. This accounts for a potential difference in the growth
rates between girls below and above the threshold. Because our sample
consists of girls of all ages in grades K–11 in the baseline year, we additionally
control for age in months fixed effects ϕa. Overweight assignment is defined
using the 85th percentile for 1970s US children of the same age and sex.
Thus, we compare girls just below the overweight threshold within the same
age in months group to those just above. We also flexibly allow for the
slopes in BMI to vary for each age by including the interaction terms be-
tween ϕa and fðBMIiat − caÞ. We additionally examine weightia,t+1 as a de-
pendent variable. In the tables, we report the estimated β1 s and their
confidence intervals.
Results
We find small effects of being labeled overweight in New York
City schools on female students’ subsequent BMI and weight.
These impact estimates are precise, ruling out nearly all “beneficial”
effects of being classified as overweight on subsequent BMI and
weight. The results are similar when we examine the effects of
being classified as obese. We perform an identical analysis for
males, and do not find any effects.
These findings are summarized in Table 1 below. Each row
reports estimates from a separate regression of the dependent
variable on the overweight categorization controlling for baseline

 BMI and age in months. Being labeled as overweight has little
and, if anything, a small positive effect on next year’s BMI
[an increase of 0.03 BMI units; 95% confidence interval (CI),
0.002–0.054; P value = 0.04 in row 1] and next year’s weight (an
increase of 0.17 lb.; 95% CI, 0.002–0.336; P value = 0.05 in row 2).
This suggests that the overweight label has no beneficial effects
compared with assignment with the healthy label (among students
with very similar baseline BMIs).
The subsequent rows of Table 1 confirm that baseline char-
acteristics are not statistically different across the overweight
threshold. This is consistent with our identifying assumption that
individuals are incapable of precisely manipulating their BMI
around the cutoff. Thus, focusing empirical comparisons on
those just below and just above the threshold furnishes a “nat-
ural experiment” that helps balance the other determinants and
correlates of BMI.
In additional analyses, we consider the subgroup of girls who
had not previously been notified they were overweight by Fit-
nessgram. For them, overweight categorization was potentially
more salient. Being newly categorized as overweight indeed has a
larger impact on subsequent BMI (roughly double the average
effect reported in Table 1). Still, the effect magnitude remains
modest: a 0.07 BMI unit increase on a mean of roughly 20 (95%
CI, 0.001–0.136; P = 0.05). Second, we consider heterogeneity by
grade and find that the oldest children in our sample––girls sent
report cards at the end of their junior year––show the largest
response. For seniors, we estimate BMI increased 0.27 units (on
a mean of 23.6; 95% CI, 0.08–0.46; P = 0.005) and weight in-
creased 1.35 lb. (on a mean of 136.3 lb.; 95% CI, 0.11–2.60; P =
0.03) due to overweight labeling at the end of the junior year.
Finally, we examine whether the overweight label affects sub-
sequent academic performance (measured by the State Mathe-
matics and English Language Arts test scores) of female students,
but find no effects on these performance measures.
Alternative Bandwidths. We consider whether our results are
sensitive to the choice of bandwidth, i.e., the size of the window
around the overweight cutoff used for analysis. If the window is
too narrow the estimates will be imprecise and control for the
running variable may be too flexible and “overfit.” On the other
hand, observations far from the threshold should not drive
discontinuity impact estimates. We reestimate our regression
equation using subsamples from 0.1 SD up to 1 SD from the
cutoff (in 0.1-SD increments). Fig. 1A plots the RDD estimates
for subsequent BMI along with the 95% confidence intervals for
each bandwidth. Fig. 1B plots the estimates for subsequent year’s
weight. The bandwidth used in Table 1 regressions is 0.5 SD. As
expected, estimates of β1 are imprecise for the smallest band-
widths. Estimates of β1 are surprisingly stable around 0.03 for
bandwidths from 0.3 SD to 0.8 SD. Estimates start to rise for
wider windows, potentially due to the bias arising from obser-
vations far away from the threshold. However, the point esti-
mates do not fall below 0.03 for all bandwidths, suggesting
throughout little or no beneficial effect of the overweight label.
Estimates for next year’s weight are generally imprecise, but the
point estimates are positive and stable for 0.2 SD and above.
Again, the estimates seem to increase when we use larger windows.
Placebo Percentiles. We do not expect effects at placebo BMI
percentiles that do not affect the categorizations and health
recommendations reported by Fitnessgram. In addition to the
85th percentile that determines overweight status, CDC reports
the following “closest” percentiles: the 50th, 75th, 90th, and 97th
[www.cdc.gov/growthcharts/html_charts/bmiagerev.htm]. As with
the actual overweight cutoff, these thresholds vary depending on
age in months and sex of the child. Just 31% of NYC students
are below the 50th percentile and 11% are above the 97th per-
centile, as CDC set these percentiles using data on US children
during the 1970s. We estimate our regression equation treating
each percentile as the “overweight cutoff.” Around each placebo
cutoff, we include observations within 0.5 SDs, i.e., the same
bandwidth as Table 1.
As expected, the placebo percentiles (50th, 75th, 90th, and
97th) do not yield statistically significant “effects” on subsequent
BMI. These nonresults suggest fð · Þ adequately captures under-
lying (continuous) BMI trends that can vary with baseline BMI.
When we instead consider weight as the outcome, again the 75th,
90th, and 97th percentiles generate estimates for β1 that are
smaller in absolute value and not statistically distinguishable
from zero. We do estimate a statistically significant false positive
for the 50th percentile on subsequent weight in pounds. With
a 95% CI, we expect 5% false positives/false negatives: we
obtained 1 in 8.
Discussion
To a surprising degree, discontinuous assignment rules are
common in allocating both program services, e.g. ref. 7, and
clinical care. Diabetes diagnoses are frequently based in part on
a threshold fasting glucose level and hypertension diagnoses
based on a threshold blood pressure level (8). Newborn infants
weighing below 1,500 g and thereby “very low birth weight” re-
ceive discontinuously more neonatal care and have lower infant
mortality than slightly heavier infants (9). Outside of economics,
analysis of the RDD offers a relatively untapped econometric
methodology for isolating causal effects, particularly as they
relate to health (10). Practice guidelines and even “rules of

 thumb” can constitute “silent adjudicators of clinical practice”
(8). At present, the discreteness inherent in both explicit guide-
lines and tacit rules of thumb are seldom leveraged by researchers,
despite the growing availability of administrative data on health.
Whereas in our application the overweight label is fully de-
termined by BMI for a given age and gender, this need not be the
case. As is more common, treatment assignment in RDD analyses
can be multifactorial, as in the above examples of diabetes and
hypertension diagnosis. Thus, valid RDDs can be either “sharp”
like ours or “fuzzy” (6).
Our BMI results suggest little or no benefit of overweight
notification among female students in New York City. These
results apply to the subpopulation of female public school stu-
dents in New York City with a high probability of being near the
overweight cutoff. The results are similar when we examine the
effects of obesity classification. We perform an identical analysis
for males, and do not find any significant effects. Unfortunately,
our data do not reveal to what extent the BMI report cards are
actually read and “processed” by the student and their parents.
In Mexico, an experimental distribution of BMI report cards did
improve parents’ knowledge of their child’s BMI, but likewise no
BMI reductions were detected (11). In New York, failure to read
and process BMI report cards could attenuate the effect of
categorization on subsequent BMI. However, to the extent that
we find significant effects, our findings suggest that indeed these
report cards were read by an important subpopulation.
We believe our RDD approach isolates the effect of having
BMI above versus below the categorization threshold. This effect
could be generated either by: (i) those below the threshold with
healthy weights responding to categorization by reducing their
weights, or (ii) those being labeled as overweight and advised to
consult with a health care provider increasing their weight (or
some combination of both responses). A priori, we find it more
likely that those classified as overweight responded, reinforced
by observation that the largest response is found among teen
girls, who might respond less constructively to the overweight
categorization absent additional supportive services. Future work
might consider whether electronic distribution of BMI report
cards yields comparably small impacts and whether the effect of
BMI labels likewise remains small.
