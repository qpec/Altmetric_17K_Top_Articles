 Although coccidioidomycosis in Arizona and California has 
been well-characterized, much remains unknown about its 
epidemiology in states where it is not highly endemic. We 
conducted enhanced surveillance in 14 such states in 2016 
by identifying cases according to the Council of State and 
Territorial Epidemiologists case definition and interviewing 
patients about their demographic characteristics, clinical 
features, and exposures. Among 186 patients, median time 
from seeking healthcare to diagnosis was 38 days (range 
1–1,654 days); 70% had another condition diagnosed be-
fore coccidioidomycosis testing occurred (of whom 83% 
were prescribed antibacterial medications); 43% were hos-
pitalized; and 29% had culture-positive coccidioidomycosis. 
Most (83%) patients from nonendemic states had traveled 
to a coccidioidomycosis-endemic area. Coccidioidomycosis 
can cause severe disease in residents of non–highly en-
demic states, a finding consistent with previous studies in 
Arizona, and less severe cases likely go undiagnosed or 
unreported. Improved coccidioidomycosis awareness in 
non–highly endemic areas is needed.
C
occidioidomycosis is a fungal infection caused by in-
halation of soil-dwelling Coccidioides spp. organisms. 
Symptomatic infection occurs in ≈40% of cases and usu-
ally presents as a self-limiting, influenza-like illness (also 
called Valley fever) after a 1–3-week incubation period. A 
small proportion of patients have life-threatening severe 
pulmonary or disseminated disease (1,2). In the United 
States, coccidioidomycosis is known to be endemic in the 
southwestern states, with hyperendemic foci in Arizona’s 
Sonoran Desert and California’s southern San Joaquin Val-
ley (3). The disease is also endemic in parts of Nevada, 
New Mexico, Utah, and Texas (3) but to a lesser extent. 
The actual endemic areas are likely broader than previously 
recognized; for example, Coccidioides was found in soil in 
south central Washington in 2013 and was implicated in 
locally acquired cases (4).
Coccidioidomycosis is reportable in 22 states. To 
meet the Council of State and Territorial Epidemiologists 
(CSTE) coccidioidomycosis case definition, cases must 
fulfill clinical and laboratory criteria (5). Approximately 
10,000 cases are reported each year through the National 
Notifiable Diseases Surveillance System (NNDSS), al-
though the number varies markedly by year. NNDSS cap-
tures basic demographic information about coccidioido-
mycosis cases, including the patients’ state and county of 
residence, age, sex, race, and ethnicity. Some states rou-
tinely collect additional information, such as travel history, 
that is not available in NNDSS. Approximately 65% of 
cases are reported from Arizona and ≈30% from Califor-
nia (6), and the epidemiology and burden of coccidioido-
mycosis in these states has been well described. Enhanced

 Enhanced Surveillance for Coccidioidomycosis
surveillance in Arizona during 2007–2008 showed sub-
stantial disease, including prolonged illness, and quantified 
the burden on the healthcare system, including an estimated 
$85 million total hospital charges in 2007 (7). In addition, 
patients who were aware of coccidioidomycosis before 
seeking healthcare were diagnosed sooner than those who 
did not know about the disease (7), suggesting that com-
munity awareness might prevent unnecessary diagnostic 
workup and antibacterial administration through earlier 
coccidioidomycosis diagnosis.
Although cases reported from states other than Arizona 
and California constitute a small proportion of total reported 
cases (4% in 2015), the number generally increased during 
the past decade, similar to the overall trend (6), indicating 
that coccidioidomycosis remains a public health problem on 
a national scale. However, features of cases in non–highly 
endemic areas have not been systematically described; pre-
vious studies of non–outbreak-associated cases are limited 
to single-state retrospective reviews of existing surveillance 
data or medical chart data (8–10). Therefore, we conducted 
enhanced surveillance in 14 states to better describe the epi-
demiology, diagnosis, and outcomes of these cases to help 
inform current routine surveillance practices and guide fu-
ture awareness and educational efforts in these areas.
Methods
During January 1–December 31, 2016, routine surveillance 
conducted in 14 states (Louisiana, Michigan, Minnesota, 
Missouri, Montana, Nevada, New Mexico, North Dakota, 
Ohio, Oregon, Pennsylvania, Utah, Wisconsin, and Wyo-
ming) identified coccidioidomycosis cases according to 
the CSTE case definition. State or local health department 
personnel contacted patients to participate in a voluntary 
telephone interview. A parent or guardian was interviewed 
for patients <18 years of age, and a relative or medical pro-
vider could complete the interview if the patient was inca-
pacitated or deceased. Using a standardized questionnaire, 
health department personnel asked patients about symp-
toms, healthcare-seeking behaviors, diagnosis, treatment, 
outcomes, underlying medical conditions, and travel his-
tory. They also collected information about laboratory tests 
used to diagnose coccidioidomycosis from electronic sur-
veillance databases. Some patients who met the CSTE case 
definition by laboratory criteria and symptoms but who 
clearly had a different diagnosis (such as histoplasmosis) or 
whose illnesses were not believed to be clinically consistent 
with coccidioidomycosis were not contacted for an inter-
view. We further excluded from the analysis interviewed 
case-patients with compelling evidence that their illness 
was caused by something other than coccidioidomycosis.
We classified Nevada, New Mexico, and Utah as low-
endemic because the risk for coccidioidomycosis is lower 
in those states than in Arizona and California. The 11 other 
states in this analysis were not known to be endemic for 
coccidioidomycosis and were considered nonendemic. We 
performed descriptive analysis and examined differences 
between cases in low- versus nonendemic states. We ana-
lyzed categorical variables by using χ2 or Fisher exact tests 
and used Wilcoxon rank-sum tests to compare continuous 
variables. A human subjects review by CDC determined 
this project to be nonresearch.
Results
Interviewed and Noninterviewed Patients
We identified 339 patients who met the CSTE coccidioi-
domycosis case definition. Of those, 144 (43%) were not 
interviewed. Forty-five (31%) of those patients were not in-
terviewed because a different illness etiology was identified 
or the illness was not believed to be clinically consistent 
with coccidioidomycosis; another 45 (31%) were unable to 
be contacted, 19 (13%) died, 14 (10%) refused, and no rea-
son was provided for the remaining 21 (15%). Among the 
45 noninterviewed patients with a different illness identi-
fied or an illness not clinically consistent with coccidioido-
mycosis, most had histoplasmosis (18 [40%]), 4 (9%) had 
aspergillosis, and the remainder had other or unspecified 
diagnoses. In addition, we excluded 9 interviewed patients 
thought not to have coccidioidomycosis based on labora-
tory test results and lack of travel to endemic areas, leaving 
186 interviewed patients in the final analysis. Therefore, 
16% (54/339) of all patients did not have coccidioidomy-
cosis, all but 1 from nonendemic states. Excluding all pa-
tients who did not have coccidioidomycosis, the response 
rate was 65% (186/285). Interviewed and noninterviewed 
patients were similar in age and sex.
Demographic Features and Underlying  
Medical Conditions
Sixty-four (34%) patients were from low-endemic states, 
and 122 (66%) were from nonendemic states; 109 (59%) 
patients were male, 89% were white, and the median age 
was 65 (range 7–91) years (Table 1). Patients in nonen-
demic states were less likely than those in low-endemic 
states to be Hispanic or Latino (4% vs. 25%; odds ratio 
[OR] 0.10, 95% CI 0.03–0.33), were older (median 67 vs. 
60 years; p = 0.01), and were more likely to have a yearly 
household income >$50,000 (61% vs. 41%; p = 0.043). 
The most common underlying medical conditions were 
diabetes (19%), heart disease (19%), and cancer (17%). Pa-
tients in nonendemic states were more likely to have heart 
disease than those in low-endemic states (24% vs. 9%; OR 
3.0, 95% CI 1.2–7.7). Thirty-six (19%) patients were con-
sidered to be immunosuppressed, 61 (34%) reported no 
underlying conditions, and 12 (7%) reported a previous 
history of coccidioidomycosis.

Symptoms, Healthcare Use, and Diagnosis
The most common symptoms were cough (65%), fatigue 
(62%), and shortness of breath (52%) (Table 2). Less than 
half of patients reported fever (n = 85 [46%]). Patients in 
nonendemic states were less likely than those in low-en-
demic states to report chest pain (25% vs. 53%; OR 0.30, 
95% CI 0.16–0.57), headache (24% vs. 41%; OR 0.46, 95% 
CI 0.24–0.87), joint pain (21% vs. 36%; OR 0.48, 95% CI 
0.25–0.94), or muscle pain (18% vs. 31%; OR 0.48, 95% 
CI 0.24–0.98). Patients first sought healthcare a median 
of 5.5 (range 0–488; interquartile range [IQR] 1–17) days 
after symptom onset. Most patients first sought care at a 
primary care office (36%) or emergency department (36%). 
Seventy percent of patients reported receiving a diagnosis 
of another illness before being tested for coccidioidomyco-
sis; among those, 63 (55%) said they received a pneumonia 
diagnosis, and 82 (83%) were prescribed antibacterial med-
ication. Patients in nonendemic states were more likely to 
have had a chest radiograph performed than those in low-
endemic states (94% vs. 73%; OR 5.4, 95% CI 2.1–13.9). 
More than half of patients (54%) visited a healthcare pro-
vider >3 times before being tested for coccidioidomycosis. 
Patients in nonendemic states were more likely than those 
in low-endemic states to ask for coccidioidomycosis test-
ing (23% vs. 10%; OR 2.8, 95% CI 1.1–7.2). Most patients 
were tested by a primary care physician (30%) or a pulmo-
nologist (26%). Median time between seeking healthcare 
and diagnosis was 38 (range 1–1,654, IQR 16–73) days. 
Patients in nonendemic states were more likely than those 
in low-endemic states to have a positive coccidioidomyco-
sis culture (36% vs. 16%; OR 3.0, 95% CI 1.4–6.5) or im-
munodiffusion test (36% vs. 16%; OR 3.0, 95% CI 1.4–6.5) 
and less likely to have a positive enzyme immunoassay test 
(20% vs. 69%; OR 0.12, 95% CI 0.06–0.23) (Table 3).
Treatment and Outcomes
Seventy-seven (43%) patients were hospitalized (median 
duration 8 [range 3–60] days). Among 115 (68%) patients 
prescribed antifungal medication, most (95 [83%]) were 
prescribed fluconazole. Patients in nonendemic states were

Travel to Known Endemic Areas
Overall, 124 (68%) patients (26 [41%] from low-endemic 
states and 98 [83%] from nonendemic states) traveled to 
Arizona, California, Nevada, New Mexico, Texas, Utah, 
Washington, Mexico, or Central or South America in the 4 
months before symptom onset (or before testing positive, if 
asymptomatic) (Figures 1, 2). Among 88 patients for whom 
information was available, median travel duration was 74.5 
(range 1–720) days. Five patients, all of whom traveled to 
Arizona, reported that a travel partner also had coccidioi-
domycosis. Among patients from nonendemic states, 59 
(48%) reported part-time residence in Arizona. Of the 
24 patients from nonendemic states who did not travel to 
known endemic areas in the 4 months before developing 
coccidioidomycosis, 16 reported ever traveling to those ar-
eas in their lifetime; 7 had incomplete travel histories be-
cause someone other than the patient was interviewed (n 
= 5) or because the patient did not complete the interview 
(n = 2). The remaining patient was a north-central Oregon 
resident with no underlying medical conditions whose only 
potentially relevant travel was to Mexico ≈12 years before 
symptom onset.
Knowledge of Coccidioidomycosis
Patients in nonendemic states were more likely than those 
in low-endemic states to know about their positive coccidi-
oidomycosis test results before the interview (90% vs. 59%; 
OR 6.1, 95% CI 2.8–13.4) and were more likely to have 
heard of coccidioidomycosis before their diagnosis (57% 
vs. 40%; OR 2.0, 95% CI 1.04–3.7). Among patients who 
knew about coccidioidomycosis before diagnosis, 73% first 
heard about it from a family member, friend, or co-worker.
Discussion
These enhanced surveillance data provide much-needed 
insight into coccidioidomycosis-related illness among pa-
tients with cases reported from states where the disease is 
not highly endemic. Our findings are generally consistent 
with the similar surveillance conducted in Arizona during 
2007–2008 in terms of effects on patients (7). Delays in 
diagnosis, unnecessary antibacterial use, and prolonged 
symptoms were common, and a high proportion of patients 
had culture-positive coccidioidomycosis, suggesting that 
less severe cases might go undiagnosed. We found sev-
eral differences between patients in low- and nonendemic 
states, which appear to be related to the underlying popula-
tions and testing patterns.
Patients experienced considerable diagnostic delays. 
Although the median time from symptom onset to seeking 
healthcare (5.5 days) was shorter than in Arizona surveil-
lance (11 days), the median time from seeking healthcare 
to diagnosis (38 days) was longer than in Arizona (23 days) 
and in a study of patients in Missouri (25 days from onset to 
diagnosis) (7,10). Compared with Arizona surveillance, the 
shorter time from onset to seeking care in this investigation 
could be related to an older patient population, whereas the 
longer time from seeking healthcare to diagnosis is likely 
related to lower coccidioidomycosis awareness in low-en-
demic and nonendemic states. Many patients also reported 
initial misdiagnosis before being tested for coccidioidomy-
cosis; however, it is unclear whether those who said they 
were first diagnosed with pneumonia did, in fact, receive 
a correct initial coccidioidomycosis diagnosis but were ei-
ther not informed of the specific etiology or did not remem-
ber being told, or whether they were truly misdiagnosed

 Enhanced Surveillance for Coccidioidomycosis
with bacterial pneumonia. Misdiagnosis seems likely be-
cause of the high proportion of patients who reported being 
diagnosed with another illness and receiving antibacterial 
medication, similar to other studies (7,11). We did not ob-
serve statistically significant differences in misdiagnosis or 
delays in diagnosis between low-endemic and nonendemic 
states, indicating a need for increased healthcare provider 
awareness about coccidioidomycosis in all areas.
The differences between patients from low-endemic 
and nonendemic states appear to reflect underlying popu-
lation demographics and provider testing practices rather 
than differences in disease severity. Enzyme immunoas-
say is commonly used in highly endemic areas as an initial 
test for coccidioidomycosis because it is high-throughput, 
requires less expertise, and is more sensitive (though less 
specific) than other serologic methods (2). Providers and 
laboratories in low-endemic areas might be more familiar 
with this test than those in nonendemic areas, whereas pa-
tients in nonendemic areas were more likely to have posi-
tive coccidioidomycosis cultures. Providers in nonendemic 
areas might not be testing specifically for coccidioidomy-
cosis, but rather diagnosing it incidentally, given that Coc-
cidioides organisms can grow on various culture media. 
Nearly all cultures came from invasive procedures and 
<10% from sputum, suggesting that diagnosis by culture 
was uncommon among patients with uncomplicated prima-
ry pulmonary disease not warranting invasive procedures. 
Some patients from nonendemic states first sought care in 
endemic areas and might have had coccidioidomycosis 
diagnosed there; however, we did not collect data on di-
agnosis location, making geographic differences in testing 
patterns difficult to fully understand. In contrast to possible 
differences in providers’ knowledge of coccidioidomycosis 
tests, patients themselves were more likely to have known 
about coccidioidomycosis before being diagnosed with it 
and were more likely to ask for coccidioidomycosis testing 
if they were reported from nonendemic states. The mod-
est awareness among these patients is probably related to 
the fact that a high proportion resided part-time in Arizona, 
where public outreach about coccidioidomycosis is fre-
quent and awareness is likely to be greater than in other 
areas. Patients in nonendemic states were also more likely 
to know about their positive results before the interview. 
Possible reasons that patients did not know of their positive 
test results include that the patient misunderstood or did 
not remember their diagnosis or that the provider did not 
inform the patient because they believed the results were 
not clinically relevant. The second explanation would also 
support the finding that patients in low-endemic states were 
less likely to be prescribed antifungal medications.
The most common symptoms (cough, fatigue, and 
shortness of breath) and prolonged symptom duration (me-
dian 38.5 days among patients who had recovered at the 
time of the interview) were similar to those in Arizona pa-
tients (42 days) (7). Comparable to our findings, other stud-
ies show that coccidioidomycosis symptoms, particularly 
fatigue, can take months to resolve and profoundly im-
pair physical activities, resulting in missed workdays and

inability to perform usual daily activities (7,12,13). The rea-
sons that patients in low-endemic states were more likely 
to report chest pain, headache, joint pain, and muscle pain 
than patients in nonendemic states are unclear but could 
further reflect geographic differences in testing practices if 
physicians in low-endemic areas are more likely to suspect 
and test for coccidioidomycosis based on those symptoms. 
In previous studies of coccidioidomycosis test positivity 
among community-acquired pneumonia (CAP) patients 
in highly endemic areas, myalgia (11) and rash (14) were 
the only clinical features that differentiated coccidioidal 
CAP from noncoccidioidal CAP. Another study found that 
chest pain was a significant predictor of being tested for 
coccidioidomycosis among CAP patients (15). In addition, 
approximately half of patients in our surveillance reported 
fever, similar to findings in Arizona surveillance (7). 
Potential recall bias is our investigation’s main limita-
tion. However, patient interviews can yield insightful data 
about effects on patients’ daily activities and other infor-
mation that might not be routinely available from medical 
records, such as detailed travel histories.
Travel to or part-time residence in Arizona was fre-
quent among patients reported from nonendemic states. 
Approximately 40 million persons visited Arizona in 
2015 (16), but the number of seasonal residents is more 
challenging to measure; the most recent figures estimated

 Enhanced Surveillance for Coccidioidomycosis
Arizona’s winter-only resident population to be ≈300,000 
during 2000–2001 (17). These seasonal residents, also 
known as snowbirds, are typically retired, older adults who 
have higher socioeconomic statuses than others in their age 
group and who usually cite a more enjoyable climate as 
the reason for their part-time residence outside their home 
state (18). Overall, the risk for acquiring coccidioidomy-
cosis during travel to Arizona is likely small. One expert 
estimated that only 1 in 17,000 visitors would experience 
an infection serious enough to seek medical care (19). 
However, the total number of cases estimated to occur in 
Arizona visitors is estimated to be ≈1,300 per year (19), 
suggesting a public health problem far larger than surveil-
lance detects. The high proportion of cases from nonen-
demic states whose coccidioidomycosis was diagnosed by 
culture (36%, compared with <10% in Arizona surveil-
lance) also indicates that less severe cases go undiagnosed 
or unreported. Obtaining a patient’s history of travel to or 
residence in coccidioidomycosis-endemic areas is essential 
for early diagnosis (2).
Some patients (59% from low-endemic states and 17% 
from nonendemic states) did not report travel to endemic 
areas in the 4 months before symptom onset. A study of 
cases in Missouri residents also found that approximately 
one quarter of patients did not report travel to endemic ar-
eas during the 3 weeks before symptom onset (10). Incom-
plete travel histories or travel that occurred >4 months be-
fore symptom onset likely explain the lack of recent travel 
to endemic areas among patients from nonendemic states 
in our surveillance. In low-endemic states, most cases in 
patients without recent travel to other endemic areas could 
presumably be locally acquired. A deeper understanding of 
the highest-risk geographic areas in those states is needed.
We classified Oregon as nonendemic; although Coc-
cidioides spp. DNA was identified from several soil sam-
ples in central Oregon in 2016, the fungus has not been cul-
tured from environmental samples (20). Our surveillance 
identified culture-confirmed coccidioidomycosis in 1 Or-
egon patient who did not recently travel to known endemic 
areas, and the acute nature of his illness did not suggest re-
activation of infection acquired during his earlier travel to 
Mexico. The patient reported extensive exposure to alfalfa 
hay (of unknown source), and rare coccidioidomycosis cas-
es have been transmitted by similar fomites (21), suggest-
ing that acquisition from the local environment and remote 
travel are not the only possible sources of infection. Un-
fortunately, a suitable clinical isolate was not available for 
whole-genome sequencing and comparison to isolates from 
nearby states. Such testing, in combination with environ-
mental isolates, has enabled identification of cases acquired 
from the natural environment in south-central Washington 
(4,22) and could allow for discovery of similar transmis-
sion in Oregon, if present.
Our results could be used to inform minor revisions 
to the CSTE case definition. In nonendemic areas or areas 
with unknown endemicity, interpretation of positive coc-
cidioidomycosis serologic test results can be challenging 
if the patient is asymptomatic, has no relevant travel or an 
unknown travel history, or has laboratory evidence of a dif-
ferent disease. In this surveillance, >16% (54/339) of pa-
tients whose illness met the CSTE definition likely did not 
have coccidioidomycosis; all but 1 were from nonendemic 
states, and many had histoplasmosis, which is known to 
cause cross-reactions with coccidioidomycosis serologic 
tests (23). Some states are already excluding such cases 
from their case-counts even though the CSTE definition 
does not specify exclusion criteria. Similarly, the CSTE 
definition does not state whether cases counted in a pre-
vious year should be counted again if subsequent positive 
laboratory tests are reported. Most states, including Ari-
zona, only count cases once because infection is thought 
to confer lifelong immunity. Seven percent of patients in 
our analysis self-reported a history of coccidioidomycosis, 
 
but we were not able to determine if their cases had been 
previously reported in other states. Last, 9% of patients we 
interviewed did not report symptoms, although the actual 
proportion could be higher because some patients were 
not contacted for an interview because their illnesses were 
thought to be clinically incompatible with coccidioidomy-
cosis. In Arizona’s enhanced surveillance, 5% of patients 
had no symptoms or symptoms inconsistent with coccidi-
oidomycosis according to the CSTE definition, suggesting 
that the CSTE definition’s laboratory component alone is 
sufficiently specific for public health surveillance (7). Fur-
ther characterization of clinical scenarios involving asymp-
tomatic patients with positive coccidioidomycosis tests 
could inform clinical practice and disease surveillance. 
Overall, the contributions of false-positive laboratory tests, 
previously reported cases, and asymptomatic cases to na-
tional-level case-counts are undoubtedly small, but they 
serve as examples of ways that coccidioidomycosis surveil-
lance could be improved.
Although Coccidioides is most common in Arizona 
and California, coccidioidomycosis is a disease of national 
importance. Our investigation revealed many cases associ-
ated with travel to or part-time residence in highly endemic 
areas, as well as cases presumably acquired in Nevada, New 
Mexico, and Utah. Patients experienced substantial delays 
in diagnosis and prolonged symptoms, leading to lost pro-
ductivity. The high proportion of culture-positive cases 
suggests that less severe cases go undiagnosed, resulting 
in underestimates of the actual number of cases, which is 
typical for public health surveillance. Greater awareness 
nationwide among clinicians and the public about coccidi-
oidomycosis is needed to minimize delays in diagnosis and 
appropriate treatment.
