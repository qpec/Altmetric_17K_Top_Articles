Increasing the thermogenic capacity of adipose tissue to enhance organismal energy
expenditure is considered a promising therapeutic strategy to combat obesity. Here, we
report that expression of the p38 MAPK activator MKK6 is elevated in white adipose tissue
of obese individuals. Using knockout animals and shRNA, we show that Mkk6 deletion
increases energy expenditure and thermogenic capacity of white adipose tissue, protecting
mice against diet-induced obesity and the development of diabetes. Deletion of Mkk6
increases T3-stimulated UCP1 expression in adipocytes, thereby increasing their thermogenic
capacity. Mechanistically, we demonstrate that, in white adipose tissue, p38 is activated by
an alternative pathway involving AMPK, TAK, and TAB. Our results identify MKK6 in adi-
pocytes as a potential therapeutic target to reduce obesity.

 T
he incidence of obesity and associated diseases is increasing
worldwide. Defined as an exacerbated increase in body
weight associated with fat accumulation, obesity is the
consequence of a sustained positive energy balance that occurs
when energy intake is higher than energy expenditure. Some
pharmacological drugs specifically designed to treat obesity have
focussed on reducing mainly food intake; however, this approach
has had limited efficacy and is associated with undesired
secondary effects. Therefore, new strategies are needed to treat
obesity and diabetes1.
Brown adipose tissue (BAT) is specialized in the dissipation
of energy as heat to protect against hypothermia, in a process
known as non-shivering thermogenesis2, 3. BAT was thought
to disappear shortly after birth; however, positron emission
tomography
identified
metabolically
active
BAT
in
adults
in defined regions, and scattered within white adipose tissue
(WAT), suggesting a possible influence on whole-body energy
homeostasis4–6. The ability to generate heat (thermogenic
capacity) depends on uncoupling protein 1 (UCP1)7. UCP1 forms
a pore in the inner mitochondrial membrane, through which
protons can leak, dissipating the electrochemical proton gradient
required for ATP synthesis in the mitochondrial matrix. As a
result, ATP synthesis is blunted and the energy is released as heat.
Brown adipocyte function is regulated in part by thyroid
hormones (TH). T3 promotes mitochondrial biogenesis, induces
the expression of UCP1, and increases the activity of brown
adipocytes8, 9. T3 has also been implicated in the induction of the
browning of WAT in humans10. Increased UCP1 expression in
WAT has been suggested as a mechanism for the prevention of
obesity11.
However,
little
is
known
about
the
molecular
mechanism controlling this browning process in WAT.
p38α is activated by low temperatures12. Moreover, cell-culture
studies with p38 inhibitors have identified p38 kinase as a
possible mediator of UCP1 expression in the browning12, 13.
Besides, the p38 downstream target activating transcription factor
2 (ATF2) induces the expression of peroxisome proliferator-
activated receptor gamma (PPARγ) co-activator 1α (PGC-1α),
and these two nuclear transcription factors together control the
expression of UCP112. The stress-activated protein kinase (SAPK)
pathway is composed by two main branches: p38 kinases
and the c-Jun N-terminal protein kinases (JNK). There are
four p38 isoforms (α, β, γ, and δ) and three JNK isoforms (JNK1,
2, and 3)14. The JNK pathway has been extensively studied and is
implicated in the development of obesity and insulin resistance15.
In contrast, the role of p38 kinases in this context has received
less attention, and their physiological role remains poorly
understood.
In this study, we investigated the role of the upstream p38
activator MAPK kinase 6 (MKK6) during obesity induced by a
high-fat diet (HFD). Lack of MKK6 increases the basal expression
of UCP1 and promotes T3-mediated induction of UCP1
expression in WAT. Moreover, the browning of WAT and sub-
sequent increased energy expenditure in mice lacking MKK6
protects these animals against HFD-induced obesity. This
phenotype depends on T3 signaling: the lack of MKK6 increases
the sensitivity of adipose tissue to T3-mediated browning. These
results indicate that MKK6 is a central regulator of WAT
browning and is a possible target for obesity treatment.
Results
Lack of MKK6 induces resistance to diet-induced obesity.
MKKs are the activators of the MAPK family members and
control multiple cell responses to diverse stimuli16. Although
certain MKKs and their downstream pathways are known to be
activated in human adipose tissue during obesity17, the role of
MKK6 is still unknown. Analysis of protein levels of MKK6 in
fat of lean and obese mice (fed a HFD for 8 weeks) revealed
markedly higher levels of MKK6 in epididymal white fat (eWAT)
and subcutaneous fat (sWAT) than mice fed a standard chow
diet, indicating a possible role of MKK6 in WAT metabolism
(Fig. 1a and Supplementary Fig. 1a). No differences were
observed in muscle and liver, while BAT presented a reduction in
MKK6 expression after HFD (Supplementary Fig. 1a).
To explore this further, we fed HFD to mice lacking MKK6
(Mkk6−/−). Compared with wild-type (WT) controls, Mkk6−/−
mice were protected against HFD-induced obesity (Fig. 1b). The
lower body weight in Mkk6−/− mice correlated with a lower fat
mass detected by nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) (Fig. 1c).
Further analysis showed that the weight of liver, eWAT, sWAT,
and BAT was lower in Mkk6−/− mice (Supplementary Fig. 1b).
These differences were associated with smaller adipocytes and
lipid droplets (Supplementary Fig. 1c, d) and a protection against
liver steatosis (Supplementary Fig. 1c, e).
Mkk6−/− mice are protected against diabetes. The reduced fat
accumulation in Mkk6−/− mice prompted us to investigate
whether
these
mice
were
protected
against
HFD-induced
diabetes.
Mkk6−/−
mice
had
significantly
lower
levels
of
HFD-induced hyperglycemia and hyperinsulinemia than WT
mice, presenting lower insulin resistance (Fig. 1d–f). Moreover,
HFD-fed Mkk6−/− mice showed enhanced glucose tolerance
(Fig. 1g) and insulin sensitivity (Fig. 1h). The greater glucose
tolerance in Mkk6−/− mice was matched by a higher glucose-
induced blood insulin concentration (Fig. 1i). These data indicate
that MKK6 deficiency protects against HFD-induced insulin
resistance. Western blot analysis showed that suppression
of insulin-stimulated AKT activation as a result of HFD was
substantially prevented in eWAT from Mkk6−/− mice with liver
and skeletal muscle also partially protected (Fig. 1j and Supple-
mentary Fig. 1f). These results confirm that HFD-fed Mkk6−/−
mice have higher systemic insulin sensitivity than WT mice.
Higher energy expenditure and WAT browning in Mkk6−/−
mice. Indirect calorimetry analysis demonstrated that HFD-Mkk6−/−
mice had higher energy expenditure (EE) that WT independently
of its correction or not by lean mass (Fig. 2a) without significant
differences in O2/CO2 gas exchange, locomotor activity, or food
intake (Supplementary Fig. 2a). The increased EE by MKK6 defi-
ciency was likely to be a major determinant of MKK6-regulated
obesity and prompted us to examine thermogenesis. When main-
tained at room temperature (23 °C), the core body temperature of
HFD-fed Mkk6−/− mice was higher than their WT counterparts
(Fig. 2b). Since BAT is the main regulator of body temperature in
mice, we asked whether the lower lipid content in BAT of Mkk6−/−
mice was caused by thermogenesis due to higher BAT activity.
However, analysis with an infrared (IR) camera showed no differ-
ences in BAT temperature between genotypes (Supplementary
Fig. 2b). Moreover, there were no differences in RNA or protein
expression of UCP1, the main enzyme responsible for mitochondria
thermogenesis in BAT (Supplementary Fig. 2c). Messenger RNA
(mRNA) levels of other genes associated with BAT activity were also
unaltered in Mkk6−/− mice, including the transcriptional coactivators
Ppargc1a, Ppargc1b, Cidea, and the metabolic enzymes Accb and
Ldhb (Supplementary Fig. 2d, e).
Recent reports show that specific stimuli can induce thermo-
genic capability to WAT in a process called “WAT browning”, in
which the adipocytes activate typical genes of BAT18–20. Analysis
of BAT-associated genes in epididymal and subcutaneous white
fat revealed that WAT from Mkk6−/− mice expressed elevated
mRNA levels of the browning and mitochondrial biogenesis

 markers as Cidea21, and Cpt1b, Cpt2, and Cox8b (Fig. 2c, d and
Supplementary Fig. 2g). Moreover eWAT and iWAT showed
increased UCP1 at mRNA and protein levels (Fig. 2d, e and
Supplementary Fig. 2f). Proton NMR spectroscopy (1H-MRS)
analysis of the eWAT tissue from HFD-Mkk6−/− mice identified
a BAT-like spectrum profile (Fig. 2f), with water signal and six fat
peaks resolvable in spectroscopy22 as is characteristic of BAT
(Supplementary Fig. 2h) and different from WAT. Furthermore,
in vivo phosphorus NMR spectroscopy (31P-MRS) also indicated
a lower total ATP content with respect to total free inorganic
phosphate (Pi) in Mkk6−/− eWAT pointing out to a reduced ATP
synthesis (Fig. 2f). On the basis of these observations, we
hypothesized that the increased energy metabolism in Mkk6−/−
mice might be a consequence of increased non-shivering
thermogenesis in WAT. To test this, we housed animals at
different temperatures. Under thermoneutral conditions (30 °C),
when adaptive thermogenesis is not required, weight gain was
similar between HFD-fed WT and Mkk6−/− mice (Fig. 2g).
Besides, HFD-Mkk6−/− mice are more resistant to cold exposure
(4 °C) (Fig. 2h), and after this browning stimulus, Mkk6−/− mice

 expressed higher UCP1 levels in subcutaneous white fat than their
WT counterparts (Fig. 2i). Taken together, these data indicate
that the low-weight gain in HFD-fed Mkk6−/− mice is due to
WAT browning and the associated increase in thermogenesis.
VMH deletion of Mkk6 does not affect systemic metabolism.
The central nervous system is a key regulator of whole-body
metabolism and can control weight gain through several
mechanisms including browning17, 23. The ventromedial hypo-
thalamus (VMH) is a region that controls feeding and thermo-
regulation24. Thereby, we assessed the metabolic phenotype after
the stereotaxic injection of lentivirus containing MKK6 short
hairpin RNA (shRNA; shMkk6) into the VMH. After the
injection, mice were fed a HFD for 8 weeks and the levels of
MKK6 in the whole hypothalamus were assessed (Supplementary
Fig. 3a). Mice treated with shMKK6 showed no differences in
body weight, body composition, or food intake compared with
mice injected with lentivirus containing scramble control shRNA
(Supplementary Fig. 3b–e). Furthermore, shMkk6-treated mice
were not protected against HFD-induced glucose intolerance
(Supplementary Fig. 3f).
Peripheral suppression of MKK6 protects against obesity. The
above results might suggest that obesity protection in Mkk6−/−
mice is mediated by a peripheral mechanism, independent of
MKK6 signaling in the brain. To investigate this possibility, we
administered shMkk6 lentivirus intravenously. Western blot
analysis
confirmed
reduced
MKK6
expression
in
adipose
tissue and liver (Supplementary Fig. 4a, b). Intravenous shMkk6
protected mice against HFD-induced obesity (Supplementary
Fig. 4c), decreased weight of eWAT, BAT, and liver, but not
skeletal muscle (Supplementary Fig. 4d), and gave partial
protection against liver steatosis (Supplementary Fig. 4e). In
addition, shMkk6-treated mice had lower fasting serum glucose
levels, showing protection against hyperglycemia (Supplementary
Fig. 4f). These results thus confirm that the phenotype of
Mkk6−/− mice has a peripheral origin. To discard a possible role
of MKK6 in HFD-induced obesity in muscle and liver, we
generated conditional mice of Mkk6 (Supplementary Fig. 4g).
Analysis of mice lacking MKK6 in liver or muscle discarded a role
of these organs in the phenotype and suggested a cell autonomus
role of MKK6 in WAT (Supplementary Fig. 4i, j).
p38 activation through the AMPK/TAK/TAB pathway in
Mkk6−/−. BAT expression of UCP1 and PGC1α is believed to be
regulated by p38 kinases through activation of the transcription
factors ATF2 and CREB25. Western blot analysis of WAT from
HFD-fed mice demonstrated enhanced activation of p38, ATF2,
and CREB in Mkk6−/− animals (Fig. 3a). These results are
unexpected because MKK6 is a canonical p38 activator. In BAT,
GADD45γ
induces
thermogenic
gene
expression
through
activation of p38 after norepinephrin stimulous26. To study if
lack of MKK6 could affect GADD45γ expression, we performed
real-time quantitative reverse transcription PCR (qRT-PCR)
analysis of Gadd45g expression in eWAT. No differences were
found between WT and Mkk6−/− animals (Supplementary
Fig. 5a). It has been postulated that in absence of the canonical
activation, p38 can be triggered by an alternative pathway
involving AMPK and TAB1/TAK1 complex27. In agreement with
this hypothesis, AMPK was hyperactivated in WAT from HFD-
fed Mkk6−/− mice as judged by phosphorylation levels of AMPK
and its substrate ACC (Fig. 3a). Moreover, p38 and AMPK were
also hyperactivated in adipocytes derived from Mkk6−/− animals
as shown by ATF2 and ACC phosphorylation (Fig. 3b). To assess
whether AMPK/TAB/TAK1 was involved in p38 hyperactivation,
we infected Mkk6−/− pre-adipocytes with lentiviral vectors con-
taining shRNA against AMPK, TAB1, and TAK1. Reduction of
AMPK, TAK1, or TAB1 protein levels resulted in lower p38
phosphorylation and activation as it is shown by ATF2 phos-
phorylation (Fig. 3c). These results indicate that in absence of
MKK6, adipocytes spontaneously engaged the metabolic master
regulator AMPK to trigger p38 activation.
Mkk6 deficiency increases adipocyte sensitivity to the T3. Next,
we addressed whether the effect of MKK6 on WAT function was
cell-autonomous using adipocytes from WT and Mkk6−/− mice.
First, we analyzed whether MKK6 was required to suppress UCP1
expression. In correlation with the increased ATF2 phosphor-
ylation, we found intensified UCP1 levels in Mkk6−/− adipocytes
(Fig. 3d). These data indicate that lack of MKK6 increased
UCP1 expression in adipocytes in a cell-autonomous manner. To
asses p38α implication in the increased UCP1 levels detected
in Mkk6−/− adipocytes, Mkk6−/− pre-adipocytes infected with
lentiviral vectors containing shRNA against p38α were differ-
entiated to adipocytes and UCP1 levels quantified. Decrease of
p38α resulted in a reduction of UCP1 protein levels (Fig. 4e),
showing that p38α activation observed in Mkk6−/− adipocytes
participates in the enhanced UPC1 expression. The higher
WAT UCP1 content in Mkk6−/− could corroborate substantial
mitochondrial proton leak as a mechanism to dissipate energy as
heat. To test this possibility, we measured the respiratory capacity
of white adipocytes. In concordance with higher UCP1 expres-
sion, Mkk6−/− adipocytes had a lower spare respiratory capacity
than WT adipocytes regardless of the source of the nutrient
(glucose or fatty acid) (Fig. 3f). Moreover, transmission electron
microscopy analysis of mitochondria from eWAT showed
clear differences in mitochondria with higher mitochondria
electrodensity observed in the Mkk6−/− indicating that this

 mitochondria are more active than the ones from WT (Fig. 3g).
To investigate whether Mkk6−/− white pre-adipocytes were
more prompted to differentiate to brown adipocytes than WT,
white pre-adipocytes were differentiated using a white adipocyte
differentiation
protocol
(WAT)
or
a
brown
adipocyte
differentiation protocol (WAT + BAT). Only Mkk6−/− WAT
adipocytes
differentiated
by
the
BAT
protocol
enhanced
the oxygen consumption in response to norepinephrine, a
characteristic of brown adipocytes, supporting a browning
phenotype of Mkk6−/− WAT (Supplementary Fig. 5b).
WAT browning in vivo is mediated through a cascade
involving β3-adrenergic receptor activation and TH signaling.
To investigate which factors contribute to the WAT browning
observed in Mkk6−/− mice, we monitored UCP1 expression in
immortalized Mkk6−/− and WT white adipocytes stimulated with
T3, T4, and norepinephrine (Fig. 3h). Importantly, adipocytes
from Mkk6−/− mice were more sensitive to TH stimulation,
expressing higher levels of UCP1 than WT cells (Fig. 3h and
Supplementary Fig. 5c). Ucp1 expression is regulated by a highly
conserved enhancer element with binding sites for nuclear
receptors and bZIP transcriptional factors28. Then, we used a
chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP) assay to analyze the
binding of TH receptors (THRs) to the UCP1 enhancer in
differentiated WAT from WT and Mkk6−/− mice. We observed a
significant enrichment in UCP1 enhancer in Mkk6−/− adipocytes
after ChIP with THRα/β antibody (Fig. 3i) indicating higher
sensibility to TH and explaining the increased UCP1 expression.
Since our data indicated that p38 activation in WAT was
mediated by AMPK, which enhanced UCP1, we evaluated
whether T3 could trigger AMPK activation. T3 treatment
increased AMPK phosphorylation and activation that correlated
with higher levels of UCP1 (Supplementary Fig. 5d).
To determine the relationship between MKK6 loss and
T3-induced
mitochondrial
reorganization,
adipocytes
were
co-stained with the fluorescent dyes Bodipy (which selectively
binds to accumulated neutral lipids) and Mitotracker (selective
for intracellular mitochondria) (Supplementary Fig. 5e). Lipid
droplets looked smaller in Mkk6−/− where T3 stimulation seemed
to promote lipid droplet breakage that was absent in the WT.
The staining correlates with the mitochondrial distribution in
T3-treated Mkk6−/− indicating enhanced metabolic activity.
Together, these data indicate that in Mkk6−/− adipocytes T3
promotes a fast lipid utilization by mitochondria in parallel to the
increase in UCP1, ultimately leading to the browning of white
adipocytes.
TH contribute to the metabolic actions of MKK6. We next
examined the potential causal link thyroid hormone inducing
WAT browning and the prevention of HFD-induced weight gain
in Mkk6−/− mice. Treatment of mice with propylthiouracil
(PTU), an inhibitor of thyroid hormone production29, suppressed
the effects of thyroid hormone-responsive genes in the WAT of
Mkk6−/− mice (Fig. 4a compared to Fig. 2c, d), the differences in
weight and fat mass (Fig. 4b–d), and the changes in glucose and
insulin tolerance tests (Fig. 4e) between genotypes. After PTU
treatment, EE and body temperature in Mkk6−/− mice were
similar to readings in WT counterpart, with no changes in
locomotor activity or food intake (Fig. 4f). Suppression of TH
production also eliminated the increased Ucp1 expression in
WAT (Fig. 4g), while levels in BAT were unaltered (Supple-
mentary Fig. 6a, b). Correct TH inhibition by PTU was assayed by
the thyroid expression of genes controlled by TH (Supplementary
Fig. 6c). These results indicate that the metabolic phenotype
of Mkk6−/− mice involves an elevated responsiveness of WAT
to TH.
To rule out that part of the effects in vivo were due to changes
in the serum TH levels in Mkk6−/− mice, we evaluated circulating
T3 and T4, and thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH) levels. While
no differences were observed in T3 or T4, serum TSH and
pituitary expression of Tshb were significantly reduced in Mkk6
−/− mice (Supplementary Fig. 7a, b) correlating with an increased
sensitivity to T3. Although we did not find any change in total
hypothalamic content of Trh (thyrotropin-releasing hormone)
mRNA, or Ttf1, Tshr, or Tpo mRNA in the thyroid gland, we
found a substantial repression of thyroglobulin and pendrin (Pds/
Slc26A4, the basal iodine transporter), two essential genes in the
hormone synthesis pathway in the thyroid, that indicated a
physiological extreme downregulation due to T3 hypersensitivity
(Supplementary Fig. 7c, d).
We also examined mRNA expression of deiodinases (Dio1,
2, 3) and α and β THRs in eWAT, BAT, and liver. As shown in
the Supplementary Fig. 8, the only consistent change in all tissues
studied is a reduction in Dio2 expression (the key enzyme
converting
inactive
T4
into
active
T3)
being
statistically
significant only in BAT. This reduced Dio2 expression would
reflect again and a cellular hypersensibility to otherwise normal
serum levels of T3.
To further investigate TH responsiveness in more detail, we
first suppressed endogenous TH production by administering
PTU to WT and Mkk6−/− mice fed a HFD for 2 weeks, and then
treated all animals with T3. Both genotypes showed similar
weight gain after treatment with PTU initially (Fig. 5a); however,
after addition of exogenous T3 weight gain in Mkk6−/− mice
decreased with respect to WT mice (Fig. 5a). After 8 weeks of T3
treatment, Mkk6−/− mice had lower fat mass and fat accumula-
tion in several tissues than WT mice, (Fig. 5b, c) and improved
fed glucose levels (Fig. 5d). T3 treatment also increased EE
in Mkk6−/− mice (Fig. 5e), correlating with activation of
TH-controlled genes in WAT (Fig. 5f, g) with no differences in
liver and only increase of Ppargc1a in BAT (Supplementary
Fig. 9). These results confirm that lack of MKK6 increases
the sensitivity of WAT to TH in vivo, resulting in a browning
effect in WAT.
Knocking down Mkk6 reduces HFD-induced metabolic syn-
drome. To test whether depletion of MKK6 has potential as a
treatment for obesity, we fed a HFD to WT mice for 8 weeks and
then injected them i.v. with lentivirus expressing a scrambled
sequence or a shRNA targeting MKK6 (Fig. 6a) that we had
already known that reduced MKK6 in adipose tissue (Supple-
mentary Fig. 4a). Mice injected with shMkk6 gained less body
mass after lentiviral administration (Fig. 6b) and were protected
against
HFD-induced
hyperinsulinemia
and
hyperglycemia
(Fig. 6c, d). These results indicate that inhibition of MKK6 in
peripheral tissues, and particularly in WAT, could have potential
in humans as a treatment for obesity and the associated diabetes.
To further study whether these effects observed in mice would
be transferable to humans, MKK6 expression in visceral fat from
obese and lean individuals was investigated. Analysis of MKK6
protein levels in visceral fat revealed markedly higher levels of
MKK6 in obese patients (Fig. 6e).
In conclusion, our data demonstrate that the expression of MKK6
in WAT is important to establish the obese phenotype and resistance
to TH. Moreover, its ablation allows WAT UCP1 expression and
browning mediated by normal levels of T3 with the consequent
increase in EE ameliorating obesity and diabetes (Fig. 7).
Discussion
In this report, we show that the activity of the mitogen protein
kinase MKK6 prevents the browning of WAT. Thus, the WAT of

 mice lacking this kinase have elevated expression of UCP1, the
landmark of browing, as well as other important regulators of this
process, such as CIDEA, PGC1α, and PGC1β. Our results
demonstrate
the
physiological
relevance
of
this
effect
in
controlling whole-body metabolism and obesity. Lack of MKK6
increases EE and body temperature, protecting animals from
HFD-induced obesity and diet-induced diabetes. WAT browning
is required for efficient protection, given that the phenotype
is attenuated when animals are kept under thermoneutral
conditions, indicating that manifestation of the phenotype
requires active thermogenesis. The browning of WAT and the
protection
against
HFD
are
dependent
on
the
increased
sensitivity of Mkk6−/− white adipocytes to T3, as they are ablated
by inhibition of T3 production with PTU treatment and restored
by retreatment with exogenous T3. The role of MKK6 in
controlling browning is reinforced by the observation that
T3 induces higher levels of UCP1 expression in differentiated
Mkk6−/− adipocytes than in WT counterparts. Importantly, the
results obtained in animal models seem to have clinical relevance,
since higher levels of MKK6 were found in the fat of obese
patients.
BAT is central in thermogenesis for cold adaptation and energy
balance, and depends on the action of UCP130. UCP1 expression
is regulated by the sympathetic nervous system, mainly through
norepinephrine and thyroid hormone31. T3 potentiates the effect
of norepinephrine and is essential for the action of UCP1 in cold
adaptation32. Our observation extends the role of T3 to the
control of browning of WAT and the implication of MKK6/p38
in this signaling. Importantly, these effects could be only found in
WAT, since the lack of MKK6 in other tissues such as liver or
muscle did not cause any relevant metabolic change.
Mkk6−/− mice present normal T4 with reduced TSH levels, a
whole mark of subclinical hyperthyroidism status33. Through
different subsets of experiments, we have discarded diferent
causes for subclinical hypertiroidism. Our data indicated that
hypothalamus was not implicated in the phenotype (Supple-
mentary Figs. 4 and 6). Serum T3 strongly reflects liver produc-
tion by DIO234, 35. Higher T3 conversion from T4 through
increased expression of DIO2 was also discarded (Supplementary
Fig. 8). In the other hand, we have obtained relevant data indi-
cating a cellular T3 hypersensitivity in the Mkk6−/− mice mainly
affecting WAT (Fig. 3). Furthermore, T3 induces stronger
UCP1 expression in Mkk6−/− adipocytes than in WT (Fig. 3 and
Supplementary Fig. 5). In addition, injection of a fixed dose of T3
in PTU hypothyroid mice fed with a HFD recover the lean
phenotype (less weight, less hyperglycemia, less fat, and increased
browning) only in Mkk6−/− mice but not in the WT (Fig. 5).
Overall, we have found a positive modulator of T3 action at the
white adipocyte cellular level in MKK6 with potential clinical
relevance (Fig. 7). Although the implication of TH in metabolic
and cellular actions on fat and other tissues including browning
have been reported36, 37, our data present for the first time an
“intracellular modulation of the T3 activity” independently of the
THRs, Trh, Tsh, or T4, and with normal levels of T3. These
regulation might allow the modulation of T3 action specifically in
WAT through MKK6 antagonists, which would prevent the

 appearance of TH-associated off-target effects in other tissues.
These findings have translational relevance because of high
proportion of WAT in obese humans and the fact that human
beige/brite adipocytes seem to be functional.
We also demonstrate that in WAT, the activation of p38 could
be mediated by the alternative mechanism involving AMPK/
TAK/TAB. The regulation of p38 activation by AMPK and its
interaction with the scaffold protein TAB1 has been shown
previously in cardiomiocytes and T cells27, 38. However, it was
thought that this alternative activation was specific of these
tissues. Here, for the first time we show that AMPK/TAB1
pathway controls p38 MAPK activation in white adipocytes.
These results have important clinical relevance because activators
of AMPK could be used to activate the p38 pathway in
adipocytes, and increase browning of WAT through the ATF2
phosphorylation and UCP1 transcription.
In
summary,
as
in
obese
individuals,
the
ability
to
induce browning is reduced6, 39, our results have potential
clinical significance. In humans, it has highlighted the role of
beige/brite fat as opposed to real BAT, hence the increase of
MKK6 levels in obese individuals suggest that impaired brite
function activation may be in part mediated by this excess of
MKK6 in adipose tissue. The higher action of MKK6 axes in
visceral fat of obese individuals might contribute to make
their adipose tissue resistant to T3, what would underlie the
observed resistance to WAT browning. This also agrees with
the
observation
that
obese
patients
have
significantly
elevated TSH with lower T4 levels, as found not only in a
population study with >4600 individuals40, but also in a smaller
but well-controlled study in 581 obese patients excluding
diabetes, thyroid, and other endocrine diseases41. The high-TSH/
low-T4 profile could be due to a peripheral resistance against
T3 induced by obesity42 and is also significantly correlated
with insulin resistance40.
In addition, since it has been recently shown that the
expression of browning genes in human WAT correlates with
serum T44, our findings suggest that the levels of MKK6 in
adipose tissue may be of relevance for the weight gain and weight
loss seen in hypo and hyperthyroid patients, respectively.
However, further studies should assess this aspect in the
appropriate cohort of patients.
Our findings establish a role for MKK6 in the regulation
of body energy balance through the modulation of WAT
browning, with potential implications for the treatment of
obesity.
Methods
Study population and sample collection. The study population included
58 adults with body mass index (BMI) ≥35 who underwent elective bariatric
surgery at the University Hospital of Salamanca. Patients were excluded if
they had a history of alcohol abuse or excessive alcohol consumption (>30 g
per day in men and >20 g per day in women), chronic hepatitis C or B.
Control subjects (n = 13) were recruited among patients who underwent
laparoscopic cholecystectomy for gallstone disease. The study was approved by
the Ethics Committee of the University Hospital of Salamanca and all subjects
provided written informed consent to undergo visceral fat biopsy under direct
vision during surgery.
Data were collected on demographic information (age, sex, and ethnicity),
anthropomorphic measurements (BMI), smoking and alcohol history, coexisting
medical conditions, and medication use. Before surgery, fasting venous blood
samples were collected for measuring complete cell blood count, total bilirubin,
aspartate aminotransferase (AST), alanine AST (ALT), total cholesterol, high-
density lipoprotein, low-density lipoprotein, triglycerides, creatinine, glucose,
and albumin (Supplementary Table 1).
Animal models. The use and generation of C57Bl6J WT mice and knockout
mice lacking MKK6 kinase in homozygosis (Mkk6−/−, B6.129-Map2k6tm1Flv) was
previously described43. All the animals were maintained on a C57BL/6J back-
ground (back-crossed 10 generations). Mice with a germ-line mutation in the
Map2k6 gene and LoxP elements inserted into two introns (Map2k6LoxP) were
generated after homologous recombination in ES cells. ES cells were electroporated
with this vector (Supplementary Fig. 4g) and selected with 200 μg/ml G418 and
2 μM gangcyclovir. Several correctly targeted ES cell clones were identified by
southern blot and PCR. These ES cell clones were injected into C57BL/6J
blastocysts to create chimeric mice that transmitted the mutated Map2k6 allele
through the germ line. The Flp NeoR cassette was excised by crossing these mice
with ACTB:FLPe B6;SJL mice, which express a FLP1 recombinase gene under the
direction of the human ACTB promoter. These animals were crossed with FVB-Tg
(Ckmm-cre)5Khn/J line on the C57BL/6J background (Jackson Laboratory) to
generate mice lacking MKK6 in muscle and with B6.Cg-Tg(Alb-cre)21Mgn/J for
deletion in hepatocytes. Genotype was confirmed by PCR analysis of genomic
DNA. Male mice were fed with a normal chow diet or a HFD (Research Diets Inc.)
for 8 weeks ad libidum. PTU treatment was administrated for 8 weeks in the
drinking water at 1.2 mM together with Kool Aid™ to improve the taste. In
some experiments, T3 (3 μg/100 g in 0.2% BSA–PBS) was injected i.p. daily.
For temperature experiments, mice were housed at 30 °C for 8 weeks while feeding
a HFD in case of thermoneutral analysis, and exposed to 4 °C for 1 h or 1 week
after HFD treatment in case of cold adaptation studies. All animal procedures
conformed to EU Directive 86/609/EEC and Recommendation 2007/526/EC
regarding the protection of animals used for experimental and other scientific
purposes, enacted under Spanish law 1201/2005. The procedures have been
reviewed by the Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee (IACUC) of Centro
Nacional de Investigaciones Cardiovasculares, and approved by Consejeria de
Medio Ambiente, Administración Local y Ordenación del Territorio of Comunidad
de Madrid.
Lentiviral vector production and mice infection. Lentiviruses were produced as
described44. Briefly, transient calcium phosphate cotransfection of HEK-293 cells
was done with the pGIZP empty, pGIZP.shMkk6, pGIZP.shAmpk, pGIZP.shTak1,
pGIZP.shTab1, or pGIZT.shMapk14 vectors from Thermo scientific together
with pΔ8.9 and pVSV-G. The supernatants containing the LV particles were
collected 48 and 72 h after removal of the calcium phosphate precipitate,
and were centrifuged at 700 × g, 4 °C for 10 min, and concentrated (165×) by
ultracentrifugation for 2 h at 121986 g at 4 °C (Ultraclear Tubes, SW28 rotor and
Optima L-100 XP Ultracentrifuge; Beckman). Viruses were collected by adding
cold sterile PBS and were titrated by quantitative PCR.
Mice were injected in VMH or tail vein with lentiviral particles suspended in
PBS. Seven days after infection, mice were fed a HFD diet.

 Cell culture. For obtaining white pre-adipocites, WT and Mkk6−/− inguinal
fat were mechanically and enzymatically disaggregated using type-A collagenase
(2 mg/ml collagenase type-A, Roche) at 37 °C. Cell suspension passed through a
70 µm cell strainer (Falcon) to eliminate stroma and debris, and centrifuged at
400 × g for 8 min at RT. Pellet was collected and cells were counted using a
CasyTon cell counter. Pre-adipocytes were inmortalized by infection with SV40T-
pBABE-neo virus. Cells were differentiated to adipocytes for 9 days in 8%
FCS medium supplemented with 5 μg/ml insulin, 25 μg/ml IBMX, 1 μg/ml
dexamethasone, and 1 μM troglitazone. Then cultures were incubated with 100 nM
T3, 100 nM T4, and 1 μM norepinephrine for 48 h before extraction. Alternatively,
pre-adipocytes were differentiated to adipocytes using brown adipocyte
differentiation protocol in which cells were induced to brown fat with 20 nM
insulin, 1 nM T3, 125 μM indomethacin, 2 μg/ml dexamethasone, and 50 mM
IBMX for 48 h, and maintained with 20 nM of insulin, and 1 nM of T3 for 8 days.
In some experiments, white pre-adipocytes were infected with lentivirus containing
shRNA targeting AMPK, TAK1, TAB1, p38α, or a scrambled sequence, and
selected by resistance to puromycin.
Cell cultures used in this paper were tested for mycoplasma infection.
Analysis of mitochondrial function. Pre-dipocytes were plated and differentiated
in gelatin (0.1%)-coated 96 seahorse plates. T3 stimulation was performed 48 h
prior to the oxygen consumption analysis. MitoStress oxygen consumption rate
(OCR) was assessed in XF medium containing either 25 mM glucose (glucose
oxidation medium) or 1 mM palmitate, 2 mM L-glutamine, and 1 mM sodium
pyruvate (fatty acid oxidation medium) using a XF-96 extracellular flux analyzers
(Seahorse Bioscience, Agilent Technologies), and data normalized by cell number
(CyQuant, Invitrogen). Spare respiration capacity (OCR carbonyl cyanide-4-(tri-
fluoromethoxy)phenylhydrazone (FCCP)/OCR basal) and oxygen consumption in
response to norepinephrine (NE) (fold increase (FI) NE/basal) was calculated.
Western blot. Samples were lysated with RIPA buffer containing protease and
phosphatase inhibitors (Tris-Hcl 50 mM, pH 7,5; Triton X-100 1%; EDTA 1 mM,
pH 8; EGTA 1 mM; NaF 50 mM; β-glycerophosphate-Na 1 mM; sodium pir-
ophosphate 5 mM; orthovanadate-Na 1 mM; sucrose 0.27 M; PMSF 0.1 mM, β-
mercaptoethanol 1 mM, aprotinin 10 µg/ml, and leupectin 5 µg/ml). Lysates were
separated by SDS-PAGE and incubated in a 1/1000 dilution with antibodies against
phospho-Akt (Thr308) antibody (Cell Signalling Technology cat# 9275s), phospho-
Akt (Ser473) antibody (Cell Signalling Technology cat# 9271s), Akt antibody (Cell

p38alpha antibody (C-20) (Santa Cruz Biotechnology cat# sc-535), monoclonal
anti-vinculin (clone hVIN-1) antibody (Sigma-Aldrich cat# V9131), MKK6 poly-
clonal antibody (Stressgen Biotechnologies cat# ADI-KAP-MA014-E), or anti-
UCP1 antibody (Abcam cat# AB10983) all used at 1:1000, followed by an incu-
bation with a secondary antibody conjugated with horseradish peroxidase (HRP)
(1:5000). Reactive bands were detected by chemioluminiscence and quantified by
Image J software. Uncropped western blot images are shown in Supplementary
Fig. 10.
Histology staining. Fresh liver, white fat, and brown fat were fixed with formalin
10%, included in paraffin, and cut in 5-mm slides followed by a hematoxylin and
eosin staining. Adipocyte size was quantified using Image J software.
Fat droplets were detected by oil red staining (0.7% in propylenglycol) in 8-mm
slides included in OCT compound (Tissue-Tek©).
Glucose tolerance test. Starved overnight mice were injected i.p. with 1 g/kg of
glucose and blood glucose levels quantified by an Ascensia Breeze 2 glucose meter
at 0, 15, 30, 60, 90, and 120 min post injection.
Insulin tolerance test. Insulin tolerance test was performed injecting i.p.
0.75 IU/kg of insulin at mice starved 1 h and detecting blood glucose levels by a
glucometer at different time points post injection (0, 15, 30, 60, 90, and 120) as
indicated in the figure.
Insulin release and measurement. Mice were injected with 2 g/kg of glucose
and blood collected by submaxilar puncture at 0, 10, and 30 min after injection.
Insulin was quantified in serum by a multiplexed ELISA with a Luminex 200
analyser (Bio-Rad) following manufacture instructions.
Indirect calorimetry system. EE, respiratory exchange, locomotor activity, and
food intake were quantified using the indirect calorimetry system (TSE LabMaster,
TSE Systems, Germany) during 2 days.
Temperature. Body temperature was detected by a rectal thermometer (AZ
8851K/J/T Handheld Digital Thermometer-Single, AZ Instruments Corp., Taiwan).
BAT-adjacent interscapular temperature was quantified by thermographic
images using a FLIR® T430sc Infrared Camera (FLIR Systems, Inc., Wilsonville,
Oregon) and analyzed through FlirIR software.
Magnetic resonance imaging and NMR spectroscopy analysis. Fat mass was
analyzed by magnetic resonance imaging (whole body composition analyzer;
EchoMRI, Houston, TX, USA).
Spectroscopy examinations of WAT were performed in vivo on a 7T preclinical
system (Agilent Varian, Palo Alto, USA) equipped with a DD2 console and an
active shielded 205/120 gradient insert coil with 130 mT/m maximum strength.
Double-tuned circular transmit/receive coil were used for phosphorus/proton
(20 mm), placed over the epididymal fat and BAT (Rapid Biomedical GmBH,
Rimpar Germany).
Proton NMR spectra were acquired by 128 transients with 2048 complex points
with a spectral bandwidth of 10 kHz and a repetition time of 1.2 ms. Spectra were
acquired with adiabatic radiofrequency pulses to improve sensitivity and minimize
spectral distortions with an Ernst flip angle. Chemical shifts were expressed relative
to the water signal (4.7–4.8 p.p.m.) in 1H-MRS and phosphocreatine (0 p.p.m.) in
31P-MRS. Signals in NMR spectra were determined quantitatively by integration
after automatic or manual baseline correction, with fitting of each peak of the
spectrum (after phase and baseline correction) to a Lorentzian function using the
Mestrenova program (Mestrelab Research, Santiago de Compostea, Spain; released
2015-02-04 version:10.0.1-14719) on a Macintosh computer. An exponential line
broadening (3 Hz for proton) was applied before Fourier transformation.
qRT-PCR. RNA of 1 mg extracted with RNeasy Plus Mini kit (Quiagen©) following
manufacture instructions, was transcribed to complementary DNA and qRT-PCR
performed using Fast Sybr Green probe (Applied Biosystems) and the appropriated
primers in the 7900 Fast Real Time thermocycler (Applied Biosystems). Relative
mRNA expression was normalized to Gapdh mRNA measured in each sample.
Alternatively, RT-PCR was performed using Fast TaqMan probe (Applied
Biosystems) and the appropriate TaqMan Assay (Applied Biosystems) in the 7900
Fast Real Time thermocycler. Relative mRNA expression was normalized to 18s
mRNA measured in each sample or to Hprt mRNA in thyroid analysis. Primers
and TaqMan Assays used are specified in Supplementary Table 2.
UCP1 immunostaining and confocal analysis. For UCP1 immunostaining, fresh
fat depots were fixed with formalin 10%, included in paraffin, cut in 5-mm slides,
and sequentially stained with a UCP1 antibody (1/500, Abcam cat# AB10983),
a biotinylated goat anti-rabbit secondary antibody (1/500, Jackson Immuno
Research Laboratories), a streptavidin-conjugated ABC complex, and the sub-
strate 3,3′-diaminobenzidene conjugated with horseradish peroxidase (Vector
Laboratories cat# PK-6100), followed by brief counterstaining with Nuclear Fast
Red hematoxylin (Sigma).
Alternatively, adipocytes were stained with UCP1 primary antibody (1/500,
Abcam cat# AB10983) together with a fluorescent goat anti-rabbit secondary
antibody (Invitrogen), Bodipy (Invitrogen), and Dapi (Invitrogen) to study
UCP1 expression. Images were captured using a Leica SPE confocal microscope
(Leica Microsystems, Wetzlar, Germany).
To analyze mitochondria organization, adipocytes were stained with Mito
Tracker Deep Red (Invitrogen) and Bodipy (Invitrogen).
Mitochondria morphology analysis. Fresh fat depots of 1 mm2 were fixed with a
mix of paraformaldheyde 4% and glutaraldheyde 2% in 0.4 M hepes buffer for 4 h
at 4 °C. Once fixed, samples were washed with 0.4 M hepes buffer and analyzed in a
transmission electronic microscope (JEOL 1230) associated to a TVIPS CMOS 4K
camera. Pictures were obtained at 80 kV.
Chromatin immunoprecipitation assay. Immortalized white pre-adipocytes from
WT and Mkk6−/− mice were differentiated to adipocytes for 9 days and processed
to extract chromatin according to SimpleChIP® Plus Kit from Cell Signalling.
Chromatin was immunoprecipitated with a THRα/THRβ antibody (C3) (Ther-
moScientific cat# MA1-215), and, after elution and purification, DNA analyzed by
qRT-PCR using UCP1 enhancer primers (fw: TCTACAGCGTCACAGAGGGT, rv:
TGATTTCTGCTCTTCTGGCA) and control primers against RPL30 intron
2 supplied by SimpleChIP® Plus Kit. Results are expressed as % of input.
Hormone circulating levels measurement. T3, T4, and TSH were quantified in
serum by a multiplexed ELISA with a Luminex 200 analyser (Bio-Rad) following
manufacture instructions.
