SUMMARY
Influenza is a worldwide health and financial burden
posing a significant risk to the immune-compro-
mised, obese, diabetic, elderly, and pediatric popu-
lations. We identified increases in glucose meta-
bolism in the lungs of pediatric patients infected
with
respiratory
pathogens.
Using
quantitative
mass spectrometry, we found metabolic changes
occurring after influenza infection in primary human
respiratory cells and validated infection-associated
increases in c-Myc, glycolysis, and glutaminolysis.
We confirmed these findings with a metabolic drug
screen
that
identified
the
PI3K/mTOR
inhibitor
BEZ235 as a regulator of infectious virus production.
BEZ235 treatment ablated the transient induction of
c-Myc, restored PI3K/mTOR pathway homeostasis
measured by 4E-BP1 and p85 phosphorylation, and
reversed infection-induced changes in metabolism.
Importantly, BEZ235 reduced infectious progeny
but had no effect on the early stages of viral replica-
tion. BEZ235 significantly increased survival in mice,
while reducing viral titer. We show metabolic reprog-
ramming of host cells by influenza virus exposes
targets for therapeutic intervention.
INTRODUCTION
Influenza A virus (IAV) is a segmented RNA virus that buds off the
cell taking host proteins and lipids. IAV co-opts transcriptional
and translational machinery to favor viral protein production,
while undergoing antigenic drift and reducing vaccine efficacy.
Additionally, in the absence of host targeted therapies, the cur-
rent frontline therapy of neuraminidase inhibitors has been met
with a rise in viral resistance (Li et al., 2015). These factors
converge to reduce IAV antiviral therapeutic efficacy and neces-
sitate annual vaccine formulations that are not always effective
(Hue et al., 2002).
IAV replication predominantly occurs in respiratory epithelial
cells causing local pathologic changes and initiating a systemic
immune response that can contribute to poor outcomes. Im-
mune cell responses to influenza are well documented, while hu-
man respiratory epithelial cells remain less well characterized
(Legge and Braciale, 2003; Oshansky and Thomas, 2012;
Sanders et al., 2013). Metabolic requirements in pathological
processes have also been a topic of recent investigation, with
a view toward therapeutic intervention. Increased glucose and
glutamine metabolism links tumors and proliferating T cells,
which share a need for ongoing macromolecular synthesis and
replication (Marsin et al., 2002). Intriguingly, these metabolic
shifts also regulate effector T cell function (Chang et al., 2013;
Pearce, 2010; Pearce et al., 2009). Despite the recent focus on
immune metabolism, little is known about the metabolics of
airway epithelia in response to infection. Human cytomegalo-
virus increases glycolysis, glutaminolysis, and lipid production
by encoding viral proteins that direct metabolic change (Isler
et al., 2005; Munger et al., 2008; Vastag et al., 2011; Yu et al.,
2011a, 2011b). However, IAV is a much smaller RNA virus that
mediates acute infections with no identified proteins directly
regulating metabolism. In this study, we investigated the poten-
tial for the influenza virus to alter host metabolism.
We performed a retrospective study of children diagnosed
with respiratory viral infections and found elevated glucose up-
take in their lungs. To determine if this effect was related to viral
infection and to facilitate identification of molecular mechanisms
coordinating the host response, we conducted quantitative pro-
teomics in infected normal primary human bronchial epithelial
(NHBE) cells from pediatric donors. We found a unique virus-
associated metabolic program in NHBEs that was enriched for
glycolysis and glutaminolysis, required viral replication, and
was distinct from Toll-like receptor (TLR) stimulation. This finding

 led us to design a high-throughput metabolic drug screen, which
identified putative cellular targets required for productive infec-
tion and some potential therapeutic compounds. One drug,
BEZ235, reduced viral titers in vivo and significantly enhanced
survival after sublethal infection, without altering early viral repli-
cation kinetics, but instead altering host cell metabolic pheno-
types. Proteomic and network analysis facilitated discovery of
several influenza-induced metabolic changes, providing insights
for targeted drug screening leading to the identification of prom-
ising therapeutic compounds.
Figure 1. Glucose Uptake in Pediatric Pa-
tients Infected with Respiratory Viral Infec-
tions
(A–C) Patients with normal blood glucose were
given 5.5 MBq/kg FDG intravenously after fasting
R4 hr, followed by 1 hr inactivity and image cap-
ture with transmission CT and PET obtained from
the top of the skull to the feet.
(A) We identified 20 respiratory virus-PCR positive
pediatric patients retrospectively who received
positron emission tomography (PET) scans. Linear
regression compared the slopes of the PCR pos-
itive or negative patients over time to zero with the
slope of the PCR positive line showing significant
deviation from zero (p = 0.0189). A significant
relationship between FDG uptake and time of
clinical PCR diagnosis with respiratory viral infec-
tion was found in these patients by Spearman’s
correlation (rs = �0.59, number of XY pairs = 15,
p = 0.0221).
(B) Patient 10, a 4-year-old female, tested PCR
positive and underwent CT/PET scanning 3 days
post infection diagnosis and 2 months later
(Influenza Cleared).
(C) Standardized uptake values of FDG were
determined by placing regions-of-interest over
areas of normal and abnormal uptake in the lungs
for densitometry analysis. The mean, minimum,
maximum, and median densities are indicated
with the ROI size (i.e., diameter and area). Where
influenza negative ROI 1–4 are from the influenza
cleared lungs 2 months post initial diagnosis,
influenza positive 1–4 and 5–7 are from scans
1 and 2, respectively, of patient 10 3 days post
PCR positive diagnosis for influenza A. The Mann-
Whitney U test was used to determine significance
(i.e., p values for mean = 0.037 and median = 0.03)
with n = 20.

RESULTS
Metabolic Increase in the Lungs of
Respiratory-Virus-Infected
Patients
We performed a retrospective study of
positron
emission
tomography
(PET)
scans from 20 pediatric cancer patients
diagnosed with respiratory viral infections
by PCR (in clinic), several of which
showed increased glucose uptake in tu-
mor free lungs (Table S1). A strong negative monotonic relation-
ship (rs = �0.59, n = 15, p = 0 0.0198) between glucose uptake
and respiratory viral infection was found in these patients by
Spearman’s correlation (Figure 1A). There were 70% of patients
scanned 0–3 days after diagnosis by PCR that showed lung up-
take of glucose (Table S1). Images from three infected patients
are provided (Figures 1 and S1). One representative patient
from this group (patient 10), a 4-year-old female with leukopenia
from chemotherapy had a series of PET scans and was selected
for in-depth analysis (Figures 1B and 1C).

 Representative images from PET and CT scans of patient 10
show healthy lung tissue (Figure 1B, top row). In contrast, during
influenza infection, the lung CT scans show multiple nodular pul-
monary densities and interstitial fluid densities (Figure 1B). The
PET scan shows dark patches, with high signal in the dense
walled areas, as well as diffuse FDG uptake in the infected lungs
(Figure 1B). Glucose uptake in the IAV-infected lungs was signif-
icantly higher (p = 0.03) than PCR negative virus cleared lungs
from the follow-up scan 8 weeks later (Figure 1C). Prior to the
PET scan, 5 days of chemotherapy (i.e., cyclophosphamide
and topotecan) depleted the patient’s immune cells. Virtually
all blood cell subtypes’ absolute values were low or absent (Ta-
ble S2). White blood cell (WBC) counts, hemoglobin, hematocrit
percent, and platelet counts were nearing critical levels with low
WBC morphology and red blood cell mean corpuscular volume
(Table S2). The absence of band cells was notable, as one would
expect increases in an infected patient. The low immune cell
counts suggest the increased glucose uptake was not due to im-
mune cell proliferation alone. Together, these data suggest that
the influenza virus induces increased glucose uptake in human
lungs that is resolved temporally as the virus is cleared (Figures
1A–1C and S1; Table S1).
Influenza Infection Induces Significant Global Changes
in Metabolic Proteins
To identify molecular mechanisms coordinating this metabolic in-
crease in infected patients’ lungs, we conducted an unbiased
global quantification of host proteins using mass spectrometry
with iTRAQ labeling (Figure S2A). The responses in primary
epithelial cells derived from the upper respiratory tract of two
healthy young male donors were assessed, following 17 hr of
in vitro infection with one MOI of a human H1N1 influenza virus
pandemic
strain
(A/California/04/2009
[CA04]).
The
entire
NHBE proteome (soluble and insoluble fractions ± infection) is
publicly available at the Proteomics Identifications (PRIDE) re-
pository (PRIDE: PXD006265). FASP digestion and membrane
separation vastly expanded proteomic coverage, mainly in the
insoluble fraction (Figure S2B). We found infection-induced
metabolicpathways dominateenrichment categories (Figure2A).
Confidently identified peptides with 2-fold or greater abundance
changes were significantly enriched inglycolysis, TCA cycle, fatty
acid metabolism, oxidative phosphorylation, and pentose phos-
phate pathway (Figure 2A; Table S3). After in silico combination of
the soluble and insoluble proteomes, fold changes among these
pathways remained significant (Figure 2B). Metabolic pathway
coverage was extensive, with specific protein fold changes indi-
cated along with overall connectivity of the enriched categories in
Figure 2C. These results are consistent with dramatically altered
global metabolism following influenza infection.
Influenza Infection Increases Metabolic Flux, Distinct
from TLR Activation, Inducing Glucose and Glutamine
Dependence to Sustain Host Cell Viability
To validate the virus-induced metabolic changes in the patient
lungs and human proteome, we monitored metabolite flux with
the Seahorse XFe Analyzer (Agilent). Consistent with the PET
scans and proteome, IAV infected NHBE cells had significant in-
creases in metabolic flux (i.e., extracellular acidification rate
[ECAR] from lactate production, oxygen consumption rate
[OCR], and proton production rate [PPR]) (Figures 3A–3C). We
also found glucose uptake markedly increased with IAV infection
(Figure 3D). Previously, Ritter et al. (2010) found IAV infection
elevated glycolysis in MDCK cells. We too noted abnormally
high glycolysis in MDCK irrespective of infection and distinct
from NHBE (data not shown). This makes good sense, as
elevated metabolism is the hallmark of transformed cells like
MDCK. Thus, in all independent assays performed on primary
human epithelial cultures, we find gross metabolic changes in
keeping with our observation that respiratory infection increases
glycolytic metabolism in children’s lungs.
One explanation for the changes in NHBE metabolism is the
activation of host cell response systems. We monitored meta-
bolic flux after TLR agonist treatment to determine if the meta-
bolic reprogramming is dependent on productive infection or is
the result of activation of signaling cascades. Stimulation
through TLR3, 4, or 7/8 by polyinosinic polycytidylic acid
(PolyIC), lipopolysaccharide (LPS), or agonist R848 altered
NHBE metabolism. However, these alterations were significantly
different from IAV (Figures 3A–3C). PolyIC is structurally similar
to IAV RNA, yet it produced a metabolic profile distinct from influ-
enza infection (Figures 3A–3C). Glucose uptake was significantly
higher in infected cells compared to TLR treatment, another indi-
cation the metabolic reprogramming was not simply an attribute
of pathogen recognition (Figure 3D).
To further dissect the molecular mechanisms underpin-
ning these global changes, we used b-propriolactone (BPL)
Figure 2. Metabolic Pathways Dominate Host-Cell Changes after Influenza Virus Infection
(A–C) NHBE cells from one donor were expanded for 10 days and monolayers were infected with CA04 (MOI 1 pfu for 17 hr) in two separate experiments. The
lysates were collected on ice, homogenized in ammonium bicarbonate, and separated into soluble and insoluble fractions, iTRAQ-labeled, FASP digested,
desalted with C18 SPE, and analyzed with a Velos Orbitrap mass spectrometer. All confidently identified peptides with 2-fold or greater abundance changes were
input into DAVID for enrichment analysis (using Human background).

 inactivation to crosslink viral RNA. This permits entry, while pre-
venting replication, allowing one to distinguish between cell-
mediated responses to entry and metabolic reprogramming for
viral replication (Jonges et al., 2010). The metabolic flux trend
associated with BPL inactivated CA04 infection was similar to
active virus, but was significantly lower in magnitude (Figures
3A and 3C). These data suggest that some of the metabolic ef-
fects observed in IAV-infected cells are likely initiated by cell-
mediated responses to viral entry, but require viral replication
to reinforce and amplify the metabolic changes.
c-Myc is a transcription factor and master regulator of cellular
metabolism associated with cancer metabolism (Dang, 1999;
Dang et al., 1999; Lin et al., 2009). Consistent with c-Myc medi-
ated metabolic reprogramming found in other systems (i.e.,
cancer cells or T cells), we find a transient increase in c-Myc
following influenza infection (Figure 3E). c-Myc inhibitor, a well-
described direct inhibitor of c-Myc, also known as 10058-F4
(Calbiochem), was used to determine if blocking c-Myc could
restore normal metabolic phenotype (Hammoudeh et al., 2009;
Rahl et al., 2010; Wang et al., 2015; Yin et al., 2003). Indeed,
while the inhibitor alone increased bioenergetics, in the context
of IAV infection, c-Myc inhibitor reduced both ECAR and OCR
to near normal levels in a dose dependent manner that were
significantly lower than infection alone (Figures 3F and 3G).
c-Myc mediated metabolic changes in cancer often lead to a
state of glucose and glutamine addiction, where cells become
reliant on excesses of these substrates to survive. We tested
the viability of infected NHBE with glucose and glutamine restric-
tion and found IAV infection significantly reduced the viability in
this context (Figure 3H). Influenza infection induces a transient
increase in c-Myc that correlates with changes in metabolism
that are modulated by c-Myc inhibition and may contribute to
metabolite requirements that are critical for infected NHBE cell
survival.

Figure 3. Metabolic Reprogramming by Influenza Confirmed and Distinct from TLR Stimulation
(A–C) NHBE cells were grown and differentiated in 24-well Seahorse plates and left untreated (control), infected for 17 hr at MOI 1 with either viable virus or a
b-propriolactone-inactivated virus (CA04 or BPL, respectively), or stimulated with TLR agonists lipopolysaccharide (LPS), polyinosinic polycytidylic acid (PolyIC),
or Resiquimod (R848). After treatment, the extracellular acidification rate (ECAR), oxygen consumption rate (OCR), and proton production rate (PPR) of NHBE
cells were monitored for 2 hr. The error bars represent standard error of the mean of quadruplicate (control and CA04) or triplicate (BPL, LPS, PolyIC, and R848)
samples, representative data from three independent experiments. The basal rate was established by measuring technical replicates measured 13 times/per well
to establish basal rate giving n = 52 (control and CA04) or n = 39 (BPL, LPS, PolyIC, and R848) for SEM.
(D) NHBE cells were treated as in (A)–(C) and glucose uptake was monitored using a standard blood glucometer in two independent experiments, in quadruplicate
with SEM.
(E) NHBE cells were infected with CA04 for up to 17 hr at MOI 1, harvested at indicated time, and lysates subjected to immunoblotting with a c-Myc protein
standard from cMyc positive tumor lysate (‘‘ctrl’’) and probed for c-Myc and b-actin.
(F and G) NHBE cells were grown and differentiated in 96-well Seahorse plates and left untreated (control), infected for 17 hr with CA04 viable virus at MOI 1,
treated with cMyc inhibitor at 0.5 mM, 1.0 mM, and 2.0 mM, respectively, or infected and treated. After treatment, the ECAR and OCR of NHBE cells were monitored
for 2 hr. The error bars represent standard error of the mean of quintuplicate (control and CA04) and (cMyc 2.0 mM and CA04 + 2.0 mM) samples, representative
plate from five independent experiments. The basal rate was established by measuring technical replicates measured 12 times per well to establish basal rate
giving n = 60 (control, CA04, cMyc 2.0 mM, and CA04 + 2.0 mM) for SEM.
(H) BGEM was replaced with complete DMEM (red dotted line) or metabolite deplete DMEM for 2–4 hr, followed by infection for 17 hr when viability was assessed
using trypan blue exclusion. There were two independent experiments that were done with each control and virus in triplicate.
(B–H) Error bars reflect the SEM and significances are indicated as *p % 0.05, **p % 0.001, ***p % 0.0001, and ****p < 0.0001 from a Dunnett’s multiple com-

 infection) monitoring two endpoints: NHBE cell death and viral
titer (Figure 4A). Table S4 provides a selected subset of the
most active compounds. The NHBE viability curve data and cor-
responding titer data from one representative screen are in Data
S1. Following the determination of NHBE cell viability in
response to varying drug concentrations (ten point dose
response), we titered IAV from each concentration of drug with
both treatment modalities. The high-throughput viral titer was
done on MDCK cells with cytopathic effect (CPE) of the infection
monitored using a CellTiter-Glo viability assay. The area under
the curve (AUC) for each titer was calculated and the average
AUC was then subjected to K-means clustering to facilitate the
selection of 23 drugs (Figure S3A).
The selected compounds were then subjected to traditional
TCID50 titering. There were eight compounds that significantly
reduced CPE with pretreatment; half of which block lipid
metabolism: FABP4, pioglitazone, a-mangostin, and clotrima-
zole (Figure S3B). There were five compounds that showed a
significant decrease in viral titer following therapeutic treat-
ment, one of which targets glucose metabolism (Figure S3C).
The competitive inhibitor 2-Deoxy-D-glucose (2-DG) was in-
cluded as an internal control to determine if the workflow could
identify a known glycolytic inhibitor and to test our hypothesis
that glycolysis is necessary for IAV replication. Indeed, while
2-deoxy-glucose is not a viable therapeutic option (Raez et al.,
2013), it demonstrates the efficacy of this workflow and bolsters
our confidence in the drug screen.
Of the validated drug hits, BEZ235, clotrimazole, and a-man-
gostin were selected for further study based on their differential
effects on infected NHBE cell survival and consistent reduction
in viral titers (Figures 4B, 4F, 4J, and S3B; Table S4). BEZ235,
a PI3K/mTOR dual inhibitor known to induce insulin resistance
in vivo, significantly reduced viral titer (Figure 4J) (Smith et al.,
2012). The other two drugs displaying similar profiles were clotri-
mazole, a topical treatment for fungal infections that targets lipid
metabolism and a-mangostin, a known anti-viral effective
against other RNA viruses (Chen et al., 1996; Choi et al., 2014;
Shaneyfelt et al., 2006; Vlietinck et al., 1998). In keeping with
our previous results with the first human donor, viral infection
induced increases in metabolite flux (ECAR, OCR, and PPR) in
a second NHBE donor (Figures 4C–4E, 4G–4I, and 4K–4M). Of
the three drugs tested, BEZ235 was the only drug to reverse
influenza induced metabolic flux to untreated levels (Figures

Mechanism of BEZ235
BEZ235
has
been
extensively
characterized
as
a
dual
PI3K/mTOR inhibitor in transformed cell lines to facilitate its
development as a cancer treatment. We sought to determine
the activity of this inhibitor in primary NHBE. First, we performed
label-free shotgun proteomics on NHBE, NHBE treated with
BEZ235, and infected NHBE treated with BEZ235 (PRIDE:
PXD006263). Figure S4 and Table S5 show the major pathways
altered by BEZ235 treatment. In both infected and uninfected
conditions, the strongest effects of BEZ treatment were on meta-
bolic pathways. BEZ235 largely downregulated metabolic tar-
gets, consistent with its reported activity; in particular PI3K and
mTOR pathways were significantly downregulated (Table S5).
Few proteins were upregulated in response to treatment and
these were also largely metabolic.
To validate the results of the proteomic measurements and
establish the kinetics of activation of PI3K and mTOR pathways
after IAV infection, we tested a number of metabolic mediators
by immunoblotting (Figure 5A). After infection, 4E-BP1and
PI3K (p85) are phosphorylated, indicating activation of the
PI3K and mTOR pathways (Figure 5A). 70S6K (S371 and T389)
and S6 (S235/236) are initially phosphorylated in uninfected
cells, while 70S6K (T389) and S6 (S235/236) are dephosphory-
lated by 17 hr after infection (Figure 5A). Treatment with
BEZ235 perturbs viral induction of the PI3K/mTOR pathways,
as is demonstrated by reduced PI3K and mTOR levels
and
phosphorylation
products
[p85(Y458)/p55(Y199)
and
mTORC1(S2448), respectively] compared to infection alone (Fig-
ure 5A, and consistent with the proteomic results, see Table S5).
70S6K (T389) and 4E-BP1 phosphorylation are abolished by
BEZ235,
consistent
with
mTORC1
inhibition
(Figure
5A).
BEZ235 treatment also leads to a time dependent decrease in
protein and phosphorylation levels of the mTORC1 component
and substrate PRAS40 (Figure 5A).
We sought to determine if these mTOR/PI3K pathway
changes and BEZ235-mediated restoration of metabolic flux
correlated to changes in cMyc levels. BEZ235 treatment is
known to block c-Myc induction via inhibition of p70S6K and
eIF4B (Csibi et al., 2014; Duffy et al., 2014). Likewise, we see
that the transient increase in cMyc expression induced by influ-
enza infection is ablated by BEZ235 treatment in both NHBE do-
nors (Figure 5B). Akt and PI3K inhibitors can block viral entry in
transformed cell lines (Hirata et al., 2014; Shin et al., 2007). Pre-
venting viral entry could explain reduced viral titer, c-Myc
expression, and altered PI3k/mTOR activity. We measured the
production of viral M-gene levels in infected NHBE cells to deter-
mine the kinetics of viral entry, transcript production, and
genome replication in BEZ235-treated cells. BEZ235 treatment
had no effect on new viral transcript accumulation, indicating
that viral entry, polymerase activity, and genome replication
were intact (Figure 5C). Thus, BEZ235’s replication blockade oc-
curs after these initiating events.
Next, we examined how IAV infection and BEZ235 treatment
modulate substrates fueling the infection by inhibiting glucose
entry into glycolysis with 2-DG and pyruvate, palmitate, and
glutamine entrance into the mitochondria with UK5099, eto-
moxir, or BPTES, respectively. Figure 5D summarizes the rates
measured and inhibitors used in the Seahorse XF Glycolysis
Stress Test and Seahorse XF Mito Fuel Flex Test (Agilent). The
glycolysis stress test begins with establishing basal ECAR levels
followed by injection of 10 mM glucose to determine the increase
in glycolysis at saturating substrate concentrations (glucose
induced response). Next, mitochondrial ATP production is in-
hibited with 1 mM oligomycin, to shift the cell’s energy production
to glycolysis, resulting in maximal ECAR (glycolytic capacity)
followed by glycolysis inhibition by 50 mM 2-DG treatment.
We find the glycolytic capacity of NHBE was significantly
increased by IAV infection (Figure 5E). Likewise, the addition of
the glucose substrate resulted in a significant increase in
ECAR in the IAV-infected cells (Figure 5E). BEZ235 treatment
significantly reduced both the glycolytic capacity and glucose

(A) Timeline of drug treatment, infection, and titer.
(B, F, and J) Drugs acting on lipid metabolism (green), PI3K/mTOR (red), and vehicle controls (black). NHBE cells were seeded in BEGM medium rested and then
infected at �17 hr or +12 hr, drug treatment at 0 hr, and supernatant removed at 72 hr to recapitulate drug screen conditions. The viral laden supernatant removed
from the drug dose response curves were then titrated to eight serial dilutions on confluent MDCK cells, and the infection was allowed to proceed, in the presence
of TPCK trypsin, for 72 hr. The cytopathic effect was determined by staining remaining MDCK cells with crystal violet, followed by three rinses with water. Each
viral titer was performed in triplicate and calculated with the Reed-Muench method. The vehicle was titered eight times and a-mangostin was titered seven times
(B), clotrimazole was titered three times (F), and BEZ235 was titered seven times (J) (each in triplicate) corresponding to three separate experiments, error bars
reflect SEM. The statistical differences in titer values between drug treatments were assessed using paired t test with p % 0.0001 (***) and p < 0.0001 (****).
(C–E, G–I, and K–M) NHBE cells were seeded in XF24 Seahorse cell culture plates, rested for 4–8 hr, and treated with vehicle or 10 nM BEZ235 (K–M), clotri-
mazole, (G–I), or a-mangostin (C–E) in NMP/PEG (1:9), peanut oil, or DMSO/PBS (1:10), respectively, for 4 hr followed by infection at one MOI with CA04, where
each drug treatment was in triplicate wells per plate, one plate per experiment in two separate experiments. At 17 hr later, plates were processed and read on
Seahorse following manufacturer’s protocol. The basal levels were established after six measurements, at approximately 1 hr. The error bars reflect the error of
the mean calculated with n = 6. The significance compared to CA04 treatment with Tukey’s multiple comparison adjusted t test that followed ANOVA (< 0.0001).
Adjusted p values from this test are as follows: *p % 0.05, **p % 0.01, ***p % 0.001, and ****p < 0.0001.

 induced response, thereby abolishing the utilization of one major
metabolic fuel needed in IAV infection (Figure 5E).
The Mito Fuel Flex Test determines cellular dependence on
each metabolite to fuel mitochondrial respiration and the capac-
ity for utilizing each substrate when the others are blocked. We
found infection had very little impact on NHBE mitochondrial
dependence on pyruvate import into the mitochondria or capac-
ity for import when fatty acid oxidation and glutaminolysis were
both inhibited (Figure 5F). As one would expect, in contrast to py-
ruvate, NHBE reliance on glutamine to fuel oxygen consumption
was lower. However, the dependence of the NHBE on glutamine
as a metabolic substrate doubles with infection (Figure 5G).
Similar to glucose, we find BEZ235 limits glutamine oxidation
of infected cells to normal levels (Figure 5G). Oxygen consump-
tion from beta oxidation of fatty acids is relatively low, with infec-
tion having little impact (Figure 5H). Taken together, we find that
infection increases cellular dependence on glucose and gluta-
mine to fuel metabolism and treatment with BEZ235 limits utiliza-
tion of these fuels.
BEZ235 Rescues Mice from Lethal Influenza Infection,
Reduces Viral Titer, and Ameliorates Respiratory
Distress
To test the efficacy of these drugs in vivo, 10- to 12-week-old fe-
male C57/BL6 mice were orally administered vehicle or drug
daily for 1 week. Mice were infected intranasally with CA04 at
an infectious dose of 103 EID50, after which respiratory parame-
ters and weight losses were monitored for 15 days (Figure 6A).
Clotrimazole and a-mangostin had little effect on the course of
disease (Figures S5A and S5B). BEZ235 had no effect on weight
loss (Figure 6B) and there were no signs of toxicity in blood
chemistry analyses (data not shown). However, BEZ235 treated
mice showed a profound improvement in survival following lethal
infection with the CA04 influenza virus (Figure 6C).
BEZ235 consistently reduced viral titer in vitro (Figures 4J and
S3B; Table S4). In keeping with these findings, BEZ235 signifi-
cantly reduced lung titers in vivo 4 days after influenza infection
(Figure 6D). Lung function is the primary pathologic impairment
in influenza infection. Lung function (assessed by whole-body
plethysmography [WBP]) was previously used to determine the
efficacy of antivirals against influenza (Julander et al., 2011;
Sanders et al., 2013). With WBP, we find BEZ235 significantly
reduced mid-expiratory tidal flow compared to vehicle treated
animals (Figure 6E). A reduction in this parameter of lung function
is notable, as we have previously shown it strongly correlates
with IAV infection survival outcomes (Julander et al., 2011;
Sanders et al., 2013). In NHBE cells, BEZ235 reduces viral titer,
restores metabolic function, restricts aberrant activation of the
PI3K/mTOR pathway, and reduces c-Myc expression to normal
levels, while limiting glucose and glutamine utilization (Figures
4J–4M and 5). In vivo BEZ235 reduces influenza-induced mortal-
ity, decreases viral titer, augments respiratory function in

independent experiments in separate 96-well plates with each treatment in 4–12 replicate wells. The error bars reflecting standard error of the mean, with ANOVA
(< 0.0001) to distinguish differences among group means and treatment with post analysis by Dunnett’s multiple comparisons adjusted t test of significance in
comparison to CA04 (**** = p < 0.0001).
(E) NHBE were equilibrated in non-buffered DMEM with glutamine (2 mM) for 1 hr then ECAR kinetic reads taken in 6.22 min intervals with maximal rate measured
after three reads followed by injection. The basal ECAR was determined then 10 mM glucose was injected followed by 1 mM oligomycin (to inhibit oxidative
phosphorylation) with glycolytic capacity calculated by subtracting the basal ECAR from the maximal rate following both injections. The glucose induced
response was calculated by subtracting the basal ECAR from the maximal ECAR after glucose injection. Untreated n = 7, CA04 n = 8, CA04 + BEZ235 n = 8, and
BEZ235 n = 8 for SEM.

with sequential injections of both 4 mM etomoxir and 3 mM BPTES, followed by 2 mM UK5099, respectively. The percent dependence on pyruvate was calculated
from the difference in basal OCR and pyruvate blocked OCR divided by basal OCR less OCR after all FA and glutamine import were blocked with sequential
injections of 2 mM UK5099, followed by a combined 4 mM etomoxir and 3 mM BPTES, respectively. Untreated n = 11, CA04 n = 10, CA04 + BEZ235 n = 8, and
BEZ235 n = 9 for SEM.
(G) Percent capacity to use glutamine for respiration was calculated by dividing OCR from glutamine alone by OCR with pyruvate, FA, and glutamine import
inhibited with sequential injections of both 4 mM etomoxir and 2 mM UK5099, followed by 3 mM BPTES, respectively. The percent dependence on glutamine was
calculated from the difference in basal OCR and glutamine blocked OCR divided by basal OCR less OCR after all FA and pyruvate import were blocked with
sequential injections of 3 mM BPTES, followed by both 4 mM etomoxir and 2 mM UK5099, respectively. Untreated n = 11, CA04 n = 10, CA04 + BEZ235 n = 8, and
BEZ235 n = 9 for SEM.
(H) Percent capacity to use fatty acids for respiration was calculated by dividing OCR from fatty acids alone by OCR with pyruvate, FA, and glutamine import
inhibited with sequential injections of both 3 mM BPTES and 2 mM UK5099, followed by 4 mM etomoxir, respectively. The percent dependence on fatty acids was
calculated from the difference in basal OCR and fatty acid blocked OCR divided by basal OCR less OCR after all fatty acid, glutamine, and pyruvate import
were blocked with sequential injections of 4 mM etomoxir, followed by both 3 mM BPTES and 2 mM UK5099, respectively. Untreated n = 11, CA04 n = 12,

 infected adult mice, and is well tolerated (Figures 6C–6E). Thus,
influenza induced changes in host metabolism represent viable
drug targets to ameliorate disease severity and infection induced
mortality.
DISCUSSION
Using preexisting patient data combined with the human bron-
chial epithelium proteome, we identified a dramatic shift in meta-
bolic pathway activity after influenza infection. The increase in
glycolysis and glutaminolysis were validated with metabolic
flux analyses and functional assays. This reprogramming is
consistent with the fact that each budding virus depletes cellular
resources (lipids, proteins, and a small amount of nucleic acid)
that need to be replaced to maintain cellular homeostasis. These
changes in metabolism within infected primary cells can be seen
as a fight for limited macromolecules fueling competing inter-
ests. Indeed, the substrates, energy, and products required for
biomass in viral replication are also critical for the host response
to infection. Glucose and glutamine are abundant substrates in
the plasma that provide a nearly unlimited source of renewable
energy for infected cells (Newsholme et al., 1985). Given the sig-
nificant increases in glycolysis in NHBE cells as well as patients’
lungs, substrate availability does not appear to limit the meta-
bolic program induced by viral infection. Influenza viral budding
removes significant amounts of amino acids and fatty acids from
the intracellular milieu, thereby preventing normal feedback inhi-
bition by metabolic product buildup. Together, unlimited sub-
strate availability (glutamine and glucose) and gross product
export (lipids and proteins) enforce a ‘‘viral production’’ meta-
bolic state. This state appears to be at least in part dependent
on elevated levels of c-Myc, as c-Myc inhibition reverts the meta-
bolic profile of infected cells to an uninfected profile.
Identified from a large-scale screening of metabolic com-
pounds, we found that BEZ235 improved clinical outcomes of in-
fected animals and reduced viral titers in vitro and in vivo. While
BEZ235 alters glucose metabolism in vivo, it is primarily thought
to act via inhibition of PI-3 kinase isoforms and is currently in clin-
ical trials in combination with antitumor drugs (Smith et al., 2012).
Our proteomic data suggest BEZ235 largely affects metabolism,
indeed the PI3K-AKT-mTOR pathway was heavily modulated af-
ter treatment. Small interfering RNA (siRNA)-mediated knock
down of PI3K-AKT-mTOR host gene expression previously iden-
tified several genes in this pathway as potential therapeutic

(A) Daily drug treatment was started 48 hr before intranasal infection with CA04 and maintained for 7 days. Weight loss was checked daily, and respiratory
parameters were monitored via whole-body plethysmography on days 0, 2, 4, 7, and 10. A subset of mice was euthanized on day 4, and the lungs were harvested
for viral titers.
(B) Oral gavage of 200 mL of BEZ235 (25 mg/kg; red square) or vehicle (black circle) had no independent effect on weight loss. The error bars reflect standard error
of the mean from 45 mice per treatment from two independent experiments.
(C) BEZ235 treatment (red) dramatically improved survival. The error bars reflect standard error of the mean from 45 mice per treatment from two independent
experiments (p < 0.0001 by Mantel-Cox log rank test).
(D) Lungs were harvested, homogenized, and seeded on MDCK cells for titer assays; hemagglutination activity was determined with chicken red blood cells. The
viral titer was significantly lower in BEZ235-treated mice (red). The titer from four mice from each group was determined in triplicate per mouse (t test p = 0.0027).
(E) Mice underwent whole-body plethysmography with an equilibration time of 30 min followed by 5 min of data collection. The tidal flow of air at the mid-point of
expiration of four mice per treatment was monitored in two independent experiment groups, and t testing was used to determine statistical differences among
treatments, with p values indicated by asterisks (****p % 0.0001).

 targets and for influenza infection (Murray et al., 2012). However,
in spite of in vitro antiviral activity in this study, the mTOR inhibitor
everolimus had no effect in vivo (Murray et al., 2012). Hirata et al.
(2014) found by using a peptide inhibitor of Akt kinase, they could
suppress entry and replication of the mouse adapted PR8 virus
into the A549 cell line, in contrast to BEZ235, which we found
had no effect on entry and genome replication in human primary
epithelial cells (Figure 5C).
A transient dysregulation of glucose metabolism induced by
BEZ235, consistent with the alterations in metabolite flux,
glucose uptake, and blood amylase levels, may limit viral replica-
tion. Indeed, in vitro we see a reversion of global cellular meta-
bolism to normal levels and reduced glutamine dependence
induced by infection, provided infected cells are treated with
BEZ235. This reversion to normal metabolism occurred despite
high levels of viral genome replication. These data suggest that
the primary metabolic disruption by the influenza virus is inde-
pendent of genome replication; the significant depletion of lipid
membranes would seem to be a likely candidate. Future studies
will address how late into the course of influenza infection treat-
ment with BEZ235 remains effective. Also, a thorough analysis of
the drug’s effects on components of the adaptive immune sys-
tem would be useful to determine if treatment might limit memory
recall responses from B cells and T cells.
EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURES
Additional details of all experimental procedures and statistical analysis can be
found in the Supplemental Experimental Procedures section.
PET Scans of an Influenza-Virus-Infected Patient
The Institutional Review Board of St. Jude Children’s Research Hospital
approved the study, which was a retrospective analysis of data acquired for
diagnostic purposes on consented patients. PCR tests were performed in clin-
ical labs at St Jude. Blood glucose levels were tested and, if found to be
normal, the patients were given intravenous injections of 5.5 MBq/kg fluoro-
deoxyglucose (FDG; maximum, 444 MBq) after at least 4 hr of fasting. The pa-
tients were kept in a quiet, dark room after injection and were told to lie down
and relax with their arms at their sides. Approximately 1 hr later, attenuation
correction and lesion localization were acquired by using a GE Discovery LS
PET/CT system (GE Medical Systems) to capture transmission CT and PET im-
ages. The following CT parameters were: tube rotation, 0.8 s; slice thickness,
0.5 cm; table speed, 1.5 cm/rotation; pitch, 1.5:1; 120 kV; and 90 mA; with
dose modulation. PET images were obtained from the top of the skull to the
feet for 5 min per bed position in 2-dimensional mode. Anesthesia-sedation
was used if needed. Scans after July 2011 were acquired on a GE Discovery
690 PET/CT system. Those images were acquired in 3-dimensional mode
for 3–5 min per bed position. Vendor-supplied software was used for recon-
struction. Standardized uptake values were determined by placing regions-
of-interest over areas of normal and abnormal uptake in the lungs.
Institutional Permissions
The Institutional Review Board of St. Jude Children’s Research Hospital
approved the study, which was a retrospective analysis of data acquired for
diagnostic purposes on consented patients. All animal procedures were
approved by the St. Jude Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee (proto-
col number: 098), following the guidelines established by the Institute of Lab-
oratory Animal Resources, approved by the Governing Board of the United
States National Research Council.
Gender and Age
PET scans were performed on 20 children, eight female and 12 male. NHBE
were from young male donors (ages 3, 10, and 17). Female C57/BL6 mice
aged 6 to 8 weeks were used in infection studies due to the maturity of immune
response at this developmental stage.
Proteomics Sample Preparation, Mass Spectrometry, and Data
Processing
NHBE cells (Lonza) were infected for 17 hr with CA04 (MOI 1) followed by lysis,
homogenization, and fractionation by centrifugation. NHBE cells were de-
salted by C18 solid-phase extraction (SPE) before isobaric labeling (Supelco).
Digested samples were then processed according to the manufacturer’s
directions for iTRAQ 4-plex labeling (AB Sciex). Before fractionating via high-
pH reverse-phase fractionation with concatenated pooling, samples were
desalted by C18 SPE (Supelco). All samples were processed in a custom
liquid chromatography system using reversed-phase C18 columns. The iTRAQ
samples were analyzed by using a Velos Orbitrap Mass Spectrometer
(Thermo Scientific). Both systems were equipped with custom ion funnel-
based atmospheric pressure ionization sources and electrospray ionization
interfaces.
Raw files were compared with a concatenated NCBI human database and
contaminant database by using Sequest v.27 (rev. 12). The resulting sequence
identifications were rescored by using MS-GF and filtered to a 1% false dis-
covery rate by using the target-decoy approach and MS-GF-derived spectral
probabilities. Reporter-ion intensities were quantified by using the MASIC tool
(Monroe et al., 2008). Missing reporter ion channel results were excluded from
analysis. Redundant peptide identification reporter ions were summed across
fractions, and median central tendency normalization was used to account for
channel bias and then log2-transformed. Soluble and insoluble fractions were
analyzed separately by using DanteR software. The analysis of variance model
included treatment and peptide effects. The remaining treatment effect and p
value were calculated by using Student’s t test. Benjamini-Hochberg multiple-
testing error correction was applied to the results of this hypothesis testing,
and proteins having a p value % 0.05 were considered to be statistically
significant.
Metabolic Fuel Flux Assays
Glycolytic Stress and Mito Fuel Flex Tests were performed on XFe96 Bio-
analyzer (Agilent). At 16 hr post infection, all assays were performed
following manufacture’s protocols. Briefly, the Mito Fuel Flex Test inhibits
import of three major metabolic substrates (pyruvate, fatty acids, and/or
glutamine) with mitochondrial pyruvate carrier inhibitor UK5099 (2 mM),
carnitine palmitoyltransferase 1A inhibitor etomoxir (4 mM), or glutaminase
inhibitor BPTES (3 mM). This test determines cellular dependence on each
of metabolite to fuel mitochondrial metabolism by inhibiting the individual

 High-Throughput Drug Screening
The drug library included 80 compounds, FDA-approved drugs, and tool com-
pounds directed at well-known metabolic targets that were screened in NHBE
cells. The dose response of each drug was determined (4 nM to 10 mM) for its
use as a prophylactic treatment given 8 hr before CA04 infection (MOI = 1) and
its use as a therapeutic treatment given 17 hr after infection. After 72 hr, the
supernatant was removed for viral titer, and cell viability was determined by
performing
CellTiter-Glo
luminescent
cell
viability
assays
(Promega)
measuring ATP production. Raw data were log10-transformed, and the per-
centage of inhibition was estimated in relation to that of previously and empir-
ically determined controls (DMSO = negative control [0% cell death] and
cycloheximide = positive control [100% cell death]). Virus-laden supernatant
was added to confluent MDCK cells and titrated to eight serial dilutions or
three serial dilutions for uninfected controls (3 3 384-well plates per drug
were set up in triplicate for each of three conditions). After 72 hr, the cytopathic
effect was determined by using the CellTiter-Glo viability assay. Data process-
ing for the titer (171 3 384-well plates) was done by determining the area under
the curve for each titer. From these data, 23 compounds were selected for titer
validation by traditional TCID50 assays.
In Vivo Drug Tests
All animal procedures were approved by the St. Jude Institutional Animal Care
and Use Committee. Female C57/BL6 mice aged 6 to 8 weeks were given
either 0.2 mL oral gavage with BEZ235 at 25 mg/kg or 0.5 mL intraperitoneal
injections of either 120 mg/kg clotrimazole or 8 mg/kg a-mangostin, with
appropriate vehicle controls performed in littermates (Supplemental Experi-
mental Procedures). Mice were dosed daily for 7 days beginning 2 days before
infection and then monitored for signs of infection and weight loss daily for
15 days (no significant difference by t test). On days 0, 2, 4, 7, and 10, after
30 min of chamber equilibration time, respiratory parameters were monitored
for 5–10 min by performing whole-body plethysmography (Buxco). On day 4, a
subset of mice was euthanized for arterial blood and lung collection for blood
chemistry and complete blood count or titer. Lungs were homogenized and
subjected to TCID50 assays with hemagglutination titer readout, with signifi-
cance determined by t testing (p < 0.003). Moribund mice were euthanized
and survival percentage differences were calculated, with significance deter-
mined by Mantel-Cox log rank testing (p < 0.0001). There were 45 mice that
were included for each condition, more than doubling the total events needed
(21) to satisfy the following criteria: a (two-tailed) = 0.05, b = 0.20, q1 = 0.692,
and q0 = 0.308 with relative hazard ratio 3.776. Mice were excluded from an
isolated catastrophic cage failure altering survival patterns (e.g., cage flood-
ing); no randomization or blinding was used.
Statistics
Proteome
Redundant peptide identification reporter ions were summed across fractions
similar to a weighted average. Median central tendency normalization was
applied to account for channel bias associated with sample handling. The re-
sults were then log2 transformed. The processed results from the soluble and
insoluble fraction were analyzed separately using the DanteR software suite.
The ANOVA model applied consists of a treatment and peptide effect. This re-
moves the variance associated with each peptide for a given protein having
differing ionization efficiencies or due to the position on the elution profile
when a peptide is sent for fragmentation. The remaining treatment effect
and p value can then be calculated using a Student’s t test. The Benjamini-
Hochberg multiple-testing error correction was applied to the results of this hy-
pothesis testing and proteins having a p value of 0.05 or less were considered
significant. With the following predetermined exclusion criteria: Peptide to
spectrum matches were filtered at a 1% false discovery rate using a target-
decoy approach and MS-GF derived spectral probabilities as the scoring
metric. All peptides identified with missing reporter ion channel results were
removed from the analysis.
Enrichment Analysis
Peptide identifiers were input into DAVID for enrichment analysis, with signif-
icantly enriched Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG) path-
ways indicated (i.e., p value % 0.01), grouped by similarity (i.e., biosynthetic,
degradative, disease and immune response, metabolic or misc.), and enumer-
ated by fold enrichment. Fold enrichment significance is indicated with an
asterisk. Fold changes from the proteins identified in the glycolysis/gluconeo-
genesis and TCA cycle enriched KEGG pathways are graphed with identifica-
tion significance in the inset. Group enrichment score ranks the biological
significance of gene groups based on overall EASE scores of all enriched
annotation terms. Significance is indicated as *p % 0.05, **p % 0.001, and
***p % 0.0001, with the following predetermined exclusion criteria: Peptides
with <2-fold abundance changes were removed.
Basal Metabolic Rates, Glucose, Viability Assay, TCID50, Glycolysis
Stress Test, Mitochondrial Flex Fuel, and Lung Titer
ANOVA was used to distinguish differences among group means and treatment
with post analysis by Dunnett’s multiple comparisons adjusted t test of sig-
nificance in comparison to CA04. Asterisks represent p values following stan-
dard convention in all figures as follows: p < 0.05 (*), p < 0.01 (**), p < 0.001(***),
and p < 0.0001 (****). With the following predetermined exclusion criteria
(bioanalyzer): (1) injection failure, (2) bubbles in well, and (3) negative values.
qPCR and Plethysmography
ANOVA analysis was used with asterisks representing p values following stan-
dard convention in all figures as follows: p = 0.0069 (**) and p < 0.0001 (****).
