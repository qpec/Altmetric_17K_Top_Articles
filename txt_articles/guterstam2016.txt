To accurately localize our limbs and guide movements toward external objects, the brain must represent
the body and its surrounding (peripersonal) visual space. Specific multisensory neurons encode periper-
sonal space in the monkey brain, and neurobehavioral studies have suggested the existence of a similar
representation in humans. However, because peripersonal space lacks a distinct perceptual correlate, its
involvement in spatial and bodily perception remains unclear. Here, we show that applying brushstrokes
in mid-air at some distance above a rubber hand—without touching it—in synchrony with brushstrokes
applied to a participant’s hidden real hand results in the illusory sensation of a ‘‘magnetic force” between
the brush and the rubber hand, which strongly correlates with the perception of the rubber hand as one’s
own. In eight experiments, we characterized this ‘‘magnetic touch illusion” by using quantitative subjec-
tive reports, motion tracking, and behavioral data consisting of pointing errors toward the rubber hand in
an intermanual pointing task. We found that the illusion depends on visuo-tactile synchrony and exhibits
similarities with the visuo-tactile receptive field properties of peripersonal space neurons, featuring a
non-linear decay at 40 cm that is independent of gaze direction and follows changes in the rubber hand
position. Moreover, the ‘‘magnetic force” does not penetrate physical barriers, thus further linking this
phenomenon to body-specific visuo-tactile integration processes. These findings provide strong support
for the notion that multisensory integration within peripersonal space underlies bodily self-attribution.
Furthermore, we propose that the magnetic touch illusion constitutes a perceptual correlate of visuo-
tactile integration in peripersonal space.

1. Introduction
The space close to our hands does not ‘‘feel” different than the
space outside our reach. Nevertheless, a wealth of research has
demonstrated that the space surrounding the body has a special
representation in the brain. Single-unit recordings in monkeys
have identified neurons in specific areas in the frontal and parietal
association cortices that integrate visual, tactile, and propriocep-
tive signals (Hyvärinen & Poranen, 1974; Rizzolatti, Scandolara,
Matelli, & Gentilucci, 1981). These neurons feature visual receptive
fields (RFs) that extend up to 40 cm from the skin surface (Fogassi
et al., 1996), that are spatially anchored to the limb (and follow
changes in limb position) (Graziano, Hu, & Gross, 1997) and that
are independent of the direction of gaze (Graziano & Gross,
1998). Collectively, these populations of neurons build and main-
tain a multisensory representation of the body and its surrounding
(peripersonal) space that is considered to be important for
sensory-guided movements and limb localization (Graziano &
Botvinick, 2002). In humans, neuroimaging studies have found evi-
dence for the existence of a similar representation of the space
around the hand (Brozzoli, Gentile, & Ehrsson, 2012; Brozzoli,
Gentile, Petkova, & Ehrsson, 2011; Makin, Holmes, & Zohary,
2007), and research on stroke patients has demonstrated that
fronto-parietal lesions may result in specific deficits in multisen-
sory integration within peripersonal space (Làdavas & Farnè,
2004).
Furthermore,
studies
on
the
rubber
hand
illusion
(Botvinick & Cohen, 1998), in which a sense of ownership of an
artificial limb is elicited through synchronous touching of a partic-
ipant’s hidden hand and a rubber hand in view, have indicated that
the feeling of limb ownership is related to multisensory integration
in peripersonal space (Makin, Holmes, & Ehrsson, 2008). Three
main observations support this notion: (i) the rubber hand must
be placed within the theoretical limits of peripersonal space for
ownership sensations to be induced (Lloyd, 2007); (ii) the illusion
experience is associated with increased activity in a set of multi-
sensory areas similar to those in which peripersonal space neurons
have been identified in monkeys (Ehrsson, Spence, & Passingham,

 2004); and (iii) repeated presentation of an object close to an
owned rubber hand is coupled with increased fMRI-adaptation in
these cortical regions, suggesting that the object is encoded within
peripersonal space when the rubber hand is perceived as part of
the self (Brozzoli et al., 2012). However, a major challenge in the
study of peripersonal space in humans—particularly with respect
to its precise spatial extension and its involvement in the emer-
gence of body ownership—is the lack of an experimental paradigm
that allows individuals to directly ‘‘feel” multisensory integration
within peripersonal space.
In this study, we report a perceptual illusion in which healthy
participants perceive a ‘‘magnetic force” or ‘‘force field” between
a rubber hand and an object moving in mid-air close to the hand.
This ‘‘magnetic touch illusion” is elicited by synchronous brush-
strokes applied to a participant’s hidden real hand and brush-
strokes delivered at some distance above the rubber hand but
never actually touching it. In a series of eight experiments, we
show that the magnetic touch sensation correlates strongly with
the sense of rubber hand ownership and that it exhibits striking
similarities to the known neuronal properties of perihand neurons,
in terms of extension in space (Experiment 1a-1c and 4), indepen-
dence of gaze direction (Experiment 1c and 4), and hand-centered
spatial reference frames (Experiment 4). We also demonstrate that
‘‘tactile expectations” (Ferri, Chiarelli, Merla, Gallese, & Costantini,
2013) elicited by merely observing an object moving near the hand
do not contribute to the illusion experience (Experiment 2a and
2b) and that the magnetic force cannot penetrate physical barriers
(Experiment 3a and 3b), thus further linking this phenomenon to
the multisensory body representation and providing valuable pre-
dictions for future neurophysiological studies. In Experiment 4, we
combined motion tracking with a continuous real-time illusion
strength assessment to map out the extension of the magnetic
touch illusion in 3-D space and demonstrate that the illusion is
anchored to the position of the rubber hand. Together, these find-
ings led us to propose that the sense of magnetic touch constitutes
a perceptual correlate of visuo-tactile integration in peripersonal
space. Furthermore, the results provide strong support for the
notion that multisensory integration within peripersonal space is
key for the emergence of body ownership.
2. Methods
2.1. Participant information
We recruited a total of 101 healthy adult volunteers (60 female,
and 89 right-handed) for the eight experiments. All subjects gave
written informed consent prior to participation, and the Regional
Ethical Review Board of Stockholm approved all of the experimen-
tal procedures.
2.2. Overview of the experimental design
Experiments 1–3 followed the same general structure and con-
sisted of a 1-min period in which brushstrokes were delivered at
some distance above the rubber hand and to the unseen real right
hand. After each stimulation period, we quantified the illusion by
using questionnaire reports in the form of visual analog scale rat-
ings of different statements (Experiments 1a, 1b, 2a, and 3a; see
Table 1) or the degree of pointing error toward the rubber hand
(proprioceptive drift), using an intermanual pointing task in which
participants were asked to close their eyes and indicate the posi-
tion of their right index finger by using their left index finger
(Experiments 1c, 2b, and 3b; see Section 2.5 below). In Experiment
4, the participants continuously reported the subjective strength of
the illusion by using a sliding bar placed in their left hand. In the
questionnaire experiments (Experiments 1a, 1b, 2a, and 3a), each
condition was repeated once. In the proprioceptive drift experi-
ments (Experiments 1c, 2b, and 3b), each condition was repeated
three
times,
in
line
with
previously
published
protocols
(Guterstam, Gentile, & Ehrsson, 2013).
2.3. Experimental setup and illusion induction procedure
The experiments took place in a soundproof testing room (40-
decibel noise reduction). The participants sat on a comfortable
chair and rested their arms on a table in front of them. The partic-
ipants’ right arm was placed behind a screen (for all experiments
except Experiment 4, in which the arm was placed below a small
table) and was thus hidden from view in every experiment. A rub-
ber hand was placed on the table in full view of the participant. The
experimenter sat opposite the participant. The illusion was elicited
by applying brushstrokes to the participant’s hidden right hand
while simultaneously moving another brush at a predefined dis-
tance above rubber hand. A trained experimenter (AG or VM)
moved the brush in mid-air in a manner that reflected the curva-
ture of the rubber hand located below. A small sensor that contin-
uously
recorded
three-dimensional
spatial
coordinates
at
a
frequency of 60 Hz (see Section 2.6 below for details) was attached
to the tip of brush. The brushstrokes were applied to all five fingers
of the participant’s right hand and the corresponding locations
above the rubber hand, and they consisted of ‘long strokes’ (along
the entire length of the finger) and occasional short tapping move-
ments. In Experiments 2a-2b and 4, only tapping movements were
delivered. In the illusion condition, we used an irregular but syn-
chronous brushing rhythm. In the asynchronous condition, the pat-
tern of brushing was irregular and alternated between the real
hand and the empty space above the rubber hand. Approximately
30 strokes were applied per minute. The distance between the
index finger of the participant’s right hand and the index finger
of the rubber hand was 15 cm.
2.4. Questionnaires
In an open-ended pilot experiment, participants spontaneously
described the illusory sensation as a ‘‘repelling magnetic force”,
‘‘force field”, or ‘‘invisible rays of touch”, descriptions similar to
those reported in a previous relevant study (Hohwy & Paton,
2010). In the main experiments presented here, we used question-
naires (Botvinick & Cohen, 1998; Hohwy & Paton, 2010) that were
presented at the end of each condition to quantify the subjective
experiences associated with the illusion. The participants were
asked to confirm or deny different statements reflecting potential
perceptual effects by using a seven-point visual analog scale that
ranged from �3 to +3. The participants were informed that �3
indicated ‘‘I completely disagree”; +3 indicated ‘‘I agree com-
pletely”; and 0 indicated ‘‘I do not know, I can neither agree nor
disagree”. Statements 1 and 2 (S1-S2) were designed to examine
the sensation of magnetic touch, whereas statements 3 and 4
(S3-S4) served as controls for suggestibility and task compliance.
Statements 5 and 6 (S5-S6) were designed to examine the feeling
of rubber hand ownership; statements 7 and 8 (S7-S8) served as
controls.

2.5. Proprioceptive drift
The degree of pointing error toward an owned rubber hand—the
so called proprioceptive drift—is an indirect behavioral proxy of
the feeling of limb ownership (Botvinick & Cohen, 1998; Brozzoli
et al., 2012; Guterstam et al., 2013; Tsakiris & Haggard, 2005;
but see Rohde, Di Luca, & Ernst, 2011 for a critical view). To provide

45
 objective behavioral evidence for the illusion of magnetic touch,
we registered the proprioceptive drift in Experiments 1c, 2b, and
3b. Immediately before and after each period of brushing, the par-
ticipants were asked to close their eyes and indicate the position of
their right index finger by pointing with their left index finger.
Prior to obtaining this response, the experimenter placed the par-
ticipant’s left index finger at one of three fixed starting points (the
starting points were different for each repetition of a given condi-
tion, and the order was balanced across subjects) on a 1-m metal
ruler (the ruler’s markings were visible only to the experimenter)
positioned 1 cm above the rubber hand and the real hand. The ruler
penetrated the screen that separated the real hand and the rubber
hand (Fig. 2, left panel). While the participant’s eyes were closed,
the experimenter silently removed a large portion of the screen,
allowing the participant to slide freely with his or her left index
finger on the metal ruler, without colliding with the screen. Next,
the experimenter asked the participant to move his or her left
index finger briskly along the ruler (which contained a shallow
groove) and to stop when the finger was immediately above the
perceived location of the right index finger. We computed the dif-
ferences in the pointing error (toward the rubber hand) between
the measurements obtained before and after each stimulation per-
iod and averaged the responses from the three repetitions for each
experimental condition.
2.6. Motion tracking
A methodological challenge of the study was to objectively
quantify the accuracy of the experimenter in maintaining the
appropriate distance between the brush moving in mid-air and
the rubber hand. To this end, we used motion tracking based on
electromagnetic technology (Polhemus FASTRAK, Vermont, USA).
We attached a small motion sensor to the tip of the brush moving
in mid-air (Fig. 1A) and recorded its three-dimensional coordinates
at a rate of 60 Hz throughout Experiments 1a, 1b, 2a, and 4 (the
presence of large metal objects near the sensor prevented us from
using accurate motion tracking in Experiments 1c, 3a, and 3b). The
experimenter controlled the recording of motion tracking data by
pressing a foot pedal. A data file containing the X, Y, and Z coordi-
nates for the brush sensor was created for each repetition in every
condition and for all the participants. In the experiments that
featured mid-air brushstrokes (Experiments 1a and 1b) and for
purposes of visualization, we displayed only the data points in
mid-air that represented the actual touch (i.e., the data points that
correspond to the brush movements between the touches are not
shown) (Fig. 1B). In the experiments that featured continuous
‘tapping
movements’
rather
than
brushstrokes
(Experiments
2a and 4), the data points corresponding to the entire paintbrush
trajectory through 3-D space were included (Figs. 3B and 5).
2.7. Eye tracking
A CCTV camera (Protos IV, Vista, Wokingham, Berkshire, UK)
mounted on a small tripod placed on the table to the left of the par-
ticipant’s face was used to track the movements of the left eye. We
used the ViewPoint EyeTracker software (Arrington Research, Ari-
zona, USA) to record videos of eye movements throughout the
experimental sessions. The recordings were examined offline to
evaluate each participant’s fixation and overall alertness. No par-
ticipants had to be excluded because of an inability to fixate or
to keep their eyes open.
2.8. Experiments 1a, 1b, and 1c—The spatial extension of the magnetic
touch illusion
There were four main goals of Experiment 1a: (i) to examine
whether
the
previously
described
‘‘magnetic
touch
illusion”
(Hohwy & Paton, 2010) could be elicited without virtual reality
technology, i.e., using the ecological rubber hand illusion setup fea-
turing a visuo-proprioceptive conflict between the real and rubber
hand; (ii) to test whether rubber hand ownership could be elicited
using magnetic touch stimuli alone, i.e., without prior induction of
the normal rubber hand illusion (Hohwy & Paton, 2010); (iii) to
examine whether the magnetic touch illusion depends on syn-
chronous visual and tactile stimulation; and (iv) to investigate
whether increasing the distance between the rubber hand and
the brush in mid-air affects the strength of the illusion. To this
end, we included eight experimental conditions: synchronous
brushstrokes delivered to the real hand and in mid-air at the level
of 5 cm, 15 cm, 25 cm, 35 cm, 45 cm, or 55 cm above the rubber
hand and two conditions featuring asynchronous brushstrokes at
5 cm or 55 cm. A fixation point that consisted of a red LED was
located at the level of the rubber hand (‘‘0 cm”, see Fig. 1A). We
hypothesized that the magnetic touch illusion would be contingent
on synchronous visuo-tactile stimulation (Botvinick & Cohen,
1998) and that the illusion strength would have a non-linear rela-
tionship with increased distance, with a significant decay between
35 and 45 cm, reflecting the typical extension of the visual RF for
peripersonal space neurons in primates (640 cm) (Fogassi et al.,
1996) and the spatial limits of the rubber hand illusion (Kalckert
& Ehrsson, 2014; Lloyd, 2007). We analyzed the average ratings
of the statements reflecting the magnetic touch sensation (S1-S2)
and rubber hand ownership (S5-S6) separately. To examine the
basic illusion experience, we computed the three-way interaction
for
visuo-tactile
temporal
congruence
(synchronous,
asyn-
chronous) � distance (5 cm, 55 cm) � statement type (illusion,
control) in a 2 � 2 � 2 ANOVA. We tested for non-linearity in the
illusion strength decline with distance by fitting three different
curves to the data—one linear, f(x) = a ⁄ x + b, one logarithmic, f
(x) = a ⁄ log(x) + b, and one sigmoid, f(x) = a/(1 + e(�(x�b)/c))—under

Fig. 1. The spatial extension of the magnetic touch illusion (Experiment 1a and 1b). (A) Experimental setup. The experimenter applied synchronous brushstrokes to the
participant’s right hand (hidden behind the screen) and in mid-air at six different distances above the rubber hand. Asynchronous brushstrokes were applied only at the
lowest (5 cm) and highest (55 cm) levels. Experiment 1a featured a lower fixation point (0 cm) and Experiment 1b a higher fixation point (10 cm). (B) The motion tracking
results of the brush moving in mid-air. The data points represent the 3-D spatial coordinates (at 60 Hz) of each brushstroke applied throughout Experiment 1a and 1b and
demonstrate a high degree of experimenter precision and consistency. (C–F) Results. The average rating of the magnetic touch and the rubber hand ownership statements are
displayed as a function of the distance between the brush in mid-air and the rubber hand for the lower (C, D) and higher fixation point (E, F), respectively. In all four cases (C–
F), the decline in illusion strength was non-linear, and a sigmoid function was always a better curve fit than a linear or a logarithmic fit (see Table 2). Pairwise t-tests between
neighboring levels in the synchronous condition showed a significant and consistent drop in the illusion strength between the distances of 35 cm and 45 cm, which was
independent of fixation. The P-values for the pairwise contrasts are shown in the graphs between the corresponding data points. The error bars represent SEM. (G, H) In both
Experiment 1a (G) and 1b (H), we observed a significant correlation between the ratings of magnetic touch and rubber hand ownership, suggesting that these two perceptual
phenomena are closely related. D = Synchronous versus asynchronous difference.

 the hypothesis that the sigmoid function would be the best fit. For
this analysis, the input consisted of the average rating of the
illusion statements for each of the six levels in the synchronous
condition. We applied a winner-take-all approach based on the
R-squared curve fit in accordance with a previous relevant study
(Lloyd, 2007). We also performed pairwise t-tests between each
succeeding level and predicted a significant drop in illusion
strength between 35 and 45 cm. Twenty-one participants (age
27 ± 5.1 years, 12 females) took part in Experiment 1a.
Conceivably, the non-linear illusion decline between 35 and
45 cm observed in Experiment 1a might be explained by the brush
entering the far peripheral visual field rather than reflecting the
spatial boundaries of the visual RF for perihand neurons. To
exclude this possibility, we conducted Experiment 1b, which was
identical to Experiment 1a, except that the fixation point was
located 10 cm higher, i.e., 10 cm above the level of the rubber hand
(see Fig. 1A). If the retinal distance between the fovea and the
brush moving in mid-air fully explains the non-linear illusion
decline at approximately 40 cm, elevating the fixation point by
10 cm should be accompanied by a 10 cm elevation of the upper
limit of the magnetic touch illusion. However, if the spatial limits
of the magnetic touch illusion are contingent on the distance
between the (rubber) hand and the paintbrush in a hand-
centered spatial reference frame that is akin to the RF properties
of visuo-tactile neurons coding for perihand space (Fogassi et al.,
1996; Graziano et al., 1997), then the level at which the illusion
abruptly declines should be independent of fixation. Consistently
with the latter notion and the observation of a sharp decline in
the illusion between 35 and 45 cm in Experiment 1a (see Fig. 1C,
upper two plots), we predicted that there would be no significant
interaction between fixation (0 cm, 10 cm) and distance (35 cm,
45 cm) in a mixed 2 � 2 ANOVA for both the magnetic touch sen-
sation and rubber hand ownership ratings. Twenty participants
(age 27 ± 6.7 years, 15 females) took part in Experiment 1b.
To further investigate the relationship between the senses mag-
netic touch and rubber hand ownership, we examined the correla-
tion between the subjective magnitudes of the two perceptual
effects. To control for factors unrelated to the illusion, we
compared the synchronous versus asynchronous difference in the
average
ratings
(at
the
five
cm
level,
because
the
other
illusion-associated levels, 15–35 cm, did not feature an asyn-
chronous control condition) of the magnetic touch statements
(S1-S2) and the rubber hand ownership statements (S5-S6). The
degree of linear dependence between the two resulting variables
was estimated using the Pearson product-moment correlation
coefficient.
To corroborate the questionnaire results from Experiments 1a
and 1b with an objective behavioral proxy of limb ownership, we
quantified the proprioceptive drift associated with the illusion
(for details, see Section 2.5 above). On the basis of our own empir-
ical questionnaire data (Experiments 1a and 1b) and the theoreti-
cal arguments outlined above (Fogassi et al., 1996; Kalckert &
Ehrsson, 2014; Lloyd, 2007), we expected the distance of 45 cm
to fall just outside perihand space and thus to constitute the spatial
constraint of the illusion. We therefore used a full factorial design
with the factors visuo-tactile temporal congruence (synchronous,
asynchronous) and distance (5 cm, 45 cm). In line with this
hypothesis, we predicted a significant interaction between visuo-
tactile temporal congruence and distance in a 2 � 2 ANOVA that
was driven mainly by an increased proprioceptive drift in the illu-
sion condition (synchronous 5 cm). Twenty participants (age
30 ± 8.5 years, 12 females) were included in Experiment 1c.
2.9. Experiments 2a and 2b—Excluding a contribution of tactile
expectation
A previous study has claimed that the rubber hand illusion can
be elicited through the mere expectation of a tactile event on the
rubber hand (Ferri et al., 2013). In that study, the participants
observed an object slowly approaching (2 cm/s)—without touch-
ing—a rubber hand, while no touches were delivered to the hidden
real hand. If this claim that the mere expectation of tactile stimu-
lation is sufficient to induce a sense of limb ownership were true,
then the illusion under investigation should be independent of tac-
tile stimulation of the real hand and the observed reduction in illu-
sion strength associated with the asynchronous visuo-tactile
stimulation would be caused by violations of such tactile expecta-
tions. To address this issue and to examine the reproducibility of
the previous study (Ferri et al., 2013), we included three conditions
in Experiments 2a and 2b: (i) visual stimulation in the form of a

Fig. 2. Proprioceptive drift (Experiment 1c). (A) Experimental setup. Immediately before and after each trial, the participants were asked to close their eyes while their left
index finger were placed in a shallow groove on a metal ruler that penetrated the screen. The experimenter then opened a large hatch in the screen and asked the participants
to point to the perceived location of their right index finger. The relative difference between the ‘before’ and ‘after’ measurement constituted the proprioceptive drift of a
given trial. (B) Consistently with the questionnaire results (Fig. 1), the proprioceptive drift toward the rubber hand was significantly greater in the synchronous condition
when the brushstrokes were applied in mid-air 5 cm above the hand compared with 45 cm, and when asynchronous visuo-tactile stimulation was applied at either distance.

 brush slowly approaching (2 cm/s) the rubber hand in a continu-
ous, ‘tapping’ motion in combination with synchronous tapping
on the real hand (synchronous visuo-tactile); (ii) only visual stimu-
lation featuring the same approaching ‘tapping’ motion toward the
rubber hand, presumably eliciting ‘‘tactile expectations” (Ferri
et al., 2013) (visual only, approaching brush); and (iii) only visual
stimulation featuring a brush held at a fixed position approxi-
mately 35 cm above the rubber hand, which should not induce tac-
tile expectations (Ferri et al., 2013) (visual only, static brush)
(Fig. 3A and B). The participants had no fixation point but were
instructed to attentively look at the brush moving toward the rub-
ber hand. We hypothesized that synchronous visual and tactile
stimulation is critical to eliciting the illusion and that the mere
sight of an object moving toward the rubber hand within its
peripersonal space would not be sufficient to elicit the perceptual
effects under investigation. Thus, we expected to find a significant
difference between synchronous visuo-tactile versus the visual only,
approaching brush condition with respect to the magnetic touch
sensation, as well as rubber hand ownership (two planned paired
t-tests). Furthermore, to investigate the reproducibility of the pre-
viously observed ‘tactile expectation effect’ (Ferri et al., 2013), we
contrasted visual only, approaching brush versus visual only, static
brush conditions (paired t-test) and examined the hypothesis of
significantly stronger rubber hand ownership ratings in the visual
only, approaching brush condition. Twenty-one participants (age
27 ± 5.1 years, 12 females) were included in Experiment 2a. The
same set of participants had previously taken part in Experiment
1a.
To corroborate the questionnaire results, we recruited a sepa-
rate group of participants (n = 20, age 24 ± 4.0 years, 12 females)
and measured the proprioceptive drift. The experimental proce-
dures were identical to those in Experiment 2a. In line with the
rationale described above, we expected to find a significantly
greater drift in the synchronous visuo-tactile compared with the
visual only, approaching brush condition. We also examined the
hypothesis of Ferri et al. (2013) for a significant difference
between the visual only, approaching brush versus visual only,
static brush.

magnetic touch illusion, the participant observed the brush slowly approaching the rubber hand in a continuous, ‘tapping’ motion while synchronous tapping occurred on the
real hand (synchronous visuo-tactile). In the control conditions, no tactile stimulation was delivered to the real hand, but the participants viewed either the same approaching
‘tapping’ motion (visual only, approaching brush) or a brush held at a fixed position above the rubber hand (visual only, static brush). (B) The motion tracking results of the three
experimental conditions. (C–E) Results. The reported strength of the sensations of magnetic touch and rubber hand ownership, as well as the proprioceptive drift magnitude,
was significantly higher in the synchronous visuo-tactile condition than in the visual only, approaching brush condition, suggesting that concurrent tactile stimulation is
essential to the illusion. Furthermore, there were no significant differences between the visual only, approaching brush versus the visual only, static brush conditions for
magnetic touch, rubber hand ownership ratings, or proprioceptive drift. These results show that tactile expectations putatively elicited by merely viewing an object
approaching in the perihand space did not contribute to the emergence of limb ownership or magnetic touch sensations in the present paradigm (see Section 4).

 2.10. Experiments 3a and 3b—The effect of a physical barrier on
magnetic touch
The aim of Experiment 3a was to investigate whether the mag-
netic touch illusion could penetrate a physical barrier. Consistently
with the notions that the representation of peripersonal is influ-
enced by an individual’s ability to directly act upon or reach to a
given portion of space (Maravita, Spence, & Driver, 2003) and that
solid non-corporal objects disrupt the visuo-tactile integration pro-
cesses associated with the rubber hand illusion (Guterstam et al.,
2013; Tsakiris, Carpenter, James, & Fotopoulou, 2010), we hypoth-
esized that a physical barrier would impose a spatial restriction on
the perihand space. Under the assumption that the magnetic touch
illusion is a perceptual correlate of visuo-tactile integration in per-
ihand space, we predicted that the illusion strength would be sig-
nificantly reduced by a physical barrier obstructing the illusory
rays of magnetic force between the brush and the rubber hand.
We tested this hypothesis by introducing a 3-cm-thick metal table
between the brush moving in mid-air and the rubber hand
(Fig. 4A). We included four conditions in a 2 � 2 factorial design:
synchronous or asynchronous visuo-tactile stimulation with or
without a ‘barrier’ between the rubber hand and the brush in
mid-air. Notably, the participant’s viewing angle ensured that the
rubber hand and the fixation point were in full view in the two bar-
rier conditions. The general experimental procedures were identi-
cal to those in Experiment 1a, and the brushstrokes were always
delivered 15 cm above the rubber hand. We predicted a significant
interaction between the factors visuo-tactile temporal congruence
(synchronous, asynchronous) and barrier (free empty space, bar-
rier) in a 2 � 2 ANOVA. However, because the data were not nor-
mally distributed, we performed the non-parametric Friedman
test in combination with Wilcoxon signed-rank tests between the
conditions of interest. Twenty participants (age 24 ± 4.0 years, 12
females) were included in Experiment 3a. The same set of partici-
pants had previously taken part in Experiment 2b.
To complement the questionnaire results of Experiment 3a with
an objective behavioral proxy of the illusion, we measured the pro-
prioceptive drift according to the procedures described above for
Experiments 1c and 2b in a separate group of twenty participants
(age 27 ± 6.9 years, nine females). The experimental design and
planned
statistical
comparisons
were
identical
to
those
in
Experiment 3a.
2.11. Experiment 4—The three-dimensional extension of the illusion
The aim of Experiment 4 was to map out the spatial extension of
the magnetic touch illusion in three dimensions. The results of
Experiments 1–3 support the notion that the illusory sensation
of a magnetic force or force field between the brush moving in
mid-air and the rubber hand reflects a perceptual correlate of
visuo-tactile integration in peripersonal space. On the basis of
neurophysiological evidence showing that the visual RF of periper-
sonal space neurons typically extends 640 cm from the tactile RF
(Fogassi et al., 1996) and follows changes in hand position
(Graziano et al., 1997; Obayashi, Tanaka, & Iriki, 2000), we hypoth-
esized the magnetic touch illusion would display similar spatial
characteristics. To map out the 3-D extension of the illusion, we
constructed a setup in which the participant’s right hand was hid-
den in a fixed position below a small 15-cm-high table. The rubber
hand was placed directly on top of the small table in one of two dif-
ferent positions, which were displaced by eight cm laterally or
medially with respect to the real hand below (Fig. 5A). A fixation

Fig. 4. The effect of a physical barrier on magnetic touch (Experiment 3a and 3b). (A) Experimental setup. Synchronous or asynchronous brushstrokes were delivered to the
participant’s hidden right hand and in mid-air 15 cm above the rubber hand in either the absence (‘‘free empty space”) or presence (‘‘barrier” as shown in the figure) of a 3-
cm-thick metal barrier between the rubber hand and the brush. Crucially, the fixation point, rubber hand, and brush were in the participant’s line of sight in all conditions. (B–
D) Results. In the absence of a barrier, the synchronous condition was associated with significantly stronger magnetic touch and rubber hand ownership ratings and a greater
proprioceptive drift toward the rubber hand than was the asynchronous condition. No such significant differences were observed in the barrier conditions, suggesting that the
introduction of a physical barrier between the rubber hand and the brush disrupts the magnetic touch illusion.

 point was placed between the positions of the rubber hand. The
experimenter induced the illusion by applying synchronous tap-
ping movements to the hidden real hand and in mid-air five cm
above the rubber hand. Once the participant reported the onset
of the illusion, the experimenter began to slowly increase the
distance (approximately 2 cm/s) between the brush tapping in
mid-air and the rubber hand. To systematically map out the 3-D
extension of the illusion, the tapping brush moved away from the
rubber hand in one out of 17 predefined directions: eight direc-
tions in 45� steps in-plane with the rubber hand, eight directions
in 45� steps projected at an angle of 45� vertical to the plane of the
rubber hand, and one direction straight upward from the rubber
hand (Fig. 5B). The participants were instructed to continuously
rate the subjective strength of the magnetic touch sensation
(statement S2 in Table 1) by using a sliding bar (TSD115 Variable
assessment transducer, BIOPAC, Goleta, California, USA) placed in
their left hand. We used in-house software (developed by author
HZ) to synchronize the motion tracking data from the sensor
attached to the brush moving in mid-air with the input from the
sliding
bar
representing
the
participant’s
experience
of
the
illusion’s vividness in real time. As such, a given data point in
3-D space was assigned an illusion vividness value between �3
and +3, which is denoted by the color code in Fig. 5B. Finally, the
location of the rubber hand within the coordinate system was
determined by systematically moving the motion sensor across
the entire rubbery skin surface.
We mapped the spatial extension of the illusion for the two rub-
ber hand positions in four participants (age 30 ± 2.9 years, 1
female), all of whom had displayed a robust illusion experience
(at least +2 rating of statement S2) in one of the previous experi-
ments. For each participant, the data were extrapolated to a dis-
crete 3-D volume through the following method. We first defined
a
180 � 180 � 180 cm3
cube
with
the
spatial
resolution
of
1 � 1 � 1 cm3. The fixed location of the motion tracking base sta-
tion represented the origin coordinate [X = 1, Y = 1, Z = 1]. To each
voxel, we assigned an illusion vividness value to the nearest (in
terms of Euclidean distance) experimentally tested data point.

Fig. 5. The three-dimensional spatial extension of the illusion. (A) Setup. The experimenter used two small brushes to elicit the magnetic touch illusion by synchronously
tapping the participant’s hidden real hand and in mid-air above the rubber hand placed in full view in one of two positions (here, the medial position is shown). Once the
illusion had been established, the experimenter slowly increased the distance between the brush in mid-air and the rubber hand in one out of 17 predefined directions (panel
B). The participants were instructed to maintain their gaze at a fixation point (indicated by the red star) placed between the two rubber hand positions and to continuously
rate the strength of the illusion by using a sliding bar. By synchronizing the real-time illusion vividness rating with the motion tracking data from the brush moving in mid-
air, we mapped out the 3-D spatial extension of the illusion in four individuals. (B) The raw data for the two rubber hand positions, consisting of the spatial coordinates for the
17 ‘tapping trajectories’, color-coded according to the illusion vividness rating, are shown for one representative participant (P1). (C) The rated illusion strength is plotted as a
function of the Euclidean distance from the rubber hand (positioned medially) for each participant. Each line represents one of the 17 directions, and the red vertical line
shows the median illusion break point. The illusion showed a non-linear sharp decline at approximately 20–80 cm (depending on the direction) that was consistent across
participants (mean illusion break point ± SD: 37.6 ± 6.5 cm), which is in line with the results of Experiment 1. (D) To investigate whether the illusion followed changes in the
rubber hand position, we examined the difference in spatial coordinates of the geometric center for the lateral versus medial positions along the X-axis (the Y- and Z-axes
served as controls). All the participants showed a large and consistent shift in the estimated geometric center along the X-axis (mean shift: 17.5 ± 4.8 cm; P = 0.0054) that
reflected the change in rubber hand position (16 cm). The shifts along the Y- and Z-axes were non-significant (both P > 0.05). These results suggest that the multisensory
integrative processes underlying the magnetic touch illusion operate in hand-centered spatial reference frames. (E and F) The 3-D extension of the illusion, extrapolated from
the raw data displayed in panel B (see Section 2.11 for details), is shown here in 2D at a slice along the X-Y-plane at the height of the rubber hand knuckles (panel E) and in 3-D
(panel F). The solid circles represent the actual rubber hand positions, and the open circles represent the estimated geometric center (blue = medial position; red = lateral
position). (A–F) P1-P4 = Participant 1–4. RH = rubber hand. ⁄⁄P < 0.01. n.s.=non-significant (P > 0.05).

 the rubber hand (approximately 30 cm at the illusion ‘break point’;
see Fig. 5B), the data were then smoothed with a moving average
technique in which the value of each voxel was replaced with
the mean value of a 30 � 30 � 30 cm3 cube centered on that voxel.
The smoothing procedure ensured a relatively homogenous surface
among the experimentally tested directions. In accordance with
the results of Experiment 1, we defined the illusion break point
as the spatial coordinates where the rated illusion strength
dropped below zero, i.e., when the participants began to deny
experiencing the illusion. The 3-D surface of the illusion extension
was drawn using linear interpolation (Fig. 5E and F). For display
purposes, Fig. 5E shows the illusion extension for each rubber hand
position in the X-Y plane at the height of the knuckles of the rubber
hand, whereas Fig. 5F shows their entire 3-D surface.
To assess whether the illusion was anchored to the rubber hand,
we calculated the geometric center of the illusion volume for each
rubber hand position. We then tested for significant shifts along
the X, Y and Z directions by using paired t-tests. Because the rubber
hand position was changed only in the horizontal plane, we pre-
dicted that the geometric center would significantly shift only
along the X-axis. We would like to emphasize that even though
our sample size is ‘‘extremely low” (n = 4), it is possible to make
group-level statistical inferences using the t-test, given that the
effect size is large and that the shift direction is consistent across
all participants (de Winter, 2013).
2.12. Statistical approach
The Kolmogorov-Smirnov test was used to assess the normality
of the data. For normally distributed data sets, we used t-tests to
analyze differences between two conditions and repeated mea-
sures ANOVAs to analyze the differences among more than two
conditions. For data sets that were not normally distributed, we
used the non-parametric Wilcoxon signed-rank test to analyze dif-
ferences between two conditions and the Friedman test to analyze
differences among more than two conditions. For simplicity, two-
tailed tests were used for all analyses, and the alpha was set at
5%. The goodness of fit analyses in Experiments 1a and 1b were
carried out using the Curve Fitting Toolbox for MatLab version
R2015a (MathWorks, Massachusetts, USA). The other statistical
analyses were carried out in SPSS version 21 (IBM, New York,
USA). The 3-D extension of the illusion was estimated using Math-
ematica version 10 (Wolfram, Illinois, USA), and the statistical pro-
cedures are described above (see Section 2.11).
3. Results
3.1. Experiments 1a, 1b, and 1c—The spatial extension of the magnetic
touch illusion
The first aim was to test the prediction that the magnetic touch
illusion is dependent on synchronous visuo-tactile stimulation
within the space close to the body. To this end, we first compared
synchronous and asynchronous brushstrokes delivered to the real
hand and in mid-air near (5 cm) or far (55 cm) above the rubber
hand. In support of our hypothesis, the results showed that the
synchronous 5 cm condition was associated with significantly
higher ratings in the questionnaire statements that reflected the
illusory experiences of magnetic touch and rubber hand ownership
(three-way interaction visuo-tactile temporal congruence � dis-
tance � statement type, for both gaze positions, all P < 0.001;
Fig. 1C–F), as well as a significantly greater proprioceptive drift
toward the rubber hand (interaction visuo-tactile temporal con-
gruence � distance, P < 0.001; Fig. 2). In a post hoc control analysis,
we found that the differences in mean coordinates and standard
deviations of the brushstroke trajectories in the synchronous and
asynchronous conditions (Fig. 1B) were negligible—on the order
of 1 cm—in all spatial dimensions and thus could not explain the
observed differences in the strength of the illusion. The question-
naire ratings of magnetic touch sensation and rubber hand owner-
ship were strongly correlated in both Experiment 1a (r = 0.78,
P < 0.001;
Fig.
1G)
and
Experiment
1b
(r = 0.45,
P = 0.045;
Fig. 1H), suggesting an intimate relationship between tactile refer-
ral in peripersonal space and the feeling of limb ownership.
Second, we examined the prediction that the illusion strength
would display a non-linear decay featuring a significant drop at
an approximate distance of 40 cm between the rubber hand and
the brush in mid-air, reflecting the visual RF properties of periper-
sonal space neurons (Fogassi et al., 1996; Kalckert & Ehrsson, 2014;
Lloyd, 2007). The results showed that a sigmoid function—in com-
parison with a linear and a logarithmic function—was the best R-
squared curve fit for the questionnaire data regardless of statement
category (magnetic touch sensation or rubber hand ownership)
and gaze (0 cm or 10 cm), as shown in Fig. 1C–F and Table 2. For
the lower fixation point (0 cm; Experiment 1a), the only significant
reduction in the illusion strength between neighboring levels of
mid-air brushing occurred between 35 and 45 cm (Fig. 1C and D),
which is compatible with our a priori hypothesis. The higher fixa-
tion point (10 cm; Experiment 1b) was also associated with a
reduction (albeit less significant), in illusion strength between 5
and 15 cm (Figure E and F), which supposedly reflected that the
5-cm level in that experiment was the only level at which the
brush in mid-air and the rubber hand were on the same side of
the fixation point.
Finally, we sought to exclude the possibility that the non-linear
illusion decline between 35 and 45 cm might merely be due to the
visual impression of the brush falling in the far peripheral field of
vision and that the spatial constraints of the illusion might conse-
quently be defined in a purely retinotopic spatial reference frame.
To this end, we tested whether elevating the level of the gaze by
ten cm would be accompanied by a similar upward shift in the
spatial extension of the illusion, by using a mixed 2 � 2 ANOVA
featuring the between-subject factor gaze (0 cm, 10 cm) and the
within-subject factor distance (35 cm, 45 cm). The interaction
gaze � distance was non-significant in terms of both magnetic
touch (F = 0.01, P = 0.92) and rubber hand ownership (F = 0.71;
P = 0.40). Importantly, the magnetic touch sensation was not
significantly affected by gaze (main effect: F = 0.07; P = 0.80),
although the participants rated rubber hand ownership lower
when the fixation point was placed farther from the rubber hand
(main effect of gaze: F = 5.09, P = 0.03). In conjunction with the
observed similarities in the curve shape and a significant reduction
in the illusion strength between 35 and 45 cm (Fig. 1C and D versus
1E and F), these results suggest that the spatial extension of the
illusion could not be explained by mechanisms operating in
retinocentric coordinates but that such a mechanism must involve
Table 2
Non-linear decay in illusion strength. A sigmoid curve best described the decline in
illusion strength as a function of the distance between the rubber hand and the brush
moving in mid-air. The results are displayed separately for the two gaze positions and

3.2. Experiments 2a and 2b—Visuo-tactile integration versus visually
induced tactile expectation
The aim of Experiments 2a and 2b was to disambiguate the
hypothesized contribution of visuo-tactile integration in the mag-
netic touch illusion from the possible effect of tactile expectations
automatically triggered by viewing an object moving toward the
hand in peripersonal space. This investigation was motivated by
a previous study claiming that the expectation of tactile stimula-
tion alone—in the form of an object slowly approaching the rubber
hand without touching it—is sufficient to induce a vivid illusion of
rubber hand ownership (Ferri et al., 2013). To address this issue,
we adapted our illusion setup to mimic the setup developed by
Ferri and colleagues as closely as possible (see Section 2). Here,
the brush moving in mid-air approached the rubber hand in a slow,
continuous, tapping motion that occurred in combination with
synchronous tapping on the real hand (synchronous visuo-tactile),
without tapping on the real hand (visual only, approaching brush),
or with just the vision of the rubber hand with the brush in mid-
air held in a static position (visual only, static brush). Consistently
with our hypothesis, the results showed that the synchronous
visuo-tactile condition compared to the visual only, approaching
brush condition was associated with significantly higher question-
naire ratings of magnetic touch (t = 6.79, P < 0.001; Fig. 3C) and
rubber hand ownership (t = 5.67, P < 0.001; Fig. 3D), as well as
greater proprioceptive drift toward the rubber hand (t = 3.09,
P = 0.006; Fig. 3E). These results show that the magnetic touch illu-
sion is dependent on congruent tactile and visual stimulation in
peripersonal space, in addition to any expectation effect resulting
from merely viewing a moving object near the hand. Moreover,
the visual only, approaching brush condition was associated with
negative questionnaire ratings (i.e., on average, the participants
denied the illusory experiences) and did not significantly differ
from the visual only, static brush control condition for the magnetic
touch sensation (t = 1.98, P = 0.062; Fig. 3C) or rubber hand owner-
ship (t = 0.98, P = 0.339; Fig. 3D). In line with these negative ques-
tionnaire
results,
we
observed
no
significant
differences
in
proprioceptive drift between the visual only, approaching brush
and the visual only, static brush conditions (t = 1.76, P = 0.095;
Fig. 3E). Thus, the visually induced tactile expectation effect
reported by Ferri and colleagues was not replicated in the present
study.
3.3. Experiments 3a and 3b—The effect of a physical barrier on
magnetic touch
The goal of Experiments 3a and 3b was to examine whether the
illusory sensation of magnetic touch would be maintained even
when a solid barrier was introduced between the rubber hand
and the brush moving in mid-air. To address this question, we
compared synchronous and asynchronous brushstrokes on the real
hand and in mid-air 15 cm above the rubber hand, with (barrier)
or without (free) a 3-cm-thick metal plate positioned between
the rubber hand and the brush (Fig. 4A). Compared with the syn-
chronous barrier condition and the two asynchronous conditions,
the participants in the synchronous free condition reported signifi-
cantly
stronger
sensations
of
magnetic

(v2 = 26.15,

(v2 = 32.59,

was

suggest that solid barriers in the space close to the body restrict
the spatial extension of the magnetic touch illusion, which we
hypothesize is reflected in the restriction of the visual RFs of
perihand neurons.
3.4. Experiment 4—The three-dimensional extension of the illusion
The aim of Experiment 4 was to map out the spatial limits of the
magnetic touch illusion in 3-D. To this end, we synchronized 3-D
motion tracking of the brush in mid-air with real-time illusion
vividness ratings and used this setup to systematically map out
the illusion decline with distance in 17 directions for two different
rubber hand positions with four participants (Fig. 4A and B). The
results showed that the magnetic touch illusion extended fairly
homogeneously around the rubber hand (Fig. 4E and F) and dis-
played a non-linear abrupt decline (a sigmoid function was a better
fit than a linear function for all four participants; Fig. 5C) at the
mean
distance
of
38.7 ± 5.7 cm
(±SD)
(39.8 ± 5.5 cm
and
37.6 ± 6.5 cm for the lateral and medial rubber hand position,
respectively; Fig. 5C), results consistent with those from Experi-
ment 1. Crucially, the geometric center of the ‘‘illusion volume” fol-
lowed changes in the rubber hand position for all four participants
(Fig.
5D
and
E).
The
estimated
geometric
center
shifted
17.5 ± 4.8 cm along the X-axis, on average, which mirrored the
16-cm difference between the rubber hand positions in the hori-
zontal plane. Because the shift was large and consistent across all
four participants, it was statistically significant at the group-level
(t = 7.27, P = 0.0054, paired t-test) despite our small sample size
(de Winter, 2013). In two control analyses, we estimated the shifts
along the Y- and Z-axes, which were both non-significant (P > 0.05;
Fig. 5D). In addition to providing a qualitative validation of the
results of Experiment 1, these results suggest that the illusion is
anchored to the rubber hand and that the processes underpinning
the magnetic touch illusion thus operates in hand-centered spatial
reference frames. Finally, visual inspection of the ‘‘illusion vol-
umes” seemed to suggest that the spatial extension of the illusion
might change with the rubber hand position (see P1, P2, and P4 in
Fig. 5E and F). However, the results across participants and medial-
lateral rubber hand positions were inconsistent and should be sys-
tematically investigated in future studies with larger sample sizes
and multiple rubber hand positions.
4. Discussion
In summary, we used motion tracking and multiple behavioral
measurements to characterize a perceptual illusion that allows
healthy participants to experience a ‘‘magnetic force” radiating
from a brush moving in mid-air to the surface of a rubber hand.
This magnetic touch illusion is induced by applying synchronous
brushstrokes on the participant’s hidden hand and in mid-air at
some distance above a fully visible rubber hand. Three main con-
clusions can be drawn from the data. First, the magnetic touch illu-
sion exhibited a non-linear decay at a distance of approximately
40 cm from the rubber hand that was independent of gaze direc-
tion. In addition, the illusion was spatially anchored to the rubber
hand, i.e., the portion of space in which the illusion could be eli-
cited followed changes in rubber hand position, an observation
bearing close similarities to the neurophysiological properties of
peripersonal space neurons. Second, the integration of visual and
tactile stimuli was crucial, and the mere expectation of touch—
which is likely to be triggered when seeing a brush moving toward
the hand in peripersonal space—contributed neither to the mag-
netic touch sensation nor to the feeling of rubber hand ownership,

 which challenges the findings of a previous study (Ferri et al.,
2013). Finally, the illusory magnetic force field could not be
induced when a physical barrier was introduced between the rub-
ber hand and the brush in mid-air, suggesting that the underlying
visuo-tactile integrative mechanisms are restricted by solid barri-
ers within the visual perihand space. Together, our findings pro-
vide converging evidence for the notion that the magnetic touch
illusion reflects the visuo-tactile RF properties of hand-centered
perihand neurons, potentially constituting a perceptual correlate
of visuo-tactile integration in peripersonal space.
The present illusion setup was inspired by a previous study
using a virtual reality (VR) version of the rubber hand illusion
(Hohwy & Paton, 2010). In that study, the experimenter first
induced a sense of ownership of a virtual hand that was spatially
co-aligned with the real hand and then elevated the brush and con-
tinued applying brushstrokes five cm above the hand, resulting in
the experience of magnetic touch. In the present study, we show
that the magnetic touch illusion can be elicited outside of VR, with
no prior induction of ownership of the artificial limb and despite a
visuo-proprioceptive conflict between the seen and felt hands.
These results suggest that visual stimulation within an artificial
hand’s perihand space in conjunction with spatio-temporally con-
gruent tactile stimulation can drive the remapping of the position
sense and the emergence of ownership sensations. Furthermore,
our findings suggest that the magnetic touch phenomenon and
rubber hand ownership are correlated and concurrent, which
argues against the interpretation that the brain integrates the
visual signals from the brush moving in mid-air with tactile input
(resulting in the perception of magnetic touch) only if ownership of
the rubber hand has previously been established by inducing the
normal rubber hand illusion (Hohwy & Paton, 2010). Instead, our
results suggest that the magnetic touch illusion is a perceptual cor-
relate of the integration of spatio-temporally congruent visual
stimuli in perihand space and tactile signals—a mechanism consid-
ered to be key to the emergence of body ownership (Ehrsson, 2012;
Guterstam et al., 2013; Makin et al., 2008; Moseley, Gallace, &
Spence, 2012; Samad, Chung, & Shams, 2015). Although there is a
visible gap, the brain interprets the visual information from the
brush in mid-air and the rubber hand below as causing the tactile
and proprioceptive sensations from the real hidden hand, resulting
in the coherent multisensory perception of a single hand (the rub-
ber hand) being touched by an invisible magnetic force ‘‘radiating”
from the tip of the brush onto the portion of the rubber hand skin
surface corresponding to the location where the real hand is
touched. Why is this ‘‘physically impossible” visuo-tactile integra-
tion permitted? We speculate that the answer lies in the fact that
we are used to objects close to our bodies causing sensations on
the skin surface without direct physical contact (e.g., air flow or
radiating heat) and that unlike objects far from our bodies, an
object moving within peripersonal space represents a potential
impending tactile sensation (Graziano & Cooke, 2006), which
thereby facilitates the integration of vision and touch. Thus, our
findings suggest that the multisensory integrative processes
involved in the magnetic touch illusion are similar to those under-
pinning the classical rubber hand illusion (Botvinick & Cohen,
1998; Ehrsson et al., 2004; Samad et al., 2015; Tsakiris &
Haggard, 2005) and that these processes are capable of ‘‘filling
the gap” between the brush in mid-air and the rubber hand, as long
as the brush remains within the rubber hand’s peripersonal space.
The phenomenology of the magnetic touch illusion bears a close
resemblance to the RF properties of peripersonal space neurons,
which have been identified in the putamen (Graziano & Gross,
1993) and the premotor (Graziano et al., 1997; Rizzolatti et al.,
1981) and posterior parietal cortices (Avillac, Hamed, & Duhamel,
2007; Graziano, 2000). This set of anatomically interconnected
regions receives convergent visual, tactile, and proprioceptive
inputs and contains neuronal populations that build representa-
tions
of
the
body
and
its
surrounding
peripersonal
space
(Graziano & Botvinick, 2002). Single-unit recordings in macaques
have identified trimodal neurons featuring visual RFs that (i)
extend up to 40 cm from a tactile RF (Fogassi et al., 1996), (ii) fol-
low changes in limb position (Graziano, 1999), and (iii) are inde-
pendent of gaze direction (Graziano & Gross, 1998). In line with
our a priori hypothesis, the results from Experiments 1a-1c and 4
show that the magnetic touch illusion is dependent on temporally
congruent visuo-tactile stimulation and that its spatial boundaries
mimic RF properties (i)–(iii), suggesting that the magnetic touch
illusion is closely related to visuo-tactile integration within peri-
hand space. Furthermore, the vividness of the magnetic touch illu-
sion
was
strongly
correlated
with
perceived
rubber
hand
ownership, suggesting that these two perceptual effects depend
on similar underlying processes. These results not only extend
beyond previous studies (Brozzoli et al., 2011; Guterstam et al.,
2013; Lloyd, 2007; Pavani, Spence, & Driver, 2000; Preston, 2013)
in showing an intimate relationship between multisensory integra-
tion in peripersonal space and limb ownership, but also reveal a
perceptual correlate of the visuo-tactile integration in peripersonal
space in the form of an illusory magnetic force between the brush
moving in mid-air and the owned artificial hand.
The behavioral evidence for the existence of a functional repre-
sentation of peripersonal space in humans draws primarily from
neuropsychological studies of patients with deficits that manifest
after brain lesions (Brozzoli, Ehrsson, & Farnè, 2014; Làdavas &
Farnè, 2004). For instance, it has been shown that spatial neglect
can selectively affect the space near or far from the body (Cowey,
Small, & Ellis, 1994; Halligan & Marshall, 1991) and that cross-
modal extinction, i.e., the failure to perceive a sensory stimulus
in the contralesional space when a stimulus in another sensory
modality is presented in the ipsilesional space, can be specific to
the space near the patient’s body (di Pellegrino, Làdavas, & Farné,
1997). Similar cross-modal interference effects specific to the
near-personal space have been observed in healthy participants
performing a visuo-tactile congruency task (Holmes, Calvert, &
Spence, 2004; Serino, Canzoneri, & Avenanti, 2011; Spence,
Pavani, & Driver, 2004; Spence, Pavani, Maravita, & Holmes,
2004). As discussed above, the behavioral properties of the rubber
hand illusion in terms of the maximal distance between the real
hand and the rubber hand (Kalckert & Ehrsson, 2014; Lloyd,
2007) and the anatomical spatial congruence (Ehrsson et al.,
2004; Farnè, Pavani, Meneghello, & Làdavas, 2000; Pavani et al.,
2000; Tsakiris & Haggard, 2005) imply the involvement of a
hand-centered representation of peripersonal space. Notably, how-
ever, none of the above-mentioned experimental paradigms allow
the patient or participant to consciously perceive a specific
extended perceptual ‘‘object” (i.e., the force field) that corresponds
to visuo-tactile integration in peripersonal space. Instead, they
show that the integration of signals from different sensory modal-
ities is facilitated within near-personal space, which is quantifiable
through indirect measures, such as differences in reaction time
(Spence, Pavani, & Driver, 2004; Spence, Pavani, Maravita, et al.,
2004). The magnetic touch illusion probably reflects a similar facil-
itation of multisensory integration within peripersonal space;
namely, the integration of visual signals from the brush moving
in mid-air and spatio-temporally congruent tactile signals but with
the important addition that it is a conscious perceptual effect and
thus is introspectively accessible to the participant, even allowing
an individual to readily report the spatial limits of the illusory
force-fields on a single-trial basis (see the results of Experiment
4). This feature constitutes a major practical advantage compared
with previous paradigms, such as the cross-modal congruency
task, in which the near-specific effect on reaction times is
(most probably) subconscious and is usually presented at the
54
A. Guterstam et al. / Cognition 155 (2016) 44–56
 group-level (Farnè, Demattè, & Làdavas, 2003; Spence, Pavani,
Maravita, et al., 2004). In light of the above, we propose that the
magnetic touch illusion constitutes a powerful new experimental
tool for investigating the representation of peripersonal space in
humans, possibly constituting a perceptual correlate of activity in
populations of perihand neurons with visuo-tactile RFs. However,
it should be noted that the present work is limited to the context
of illusory ownership of an artificial limb, and whether the illusion
can also occur for the real hand remains unexplored. On the basis
of the notion that multisensory peripersonal space mechanisms
are involved in self-attributing not only artificial limbs but also
one’s real body parts (Brozzoli et al., 2011; Gentile, Guterstam,
Brozzoli, & Ehrsson, 2013), we hypothesize that the magnetic touch
illusion will be inducible for the real hand as well. Furthermore, in
line with previous behavioral studies, we predict that the strength
of the magnetic touch sensation in patients with extinction will be
reduced in their contralesional space when competing visual or
tactile stimuli are presented in their ipsilesional space.
The results of Experiments 3a and 3b showed that the magnetic
touch sensation is disrupted by the introduction of a metal block
between the brush and the rubber hand; these results have impli-
cations for understanding of the effects of physical barriers on the
spatial extension of peripersonal space. The literature surrounding
this issue is ambiguous. Previous studies have shown that the per-
ihand space is dynamically updated after active tool use (Farnè &
Làdavas, 2000; Iriki, Tanaka, & Iwamura, 1996; Maravita, Spence,
Kennett, & Driver, 2002; but see Holmes, 2012 for a critical view)
and that the responses of mirror neurons with multisensory
peripersonal space properties are affected by the introduction of
a transparent barrier close to the hand (Caggiano, Fogassi,
Rizzolatti, Thier, & Casile, 2009), thus supporting a restricting effect
of barriers on peripersonal space. In contrast, neuropsychological
studies in brain-damaged and healthy participants using cross-
modal interaction tasks have found no effect of transparent barri-
ers on near-far-dependent visuo-tactile facilitation or extinction
(Farnè et al., 2003; Kitagawa & Spence, 2004). We speculate that
the restrictive barrier effect observed in the present study might
be related to our use of a thick barrier made out of metal. Whereas
both metal and transparent Plexiglas barriers (Farnè et al., 2003;
Kitagawa & Spence, 2004) affect the participants’ top-down knowl-
edge of the possibility for the visual stimulus to reach the seen
hand, a metal barrier also constitutes a salient bottom-up cue for
the physical impossibility of the visual stimulus coming into con-
tact with the hand. We speculate that this property is key for the
modulating effect of physical barriers on peripersonal space to
occur and predict that the magnetic touch illusion will be able to
penetrate transparent barriers.
In light of a previous study claiming that ownership of an arti-
ficial limb can be induced by merely moving a brush toward the
rubber hand in perihand space without touching the participant’s
real hand (Ferri et al., 2013), we undertook Experiments 2a and
2b to exclude the possibility that our results might be explained
by such ‘‘expectation effects”. In the study by Ferri and colleagues,
the participants viewed the experimenter’s hand slowly approach-
ing a fully visible rubber hand from above while their real hand
was hidden from view. This setup led to a strong sense of rubber
hand ownership as judged from the reported questionnaire data,
but no apparent sense of magnetic touch (Ferri et al., 2013). Our
results clearly demonstrate that the magnetic touch illusion cannot
be induced by ‘‘tactile expectation” alone and that it is indeed
dependent on concurrent tactile stimulation. Moreover, we were
unable to replicate the basic effect described by Ferri and col-
leagues, because neither the rubber hand ownership ratings nor
the proprioceptive drift in the tactile expectation condition (visual
only, approaching brush) differed significantly from the control con-
dition in which the participants simply looked at the rubber hand
(visual only, static brush; Experiments 2a and 2b). We matched the
key aspects of the previous study and consider it to be unlikely that
the rubber hand in our study being displaced horizontally and not
vertically with respect to the real hand (Ferri et al., 2013) could
explain the absence of any expectation effects, because previous
studies have demonstrated that the rubber hand illusion can be
robustly elicited using either spatial arrangement (Botvinick &
Cohen, 1998; Ehrsson et al., 2004). It also appears improbable that
our use of a slightly different visual stimulus, namely the experi-
menter’s hand holding a paintbrush and making small tapping
movements while approaching the rubber hand, as compared with
Ferri et al. (2013), in which the experimenter’s hand made a con-
tinuous movement toward the rubber hand without holding a
brush, could explain the differences in the results because of two
main reasons. First, both visual stimuli represent objects approach-
ing the rubber hand and should thus, in theory, induce ‘‘tactile
expectations” (Ferri et al., 2013). Second, earlier work has shown
that the rubber hand illusion can be elicited using a wide range
of visual stimuli, including taps and strokes of varying lengths
and trajectories using paintbrushes (Botvinick & Cohen, 1998;
Costantini & Haggard, 2007; Ehrsson et al., 2004), fingers (Hohwy
& Paton, 2010), balls (Brozzoli et al., 2012), ice cubes (Kanaya,
Matsushima, & Yokosawa, 2012), or even laser pointer light beams
(Durgin, Evans, Dunphy, Klostermann, & Simmons, 2007), thus
implying that the ownership-illusion is relatively insensitive to
the precise visual stimuli used. These results suggest that congru-
ent signals from at least two sensory modalities are necessary to
elicit the rubber hand illusion, and the presentation of a visual
stimulus in the space near an artificial hand alone is insufficient
for ownership sensations to arise. Future studies are needed to
exclude cognitive bias, suggestibility and task compliance as expla-
nations of the tactile expectation results presented by Ferri and
colleagues.
In conclusion, this study characterized a perceptual illusion in
which healthy individuals experience a magnetic force between
an artificial hand and an object moving in its surrounding visual
space. The results suggest that the illusion is confined to the space
close to the hand and is dependent on visuo-tactile integration
mechanisms operating in hand-centered spatial reference frames.
The present findings offer an important advancement in under-
standing of the relationship between the representation of periper-
sonal space and the sense of body ownership—two processes
related to the construction of a multisensory boundary separating
the body from the external environment.
