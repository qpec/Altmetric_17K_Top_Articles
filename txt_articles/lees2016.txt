IMPORTANCE Catechol O-methyltransferase (COMT) inhibitors are an established treatment
for end-of-dose motor fluctuations associated with levodopa therapy in patients with
Parkinson disease (PD). Current COMT inhibitors carry a high risk for toxic effects to hepatic
cells or show moderate improvement. Opicapone was designed to be effective without the
adverse effects.
OBJECTIVE To evaluate the efficacy and safety of 25- and 50-mg/d dosages of opicapone
compared with placebo as adjunct to levodopa therapy in patients with PD experiencing
end-of-dose motor fluctuations.
DESIGN This phase 3 international, multicenter outpatient study evaluated a 25- and a
50-mg/d dosage of opicapone in a randomized, double-blind, 14- to 15-week,
placebo-controlled clinical trial, followed by a 1-year open-label phase during which all
patients received active treatment with opicapone. Patients with PD who experienced signs
of end-of-dose deterioration and had a mean total awake off-time (state of akinesia or
decreased mobility) of at least 1.5 hours, not including morning akinesia, were enrolled. Data
were collected from March 18, 2011, through June 25, 2013. Data from the evaluable
population were analyzed from July 31, 2013, to July 31, 2014.
MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES The primary efficacy outcome of the double-blind phase
was the change from baseline in absolute off-time vs placebo based on patient diaries. The
open-label phase focused on maintenance of treatment effect in off-time.
RESULTS A total of 427 patients (258 men [60.4%] and 169 women [39.6%]; mean [SD] age,
63.1 [8.8] years) were randomized to a 25-mg/d (n = 129) or a 50-mg/d (n = 154) dosage of
opicapone or to placebo (n = 144). Of these, 376 patients completed the double-blind phase
and entered the open-label phase, of whom 286 completed 1 year of open-label treatment. At
the end of the double-blind phase, the least squares mean change (SE) in off-time was
−64.5 (14.4) minutes for the placebo group, −101.7 (14.9) minutes for the 25-mg/d opicapone
group, and −118.8 (13.8) minutes for the 50-mg/d opicapone group. The adjusted treatment
difference vs placebo was significant for the 50-mg/d opicapone group (treatment effect,
−54.3 [95% CI, −96.2 to −12.4] minutes; P = .008), but not for the 25-mg/d opicapone group
(treatment effect, −37.2 [95% CI, −80.8 to 6.4] minutes; P = .11). The off-time reduction was
sustained throughout the open-label phase (−126.3 minutes at 1-year open-label end point). The
most common adverse events in the opicapone vs placebo groups were dyskinesia,
constipation, and dry mouth. Fifty-one patients (11.9%) discontinued from the study during the
double-blind phase.
CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE Treatment with a 50-mg once-daily dose of opicapone was
associated with a significant reduction in mean daily off-time in levodopa-treated patients
with PD and motor fluctuations, and this effect is maintained for at least 1 year. Opicapone
was safe and well tolerated.

C
atechol O-methyltransferase (COMT) inhibitors are an
established treatment for motor fluctuations associ-
ated with levodopa therapy. Two COMT inhibitors are
currentlyavailableforclinicaluse.Tolcaponewaswidelyused,
but owing to the risk for potentially fatal hepatic toxic ef-
fects, its clinical use now requires regular liver function moni-
toring and is only considered in patients who have failed to re-
spond to entacapone.1,2 Entacapone is considered safer, but
gains in daily on-time (the state of adequate control of symp-
toms) are moderate (mean of 0.6 hours across randomized
trials3). Thus, a more effective COMT inhibitor that can be eas-
ily used in routine clinical practice is needed.4
Opicapone was rationally designed to provide high COMT
inhibitory potency and avoid toxic effects to cells.5 Opica-
pone has a very high binding affinity that translates into a slow
complex dissociation rate constant and a long duration of ac-
tion that allows once-daily dosing.6
Methods
Study Conduct
This randomized clinical double-blind placebo-controlled trial
evaluated the efficacy and safety of opicapone (25 and 50 mg
once daily) as adjunct to levodopa therapy, followed by a 1-year
open-label phase during which all patients received opica-
pone. The study was conducted from March 18, 2011, through
June25,2013.Thedouble-blindphasewasconductedat71cen-
ters across 12 countries (region 1: Belgium, United Kingdom,
and Israel; region 2: Estonia, Czech Republic, and Russia; re-
gion 3: South Africa, Australia, and South Korea, region 4: In-
dia; region 5: Argentina and Chile), and the open-label phase
was conducted at 64 sites (excluding those in the Czech Re-
public). Institutional review boards at the participating sites
approved the protocol (available in Supplement 1); a list of in-
stitutional review boards is available in eTable 1 in Supplement
2), and the trial was conducted in accordance with the decla-
ration of Helsinki7 and International Conference on Harmo-
nization Good Clinical Practice Guidelines.8 All patients pro-
vided written informed consent.
Study Population
Adult men or women (aged 30-83 years) were eligible if they
had a clinical diagnosis of Parkinson disease (PD)9 for at least
3 years, a Hoehn-Yahr stage10 of 1 to 3 (on stage, or mild uni-
lateraldiseasetomildtomoderatebilateraldisease),andatleast
a 1-year history of clinical improvement with levodopa and/or
dopa decarboxylase inhibitor (levodopa/DDCI) therapy. Pa-
tients had to have received a stable optimized regimen of 3 to
8 daily doses of levodopa/DDCI therapy and other PD medi-
cations for at least 4 weeks before screening. All patients had
signs of end-of-dose deterioration for at least 4 weeks before
screening, with a mean total awake off-time (state of akinesia
or decreased mobility) of at least 1.5 hours, excluding morn-
ing akinesia. Patients had to keep reliable diaries; only pa-
tients who had filled-in self-rating diary charts in accordance
with instructions and had no more than 3 errors per day in the
3 days before the baseline visit were randomized.
Keyexclusioncriteriaincludedadyskinesiadisabilityscore
greaterthan3onitem33oftheUnifiedParkinson’
sDiseaseRat-
ing Scale (UPDRS) (range, 0-4, with higher scores indicating
severely or completely disabling dyskinesia),11 severe and/or
unpredictable off-periods, previous surgery or deep brain
stimulation for PD, history of neuroleptic malignant syn-
drome or nontraumatic rhabdomyolysis, or any medical con-
dition that might interfere with assessments, including de-
mentia, clinically significant cardiovascular disease, or
psychiatric illness. Patients with a history of liver disease or
who had abnormal levels of liver enzymes (alanine amino-
transferase and/or aspartate aminotransferase) more than 2
times the upper normal limit at the screening visit were also
excluded. Concomitant stable treatment for PD was allowed,
with the exception of entacapone, tolcapone, and apomor-
phine hydrochloride (withdrawn ≥1 month before screen-
ing). Treatment with neuroleptics, venlafaxine hydrochlo-
ride, monoamine oxidase inhibitors (except selegiline
hydrochloride, ≤10 mg/d in oral formulation or 1.25 mg/d in
buccal formulation, and rasagiline mesylate, ≤1 mg/d), or an-
tiemetics with antidopaminergic action (except domperi-
done) was prohibited during the study (withdrawn ≥1 month
before screening).
Study Design
Eligible patients were randomized at baseline to the double-
blind phase using a computer-generated scheme (adminis-
tered by Cenduit, LLC) in a ratio of 1:1:1 to the addition of oral
opicapone, 25 mg/d or 50 mg/d, or matching placebo using
blocks stratified by region (Figure). Depending on the need for
levodopa/DDCI therapy adjustment, the first efficacy assess-
ment could occur from 3 to 4 weeks after baseline. Thereaf-
ter,double-blindassessmentsoccurredat4-weekintervals,and
the total duration of the double-blind phase could be 14 to 15
weeks. The open-label phase began the day after completing
the double-blind phase and continued until the patient had
completed 52 weeks of open-label treatment.
Study Medications
Study medication was taken in the evening, at least 1 hour af-
ter the last dose of levodopa/DDCI. In the double-blind phase,
reductions in the daily dose (but not frequency) of levodopa/
DDCI could be made between baseline and 3 to 4 weeks after
Key Points
Question How effective and safe is opicapone when given as
adjunct to levodopa therapy in patients with Parkinson disease
who experience motor fluctuations?
Findings In this randomized clinical trial of 427 patients, a
50-mg/d but not a 25-mg/d dosage of opicapone was associated
with a significant reduction in off-time vs placebo (treatment
effect, −54.31 minutes). This off-time reduction was sustained
throughout the 1-year open-label extension study.
Meaning The efficacy and safety of a 50-mg/d dosage of
opicapone compares well with currently available catechol
O-methyltransferase inhibitors.

baseline according to the clinical response but were not per-
mitted thereafter. Patients started open-label treatment with
the 25-mg/d dosage of opicapone, which could be titrated up
to 50 mg/d if greater symptomatic control was required. If un-
acceptable dopaminergic adverse events appeared, investiga-
tors could first lower the levodopa dosage and then, if this was
not sufficient, the opicapone dosage could be reduced. Doses
of levodopa and opicapone had to remain stable during the last
month of study.
Assessments
Primary and key secondary efficacy variables were assessed
using24-hourpatientdiaries12inwhichpatientsrecordedtheir
status as off, on with troublesome dyskinesia, on with non-
troublesome dyskinesia, on without dyskinesia, or asleep for
every 30-minute interval during the day for 3 consecutive days
before each visit. Patients were trained to identify whether a
30-minute period was spent as mostly on or mostly off. Off-
and on-times at each visit were calculated as the mean of the
3 preceding diary days. The proportion of off- and on-time re-
sponders per treatment group (proportion of patients with a
decrease of ≥1 hour off-time or an increase of ≥1 hour on-
time) was also analyzed. Patients also underwent assessment
in the on state using the UPDRS,11 with part II (activities of daily
living) completed in the on and off states. Additional out-
come measures were the Parkinson’
s Disease Sleep Scale
(PDSS),13 the 39-item Parkinson’
s Disease Questionnaire
(PDQ-39),14 the Non-Motor Symptoms Scale (NMSS),15 and the

biostatisticianattendedmeetingstoansweranyquestions).Ad-
verse events, vital signs, and safety laboratory tests were as-
sessed throughout the study. In addition, the Columbia–
Suicide Severity Rating Scale17 and the Modified Minnesota
Impulsive Disorders Interview18 were also assessed.
Statistical Analyses
Data were analyzed from July 1, 2013, to July 1, 2014. Popula-
tions undergoing analysis included the double-blind full-
analysis set of all randomized patients who took at least 1 dose
of study medication and had at least 1 postbaseline off-time
assessment; the open-label full-analysis set of all patients who
received at least 1 dose of study treatment in the open-label
period and had at least 1 off-time efficacy assessment in the
open-label period; and the safety set of all patients who re-
ceived at least 1 dose of study medication.
The primary efficacy variable for the double-blind phase
was the change from baseline in absolute off-time, which was
analyzed in the double-blind full-analysis set using an analy-
sis of covariance with treatment group and region included as
factors and baseline off-time as a covariate. A Dunnett α level
adjustment was used for the comparison of each active dose
group with placebo, and the last observation carried forward
method was used to handle missing diary data.
ToavoidinflationoftypeIerrors,keysecondaryendpoints
in the double-blind phase were analyzed according to the fol-
lowing predefined hierarchy: the proportions of patients
achieving at least a 1-hour reduction in absolute off-time and
the proportions of patients achieving at least a 1-hour in-
creaseinabsoluteon-timeattheendofthedouble-blindphase;
change from baseline to the end of the double-blind phase in
UPDRS motor scores; and change from baseline to the end of
the double-blind phase in absolute total on-time and percent-
age of off-time. A nonsignificant result in any of these hierar-
chicaltestsmeantthatalltestsperformedbelowthatpointwere
considered exploratory. Other scale-based efficacy outcomes
were the change from baseline to the end of the double-blind
phaseinUPDRS,PDSS,PDQ-39,andNMSSscoresandthemean
CGI-C and PGI-C scores at the end of the double-blind phase.
The proportion of off- and on-time responders per treatment
group was compared using a Cochran-Mantel-Haenszel test
withpooledcountryasstrata.TheCGI-CandPGI-Cscoreswere
analyzed using a nonparametric van Elteren test19 for treat-
ment effect stratified by pooled country. Other secondary out-
comes were analyzed in a similar manner to the primary effi-
cacy variable.
Maintenance of treatment effect during the open-label
phase was analyzed through the change from the start to the
end of the open-label phase of absolute off-time using a lin-
ear model with pooled country included as a factor. All safety
analyses were descriptive and performed using the safety set.
Determination of Sample Size
Assuming that the mean reductions in off-time would be 90
and 105 minutes for the opicapone dosages and 30 minutes
for the placebo dosage,20 a total of 135 evaluable patients in
each arm of the double-blind full-analysis set was estimated
to ensure at least 95% power to confirm a treatment effect vs
placebo in the most efficacious opicapone dosage group and
at least 85% power to confirm a treatment effect in the least
efficacious opicapone dosage group.
Results
Patient Disposition
Of the 485 patients screened, 427 were enrolled and random-
ized(258men[60.4%]and169women[39.6%];mean[SD]age,
63.1 [8.8] years). Of these, 376 (88.1% of randomized pa-
tients)completedthedouble-blindphase(Figure).Overall,367
patients who completed the double-blind phase, including 2
patients who had discontinued the double-blind phase early
owing to lack of study medication, entered the open-label
phase, and 286 of these (77.9%) completed 1 year of open-
label treatment. The most common reason for study discon-
tinuation in both phases was adverse events.
Demographics, Baseline Characteristics, and PD Medications
Mostbaselinecharacteristicswerecomparablebetweengroups
(Table 1); however, the placebo group had slightly fewer male
and more Asian patients compared with the active treatment
groups. Patients had a mean (SD) disease duration (time since
diagnosis) ranging from 7.7 (3.7) to 8.5 (4.4) years and had been
receiving levodopa for a mean (SD) of 6.8 (3.6) to 7.2 (4.3) years.
The mean (SD) daily levodopa dose was 700 (312) to 806 (398)
mg and the mean (SD) duration of wearing off was 3.0 (2.3) to
3.2 (3.3) years.
Primary Efficacy Analysis in the Double-Blind Phase
All groups achieved reductions in off-time vs baseline (eFig-
ure in Supplement 2). At the end of the double-blind phase,
the mean (SD) change in off-time was −64.5 (14.4) minutes for
the placebo group, −101.7 (14.9) minutes for the 25-mg/d opi-
capone group, and −118.8 (13.8) minutes for the 50-mg/d opi-
capone group. The adjusted least squares mean change from
baseline in absolute off-time at study end was largest in the
50-mg/d opicapone group. The adjusted treatment differ-
ence compared with the placebo group was significant for the
50-mg/d opicapone group (treatment effect [SD], −54.3 [18.9]
minutes; 95% CI, −96.2 to −12.4 minutes; P = .008), but not
for the 25-mg/d opicapone group (treatment effect [SD], −37.2
[19.6] minutes; 95% CI, −80.8 to 6.4 minutes; P = .11).
Secondary Outcomes in the Double-Blind Phase
Secondary efficacy findings are summarized in Table 2. Com-
pared with the placebo group with off-time response rates of
68 (50.4%) and on-time response rates of 61 (45.2%), the pro-
portion of responders in the full-analysis set was signifi-
cantly higher among the off-time responders in the 25-mg/d
opicapone group (78 [62.4%]; P = .04) and 50-mg/d opica-
pone group (97 [66.0%]; P = .009) and among on-time re-
sponders in the 25-mg/d opicapone group (79 [63.2%];
P = .004) and the 50-mg/d opicapone group (91 [61.9%];
P = .006). Under the hierarchical procedure, the next key sec-
ondary variable to be analyzed was the change from baseline
to the end of double-blind phase in UPDRS motor scores. Mean

(SE) changes in motor function were small and similar across
all groups (−2.1 [0.5] for the placebo group; −2.9 [0.5] for the
25-mg/d opicapone group [P = .26]; −2.0 [0.5] for the 50-
mg/d opicapone group [P = .82]); thus, according to the hier-
archical procedure, all analyses from this point were consid-
ered exploratory.
Other diary-reported secondary efficacy findings sup-
ported those of the primary analysis and confirmed that treat-
ment with opicapone resulted in larger increases in mean (SE)
least squares absolute on-time (58.7 [14.2] minutes in the pla-
cebo group, 104.1 [14.7] minutes in the 25-mg/d opicapone
group [P = .02], and 111.3 [13.7] minutes in the 50-mg/d opi-

[P = .03], and −12.1% [1.4%] in the 50-mg/d opicapone group
[P = .004]) (Table 2). Most of the gain of on-time with opica-
pone was without troublesome dyskinesia; increases in on-
time with troublesome dyskinesia were not significantly dif-
ferent from the placebo group (11.2 minutes) for the 25-mg/d
opicapone group (19.4 minutes; P = .49) or the 50-mg/d opi-
capone group (25.6 minutes; P = .21) (eTable 2 in Supplement
2). The UPDRS total (reduction of −3.5 to −4.4 points), UPDRS
activitiesofdailylivingintheoffstate(reductionof−1.9to−2.5
points), UPDRS activities of daily living in the on state (reduc-
tion of −0.5 to −1.0 points), PDSS (increase of 2.3 to 5.1 points),
PDQ-39 (reduction of −2.6 to −4.8 points), NMSS (reduction of
−2.0 to −5.2 points), CGI-C (increase of 3.2 to 3.5 points), and
PGI-C (increase of 3.2 to 3.5 points) assessments showed some
improvements across all treatment groups, with no signifi-
cant differences among them.
Maintenance of Treatment Effect in the Open-Label Phase
Off-time reduction from the double-blind baseline was sus-
tained during the open-label phase; the adjusted mean change
from the start to the end of the open-label phase in off-time
was −18.31 (95% CI, −43.56 to 6.95) minutes. Mean (SD) total
on-time increased by 24.9 (156.4) minutes, and this increase

Levodopa Dosage Reductions
At the end of the permitted adjustment period (first 2-3 weeks
of the double-blind phase), the overall levodopa dose de-
creased by a mean of 47.2 mg in the 25-mg/d opicapone group
and 29.3 mg in the 50-mg/d opicapone group compared with
9.4 mg in the placebo group. At the end of the double-blind
phase, the mean levodopa doses were 762.5 mg in the 25-
mg/d opicapone group, 674.3 mg in the 50-mg/d opicapone
group, and 713.3 mg in the placebo group.

Duringtheopen-labelphase,themeandailylevodopadose
was maintained below the baseline value, with 213 of 339 pa-
tients (62.8%) continuing to receive the same dose of le-
vodopa. The mean (SD) number of daily levodopa doses also
remained stable during this phase, ranging from 4.69 (1.54) to
4.76 (1.56) during the course of the year. Overall, 40 of 339 pa-
tients (11.8%) had a reduction of the levodopa dose between
the open-label baseline and the end of study. At the end of the
open-label phase, the mean levodopa dose was 693.9 mg, a de-
crease of 35.6 mg vs the double-blind baseline.
Safety and Tolerability
More than half of patients in each group (total, 282 of 411
patients [68.6%]) experienced at least 1 adverse event
(Table 3), which was usually mild or moderate in intensity. In
the double-blind phase, the most common adverse events
occurring in the opicapone groups compared with the pla-
cebo group were dyskinesia, constipation, and dry mouth.
Most of the dyskinesia events (58 [75.3%]) across all groups
occurred in patients already experiencing dyskinesia at base-
line. Serious adverse events were observed in 18 patients
(4.4%) in the double-blind phase and in 40 of 353 patients
(11.3%) in the open-label phase (Table 3). One death (due to
pneumonia in the placebo group) occurred in the double-
blind phase and 5 deaths (due to septic shock, small cell lung
cancer, cerebral hemorrhage after traumatic brain injury,
cerebral hemorrhage, and an unknown cause) occurred in the
open-label phase.
In the double-blind phase, discontinuations due to ad-
verse events were more frequent for the 50-mg/d opicapone
group (17 of 150 [11.3%]) than for the 25-mg/d opicapone group
(5of125[4.0%])ortheplacebogroup(9of136[6.6%])(Table4).
The most common adverse event leading to study discontinu-
ation was dyskinesia (4 patients in the 50-mg/d opicapone
group; 1 patient in the placebo group; and none in the 25-
mg/d opicapone group). Other adverse events leading to study
discontinuation were reported in 26 patients (6.1%); no pa-
tient discontinued study participation owing to diarrhea.
Thirty-two patients (9.1%) discontinued because of an ad-
verseeventduringtheopen-labelphase.Inthisphase,themost
common treatment-related reasons for study discontinua-
tions were dopaminergic events (3 patients [0.8%] for dyski-
nesia, 3 [0.8%] for hallucinations, and 1 [0.3%] for orthostatic
hypotension) and aggravation of PD (2 [0.5%]).

Discussion
Inthisphase3study,once-dailytreatmentwithopicaponewas
well tolerated and was associated with significant therapeu-
tic benefits in patients with PD who experienced motor fluc-
tuations, despite current treatment with levodopa and other
adjunct PD medications. The change from baseline in abso-
lute off-time at the end of the double-blind phase showed a
significant improvement compared with placebo in the 50-
mg/d opicapone group, and the benefits of off-time reduc-
tion were sustained throughout the 1-year open-label phase.
Although we found greater reductions of off-time with the 25-
mg/d opicapone group, the treatment differences were not sig-
nificant compared with the placebo group. This finding may
result from the higher-than-expected placebo effects that oc-
curred in this study. The sample size of 135 patients per arm
was calculated under the assumption of a much lower pla-
cebo response (30 minutes) than was actually achieved (64.5
minutes), suggesting that the study may have been under-
powered to detect differences between groups.
The present results are similar to those of another phase
3 study,21 which also showed that treatment with opicapone
effectivelyreducedoff-timeandincreasedon-timewithoutin-
creasing the frequency of troublesome dyskinesia. In that
study, the 50-mg/d dosage was also demonstrated to be non-
inferior to adjunct entacapone treatment, which was in-
cluded as an active comparator.21 Likewise, the reductions in
off-timeseeninthepresentstudyalsocomparewellwiththose
of other studies22-25 of adjunct therapy for motor complica-
tions in PD. Patients receiving the 50-mg/d dosage had a mean
off-time reduction of 54.3 minutes vs placebo, which is higher
than the mean of 0.6 hour (36 minutes) reported for the en-
tacapone studies (which had broadly similar study designs to
this study),3 and which is more similar to off-time reductions
reported for other adjuvant treatments such as dopamine
agonists.3,26 The similarity of the phase 3 opicapone trial de-
signs will allow meta-analyses of effect sizes to be per-
formed, facilitating our understanding the efficacy of opica-
pone in all outcome measures.
Although UPDRS motor function and other scale-based
measures, including nonmotor symptoms and quality of life,
all improved during the double-blind phase, we found no sig-
nificant differences between groups. This result may be be-
cause the patients were already receiving levodopa treat-
mentforsymptomaticcontrolandthestudywasonlydesigned
and powered to address a potential differentiation in motor
fluctuations. By the end of the open-label phase, mean PDSS,
NMSS, and PDQ-39 scores maintained an overall improve-
ment relative to the double-blind baseline scores (eTable 3 in
Supplement 2). Because patients with PD and motor fluctua-
tions often require frequent medication changes, it is note-
worthy that most patients maintained the levodopa dose and
dosing frequency from the end of the titration phase through-
out the duration of the study, which can be considered an ad-
ditional indicator of sustained control of motor fluctuations
during the long term.
Opicapone was well tolerated with no apparent dose-
relationship for the most of the adverse events. In the double-
blind phase, the most common adverse events associated with
opicaponetreatment(dyskinesia,constipation,anddrymouth)
reflected greater dopaminergic availability. Toxic effects to the
liver have prevented the clinical use of tolcapone and devel-
opment of other COMT inhibitors. We therefore are reassured
that no relevant liver issues were observed with opicapone.
Similarly, diarrhea has been considered a class effect of COMT
inhibition,27,28 but this adverse event was absent from both
phases of the study, and no cases of severe diarrhea were re-
ported with opicapone treatment. The continued tolerability
of the drug during the open-label phase is supported by the
low rate of patients who prematurely withdrew because of an
adverse event (32 patients).
Conclusions
Treatmentwithopicaponeeffectivelyreducedoff-timeandin-
creased on-time without increasing the frequency of trouble-
some dyskinesia, and this benefit was maintained for at least
1 year of therapy without increasing the levodopa dose. The
magnitude of treatment effect with the 50-mg/d dosage of opi-
capone is considered clinically relevant,29 with approxi-
mately 1 hour of reduction in off-time. The simplicity af-
forded by the once-daily administration means that addition
of this drug will not further complicate the patients’current
drug regimen, while allowing more sophisticated adjust-
ments to the levodopa regimen that are harder to achieve, in
practice,whengivinglevodopainacombinedpillwithaCOMT
inhibitor (even taking into consideration the number of dose
availabilities for the combined pill). When combined with the
favorable safety and tolerability profile, these characteristics
position opicapone as a strong candidate for the adjunct treat-
ment of motor fluctuations in PD.
