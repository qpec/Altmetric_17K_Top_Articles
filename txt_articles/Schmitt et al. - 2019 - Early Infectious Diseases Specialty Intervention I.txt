Background. Intervention by infectious diseases (ID) physicians improves outcomes for inpatients in Medicare, but patients 
with other insurance types could fare differently. We assessed whether ID involvement leads to better outcomes among privately 
insured patients under age 65 years hospitalized with common infections.
Methods. We performed a retrospective analysis of administrative claims data from community hospital and postdischarge 
ambulatory care. Patients were privately insured individuals less than 65 years old with an acute-care stay in 2014 for selected infec-
tions, classed as having early (by day 3) or late (after day 3) ID intervention, or none. Key outcomes were mortality, cost, length of 
the index stay, readmission rate, mortality, and total cost of care over the first 30 days after discharge.
Results. Patients managed with early ID involvement had shorter length of stay, lower spending, and lower mortality in the 
index stay than those patients managed without ID involvement. Relative to late, early ID involvement was associated with shorter 
length of stay and lower cost. Individuals with early ID intervention during hospitalization had fewer readmissions and lower health-
care payments after discharge. Relative to late, those with early ID intervention experienced lower readmission, lower spending, and 
lower mortality.
Conclusions. Among privately insured patients less than 65 years old, treated in a hospital, early intervention with an ID phy-
sician was associated with lower mortality rate and shorter length of stay. Patients who received early ID intervention during their 
hospital stay were less likely to be readmitted after discharge and had lower total healthcare spending.
Keywords. costs; infectious diseases; patient outcomes; utilization; mortality.
Infectious diseases are a major cause of morbidity and mortality 
across all age groups. Physicians from multiple disciplines may 
participate in the care of patients with serious infections. There 
is an evolving body of literature suggesting that consultation by 
an Infectious Diseases (ID) physician contributes to positive 
health outcomes for common and serious infections.
In meta-analysis of 18 studies of hospitalized patients treated 
for Staphylococcus aureus bacteremia, patients who received ID 
intervention experienced lower 30-day mortality (relative risk 
[RR] 0.53, 95% confidence interval [CI] 0.43–0.65) and lower 
relapse rates (RR 0.62, 95% CI 0.39–0.99) [1]. In another study, 
ID intervention was associated with a 40% to 50% reduction 
in hospital- and 30-day mortality [2]. Similarly, among solid- 
organ-transplant recipients hospitalized for infection at 1 cen-
ter, those receiving ID intervention had higher 28-day survival 
(hazard ratio 0.33) and reduced 30-day readmission rates (17% 
vs 24%) [3].
Schmitt et al [4] reviewed Medicare claims data for people 
with any of 11 infections. ID involvement was associated with 
lower mortality and lower costs. Initial ID intervention within 
2 days of admission was associated with better clinical outcomes 
than later involvement, although not with differences in cost or 
length of stay (LOS).
Previous studies in the United States have been limited to 
individual centers, infections, or to Medicare recipients. The 
current study extends them by assessing results associated with 
ID care in the general hospital population for privately insured 
individuals less than 65 years of age.

METHODS
Study Design
We performed a retrospective analysis of administrative claims 
data. The study population consisted of individuals with any of a 
broad range of common infections, divided into 3 groups: those 
without ID physician intervention during the hospital stay, 
those with ID intervention early in the stay, and those with ID 
intervention later in the stay. Two sets of propensity-matched 
cohorts were developed: those with early intervention or no 
ID intervention, and those with early or later ID interven-
tion. Using those pairs of cohorts, we then studied the relation 
between early ID intervention and health outcomes during the 
initial hospitalization and in the 30 days afterward.
Data Source
Analyses were performed on administrative claims from 
the Truven Health MarketScan™ Research Databases. The 
MarketScan Commercial Database contains the eligibility, inpa-
tient, outpatient, and outpatient prescription-drug experience 
of employees and their dependents, covered under a variety 
of fee-for-service and capitated health plans. The MarketScan 
Medicare Supplemental Database contains the healthcare expe-
rience of individuals with Medicare supplemental insurance 
paid for by employers. Together they had over 30 million cov-
ered lives in 2014. We extracted claims from each database for 
events occurring between July 2012 and December 2014. All 
index events occurred in 2013 or 2014.
Inclusion and Exclusion Criteria
Index events consisted of inpatient stays in acute-care hospitals 
with a primary or secondary discharge diagnosis of any of the 
following: bacterial endocarditis, bacteremia, central-line-as-
sociated bloodstream infection (CLABSI), Clostridium difficile 
infection, meningitis, osteomyelitis, prosthetic joint infection, 
septic arthritis, septic shock, or vascular device infection. These 
were selected primarily on the basis of severity, frequency of 
occurrence, and the ability to clearly identify patients with these 
infections using ICD-9-CM codes.
Associated ICD-9-CM diagnosis codes appear in the 
Supplementary Appendix. A single patient could appear more 
than once in the data. Other inclusion criteria included con-
tinuous enrollment in the same health insurance plan for the 
6 months prior to admission and for 30 days beyond discharge, 
medical or surgical admission type, and age less than 65 years 
at time of admission.
The age restriction excluded most Medicare recipients 
because enrollment before age 65 is limited to individuals with 
severe and persistent disability, less common in a data set of 
employed people and their dependents. Such patients appear in 
the MarketScan data if they also carried a Medicare supplemen-
tal insurance plan, in which case we observed the claims paid 
by that plan.
We also excluded patients if any of the following crite-
ria applied: an acute-care hospitalization for any cause in the 
30 days prior to the index stay, an acute-care hospitalization for 
the same cause as the index stay in the 6 months prior to the 
index stay, or discharge to another acute-care hospital from the 
index stay.
Variables
The initial analytic file included patient age group, sex, census 
division of the hospital, index stay type (medical or surgical), 
and whether the index stay was an observation stay. Several 
variables captured clinical characteristics of the index stay: 
infection (among those in Table 1), major diagnosis category 
(MDC), Elixhauser comorbidity index as modified by Quan et al 
[5], number of 3-digit ICD-9-CM discharge diagnoses assigned, 
number of types of physician specialists consulted (a maximum 
of 27; see Supplementary Appendix for details), number of sep-
arate days on which the patient had an ID physician encounter, 
discharge status, average number of nonhospitalist encounters 
per day (expressed as deciles of that distribution), and whether 
the stay included time in intensive care. Payment models also 
featured an indicator of enrollment in a capitated health plan.
The key variable was intervention by an ID physician no 
later than the third day of the index stay, which we term “early 
intervention.” Alternatives were later ID intervention, or none. 
The cutoff of 3 days was determined a priori by the investi-
gators because the empiric choice of antimicrobial manage-
ment and diagnostic testing with early ID interventions will 
likely have the greatest impact on the predetermined health 
outcomes.
We grouped age into 5 categories (0–17, 18–44, 45–54, 55–59, 
60–64), and the Elixhauser comorbidity index was grouped 
into 4 (<0, 0–3, >3–8, >8). Negative values occur because some 
Elixhauser groups, such as obesity and depression, are assigned 
negative weights in the scoring algorithm [6]. Cost equaled the 
sum of payments by all payers, including the patient. A hospital 
was indicated as rural if it was located outside a metropolitan 
statistical area. Payment models also featured an indicator of 
enrollment in a capitated health plan.
Outcome variables were assessed during the index stay or 
the first 30 days after discharge. Outcomes for the index stay 
included mortality, length of stay, and cost. Postdischarge out-
comes included mortality, hospital readmission for any cause, 
probability of any healthcare spending, and cost among those 
with postdischarge spending.
We performed analyses on 2 cohorts. The first, termed “early/
none,” consisted of people with early ID intervention and an 
equal number with no ID intervention at any time. A second, 
“early/late” cohort was composed of people with an early ID 
intervention and an equal number who had later ID interven-
tion, defined as the 4th day or later. An individual with early ID 
intervention could appear in both cohorts.

To create each cohort, we used logistic regression to predict 
the likelihood of ID intervention. Regressors included the initial 
infection, Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality comor-
bidity indicators, the Charlson comorbidity index based on the 
6 months prior to the index stay, patient age category, and sex, 
type of index stay, the rural status and geographic region of the 
hospital, and indicators for infection with methicillin-resistant 
Staphylococcus aureus, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, and tubercu-
losis. The predicted likelihood of ID intervention for each case 
represented its propensity score. To create a balanced cohort, 
we matched cases 1-to-1 through nearest-neighbor matching 
without replacement, with a maximum difference in propen-
sity score (caliper) of 0.03. Balance across matched cohorts was 
assessed by paired t-tests or χ2 tests, standardized mean differ-
ence, and common support.
Statistical Analyses
For each cohort, we developed descriptive statistics for char-
acteristics of the stay, person, and hospital. Separate regression 
models were run for each cohort and each outcome variable: 
logistic models for mortality and readmission models, negative 
binomial models for length of stay, and generalized linear mod-
els with log link and gamma distribution for spending models. 
All analyses were performed using SAS.
Research Ethics
The study funder, Infectious Diseases Society of America, par-
ticipated in the study design and interpretation of results, and 
approved publication. Institutional Review Board approval 
was not required, but the study followed the principles of the 
Declaration of Helsinki.
RESULTS
We identified 76 608 index stays, of which 22 213 (29%) had 
an early ID intervention. Most variables were statistically sig-
nificant in the propensity scoring models (see Supplementary 
Appendix). The matched early/none cohort had 11 438 stays, 
whereas the matched early/late cohort had 28 964. Cohorts were 
well balanced between those with and without early ID inter-
vention. Standardized differences were <0.05 for all variables 
and were <0.04 for all but 2 variables in both cohorts.
Table 1 presents the frequencies of the entry conditions in 
each matched cohort. Some individuals were diagnosed with 
2 or more of these conditions. Bacteremia, osteomyelitis, and 
septic shock were the most common diagnoses. Bacterial endo-
carditis, C. difficile, and septic arthritis each accounted for more 
than 5% of patients in both cohorts. Transplants of heart, kid-
ney, liver, or other solid organs accounted for 4%–6% of cases.
Fewer than 2% of individuals died during the initial hos-
pital stay in both cohorts. Of those who survived, 16% in the 
early/none cohort had an inpatient or ED admission during 
the 30 days after discharge and 23% in the early/late cohort. 
Additional descriptive statistics appear in the Supplementary 
Appendix.
Early/No ID Comparison
Models of the index stay for the early/no ID cohort compari-
son appear in Table 2. Overall, 1.2% of cases ended in hospital 
death. Early ID intervention was associated with lower odds 
of death (odds ratio [OR] 0.658, 95% confidence interval [CI] 
0.446–0.939). A greater number of ID encounters was asso-
ciated with lower mortality (OR 0.970, 95% CI 0.926–0.999). 
Higher mortality was associated with selected MDCs, higher

Elixhauser scores, more diagnoses, more specialist types con-
sulted, and vascular device infection.
Stays with early ID intervention had an almost 23% shorter 
length of stay on average (incidence rate ratio [IRR] 0.772, 
95% CI 0.755–0.790) relative to stays with no ID intervention. 
Longer length of stay was associated with Elixhauser scores 
of 3 or higher, rural location, markers of higher comorbidity 
(more diagnoses, more specialist types consulted, and more 
ID encounters), several different initial infections, and heart 
transplantation.
Similarly, early ID intervention was associated with a 
$10 888 decrement in spending during the index stay (95% CI 
$−11 651.88 to $−10 122.06), relative to stays with no ID inter-
vention. Intensive care unit (ICU) stays and all transplant indi-
cators were associated with much higher spending, as expected. 
In general, variables that predicted longer length of stay also 
predicted higher cost.
Table 3 shows results of 3 regression models of the post-
discharge period for the early/no ID cohort. Dashes indicate 
that a variable had to be dropped for the regression model to 
be estimated. Among those who survived the index stay, early 
ID intervention had a negative but insignificant association 
with postdischarge mortality (OR 0.754, 95% CI 0.468–1.273). 
Likewise, higher numbers of ID encounters were not signifi-
cantly associated with post-discharge mortality (OR 1.010, 
95% CI 0.980–1.039). Higher mortality was associated with 
Elixhauser scores above 3, more diagnoses of any conditions, 
C. difficile infection, and vascular device infection.
Relative to those who had no ID intervention in the index 
stay, those who received early ID intervention had a lower read-
mission rate in the 30 days after discharge (OR 0.804, 95% CI 
0.730–0.885) and lower total payments over that period (ME 
$−1841.54, 95% CI $−2852.14 to $−778.79). Higher readmis-
sion odds were associated with Elixhauser scores above 8, ICU 
stays, rural hospital location, greater comorbidity (more diagno-
ses, more specialist types consulted, and more ID encounters), 
certain diagnoses (bacterial endocarditis, CLABSI, osteomyeli-
tis, and joint infection), and heart and liver transplants. Total 
payments were also much greater following observation stays 
than acute stays, although there was no relation to readmission.
Early/Late Comparison
Tables 4 and 5 present similar figures for analyses of the early/
late ID cohort. During the initial stay, there was no significant 
relation of early ID intervention to mortality. Significant pre-
dictors of higher mortality included comorbidity measures

 Hospital Intervention by ID Physicians • CID 2019:68 (15 January) • 243
(Elixhauser scores above 3, number of diagnoses, number of 
specialist types consulted), ICU stays, and selected diagnoses 
and procedures. Having more ID encounters was associated 
with lower mortality, all else being equal (OR 0.973, 95% CI 
0.939–0.998).
Similarly, early ID intervention was associated with sig-
nificantly lower LOS (IRR 0.710, 0.695–0.796) and an asso-
ciated reduction in the accrued costs (ME $−20 264.59, 95% 
CI $−21 702.94 to $−18 813.11) during the initial stay. Longer 
length of stay and higher cost were significantly related to 
higher comorbidity (higher Elixhauser scores, more diagnoses, 
encounters with more specialist types), more ID encounters, 
having an ICU stay, most transplant types, and diagnoses of 
meningitis or septic shock.
In the 30 days after discharge, early ID intervention was asso-
ciated with significantly lower odds of mortality (OR 0.629, 
95% CI 0.364–0.982), lower odds of readmission (OR 0.816, 
95% CI 0.741–0.898), and lower spending (ME $−2312.19, 95% 
CI $−3409.94 to $−1018.77). Other significant predictors of 
mortality included Elixhauser score >8, number of diagnoses, 
number of ID encounters, and septic shock. A similar pattern 
emerged for readmission. Higher 30-day total payments were 
associated with greater comorbidity (Elixhauser score over 3, 
more diagnoses, encounters with more specialist types, and 
more ID encounters), ICU stay, observation status in the initial 
stay, the West region, CLABSI, and joint infection.
DISCUSSION
This study contributes to the understanding of how ID physi-
cian intervention benefits hospital patients with infection. First, 
although many studies have been limited to S. aureus bactere-
mia [1, 2, 7, 8], here we broaden the focus to include a larger set 
of infectious disease conditions. Second, the current study dis-
tinguishes between later ID intervention and none. Although 
early ID intervention is associated with significant benefits rela-
tive to both other groups, the relative impact is different.
The current study complements earlier findings by Schmitt 
et al [4], which took a similar approach but considered patients 
covered by Medicare, most of whom are at least 65 years of age. 
Two earlier studies considered the impact of ID consultation on 
multiple types of infection and without regard to insurance cov-
erage. One found that patients with solid-organ transplants who 
were hospitalized for infection experienced lower mortality and

 244 • CID 2019:68 (15 January) • Schmitt et al
center who were infected with Candida glabrata, those who 
received ID consultation were more likely to receive appropriate 
antimicrobial therapy; those who had ID consultation within 48 
hours had lower mortality as well [9]. However, these 2 studies 
were limited to a single hospital each, which could limit their 
generalizability.
We lacked the precise clinical data necessary to investigate 
the reasons for the better outcomes observed. Previous studies, 
however, have indicated that when treating infections, partic-
ularly S. aureus bacteremia, ID physicians are more likely than 
other physicians to identify a removable focus of infection [7]. 
They are also more likely to select the most appropriate antimi-
crobial therapy and to prescribe it for optimal duration, which 
in turn can reduce the risk of recurrence and readmission 
 
[1, 2, 7, 10].
Early ID intervention was associated with a much lower 
likelihood of hospital mortality than either late or no ID inter-
vention. The mortality rate in our data—under 1.5% across the 
index stay and postdischarge period—was much lower than has 
been found in studies that focus exclusively on S. aureus (such 
as nearly 20% in Vogel et al [1]). Our data consist of privately 
insured individuals, or their dependents, all of whom were 
less than age 65 years at the time of the index hospitalization. 
They are likely to have fewer comorbid conditions than people 
65 years and older, and in general have markedly lower mortal-
ity rates [11].
Among those who had ID intervention at any time, a greater 
number of ID encounters during an admission appears to be 
a marker of higher acuity. In part this occurs by construction, 
as longer stays have more opportunities for intervention by all 
types of physicians. The association with lower mortality during 
the inpatient stay, though, is consistent with a beneficial impact 
of ID intervention.
Readmissions within 30 days of discharge appeared to be 
concentrated among patients with high levels of comorbidity. 
Three significant predictors in the readmissions model repre-
sent comorbidity: the number of 3-digit discharge diagnoses, an 
Elixhauser score above 8, and the count of specialist types seen 
during the index stay. Combined with the very low mortality in 
the 30 days after discharge, this may be another indication of 
the relatively good health of most individuals in the data prior 
to hospitalization.
We acknowledge several limitations of our analysis. Patients 
were not randomized to early ID intervention, and patients 
within each cohort could differ by unobserved factors that relate 
to the measured outcomes. The definition of early intervention

 Hospital Intervention by ID Physicians • CID 2019:68 (15 January) • 245
was necessarily arbitrary; other periods, such as 2 or 4 full days 
of stay, could lead to new conclusions. Claims data do not cap-
ture clinical situations perfectly, which could lead to misper-
ception of a patient’s clinical acuity. The generalizability of these 
results may be limited due to the inability of the data to answer 
key questions about prognosis and specific patient comorbidi-
ties or characteristics. Nevertheless, we do not expect that any 
inaccuracy varied by whether or when a patient received ID 
intervention. The study was not designed to detect the precise 
components of costs that were saved in infection treatment, and 
delineation of these factors is a topic for future investigation.
CONCLUSION
Among privately insured individuals below the age of 65 years 
treated in a hospital, intervention by an ID physician within 
the first 3 days of stay is associated with lower mortality rate, 
shorter length of stay, and lower costs. Results are broadly sim-
ilar in comparison to people with later ID intervention or to 
people with no ID intervention during the initial stay.
The impact of ID intervention extends beyond the initial hos-
pitalization. Those who received early ID intervention during 
the initial hospital stay were also less likely to be readmitted 
in the 30 days after discharge and had lower total healthcare 
spending over the period, than people with late or no ID inter-
vention. These findings add to the growing body of literature 
illustrating the benefit of early ID intervention on patient out-
comes for a wide range of infections [1, 2, 4, 8, 10].
