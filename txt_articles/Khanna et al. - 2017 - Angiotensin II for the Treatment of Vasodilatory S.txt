BACKGROUND
Vasodilatory shock that does not respond to high-dose vasopressors is associated 
with high mortality. We investigated the effectiveness of angiotensin II for the treat-
ment of patients with this condition.
METHODS
We randomly assigned patients with vasodilatory shock who were receiving more 
than 0.2 μg of norepinephrine per kilogram of body weight per minute or the equiva-
lent dose of another vasopressor to receive infusions of either angiotensin II or pla-
cebo. The primary end point was a response with respect to mean arterial pressure at 
hour 3 after the start of infusion, with response defined as an increase from baseline 
of at least 10 mm Hg or an increase to at least 75 mm Hg, without an increase in the 
dose of background vasopressors.
RESULTS
A total of 344 patients were assigned to one of the two regimens; 321 received a 
study intervention (163 received angiotensin II, and 158 received placebo) and were 
included in the analysis. The primary end point was reached by more patients in 
the angiotensin II group (114 of 163 patients, 69.9%) than in the placebo group 
(37 of 158 patients, 23.4%) (odds ratio, 7.95; 95% confidence interval [CI], 4.76 to 
13.3; P<0.001). At 48 hours, the mean improvement in the cardiovascular Sequential 
Organ Failure Assessment (SOFA) score (scores range from 0 to 4, with higher scores 
indicating more severe dysfunction) was greater in the angiotensin II group than in 
the placebo group (−1.75 vs. −1.28, P 
= 
0.01). Serious adverse events were reported 
in 60.7% of the patients in the angiotensin II group and in 67.1% in the placebo 
group. Death by day 28 occurred in 75 of 163 patients (46%) in the angiotensin II 
group and in 85 of 158 patients (54%) in the placebo group (hazard ratio, 0.78; 
95% CI, 0.57 to 1.07; P 
= 
0.12).
CONCLUSIONS
Angiotensin II effectively increased blood pressure in patients with vasodilatory shock 
that did not respond to high doses of conventional vasopressors. (Funded by La Jolla 
Pharmaceutical Company; ATHOS-3 ClinicalTrials.gov number, NCT02338843.)

The new engl and jour nal of medicine
S
hock is a life-threatening syndrome 
characterized by decreased organ perfusion 
that can progress to irreversible organ fail-
ure.1 Vasodilatory shock is the most common type 
of shock and is characterized by peripheral vaso-
dilation and reduced blood pressure despite pre-
served cardiac output.2 Vasodilatory shock requires 
immediate treatment to ensure organ perfusion 
through the reestablishment of adequate blood 
pressure while the underlying cause of shock is 
identified and treated.3 Vasopressors are used 
when intravenous fluid resuscitation alone fails to 
restore blood pressure. Patients with severe vaso-
dilation who have hypotension despite the use of 
high doses of vasopressors have a poor prognosis, 
with 30-day all-cause mortality exceeding 50%.4,5
Currently, only two classes of vasopressors 
are available: catecholamines (and other sympa-
thomimetic amines) and vasopressin.3 Both 
classes have narrow therapeutic windows owing 
to substantial toxic effects at high doses.6 How-
ever, when hypotension occurs, human physiol-
ogy engages a third system, which is represented 
by hormones in the renin–angiotensin–aldoste-
rone system (RAAS).7 Previously, modified bovine 
angiotensin II was shown to elicit consistent 
vasopressor effects in patients with shock.8-10 In 
a recent pilot study, addition of human angioten-
sin II to catecholamine and vasopressin therapy 
increased mean arterial pressure in patients with 
vasodilatory shock, allowing reductions in the 
dose of catecholamines.11 These findings prompt-
ed the initiation of the phase 3 Angiotensin II 
for the Treatment of High-Output Shock (ATHOS-3) 
trial to determine whether the addition of angio-
tensin II to background vasopressors would im-
prove blood pressure in patients with catechol-
amine-resistant vasodilatory shock.
Methods
Trial Design
The protocol (available with the full text of this 
article at NEJM.org) for this international, ran-
domized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial 
was designed by the protocol committee (see the 
Supplementary Appendix, available at NEJM.org) 
in collaboration with the sponsor, La Jolla Phar-
maceutical Company, and was approved by a re-
search ethics board at each participating institu-
tion.12 The study was conducted in accordance 
with Good Clinical Practice guidelines, applica-
ble local regulations, and the ethical principles 
described in the Declaration of Helsinki. The 
study was conducted under a special protocol 
assessment agreement with the U.S. Food and 
Drug Administration as a phase 3 registration 
trial13; the rationale for the trial design is dis-
cussed in the Supplementary Appendix.
Trial data were collected by the investigators 
with the assistance of a contract research orga-
nization and were analyzed by the sponsor. 
Study oversight was provided by an independent 
data and safety monitoring board. The writing 
committee, which included investigators and rep-
resentatives of the sponsor, drafted the manu-
script and vouch for the accuracy and complete-
ness of the data and analyses and for the fidelity 
of the trial to the protocol. A professional medical 
writer funded by the sponsor assisted with manu-
script revisions. All the authors made the decision 
to submit the manuscript for publication.
Patients
Eligible patients were 18 years of age or older 
and had vasodilatory shock despite intravenous 
volume resuscitation with at least 25 ml per kilo-
gram of body weight over the previous 24 hours 
and the administration of high-dose vasopres-
sors. We defined vasodilatory shock as a cardiac 
index of greater than 2.3 liters per minute per 
square meter or as central venous oxygen satura-
tion of greater than 70% coupled with central 
venous pressure of more than 8 mm Hg, with a 
mean arterial pressure between 55 and 70 mm Hg. 
We defined high-dose vasopressors as more than 
0.2 μg of norepinephrine per kilogram per min-
ute, or the equivalent dose of another vasopres-
sor (Table S1 in the Supplementary Appendix),12 
for at least 6 hours but no longer than 48 hours. 
Eligible participants also had an indwelling blad-
der catheter and arterial catheter. We excluded 
patients who had burns covering more than 20% 
of the total body-surface area, acute coronary 
syndrome, bronchospasm, liver failure, mesenteric 
ischemia, active bleeding, abdominal aortic an-
eurysm, or an absolute neutrophil count of less 
than 1000 per cubic millimeter or who were re-
ceiving venoarterial extracorporeal membrane oxy-
genation or treatment with high-dose glucocor-
ticoids. Complete inclusion and exclusion criteria 
are provided in the Supplementary Appendix.12 
Written informed consent was obtained from all 
patients or their legal surrogates.

Angiotensin II for Treatment of Vasodilatory Shock
Treatment Assignment
We assigned patients in a 1:1 ratio to receive 
synthetic human angiotensin II (LJPC-501) or 
saline placebo administered by study personnel 
at participating institutions; randomization was 
performed in blocks through a central Web-
based system. LJPC-501 and naturally occurring 
human angiotensin II have identical amino acid 
sequences. LJPC-501 is stable in refrigerated 
solution for at least 1 year at the recommended 
storage condition of 5°±3°C and is stable under 
the anticipated conditions of clinical use. Ran-
domization was stratified according to mean 
arterial pressure at screening (<65 mm Hg or 
≥65 mm Hg) and Acute Physiology and Chron-
ic Health Evaluation II (APACHE II) score (≤30, 
31 to 40, or ≥41 on a scale of 0 to 71, with 
higher scores indicating greater disease sever-
ity).14 Infusions of angiotension II and placebo 
were prepared locally in identical saline bags 
by prespecified unblinded personnel. All other 
investigators, research personnel, patients, fam-
ilies, and the sponsor were not informed of the 
treatment assignments at any time during the 
trial.
Clinical Regimen
The baseline mean arterial pressure was estab-
lished as the mean of three determinations, each in 
triplicate, that were obtained 30, 15, and 0 min-
utes before treatment. Infusions were initiated at 
a rate equivalent to 20 ng of angiotensin II per 
kilogram per minute and were adjusted during 
the first 3 hours to increase the mean arterial 
pressure to at least 75 mm Hg (Table S2 in the 
Supplementary Appendix). During this adjust-
ment period, doses of standard-of-care (back-
ground) vasopressors were held constant and 
could not be increased except for safety reasons. 
If these doses were increased, the patient was 
designated as not having had a response to the 
study intervention. The maximum rate of ad-
ministration of the study medication or placebo 
allowed during the first 3 hours was equivalent 
to a dose of 200 ng per kilogram per minute.
After 3 hours 15 minutes, the study drug or 
placebo and other vasopressors were adjusted 
to maintain a target mean arterial pressure 
between 65 and 75 mm Hg. Between 3 hours 
15 minutes and 48 hours, angiotensin II or pla-
cebo could be adjusted to an infusion rate in 
milliliters per hour that was equivalent to a dose 
of 1.25 to 40 ng per kilogram per minute in 
patients assigned to angiotensin II. The protocol 
included a nonbinding adjustment scheme (Ta-
ble S3 in the Supplementary Appendix).
At hour 48, the study infusion was discon-
tinued according to a protocol-specified taper-
ing process. If the background vasopressor 
dose was subsequently increased to more than 
0.1 μg of norepinephrine per kilogram per min-
ute or the equivalent, or if the patient’s condition 
became unstable, study medication or placebo 
could be resumed for up to 7 days. However, 
once the study medication or placebo was dis-
continued for more than 3 hours, it could not be 
restarted.
Assessments and End Points
The primary end point was the response with 
respect to mean arterial pressure at hour 3, with 
response defined as a mean arterial pressure of 
75 mm Hg or higher or an increase in mean arte-
rial pressure from baseline of at least 10 mm Hg, 
without an increase in the dose of background 
vasopressors. The mean values of triplicate deter-
minations of mean arterial pressure at 2 hours 
45 minutes, 3 hours, and 3 hours 15 minutes 
after initiation of angiotensin II or placebo were 
computed to assess the primary end point. Hier-
archically ordered secondary efficacy end points 
were changes in the cardiovascular Sequential 
Organ Failure Assessment (SOFA) score (scores 
range from 0 to 4, with higher scores indicating 
more severe organ dysfunction) and the total 
SOFA score (scores range from 0 to 20, with 
higher scores indicating more severe organ dys-
function) between baseline measurement and 
hour 48 (Table S4 in the Supplementary Appen-
dix).15 Safety was evaluated by assessment of 
serious adverse events, adverse event–related drug 
discontinuations, all adverse events, and all-cause 
mortality at 7 days and 28 days.
Statistical Analyses
We based the sample size on a hypothesized rate 
of achievement of the primary efficacy end point 
of 40% in the placebo group and 60% in the 
angiotensin II group. We determined that a 
sample size of 150 patients per treatment group 
would provide more than 90% power to show 
the superiority of angiotensin II over placebo, 
using a two-by-two chi-square test at a two-sided 
alpha level of 0.05. One interim analysis was

The new engl and jour nal of medicine
performed, with data available only to the data 
and safety monitoring board, after 150 patients 
had completed the day 28 assessment. On the 
basis of this analysis, the data and safety moni-
toring board recommended that the trial con-
tinue as planned.
Safety analyses included all patients who re-
ceived treatment. The primary efficacy analysis 
was based on the modified intention-to-treat 
population, which included all patients who un-
derwent randomization and began to receive 
angiotensin II or placebo. Patients with missing 
data owing to death were considered in the as-
sessment of efficacy end points as having treat-
ment failure. Values missing for reasons other 
than death were imputed as the last observed value 
carried forward in modified intention-to-treat 
analyses; no imputations for missing data were 
performed in safety analyses.
Data were analyzed with the use of SAS soft-
ware, version 9.4. We used descriptive statistics 
with 95% confidence intervals to summarize data 
according to treatment group. We analyzed dif-
ferences between treatment groups using the 
Wilcoxon rank-sum test or analysis of variance 
for continuous or ordinal variables and the chi-
square or Fisher’s exact test for discrete vari-
ables. We used a two-tailed alpha level of 0.05 to 
test the hypothesis of treatment difference. Hier-
archical testing assessed, in order, the response 
with respect to mean arterial pressure at hour 3, 
the change in cardiovascular SOFA score at hour 
48, and the change in total SOFA score at hour 48.
We analyzed the primary end point using 
logistic regression with adjustment for dichoto-
mized baseline mean arterial pressure, APACHE 
II score, vasopressin use in the 6 hours before 
randomization, and vasopressor dose, in nor-
epinephrine equivalents, during the 6 hours be-
fore randomization. In addition, we used logistic-
regression analysis to identify baseline factors 
that may have influenced the primary end point 
(Table S5 in the Supplementary Appendix). We 
conducted sensitivity analyses of the primary 
end point, including an unadjusted analysis with 
the use of a chi-square test and an analysis 
with stratification according to randomization 
variables. Time-to-event data including mortal-
ity were compared by a log-rank test and were 
characterized by Kaplan–Meier estimates. Haz-
ard rates were estimated from the proportional-
hazards model.
Results
Patients
This trial was conducted from May 2015 through 
January 2017 in 75 intensive care units across 
nine countries in North America, Australasia, 
and Europe (Table S6 in the Supplementary Ap-
pendix). Of 404 patients who were screened, 344 
were enrolled and randomly assigned to a study 
group (Fig. 1). A total of 23 of the 344 patients 
who underwent randomization did not receive 
angiotensin II or placebo; the most common rea-
sons were rapid improvement of condition (10 pa-
tients), withdrawal of consent (4), rapid decline 
of condition (4), and physician decision (3). Thus, 
the study regimen was initiated in 321 patients, 
of whom 163 patients received angiotensin II 
and 158 received placebo. The study groups were 
well matched with respect to baseline disease 
characteristics and demographics (Table 1, and 
Table S7 in the Supplementary Appendix). The 
patients in the two study groups were severely 
ill, as indicated by high APACHE II scores and 
elevated baseline vasopressor doses. Sepsis was 
the cause of shock in 259 of the 321 patients 
(80.7%).
Efficacy Outcomes
All trial participants in the modified intention-
to-treat population had data available for the 
primary end point, and no imputation was re-
quired. Significantly more patients in the angio-
tensin II group than in the placebo group met the 
criteria for the primary end point of response 
with respect to mean arterial pressure at hour 3 
(69.9% vs. 23.4%, P<0.001; odds ratio, 7.95; 95% 
confidence interval [CI], 4.76 to 13.3) (Table 2). 
The most common reason in both groups for lack 
of response was failure to achieve a mean arte-
rial pressure of at least 75 mm Hg or an increase 
of at least 10 mm Hg (the other reason was an 
increase in the dose of background vasopres-
sors). During the first 3 hours, the angiotensin II 
group had a significantly greater increase in 
mean arterial pressure than the placebo group 
(12.5 mm Hg vs. 2.9 mm Hg; P<0.001) (Fig. 2A). 
In the angiotensin II group, the mean arterial 
pressure increased rapidly, allowing the angio-
tensin II dose to be decreased from the original 
20 ng per kilogram per minute in 67% of the 
patients within 30 minutes and permitting de-
creases in doses of concomitant vasopressors.

Angiotensin II for Treatment of Vasodilatory Shock
Figure 1. Screening, Randomization, and Follow-up.
Patient disposition from screening through day 28 is shown. Efficacy and safety analyses are based on the modified 
intention-to-treat population (all patients who underwent randomization and began to receive angiotensin II or pla-
cebo). The patient identified as undergoing rerandomization was initially assigned to the placebo group and had to 
be withdrawn from the study before the first dose was administered because the patient underwent an operative 
procedure. This patient subsequently underwent rerandomization to the angiotensin II group. In accordance with 
the preapproved statistical analysis plan, this patient was included in the angiotensin II group for the modified in-
tention-to-treat (mITT) and safety analyses and in the placebo group for the intention-to-treat analyses. The end of 
study was day 7 or 3 days after the last administration of angiotensin II or placebo, whichever occurred later. Of the 
119 patients in the angiotensin II group who completed the end of study, 3 died by day 7 but after the end-of-study 
assessment. The number of patients who completed follow-up to day 28 includes 2 patients who were discharged 
before the end-of-study visit but later completed follow-up to day 28.

Angiotensin II for Treatment of Vasodilatory Shock
During the first 48 hours, mean doses of back-
ground vasopressors were consistently less in 
the angiotensin II group than in the placebo 
group (Fig. 2B). Absolute heart rates were higher 
in the angiotensin II group. (Additional details 
can be found in Figs. S1 through S3 and Tables 
S8 through S10 in the Supplementary Appendix.)
At 48 hours, improvement (indicated by lower 
scores) in the cardiovascular SOFA score was 
significantly greater in the angiotensin II group 
than in the placebo group (−1.75 vs. −1.28, 
P 
= 
0.01). There were no significant differences in 
other SOFA score components. At 48 hours, the 
total SOFA score increased to a similar degree in 
the two groups (1.05 and 1.04, respectively; 
P 
= 
0.49). Efficacy was also evaluated in the inten-
tion-to-treat population, and the outcomes were 
similar to those in the modified intention-to-treat 
population. (For additional details, see Tables S11 
and S12 in the Supplementary Appendix.)
In multivariate analysis, after adjustment for 
age, sex, and prespecified stratification variables, 
treatment assignment (angiotensin II vs. placebo) 
was the most significant positive predictor of a 
response with respect to mean arterial pressure 
(odds ratio, 12.4; 95% CI, 6.7 to 22.8; P<0.001) 
(Table S5 in the Supplementary Appendix). Sig-
nificant negative predictors were hypoalbumin-
emia (odds ratio, 0.40; 95% CI, 0.22 to 0.72; 
P 
= 
0.002) and elevated vasopressor dose (odds 
ratio, 0.40; 95% CI, 0.21 to 0.77; P 
= 
0.006). A re-
sponse with respect to mean arterial pressure was 
achieved by a greater proportion of patients in the 
angiotensin II group who were receiving norepi-
nephrine-equivalent doses of less than 0.5 μg per 
kilogram per minute at baseline than patients who 
were receiving higher doses (91 of 117 patients 
[77.8%] vs. 23 of 46 patients [50.0%], P<0.001).
Safety
Adverse events of any grade were reported in 
87.1% of the patients who received angiotensin II 
and in 91.8% of the patients who received placebo 
(Table 3, and Table S13 in the Supplementary Ap-
pendix). Infusion of angiotensin II or placebo was 
discontinued because of adverse events in 14.1% 
of the patients who received angiotensin II and in 
21.5% of those who received placebo. The most 
common adverse events leading to discontinu-
ation were similar in the two treatment groups 
and included septic shock, multiorgan failure, 
cardiogenic shock, and cardiac arrest (Table S14 in 
the Supplementary Appendix). Serious adverse 
events were reported in 60.7% of the patients who 
received angiotensin II and in 67.1% of the patients 
who received placebo (Table 3).

The new engl and jour nal of medicine
The rates of adverse events of special interest 
were similar in the angiotensin II and placebo 
groups. Specifically, rates of tachyarrhythmias, 
distal ischemia, ventricular tachycardia, and atrial 
fibrillation were similar in the two groups (Table 
S15 in the Supplementary Appendix). No patient 
died during the initial period of adjustment of 
the dose of angiotensin II or placebo. Death from 
any cause by day 7 occurred in 47 of 163 patients 
(28.8%) who received angiotensin II and in 55 of 
158 patients (34.8%) who received placebo (haz-
ard ratio, 0.78; 95% CI, 0.53 to 1.16; P 
= 
0.22) 
(Table 2). Death by day 28 occurred in 75 of 163 
(46.0%) and 85 of 158 (53.8%) of patients in the 
angiotensin II and placebo groups, respectively 
(hazard ratio, 0.78; 95% CI, 0.57 to 1.07; P 
= 
0.12); 
results were similar after adjustment for age and 
sex (Fig. S4 in the Supplementary Appendix).
Discussion
In this multinational, double-blind, randomized, 
controlled trial involving patients with vasodila-
tory shock who were receiving high doses of con-
ventional vasopressors, the percentage of patients 
who met the primary end point with respect to 
mean arterial pressure at 3 hours was signifi-
cantly greater in the angiotensin II group than 
in the placebo group. Patients who received angio-
tensin II also had lower requirements for cate-
cholamines than patients who received placebo. 
In a finding consistent with this result, cardiovas-
cular SOFA scores, which quantify catecholamine 
use, were significantly lower in the angiotensin 
group than in the placebo group at 48 hours.
The marked vasopressor effects of angioten-
sin were noted soon after its first isolation in the 
late 1930s,16,17 and case reports have described 
the successful use of various bovine and human 
angiotensin II formulations as rescue therapy for 
patients with refractory shock.18-20 The potential 
usefulness of angiotensin II as a vasopressor is 
also supported by a small pilot study.11 In our 
larger trial, we evaluated a formulation of angio-
tensin II that is sufficiently stable for widespread 
clinical use.
Treatment options for patients with catechola-
mine-resistant vasodilatory shock are limited, and 
the treatments that are available are often asso-
ciated with side effects. Specific options include

Angiotensin II for Treatment of Vasodilatory Shock
Figure 2. Treatment Responses.
Efficacy outcomes are shown according to study group. Panel A shows the mean arterial pressure from initiation of 
angiotensin II or placebo through 48 hours. The gray shading indicates the initial 3 hours during which the goal was 
to increase the mean arterial pressure to 75 mm Hg or higher; thereafter, the target mean arterial pressure was de-
termined by the treating team. Panel B shows the changes from baseline in mean doses of vasopressors, denoted in 
norepinephrine-equivalents, from initiation of angiotensin II or placebo through 48 hours. In both panels, I bars in-
dicate standard errors. At each time point, the number at risk and the mean value include only patients who were 
receiving at least one vasopressor.

Angiotensin II for Treatment of Vasodilatory Shock
glucocorticoids, vasopressin, methylene blue, and 
high-volume hemofiltration, all of which are used 
as adjunct therapies to maintain blood pressure 
in patients with vasodilatory shock.21 Previously, 
new therapies proved to be disappointing. Nota-
bly, the nitric oxide synthase inhibitor 546C88 
increased blood pressure in patients with septic 
shock but was associated with more frequent 
cardiovascular side effects and increased 28-day 
mortality.22 In contrast, in our study, angioten-
sin II was not associated with higher mortality 
or a greater frequency of cardiovascular and other 
adverse events than was placebo.
The rationale for our study was based, in part, 
on the potential benefits of more closely mim-
icking natural physiologic responses to shock, 
which include increased secretion of catechol-
amines, vasopressin, and RAAS hormones. Pre-
clinical and clinical data have shown that these 
vasoactive substances are synergistic,23,24 and 
multimodal therapy may leverage this synergy to 
allow lower doses with potentially fewer toxic 
effects. The observed increases in mean arterial 
pressure with angiotensin II, with concomitant 
reductions in catecholamine requirements, sup-
port this view.
Our study has certain limitations. First, the 
significant blood-pressure response to angioten-
sin II, which permitted rapid reduction of cate-
cholamine doses in some patients, may have 
allowed treating clinicians to correctly guess the 
treatment assignment in some cases. However, 
one in four placebo recipients showed a response 
in mean arterial pressure. Second, our study had 
a relatively small sample size, so the possibility 
of clinically important side effects attributable 
to angiotensin II therapy cannot be excluded. 
Third, because our trial was not powered to de-
tect mortality effects, the confidence intervals 
around mortality point estimates are wide. Finally, 
because follow-up was limited to 28 days, the 
possibility of either beneficial or harmful long-
term effects of angiotensin II therapy cannot be 
excluded. Larger trials with longer duration of 
follow-up are warranted to address these ques-
tions, as are direct comparisons of angiotensin 
II with other vasopressors.
In conclusion, angiotensin II administered 
intravenously increased blood pressure and al-
lowed catecholamine dose reductions in patients 
with vasodilatory shock who were receiving high-
dose vasopressors.
