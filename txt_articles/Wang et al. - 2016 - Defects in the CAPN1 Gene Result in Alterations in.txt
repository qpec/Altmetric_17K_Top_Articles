SUMMARY
A CAPN1 missense mutation in Parson Russell
Terrier dogs is associated with spinocerebellar
ataxia. We now report that homozygous or heterozy-
gous CAPN1-null mutations in humans result in
cerebellar ataxia and limb spasticity in four indepen-
dent pedigrees. Calpain-1 knockout (KO) mice also
exhibit a mild form of ataxia due to abnormal cere-
bellar development, including enhanced neuronal
apoptosis, decreased number of cerebellar granule
cells, and altered synaptic transmission. Enhanced
apoptosis is due to absence of calpain-1-mediated
cleavage of PH domain and leucine-rich repeat pro-
tein phosphatase 1 (PHLPP1), which results in inhibi-
tion of the Akt pro-survival pathway in developing
granule cells. Injection of neonatal mice with the indi-
rect Akt activator, bisperoxovanadium, or crossing
calpain-1 KO mice with PHLPP1 KO mice prevented
increased postnatal cerebellar granule cell apoptosis
and restored granule cell density and motor coordi-
nation in adult mice. Thus, mutations in CAPN1 are
an additional cause of ataxia in mammals, including
humans.
INTRODUCTION
Calpains are calcium-dependent proteases playing both physio-
logical and pathological roles in the CNS (Liu et al., 2008; Wang
et al., 2013; Wang et al., 2014). Two major calpain isoforms
are present in CNS, calpain-1 and calpain-2, which differ in their
calcium requirements for activation. Calpain activity is higher
in cerebellum than in cortex or hippocampus across different
mammalian species (Baudry et al., 1986). Immunohistochem-
istry study revealed that the major calpain isoform expressed
in cerebellar neurons is calpain-1 (Hamakubo et al., 1986).
Calpain-1 activity in cerebellum during prenatal and early post-
natal period is high, as compared to that in adulthood (Simonson
et al., 1985), suggesting a potential role for calpain-1 in cerebellar
development. Interestingly, a CAPN1 missense mutation in the
Parson Russell Terrier dog breed has been associated with spi-
nocerebellar ataxia (Forman et al., 2013).
Loss of cerebellar granule cells (CGCs) induced by different
mechanisms results in ataxia (Hashimoto et al., 1999; Kim
et al., 2009; Pennacchio et al., 1998; Shmerling et al., 1998).
NMDA receptor (NMDAR) activity is essential for CGC survival
during the critical stage of cerebellar development (Bala
´ zs
et al., 1988; Monti and Contestabile, 2000; Monti et al., 2002;
Moran and Patel, 1989), although the underlying mechanism
remains elusive. NMDAR-induced activation of the nuclear factor
CREB is required (Monti et al., 2002), and CREB is a target of the
pro-survival kinase Akt (Du and Montminy, 1998).
Synaptic NMDAR-mediated calpain-1 activation results in
the degradation of the PH domain and leucine-rich repeat pro-
tein phosphatase 1 (PHLPP1). PHLPP1 dephosphorylates and
inhibits Akt and is involved in tumorigenesis (Chen et al., 2011),
circadian clock (Masubuchi et al., 2010), learning and memory
process (Shimizu et al., 2007; Wang et al., 2014), and autophagy
(Arias et al., 2015). Calpain-1-mediated degradation of PHLPP1
activates Akt and promotes neuronal survival (Wang et al., 2013),

 and we postulated
that calpain-1-mediated
regulation
of
PHLPP1 and Akt could be involved in NMDAR-dependent
CGC survival during postnatal development.
Here, we report that calpain-1 KO mice exhibit abnormal
cerebellar
development,
including
enhanced
apoptosis
of
CGCs during the early postnatal period, reduced granule cell
density and impaired synaptic transmission from parallel fiber
to Purkinje cells, resulting in an ataxia phenotype. All these de-
fects are due to deficits in the calpain-1/PHLPP1/Akt pro-sur-
vival pathway in developing granule cells, since treatment with
an Akt activator during the postnatal period or crossing cal-
pain-1 KO mice with PHLPP1 KO mice restores most of the
observed alterations in cerebellar structure and function in
calpain-1 KO mice. We also report four human families carrying
homozygous or heterozygous compound CAPN1 mutations
segregating with cerebellar ataxia. These findings indicate that
CAPN1 is an additional gene for cerebellar ataxia.
RESULTS
Four Human Pedigrees of Spastic Ataxia with Calpain-1-
Null Mutations
Blood samples and DNA were extracted from affected and
unaffected family members with informed consent (institutional
review board/ethics 06/N076). The index patient in family R (Fig-
ure 1A) is currently 43 years old and of Bangladeshi origin, living
in the UK. The proband first presented with gait ataxia, spasticity,
and dysphagia in her late teens with slow symptom progression
over the subsequent years. She is now a wheelchair user with
severe ataxia and cerebellar and bulbar dysarthria, and she falls
and exhibits spasticity. There is mild cognitive decline on clin-
ical and standard psychometric IQ testing. MRI investigations
showed mild cerebellar atrophy (Figure 1B). Electromyography
and nerve conduction studies were normal. Standard screening
prior to mapping and exome sequencing included negative
testing for SCA1, 2, 3, 6, 7, 8, 11, 12, 14, 17, FRDA, AOA1,
AOA2, ATM, and common mitochondrial mutations.
Homozygosity mapping across the genome was carried out
using DNA SNP arrays (Illumina) and identified shared regions

 of homozygosity with a number of variants between the two
affected individuals in family R. Exome sequencing was carried
out to a depth of 503 coverage, and variants were filtered ac-
cording to a number of parameters, including the homozygous
regions in both affected individuals. They shared a homozygous
splice mutation in CAPN1 (exon3:c.337+1G > A), predicted to
interfere with normal RNA splicing.
cDNA was synthesized from RNA extracted from a peripheral
blood sample from the index patient in family R. Primers de-
signed to amplify across the splice site were used to show
that the variant results in retention of part of the intron produc-
ing an in-frame insertion of nine amino acids (Figure 1C). Ho-
mology modeling of the mutant protein was performed using
SwissModel and was based on the established crystal structure
for calpain-1. The nine-amino-acid insertion was located close to
the active site and visualization of the mutant protein structure
shows that the additional peptide loop would sterically block
the active site cleft (Figure 1D). Besides the two patients in family
R mentioned above, we found CAPN1 mutations in three addi-
tional pedigrees. One Italian patient (SAL-584-005) harbored a
NM_001198868:c.183dupC
homozygous
frameshift
variant,
two Tunisian siblings (Tun66273 and Tun66275) presented with
a NM_001198868:c.1534C > T homozygous missense muta-
tion, and one proband from French and Spanish ascent (SAL-
399-073) carried a NM_001198868:c.C463T nonsense variant
(Q155X) in trans with a NM_001198868:c.C1142T missense
change. Reported missense mutations are respectively respon-
sible for arginine 512 to cysteine (R512C) and alanine 381 to
valine (A381V) substitutions in calpain-1, which may both disrupt
the protein function. All these families have similar clinical pre-
sentations with progressive spastic ataxia, associated with
mild axonal peripheral involvement and slow ocular saccades
in one family. We further describe them in the Supplemental In-
formation (Figures S1–S3).
Fibroblasts were isolated from the skin biopsy of the index pa-
tient in family R and two control humans. Levels of calpain-1, cal-
pain-2, PHLPP1, and Akt in fibroblast lysates were examined
with western blot (Figures 1E and 1F). Surprisingly, calpain-1
expression was completely absent in patient fibroblasts. There
was a faint band slightly higher than the normal calpain-1 band
found in control fibroblasts (Figure 1E, calpain-1 high exposure),
which is possibly the mutated calpain-1 with the nine-amino-
acid insert. These results suggest that the mutated calpain-1
protein is unstable and rapidly degraded after synthesis.
Calpain-2 level was normal in the patient cell line, as compared
to two control cell lines. The level of PHLPP1, a specific sub-
strate of calpain-1 (Wang et al., 2013), was slightly but not signif-
icantly increased, and the level of phospho-Akt Ser473 (pAkt),
which can be dephosphorylated by PHLPP1, was significantly
decreased in patient fibroblasts, as compared to control fibro-
blasts. Calpain activity in fibroblast lysates was measured with
a fluorescent substrate, Suc-Leu-Tyr-AMC (Figure 1G), in the
presence of 20 mM or 2 mM free Ca2+, respectively. While
calpain-1 activity was present in control cell lines, it was absent
in the patient cell line. Calpain-2 activity was present in all cell
lines. A calpain-2 selective inhibitor (C2I) Z-Leu-Abu-CONH-
CH2-C6H3 (3, 5-(OMe)2) (Wang et al., 2014) was used to confirm
the absence of calpain-1 in the patient cell line.
Calpain-1 KO Mice Exhibit Ataxia
To test whether lack of calpain-1 could result in ataxia in mice,
motor performance of calpain-1 KO and wild-type (WT) mice
was evaluated by rotarod and gait tests. Calpain-1 KO mice
exhibited a slight but not significant reduced latency to fall
from a rotating rod at 3 months of age (Figure 2A). At 7 months
of age, KO mice exhibited a significantly shorter latency to fall
from trial days 3 to 7, as compared to age-matched WT mice
(Figure 2B). Calpain-1 KO mice also had shorter strides and
stances and longer sways at all tested ages (3, 5, 6, and
7 months), as compared to WT mice (Figures 2C–2E).
Calpain-1 KO Mice Exhibit Enhanced Apoptosis of CGCs
during Postnatal Development and Reduced CGC
Density in Adulthood
Blockade of NMDAR during postnatal development exacer-
bates the normal apoptotic elimination of CGCs in rats (Monti
and Contestabile, 2000). We first repeated this result with multi-
ple intraperitoneal (i.p.) injections of the NMDAR antagonist
MK801 (0.5 mg/kg) before postnatal days (PNDs) 3, 7, or 10 in
WT mice. After three injections at 24, 16, and 8 hr before
PND 3, 7, or 10, enhanced apoptosis was evident in the external
and internal granular layer of cerebellum in MK801-injected mice
at PND7 (Figures 3A and 3C) and 10 (Figures 3B and 3C) but not
PND3 (Figure 3C), a result consistent with the findings in rats.
To determine whether calpain-1 was involved in NMDAR-medi-
ated survival in developing cerebellum, we analyzed neuronal
apoptosis in cerebellum of calpain-1 KO mice at PND3, 7, and
10. Enhanced apoptosis was found in the cerebellar granular
layer of calpain-1 KO mice at PND7 (Figures 3A and 3C) and
10 (Figures 3B and 3C) but not 3 (Figure 3C), as compared
to age-matched WT mice. Both the temporal and spatial pat-
terns of neuronal apoptosis in calpain-1 KO mice were similar
to those found in MK801-injected mice, suggesting that cal-
pain-1 and NMDAR activate the same pro-survival pathway in
developing CGCs. We determined the long-term consequences
of enhanced CGC apoptosis in developing cerebellum by
measuring CGC density in 3-month-old calpain-1 KO mice and
WT mice. Calpain-1 KO mice had a small but significant reduc-
tion in CGC density, as compared to WT mice (Figure 3D).
In addition, we found enhanced apoptosis in multiple brain
regions of calpain-1 KO mice at PND3 and 7 but not PND10,
as compared to WT mice at the same ages (Figures S4A and
S4B; Table S1), suggesting that calpain-1 activity also supports
neuronal survival in multiple brain regions during postnatal
development. NMDARs are transiently expressed and their
activation also supports neuronal survival in the developing
spinal cord (Brenneman et al., 1990; Kalb et al., 1992). However,
we did not find increased apoptosis in the cervical or lumbar
enlargement of spinal cord in MK801-injected mice or calpain-
1 KO mice at PND7 (Figures S4C and S4D).

morphology (Figure S5A) and normal dendritic branching pattern

tions of 3-month-old WT and calpain-1 KO mice indicated that

 spine density was comparable between WT and KO mice, but
spine morphology was significantly different (Figures 3E–3G).
Purkinje cells in KO mice had more thin or filopodia-like
spines and less mushroom or stubby spines, as compared to
WT mice, indicating that there is a higher proportion of immature
spines in Purkinje cells of adult calpain-1 KO mice, as compared
to WT mice.
The reduced CGC density and abnormal dendritic spine
morphology of Purkinje cells led us to examine parallel fiber to
Purkinje cell (PF-PC) synapses in KO mice. We first performed
double immunostaining with a PF-specific presynaptic marker,
VGluT1, and a postsynaptic marker, GluR2, in cerebellar sec-
tions of 3-month-old WT and calpain-1 KO mice (left and middle
panel of Figure 4A). Both GluR2 and VGluT1 exhibited a puncta
distribution in the molecular layer and the numbers of GluR2
and VGluT1 puncta were significantly reduced in the molecular
layer of calpain-1 KO mice, as compared to WT mice (Figures
4B and 4C). The number of double-stained puncta, which corre-
spond to PF-PC synapses, was also significantly reduced in KO
mice (Figure 4D). While GluR2 and PSD95 levels in whole ho-
mogenates were comparable between WT and KO mice, they
were significantly reduced in PSD fractions from KO mice (Fig-
ures 4E and 4F).
We recorded excitatory postsynaptic potentials (EPSPs) eli-
cited in the Purkinje cell body layer by electrical stimulation of
the parallel fibers at various stimulation intensities. This stimu-
lation elicited a typical P1-N1-P2-N2 waveform (Barnes et al.,
2011), where N1 corresponds to the presynaptic fiber volley
and N2 to the postsynaptic population spike (Figure 4G). Re-
sponses elicited by stimulation intensity below 120 mA were
too unreliable to be analyzed and only responses elicited by
stimulation intensities above 120 mA were analyzed by calcu-
lating the ratio of N2 over N1, which reflects the efficiency of syn-
aptic transmission. At all intensities, the N2/N1 ratio was smaller
in KO as compared to WT mice and the overall difference be-
tween the two genotypes was statistically significant (Figure 4G).
Climbing fiber to Purkinje cell (CF-PC) synapses were double
immunostained with a CF-specific presynaptic marker, VGluT2,
and a Purkinje dendritic marker, calbindin, in cerebellar sections
of WT and calpain-1 KO mice (Figure 4H). The densities of
VGluT2 puncta were comparable between WT and KO mice (Fig-
ure 4I), suggesting that the CF-PC synapses were normal in
calpain-1 KO mice.
Calpain-1-Dependent PHLPP1 Degradation and Akt
Activation Are Deficient in Developing Cerebellum of
Calpain-1 KO Mice
Calpain-1-mediated pro-survival pathway involves calpain-1
cleavage of PHLPP1 and subsequent Akt activation (Wang
et al., 2013). Basal levels of PHLPP1, pAkt, and total Akt were

lower at PND7 as compared toPND3 and
adult, reflecting the increase in calpain-1
activity during this postnatal period. The
decrease in PHLPP1 levels was not
observed in calpain-1 KO mice at PND7
(P7 WT versus P7 KO, Figure 5B). Re-
flecting the higher levels of PHLPP1 in cal-
pain-1 KO mice, levels of pAkt were lower
in cerebellum of calpain-1 KO mice at
all tested time points, including adult,
as compared to age-matched WT mice
(Figures 5A and 5B). Cerebellar sections
from WT and KO mice at PND7 were
double immunostained with pAkt and
NeuroD1, a CGC marker. Immunoreac-
tivity for pAkt was significantly lower in the external granular layer
(EGL) of KO mice (Figures 5C and 5D).
Acute cerebellar slices of PND7 WT mice were treated with
NMDA (10 mM) for 20 min. PHLPP1 levels were significantly
decreased and pAkt levels increased after NMDA treatment.

 Pretreatment with MK801 (50 mM) or calpain inhibitor III (10 mM)
10 min before NMDA treatment completely blocked NMDA-
induced changes in PHLPP1 and pAkt (Figures 5E and 5F), but
pretreatment with a selective calpain-2 inhibitor had no effect
(Figures 5E and 5F), suggesting that calpain-2 activation was
not involved. Moreover, NMDA-induced degradation of PHLPP1
and pAkt increase were absent in cerebellar slices of calpain-1
KO mice at PND7 (Figures 5G–5I), indicating that calpain-1 is
required for NMDAR-mediated regulation of Akt in developing
cerebellum.
Cerebellar Granule Cell Loss and Motor Deficits in
Calpain-1 KO Mice Are Reversed by Activating Akt
during the Critical Period of Development
To reverse reduced pAkt levels in cerebellum of calpain-1 KO
mice during the early postnatal period, we treated calpain-1
KO mice from PND1 to PND7 with a PTEN inhibitor, bisperoxo-
vanadium (bpV) (0.5 mg/kg, ip, twice daily), which has been
shown to activate Akt (Boda et al., 2014; Li et al., 2009; Mao
et al., 2013). BpV injection significantly increased pAkt levels in
cerebellum of developing KO mice, as shown by both immuno-
blotting (Figures S6A and S6B) and immunostaining (Figures
5C and 5D), and completely prevented enhanced apoptosis in
cerebellum (Figures 3A and 3C) and cerebrum (Table S1) of
calpain-1 KO mice at PND7. Three months after bpV injection
in KO mice, pAkt levels in cerebellum were reduced to the
same levels as those found in control KO mice (Figures S6C
and S6D), indicating that the effect of bpV on Akt was transient.
However, the decrease in CGC density observed in 3-month-old
KO mice was reversed by postnatal bpV injection (Figure 3D).
Furthermore, the deficit in the rotarod test in 7-month-old
KO mice was also completely reversed (Figure 2B), and the
abnormal gait at different ages was partially or totally corrected
(Figures 2C–2E) by postnatal bpV treatment. The above results
indicate that reduced pAkt levels in developing cerebellum are
responsible for the CGC loss and motor deficits observed in
adult calpain-1 KO mice.
Calpain-1/PHLPP1 Double-Knockout Mice Have Normal
CGC Density, PF-PC Transmission, and Motor
Performance
To determine whether calpain-1 cleavage of PHLPP1 was
essential for CGC survival, we generated double-KO mice,
lacking both calpain-1 and PHLPP1 (DKO), as PHLPP1 KO
should mimic calpain-1 cleavage of PHLPP1 and reverse the
deficits caused by calpain-1 KO. Levels of pAkt were increased
in cerebellar homogenates of DKO mice at PND7, as compared
to calpain-1 KO mice (Figures 6A and 6B). The number of
apoptotic neurons in cerebellum of PND7 DKO mice was signif-
icantly reduced and was comparable to that in control WT and
PHLPP1 KO mice (Figures 6C and 6D). Consequently, CGC den-
sity in 3-month-old DKO mice was significantly increased, as
compared to calpain-1 KO mice, and was similar to the value
found in WT mice (Figures 6E and 6F).
The numbers of GluR2 puncta, VGluT1 puncta, and double-
stained puncta in the molecular layer of 3-month-old DKO
mice were significantly increased as compared to calpain-1
KO mice and were comparable to those of WT mice (Figures
4A–4D). Similarly, levels of GluR2 and PSD95 in the PSD fraction
of DKO mice were significantly increased (Figures 4E and 4F). In
addition, the N2/N1 ratios of the EPSPs recorded in cerebellar
slices from DKO at all stimulation intensities were intermediate
between those in WT and KO mice, indicating that synaptic
transmission was at least partially restored in cerebellum of
DKO mice (Figure 4G).
Finally, impaired rotarod performance and abnormal gait in
calpain-1 KO mice were corrected in DKO mice. Calpain-1 KO
mice with mixed background exhibited a significantly shorter
latency to fall at trial days 6 and 7, as compared to age-matched
WT mice. However, in DKO mice the latency to fall was signifi-
cantly improved at trial days 6 and 7, as compared to calpain-1
KO mice (Figure 6G). The DKO mice also exhibited significantly
longer strides and stances and shorter sways at 3, 4, and
5 months of age, as compared to calpain-1 KO mice with
the same background (Figures 6H–6J). As a control, PHLPP1
KO mice exhibited normal rotarod performance and gaits, as
compared to WT mice (Figures 6G–6J).
DISCUSSION
Our results indicate that null mutations or downregulation
of calpain-1 leads to cerebellar ataxia in both humans and
mice. Calpain-1 downregulation results in increased cerebellar
PHLPP1 levels, which inhibit Akt and cause cerebellar granule
cell death during a critical period of postnatal cerebellar develop-
ment, and reduced granule cell density in adult KO mice. It also
results in impaired spine morphology of Purkinje cells, with an
increased proportion of immature spines, a decreased number
of parallel fibers to Purkinje synapses and a decreased efficiency
of synaptic transmission at these synapses. All these abnormal-
ities are likely to contribute to the ataxia phenotype observed in
mouse and humans. These abnormalities are reversed by either
activating Akt during the critical period of cerebellar develop-
ment (bpV treatment from P1 to P7), or downregulating PHLPP1,
underscoring the critical role of calpain-1-mediated PHLPP1
truncation and Akt activation in postnatal development. Despite
the fact that in the double knockout the deletions are systemic,
all evidence indicates that the interactions take place within
CGCs because both calpain-1 (Amadoro et al., 2007) and
PHLPP1
(http://mouse.brain-map.org/gene/show/62602)
are
expressed in CGCs.
CAPN1 Is an Additional Gene for Spastic Ataxia
Cysteine 115 to tyrosine (C115Y) mutation of calpain-1 in the
Parson Russell Terrier dog breed was associated with spino-
cerebellar ataxia (Forman et al., 2013). Cysteine 115 is in the
catalytic site of calpain-1, and its mutation in recombinant
human calpain-1 completely eliminated calpain-1 activity (Hata
et al., 2013), indicating that the C115Y mutation in dog is a
calpain-1-null mutation. In humans, we identified three consan-
guineous families that were homozygous in affected individuals
around the CAPN1 region and exome sequencing identified
mutations in the CAPN1 gene, and one recessive family with
CAPN1 compound heterozygous mutations. In one family, west-
ern blot and calpain assay in fibroblasts from the affected pa-
tient showed that calpain-1 expression and activity was absent,
86
Cell Reports 16, 79–91, June 28, 2016
 indicating that this ataxia patient is a calpain-1 KO human. A sec-
ond family harbored a homozygous frameshift variant, and the
mutations in the other two families are predicted to produce
functional inactivation of calpain-1. Thus, calpain-1 KO mice
provide a rational model to study the mechanism underlying

ataxia in dogs and humans. While cal-
pain-1
KO
mice
exhibited
an
ataxia
phenotype, which became more pro-
nounced with age, as shown by rotarod
and gait tests, the phenotype was not as
severe as that observed in dogs and hu-
mans with calpain-1 mutations. While
this raises the possibility that the alter-
ations found in KO mice could explain
only part of the basis for the ataxia in
humans (and possibly dogs), it is not
uncommon that mutation-related pheno-
types in mice are less severe than those
observed in humans, as in Atm-deficient
mice (Barlow et al., 1996), which could
reflect differences in temporal and spatial rates of development
between mice and humans. It is nevertheless logical to assume
that all the abnormalities found in KO mice contribute to the
observed motor deficits in calpain-1 KO mice, as motor function
was restored in bpV-injected KO mice and in DKO mice.
Cell Reports 16, 79–91, June 28, 2016

 Increased calpain activity can also lead to ataxic phenotype.
Thus, mutation in bIII spectrin in both human and mouse caused
increased calpain proteolysis of aII spectrin, which results in
ataxic and seizure phenotypes (Stankewich et al., 2010). In
addition, enhanced calpain activity aggravated pathogenesis
of spinocerebellar ataxia type 3 (SCA3) (H€
ubener et al., 2013).
Together with our findings, those studies suggest that unbal-
anced calpain activity, either too little or too much, can result
in cerebellar dysfunction and ataxia.
The NMDAR/Calpain-1/PHLLP1/Akt Pro-survival
Pathway Limits the Extent of Neuronal Apoptosis in
Developing Cerebellar Granule Cells
Our results clearly indicate that the NMDAR/calpain-1/PHLLP1/
Akt pro-survival pathway, which we previously identified in
cultured cortical neurons and acute hippocampal slices (Wang
et al., 2013), is active in developing CGCs, where it limits the
extent of CGC apoptosis. Several lines of evidence support
this conclusion. First, basal levels of PHLPP1 were increased
and those of pAkt decreased in fibroblasts of the patient with
a calpain-1-null mutation. Similarly, increased PHLPP1 and
decreased pAkt levels were found in cerebellar homogenates
of calpain-1 KO mice, indicating that calpain-1 activity normally
reduces PHLPP1 levels and maintains Akt activated during the
postnatal period in cerebellum. Second, a decreased density
of pAkt-positive puncta was found in cerebellar granular layer
but not in Purkinje or molecular layer of calpain-1 KO mice, sug-
gesting that calpain-1-dependent regulation of Akt only takes
place in CGCs but not in other cerebellar cell types. Third, cal-
pain-1 KO eliminated NMDA-triggered PHLPP1 cleavage and
Akt activation in acute cerebellar slices, suggesting that cal-
pain-1 is required for NMDAR-activity-dependent regulation of
PHLPP1 and Akt. Fourth, lack of PHLPP1 restored normal levels
of pAkt in developing cerebellum of calpain-1 KO mice, indi-
cating that PHLPP1 is downstream of calpain-1 and that its
level is important for Akt regulation. Finally, reduced Akt activity
was associated with enhanced CGC apoptosis in calpain-1 KO
mice, while increased Akt activity was associated with reduced
CGC apoptosis in bpV-injected WT and in DKO mice.
NMDAR- and calpain-1-mediated neuronal survival during
brain development was not limited to CGCs, as enhanced
apoptosis was present in other brain regions such as cortex,
striatum, and hippocampus in developing calpain-1 KO mice.
Thus, we cannot rule out the possibility that enhanced neuronal
death in other regions of the motor system, such as motor cortex
and striatum, contributes to the motor impairment observed in
calpain-1 KO mice, and possibly humans. Furthermore, the
important roles of calpain-1 in hippocampal neuronal survival
during development and in synaptic plasticity in adult (Wang
et al., 2014; Zhu et al., 2015) may contribute to the cognitive
decline found in ataxia patients with CAPN1 mutations.
Calpain-1-Mediated Survival of Developing Cerebellar
Granule Cells Is Required for Normal Density of Adult
Cerebellar Granule Cells
Elimination of excessive neurons occurs during normal CNS
development. During this process, NMDAR activity is required
for neuronal survival, and only neurons establishing functional
synaptic connections survive during development. This mecha-
nism has been shown in various types of neurons, including
CGCs (Ikonomidou et al., 1999; Monti et al., 2002). In CGCs,
the period of NMDAR dependence is between PND7 and
PND11 (Monti and Contestabile, 2000), which is consistent
with our results showing that MK801 treatment enhanced
CGC apoptosis at PND7 and PND10 but not PND3. Our results
indicate that lack of calpain-1 produces the same pattern of
enhanced apoptosis in developing cerebellum as MK801 treat-
ment in WT mice. Enhanced apoptosis was found at PND7 and
PND10 but not PND3, and most apoptosis occurred in the
external and internal granular layer of cerebellum. Thus, NMDAR
and calpain-1 are in the same signaling cascade required to sup-
port CGC survival. Enhanced apoptosis during postnatal devel-
opment results in reduced CGC density in adult calpain-1 KO
mice, which is consistent with the idea that CGC neurogenesis
in mammalian cerebellum is strictly limited to the early postnatal
period (Altman, 1972).
Despite reduced CGC density, calpain-1 KO mice exhibited
normal overall Purkinje cell morphology (Figure S5B). However,
careful analysis of Purkinje cell spine morphology indicated
that calpain-1 KO resulted in immature spine morphology,
reduced number of GluR2 subunits, reduced number of synaptic
contacts, and reduced synaptic efficiency at PF-PC synapses.
The reduced number of mature spines in Purkinje cells is likely
due to a reduced number of PF-PC synapses, which was caused
by impaired calpain-1-PHLPP1-Akt pathway and reduced CGC
number in calpain-1 KO mice. Many previous publications
showed similar examples in which either loss (Shmerling et al.,
1998) or dysfunction (Chen et al., 1999; Hashimoto et al., 1999)
of cerebellar granule cells leads to impaired PF-PC transmission
and ataxia. In addition, we and another lab previously found
that dysregulation of calpain or Akt affects actin polymerization,
which is important for synapse formation and function and
regulating the shape of the dendritic spines (Briz et al., 2015;
Huang et al., 2013). We previously reported that calpain-1 activa-
tion was critical for induction of long-term potentiation (LTP) at
hippocampal synapses (Wang et al., 2014), and it has been
repeatedly proposed that establishment of synaptic contacts
during the postnatal period might require a mechanism similar
to LTP (Chaudhury et al., 2016). Thus, the absence of calpain-1
at the PF-PC synapses is likely to result in abnormal maturation
of dendritic spines, and decreased synaptic efficiency of these
synapses.
Enhanced neuronal apoptosis and reduced CGC density were
completely reversed by restoring normal levels of phosphory-
lated Akt in cerebellum of calpain-1 KO mice with treatment
with the phosphatase inhibitor bpV during the critical developing
period. While the effect of bpV treatment on Akt activity was not
permanent, the temporary rescue of Akt activation during devel-
opment resulted in normal CGC density in adult, highlighting the
importance of Akt regulation for CGC development. BpV is an
inhibitor of the phosphatase that regulates Akt as well as other
targets (Song et al., 2012). To rule out the possibility that the
rescuing effect of bpV injection could be due to modifications of
other PTEN targets, we generated calpain-1/PHLPP1 DKO mice.
PHLPP1 KO rescued Akt activity and completely prevented CGC
loss caused by calpain-1 KO, prevented the decrease in GluR2
88
Cell Reports 16, 79–91, June 28, 2016
 subunits at PF-PC synapses, and partially reversed the decrease
in synaptic efficiency at these synapse. Finally, it also reversed
the abnormalities in motor function observed in calpain-1 KO
mice. These results clearly indicate that PHLPP1, among other
calpain-1 substrates, has a critical role in the normal develop-
ment of CGCs and the PF-PC synapses.
Conclusions
Lack of calpain-1 or null mutations of calpain-1 are associated
with cerebellar ataxia in mice and humans. Together with the
previous report that a null mutation in dogs also presented with
cerebellar ataxia, these findings identify CAPN1 as a cerebellar
ataxia gene. The identification of the underlying mechanism,
abnormal development of CGCs and PF-PC synapses provides
potential therapeutic treatment for this type of cerebellar ataxia.
In addition, considering the role of calpain-1 in synaptic plasticity
and learning and memory, these results establish a link between
this type of cerebellar ataxia and cognitive deficits.
EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURES
Animal use in all experiments followed NIH guidelines, and all protocols were
approved by the Institution Animal Care and Use Committee of Western Univer-
sity of Health Sciences. Calpain-1 KO mice on a C57Bl/6 background were
generously provided by Dr. Chishti (Tufts University). PHLPP1 KO mice on a
C57/SV129 background were generously provided by Dr. Newton (UCSD).
Calpain-1�/� mice were crossed with PHLPP1�/� to produce calpain-1�/�
PHLPP1�/� (DKO) and calpain-1�/� PHLPP1+/+ (control).
Gait Analysis
Mice were trained for 2 days to walk through the tunnel and then tested for two
trials. Two to four steps from the middle portion of each run were analyzed for
hind-stride length and hind-base width (distance between the right and left
hind-limb strides, sway distance).
Rotarod Test
The experimental procedure was adapted from previously described proce-
dures (Chen et al., 2009; Mulherkar and Jana, 2010; Sun et al., 2015a)
using a rotarod apparatus (Med Associates). The total testing period lasted
8 days, 1 training day followed by 7 trial days. For day 1 training, the rotor
was set at a constant speed of 4 rpm, and animals were placed on the rod
for 30 s. If the animal fell off the rod prior to the end of the 30 s, they were placed
back on the rod. This was repeated until the animal could maintain itself on the
rod for the full 30-s duration. Trial days 1 through 7 consisted of three trials of
5 min each. The rod was set to ramp up from 4 to 40 rpm over the course of
5 min. The trial ended when the animal fell off the rod or at the end of 5 min,
and the latency to fall was recorded in seconds. Trials were repeated three
times per day with at least a 15-min rest period for each animal between trials.
Data were expressed as the average time, in seconds (means ± SEM), of the
latency to fall.
TUNEL Staining
TUNEL staining was performed in six sections at a 240-mm interval from each
cerebellum or in eight sections at 1.54, 0.50, �0.58, �1.58, �1.94, �2.46,
�2.92, and �3.88 Bregma from each cerebrum, using the ApopTag In Situ
Apoptosis Detection Kit (S7165, Millipore), following the manufacturer’s in-
structions. Sections were visualized under a confocal microscope (Nikon).
For cerebellar analysis, the outline of the cerebellum in each image was drawn
using ‘‘freehand selections’’ in ImageJ to exclude the surrounding area.
TUNEL positive nuclei in cerebellar area were counted using ‘‘analyze parti-
cles’’ in ImageJ. Density of TUNEL positive nuclei per square millimeter of
cerebellar area in each section was analyzed. Values of six sections in each
cerebellum were averaged. Visualization and quantification were performed
by a blind observer to avoid bias (see Supplemental Information for details).
H&E Staining and Cell Counting
H&E staining was performed on six sections (10 mm thick) at a 240-mm interval
in each cerebellum, using Hematoxylin solution Harris modified (HHS32,
Sigma) and Eosin Y solution aqueous (HT110232, Sigma). Cell numbers in a
150 3 150 mm2 area in the intermediate stratum of the granular layer (Palkovits
et al., 1971) in each folium were analyzed using ImageJ. Cell densities of all
folia in each section were averaged. Cell densities of six sections in each
cerebellum were then averaged to get the cell density of each cerebellum.
Acute Cerebellar Slice Preparation and Treatment
Cerebellar sagittal slices (400 mm thick) from PND7 WT or calpain-1 KO mice
were prepared as previously described (Wang et al., 2014). After 1 hr recovery,
cerebellar slices were incubated in 2 ml of freshly oxygenated artificial cere-
brospinal fluid (aCSF) medium with 10 mM NMDA for 20 min.
Western Blot
Western blot analysis was performed as previously described (Wang et al.,
2014). The primary antibodies used were calpain-1 (1:1,000, 2556, CST), cal-
pain-2 (1:1,000, LS-B12657, LSBio), PHLPP1 (1:1,000, 07-1341, Millipore),
phospho-Akt Ser473 (1:3,000, 4060, CST), and Akt (1:2,000, 2920).
Calpain Assay
The hydrolysis of the fluorogenic substrate Suc-Leu-Tyr-AMC by calpains in hu-
man fibroblast lysates was performed as previously described (Wang et al.,
2014), with some modifications (see the Supplemental Information for details).
Immunohistochemistry
Immunohistochemistry was performed as previously described (Wang et al.,
2014). The primary antibodies used were rabbit phospho-Akt (Ser473) anti-
body (1:100, 4060, CST), mouse NeuroD1 antibody (1:300, H00004760-M01,
Novus Biologicals), rabbit calbindin antibody (1:500, 13176, CST) antibody,
mouse GluR2 antibody (1:500, MAB397, EMD Millipore), rabbit VGluT1 anti-
body (1:500, ab104898, Abcam), and/or mouse VGluT2 antibody (1:300,
MAB5504, EMD Millipore). For mean fluorescence density (MFI) analysis of
pAkt signal in the cerebellum of PND7 mice, four sagittal sections at a
240-mm interval in each cerebellum were stained and analyzed. In each sec-
tion, four 120 3 30 mm areas in external granular layer were analyzed. MFI
value of pAkt signal in each area was acquired in ImageJ. Averaged MFI in
four sections off each cerebellum was calculated.
For puncta analysis of GluR2 and VGluT1, four sagittal sections at a 240-mm
interval in each cerebellum were stained and analyzed. In each section, four
160-3-80-mm areas in molecular layer were analyzed. The Red and Green
Puncta Colocalization Macro in ImageJ were used to count GluR2, VGluT1,
and co-localized puncta. Averaged densities of GluR2, VGluT1, and co-local-
ized puncta (numbers per100 mm2) in four sections of each cerebellum were
calculated.
For puncta analysis of VGluT2, four sagittal sections at a 240-mm inter-
val in each cerebellum were stained and analyzed. In each section, four
185-3-120-mm regions in Purkinje and molecular layer were analyzed.
VGluT2 puncta in 0%–80% area (excluding cell body layer) of each region
were counted by ImageJ. Averaged densities of VGluT2 puncta (numbers
per 100 mm2) in four sections of each cerebellum were calculated.
Dendritic Spine Analysis
Golgi impregnation was performed in the cerebellum of 3-month-old WT
and calpain-1 KO mice according to FD Rapid GolgiStain Kit instructions
(FD Neurotechnologies). 100-mm sagittal sections of the cerebellum were
sliced. Images of dendritic branches of Purkinje cells were acquired using a
Zeiss light microscope with a 603 objective. Using the Analyze Skeleton plugin
of ImageJ software, spines densities were analyzed in random selected distal
branches between 10 and 20 mm in length. Spine morphology analysis was
performed as previously described with some changes (Miyoshi et al., 2014)
(see the Supplemental Information).
Preparation of Postsynaptic Density Fraction
Preparation of postsynaptic density (PSD) fraction was performed as previ-
ously described (Sun et al., 2015b). Cerebellar cortex of the 3-month-oldmouse
Cell Reports 16, 79–91, June 28, 2016

 was homogenized in ice-cold HEPES-buffered sucrose solution (0.32 M
sucrose, 4 mM HEPES [pH 7.4]) with protease inhibitor cocktail (78446,
Thermo Fisher Scientific). Homogenates were centrifuged at 900 3 g for
10 min to remove large debris (P1). The supernatant (S1) was then centrifuged
at 11,000 3 g for 20 min to obtain the crude synaptosomal (P2) and cytosolic
(S2) fractions. The PSD-enriched fraction (P3) was obtained by incubating P2
pellets in HEPES-buffered sucrose solution plus 0.5% Triton X-100 on ice for
20 min and then centrifuging at 32,000 3 g for 1 hr. Final pellets were sonicated
in resuspension buffer (10 mM Tris [pH 8], 1 mM EDTA, and 1% SDS). Protein
concentrations were determined with a BCA protein assay kit (Pierce). Same
amount of proteins from the S1 fraction and PSD fractions were resolved by
SDS-PAGE and immunoblotted with the indicated antibodies.
Electrophysiology in Acute Cerebellar Slice
Acute cerebellar coronal slices (350 mm) were prepared, and field EPSPs were
evoked by parallel fiber stimulation recorded in the Purkinje cell layer, as pre-
viously described (Barnes et al., 2011). Population spikes were recorded by a
differential amplifier (DAM 50, World Precision Instruments; 10 kHz high- and
300 Hz low-cutoff filter; gain = 1,000) and sampled at 10 kHz on Clampex. A
dissecting microscope was used for visualizing the slices in the recording
chamber, and recording and stimulating electrodes were randomly tested on
the vermal part of the cerebellar slice with a test pulse of 130 mA until a char-
acteristic P1-N1-P2-N2 waveform, as reported in Barnes et al. (2011) was
found. The absolute values of the ratios between the amplitude of N2 and N1
at different stimulation intensities (10–300 mA) were analyzed.
Patients
Autosomal recessive families of Tunisian, Bangladeshi, or European origin
were studied (pedigrees shown in Figures 1 and S1–S3). All families have a clin-
ically similar ataxia. All individuals gave informed consent. The work was
approved by the Office of Human Subjects Research at the NIH and the Univer-
sity College London Hospitals ethics committee (approval no. 06/N076) or Paris
Necker ethics committee (RBM 01-29 and RBM 03-48 to A.D. and A.B.).
Genetic Linkage/Homozygosity Analysis
Family members were genotyped using Illumina CytoSNP12 arrays with
301,232 genome-wide markers, and the raw data were processed in Ge-
nomeStudio (Illumina). Genotypes were examined with the use of a multipoint
parametric linkage analysis and haplotype reconstruction performed with
Simwalk2 (Sobel et al., 2001).
Exome Sequencing
Libraries were prepared using the TruSeq DNA sample prep kit (Illumina) and
1 mg of patient DNA. Fragmentation was performed with the Covaris shearing
system using the 300-bp with size selection by excision from the area between
300 and 400 bp on an agarose gel.
CAPN1 Sanger Sequencing
To validate the results of exome sequencing and screen controls, primers were
designed using Primer3 to amplify the entire CAPN1 gene (primers available on
request). Clean PCR product was sequenced using BigDye Terminator 3.1
chemistry (Life Technologies) and cleaned with Millipore filter plates prior to
capillary electrophoresis on an ABI 3130XL Genetic Analyzer (ABI Biosystems).
Statistical Analyses
In all cases, error bars indicate SEM. N values represent numbers of animals
tested. To compute p values, unpaired Student’s t test, one-way ANOVA,
and two-way ANOVA followed by Bonferroni test were used, as indicated in
the figure legends.
