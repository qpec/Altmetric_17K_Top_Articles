Aims: The primary aim of the CANagliflozin cardioVascular Assessment Study–Renal (CANVAS-R)
is to determine whether the favourable effects of inhibition of the sodium glucose co-transporter 2
(SGLT2) on blood glucose, blood pressure and body weight are accompanied by protection against
adverse renal outcomes.
Materials and methods: CANVAS-R is a prospective, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled
trial in patients with type 2 diabetes with a history or high risk of cardiovascular events. Patients
were randomly assigned to once-daily placebo or canagliflozin 100 mg (with optional uptitration to
300 mg) for a planned average of 2.5 years of follow-up. The primary outcome is kidney disease
progression, defined by class change in albuminuria. The two secondary outcomes are the compos-
ite of hospitalized heart failure or cardiovascular death, and cardiovascular death alone. Effects on
end-stage renal disease and a range of other outcomes will also be explored.
Results: A total of 5812 participants were recruited at 422 sites in 24 countries between Janu-
ary 2014 and May 2015. The mean baseline age was 64 years, mean duration of diabetes
was 14 years, mean glycated haemoglobin level was 8.3% and mean body mass index was
32 kg/m2. Of these participants, 37% were women, 71% had a history of cardiovascular dis-
ease, 22.3% had microalbuminuria and 8.7% had macroalbuminuria. The mean baseline esti-
mated glomerular filtration rate was 76 mL/min/1.73 m2. The study will have at least 90%
power (P = .05) to detect a 22% or greater reduction in the risk of progression of albuminuria.
Conclusions: The trial should define the potential renoprotective effect of canagliflozin and will
provide additional important new data about its effects on vascular outcomes, death and kid-
ney failure.

INTRODUCTION
Type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) is associated with a significant
global health burden,1 and kidney disease is a frequent complication
closely associated with an increased risk of adverse cardiovascular
outcomes. Renal haemodynamic changes and increased leakage of
albumin into the urine (microalbuminuria) are the first signs of kidney
involvement and predict an increased risk of progression to end-stage
renal disease (ESRD), requiring dialysis, transplantation or both. The
global epidemic of T2DM has made diabetes the leading reason for ESRD
requiring dialysis in most countries.1 Interventions to prevent the develop-
ment and progression of chronic kidney disease, in conjunction with the
prevention of other cardiovascular events, are therefore a priority.
Effective control of blood glucose levels, blood pressure, blood lipids
and albuminuria is the current mainstay of therapy for the prevention of
cardiovascular and renal disease in patients with T2DM. Drugs that tar-
get these risk factors have proven effective in preventing serious renal
and cardiovascular endpoints.2–7 The first large trial of a sodium glucose
co-transporter 2 (SGLT2) inhibitor was completed last year and sug-
gested protective effects of empagliflozin against a range of vascular and
renal outcomes.8,9 Summary data for all SGLT2 inhibitors suggest that
similar effects can be anticipated from other compounds in the class.10
The
CANagliflozin
cardioVascular
Assessment
Study–Renal
(CANVAS-R) trial will test the effect of canagliflozin on the primary out-
come of renal disease progression in T2DM by defining the effect on
transitions between normoalbuminuria, microalbuminuria and macroal-
buminuria. Alone, and in conjunction with the ongoing CANVAS trial,11
it will also provide important new data about the effects of the com-
pound on vascular outcomes, death and chronic kidney disease.
The primary objective of CANVAS-R is to determine the effects of
canagliflozin compared with placebo on the progression of albuminuria
against a background of standard of care. The primary null hypothesis to
be tested is that there is no difference in the progression of albuminuria
between patients treated with canagliflozin and those treated with pla-
cebo. The secondary objectives of the study are to determine the effects
of canagliflozin compared with placebo on, first, the composite outcome
of hospitalization for heart failure or cardiovascular death and, second, on
cardiovascular death alone. Exploratory outcomes will include regression
of albuminuria, albumin-to-creatinine ratio (ACR), estimated glomerular fil-
tration rate (eGFR) and composite major renal outcomes. The cardiovas-
cular outcome data from the CANVAS-R trial will also be combined with
the data from CANVAS (ClinicalTrials.gov Identifier: NCT01032629) in an
integrated analysis to enable the better evaluation of the cardiovascular
safety and efficacy of canagliflozin.

MATERIALS AND METHODS
CANVAS-R
is
a
randomized,
double-blind,
placebo-controlled,
parallel-group, multicentre trial (Figure 1). The study has received
approval from national regulatory agencies in 24 countries and the
local ethics committees of all participating sites. The study is being
conducted in accordance with ethical principles that comply with the
Declaration of Helsinki, Good Clinical Research Practices and applica-
ble regulatory requirements. Recruitment commenced in January
2014 and was completed at 422 participating sites in May 2015. The
trial is registered at ClinicalTrials.gov (NCT01989754).
2.1
| Participant inclusion and exclusion criteria
Participants in the CANVAS-R trial are men and women with T2DM who
had inadequate glycaemic control at baseline (glycated haemoglobin
[HbA1c] ≥7.0% and ≤10.5%) and have a history or are at an elevated risk
of cardiovascular disease. All participants were required to provide
informed consent, to be willing and able to adhere to the study protocol
and to successfully complete the trial’s placebo run-in period. To ensure
the recruitment of a broad population group, there were minimal restric-
tions on the use of background therapies for glucose control or cardiovas-
cular risk factor management. The inclusion criteria were designed to be
identical to the twinned CANVAS study and were powered to achieve an
event rate of ≥2.25% per year11 for the cardiovascular outcome (cardio-
vascular death, myocardial infarction or stroke) so that the data can be
seamlessly integrated with data from CANVAS to address safety, as sti-
pulated by the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA), and efficacy.12
Accordingly, participants were either aged ≥30 years with a history of
symptomatic atherosclerotic vascular disease (coronary, cerebrovascu-
lar or peripheral) or aged ≥50 years with ≥2 of the following risk fac-
tors for vascular disease: duration of diabetes ≥10 years, systolic blood
pressure >140 mmHg while on ≥1 antihypertensive agent, current
smoker, microalbuminuria, or macroalbuminuria, or HDL cholesterol
<1 mmol/L. The intent was to include 70% of individuals with a history
of cardiovascular disease and 30% with ≥2 disease risk factors by the
capping of recruitment. Other inclusion and exclusion criteria were
consistent with those typically used for a trial of this stage in this
patient group and are identical to those used in the separate CANVAS
trial (Appendix S1). This study uses the same adjudication committee
and Independent Data Monitoring Committee (IDMC) as CANVAS.
2.2
| Screening and run-in
All potential participants completed a 2-week, single-blind, placebo
run-in period if screening criteria were met. If eligibility was confirmed,
the participant was counselled about diet and exercise, trained in the
recognition of hypoglycaemia, provided with materials for making self-
monitored blood glucose measurements and then provided with single-
blind placebo therapy. The primary purpose of the run-in period was to
exclude individuals who were unlikely to adhere to the long-term treat-
ment and follow-up regimen required by the trial.
2.3
| Randomization
Randomization was carried out centrally through an interactive web
response system. Participants were randomly assigned in a 1:1 ratio
to canagliflozin or matching placebo on the basis of a computer-
generated randomization schedule that was prepared by the study
sponsor using randomly permuted blocks.
2.4
| Post-randomization study treatment and
control
Study treatment is provided in identical bottles for both canagliflozin
and matching placebo. Canagliflozin was administered at an initial
388
NEAL ET AL.
 dose of 100 mg daily but, at week 13 (or any time thereafter), the
dose of canagliflozin (or matching placebo) may be increased from
100 to 300 mg. Uptitration is encouraged if the participant requires
additional glycaemic control (eg, if ≥50% of glucose measurements from
fasting fingerstick readings exceeded 6 mmol/L [110 mg/dL] during the
2 weeks preceding) and there has been no hypoglycaemia, volume deple-
tion or other adverse event that might preclude dose increase. Partici-
pants are instructed to take the study treatment once daily before the
first meal of the day until completion of the study or premature treat-
ment discontinuation. Participants and all study staff will be masked to
individual treatment allocation until the completion of the study.
2.5
| Background drug treatments
Use of SGLT2 inhibitors is precluded, but participants are otherwise
free to use other background therapy for glycaemic management at
the discretion of the responsible investigator, in line with applicable
local guidelines. Likewise, the use of all other therapies, particularly
for cardiovascular and renal risk factors, will be according to best
practice throughout the course of the study, instituted according to
local guidelines and policies.
2.6
| Follow-up schedule
Post-randomization, face-to-face follow-up is scheduled for 13 and
26 weeks after randomization and at 6-month intervals thereafter. Addi-
tionally, telephone follow-up is scheduled at 6 weeks, 9 months and
every 6 months thereafter, such that it alternates with the face-to-face
visits. Every follow-up contact includes an inquiry about adverse events
and concomitant therapies. All face-to-face visits also include provision of
study medication and recording of physical measurements. First morning
urinary ACR and serum creatinine levels are measured every 6 months.
After the year 1 visit, clinical laboratory assessments are performed every
6 or 12 months. Individuals who prematurely discontinue study treatment
are encouraged to return for regular assessments to ensure full ascertain-
ment of study outcomes and to support an intention-to-treat analysis for
all outcomes. Patient retention is supported by flexibility in the follow-up
regimen such that investigators can schedule additional visits or reduce
the intensity of follow-up as required. Further, the consent process
included agreement by the participant for the investigator to consult fam-
ily members, the participant’s physicians, medical records or public records
in the event they are not reachable by conventional means.
2.7
| Outcomes
The primary outcome is progression of albuminuria, which is defined as
a change from normoalbuminuria to microalbuminuria or macroalbumi-
nuria, or from microalbuminuria to macroalbuminuria, accompanied by
an ACR value increase of ≥30% from baseline. The main analysis will be
on incident events, with a supplementary analysis carried out that is
restricted to events with duplicate measures of progressions in which a
repeat ACR collection was carried out ~1 to 2 months later to identify
sustained progression of albuminuria. In the circumstance where the
last recorded ACR value meets the definition of progression, it will be
deemed to be a sustained progression for the subsidiary analysis. ACR
assessments will be based on values obtained from duplicate first
morning void urines and analysed by a central laboratory. The second-
ary outcomes are (1) the composite of hospitalization for heart failure
or cardiovascular death and (2) cardiovascular death.
Exploratory outcomes will be (1) regression of albuminuria, defined
as change to normoalbuminuria in a patient with baseline microalbumi-
nuria or macroalbuminuria or change to microalbuminuria in a patient
with baseline macroalbuminuria, accompanied by a decrease in the uri-
nary ACR value of ≥30% from baseline. A supplementary analysis of
sustained regression will be performed that is restricted to events
where regression is observed in duplicate assays; (2) change in eGFR
from baseline to the last off-treatment value, with eGFR calculated
using the Modification of Diet in Renal Disease (MDRD) formula13;
(3) urinary ACR; (4) the composite of a 40% reduction in eGFR, renal
death or the requirement for renal replacement therapy; (5) the com-
posite of a 40% reduction in eGFR, renal death, the requirement for
renal replacement therapy or cardiovascular death; and (6) the compos-
ite of the development of macroalbuminuria, a 40% reduction in eGFR,
renal death or the requirement for renal replacement therapy. The last
three exploratory outcomes will also be assessed by substituting the
40% reduction in eGFR with doubling of serum creatinine (which
equates to an approximate 57% reduction in eGFR). Other exploratory
analyses include on-treatment GFR slope, change in HbA1c and utiliza-
tion of antihyperglycaemic therapy.
Given the planned concordance in study design and patient popu-
lation enrolled between the CANVAS-R and CANVAS studies, an inte-
grated analysis will be performed to evaluate the cardiovascular safety
and efficacy of canagliflozin using a closed testing procedure to control
for type 1 error across the integrated analysis and CANVAS-R study at
5%. Safety data on acidosis,14 malignancies, fatal pancreatitis, pancrea-
titis,
severe
hypersensitivity
reactions,
photosensitivity
reactions,
hepatic injury, acute kidney injury, venous thromboembolic events,
fractures, male genital infections, amputation and pregnancy are also
being systematically collected to provide better insight into the safety
of the compound. The vascular safety events will all be reviewed by an
Independent Endpoint Adjudication Committee, in addition to all other
deaths, fractures, ESRD events and hospitalization for heart failure.
2.8
| Statistical power
Based on the interim data from the canagliflozin development pro-
gramme, it was projected that the annual albuminuria progression rate
for the CANVAS-R study will be ~7.4% in the placebo arm. Assuming
an 18-month accrual period, a minimum follow-up period of 18 months
and an annual discontinuation (from treatment) rate of 10%, this was
projected to provide >90% power (2-sided P = .05) to detect a 22%
relative risk reduction for the primary outcome of albuminuria progres-
sion. This period of follow-up will also allow the accrual of sufficient
major adverse cardiovascular events between this trial and CANVAS,
such that the FDA post-marketing requirements can be met.
2.9
| Analysis
Analyses will be performed using the intention-to-treat population, and
a P value of 0.05 will be taken to indicate a statistically significant
effect. The primary efficacy analysis will seek to demonstrate the
NEAL ET AL.
389
 superiority of canagliflozin compared with placebo for the prevention
of albuminuria progression. The geometric mean of the duplicate
ACR measurements collected at each visit will be computed, and
patients
will
be
classified
as
having
normoalbuminuria
(urinary ACR of <3.5 mg/mmol [<30 mg/g]), microalbuminuria (ACR
≥3.5 mg/mmol [≥30 mg/g] and ≤35 mg/mmol [≤300 mg/g]) or macro-
albuminuria (ACR of >35 mg/mmol [>300 mg/g]) at each time point.
The time from randomization to the first visit date at which progres-
sion of albuminuria is recorded will be analysed using a Cox propor-
tional hazards regression model. Appropriate correction will be made
for regression to the mean. The model will include treatment and base-
line albuminuria status as covariates. The hazard ratio comparing cana-
gliflozin and placebo will be estimated with its 95% confidence
interval. For participants who do not experience progression of albumi-
nuria, censoring will be the visit date of the last albuminuria measure-
ment. The cumulative progression rate derived from the Kaplan-Meier
estimate will be displayed graphically to illustrate the timing of progres-
sion and to explore the consistency of the treatment effect over time.
The secondary efficacy analyses will use Cox proportional hazards
models. A closed testing procedure will be implemented to control for
the overall type 1 error at 5% for the primary and secondary endpoints
across CANVAS-R and CANVAS with the hypotheses for the primary
and secondary endpoints in CANVAS-R tested sequentially as part of a
testing family. There are no interim analyses planned.
2.10
| Trial management
Scientific responsibility for the design, analysis and reporting of the
trial lies with the Steering Committee, which comprises 6 independent
academic researchers and a representative of the trial sponsor. After
trial completion, the Steering Committee will have full access to the
trial database and will conduct analyses of the main trial outcomes
independent of the sponsor. Day-to-day operation of the trial is man-
aged jointly by the sponsor and an academic research organization;
broadly, the academic research organization is responsible for the
management of the various trial committees and operations in the
Asia-Pacific region, with the sponsor having primary responsibility for
other geographic regions and functions. An independent data moni-
toring committee has been established to provide interim monitoring
of unblinded safety data throughout the course of the trial.

RESULTS/CURRENT STATUS
During a recruitment period of 16 months, 7800 individuals were
screened and 5812 were randomized (Figure 2). A total of 1988 indi-
viduals were not randomized; more than two-thirds of these indivi-
duals were excluded because HbA1c was out of range, with smaller
proportions excluded on the basis of other laboratory results, cardio-
vascular risk criteria, a low eGFR or diverse other reasons. One indi-
vidual was randomized at 2 sites and has been removed from follow-
up and analysis. Findings are therefore reported for 5811 individuals,
amongst whom accrued follow-up was 8737 patient-years by August
2016.
The
corresponding
mean
duration
of
follow-up
was
78.5 weeks, the median duration was 78 weeks and the maximum
duration was 122 weeks.
The mean age of the participants at baseline was 64 years and
37% were women (Table 1). A total of 4765 (82.0%) participants
were white, with most of the remainder being of Asian descent. The
average time from diagnosis of diabetes was 13.7 years, with 4652
participants (80.1%) using metformin, 2325 (40.0%) a sulphonylurea,
310 (5.3%) a glucagon-like peptide-1 receptor agonist and 2905
(50.0%) insulin. As would be anticipated for a group with long-
standing diabetes, many patients were on multiple glucose-lowering
therapies. The majority were also using a statin (76.6%) and large
numbers of participants were prescribed antithrombotic therapy
(75.1%). A total of 1263 (21.7%) and 1114 (19.2%) of those rando-
mized had diagnoses of retinopathy and nephropathy, respectively,
while 1762 participants (30.3%) had neuropathy. A total of 70.5%
reported a history of macrovascular atherosclerotic vascular disease
at entry into the study and 15.9% reported a history of heart failure.
The mean baseline body mass index was 32 kg/m2 and the mean
HbA1c was 8.3%. Baseline blood pressure was 137/78 mmHg, total
cholesterol was 4.4 mmol/L, HDL cholesterol was 1.2 mmol/L, LDL
cholesterol was 2.3 mmol/L and triglycerides were 2.1 mmol/L.
Microalbuminuria
was
present
in
22.3%
(median
urinary
ACR
8.0 mmol/mg)
of
participants
and
8.7%
had
macroalbuminuria
(median urinary ACR 83.5 mmol/mg). The mean eGFR was 76 mL/
min/1.73 m2 and the median was 75 mL/min/1.73 m2.

DISCUSSION
The CANVAS-R trial has successfully randomized 5811 individuals
with T2DM. The characteristics of the participants are typical of
those of a high-risk population with diabetes, both in terms of the
nature of the complications reported and the types of treatments
that they are receiving. The proportion of participants with a history
of atherosclerotic vascular disease is higher than is typically observed
in this patient group but this reflects the inclusion criteria that tar-
geted the enrolment of individuals with ischaemic macrovascular
complications. The CANVAS-R population characteristics are directly
comparable with those of the ongoing CANVAS trial,11 which will
ensure that a robust assessment of effects on cardiovascular and
other outcomes can be made across the integrated data from the
twin studies. Individuals with these characteristics are at a substan-
tially elevated risk of both cardiovascular and renal complications,

 and CANVAS-R will provide substantial new insight into the effects
of canagliflozin on renal function and vascular disease.
The exploration of canagliflozin as a novel strategy for the pre-
vention of the renal complications of diabetes is based on strong
preliminary data. SGLT2 inhibitors have been shown to lower glu-
cose, blood pressure and body weight.12,15 Initial data from a subset
of participants in the canagliflozin development programme that
were available at the time of study design suggested protection
against albuminuria, with mean changes in the ACR of +28 mg/g for
placebo, −22 mg/g for canagliflozin 100 mg and −41 mg/g for cana-
gliflozin 300 mg.16 The mechanism of the glucose lowering based
on tubular wasting of glucose is well understood and a plausible
explanation of the antihypertensive effect is sodium excretion
resulting from the inhibition of the joint sodium glucose co-trans-
porter.13 The mechanism of the albuminuria reduction remains to be
determined. Possibilities include reduction in intraglomerular pres-
sure induced by glomerular tubular feedback or atrial natriuretic
peptide, modification of tubular albumin reabsorption, changes in
the glycocalyx or reduced filtration as a result of reduction in
eGFR.17,18
The change in albuminuria class selected as the primary out-
come for CANVAS-R has been used in multiple previous renal out-
come trials,2,4,19–22 and positive effects on albuminuria class
change resulted in the European Medicines Agency (EMA) provid-
ing a labelled indication for irbesartan as a treatment for patients
with microalbuminuria and diabetes. Consistent with the move
towards earlier intervention in diabetic nephropathy, there are
ongoing discussions regarding the potential for albuminuria class
transition to serve as an outcome for which an indication might be
provided in other clinical settings. In the meantime, however, it
will be necessary to demonstrate that any benefits of canagliflozin
on albuminuria will translate into protection against ESRD. This
line of investigation has received support in recent months after
post hoc analyses of the EMPA-REG OUTCOME trial that have
identified potential large protective effects of the compound
against both albuminuria and ESRD.9 Accordingly, exploratory
analyses of the effects of canagliflozin on a range of clinical renal
outcomes have been added to the CANVAS-R protocol. Analysis
of these outcomes within CANVAS-R, along with analyses of the
same exploratory outcomes across the integrated data from the
CANVAS-R and CANVAS trials, will provide additional near-term
information about the effects of canagliflozin and the broader
SGLT2 class on hard renal outcomes. Ultimately, the effects of
SGLT2 inhibition on the development of ESRD will need to be
defined in a dedicated renal trial, and the Canagliflozin and Renal
Events in Diabetes with Established Nephropathy Clinical Evalua-
tion (CREDENCE) study (NCT02065791) has been initiated for
that purpose.
In addition to the renal outcomes, the EMPA-REG OUTCOME
trial also showed positive findings for cardiovascular outcomes, with
particularly large benefits observed for vascular death and heart fail-
ure.10 Confirmation of these findings as a class effect for SGLT2 inhi-
bitors is urgently required and these outcomes have been defined as
secondary outcomes for the CANVAS-R trial in a protocol update. As
for the other CANVAS-R outcomes, there will be a parallel evaluation
of the efficacy effects across the integrated data from the twin
CANVAS-R and CANVAS studies in order to maximize statistical
power.
Several recent concerns have been raised regarding potential
adverse effects of SGLT2 inhibitors, and better safety data are
required. Most recently, an elevated risk of amputation was
reported by the data monitoring committee of CANVAS,11 and the
EMA is now seeking data about this outcome for all registered
drugs in the SGLT2 class.23 Diabetic ketoacidosis has also been
noted
as an
uncommon,
but
serious,
side
effect
of SGLT2
inhibitors,14 and a possible increased risk of fracture has also been
identified for canagliflozin24 and in patients with moderate renal
impairment treated with dapagliflozin.25 While the absolute risk of
serious side effects appears to be small, and the IDMC for the
trials has recommended continuation, these observations provide a
further imperative to quantify fully the overall impact of SGLT2
inhibition on all important outcomes. Only with data from large-
scale trials, such as CANVAS-R, will a robust estimate of the over-
all balance of risks and benefits be obtained. Future studies that
include, for example, serial imaging of the heart might provide
helpful additional insight into the mechanism of the macrovascular
protection afforded. Likewise, retinal imaging studies would reveal
whether protective effects on the renal microvasculature are mir-
rored elsewhere.
The ongoing large renal/cardiovascular outcome trials for canagli-
flozin will deliver substantial new data and will provide patients and

 clinicians with the information they need to make fully informed deci-
sions about the optimum use of canagliflozin for the management of
diabetes in general and, in particular, progression of the identified
comorbidities.
