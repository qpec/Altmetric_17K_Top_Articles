IMPORTANCE The effect of vaccination on emergency department (ED) utilization for herpes
zoster (HZ) has not been examined to date.
OBJECTIVE To determine trends in US ED utilization and costs associated with HZ.
DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS The Nationwide Emergency Department Sample data
set was examined for temporal trends in the number of visits and costs for treatment of HZ
in EDs in the United States from January 1, 2006, through December 31, 2013. Cases of HZ
were identified using validated International Classification of Diseases, Ninth Revision–Clinical
Modification diagnosis codes. Patients were stratified by age: less than 20 years (varicella
vaccine recommended), 20 to 59 years (no vaccine recommended), and 60 years or older
(HZ vaccine recommended). Population-based rates were estimated using sampling weights.
MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES Population-based incidence rates of HZ-related ED visits,
charge for ED services, and total charges.
RESULTS A total of 1 350 957 ED visits for HZ were identified between 2006 and 2013,
representing 0.13% of all US ED visits. Of these patients, 563 200 (51.7%) were male; mean
(SE) age was 54.0 (0.1) years. Between 2006 and 2013, the percentage of HZ-related ED
visits increased from 0.13% to 0.14% (8.3%). This growth was driven by patients aged 20 to
59 years (increase of 22.8% [from 0.12% to 0.14% of ED visits]) while the proportion of ED HZ
visits decreased for patients aged less than 20 years and 60 years or older, from 0.03% to
0.02% (−39.6%) and from 0.28% to 0.25% (−10.9%), respectively. For all age groups, there
was an increase from 2006 to 2013 in overall adjusted total (from $92.83 to $202.47 million)
and mean charges (from $763 to $1262) for HZ-related ED visits.
CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE The number of ED visits and total cost associated with HZ
increased between 2006 and 2013. Greater use was driven by an increased number of visits
by patients aged 20 to 59 years, but populations recommended for vaccination (<20 and
�60 years) demonstrated decreased ED utilization. Per-visit and total costs increased across
all age groups. Vaccination may be associated with a reduction of ED utilization. Further
research is required to confirm these results and examine the drivers of increased ED costs.

 H
erpes zoster (HZ), or shingles, is caused by reactiva-
tion of the HZ virus, the same virus that causes
varicella.1 One-third of individuals in the United States
willdevelopHZintheirlifetime,withtheriskincreasingsharply
after age 50 years.2 Any individual who has had varicella or re-
ceived the varicella vaccine can develop HZ, although the risk
is lower in those who are vaccinated.3
The rate of HZ has been increasing gradually over many
years in the United States and other countries. The reason for
this trend is currently unknown.4-6 According to a hypothesis
proposed by Hope-Simpson, exposure to primary varicella or
subclinical latent varicella zoster virus can boost varicella zos-
ter virus–specific immunity and reduce the risk of HZ.7 A live-
attenuatedvaccineforvaricellawasintroducedintotheUSvac-
cination schedule in 1995 for children aged 12 months or older,
with subsequent significant declines in the incidence of vari-
cella. Although vaccination rates were slow at first, they
reached 89% in 2006 in children aged 19 to 35 months.8 Ob-
servationalstudiessuggestthatindividualsvaccinatedforvari-
cella are at a decreased risk of developing HZ.3 However, stud-
ies examining the effect on the overall population rates in the
United States with observation periods ranging from 1992
through 2010 have been inconclusive.3-6,9
A live-attenuated vaccine for HZ has been available in the
United States since 2006. The vaccine reduces the likelihood
ofdevelopingHZby51.3%inindividualsaged60yearsorolder,
and vaccinated individuals who develop HZ usually have less
severe disease. In 2008, the Advisory Committee on Immu-
nization Practices (ACIP) recommended zoster vaccine live for
the prevention of HZ and its complications among adults aged
60 years or older.2 Vaccination rates in this population in-
creased from 6.7% in 2008 to 24.2% in 2013.10,11
To our knowledge, there are no data on nationwide emer-
gency department (ED) utilization, hospitalization, and costs
related to HZ and limited data on trends of disease since rou-
tine varicella vaccination was implemented in 1995 for chil-
dren, as well as both before and after the ACIP recommenda-
tion of HZ vaccination in 2008. We hypothesized that, despite
the increased incidence of HZ, the introduction of the HZ vac-
cine in 2008 led to attenuation of severe disease and reduc-
tion of ED utilization for patients aged 60 years or older with
HZ. We additionally hypothesized that routine varicella vac-
cination decreased ED utilization for HZ in patients aged less
than 20 years.
In this study, we used the Nationwide Emergency Depart-
ment Sample (NEDS) to evaluate trends in ED utilization and
costs to assess the potential impact of routine varicella vacci-
nation and HZ vaccination.
Methods
Data Source
We conducted a US population–based, descriptive epidemio-
logic study of HZ-related ED visits from 2006 through 2013
using the NEDS, a nationally representative all-payer data-
base that includes a 20% stratified sample of US community
hospitals and contains data on approximately 130 million ED
visits per year when weighted.12 Cases of HZ were identified
by a primary International Classification of Diseases, Ninth Re-
vision–Clinical Modification (ICD-9-CM) code of 053.x, which
has been shown to detect HZ with 98% sensitivity and a posi-
tive predictive value between 85% and 100%.13-15 The Part-
nersHealthcareInstitutionalReviewBoardapprovedthestudy
and granted an exemption for use of deidentified data from the
NEDS database.
Statistical Analysis
We estimated the number of population-based total and
HZ-related ED visits using sampling weights, clusters, and
strata provided in the NEDS databases for each year. We
stratified patients into the following age groups: less than 20
years, 20 to 59 years, and 60 years or older. Population-
based incidence rates were calculated using US Census
Bureau American FactFinder.16 Emergency department
charges were adjusted to 2016 dollars using the Consumer
Price Index adjustments for medical care.17 Separate logistic
regression models for each age group were used to estimate
the change in the log odds of a HZ visit per 1-year increase in
the survey, and significant coefficients were interpreted as a
trend in the probability of an HZ visit over the survey time
period. We used the Rao-Scott χ2 test to compare the propor-
tion of visits for HZ from 2006-2007 with those from 2008-
2013 among patients 60 years or older. P values <.05 were
considered statistically significant. All tests were 2-tailed
except for the Rao-Scott χ2 test, which is 1-tailed. All group
comparisons were unpaired. Analyses were performed with
survey procedures in SAS, version 9.4 (SAS Institute Inc).
Results
From 2006 to 2013, there were 1 350 957 visits to the ED for
HZ,whichrepresented0.13%ofallEDvisitsintheUnitedStates
(Table 1). When stratified by age groups, visits by patients 60
years or older represented 42.3% of all ED visits for HZ com-
pared with representing 21.3% of ED visits without a primary
diagnosis of HZ. Most patients were women (58.3%) and there
was a slightly higher number of visits for HZ in the summer
Key Points
Question What is the effect of vaccination on emergency
department utilization for herpes zoster?
Findings In this population-based, descriptive epidemiologic
study of more than 1.3 million herpes zoster–related emergency
department visits from 2006 through 2013, the overall rate of
visits rose by 8.3%, driven by an increased number of visits by
patients aged 20 to 59 years; populations recommended for
vaccination (aged <20 and �60 years) demonstrated a decrease
in utilization. Herpes zoster annual incidence rates fell after the
recommended use of the herpes zoster vaccine in 2008 in
patients 60 years or older.
Meaning Vaccination may be associated with a reduction of
emergency department utilization for herpes zoster.

 months (June through August). Overall, 7.2% of patients who
presented to the ED with a primary diagnosis of HZ were ad-
mitted, with a mean (SE) length of stay of 4.72 (0.04) days
(Table 1). The percentage of patients admitted declined from
2006 to 2013 for all age groups. We found that the overall per-
centage of HZ-related ED visits (Figure 1), population-based in-
cidence rates (eTable in the Supplement), percentage admit-
ted, and mean ED and inpatient charges, rose with increasing
age (Table 2).
From 2006 to 2013, the overall population-based rate for
HZ-related ED visits increased from 51.57 to 59.44 per 100 000
persons per year (15.2%). The overall percentage of HZ-
related ED visits also increased from 0.13% to 0.14% (8.3%).
After stratifying the sample into age groups (<20, 20-59, and
≥60 years), the percentage of ED HZ visits from 2006 to 2013
increased for patients 20 to 59 years from 0.12% to 0.14%
(22.8%) (Figure 1). The percentage of ED HZ visits decreased
for the <20 years and 60 years or older groups, from 0.03% to
0.02% (−39.6%) and from 0.28% to 0.25% (−10.9%), respec-
tively (P < .001 for the change in odds of an HZ visit by year
for all age groups).
For all age groups, there was an increase from 2006 to
2013 in overall adjusted total (from $92.83 to $202.47 mil-
lion) and mean charges (from $763 to $1262) for HZ-related
ED visits (Figure 2 and Figure 3). For patients 60 years or
older, although incidence rates declined, total charges
increased by 110%. This rise was due to an increase in that
population, as well as a greater mean charge per visit.
Adjusted mean charges per HZ-related ED visit increased the
most for patients 60 years or older (75.5%) from 2006 to
2013 compared with those 20 to 59 years (57.3%) and less
than 20 years (58.6%) (Figure 3). The increases in adjusted
mean charges per ED visit for HZ outpaced those seen for all
ED visits for any indication for patients 60 years or older and
those less than 20 years, which increased by 72.8% and
45.9%, respectively, but were similar for the 20- to 59-year
age group (59.5%).

 Discussion
We identified increasing utilization and costs associated with
treatment of HZ in US EDs. Although the overall proportion of
ED visits for HZ is increasing marginally (0.13% to 0.14% from
2006 to 2013), stratification by age revealed that this growth
is driven by patients between ages 20 and 59 years, while
youngerandolderpatientshavehadfewerEDvisitsforHZover
time. We found that a higher percentage of women presented
to the ED with HZ (58.3%), which is consistent with the re-
sults of almost all studies identifying a greater disease bur-
den among women.2 However, women were also higher uti-
lizers of the ED for any indication (Table 1).
The trends in ED utilization may reflect a combination of
influences. Patients seen in the ED for HZ must (1) develop
HZ and (2) choose the ED as their venue of care. The trends
that we observed thus could be attributable to trends in the
incidence of HZ and/or ED utilization among different age
groups. We found that, although the overall incidence rate of
ED visits for all indications for patients 60 years or older and
those less than 20 years remained stable from 2006 to 2013,
there was a decrease in the rate of ED visits for HZ for these
age groups. This finding suggests that the observed decrease
may be due to a reduced disease incidence among individu-
als vaccinated for varicella (<20 years) and those who qualify
for HZ vaccination (≥60 years), potentially providing further
insight into the population-level impact of vaccination.
Although we found a significant difference in the propor-
tion of ED visits related to HZ before and after the recom-
mendeduseoftheHZvaccinein2008(P < .001)inthe60years
or older age group, we were unable to perform a similar analy-
sis examining the effect of the varicella vaccination (which was
introduced into the vaccination schedule in 1995) on HZ inci-
dence in the younger than 20–year age group since the NEDS
database started in 2006. Thus, the decline seen in this popu-
lation could have been associated with other factors. How-
ever, the decrease in HZ incidence in patients aged less than

 20 years is consistent with prior studies in the outpatient set-
ting that found a stabilization or decrease in age-specific in-
cidenceofHZinthevaricella-vaccinatedpopulationbeforeand
after 1996.4,5 Among patients aged 20 to 59 years, there was
an increase in the rate of HZ-related ED visits from 2006 to
2013, which may have been partially due to an elevated rate
of ED visits for all indications in this age group. However, HZ-
related ED visits represented an increasing percentage of all
ED visits over this time period, which suggests a rising dis-
ease incidence in this age group.
Other studies have found an increasing incidence of HZ in
the United States and other countries, consistent with our
findings.2,18-21 The cause for this elevation in disease burden
is unclear and is likely multifactorial. The age-specific in-
creased rate of HZ-related ED visits in patients aged 20 to 59
years may be explained in part by the Hope-Simpson hypoth-
esis that increased varicella zoster virus vaccination has led
to a rise in overall HZ incidence.7 However, other studies have
found that the rate of HZ was rising before introduction of rou-
tine varicella zoster virus vaccination and that this increased
rate did not accelerate after routine vaccination was started.19
Unfortunately, the NEDS data collection began in 2006 and we
could not examine prior trends.
The substantial increase in costs is also likely to be mul-
tifactorial. The NEDS database does not provide insight into
the treatments administered at each visit, and it is unclear
whether changes in practice (additional testing or imaging) or
increased costs for similar therapeutics are the culprit.
These findings suggest that, although vaccination rates
may be correlated with a broader effect on HZ incidence and
downstream utilization of ED services, reduction in disease in-
cidence or ED presentation may be insufficient to reduce over-
all health care expense. Further research is needed to iden-
tify drivers of increased costs and implement interventions to
streamline treatment and evaluation of patients with HZ. Cur-
rently, there is a subunit vaccine containing varicella zoster vi-
rus glycoprotein E and the AS01B adjuvant system (called HZ/
su) being evaluated for the prevention of HZ. Because it is not
a live vaccine, the HZ subunit vaccine is considered safe for
individualswhoareimmunocompromisedandhasbeenfound
to have an efficacy rate of 97.2% in adults 50 years or older in
a phase 3 trial. This vaccine may provide a means by which we
can reverse the disease burden and associated costs of HZ in
this population.22
Limitations
These results must be interpreted in the context of our study
design. Although we present these changes in ED utilization
overaperiodmarkedbytheintroductionofvaccines,thisstudy
does not allow us to directly link change in utilization to vac-
cination. This limitation is especially true in the context of the
substantial change in the American health care system that oc-
curred during the study period—the real driver of changes in
ED presentation and cost may be larger systems issues. Aside
from primary payer type, there are no indicators of changing
access to care or health care coverage, and we were not able
to adjust for this in our analysis.
Although the NEDS database provides nationally repre-
sentative estimates for ED utilization, there are limitations to
thesedata.Becausethisisapubliclyavailable,deidentifieddata
set, validation by medical records review of HZ cases identi-
fied by ICD-9-CM codes was not possible. However, prior stud-
ies have found that the algorithm used in the present study de-
tected HZ with a positive predictive value of 85% or more.13-15
In addition, because our study was limited to ED visits, the re-
sults may not be generalizable to the outpatient setting.
Our findings should be corroborated in other data sets, es-
pecially those including outpatient visits for HZ, that allow for
evaluation of the impact of patient characteristics and valida-
tion of our findings in other settings outside of the ED.
Conclusions
Our study found an increase in total ED visits associated with
HZ between 2006 and 2013 due to an increased number of vis-
its by patients aged 20 to 59 years. Despite decreased utiliza-
tion in patients aged less than 20 years and 60 years or older,
we found increased total adjusted charges in these popula-
tions. Our findings suggest that vaccination may be associ-
ated with a reduction of ED utilization. Further research is nec-
essary to identify the drivers of increased costs.

ErnestBesnier,adermatologistandDirectoroftheHôpitalSaint-Louisin
Paris, who recognized that the injury resembled x-ray dermatitis. Realiz-
ing the potential medical applications of radium, Besnier convinced the
Curies to lend a sample of radium to his colleague, Henri Danlos. In 1901,
Danlossuccessfullytreatedlupuserythematosusandlupusvulgariswith

Unfortunately,theseearlysuccesses,inconjunctionwithanunregu-

ing salesmen. Radium began to be added to many consumer products,
includingtoothpasteandtonics(Radithor).Theseproductsrangedfrom
merely ineffective to catastrophically harmful. One of the most notable
victims was American golf champion and industrialist Eben Byers, who
died in 1932 after consuming large doses of Radithor for several years.
Because Byers had experienced severe osteolysis, The Wall Street Jour-
nal’
s article describing the incident was entitled “The radium water
worked fine, until his jaw came off.”
