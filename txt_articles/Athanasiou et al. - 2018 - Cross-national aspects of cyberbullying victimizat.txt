Abstract
Background: The increasing use of the Internet and social network sites (SNS) has created a new domain of socio-
emotional development for adolescents. The aim of this cross-sectional study was to explore cybervictimization across
seven European countries, in relation to socio-demographic, Internet use and psychosocial variables.
Methods: A cross-sectional school-based study was conducted in the participating countries: Germany, Greece, Iceland
the Netherlands, Poland, Romania and Spain. Anonymous self-completed questionnaires included sociodemographic
data, internet usage characteristics, school achievement, parental control, the Internet Addiction Test and Achenbach’s
Youth Self-Report.
Results: The highest rate of cyber victimization was found in Romania (37.3%) and the lowest in Spain (13.3%). Multiple
logistic regression analyses gave differing results between countries. In Romania, Poland and Germany cyberbullying
victimization was associated with SNS use, whereas Internet use was associated with increased odds of cybervictimization
only in Romania. Cybervictimization was associated with greater internalizing behavior problems in all countries analysed,
and with externalizing problems in all except Romania.
Conclusions: Cyberbullying victimization is an on-going problem, which is subject to country-specific socio-demographic
factors and diverse patterns of current Internet use and its development. Preventive measures should emphasize the
integration of Internet communication technology education in educational contexts, and focus on the consistent
association between cybervictimization and internalizing and externalizing difficulties.
Keywords: Cyberbullying, Cybervictims, Adolescents, Cross-cultural differences
Background
The increased use of the Internet and contemporary
technological devices as primary means of adolescent
socialization has become a major issue of concern. Al-
though Internet technology promotes socialization with
peers through increasing opportunities for communication,
its use has been linked to an array of online risks, including
cyberbullying victimization [1, 2]. Specifically, ownership of
a social network site (SNS) profile has been associated with
higher incidences of cyberbullying [3] and cybervictimiza-
tion [4, 5], especially in relation to the surge in the use of
mobile phones for continual SNS access [6, 7].
Definition and prevalence of Cybervictimization
“Cyberbullying” is used here to describe intentional ag-
gressive behaviors with the purpose of hurting the vic-
tim, distinguished from traditional bullying in that it
occurs through technological means (Internet and SNS)
[8, 9]. Another element of this definition is that it can be
repetitive and ongoing [8, 9], and may incorporate the
component of defenselessness on the part of the victim

 [7]. Cyberbullying covers various acts, such as sending
aggressive and threatening messages, social exclusion,
spreading rumors and online identity theft [8–10]. A
prominent example is the use of SNS to publish private,
inappropriate or humiliating information [1, 10].
The prevalence of cyberbullying varies according to
the operational definition employed and the age group
under study. Reviews suggest that cyber victimization
ranges from 6.5 to 72% worldwide [7–9, 11]. In Europe,
rates of cyberbullying vary substantially between studies
[12–14]. Ortega and colleagues [12] and Genta and col-
leagues [13] using the same sample from the DAPHNE
II program compared emotional reactions and cyberbul-
lying involvement rates between Spain, the United King-
dom and Italy, obtaining rates of 6.2, 4 and 5.4%,
respectively. The “EU Kids Online” study of over 25,000
children between the ages of 9 and 16 reported preva-
lence of cybervictimization ranging between 2 and 14%,
lowest in Italy and Portugal and highest in Estonia and
Romania [14, 15]. The “Net Children Go Mobile” project
found higher rates, increasing from 7 to 12% from 2010
to 2014 [16]. National studies in individual European
countries have found rates of cyberbullying victimization
from 5.5 to 44% [12, 17–25].
Association with psychosocial characteristics
Victims of cyberbullying report an array of psychopatho-
logical symptoms, including internalizing problems [26, 27]
such as feelings of loneliness, depression [28] and lack of
self-esteem [10, 29]. Tsitsika and colleagues [27] indicated
that cyberbullying has a consistent effect on psychosocial
wellbeing in all countries studied, although varying in mag-
nitude. Moreover, it has been related to social anxiety and
isolation [11, 30], as well as to externalizing problems [27],
illicit drug use and conduct problems [7, 8, 31].
Risk factors for cyberbullying
Socio-demographic risk factors and cultural differences
Gender and age are the most prominent of the few
socio-demographic variables that have been studied as
potential
risk
factors
associated
with
cyberbullying
victimization, with rather inconsistent results [9, 32].
Whereas the literature on traditional bullying regards fe-
males as greater victims of relational aggression, no such
association has been clearly established in cyberbullying
research [3, 7, 8, 13, 24, 29, 33]. Some studies have de-
tected an inverse relationship between age and cyberbul-
lying victimization [24, 34], possibly due to the greater
impulsivity of younger individuals and their increased
likelihood of using SNS to meet new people [10], as well
as a peak of cybervictimization amongst younger adoles-
cents [24, 34]. Higher rates of cyberbullying have been
reported among those whose parents’ educational level
was low or middle compared to high [27]. Finally, family
relationships and family structure (e.g. single-parent
family), as the key factors in an adolescent’s “micro” de-
velopmental context, may be related to experiencing
cybervictimization as they influence family cohesion (i.e.
“emotional bonding” between family members), and the
provision of support and engagement in shared activities
between parents and adolescents [35]. Absence of family
communication seems to be associated with an inability
of cybervictims to open up about their experience to
their parents [35–39].
Internet use and SNS variables
Communication with parents, including parental moni-
toring of Internet use, has been repeatedly studied in as-
sociation
with
cyberbullying
[4,
14,
35,
39–41].
Restrictive mediation (control of time spent online, con-
tent filtering and monitoring) seems to be resented by
adolescents [35, 42, 43]. However, active mediation is
considered protective not only in increasing safety but
also in buffering negative psychological impacts on the
victim, by increasing the likelihood of their confiding in
their parents in the event of victimization [4, 36]. “EU
Kids Online” appears to be the only cross-national study
that has investigated parental monitoring in relation to
cyberbullying, finding it to be a protective factor for on-
line risks [14, 44]. Regarding the extent of adolescent
Internet and SNS use, higher levels have been associated
with increased risk of cybervictimization [4].
Theoretical framework and hypothesis
A child’s social environment plays a fundamental role in
determining the level of risks online, including cybervic-
timization [14, 16, 45]. A bio-ecological view of human
development posits that a child’s online experience is
shaped by multiple layers of interacting environmental
systems [16, 46, 47]. Using a child-centered perspective
[14] in the study of these systems requires the explor-
ation of “within-person competencies”, “interpersonal
variables”
(family
and
peers)
and
“extra-personal”
context-dependent variables (social and cultural) in
order to account for risk and protective factors that may
correlate with cybervictimization, [16, 45, 48]. A con-
textual and comparative approach may allow an under-
standing of how national and cultural characteristics
affect a child’s Internet use on a continuum of different
levels of directedness.
The abovementioned prevailing social and cultural
structures seem to have a profound effect on the
phenomenon of cyberbullying in adolescence, but have
not yet been analyzed in terms of country-specific differ-
ences [3, 13]. Past literature has extensively discussed psy-
chological profiles of bullies and victims, and compared
cross-national prevalence rates, but little is known about
the factors associated with the likelihood of cyberbullying

 victimization in different European countries. It is clear
that countries have experienced diverse rhythms in the de-
velopment and integration of information communication
technologies (ICT), and along with social and cultural dif-
ferences across nations it is likely that the factors related
to cybervictimization are not consistent throughout Eur-
ope. For this purpose, the present study within the context
of the EU.NET.ADB project [48] aimed to compare pat-
terns of cyberbullying victimization across seven European
countries. An exploratory goal unique to this study was to
identify differences in demographic (gender, age, parental
educational level, age of first contact with Internet) and
family factors (family structure, parental mediation) that
increase the odds of the occurrence of online victimization
in the countries studied. It was hypothesized that daily use
of SNS and the Internet would increase odds of cybervicti-
mization cross-nationally, in line with the hypothesis that
increased usage is associated with increased online risks
[14, 35]. Following previous research noting the emotional
impact of cyberbullying [14, 27], it was expected that in-
ternalizing and externalizing difficulties would increase
the odds of cybervictimization across countries.
Methods
Procedure and participants
This cross-sectional, quantitative, school-based study
was performed in the context of the EU.NET.ADB
protocol [48], in seven European countries (Germany,
Greece, Iceland, the Netherlands, Poland, Romania,
Spain), during the school year 2011–2012. The study
and its methods received ethical approval according to
the requirements of each participating country [48]. A
common research protocol was employed by all coun-
tries. A random clustered probability sample of adoles-
cents attending school in the 9th and 10th grades was
drawn in each country. The primary sampling unit
(PSU) was the school class and official national lists were
used as sampling frames, stratified according to region
(using the European Union NUTS system or other ap-
propriate national regional classification) and population
density. A random sample of about 100 classes was
drawn in each country in order to achieve a target sam-
ple size of 2000 adolescents. These classes were selected
by systematic sampling from the list commencing from
a random starting point. In case of non-class-based edu-
cational systems, clusters were formed in line with
current school structure, and a similar sampling proced-
ure was followed [48]. In the absence of a list, classes
were selected with probability proportional to size.
These procedures resulted in the selection of individual
adolescents with equal probabilities.
All students registered in the selected classes were eli-
gible for participation. All participants were required to
provide parental informed consent; forms that emphasized
the confidentiality and anonymity of the study were pro-
vided to their legal guardians prior to the execution of the
study. Students attending class on the day of data collection
completed anonymously a paper-and-pencil self-report
questionnaire administered by a trained researcher in one
school hour. The anonymous and confidential nature of the
study was stressed. Further details of methodology can be
found in the EU.NET.ADB project report [48].
The questionnaire was completed by 13,708 adoles-
cents. Approximately 10% of registered students were
absent on the day of data collection and 3% of those
present either refused to participate or did not have the
necessary permission. The response rate, as a percentage
of registered students, was very high in all countries
(from 95.0% in Spain to 86.7% in Romania) except
Iceland (62.9%). Of those who completed the question-
naire, 129 who fell outside the 14–17 years age range
and 295 who did not state their age or gender were elim-
inated. Of the remaining 13,284, 912 (6.9%) did not an-
swer the question about cyberbullying. This left a total
sample of 12,372 14–17-year-olds available for the
present analysis.
Materials
Socio-demographic characteristics
The socio-demographic variables that were investigated
for associations with the experience of cyberbullying
were age, gender, parental educational level (low/middle
vs. high) and parental marital status (married/living to-
gether vs. separated/divorced/single-parent family). Par-
ental educational level, which served as proxy for social
class, was defined as the higher of the levels achieved by
the two parents. Among Internet-related behaviors, par-
ticipants were asked about their age at starting use of
new technologies, daily amount of SNS use, parents’ per-
mission for content visited on the Internet (adolescent’s
agreement with the statement “My parents allow me to
visit every website that I want”) and parental control of
time spent online (response to the question “How often
do your parents say that you are only allowed to go on
the Internet until a certain time?”). Adolescents were
asked to report their SNS and Internet use on a typical
day in the past 12 months, with responses ranging from
“not at all” to “more than 4 hours.” The weighted aver-
age of use during weekdays and weekends provided a
single weekly estimate, which was dichotomized at the
median into moderate SNS use (< 2 h daily) and heavier
SNS use (> 2 h daily) [27].
Cyberbullying victimization
The following detailed, yet simply phrased, introductory
definition and examples of bullying behaviors online were
provided in the questionnaire, with emphasis on the ele-
ments of hostility or hurtfulness, the repetitiveness of the

 event and the use of the Internet as the medium of choice
[27]: “Sometimes children or teenagers can do hurtful or
nasty things to someone and this can often be quite a few
times on different days over a period of time, for example.
This can include: teasing someone in a way this person
does not like; spreading false/malicious rumors; sending
someone mean or threatening messages; systematically ex-
cluding, ignoring, and isolating. When people are hurtful
or nasty to someone in this way, it can happen on the
Internet (e-mail, instant messaging, social networking,
chat rooms)”. This comprehensive description was chosen
instead of using the term “cyberbullying” due to the po-
tential perceived ambiguity regarding the behaviors it en-
compasses and the absence of equivalent translations in
some countries [27, 49]. Subsequently participants were
asked the following question: “Has someone acted in this
kind of hurtful or nasty way to you in the past 12 months
on the Internet?” with possible responses being “no”, “yes”
and “do not know/prefer not to say”. This question was
adapted from the “EU Kids Online” study [14] due to its
cultural adaptation and translation of high quality [48],
and was partly in line with Olweus’ Bully/Victim question-
naire [27, 48].
Psychosocial wellbeing
Psychosocial wellbeing was measured using the Youth
Self-Report (YSR) [50]. The YSR is an instrument measur-
ing adolescent competence and problems in social, aca-
demic, cognitive, internalizing and externalizing behaviors
[50]. It had already been translated and standardized in all
participating countries, and is known to present excellent
psychometric
properties
and
suitability
for
use
in
cross-national research [51, 52]. This instrument was not
employed in the German arm of the study.
Data analysis
Variables pertaining to the socio-demographic and Inter-
net use related variables were expressed as absolute and
relative frequencies. Multiple logistic regression analysis
was used in order to find factors independently associ-
ated with the likelihood of cyberbullying separately in
each country. Adjusted odds ratios with 95% confidence
intervals were computed from the results of the logistic
regression analyses. All p-values reported are two-tailed.
All statistical tests, standard errors and confidence inter-
vals were corrected for the complex sample design with
countries as strata and classes as clusters, using the
Complex Samples procedure of SPSS statistical software
(version 19.0).
Results
Sample characteristics are shown in Table 1. From the
total sample, 46.8% of the participants were male and
38.4% aged from 16 to 17.9 years. Parental educational
level was high in 62.8% of the participants and in most
cases (80.1%) parents were married or lived together.
Daily use of SNS for more than two hours was reported
by 36.4% of the adolescents and daily Internet use for
more than two hours was reported by 51.0%. In most

Figure 1 presents the proportion of youth that has
been bullied online in past 12 months, by country. The
highest rates occurred in Romania (37.3%), Greece
(26.8%) and Germany (24.3%), following by Poland
(21.5%). The lowest rates were found in the Netherlands,
Iceland and Spain (see Fig. 1). Table 2 shows the rate of
cyberbullying within each category of the sociodemo-
graphic and Internet-related variables studied, separately
in each country. The crude odds ratios computed from
these data are shown in Tables 3 and 4, which also present
the adjusted odds ratios from the multiple logistic regres-
sion analyses with cyberbullying victimization as the
dependent variable. Among the socio-demographic and
Internet-related variables studied, parental education level
and age at first Internet use were not independently asso-
ciated (at p = 0.05) with cyberbullying victimization in any
of the countries. Increased Internalizing and Externalizing
Problems were associated with greater odds of cybervicti-
mization everywhere (Table 3), except for Externalizing
problems in Romania. Additionally in Romania, adoles-
cents over 16 years old had 48% lower odds of being a vic-
tim of cyberbullying compared to younger adolescents,
and daily use of SNS and the Internet for more than two
hours was associated in Romania with 83 and 57% greater
probability for victimization, respectively. In Poland, daily
use of SNS for more than two hours was associated with
53% greater odds of cyberbullying victimization in the past
twelve months, and the odds of being bullied online also
increased when parents aimed at controlling the time of
Internet use sometimes (49% greater odds) or very fre-
quently (63%) (Table 3).
Multiple logistic regression analysis for cyberbullying
victimization in Germany (Table 4) indicated that daily
use of SNS for more than two hours was independently
associated with cyberbullying victimization, increasing
the odds of its occurrence by 66%. In the Netherlands,
males had only half the odds of having been a victim of
cyberbullying compared to females, while in Iceland the
odds of cyberbullying were 59% higher in adolescents
whose parents had high educational level (Table 4).
Discussion
The present study investigated cyber victimization in ado-
lescents from seven European countries. Previous research
has focused primarily on cyberbullying victimization
prevalence rates and related psychopathological symptoms
[6, 11, 12, 30, 31, 53]. Consequently, the present study is
novel in comparing individual factors associated with
cyberbullying victimization, namely socio-demographic,
Internet use and psychosocial variables, between countries.
On the whole, the pattern of victimization rates across
countries is consistent with the “EU Kids Online” study
[14], with the exception of Greece which held a higher
ranking by percentage of adolescents victimized. However,
the current study found overall higher rates of cybervicti-
mization compared to EU Kids Online, ranging from 13.3
to 37.3%.
The relatively high percentages recorded in the present
study may reflect a growing temporal trend, but could
also be influenced by differences in the ages of partici-
pants between studies. The “EU Kids Online” sample
consisted of 9–16-year-old adolescents, whereas the
EU.NET.ADB study included adolescents aged from 14
to 17 - a population much more likely to use the Inter-
net and SNS actively and more frequently, and in which
ICT knowledge is often accompanied by a tendency for
online bullying of peers [6]. Furthermore, data collection
procedures differed between the two studies.
Results and differences by country
Romania
Romania presented the highest rates of cyberbullying,
supporting
previous
literature
that
has
consistently
ranked it highest in its rate of cybervictimization along
with other Eastern European countries [6, 14]. The per-
centage of Romanian adolescents bullied online was
much greater than that reported in the “EU Kids Online”
study [14]. Romania has seen a sharp increase in Internet
and SNS use in recent years; underestimation of risks by
parents, and absence of parental digital skills may have
contributed to the emergence of high rates of cyberbully-
ing victimization [44]. This sudden rise in Internet use,
compared to the steadier and much earlier growth of
Internet use in the other European countries studied [44],
leaves a large technological gap between parents and the
younger generation. Moreover, the absence of a legislative
framework for the protection of Romanian children on-
line, as well as the current lack of integration of ICT com-
ponents into education, limits the promotion of online
safety and awareness of online risks [54].
Geece
Greece was the only country that deviated from the pat-
tern established by the “EU Kids Online” study [14] and
other national studies [20, 21, 25], presenting higher
rates of cybervictimization compared to previous studies
[9]. While Greece has made several efforts regarding
promoting online safety, the very rapid diffusion of
Internet technologies has reached many adolescents who
lack digital skills and awareness of online risks. In par-
ticular, 38% of adolescents leave their Facebook profile
public [44]. However, this growing pattern, along with
internalizing and externalizing problems arising as the
only associated factors, may reflect the deeply rooted
Athanasiou et al. BMC Public Health  (2018) 18:800 
Page 5 of 15
 contemporary problems Greece is facing, which have af-
fected adolescents on a national and societal level [55].
The socioeconomic crisis has influenced adolescent de-
velopment in emotional and social domains, influencing
both their own behavior but also the interacting levels of
their socio-emotional development; it has affected the
way they cope with their everyday concerns and their
family’s financial limitations [56], making them more
prone to violence [55], and influencing their sensitivity
to stressors, one of which could be online victimization.
Poland
The percentage of adolescents that had experienced
cyberbullying in Poland was similar to rates reported
elsewhere in Europe [9]. In contrast to Romania and
Greece, Poland has enforced legislation targeting cyber-
bullying as a form of emotional violence and has in-
cluded ICT literacy in the primary and secondary school
curricula [57]. All the same, rates of cyberbullying
victimization in this study were greater than those re-
ported in the “EU Kids Online” study [14]. Furthermore,
in Poland, attempts at parental control of time spent on-
line were established as an individual factor significantly
associated with cyberbullying victimization, supporting
previous research that has repeatedly associated it with
cyberbullying [4, 40, 41]. These results are in contrast
with the “EU Kids Online” study, which reported that
74% of children have a positive attitude towards parental
mediation - which tends to be of a restrictive nature –
based, however, on an overall younger sample [44].
Gemany
In the present study rates of cyber victimization in
Germany were higher than in past national studies and
European research programs, with the exception of a
study conducted by Katzer and colleagues [22] on chat
room victimization. Specifically, Riebel and colleagues
[23] found an overall cyberbullying victimization rate of
14.1%. The “EU Kids Online” study estimated cyberbul-
lying among German children and adolescents at 5%
[14]. In contrast to Romania and Greece, Germany has
made substantial efforts to promote online safety, both
through the “Internet and Digital Society Committee of
Inquiry” and individual states, including the “Medienpass
(media passport) NRW” program, an attempt to improve
education on digital skills by offering advice and guid-
ance [58].
Te Netherlands
The Netherlands emerged as one of the countries with
the lowest rates of cybervictimization, although the rate
was higher than the 4% reported for Dutch children in
the “EU Kids Online” study [14]. According to a qualita-
tive study conducted in the Netherlands by Jacobs and
colleagues [59], cyber-bullies are judged as “cowards” by
their peers and are heavily criticized amongst young stu-
dents, which may account for the low rates reported.
Furthermore, the Netherlands has previously been re-
ported as a country with considerable levels of ICT liter-
acy that were established as early as 2004, allowing for
the integration of digital skills into education and the
use of active parental monitoring that may contribute to
the lower rates observed [44].
Iceland
In Iceland, the low rates of cyberbullying victimization
are difficult to compare, because findings establishing
national rates are scarce. Higher educational level was
associated with increased odds of cybervictimization.
This may be explained by the greater use and potentially

 increased access to electronic equipment by adolescents
who are in better socioeconomic circumstances [14].
However, it also suggests that educational attainment is
not necessarily related to parental digital skills which
may contribute to adolescent’s safer use of Internet
technologies.
Spain
The present study found a higher probability of adoles-
cents in Spain being cyber-bullied than in a number of
previous Spanish national studies, which obtained esti-
mates
of
5.5
to
9.3%
[53],
and
in
European
cross-national studies [13, 14]. However, the rate was
lower than in one study conducted by Buelga and col-
leagues [60], who reported rates of 29% for Internet
victimization in the past 12 months. The identification
of internalizing and externalizing problems as main risk
factors demonstrates that socio-emotional and behav-
ioral traits of victims [31, 53] are associated with the ex-
perience of cyberbullying. Regarding gender, our findings
conflict with some Spanish studies that highlighted the
greater rates of victimization among females [13, 53],
but support research that found low predictive power of
gender and age in predicting cyberbullying [32].
Cybervictimization in relation to socio-demographic
characteristics
Although previous studies compared gender and age in
relation to the occurrence of different types of cyberbul-
lying [6, 13], the present study’s novelty is rooted in its
comparative approach to establishing socio-demographic
risk factors cross-nationally in this age group. Regarding
gender differences, results from the majority of countries
are in agreement with previous literature that did not
find gender to be statistically significantly associated
with cyberbullying [7–9, 14], demonstrating that in
terms of victimization (not necessarily perpetration) girls
and boys can equally be recipients of relational aggres-
sion online. Consequently, it is imperative to develop
prevention measures that acknowledge members of ei-
ther gender as potential victims of bullying online.
In the Netherlands, however, girls were twice as likely
to experience cyberbullying compared to boys, in line
with past research that established greater cyberbullying
victimization prevalence in girls than boys [3, 14]. This
result may be to some extent attributed to the definition
employed and the perception of Dutch adolescents, and
suggests
a
limitation
of
the
operational
definition
employed; specifically, it has been reported that girls in
the Netherlands experience online victimization as more
negative than boys and older students [44]. Conse-
quently, the use of the terms “hurtful” and “nasty” in the
operationalization of cyberbullying may account for the
higher odds of female victimization in the Netherlands.
Finally, age arose as a risk factor of cyber victimization
only in Romania [27], reflecting the inconsistent results
obtained in the literature [8, 22, 24, 34]. Since this finding
was only established in Romania, it is worth considering
these results in light of SNS and Internet usage being as-
sociated with cyberbullying victimization, possibly sug-
gesting that absence of computer literacy over safety
issues in younger adolescents in Romania may play an im-
portant role in their risk of victimization. Future research
should thus be directed at observing patterns and means
of cyberbullying victimization in relation to age.
Association with psychosocial characteristics
Going beyond previous studies merely reporting the
prevalence of cybervictimization, we carried out regres-
sion analyses relating cybervictimization to the adoles-
cent’s psychosocial characteristics. Internalizing problems
increased the odds of having experienced cyberbullying in
all countries analysed. These results correspond to previ-
ous findings that associated cybervictimization with lower
self-esteem [22], suicidal ideation [26], social anxiety and
depression [53]. This consistent association demonstrates
that adolescents who internalize their problems are at
greater risk of experiencing cyberbullying [6, 9], a relation-
ship that is likely to be bidirectional in nature. On the one
hand, adolescents who experience internalizing difficulties
may have a greater likelihood of perceiving a behavior as
hurtful, but may also manifest such negative feelings in re-
sponse to the aggressive behavior. In addition, in the
present study, externalizing problems increased the odds
of online victimization in Greece, Spain, Poland, the
Netherlands and Iceland, consistent with previous litera-
ture that establishes a connection between externalizing
behavior and cyberbullying victimization [7, 8, 13, 27].
Internet use and SNS variables
Although Internet use for more than 2 h a day arose as a
risk factor for cyberbullying only in Romania, the odds for
having experienced cyberbullying increased when SNS
were used for more than 2 h a day in Romania, Germany
and Poland. This is an important finding, challenging past
research that postulates that ownership, rather than use of
an SNS profile, increases the risk of cybervictimization [5].
Spending a greater amount of time online, and specifically
on SNS, is consistently associated with cyberbullying, pos-
sibly due to the increased posting of private information
and meeting strangers online [5]. Furthermore, if social
media are used as a means of communication within the
context of relationships, they also become a vehicle for
problem solving and the expression of relational aggres-
sion [4]. Either way, increased SNS use places adolescents
at greater risk of cyberbullying [14]. Most importantly, the
statistical significance of SNS in increasing cyberbullying
victimization probability occurred in countries with high
Athanasiou et al. BMC Public Health  (2018) 18:800 
Page 12 of 15
 rates of cyberbullying, but not in countries with lower
rates, despite the high use of SNS in countries such as the
Netherlands and Spain [44].
Strengths and limitations
The primary strength of the present study lies in its novelty
in providing estimates of cyberbullying victimization across
seven European countries in this specific age group. Fur-
thermore, this study identifies factors that increase the
odds of the occurrence of online victimization, including
demographic, socio-economic and psychosocial character-
istics. The large representative samples and anonymous
self-reporting have substantially restricted the potential for
biases. However, this study also has certain limitations.
Specifically, its cross-sectional nature limits our under-
standing of the direct causes of cyberbullying victimization,
and self-reports may introduce bias if there is an element
of social desirability in responding. Furthermore, five years
have passed since the study was conducted, thus limiting
the extent to which it represents the current picture of
cybervictimization, bearing in mind the rapid technological
developments in Internet, and especially mobile, technolo-
gies. Finally, in common with almost all school-based stud-
ies, data were collected from only those students who were
present on the day of data collection.
Conclusion
The present study has mapped out a number of factors that
are associated with cyberbullying victimization in seven
European countries, pinpointing important social differ-
ences that may affect the prevalence of this phenomenon.
These findings have important implications for both clinical
and educational settings: the psychosocial impact of cyber-
bullying needs to be acknowledged and dealt with, as it is
related to distress and psychopathological symptoms. The
absence of studies that could explain different rates of
cybervictimization between countries limits our ability to
account for the present findings, but also indicates that this
field has substantial potential for exploration. Educational
settings would benefit from integrating ICT education into
their curricula, especially in countries where use of the
Internet has risen abruptly. Future research would gain
from
studying
cyberbullying
victimization
from
a
socio-ecological perspective, to better establish the relation-
ship of societal norms and macro changes in Internet use
behavior to the expression of violence amongst adolescents.
