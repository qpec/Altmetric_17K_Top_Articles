Abstract
Sequencing of the human genome and decades of genetic association and linkage studies
have dramatically improved our understanding of the etiology of many diseases. However,
the multiple causes of complex diseases are still not well understood, in part because
genetic and sociocultural risk factors are not typically investigated concurrently. Hyperten-
sion is a leading risk factor for cardiovascular disease and afflicts more African Americans
than any other racially defined group in the US. Few genetic loci for hypertension have been
replicated across populations, which may reflect population-specific differences in genetic
variants and/or inattention to relevant sociocultural factors. Discrimination is a salient socio-
cultural risk factor for poor health and has been associated with hypertension. Here we use
a biocultural approach to study blood pressure (BP) variation in African Americans living in
Tallahassee, Florida by genotyping over 30,000 single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs)
and capturing experiences of discrimination using novel measures of unfair treatment of self
and others (n = 157). We perform a joint admixture and genetic association analysis for BP
that prioritizes regions of the genome with African ancestry. We only report significant SNPs
that were confirmed through our simulation analyses, which were performed to determine
the false positive rate. We identify eight significant SNPs in five genes that were previously
associated with cardiovascular diseases. When we include measures of unfair treatment
and test for interactions between SNPs and unfair treatment, we identify a new class of
genes involved in multiple phenotypes including psychosocial distress and mood disorders.
Our results suggest that inclusion of culturally relevant stress measures, like unfair treat-
ment in African Americans, may reveal new genes and biological pathways relevant to the
etiology of hypertension, and may also improve our understanding of the complexity of
gene-environment interactions that underlie complex diseases.

 Introduction
African Americans bear a disproportionate burden of ill health in the United States (US) [1]
with cardiovascular disease being the leading contributor to reduced life expectancy. Hyper-
tension is a leading risk factor of cardiovascular disease and afflicts more African Americans
than any other racially defined group in the US [2]. The high prevalence and premature onset
of hypertension in African Americans is a major public health concern [3].
The high estimated heritability of blood pressure (BP) has [4] prompted extensive efforts to
identify the genetic underpinnings of BP variation [5]. However, traditional genetic methods
such as genome-wide association studies (GWASs) and admixture mapping have largely failed
to identify replicable loci that associate with BP across populations [6–10]. Out of the two
GWASs for BP performed in African Americans [8, 9], no replicable loci reached genome-
wide significance. Some studies identified a positive relationship between African ancestry and
BP [11, 12], while others failed to find any significant relationship [13, 14]. The lack of replica-
tion of genetic loci associated with BP across populations of different ancestries has generally
been attributed to population-specific genetic variants, variation in allele frequencies, different
patterns of linkage disequilibrium (LD) across populations or low statistical power due to lim-
ited sample size, particularly in African-Americans [15].
While it is true that population-specific variants, allele frequencies, and LD exist, it’s not
clear that these differences account for the lack of replication across studies. In fact, epidemio-
logical evidence suggests that environmental factors contribute more to phenotypic variation
in BP than do genetics [16, 17]. BP levels vary widely across populations, with the prevalence
of hypertension lowest in populations with low levels of environmental and psychological
stress and extensive genetic variability [18], suggesting that the major determinants of high BP
are likely to be a constellation of sociocultural factors, with genetic determination being lim-
ited to variation within populations and to interactions with the environment [18].
Sociocultural factors [19–24] are important determinants of hypertension, and discrimina-
tion is a salient risk factor for poor health [25]. Some researchers propose that discrimination
may contribute to the health disparities observed in African Americans [19] since discrimina-
tion has been associated with many health issues, including BP in African Americans [26–28].
Most existing studies measure perceived discrimination only by reference to participants’ per-
sonal exposure to unfair treatment. However, we have shown that unfair treatment experienced
by individuals close to the study participant—family or friends—is an important stressor [29].
Multiple studies have discussed the “missing heritability” of complex phenotypes, i.e. the
discrepancy between the estimated heritability of a phenotype and the total variation explained
by specific genetic variants [30–32]. The missing heritability of complex disease may partially
be due to the lack of inclusion of environmental stressors in standard genetic association stud-
ies [33]. The definition of heritability is often equated with the genetic contribution to pheno-
typic variation, but it actually refers to the ratio of genetic to total phenotypic variance in a
population [34]. Phenotypic variance includes genetic and environmental variation as well as a
covariance term between the two, but many genetic studies assume this covariance term to be
zero. If the covariance is not zero or if there are gene-environment interactions, then standard
genetic association studies that do not include relevant environmental factors may miss impor-
tant associations. With a few exceptions [20, 29, 35], research into the stressors associated with
BP seldom includes both genetic and sociocultural data, such that few studies are able to evalu-
ate interactions.
Here we conduct a biocultural investigation of BP among 157 African Americans living in
Tallahassee, Florida (USA). We use a Bayesian joint admixture and association method that
prioritizes regions of the genome with African ancestry [36] and improves on other methods

 [36–38] by taking advantage of the reduced testing burden of admixture mapping relative to
association mapping. We adapt this method to include both genetic and sociocultural data,
and interaction effects, to test for association with BP. We performed simulation analyses to
assess the statistical significance of our associations. We assay over 30,000 genetic markers
[ancestry informative markers (AIMs) and SNPs in genes associated with hypertension, car-
diovascular disease, and stress] and include new measures of unfair treatment in order to
develop an expanded picture of risk factors underlying BP variation.
Results
Study sample characteristics
Sample characteristics for the 157 African American participants are detailed in Table 1. There
were statistically significant differences in sex, age, BMI, SBP, and DBP readings between those
individuals taking and not taking antihypertensive medications.
Variable selection for inclusion in BP models
In our sample, age, sex, and BMI were associated with SBP (S1 Table). Unfair treatment vari-
ables were not associated with BP in simple linear regression analysis. Based on these results,
as well as potential confounders previously identified in the literature [39] and inclusion of our
new measures of unfair treatment, we included the following variables in our models of
adjusted BP: age, sex, BMI, education, African ancestry, unfair treatment and PC-AiRs.
Strategy for genetic analyses
We analyzed SBP and DBP measurements separately since the underlying genetic susceptibil-
ity of hypertension may be different for elevated SBP and DBP. Three main genetic analyses
were performed (Fig 1). We first performed standard admixture mapping using a frequentist
approach by linearly regressing blood pressure on local ancestry, adjusted for global ancestry,

 sex, age, education, BMI and relatedness (Fig 1A). We next performed standard genetic associ-
ation analysis for blood pressure using a frequentist approach by linearly regressing blood
pressure on SNP genotype, adjusted for global ancestry, sex, age, education, BMI, and related-
ness (Fig 1B). Finally, we used joint admixture and association mapping with partial Bonfer-
roni correction [36] to identify SNPs that were associated with BP using a Bayesian approach
where we set the posterior probabilities from admixture mapping as the prior probabilities for
association mapping. Three progressive joint admixture and association models were per-
formed. Model 1 tested SNP genotype (Fig 1C), Model 2 added measures of unfair treatment
(Fig 1D), and Model 3 tested for an interaction term between SNP genotype and unfair treat-
ment (Fig 1E).
Admixture mapping for blood pressure
Admixture mapping (illustrated in Fig 1A) did not detect any genome-wide significant loci
associated with BP after correcting for the average number of admixture switches (p-value less
than or equal to 0.05/78.82 = 6.34x10-4) (S1A and S1B Fig).
Association mapping for blood pressure
Association mapping (illustrated in Fig 1B) did not detect any significant SNPs associated with
BP after Bonferroni correction (p-value less than or equal to 1/27,559 = 3.6 x 10−5) (S1C and
S1D Fig).

 Joint admixture and association mapping for BP
Three progressive joint admixture and association models were performed using a Bayesian
approach (illustrated in Fig 1C–1E); Model 1 tested SNP genotype, Model 2 added measures of
unfair treatment, and Model 3 tested for an interaction term between SNP genotype and unfair
treatment. We performed simulation analyses to assess the statistical significance of our associ-
ations. We randomly re-shuffled the associated BP measures and covariates to the SNP geno-
types and ancestry estimates in our participants 10,000 times and created a distribution of p-
values. This distribution was used to obtain the false positive rate of our associations. We only
report significant SNPs that were confirmed through simulations analyses.
Model 1 joint admixture and association mapping detected eight significant SNPs for SBP
(Fig 2A, Table 2 & S2 Table). Among the significant SNPs identified, SNP rs56766116 is
located in the LRP8 gene, SNPs rs6739240 and rs72783028 are located in the CAPN13 gene,
SNPs rs6791604 and rs2320172 are located in the MITF gene, SNP rs2116737 is located in the
SGCD gene, and SNPs rs80149157 and rs67579183 are located in the MLL3 gene. We detected
three significant associations when testing DBP and all three SNPs (rs77804878, rs114805596,
rs17173425) are located in the MLL3 gene (Fig 2B, Table 3 & S3 Table).
Model 2 builds on Model 1 by including one of two measures of unfair treatment [unfair
treatment of self (UT-Self) and unfair treatment of others (UT-Other)]. When testing SBP, we
detected one significant association when including UT-Self (rs2116737 is located in the SCGD
gene) (Fig 2C, Table 2 & S2 Table) and two significant associations when including UT-Other
(rs115805528 in the MITF gene and rs7962445 in the PRH1-PRR4 gene) (Fig 2E, Table 2 & S2
Table). When testing DBP, we detected eight significant associations when including UT-Self
(rs2597955, rs2600370, rs2600368, rs2708349, rs2600362, rs2597921, rs2416545 located in
PRH1-PRR4 and rs2445762 located in CYP19A1 gene) (Fig 2D, Table 3 & S3 Table) and one
significant associations when including UT-Other (rs1319603 downstream of KCNK2/KCTD3
genes) (Fig 2F, Table 3 & S3 Table).
Model 3 builds on the previous models by testing for interactions between SNP genotype
and unfair treatment associated with BP. Unfair treatment measures were first dichotomized
as No/Yes variables. For SBP, we identified one significant interaction with UT-Self
(rs11190458 in PKD2L1) (Fig 2G, Table 2 & S2 Table) and three significant interactions with
UT-Other (rs35283004 upstream of HTR4 and ADRB2, rs11042725 upstream of SBF2 and
ADM, and rs547330 in ABI3BP) (Fig 2I, Table 2 & S2 Table). For DBP, we detected one signifi-
cant association with UT-Self (rs11190458 in PKD2L1) (Fig 2H, Table 3 & S3 Table). The inter-
actions between SNP genotype and level of unfair treatment associate with a range of BP
readings including increased variation in BP at both low and high levels of unfair treatment
depending on the gene (Fig 3).
We also dichotomized unfair treatment measures as Low/High and identified two signifi-
cant interactions with UT-Other (rs12050767 and rs34712049 in CYP19A1) for SBP (S2A Fig,
Table 2 & S2 Table) and one (rs34712049 in CYP19A1) for DBP (S2D Fig, Table 3 & S3 Table).
Interactions with CYP19A1 appear to be sex dependent, where men show more variation in
BP at high levels of UT-Other dependent on CYP19A1 genotype when compared to women
(S2B, S2C and S2E Fig).
Most of the SNPs we identified to be significantly associated with BP are associated with
genes that have been previously related to cardiovascular phenotypes (with the exception of
PRH1-PRR4 that has no known associations) (Table 4). However, when we test for SNP by
UT-Other interactions, we identify a new class of genes that have been related to psychological
phenotypes, including psychosocial distress and mood disorders (Table 4, in italics).

 rarely both included in genetic association studies. Specifically, the factors that influence BP,
and the role these factors play in racial disparities in hypertension, are under debate. It is
known that genetic susceptibility and exposure to sociocultural risk factors are both associated
with hypertension and other complex diseases. Moreover, sociocultural stressors linked to sys-
temic racism in the US may contribute to the racial disparities [57] seen with hypertension

 and other complex diseases in African Americans. Even with this knowledge, the majority of
genetic studies of complex diseases performed to date include minimal sociocultural data.
Our study indicates that both genetic and sociocultural factors contribute to a comprehen-
sive model of BP variation. Association and admixture analyses by themselves did not detect
any significant SNPs. In contrast, our results from a joint admixture and association study of
BP, tested in three models that sequentially incorporated sociocultural data, did identify signif-
icant associations. In particular, interactions between SNPs and UT-Other revealed a class of
genes implicated in multiple phenotypes including psychosocial distress or mood disorders.

 The eight significant SNPs identified in Model 1 are located in five genes (Fig 2)—LRP8,
CAPN13, MITF, SGCD and MLL3—previously implicated in BP variation or cardiovascular
disease. LRP8 gene has been associated with triglyceride levels, coronary artery disease, and
myocardial infarction [40]. CAPN13 gene was significantly associated with a gene x BMI inter-
action effect for BP among African Americans [41]. MITF stimulates the transcription of
HIF1A [58], which contributes to pulmonary hypertension [42]. SGCD is a risk factor for
hypertrophic cardiomyopathy [43], HDL-cholesterol [44], and coronary spastic angina [45].
The histone methylase MLL3 (associated with SPB and DBP) has been demonstrated to medi-
ate HOXB9 expression with estrogens [46], and HOXB9 regulates renin, an enzyme that influ-
ences BP [59].
In Model 2, we expanded Model 1 to include sociocultural data, specifically measures of
unfair treatment. Model 2 replicated associations at two genes from Model 1 (SGCD and
MITF) and identified a novel locus of unknown function (PRH1-PRR4). A SNP in the
CYP19A1 gene was identified to be associated with DBP when UT-Self was included in Model
2. The CYP19A1 gene converts androgens to estrogens and a significant interaction between
CYP19A1 genotype and sex on cardiovascular outcomes was previously identified [47]. Lastly,
a SNP downstream of the KCNK2 was associated to DBP in Model 2 that included UT-Other.
The KCNK2 gene encodes a K+ channel and has been associated with adrenal aldosterone-pro-
ducing adenomas [50], hereditary hypertension [50], and depressive disorders [48, 49].

 In Model 3, we tested for interactions between SNPs and unfair treatment that were associ-
ated with BP. The “weathering hypothesis” proposes a threshold of cumulative psychosocial
distress over the life course before effects on physical and biological health are observed [60].
We dichotomized the unfair treatment variables in two ways (No/Yes; Low/High) in order to
model different thresholds at which the weathering hypothesis might manifest in our study.
We identified one interaction effect between a SNP in the PKD2L1 gene and UT-Self in associ-
ation with SBP and DBP. PKD2L1 is a non-selective calcium ion regulation channel and has
been associated with metabolites in serum among African Americans [51].
When we tested for interactions between UT-Other and SNPs in association with BP, we
identified six interaction effects in genes that are associated with multiple psychological pheno-
types, including psychosocial distress and mood disorders (Table 4). These effects included an
interaction between UT-Other and a SNP upstream of genes HTR4/ADRB2; HTR4 was previ-
ously associated with schizophrenia and suicide attempts [53], and ADRB2 was associated with
psychological distress [54]. Another interaction was between UT-Other and a SNP upstream
of the SBF2/ADM genes; SBF2 was associated with addiction [55], and ADM was associated
with anxiety [61], depression and bipolar disease [56]. We also found that UT-Other interacts
with a SNP in gene ABI3BP that was previously associated with suicide attempts among
patients with depression [52]. The interaction effects between SNPs and UT on BP are varied
and difficult to explain in detail. However, there is evidence that some SNPs may contribute to
an increase in BP at high levels of UT, e.g. HTR4/ADRB2 A/A homozygotes, while others
appear to be protective at high levels of UT, e.g. PKD2L1 A/A homozygotes. Although not sig-
nificant on its own, UT exposure may be necessary to reveal the SNP effect (protective or oth-
erwise) as is seen in some studies of mental illness in which exposure to early life adversity is
necessary to reveal its interaction with the risk variant, e.g. serotonin transporter SNP,
5-HTTLPR [62].
Finally, we identified interactions between UT-Other and three SNPs in the CYP19A1 gene
located on chromosome 15 to be associated with SBP and DBP. CYP19A1 encodes aromatase,
the enzyme responsible for the conversion of androgens to estrogens, and may play a role in
variation in outcomes among men and women with cardiovascular disease. A significant inter-
action had been previously identified between CYP19A1 SNP genotypes and sex that increased
cardiovascular related mortality in men and decreased cardiovascular related mortality in
women [47]. Based on these results, we tested for a sex effect in the UT-Other�CYP19A1 SNPs
and observed suggestive evidence that the interactions between UT-Other and genotypes of
CYP19A1 SNPs associated with BP are dependent on sex, i.e. BP varies more at high levels of
unfair treatment of others based on CYP19A1 SNP genotypes in men when compared to
women (S3 Fig). If confirmed in future studies, these results suggest that some CYP19A1 vari-
ants may have a protective effect and some may increase vulnerability to hypertension based
on exposure to UT-Other and sex. Furthermore, these results indicate that both genetic and
sociocultural factors contribute to a comprehensive model of BP variation.
The cumulative effect of multiple genetic risk factors and an individual’s susceptibility to
sociocultural stressors is complex. It makes sense that genes involved in mood disorders, such
as depression, suicide and addiction, might be involved in the interactions between stress from
discrimination, genetic risk factors, and BP in African Americans, and that the interactions
might be circular and feedback on each other. For example, chronic illnesses can lead to
depression [63], and recent studies also indicate that depression in otherwise healthy people
may increase their risk of developing heart disease [64]. Furthermore, chronic exposure to
stress (such as discrimination) or the stress of poor health may be a risk factor for depression.
Finally, a single genetic risk factor may be associated with multiple complex diseases. Since we
used a cross-sectional design, it is not possible to disentangle the causal relationship between

 stress, disease, genetic risk factors and BP in our study. However, we can speculate on scenar-
ios in which these factors may interact to influence health. Everyday encounters with discrimi-
nation are causally associated with poor mental health outcomes in African Americans [65],
which could then lead to the development of increased BP. The extent to which the experience
of systemic racism is unique to African Americans may help explain the racial disparities seen
in hypertension, and possibly other complex diseases.
We find evidence that UT-Other is a salient risk factor for BP in our study population.
Furthermore, UT-Other reveals novel biological processes involved in hypertension and
possibly involved in racial health disparities. There are several reasons why experiences with
UT-Other and UT-Self may differ in their effect on blood pressure. As we previously
described [29], UT-Self neglects social and cultural context and may be biased by partici-
pants’ reluctance to report personal experiences of unfair treatment. Denying that one has
experienced discrimination could itself be a coping strategy to avoid stigma, and the physio-
logical consequences of this strategy are unclear. Furthermore, people may feel greater dis-
tress from hearing about bad experiences of people close to them over which they have little
control. It is also possible that hearing about friends’, family members’, or coworkers’ expe-
riences of unfair treatment may prime people to anticipate the same experience in similar
social settings. The resulting state of hypervigilance may be uniquely associated with ele-
vated risk of hypertension in African Americans [66]. Regardless, the key consideration is
that a physiological stress response can arise without direct experience of the stressor, i.e.
the stress response can be activated by observing an individual experience a stressful situa-
tion [67]. We are most likely under-estimating the stress associated with unfair treatment
since we do not capture less proximate experiences such as those reported in the news and
social media, including shootings of unarmed black men and women, which clearly contrib-
ute to African American distress.
Multiple studies have discussed the “missing heritability” of complex phenotypes [30–32].
While most studies focus on the need for more samples, more genetic markers, better genetic
models or analytic methods, the consistent factor is that heritability is “missing” only for com-
plex diseases. By definition, complex diseases are caused by multiple genetic and environmen-
tal factors. Our current and previous results [20, 29, 68] suggest that interactive effects between
genetic and environmental factors may account for part of the missing heritability. Both types
of data must be included in order to detect interactive effects. Omitting sociocultural data
when the biological effects of genetic variants act through an interaction with the sociocultural
environment makes it impossible to properly interpret the genetic effects. Thus, the lack of
replication in genetic studies of hypertension could be due to a lack of sociocultural stressor
data and inability to test for gene by environment (G x E) interactions.
Our study highlights how a biocultural approach can provide a more complete understand-
ing of a complex disease, such as hypertension. Using a joint analysis that includes ancestry
and genetic data, we replicate previously identified loci for BP variation. More importantly, we
show that inclusion of both genetic and sociocultural data allows the identification of signifi-
cant interaction effects. In our study, a novel measure of discrimination, UT-Other = unfair
treatment of others, suggests that a new class of genes associated with psychosocial distress and
mood disorders may be particularly relevant to the manifestation of hypertension in African
Americans and underlying racial disparities. The unfair treatment measures we capture in our
study are specific to African Americans, but our results may be relevant to other groups who
experience similar discrimination from unfair treatment. The differences we identified
between UT-Other and UT-Self suggest that the biological consequences of discrimination
experiences are complex and not well understood. Further study is warranted to better

 understand the effects that genes and social stressors, like discrimination, have on disease out-
comes and that may contribute to persistent racial disparities in health.
Methods
Ethics Statement
As part of a community based participatory research approach, a local steering committee
(Health Equity Alliance of Tallahassee Steering Committee, Tallahassee, Florida) was formed
to advise on all aspects of the project including informed consent and data dissemination. The
research protocol was also approved by the University of Florida Institutional Review Board
(IRB-01 (#364–2008) and IRB-02 (#2007-U-469)). Informed written consent was obtained
from all participants prior to data collection. Due to the sensitive nature of the sociocultural
data and the potentially identifiable genetics data, the informed consent requires that the
genetic and sociocultural data be made available through our steering committee. The mem-
bers of the steering committee and their contact information are as follows:primary contact—

Research setting and sample population
Data were collected in Tallahassee, Florida from adult African Americans who were selected
using a multistage probability sampling design. Stratification was first performed by Census
block groups using cluster analysis of neighborhood-level indicators of racial composition and
material deprivation to maximize contrasts in relevant social stressors. Next, within each clus-
ter, block groups were randomly selected and then residential addresses within sampled block
groups were chosen. Last, one participant from among eligible adults (self-identified African
American, age 25–65) in each household was selected. The final number of individuals was
157 with complete data, which included buccal swabs for DNA analysis and collection of socio-
cultural and biological data during a face-to-face interview.
Saliva Samples
Saliva samples were collected and stored using Oragene DNA Collection Kits (DNA Genotek,
Ontario, Canada). DNA was extracted according to the manufacturer’s protocol.
Genotyping data
More than 30,000 SNPs and ancestry informative markers (AIMs) on all 22 autosomal chro-
mosomes were genotyped using a custom Affymetrix Axiom Array that we designed (Affyme-
trix, Santa Clara, CA). These SNPs were chosen because they were located within or near
genes that previously had been found to associate with hypertension, cardiac disease, stress,
and pigmentation phenotypes in other studies and on existing Affymetrix arrays (see S4 Table
for a list of the 30,000+ SNPs and associated genes and other attributes). AIMs were identified
from the Illumina African American Admixture panel (Illumina, San Diego, CA). We followed
the recommendations set by Affymetrix’s Axiom Genotyping Console to call all SNP geno-
types that had a genotyping success call rate � 97%. SNP marker properties (minor allele fre-
quency (MAF), call rate, Hardy-Weinberg Equilibrium (HWE) test) were calculated using
PLINK [69] and JMP/Genomics (SAS 9.4). Only SNPs with a MAF >1%, a call rate >95%,
and SNPs that were in HWE were included (p-value >0.001 for HWE test). This resulted in a
final set of 27,559 SNPs and 3,197 AIMs for further analysis.

 Sociocultural and biological data
Sociocultural data were obtained using a survey that was developed based on the initial ethno-
graphic phase of the project. In the ethnographic interviews, many respondents narrated their
experiences of discrimination by citing unfair treatment experienced by someone close to
them, e.g. close friends, family, and coworkers. Using this information, we adapted a standard
measure of perceived discrimination [70, 71] that usually asks only about respondents’ own
experiences in nine social domains (e.g., police, courts, housing), to include if "you or someone
close to you" had been treated unfairly in each domain. If participants answered "yes", we sub-
sequently asked who had experienced the unfair treatment given the following options—you,
your spouse, your parents, your child, your grandchild, a sibling, another relative, or a close
friend. Unfair treatment was measured as an unweighted count of affirmative answers to the
questions of unfair treatment in nine social domains with a maximum theoretical value of
nine. The discrimination scales included: any/major instances of unfair treatment experienced
by the study participant during their lifetime or experienced by individuals close to the study
participant (range of 0–9).
Biological data were also obtained. Weight and height were measured using a digital scale
and portable stadiometer and used to calculate body mass index (BMI) (weight in kg/height in
m2). Data on age, sex, years of education and antihypertensive medication use were collected.
Three resting blood pressure readings were taken at the beginning of the interview using a
standardized protocol in which respondents were seated for approximately 30 minutes and
had not consumed alcohol or tobacco. Blood pressure was measured using an oscillometric
monitor (UA-787, A&D Medical, Tokyo, Japan) that had been validated according to the
European Society of Hypertension protocol [72]. The first readings differed significantly from
the latter two readings and thus an average of the latter two readings was used in the study
analyses. Adjusting for BP medications taken has been shown to be more powerful than fitting
a conventional regression model with treatment as a binary covariate [73]. Thus, we corrected
for antihypertensive medication use by adding 10mmHg to the mean SBP [73] and 5 mmHg
to the mean DBP readings [74] of each participant who was taking antihypertensive medica-
tion. The mean adjusted SBP and DBP measurements were treated as dependent variables in
our analysis.
Inferring Local and Global Ancestry
Each SNP genotype was coded as 0, 1, or 2 copies of the derived allele and used to infer local
ancestry at each SNP (n = 30,756) by running LAMP [75], a method for estimating ancestries
at each locus in a population of admixed individuals. All 30,756 SNPs, including 3,197 AIMs,
were used to infer local ancestry. We used the default parameters set in LAMP, with the num-
ber of populations set to 2, the number of generations set to 7, and the mixture proportions
alpha set to 0.8 African, 0.2 European. The output local ancestry was coded as 0, 1, or 2 copies
of inherited African ancestry. The mean global African Ancestry was estimated by averaging
local ancestry across loci for each individual.
Estimating kinship and relatedness
We used PC-AiR [76], Principal Component Analysis in Related samples, to account for related-
ness in our sample. PC-AiR analysis was run in R using kinship estimates obtained from the
software KING [77] for the 157 participants and 26,343 SNP genotypes that had a minor allele
frequency (MAF) � 5%. PC-AiR identified 120 unrelated individuals and 37 related individu-
als in our sample with a kinship coefficient threshold of 0.025. The top ten PC-AiRs were
included in the admixture and association mapping as covariates to account for relatedness.

 Admixture Mapping
Since the underlying genetic susceptibility of hypertension may be different for elevated SBP
and DBP, we chose to analyze each set of BP measurements separately.
We performed admixture mapping by linearly regressing blood pressure on local ancestry,
adjusted for global ancestry, sex, age, education, BMI and relatedness (PCAiRs1-10) in the fol-
lowing model:
Admixture mapping:
SBPadj ¼ m þ local ancestry þ global ancestry þ sex þ age þ education þ BMI þ PCAiR1� 10
þ ε
DBPadj ¼ m þ local ancestry þ global ancestry þ sex þ age þ education þ BMI þ PCAiR1� 10
þ ε
where ε is assumed to be normally distributed with a mean of zero.
Association Mapping
We performed an association study for blood pressure by linearly regressing blood pressure on
SNP genotype, adjusted for global ancestry, sex, age, education, BMI and relatedness
(PCAiRs1-10) in the following model:
Association mapping:
SBPadj ¼ m þ SNP þ global ancestry þ sex þ age þ education þ BMI þ PCAiR1� 10 þ ε
DBPadj ¼ m þ SNP þ global ancestry þ sex þ age þ education þ BMI þ PCAiR1� 10 þ ε
where ε is assumed to be normally distributed with a mean of zero.
Joint Admixture and Association Mapping
We used Bayesian joint admixture and association mapping with partial Bonferroni correction
[36] to identify SNPs that were associated with BP using posterior probabilities from admix-
ture mapping as the prior probabilities for association mapping. We performed joint admix-
ture and association mapping for mean adjusted SBP and DBP by stratifying based on local
ancestry, linearly regressing blood pressure on local ancestry, adjusting for global ancestry,
sex, age, education, BMI and genetic relatedness (PCAiRs1-10), and recombining the p-values
while adjusting for inverse variance-weighted fixed effects. Due to lack of variance for 1446
SNP genotypes when stratified by ancestry, we excluded these SNPs from the joint admixture
and association mapping.
We developed three progressive models that assessed the association between SNP and BP
(Model 1), SNP and BP including measures of unfair treatment (Model 2), and SNP and BP
including interaction effects between SNP x UT (Model 3).
Model 1:
SBPadj ¼ m þ SNP þ global ancestry þ sex þ age þ education þ BMI þ PCAiR1� 10 þ ε
DBPadj ¼ m þ SNP þ global ancestry þ sex þ age þ education þ BMI þ PCAiR1� 10 þ ε
where ε is assumed to be normally distributed with a mean of zero.

 In Model 2, we performed the same joint admixture and association mapping as in Model 1
with unfair treatment measures added to the model.
Model 2:
SBPadj ¼ m þ SNP þ global ancestry þ sex þ age þ education þ BMI þ UT þ PCAiR1� 10 þ ε
DBPadj ¼ m þ SNP þ global ancestry þ sex þ age þ education þ BMI þ UT þ PCAiR1� 10 þ ε
where ε is assumed to be normally distributed with a mean of zero.
In Model 3, we included an interaction term between SNP genotype and unfair treatment
by performing the same joint admixture and association mapping as in Model 2 with the inter-
action term added to the model.
Model 3:
SBPadj ¼ m þ SNP þ global ancestry þ sex þ age þ education þ BMI þ UT þ SNP � UT
þ PCAiR1� 10 þ ε
DBPadj ¼ m þ SNP þ global ancestry þ sex þ age þ education þ BMI þ UT þ SNP � UT
þ PCAiR1� 10 þ ε
where ε is assumed to be normally distributed with a mean of zero.
We were also interested in testing the “weathering hypothesis,” which proposes a threshold
of experienced discrimination before effects on physical and biological health are observed
[60], so we dichotomized the unfair treatment measures to test in Model 3. We dichotomized
in two ways: No (0 affirmative responses to experiences of unfair treatment questionnaire) ver-
sus Yes (�1 affirmative responses), as has been done in other studies [26]; and Low (0–2 affir-
mative responses to experiences of unfair treatment questionnaire) versus High (� 3)
experience of unfair treatment. We based our cut-off for low versus high experience of unfair
treatment on our previous work where a threshold effect of unfair treatment on blood pressure
was seen at UT-Other � 3 [29]. In order to reduce the effect of outlier values, we further fil-
tered SNP genotypes and included only SNPs with a MAF > 10%. This MAF threshold was
chosen in order to have a reasonable sample size of individuals homozygous for the minor
allele for each level of UT in order to test for interaction effects. This resulted in a final set of
18,324 SNPs. The R code is provided for the admixture mapping, association mapping and the
joint analyses.
Setting significance thresholds
Admixture and association studies were first performed using a frequentist approach. Bonfer-
roni correction was applied in order to correct for multiple testing by dividing the significance
threshold alpha (0.05) by each analysis’ testing burden (the number of tests performed). For
admixture mapping, we estimated the effective number of tests for each chromosome for each
individual by summing the number of local ancestry switches that occur. We summed the
effective number of tests for the 22 autosomal chromosomes for each individual and then aver-
aged across individuals. We used this average number of ancestry switches to correct for multi-
ple testing in admixture mapping. Thus, we set our significance threshold for admixture
analysis to be -log10 (p-value) = -log10 (0.05/78.82) = 3.2. For association mapping, we applied
Bonferroni correction to account for the number of SNPs tested in our analysis that passed the
quality control thresholds described previously. Thus, we set our significance threshold for
association mapping to be–log 10 (p-value) = -log10 (0.05/27,559) = 5.74.

 The joint admixture and association analysis used a Bayesian approach to test for associa-
tion between genotype and BP using local ancestry as our prior. The prior probability is depen-
dent on the degree of African ancestry, with more weight given to an association with a higher
level of African ancestry. In the joint analysis, the testing burdens calculated for admixture and
association analysis were accounted using partial Bonferroni testing. The significance of asso-
ciation for the joint analysis was reported by the joint posterior probability (0–1), with a value
of 1 indicating the highest probability that a SNP is associated to the phenotype. The genome-
wide significance level for the joint posterior probability was set to 0.5, with values equal to or
greater than 0.5 being considered as associated with BP.
Simulation of type I error rate
Any significant association identified in any joint model that had a joint posterior � 0.5 was
simulated 10,000 times to obtain the false positive rate by randomly re-shuffling the associated
blood pressure readings and covariates, which were kept linked to one another, to the SNP
genotype and ancestry estimates, using the joint admixture and association code. We kept
genotype and ancestry data fixed and shuffled the phenotype and covariate data for each par-
ticipant. We set our seed to 385 in R for the simulations. We plotted the distributions of the
simulations and determined that any SNP that reached a posterior prior of �0.5, 500 times or
fewer in the 10,000 simulations was considered a true positive hit (since 500/10,000 = 0.05). In
our results, we only report the significant SNPs that have been confirmed through simulations
for the joint admixture and association analyses.
