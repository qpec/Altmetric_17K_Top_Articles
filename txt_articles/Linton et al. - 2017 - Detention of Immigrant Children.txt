abstract
Immigrant children seeking safe haven in the United States, whether 
arriving unaccompanied or in family units, face a complicated evaluation and 
legal process from the point of arrival through permanent resettlement in 
communities. The conditions in which children are detained and the support 
services that are available to them are of great concern to pediatricians and 
other advocates for children. In accordance with internationally accepted 
rights of the child, immigrant and refugee children should be treated with 
dignity and respect and should not be exposed to conditions that may harm 
or traumatize them. The Department of Homeland Security facilities do not 
meet the basic standards for the care of children in residential settings. The 
recommendations in this statement call for limited exposure of any child to 
current Department of Homeland Security facilities (ie, Customs and Border 
Protection and Immigration and Customs Enforcement facilities) and for 
longitudinal evaluation of the health consequences of detention of immigrant 
children in the United States. From the moment children are in the custody 
of the United States, they deserve health care that meets guideline-based 
standards, treatment that mitigates harm or traumatization, and services 
that support their health and well-being. This policy statement also provides 
specifi
 c recommendations regarding postrelease services once a child 
is released into communities across the country, including a coordinated 
system that facilitates access to a medical home and consistent access to 
education, child care, interpretation services, and legal services.
INTRODUCTION
Communities nationwide have become homes to immigrant and refugee 
children who have fled countries across the globe. 
1 However, in the 
dramatic increase in arrivals that began in 2014 and continues at the 
time of writing this policy statement, more than 95% of undocumented 
children have emigrated from Guatemala, Honduras, and El Salvador 
(the Northern Triangle countries of Central America), with much smaller 
numbers from Mexico and other countries. Most of these undocumented 
children cross into the United States through the southern border.

of children and families in Central 
America are driving an escalation 
of migration to the United States 
from Guatemala, Honduras, and El 
Salvador. 
3, 
 
4 Children, unaccompanied 
and in family units, seeking safe 
haven* in the United States often 
experience traumatic events in 
their countries of origin, during the 
journeys to the United States, and 
throughout the difficult process 
of resettlement.5, 
 
6 In fiscal year 
(FY) 2014, Customs and Border 
Protection (CBP) detained 68 631 
unaccompanied children and 
another 68 684 children in family 
units 
7 (a child with parent[s] or 
legal guardian[s]). In response to 
these numbers, the US government 
implemented a media campaign 
in Central America and increased 
immigration enforcement at the 
southern border of Mexico in 
an effort to deter immigration. 
8 
Yet despite decreasing numbers 
of unaccompanied children and 
children in family units attempting 
to emigrate to the United States in 
FY 2015, another significant increase 
of both groups began in FY 2016, 
with 59 692 unaccompanied children 
and 77 674 family units detained in 
FY 2016. 
2 Interviews with children 
in detention from Mexico and the 
Northern Triangle Countries revealed 
that 58% had fear sufficient to merit 
protection under international law, 
4 
and in another survey, 77% reported 
violence as the main reason for 
fleeing their country. 
9
Children first detained at the time 
of entry to the United States, 
whether they are unaccompanied 
or in family units, are held by the 
Department of Homeland Security 
(DHS) in CBP processing centers.

If an accompanying adult cannot 
verify that he or she is the biological 
parent or legal guardian, this adult 
is separated from the child, and the

child is considered unaccompanied. 
10 
After processing, unaccompanied 
immigrant children are placed in 
shelters or other facilities operated 
by the US Department of Health 
and Human Services (HHS) Office 
of Refugee Resettlement (ORR), 
and the majority are subsequently 
released to the care of community 
sponsors (parents, other adult 
family members, or nonfamily 
individuals) throughout the country 
for the duration of their immigration 
cases. 
11 Children detained with a 
parent or legal guardian are either 
repatriated back to their home 
countries under expedited removal 
procedures, placed in Immigration 
and Customs Enforcement (ICE) 
family residential centers, or released 
into the community to await their 
immigration hearings.12
Pediatricians who care for previously 
detained immigrant children 
in communities throughout the 
United States should be aware of 
the traumatic events these children 
have invariably experienced to 
better understand and address their 
complex medical, mental health, 
and legal needs. Pediatricians also 
have an opportunity to advocate 
for the health and well-being of 
vulnerable immigrant children. This 
policy statement applies principles 
established by numerous previous 
statements, including care of 
immigrant children, 
 
13 toxic stress, 
 
14 
and social determinants of health, 
 
15 
to the specific topic of detention of 
immigrant children.
HISTORY
In the 1980s, the United States 
experienced a dramatic increase 
in numbers of migrant children 
fleeing Central America as a result 
of civil wars in those countries. 
16 
At that time, the Immigration 
and Naturalization Service (INS), 
under the Department of Justice, 
was responsible for enforcing the 
immigration law and seeking the 
deportation of unaccompanied 
children and for their care and 
custody while they were in the 
United States. In 1997, after 
more than a decade of litigation 
responding to unjust treatment of 
unaccompanied children in the care 
of the INS, the government entered 
into a settlement agreement, still in 
force today, for the care of children. 
17 
The Flores Settlement Agreement 
set strict national standards for the 
detention, treatment, and release 
of all minors detained in the legal 
custody of the INS. It requires 
that children be held in the least 
restrictive setting appropriate for 
a child’s needs and that they be 
released without unnecessary delay 
to a parent, designate of the parent, 
or responsible adult as deemed 
appropriate. 
17, 
 
18
After September 11, 2001, the 
Homeland Security Act of 2002 
attempted to resolve the conflict 
of interest between the dual role 
of the INS as both a prosecutor 
and caretaker of unaccompanied 
children. 
19 That law divided the 
functions of the former INS between 
the DHS and HHS ( 
Fig 1). Under 
the DHS, CBP and ICE are charged 
with border control and homeland 
security. 
20, 
 
21 The care and custody 
of unaccompanied immigrant 
children were transferred to the 
HHS Administration for Children 
and Families, specifically the ORR. 
The responsibility of the ORR is to 
promote the well-being of children 
and families, including refugees and 
migrants.22
CURRENT PRACTICE AND 
TERMINOLOGY
Noncitizen children younger than 
18 years are processed through 
the immigration system in several 
ways depending on where they are 
first detained, whether they are 
accompanied or unaccompanied by 
a parent, and whether they come 
from a contiguous or noncontiguous 
2

, number 4, April 2017
country. An unaccompanied 
alien child, referred to as an 
unaccompanied immigrant child 
in this policy statement, is defined 
by the Homeland Security Act 
as a child who “has no lawful 
immigration status in the United 
States; has not attained 18 years of 
age; and with respect to whom—(i) 
there is no parent or legal guardian 
in the United States; or (ii) no 
parent or legal guardian in the 
United States is available to provide 
care and physical custody.” 
11, 
 
23, 
 
24 
A parent or legal guardian is 
considered “not available” if not 
present at the time of the child’s 
apprehension.
Accompanied children are those 
who are detained with their parent 
or legal guardian, most often the 
mother. DHS refers to accompanied 
children as part of a family unit. 
11 
Most children who come into 
immigration custody are first 
detained at the border; a smaller 
number are apprehended within 
the country (ie, more than 100 
miles away from a border), known 
as internal apprehensions. 
11
Lastly, the immigration process is 
different for children who come 
from contiguous countries (most 
from Mexico and smaller numbers 
from Canada). When the Trafficking 
Victims Protection Reauthorization 
Act (TVPRA) was passed in 2008, 
Congress mandated that CBP 
screen children from Mexico and 
Canada for trafficking (child labor 
or sex) and other harms before 
allowing them to return to their 
countries and before they are placed 
in US immigration proceedings. 
Specifically, CBP must screen a child 
from Mexico or Canada to ensure 
that the child is not a potential 
victim of trafficking, has no possible 
claim to asylum, and can and does 
voluntarily accept return. If a child 
from Canada or Mexico does not 
have authorization to enter the 
United States and can be returned 
safely, the child can be repatriated 
without ever being placed in 
immigration proceedings. If any of 
the answers to the aforementioned 
inquiries into protection concerns 
are positive, or if no determination 
of all 3 criteria can be made within 
48 hours, the TVPRA mandates that 
the child shall “immediately” be 
transferred to custody of ORR. Once 
transferred to ORR, Mexican and 
Canadian children are treated like 
all other unaccompanied children in 
detention.

Immigration Pathway
CBP Processing Centers
When first detained at or near 
the border, both unaccompanied 
children and those in family units 
are sent to CBP processing centers. 
Each year, hundreds of thousands 
of detained people are held in these 
processing centers along the US 
southern border. 
10 By law, under 
the Homeland Security Act of 2002 
and TVPRA of 2008, unaccompanied 
immigrant children must be moved 
to ORR custody within 72 hours. 
24, 
 
25 
Processing centers are secure 
facilities of various sizes with locked 
enclosures to detain children and 
families; the largest, in McAllen, 
Texas, currently has a capacity 
of 1000.† Reports by advocacy 
organizations, including interviews 
with detainees and the DHS Office of 
Inspector General, 
 
26 have cataloged 
egregious conditions in many of the 
centers, including lack of bedding 
(eg, sleeping on cement floors), 
open toilets, no bathing facilities, 
constant light exposure, confiscation 
of belongings, insufficient food 
and water, and lack of access to 
legal counsel, 
10, 
 
24, 
‡ and a history of 
extremely cold temperatures. At 
times children and families are kept 
longer than 72 hours, denied access 
to medical care and medications, 
separated from one another, 
or physically and emotionally 
maltreated. 
10, 
 
24, 
 
25 In processing 
centers, children and families lack a 
comprehensive orientation process 
that outlines procedures and possible 
time of detainment in each facility. 
To respond to increasing numbers 
of children and families who are first 
detained in the Rio Grande Valley, a 
central processing center in McAllen, 
Texas has made changes to increase 
capacity, expedite processing, and 
address some of these concerns.§

At the time of apprehension by 
CBP, children pass through 1 or 
more CBP processing facilities, 
some of which provide limited 
medical screening (eg, scabies, 
lice, varicella); complete medical 
histories and physical examinations 
(including vital signs) are not 
conducted. Screening is performed 
by a variety of nonmedical and 
medical personnel, such as border 
patrol officers, emergency medical 
technicians, nurse practitioners, or 
physician assistants.¶ Children with 
medical problems beyond the scope 
of aforementioned personnel are 
taken to a local hospital emergency 
department.**
At the time of release from CBP 
processing centers, the immigration 
pathway diverges for unaccompanied 
immigrant children and children 
accompanied by a parent or legal 
guardian.
ORR Children Shelters: Unaccompanied 
Immigrant Children
ORR contracts with a network of 
child welfare agencies, both nonprofit 
and government organizations, to 
care for unaccompanied immigrant 
children in a variety of facility 
types that range in size and level of 
security. A small number of these 
contracts are with local foster care 
agencies. 
23 With more than 9200 
beds located across the country, 
these shelters have procedures 
ensuring compliance with federal 
law regarding the care and custody 
of immigrant children. 
27 Children 
are provided with dormitory-style 
rooms, shared bathrooms, showers, 
clothes, hot meals, year-round 
educational services, recreational 
activities, and limited legal services. 
In FY 2015, the average length of 
stay in the program was 34 days, 
 
28 
although some children remain in 
ORR custody for significantly longer

periods of time, for a number of 
different reasons.
At the time of entry into an 
ORR facility, children receive an 
initial medical and mental health 
evaluation. 
29 The ORR is responsible 
for providing the children with 
ongoing medical and mental health 
care, which may be provided on or off 
site, while in custody. Pediatricians 
caring for previously detained 
children released into communities 
can access the American Academy of 
Pediatrics (AAP) Immigrant Health 
Toolkit (https://

can ask the child or sponsor for the

Family Residential Centers: 
Accompanied Children
Some family units are released from 
CBP processing centers directly 
into the community to await 
immigration proceedings, some 
undergo expedited return to their 
country of origin, and others are sent 
to ICE-contracted family residential 
centers. Three family detention 
centers exist nationally, including 
2 in Texas, operated by for-profit 
prison corporations (ie, GEO Group 
and CCA) and 1 in Pennsylvania 
operated by local government (ie, 
Berks County); 2 other centers were 
closed because of “dangerously 
inadequate” conditions. 
32, 
 
33 The 
present total operating capacity 
of the detention facilities is 3326 
beds. 
34 Each residential center has 
staff comprising representatives from 
their contracting organizations and 
4

 PEDIATRICS Volume  
139 
, number 4, April 2017
ICE employees. 
34 In general, multiple 
families stay in dormitory-style 
rooms. Nearly all the family detention 
beds are for mothers with children 
younger than 18 years, and 1 facility 
(Berks County) accepts fathers.35 An 
August 2015 ruling by a California 
US District Court in a case brought 
against DHS, Flores v Johnson, found 
that family detention centers are in 
violation of the Flores Settlement 
Agreement. 
36 The court did not 
exclude children in family units from 
the requirement that children be held 
in the least restrictive environments. 
Despite this order, children continue 
to be detained, and even with shorter 
lengths of stay, some were still found 
to suffer traumatic effects. 
32, 
 
37
Care of children held in detention 
centers is subject to the standards 
outlined on the ICE Web site. 
38, 
 
39 
Limited medical, dental, and mental 
health services are provided by 
the prison corporations in the 
Texas facilities and through public 
health services in Pennsylvania. 
38, 
 
39 
Detention centers also rely on nearby 
emergency departments and tertiary 
care centers for the treatment of 
medical and mental health conditions 
beyond their scope. Visits to family 
detention centers in 2015 and 2016 
by pediatric and mental health 
advocates revealed discrepancies 
between the standards outlined 
by ICE and the actual services 
provided, including inadequate 
or inappropriate immunizations, 
delayed medical care, inadequate 
education services, and limited 
mental health services.40 
 
 
 
–45
Alternatives to detention offer 
opportunities to respond to families’ 
needs in the community as their 
immigration cases proceed. For 
most families, release into the 
community allows families to live 
their lives as normally as possible. 
34 
In the setting of community-based 
alternatives to detention, many 
families are able to comply with 
immigration proceedings when they 
are provided information about 
rights and responsibilities, referrals 
to legal services, and psychosocial 
supports. 
34 Some families may 
benefit from case management, 
 
34 
which is cost-effective 
11 and can 
increase the likelihood of compliance 
with government requirements.33 
Alternatives to detention may better 
allow families to identify legal 
services and seek proper medical 
and mental health care that can 
importantly contribute to winning 
asylum cases. 
46
Release of Children Into the Community: 
Unaccompanied Immigrant Children
Before release, the ORR seeks to 
reunite an unaccompanied immigrant 
child with a sponsor, preferably 
a parent or other family member. 
Sponsors must be considered suitable 
for caring for a child and go through 
background checks, occasionally 
including home visits. 
11, 
 
23, 
 
24 
Most children are released to parents 
or other family members; in some 
cases, the sponsor may be someone 
the child does not know well or at all. 
The ORR must approve the child’s 
release, but in almost all cases, the 
sponsor is financially responsible for 
transportation and other expenses 
incurred. 
47 Some children receive 
limited postrelease services from 
nongovernment organizations 
funded by ORR. These services are 
typically provided only to children 
whose release followed a home 
study, required for certain children 
under TVPRA, including those who 
have histories of abuse or trafficking 
or those with disabilities.48, 
 
49 
Most children released from the 
ORR do not qualify for Medicaid, 
the Children’s Health Insurance 
Program, or other state and federal 
public benefit programs. Other 
important stressors may also arise 
once the child has been placed with 
a sponsor, including relationship 
conflicts between child and sponsor 
or other household members, school 
enrollment and other educational 
challenges, food insecurity, housing 
insecurity, other financial strain 
(eg, clothes, school supplies), and 
acculturation difficulties.
Release of Children Into the Community: 
Family Units
Family units arriving together at the 
US border are currently placed into 
“expedited removal proceedings, 
” 
which means that the adult must 
pass a “credible fear interview” 
or, in some cases, a “reasonable 
fear interview” (for families with 
previous orders of removal from the 
United States) before a US Customs 
and Immigration Service officer to 
establish a basis for the presence 
of persecution or torture. If the 
interview is passed, families may be 
released from the detention center 
on bond or released under other 
conditions, such as being required to 
wear an electronic monitor, but only 
for the duration of their immigration 
case. If they do not pass the credible 
fear or reasonable fear interview 
or a judge concurs with a negative 
“fear” decision, they will be removed 
from the United States. 
39 Currently, 
more than 75% of families held 
in family residential centers pass 
their “credible fear” or “reasonable 
fear” interviews or are successful in 
appealing adverse decisions after 
retaining an attorney, meaning that 
most have a right to seek protection 
in the United States. 
34, 
 
50 Families 
who are granted release into 
communities pending immigration 
proceedings may be taken to nearby 
bus terminals or local churches 
but must independently navigate 
reunification with family members 
across the country. Families must 
also find attorneys to represent 
them in their immigration cases, 
which will continue until they appear 
for an asylum hearing before an 
immigration judge or pursue some 
other immigration benefit (such 
as a visa for trafficking victims). 
These families must rely on family 
members living in the United States 
for assistance or incur their own 
travel and legal expenses. Many adult 
members of family units have been

released into the community with 
electronic monitors to ensure that 
their whereabouts can be tracked.

Impact of Detention on Child and Family 
Health
Detention of children is a global issue 
condemned by respected human 
rights and professional organizations 
both within and beyond US 
borders. 
11, 
 
32, 
 
33, 
 
51 Moreover, the 
United Nations Convention on the 
Rights of the Child, an internationally 
recognized legal framework for the 
protection of children’s basic rights 
(ratified by every country in the 
world except for the United States), 
emphasizes freedom from arbitrary 
arrest and detention (Article 37), 
the provision of special protection 
to children seeking asylum (Article 
22), humane and appropriate 
treatment of children in detention 
(Article 37), and guidelines regarding 
maintaining family unity (Article 
9).52 The AAP has endorsed this 
human rights treaty as an important 
legal instrument. 
53 US state court 
proceedings and the United Nations 
Convention on the Rights of the Child 
underscore the “best interests of 
the child, 
” including safety and well-
being, the child’s expressed interests, 
health, family integrity, liberty, 
development (including education), 
and identity. 
54
Studies of detained immigrants, 
primarily from abroad, have found 
negative physical and emotional 
symptoms among detained 
children, 
 
55 
– 
57 and posttraumatic 
symptoms do not always disappear 
at the time of release. 
56 Young 
detainees may experience 
developmental delay58 and poor 
psychological adjustment, potentially 
affecting functioning in school. 
59 
Qualitative reports about detained 
unaccompanied immigrant children 
in the United States found high rates 
of posttraumatic stress disorder, 
anxiety, depression, suicidal ideation, 
and other behavioral problems. 
60 
Additionally, expert consensus has 
concluded that even brief detention 
can cause psychological trauma and 
induce long-term mental health risks 
for children. 
51
Studies of adults in detention have 
demonstrated negative physical 
and mental health effects that 
can reasonably be applied to 
adult members of detained family 
units. For instance, detained adult 
asylum seekers suffered from 
musculoskeletal, gastrointestinal, 
respiratory, and neurologic 
symptoms. 
61 They also commonly 
experienced anxiety, depression, 
posttraumatic stress disorder, 
difficulty with relationships, and self-
harming behavior. 
62 
 
– 
66 Detention 
itself undermines parental authority 
and capacity to respond to their 
children’s needs; this difficulty is 
complicated by parental mental 
health problems. 
56, 
 
67 Although data 
are limited regarding the effects of 
a short detention time on the health 
of children, there is no evidence 
indicating that any time in detention 
is safe for children.
In the United States, reports from 
human rights groups and other child 
advocates, including pediatricians, 
corroborate the deleterious 
effects of detention found in the 
aforementioned studies. 
33, 
 
35, 
 
41 
– 
44 
These reports describe prisonlike 
conditions; inconsistent access to 
quality medical, dental, or mental 
health care; and lack of appropriate

described regressive behavioral 
changes in their children, including 
decreased eating, sleep disturbances,

behavior, and aggression.

Parents often faced difficulty 
parenting their children and 
subsequently experienced strained 
parent–child relationships.44 
Detained families’ sense of isolation 
and desperation were intensified 
by detention center practices that 
created communication barriers with 
the outside world (eg, expensive 
telephone service and lack of Internet 
services). Additionally, detainees 
reported being anxious about the 
lack of access to legal advocates. 
33, 
 
68
After almost a year of investigation, 
the DHS Advisory Committee on 
Family Residential Centers ultimately 
made this recommendation 
34:
DHS’s immigration enforcement practices 
should operationalize the presumption 
that detention is generally neither 
appropriate nor necessary for families—
and that detention or the separation of 
families for purposes of immigration 
enforcement or management are never in 
the best interest of children.
THE ROLE OF PEDIATRICIANS IN THE 
COMMUNITY
Awareness of the immigration 
pathway, conditions in detention 
facilities, and medical care during 
detention can help community 
pediatricians provide sensitive 
and targeted care based on AAP 
recommendations (https://

69 Many 
of these children have never had 
access to a medical home or regular 
primary care surveillance. A trauma-
informed approach acknowledges 
the impact of trauma and potential 
paths for recovery, recognizes 
signs and symptoms of trauma, 
responds by integrating knowledge 
into the system of care, and resists 
retraumatization. 
70 
–72 Trauma-
informed care is essential for medical, 
mental health, and community-based 
services. Unfortunately, access 
to postrelease services is limited, 
because lack of legal status leaves 
immigrant children ineligible for

most public benefits. Most states 
do not provide health care benefits 
to children of undocumented 
immigration status. 
73, 
†† However, by 
law children have the right to a free, 
public education without regard to 
immigration status. 
74 Pediatricians 
can make families aware that newly 
arrived children are entitled to a free 
education and direct them to local 
public school districts for enrollment.
By facilitating access to legal 
representation through screening 
and referral, pediatricians may 
ultimately increase access to health 
care once the immigrant child 
has lawful status. Furthermore, 
pediatricians may provide key 
evidence used by attorneys to 
assist in children’s immigration 
cases. By some estimates, nearly 
45% of unaccompanied children in 
deportation proceedings do not have 
attorneys in immigration court. 
75 
Not surprisingly, children without 
counsel are far more likely to be 
deported, regardless of the merits 
of their case or the dangers to which 
they would return. 
76 The complexity 
of immigration law makes it all the 
more imperative for practitioners 
who care for immigrant children and 
youth to have a referral network of 
legal experts (preferably nonprofit 
or pro bono) with whom they work 
closely.
A basic understanding of the 
different forms of legal relief can help 
pediatricians collect key medical and 
psychosocial histories and clinical 
evidence that may be used to support 
legal claims by children seeking 
safe haven. The most common legal 
statuses pursued by previously 
detained children include special 
immigrant juvenile status, asylum, 
and what are often referred to as 
visas for victims of trafficking (T visa) 
or serious crimes (U visa). 
11 Histories 
††At the time of writing this policy statement, only 
5 states (New York, Massachusetts, Washington, 
Illinois, and California) and the District of 
Columbia provided health care benefi
 ts to all 
children regardless of immigration status.
of abuse, neglect, abandonment, 
persecution, trafficking, or violence 
may be disclosed to clinicians but 
not lawyers because of fear or 
shame. Furthermore, victims of 
labor or child sex trafficking and 
commercial sexual exploitation 
of children rarely self-identify. 
When assessing the trauma history 
of previously detained children, 
pediatricians may identify concerns 
for trafficking 
77 and subsequently 
facilitate needed medical and mental 
health care and initiate referrals to 
law enforcement, child protective 
services, and legal services. 
78 
Children who are identified as 
victims of trafficking may be eligible 
for a T visa, and children who are 
victims of crimes in this country, 
including exposure to domestic 
violence, may be eligible for a U visa 
if they are willing to cooperate with 
law enforcement. Trauma-focused 
treatment can facilitate disclosure 
of painful histories to children’s 
lawyers and judges, thereby 
improving chances for winning legal 
relief. By referring children for legal 
services and providing affidavits 
or court testimonies, pediatricians 
can directly advocate on behalf 
of children facing immigration 
proceedings.
RECOMMENDATIONS
Pediatricians have the opportunity 
to advocate for systems that mitigate 
trauma and protect the health and 
well-being of vulnerable immigrant 
children. Children, especially those 
who have been exposed to trauma 
and violence, should not be placed 
in settings that do not meet basic 
standards for children’s physical 
and mental health and that expose 
children to additional risk, fear, and 
trauma. Until the unprecedented 
2014 increase in Central American 
migration, children detained with 
a parent or legal guardian were 
released into the community. The 
government’s decision in 2014 to 
place them in family detention was 
intended, in part, to send a message 
of deterrence abroad. 
8 It is the 
position of the AAP that children in 
the custody of their parents should 
never be detained, nor should they 
be separated from a parent, unless a 
competent family court makes that 
determination. In every decision 
about children, government decision-
makers should prioritize the best 
interests of the child. 
54
The following recommendations 
pertain to handling of immigrant 
children, including their health care, 
while they are in custody:
 
• Treat all immigrant children and 
families seeking safe haven who 
are taken into US immigration 
custody with dignity and respect to 
protect their health and well-being.
 
• Eliminate exposure to conditions 
or settings that may retraumatize 
children, such as those that 
currently exist in detention, or 
detention itself.
 
• Separation of a parent or primary 
caregiver from his or her children 
should never occur, unless 
there are concerns for safety of 
the child at the hand of parent. 
Efforts should always be made to 
ensure that children separated 
from other relatives are able to 
maintain contact with them during 
detention.
 
• While in custody, unaccompanied 
children and family units should 
be provided with child-friendly 
orientation and regular updates 
regarding their current status, 
expectations, and rights.
 
• Because conditions at CBP 
processing centers are inconsistent 
with AAP recommendations for 
appropriate care and treatment of 
children, children should not be 
subjected to these facilities.
 
• Processing of children and family 
units should occur in a child-
friendly manner, taking place 
outside current CBP processing 
7

 FROM THE AMERICAN ACADEMY OF PEDIATRICS
centers or conducted by child 
welfare professionals, to provide 
conditions that emphasize the 
health and well-being of children 
and families at this critical stage of 
immigration proceedings.
 
• DHS should discontinue the general 
use of family detention and instead 
use community-based alternatives 
to detention for children held in 
family units.
 
• Community-based case 
management should be 
implemented for children and 
families, thus ending both 
detention and the placement of 
electronic tracking devices on 
parents. Government funding 
should be provided to support case 
management programs.
 
• Children, whether unaccompanied 
or accompanied, should receive 
timely, comprehensive medical 
care that is culturally and 
linguistically sensitive by medical 
providers trained to care for 
children. This care should be 
consistent throughout all stages 
of the immigration processing 
pathway.
 
• Trauma-informed mental health 
screening and care are critical 
for immigrant children seeking 
safe haven. Screening should 
be conducted once a child is in 
the custody of US officials via a 
validated mental health screening 
tool, with periodic rescreening, 
additional evaluation, and trauma-
informed care available for 
children and their parents.
 
• When children are in the custody 
of the federal government, extra 
precautions must be in place to 
identify and protect children who 
have been victims of trafficking 
and to prevent recruitment of new 
children into the trafficking trade.
 
• Children should be provided with 
language-appropriate, year-round 
educational services, including 
special education if needed, 
throughout the immigration 
pathway.
 
• Recreational and social enrichment 
activities, such as opportunities 
for physical activity and creative 
expression, may alleviate stress 
and foster resiliency and should be 
part of any program for detained 
children. At a minimum, outdoor 
and major muscle activity should 
meet the minimum standards 
set by the Flores Settlement 
Agreement.
 
• Children and families should have 
access to legal counsel throughout 
the immigration pathway. 
Unaccompanied minors should 
have free or pro bono legal counsel 
with them for all appearances 
before an immigration judge.
 
• The AAP encourages longitudinal 
evaluation of the health 
consequences of detention of 
immigrant children in the United 
States.
Given the complex medical, 
mental health, and legal needs 
of these children, the following 
recommendations pertain to 
postrelease care of previously 
detained immigrant children in the 
community. Children and families 
need a coordinated system that 
facilitates access to a medical home 
that can address the children’s 
physical and mental health needs and 
facilitates access to education, child 
care, and legal and interpretation 
services.
 
• The AAP advocates for expanded 
funding for postrelease services 
to promote the safety and well-
being of all previously detained 
immigrant children and to 
facilitate connection and access 
to comprehensive services, 
including medical homes, in the 
community. Community-based 
case management should be 
implemented for children and 
families.
 
• All immigrant children seeking safe 
haven should have comprehensive 
health care and insurance 
coverage, which includes the 
right to access qualified medical 
interpretation covered by medical 
benefits, pending immigration 
proceedings.
 
• Children not connected to medical 
homes may first present to 
nonprimary care settings. Pediatric 
providers and staff in these 
facilities, particularly urgent care 
and emergency departments, can 
support referral to the medical 
home and access to comprehensive 
services.
 
• Pediatric providers can refer 
to the AAP Immigrant Health 
Toolkit (https://

aspx) as a resource for care of 
immigrant children.
 
• Pediatric providers should 
familiarize themselves with 
trauma-informed care and 
promote access to comprehensive 
mental health evaluation in the 
community. The AAP Trauma 
Toolbox for Primary Care (https://

offers an accessible resource for 
pediatricians to build these skills. 
Integrated behavioral health in the 
primary care setting is an optimal 
model for care of immigrant 
and other vulnerable children, 
minimizing the difficulty in 
navigating the health care system.
 
• Pediatric providers serving 
previously detained immigrant 
children should elicit specific 
history of abuse, neglect, 
abandonment, persecution, 
trafficking, or violence to 
screen children for legal needs 
and subsequently refer these 
children for legal services. 
Integrated care strategies, such as 
8

 PEDIATRICS Volume  
139 
, number 4, April 2017
medical–legal partnerships, may 
increase connectivity. Likewise, 
immigration lawyers should have 
opportunities to refer children to 
medical homes if children reach 
the legal system before seeking 
medical care.
 
• Pediatric practices should facilitate 
children’s enrollment in public 
educational services, essential to 
children’s development and future 
well-being.
 
• School facilities should be safe 
settings for immigrant children to 
access education. School records 
and facilities should not be used 
in any immigration enforcement 
action.
 
• No child, whether accompanied 
or unaccompanied, should ever 
represent himself or herself 
in court. After release into the 
community, all previously detained 
immigrant children should have 
access to legal services at no cost to 
the child or his or her sponsor.
 
• Child trafficking victims and other 
unaccompanied children should 
be appointed independent child 
advocates, pursuant to TVPRA, to 
advocate for their best interests 
on all issues, including conditions 
of custody, release to family or 
sponsors, and relief from removal.
 
• Pediatricians everywhere should 
advocate for comprehensive, high-
quality health care in a medical 
home for all children in the United 
States, including all immigrant 
children and those detained or 
otherwise in the care of the state.
CONCLUSIONS
The AAP supports comprehensive 
health care in a medical home for 
all children in the United States, 
including all immigrant children 
and those detained or otherwise 
in the care of the state. Children 
deserve protection from additional 
traumatization in the United States 
and the identification and treatment 
of trauma that may have occurred in 
children’s country of origin, during 
migration, or during immigration 
processing or detention in the 
United States. The AAP endorses 
the humane treatment of all 
immigrant children seeking safe 
haven in the United States, whether 
unaccompanied or in family units, 
throughout the immigration 
pathway.
