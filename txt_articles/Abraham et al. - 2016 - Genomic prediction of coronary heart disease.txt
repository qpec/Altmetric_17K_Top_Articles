Aims
Genetics plays an important role in coronary heart disease (CHD) but the clinical utility of genomic risk scores
(GRSs) relative to clinical risk scores, such as the Framingham Risk Score (FRS), is unclear. Our aim was to con-
struct and externally validate a CHD GRS, in terms of lifetime CHD risk and relative to traditional clinical risk
scores.
...................................................................................................................................................................................................
Methods and
results
We generated a GRS of 49 310 SNPs based on a CARDIoGRAMplusC4D Consortium meta-analysis of CHD, then
independently tested it using five prospective population cohorts (three FINRISK cohorts, combined n ¼ 12 676,
757 incident CHD events; two Framingham Heart Study cohorts (FHS), combined n ¼ 3406, 587 incident CHD
events). The GRS was associated with incident CHD (FINRISK HR ¼ 1.74, 95% confidence interval (CI) 1.61–1.86
per S.D. of GRS; Framingham HR ¼ 1.28, 95% CI 1.18–1.38), and was largely unchanged by adjustment for known
risk factors, including family history. Integration of the GRS with the FRS or ACC/AHA13 scores improved the 10
years risk prediction (meta-analysis C-index: þ1.5–1.6%, P < 0.001), particularly for individuals �60 years old (meta-
analysis C-index: þ4.6–5.1%, P < 0.001). Importantly, the GRS captured substantially different trajectories of abso-
lute risk, with men in the top 20% of attaining 10% cumulative CHD risk 12–18 y earlier than those in the bottom
20%. High genomic risk was partially compensated for by low systolic blood pressure, low cholesterol level, and
non-smoking.
...................................................................................................................................................................................................
Conclusions
A GRS based on a large number of SNPs improves CHD risk prediction and encodes different trajectories of life-
time risk not captured by traditional clinical risk scores.

Introduction
Early and accurate identification of individuals with increased risk of
coronary heart disease (CHD) is critical for effective implementation
of preventative lifestyle modifications and medical interventions, such
as statin treatment.1,2 To this end, risk scores such as the
Framingham Risk Score (FRS)3 and the American College of
Cardiology/American Heart Association 2013 risk score (ACC/
AHA13),1 based on clinical factors and lipid measurements, have
been developed and are widely used. Although the scores can iden-
tify individuals at very high risk, a large proportion of individuals de-
veloping CHD during the next 10 years remain unidentified. In
particular, they do not provide sufficient discrimination at a younger
age when implementation of preventative measures is likely to pro-
vide the greatest long-term benefit.
Genetic factors have long been recognized to make a substantial
contribution to CHD risk.4 Although a positive family history is an in-
dependent risk factor for CHD, it may not completely and solely cap-
ture genetic
risk. Recently,
genome-wide association studies
(GWAS) have identified 56 genetic loci associated with CHD at
genome-wide significance.5–9 Studies of the predictive power of the
top single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) at some of these loci ei-
ther individually or in combination have typically shown small im-
provements in CHD risk prediction,10–17 probably because together
these variants only explain less than 20% of CHD heritability.8 As
demonstrated recently for other traits such as height and BMI,18,19
the majority of unexplained heritability is likely hidden amongst the
thousands of SNPs that did not reach genome-wide significance.
Indeed, recent advances have shown that genomic prediction models
that consider all available genetic variants can more efficiently stratify
those at increased risk of complex disease.20–24 To leverage the max-
imum amount of information, we examined whether a genomic risk
score (GRS) comprising a large number of SNPs, including those with
less than genome-wide significance, could produce clinically relevant
predictive power for CHD risk.
Methods
A summary of the key methods for the study is given here. The study de-
sign is given in Figure 1. Additional details are provided in the see
Supplementary material online, Supplementary Appendix.
Prospective study cohorts
We utilized two sets of prospective cohorts: (i) FINRISK, consisting of
three prospective cohorts from Finland with 10–20 years of follow-up,
from collections 1992, 1997, and 2002 (FR92, FR97, and FR02, respect-
ively)25 and (ii) the Framingham Heart Study (FHS),26–28 with individuals
of Western and Southern European ancestry taken from the Original and
Offspring cohorts with 40–48 years of follow-up. In total, the FINRISK
consisted of n ¼ 12 676 individuals and the FHS of n ¼ 3406 individuals,
all of whom had the requisite data and were independent of the
CARDIoGRAMplusC4D stage-2 meta-analysis utilized to generate the
GRS (Table 1). The cohorts have been genome-wide SNP genotyped and
further
imputed
to
the
1000
Genomes
reference
panel
(see
Supplementary material online, Supplementary Methods). After genotype
imputation and quality control, 69 044 autosomal SNPs of the 79 128
CARDIoGRAMplusC4D SNPs were available for subsequent analyses in
the FINRISK, and 78 058 autosomal SNPs available in FHS.
The outcome of interest in FINRISK was primary incident CHD event,
defined as myocardial infarction (MI), a coronary revascularization pro-
cedure, or death from CHD, before age 75 years (see Supplementary ma
terial online, Supplementary Methods). Individuals with prevalent cardio-
vascular disease (CVD) at baseline were excluded from the analysis. We
censored events for individuals with an attained age of>75 years, as not
all FINRISK cohorts had sufficient numbers of CHD events beyond that
age. In FHS, we used the FHS definition of CHD, which included recog-
nized/unrecognized MI or death from CHD as well as angina pectoris or
coronary insufficiency (see Supplementary material online, Supplementary
Methods). FHS individuals with prevalent CHD or<30 years of age at
baseline were excluded, and for consistency with the FINRISK analysis, a
censoring age of 75 years was also applied to the FHS analyses.
Secondary external validation of the GRS was also performed in the
ARGOS study, a Dutch case/control dataset where all individuals had fa-
milial hypercholesterolemia (248 young cases with early CHD, 216 eld-
erly controls without CHD), imputed to 1000 Genomes reference panel
(74 135 SNPs of the 79 128 CARDIoGRAMplusC4D SNPs were avail-
able; see Supplementary material online, Supplementary Methods).
Statistical analysis
GRSs were generated via thinning the CARDIoGRAMplusC4D SNPs by
linkage disequilibrium (LD) thresholds and evaluated using logistic regres-
sion and area under receiver-operating characteristic curve (AUC) for
each threshold (see Supplementary material online, Figure S1). To avoid
overfitting
we
only
used
weights
(log
odds)
from
the
CARDIoGRAMplusC4D stage-2 meta-analysis, which were not based on
the WTCCC-CAD or MIGen studies (see Supplementary material on-
line, Supplementary Methods). We combined the estimates for WTCCC
and MIGen-Harps using fixed-effects inverse-variance weighted meta-
analysis.
Subsequent performance of the GRS was evaluated in external, inde-
pendent validation data. For analysis of FINRISK, we used Cox propor-
tional hazard models to evaluate the association of the GRS with time to
incident CHD events, stratifying by sex and adjusting for geographic loca-
tion and cohort, using age as the time scale. Secondary analyses adjusted
for one of the clinical risk scores (FRS or ACC/AHA13), or individual
baseline variables and known risk factors (cohort, geographical location,
prevalent type-2 diabetes, log total cholesterol, log HDL, log systolic BP,
smoking status, lipid treatment, and family history). Family history in
FINRISK was self-reported and was defined as having a 1st-degree relative
who had experienced MI before age 60. For FHS, we evaluated the asso-
ciation of the GRS with incident CHD using Cox proportional hazard
models, stratifying by sex and adjusting for cohort (Original or Offspring),
using age as the time scale. Family history was not available for both FHS
cohorts and thus not considered in FHS analyses. Survival analyses allow-
ing for competing risks were performed using the Aalen-Johansen estima-
tor of survival and cause-specific Cox models (see Supplementary
material online, Supplementary Methods). Model discrimination of incident
CHD event was evaluated in three groups of individuals: (i) all individuals
(n ¼ 12 676 in FINRISK, n ¼ 3406 in FHS), (ii) individuals aged <60 years
at baseline (n ¼ 10 606 in FINRISK, n ¼ 3218 in FHS), and (iii) individuals
aged�60 years at baseline (n ¼ 2070 in FINRISK, n ¼ 188 in FHS).
Discrimination of incident CHD events within 10 years was assessed
using Harrell’s C-index, and the difference in C-index between two mod-
els was assessed using the correlated jackknife test. Competing risk ana-
lyses were performed using the Aalen-Johansen empirical estimator of
cumulative incidence and cause-specific Cox proportional hazard models.
Risk reclassification was evaluated using continuous Net Reclassification
Improvement (NRI), categorical NRI, and Integrated Discrimination
Improvement.

Results
To construct an optimized GRS using the WTCCC and MIGen-
Harps datasets, we first generated a series of GRSs, starting with the
79 128 CARDIoGRAMplusC4D SNPs then progressively lowering
the r2 threshold for LD to reduce the redundancy of predictive infor-
mation and corresponding number of SNPs in the score (Methods
and Figure 1). An r2 threshold of 0.7 provided optimal discrimination
of CHD cases and controls (WTCCC and MIGen-Harps meta-ana-
lysis odds ratio(OR) ¼ 1.70 per S.D. of GRS, 95% confidence interval
(CI 1.61–1.80; meta-analysis AUC ¼ 0.64, 95% CI 0.63–0.66), corres-
ponding to 49 310 SNPs in WTCCC (see Supplementary material
online, Figure S1). Of these 49 310 SNPs, 85.9% (42 364 SNPs) and
95% (46 773 SNPs) were available in the FINRISK and FHS,
respectively.
The 49K GRS showed similar odds ratios for incident CHD as a
binary outcome in FINRISK (OR ¼ 1.74, 95% CI 1.61–1.89, per S.D.),
WTCCC (OR ¼ 1.74, 95% CI 1.63–1.86, per S.D.), and MIGen-
Harps (OR ¼ 1.57, 95% CI 1.37–1.81, per S.D.) (Table 2). However in
the FHS, the association was weaker, OR¼ 1.30 (95% CI 1.19–1.43,
per S.D.) (Table 2). Density plots of the GRS in FINRISK and FHS for
those with and without CHD <75 years are shown in see
Supplementary material online, Figure S2.
Using survival analyses of time to incident CHD, within FINRISK
the GRS had stronger association with CHD (HR ¼ 1.74, 95% CI
1.61–1.86, per S.D.) than the 28 SNP score studied by Tikkanen
et al.11 (HR ¼ 1.21, 95% CI 1.13–1.30, per S.D.), the 27 SNP score
used by Mega et al.29 (HR ¼ 1.21, 95% CI 1.12–1.30 per S.D.), or the
153 SNPs found at FDR <0.05 by the CARDIoGRAMplusC4D con-
sortium8
(HR ¼ 1.25,
95%
CI
1.16–1.39
per
S.D.)
(see
Supplementary material online, Supplementary Results). In FHS, the
GRS showed weaker but statistically significant association with CHD
(HR ¼ 1.28 per S.D. of the GRS, 95% CI 1.18–1.38). The fixed-effect
meta-analysis estimate for the GRS combining FINRISK and FHS was
HR ¼ 1.66 (95% CI 1.55–1.78), however, heterogeneity was high
(I2¼89.2%, Cochran’s Q P ¼ 0.0023). The top vs. bottom quintiles of
the GRS showed significantly different incident CHD risk overall
(FINRISK HR¼ 4.51, 95% CI 3.47–5.85; FHS HR¼ 1.84 95% CI 1.43–
2.37). For both FINRISK and FHS, the GRS showed improved predic-
tion for incident CHD over the other risk scores composed of
smaller numbers of SNPs (see Supplementary material online,
Supplementary Results and Table S3).
In both FINRISK and FHS, the hazard ratios for GRS were not sub-
stantially attenuated by adjusting for FRS or ACC/AHA13 clinical risk
scores, lipid treatment at baseline, other established risk factors

CHD risk conferred by the GRS was largely independent of the ef-
fects of cholesterol, we further validated the GRS in the ARGOS fa-
milial hypercholesterolemia study, with comparable results to those
obtained in WTCCC/MIGen (OR ¼ 1.49, 95% CI 1.21–1.84 per S.D.
of the GRS, adjusted for sex and five principal components) (see
Supplementary material online, Supplementary Methods).
To assess the predictive power of the GRS, we compared its per-
formance in discrimination of time to CHD event (C-index) with that
of family history and the FRS and ACC/AHA13 clinical risk scores.
We also assessed the incremental value of the GRS on top of the clin-
ical risk scores. In both FINRISK and FHS, addition of GRS to either
FRS or ACC/AHA13 scores provided statistically significant improve-
ments in C-index, in FINRISK:þ1.7% (P < 10 � 6) and þ1.6%
(P < 10 � 6) for FRS and ACC/AHA13, respectively; in FHS:þ1.1%
(P < 0.0443) and þ1.1% (P < 0.0344) for FRS and ACC/AHA13, re-
spectively (Figure 2). Overall, fixed-effects meta-analysis of the two
studies showed that GRS improved the C-index by þ1.6% (95% CI
0.01–0.02, P < 10 � 6; heterogeneity: I2¼2.2%, Q ¼ 1.02, P ¼ 0.312)
for FRS and GRS combined (FRS þ GRS) over FRS alone and,
similarly, þ1.5% (95% CI 0.009–0.02, P < 10 � 6; heterogeneity:
I2¼0%, Q ¼ 0.78, P ¼ 0.378) for ACC/AHA13 þ GRS over ACC/
AHA13 alone (Figure 2). Larger increases in C-index were observed
among older individuals, with the C-index of FRSþ GRS compared
with FRS alone increasing by 5.1% in individuals aged �60 years at
baseline, while individuals aged <60 years at baseline showed C-
index gains of 1.4% (see Supplementary material online, Figure S6).
Within FINRISK, the GRS had higher C-index than family history (þ1.
9%, P < 1.3� 10 � 6).
We assessed if the GRS improved the individual 10 years risk re-
classification when added to clinical risk scores. Analyses within
FINRISK and FHS are given in Table 3 for FRS and in Table 4 for ACC/
AHA13. Overall, meta-analysis of the two datasets showed that the
categorical Net Reclassification Improvement was 0.1 for both
FRSþ GRS and ACC/AHA13 þ GRS, respectively (P < 0.0001; see
Supplementary material online, Figure S7). Meta-analysis of continu-
ous NRI was 0.344 (P < 0.001) and 0.334 (P < 0.001) for the
FRSþ GRS
and
ACC/AHA13 þ GRS,
respectively
(see
Supplementary material online, Figure S8). Meta-analysis of IDI scores
showed gains of 0.01 (P < 0.001) and 0.009 (P < 0.001) for
FRSþ GRS and ACC/AHA13 þ GRS, respectively, however IDI
scores showed high heterogeneity across FINRISK and FHS
(I2>97%, Cochran’s Q P < 0.0001, see Supplementary material on-
line, Figure S9).
We next examined how variation in genomic risk translated into
differences in cumulative lifetime risk of CHD, using Kaplan-Meier
Figure 2 Difference in C-index (95% CI) for time to incident CHD event within 10 years, relative to the reference model in the FINRISK and FHS
cohorts. Reference models used age as the time scale, stratified by sex (FINRISK: adjusted for cohort and geographic location; FHS: adjusted for co-
hort). Family history was not available for all of the FHS cohorts and thus not considered here. P-values are from the correlated jackknife test.

estimates stratified by GRS quintiles for men and women separately
(Figure 3). As expected, cumulative risk increased with age for both
sexes, with men displaying higher absolute risk than women. In both
sexes there were substantial differences in cumulative risk between
GRS groups with 1.7-fold (in FHS) to 3.2-fold (in FINRISK) higher cu-
mulative risk by age 75 in those in the top quintile of GRS vs. bottom
quintile. When considering clinically relevant levels of risk, FINRISK
men in the top quintile of genomic risk achieved 10% cumulative risk
18 years earlier than those in the bottom quintile (ages 52 and 70, re-
spectively), with a comparable difference of 12 years in FHS (ages 51
and 64). Women in the top quintile of genomic risk achieved 10% cu-
mulative risk by age 69 (FINRISK) and 64 (FHS), whereas women in
the bottom quintile did not achieve 10% risk by age 75 in FINRISK, or
by age 73 in FHS. Estimated lifetime CHD risk in FINRISK showed no
evidence of being affected by competing risks (incident CHD vs. non-
CHD death) (see Supplementary material online, Supplementary
Methods and Supplementary Figure S10). Similarly, a cause-specific
competing-risk Cox analysis of the GRS in FINRISK, adjusting for geo-
graphical location and cohort, resulted in a similar hazard ratio as
standard Cox analysis (HR ¼ 1.70, 95% CI 1.61–1.86).
We next sought to investigate to what degree high genomic risk
for CHD could be compensated for by low levels of clinical risk fac-
tors at baseline, and vice-versa. When considering baseline smoking
status in both FINRISK and FHS, Kaplan-Meier analysis showed a sub-
stantial increase in cumulative risk of CHD in men who smoked and
were also in the top quintile of genomic risk, relative to either non-
smokers or smokers at low genomic risk (Figure 4 for FINRISK and
see Supplementary material online, Figure S11 for FHS). Similar but
weaker trends were observed for women in the top vs. bottom quin-
tiles of genomic risk. To test whether there was evidence for smoking
affecting CHD hazard differently based on an individual’s genomic
background, we used a Cox model allowing for an interaction term

between the GRS and smoking; the interaction was not statistically
significant in FINRISK (P ¼ 0.91) and FHS (P ¼ 0.49).
We also examined the potential compensatory effects of baseline
systolic blood pressure and total cholesterol, divided as tertiles of
high, medium, and low levels (see Supplementary material online,
Figures S12 and S13). For both systolic blood pressure and total chol-
esterol, we observed the expected trends in CHD risk for high, me-
dium and low levels. However, males with high vs. low levels of
systolic blood pressure or total cholesterol showed greater absolute
CHD risk if they were in the top vs. bottom quintiles of genomic risk.
Notably, in both FINRISK and FHS, women in the bottom quintile
of genomic risk showed smaller differences in cumulative CHD risk
when stratified by smoking. For tertiles of systolic blood pressure or
total cholesterol, low genomic risk women in FINRISK showed simi-
larly small differences in risk, but the effects in FHS for this subgroup
were not consistent. Cox models allowing for interactions between
the GRS and systolic blood pressure or total cholesterol did not
show statistically significant interactions in either FINRISK or FHS
(P > 0.2 for all).
Discussion
We have generated a GRS for CHD based on 49 310 SNPs and, using
three prospective FINRISK and two FHS prospective cohorts, dem-
onstrated that the GRS is associated with incident CHD events inde-
pendently of established and widely-used clinical risk scores or
individual CHD risk factors, including family history. Secondary valid-
ation in a familial hypercholesterolemia study (ARGOS) showed that
GRS was also associated with CHD in this group of high-risk individ-
uals. Subsequently, combining the GRS with established risk scores
improved 10-year CHD risk prediction in FINRISK and FHS. We
have also shown that the GRS can be leveraged to achieve meaningful
lifetime CHD risk stratification, and that the impact of traditional

CHD risk factors such as smoking, blood pressure, and cholesterol,
vary substantially depending on the underlying genetic risk, thus offer-
ing the potential for both earlier and more targeted preventative
efforts.
A distinctive feature of our analysis compared with several previ-
ous prospective studies11,29,30 examining the predictive utility of GRS
for incident CHD is that the best predictive model was achieved here
with SNPs that did not necessarily reach genome-wide or even statis-
tical significance in previous GWA studies. The GRS outperformed
other smaller SNP models, and shows greater promise in CHD pre-
diction between top and bottom GRS quintiles than a recently pub-
lished study testing a genetic risk score of 50 SNPs in Scandinavians30
(GRS50 HR¼ 1.92 vs. GRS49K HR¼ 4.51). Genome-wide SNP
models have been applied successfully to other heritable human traits
which seem to follow an “infinitesimal” genetic architecture, such as
height.18 These results highlight the differing goals of GWAS and of
genomic prediction: the stringent detection of causal genetic variants
involved in the disease process vs. the construction of a model that
robustly and maximally predicts future disease. While stringent pro-
cedures for minimizing the false positive rate of associated loci in
GWAS are appropriate, these concerns are less relevant in construc-
tion of GRSs, especially when there are a large number of weakly cor-
related SNPs20 and when rigorous internal and external validation is
performed.
While population stratification is a potential confounder of gen-
omic prediction studies, our use of a large worldwide multi-ethnic
meta-analysis to develop the GRS together with two fully independ-
ent prospective validation datasets and three independent case/con-
trol datasets minimizes this potential. Our GRS was constructed
from the CARDIoGRAMplusC4D stage-2 meta-analysis and the
FINRISK and FHS individuals are both independent of that study and
of broadly European ancestry; thus it is unlikely that the GRS is sub-
stantially confounded by fine-scale population structure within these
cohorts. Further, the LD-thinning threshold to maximize prediction

was determined in the WTCCC and MIGen datasets prior to apply-
ing the GRS to ARGOS, FINRISK, or FHS. Nevertheless, for some
measures, GRS gains were less pronounced in FHS than in FINRISK.
This may partly be due to the different definitions of CHD in these
studies, to differences in environmental exposures, or to differences
in genetic effects.31 In addition, the FRS was developed in the FHS,
leading to potential over-estimation of its association with CHD in
the current analysis. Hence, there may be benefit from future devel-
opment of population-specific GRSs, which may yield greater predict-
ive power within each population.
The association of the GRS with incident CHD was not substantially
attenuated by traditional risk factors or clinical risk scores derived from
these risk factors. Furthermore, the GRS was strongly associated with
CHD in a study consisting purely of individuals with familial hyperchol-
esterolemia. These results suggest that genomic risk exerts its effect on
CHD risk through molecular pathways that are largely independent of
the effects of cholesterol, systolic blood pressure, and smoking. A hith-
erto unresolved question has been the extent to which a family history
would capture any information that may be provided through genetic
analysis. Here, we clearly demonstrate the superior performance of
direct genetic information over self-reported family history of CHD,
which is often incomplete and imprecise in practice and is influenced
by family size and competing causes of death.
While we observed improvements in discrimination (C-index) re-
sulting from adding the GRS to the clinical risk scores when
considering adults of all ages, the improvements were substantially
higher in older individuals (>60 years old). Rather than being driven
by age-related differences in the effect of the GRS, these results are
likely driven by differences in the clinical risk scores between the
younger and older adults. Unlike the GRSs, the clinical risk scores
showed substantial differences across ages, driven by temporal
changes in the underlying risk factors as well as age itself. Beyond the
aims of identifying older adults with high CHD risk, the invariance of
genomic risk makes it particularly useful for CHD risk prediction ear-
lier in life, in young adulthood or before, when traditional risk factors
are typically not measured and less likely to be informative of risk
later in life.
Our analyses focused on two clinical scores, the FRS and ACC/
AHA13. While other scores exist, for example the SCORE system,32
we elected to use the FRS and ACC/AHA13 due to their widespread
use and the fact that the FINRISK cohorts were a major contributor
to the SCORE analysis, potentially biasing the analysis in FINRISK, in
the same way that FRS seems to be biased towards the FHS, inflating
its predictive power of the clinical risk scores there relative to the ref-
erence model.
Stratifying individual baseline smoking, systolic blood pressure, and
total cholesterol levels measures into genomic risk groups revealed
substantial differences in cumulative risk patterns. Importantly, this
demonstrates that improved lifestyle may compensate for the innate
increased CHD risk captured by the GRS. For men with high genomic

risk, modifiable risk factors showed large effects on cumulative CHD
risk. For women, the observed impacts of smoking, systolic blood
pressure, and total cholesterol were low or not detectable in the low
genomic risk group, particularly in FINRISK, however, we could not
determine whether this was due to inadequate statistical power or
other biological effects and further studies in larger cohorts of
women are necessary to determine any clinical implications.
Our results, if validated in further studies and across different
populations, suggest a potential paradigmatic shift in the current
CHD screening strategy which has existed for over 40 years—
namely determination of genomic risk at an early stage with screening
later in life through traditional clinical risk scores to complement
background genomic risk. Based on early genomic risk stratification,
individuals at higher risk may benefit from earlier engagement with
nutritionists, exercise regimes, smoking cessation programs or be ini-
tiated early on medical interventions such as statin therapy or blood-
pressure lowering medications to minimize future CHD risk. In this
context it is notable that Mega et al.29 recently demonstrated that the
GRS of 27 CHD-associated SNPs better predicted which individuals
would benefit most, both in relative and absolute terms, from statin
treatment. In a study of type 2 diabetes, Florez et al.32 has shown that
the effects of increased genetic susceptibility to disease can be ame-
liorated by lifestyle (diet and exercise) and therapeutic (metformin)
interventions. Similar possibilities exist for CHD, whereby early tar-
geted prevention strategies based on genomic CHD risk may be im-
plemented well in advance of clinical risk scores attaining predictive
capacity at later ages.33 Such early risk stratification will offer
increased efficiency in allocating both therapeutic resources and life-
style modifications with the potential for subsequent delay of onset
of traditional risk factors and incident CHD risk.
While our study demonstrates both the independent and incremen-
tal predictive power provided by our GRS, it is important to note that
even when combined with such scores, the overall positive predictive
value still remains modest for an acceptable negative predictive value
(see Supplementary material online,
Figure S14a). Furthermore, des-
pite overall improved reclassification of 10 years risk, some individuals
who went on to develop an incident event were reclassified at a lower
risk by the addition of the GRS compared with their initial classification
using a clinical score (Tables 3 and 4), emphasizing the limitations of the
current GRS. The magnitude of the GRS effect was weaker in FHS
than in the other datasets examined (FINRISK, WTCCC-CAD,
MIGen-Harps, and ARGOS; Table 2). In addition to potential technical
and clinical FHS differences discussed above, these results suggest that
the benefit and clinical utility of the GRS may vary between popula-
tions; further evaluation in large prospective studies of varying ancestry
will be required in order to assess these differences and how best to
account for them in risk prediction. In this context, it should be noted
that our GRS based on a starting list of 79 128 common SNPs tested
by the CARDIOGRAMplusC4D consortium could be further im-
proved. Future studies that construct GRSs using increased sample
sizes and capturing the full spectrum of common and rare variants9,34
will likely provide additional gains in prediction and risk stratification.
In summary, this study has demonstrated the potential clinical util-
ity of genome-scale GRS for CHD, both for early identification of in-
dividuals at increased CHD risk and for complementing existing
clinical risk scores. Given recent advances and reduced cost of geno-
typing microarrays and sequencing-based technologies and their cost
efficiency, determination of genome-wide SNP variants (including the
49 310 SNPs used here) is no longer beyond the realm of clinical ap-
plication. In terms of technical feasibility, genome-wide genotyping of
hundreds of thousands of SNPs is now both reliable and cost effect-
ive (<US$70 in bulk), and clinically certified genotyping services are
now becoming available. Statistical SNP imputation will further ex-
pand the number of SNPs to an order of several million. Additionally,
germline genotyping is a one-time cost for each individual. Further
validation and cost-benefit analyses will be required in order to estab-
lish how this technology is deployed in clinical settings.
