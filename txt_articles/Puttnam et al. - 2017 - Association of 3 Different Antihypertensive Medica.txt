for the Antihypertensive and Lipid-Lowering Treatment to Prevent Heart Attack Trial (ALLHAT) Collaborative Research Group
IMPORTANCE On the basis of observational studies, the use of thiazide diuretics for the
treatment of hypertension is associated with reduced fracture risk compared with nonuse.
Data from randomized clinical trials are lacking.
OBJECTIVE To examine whether the use of thiazide diuretics for the treatment of
hypertension is associated with reduced fracture risk compared with nonuse.
DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS Using Veterans Affairs and Medicare claims data, this
study examined hip and pelvic fracture hospitalizations in Antihypertensive and
Lipid-Lowering Treatment to Prevent Heart Attack Trial participants randomized to first-step
therapy with a thiazide-type diuretic (chlorthalidone), a calcium channel blocker (amlodipine
besylate), or an angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor (lisinopril). Recruitment was from
February 1994 to January 1998; in-trial follow-up ended in March 2002. The mean follow-up
was 4.9 years. Posttrial follow-up was conducted through the end of 2006, using passive
surveillance via national databases. For this secondary analysis, which used an
intention-to-treat approach, data were analyzed from February 1, 1994, through December
31, 2006.
MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES Hip and pelvic fracture hospitalizations.
RESULTS A total of 22 180 participants (mean [SD] age, 70.4 [6.7] years; 43.0% female; and
49.9% white non-Hispanic, 31.2% African American, and 19.1% other ethnic groups) were
followed for up to 8 years (mean [SD], 4.9 [1.5] years) during masked therapy. After trial
completion, 16 622 participants for whom claims data were available were followed for up to
5 additional years (mean [SD] total follow-up, 7.8 [3.1] years). During the trial, 338 fractures
occurred. Participants randomized to receive chlorthalidone vs amlodipine or lisinopril had
a lower risk of fracture on adjusted analyses (hazards ratio [HR], 0.79; 95% CI, 0.63-0.98;
P = .04). Risk of fracture was significantly lower in participants randomized to receive
chlorthalidone vs lisinopril (HR, 0.75; 95% CI, 0.58-0.98; P = .04) but not significantly
different compared with those randomized to receive amlodipine (HR, 0.82; 95% CI,
0.63-1.08; P = .17). During the entire trial and posttrial period of follow-up, the cumulative
incidence of fractures was nonsignificantly lower in participants randomized to receive
chlorthalidone vs lisinopril or amlodipine (HR, 0.87; 95% CI, 0.74-1.03; P = .10) and vs each
medication separately. In sensitivity analyses, when 1 year after randomization was used as
the baseline (to allow for the effects of medications on bone to take effect), similar results
were obtained for in-trial and in-trial plus posttrial follow-up.
CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE These findings from a large randomized clinical trial provide
evidence of a beneficial effect of thiazide-type diuretic therapy in reducing hip and pelvic
fracture risk compared with treatment with other antihypertensive medications.

ypertension and osteoporotic fractures are age-
relateddisorderswhoseincidencesincreaserapidlyaf-
ter the age of 65 years. The conditions are interre-
lated because people with hypertension have more
osteoporotic fractures than people without hypertension.1,2 A
meta-analysis3 revealed that many nonrandomized, observa-
tional studies suggest that therapy with thiazide-type diuret-
ics improves bone strength and reduces fracture risk. A posi-
tive effect on calcium balance and a direct stimulatory effect
on osteoblasts have been proposed as the biological basis for
thisputativebeneficialeffect.4β-Blockersmayalsoreducefrac-
ture risk5 (possibly through β2-adrenergic blockade of recep-
tors present on osteoclasts6), although a review article7 found
that not all studies confirm this. Less is known regarding the
effects of angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors (ACEis)
and calcium channel blockers (CCBs) on fracture risk despite
their ubiquitous use in older adults with hypertension.
Studies8,9 have found that ACEis exert a protective effect on
bone strength through blockade of local angiotensin produc-
tion, which stimulates osteoclast activity, and reduction of re-
ceptor activator nuclear factor–κβ ligand in osteoblasts, which
activatesosteoclasts.Severalclinicalstudiessuggestlowerfrac-
ture risk with their use,10,11 although not all studies agree.12-15
Another study16 found that CCBs decrease bone resorption
through reduced osteoclast function owing to lower cytoso-
lic calcium. Little information is available regarding their clini-
cal effect on bone health.
The Antihypertensive and Lipid-Lowering Treatment to
Prevent Heart Attack Trial (ALLHAT) was a large randomized
clinical trial that compared the effect of first-step therapy with
different classes of antihypertensive drug therapy in prevent-
ing fatal coronary heart disease (CHD) or nonfatal myocardial
infarction (primary outcome) and other cardiovascular dis-
ease (CVD) events. The CCB amlodipine, the ACEi lisinopril,
and the α-receptor blocker doxazosin mesylate were not su-
perior to the diuretic chlorthalidone in preventing the pri-
mary CHD outcome or any other major CVD or renal
outcomes.17 Chlorthalidone was superior to amlodipine, lisin-
opril, and doxazosin in preventing heart failure and to lisino-
pril (blacks only) and doxazosin in preventing stroke. The large
sample size, long follow-up, and randomized therapy pro-
vide a unique opportunity to examine post hoc the effects of
the major classes of blood pressure–lowering medications on
the incidence of hospitalizations for hip and pelvic fractures.
These fracture types are well captured in administrative data
sets and are serious fracture types that can be associated with
mortality. We asked 3 questions: Are hip and pelvic fractures
less common during treatment with a thiazide-type diuretic
compared with CCBs or ACEis? Does the addition of a β-blocker
to chlorthalidone further lower the risk of fracture? Assum-
ing a beneficial effect in the chlorthalidone group during the
trial, would this pattern continue during the posttrial period
(ie, is there a legacy effect)?
To answer these questions, we used 2 approaches. First,
we examined the cohort from the time of randomization
until the time of event (fracture) or censoring (death or end
of follow-up), thus maintaining the randomized allocation of
participants. Second, as a sensitivity analysis, we examined
the cohort beginning 1 year after the onset of the study.
Although randomization is not strictly maintained with this
approach, this was done for 2 reasons: to allow for the effect
of antihypertensive medications on bone to take place and
to avoid including early fractures associated with falls
related to use of new antihypertensive medications. Several
studies have reported increased risk of falls (a proximate
event in 90%-95% of hip fractures18) in new users of antihy-
pertensive medications.19,20 This study examines whether
the use of thiazide diuretics for the treatment of hyperten-
sion is associated with reduced fracture risk compared with
nonuse. We hypothesized fewer in-trial fracture hospitaliza-
tions in those randomized to chlorthalidone vs comparators
and that this benefit would persist into the posttrial surveil-
lance period when participants were no longer randomized
to study medications.
Methods
ALLHAT was a randomized, double-blind, active-controlled,
clinical hypertension trial that compared first-step treatment
with the thiazide-type diuretic chlorthalidone (n = 15 255), the
CCB amlodipine (n = 9048), the α-receptor blocker doxazo-
sin (n = 9061), or the ACEi lisinopril (n = 9054).21 The doxa-
zosin arm was stopped early because of a higher risk of CVD
compared with chlorthalidone and is not considered here. All
participants gave written informed consent, and all centers ob-
tained institutional review board approval for the trial. The in-
stitutional review board of The University of Texas Health Sci-
enceCenteratHoustonapprovedtheposttrialfollow-upstudy.
The authors outside the Coordinating Center did not have ac-
cess to participant-level identifying data.
Eligible participants for ALLHAT were men and women 55
years or older who had systolic blood pressure of at least 140
mm Hg and/or diastolic blood pressure of at least 90 mm Hg
or took medication for hypertension and had at least 1 addi-
tional risk factor for CHD. These risk factors included previ-
ous myocardial infarction or stroke, left ventricular hypertro-
phy by electrocardiography or echocardiography, history of
Key Points
Question Do thiazide diuretics protect against fracture risk?
Findings Use of the thiazide-like diuretic chlorthalidone was
associated with a 21% significantly lower risk of hip and pelvic
fractures compared with either lisinopril or amlodipine and a
significantly lower risk compared with lisinopril alone during
approximately 4.9 years of follow-up. During 5 additional years of
posttrial follow-up, when medication use was not constrained by
study protocol, fracture risk continued to be lower in users of
chlorthalidone compared with lisinopril or amlodipine together
or alone.
Meaning The present results of short-term and long-term fracture
protection with thiazide antihypertensive therapy compared with
other antihypertensive medications strongly recommend use of
a thiazide for hypertension treatment in addition to its long track
record of cardiovascular protection.

ings during screening.21
Medications
The step 1 study medications (chlorthalidone, 12.5-25 mg; am-
lodipine, 2.5-10 mg; and lisinopril, 10-40 mg) were formu-
latedtolookalikesothattheidentityofeachagentwasdouble-
masked. The doses were titrated to achieve a blood pressure
lower than 140/90 mm Hg. If goal blood pressure was not
achieved using the maximum tolerated dose, open-label step
2 (reserpine, clonidine, or atenolol) or step 3 (hydralazine)
medications could be added.
Recruitment and Follow-up
Recruitment was from February 1, 1994, through January 31,
1998; in-trial follow-up ended March 31, 2002. The mean (SD)
follow-up was 4.9 (1.5) years. Posttrial follow-up was con-
ducted through the end of 2006, using passive surveillance via
national databases.22
Hip and Pelvic Fracture Cohorts
Fracture data were ascertained through the Centers for Medi-
care & Medicaid Services and Veterans Affairs (VA) hospital-
izationdatafromFebruary1,1994,throughDecember31,2006,
for beneficiaries with valid Medicare or Social Security iden-
tifiers.Participantsyoungerthan65yearsatrandomizationen-
rolledbynon-VAclinicsandparticipantsfromCanadawerenot
included because they would not have had continuous cov-
erage in either data source. The VA data files were not avail-
able for the posttrial follow-up (2002-2006); therefore, the
posttrial cohort was limited to US citizens with Medicare Part
A insurance at randomization (Figure 1). Hospitalized hip and
pelvic fractures (International Classification of Diseases, Ninth
Revision, codes 820.x and 808.x, respectively) were chosen as
endpointsbecausetheyarealmostalwaysassociatedwithhos-
pitalization. Such ascertainment results in less underestima-
tion of hip fracture incidence than methods based on
self-report.23 For each participant, the time to first fracture was
calculated for the maximal period of follow-up from base-
line. For sensitivity analyses, the incidence of fractures was
calculated beginning 1 year after study enrollment.
Statistical Analysis
Data are summarized as means (SDs) for continuous variables
and numbers (percentages) of study participants for categori-
cal variables. Baseline characteristics were compared across
the treatment groups using 2-tailed, unpaired t tests for con-
tinuous variables and χ2 contingency table analyses for cat-
egorical variables.
Atenolol use was not ascertained at baseline. Because par-
ticipants who were already taking atenolol at baseline were al-
lowed to continue to take atenolol and atenolol was a step 2
drug, participants taking atenolol at the first follow-up visit
(1 month) were assumed to be taking atenolol at baseline.

equations.24 Both estimations were used because outcomes
vary, and we wished to capture any possible diminished re-
nal function (eGFR <60 mL/min/1.73 m2).
Outcomes analysis used an intention-to-treat approach.
Fracture rates and graphs used the Kaplan-Meier method. The
Cox proportional hazards regression model was used to de-
terminehazardratios(HRs)and95%CIs.Individualswerecen-
sored for outcomes if they died, had no outcome in the data-
base by the end of the study, or were lost to follow-up.
Proportional hazards were tested by including a time × treat-
ment variable in the Cox proportional hazards regression mod-
els and found to hold. Adjusted Cox proportional hazards re-
gression models included age, race, sex, diabetes, eGFR,
prevalent CVD, body mass index, and smoking. For the pri-
mary analyses, we combined those separately assigned to am-
lodipine and lisinopril into 1 group for greater statistical power.
Separate comparisons of amlodipine and lisinopril to chlortha-
lidone were conducted as secondary analyses.
Heterogeneity of treatment effects on outcomes was ex-
amined using treatment-variable interaction terms in Cox pro-

Results
A total of 22 180 participants (mean [SD] age, 70.4 [6.7]
years; 43.0% female; and 49.9% white non-Hispanic, 31.2%
African American, and 19.1% other ethnic groups) were fol-
lowed up for as long as 8 years (mean [SD], 4.9 [1.5] years)
during masked therapy. After trial completion, 16 622 par-
ticipants for whom claims data were available were followed
up for as long as 5 additional years (mean [SD] total follow-
up, 7.8 [3.1] years). The in-trial cohort consisted of partici-
pants randomized to chlorthalidone, amlodipine, or lisino-
pril, with or without atenolol at month 1 of follow-up from
baseline (Figure 1A). Of 33 357 participants, 22 180 (66.5%)
were in the Medicare or the VA system databases. Details of
the cohort (n = 16 622) with in-trial and posttrial follow-up
are shown in Figure 1B. Baseline characteristics of the 2
cohorts are given in eTable 1 and eTable 2 in the Supple-
ment. The groups were equally balanced in all aspects
except that in-trial participants randomized to receive
chlorthalidone had more baseline CHD than the amlodipine
and lisinopril groups (29.3% vs 27.8%, P < .05). Figure 2
shows the cumulative fracture rates for both cohorts.

In-Trial Cohort
Thirty-four participants had pelvic fractures and 307 partici-
pants had hip fractures during the in-trial period (mean [SD]
follow-up, 4.9 [1.5] years). Three of these individuals had both
hip and pelvic fractures. Cumulative fracture rates and HRs are
given in the Table and Figure 2A. In unadjusted analyses, par-
ticipants randomized to receive chlorthalidone had signifi-
cantly decreased risk (HR, 0.78; 95% CI, 0.63-0.97; P = .03) of
fractures compared with those randomized to receive lisino-
pril or amlodipine. The increased risk appeared by the sec-
ond year after randomization for those taking amlodipine or
lisinopril.Similarresultswerenotedafteradjustmentfordemo-
graphic and clinical variables (HR, 0.79; 95% CI, 0.63-0.98;
P = .04). Similar trends were found when chlorthalidone use
was compared with lisinopril or amlodipine use separately
(eFigure 1 in the Supplement). Chlorthalidone use was asso-
ciated with a significantly lower risk of fracture compared with
lisinopril use (HR, 0.75; 95% CI, 0.58-0.98; P = .04), whereas
the risk with amlodipine use was not statistically significant
(HR, 0.82; 95% CI, 0.63-1.08; P = .15).
The potential effect of atenolol use on fracture risk in par-
ticipants taking chlorthalidone during the in-trial period is pre-
sented in eTable 3 and eFigure 2 in the Supplement. No sig-
nificant difference was found between those taking or not
taking atenolol. The unadjusted HR for atenolol users was 1.43
(95% CI, 0.67-3.07). Adjustment for demographic and clini-
cal variables marginally changed this estimate (HR, 1.29; 95%
CI, 0.56-2.95).
Fully adjusted hip and pelvic fracture HRs, stratified by se-
lected variables, are shown for the in-trial cohort in Figure 3
and eFigure 3 in the Supplement. In all instances, use of
chlorthalidone was associated with a lower risk of fracture
than amlodipine or lisinopril. In several instances, the use of
chlorthalidone was associated with a significantly lower risk
(eGFR ≥60 mL/min/1.73 m2 using the Modification of Diet in
Renal Disease formula, age ≥65 years, race other than black,
and overweight). Interaction terms were not statistically sig-
nificant (with P values ranging from .16 to .99). Similar find-
ings were present when lisinopril or amlodipine use vs
chlorthalidone use was examined separately (eFigure 3 in the
Supplement), with a higher fracture risk in more subgroups
treated with lisinopril (Modification of Diet in Renal Disease
eGFR >60 mL/min/1.73 m2, prevalent CVD, male sex, age >65
years, race other than black) compared with amlodipine (over-
weight).

than in the in-trial cohort, likely because of the older age of
the cohort with extended follow-up. No significant differ-
ence was found in the risk of fractures between those random-
ized to receive chlorthalidone vs those randomized to receive
amlodipine or lisinopril (unadjusted HR, 0.87; 95% CI, 0.74-
1.02; P = .09; adjusted HR, 0.87; 95% CI, 0.74-1.03; P = .10), al-
though users of chlorthalidone had persistently nonsignifi-
cantly lower risk after year 3 of follow-up. When fracture risk
was examined by amlodipine or lisinopril use vs chlorthali-
done use separately (eFigure 1 in the Supplement), no signifi-
cant differences were found between use of lisinopril or am-
lodipine vs chlorthalidone use (chlorthalidone vs amlodipine:
unadjusted HR, 0.85; 95% CI, 0.70-1.02; P = .08; ad-
justed HR, 0.87; 95% CI, 0.71-1.09; P = .16; chlorthalidone vs
lisinopril: unadjusted HR, 0.90; 95% CI, 0.75-1.08; P = .28; ad-
justed HR, 0.87; 95% CI, 0.71-1.09; P = .17), although chlortha-
lidone use was associated with a lower risk of fracture.
Sensitivity Analyses
Analyses were repeated beginning 1 year after randomization
to gauge the effects of the medications on fracture risk after
trial participants had been exposed to the bone effects of the
medications for 1 year. In the in-trial cohort, 21 721 (65%) of the
33 357participantsintheMedicareorVAsystemdatabasessur-
vived 1 year after randomization. There were 16 263 with in-
trial and posttrial follow-up.
During the in-trial period (mean [SD] follow-up, 3.8 [1.6]
years), 32 participants had a pelvic fracture and 266 had a hip
fracture. In the cohort with in-trial and posttrial follow-up, 69
pelvic and 545 hip fractures occurred during the in-trial and
posttrial periods. The in-trial and the in-trial plus posttrial re-
sults 1 year after randomization (Figure 2C and D) were simi-
lar to the in-trial and in-trial plus posttrial results from the time
of randomization (Figure 2A and B).
Discussion
This post hoc analysis of an older cohort randomly assigned
to3classesoffirst-stepantihypertensivemedicationhas2main
findings. First, the risk of hip and pelvic fractures during in-
trial follow-up was lowest in participants assigned to first-
step therapy with chlorthalidone compared with amlodipine
or lisinopril. This finding was consistent in all subgroup com-
parisons. Similar results were obtained in sensitivity analy-
ses, where the first year of follow-up after randomization was
excluded. To our knowledge, this analysis provides the first
randomized comparison of different antihypertensive medi-
cations on risk of hip or pelvic fractures. Consistent with our
findings, a meta-analysis3 of 21 case-control and cohort stud-
ies concluded that treatment with thiazide diuretics was as-
sociated with a 24% lower risk of hip fracture compared with
other antihypertensive agents (HR, 0.76; 95% CI, 0.64-0.89).
Second, analyses that included in-trial and posttrial fol-
low-up yielded a fracture risk that was no longer significantly
different between the treatment groups, albeit it was still nu-
merically lowest in the chlorthalidone group. Our analyses
based on posttrial and in-trial experience were not based on a

randomized comparison and thus are subject to bias. More-
over, during the posttrial period, the choice of blood pressure
medication was no longer constrained by the study protocol;
therefore, those originally randomized to receive chlorthali-
done might have stopped using this medication and non-
chlorthalidone users might have begun to take a thiazide di-
uretic. A population study25 found that thiazide diuretic
use increased in the United States after publication of the
ALLHAT results. Despite these caveats, participants random-
ized to receive chlorthalidone during the in-trial period contin-
ued to have a lower point estimate of fracture risk 5 years after
study completion, suggesting (but not proving) a legacy ef-
fect.Suchafindingisatoddswith2otherstudies.18,26Inastudy
of healthy women early in menopause,26 use of a thiazide di-
uretic for 2 years prevented loss of bone mineral density (BMD)
in the forearm compared with placebo. One year after the thia-
zide use was stopped, there was no difference in BMD com-
pared with the placebo group, suggesting rapid loss of the ben-
eficialeffectofthediuretic.TheRotterdamstudy18reportedthat
the presumed hip fracture protective effect of thiazides disap-
peared 4 months after discontinuation of diuretic therapy.
When we examined the in-trial fracture risk in users of
lisinopril and amlodipine separately, we found a significantly
higherriskinthoserandomizedtoreceivelisinoprilbutnotam-
lodipinecomparedwithchlorthalidone.Thisfindingcontradicts
thepositiveeffectsthatACEisarebelievedtoexertonbonephysi-

studies.12-15,27 A 4-year observational study27 from Hong Kong
foundthatcontinuoususeofACEiscomparedwithnonusewas
associatedwithgreaterBMDlossinthetotalhipandfemoralneck
in women. In a prospective cohort study12 of 5995 older men
fromtheOsteoporoticFracturesinMenStudy,with4.6yearsof
follow-up,continuoususeofACEiscomparedwithnonusewas
associated with a small but significantly higher loss of BMD in
the trochanter and total hip. Increased BMD loss with ACEi use
vs nonuse was noted in a Japanese cohort.13 In a study of Medi-
caredata,14thenumberofhipfractureswas approximately14%
higher in users of ACEis compared with thiazide diuretics, al-
though the HR was not statistically significant. In the Study of
Women’
sHealthAcrosstheNation,15thiazideusewasassociated
withlessannualizedBMDlosscomparedwithnonusersandcom-

widespread use of ACEis for the treatment of hypertension in
olderadults,ourfindinghaspotentiallyimportantpublichealth

Inourstudy,theβ-blockeratenololdidnotseemtoactsyn-
ergistically with chlorthalidone to yield a lower fracture risk.
In fact, use of atenolol together with chlorthalidone was as-
sociatedwithanonsignificantlyincreasedriskoffracturecom-
paredwithuseofchlorthalidonealone.Giventhatatenololwas
used as an add-on medication in ALLHAT, this finding should
be viewed with a great deal of caution.
This study has important strengths. We were able to ex-
aminetreatmenteffectsforanextendedperiod.Ourcohortwas
large and well characterized, allowing adjustment for vari-
ables that affect bone health. Our sample was based on par-
ticipants who had been randomized to their treatment group,
minimizing differences between the treatment groups.
Limitations
Study weaknesses should also be acknowledged. First, analy-
ses, although performed in a randomized setting, were con-
ducted post hoc, and results are subject to unmeasured bias.
Second, participation in ALLHAT excluded several groups
of participants at high risk for fracture, such as those with ac-
tive coronary artery disease and heart failure10,28 and chronic
kidney disease.29 Our results cannot be extrapolated to these
groups. In addition, as in many large trials, only variables that
were important to the primary goal of the study were col-
lected; thus, we lacked covariates such as menstrual history
(women), testosterone levels (men), history of falls (a proxi-
mate event in most hip and pelvic fractures), and bisphospho-
nate use. We note that alendronate, the first approved
bisphosphonate, was approved by the US Food and Drug Ad-
ministration in late 1995, approximately 18 months after the
onset of ALLHAT. It would have become available in the mar-
ket 6 months later at the earliest. Therefore, bisphosphonate
use would not have influenced the early in-trial results of
ALLHAT. Moreover, the use of bisphosphonates became com-
mon only in the early 2000s, after the release of several large
fracture trials.30 Thus, it is unlikely that the in-trial fracture
rate was strongly influenced by the use of these agents. In ad-
dition, it is unlikely that bisphosphonate use would differ by
randomized treatment arm.
Third, we relied on databases (rather than medical rec-
ords) to ascertain fracture occurrence. Although this ap-
proach is highly accurate for diagnosing fractures,23 partici-
pants eligible for Medicare who were enrolled in managed care
would not have hospitalizations recorded with Medicare,
thereby lowering the number of participants with fractures.
In ALLHAT, approximately 20% of Medicare eligible patients
were in managed care at some point during follow-up and thus
were not eligible to have hospitalization records in the data-
base; 8% (40% of participants with managed care indicators)
did not have such indicators in the CMS database until the last
2 years of posttrial follow-up (2005 and 2006).
Fourth, although randomization was generally well main-
tained during the trial period, there was crossover of medica-
tion use.17 Among all participants, 80.5% of the chlorthali-
done, 80.4% of the amlodipine, and 72.6% of the lisinopril
groups were taking their assigned medications (or one in an
equivalent class) at their 5-year follow-up visit. Among all par-
ticipants, 9.0% of the chlorthalidone group were taking a CCB
or an ACEi without a diuretic at 5 years; 23.5% of the amlo-
dipine group and 24.2% of the lisinopril group were taking a
diuretic with or without their assigned study medications at
5 years. Such crossover would tend to decrease differences in
fracture outcomes between medication classes.
