 Can environmental improvement change
the population distribution of walking?
Jenna Panter, David Ogilvie, on behalf of the iConnect consortium
ABSTRACT
Background Few studies have explored the impact of
environmental change on walking using controlled
comparisons. Even fewer have examined whose
behaviour changes and how. In a natural experimental
study of new walking and cycling infrastructure, we
explored changes in walking, identified groups who
changed in similar ways and assessed whether exposure
to the infrastructure was associated with trajectories of
walking.
Methods 1257 adults completed annual surveys
assessing walking, sociodemographic and health
characteristics and use of the infrastructure (2010–
2012). Residential proximity to the new routes was
assessed objectively. We used latent growth curve
models to assess change in total walking, walking for
recreation and for transport, used simple descriptive
analysis and latent class analysis (LCA) to identify groups
who changed in similar ways and examined factors
associated with group membership using multinomial
regression.
Results LCA identified five trajectories, characterised by
consistently low levels; consistently high levels;
decreases; short-lived increases; and sustained increases.
Those with lower levels of education and lower incomes
were more likely to show both short-lived and sustained
increases in walking for transport. However, those with
lower levels of education were less likely to take up
walking. Proximity to the intervention was associated
with both uptake of and short-lived increases in walking
for transport.
Conclusions Environmental improvement encouraged
the less active to take up walking for transport, as well
as encouraging those who were already active to walk
more. Further research should disentangle the role of
socioeconomic characteristics in determining use of new
environments and changes in walking.
INTRODUCTION
Epidemiological evidence supports an association
between physical activity and lower risk of diabetes,
cardiovascular disease and mortality,1 2 but many
people remain insufficiently active.3 Public health
advocacy increasingly focuses on everyday activities
such as
walking
as a target
for
intervention.
W
alking can be incorporated into everyday life rela-
tively easily and if performed at moderate pace
meets the definition of moderate intensity activity.4
Modifying environments to make walking easier
could produce widely distributed and sustained
effects.5–7
Robust evidence on the impact of environmental
changes on activity levels is beginning to emerge,
but many existing studies have significant limita-
tions
in
conceptualising
and
defining
exposed
populations8 and constructing controlled compari-
sons,9 or are limited by relatively short follow-up
periods or imprecise measures of activity.5 6 Some
studies report no effect of environmental changes
on time spent in activity,10 despite the fact that new
or modified environments are well used. Others
report a relatively small mean change in activity,
which may mask substantial changes in some indivi-
duals.11
These
observations
beg
the
question
whether these interventions have encouraged those
who were already active to do more, or have
encouraged the less active to take up new activity.
Understanding how different population groups
respond to interventions is essential for assessing
their overall impacts on health and health inequal-
ities, and for the design and targeting of future
interventions. Adopting and maintaining health
behaviours, such as walking, is a process that
evolves over time12 and is therefore best under-
stood using data from multiple time points.
Connect2 was a programme of engineering pro-
jects that aimed to make local walking and cycling
journeys easier by constructing or improving routes
at sites around the UK.13 The before-and-after
evaluation
of
the
Connect2
projects
in
Southampton, Kenilworth and Cardiff found that
living closer to the new infrastructure was asso-
ciated with increases in walking, cycling and overall
physical activity at 2-year follow-up.11 Previous
analysis14 concluded that the new routes were
mostly used for walking, which therefore forms the
behavioural focus for the more detailed analysis
described in this paper. W
e aimed to describe
changes in walking in the sample, identify groups
of participants whose walking behaviour changed
in similar ways and investigate the extent to which
walking group membership differed by sociodemo-
graphic or health characteristics or exposure to the
intervention.
METHODS: INTERVENTION
Connect2 projects were located at 79 sites in the
UK. Each project included a core component, such
as a bridge over a busy road, railway or river,
together with the development or improvement of
feeder routes. Interventions of this kind are often
described by researchers as natural experiments,
and this provided an opportunity to generate evi-
dence about impacts. The independent iConnect
study
(http://www.iconnect.ac.uk)
set
out
to
measure and evaluate the travel, physical activity
and carbon impacts of the Connect2 programme.
Sites were selected for evaluation based on seven
criteria, including implementation timetable and
likelihood
of
measurable
population
impact.13

 evaluation: (1) Cardiff, where a traffic-free bridge was built over
Cardiff Bay; (2) Kenilworth, where a traffic-free bridge was built
over a busy trunk road; and (3) Southampton, where an infor-
mal riverside footpath was turned into a boardwalk.
Participants and procedures
Detailed description of methods of the data collection has been
reported elsewhere.13 Briefly, questionnaires were posted to
22 500 adults who were listed on the edited electoral register
and lived within 5 km by road of the Connect2 projects in
Kenilworth, Cardiff and Southampton in April 2010. In total,
3516 individuals returned the questionnaires at baseline and
1304 (37% of baseline) returned the follow-up questionnaires
in April 2011 and April 2012.
MEASURES
Walking
As the correlates of walking for transport and recreation dif-
fered15 and double counting of activity seemed unlikely in this
study,16 we examined total walking, as well as in walking for
transport and for recreation which were assessed at both time
points. W
alking for transport was assessed using a 7-day recall
instrument covering journeys made for commuting, on business,
for study, for shopping and personal business, and for social
activities. Participants reported the total weekly time spent
walking for each purpose and these totals were summed. They
also reported the total time spent walking for recreation in the
past week using an adapted version of the short form of the
International Physical Activity Questionnaire.17 Total time spent
walking was the sum of the times spent walking for transport
and for recreation. The test–retest reliability and convergent val-
idity of our short IPAQ are comparable to those of other ques-
tionnaires, including the unmodified short IPAQ.17 Changes in
total time spent walking, walking for transport and for recre-
ation were computed (2012 minus 2010).
Sociodemographic and health characteristics
Demographic (sex, age, ethnicity and presence of any child
under 16 in the household), socioeconomic (highest educational
level, annual household income and employment status) and
health characteristics (height, weight, general health and pres-
ence of long-term illness or disability limiting daily activities)
were self-reported in 2010. Height and weight were used to
compute body mass index and assign weight status.18 Baseline
characteristics were used as covariates in the analysis; these are
more plausible determinants of behaviour than characteristics
assessed at follow-up, and using multiple time-varying character-
istics would have resulted in complex and unstable models.
Exposure to and use of the intervention
As in our previous work, proximity to the Connect2 interven-
tion was used to operationalise different degrees of exposure to
make controlled comparisons in natural experimental studies.
W
e assessed proximity using the shortest road network distance
between each participant’s home and the nearest Connect2
access point. Those living closer were deemed more highly
exposed than those living further away. In 2011 and 2012, par-
ticipants also reported if they had walked or cycled on their
local Connect2 route for transport or recreation.
Analysis
Only participants with complete data at all three time points
were included in analysis. W
e excluded those who moved home,
or who reported changes in walking of >15 hours/week in any
one-year period (which might reflect misreporting 15 min as
15 hours). W
e used Mplus software V
.7.11 for analysis 1 and 2
and Stata V
.13.0 for analysis 3. In analysis 1 and 2, weekly
minutes of walking were converted to hours to reduce the vari-
ance and improve the stability of the models. Further details are
given in online supplementary additional file 1.
Analysis 1: describing average changes in the sample
W
e used latent growth curve models (LGCMs)19 to describe the
average change in the sample over time and the between-person
differences around the average by fitting unconditional models.
Analysis 2: identifying groups whose walking behaviour
changed in similar ways
W
e used two methods to identify groups whose walking beha-
viour changed in similar ways, reclassifying those reporting
<30 min per week as ‘minimal walking’ to reduce the noise of
measurement error. W
e choose the 30 min/week threshold
because this reflected a natural grouping in the data. First, we
used a simple binary classification of time spent walking at each
time point (0: ‘minimal’—<30 min vs 1: ‘meaningful’—30 min
or more) and identified all possible patterns of change over time
(eg, 0-1-1: those who took up behaviour and 1-0-0: those who
gave up behaviour). Second, we used latent class analysis
(LCA)18 to identify subpopulations of individuals that were not
directly observed, but inferred from multiple observations. This
technique has been applied to studying trajectories of obesity20
and physical activity,21 and the impact of interventions on
weight loss22 and general health.23 In LCA we used weekly
hours spent walking, allowing within-individual variation within
classes through the use of the INTEGRATION function; we
also
used
categorical
assessments
of
<30 min/week,
30–
150 min/week and >150 min/week, corresponding to recom-
mended levels of physical activity.1 In both approaches, we
began with a one-class model equivalent to the null hypothesis
that all participants followed the same trajectory. W
e then tested
increasing numbers of classes and estimated the probability of
each participant belonging to each class.
Analysis 3: correlates of group membership
After identifying the optimal number of groups, participants
were assigned to the group for which they had the highest prob-
ability of membership. W
e examined whether sociodemo-
graphic, health characteristics and exposure to the intervention
were associated with groups derived from simple group classifi-
cations and LCA, using logistic and multinomial logistic regres-
sion models adjusted for age, sex and intervention site.
Sensitivity analyses
W
e repeated analyses 2 and 3 using raw values of time spent
walking without the reclassification of <30 min/week walking as
‘minimal’.
RESULTS
Study sample and participant characteristics
Of the 1304 participants who returned the questionnaires at all
three time points, 1258 and 1266 provided data on walking for
transport and for recreation, respectively, and had neither
moved home nor reported an extreme change in walking. There
were no major differences between participants included in and
those excluded from the analysis, (defined above) and few dif-
ferences between the sample used here and that used in the pre-
vious evaluation (table 1).11

 Analysis 1: describing average changes
The median total time spent walking decreased slightly between
2010 and 2012 from 2.8 to 2.5 hours/week (p=0.35) and this
was mostly explained by a decrease in walking for transport (see
online supplementary additional file A2, table SA1), but there
were
some
large
within-person
changes
(see
online
supplementary additional file A2 and figure SA1). In simple
LGCMs, we fixed the slope factor loadings at 0, 1 and 2 for
2010, 2011 and 2012. W
e tested whether the average popula-
tion change was linear by freeing the slope parameter for 2011.
If change was constant between 2010 and 2012, the estimated
values for 2011 should have been close to 1, matching a linear
change over a 1-year period. The freed slope parameter for
total walking was 1.3 (SE: 2.57), indicating that the average
change between 2010 and 2011 was slightly greater than that
between 2011 and 2012. The model fit and parameters for
LGCMs with fixed and freed slopes were generally similar
(those for total walking are shown in table 2). The mean slope
of the growth lines showed no significant overall change over
time; however, individuals differed in their baseline levels of
walking and their rate of change over time (as indicated by stat-
istically
significant
intercept
and
slope
variances,
both
p<0.001). Participants with higher levels of walking at baseline
were more likely to report a decrease over time, as indicated by
the negative intercept–slope correlation.
Analysis 2: identifying groups
Simple binary descriptive analysis illustrated that those who
reported some walking at all time points (39–42%) formed the
largest group, whereas smaller numbers of people either took
up
walking
from
scratch
or
gave
it
up
(<16%;
online
supplementary additional file 2, figure SA2).
In LCA, for all measures of walking the models with four and
five classes produced the best improvements in model fit statis-
tics, entropy and class size (table 3). W
e chose the five-class
model because it better distinguished groups reporting lower
levels of activity, which represented a large number of partici-
pants. Results using the categorical measures of change, and the
unreclassified continuous measures of time by way of sensitivity
analysis are shown in online supplementary additional file 2,
table SA2.
The five distinct trajectories were characterised by consistently
low,
consistently
high,
sustained
decreases
in,
short-lived
increases in and sustained increases in levels of walking.
Estimated growth curves for each class are shown in figure 1.
Across the three outcomes, the shapes of trajectories were
similar and the group with consistently low levels of walking
was always the largest. Membership of classes based on walking
for transport and walking for recreation was strongly related
(χ2=165.4, p<0.001); but the separation of the classes was
good, as shown by the entropy scores and the correlation

additional file 2, table SA3 and table SA4).
Analysis 3: correlates of group membership
W
e focused on understanding the characteristics of those who
demonstrated
either
short-lived
or
sustained
increases
in
walking for transport or for recreation (identified in LCA), and
of those who took up either behaviour, as these outcomes are
associated with potential health gain (and the trajectories for
total time spent walking were very similar). For the analysis of
increases in walking, participants whose levels of walking
remained consistently low formed the reference group (total n:
walking for recreation=1115; walking for transport=1105).
For the analysis of uptake of walking, those who never walked
formed the reference group (total n: 383, 394 respectively).
Sample sizes are given in online supplementary additional file 2,
table SA5.
Both short-lived and sustained increases in, and uptake of,
walking were socioeconomically patterned (table 4). Compared
to those who reported consistently low levels of walking for
transport, participants who reported short-lived or sustained
increases were more likely to have lower household incomes,
lower levels of education and no access to a car. However, the
findings for uptake of walking were the opposite. Those with
lower levels of education were less likely to take up walking for
recreation or transport, and those with lower incomes were less
likely to take up walking for recreation. Those who were obese,
reported fair or poor general health, or had a limiting long-term
condition were also less likely to take up walking.
In adjusted multivariable models, participants living closer to
the Connect2 routes were more likely than those living further
away to show a short-lived increase in walking for transport or
to take it up. Use of Connect2 was also associated with uptake
of, and short-lived and sustained increases in, walking; these
associations were strongest for short-lived increases in walking
for transport and uptake of walking for recreation. Results for

DISCUSSION
Principal findings
W
e employed simple descriptive and LCA approaches to identify
groups whose walking behaviour changed in similar ways over
2 years using data from a natural experimental study of new
transport infrastructure. Five distinct trajectories were identified
from LCA, characterised by consistently low, consistently high,
sustained decreases in, short-lived increases in and sustained
increases in levels of walking. There were socioeconomic differ-
ences between the groups identified with these trajectories.
Residential proximity to the intervention, which was not socio-
economically patterned, was independently associated with both
short-lived increases in and uptake of walking for transport.
Strengths and limitations
W
e sought to generate more robust evidence on who benefits
from environmental interventions, as recommended in previous
guidance, through population-based sampling, the use of three
intervention sites and use of controlled comparisons.5 6 In con-
trast to simpler methods of assessing change, for example, by
calculating absolute change11 or categorising individuals into
groups whose activity increased or decreased,24 our analysis
more fully exploited the longitudinal nature of the data, includ-
ing the sequence and timing of changes. W
e used complemen-
tary approaches to understand who changed and how, using a
combination of theoretically important groupings as well as
those that emerged in the course of analysis. W
e used three
repeated measures which is the minimum number necessary for
LCA,19 but four or more would have enabled us to explore the
possibility of a wider range of trajectories, including fitting pie-
cewise models.

 Measures of both exposure and outcome were specific to the
intervention, including purpose-specific measures of use of the
infrastructure. Although the iConnect study had a comparatively
low response rate, this is not unusual in natural experimental
studies of this kind.25 The cohort was slightly older and health-
ier than the local populations,11 but comparable in many other
characteristics, although our sample cannot be assumed to repre-
sentative. Further studies need to be undertaken to assess the
effects in other populations and contexts. Changes in walking
may have occurred for a range of reasons, some unrelated to the
intervention. Although we excluded people who moved home,
we had limited data on other life events, such as pregnancy,
which might have influenced levels of walking. Future research
might
further
explore
the
role
of
such
time-varying
characteristics.
Patterns and trajectories in walking
Changes in physical activity are often short-term, and little is
known about the sustainability of changes in everyday activities
such as walking. In this sample, we observed a small average
decline in walking over time. On average, those with higher
levels of walking at baseline were more likely to report declines
and four of the five trajectories we identified were characterised
by high initial levels of walking. As the median time spent
walking in the sample was relatively high, this may reflect
regression to the mean26 whereby extreme scores on one
measure become less extreme over time.
W
e also found evidence that change in time spent walking
was not linear, in that the average change between 2010 and
2011 was greater than that between 2011 and 2012. Our LCA
did not identify a group corresponding to this pattern of
change, which suggests that the overall average pattern conceals
several divergent underlying groups. In fact in the group who
demonstrated a sustained increase in walking we observed the
opposite pattern, with the larger increase occurring in the
second interval (between 2011 and 2012). The fact that expos-
ure to the intervention was associated with sustained increases
in walking supports the findings of other studies11 27 28 which
suggest that the effect of environmental interventions on phys-
ical activity patterns may take some time to emerge.
Previous
research
has
indicated
that
walking
is
socio-
economically patterned,29 and we found further support for
this. Measures of socioeconomic status were associated with
changes in walking for transport and for recreation, in opposite
directions; these associations were explained by baseline differ-
ences in walking levels. The groups who demonstrated increases
in walking for transport started from relatively high baseline
levels, which may reflect limited choice in their transport
options. Unsurprisingly, therefore, these trajectories were asso-
ciated with lower levels of education and income and with lack
of access to a car. In our analysis of uptake of walking, in con-
trast, we compared groups who reported minimal walking at
baseline but differed in their subsequent trajectories. Here, we
found that participants with lower levels of education or income
were less likely to take up walking during the study, a pattern
consistent with the literature on inequalities in walking.29
Implications and future research
People who were more exposed to the new infrastructure were
more likely to take up, or to demonstrate a short-lived increase
in, walking for transport and exposure to the intervention was
not socioeconomically patterned. Interventions like Connect2
might, therefore, be concluded to encourage initiation of
walking. The fact that these routes were visible and are
described as ‘living landmarks’ may in part explain the success
of Connect2.30 Although we also treated ‘use’ of the infrastruc-
ture as an additional measure of exposure, this entails a degree
of circularity because use of the infrastructure necessarily
involves the behavioural outcome of interest.31 In this sense our
finding that use was consistently associated with increases in
walking, whereas proximity was associated with short-term but
not with sustained increases in walking, raises the possibility
that while environmental improvements of this kind may
encourage initiation, they may be insufficient for promoting
maintenance
of
new
behaviours
without
addressing
other
factors such as social support. This contrasts with longitudinal
evidence from an Australian observational study.32 Given the
socioeconomic inequalities in walking and the characteristics of
early and late adopters of such interventions,14 one priority for
future research should be to disentangle the pathways by which
interventions work (or do not work) for different groups.
What is already known on this subject
▸ Modifying environments to make walking easier could produce
sustained effects that are widely distributed in the population.
There is now a growing set of evaluative studies assessing the
impact of changes to the environment on walking.
▸ It is unknown whether these interventions have encouraged
those who were already active to do more or whether the
inactive are taking up activity.
▸ Understanding which population groups increase their
physical activity is essential for assessing the health impacts
of interventions and the impact on health inequalities.
What this study adds
▸ We identified five groups who changed their walking in
similar ways and we found that membership of these groups
was socioeconomically patterned.
▸ Proximity to the intervention was associated with short-lived
increases in and uptake of walking for transport. These
measures of proximity were not socioeconomically
patterned.
▸ This suggests that supportive environments may help
initiate, but not maintain behaviour change.
