Abstract
Background—Inotuzumab ozogamicin, an anti-CD22 antibody conjugated to calicheamicin, is 
active in acute lymphoblastic leukemia.
Methods—In this phase 3 trial, adults with relapsed/refractory acute lymphoblastic leukemia 
were randomized to inotuzumab ozogamicin or standard intensive chemotherapy. Primary 
endpoints were complete remission and overall survival.
Results—Primary intent-to-treat (ITT) analysis of complete remission included the first 218 
(inotuzumab ozogamicin, n=109; standard, n=109) of 326 patients randomized. Complete 
remission rate was significantly better with inotuzumab ozogamicin (80.7% [95% CI, 72%–88%] 
vs 29.4% [21%–39%]; P<0.001), as was minimal residual disease (MRD)-negativity among 
responders (78.4% [68%–87%] vs 28.1% [14%–47%]; P<0.001); remission duration was longer 
(median, 4.6 [3.9–5.4] vs 3.1 [1.4–4.9] months; hazard ratio=0.55 [0.31–0.96], P=0.034). More

 patients proceeded to transplant with inotuzumab ozogamicin (41%) versus standard (11%; 
P<0.001). In the ITT survival analysis (n=326), progression-free survival was significantly longer 
with inotuzumab ozogamicin vs standard (HR, 0.45 [97.5% CI, 0.34–0.61]; P<0.001; median, 5.0 
[95% CI, 3.7–5.6] vs 1.8 [1.5–2.2] months). The overall survival HR was 0.77 (97.5% CI, 0.58–
1.03); P=0.04; median was 7.7 (95% CI, 6.0–9.2) vs 6.7 (4.9–8.3) months. 2-year overall survival 
rate was 23% (95% CI, 16%–30%) vs 10% (5%–16%). In the safety population, the most frequent 
nonhematologic inotuzumab ozogamicin treatment-emergent grade ≥3 adverse events were liver-
related. Any grade veno-occlusive liver disease occurred in 15 (11%) patients receiving 
inotuzumab ozogamicin.
Conclusion—Patients receiving inotuzumab ozogamicin versus standard care achieved higher 
response, MRD-negativity rates, and prolonged progression-free survival and overall survival. 
Veno-occlusive disease was a major non-hematologic toxicity.

Introduction
An estimated 2650 adults in the United States were newly diagnosed with acute lymphocytic 
leukemia (ALL) in 2015; the prognosis of these patients remains poor.1 Current therapies for 
adults with newly diagnosed B-cell ALL result in complete remission (CR) rates of 60% to 
90%.2–9 However, many of these patients will relapse and only about 30% to 50% will 
achieve long-term disease-free survival lasting ≥3 years.5–9 Current standard chemotherapy 
regimens in adult relapsed/refractory B-cell ALL are associated with CR rates of 31% to 
44% in first salvage of early relapses and 18% to 25% in second salvage.10–13 Because CR 
typically is a prerequisite for subsequent allogeneic stem cell transplant, few (5%–30%) of 
these patients are eligible for bridging to transplant,10–12,14 which is considered to be the 
main goal of postrelapse treatment as the only potentially curative treatment option.10,11
The cell surface glycoprotein CD22 is expressed in most (>90%) patients with B-cell ALL, 
is not shed into the extracellular matrix,15–20 and has emerged as an attractive therapeutic 
target in B-cell malignancies.21–23 Inotuzumab ozogamicin (CMC-544) is a humanized anti-
CD22 monoclonal antibody conjugated to calicheamicin, a cytotoxic antibiotic.24–26 Upon 
binding to CD22, the CD22-conjugate complex is rapidly internalized and calicheamicin is 
released to bind to the minor groove of DNA and induce double-strand cleavage with 
subsequent apoptosis.24,26–29 A previous phase 2 study of single-dose InO administered on 
either a weekly or monthly schedule for the treatment of patients with relapsed/refractory B-
cell ALL demonstrated antitumor activity.30 Herein, we present results of the ongoing 
global, phase 3 INO-VATE ALL study, assessing the clinical activity and safety of single-
agent inotuzumab ozogamicin compared with standard intensive chemotherapy in adults 
with relapsed/refractory B-cell ALL given as the first or second salvage treatment.

 Methods
Study Design and Patients
In this open-label, 2-arm, randomized phase 3 trial (NCT01564784), eligible patients were 
aged ≥18 years with relapsed or refractory (≥5% bone marrow blasts based on local 
morphologic analysis) CD22-positive, Philadelphia chromosome (Ph)–positive or Ph-
negative ALL, who were due to receive their first or second salvage treatment. See 
Supplementary Appendix for additional eligibility criteria. Patients were randomized (1:1) to 
inotuzumab ozogamicin or investigator’s choice of standard therapies; no crossover between 
arms was allowed. Stratification factors at randomization were duration of first remission 
(<12 or ≥12 months), salvage treatment phase (1 or 2), and age (<55 or ≥55 years). 
Responders could undergo stem cell transplant at the investigator’s discretion.
The protocol was approved by the Independent Ethics Committee and/or Institutional 
Review Board at each study center. Informed consent was obtained in accordance with the 
Declaration of Helsinki. The study was designed through a collaboration of the sponsor and 
lead investigators. The sponsor held the data included in this manuscript. Generated data 
tables were freely accessible to all authors, who together with sponsor representatives, were 
responsible for analyses. All authors vouch for data/analysis accuracy and adherence to the 
protocol, which is available at NEJM.org, and contributed to drafting and critically 
reviewing the manuscript, approving the final draft, and the decision to publish it. Editorial 
support for this manuscript was provided by Johna Van Stelten, PhD, and Simon Slater, 
PhD, of Complete Healthcare Communications, LLC, who developed the first draft under 
direction from the authors, and was funded by Pfizer Inc.
Treatments
Patients in the inotuzumab ozogamicin arm received a starting dose of 1.8 mg/m2 
intravenously per cycle (0.8 mg/m2 on day 1; 0.5 mg/m2 on days 8 and 15 of each cycle 
[cycle 1, 21 days; subsequent cycles, 28 days; ≤6 cycles]). Once complete remission (CR) or 
CR with incomplete hematologic recovery (CRi) was achieved, the day 1 dose was reduced 
to 0.5 mg/m2 for the duration of the study. Patients in the standard therapy arm received (per 
investigator’s choice) either FLAG (cytarabine 2.0 g/m2/d on days 1–6; fludarabine 30 
mg/m2/d on days 2–6; granulocyte-colony stimulating factor 5 μg/kg/d [or per institutional 
standard] during a 28-day cycle [≤4 cycles]), cytarabine plus mitoxantrone (cytarabine 200 
mg/m2/d on days 1–7; mitoxantrone [Mitox] 12 mg/m2/d on days 1–3 during a 15- to 20-day 
cycle [≤4 cycles; dose reduction to ≥8 mg/m2 allowed based on age, comorbidities and prior 
anthracycline use]), or high-dose cytarabine (HIDAC; 3 g/m2 every 12 hours [≤12 doses; 1.5 
g/m2 recommended for patients aged ≥55 years]). These 3 regimens are commonly used for 
the treatment of relapsed and refractory ALL and were chosen for the comparator arm to 
provide investigators latitude to tailor the regimen to the patient’s condition, treatment 
history, and standard practice. Dose schedule modifications are detailed in the 
Supplementary Appendix.

 Outcomes
This study has 2 primary endpoints (see Statistical Analysis section): (1) CR/CRi and (2) 
overall survival. Secondary endpoints included safety, remission duration, progression-free 
survival, stem cell transplant rate, and MRD rate among responders.
For all patients, marrow aspirate (or biopsies if clinically indicated) and disease assessments 
were performed at screening; days 16 to 28 of cycles 1, 2, and 3, then every 1 to 2 cycles; at 
the end-of-treatment visit; during planned follow-up visits; and as clinically indicated. CR 
and disease progression status were assessed using modified Cheson criteria31 
(Supplementary Appendix); CRi was defined as for CR except with absolute neutrophil 
count <1000/μL and/or platelets <100,000/μL. MRD-negativity was assessed as <0.01% 
marrow blasts and was analyzed by a central laboratory using multicolor, multiparameter 
flow cytometry. Definitions of duration of remission among patients with CR/CRi, 
progression-free survival, and overall survival are provided in the Supplementary Appendix.
Treatment-emergent adverse events (from all causes) were defined as any event occurring 
between the first dose and ≤42 days after last dose, all treatment-related adverse events 
occurring after last dose, and all veno-occlusive liver disease/sinusoidal obstruction 
syndrome events (any cause) occurring within 2 years after randomization. Veno-occlusive 
disease/sinusoidal obstruction syndrome was assessed and diagnosed by the investigators 
and evaluated according to previously defined clinical criteria (Supplementary Appendix).
Statistical Analysis
The sample size was calculated to adequately assess differences in CR/CRi and overall 
survival independently by splitting the 1-sided alpha of 0.025 evenly between the 2 primary 
endpoints. With 218 patients and 1-sided alpha of 0.0125, the study had ≥88.5% power to 
detect a difference in CR/CRi probabilities of 61% in the inotuzumab ozogamicin arm 
versus 37% in the standard care arm; with 248 overall survival events and 1-sided alpha of 
0.0125, the study had 80% power to detect a difference in overall survival (median of 6.45 
months in the inotuzumab ozogamicin arm and 4.30 months in the standard arm; hazard 
ratio [HR], 0.67). All reported P values are 2-sided.
Results
Patients and Study Treatment
A total of 279 patients (inotuzumab ozogamicin, n=141; standard, n=138) from 18 countries 
were randomized between August 27, 2012 and a data cutoff date of October 2, 2014 (Fig. 
S1), among whom 259 received ≥1 dose of study treatment and were included in the safety 
population (inotuzumab ozogamicin, n=139; standard, n=120). The remaining 20 patients 
were randomized but not treated by the cutoff date. An additional 47 patients were then 
randomized after this cut-off date for a total of 326 patients to obtain further survival data. 
The prespecified requirement for ≥248 events to trigger the final overall survival analysis 
was achieved on March 8, 2016 when 252 events were observed. Therefore, survival data as 
of March 8, 2016 are presented for 326 patients included in the ITT population. Data based 
on an unlocked trial database.

 Among the safety population, a total of 369 treatment cycles were initiated with inotuzumab 
ozogamicin versus 152 with standard therapy (FLAG, n=106; cytarabine + mitoxantrone, 
n=29; HIDAC, n=17). Patients in the inotuzumab ozogamicin arm received a median (range) 
of 3 (1–6) treatment cycles versus 1 (1–4) cycle in the standard arm. Compared with 
inotuzumab ozogamicin, few patients received ≥2 cycles of standard therapy, as was 
expected (73% vs 22%).
Dose reductions were more common over the duration of study treatment with inotuzumab 
ozogamicin versus standard therapies (12% vs 3%), whereas dose interruptions were less 
common (3% vs 15%). Compared with standard therapy, more patients receiving 
inotuzumab ozogamicin discontinued treatment due to achieving a complete response (35% 
vs 15%), whereas fewer patients discontinued inotuzumab ozogamicin because of resistant 
disease (10% vs 40%; Fig. S1). Currently, no patients remain on active study treatment.
Efficacy
The final CR/CRi primary analysis was prespecified to include the first 218 patients 
randomized in the intention-to-treat population (ITT218: inotuzumab ozogamicin, n=109 
and standard, n=109) and was assessed by an independent, blinded, central endpoint 
adjudication committee (CR/CRi in subsequently randomized patients was not adjudicated). 
The demographics and baseline characteristics of the ITT218 population were well-balanced 
across treatment arms (Table 1). In the ITT218 population, the CR/CRi rate was significantly 
higher with inotuzumab ozogamicin versus standard therapy (80.7% [95% CI, 72%–88%] vs 
29.4% [21%–39%]; P<0.001). Thirteen patients randomized to standard therapy in the 
ITT218 population refused to start treatment; CR/CRi rate with the standard care arm would 
have been skewed by their inclusion in the denominator. In an “as-treated” analysis 
excluding these 13 patients (inotuzumab ozogamicin, n=109; standard, n=96), the CR/CRi 
rate was again significantly higher with inotuzumab ozogamicin (80.7% [95% CI, 72%–
88%] vs 33.3% [24%–44%]; P<0.001). In a subgroup analysis of the ITT218 population 
defined by randomization stratification factors and baseline patient characteristics, CR/CRi 
rate per endpoint adjucation committee was significantly higher (P≤0.004) with inotuzumab 
ozogamicin for all factors examined, except baseline Ph+ or t(4;11) karyotype (Fig. 1). In 
both arms, most patients achieving a CR/CRi did so at the end of cycle 1 (inotuzumab 
ozogamicin, n=64/88 [73%]; standard, n=29/32 [91%]). Among patients with CR/CRi, the 
MRD-negativity rate was significantly higher with inotuzumab ozogamicin versus standard 
therapy (78.4% [95% CI, 68%–87%] vs 28.1% [14%–47%]; P<0.001; Table 2).
Among patients in the ITT218 cohort with CR/CRi (per investigator’s assessment: 
inotuzumab ozogamicin, n=85; standard, n=31), with or without follow-up stem cell 
transplant, the median (95% CI) remission duration was 4.6 (3.9–5.4) months with 
inotuzumab ozogamicin versus 3.1 (1.4–4.9) with standard therapy (overall HR [95% CI], 
0.55 [0.31–0.96]; P=0.03; Fig. 2A). Remission duration by MRD status is shown in Fig. S2. 
Significantly more patients proceeded to stem cell transplant directly after treatment with 
inotuzumab ozogamicin versus standard therapy (41% [n=45/109] vs 11% [n=12/109]; 
P<0.001); more patients received myeloablative conditioning (inotuzumab ozogamicin, 71% 
[n=32/45] vs standard therapy, 75% [n=9/12]) versus reduced intensity conditioning (29%

 [n=13/45] vs 17% [n=2/12]). More patients achieving CR/CRi (per investigator’s 
assessment) proceeded directly to stem cell transplant after inotuzumab ozogamicin versus 
standard therapy (48% [n=41/85] vs 32% [n=10/31]; P=0.12); the remission duration for 
these patients was 5.5 (95% CI, 4.9–8.0) months for inotuzumab ozogamicin versus 5.7 
(0.8–not reached) months for standard therapy.
In the ITT survival analysis (inotuzumab ozogamicin, n=164; standard, n=162), progression-
free survival was significantly longer with inotuzumab ozogamicin vs standard care (HR, 
0.45 [97.5% CI, 0.34–0.61]; P<0.001; Fig. 2B), with median progression-free survival 5.0 
[95% CI, 3.7–5.6] vs 1.8 [95% CI, 1.5–2.2] months. The overall survival hazard ratio was 
0.77 (97.5% CI, 0.58–1.03; P=0.04; Fig. 2C) Median overall survival for inotuzumab 
ozogamicin was 7.7 [95% CI, 6.0–9.2] vs 6.7 [4.9–8.3] months for standard care; 2-year 
overall survival rate, 23% [95% CI, 16%–30%] vs 10% [5%–16%]; Fig. 2C). The primary 
objective to demonstrate significantly improved final overall survival with inotuzumab 
ozogamicin vs standard care was not met at prespecified boundary of P=0.0208. However, 
overall survival data appeared to depart from the proportional hazards assumption; therefore, 
an exploratory posthoc restricted mean survival time analysis was applied32 (truncation time, 
37.7 months) to more precisely define the clinical benefit of inotuzumab ozogamicin. This 
analysis demonstrated a longer mean overall survival with inotuzumab ozogamicin vs 
standard care (mean [SE] 13.9 [1.10] vs 9.9 [0.85] months; P=0.005).
Safety
Among the safety population (data cutoff: October 2, 2014), the most common all-cause and 
treatment-related hematologic treatment emergent adverse events in both arms were 
cytopenias (Table S1). The incidence of grade ≥3 thrombocytopenia was lower with 
inotuzumab ozogamicin versus standard therapy (37% vs 59%); fewer patients received 
platelet transfusions with inotuzumab ozogamicin versus standard therapy (64% vs 95%; 
median [range] days of transfusion, 5 [1–51] vs 7 [1–26]). Grade ≥3 febrile neutropenia 
occurred in 24% of patients treated with inotuzumab ozogamicin and 49% of patients treated 
with standard therapy. Common nonhematologic treatment emergent adverse events (all 
grade; grade ≥3) with inotuzumab ozogamicin included nausea (32%; 2%), headache (28%; 
1%), and pyrexia (27%; 4%); most common nonhematologic treatment emergent adverse 
events (all grade; grade ≥3) with standard therapy were nausea (47%; 0%), pyrexia (43%; 
5%), and diarrhea (40%; 1%). Overall, the number of patients experiencing serious adverse 
events was similar with inotuzumab ozogamicin and standard therapy (48% vs 46%) during 
a median of 3 versus 1 treatment cycle, respectively; febrile neutropenia was the most 
frequently reported serious adverse event in both arms (inotuzumab ozogamicin, 12%; 
standard, 18%; Table 3).
Liver toxicities were more common with inotuzumab ozogamicin versus standard therapy 
(Table S1) for the total duration of treatment cycles initiated (inotuzumab ozogamicin, 369 
cycles; standard care, 152 cycles); the most frequent any grade liver-related treatment 
emergent adverse events were increased aspartate aminotransferase (inotuzumab 
ozogamicin, 20%; standard, 10%), hyperbilirubinemia (15%; 10%), and increased alanine 
aminotransferase (14%; 11%). All cases of veno-occlusive disease were reported for up to 2

 years from randomization. Veno-occlusive disease occurred more frequently with 
inotuzumab ozogamicin compared with standard therapy (11% [n=15] vs 1% [n=1]). In the 
inotuzumab ozogamicin arm, 5 patients developed veno-occlusive disease during or shortly 
after study treatment (2 of these 5 patients received prestudy stem cell transplant). Of 48 
patients in the inotuzumab ozogamicin arm who proceeded to transplant, 10 developed veno-
occlusive disease after transplant (3 with prestudy transplant), 7 of whom had received 
defibrotide (2 cases resolved, 4 ongoing, and 1 fatal). Of 20 patients in the standard therapy 
arm who proceeded to transplant, 1 developed veno-occlusive disease after transplant; no 
cases of veno-occlusive disease occurred during standard therapy. The median (range) time 
to develop veno-occlusive disease after transplant in the inotuzumab ozogamicin arm was 16 
(3–39) days. In a multivariate analysis of baseline factors associated with post-transplant 
veno-occlusive disease, alkylator conditioning regimen (dual [n=8] vs single [n=33]) was the 
only significant covariate (P=0.04; Table S2).
A total of 17 and 11 grade 5 treatment emergent adverse events occurred with inotuzumab 
ozogamicin and standard therapy, respectively, including 4 and 2 fatal adverse events 
deemed to be treatment-related. Two treatment-related deaths due to veno-occlusive disease 
occurred with inotuzumab ozogamicin (both after poststudy transplant).
Discussion
In this phase 3 trial, inotuzumab ozogamicin demonstrated a significantly higher remission 
rate compared with standard intensive chemotherapy in adults with relapsed/refractory B-
cell ALL; more responders achieved MRD-negativity (2.8-fold increase; P<0.001); and more 
patients proceeded to stem cell transplant (P<0.001). Compared with standard care, 
inotuzumab ozogamicin also provided significantly prolonged progression-free survival and 
evidence for improved long-term survival. Of note, remission rates were significantly 
improved with inotuzumab ozogamicin versus standard care in patients with both higher 
(≥90%) and lower (<90%) CD22 expression levels. The only patients for whom remission 
rates were not significantly different between arms were those with Ph+ or t(4;11) ALL. 
Overall, the safety profile of inotuzumab ozogamicin is consistent with that reported 
previously;30 veno-occlusive disease was a major non-hematologic toxicity. The remission 
rate observed in this study is higher than reported previously for single-agent inotuzumab 
ozogamicin (58%),30 possibly due to patients being treated later in the disease course in the 
prior study. The remission rate is also significantly higher than reported previously for 
conventional chemotherapy. Newer targeted therapies have also demonstrated higher 
remission rates than reported with conventional chemotherapy.33 For example, 69% of 
patients with ALL selected for early and refractory relapses achieved CR/CRi (median 
remission duration, 9 months) while receiving blinatumomab (a bispecific anti-CD19/CD3 
monoclonal antibody).34,35 Remission rates associated with blinatumomab were relatively 
higher among patients with lower disease burden.34 In contrast, observed CR/CRi rates 
associated with inotuzumab ozogamicin were similar for patients with high versus low 
disease burden as assessed by baseline marrow blasts (Fig. 1B). Chimeric antigen receptor–
modified T-cells targeting CD19 are also associated with high CR (~60%–90%) and MRD 
negativity rates (70%–100% of responders) among pediatric and young adult patients with 
relapsed/refractory ALL.36–38

 The observation that progression-free survival was significantly longer and the 2-year 
overall survival rate was higher with inotuzumab ozogamicin versus standard care is 
consistent with the observed significantly higher response rate. Although the results also 
provide evidence for longer overall survival, the second primary objective of demonstrating 
a significant improvement in final overall survival with inotuzumab ozogamicin vs standard 
care was not met at the prespecified 2-sided P-value boundary of 0.0208. However, it was 
noted that overall survival data appeared to depart from the proportional hazards assumption, 
as reflected by an apparent heterogeneity in the curve for standard care (see Fig. 2C). Given 
this, an exploratory posthoc restricted mean survival time analysis was performed,32 which 
demonstrated prolonged mean overall survival with inotuzumab ozogamicin versus standard 
care (P=0.005). Based on the apparent separation of the overall survival curves after ~14 
months, it may be speculated that the survival benefit occurs at later time points. Separate 
subgroup analyses of overall survival by patient and disease characteristics (eg, age, salvage 
status, transplant status, cytogenetics) are planned to delineate reasons underlying this 
apparent heterogeneity in the overall survival data.
Hematologic cytopenias were the most common toxicities associated with inotuzumab 
treatment. Fewer patients in the inotuzumab ozogamicin arm received platelet transfusions; 
those who did, received fewer days of transfusion. Febrile neutropenia was less common 
with inotuzumab ozogamicin; however, hepatic toxicities, including hyperbilirubinemia and 
veno-occlusive disease, were much more common. The conditioning regimen may make a 
contribution to the risk of veno-occlusive disease given that dual versus single alkylator 
conditioning was a significant covariate. Consistent with this, a previous study reported a 
higher incidence of veno-occlusive disease in inotuzumab ozogamicin-treated patients 
undergoing stem cell transplant after receiving a dual alkylator conditioning regimen 
(n=5/13) compared with a single alkylator regimen (n=1/21).30 In a previous study of 
patients with relapsed/refractory non-Hodgkin lymphoma, only 1 of 79 receiving single-
agent inotuzumab ozogamicin developed veno-occlusive disease.39 The study excluded 
patients with prior allogeneic stem cell transplant, suggesting that inotuzumab ozogamicin 
therapy outside the context of stem cell transplant carries a low risk of veno-occlusive 
disease.
A significantly greater proportion of patients in the ITT218 population were able to proceed 
to transplant after inotuzumab ozogamicin compared with standard treatment (41% vs 11%; 
P<0.001). Given that stem cell transplant is considered the only curative treatment option, 
the ability of inotuzumab ozogamicin treatment to increase the number of patients able to 
bridge to transplant after salvage therapy is encouraging.

 Figure 2. Duration of Remission Among Patients with CR/CRi (A), Progression-Free Survival 
(B), and Overall Survival (C)
Medians were estimated using the Kaplan-Meier method, P values are from stratified log-
rank test, and hazard ratio (HR) and corresponding CI were estimated using stratified Cox 
proportional hazard regression. OS and PFS data represent all 326 patients included in the 
ITT population (InO, n=164; SC, n=162), and duration of remission is based on the patients 
with best response of CR/CRi (investigator assessed). Note: because no disease assessments 
were evaluated by the endpoint adjudication committee after the end of treatment, analysis 
of DoR was based on the investigator’s assessments. CR=complete remission; 
CRi=complete remission with incomplete hematologic recovery; InO= inotuzumab 
ozogamicin; DoR=duration of remission; PFS=progression-free survival; OS=overall 
survival; SC=standard of care. Data represent the ITT218 population (InO, n=109; SC, 
n=109).
