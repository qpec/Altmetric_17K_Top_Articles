Birthplace choices: what are the
information needs of women when
choosing where to give birth in England? A
qualitative study using online and face to
face focus groups
Lisa Hinton1*, Carol Dumelow1, Rachel Rowe2 and Jennifer Hollowell2
Abstract
Background: Current clinical guidelines and national policy in England support offering ‘low risk’ women a choice
of birth setting. Options include: home, free-standing midwifery unit (FMU), alongside midwifery unit (AMU) or
obstetric unit (OU). This study, which is part of a broader project designed to inform policy on ‘choice’ in relation to
childbirth, aimed to provide evidence on UK women’s experiences of choice and decision-making in the period
since the publication of the Birthplace findings (2011) and new NICE guidelines (2014). This paper reports on
findings relating to women’s information needs when making decisions about where to give birth.
Methods: A qualitative focus group study including 69 women in the last trimester of pregnancy in England in
2015–16. Seven focus groups were conducted online via a bespoke web portal, and one was face-to-face. To
explore different aspects of women’s experience, each group included women with specific characteristics or
options; planning a home birth, living in areas with lots of choice, living in areas with limited choice, first time
mothers, living close to a FMU, living in opt-out AMU areas, living in socioeconomically disadvantaged areas and
planning to give birth in an OU. Focus group transcripts were analysed thematically.
Results: Women drew on multiple sources when making choices about where to give birth. Sources included; the
Internet, friends’ recommendations and experiences, antenatal classes and their own personal experiences. Their
midwife was not the main source of information. Women wanted the option to discuss and consider their birth
preferences throughout their pregnancy, not at a fixed point.
Conclusions: Birthplace choice is informed by many factors. Women may encounter fewer overt obstacles to
exercising choice than in the past, but women do not consistently receive information about birthplace options
from their midwife at a time and in a manner that they find helpful. Introducing options early in pregnancy, but
deferring decision-making about birthplace until a woman has had time to consider and explore options and
discuss these with her midwife, might facilitate choice.

 Background
It is current national policy in England that every woman
should be able to choose the most appropriate place and
health professional for her care “based on her wishes and
cultural preferences and any medical and obstetric needs
she and her baby may have” [1]. The 2014 NICE guideline
on intrapartum care for healthy women and babies [2]
recommends that women be advised that they may choose
any birth setting including at home, in a freestanding mid-
wifery unit (FMU), alongside midwifery unit (AMU) or an
obstetric unit (OU).
This recommendation was based in large part on the
findings of the Birthplace in England cohort study which
was published in 2011 [3]. This study demonstrated that,
for healthy women with straightforward pregnancies,
planned birth in a midwifery unit was safe for the baby,
and that planned home births were safe for women
having a second or subsequent baby, but with some
increased risk to the baby for women having a first baby.
Planning birth at home or in a midwifery unit was also
associated with a reduced chance of the woman having
an intervention during labour or birth, including aug-
mentation, epidural/spinal analgesia and an instrumental
or caesarean birth.
The 2014 NICE guideline states that “It is important
that the woman is given information and advice about
all available settings when she is deciding where to have
her baby, so that she is able to make a fully informed
decision” and gives recommendations about the informa-
tion which should be provided to women. The guideline
includes a table of intervention and transfer rates and
perinatal outcomes for each birth setting, which it is sug-
gested should be discussed with women planning place of
birth. However, the guideline acknowledges that there is
little
evidence
on
how
this
information
should be
presented to women and how the provision of information
affects women’s decision-making about place of birth.
In England, the largest of the four countries of the
UK, the provision of midwifery units, particularly
AMUs within hospitals, has increased substantially [4]
since these two publications. In 2013, 79% of women
in England lived within 30 min’ drive of both an OU
and a midwifery unit (AMU or FMU) [5]. More re-
cently a national survey of women’s experiences of
maternity care found that 41% of women were offered
a choice of giving birth in a midwifery unit and 39%
were offered the option of a home birth [6]. However,
despite this apparent range of options, recent data
show that the vast majority of women (87% in 2013)
still give birth in an OU; the home birth rate is static
at around 2.3% of births; [7] and although the num-
ber of FMUs has increased slightly in recent years,
the proportion of women giving birth in FMUs in
England remains static at around 2% [8].
While some women who plan birth in consultant-led
OUs (see Table 1) may do so because of lack of choice in
their area, [9] there is also evidence to suggest that most
women currently consider that a ‘hospital’ with onsite
medical facilities is the ‘normal’ and ‘safest’ place to give
birth [10]. However, research has also shown that such
views are not fixed and that the provision of information
about alternative options may change women’s views
and preferences [11]. The extent to which most women
are aware of differences between types of setting for
birth, or are given information about their possible op-
tions, is unclear [5].
Against this backdrop, the Birthplace Choices project,
[12] was designed to inform policy on ‘choice’ in relation to
childbirth. A systematic literature review conducted in early
2015 as part of the project [13] did not identify any evi-
dence relating to UK women’s experiences of choice and
decision-making in the period after publication of the
Birthplace findings in 2011. The Birthplace study provided
robust evidence about the safety of different birth settings
in England [14]. The study prompted substantial changes
to online NHS patient information for pregnant women
[15] and also changes to the recommended advice to be
given to women about choosing where to give birth, with
midwifery units and home births (for multiparous women)
becoming the recommended setting for ‘low risk’ women
[2]. To provide evidence about women’s experiences in the
wake of these changes, and also to inform the design of a
discrete choice experiment (DCE) which forms part of the
Birthplace
Choices
project,
we
undertook
qualitative
research, using online focus groups (which included both
online ‘chat’ and message boards) and one face-to-face
focus group with women across England. This component
of the Birthplace Choices project aimed to explore: (a) the
factors that are important to women when making a choice
between different settings for birth; (b) the attributes of
maternity services which women particularly value; (c) the
services that an NHS trust needs to provide in order to
offer women a realistic choice of home birth; (d) the effect
of travel time and distance on women’s choices; and (e)
how women access and evaluate information about birth
place options. In this paper we report on findings relating
to women’s information needs and preferences, including
their knowledge of the birth place options available to
them, how they gathered information about their options
from different sources and their views on the information
they would like to receive from midwives. Findings relating
to other objectives will be reported in a separate paper
relating to the development and piloting of the Birthplace
Choices DCE.
Methods
This study was a qualitative focus group study, with
eight groups conducted either online or face to face,
Hinton et al. BMC Pregnancy and Childbirth  (2018) 18:12

 with women in the last trimester of pregnancy in
England.
Ethics approval
The study methods and documentation were reviewed
and approved by University of Oxford Central University
Research
Ethics
Committee
(CUREC).
The
study
received CUREC approval to offer a shopping voucher
(for £25) to participants to thank them for their time
taking part in the study.
Stakeholder consultation
During the design phase of the project two consultation
meetings were held with User Group representatives and
other stakeholders (see acknowledgements) to ‘brain-
storm’ issues that the project might address and to
develop and test a conceptual model of access to choice
(which has been used and reported elsewhere [4, 13])
This input informed decisions about the composition of
the focus groups and the topics included in the discus-
sion guide (Additional file 1).
Recruitment and sampling
To explore different aspects of women’s experience, each
group included women with specific characteristics or
options as identified by our knowledge of the literature
and feedback during our stakeholder consultation. The
groups were women:
� planning a homebirth (group 1),
� living in areas with lots of choice (group 2),
� living in areas with limited choice (group 3),
� who were first time mothers (group 4),
� living close to an FMU (group 5),
� living in opt-out AMU areas (group 6),
� living in socioeconomically disadvantaged areas (face
to face) (group 7),
� planning to give birth in an OU (group 8).
Each focus group included up to 12 women who were
in their third trimester of pregnancy. Women were
included if they were expecting to have a spontaneous
vaginal birth, had a low risk pregnancy with no complica-
tions, were 18 years and over and lived in England. Our
criteria therefore excluded women who were expecting to
have a Caesarean birth and other groups of women who
would normally be advised to give birth in an OU, such as
those with medical risk factors or current pregnancy com-
plications. Details of participants are shown in Table 2
(with additional details in Additional file 2).
The web portal online chat was accessible to women
who had a laptop or desktop computer. We also gave
women the option of using an iPad and taking part in
the discussion boards only. To be able to include as
socio-economically diverse a sample as possible, we
offered to reimburse women if they needed to use an
internet café or library so that they could still take part
if they did not have the technology at home. No one
took up this offer.
Pregnant women were recruited from non-NHS settings
such as antenatal classes, pregnancy yoga groups, libraries,
children’s centres, national childbirth organisations, online
pregnancy and parenting forums, personal contacts, and
word of mouth. “Gatekeepers” (for example the organisers
of a yoga group) were identified through online resources
and were contacted by the researcher asking for help in
publicising the study to recruit pregnant women for the
focus groups, using word of mouth, handing out flyers and
displaying posters. Women interested in finding out more
were asked to contact the researcher (CD) directly. We also
had a Birthplace Choices webpage providing details of the
project for potential participants. If women were interested
in taking part they were sent the participant information
sheet and a consent form via the post or email and asked to
complete the consent form before the focus group started.
Women were given a shopping voucher after the focus
groups to thank them for taking part in the study.
Table 1 Terms used to describe birth settings (adapted from Rowe et al., [51])
Obstetric unit (OU) (also called a
‘labour ward’ or ‘delivery suite’)
NHS maternity unit in which care is provided by a team, with obstetricians taking primary professional
responsibility for women at higher risk of complications during labour and birth. Midwives care for all
women in an OU and take primary responsibility for ‘low risk’ women. Diagnostic and treatment
medical services including obstetric, neonatal and anaesthetic care are available on site, 24 h a day.
Alongside midwifery unit (AMU)
NHS maternity unit for ‘low risk’ women in which midwives take primary professional responsibility for
care. Diagnostic and treatment medical services, including obstetric, neonatal and anaesthetic care are
available, should they be needed, in the same building, or in a separate building on the same site.
Transfer will normally be by trolley, bed or wheelchair.
Admission to an AMU may be based on an ‘opt-in’ policy whereby ‘low risk’ women choose to plan birth in the
AMU, or ‘opt-out’ whereby the AMU is the default option for ‘low risk’ women.
Freestanding midwifery unit
(FMU)
NHS maternity unit for ‘low risk’ women in which midwives take primary professional responsibility for care.
General Practitioners may also be involved in care. Diagnostic and treatment medical services, including obstetric,
neonatal and anaesthetic care, are not immediately available but are located on a separate site should they be
needed. Transfer will normally be by car or ambulance.
Home birth
Planned birth in the woman’s own home, where care is provided by an NHS or independent midwife. If diagnostic
and treatment medical services are required, transfer will normally be by car or ambulance.

 To ensure that we did not exclude women who did
not have access to online technology, we held a face to
face group with 10 women in Tower Hamlets, London,
recruited through a local women’s group who support
disadvantaged and vulnerable pregnant women.
Focus groups
The eight focus groups were held across England be-
tween July 2015 and March 2016 with a total of 69
pregnant women in their third trimester. To maximise
the geographical spread of women we could recruit, we
used an online approach for seven of the eight groups.
Focus groups were conducted online, using a specially
designed (closed) web portal called “Birthplace Choices”.
The web portal was designed and supported by the
DIPEx Charity, which is closely linked with the Health
Experiences Research Group as it publishes the Health-
talk website [16]. The staff has the expertise to provide

 the online support that we needed to create and host the
web portal. Each focus group participant had access to
the web portal through an individually assigned pass-
word. Only members of the research team and women
participating in the specific focus group had access to
the focus group discussions and the women were given
anonymous identities (see Table 2). The online focus
groups each lasted a week to give women the opportun-
ity to participate flexibly. Each online group started with
a live text-based web chat lasting 60 min where women
were able to introduce themselves, get to know each
other and initial questions were posed by the moderator.
The online focus group finished at the end of the week
with another live web chat, this time only 30 min. In
between these two live chats, the women were invited to
participate in discussion boards on which one of the
researchers posted further questions. The online groups
were moderated and facilitated by LH. The discussion
boards were facilitated by CD. The extended time frame
was intended to give the opportunity for participants to
overcome the inevitable anonymity of an online platform.
Having an initial live chat followed by several days to
reflect on the questions posed meant that the women
were able to get to know each other, and the researchers,
build rapport and consider and reflect on the questions
posed. The live chats and message boards elicited different
responses; while the live chats were both quite busy, fast
paced conversations, the message boards were an oppor-
tunity for women to reflect on their answers more slowly.
The final live chat was a way for all participants to pick up
on threads of conversation and for the researchers to pose
final follow up questions that had emerged.
The face to face group was moderated by LH and was
audio recorded. This group included women who did
not speak English as their first language. An interpreter
was present to assist when required.
Interview guides were designed for the first online web
chat and initial discussion board questions, and for the
face to face group, based on our knowledge of the litera-
ture and our discussions with stakeholders. The inter-
view guides were amended slightly according to the
focus of each group and developed iteratively as the
study progressed. Questions for the second online chat
for each group were informed by the issues raised by the
women on the discussion board during the week.
Analysis
Transcripts were created automatically from the data
generated by the online groups. Transcripts from the
face to face group were transcribed and translated
(where required, most of the discussion was in English).
All the data were entered into NVivo qualitative data
analysis package [17]. A coding frame was developed by
CD and LH (Additional file 3). They read a sub-sample
of transcripts and conferred about the framework before
each transcript was coded. A thematic analysis was
conducted with key categories and themes identified
using the ‘One Sheet of Paper’ (OSOP) method [18].
Pseudonyms were used during the online focus groups.
Participants in the face to face group have been assigned
pseudonyms (see Table 2).
Results
The results presented here report on women’s know-
ledge of the birth place options available to them, how
they gather information about their options and which
sources they draw on. We also report on the information
that women would like from their midwives.
Knowledge of options available
Few women we spoke to had been aware early on in
their pregnancy of the options they could choose from
in their local area. Some knew about the options from
previous pregnancies, or they had researched it them-
selves, or knew they wanted a home birth so had not
researched the other options. For others, knowledge of
their options increased as their pregnancy progressed.
This knowledge was gained from a wide range of
sources. Midwives were not the main source of informa-
tion for women (see below).
Charlotte didn’t know she had more than one choice
until she attended her local NCT classes. Belinda found
out from another mum that she could choose a different
hospital than the one closest to her. Bobbi learned
through Facebook that she could choose another hospital.
“I literally found out today from some random Facebook
comments that I *didn't* have to choose my local
hospital. I still would, because of distance, but it might
have been useful to know.” (Bobbi, Focus group 8,
planning birth in an OU).
Reflecting on her knowledge of what choice she had in
her first and second pregnancy, Katrina said, “I wasn’t
aware there was a choice with the first pregnancy. Second
pregnancy feel more informed but perhaps that is because
I know what to ask.” (Katrina, Focus group 5, living close
to an FMU).
Brenda, a first-time mum, talked about finding out
about her birth options, “I'm not sure if I'm supposed to
be looking or they're supposed to tell me about my
options but I normally research everything myself. I
haven't had this conversation with the midwife as well.”
(Brenda, Focus group 8, planning birth in an OU).
Other women were not aware there was a choice or
aware of all the options available to them. Some women
did not know there was a choice at all. Some were not
Hinton et al. BMC Pregnancy and Childbirth  (2018) 18:12 
Page 6 of 15
 aware that they could choose other hospitals than the
ones nearby them.
“I wish I’d realised I had a choice to be able to
research a bit, to feel more relaxed about our
decision.” (Katrina, Focus group 5, living close to an
FMU).
Some were not aware that home birth was an option.
A few did not know there was a difference between the
AMU and an OU.
Finding out later in pregnancy about available options
did lead to some women changing their decision to an-
other option; often a less medical setting than the one
they had originally chosen. But more information could
also be used to reassure women that the choice they had
made was the right one for them. When asked if she felt
supported in her choice, Clara, (Focus group 6, opt-out
AMU areas) said “not really, it was much my own
decision and the research I’ve made myself”. By the end of
their pregnancy many knew of all the options available
to them and several said the area they lived in offered all
the options they would like (close to FMU, planning
homebirth, lots of choice, limited choice groups).
How do women gather information about their options
of where to give birth?
When deciding where to give birth, many women we
spoke to had researched their birth options. Even if they
knew what option they wanted, several still looked for
‘confirming’ information that helped them to feel more
confident about their choice and sometimes to justify
their decision to others.
Some women were offered tours of units in hospitals,
and found these visits helpful and reassuring.
“I've been on a hospital visit which made me feel a lot
better about my choice.” (Caroline, Focus Group 6,
optout AMU areas).
However, there were several women who said that
their hospital either did not offer tours, or were too busy
to allow women to look around.
“We were told that unless you felt particularly anxious
about the birth most hospitals (one exception) did not
offer the opportunity to visit. I appreciate the challenge
for the hospital in doing this but would have liked to
have the opportunity to visit to help make an informed
decision.” (Cath, Focus Group 6, opt-out AMU areas).
Two different groups of women, those living in areas
where there was less choice (e.g. near opt-out AMUs or
where FMUs were not available) and those who were
second or third-time mothers, did less research when
making their birth place decisions. Some of these
women said they did not do any research online about
their birth options but they talked to family and friends.
“I don’t think I did much research first time nor
second nor this time lol! I just kinda feel like this is my
third I'll just go with the flow! I know that the only
options around here are hospital or home!”
(Bev, Focus group 8, planning birth in an OU)
Information sources
Women drew on multiple information sources when
making their decision about where to give birth. The
Internet, friends’ recommendations and experiences,
antenatal and birth preparation classes and their per-
sonal experiences of birth were the main sources used.
Some women we spoke to had also gained information
from their midwife. But this was mostly not the main
source of their information.
“My midwife at [OU] gave me leaflets and information
about the options and their website is good. I also
researched online (there's a good tool that ‘Which?’
have for making your decision) and talked to friends.
All of my friends have given birth either in labour
wards or in midwife-led centres and that feels right for
me.” (Julie, first time mother, Focus group 2, lots of
choice).
i) The Internet was used regularly by women to find
more information about a range of factors when making
their decision about where to give birth. Some used the
Internet to look for the facilities available at their local
maternity units. Some researched statistics on assisted
births, caesarean rates, transfer rates and for evidence on
the safety of different options by using the Internet.
Websites such as NHS Choices, Which? Birth Choice,
NICE guidelines, Association for Improvements in the
Maternity Services (AIMS), Positive Birth Movement, the
National Childbirth Trust (NCT) website were popular.
“I must say that my husband and I found the matter of
choosing where to give birth at the very beginning very
daunting (this is our first child) and it was not clear
that it was a decision that could change later in the
pregnancy till about a month ago. For that we talked
briefly to friends but mostly based our decision to go to
the [hospital A] from various online sites about
differences of nearby options and varying stats about the
birthing units like interventions. About a month ago
when it became clear we could change location if we
liked we spoke to family and friends and also used the
NHS reviews page to gauge opinion between the
Hinton et al. BMC Pregnancy and Childbirth  (2018) 18:12 
Page 7 of 15
 [hospital B] and the [hospital A] hospitals. We have
decided to go with the [hospital A]. I know people who
birthed at the [hospital A] and they had mixed reviews.
I know no one who has birthed at the [hospital B].”
(Maggie, Focus group 4, first time mothers).
Some of the women in the opt-out AMU group and
the OU group said they had not looked for any further
statistics and when prompted some were not aware that
statistics on interventions existed.
“No, didn't know that information existed.” (Cath,
Focus group 6, Opt-out AMU).
“no i havent looked at the intervention rates, is it
available for us to view?” (Carrie, Focus group 6, Opt-out
AMU).
The Internet was also used to find out about other
women’s experiences of birth. Netmums and Babycen-
tre.co.uk were a popular source for this type of informa-
tion. Rachel had read about birth stories online or
watched YouTube videos about birth. Some women
choosing a home birth had joined social media groups
such as the Positive Birth Movement.
ii) Friends were a very important source of informa-
tion and their experiences of birth were very influential
on the decisions that women made. They were consid-
ered to be a more reliable source of information by some
women who said they would be wary of looking at
Internet forums for people’s experiences because they
may have an agenda. Alexa was planning a home birth.
She was a first time mother, herself a midwife and had
been exposed to lots of women’s birth experiences.
“Because birth is such an emotive experience, hearing
people's experiences directly has had more of a
meaningful impact than what I have read and the way
they tell the story, as well as what they say, has been
influential. When women I've looked after or friends
speak passionately and positively about their birth
experiences, wherever they had their baby, I always feel
inspired!” (Alexa, Focus group 1, Home birth).
Conversely Janice said she had avoided talking to
friends in too much detail about their birth experi-
ences because many had had ‘tricky births’. Friends
provided information on their experiences of different
types of birth and their experiences at local maternity
units. Several women we spoke to said that their
friends’ experiences (either positive or negative) at a
local maternity unit had influenced their decision
about which maternity unit to choose.
“Good reputation and feedback from friends……People we
know and their experience”. (Clara, Focus group 6, opt-
out AMU areas).
“Real life experience, and reliable information” (Mina,
Focus group 4, first time mothers).
“More discussion with my midwife halfway through
the pregnancy would have been helpful, as I
mentioned my midwife is very much about the box
ticking and rushing through the appointments without
much time for my inconvenient questions! What I have
learnt has been through friends or NCT.” (Mandy,
Focus group 4, first time mothers).
But Cath explained that her friends had positive expe-
riences at all the local maternity units so friends’ experi-
ences weren’t all that helpful in her decision-making.
Sometimes friends’ stories of birth in hospital had
influenced women to consider other options and had
put them off having a hospital birth. Julie had friends
who had recently had midwife-led or OU births and she
said this seemed the right thing for her too. Jackie, Julie
and Kerry had doctor friends who were very discour-
aging of anything other than a hospital birth and for
Kerry and Julie, these views had been an important
factor in their decision-making.
“I haven't felt discouraged by anyone. Family and
health professionals have nudged me towards a
hospital birth, but I'm with them.” (Bree, Focus group
8, planning birth in an OU).
iii) Classes. Antenatal/birth preparation classes and
pregnancy exercise
classes were also an important
source of information for some women about the range
of birth place options available to them, although they
are generally attended later in pregnancy. Mina and
Rosie found out that home birth was an option in their
areas and Joanna and Badger learnt about the differences
between the AMU and the OU. Roberta learnt through
her NCT classes that she could change her mind about
her choice of birth place right up until she went into
labour.
“We have been going to NCT classes and that is
where I found out that there's a difference between
the birth unit and labour ward. I also found out
there that it makes a difference in pain relief, for
instance you can't have an epidural in the unit but
would be transferred to the ward.” (Mabel, Focus
Group 4, first time mothers)
Hinton et al. BMC Pregnancy and Childbirth  (2018) 18:12 
Page 8 of 15
 “i learnt more about that at nct - my midwife jus
handed me a bunch of leaflets and sent me on my way
to read up.” (Mandy, Focus group 4, first time
mothers).
iv) Another important source of information for
women we spoke to was their personal experience of
birth, whether this was their own experience of giv-
ing birth or their mother’s or family members’ expe-
riences. Women’s own previous birth experiences
(whether negative or positive) shaped their decisions
for their choice of birth place this time. Some of the
women we spoke to had been brought up in a family
environment where home birth was the norm and so
they had not considered any other option when de-
ciding where to give birth themselves. These women
used local home birth support group or positive
birth movement groups to learn more about having
a home birth in their local area.
v) Midwives Women were asked about the information
provided by their midwives. Surprisingly, given national
guidance, their midwife was not a main source of informa-
tion for women about birth choice options. Some women
said that their midwife appointments felt rushed and there
was not time to ask questions, with the focus on assessing
physical wellbeing and little chance to talk about how they
were feeling or their choices around birth. Some said that
their midwives had asked them at the booking appointment
where they wanted to give birth without giving them
enough explanation of the options available to them. Mabel
(Focus Group 4, first time mothers) explained, “The staff
are very nice, but they tick boxes and you’re out the door.”
“I don't think midwives are aware that the whole
birthing process is a mystery to new mums, since they
do it so often and probably can't imagine what it is
like when you've never “been there”.” (Beatrice, Focus
group 8, planning birth in an OU).
“I don’t feel like I was given much information about
all my options – just rolled out the options like a list.”
(Jude, Focus group 2, lots of choice).
A few women felt they had made uninformed deci-
sions as a result of inadequate information from their
midwife. Mina (Focus group 4, first time mothers) said
she had realised that she would prefer somewhere more
relaxed and non-medical, but did not feel there was any-
where close, “to be honest if I was starting this again
with what I know now, I would probably explore the
midwife led unit more”.
“I was asked at my very first midwife appointment at 8
weeks. I had the choice of 4 hospitals […] and was asked
to pick one. Having no real knowledge of the others I
picked the one I knew. I'm sure I could switch now but I've
got my head round where I'll be going, had a look round,
explored parking options etc! I feel I know where I am
with the [hospital] and that it’s a bit late to be changing
now.” (Mina, Focus group 4, first time mothers).
“I don’t feel there is enough information either and I
didn’t realise until later on in my first pregnancy I
could choose other hospitals as my closest one does not
have a midwife led unit. Information about other
hospitals seems hard to find out. It would be great to
be given more information earlier on and told when
tours are on too in hospitals.” (Abigail, Focus group 1,
planning a home birth).
Other women had felt that they did have time to discuss
their options throughout their pregnancy. But, in some
cases, women said they only found out information
because they asked questions. A second-time mother
(Joyce) said she had to ask about a home birth, it had not
been presented as an option.
“If I hadn't mentioned home birth I don’t think anyone
would have presented it to me as an option, we always
get asked which hospital we want to go to” (Joyce,
Focus group 2, lots of choice).
Unlike some of the other women we spoke to, Bree
had been told by her midwife she could choose another
local hospital to give birth if she wanted to.
“I'm planning [Hospital A] but told by my mw that we
could go to [Hospital B] if we want - apparently its lovely”
(Bree, Focus Group 8, planning birth in an OU).
A few women knew which birth option they wanted
and so they did not feel the need to have any further in-
formation from their midwife. Some said they thought
this was why their midwife did not talk about any other
options with them. Often this was the case for women
who had given birth before.
Information women would like from midwives
Many women said they would like their midwives to
provide information about all the options available to
them including further details about each option. Im-
portantly, women wanted something they could take
away with them, mull over and talk to others about and
then have a discussion with their midwife at a later time
in their pregnancy about their decision.
Information was needed early on in pregnancy about all
the available options, with more detail about the individual
options. Many wanted time to learn about all their options
Hinton et al. BMC Pregnancy and Childbirth  (2018) 18:12 
Page 9 of 15
 before making a decision. Some suggested a leaflet or book-
let to be given at their first meeting so that they could think
about their options, possibly discuss with partner, and then
discuss at a later appointment with the midwife. Rona sug-
gested the leaflet could have links to where women could
do their own research.
“I agree, a leaflet was a good source of information to
me first time round. However, I found out through my
hypnobirthing classes about being able to research
statistics etc on transfer rates, assisted births and
caesareans etc. So perhaps with the leaflet a couple of
websites or pointers as to where people can go to do
some research about their options would also be
useful. I think right at the start, at the booking
appointment or even in the Drs Surgery, would be the
best time. You can always keep it in your notes for
when you are ready to think about where you want to
give birth.” (Rona, Focus group 3, limited choice).
“I was asked at my booking appt - when things were still
so new and unknown - where I wanted to give birth
before I had even thought that I had a choice so I went
away after that and researched things on my own and
then confirmed that I wanted to be in the midwife-led
centre, ideally. So the midwife didn't really have an
influence. I think it would have been better if she had said
- “there are a number of options at [hospital], here’s a
leaflet, you don’t have to say what you want now -
let’s talk about it next time”” (Julie, first time
mother, Focus group 2, lots of choice).
“It would be nice to have a brief group session led by
the community midwives that gives guidance on what
is available at each unit in the area. I picked a
hospital that was a specialist maternity hospital
thinking that would probably be the best. What I
really want is a water birth and it wasn't until I was
35 weeks I discovered that there are only two pools at
this hospital, while there are ten pools available at the
hospital which would have been my second choice.”
(Barbara, Focus group 8, planning birth in an OU).
Some would like detailed information to be pro-
vided including statistics for each option on facilities
and medical expertise available, rates of intervention,
unplanned caesareans and the pros and cons of each
option. Others would be happy with a written outline
of the options available and a list of websites where
they could find out further information for them-
selves. Forums and group meetings were suggested as
another way of disseminating this information, as
women we spoke to recognised the limited time that
midwives had to spend with them.
“I think we have to take responsibility for our own
education sometimes. I did NCT and it was great but
there are ante-natal classes out there for free. I don't
necessarily think midwives should have to allocate their
limited time to giving 1-2-1 sessions on options and
possible eventualities when it can be delivered to a
larger group of those who take the initiative to find out.”
(Bridget, Focus group 8, planning birth in an OU).
Views on the best time for midwives to provide this
information varied.
“It's a difficult one as too much information can be an
overload and not enough can make people feel uncertain.
Parents should maybe be asked at what stage they want
the information and how much information they want.”
(Bev, Focus group 8, planning birth in an OU).
Some women suggested a detailed discussion would be
best at about 20 weeks. Amelia (Focus group 1, planning
a home birth) said this “would be early enough to do
proper research and consideration but far enough in that
you are starting to think about birth.” A few women
considered 36 weeks to be a better time for them to have
this discussion.
Despite variation on when is the best time to give
information, one point was clearly made, that women
should have the option to discuss preferences through-
out their pregnancy. Some felt it was important for the
midwife to give women the opportunity to ask questions
and discuss options at subsequent appointments – not
just handed a leaflet, because getting a lot of information
can be overwhelming when first pregnant.
“I think setting out the choices at the beginning and
then an ongoing discussing throughout the pregnancy
to talk about any questions or changes of mind would
be best. I don't think any choices around birth should
be set in stone at any point really. The whole process
is fluid and evolves so really everyone being open to
discussing different options throughout would be
ideal.” (Bobbi, first time mother, Focus group 8,
planning birth in an OU).
Evaluating information
Women were forthcoming about the wide range of
information sources they drew on, but they did not
expand in very great detail about how they evaluated
those different sources. Some women said they were
wary of relying on online chat or internet sites like
Mumsnet, “as people often go online with an agenda.”
(Maria, Focus group 4, first time mothers), others sought
out the advice of friends and “reliable information”
(Mina, Focus group 4, first time mothers). But how they
Hinton et al. BMC Pregnancy and Childbirth  (2018) 18:12 
Page 10 of 15
 decided what information was or was not reliable did
not emerge from these data.
“Informations are very good and easy to evaluate
however I feel much better to speak with midwife who
in my opinion should be more competent. I haven't
looked at any statistics[……] For me talking to my
friends was more important than statistics.” (Clara,
Focus Group 6, Opt-out AMU).
Some women explained that they trusted their friends
as a source of information because their opinions were
“Non biased” (Mandy, Focus group 4, first time mothers)
and based on their personal experiences: “Because
they’ve actually experienced it.” (Mae, Focus group 4,
first time mothers).
Some women mentioned seeking out statistics “I did a
lot of research on the internet for statistics.” (Rona, Focus
group 3, limited choice) and some explained how they used
“statistics” and “evidence” to support their choices but did
not talk about how they evaluated the information.
Discussion
This is the first large-scale study to our knowledge to
seek qualitative insights into how women make decisions
about where to give birth since the NICE intrapartum
care guidelines were updated in 2014. In the findings
reported here we focus on women’s information needs
and information sources which is something given con-
siderable emphasis in the updated NICE guideline. In
particular, those guidelines recommend that women
should be told that they may choose any birth setting
and should be given detailed information about the dif-
ferent birth settings available. This includes information
about rates of intervention and serious adverse out-
comes, and local statistics on access to a familiar mid-
wife and one-to-one care, access to medical staff, access
to pain relief and, for midwifery-led settings, the likeli-
hood of transfer, the reasons why transfer might happen
and the time it may take. Many of the women in our
study were not told this information by their midwives
and some were wholly unaware that statistics on inter-
vention rates were available.
Our findings suggest that women draw on a wide pool
of information sources to form their views. Hospital
reputation, word of mouth and friends’ experiences at
the maternity units were important factors in their own
decision-making. The sources of information for making
a choice about where to give birth that the women
described using included: the Internet, friends’ recom-
mendations and experiences, antenatal and birth prepar-
ation classes and their own personal experiences of
birth. Their midwife was not the main source of infor-
mation, with some saying their midwife appointments
felt rushed and there was not time to ask questions.
Women wanted to have the option to discuss birth pref-
erences with their midwife throughout their pregnancy.
Many women would like their midwives to provide in-
formation about all the options available to them includ-
ing further details about each option. Importantly,
women wanted something they could take away with
them, mull over and talk to others about and then have
a discussion with their midwife at a later time in their
pregnancy about their decision. Nevertheless, although
not reported here, some women commented that they
felt supported in their choices by their midwives.
The results of our study should be considered in the light
of a changing provision and information landscape. From
the provision side, the availability of midwifery-led options,
particularly AMUs, has expanded considerably in the past
5–10 years [4, 5]. This means that a greater proportion of
women now potentially have access to both an OU and at
least one midwifery unit (AMU or FMU) as well as the
option of a home birth, although some, including some of
our study participants, still may have only a limited choice
available, for example between an OU and home birth.
National survey data indicate that the proportion of women
being offered birth choices by their midwife is increasing.
The most recent nationally representative survey in 2015,
in which over 20,000 women were surveyed after their
birth, showed 41% reported that they had been offered a
midwifery unit and 39% a home birth and 58% reported
that they had received enough information from their
doctor or midwife to help them decide where to give birth
[6]. However, this leaves around 4 women in 10 not receiv-
ing sufficient information from their midwives or doctors.
Discussion in light of other literature
Previous qualitative [19, 20] and quantitative studies
[11, 21–24] from the early 1990s through to 2011
(reviewed more fully elsewhere [4]) found that women
were not necessarily aware that choice existed or be-
lieved that the only available choices were between
OUs. However, in some studies there were examples
illustrating that some women were adequately in-
formed and supported in their decisions by their
health care professionals [11, 25, 26]. Previous studies
also found that even where women were aware that
alternative options were available their choices were
sometimes blocked or discouraged by healthcare pro-
fessionals [27–31]. The most recent study of women’s
experience of birth place decision-making found that
midwives were influential, but did not always give full
information to women about all options [32].
By late pregnancy the women in our study appeared to
be more aware of their options and the right to choose
and many had chosen midwifery-led options with the
apparent support of their midwives, but a number of
Hinton et al. BMC Pregnancy and Childbirth  (2018) 18:12 
Page 11 of 15
 women commented on their own lack of knowledge
early in pregnancy. What is striking in our study, unlike
the women in the study by Barber et al. from ten years
ago [11], is that the midwife no longer appeared to be
the most important source of information. Many women
in our study had sought out information from other
sources rather than being provided with information
through a single channel by their midwife; some had to
ask questions in order to get information about their
options, and others had come across relevant informa-
tion by chance. Friends and family, [20, 30, 33–35], word
of mouth [33, 35] and women’s personal experiences of
birth [19, 27, 29, 33, 36–39] were important influences
on women’s decisions, as has been found previously but
the Internet appears to have become a much more
important source of information than has been reported
in previous studies.
Internet use for pregnancy related information seeking
is a global phenomenon [40, 41] and appears to be rela-
tively common in the UK. A recent national maternity
survey in England found that around three-quarters of
women used online sources – predominantly NHS web-
sites - for information relating to pregnancy and childbirth
[42]. As we saw in our study, women use the internet for a
variety of purposes, including for validating information,
empowering themselves, sharing experiences and assisting
decision-making, [43]. However, the internet is not neces-
sarily women’s preferred source of information [44, 45].
Previous studies have found that it is important for mid-
wives to initiate conversations about choice of birth place
[19, 20, 29] and our findings do not suggest that this has
changed. It is notable that many of the women in our
study appear to have sought information that guidelines
recommend should be provided by midwives [2].
As has been found in previous studies, our findings in-
dicate that information given by midwives early in preg-
nancy was sometimes felt to be superficial and too rushed
[19, 31] and women found it unhelpful to be given leaflets
with inadequate time for discussion [11, 31]. A number of
our study participants felt that decisions were taken too
soon and that they would have valued time to reflect on
their choices. Some of our participants had found out
about options at antenatal classes, which are typically
taken in the third trimester, a point at which decisions
have generally been taken about the place of birth.
Overall our findings suggest that choice might be en-
hanced by avoiding taking decisions about where to
give birth at a fixed time point and allowing options
and decisions to be reviewed throughout pregnancy.
This chimes with a recent systematic review exploring
midwives’ experiences which concluded that the place
of birth discussion needed to be taken at a time when
“…women are ready to engage with this information,
rather than automatically being given [the information]
at the booking visit when they may be overloaded with
information and not yet ready to consider their [place
of birth] options” [46]. The review further found that
midwives were not confident having place of birth dis-
cussions with women and that societal norms also
affect midwives as well as women. So promoting birth
in a non-OU setting as normal “needs to be facilitated
to change the current culture whereby women who
choose non-OU births are often perceived to be risk-
takers” [46].
Following the publication of Birthplace and the revised
NICE guidelines, local NHS initiatives have been devel-
oped to facilitate evidence-based conversations between
midwives and women about place of birth. Some focus
on providing information in a user-friendly paper format
(Tracey Cooper, personal communication, 9 January
2017) or have focused on developing training and
support materials for midwives (Beck Taylor, personal
communication, 7 December 2016). The Portsmouth
Birth Place choice project [11, 47] demonstrated that the
uptake of midwifery-led birth settings could be increased
through high-level organisational commitment and by
implementing specific measures including training and
support for midwives, to ensure that women are given
evidence-based
information
and
guidance.
The
Portsmouth project resulted in the development of the
My Birthplace app [48] which is now available for
women and midwives to use in a number of areas. Initia-
tives such as these have the potential to increase the
proportion of women who have access to informed
choice about place of birth.
Strengths and limitations
A key strength of our study is that it was conducted
after the 2014 update of the NICE intrapartum care
guidelines and thus in a period when planned birth in
a
midwifery-led
setting
was
recommended
as
the
most suitable option for low risk women. It is a na-
tional study that focused on inclusivity in its sampling
and innovative methodological approach using online
focus groups. This enabled us to include 69 women
with a good range of socio-economic groups, parity
and geographical spread across England. As well as
those who were very active in using the Internet to
find out information, we also had others (for example
Bridget, focus group 8, planning OU birth; Clara
Focus
group
6,
opt-out
AMU
areas)
who
didn’t
search for information about their choices on the
internet but followed the experience of family and
friends.
However, while using an online approach as a mechan-
ism to increase the range and inclusivity of our sample,
we must be mindful that our participants were therefore
likely to be Internet users, and skilled at online research,
Hinton et al. BMC Pregnancy and Childbirth  (2018) 18:12 
Page 12 of 15
 and were possibly more likely to be ‘active choosers’
(women who seek the information that they need to ex-
ercise choice) rather than ‘acceptors’ (who tend to ‘go
with the flow’) [49]. Our findings may not therefore fully
capture the experiences and needs of this latter group.
In
seeking
to
include
women
from
lower
socio-
economic groups we worked with a women’s support
group in east London to recruit women for our face to
face group. We were therefore unable to pre-screen the
women as we did for the online groups, and were unable
to collect the same biographical information about them.
While the online focus groups afforded many advan-
tages, we are also aware that there were limitations in
the depth of data we were able to capture using this
approach. The live chats were fast paced with women
often ‘talking’ (typing) over each other, and there was a
slight time lag. Therefore the ability to pick up on, and
explore, particular threads of conversation during these
live events was limited, in comparison to a face to face
focus group or indeed a one to one interview. While
questions were posed during the week on the message
boards, women did not necessarily respond to them.
Implications for policy and practice
While for our participants, midwives were not for the
most part the main source of information about their
birth place options, midwives continue to be an im-
portant ‘sounding board’ for women, most of whom
want to be able to talk about their options with their
midwife. Maternity care providers therefore need to
ensure that midwives are appropriately trained, have
access to user-friendly support materials and have ad-
equate time, so that all women, not just those who
will actively seek out information for themselves, are
aware of their options and can make informed deci-
sions. Consideration should be given to how best to
make reliable locally-tailored information readily avail-
able to women, covering options outside the woman’s
local NHS trust where appropriate. This information
might be online or in a format which midwives can
use directly with women. Midwives may need to be
more aware of existing online resources that women
may
access,
e.g.
Which?
Birth
Choice
[http://
www.which.co.uk/birth-choice/].
The
NHS
Choices
website, which currently does not give clear informa-
tion about the types of services (e.g. OU, AMU,
FMU) available at each hospital, might benefit from
enhancement. Irrespective of the information source,
women should have the opportunity to explore and
consider their options in their own time, and revisit
these later in pregnancy with their midwife. While it
is important that women are given information about
birth
place
options
early
in their pregnancy,
our
findings
support
an
approach
in
which
women’s
decision-making is an ongoing process, not a one-off
irrevocable choice.
Further research is required to determine the best way
of ensuring that women are aware that they have the right
to choose, are given appropriate information about their
options and have the opportunity to have their questions
answered by their midwife. New approaches, including the
development of digital technologies, may emerge from the
areas now designated as NHS ‘Maternity Choice and
Personalisation Pioneers’ [50] which will be testing ways
of improving choice and personalisation for women acces-
sing maternity services.
Conclusions
Our findings suggest that women may be encountering
fewer overt obstacles to exercising choice than in the past
but women do not consistently receive information about
birthplace options from their midwife at a time and in a for-
mat they find helpful. Women in some areas continue to
have a restricted range of options. Women’s ability to choose
a birth place that meets their needs and preferences could
probably be facilitated by presenting choice early in
pregnancy together with information, and possibly guidance
on online sources where additional reliable information can
be found, but it may be best to defer decision-making about
birth place until the woman has had time to consider and
discuss her options. Approaches should take into consider-
ation that, although women may access other sources of
information, women continue to want to be able to discuss
their preferences and options with their midwife.
