OBJECTIVES: To determine whether protein intake is asso-
ciated with better disability trajectories in the oldest adults
(≥85) and whether muscle mass and muscle strength would
partially mediate this.
DESIGN: Prospective cohort study.
SETTING:
Newcastle-upon-Tyne
and
North
Tyneside,
United Kingdom.
PARTICIPANTS: Community-dwelling older adults aged
85 at baseline (N=722).
METHODS: Protein intake was estimated using two 24-
hour multiple-pass recalls at baseline. Disability was mea-
sured as difficulty performing 17 activities of daily living at
baseline and 18, 36, and 60 months. Trajectories were
derived using mortality-adjusted group-based trajectory
modelling. The effect of protein intake (g/kg of adjusted
body weight (aBW)/d) on disability trajectories was exam-
ined using multinomial logistic regression.
RESULTS: Participants had 4 distinct disability trajectories
(between the ages of 85 and 90: constant very low (AT1), mild
(AT2), moderate (AT3), and severe (AT4). Each unit increase
in protein (g) per kg of aBW/d was associated with greater
odds of AT1 (odds ratio (OR=7.97, 95% confidence interval
(CI)=1.96–32.43, p = .004) and AT2 (OR=3.28, 95%
CI=1.09–9.87, p = .03) than of AT4 over 5 years in models
adjusted for selected covariates. Participants with protein
intake of 1.0 g/kg aBW/d or more were more likely to belong
to AT1 (OR=3.65, 95% CI=1.59–8.38, p = .009) and AT2
(OR=2.12, 95% CI=1.16–3.90, p = .01) than to AT4.
CONCLUSION: Higher protein intake, especially 1.0 g/kg
aBW/d or more, was associated with better disability trajec-
tories in the oldest adults. These findings will inform new
dietary strategies to support active, healthy ageing. J Am

T
he oldest adults (≥85) are the fastest growing age group
in most Western societies and are at high risk of disabil-
ity. Disability is defined as difficulty maintaining the status
quo in relation to the individual’s basic functioning care and
is measured according to activities of daily living (ADLs),
such as the ability to feed oneself, bathe, dress, and transfer
to and from the toilet. A more complex set of behaviors
focused on the ability of an individual to preserve indepen-
dence within the larger community (e.g., housekeeping and
managing finances) is used in combination with ADLs and
referred to as instrumental ADLs (IADLs). Difficulty per-
forming ADLs and IADLs is associated with a number of
adverse health outcomes, including mortality and poor qual-
ity of life.1,2 The percentage of very old adults in England
and Wales who require 24-hour care is projected to increase
by 82% from 2010 to 2030, resulting in need for an extra
63,000 care home places.3
Therefore, there is interest in slowing disability trajecto-
ries through modifiable risk factors, such as nutrition. Dietary
protein is a sensible candidate because it may slow decreases
in muscle mass and functional decline with aging.4–6 On aver-
age, protein intake is lower in older (66 � 17 g/d) than youn-
ger (91 � 22 g/d) adults7 because of multimorbidity, changes
in oral health and taste perception, and loss of independence.8

 For example, 28% of very old adults in northeast England
had protein intake below the recommended dietary allowance
(RDA) of 0.8 g per kg of adjusted body weight per day (g/kg
aBW/d).9 Furthermore, the greater incidence and prevalence
of multimorbidity in older adults can change protein require-
ments because of disease-related tissue catabolism and
inflammation.10,11 The current protein RDA for all adults is
based largely on short-term nitrogen balance studies con-
ducted in healthy young adults and does not take into
account functional outcomes, such as disability.12 This has
led others to propose that protein requirements are not the
same for young and older adults.8,11,13 Whether adequate
protein intake, mediated by better muscle strength, bone
health, and physical function, can delay the onset of disabil-
ity has been considered.14,15
There is limited research on the association between
protein intake and disability in older adults. Some observa-
tional studies have found that greater protein intake was
associated with lower prevalence and incidence of disability
in community-dwelling participants,5,16,17 although these
studies have limitations, including insufficient numbers of
very old adults, use of a shorter disability scale (higher
potential for floor and ceiling effects), failure to explore dis-
abilities longitudinally, and failure to account for mortality.
Our previous results have documented the prevalence of
low protein intake in very old adults and the association
with muscle strength,6,9 but disability is a more relevant
outcome for older people and for provision of care, and not
all ADLs are necessarily mediated by muscle strength. To
fill this gap, we aimed to determine the effect of protein
intake on disability progression over 5 years in a large,
sociodemographically representative cohort of 85-year old
individuals in northeast England. We hypothesized that
protein intake would be associated with disability trajectory
in the oldest adults and that muscle mass and muscle
strength would partially mediate this.
METHODS
Newcastle 85+ Study
Details of the Newcastle 85+ Study were previously pub-
lished.18 Briefly, the Newcastle 85+ Study is a longitudinal
population-based study that approached all people turning
85 in 2006 (born in 1921) in Newcastle-upon-Tyne and
North Tyneside, (UK) for participation. The recruited cohort
was
sociodemographically
representative
of the
general
U.K. population at the time and did not include individuals
with end-stage terminal illness.18 At baseline (2006–07),
722 community-dwelling participants (60% women) had
complete dietary intake data, body weight and height mea-
surements, multidimensional health assessment (including
disability), and complete general practice (GP) medical
records. A flowchart of the recruitment and retention profile
of the Newcastle 85+ Study is presented in Supplementary
Appendix S1 and Supplementary Figure S1. This study was
conducted according to the guidelines set out in the 1964
Declaration of Helsinki, and the Newcastle and North Tyne-
side local research ethics committee approved all procedures
involving human subjects (06/Q0905/2). Written informed
consent was obtained from all participants, and when that
was not possible, consent was obtained from a caregiver or a
relative according to the U.K. Mental Capacity Act 2005.
Protein Intake Estimation
Complete details of the dietary intake assessment can be
found elsewhere.19 Briefly, dietary intake was assessed
according to 24-hour multiple pass recall (24-h MPR) on
2 nonconsecutive occasions at baseline. Energy and protein
intake were estimated using McCance and Widdowson’s
sixth edition food composition tables.20 Body weight was
adjusted to reflect a healthy (desirable) body mass index
(BMI) in older adults of 22 to 27 kg/m2 and calculated as
described previously21 (more details in 9). The protein RDA
for all adults is 0.8 g/kg BW/d22,23 but there are proposals
to increase it to at least 1.0 g/kg BW/d for older adults.8
Accordingly, protein intake was expressed as g/kg aBW/d,
below or above 0.8 g/kg aBW/d and below or above 1.0 g/kg
aBW/d.6,9
Disability
A disability score was created by summing 17 self-reported
ADLs, IADLs, and mobility limitations, with each partici-
pant scoring 1 for each activity that could not be performed
or was performed with any difficulty and 0 without diffi-
culty. The disability score was calculated at baseline
and
after
18,
36,
and
at
60
months
of
follow-up
(Supplementary Figure S2). Ability to perform activities
involving
predominantly
lower
limb
mobility
(getting
around the house, getting in and out of a chair, shopping
for groceries, going up and down stairs, walking at least
400 yards (370 m)) was strongly related to Timed Up-and-
Go test performance, which validated the self-reported
ADLs, IADLs and mobility items.24
Baseline Socioeconomic, Lifestyle, and Health Factors
All baseline variables were assessed between June 2006 and
October 2007. Participants were categorized into those
who had spent up to 9 years, 10 to 11 years, or 12 or more
years in full-time education. We also categorized subjects
into low (scores 0–1), medium (scores 2–6), and high
(scores 7–18) physical activity groups based on a purpose-
designed and validated physical activity questionnaire25 and
into those with none or at least one swallowing problem
(including dry mouth). BMI was calculated as body weight
(kg) divided by height2 (m). Fat-free mass was estimated
using a body fat analyzer (Tanita-305, Tanita Corp.,
Tokyo, Japan). Disease count was created by scoring the
most prevalent 7 chronic diseases as present (1) or absent
(0)
(cardiac,
respiratory,
and
cerebrovascular
disease;
arthritis; hypertension; diabetes mellitus; and cancer in past
5 years)26; global cognition was assessed using the Stan-
dardized Mini-Mental State Examination (SMMSE), with a
score less than 26 indicating cognitive impairment; and
depression was assessed using the 15-item Geriatric Depres-
sion Scale (GDS). Serum albumin was measured using an
automated version of the Bromocresol Green method.27

LOW PROTEIN AND DISABILITY TRAJECTORIES
51
 Statistical Analysis
Group-based trajectory models (GBTMs) were used to
derive the optimum number of disability trajectories from
age 85 to age 90. The model was extended to account for
nonrandom participant attrition (predominantly mortality),
with a link function for dropout probability according to
age and based on previous response.28 Maximum likeli-
hood was used to estimate the model parameters and mean
disability count, followed a censored normal distribution.
The optimum number of disabilities and model fit was
assessed using the Bayesian Information Criteria and by
confirming that the posterior probability of group member-
ship was greater than 75%.29
For continuous variables, normality was tested using
the Shapiro–Wilk test and confirmed using Q-Q plots.
Normally distributed data were presented as means and
standard deviations, and non-Gaussian distributed vari-
ables as medians and interquartile ranges. Categorical data
were presented as percentages (with corresponding sam-
ple size).
The association between protein intake and disability
trajectory was examined using multinomial logistic regres-
sion. Briefly, important variables were selected according to
their clinical and theoretical relevance and univariate analy-
sis with the disability trajectories. These variables were then
fitted, removed, and refitted until the best possible but most
parsimonious model was achieved while checking for model
fit statistics throughout. Model 1 included only the intercept
and protein intake (g/kg aBW/d) (continuous) or protein
intake dichotomized at 1.0 g/kg aBW/d, Model 2 was fur-
ther adjusted for sex and years spent in full-time education,
Model 3 included further terms for total energy intake and
physical activity, and Model 4 was also adjusted for
SMMSE score and number of chronic diseases. Missing
values (physical activity, n = 1; years in full-time education,
n = 4; and SMMSE score, n = 1) were inputted with the
mode (medium physical activity, 9 years spent in education)
or the mean (SMMSE score 26.8) for the logistic regression
models.
Disability trajectories were derived using Stata version
15.0 (package traj) (Stata Corp., College Station, TX) and
the resulting estimates plotted using R version 3.2.2 (pack-
age ggplot2) (Statistics Department, University of Auckland,
New Zealand). Most other statistical analysis were con-
ducted using SPSS version 22.0 (IBM Corp., Armonk, NY).
P < .05 was used to indicate statistical significance and
point estimates (with confidence intervals (CIs)) to indicate
clinical significance.
RESULTS
Disability Trajectories
The disability trajectories (3 linear, 1 quadratic) were best
represented using a 4-group model. Trajectories are plot-
ted in Figure 1 and described in detail in Supplementary
Table
S1.
These
trajectories
were
slightly
different
from previously derived disability trajectories in a different
sample of the Newcastle 85+ Study.26 Briefly, participants
had 4 distinct disability trajectories between the ages of
85 and 90: AT1, a constant very low disability trajectory
(group size: 11.3%); AT2, low disability to increasing
mild disability (group size: 35.0%); AT3, mild disability
increasing to moderate disability (group size: 33.9%); and
AT4, moderate disability increasing to severe disability
(group size: 19.8%). All disability trajectories increased
gradually with advancing age, except for the very low dis-
ability trajectory (AT1), whose participants had 0 or 1 dis-
abilities at baseline and over 5 years. Those in the least
favorable trajectory (AT4) had difficulty with a mean of
9 disability items at age 85 and progressed to 14 by age
90. The dropout rate (mostly through death) was also
higher in trajectories with more disabilities. Three similar
trajectories, each of which also revealed gradually increas-
ing disability with advancing age, best represented disabil-
ity trajectories for women (all linear trajectories) and men
(2
linear,
1
quadratic
trajectory)
(Supplementary
Figure S3). Because the trajectories were similar (but not
the group sizes), we analyzed women and men combined
to increase power to detect different trajectories.
Socioeconomic, Lifestyle, and Health Factors Differed
According to Disability Trajectories
More women, more participants with swallowing problems,
those who had lost more than 5% of their body weight in
the past 3 years, who did not drink alcohol, who were less
physically active, who had greater cognitive impairment,
who had more chronic diseases (e.g those in AT1 had, on
average, 1 less chronic disease than those in the AT4), and
who had higher GDS scores were in trajectories with
greater disability (Table 1).
Association Between Protein Intake and Disability
Trajectory
Participants with higher protein intake (g/kg aBW/d) at
baseline were more likely to have a low (AT1) and mild
(AT2) disability trajectory than a severe disability trajec-
tory (AT4) in unadjusted models (odds ratio (OR)=3.23,
95% CI=1.41–7.36, p = .005), and in models adjusted for
sex, education, total energy, physical activity, SMMSE
score ,and number of chronic diseases (OR=.97, 95%
CI=1.96–32.43, p = .004) (Table 2). This relationship was
not apparent when protein intake was dichotomized at
0.8 g/kg aBW/d (current RDA for protein) (Supplementary
Table S2), but it became evident for protein intake dichot-
omized at 1.0 g/kg aBW/d in unadjusted and fully adjusted
models (Supplementary Table S3). Participants with pro-
tein intake of 1.0 g/kg aBW/d or greater were more likely
to be in the low (AT1) (OR=3.65, 95% CI=1.59–8.38,
p = .002) or mild (AT2) disability trajectory (OR=2.12,
95% CI=1.16–3.90, p = 0.015) than the severe disability
trajectory (AT4). As a sensitivity analysis, models were
also adjusted for free-fat mass or grip strength. This
adjustment
decreased
the
association
between
protein
intake and disability trajectories (e.g., participants with
protein intake ≥1 g/kg aBW/d: AT1 vs AT4 (OR=3.04,
95% CI=1.26–7.35, p = .01) and AT2 vs AT4 (OR=1.88,
95% CI=1.00–3.54, p = .05)). Details of the sensitivity

DISCUSSION
Main Findings
Consistent with our hypothesis, we showed that people
aged 85.0 years old (� 0.5) with greater protein intake
(g/kg aBW/d) were more likely to have fewer disabilities at
baseline and shallower disability trajectories over the subse-
quent 5 years, after adjusting for covariates. These observa-
tions are unique because of the large number of very old
adults, the wide array of disability measures, and the use of
mortality-adjusted GBTM. Theoretically, this would mean
that a sustained increase in intake of 0.1 g of protein/kg
aBW/d (7 g/d of protein for a 70-kg individual, e.g., equiva-
lent to 1 glass [200 mL] of semiskim milk) increased the
chance of having a shallow disability trajectory (AT1) by
20% and a mild disability trajectory (AT2) by 13%. The
protective effect was more pronounced in participants with
protein intake of 1.0 g/kg aBW/d or more. This observation
provides objective evidence in support of recommendations
from expert groups such as PROT-AGE and the European
Society for Clinical Nutrition and Metabolism study group,
who have proposed an increase in the protein RDA for older
adults from 0.8 to 1.0 to 1.2 g/kg per day.8,11
Evidence from Other Studies
Our observations are consistent with those from a number
of observational studies.5,16,17,30,31 For example, more than
110,000 postmenopausal women aged 50 to 70 from the
Women’s Health Initiative were followed for a mean of
11.5 years.5 Women with higher protein intake (measured
at baseline using a food frequency questionnaire) (highest
quintile: 1.19 � 0.20 g/kg BW/d) had better self-reported
physical function and a slower rate of functional decline
(assessed using the Medical Outcomes Study 36-item Short-
Form Survey with 10 disability items).5 Another study
found that older adults from the Health, Aging, and Body
Composition
Study
(almost
2,000
community-dwelling
adults aged 70–79) with protein intake less than 1.0 g/kg
aBW/d were at greater risk of developing mobility limita-
tions over 6 years.30 Studies in different settings with differ-
ent designs and shorter follow-up periods have found more
mixed
results.32,33
A
12-week
intervention
trial
with
protein-enriched foods and drinks in 75 older adults (mean
age 76.8) followed for 6 months after hospital discharge
did not show an effect of higher protein intake (112 g/d vs
78 g/d) on incidence of difficulty performing ADLs.32
Loss of muscle strength is related to selected functional
limitations.34 A previous study found that participants in
the Newcastle 85+ Study with higher protein intake (≥1 g/
kg aBW/d) and high physical activity had the best perfor-
mance on the grip strength test and less muscle strength
decline over 5 years.6 The same effect was not present in
those who had higher protein intake and low physical
activity or low protein intake and high physical activity,6
suggesting that adequate protein combined with physical
activity is required to optimally stimulate myofibrillar pro-
tein synthesis or at least reduce muscle strength loss in very
old adults.8,11 Our sensitivity analyses considered a possible
interaction between protein intake and physical activity, but
because of the small numbers of individuals with low physi-
cal activity and few disabilities (and high physical activity
in those in the severe disability trajectories) this could not
be inspected fully. We hypothesized that muscle mass and
muscle strength partly mediated the observed association
between
protein
intake
and
disability
trajectories.
In
our sensitivity analyses, models were further adjusted for
Figure 1. Disability trajectories with 95% confidence intervals of all participants. Percentages denote group sizes. Points are aver-
ages. Disability score was calculated by adding activity of daily living (ADL), instrumental activity of daily living (IADL), and
mobility limitations. AT1=constant very low disability; AT2=low disability increasing to mild disability; AT3=mild disability
increasing to moderate disability; AT4=moderate disability increasing to severe disability.

 free-fat mass or grip strength, and the coefficients changed
only slightly, indicating that muscle mass and muscle
strength only partially mediate the possible protective effect
of high protein intake on disability trajectories in very old
adults or that this is only on the pathway of certain disabil-
ities, such as mobility limitations.
Strengths and Weaknesses
The uniqueness of our approach lies with the large number
of very old (sociodemographically representative) adults
included in our study, the comprehensive multidimensional
health data collected, and the large range of ADLs used
(mobility items validated against Timed Up-and-Go test).24
Another major strength of the present investigation was the
use of mortality-adjusted GBTM to determine the relation-
ship between protein intake at baseline and disability trajec-
tories over 5 years. Attrition was high in this age group,35
and it is likely that failure to account for mortality resulted
in biased trajectory group sizes.28
A limitation of our investigation is that some disability
transitions might have not been captured because disability
was assessed every 18 months (24 months in the last phase)
over the 5 years of follow-up. The model-building strategy

day), Model 2 is further adjusted for sex and education, Model 3 includes further terms for total energy intake and physical activity, and Model 4 is also
adjusted for Standardized Mini-Mental State Examination score and number of chronic diseases.

 was comprehensive and adjusted for several important con-
founders, but because healthy behaviors (e.g., greater physi-
cal activity, healthier diet, not smoking) cluster together,36
it is possible that higher protein intake served as a proxy
for healthy behavior(s) that were unaccounted for. Disabil-
ities such as difficulty feeding, cooking a hot meal, or shop-
ping for groceries can lead to lower food intake and,
ultimately, to lower protein intake. Although protein intake
was measured at baseline, and disabilities were measured
prospectively over 5 years, these analyses are prone to
reverse causality.
CONCLUSIONS
In models adjusted for socioeconomic, health, and lifestyle
factors, in the oldest adults, higher protein intake, especially
1.0 g/kg aBW/d or greater, was associated with a shallower
disability trajectory over the following 5 years. The results
support the consensus statements that protein intake in
older adults should approximate 1.0 to 1.2 g/kg BW/d,
which is within the acceptable macronutrient distribution
range. As part of the PRevention Of Malnutrition In Senior
Subjects in the European Union (PROMISS) project (http://
www.promiss-vu.eu/ for more information), these results
will inform development of dietary strategies to support
healthy aging and be tested for effectiveness and cost-
effectiveness in a long-term trial.
