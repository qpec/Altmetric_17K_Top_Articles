Abstract Food insecurity is associated with negative
chronic health outcomes, yet few studies have examined
how providing medically appropriate food assistance to
food-insecure individuals may improve health outcomes
in resource-rich settings. We evaluated a community-
based food support intervention in the San Francisco
Bay Area for people living with HIV and/or type 2
diabetes mellitus (T2DM) to determine the feasibility,
acceptability, and potential impact of the intervention
on nutritional, mental health, disease management,
healthcare utilization, and physical health outcomes.
The 6-month intervention provided meals and snacks
designed to comprise 100% of daily energy requirements
and meet nutritional guidelines for a healthy diet. We
assessed paired outcomes at baseline and 6 months using
validated measures. Paired t tests and McNemar exact
tests were used with continuous and dichotomous out-
comes, respectively, to compare pre-post changes.
Fifty-two participants (out of 72 initiators) had both
baseline and follow-up assessments, including 23 with
HIV, 24 with T2DM, and 7 with both HIV and T2DM.
Median food pick-up adherence was 93%. Comparing
baseline to follow-up, very low food security decreased
from 59.6% to 11.5% (p<0.0001). Frequency of con-
sumption of fats (p=0.003) decreased, while frequency
increased for fruits and vegetables (p=0.011). Among
people with diabetes, frequency of sugar consumption
decreased (p=0.006). We also observed decreased de-
pressive symptoms (p = 0.028) and binge drinking
(p=0.008). At follow-up, fewer participants sacrificed
food for healthcare (p = 0.007) or prescriptions
(p=0.046), or sacrificed healthcare for food (p=0.029).

 Among people with HIV, 95% adherence to antiretroviral
therapy increased from 47 to 70% (p=0.046). Among
people with T2DM, diabetes distress (p<0.001), and
perceived diabetes self-management (p = 0.007) im-
proved. Comprehensive, medically appropriate food sup-
port is feasible and may improve multiple health out-
comes for food-insecure individuals living with chronic
health conditions. Future studies should formally test the
impact of medically appropriate food support interven-
tions for food-insecure populations through rigorous,
randomized controlled designs.

Introduction
Food insecurity is a barrier to health and well-being [1,
2]. Thirteen percent of US households, or 42 million
people, are food-insecure [3], with low-income house-
holds and households headed by racial/ethnic minorities
disproportionately affected [3]. Food insecurity increases
the risk of acquisition of and poor outcomes associated
with both infectious and non-communicable diseases [4,
5]. In HIV, food insecurity is associated with increased
risk of HIV acquisition [6] and transmission [7,8], poor
medication adherence [9, 10], worse immunologic [10,
11] and virologic outcomes [10, 12, 13], morbidity [14],
and mortality [15]. In diabetes, food insecurity is associ-
ated with increased risk of type 2 diabetes mellitus
(T2DM) [4], poorer diabetes self-management [16, 17],
poorer glycemic (i.e., blood sugar) control [4], and in-
creased hypoglycemic events [18]. Our previously pub-
lished conceptual framework posits that food insecurity
negatively impacts health through nutritional (e.g.,
weight, diet quality), mental health (e.g., depression,
stress), and behavioral pathways (e.g., medication adher-
ence and disease self-management) [19, 20]. Intervention
research is needed to understand not only whether med-
ically appropriate food assistance may improve health but
also to test whether food insecurity may be causally
related to negative health outcomes.
There is a critical need for effective programs to
improve the health of food-insecure populations with
chronic illness or risk factors for chronic illness [19, 20].
Sixty percent of food-insecure US households have
participated in at least one federal food and nutrition
assistance program, the largest being the Supplemental
Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP, called Cal-Fresh
in California) [21]. SNAP benefits may be insufficient
for people with chronic illness to access healthy foods,
which tend to cost more than less healthy foods [22–24].
In addition, many food-insecure individuals are exclud-
ed from participation in the federal food safety-net: in
2012, almost 30% of food-insecure households in the
US had incomes above the eligibility thresholds for
federal nutrition assistance [25]; SNAP also excludes
undocumented immigrants. In California, the state with
the second largest number of HIV diagnoses [26],
individuals who receive Supplemental Security Income
(SSI), a common source of disability income, are ex-
cluded from participating in SNAP [27].
Community-based food support programs, including
food banks, food pantries, soup kitchens, and meal deliv-
ery organizations, fill important gaps in the federal and
state food safety-nets, particularly in urban settings [25].
Some longstanding organizations—primarily serving
chronically ill populations in large urban areas—have
promoted that “food is medicine,” i.e., providing medi-
cally appropriate food to chronically ill populations, can
improve health and reduce healthcare costs [28]. Yet few
studies—none for HIVand few for diabetes [29] —have
prospectively tested the role of community-based food
assistance programs in improving the health of chronical-
ly ill individuals [30]. Little is known about whether, and
through what mechanisms, nutritionally comprehensive,
medically appropriate food assistance (i.e., designed to
meet medical recommendations for specific health popu-
lations) can improve health outcomes for low-income,
chronically ill populations.
88
Palar et al.
 To address these gaps, we conducted a study to
evaluate the feasibility, acceptability, and potential im-
pact [31] of Food = Medicine, a novel, medically ap-
propriate 6-month food assistance intervention. We hy-
pothesized that the intervention would improve nutri-
tion, mental health, and health behaviors [19, 20].
Methods
Study Design
We assessed changes in nutritional and health outcomes
among chronically ill individuals before and after the 6-
month Food = Medicine intervention. Our study includ-
ed people with HIV and/or T2DM because our previ-
ously published conceptual framework suggested simi-
lar mechanisms may govern the relationship between
food insecurity and health in these groups [20].
Population and Recruitment
The study was conducted in partnership with Project Open
Hand (POH), a San Francisco Bay Area-based non-profit
organization that provides food assistance to individuals
living with life-threatening and chronic illnesses, and to
seniors. POH provides free meals and groceries to over
8000 clients either with HIV
, other critical illnesses, or
who are seniors. POH began serving people with T2DM
around the same time as Food = Medicine was implement-
ed, having served people with HIV for over 20 years.
POH eligibility criteria for the Food = Medicine inter-
vention were: being (or in the process of becoming) a
current POH client, certified by a physician as living with
HIVand/or T2DM, English- or Spanish-speaking, age 18
or older, and low-income under ∼300% federal poverty
line. For clients who had accessed regular services for at
least 6 months, POH selected clients with service adher-
ence >75% to maximize intervention fidelity. Clients
requiring home-delivered meals or a special diet such as
a renal, full vegetarian, or vegan diet were excluded from
the intervention to simplify procedures, although plans
are underway to expand to these groups in the future.
Clients meeting the inclusion criteria were identified
from a master list of POH clients, and recruited into the
intervention until capacity was reached. After POH had
recruited participants, but before the start of the interven-
tion, the UCSF study team invited all participants to take
part in the evaluation of Food = Medicine. All Food =
Medicine clients were eligible to participate in the eval-
uation, but participation in the evaluation was not man-
datory to receive the intervention.
Food = Medicine Intervention Description
The Food = Medicine intervention was developed in
consultation with POH nutritionists and the study inves-
tigators, and implemented by POH from April 2014 to
June 2015. The intervention provided meals and snacks
fulfilling 100% of daily caloric requirements, tailored to
meet nutritional guidelines for a healthy diet. Average
energy requirements used to design daily meals were
1800–2000 kcal for people living with HIV and

 1800 kcal for people with T2DM. This threshold
evolved to account for varied energy requirements ex-
perienced by individuals of different size and metabolic
needs. Meal plans varied each week but were the same
across HIV and T2DM groups (see examples in
Table 1). Meal plans were based on the Mediterranean
diet featuring fresh fruits and vegetables, lean proteins,
healthy fats (e.g., olive oil), and whole grains, and were
low in refined sugars and saturated fats. The carbohy-
drate and saturated fat levels were set based on current
recommendations from the American Diabetes Associ-
ation and American Heart Association, respectively. All
food was fresh, with limited pre-packaged food offered
as snacks or grocery items (e.g., yogurt, sliced bread).
Participants (or a surrogate) picked up their food twice
per week at designated times from POH facilities.
Data Collection
Trained, master’s level research staff independent of
POH conducted in-person survey interviews and anthro-
pometric assessments, and coordinated blood draws (for
participants with diabetes only). Survey topics broadly
covered food security and nutrition, mental health and
psychosocial outcomes, substance use, healthcare be-
haviors, and health status. Height and weight were mea-
sured. Phlebotomy was performed by certified phlebot-
omists using universal precautions. Participants were
reimbursed $20 cash after each interview (including
anthropometry) and $10 for completing the blood draw.
Measures
Nutritional Measures We measured food security using
the USDA Household Food Security Survey Module
(HFSSM) [3, 32], which categorizes individuals as hav-
ing high, marginal, low, or very low food security over
the previous 6 months (Cronbach’s alpha 0.906). Diet
quality was assessed using the 18-item Multifactor
Screener [33], tailored to be relevant to low-income
populations with HIV and/or diabetes. The screener
assesses frequency of consumption of different types
of foods in the previous 30 days; values were then
converted to “times per day” participants consumed
vegetables and fruits, protein, grains, starches, and dairy.
We assessed height using a wall-mounted Seca
stadiometer and weight using a Health O Meter scale
(402KL). Body mass index (BMI) was then calculated
as kg/m2.
Mental Health and Substance Use Measures We
assessed depressive symptoms using the Patient Health
Questionnaire (PHQ-9) [34], with higher scores indicat-
ing higher depressive symptoms (probable depression
≥10). We assessed hazardous drinking using the Alcohol
Use Disorders Identification Test (AUDIT-C) [35]
(score >4 for men and >3 for women), and measured
binge drinking as having five or more drinks at one
occasion in the past 30 days. We also assessed current
smoking (currently smoked every day, some days, or not
at all) and illicit drug use (used crack/cocaine, metham-
phetamines, and/or heroin over the past 90 days (yes/
no), and how many days in the past 90 days used any of
these drugs).
Healthcare Behaviors Competing demands were cap-
tured by asking how often the participant had to go
without food because they needed the money for
healthcare, or vice versa. We assessed acute-care utili-
zation in the previous 90 days as the number of emer-
gency department (ED) visits and hospitalizations as the
number of overnight stays in a hospital bed.
HIV-Specific Measures We assessed internalized HIV
stigma using the negative self-image subscale of the
HIV Stigma Scale [36, 37]; higher scores indicated
higher levels of stigma (Cronbach’s alpha 0.875). Self-
reported antiretroviral therapy (ART) adherence in the
previous 7 days was assessed using the visual analog
scale (VAS). Non-adherence was defined as <95% ad-
herence [38, 39].
Diabetes-Specific Measures We assessed diabetes-
specific distress using the Diabetes Distress Scale
(DDS) [40], with higher scores indicating higher levels
of distress (Cronbach’s alpha 0.902). Diabetes self-
efficacy was assessed using the Perceived Diabetes
Self-Management Scale (PDSMS) [41]; higher scores
indicated higher self-efficacy (Cronbach’s alpha 0.893).
Fasting blood sugar and HbA1c were assessed via blood
draw and analyzed by Quest Diagnostics using spectro-
photometry and immunoturbidimetry, respectively.
Higher levels of fasting glucose and HbA1c indicate
worse current and longer-term glycemic control,
respectively.
Demographics and Socioeconomic Status We collected
information on age, gender [42], race/ethnicity, non-US
nativity, educational attainment, partnership status,
90

 location of receiving POH services, employment status,
annual household income, savings, and receipt of gov-
ernment benefits.
Process Measures We assessed program adherence
(percentage of pick-ups attended by the participant or
surrogate) using POH administrative records. Self-
reported process outcomes included (1) reasons for
missing pick-ups, (2) quantity of intervention food eat-
en, (3) prevalence and frequency of throwing away
intervention food, (4) prevalence and frequency of shar-
ing intervention food, and persons with whom food was
shared, and (5) frequency and sources of non-
intervention food eaten.
Analysis
We computed means and standard deviations for con-
tinuous variables, and proportions for categorical vari-
ables, separately for study completers and non-com-
pleters. We tested differences in baseline characteristics
between these two groups using two sample t tests and
χ2 tests.
To compare pre-post changes in outcomes, we used
paired t tests and McNemar exact tests with continuous
and dichotomous outcomes, respectively. We compared
pre-post outcomes for the study group as a whole, as
well as by HIVand T2DM status. We considered a pre-
post difference to be statistically significant at α=0.05
for a one-tailed test. Stata 14 (Stata Corp., College
Station, TX, USA) was used.
Ethics Statement
The Human Research Protection Program (HRPP) of
the University of California, San Francisco (UCSF)
approved the study. Participation in the study was vol-
untary and had no impact on the receipt of services from
POH or participation in the intervention. Informed writ-
ten consent was obtained from all participants.
Results
Sample Characteristics
We completed baseline assessments on all 72 partic-
ipants who initiated the Food = Medicine interven-
tion. Of these, 56 (77.8%) completed the
intervention, and 52 (72.2%) completed both the
intervention and follow-up study assessments
(Fig. 1). Compared to study completers, non-
completers were significantly more likely to be based
in Alameda County compared to San Francisco
County, be of younger age, have lower educational
attainment, and lower average income (Table 2).
Among study completers, 23 individuals were living
with HIValone, 22 were living with T2DM alone, and 7
had a dual HIV/T2DM diagnosis (Table 2). Most par-
ticipants identified as men (65.1%) and were between
50 and 64 years of age (71.2%). Less than one third of
participants identified as white or Caucasian (28.9%).
The majority had attained a high school degree/GED or
higher (86.5%). Only 17.3% were employed; the ma-
jority were receiving either SSI and/or SSDI (65.4%),
and 21.6% were receiving SNAP/CalFresh (i.e., “food
stamps”). On average, the median time participants were
POH clients before starting the intervention was
212 months, or about 17 years [interquartile range
(IQR) 42.6, 560], but differed by condition. By condi-
tion, median months as a POH client were 435 [IQR
213, 569] (HIV) and 1.08 [IQR 0, 60.4] (T2DM).
Compared to participants living with HIV, those with
T2DM were more likely to be older, female, African
American, employed, and receiving SNAP benefits, and
less likely to have a high school education and to be
receiving SSI or SSDI (table not shown).
Changes during the Food = Medicine Intervention
Over the course of the study, we observed a significant
decrease in the severity of food insecurity experienced
by participants (Fig. 2). Very low food security affected
59.6% of participants at baseline and only 11.5% at
follow-up. Likewise, high food security was infrequent
at baseline (9.62%) and experienced by the majority at
follow-up (53.9%). Differences in food insecurity over
time were statistically significant at p<0.0001. The HIV
and T2DM groups experienced similar changes in food
insecurity.
Diet quality changed across several domains over the
course of the study in the overall sample (Table 3). The
frequency of consuming fatty foods decreased from
3.19 times per day to 2.21 times (p=0.003), while the
frequency of consuming fruits and vegetables increased
from 1.85 to 2.34 times per day (p=0.011). We ob-
served a trend in decreased frequency of consumption
of sugary foods (p = 0.07); however, this was only
Food Support Improves HIVand Diabetes Health
91
 statistically significant in the T2DM group among
whom consumption of sugary foods or drinks decreased
from 0.994 to 0.650 times per day (p=0.006) (diabetes-
specific results not shown in table). In addition, average
BMI decreased from 31.2 at baseline to 30.1 at follow-
up (p=0.08) in the overall group. Among participants
with T2DM, BMI decreased from 36.1 at baseline to
34.8 at follow-up (p=0.035); among participants with
HIV, BMI did not change meaningfully from the base-
line of 25.3 (disease-specific results not shown in table).
While only one person in the overall sample was under-
weight at baseline, this individual was no longer under-
weight at follow-up.
Mental health and substance use also changed over
the course of the study for the overall sample (Table 3).
Compared to baseline, participants at follow-up had
significantly fewer depressive symptoms (7.58 to 5.84;
p =0.028). Furthermore, participants reporting binge
drinking decreased from 26.0 to 13.5% (p=0.008). In
addition, we observed decreases related to substance use
that were not statistically significant, including de-
creased prevalence of hazardous drinking (17.3 to
13.5%, p=0.31) and current smoking (44.2 to 38.5%,
p=0.19).
We investigated trends in competing needs and
acute-care utilization between baseline and follow-up

 healthcare (decreased from 38.5 to 19.2%, p=0.007) or
spend money on prescriptions (decreased from 28.9 to
15.4%, p=0.046). Although not statistically significant,
there were decreased tendencies of having at least one
hospitalization in the previous 3 months (15.7 to 5.77%,
p=0.11) and reporting at least one ED visit (26.9 to
17.3%, p=0.15). In the DM group, hospitalizations fell
from 25.0 to 6.90% (p=0.09) and ED visits from 31.0 to
13.8% (p=0.09). In the HIV group, hospitalizations fell
from 10.0 to 3.33% (p=0.31), while the number of ED
visits did not change (disease-specific results not shown
in Table 3).
Finally, we examined HIV- and T2DM-specific
health outcomes (Table 4). Among participants with
HIV, ARV medication adherence of 95% or greater
increased from 46.7% of participants at baseline to
70.0% of participants at follow-up (p=0.046). In addi-
tion, there was a decrease in internalized HIV stigma
scores 12.2 to 11.5 (p=0.21) which was not statistically
significant.
Among participants with T2DM, diabetes distress
scores decreased from 2.64 to 2.02 (p<0.001) and per-
ceived diabetes self-management scores increased from
24.8 to 27.3 (p = 0.007). Finally, mean HbA1c was
9.23% at baseline and 8.75% at follow-up (p=0.41),
but this difference was not statistically significant. We
also saw a higher prevalence of optimal glycemic con-
trol (defined as HbA1c <7%) [10.3 to 19.2%; p=0.08].
Process Outcomes
The median adherence to food pick-ups was 93% based
on administrative records (IQR 83, 100) (Table 5). The
most common reasons participants reported for missing
a pick-up were being too sick or injured to pick up food
(38.5%), arrived too late (28.8%), having a healthcare
appointment (25.0%), having a surrogate that did not
follow through on the pick-up (21.2%), and having a
logistical (not financial) transportation problem
(19.2%). While almost 78.9% of participants reported
eating all or most of the intervention food in a usual
week, 90.4% reported throwing away intervention food
at some point, 84.6% reported ever sharing intervention
food with others, and 57.8% reported sharing interven-
tion food at least once per week. Among participants
who shared intervention food, they most commonly
shared with friends (56.8%), neighbors (52.3%), and a
spouse or partner (25.0%). Finally, almost 78.9% report-
ed eating non-intervention foods at least once per week;
only 3.9% reported never eating non-intervention food.
Among those who consumed non-intervention foods,
the most commonly consumed non-intervention foods
were sweet snacks or desserts (76.9%), fast food
(75.0%), vegetables (75.0%), and fruits (71.2%).
Discussion
Provision of comprehensive, medically appropriate food
assistance was feasible for both HIV and diabetes. Our
results show that providing this assistance may improve
outcomes for both conditions in food-insecure popula-
tions. Further rigorous testing of the intervention is
needed to provide evidence as to whether policies to
promote medically appropriate food assistance in chron-
ically ill, economically distressed populations are
merited.
The Food = Medicine intervention is part of a
broader, nationwide “Food is Medicine” coalition [43]
to mobilize food and nutrition safety-net programs and
policies to mitigate the negative health, quality of life,
and economic impacts of chronic illness. Nutrition-
focused HIV service organizations are central in this
coalition, supported by dedicated federal healthcare
funding for nutritional wrap-around services via the
Ryan White Care Act. The coalition includes organiza-
tions serving individuals with many life-threatening
and/or chronic illnesses, particularly conditions for
which access to a healthy diet is paramount, such as
diabetes and heart disease. Rigorous evaluation of med-
ically tailored meal services that may have concrete
health impacts across diverse conditions is needed, es-
pecially given expanding opportunities to provide or

 reimburse nutrition services (including food) via Med-
icaid, Medicare, and private insurance under the Afford-
able Care Act [28].
Over 6 months, we observed significant improve-
ments in food security and in outcomes related to all
three mechanisms through which we posited food inse-
curity may impact HIV and diabetes health (nutritional,
mental health, and behavioral). We observed dramatic
improvements in depression, diabetes distress, diabetes
self-management, trading-off between food and
healthcare, and HIV medication adherence. Despite in-
sufficient power to detect improvements in HbA1c or
acute-care utilization, our results suggested possible
improvements in glycemic control and reduced hospi-
talizations and ED visits among participants with
T2DM.
While a growing literature has documented the mostly
positive impacts of food assistance on medication adher-
ence and other outcomes for people with HIV in low-
income countries [44, 45], the USA and other high-
income countries lack parallel studies. Among people
with diabetes, a recent prospective study in the USA
suggests that medically appropriate “food boxes” tailored
for a diabetic diet, provided together with diabetes self-
management and linkage to care, may improve glycemic
control and other markers of diabetes health, including
fruit and vegetable intake, self-management, and medi-
cation adherence [29]. The study observed improvements
in diabetes distress and HbA1c of similar magnitude as
our study. Two observational studies showed that medi-
cally appropriate food support may be associated with
fewer missed appointments [46] as well as decreased

 acute-care utilization and healthcare costs [47]. Our study
is one of the first to prospectively evaluate comprehen-
sive, medically appropriate food assistance for people
with chronic illness in high-income countries.
The focus on medically appropriate food assistance
embodied by Food = Medicine and other similar inter-
ventions is especially salient given the need to address
concurrent food insecurity and obesity in chronically ill
populations. HIV-specific food assistance in resource-
poor settings is generally tailored for underweight pop-
ulations, although treated populations with HIV increas-
ingly have higher BMIs [48, 49]. We previously showed
that providing energy-dense forms of food assistance to
overweight or obese, food-insecure individuals with
treated HIV infection leads to weight gain [50], increas-
ing the risk for chronic comorbidities. In contrast, our
study suggests that providing three meals a day plus
snacks that meet 100% of daily energy requirements
while meeting guidelines for a heart-healthy, diabetes
diet (for all participants) may result in weight loss or no
change in weight among individuals with T2DM.
Society incurs high costs from uncontrolled chron-
ic disease such as T2DM [51], particularly among
low-income, food-insecure, and/or underinsured pop-
ulations who are more likely to delay care, use the
emergency room, and require hospital inpatient ser-
vices [52]. Identifying less resource-intensive ways
to help individuals manage their illnesses in the
context of competing subsistence needs is therefore
critical for the optimal use of public funds. A retro-
spective study conducted by the Metropolitan Area
Neighborhood Nutrition Alliance (MANNA) com-
pared chronically ill clients receiving three meals a
day for 6 months with a similar group of Medicaid
patients. They found that monthly healthcare costs
were 28% lower and average inpatient costs were
30% lower among MANNA clients receiving the
meal intervention compared to Medicaid patients
not receiving meals [47]. In our study, food and
packaging costs for the Food = Medicine intervention
were $6.58 a day per participant ($1184 for 6 month
intervention) in contrast to $2774, the cost per inpa-
tient day in a California hospital [53]. While these
preliminary studies are promising, formal, rigorously
designed cost-effectiveness studies are needed to as-
sess the economic value of medically appropriate
food assistance for chronically ill populations.
As with any pre-post study without a comparison
group, observed improvements in our study may be
due to external factors or represent preexisting trends,
rather than represent a change due to the intervention.
Nevertheless, we believe it is plausible that improve-
ments are attributable at least in part to the intervention.
The external environment for low-income individuals in
the San Francisco Bay Area during the time of our study
was one of economic crisis characterized by an

 overwhelmingly high cost of living and severe housing
shortage, compromising access to basic needs [54].
Thus, it is unlikely that the external environment
was fully responsible for the observed improve-
ments in health and well-being during the study.
In addition, plausibility is enhanced by our obser-
vation of improvements related to each of the
mechanisms (nutritional, mental health, and behav-
ioral) linking food security to health posited by
our conceptual framework. To obtain more conclu-
sive data, however, it is critical to formally test the
impact of comprehensive, medically appropriate
food assistance using a rigorous, randomized con-
trolled design.
In addition to the pre-post design, our study has addi-
tional limitations. Most HIV participants in our study were
long-standing clients of POH while most T2DM partici-
pants were new clients. Thus, the transition from no ser-
vices directly to a comprehensive nutrition intervention for
participants with T2DM is likely to explain the greater
improvements in several outcomes in this group. In addi-
tion, POH selected intervention participants with relatively
high adherence to POH regular services to maximize likely
exposure to the intervention. This selection process applied
primarily to clients with HIV who had a longer history at
POH to assess adherence. This group may have had greater
housing stability, lower life chaos, less mental illness, and
less drug addiction than less adherent clients. This may
have either biased our results toward the null if excluded
individuals had greater need for the intervention or away
from the null because intervention adherence was high.
Social desirability could have affected participants’ re-
sponses. Due to the small size of our study, we were
underpowered to detect changes in a number of study
outcomes, including diabetes control (HbA1c and fasting
glucose), and hospitalizations. Furthermore, we did not
collect laboratory measures of CD4 cell count or HIV viral
load, and therefore could not directly assess the change in
HIV clinical outcomes. Finally, our use of a brief diet
quality instrument did not allow us to collect detailed
information on diet composition or measure precise dietary
intakes.
Our study provides initial support to the proposition
that “Food is Medicine” may be an effective, low-cost
strategy to improve health in vulnerable populations. By
preventing worsened illness and acute illness episodes,
medically appropriate food support may reduce societal
healthcare costs [47] as well as prevent further impov-
erishment of critically ill individuals. The ultimate goal
is to move toward greater health equity by disrupting the
