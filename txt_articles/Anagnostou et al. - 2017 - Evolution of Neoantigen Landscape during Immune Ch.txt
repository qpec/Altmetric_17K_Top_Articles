ABSTRACT 
 
Immune checkpoint inhibitors have shown significant therapeutic responses 
against tumors containing increased mutation-associated neoantigen load. We 
have examined the evolving landscape of tumor neoantigens during the emergence of acquired resist-
ance in patients with non–small cell lung cancer after initial response to immune checkpoint blockade 
with anti–PD-1 or anti–PD-1/anti–CTLA-4 antibodies. Analyses of matched pretreatment and resist-
ant tumors identifi
 ed genomic changes resulting in loss of 7 to 18 putative mutation-associated neo-
antigens in resistant clones. Peptides generated from the eliminated neoantigens elicited clonal T-cell 
expansion in autologous T-cell cultures, suggesting that they generated functional immune responses. 
Neoantigen loss occurred through elimination of tumor 
 subclones or through deletion of chromosomal 
regions containing truncal alterations, and was associated with changes in T-cell receptor clonality. 
These analyses provide insight into the dynamics of mutational landscapes during immune check-
point blockade and have implications for the development of immune therapies that target tumor 
neoantigens. 
 
SIGNIFICANCE: Acquired resistance to immune checkpoint therapy is being recognized more com-
monly. This work demonstrates for the fi
 rst time that acquired resistance to immune checkpoint 
blockade can arise in association with the evolving landscape of mutations, some of which encode 
tumor neoantigens recognizable by T cells. These observations imply that widening the breadth of 
neoantigen reactivity may mitigate the development of acquired resistance.

 Dynamics of Neoantigen Landscape during Immunotherapy
RESEARCH BRIEF

INTRODUCTION 
 
Tumor cells contain nonsynonymous somatic mutations 
that alter the amino acid sequences of the proteins encoded 
by the affected genes ( 
1 
). Those alterations are foreign to 
the immune system and may therefore represent tumor-
specifi
 c neoantigens capable of inducing antitumor immune 
responses ( 
2, 3 
). Somatic mutational and neoantigen density 
has recently been shown to correlate with long-term benefi
 t 
from immune checkpoint blockade in non–small cell lung 
cancer (NSCLC; ref.  
4 
) and melanoma ( 
5, 6 
), suggesting 
that a high density of neoepitopes stemming from somatic 
mutations may enhance clinical benefi
 t from blockade of 
immune checkpoints that unleash endogenous responses to 
these mutation-associated neoantigens (MANA). Expression 
of  PD-L1 in tumors or tumor-infi
 ltrating immune cells has 
been associated with responses to PD-1 blockade ( 
7–9 
); how-
ever, PD-L1 expression or other immune biomarkers have 
not been suffi
 cient to fully explain therapeutic outcomes 
( 
10 
). 
 
Among the patients who initially respond to PD-1 block-
ade, some become resistant to the therapy ( 
11 
). Upregula-
tion of alternate immune checkpoints ( 
12 
), loss of  
HLA 
 
haplotypes ( 
13 
), or somatic mutations in  
HLA 
 or  
JAK1/
JAK2 
 genes ( 
14, 15 
) have been proposed as mechanisms of 
evasion to immune recognition in some patients, but the 
mechanisms underlying response and acquired resistance 
to immune checkpoint blockade have remained elusive. 
To examine mechanisms of resistance to immunotherapy, 
we performed genome-wide sequence analysis of protein 
coding genes and T-cell receptor (TCR) clonotype analysis, 
followed by functional assays of autologous T-cell activation 
of patients that demonstrated initial response to immune 
checkpoint blockade but ultimately developed progressive 
disease. These analyses identifi
 ed immunogenic MANAs 
that were lost in the resistant tumors through either tumor 
cell elimination or chromosomal deletions, suggesting novel 
mechanisms for acquisition of resistance to immune check-
point blockade. 
 
 
RESULTS 
 
Of a cohort of 42 patients with NSCLC treated with single-
agent PD-1 or combined PD-1 and CTLA-4 blockade, we 
identifi
 ed all consecutive cases ( 
n 
 = 4) that developed acquired 
resistance and where paired tumor specimens were available 
both before and after therapy (Supplementary Figs. S1–S4). 
To examine the landscape of genomic alterations and associ-
ated neoantigens, we performed whole-exome sequencing of 
tumors from these patients ( 
Fig. 1 
; Supplementary Tables S1 
and S2). Pretreatment and postprogression specimens were

Overview of next-generation sequencing, neoantigen prediction, and functional T-cell analyses. Whole-exome sequencing was performed on 
the pretreatment and postprogression tumor and matched normal samples. Exome data were applied in a neoantigen prediction pipeline that evalu-
ates antigen processing, MHC binding, and gene expression to generate neoantigens specifi
 c to the patient’s HLA haplotype. Truncal neoantigens were 
identifi
 ed by correcting for tumor purity and ploidy, and the TCR repertoire was evaluated at baseline, at the time of response, and upon emergence of 
resistance. Putative eliminated neoantigens at the time of resistance were used to generate peptides and stimulate autologous T cells, followed by TCR

obtained from the same anatomic location (CGLU117) or 
from sites in close anatomic proximity (CGLU116, CGLU127, 
and CGLU161; Supplementary Figs. S1–S3). Clinical and 
pathologic characteristics for all patients are summarized in 
Supplementary Table S1 and described in detail in Methods. 
 
 
We used a high-sensitivity mutation detection pipeline ( 
16 
) 
to identify 129, 302, 344, and 127 somatic sequence altera-
tions in preimmunotherapy tumor samples from patients 
CGLU116, CGLU117, CGLU127, and CGLU161, respectively. 
The number and type of alterations as well as specifi
 c driver 
genes identifi
 ed, including  
TP53, KRAS, MYC, ARID1A, RB1, 
 
and  
SMARCA4 
 genes, were consistent with previous observa-
tions of sequence and copy-number changes in NSCLC (refs. 
 
17, 18 
; Supplementary Tables S3 and S4). Postprogression 
tumor samples revealed a change in the overall somatic 
sequence alterations, including both gains and losses result-
ing in 177, 323, 354, and 142 somatic sequence alterations for 
CGLU116, CGLU117, CGLU127, and CGLU161, respectively 
(Supplementary Tables S3 and S4). 
 
We examined multiple immune-related parameters of pep-
tides stemming from somatic alterations using a compu-
tational multidimensional neoantigen prediction platform 
(see Methods). This approach allowed for identifi
 cation of 
peptides within mutated genes that were predicted to be pro-
cessed and presented by MHC class I proteins and therefore 
had the potential to elicit an immune response. The algo-
rithm evaluated the binding of mutant peptides (8–11 mers) to 
patient-specifi
 c MHC class I alleles and ranked the neoanti-
gens according to MHC binding affi
 nity, antigen processing, 
and self-similarity. We also evaluated the average expression 
of altered genes in The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) lung 
cancer specimens, as tumor material was limited and did not 
allow for both genomic and expression analyses. We identi-
fi
 ed 106, 240, 316, and 102 candidate mutation-associated 
neoantigens (cMANA) for pretreatment tumors for CGLU116, 
CGLU117, CGLU127, and CGLU161, respectively. At the 
time of resistance to immune checkpoint blockade, we identi-
fi
 ed 144, 250, 326, and 119 cMANAs from tumors of patients 
CGLU116, CGLU117, CGLU127, and CGLU161 (Supple-
mentary Table S5). 
 
Because higher mutational load in resistant tumors was 
not consistent with the notion that a high mutation burden 
confers response to immune checkpoint blockade, we investi-
gated whether the gained genomic alterations were enriched 
for mutations that are not associated with neoantigens. Inter-
estingly, a higher fraction of mutations not encoding for 
neoantigens was identifi
 ed among gained compared with 
eliminated mutations (19% vs. 8%); however, the small num-
ber of observations did not allow for statistical signifi
 cance. 
This observation may suggest that the gained mutations were 
less likely to be related to an antitumor immune response. 
We also evaluated the gained alterations observed in the 
tumor samples to see if they may provide insight into known 
potential mechanisms of immunotherapy resistance ( 
12–15, 
19 
). However, there were no new alterations or copy-number 
changes in post-therapy samples in the  
CD274 gene encod-
ing for PD-L1,  
PDCD1 
 encoding for PD-1,  
CTLA-4 
, or  
JAK1 
 
or  
JAK2 genes. Similarly, we did not identify any genomic 
alterations in  
HLA 
 genes, β2 microglobulin, or other antigen 
presentation–associated genes. 
 
We observed that a subset of cMANAs present in the 
original tumors were eliminated in tumors at the time of 
resistance to immune checkpoint blockade ( 
Figs. 2A and B 
and  
3A–I 
, and Supplementary Table S6). This included 18, 
10, 7, and 6 cMANAs that were not present in tumors at the 
time of acquired resistance for patients CGLU116, CGLU117, 
CGLU127, and CGLU161, respectively ( 
Fig. 2 
). All eliminated 
cMANAs stemmed from single-base substitutions with the 
exception of neopeptides generated by a frameshift muta-
tion in  
PCSK4 for CGLU116. Among the neoantigens with 
predicted MHC binding affi
 nity <50 nmol/L, the eliminated 
cMANAs had higher predicted MHC binding affi
 nity than 
those that either were retained or gained in the resistant 
tumors (14.5 nmol/L for lost neoantigens vs. 23.4 nmol/L 
or 24.7 nmol/L for retained or gained neoantigens, respec-
tively,  
P 
 < 0.05). The mutations in 23 eliminated cMANAs 
were found in positions thought to be important for TCR 
binding ( 
20 
) and are likely to be important for recognition 
of the mutant peptide, especially when the wild-type peptide 
is also presented ( 
21 
). A quarter of the eliminated cMANAs 
harbored mutations in either anchor or auxiliary anchor 
residues, presumably affecting MHC binding of these neoan-
tigens (Supplementary Table S6 
). 
 
 
 
Although algorithm-based predictions of antigenicity are 
valuable in narrowing down the large number of peptides 
capable of being generated by a mutation to a set of potential 
antigenic peptides presented by self-MHC alleles, functional 
T-cell recognition is critical to evaluate immune responsive-
ness. To this end, we developed a sensitive approach for assess-
ing T-cell response to cMANAs that utilized next-generation 
sequencing of TCR-Vβ CDR3 regions as a measure of T-cell 
clonality. In this approach, TCR-Vβ clonality is compared 
pre-stimulation to post-stimulation  
in vitro 
 
 with cMANA 
peptides. In addition to being more sensitive than the con-
ventional enzyme-linked immunospot assay, this technique 
allowed us to match cMANA-expanded TCR-Vβ CDR3s with 
those found in the patients’
 tumors themselves, identifi
 ed by 
TCR-Vβ CDR3 deep sequencing from the same DNA used for 
mutational analysis. Thus, this approach evaluates MANA-
specifi
 c responses by T cells known to be present within the 
tumor microenvironment. 
 
To evaluate T-cell recognition of eliminated neoantigens, 
purifi
 ed peripheral blood T cells from patients CGLU116, 
CGLU127, and CGLU161 were stimulated with autologous 
peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC) loaded with 
cMANA peptides in a 10-day culture system. We subsequently 
used TCR next-generation sequencing to assess the differen-
tial abundance of neoantigen-specifi
 c T-cell clonotypes in 
these expanded T-cell populations. In order to further inves-
tigate the importance of eliminated cMANAs, we generated 
peptides from retained and gained cMANAs and assessed 
their potential to elicit a MANA-specifi
 c T-cell expansion in 
samples where additional PBMCs were available ( 
Fig. 4A–D 
; 
Supplementary Table S7). 
 
 
For patient CGLU116, all eliminated cMANA peptides 
tested induced a clonal T-cell expansion. Peptides contain-
ing mutations in PGPA1 
903Y>F and SLC26A7 
117R>Q 
 elicited a 
neoantigen-specifi
 c clonal T-cell expansion with no reactiv-
ity observed against the wild-type peptides (

tions in resistant T2 tumors for CGLU116, CGLU117, CGLU127, and CGLU161, respectively (

observed T-cell reactivity specifi
 c to both mutant and wild-

tide had a signifi

 (Supplementary

observed T-cell reactivity specifi
 c to the mutant peptide of 
EP300 
1250C>Y 
 (Supplementary Fig. S6; Supplementary Table 
S8). In contrast, none of the seven retained cMANA peptides 
for CGLU127 and CGLU161 were found to be immunogenic 
by our assay, whereas for case CGLU116, a subset of retained 
cMANA peptides elicited a MANA-specifi
 c clonal T-cell 
expansion (Supplementary Table S9). For gained cMANAs, 
we were able to evaluate only case CGLU116, as this was the 
only one for which additional PBMCs were available. These 
analyses identifi
 ed a small fraction of gained cMANA pep-
tides (30% of peptides tested) that elicited a MANA-specifi
 c 
clonal T-cell expansion in autologous T-cell cultures from 
this patient (Supplementary Table S9). These fi
 ndings indi-
cate that patient-derived T cells recognized the eliminated 
neoantigens and suggest that these neoantigens were relevant 
targets for the achievement of initial therapeutic response to 
checkpoint blockade. 
 
Conceptually, there could be two mechanisms of neo-
antigen loss in resistant tumors. The fi
 rst is through the 
immune elimination of neoantigen-containing tumor cells 
that represent a subset of the tumor cell population, followed 
by subsequent outgrowth of the remaining cells. The second 
is through the acquisition of one or more genetic events 
in a tumor cell that results in neoantigen loss, followed by

Emergence of resistance to immune checkpoint blockade is associated with elimination of mutation-associated neoantigens by LOH and a

selection and expansion of the resistant clone. The fi
 rst mech-
anism would be possible only for subclonal neoantigens, 
whereas the second could serve as a mechanism of resistance 
for both clonal and subclonal alterations. To evaluate the 
contribution of these mechanisms to the loss of neoantigens, 
we analyzed the tumors both before and after therapy using 
the SCHISM pipeline ( 
22 
), and incorporated mutation fre-
quency, tumor purity, and copy-number variation to infer 
the fraction of cells containing a specifi
 c mutation (mutation 
cellularity; see Methods, Supplementary Tables S10–S13). 
Through these approaches, we estimated that alterations 
with a mutation cellularity >0.75 were present in all tumor 
cells (truncal), whereas the remainder were considered to 
be subclonal. Consistent with our predictions, we observed 
both mechanisms of neoantigen elimination: loss of 3 trun-
cal changes and elimination of 38 subclonal cMANAs at the 
time of emergence of resistance (Supplementary Tables S10–
S14). Analysis of genome-wide structural alterations revealed 
that all clonal neoantigens were lost through genetic events 
involving chromosomal deletions and LOH (

functionally validated (Supplementary Table S8). 
 
To evaluate the impact of changes in the neoantigen 
landscape on cytotoxic TCR repertoire, we analyzed seri-
ally collected PBMCs prior to immunotherapy initiation, at 
clinical response, and at resistance for patients CGLU117 
and CGLU127, and at response and disease progression for 
patient CGLU161 (Supplementary Table S15). We hypoth-
esized that loss of neoantigens would lead to a decrease in 
clonality of cytotoxic TCR clonotypes, thus refl
 ecting tumor 
immune evasion at the time of emergence of resistance. For 
patients CGLU127 and CGLU117, we observed peripheral 
T-cell expansion of a subset of the top 100 most frequent 
intratumoral clones, with the most frequent clones reach-
ing a 44- and 25-fold increase in abundance in the blood 
at the time of response, respectively, followed by a decrease 
to pretreatment levels at the time of resistance ( 
Fig. 3C 
 
and Supplementary Fig. S11). For patient CGLU117, this 
observation was consistent with the fact that CD8 
+ 
 immune 
density did not change signifi
 cantly in pretreatment and 
resistant tumors ( 
Fig. 3F and G 
; Supplementary Table S16). 
Importantly, for patient CGLU127, the TCR clonotype spe-
cifi
 c to the functionally validated eliminated neoantigen 
encoding the 603K>T alteration in ANKRD12 was among 
the top 20 circulating TCR clones, demonstrating a similar 
clonal expansion at the time of response and reduction at 
the time of emergence of resistance. Similarly, for patient 
CGLU161, the TCR clone that expanded after stimulation 
with the EP300 
1250C>Y 
 MANA was one of the top three clono-
types observed in peripheral blood at the time of response, 
and its frequency decreased upon emergence of resistance

Neoantigen-specifi
 c TCR expansion in stimulated T-cell cultures. Peptides generated from the eliminated mutation-associated neoantigen 
candidates were synthesized and used to pulse autologous peripheral T cells for patient CGLU116. T cells were stimulated with respective mutant and 
wild-type peptides and cultured for 10 days, followed by next-generation TCR sequencing of expanded T-cell cultures. Reactive TCR clonotypes were 
matched to clones found in infi
 ltrating tumor lymphocytes. Neoantigen-specifi
 c TCR reactivity was observed for the mutant peptides associated with 
mutant HELB 
987P>S (SASPLSVV;  
A 
), SLC26A7 
117R>Q (ISANAVEQIV;  
B 
), and PGAP1 
903Y>F (AFGSAHLFR and VIAFGSAHLFR;  
C 
) compared with their wild-type 
counterparts. An oligoclonal TCR expansion was observed for both mutant (STPSASPLSV) and wild-type (STPSASPLPVV) peptides associated with a 
single-base substitution in  
HELB ( 
D 
). Adjusted  
P values are given for pairwise comparisons between productive frequencies in peptide-stimulated versus 
unstimulated T cells. Solid bars represent mutant peptides, and bars with diagonal pattern denote wild-type peptides.

(Supplementary Fig. S11). For this case, a decrease in abun-
dance was also observed for the predominant peripheral 
TCR clonotypes that were also present in the tumor at the 
time of resistance (Supplementary Fig. S11). As a compari-
son, such decreases in TCR frequencies were not observed 
in a patient with NSCLC with durable response to PD-1 
blockade, and no change in intratumoral TCR frequencies 
was seen in a patient with NSCLC with primary resistance 
to PD-1 blockade (Supplementary Fig. S12). Taken together, 
these observations suggest that TCR expansion may be both 
a useful measure of response to checkpoint blockade and 
an indicator of acquired therapeutic resistance through 
neoantigen loss. 
 
 
DISCUSSION 
 
Despite the compelling and increased durability of clini-
cal effi
 cacy of immune checkpoint inhibitors relative to 
chemotherapy or oncogene-targeted therapy, the majority 
of patients eventually experience therapeutic resistance after 
an initial response to these therapies. Through our compre-
hensive genomic analyses, we have identifi
 ed changes in the 
genomic landscape of tumors during immune checkpoint 
blockade. These analyses show that emergence of acquired 
resistance is associated with loss of mutations encoding for 
putative tumor-specifi
 c neoantigens, through both elimina-
tion of tumor subclones or chromosomal loss of truncal 
alterations. Using a new approach to assess neoantigen reac-
tivity by T cells, we found that some of these eliminated 
mutations encoded peptides recognized by T cells in the 
peripheral circulation of the respective patients. Given that 
the antitumor effi
 cacy of checkpoint blockade likely involves 
release of endogenous T-cell responses to tumor antigens 
generated by coding mutations, our fi
 ndings are consistent 
with a mechanism of acquired resistance to immune check-
point blockade that involves therapy-induced immune edit-
ing of MANAs. 
 
Acquisition of somatic resistance mutations is a common 
mechanism of therapeutic resistance to targeted therapies 
( 
23 
). However, elimination of genomic alterations and more 
specifi
 cally loss of somatic mutations through subsequent 
genetic events is uncommon in the context of natural tumor 
evolution or therapeutic resistance ( 
24–26 
). Elimination of 
mutation-associated antigens by a T cell–dependent immu-
noselection process has been proposed as a mechanism of 
cancer immunoediting in mouse models ( 
27 
) and melanoma 
after adoptive T-cell transfer ( 
28 
), but the evolution of neo-
antigen loss as an escape mechanism under the selective 
pressure of immune checkpoint blockade in lung cancer has 
not been previously studied. We found that in tumor samples 
analyzed at the time of acquired resistance, the majority of 
eliminated mutations were in genes typically expressed at 
high levels in lung cancer and encoded for neoantigens that 
were predicted to either confer high-affi
 nity MHC binding 
or affect TCR contact residues. Eliminated neoantigens elic-
ited a specifi
 c T-cell expansion, and it is conceivable that the 
identifi
 ed neoantigens eliminated at the time of emergence of 
resistance were immunodominant ( 
29 
). In the setting of viral 
infections, it is common that the immune system focuses 
on a limited number of dominant viral epitopes, and loss of 
these epitopes is a common mechanism of viral persistence 
and immune evasion. The determination of the overall role of 
loss of dominant tumor MANAs in acquired resistance to 
immunotherapy with checkpoint blockade will require exten-
sive evaluation of MANA-specifi
 c immune responses in larger 
numbers of patients at varying times during response and 
relapse. 
 
For these patients, we examined a variety of other mech-
anisms that have been proposed in the development of 
resistance to immunotherapies ( 
30 
). We did not observe 
any differences in PD-L1 expression in tumor cells between 
responsive and resistant tumor samples, although our inter-
pretation was limited by the scant material available for 
immunohistochemistry (Supplementary Fig. S13; Supple-
mentary Table S16; refs.  
9, 10 
). Likewise, we did not observe 
any loss-of-function mutations or LOH in genes related to 
other reported mechanisms of resistance, including  
HLA 
 
genes ( 
13 
), β2-microglobulin ( 
15 
),  
PTEN 
 ( 
19 
),  
JAK1 
, and 
 
JAK2 
 ( 
15 
), or the transporter for antigen presentation ( 
TAP1 
) 
gene in the resistance tumor specimens. Although we were 
precluded from evaluating other immune modulators due 
to limited biopsy specimens, it is conceivable that transcrip-
tomic signatures ( 
31 
) or specifi
 c coinhibitory factors, such 
as LAG3 or T-cell immunoglobulin mucin-3 (TIM3; ref.  
12 
), 
may play a role in immune checkpoint regulation. 
 
Our study has several limitations, including its small sam-
ple size and analysis of samples from a defi
 ned period of rela-
tively early acquired therapeutic resistance. Although many 
patients have longer clinical courses after initial response to 
checkpoint blockade, a range of duration in clinical benefi
 t 
has been described in clinical trials, including early acquired 
resistance ( 
11 
). In particular, the patients described herein 
represent a group with faster acquired resistance relative to 
the 17-month median duration of response with PD-1 block-
ade in metastatic lung cancer ( 
32 
). To further evaluate this 
issue in a tumor type with a similar genomic background to 
NSCLC ( 
33 
), we performed a neoantigen landscape analysis 
in pretreatment and postprogression samples of a patient 
with head and neck squamous cell carcinoma (HNSCC) 
treated with immune checkpoint blockade. This patient had 
a deeper response (91% reduction in tumor burden) lasting 
12 months followed by emergence of acquired resistance. 
In this case, although our approach was limited by the low 
tumor purity of the pretreatment sample, we found that 
two cMANAs in the pretreatment tumor were eliminated 
in the postprogression tumor. Of these, HSPA12B 
54P>R 
 was 
eliminated by an LOH event involving chromosome 20 (Sup-
plementary Fig. S14). These fi
 ndings provide evidence that 
the mechanism of acquired resistance may be shared among 
patients of different tumor types with responses of variable 
duration. Another potential limitation is the possibility of 
tumor heterogeneity confounding our observations of elimi-
nated neoantigens. However, we observed a high concord-
ance of detected genomic alterations among three different 
samples from the baseline tumor for patient CGLU116 where 
suffi
 cient material was available for this analysis. Ninety-four 
percent of sequence alterations were identifi
 ed in at least 
two of three samples analyzed, demonstrating that at the 
sequence level, the amount of intratumor mutational hetero-
geneity was minimal.

 Dynamics of Neoantigen Landscape during Immunotherapy
RESEARCH BRIEF
 
MARCH  2017�CANCER DISCOVERY | 271 
 
Although larger studies will be required to study the full 
spectrum of therapeutic resistance to immunotherapy, our 
fi
 ndings provide insight into the relatively rapid dynamics 
of neoantigen gains and losses during therapy and reveal a 
potential mechanism of resistance for at least a fraction of 
these patients. One future area of investigation for patients 
with metastatic disease will be a comprehensive analysis of 
the evolving neoantigen landscape among different meta-
static lesions in the same patient under selective pressure of 
immune checkpoint blockade. 
 
Unraveling the genomic mechanisms through which cancer 
adapts to evade antitumor immune responses will be critical 
for the future development of tailored cancer immunotherapy 
strategies. Putative neoantigens identifi
 ed prior to and at the 
time of emergence of resistance might be used to develop 
patient-specifi
 c immunotherapy approaches, including vac-
cines and adoptive T-cell transfer with TCR-engineered T cells. 
Although clonal neoantigens have recently been reported to 
drive antitumor responses to checkpoint inhibitors ( 
34 
), our 
analyses suggest that underlying immune responses target 
both truncal and subclonal neoantigens and that the com-
bination should be considered for the development of per-
sonalized immunotherapies. They also suggest that tumors 
are quite capable of eliminating both truncal and subclonal 
mutations in the acquisition of resistance, highlighting the 
challenges in defi
 ning which mutations should be chosen to 
construct personalized immunotherapies that would provide 
maximal durability of response. 
 
 
METHODS 
 
 
Patient and Sample Characteristics 
 
Our study group consisted of 4 patients with NSCLC treated with 
immune checkpoint blockade at Johns Hopkins Sidney Kimmel 
Cancer Center. Two patients (CGLU117 and CGLU127) were treated 
with single-agent nivolumab between December 2014 and October 
2015, and 2 patients (CGLU116 and CGLU161) were treated with 
nivolumab and ipilimumab between July 2014 and October 2015. We 
performed neoantigen landscape analysis in an additional case of a 
patient with HNSCC treated with combined PD-1 and KIR blockade. 
The studies were conducted in accordance with the Declaration of 
Helsinki and were approved by the Institutional Review Board (IRB), 
and patients provided written informed consent for sample acquisi-
tion for research purposes. Clinical and pathologic characteristics for 
all patients are summarized in Supplementary Table S1, and tumor 
burden kinetics are shown in  
Fig. 3 and in Supplementary Fig. S4. 
 
Patient CGLU116 was a 55-year-old male, 40 pack-year ex-smoker, 
initially diagnosed with stage IIB squamous lung cancer, treated 
with left pneumonectomy followed by adjuvant cisplatin, vinorel-
bine, and bevacizumab. Upon disease recurrence, he was enrolled 
on a clinical trial of concurrent anti–PD-1 and anti–CTLA-4 therapy 
and achieved a partial response as defi
 ned by RECIST 1.1 criteria 
after one dose of combined treatment (Supplementary Fig. S1). Due 
to treatment-related toxicities and sustained response, he did not 
receive further anticancer therapy and developed progressive disease 
with left pleural implants 11 months later. Patient CGLU117 was a 
55-year-old male, 80 pack-year current smoker, diagnosed with stage 
IIIA EGFR/KRAS/ALK wild-type lung adenocarcinoma. Following 
progression in a solitary site (right adrenal metastasis) immediately 
after defi
 nitive chemoradiation with cisplatin and etoposide, and 
continued progression on fi
 rst-line chemotherapy with carboplatin, 
pemetrexed, and bevacizumab, he received anti–PD-1 therapy. He 
achieved stable disease (22% tumor regression by RECIST 1.1) of 
4 months’
 duration before he developed disease progression within 
the enlarging right adrenal metastasis ( 
Fig. 2 
). Patient CGLU127 was 
a 58-year-old female, 40 pack-year ex-smoker diagnosed with stage IV 
KRAS-mutant (13G>C) lung adenocarcinoma, initially treated with 
carboplatin, paclitaxel, and cetuximab, followed by second-line pem-
etrexed. Upon disease progression, she commenced anti–PD-1 ther-
apy and achieved a partial response for 6 months, but subsequently 
relapsed with increased hilar lymphadenopathy (Supplementary 
Fig. S2). CGLU161 was a 42-year-old male, 5 pack-year distant ex-
smoker, with a history of mantle fi
 eld radiation to the chest for 
Hodgkin lymphoma at age 19, diagnosed with stage IV lung adeno-
carcinoma with liver metastasis. His tumor was wild-type for EGFR, 
ALK, and KRAS, and he was enrolled in a fi
 rst-line clinical trial of com-
bined PD-1 and CTLA-4 blockade. He achieved a partial response of 
7 months’
 duration before disease progression at the site of the pri-
mary tumor, followed by brain metastasis and diffuse tumor infi
 ltra-
tion of the liver parenchyma 4 months later (Supplementary Fig. S3). 
Patient CGHN2 was a 54-year-old male, former smoker, diagnosed 
with HPV-negative laryngeal cancer, initially treated with surgical resec-
tion followed by fi
 rst-line cisplatin, docetaxel, and bevacizumab and 
second-line cetuximab. Upon disease progression, he received PD-1 
and KIR blockade, achieving a partial response, prior to develop-
ing acquired resistance 12 months later with abdominal and pelvic 
metastases. Patients underwent tumor biopsies within 30 days prior to 
starting treatment and at the time of progression, with the exception of 
CGLU116 and CGHN2, for which archival specimens from the time of 
the patient’
s pneumonectomy and laryngectomy were analyzed respec-
tively as the baseline tumor sample. All tumor samples were provided as 
formalin-fi
 xed paraffi
 n-embedded (FFPE) blocks. Seven pretreatment 
and seven postprogression specimens and their matched normal tissues 
were obtained and analyzed with IRB approval and patients’
 consent. 
 
For patient CGLU116, we analyzed the lung tumor from the time 
of diagnosis and an enlarging pleural nodule at the time of progres-
sion. To assess tumor heterogeneity of case CGLU116 where adequate 
baseline tumor was available, we analyzed two additional tumor sam-
ples originating from different fragments of the left lower lobe tumor. 
For patient CGLU117, a solitary adrenal metastasis present prior to 
initiation of PD-1 blockade was analyzed and compared with the 
same, postprogression enlarging adrenal mass. For patient CGLU127, 
we studied the lung tumor prior to treatment and a tumor-infi
 ltrated 
hilar lymph node at the time of progression. For patient CGLU161, 
a mediastinal lymph node obtained prior to immunotherapy was 
analyzed and compared with a tumor from the site of the primary 
right upper lobe mass, which regressed with therapy but eventually 
progressed at the time of therapeutic resistance. For patient CGHN2, 
a laryngeal mass was analyzed as the baseline specimen and compared 
with a pelvic metastasis at the time of resistance. 
 
Serial blood samples were collected to assess immune responses: 
for patients CGLU117 and CGLU127, samples were obtained prior 
to treatment initiation, at the time of response to anti–PD-1 therapy 
and at the time of disease progression. For patient CGLU161, blood 
was collected at the time of response to combined PD-1 and CTLA-4 
blockade and at the time of disease progression. Blood samples 
from the time of disease progression were available for patient 
CGLU116. Tumor and serial peripheral blood samples from 2 addi-
tional patients with NSCLC, one with ongoing response (CGLU111) 
and the other with primary resistance (CGLU115) to PD-1 blockade, 
were also analyzed to provide a comparator group for the TCR clo-
notype trends identifi
 ed in the 4 patients with acquired resistance. 
 
 
 
Treatment and Assessment of Clinical Response 
 
CGLU117 and CGLU127 received single-agent nivolumab at 
3 mg/kg every 2 weeks. CGLU116 and CGLU161 received nivolumab 
1 mg/kg every 2 weeks and ipilimumab 1 mg/kg every 6 weeks.

Tumor responses to immune checkpoint blockade were evaluated 
every 8 weeks after treatment initiation. The RECIST version 1.1 
was used to determine clinical responses. Based on RECIST cri-
teria, patients CGLU116, CGLU127, and CGLU161 had a partial 
response as best response, and patient CGLU117 had stable disease 
(22% tumor regression). Patient CGLU116 achieved a deep partial 
response after one dose of nivolumab and ipilimumab, but was not 
able to receive further treatment because of treatment-related toxic-
ity. Computed tomographic fi
 ndings and tumor burden kinetics are 
shown in  
Fig. 3 and Supplementary Figs. S1–S4. Patient CGHN2 
received PD-1 and KIR blockade, achieving a partial response with a 
91% reduction in tumor burden lasting a year. 
 
 
Whole-Exome Sequencing, Neoantigen Prediction, 
and TCR Sequencing 
 
Whole-exome sequencing was performed on the pretreatment and 
postprogression tumor and matched normal samples. Tumor samples 
underwent pathologic review for confi
 rmation of lung cancer diagno-
sis and assessment of tumor purity. Slides from each FFPE block were 
macrodissected to remove contaminating normal tissue. Matched 
normal samples were provided as peripheral blood. DNA was extracted 
from patients’
 tumors and matched peripheral blood using the Qiagen 
DNA FFPE and Qiagen DNA blood mini kit, respectively (Qiagen). 
Fragmented genomic DNA from tumor and normal samples was used 
for Illumina TruSeq library construction (Illumina), and exonic regions 
were captured in solution using the Agilent SureSelect v.4 kit (Agilent) 
according to the manufacturers’
 instructions as previously described 
( 
16, 23, 35 
). Paired-end sequencing, resulting in 100 bases from each 
end of the fragments for the exome libraries, was performed using 
Illumina HiSeq 2000/2500 instrumentation (Illumina). The mean 
depth of coverage for the pretreatment and resistant tumors was 214× 
and 217×, respectively, allowing us to identify sequence alterations and 
copy-number changes in >20,000 genes (Supplementary Table S2). 
 
 
 
Primary Processing of Next-Generation Sequencing Data 
and Identifi
 cation of Putative Somatic Mutations 
 
Somatic mutations were identifi
 ed using the VariantDx custom 
software for identifying mutations in matched tumor and nor-
mal samples ( 
16 
). Prior to mutation calling, primary processing of 
sequence data for both tumor and normal samples was performed 
using Illumina CASAVA software (version 1.8), including masking of 
adapter sequences. Sequence reads were aligned against the human 
reference genome (version hg19) using ELAND with additional rea-
lignment of select regions using the Needleman–Wunsch method 
( 
36 
). Candidate somatic mutations, consisting of point mutations, 
insertions, and deletions as well as copy-number changes were then 
identifi
 ed using VariantDx across the whole exome. VariantDx exam-
ines sequence alignments of tumor samples against a matched nor-
mal while applying fi
 lters to exclude alignment and sequencing 
artifacts. In brief, an alignment fi
 lter was applied to exclude quality-
failed reads, unpaired reads, and poorly mapped reads in the tumor. 
A base quality fi
 lter was applied to limit inclusion of bases with 
reported Phred quality score >30 for the tumor and >20 for the 
normal. A mutation in the pre- or posttreatment tumor samples was 
identifi
 ed as a candidate somatic mutation only when (1) distinct 
paired reads contained the mutation in the tumor; (2) the fraction of 
distinct paired reads containing a particular mutation in the tumor 
was at least 10% of the total distinct read pairs; (3) the mismatched 
base was not present in >1% of the reads in the matched normal 
sample as well as not present in a custom database of common ger-
mline variants derived from the Single Nucleotide Polymorphism 
database (dbSNP), and (4) the position was covered in both the 
tumor and normal. Mutations arising from misplaced genome align-
ments, including paralogous sequences, were identifi
 ed and excluded 
by searching the reference genome. To validate our mutation 
detection approach, we investigated whether the gained and lost 
genomic alterations derived from single-base substitutions were also 
detected by the MuTect method ( 
37 
). We found that 98% of the 
eliminated and 99% of the gained genomic alterations identifi
 ed by 
our pipeline were also detected by MuTect, providing independent 
confi
 rmation of our methodology. To ensure that the mutations 
that were absent in individual tumor specimens were not simply due 
to low coverage, we required that each mutated base be sequenced 
at a level that was at least 20% of the average sequence coverage of that 
sample. Alterations in cases where both tumor samples had tumor 
purity <50% (CGLU116) were analyzed with the above criteria except 
that the minimum fraction of distinct reads was 5%, as adjusting 
the mutant allele fraction cut-off from 10% to 5% allowed for high-
sensitivity mutation detection in the 30% to 50% tumor purity range. 
To address the possibility of tumor heterogeneity in case CGLU161, 
where the pretreatment tumor sample was obtained from a lymph 
node metastasis and not the primary tumor, we analyzed available 
additional lesions from the liver and brain after initiation of therapy 
and considered only the high concordance mutations that were pre-
sent at the baseline biopsy and either one of the additional lesions. 
 
Candidate somatic mutations were further fi
 ltered based on gene 
annotation to identify those occurring in protein coding regions. 
Functional consequences were predicted using snpEff and a custom 
database of CCDS, RefSeq, and Ensembl annotations using the 
latest transcript versions available on hg19 from UCSC (https://
genome.ucsc.edu/). Predictions were ordered to prefer transcripts with 
canonical start and stop codons and CCDS or RefSeq transcripts over 
Ensembl when available. Finally, mutations were fi
 ltered to exclude 
intronic and silent changes, while retaining mutations resulting in 
missense mutations, nonsense mutations, frameshifts, or splice-site 
alterations. A manual visual inspection step was used to further 
remove artifactual changes. An analysis of each candidate mutated 
region either gained or lost in postprogression specimens was per-
formed using the BLAST like alignment tool (BLAT) to remove 
repeated regions in the genome as these may confound mutation 
analyses (http://genome.ucsc.edu/cgi-bin/hgBlat). For each mutation, 
101 bases, including 50 bases 5′ and 3′ fl
 anking the mutated base, 
were used as query sequence. Candidate mutations were removed 
from further analysis, if the analyzed region resulted in >1 BLAT hits 
with 90% identity over 90 SPAN sequence length. 
 
Given the high polymorphism of the  
HLA 
 loci which can prevent 
appropriate alignment of sequencing reads to the reference genome, 
we performed a separate bioinformatic analysis using POLYSOLVER 
to independently detect somatic Class I  
HLA 
 mutations ( 
14 
). These 
analyses confi
 rmed that there were no somatic  
HLA 
 mutations as origi-
nally determined by our whole-exome sequencing analysis pipeline. 
 
 
Neoantigen Predictions 
 
To assess the immunogenicity of somatic mutations, exome data 
combined with each individual patient’
s MHC class I haplotype 
were applied in a neoantigen prediction platform that evaluates 
binding of somatic peptides to class I MHC, antigen processing, 
self-similarity, and gene expression. Detected somatic mutations, 
consisting of nonsynonymous single-base substitutions, insertions, 
and deletions, were evaluated for putative neoantigens using the 
Immuno 
Select 
-R pipeline (Personal Genome Diagnostics). For sin-
gle-base substitutions, Immuno 
Select

procedure to generate a fi
 nal genotype ( 
38 
). The  
HLA 
 genotype 
served as input to netMHCpan to predict the MHC class I binding 
potential of each somatic and wild-type peptide (IC 
50 
 nmol/L), with 
each peptide classifi
 ed as a strong binder (SB), weak binder, or non-
binder (NB; refs.  
39–41 
). Peptides were further evaluated for antigen 
processing by netCTLpan ( 
42 
) and were classifi
 ed as cytotoxic T 
lymphocyte epitopes (E) or nonepitopes (NA). Paired somatic and 
wild-type peptides were assessed for self-similarity based on MHC 
class I binding affi
 nity ( 
43 
). Neoantigen candidates meeting an IC 
50 
 
affi
 nity <5,000 nmol/L were subsequently ranked based on MHC 
binding and T-cell epitope classifi
 cations. Tumor-associated expres-
sion levels derived from TCGA were used to generate a fi
 nal ranking 
of candidate immunogenic peptides. Anchor and auxiliary anchor 
residues for mutant peptides–HLA class I allele pairs were evaluated 
by the SYFPEITHI online tool ( 
44 
). To generate Supplementary Table 
S6, we fi
 ltered the neoantigen predictions by applying a 500 nmol/L 
MHC affi
 nity threshold and reduced the redundancy by selecting the 
strongest binding neoepitope specifi
 c to an HLA allele with known 
binding motifs in SYFPEITHI. 
 
 
Somatic Copy-Number Analysis 
 
The genome-wide copy-number profi
 le of each tumor sample 
was derived by comparing the abundance of aligned reads to each 
region between tumor and matched normal samples using the 
CNVkit method ( 
45 
). CNVkit enables inference and visualization 
of copy-number aberrations from sequencing data. The method 
uses sequencing reads mapped to the exome, as well as nonspecifi
 -
cally captured reads, and corrects the sequencing depth profi
 le with 
respect to three sources of bias: GC content, capture target size, and 
regions containing sequence repeats. We derived a preliminary esti-
mate of genome-wide copy-number profi
 le of each tumor sample as 
quantifi
 ed by log 
2 
 ratio of reads between tumor and matched normal. 
Next, we estimated the tumor purity by cross-analysis of these log 
2 
 
ratio values and minor allele frequency of germline heterozygous 
variants. The estimated tumor purity ( 
 
p 
 
) was used to convert the 
observed raw log 
2 
 ratio ( 
 
r 
 
) to tumor copy number ( 
 
CN 
T  
 
), correcting 
for contribution of normal cell copy number (

The corresponding tumor copy-number values were rounded to the

Tumor Purity Estimation 
 
Normal cell contamination is one of the factors complicating the 
analysis of somatic alterations in solid tumors ( 
46 
). To estimate the 
purity of each tumor sample, we extended the framework of SCHISM 
1.1.1 ( 
22 
) to cross-analyze the preliminary somatic copy-number 
profi
 le, and the minor allele frequency distribution of germline 
heterozygous SNPs along the genome. In each tumor sample, we 
selected a candidate subset of chromosomes or chromosome arms 
where there was a clear deviation of the minor allele frequencies from 
the expected value of 0.5, and log 
2 
 ratio of read counts indicated 
one copy loss by visual inspection (Supplementary Table S17). The 
expected minor allele frequency of germline heterozygous SNPs was 
calculated as

N are the number of copies of minor

) and 
present in one copy in normal cells ( 
nm
N = 1 
), tumor copy number is 
one (

We identifi
 ed the mode of minor allele frequency in each such region 
and estimated the tumor purity as the average purity values estimated 
for the analyzed regions. To validate the accuracy of our method to 
estimate tumor purity, we compared tumor purity estimates derived 
by SCHISM to four methods of estimating purity: (1) pathology 
review, (2) mutation allele frequency, (3) PyLOH ( 
47 
), and (4) Sequenza 
(ref.  
48 
; Supplementary Table S18). Comparison of tumor purity 
estimates indicated a relatively high-level correlation ( 
r 
 >= 0.78) with 
statistical signifi
 cance ( 
P 
 < 0.05) across all pairs of methods (Supple-
mentary Fig. S15). On average, results from PyLOH had the largest dif-
ference (as measured by root mean squared error) with those of other 
methods, and the smallest dynamic range. Of the three copy number–
based methods, our method had the smallest root mean squared error 
when compared with the mutation-based approach. 
 
 
 
Genome-Wide Analysis of Allelic Imbalance 
 
In each tumor sample, we examined evidence for allelic imbalance 
in genomic regions surrounding somatic mutations. For each muta-
tion, we compared the minor allele frequency of 20 closest germline 
heterozygous SNPs with coverage of at least 10 reads between tumor 
and matched normal sample using a one-sided  
t test. The  
P 
 values 
were corrected for multiple hypothesis testing using the Benjamini–
Hochberg ( 
49 
) procedure. Regions with FDR less than or equal to 
0.05 and a difference of at least 0.10 between the average minor allele 
frequencies of tumor and normal were marked as harboring allelic 
imbalance. 
 
 
 
Somatic Mutation Cellularity Estimation 
 
Estimating the fraction of cancer cells harboring each somatic 
mutation (mutation cellularity) is central to reconstruction of sub-
clone hierarchies and tumor evolution. We used an extension of 
the framework in SCHISM-1.1.1 ( 
22 
) to derive point estimates and 
confi
 dence intervals of mutation cellularities as follows: For each 
mutation, the expected value of variant allele frequency  
Vexp 
 
 was 
determined by tumor sample purity  
p 
 
, tumor copy number  
 
CNT 
 
, 
normal copy number  
 
CNN 
 
, mutation cellularity  
 
C 
 
, and mutation 
multiplicity  
 
m 
 
. Mutation multiplicity refers to the number of mutant 
alleles present in tumor cells harboring the mutation. The expected 
variant allele frequency was calculated as:

mCp

p CN

For each mutation, we derived a cellularity estimate at each pos-
sible multiplicity value (in the absence of allele-specifi
 c tumor copy 
number,  
 
∈ {1, . . . , CNT 
 
}) as follows. Given a multiplicity value  
 
m 
 
, we 
found the expected variant allele frequency for each value of cellular-
ity in  
Cg  = {0.00, 0.01, . . . , 1.00} 
. Next, we found the binomial likeli-
hood of observing  
 
rB 
 
 variant reads out of  
 
rT 
 
 total reads covering the 
mutation where success probability is set to  
Vexp 
. We normalized these 
likelihood values to sum to one, and derived the maximum likeli-
hood estimate of cellularity and the 95% confi
 dence interval using 
this normalized likelihood distribution over  
Cg 
 
. 
 
We selected the level of multiplicity for each mutation in each sam-
ple as follows: The multiplicity for mutations with tumor copy num-
ber of 1 is 1. Mutations with tumor copy number of 2 and outside 
regions with allelic imbalance are assumed to have multiplicity of 1. 
Mutations with tumor copy number of 2 and in regions with allelic 
imbalance are assumed to have multiplicity of 2. For mutations 
that are lost where allelic imbalance was absent in the pretreatment

sample and was present in the posttreatment sample, multiplicity is 
assumed to be 1. Mutations absent in the pretreatment sample and 
in regions with constant tumor copy number between pre- and post-
treatment samples have multiplicity of 1. Finally, for mutations lost 
where tumor copy number changes from 3 in the pretreatment to 2 
in the posttreatment sample, and allelic imbalance is present only in 
the pretreatment sample, multiplicity is assigned to 1. For mutations 
where multiplicity (and cellularity) could not be determined using 
the above approach, we used a secondary method. This involved clus-
tering above mutations to identify groups of mutations with similar 
cellularity across all available samples. For each unclassifi
 ed muta-
tion, the unresolved cellularity (and multiplicity) values were selected 
to minimize the distance to the closest mutation cluster. A cellularity 
>0.75 was used to differentiate truncal from subclonal mutations. 
 
 
 
Stimulation and Expansion of MANA-Reactive T Cells 
 
Functional assays of peptide-stimulated T-cell expansion were per-
formed for cases CGLU116, CGLU127, and CGLU161. On day 0, 
T cells were isolated from PBMC by negative selection (EasySep; 
STEMCELL Technologies). The T cell–negative fraction was gamma 
irradiated (3,000 rads) and cocultured with an equal number of 
negatively-selected T cells in culture media (AIM V with 50 μg/mL 
gentamicin) with 1 μg/mL relevant peptide (Sigma-Aldrich) and sup-
plemented with IL7 (25 ng/mL; Miltenyi) and IL15 (25 ng/mL; Pepro-
Tech). IL2 (10 IU/mL; Chiron) was added to the cultures on day 1. On 
day 3, half the media was replaced with fresh culture media contain-
ing the same concentrations of IL2, IL7, and IL15 used previously. On 
day 7, half the media was replaced with fresh culture media contain-
ing 20 IU/mL IL2 and 25 ng/mL IL7 and IL15. On day 9, half the 
media was replaced with fresh culture media without cytokines. Cells 
were harvested and washed twice with PBS on day 10. Cultured T-cell 
pellets were fl
 ash-frozen in liquid nitrogen and stored at −140°C. 
 
 
TCR Sequencing 
 
TCR clones were evaluated in pretreatment and postprogression 
tumor tissue, matching peripheral blood lymphocytes (PBL), and 
cMANA peptide–stimulated autologous T-cell cultures by next-
generation sequencing. DNA from pre- and posttreatment tumor 
samples and PBLs was isolated by using the Qiagen DNA FFPE and 
Qiagen DNA blood mini kit, respectively (Qiagen). For CGLU111 
and CGLU115, pretreatment tumor samples and serial PBLs were 
analyzed. TCR-β CDR3 regions were amplifi
 ed using the survey 
(tumor) or deep (PBLs) ImmunoSeq assay in a multiplex PCR method 
using 45 forward primers specifi
 c to TCR Vβ gene segments and 
13 reverse primers specifi
 c to TCR Jβ gene segments (Adaptive Bio-
technologies; refs.  
50, 51 
). Productive TCR sequences were further 
analyzed. Given the low numbers of total productive rearrangements 
in the tumor samples, we used the TCR sequencing data from TILs 
to identify intratumoral clones that were present in peripheral and 
peptide-stimulated T-cell samples but have refrained from drawing 
any conclusions directly from comparing TIL samples. The top 100 
most frequent TCR clones in the tumor were used to determine 
their frequencies in peripheral blood prior to treatment, at the time 
of response and upon emergence of resistance. For each sample, a 
clonality metric was estimated in order to quantitate the extent of 
monoclonal or oligoclonal expansion by measuring the shape of the 
clone frequency distribution (19). Clonality values ranged from 0 to 
1, where values approaching 1 indicated a nearly monoclonal popula-
tion (Supplementary Table S15). 
 
 
 
Immunohistochemistry and Interpretation of PD-L1 
and CD8 Staining 
 
Immunohistochemistry for PD-L1 was performed using the PD-L1 
IHC 22C3 pharmDx assay kit (Dako). In brief, slides were depar-
affi
 nized with xylene and rehydrated with ethanol. Antigen retrieval 
was performed using citrate buffer (pH = 6) at a temperature of 
97°C for 20 minutes. After blocking of endogenous peroxidase, slides 
were incubated with the primary mouse anti-human PD-L1 antibody 
(clone 22C3) or the negative control reagent for 30 minutes at room 
temperature. Slides were then incubated with an anti-mouse Linker 
antibody, followed by a 30-minute incubation with the FLEX 
+ sec-
ondary antibody/horseradish peroxidase polymer system. Signal was 
visualized with 3,3′ diaminobenzidine (DAB), and slides were coun-
terstained with hematoxylin and coverslipped. NCI-226, a lung cancer 
cell line with known PD-L1 protein expression, and MCF-7, a breast 
cancer cell line with negative PD-L1 protein expression, were used as 
positive and negative controls, respectively. Negative control sections, 
in which the primary antibody was omitted, were also used for each 
immunostaining run. A minimum of 100 tumor cells were evaluated 
per specimen; only membranous staining was considered specifi
 c and 
further interpreted. PD-L1 protein expression was evaluated based 
on the intensity of staining on a 0 to 3+ scale, and the percentage 
of immune-reactive tumor cells. Samples with membranous PD-L1 
staining with an intensity score of 2+ in at least 1% of cells were clas-
sifi
 ed as PD-L1 positive. Similarly, slides were deparaffi
 nized, rehy-
drated, antigen retrieved, and incubated with a mouse anti-human 
CD8 antibody (Dako) diluted 1:100 overnight at 4°C, followed by 
a 30-minute incubation with the FLEX 
+ 
 polymer system. DAB was 
used for signal visualization, and sections were subsequently counter-
stained with hematoxylin and coverslipped. CD8-positive lymphocyte 
density was evaluated per 20× high power fi
 eld (Supplementary Table 
S16). CD8 expression was evaluated in pretreatment and postprogres-
sion tissue specimens for CLGU117 ( 
Fig. 3 
) and in postprogression 
specimens for CGLU116 and CGLU161 (Supplementary Fig. S16) 
given limited tissue availability for the remaining cases. 
 
 
Statistical Analyses 
 
Somatic mutations found to harbor at least one candidate neoan-
tigen were utilized to compare features of immunogenicity between 
those eliminated and those shared or gained after treatment across the 
4 patients. Given a specifi
 c binding threshold (IC 
50 
), mutations 
that generated neoantigens were characterized for features includ-
ing minimum predicted IC 
50 
, average predicted affi
 nity, the num-
ber of SB classifi
 cations, and corresponding gene expression. To 
reduce redundancy, somatic mutations with multiple peptides 
satisfying the IC 
50 
 threshold were represented by their average 
value for downstream statistical comparisons of lost and shared/
gained groups. The Student  
t test was applied to compare mean 
predicted MHC affi
 nities between lost and gained, and lost and 
retained cMANAs using both a 50 nmol/L and 500 nmol/L thresh-
old. Only signifi
 cant differences are indicated in the results. For 
the differential expansion TCR analysis, productive frequencies in 
the peptide-stimulated T cells were compared with unstimulated 
T cells (“no peptide” condition) by the Fisher exact test. TCR clones 
above 0.025% were considered expanded when they were found to 
be signifi
 cantly expanded in a single cMANA-stimulated condition 
and not expanded in any other peptide-stimulated conditions. The 
 
P 
 values were corrected for multiple hypothesis testing using the 
Benjamini–Hochberg ( 
49 
) procedure. Statistical analysis was per-
formed in R version 3.2.2.
