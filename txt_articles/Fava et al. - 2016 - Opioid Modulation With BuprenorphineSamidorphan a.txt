Objective: Major depressive disorder has been associated
with dysregulation of the endogenous opioid system. The
authors sought to determine whether opioid modulation
achieved through administration of ALKS 5461, a combina-
tion of a m- and k-opioid partial agonist, buprenorphine, and
a m-opioid antagonist, samidorphan, would exhibit antide-
pressant activity in patients with major depression.
Method: A multicenter, randomized, double-blind, placebo-
controlled, two-stage sequential parallel comparison design
study was conducted in adults with major depression who had
aninadequateresponsetooneortwocoursesofantidepressant
treatment. Participants were randomly assigned to receive
adjunctive treatment with 2 mg/2 mg of buprenorphine/
samidorphan (the 2/2 dosage group), 8 mg/8 mg of
buprenorphine/samidorphan (the 8/8 dosage group), or
placebo. Antidepressant effect was measured based on
change from baseline to the end of 4 weeks of treatment on
the 17-item Hamilton Depression Rating Scale (HAM-D), the
Montgomery-Åsberg Depression Rating Scale (MADRS), and
the Clinical Global Impressions severity scale (CGI-S).
Results: Compared with the placebo group, there were sig-
nificantlygreaterimprovementsinthe2/2dosagegroupacross
the three depression outcome measures (HAM-D: 22.8, 95%
CI=25.1,20.6;MADRS:24.9,95%CI=28.2,21.6;CGI-S:20.5,
95% CI=20.9, 20.1). There was also evidence of improvement
in the 8/8 dosage group, although it did not achieve statistical
significance. Overall, the buprenorphine/samidorphan com-
binations were well tolerated, and there was no evidence of
opioid withdrawal on treatment discontinuation.
Conclusions: The buprenorphine/samidorphan combina-
tion is a novel and promising candidate for treatment of major
depressive disorder in patients who have an inadequate re-
sponse to standard antidepressants.

An estimated 60%–70% of patients with major depressive
disorder have an inadequate response to initial treatment
(1–3), resulting in substantial persistent impairment and high
utilization of health care resources (4). While therapeutic
strategies such as switching antidepressants and using ad-
juvant drug treatments can improve response, almost 40% of
patients remain symptomatic and fail to achieve full re-
mission (5, 6). There is an urgent public health need for al-
ternative antidepressant treatments.
Opioids have been used for centuries to treat what are now
recognized as mood disorders and were recommended for
melancholia in the 19th and early 20th centuries until they
were displaced in the 1950s by monoamine-based antide-
pressants (7, 8). Since that time, the monoamine hypotheses
for the pathophysiology of depression notwithstanding, a
growing body of preclinical and clinical evidence supporting
the hypothesis that mood disorders involve dysregulation of
the endogenous m- and k-opioid system has emerged (7, 9, 10).
Imaging studies have revealed alterations in opioid transmission
associated with induced sadness, social rejection, and depression
in key brain emotional regulatory centers, including the nucleus
accumbens, ventral pallidum, amygdala, anterior cingulate
cortex, and posterior thalamus (11–13). Furthermore, there is
evidence of endorphin deficiency in severely depressed and
suicidal patients (12, 14, 15). Additionally, uncontrolled clinical
studies have described the efficacy of low-dosage treatment with
opioids, including buprenorphine, for treatment-refractory de-
pression (8, 16), whereas treatment with a m-opioid antagonist

 had no effect (17). Interestingly, there is epidemiologic evidence
that chronic high-dosage opioid agonist therapy may increase
the risk of depression (18).
Despite substantial gains in our understanding of the role of
endogenous opioid dysregulation in the context of depression
and the need for antidepressants with alternative mechanisms
of action, contemporary clinical use of opioid agonists as anti-
depressants in clinical practice remains highly limited because
of unresolved issues of abuse and dependence. To overcome
the limitations of opioid agonists, we developed ALKS 5461—a
combination of buprenorphine, which is a partial m-opioid re-
ceptor agonist (19), and samidorphan (previously referred to as
ALKS 33), which is a potent m-opioid receptor antagonist (20),
formulatedinasinglesublingual tablet.Becauseof highfirst-pass
hepatic metabolism, buprenorphine is generally administered
sublingually. Samidorphan was included in the combination to
block the m agonist effects of buprenorphine associated with its
abuse and addictive potential. Samidorphan has high sublingual
bioavailability and was thus suitable for coformulation with
buprenorphine in a single tablet.
In addition to its effects on m-opioid receptors, bupre-
norphine has also been shown in vivo to block the action of
k-opioid agonists (21) and has been characterized in vitro
to be a partial k agonist with low intrinsic activity (19). The
buprenorphine/samidorphan combination results in high-
affinity binding with net low intrinsic activity at both m- and
k-opioid receptors. It is hypothesized that the combination
serves to decrease or dampen opioid tone in regions of excess
endogenousm-andk-opioidligandactivityandrestoreopioid
tone in regions where such activity is impaired.
Previous studies with the buprenorphine/samidorphan
combination systematically evaluated relative ratios of its
components to block the opioid abuse liability signal (22). A 1:1
ratioofbuprenorphinetosamidorphanwasfoundtomaximally
block subjective and objective measures of m-opioid activity,
including pupillary effects, subjective drug liking, and eupho-
ria. A subsequent small 1-week pilot study characterized the
efficacy signal of an 8 mg/8 mg dosage of buprenorphine/
samidorphan after 1 week of adjunctive treatment in patients
with major depression who had an inadequate response to
standard antidepressants (22). The present study was under-
taken to evaluate the efficacy and tolerability and to prelimi-
narily characterize an active dosage range of a 1:1 ratio of
buprenorphine to samidorphan over 4 weeks as adjunctive
therapy in patients with major depression who had an in-
adequate response to standard antidepressants. The 8 mg/8 mg
dosage was selected to expand the findings from the pilot study
(22), and the 2 mg/2 mg dosage was selected to determine
whether a lower dosage would also yield antidepressant activity.
Clinical trials in depression have been afflicted by in-
creasing rates of placebo response (23). High placebo re-
sponse interferes with assessment of efficacy and masks
treatment effects. In order to address excessive placebo re-
sponse, this trial employed a sequential parallel comparison
design. This design was first proposed for use in depression
clinical studies (24) to enhance signal detection by reducing
placebo response while increasing study efficiency (25, 26).
The sequential parallel comparison design is a two-stage study
design. Stage 1 is a double-blind placebo-controlled parallel
comparison with a higher proportion of patients randomized
to placebo than to active drug. Patients randomized to placebo
who meet criteria for placebo nonresponse in stage 1 are
rerandomized in a blinded fashion to active drug or placebo in
stage 2. The prespecified primary efficacy evaluation of a se-
quential parallel comparison design is based on a weighted
combinationofteststatistics fromall patients instage1 andthe
rerandomized placebo nonresponders in stage 2.
METHOD
The study was conducted at 31 sites in the United States between
December 2011 and March 2013 in accordance with the Dec-
laration of Helsinki (1964) and Good Clinical Practice princi-
ples outlined in the International Conference on Harmonization
(1997). The protocol, amendments, and informed consent were
approved by an institutional review board for each site, and
written informed consent was obtained from all participants.
Study Design
This randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled study uti-
lized a two-stage sequential parallel comparison design. Each
5-week stage consisted of a 4-week treatment period followed
by a 1-week taper. In stage 1, patients were randomized in a 2:2:9
ratio to receive buprenorphine/samidorphan at 2 mg/2 mg
(the 2/2 dosage group) or 8 mg/8 mg (the 8/8 dosage group)
or placebo. This stage 1 randomization ratio was anticipated
to result in an approximate placebo nonresponder yield of
65%, defined as a ,50% reduction in score on the 17-item
Hamilton Depression Rating Scale (HAM-D) (27) in stage 1
and a baseline score .14. This resulted in a number of placebo
nonresponders considered appropriate for 1:1:1 randomization
to the 2/2 dosage, the 8/8 dosage, or placebo in stage 2. The
stage 1 placebo responders continued on placebo in stage 2.
All patients continued on their current antidepressant ther-
apy and on the same dosage throughout the course of the
study (see Table S1 in the data supplement that accompanies
the online editionofthisarticle).Theplaceboorbuprenorphine/
samidorphan study drug was administered daily as sublingual
tablets matched in size and shape. Patients assigned to the 8/8
dosage group were initiated with the 2/2 dose on day 1 and their
dosage was increased to the 8/8 dosage over 3 days.
Trained and certified site-based raters administered both
the HAM-D and the Montgomery-Åsberg Depression Rating
Scale (MADRS) at each study visit. To manage the potential for
site-based rater bias and to verify rating reliability, site-based
HAM-DandMADRSinterviews wererecordedand submitted
for site-independent central scoring. Site-independent and
site-based ratings were compared for quality control.

 DSM-IV-TR Axis I Disorders criteria for a diagnosis of major
depressive disorder, which was validated using a SAFER
interview administered by remote, independent raters (28).
Inclusion criteria were a current episode of major depression
for #24 months; a HAM-D score $16 at screening; treat-
ment with a selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor (SSRI) or a
serotonin-norepinephrine reuptake inhibitor (SNRI) at an
adequate dosage (as defined by the Massachusetts General
Hospital Antidepressant Treatment Response Questionnaire)
for at least 8 weeks; and an inadequate response to one or two
courses of an antidepressant (defined as a ,50% response on
the Antidepressant Treatment Response Questionnaire [29],
which was independently confirmed by remote, independent
raters during the SAFER interview). Participants had to be
otherwise healthy based on physical examination, history,
12-lead ECG, and laboratory tests.
Exclusion criteria were psychotic symptoms during the
current episode; a decrease of .25% or $8 points in HAM-D
score from screening to the baseline visit; initiation of psy-
chotherapy within 6 weeks of screening; use of other ad-
junctive therapy during the current episode; use of opioid
agonists or naltrexone within 2 months before screening;
ECT during the current episode; suicide attempt within the
past 2 years; a history of alcohol or substance dependence
within the past 12 months; any lifetime history of opioid
dependence; or a positive drug test. Women who were
pregnant, planning to become pregnant, or breastfeeding
were excluded.
Study Assessments
Efficacy. The primary outcome measure was the change in
HAM-D score (30) from baseline to the end of the 4-week
treatment period. Secondary outcome measures were the
change from baseline to the end of the 4-week treatment
period in MADRS score (31) and Clinical Global Impressions
severity scale (CGI-S) score (32), rate of response (defined as
a reduction $50% in HAM-D or MADRS score from base-
line to week 4), and rate of remission (defined as a HAM-D
score #7 or a MADRS score #10 at week 4). Exploratory
outcome measures were scores on the Inventory of Depres-
sive Symptomatology–Self-Report (5), the Sheehan Disabil-
ity Scale (33), and the 12-item Short-Form Health Survey,
Version 2 (SF-12) (34). Efficacy was assessed weekly through-
out the course of the study.
Safety and tolerability. Treatment-emergent adverse events,
ECG, vital signs, and laboratory evaluations were monitored
throughout the study. Analysis of treatment-emergent ad-
verse events was conducted across stage 1 and stage 2. Pa-
tients receiving different treatments in stage 1 and stage 2
were included in the analysis of both treatment groups. At-
tribution of a particular treatment-emergent adverse event
was based on the treatment the patient was receiving at the
time of the adverse event’s onset.
Visual analogue scales for drug liking and subjective ef-
fects were used to assess subjective effects; the Clinical
Opiate Withdrawal Scale (35) was used to assess opioid

to assess drug-induced mood effects; and the Columbia–
SuicideSeverityRatingScale(C-SSRS)(37)wasusedtoassess
suicidal behavior and ideation.
Urine drug screens to detect illicit substances were con-
ducted at screening, baseline, and end of study, testing
for amphetamines, barbiturates, benzodiazepines, cocaine,
tetrahydrocannabinol, methadone, opioids, phencyclidine, and,
at screening only, buprenorphine.
Statistical Analysis
The efficacy populations in each stage included all ran-
domized patients who receivedat leastonedose of studydrug
and had at least one postbaseline efficacy assessment. The
safety population included all patients who received at least
one dose of study drug.
The primary efficacy endpoint, HAM-D score change
from baseline to the end of the 4-week treatment period, was
evaluated using the weighted combination of statistics from
the stage-specific mixed models for repeated measures
(MMRM). The models included variables for treatment
group, visit, treatment-by-visit interaction term, and baseline
HAM-D score and specified a first-order autoregressive
covariance matrix. The Kenward-Roger approximation (38)
was used to adjust the denominator degrees of freedom.
The treatment effect was assessed as the differences in
least-squares mean change from baseline to week 4 for the
buprenorphine/samidorphan and placebo groups, combined
across stages 1 and 2 using prespecified 0.6/0.4 weighting
for stage 1/stage 2. Sensitivity analysis was also conducted
using 0.5/0.5 weights. Combined inference was conducted
using the weighted linear combination of stage-wise test
statistics:

Insimulationsequential parallelcomparison designstudies
using MMRM, stage 1/stage 2 weights of 0.6/0.4 resulted in a
robust test statistic that demonstrated type I error control,
optimal power, and minimum bias under the assumption of
missing at random (39). Sensitivity analysis using weights of
0.5/0.5resultedinastudytreatmenteffectslightlygreaterthan
when using the prespecified weights of 0.6/0.4, resulting in
unchanged interpretation and conclusions. The assumption
of missing at random in clinical trials of major depression is
supported bya meta-analysis of 25 New Drug Application data
sets reported by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration. The
same statistical methods were used to evaluate other contin-
uous variables based on change from baseline.
Rates of treatment response and remission were calcu-
lated as the number of patients meeting the response and
remission criteria, respectively, out of the total number of
patients who had a HAM-D or MADRS assessment at week 4.
Exact confidence intervals were calculated.

 In the safety population, discontinuation rates during stage
1 were 10.2% (10/98 patients), 29.2% (7/24), and 31.6% (6/19)
in the placebo, 2/2 dosage, and 8/8 dosage groups,respectively
(Figure 1). In stage 2, discontinuation rates were 5.5% (4/73),
21.7% (5/23), and 18.2% (4/22) in the placebo, 2/2 dosage, and
8/8 dosage groups, respectively.
Efficacy
Table 2 presents baseline and week-4 scores on the de-
pression measures, as well as change from baseline, and
Table 3 presents placebo-adjusted change from baseline. As
shown in Table 3, there were significantly greater im-
provements in the 2/2 dosage group in placebo-adjusted
least-squares mean differences on the HAM-D (22.8, 95%
CI=25.1, 20.6; p=0.014), the MADRS (24.9, 95% CI=28.2,
21.6; p=0.004), and the CGI-S (20.5, 95% CI=20.9, 20.1;
p=0.012) from baseline to the end of the 4-week treatment
period in the overall study. There were smaller, non-
significant changes in the 8/8 dosage group compared with
the placebo group (on the HAM-D, 20.5, 95% CI=22.8, 1.9;
on the MADRS, 22.1, 95% CI=25.6, 1.4; and on the CGI-S,
20.2, 95% CI=20.6, 0.2). The overall effect size (Cohen’s d)
forthe2/2dosagegroupwas0.50fortheHAM-Dand0.54for
the MADRS. Sensitivity analysis using equal weighting for
stages 1 and 2 rather than the 0.6/0.4 weighting resulted in a
slightlylargertreatmenteffect(seeTableS2intheonlinedata
supplement).
In the stage-specific secondary efficacy analyses, a sig-
nificant placebo-adjusted least-squares mean difference
was also observed for the 2/2 dosage group on the HAM-D
(23.7, 95% CI=26.9, 20.6, p=0.02), the MADRS (26.7, 95%
CI=211.3, 22.0, p=0.005), and the CGI-S (20.6, 95%
CI=21.2, 20.1, p=0.03) for stage 2 (Table 3). No significant
differences comparedwithplacebowereobservedfor either
of the buprenorphine/samidorphan treatment groups in
stage 1 or for the 8/8 dosage group in either stage.
Response and Remission Rates
Agreaterproportionofpatientsintheactivegroupsexhibited
a treatment response according to the HAM-D (a reduction
$50% in score from baseline to week 4) compared with
placebo at week 4 in both stages (Figure 2). Rates of response
in stage 1 were 26%, 47%, and 36% for the placebo group, the
2/2 dosage group (p=0.086), and the 8/8 dosage group, re-
spectively. In stage 2, HAM-D response rates were 15%, 33%,
and 28% for the placebo, 2/2 dosage, and 8/8 dosage groups,
respectively.
A greater proportion of participants in the active treat-
ment groups had a treatment response according to the
MADRS (a reduction $50% in score from baseline to week 4)
compared with placebo at week 4 in both stages (Figure 2).
Rates of MADRS response in stage 1 were 26%, 41%, and 43%
for the placebo, 2/2 dosage, and 8/8 dosage groups, re-
spectively. In stage 2, MADRS response rates were 5%, 50%
(p=0.003), and 28% for the placebo, 2/2 dosage, and 8/8
dosage groups, respectively. Rates of HAM-D and MADRS
remission were similar to response rates (see Figure S1 in the
online data supplement).

OPIOID MODULATION WITH BUPRENORPHINE/SAMIDORPHAN AS ADJUNCTIVE TREATMENT IN DEPRESSION
 compared with the placebo group on the Inventory of De-
pressive Symptomatology–Self-Report, the Sheehan Dis-
ability Scale, or the SF-12.
Tolerability
The overall incidence of treatment-emergent adverse events
was 85.8%, and the most common adverse events were
gastrointestinal (52.5%) and neurological symptoms (46.8%).
Common treatment-emergent adverse events occurring with
buprenorphine/samidorphan were nausea, vomiting, dizzi-
ness, and headache (Table 4).
Two patients (1.6%) in the placebo group and 17 (19.3%)
in the buprenorphine/samidorphan groups discontinued
because of treatment-emergent adverse events. The adverse
events in one of the two placebo patients began while the
patient was on placebo and ultimately led to discontinuation
during stage 2 while the patient was taking the 8/8 dosage.
The most common treatment-emergent adverse event
leading to discontinuation was vomiting (4.3%). Similar
proportions of patients in the 2/2 and 8/8 dosage groups had
treatment-emergent adverse events leading to discontinua-
tion. Most discontinuations in the buprenorphine/samidorphan
groups occurred within the first 2 days of dosing. Serious
treatment-emergent adverse events included an attempted
suicide by multiple drug overdose (in the placebo group); in-
traocularmelanoma(inthe2/2dosagegroup);andacuteopioid
withdrawal (in the 2/2 dosage group), which occurred in a
patient taking a prohibited opioid medication.
No evidence of opioid withdrawal was observed in as-
sessments with the Clinical Opiate Withdrawal Scale during
taper or follow-up periods. Generally neutral scores for drug
liking were observed for all treatment groups. For the Ad-
diction Research Center Inventory–Morphine Benzedrine
Group, inconsistent results were observed in stages 1 and 2,
with higher mean scores for the 2/2 dosage group compared
with the other treatment groups in stage 1 but mean scores
similar to those for the placebo group in stage 2 (see Table S3
in the online data supplement). The rate of emergence of

 suicidal ideation on the C-SSRS was low and similar in all
treatment groups. No clinically relevant effects on laboratory
test results, vital signs, or ECG were observed. Scores on item
11 of the HAM-D were consistent with a lack of change in
suicidal ideation.
Urine drug screens to detect illicit substances were con-
ducted at screening, baseline, and end of study. Among the
141 participants who entered the study and received study
drug, one participant tested positive for benzodiazepines at
screening but was negative at the baseline visit. A second
participant tested positive for cocaine at the end of the study
but was negative at the two previous visits. All other par-
ticipants (N=139) were negative for all substances tested.
DISCUSSION
Results of this trial demonstrate clinically meaningful anti-
depressant effects for the buprenorphine/samidorphan
combination compared with placebo in patients with major
depression and an insufficient response to SSRIs or SNRIs.
Theresultsexpandthefindingsofaprevious1-weekpilottrial
in patients with treatment-resistant major depression (22).
Significant differences for the 2/2 dosage group compared
with the placebo group were noted on the HAM-D, the
MADRS, and the CGI-S, and for response and remission on
the MADRS. These results support the premise of the se-
quential parallel comparison design as a strategy to enhance
signal detection in relatively smaller samples, and they are
consistent with the finding that signal detection is enhanced
inplacebo nonresponders,astheeffect sizeofbuprenorphine/
samidorphan was greater in stage 2 than in stage 1 (24, 27).
The overall effect sizes for the 2/2 dosage were 0.50 for
HAM-D and 0.54 for MADRS. The result compares favorably
with results from a meta-analysis of 14 studies with atypical
antipsychoticsasadjunctivetherapyformajordepression,with
reported effect sizes of 0.35 to 0.48 for individual drugs (40).
The most common treatment-emergent adverse events
observed were nausea, vomiting, and dizziness. These ad-
verse events have been previously described with opioidergic
agents. As most treatment-emergent adverse events occurred
within the first 2 days of dosing, tolerability may be improved
in future studies with slower titration of the 2/2 dosage. No
evidence of opioid withdrawal was noted, and no consistent
signal of abuse liability was observed.
Although there was evidence in both dosage groups of
antidepressant activity, greater and statistically significant
treatment effects were observed in the 2/2 dosage group.
Although an inverse or U-shaped dose response is not un-
common for psychiatric medications, the specific reason for
this observed dose response is uncertain. A potential expla-
nation may relate to adverse events. Both the HAM-D and
the MADRS contain questions that may be influenced by
adverse events, including GI symptoms. Thus a higher inci-
dence of vomiting and dizziness in the 8/8 dosage group may
have contributed to the smaller reductions in HAM-D and
MADRS scores. Future studies should explore the efficacy of
buprenorphine/samidorphan dosages lower than 2 mg/2 mg.
Limitations of this study are the small sample size, the
short duration of treatment, and the absence of long-term
follow-up. Further clinical studies will also be needed to ad-
dress definitively whether samidorphan successfully blocks
the addictive potential of buprenorphine when these agents
are administered in the 1:1 ratio. In addition, one might hy-
pothesize that the sequential parallel comparison design results
in attrition because of the longer period of time patients are
receiving placebo. However, in augmentation depression trials,
attrition is relatively modest as patients continue their current
antidepressant treatment, and thus the use of the sequential
parallel comparison design is justified.
Theseresultssupportthehypothesisofasignificantroleof
opioid dysregulation in major depression and the therapeutic
potential of opioid modulation. Further investigation will
be needed to understand the role and relative contribution
of endogenous m- and k-opioid modulation in the observed
antidepressant activity of the buprenorphine/samidorphan
combination. The findings indicate that buprenorphine/
samidorphan may be an important novel candidate for treat-
ment of major depression, and support further confirmatory
large-scale clinical trials.

OPIOID MODULATION WITH BUPRENORPHINE/SAMIDORPHAN AS ADJUNCTIVE TREATMENT IN DEPRESSION
 the first two of three phase 3 efficacy studies from the
comprehensive FORWARD pivotal program for ALKS 5461.
FORWARD-4testedtwodosagelevelsofALKS5461(2mg/2mg
and 0.5 mg/0.5 mg) against placebo by using the sequential
parallel comparison design described in this article. In that
comparison, 385 patients entered the study. There was a
clear trend toward efficacy on the primary endpoint with the
2 mg/2 mg dosage of ALKS 5461, and post hoc analyses
achieved statistical significance for the entire 2 mg/2 mg
dosage group on the MADRS endpoint. On the basis of these
analyses, Alkermes believes that FORWARD-4 provides sup-
portive evidence of the efficacy of ALKS 5461 in the treatment
of major depressive disorder. FORWARD-3 tested ALKS 5461
(2 mg/2 mg) in comparison with placebo by using an alter-
nate design. In that comparison, 429 patients entered the
study. Placebo response was greater than that observed in
FORWARD-4 and no treatment effect of ALKS 5461 was ob-
served. Negative trials due to significant placebo effect
are not uncommon in the study of major depressive disor-
der. FORWARD-5, the third pivotal efficacy study in the
FORWARD program, is ongoing, testing two dosage levels
of ALKS 5461 (2 mg/2 mg and 1 mg/1 mg) and using the
sequential parallel comparison design. On the basis of
information gained from FORWARD-3 and FORWARD-4,
patient enrollment in FORWARD-5 will be increased and
the statistical analysis plan will be updated.
