ASSESSMENT OF GLYCEMIC CONTROL
Patient self-monitoring of blood glucose (SMBG) and A1C are available to health
care providers and patients to assess the effectiveness and safety of a manage-
ment plan on glycemic control. Continuous glucose monitoring (CGM) also has
an important role in assessing the effectiveness and safety of treatment in sub-
groups of patients with type 1 diabetes and in selected patients with type 2 di-
abetes. Data indicate similar A1C and safety with the use of CGM compared with
SMBG (1).
Recommendations
c Most patients using intensive insulin regimens (multiple-dose insulin or in-
sulin pump therapy) should perform self-monitoring of blood glucose (SMBG)
prior to meals and snacks, at bedtime, occasionally postprandially, prior to
exercise, when they suspect low blood glucose, after treating low blood
glucose until they are normoglycemic, and prior to critical tasks such as
driving. B
c When prescribed as part of a broad educational program, SMBG may help to
guide treatment decisions and/or self-management for patients taking less fre-
quent insulin injections B or noninsulin therapies. E
c When prescribing SMBG, ensure that patients receive ongoing instruction and
regular evaluation of SMBG technique, SMBG results, and their ability to use
SMBG data to adjust therapy. E
c When used properly, continuous glucose monitoring (CGM) in conjunction with
intensive insulin regimens is a useful tool to lower A1C in adults with type 1
diabetes who are not meeting glycemic targets. A
c CGM may be a useful tool in those with hypoglycemia unawareness and/or
frequent hypoglycemic episodes. C
c Given the variable adherence to CGM, assess individual readiness for continuing
CGM use prior to prescribing. E

6. GLYCEMIC TARGETS
 c When prescribing CGM, robust di-
abetes education, training, and sup-
port are required for optimal CGM
implementation and ongoing use. E
c People who have been successfully
using CGM should have continued
access after they turn 65 years of
age. E
Self-monitoring of Blood Glucose
Major clinical trials of insulin-treated pa-
tients have included SMBG as part of
multifactorial interventions to demon-
strate the benefit of intensive glycemic
control on diabetes complications. SMBG
is thus an integral component of effective
therapy (2). SMBG allows patients to eval-
uate their individual response to therapy
and assess whether glycemic targets are
being achieved. Integrating SMBG results
into diabetes management can be a
useful tool for guiding medical nutrition
therapy and physical activity, preventing
hypoglycemia, and adjusting medications
(particularlyprandialinsulindoses).Among
patients with type 1 diabetes, there is a
correlation between greater SMBG fre-
quency and lower A1C (3). The patient’s
specific needs and goals should dictate
SMBG frequency and timing.
Optimization
SMBG accuracy is dependent on the instru-
ment and user, so it is important to evalu-
ate each patient’s monitoring technique,
both initially and at regular intervals
thereafter. Optimal use of SMBG requires
proper review and interpretation of the
data, by both the patient and the pro-
vider. Among patients who check their
blood glucose at least once daily, many
report taking no action when results are
high or low. In a yearlong study of insulin-
naive patients with suboptimal initial
glycemic control, a group trained in struc-
tured SMBG (a paper tool was used at
least quarterly to collect and interpret
7-point SMBG profiles taken on 3 consec-
utive days) reduced their A1C by 0.3 per-
centage points more than the control
group (4). Patients should be taught
how to use SMBG data to adjust food in-
take, exercise, or pharmacologic therapy
to achieve specific goals. The ongoing
need for and frequency of SMBG should
be reevaluated at each routine visit to
avoid overuse (5–7). SMBG is especially
important for insulin-treated patients to
monitor for and prevent asymptomatic
hypoglycemia and hyperglycemia. Patients
should be advised against purchasing or
reselling preowned or secondhand test
strips, as these may give incorrect results.
Only unopened vials of glucose test strips
should be used to ensure SMBG accuracy.
For Patients on Intensive Insulin Regimens
Most patients using intensive insulin
regimens (multiple-dose insulin or insulin
pump therapy) should perform SMBG
prior to meals and snacks, at bedtime, oc-
casionallypostprandially,priortoexercise,
when they suspect low blood glucose, af-
ter treating low blood glucose until they
are normoglycemic, and prior to critical
tasks such as driving. For many patients,
this will require testing 6–10 (or more)
times daily, although individual needs
may vary. A database study of almost
27,000 children and adolescents with
type 1 diabetes showed that, after adjust-
ment for multiple confounders, increased
daily frequency of SMBG was significantly
associated with lower A1C (–0.2% per ad-
ditional test per day) and with fewer
acute complications (8).
For Patients Using Basal Insulin and/or Oral
Agents
The evidence is insufficient regarding
when to prescribe SMBG and how often
testingisneededforpatientswhodonotuse
intensive insulin regimens, such as those
with type 2 diabetes using oral agents
and/or basal insulin. For patients using
basal insulin, assessing fasting glucose
with SMBG to inform dose adjustments
to achieve blood glucose targets results
in lower A1Cs (9,10).
For individuals with type 2 diabetes on
less intensive insulin therapy, more fre-
quent SMBG (e.g., fasting, before/after
meals) may be helpful, as increased fre-
quency is associated with meeting A1C
targets (11).
Several randomized trials have called
into question the clinical utility and cost-
effectiveness of routine SMBG in noninsu-
lin-treatedpatients(12–15). Meta-analyses
havesuggestedthatSMBGcanreduceA1C
by 0.25–0.3% at 6 months (16,17), but the
effect was attenuated at 12 months in
one analysis (16). A key consideration is
that performing SMBG alone does not
lower blood glucose levels. To be useful,
the information must be integrated into
clinical and self-management plans.
Continuous Glucose Monitoring
CGM measures interstitial glucose (which
correlates well with plasma glucose), and
mostCGMdevicesincludealarmsforhypo-
and hyperglycemic excursions. The inter-
mittent or “flash” CGM device, very re-
cently approved for adult use only (18),
differs from previous CGM devices. Spe-
cifically, it does not have alarms, does not
require calibration with SMBG, and does
not communicate continuously (only on
demand). It is reported to have a lower
cost than traditional systems. A study in
adults with well-controlled type 1 diabe-
tes found that flash CGM users spent less
time in hypoglycemia than those using
SMBG (19). However, due to significant
differences between flash CGM and other
CGM devices, more discussion is needed
on outcomes and regarding specific rec-
ommendations.
For most CGM systems, confirmatory
SMBG is required to make treatment de-
cisions, though a randomized controlled
trial of 226 adults suggested that an en-
hanced CGM device could be used safely
and effectively without regular confirma-
tory SMBG in patients with well-controlled
type 1 diabetes at low risk of severe hy-
poglycemia(1).Two CGM devices are now
approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Ad-
ministration (FDA) for making treatment
decisions without SMBG confirmation
(18,20), including the flash CGM device.
Although performed with older gener-
ation CGM devices, a 26-week random-
ized trial of 322 patients with type 1
diabetesshowedthatadultsaged$25 years
using intensive insulin therapy and CGM
experienced a 0.5% reduction in A1C
(from ;7.6% to 7.1% [;60 mmol/mol
to 54 mmol/mol]) compared with those
using intensive insulin therapy with SMBG
(21). The greatest predictor of A1C lower-
ing for all age-groups was frequency of
sensor use, which was highest in those
aged $25 years and lower in younger
age-groups. Two clinical trials in adults
with type 1 diabetes not meeting A1C
targets and using multiple daily injections
also found that the use of CGM compared
with usual care resulted in lower A1C levels
than SMBG over 24–26 weeks (22,23).
Other small, short-term studies have
demonstrated similar A1C reductions us-
ing CGM compared with SMBG in adults
with A1C levels $7% (53 mmol/mol)
(24,25).
A registry study of 17,317 participants
confirmed that more frequent CGM use is
associated with lower A1C (26), whereas
another study showed that children
with .70% sensor use (i.e., $5 days per
S56
Glycemic Targets
Diabetes Care Volume 41, Supplement 1, January 2018
 week) missed fewer school days (27).
Small randomized controlled trials in
adults and children with baseline A1C
,7.0–7.5% (53–58 mmol/mol) have con-
firmed favorable outcomes including a
reduced frequency of hypoglycemia (de-
fined as a blood glucose level ,70 mg/dL
[3.9 mmol/L]) and maintaining A1C ,7%
(53 mmol/mol) during the study period in
groups using CGM, suggesting that CGM
may provide further benefit for individu-
als with type 1 diabetes who already have
good glycemic control (28–30).
A meta-analysis suggests that com-
pared with SMBG, CGM is associated
with short-term A1C lowering of ;0.26%
in insulin-treated patients (31). The long-
term effectiveness of CGM needs to be
determined. This technology may be par-
ticularly useful in insulin-treated patients
with hypoglycemia unawareness and/or
frequent hypoglycemic episodes, although
studies have not shown consistent reduc-
tions in severe hypoglycemia (31–33). A
CGM device equipped with an automatic
low glucose suspend feature has been
approved by the FDA. The Automation
to Simulate Pancreatic Insulin Response
(ASPIRE) trial of 247 patients with type 1
diabetesand documented nocturnalhypo-
glycemia showed that sensor-augmented
insulin pump therapy with a low glucose
suspend function significantly reduced
nocturnal hypoglycemia over 3 months
without increasing A1C levels (34).
These devices may offer the opportunity
to reduce hypoglycemia for those with
a history of nocturnal hypoglycemia.
The FDA has also approved the first
hybrid closed-loop system. The safety of
hybrid closed-loop systems has been sup-
ported in the literature (35) and may have
advantages over sensor-augmented
pump therapy in specific populations,
such as pregnant women with type 1
diabetes (36).
Due to variable adherence, optimal
CGM use requires an assessment of indi-
vidual readiness for the technology as
well as initial and ongoing education
and support (26,37). Additionally, pro-
viders need to provide robust diabetes
education, training, and support for opti-
mal CGM implementation and ongoing
use. As people with type 1 or type 2
diabetes are living longer, healthier lives,
individuals who have been successfully
using CGM should have continued access
to these devices after they turn 65 years
of age (38).
A1C TESTING
Recommendations
c Perform the A1C test at least two
times a year in patients who are
meeting treatment goals (and who
have stable glycemic control). E
c Perform the A1C test quarterly in
patients whose therapy has changed
or who are not meeting glycemic
goals. E
c Point-of-care testingforA1Cprovides
the opportunity for more timely
treatment changes. E
A1C reflects average glycemia over
approximately 3 months and has strong
predictive value for diabetes complica-
tions (39,40). Thus, A1C testing should
be performed routinely in all patients
with diabetesdat initial assessment and
as part of continuing care. Measurement
approximately every 3 months deter-
mines whether patients’ glycemic targets
have been reached and maintained. The
frequency of A1C testing should depend
on the clinical situation, the treatment
regimen, and the clinician’s judgment.
The use of point-of-care A1C testing may
provide an opportunity for more timely
treatment changes during encounters be-
tween patients and providers. Patients
with type 2 diabetes with stable glycemia
well within target may do well with A1C
testing only twice per year. Unstable or
intensively managed patients (e.g., preg-
nant women with type 1 diabetes) may
require testingmore frequently than every
3 months (41).
A1C Limitations
The A1C test is an indirect measure of
average glycemia and, as such, is subject
to limitations. As with any laboratory test,
there is variability in the measurement of
A1C. Although suchvariabilityis lessonan
intraindividual basis than that of blood
glucose measurements, clinicians should
exercise judgment when using A1C as the
sole basis for assessing glycemic control,
particularly if the result is close to the
threshold that might prompt a change in
medicationtherapy.Conditionsthataffect
red blood cell turnover (hemolytic and
other anemias, recent blood transfusion,
use of drugs that stimulate erythropo-
esis, end-stage kidney disease, and
pregnancy) may result in discrepancies
between the A1C result and the pa-
tient’s true mean glycemia. Hemoglobin
variants must be considered, particularly
when the A1C result does not correlate
with the patient’s SMBG levels. Options
for monitoring include more frequent and/
or different timing of SMBG or CGM use.
Other measures of average glycemia such
as fructosamine and 1,5-anhydroglucitol
are available, but their translation into
average glucose levels and their prog-
nostic significance are not as clear as
for A1C. Though some variability exists
among different individuals, generally
the association between mean glucose
and A1C within an individual correlates
over time (42).
A1C does not provide a measure of
glycemic variability or hypoglycemia. For
patients prone to glycemic variability,
especially patients with type 1 diabetes
or type 2 diabetes with severe insulin de-
ficiency, glycemic control is best evalu-
ated by the combination of results from
A1C and SMBG or CGM. A1C may also
confirm the accuracy of the patient’s me-
ter (or the patient’s reported SMBG re-
sults) and the adequacy of the SMBG
testing schedule.
A1C and Mean Glucose
Table 6.1 shows the correlation between
A1C levels and mean glucose levels based
on two studies: the international A1C-
Derived Average Glucose (ADAG) study,
which assessed the correlation between
A1C and frequent SMBG and CGM in
507 adults (83% non-Hispanic whites)
with type 1, type 2, and no diabetes (43),
and an empirical study of the average
blood glucose levels at premeal, post-
meal, and bedtime associated with spec-
ified A1C levels using data from the
ADAG trial (37). The American Diabetes
Association (ADA) and the American As-
sociation for Clinical Chemistry have de-
terminedthat the correlation (r 5 0.92) in
the ADAG trial is strong enough to justify
reporting both the A1C result and the es-
timated average glucose (eAG) result
when a clinician orders the A1C test. Clini-
cians should note that the mean plasma
glucose numbers in the table are based on
;2,700 readings per A1C in the ADAG
trial. In a recent report, mean glucose
measured with CGM versus central labo-
ratory–measured A1C in 387 participants
in three randomized trials demonstrated
that A1C may underestimate or overesti-
mate mean glucose. Thus, as suggested, a
patient’s CGM profile has considerable
potential for optimizing his or her glyce-
mic management (42).

 A1C Differences in Ethnic Populations
and Children
In the ADAG study, there were no signif-
icant differences among racial and ethnic
groups in the regression lines between
A1C and mean glucose, although the
study was underpowered to detect a
difference and there was a trend toward
a difference between the African/African
American and non-Hispanic white co-
horts, with higher A1C values observed
in Africans/African Americans compared
with non-Hispanic whites for a given
mean glucose. Other studies have also
demonstratedhigher A1C levelsinAfrican
Americans than in whites at a given mean
glucose concentration (44,45). Moreover,
African Americans heterozygous for the
common hemoglobin variant HbS may
have, for any level of mean glycemia,
lower A1C by about 0.3 percentage points
than those without the trait (46). Another
genetic variant, X-linked glucose-6-phosphate
dehydrogenase G202A, carried by 11% of
African Americans, was associated with a
decrease in A1C of about 0.8% in hemi-
zygous men and 0.7% in homozygous
women compared to those without the
trait (47).
A small study comparing A1C to CGM
data in children with type 1 diabetes
found a highly statistically significant cor-
relation between A1C and mean blood glu-
cose, although the correlation (r 5 0.7) was
significantly lower than in the ADAG trial
(48). Whether there are clinically mean-
ingful differences in how A1C relates to
average glucose in children or in different
ethnicities is an area for further study
(44,49,50). Until further evidence is avail-
able, it seems prudent to establish A1C
goals in these populations with consider-
ation of both individualized SMBG and
A1C results.

Glycemic Targets

 can be achieved without significant
hypoglycemia or other adverse ef-
fects of treatment (i.e., polyphar-
macy). Appropriate patients might
include those with short duration of
diabetes, type 2 diabetes treated
with lifestyle or metformin only,
long life expectancy, or no signifi-
cant cardiovascular disease. C
c Less stringent A1C goals (such
as ,8% [64 mmol/mol]) may be ap-
propriate for patients with a history
of severe hypoglycemia, limited life
expectancy, advanced microvascu-
lar or macrovascular complications,
extensive comorbid conditions, or
long-standing diabetes in whom
the goal is difficult to achieve de-
spite diabetes self-management
education, appropriate glucose
monitoring, and effective doses of
multiple glucose-lowering agents
including insulin. B
A1C and Microvascular Complications
Hyperglycemia defines diabetes, and gly-
cemic control is fundamental to diabetes
management. The Diabetes Control and
Complications Trial (DCCT) (2), a prospec-
tive randomized controlled trial of inten-
sive versus standard glycemic control in
patients with type 1 diabetes, showed de-
finitively that better glycemic control is
associated with significantly decreased
rates of development and progression of
microvascular (retinopathy [51], neurop-
athy, and diabetic kidney disease) compli-
cations. Follow-up of the DCCT cohorts in
the Epidemiology of Diabetes Interven-
tions and Complications (EDIC) study
(52) demonstrated persistence of these
microvascular benefits despite the fact
that the glycemic separation between
the treatment groups diminished and dis-
appeared during follow-up.
The Kumamoto Study (53) and UK Pro-
spective Diabetes Study (UKPDS) (54,55)
confirmed that intensive glycemic control
significantly decreased rates of microvas-
cular complications in patients with type 2
diabetes. Long-term follow-up of the
UKPDS cohorts showed enduring effects
of early glycemic control on most micro-
vascular complications (56).
Therefore, achieving A1C targets
of ,7% (53 mmol/mol) has been shown
to reduce microvascular complications of
diabetes. Epidemiological analyses of the
DCCT (2) and UKPDS (57) demonstrate a
curvilinear relationship between A1C and
microvascular complications. Such anal-
yses suggest that, on a population level,
the greatest number of complications will
be averted by taking patients from very
poor control to fair/good control. These
analyses also suggest that further lower-
ing of A1C from 7% to 6% [53 mmol/mol
to 42 mmol/mol] is associated with fur-
ther reduction in the risk of microvascular
complications, although the absolute risk
reductions become much smaller. Given
the substantially increased risk of hypo-
glycemia in type 1 diabetes trials and
with polypharmacy in type 2 diabetes,
the risks of lower glycemic targets out-
weigh the potential benefits on microvas-
cular complications.
ACCORD, ADVANCE, and VADT
Three landmark trials (Action to Control
Cardiovascular Risk in Diabetes [ACCORD],
Action in Diabetes and Vascular Disease:
Preterax and Diamicron MR Controlled
Evaluation [ADVANCE], and Veterans Af-
fairs Diabetes Trial [VADT]) showed that
lower A1C levels were associated with re-
ducedonsetorprogression ofsomemicro-
vascular complications (58–60).
The concerning mortality findings in
the ACCORD trial (61), discussed below,
and the relatively intense efforts required
to achieve near-euglycemia should also
be considered when setting glycemic tar-
gets. However, on the basis of physician
judgment and patient preferences, select
patients, especially those with little co-
morbidity and long life expectancy, may
benefit from adopting more intensive gly-
cemic targets (e.g., A1C target ,6.5%
[48 mmol/mol]) as long as significant hy-
poglycemia does not become a barrier.
A1C and Cardiovascular Disease
Outcomes
Cardiovascular Disease and Type 1 Diabetes
Cardiovascular disease (CVD) is a more
commoncauseofdeaththanmicrovascular
complications in populations with diabetes.
There is evidence for a cardiovascular ben-
efit of intensive glycemic control after long-
term follow-up of cohorts treated early in
the course of type 1 diabetes. In the DCCT,
there was a trend toward lower risk of CVD
events with intensive control. In the 9-year
post-DCCT follow-up of the EDIC cohort,
participants previously randomized to the
intensive arm had a significant 57% reduc-
tion in the risk of nonfatal myocardial in-
farction (MI), stroke, or cardiovascular
death compared with those previously ran-
domized to the standard arm (62). The
benefit of intensive glycemic control in
this cohort with type 1 diabetes has
been shown to persist for several decades
(63) and to be associated with a modest
reduction in all-cause mortality (64).
Cardiovascular Disease and Type 2 Diabetes
In type 2 diabetes, there is evidence that
more intensive treatment of glycemia in
newly diagnosed patients may reduce
long-term CVD rates. During the UKPDS,
there was a 16% reduction in CVD events
(combined fatal or nonfatal MI and sud-
den death) in the intensive glycemic con-
trol arm that did not reach statistical
significance (P 5 0.052), and there was
no suggestion of benefit on other CVD
outcomes (e.g., stroke). However, after
10 years ofobservational follow-up,those
originally randomized to intensive glyce-
mic control had significant long-term re-
ductions in MI (15% with sulfonylurea or
insulin as initial pharmacotherapy, 33%
with metformin as initial pharmacother-
apy) and in all-cause mortality (13% and
27%, respectively) (56).
ACCORD, ADVANCE, and VADT sug-
gested no significant reduction in CVD
outcomes with intensive glycemic control
in participants followed for 3.5–5.6 years
who had more advanced type 2 diabetes
than UKPDS participants. All three trials
were conducted in relatively older partic-
ipants with longer known duration of di-
abetes (mean duration 8–11 years) and
either CVD or multiple cardiovascular risk
factors. The target A1C among intensive
control subjects was ,6% (42 mmol/mol)
in ACCORD, ,6.5% (48 mmol/mol) in
ADVANCE, and a 1.5% reduction in A1C
compared with control subjects in VADT,

Control and the Prevention of Cardiovas-
cular Events: Implications of the ACCORD,
ADVANCE, and VA Diabetes Trials” (65).
The glycemic control comparison in
ACCORD was halted early due to an in-
creased mortality rate in the intensive

arm (1.41% vs. 1.14% per year; hazard ra-
tio 1.22 [95% CI 1.01–1.46]), with a similar

 of the ACCORD data did not identify a
clear explanation for the excess mortality
in the intensive treatment arm (61).
Longer-termfollow-up hasshown no ev-
idence of cardiovascular benefit or harm in
the ADVANCE trial (66). The end-stage re-
nal diseaserate was lowerintheintensive
treatment group over follow-up. However,
10-year follow-up of the VADT cohort
(67) showed a reduction in the risk of car-
diovascular events (52.7 [control group]
vs. 44.1 [intervention group] events per
1,000 person-years) with no benefit in
cardiovascular or overall mortality. Hetero-
geneity of mortality effects across studies
was noted, which may reflect differences
in glycemic targets, therapeutic approaches,
and population characteristics (68).
Mortality findings in ACCORD (61) and
subgroup analyses of VADT (69) suggest
that the potential risks of intensive glyce-
mic control may outweigh its benefits in
higher-risk patients. In all three trials, se-
vere hypoglycemia was significantly more
likely in participants who were randomly
assigned to the intensive glycemic control
arm. Those patients with long duration of
diabetes, a known history of hypoglyce-
mia, advanced atherosclerosis, or ad-
vanced age/frailty may benefit from less
aggressive targets (70,71).
Providersshouldbevigilantinpreventing
hypoglycemia and should not aggressively
attempt to achieve near-normal A1C levels
in patients in whom such targets cannot be
safely and reasonably achieved. Severe or
frequent hypoglycemia is an absolute indi-
cation for the modification of treatment
regimens, including setting higher glycemic
goals.
Many factors, including patient prefer-
ences, shouldbetaken into accountwhen
developing a patient’s individualized
goals (Table 6.2).
A1C and Glycemic Targets
Numerous aspects must be considered
when setting glycemic targets. The ADA
proposes optimal targets, but each target
must be individualized to the needs of each
patient and his or her disease factors.
When possible, such decisions should be
made with the patient, reflecting his or her
preferences, needs, and values. Fig. 6.1
is not designed to be applied rigidly but
to be used as a broad construct to guide
clinical decision-making (72), in both type 1
and type 2 diabetes.
Recommended glycemic targets for
many nonpregnant adults are shown in
Table 6.2. The recommendations include
blood glucose levels that appear to corre-
late with achievement of an A1C of ,7%
(53 mmol/mol). The issue of preprandial
versus postprandial SMBG targets is com-
plex (73). Elevatedpostchallenge (2-horal
glucose tolerance test) glucose values
have been associated with increased car-
diovascular risk independent of fasting
plasma glucose in some epidemiological
studies, but intervention trials have not
shown postprandial glucose to be a cardio-
vascular risk factor independent of A1C. In
subjectswithdiabetes,surrogatemeasures
of vascular pathology, such as endothelial
dysfunction, arenegatively affected bypost-
prandial hyperglycemia. It is clear that post-
prandial hyperglycemia, like preprandial
hyperglycemia, contributes to elevated
A1C levels, with its relative contribution be-
ing greater at A1C levels that are closer to
7% (53 mmol/mol). However, outcome
studies have clearly shown A1C to be the
primary predictor of complications, and
landmark trials of glycemic control such as
the DCCT and UKPDS relied overwhelmingly
on preprandial SMBG. Additionally, a ran-
domized controlled trial in patients with
known CVD found no CVD benefit of insulin
regimens targeting postprandial glucose
compared with those targeting preprandial
glucose (74). Therefore, it is reasonable for
postprandial testing to be recommended
for individuals who have premeal glucose
values within target but have A1C values
above target. Measuring postprandial
plasma glucose 1–2 h after the start of a
meal and using treatments aimed at

 reducing postprandial plasma glucose val-

Ananalysisofdatafrom470participants
in the ADAG study (237 with type 1 diabe-
tes and 147 with type 2 diabetes) found
that actual average glucose levels associ-
ated with conventional A1C targets were
higher than older DCCT and ADA targets

HYPOGLYCEMIA
Recommendations
c Individuals at risk for hypoglycemia
should be asked about symptom-
atic and asymptomatic hypoglyce-
mia at each encounter. C
c Glucose (15–20 g) is the preferred
treatment for the conscious individ-
ual with blood glucose #70 mg/dL
[3.9 mmol/L]), although any form of
carbohydrate that contains glucose
may be used. Fifteen minutes after
treatment, if SMBG shows contin-
ued hypoglycemia, the treatment
should be repeated. Once SMBG
returns to normal, the individual
should consume a meal or snack to
preventrecurrenceofhypoglycemia.E
c Glucagon should be prescribed for
all individuals at increased risk of
clinically significant hypoglycemia,
defined as blood glucose ,54 mg/dL
(3.0 mmol/L), so it is available should
it be needed. Caregivers, school
personnel, or family members of
these individuals should know
where it is and when and how to
administer it. Glucagon administra-
tion is not limited to health care
professionals. E
c Hypoglycemia unawareness or one
or more episodes of severe hypo-
glycemia should trigger reevalua-
tion of the treatment regimen. E
c Insulin-treated patients with hy-
poglycemia unawareness or an
episode of clinically significant hy-
poglycemia should be advised to
raise their glycemic targets to
strictly avoid hypoglycemia for at
least several weeks in order to par-
tially reverse hypoglycemia un-
awareness and reduce risk of future
episodes. A
c Ongoing assessment of cognitive
functionissuggestedwith increased
vigilance for hypoglycemia by the
clinician, patient, and caregivers if
low cognition or declining cognition
is found. B
Hypoglycemia is the major limiting factor
in the glycemic management of type 1
and type 2 diabetes. Recommendations
fromthe InternationalHypoglycemia Study
Group regarding the classification of hypo-
glycemia in clinical trials are outlined in Ta-
ble 6.3 (75). Of note, this classification
scheme considers a blood glucose ,54
mg/dL (3.0 mmol/L) detected by SMBG,
CGM (for at least 20 min), or laboratory
measurement of plasma glucose as suffi-
ciently low to indicate clinically significant
hypoglycemia that should be included in
reports of clinical trials of glucose-lowering
drugs for the treatment of diabetes (75).
However, a hypoglycemia alert value
of#70 mg/dL(3.9mmol/L) can beimpor-
tant for therapeutic dose adjustment of
glucose-loweringdrugsinclinical careand
is often related to symptomatic hypogly-
cemia. Severe hypoglycemia is defined as
severe cognitive impairment requiring as-
sistance from another person for recov-
ery (76).
Symptoms of hypoglycemia include,
but are not limited to, shakiness, irritabil-
ity, confusion, tachycardia, and hunger.
Hypoglycemia may be inconvenient or
frightening to patients with diabetes. Se-
vere hypoglycemia may be recognized or
unrecognized and can progress to loss of
consciousness, seizure, coma, ordeath.Itis
reversed by administration of rapid-acting
glucose or glucagon. Clinically significant
hypoglycemia can cause acute harm to
the person with diabetes or others, espe-
cially if it causes falls, motor vehicle acci-
dents, or other injury. A large cohort study
suggested that among older adults with
type 2 diabetes, a history of severe hypo-
glycemia was associated with greater risk
of dementia (77). Conversely, in a sub-
study of the ACCORD trial, cognitive
impairment at baseline or decline in cog-
nitive function during the trial was sig-
nificantly associated with subsequent
episodes of severe hypoglycemia (78). Ev-
idence from DCCT/EDIC, which involved
adolescents and younger adults with
type 1 diabetes, found no association be-
tween frequency of severe hypoglycemia
and cognitive decline (79), as discussed in
Section 12 “Children and Adolescents.”
Severe hypoglycemia was associated
with mortality in participants in both the
standard and the intensive glycemia arms
of the ACCORD trial, but the relationships
between hypoglycemia, achieved A1C,
and treatment intensity were not straight-
forward. An association of severe hypo-
glycemia with mortality was also found
in the ADVANCE trial (80). An association
between self-reported severe hypoglyce-
mia and 5-year mortality has also been
reported in clinical practice (81).
Young children with type 1 diabetes and
theelderly,includingthosewithtype1and
type 2 diabetes (77,82), are noted as par-
ticularly vulnerable to clinically significant
hypoglycemia because of their reduced
ability to recognize hypoglycemic symp-
toms and effectively communicate their
needs. Individualized glucose targets, pa-
tient education,dietaryintervention (e.g.,
bedtime snack to prevent overnight hypo-
glycemia when specifically needed to treat

 low blood glucose), exercise management,
medication adjustment, glucose monitor-
ing, and routine clinical surveillance may
improve patient outcomes (76). CGM with
automated low glucose suspend has been
shown to be effective in reducing hypogly-
cemia in type 1 diabetes (34). For patients
with type 1 diabetes with severe hypogly-
cemia and hypoglycemia unawareness
that persists despite medical treatment,
human islet transplantation may be an op-
tion, but the approach remains experimen-
tal (83,84).
In 2015, the ADA changed its prepran-
dial glycemic target from 70–130 mg/dL
(3.9–7.2 mmol/L) to 80–130 mg/dL (4.4–
7.2mmol/L).Thischangereflectstheresults
of the ADAG study, which demonstrated
that higher glycemic targets corresponded
to A1C goals (37). An additional goal of
raising the lower range of the glycemic
target was to limit overtreatment and
provide a safety margin in patients titrat-
ing glucose-lowering drugs such as insulin
to glycemic targets.
Hypoglycemia Treatment
Providers should continue to counsel
patients to treat hypoglycemia with fast-
acting carbohydrates at the hypoglycemia
alert value of 70 mg/dL (3.9 mmol/L) or
less. Hypoglycemia treatment requires
ingestion of glucose- or carbohydrate-
containing foods. The acute glycemic re-
sponse correlates better with the glucose
content of food than with the carbohy-
drate content of food. Pure glucose is
the preferred treatment, but any form
of carbohydrate that contains glucose
will raise blood glucose. Added fat may
retard and then prolong the acute glyce-
mic response. In type 2 diabetes, ingested
protein may increase insulin response
without increasing plasma glucose con-
centrations (85). Therefore, carbohydrate
sources high in protein should not be
used to treat or prevent hypoglycemia.
Ongoing insulin activity or insulin secreta-
gogues may lead to recurrent hypoglyce-
mia unless further food is ingested after
recovery. Once the glucose returns to
normal, the individual should be coun-
seled to eat a meal or snack to prevent
recurrent hypoglycemia.
Glucagon
The use of glucagon is indicated for the
treatment of hypoglycemia in people un-
able or unwilling to consume carbohy-
drates by mouth. Those in close contact
with, or having custodial care of, people
with hypoglycemia-prone diabetes (fam-
ily members, roommates, school person-
nel, child care providers, correctional
institution staff, or coworkers) should be
instructed on the use of glucagon kits in-
cluding where the kit is and when and
howtoadministerglucagon.Anindividual
does not need to be a health care pro-
fessional to safely administer glucagon.
Care should be taken to ensure that glu-
cagon kits are not expired.
Hypoglycemia Prevention
Hypoglycemia prevention is a critical com-
ponent of diabetes management. SMBG
and, for some patients, CGM are essential
toolstoassesstherapyanddetectincipient
hypoglycemia. Patients should understand
situations that increase their risk of hypo-
glycemia, such as fasting for tests or pro-
cedures, delayed meals, during or after
intense exercise, and during sleep. Hypo-
glycemia may increase the risk of harm to
self or others, such as with driving. Teach-
ing people with diabetes to balance insulin
use and carbohydrate intake and exercise
are necessary, but these strategies are not
always sufficient for prevention.
In type 1 diabetes and severely insulin-
deficient type 2 diabetes, hypoglycemia
unawareness (or hypoglycemia-associated
autonomic failure) can severely com-
promisestringentdiabetescontrolandquality
of life. This syndrome is characterized by de-
ficient counterregulatory hormone release,
especially in older adults, and a diminished
autonomic response, which both are risk fac-
tors for, and caused by, hypoglycemia. A cor-
ollary to this “vicious cycle” is that several
weeks of avoidance of hypoglycemia has
been demonstrated to improve counterregu-
lation and hypoglycemia awareness in many
patients (86). Hence, patients with one or
more episodes of clinically significant hy-
poglycemia may benefit from at least
short-term relaxation of glycemic targets.
INTERCURRENT ILLNESS
For further information on management
of patients with hyperglycemia in the hos-
pital, please refer to Section 14 “Diabetes
Care in the Hospital.”
Stressful events(e.g., illness, trauma, sur-
gery,etc.)mayworsenglycemiccontroland
precipitate diabetic ketoacidosis or nonke-
totic hyperosmolar state, life-threatening
conditions that require immediate medical
care to prevent complications and death.
Any condition leading to deterioration
in glycemic control necessitates more fre-
quent monitoring of blood glucose; ketosis-
prone patients also require urine or
blood ketone monitoring. If accompa-
nied by ketosis, vomiting, or alteration in
the level of consciousness, marked hyper-
glycemia requires temporary adjustment of
the treatment regimen and immediate in-
teraction with the diabetes care team. The
patienttreated with noninsulin therapiesor
medical nutrition therapy alone may tem-
porarily require insulin. Adequate fluid and
caloric intake must be ensured. Infection or
dehydration is more likely to necessitate
hospitalization of the person with diabetes
than the person without diabetes.
A physician with expertise in diabetes
management should treat the hospital-
ized patient. For further information on
the management of diabetic ketoacidosis
and the hyperglycemic nonketotic hyper-
osmolarstate, pleaserefertothe ADAcon-
sensus report “Hyperglycemic Crises in
Adult Patients With Diabetes” (87).
