implications for the evaluation of 
Antidepressants’ efficacy and Harm

Background: In current psychiatric practice, antidepressants are widely and with 
ever-increasing frequency prescribed to patients. However, several scientific biases 
obfuscate estimates of antidepressants’ efficacy and harm, and these are barely rec-
ognized in treatment guidelines. The aim of this mini-review is to critically evaluate the 
efficacy and harm of antidepressants for acute and maintenance treatment with respect 
to systematic biases related to industry funding and trial methodology.
Methods: Narrative review based on a comprehensive search of the literature.
Results: It is shown that the pooled efficacy of antidepressants is weak and below 
the threshold of a minimally clinically important change once publication and reporting 
biases are considered. Moreover, the small mean difference in symptom reductions 
relative to placebo is possibly attributable to observer effects in unblinded assessors and 
patient expectancies. With respect to trial dropout rates, a hard outcome not subjected 
to observer bias, no difference was observed between antidepressants and placebo. 
The discontinuation trials on the efficacy of antidepressants in maintenance therapy are 
systematically flawed, because in these studies, spontaneous remitters are excluded, 
whereas half of all patients who remitted on antidepressants are abruptly switched to 
placebo. This can cause a severe withdrawal syndrome that is easily misdiagnosed as a 
relapse when assessed on subjective symptom rating scales. In accordance, the findings 
of naturalistic long-term studies suggest that maintenance therapy has no clear benefit, 
and non-drug users do not show increased recurrence rates. Moreover, a growing body 
of evidence from hundreds of randomized controlled trials suggests that antidepressants 
cause suicidality, but this risk is underestimated because data from industry-funded trials 
are systematically flawed. Unselected, population-wide observational studies indicate 
that depressive patients who use antidepressants are at an increased risk of suicide and 
that they have a higher rate of all-cause mortality than matched controls.
Conclusion: The strong reliance on industry-funded research results in an uncritical 
approval of antidepressants. Due to several flaws such as publication and reporting 
bias, unblinding of outcome assessors, concealment and recoding of serious adverse 
events, the efficacy of antidepressants is systematically overestimated, and harm is 
systematically underestimated. Therefore, I conclude that antidepressants are largely 
ineffective and potentially harmful.

Antidepressants’ Efficacy and Harm
Frontiers in Psychiatry | www.frontiersin.org
December 2017 | Volume 8 | Article 275
Treatment guidelines for major depression (MD) in Europe and 
the United States typically recommend antidepressant medication 
with or without psychotherapy (1). In particular, the American 
Psychiatric Association (APA) advises antidepressants as first-
line treatment for all forms of MD, including mild episodes 
(2). The APA further recommends antidepressants not only for 
acute treatment but also for continuation therapy (approximately 
4–9 months) and maintenance therapy (several years up to 
indefinite time). Overall, the APA treatment guidelines for adult 
MD provide are very favorable risk–benefit analysis for selective 
serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) and serotonin norepineph-
rine reuptake inhibitors (SNRIs), suggesting that these drug 
classes are highly effective, well tolerated, and safe. However, 
paradoxically the massive increase in antidepressant prescription 
rates over the last three decades did not translate into measurable 
public health benefits (3–5). From a public mental health per-
spective, we would expect that effective antidepressants reduce 
the prevalence and burden of MD, unless the scientific evidence 
is unreliable. In the following, I will therefore provide a critical re-
examination of antidepressants’ efficacy and safety. I will mostly 
rely on evidence from randomized controlled trials (RCTs), as 
these are considered gold-standard to establish causality and 
efficacy of clinical interventions. Although RCTs are less prone 
to bias than observational studies, they also have limitations, in 
particular in industry-funded pharmacological research (6–8). A 
special emphasis will hence be given to the unduly ties between 
scientific psychiatry and the pharmaceutical industry (9–11). I 
will first examine antidepressants’ efficacy for acute treatment, 
proceed with a review of their efficacy for continuation and 
maintenance therapy, and close with an outline of severe harms. 
Scientific biases will be discussed in context, as they substantially 
inflate antidepressants’ public health significance.
ACUTe THeRAPY
Research funded by the pharmaceutical industry is systemati-
cally biased toward their marketed products (12–15). That is, the 
estimated efficacy of pharmaceutical products is significantly 
higher when the research was funded by the industry compared 
to non-industry funding, but this difference is not attributable to 
differences in the study quality (13, 14). For instance, research 
funded and conducted by the NIMH largely failed to demonstrate 
a clear difference between antidepressants and placebo, despite 
adequate sample sizes and strong RCT methodology [e.g., Ref. 
(16, 17)]. Research conducted by authors with financial conflicts 
of interest (COI) related to the pharmaceutical industry is 
likewise systematically biased in favor of the industry’s vested 
interests (18–20). That is, efficacy of pharmacological treatments 
is overestimated, whereas harms are underreported. Due to the 
pervasive entanglement of psychiatry with the pharmaceutical 
industry (9–11, 21), these biases undermine the validity of the 
scientific literature on antidepressants’ efficacy. For instance, it is 
now clearly established that many industry-funded antidepres-
sant trials were never published, and if published, some results 
were inadequately presented in a favorable way (15, 22, 23). 
That is, trials with negative results are either not published or 
negative results are distorted to appear positive (7, 24). Outcome 
reporting bias is a common scientific flaw and means that authors 
conceal the effect of the prespecified primary efficacy outcome 
and instead choose to report the most convenient from different 
secondary outcomes (25). Also, harms and serious adverse events 
of antidepressants are often not reported, and such concealment 
is strongly related to authors’ financial COI and industry funding 
(26). Another common flaw is to report efficacy based on drug-
placebo differences in response and remission rates (27). To come 
at binary constructs such as response and remission, continuous 
symptom rating scales are dichotomized along arbitrary cut-offs. 
However, methodologists have vigorously advised against the use 
of dichotomization (28–30) because it produces, among others, 
systematically inflated effect sizes (31–33). Most short-term effi-
cacy RCTs were conducted to receive marketing approval from 
regulatory agencies. To ensure that drug-placebo differences in 
the outcome are clearly attributable to the intervention, efficacy 
RCT use preselected groups of participants tested under ideal 
clinical settings (34). Therefore, trial conditions markedly deviate 
from real-world clinical settings, and the included participants are 
not representative of the patient population seen in routine clini-
cal practice. Specifically, RCT exclude a majority of MD patients 
due to comorbid disorders and suicidal ideation (35). Included 
participants are less impaired and have a higher level of function-
ing (36, 37), and it has been demonstrated that they respond 
better to antidepressants than the average real-world patient (36).
Meta-analyses that include unpublished trials and that exam-
ine mean differences in continuous depression rating scales report 
statistically significant but marginally small differences between 
antidepressants and placebo (23, 38–40). More recent studies 
have suggested that drug-placebo differences are larger when 
instead of heterogeneous sum-scores, which also include somatic 
symptoms, only depressive core symptoms were considered (41, 
42). However, the results barely support this conclusion, because 
estimated effect sizes are still small and considered clinically 
insignificant per convention. But what exactly means clinically 
significant? In general, clinical significance refers to an effect size 
d or g > 0.5 or a difference >3 points on the Hamilton Depression 
Scale for Depression (HAMD) (38). However, empirical evidence 
has suggested that at least 7 points on the HAMD or an effect size 
>0.87 is necessary for a clinician to observe a minimal improve-
ment in depression symptoms (43). Based on these criteria, the 
efficacy of antidepressants is impossible to discern from placebo 
effects in any meta-analysis conducted thus far.
Some authors deem the small difference between antidepres-
sants and placebo a methodological artifact (27, 44–46). For 
instance, Chen et al. (47) re-analyzed a double-blind RCT with 
the treatment arms antidepressant (sertraline), St John’s Wort, and 
placebo, with respect to patients’ treatment beliefs. Depression 
symptom reduction did not differ between treatment arms. 
However, independent of actual treatment received, patients 
who believed they receive placebo showed less improvement, 
and patients who correctly guessed that they receive placebo 
improved even less. One hypothesis states that the assumption 
of blinding is violated even in double-blind RCT, because both 
patients and outcome assessors may correctly guess who receives 
placebo due to a suspicious lack of side effects (44). Such unblind-
ing effects inflate the apparent efficacy of antidepressants, because

unblinded outcome assessors systematically overestimate the 
efficacy of experimental interventions (48, 49). Taking into 
account the unblinding bias, Gotzsche (50) calculated that the 
average efficacy of antidepressants does not differ from placebo. 
More reliable than differences in subjective rating scales are 
objective outcomes such as premature treatment termination. 
Several meta-analyses did not detect a noticeable difference 
between antidepressant and placebo arms with respect to overall 
dropout rates in short-term RCT (51–53). Assuming that patients 
prematurely terminate a free treatment only if they perceived it as 
useless or even harmful (54), these findings indicate that the aver-
age patient experiences no clear benefits from antidepressants.

There are two trial designs to examine effects of long-term antide-
pressant use. The first is the long-term parallel-arm efficacy trial, 
where responders to both antidepressants and placebo are followed 
up. The second, much more common design, is the discontinua-
tion trial, where antidepressant responders are randomly assigned 
to either continued therapy or rapid discontinuation and switch-
ing to placebo. In a recent meta-analysis of long-term parallel-arm 
RCT of 6–8 months duration, no difference between groups was 
found with respect to both remission and treatment discontinu-
ation rates (55). Meta-analyses of discontinuation trials suggest 
that long-term antidepressant use may prevent relapse, but only 
very few trials have empirically examined that effect for 2 years 
or more (56, 57). In addition, effects in discontinuation trials are 
difficult to interpret, because they exclusively include participants 
who remitted during acute open-label antidepressant treatment. 
Therefore, it is not known how many patients would have relapsed 
if they had remitted spontaneously, i.e., without prior acute anti-
depressant therapy (55). This is a serious issue, because it has been 
argued that antidepressants prospectively increase the relapse 
rate due to pharmacodynamics (58, 59). Another problem with 
discontinuation trials is the rapid discontinuation of antidepres-
sants and immediate switching to placebo given the ambiguous 
nature of subsequently emerging symptoms (60). Research has 
shown that antidepressants may cause severe withdrawal symp-
toms after discontinuation (61, 62), which in some cases persist 
for months and therefore are easily misdiagnosed as depression 
relapse (63). That is, a substantial portion of depression relapses 
in discontinuation trials are in fact discontinuation or withdrawal 
syndromes. In support of this notion, it has been shown that rapid 
discontinuation of antidepressants, relative to gradual tapering, 
prospectively increases the risk of depression reoccurrence (64), 
but note that even very slow tapering may cause severe mood 
disturbances (61, 63). It has further been shown that the preven-
tive effects of antidepressants dissipate after 1–3 months (65). At 
the latest after 6 months, the risk of re-occurrences is identical in 
antidepressant and placebo arms (66).
Some authors suggest that long-term antidepressant use 
may increase the vulnerability for (recurrent) depression due to 
neurochemical sensitization (58, 59). In support of this thesis, a 
recent meta-analysis revealed that the relapse risk after antide-
pressant discontinuation correlates positively with the duration 
of preceding acute therapy (57). That is, the longer antidepres-
sant treatment, the higher the relapse risk after discontinuation. 
Moreover, several meta-analyses showed that psychotherapy 
reduces the long-term relapse risk significantly more than phar-
macotherapy, despite both therapies being equally effective dur-
ing acute therapy (67, 68). A systematic review of observational 
long-term studies found that maintenance therapy conveys no 
clear benefits: antidepressant users had no better long-term out-
come than non-users (69). In an observational study of patients 
with remitted recurrent depression, maintenance therapy related 
to a higher recurrence rate than discontinuation (70). Other 
observational studies likewise suggest that antidepressant use 
may worsen the long-term outcome (71, 72), but causality is 
uncertain due to confounding by indication. A few highly cited 
epidemiologic studies reported that long-term antidepressant 
medication relates to lower relapse rates, but these have been 
shown to be methodologically flawed: when properly analyzed, 
maintenance therapy is not associated with lower relapse rates 
(73). Finally, according to the re-analysis of STAR*D (54), only 
5.8% of all patients who entered continuation therapy were still in 
remission after 12-month follow-up. A total of 37.4% of remitted 
patients, and altogether 64.4% of improved patients had a relapse 
within the first 12 months of continuation therapy.
SeveRe HARM
In children, adolescents and young adults up to 25 years, 
several meta-analyses of short-term RCT have confirmed that 
antidepressants, relative to placebo, significantly increase suicide 
risk (74–77). Moreover, there is now increasing evidence from 
several RCT and a few well-controlled observational studies that 
antidepressants may increase suicide risk in adults of any age. 
On the basis of Bayes’ statistics, Aursnes et al. (78) calculated 
that paroxetine, compared to placebo, may cause suicide with 
a certainty of 98–99%. Baldessarini et al. (79) meta-analyzed 
long-term RCT for adult MD and found a markedly increased 
rate of completed and attempted suicides in antidepressant arms 
compared to placebo. With respect to suicidality, i.e., suicide 
attempts, self-harm, and suicidal ideation combined, a meta-
analysis found that antidepressants convey a 2.5 times increased 
risk (80). Another meta-analysis found that paroxetine increases 
suicidality in adults aged 18 years and older by a factor 2.6 (51). 
Gunnell et al. (81) found weak meta-analytic evidence for a 
slightly increased risk of self-harm in antidepressant users, but 
not with respect to suicides or suicidal ideation. The recent meta-
analysis by Sharma et al. (75) did not find increased suicidality 
in adult antidepressant users relative to placebo. In contrast to 
that, Stone et al. (76) meta-analyzed data from pharmaceutical 
companies submitted to the FDA and found that suicidality was 
slightly increased in placebo groups for adults aged 25–64 years 
(relative risk: 1.3), and it was even markedly increased in adults 
aged 65 years and older (relative risk: 2.7). These findings suggest 
that antidepressants may protect against suicide in middle-aged 
and older adults, which conflicts with the findings of all other 
meta-analyses detailed above. However, the work by Stone 
et al. (76) was criticized, because many cases of suicidality were 
evidently missing in antidepressant treatment arms (50). In

accordance, many authors concluded that industry-funded trials 
are unreliable, as they willingly underreport cases of suicidality 
in antidepressant arms (80, 81), for instance by coding suicide 
attempts as “emotional lability” (75).
Just as the apparent efficacy of antidepressants is overestimated 
due to publication and reporting biases (15, 23), the pharmaceuti-
cal industry conceals harms by underreporting serious adverse 
events (14, 52, 82). Because RCT typically excludes severely 
impaired persons with suicidal ideation (35, 36), they run the 
risk to overlook a pernicious risk. Therefore, industry-funded 
research systematically underestimates the harm caused by their 
marketed drugs (14). Although scientifically less stringent (due 
to confounding by indication), I therefore need to consider 
well-controlled observational studies conducted by researchers 
without COI. An advantage of observational studies is that they 
can encompass much longer time frames than the short-term 
RCT typically lasting only 6–8 weeks. Due to much larger sam-
ples, observation studies allow for detecting harms occurring at 
low absolute frequency (34). A large naturalistic study with close 
to 240,000 persons with MD aged between 20 and 64 years found 
that antidepressant users committed 2.6 times more often suicide 
than non-users (83). Another well-controlled observational study 
based on a national register of 5,866 suicides showed that antide-
pressant use increases the odds of committing suicide 2.7 times 
in women and 4.3 times in men, with a clear increase in risk with 
higher age (84). Finally, several ecologic studies supposedly show 
a negative correlation between national antidepressant sales/
prescriptions and suicide rates (suggesting that antidepressants 
prevent suicide), but these studies are substantially flawed (85) 
and some were clearly disconfirmed (3, 5).
Naturalistic studies with high power have further shown that 
antidepressant use prospectively relates to all-cause mortality. 
For instance, in a study with over 60,000 patients with MD aged 
65 years and older, it was shown that over a mean follow-up of 
5.0 years, prescription of tricyclics increase the relative mortality 
rate by 16%, SSRI by 54%, and other antidepressants (mostly 
SNRI) by 66% (86). In another prospective observational study 
including over 136,000 postmenopausal women, it was shown 
that SSRI increase the relative mortality rate by 32% and tricy-
clics by 67% (87). Finally, a recent meta-analysis showed that 
antidepressants increase the all-cause mortality risk by 33% in 
the general population with no difference between SSRI and 
tricyclics (88). Due to thorough multivariate statistical modeling, 
it is unlikely that confounding by indication may account for all 
these effects. Moreover, in psychiatric outpatients, antidepressant 
use is higher in persons with low distress (89), whereas in primary 
care, most antidepressants are prescribed to persons without a 
psychiatric diagnosis (90). Hence, it is possible that confounding 
by indication may even underestimate the true harm attributable 
to antidepressant use. Therefore, a reasonable conclusion is that 
antidepressants disrupt adaptive bodily processes such as diges-
tion, immune function, tissue repair, metabolism, etc., which may 
lead to premature death (91, 92).
COnCLUSiOn
The results of this mini-review suggest that the efficacy of antide-
pressants is systematically overestimated, while potential harms 
are underreported and neglected. Despite these alarming findings, 
thought leaders within mainstream psychiatry and official treat-
ment guidelines strongly recommend antidepressant use for acute 
and long-term therapy. However, mainstream psychiatry is closely 
tied to the pharmaceutical industry, and most leading psychiatric 
experts receive substantial amounts of financial support from the 
industry (9, 11, 21). Thus, it is crucial to reiterate that industry-
funded trials and research conducted by authors with financial 
COI is systematically biased toward the pharmaceutical industry’s 
vested interests (13, 14, 20). The strong alliance between scientific 
psychiatry and the pharmaceutical industry is problematic and 
should be subjected to close scrutiny (9–11, 24). Moreover, there 
is an ongoing debate, whether antidepressant therapy is more 
efficacious in severe, rather endogenous MD compared to milder, 
reactive MD (27). Some meta-analytic evidence suggests that this 
is indeed the case (93), but other failed to replicate this finding 
(40). Finally, the evidence reviewed in this article relied mostly 
on RCT, which are also subject to bias (34, 94). Theoretically, 
these biases could result in an underestimation of antidepressant 
efficacy, but evidence from real-world effectiveness trials strongly 
argues otherwise, since real-world patients are more impaired and 
respond significantly worse to antidepressant therapy (36, 37). 
Finally, it has been argued that the efficacy of antidepressants is 
underestimated in more recent trials due to marked increases in 
placebo responses over time. However, that claim is false. A recent 
meta-analysis has clearly shown that the placebo response rate has 
been stable for almost 30 years now (95). As concerns treatment 
recommendations, my reading of the literature is that some patients 
may benefit from acute pharmacotherapy, but on average clinical 
benefits are debatable and should be weighed against adverse side 
effects (38, 39, 51). Continuation and maintenance therapy is not 
recommended due to an apparent lack of clear clinical benefits 
(54, 55, 96), coupled with a possibly increased vulnerability to 
chronic depression (58, 97), increased suicide risk (79, 83), and, in 
particular in older adults, higher all-cause mortality (86, 88, 98).
