ABSTRACT
Objectives: To determine the extent and distribution 
of workforce shortages within the nation’s medical 
laboratories.
Methods: The 2016-2017 Vacancy Survey was conducted 
through collaboration between the American Society for 
Clinical Pathology’s Institute of Science, Technology, 
& Policy in Washington, DC, and the Evaluation, 
Measurement, and Assessment division and Board of 
Certification in Chicago, Illinois. Data were collected via 
an internet survey that was distributed to individuals who 
were able to report on staffing and certifications for their 
laboratories.
Results: Results of the 2016-2017 Vacancy Survey shows 
decreased vacancy rates for laboratory positions across all 
departments surveyed compared with 2014. While overall, 
the data show that vacancy rates are decreasing, overall 
retirement rates and certification requirements are higher.
Conclusions: Focus on the qualifications and certification 
status of laboratory professionals would be crucial factors 
in addressing the needs of the laboratory workforce. The 
field needs to intensify its efforts on recruiting the next 
generation of laboratory personnel.
Since 1988, the American Society for Clinical 
Pathology (ASCP) has conducted its Vacancy Survey 
to determine the extent and distribution of workforce 
shortages within the nation’s medical laboratories. This 
confidential survey has been administered every 2 years 
and has served as the primary source of information 
for academic, government, and industry labor analysts. 
Results from past surveys show that laboratory medicine 
is a rapidly evolving field. Although the ASCP recognizes 
the importance of continuity, each administration of the 
Vacancy Survey represents an opportunity to improve its 
method to collect the most current relevant data while 
maximizing survey participation. The survey has evolved 
in response to changes within the profession; new ques-
tions were added to the 2016-2017 survey to examine 
some of the factors affecting vacancy rates. The ASCP 
continues to gather questions, comments, and suggestions 
from our members regarding the profession with the goal 
of addressing them through this important survey.
Materials and Methods
The 2016-2017 Vacancy Survey was conducted 
through collaboration between ASCP’s Institute of 
Science, Technology, & Policy in Washington, DC, and 
the Evaluation, Measurement, and Assessment division 
and Board of Certification in Chicago, Illinois. The 
Vacancy Survey Working Group, whose members work 
in the field of laboratory medicine, reviewed the survey 
questions and critiqued the report. Partner organizations

were also invited to participate in completing the survey 
to get a larger scope of the current issues faced by the 
laboratory workforce. Electronic survey invitations were 
sent on October 24, 2016, via Key Survey (an online sur-
vey tool). The survey was closed on January 10, 2017. To 
maximize response, this survey used snowball sampling, 
in which respondents were asked to forward the invitation 
email message to other individuals currently practicing in 
the field.
Most of the names on the initial email recipient list 
were derived from the ASCP database and included indi-
viduals from the following categories: lead, supervisor/
manager, educator, laboratory director, and educator/lab-
oratory director who can report on vacancies, anticipated 
vacancies, and certifications of staff.
The following partnering entities also participated in 
the survey:
• AABB (formerly the American Association of Blood 
Banks)
• American Association for Clinical Chemistry
• American Society of Cytopathology
• American Society for Clinical Laboratory Science
• American Society for Microbiology
• Clinical Laboratory Management Association
• National Society for Histotechnology
• Philippine Association of Medical Technologists–USA
• St Louis University
The 2016-2017 Vacancy Survey sought to col-
lect staff- and supervisory-level data for the following 
laboratory areas:
• Anatomic pathology (including non-MD professionals)
• Blood bank (immunohematology)
• Chemistry/toxicology
• Core laboratory
• Cytogenetics
• Cytology
• Flow cytometry
• Hematology/coagulation
• Histology
• Immunology
• Laboratory information system/quality assurance/per-
formance improvement (LIS/QA/PI) (new laboratory 
area surveyed)
• Microbiology/virology/infectious disease
• Molecular biology/diagnostics/molecular pathology
• Phlebotomy
• Point-of-care
• Send-outs
• Specimen processing
ASCP survey administrators recognize that there is 
no standard approach for how laboratories are organized 
and that laboratory areas hire staff with a variety of cer-
tifications. The ASCP provided survey participants with 
the opportunity to report on the certifications that exist 
or are sought after for the laboratory area under their 
supervision.
Key Findings
The primary objective of this research was to estimate 
the rate of shortages within medical laboratory departments. 
Overall, this survey presents data from 1,340 respondents 
across the United States who currently hold a manage-
ment-level position or human resources position and are 
able to discuss the vacancies, anticipated vacancies, and 
certifications/expertise of medical laboratory staff at their 
current place of employment. These respondents represent 
51,586 employees (a 55.56% increase in employee represen-
tation compared with 2014) across the United States.
The respondents came from various laboratory facil-
ities (from academic and nonacademic hospitals with 
fewer than 100 beds to those with more than 500 beds, 
physicians’ office laboratories, private laboratories, refer-
ence/independent laboratories, academic institutions, gov-
ernment, health systems, outpatient clinic laboratories, 
blood centers or blood banks, military/Veterans Affairs/
Veterans Health Administration, pathologists’ laborato-
ries, public health laboratories, industry, and retail labo-
ratories), most of them employed at hospitals. Of all the 
departments surveyed, the chemistry/toxicology depart-
ment employs the most medical laboratory personnel at 
34.38%, while the molecular pathology and cytogenetics 
department employs the least at 3.92%. By region, the 
South-Central Atlantic had the highest number of respon-
dents at 25.48%, and the Central Northwest had the least 
number of respondents at 10.11% ❚Figure 1❚. The top 10 
states with the most respondents were (in descending 
order) Texas, California, New York, Pennsylvania, 
Florida, Illinois, Michigan, North Carolina, Ohio, and 
Tennessee. One department was added in the latest ASCP 
Vacancy Survey—LIS/QA/PI, in addition to the 16 labo-
ratory areas surveyed in 2014.
Across the nation, the overall vacancy rate was 
highest for LIS/QA/PI department (10.98%) and lowest 
for anatomic pathology department (4.70%) ❚Figure 2❚. 
According to the survey results, LIS/QA/PI (11.68%) has 
the highest staff vacancy rate in the nation while ana-
tomic pathology (5.00%) has the lowest staff vacancy rate 
❚Figure 3❚. The highest supervisor vacancy rate occurred 
in the immunology department (10.39%), and the lowest

supervisor vacancy rate occurred in the send-outs depart-
ment (1.65%) ❚Figure 4❚.
According to the survey findings, the LIS/QA/PI 
department has the highest overall percentage (28.30%) 
of employees anticipated to retire in the next 5 years. 
Phlebotomy has the lowest rate of employees expected 
to retire in the next 5 years, at 10.76% ❚Figure 5❚. The 
staff retirement rate is highest in the LIS/QA/PI depart-
ment (24.76%) and lowest in the phlebotomy department 
(8.74%) ❚Figure 6❚. The supervisor retirement rate is high-
est in the cytogenetics department (47.69%) and lowest 
in the molecular biology/diagnostics/molecular pathology 
department (23.02%) ❚Figure 7❚.
Overall, survey results show that it takes less than 3 to 
6 months to fill positions in the departments surveyed. On 
average, hiring staff (nonsupervisory [for the purposes of 
this report, the term staff means nonsupervisory-level per-
sonnel]) for most departments takes 3 to 6 months, while 
hiring supervisors takes 3 months to a year. Phlebotomy, 
send-outs, and specimen processing departments take less 
than 3 months to fill for staff, while it takes 6 months to 
a year on average to hire a supervisor in the blood bank, 
core laboratory, cytology, flow cytometry, hematology/
coagulation, histology, immunology, LIS/QA/PI, and mi-
crobiology departments.
The Northeast region reported the highest over-
all vacancy rate compared with other regions (9.44%); 
the South-Central Atlantic had the lowest vacancy rate 
(6.31%) ❚Table 1❚. Taking vacancy rates of the five depart-
ments with the most respondents by region, data revealed 
that vacancy rates in the blood bank department are high-
est in the Northeast (13.23%) and lowest in the Central 
Southwest (6.29%). In the chemistry/toxicology depart-
ment, the Northeast (18.15%) has the highest vacancy 
rates, while the Central Northwest has the lowest (4.56%). 
The hematology/coagulation department has the highest

4). Results also reveal that 15.83% of all anatomic pa-
thology employees are expected to retire in the next 
5 years. Staff and supervisor retirement rates for ana-
tomic pathology are 11.00% and 30.25%, respectively 
(Figures 5, 6, and 7).
When hiring for the anatomic pathology department, 
most respondents report the preferred credential or certi-
fication are cytotechnologist (CT), histotechnician (HT), 
histotechnologist (HTL), medical laboratory scientist 
(MLS)/medical technologist (MT), medical laboratory 
technician (MLT), and pathologists’ assistant. In this 
 
survey, 57.60% of the respondents from the anatomic pa-
thology department indicated that they are required to hire 
certified individuals.
Within anatomic pathology, data show that 53.28% 
of staff and 79.42% supervisors are certified. Night, eve-
ning, weekend, and double shifts are most difficult to 
staff in the anatomic pathology department.

Blood Bank (Immunohematology)
The vacancy rate for the blood bank is 8.42% 
(Figure 2). Staff and supervisor vacancy rates are 8.99% 
and 4.62%, respectively (Figures 3 and 4). Survey respon-
dents working at blood banks indicated that they antici-
pate a 20.97% overall retirement rate in the next 5 years. 
Staff members have an anticipated retirement rate of 
17.58% compared with 33.73% for supervisors (Figures 
5, 6, and 7).
Respondents from blood banks prefer the follow-
ing certifications when hiring employees: technologist in 
blood banking, specialist in blood banking, MLS/ MT, 
and MLT. In this department, 74.30% of the respondents 
reported that certification is required of candidates for 
laboratory positions. According to the survey results, 
80.07% of staff and 79.05% of supervisors working in 
blood banks are certified. Night, evening, weekend, and 
double shifts are the most difficult to fill in the blood 
bank department.
Chemistry/Toxicology
The total vacancy rate for chemistry/toxicology is 
8.98% (Figure 2). The vacancy rate is 9.23% for staff and 
6.95% for supervisors (Figures 3 and 4). Results also re-
veal that 22.89% of chemistry/toxicology employees are ex-
pected to retire in the next 5 years. Retirement rate for staff 
is 18.45% and 44.47% for supervisors (Figures 5, 6, and 7).
Most of the respondents from the chemistry/toxi-
cology department prefer to hire employees with MLS/
MT, technologist in chemistry, and specialist in chemistry 
certifications. Also, 69.90% of the respondents indicated 
that certification is a prerequisite for all candidates for 
hire. Within chemistry/toxicology, data show that 73.86% 
of staff and 82.42% supervisors are certified. Night, 
weekend, and double shifts are most difficult to staff in this 
department.
Core Laboratory
Laboratory workflow models that include a core 
laboratory in the organizational structure have gained 
wide popularity in the past 20 years. Although specific 
test menus for core laboratories vary from facility to fa-
cility, those facilities generally handle hematology, chem-
istry, and, in many cases, microbiology. Core laboratories 
may serve one or more hospitals, physician offices, and 
nursing homes.
The vacancy rate for the core laboratory is 7.54% 
(Figure 2). The total vacancy rate for staff is 7.80%, and 
the supervisor vacancy rate is 5.64% (Figures 3 and 4).

LIS/AQ/PI
Introduced in early 1980s, LIS has constantly 
evolved over the years from a centralized automated re-
porting tool to an integrated informatics solution with 
multiple functionalities.1 The key functions include 
management of laboratory information, streamlining 
laboratory workflow, and integration with devices and 
manufacturing computer systems.2 QA is an ongoing, 
comprehensive way to analyze every aspect of an oper-
ation. In laboratory setting, it involves all steps of the 
testing process: preanalytical, analytical (testing), and 
postanalytical.3 PI is the process of continuous moni-
toring and improvement of quality of health services 
provided to the patients and others. Most performance 
improvement strategies are based on a plan-do-check-act 
cycle, a four-step model for carrying out change.4 This 
department was added because it has been a vital part of 
the laboratory field.
The vacancy rate for LIS/QA/PI is 10.98%, the 
highest vacancy rate out of all departments surveyed 
(Figure 2). The vacancy rate is 11.68% for staff posi-
tion, the highest for all departmental staff vacancy rates 
surveyed, and 8.55% for supervisors (Figures 3 and 4). 
Survey respondents from the LIS/QA/PI department in-
dicated that they anticipate a 28.30% overall retirement 
rate in the next 5 years, the highest overall retirement rates 
among all departments. Staff members have a retirement 
rate of 24.76%, the highest staff retirement rate among 
all departments surveyed; supervisor retirement rate is at 
38.54% (Figures 5, 6, and 7).
Most of the respondents from the LIS/QA/PI depart-
ment prefer to hire employees with MLT and MLS/MT 
certification. In this department, 56.70% of the respon-
dents reported that certification is required when hiring 
staff. Survey results show that 73.88% of staff and 87.06% 
of supervisors in the LIS/QA/PI department are certified. 
Night, evening, weekend, and double shifts are the most 
difficult to fill in this department.

ees are expected to retire in the next 5 years. The staff 
retirement rate is 17.05%; for supervisors, it is 32.83% 
(Figures 5, 6, and 7).
When hiring staff-level employees in the microbi-
ology department, most respondents report MLT, MLS/
MT, technologist in microbiology, or specialist in micro-
biology as the preferred credential or certification. Also, 
74.90% of the supervisors indicated that certification is a 
prerequisite for candidates for hire. Survey results show 
that 77.13% of staff and 90.57% of supervisors in the mi-
crobiology department are certified. Night and double 
shifts are the most difficult to staff in this department.

The vacancy rate for molecular biology/diagnostics/
molecular pathology is 5.32% (Figure 2). The vacancy 
rate for staff position is 5.88%; for supervisors, it is 1.85% 
(Figures 3 and 4). Survey respondents from the molecular 
biology/diagnostics/molecular pathology department in-
dicated that they anticipate a 14.68% retirement rate in 
the next 5 years. Staff members have a retirement rate 
of 12.51%, while supervisors are at 23.02%, the lowest 
among all departments surveyed (Figures 5, 6, and 7).
Most of the respondents from the molecular biology/
diagnostics/molecular pathology department prefer to 
hire employees with MLS/MT and technologist in mo-
lecular biology/molecular pathology certifications. Also, 
63.30% of the respondents from this department indi-
cated that certification is a prerequisite for candidates for 
hire. Survey results show that 78.78% of staff and 79.55% 
of supervisors in the molecular biology/diagnostics de-
partment are certified. Night shift is the most difficult to 
fill in this department.
Phlebotomy
The vacancy rate for phlebotomy is 8.11% (Figure 2). 
The vacancy rate for staff position is 8.49%; for super-
visors, it is 3.45% (Figures 3 and 4). Results show that 
10.76% of employees in phlebotomy are anticipated to re-
tire in the next 5 years, the lowest overall retirement rate 
among all departments. The staff retirement rate is 8.74%, 
the lowest staff retirement rate among all departments; 
the rate for supervisors is 27.80% (Figures 5, 6, and 7).
The certifications of choice for new staff-level employ-
ees in the phlebotomy department are CLA, medical 
assistant (MA), MLA, PBT, MLT, and MLS/MT. In this 
department, 29.6% of the survey participants indicated 
that certification is prerequisite for candidates for hire. 
Results show that 42.14% of staff and 68.12% of super-
visors (the highest rate of supervisors who are certified) 
in the phlebotomy department are certified. Double and 
night shifts are most difficult to staff in this department.
Point-of-Care
The total vacancy rate for point-of-care is 6.18% 
(Figure 2). The staff vacancy rate is 6.76%, and the super-
visor vacancy rate is 4.00% (Figures 3 and 4). Results also 
reveal that 24.72% of point-of-care department employ-
ees are expected to retire in the next 5 years. The staff 
retirement rate is 18.27%; for supervisors, it is 36.48% 
(Figures 5, 6, and 7).
When hiring staff-level employees in the point-of-
care department, most respondents report the preferred 
certification are PBT, MLT, and MLS/MT. Also, 63.20% 
of the supervisors indicated that certification is a prereq-
uisite for candidates for hire. Survey results show that 
77.99% of staff and 87.14% of supervisors in the point-
of-care department are certified. Evening, night, weekend, 
double overtime, and holiday shifts are the most difficult 
to staff in this department.
Send-outs
The total vacancy rate for send-outs is 6.58% 
(Figure 2). The staff vacancy rate is 7.30%. Of all the 
departments surveyed, this department has the lowest 
vacancy rates for supervisors at 1.65% (lowest among all 
departments surveyed) (Figures 3 and 4). Results also re-
veal that 18.23% of all send-outs employees are expected 
to retire in the next 5 years. Staff and supervisor retire-
ment rates for send-outs are 14.18% and 32.43%, respec-
tively (Figures 5, 6, and 7).
When hiring for the send-outs department, most 
respondents report clinical/CLA, MA, MLA, PBT, MLT, 
and MLS/MT as the preferred certifications or creden-
tials. In the survey, 35.40% of the respondents from the 
send-outs department indicated that they are required to 
hire certified individuals.
Within send-outs, data show that 56.70% of staff and 
79.82% of supervisors are certified. Night shift is the most 
difficult to staff in the send-outs department.
Specimen Processing
The vacancy rate for specimen processing is 9.11% 
(Figure 2). The staff vacancy rate is 9.69%; the rate for super-
visors is at 2.92% (Figures 3 and 4). Survey results show that

14.69% of personnel in specimen processing are expected to 
retire in the next 5 years. The staff retirement rate is 11.90%; 
for supervisors, it is 32.26% (Figures 5, 6, and 7).
Respondents from the specimen processing department 
prefer clinical/CLA, MA, MLA, PBT, MLT, and MLS/MT 
certifications when hiring staff-level employees. In this de-
partment, 24.20% of the survey participants indicated that 
certification is a prerequisite for candidates for hire, the low-
est rate among all departments surveyed (certification rates 
for this department are low in part because a certification 
exam for these personnel categories did not exist until 2016, 
when ASCP created its MLA exam). Survey results show 
that 34.82% of staff (lowest rate among departments sur-
veyed) and 68.75% of supervisors in the specimen processing 
department are certified. Double and night shifts are most 
difficult to staff in this department.
The Current Laboratory Workforce
Results of the 2016-2017 Vacancy Survey shows 
decreased vacancy rates for laboratory positions (except 
for cytogenetics, cytology, flow cytometry, hematology/
coagulation, point-of-care, and send-outs) across all 
departments surveyed compared with 20145 ❚Figure 9❚. Also 
mentioned earlier, hiring supervisors takes longer (between 
6 months and a year) for most departments, even longer 
than the previous survey results of 3 to 6 months. When 
asked about the main concern in the laboratory workforce, 
24.22% of respondents reported that it is staffing the 
 
laboratory with qualified laboratory  
professionals. They 
also indicated that the number of applicants is extremely 
low compared with the number of personnel retiring. But 
with the increasing workload in the laboratory (compared 
with the last survey, more respondents indicated having 
more than 1 million annual testing volume at their lab-
oratories), supervisors are compelled to hire lower level 
applicants immediately after graduation or those with 
bachelor’s degrees but not trained in a laboratory training 
program. Other concerns include low salaries (22.49%), 
nurses performing high-complexity testing (10.03%), and 
program closures (9.69%), to name a few.
Retirement rates (for those who anticipate retiring in 
the next 5 years) for laboratory professionals are also at 
their highest across the majority of the departments since 
2012 ❚Table 2❚. Moreover, the change (2016 vs 2014) in su-
pervisory retirement rates is higher compared with staff, 
especially in the anatomic pathology, chemistry toxicology, 
cytogenetics, cytology, flow cytometry, hematology coag-
ulation, immunology, microbiology, phlebotomy, point-
of-care, send-outs, and specimen departments ❚Table 3❚. 
Data suggest that these fields will soon be experiencing a 
drain in personnel who have been working for a long pe-
riod of time and have a vast amount of experience.
Previous vacancy surveys showed that laboratory 
professionals accepted shifts that were difficult to fill such 
as night, double, or weekend shifts for additional income. 
Current data show that these shifts, along with evening

shifts, are now once again difficult to fill. Data also show that 
95.70% (92.56% in 20145) of supervisors have not laid off 
any laboratory professionals in the departments they super-
vise within the past 6 months of participating in this survey. 
Furthermore, 88.23% (81.79% in 20145) do not anticipate 
laying off any laboratory professionals in the department 
they supervise in the next 6 months. The small percentage 
who have laid off staff, 11.77% (18.21% in 20145), suggests 
performance-based layoffs as the main reason (19.39%), fol-
lowed by budget constraints (10.91%), decreased workload 
and restructuring (9.09%), use of multidiscipline techs (with 
dual certifications [1.21%]), and other (3.64%).
According to survey participants, responsibilities of 
positions not filled in a certain amount of time are tem-
porarily assigned to other staff (49.81%; 40.40% in 20145), 
left open (45.00%; 34.03% in 20145), position reposted 
(27.97%; new category), or assigned to an agency per-
sonnel that is temporarily employed (14.98%; 8.40% in 
20145), eliminated (11.06%; 8.18% in 20145), or perma-
nently assigned to other staff (7.74%; 7.03% in 20145).
New Technologies
The percentage of participants who indicated that 
new technologies have caused changes to their staffing 
needs has remained steady (40.25% in 20145 vs 39.2% in 
2016). ASCP asked respondents to identify the types of 
technologies that are causing the greatest changes to their 
staffing needs. They reported automation to cause the 
greatest change (55.10%), followed by molecular testing 
(54.92%), LIS (36.31%), point-of-care (25.94%), and elec-
tronic medical records (19.14%).
According to the respondents, automation has increased 
the need for lower level staff to perform routine testing, 
leaving the technologists to focus on verifying and running 
tests. While more testing is done with less staff, turnaround 
time is affected by training staff how to use the instruments, 
leading many supervisors to actively seek well-educated, 
trained, and certified technologists. When asked about the

effects of point-of-care testing in staffing, respondents indi-
cated that increased point-of-care technologies are driving 
the need for more point-of-care staff. Demand for point-
of-care testing has dramatically increased the workload for 
laboratory staff due to oversight/regulatory compliance 
responsibilities as well as overseeing the nurses and testing 
personnel outside of the laboratory. Molecular testing con-
tinues to increase and, with it, the need for more specialized 
staff to perform them. Respondents report that new mo-
lecular tests are requiring additional trained and certified 
 
personnel. The use of LIS and electronic medical records 
will also require increased need for staff in the future that 
has expertise in software application management, infor-
matics, and interaction with other departments.
Hiring, Recruiting, and Retaining Laboratory Personnel
When hiring personnel, respondents reported that the top 
three difficulties they encounter are better pay and/or bene-
fits at other laboratories (48.31%), increasing competition for 
well-trained personnel (41.74%), and applicants do not possess 
necessary certification, education, and/or skills to perform the 
work (38.36%). In recruiting personnel for open positions in 
the laboratory, hiring managers indicated that their top chal-
lenges are better pay and/or benefits at other area laboratories 
(47.15%), increasing competition for well-trained personnel 
(41.90%), and applicants do not possess necessary education 
and skills to perform the work (37.26%). As for retaining staff, 
the top three issues include better pay and/or benefits at other 
area laboratories (39.36%), workload/stress (39.25%), and lim-
ited potential for advancement and additional compensation 
(37.42%). The perks offered to all laboratory personnel remain 
similar to the results of the 2014 survey and include health/
retirement benefits, bonuses and premium pay for nontradi-
tional work shifts, and continuing education reimbursements, 
to name a few. When hiring managers were asked how much 
budget is allocated on laboratory staff labor/personnel, they 
indicated that on average it is at 45.98%.
Feedback from the previous survey prompted the ASCP 
to include questions on voluntary and involuntary termi-
nations. Respondents indicate that on average, 55.14% of 
terminations have been voluntary. Reasons for leaving vol-
untarily include leaving for another position within the field 
(32.82%), relocation (25.12%), retirement (22.47%), leaving 
the field (10.63%), and higher salary (1.39%). Involuntary 
termination rate was not as large, at 14.15%.
The ASCP also asked the respondents if they hire for-
eign nationals under the H1B Visa Program and the type 
of the certifications they hire. Data show 18.4% do hire 
foreign nationals with preference toward the following 
certifications: CT (32.82%), diplomat in laboratory man-
agement (25.12%), qualification in cytometry (22.47%), 
and HTL (10.63%). The ASCP will continue to collect 
data on this question to analyze trends in the future.
Certification
Overall certification rates are highest among the core 
laboratory and hematology/coagulation departments, 
and lowest among phlebotomy and specimen process-
ing ❚Figure 10❚. Compared with the 20145 survey report,

certified ❚Table 4❚. Certification requirement rates went 
down 0% to 1% in the core laboratory, cytology, hema-
tology coagulation, and microbiology while phlebotomy, 
histology, and specimen processing went down 1% to 6%.
Data also reveal that 54.40% (56.51% in 20145) of the 
respondents reported that they hire noncertified personnel to 
perform the following responsibilities: preanalytic processes 
(81.16%; 84.10% in 20145), analytical testing of low com-
plexity (47.50%; 44.93% in 20145), analytical testing of mod-
erate complexity (32.53%; 30.65% in 20145), and analytical 
testing of high complexity (24.32%; 22.35% in 20145). While 
overall rates show that the rate of hiring noncertified per-
sonnel went down, the rate of noncertified staff performing 
low- to high-complexity testing had an uptick compared 
with 2014.
The education levels of all staff employed in the lab-
oratory that are not certified are as follows: high school/
GED (52.82%; 63.07% in 20145), associate’s degree 
(37.68%; 40.83% in 20145), bachelor’s degree (56.04%; 
52.75% in 20145), and advanced degree (14.33%; 10.55% 
in 20145). It appears that compared with 2014, supervi-
sors prefer noncertified laboratory personnel with higher 
levels of education if they are not certified.
Summary
Overall, the data show that vacancy rates are decreasing 
overall retirement rates and certification requirements are 
higher ❚Table 5❚. Results from the qualitative analyses also 
suggest that vacancies are being filled at a faster rate due 
to the increasing workload in the laboratory. Respondents 
indicate that the number of applicants trained in accred-
ited laboratory programs is relatively fixed. Thus, hiring 
managers are forced into hiring individuals who have not 
attended an accredited clinical laboratory training program 
and may have limited training. Respondents also voiced

concerns about competing with nurses for an open position. 
Compared with the 2014 Vacancy Survey, the percentage 
of staff employees who work locum tenens (temporary, 
part-time, per diem, and pro re nata) has decreased for most 
of the departments. However, for supervisors, there was a 
slight increase in the percentage of locum tenens employees 
(median percent change, 1.22). These factors appear to be 
the contributors to the lower vacancy rates.
In the previous survey, we mentioned that the field 
should start focusing on the qualifications and certifica-
tion status of laboratory professionals as these would be 
crucial factors in addressing the needs of the laboratory 
workforce. Results from this survey shows that that time 
is now. Data from this survey strongly suggest the crucial 
need in the supply of qualified and certified laboratory 
personnel. The uptick in the rate of noncertified individ-
uals performing low- to high-complexity tests, high reten-
tion rates, high retirement rates, and increased rate of staff 
taking on more responsibilities support this need. For 
supervisors in rural areas and small community hospitals, 
vacancies have been open for many months, leaving their 
laboratories with heavier workloads. As retirement rates 
continue to increase, the field needs to intensify its efforts 
on recruiting the next generation of laboratory person-
nel. This can be accomplished by enrolling more students 
in accredited training programs or getting more people 
involved in obtaining experience necessary to become 
certified. Retention of new graduates is critical, and the 
staffing needs of rural areas need to be highlighted.
