Oncolytic virus (OV) therapy is an emerging cancer treatment
that uses replicating viruses to infect and kill tumor cells and
incite anticancer immunity. While the approach shows
promise, it currently fails most patients, indicating strategies
to improve OV activity are needed. Developing these will
require greater understanding of OV biology, particularly in
the context of OV delivery and clearance, the infection process
within a complex tumor microenvironment, and the modula-
tion of anticancer immunity. To help achieve this, we have
established a technique for high-resolution 4D imaging of
OV-host interactions within intact tissues of live mice using
intravital microscopy (IVM). We show that oncolytic vesicular
stomatitis virus (VSV) directly labeled with Alexa Fluor dyes is
easily visualized by single- or multiphoton microscopy while
retaining bioactivity in vivo. The addition of fluorophore-
tagged antibodies and genetically encoded reporter proteins
to image target cells and the virus infection enables real-time
imaging of dynamic interactions between VSV and host cells
in blood, tumor, and visceral organs of live mice. The method
has sufficient in vivo resolution to observe leukocytes in blood
binding to and transporting VSV particles, foci of VSV
infection spreading through a tumor, and antigen-presenting
cells in the spleen interacting with and being infected by
VSV. Visualizing OV-host interactions by IVM represents a
powerful new tool for studying OV therapy.
INTRODUCTION
Oncolytic virus therapy (OVT) is an approach to treating cancer in
which patients are infused with live, replicating viruses that seek
out, infect, and kill tumor cells while simultaneously eliciting an im-
mune response toward the cancer.1,2 After decades of research and
development, the treatment has finally been validated in human
clinical trials. In 2015, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration
approved an engineered herpes simplex virus called Imlygic for treat-
ing metastatic melanoma,3 and wild-type reovirus and genetically
attenuated poliovirus have recently been granted orphan drug and
breakthrough therapy designation, respectively, for treating various
cancers.4,5 Numerous other OVs are currently being tested in phase
1, 2, and 3 clinical trials, as monotherapy or in combination with
conventional cancer drugs and other immunotherapies. It is widely
anticipated that additional OV and combination therapies will be
licensed for treating a variety of cancers in the coming decade.
Yet despite the recent approvals and ongoing excitement, OVT still
fails most patients.6–8 More effective OV strains, combination thera-
pies, and dosing regimens are required to maximize this drug class’s
potential. Developing these, however, will be predicated upon a
deeper understanding of the mechanisms governing success or failure
of OVT. Elucidating these mechanisms has been difficult, partly
because methods for studying the dynamic interactions between
OV and host cells in situ are lacking. For example, determining
how OV travels through the bloodstream and migrates across tumor
endothelia for delivery to cancer cells,9 and the barriers that impede it
from doing so, would benefit tremendously from a method that
enables real-time visualization of OV particles, leukocytes, and
stromal and cancer cells in the blood vessels and tumor microenvi-
ronment of live mice. Similarly, understanding how engineered
OVs boost anticancer T cell responses in secondary lymphoid
organs10 would be aided by in vivo imaging of virus-immune cell
interactions and infections in the spleen and tumor-draining lymph
nodes (LNs). So far, high-resolution visualization of OV-host interac-
tions in situ has been limited to snapshots in time provided by histo-
logical analyses.

 Intravital microscopy (IVM) is a powerful technique for studying dy-
namic cellular processes within intact tissues of live animals.11,12 IVM
uses confocal or multiphoton microscopes equipped with powerful
lasers to excite and visualize fluorescently labeled structures in situ.
The technique provides sub-micron resolution and has been increas-
ingly used to elucidate biological, pathological, and therapeutic mech-
anisms of action in mouse models. For example, our understanding of
organ function,13,14 cancer biology,15,16 and cellular therapies17,18 has
benefited tremendously from IVM studies in mice. Likewise, our
appreciation of virus-host interactions owes considerable resolution
to IVM.19,20 IVM studies have revealed critical insights into the path-
ogenesis of HIV,21 influenza,22 and West Nile,23 among other vi-
ruses,24,25 and the host’s immune response to virus infections.26 Being
increasingly accessible to modern day biomedical laboratories, IVM
represents a powerful tool for understanding how viruses naturally
infect host cells and are cleared by, or evade, the host’s immune
system.
To enable high-resolution studies of the dynamic interactions be-
tween OVs and host cells in vivo, we developed an IVM method for
simultaneous, real-time visualization of bioactive OV particles, cancer
and normal cells, and the OV infection in tumor-bearing mice. We
show that individual OVs, cellular infections, and host responses
can be imaged, tracked, and measured in blood, tumor, and visceral

organs of live mice using confocal and multi-
photon IVM. Preliminary studies revealed
interactions between OVs and intravascular
leukocytes, OV infection of mouse tumors,
and OV interactions with immune cells in the
spleen. While we developed our method to
visualize oncolytic
rhabdoviruses
(vesicular
stomatitis virus [VSV]DM51 and MarabaMG1),
the technique can easily be adapted to image
other OVs. Our method sets the stage for
comprehensive high-resolution studies of OV-host interactions in
their native therapeutic environment.
RESULTS
To develop an IVM method for studying OV-host interactions in vivo,
we first sought to identify an OV labeling strategy that would support
the visualization of individual virus particles without affecting their
bioactivity. Potential strategies included engineering fluorescently
tagged viruses (genetic approaches),27–29 growing viruses in cells
conditioned to transfer fluorescence (cell-assisted approaches),30
and directly labeling virus with fluorescent chemical dyes (direct-la-
beling approaches).31,32 Because (1) compact viruses often lose
structure and/or infectivity when genetically tagged with fluorescent
protein (FP),28,33 (2) most cell-assisted strategies only work for
enveloped viruses,34 and (3) many clinically advanced OVs are highly
compacted (e.g., VSV, Maraba, and poliovirus) or non-enveloped
(e.g., reovirus), we opted to test direct-labeling over genetic or cell-as-
sisted approaches for their ability to brightly and inertly label OV for
IVM imaging. Of amine-linked quantum dots (Qdots; Figure 1A),
amine-linked Alexa Fluor (AF; Alexa; Figure 1B), and lipophilic
FSL (Function-Spacer-Lipid)-fluorescein (Figure 1C) technologies,
each successfully labeled the outer surface of an oncolytic strain of
VSV (VSVDM51, hereafter referred to as VSV),35 a small enveloped
oncolytic rhabdovirus currently under pre-clinical development.

 While Qdot and FSL-fluorescein labeling significantly reduced VSV
infectivity in vitro, as measured by TCID50, AF technology had
minimal impact (Figures 1D–1F). All three strategies labeled VSV
with sufficient fluorescence signal to enable visualization within
superficial skin vessels of live animals using confocal IVM (Figures
1G and 1H).
Given their brightness of labeling and minimal impact on VSV
infectivity, AF dyes were selected for further optimization and ana-
lyses (Figure 2). Flow virometry confirmed that greater than 98% of
VSV particles were labeled by AF647 (VSV-AF647; Figures 2A–2F),
even at low dye concentrations. AF labeling conformed to a single
tight histogram peak, suggesting that single virus particles of rela-
tively uniform AF labeling were being detected (Figures 2D and
2E). Increasing the concentration of AF dye increased the mean
fluorescence intensity (MFI) of labeled virions (Figures 2E and
2G) without significantly impacting upon virus infectivity up to
100 mg/mL, with higher concentrations slightly impairing infectivity
(Figure 2H). Increasing the labeling time did not affect the percent-
age of labeled virions (Figure 2I), labeling brightness (Figure 2J), or
viral infectivity (Figure 2K). Collectively, these experiments indi-
cated to us that a labeling concentration of 30 mg/mL AF647 for
20 min provided an optimal balance between brightness of fluores-
cence signal and impact on viral infectivity. Indeed, this labeling
approach engendered no measurable effect on the virus’s life cycle
in vitro, as determined by single-step growth curve analyses (Fig-
ure 2L). Moreover, VSV-AF647 could be observed interacting
with and binding to live Vero cells in culture (Figure 2M), demon-
strating a dynamic association (Video S1) with the cell membrane
that has been previously reported.36
To determine if VSV could be visualized using other AF dyes, similar
experiments were performed using AF555 (Figure S1). Nearly iden-
tical labeling results were achieved with this fluorophore (Figures
S1A–S1H). VSV-AF555 could be easily visualized with confocal (Fig-
ure S1I; Video S2) and multiphoton imaging modalities (Figure S1J;
Video S2). Additionally, VSV-AF555 and VSV-AF647 could be
simultaneously visualized, and individually discerned, when injected
intravenously (i.v.) into the same animal (Figure S1K). Moreover,
particle size analyses using dynamic light scattering (DLS) identified
the majority of AF555-labeled VSV particles to have a mean diameter
of �200 nm (Figures S1L and S1M), consistent with the size of an
unlabeled VSV particle.37 We also tested the AF labeling and imaging
approach for other OVs, including another rhabdovirus (MarabaMG1,
hereafter referred to as Maraba)38,39 (Figure S2) and a non-enveloped
RNA virus (Reovirus)40 (Figure S3). Like VSV, Maraba could be
efficiently and brightly labeled with AF647 (Figures S2E–S2G) with
negligible impact on its infectivity in vitro (Figure S2H). Reovirus
could also be labeled with AF647 (Figures S3E–S3G). While a
significant drop in reovirus productivity was observed when using
high AF concentrations (Figure S3H), lower concentrations could
efficiently, and brightly, label reovirus without affecting its growth.
Both Maraba and reovirus could be easily visualized in skin vascula-
ture by confocal IVM (Figure S4).
The CT-26 mouse model system was then used to evaluate the impact
of AF labeling on virus bioactivity in vivo. This tumor system was
chosen because of its high responsiveness to OV therapy35,38 and
because it is grown in fully immunocompetent mice. Visualization
of VSV-delivered Firefly Luciferase (Fluc) by whole-body biolumines-
cence imaging revealed that treatment of CT-26 tumor-bearing mice
with either VSVFluc or VSVFluc-AF647 resulted in a similar infection
pattern of the tumor, axillary LN, and spleen at both 8 hr post-infec-
tion (hpi; Figure 3A, top row) and 24 hpi (Figure 3A, bottom row).
Consistent
with
this,
quantification
of
bioluminescent
signal
confirmed that AF647 labeling had no bearing on the VSV infection
in vivo (Figures 3B and 3C). AF647 labeling also had no impact on
VSV-mediated tumor regression (Figure 3D) and overall survival
(Figure 3E). IVM of red fluorescent protein (RFP)-expressing
CT-26 tumors demonstrated clear infection of CT-26 cells by
AF647-labeled VSV genetically encoding a GFP transgene (VSVGFP;
Figure 3F). Furthermore, fluorescence microscopy of ex vivo spleen
(Figure 3G) and LN (Figure 3H) tissues revealed widespread infection
of host cells by VSVGFP-AF647, including CD169+ macrophages
known to support infection of wild-type VSV.41 Collectively, these
data establish AF labeling as an effective strategy for multiplex
visualization of bioactive OV particles in live mice using IVM.
We next sought to determine whether IVM could effectively identify,
characterize, and track the interactions between OV and host cells in
situ. Because the primary goal of OV therapy is to deliver virus to
cancer cells for direct oncolysis,1,42 we began these experiments by
imaging for VSV within the tumor. Immediately following i.v. injec-
tion, VSV-AF647 was easily visualized in CT-26 tumor vessels (Fig-
ures 4A and 4B; Video S3). Strikingly, VSV was commonly observed
binding to, or being captured by, intravascular cells within the tumor,
often forming a halo of virions around unlabeled cells. The addition of
fluorescently
labeled
antibody
enabled
the
identification
of
OV-bound cells as CD45+ leukocytes (Figures 4C and 4D), many
of which expressed the monocyte marker CD11b (e.g., Figures 4H
and 4I; Video S4). Similarly, labeled Maraba virus and reovirus
were also commonly observed interacting with intravascular leuko-
cytes expressing monocyte (CD11b) or granulocyte (Ly6g) cell
surface markers (Figure S4). VSV particles were also found co-local-
ized with vascular endothelial cells (Figure S5). Time-lapse imaging
allowed for OV-cell interactions to be quantified over time, which
demonstrated VSV binding to intravascular leukocytes within the
first 7–8 min post-injection (Figures 4B and 4E).
To ensure the observed interactions were not due to AF647 conjuga-
tion, unlabeled VSV was injected i.v. followed by fluorescein isothio-
cyanate (FITC)-conjugated anti-VSV antibodies. This approach
demonstrated VSV binding to leukocytes irrespective of AF647
labeling (Figure 4F). Similarly, to ensure viral binding was not due
to an artifact associated with antibody-labeled cells, animal surgery,
or IVM, blood samples collected 5 min following i.v. delivery of
vehicle (PBS) or AF647-labeled VSV were analyzed by flow cytometry
to confirm the association of labeled VSV particles with peripheral
blood leukocytes (CD45+ cells; Figure 4G). These data demonstrate

(A–K) VSV was labeled with serial dilutions of AF647 using a fixed incubation time of 20 min (A–H) or with 30 mg/mL AF647 for variable incubation times (I–K). Labeled virions

percentage of events positive in AF647 channel (D) and fluorescence intensity (E). Values are reported as the percentage of labeled events (F and I) and mean fluorescence
intensity (G and J) ± SD (n = 3). The ability of labeled VSV to infect and replicate was measured in vitro and is reported as TCID50 (H and K). Values represent mean ± SD (n = 3);
*p < 0.05; ns, non-significant in comparison to unlabeled control. To further compare the effect of labeling on infection, Vero cells were infected with MOI = 1 by labeling
with 3 or 30 mg/mL AF647 or unlabeled control. (L) At 6, 12, and 24 hpi, supernatant was collected and titered by TCID50 assay. Values are reported as the mean ± SD (n = 3).

 that IVM has sufficient visual resolution to image OV-cell interac-
tions within the tumor. They also identify the capture of OV by intra-
vascular leukocytes as a common, early event in tumor vessels
following i.v. delivery.
Closer observation and tracking of labeled OV enabled the study of its
behavior when interacting with intravascular leukocytes (Figure 4H;
Video S5). Individual virions were found to be either loosely associ-
ated with leukocytes; randomly surfing across the cell surface with a
Brownian-like motion (Video S5, trajectory 1); or tightly associated
with the leukocytes, demonstrating limited movement along the cell
surface and appearing to vibrate back and forth in a single location
(Video S5, trajectory 2). Similar behaviors were observed by VSV
bound to endothelial cells (Video S5). These different viral behaviors
have previously been reported in vitro, and they are believed to reflect
either the non-specific association of virus with cells or the high-affin-
ity interactions between virions and specific cellular receptors.43,44

The leukocytes bound by virus also displayed
a range of behaviors, with some remaining sta-
tionary for long periods of time, sometimes
probing the local environment, while others
were seen crawling along the blood vessel wall
(Figure 4I; Video S6). Time-lapse imaging also
revealed the occasional transfer of VSV from
one leukocyte to another (Figure 4J; Video S7)
and growing foci of infection within the tumor from its earliest,
single-cell stage (Figure 4K). Collectively, these data demonstrate
the capacity of IVM to characterize OV dynamics and monitor
OV-host interactions, over time, within the tumor microenvironment
in live mice.
In addition to killing cancer cells directly, OVs can also boost anti-
cancer T cell responses by delivering tumor antigens to B cells and
dendritic cells (DCs) residing in the spleen, through a largely un-
defined
mechanism.45–48
We
therefore
sought
to
determine
whether IVM could be used to visualize and study OV-host inter-
actions in the spleen. Indeed, VSV could be observed binding to
and infecting various leukocyte populations in both red and white
pulp after i.v. injection (Figures 5A–5H). AF647-labeled VSV
could be seen interacting with marginal zone CD169+ metallo-
philic macrophages (Figure 5A), as well as B cells (Figure 5C),
DCs (Figure 5E), macrophages (Figure 5G), and neutrophils

 (Figure 5H) within the outer marginal zone and red pulp regions
of the spleen. Visualization of the GFP transgene showed VSV
infection of CD169+ macrophages, B cells, and DCs (Figures 5B,
5D, and 5F; Videos S8, S9, S10, and S11). Interestingly, we were
unable to detect infection of CD169neg macrophages or neutrophils
despite frequent interaction between these cells and VSV. Flow cy-
tometry analysis confirmed the virus-cell associations identified by
IVM (Figures 5I and 5J) and, at later time points, viral infection of
B cells and CD169+ macrophages (Figure 5K). Collectively, these
data show that IVM can be used to track OV-host interactions
in the spleen, both within the red pulp region and the follicle itself.
Visualizing additional tissues, IVM of the liver demonstrated viral
interaction with and capture by the resident macrophage popula-
tion, the Kupffer cell (Figures 5L and 5M; Video S12), and IVM
of the lung showed occasional capture of virions by leukocytes
within the lung vasculature (Figure 5N; Video S12). When taken
together, our data demonstrate the ability of IVM to track viral dy-
namics in various intact mouse organs and visualize OV-host in-
teractions in real time in vivo.
DISCUSSION
We describe here the development and validation of an IVM
technique that allows for simultaneous visualization of bioactive
OV particles and their interactions with, and infections of, host cells
in their natural, therapeutic environment. The technique offers two
main advantages over existing methods used to study OVT.
(1) Real-time, kinetic visualization in vivo. Our IVM technique
allows for monitoring of OV particles, host cells, and their
interactions and infections in real time throughout the course
of treatment in mouse models of cancer. Dynamic events can
be witnessed and studied, such as virus delivery to tumors and
secondary lymphoid organs via the bloodstream, virus binding
to and surfing upon cells, virus transfer between cells, the expres-
sion of viral genes or engineered transgenes within infected cells,
the host immune response to the virus infection, and the spread
of a virus infection throughout a tumor.
(2) Sensitivity and spatial resolution. Our IVM technique is suffi-
ciently sensitive to allow visualization of single virus particles
and individual cells within blood, tumor, and visceral organs of
live mice. This allows for the characterization and interrogation
of virus interactions (e.g., capture by leukocytes in tumor vessels),
virus behaviors (e.g., surfing on leukocyte membranes), and host
responses (e.g., leukocyte trafficking in infected tissues). More-
over, our IVM technique allows for high-resolution imaging
through all three spatial planes, which enables detailed 3D recon-
struction of cells and tissues. This adds significantly to the study
of OV-host interactions, for example, in the identification of in-
fected cells using morphology and relationship to tissue land-
marks to complement co-localization with molecular markers
(many of which lack specificity). For example, OV infection of
metallophilic macrophages in the spleen can be identified by a
combination of (1) macrophage morphology, (2) anatomical
location (surrounding a splenic follicle), and (3) expression of
surface antigen CD169.
An important consideration in the development of our technique was
the choice of fluorescent labeling strategies. Studying OV-host inter-
actions by IVM requires simultaneous visualization and discernment
of non-infected cells (cancer and normal), virally infected cells, and
individual bioactive OV particles. When developing our technique,
we drew from our own experience12,24 and published IVM studies19,49
of pathogenic virus-host interactions that used a combination of
genetically engineered FP reporters, fluorophore-conjugated anti-
bodies, and chemical dyes to label and track virus-cell contacts, be-
haviors, and infections in vivo. Each labeling approach has its unique
strengths and limitations, and the choices we made were guided by
factors such as specificity, sensitivity, innocuousness, flexibility, ease
of use, and cost. For example, genetic strategies were chosen for label-
ing cancer cells and viruses because, with a few exceptions, cell lines
and OVs can be easily and cost-effectively engineered to express a
wide range of FPs in a specific, bright, and generally innocuous
fashion. In contrast, genetic strategies for labeling normal cells and
small virus particles require conditional transgenic reporter mice
and chimeric virus-FP fusion proteins, respectively, which can be
difficult; expensive; time consuming; and, in the case of fusion

 proteins, generally attenuating on viral bioactivity.28,33 We therefore
opted for antibody- and chemical labeling approaches for visualizing
normal cells and virus particles, respectively. Antibody labeling offers
the advantage of ready commercial availability and easy, custom
conjugation with a wide range of fluorophores. Moreover, anti-
body-bound cells are bright and easily imaged by IVM, and multiple
antigens on the same or different cell types can be simultaneously
labeled and visualized. A major drawback, however, is that antibody
binding can sometimes affect the target cell’s biology, for example, by
blocking its normal interactions with other cells, causing spurious
interactions, or triggering intracellular signaling pathways. Efforts
must, therefore, be taken to confirm antibody-based findings using
complementary approaches, which we did using flow cytometry but
could also be done using transgenic reporter mice.
We chose chemical labeling to visualize OV particles, and indeed a
major objective of our study was the identification of the optimal
chemical dye. Three commercially available strategies were evaluated
with the following objectives in mind: (1) labels individual OV parti-
cles with a bright signal that is easily visualized by IVM; (2) does not
interfere with viral bioactivity; (3) numerous dyes available to ensure
compatibility with different imaging platforms, filter sets, and
multiplexing strategies; and (4) labeling is simple, reliable, and
compatible with both enveloped and non-enveloped viruses. Of the
strategies evaluated, only AF labeling met all four criteria. While
FSL-fluorescein labeled VSV for easy visualization in blood vessels,
it tended to reduce virus infectivity at increasing concentrations.
Moreover, it was not bright enough to discern single particles in
tissues with high background auto-fluorescence (i.e., liver and kidney;
data not shown), is only available as a single excitation-emission
spectra dye, and does not label non-enveloped virions. Likewise,
quantum dot labeling by carbodiimide-coupling reaction provided
bright fluorescence detection of single VSV particles in vivo, but it
dramatically reduced virus infectivity at all doses tested, likely because
of its large size. In contrast, AF labeling was bright and easily visual-
ized in vivo. It did not reduce OV bioactivity by any measures tested,
both in vitro and in vivo, although it did disrupt reovirus infectivity of
cultured cells at higher doses, possibly because reovirus is non-envel-
oped. AF efficiently labeled all OVs tested, was photostable, and is
available in a broad spectrum of colors suitable for both confocal
and multiphoton imaging, including those with excitation-emission
spectra very distinct from tissue auto-fluorescence. Collectively, these
results suggested to us that AF dyes were ideal for labeling virus par-
ticles for the study of OV-host interactions by IVM.
While our study was designed to develop and validate the IVM
method, several observations were made that may provide mecha-
nistic insight into OV biology. Most striking was that i.v. delivered
virus particles commonly interact with leukocytes in tumor blood
vessels in seemingly non-random and dynamic ways. For example,
VSV was frequently observed being captured by some, but not all,
monocytes within an imaged vessel. Because the VSV receptors
(low-density lipoprotein receptor [LDLR] and related family mem-
bers)50 are ubiquitously expressed on mouse cells (except for naive
T cells), this observation suggests that the mere presence of the
VSV receptor is not sufficient to mediate its capture from the blood-
stream. Indeed, it is well established that not all cell surface receptors
are capable of capturing particles under the shear stresses associated
with blood flow.51 Because VSV is known to be coated in complement
and natural immunoglobulin M (IgM) soon after encountering
serum,52 it may be that only specialized subpopulations of leukocytes
have the appropriate receptors to directly capture coated VSV from
the bloodstream, a possibility we are currently exploring.
We also noted several behaviors of cell-bound VSV not previously re-
ported in vivo. These ranged from relatively restricted movement on
the cell surface to considerable motion sometimes culminating in
co-localization/aggregation with other virions to the occasional trans-
fer from one leukocyte to another. While the significance of these
behaviors is not understood, their identification would be essentially
impossible in the absence of IVM and our ability to see virions in vivo
in real time. It has been reported that some leukocytes can facilitate
OV delivery to tumors. Indeed, CD11b+ cells have been reported to
carry oncolytic reovirus into the tumor microenvironment, even in
the face of a strong neutralizing antibody response.9 The predomi-
nance of VSV-leukocyte interactions in the minutes following virus
injection, followed hours later by tumor cell infection, is consistent
with a potential role for leukocytes in delivering VSV to cancer cells.
Another prominent observation was that of significant particle size
variation in vivo. This was not measured in vitro, using either flow cy-
tometry or dynamic light scattering. Observations of virion co-local-
ization on the cell surface (as discussed above) provide a potential
explanation for some particle size variation. However, large particles
were sometimes observed floating freely in the bloodstream, appar-
ently unbound by cells. While speculative, it may be that these parti-
cles represent immune complexes formed between VSV and antibody
and/or complement within mouse blood. This possibility and its po-
tential biological relevance is currently under investigation.
Finally, we show that IVM can be used to study the biodistribution,
pharmacokinetics, and pharmacodynamics of OV therapies in
visceral organs within the mouse. Previous studies have demonstrated
that immediately after i.v. VSV administration, the highest viral titers
are detected in the liver, spleen, blood, and lung.53 In contrast to the
liver, where VSV titers rise rapidly (in minutes) and then gradually
decrease, VSV titers in spleen continue to rise until 12 hpi, and virus
glycoprotein can be detected in splenic CD169+ macrophages and
DCs.41,53 Consistent with these reports, we found that labeled VSV
binds directly to F4/80+ (Kupffer) cells in the liver without infecting
them (as determined by GFP expression), whereas VSV binds to and
subsequently infects CD169+ macrophages, DCs, and B cells in the
spleen. Transient virus replication in CD169+ macrophage is crucial
for an effective immune response to VSV and overall animal sur-
vival.41 The role of DC and B cell infection is much less studied,
but presumably it also plays an important role in eliciting an efficient
anti-viral response. In addition, Bridle and colleagues46 recently
showed a critical role for B cells and DCs in boosting antigen-specific
Molecular Therapy: Oncolytics
22

 T cell responses in the spleen after vaccination with a rhabdovirus
vaccine. A previous study from the same group showed that B cells
loaded ex vivo with a VSV vaccine and adoptively transferred into
mice efficiently boosted antigen-specific T cell responses in the
spleen.54 The B cell appears, therefore, to be at an interesting position
within the OV immunotherapy paradigm, whereby it not only binds
and traffics virions throughout both the red and white pulp, poten-
tially delivering virus to DC for T cell priming, but also becomes
infected itself, possibly serving the direct role of antigen-presenting
cell (APC). Ongoing IVM studies to comprehensively map OV-host
interactions in the spleen should allow the precise mechanisms by
which OV vaccines boost anticancer T cell responses to be revealed.
There are several limitations that must be considered when using our
technique, some of which we are currently working toward address-
ing: (1) imaging depth is limited to �150 mm for confocal IVM
and �300–500 mm for multiphoton IVM, precluding visualization
of deeper regions within the tumor (e.g., hypoxic regions); (2) the
experiments are endpoint, with imaging duration being limited
to �4–6 hours; the availability of imaging window chambers, howev-
er, should allow for longer-term, kinetic imaging over days, an
approach we are currently exploring; and (3) strategies that further
limit the impact of labeling on virus biology would be advantageous
for the study of some viruses (i.e., reovirus) that have proven to be
more sensitive to the labeling approaches outlined in this study;
engineering viruses with small genetic tags, such as iLOV, UnaG, or
tetracysteine-tag,
is
one
possible
strategy
to
preserve
virus
functionality.
Overall, the IVM technique described opens new pathways for study-
ing the complex interactions between individual OVs and host cells in
the live, tumor-bearing animal. The method is straightforward and
could easily be adopted by other laboratories. Future studies using
IVM should aid in the interrogation of OV biology and the subse-
quent development of more effective OV strains, dosing regimens,
and combination therapies.

Viruses and Cells
VSVD51 (Indiana strain) engineered to express Fluc and GFP
(VSVD51-Fluc/GFP, referred to throughout as VSV, VSVFluc, or
VSVGFP) was originally generated by John Bell and kindly provided
by Dr. Xuiquing Lun (University of Calgary, Calgary, AB, Canada),
MarabaMG1 engineered to express GFP (MarabaGFP, referred to
throughout as Maraba) was kindly provided by Dr. David Stojdl
(CHEO Research Institute, Ottawa, ON, Canada), and Reovirus was
kindly provided by Dr. Don Morris (University of Calgary,
Calgary, AB, Canada). The VSV and Maraba viruses were propagated
in monolayer cultures of Vero cells, purified, and titered using stan-
dard protocols.55 Reovirus was propagated in monolayer cultures of
L929 cells, purified, and titered using plaque assay.
CT-26 (murine colon adenocarcinoma) cells stably expressing LacZ
were kindly provided by Dr. John Bell (University of Ottawa, Ottawa,
ON, Canada) and cultured in RPMI supplemented with 10% fetal calf
serum (FCS). Vero cells (CCL81) cells were purchased from the
American Type Culture Collection (ATCC, Manassas, VA) and
cultured in DMEM supplemented with 10% FCS. L929 cells were
kindly provided by Dr. Don Morris (University of Calgary) and
cultured in DMEM supplemented with 10% FCS. All cell lines
routinely tested negative for mycoplasma.
Virus Labeling
Qdot 655 ITK Carboxyl Quantum Dots was purchased from Invitro-
gen. 5 mL Qdots (0.8 or 8 mM prepared in PBS) was added to 45 mL
VSV (6 � 1010 plaque-forming units [PFU]/mL) for a final concentra-
tion of 80 or 800 nM and mixed well by stirring. 1-Ethyl-3-(3-dime-
thylaminopropyl) carbodiimide (EDAC, Invitrogen) was then used to
crosslink carboxyl groups of Qdots with viral primary amines. For
this, 50 mL freshly prepared EDAC stock solution (10 mg/mL) was

 added to the mixture of virus and Qdots, following incubation with
slow shaking for 1 hr at room temperature.
FSL-fluorescein was obtained from Sigma-Aldrich. 2 ml FSL-fluores-
cein (20 or 200 mg/mL prepared in PBS) was added to 18 mL VSV
(5 � 1010 PFU/mL) for final concentrations of 2 and 20 mg/mL. Virus
and FSL-fluorescein were in turn incubated for 1 hr at 37�C or
overnight at 4�C.
AF647 or AF555 succinimidyl esters (AF594SE, Molecular Probes,
Invitrogen) were reconstituted in DMSO. Five microliter serial dilu-
tions (10, 3, and 1 mg/mL and 300, 200, 100, 30, 20, and 10 mg/mL
prepared in PBS) were added to 45 mL VSV (5 � 1010 PFU/mL),
45 mL Maraba (1 � 1010 PFU/mL), or 45 mL reovirus (5 � 1010
PFU/mL) for final concentrations of 1,000, 300, 100, 30, 20, 10, 3,
2, and 1 mg/mL dye, while stirring gently. Virus and dye were incu-
bated 20, 40, or 120 min at room temperature, with gentle inversions
every 5–15 min.
For all three approaches, unbound dye was removed by transferring
the labeling mixture to Amicon Ultra-4 Centrifugal Filter Units
(100-kDa membrane; EMD Millipore) and washing twice in 1 mL
PBS by centrifugation (4,000 � g, 10 min, 4�C). Control virus samples
were incubated with PBS.
TCID50 Assay
Vero cells were seeded 104/well in 96-well plates and cultured in 10%
FCS DMEM until �90% confluence. VSV or Maraba was serially
diluted (log 10) in serum-free DMEM. Viral dilutions were added
to Vero cells and incubated for 1 hr. Infected cultures were washed
three times with warm PBS and cultured in fresh 10% FCS DMEM
at 37�C. GFP-positive cells were visualized 3 days later by fluores-
cence microscopy, and TCID50 was calculated using the Reed and
Muench method.56
Plaque Assay
L929 cells were seeded 5 � 105/well in 6-well plates, and 24 hr later
serial reovirus dilutions in serum-free DMEM were added and incu-
bated for 45 min at 4�C with gentle shaking every 15 min. Infected
cells were covered with DMEM (2 times with 10% FCS) and agar
(2%) and incubated for 3 days at 37�C. Cells were stained with 1%
Neutral Red Solution (Sigma), and virus titer was calculated by count-
ing the plaques.
Virus Growth Kinetics
Vero cells were seeded 2 � 105 per well in 24-well plates, and 24 hr
later they were infected with labeled or unlabeled virus (MOI = 1)
for 1 hr at 37�C, with gentle shaking every 15 min. Infected cells
were washed twice with warm PBS and grown in fresh media
(DMEM supplemented with 2% FCS). Virus-containing supernatants
were harvested at 6, 12, and 24 hpi and stored at �80�C until being
titered by plaque assay.
Flow Virometry and Cytometry
For flow virometry, virus samples were labeled in vitro, diluted 1:10 in
PBS, and analyzed immediately using an Attune Acoustic Focusing
Cytometer (Life Technologies). PBS was used to set the gating for
virus particles. MFI and percentage of labeled events were analyzed,
after doublet exclusion, using Attune Cytometer software.
For flow cytometry, blood was collected through cardiac puncture
into syringes containing 100 U heparin, and spleens were collected
from euthanized animals, placed in ice-cold PBS, and passed through
a 70-mm nylon mesh. Red blood cells were lysed using Ammonium-
Chloride-Potassium (ACK). Cells were washed 3 times in cold PBS,
blocked with anti-CD16/CD32 mAbs in flow cytometry wash buffer
(FWB; PBS, 2% FCS, and 5 mM EDTA) for 30 min at 4�C, and stained
with fluorophore-conjugated antibodies in FWB for 30 min at 4�C.
Cells were washed again 3 times in FWB and quantified using an
Attune Acoustic Focusing Cytometer (Life Technologies). Data
were analyzed using either FlowJo (Tree Star) or Attune Cytometer
software.
Dynamic Light Scattering
The diameter of virus particles was estimated using DLS (Malvern
Zetasizer Nano Series). Unlabeled or AF555-labeled VSV was diluted
in filtered ultrapure water (18.2 MU.cm) in a 1:20 ratio. DLS measure-
ments were performed in 3 cycles of 10 runs (10 s each) at 25�C.
Malvern DTS 5 software was used for data processing. Polydispersity
index, correlation function, and cumulant fit error values were
checked to ensure data quality. Particle sizes are reported as light-
scattering intensity averages.
Tumor Model and Evaluation of OV Efficacy
CT-26 tumors were established by injecting 1 � 106 cells (in 50 mL
PBS) subcutaneously into the right hind flank. When tumors
reached �25 mm2 (�10 days), mice were treated with labeled
(30 mg/mL) or unlabeled VSV (5 � 108 PFU; or PBS control) by
tail vein injection. At the indicated time points, mice were injected
intraperitoneally (i.p.) with 150 mg/kg firefly D-luciferin (Gold
Biotechnology) in PBS, and 10 min later they were imaged using an
IVIS system series 100 (Xenogen, Alameda, CA). Photon emission
values were calculated using Living Image version (v.)2.5 software
(Xenogen). Flank tumor diameters were measured every other day
using skin calipers, and mice were euthanized when tumors reached
100 mm2.
In Vitro Microscopy
Vero cells were seeded 2 � 105 in 30-mm dishes (Fluorodish) and
24 hr later treated with labeled VSV (10 mg/mL AF647, MOI = 50).
Real-time imaging of virus-cell interaction was performed using a Le-
ica SP8 inverted microscope (Leica Microsystems, Concord, ON,
Canada) immediately after dispensing virus into the dish.
IVM
The microscopes, surgical preparation for subcutaneous tumor imag-
ing, and intravital imaging were recently described in detail.12

 Microscopes
Spinning-disk confocal microscopy was performed using an Olympus
IX81 inverted microscope (Olympus, Center Valley, PA), equipped
with an Olympus focus drive and a motorized stage (Applied Scien-
tific Instrumentation, Eugene, OR). This microscope is fitted with
UPLANSAPO 10�/0.40 and UPLANSAPO 20�/0.70 objective lenses
and is mounted to an optical table (Newport, Irvine, CA) to minimize
vibration when imaging. This microscope is coupled to a confocal
light path (WaveFx; Quorum Technologies, Guelph, ON, Canada)
based on a modified Yokogawa CSU-10 head (Yokogawa Electric,
Tokyo, Japan). Each of 491-, 561-, and 642-nm excitation laser
wavelengths (Cobalt, Stockholm, Sweden) was sequentially controlled
and merged into a single optic cable using an LMM5 laser merge
module (Spectral Applied Research, Richmond Hill, ON, Canada).
Fluorescence was visualized through one of ET 525/50M (green
channel), FF 593/40 (red channel), or ET 700/75M (far red
channel) band pass emission filters (Semrock, Rochester, NY) and
detected with a 512 � 512-pixel back-thinned electron-multiplying
charge-coupled device (EMCCD) camera (C9100-13, Hamamatsu,
Bridgewater, NJ).
Resonant-scanning confocal and multiphoton microscopies were
performed using a Leica SP8 inverted microscope (Leica Microsys-
tems, Concord, ON, Canada), equipped with 405-, 488-, 552-, and
638-nm excitation lasers, 8-kHz tandem scan head, and spectral
detectors (conventional photomultiplier tubes [PMTs] and hybrid
detectors [HyDs]) for superficial imaging (up to 150 mm). This plat-
form is also equipped with a tunable multiphoton excitation laser
(700–1,040 nm; Newport, Irvine, CA) and external PMT detectors
(Leica) for imaging deeper inside tumors (up to 300–500 mm).
Surgical Preparations
Mice were anesthetized by intraperitoneal injection of 200 mg/kg
ketamine (Bayer Animal Health, Toronto, ON, Canada) and
10 mg/kg xylazine (Bimeda-MTC, Cambridge, ON, Canada), and
the tail vein was cannulated with polyethelene tubing (0.28 �
0.60 mm, InStech Laboratories, Plymouth Meeting, PA) for delivering
fluorescently labeled antibodies (5–10 mg) and maintaining the anes-
thetic. Body temperature was maintained using a heated stage.
Skin and tumor preparations were made as described.12 Briefly, a
midline incision along the spine was made and the skin reflected.
The thin connective tissue membrane overlaying the inside surface
of the skin was removed, and edges of this skin flap were secured us-
ing sutures to expose and stabilize the tumor/vessels for imaging.
Spleen preparations were made by making a 1-cm incision in the skin
and musculature at the left dorsal side of the animal and gently teth-
ering out the spleen using 3-0 sutures tied to its associated connective
tissue. The mouse was then laid on a stage with the spleen positioned
over a coverslip.
Liver preparations were made by making a midline incision followed
by a lateral incision along the costal margin to the midaxillary line,
which was performed to expose the liver. The mouse was placed in
a right lateral position, and the ligaments attaching the liver to the
diaphragm and the stomach were cut, allowing the liver to be exter-
nalized onto a glass coverslip on the inverted microscope stage.
Exposed abdominal tissues were covered with saline-soaked gauze
to prevent dehydration. The liver was draped with a saline soaked
tissue to avoid tissue dehydration and to help restrict movement of
the tissue on the slide.
For lung preparations, a tracheotomy was performed and mice were
mechanically ventilated at 150 breaths/min with 120 mL tidal volume
using Inspira ASV (Harvard Apparatus, Holliston, MA). Mice were
placed in the right lateral decubitus position, and the lung left lobe
was exposed through removal of the overlying skin, fat, and portions
of three to four anterior ribs. A thoracic suction window attached to a
micromanipulator on the microscope stage was then placed into po-
sition, and 20–25 mm Hg of suction was applied (Amvex) to gently
immobilize the lung.
In some experiments, following i.v. injection of virus and labeling
antibodies, the animal was euthanized and tissues removed (spleen
and LN). Tissues were then fixed for 10 min in 1% paraformaldehyde
(PFA), sectioned, and ex vivo imaging of these whole mounts was
performed.
Image Analysis
Still images were exported from the microscope acquisition software
as .tif images and imported directly into ImageJ for analysis of cell
number, associations, and behaviors. Display items were processed
using Photoshop (Adobe, San Jose, CA) to adjust the minimum
threshold values for each of the fluorescence channels. The same
threshold values were applied to images from all treatment groups
within a single experiment. Videos underwent contrast enhancement
for each fluorescence channel. Again, the same settings were applied
to the videos of all treatment groups within a given experiment.
Videos were exported as .avi files, and they were converted to an
appropriate format, size, resolution, and frame rate using Microsoft
Movie Maker (Microsoft Canada, Mississauga, ON, Canada).
Statistical Analysis
Statistical analyses were performed using unpaired Student’s t test,
ANOVA, and Kaplan-Meier log-rank assessment (GraphPad Prism
5.0). p < 0.05 was considered statistically significant.
