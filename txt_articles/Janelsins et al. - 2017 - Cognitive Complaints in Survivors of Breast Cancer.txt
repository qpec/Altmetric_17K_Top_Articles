Purpose
Cancer-related cognitive impairment is an important problem for patients with breast cancer, yet its
trajectory is not fully understood. Some previous cancer-related cognitive impairment research is
limited by heterogeneous populations, small samples, lack of prechemotherapy and longitudinal
assessments, use of normative data, and lack of generalizability. We addressed these limitations in
a large prospective, longitudinal, nationwide study.
Patients and Methods
Patients with breast cancer from community oncology clinics and age-matched noncancer controls
completed the Functional Assessment of Cancer Therapy-Cognitive Function (FACT-Cog) at preche-
motherapy and postchemotherapy and at a 6-month follow-up as an a priori exploratory aim. Longitudinal
models compared FACT-Cog scores between patients and controls at the three assessments and adjusted
for age, education, race, menopausal status, and baseline reading ability, anxiety, and depressive symp-
toms. A minimal clinically important difference cutoff determined percentages of impairment over time.
Results
Of patients, 581 patients with breast cancer (mean age, 53 years; 48% anthracycline-based regi-
mens) and 364 controls (mean age, 53 years) were assessed. Patients reported significantly greater
cognitive difficulties on the FACT-Cog total score and four subscales from prechemotherapy to
postchemotherapy compared with controls as well as from prechemotherapy to 6-month follow-up
(all P , .001). Increased baseline anxiety, depression, and decreased cognitive reserve were
significantly associated with lower FACT-Cog total scores. Treatment regimen, hormone, or radi-
ation therapy was not significantly associated with FACT-Cog total scores in patients from post-
chemotherapy to 6-month follow-up. Patients were more likely to report a clinically significant
decline in self-reported cognitive function than were controls from prechemotherapy to post-
chemotherapy (45.2% v 10.4%) and from prechemotherapy to 6-month follow-up (36.5% v 13.6%).
Conclusion
Patients with breast cancer who were treated in community oncology clinics report substantially
more cognitive difficulties up to 6 months after treatment with chemotherapy than do age-matched
noncancer controls.

INTRODUCTION
Cancer-related cognitive impairment (CRCI) is
an important and prevalent problem for survivors
of and patients with breast cancer and it includes
problems with memory, executive function, at-
tention, and processing speed.1 CRCI can be
related to disease, surgery, chemotherapy, radia-
tion, hormone therapy, and immunotherapy.2-5
CRCI negatively impacts quality of life (QOL).6-9
Although several studies have assessed CRCI in
cancer populations via objective neuropsychological
testing and self-report assessments, the majority of
these studies have relied on small sample sizes, in-
cluded heterogeneous disease and treatment groups,

Assessing the patient’s perspective is an important aspect of
CRCI, particularly because some neuropsychological tests cannot
detect CRCI complaints. Patient-reported outcomes (PROs) are
ideal because of the lack of practice effects and clinical adapt-
ability. The Functional Assessment of Cancer Therapy-Cognitive
Function (FACT-Cog)10,11 is a validated PRO that was created

Cognitive Function in Patients With BC Receiving Chemotherapy
 specifically to assess cognitive challenges identified by patients
with cancer.
By using the FACT-Cog in an a priori exploratory aim
analysis, we investigated the impact of cancer and chemotherapy
on perceived CRCI in female patients with breast cancer in the
largest prospective, longitudinal nationwide study in community
oncology clinics to date and compared results with age- and gender-
matched controls recruited and assessed at similar times to patients.
We hypothesized that self-reported cognitive difficulties, that
is, perceived cognitive impairment, assessed via FACT-Cog total
score, would be more prevalent among patients with breast cancer
than in a noncancer control group; that cognitive difficulties would
persist longitudinally for patients with breast cancer but not for
noncancer controls; and that factors including age, education, race,
menopausal status, and psychological symptoms at baseline would
be associated with persistent cognitive difficulties12-14 and that, by
adequately controlling for these variables, we would observe sig-
nificant and persistent cognitive complaints. We also hypothesized
that patients who received anthracyclines—thought to be cardiotoxic
and neurotoxic15-18—would lead to more cognitive complaints than
in those who received nonanthracycline regimens.
PATIENTS AND METHODS
Study Design
We conducted a nationwide, multicenter, prospective longitudinal
study that examined the impact of chemotherapy on cognitive function in
female patients with breast cancer who received chemotherapy at community
oncology clinics via the University of Rochester Cancer Center National
Cancer Institute Community Oncology Research Program (NCORP) Re-
search Base. We recruited an age-matched noncancer control group for
longitudinal comparisons with patients. Controls were obtained from the
same source population as the patients; the NCORP clinic from which the
patient was recruited was also responsible for recruiting the control within
2 months of accruing the patient. Controls could be family members or
friends of patients, or unrelated. NCORP is a unique collaboration between
researchers and community physicians to address research questions re-
garding patients treated in community-based health care systems.
Institutional review boards at the University of Rochester Cancer
Center NCORP Research Base and each of the 22 NCORP sites approved
the study before participants enrolled. Coordinators completed study-
specific training. Measures were completed at three assessments: within
7 days before chemotherapy (prechemotherapy baseline; assessment 1),
within 4 weeks after chemotherapy completion (postchemotherapy; as-
sessment 2), and 6 months after assessment 2 (6-month follow-up; as-
sessment 3). Controls completed study assessments within the same time
windows as patients. Once 367 patients and controls were recruited, we
recruited additional patients to specifically address questions regarding
chemotherapy regimen differences on cognitive function.
Study Participants
Patients with breast cancer must have a diagnosis of invasive breast
cancer (stage I to IIIC), be scheduled to begin a course of chemotherapy,
not be scheduled to receive concurrent radiation with chemotherapy, and
not have metastatic disease. Both patients and controls must: be chemo-
therapy na¨
ıve, have a life expectancy . 10 months, be able to speak English,
be age $ 21 years, not be currently hospitalized or have been hospitalized
within the last year for a psychiatric illness, not be diagnosed with a neu-
rodegenerative disease, not have any CNS disease, for example, a movement
disorder, and not be pregnant. Each noncancer control participant was
within 5 years of the age of the patient with breast cancer. All participants
provided informed consent before completing study requirements.

 Measures
Clinical and demographic information was collected by coordinators.
Treatment regimens for patients with breast cancer were dichotomized
into anthracycline-containing or non–anthracycline-containing regimens.
Participants self-identified their race and ethnicity. Perceived cognitive
function was assessed by using FACT-Cog, version 2, a well-validated
measure developed by Wagner and colleagues10 to address cognitive
complaints related to CRCI, and was completed at the clinic location.
FACT-Cog examines a wide range of self-reported cognitive functioning
domains, including perceived cognitive impairment (PCI), perceived
cognitive abilities (PCA), impact of cognitive impairment on QOL, and
cognitive impairment perceived by others, in addition to an overall
cognitive function score, which is the sum of the four subscales. Smaller
values on these scales imply greater cognitive difficulties. A 1/2 standard
deviation as a possible cutoff for a minimal clinically important difference
(MCID) has been identified for this measure.19 Reading ability—a proxy
for cognitive reserve—was assessed by the Wide Range Achievement Test,
4th Edition (WRAT-4) reading subscale.20 Anxiety was assessed with the
Spielberger State/Trait Anxiety Inventory State score (form Y-1).21 De-
pressive symptoms were captured via an item from the Multidimensional
Fatigue Symptom Inventory22 in which patients responded to the state-
ment “I feel depressed” using a scale that ranged from “not at all” to “very
much.”
Statistical Analyses
The overall goal of this study was to longitudinally assess cognitive
function in patients with breast cancer who received chemotherapy
compared with age-matched controls. This is an exploratory analysis of
a tertiary study aim that assessed longitudinal changes in cognitive
function by using the FACT-Cog. The primary and secondary study aims
were to assess cognitive function by objective cognitive measures. Those
analyses are still ongoing and they will be reported in a separate article. All
available data were used herein.
Descriptive analyses. For comparison of baseline characteristics for
patients and controls, t tests were used for continuous variables and x2 tests
were used for categorical variables.
Means and standard deviations were tabulated for all FACT-Cog total
scores and subscale scores at each assessment. Group comparisons of
change over time were assessed with Welch t tests and were expressed as
effect sizes. We calculated percentages of improvement, decline, or no
change on the basis of a 1/2 standard deviation MCID19 over time from
assessment 1 to assessment 2, assessment 2 to assessment 3, and assessment
1 to assessment 3. In our study, the MCID was a decrease of $ 13.8 points
in FACT-Cog using the standard deviation for controls at baseline.
Longitudinal analyses. We used linear mixed models to compare the
trajectories of FACT-Cog scores of patients versus controls over the three
assessments and adjusted for important baseline factors. The linear mixed
model fixed effects were time (assessments 1, 2, and 3 treated as nominal),
group (patient or control), group by time interaction, and adjustment
variables age, education (less than high school, high school/GED, college/
graduate), race (black, white, other), menopausal status, and pre-
chemotherapy cognitive reserve, anxiety, and depressive symptoms. Subject-
specific mean cognitive function score was the random effect and was in-
dependent of residual error. We also tested the impact of treatment regimen
(anthracycline or nonanthracycline), hormone therapy from assessment 2 to
assessment 3 and radiation treatment from assessment 2 to assessment 3 in
a separate model for patients only while adjusting for the same characteristics
as above. Maximum likelihood estimation was used for these models, sig-
nificance testing was based on F tests, and marginal adjusted means were
used to explore the trajectories. The marginal means for each time, split by
group, are listed in Appendix Table A1 (online only). All participants who
completed the baseline assessment were included in these longitudinal
analyses (intent to treat).
Missing data. x2 tests were used to assess whether significant dif-
ferences in dropout existed between groups. We used a logistic regression
model to identify any demographic characteristics that might lead to
dropout, and the only one found was a higher dropout rate for blacks
versus whites (P = .003). Hence, race was included in the above models.
Under the missing at random assumption, the linear mixed modeling
method will yield unbiased estimates and standard errors.23 Not being
able to rule out missing not at random (MNAR), however, we used
a pattern-mixture method24 to evaluate the sensitivity of our results to
MNAR, and they were robust across a number of extreme MNAR
situations.
Computations were performed by using R (version 3; The R
Foundation, Vienna, Austria) and SAS (SAS/STAT User’s Guide, Version
9.4; SAS Institute, Cary, NC) as appropriate. MNAR sensitivity analysis was
performed by using SAS PROCs MI and MIANALYZE. P = .05 was used to
assess statistical significance.
RESULTS
Baseline Characteristics
Of participants, 964 consented to the study. Of the 945
who were included for analysis, 505 patients with breast cancer
who received chemotherapy and 334 noncancer controls
provided data for all three assessments (Fig 1). After assessment
1, 6.7% of patients with breast cancer and 3.5% of controls
dropped out. The difference in dropout rate between groups
did not reach statistical significance. After assessment 2, 6.0%

difficulty, in FACT-Cog score after chemotherapy and 6 months after chemo-
therapy. Assessment 1 is prechemotherapy (0 months), assessment 2 is post-
chemotherapy (4.8 months), and assessment 3 is 6 months after assessment 2

 of patients with breast cancer and 4.6% of controls dropped
out, and this difference also was not statistically significant.
Groups were balanced on age, ethnicity, and marital status
(Table 1). Participants were fairly balanced on education, except
there were more high school–educated patients compared with
controls (P # .001). The population included 9% nonwhite par-
ticipants with more blacks in the breast cancer group than in the
noncancer control group (P = .017). Controls also had higher
WRAT-4 general reading ability scores (P , .001). Chronbach a
values for FACT-Cog were .95 and .93 at baseline for patients and
controls, respectively.
Before any chemotherapy, FACT-Cog scores were lower in
patients with breast cancer compared with controls (Fig 2; P , .001).
When adjusting for covariates, overall difference between the two
groups remained a trend in the same direction (P = .071), with
higher age (P = .009), black race (P = .034), lower WRAT-4
reading score, higher anxiety, and higher depressive symptoms
(all P , .001) predictive of lower FACT-Cog scores at baseline,
whereas education was not predictive (P = .809).
Longitudinal Changes in Cognitive Function From Pre- to
Postchemotherapy, Postchemotherapy to 6-Month
Follow-Up, and Prechemotherapy to 6-Month Follow-Up
Patients with breast cancer reported statistically significant
greater cognitive complaints represented by declines on the FACT-
Cog total score and subscale scores of PCI, PCA, impact of cog-
nitive impairment on QOL, and perceived cognitive impairment by
others from prechemotherapy to postchemotherapy over time and
compared with controls (all P , .001). Patients with breast cancer
declined on FACT-Cog scores and the scores of controls did not
change. The Cohen’s d effect sizes (ESs) for perceived cognitive
difficulty of the patients ranged from 0.23 to 0.62 for total score,
PCI, PCA, impact on QOL, and comments from others (Table 2).
Reported cognitive difficulties in patients with breast cancer im-
proved slightly from postchemotherapy to 6-months follow-up (a
median of 11.5 months from prechemotherapy), whereas corre-
sponding changes in mean scores of controls were small and did
not reach statistical significance. Domains that significantly im-
proved were total score (ES = 0.15; P , .001; Appendix Table A2,
online only), PCI (ES = 0.19; P , .001), and comments from

 others (ES = 0.14; P , .001). Whereas most cognitive domains
improved over time, all subscales and the total impairment score
remained significantly below baseline at 6 months postchemotherapy
(ES range = 0.18 to 0.38; Table 3). Mean control changes were small
and not statistically significant for any domain.
Prevalence of Clinically Meaningful Perceived Cognitive
Impairment Over Time
Patients with breast cancer had more clinically meaningful
and statistically significant perceived cognitive decline, that is, they
reported greater difficulty over time, in the FACT-Cog total score
than did controls from prechemotherapy to postchemotherapy
using a 1/2 standard deviation cutoff as previously reported.19 In
patients with breast cancer, 45.2% reported a perceived decline in
FACT-Cog scores compared with 10.4% of controls (P , .001; Fig
3). From postchemotherapy to 6-months follow-up, 18.4% of
patients with breast cancer reported clinically meaningful per-
ceived decline in FACT-Cog scores compared with 11.5% in
controls. From prechemotherapy to 6-months follow-up, which
represented almost 1 year later, 36.5% of patients with breast
cancer reported a decline in FACT-Cog scores compared with
13.6% of controls (P , .001).
Longitudinal Changes in Cognitive Function Controlling
for Covariates and Predictors of FACT-Cog Outcomes
When compared with controls—using linear mixed models,
controlling for important prechemotherapy characteristics—
patients with breast cancer, on average, reported greater declines on
all
FACT-Cog
domains
from
prechemotherapy
to
post-
chemotherapy (all P , .001), and scores significantly improved
from postchemotherapy to 6-month follow-up on FACT-Cog total
scores, PCI scale, and comments from others (all P , .001; Ap-
pendix Tables A1 and A3, online only). Important predictors of
overall perceived cognitive difficulties via FACT-Cog total score
included lower WRAT-4 reading score, higher anxiety, and higher

Cognitive Function in Patients With BC Receiving Chemotherapy
 blacks; P , .001), lower WRAT-4 reading score (P , .001), and
higher anxiety (P , .001). Higher anxiety and depression were
associated with impairments on the impact on QOL domain and
the comments from others domain (P , .001). Perimenopausal
status was associated with a lower QOL domain score (P = .025)
compared with premenopausal status. In a separate model for patients
with breast cancer only, no statistically significant differences in mean
FACT-Cog total scores between treatment regimens, radiation therapy,
or hormonal therapy were observed (all P . .50).
DISCUSSION
By using a well-validated measure of perceived cognitive function,
our results from the largest study to date show that self-reported
cognitive impairment, indicative of CRCI, is a substantial and
pervasive problem for patients with breast cancer who received
chemotherapy. The clinically and statistically significant self-
reported cognitive decline among patients with breast cancer
was 36.5% from prechemotherapy to 6 months after chemotherapy
completion (11.5 months from prechemotherapy); prevalence was
13.6% in controls assessed at the same times. Few large studies, if
any, have systematically used FACT-Cog to assess this aspect of
CRCI in patients who received chemotherapy in a well-controlled
longitudinal study design. Our focus on patients who were treated
in community oncology clinics is also novel and important.
Our findings are in agreement with similar studies. By using
a clinically relevant cutoff, our findings show a prevalence of
perceived cognitive impairment in patients with breast cancer that
is similar to that found in other studies using global deficit scores
from neuropsychological tests.25 Our study suggests that perceived
CRCI is a complex multifactorial problem for patients with breast
cancer and that it is likely that a combination of demographic,
medical, and psychological factors plays a role in predisposing
someone to CRCI. Before any chemotherapy, patients reported
lower FACT-Cog scores than did controls; however, we found this
effect was influenced by age, race, cognitive reserve, and higher
anxiety and depressive symptoms, as our results became a trend
after including these covariates. It is also not known what effect the
disease itself may have on CRCI, nor that of other symptoms, such
as fatigue, which may contribute to baseline function. Increased
baseline levels of anxiety and depressive symptoms, lower baseline
cognitive reserve, and perimenopausal or postmenopausal status
were predictive of perceived cognitive impairment and may rep-
resent mechanisms that could contribute to the development and
exacerbation of CRCI. Although distinct processes from CRCI,
managing anxiety and depression during chemotherapy may lessen
CRCI and its impact on QOL. One other study suggests that
cognitive reserve may be an important factor in conferring risk of
longer-term CRCI. Ahles et al26 found that age and pretreatment
cognitive reserve predicted longitudinal processing speed perfor-
mance in chemotherapy-treated patients with breast cancer. We
did not find a significant effect of education in our study, which
underscores the importance of cognitive reserve as opposed to
educational status on cognitive impairment.
Younger age and the black race were predictive of problems
with perceived cognitive abilities, in addition to anxiety and cog-
nitive reserve. It could be that younger adults are more aware of
problems with cognitive abilities than are older adults. Evidence
suggests that blacks are more likely to develop cognitive im-
pairments than whites, and further studies focused on CRCI in
blacks are warranted to discern contributing factors, for example,
comorbid conditions. Baseline anxiety and depression were the
only significant predictors of both QOL and comments from
others. It is possible that these factors are most important in
determining the overall impact of cognitive impairment on QOL
as well as how others, for example, caregivers, view the patient’s
cognitive function. Whereas research demonstrates that anthracy-
cline agents are more inflammatory27,28 and neurotoxic18 than
nonanthracyclines, our study shows patients being treated with
either regimen experience CRCI similarly. In addition, those who
received hormone therapies and/or radiation therapy after che-
motherapy did not experience CRCI statistically differently from
those who did not receive these modalities.

 A limitation of this research is that we do not know the longer-
term impact of CRCI assessed by FACT-Cog. We are currently
observing a small subset of these patients and controls for 2 years
post-treatment. This study is an exploratory aim analysis and we
are still analyzing the longitudinal objective neuropsychological
assessments (primary and secondary aims), which are to be re-
ported elsewhere. More research is needed to address moderating
and mediating effects of anxiety, depression, and other factors,
particularly depression as our measure was limited. Whereas our
results are generalizable, studies more that fully evaluate CRCI in
older and younger patients with cancer are warranted, as well as
investigation of minority populations.
Despite these limitations, there are multiple strengths to our
study. This is the largest study to date to longitudinally assess
perceived CRCI. This, to our knowledge, is the first nationwide
study and also the first to assess perceived CRCI in community
oncology clinic patients. We used a well-controlled study design
using age-matched controls that were observed for the same length
of time as patients with breast cancer to control for aging effects.
We used a longitudinal study design with a prechemotherapy
assessment and we also had adequate sample size to control for and
assess multiple covariates. FACT-Cog is a well-validated PRO that
encompasses many facets of CRCI; using FACT-Cog, we obtained
prevalence results similar to those of studies using objective cognitive
tests. Many studies have used this measure in a cross-sectional design.
Ours is one of the few to assess CRCI in a longitudinal fashion. We
have also expanded knowledge about the relationship between CRCI
and its impact on QOL and comments from others. We had excellent
retention, which reduced our chance of bias. Our results indicate
perceived CRCI is a substantial problem for breast cancer survivors.
