ABSTRACT
The first years of life are paramount in establishing our endogenous
gut microbiota, which is strongly affected by diet and has repeatedly been linked
with obesity. However, very few studies have addressed the influence of maternal
obesity on infant gut microbiota, which may occur either through vertically transmit-
ted microbes or through the dietary habits of the family. Additionally, very little is
known about the effect of diet during the complementary feeding period, which is
potentially important for gut microbiota development. Here, the gut microbiotas of
two different cohorts of infants, born either of a random sample of healthy mothers
(n � 114), or of obese mothers (n � 113), were profiled by 16S rRNA amplicon se-
quencing. Gut microbiota data were compared to breastfeeding patterns and de-
tailed individual dietary recordings to assess effects of the complementary diet. We
found that maternal obesity did not influence microbial diversity or specific taxon
abundances during the complementary feeding period. Across cohorts, breastfeed-
ing duration and composition of the complementary diet were found to be the ma-
jor determinants of gut microbiota development. In both cohorts, gut microbial
composition and alpha diversity were thus strongly affected by introduction of fam-
ily foods with high protein and fiber contents. Specifically, intake of meats, cheeses,
and Danish rye bread, rich in protein and fiber, were associated with increased alpha
diversity. Our results reveal that the transition from early infant feeding to family
foods is a major determinant for gut microbiota development.
IMPORTANCE
The potential influence of maternal obesity on infant gut microbiota
may occur either through vertically transmitted microbes or through the dietary
habits of the family. Recent studies have suggested that the heritability of obesity
may partly be caused by the transmission of “obesogenic” gut microbes. However,
the findings presented here suggest that maternal obesity per se does not affect the
overall composition of the gut microbiota and its development after introduction of
complementary foods. Rather, progression in complementary feeding is found to be
the major determinant for gut microbiota establishment. Expanding our understand-
ing of the influence of complementary diet on the development and establishment
of the gut microbiota will provide us with the knowledge to tailor a beneficial pro-
gression of our intestinal microbial community.

espite the temporal resilience and stability of the gut microbiota, long-term diet
(1) and major diet shifts (2) are known to affect the human gut microbiota. Infancy
and early childhood constitute a period in life in which the microbiota is characterized
by relatively low stability and high responsiveness toward influencing factors. During
this period, dietary factors have major implications for the establishment of the gut

 microbiota (3, 4). While many previous studies have focused on early infant diet (5, 6),
particularly breastfeeding and formula feeding, only a few have addressed the effects
of the complementary (solid-food) diet of infants in the period after 6 months of age
(7). As the gut microbial population is not fully established until the age of 3 to 5 years
(8, 9), it is important to understand how it is influenced by the transition from early
infant feeding to family foods during the complementary feeding period, which is
defined by the WHO as the period from 6 until 18 to 24 months of age (10). The
established adult gut microbiota has been linked with a range of metabolic, autoim-
mune, and allergic diseases (9). Specifically, the intestinal microbiome has repeatedly
been linked to obesity in animal models (11–15) as well as in human studies (16, 17).
By transplantation of fecal microbial communities from human twins discordant for
obesity into germfree mice, it has been shown that a greater increase in body mass and
adiposity occurs in mice transplanted with obese donor microbiota than with the
corresponding microbiota from the lean donor twin, suggesting the importance of gut
microbes over human genetics in the etiology of obesity (18). Indeed, children of obese
parents have a higher risk of developing obesity, and this is not explained solely by
human genetic predisposition. Since gut microbes can be transferred from mother to
infant during birth (19), an obesity-associated microbiota may be transferred from an
obese pregnant woman to her offspring. It is well documented that obese mothers on
average breastfeed for a shorter time than normal-weight mothers (20) and that
breastfeeding has a protective effect on obesity in offspring (21). Further, parental
obesity is associated with lower socio-economic status and specific dietary patterns (22)
that may affect the type of complementary diet introduced to the infant and thereby
the development of the gut microbiota (9), as well as contribute to future obesity risk
(23). Indeed, diet-microbiota interactions have been shown to be key players in the
development of obesity (18). Therefore, we compared the gut microbiota profiles of
two different cohorts of Danish infants at the ages of 9 and 18 months, designated
SKOT I (24) and SKOT II (25), respectively (SKOT is a Danish abbreviation for dietary
habits and well-being of young children). SKOT I includes infants from a random sample
of mothers (mean body mass index [BMI], 22.9 kg/m2), and SKOT II includes infants of
obese mothers (mean BMI, 35.1 kg/m2). To elucidate the impact of (i) maternal obesity
and (ii) dietary factors on infant gut microbiota development, associations between
specific features of the gut microbiota and dietary factors were investigated with a
focus on breastfeeding and complementary diet composition.
RESULTS
Gut microbiota development during the complementary feeding period is inde-
pendent of maternal obesity. To assess the impact of maternal obesity on gut
microbiota establishment in offspring, we sequenced the V3 region of 16S rRNA genes
from fecal samples of 227 individuals at both 9 and 18 months of age in the two SKOT
cohorts. These cohorts are different with respect to maternal obesity and generally
differ in terms of socio-economic status, C-section prevalence, and early infant feeding
but differ only slightly with respect to infant body composition measures (Table 1).
Between-sample diversity (beta diversity) of the gut microbiota in the two cohorts was
investigated by principal-coordinate analysis (PCoA) of the Bray-Curtis dissimilarity
indices and showed clustering according to age rather than cohort (Fig. 1A). Distances
to the group centroid for each point, as an estimate of beta diversity, illustrated no
differences between cohorts (Fig. 1A). However, greater beta diversity was observed at
9 months than at 18 months in both cohorts, in line with previous reports (26–28).
Levels of within-sample diversity (alpha diversity), as estimated by the Shannon index,
the number of observed genera, and Pielou’
s evenness index of the communities, were
not significantly different between the two cohorts at either 9 months or 18 months of
age (Fig. 1B). However, there was a significant increase in these alpha diversity
measures from 9 to 18 months in both cohorts. On a compositional level, the gut
microbiotas across time and cohorts were dominated by four phyla, Firmicutes (64.2%),
Actinobacteria (23.4%), Bacteroidetes (7.7%), and Proteobacteria (4.3%), while less than

 0.5% belonged to other phyla or were unclassified. On average, 98.3% of the commu-
nities belonged to 24 bacterial families (Fig. 2). Despite large interindividual variation,
average bacterial communities assessed at the phylum level as well as at the family
level at 9 months and 18 months were highly similar between SKOT I and II (Fig. 2).
Indeed, according to PCA of family-level composition, samples clustered according to
age rather than cohort and showed the relative contributions of bacterial families to the
variation in the data set (Fig. 3A). After correction for multiple testing, we found no
significant differences between cohorts with respect to relative abundances of bacterial
phyla, families, or genera at either 9 or 18 months, and no differences in the changes
occurring from 9 to 18 months between the two cohorts were identified (Fig. 3B). In

 ota development and identification of the main factors explaining variation in gut
microbiota.
Limited influence of C section, gestational age at birth, and prior use of
antibiotics. The mode of delivery (31), gestational age at birth (within a normal range
of full-term delivery) (32), and use of antibiotics (33) have all previously been shown to
impact the infant gut microbiota. In the SKOT cohorts, neither microbial community
compositions nor alpha diversity measures at 9 months were significantly different
between individuals born by C section and those born vaginally (see Table S2 in the
supplemental material). We did, however, note a decreased relative abundance of
Bacteroidaceae (P � 0.003, false-discovery-rate-corrected P values [q] � 0.072) in infants
born by C section in SKOT II (Table S2), in line with results of previous studies (27, 31,
34). Gestational age at birth was not associated with gut microbiota composition or
alpha diversity at 9 months (Table S3), and the use of antibiotics 2 weeks before the
sample was taken (current antibiotic use was an exclusion criterion) could not explain
the variation in gut microbial diversity at 9 or 18 months (Table S4). All infants in the
present study were delivered at full term (range, 37 to 42 weeks), C-section prevalence
was low in SKOT I (Table 1), and for only a few infants was the use of oral antibiotics
during the 2 weeks prior to sampling registered (10 individuals in total). Further, the
relative late sampling point (9 months of age) may explain discrepancies with prior
studies.

 Duration of exclusive breastfeeding, rather than age at introduction of
complementary feeding, is reflected in late-infancy gut microbiota. Danish
mothers are advised to exclusively breastfeed their infants until the age of approxi-
mately 6 months and to continue partial breastfeeding until the infant is about 1 year
old. It is additionally recommended to introduce complementary foods (apart from
infant formula) at about the age of 6 months but not before the age of 4 months (35).
As we have previously reported (25), infants in the SKOT I cohort were both exclusively
and partially breastfed significantly longer than infants in the SKOT II cohort. Addition-
ally, age at the introduction of complementary foods was significantly lower in SKOT II
than in SKOT I (Table 1). Despite the fact that no infants in either of the cohorts were
exclusively breastfed beyond the age of 6 months, the recorded duration of exclusive
breastfeeding was associated with the relative abundance of specific bacterial taxa at
the age of 9 months. This was most pronounced in SKOT I, possibly due to the longer
average duration of exclusive breastfeeding in this cohort (Fig. 4A and B). However,
differences in the effects of duration of exclusive breastfeeding on microbiota between
cohorts were modest and not large enough to evoke detectable significant differences
between the two cohorts at the age of 9 months (Fig. 1 to 3). In both cohorts, the
duration of exclusive breastfeeding was negatively correlated with Lachnospiraceae
(e.g., the genera Dorea, Coprococcus, Blautia, Pseudobutyrivibrio, and Roseburia) and
genera within Ruminococcaceae (e.g., Ruminococcus, Anaerotruncus, Oscillibacter, Clos-
tridium IV, and Butyricicoccus), encompassing species known to utilize plant-derived
complex carbohydrates and resistant starch introduced with solid foods (36). Also,
Erysipelotrichaceae, Peptostreptococcaceae, and Eubacteriaceae were negatively affected

 by the duration of exclusive breastfeeding (Fig. 4A). Positive correlations with exclusive
breastfeeding were observed in both cohorts for Bifidobacteriaceae (Bifidobacterium),
which are known to utilize the lactose and human milk oligosaccharides found in breast
milk (37), and Veillonellaceae (e.g., Veillonella and Megasphaera), known lactate utilizers
(38, 39). In addition, Pasteurellaceae (Haemophilus) abundances were positively corre-
lated with the duration of exclusive breastfeeding (Fig. 4A and B). Although not
significant in both cohorts, lactic acid bacteria (Lactobacillaceae, Enterococcaceae, Strep-
tococcaceae) and other bacteria known to be present in human milk, like Prevotella (40),
and on breast tissue, like Enterobacteriaceae (Escherichia and Klebsiella) (41), were
positively correlated with duration of exclusive breastfeeding (Fig. 4A and B). At the age
of 9 months, 97 infants (nSKOT I � 59, nSKOT II � 38) were still partially breastfed.
Additionally, the estimated average daily breast milk intake at the age of 9 months was
strongly correlated with gut microbiota composition and confirmed the associations
obtained for the duration of exclusive breastfeeding (see Table S5 in the supplemental
material). Consistently with our previous report (8), the effects of breastfeeding on
microbial composition were limited at 18 months (Table S6). Some infants are fed with
infant formula as a replacement or a supplement to breastfeeding for a period prior to
the introduction of complementary foods. However, age at the introduction of com-
plementary foods (range, 3 to 6 months) did not correlate with abundances of specific
bacterial families at 9 months (Table S7). Furthermore, alpha diversity measures at
9 months were negatively correlated with the duration of exclusive breastfeeding,
whereas age of introduction to complementary feeding was generally not correlated
with alpha diversity measures, although a weak negative association with observed

 genera at 9 months was observed (Fig. 4C). These results suggest that breastfeeding
duration, rather than the timing of introduction of complementary foods, is reflected in
gut microbiota composition during late infancy, as recently proposed in a study of gut
microbiome data from Swedish infants (27).
Composition of complementary diet during late infancy affects gut micro-
biota composition. A validated 7-day food registration was performed by the parents
when the infants were 9 months old (42). On the macronutrient level, no significant
differences in fat or carbohydrate intake were observed between the two cohorts;
however, protein intake was significantly higher (P � 0.0001, Student’
s t test) in SKOT
II, while SKOT I infants had a significantly higher (P � 0.016, Student’
s t test) fiber intake
(Fig. 5A). To capture the complete picture of the complementary diet of the infants in
both cohorts at 9 months of age, we previously (25) divided the complete dietary
recordings into 23 food groups (defined in Table 2). By PCA of the compiled SKOT I and
II subsets of data included in this study (n � 217), the previously defined (25) principal
components named family foods (PC1) and health-conscious food (PC2) were gener-
ated (Fig. 5B). The family foods component describes the transition from early infant
foods (with low loadings of breast milk, formula, and porridge) to foods introduced
during late infancy (with high loadings of meat, milk, cheese, animal fat, and rye bread).

 formed a cluster characterized by negative associations with fiber as well as protein
intake (Fig. 5D). The families Erysipelotrichaceae, Peptostreptococcaceae, Lachno-
spiraceae, Clostridiaceae, Sutterellaceae, and Ruminococcaceae formed a cluster posi-
tively associated with protein intake, while Eubacteriaceae, Pasteurellaceae, Prevotel-
laceae, Veillonellaceae, and Fusobacteriaceae were all positively associated with fiber
intake (Fig. 5D). In both cohorts, fiber intake was significantly positively correlated with
Pasteurellaceae abundance. Additionally, compiling of cohorts revealed that Pasteurel-
laceae correlated positively (q � 0.012) with health-conscious foods (Table S5). In both
of the independent cohorts, protein intake was significantly positively correlated with
Lachnospiraceae but significantly negatively correlated with Bifidobacteriaceae, proba-
bly reflecting the amount of complementary food in the infant’
s diet (Fig. 5D). Indeed,
the family food dietary pattern, reflecting progression of an infant’
s diet toward family
foods, was negatively associated with Bifidobacteriaceae abundance (Fig. 5E) but pos-
itively associated with Lachnospiraceae abundance (Fig. 5F). Further, family food cor-
related negatively (q � 0.019) with Enterococcaceae abundance and positively corre-
lated (q � 0.009) with Sutterellaceae abundance (Table S5). These results suggest that
the progression from early infant food to family foods with higher protein and fiber
contents is the major driver of gut microbial changes during late infancy.
Progression toward family foods increases the alpha diversity of the infant
gut microbiota. Next, we investigated how the complementary diet affected the gut
microbial alpha diversity. At the age of 9 months, protein and fiber intake was
significantly positively associated with the Shannon index, while fat intake was nega-
tively correlated with the Shannon index. No significant association was observed
between carbohydrate intake and the Shannon index (Fig. 6A to D). Both the dietary
pattern family food and to a lesser extent the dietary pattern health-conscious food
were significantly positively associated with the Shannon index (Fig. 6E and F). Similar
associations were observed between nutrient groups and the other alpha diversity
measures, namely, observed genera and Pielou’
s evenness index (Fig. S1 to 2), indicat-
ing that both microbial richness and evenness are affected by the complementary diet.

 These correlations reflect that foods with high loadings in the family food dietary
pattern (Fig. 5C), including cheese, meat, and rye bread, were positively associated with
alpha diversity, while breast milk consumption at the age of 9 months was negatively
correlated with alpha diversity (Table 2). After correction for multiple testing, the
remaining 19 food groups did not correlate significantly with alpha diversity (Table 2),
indicating that the progression of an infant’
s diet toward family foods, characterized by
the transition from breastfeeding to more nutritionally diverse family foods rich in fiber
and proteins, is the main driver of gut microbial alpha diversity development.
DISCUSSION
Elucidating the influence of dietary factors on the development of the gut microbiota
during early life is necessary in order to understand potential links between childhood
diet and microbiota-associated disease risks later in life. Indeed, the early life period is
considered a window of opportunity for microbial manipulation, due to the relatively
unstable configuration of the incompletely developed gut microbiota (9). This study
reveals that maternal obesity per se does not affect the development of the gut
microbiota during the complementary feeding period. Rather, the gradual process
leading to the establishment of a complex microbiota, which occurs during infancy and
early childhood, is connected primarily to the transition from breastfeeding to family-
like foods rich in fiber and protein and apparently independent of other potential
effects, such as lifestyle and genetic disposition related to maternal obesity. Until now,
only a few studies have investigated potential links between maternal obesity and
offspring microbiota (43, 44). Collado et al showed that levels of Staphylococcus and
Bacteroides were significantly higher in infants (aged 1 and 6 months) of overweight
mothers (BMI � 25) than in infants of normal-weight mothers, whereas levels of
Bifidobacterium spp. were lower (43). Galley et al. found higher alpha diversity and
lower beta diversity in children (aged 18 to 27 months) of obese mothers than in
children of nonobese mothers but primarily in a subgroup of individuals of higher
socio-economic status. These findings were not confirmed by the present study.
Previously reported evidence has revealed differences in gut microbiotas between lean
and obese individuals (16, 45); however, the infants/children in the present study were
not obese at the sampling points. Nonetheless, it is plausible that the relatively late
sampling point (9 months) used in this study explains the lack of observed differences
in the infants, since potential initial differences in maternally transferred gut microbes
may be overruled by the effect of breastfeeding and complementary diet by that age.
Regardless of this, we find it remarkable that the communities developed so similarly
in the two different cohorts (discordant for maternal obesity), which were indepen-
dently sampled and originated from infants of different socio-economic backgrounds
(Table 1). Despite differences between cohorts in breastfeeding duration and comple-
mentary feeding practices (Table 1), these differences did not cause significant differ-
ences in gut microbiotas between cohorts within the given sensitivity and taxonomic
resolution of our method. Importantly though, the high similarity between cohorts
enabled us to cross-validate associations. We observed that Lachnospiraceae, Rumino-
coccaceae, Eubacteriaceae, Rikenellaceae, and Sutterellaceae constitute the major bac-
terial families that increase in abundance from infancy to the toddler age (early
childhood) and vice versa for Bifidobacteriaceae, Actinomycetaceae, Veillonellaceae,
Enterobacteriaceae, Lactobacillaceae, Enterococcaceae, Clostridiales incertae sedis XI, Car-
nobacteriaceae, and Fusobacteriaceae, which is largely in agreement with previous
studies (27, 29, 30). In contrast to what was anticipated, we found limited effect of C
section and gestational age on gut microbiota, but this is probably explained by the
fact that our first point of sampling was not until the age of 9 months, at which time
such effects are likely to have been diluted by other influencing factors, including
breastfeeding and complementary feeding. The relative abundance of gut bacterial
taxa as well as alpha diversity measures at the age of 9 months was explained by
breastfeeding duration rather than by time of introduction to complementary (solid)
foods, in line with what was recently suggested by Bäckhed et al. (27). Specifically, we

 found Bifidobacterium, Veillonella, Megasphaera, Haemophilus, and members of lactic
acid bacteria and the Enterobacteriaceae to be positively affected by breastfeeding
duration, while the reverse was true for members of Lachnospiraceae and Ruminococ-
caceae, known to utilize complex carbohydrates (36). Further, at the age of 9 months,
the level of progression toward family foods, reflected in a higher consumption of meat,
cheese, and rye bread, rich in fiber and protein, was clearly associated with gut
microbiota composition and alpha diversity measures. Particularly, Lachnospiraceae
abundance increased with the amount of family foods in the diet, while the opposite
was found for Bifidobacteriaceae. This probably reflects the shift from breastfeeding
associated with Bifidobacteriaceae to late-infancy foods, resembling the food of the
family with higher fiber and protein content, which selects for species within the
Lachnospiraceae. The fact that Shannon diversity, richness, and evenness correlate with
the transition to family foods indicates both that the number of different microbes
increases and that their mutual distribution evens with the progression toward family
foods. This might be interpreted as a sign of increased gut microbial stability. In adults,
whey protein and meat were recently found to be positively correlated with gut
microbial alpha diversity (46), and a high fiber content (e.g., arabinoxylans) of rye bread
has been shown to increase butyrate concentration in feces (47) and plasma (48) and
may also contribute to an increased alpha diversity of the microbiota by overall
increasing the diverse group of bacterial butyrate producers (49). Consumption of both
protein and fiber increases during the complementary feeding period and might
therefore represent new energy sources for gut microbes at an infant age of 9 months.
This may result in selective advantages for specific microbes to establish in the gut,
which will increase alpha diversity.
Although we also investigated associations between anthropometrical data and gut
microbiota features, we found no significant correlations after correction for multiple
testing. This might be explained by the relative healthy conditions of infants included
in the SKOT cohorts. However, the body of recent evidence for a relationship between
early gut microbial diversity and metabolic, autoimmune, and allergic diseases (9)
emphasizes that our findings are relevant for elucidation of the relationship between
complementary diet, gut microbiota establishment, and disease risk. In summary, we
conclude that maternal obesity per se does not impact gut microbial changes during
late infancy and early childhood substantially. Rather, variation in late-infancy gut
microbiota is affected by breastfeeding, complementary diet, and the transition toward
family foods with high protein and fiber contents, such as meat, cheese, and rye bread.
An increased understanding of the influence of the complementary diet on the
development and establishment of the infant gut microbiota provides us with tools to
tailor a beneficial progression of our intestinal microbial consortium.
MATERIALS AND METHODS
SKOT cohorts. The present study used samples from the SKOT cohorts, in which 311 (SKOT I) and 184
(SKOT II) Danish children were followed for the first 3 years after birth, with the overall aim of
investigating relationships between early diet, growth development, and later disease risks, especially
obesity and metabolic syndrome. The study protocols were approved by the Committees on Biomedical
Research Ethics for the Capital Region of Denmark (H-KF-2007-0003 and H-3-2010-122). In SKOT I, infants
from a random sample of mothers were recruited, whereas in SKOT II, only infants of obese mothers
(BMI � 30 kg/m2) were recruited (25). Inclusion criteria in both cohorts were single birth and full-term
delivery, an absence of chronic illness, and an age of 9 months � 2 weeks at the first visit. Recruitment
of participants for SKOT I was done by postal invitations sent to 2,211 randomly selected mothers of
infants based on the National Civil Registration System (24). A positive response was obtained from 330
(15%), but 19 dropped out before the first examination; thus, 311 individuals were included in the cohort.
With exclusions of individuals with fecal samples taken at only one of the two time points (9 or
18 months of age), individuals using antibiotics, or individuals for which we had inappropriately stored
fecal samples (e.g., samples stored at room temperature, for which the storage time was �24 h, or that
defrosted before delivery to the university), a randomly selected subset of 114 samples was used in the
present study. In SKOT II, 184 infants of the invited 208 obese pregnant women participating in the TOP
(treatment of obese pregnant women) intervention study were recruited (50). Using the same exclusion
criteria for fecal samples that were used in SKOT I, a subset of 113 infants was included in this study.
Collection of data was carried out from 2007 to 2010 and from 2011 to 2014 for SKOT I and SKOT II,
respectively. Official Danish guidelines for infant feeding did not change during this period. Participants

 in both cohorts were examined at 9 months (�2 weeks), 18 months (�4 weeks), and 36 months
(�12 weeks) of age, and fecal samples and information on body composition, food questionnaires, and
background interviews were collected at these examinations during the study. Several studies, not
including microbiota assessments, have been published previously on these cohorts (24, 25). For SKOT
I, one paper reporting on the microbiota assessed by a qPCR-based approach (8) and one study reporting
on the relation between microbiota data from SKOT I and nondietary factors affecting gut microbiota and
prevalence of atopic symptoms (51) are available.
Anthropometry and body composition. Birth weight and length measurements were taken by
midwives and obtained from health records. Weight, length, waist circumference, and subscapularis
skinfold thickness measurements at 9 and 18 months were taken at the Department of Nutrition, Exercise
and Sports, University of Copenhagen, by trained research staff. Using a digital scale (at 9 months,
SartoriusIP 65 [Sartorius AG, Göttingen, Germany]; at 18 months, Lindeltronic 8000 [Samhall Lavi AB,
Kristianstad, Sweden]), weight was measured, without clothes, to the nearest 0.1 kg. Recumbent length
was a mean of three measurements carried out with a digital measuring board (Force Technology,
Brøndby, Denmark), which made readings to the nearest 0.01 cm. Skinfold thickness was measured to the
nearest 0.1 mm by a Harpenden skinfold caliper (Chasmors Ltd., London, United Kingdom), and we used
the mean of three measurements. Recumbent waist circumference was measured to the nearest
millimeter at the level of the umbilicus with a nonstretchable tape measure (Lasso; Child Growth
Foundation, London, United Kingdom). Weight, length, subscapularis skinfold thickness, and BMI were
converted to Z scores, with the World Health Organization growth standards used as a reference and with
the software program World Health Organization Anthro (52).
Food questionnaire. As described previously (25), the infant diet was recorded by parents at the age
of 9 months using validated 7-day food records (42). Portion sizes were estimated with household
measures and food photograph series and noted in a precoded food diary. All intakes of energy,
nutrients, and food items recorded in the precoded food record were calculated for each individual using
the software system GIES (version 1.000d; National Food Institute, Søborg, Denmark), a system developed
at the National Food Institute, Technical University of Denmark, and the Danish Food Composition
Databank (version 7; National Food Institute [http://www.Foodcomp.dk]). Quality control was carried out
by trained research staff before data were entered in the database. Possible over- and underreporters
were identified on the basis of the estimated daily energy requirement of 338 kJ/kg for both genders, an
average between the 6- and 12-month estimates and cutoff values of �46% (53). The food groups
(Table 2) were selected on the basis of nutritional knowledge in an attempt to cover most aspects of the
official recommendations, nutrition evidence, and typical infant diet in Denmark. Food groups were
named with a short, compressed description, such as “RyeBread”and “SugaryDrink.”Intake of breast milk
was calculated as the number of breastfeedings per day, using a rough estimate of 99 g per feeding (54).
The intake (grams/day) of all food groups was divided by total body weight (in kilograms) for each
participant.
Information extracted from parental background interviews. Information on sex, socio-
economics (work situation, education level, and household income), prevalence of C section, gestational
age at birth, prior use of antibiotics and other medication, durations of exclusive and total breastfeeding,
and age of introduction to complementary feeding (Table 1 and see Tables S2 to S4, S6, and S7 in the
supplemental material) were collected from background interviews with parents at the 9- and 18-month
visits. Use of antibiotics was recorded 14 days prior to the 9- and 18-month visits. Exclusive breastfeeding
was defined as receiving only breast milk, water, and vitamins.
Fecal samples, DNA extraction, and PCR amplification of the V3 region of the 16S rRNA gene.
Fecal samples obtained at 9 and 18 months of age were freshly delivered on the morning of visitation
or had been stored in the participant’
s home, in provided freezer containers, either in the freezer (�18°
C)
or in the refrigerator (4°
C) for maximally 24 h before delivery to the University of Copenhagen’
s
Department of Nutrition, Exercise and Sports, where they were stored at �80°
C until DNA extraction.
Samples were randomized across cohorts (nSKOT I � 10, nSKOT II � 10) for each DNA extraction round
(ntotal � 20). DNA was extracted (12855-100 PowerLyzer PowerSoil DNA isolation kit; Mo Bio) from
250 mg feces according to the protocol provided by the manufacturer with minor modifications: bead
beating was performed at 30 cycles/s for 10 min (Retsch MM 300 mixer mill), and the initial centrifugation
steps were performed at 10,000 � g for 3 min, as recommended for clay matter. DNA quantity and
quality were measured by the Qubit double-stranded-DNA (dsDNA) BR assay (Invitrogen; Q32850) and
with a NanoDrop 1000 (Thermo Scientific), respectively, yielding on average 32.7 � 21.4 ng/�l DNA with
an A260/A280 equal to 1.81 � 0.12 and an A260/A230 equal to 1.60 � 0.39. The PCR amplification of the V3
region of the 16S rRNA gene was performed with 5 ng community DNA as the template, using 0.2 �l
Phusion high-fidelity (HF) DNA polymerase (Fisher Scientific; F-553L), 4 �l HF buffer, 0.4 �l deoxynucleo-
side triphosphate (dNTP) (10 mM of each base), 1 �M forward primer (PBU [primer bacterial universal]
5=-A-adapter-TCAG-barcode-CCTACGGGAGGCAGCAG-3=) and 1 �M reverse primer (PBR [primer bacterial
reverse] 5=-trp1-adapter-ATTACCGCGGCTGCTGG-3=) in a 20-�l total reaction volume. Both primers
include sequencing adaptors, and the forward primer additionally includes a unique 10- to 12-bp
barcode (IonXpress barcode adapters). The PCR program included 30 s at 98°
C, 24 cycles of 15 s at 98°
C
and 30 s at 72°
C, and then 5 min at 72°
C. The PCR product was purified by use of HighPrep PCR magnetic
beads (MagBio; AC-60005) with the 96-well magnet stand (MagBio; MyMag 96), according to the
prescribed procedure. DNA quantity was measured using the Qubit dsDNA HS assay (Invitrogen;
Q32851), and samples were pooled to obtain equimolar libraries containing up to 90 samples (random-
ized across cohorts and age) in each library.

 DNA sequencing and data handling. Sequencing of the 16S rRNA gene libraries was performed
using the Ion OneTouch and Ion personal genome machine (PGM) systems with an Ion 318 chip kit,
generating 5 to 7 million reads per chip with a median length of 180 bp. Sequencing data were imported
into CLC Genomic Workbench (version 7.0.3, CLC bio; Qiagen, Aarhus, Denmark), reads were quality
controlled, demultiplexed, and trimmed to remove low-quality sequences (Pbase-calling error � 0.05),
ambiguous nucleotides (maximum of 2 allowed), primers, and barcodes and to discard reads below
110 bp and above 180 bp. The sorted and trimmed FASTA files were run through the Ribosomal
Database Project classifier (55), with a bootstrap cutoff of 50% as recommended for sequences shorter
than 250 bp (56). Chimera removal was not performed, since short amplicon length and a low number
of PCR cycles reduces chimera prevalence (57). The total number of reads for each sample was on
average 47,544 � 18,656 (range, 12,749 to 121,070) and was used to calculate the relative abundances
of bacterial taxons at the phylum (99.8% classified), family (98.3% classified), and genus (75.2% classified)
levels. In the further analysis, a cutoff of 0.01% in mean relative abundance at either 9 or 18 months was
set. Based on the detection limit (1 read), a threshold was set to 0.001% (~0.48 reads) and samples with
zero reads for a given bacterial taxon were assigned this value. Based on reads assigned to the genus
level (average, 36,012 � 16,221; range, 4,384 to 92,980), 8 samples were excluded due to low depth
(�10,000 reads) for calculation of alpha and beta diversity measures. In the remaining 446 samples,
sequences were rarefied (average of 100 subsamplings) to 10,000 reads/sample. Binary Bray-Curtis
dissimilarity and alpha diversity measures (Shannon index, number of observed genera, and Pielou’
s
evenness index) were calculated for each individual in each cohort at the ages of 9 and 18 months using
the R package vegan. Based on principal-coordinate analysis (PCoA) of Bray-Curtis dissimilarities, the
distances to group centroids were used as measures of beta diversity, using the function betadisper
within vegan.
Statistical tests and correlations. Correlation analyses and statistical tests were done with the
GraphPad Prism software (version 5.0.3; GraphPad Software Inc., La Jolla, CA) and R (version 3.1.0, R Core
Team 2014 R:A language and environment for statistical computing; R Foundation for Statistical
Computing, Vienna, Austria). Principal-component/coordinate analyses (prcomp/betadisper) and heat-
maps (heatmap.2) were performed in R using the packages ggbiplot, gplot, and vegan. Normal distri-
bution of data was evaluated by the Shapiro-Wilk normality test and visual inspection of histograms.
Cohort characteristics were compared by Fisher’
s exact test/chi-square test for categorical data and an
unpaired t test or the Mann-Whitney test for continuous data. A paired Wilcoxon signed-rank test or
paired t test was used to examine the changes in alpha diversity measures and bacterial composition
across time, whereas the Mann-Whitney test or unpaired t test was used to compare measures of alpha
diversity and bacterial composition between cohorts at the ages of 9 and 18 months. Turkey’
s honestly
significant differences test was used to evaluate differences in beta diversity across time and cohorts.
Spearman’
s rank test/Pearson’
s correlations and the unpaired t test/Mann-Whitney test were used to
investigate associations between gut bacterial composition and alpha diversity measures with birth
mode, gestational age at birth, prior use of antibiotics, duration of exclusive/total breastfeeding, age at
introduction to complementary feeding, complementary diet at 9 months, and anthropometrics at 9 and
18 months. When indicated, false discovery rate-corrected (58) P values (q values) were applied to correct
for multiple testing, with a threshold of 0.05.
