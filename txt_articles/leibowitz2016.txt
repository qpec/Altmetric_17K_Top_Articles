IMPORTANCE International guidelines recommend treatment with statins for patients with
preexisting ischemic heart disease to prevent additional cardiovascular events but differ
regarding target levels of low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C). Trial data on this
question are inconclusive and observational data are lacking.
OBJECTIVE To assess the relationship between levels of LDL-C achieved with statin treatment
and cardiovascular events in adherent patients with preexisting ischemic heart disease.
DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS Population-based observational cohort study from
2009 to 2013 using data from a health care organization in Israel covering more than 4.3
million members. Included patients had ischemic heart disease, were aged 30 to 84 years,
were treated with statins, and were at least 80% adherent to treatment or, in a sensitivity
analysis, at least 50% adherent. Patients with active cancer or metabolic abnormalities were
excluded.
EXPOSURES Index LDL-C was defined as the first achieved serum LDL-C measure after at
least 1 year of statin treatment, grouped as low (�70.0 mg/dL), moderate (70.1-
100.0 mg/dL), or high (100.1-130.0 mg/dL).
MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES Major adverse cardiac events included acute myocardial
infarction, unstable angina, stroke, angioplasty, bypass surgery, or all-cause mortality. The
hazard ratio of adverse outcomes was estimated using 2 Cox proportional hazards models
with low vs moderate and moderate vs high LDL-C, adjusted for confounders and further
tested using propensity score matching analysis.
RESULTS The cohort with at least 80% adherence included 31 619 patients, for whom the
mean (SD) age was 67.3 (9.8) years. Of this population, 27% were female and 29% had low,
53% moderate, and 18% high LDL-C when taking statin treatment. Overall, there were 9035
patients who had an adverse outcome during a mean 1.6 years of follow-up (6.7 per 1000
persons per year). The adjusted incidence of adverse outcomes was not different between
low and moderate LDL-C (hazard ratio [HR], 1.02; 95% CI, 0.97-1.07; P = .54), but it was lower
with moderate vs high LDL-C (HR, 0.89; 95% CI, 0.84-0.94; P < .001). Among 54 884
patients with at least 50% statin adherence, the adjusted HR was 1.06 (95% CI, 1.02-1.10;
P = .001) in the low vs moderate groups and 0.87 (95% CI, 0.84-0.91; P = .001) in the
moderate vs high groups.
CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE Patients with LDL-C levels of 70 to 100 mg/dL taking statins
had lower risk of adverse cardiac outcomes compared with those with LDL-C levels between
100 and 130 mg/dL, but no additional benefit was gained by achieving LDL-C of 70 mg/dL or
less. These population-based data do not support treatment guidelines recommending very
low target LDL-C levels for all patients with preexisting heart disease.

P
atients with stable ischemic heart disease (IHD) are at
increased risk for recurrent cardiovascular events, and
clinicalpracticeguidelinesrecommendlong-termtreat-
ment with statins. There are, however, differences among cur-
rent guidelines regarding the definition of appropriate tar-
gets for low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C) levels. The
American Heart Association’
s guidelines define treatment by
medication intensity and do not establish target LDL-C levels,1
whereas the European Society of Cardiology recommends that
treatmentbetitratedtoachieveanLDL-Clevelbelow70mg/dL
(to convert milligrams per deciliter to millimoles per liter, mul-
tiply by 0.0259).2
The major study cited in guidelines as evidence for achiev-
ing low LDL-C levels is a meta-analysis of randomized clinical
trials(RCTs)demonstratingareductionincardiovascularevents

significantfindingsofimprovedefficacyatlowerLDL-Clevels.6,7
Results from recent clinical trials of statins in combina-
tion with adjunctive medications for secondary prevention8-10
have led to renewed emphasis on the concept that “lower is
better” for target LDL-C levels.11 The question of the associa-
tion between achieved LDL-C levels and major adverse car-
diac events (MACEs) for secondary prevention has become
highly relevant, particularly in the real-world context of pa-
tients excluded from RCTs. The present population-based ob-
servational study examines whether the principle of lower is
betterisapplicabletolong-termtreatmentofpatientswithIHD
in the community setting, by assessing the relationship be-
tween observed LDL-C levels and cardiovascular outcomes in
the largest health care organization in Israel.
Methods
Study Design
ThisobservationalcohortstudycomparesriskofMACEsamong
IHD patient subgroups by observed LDL-C levels after at least
1 year of statin therapy.
Data Source
Data for all Clalit Health Services (CHS) members were col-
lected for this study from CHS’
s comprehensive clinical and
administrative data warehouse. Anonymous patient data were
compiled from electronic medical records, the organization’
s
chronic disease registry, hospital discharge summaries, and
pharmacy and laboratory records. Patients’demographic data
were collected from the Israeli Central Bureau of Statistics and
the Ministry of Internal Affairs. The CHS institutional review
board waived the requirement for patient consent because of
the retrospective nature of the study and approved this study.
Study Cohort
The cohort included patients aged 30 to 84 years with preex-
isting IHD, defined as a previous acute diagnosis requiring
secondary prevention including myocardial infarction,
unstable angina, percutaneous transluminal coronary angio-
plasty (PTCA), or coronary artery bypass grafting before the
index date. Cohort entry was the date of the first serum LDL-C
value any time from January 1, 2009, to December 31, 2013,
that was preceded by at least 1 year of adherence to statin
therapy. Adherence to statin therapy was derived from a
prescription-based medication possession ratio and was
defined as fulfillment of at least 80% of statin prescriptions.
The prescription-based medication possession ratio is the
proportion of days covered by dispensed medication during a
period from the first to the last written prescription during the
preindex year—a methodology validated for measuring statin
adherence.12 Adherence of at least 80% was used to allow for
the effect of statin use.
Patients were excluded if they manifested uncontrolled
metabolic abnormalities, including a fasting glucose test
value of 300 mg/dL or higher, a serum thyrotropin level
above 6 mIU/L or below 0.4 mIU/L, LDL-C level greater than
130 mg/dL, or a triglyceride test result of 600 mg/dL or
higher in the 3 months preceding the index date. Patients
with active cancer (receiving antineoplastic treatment dur-
ing the preindex year) were also excluded. Patients who
were not continuous members during the preindex year
were excluded. Figure 1 illustrates the patient exclusions
diagram.
Variables
The exposure was the first observed LDL-C level achieved
after at least 1 year of statin use, which was categorized on
the basis of levels indicated in established guidelines2 as low
(≤70.0 mg/dL), moderate (70.1-100.0 mg/dL), or high (100.1-
130.0 mg/dL).
Covariates adjusted for in Cox regression models and sen-
sitivity analyses were baseline characteristics measured dur-
ing the preindex year. These included population sector and
socioeconomic status data that were based on the aggregate
classification of the patient’
s primary care clinic.13 Socioeco-
nomic status was classified as low or mid-high, and the popu-
lation sector was classified as Jewish or non-Jewish. Patient
clinical variables included preindex body mass index and time
taking statins (≥12 months). Statin treatment regimens were
Key Points
Question Should a clinician treating a patient with chronic
ischemic heart disease who is already taking statins make changes
to treatment regimens to lower low-density lipoprotein
cholesterol (LDL-C) level below 70 mg/dL?
Findings This cohort study of 31 619 patients showed no decrease
in cardiac events from lowering LDL-C level below 70 mg/dL
compared with patients with LDL-C between 70 and 100 mg/dL.
Meaning Our data do not support recommendations that treating
to LDL-C levels below 70 mg/dL are relevant for all patients with
ischemic heart disease, particularly those who are adherent to
statin treatment.

assessed as low (equivalent to simvastatin ≤20 mg), moder-
ate (equivalent to simvastatin 40 mg), and high (equivalent to
simvastatin 80 mg) potency, based on the US Food and Drug
Administration’
s classification (eTable 1 in the Supplement).14
The Charlson comorbidity index15 (categorized as scores of 0-1,
2, 3-4, and ≥5) was used to indicate morbidity burden. Chronic
kidney disease (CKD) was classified on the basis of the calcu-
lated estimated glomerular filtration rate16 of the last serum
creatinine test performed before the index date. The number
of concomitant long-term medications was measured at the
index date, grouped as 0 to 4, 5 to 7, or 8 or more drugs, and
insulin use was noted. Health service use was defined accord-
ing to event counts during 2 years prior to the index date and
included number of physician visits, PTCAs, and lipid pro-
files, each categorized at levels suggesting clinical instability.
eTable 4 in the Supplement shows which covariates were in-
cluded in the various models in the analyses.
The study outcome was the first occurrence of MACE,
which included any of the following collected from the hospi-
tal discharge records of the CHS data warehouse (Interna-
tional Classification of Diseases, Ninth Revision, codes detailed
in eTable 2 in the Supplement): myocardial infarction,
unstable angina, stroke, percutaneous coronary intervention,
coronary artery bypass grafting, or all-cause mortality during
the study period.
Statistical Analysis
We examined the distribution of sociodemographic and clini-
cal characteristics comparing the low and moderate LDL-C
groups, and the moderate and high LDL-C groups, using χ2,
t tests, and Mann-Whitney to test for differences. Kaplan-
Meier survival analysis assessed differences in time to MACE
by index LDL-C groups using the log rank test (eFigure 1 in the
Supplement).
Cox proportional hazard analyses were conducted as 2
separatemodelstodeterminethehazardforMACEbyachieved
LDL-C group: (1) low vs moderate and (2) moderate vs high.
Patients with no event were censored on December 31, 2013.
Forward stepwise regression was used, and the LDL-C group
was forced into all models. We repeated all analyses stratified
by age according to patients older or younger than 75 years to
see whether there was a differential association by age, as ob-
served in a previous study.8
To further confirm the association of MACEs and LDL-C
level, we conducted a secondary analysis using propensity
score (PS) matching because the 3 LDL-C groups differed sig-
nificantly across baseline characteristics. Propensity score
analyses were also conducted as 2 models with separate pro-
pensityscoresforlowvsmoderateandmoderatevshighLDL-C
groups. Further details on the PS analysis and matching meth-
ods can be found in eTables 4 through 6 and eFigures 2 and 3
in the Supplement. When analyzing the PS-matched popula-
tion, a robust variance sandwich-type method was used to ac-
count for pairing.17 Additionally, we performed several sensi-
tivity analyses. In the first, we assessed MACE outcomes
excluding all-cause mortality because cause-specific mortal-
ity data were not available. Second, we used a restricted cu-
bic spline analysis with knots at LDL-C levels of 70.0 and 100.0
mg/dL to examine the association with LDL-C as a continu-
ousexposure.18Last,weevaluatedpatientswithIHDwhowere
at least 50% adherent to their statin medication to represent
a more common clinical scenario (rather than ≥80% adher-
ence). Based on the population size, we estimated 90% power
to detect an 8% reduction in hazard for MACEs between the
groups. Analyses were performed using SPSS, version 22.0.0.1,
and R (R Foundation for Statistical Computing), version 3.1.1,
with Matching (version 4.8-3.4) and Coxphw (version 3.0.0)
packages.19
Results
In January 2009, there were 126 378 adult CHS members be-
tween the ages of 30 and 84 years with IHD. After all exclu-
sionswereapplied,thefinalstudypopulationcomprised31 619
patientswithIHDwhowereatleast80%adherenttotheirstatin
treatment prior to their index LDL-C measurement (Figure 1).
There were 9086 (29%) patients who had an index LDL-C of
70.0 mg/dL or less, 16 782 (53%) patients with an index LDL-C
between 70.1 and 100.0 mg/dL, and 5751 (18%) patients with
anindexLDL-Cbetween100.1and130.0mg/dL(Table1).Over-
all, 9035 patients had a MACE or died during a mean 1.6 years
of follow-up (incidence rate, 6.7 per 1000 persons per year).
The mean (SD) age in the low and moderate LDL-C groups
was 67.8 (9.6) and 67.4 (9.7) (P < .001), with 23.7% and 27.4%
female, respectively (P < .001) (Table 1). Compared with the
moderate LDL-C group, the patients with low LDL-C had sig-
nificantly more comorbidities, such as diabetes (62.5% vs
52.0%; P < .001), congestive heart failure (18.7% vs 15.4%;
P < .001), and severe CKD (stages 4 and 5) (4.4% vs 3.2%;
P < .001) and more were taking multiple long-term medica-
tions (≥8 medications) (73.2% vs 65.2%; P < .001). The low
LDL-C group had 29.5% MACEs compared with 27.4% in the
moderate LDL-C group (P < .001) (Table 1).

In the high LDL-C group, the mean (SD) age was 66.4 (10.3)
years, and there were 32.4% women (Table 1). There was a
higher rate of diabetes in the moderate LDL-C group than the
highLDL-Cgroup(52.0%vs49.8%;P = .003)butslightlylower
rates of severe CKD (stages 4 and 5) (3.2% vs 3.6%; P = .003)
and cerebrovascular accident (0.5% vs 0.8%; P = .04) com-
pared with the high LDL-C group. There were no other statis-
tically significant differences in comorbidities between the 2
groups. More patients in the moderate LDL-C group were tak-
ingmultiplelong-termmedications(≥8)thaninthehighLDL-C
group (65.2% vs 63.0%; P = .003), but there was a lower rate
of MACE (27.4% vs 30.6%; P < .001).
There were 4595 MACEs (71.0 per 1000 person-years)
among the moderate LDL-C group and 2681 events (78.1 per
1000 person-years) among the low LDL-C group. The unad-
justedhazardratio(HR)forMACEinthesegroupswas1.10(95%
CI, 1.05-1.15; P < .001), and the adjusted HR was 1.02 (95% CI,
0.97-1.07;P = .54)(Table2).AmongthehighLDL-Cgroup,there
were 1759 MACEs (rate of 81.3 per 1000 person-years). The un-
adjustedHRcomparedwiththemoderategroupwas0.87(95%
CI, 0.83-0.92; P < .001) and the adjusted HR was 0.89 (95% CI,
0.84-0.94; P < .001). The number of events for each compo-
nent of MACE by LDL-C group can be found in eTable 3 in the

patientsyoungerandolderthan75years,respectively(Table2).
In the moderate vs high LDL-C groups, the HR for the ad-
justed analyses was 0.89 (95% CI, 0.83-0.95; P = .001) for pa-
tients younger than 75 years and 0.87 (95% CI, 0.79-0.96;

tality in the outcomes, results were also consistent with the
main analysis (Table 3). When assessing the association be-
tween LDL-C and MACE among patients at least 50% adher-
ent to statin therapy, the results varied from the main analy-
sis in the moderate vs low LDL-C model with an adjusted HR

Discussion
The present study examined a large population-based cohort
of patients with preexisting IHD who were taking statins and
evaluated their clinical outcomes as a function of achieved
LDL-C levels. We found that having an LDL-C level of 70.0
mg/dL or less had no statistically significant association with
the risk of MACE compared with patients who had LDL-C be-
tween 70.1 and 100.0 mg/dL. However, LDL-C level between
70.1 and 100.0 mg/dL was significantly associated with lower
risk of MACE when compared with higher LDL-C levels of 100.1
to 130.0 mg/dL. The robustness of these observations is sup-
ported by secondary and sensitivity analyses that adjust for

differences in baseline characteristics, account for less adher-
ent patients, and examine LDL-C as a continuous exposure
through spline analysis. In the spline analysis, inflections in
the relationship between LDL-C and MACE were somewhere
below the 100.0 mg/dL knot and above the 70.0 mg/dL knot.
Whereas recent editorials have cited that lower LDL-C is
better,11,20 our study of observed LDL-C levels and their asso-
ciation with cardiac outcomes has found only partial support
for these claims. In the sensitivity analysis including patients
with lower adherence (≥50%), there was slightly increased risk
of MACE in the low LDL-C group compared with the moder-
ate LDL-C group. Whereas this may reflect clinical risk of low
levels of LDL-C, these results further support the main find-
ings of this study that achieving a level below 70 mg/dL is not
beneficial for all patients.
The evidence cited in guidelines for more aggressive
treatment of LDL-C levels comes from RCTs and a meta-
analysis of RCTs comparing high-intensity statin treatment
with lower-intensity treatment. The meta-analysis found that
more intensive therapy was associated with an overall propor-
tional risk reduction of 15% (95% CI, 11%-18%; P < .001) in
MACE compared with less intensive therapy.3 Neither of the 2
RCTs with significant findings addressed the extent of comor-
bidities or polypharmacy among their generally younger
patients with IHD, which are factors that increasingly affect
therapeutic decisions facing physicians.21(pp257-264) Further-
more, there are well-documented adverse events, such as
myalgia, nephropathy, and onset of diabetes, associated with
intensified statin treatment that contribute to clinical consid-
erations in statin regimen management.22-24 With RCTs
focused on treatment efficacy and safety, the evidence from
these trials to support claims that lower LDL-C levels are asso-
ciated with clinical benefit is not yet definitive for everyday
community-based practice.
One of the strengths of our study is the incorporation of
comorbidities,numbersofconcomitantmedications,andmea-
sures of health care use into our analytical models. Studies
demonstrating the relationship between numbers of medica-
tions and adherence to medication use emphasize the impor-
tance of these variables when treating physicians are decid-
ing on cardiovascular disease regimens.25,26 In consideration
of baseline differences in clinical characteristics between the
LDL-C groups (eg, comorbidities and number of long-term
medications), PS-matched analyses confirmed our initial find-
ings that no significant additional clinical benefit was associ-
ated with achieved LDL-C levels below 70.0 mg/dL. Another
consideration is whether the benefits of lowering LDL-C vary
by age, as seen in the Improved Reduction of Outcomes: Vy-
torin Efficacy International Trial (IMPROVE-IT) trial results.8
WeexaminedwhethertheassociationbetweenachievedLDL-C
level and MACEs differed when stratified by age and found no
differences in the significance or direction of associations from
our main analyses.
Toinformlong-termstatinmanagement,weincludedonly
patients with IHD who had been consistently taking statins for
at least 1 year and evaluated LDL-C levels of patients in com-
munity-based care. Previous evidence has not always ad-
dressed this long-term outlook. One study cited as evidence
for more intensive statin therapy measured LDL-C levels dur-
ing acute hospitalization—a period in which LDL-C levels may
fluctuate considerably.4 This highlights a fundamental differ-
ence between RCTs and our study: while RCTs do not usually
study prevalent users, these patients were the focus of our re-
search. Our findings of significantly lower risk of MACEs as-
sociated with achieved LDL-C level of less than 100.0 mg/dL
but not with achieved LDL-C of less than 70.0 mg/dL suggest
a target for long-term statin treatment.
Additional analysis examining LDL-C as a continuous ex-
posure in a cubic spline analysis rather than stratifying by pre-
defined LDL-C groups confirmed the results found in our main
analysesthatachievedLDL-Cleveloflessthan100.0mg/dLwas
associated with lower risk of MACEs, but at roughly 90 mg/dL,
this protective effect diminished and was no longer signifi-
cant. In addition to RCTs, 2 retrospective post hoc analyses of

RCT data have examined stratified groups of patients with
achieved LDL-C levels well below 70 mg/dL and the associa-
tion with cardiac outcomes.6,7 One of these studies reported a
nonsignificant finding of lower rates of MACEs with LDL-C lev-
els below 100 mg/dL but emphasized that lower LDL-C levels
may be due to differences in patient characteristics not as-
sessed in their study rather than greater treatment intensity.7
The other post hoc study6 reported that results of achieved
LDL-C after 3 months were not found to be significantly asso-
ciated with lower rates of MACEs. While these have been cited
asevidencetosupporttheargumentthatlowerLDL-Clevelsaf-
ford greater protection, our results suggest that at lower levels
of LDL-C, the clinical benefit may not be significant.
There are several limitations to consider in this study. To
best ensure treatment impact, we included only those pa-
tients who were at least 80% adherent to statin therapy dur-
ing the year prior to the index LDL-C measurement. This lim-
its the generalizability of our results to individuals who are
moreadherenttostatintreatment.Wealsorestrictedourstudy
population to patients with preexisting IHD being treated in
the community setting, which means that our findings are not
necessarily applicable to patients who have had a recent car-
diac event. Our categorization of index LDL-C was based on
an observed achieved value after at least 1 year of statin treat-
ment; however, this level may not have represented a stable
LDL-Coversubsequentyears.Additionalanalysesamongasub-
groupofthestudypopulationthathadnovariabilityfromtheir
index LDL-C over the first follow-up year demonstrated re-
sults consistent with our main analyses (results not shown).
Further to this point, future research should consider variabil-
ity of LDL-C as a potential confounder. While using all-cause
mortality in our models is a limitation, we have tried to mini-
mize the impact of this by excluding patients with cancer,
which is a leading cause of mortality in Israel.27(pp11-13) Addi-
tionally, although we conducted PS analyses to adjust for base-
line differences, it is possible that other confounders were not
accounted for in the analyses.
Conclusions
This study of more than 30 000 community-treated patients
with IHD who were adherent to statin treatment found lower
riskofMACEsassociatedwithachievedLDL-Clevelsbelow100
mg/dL,butnoadditionalbenefitwasdemonstratedwithLDL-C
below 70 mg/dL. Our results do not provide support for a blan-
ket principle that lower LDL-C is better for all patients in sec-
ondary prevention.
