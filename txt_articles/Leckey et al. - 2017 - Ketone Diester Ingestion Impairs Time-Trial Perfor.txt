We investigated the effect of pre- “race” ingestion of a 1,3-butanediol acetoacetate
diester on blood ketone concentration, substrate metabolism and performance of a
cycling time trial (TT) in professional cyclists. In a randomized cross-over design, 10
elite male cyclists completed a ∼31 km laboratory-based TT on a cycling ergometer
programmed to simulate the 2017 World Road Cycling Championships course. Cyclists
consumed a standardized meal [2 g/kg body mass (BM) carbohydrate (CHO)] the evening
prior to a trial day and a CHO breakfast (2 g/kg BM CHO) with 200 mg caffeine on the
morning of a trial day. Cyclists were randomized to consume either the ketone diester
(2 × 250 mg/kg) or a placebo drink, followed immediately by 200 mL diet cola, given
∼ 30 min before and immediately prior to commencing a 20 min incremental warm-up.
Blood samples were collected prior to and during the warm-up, pre- and post- TT and
at regular intervals after the TT. Urine samples were collected pre- and post- warm-up,
immediately post TT and 60 min post TT. Pre-exercise ingestion of the diester resulted
in a 2 ± 1% impairment in TT performance that was associated with gut discomfort and
higher perception of effort. Serum β-hydroxybutyrate, serum acetoacetate, and urine
ketone concentrations increased from rest following ketone ingestion and were higher
than placebo throughout the trial. Ketone ingestion induces hyperketonemia in elite
professional cyclists when in a carbohydrate fed state, and impairs performance of a
cycling TT lasting ∼50 min.

INTRODUCTION
Substrate utilization during exercise is influenced by several factors including the relative intensity
and duration of exercise, an individual’s training status and the effect of the preceding diet on both
the substrate pool and the prevailing hormonal milieu (Hawley et al., 2015). As exercise intensity
increases, there is a greater reliance on carbohydrate (CHO) based fuels (i.e., muscle and liver
glycogen, blood glucose, lactate) and a reduction in the utilization of fat substrates (Brooks and
Mercier, 1994). Ketone bodies provide another potential source of readily oxidized fuel for skeletal
muscle, but are predominately associated with conditions of metabolic stress such as starvation,
where they are needed to preserve essential function of peripheral tissues including the brain and
heart (Robinson and Williamson, 1980; Veech, 2004). However, there has been recent interest
 Leckey et al.
Ketone Ingestion Impairs Cycling Performance
in the notion that increasing blood ketone concentrations could
contribute to an enhancement of exercise performance by
providing a readily available, alternative oxidative substrate for
working muscle, sparing the limited stores of muscle glycogen
(Pinckaers et al., 2017). As such, models of hyperketonemia from
endogenous origin such as chronic exposure to a ketogenic diet
(Burke et al., 2017) as well as introduction of exogenous sources
of ketone bodies from ketone ester supplements (Cox et al.,
2016) have been investigated. Nevertheless, there is some concern
that the presence of high circulating concentrations of ketone
bodies could inhibit the flux of other muscle substrates, either
by impairing (rather than “sparing”) muscle CHO oxidation
and/or inhibiting adipose tissue lipolysis (Evans et al., 2017). As
such, the situations in which an available ketone supply may
benefit exercise capacity or performance may be determined
by the duration and/or intensity of exercise and the need
for combinations of muscle substrate to meet the metabolic
demands.
Ketone bodies, namely D-β-hydroxybutyrate (βHB), acetone
and acetoacetate (AcAc), are produced in the liver mitochondria
from acetyl-CoA in response to an increased mobilization of
free fatty acids (FFA) from adipose tissue in situations of
reduced CHO availability (Robinson and Williamson, 1980).
As summarized in recent reviews (Egan and D’Agostino, 2016;
Pinckaers et al., 2017), under conditions of high CHO availability,
circulating concentrations of ketone bodies are low, but are
slightly elevated (0.1–0.5 mmol/L) by an overnight fast and
further raised by exercising in a fasted state (0.5–1.0 mmol/L).
Prolonged fasting/starvation (5 days) causes a maximal increase
in rates of ketone body production (1–2 mmol/min or 140–280
g/day), leading to increased plasma concentrations that plateau
under normal physiological conditions at ∼7–10 mmol/L.
Meanwhile, chronic exposure to a ketogenic diet [low CHO (<50
g/d), low-moderate protein (∼15% of energy), high fat (75–
80% of energy)] raises plasma ketone bodies to 1–2 mmol/L
after several days, with concentrations reaching the apparent
plateau achieved by prolonged fasting, according to the level of
CHO restriction and duration of “keto-adaptation” (Pinckaers
et al., 2017). Exogenous forms of ketone bodies include ketone
salts, and more recently, ketone esters. Ingestion of the former
appears to be less effective in increasing circulating ketone body
concentrations and carries a significant salt load (Balasse and
Ooms, 1968). Recently, a newly produced ketone monoester, R-3-
hydroxybutyl R-3-hydroxybutyrate (Clarke et al., 2012), increases
in plasma ketone concentrations (3–6 mmol/L) within the hours
following its ingestion (400–600 mg/kg BM), although this may
be altered by concomitant intake of food (Evans et al., 2017;
Pinckaers et al., 2017).
To investigate the potential benefits to metabolism and sports
performance, Cox et al. (2016) studied the effects of ingesting
either CHO or CHO plus ketone ester (573 mg·kg−1 BM) on
performance in trained cyclists. Their ingestion protocol induced
a higher blood D-βHB concentration during submaximal cycling
(ranging between ∼1.5 and 3 mmol/L) and lead to a subsequent
improvement in time-trial (TT) performance by ∼2% following
ketone ester and CHO ingestion compared to the ingestion of
only CHO. However, aspects of the study design are inconsistent
with conditions of “real world” cycling competition. Accordingly,
we examined the effect of pre-“race” ingestion of a ketone diester
on blood ketone body concentrations, substrate metabolism
and performance under conditions of elite professional cycling;
ingestion of a pre-race CHO-rich meal, inclusion of a warm-up,
involvement of world-class cyclists and simulation of a real-life
course. We hypothesized that this protocol would result in acute
nutritional ketosis but that no performance improvement would
be observed due to the high intensity nature of a real-life TT event
which is dependent on the high rates of energy production from
the oxidation of CHO-based fuels.
MATERIALS AND METHODS
Ethical Approval
This study conformed to the standards set by the Declaration
of Helsinki and was approved (#20161005) by the Ethics
Committee of the Australian Institute of Sport (AIS). After
comprehensive details of the study protocol were explained to
the participants verbally and in writing, all participants provided
written informed consent.
Overview of Study Design
The study was a randomized crossover, double-blind, placebo-
controlled design using elite (professional) cyclists attending
a pre-season camp at the AIS, Canberra. On two separate
occasions, three days apart, participants completed a 20-min
standardized warm-up and rested for 5 min prior to completing
a 31 km TT performed on a cycling ergometer (Figure 1).
Participants were randomized to consume a 1,3-butanediol
acetoacetate diester (described subsequently; KET; two doses of
250 mg/kg BM) or a viscosity and color-matched (PLAC) drink,
given ∼30 min before and immediately prior to commencing the
warm up. It was not possible to completely replicate the taste
of the KET drink, but a comparably novel and bitter-tasting
PLAC was prepared from a mixture of flavor essences (rum,
almond, and bitters Angostura). Pilot testing revealed that the
intake of a small volume of diet cola immediately after the KET
and PLAC was able to quickly mask the taste and texture of
the previous drink. In any case, none of the participants had
previously ingested a ketone ester supplement and were therefore
unable to recognize its characteristics. In recognition of the
World Anti-Doping Code under which these cyclists compete,
it was ascertained that ketone supplements are not considered a
prohibited substance by the World Anti-Doping Agency.
Participants
Eleven internationally competitive male cyclists [age, 25 ± 7
(SD) y; body mass (BM), 73.7 ± 7.6 kg; ˙
VO2peak, 71.4 ± 5.6
mL/kg/min, 5.3 ± 0.3 L/min; Maximal Aerobic Power (MAP),
494 ± 20 W] from the ORICA-BikeExchange UCI World Tour
(Road Cycling) team participated in this study. Participants
included world class elite (n = 8; e.g., 2016 Paris-Roubaix
winner, stage medalists from Tour de France, Tour Down
Under, Giro d’Italia, Vuelta a España and Australian National
championship Time Trial medalists) and highly trained under 23
riders contracted to the team (n = 3).

FIGURE 1 | Overview of study design.
Preliminary Testing and Familiarization
Before commencing the experimental phase, participants visited
the laboratory to complete an incremental exercise test and a
familiarization with the cycling ergometer (Velotron, Racermate
Inc., Seattle, WA, USA) and the experimental exercise protocol
(simulated 2017 World Championships time trial course, Bergen
Norway).
Incremental Cycling Test
Participants completed a 5-min warm-up at 150 W on the cycle
ergometer (Lode Excalibur Sport, Groningen, The Netherlands),
thereafter the test protocol started at 180 W and increased 30 W
every 60 s until volitional exhaustion. MAP was determined
as the power output (PO) of the highest stage completed. If
the participant finished partway through a 60 s stage, MAP
was calculated in a pro-rata manner. During the maximal test,
expired gases were collected into a calibrated and customized
Douglas bag gas analysis system, as previously described (Russell
et al., 2002). Peak aerobic capacity ( ˙
VO2peak) was calculated as
the highest oxygen consumption recorded over a 30-s period.
˙
VO2peak and MAP were used to calculate the PO for the
individualized warm up on subsequent trial days, described
below.
Dietary Control
CHO and caffeine intake were standardized the evening before
and morning of a trial day and participants were also instructed
to abstain from alcohol during the 24 h period prior to a trial
day. Participants consumed an evening meal, snack and breakfast
prepared by the team chef, providing a CHO content of 2, 1, and
2 g/kg BM, respectively. Participants were also provided with a
post-exercise recovery drink, 20 min after the completion of the
TT (1 g/kg BM CHO and 25 g protein). The composition and
timing of all meals was repeated prior to trial two.
Synthesis of Ketone Ester
The ketone ester synthesized, 1,3-butanediol acetoacetate diester,
is a non-ionized sodium-free and pH-neutral precursor of AcAc
(D’Agostino et al., 2012). The ketone ester was synthesized by
transesterification of t-butylacetoacetate with R,S-1,3-butanediol
(Savind, Seymour, IL). The resultant product consisted of a
mixture of monoesters and diester, the ratio of which could
be adjusted by varying the stoichiometry of reactants. After
synthesis the crude product was distilled under reduced pressure
to remove all solvents and starting materials and the resultant
ketone ester was obtained and assessed for purity using gas
chromatography-mass spectrometry (GC-MS).
Trial Day Procedure
Participant Preparation
On each of the trial days, participants reported to the laboratory
in a rested and overnight (10 h) fasted state, with the timetable
creating a ∼30 min time between individuals that was repeated
on the subsequent trial day. The trial day protocol commenced
with the placement of an indwelling cannula (22G; Terumo,
Tokyo, Japan) into a cephalic vein while lying in a supine
position to allow for repeat blood sampling. A fingertip sample

of capillary blood was collected concomitantly with each cannula
sample throughout each trial for immediate measurement
of blood ketones (ß-hydroxybutyrate; FreeStyleOptium Neo,
Abbott Diabetes Care, Doncaster, Australia). Following a resting
blood sample (t = 0 min), participants were provided their
standardized CHO breakfast including 200 mg caffeine (NO-
DOZ Awakeners, Key Pharmaceuticals Pty Ltd, Macquarie Park,
Australia), to mimic typical race preparations. Participants were
instructed to consume the breakfast within 10 min, with a second
blood sample being collected at t = 30 min. At t = 70 min,
participants provided a urine sample, were weighed and fitted
with a heart rate (HR) monitor. At this time, they ingested
the first dose (250 mg/kg BM) of KET or PLAC, followed
immediately by 200 mL diet cola. At t = 90 min participants were
seated on the Velotron ergometer, blood samples (4 mL) were
collected and participants consumed their second dose in the
same manner.
Warm Up Protocol
Following the second KET or PLAC drink, participants
completed a standardized 20-min warm up on the cycle
ergometer. The set-up of the bike was performed by team
mechanics to replicate each rider’s unique bicycle position and
was fitted with a calibrated (Gardner et al., 2004) SRM cycling
power meter (scientific version, 8 strain gauge, Schoberer Rad
Meβtechnik; Jülich, Germany), set to sample at 1-s intervals. The
warm up consisted of 3 × 5 min at 50% ventilatory threshold
(VT), VT1, and VT1 plus 50% of the difference between VT1
and VT2 (156 ± 14, 312 ± 28, 355 ± 29 W, respectively),
followed by 5 min self-paced cycling. Venous and capillary blood
samples were collected every 5 min and expired gas was collected
continuously during the first 15 min of the warm up. Immediately
following the warm up participants provided a urine sample and
ingested an energy gel containing 50 mg caffeine (27 g CHO,
PowerBarPowerGel). During this time (5 min), participants were
free to complete their own preparations during which pre-TT
blood samples were collected, participants were provided with
standard pre-race instructions and the zero offset of the SRM
crank was set according to manufacturer’s instructions.
Cycling Time-Trial (World Championship Road
Cycling Time Trial Simulation)
The TT consisted of a simulation of the 2017 Bergen World
Championship TT course, based on global positioning system
(GPS) mapping data (road altitude and distance) collected by the
Orica cycling team staff (M. Quod, unpublished observations).
Cyclists completed the 31.17 km TT as fast as possible and
during the TT the only feedback provided to the participant was
the distance covered (km), cycling gear-ratio (12–27/48–54) and
road gradient (%). Participants were only informed of their TT
results following the completion of both trials. HR was collected
every 5 km and ratings of perceived exertion (RPE) using the
Borg 6–20 scale and capillary blood samples were collected at
15.74 km and immediately post TT. Participants ingested 250 mL
of commercially available 6% CHO drink (Gatorade) at 15.74
km, as this distance corresponded to the point identified by the
cyclists as the most appropriate opportunity to drink on the
actual course. Samples of venous and capillary blood, and urine,
were collected immediately following the TT and participants
were weighed. At t = TT + 20 min, blood samples were collected
and participants consumed a recovery drink (1 g/kg BM CHO)
and continued to rest quietly for a further 40 min. Blood samples
were collected at t = TT + 40 min and t = TT + 60 min,
with a final urine sample being collected at t = TT + 60 min.
Following the removal of the cannula, participants participated
in a semi-structured interview with a single researcher using a
series of standard questions to probe perceived effort, motivation
and comfort rating during the TT. When symptoms (e.g., gut
discomfort and problems) were identified, a standardized Likert
scale was used to quantify them into mild, moderate, or severe
levels. On completion of the second trial, participants were asked
whether they could identify the trial in which they received the
ketone ester, and the trial in which they had performed best. The
interview technique was used to probe levels of interest in using
a ketone ester supplement in real competition.
Analytical Procedures
Capillary blood samples were analyzed for concentration of
ketones and lactate (Lactate Pro 2, Akray, Japan). Venous blood
samples were collected into 4 mL SST vacutainers with immediate
analysis of a small aliquot for blood glucose concentrations
(Cobas Integra 400 plus, Roche Diagnostics, Switzerland). This
venous sample was then centrifuged at 1,500 g for 10 min
at 4◦C, and aliquots of serum were stored at –80◦C for
later analysis. Samples were analyzed for FFA concentrations
using a non-esterified-fatty acid (NEFA) assay kit (Wako Pure
Chemical Industries, Ltd, Osaka, Japan), βeta-hydroxybutyrate
concentrations using a β-hydroxybutyrate assay kit (Sigma-
Aldrich, Ltd, Australia) and acetoacetate (AcAc) concentrations
using an acetoacetate assay kit (Abcam, Cambridge, UK), as per
the manufacturer’s instructions. Urine samples were analyzed
for urine ketones (namely AcAc) using ketone reagent strips
(Keto-Diastix, Bayer).
Data Analysis
Statistical analysis was completed using SPSS (version 20 for
Windows; SPSS, Chicago, IL). Paired t-tests were used to analyze
average PO, cadence, HR and change in BM in the TT. Blood,
urine, PO, HR, cadence, RPE, and respiratory data from the
two trials were analyzed using a linear mixed model (treatment
× time; n = 10) with the exception of respiratory data which
includes (n = 9). When analyzing respiratory gases, an RER
> 1.0 was not included in analysis as participants were not
in steady state (n = 1, stage 3 for KET and PLAC). Statistical
significance was set at P < 0.05 and data is presented as mean ±
standard deviation (SD). TT performance was also analyzed for
magnitude-based effect sizes between conditions using a custom
spreadsheet (Hopkins, 2006). Data were log-transformed to
account for non-uniformity and effect sizes with 90% confidence
intervals [effect size (ES) ± 90% CI] were calculated and classified
as either trivial (–0.2 to 0.2 ES) small (0.2–0.6, ES), moderate
(0.6–1.2 ES), or large (1.2–2.0 ES). Where the 90% CI overlapped
small positive (0.2) and negative (0.2) values, the effect was
considered to be unclear.

Ketone Ingestion Impairs Cycling Performance
RESULTS
Participant Experiences
Eleven cyclists commenced this study, but one participant
experienced severe side effects from KET ingestion during and
after the warm-up, including prolonged vomiting and dizziness
and was unable to complete the TT. This participant withdrew
from further participation in the study. However, data for
this participant have been provided in the following analysis
in comparison to those of the other riders to investigate a
possible explanation for the occurrence of these side effects. All
participants reported gastrointestinal discomfort associated with
the intake of the ketone diester. Symptoms ranged from major
(dry retching and nausea; n = 2), to moderate nausea (n = 5) or
moderate reflux (n = 1), and minor discomfort (mild nausea; n =
2). No similar symptoms were reported with the PLAC trial. All
participants correctly nominated the trial in which they received
KET, identifying it via the gastrointestinal side-effects. However,
only four of the cyclists correctly identified the trial in which they
completed the TT in the fastest time, with one cyclist equivocal.
Although each of the riders nominated their gut symptoms as
a distraction or interference to performance, six participants
identified an “unusual” centrally-derived feeling during the TT
in the KET trial that they thought might be associated with
better performance. When asked if they would use the current
KET supplement in actual competition, prior to the unmasking
of performance results, only one participant (who reported the
least degree of discomfort during his KET trial) nominated being
“possibly” interested. The remaining participants identified the
need to remove the potential for illness and gut upset as well as
to be sure of a robust performance effect before KET would be of
value; “racing is hard enough without adding this complication.”
Performance
All cyclists completed the TT in a faster time in PLAC compared
with KET, with the crossover allocation of treatments meaning
that there was no order effect on performance. Figure 2 displays
the results of the cycling TT including group mean and individual
performances. There was an impairment to overall performance
time with KET (2 ± 1%, 58.2 s; small ES –0.42 ± 0.1, P < 0.001).
There was an impairment in cycling performance time in the
first segment of the course (0–18 km; P < 0.001) and second
segment with the climb included (18–32 km; P = 0.004) with
KET ingestion compared to PLAC. Overall the KET condition
was associated with a 3.7% reduction in average PO (KET 339
± 37 W vs. PLAC 352 ± 35 W, P < 0.001, Figure 3B) and a
lower cadence (KET 93 ± 6 rpm, PLAC 95 ± 6 rpm, P = 0.06,
Figure 3C) compared to PLAC. There was an effect of time (P <
0.001) for power output and cadence during the TT, as displayed
in Figure 3. A time × treatment interaction was reported for
HR (P = 0.001) and average HR was significantly lower in the
KET compared to PLAC condition (163 ± 7 vs. 167 ± 9 bpm,
respectively, P < 0.01; Figure 3D). RPE increased in both the
KET (16 ± 2 to 19 ± 2) and the PLAC (15 ± 2 to 19 ± 1) trials
from mid- to post-TT (P < 0.001). There was no difference in
RPE between trials despite the lower HR and PO in the KET
condition.

output (B) following exogenous KET or PLAC ingestion. Values are mean ±
SD. *KET different to PLAC.
Serum Metabolites
There was an effect of time (P < 0.001) and treatment (P = 0.021)
for serum FFA concentrations (Figure 4A). FFA concentrations
reduced from t = 0 during the 90 min following the CHO
breakfast in both KET and PLAC trials (0.37 ± 0.10 mmol/L
to 0.27 ± 0.04 mmol/L, P < 0.02). FFA concentrations were
higher in PLAC vs. KET from pre- to post-TT (P < 0.05).
A condition × time interaction was reported for serum βHB
concentrations (P < 0.001; Figure 4B). There was an increase in
βHB concentrations in the KET trial following dose one of KET
ingestion (t = 90 min) and βHB remained significantly higher
than PLAC trial until t = TT + 60 min. An increase in βHB
concentrations from t = 0 was measured in the PLAC trial at
the onset of the warm up (t = 100 min; Figure 4B) however βHB
remained lower than in the KET trial. Serum AcAc concentration
significantly increased from t = 0 min following dose one of KET
ingestion (P = 0.001) and remained higher until t = TT + 60 min
(Figure 4C).
Capillary Blood and Urine Metabolites
There was a condition × time interaction for both urine
ketone and capillary blood βHB concentrations (P < 0.001;
Figures 5A,B). No differences were observed at t = 0 between
KET and PLAC for urine ketone concentration, but following
KET ingestion, urine ketones were higher at pre-TT, post-TT, and
at t = TT + 60 min for KET. Blood βHB concentrations increased

following the first dose of KET, compared with PLAC ingestion
(0.32 ± 0.16 mmol/L, P = 0.001). Blood βHB concentrations
increased from pre-TT to post-TT in the KET trial (P < 0.001)
and this increase was maintained until t = TT + 60 min (P =
0.03; Figure 5B).
There was a significant condition × time interaction for blood
glucose (P = 0.036) and lactate concentrations (P < 0.001;

following the first dose of KET ingestion, pre-TT and t = TT +
40, compared to PLAC. Blood lactate concentrations increased
from pre-warm up at the end of stage 3 (t = 110 min) in both
the KET and PLAC trials but had returned to resting values pre-
TT for both trials. Post-TT, blood lactate concentrations were
significantly lower in the KET trial compared to the PLAC trial
(8.6 ± 3.2 vs. 13.1 ± 4.3 mmol/L, P < 0.001, respectively).
Respiratory Parameters and BM
There was a main effect of time in the KET and PLAC trials
for VO2, VCO2, and RER (P < 0.001), where an increase was
observed throughout the incremental warm up from stage 1 to
stage 3 (Table 1). There was a main effect of time for BM (P
< 0.001) where a similar loss was measured in the KET (1.6 ±
0.7 kg) and PLAC (1.4 ± 0.4 kg) trials.
DISCUSSION
This is the first study to report the effect of pre-exercise
supplementation with a ketone diester on the performance of
a cycling TT under conditions simulating real-life competition:

laboratory simulation of a World Championship TT course
in world-class male road cyclists who undertook nutritional
strategies mimicking competition practices with respect to
CHO and caffeine supplementation. Although, our protocol
achieved hyperketonemia, as evidenced by increases in serum
βHB and AcAc concentrations, there was an impairment of
TT cycling performance in these elite cyclists. This outcome
appears to be linked to the general observation of gut discomfort
and intolerance among the study participants, with symptoms
ranging from mild to severe. Our investigation adds important
information to sports nutrition, by adding a real-world element.
The primary aim of our study was to address recent reports of
enhanced sports performance associated with an acute increase
in blood ketone concentrations following the intake of a ketone
ester drink (Cox et al., 2016), by re-examining this concept
in a more ecologically valid protocol. The investigation was
undertaken as a collaborative project with a World Tour
professional team of the International Cycling Union (UCI),
offering an opportunity for them to make an evidence-based
decision regarding the potential use of a highly discussed
performance aid (Abraham, 2015). A number of features were
included in the study design to optimize the reliability and
validity of data, including opportunities to mimic the conditions
under which the performance aid (ketone ester supplement)
would be used. Team sports scientists were able to provide a
simulation of the profile of the 2017 World Championships TT
course (Bergen, Norway) on a cycle ergometer. Furthermore,

the world-class cyclists from the team who participated in
the study were personally motivated to receive individual and
group results, and were highly experienced in TT cycling as
well as familiarized to the specific laboratory-based course
simulation. Race nutrition strategies (24 h prior, pre-race and
during race) were standardized and made realistic by involving
meal preparation by the team chef to suit both sports nutrition
guidelines (Thomas et al., 2016) and the cultural practices of
the riders. This included attention to achieve adequate CHO
availability in pre-race meals (as opposed to the overnight fasted
state involved in other studies such as Balasse, 1979; Fery and
Balasse, 1986; Cox et al., 2016), as well as the real-life intake of
caffeine and CHO supplements during the pre-race and within-
race practices.
Our primary finding of a 2.0 ± 1% (58 s) longer time to
completion in the TT following ketone ingestion supports our
initial hypothesis that ketone ingestion would not enhance TT
performance (Figure 2). Although, the gut disturbances were the
likely cause of the performance impairment, we note that none of
the cyclists achieved a faster time in the ketone trial, even when
they reported very minor symptoms. Furthermore, the RPE in
the ketone trial were similar to those on the placebo trial despite
a lower power output and heart rate. This suggests that the
gastrointestinal discomfort and/or some direct effect of ketones
on the brain increased the perception of effort, and in accordance

with the psychobiological model of pacing (Pageaux et al., 2014),
our highly experienced cyclists reduced their work output to
enable the TT to be completed without premature exhaustion.
This finding warrants further investigation to confirm and
explore the mechanisms. In the meantime, we note that the
outcome of impaired performance with ketone ingestion is in
contrast to previous studies (Clarke and Cox, 2015; Cox et al.,
2016). Indeed, Clarke and Cox (2015) and Cox et al. (2016)
reported 1–2% improvements in 30 min rowing performance and
30 min TT performance, respectively, following ingestion of a
similar ketone dose to the current study (573 vs. 500 mg/kg
BM, respectively) in combination with CHO, compared to CHO
alone.
Due to the lack of a commercial supply, we were unable to
obtain the ketone monoester supplement used in the study of
Cox et al. (2016). However, we were able to source a diester
that is currently being investigated as a potential treatment for
seizures resulting from central nervous system oxygen toxicity
(D’Agostino et al., 2013) and used in a similar dose to Cox et al.
(2016). This diester contains a racemic mixture of βHB (i.e.,
contains both D- and L- enantiomers of the βHB) and has the
ability to elevate both βHB and AcAc in a 1:1 ratio. The use of
enzymatic analysis in the current study measures only the D-
enantiomer which is the main circulating form of βHB and the
most likely to have a direct effect on substrate metabolism and
skeletal muscle responses (Yamada et al., 2010).
We provided the ketone drink in two doses, with the first bolus
ingested 70 min prior to the TT. Based on previous research, our
aim was to reach peak βHB concentrations at ∼1 h following
ingestion (i.e., prior to the TT; Pinckaers et al., 2017). We
measured a modest increase in serum βHB concentrations in the
ketone trial, reaching >0.3 mmol/L following the warm-up, but
to our surprise serum βHB concentrations peaked immediately
following the TT (>0.4 mmol/L; Figure 4B). The capillary
whole blood samples analyzed for βHB concentrations measured
values 2- to 3-fold greater than the serum samples (Figure 5B).
This variation in D-βHB concentrations via enzymatic analysis
(serum) and whole blood is consistent with previous literature
reporting a –0.5 to 0.6 mmol/L higher concentration with
handheld monitors (Pineda and Cardoso, 2015). This variation
in measuring blood ketones in a controlled laboratory setting
highlights the challenges athletes face in the field when aiming
to reach and stay within the “optimal” range for a performance
benefit (Egan and D’Agostino, 2016). We also measured a peak
in serum AcAc concentrations following the warm-up, reaching
∼0.5 mmol/L (Figure 4C). Therefore, when we consider total
circulating ketones measured (i.e., βHB and AcAc) and the
L- enantiomer that has not been measured, it is likely that
athletes would be in the “optimal” range of 1–3 mmol/L for
a proposed performance benefit (Egan and D’Agostino, 2016).
Although “nutritional ketosis” was achieved, βHB concentrations
reported in the current study are much lower than those
reported previously (Cox et al., 2016). Cox et al. (2016) reported
an increased in βHB concentrations to ∼2 mmol/L within
20 min of ketone ester ingestion when co-ingested with CHO
or ∼4 mmol/L when ingested alone. This variation in serum
βHB is likely explained by a range of factors including the
different ketone esters used, the elite training status of cyclists
in the current study and the different pre-ingestion nutritional
strategies were the current study focused on appropriate race
preparation practices.
Although we have not measured the same increase in
circulating ketone concentrations as (Cox et al., 2016), ketones
increased appropriately to alter metabolic responses compared
to when a placebo was ingested. Blood glucose concentration
was lowered in the ketone trial by ∼1 mmol/L within 30 min
following ingestion of the first ketone dose, and following the
TT blood glucose was ∼2 mmol/L lower than in the placebo
trial. Additionally, we reported a 4.5 mmol/L (35%) reduction
in blood lactate concentration following the TT in the ketone
trial compared to the placebo trial. These findings of reduced
blood glucose and blood lactate concentrations are consistent
with the data of Cox et al. (2016) during 60 min of exercise at
75% Wmax and following a 30 min TT, respectively. We also
measured lower circulating FFA during the TT following ketone
ingestion compared to a placebo. Participants were cycling at
340–350 W during the TT and thus estimated contribution of
FFA oxidation to total energy expenditure would likely be low
as at this intensity, the muscle relies predominately on CHO-
based fuels (Hawley and Leckey, 2015). However, the difference
in FFA concentration between the ketone and placebo trials
could be related to circulating ketone bodies having the ability
to suppress lipolysis via inhibition of catecholamine’s (Bjorntorp
and Schersten, 1967).
As ketone bodies can be readily oxidized by skeletal muscle,
expired gas was collected during the incremental warm-up. No
differences in RER were measured between the ketone and
placebo trials, although this could be related to the absolute
exercise intensities attained by our elite subjects (155, 310,
355 W). Alternatively the high ketone concentrations in the urine
suggest that the ketones are not being oxidized at the skeletal
muscle. We have not estimated rates of substrate oxidation rates
due to βHB and AcAc yielding respiratory exchange quotient
values of 0.89 and 1.00, respectively and thus without appropriate
correction factors for CO2 displacement and urine volume this
would lead to an inaccurate representation of substrate utilization
(Frayn, 1983; Pinckaers et al., 2017). We also reported a modest
reduction in heart rate during the TT in the ketone trial
compared to the placebo trial (5 bpm) which may be associated
with a slightly reduced average power output and in the ketone
trial.

Ketone Ingestion Impairs Cycling Performance
Of the 10 participants who completed the trials, all reported
gastrointestinal discomfort associated with the intake of the
ketone ester including dry retching, mild to moderate nausea,
reflux and minor discomfort. Furthermore, one participant was
unable to start the TT due to prolonged vomiting and dizziness.
This participant also experienced the highest concentrations of
serum AcAc concentration when compared to the other 10
participants (Figure 4C, participant X), suggesting bioavailability
of the ketone diester may impact individual responses following
ketone ingestion. Although the side effects of ketone esters are
not frequently discussed in the literature, Clarke et al. (2012)
has provided evidence that participants have experienced a range
of adverse effects including vomiting, nausea, diarrhea, and
abdominal pain. These side effects have been associated with high
dose of ketone ester and the consumption of the ester with a
milk-based drink (Clarke and Cox, 2015). While it is possible
that different dosing strategies, or the use of a different ketone
ester product might eliminate or greatly reduce the gut problems
seen in the current study, it is unclear whether a performance
enhancement could be expected with exogenous ketone use in
sporting events undertaken under the conditions employed in
our study.
In conclusion, the results of the current study show
that ingestion of a 1,3-butanediol acetoacetate diester under
conditions of optimal race nutrition (i.e., CHO fed) results in
increases in βHB and AcAc concentrations. The diester was
associated with gut discomfort and intolerance among the cyclists
with symptoms ranging from mild to severe. Despite optimal
nutritional support (i.e., CHO breakfast, feeding during the
TT and caffeine ingestion) for performance, ketone ingestion
was associated with an increase in perception of effort, leading
to an impairment of TT performance in elite professional
cyclists.
