ABSTRACT
Objective: Prevalence of type 1 diabetes (T1D)
disease is increasing worldwide. We aim to test
correlation of T1D prevalence to the reduced natural
selection measured by Biological State Index (Ibs).
Research design and methods: Country-specific
estimates of T1D prevalence, life expectancy, obesity
prevalence rate, urbanization rates, per capita sugars
consumption and per capita gross domestic product
(GDP) were obtained. Ibs and country-specific longevity
(e50) increase for each country were self-calculated.
These data were then matched to T1D prevalence by
country for our ecological study among 118 countries.
Countries were also grouped to study the associations
in different regions. SPSS V.22 was used for
correlation analysis.
Results: Worldwide, both Ibs and life expectancy at
birth (Ibs proxy) were significantly correlated to T1D
prevalence in Pearson r (r=0.713, p<0.001 and
r=0.722, p<0.001, respectively) and Spearman’s r
(r=0.724, p<0.001 and r=0.689, p<0.001, respectively).
T1D prevalence was not correlated to longevity
increase measured as life expectancy at 50 years old.
T1D prevalence was significantly associated with Ibs
(r=0.307, p<0.001) and newborn life expectancy
(r=0.349, p<0.001) independent of per capita total
sugar consumption, per capita GDP, urbanization and
obesity prevalence in partial correlation. Globally, both
life expectancy at birth and Ibs exponentially correlated
to T1D prevalence. Pearson correlations generally
existed in different country categorizations by
geographic region, culture background and economic
status.
Conclusions: Reduced natural selection may have
contributed to the increasing T1D prevalence
worldwide. T1D epidemiology study in total population
may be the practical solution to identify the causes of
increasing T1D prevalence.
BACKGROUND
Type 1 diabetes (T1D) is an autoimmune
disease with a strong genetic component.1 2
It can occur at any age, but tends to develop
in childhood,3 so it has long been called
‘juvenile diabetes’. T1D is characterized by
destruction of pancreatic β-cells, culminating
in absolute insulin deficiency.4 As of 2014, an
estimated 387 million people have diabetes
worldwide,5
of
which
T1D
accounts
for
between 5% and 10%.6 Diabetic complica-
tions continue to be a major cause of mor-
bidity and mortality in persons with T1D.7
Great efforts have been made to assess the
incidence
and
prevalence
of
T1D.
Unfortunately, the exact etiology and patho-
genesis of T1D is still unknown. Generally,
longitudinal or cross-sectional studies are
often
locally
or
regionally
performed.
Consequently, it is difficult to access general-
izable results because the epidemiology of
T1D is known to be heterogeneous regarding
geography and ethnicity. Genetic predispos-
ition to T1D is only alleged to explain some
of the geographic variability in T1D occur-
rence, but it cannot account for its rapidly
increasing frequency.8 A number of studies
have
associated
gross
domestic
product
(GDP) level with T1D prevalence or inci-
dence,8–11 but GDP does not fully explain
variations and trends in T1D prevalence
rates
observed
in
many
countries,
for
example Japan. It has been postulated that
environmental factors may be able to trigger
an autoimmune destruction of the β-cells
leading to absolute dependence on insulin
treatment,8
9
12–17 however, these environ-
mental factors are circumstantial.13
Natural selection, as one of the basic
mechanisms of evolution, is the differential
survival and fertility of individuals due to

 differences in phenotype that reflect genetic differences.
In our modern society, natural selection still acts on all
members of a population, selecting those individuals
that have an increased reproductive success (survival
and/or fertility).18 The ‘Biological State Index (Ibs)’ has
been proposed to measure the populational reproduct-
ive success by taking into account potential loss of repro-
ductive success by dying at age x, summed over all age
categories.19 20 The Ibs is calculated by combining age-
specific death frequency (dx variable of a life table) with
an age-specific reproductive loss (sx):
Ibs ¼ 1 �
X
x¼v
x¼0
dx:Sx
where dx is the frequency of death at age x or represents
the mortality rate, sx the reproductive loss from dying at
age x, that is, the estimated probability of not possessing
the complete number of births at age x. sx is based on
the cumulative number of births at specific ages.20 21
The construction and interpretation of the Ibs was predi-
cated on the assumption that heritability of human fer-
tility variance is negligible.22
An Ibs value of 1 indicates total adaptation of the
population to their environment (ability to overcome
selection pressures that are present). An Ibs value of 0
signifies a total lack of adaptation (inability to overcome
selection pressures that are present), and an impossibil-
ity to give life to the next generation. An Ibs value close
to 0 indicates large effective natural selection pressures
acting on a population, since few individuals are surviv-
ing to produce offspring. In such a scenario there is a
possibility for fast evolution, since many genes may not
be passed to the next generation. An Ibs value close to 1
indicates that natural selection is not having much effect
on the population since many individuals are able to
maximally contribute to producing the next generation.
Thus, the Ibs permits the estimation of the magnitude of
the successful reproduction of a population.
The genetic trait of T1D may allow individuals from a
population to pass their T1D genes on to their next gen-
eration. What fraction of a population had a chance to
fully participate in reproducing under a given set of mor-
tality conditions may be associated with the proportion of
population carrying T1D genes in the next generation.
Previously, Stephan and Henneberg23 raised a concern
that the developed populations may have accumulated
more unfavorable genes, such as T1D genes because
natural selection (measured by the Ibs) has been greatly
reduced. Recently, a systematic review concluded that the
T1D prevalence rate was associated with age increase in
population.3 Therefore, the objective of the current
paper was to use country-specific data to test, from a
global perspective, that population with greater Ibs value,
fuelled by life expectancy at birth, may have higher T1D
prevalence, using empirical, macro-level data collected
from the major international organizations.
MATERIAL AND METHOD
The dependent variable in the analysis was the country-
specific estimate of T1D prevalence (sum of rates in
0–14 and 15+years old groups) which was published by
the International Diabetes Federation (IDF) in 2000.24
We used Ibs and life expectancy at birth of each country
as the independent variables. The Ibs was calculated as
proposed
by
Henneberg20
and
Henneberg
and
Piontek19 with the fertility data of each country pub-
lished by United Nations in 200825 and the mortality
data of life tables (2009) published by WHO in 2012.26
Life expectancy at birth is a proxy for Ibs since it
expresses an opportunity of a newborn to survive to a
specific age, which is usually an age falling into repro-
ductive life span or above it. We extracted the country-
specific life expectancy (years) at birth by country pub-
lished by WHO in 2013.27
GDP
,8–11 urbanization8 and body weight status17 have
been associated with T1D prevalence. It has been sug-
gested that a population with greater sugar consumption
may have greater diabetes (total) prevalence28 and that
sugar consumption may affect health of patients with
T1D.29 Therefore, we controlled for market availability
of sugars and sweeteners (sugars in short) in g/capita/
day in each country for year 2010 from United Nations
Food
and
Agricultural
Organization
(FAO)
Food
Balance Sheet, per capita GDP (expressed in purchasing
power parity in 2010 US dollars for comparability among
countries) and urbanization (percentage of population
living in urban areas in each country in 2010) from the
World Bank’s World Development Indicators Database,
and obesity prevalence rate (percentage of the popula-
tion aged 18+ years old with body mass index (BMI)
≥30 kg/m2 in each country during 2010) from the
WHO.
No ethical approval or written informed consent for
participation was required in this study as all the afore-
mentioned
data
were
freely
downloaded
from
the
United Nations agents’ websites.
We aligned all independent variables and confound-
ing factors with the country-specific T1D prevalence,
and obtained a set of data for 118 countries. All country-
specific data were put in a uniform format. Each country
was treated individually and all of their available infor-
mation was analysed. Data of calculated Ibs and summary
statistics are further described in the supporting infor-
mation (see online supplementary tables S1 and S2).
In order to demonstrate the universal association
between T1D prevalence and Ibs and life expectancy at
birth respectively in different country groupings, we
categorized
the
countries
for
correlation
analyses
based on (1) the WHO regional classifications;30 (2)

tions, per capita GDP levels and/or cultural back-
grounds.

In
our
analysis,
we
only
included those countries for which we could access
their data for the specific groupings.
To a large extent, grouping countries for analysis may
also allow us to align our findings against previous local or
regional studies regarding heterogeneous T1D epidemi-
ology due to various geographic location and ethnicity.
It might be considered that T1D prevalence is a result
of the increase in longevity rather than relaxed natural
selection of the genetic background of T1D since
general health and advances in medical care improve
survival of patients with T1D. This consideration is clari-
fied by much stronger correlation between T1D preva-
lence and Ibs than that between T1D and life expectancy
(e50) increase (across two periods of 1950–1955 and
2005–2010). The rationale to use country-specific life
expectancy (e50) is that (1) the estimate of life expect-
ancy based on this segment of the population may not
be biased with child (0–15 years) mortality, in particular
due to deaths caused by T1D disease, and (2) deaths of
adults, especially females, during the reproductive life
span (15–50 years) that may differentiate numbers of
T1D genes passed on to new generations. Thus, we
obtained country-specific life expectancies (e50) for the
periods of 1950–1955 and 2005–2010 respectively from
the WHO life tables.37 And then we calculated the life
expectancy increase from the period of 1950–1955 to
the period of 2005–2010 for each country producing a
new variable, which is ‘life expectancy increase (e50,
1950–2010)’ for each country across the 55 years. We
repeated the above correlation analysis after we replaced
the variable of ‘life expectancy at birth’ with life expect-
ancy increase (e50, 1995–2010).
Pearson’s correlation coefficient, Spearman’s r and
partial correlation analyses were conducted using SPSS V.
22 (SPSS Inc, Chicago Illinois, USA). In this study, the
data were log transformed for correlation analysis in SPSS.
RESULTS
Worldwide T1D prevalence was in significant associations
with
Ibs
using
Pearson
r
(r=0.713,
p<0.001)
and
Spearman’s
r
(r=0.724,
p<0.001),
respectively.
The
similar associations were also observed between T1D and
life expectancy in Pearson model (r=0.722, p<0.001) and
Spearman’s
model
(r=0.689,
p<0.001),
respectively
(table 1). Further investigation with partial correlation
analysis showed that worldwide the association between
T1D prevalence was still strongly associated with Ibs
(r=0.307,
p<0.001)
and
life
expectancy
(r=0.349,
p<0.001) when we controlled for per capita total sugars
availability, per capita GDP
, urbanization and obesity
prevalence (table 1). All confounders were in significant
associations with T1D prevalence rate in both Pearson r
and Spearman’s r.
Globally, T1D is noted to be exponentially related with
both Ibs (R2=0.5203) and life expectancy (R2=0.5302)
(figures 1 and 2) after we removed two outliers of
extremely high T1D prevalence in Finland and Sweden,
respectively.
Worldwide, strong positive Pearson r coefficients were
observed in the correlation of Ibs to life expectancy
(proxy of Ibs, r=0.908, p<0.001) and to GDP (r=0.781,
p<0.001).
Table 2 presented that Europe had the significant asso-
ciations with Ibs (r=0.502, p=0.001) and life expectancy
(r=0.610, p<0.001), respectively. The sub-Europe (EEA)
also had the very strong associations of T1D prevalence

 to both Ibs (r=0.479, p=0.009) and life expectancy
(r=0.574, p=0.001) (table 3). We observed the slightly
negative correlations of T1D prevalence rate to the Ibs
and life expectancy, respectively, in two Asian country
groupings, SEARO (South-East Asia) and the ACD (table
3). Both Ibs and life expectancy were insignificantly asso-
ciated with T1D prevalence rate in other four WHO
regions, AFRO, AMRO, EMRO and WPRO (table 2).
Table 3 showed that the T1D prevalence rate was asso-
ciated with both the Ibs and newborn life expectancy in
the groupings consisting of countries with similar cul-
tures (Arab World and EEA) and different cultures
(APEC
and
OECD),
with
similar
economy
status
(OECD) and those with economy status in disparity
(APEC), and with the heterogeneous region (LAC) and
the homogeneous area (EEA and ACD).
Table 4 showed that in general T1D prevalence is not
correlated to longevity increase, but strongly correlated to
Ibs at country level. Life expectancy increase (e50, 1950–
2010) does not correlate significantly with T1D prevalence
in Pearson correlation (r=0.165, p=0.079) or Spearman’s r
(r=0.166, p=0.077). These contrasted with the correlation
between Ibs and T1D prevalence in Pearson correlation
(r=0.713, p<0.001) and in Spearman r (r=0.724, p<0.001),
respectively. In partial correlation analysis, when we con-
trolled for GDP
, BMI≥30, urbanization and sugars intake,
T1D was negatively and insignificantly correlated to life
expectancy
increase
(e50,
1950–2010)
(r=−0.070,
p=0.487), but it was in strong and significant correlation to
Ibs (r=0.276, p=0.005).
DISCUSSION
The worldwide trend of increased T1D prevalence likeli-
hood has multiple etiologies, which may act through
multiple mechanisms. By assessing the T1D prevalence
rate data for 118 countries we have shown that globally
and regionally population which had greater value of Ibs
(less opportunity for natural selection) may have greater
T1D prevalence and secondly, that newborn life expect-
ancy was significantly associated with T1D prevalence
rate at population level.
Overall, the operation of natural selection on contem-
porary populations is declining due to modern medi-
cine,23 but the magnitude of the decline may differ
between countries due to their specific level of sanita-
tion, medical interventions and public health measures.
Natural selection is still one of the major evolutionary
forces that informs changes in gene frequencies in a
population through the action of differential fertility
and mortality over generations.38 For example, studies
have shown that the increasing prevalence rates of a par-
tially heritable disease, nasal septa and lacrimal bone
defects may be attributed to the decreasing effect of
natural selection.39 More than 40 genetic loci located in
different chromosomes have been associated with T1D
in multiple studies.1 2 Although T1D can be fatal, the
majority
of
genetically
predisposed
people
do
not
develop T1D.40 This allows for accumulation of genetic
predisposition in human populations. This accumulation
will increase when fewer persons who developed a
disease would die. Differential fertility and mortality are
the basic events of natural selection, which operate
singly or jointly to determine the fitness (reproductive
success) of a particular population in a given environ-
ment.38
The
country-specific
fertility-based
and
mortality-based Ibs at different levels may indicate their
different successful reproduction opportunities of indivi-
duals in the succeeding countries.23 The reproduction
success opportunity of each population may determine
their magnitude of T1D genes accumulation, thus influ-
enced prevalence rate of patients with T1D in their next
generations. In the present study, the correlation of Ibs

was compatible with suggestion that lower opportunity
for
selection
allows
accumulation
of
unfavorable
genes.23
41 Our analysis of correlations between T1D
prevalence and Ibs by region or by WHO grouped coun-
tries seem to indicate that in regions where insulin was
available earlier and that had better availability of health-
care the relationship is stronger. This provides the
analog of a snapshot what could happen at different
times in the same region as time from insulin introduc-
tion and improvement of healthcare increased. Thus,
the distribution across different populations could be
interpreted as a surrogate measure of the evolution in
time of T1D prevalence after the
introduction
of
insulin. Artificial insulin introduced for T1D treatment
and increasing insulin availability may have played a key
role in reducing natural selection as insulin enables
countless people with onset of T1D to survive3 and
maintain normal reproductive capacity.42 This may have
been boosting T1D genes accumulation and prevalence
of T1D. T1D can affect people of any age, but usually
occurs in children or sexually mature young adults3 who
have greater potential to reproduce than older adults.
T1D has been historically, and continues to be, the most
common type of diabetes in children and adolescents.43
Insulin is the priority for T1D treatment. Otherwise,
patient with T1D may only live up to 1 year, some only a
week. Several human generations have benefited from
insulin since it was discovered and became available in
early 1920s.44 Reduced natural selection boosted by
insulin
treatment
of
several
generations
may
have
enabled cumulative effect of T1D genes frequency in
human population to occur quickly and to be noticeable
for a couple of decades.9 Studies have shown that a par-
tially heritable disease, phenylketonuria was only notice-
able after being accumulated for several generations23
with about 2% increase in each.45
T1D prevalence/incidence is increasing worldwide46
with special regard to the developed countries.9 10 47
This may be partially attributable to earlier and greater
affordability of insulin, in addition to relative more
reduced natural selection (greater Ibs values) in those
developed countries. Although exogenous insulin can
be obtained from animals (bovine and porcine),44 pro-
duction, transportation, storage and administration of
such insulin was extremely expensive,48 which may be
beyond the affordability of many patients with T1D,
especially those from developing countries. Biosynthetic
insulin based on DNA technology has been commer-
cially available since 198244 and it has been thought that
it
can
continue
to
accommodate global
demand44
because of low cost from the production to administra-
tion. However, unfortunately life-saving insulin is still less
accessible, affordable, or both to people diagnosed with
diabetes in a developing country than their counterparts
in the developed world.49 This lower survivorship of
patients with T1D may contribute to lower prevalence
figures directly, besides the fact that less predisposing
genes have accumulated in the gene pools of those
countries.

 Our study showed that the relationship between life
expectancy and T1D prevalence rate was exponential
(figure 2, R2=0.5266). The Australian Institute of Health
and Welfare (AIHW) also indicated the exponential rela-
tionship between T1D prevalence rate between age
increase of Australian population through the Australian
National Diabetes Register.50 Additionally, Neville et al51
reported that the increased longevity of diabetic patients
contributed to the increasing prevalence of diabetes in
Japanese population. The life expectancy gap between
patients with T1D and non-diabetic people has reduced
significantly52
due
to
developments
in
sanitation,
medical
interventions
and
public
health
measures.
Therefore, the underlying reason for the exponential
relationship in our study may be because the number of
individual patients with T1D have increased in the
human population.3 The American Diabetes Association
has also stated that the majority of individuals with T1D
are adults even though T1D has been more frequent
and a relatively straightforward diagnosis in children.53
The correlations of T1D prevalence rates to both Ibs
and life expectancy were not only observed worldwide,
but also in different country groupings sharing specific
characteristics such as geographic locations (table 2),
culture backgrounds (table 3) and affiliations to inter-
national functional organizations (table 3). Results’
highlights indicated that the correlations of Ibs and life
expectancy to T1D were significant or very strong in
European country groupings (WHO-Europe in table 2
and EEA in table 3), but very weak in Asian country
grouping (WHO-SEA in table 1 and ACD in table 3).
This may be attributable to high-genetic predisposi-
tions13–15 46 in Europe, but low-genetic predisposition in
Asia.46 53
Although we found that the correlations of Ibs and life
expectancy to T1D prevalence rate existed globally and
in different country groupings categorized with a variety
of criteria, there are several limitations, including the
intrinsic
limitations
(conceptualized
as
ecological
fallacy) to this study.
First, the data analyzed were calculated for per capita
in each country, so we could only demonstrate the rela-
tionships between T1D prevalence rate and Ibs and life
expectancy at country/population level, which does not
necessarily correspond to the same relationships holding
true at the individual level. We also need to point out
that it would be difficult to test the relationships at the
individual level due to very rare T1D occurrence rate.
Second, the slow changes in the genetic code of the
human populations may not fully explain the increasing
T1D prevalence. Non-genetic (environmental) factors
partially determine whether, and how risk-associated gen-
otypes may lead to overt T1D disease. Unfortunately, our
Ibs does not indicate if fitness change at population level
is due to evolution of individuals or change/s. It may also
be that altered lower natural immunity to infections fol-
lowing
decades
of
using
antibiotics
may
influence
increased rates of autoimmune diseases including T1D.
Third, the data compiled and/or collected by the
major international agencies (IDF, WHO, FAO and the
World Bank) are fairly crude, and may contain some
random errors.
Finally, current evidence of the increasing frequency
of many heritable genetic disorders, including T1D does
not appear to be available. To the best of our knowl-
edge, the T1D prevalence rate for all age groups at
country level published by IDF may be the only version
to single out T1D prevalence worldwide after consulting
the major diabetes research or data collecting institu-
tions. This may be because clinically, adult T1D is diffi-
cult to discriminate from certain forms of type 2
diabetes and from latent autoimmune diabetes in adults
(LADA).53 Therefore, we do not know how much this
set of data was confounded by other forms of diabetes.
The current prevailing paradigm on the increasing
prevalence of T1D is that environmental pressures are
now able to trigger genotypes.8 9 12–17 Currently, medical
gene intervention in modern medicine at this stage
cannot remove T1D genes, and eugenics (improvement
in the genetic stock) can offer no direction due to
ethics issue. Therefore, study of T1D epidemiology
based on prevalence/incidence T1D data of all age
groups has become imperative as it may offer optimal
solution to address or at least slow down T1D genetic
load increases in different populations.
CONCLUSIONS
Our study suggested that reduced natural selection (Ibs)
may be the major contributor to the increasing preva-
lence of T1D worldwide with special regard to European
countries. It seems that T1D epidemiology study based
on all age groups may be the practical solution to iden-
tify the causes of increasing T1D prevalence and to
address, or at least slow down, T1D genetic load
increases in different populations as modern medicine
cannot operate effectively at the gene level yet.
