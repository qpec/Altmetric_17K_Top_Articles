ABSTRACT
Overactivation of Src has been linked to the pathogenesis of autosomal dominant polycystic kidney dis-
ease (ADPKD). This phase 2, multisite study assessed the efficacy and safety of bosutinib, an oral dual
Src/Bcr-Abl tyrosine kinase inhibitor, in patients with ADPKD. Patients with ADPKD, eGFR$60 ml/min per
1.73 m2, and total kidney volume $750 ml were randomized 1:1:1 to bosutinib 200 mg/d, bosutinib 400
mg/d, or placebo for #24 months. The primary endpoint was annualized rate of kidney enlargement in
patients treated for $2 weeks who had at least one postbaseline magnetic resonance imaging scan that
was preceded by a 30-day washout (modified intent-to-treat population). Of 172 enrolled patients, 169
received at least one study dose. Per protocol amendment, doses for 24 patients who initially received
bosutinib at 400 mg/d were later reduced to 200 mg/d. The annual rate of kidney enlargement was
reduced by 66% for bosutinib 200 mg/d versus placebo (1.63% versus 4.74%, respectively; P=0.01) and
by 82% for pooled bosutinib versus placebo (0.84% versus 4.74%, respectively; P,0.001). Over the treat-
ment period, patients receiving placebo or bosutinib had similar annualized eGFR decline. Gastrointes-
tinal and liver-related adverse events were the most frequent toxicities. In conclusion, compared with
placebo, bosutinib at 200 mg/d reduced kidney growth in patients with ADPKD. The overall gastrointestinal
and liver toxicity profile was consistent with the profile in prior studies of bosutinib; no new toxicities were
identified. (ClinicalTrials.gov: NCT01233869).

Autosomal dominant polycystic kidney disease
(ADPKD) is a hereditary disorder that affects up
to one in 1000 people and is characterized by the
development of cysts in the kidney and other or-
gans.1 Disease progression leads to the gradual loss
of renal function, reaching ESRD in many cases.2
Clinical approaches to managing ADPKD are pri-
marily supportive, such as focusing on hyperten-
sion and other secondary complications.2,3
ADPKD results from germ-line mutations in the
PKD1 (85% of cases) or PKD2 (15% of cases)
genes, with subsequent dysfunction of the gene
products polycystin (PC)-1 and PC-2.1 PC-1
participates in multiprotein complexes within
cell-cell adherens junctions, desmosomes, and fo-
cal adhesions that transduce intracellular signals

 triggered by a2b1-integrin2mediated cell matrix interac-
tions.4–6 Dysregulation of associated signaling networks
can result in epithelial cell proliferation and anomalous cell
polarity/migration characteristic of renal cyst expansion.7–9
Src is a key regulator of cell matrix– and growth factor re-
ceptor–mediated signaling and is overexpressed and activated
in several epithelial cancers, whereby Src inhibition results in
decreased proliferation, adhesion, and migration.10–12 Src ac-
tivation, specifically phosphorylation of tyrosine 418, and
polycystic kidney disease (PKD) progression has been dem-
onstrated in mouse and rat models of PKD with the degree of
correlation related to disease progression.13 Thus, it has been
hypothesized that Src might be a therapeutic target for the
treatment of ADPKD.14
Bosutinib (SKI-606) is an oral dual Src/Bcr-Abl tyrosine ki-
nase inhibitor (TKI) approved for the treatment of Philadelphia
chromosome–positive chronic myeloid leukemia (CML) in
patients resistant/intolerant to prior imatinib.15 In mouse
and rat models of PKD, bosutinib reduced kidney size and
the number of renal cysts and reduced tyrosine 418 phosphor-
ylation as indicated on immunoblots of extracts prepared
from the kidneys of bosutinib-treated animals.13 Subsequent
observations confirmed that Src activity is increased in hu-
man kidneys and that bosutinib reduces epithelial cell matrix
adhesion.14
This phase 2 study assessed the efficacy and safety of
bosutinib in patients with ADPKD.
RESULTS
Patients
Among 172 patients enrolled, 169 received $1 study dose
(mean [SD] age, 38.5 [7.4] years; median [range] total kidney
volume [TKV], 1376.30 [751.55–7329.00] ml; median [range]
eGFR, 85.90 [53.19–130.50] ml/min per 1.73 m2; Table 1).
Among the safety population, 58, 31, and 56 patients received
bosutinib 200, 400 mg/d, or placebo, respectively (Figure 1);
24 patients who initially received bosutinib 400 mg/d reduced
the dose to 200 mg/d (per protocol amendment). Ninety-
three (55%) completed and 75 (44%) discontinued from
the initial treatment period, primarily owing to treatment-
related adverse events (AEs; n=29 of 75 [39%]) and/or con-
sent withdrawal (n=23 of 75 [31%]). An additional subject
discontinued before the end of the initial treatment period
for a total of 76 discontinuations; however, this patient had a
status of “ongoing” because of an error with the subject’s
summary page on the case report form. The median (range)
duration of therapy for the initial treatment period was
686.0 (28–761) days for bosutinib 200 mg/d, 49.0 (5–724)
days for 400 mg/d, 703.0 (537–727) days for 400/200 mg/d,
and 691.5 (1–747) days for placebo. The median (range) dura-
tion of therapy for the total (initial plus extended) treatment
periods was 713.5 (28–1032), 49.0 (5–724), 746.5 (537–1067),
and 698.0 (1–1028) days, respectively.
Efficacy
Annualized Rate of Kidney Enlargement
In the modified intent-to-treat (mITT) population (bosutinib
200 mg/d, n=27; 400 mg/d, n=7; 400/200 mg/d, n=21; pla-
cebo, n=33), the annualized rate of kidney enlargement
(primary endpoint) was lower (66% reduction) with bosuti-
nib 200 mg/d versus placebo (1.63% versus 4.74% per year;
P=0.01; Table 2). The annualized rate of kidney enlargement
was also lower with bosutinib 400/200 mg/d versus placebo
(20.20% versus 4.74%; P,0.001); this decrease was greater
thanwith bosutinib 200 mg/d (104% versus 66%), suggesting a
dose-dependent response. Changes in TKV from baseline over
the 25-month study duration are shown in Supplemental
Table 1; across treatment groups, these changes were gener-
ally smaller in patients with baseline TKV$750–1500 versus
.1500 ml (Supplemental Table 2).

 eGFR
The annualized rate of eGFR decline (mITT population) was
similar for placebo versus bosutinib 200, 400, or 400/200 mg/d
(22.54 versus 23.09, 27.43, and 24.76 ml/min per 1.73 m2
per year, respectively; Table 2). eGFR declined from baseline
over time for all treatment groups; there was a general trend
toward dose-dependent worsening of eGFR with increasing
bosutinib dose that was partially reversible during the 30-
day washout after the initial treatment period. However, dif-
ferences in eGFR from baseline at month 24 or 25/end of
initial treatment period were not significant (Supplemental
Table 1).
Changes in Serum Creatinine from Baseline over Time
Mean serum creatinine values were increased in all bosuti-
nib groups at day 15; these remained stable over the 24-
month initial treatment period and then returned close to
baseline after a 30-day washout at the end of this period
(Figure 2). Small increases in serum creatinine were also
observed with bosutinib 200 and 400/200 mg/d at month 26
during the extended treatment period; these levels again
returned close to baseline after a 30-day washout at the
end of this period.
Composite Measures of Disease Progression
For the mITT-2 population (bosutinib, 200 mg/d, n=43;
400 mg/d, n=10; 400/200 mg/d, n=24; placebo, n=45), the
hazard ratio for the multiple occurrence of four components
of ADPKD progression was similar for all bosutinib treatment
groups versus placebo (Table 2).
The Kaplan–Meier estimated median time to onset/wors-
ening was not reached for individual measures of ADPKD
progression in any treatment group (Supplemental Figures
1–4). The hazard ratio for worsening of hypertension was
similar for all bosutinib groups versus placebo (Table 2). How-
ever, onset/worsening of hypertension (postrandomization)
generally occurred later with bosutinib versus placebo (days
15, 180, 90 for bosutinib 200, 400, 200/400 mg/d, respectively,
versus day 30 for placebo), as did PKD-related chronic back/
flank (renal) pain (day 30 for 200 and 400 mg/d and day 270
for 400/200 mg/d versus day 15 for placebo) and hematuria
(day 330 for 200 mg/d and day 180 for 400 and 400/200 mg/d
versus day 45 for placebo). Treatment differences in the earli-
est onset/worsening of proteinuria were not apparent (day 360
for 200 mg/d and day 270 for 400/200 mg/d versus day 540 for
placebo [no events observed for 400 mg/d]). For each treat-
ment group, urine protein-to-creatinine ratio values remained

 constant over the 24-month initial treatment period (Supple-
mental Figure 5). No patients developed ESRD during the
study period.
Safety
Overall, treatment-emergent AEs (TEAEs; any causality) oc-
curred more frequently with bosutinib 400 and 400/200 mg/d
versus bosutinib 200 mg/d and placebo (Table 3). TEAEs
(incidence$30% in any treatment group) were most com-
monly gastrointestinal, primarily diarrhea, which occurred
more frequently with bosutinib versus placebo (200 mg/d,
45%; 400 mg/d, 84%; 400/200 mg/d, 75%; placebo, 20%).
Liver-related TEAEs were also more common with bosutinib
versus placebo; these were primarily events of increased alanine
aminotransferase (ALT) and aspartate aminotransferase (AST)
and were generally of mild severity (Table 3). Increases in ALT
and AST levels from baseline were greatest with bosutinib
400 mg/d; these increases were transient, returning close to base-
line by the end of the initial treatment period (Supplemental
Figures 6 and 7). Overall, treatment-related TEAEs followed a
similar pattern (Supplemental Table 3).
Six patients experienced treatment-related serious AEs (in-
creased ALT, increased AST, acute hepatitis, abnormal pancreatic
enzymes,acuterenal failure,and anemia);thesewereconfined to
thebosutinibgroups(200mg/d,n=3[5%];400mg/d,n=2[7%];
200/400 mg/d, n=1 [4%]) and all resolved. One patient receiving
bosutinib 200 mg/d died on study owing to sepsis deemed not
treatment related.
More discontinuations due to treatment-related AEs oc-
curred with bosutinib 400 mg/d versus 200 mg/d (94%
[n=17 of 18] versus 60% [n=9 of 15]); both rates were higher
than placebo (43% [n=3 of 7]). Treatment discontinuation
that occurred was most commonly the result of increased
ALT (bosutinib 200 mg/d, n=6; 400 mg/d, n=5; placebo,
n=1). All events resolved without sequelae except one, and
the status of another was unknown (both bosutinib 400 mg/d).
Permanent discontinuation due to treatment-related grade 4
AEs occurred in four patients receiving bosutinib 400 mg/d
(lipase increased, n=1; ALT increased, n=2; acute hepatitis,
n=1) and two receiving bosutinib 200 mg/d (ALT increased,
n=1; hepatotoxicity, n=1).
Pharmacokinetics
Increases in bosutinib exposure were dose-proportional, with
maximal observed concentrations of 32.6, 74.9, and 84.6 ng/ml,
and area under the concentration versus time profiles from time
0 to t (where t = dosing interval = 24 hours) of 437, 1040, and
1149 ng3h/ml achieved for 200, 400, and 400/200 mg/d, re-
spectively, on day 1. Plasma accumulation was approximately
two-fold after 15 days of dosing.

Bosutinib in ADPKD
3409

CLINICAL RESEARCH
 DISCUSSION
The results of this study demonstrate that bosutinib reduced
kidney growth rate in patients with ADPKD (66% slower with
bosutinib 200 mg/d versus placebo annually). Notably, the
change in median kidney volume from baseline to end of treat-
ment was approximately 100 ml smaller with bosutinib
200 mg/d versus placebo (62.7 [range, 2168.7 to 1004.8] ml
versus 168.1 [2147.6 to 558.9] ml). The four-component
composite measure of disease progression was similar for all
bosutinib doses versus placebo. Over the treatment period,
there was no significant change in kidney function, as measured
by eGFR, with bosutinib 200 mg/d versus placebo. Observed
changes in eGFR were at least partially reversible with interrup-
tion of bosutinib treatment. TKI-induced nephrotoxicity
has been observed with imatinib, dasatinib, and nilotinib in pa-
tients with CML, but the exact mechanism for this toxicity is
unknown.16,17 It has been suggested that inhibition of platelet-
derived growth factor (PDGF) plays a role in renal injury,18 and
imatinib,19 dasatinib,20 and nilotinib21 all inhibit PDGF. In con-
trast, bosutinib has minimal to no activity against PDGF.19,20
Additional studies are needed to assess any true nephrotoxic
effects of bosutinib because, in this study and others, increased
creatinine levels after TKI treatment were reversible after awash-
out period or a cessation of/switching to another TKI, respec-
tively.17 One potential mechanism for the reversible serum
creatinine elevation observed with TKI treatment is blockade
of renal tubular secretion.22 Preclinical evidence showing TKI-
induced inhibition of renal transport proteins, organic cation
transporter, and multidrug and toxic compound extrusion pro-
teins (MATE), has been reported.23 Evidence of MATE-1/2K
inhibition has been demonstrated with tesavatinib in patients
with ADPKD24; however, whether this phenomenon applies to
bosutinib is unknown. To further understand the effects of
bosutinib on renal function, additional and/or combined
measures of renal function such as cystatin C may be of ben-
efit, especially in patients with CKD.25
The fact that eGFR data were collected at only four time
points (baseline and months 12, 24, and 25/end of initial treat-
ment) may limit interpretation. Future randomized studies
withlongerfollow-upandsuitably poweredtoassesstreatment
differences in these secondary endpoints may allow evaluation
of the association of bosutinib with renal function and disease
progression parameters in ADPKD.
RecentstudiesdemonstratethatTKVincreasesareattenuated
by rigorous blood pressure control in hypertensive patients with
ADPKD26 as well as by use of the vasopressin V2–receptor an-
tagonist tolvaptan.27,28 The phase 3 Tolvaptan Efficacy and
Safety in Management of Autosomal Dominant Polycystic Kid-
ney Disease and Its Outcomes (TEMPO) 3:4 trial demonstrated
significantly slowed kidney enlargement rate (2.8% versus 5.5%
per year; P,0.001) and significantly improved secondary out-
comes with tolvaptan versus placebo.28 The change in mean
kidney volume from baseline to the end of 3 years of tolvaptan
treatment was approximately 144 ml (50 ml/yr) smaller versus
placebo. This is in keeping with the present finding of an ap-
proximately 100-ml (50-ml/yr) smaller change in median
kidney volume from baseline to the end of 2 years of bosutinib
200-mg/d treatment versus placebo. A recent exploratory
analysis of data from the TEMPO 3:4 trial demonstrated
that increased baseline albuminuria is associated with a
more rapid loss of kidney function (eGFR) and, notably,
that tolvaptan decreased albuminuria compared with
placebo.29 This contrasts with the apparent lack of change
in proteinuria over time observed here. However, study de-
sign differences, including the larger sample size (n=1445)
and longer study treatment period (36 months) in the
TEMPO 3:4 trial, make comparisons difficult. Notably, con-
trasting with this study, patients in the TEMPO 3:4 trial were
advised to drink extra water,27 which is known to suppress
vasopressin levels.
A recent meta-analysis of preventive interventions for
ADPKD progression, including the TEMPO 3:4 trial and 29
other studies across 11 therapeutic classes (e.g., antihyperten-
sives, mammalian target of rapamycin inhibitors, somatostatin
analogs), concluded that current treatments are associated with
frequent AEs and that significant unmet need remains.3 The
observed safety profile of bosutinib was generally consistent
with that previously observed in CML trials.30 Gastrointestinal
and liver-related AEs were the most frequent toxicities; inci-
dences of diarrhea, nausea, and vomiting appeared to be dose
dependent, with frequencies being higher with bosutinib 400
and 400/200 mg/d versus bosutinib 200 mg/d and placebo.
AEs and serious AEs that could cause kidney injury were
carefully monitored throughout the study. Additional studies
are needed to determine if gastrointestinal AEs leading to
volume depletion increase risk of kidney injury. Dose reduc-
tions and continued monitoring or limited use of bosutinib
may be required to mitigate the occurrence of these AEs and
prevent adverse effects on the kidney. Of note, the frequency
of hematologic toxicities in bosutinib and placebo groups was
similar and markedly less than reported previously in the
CML setting.30
ADPKD is a slowly progressive disease and patients would
require long-term treatment. Similarly, patients with chronic
phase CML (CP CML) require treatment over several years.
Studies examining long-term (2–4 years) use of bosutinib in
patients with CP CML resistant or intolerant to prior therapy
indicate that bosutinib is well tolerated despite the high fre-
quency of diarrhea.31,32 Most diarrhea events are transient
and can be effectively managed with a combination of dose
reductions/interruptions and/or antidiarrheal medica-
tions.31,32 Long-term treatment tolerability, evidenced by
patient-reported measures of quality of life, has also been
shown in patients who received up to 5 years of treatment
with bosutinib.33 Quality of life was largely maintained,
indicating a patient’s capacity to manage their disease over
the long-term, and that the toxicity profile of bosutinib is
manageable and does not compromise quality of life. Be-
cause these studies were conducted in patients with CP

 CML resistant or intolerant to prior therapy, the results
should be interpreted cautiously and may not be applicable
to patients with ADPKD. However, they demonstrate the
tolerability and long-term effects of bosutinib treatment
in a patient population with a chronic disease.
The bosutinib exposures observed here are consistent with
those reported previously in a phase 1 trial in healthy volun-
teers.34 However, this study recruited only patients with mildly
reduced kidney function; pharmacokinetics in patients with
moderate or severe ADPKD remain to be determined. In this
regard, bosutinib exposure has been shown to be increased by
60%and 35%inpatients with severe andmoderate renaldisease,
respectively, compared with patients with normal renal func-
tion.15 In conclusion, the primary endpoint of this study was
met, with reduced kidney growth in the bosutinib 200 mg/d
versus placebo groups. Although the study was not powered
to detect treatment differences in eGFR, there was no evidence
for beneficial effects of bosutinib on eGFR versus placebo over
the 2-year treatment period. No new toxicities were identified
relative to prior experience with bosutinib in other patient
populations. The study offers evidence that Src kinase inhib-
itors may have the potential to retard the growth of cysts and
kidney volume in ADPKD but the long-term benefit remains
to be determined.
CONCISE METHODS
Study Design and Patients
This phase 2, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled study
enrolled patients at 47 study sites in 17 countries (ClinicalTrials.gov
number, NCT01233869). Eligible patients were aged 18–50 years
with a documented ADPKD diagnosis on the basis of renal ultrasound
cyst criteria per Unified Criteria for Ultrasonographic Diagnosis of
ADPKD35 or PKD1 or PKD2 genotype findings as documented in the
medical record; centrally interpreted magnetic resonance image
(MRI)–confirmed TKV$750 ml; and eGFR$60 ml/min per 1.73 m2
(additional eligibility requirements can be found in the Supplemental
Material). Patients were ineligible if they had biopsy-proven renal dis-
ease other than ADPKD or a severe acute or chronic medical condition
(e.g., liver impairment).
PatientswerestratifiedatrandomizationbybaselineTKV$750–1500ml
versus .1500 ml (central imaging reader) and were concurrently ran-
domized (1:1:1) to bosutinib 200, 400 mg/d, or placebo. Dose selection
was on the basis of a number of observations, including those from a
phase 1 study in healthy volunteers showing that these doses result in
exposures that overlap with those that elicit clinical effects in rat models
of PKD (i.e., reduction in both kidney weight and levels of activated
Src phosphorylation,34 Pfizer Inc, unpublished data); the treatment-
emergent toxicities profile from clinical studies involving patients
with advanced malignant solid tumors36 and with CML37; and the
volume of distribution of bosutinib.15
The study was approximately 50 months in duration. During the
first 24 months patients were recruited to achieve the necessary sample
size (n=140). All patients underwent a 4-week screening period. After
the screening period, patients began the initial treatment period and
received bosutinib or placebo with food once daily in the morning.
Treatment continued for up to 24 months or until ESRD onset re-
quiring dialysis for $56 days. After completion of the initial treat-
ment period, patients underwent a post-treatment assessment at
month 25 and could then continue their assigned treatment for up
to approximately 13 months in an extended treatment period.
An interim review of ongoing safety data by an independent ex-
ternal data monitoring committee approximately 1 year after the last
patient’s enrollment noted slightly increased serum creatinine levels
at month 15 and more frequent AEs with bosutinib 400 mg/d versus
placebo and bosutinib 200 mg/d (notably, gastrointestinal AEs lead-
ing to discontinuation or dose reduction). The external data mon-
itoring committee recommended a protocol amendment (October
7, 2013) to reduce bosutinib dose from 400 to 200 mg/d. Patients
were then divided between the original bosutinib 400-, 200-mg/d,
and placebo groups and an additional mixed 400/200-mg/d group
consisting of all patients originally randomized to 400 mg/d but re-
ducing to 200 mg/d.
The protocol was approved by each site’s ethics committee;
informed consent was obtained in compliance with the Declaration
of Helsinki. The authors vouch for data accuracy and adherence to
the protocol.
Endpoints
The primary efficacy endpoint was the annualized rate of kidney
enlargement versus placebo. Rationale for using TKV as a surrogate
for ADPKD progression was provided by previous studies showing a
correlation between TKV, renal cyst volume, and clinical markers of
ADPKD progression (eGFR decline, hypertension, hematuria, and
albuminuria).38–40 TKV was determined by central MRI assessment.
Key secondary endpoints included eGFR decline rate versus placebo
(using the CKD Epidemiology Collaboration equation41) and time to
first occurrence (or worsening) of clinical measures of disease pro-
gression (back and/or flank pain, hypertension, hematuria, protein-
uria, or ESRD requiring dialysis for $56 days). A four-component
composite disease progression endpoint was also assessed, including
onset/worsening of hypertension, renal pain, proteinuria, and renal
function (defined as a 25% change from baseline in reciprocal serum
creatinine levels). Efficacy analyses for TKV and eGFR were per-
formed after 24 months of treatment. Safety was assessed from
TEAEs, laboratory tests, liver function testing (including total pro-
tein, albumin, total bilirubin, direct bilirubin, lactate dehydrogenase,
alkaline phosphatase, AST, ALT), physical examinations and vital
signs, 12-lead electrocardiograms, echocardiogram, and multigated
acquisition scan. All safety analyses were performed using the initial
and post-treatment periods (frequency of assessments can be found
in the Supplemental Material). Pharmacokinetics were also assessed
from blood samples collected predose (0 hour) and postdose on days
1 (1, 3, 5, and 24 hours) and 15 (1–4, 6, 8, and 24 hours).
Statistical Analysis
The primary endpoint sample size was derived using a group sequen-
tial design with one interim analysis. On the basis of previously
reported annual rates of TKV increase (5.27% in a study by the
J Am Soc Nephrol 28: 3404–3413, 2017

CLINICAL RESEARCH
 Consortium for Radiologic Imaging Studies of Polycystic Kidney
Disease38; 5.36% in a study at the University Hospital of Zürich39), it
was assumed that the increase in TKV over a 24-month treatment
period would approach 11% in the placebo group. With an SD of 8%
for growth rate and one-sided 0.05 significance level, a sample size of
32 patients/cohort was required for 80% power to detect a clinically
meaningful reduction (50%) in the annualized rate of kidney en-
largement over 24 months in favor of bosutinib. The study was not
powered for eGFR decline rate or other secondary endpoints.
For the primary analysis, log-transformed TKV data were fit to a
longitudinal regression model. Treatment-by-time interaction was
evaluated using a global F-test (type I error 0.05); treatment effect
on annualized rate of kidney enlargement over time was evaluated
using the Wald t test. Efficacy analyses were on the basis of the mITT
population (all patients randomized receiving $2 weeks of treatment
and $1 postrandomization follow-up MRI assessment preceded by
$1-month washout) or the mITT-2 population (identical to the
mITT but without the $1-month washout), which are consistent
with a per-protocol analysis. Missing efficacy data were imputed
using a longitudinal linear mixed model. Time to first event occur-
rence corresponded to the duration from randomization to first oc-
currence of that event in a treatment group. Safety was assessed in all
patients receiving $1 study dose.
