INTRODUCTION
The World Health Organization (WHO) suggests that by 
2030 deaths from non- 
communicable diseases (NCD) would 
have risen markedly globally to be the number one cause of 
death.1 Examples of high- 
prevalence NCDs are type 2 dia-
betes, obesity and cardiovascular disease (CVD) which are 
also partly interconnected. For example, obesity is associated 
with several diseases such as CVD, stroke, hypertension, type 
2 diabetes, osteoporosis, and cancer.2,3 Childhood obesity is

We evaluated effects of the school- 
based intervention “FIFA 11 for Health” for 
Europe on health and fitness profile in 10- 
 to 12- 
year- 
old Faroese schoolchildren. 
392 fifth- 
grade children were randomized into a control group (CG: n = 100, 
11.1 ± 0.3 years, 149.0 ± 6.7 cm, 42.4 ± 10.2 kg) and an intervention group (IG: 
n = 292, 11.1 ± 0.3 years, 150.6 ± 6.9 cm, 44.2 ± 9.4 kg). IG underwent an 11- 
week intervention in which 2 weekly sessions of 45 minutes were included in the 
school curriculum focusing on health aspects, football skills, and 3v3 small- 
sided 
games. CG continued with their regular activities. Body composition, blood pres-
sure, and resting heart rate, as well as Yo- 
Yo intermittent recovery children’s test 
(YYIR1C) performance, horizontal jumping ability and postural balance were as-
sessed pre and post intervention. Systolic blood pressure decreased more (−2.8 ± 9.9 
vs 2.9 ± 8.4 mm Hg, P < .05) in IG than in CG. Lean body mass (1.0 ± 1.7 vs 
0.7 ± 1.6 kg), postural balance (0.3 ± 3.9 vs −1.2 ± 5.9 seconds) and horizontal 
jump performance (5 ± 9 vs -5 ± 10 cm) increased more (P < .05) in IG than in CG. 
YYIR1C performance improved in CG (17%, 625 ± 423 to 730 ± 565 m) and IG 
(18%, 689 ± 412 vs 813 ± 391 m), but without between- 
group differences. A within- 
group decrease from 23.1 ± 8.4 to 22.5 ± 8.3% (P < .05) was observed in body fat 
percentage in IG only. In conclusion, the “FIFA 11 for Health” for Europe program 
had beneficial effects on SBP, body composition, jump performance and postural 
balance in 10- 
 to 12- 
year- 
old Faroese schoolchildren, supporting the notion that 
school- 
based football interventions can facilitate health of children in a small- 
scale 
society and serve as an early step in the prevention of non- 
communicable diseases.

primarily caused by a lack of physical activity combined with 
an unhealthy and high energy diet,3 and being obese during 
childhood can increase the risks of developing NCDs in adult 
life.4-7 In addition, living location and gender may have a sig-
nificant influence on the physical health of children due to 
differences in eating habits, amount of physical activity and 
access to sports facilities.8
Six major risk factors for developing CVD have been 
highlighted in previous school sport studies, that is, resting 
blood pressure, body fat percentage, aerobic fitness, tri-
glycerides, cholesterol, and plasma insulin.4-7,9 In this study, 
3 of these 6 major CVD risk factors were investigated (resting 
blood pressure, body fat percentage, and aerobic fitness). It 
has been shown that regular physical activity can reduce the 
risk of developing overweight, CVD, and type 2 diabetes.1,10 
When it comes to sport, team sports such as football are ex-
tremely popular, and studies have demonstrated beneficial 
effects of regular team- 
sport participation on health profile 
and CVD risk in children, including positive alterations in 
blood pressure and aerobic fitness,11-13 as well as body fat 
percentage, blood lipids and plasma insulin in some14 but 
not all studies.15,16 As team sports have been shown to in-
duce broad- 
spectrum physical benefits in children,12,13,15,16 
it is essential to use fitness assessments representing endur-
ance, strength, and postural balance in evaluation of team 
sports interventions.
A number of health projects and campaigns have been ini-
tiated to address the issues associated with CVDs and NCDs, 
and to educate children about health, hygiene and the im-
portance of physical activity.1 The Fédération Internationale 
de Football Association (FIFA) developed a program using 
football- 
based exercises to educate children about health, hy-
giene, and contamination, and to introduce regular physical 
activity in order for children to gain from the benefits of foot-
ball practice.1,17,18
In 2015, Denmark was the first country in Europe to im-
plement the “FIFA 11 for Health” program. The program 
was modified to meet the health demands of the western 
world, with a primary focus on reducing the risk of devel-
oping NCDs.13,17 The modifications in the physical section 
of the program were based on studies of football- 
based exer-
cises showing that 6- 
 to 16- 
week interventions involving two 
weekly sessions, lasting 30- 
60 minutes, of football exercises 
and 3v3 games, improved the physical health of children 
and adults.19-21 The modifications in the education section 
were focused on the themes of physical activity, nutrition, 
hygiene, and alcohol and tobacco consumption. The educa-
tion also covered wellbeing in school, respect and a positive 
mindset.13
The “FIFA 11 for Health” in Europe protocol consists of 
2 × 45- 
minutes interactive football sessions per week over 
11 weeks, with the two weekly 45- 
minutes sessions carried 
out at least 2 days apart. The first session is deemed “Play 
Football” and teaches football skills, while the second ses-
sion is called “Play Fair” and emphasizes health education 
through active football training.1 Both sessions include small- 
sided games, which aims to be the main physical stimulus of 
the intervention. The original European “FIFA 11 for Health” 
initiative, implemented in Denmark, demonstrated improved 
cardiovascular and metabolic health profile.13 Furthermore, 
the intervention markedly increased the children’s health 
knowledge.17 In support of this, initiatives in Africa and 
Latin American also significantly increased health knowl-
edge. However, the physical effects of the program were not 
evaluated in these regions.1,22,23 It is, however, unknown how 
children in a small- 
scale society will respond to the “FIFA 11 
for Health” program.
The aim of this study was to examine the effect of in-
troducing the “FIFA 11 for Health” in Europe program in 
schools in the Faroe Islands, a European small- 
scale society 
in the middle of the North Atlantic Ocean, on blood pressure, 
body composition, and fitness. We hypothesized that the in-
tervention would promote physical health and fitness profile 
irrespective of gender.

METHODS
2.1 | Participants
Fourteen schools in the Faroe Islands were contacted by 
the researchers based on the inclusion criterion of having at 
least one  
fifth- 
grade class with >15 students. Due to logisti-
cal challenges, two schools were excluded and 12 schools 
agreed to participate. Of the participating schools, six were 
located in the central region (the capital), four in the northern 
countryside and two in the western countryside. The trial was 
cluster- 
randomized, with each school representing a cluster, 
and block randomization was performed to obtain at least one 
representative from the central region and the countryside in 
the intervention (IG) and control (CG) groups, respectively. 
IG consisted of nine schools; five from the capital region, 
two from the northern countryside and two from the western 
countryside. The remaining schools, one from the capital re-
gion and two from the countryside, comprised CG. 23 classes 
consisting of 15- 
25 students aged 10- 
12 years participated. 
Altogether, 491 children were eligible for the study (252

boys, 239 girls) and 392 individuals (203 boys, 189 girls) 
completed both pre- 
 and post- 
testing (see study flowchart, 
Figure 1). Thirty- 
three of the 392 children did not complete 
the full test battery, but they completed both pre- 
 and post- 
testing in the partial tests. These children are included in the 
results (Table 1). Written consent was obtained from both 
parents/guardians after they had received written and verbal 
information about the study according to the Declaration of 
Helsinki. The study was approved by the ethical committee 
of the Faroe Islands.
2.2 | Design
The intervention period lasted from January to June 2017. 
The duration of the intervention was 13 weeks; weeks 0- 
12. 
In week 0, IG and CG completed the pre- 
tests. In weeks 1- 
11, 
IG performed the “FIFA 11 for Health” in Europe program 
(two 45- 
minutes sessions per week). The intervention ses-
sions were conducted during normal school- 
time. The indi-
vidual schools decided in which lessons (eg, math or english) 
the two weekly intervention sessions were performed (not in 
the weekly PE sessions, which were maintained as normal). 
CG continued their normal curriculum during the interven-
tion period. Thus, both IG and CG continued to take their 
normal PE classes during the intervention. In week 12, post- 
testing was carried out for both IG and CG. Pre- 
 and post- 
testing were identical and were conducted by the same test 
leader at the same time of day. Prior to the start of the study 
period, two teachers from each class took part in a two- 
day 
“FIFA 11 for Health” instructor course and received a di-
ploma and a teaching manual containing information about 
the program and detailed descriptions of each session as well 
as information sheets and assignments.
2.3 | “FIFA 11 for Health” in Europe
The “FIFA 11 for Health” program is an 11- 
week educa-
tion program for children aged 10- 
12 years based on football 
practice and health education.13,17 In this study, the aim of the 
program was to incorporate physical activity in the Faroese 
public education system and to improve physical fitness and 
general health knowledge. The program lasted 11 weeks, 
with two weekly sessions (2 × 45 minutes). The first session 
of a week, called “Play Football,” used football- 
based games 
and activities to teach the children football skills, teamwork, 
and respect. The second session of a week, called “Play Fair,” 
taught the children about physical health through football- 
related activities as an alternative to chalkboard teaching. 
Small- 
sided games (3v3, 4v4) were included in every ses-
sion, and aimed to be the main physical stimulus, based on 
previous research.24
2.4 | Test battery
The test protocol consisted of measurements of body compo-
sition (height, weight, body fat percentage), blood pressure 
and resting heart rate, postural balance, horizontal jumping 
performance, and Yo- 
Yo intermittent recovery children’s test 
(YYIR1C) performance (see Ørntoft et al).13 All tests were 
carried out on the same day in the same order. Firstly, the 
participants were divided into groups of 6- 
7, one group start-
ing with body composition measurements, the balance test 
and the jumping test, and the other group with blood pres-
sure measurements. After completing one station, the groups 
rotated so that all participants performed all tests. Lastly, the 
YYIR1C test was performed for the entire class at the same 
time. The participants were instructed to refrain from strenu-
ous exercise the day prior to the experimental testing.

Amsterdam, Netherlands). The participants stood barefoot 
with heels against the wall looking straight forward. Body 
weight, fat percentage, and lean body mass were measured 
with an InBody 230 multi- 
frequency body composition ana-
lyser (Biospace, California, USA) as described by Karelis 
et al.5 Body composition measurements were performed 
in the morning (08.00- 
09.00 o’clock) after a light break-
fast. The participants were weighed barefoot wearing light 
clothes. The data output, as calculated by an algorithm, in-
cluded fat mass (kg), body fat (%), and lean body mass (kg). 
The InBody technology has been validated with dual- 
energy 
X- 
ray absorptiometry (DXA) on primary schoolchildren 
with interclass correlation coefficients (ICC) for fat percent-
age and lean mass of 0.94- 
0.99, and on adults with ICCs of 
0.98-0.99.5,13
2.6 | Blood pressure and resting heart rate
The participants rested on a soft mat in a quiet and dark 
room for 15- 
20 minutes before assessment, with a teacher or 
test leader present to avoid noise and disturbances. Systolic 
blood pressure (SBP), diastolic blood pressure (DBP), and 
resting heart rate (RHR) were measured according to stand-
ard procedures using an automatic BP monitor (HEM- 
709; 
OMRON, IL, USA).25 Mean arterial pressure (MAP) was 
calculated as 1/3 SBP + 2/3 DBP. Measurements were per-
formed three consecutive times on the upper left arm. The 
average of the three measurements was used as the final 
score for SBP and DBP, and the lowest recording as RHR.
2.7 | Postural balance test
The postural balance was assessed by the use of the Standing 
Stork Balance Test.26 The participants placed their hands 
on their waist and stood on their preferred leg with the op-
posite foot resting on the knee of the standing leg with the 
knee pointing laterally from the standing leg. When the 
participants lifted their heel from the floor to balance on 
the ball of the foot, the test leader started a stop- 
watch. The 
time was stopped if the heel touched the floor, if one or both 
hands left the waist, or if the foot left the knee. The test 
was performed three consecutive times on the same leg for 
each participant on the floor of the classroom or gym. The 
participants were allowed one familiarization try on each 
leg prior to the test. The Standing Stork Balance Test has 
been proven reliable and correlates (r = .65, P < .001) to 
more conventional balance tests, such as the Flamingo test, 
and is considered valid as a clinical tool to measure static 
balance.26
2.8 | Horizontal jumping test
Horizontal jumping performance was assessed according to 
Ørntoft et al.13 A tape measure was stretched out on the floor 
with a clear starting mark. The participants placed their feet 
behind the start, put their hands on their waist and adopted 
a squatting position for at least 2 seconds (akimbo). The 
participants jumped as far as possible, landing on both feet 
without the hands leaving the waist. The distance from the 
start to where the rear heel landed was recorded as the result. 
The participants performed two consecutive jumps, with the 
longest jump noted as the test result. The participants were 
allowed a familiarization try before the test, as previously de-
scribed.13 The jumping test was performed immediately after 
the postural balance test.
2.9 | Yo- 
Yo intermittent recovery children’s 
running test (YYIR1C)
The YYIR1C test was performed indoors on a wooden floor 
after a fixed warm- 
up protocol as previously described.27–29 
Two markers were placed at each end of a 16- 
m running track. 
The participants performed running intervals of 2 × 16 m at 
a speed dictated by a beeping signal, separated by a recovery

period of 10 seconds in which the participants jogged around 
a marker placed 4 m behind the start and back to the start (see 
Ahler et al).29 As the test progressed, the speed increased. 
The children ended the test when they were unable to keep up 
with the beeping signals and the result was noted according 
to normal procedures for Yo- 
Yo tests.30 The test continued 
until all children failed to maintain the required pace. The 
test duration ranged from 2 to 12 minutes. The YYIR1C test 
has been demonstrated to have a moderate reproducibility 
(CV = 13%).31
2.10 | Statistics
Data are presented as means (±SD) unless otherwise stated. 
Change scores were calculated as the difference between pre 
and post measurements. A two- 
factor mixed ANOVA design 
with the between factor “group” (IG vs CG) and repeated factor 
“condition” (pre- 
training vs post- 
training) was used to analyze 
all data, except the gender effect. The gender effects were ana-
lyzed with a three- 
factor mixed model ANOVA (IG v CG*pre 
v post*boys v girls). When significant interactions or main ef-
fects were detected, data were subsequently analyzed using 
Bonferroni post hoc t tests. Significance was accepted at P < .05.

RESULTS
3.1 | Resting blood pressure and heart rate
At baseline, SBP was higher (P < .05) in IG than in CG 
(Table 2). SBP decreased (P < .05) 2.8 mm Hg in IG, while 
there was an increase (P < .05) in CG, with a 5.7 mm Hg 
greater (group- 
condition interaction) change score in IG 
compared to CG (Table 2). No significant change was ob-
served in DBP or MAP for either IG or CG. Resting HR 
decreased (P < .05) in CG with no change in IG, and no sig-
nificant group- 
condition interaction.
3.2 | Body composition
At baseline, body height and LBM were higher (P < .05) 
in IG than in CG (Table 3). Body height increased more 
(P < .05; group- 
condition interaction) in IG than in CG dur-
ing the intervention period. LBM increased (P < .05) in IG 
and CG during the intervention, but with a 0.4 kg greater 
(P < .05; group- 
condition interaction) change in IG com-
pared to GC (Table 4). Total body mass increased (P < .05) in 
both groups, but with a tendency (P = .06) for greater change 
score (1.0 kg P < .05) in IG than in CG (Table 4). BMI in-
creased (P < .05) in both IG and CG, with no between- 
group 
differences. Body fat decreased (P < .05) in IG only, but the 
decrease was not significantly different from CG (Table 4).
3.3 | Physical performance
At baseline, horizontal jumping and postural balance per-
formance were higher (P < .05) in CG than in IG (Table 5). 
Postural balance performance increased (P < .05) by 6.8% 
in IG and decreased (P < .05) in CG, with a 1.5 seconds 
between- 
group difference (P < .05; group- 
condition in-
teraction) (Table 2). Horizontal jump performance was

improved (P < .05) by 10 cm in IG compared to CG 
(Table 2). Both groups improved their Yo- 
Yo IR1C test 
performance (P < .05), with no between- 
group difference 
(Table 5).
3.4 | Gender- 
specific effects
Baseline performance in horizontal jumping and postural 
balance was higher (P < .05) in CG girls than in IG girls 
(Table 6). Height, total body weight, and LBM increased 
more (P < .05; gender- 
group- 
condition interaction) in 
IG girls than in CG girls. Furthermore, SBP decreased 
more (P < .05; gender- 
group- 
condition interaction) 
in IG girls than in CG girls (−5.2 mm Hg; Table 6). 
Horizontal jumping performance (13 cm) and postural 
balance (2.1 s) also increased more (P < .05; gender- 
group- 
condition) in IG girls than in CG girls (Table 6). 
Finally, Yo- 
Yo IR1C performance increased (P < .05) in 
both groups of girls, with no significant between- 
group 
difference (Table 6).
In boys, baseline LBM and MAP were higher (P < .05) in 
IG than in CG, and baseline performance in horizontal jump-
ing and postural balance was higher (P < .05) in CG than in IG 
boys (Table 6). For the boys, height increased more (P < .05; 
gender- 
group- 
condition) in IG than in CG. Body fat percent-
age decreased (P < .05) in the IG- 
boys, but there was no sig-
nificant between- 
group (Table 6) difference. LBM increased 
(P < .05) in both groups of boys, with no significant between- 
group differences (Table 6). SBP decreased (P < .05) in IG 
and increased (P < .05) in CG with a between- 
group change 
(P < .05; gender- 
group- 
condition) of −6.3 mm Hg (Table 6). 
Yo- 
Yo IR1C performance increased (P < .05) in both groups of 
boys, with no significant between- 
group differences (Table 6).
LBM, BMI, and body mass increased more (P < .05; gender- 
group- 
condition) during the intervention in girls than in boys 
(Table 6). No other gender- 
specific differences were observed.

DISCUSSION
The principal findings of the present study were that the 
“FIFA 11 for Health” for Europe program lowered SBP, 
improved postural balance and jump performance and in-
creased lean body mass. No changes were observed in rest-
ing heart rate. Intermittent running performance increased 
significantly in both groups during the intervention. Finally, 
the study showed some gender- 
specific adaptations to the 
intervention.
Systolic blood pressure decreased by ~6 mm Hg in IG 
compared to CG, whereas no changes were observed in 
DBP, MAP, and RHR. This decrease in SBP in the present 
study is similar to or even larger than reported in other com-
parable training studies for children aged 9- 
13 using inter-
vention periods of 10 weeks to 2 years, for example, −1 to 
−4 mm Hg.13,20,32 The decrease in SBP was evident in both

genders, which beneficial effects on blood pressure in nor-
motensive boys and girls. A reduction in SBP of 6 mm Hg 
is considered clinically relevant in adults, with an estimated 
13% reduction in cardiovascular mortality and morbidity for 
every 5 mm Hg reduction in SBP.25 Despite a lack of similar 
risk assessments in children, this response, if sustained into 
adulthood, has great beneficial cardiovascular health effects. 
In the present study, we did not measure physiological pa-
rameters of importance for SBP except body fat percentage, 
but previous RCTs applying small- 
sided football training to 
adults have demonstrated decreased arterial stiffness, im-
proved blood lipid profile, increased muscle capillarization 
as well as lowered body fat mass.19–21,33–35 Together, it ap-
pears that this type of short- 
term football interventions are 
effective in improving the cardiovascular health profile for 
children as well as adults.
Postural balance also improved in IG compared to CG. 
This effect was hypothesized prior to the study based on other 
studies examining postural balance after football- 
based train-
ing interventions lasting 12- 
14 weeks36,37 and 16 months.34 
The adaptive changes in the somatosensory system and in-
creased strength in lower- 
limb bone and muscle may have 
led to the improved postural balance.36,38 This was supported 
by an increase in horizontal jump performance of 10 cm in 
IG compared to CG. Other comparable intervention studies 
lasting 11- 
12 weeks13,39 found no significant effects on jump 
performance. In contrast, a 6- 
month intervention15 demon-
strated increases in jumping distance, and a 10- 
month inter-
vention comprising 3 × 40 minutes per week of small- 
sided 
games for 8- to 10-year-old children have shown an increase 
in both postural balance and jump test performance.12
In the present study, there was no between- 
group change 
in either body fat percentage or BMI between IG and CG 
after the intervention period. These findings are in accor-
dance with other studies on school- 
based activity with in-
terventions ranging from 6 weeks to 6 years.20,32,40,41 In 
these studies, it was proposed that the exercise intensity 
is of greater importance than the total amount of physical 
activity. A lack of intensity in the sessions can, therefore, 
be suggested to have played a role in the unchanged body 
fat content. However, the difference in sexual maturity and 
growth is a major factor in studies involving prepubertal 
children. Thus, the lack of changes may also be associated 
with the natural growth and maturity process of the chil-
dren. Height, total body weight, and LBM increased sig-
nificantly in both IG and CG, but with a greater change 
score in IG for height and LBM. Thus, the larger increase 
in height may partly be associated with an advanced matu-
rity in the children in the IG group. However, the increase 
in LBM could additionally indicate muscle hypertrophy as 
a result of additional exercise.12,35 The girls in IG had a sig-
nificantly larger increase in LBM compared to the IG- 
boys, 
which may be associated with an accelerated biological 
maturity in girls compared to boys. However, these gender 
differences were not present in CG. Furthermore, body fat 
percentage in the IG- 
boys decreased, whereas it was un-
changed in the IG- 
girls. According to questionnaires (data 
not shown) that the participants were asked to complete 
prior to the intervention, 51% of the boys and 49% of the 
girls were physically active in their leisure- 
time. Thus, the 
superior LBM increase in girls and the greater decrease 
in body fat percentage in boys are likely to be associated 
with advanced maturity, predominately in the girls, com-
bined with the “FIFA 11 for Health” intervention, and not 
due to different responses to the physical exercise in their 
leisure- 
time.
Yo- 
Yo IR1C performance increased 18% in IG and 17% in 
CG during the intervention period, with no between- 
group dif-
ference. Other studies have reported similar effects of small- 
sided football games on Yo- 
Yo IR1C performance in children 
after 6 weeks42 and 10 months,12 but in contrast the present 
study showed no change compared to the control group as in 
studies by Bendiksen et al42 and Larsen et al12 Studies have 
shown that high- 
intensity football training is associated with 
aerobic intermittent high- 
intensity exercise capacity, and that 
high- 
intensity training can be efficient at improving aerobic 
exercise in adolescents and adults.31,43,44 In the present study, 
the exercise intensity of the football training sessions was not 
assessed. Thus, we cannot rule out that the exercise intensity 
was too low to result in major improvements in the endurance 
capacity of the children. A limitation of the study in relation 
to the YYIR1C test is the lack of a familiarization trial prior 
to baseline testing, albeit other studies have shown that no 
familiarization is needed in this test.29
There is limited research on the physical health status 
of Faroese children. The Faroe Islands have only 50 000 
inhabitants and are geographically isolated in the middle of 
the North Atlantic Ocean. For the first time, a vast majority 
of the children aged 10- 
12 years in a small- 
scale society 
have been studied in relation to health and fitness profile, 
as well as the impact of an exercise and health- 
teaching 
intervention performed in a school setting. The intervention 
was added to the PE sessions and based on the novel results 
of the present investigation, the “FIFA 11 for Health” 
program is an effective way of promoting health in respect 
of three major risk factors for developing CVD in this type 
of society. However, future research should aim to provide 
data on diet and exercise intensity to give more accurate and 
detailed results.
One limitation of the study was that nine schools were 
included as intervention schools and only three as control 
schools. Even though the randomization procedure was car-
ried out as block randomization, making sure that one control 
group was included from each of the three geographical clus-
ters, some baseline differences were observed between the 
intervention group and the control group.

In conclusion, the results of the present study confirmed 
the hypothesis that the “FIFA 11 for Health” program, 
based on football training and 3v3 games, would improve 
fitness and physical health of children aged 10- 
12 years. 
Thus, this type of high- 
intensity interval exercise training 
is suggested to be incorporation in the school curriculum in 
all classes to improve physical health and reduce the risk of 
developing NCDs.
4.1 | Perspectives
The present study emphasizes that “FIFA 11 for Health” 
in Europe can be used as a tool to improve physical health 
profile of children aged 10- 
12 years in a small- 
scale is-
lands society. Thus, team sports organized as small- 
sided 
high- 
intensity games in combination with health educa-
tion can be included in the school curriculum to improve 
fitness and health profile and to contribute the prevention 
of non- 
communicable diseases. The “FIFA 11 for Health” 
in Europe sessions are conducted by schoolteachers and the 
sessions were easily incorporated in the Faroese school sys-
tem. Moreover, the structure of the sessions requires mini-
mal use of resources and space and allows sessions to be 
conducted outside or inside in small areas, therefore it would 
be easy to implement in other small- 
scale countries.
