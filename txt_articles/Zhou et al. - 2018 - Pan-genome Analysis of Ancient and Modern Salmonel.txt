SUMMARY
Salmonella enterica serovar Paratyphi C causes
enteric (paratyphoid) fever in humans. Its presenta-
tion can range from asymptomatic infections of the
blood stream to gastrointestinal or urinary tract
infection or even a fatal septicemia [1]. Paratyphi C
is very rare in Europe and North America except for
occasional travelers from South and East Asia or
Africa, where the disease is more common [2, 3].
However, early 20th-century observations in Eastern
Europe [3, 4] suggest that Paratyphi C enteric fever
may once have had a wide-ranging impact on human
societies. Here, we describe a draft Paratyphi C
genome (Ragna) recovered from the 800-year-old
skeleton (SK152) of a young woman in Trondheim,
Norway. Paratyphi C sequences were recovered
from her teeth and bones, suggesting that she died
of enteric fever and demonstrating that these bacte-
ria have long caused invasive salmonellosis in
Europeans. Comparative analyses against modern
Salmonella genome sequences revealed that Paraty-
phi C is a clade within the Para C lineage, which
also includes serovars Choleraesuis, Typhisuis, and
Lomita. Although Paratyphi C only infects humans,
Choleraesuis causes septicemia in pigs and boar
[5] (and occasionally humans), and Typhisuis causes
epidemic swine salmonellosis (chronic paratyphoid)
in domestic pigs [2, 3]. These different host specific-
ities likely evolved in Europe over the last �4,000
years since the time of their most recent common
ancestor (tMRCA) and are possibly associated with
the differential acquisitions of two genomic islands,
SPI-6 and SPI-7. The tMRCAs of these bacterial
clades coincide with the timing of pig domestication
in Europe [6].
RESULTS AND DISCUSSION
According to historical records [7], humans have long been
afflicted by bacterial infections, yet genomic analyses of extant
bacterial pathogens routinely estimate a tMRCA of no more
than a few centuries [8]. In general, evolutionary trees contain a
stem group, which may include lineages that are now rare or
extinct, as well as the crown group of extant organisms. Histor-
ical reconstructions based only on the crown group ignore the
older sub-lineages in the stem group and thereby provide an
incomplete picture of the older evolutionary history of the
pathogen. In contrast, analyses of ancient DNA (aDNA) can
shed light on additional millennia of bacterial pathogen evolution
that occurred prior to the origin of the crown group [9, 10]. We
therefore searched for ancient bacterial lineages by scanning
metagenomic sequences from teeth and long bones of 33
skeletons who were buried between 1100 and 1670 CE in Trond-
heim, Norway [11] (Figures 1A and 1C).
SK152 is the skeleton of a 19- to 24-year-old woman of 154 ±
3 cm height who was buried in 1200 ± 50 CE, according to
archaeological investigations [11]. Calibrated radiocarbon (14C)
dating of two teeth estimated her burial as 100–200 years earlier
(Figure S1B); this minor discrepancy may reflect the reservoir
effect on radiocarbon dating from a predominant diet of fish
products [13]. Based on d18Ocarbon isotopic measurements
from her first and third molars, this woman likely migrated from
the northernmost inland areas of Scandinavia or Northwest

 Russia during her childhood and arrived in Trondheim by her
early teens [14] (Figure S1A). The skeleton rested on a wooden
plank (a symbolic coffin) in a grave filled and covered with
anoxic, acidic, and waterlogged wood chips and soil (Figure 1B).
Metagenomic Reads Associated with SK152
We identified 266 Salmonella enterica sequence reads in one
tooth from skeleton SK152 and many more Salmonella se-
quences from additional libraries from SK152 teeth and bone,
but not from dental calculus (Table 1). We attempted to recon-
struct this Salmonella genome (henceforth designated ‘‘Ragna’’)
from the SK152 sequence libraries. Concoct [12] was able to
reconstitute 11 near-complete microbial genomes from those
data (Figure 1D). Nine of these genomes likely reflect recent
soil contamination because their 50-single-stranded deamination
rates were low [15], with DNA damage < 0.22, versus values of
0.47 for human DNA and 0.9 for Ragna.
The two other assembled genomes exhibited high levels of
DNA damage and are thus likely to have been endogenous to
this corpse since burial. Genome C72, from a novel species of
Eubacterium, was found almost exclusively in dental calculus,
and these bacteria may have been a component of a biofilm
associated with periodontal disease, as are other Eubacterium
species [16]. Genome C18 belongs to Acidovorax, which is asso-
ciated with plant pathogens [17] and may have been introduced
with the wood chips that covered the skeleton. We therefore
decided to reconstruct the Ragna genome by read mapping
against its close relatives within S. enterica.
The Para C Lineage
Identifying close relatives of the Ragna genome required an
overview of the genetic diversity of S. enterica subspecies enter-
ica. To this end, we inferred phylogenetic trees of 2,964 genomes
that represented the diversity of 50,000 strains of S. enterica
in EnteroBase [18]. These contained 711,009 single-nucleotide
polymorphisms
(SNPs)
in
3,002
core
genes
(2.8
Mb).
A maximum-likelihood tree of the concatenated core genes
revealed the existence of multiple, discrete lineages (Figure 2A).
The initial sequence reads from Ragna were most closely related
to one of these lineages, the ‘‘Para C lineage.’’ The Para C line-
age is comprised of monophyletic clades of serovars Paratyphi
C, Choleraesuis, and Typhisuis, which were already known to
be related by lower resolution analyses [3], plus one genome of
the extremely rare serovar Lomita (Figure 2). Paratyphi C only
infects humans, but serovar Choleraesuis is associated with
septicemia in swine (and occasionally humans) and Typhisuis
is associated with epidemic swine salmonellosis (chronic paraty-
phoid) in domestic pigs [2, 3]. Although these other serovars
continue to cause disease in southern and eastern Asia, Choler-
aesuis is rare in Europe today except in wild boar [5], and
Typhisuis has been eradicated from European pigs. For our
further phylogenetic analyses, we included two genomes of
serovar Birkenhead as an outgroup because they were the
closest genetic relatives of the Para C lineage (Figure 2).
Reliable inference of the evolutionary timescale and phylogeo-
graphic history of the Para C lineage depends on a broad tempo-
ral and spatial range of sources for the bacterial strains. How-
ever, EnteroBase only contained 100 Salmonella genomes
from the Para C lineage, and they were of limited geographical
and temporal diversity. We therefore combed the strain collec-
tion at the Institut Pasteur, Paris, and sequenced 119 additional
Para-C-lineage
genomes from diverse, historical sources.
Our
final
dataset
comprised
219
modern
Para-C-lineage
genomes, isolated between 1914 and 2015 from multiple conti-
nents (Table S1).
A maximum-likelihood tree of the core SNPs within the 219 ge-
nomes showed that they fell into well-defined sub-lineages
within each serovar (Paratyphi C: PC-1, PC-2; Choleraesuis:
CS Kunzendorf, CS sensu stricto, CS-3; Typhisuis: TS-1, TS-2)
(Figure 2B). We also calculated a pan-genome, which was
used to map the SK152 metagenomic reads after initial process-
ing and de-duplication. Mapping identified 1,030,108 unique
Salmonella reads in teeth (0.05%–0.18% of all reads) or the
femur (0.01%), but not in dental calculus (Table 1). All of these
reads were specific to Paratyphi C and covered 98.4% of a refer-
ence Paratyphi C genome (RKS4594) with a mean read depth of
7.3-fold (Table 1). To avoid spurious SNP calls associated with
DNA damage, we only called SNPs in the Ragna genome that
were covered by at least two reads, resulting in 95% coverage
of RKS4594 (Figure S2).

 Our data demonstrate that Paratyphi C bacteria caused hu-
man infections in Norway 800 years ago, and their presence in
both teeth and bones suggests that SK152 died of septicemia
associated with enteric fever. Paratyphi C aDNA from 1,545 CE
has also been recently described from mass graves in Mexico
[19], consistent with a continuous history of systemic human dis-
ease associated with this pathogen.
Pan-genomic Stability
The selective pressures associated with local ecological interac-
tions are thought to cause variation of gene content in microbes
[20]. We therefore anticipated that 800 years of evolution would
have resulted in dramatic differences in gene content between
Ragna and modern Paratyphi C genomes, and we expected
even greater differences between Paratyphi C and the other
clades of the Para C lineage. Surprisingly, 78% of the 4,388 ±
99 genes (total length 4.8 ± 0.08 Mb) in a Para-C-lineage genome
were intact core genes, and only 604 core SNPs distinguished
Ragna from the MRCA of modern Paratyphi C (Figure 3). Some
core genes are universally present in the Para C lineage plus
Birkenhead even though they belong to mobile genetic elements
that are variably present in other Salmonella, e.g., the pathoge-
nicity islands SPI-1 to SPI-6, SPI-9, and SPI-11 to SPI-14 (Fig-
ure 2B). Similarly, the virulence plasmid was present throughout
the Para C lineage except for Typhisuis sub-lineage TS-2.
A further constant feature of the Para C lineage was the absence
of genes encoding typhoid toxin, which is thought to trigger
enteric fever by serovars Typhi and Paratyphi A [21].
Other studies have indicated that microbial host adaptation is
accompanied by the accumulation of pseudogenes [22], driven
by the streamlining of genes that are no longer necessary for
the infection of multiple hosts [23], or by rewiring of transcrip-
tional regulation [24]. The 2,964 representative Salmonella
genomes contained a median of 40–60 pseudogenes. The
numbers of pseudogenes were unexceptional for the most
recent common ancestors (MRCAs) of the Para C lineage (25
pseudogenes) or of Paratyphi C, Choleraesuis plus Typhisuis
(69 pseudogenes) (Figure S3C), suggesting that neither of these
MRCAs was adapted to any particular host. However, the
MRCAs of the individual serovars may well mark the beginnings
of host adaptation because they were associated with higher
numbers of pseudogenes (Choleraesuis: 95; Paratyphi C: 116;
Typhisuis: 181). These pseudogenes may simply represent func-
tions that are not required for infection of their individual hosts or
may even have contributed to host specificity.
We also attempted to identify mobile genetic elements in the
accessory genome of the Para C lineage that could account
for their differential host specificities. The 3,901 accessory genes
clustered together within 227 GIs (genomic islands and other
mobile elements), including 37 plasmids, 32 prophages, 16
IMEs (integrative and mobilizable elements), SPI-5 to SPI-7,
and two ICEs (integrative and conjugative elements) (Table S2).
Parts or all of these GIs were acquired or lost on 311 independent
occasions. However, at least 60% of gains or losses are unlikely
to be important for host specificity because they were restricted
to a single genome (Table S2), and most gains or losses were
very recent (Figure S3B). Most of the other gains or losses are
also unlikely to represent successful evolutionary changes in
virulence or host specificity because, as in other Salmonella
[25–27], they were restricted to individual sub-lineages, and
sister sub-lineages differing in the possession of those genes
are also prevalent in invasive disease (Figure 2B). For example,
Paratyphi C is more virulent for mice after lysogenization up-
stream of pgtE by a P22-like prophage, SCP-P1 [28] (here
GI076), whose gene product prevents opsonization [29]. How-
ever, GI076 is absent from half of the Paratyphi C genomes,
including Ragna (Figure 2B). Similarly, the fimH102 allele of a
type 1 fimbrial adhesin facilitates specific adhesion to porcine
cells by serovar Choleraesuis [30], but fimH is totally lacking in
CS sensu stricto. Indeed, none of the inferred virulence factors
and GIs seemed likely to be consistently related to differential
virulence or host specificity (Table S3), with the notable excep-
tions of SPI-7 and SPI-6.
SPI-7 (GI107) is a pathogenicity island which encodes the
Vi capsular polysaccharide in serovars Typhi, Paratyphi C
(including Ragna), and Dublin. Vi might promote enteric fever in
humans because it prevents the opsonization and clearance
that is triggered by binding of the C3 component of complement
to lipopolysaccharide [31]. The presence of SPI-7 in all Paratyphi
C, and its absence from all Typhisuis and Choleraesuis, suggests

 that SPI-7 was acquired prior to the expansion of serovar Para-
typhi C and also suggests an association with its human speci-
ficity. A 5-gene deletion within SPI-7 is present throughout
sub-lineage PC-1, but this does not affect the production of Vi
polysaccharide [3].
SPI-6 (GI008) is present throughout the Para C lineage. It
encodes a type-6 secretion system (T6SS), as well as Salmonella
atypical fimbriae (saf) and Typhi colonization factor (tcf) (Fig-
ure S4). T6SS systems encode intracellular, inverted bacterio-
phage-tail-like structures that can inject lethal effectors (TaeX)
into neighboring eukaryotic and bacterial cells [32]. SPI-6 con-
tributes to the gastrointestinal colonization and pathogenesis
of mice [33] and chickens [34] by serovar Typhimurium. Expres-
sion of tcf resulted in specific adhesion of Escherichia coli to
human epithelial cells [35], and saf mutations reduced gastroin-
testinal colonization of pigs by serovar Choleraesuis [36]. The tcf
and saf genes are variably present within SPI-6 in the multiple
serovars within the Para C lineage (Figure S4) and might there-
fore also account for their differential host specificity. A parsimo-
nious interpretation of the origins of this diversity is that an intact
SPI-6 was initially acquired by horizontal transfer after Lomita
branched off, followed by successive, internal deletions prior
to the MRCAs of Paratyphi C and Typhisuis. Alternatively,
multiple SPI-6 variants might each represent an independent
horizontal transfer event.
Evolutionary Timing
These observations immediately raised the question of evolu-
tionary timescales, including the ages of individual serovars.
We confirmed the existence of significant temporal signal
according to root-to-tip distances [37] and date randomization
tests [38] with the non-recombinant SNPs from the Para-C-line-
age genomes from 10 independent samples of Paratyphi C (both
including and excluding Ragna) and also from the Para C lineage
(without Lomita, which lacks a collection date). We then dated

 key stages in the evolution of the Para C lineage by a Bayesian
phylogenetic approach (Figure 3). The optimal model for
Paratyphi C (strict clock) yielded a median substitution rate of
7.9 3 10�8 substitutions/site/year (95% credible interval: 5.3 3
10�8-1.1 3 10�7), slightly lower than the median rate estimated
according to the optimal model (relaxed) for the Para C lineage
(1.5 3 10�7; 95% CI: 6.9 3 10�8 – 2.5 3 10�7) (Table S4). The
age of the crown group encompassing modern isolates of Para-
typhi C was dated at 456–664 BP (95% CI: 251–922) and its split
from Ragna at 1,162–1,526 (95% CI: 883-1,975) (Table S4).
Thus, the addition of the Ragna genome sheds light on about
800 additional years of evolutionary history of Paratyphi C.
Our estimate of the timescale allowed us to investigate the
rates of gain or loss events and pseudogene formation within
Paratyphi C relative to the accumulation of SNPs (Figure S3).
The results showed that pseudogenes accumulated slowly and
continuously (3–5 per 100 SNPs) since the tMRCA until the last
200 years, when their rate accelerated to 7 pseudogenes/100
SNPs (Figure S3A). The rate of gene gain or loss was also low
(1.3 genes/100 SNPs) until 400 years ago, increased to 15–20
genes/100 SNPs and increased even further to 49 genes/100
SNPs in the last 50 years before laboratory cultivation (Fig-
ure S3B). Similar results were obtained for the other sub-lineages
within the Para C lineage (Figures S3C and S3D). Recent gene
gain or loss has also been noted in S. enterica serovars Paratyphi
A [25] and Agona [26] and was attributed to frequent acquisitions
of selfish DNA, which were also subsequently rapidly lost. Our
results confirm that genomic islands are indeed highly variable
in modern isolates. However, they clearly show that they were
lost or gained much less often in previous millennia, which
were marked by relative pan-genomic stability.
The age of the stem lineage of Paratyphi C stretches back to its
differentiation
from
serovar
Typhisuis,
about
2,663 years
(95% CI: 1,440–4,683), during which time �1,350 SNPs were
accumulated prior to the MRCAs of the PC-1 and PC-2 clades
(Figure 3). In turn, the estimated tMRCA for Paratyphi C, Typhi-
suis plus Choleraesuis was approximately 3,428 years ago
(95% CI: 1,707–6,172) and that ancestor evolved in Europe
according to three independent Bayesian and maximum-likeli-
hood methods. A European ancestry is consistent with the
existence of Paratyphi C and enteric fever in northern Norway
800 years ago and also with enteric fever caused by Paratyphi
C bacteria in Mexico in 1,545 CE, which was inferred to have
been introduced by Europeans [19]. We also note that serovars
Choleraesuis and Typhisuis infect swine and that their tMRCAs
overlap with the Neolithic domestication of pigs from wild boar
in Europe [39] (Figure 3). It is therefore possible that Paratyphi
C represents the host specialization to humans of a zoonotic
pathogen of domesticated animals. Alternatively, Typhisuis
may have specialized from a generalist life style to a host spec-
ificity for swine.
Our identification of the Ragna genome from a young woman
who died in 1,200 CE provides insights on the genomic contents
of the stem lineage of serovar Paratyphi C. The Ragna genome
also demonstrates that salmonellosis was a deadly invasive
disease of humans for centuries before its first recognition by
physicians. Our analyses show that reconstructing the long-
term evolutionary
history
of bacterial
pathogens
benefits
dramatically from comparisons of metagenomic data from
ancient samples with population genetic data from present-
day bacteria. The close relationship between clades of the
Para C lineage that differ in host specificity triggered intriguing
speculations about historical host jumps during the Neolithic
period between humans and their domesticated animals. Our
results also indicate that both the core and accessory genome
of bacterial pathogens can be remarkably stable over millennia
and that much of the dramatic variation between extant
genomes represents transient genetic fluctuation, whose evolu-
tionary relevance to ecological fitness is uncertain.

Further information and requests for resources and reagents should be directed to and will be fulfilled by the Lead Contact, Mark
Achtman (m.achtman@warwick.ac.uk).
EXPERIMENTAL MODEL AND SUBJECT DETAILS
Permission to undertake genetic analysis on SK152 was granted to MTP Gilbert by the Norwegian Research Ethics Committee
(ref 2011/73).
SK152
SK152 was excavated in June, 1985, from grave 523E in a cemetery on the north side of a church in Trondheim, Norway (Figure 1A).
The skeleton rested on a wooden plank (symbolic coffin) (Figure 1B). According to the daybook written in the field, the grave was filled
with ‘‘grey, sandy loam, wood chips’’ which likely represents a mixture of minerogenic soil and waste from wood-building activities in
the nearby, densely built-up area. The grave itself was covered with a wooden chip layer derived from later building activity in the
area. The stratigraphical information indicates that the environment surrounding SK152 was anoxic, acidic, and waterlogged.
Preservation
The overall surface preservation of bone elements was very good, grade 1 according to the seven-category grading system defined
by McKinley [76]. The skeleton was over 90% complete, with almost all bone elements present. Only minimal localized areas of bone
damage due to post mortem disturbance were noted, and a small degree of fragmentation. Discoloration due to burial taphonomy
was noted, but this was characteristic of the whole assemblage and did not impact on the visual inspection of bone surface.
Age and sex
Skeleton 152 was assigned to the young adult category (19-24 years) [77] on the basis of dental eruption and dental wear pattern,
degeneration of the pelvis and fusion of epiphyses. Standard techniques for osteological sex determination [78] indicated that SK152
was female, and this conclusion was confirmed by the ratio of sequences aligning to the Y chromosome relative to the total number of
sequences aligning to both sex chromosomes [79]. The mtDNA haplogroup was H4a.
Origins
The oxygen composition in enamel apatite carbonates from the first (M1) and third (M3) molars yielded M1 and M3 d18OCarbon values
of 21.13& and 24.72& on the VSMOW scale, respectively. The d18OCarbon data was converted to d18Owater (oxygen composition in
water/precipitation) by using Equation 6 from citation [80] as modified by citation [81], to yield d18Owater values of �15& to �16.5& for
M1 and �9.3 ± 1& for M3 [14]. The values from the first molar suggest that SK152 was born inland in northern Scandinavia or in the
north-western regions of Russia, whereas the values from the third molar indicate that she arrived in Trondheim in her childhood
years [14].
METHOD DETAILS
Dating of SK152
The burial of SK152 was dated by two alternative methods (Figure S1). Grave 523E was part of sub-phase FN7/level II within an exten-
sion of the cemetery, corresponding to a building phase when the cemetery had recently been extended northward, and covered
older/earlier buildings from sub-phase FN6. The construction of FN6 began ca. 1150 CE. Sub-phase FN7 was initially dated to
‘‘mid 1200s’’ with the aid of ceramics, coins, 14C-dating and archaeological lead artifacts (Reed in citation [82], p. 192), but this
estimate was later revised to 1175-1225 CE on the basis of additional dendrographic dating (Figure 23 in citation [83]). Accelerator
Mass Spectrometry (AMS) dating was performed at DirectAMS and Oxford Radiocarbon Accelerator Unit, yielding dates in radio-
carbon years BP (Before 1950 CE) using the 14C half-life of 5,568 years. Isotopic fractionation was corrected using the d13C values
measured on the AMS. The quoted d13C values were measured independently on a stable isotope mass spectrometer (to ± 0:3 per mil
relative to VPDB). For details of the chemical pre-treatment, target preparation and AMS measurement see [84, 85]. Figure S1B
shows calendar age ranges calculated by the OxCal computer program (v4.2) of C. Bronk Ramsey [48], using the ‘IntCal13’ dataset

 [86]. These calculations support dates of 994-1052 CE with 53% likelihood and 1081-1152 CE with 42% likelihood. We summarized
these results as 1,073 ± 79 years, which is the mean ± range of the lowest and highest extremes.
Metagenomic sequencing of samples from SK152
All molecular work including pre-library amplification was conducted in dedicated aDNA clean laboratory facilities at the Centre for
GeoGenetics, Natural History Museum, University of Copenhagen. All samples were collected and processed using strict aDNA
guidelines. Nine sequencing libraries were prepared from the upper 3rd left molar root including dental pulp, the upper 2nd right molar
dentine/cementum (200 mg) and pulp (interior root canal, 200 mg), femoral long bone (300 mg), and a mixture of mineralized dental
plaque (calculus, 30 mg) taken from multiple teeth. These samples were processed in a specialized drill room within the dedicated
aDNA facilities.
In the initial investigation, the entire root of the upper 3rd left molar was crushed, and DNA extracted according to Rohland and
Hofreiter [87], with a pre-digestion step as described by Allentoft et al. [88]. The same protocol was used for the interior dental
pulp. For the upper 2nd right molar, the entire tooth was removed from the mandible, and the tooth crown separated horizontally
from the tooth root with a diamond-dust-coated cutting disk in a mechanical drill. The tooth root surface was then cleaned with a
new cutting disk before using a small pointed drill bit to remove the interior dental pulp. DNA was extracted from this pulp as above.
The remaining dentine and cementum fractions were crushed with a hammer, and also extracted. (We extracted dentine as well as
cementum because this has previously maximized the yield of endogenous DNA.) The extraction protocol for this material and for
dental calculus fully followed the protocols of Allentoft et al. [88] which are based on silica powder-based extraction, except that silica
powder was only incubated for 1 h in the supernatant rather than the full 3 h.
DNA libraries for sequencing were prepared through blunt end ligation using NEBNext DNA sample preparation reagents (E6070)
and Illumina specific adapters following established protocols. The libraries were shotgun sequenced (Table 1) in pools across 15
different lanes using Illumina HiSeq 2500 and 4000 platforms, and with a mix of 80 and 100-bp single read and 150-bp paired
end chemistry. All pools submitted for sequencing contained between 5-15nM of DNA.
After initial screening, the highest proportion of Salmonella-specific reads were found in the upper 2nd right molar dentine/
cementum (Table 1). Additional libraries were constructed from the same extracts with the same protocol, and also shotgun
sequenced to increase the depth of coverage.
Genomic assemblies from metagenomic sequences of samples from SK152
Genomic assemblies from metagenomic reads
Taxonomic profiling of metagenomic reads with currently available traditional methods can yield false indications of the presence of
bacterial pathogens because pathogens are over-represented in public databases relative to environmental organisms, and
completed genomes of many environmental bacteria are not yet available. As a result, ecological metagenomic analyses have
used de novo assemblies of raw reads [89] but this has not yet been applied in aDNA studies. We therefore investigated whether
de novo assemblies could reveal the presence of bacterial pathogens within the nine metagenomic libraries from SK152, and
used subsequent analysis of deamination rates to determine whether those assemblies were ancient or modern.
Assembly and binning
We excluded reads within the metagenomic libraries that mapped to the human genome according to BWA [49]. The non-human
reads were co-assembled into contiguous sequences (contigs) with MEGAHIT [50], using default parameters. Contigs which
exceeded 20 kb were split into 10 kb fragments. All 39,016 contigs greater than 1 kb in length were clustered by CONCOCT [12] into
76 bins using both sequence composition and coverage across all samples. All of the contigs in each bin were potentially derived
from a single bin-specific genomic assembly. Protein encoding sequences on these contigs were called using PRODIGAL [52], and
then categorised in terms of function according to Clusters of Orthologous Groups of proteins (COGs) [90]. We previously identified
36 single copy core COGs (SCGs) that are found in a single copy in all bacterial genomes [12]. We therefore tested each of the bins for
the number of copies of these 36 SCGs, and found that 11 bins largely represented MAGs (unique metagenome assembled
genomes) because they contained at least 27 SCGs (75% of 36) in a single copy.
Taxonomic assignments
We constructed a phylogenetic tree of the 36 SCGs from 1,755 reference genomes plus the 11 MAGs. The reference genomes
consisted of one representative from each bacterial genus and each archaeal species with complete genome sequences in NCBI.
Each SCG was aligned separately using MAFFT [53], and overhangs were trimmed with TRIMAL [54]. Where exceptional MAGs
contained multiple SCGs, we chose one of the sequence variants at random. The concatenated SCG alignments were used to
construct a single tree with FASTTREE [55]. For taxonomic assignments, we identified the ancestral node containing each MAG plus
one or more reference genomes, and the most frequent taxonomic designation among the neighboring reference genomes was as-
signed to that MAG (Concoct 3, see Key Resources Table). C72 was initially assigned to Mogibacterium timidum, but only few related
reference genomes existed in NCBI. We therefore compared C72 against the rMLST database [91] which contains > 200K genomes
representing over 6,000 bacterial species. To this end, the translated amino acids of representative alleles in the rMLST database
were mapped onto C72 using TBLASTN. This identified the positions of 46 of the 53 ribosomal genes. Those 46 ribosomal genes
were then compared against all genomes in the rMLST database using TBLASTN. Analyses of both concatenated sequences and
gene-by-gene analyses showed that C72 was more similar to Eubacterium sulci (74% identity) than Mogibacterium timidum
(70%). We therefore re-assigned C72 to Eubacterium.

 Calculation of deamination rates
BWA was used to map the metagenomic reads onto all contigs within each MAG, as well as to the human genome hg38 and Paratyphi
C RKS4594. We then used MAPDAMAGE 2.0 [56] to separately characterize the DNA damage associated with each of the 13 organisms.
The posterior mean estimates and standard deviations for dS, the single-stranded deamination rate for all genomes and MAGs
(Concoct 3, see Key Resources Table) are depicted graphically in Figure 1D.
Interpretation of sources of MAGs
According to Kistler et al. [15], nine of the MAGs likely reflect recent soil contamination because their 50-single-stranded deamination
rates were low (DNA damage < 0.22) versus values of 0.47 for the human DNA and 0.9 for Ragna (Concoct 4, see Key Resources
Table). C69 was unambiguously classified as Methanosphaerula palustris, a archaeal methanogen which is associated with acidic
peat bogs [92], and belongs to a group of hydrogenotrophic methanogens with no human-associated relatives. Similarly, C40 and
C66 were assigned to the environmental sulfate-reducing species Desulfatiglans anilini and Desulfomonile tiedjei, respectively,
but not to human-associated sulfate reducers, such as Desulfovibrio species [93].
Two other assembled genomes exhibited high levels of DNA damage. C72, a novel species of Eubacterium, may have been a major
component of a biofilm associated with periodontal disease [16]. In support of this role, C72 was recovered almost exclusively from
dental calculus whereas reads from the putative environmental taxa were present in multiple sources (Concoct 5, see Key Resources
Table). C18 belongs to Acidovorax, which is associated with plant pathogens [17], and may have been introduced with the wood
chips that covered the skeleton.
Genotyping by EnteroBase
For selected genera, EnteroBase (see Key Resources Table) automatically assembles genomes from all publicly available Illumina
short reads as well as from short reads that are uploaded by users [18]. De novo assemblies of Illumina reads are superior to reference
based mapping because they recover accessory genomic regions which are not necessarily present in the reference genome. How-
ever, all current assemblers yield a certain proportion of false base calls which do not necessarily represent the consensus of all
reads. EnteroBase therefore implements a post-assembly pipeline to call SNPs based on the consensus. In brief, the ends of
sequenced reads with base quality less than 5 are removed (trimmed) using SICKLE [74, 94] and assembled into contigs using SPADES
3.5 [57] with the parameter ‘–only-assembler’ and k-mers equal to 0.3, 0.5, 0.7 and 0.9 of the average read lengths. To validate the
consensus call for each base in the assemblies, the original trimmed, sequenced reads are mapped back to the corresponding
assembled contigs using BWA [49], and analyzed with SAMTOOLS/BCFTOOLS 1.2 0.7.12-r1039 [95]. The quality scores for consensus
calling for each base are stored together with the assemblies in standard FASTQ format. Finally, assembled contigs are assigned
taxonomic labels using KRAKEN [42] in order to exclude potential contamination from other genera.
Assemblies that pass internal quality criteria, including a mean coverage of R 20-fold are automatically genotyped by multiple
multi-locus sequence typing (MLST) schemes into Sequence Types (STs) consisting of unique allele numbers for each genetic locus.
Details of these schemes are available on the Help pages at EnteroBase. For Salmonella, these MLST schemes currently include a 7
housekeeping gene legacy scheme [3] and rMLST based on 51 ribosomal proteins as defined by Jolley et al. [91], and whose
reference allelic sequences are maintained at the primary rMLST database at Oxford University [91]. EnteroBase also calculates
alleles for wgMLST based on a pan-genome of 21,065 genes. In brief, the wgMLST scheme encompasses unique sets of homologs
with R 70% pairwise amino acid similarity over 50% of their length, and which were defined on the basis of 537 diverse, high quality
Salmonella genomes. These homolog sets are usually either absent from individual Salmonella genomes, or are present only in a
single copy. cgMLST (core genome MLST) V2 consists of that subset of 3,002 loci from the wgMLST scheme which met the following
conditions for the 3,144 rMLST STs in S. enterica that had been defined by May, 2016: presence in R 98% of genomes; an intact
reading frame in R 94%; and of unexceptional genetic diversity. For several homolog sets, more than one copy is occasionally
present per genome. When rare genomes contain two or more copies of any wgMLST or cgMLST locus, that locus is scored internally
as duplicated for that genome, and is hidden to public access for that genome.
Species trees of S. enterica subspecies I
Most aDNA analyses have been performed with genetically monomorphic pathogens with only limited genetic diversity, and where
recombination is rare. However, typical species containing bacterial pathogens, such as S. enterica, are usually much more genet-
ically diverse, and commonly also undergo recombination. Until now a reliable and publicly available phylogenetic topology of
S. enterica genomes did not exist, and it was not readily possible to accurately assign individual metagenomic reads to individual
lineages [96]. We therefore assembled a collection of genomes that represent the entire genetic diversity of 50,000 genomes of
S. enterica subsp. I by choosing one random representative of each of the 2,964 rMLST STs from that subspecies that were present
in EnteroBase (May, 2016) (Salmonella supertree 1, see Key Resources Table). These genomes can be accessed at the Enterobase
Workspace rST Representatives (see Key Resources Table). We performed super-tree analyses on the sequences of the 3,002 core
genes in cgMLST v2 from these 2,964 representatives. The sequences of each core gene were aligned using MAFFT [53]. These align-
ments were used to calculate species trees by two different algorithms. i) A Maximum Likelihood tree of the concatenated, aligned
sequences of all core gene sequences (2.8 Mb) (Salmonella supertree 3, see Key Resources Table) was generated using a GTRCAT
model in RAxML v8.2.4 [43] (Figure 2A). ii) Maximum Likelihood trees were also generated by RAXML for each of the 3,002 core gene
alignments, and these 3,002 gene trees were processed by ASTRID [44]. ASTRID is a recently developed coalescent-based method for
species tree estimation that is statistically consistent under the multi-species coalescent, can account for incomplete lineage sorting,
is one of the most accurate currently available methods, and can handle large amounts of data. Because ASTRID only infers topology,
e6
Current Biology 28, 2420–2428.e1–e10, August 6, 2018
 we derived the branch lengths from sequence distances within the concatenated alignment using RAXML with a GTRGAMMA model
(Salmonella supertree 2, see Key Resources Table). The topologies of the two trees were identical near the root and toward the tips,
and at 75% of the intermediate branches. These trees were used for phylogenetic placement (MGPLACER) [58] of the metagenomic
reads from SK152. We also compared the results from ASTRID with those from a separate species tree (data not shown) calculated with
the help of a GPU compilation of ASTRAL-II [97] by S. Mirarab and T. Warnow. The species trees generated by ASTRAL and ASTRID were
almost indistinguishable (data not shown). In all three species trees, two genomes from the rare serovar Birkenhead clustered
unambiguously with the Para C lineage, and were used as an outgroup for rooting trees in further analyses (Figure 2).
Sources of genomes from the Para C Lineage
The species trees identified 100 genomes in Enterobase that were in the Para C lineage, or closely related to it. Most of these
genomes were very recent, epidemiological isolates from the UK (PHE) and USA (FDA), but a number of them were from strains
sequenced by the Wellcome Trust Sanger Centre that had been tested by legacy MLST [3] or were from the historical Murray collec-
tion [98]. In order to ensure that we spanned diverse sources and dates, we cultivated 119 additional old isolates from the historical,
global collection at the Institut Pasteur, Paris, and also sequenced their genomes.
Total DNA was extracted with a Maxwell 16 cell DNA purification kit (Promega, Madison WI), in accordance with the manufacturer’s
recommendations. Libraries were constructed using the Nextera XT kit (Illumina) with the following modifications. The initial tagmen-
tation reaction was performed using 2 ml of 0.7 ng/ml of template DNA and 2/5 of the specified volume for other reagents, resulting in a
volume of 10 ml after neutralization. For the PCR step, 25 ml of 2x Extensor Hi-Fidelity PCR master mix (Thermo Scientific), 5 ml of each
index primer (4 mM) and 5 ml of sterile distilled water was added to the tagmentation reaction. The standard PCR reaction was
extended by an extra 3 cycles, and the extension step was lowered from 72�C to 68�C. The libraries were purified using 25 ml of
Ampure XP beads (Beckman Coulter) with two 200 ml washes with 80% ethanol before elution in 30 ml of RSB from the Nextera
XT kit. Libraries were quantified using the Qubit dsDNA HS Assay Kit (Thermo Scientific), and diluted to 3.2 ng/ml (approx. 8 nM).
Pooled libraries (40 samples per run) were denatured following the Illumina protocol, and 600 ml (approx. 20 pM) was loaded onto
a MiSeq V2 �500 cycle cartridge (Illumina), and sequenced on a MiSeq to produce FASTQ files of short reads.
The short reads were uploaded to EnteroBase and to the Short Read Archives. Their metadata and genome properties are sum-
marized together with other genomes of the Para C lineage in Table S5 and can be examined interactively in the EnteroBase public
workspace Para C lineage (see Key Resources Table).
Salmonella short reads from metagenomic aDNA
Initial analyses
Metagenomic reads from 33 human skeletons from Trondheim, Norway were screened using KRAKEN [42] with its default genomic
database (Workflow, see Key Resources Table). KRAKEN scored 304 metagenomic reads from skeleton SK152 as being Salmonella,
and did not score any reads from the 32 other skeletons as Salmonella or other potentially invasive bacterial pathogens. However, the
taxon assignments provided by KRAKEN can be problematical when reads are present at low concentrations [99]. In our hands, the
KRAKEN analyses of SK152 also failed to identify seven of the eleven taxa that yielded assembled MAGs with CONCOCT (Concoct 6;
Concoct 7, see Key Resources Table). We therefore tested the reads from SK152 that had been identified as Salmonella by ad
hoc BLASTN alignments to a custom database based on 91,000 bacterial, archaeal, and viral genomes from the non-redundant
nucleotide database in GenBank, and confirmed that 266 (87%) scored as S. enterica. MGPlacer [58] was then used to iteratively
map those Salmonella-specific metagenomic reads onto a core SNP phylogeny based on one genome from each of the 20
Salmonella serovars represented in RefSeq (May, 2016). All Salmonella-specific reads mapped on the branch leading to serovar
Paratyphi C strain RKS4594.
Ragna-specific reads in metagenomic libraries
Reads were pre-processed using BBMERGE and BBDUK2 from the BBMAP package [60]. Sequences specific to the Ragna genome were
then identified by alignment against two sets of reference genomes using BOWTIE2 [61]: i) The ‘‘ParaC’’ set, consisting of all 219 mod-
ern genomes in the Para C lineage and ii) the ‘‘outgroup’’ set, consisting of representatives of all (4,441) non-Salmonella bacterial
genomes in RefSeq, plus the human genome hg38. We assigned sequencing reads to Ragna if they yielded equal or better alignment
scores to the ParaC set than to the outgroup, and differed in sequence from the most similar genome in the ParaC lineage by no more
than 4%. Potentially duplicated reads were removed by retaining only one Ragna-specific read sequence when multiple identical
reads were identified. The quality of the Ragna-specific reads are summarized in Figure S2.
SNPs in the Ragna genome
The Ragna-specific, unique reads were aligned against Paratyphi C reference genome RKS4594 using BOWTIE2 [61] with the end-to-
end option and analyzed using SAMTOOLS/BCFTOOLS 1.2 [62]. In order to exclude potential spurious SNPs due to deamination
(Figure S2C), the consensus base was only called on sites that were covered by at least two reads with a consensus base
quality R 10 and which were located at least 5 bases from either read end (Figure S2B). Exceptionally, SNP calls with single coverage
matching these criteria were included if the same call was provided by previously excluded 50 and 30 ends of reads.
Reference based SNP calling in modern genomes
Assemblies within the Para C lineage plus Birkenhead (Figure S4) were aligned against RKS4594 using LAST [63], and SNPs from
these alignments were filtered to remove regions with low base qualities (Q < 10) or ambiguous alignment (ambiguity R 0.1).
Sites were also removed if they aligned with R 95% identity to disperse repetitive regions that were longer than 100 bp (BLASTN),
Current Biology 28, 2420–2428.e1–e10, August 6, 2018
e7
 overlapped with tandem repeats (TRF) [64], or overlapped with CRISPR regions (PILER-CR) [65]. Of the remaining SNPs, 61,451 were
called in R 95% of the genomes from the ParaC Lineage plus Birkenhead, and were retained as core genomic SNPs (ParaC genome
SNPs 2, see Key Resources Table).
Reconstruction of the mutational phylogeny of the Para C lineage
An initial phylogeny (ParaC genome SNPs 3, see Key Resources Table) was calculated on all 61,451 core SNPs from the Para C
lineage plus Birkenhead using RAxML v8.2.4 [43] under a GTRCAT model with Stamatakis ascertainment correction for invariant sites
[100]. SNPs were assigned using RecHMM [25] onto branches in that phylogeny using a maximum likelihood method with a symmet-
ric transition model [101]. The results indicated that 21,071 genomic sites had suffered substitution events along the branches leading
to serovars Paratyphi C, Typhisuis and Choleraesuis, of which 406 sites (1.9%) were mutated on multiple independent occasions
(homoplasies) resulting in a total of 21,849 substitution events (ParaC genome SNPs 1; ParaC genome SNPs 2, see Key Resources
Table). RecHMM also identified 1,602 SNPs that were clustered, which are the hallmarks of homologous recombination. After
excluding the recombinational SNPs, the remaining 20,247 core mutational SNPs were used for further phylogenetic analyses.
The RAxML phylogeny based on these mutational SNPs (Figure 2B) differed only in branch lengths but not in topology from the initial
RAxML phylogeny based on all core SNPs. The mutational phylogeny was also used for additional analyses of gene gain and loss and
numbers of pseudogenes (Figure 3; Para C Pan-genome 1, see Key Resources Table) and ancestral reconstruction (Ancestral recon-
struction 1, see Key Resources Table).
In separate experiments, recombinant SNPs on the branches to serovars Paratyphi C, Typhisuis and Choleraesuis were called by
the alternative programs ClonalFrameML [102] and Gubbins [103] and compared with the calls by RecHMM. 20,023 SNPs were
scored as mutational and 1,407 SNPs as recombinational by all three programs, but the programs differed in their assignments
for 398 SNPs (1.8%) (ParaC genome SNPs 4, see Key Resources Table). In contrast, the three programs differed dramatically in their
assignments of SNPs on the branches to Lomita and Birkenhead, and we did not attempt to subdivide those SNPs into recombina-
tional versus mutational.
Date estimates for Paratyphi C and related serovars
Date estimates based on Bayesian phylogenetic analysis are summarized in Table S4.
Bayesian phylogenetic approach
Core mutational SNPs were analyzed using BEAST v1.8.3 [45] with the GTR+G model of nucleotide substitution, with a discrete
gamma distribution and six rate categories to account for rate heterogeneity across sites. To account for SNP ascertainment
bias, we applied a correction that incorporated the nucleotide frequencies across all of the constant sites. For computational trac-
tability, we analyzed two subsamples each from the Para C lineage without Lomita; serovar Paratyphi C serovar (including Ragna);
and modern crown serovar Paratyphi C strains (excluding Ragna). Each subsample comprised 50 random genomes, except that the
Ragna sequence and the sole genome in the CS-3 cluster were deliberately included when present in the test set. Sub-samples
including the Ragna genomes were run with either of two dates for Ragna (1200 CE from archaeological dates and 1073 CE from
AMS calibrated ages). Thus, our Bayesian phylogenetic analyses involved 12 datasets (Date estimation 3, see Key Resources Table).
The raw trees are presented in Date estimation 4 (see Key Resources Table).
Posterior distributions of parameters, including the MCC tree, were estimated using Markov chain Monte Carlo sampling. Samples
were drawn every 5,000 steps over a total of 5 3 107 steps, with the first 10% of samples discarded as burn-in. Marginal likelihoods
were used to compare two clock models (strict clock and uncorrelated lognormal relaxed clock) and three demographic models for
the tree prior (constant population size, Bayesian Skyride coalescent [104], and birth-death process with serial sampling [105]).
Marginal likelihoods were estimated using stepping-stone sampling [106], with 20 path steps and a chain length of 106 per path
step, and the most likely model combinations are indicated in bold print in Date estimation 3 (see Key Resources Table). This table
also presents the median MRCA estimates plus 95% credible intervals based on all six model combinations for the Para C lineage,
Paratyphi C including Ragna and the Paratyphi C modern crown lineage (without Ragna). The optimal model for Paratyphi C including
Ragna was the strict clock model with constant population size. The optimal model for the ParaC Lineage was UCLD (uncorrelated
relaxed clock) model with constant population size. To ensure that these results did not represent outliers due to limited numbers of
runs, we also tested eight additional subsamples using these optimal models and assuming a date for Ragna of 1200 CE. The median
values for their estimates of tMRCAs and mutational clock rates and the corresponding 95% confidence intervals are summarized in
Table S4.
Temporal structure
It is crucial to verify the existence of temporal structure in datasets used for date estimation. We therefore tested the reliability of the
BEAST analyses by date randomization tests [38] which analyze multiple, date-randomized replicate datasets after randomly reassign-
ing the ages of the sequences. Datasets are considered to have strong temporal structure when the 95% credible interval of the rate
estimate from the original data does not overlap with those of the rate estimates from the date-randomized replicates [107]. We used
10 date randomizations for each of the initial two sub-samples, with and without Ragna, and found strong temporal signals within all
sub-samples of modern genomes analyzed with BEAST (Date estimation 1, see Key Resources Table).
Root-to-tip regression
We also used an alternative method to estimate temporal signal for dating on the non-recombinational SNPs in 116 Paratyphi C
genomes and the 205 Para C lineage genomes with known collection dates, including Ragna but excluding Lomita. This consisted
of a regression of root-to-tip distances with TEMPEST [37] (previously designated PATH-O-GEN) in which the degree of within-lineage
e8
Current Biology 28, 2420–2428.e1–e10, August 6, 2018
 rate heterogeneity is evaluated by calculating the correlation coefficient. A regression based on one aDNA genome (Ragna) plus
multiple modern genomes is basically a regression line based on two points. We therefore also included two additional aDNA
genomes, Tepos-14 and Tepos-35 from 1,545 CE in Mexico [19]. The results (Data estimation 2, see Key Resources Table) showed
a clear temporal signal in both datasets, with an extrapolation to the root which was similar to the tMRCAs found with BEAST. The
Paratyphi C dataset yielded R2 of 0.38, which confirms the existence of temporal signal. The Para C lineage only had an R2 of
0,04 indicating that TEMPEST is not suited for the analyses of these data.
Inferring ancestral geographic sources
A subtree of genomes with geographic source information was extracted from the Para C lineage phylogeny plus the outgroup
Birkenhead with the ETE3 Python package [66]. (Lomita is lacking from this subtree because its geographic source is uncertain).
The ancestral geographic states of internal nodes in the subtree were inferred by three independent algorithms: i) the Maximum Likeli-
hood comparison [108] in BayesTraits [47]; ii) the Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) approach [109] in BayesTraits; and iii) Bayesian
Binary MCMC in RASP [75]. All three algorithms indicated a European origin for individual nodes within the Para C lineage (Ancestral
reconstruction 1; Ancestral reconstruction 2, see Key Resources Table), and this conclusion was not affected by the inclusion or
absence of Ragna. A European origin of the entire Para C lineage was also strongly supported by BayesTraits MCMC and RASP,
and moderately supported by BayesTraits ML (Ancestral reconstruction 2, see Key Resources Table).
Reconstruction of the pan genome of the Para C lineage
A wide collection of annotated reference genes was collected from three sources: 1) all 21,065 unique sets of homologs in the
wgMLST scheme in Enterobase; 2) published annotations for the complete genomes of Choleraesuis strains C500 [110], SC-B67
[111] and Paratyphi C strain RKS4594 [112]; 3) PROKKA [67] annotations of all draft genomes in EnteroBase. All these reference genes
were grouped into 29,436 gene clusters using UCLUST [68]. In order to obtain sets of homologous regions that cover R 50% of the
length of the centroid sequences with R 70% nucleotide identity, the centroid sequence from each cluster was aligned with all the
modern genomes in the Para C lineage using BLASTN. Overlapping paralogs between the homolog sets were identified through
the same iterative methodology used to construct the entire Salmonella wgMLST scheme. After removal of paralogs, the remaining
6,665 homolog sets were treated as the pan genes of the Para C lineage (ParaC Pan-genome 4; ParaC Pan-genome 5, see Key
Resources Table).
Reconstruction of pan genome synteny
Synteny was reconstructed as described in Supplemental Materials of Zhou et al. [26], namely through constructing and traversing a
graph of assembled sequences from genes in the Para C lineage pan-genome. First, the graph was seeded with one node for each
unique, single copy gene. The connections between nodes were weighted using the following criteria: 1) Edges connecting pairs of
genes that were co-located on a single contig received maximal weighting. 2) Edges received intermediate weighting that connected
two genes at the ends of distinct contigs that were however linked by read-pairs that straddled both contigs. This intermediate
weighting was 2*(number of read-pairs joining the two contigs)/(total number of unpaired reads at the ends of contigs). 3) Pairs of
genes which did not co-locate according to either of these two criteria were not assigned to a common edge.
CONCORDE [51] was used to find the shortest possible path that visited all the nodes in the graph, which equates to the most likely
gene order within the Para C lineage. Ambiguous paths were inspected manually to identify duplicated genes and collapsed repeats,
because these are usually associated with prophages or plasmids. Such connections were then broken manually and re-joined as
appropriate. Finally, in order to reconstruct the synteny of the pan genome of the Para C lineage, all repetitive genes were inserted into
the gene order according to their location within the assemblies (Figure 2B and ParaC Pan-genome 4, see Key Resources Table).
A total of 227 genomic islands (ParaC Pan-genome 1; ParaC Pan-genome 7, see Key Resources Table) were identified as continuous
blocks of gene gain/loss in the pan genome of the Para C lineage.
The conservation of genes within the pan genome across the Para C lineage was illustrated using Anvi’o [73] (Figure 2B), and can
be examined in detail in a publicly accessible, interactive EnteroBase version of Anvi’o (Pan-genome, see Key Resources Table). The
synteny of pan genes was enforced within the Anvi’o rendering by help of an artificial guide tree based on the gene order in ParaC
Pan-genome 4 (see Key Resources Table), where each sequential gene bifurcates from the previous gene at a constant distance.
(That artificial tree was deleted from the printed version in Figure 2B). The figures are dependent on manually generated input files
based on the annotations and sub-divisions that are indicated in ParaC Pan-genome 4 (see Key Resources Table). The input files also
include the frequencies of pan genes in all sub-lineages, the locations of major genomic islands, as well as additional metadata.
These input files can also be downloaded from the interactive EnteroBase version.
Gain and loss of pseudogenes and intact genes
The gene alignments used to reconstruct the pan genome of the Para C lineage were screened for potential gene disruptions. Genes
with stop codons or frameshifts anywhere in the coding regions were scored as pseudogenes. Pseudogenes and genes that had
been gained or lost were assigned to ancestral states in the core SNP phylogeny (ParaC Pan-genome 1, see Key Resources Table)
by the Maximum Likelihood algorithm [101] as implemented in the R function ACE (Ancestral Character Estimation) within the APE
(Analyses of Phylogenetics and Evolution) package (ParaC Pan-genome 6; ParaC Pan-genome 7, see Key Resources Table) [69].
These ancestral states were used to infer the phylogenetic branches on the SNP tree of the Para C lineage on which 3,125 genes
or parts of genes and 1,251 pseudogenes were independently gained or lost (Figure S3; ParaC Pan-genome 1; ParaC Pan-genome
3, see Key Resources Table). The relative frequencies of gain/loss of intact genes and pseudogenes versus time were estimated as
Current Biology 28, 2420–2428.e1–e10, August 6, 2018
e9
 described [25]: time (years) was calculated from the core SNP phylogeny by dividing branch lengths by the median SNP substitution
rate estimated by BEAST (7.9 3 10�8 substitutions per site per year; Table S4). The 95% confidence intervals for these frequencies of
pseudogenes and gene gain/loss were inferred from 1,000 separate bootstrap re-samplings of pseudogenes or genomic islands. The

Identification of bacteriophages
Prophages in modern genomes of the Para C lineage were identified using the online API in PHASTER [70]. The identified prophages
were taxonomically labeled according to the similarities of their major capsid protein (MCP) to the clusters of bacteriophages
described by Casjens et al. [113]. Further manual taxonomic refinements were based on comparisons of all genes in each prophage
against those in the published phage clusters. Prophage names are the same as the previously described phages which they most
closely resembled, except for GI28, which has no known close relatives, and SPC-P1, which had been previously designated under
that name in the annotation of Paratyphi C RKS4594 [28].
Annotation of genomic islands
BLASTN was used to identify known genomic islands within the pan genome as tight clusters of genes in which R 60% of the
sequences aligned with a previously described SPI/SGI sequence with R 80% nucleotide identity. The genomic sequences used
as references for SPI-1 through SPI-12 were downloaded from PAIDB [40], as were SGI-1 and SGI-2. SPI-13 through SPI-21
were obtained from citations [114–118].
Genes in the pan genome were also screened for an association with mobile elements that are listed in ISFINDER (IS elements) [41],
PLASMIDFINDER 1.3 (incompatibility groups of plasmids) [71] and CONJSCAN-T4SSSCAN (relaxases and key components of type IV secre-
tion systems) [72]. Strong matches were annotated according to those resources (Figure 2B; ParaC Pan-genome 4; ParaC
Pan-genome 7, see Key Resources Table). These analyses identified 227 genetic islands belonging to 127 distinct categories in
which one or more genes were gained or lost (ParaC Pan-genome 3, see Key Resources Table).
QUANTIFICATION AND STATISTICAL ANALYSIS
No statistical methods were used to predetermine sample size. The experiments were not randomized except for Bayesian analyses
and the investigators were not blinded to allocation during experiments and outcome assessment.
