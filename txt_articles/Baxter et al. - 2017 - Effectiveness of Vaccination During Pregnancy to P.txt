abstract
BACKGROUND: Vaccination against pertussis during pregnancy is recommended to protect 
newborns, yet there is limited information about the effectiveness of maternal tetanus 
toxoid, reduced diphtheria toxoid, acellular pertussis (Tdap) vaccine before the first infant 
dose of diphtheria, tetanus and acellular pertussis (DTaP) vaccine and during the first year 
of life in infants who have received DTaP.
METHODS: In a retrospective cohort study of infants born at Kaiser Permanente Northern 
California from 2010 to 2015, we estimated the effectiveness of maternal pertussis 
vaccination for protecting newborns against pertussis in the first 2 months of life and in the 
first year of life accounting for each infant DTaP dose.
RESULTS: Among 148 981 newborns, the vaccine effectiveness of maternal Tdap was 91.4% 
(95% confidence interval [CI], 19.5 to 99.1) during the first 2 months of life and 69.0% (95% 
CI, 43.6 to 82.9) during the entire first year of life. The vaccine effectiveness was 87.9% 
(95% CI, 41.4 to 97.5) before infants had any DTaP vaccine doses, 81.4% (95% CI, 42.5 to 
94.0) between doses 1 and 2, 6.4% (95% CI, −165.1 to 66.9) between doses 2 and 3, and 
65.9% (95% CI, 4.5 to 87.8) after infants had 3 DTaP doses.
CONCLUSIONS: Maternal Tdap vaccination was highly protective against infant pertussis, 
especially in the first 2 months of life. Even after infant DTaP dosing, there was evidence of 
additional protection from maternal Tdap vaccination for the first year of life. This study 
strongly supports the United States’ current recommendation to administer Tdap during 
each pregnancy.

WhAT’S KNOWN ON ThIS SUbjECT: Tetanus toxoid, 
reduced diphtheria toxoid, acellular pertussis (Tdap) 
vaccination during pregnancy is recommended to 
protect newborns against pertussis, yet there is 
limited evidence about its effectiveness before and 
after infants are immunized with diphtheria, tetanus 
and acellular pertussis (DTaP) vaccine.
WhAT ThIS STUDy ADDS: Maternal Tdap vaccination 
during pregnancy is highly effective during the 
first 2 months of life. There was no evidence of 
interference between maternal Tdap and infant DTaP 
vaccines; instead, maternal Tdap vaccination adds to 
the protection infants receive from DTaP.

Pertussis, or whooping cough, a 
respiratory infection caused by 
the bacteria Bordetella pertussis, 
can affect persons of any age, 
but it is particularly virulent and 
life-threatening in infants. Rates 
of pertussis infection have been 
increasing in recent years, in part 
due to rapidly waning immunity of 
diphtheria, tetanus and acellular 
pertussis (DTaP) vaccines and 
their diminished effectiveness in 
comparison with older whole-cell 
pertussis vaccines.1 
– 
3
In the United States, primary 
immunization of infants with DTaP 
vaccines is recommended at 2, 4, 
and 6 months of age. In the early 
months of life before newborns can 
benefit from the DTaP vaccine, they 
receive some protection against 
pertussis from maternal antibodies 
transferred during pregnancy. 
Without pertussis vaccination during 
pregnancy, maternal pertussis 
antibodies in the infant decline 
substantially by 6 weeks of age 
and become undetectable by about 
4 months of age.4 Infants born to 
women vaccinated with tetanus 
toxoid, reduced diphtheria toxoid, 
acellular pertussis (Tdap) during 
pregnancy have been found to have 
high levels of pertussis antibodies 
before receiving their first DTaP 
vaccine dose.5
The strategy of immunizing pregnant 
women to boost maternal antibody 
transfer appears to be more effective 
for protecting young infants against 
pertussis than are attempts at 
“cocooning, 
” in which mothers and 
other persons in close contact with 
newborns are vaccinated.6 
– 
9 To 
enhance protection in vulnerable 
infants too young to be vaccinated 
themselves, several countries now 
recommend routinely immunizing 
pregnant women with Tdap to increase 
the transfer of pertussis antibodies 
from mothers to infants.5, 
 
10, 
 
11 With 
this in mind, in October 2011, the 
Centers for Disease Control and 
Prevention’s Advisory Committee 
on Immunization Practices (ACIP) 
recommended Tdap vaccination 
in pregnant women who had not 
previously received the Tdap 
vaccine.12 In February 2013, the 
ACIP extended this recommendation 
to administer the Tdap vaccine 
during every pregnancy, regardless 
of previous Tdap vaccination, at 
any time during pregnancy, but 
preferably between 27 and 36 
weeks’ gestation to maximize 
antibody transfer.13, 
14 These 
ACIP recommendations largely 
supplanted an earlier one, in place 
since 2006, to administer the Tdap 
vaccine to mothers in the immediate 
postpartum period.
There have been concerns that 
maternal Tdap vaccination during 
pregnancy may hinder the infant 
immune response to the 3-dose 
primary DTaP series. Blunting of 
the response to pertussis vaccines 
in infants after maternal Tdap 
immunization has been observed, 
5, 
 
15 
but interference with infant pertussis 
protection may be less of a problem 
for acellular vaccines than for earlier 
whole-cell vaccines.16
Substantial evidence supports 
the safety of Tdap vaccination in 
pregnancy.17 
– 
20 However, there  
is limited evidence on its 
effectiveness, 
21, 
 
22 and only 1 
study has estimated Tdap vaccine 
effectiveness (VE) in infants who 
have also received the DTaP 
vaccine.23 In this study, we assessed 
the effectiveness of maternal Tdap 
vaccination for preventing pertussis 
in infants during the first 2 months 
of life and during the first year of life. 
We also analyzed the effectiveness 
of maternal Tdap vaccination during 
pregnancy after each of the first 
3 infant doses of DTaP to address 
concerns about interference.
Our analyses focused on the 
VE of administering Tdap 
during pregnancy, as currently 
recommended, using data from the 
2010 and 2014 California epidemics. 
In 2010, California experienced its 
highest incidence of pertussis in over 
50 years, followed by an even larger 
outbreak in 2014.24 In addition, we 
examined the VE of Tdap given to 
mothers postpartum, the cocooning 
strategy previously recommended.
METhODS
Setting
Kaiser Permanente of Northern 
California (KPNC) is a large 
integrated medical care organization 
that provides comprehensive 
medical services to ∼3.7 million 
members. Members receive almost 
all medical care at KPNC-owned 
facilities, including clinics, hospitals, 
pharmacies, and laboratories. 
Databases capture detailed 
information on all medical services, 
including deliveries, vaccinations, 
laboratory tests, and on enrollment 
and demographics. Delivery records 
include medical record numbers for 
both babies and their mothers, so 
we can link their information. Since 
2006, all pertussis testing has been 
conducted in a centralized laboratory 
using real-time polymerase chain 
reaction (PCR) on nasopharyngeal 
swabs.1
Study Population
This study followed infants born 
in KPNC hospitals from 2010 to 
2015 starting from the day of birth. 
Eligibility criteria required that 
infants were born full term (≥37 
weeks’ gestation) and were enrolled 
in Kaiser health plan by age 4 
months. We additionally restricted 
the study population to infants 
whose mothers were continuously 
enrolled in Kaiser during pregnancy 
to ensure correct classification of 
Tdap status. We also required that 
mothers be born before 1996 so that 
all the mothers had received whole-
cell rather than acellular pertussis 
vaccines for their primary series. 
We identified pertussis cases among 
eligible infants during follow-up. We

defined cases as testing PCR positive 
for pertussis.
This study had 2 overlapping 
follow-up periods: birth to 2 months 
of age and birth to 1 year of age. 
We started infant follow-up on the 
day of birth and continued until 
the newborn tested positive for 
pertussis, reached 2 or 12 months of 
age (depending on the analysis), or 
the end of the study period (March 
31, 2016). For the 1-year follow-up 
period, we also stopped following 
infants who disenrolled from Kaiser 
before their first birthday.
Statistical Methods
The analyses estimated the 
effectiveness of Tdap vaccination 
during pregnancy in protecting 
newborns against pertussis in 2 
follow-up periods: the first 2 months 
of life and the first year of life. For 
each follow-up period, we modeled 
the risk of pertussis in the infant 
in relation to whether the mother 
received Tdap during pregnancy. 
We used stratified Cox regression to 
estimate the pertussis hazard ratio 
(HR) in infants of women vaccinated 
with Tdap versus women who were 
unvaccinated during pregnancy. We 
calculated VE as 1 – HR.
Cox models were specified with a 
calendar time line and were stratified 
by the year and month of birth of 
the infant. We included covariates to 
adjust for sex, race, delivery hospital, 
and maternal Tdap vaccination 
before and after pregnancy. “Tdap 
before pregnancy” indicated the 
presence or absence of maternal 
Tdap vaccination during the 2 
years before the start of pregnancy. 
“Tdap after pregnancy” was a time-
varying covariate that indicated 
maternal Tdap vaccination from the 
day of birth onwards. The 3 main 
indicator variables of maternal Tdap 
vaccination status in the analyses 
(before pregnancy, during pregnancy 
at least 8 days before birth, and 
after pregnancy) are not exclusive; 
it was possible to receive Tdap 
during >1 of these periods. For the 
1-year follow-up period, we censored 
infants if their mother disenrolled 
from Kaiser to accurately ascertain 
maternal Tdap vaccination status 
after childbirth.
In the analyses that followed infants 
through the first year of life, we also 
included covariates to account for 
infant DTaP doses. We specified DTaP 
vaccination status as a set of time-
varying variables that indicated the 
number of doses received (0, 1, 2, or 
3).
All maternal Tdap and infant 
DTaP vaccine doses were counted 
beginning 8 days after receipt to 
allow time for the immune response.
We identified 3 groups of infants 
based on the Tdap vaccination 
status during pregnancy of their 
birth mother: (1) vaccinated (Tdap 
vaccination during pregnancy at 
least 8 days before birth); or (2) 
vaccinated too close to birth to 
boost maternal antibody transfer 
(Tdap vaccination 1–7 days before 
birth); or (3) unvaccinated (no Tdap 
vaccination during pregnancy). 
Our VE estimate was based on the 
pertussis HR for infants in group 1 
versus group 3.
We ran separate Cox models to 
estimate the VE of maternal Tdap 
during pregnancy in preventing 
infant pertussis during 2 follow-up 
periods: (1) model for the first 2 
months of life (as described above) 
and (2) models for the first 12 
months of life. The first 12-month 
model estimated VE on average 
across the entire first year of life 
with adjustment for the number 
of infant DTaP vaccine doses. This 
model included both sets of pertussis 
vaccination variables (infant DTaP 
vaccine doses, maternal Tdap 
vaccination status during pregnancy) 
as separate covariates. The second 
12-month model examined VE 
at each DTaP vaccine dose. The 
second model yielded 4 separate VE 
estimates for infants while they had 
received 0, 1, 2, and 3 DTaP doses, 
respectively. An 8-level variable 
was created (ie, infants with 0 DTaP 
vaccine doses born to unvaccinated 
mothers; infants with 0 DTaP vaccine 
doses born to vaccinated mothers, 
infants with 1 DTaP vaccine dose 
born to unvaccinated mothers; 
infants with 1 DTaP vaccine dose 
born to vaccinated mothers, etc). 
We performed a sensitivity analysis 
of the second 12-month model that 
censored infants if they became 3 
months late for a DTaP vaccine dose 
to restrict the analysis to infants who 
were following the recommended 
DTaP schedule.
This study was reviewed and 
approved by the KPNC Institutional 
Review Board.
RESULTS
Among all infants born in a KPNC 
hospital from 2006 to 2015, 
the percentage whose mothers 
received the Tdap vaccine during 
pregnancy increased from <1% in 
2006 to 2008 to 11.9% in 2010 and 
to 87.4% by 2015, after the ACIP 
recommendations and reminders in 
the electronic medical record (Fig 
1). The majority of pregnant women 
vaccinated in KPNC from 2010 to 
2015 received the Tdap vaccine at 
≥20 weeks’ gestation (75.1% for 
infants born between 2010 and 2012 
and 98.4% for infants born between 
2013 and 2015); by 2013, most 
pregnant women were vaccinated 
between 27 and 36 weeks’ gestation 
(44.8% for infants born between 
2010 and 2012 and 91.7% for infants 
born between 2013 and 2015). The 
percentage of mothers who received 
the Tdap vaccine during postpartum 
days 0 to 14 peaked at 31.7% for 
infants born in 2010 and declined 
thereafter to 1.8% for infants born 
in 2015.
The study population consisted of 
148 981 infants born from 2010, 
when KPNC began recommending 
Tdap vaccination in pregnancy,

through 2015. Table 1 shows the 
characteristics of newborns in the 
study. The mothers of 68 168 infants, 
45.8% of the study population, 
received the Tdap vaccine during 
pregnancy at least 8 days before 
birth. Seventeen infants (11.4 
per 100 000 infants) in the study 
population tested positive for 
pertussis by 2 months of age, and 
110 (73.8 per 100 000 infants) 
tested positive by 1 year of age. Of 
the 110 pertussis cases in the first 
year of life, 103 were included in the 
analyses after censoring criteria for 
disenrollment were applied.
The unadjusted pertussis incidence 
was lower in infants whose mothers 
were vaccinated versus infants 
whose mothers were not vaccinated 
during pregnancy. Of the 17 cases 
in the first 2 months of life, only 1 
was a “breakthrough” case where 
the mother was vaccinated in 
pregnancy >7 days prior to birth. The 
unadjusted incidence rate ratio was 
0.08 (95% confidence interval [CI], 
0.00 to 0.43) for the first 2 months of 
life and 0.35 (95% CI, 0.21 to 0.55) 
for the entire first year of life.
Maternal Tdap vaccination during 
pregnancy reduced pertussis risk 
by an estimated 91.4% during the 
first 2 months of life (Table 2). 
During the entire first year of life, 
maternal Tdap vaccination during 
pregnancy reduced pertussis risk by 
an estimated 69.0%, after adjustment 
for the effects of DTaP vaccination.
Tdap VE for infants who had 0 DTaP 
doses (from birth through 7 days 
after the first dose) was estimated 
at 87.9%; Tdap VE for infants who 
had protection from 1 DTaP dose 
(ie, from day 8 after dose 1 through 
day 7 of dose 2) was an estimated 
81.4%; Tdap VE for infants who had 
protection from 2 DTaP doses, but 
not yet 3 doses, was an estimated 
6.4%; and Tdap VE for infants who 
had 3 DTaP doses was an estimated 
65.9% (Table 3). The VE at each DTaP 
dose was similar in the sensitivity 
analysis that censored infants who 
received DTaP at ages older than 
recommended (results not shown).
Maternal Tdap after pregnancy did 
not significantly reduce pertussis 
risk. Pertussis severity in the 17

ranged from mild to requiring 
hospitalization. Within 5 days before 
or after the PCR test, all infants 
received a diagnosis of cough or 
pertussis and/or had pertussis 
symptoms (eg, cough, apnea) and 
all received a prescription for 
azithromycin or erythromycin. 
Within 30 days before or after 
the PCR test, 10 of the 17 infants 
were hospitalized for pertussis, 
and an additional 3 had emergency 
department visits related or possibly 
related to pertussis. The 1 case 
born to a mother vaccinated during 
pregnancy had a mild illness and was 
treated as an outpatient. All infants 
recovered without sequelae, and no 
death occurred.
DISCUSSION
We demonstrated a high level of 
effectiveness of 88% for maternal 
Tdap vaccination during pregnancy 
in preventing pertussis in infants 
before their first dose of DTaP. This 
result is consistent with 2 earlier 
studies in the United Kingdom. 
Both studies examined maternal 
Tdap VE in preventing pertussis in 
infants <3 months of age, before any 
DTaP vaccination. The first, using 
a screening method, estimated VE 
at 90% (95% CI, 82 to 95).25 The 
second, a case-control study, found

a VE of maternal Tdap vaccination during pregnancy was estimated from a Cox regression model, stratified on the year and month of birth of the infant and including covariates to adjust 
for sex, race, delivery hospital, maternal Tdap vaccination before and after pregnancy, and, for the 12-mo follow-up period, number of infant DTaP doses. Case counts do not include 1 
infant, where maternal Tdap vaccination occurred 1 to 7 days before birth, because the VE estimate is based on comparing infants whose mothers received the Tdap vaccine during 
pregnancy at least 8 days before birth versus infants whose mothers had no Tdap vaccination during pregnancy. The VE estimate does not include infants whose mothers were vaccinated 
1 to 7 days before birth as either vaccinated or unvaccinated during pregnancy; there were too few infants in this group to give a meaningful result, so the 1 case where this occurred 
is not included.

a We calculated the VE of maternal Tdap vaccination during pregnancy after each infant DTaP vaccine dose based on a Cox regression model that included an 8-level variable created by 
interacting a 2-level Tdap variable (0 = unvaccinated during pregnancy, 1 = vaccinated during pregnancy 8+ days before birth) and a 4-level DTaP variable (0, 1, 2, or 3 doses). The model 
was stratified on the year and month of birth of the infant and included covariates to adjust for sex, race, delivery hospital, and maternal Tdap before and after pregnancy. We used 
contrast statements to estimate the VE of maternal Tdap vaccination during pregnancy after each infant DTaP dose. Case counts do not include 1 infant whose mother received the Tdap 
vaccine 1 to 7 days before birth because the VE estimates do not include infants whose mothers were vaccinated 1 to 7 days before birth as either vaccinated or unvaccinated during 
pregnancy; there were too few infants in this group to give a meaningful result, so the 1 case where this occurred is not included.

VE to be 93% (95% CI, 81 to 97).21 In 
addition, a recent US study compared 
Tdap vaccination during pregnancy 
with Tdap vaccination after 
pregnancy and estimated that Tdap 
vaccination during 27 to 36 weeks’ 
gestation was 85% more effective 
than postpartum Tdap vaccination in 
preventing pertussis in infants up to 
8 weeks of age.26
In addition to finding a high VE in 
the first 2 months of life (91%), our 
study also demonstrated  
that maternal Tdap vaccination 
confers a significant amount of 
protection against pertussis over 
the entire first year of life (69%), 
even after infants are immunized 
with DTaP.
Most previous studies evaluated 
maternal Tdap VE in infants before 
DTaP vaccination. We evaluated 
the effectiveness of Tdap during 
pregnancy in relation to the first 
3 doses of the DTaP vaccine. This 
is important because of concerns 
that maternal Tdap vaccination 
and infant DTaP vaccination 
may interfere with each other, 
potentially leading to decreased 
protection for the infant.27 Evidence 
of such interference would be a 
negative VE estimate for maternal 
Tdap vaccination after infant 
DTaP vaccination, or lower-than-
expected VE estimates for infant 
DTaP vaccination. We found neither 
type of evidence for interference. 
Protection from pertussis after 
maternal Tdap vaccination was high 
(>80%) both before and after the 
first infant dose of DTaP. After the 
second dose of DTaP and before 
the third dose, the point estimate 
of VE fell to 6.4%, with a wide CI, 
due to few pertussis cases and the 
modest difference in incidence rates 
during the brief follow-up time 
between doses 2 and 3. The Tdap 
VE estimate increased to 65.9%, and 
the CIs narrowed again after the 
third dose. We should be cautious 
about the interpretation of how 
much additional protection infants 
are provided by maternal Tdap 
vaccination in addition to DTaP 
vaccination between the second 
and third doses, because the CI 
is wide. However, it is reassuring 
that at every level of DTaP vaccine 
exposure, children whose mothers 
received the Tdap vaccine are 
better protected. These results are 
broadly consistent with those from a 
recent study in the United Kingdom 
that also found that infants whose 
mothers received the Tdap vaccine 
were more protected at each of the 
first 3 doses of the DTaP vaccine. 
Using a screening method, 
28 this 
study found a similarly high Tdap 
VE after the first DTaP vaccine 
dose (82%; 95% CI, 65 to 91), but 
a higher VE after the second dose 
(69%; 95% CI, 8 to 90) and a lower 
VE after the third dose (29%; 95% 
CI, −112 to 76), with a small number 
of cases and imprecise estimates 
after the second and, especially, the 
third dose.23
Overall, the results in this study 
demonstrate that maternal Tdap 
vaccination during pregnancy 
is highly effective in preventing 
pertussis in infants. The 
protection afforded by Tdap 
vaccine administration during 
pregnancy was higher than that 
by Tdap vaccine administration 
after pregnancy (the cocooning 
strategy). Notably, we did not find 
evidence that postpartum Tdap 
administration to mothers was 
significantly protective during either 
the first 2 months or the first year 
of life. Our results demonstrate the 
substantial benefit of vaccinating 
during pregnancy rather than 
waiting until after birth and provide 
strong support for the current US 
recommendation to mothers and 
their medical providers to vaccinate 
with Tdap during pregnancy.
Receipt of the Tdap vaccine in 
the 2 years before the current 
pregnancy also appeared to provide 
some protection from pertussis. 
However, the results of this study 
demonstrate that maternal Tdap 
vaccination during pregnancy 
provided the best protection 
against pertussis.
This study used data from a 
large integrated medical system 
in California over a time period 
encompassing 2 pertussis epidemics, 
which allowed us to accrue enough 
pertussis cases to assess VE before 
and after each of the 3 infant 
pertussis doses. We stratified the 
analyses by year and month of birth 
so that infants with pertussis were 
only compared with other infants 
of nearly the same age. The time-
varying covariates (postpartum 
maternal Tdap vaccination and 
infant DTaP vaccine dose) were 
measured each day that a pertussis 
case occurred, and the exposure 
status for the case was compared 
with the exposure status on the 
same day for all other infants still 
being followed. Because we used 
calendar time as the time scale in 
the Cox regression model, cases 
were only compared with other 
infants at risk on the same day. 
Careful adjustment for calendar time 
is important because pertussis risk 
varies markedly as outbreaks come 
and go and because the rates of Tdap 
immunization of pregnant women 
rose substantially over the study 
period.
In some analyses, the number of 
pertussis cases was low, so CIs 
were wide, as was the case after the 
second dose of the DTaP vaccine. 
Because a large majority of mothers 
were vaccinated between 27 and 
36 weeks’ gestation, we did not 
have power to assess the optimal 
timing of Tdap vaccination during 
pregnancy. We restricted our 
study to mothers who had received 
whole-cell pertussis vaccines in 
infancy, so our results may not 
be generalizable to the coming 
generation of mothers vaccinated 
entirely with DTaP in childhood.

Finally, the decision of whether to 
test an infant was clinical, and we 
may not have had complete case 
ascertainment if physicians did not 
test for pertussis or parents did not 
seek care.
CONCLUSIONS
Maternal Tdap vaccination during 
pregnancy was highly effective 
at protecting infants against 
pertussis before their first dose of 
the DTaP vaccine, and protection 
continued after the first DTaP dose 
through the first year of life. We 
did not find evidence supporting 
the effectiveness of maternal 
postpartum cocooning with the 
Tdap vaccine. Our study validates 
the current US recommendation 
to vaccinate with Tdap during 
pregnancy, and suggests that 
widespread use of Tdap vaccination 
in pregnancy can result in 
significant decreases in pertussis, 
particularly in young infants before 
their first DTaP vaccine dose or 
who are protected by only 1 dose of 
DTaP.
