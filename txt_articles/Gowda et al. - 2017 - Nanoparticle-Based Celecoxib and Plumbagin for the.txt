Abstract
Using multiple drugs to kill cancer cells can decrease drug
resistance development. However, this approach is frequently
limited by the bioavailability and toxicity of the combined agents
and delivery at ratios to specific locations that synergistically kill
cancer cells. Loading the individual agents into a nanoparticle that
releases the drugs at synergizing ratios at a single location is one
approach to resolve this concern. Celecoxib and plumbagin are
two drugs that were identified from a screen to synergistically
kill melanoma cells compared with normal cells. Combined
use of these agents by traditional approaches was not possible
due to poor bioavailability and toxicologic concerns. This
study details the development of a nanoliposomal-based
agent
containing
celecoxib
and
plumbagin,
called
Cele-
Plum-777, which is stable and releases these drugs at an
optimal ratio for maximal synergistic killing efficacy. Cele-
Plum-777 was more effective at killing melanoma than nor-
mal cells and inhibited xenograft melanoma tumor growth by
up to 72% without apparent toxicity. Mechanistically, the drug
combination in CelePlum-777 led to enhanced inhibition of
melanoma cell proliferation mediated by decreasing levels of
key cyclins important for cancer cell proliferation and survival,
which was not observed with the individual agents. Thus, a
novel nanoparticle-based drug has been developed containing
celecoxib and plumbagin that lacks toxicity and delivers the
agents at a synergistically killing drug ratio to kill cancer cells.

Introduction
Despite the development of targeted pathway inhibitors and
immune system modulators in melanoma, recurrent resistant
disease development remains a problem (1). One emerging
research area to address this issue has been to screen for phar-
macologic agents that synergize with one another to decrease the
occurrence of resistant disease (2). However, this approach is
frequently hindered by the individual drugs having unique sol-
ubility, bioavailability, toxicity profiles, and limiting drug com-
patibility (3, 4). Furthermore, the mechanism of action of the
drug combination causing enhanced efficacy has generally been
difficult to ascertain (5). Nanotechnology is one approach
being used to resolve these issues, which involves loading the
drugs into a single nanoparticle at synergizing drug ratios (6).
The nanoparticle simultaneously delivers the agents to tumor
cells, releasing the drugs at the optimized synergizing ratio, and
as there are two cooperating drugs, there can be decreased
resistance development (6). A further advantage is that the
FDA evaluates nanoparticles containing multiple active ingre-
dients as a single drug product rather than two separate ones,
which could significantly reduce costs and potentially move the
agent more quickly to the clinic (7).
This study details the development of a nanoparticle contain-
ing celecoxib and plumbagin agents that were identified from
a screen to synergistically kill melanoma cells. The NSAID
celecoxib inhibits COX-2 activity (8). COX-2 is an inducible
enzyme that plays an important role in the production of
prostaglandin E2 (PGE2; ref. 8). COX-2 is overexpressed in
carcinomas of the colon, breast, lung, prostate, cervix, stomach,
and skin (9, 10). In melanoma cells, the key target modulated by
celecoxib is COX-2, which plays an important role in the
development of 50% to 70% of tumors (11). Celecoxib inhibits
COX-2 activity, thereby reducing the production of PGE2 (8),
leading to a compensatory increase in COX-2 protein levels (12).
PGE2 affects cellular proliferation, motility, invasiveness, angio-
genesis, and promotes survival by inhibiting apoptosis (12). In
addition, PGE2 is a tumor-inducing eicosanoid that promotes
tumor growth and more invasive disease (13, 14). Celecoxib can
have negative side effects depending on the dose and rate at
which it is administered (15). Concentrations of celecoxib
required to induce apoptosis of cultured cancer cells are high,
ranging from 25 to 100 mmol/L, and use at these concentrations
in animals, which would be equivalent to 200 mg per day, causes
negative cardiovascular side effects (15, 16).

 Plumbagin (5-hydroxy-2-methyl-1, 4-napthoquinone) is a
quinoid isolated from the roots of the Plumbago zeylanica plant
(17). Plumbagin retards the growth of various cancer types
(18), and topical treatment inhibits UV radiation–induced
squamous cell carcinomas in mice (19). Therapeutic use of
plumbagin has been limited due to toxicity and poor aqueous
solubility (19). Plumbagin has antibacterial, antifungal, and
anticancer properties by suppression of NF-kB, AKT/mTOR,
STAT3, induction of ROS, p53, JNK, and/or activation of the
NRF2–ARE signaling pathway (20–23). Of these proteins, the
key target modulated in cancers by plumbagin is STAT3, which
plays an important role in the development of 50% to 70% of
many cancer types (20, 21, 23).
The COX-2 and STAT3 pathways inhibited by celecoxib and
plumbagin, respectively, are activated in 50% to 70% of mela-
noma patients, reducing cellular apoptosis, increasing prolifera-
tion, and aiding an invasive phenotype (24, 25). An oral formu-
lation of these agents is not feasible due to drug incompatibility
involving solubility, bioavailability, and toxicity (26–28). In this
study, a single nanoparticle has been developed called CelePlum-
777, containing celecoxib and plumbagin. As the drugs are
encapsulated in a lipid shell, they are soluble when administered
intravenously, and the agents are released simultaneously from
the nanoparticle at the synergizing ratio making them bioavail-
able at the optimized effective drug levels, and as the agents
synergize, lower concentration of each would be required, thereby
decreasing toxicity. CelePlum-777 inhibited xenograft melanoma
tumor growth by up to 72% without apparent systemic toxicity.
Mechanistically, the synergizing agents simultaneously inhibited
COX-2 and STAT3 in melanomas, which enhanced the antipro-
liferative effect mediated by a more efficient reduction in key
cyclins important in melanoma cell survival.
Materials and Methods
Cell lines and culture conditions
Normal human primary melanocytes NHEM 558 was obtained
from Lonza in 2001. Normal human fibroblast FF2441 and
foreskin keratinocyte HFK were provided by Dr. Craig Myers
between 2005 and 2006 (Penn State College of Medicine, Her-
shey, PA). Mutant V600E-BRAF human melanoma cell line 1205
Lu was provided by Dr. Herlyn in 2003 (Wistar Institute, Phila-
delphia, PA), and UACC 903 was provided by Dr. Mark Nelson
between 1995 and 1999 (University of Arizona, Tucson, AZ).
Wild-type BRAF melanoma cell lines; C8161.Cl9 was provided by
Dr. Danny Welch in 2003 (University of Kansas, Kansas City, KS),
and MelJuSo was provided by Dr. Judith Johnson between 1995
and 1999 (Institute for Immunology, Germany). Cell lines were
maintained in a 37�C humidified 5% CO2 atmosphere incubator
and periodically monitored for phenotypic and genotypic char-
acteristics, and tumorigenic potential to validate and confirm cell
line identity. Last assessment was within the last 6 months.
Screening to identify agents that synergize with plumbagin
Plumbagin was screened together with in-house anticancer
agents. For the initial screen, 5 � 103 UACC 903 melanoma cells
were seeded into 96-well plates for 24 hours. Cells were then
treated with 5 mmol/L of plumbagin singlyorin combination with
the drug library at concentration ranging from 0.5 to 100 mmol/L
for 72 hours. Cell viability was measured by MTS assay (Promega;
refs. 29–31).
Synergy analysis when treating cultured cells with plumbagin
and celecoxib dissolved in DMSO
UACC 903 cells were seeded into a 96-well plate at a density of
5 � 103 cells per well in 100 mL of media and grown for 48 hours.
Cells were then treated with 30 to 50 mmol/L of celecoxib (Sigma)
or 5 mmol/L of plumbagin (Sigma) singly or in combination for
72 hours. Cell viability was measured by MTS assay. Potential
synergy between the drugs was assessed using the Chou–Talalay
method to estimate the combination index (CI) using CalcuSyn
software (32, 33). The CI values of <0.9 were considered syner-
gistic, >1.1 considered antagonistic, and values 0.9–1.1 consid-
ered as additive (32, 33).
Thermal stability of plumbagin and celecoxib
To determine whether these compounds would be stable
during the synthesis of nanoparticles, the thermal stability of
plumbagin and celecoxib in DMSO solution was assessed at
various time points at 60�C. UACC 903 cells (5 � 103 cells per
well) in 100 mL of media were seeded and grown in a 96-well plate
for 48 hours and then treated with agents for 72 hours. Efficacy of
the heat-treated compounds for killing UACC 903 melanoma
cells was assessed by MTS assay.
Manufacture of CelePlum-777 containing celecoxib and
plumbagin
Celecoxib and plumbagin drugs alone or in combination at
2.5:1, 5:1, 10:1, or 20:1 ratio were encapsulated into a nanolipo-
some called CelePlum-777 by combining L-a-phosphatidylcho-
line (ePC) and 1,2-dipalmitoyl-sn-glycero-3-phosphoethanola-
mine-N- [methoxy(polyethylene glycol)-2000] ammonium salt
(DPPE-PEG-2000) in chloroform at 95:5 mol % for a final lipid
concentration of 25 mg/mL (Avanti Polar Lipids). The solvent was
removed and the mixture was dried under nitrogen gas followed
by resuspension in sterile saline solution or water at 60�C with
vortexing every 5 minutes over a 20-minute period, followed by
sonication and extrusion at 60�C through a 100-nm polycarbon-
ate membrane using an Avanti Mini Extruder (Avanti Polar
Lipids). The particle size and zeta potential were measured using
a Malvern Zetasizer (Malvern Instruments; ref. 28).
Characterization of CelePlum-777
Drug encapsulation. Encapsulation of celecoxib and plumbagin
singly or in combination at a ratio of 20:1 in the liposomal
formulation was estimated by UV–visible spectrophotometry
(SpectraMax M2 plate reader; Molecular Devices; ref. 34). Free
drugs not incorporated into the nanoliposomes were separated
using 10-kDa Centricon filter tube (Millipore). CelePlum-777
liposomal solution (1.0 mL) was taken in 10-kDa Centricon filter
tube, followed by centrifugation at 3,750 rpm for 30 minutes.
Next, 0.5 mL of purified liposomal solution was combined with
0.5 mL of 1:1 ratio of chloroform and methanol to destroy the
liposomal structure and release the drug into the solution. Fol-
lowing vortexing for 10 minutes, the precipitated lipids were
separated following centrifugation at 10,000 rpm for 15 minutes.
The supernatant was then used to measure the amount of each
respective drug alone or in combination, and concentrations were
calculated from a standard curve of plumbagin or celecoxib
ranging from 0.01 to 0.1 mg/mL. Chloroform and methanol ratio
1:1 was used as the reference blank. The percentage of drug
incorporated in the liposome was calculated as the free drug(s)/
total drug(s) � 100.

 Stability. Stability of CelePlum-777 stored at 4�C was measured at
various time intervals over 1 to 6 weeks. During this period, no
aggregation or precipitation of the liposomes was observed.
Assessing stability involved comparing size and zeta potential
using the Malvern Zetasizer as well as assessing efficacy for killing
UACC 903 melanoma cells using the MTS assay (28).
In vitro drug release kinetics of CelePlum-777. The in vitro release
kinetics of the compounds contained in CelePlum-777 was
estimated at room temperature following dialysis through a
molecular weight cutoff of 25 kDa membrane (Spectra Por;
ref. 35). Purified CelePlum-777 solution (1.0 mL) in saline or
water was placed into a dialysis membrane bag and suspended in
1 L of 10 mmol/L reduced glutathione. Samples of the CelePlum-
777 solution (0.05 mL) contained in the dialysis bag were
removed at various time intervals (from 0.5 to 96 hours), and
the amount of celecoxib and plumbagin released at each time
point was estimated using UV–visible spectrophotometry as
detailed in ref. 34.
Assessment of cell viability, proliferation, and apoptosis following
treatment of CelePlum-777 in cultured melanoma cells. A total of
5 � 103 cells per well in 100 mL of media were seeded and grown in
a 96-well plate for 48 or 72 hours, respectively, for those repre-
senting normal cells (NHEM 558-melanocytes, FF2441-fibro-
blast, and HFK-keratinocytes) and melanoma cell lines (UACC
903, 1205 Lu, C8161.Cl9, and MelJuSo). Each cell line was treated
with empty control liposome, plumbagin liposome (5 mmol/L),
celecoxib liposome (100 mmol/L), or CelePlum-777 (containing
100 mmol/L celecoxib þ 5 mmol/L plumbagin) for 24, 48, or 72
hours and viability measured by MTS assay (11, 36, 37). Rates of
proliferation and apoptosis were measured by using a colorimet-
ric cell proliferation ELISA BrdU Kit (Roche Diagnostics) or Apo-
ONE Homogeneous Caspase-3/7 Assay Kit (Promega), respec-
tively. Data represents averages of at least three independent
experiments; bars represent SEM.
Western blot analysis
Cell lysates from UACC 903 or 1205 Lu melanoma cell lines
treated with empty control liposome, 100 mmol/L celecoxib
liposome, 5 mmol/L plumbagin liposome, or CelePlum-777
(containing 100 mmol/L celecoxib þ 5 mmol/L plumbagin) for
6 or 24 hours were prepared in RIPA lysis buffer containing Halt
Protease and Phosphatase Inhibitor Cocktail (Thermo Scientific;
refs. 29–31). Blots were probed with antibodies according to each
supplier's recommendations: antibodies to AKT (pan) (11E7),
phospho AKT (S473), cleaved PARP (Asp 214), phospho STAT3
(Y705), STAT3, cyclin H, cyclin B1, caspase 3, cyclin A2, cyclin E1,
cyclin E2, cPLA2, and phospho cPLA2 (S505) from Cell Signaling
Technology; cyclin D1, Erk2, p21, p27, COX-1, COX-2, alpha-
enolase, and secondary antibodies conjugated with horseradish
peroxidase from Santa Cruz Biotechnology. Immunoblots were
developed using the enhanced chemiluminescence detection
system or SuperSignal West Femto Chemiluminescent Substrate
(Thermo Fisher Scientific).
Analysis of caspase-3/7 activity in total cell lysates
Caspase-3/7 activity in the cell lysates collected for Western blot
analysis was used to determine the Apo-ONE Homogeneous
Caspase-3/7 Activity Assay Kit (Promega Corporation; ref. 36).
In brief, 30 to 40 mg in 50 mL lysis buffer was incubated with
caspase-3/7 substrate (R110-Z-DEVD dissolved in caspase-3/7
assay buffer) for 4 hours at 37�C with constant shaking in a light
protected container. Amount of R110 released was determined
using a SpectraMax-M2 plate reader at a 485 nm excitation and
520 nm emission wavelengths. Average relative fluorescence units
values from duplicate wells were plotted as a bar graph.
Tumorigenicity assessments
Animal experiments to assess the efficacy of drug treatment
were performed according to protocols approved by the Institu-
tional Animal Care and Use Committee at Pennsylvania State
University (Hershey, PA). Tumor kinetics were measured by
subcutaneous injection of 1 � 106 UACC 903 or 1205 Lu cells
above both left and right rib cages of 4- to 6-week-old female
athymic-Foxn1nu nude mice (Harlan Sprague Dawley; refs. 28,
29). Six days later, when a fully vascularized tumor had formed,
mice were randomly divided into 7 different groups and treated
intravenously on alternate days for 3 to 4 weeks. Body weight in
grams and dimensions of developing tumors in mm3 was mea-
sured on alternate days: group 1 (empty liposomes); group 2
(celecoxib liposome, 15 mg/kg bodyweight); group 3 (plumbagin
liposome, 0.75 mg/kg bodyweight); group 4 (plumbagin lipo-
some, 1.5 mg/kg bodyweight); group 5 (20:1 ratio of CelePlum-
777; celecoxib 15 mg/kg þ plumbagin 0.75 mg/kg bodyweight);
group 6 (10:1 ratio of CelePlum-777; celecoxib 15 mg/kg þ
plumbagin 1.5 mg/kg bodyweight); and group 7 (10:1 ratio
combined liposomes containing the individual agents of cel-
ecoxib liposome; 15 mg/kg þ plumbagin liposome; 1.5 mg/kg
bodyweight).
Size- and time-matched tumors for analysis of biological
processes regulating tumor development
1205 Lu cells (2.5 � 106) were injected subcutaneously into
nude mice, generating tumors of the same size developing at
parallel time points. Six days later, mice were treated daily with
liposomes containing celecoxib at 15 mg/kg bodyweight, plum-
bagin at 1.5 mg/kg bodyweight, or CelePlum-777 containing
celecoxib 15 mg/kg þ plumbagin 1.5 mg/kg bodyweight daily
for up to 15 days. Empty liposome in saline was used as a vehicle
control. Tumors were harvested at days 13 and 15 for comparison
of rates of cellular proliferation, apoptosis, and vessel density by
IHC (38). Cell proliferation was measured using mouse anti-
human Ki-67 antibody staining (BD Pharmingen). Apoptosis
rates were measured using the terminal deoxynucleotidyl trans-
ferase–mediated dUTP nick end labeling (TUNEL) TMR Red
Apoptosis Kit (Roche). Vessel density indicative of angiogenesis
was measured using a purified rat anti-mouse CD31 (PECAM-1)
mAb for immunostaining (BD Pharmingen). Numbers of Ki-67 or
TUNEL-stained cells were quantified as the percentage of total
cells in tumors using the IPLab Imaging Software program. Areas
containing vessels were quantified and compared between tumor
sections. For all tumor analyses, a minimum of 4 to 6 different
tumors with 4 to 6 fields per tumor section were analyzed.
Toxicity assessments
At the end of tumorigenicity assessment treatment, blood was
collected from each euthanized animal in a serum separator tube
with lithium heparin (BD Microtainer) following cardiac punc-
ture and analyzed for levels of GLU (glucose), BUN (blood urea
nitrogen), CREA (creatinine), phosphate, TP (total protein), CAL
(calcium), GLO (globulin), ALT (alanine aminotransferase),

Results
Combining celecoxib with plumbagin led to synergistic killing
of melanoma cells
To identify an agent that synergizes with plumbagin, a small
library of compounds was screened to identify those that coop-
eratively kill UACC 903 melanoma cells, which identified cel-
ecoxib as a potential candidate (data not shown). To further
validate the initial screen, UACC 903 cells were treated with
various concentration of plumbagin (3–5 mmol/L) combined
with 30, 40, 50 mmol/L celecoxib for 72 hours. Simultaneous
treatment with plumbagin (3–5 mmol/L) or celecoxib (30–50
mmol/L) killed UACC 903 cells, while the single agents alone had
a negligible effect (Fig. 1A; Supplementary Fig. S1). To determine
whether the killing effect was additive or synergistic, the Chou–
Talalay method was used for determining the CI values using
CalcuSyn software (32). Using this approach, CI values <0.9 are
considered synergistic, >1.1 are antagonistic, and values 0.9 to 1.1
are additive (32). CI values were 0.83, 0.80, and 0.74 for 30, 40,
and 50 mmol/L of celecoxib plus 5 mmol/L of plumbagin, respec-
tively, demonstrating a strong synergistic killing effect (Fig. 1B).
Thus, treatment of cultured UACC 903 melanoma cells with
celecoxib and plumbagin at ratios of 10:1 led to cooperatively
synergistic inhibition. On the basis of this observation, ratios of
10:1 and 20:1 were selected for subsequent studies in cultured
cells and in animals.
Development of a nanoliposome containing celecoxib and
plumbagin at a drug ratio of 10:1 or 20:1 called CelePlum-777
Combining celecoxib and plumbagin for oral animal treatment
is limited by solubility, bioavailability, and toxicity (15, 39).
Furthermore, solubilizing the agents in DMSO for intravenous
administration would cause animal lethality, and use of intra-
peritoneal or subcutaneous administration is not a viable option
for human use. Therefore, encapsulation of both agents into a
single nanoparticle was selected as an approach to overcome poor
bioavailability, toxicity, and solubility issues related to these
agents (40). To create a viable nanoparticle containing both
celecoxib and plumbagin, certain feasibility assessment needed
to be undertaken. These involved assessing compound thermal
stability, identifying the optimal liposomal lipid composition,
and determining whether sufficient amount of each compound at
the optimal synergizing ratio could be loaded into the lipid shell
of the liposome. Agent's thermostability was measured by heating
plumbagin or celecoxib at 60�C overtime and then measuring
efficacy for killing UACC 903 cells by MTS assay (Supplementary
Fig. S2). Celecoxib could be heated for up to 30 minutes without
decreasing efficacy (Supplementary Fig. S2A), and prolonged
heating of plumbagin did not affect its inhibitory activity (Sup-
plementary Fig. S2B).
To identify the optimal lipid formulation to enable loading of
sufficient quantities of celecoxib or plumbagin into liposomes,
several formulations were evaluated and results assessed for size,
zeta potential, membrane fluidity, and surface hydration (28).
A PEGylated liposomal system made of 95:5 mol % for
ePC: DPPE PEG-2000 was selected to form a stable liposome
approximately 70 nm in size. To demonstrate that sufficient
quantities of celecoxib and plumbagin could be loaded into the
lipid shell of the liposomes, individual celecoxib liposomes were
made containing 2, 3, and 4 mg of compound (Supplementary
Table S1). Those made with 3 and 4 mg crashed, which set the
maximal amount of celecoxib that could be loaded. Liposomes
containing 0.2, 0.4, and 0.8 mg of plumbagin were all viable
(Supplementary Table S1). On the basis of these results, it was
predicted that a liposomal formulation could be made contain-
ing 2 mg of celecoxib and 0.1 mg of plumbagin giving a ratio of
20:1 or 2 mg of celecoxib and 0.2 mg of plumbagin giving a ratio
of 10:1 (Supplementary Table S1). The same lipid formulation
was also found to be suitable for making a control empty
liposome, one containing celecoxib or plumbagin alone and
one containing both drugs at ratios of 10:1 or 20:1 that was
optimized to attain the best drug ratio for maximal potency and
tested on the UACC 903 melanoma cell line (Supplementary Fig.
S3). These liposomes were made and dissolved in saline or water
and found to be viable, which is diagrammatically shown in Fig.
1C. Size of the liposomes in water ranged from 66 to 81 nm, and
zeta potential charge was �56 to �64 mV, whereas in saline, the
size ranged from 68 to 74 nm with a zeta potential charge of �0.9
to �1.8 mV (Fig. 1D).
Physiochemical and stability characterization of CelePlum-777
The entire drug was solubilized during liposome manufacture,
but a certain amount was loosely bound to the exterior lipids of
the nanoparticle. To measure the proportion encapsulated in the
lipid shell, free loosely bound or free drug was removed by
Centricon ultracentrifugation, followed by lysis of the liposomes.
The amount of each drug in the lipid shell was then estimated by
determining the quantity present at the absorption maxima of
the compound extrapolated from a standard curve of celecoxib
or plumbagin ranging from 0.01 to 0.1 mg/mL. Encapsulation for
celecoxib or plumbagin in liposomes containing each agent alone
was 91% and 75%, respectively (Fig. 2A). Encapsulation of
celecoxib and plumbagin in CelePlum-777 liposomes was
89.3% and 67.6%, respectively (Fig. 2A). To demonstrate that
the nanoparticles release the drugs at similar ratios to maintain the
20:1 or 10:1 synergistic killing ratio, drug release kinetics was
examined by dialyzing CelePlum-777 in 10 mmol/L glutathione
over 96 hours, the liposome lysed, and the remaining drugs
estimated from a standard curve (Fig. 2B). Celecoxib and plum-
bagin release occurred at a steady rate over 96 hours (Fig. 2B), and
as the drugs were loaded at 10:1 and 20:1 ratios, the similar release

 kinetics suggested that drugs would be freed from the nanopar-
ticle at a rate that would maintain the synergistic effects of the
agents. Long-term storage of CelePlum-777 was measured by
storage in sterile saline at 4�C and sampled over 6 weeks to assess
size, zeta potential, and efficacy for killing UACC 903 melanoma
cells. Size and charge remained consistent over 6 weeks. For up to
5 weeks, CelePlum-777 retained killing efficacy above 80%, but
at week 5, killing efficacy decreased to 56% (Fig. 2C). Thus,
CelePlum-777 can be stored at 4�C for up to 5 weeks without
changes in the physiochemical or killing properties.

keratinocytes; Fig. 3A) and melanoma cells UACC 903 or 1205
Lu (Fig. 3B) was compared with empty liposomes or those
containing only celecoxib or plumbagin for 24, 48, and 72
hours by MTS assay. For normal cell lines (the fibroblasts,
keratinocytes, or melanocytes), a general observation was that
at least one of the single agents led to a decrease in cell viability
that was equivalent to the killing observed with the drug
combination (Fig. 3A). Only for keratinocytes at the 48-hour
time point was a slight difference in cell killing for the drug
combination that was statistically significant from the plum-
bagin treatment on its own. As this only occurred at the 48-hour
time point and not at the other two times, this was attributed to
a slight variance in the experimental outcome. Therefore, one of
the two drugs decreased normal cell proliferation alone or in
combination with the other agent, and the killing was not
synergistic. In the case of the melanoma cell lines, the com-
bined agents were in every case significantly more effective in
killing the melanoma cells than both of the agents on their
own, suggesting cooperation in a synergistic fashion. Thus,
there was no synergistic killing of the normal cell, but it did
occur for the melanoma cell lines where the killing for the
combined drugs was clearly synergistic (Fig. 3A). In contrast,
melanoma cells treated with CelePlum-777 were more effec-
tively killed than those treated with empty liposomes or those
containing celecoxib or plumbagin alone (Fig. 3B). Compara-
ble results were also obtained with C8161.Cl9 (wild-type
BRAF) and MelJuSo (wild-type BRAF and NRAS mutation)

independently of the BRAF mutation status (Supplementary

CelePlum-777 inhibited melanoma tumor growth with
negligible toxicity
To determine whether CelePlum-777 synergistically inhibited
melanoma tumor development, nude mice containing vascular-
ized tumors were treated intravenously with 20:1 ratio of Cel-
ePlum-777 (15 mg/kg celecoxib þ 0.75 mg/kg plumbagin) or
10:1 CelePlum-777 (15 mg/kg celecoxib þ 1.5 mg/kg plumbagin)
based on body weight, on alternate days. CelePlum-777 admin-
istered in water decreased tumor growth by up to 62% in both
UACC 903 (Fig. 4A and B) and 1205 Lu (Fig. 4C and D) xenografts
(P < 0.001, two-way ANOVA). Resuspending CelePlum-777 in
saline (Fig. 4E and F) did not alter the tumor-inhibitory efficacy
leading to tumor inhibition by up to 72%. CelePlum-777 treat-
ment at either the 10:1 or 20:1 drug ratio did not alter animal body

 weight, suggesting negligible toxicity (Fig. 4A–F; insets). No
significant changes in serum parameters indicative of major organ
toxicity were observed (Supplementary Table S2). Analysis of
H&E-stained tissue sections comparing control- or CelePlum-
777-treated mice showed no changes in cellular morphology or
architecture of liver, heart, kidney, spleen, and intestine (Supple-
mentary Fig. S5). Collectively, these results suggested that Cel-
ePlum-777 inhibits xenografted melanoma tumor growth with-
out significant organ-related toxicity.
Tumor-inhibitory efficacy of CelePlum-777 was next com-
pared with nanoliposomes containing only celecoxib or plum-
bagin that were then combined at the synergizing 10:1 ratio.
The purpose was to demonstrate that CelePlum-777 was as
effective as the combined liposomes containing the individual
agents. CelePlum-777 or liposomes containing celecoxib and
plumbagin at the 10:1 ratio led to similar levels of tumor
inhibition (Supplementary Fig. S6).
CelePlum-777 led to enhanced inhibition of melanoma cell
proliferation
To identify the underlying mechanism by which CelePlum-777
synergistically inhibited melanoma tumor growth, an established
published approach was used (38, 41). It involved quantifying the
rates of cell proliferation (using Ki-67 staining), apoptosis (using
TUNEL staining), and tumor angiogenesis (using CD31 staining)
occurring in time- and size-matched tumors treated with 10:1
ratio of CelePlum-777 compared with control-exposed animals.
Size- and time-matched tumors at days 13 and 15 were compared
to identify statistically quantifiable differences in cell prolifera-
tion, apoptosis, or vascular development between CelePlum-777
treatments compared with liposomes containing the individual
drugs. At day 13, a statistically significant reduction of approxi-
mately 50% in proliferating cells (Fig. 5A) and vascular develop-
ment (Fig. 5B) was observed (P < 0.001, two-way ANOVA). In
contrast, there was no significant change in TUNEL-positive cells
in CelePlum-777–treated tumors compared with individual con-
trols (Supplementary Fig. S7). To further confirm the growth
inhibition of cultured cells after treatment with CelePlum-777
compared with controls, the rates of cell proliferation were
measured after 72 hours of treatment. Treatment with liposomes
containing celecoxib or plumbagin reduced melanoma cell pro-
liferation by 20% to 35%, while nanoparticles containing both
agents decreased cell survival by 90% to 95% (Fig. 5C). Thus,
CelePlum-777 cooperatively decreased the proliferative potential

 of melanoma cells compared with the individual agents in both
tumors and cultured cells, suggesting this process led to inhibitory
effects on tumor development. Apoptosis was only evident in
cultured cells and not tumors, suggesting it was not key in the
tumor-inhibitory effect but cell culture specific.
CelePlum-777 inhibited the activity of STAT3 and COX-2 to
cooperatively decrease key cyclin levels to retard melanoma cell
proliferation
To identifythe synergistic effects mediated by CelePlum-777 on
the signaling pathways compared with celecoxib or plumbagin
alone, cells were treated with liposomes containing each agent
alone or CelePlum-777. CelePlum-777 had negligible effects on
the signaling of other pathways, including those of the AKT and
cPLA2 signaling pathways (Supplementary Table S3). The drug
combination consistently led to increased COX-2 levels. For
UACC 903 cells at the 24-hour time point, celecoxib and plum-
bagin increased COX-2 levels, and the effect for the combination
treatment appeared to be additive. It is unclear why plumbagin
increased COX-2 levels, but this also occurred for the 1205 Lu cell
line at 24 hours. Celecoxib did increase COX-2 levels in 1205 Lu
cells but to a significantly lesser extent. Thus, these data suggest
that plumbagin might also be inhibiting COX-2 signaling, which
in turn increases COX-2 levels but this is purely speculative.
However, it is accepted that when celecoxib binds to and inhibits
the activity of COX-2, there is a compensatory increase in protein
expression to alleviate the inhibition (11, 42–45). COX-2 assays
following treatment with celecoxib have shown reduced activity
when the protein is inhibited with celecoxib, and there is this
compensatory increase in COX-2 protein levels (11). Therefore,

 the increase in protein expression has been used to indicate
effective inhibition of COX-2 activity and is a compensatory
response to inhibition (Fig. 6A; Supplementary Table S3; refs. 11,
42–45).
The drug combination significantly decreased the protein levels
of pSTAT3 (Y705) at the 24-hour time points (Fig. 6B) and that of
certain cyclins (Fig. 6C; Supplementary Table S3) in both UACC
903 and 1205 Lu cells. Results of the scanned and quantified
pSTAT3 levels that were normalized over STAT3 levels show that
for UACC 903 cells, there is a pSTAT3 range from 95 to 128 in
phosphorylation levels at 6 hours, which is likely just normal
variation with this type of analysis and suggests it is probably not
changing. At 24 hours, STAT3 phosphorylation levels are not
detectable for the drug combination, while the range is 89 to 54
for the control and single-agent treatments. Clearly, this change is
significant. Furthermore, the results for the 1205 Lu cell line
likewise show a similar trend at 6 hours and also show no
detectable STAT3 phosphorylation at 24 hours for the drug
combination compared with the individual drug controls. In
both melanoma cell lines, cyclins B1, D1, and H were coopera-
tively decreased after 24 hours of exposure to the drug combina-
tion. In addition to reductions of these cyclins in UACC 903 cells,
cyclin A2, E1, and E2 were also decreased in one but not both cell
lines. As cyclins are key to the functioning of the cyclin–cyclin
dependent kinase complex in melanoma cells, reductions in the
levels of these proteins, which were more prominent following
treatment with CelePlum-777 than with celecoxib or plumbagin
alone, could account for the reduction of cell proliferation seen in
cultured cells and in animal tumors. Increase in cleaved caspase-3
and PARP protein levels in cultured cells at late time points

 suggests that this phenomenon might be restricted to cells grow-
ing in these conditions and not to tumors in the in vivo environ-
ment (Fig. 6D). In addition, CelePlum-777 caused significant
cultured cell death, which consequently induced caspase-3/7
activity. Similar results were observed for protein lysates derived
from cultured UACC 903 and 1205 Lu cells treated with agent
alone or CelePlum-777 and analyzed for Apo-ONE homoge-
neous caspase-3/7 activity (Supplementary Fig. S8). This was not
observed in tumors (Figs. 5 and 6), suggesting it did not occur
in vivo but was a cell culture–only phenomenon.
Discussion
Malignant melanoma is an aggressive form of skin cancer due
to its high metastatic nature and drug resistance (46). Despite
the approval of V600E-BRAF inhibitors, Zelboraf (vemurafe-
nib), Tafinlar (dabrafenib), and an Mek inhibitor, Mekinist
(trametinib) by the FDA for treating patients with MAPK
signaling cascade activation (47), these targeted therapy
approaches are hindered by drug resistance eventually leading
to more aggressive disease development (48). Studies have
shown that resistance develops by compensatory reactivation
of MAPK signaling (49). Therefore, the development of novel
agents is needed to decrease the possibility of resistance devel-
opment, and one approach to accomplish this objective is to
develop single nanoparticle-based agents containing multiple
synergistically acting drugs (6, 50, 51).
Nanotechnology has the potential to delay drug resistance by
delivering multiple synergizing drugs to a tumor to kill the cells
more effectively than single agents (6, 7). Use of a single nano-
particle containing two synergizing drugs is an attractive thera-
peutic strategy because it has numerous merits over conventional
therapy, including being considered as a single drug product by
the FDA (6, 7, 50, 52). Combination pharmacologic agent ther-
apies can be limited because drugs can have different solubility,
bioavailability, and toxicity profiles, which creates complications
in dosing and scheduling optimization (53). This study details the
development of a nanoliposomal-based agent containing cele-
coxib and plumbagin, called CelePlum-777, which is stable and
releases these drugs at an optimal ratio for maximal synergistic
killing efficacy. Combining celecoxib with plumbagin in animals
or humans is not possible because of poor bioavailability, and
intravenous administration in DMSO is lethal, necessitating the
development of a clinically viable approach (54). Encapsulating
both agents at a synergistically killing drug ratio in a nanoparticle
resolved these issues, as both were solubilized in a single vehicle
that could be administered intravenously (40). The nanoparticle
loaded and delivered the two drugs at synergizing ratios to inhibit
tumor development at a significantly lower concentration than
required when using the single agents (52, 55). Furthermore, the
probability of developing recurrent resistant disease would be less
than if a single agent was used (52, 56). A final added advantage is
that a nanoparticle delivery system has the added potential of
extending the drug circulation half-life and promoting accumu-
lation in the tumor due to the enhanced permeability and reten-
tion effect (57).
Very little is known regarding the development and efficacy
of nanoparticles containing multiple drugs targeting key path-
ways important in melanoma development (52, 55). Typically,
lower concentrations of synergizing drugs are also needed for
efficacy, which occurred with CelePlum-777. Celecoxib induces
cultured cancer cells apoptosis at 25 to 100 mmol/L, which is
equivalent to 200 mg per day in animals, but this concentration
causes negative cardiovascular side effects (15, 16). Plumbagin
has toxic effects, making the use of low concentration impor-
tant (19). CelePlum-777 enabled the use of lower concentra-
tions of each agent, but retained efficacy due to the synergism
observed with the drug combination. CelePlum-777 had a
negligible killing effect on normal cells and did not cause
apparent systemic toxicity in mice.
CelePlum-777 synergistically inhibited xenografted melanoma
tumor development by targeting COX-2 and STAT3, which are
important pathways in melanoma development (8, 11, 24,
25, 58). These signaling pathways are constitutively activated in
the majority of melanomas, functioning to reduce cellular apo-
ptosis, increase proliferation, and aid the invasive processes to
promote melanoma metastasis development (8, 11, 24, 25, 58). It
is important to note that CelePlum-777 or the individual drugs
had negligible effects on proteins and pathways reported to be
regulated by these agents in other cancer types, including AKT,
NFkB, cPLA2, and COX-1 (8, 11, 24, 25, 58). These pathways were
not inhibited or involved in the synergistic inhibition mediated
by CelePlum-777. In contrast, modulating COX-2 and STAT3 led
to consistent decreases in cyclins that are key to the functioning of
the cyclin–cyclin dependent kinase complex in melanoma cells
(59). Cyclin D1, a regulatory protein transcriptionally activated by
the STAT3 signaling pathway, can promote cellular proliferation
and metastasis when overexpressed (60). Cyclin A2, cyclin B1, and
cyclin H are all factors that can drive cells through G2–M transition
(61–64), and decreased levels seem to contribute to the arrest of
cells in the G2–M phase of the cell cycle. Targeting multiple
pathways in this manner might more effectively treat cancer
without recurrent resistant cancer occurrence, making this a
significant development (24, 65–68).
In summary, CelePlum-777 is a nanoparticle containing cel-
ecoxib and plumbagin that functions synergistically to reduce
melanoma tumor growth with negligible systemic toxicity. It has a
unique mechanism of action by simultaneously targeting COX-2
and STAT3 pathways, leading to decreased levels of several key
cyclins important in melanoma development, which might more
effectively treat cancer without the development of recurrent
resistant disease (69).
