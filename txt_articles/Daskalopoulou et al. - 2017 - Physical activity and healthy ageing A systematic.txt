Background:
 Older  people
 constitute
 a  significant
 proportion
 of  the total
 population
 and  their  number
is
 projected
 to increase  by  more  than  half  by  2030.  This  increasing
 probability
 of  late  survival  comes
with
 considerable
 individual,
 economic
 and social
 impact.  Physical
 activity
 (PA)  can
 influence  the  ageing
process
 but  the  specific
 relationship
 with healthy
 ageing
 (HA)  is  unclear.
Methods:
 We  conducted
 a systematic
 review
 and  meta-analysis
 of longitudinal
 studies
 examining
 the
associations
 of  PA  with HA.  Studies
 were  identified
 from
 a  systematic
 search
 across
 major
 electronic
databases
 from  inception
 as  January  2017.  Random-effect
 meta-analysis
 was
 performed
 to calculate
 a
pooled
 effect
 size  (ES)  and  95%  CIs.  Studies
 were  assessed
 for methodological
 quality.
Results:
 Overall,
 23  studies
 were  identified
 including
 174,114  participants
 (30%  men) with age  ranges
from
 20  to 87  years  old.  There  was  considerable
 heterogeneity
 in  the  definition
 and  measurement
 of
HA
 and  PA.  Most  of
 the  identified
 studies  reported  a significant
 positive
 association
 of
 PA
 with  HA, six
reported
 a non-significant.
 Meta-analysis
 revealed
 that PA  is  positively
 associated
 with
 HA  (ES: 1.39,  95%
CI
 =  1.23–1.57,
 n
 =
 17)  even
 if  adjusted
 for  publication
 bias  (ES:  1.27,  95%  CI  =  1.11–1.45,  n  =
 20).
Conclusions:
 There  is
 consistent
 evidence
 from  longitudinal
 observational
 studies  that  PA  is
 positively
associated
 with
 HA,  regardless
 of  definition
 and measurement.
 Future
 research
 should  focus
 on
 the
implementation
 of
 a single
 metric
 of HA,  on  the  use  of  objective
 measures
 for  PA  assessment
 and
 on
 a
full-range
 of  confounding
 adjustment.
 In addition,
 our  research
 indicated  the  limited  research
 on ageing
in
 low-and-middle
 income
 countries.

 Introduction
Physical
 activity
 refers
 to
 any
 bodily
 movement
 that
 is
 produced
by
 the
 skeletal
 muscles
 and
 results
 in
 energy
 expenditure;
 whilst
exercise
 is
 a
 subset
 of
 physical
 activity
 since
 it
 is
 a
 planned,
 struc-
tured
 and
 repetitive
 process
 that
 aims
 to
 maintain
 and
 improve
physical
 fitness
 (Caspersen
 et
 al.,
 1985).
 There
 is
 a
 growing
 body
of
 interest
 that
 physical
 activity
 and
 exercise
 confer
 favourable
health
 outcomes
 across
 the
 lifespan.
 Based
 on
 a
 recent
 systematic
review
 of
 longitudinal
 cohorts,
 physical
 activity
 is
 associated
 with
a
 reduction
 in
 obesity,
 weight
 gain,
 coronary
 heart
 diseases
 (CHD),
type
 II
 diabetes
 mellitus
 and
 the
 age-related
 diseases
 of
 dementia
and
 Alzheimer’s
 disease
 (Reiner
 et
 al.,
 2013).
 In
 addition,
 physical
activity
 has
 been
 consistently
 linked
 to
 decreased
 all-cause
 mor-
tality
 rates,
 probability
 of
 late
 survival
 (Blair
 and
 Brodney,
 1999;
Benetos
 et
 al.,
 2005;
 Bembom
 et
 al.,
 2009),
 good
 health
 and
 func-
tion
 during
 older
 age
 (Yates
 et
 al.,
 2009)
 as
 well
 as
 to
 cognitive
performance
 (Newson
 and
 Kemps,
 2006).
 Conversely,
 sedentary
behaviour,
 defined
 as
 any
 waking
 behaviour
 characterised
 by
 an
energy
 expenditure
 less
 or
 equal
 than
 1.5
 metabolic
 equivalents
(METs)
 whilst
 in
 a
 sitting
 or
 reclining
 posture
 (Networ,
 2012),
 is
associated
 with
 an
 unfavourable
 biomarker
 profile
 in
 older
 age
(Wirth
 et
 al.,
 2016).
 Finally,
 a
 large
 meta-analysis
 indicated
 that
prolonged
 sedentary
 time
 is
 associated
 with
 all-cause
 mortality,
cardiovascular
 disease
 (CVD)
 incidence
 and
 mortality,
 type
 II
 dia-
betes
 incidence
 and
 cancer
 (Biswas
 et
 al.,
 2015).
Based
 on
 recent
 systematic
 reviews,
 exercise
 has
 been
 char-
acterised
 as
 an
 evidence-based
 treatment
 for
 depression
 (Schuch
et
 al.,
 2016)
 and
 as
 a
 resource
 of
 improvement
 of
 cognition,
 work-
ing
 memory
 and
 attention
 to
 detail
 for
 patients
 with
 schizophrenia
(Firth
 et
 al.,
 2016).
 A
 decreased
 risk
 of
 functional
 limitation
 and
 dis-
ability
 is
 also
 observed
 in
 older
 people
 who
 participate
 in
 regular
aerobic
 activities
 (Nusselder
 et
 al.,
 2008;
 Paterson
 and
 Warburton,
2010).
 Engaging
 in
 physical
 activities
 so
 as
 to
 promote
 and
 maintain
good
 health
 is
 recommended
 across
 the
 whole
 life-span
 (Haskell
et
 al.,
 2007;
 Janssen
 and
 LeBlanc,
 2010).
 Besides
 the
 amplified
evidence
 of
 the
 benefits
 of
 a
 physically
 active
 lifestyle,
 physical
inactivity,
 together
 with
 alcohol
 and
 exposure
 to
 tobacco
 smok-
ing,
 remain
 the
 major
 behavioural
 burdens
 worldwide,
 based
 on
findings
 from
 the
 Global
 Burden
 of
 Disease
 (IHME,
 2016).
Chronic
 non-communicable
 diseases
 figure
 amongst
 the
 pri-
mary
 contributors
 of
 the
 disease
 burden
 arising
 from
 behavioural
risk
 factors,
 and
 people
 60
 years
 old
 and
 over
 are
 accounted
 for
almost
 25%
 of
 it
 (Prince
 et
 al.,
 2015).
 Furthermore,
 the
 world
 is
 expe-
riencing
 a
 considerable
 increase
 in
 the
 older
 population,
 with
 more
than
 900
 million
 people
 aged
 60
 and
 over
 currently
 living
 world-
wide,
 and
 this
 number
 is
 projected
 to
 grow
 by
 56%
 between
 2015
and
 2030
 (United
 Nations,
 2015).
 Living
 longer
 does
 not
 necessarily
entail
 experiencing
 better
 health
 than
 previous
 generations
 (Beard
et
 al.,
 2016),
 as
 this
 demographic
 transition
 is
 associated
 with
 an
increase
 in
 chronic
 physical
 illnesses.
 CVD
 constitutes
 the
 leading
cause
 of
 death
 in
 the
 United
 States
 of
 America
 and
 is
 responsible
for
 almost
 one
 fifth
 of
 national
 health
 expenditures;
 these
 costs
are
 projected
 to
 increase
 by
 more
 than
 60%
 in
 2030
 (Heidenreich
et
 al.,
 2011).
 Globally,
 mortality
 rates
 due
 to
 communicable,
 mater-
nal
 neonatal
 and
 national
 diseases
 have
 declined,
 but
 in
 contrast
 the
disease
 burden
 has
 been
 shifted
 to
 non-communicable
 diseases
 and
this
 burden
 is
 likely
 to
 continue
 expanding
 (IHME,
 2016).
 This
 can
ultimately
 lead
 to
 higher
 health
 and
 social
 care
 costs.
 The
 rising
healthcare
 costs
 have
 led
 governments
 and
 societies
 to
 start
 devel-
oping
 policies
 for
 healthy
 ageing,
 aiming
 not
 only
 at
 prolonging
 the
duration
 of
 later
 life,
 but
 as
 well
 as
 to
 improving
 it
 (Hung
 et
 al.,
2010).
In
 the
 most
 recent
 World
 Health
 Organization
 ageing
 report,
healthy
 ageing
 was
 defined
 as
 the
 process
 of
 developing
 and
 main-
taining
 the
 functional
 ability
 that
 enables
 wellbeing
 in
 older
 age
(Beard
 et
 al.,
 2016).
 Even
 though
 there
 is
 a
 lack
 of
 consensus
 regard-
ing
 the
 definition
 of
 healthy
 ageing
 (Depp
 and
 Jeste,
 2006),
 the
scientific
 community
 have
 tried
 to
 identify
 those
 factors
 that
 will
allow
 individuals
 to
 age
 physically
 and
 mentally
 healthily.
 There
are
 several
 modifiable
 factors
 which
 could
 reduce
 premature
 death,
prevent
 morbidity
 and
 disability,
 and
 improve
 the
 quality
 of
 life
and
 well-being
 (Action
 plan
 for
 implementation
 of
 the
 European
strategy
 for
 the
 prevention
 and
 control
 of
 Noncommunicable
diseases,
 -,
 2012)
 and
 hence
 contribute
 to
 the
 increase
 of
 the
 like-
lihood
 of
 a
 healthy
 ageing.
 In
 addition,
 compression
 of
 morbidity
in
 later
 life
 could
 be
 achieved
 by
 successful
 interventions
 early
 in
life,
 as
 many
 disabilities
 are
 the
 result
 of
 a
 hazardous
 accumulated
lifestyle
 (Chatterji
 et
 al.,
 2015).
 In
 a
 review
 published
 over
 a
 decade
ago,
 physical
 activity,
 smoking
 and
 alcohol
 use
 were
 identified
 as
the
 most
 frequent
 behavioural
 determinants
 of
 healthy
 ageing
 (Peel
et
 al.,
 2005).
The
 aim
 of
 this
 systematic
 review
 and
 meta-analysis
 is
 to
 exam-
ine
 and
 synthesise
 the
 associations
 of
 physical
 activity
 and
 healthy
ageing
 in
 longitudinal
 cohorts
 of
 community
 based
 adults.
2.
 Methods
This
 systematic
 review
 was
 registered
 in
 the
 PROSPERO
 inter-
national
 database
 of
 prospectively
 registered
 systematic
 reviews
(protocol
 number:
 CRD42016038130)
 and
 written
 in
 accordance
with
 PRISMA
 and
 MOOSE
 statement
 for
 reporting
 systematic
reviews
 and
 meta-analyses
 (Shamseer
 et
 al.,
 2015;
 Stroup
 et
 al.,
2000).
 In
 the
 supplementary
 file
 we
 have
 attached
 a
 MOOSE
 check-
list.
 As
 part
 of
 a
 larger
 body
 of
 work
 considering
 modifiable
 lifestyle
factors
 and
 healthy
 ageing,
 we
 originally
 planned
 to
 carry
 out
 a
review
 focusing
 on:
 physical
 activity,
 smoking
 and
 alcohol
 con-
sumption.
 The
 current
 systematic
 review
 specifically
 focuses
 on
physical
 activity
 and
 healthy
 ageing
 outcome
 since
 a
 sufficient
amount
 of
 literature
 was
 identified
 on
 this
 topic
 alone.
2.1.

 were

activity,
 smoking
 and
 alcohol
 consumption.
 Details
 for
 the
 search-
ing
 technique
 are
 available
 in
 the
 Appendix
 A
 in
 Supplementary
material.
 Other
 relevant
 systematic
 reviews
 of
 healthy
 ageing
 and
reference
 lists
 of
 the
 eligible
 studies
 have
 also
 been
 searched.
Finally,
 a
 second
 search
 was
 performed
 in
 January
 2017
 so
 as
 to
include
 studies
 that
 were
 recently
 published.
An
 EndNote
 (ENDNOTE
 X7,
 Thomson
 Reuters)
 library
 was
 cre-
ated
 so
 as
 to
 store
 all
 the
 studies
 retrieved
 in
 the
 electronic
databases.
 Using
 EndNote’s
 auto-deduplication
 function,
 duplicate
citations
 were
 removed.
 Since
 auto-deduplication
 is
 thought
 to
 be
only
 partially
 successful
 (Qi
 et
 al.,
 2013),
 the
 remaining
 duplicates
were
 identified
 by
 hand-searching
 techniques.
 To
 do
 this,
 refer-
ences
 were
 alphabetically
 ordered
 according
 to
 the
 first
 authors’
names
 and
 thereafter
 according
 to
 their
 titles.
 The
 retrieved
 papers
were
 examined
 by
 two
 different
 reviewers
 (C.D.,
 C.K.)
 in
 two
 stages;
first
 the
 relevance
 of
 the
 study
 was
 judged
 by
 the
 title
 and
 the
abstract
 and
 if
 the
 eligibility
 of
 the
 study
 remained
 unclear,
 the
full
 text
 was
 read.
 At
 the
 end
 of
 this
 procedure,
 any
 disagreement
was
 solved
 by
 discussion
 between
 the
 two
 reviewers.
 In
 case
 that
an
 agreement
 could
 not
 be
 achieved,
 eligibility
 of
 the
 study
 was
judged
 by
 discussion
 with
 a
 third
 senior
 researcher
 (A.M.P.).
 In
 case
that
 full
 text
 could
 not
 be
 retrieved,
 the
 corresponding
 author
 of
 the
paper
 was
 contacted
 via
 e-mail.
2.2.
 Study
 inclusion
 &
 exclusion
Eligible
 studies
 had
 to
 fulfil
 the
 following
 criteria:
 i.
 be
 pub-
lished
 in
 an
 electronic
 journal
 article;
 ii.
 constitute
 an
 original
peer-reviewed
 longitudinal
 study;
 and
 iii.
 report
 any
 kind
 of
 longi-
tudinal
 association
 between
 physical
 activity
 and
 healthy
 ageing.
Regarding
 physical
 activity
 and
 exercise,
 both
 terms
 were
 included
in
 our
 research,
 since
 even
 if
 they
 describe
 different
 concepts,
 they
are
 often
 used
 as
 synonyms
 (Caspersen
 et
 al.,
 1985).
 However,
 for
the
 remainder
 of
 the
 manuscript,
 we
 will
 use
 the
 term
 physical
activity
 to
 encompass
 both
 concepts.
 To
 be
 considered
 an
 eligible
study,
 physical
 activity
 had
 to
 be
 measured
 either
 by
 self-reported
questionnaires
 and/or
 by
 more
 objective
 tools,
 such
 as
 accelerome-
ters
 or
 pedometers.
 The
 primary
 outcome
 of
 this
 review
 was
 health
status
 measured
 by
 healthy
 ageing,
 and
 any
 other
 term
 related
 to
 it
(e.g.
 successful
 ageing,
 active
 ageing,
 healthy
 survival
 etc.).
 Studies
whose
 primary
 goal
 was
 the
 examination
 of
 a
 different
 determi-
nant/factor
 but
 included
 the
 aforementioned
 factors
 as
 covariates
or
 as
 latent
 factors
 were
 also
 included.
 Due
 to
 the
 heterogeneity
 of
the
 healthy
 ageing
 definition,
 studies
 reporting
 the
 latter
 as
 multi-
ple
 outcomes
 or
 based
 solely
 on
 self-report
 were
 excluded.
 Studies
that
 included
 cohorts
 that
 were
 institutionalised
 or
 hospitalised,
and
 animal
 studies,
 were
 also
 excluded.
 No
 language
 restriction
was
 applied.
2.3.
 Data
 extraction
Data
 from
 each
 study
 were
 independently
 extracted
 by
 the
two
 reviewers
 C.D.
 and
 C.K.
 and
 a
 random
 sample
 of
 them
 was
cross-checked
 by
 A.M.P.
 Setting/country
 of
 the
 study,
 data
 collec-
tion
 period,
 follow-up
 year,
 sample
 size,
 population,
 and
 baseline
age
 information
 was
 recorded
 for
 each
 study.
 Definition
 and
 mea-
surement
 of
 the
 healthy
 ageing
 outcome
 and
 of
 physical
 activity
were
 also
 recorded,
 as
 well
 as
 the
 odds
 ratios
 (or
 any
 other
 related
statistic)
 and
 the
 95%
 confidence
 intervals
 (CI).
 Crude
 and
 the
 most
adjusted
 odds
 ratios
 (OR)
 were
 extracted.
2.4.
 Role
 of
 the
 funding
 source
This
 project
 falls
 under
 the
 ATHLOS
 (Ageing
 Trajectories
 of
Health:
 Longitudinal
 Opportunities
 and
 Synergies)
 project,
 funded
by
 the
 European
 Union’s
 Horizon
 2020
 Research
 and
 Innovation
Programme
 under
 grant
 agreement
 number
 635316.
 The
 sponsor
of
 the
 current
 systematic
 review
 had
 no
 participation
 in
 the
 study
design,
 data
 extraction,
 data
 interpretation,
 or
 writing
 of
 this
 paper.
2.5.
 Quality
 assessment
Quality
 assessment
 of
 the
 eligible
 studies
 was
 performed
 by
using
 the
 Quality
 in
 Prognosis
 Studies
 (QUIPS)
 tool.
 QUIPS
 evaluates
six
 potential
 components
 of
 bias:
 inclusion,
 attrition,
 prognos-
tic
 factor
 measurement,
 confounders,
 outcome
 measurement,
 and
analysis
 and
 reporting,
 (Hayden
 et
 al.,
 2013).
 During
 the
 applica-
tion
 of
 the
 QUIPS
 tool,
 the
 following
 alterations
 were
 done:
 physical
activity
 was
 considered
 as
 the
 only
 prognostic
 factor
 and
 all
 other
variables,
 used
 as
 explanatory
 variables
 of
 the
 model,
 were
 con-
sidered
 as
 confounders.
 Exception
 to
 this
 rule
 were
 studies
 that
explicitly
 stated,
 even
 in
 their
 title,
 that
 the
 association
 of
 some
other
 factor
 with
 healthy
 ageing
 was
 examined.
 In
 this
 case,
 the
specific
 factor
 together
 with
 physical
 activity
 were
 evaluated
 as
prognostic
 factors.
 Moreover,
 since
 only
 longitudinal
 studies
 were
considered,
 attrition
 was
 expected.
 Where
 the
 attrition
 rate
 was
high,
 authors’
 explanations
 were
 sought
 so
 as
 to
 evaluate
 the
 risk
 of
bias
 within
 these
 studies.
 Finally,
 the
 reliability
 of
 statistical
 mod-
els
 was
 evaluated
 according
 to
 the
 data
 presented;
 for
 example
papers
 that
 included
 results
 solely
 for
 the
 statistical
 significant
 fac-
tors
 were
 judged
 with
 caution.
 (Implementation
 of
 QUIPS
 tool
 is
provided
 in
 the
 Appendix
 B
 in
 Supplementary
 material).
2.6.
 Statistical
 analysis
In
 the
 meta-analysis
 we
 aimed
 to:
 i)
 establish
 the
 effects
 of
 phys-
ical
 activity
 on
 healthy
 ageing
 and
 extract
 a
 pooled
 effect
 size
 (ES)
estimate
 by
 comparing
 participants
 who
 belonged
 to
 the
 highest
versus
 the
 lowest
 reported
 physical
 activity
 group,
 (e.g.
 high
 vs
non-exerciser
 (Burke
 et
 al.,
 2001),
 vigorous
 vs
 low
 (Gureje
 et
 al.,
2014),
 active
 vs
 inactive
 (Hodge
 et
 al.,
 2013b)),
 ii)
 investigate,
 via
sensitivity
 and
 subgroup
 analyses,
 the
 magnitude
 of
 the
 effects
 for
the
 association
 between
 physical
 activity
 and
 healthy
 ageing,
 con-
sidering
 the
 following:
 study
 quality,
 baseline
 mean
 age,
 follow-up
time,
 areas
 of
 information
 used
 for
 the
 definition
 of
 healthy
 age-
ing,
 measurement
 of
 physical
 activity
 or
 exercise
 and
 definition
 of
physical
 activity,
 iii)
 identify
 any
 potential
 modifiers
 through
 meta-
regression
 analyses
 and
 iv)
 assess
 the
 influence
 of
 publication
 bias
on
 the
 reported
 effects.
Due
 to
 the
 expected
 heterogeneity,
 random
 effects
 meta-
analysis
 using
 the
 DerSimonian-Laird
 model
 was
 performed
(DerSimonian
 and
 Laird,
 1986).
 Among
 the
 considered
 studies,
 the
following
 measures
 of
 association
 between
 healthy
 ageing
 and
physical
 activity
 were
 found:
 OR,
 Risk
 Ratios
 (RR)
 (one
 study),
 Haz-
ard
 Ratios
 (HR)
 (one
 study)
 and
 Proportion
 of
 Healthy/Successful
Years
 (HY)
 (two
 studies)
 and
 their
 95%
 CIs.
 Our
 pooled
 ES
 estimate
is
 given
 by
 taking
 into
 account
 only
 studies
 reporting
 ORs,
 however
we
 also
 calculated
 a
 pooled
 ES
 estimate
 for
 all
 reported
 statistics,
by
 considering
 HR
 and
 RR
 as
 similar,
 to
 test
 the
 robustness
 of
 our
estimate.
 All
 studies
 were
 included
 in
 the
 meta-analyses
 except
one
 that
 reported
 the
 �
 coefficient
 of
 linear
 regression
 analysis
(Palmore,
 1979),
 one
 that
 did
 not
 report
 non
 statistically
 signifi-
cant
 results
 (Terry
 et
 al.,
 2005),
 and
 one
 that
 provided
 �
 coefficient
of
 a
 linear
 mixed
 model
 (Tampubolon,
 2016).
Firstly,
 we  computed
 a
 meta-analysis
 by
 considering
 all
 the
studies
 reporting
 ORs
 and
 by
 including
 the
 results
 of
 the
 most
adjusted
 model.
 If
 a
 study
 reported
 different
 results
 per
 men
 and
women
 both
 results
 were
 included,
 except
 in
 cases
 (e.g.
 Gureje
et
 al.,
 2014)
 where
 a
 result
 for
 the
 mixed
 population
 was
 also
provided.
 We  subsequently
 conducted
 sensitivity
 analyses
 by
 com-
puting
 the
 effect
 of
 physical
 activity
 on
 healthy
 ageing
 in
 studies
with
 low
 risk
 of
 bias
 and
 by
 considering
 the
 results
 of
 the

justed
 models
 (when
 these
 were
 available).
 To
 understand
 part
 of
the
 observed
 heterogeneity
 we
 also
 performed
 subgroup
 analyses.
Subgroup
 analyses
 were
 performed
 by
 creating
 the
 following
 indi-
cator
 variables:
 (i)
 biomedical
 model;
 this
 variable
 indicated
 if
 the
following
 areas
 of
 information
 were
 included
 in
 the
 definition
 of
healthy
 ageing:
 physical
 performance,
 diseases
 and
 mental
 health
status,
 (ii)
 physical
 activity
 binary;
 this
 variable
 indicated
 if
 phys-
ical
 activity
 was
 measured
 as
 a
 binary
 variable
 (physical
 active
 or
inactive)
 or
 more
 levels
 of
 physical
 activity
 were

 sources.
 After

of
 papers
 that
 were
 abstracts,

 or

 73
 were

42

 23
 were
 included
in
 the

 of
 this
 report.
 In
 Fig.
 1,
 the
 PRISMA

 chart
depicts
 the
 exact
 process.
 Across
 the
 23
 eligible
 studies,
 there
 were
174,114
 participants
 (almost
 30%
 men),
 with
 sample
 size
 ranging
from
 155
 to
 68,153.
 Ten
 studies
 took
 place
 in
 USA,
 four
 in
 Australia
and
 England,
 two
 in
 China
 and
 in
 Canada,
 and
 one
 study
 took
 place
in
 Nigeria.
 Baseline
 mean
 age
 ranges
 from
 20
 to
 87
 years
 old
 and
follow-up
 time
 from
 two
 years
 until
 death
 (>60
 years
 old).
 Only
five
 out
 of
 the
 23
 focused
 solely
 on
 sub-groups
 of
 men
 or
 women.

 of
 the
 included
 studies
 are
 presented
 in
 Table

Healthy
 ageing,
 and
 any
 other
 term
 used
 as
 a
 synonym,
 was
defined
 by
 including
 various
 areas
 of
 information
 to
 each
 study.
These
 were
 grouped
 in
 the
 following
 categories:
 survival
 to
 a
 spe-
cific
 age
 or
 during
 follow-up,
 health
 status
 (either
 self-reported
or
 measured
 by
 specific
 questionnaires),
 physical
 performance
(including
 information
 regarding
 mobility,
 disabilities
 and/or
 diffi-
culties
 in
 activities
 of
 daily
 living
 (ADL)
 and
 instrumental
 activities
of
 daily
 living
 (iADL)),
 diseases
 (including
 chronic
 diseases
 and
cancer),
 mental
 health
 and
 cognition
 status,
 subjective
 measure-
ments
 of
 the
 participants
 (life
 satisfaction,
 happiness,
 and
 pain)
 and
other
 (anthropometric
 measurements,
 personal
 assistance,
 social
support).
 Most
 of
 the
 studies
 (19
 out
 of
 23)
 included
 physical
 per-
formance
 to
 define
 healthy
 ageing
 and
 more
 than
 half
 of
 them
(13
 out
 of
 23)
 included
 information
 regarding
 diseases
 and
 mental
health.
 Survival
 to
 a
 specific
 age
 was
 also
 an
 area
 often
 found
 in
 the
definition
 of
 healthy
 ageing,
 whereas
 health
 status
 and
 subjective
measurements
 were
 not
 so
 often
 included.
 (Appendix
 D
 in
 Sup-
plementary
 material
 presents
 the
 areas
 of
 information
 that
 were
present
 in
 the
 definition
 of
 healthy
 ageing
 per
 study)
 (Fig.
 2).
Almeida
 et
 al.,
 (2013)
 reported
 that
 engaging
 in
 a
 physically
active
 lifestyle
 increases
 the
 likelihood
 of
 men
 aged
 65–83
 years
to
 remain
 alive
 and
 free
 of
 functional
 or
 mental
 impairments
 after
10–13
 years
 of
 follow
 up
 by
 1.6-fold.
 Results
 of
 the
 same
 direction
were
 also
 reported
 by
 Andrews
 et
 al.
 (2002),
 Burke
 et
 al.
 (2001)
and
 Britton
 et
 al.
 (2008).
 The
 latter
 reported
 that
 the
 odds
 of
 healthy
ageing
 for
 men
 and
 women,
 who
 engage
 in
 vigorous
 physical
 activ-
ity
 during
 midlife,
 were
 double
 compared
 to
 those
 that
 do
 none
 or
mild
 exercise.
 Gu
 et
 al.
 (2009)
 revealed
 that
 elders
 who
 do
 regular
exercise
 could
 improve
 the
 odds
 of
 healthy
 survival
 by
 30%
 than
those
 who
 do
 not,
 whereas
 Hamer
 et
 al.
 (2013)
 by
 using
 data
 from
the
 English
 Longitudinal
 Study
 of
 Ageing
 (ELSA)
 found
 that
 people
that
 did
 moderate
 or
 vigorous
 activity
 were
 3.1-fold
 and
 4.3-fold
more
 likely
 to
 be
 healthy
 agers.
 Increased
 odds
 of
 healthy
 ageing
were
 also
 reported
 to
 Hodge
 et
 al.
 (2013a),
 to
 Hodge
 et
 al.
 (2013b)
and
 to
 LaCroix
 et
 al.
 (2016).
 The
 only
 non-English
 study
 was
 that
 of
Li
 et
 al.
 (2001)
 where
 regular
 exercise
 was
 also
 related
 to
 increased
odds
 of
 successful
 ageing.
 Newman
 et
 al.
 (2003),
 Palmore
 (1979),
Sabia
 et
 al.
 (2012),
 Shields
 and
 Martel
 (2016),
 Vaillant
 and
 Mukamal
(2001),
 and
 Sun
 et
 al.
 (2010)
 also
 reported
 a
 positive
 association
between
 physical
 activity
 and
 the
 odds
 of
 successful
 survival.
 Par-
ticipants
 with
 higher
 levels
 of
 physical
 activity
 also
 reported
 higher
levels
 of
 healthy
 ageing
 phenotype
 (Tampubolon
 et

 Meta-analysis
3.3.1.
 Main
 results
Data
 pooled
 from
 the
 studies
 showed
 a
 significant
 positive
 asso-
ciation
 between
 physical
 activity
 and
 healthy
 ageing
 (ES
 =
 1.39,
 95%
CI
 1.23-1.57,
 p
 <
 0.001,
 Q
 =
 84.73,
 I2 =

 p
 <

 Our

 to

 p
 =

 did
 not
 provide
 evidence
 for
 publication
 bias.
 How-
ever,
 we  still
 adjusted
 our
 pooled
 estimate
 with
 the
 trim-and-fill
algorithm
 and
 the
 association
 remained
 positive
 and
 significant
 as
decided
 a
 priori
 (ES(filled

 =

 95%
 CI
 1.11-1.45,

3.3.2.
 Sensitivity
 and
 subgroup
 analysis
Sensitivity
 and
 subgroup
 analyses
 were
 all
 adjusted
 for
 pub-
lication
 bias
 by
 using
 the
 trim-and-fill
 algorithm;
 the
 effect
 of
physical
 activity
 on
 healthy
 ageing
 was
 slightly
 overestimated
 in
most
 of
 them.
 However,
 the
 significant
 positive
 association
 of
 phys-
ical
 activity
 on
 healthy
 ageing
 remained
 after
 adjustment
 in
 the
majority
 of
 analyses
 (Table
 3).
 The
 pooled
 ES
 estimate
 increased
when
 we  took
 into
 account
 only
 studies
 with
 low
 risk
 of
 bias
 (1.43
vs
 1.39)
 and
 when
 we  considered
 the
 least
 adjusted
 models
 (1.51
 vs
1.39)
 but
 it
 did
 not
 vary
 when
 we  considered
 all
 the
 reported
 statis-
tics
 (1.38
 vs
 1.39).
 The
 odds
 of
 healthy
 ageing
 for
 people
 engaging
 in
physical
 activity
 were
 higher
 when
 studies
 included
 information
 on
physical
 performance,
 diseases
 and
 mental
 status
 in
 their
 definition
of
 healthy
 ageing
 (1.61
 vs
 1.14)
 and
 in
 those
 where
 physical
 activity
was
 not
 recorded
 as
 a
 binary
 variable
 (1.68
 vs
 1.26).
 Younger
 par-
ticipants
 exhibited
 higher
 pooled
 ES
 than
 older
 participants
 (1.64
vs
 1.14)
 whereas
 no
 difference
 was
 revealed
 among
 studies
 which
had
 follow-up
 time
 more
 than
 10
 years
 and
 those
 with
 equal
 or
less
 than
 10
 years
 (1.37
 vs
 1.39).
 Studies
 that
 measured
 exercise
reported
 a
 lower
 pooled
 ES
 compared
 to
 studies
 that
 measured
physical
 activity
 (1.20
 vs
 1.46).
 However,
 this
 finding
 did
 not
 hold
when
 we  also
 took
 into
 account
 the
 follow-up
 time.
 More
 specifi-
cally,
 when
 examining
 studies
 with
 follow-up
 of
 more
 than
 10
 years
the
 pooled
 ES
 of
 studies
 measuring
 exercise
 was
 1.88
 (95%CI:
 1.39-
2.55)
 whereas
 the
 pooled
 ES
 of
 studies
 measuring
 physical
 activity
was
 1.33
 (95%CI:
 1.19-1.47)
 (results
 are
 provided
 upon
 request).
3.3.3.
 Meta-regression
In
 order
 to
 understand
 the
 relatively
 high
 heterogeneity,
 meta-
regression
 analyses
 were
 performed
 on
 the
 natural
 logarithm
 of
 the
ES.
 Baseline
 mean
 age
 and
 the
 variable
 indicating
 the
 areas
 of
 infor-
mation
 in
 the
 definition
 of
 healthy
 ageing
 emerged
 as
 significant
modifiers.
 Studies
 with
 lower
 baseline
 mean
 age
 and
 studies
 that
defined
 healthy
 ageing
 with
 a
 biomedical
 model
 produced
 higher
positive
 impact.
 The
 variable
 indicating
 if
 studies
 measured
 phys-
ical
 activity
 or
 exercise
 was
 not
 statistically
 significant.
 Follow-up
time
 was
 also
 not

 Discussion
To
 our
 knowledge,
 this
 systematic
 review
 is
 the
 first
 to
 examine
the
 association
 between
 physical
 activity
 and
 healthy
 ageing,
 by
performing
 a
 meta-analysis
 so
 as
 to
 produce
 a
 pooled
 effect
 esti-
mate
 and
 adjusting
 for
 publication
 bias.
 Our
 study
 highlights
 the
positive
 impact
 of
 physical
 activity
 on
 the
 healthy
 ageing
 process.
More
 specifically,
 our
 data
 suggest
 that
 in
 the
 majority
 of
 studies,
when
 participants
 engaged
 in
 physical
 activity
 their
 odds
 of
 living
a
 healthy
 life
 in
 an
 older
 age
 were
 increased
 compared
 to
 partici-
pants
 that
 were
 physically
 less
 active
 or
 inactive
 (Table
 2).
 From
 our
review
 it
 also
 becomes
 evident
 that
 the
 majority
 of
 the
 studies
 have
been
 implemented
 in
 high-income
 countries.
 Thus,
 in
 accordance
with
 a
 previous
 study
 (Chatterji,
 2015),
 the
 current
 investigation
ascertains
 the
 present
 limited
 research
 on
 ageing
 in
 low
 and
 middle
income
 countries
 (LMICs).
 Nevertheless,
 estimations
 have
 shown
that
 the
 population
 growth
 in
 developing
 countries
 will
 be
 more
rapid
 than
 the
 one
 experienced
 by
 developed
 countries
 and
 that
 by
2050
 80%
 of
 the
 people
 aged
 60
 years
 and
 over
 will
 live
 in
 a
 LMIC
(WHO,
 2016).
Furthermore,
 we
 tried
 to
 synthesise
 our
 results
 by
 produc-
ing
 a
 pooled
 effect
 estimate
 despite
 the
 quite
 high
 heterogeneity
(I2 =
 81.1%).
 However,
 rarely
 are
 studies
 identical
 replications
 of
one
 another,
 so
 including
 studies
 that
 are
 diverse
 in
 methodol-
ogy,
 measures,
 and
 sample
 within
 our
 meta-analysis
 exhibits
 the
advantage
 of
 improving
 the
 generalisability
 of
 our
 conclusions
(Rosenthal
 and
 DiMatteo,
 2001).
 MOOSE
 guidelines
 also
 recom-
mend
 the
 investigation
 of
 high
 heterogeneity
 by
 subgroup
 and
meta-regression
 analysis
 (Stroup
 et
 al.,
 2000).
 The
 pooled
 esti-
mate
 was
 1.39
 (95%CI:
 1.23–1.57)
 and
 the
 positive
 association
held
 even
 when
 its
 robustness
 was
 tested
 by
 performing
 sensitiv-
ity
 and
 subgroup
 analyses.
 From
 statistical
 tests
 (Begg-Mazumdar
Kendall’s
 Tau
 and
 Egger
 Bias
 test),
 graphical
 examination
 (funnel
plot-Appendix
 E
 in
 Supplementary
 material)
 and
 the
 application
 of
the
 trim-and-fill
 algorithm
 we
 conclude
 that
 our
 data
 did
 not
 show
significant
 evidence
 for
 publication
 bias.
Nevertheless,
 by
 performing
 subgroup
 analyses,
 we  found
 that
the
 different
 metrics
 of
 physical
 activity
 influenced
 the
 final
 out-
come.
 More
 specifically,
 when
 physical
 activity
 was
 defined
 as
 a
binary
 variable
 (i.e.
 such
 an
 approach
 would
 not
 take
 into
 account
the
 level
 or
 intensity
 of
 the
 activity),
 the
 associations
 were
 smaller
compared
 to
 studies
 in
 which
 different
 levels
 of
 activity
 were
 taken
into
 account.
 However,
 this
 finding
 could
 have
 been
 influenced
 by
the
 studies
 comparing
 high
 levels
 of
 physical
 activity
 to
 lower
 levels
(i.e.
 vigorous
 vs
 low
 in
 Gureje
 et
 al.
 (2014)).
 In
 addition,
 our
 review
revealed
 a
 misconception
 regarding
 the
 classification
 of
 the
 terms
physical
 activity
 and
 exercise.
 We  tried
 to
 categorise
 our
 studies,
so
 as
 to
 explain
 more
 of
 the
 underlying
 heterogeneity
 however,
 it
was
 not
 always
 easy
 to
 understand
 what
 actually
 had
 been
 mea-
sured
 in
 the
 individual
 considered
 studies.
 A
 higher
 association
was
 observed
 between
 healthy
 ageing
 and
 studies
 measuring
 PA
than
 studies
 measuring
 exercise,
 but
 the
 opposite
 result
 was
 indi-
cated
 when
 only
 studies
 of
 more
 than
 10
 year
 follow-up
 time
 were
considered.
 When
 adjusting
 the
 physical
 activity
 related
 subgroup
analyses
 with
 the
 trim-and-fill
 algorithm,
 associations
 remained
positive
 but
 not
 statistically
 significant
 in
 a
 95%
 CI.
 Our
 review
indicated
 that
 future
 studies
 should
 exhibit
 a
 more
 straightforward
definition
 and
 measurement
 of
 physical
 activity.
Differences
 were
 also
 identified
 when
 we
 examined
 studies
based
 on
 the
 areas
 of
 information
 included
 in
 the
 definition
 of
healthy
 ageing.
 Studies
 that
 defined
 the
 latter
 by
 including
 informa-
tion
 on
 physical
 performance,
 diseases
 and
 mental
 status
 present
increased
 OR
 for
 physically
 active
 participants.
 Based
 on
 a
 system-
atic
 review
 of
 healthy
 ageing,
 to
 date
 there
 is
 neither
 a
 unanimous
definition
 nor
 a
 standardised
 metric
 of
 it;
 in
 addition,
 there
 is
not
 an
 agreed
 term
 to
 use,
 with
 ‘healthy
 ageing’,
 ‘successful
 age-
ing’,
 ‘productive
 ageing’
 or/and
 ‘optimal
 ageing’
 all
 being
 used
 as
synonyms
 (Depp
 and
 Jeste,
 2006).
 Our
 review
 also
 confirms
 the
lack
 of
 consensus
 metric
 and
 of
 a
 unanimous
 term.
 Healthy
 age-
ing,
 successful
 ageing,
 healthy
 years,
 healthy
 survivors,
 healthy
survival,
 overall
 good
 health,
 exceptional
 survival,
 positive
 age-
ing,
 relatively
 healthy,
 thrivers
 were
 the
 terms
 that
 we
 found
 in
our
 studies.
 Hence,
 it
 is
 highly
 recommended
 that
 future
 research
should
 focus
 on
 a
 more
 standardised
 approach
 for
 the
 definition
and
 the
 measurement
 of
 the
 healthy
 ageing
 outcome
 so
 as
 to
 facil-
itate
 comparisons
 among
 populations.
From
 our
 meta-regression
 analysis,
 we
 showed
 that
 baseline
age
 and
 the
 definition
 of
 the
 metric
 of
 healthy
 ageing
 are
 signifi-
cant
 modifiers.
 Physical
 activity
 definition
 was
 significant
 at
 a
 10%
level
 of
 significance
 (Table
 4).
 Younger
 cohorts
 who
 engage
 in
 some
form
 of
 physical
 activity
 were
 more
 likely
 to
 have
 a
 healthier
 life
as
 they
 grow
 older.
 In
 addition,
 the
 areas
 of
 information
 included
in
 the
 definition
 of
 healthy
 ageing
 influenced
 the
 final
 outcome.
This
 finding
 comes
 in
 accordance
 with
 the
 comment
 of
 Phelan
 and
Larson
 (2002)
 that
 predictors
 of
 successful
 ageing
 are
 influenced
by
 the
 way
 the
 latter
 has
 been
 defined.
 We  found
 a
 distinction
between
 the
 biomedical
 models,
 which
 emphasise
 the
 absence
of
 disease
 in
 parallel
 with
 good
 physical
 and
 mental
 functioning
and
 the
 non-biomedical
 models.
 In
 the
 non-biomedical
 subgroup,
socio-psychological
 models
 were
 also
 included
 which
 emphasise
life
 satisfaction,
 social
 functioning
 and
 participation
 (Bowling
 and
Dieppe,
 2005).
 From
 our
 meta-regression
 we
 concluded
 that
 the
biomedical
 models
 are
 more
 strongly
 associated
 with
 physical
activity.
The
 precise
 mechanisms
 by
 which
 physical
 activity
 may
 pro-
mote
 healthy
 ageing
 are
 yet
 to
 be
 determined.
 However,
 this
 could
be
 attributed
 in
 part
 to
 the
 favourable
 biomarkers
 profiles
 from
physical
 activity
 such
 as
 reducing
 fat
 mass
 and
 adipose
 tissue
inflammation
 (Woods
 et
 al.,
 2012).
 Furthermore,
 physical
 activity
and
 exercise
 are
 known
 to
 prevent
 and
 reduce
 functional
 indepen-
dence
 (Tak
 et
 al.,
 2013)
 as
 well
 as
 confer
 a
 protective
 influence
 on
multiple
 non-communicable
 diseases.
 The
 latter
 may
 account
 for
the
 positive
 impact
 of
 physical
 activity
 on
 healthy
 ageing.
4.1.
 Strengths
 and
 limitations
The
 fact
 that
 this
 study
 has
 been
 done
 by
 independently
 double
screening
 the
 initial
 results,
 taking
 into
 account
 previous
 system-
 16
 
C.
 Daskalopoulou
 et

 /
 Ageing
 Research
 Reviews
 38
 (2017)
 6–17
atic
 reviews
 in
 the
 field
 and
 the
 reference
 lists
 of
 the
 eligible
 papers
allows
 a
 great
 amount
 of
 confidence
 that
 all
 relevant
 studies
 were
included.
 Regarding
 the
 quality
 assessment
 of
 the
 studies,
 limited
disagreement
 (less
 than
 8%)
 among
 the
 six
 different
 domains
 per
study
 was
 reached
 between
 the
 two
 reviewers,
 who
 independently
assessed
 them,
 concluding
 that
 the
 QA
 tool
 was
 highly
 straightfor-
ward
 and
 did
 not
 allow
 great
 amount
 of
 misjudgement.
 Attrition
rate
 and
 missing
 confounders
 in
 the
 final
 models
 were
 important
factors
 for
 the
 quality
 of
 the
 studies;
 hence
 future
 studies
 should
consider
 these
 important
 issues
 more
 thoroughly.
Nevertheless,
 the
 following
 limitations
 have
 to
 be
 taken
 into
account.
 Each
 study
 was
 adjusted
 by
 using
 a
 different
 set
 of
 covari-
ates,
 different
 follow-up
 time
 and
 attrition
 rate
 and
 all
 these
 could
have
 contributed
 to
 the
 high
 heterogeneity
 observed
 in
 the
 meta-
analysis
 and
 to
 the
 conclusions
 of
 our
 review.
 In
 addition,
 in
 all
studies
 physical
 activity
 was
 measured
 by
 using
 self-reported
 ques-
tionnaires,
 which
 means
 that
 results
 were
 subject
 to
 potential
 bias.
The
 use
 of
 more
 objective
 tools,
 such
 as
 an
 accelerometer,
 is
 highly
recommended
 since
 self-reporting
 is
 also
 prone
 to
 recall
 bias
 with
poor
 reliability
 and
 validity
 (Falck
 et
 al.,
 2015).
 There
 is
 also
 lack
of
 consistency
 regarding
 the
 way
 frequency,
 intensity
 and
 duration
of
 physical
 activity
 were
 reported.
 Similar
 problems
 are
 also
 men-
tioned
 in
 other
 systematic
 reviews
 of
 physical
 activity
 (Hamer
 and
Chida,
 2008),
 (Reiner
 et
 al.,
 2013).
 Furthermore,
 self-reported
 phys-
ical
 activity
 allows
 us
 to
 consider
 physical
 activity
 only
 during
 the
time
 of
 examination
 whereas
 the
 monitoring
 of
 the
 physical
 activ-
ity
 level
 between
 questionnaire
 administrations
 and
 outcome
 is
 not
measured.
 In
 this
 way
 we
 are
 not
 able
 to
 assess
 the
 impact
 of
 a
 con-
tinuous
 physical
 active
 lifestyle
 on
 healthy
 ageing.
 Finally,
 there
 is
an
 ambiguity
 regarding
 the
 concepts
 that
 have
 actually
 been
 mea-
sured;
 physical
 activity
 or
 exercise.
 Hence,
 future
 research
 should
focus
 on
 a
 more
 accurate
 definition
 and
 measurement
 of
 physical
activity
 as
 well
 as
 the
 optimal
 dose
 of
 it
 for
 succeeding
 a
 healthy
ageing.
4.2.
 Conclusion
In
 conclusion,
 engaging
 in
 physical
 activity
 increases
 the
 odds
of
 maintaining
 our
 well-being
 in
 later
 life.
 This
 result
 is
 identi-
fied
 in
 both
 the
 majority
 of
 our
 primary
 studies
 and
 in
 our
 pooled
effect
 estimate
 as
 well.
 Since
 our
 studies
 are
 all
 observational
 ones,
a
 causal
 relationship
 between
 physical
 activity
 and
 healthy
 age-
ing
 should
 be
 argued
 with
 caution.
 From
 our
 research
 it
 becomes
evident
 that
 there
 is
 an
 undisputable
 need
 to
 implement
 unani-
mous
 definitions
 and
 metrics
 of
 healthy
 ageing
 and
 physical
 activity
across
 studies
 so
 as
 to
 ultimately
 make
 them
 comparable
 among
different
 cohorts
 and
 waves.
 Implementation
 of
 a
 healthy
 ageing
metric
 and
 more
 research
 in
 LMICs
 will
 also
 allow
 us
 to
 test
 mea-
surement
 invariance
 hypotheses
 among
 different
 cultural
 settings,
once
 these
 will
 be
 available.
 In
 addition,
 it
 will
 enable
 us
 to
 robustly
estimate
 the
 point
 when
 a
 change
 in
 the
 ageing
 process
 occurs
and
 to
 investigate
 which
 determinants
 trigger
 that
 change.
 ATH-
LOS
 project
 (http://athlosproject.eu/)
 aims
 to
 fill
 this
 knowledge
gap
 by
 creating
 a
 harmonised
 dataset
 among
 different
 longitudinal
cohorts,
 defining
 a
 unanimous
 healthy
 ageing
 index
 and
 common
metrics
 of
 its
 determinants.
