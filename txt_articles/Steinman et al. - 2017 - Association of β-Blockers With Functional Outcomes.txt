Abstract
Importance—Beta blockers are a mainstay of treatment after acute myocardial infarction (AMI). 
Yet, these medications are commonly not prescribed for older nursing home residents after AMI, 
in part owing to concerns about potential functional harms and uncertainty of benefit.

 Objective—We studied the impact of beta blockers after AMI on functional decline, mortality, 
and rehospitalization among long-stay nursing home residents age 65 and older.
Design, setting, participants, exposure—Observational study of nursing home residents 
with AMI in 2007–2010, using national data from the Minimum Data Set and Medicare Parts A 
and D. Subjects with beta blocker use prior to AMI were excluded. We used propensity score-
based methods to compare outcomes in people who did vs. did not initiate a beta blocker after 
AMI hospitalization.
Main outcomes—Functional decline, death, and rehospitalization in the first 90 days after AMI. 
Functional status was measured using a validated 28-point scale that evaluates independence in 
activities of daily living.
Results—The study cohort included 5,496 new beta blocker users and an equal number of non-
users. Mean age was 84 years. Beta blocker users were more likely than non-users to experience 
functional decline (OR 1.14, 95% CI 1.02–1.28), with a number need to harm of 52. Conversely, 
beta blocker users were less likely than non-users to die (HR 0.74, 95% CI 0.67–0.83) and had 
similar rates of re-hospitalization (HR 1.06, 95% CI 0.98–1.14). Nursing home residents with 
moderate or severe cognitive impairment or severe functional dependency were particularly likely 
to experience functional decline from beta blockers (OR 1.34, 95% CI 1.11–1.61 and OR 1.32, 
95% CI 1.10–1.59, respectively). In contrast, there was little evidence of functional decline from 
beta blockers in subjects with better cognitive and functional status (ORs 0.99 to 1.05; P value for 
effect modification 0.03 and 0.06, respectively). Mortality benefits of beta blockers were similar 
across all subgroups.
Conclusions/relevance—Use of beta blockers after AMI is associated with functional decline 
in older nursing home residents with substantial cognitive or functional impairment, but not in 
those with relatively preserved mental and functional abilities. Beta blockers yielded considerable 
mortality benefit in all groups.
Beta blockers are a mainstay of guideline-recommended care for adults following acute 
myocardial infarction (AMI).1,2 Randomized trials in middle-aged and “young-old” adults 
show that treatment with beta blockers after AMI reduces mortality by 25–30%.3–5 Multiple 
observational studies have found a similar level of mortality reduction in adults 85 years and 
older and in those with functional impairment.6–9
Despite the benefits of beta blockers across the age span, these medications are less often 
prescribed to older adults, especially those with functional impairment or 
multimorbidity.6,7,10,11 Although studies have suggested that beta blockers are generally 
well-tolerated in older adults,12–14 there are little data on their adverse event profile in frail 
and highly vulnerable elders, including potential harms such as orthostasis, fatigue, and 
depression, which can negatively impact daily functioning and quality of life. This dilemma, 
where potential mortality benefits are weighed against an unclear level of harms, is common 
in the care of vulnerable older adults.15–18 It is particularly important for the 1.4 million 
Americans who reside in nursing homes, who are at high risk of functional decline and often 
strongly value preserving whatever remaining functional independence they have.19,20

 In this study, we evaluated the impact of beta blockers on functional outcomes in older 
nursing home residents with myocardial infarction, and compared these functional outcomes 
with the impact of beta blockers on death and re-hospitalization in this population.
Methods
Data Sources and Subjects
Data came from Medicare Part A and Part D (prescription drug benefit) claims; the Online 
Survey Certification and Reporting System (OSCAR), which provides facility-level 
information on nursing home characteristics, staffing, and quality indicators; and the 
Minimum Data Set (MDS) version 2.0, which comprises assessments made on nearly all 
nursing home residents in the U.S. MDS assessments occur a minimum of every 3 months, 
and more often for patients with a major recent change in clinical status and those receiving 
care under the Medicare Skilled Nursing Facility (SNF) benefit.
Our study population comprised U.S. nursing home residents age 65 and older who were 
hospitalized for AMI between May 1, 2007 and March 31, 2010, had resided in a nursing 
home for at least 30 days prior to the AMI hospitalization, were not using a beta blocker for 
at least four months prior to hospitalization, and returned to a nursing home after hospital 
discharge (see Appendix 1 and Zullo et al21 for additional details). We defined 
hospitalization with AMI based on a hospital admission or discharge claim with ICD9 code 
410.XX or 411.1 as a primary or secondary diagnosis. We excluded patients who died, were 
rehospitalized, or otherwise left the nursing home within 14 days of hospital discharge, 
because in such short-stay situations it is difficult to reliably ascertain beta blocker use. We 
also excluded patients with very poor prognosis at baseline (Changes in Health, End-Stage 
Disease, and Signs and Symptoms [CHESS] score of 5 or hospice),22 patients who were not 
continuously enrolled in Medicare Part D during the study period or had no Part D claims 
following hospitalization, and patients who were enrolled in a Medicare Advantage plan at 
any point during this period. Finally, we excluded subjects with extremely poor functional 
status prior to hospitalization (Morris ADL score ≥24/28) since they had little room for 
further functional decline.23
Measures
Our exposure of interest was use of a beta blocker in the immediate post-hospital period. We 
defined this as a Part D claim for an oral beta blocker within 30 days of resuming Part D 
coverage after hospital discharge. Part D covers at least 81% of nursing home residents and 
in most cases is the sole source of prescription drug coverage for these patients.24 For the 
subset of patients who return to the nursing home under the Medicare Skilled Nursing 
Facility (SNF) benefit, resumption of Part D claims is temporarily delayed. Therefore, we 
conducted a companion validation study to evaluate the performance of our beta blocker 
exposure measure in this subset. This study confirmed the validity of our measure (see 
Appendix 1).
Our primary outcome was functional decline. We defined this as a loss of 3 points on a 
validated 28-point scale of independence in activities of daily living (ADLs) between the

 pre-hospital baseline and the first available assessment following hospitalization, up to 3 
months after discharge.23 A 3-point drop corresponds to a major loss of independence in 1 
ADL or incremental losses in 2 or more ADLs. In a sensitivity analysis, we evaluated the 
outcome as a 4-point (more substantial) decline in function. We chose a 90-day outcome 
period because it is long enough to be clinically meaningful, but short enough that many of 
these highly vulnerable patients have not yet died, a competing outcome which complicates 
interpretation of longer-term functional outcomes.
Other key outcome measures included death and re-hospitalization within 90 days of the 
index hospital discharge. We used data from Medicare Part A and Medicare enrollment files 
to identify hospital admissions and date of death. We also explored two composite 
outcomes: time to hospitalization or death, and time to hospitalization, death, or functional 
decline.
Information on chronic conditions and characteristics of the index hospitalization were 
obtained from Medicare Part A data. Overall, this data source is more accurate for 
identifying chronic conditions than MDS 2.0.25–28 MDS 2.0 provided data on other patient 
characteristics including functional and cognitive status, geriatric syndromes, and symptoms, 
including validated scales such as the Cognitive Performance Score (CPS) and CHESS 
score.22,29
We used the OSCAR dataset to evaluate a variety of nursing home facility characteristics 
such as staffing, resident mix and quality indicators.
Analyses
We used propensity score-based methods to evaluate the relationship between beta blocker 
exposure and our outcomes of interest. Following an intention-to-treat framework, we 
defined subjects as beta blocker users or non-users throughout the study period based on 
their exposure in the immediate post-AMI period.
We estimated the propensity score via a logistic regression model that used 93 variables to 
predict beta blocker use. Variables included sociodemographic characteristics, chronic 
medical conditions, baseline medication use, prior hospitalization history, baseline 
functional and cognitive status, geriatric syndromes, symptoms, characteristics of the AMI 
hospitalization, and nursing home characteristics (Appendix 2). To evaluate whether vital 
signs, laboratory test results, and measures of cardiac function could result in unmeasured 
confounding, we conducted a companion validation study using national VA data, which 
unlike Medicare claims data contains information on these parameters. We found no 
evidence that the absence of these factors would substantially alter our results (Appendix 3).
To match beta blocker users with non-users who had similar propensity scores, we first 
discarded subjects in the top and bottom 1% of the propensity score distribution so as to 
exclude areas of non-overlap. We then applied a 1:1 greedy 5-to-1 digit matching algorithm 
without replacement.30 We evaluated the quality of resulting matches by comparing 
standardized differences between groups for each covariate in our model, and by using t-
tests to assess differences in the distribution of propensity scores.31,32

 Our propensity matching yielded excellent covariate balance, so we did not further adjust for 
baseline covariates in our models. Because we excluded people who died or were re-
hospitalized during the first 14 days after hospital discharge, we did not consider outcomes 
that occurred during this period, thus effectively beginning our outcome analyses at day 14 
after hospitalization.
We used Cox proportional hazards models to determine the impact of beta blocker use on 
time to death. We used the method of Fine and Gray (similar to Cox regression) to evaluate 
the impact of beta blocker use on time to rehospitalization while accounting for the 
competing outcome of death.33 Finally, we used multinomial logit models to evaluate the 
impact of beta blocker use on functional decline.28 At the end of the 90 day followup period, 
subjects were classified as alive without functional decline, having had functional decline 
documented in the first MDS assessment of that period, or having died without evidence of 
functional decline on the first MDS assessment.
We used both multiplicative and additive interaction terms to evaluate whether the impact of 
beta blockers on outcomes varied across subject characteristics. These characteristics 
included levels of baseline functional status, cognitive function, age, and presence or 
absence of an ICU or CCU stay during the AMI hospitalization. The distribution of 
propensity scores was very similar for beta blocker users and non-users within each 
subgroup, suggesting that stratifying patients into subgroups did not threaten covariate 
balance (Appendix 4).
The decision to exclude patients who died or were rehospitalized within 14 days after the 
AMI discharge has the potential to create selection bias. To evaluate this, we repeated our 
main analyses using inverse probability of selection weighting.34,35 This approach weighted 
subjects according to their similarity to individuals who were excluded due to death 
(N=1,859) or re-hospitalization (N=2,444) in the first 14 days, thus estimating treatment 
effects as if these people had been included in the analysis. In another sensitivity analysis, 
we controlled for use of other cardiovascular medications post-AMI using multinomial 
logistic regression in our propensity-matched cohort.
We also evaluated several alternate approaches to determine if our results were stable across 
different analytic techniques. These included stratifying by propensity score quintile and 
deciles, controlling for propensity score as a covariate, using inverse probability of treatment 
weights, performing time-dependent analyses. In each case, results were similar to our main 
approach (Appendix 5).
Results
Our initial cohort included 8,953 new beta blocker users and 6,767 non-users. Before 
matching, beta blocker users were more likely to have been in an ICU or CCU during the 
hospital stay and to return to the nursing home on the Medicare SNF-benefit care pathway, 
and less likely to have a prior diagnosis of angina pectoris or unstable angina (Table 1 and 
Appendix 6).

 Propensity score matching yielded a cohort of 5,496 new beta blocker users and an equal 
number of non-users (Table 1). Mean age was 84 years. The distribution of propensity scores 
was nearly identical between the matched groups (P=0.63), and all but 2 variables had 
standardized mean differences of 0.03 or less (Appendix 6). This is consistent with excellent 
covariate balance between groups.31 Beta blocker users and non-users had equal time 
between nursing home readmission and their first ADL assessment (median 22 days, IQR 
11–29 days, P=0.97 for difference). New beta blockers users were more likely than non-
users to be prescribed other cardiovascular medications in the post-AMI period, including 
statins (49% vs 32%, P<.0001) and ACE inhibitors (44% vs. 31%, P<.0001), but not 
angiotensin receptor blockers (8% vs 7%, P=.17).
Within 3 months after hospital discharge, 1,328 of 10,992 subjects (12%) experienced 
functional decline, 2,782 (25%) were rehospitalized, and 1,541 (14%) died. Some patients 
experienced more than one outcome; e.g. were rehospitalized and then died.
Beta blocker users had a higher rate of functional decline than non-users. In the first 90 days 
after AMI, the odds of functional decline were 1.14 (95% CI, 1.02–1.28) times greater in 
patients receiving beta blockers than in those not using beta blockers (Table 2). The number 
needed to treat to cause one patient to have functional decline was 52 (95% CI, 32–141). 
Results were similar using the more stringent threshold of a 4-point decline on the Morris 
ADL scale: using this definition, 1,165 subjects (11%) had functional decline, and beta 
blocker users were more likely to decline (OR 1.16, 95% CI, 1.02–1.31).
Beta blocker users were less likely than non-users to die within 90 days of hospital discharge 
(hazard ratio [HR] 0.74, 95% CI, 0.67–0.83; Figure 1 and Table 2). The number needed to 
treat to prevent one death was 26 (95% CI, 19–39). Beta blocker use had no impact on time 
to re-hospitalization (HR 1.06, 95% CI 0.98–1.14).
Beta blocker use had no significant effect on a composite outcome of time to death, 
hospitalization, or functional decline (HR 0.98, 95% CI 0.94–1.03). Beta blocker use 
showed a borderline small protective effect for a composite outcome that only included time 
to death or hospitalization (HR 0.94, 95% CI 0.88–1.00).
The impact of beta blocker use on death was similar across a variety of patient 
characteristics (Figure 3). However, the impact of beta blocker use on functional decline 
varied according to patients’ baseline cognitive and functional status (Figure 3 and 
Appendix 7). Among nursing home residents with moderate or severe cognitive deficits, beta 
blocker users were substantially more likely than non-users to experience functional decline 
(OR 1.34, 95% CI 1.11 – 1.61), with a number needed to harm of 36 (95% CI, 24–76). 
Similarly, among residents with severe functional dependence at baseline, beta blocker users 
had greater risk of functional decline than did non-users (OR 1.32, 95% CI 1.10–1.59), with 
a number needed to harm of 25 (95% CI, 16–55). In contrast, beta blocker use did not 
increase the risk of functional decline in people with intact cognition or mild dementia (OR 
1.03, 95% CI 0.89–1.20) or in those with less impaired levels of functioning prior to their 
hospitalization for AMI (OR 1.05, 95% CI 0.86–1.27 and OR 0.99, 95% CI 0.77–1.26,

 respectively). The P values for effect modification on the multiplicative scale were 0.03 for 
baseline cognitive status and 0.06 for baseline functional status.
The main results were similar after applying inverse probability of selection weights, 
although the point estimate for the impact of beta blockers on functional decline was slightly 
attenuated, with 95% confidence intervals crossing 1 (OR 1.09, 95% CI 0.96–1.24). Similar 
patterns held for results of subgroup analyses using selection weights (Appendix 8). Finally, 
results were similar after controlling for use of other cardiovascular medications in the post-
AMI setting (Appendix 5).
Discussion
In this national study of older nursing home residents, using beta blockers after acute 
myocardial infarction resulted in a 26% relative reduction in 90-day mortality, with a 
number needed to treat of 26 to prevent one death. Similar levels of risk reduction were 
found across a wide variety of patient subgroups. However, beta blockers conferred a 14% 
relative increase in the odds of functional decline, with a number need to harm of 52 to 
cause one case of functional decline. This risk was particularly high for people with 
moderate or severe cognitive impairment or a high degree of functional dependence at 
baseline. In these groups, beta blockers increased the odds of functional decline by 32–34%, 
with a number needed to harm of 25 to 36. In contrast, nursing home residents with 
relatively preserved cognitive and functional abilities did not appear to suffer adverse 
functional consequences from receiving beta blockers.
Our findings of mortality benefit are consistent with the results of other observational studies 
of beta blocker use among the old-old, frail, and functionally impaired.6–9,36,37 Regarding 
harms, little is known about the impact of beta blockers on functional status. However, these 
agents increase risk of fatigue (particularly first-generation agents such as propranolol)12 
and have been associated with increased rates of dizziness38,39 and decreased subjective 
sense of well-being,40,41 although no consistent effect has been found on rates of 
depression12 or falls.13,42
Our results confirm the suspicion of many physicians that poor cognitive and functional 
status increase the risk of medication-induced harms in older adults. However, they call into 
question the more general practice whereby older adults are less likely to receive guideline-
recommended medications after AMI regardless of their mental or physical abilities.7,10,11,43 
For nursing home residents with intact cognition or mild dementia, and in those with non-
severe levels of functional dependency, we found substantial mortality benefit and no 
functional harms. So, for most such patients treatment is appropriate. In contrast, for nursing 
home residents with extensive functional dependency or moderate to severe dementia 
(roughly corresponding to a Folstein Mini Mental State Exam score of 14/30 or lower),29 
resolving the tradeoff between reduced mortality and increased risk of functional decline 
will depend on patient preferences, as expressed directly or through surrogate decision-
makers.44,45 For cognitively or functionally impaired nursing home residents who are more 
concerned about functional decline than death, avoiding treatment may be preferable. This is

 a large population: more than half of nursing home residents have high levels of functional 
dependence, and two-thirds have moderate or severe cognitive impairment.46
Because this is an observational study, we cannot rule out the possibility of confounding. 
However, several factors support the robustness of our findings. We obtained excellent 
balance of baseline covariates across treatment groups and consistent results using several 
alternate analytic approaches. Moreover, younger and healthier patients are more likely to 
receive secondary prevention medications after AMI.7,10,11,43,47 This would bias results 
toward better outcomes in beta blocker users. Instead, functional outcomes were in the 
opposite direction of this expected bias. Another important consideration is co-interventions. 
People who used beta blockers after AMI were also more likely to receive statins and ACE-
inhibitors in the post-AMI period. Controlling for these differences slightly attenuated the 
observed associations between beta blocker use and our outcomes of interest, although the 
overall pattern remained.
To enable robust assessment of beta blocker exposure, we excluded subjects who died or 
were rehospitalized within the first 14 days of hospital discharge. This prevented us from 
evaluating the impact of beta blockers on outcomes during this period. Thus, our results 
should be interpreted as providing evidence about the impact of beta blocker use on 
outcomes starting 14 days after discharge, among people who had survived and remained in 
the nursing home until then. In addition, these exclusions could induce selection bias.34,35 
However, while our sensitivity analyses were consistent with the possibility of mild selection 
bias, we found little evidence of bias sufficiently large to invalidate our overall findings.
Use of beta blockers after myocardial infarction resulted in substantial reductions in 
mortality among older nursing home residents. At the same time, use of these agents 
resulted in worse functional outcomes among nursing home residents with substantial 
cognitive or functional deficits. In this highly vulnerable group, understanding the 
importance that individual patients place on avoiding death and on avoiding functional 
decline will be critical to guiding decision-making about use of these medications.

 Figure 1. Association between beta-blocker use and death and re-hospitalization
Panel A shows time to death among beta blocker users and non-users. Panel B shows time to 
re-hospitalization in the 2 groups. There are no events in the first 14 days after hospital 
discharge because subjects who left the nursing home for any reason in the first 14 days after 
hospital discharge were excluded from analysis.
Red lines are beta blocker-users; blue lines are non-users. Shaded areas are the 95% 
confidence intervals around each survival curve.

 Figure 2. Impact of beta blockers on functional decline and death: subgroup analyses
P values show the significance of effect modification on the multiplicative scale. Values for 
additive effect modification are as follows, and are expressed as relative excess risk due to 
interaction (RERI). For the outcome of functional decline, RERI (95% CI) for moderate 
ADL dependence is 0.11 (−0.36 to 0.58), P=0.65 and for high ADL dependence is 0.66 
(0.20 to 1.13), p<0.01, indicating positive additive interaction for high ADL dependence; 
RERI (95% CI) for worse cognitive performance score is 0.08 (−0.12 to 0.29), P=.42; RERI 
(95% CI) for higher age is −0.14 (−0.38 to 0.11), P=.27; RERI (95% CI) for ICU/CCU stay 
is −0.03 (−0.29 to 0.24), P=0.85. For the outcome of death, RERI (95% CI) for moderate 
ADL dependence is −0.35 (−0.70 to 0.01), P=0.05, indicating potential negative additive 
interaction, and for higher ADL dependence is −0.19 (−0.54 to 0.17), p=0.31; RERI (95% 
CI) for worse cognitive performance score is −0.15 (−0.42 to 0.12), P=.29; RERI (95% CI) 
for higher age is 0.00 (−0.21 to 0.22), P=.97; RERI (95% CI) for ICU/CCU stay is −0.05 
(−0.26 to 0.14), P=0.60.
*ADL score <14 corresponds to independence or requiring limited assistance with ADLs; 
ADL score 14–19 corresponds to requiring extensive assistance; and ADL score 20 or above 
corresponds to extensive dependence on others to perform ADLs.
*CPS score 0–2 corresponds to normal to mildly impaired cognition including mild 
dementia. CPS score 3–6 corresponds to moderate or severe cognitive impairment (roughly 
equivalent to a Folstein Mini Mental State Exam score of 14/30 or lower).
