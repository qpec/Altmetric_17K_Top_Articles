Abstract
Background
Neonatal hypoglycaemia is common, affecting up to 15% of newborns, and can cause
brain damage. Currently, there are no strategies, beyond early feeding, to prevent neonatal
hypoglycaemia. Our aim was to determine a dose of 40% oral dextrose gel that will prevent
neonatal hypoglycaemia in newborn babies at risk.
Methods and Findings
We conducted a randomised, double-blind, placebo-controlled dose-finding trial of buccal
dextrose gel to prevent neonatal hypoglycaemia at two hospitals in New Zealand. Babies at
risk of hypoglycaemia (infant of a mother with diabetes, late preterm delivery, small or large
birthweight, or other risk factors) but without indication for admission to a neonatal intensive
care unit (NICU) were randomly allocated either to one of four treatment groups: 40% dex-
trose at one of two doses (0.5 ml/kg = 200 mg/kg, or 1 ml/kg = 400 mg/kg), either once at 1
h of age or followed by three additional doses of dextrose (0.5 ml/kg before feeds in the first
12 h); or to one of four corresponding placebo groups. Treatments were administered by
massaging gel into the buccal mucosa. The primary outcome was hypoglycaemia (<2.6
mM) in the first 48 h. Secondary outcomes included admission to a NICU, admission for
hypoglycaemia, and breastfeeding at discharge and at 6 wk. Prespecified potential dose
limitations were tolerance of gel, time taken to administer, messiness, and acceptability to
parents. From August 2013 to November 2014, 416 babies were randomised. Compared to
babies randomised to placebo, the risk of hypoglycaemia was lowest in babies randomised
to a single dose of 200 mg/kg dextrose gel (relative risk [RR] 0.68; 95% confidence interval
[CI] 0.47–0.99, p = 0.04) but was not significantly different between dose groups (p = 0.21).
Compared to multiple doses, single doses of gel were better tolerated, quicker to

 administer, and less messy, but these limitations were not different between dextrose and
placebo gel groups. Babies who received any dose of dextrose gel were less likely to
develop hypoglycaemia than those who received placebo (RR 0.79; 95% CI 0.64–0.98, p =
0.03; number needed to treat = 10, 95% CI 5–115). Rates of NICU admission were similar
(RR 0.64; 95% CI 0.33–1.25, p = 0.19), but admission for hypoglycaemia was less common
in babies randomised to dextrose gel (RR 0.46; 95% CI 0.21–1.01, p = 0.05). Rates of
breastfeeding were similar in both groups. Adverse effects were uncommon and not differ-
ent between groups. A limitation of this study was that most of the babies in the trial were
infants of mothers with diabetes (73%), which may reduce the applicability of the results to
babies from other risk groups.
Conclusions
The incidence of neonatal hypoglycaemia can be reduced with a single dose of buccal 40%
dextrose gel 200 mg/kg. A large randomised trial (Hypoglycaemia Prevention with Oral
Dextrose [hPOD]) is under way to determine the effects on NICU admission and later
outcomes.

Author Summary
Why Was This Study Done?
• Neonatal hypoglycaemia is common, with 30% of babies born at risk for hypoglycaemia
and half of these developing low blood-glucoseconcentrations.
• Babies who develop hypoglycaemia are at increased risk of neurodevelopmental
impairment.
• There are no strategies, other than feeding the babies formula, for preventing hypogly-
caemia in at-risk babies,
• Oral dextrose gel has been shown to be effective at treating neonatal hypoglycaemia.
What Did the Researchers Do and Find?
• The authors conducted a randomised controlled trial of prophylactic oral dextrose gel in
babies at risk of developing neonatal hypoglycaemia (infants of mothers with diabetes,
small, large, and preterm) to determine the most effective dose of oral dextrose gel to
reduce the incidence of hypoglycaemia.
• Four hundred and sixteen at-risk babies were randomised to receive either a standard
(200 mg/kg) or high (400 mg/kg) dose of dextrose gel or placebo, either once or followed
by three more standard doses before feeds.

 • The authors found that 200 mg/kg (0.5 ml/kg of 40% dextrose gel) was effective at reduc-
ing the incidence of hypoglycaemia (relative risk [RR] 0.68; 95% confidence interval [CI]
0.47–0.99, p = 0.04).
What Do These Findings Mean?
• A single dose of prophylactic oral dextrose gel reduces the incidence of neonatal hypo-
glycaemia in babies born at risk.
• Further research is needed to determine if oral dextrose gel also reduces rates of neonatal
intensive care unit (NICU) admission and neurodevelopmental impairment.
• Most of the babies in the trial were babies of mothers with diabetes, so these results may
not be as applicable to babies from other risk groups.
Introduction
Approximately 30% of newborn babies require multiple blood tests for screening for neonatal
hypoglycaemia under current guidelines. Half of these will develop hypoglycaemia [1], and an
unknown proportion will experience brain damage and developmental delay as a result.
Despite recommendations in clinical guidelines that prophylactic measures should be taken in
babies at risk of neonatal hypoglycaemia [2–4], there currently are no strategies beyond early
feeding for prevention [5]. Dextrose gel has been shown to be effective in treating neonatal
hypoglycaemia, without detrimental effect on breastfeeding [6]. We therefore considered that
it might also be effective as prophylaxis against neonatal hypoglycaemia. However, we first
needed to determine an effective dose of dextrose gel to prevent neonatal hypoglycaemia.
A dose of 200 mg/kg glucose is the standard treatment dose of intravenous glucose adminis-
tered as a “mini bolus” to babies with hypoglycaemia [7] and is also the dose demonstrated to
be effective in treatment of neonatal hypoglycaemia with dextrose gel [6]. However, we consid-
ered that a single dose of 200 mg/kg glucose might not be adequate for prevention of hypogly-
caemia, as babies at risk may have a prolonged nadir in blood glucose after birth [8–10] and
higher plasma insulin concentrations and lower rates of hepatic glucose production in the first
hours after birth than those not at risk [8]. We therefore also investigated both a higher single
dose (400 mg/kg) and repeated doses in the first 12 h. Babies were randomised to the resulting
eight dosage groups. The primary outcome was neonatal hypoglycaemia in the first 48 h.
Aim
The aim of this study was to determine a dose of 40% oral dextrose gel that will prevent neona-
tal hypoglycaemia in newborn babies at risk.
Methods
The trial was approved by the Northern A Health and Disability Ethics Committee of New Zea-
land (13/NTA/8).

 Trial Design
We undertook this randomised, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial at two hospitals provid-
ing maternity and neonatal services(Auckland City Hospital and Waitakere Hospital) in Auck-
land, New Zealand. Eligible babies were infants of mothers with diabetes (any type of diabetes),
late preterm (35 or 36 wk gestation), small (birthweight < 10th centile on population or cus-
tomised birthweight charts or < 2.5 kg) or large (birthweight > 90th centile on population or
customised birthweight charts or > 4.5 kg), or those with other risk factors (e.g., maternal med-
ication such as β-blockers). Babies also satisfied all of the following inclusion criteria at the
time of randomisation; �35 wk gestation, birthweight � 2.2 kg, < 1 h old, no apparent indica-
tion for admission to a neonatal intensive care unit (NICU) (this included a special care baby
unit), unlikely to require admission to a NICU for any other reasons, and mother intending to
breastfeed. Exclusion criteria were major congenital abnormality, previous formula feed or
intravenous fluids given, previous diagnosis of hypoglycaemia, admitted to a NICU, or immi-
nent admission to a NICU. Mothers of babies who were likely to become eligible (maternal dia-
betes, likely late preterm birth, or anticipated high or low birth weight) were identified through
lead maternity carers and antenatal clinics and provided with an information sheet before the
birth. Written informed consent was obtained before the birth by a member of the research
team and confirmed verbally after the birth.
The trial was prospectively registered with the Australian New Zealand Clinical Trials Regis-
try, number ACTRN12613000322730. The study protocol is available online at https://
researchspace.auckland.ac.nz/handle/2292/25006.
Randomisation
Eligible babies for whom consent had been obtained were randomised within the first hour
after birth. We used computer-generated blocked randomisation with variable block sizes to
assign babies to one of eight treatment arms. Allocation was to either 40% dextrose or placebo
gel and to one of the following dose regimens: 0.5 ml/kg (200 mg/kg) once, 1 ml/kg (400 mg/
kg) once, 0.5 ml/kg for four doses (total 800 mg/kg), 1 ml/kg once followed by 0.5 ml/kg for a
further three doses (total 1,000 mg/kg) (Fig 1). The allocation ratios were dextrose:placebo2:1,
with the intention that the placebo arms would be combined for analysis, single:multiple dose
1:1, and low:high dose 1:1. Randomisation was stratified by centre and then by prioritised allo-
cation to primary risk factor—i.e., if more than one risk factor was present, primary risk factor
was allocated in the order of maternal diabetes, preterm, small, large, or other. For example, a
baby who was both preterm and whose mother had diabetes was allocated the primary risk fac-
tor of maternal diabetes. We assigned twins independently. Research staff entered demographic
and entry criteria data into an online randomisation website that provided a number corre-
sponding to a numbered trial pack that contained either a single 5 ml prefilled syringe of either
40% dextrose gel or an identical-appearing placebo (2% hydroxymethylcellulose) or four num-
bered syringes of gel (1 x 5 ml and 3 x 2.5 ml, all containing either dextrose or placebo gel). Cli-
nicians, families, and all study investigators were masked to treatment group allocation
throughout the study and remain so for the planned follow-up.
Interventions
Study gel was massaged into the buccal mucosa, either once at 1 h of age (0.5 ml/kg or 1 ml/kg)
or an additional three times (0.5 ml/kg) before feeds in the first 12 h, with gel given no more
frequently than every 3 h. Each dose of gel was followed by a breastfeed. Feeding was according
to standard hospital guidelines, which included breastfeeding within 1 h after birth and then

 on demand not less than every 3 to 4 h. Supplemental formula was not given routinely but
could be given on parent or clinician decision.
We measured blood glucose concentrations first at 2 h after birth. Subsequent blood glucose
measurement was according to the local hospital protocol, with prefeed blood glucose mea-
surements every 2 to 4 h for at least the first 12 h, and until there were three consecutive blood
glucose concentrations of �2.6 mM. Babies who developed hypoglycaemia were managed by
the hospital clinical team according to the standard clinical practice at each site, including sup-
plementation with formula, treatment with 40% dextrose gel, and admission to a NICU for
intravenous dextrose if required.
All blood glucose concentrations were measured in whole blood by the glucose oxidase
method, either with a portable blood glucose analyser (i-STAT, Abbott Laboratories, Abbott
Park, Illinois, United States) or a combined metabolite/bloodgas analyser (e.g., ABL 700, Radi-
ometer, Copenhagen, Denmark).
Babies whose parent(s) gave consent had a continuous glucose monitor sensor (iPRO2,
Medtronic, MiniMed, Northridge, California, US) inserted subcutaneously into the lateral
aspect of the thigh as soon as possible after birth. Interstitial glucose concentrations cannot be

 viewed on this monitor in real time and therefore were not available to clinicians and had no
influence upon clinical management. The sensors remained in situ for at least 48 h. These data
(n = 137) will be reported separately.
Parents were contacted at 3 d and 6 wk after birth to determine feeding method and were
asked about any health events since discharge and parental perceived treatment allocation on
the second occasion.
Outcomes
The primary outcome was hypoglycaemia, defined as any blood glucose concentration < 2.6
mM in the first 48 h after birth. Secondaryoutcomes were admission to a NICU (defined as
admission for > 4 h); admission to a NICU for hypoglycaemia; hyperglycaemia (blood glucose
concentration > 10 mM); breastfeeding at discharge from hospital (full or exclusive); received
any formula prior to discharge from hospital; formula feeding at 6 wk of age; cost of care until
discharge home (to be reported separately), and maternal satisfaction at 6 wk. An independent
data monitoring committee undertook interim analyses after 120, 240, and 360 babies had
been randomised and recommended that recruitment continue. The safety monitoring com-
mittee received reports of serious adverse events (seizures and death) and other adverse events:
hyperglycaemia, late hypoglycaemia (blood glucose concentration < 2.6 mM for the first time
after 12 h of age), delayed feeding (failure to establish breastfeeding without supplements by
the end of day 3), and systemic sepsis [9].
Limitations of the trial intervention were defined as tolerance of gel (small spill [few drops],
moderate spill [half of volume administered], and large spill [all of volume administered])
assessed by the clinician at time of administration, length of time to administer dose (time to
massage gel into baby’s buccal mucosa), messiness (parental report), hyperglycaemia, late
hypoglycaemia, delayed feeding, and acceptability of trial intervention to parent(s) (acceptable,
some inconvenience, major inconvenience, or unacceptable).
Statistical Analysis
Power and sample size. Based on our previous studies [1], we estimated that 50% of eligi-
ble babies would experience hypoglycaemia. We designed the trial to have 80% power to detect
a 25% absolute reduction (relative reduction of 50%) in the incidence of neonatal hypoglycae-
mia from 50% to 25% (two-sided, alpha = 0.05). Four placebo groups were required to mask
the difference in gel volume between the lower and higher initial doses of gel. However, we
anticipated combining the two single dose placebo groups for analysis and doing the same for
the two multiple dose placebo groups. Therefore, we required half the number of babies in each
of the four placebo arms and allowed for a 5% dropout rate, giving a total sample size of 415
babies (66 in each treatment arm, 33 in each placebo arm).
Selectionof the optimal dose. We anticipated that the selection of the optimal dose for
prevention of hypoglycaemia would be based on a combination of the dose required for ade-
quate efficacywith a minimal burden of side effects (expected to be uncommon), together with
pragmatic consideration of the ease of administration, simplicity, quantitative evaluation of
weighted tolerance of the intervention scores (limitations), and cost.
To visualise the association between dose and outcome, the cumulative administered dose
for the single and multiple dose arms (i.e., 0, 200, 400, 800, and 1,000 mg/kg) was plotted as the
independent variable against reduction in the proportion of babies with at least one episode of
hypoglycaemia, summarised as a percentage (± 95% confidence interval [CI], binomial
method), and plotted as the dependent variable.

 The response to single placebo and multiple placebo doses was compared, and the placebo
arms were pooled into a single “0” mg/kg dose. Logistic regression modelling was then used to
estimate the odds of hypoglycaemia for each cumulative dose of glucose, adjusted for risk fac-
tors for hypoglycaemia (i.e., sex, gestational age, and mode of delivery). Inspection of this func-
tion was used to determine which dose(s) at the upper limit of the 95% CI excluded a 50%
reduction (the prespecified efficacyendpoint), i.e., a difference in odds of at least one third.
Where indicated in table legends, relative risks (RRs) are also presented, calculated using a
multivariable model adjusted for prespecified risk factors for hypoglycaemia.
We anticipated that these data might yield a number of “possible” doses in which the 95%
CI for the odds of hypoglycaemia was significantly lower than the placebo dose (i.e., P odds of
hypoglycaemia < 0.05). Therefore, we also undertook a complementary analysis of limitations
at each dose level.
The odds of at least one limitation for each cumulative dose arm relative to the placebo dose
was estimated (with 95% CIs) and plotted, and the likelihoodthat this estimate differed from the
placebo arm was reported. Additionally, a limitation score, comprising the sum of weights assigned
to the predeterminedlimitations (maximum score 18.5), was summarised for each cumulative dose
arm (median ± 95% CI, Mid-P method) and plotted. We anticipated that about 5% of untreated
babies might experiencehyperglycaemia, 20% late hypoglycaemia, and 25% delayed feeding. We
anticipated that seizures due to hypoglycaemia and infant death were extremely unlikely.
Analysis was performed using SAS (v9.3 SAS Institute) on an intention-to-treat basis. All
tests were two-tailed, and p < 0.05 was considered statistically significant. Since these were
exploratory analyses, no adjustment for multiplicity was performed. Data are presented as
number (%), median (range), mean difference (95% CI), and RR (95% CIs) as appropriate.
Results
Baseline Details
A total of 416 babies were randomised between August 3, 2013, and November 13, 2014 (Fig 1).
Demographic and baseline characteristics were similar for all randomisation groups (Table 1).
The median (range) birthweight was 3,190 (2,200, 5,255) g and gestational age 38 (35, 42) wk;
301/415 babies (73%) were infants of mothers with diabetes, and 199/415 (48%) were born by
caesarean delivery. Primary risk factors for hypoglycaemia were similar across all treatment
groups. A similar proportion of mothers in each group were uncertain as to the gel type the baby
received (163/257 [63%] in those randomised to dextrose gel versus 77/126 [61%] in those rando-
mised to placebo) or thought the baby had received dextrose gel (67/277 [24%] randomised to
dextrose versus 34/126 [25%] randomised to placebo), demonstrating effective masking.
The overall incidence of hypoglycaemia was 186/415 (45%, 95% CI 40%–50%), and 32/415
babies (8%, 95% CI 5.5%–10.7%) were admitted to NICU, of whom most (23/415, 6%, 95% CI
3.7%–8.2%) were admitted for hypoglycaemia. For those babies who became hypoglycaemic,
the median (range) age at first detection was 2.3 (1.1, 44.5) h. Formula was given to 232/415
(56%, 95% CI 51%–61%) during hospital admission, with the most common indications being
medical intervention for hypoglycaemia (93/232, 40%, 95% CI 34%–47%) and maternal choice
(73/232, 31%, 95% CI 26%–38%). At discharge from hospital, 279/407 (69%, 95% CI 64%–
73%) babies were fully or exclusively breastfeeding.
Compliance
There was no difference between placebo and dextrose gel groups in timing of gel administra-
tion or in volume of gel administered (Table 2). Thirty babies did not receive all doses of gel
according to protocol, including 13 who were withdrawn from the trial prior to completing all

 doses, 7 with missed doses, and 8 who received an incorrect volume. These protocol deviations
in gel administration occurred with similar frequency for babies allocated to dextrose gel and
placebo (21/277, 8% versus 9/138, 7%). Only 1/209 babies (<1%) allocated to a single dose did
not receive all allocated gel, compared to 26/206 babies (13%) allocated to multiple doses
(RR = 0.04, 95% CI 0.01–0.28, p = 0.0013).
Twenty-four babies (24/415, 6%) were withdrawn from the trial after randomisation (Fig 1),
although consent was given to obtain outcome data from the clinical records for these babies.
Withdrawal rates were similar in babies randomised to dextrose gel and placebo (17/277 [6%]
versus 7/138 [5%], p = 0.60) but were higher in babies randomised to multiple doses than in
Table 2. Details of study gel and supplementary dextrose administration for each dosage group.

 those randomised to a single dose of gel (17/206 [8%] versus 7/209 [3%], RR 1.05, 95% CI
1.00–1.11, p = 0.034). The most common reasons for withdrawal were parental concern about
blood sampling (despite this not being determined by the trial protocol) and clinician uncer-
tainty about the trial protocol.
Efficacy of Different Doses
When cumulative doses of dextrose gel were plotted against the odds of developing hypogly-
caemia, with adjustment for sex, gestational age, and mode of birth (Fig 2), the odds of hypo-
glycaemia were not significantly lower when all dose regimes of dextrose gel were compared
against placebo gel (p = 0.21). However, the 95% CI for the 200 mg/kg dose relative to placebo
did not include unity.
In post hoc exploratory analyses, there was no difference in median blood glucose concen-
tration between dose regimes (Fig 3). Amongst babies randomised to multiple doses of dextrose
gel who became hypoglycaemic, 56/88 (64%) had done so before the time that they would have
completed their allocated four doses of gel.
Overall Efficacy
Babies randomised to any dose of dextrose gel were less likely to develop hypoglycaemia than
those randomised to placebo (RR 0.79, 95% CI 0.64–0.98, p = 0.03; number needed to

 treat = 10, 95% CI 5–115, Table 3). They also developed hypoglycaemia later (dextrose 3.7
[1.1–44.5] h, placebo 2.1 [1.5–43.8] h, p = 0.03). However, the lowest blood glucose concentra-
tion in those who did experience hypoglycaemia was similar for babies randomised to dextrose
gel or to placebo (2.3 [0.6–2.5] mM versus 2.1 [1.1–2.5] mM, mean difference 0.08 mM, 95%
CI −0.02 to 0.18 mM, p = 0.13), as was the number of blood glucose measurements < 2.6 mM
in the first 48 h (mean [standard deviation (SD)] 1.8 [1.1] versus 2.0 [1.2], mean difference
−0.19, 95% CI −0.54 to 0.16 mM, p = 0.29). One quarter of the babies (109/415, 26%) received
supplementary dextrose in addition to study gel, either as open label 40% dextrose gel or intra-
venous dextrose, with similar rates in dextrose and placebo gel groups (67/277 [24%] versus
42/138 [30%], RR 0.79, 95% CI 0.57–1.10, p = 0.17, Table 2).
There was no difference between dextrose and placebo groups in the rate of admission to a
NICU (Table 3), although admission to a NICU for hypoglycaemia tended to be less common
in babies randomised to dextrose gel (RR 0.46, 95% CI 0.21–1.01, p = 0.05). Rates of breastfeed-
ing were similar in both groups at discharge (p = 0.92), on day 3 (p = 0.08), and at 6 wk
(p = 0.53) (Table 3). Parental satisfaction did not differ for babies who received single doses
rather than multiple doses (RR 1.06, 95% CI 1.00–1.13, p = 0.06) or for babies who received
dextrose or placebo gel (RR 0.95, 95% CI 0.90–1.01, p = 0.12).
In post hoc subgroup analysis, the effect of dextrose gel on the incidence of hypoglycaemia
was similar in babies with different primary risk factors.

kg is 1 ml/kg once, 800 mg/kg is 0.5 ml/kg for four doses, and 1,000 mg/kg is 1 ml/kg once followed by 0.5 ml/
kg for a further three doses. The box represents 25th to 75th percentiles. The horizontal bar within the box is
the median, and the solid dot within the box is the mean. The whiskers are 1.5 (interquartile range [IQR])
above and below the 25th and 75th percentile. Solid dots beyond the whiskers represent outliers.

Dose of Dextrose Gel to Prevent Neonatal Hypoglycaemia
PLOS Medicine | DOI:10.1371/journal.pmed.1002155

 Limitations
Overall, gel was well tolerated, with 918 of 1,030 doses (89%) associated with no spill or a small
spill, 33 (3%) with a moderate, and 13 (1%) with a large spill. At least one moderate or large
spill was more common in babies receiving multiple doses than after single doses (RR 7.94,
95% CI 2.85–22.09, p < 0.001) but was not different between babies receiving dextrose and pla-
cebo gel (RR 1.09, 95% CI 0.55–2.17, p = 0.80).
Most doses took 5 to 10 min to administer. Taking longer than 5 min to administer a dose
was more common for multiple doses than for single doses (RR 1.08, 95% CI 1.03–1.14,
p = 0.0036) but was similar for dextrose gel and placebo gel administration (RR 1.05, 95% CI
0.99–1.11, p = 0.13).
Similarly, parents reported more messiness with multiple doses than with single doses of gel
(RR 7.07, 95% CI 2.14–23.33, p = 0.0013) but no differences between dextrose and placebo gel
(RR 1.00, 95% CI 0.44–2.29, p = 0.99). Most parents found the gel acceptable (364/402, 91%),
with no differences between multiple and single doses or between dextrose and placebo gel.
No babies met the criteria for hyperglycaemia. There were no differences between treatment
groups in the incidence of late hypoglycaemia or delayed feeding (Table 4).
Total limitations scores were similar in all treatment groups. However, more babies in the
multiple dose group than in the single dose group experiencedat least one limitation
(score > 0, RR 1.03, 95% CI 1.00–1.07, p = 0.05), although this was similar in dextrose and pla-
cebo gel groups (RR 1.00, 95% CI 0.96–1.03, p = 0.83).
Adverse Effects
One baby developed seizures, without concurrent hypoglycaemia, that were not considered to
be related to the intervention. There were no neonatal or infant deaths. No babies developed
hyperglycaemia or systemic sepsis or had a first episode of hypoglycaemia after 48 h. Delayed
feeding occurredin 170/405 (42%, 95% CI 37%–47%) babies, and late hypoglycaemia in 14/
415 (3.4%, 95% CI 2.0%–5.6%), with similar rates in all treatment groups (Table 3).
Discussion
Our findings show that the most effective and well-tolerated dose of prophylactic oral dextrose
gel to reduce the incidence of neonatal hypoglycaemia in babies born at risk but without indica-
tion for a NICU admission is 200 mg/kg (0.5 ml/kg of 40% oral dextrose gel). Further, the
intervention was easy to administer, well tolerated, acceptable to parents, and not associated
with any adverse outcomes. Neonatal hypoglycaemia is a common problem, occurringin up to
15% of newborn babies and in 50% of those born at risk [1]. Management commonly includes
supplementary feeds with formula milk and/or separation of mother and baby for admission to
a NICU for more invasive management with intravenous dextrose. The use of formula milk is
associated with decreased breastfeeding rates [10], and admission to a NICU separates mother
and baby, making breastfeeding establishment more difficult as well as increasing health care
costs. Other than feeding early [5], there are no effective interventions for prophylaxis of neo-
natal hypoglycaemia in babies at risk. This trial is the first to demonstrate that oral dextrose gel
reduces the incidence of neonatal hypoglycaemia.
Neonatal hypoglycaemia occurs most frequently in the first 24 h after birth, with lower
blood glucose concentrations of �2 mM occurringmost often within the first 12 h [1]. Babies
at risk of neonatal hypoglycaemia commonly receive repeated feeds of supplemental formula
milk to manage low blood glucose measurements while maternal lactation is established [6,10].
Therefore, we decided to investigate the effect of a prophylactic regime of multiple doses of

 dextrose given within the first 12 h following birth. As with the single dose regime, we consid-
ered that both a standard and a higher initial dose might be of benefit.
Perhaps surprisingly, there was no evidence of a dose-response effect, with all dose
regimes having similar efficacy and resulting in similar median blood glucose concentrations.
However, the diagnosis of hypoglycaemia was later in babies randomised to dextrose gel,
although the incidence of late hypoglycaemia was unchanged, suggesting that the main effect
of dextrose gel may be in reducing the incidence of early hypoglycaemia. This is consistent
with our finding that two-thirds of babies randomised to multiple doses who developed
hypoglycaemia did so before the time that they would have received all doses. These babies
had already met the primary outcome, and therefore, any benefit of subsequent doses in
maintaining blood glucose concentrations would not be captured in this analysis. For the
same reason, the effective sample size was less than the number randomized in the multiple
dose groups, and it is therefore possible that the study was inadequately powered to detect
differences between single and multiple dose groups. Within the single dose groups, there
was no indication that higher doses might have been effective, with the proportion of hypo-
glycaemic babies in the 1 ml/kg dose group being closer to that in the placebo group than in
the 0.5 ml/kg dose group.
Each dose of dextrose gel was followed by a breast feed. We anticipated that the dextrose gel
would be rapidly absorbed into the buccal mucosa but alone would not be adequate to maintain
blood glucose concentrations for the length of the period between feeds. Although early colos-
trum contains few calories, it contains many other factors that are important for early neonatal
health, including metabolic regulation during the transition [11,12], and we considered it a pri-
ority to encourage early establishment of breastfeeding, with health benefits for both mother
and baby [13,14]. It was also possible that the gel might stimulate insulin production. Although
there is uncertainty whether increased blood glucose concentration in the early neonatal period
does induce an increase in insulin production [15], transient neonatal hyperinsulinism is the
likely mechanism underlying most transient neonatal hypoglycaemia [16].
It should be noted that we measured whole-bloodglucose concentrations using the i-STAT
portable clinical analyser, which utilises the glucose oxidase method and does not adjust the
results to plasma glucose concentrations. Screening of babies at risk for neonatal hypoglycae-
mia is commonly performed using whole blood and bedside analysers, rather than plasma,
because of the requirement for immediate results and the risk of glycolysis in specimens sent to
the lab [2,6]. Plasma glucose concentrations are approximately 10% to 18% higher than whole-
blood concentrations because of the higher water content of plasma [2]. Ten percent of blood
tests in this trial were analysed using the blood gas analyser in the NICU, usually after the baby
had been diagnosed with hypoglycaemia and admitted to the NICU. Good reliability between
the i-STAT and blood gas analysers in measuring blood glucose concentrations in this popula-
tion has previously been reported [17].
The eligibility criteria for this study were intended to select babies who would not need
NICU admission for other reasons and were therefore most likely to benefit if hypoglycaemia
could be avoided. Although admission to a NICU for hypoglycaemia appeared to be less com-
mon in babies allocated to dextrose gel, overall admission rates were similar in both groups.
However, this dose-findingtrial was not powered to detect a reduction in admission to NICUs
or later neurodevelopmental outcomes, and therefore, a larger trial is needed to determine the
effect of prophylactic dextrose gel on these important outcomes.
The potential negative impact of any supplement given during the neonatal period on
breastfeeding [10,18,19] necessitated close monitoring of feeding during the trial. In particular,
the use of dextrose gel for treatment of hypoglycaemia has previously been reported in one
small trial to reduce the volume of formula taken at the subsequent feed [20], although a larger,

 more recent trial was more reassuring and demonstrated reduced formula feeding rates at 2 wk
after treatment dextrose gel [6]. We found no effects of prophylactic dextrose gel on measures
of infant feeding (receipt of formula, delayed feeding, or breast feeding at discharge, on day 3,
or at 6 wk). However, although all mothers of babies in our trial intended to breast feed, 55% of
babies received formula before discharge, and 42% had not established full breast feeding by 72
h. This is perhaps not surprising given that 72% of mothers had diabetes and 48% underwent
caesarean delivery;both are risk factors for delayed onset of lactation [18]. There are few com-
parative data. One study of women birthing in a university hospital in the US, the majority of
whom intended to breastfeed and whose babies had no risk factors for hypoglycaemia, reported
in-hospital formula supplementation in 47%, with the commonest indication being perceived
insufficient milk supply [21]. Furthermore, delayed onset of lactation (�72 h after birth) has
been reported in 35% of healthy women [22].
We used a predefined assessment of limitations to assist with selecting the most appro-
priate dose, as we anticipated that more than one dose might be effective in preventing neo-
natal hypoglycaemia. As this prediction of similar efficacy proved correct, we aimed to
select the dose that would be most acceptable to clinical staff and parents, with fewest poten-
tial adverse effects and best tolerated by the baby. Although the weightings of each compo-
nent of the limitation score were assigned arbitrarily, they were based on our consensus
estimate of clinical importance. This was helpful in clarifying that multiple doses were more
likely than single doses to be associated with spilling, slower to administer, and considered
messy by parents. However, there were no differences between dextrose and placebo gel
groups.
The commonest risk factor for hypoglycaemia in participants in this trial was infant of a
mother with diabetes. This was in large part because women pregnant with potentially eligible
babies were approached antenatally, and we were able to identify women with diabetes more
readily than those in other risk groups. Although this may be considered a potential weakness
of this study, the incidence of neonatal hypoglycaemia was similar amongst the risk groups.
Furthermore, prespecifiedsubgroup analysis did not show any difference in efficacyof dextrose
gel to prevent hypoglycaemia dependent upon the primary risk factor, although our trial was
not powered to investigate this difference. Strengths of this trial are the low cost of the interven-
tion and ease of administration of the gel, with potential for positive impact on neonatal health
globally.
This trial was designed as a dose-findingtrial, with the most effective dose in prevention of
hypoglycaemia to be used to inform a subsequent multicentre trial to determine the effect on
admission to NICU and on important long-term neurodevelopmental outcomes. Since efficacy
of dextrose gel in prevention of hypoglycaemia was similar in all dosage groups, but limitations
were more common in babies randomised to multiple doses, we have selected 0.5 ml/kg as the
dose to be used in our ongoing trial of dextrose gel prophylaxis (Hypoglycaemia Prevention
with Oral Dextrose [hPOD], ACTRN12614001263684) [23]. This also has the advantage of
being the same as the dose shown to be effective and safe in treatment of neonatal hypoglycae-
mia [6], thus minimising any risk of confusion between prophylaxis and treatment in prescrip-
tion and administration of gel in a clinical setting.
We have shown that in term and late preterm babies at risk of neonatal hypoglycaemia but
without indication for NICU admission, the incidence of hypoglycaemia can be reduced by a
single prophylactic buccal dose of 0.5 ml/kg 40% dextrose gel at 1 h of age, with an average of
ten babies needing treatment to prevent one baby developing hypoglycaemia. It remains to be
determined if this will result in other clinically important benefits in the short term and any
effects on long-term health.
