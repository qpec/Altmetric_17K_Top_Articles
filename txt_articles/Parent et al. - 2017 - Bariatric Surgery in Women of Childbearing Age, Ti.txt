IMPORTANCE Metabolic changes after maternal bariatric surgery may affect subsequent fetal
development. Many relevant perinatal outcomes have not been studied in this postoperative
population, and the risks associated with short operation-to-birth (OTB) intervals have not
been well examined.
OBJECTIVE To examine the risk for perinatal complications in women with a history of
bariatric surgery (postoperative mothers [POMs]) by comparing them with mothers without
operations (nonoperative mothers [NOMs]) and examining the association of the OTB
interval with perinatal outcomes.
DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS This investigation was a population-based retrospective
cohort study (January 1, 1980, to May 30, 2013) at hospitals in Washington State. Data were
collected from birth certificates and maternally linked hospital discharge data. Participants
were all POMs and their infants (n = 1859) and a population-based random sample of NOMs
and their infants frequency matched by delivery year (n = 8437).
EXPOSURES Bariatric operation before birth or categories of OTB intervals.
MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES The primary outcomes were prematurity, neonatal
intensive care unit (NICU) admission, congenital malformation, small for gestational age
(SGA), birth injury, low Apgar score (�8), and neonatal mortality. Poisson regression was
used to compute relative risks (RRs) and 95% CIs, with adjustments for maternal body mass
index, delivery year, socioeconomic status, age, parity, and comorbid conditions.
RESULTS A total of 10 296 individuals were included in the analyses for this study. In the
overall cohort, the median age was 29 years (interquartile range, 24-33 years). Compared
with infants from NOMS, infants from POMs had a higher risk for prematurity (14.0% vs 8.6%;
RR, 1.57; 95% CI, 1.33-1.85), NICU admission (15.2% vs 11.3%; RR, 1.25; 95% CI, 1.08-1.44), SGA
status (13.0% vs 8.9%; RR, 1.93; 95% CI, 1.65-2.26), and low Apgar score (17.5% vs 14.8%; RR,
1.21; 95% CI, 1.06-1.37). Compared with infants from mothers with greater than a 4-year OTB
interval, infants from mothers with less than a 2-year interval had higher risks for prematurity
(11.8% vs 17.2%; RR, 1.48; 95% CI, 1.00-2.19), NICU admission (12.1% vs 17.7%; RR, 1.54; 95%
CI, 1.05-2.25), and SGA status (9.2% vs 12.7%; RR, 1.51; 95% CI, 0.94-2.42).
CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE Infants of mothers with a previous bariatric operation had a
greater likelihood of perinatal complications compared with infants of NOMs.
Operation-to-birth intervals of less than 2 years were associated with higher risks for
prematurity, NICU admission, and SGA status compared with longer intervals. These findings
are relevant to women with a history of bariatric surgery and could inform decisions regarding
the optimal timing between an operation and conception.

B
ariatric operations may be considered for individuals
with a body mass index (BMI [calculated as weight in
kilograms divided by height in meters squared]) of 40
or higher or a BMI of 35 or higher with obesity-related
comorbidities.1,2 These surgical procedures result in restric-
tion of stomach size (banded gastroplasty, adjustable gastric
banding,andsleevegastrectomy)orrestrictionofstomachsize
with altered absorption of nutrients (Roux-en-Y gastric
bypass).1 After an operation, patients experience a mean post-
operative weight loss of approximately 30% and often have
resolutionofobesity-relatedcomorbidities,withreportedlong-
term effectiveness lasting 10 years and beyond.1,3,4
IntheUnitedStates,approximatelyone-fifthofwomenare
obese at the time of conception.3 Obesity during pregnancy is
associated with significant morbidity, including fetal macro-
somia,hypertensivedisorders,andgestationaldiabetes.3,4Sev-
eral observational studies3,5,6 have shown that bariatric op-
erations before pregnancy are associated with a reduced
prevalence of macrosomic infants, maternal diabetes, and hy-
pertension relative to the prevalence found among obese
women who did not undergo a bariatric operation. However,
to our knowledge, several other relevant indicators of perina-
tal health in this population have not been fully explored in
the published literature. In particular, because bariatric op-
erations can result in nutritional deficiencies in the mother,7
there has been some concern that surgery may adversely in-
fluence fetal development and infant outcomes.5,6,8 Out-
comes, such as neonatal intensive care unit (NICU) admis-
sions, Apgar scores,9 and congenital malformations, are likely
to be affected by maternal metabolic and nutritional
derangements.3 Although some preliminary studies10-14 have
investigated these outcomes, conclusions are conflicting and
limited by small sample sizes.
In addition, a “safe” interval between bariatric surgery and
childbirth remains undefined. The year after a bariatric op-
eration is characterized by rapid weight loss and a higher risk
for nutritional deficiencies, which may be a poor environ-
ment for fetal development.15 The American College of Gyne-
cologists recommends avoiding pregnancy for a minimum of
2 years after a bariatric operation, but this recommendation
is based largely on expert opinion rather than on robust
evidence.3,16,17Furtherstudiesareneededtodeterminethesaf-
est operation-to-birth (OTB) interval and to assess the influ-
ence this interval has on perinatal outcomes.
Inthisretrospectivecohortstudy,ouroverallobjectivewas
to inform women with a history of bariatric surgery about their
altered likelihood of perinatal complications. Herein, we de-
scribetheassociationofbariatricsurgerywithsubsequentperi-
natal outcomes and examine the association of the OTB inter-
val with perinatal risks.
Methods
Study Design, Participants, Setting, and Data Collection
Data from Washington State birth certificates (January 1, 1980,
to May 30, 2013) were linked to longitudinal maternal dis-
charge data on prior hospitalizations using the Comprehen-
sive Hospital Abstract Reporting System (CHARS), as de-
scribed in previous work.18 All data related to key exposure
variables, outcomes, and covariates were collected from these
sources. Most variables were recorded independently in both
birth certificate data sets and the CHARS data set, which en-
abled cross-checking and verification.
All mothers with a delivery year from January 1, 1980,
throughMay30,2013,inWashingtonStatewerescreenedforpo-
tentialinclusioninthisretrospectivecohortstudy(Figure1).All
motherswithahistoryofabariatricoperationatanytimebefore

operativemothers(POMs).Inaddition,apopulation-basedran-
domsampleofWashingtonStatemothersandtheirinfantswas
includedforpurposesofcomparisonandwasfrequencymatched
by infant delivery year in an approximately 4:1 ratio. The com-
parison group, referred to herein as nonoperative mothers
(NOMs), did not have a prior bariatric operation.
The conduct of this study was approved by the Washing-
ton State Department of Health Institutional Review Board. It
was determined to be exempt from informed consent be-
cause of the deidentified nature of the data.
Exposures and Outcomes
The primary exposure of interest was a history of a bariatric
operation at any time before conception; this aggregate cat-
egoricalexposureincludedbandedgastroplasty,adjustablegas-
tric banding, sleeve gastrectomy, or Roux-en-Y gastric by-
pass,asdefinedbyInternationalClassificationofDiseases,Ninth
Revision (ICD-9) codes V45.86 and 649.2. These codes were as-
signed during prior hospitalizations (CHARS-linked data) or
were assigned at the time of birth (birth certificate data). Ex-
posure definition using ICD-9 codes for bariatric surgery has
been used in previous cohort studies.19,20 The secondary ex-
posure of interest among POMs was the OTB interval (<2 years,
2-4 years or >4 years), with the shortest time defined by ex-
pert guidelines as the minimum safe interval.17
Primary outcomes were related to neonatal complica-
tions. These variables included the following: (1) prematurity,
defined by a “late preterm” category (gestational age, <37
weeks) and an “early preterm” category (gestational age, <32
weeks); (2) NICU admission, defined as any infant admission
Key Points
Question In women of childbearing age, is a prior bariatric
operation associated with risks for perinatal complications, and
does the time between an operation and birth alter these risks?
Findings In this cohort study, mothers with prior bariatric surgery
had infants with significantly higher risks for prematurity,
small-for-gestational-age status, and intensive care unit admission.
Operation-to-birth intervals of less than 2 years were associated
with the highest risks for prematurity and intensive care unit
admission.
Meaning Bariatric operations in women of childbearing age are
associated with elevated risks for subsequent perinatal
complications, but some of these risks may decrease after
postoperative year 2.

to the NICU at any point during the birth hospitalization; (3)
congenital malformation, defined as any malformation diag-
nosis coded on the birth certificate or any infant with dis-
charge diagnosis ICD-9 codes from 740 to 756 (predomi-
nantly heritable or chromosomal abnormalities [eg, Down
syndrome and other abnormal karyotypes] were excluded
from the malformation definition because their etiology is
thought to be independent of the maternal metabolic and
nutritional environment); (4) small for gestational age (SGA)
or large for gestational age (LGA), defined as the lowest 10%
and highest 10% of birth weights, based on Washington
State population data from 1989 to 2002, as previously
described21; (5) Apgar scores, which constitute a combined
measure of neonatal activity and vital signs and are deter-
mined by the obstetrician 5 minutes after birth9; (6) birth
injury, defined as any injury occurring during labor and deliv-
ery with ICD-9 code 767, including shoulder dystocia, intra-
ventricular hemorrhage, nerve palsy, scalp hematoma, and
skeletal trauma; and (7) fetal or infant mortality, defined as
any stillbirth or infant death during the birth hospitalization.
Secondary outcomes were related to labor and delivery
complications. These variables included the following: (1)
cesarean section, defined as any abdominal operation
(planned or unplanned) that results in the delivery of the
infant; (2) fetal distress in labor, defined by an obstetrician’
s
interpretation of fetal heart rate monitoring, as has been pre-
viously described22; (3) operative vaginal delivery, defined
as any vaginal delivery requiring forceps or vacuum assist;
and (4) precipitous or prolonged labor, defined as less than 3
hours or more than 20 hours for primigravid women and
more than 14 hours for multiparous women, respectively.23
Statistical Analysis and Data Presentation

Poisson regression with robust SEs was used to calculate
the relative risk (RR) for each outcome listed above. The
independent variable for all models was exposure to bariat-
ric surgery before the index birth. Categorical variables for
the mother’
s age, race/ethnicity, educational level, parity,
and annual household income were included in these mod-
els as potential confounders because these factors are
known to be associated with the exposure of interest (bariat-
ric surgery)24 and with neonatal outcomes.25,26 The match-
ing variable (infant delivery year) was also included in all
models.

pathway).3-5 Additional Poisson regression models included all
previouslylistedcovariatesandwerealsoadjustedformaternal

apart from its influence on these factors.

the OTB interval (defined as <2 years, 2-4 years, or >4 years).17
Covariates included in these models were all those previously
listed except for maternal hypertension and diabetes.
Body mass index data were missing in 24.9% of NOMs and
24.7% of POMs. Therefore, multiple imputation with chained
equations was used. All other variables analyzed had less than
5% missing data.
Given an α level of .05, a power of 80%, and this sample
size, the minimum detectable RRs for the main outcomes were
calculated to be 1.21 for prematurity, 1.20 for NICU admis-
sion, and 1.69 for congenital malformation. All analyses were
performed using Stata (version 12.1; StataCorp LP), the R soft-
ware environment (version 3.2.3; The R Foundation), and
GraphPad Prism (version 6.0; GraphPad Software, Inc).
Results
In Washington State from 1980 to 2013, there were 2 679 082
births, 1859 of which were from mothers who had a history of
a bariatric operation (POMs). The annual proportion of births
from POMs in Washington State has increased substantially
since 2000 (Figure 2A).
A total of 10 296 individuals were included in the analy-
ses for this study. All 1859 POMs and their infants were en-
rolled, along with a random population-based sample of 8437
NOMs and their infants. In the overall cohort, the median age
was 29 years (IQR, 24-33 years) and the median BMI was 26
(IQR, 22-31). Among POMs, the median OTB interval was 30
months(IQR,17-52months)(Figure2B).ComparedwithNOMs,
POMs were generally older, had a higher annual household in-
come, and were more likely to be of white race. The median
BMI among NOMs was 24.7 (IQR, 21.8-28.9), and the median
BMI among POMs was 31.2 (IQR, 27.0-37.0) (Table 1).
Higher Risks for Complications in Infants From Mothers
Who Underwent Bariatric Surgery
Relative to NOMs, POMs of similar age, BMI, parity, socioeco-
nomic status, and comorbid conditions had generally worse
perinatal outcomes. More specifically, 8.6% of infants from
NOMs were premature (gestational age, <37 weeks) com-
pared with 14% of infants from POMs (RR, 1.57; 95% CI, 1.33-
1.85). Early preterm births (gestational age, <32 weeks) oc-
curred in 1.5% of NOMs and 3.0% of POMs (RR, 1.71; 95% CI,
1.16-2.01). Eleven percent of infants from NOMs required NICU
admission compared with 15.2% of infants from POMs (RR,
1.25; 95% CI, 1.08-1.44). Relative to infants from NOMs, in-
fants from POMs were also at higher risk for SGA status (13.0%
vs 8.9%; RR, 1.93; 95% CI, 1.65-2.26) and low Apgar score of 8
orless(17.5%vs14.8%;RR,1.21;95%CI,1.06-1.37).Infantsfrom
POMS had trended toward higher risks for congenital malfor-
mations and mortality but had lower risk for LGA status (8.7%
vs 6.6%; RR, 0.53; 95% CI, 0.44-0.65). Moreover, 40.7% of
POMs underwent cesarean section compared with 25.4% of
NOMs (RR, 1.21; 95% CI, 1.12-1.31) (Table 2 and Figure 3A and
B).AlternativeanalyseswithoutadjustmentsformaternalBMI,
hypertension, and diabetes (Table 2) resulted in risk esti-
mates that were not meaningfully different.

RR, 1.51; 95% CI, 0.94-2.42) (eTable 1 in the Supplement and
Figure 3C). Infants of mothers with less than 2-year and 2- to
4-year OTB intervals had similar risks for SGA status relative
to infants of mothers with greater than a 4-year interval (RR,
1.51; 95% CI, 0.94-2.42 and RR, 1.67; 95% CI, 1.04-2.68, re-
spectively). Infants of POMs with a 2- to 4-year OTB interval
had prevalences of prematurity and NICU admission that were
not meaningfully different from the population-based ran-
dom sample of other infants. Moreover, infants of POMs with
greater than a 4-year OTB interval had a prevalence of SGA sta-
tus that was not meaningfully different from the population-
based sample of infants.
No other outcomes showed an association of appreciable
magnitude with the OTB interval. These results are summa-
rized in eTable 2 in the Supplement.
Discussion
Compared with a large population-based random sample of in-
fantsfromWashingtonState,infantsfrommotherswithpriorbar-
iatric operations (POMs) were at a higher risk for prematurity,
NICUadmission,SGAstatus,andlowApgarscore.Moreover,rela-
tive to infants from NOMs, infants from POMs tended to have
morecongenitalmalformations.Infantsofmotherswhohadan
OTB interval of less than 2 years demonstrated higher risks for
complications compared with those who had longer intervals.

erallyhigherforPOMsrelativetomothersofsimilarage,prepreg-
nancyBMI,parity,socioeconomicstatus,andcomorbidity.These

Prior analyses of perinatal outcomes in mothers with a his-
toryofbariatricsurgeryhaveoftenfailedtoaccountforBMIand

Undoubtedly, bariatric operations result in many health
benefits for morbidly obese women of childbearing age4 and
reduce obesity-related obstetrical complications.17,27 Find-
ings from this study should not deter bariatric surgeons from
offering such therapy to this population. Although we found

evidence for some increased perinatal complications among
POMs, our results indicate that these risks attenuate over time
and approach the baseline population risk within 2 to 3 years.
In other words, after 2 to 3 years, mothers appear to reap the
benefitsofaweightlossoperationwithoutincreasingfetalrisk.
ExpertconsensusfromtheAmericanCollegeofObstetricians
andGynecologists17haspreviouslyrecommendedavoidingpreg-
nancy for a minimum of 2 years after a bariatric operation. The
first 12 to 16 months after surgery are a time of rapid weight loss
and metabolic changes that can potentially result in nutritional
deficiencies.3,7 Conception during this period may expose a fe-
tustosuboptimalconditionsfordevelopment.Placentaldevel-
opment, fetal well-being, and long-term infant outcomes have
been linked with the metabolic and nutritional status of the
mother.28,29 Therefore, it is biologically plausible that underly-
ing maternal nutritional deficits after a bariatric operation cre-
ateapoorenvironmentforadevelopingfetusandcouldadversely
affectneonataloutcomes.Datafromthisstudyindicatethatthese
adverse effects may persist up to 3 years after a bariatric opera-
tionandsuggestthattheminimumrecommendedsafeinterval
should perhaps be extended to 3 years after surgery.
Some prior studies15,30 have evaluated OTB intervals and
foundnosignificantdifferencesinperinatalrisks.However,many
investigationsarelimitedbysmallsamplesizesandfailtoevalu-
ate several relevant outcomes. To our knowledge, only 1 other
adequatelypoweredpopulation-basedcohortstudy27hasevalu-
atedthetimingofsurgeryinrelationtobirth.Inthatstudy,Roos
etal27enrolled2562POMsfrom1980to2009inSweden.Aspart
ofasubanalysis,theauthorsevaluatedOTBintervalsandfound
increased risks for prematurity and SGA status for all intervals
up to 5 years. However, their use of logistic regression for com-
monoutcomeslikelyledtooverstatedriskestimates,31andonly
2 outcomes were evaluated. Our study evaluated a more com-
prehensivelistofrelevantoutcomesandusedPoissonregression
with robust SEs, which is more suitable to directly estimate RR
in the context of common outcomes.
Bariatricoperationsmaybeassociatedwithfewerlaborand
delivery complications, presumably due to weight loss, less
anatomic constraints, and reduced fetal macrosomia.5,8 Our
study found that POMs have lower risks for macrosomic in-
fants and prolonged labor compared with NOMs. Taken to-
gether, these findings suggest that bariatric operations con-
fer some advantages during labor and delivery. However, this
conclusion is tentative at best because there were more cesar-
ean sections in POMs compared with NOMs.
Severallimitationsareimportanttoconsiderwheninterpret-
ingourresults.First,ourdatabasedidnotcontaindetailsonsub-
types of bariatric operations, and all were combined into an

erations create widely different effects on physiology, metabo-
lism,nutrition,andhormonalbalance.4Itislikelythatdifferences
inneonataloutcomeswilldepend,inpart,onwhichtypeofbar-
iatric operation the mother had.32 Nevertheless, previous
studies3,10,13,14haveusedasimilaraggregateapproach,andvalu-

14.3% of births from POMs occurred before 2000, and 52.0%
occurred after 2008, making this study group a fairly contem-
porary cohort. Third, one could posit that adjustment for BMI

mothers who had less than a 2-year OTB interval demonstrated
higherrisksforprematurityandNICUadmissioncomparedwith
those who had longer intervals. Moreover, an elevated risk for
SGA status may persist up to 3 years after a bariatric operation.

Invited Commentary
Corrected vs Uncorrected Obesity in Childbearing Women—
What Really Drives Fetal Risks?
Aaron J. Dawes, MD, PhD; Danielle M. Dawes, RN, WHNP-BC; Melinda Maggard-Gibbons, MD, MSHS
Bariatric surgery has helped to improve the health and quality
of life of thousands of morbidly obese Americans. Yet, despite
a notable short-term safety profile, several questions have
recently been raised about its long-term physiological and psy-
chosocial effects. Suicide, for example, may be more common
afterbariatricsurgerythanbefore,inspiteofapparentimprove-
ments in patients’underlying
depression.1 In this issue of
JAMA Surgery, Parent and
colleagues2 add to this debate
by suggesting that women who undergo bariatric surgery may
be at higher risk for certain perinatal complications, especially
iftheygetpregnantwithin2yearsoftheiroperation.Whilethese
findingsarecompelling,additionalquestionsmustbeanswered
before they can be used to guide patient care.
First, is this link a causal one? Multiple pathways can be
drawn between bariatric surgery and delivering a neonate who
ispreterm,smallforgestationalage,orinneedofintensivecare.
Surgically induced nutritional deficits—the primary mecha-
nism suggested by the authors—is plausible: bariatric surgery
has been linked to iron deficiency anemia,3 a known risk fac-
tor for low birth weight, abnormal fetal oxygenation, and peri-
natal mortality.4 However, other potential mechanisms must
be explored. For example, patients who are obese are more
likely to require preterm delivery for maternal or fetal
indications,5 a fact that must be accounted for when compar-
ingraw(ie,notgestationalageadjusted)birthweights.Astron-
ger argument for nutritional causes could have been made if
Parent and colleagues2 had stratified postoperative mothers
by the type of procedure they received. If malnutrition is, in
fact, responsible, then one would expect to see higher rates
of perinatal complications among women who underwent gas-
tric bypass (in part a malabsorptive procedure) than among
those who underwent gastric banding (primarily a restrictive
one). In addition, measuring actual nutritional parameters (eg,
vitaminB12levels)orratesofmaternalanemiawouldhavebeen
informative.
Second, and perhaps most important, are we making the
right comparison? Even if obese women who undergo bariat-
ric surgery are at higher risk for perinatal complications than
a random sample of mostly white, educated, and normal-
weight Washingtonians, are they at lower or higher risk than
they would have been without the operation? Obesity—along
with its associated comorbid health conditions—has itself been
repeatedly linked to multiple perinatal complications, includ-
ing preeclampsia, placental abruption, congenital anomalies,
miscarriage, and stillbirth.3
Although many of these risks may decline as patients lose
their excess weight, others may endure. Therefore, it is diffi-
cult to know if the apparent increase in perinatal complica-
tions that Parent and colleagues2 found is due to the persis-
tenteffectsofobesityortotheoperationmeanttocorrectthem,
especiallyconsideringthatthemajorityofpostoperativemoth-
ers in the current study remained obese.
