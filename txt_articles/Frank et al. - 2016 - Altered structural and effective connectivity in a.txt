Altered structural and effective connectivity in anorexia and
bulimia nervosa in circuits that regulate energy and reward
homeostasis
GKW Frank1,2, ME Shott1, J Riederer1 and TL Pryor3
Anorexia and bulimia nervosa are severe eating disorders that share many behaviors. Structural and functional brain circuits could
provide biological links that those disorders have in common. We recruited 77 young adult women, 26 healthy controls, 26 women
with anorexia and 25 women with bulimia nervosa. Probabilistic tractography was used to map white matter connectivity strength
across taste and food intake regulating brain circuits. An independent multisample greedy equivalence search algorithm tested
effective connectivity between those regions during sucrose tasting. Anorexia and bulimia nervosa had greater structural
connectivity in pathways between insula, orbitofrontal cortex and ventral striatum, but lower connectivity from orbitofrontal cortex
and amygdala to the hypothalamus (Po0.05, corrected for comorbidity, medication and multiple comparisons). Functionally, in
controls the hypothalamus drove ventral striatal activity, but in anorexia and bulimia nervosa effective connectivity was directed
from anterior cingulate via ventral striatum to the hypothalamus. Across all groups, sweetness perception was predicted by
connectivity strength in pathways connecting to the middle orbitofrontal cortex. This study provides evidence that white matter
structural as well as effective connectivity within the energy-homeostasis and food reward-regulating circuitry is fundamentally
different in anorexia and bulimia nervosa compared with that in controls. In eating disorders, anterior cingulate cognitive–
emotional top down control could affect food reward and eating drive, override hypothalamic inputs to the ventral striatum and
enable prolonged food restriction.

INTRODUCTION
Anorexia and bulimia nervosa are severe psychiatric disorders with
high mortality.1 Although anorexia nervosa is mainly characterized
by severe underweight and bulimia nervosa individuals are at
normal to high weight and regularly binge and purge,2 there are
many overlapping symptoms, such as food restriction, excessive
exercise, altered interoceptive perception including hunger and
appetite3 as well drive for thinness and body dissatisfaction.
Anorexia and bulimia nervosa aggregate in families, and shared
biological underpinnings have been hypothesized.4 The brain
circuitry of food intake regulation depends on the interaction of
the hypothalamus, which has a central role in energy homeostasis,
with brain regions such as prefrontal and orbitofrontal cortex
(OFC), insula, midbrain and ventral striatum, a brain circuitry that
integrates taste perception, food reward value and cognitive–
emotional associations with food.5 Alterations in those circuits in
both disorders could point toward shared vulnerabilities.
Brain research in eating disorders has started to shed light on
how altered brain structure or function may be common to anorexia
and bulimia nervosa. Positron emission tomography studies
suggested in both disorders increased serotonin 1A as well as
cannabinoid type 1 receptors,6,7 neurotransmitter receptors asso-
ciated with food intake modulation and sweet taste perception.8–10
Structural brain imaging studies have been inconsistent. One study
that directly compared the two disorders in a nutritionally highly
controlled environment found larger OFC volumes in anorexia and
bulimia nervosa11—a brain region that processes food pleasant-
ness
and
regulates
food
intake.12
Others
found
increased
somatosensory cortex volumes in both disorders.13 Functional
magnetic resonance brain imaging (fMRI) indicated greater insula
activation to food images,14 as well as higher resting-state
synchrony between anterior cingulate cortex and precuneus,15
although other studies found opposite brain activation in
response to visual food cues16 or sweet taste stimulation.17–19
Studies that focused on brain white matter found reduced white
matter integrity (fractional anisotropy, FA) in anorexia and bulimia
nervosa within the fornix.20–22
Research has helped to better understand how brain networks
are structurally or functionally connected.23 One method is to
investigate how strongly white matter tracts connect those brain
regions, expressed as streamlines as an indicator of fiber
amount.24 Another method is to investigate how brain regions
functionally interact; this so-called dynamic causal or effective
connectivity provides indication that brain region drives activation
in another.25,26 A few studies exist in eating disorders that have
investigated effective connectivity, but not with respect to taste
processing, which is the focus of our work. One study using
resting-state data and Granger causality found that individuals

 with anorexia nervosa had higher effective connectivity from
medial OFC and insula to inferior frontal gyrus, but lower effective
connectivity from the frontal gyrus to the cingulate cortex.27 One
small study suggested connectivity differences between anorexia
nervosa and control groups between medial occipital cortex,
extrastriate and fusiform body areas in response to viewing
pictures of bodies or chairs.28 A study where individuals with
anorexia, bulimia nervosa and controls viewed images of food and
non-food items found no effective connectivity differences
between insula, orbitofrontal and frontal cortex between anorexia
nervosa and controls, but the bulimia nervosa group did not have
connectivity between left insula and right frontal cortex that the
other
study
groups
had.14
A
very
recent
report
studied
connectivity between the nucleus accumbens and the OFC using
resting-state images in anorexia nervosa at two time points,
before and after weight restoration.29 There the anorexia nervosa
group showed an effective connectivity direction from the OFC to
the nucleus accumbens, as well as greater anatomical connectivity
strength using probabilistic tractography between the two regions
of interest. One study from our group in individuals long-term
recovered from anorexia nervosa found greater white matter
connectivity strength from the insula to ventral striatum and
OFC.30 Interestingly, duration of illness positively predicted
connectivity strength of those tracts, suggesting a process
compensating for effects from the illness and maybe affecting
food reward-circuit function. In summary, few studies are available
on effective or structural connectivity in eating disorders, and the
varying methods and results do not provide a uniform model of
brain function. One question that has to be raised in this context is
what type of task is most suitable to elicit effective connectivity.
We chose taste processing because we have a good under-
standing of the taste and taste-reward circuitry in the brain. Here
we wanted to study this circuitry across multiple regions for a
comprehensive
assessment
of
structural
and
effective
connectivity.
In this study we used a multimodal imaging approach to test
the hypothesis that individuals ill with anorexia and bulimia
nervosa have greater white matter connectivity across the energy
homeostasis and cognitive-emotional reward circuitry. Further-
more, we wanted to study how regional activation during taste of
sucrose solution is coupled, that is, what the pattern of effective
connectivity or neural information flow is within this circuitry. We
expected that we would find in the eating-disorder groups'
indication that cognitive control regions would influence sub-
cortical appetite and taste reward function, suggesting a top–
down control mechanism.31 In contrast, we expected that in
controls hypothalamic signals would rather influence reward
system
activation,

information to drive the food approach.32
MATERIALS AND METHODS
Participants
Twenty-six women with restricting-type anorexia nervosa, 25 with bulimia
nervosa, as well as 26 healthy comparison women participated in the
study. The sample size was based on our previous study that indicated
adequate power for this type of study and analysis.30 Participants in the
eating-disorder groups were recruited from Children’s Hospital Colorado or
Eating Disorders Center Denver. Eating disorder subjects were within
1–2 weeks of program-prescribed food intake to avoid acute effects of
starvation and dehydration. Healthy comparison women were recruited
through local advertisements. The Structured Clinical Interview for
Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, 4th Edition diagnoses
was administered by a doctoral-level interviewer. All participants were
right-handed, without history of head trauma, neurological disease, major
medical illness, psychosis or substance-use disorders. The study was
approved by the Colorado Multiple Institutional Review Board, and all
participants provided written informed consent.
Behavior assessments
Study participants completed the Eating Disorder Inventory-3 (EDI-3),33
Temperament and Character Inventory (TCI),34 Spielberger State and Trait
Anxiety Inventory (STAI),35 Beck Depression Inventory (BDI)36 and Revised
Sensitivity to Punishment and Reward Questionnaire (SPSRQ).37 Before
brain-imaging subjects rated sucrose sweetness on a 9-point likert scale,
1 = dislike very much to 9 = like very much.
Brain imaging procedures
Before brain imaging between 0800 and 0900 hours, eating-disorder
individuals ate their meal plan breakfast; controls had a breakfast matched
in quality and calories to the average meal plan breakfast. Brain images
were acquired on a GE Signa 3T scanner: (1) diffusion-weighted imaging
(DWI) included 25 DWI diffusion directions and one T2-weighted (b = 0)
baseline image; 45 slices per image in anterior–posterior commissure
orientation (128x128 matrix, repetition time (TR)/echo time (TE) = 16 000-
/82.6 ms, field of view = 26 cm, b-value = 1000, ASSET, slice thickness/
gap = 2.6/0 mm). (2) fMRI T2* weighted echo-planar imaging for blood

fMRI task
We adapted the design used by O’Doherty et al.38 Individuals received
three taste stimuli during fMRI imaging: 1 mol l − 1 sucrose solution (100
trials), no solution (100 trials) and artificial saliva (80 trials). Individuals
learned to associate each unconditioned taste stimulus (US) with a paired
conditioned visual stimulus (CS) that is probabilistically associated with its
US: the CS shape for sucrose was followed in 80% of trials by sucrose
solution (the other 20% were followed by no solution), and the CS shape
associated with no-solution (null) was followed in 80% of the trials by no
solution (the other 20% were followed by sucrose); the CS shape for
artificial saliva was always followed by saliva receipt. For each subject, the
first 10 trials were fixed CS shape for sucrose followed by the delivery of US
sucrose to establish an initial stable association between the CS sucrose
shape and US sucrose taste.38 All other trials were fully randomized
without predetermined order. The taste stimuli were applied using a
customized-programmable syringe pump (J-Kem Scientific, St Louis, MO,
USA) controlled with the E-Prime Software (Psychological Software Tools,
Pittsburgh, PA, USA). Individual taste application was triggered by

duration was 28 min.
Diffusion image analysis
Diffusion weighted images were processed using FSL’s Diffusion Toolbox
4.1.3 (FDT, Oxford Centre for Functional MRI of the Brain, http://www.fmrib.
ox.ac.uk/fsl). Images were corrected for eddy current distortions and head
motion. Probabilistic fiber tractography was computed for each subject
using
PROBTRACKX2
to
generate
the
most
probable
connectivity
distribution between seed and ipsilateral target. Tractography parameters
were as follows: 5000 sample tracts per seed voxel, 0.2 curvature threshold,
step length of 0.5 and a maximum number of steps 2000. Connectivity was
assessed by computing connection strength that determines the mean
probability
of
streamlines
for
each
seed–target
combination.
The
calculated connection strength value was divided by the total connection
probability of seed regions and then multiplied by the mean connection
probability across seed and target regions and finally divided by the target
volume of interest in order to normalize and rescale the results for size of
seed and target regions.39 Physical path length was also corrected for.39 In
each hemisphere, tract-based connection strength was calculated for
anatomical white matter tracts connecting regions of a comprehensive
taste reward hierarchy proposed by Rolls et al.40 (Supplementary Figure 1).
Seed regions included the thalamus, dorsal anterior insula, ventral anterior
insula, posterior insula, substantia nigra, central nucleus of the amygdala,
basolateral amygdala, medial OFC, middle OFC, gyrus rectus and inferior
OFC. Thalamus targets included all subregions of the insula and the frontal
operculum.

amygdala, the targets were the hypothalamus, substantia nigra, ventral

 striatum and the anterior cingulate cortex. OFC subregion targets included
the hypothalamus, ventral striatum and the medial PFC. In total, tract-
based connection strength was calculated for 98 white matter tracts
connecting aforementioned seed and ipsilateral targets. The Automated
Anatomical Labeling atlas was used to determine coordinates for each
seed and target region.41
fMRI analysis
Brain-imaging data were preprocessed and analyzed using the SPM8
software in Matlab R2009b, 7.9.0 (MathWorks, Natick, MA, USA). Data from
each subject were realigned to the first volume, normalized to the
Montreal Neurological Institute template and smoothed with a 6-mm full
width at half maximum Gaussian kernel. Each image sequence was
manually inspected, and images with artifacts or movement more than
one voxel size were removed.
Data were modeled with a hemodynamic response function—con-
volved boxcar function—using the general linear model, including
temporal and dispersion derivatives, and autoregression. A 128-s high-
pass filter was applied to remove low-frequency fluctuation in the BOLD
signal. Motion parameters were applied as regressors in the first-level
analysis to correct for individual movement. We then developed first-level
models in which we predicted the response in each voxel as a function of
each of the stimulus conditions. For this study we computed the contrast
for expected sucrose receipt versus expected receipt of no solution.
Effective connectivity
Within SPM8, we extracted functional time-series data for expected receipt
of 1 M sucrose solution for each of the seed and target regions of interest
using the SPM marsbar toolbox. Effective connectivity was inferred using
Independent Multiplesample Greedy Equivalence Search (IMaGES) and
Linear non-gaussian Orientation, Fixed Structure search algorithms housed
within the TETRAD V program.42 The goal of effective connectivity analyses
is to understand causal relations among the neuronal populations whose
activity gives rise to observed fMRI signals in spatially localized regions of
interest. The results from those analyses are presented as directed graphs,
where nodes or vertices in the graph represent brain regions and directed
edges in the graph represent relatively direct causal influences of one
region on another. The Independent Multiplesample Greedy Equivalence
Search (IMaGES) is a modification of the Greedy Equivalence Search (GES)
that allows to analyze multiple data sets. GES begins with an empty graph
whose vertices are the recorded variables and proceeds to search forward,
one new connection at a time, over Markov Equivalence classes of directed
acyclic graphs. Each class of models with an additional edge is scored
using the Bayes Information Criterion: − 2ln(ML) + k ln (n), where ML is the
maximum likelihood estimate, k is the dimension of the model (the
number of directed edges plus the number of variables) and n is the
sample size. The algorithm searches forward from the empty graph until
no improvement in the Bayes Information Criterion score is possible, and
then backward, and outputs a description of a Markov Equivalence class. In
practice, the algorithm requires a computation of a series of maximum
likelihood estimates, and is limited to cases where approximations to such
estimates can be rapidly obtained. The analysis process in IMaGES and GES
is nonlinear, and therefore a comparison of a parameterized output of the
GES using conventional linear models for group comparison is not
recommended. IMaGES was supplemented by a Linear non-gaussian
Orientation, Fixed Structure algorithm postprocessor; this leads to a
precision of orientations that is greater than 90% and the precision of
recall greater than 80%, that is, more edges are directed than with IMaGES
alone, and with no loss of accuracy.25
Statistical analyses
Demographic and behavioral data were analyzed using SPSS 23.0 (IBM-
SPSS, Chicago, IL, USA) using multivariate multivariate analyses of variance
(MANOVAs); extracted data for brain connectivity were in addition
corrected for medication use, anxiety and mood disorder diagnoses
(added factors in the model) and post hoc pairwise between group
analyses
were
Bonferroni-corrected.
In
addition,
we
analyzed
the
connectivity data with MANOVA without added factors as well as a non-
parametric Kruskal–Wallis test because not all data in each group were
normally distributed (Supplementary Table 2). Linear regression analyses to
test behavior–brain relationships were applied for age, body mass index
and 1 M sucrose ratings for pleasantness and sweetness; additional
exploratory analyses tested the potentially confounding effects of
depression or anxiety measures. Significant correlations were corrected
using the false discovery rate using the method proposed by Benjamini
and Hochberg.43
RESULTS
Demographics and assessment results
Groups were matched for age; anorexia nervosa subjects had
significantly (Table 1) lower body mass index compared with the
other study groups; harm avoidance, depression, drive for thinness,
body dissatisfaction, state and trait anxiety and sensitivity to
punishment were higher in both eating-disorder groups com-
pared with controls. Sensitivity to reward was greater compared
with controls only in the bulimia nervosa group, whereas novelty-
seeking was lower in the anorexia nervosa group.
White matter connectivity strength
Left:
white
matter
connection
strength
(Figure
1
and
Supplementary Table 1) was higher in both eating disorder groups
between insula regions and middle OFC, between ventral and
dorsal anterior insula to ventral striatum and dorsal anterior insula,
from posterior insula to medial PFC, and between inferior OFC and
gyrus rectus and ventral striatum. In anorexia and bulimia nervosa
groups, connectivity strength was lower between middle OFC and
hypothalamus, as well as between gyrus rectus and medial PFC. In
bulimia nervosa only, connectivity was lower compared with
controls from ventral anterior insula to inferior OFC and central
nucleus of the amygdala, and in anorexia nervosa between medial
OFC and hypothalamus.
Right: Connectivity strength was greater in both eating-disorder
groups in tracts from posterior insula and medial OFC to ventral
striatum and from dorsal anterior insula to the medial PFC.
Anorexia and bulimia nervosa groups showed less connectivity
between basolateral nucleus of the amygdala and hypothalamus;
anorexia nervosa had less connectivity between middle OFC and
hypothalamus, and bulimia nervosa from the amygdala basolat-
eral nucleus to the ventral striatum and dorsal anterior insula.
The additional analysis using MANOVA without comorbidity or
medication as factors, or the analysis using the non-parametric
test indicated that the MANOVA with added factors did not inflate
results (Supplementary Table 1).
Effective dynamic connectivity
There were bilateral effective connectivity patterns that all groups
(Figure 2 and Table 2) shared: on the left from insula regions to the
thalamus and ventral striatum, and on the right from the ventral
anterior insula to OFC as well as intra-insular and orbitofrontal
connections.
Only the controls had an effective connectivity pattern from the
hypothalamus to ventral striatum bilaterally. On the right side
both eating-disorder groups showed effective connectivity from
the anterior cingulate to ventral striatum, and from there to the
hypothalamus. Substantia nigra effectively connected to the
thalamus, whereas the opposite relationship was the case in
controls.
Unique to anorexia nervosa was left- and right-sided con-
nectivity driven by the frontal operculum to the anterior cingulate
cortex; the bulimia nervosa group showed a unique pattern of
dynamic connectivity from anterior cingulate to medial OFC. Both
anorexia and bulimia nervosa showed effective connectivity on
the left from ventral anterior insula to inferior OFC, middle to
inferior OFC and dorsal to ventral anterior insula.
Correlation analyses
Age, body mass index or pleasantness perception were not
significantly correlated with brain results in any group or pathway

 after false discovery rate correction. All groups showed positive
correlations
between sweetness

and
connection
strength in fibers that terminated in the middle OFC, although
right hemispheric in controls and left-sided in eating-disorder
groups (Table 3). In addition, in the anorexia nervosa group only,
there was a pattern of negative correlation for pathways between
thalamus, hypothalamus, insula and limbic brain regions. Duration
of illness was positively correlated with connection strength for

 five pathways in the eating-disorder groups, but none survived
false discovery rate correction.
To test for confounding variables, we tested whether group
differences in regional brain response to sucrose solution was
related to connection strength or effective connectivity. We
conducted an additional whole-brain contrast for expected
sucrose against no solution receipt. This analysis did not show
any group differences (Po0.001, 10 voxel cluster threshold). In
addition, we calculated FA for investigated fiber paths using
fslstats,30 and tested whether FA predicted group differences for
connectivity strength or effective connectivity. FA was lower
(Po0.05, corrected for multiple comparisons, comorbidity and
medication) in both anorexia and bulimia groups compared with
controls from left ventral anterior insula and gyrus rectus to
ventral striatum, left posterior insula to middle OFC and right
middle OFC to hypothalamus. In anorexia nervosa only, FA was
lower in connections from right central nucleus of amygdala to
hypothalamus, left dorsal anterior insula to ventral striatum, right
dorsal anterior insula to gyrus rectus, bilateral posterior insula to
ventral striatum, left medial OFC to hypothalamus, right medial
OFC to ventral striatum and left gyrus rectus to PFC. There were no
significant correlations between FA and structural connectivity,
and effective connectivity was not selectively altered in pathways
with lower FA.
DISCUSSION
The results of this study indicate that both anorexia and bulimia
nervosa are associated with widespread alterations in white
matter structural as well as effective connectivity in taste-reward
and appetite-regulating pathways. Structural connectivity was
greater in both eating-disorder groups between insula and orbito-
and PFC regions, whereas connection strength was lower in
pathways to the hypothalamus, a region central to feeding
regulation. Effective connectivity during sweet taste stimulation
differed between groups, including the anterior cingulate showing
effective connectivity to the ventral striatum, which modulated

Structural and effective connectivity in anorexia and bulimia
GKW Frank et al

Translational Psychiatry (2016), 1 – 10
 hypothalamus activity in anorexia and bulimia nervosa, whereas in
controls the hypothalamus was driving ventral striatal activity.
White matter structural connectivity was positively correlated with
sweet taste perception in all groups in pathways that terminated
in the middle OFC, but anorexia nervosa showed an additional
negative correlation with connectivity strength between thalamus,
hypothalamus and insula.
Human brain imaging research in anorexia and bulimia nervosa
has made progress over the past years and has repeatedly
implicated brain taste-reward and salience-processing regions in
the pathophysiology of those disorders. Whether there are
circuitry differences in structural white matter fiber connectivity
and thus organization, or whether the effective functional
interactions of those brain regions differ in eating disorders
compared with controls had not been studied. Here we wanted to
test whether greater structural white matter connectivity is a
common marker of white matter organization across taste- and
appetite-regulating pathways in eating disorders. Our results now
indicate that anorexia and bulimia nervosa during the ill state are
associated with bilaterally higher connectivity between insula,
frontal cortex and ventral striatum, but on the contrary with lower
connectivity between OFC and hypothalamus on the left, and
lower connectivity between basolateral nucleus of the amygdala
and hypothalamus on the right; anorexia nervosa showed lower
connectivity between OFC and hypothalamus pathways bilater-
ally. Those results suggest that taste-reward circuitry alterations in
eating disorder go beyond connections between insula, OFC and
ventral striatum and include the hypothalamus, a key structure in
appetite control.44 Animal studies have shown that the connec-
tions from the cortex and amygdala to the hypothalamus are
important for cue-mediated food intake, or how much an
individual eats after presentation of feeding-associated stimuli.45
Research on learning, operant conditioning and food avoidance in
eating disorders is sparse. Research has shown that humans are
‘innately’ programmed to like sweet tastes at birth.46,47 Individuals
with eating disorders typically start to avoid, for instance, eating
sweets because they are afraid of gaining weight. One could see
such avoidance as a form of learned behavior, and more
specifically operant conditioning, with weight gain as the feared
‘punishment’.48 Thus, altered functioning in frontohypothalamic
circuits could facilitate or inhibit operant conditioning or reversal
of such associations. Psychotherapy for meal support and
nutritional rehabilitation is designed to re-establish normal eating
patterns and tolerate the feared stimulus, food. However, whether
those processes indeed follow the principles of operant con-
ditioning has been insufficiently studied and deserves further
exploration. The reward-system crosstalk between hypothalamus,
striatum
and
amygdala
involves
neurotransmitters
such
as
dopamine, gamma-amino-butyric acid, glutamate and orexin,49
and animal models and neurotransmitter receptor studies will be
needed to further understand neurochemical alterations that
could alter neural transmission.
The combination of greater connectivity and lower FA is
striking. We have found a similar phenomenon in women
recovered from anorexia nervosa previously.30 FA is the scalar
composite of axial and radial diffusivity, giving information on
water diffusion across the various directions along paths. The
connectivity on the other hand is a probability measure for how
many fibers may connect a seed with a target region, without
emphasis on radial diffusivity. Thus, the connectivity is a reflection
of the number of connections that go from one point to another,
whereas the FA value is thought to represent the structural
integrity of those fibers. Previously, higher connectivity has been
described in, for instance, in dementia of the Alzheimer’s type, a
condition that is by the same time associated with lower FA.50 It is
possible that altered white matter connectivity is compensatory to
effects from the illness on white matter integrity. In our previous
study in anorexia nervosa after recovery, we found that longer
duration of illness predicted greater connectivity strength.30 In this
study we found some indication for a similar relationship, but less
strongly not surviving multiple comparison correction. This could
be due to the fact that subjects were still in the ill phase, and with
ongoing illness this relationship may strengthen. We are currently
recruiting subjects from this cohort when recovered in order to
shed further light on this question.
To the best of our knowledge, this is the first study that
provides evidence that structural white matter connectivity is
related to individual sweet-taste perception. In all three groups,
connectivity between middle OFC and insula was positively
correlated with subjective sweetness perception, although this
was found on the right in controls and in the eating-disorder
groups on the left. The mechanistic underpinnings for such a
relationship are elusive and require further study. In addition, in
anorexia nervosa, structural connectivity correlated negatively
with sweet perception between the ventromedial posterior
nucleus of the thalamus and the insula, as well as fiber paths
originating from the left amygdala and connections between left
posterior insula and gyrus rectus. The mean connection strength

Structural and effective connectivity in anorexia and bulimia

 between anorexia nervosa and controls between those regions
was not different, and the implications of this negative correlation
are speculative.
The effective conectivity, or dynamic causal mechanisms of
brain circuits' interaction during tasting sucrose solution showed
similarities but also fundamentally different patterns between
groups. All groups showed bilaterally effective connectivity from
insula regions to ventral striatum and OFC, as well as prefrontal—
OFC connectivity on the right side. We are not aware that this has
been studied previously in this manner in humans. Taste
information is thought to be transmitted via the thalamus to
insula/frontal operculum and from there to anterior cingulate,
ventral striatum, OFC and hypothalamus;51 however, new research
using salient stimuli suggests a greater complexity of those
pathways.52 One study suggested effective connectivity based on
attention to monosodium glutamate taste intensity (PFC to insula)
versus pleasantness (PFC to OFC).53 Our data now provide new
information how sweet taste may activate the taste-reward
system. In controls, bilaterally, the flux of activation was directed
from the hypothalamus to ventral striatum, suggesting that
hypothalamic signals have an important input on ventral striatal
activation and maybe motivation to approach food stimuli. In
contrast, in both anorexia and bulimia nervosa the right anterior
cingulate-effective connectivity was directed to the ventral
striatum, which in turn mediated hypothalamus activity. This
reversal of input may have key effects on appetite regulation in
eating disorders. Basic science suggests that hypothalamus–
ventral
striatum
connections
are
important
for
feeding
regulation.54 Our data suggest that in eating disorders there
may be a top–down control of this circuitry. The anterior cingulate
is important in error-monitoring and anxiety-processing,55 and
eating-related fearful cognitions could have an impact on
subcortical taste-reward processing, which in turn could alter
the normal hypothalamic feeding-drive input.
In anorexia nervosa, bilaterally effective connectivity was
directed from frontal operculum to the anterior cingulate, and
bulimia nervosa showed anterior cingulate-effective connectivity
to the medial OFC. Input from the frontal operculum to the
anterior cingulate could reinforce food avoidance behavior and
anterior cingulate–OFC-effective connectivity
could have an
impact on value computation of sweet taste perception or
hedonic experience in bulimia nervosa; however, testing this
hypothesis will require a specific study design.53
We did not see overlap between areas of altered group-
effective connectivity and structural connectivity strength. This
suggests that those results and potential function–behavior
implications are independent. On the other hand, altered white
matter connectivity strength could be compensatory and normal-
ize effective dynamic connectivity. White matter integrity was
lower in most pathways tested in the anorexia but only in few
white matter tracts in bulimia nervosa compared with controls.
One interpretation is that FA could be related to the severity of
malnutrition. This will need further study and across time from
illness through the recovery process.
Limitations
The sample size was modest and requires replication. However,
partial eta squared for connectivity strength between group
comparisons was 40.5, indicating large effect size. Probabilistic
tractography does not provide absolute fiber counts.24 Still, this
method does provide results comparable to direct white matter
neuron-tracing,56 suggesting that our results are valid. Utilizing 25
diffusion
directions
during
MRI
data
acquisition
may
limit
probabilistic tractography analysis; however, it has been shown
that increasing diffusion directions does not improve fiber-
tracking.57 The mechanism of greater white matter connectivity
in eating disorders is uncertain, but could be due to white matter
reorganization after tissue injury.50 Future studies will need to
further explore whether alterations found result from underweight
or are premorbid traits. The IMaGES algorithm used here may be
one of the most reliable tools available,42 but it cannot describe
whether the effective connectivity is increasing or decreasing
activity between connected regions. The effective connectivity
analysis found across-group connectivity in the same or opposite
direction, or effective connectivity between regions in one group
but not in another, and a limitation of the method is that direct
comparison of connectivity parameters across groups cannot
reliably be done based on those connectivity patterns. A limitation
of this study is the cross-sectional design, and we are currently
studying individuals with anorexia nervosa during recovery and
hope that this will help better describe potential underlying
mechanisms. This is a typical clinical eating-disorder sample with
typical comorbidity of anxiety and depressive disorders. In order
to control for those effects we included comorbidity (anxiety
disorder and major depressive disorder) and medication use
(selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor and antipsychotic) in
the statistical model as factors but we cannot entirely rule out
the impact of the comorbid conditions on the results. Anxiety and
depression ratings did not significantly correlate with connectivity
measures. In order to understand the mechanisms of connectivity
strength as well as effective connectivity, it will be important to
study those variables at different time points during disease and
recovery. Ideally, a longitudinal approach is chosen. One very
recent study exists that investigated effective connectivity and
connectivity strength before and after weight restoration. That
study included only one fiber path, the connection from the
nucleus accumbens to the OFC, which was increased at both time
points.29 Effective connectivity is an up to date less commonly
used technique. We still are just at the beginning of under-
standing how brain regions interact, and we cannot exclude that
effects from comorbid conditions had an impact on the effective
connectivity results. In depression, for instance, a study found
greater connectivity within the anterior cingulate cortex during a
cognitive task compared with controls.58 Another study reported
on lower prefrontal cortical–amygdala-effective connectivity in
response to negative emotional faces in women with postpartum
depression.
In
addition,
a
study
in
youth
indicated
that
adolescents with major depressive disorder had lower effective
connectivity from the amygdala to the anterior cingulate.59 In a
study in social anxiety disorder the individuals with anxiety
showed connectivity from the OFC to the amygdala, which was
not observed in controls.60 Because those studies did not use taste
stimuli or focused on, for instance, hypothalamus circuitry they are
not comparable with this study. However, a study in controls
showed that taste stimulation was related to effective connectivity
from the insular cortex to the thalamus, a direction that we
observed in our study subjects as well.61
CONCLUSION
This study suggests greater white matter connection strength
across frontostriatal reward pathways, but reduced connectivity
strength to the hypothalamus, which could have important
implications
on
appetite
regulation.
The
effective
network
connectivity from anterior cingulate to ventral striatum and to
the hypothalamus
in eating disorders
provides
a possible
biological correlate for the hypothesis that those individuals are
able to override homeostatic signals.
