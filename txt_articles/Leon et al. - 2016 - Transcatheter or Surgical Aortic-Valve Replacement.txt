BACKGROUND
Previous trials have shown that among high-risk patients with aortic stenosis, survival 
rates are similar with transcatheter aortic-valve replacement (TAVR) and surgical aortic-
valve replacement. We evaluated the two procedures in a randomized trial involving 
intermediate-risk patients.
METHODS
We randomly assigned 2032 intermediate-risk patients with severe aortic stenosis, at 57 
centers, to undergo either TAVR or surgical replacement. The primary end point was death 
from any cause or disabling stroke at 2 years. The primary hypothesis was that TAVR would 
not be inferior to surgical replacement. Before randomization, patients were entered into 
one of two cohorts on the basis of clinical and imaging findings; 76.3% of the patients were 
included in the transfemoral-access cohort and 23.7% in the transthoracic-access cohort.
RESULTS
The rate of death from any cause or disabling stroke was similar in the TAVR group and 
the surgery group (P 
= 
0.001 for noninferiority). At 2 years, the Kaplan–Meier event rates 
were 19.3% in the TAVR group and 21.1% in the surgery group (hazard ratio in the TAVR 
group, 0.89; 95% confidence interval [CI], 0.73 to 1.09; P 
= 
0.25). In the transfemoral-
access cohort, TAVR resulted in a lower rate of death or disabling stroke than surgery 
(hazard ratio, 0.79; 95% CI, 0.62 to 1.00; P 
= 
0.05), whereas in the transthoracic-access 
cohort, outcomes were similar in the two groups. TAVR resulted in larger aortic-valve 
areas than did surgery and also resulted in lower rates of acute kidney injury, severe bleed-
ing, and new-onset atrial fibrillation; surgery resulted in fewer major vascular complica-
tions and less paravalvular aortic regurgitation.
CONCLUSIONS
In intermediate-risk patients, TAVR was similar to surgical aortic-valve replacement with 
respect to the primary end point of death or disabling stroke. (Funded by Edwards Life-
sciences; PARTNER 2 ClinicalTrials.gov number, NCT01314313.)

The new engl and jour nal of medicine
T
ranscatheter aortic-valve replace-
ment (TAVR) is a new therapy for patients 
with severe aortic stenosis who are not 
candidates for surgery1,2 or who are at high risk 
for complications due to surgery.3,4 The accep-
tance of the use of TAVR in high-risk patients 
was based on evidence from clinical trials5,6 that 
used early-generation TAVR devices; these pro-
cedures were associated with considerable 
 
procedure-related complications.7-9 Recently, in-
creased operator experience and enhanced trans-
catheter valve systems have led to a worldwide 
trend to use TAVR in patients who are at low or 
intermediate risk.10-12 This trend has been evalu-
ated in small observational studies,13-17 but since 
most patients who are currently recommended 
for surgery are at low or intermediate risk,5,6,18 
the expansion of the use of TAVR mandates rig-
orous clinical-trial validation. We report the re-
sults from the Placement of Aortic Transcatheter 
Valves (PARTNER) 2 cohort A randomized trial, 
in which TAVR with a second-generation valve 
system was compared with conventional surgery 
in patients with severe aortic stenosis and inter-
mediate-risk clinical profiles.
Methods
Patients
From December 2011 through November 2013, 
we enrolled 2032 patients with severe aortic ste-
nosis and cardiac symptoms at 57 centers in the 
United States and Canada. Patients were consid-
ered to be at intermediate risk on the basis of 
clinical assessments by a multidisciplinary heart 
team, which used a guideline that was based on 
a risk model developed by the Society of Thoracic 
Surgeons (STS) to estimate the risk of death at 
30 days after surgery.19 Scoring on the STS risk 
model uses an algorithm that is based on the 
presence of coexisting illnesses to predict mor-
tality at 30 days. The STS score equals the pre-
dicted mortality expressed as a percentage. In 
this trial, the guideline was a risk score of at 
least 4.0%; the upper limit applied by the case 
review committee was 8.0%, but this value was 
not prespecified. Patients with an STS risk score 
of less than 4.0% could also be enrolled if there 
were coexisting conditions that were not repre-
sented in the risk model.
The complete list of inclusion and exclusion 
criteria is provided in Table S1 in the Supplemen-
tary Appendix, available with the full text of this 
article at NEJM.org. Patients with concomitant 
noncomplex coronary artery disease requiring 
revascularization could be enrolled and treated 
according to the judgment of the heart team 
with percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) 
or coronary-artery bypass graft (CABG) surgery.
Device and Procedure
The balloon-expandable SAPIEN XT heart-valve 
system (Edwards Lifesciences) and the TAVR 
procedure have been described previously.20 The 
major differences of the SAPIEN XT system, as 
compared with the first-generation SAPIEN valve 
system, are a thinner strut cobalt–chromium 
frame, a partially closed resting geometry of the 
bovine pericardial leaflets, the addition of a valve 
size that is 29 mm in diameter, and a reduced-
profile delivery catheter (Fig. S1 in the Supple-
mentary Appendix). Patients assigned to TAVR 
underwent either transfemoral or transthoracic 
placement of the valve. Transthoracic placement 
used the same valve placed through either the 
transapical or transaortic access route. All the 
patients received aspirin (81 mg) and clopidogrel 
(≥300 mg) before the procedure and heparin 
during the procedure; patients continued to take 
aspirin indefinitely and clopidogrel for a mini-
mum of 1 month.
Trial Design
The trial incorporated two parallel prospective, 
multicenter, randomized trials that used the 
SAPIEN XT valve system. The results from the 
PARTNER cohort B trial have been reported pre-
viously,21 and the design of the PARTNER cohort 
A trial is shown in Figure S2 in the Supplemen-
tary Appendix. After fulfilling the enrollment 
criteria, patients underwent an evaluation of their 
peripheral arteries before randomization to sep-
arate patients who were eligible for transfemoral 
placement from those requiring transthoracic 
placement. Patients were stratified in cohorts 
according to access route (transfemoral or trans-
thoracic) and were then randomly assigned (in a 
1:1 ratio) to undergo either transcatheter or surgi-
cal aortic-valve replacement. The cohorts defined 
according to assignment to access route consti-
tuted a prespecified subgroup, but the study was 
not powered for an analysis of this subgroup. 
The intention-to-treat population was used in 
the analyses of the primary and secondary end

points. The as-treated analysis included only 
patients who at least began to undergo the pro-
cedure (i.e., received sedation or anesthesia in 
the procedure room) even if the procedure was 
not completed, and the valve-implant subgroup, 
which included patients who received the intend-
ed valve therapy, was used for all echocardio-
graphic analyses.
Trial Oversight
The trial was designed and monitored by the 
sponsor (Edwards Lifesciences) and the execu-
tive committee, which included five cardiac 
surgeons and five interventional cardiologists. 
The sponsor funded the trial and participated 
in the selection of the trial sites, the collection 
of the data, and data monitoring. The executive 
committee met in person every 8 to 12 weeks to 
monitor all aspects of trial conduct. All the pa-
tients were reviewed before randomization by 
means of teleconference calls by the case-review 
committee. The data were analyzed by an inde-
pendent biostatistical consultant who is one of 
the authors.
The principal investigators and other mem-
bers of the executive committee had unrestricted 
access to the data after the database was locked, 
and they prepared all drafts of the manuscript. 
The first author wrote the first draft of the 
manuscript. No one who is not an author con-
tributed to the writing of the manuscript. The 
members of the executive committee attest to 
the completeness and accuracy of the reported 
data and analyses and to the adherence of the 
trial to the protocol (available at NEJM.org). The 
trial was approved by the institutional review 
board at each site, and written informed consent 
was obtained from all the patients.
End Points
The primary end point was a nonhierarchical 
composite of death from any cause or disabling 
stroke at 2 years in the intention-to-treat popu-
lation; all the patients were followed for at least 
2 years. Disabling stroke was defined as a score 
of at least 2 on the modified Rankin scale 
(scores range from 0 [no symptoms] to 6 [death]) 
at 90 days after the index clinical event.22 All the 
patients were seen by trained neurologists, and 
neurologic events were adjudicated by a stroke 
neurologist who was on the clinical-events com-
mittee and unaware of which procedure the pa-
tients were assigned to. Definitions of specific 
end points are provided in Table S2 in the Sup-
plementary Appendix. All echocardiograms from 
the valve-implant population were analyzed by 
the core laboratory. The grading of paravalvular 
aortic regurgitation was based on an expanded 
and more granular classification scheme that 
was then collapsed to the standard classification 
scheme.23
Statistical Analysis
We estimated that a sample of 2000 patients 
would provide the trial with a power of at least 
80% to show the noninferiority of TAVR to sur-
gery with respect to the primary end point at 
2 years, assuming an event rate of 30% in each 
group. Analyses of the primary end point were 
prespecified and powered for both the intention-
to-treat population and the as-treated population.
We used Fisher’s exact test to compare cate-
gorical variables. Continuous variables, which are 
presented as means with standard deviations, 
were compared with the use of Student’s t-test 
or the Wilcoxon rank-sum test. Time-to-event 
analyses, which were based on all available 
follow-up data, were performed with the use of 
Kaplan–Meier estimates and were compared 
with the use of the log-rank test. The relation-
ship of the baseline covariates to the primary 
end point was evaluated with the use of a Cox 
proportional-hazards regression model to calcu-
late hazard ratios in the subgroups and to test 
for interactions.
Throughout the article, the term “risk ratio” 
refers to a point-in-time analysis, with the use of 
the Kaplan–Meier event rates and the Green-
wood standard error; the term “hazard ratio” 
refers to the result from a Cox proportional-
hazards analysis. Noninferiority was to be estab-
lished if the upper boundary of the two-sided 
95% confidence interval (one-sided alpha, 0.025) 
for the risk ratio of the primary end point at 
2 years was below the prespecified noninferior-
ity ratio of 1.20.
Multivariate models used automatic variable 
selection, starting with all variables showing a 
P value of less than 0.20 in univariate analyses. 
An additional time-dependent covariate analysis 
was performed to test the association of compli-
cations during TAVR or surgery with mortality. 
All P values in the article are presented without 
correction for multiple comparisons and should

Results
Patients
Among the 2032 patients who underwent ran-
domization, 1011 were assigned to TAVR and 
1021 to surgery. A total of 1550 patients (76.3%) 
were suitable candidates for transfemoral place-
ment, and 482 patients (23.7%) were in the 
transthoracic cohort. The 236 patients in the 
TAVR group who were in the transthoracic 
 
cohort underwent either transapical access (174 
patients) or transaortic access (62).
The characteristics of the patients at baseline 
were well balanced in the two trial groups (Ta-
ble 1). The mean STS score was 5.8% in each 
group; 6.7% of the patients had an STS score 
that was less than 4.0%, 81.3% had a score that 
was between 4.0% and 8.0%, and 12.0% had a 
score that was greater than 8.0%.
A total of 94 patients (4.6%) were enrolled but 
did not undergo the assigned procedure, includ-
ing 17 patients in the TAVR group and 77 in 
the surgery group. The main reason for non-
treatment was withdrawal from the trial, most 
commonly owing to a decision after randomiza-
tion not to undergo surgery.
Procedure Outcomes
A total of 18 patients (0.9%; 10 patients in the 
TAVR group and 8 in the surgery group) died 
during the procedure or within 3 days afterward. 
In 28 patients (1.4%; 20 patients in the TAVR 
group and 8 in the surgery group), the assigned 
procedure was initiated but the patient did not 
receive a valve implant. The reasons for the valve 
not being implanted are shown in Figure S3 in 
the Supplementary Appendix.
Among 10 of 994 patients in the TAVR group 
(0.1%) with valve embolization, 4 had a second 
transcatheter valve implanted, the procedure was 
aborted in 2, the procedure was converted to 
surgery in 3, and 1 died. A second transcatheter 
valve was placed within the first valve in 22 ad-
ditional patients (2.2%) because of moderate or 
severe aortic regurgitation. A total of 86 of 944 
patients (9.1%) had concomitant planned or un-
planned procedures during surgery, including 
aortic endarterectomy, aortic-root enlargement 
or replacement, and mitral-valve or tricuspid-
valve repair or replacement. Among the patients 
in whom the randomly assigned procedure was 
initiated, 137 of 944 patients in the surgery 
group (14.5%) underwent CABG, and 39 of 994 
in the TAVR group (3.9%) underwent PCI.
Death and Stroke
There was no significant difference in the pri-
mary end point of death from any cause or dis-
abling stroke at 2 years between the TAVR group 
and the surgery group in either the intention-to-
treat analysis (hazard ratio in the TAVR group, 
0.89; 95% confidence interval [CI], 0.73 to 1.09; 
P 
= 
0.25) or the as-treated analysis (hazard ratio, 
0.87; 95% CI, 0.71 to 1.07; P 
= 
0.18) (Fig. 1). The 
risk ratio at 2 years for the primary end point in 
the TAVR group as compared with the surgery 
group was 0.92 (95% CI, 0.77 to 1.09) in the 
intention-to-treat analysis and 0.90 (95% CI, 0.75 
to 1.08) in the as-treated analysis. The risk ratio 
met the criterion for noninferiority (P 
= 
0.001 in 
the intention-to-treat analysis and P<0.001 in the 
as-treated analysis) (Fig. S7 in the Supplemen-
tary Appendix).
In the transfemoral-access cohort, TAVR re-
sulted in a lower rate of death from any cause or 
disabling stroke than did surgery (hazard ratio 
in the intention-to-treat analysis, 0.79; 95% CI, 
0.62 to 1.00; P 
= 
0.05; hazard ratio in the as-
treated analysis, 0.78; 95% CI, 0.61 to 0.99; 
P 
= 
0.04) (Fig. 1). However, there was no sig-
nificant between-group difference in the trans-
thoracic-access cohort (hazard ratio in the inten-
tion-to-treat analysis, 1.21; 95% CI, 0.84 to 1.74; 
P 
= 
0.31; hazard ratio in the as-treated analysis, 
1.14; 95% CI, 0.79 to 1.65; P 
= 
0.47) (Fig. S4 in 
the Supplementary Appendix). Results of sub-
group analyses with interaction testing for the 
primary end point were consistent across all the 
subgroups shown in Fig. 2.
The results with respect to the individual com-
ponents of the primary end point, death or stroke, 
were also similar in the two groups (Table 2). At 
2 years, the rate of death from any cause was 
16.7% after TAVR and 18.0% after surgery, and 
the rate of disabling stroke was 6.2% after TAVR 
and 6.4% after surgery. Earlier outcomes at 30 
days and 1 year similarly showed no significant 
differences between TAVR and surgery with re-
spect to the primary end point and with respect 
to the individual components of death or stroke

Scoring on the risk model of the Society of Thoracic Surgeons (STS) uses an algorithm that is based on the presence of 
coexisting illnesses in order to predict 30-day operative mortality. The STS score equals the predicted mortality expressed 
as a percentage. Less than 5% of patients in the population on which the STS algorithm is based had a predicted oper-
ative mortality (risk score) of more than 10%. Data on this score were missing for one patient.

The new engl and jour nal of medicine
trial groups are presented in Table S7 in the 
Supplementary Appendix. Treatment assignment 
to TAVR or surgery was not a significant predic-
tor of mortality. The time-dependent effects of 
disabling stroke, life-threatening bleeding, acute 
kidney injury, and major vascular complication 
were all significantly associated with a higher 
risk of death over the period of 2 years in both 
the TAVR group and the surgery group (P<0.001 
for all comparisons).
 
Other Clinical End Points
At 30 days, major vascular complications were 
more frequent in the TAVR group than in the 
surgery group (7.9% vs. 5.0%, P 
= 
0.008) (Table 2). 
However, several other complications were less 
frequent in the TAVR group than in the surgery 
group, including life-threatening bleeding (10.4% 
vs. 43.4%, P<0.001), acute kidney injury (1.3% vs. 
3.1%, P 
= 
0.006), and new-onset atrial fibrillation 
(9.1% vs. 26.4%, P<0.001). The percentage of pa-

The need for new permanent pacemakers within 
30 days after the procedure was similar in the 
TAVR group and the surgery group (8.5% and 
6.9%, respectively; P 
=

All percentages are Kaplan–Meier estimates at the specific time point and thus do not equal the number of patients divided by the total 
number of patients in the treatment group. The P value is from the test statistic for testing the interaction between the treatment and 
any subgroup variable. The body-mass index is the weight in kilograms divided by the square of the height in meters. Scoring on the risk 
model of the Society of Thoracic Surgeons (STS) uses an algorithm that is based on the presence of coexisting illnesses in order to pre-
dict 30-day operative mortality. The STS score equals the predicted mortality expressed as a percentage. Less than 5% of patients in the 
population on which the STS algorithm is based had a predicted operative mortality (risk score) of more than 10%. Data were missing 
as follows: on the STS score, for 1 patient in the surgery group; on left ventricular ejection fraction, for 348 patients in the TAVR group 
and 347 in the surgery group; on moderate or severe mitral regurgitation, for 112 and 127, respectively; and on the 5-meter walk test, for 
75 and 120, respectively. CABG denotes coronary-artery bypass grafting.

Transcatheter or Surgical Aortic-Valve Replacement
maintained for 2 years (P<0.001 for all compari-
sons) (Fig. S8 in the Supplementary Appendix). 
Patients in the TAVR group had fewer cardiac 
symptoms at 30 days than did those in the sur-
gery group (P 
= 
0.001), but the frequency of car-
diac symptoms did not differ significantly at 
later time points. Patients in the TAVR group 
had a significantly shorter duration of stay in 
the intensive care unit (ICU) than did those in 
the surgery group (median, 2 vs. 4 days; P<0.001), 
as well as a shorter index hospitalization (median, 
6 vs. 9 days; P<0.001).
Echocardiographic Findings
In the case of both therapies, from baseline to 
30 days, the aortic-valve areas and the left ven-
tricular ejection fraction increased significantly 
and the mean aortic-valve gradients decreased 
significantly; these changes were sustained 
through 2 years (Fig. 3, and Table S8 in the 
Supplementary Appendix). The improvements in 
aortic-valve areas and gradients at all time points 
were significantly greater after TAVR than after 
surgery.
The frequency and severity of paravalvular 
aortic regurgitation were greater after TAVR 
than after surgery (Fig. 3). In the TAVR group at 
30 days, mild paravalvular aortic regurgitation 
was observed according to the standard classifi-
cation scheme in 22.5% of patients, and moder-
ate or severe paravalvular aortic regurgitation 
in 3.7%. Patients in the TAVR group who had 
moderate or severe, but not mild, paravalvular 
aortic regurgitation (according to either the 
standard or expanded classification scheme) at 
30 days had higher mortality during 2 years of 
follow-up than did patients who had no or trace 
regurgitation (P<0.001) (Fig. 3).
Discussion
The main results from the PARTNER 2 cohort A 
randomized trial involving intermediate-risk 
patients can be summarized as follows. First, 
TAVR, performed in experienced centers, with 
the use of a lower-profile, next-generation de-
vice, was noninferior to surgery with respect to 
outcomes at 2 years (death from any cause or 
disabling stroke). Second, bioprosthetic-valve 
gradients were lower and the areas were greater 
with the SAPIEN XT valve, as compared with 
surgical valves, whereas the incidence of paraval-
vular aortic regurgitation was higher after TAVR 
than after surgery. Third, several benefits with 
regard to secondary end points were associated 
with TAVR, including lower risks of bleeding 
events, acute kidney injury, and new-onset atrial 
fibrillation, as well as more rapid early recovery 
that resulted in shorter durations of stay in the 
ICU and hospital.
Although the trial cohort represents a lower-
risk category than cohorts in previous trials,3,4 
these patients are still among the highest-risk 
quintile of patients with aortic stenosis who are 
candidates for surgery in the United States18,24 
and elsewhere.25,26 Our findings of the noninfe-
riority of TAVR to surgery were robust, with simi-
lar between-group outcomes for the end points 
of death and stroke and with consistency across 
all the subgroups tested. The possible superior-
ity of TAVR over surgery in the transfemoral-
access cohort is a new finding for balloon-expand-
able transcatheter valves. It requires prospective 
evaluation in a suitably powered superiority 
study. If this finding is confirmed, it probably 
reflects increased operator experience and the 
effect of a low-profile enhanced TAVR system 
combining to reduce procedure-related compli-
cations.27 Conversely, the outcomes after trans-
thoracic TAVR were similar to or worse than 
those with surgery and appeared to be inferior 
to those with transfemoral TAVR. A previous 
study involving high-risk patients treated with 
TAVR also showed higher rates of adverse peri-
procedural events and death among propensity-
matched patients who underwent transapical 
access than among those who underwent trans-
femoral access.28 Further studies would be needed 
to explore the hypothesis that in intermediate-
risk patients who are not candidates for TAVR 
with transfemoral access, TAVR with transtho-
racic access may have similar or worse outcomes 
than surgery.
As has been shown previously,3,4 there was a 
greater increase in valve areas with TAVR than 
with surgery in this trial, most likely owing to 
valve-sizing differences and the ability of trans-
catheter valves to expand to the anatomical annu-
lus size, which is not possible with a fixed-size 
surgical sewing ring. Larger valve areas with 
TAVR would be expected to decrease the inci-
dence of patient–prosthesis mismatch, which 
might result in better late clinical outcomes.29

regurgitation was greater after TAVR than after 
surgery. In this trial, the incidence of moderate 
or severe paravalvular aortic regurgitation at 30 
days was less than 4%, and unlike findings in 
previous PARTNER trials,30 only moderate or 
severe, but not mild, paravalvular aortic regurgi-
tation was associated with higher subsequent 
mortality.
Even with careful neurologic evaluations in all 
patients, the frequency of stroke was the same

Transcatheter or Surgical Aortic-Valve Replacement
as or less than that in previous studies, and 
there were no significant differences between 
the TAVR group and the surgery group. The 
reasons for the lower incidence of neurologic 
events in this trial are probably multifactorial, 
including improved intraprocedural treatment of 
patients, the effect of a low-profile TAVR system, 
and more diligent treatment of new atrial fibril-
lation. The risks of all major complications with 
TAVR affecting late mortality were lower in this 
trial than in earlier randomized trials; such 
complications include strokes, major vascular or 
bleeding events, acute kidney injury, moderate 
or severe paravalvular aortic regurgitation, and 
other rare but potentially catastrophic adverse 
events (e.g., annulus rupture, valve embolization, 
and coronary obstruction).1-4,21,27,31
Coronary revascularization was more com-
monly performed in the surgery group than in 
the TAVR group (14.5% vs. 3.9%), and the addi-
tion of either CABG or PCI to valve-replacement 
therapies had no deleterious effect on mortality 
or the rate of stroke. Although this trial was not 
powered or designed to address the issue of 
concomitant valve replacement and coronary re-
vascularization, these results are counter to previ-
ous findings that the addition of CABG to surgi-
cal aortic-valve replacement resulted in higher 
mortality.32-34
Our trial has several limitations. First, the 
high frequency of unexpected withdrawals in 
patients who were scheduled to undergo sur-
gery mandated a careful examination of both 
the intention-to-treat population and the as-treated 
population. Nevertheless, the prespecified analy-
sis of the primary and secondary end points in 
the as-treated population revealed no important 
differences from the results of the intention-to-
treat analysis. Second, further technological ad-
vances may favorably influence the outcomes 
with TAVR in the future, and the SAPIEN XT 
valve that was used in this trial has already been 
replaced by the SAPIEN 3 valve system.35,36 Third, 
in this trial, multislice computed tomography 
was not used consistently to assess aortic an-
nulus dimensions for appropriate valve sizing.37 
Also, the recent finding of subclinical valve-
leaflet thrombosis with the use of high-resolu-
tion imaging techniques was not systematically 
evaluated in the current trial.38 Finally, long-term 
assessments of the durability of bioprosthetic 
transcatheter valves (i.e., through 10 years) remain 
a limitation, although 5-year echocardiographic 
evaluations from the earlier PARTNER trials in-
dicate no evidence of important premature or 
accelerated structural valve deterioration.39,40
In conclusion, we found that in intermediate-
risk patients with severe symptomatic aortic ste-
nosis, surgical and transcatheter valve replace-
ment were similar with respect to the primary 
end point of death or disabling stroke for up to 
2 years and resulted in a similar degree of less-
ening of cardiac symptoms.
