Physical activity and the incidence of
multiple sclerosis
ABSTRACT
Objective: To study whether physical activity during adulthood or early life is associated with
multiple sclerosis (MS) incidence in 2 prospective cohorts of women.
Methods: Women in the Nurses’ Health Study (NHS) (n 5 81,723; 1986–2004) and NHS II (n 5
111,804; 1989–2009) reported recent physical activity at baseline and in selected follow-up
questionnaires. Using this information, we calculated total metabolic equivalent hours of physical
activity per week, a measure of energy expenditure. There were 341 confirmed MS cases with
first symptoms after baseline. Participants also reported early-life activity. To estimate relative
rates (RRs) and 95% confidence intervals (CIs), we used Cox proportional hazards models, adjust-
ing for age, latitude of residence at age 15, ethnicity, smoking, supplemental vitamin D, and body
mass index at age 18.
Results: Compared with women in the lowest baseline physical activity quartile, women in the
highest quartile had a 27% reduced rate of MS (RRpooled 5 0.73, 95% CI 0.55–0.98; p-trend
0.08); this trend was not present in 6-year lagged analyses. Change in physical activity analyses
suggested that women reduced activity before onset of MS symptoms. In NHS and NHS II, higher
strenuous activity at ages 18–22 years was weakly associated with a decreased MS rate. How-
ever, in NHS II, total early-life activity at ages 12–22 was not associated with MS.
Conclusions: Though higher physical activity at baseline was weakly associated with lower MS
risk, this may have been due to women reducing physical activity in response to subclinical MS.

Clinical research has found that among patients with multiple sclerosis (MS) with mild or
moderate disability, exercise improves muscular strength and aerobic capacity and may
improve mobility, fatigue, and health-related quality of life.1 Previous work has suggested
exercise or physical activity might even slow progression of MS, though evidence is inconsis-
tent.2 Exercise could potentially modify MS disease activity via multiple mechanisms, includ-
ing modulating immune factors and stress hormones and mediating expression of neuronal
growth factors.3,4
Little research has assessed the association of physical activity with the risk of incident MS.5–7
Two case-control studies found that, before diagnosis, individuals with MS tended to be more
physically active than controls.5,6 Another found no difference in pre-onset physical activity
levels between cases and controls.7 These studies, however, collected physical activity exposure
after MS diagnosis and did not use detailed or validated questionnaires to assess physical activity.
Given this background, we prospectively examined the association between physical activity
during early life and during adulthood with MS incidence in 2 large cohorts of US women: the
Nurses’ Health Study (NHS) and the NHS II (NHS II).

 METHODS Participants. NHS began in 1976; investigators
recruited 121,701 female nurses, 30–55 years old. NHS II began
in 1989; investigators recruited 116,430 female nurses, 25–42
years old. Every 2 years, women complete a questionnaire to
update lifestyle exposures and medical conditions. The first
assessment of current levels of physical activity was in 1986 in
NHS and 1989 in NHS II; the dates of return of these question-
naires were the start of follow-up (baseline) for each cohort,
respectively. We excluded participants who were missing or had
incomplete baseline physical activity or extreme baseline physical
activity values (.4 h/d8 or $125 metabolic equivalent [MET]–
h/wk). After exclusions, there were 81,723 women in NHS and
111,804 women in NHS II.
Standard protocol approvals, registrations, and patient
consents. The institutional review board of Brigham and Wom-
en’s Hospital approved this study.
Ascertainment of MS. Participants with newly diagnosed MS
self-report their diagnoses on biennial questionnaires. We asked
women for permission to contact their neurologists for medical
records, clinical history (including diagnosis date and date of first
symptoms), and the neurologist’s certainty of diagnosis (definite,
probable, possible, not MS). Since 2003, the study neurologist (T.
C.) has reviewed all medical records. If a neurologist did not
respond, we sent a questionnaire to the participant’s internist.
For 90% of women with MS, the treating physician was
a neurologist. In most cases, diagnosis was supported by MRI
findings (.70% NHS; .90% NHS II). For these analyses, we
defined confirmed cases as those with definite or probable MS
according to neurologist or internist and with onset of first
neurologic symptoms after baseline, in an effort to avoid the
potential effect of reverse causation.9 There were 50 cases of MS
(28 definite, 22 probable) in NHS and 291 cases (200 definite, 91
probable) in NHS II with first MS symptoms after baseline that
had complete information on baseline physical activity, yielding
341 MS cases.
Assessment of physical activity. At baseline, participants re-
ported average time per week (7 categories, 0–$11 hours) spent
during the previous year participating in the following activities:
walking or hiking outdoors; jogging (.10 minutes per mile);
running (#10 minutes per mile); bicycling; lap swimming; ten-
nis, squash, or racquetball; calisthenics, aerobics, aerobic dance,
or rowing machine; and (NHS II only) other aerobic recreation.
They also reported usual outdoor walking pace (easy [,2 miles
per hour (mph)], average [2–2.9 mph], brisk [3–3.9 mph], very
brisk [$4 mph]) and average flights of stairs walked daily (cate-
gories from #2 to .15). Similar questions were asked in NHS in
1988, 1992, 1994, 1996, 1998, and 2000 and in NHS II in
1991, 1997, 2001, and 2005. Based on reported hours of partic-
ipation and assigned MET score10 for each activity, total MET-h/
wk, a measure of energy expenditure, was derived.11
In a validation study of a random sample from NHS II, par-
ticipants completed past-week activity recalls and 1-week activity
diaries 4 times throughout 1 year.12 Among 149 participants,
correlations between questionnaire-reported activity and that re-
ported by past-week activity recalls and activity diaries were 0.79
and 0.62, respectively.12 The correlation between questionnaires
administered 2 years apart was 0.59.
In 1988 (NHS) and 1989 (NHS II), women provided infor-
mation about early-life physical activity: the number of months
per year (0, 1–3, 4–6, 7–9, 10–12) they engaged in strenuous
aerobic physical activity at least twice per week during high school
(ages 14–17; NHS II) and between the ages of 18 and 22 (NHS/
NHS II). In NHS II, in 1997, women reported more detailed early-
life activity, specifically the average time per week (categories, 0–$
11 hours) spent walking to/from school/work, doing moderate
recreational activity, and doing strenuous recreational activity in
grades 7–8 (ages 12–13), grades 9–12 (ages 14–17), and at ages
18–22. For each age period, we created a total MET-h/week activ-
ity score weighted by intensity.13 In analyses, we used all early-life
activity assessments (NHS [1988] and NHS II [1989, 1997]).
Covariates. Women reported information on state of residence at
age 15 (1992, NHS; 1993, NHS II) and ancestry (1992, NHS;
1989, NHS II; South European, Scandinavian, other Caucasian,
African American, Hispanic, Asian, Native American [NHS only],
other) and were categorized as previously described.9 Women up-
dated smoking status every 2 years; pack-years of smoking were
derived from this information. Women completed comprehensive
validated semiquantitative food frequency questionnaires14 every 4
years and supplemental vitamin D intake (IU/d) was derived using
reported intake. In 1980 (NHS) and 1989 (NHS II), women
reported their current height and weight at age 18; body mass
index (BMI) at age 18 was calculated by dividing age 18 weight
(in kilograms) by reported height (in meters) squared.
Statistical analyses. For adult physical activity, person-time
accrued from the date of return of the first physical activity
questionnaire (baseline) to the date of first symptoms of MS,
death from any cause, or loss to or end of follow-up (May 31,
2004, for NHS and May 31, 2009, for NHS II), whichever
occurred first. For early-life activity, however, we followed
women until date of MS diagnosis, rather than first MS
symptoms, as most women would not have MS symptoms in
early life, thereby minimizing concerns about reverse causation.
In sensitivity analyses, we used date of first MS symptoms. We
used Cox proportional hazards models to estimate relative rates
(RR). To account for potential confounding by age and time,
models were stratified by 5-year age categories and 2-year time
intervals. We additionally adjusted for other potential MS risk
factors defined above.15–17 We used missing indicators for any
covariates with missing information. In secondary analyses, we
further adjusted for ultraviolet B (UVB) flux in state of
residence in 1986 (NHS) or 1989 (NHS II).
Trend tests were carried out by modeling median values of
physical activity quartiles as a continuous variable. We included
product terms of exposure and age groups to test for violations
of the proportional hazards assumption of the Cox models. We
carried out analyses separately in each cohort and pooled RRs
using a fixed effects model with the inverse of the variance of
the rate estimates as the weight; we used a Q statistic to assess esti-
mate heterogeneity.18 We conducted all analyses using SAS, ver-
sion 9.3. All p values are 2-sided.
Adult physical activity. The main physical activity exposure
was quartiles of baseline MET-h/wk. We also examined the
association of incident MS with quartiles of cumulative average
MET-h/wk, derived from all available activity questionnaires up
to the start of each 2-year follow-up interval.19 As women may
have changed physical activity in response to subclinical MS, we
performed lagged analyses of baseline and cumulative average
physical activity by excluding the first 4 and 6 years of follow-up.
We chose these lag periods to assess potential influence of sub-
clinical MS on physical activity levels, while maintaining suffi-
cient cases to have reasonable power. We also separately assessed
associations between baseline vigorous ($6 METs) activity
(jogging; running; bicycling; lap swimming; tennis, squash, or
racquetball; calisthenics, aerobics, aerobic dance, or rowing
machine; and stair climbing)20 and moderate (2.5–4.5 METs)
activity (walking or hiking outdoors) with incident MS.

 Early-life activity. Strenuous early-life activity (months per
year of strenuous activity reported in NHS [1988] and NHS II
[1989]) was categorized as 0, 1–3, 4–6, or 7–12 months per year.
There were 130 cases of MS (84 definite, 46 probable; ages 18–22)
in NHS and 445 cases (320 definite and 125 probable; high school
and ages 18–22) in NHS II with diagnosis of MS after 1986 or
1989, respectively, yielding 575 MS cases for strenuous activity
analyses at ages 18–22. For analyses of total early-life physical
activity reported in 1997 in NHS II, we categorized total activity
during each age period into previously used categories (,21, 21–
36, 36–48, 48–72, $72 MET-h/wk)13 and started follow-up in
1997; there were 195 cases (124 definite and 71 probable in NHS
II) with date of MS diagnosis after the 1997 questionnaire.
Activity change analysis. We assessed whether participants
with MS changed activity levels after MS onset. We calculated
the difference between date of each questionnaire return and date
of first symptoms (and separately for date of diagnosis). For each
questionnaire cycle, we standardized total physical activity (MET-
h/wk) as the percentage of the mean total activity of individuals
who did not develop MS during follow-up. For years in which
physical activity was not asked (NHS: 1990, 2002, 2006; NHS
II: 1993, 1999, 2005, 2009), we averaged activity from the
closest questionnaire cycles.21 We fit linear regression models
separately in each cohort, regressing percent physical activity on
age, age2, pack-years, latitude of residence at age 15, ethnicity,
BMI at age 18, and supplemental vitamin D intake. For each
patient, the residual from this model is the difference between her
standardized activity and the average standardized activity of
participants without MS of the same age and with the same
other characteristics at the same questionnaire cycle. We
calculated mean residuals for cases for each questionnaire
period in both NHS and NHS II cohorts combined and
plotted mean residuals according to time from first symptoms
(or diagnosis). We used generalized estimating equations to test
the linearity of physical activity changes over time. We conducted
all analyses using SAS, version 9.3 (SAS Institute, Cary, NC).
RESULTS Compared with women who were less
active at baseline, the most active participants had
higher intake of supplemental vitamin D (table 1).
We followed NHS participants for up to 18 years
(average 16.7 years) and NHS II participants for up
to 20 years (average 18.2 years). Total baseline physical
activity and cumulative average physical activity were
associated with a reduced MS rate (table 2). Compared
with women in the lowest quartile of baseline activity,
those in the highest quartile had a 27% reduced rate of
MS (table 2). In pooled analyses, higher baseline vig-
orous activity was associated with only a modest and
nonsignificant reduction in MS incidence (RR, com-
paring women in the highest quartile of vigorous activ-
ity with those in the lowest, 0.85; 95% confidence
interval [CI] 0.62–1.17; p-trend 0.21). There was no
association between moderate activity and incident MS
(RR 0.90; 95% CI 0.66–1.22; p-trend 0.34). When
we carried out 6-year lagged analyses, there was no
longer a trend of association between baseline activity
and MS (table 2) or between vigorous activity and MS
(p-trend 0.67). However, the pooled relative rates were
still less than 1.
In pooled analyses, MS risk decreased with increas-
ing number of months of strenuous aerobic activity at
ages 18–22 (figure 1A). However, in NHS II, higher
levels of activity (MET-h/wk) reported during ages 12–
13, 14–17, and 18–22 were not associated with MS
(figure 1B); results were similar when we started follow-
up in 1989 or when using date of first symptoms.
The association between baseline activity and MS
was not materially changed when we adjusted for

 UVB flux. When we restricted analyses to definite
cases in NHS II, results were similar for baseline
and cumulative average exposures (sample size in
NHS too small for a comparable analysis). Analyses
of definite cases for early-life physical activity in
NHS and NHS II also yielded similar results.
Change in physical activity analyses suggested that
physical activity decreased among women with MS
over time, relative to women without MS (figure 2).
There was a decrease in activity up to 6 years before
the first symptoms of MS.
DISCUSSION In
this
large,
longitudinal
study,
women who reported higher average physical activity
levels in adulthood had a lower risk of MS than less
active women. However, this trend was not present
in 6-year lagged analyses, suggesting lower physical
activity could have been an early sign, rather than
cause, of MS. There was no consistent association of
early-life activity with MS. Furthermore, we observed
decreased physical activity at or before MS onset.
In an Israeli study, compared to controls from the
1961 census, 241 individuals with prevalent MS
residing in Israel in 1966 did not report different
physical activity levels before MS onset.7 In a study
of 100 MS cases in Canada, cases were more likely to
report spending leisure time doing physical activities
before the onset of MS symptoms than were controls
(patients with rheumatoid arthritis).5 In another more
recent Canadian study, newly diagnosed patients with
MS reported being more physically active (relative to
the general population of the same age and sex) dur-
ing the year before MS diagnosis than did controls.6
These studies might have been biased due to recall
bias, selection bias, and exposure measurement error.
In addition, none of the studies used detailed or val-
idated questionnaires to assess physical activity.
In contrast, our study consisted of 2 large cohorts
with long follow-up. Though information on leisure-
time physical activity was self-reported, it was col-
lected via structured questionnaires. Physical activity
as assessed by these questionnaires has been associated
with a decreased risk of coronary heart disease,22
stroke,23 diabetes,24 and cancer.13,25–27 Adult physical
activity exposures were prospectively reported and
have been validated.12,28 We were also able to assess
physical activity changes before and after reported
onset of MS symptoms and MS diagnosis.
The biological mechanisms through which physi-
cal activity could relate to MS risk are unknown.

 Exercise could potentially modify MS disease activity
by mediating expression of neuroactive proteins, such
as insulin-like growth factor-I, which appears to be
neuroprotective, and other neurotrophic factors that
are likely involved in neuronal survival and activity-
dependent plasticity,3 as well as via effects on inflam-
mation, stress hormones, and immune function.4
These same mechanisms could also potentially influ-
ence the development of MS.
Evidence suggests that relative to nondiseased
populations, patients with MS are less physically
active.29,30 A recent study among 118 patients with
MS found that, after diagnosis, 38% of participants
stopped physical activity and many reduced frequency
of activity.31 In our study, participants could have
possibly reduced physical activity in response to pre-
diagnosis symptoms.31 In an effort to address this, we
carried out several analyses. Though total physical
activity was weakly associated with a lower rate of
MS in non-lagged analyses, this trend was no longer
present when we carried out 6-year lagged analyses.
We found no consistent pattern of association
between early-life physical activity and incident MS,
which does not support biological plausibility. Addi-
tionally, change in physical activity analyses suggested
a decrease in activity at or before MS symptom onset.
Overall, these results are supportive of women reduc-
ing physical activity in response to MS symptoms.
Limitations to our study include that early-life
physical activity was not validated. Adult activity
was not validated against accelerometry data or fitness
in these cohorts. However, a study among middle-
aged women reported good correlations of the NHS
II questionnaire-estimated physical activity with aver-
age accelerometer counts (0.42) and estimated and
measured maximal oxygen uptake (0.49, 0.54).28 In
a validation study of men, there was a stronger corre-
lation of physical activity estimated by questionnaire
with that estimated by diary for vigorous activity than
for moderate activity.20 As a result, we expect less
measurement error for vigorous activity than for
moderate or total activity analyses. Given the prospec-
tive nature of this study, we would expect any mea-
surement error to be nondifferential.
Some MS cases could possibly have been misdiag-
nosed. However, analyses of baseline and cumulative
average physical activity yielded similar results when
we restricted to definite cases. All participants in
our cohorts are registered nurses, likely with similar
access to health care; of MS cases diagnosed after
1990, more than 90% have MRI findings supporting
MS diagnosis. In addition, in these cohorts, the HLA-
DRB1*1501 allele has been associated with the ex-
pected increased risk of MS.32 We cannot rule out
possible bias due to confounding. In addition to
vitamin D intake and smoking, other behaviors are
likely related to physical activity. However, with the
exception of Epstein-Barr virus antibody titers, 25-
hydroxyvitamin D (25[OH]D) levels, and HLA-
DRB1 genotype, we adjusted for all major known
MS risk factors. In 25(OH)D prediction models
developed in NHS and NHS II, physical activity
quintiles were associated with higher predicted 25
(OH)D levels (p , 0.0001).33 Though we did not
adjust for 25(OH)D levels, we adjusted for supple-
mental vitamin D intake, which is associated with
higher predicted 25(OH)D levels33 and MS risk.16
It remains unclear how much of the association
between physical activity and MS might have been
due to more active women having more sunlight
exposure, a major vitamin D source,34 than less active
women. When we adjusted for UVB flux, results for
total baseline physical activity did not change mate-
rially. This study only includes women and over 95%

 were Caucasian, so our results may not be generaliz-
able to men or other race groups.
In this large prospective study with validated
measures of physical activity, we found weak and
nonconvincing evidence that higher physical activity
reduces the risk of incident MS. Although prior work
has shown that physical activity has numerous health
benefits,35 it seems unlikely that it protects against
risk of developing MS. Our study does not directly
address whether physical activity has any benefits in
patients with MS, but physical activity should be
recommended for individuals with MS because of
its beneficial effects on cardiovascular outcomes,
which are a major cause of morbidity and mortality
in individuals with MS.
