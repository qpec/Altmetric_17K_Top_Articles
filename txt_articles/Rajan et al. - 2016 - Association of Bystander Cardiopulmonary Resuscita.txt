BACKGROUND: Bystander-initiated cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR) 
increases patient survival after out-of-hospital cardiac arrest, but it is unknown 
to what degree bystander CPR remains positively associated with survival with 
increasing time to potential defibrillation. The main objective was to examine 
the association of bystander CPR with survival as time to advanced treatment 
increases.
METHODS: We studied 7623 out-of-hospital cardiac arrest patients between 
2005 and 2011, identified through the nationwide Danish Cardiac Arrest 
Registry. Multiple logistic regression analysis was used to examine the 
association between time from 911 call to emergency medical service 
arrival (response time) and survival according to whether bystander CPR was 
provided (yes or no). Reported are 30-day survival chances with 95% bootstrap 
confidence intervals.
RESULTS: With increasing response times, adjusted 30-day survival chances 
decreased for both patients with bystander CPR and those without. However, 
the contrast between the survival chances of patients with versus without 
bystander CPR increased over time: within 5 minutes, 30-day survival was 
14.5% (95% confidence interval [CI]: 12.8–16.4) versus 6.3% (95% CI: 
5.1–7.6), corresponding to 2.3 times higher chances of survival associated 
with bystander CPR; within 10 minutes, 30-day survival chances were 6.7% 
(95% CI: 5.4–8.1) versus 2.2% (95% CI: 1.5–3.1), corresponding to 3.0 times 
higher chances of 30-day survival associated with bystander CPR. The contrast 
in 30-day survival became statistically insignificant when response time was 
>13 minutes (bystander CPR vs no bystander CPR: 3.7% [95% CI: 2.2–5.4] 
vs 1.5% [95% CI: 0.6–2.7]), but 30-day survival was still 2.5 times higher 
associated with bystander CPR. Based on the model and Danish out-of-hospital 
cardiac arrest statistics, an additional 233 patients could potentially be saved 
annually if response time was reduced from 10 to 5 minutes and 119 patients 
if response time was reduced from 7 (the median response time in this study) 
to 5 minutes.
CONCLUSIONS: The absolute survival associated with bystander CPR 
declined rapidly with time. Yet bystander CPR while waiting for an ambulance 
was associated with a more than doubling of 30-day survival even in case of 
long ambulance response time. Decreasing ambulance response time by even 
a few minutes could potentially lead to many additional lives saved every year.

e
arly recognition and treatment of out-of-hospital 
cardiac arrest (OHCA) are well known to increase 
the likelihood of successful resuscitation with good 
neurological outcomes1–6 without increasing the propor-
tion of patients who need permanent care.7 Several time 
factors are important for successful resuscitation after 
OHCA, including early bystander intervention in the form 
of cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR), defibrillation, and 
prompt access to advanced postresuscitation care.4,6,7
Bystander CPR sustains a small but crucial blood 
flow to vital organs that, apart from reducing the risk of 
brain damage, may prolong the time window for defibril-
lation.8,9 Studies have shown that the sooner defibrilla-
tion is achieved, the better the chances of survival.10,11 
The 3-Phase Time-Sensitive Model regarding resusci-
tation after cardiac arrest underlines a need for time-
sensitive ischemia/reperfusion therapy and proposes 
that immediate defibrillation is useful if provided within 
4 minutes of the cardiac arrest.12 However, it remains 
unknown to what extent bystander CPR continues to 
be positively associated with survival with increasing 
time to CPR by the emergency medical services and 
potential defibrillation. Such information may be useful 
for future planning of ambulance distributions, potential 
first-responder programs, and availability of automated 
external defibrillators.
Using data from the Danish Cardiac Arrest Registry, 
we assessed for how long bystander CPR was associ-
ated with 30-day survival, with duration of ambulance 
response time as a proxy for time from 911 call to 
CPR and potential defibrillation by the emergency medi-
cal services. Our primary aim was to examine the as-
sociation between bystander CPR and 30-day survival 
as response time increased compared with patients not 
receiving bystander CPR. Our secondary aim was to pro-
duce individualized predicted probability of survival mod-
els for best- and worst-case scenarios (with and without 
bystander CPR) according to increasing response time.
MethODs
Data source and Definitions
All OHCA patients between 2005 and 2011 were identified 
from the nationwide Danish Cardiac Arrest Registry. The 
Danish emergency medical services and the Danish Cardiac 
Arrest Registry have previously been described in detail.6,13,14 
Across all regions in Denmark, the emergency medical service 
is a 2-tier system with dispatch of basic life support ambu-
lances staffed with ambulance technicians or paramedics and 
mobile emergency care units supervised by specialized anes-
thesiologists or paramedics. These emergency care units are 
sent as rendezvous with the ambulances. Denmark does not 
have any structured first-responder automated external defibril-
lator programs (police or firefighters bringing a defibrillator). 
In this study, we included OHCA cases handled by the largest 
nationwide ambulance provider in Denmark (Falck A/S). Falck 
A/S provided electronic data on various time intervals for each 
OHCA, including information on ambulance response time. We 
defined the duration of response time as the time from call 
receipt by the emergency medical services until the ambu-
lance arrived at the site of OHCA. This time interval served as 
a proxy for the time to CPR and potential defibrillation by the 
emergency medical services. With the unique Civil Registration 
number provided to all residents in Denmark, we were able to 
collect information on age, sex, survival status, and hospital 
discharge diagnoses in the national administrative registries, 
as described previously.6,13,14 Information on anoxic brain dam-
age was obtained from discharge diagnoses. From Statistics 
Denmark, we obtained data on individuals entering and leaving 
nursing homes. Nursing home data have been collected since 
1994 with a validated approach to secure a high degree of 
completion of nursing home information.15
Patients were categorized into OHCA of presumed cardiac 
cause and presumed noncardiac cause and in accordance with 
the Utstein guidelines. To study a more homogenous group of 
patients, OHCA of presumed noncardiac cause were excluded 
from the final study population.16 The definition of presumed 
cardiac cause of arrest included cardiac disease, unexpected 
collapse, or unknown diseases. Other medical disorders and 
all traumas regardless of other diagnoses were defined as 
OHCA of presumed noncardiac cause (were excluded).
To calculate the number of potential lives that could be 
saved annually by decreasing response time, we obtained 
clinical Perspective
What is new?
• Bystander cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR) is 
associated with increased survival after out-of-hospi-
tal cardiac arrests, but not much is known about for 
how long CPR remains helpful.
• Bystander CPR was associated with a 2.3-fold 
increase in 30-day survival at 5 minutes and a 3.0-
fold increase at 10 minutes. The association fell 
thereafter and was statistically insignificant after 
13 minutes.
• Adjusted 30-day survival chances were 14.5% with 
bystander CPR and 6.3% without bystander CPR at 
5 minutes. The corresponding figures at 10 minutes 
were 6.7% and 2.2%, respectively.
What are the clinical implications?
• The clinical implications are related to better 
knowledge of potential duration of helpfulness of 
bystander CPR. The associations indicate a major 
effect during the first 5 to 10 minutes, and there-
after the absolute survival rapidly declines with or 
without bystander CPR.
• The study suggests that response times to 
advanced help of preferably <5 and at maximum 10 
minutes could be used in the planning of emergency 
response programs, such as ambulance distribu-
tion, organization of first responders, and distribu-
tion of automated external defibrillators.

statistics from the latest Danish Cardiac Arrest report,17 which 
reported that 3570 OHCA not witnessed by the emergency 
medical services took place during the latest year, of which 
65.8% received bystander CPR.
study Population
All patients ≥18 years of age with a presumed cardiac-caused 
OHCA for whom resuscitation was attempted were included. 
Inclusion and exclusion criteria are listed in detail in Figure 1. 
Patients who received defibrillation by a bystander were 
excluded because this study examined the importance of time 
to CPR and potential defibrillation by the emergency medical 
services.
study Outcomes
The main outcome of this study was 30-day survival. No patient 
was lost to follow-up, and hence we have complete data for 
this outcome.
statistics
Crude 30-day survival chances were computed and reported 
as relative frequencies (number of 30-day survivors divided by 
number of patients). A direct comparison of relative 30-day sur-
vival frequencies between patients with and without bystander 
CPR may be confounded by patient and OHCA characteristics. 
Therefore, the main analysis was based on a multiple logis-
tic regression model for 30-day survival outcome according 
to bystander CPR and ambulance response time and further 
adjusted for age, sex, location of arrest (private home vs pub-
lic), witnessed status, comorbidities, and year of arrest. The 
model was not adjusted for first recorded cardiac rhythm being 
shockable or nonshockable because this is an intermediate 
variable between bystander CPR and 30-day survival (online-
only Data Supplement Figure 1). In this model, the relationship 
between 30-day survival chances and ambulance response 
time was modeled by restricted cubic splines with prespecified 
knots at 5, 10, 15, and 20 minutes.18 From the logistic regres-
sion analysis, we computed 2 personalized 30-day survival 
chances for each patient. With “personalized 30-day survival 
chances,” we refer to the probability that a patient with a given 
combination of risk factors survives the first 30 days accord-
ing to our logistic regression model. For the first personalized 
30-day survival chance, we standardized the data so that all 
patients had received bystander CPR, but we kept the actual 
patient and OHCA characteristics. For the second, we stan-
dardized data so that no patient had received bystander CPR, 
but again we kept the actual patient and OHCA characteris-
tics. Reported were averages of personalized 30-day survival 
chances according to bystander CPR and ambulance response 
time, and ratios between the averaged 30-day survival chances 
for with versus without bystander CPR according to response 
time (g-formula19–21), together with 95% bootstrap confidence 
intervals based on 2000 bootstrap samples.
In addition to averages, we also show personalized 30-day 
survival chances for specific combinations of patient and OHCA 
characteristics: for a person having a witnessed arrest in pub-
lic, no known comorbidities and being ≤65 years of age (best-
case scenario), and for a person having unwitnessed arrest 
in a private home, one or more comorbidities and being >65 
years of age (worst-case scenario). Only for these analyses of 
personalized 30-day survival chances in best- and worst-case 
scenarios was age handled as a binary variable (working age 
[≤65 years] vs retirement age [>65 years]).
For the purposes of descriptive statistics for Table 1, 
response time was divided into 5-minute intervals of 0 to 5, 6 
to 10, 11 to 15, and >15 minutes. Response time was exam-
ined as a continuous variable for all other analyses.
The level of significance was set at 5%. All statistical analy-
ses were performed using SAS, version 9.4 (SAS Institute Inc.) 
and R, version 3.2.2.22

population. The patient selection process is displayed in 
 
Figure 1.
time-stratified Baseline characteristics
Table 1 depicts baseline characteristics stratified accord-
ing to bystander CPR status and response time intervals. 
With increasing response time, patients tended to be 
younger and were more likely to have an OHCA during 
nighttime regardless of bystander CPR status. Patients 
who received bystander CPR were younger than those 
without bystander CPR and had fewer arrests during 
nighttime than those without bystander CPR across time 
intervals. Although patients were significantly less likely 
to receive subsequent defibrillation by the emergency 
medical services with increasing response time in both 
bystander CPR groups, patients who received bystander 
CPR had higher rates of subsequent defibrillation com-
pared with patients without bystander CPR. For both by-
stander CPR groups, no significant statistical difference 
was found between rates of anoxic brain damage and dis-
charge to nursing home across the ambulance response 
time groups among 30-day survivors. However, when 
comparing the total population of patients who survived, 
those who did not receive bystander CPR were more like-
ly to be diagnosed with anoxic brain damage compared 
with those who received bystander CPR (12.7% vs 7.3%; 
P=0.02). Baseline characteristics across ambulance re-
sponse time for the overall population are displayed in 
online-only Data Supplement Table 1.
crude Versus standardized 30-Day survival 
chances
Rates of 30-day survival for patients with bystander 
CPR for ≤5 minutes, 6 to 10 minutes, 11 to 15 min-
utes, and >15 minutes were 22.6% (192/848), 15.3% 
(180/1180), 6.7% (44/613), and 4.7% (13/274), re-
spectively. Corresponding 30-day survival rates for pa-
tients without bystander CPR were 6.7% (111/1617), 
3.4% (64/1912), 1.3% (10/792), and 2.7% (9/331), re-
spectively. Online-only Data Supplement Figure 2 shows 
these crude survival chances as well as standardized 
survival chances according to bystander CPR and ambu-
lance response time. The difference between the crude 
and standardized results indicate confounding by patient 
and OHCA characteristics because the magnitude of the 
ratio between the standardized survival chances was 
smaller than that of the crude survival chances.
standardized 30-Day survival chances
Figure 2 displays adjusted results from the multiple logis-
tic regression analysis standardized to a setting where 
all patients versus no patients had received bystander 
CPR according to response time. In this figure, it is 
 
observed that 30-day survival chances for both bystand-
er CPR and no-bystander CPR decreased as response 
time increased: within 5 minutes, the 30-day survival 
chance was 14.5% (95% CI: 12.8–16.4) for bystander 
CPR versus 6.3% (95% CI: 5.1–7.6) for no-bystander 
CPR; within 10 minutes, the corresponding 30-day sur-
vival chance was 6.7% (95% CI: 5.4–8.1) versus 2.2% 
(95% CI: 1.5–3.1), respectively. The ratio of the stan-
dardized 30-day survival chances (g-formula) between 
bystander CPR and no-bystander CPR increased as re-
sponse time increased: at 5 minutes, bystander CPR 
was associated with a 2.3 times higher 30-day survival 
chance after OHCA, and at 10 minutes, bystander CPR 
was associated with a 3.0 times higher 30-day survival 
chance. The association between 30-day survival and 
bystander CPR compared with no-bystander CPR be-
came statistically insignificant when response time was 
˃13 minutes (3.7% [95% CI: 2.2–5.4] for bystander CPR 
vs 1.5% [95% CI: 0.6–2.7] for no-bystander CPR), but 
bystander CPR was still associated with a 2.5 times 
higher 30-day survival chance.
Online-only Data Supplement Figure 3 shows corre-
sponding results obtained in the subpopulation of only 
witnessed arrests. Similar patterns were observed, 
although with overall higher 30-day survival chances 
compared with the total study population. Online-only 
Data Supplement Figure 4 displays corresponding re-
sults obtained in a subpopulation of only unwitnessed ar-
rests. Overall 30-day survival chances were much lower 
compared with the total study population. The results 
were statistically insignificant, but similar patterns were 
observed.
Figure 2. standardized 30-day survival chances ac-
cording to duration of response time and bystander 
cardiopulmonary resuscitation status. 
The survival chances based on multiple logistic regression 
were standardized to settings where all patients versus no 
patients received bystander CPR according to ambulance re-
sponse time. The model is adjusted for age, sex, comorbidi-
ties listed in Table 1, witnessed status, location of arrest, and 
year of arrest. CPR indicates cardiopulmonary resuscitation.

Online-only Data Supplement Figure 5 examined stan-
dardized chances of absence of new onsets of anoxic 
brain damage up to 30 days after the discharge from the 
hospital among 30-day survivors according to bystander 
CPR status and increasing response time. The observed 
results were similar, with the chances of absence of new 
onset of anoxic brain damage decreasing with increas-
ing response time regardless of bystander CPR status, 
whereas the difference between the bystander CPR 
groups seemed to increase. However, the results were 
not statistically significant.
additional lives Potentially saved annually
Figure 3 displays the potential numbers of lives that 
could be saved annually in Denmark for every minute 
response time is shortened with the model from Figure 2 
and Danish OHCA Statistics.17 Figure 3 hence shows 
that by shortening response time from 10 to 5 minutes, 
an additional 233 lives could be saved each year. If re-
sponse time was shortened from 7 (median response 
time in this study) to 5 minutes, an additional 119 pa-

Figure 4 shows predicted personalized 30-day survival 
chances for an individual with the best-case scenario 
(≤65 years of age, witnessed arrest in public, no comor-
bidities) and for an individual with the worst-case sce-
nario (>65 years of age, unwitnessed arrest in a private 
home, one or more comorbidities) with and without by-
stander CPR according to response time. In the current 
study population, 3.6% of the population presented with 
the best-case scenario, whereas 11.8% of the popula-
tion presented with the worst-case scenario.
In all scenarios, the personalized 30-day survival 
chances decreased with each increasing minute of re-
sponse time, and in all scenarios, receiving bystander 
CPR was associated with the highest 30-day survival 
chances. In the best-case scenario, the 30-day survival 
chances within 5 minutes of response time was 54.2% if 
bystander CPR had been provided, whereas the chances 
decreased to 30.2% if no bystander CPR was provid-
ed (1.8 times higher 30-day survival chance in the by-
stander CPR group). By 10 minutes, the corresponding 
probabilities were 33.1% with bystander CPR and 12.2% 
with no-bystander CPR (2.7 times higher 30-day survival 
chances in the bystander CPR group), and by 15 min-
utes, the chances were 21.0% and 8.1%, respectively 
(2.5 times higher 30-day survival in the bystander CPR 
group). In the worst-case scenario, the probability of 30-
day survival within 5 minutes of response time was 4.1% 
with bystander CPR alone and 1.5% with no bystander 
CPR (2.7 times higher 30-day survival in the bystand-
er CPR group). After 10 minutes, the corresponding

Online-only Data Supplement Figure 6 shows the 
best- and worst-case scenarios further stratified accord-
ing to witnessed status. Similar results were obtained, 
although with much higher 30-day survival chances for 
both worst- and best-case scenarios for witnessed ar-
rests compared with the whole population and much 
lower 30-day survival chances for both worst- and best-
case scenarios for unwitnessed arrests. The results 
obtained for the unwitnessed arrests were statistically 
insignificant.
DiscUssiOn
This study shows that bystander CPR is positively as-
sociated with 30-day survival for both short and long 
ambulance response times and initiation of advanced 
resuscitation therapy. Although the association between 
bystander CPR and absolute survival seemed to decline 
with increasing response time, the associated relative 
benefit in survival remained high.
Early CPR saves lives. A series of studies, including 
the current study, have demonstrated strong positive as-
sociations of bystander-initiated CPR and survival.1–6 In 
this study, we were able to adjust for various prehospital 
factors while reporting predicted average 30-day surviv-
al percentages by applying causal statistics (g-formula), 
which showed that even when taking potential confound-
ers into account, bystander CPR is associated with more 
than a 2-fold increase in 30-day survival across short and 
long ambulance response times. Recent years have seen 
a substantial focus on early CPR, and in some countries, 
initiatives have been implemented to increase the rate of 
bystander CPR.4,6,23,24
In our study, ambulance response time was used as 
a proxy for time to CPR by emergency medical services 
and potential defibrillation. Identifying that the absolute 
30-day survival chances seem to decrease with increas-
ing time regardless of bystander CPR status is important 
because it implies that, although much focus should be 
made on increasing the rate of bystander intervention, 
focus also needs to be made on identifying methods to 
reduce time to potential defibrillation. This goal could 
be achieved, for example, by decreasing ambulance 
response times or implementing trained first-responder 
programs to fully leverage the potential survival benefit 
of bystander CPR. Nearby trained lay or professional 
first responders, such as police or firefighters, would be 
able to provide CPR and potential defibrillation while wait-
ing for the ambulance to arrive. This practice is in accor-
dance with a recent study that showed higher chances 
of survival for patients who received bystander CPR and 
first responder defibrillation compared with patients who 
received bystander CPR and defibrillation later by the 
ambulance personnel.4 In our study, we demonstrated 
that with increasing response time, the rates of patients 
who subsequently received defibrillation by the emergen-
cy medical services decreased. However, we also found 
that if bystander CPR was started before arrival of the 
emergency medical services, then the rate of patients

who received subsequent defibrillation by the emer-
gency medical service was 1.5 times higher compared 
with no-bystander CPR. Overall, these results are in ac-
cordance with the 3-Phase Time-Sensitive Model after 
cardiac arrest, which proposes that defibrillation within 
the first few minutes after cardiac arrest can increase 
survival chance ˃50%, but after 10 minutes, defibrillation 
has little incremental value.12 It is therefore important to 
recognize that, apart from early CPR, prompt arrival and 
deployment of defibrillation is essential to increase the 
absolute number of OHCA survivors.
In this study, we applied Danish OHCA statistics to 
our model to demonstrate how many lives that could 
potentially be saved in Denmark for every minute ambu-
lance response time is reduced, thereby for every min-
ute CPR by trained rescuers and potential defibrillation 
arrives earlier. If they arrive even just 2 minutes earlier 
than the median of 7 minutes found in our study, an ad-
ditional 119 patients could be saved yearly in Denmark. 
However, increasing ambulance density to reduce time 
to potential defibrillation can be a costly affair. Dispatch 
of nearby trained lay responders or professional first re-
sponders (police or firefighters) to assist with CPR and, 
most important, potential defibrillation could represent a 
good alternative to increase survival rates after OHCA, 
as other studies suggest.4,25 A randomized controlled 
study from Sweden has recently examined the effect of 
CPR-trained mobile-dispatched laypersons.26 The trained 
laypersons were dispatched if they were within 500 me-
ters of the arrest. The median ambulance response time 
in their study was 8 minutes, and in 23% of the cases, 
the CPR-trained layperson arrived before the emergency 
medical services, and bystander CPR rates increased 
from 47.8% to 61.6% in the same time period. A similar 
randomized controlled study with dispatch of nearby re-
sponders with automated external defibrillators to assist 
with defibrillation in addition to CPR alone is warranted.
Overall, our results suggest that dispatch of nearby 
trained lay or professional first responders to assist with 
potential defibrillation apart from CPR while waiting for 
the ambulance is likely to save more lives every year.
When examining best- and worst-case scenarios, 
large variations in predicted survival percentages were 
observed for each of these cases as expected, with 
survival probability being much higher in best-case sce-
narios. This finding reflects how the selected prehospital 
factors are closely related to survival and are therefore 
somewhat able to predict whether the cardiac arrest pa-
tient achieves long-term survival. Notably, in both sce-
narios, we found that if bystander CPR is received, the 
30-day survival probability is markedly increased com-
pared with no-bystander CPR, indicating the robustness 
of this single factor. However, when investigating the 
absolute survival probability percentages between the 
two scenarios, absolute chances of survival in especially 
the worst-case scenario was particularly dependent on 
time regardless of bystander CPR status—if potential 
defibrillation is not established relatively early, then the 
chances of survival seem to be minimal. These results 
also imply the necessity of decreasing time to potential 
defibrillation.
limitations
The main limitation of this study is that it is observa-
tional in nature. Hence, our data provide associations on 
the possible positive effect of bystander intervention on 
30-day survival across several response time intervals. 
Also, we did not have data on several important factors 
that could affect survival and ambulance response time 
simultaneously: one important factor missing was the 
time for the actual collapse and duration of bystander 
CPR, as the current ambulance response time may not 
fully portray the duration of actual CPR provided by the 
bystander, or the duration of the cardiac arrest, before 
ambulance arrival. To investigate this issue, we con-
ducted sensitivity analyses examining a subpopulation 
of witnessed arrests only. In this group of patients, the 
response time is likely to be more closely related to du-
ration of no-flow time (duration of the cardiac arrest) and 
CPR (a bystander may be more likely to start CPR imme-
diately if he or she witnessed the arrest). Although surviv-
al chances were higher across durations of ambulance 
response times in this subpopulation, these results did 
not differ from main analyses. However, it is important to 
note that it cannot be ruled out that bystanders may have 
started resuscitation before calling the emergency medi-
cal services. Other factors we did not have information 
on was the quality of the CPR given by the bystanders, 
whether they were trained in CPR and whether the CPR 
was telephone-assisted. Furthermore, in Denmark, high-
rise buildings are rare, and we did not have any data re-
garding “vertical response time.” Hence, our results may 
not be easily generalized to towns with many high-rise 
buildings with associated longer ambulance response 
times. Finally, because <1.8% of the study population 
had response times ˃20 minutes, our results have wide 
confidence intervals toward the long response times; the 
fact that the estimates increase slightly may be consid-
ered an artifact that is due to the sparse data situation in 
this region of the response
cOnclUsiOn
In this study, we demonstrated a positive association 
between bystander CPR and 30-day survival across 
ambulance response times. As ambulance response 
time increased, the absolute 30-day survival decreased 
regardless of bystander CPR status. However, the rela-
tive difference in survival was more than twice as high 
among patients who received bystander CPR compared

with those who did not across all ambulance response

Strategies to decrease ambulance response time and 
implement dispatch of nearby trained lay or professional 
first responders for quick intervention with CPR and, 
importantly, potential defibrillation are likely to increase 
survival after OHCA.
