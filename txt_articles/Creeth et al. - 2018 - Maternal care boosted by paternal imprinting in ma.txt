Abstract
In mammals, mothers are the primary caregiver, programmed, in part, by hormones pro-
duced during pregnancy. High-quality maternal care is essential for the survival and lifelong
health of offspring. We previously showed that the paternally silenced imprinted gene pleck-
strin homology-like domain family A member 2 (Phlda2) functions to negatively regulate a
single lineage in the mouse placenta called the spongiotrophoblast, a major source of hor-
mones in pregnancy. Consequently, the offspring’s Phlda2 gene dosage may influence
the quality of care provided by the mother. Here, we show that wild-type (WT) female mice
exposed to offspring with three different doses of the maternally expressed Phlda2 gene—
two active alleles, one active allele (the extant state), and loss of function—show changes
in the maternal hypothalamus and hippocampus during pregnancy, regions important for
maternal-care behaviour. After birth, WT dams exposed in utero to offspring with the highest
Phlda2 dose exhibit decreased nursing and grooming of pups and increased focus on nest
building. Conversely, ‘paternalised’ dams, exposed to the lowest Phlda2 dose, showed
increased nurturing of their pups, increased self-directed behaviour, and a decreased focus
on nest building, behaviour that was robustly maintained in the absence of genetically modi-
fied pups. This work raises the intriguing possibility that imprinting of Phlda2 contributed to
increased maternal care during the evolution of mammals.
Author summary
Female mammals are primed during pregnancy for their new role as a mother caring for
their newborn. Indirect evidence suggests that this behaviour is, in part, instructed by hor-
mones produced by the foetally derived placenta. We previously reported that the Phlda2
gene controls the size of the placental endocrine compartment that produces hormones.
Phlda2 is subject to the remarkable epigenetic process called genomic imprinting, in
which one parental allele is switched off. In the case of Phlda2, this is the paternal allele.
This raises the intriguing possibility that the father’s genome influences the quality of care

 that offspring receive from their mothers. Here, we show via genetic manipulation of pup
embryos that female mice pregnant with pups carrying the highest dose of Phlda2 favour
nest building over caring for their young or themselves. In contrast, dams exposed to the
lowest Phlda2 dose while pregnant prioritise nurturing and grooming of their young and
personal grooming. These changes in maternal focus suggest the possibility that imprint-
ing of Phlda2 contributed to enhanced maternal care in mammals. This study also pres-
ents a unique example of how the genetic makeup of offspring can influence maternal
behaviour.
Introduction
High-quality maternal care is vitally important for newborn survival and their behavioural and
metabolic health later in life, evidenced by the catastrophic consequences when maternal care
is poor or absent [1–3] (S1 Table). Maternal care provision comes at the cost of the mother’s
later reproductive fitness, whereas the paternal interest is best served by prolonged care of
progeny exclusively by the dam. Imprinted genes, expressed from a single parental allele as a
consequence of germline epigenetic events [4], are thought to be a physical embodiment of
this conflict between male and female mammals over maternal investment in offspring [5, 6].
Essentially, ‘paternalisation’ (silencing of paternal allele) is proposed to secure higher maternal
investment, while ‘maternalisation’ counteracts to protect maternal reproductive fitness [5].
While there are further refinements, alternative hypotheses, and much debate [6–8], most the-
ories are consistent with the existence of imprinted genes that influence maternal care provi-
sion. Disruption of the expression of three imprinted genes in the mother (paternally expressed
gene 1 [Peg1], paternally expressed gene 3 [Peg3], and type 3 deiodinase) results in deficits in
maternal care [9–11], and we have recently shown that loss of Peg3 in the offspring increases
maternal anxiety and decreases pup retrieval in wild-type (WT) mothers [12]. However,
deficits in maternal care are relatively common and have been reported with a myriad of
genetic modifications as well as exposures to adverse environments in pregnancy (S1 Table).
In contrast, examples of increased maternal care providing more compelling evidence for
a purposeful phenomenon are exceptionally rare and almost invariably involve hormonal
manipulations.
The placenta is a foetally derived organ fundamental to pregnancy [13, 14]. A number of
hormones produced by, or dependent on, the placenta are implicated in the programming of
maternal care during pregnancy [15] (S1 Fig). Placental lactogens, produced by placental
endocrine lineages in contact with the maternal circulation [16], are known to accumulate in
cerebrospinal fluid during pregnancy [17] and can stimulate maternal behaviour when infused
directly into the medial preoptic area in nonpregnant rodents [18]. Placental lactogens are
related to the pituitary hormone prolactin required for maternal behaviour [19, 20], and a sub-
set bind and activate the prolactin receptor [21] also required for maternal care [22, 23]. In
addition, whereas not all the genes encoding steroidogenic enzymes are expressed in the
mature mouse placenta (S1 Fig), lactogenic hormones support the production of oestrogens
and progesterone from the corpus luteum in rodents [24], which act in concert in the rapid
induction of maternal behaviour at term [25, 26]. Together, these data strongly suggest that
placental lactogens have a direct effect on maternal care behaviour. The neurotransmitter sero-
tonin, important in maternal care [27], is manufactured by the placenta, although thought to
be directed at the foetal brain [28–31]. There is less evidence that dopamine [32–34], oxytocin
[35–37], or vasopressin [38, 39] could be influenced by placental genes (S1 Fig).

 Using genetic mouse models, we identified several paternally silenced, maternally expressed
imprinted genes that function to restrain the placental lineages that produce hormones
thought to be important for maternal care behaviour in mice [40–42]. This led us to hypothe-
sise that the silencing of one or more genes by the paternal genome may have acted to boost
maternal care in mammals. The mouse pleckstrin homology-like domain family A member 2
(Phlda2) gene negatively regulates the expansion of a single placental endocrine lineage called
the spongiotrophoblast, a lineage that expresses placental lactogens, pregnancy-specific glyco-
proteins, and a number of other hormones that induce and maintain the physiological adapta-
tions required for a successful pregnancy [16], [41, 43–46]. Phlda2 is expressed from the
maternal allele primarily in the placenta [47, 48] and encodes a pleckstrin homology (PH)
domain–only protein [49] that functions to inhibit cell proliferation by repressing AKT activa-
tion [50]. Early in mouse placental development, Phlda2 supresses the proliferation of the
spongiotrophoblast [51]. Doubling the Phlda2 gene dosage (potentially resembling the ancient
preimprinted state) by means of a bacterial artificial chromosome (BAC) transgene reduces
the contribution of the spongiotrophoblast lineage to the mature placenta by approximately
50%, whereas loss of expression by knockout (KO) of the maternal allele results in a 2-fold
expansion of this lineage [41, 52–54]. Phlda2 is consequently a rheostat for placental hormones
expressed from, or dependent on, the spongiotrophoblast, with ‘paternalisation’ increasing
their expression and ‘maternalisation’ decreasing expression.
To ask whether expression of Phlda2 in the offspring influenced maternal behaviour, we
exposed dams to three different doses of offspring Phlda2, excluding the confounder of geneti-
cally modified dams by using recipient transfer of embryos exclusively into WT females. All
experimental dams were generated by recipient transfer to control for any effect of this manip-
ulation on gene expression, and litters of comparable size were used throughout. We observed
changes in the maternal brain that preceded exposure to the pups and altered maternal behav-
iour after birth, consistent with our original hypothesis.
Results
Prenatal gene expression
Before undertaking a behavioural assessment, we asked whether changes were present in the
maternal brain during pregnancy. Preimplantation Phlda2+/+BACx1 (BAC transgenic overex-
pression; 2x), Phlda2+/+ (wild-type; 1x), and Phlda2−/+ (loss of function; 0x) embryos were
transferred into WT recipient females to generate WT(2x) (WT dams carrying and caring for
>60% Phlda2+/+BACx1 embryos), WT(1x) (WT dams carrying and caring for all WT embryos),
and WT(0x) (WT dams carrying and caring for all Phlda2−/+ embryos) dams, respectively (Fig
1A). After normalising for the number of foetuses per dam across the three groups (S2 Table),
and consistent with our previous data from naturally mated litters [41, 54], foetal growth was
reduced at E16.5 for both Phlda2+/+BACx1 (2x) and Phlda2-/+ (0x) foetuses carried by WT dams
in comparison to fully WT foetuses carried by WT dams (S3a Fig; S2 Table). Gene expression
in the maternal hypothalamus (onset, maintenance, and regulation of maternal behaviour)
and the hippocampus (memory, learning, and responses to fear and stress) [55] was assessed at
embryonic day (E) 16.5, 4 days before parturition at a time of maximal placental phenotype
[41, 54]. Heat maps were plotted for the genes that showed changes in expression levels at
p < 0.05. This resulted in a dendrogram grouping the WT(2x), WT(1x), and WT(0x) gene pro-
files by foetal Phlda2 dosage (Fig 1B). Two hundred ninety-six probes (0.79%) were altered
between WT(0x) and WT(2x) hypothalamus, and 1,333 probes (3.6%) were altered between
WT(0x) and WT(2x) hippocampus. Analysis of hypothalamic and hippocampal pathways
identified disturbances in olfactory transduction pathways important for maternal care and G

 protein–coupled receptor (GPCR) pathways through which neuropeptides and hormones
mediate their action (Fig 1C and 1D; S3 Fig). Specific to the hippocampus were disturbances
in the gonadotropin-releasing hormone signalling pathway, cell differentiation, and circadian
entrainment (Fig 1D). Together, these findings indicated a physiological response to the pla-
cental cues with potential for a behavioural response.
Following these encouraging findings, a second cohort of dams was generated by the same
protocol (Fig 2A) and allowed to deliver. As for the gene expression analysis, dams with small
litters (<6) were excluded to generate comparable litter sizes across the three groups (F2,

 36 = 0.83, p = 0.45; S2 Table; S2 Fig). Behaviour was assessed concurrently by the same team of
researchers between postnatal day (P) 2 and P4, when maternal behaviours are most intense in
rodents [56, 57].
To assess anxiety behaviour, we made use of the elevated plus maze (EPM) test on P2 (Fig
2A). Duration spent within the open and closed zones (F2, 36 = 1.44, p = 0.25) and frequency
of entry into each arm (F2, 36 = 1.7, p = 0.19) did not differ between cohorts. There was no
difference in time spent in the most anxiogenic open zone (F2, 36 = 0.16, p = 0.85). The total
distance moved within each zone was the same (F2, 36 = 1.58, p = 0.22), and there was no
difference between the speed of travel of the dams across the different zones (F2, 36 = 2.87,
p = 0.069). There were no differences in rearing (duration or frequency), stretch-attend (dura-
tion or frequency), or head-dips (duration or frequency) in any zone (data in S2 Table).
On P3, dams were tested on the pup-retrieval task after 24-hour acclimatisation in Phenoty-
per cages. The time taken by dams to first sniff their pups did not vary with Phlda2 dosage
(F2, 36 = 1.1, p = 0.33; Fig 2C), indicating intact response to olfactory cues. However, the time
taken to retrieve the first pup was different between the three groups (F2, 36 = 4.8, p = 0.015;
Fig 2C). WT(0x) dams who carried and cared for offspring with the lowest expression of
Phlda2 took 3 times longer to retrieve their first pup compared to either WT(1x) dams
(p = 0.01) or WT(2x) dams (p = 0.01; additional data in S2 Table).
Nocturnal behaviour
Lactating dams are usually more active during the dark phase [58], which was observed with
the WT(1x) dams exposed to the normal dose of Phlda2 (p < 0.001; Fig 2D). In contrast, nei-
ther WT(0x) (p = 0.83) nor WT(2x) (p = 0.13) dams showed a difference in activity between
light and dark phases. Although all three travelled similar distances over a 23-hour period
(36,022 versus 39,191 versus 39,542; WT[2x] versus WT[1x] versus WT[0x]; F2, 36 = 5.1,
p = 0.608), WT(0x) dams showed a tendency to be more active during the day, whereas WT
(2x) dams were less active at night (Fig 2D). The time dams spent in the nest during the light
phases was similar across the three cohorts (F2, 36 = 0.29, p = 0.75), but during the dark phase
(F1, 25 = 5.8, p = 0.024; Fig 2E), WT(0x) dams spent more time in the nest compared to WT
(1x) dams (p = 0.005; Fig 2E).
Nest building
Dams showed differences in nest building behaviour (F2,36 = 4.3, p = 0.022; Fig 2F). On P4,
WT(2x) dams were more effective at making nests and placing at least 1 pup in the nest than
either WT(1x) (p = 0.05) or WT(0x) dams (p = 0.03). WT(0x) dams were least effective in this
task, with only 1 WT(0x) dam building a nest and placing at least 1 pup within the nest during
the 60-minute test. Consistent with success rate in this task, there were differences across the
cohorts in time spent building nests (F2, 36 = 6.967, p = 0.003; Fig 2G), with WT(0x) dams
spending less time building nests than either WT(1x) (p = 0.029) or WT(2x) dams (p = 0.002).
Isolation-induced ultrasonic vocalisations (USVs) are known to stimulate maternal
behaviours such as nest building and pup retrieval [59, 60]. We found no difference between
Phlda2+/+ and Phlda2−/+ (KO) pup vocalisation at P2 or P4 that might explain delayed retrieval
or the failure to build nests (S4 Fig; data from naturally mated litters).

 Nursing and grooming
Pup retrieval and nest building are classic tests used to assess maternal behaviour but are not
necessarily indicators of enhanced maternal care. Dams normally divide their time between
nursing and grooming their pups (pup focused), maintaining themselves (self-directed), and
nondirected maternal behaviours (protection of the young, nest building). During the nest
building task, there is a conflict between these essential behaviours. Consistent with this con-
flict, during the task, there were differences in the duration and frequency of pup nursing (F2,
36 = 5.8, p = 0.007 and F2, 36 = 6.9, p = 0.003; Fig 3A). Dams exposed to the lowest dose of
Phlda2 (0x) engaged in crouched nursing for longer than dams exposed to the highest dose
(WT[0x] versus WT[2x]; p = 0.005 and p = 0.003; Fig 3A). The number of crouched nursing
events was greater for WT(0x) females, as was the number of passive nursing events (Fig 3A).
Both the duration (F2, 36 = 4.39, p = 0.02) and frequency (F2, 36 = 4.59, p = 0.017) of pup
grooming events was also different between the three groups (Fig 3B). WT(0x) dams spent 5
times longer grooming their pups (p = 0.02) and engaged in twice the number of grooming
events (p = 0.012) than WT(2x) dams. In addition to changes in pup-directed behaviour, dams
differed in both the duration (F2, 36 = 6.61, p = 0.004) and frequency (F2, 36 = 4.4, p = 0.02) of
self-grooming (Fig 3C). WT(0x) spent longer than either WT(1x) (p = 0.021) or WT(2x) dams
(p = 0.003) in self-grooming and engaged in self-grooming more frequently (p = 0.02 and
p = 0.01, respectively). WT(0x) dams travelled further during the nest building task (Fig 3D)

 and visited the food zone more often during the nest building task than dams exposed to
higher doses of Phlda2 (Fig 3E). Additional data are in S2 Table. As the dosage of Phlda2
decreased in the offspring, dams spent more time caring for their pups and maintaining them-
selves and less time on the ‘housekeeping’ task.
Pup welfare
Pup growth can be regarded as a measure of maternal care correlating with time spent nursing
and lactation. Phlda2+/+BACx1 and Phlda2−/+ foetuses were approximately 16% lighter than
Phlda2+/+ foetuses at E16.5 (S2 Fig). Pups were not weighed at birth to avoid disturbing the
dams in this critical period, but by P7, there was no difference in pup weight between the three
cohorts (F2, 164 = 1.89, p = 0.15; S2 Table). Adequate preweaning weight gain indicated that
the altered maternal behaviour did not negatively impact pup welfare, at least in the short
term.
Prenatal programming versus postnatal stimulation
Our understanding of the function of Phlda2 in placental endocrine lineage development
alongside alterations in the maternal brain that preceded exposure to the pups suggested the
prenatal programming of the behavioural changes. To test this theory, WT dams exposed in
utero to Phlda2−/+ (1x) or Phlda2−/+ (0x) embryos were provided with fully WT pups immedi-
ately after birth (Fig 4A), followed by an assessment of behaviours previously shown to be
altered in WT(0x) dams. Delayed retrieval was not different between the two groups (Fig 4B).
WT(0x)wt dams (WT dams carrying all Phlda2−/+ embryos and caring for all WT pups) were
less effective at nest building than WT(1x)wt dams (WT dams carrying all WT embryos and
caring for all WT pups from a different WT litter), despite a similar duration and number of
events (Fig 4C). Total number of nursing events was greater for WT(0x)wt dams (F1, 30 = 4.33,
p = 0.046), with arched nursing events showing the greatest difference between the two groups
(F1, 30 = 8.58, p = 0.006) (Fig 4D). Both the duration and number of pup grooming events by
WT(0x)wt dams were increased relative to WT(1x)wt dams (F1, 30 = 6.74, p = 0.014 and F1,
30 = 5.0, p = 0.033; Fig 4E). Self-grooming behaviour was similar between the two groups (Fig
4F). Additional data are in S3 Table.
Despite the significant disruption imposed by removing their own newborns and replac-
ing them with another dam’s newborns on the day of birth, WT(0x)wt dams retained their
enhanced nursing and grooming behaviours 4 days later. These data support prenatal pro-
gramming of at least some aspects of the maternal care phenotype. Moreover, replicating
our findings from the original experiment demonstrates that the phenotype is robustly
reproducible.
Discussion
Previous studies have shown that imprinted genes expressed in the dam are required for high-
quality maternal care provision [9–11]. Loss of expression of imprinted genes in the offspring
can also negatively influence maternal care postnatally through reduced demand for milk [61]
or reduced communication by the pups [12]. Here, we show that the offspring can influence
the maternal care they will receive even before they are born by modulating expression of the
imprinted Phlda2 gene in their placenta. Critically, this is a rare example of an alteration that
elicits enhanced care from the mother, reproducible over two independent studies. The direc-
tion of imprinting (paternalisation) supports our original hypothesis that silencing of Phlda2
in the male germline contributed to the evolution of enhanced maternal care in mammals.

 In mammals, male involvement in the care of young is rare, although not unknown [62],
because only females lactate, and internal fertilisation ensures maternity but not paternity.
Genomic conflict over maternal care predicts that ‘paternalisation’ should result in increased
maternal care, securing higher maternal investment [5]. However, this investment should not
come at a substantial cost to maternal well-being, as pups are dependent on the mother until
weaning. Consistent with this, we observed that ‘paternalised (0x)’ dams exposed to the lower
Phlda2 dose spent more time nursing and grooming their pups and more time on self-mainte-
nance behaviours than maternalised (2x) dams. Indeed, it may be that paternal silencing of
Phlda2 increases the fitness of the mothers, at least in the short term while caring for her litter.
Importantly, despite removing newborn pups from the nest and replacing them with WT
pups, paternalised (0x) dams retained their enhanced nurturing behaviour in the absence of

WT(1x) and WT(0x) dams were generated by recipient transfer. On day of delivery, WT pups born from WT(1x) dams were fostered to nonparental WT(1x) dams or
WT(0x) dams to generate WT(1x)wt (n = 15) and WT(0x)wt (n = 15) cohorts and left for 3 days to acclimatise in the home cage. (B) Pup retrieval in home cage on P3.

 continued exposure to genetically modified offspring 4 days later. Not only does this finding
support a prenatal mechanism, our ability to replicate findings at a different time and under
considerably more disruptive circumstances demonstrates the robustness of the phenotype. In
contrast, WT(2x) dams exposed to the higher dose of Phlda2 in their offspring spent less time
grooming and nursing their pups and less time on self-grooming. In most behaviours, WT(1x)
dams displayed either an intermediate phenotype or were similar to WT(2x) dams. Changes
in nurturing behaviour were subtle, and the decreased nurturing observed with WT(2x) dams
did not have an immediate impact on pup welfare. Following up the longer-term metabolic
and behavioural outcomes for the offspring will be required to fully establish the consequences
of decreased maternal care. Poor maternal care can be passed on [2, 63, 64], and it will be
equally interesting to ask whether the altered behaviour persists in subsequent pregnancies.
Maternal nurturing was increased in response to the lower dose of Phlda2, but WT(0x)
dams were slower to retrieve their first pup. Dams locate displaced pups through olfactory
and auditory cues. Dams from the three groups were equally effective at locating and sniffing
their pups, and Phlda2−/+ pups made normal USVs when separated from their mothers,
arguing against a major deficit in either medium. Rat dams can selectively retrieve the best-
developed pups of the litter [65]. Both Phlda2−/+ or Phlda2+/+BACx1 pups are growth restricted
at birth [41, 54], and the delay in WT(0x)wt dams retrieving the foster WT pups was not
statistically significant. It is possible that the quality of the offspring is responsible for the
observed delay in retrieval. WT(0x) females were less focused on nest building, spending a
shorter duration on this task, with fewer events and with only 1/13 females successfully
building a nest and placing at least 1 pup inside. In contrast, WT(2x) dams showed greater
focus on nest building, spending longer on this task, with an increased number of events
and 7/13 dams successfully completing the task, performing even better than WT(1x) dams.
When pups are displaced from the nest, dams normally rapidly return pups [66], with both
retrieval and nest building important for neonatal pup thermoregulation. Pup retrieval and
nest building are classically used to assess maternal behaviour, but these behaviours per se
are not necessarily an indicator of ‘good mothering’. During nest building, there is a conflict
between the time the dam spends on the nest and the time spent direct nurturing her pups
and herself. Although more elaborate nest building and pup retrieval are necessary aspects of
maternal behaviour, one interpretation is that paternalised (0x) dams are better mothers, as
they are more focused on direct nurturing.
The most simple explanation for our findings is that alterations in priming of mammary
development by placental lactogens drive increased or decreased milk availability, impacting
nursing behaviour with altered nest building as a secondary effect. However, dams with lacta-
tion deficits can initiate normal maternal behaviour [67, 68]. Moreover, changes in the dams’
hypothalamic and hippocampal transcriptomes were present 4 days before birth, indicating a
prenatal component. The programming of maternal behaviour during pregnancy requires
prolonged exposure to a number of hormones expressed from, or dependent on, the placenta.
Phlda2 plays a key role in restricting the expansion of the spongiotrophoblast, which is the
major endocrine cell type of the placenta [69]. Just 2-fold expression of Phlda2 prevents the
expansion of this lineage by 50%, with a concurrent decrease in the expression of spongiotro-
phoblast-expressed hormones, while loss of expression results in a 200% increase in spongio-
trophoblast and increased hormone expression [41]. Consistent with a direct action of
hormones on the maternal brain, analysis of hypothalamic and hippocampal pathways identi-
fied alterations in GPCR pathways through which neuropeptides and hormones mediate their
action. Olfactory transduction pathways important for maternal care [15, 70, 71] were altered
in both the maternal hippocampus and hypothalamus. Olfaction is important for pup recogni-
tion connected to the emotional system regulating social motor behaviour, which is initiated

 by odour, and the way in which positive signals of rewards are valued, which are important for
mother–pup bonding. The hippocampal olfactory circuit is linked to odour-guided learning
and memory, potentially also influencing mother–pup bonding. The gonadotropin-releasing
hormone signalling pathway altered in the hippocampus has been implicated in maternal care
and is known to respond to prolactin via this receptor [72, 73]. Placental lactogens have previ-
ously been implicated in the induction of maternal care [18], potentially via an interaction
with the prolactin receptor [22, 23], expressed in both the maternal hippocampus and hypo-
thalamus [74]. Together, these data suggest changes in the expression of one or more placental
lactogens contribute to the changes in behaviour we observe in our dams. In mice, there are 22
placenta-specific, Prl-related genes expressed from the trophoblast giant cells, spongiotropho-
blast, and glycogen cell lineages [16, 75]. Of these, Prl3d1 (PL-I) and Prl3b1 (PL-II) have been
shown formally to bind to the Prl receptor [21]. Prl3b1 is the dominant form during the sec-
ond half of pregnancy [76], and expression of this hormone is significantly affected by loss and
gain of the spongiotrophoblast mediated by Phlda2 [41, 53]. However, while it seems likely
that Phlda2 acts, at least in part, on maternal behaviour via regulating the production of
Prl3b1, given the complexity of maternal care, it is unlikely that Phlda2 functions via a single
hormone or pathway.
While we have not sought here to identify the specific hormone(s) that contributes to the
prenatal programming of maternal care, we have shown that imprinted genes can overcome
the rapid evolution of placental hormone gene families [77] by regulating the lineages that
express these hormones rather than directly regulating individual hormones, at least in mice.
The placenta is the most diverse organ in mammals [78, 79], and this phenomenon may not be
conserved across species. We have previously reported that in human pregnancies, placental
PHLDA2 expression is inversely correlated with maternal serum human placental lactogen
[80]. It remains to be seen if this relationship applies to other eutherian mammals.
In summary, our data provide further support for conflict related to pregnancy in mammals
[81] and the prediction that placental hormones (or genes that regulate placental hormones)
might be imprinted [82]. This is also a very rare, possibly unique, example of increased
maternal care prenatally programmed by a single gene modification in the offspring. Phlda2
acquired an imprinted status during the transition from a marsupial to eutherian mode of
reproduction [83], raising the intriguing possibility that imprinting of Phlda2 contributed to
increased maternal care during the evolution of mammals (Fig 5). As a final point, this study
may also have important implications for human health. Elevated placental PHLDA2 is a com-
mon findings in foetal growth restriction [84], which is associated with mood disorders in
human pregnancies [85]. It will be important to know whether human mothers carrying
infants with elevated placental PHLDA2 also show deficits in maternal behaviour.

 Fig 5. Phlda2 imprinting may have increased maternal care provision during the evolution of mammals. Phlda2 regulates the production of
placental hormones by controlling lineage allocation in the placenta. Decreasing Phlda2 expression through imprinting increases placental hormone
production, programming the mother to increase her focus on nurturing her young. Maternal silencing of Phlda2 occurred after marsupials diverged
from eutherian mammals more than 160 million years ago. Postpartum development in marsupials predominantly takes place in a pouch, with
maternal care being most prominent after the young leave the pouch. In contrast, the eutherian mother is primed during pregnancy to display
sophisticated maternal nurturing from birth, raising the intriguing possibility that imprinting of Phlda2 contributed to the evolution of maternal care in
mammals. Phlda2, pleckstrin homology-like domain family A member 2.

 maintained (>12 generations) and studied on the 129S2/SvHsd (129) strain background, with
control embryos and recipient females generated from a concurrently maintained, fully WT
129 colony. Embryos and pups were genotyped as previously described [52, 53].
Recipient transfer
To generate experimental dams, 5–7-week-old virgin female mice of the appropriate genotype
(Phlda2+/+, Phlda2−/−, or Phlda2+/+BACx1) were superovulated by 5 units (100 μl) intraperito-
neal pregnant mare serum followed by 5 units (100 μl) intraperitoneal human chorionic
gonadotropin 44–48 hours later, and mated with either WT or Phlda2+/+BACx1 stud males.
Embryos were flushed from oviducts in M2 media (Sigma) 2 days after a discernible plug on
E1.5 and incubated at 37 ˚C under 5% CO2 for 1–2 hours in KSOM (Specialty Media) before
14–16 embryos were transferred via bilateral oviduct transfer into E0.5 pseudopregnant WT
129 females aged 5–7 weeks. Phlda2+/+BACx1 animals carry a single copy of a nonimprinted
85-kb transgene spanning the genomic Phlda2 locus [54]. Homozygosity was found to be
unviable, and 2 heterozygous animals were mated to generate embryos with only litters with
>60% transgenic pups used in the downstream analysis. Pregnant females were either killed
at E16.5 or taken to term for the behavioural analysis. Day of delivery (D0) and litter size were
recorded. Dams with litter sizes between 6 and 12 live pups were used for analysis, and there
were no significant differences in litter size within any experiment (Data in S2 and S3 Tables).
All experimental samples were generated by recipient transfer.
Microarray
Dams were weighed and euthanised at E16.5 by cervical dislocation; whole brains were rapidly
removed, followed by fine dissection of the hypothalamus and hippocampus, which were rap-
idly frozen on dry ice. RNA was prepared by homogenisation in RNA-Bee (Ams Biotechnol-
ogy) following manufacturer’s instructions, and RNA concentration was evaluated using a
NanoDrop Spectrophotometer, with RNA concentration adjusted to approximately 1 μg/μl
using 10 mM Tris (pH 8). Gene expression analysis was performed using the Affymetrix Gene-
Chip Mouse Gene 2.0 ST Array. Microarray data analysis was performed using the R program-
ming language. Linear Model for Microarray data Analysis (LIMMA) was used to identify
differentially expressed (DE) genes between all pairwise comparisons across the sample groups
to generate heat maps of changes in gene expression levels at a p value <0.05. Pathway analysis
was performed using Database for Annotation Visualization and Integrated Discovery
(DAVID) and iPathwayGuide [86–88]. Impact analysis uses two types of evidence to define
the most greatly affected pathways affected in a system: (i) the overrepresentation of DE genes
in a given pathway and (ii) the perturbation of that pathway, computed by propagating the
measured expression changes across the pathway topology. The first probability, pORA,
expresses the probability of observing the number of DE genes in a given pathway that is
greater than or equal to the one observed by random chance. The second probability, pAcc,
was calculated based on the amount of total accumulation measured in each pathway. A per-
turbation factor was computed for each gene on the pathway. The two types of evidence,
pORA and pAcc, were combined into one final pathway score by calculating a p value using
Fisher’s method. This p value was then corrected for multiple comparisons using false discov-
ery rate (FDR) or Bonferroni corrections.
EPM
The EPM test was carried out on P2 when dams were in their home cage between 8:00 AM
and 10:00 AM hr to evaluate anxiety levels. Each new dam was given 10–15 minutes to

 habituate to the test room before embarking on the test away from her pups. The EPM
consisted of 2 opposite open arms and 2 opposite closed arms (19 cm × 8 cm × 15 cm;
length × width × height) elevated 1 metre above ground. The middle section that allows the
animal to transit from arm to arm consisted of a square with dimensions of 12 × 12 cm. Test-
ing was carried out under low light conditions (230 lux on open sections). Each mouse was
placed in the centre of the maze, and the amount of time spent in each arm was recorded auto-
matically by EthoVision XT 8.0 video tracking software (Noldus Information Technology,
Netherlands) over 5 minutes. Frequency and duration of rearing, stretch-attend, and head-
dips over the end or side of the open arms were recorded.
Pup retrieval
Pup retrieval and nest building took place on P3 between 8:00 AM and 10:00 AM after a
24-hour habitation period in the Phenotyper cage (Noldus, Netherlands). Cages were equipped
with cameras in the roof for video recording, and activity was tracked using Ethovision XT
software (Noldus Information Technology, Netherlands). The dam was removed from her
cage, and her pups were removed from the nest. Pups were placed at the opposite end of the
cage. The female was returned to her cage in the opposite corner to the pups and nest, and the
latency to sniff and then retrieve the first pup was recorded. Video recording was continued
for the following 23 hours before the nest building task, and videos were analysed by 2
researchers blind to the experimental groups.
Nest building
The quality of the nest building was scored on P4 between 8:00 AM and 10:00 AM. The Pheno-
typer recording was paused 23 hours into the recording. Dams, pups, and nests were removed
to the original home cage. A cardboard tube (International Product Supplies, UK) and 30 x 30
cm strips of tissue paper were placed in the Phenotyper cage, pups were placed next to the new
bedding material, dams were returned to the cage, and recording resumed for 1 hour. Nest
quality and presence of pups in the nest were scored from videos, using a simple scale of no
nest, nest built but no pups, or nest built and pups inside the nest, by 2 researchers blind to the
genotype of the pups. Distance moved during this trial and visits to virtual ‘zones’ were calcu-
lated automatically using Ethovision XT software. Behaviours scored were total, crouched,
arched, and passive nursing, grooming of pups, contacts with pups, self-grooming, and visits
to food hopper or water zone.
WT pup fostering
WT(1x) and WT(0x) dams were generated by recipient transfer by the same protocol used to
generate the original groups. Dams were checked every 6–8 hours from E19.5 for the presence
of pups. When newly born pups were found at the same time in both models, WT pups were
removed from their dams, and 6 WT pups were either fostered to a WT(0x) dam or to a differ-
ent WT(1x) dam (control). All litters were then left undisturbed in Phenotypers until testing
from P3.
USV recording
USV was performed on fully WT pups and fully Phlda2−/− pups on P2 in a separate cohort gen-
erated by natural mating. The dam’s litter was removed from the home cage and placed in a
separate home cage. USVs made by the pups were recorded for 180 seconds using Avisoft-
UltraSoundGate 116Hb (Avisoft Bioacoustics e.K., Germany).
