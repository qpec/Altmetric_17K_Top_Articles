Flamingos (Phoenicopteridae) often stand and sleep on one leg for long
periods, but it is unknown how much active muscle contractile force they
use for the mechanical demands of standing on one leg: body weight support
and maintaining balance. First, we demonstrated that flamingo cadavers could
passively support body weight on one leg without any muscle activity while
adopting a stable, unchanging, joint posture resembling that seen in live
flamingos. By contrast, the cadaveric flamingo could not be stably held in a
two-legged pose, suggesting a greater necessity for active muscle force to
stabilize two-legged versus one-legged postures. Our results suggest that
flamingos engage a passively engaged gravitational stay apparatus (proxi-
mally located) for weight support during one-legged standing. Second, we
discovered that live flamingos standing on one leg have markedly reduced
body sway during quiescent versus alert behaviours, with the point of force
application directly under the distal joint, reducing the need for muscular
joint torque. Taken together, our results highlight the possibility that flamin-
gos stand for long durations on one leg without exacting high muscular
forces and, thus, with little energetic expenditure.
1. Introduction
Why do flamingos stand on one leg? Flamingos are thought to stand on one leg
to reduce muscle fatigue [1] or heat loss [1,2]. The muscle fatigue hypothesis
assumes that standing for long periods requires sufficiently high levels of
active contractile force that would fatigue muscle, necessitating alternating
stance from one leg to the other. Conversely, the heat loss hypothesis assumes
that the energetic cost of activating muscles for the one-legged stance is smaller
than any heat savings realized. While increased energy cost for generating
muscle contractile forces [3] could negate any benefits from reducing muscle
fatigue or heat loss, whether high levels of muscle activity are required for a
flamingo to stand on one leg is unknown.
Here, we examined whether it is possible for flamingos to stand on one leg
with minimal active muscle forces. We investigated two aspects of postural
stability that can exact high muscle forces: body weight support and maintaining
balance. To our knowledge, this is the first functional investigation of one-legged
standing in flamingos to explore both musculoskeletal anatomy and behaviour.
Using cadaveric manipulation, we tested whether a passive stabilizing
mechanism, or stay apparatus [4,5], in the proximal joints could allow flamin-
gos to maintain a one-legged postural configuration without active muscle
force. Although flamingos often sleep standing on one leg, there has been no
direct evidence that they can passively support body weight. The horizontally
oriented femur [6,7] requires large knee and hip joint moments to support body
weight and creates a poor effective mechanical advantage [8] for proximal
muscles (figure 1a–c; see the electronic supplementary material).

 We also measured balance behaviours in live flamingos
standing on one leg. We characterized the location of force
application under the foot and postural sway dynamics across
quiescent and active conditions. These data provide important
behavioural descriptions necessary to generate further hy-
potheses regarding the active and passive mechanisms used
in the one-legged stance by flamingos.
2. Material and methods
(a) Cadaver experiments
Two fresh-frozen adult Caribbean flamingo cadavers (Phoenicop-
terus ruber) were obtained from Birmingham Zoo (Birmingham,
AL, USA). We performed kinematics analyses and dissections
on fully thawed specimens. Two adjustable bone clamps
attached to a vertical strut held the cadaver by one leg at the
distal tibiotarsus, emulating a one-legged stance. We tilted
the body forwards and backwards in the sagittal plane while
tracking limb segment markers to calculate knee and hip joint
angles (30 Hz, Dartfish).
(b) Live bird experiments
Over eight sessions, we collected ground reaction components and
reference video on eight juvenile Chilean flamingos (Phoenicopterus
chilensis) at Zoo Atlanta (Atlanta, GA, USA; mass: 0.25–1.40 kg, leg
length: 0.17–0.40 m) as they stood on a force plate (200 Hz, AMTI
HE6X6). Trials included visibly active (eyes open) and quiescent

 (eyes closed) birds standing on one and two legs. We digitized toe
positions from video and computed the centre of pressure (CoP)
location on the force plate surface (Matlab, Mathworks). For each
trial, we calculated the 95% confidence radius of CoP excursion
from a mean location and peak CoP velocity. We characterized
CoP dynamics as a bounded random walk by plotting mean
squared displacement Dx2 versus time interval Dt over 0–10 s inter-
vals. Here, Dx2 ¼ 2DDt describes a random walk with diffusion
constant D [9]. For each trial, we fit Dx2 versus Dt to an equa-
tion Dx2 ¼ A(1 2 e2aDt), depicting the Dx2 upper bound and
exponential time constant a (goodness of fit: r2 ¼ 0.97+0.03).
3. Results and discussion
We observed that flamingo functional anatomy can passively
generate proximal joint moments for bodyweight support on
one leg. In a one-legged pose, the force of bodyweight engaged
the cadaver’s proximal joints into a fixed joint configuration
visually resembling live flamingos standing on one leg.
The joints largely remained fixed as the tibiotarsus was tilted
forwards and backwards through 1198 in the sagittal plane
(hip: 13.9+5.78, knee: 104.5+5.48; figure 1d; see electronic
supplementary material, movie S1). Upon physical manipu-
lation, the knee joint resisted extension, but not flexion,
suggesting a unidirectional stay apparatus in the proximal
limb. Little joint movement (less than 108) occurred when we
applied a downward force (approx. 5–108 N) on the body
anterior to the knee, consistent with the effect of gravity on
the centre of mass. A downward force applied posteriorly
near the tail, however, caused the body to pitch backwards
(see electronic supplementary material, movie S1).
We found that a stable joint configuration could only be
achieved when placing the cadaver such that the foot was
directly beneath the body, as adopted in one-legged standing.
For example, joint configuration remained fixed when the
tibiotarsus was adducted 208 from vertical in the frontal
plane. When aligned vertically, approximating a two-legged
stance, the joints rapidly became unstable and could no
longer support the body weight (electronic supplementary
material, movie S1). This suggests that the unidirectional stay
apparatus is engaged only within a small range of frontal
plane angles compared with a 1198 range in the sagittal plane.
We identified three
biomechanical conditions
for a
unidirectional, passively engaged gravitational stay in one-
legged standing flamingos. First, having the body centre of
mass located anterior to the knee joint generates passive grav-
itational knee extensor and hip flexor moments (electronic
supplementary material, movie S1). Second, anatomical
range of motion limits in the knee and hip oppose these grav-
itational moments to constrain joint configuration. Third, the
foot must be placed medially to the hip joint in the frontal
plane to engage and maintain this joint configuration (elec-
tronic supplementary material, movie S1). If any conditions
are not met, the system reverts to a three-link, open kinematic
chain with free joint movement. Previously identified bony
and cartilaginous morphological structures at the hip [10]
and knee [11,12] may play an important role in the kinematic
constraints of this stay apparatus (electronic supplementary
material, figures S3 and S4). Regardless of the specific joint
articulations, however, the functional anatomical interactions
create biomechanical conditions for passive body weight
support in the proximal limb during the one-legged stance.
What are the characteristics of one-legged balance in living
flamingos, and could they be achieved through active versus
passive mechanisms? In quiescent birds (eyes closed), CoP
movements were remarkably small and located directly
under the tarsometatarsophalangeal (TMP) joint (figure 2a).
The body was in a resting posture, similar to what we observed
in the upright cadaveric specimen. The point of force appli-
cation directly under the joint requires little to no net joint
torque about the TMP joint. In a notable 20 min continuous
trial, a flamingo stood on one leg, initially awake (eyes open)

(d) When alert (eyes open) and moving (grooming and shaking), the CoP displacement radius doubled (6.0 mm). Peak CoP velocity (362 mm s21) was more than
11-fold greater and the RMS CoP velocity (48 mm s21) increased more than sevenfold.

 and then became quiescent, possibly falling asleep (eyes closed;
electronic supplementary material, movie S2). During this
quiescent state, the CoP location was maintained in a small
radius under the TMP joint (figure 2b). By contrast, when
awake (eyes open) in the resting posture, and demonstrably
active (grooming, shaking and vocalizing), there were large,
rapid CoP movements (figure 2c,d). When quiescent, the
CoP stayed within a 95% confidence radius ¼ 3.2+0.5 mm
(5–10% foot length); this increased to 5.1+0.4 mm when
active ( p , 0.01). The larger and persistent CoP deviations
away from its location beneath the TMP joint were only seen
in awake and active conditions and require larger net torque
about the TMP joint. Peak CoP velocity doubled when awake
(79+1 mm s21) versus quiescent (40+19 mm s21, p , 0.01),
and
increased

in

conditions
(296+
15 mm s21, p , 0.01, figure 2d). CoP diffusion dynamics,
characterized by the mean squared distance over the same
time constant in both activity levels (p . 0.7), was lower
when quiescent (1.7+0.7 mm2) versus active (4.5+0.6 mm2;
p , 0.05). Our results show that the balance behaviour of a
quiescent flamingo standing on one leg is consistent with
that of a vertical, balanced inverted pendulum, which is achiev-
able with little muscle activity. This observation is consistent
with the idea that flamingos could maintain balance with
little to no muscle activity when asleep, although from behav-
ioural data we cannot rule out the possibility that high tonic
levels of muscle coactivity are used to maintain balance. The
CoP motion in active conditions could be due either to active
balance corrections during movement, or to passive stabiliz-
ation mechanisms. Direct measurement of muscle activity
during one-legged standing, perhaps in a more tractable bird
species, is needed to fully resolve these issues.
Our results suggest that muscle activity could be lower in
a one-legged than in a two-legged standing posture due to
the engagement of a unidirectional, passive, gravitational
stay apparatus, and the tightly localized point of force appli-
cation under the TMP joint during quiescent one-legged
standing. Although passive digital locks have been found in
distal segments of perching birds [13] and hanging bats [14],
this is the first demonstration, to our knowledge, of a passive,
gravity-driven body weight support mechanism in the proxi-
mal joints of a bird. Further, as we did not observe large
postural sway when standing on one leg, there may also be
passive mechanisms for balance, which may be particularly
important during sleep. In horses, muscle forces in sleep-stand-
ing are reduced by approximately 98% via passive mechanisms
[4,5,15]. As flamingos primarily use their legs for prolonged
standing [16] and not locomotion, it seems likely that
one-legged standing should be energetically efficient. Other
ancillary benefits for the one-legged stance, such as reduced
heat loss [2,17–19], may not be as important for non-aquatic
and tropical birds that also stand on one leg [1]. We therefore
propose the hypothesis that rather than to reduce muscle fati-
gue or heat loss, flamingos stand on one leg to reduce
muscular energy expenditure. While we lack direct evidence,
reduced energy expenditure could more generally explain
how many birds with varied morphologies and ecological
niches can benefit from this uniquely avian behaviour.
