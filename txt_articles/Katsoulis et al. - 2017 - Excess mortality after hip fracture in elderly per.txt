elderly persons from Europe and the USA: the
CHANCES project. J Intern Med 2017; 281: 300–
310.
Background. Hip fractures are associated with dimin-
ished quality of life and survival especially amongst
the elderly.
Objective. All-cause mortality after hip fracture was
investigated to assess its magnitude.
Methods. A total of 122 808 participants from eight
cohorts in Europe and the USA were followed up for
a mean of 12.6 years, accumulating 4273 incident
hip fractures and 27 999 deaths. Incident hip
fractures
were
assessed
through
telephone
interviews/questionnaires or national inpatient/
fracture registries, and causes of death were ver-
ified with death certificates. Cox proportional haz-
ards
models
and
the
time-dependent
variable
methodology were used to assess the association
between hip fracture and mortality and its magni-
tude at different time intervals after the injury in
each cohort. We obtained the effect estimates
through a random-effects meta-analysis.
Results. Hip fracture was positively associated with
increased all-cause mortality; the hazard ratio (HR)
in the fully adjusted model was 2.12, 95% confi-
dence interval (CI) 1.76–2.57, after adjusting for
potential confounders. This association was stron-
ger amongst men [HR: 2.39, 95% CI: 1.72–3.31]
than amongst women [HR: 1.92, 95% CI: 1.54–
2.39], although this difference was not significant.
Mortality was higher during the first year after the
hip fracture [HR: 2.78, 95% CI: 2.12–3.64], but it
remained elevated without major fluctuations after
longer time since hip fracture [HR (95% CI): 1.89
(1.50–2.37) after 1–4 years; 2.15 (1.81–2.55) after
4–8 years; 1.79 (1.57–2.05) after 8 or more years].
Conclusion. In this large population-based sample of
older persons across eight cohorts, hip fracture
was associated with excess short- and long-term
all-cause mortality in both sexes.

Original Article
 Introduction
As the population ages, bone fractures are becom-
ing
an
increasingly
important
health
problem
amongst the elderly with substantial burden for
the individual and society. Hip fractures are the
most relevant fractures in terms of severity, func-
tional dependence, social and economic cost and
fatality [1–3].
Despite a well-known increase in mortality shortly
after hip fracture [3–5], the evidence on the long-
term mortality following a hip fracture is not
consistent
[6–11].
Some
studies
have
demon-
strated a persistent increase in all-cause mortality
in the long term after the injury [6–9], whereas
others report from low to no elevated long-term
mortality after hip fracture [10, 11]. The higher
mortality rates were mostly observed in elderly, ill
or impaired populations [6, 7]. A recent meta-
analysis exploring the magnitude and duration of
excess mortality risk after hip fracture found the
highest risk in the first 3 months after the fracture
(fivefold
to
eightfold
increase),
and
mortality
remained elevated, compared to age-matched con-
trols,
even
after
10 years.
The
excess
risk
increased with age and, at any given age, was
higher for men than for women [12].
The aim of this study was to investigate both short-
and long-term mortality after hip fracture in a large
cohort of community dwellers, aged 60 years and
older, from Europe and the USA who were followed
up prospectively.
Materials and methods
The CHANCES project
The Consortium on Health and Ageing: Network of
Cohorts in Europe and United States (CHANCES)
project is a large collaboration, funded by the
European Commission within the Seventh Frame-
work Programme, combining 14 major cohorts/
studies from Europe and the USA, to provide
evidence on ageing-related health characteristics
and determinants of healthy ageing. The study
protocol of each individual cohort/study has been
approved
by
local
ethics
committees,
and
all
participants have given written informed consent
before enrolment. All procedures have been car-
ried out in accordance with the Declaration of
Helsinki. Variables were harmonized across the
cohorts following predetermined standardized pro-
cedures.
The
study
design
and
population
characteristics of the cohorts included in the
CHANCES project have been described in detail
elsewhere [13].
Eight cohorts with available information on hip
fractures during follow-up as well as mortality
were
included
in
the
present
analysis:
EPIC-
Elderly Greece and EPIC-Elderly Ume�
a, Sweden
[14]; the ESTHER (Epidemiological Study on the
Chances of Prevention, Early Recognition and
Optimised Treatment of Chronic Diseases in the
Older Population) Study from Germany [15]; the
Tromsø Study from Norway [16]; the Swedish
Mammography Cohort (SMC) and the Cohort Of
Swedish Men (COSM) studies [17]; the Nurses’
Health Study (NHS) from the USA [18]; and the
Health, Alcohol and Psychosocial factors in East-
ern Europe (HAPIEE) study with data from the
Czech
Republic
[19].
Further
details
about
the
participating
cohorts
are
available
in
the
Appendix S1.
Information on incident hip fractures
Information on incident hip fractures was collected
through telephone interviews or questionnaires to
elicit self-reported data in EPIC-Elderly Greece,
ESTHER and NHS and through national inpatient
registries or fracture registries in EPIC-Elderly
Ume�
a, the Tromsø Study, COSM, SMC and the
Czech HAPIEE cohort [16, 20]. To verify self-
reported hip fractures, validation studies were
conducted for EPIC-Elderly Greece and ESTHER
in the context of the CHANCES project. The rate of
verification ranged from 52% to 86%. A validation
study was also conducted as part of the NHS in
which all self-reported hip fractures were con-
firmed by medical records [21], whilst COSM,
SMC and the Tromsø Study had shown high
validity of incident hip fracture diagnosis using
the national inpatient register [20, 22]. Hip frac-
tures identified as International Classification of
Diseases and Related Health Problems 10th Revi-
sion (ICD-10) codes S72.0–S72.2 were included in
the analyses.
Information on all-cause mortality
Vital status of the participants was assessed either
by contacting relatives or household members, or
through record linkage with nationwide or local
death registries. All causes of death were verified
through death certificates, whereas ICD coding
was used across the cohorts.

 Statistical analysis
Individual cohorts
To describe the socio-economic, lifestyle, medical
and anthropometric characteristics of the partici-
pants, the distribution of the corresponding vari-
ables, separately for men and women in every
cohort, is presented. Cox regression was applied
for the cohort-specific analyses to calculate hazard
ratios (HRs) and 95% confidence intervals (95%
CIs) for mortality following the occurrence of a hip
fracture event. The survival time was calculated
from the date of enrolment in the study until the
date of death (for those who died during follow-up)
or the date of last follow-up (for those who were
alive at that time). Once the exposure of interest in
this study was the hip fracture event, which
occurred during follow-up, we treated hip fracture
as a time-dependent variable to capture the asso-
ciation between hip fracture and mortality. The
same methodology was used to assess the afore-
mentioned association at different time intervals
from the beginning of the hip fracture event.
Models were applied with three levels of adjust-
ment with an increasing number of confounders.
Specifically, model 1 was only adjusted for age (in
years; continuous variable) and sex. Model 2 was
additionally adjusted for the continuous variables;
body mass index (BMI) (in kg m�2), height (in m),
daily energy intake (in kcal day�1) and alcohol
intake (in g day�1) and the categorical variables;
vigorous physical activity (yes/no), educational
level (none/less than primary/vocational or tech-
nical secondary/secondary, not vocational and not
technical/college or university), living alone (yes;
for single, widowed, separated or divorced/no; for
married or living together), employment status
(full-time or part-time employment and not of
pensionable age/self-employment/housewife and
not of pensionable age/pensionable age and still
working/pensionable
age
and
not
working/
stopped working before retirement age due to poor
health/unemployed and not of pensionable age)
and smoking status (never/former/current smo-
ker). Finally, model 3 was additionally adjusted for
hypertension (yes/no) and chronic diseases (car-
diovascular disease, diabetes or cancer; yes/no).
After following a consistent harmonization proce-
dure [13], there were minor differences in the
definitions of variables used; the following variables
were not available in all cohorts and were not
included in the analysis for specific studies: alcohol
intake (many missing values in the Tromsø Study),
energy intake (not available in the Tromsø Study
and ESTHER), education (all participants in NHS
educated to the same level), prevalent cancers
(excluded in COSM at baseline), living alone (not
available in SMC), vigorous physical activity (not
available
in
EPIC-Sweden)
and
prevalent
hip
fractures (not available in EPIC-Greece and EPIC-
Sweden). Moreover, educational level was used in
three levels in the Tromsø Study (primary or less/
high school or lyceum/college or university).
Participants aged ≥60 years at enrolment without a
prevalent hip fracture event were included in the
present analysis. Model 3 was chosen as the main
(fully adjusted) model. We excluded from our
analyses those participants without any follow-up
or with missing values in variables included in
Model 3. We performed three further subanalyses
restricted to (i) men, (ii) women and (iii) subjects
aged ≥70 years at enrolment.
We also tried to assess interaction on an additive
scale between hip fractures and other risk factors
using the relative excess risk due to interaction
(RERI) index [23]:
RERI ¼ ðk11 � k10 � k01 þ k00Þ=k00; where
k11=hazard rate when hip fracture and the other
risk factor are present; k10=hazard rate when hip
fracture is present and the other risk factor is
absent;
k01=hazard
rate
when
hip
fracture
is
absent
and
the
other
risk
factor
is
present;
k00=hazard rate when hip fracture and the other
risk factor are absent.
In other words:
RERI ¼ HR11 � HR10 � HR01 þ 1; where
HR11=hazard ratio when hip fracture and the other
risk factor are present; HR10=hazard ratio when
hip fracture is present and the other risk factor is
absent; HR01=hazard ratio when hip fracture is
absent and the other risk factor is present.
All cohort-specific analyses were carried out using
STATA statistical software versions 10–13 (Stata
Corp LP, College Station, TX, USA).
Meta-analysis
All meta-analyses of cohort-specific estimates were
performed using the DerSimonian–Laird method
with random effects [24]. We estimated the HRs

 and 95% CIs for mortality following hip fracture
events,
after
combining all results
from
each
cohort
separately.
The
heterogeneity
between
cohorts was measured using the I2 statistic and
tested for statistical significance with the chi-
squared
test
from
Cochran’s
Q
statistic
[25].
Moreover, we tested effect modification with a
meta-analysis of all available estimates from dif-
ferent strata by calculating the chi-squared test for
heterogeneity.
For the meta-analysis of interaction on the additive
scale, we calculated the RERI (index of interest) in
all cohorts and then performed a meta-analysis of
these indices.
For all meta-analyses, we used STATA, version 11
(Stata Corp LP). All tests were two-sided, and
P-values less than 0.05 were considered statisti-
cally significant.
Results
The study population consisted of 122 808 partic-
ipants from eight cohorts (seven from Europe and
one from the USA); during a mean follow-up time of
12.6 years (range 7.9–13.7 years), there were 4273
incident hip fractures. Participants were mostly
recruited during the 1990s, and a total of 27 999
participants died during follow-up (Table 1). The
percentage of hip fracture varied from 1.2% to
10.3%. Once all participants were at least 60 years
old, small age differences were observed amongst
the cohorts. The percentage of participants with
one or more missing values for any of the variables
included in the analysis varied from 8% to 44%
across the cohorts; however, the distribution of the
variables in each cohort before and after exclusions
was
essentially
the
same
(see
Appendix
S1).
The baseline characteristics of the study partici-
pants are presented by sex and cohort in Tables 2A
and B.
Table 3 and Fig. 1 show that the occurrence of hip
fracture was positively associated with all-cause
mortality (in model 3: HR 2.12, 95% CI: 1.76–2.57)
after adjusting for all available potential con-
founders. After excluding HAPIEE from the analy-
sis due to the exceptionally high HR, overall
associations decreased but remained statistically
significant (in model 3: HR 1.98, 95% CI: 1.65–
2.38). The association between hip fracture and
mortality slightly decreased after adjusting for
increasing number of confounders (i.e. from model
1 to model 3). Model 3 showed that this relation-
ship was somewhat stronger amongst men (HR
2.39, 95% CI: 1.72–3.31) than women (HR 1.92
(95% CI: 1.54–2.39), and was weaker but still
significant amongst participants aged ≥70 years
old (HR 1.84, 95% CI: 1.46–2.33), as the underly-
ing risk of these (more elderly) participants is
higher. When a sensitivity analysis was applied
restricting the analysis to cohorts that included
both
sexes,
the
differences
remained

 unchanged and statistically significant (in model 3:
HR 2.37 and 1.94 for men and women, respec-
tively). By contrast, when the association amongst
participants aged ≥70 years was compared with
the association in the primary analysis of partici-
pants ≥60 years, after excluding EPIC-Sweden,
NHS and HAPIEE which do not contribute to the
HR of subjects aged ≥70 years old (because they
have very few or no participants in this age group at
baseline), the difference was small [in model 3: HR
1.91 and 1.84 for all participants (≥60 years old)
and those ≥70 years old, respectively]. Although
the heterogeneity of the associations was high in all
these comparisons (in general: 70% ≤ I2 ≤ 90%),
the relationship between hip fracture and mortality
was
positive
in
all
countries,
but
differed
in
magnitude (Fig. 1).
Although the proportionality assumption was not
violated in any of the cohorts, we also estimated the
time-dependent effect of hip fracture on mortality
(Table 4). We found that the short-term effect of hip
fractures was higher than the mid- and long-term
effects. Specifically, the HR in the first year after
hip fracture was 2.78 (95% CI: 2.12–3.64), whereas
in the longer term hip fractures were associated
with an almost twofold increase in mortality (1–
4 years after hip fracture: HR 1.89, 95% CI: 1.50–
2.37; 4–8 years after hip fracture: HR 2.15, 95%
CI: 1.81–2.55; and ≥8 years after hip fracture: HR
1.79, 95% CI: 1.57–2.05). In this analysis, we
considered the effects of all cohorts for all time
periods, except HAPIEE, which does not contribute
to
the
overall
HR
for
≥8 years.
However,
the
conclusions were unchanged when we excluded
the HAPIEE cohort from this entire analysis (data
not shown).
Finally, we found that the associations between the
combination of hip fracture and prevalent chronic
disease
and
mortality
were
super-additive
(RERI > 0), as evidenced by a 42% (95% CI: 10–
75%) excess risk of mortality due to the joint
presence
of
hip
fracture
and
chronic
disease
(Fig. 2). When we investigated any possible excess
risk due to the interaction between hip fracture
and obesity and living alone, we found no signifi-
cant deviation from additivity.

observed according to sex, with the magnitude
of the increase in all-cause mortality somewhat
larger amongst men. Associations were signifi-
cant even after controlling for chronic comor-
bidities
and
lifestyle
factors.
Furthermore,
prevalence of chronic diseases at baseline was
found to have a super-additive effect with hip
fractures on mortality (as tested using the RERI
index), implying that individuals with chronic
diseases need particularly careful management
following a hip fracture.

hip fracture and mortality in elderly persons
ª 2017 The Association for the Publication of the Journal of Internal Medicine

Journal of Internal Medicine, 2017, 281; 300–310
 Our results with respect to short-term excess all-
cause mortality confirm those of other studies and
the most recent meta-analysis (almost threefold
increase in the present study compared to three-
fold to fivefold increase during the first 6 months in
the recent meta-analysis) [5, 9, 12]. To the best of
our knowledge, excess short-term mortality follow-
ing
hip
fracture,
especially
during
the
first
3–6 months, was observed in all previously pub-
lished studies. Factors that contribute the most to
this finding are linked to postoperative complica-
tions after surgery such as cardiac and pulmonary
complications, infections (e.g. pneumonia and sep-
ticaemia) and increased risk of thromboembolism
[26, 27]. Other factors, such as multiple comorbid
conditions, have also been implicated [12, 25].
A difference in excess all-cause mortality after hip
fracture amongst men and women, and specifically
a higher excess mortality amongst men, although
minimal in this study, has been a consistent
finding in previous studies [5, 12, 27–29]. It seems
that although hip fracture incidence in men is
substantially lower compared to women, mortality
after hip fracture is higher in men [29]. Efforts to
explore further the causes of this gender difference
have shown, in most instances, that such differ-
ences remained even after controlling for chronic
comorbidities and medications [28].
Long-term mortality after hip fracture was signif-
icantly elevated, not only for the first 8 years, but
also after that period. The excess long-term risk of
death after hip fracture has been found in the
majority but not all relevant studies; however, the
mechanisms underlying this excess risk remain
unclear [6–11]. One explanation has been the co-
existence of chronic disease, but excess mortality
remained in the studies that collected and had the
ability to adjust for such data [4, 6, 7, 12]. On the
other
hand,
hip
fracture
is
associated
with
increased functional decline and disability in the
elderly [30]. Recently, hip fracture occurrence has
also been associated with an exaggerated persis-
tent inflammatory response, whilst, in parallel,
chronic inflammation might play a role in the
functional decline and the onset or acceleration of
frailty [31–33]. These mechanisms could provide a
possible explanation of the observed decline in
health and the increased long-term mortality after
hip fracture. In addition, the detrimental effect of
long-standing pain and diminished quality of life,
especially when followed by loss of independence,
should not be underestimated [34].
The strengths of our study include the large,
population-based sample of more than 100 000
elderly participants from Europe and the USA, the
prospective design, the use of harmonized vari-
ables across the cohorts and the implementation of
a common statistical analysis with individual data.
The meta-analysis of harmonized individual data
possibly
reduced
the
potential
heterogeneity,
which generally occurs when performing a meta-
analysis of published data. Moreover, by meta-
analysing results from different cohorts without
knowing a priori the associations that would be
estimated, we have overcome the problem of pub-
lication bias [35] that may be present in other
meta-analyses of previous publications [12].
A limitation of this study is the different periods of
enrolment of the participants in the cohorts as both
life expectancy and some aspects of hip fracture
treatment
have
changed
during
these
years.
Although the majority of participants entered the
studies during the 1990s, subjects were also
recruited during the late 1980s to the NHS and
during
the
2000s
to
the
NHS,
ESTHER
and
HAPIEE-Czech.
Nevertheless,
although
hetero-
geneity was observed between cohorts (perhaps
partially explained by the different periods of
recruitment of the participants in the cohorts along
with the fact that participants had different char-
acteristics across cohorts; see Tables 1 and 2 A
and B), the association between hip fracture and
subsequent mortality showed the same positive
direction in all cohorts. Moreover, heterogeneity
decreased according to the period after hip frac-
ture, possibly due to the decreased number of
events (deaths) over time. Furthermore, we could
not determine the cause of hip fracture; more
specifically,
we
were
not
able
to
differentiate
between high-energy (e.g. traffic accidents) and
low-energy trauma (e.g. falls from standing height),
although the majority of hip fractures in older
subjects (≥60 years of age) are low-energy frac-
tures. The different methods of hip fracture and
mortality ascertainment used across the partici-
pating cohorts could potentially have resulted in
differing degrees of under- and over-reporting of
hip fracture cases and deaths that could further
influence
the
association
under
study.
Also,
although extensive harmonization was undertaken
in the context of the CHANCES project, different
methods of data collection were used, and not all
covariates were assessed in all cohorts. Residual
confounding may also exist because of the inability
to control for other parameters such as medication
M. Katsoulis et al.
hip fracture and mortality in elderly persons

 (e.g. bisphosphonates), supplement use and access
to health care across the cohorts. Additionally,
covariates such as BMI, alcohol intake, physical
activity and comorbidities were assessed at base-
line
and
not
updated
during
follow-up.
It
is
unlikely, however, that such changes in the covari-
ates would have had a major impact on the results.
Information on nursing home status at the time of
hip fracture was not available, and thus, we could
not differentiate between nursing home residents
and community-dwelling participants in our anal-
yses. Nursing home residents have been shown to
experience higher mortality in comparison with
community dwellers both amongst individuals with
hip fracture, especially in the immediate postinjury
period, and amongst those without hip fracture
[36]. The magnitude of missing data could have
affected our findings. However, the extent would be
small as there was no significant difference in the
characteristics of the available participants and of
those included in the analysis (see Appendix S1).
Finally, the findings of this study cannot be
extrapolated to populations other than white men
and women aged ≥60 years with similar sociode-
mographic characteristics to those of the study
participants.
Conclusions
In conclusion, our study confirms that elderly
individuals who have suffered a hip fracture are
at increased risk of dying, compared to those who
have not, in the short term after the fracture but
also years later. Appropriate measures need to be
implemented for primary and secondary preven-
tion of hip fracture in order to ensure better quality
of life and survival in the elderly.
