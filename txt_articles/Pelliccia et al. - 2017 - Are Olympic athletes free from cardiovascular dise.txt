ABSTRACT
Context Olympic athletes represent model of success in
our society, by enduring strenuous conditioning
programmes and achieving astonishing performances.
They also raise scientific and clinical interest, with regard
to medical care and prevalence of cardiovascular (CV)
abnormalities.
Objective Our aim was to assess the prevalence and
type of CV abnormalities in this selected athlete’s
cohort.
Design, setting and participants 2352 Olympic
athletes, mean age 25±6, 64% men, competing in 31
summer or 15 winter sports, were examined with
history, physical examination, 12-lead and exercise ECG
and echocardiography. Additional testing (cardiac MRI,
CT scan) or electrophysiological assessments were
selectively performed when indicated.
Main outcome measures Prevalence and type of CV
findings, abnormalities and diseases found in Olympic
athletes over 10 years.
Results A subset of 92 athletes (3.9%) showed
abnormal CV findings. Structural abnormalities included
inherited cardiomyopathies (n=4), coronary artery
disease (n=1), perimyocarditis (n=4), myocardial bridges
(n=2), valvular and congenital diseases (n=45) and
systemic hypertension (n=10). Primary electrical diseases
included atrial fibrillation (n=2), supraventricular
reciprocating tachycardia (n=14), complex ventricular
tachyarrhythmias (non-sustained ventricular tachycardia,
n=7; bidirectional ventricular tachycardia, n=1) or major
conduction disorders (Wolff-Parkinson-White (WPW),
n=1; Long QT syndrome (LQTS), n=2).
Conclusions Our study revealed an unexpected
prevalence of CV abnormalities among Olympic athletes,
including a small, but not negligible proportion of
pathological conditions at risk. This observation suggests
that Olympic athletes, despite the absence of symptoms
or astonishing performances, are not immune from CV
disorders and might be exposed to unforeseen high-risk
during sport activity.
INTRODUCTION
Olympic athletes represent a unique subset of the
athletic population by virtue of their motivation to
excel, strenuous exercise conditioning and astonish-
ing performances. Participating and succeeding in
Olympic Games represents the highest achievement
in the athlete’s career, and the way to gather large
visibility, social fame and economic success. It is a
fact that Olympic athletes draw special coverage by
the media and the lay public. As a mere example,
3.6 billion TV viewers followed worldwide the pre-
vious 2012 London Games.1
Olympic athletes also raise scientific and clinical
interest, specifically regarding the criteria for eligibil-
ity and the most appropriate medical care.2 The rare,
but dramatic occurrence of sudden cardiac death/
cardiac arrest (SCD/CA) in elite competitors has,
over the last decade, further emphasised this issue.3–5
In the present study we sought, therefore, to
assess the prevalence and type of cardiovascular
(CV) abnormalities in a large cohort of Olympic
athletes. To the scope, we took advantage of the
data set derived from Italian Olympic athletes, eval-
uated for CV diseases in the context of a more
comprehensive medical programme.6
METHODS
Study population
For the present study, we considered athletes evalu-
ated in a 10-year period (from the Olympic Games
in Athens 2004 to Sochi 2014) within our CV pro-
gramme, which included medical history, physical
examination, 12-lead and exercise ECG, and echo-
cardiography.7 The Olympic medical programme is
implemented in our institution (and funded by the
Italian Olympic Committee) for athletes selected to
participate to the Olympic Games. Among the
2389 athletes entering the programme, 37 had
either incomplete or inadequate data and were
excluded. The final study population comprised,
therefore, 2352 Italian Olympic athletes.
Athletes aged 14–46 years (mean 25±6), with
64% males, competing in 31 summer or 15 winter
sport disciplines were recruited. W
e arbitrarily clas-
sified sport activities in four groups,8 that is, (1)
skill (such as table tennis, equestrian, shooting,
yachting, curling; n=572); (2) power (weightlifting,
sprinting, downhill skiing; n=414); (3) mixed
(soccer, basketball, volleyball, handball, water polo,
fencing, tennis; n=664) and (4) endurance disci-
plines (rowing, long-distance running and mara-
thon, cycling, triathlon, pentathlon, cross-country
skiing; n=702).
Athletes have been involved in training pro-
grammes for 3–12 years (average 6) and continued
to train intensely at the time of the study. All were
world-class competitors, and a substantial propor-
tion (45%) had participated in more than one
Olympic Game.

 Written informed consent was waived for athletes undergoing
a standard evaluation pursuant to Italian law and the Institute
policy. The study design was approved by the Review Board of
the Institute and funded by the Italian National Olympic
Committee. All clinical data assembled from athletes are main-
tained in an institutional database.
CV evaluation
Physical examination with personal and family history was per-
formed according to the recommendations of the IOC.2 Blood
pressure was measured according to the European Society of
Hypertension (ESH)/European Society of Cardiology (ESC)
guidelines.9
The 12-lead ECG was recorded with the participant in supine
position during quiet respiration, at 25 mm/s, using a Cardioline
ClickECG, (Cardioline, Italy). ECG analysis was performed
according to criteria distinguishing normal versus abnormal
ECG patterns in athletes, as previously reported.10–12
The exercise testing was performed on bicycle ergometer
(Cardioline XR400, Cardioline, Italy) with an incremental
protocol until exhaustion. ECG was continuously monitored
during exercise and 7 min of recovery.
T
wo-dimensional and Doppler echocardiography was per-
formed
by expert
cardiologists
using
an
iE33
ultrasound
machine
(Philips
Medical
System,
Andover,
Massachusetts,
USA). T
wo-dimensional measurements of cardiac structures, left
ventricle (LV) ejection fraction and mass were performed as
recommended by the American Society of Echocardiography/
European Association of Cardiovascular Imaging.13 LV inflow
velocities and tissue Doppler imaging signals were recorded in
the apical four chamber, as previously described.14
Additional investigations
Detection of >1 premature ventricular beat (PVB) on the
12-lead ECG and/or ≥3 PVBs during exercise testing, and/or
history
of
palpitation
was
indication
for
24-hour
ECG
monitoring.15
Additional tests were selectively performed to confirm diag-
nosis and/or assess risk stratification in athletes with abnormal
ECGs (most commonly, diffusely flat or inverted T-wave), ven-
tricular tachyarrhythmia, or borderline echocardiographic find-
ings (ie, grey-zone of LV hypertrophy), and included CV MR
(CMR, n=36), CT scan (n=3), coronary angiography (n=2).
Electrophysiological study (n=28), electroanatomic mapping
(CARTO, n=5) and radiofrequency ablation (RFA, n=15) were
selectively performed in athletes with either sustained supraven-
tricular or complex ventricular tachyarrhythmias.
Statistical analysis
The study design was a retrospective analysis of the CV abnor-
malities prevalence among Italian Olympic athletes. Continuous
data are expressed as mean±SD. Gender differences were
evaluated by unpaired-samples t-test. Differences between sport
disciplines were evaluated using analysis of variance. Differences
between proportions were evaluated by χ2 test. Statistical
analysis was performed using SPSS (V
.22, SPSS, Chicago,
Illinois, USA).
RESULTS
Demographic and CV characteristics
Mean age was 26±5 years for men and 23±4 for women
(p<0.001). Men had weight, height and body surface area
larger than women. Systolic and diastolic blood pressures were
relatively higher, while heart rate was lower in men. Cardiac
dimensions (LV cavity, wall thickness and mass) were larger in
men (table 1).
When analysed by type of sport, athletes competing in mixed
disciplines showed the largest body size. Endurance athletes
showed the lowest heart rate and relatively high blood pressure.
Cardiac dimensions (LV cavity, wall thickness and mass) were
larger in endurance compared with remaining athletes (table 2).
Clinical findings
Vast majority of the 2352 athletes, that is, 1979 (84.2%), pre-
sented completely normal CV findings. A substantial subset of
281
athletes
(11.9%)
showed
ECG
or
echocardiographic
changes (mostly, isolated PVBs, flat/inverted T-wave, LV hyper-
trabeculation, see figure 1), which after thorough investigation
were considered not to represent pathological cardiac condi-
tions, and deprived of clinical relevance.
The remaining 92 athletes (3.9%) presented CV abnormal-
ities, judged to be clinically relevant, including 66 (2.8%) with
structural abnormalities and 26 (1.1%) with primary electrical
diseases (figure 1).
Structural CV abnormalities
Cardiomyopathies were identified in four asymptomatic athletes.
Specifically, arrhythmogenic right ventricular cardiomyopathy
(ARVC)16 was diagnosed in a cyclist with PVBs with left bundle
branch block (LBBB) morphology on exercise-ECG and 24-hour
ECG monitoring. RV wall thinning, aneurysm and deranged tra-
becular pattern were evident on imaging testing. The electroana-
tomic mapping (CARTO) showed low voltages in the thinned
area of right ventricular (RV) free wall. In another pentathlon
athlete, diagnosis of ARVC was prompted by the deeply
inverted T-waves in anterior precordial leads (V1-V4) on
12-lead ECG, and non-sustained ventricular tachycardia (NSVT)
with LBBB morphology and superior axis on 24-hour ECG
monitoring. CMR and echocardiography showed only mild RV

 enlargement. Family screening revealed ECG repolarisation
abnormalities and ventricular tachyarrhythmias in the brother.
Hypertrophic cardiomyopathy (HCM)17 18 was identified in a
swimmer, showing inverted T-wave in aVL, biphasic in V2, V3
on 12-lead ECG. Both NSVT and frequent PVBs were present at
24-hour ECG monitoring. Imaging testing showed an asymmet-
ric LV hypertrophy (maximum thickness of 15–16 mm in anter-
ior septum) and a non-dilated LV cavity (LV diameter, 49 mm).
A causative mutation in the MyBPC-3 gene confirmed the diag-
nosis. In a water-polo player suspicion for HCM was prompted
by the asymmetric LV hypertrophy (anterior and posterior
septum, 16 mm; posterior free wall, 10 mm), which did not
regress after detraining, and was associated with a small LV
cavity (diastolic diameter, 48 mm). ECG showed small Q-wave
in inferior and lateral leads.
Coronary artery disease was diagnosed in a 33-year-old male
rower, presenting a 2 mm ST/T depression on exercise ECG,
associated with NSVT and polymorphic PVBs. Subsequent cor-
onary CT scan revealed a soft plaque, with 50% stenosis, on the
proximal left anterior descending (LAD) coronary. The athlete
had hypercholesterolaemia (low-density lipoprotein, 147 mg/dL,
or 3.8 mmol/L) and positive family history for ischaemic heart
disease.
Clinical diagnosis of perimyocarditis was prompted in two
athletes by the evidence of preceding or concomitant upper
respiratory condition, associated with positive inflammatory
markers (elevated C-reactive protein) and positive imaging
testing.19 Echocardiography showed mild pericardial effusion
(in both), associated with apical wall motion anomalies (in one).
T
wo additional athletes with previous and recent diagnosis of
perimyocarditis showed persistent mild pericardial effusion and
ventricular arrhythmias (PVBs and/or NSVT). Both these find-
ings, in the context of the clinical and laboratory resolution of
the inflammatory process, were interpreted as residual and pos-
sibly permanent signs of the healing process.
Myocardial
bridge
was
identified
in
two
athletes.
A
34-year-old free-style skier with 2 mm ST segment depression
on exercise ECG, showed on sestamibi scintigraphy a reversible
perfusion defect of the anterior LV wall. Coronary angiography
demonstrated a 2 mm deep and lengthy intramural tract of the
distal LAD. Another 30-year-old marathon runner presented
3 mm ST segment depression on exercise ECG. CT scan revealed
a short and 1.5 mm deep intramyocardial course of the prox-
imal LAD; myocardial scintigraphy failed to show any perfusion
impairment.
Vast majority of structural abnormalities comprised either
mitral valve prolapse (n=24) or bicuspid aortic valve (n=10),
here defined according to the American Heart Association
(AHA) task force criteria.20 21 Both conditions were associated
in one. Less frequent lesions included mild rheumatic aortic
stenosis (n=1), mild (n=2) or severe (n=1) pulmonary stenosis,
atrial septal defect (n=4) and patent ductus arteriosus (n=2).
Finally, systemic hypertension was diagnosed in 10 athletes by
blood pressure values consistently ≥140 and/or 90 mm Hg on
repeated measurements.9 Of them, six reported positive family
history for hypertension.
Primary electrical diseases
Primary electrical diseases comprised supraventricular or ven-
tricular tachyarrhythmias (n=23), or major conduction defects
(n=3).22 Recurrent episodes of paroxysmal atrial fibrillation
(AF) with rapid ventricular rate (up to 200 bpm) were recorded
on 24-hour ECG monitoring and exercise ECG in a female
tennis player, successfully resolved by RFA. Brief, repeated short
episodes of AF with low ventricular rate (average 70 bpm) were
recorded on ECG in a young triathlon athlete. In 14 other ath-
letes, all reporting of palpitations, prolonged runs of supraven-
tricular reciprocating tachycardia (SVT) were identified by
repeated 24-hour ECGs monitoring.
Bursts of NSVT (3–16 beats) were detected on exercise
and/or 24-hour ECG monitoring in six athletes (three of
them reported palpitations), associated with frequent and/or
polymorphic
PVBs
(in
three).
Another
athlete
showed
exercise-induced frequent, polymorphic PVBs and short bidirec-
tional NSVT
, suggestive for catecholaminergic ventricular tachy-
cardia (VT).

olff-Parkinson-White pattern was identified in a baseball
player. A long QT interval was suspected in a female judo
player,
with
QTc
of
0.48 s,
with
negative
gene
analysis.
LQT1was confirmed by presence of mutation in KCNQ1 in an
open-water male swimmer, with QTc interval of 0.47 s, increas-
ing during effort and recovery (0.48 s).
Prevalence of CV abnormalities was not different in relation
to the type of sport, that is, skill 2.5%; power 5.6%; mixed
4.5% and endurance 3.5%, respectively (p=0.077). No rela-
tionship was found between the type of sport and type of
cardiac abnormality.
Diagnostic pathway
The relative impact of the single diagnostic testing is shown in
the figure 2. History and physical examination identified 27 ath-
letes (29%), with systemic hypertension in 10, and valvular dis-
eases 17. The 12-lead ECG showed abnormalities suspicious for
underlying cardiac disease in 25 (27%), including repolarisation
abnormalities (n=11), left atrial enlargement (n=5), isolated
PVBs, prolonged QT interval and Q-wave (n=2, each). Less
commonly, left anterior fascicular block, WPW pattern and
complete right bundle branch block were observed (n=1, each).
Figure 1
The results of CV evaluation in Olympic athletes. Cardiovascular abnormalities: see detailed explanation in the manuscript. Minor
cardiovascular changes: conduction abnormalities included 6 athletes with right bundle branch block, 2 with left anterior fascicular block, 2 with
bi-fascicular block (n=10). PVB/premature supraventricular beats (PSVB), isolated and rare premature ventricular beats/supraventricular beats in the
absence of structural cardiac abnormality at the imaging testing (n=157); T-wave abnormalities, either inverted or diffusely flat T-wave in the
absence of structural CV abnormalities on imaging testing (n=31); LV hypertrabeculation, prominent LV trabecular pattern, in the absence of LV
dysfunction, abnormal clinical findings and positive family history, judged not to meet the criteria for left ventricular non-compaction (LVNC) (n=15);
valvular changes included mild elongation of the mitral valves without evidence of prolapse (n=25), mild asymmetric tricuspid aortic valve without
raphe (n=6); grey zone of LVH=LV wall thickness of 13–15 mm, associated with increased cavity size and normal diastolic function, compatible with
sport-induced physiological LV remodelling (athlete’s heart, n=4). Congenital changes included atrial septal aneurysm (n=13), patent foramen oval
(n=9) and corrected atrial septal defects (n=11). CAD, coronary artery disease; CV, cardiovascular; LV, left ventricle; LVH, LV hypertrophy; PSVB,
premature supraventricular beats; PVB, premature ventricular beat.

 The exercise-ECG showed marked ST-T wave changes in 3,
and exercise-induced supraventricular or ventricular tachyar-
rhythmias in 14 (18%). Finally, echocardiogram was respon-
sible
for
the
identification
of
unsuspected
structural
abnormalities in 23 athletes, including mitral valve prolapse
(n=13), bicuspid aortic valve (n=7) and atrial septal defect
(n=3).
In the overall group of 92 athletes with CV abnormalities,
primary suspicion for diagnosis was prompted by history and
physical examination in 27 (29%), by adding the 12-lead ECG
to Hx and PE in 52 (56%), and by exercise-ECG in 69 (75%).
Finally, inclusion of echocardiography identified 23 additional
participants, raising the count to 92 (100%) (figure 2). Of
notice, echocardiography and, in selected instances CMR, were
crucial either to confirm diagnosis (such as in cardiomyopathies)
and/or assess risk stratification (such as in tachyarrhythmias) in
71 of the 92 cases (or 77%).
Clinical management and sport participation
Clinical management and sport participation was advised
based on the current recommendations.23–25 Specifically, the
athletes with cardiomyopathies (HCM, n=2; arrhythmogenic
RV cardiomyopathy, n=2) were disqualified from competitive
sport and referred to local cardiologists. All remained asymp-
tomatic for periods of 4–12 years following our diagnosis.
The athlete with ischaemic heart disease started treatment
with statin and aspirin, quit competitions, and remained
asymptomatic over the subsequent 8 years. Athletes with clin-
ically paucisymptomatic perimyocarditis, without LV dysfunc-
tion, were treated with non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs
and/or colchicine, were temporarily restricted from competi-
tion, until demonstration of complete resolution of the inflam-
matory
process,
and
resumed
training
after
an
average
6-month period.23 24 Of the two athletes with bridge, only
the one with exercise-induced ischaemia (demonstrated by
impaired myocardial perfusion on scintigraphy) was with-
drawn from competitions and advised to start β-blockers
treatment.
Of the 14 athletes with SVT
, 9 underwent successful RFA
with resolution of symptoms. Of the six with NSVT
, based on
clinical and electrophysiological characteristics, four had indica-
tion for RFA, which resolved tachyarrhythmias and symptoms.
The athlete with bidirectional VT (without structural cardiac
abnormality)
was temporarily
withdrawn
from
sport,
and
entered a clinical follow-up.23 26 The ventricular arrhythmias
disappeared completely over 1 year, and the athlete resumed
training and competition. The athlete with WPW was advised to
undergo electrophysiological assessment of the shortest refrac-
tory period of the accessory pathway, which he refused. The
athlete with genetically proven LQT1 was disqualified23 24 and
advised to enter a follow-up.
Athletes with valvular diseases (except the one with severe
pulmonary stenosis, which was restricted from competitions)
continued their competitive career and remained free of symp-
toms and events, over the period (4–12 years) they were under
our observation. The same was true for all the athletes with
hypertension, who were periodically followed while competing
under the effect of ACE inhibitors or ARBs.
Overall, only 9 of 92 athletes with cardiac abnormalities were
disqualified from competitive sport, but 17 had temporary
restriction until resolution of their cardiac condition (with
medical or radiofrequency treatment), and then resumed their
competitive career.
DISCUSSION
The main finding of the present investigation was the unex-
pected prevalence of CV abnormalities identified in an ample
cohort of Italian Olympic athletes. In this selected population,
either structural cardiac abnormalities or primary electrical dis-
eases showed a surprising and unexpected prevalence (3.9%),
considering that all these athletes have been previously evaluated
within the national preparticipation screening27 before entering
our Olympic programme.
Among the cardiac findings we identified, a small but not neg-
ligible proportion was comprised of pathological conditions,
such as hypertrophic and arrhythmogenic cardiomyopathies
(0.2%), or complex ventricular tachyarrhythmias, WPW and
long QT syndrome (0.4%), which are associated to an increased
risk for SCD/CA during sport participation.3–5 Our experience,
therefore, suggests that even Olympic athletes may be exposed
to the unforeseen risk of underlying, life-threatening CV
diseases.
Our
observations
clearly
demonstrate
that
reaching
the
highest level of physical performance, such as that required for
participation in the Olympic Games, does not guarantee, per se,
the absence of serious cardiac disorders. In our experience, even
the
athletes
with
cardiomyopathies
engaged
in
the
most
demanding sports disciplines (such as cycling, swimming or tri-
athlon) denied symptoms or impairment in physical perform-
ance, and identification of their disease was made possible only
by virtue of our medical programme.
W
e acknowledge, however, that not all the CV abnormalities
we identified had the same clinical relevance. In fact, the major-
ity (60%) of the CV abnormalities comprised valvular diseases,
mostly mitral valve prolapse or bicuspid aortic valve, and sys-
temic hypertension, which did not raise concern relative to
management and did not represent contraindication for contin-
ued sport participation.23 24 It is likely that including echocardi-
ography in our protocol amplified the proportion of valvular
disease identified, most of whom not associated with ECG
alterations,
and
not
detectable
at
the
previous
screening
programme.
One final consideration regards athletes with ECG or echocar-
diographic alterations we judged deprived of pathological clin-
ical significance (figure 1). These athletes were eventually
considered free of patent cardiac disease based on negative
family history, absence of symptoms, unaffected physical per-
formance and imaging results, but were required to enter a peri-
odic follow-up. In this subset, we considered possible the
presence of clinically silent, phenotypically not yet expressed
cardiomyopathies. Therefore, we cannot exclude that some of
these athletes might develop in the future evidence for cardiac
diseases.28
The unexpected identification of pathological cardiac condi-
tions (such as cardiomyopathies, or primary electrical diseases,
in 0.6% of this athlete’s cohort) raises the question of the effi-
cacy of the national screening protocol implemented in Italy,
based mostly on 12-lead ECG.6 27 Retrospective analysis of the
diagnostic testing in athletes with cardiomyopathies and channe-
lopathies showed that ECG abnormalities were present at previ-
ous screening evaluations, but diagnosis was missed either
because of the inconclusive imaging results (cardiomyopathies)
or incorrect ECG interpretation (channelopathies). Both consid-
erations depict the real-world screening scenario, substantiating
the difficulty of definite diagnosis of ARVC and HCM when the
morphological changes are mild, and suggest the need for accur-
ate ECG interpretation, according to athlete-specific criteria.11 12

 Moreover, certain cardiac diseases were either not present at
previous screening (ie, the perimyocarditis), or not yet evident
(ie, atherosclerotic heart disease and phenotypic expression of
cardiomyopathies) due to the age-related progression, which
suggests that repetition of the screening over the years increases
the sensitivity to detect cardiac disease.
Implementation of the Olympic programme in Italy was a
decision of the National Olympic Committee, to prevent and
resolve any medical issue that might impair the athlete’s physical
performance, with the aim to maximise the athlete’s chances to
succeed.
Since 2009, the IOC has introduced and supported the
concept of periodical health evaluation in elite athletes.2
However, at present time, only few international federations
(FIFA, UCI) have implemented this programme for their elite
competitors and, as a matter of fact, no medical evaluation was
universally required for athletes, prior to their participation in
the Rio de Janeiro 2016 Summer Olympic Games. W
e trust that
our observations support the concept that medical evaluation of
Olympic athletes is appropriate and necessary.
In conclusion, this study shows an unexpected prevalence of
CV abnormalities in Olympic athletes, including a small, but not
negligible proportion of conditions at risk of SCD/CA. This
observation suggests that Olympic athletes, despite their aston-
ishing performance, are not immune from serious CV disorders
and legitimates the concept of a tailored screening programme
for the prevention of cardiac events and appropriate medical
care.
What are the findings?
▸ This study provides important new information on the
prevalence of cardiovascular diseases and abnormalities in
Olympic athletes.
▸ Olympic athletes are a population that is, mistakenly, always
considered healthy and free of life-threatening conditions.
▸ Relevant cardiovascular abnormalities and diseases were
identified during the preparticipation evaluation.
How might it impact on clinical practice in the future?
▸ The preventive approach adopted in this study, resulting
from our experience, strongly supports the adoption of a
specific evaluation model for Olympic athletes aimed at the
prevention and reduction of fatal events.
▸ Considering the effort that the cardiovascular system of
Olympic athletes has to sustain a specific approach is
recommended in this group of individuals.
▸ Findings from our Olympic athlete population suggest that
the preparticipation evaluation protocol of these athletes
should be tailored to their characteristics.
