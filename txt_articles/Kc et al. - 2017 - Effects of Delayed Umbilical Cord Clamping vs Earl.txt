IMPORTANCE Delayed umbilical cord clamping has been shown to improve iron stores in
infants to 6 months of age. However, delayed cord clamping has not been shown to prevent
iron deficiency or anemia after 6 months of age.
OBJECTIVE To investigate the effects of delayed umbilical cord clamping, compared with
early clamping, on hemoglobin and ferritin levels at 8 and 12 months of age in infants at high
risk for iron deficiency anemia.
DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS This randomized clinical trial included 540 late preterm
and term infants born vaginally at a tertiary hospital in Kathmandu, Nepal, from October 2 to
November 21, 2014. Follow-up included blood levels of hemoglobin and ferritin at 8 and 12
months of age. Follow-up was completed on December 11, 2015. Analysis was based on
intention to treat.
INTERVENTIONS Infants were randomized to delayed umbilical cord clamping (�180 seconds
after delivery) or early clamping (�60 seconds after delivery).
MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES Main outcomes included hemoglobin and anemia levels at
8 months of age with the power estimate based on the prevalence of anemia. Secondary
outcomes included hemoglobin and anemia levels at 12 months of age and ferritin level, iron
deficiency, and iron deficiency anemia at 8 and 12 months of age.
RESULTS In this study of 540 infants (281 boys [52.0%] and 259 girls [48.0%]; mean [SD]
gestational age, 39.2 [1.1] weeks), 270 each were randomized to the delayed and early
clamping groups. At 8 months of age, 212 infants (78.5%) from the delayed group and 188
(69.6%) from the early clamping group returned for blood sampling. After multiple
imputation analysis, infants undergoing delayed clamping had higher levels of hemoglobin
(10.4 vs 10.2 g/dL; difference, 0.2 g/dL; 95% CI, 0.1 to 0.4 g/dL). Delayed cord clamping also
reduced the prevalence of anemia (hemoglobin level <11.0 g/dL) at 8 months in 197 (73.0%)
vs 222 (82.2%) infants (relative risk, 0.89; 95% CI, 0.81-0.98; number needed to treat
[NNT], 11; 95% CI, 6-54). At 8 months, the risk for iron deficiency was reduced in the delayed
clamping group in 60 (22.2%) vs 103 (38.1%) patients (relative risk, 0.58; 95% CI, 0.44-0.77;
NNT, 6; 95% CI, 4-13). At 12 months, delayed cord clamping still resulted in a hemoglobin level
of 0.3 (95% CI, 0.04-0.5) g/dL higher than in the early cord clamping group and a relative risk
for anemia of 0.91 (95% CI, 0.84-0.98), resulting in a NNT of 12 (95% CI, 7-78).
CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE Delayed cord clamping reduces anemia at 8 and 12 months of
age in a high-risk population, which may have major positive effects on infants’ health and
development.

G
lobally, 43% of children younger than 5 years (approxi-
mately 273 million persons) have anemia, which is at-
tributable to iron deficiency in approximately 42%.1
Children with anemia and iron deficiency have associated im-
pairedneurodevelopment,affectingtheircognitive,motor,and
behavioral abilities.2,3 Food fortification and iron supplemen-
tation is currently used for treatment, and delayed umbilical
cord clamping has been proposed as a low-cost intervention
to reduce the risk for iron deficiency anemia.4-6
Afterdelivery,fetoplacentalbloodistransfusedtothenew-
born, augmenting the infant’
s blood volume by 30% to 40%
(roughly 25-30 mL/kg), if early cord clamping is avoided.7,8
Neonatal benefits include better cardiopulmonary adapta-
tion and higher hemoglobin concentrations to 2 to 3 months
of age.9-11 The blood transfused can contribute with 75 mg of
iron and has been shown to increase iron stores and prevent
iron deficiency in early infancy, to 6 months of life.10-13
In theory, this increased store of iron could help to pre-
vent iron deficiency and iron deficiency anemia later in in-
fancy. This possibility was not shown in a randomized clini-
cal trial among infants aged 12 months in Sweden,14 whereas
an observational trial performed in Peru15 found a 16% reduc-
tion in anemia at 8 months after a hospital policy change. Con-
vincing evidence is still lacking regarding the effect of de-
layed cord clamping on infants’iron stores after 6 months of
age. The aim of this randomized clinical trial was to explore
whetherdelayedcordclampingafter3minutes,comparedwith
clamping the cord before 60 seconds, would reduce anemia
and iron deficiency at 8 and 12 months of age in a low-income
country with a high prevalence of anemia.
Methods
Study Design
This randomized clinical trial was conducted in Nepal at the
ParopakarMaternityandWomen’
sHospital,Kathmandu,ater-
tiary center for obstetric and gynecologic service with a birth
rate of 22 000 per year. The trial design included 2 parallel
groups (1:1 ratio) randomized to delayed cord clamping (≥180
seconds) and early cord clamping (≤60 seconds). The cutoff
for early cord clamping was based on an observational study
in the hospital, which showed a mean (SD) umbilical cord
clampingtimeof61(33)seconds(ViktoriaNelin,MS,A.K.,O.A.,
N.R., M.M.; unpublished data; September 28, 2013). The in-
stitutional review board of the hospital and the ethical re-
view board of Nepal Health Research Council approved the
study. The study protocol is available in Supplement 1 and has
been published elsewhere.16 Written consent was obtained af-
ter assignment to the Maternal and Neonatal Service Centre
(MNSC)ofParopakarMaternityandWomen’
sHospitalfromthe
women who were eligible and willing to participate.
Study Population
Paropakar Maternity and Women’
s Hospital has 2 delivery de-
partments, a high-risk labor room and the low-risk MNSC. The
hospital criteria for admission to the MNSC included uncom-
plicated pregnancies, no complication at admission, and
healthy mothers (no clinical history of hypertension, infec-
tion, diabetes, or any chronic medical condition), expected
vaginal delivery, gestational age of 34 to 41 weeks, and single-
ton pregnancy. Women were eligible to participate in the study
if they were assigned to the MNSC. The exclusion criteria were
predefined as serious congenital malformations or congeni-
tal disease that could affect the outcome measures.
Randomization and Masking
One of us (O.A.) prepared a list using the random digit genera-
tor in the Excel program (Microsoft Corporation). Sequen-
tially numbered, opaque envelopes were prepared holding
cardswithdetailsoftheallocatedgroup.Theseenvelopeswere
keptattheresearchofficeandwerebroughttothedeliveryunit
before randomization.
Randomization occurred when delivery was imminent.
The surveillance officer opened the next consecutively num-
bered envelope and informed the nurse-midwife of the allo-
cation. The details of sequence generation and allocation con-
cealment were limited to the investigator (O.A.), who had no
clinical involvement in the trial but participated in data analy-
sisafterthetrialhadended.Thesurveillanceofficerandnurse-
midwife did not inform the mother of the allocated treat-
ment. However, the mother might have noticed the nature of
intervention. The outcome assessors were blinded to the al-
location, as were the members of the research team who
obtained the outcome measurements.

Key Points
Question Can delaying umbilical cord clamping for 3 minutes after
birth reduce anemia at 8 and 12 months of age?
Findings In this randomized clinical trial, 540 newborns were
randomized to delayed umbilical cord clamping (>3 minutes) or
early clamping no later than 1 minute. This delay resulted in a
significant reduction in the prevalence of anemia by 9% at 8
months or age and 8% at 12 months of age.
Meaning By extending umbilical cord clamping to longer than 3
minutes after birth, infants in low-resource settings experience
less anemia, which may have positive effects on health and
development.

herlastmenstrualperiod.Birthweightwasbasedontheweight
taken on an analog weighing scale.
At 8 and 12 months, laboratory staff collected a venous
blood sample (2 mL) from the infants with a needle of a 3-mL
syringe(LifelineServicesPvtLtd).Thebloodsamplewastrans-
ferred into an anticoagulant-treated vial (EDTA K3; Zhejiang
Gongdong Medical Technology Co, Ltd). Blood samples were
stored at room temperature and analyzed the same day. A he-
matology analyzer (ABX Pentra XL 80; Horiba Medical) was
used for hemoglobin analysis, and an immunoassay system
(ADVIA Centaur; Siemens Healthcare GmbH) was used for fer-
ritin analysis. At the 8- and 12-month visits, parents were in-
terviewed regarding the feeding habits of the infant (eg, what
type of food had been given and frequency of meals).
Outcomes
Theprimaryoutcomewasprespecifiedasthehemoglobinlevel
at 8 months of age. Hemoglobin level was analyzed by com-
paring means and as a categorical variable, defining anemia
as a hemoglobin level of less than 11.0 g/dL (altitude cor-
rected) (to convert to grams per liter, multiply by 10.0). The
secondary outcomes included the following:
•Hemoglobin level at 12 months of age, analyzed by compar-
ing means and as a categorical variable with the same defi-
nition of anemia.
•Ferritin levels at 8 and 12 months of age, analyzed by com-
paring means and as categorical variables, with iron defi-
ciency defined as a ferritin level of less than 12 μg/L (to con-
vert to picomoles per liter, multiply by 2.247).17
•Iron deficiency anemia at 8 and 12 months of age, defined as
ferritin and hemoglobin levels below the respective cutoffs.
•Other secondary outcomes that will be described in sepa-
rate reports are transcutaneous bilirubin level at discharge,
breast-feeding and morbidity during the first 6 months of life,
and psychomotor development at 12 months of age.
Altitude Correction
We used the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention hemo-
globin adjustment method of −0.32 × (altitude × 0.0032808)
+ 0.22 × (altitude × 0.0032808).2 The altitude of Kathmandu
of 1400 m was entered in the formula, resulting in a correction
of 0.32 g/dL, which was subtracted from each of the individual
hemoglobin results before making descriptive statistics and
group comparisons.18
Statistical Analysis
Analysis was based on intention to treat. We based the sample
size calculation on examining the effect of cord clamping on
anemia at 8 months of age. The national prevalence of ane-
mia was 70% at 8 months.19 To find a difference of 15% (from
70% to 55%) in prevalence between the treatment groups with
80% power and 0.05 type I error, 176 infants were needed in
each group, and after allowing for 35% attrition we decided to
allocate 270 in each treatment group.
We used an unpaired 2-tailed t test for variables with nor-
mal distribution; categorical variables were compared be-
tween groups using the Fisher exact test. Ferritin concentra-
tion was log10 transformed for analysis.
Considerationwastakenforbaselineorfollow-updatathat
were imbalanced between treatment groups and significantly
correlatedwithprimaryandsecondaryoutcomes.Weusedmul-
tivariate analysis of variance (MANOVA) and logistic regres-
sion analysis, as appropriate, to control for this imbalance.
Owing to attrition rates at 8 and 12 months, we analyzed
data using the multiple imputation method in SPSS (version
22; IBM Corp). Variables included in the model as predictors
were time to clamping, mother’
s age, previous pregnancies,
gestational age, birth weight, sex, and time from delivery to
discharge in hours. Age in days and hemoglobin and ferritin
levels at 8 months were entered as dependent and predictive
variables, whereas age and hemoglobin and ferritin levels at
12 months of age were entered as only dependent variables.
Imputation was performed 5 times.
Results
From October 2 to November 21, 2014, 540 women who were
admittedtoMNSCagreedtoparticipateinthestudy.Aftersigned
consent was obtained and as birth was imminent, 270 women
were randomly assigned to cord clamping no later than 60 sec-
onds (early) and 270 to cord clamping after at least 3 minutes
(delayed) subsequent to the appearance of the infant’
s shoul-
der. Of the 540 included newborns (281 boys [52.0%] and 259
girls [48.0%]; mean [SD] gestational age, 39.2 [1.1] weeks), 466
(86.3%) received the allocated intervention (Figure). For the
8-monthfollow-up,400infants(74.1%)returnedforbloodsam-
pling from May 25 to August 4, 2015; for the 12-month follow-
up, 334 infants (61.9%) returned from September 6 to Decem-
ber 11, 2015. The median time to clamping the umbilical cord
was 192 (interquartile range, 185-199) seconds for the delayed
clamping group and 32 (interquartile range, 23-45) seconds for
theearlyclampinggroup(P < .001).Wefoundnosignificantdif-

At 8 postpartum months, 212 children (78.5%) returned in the
delayed clamping group and 188 (69.6%) in the early clamp-

(Table 3). The relative risk for having iron deficiency was 0.58
(95% CI, 0.44-0.77) in the delayed group, with a number
needed to treat (NNT) of 6 (95% CI, 4-13); the relative risk for
having iron deficiency anemia was 0.58 (95% CI, 0.42-0.78),
with an NNT of 7 (95% CI, 5-6).
At the age of 12 months, 177 infants (65.6%) in the de-
layed group and 157 (58.1%) in the early group returned at a
mean (SD) age of 357 (17) days. Mean hemoglobin was 0.3 (95%

mia was less prevalent in the delayed clamping group, with a
relative risk of 0.91 (95% CI, 0.84-0.98), resulting in an NNT
of 12 (95% CI, 7-78) (Table 3). No difference was found in se-
rum ferritin level or prevalence of iron deficiency or iron de-
ficiency anemia between groups (Table 3).

fruits that were given to 27 of 212 infants (12.7%) in the de-
layed clamping group and 48 of 188 infants (25.5%) in the early
clamping group (P = .003). We found no difference in occa-
sions of respective feedings per day between groups. At 12
months of age, 298 of 334 infants (89.2%) were still partially
breast-fed. The types of other kinds of food and occasion of
feeding did not differ between groups. The parents did not re-
port giving iron supplements to any infant.
Gestational age was not statistically balanced between
treatment groups (Table 1), and at 12 months the mean (SD) age
of the infant at the time of blood sampling also differed sig-
nificantlybetweengroupsat359(17)daysinthedelayedclamp-

tering gestational age as a covariate when analyzing variables
from the 8- and 12-month blood samples and adding age as a
covariate in the analyses of 12-month blood samples. The re-
sults from the MANOVA and logistic regression analysis did not

Discussion
Previous studies of cord clamping have shown reduced iron
deficiency at 4 and 6 months of age.12,13,20 As an advance-
ment to this knowledge, the present study resulted in im-
proved hemoglobin levels and reduced anemia in infants at 8
and 12 months of age after clamping the umbilical cord was de-
layed until at least 3 minutes after birth, compared with less
than or equal to 1 minute.
The improved iron stores at 3 to 6 months have been hy-
pothesized to protect against anemia later in infancy.6,12,14 We
found 7 systematic reviews10,11,21-25 regarding delayed vs early
umbilical cord clamping in term infants published during the
last decade. In summary, all conclude that delayed cord clamp-
ing after birth results in higher concentrations of hemoglobin
and hematocrit during the neonatal period, increased serum
ferritin levels, and a lower incidence of iron deficiency at 4 to
6 months of age.
Few studies on umbilical cord clamping are found in the
literature with follow-up after 6 months, and results are in-
conclusive. We have only identified 3 studies.14,15,26 In 1941,
Wilson et al26 compared 15 infants whose umbilical cords were
clamped immediately with 13 whose cords were clamped af-
ter the placenta began to descend into the vagina. The infants
inthedelayedclampinggrouphadsignificanthighermeancor-
puscular hemoglobin levels at 8 to 10 months of age (P = .007,
ourcalculationusingdatainthearticle),whereasthemean(SD)
hemoglobin concentration was higher, but not significantly
(11.8 [1.3] vs 10.8 [1.8] g/dL; P = .09, our calculation using data
in the article).26 An observation study conducted by Gyorkos
et al15 in Peru, a setting similar to Nepal, on the effect of a hos-
pital policy change toward delayed cord clamping resulted in
improved hemoglobin levels and significantly reduced ane-
mia at 8 postpartum months among 184 infants. A random-
ized clinical trial14 comparing cord clamping after 180 sec-
onds with clamping before 10 seconds in 337 infants from
Sweden found no differences in hemoglobin or iron status at
12 months of age, most likely owing to an unexpected low
prevalence of anemia (11%-15%) and iron deficiency (3%-5%)
at that age.
Our randomized clinical trial shows a significant effect on
anemia at 8 months of age, with a risk reduction of 11% in the
delayed cord clamping group paired with a 42% risk reduc-
tion in iron deficiency. We had hypothesized that delayed cord
clampingwouldincreaseinfantironstoresandhemoglobinlev-
els to 12 months of age. However, although anemia was less
prevalent and the mean hemoglobin concentration was higher
among the delayed cord clamping group at 12 months, the se-
rumferritinlevelwasnothigherinthedelayedclampinggroup
compared with the early clamping group, most probably ow-
ing to an increasing importance of complementary food as a
source of iron.27 An additional important observation from our
results is that a relatively extended definition of early cord
clamping(≤60seconds)stillwasinferiortodelayedcordclamp-
ing after 180 seconds.
Strengths and Limitations
Some of the strengths and limitations of the study are corre-
lated with the advantages and difficulties associated with the
setting in a low-income country. Inclusion was performed dur-
ing a comparable short time (approximately 7 weeks), which
might prevent biases that could occur owing to a longer

to our study. We expected a high attrition rate of 35% at 8
months owing to difficulties communicating with the in-
cluded families and powered the study accordingly. The ac-
tual attrition rates included 140 infants (25.9%) at 8 and 206
infants (38.1%) at 12 months. These numbers were close to the
expected attrition rate but may be associated with bias in the
results. To adjust for attrition, results are presented after mul-
tiple imputation analysis.
Furthermore, a high incidence of protocol deviation oc-
curred in the delayed cord clamping group. When analysis was
based on intention to treat, 22.6% of the infants in the de-
layed cord clamping group underwent clamping before 1 min-
ute, because the nurse-midwives perceived that early clamp-
ing against the allocation was required. An analysis of only
those cases that were handled per protocol showed similar re-
sults (eTables 1 and 2 in Supplement 2). Only women with rela-
tively low-risk pregnancies were included in the study, which
might impair the generalizability of the study, although the
rates of anemia in the study group were comparable with those
of earlier reports from Nepal.28
Conclusions
This study shows that delayed cord clamping for 180 seconds
was an effective intervention to reduce anemia at 8 and 12
months of age in a high-risk population with minimal cost and
withoutapparentadverseeffects.Iftheinterventionwasimple-
mented on a global scale, this could translate to 5 million fewer
infants with anemia at 8 months of age, with particular pub-
lic health significance in South Asia and Sub-Saharan Africa,
where the prevalence of anemia is the highest.
Children with anemia and iron deficiency are more likely
to experience stunting and delayed psychomotor
development.2 One study has shown that delayed cord

clamping compared with early cord clamping improved scores
in fine-motor and social domains at 4 years of age.29 Further
follow-up studies will be required to evaluate the effect of
delayed cord clamping on neurodevelopmental milestones in
preschool and school children. Additional research may be
needed to evaluate whether the optimal timing of cord clamp-
ing may be even later than 180 seconds (ie, at the delivery of
the placenta).
