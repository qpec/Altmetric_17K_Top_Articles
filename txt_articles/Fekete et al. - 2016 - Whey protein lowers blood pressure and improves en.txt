ABSTRACT
Background: Cardiovascular diseases (CVDs) are the greatest
cause of death globally, and their reduction is a key public-health
target. High blood pressure (BP) affects 1 in 3 people in the United
Kingdom, and previous studies have shown that milk consumption
is associated with lower BP.
Objective: We investigated whether intact milk proteins lower 24-h
ambulatory blood pressure (AMBP) and other risk markers of CVD.
Design: The trial was a double-blinded, randomized, 3-way–crossover,
controlled intervention study. Forty-two participants were randomly
assigned to consume 2 3 28 g whey protein/d, 2 3 28 g Ca casein-
ate/d, or 2 3 27 g maltodextrin (control)/d for 8 wk separated by
a 4-wk washout. The effects of these interventions were examined with
the use of a linear mixed-model ANOVA.
Results: Thirty-eight participants completed the study. Signifi-
cant reductions in 24-h BP [for systolic blood pressure (SBP):
23.9 mm Hg; for diastolic blood pressure (DBP): 22.5 mm Hg;
P = 0.050 for both)] were observed after whey-protein consump-
tion compared with control intake. After whey-protein supplemen-
tation compared with control intake, peripheral and central systolic
pressures [25.7 mm Hg (P = 0.007) and 25.4 mm Hg (P = 0.012),
respectively] and mean pressures [23.7 mm Hg (P = 0.025) and
24.0 mm Hg (P = 0.019), respectively] were also lowered. Flow-
mediated dilation (FMD) increased significantly after both whey-
protein and calcium-caseinate intakes compared with control intake
[1.31% (P , 0.001) and 0.83% (P = 0.003), respectively]. Although
both whey protein and calcium caseinate significantly lowered
total cholesterol [20.26 mmol/L (P = 0.013) and 20.20 mmol/L
(P = 0.042), respectively], only whey protein decreased triacylgly-
cerol (20.23 mmol/L; P = 0.025) compared with the effect of the
control. Soluble intercellular adhesion molecule 1 and soluble vas-
cular cell adhesion molecule 1 were reduced after whey protein
consumption (P = 0.011) and after calcium-caseinate consumption
(P = 0.039), respectively, compared with after control intake.
Conclusions: The consumption of unhydrolyzed milk proteins (56 g/d)
for 8 wk improved vascular reactivity, biomarkers of endothelial
function, and lipid risk factors. Whey-protein supplementation
also lowered 24-h ambulatory SBP and DBP. These results may
have important implications for public health. This trial was
registered at clinicaltrials.gov as NCT02090842.

INTRODUCTION
Cardiovascular disease (CVD)6 remains the main cause of
death in Western countries, although there has been a substantial
decrease in its incidence in the past 2 decades. Despite the re-
duction in incidence, the prevalence of CVD is growing because
of the increasing aging population in these countries (1). Of the
modifiable risk factors of CVD, elevated blood pressure (BP) is
a key risk factor. In the United Kingdom, nearly 30% of adults
have hypertension, and a high percentage remain untreated (1).
This lack of treatment can have serious consequences such as
stroke, organ damage, or organ failure and death, which
places an immense burden on the healthcare system. Note that
even a small decrease in SBP of 2–5-mm Hg can translate into

 considerable reductions in CVD and total mortality (2). An im-
proved quality of diet has been linked to a decrease in BP (3), and
epidemiologic studies have shown an inverse association between
milk consumption and BP (4). Milk is a complex food that contains
several potential bioactive compounds; therefore, it remains to be
confirmed which constituents may be responsible for the beneficial
effect. Previous studies have linked milk-protein consumption
with reduced BP (5); however, there has been an imbalance in the
literature, because most attention has focused on the casein-
derived lactotripeptides or other milk-protein hydrolysates (6) with
a clear evidence gap on the effects of intact milk-protein isolates on
BP (7). Milk proteins in liquid milk exist in intact forms, and evi-
dence from robust randomized controlled trials (RCTs) would
provide valuable information on the potential mechanism by which
milk may affect BP. Furthermore, there is a clear need for a bet-
ter assessment of BP, because the use of clinic BP may be con-
founded by the so-called white-coat effect. The 24-h ambulatory
blood pressure (AMBP) is considered to be the gold standard, and
AMBP predicts cardiovascular events, mortality, and morbidity that
are associated with hypertension better than does clinic BP (8–10).
Vascular dysfunction is defined as the suppression of endothelium-
dependent vasodilation or arterial stiffness (11, 12), and several
factors such as hypertension, atherosclerosis, or diabetes can
influence its rate of progression (13). Little attention has fo-
cused on the potential impact of dairy proteins on vascular
function. Pal and Ellis (7) reported a decrease in BP after both
whey-protein and sodium-caseinate supplementation for 12 wk;
however, they showed improvements in arterial stiffness only after
whey-protein consumption. This result may indicate that whey
protein has an additional beneficial effect on the cardiovascular
system compared with that of caseinate; however, this possibility
remains to be confirmed.
Therefore, our hypothesis was that whey-protein and calcium-
caseinate supplementation, compared with control intake, would
reduce 24-h AMBP, improve vascular function, and beneficially
affect other cardiometabolic risk markers. This hypothesis was
tested in a randomized, controlled, double-blinded, 3-way–
crossover dietary intervention in prehypertensive and mildly
hypertensive men and women.
METHODS
Subjects
Healthy, nonsmoking men and women with mildly elevated BP
of 120/80–159/99 mm Hg who were aged 30–77 y and were not
taking antihypertensive or cholesterol-lowering medications
were recruited for this study through database, local newspaper,
and electronic advertisements. This study was conducted at the
Hugh Sinclair Unit of Human Nutrition, University of Reading,
between February 2014 and February 2015. Inclusion criteria
were as follows: a signed consent form; BP from 120/80 to
159/99 mm Hg; aged 30–77 y; BMI (in kg/m2) from 20 to 40;
glucose concentration ,7 mmol/L (not diagnosed with di-
abetes); cholesterol concentration ,8 mmol/L; triacylglycerol
concentration ,4 mmol/L; normal liver and kidney function;
and hemoglobin concentration .110 and .140 g/dL for women
and men, respectively. Participants were excluded on the basis
of the following criteria: a milk allergy or lactose intolerance;
celiac disease or renal, gastrointestinal, respiratory, endocrine, or
liver disease or cancer; surgery in the previous 6 mo; secondary
hypertension; excess alcohol consumption (drinking .280 mL
and .210 mL ethanol/wk for men and women, respectively);
smoking; being a vegan; taking a nutritional supplement (e.g., fish
oil, protein shakes, or vitamins); anemia; and pregnancy, lacta-
tion, or planning a pregnancy. Blood donation was not allowed for
3 mo before or during the study. All volunteers provided a signed
consent form at the screening visit before their inclusion in the
study and agreed to adhere to the trial guidelines and give noti-
fication of any noncompliance. To detect the arithmetic mean 6
SEM SBP intergroup difference (primary outcome) of 4.9 6
6.5 mm Hg (7, 14) with 90% power and at a 5% significance
level, 37 participants were required, which increased to 42 par-
ticipant to account for a 12% dropout rate (n = 5).
Study design
The study was approved by the Research Ethics Committee at
the University of Reading (Research Ethics Committee project
12/40), and the protocol was conducted in accordance with the
ethical standards laid down in the 1964 Declaration of Helsinki.
This trial was registered at clinicaltrials.gov as NCT02090842. The
study was a randomized, double-blinded, controlled, 3-way–
crossover, dietary intervention study with a 2-wk run-in period
before the beginning of the trial. There were two 4-wk washout
periods that separated the 3 intervention arms of 8 wk. The total
duration of the study was 32 wk. The study design is shown in
Supplemental Figure 1. The volunteers were randomly assigned
by an independent researcher with the use of an Excel-based
random-assignment program (ExtendOffice 12.5) (15) who was
also responsible for the treatment allocation. Equal numbers of
volunteers were allocated within 6 treatment sequences (ABC,
ACB, BAC, BCA, CAB, and CBA). A double-blinded protocol
was maintained throughout the study, and during the statistical
analysis. The codes for the study drinks were kept under lock at
Volac International Ltd. (Cambridge) and the University of Reading.
The primary outcome was 24-h AMBP, and secondary out-
comes were vascular reactivity measured with the use of FMD
and changes in plasma lipids, markers of insulin resistance, in-
flammatory markers, and arterial stiffness measured with the use
of a pulse wave analysis and digital volume pulse (DVP).
Study drinks
The 3 treatment products were 90% whey-protein isolate
(Volac International Ltd.), 90% calcium caseinate (Garret In-
gredients), and maltodextrin (control) (MyProtein) and were
packed into identical foil sachets that were labeled with study
codes. All products were commercially available. Each protein-
containing sachet contained 28 g powder and 27 g maltodextrin in
the control sachets, which provided closely matched amounts of
energy (1596 kJ/100 g for whey protein, 1519 kJ/100 g for
calcium caseinate, and 1628 kJ/100 g for maltodextrin) (for
nutrient compositions, see Supplemental Table 1). Calcium
caseinate was used in this study instead of sodium caseinate to
reduce the potential bias toward the effect of whey protein be-
cause sodium may unfavorably affect BP. Volunteers were asked
to consume 2 sachets/d mixed with 250 mL H2O. Participants
were also given a choice of sugar-free flavor concentrates [va-
nilla, banana, tropical fruit, or chocolate (MyProtein)] that were to

 be added before consumption to mask any possible taste of the
supplements and to increase compliance. Furthermore, volunteers
were informed at the start of the study that all 3 treatments were
substantially different from one another in terms of taste and
appearance to reduce the possibility of them identifying the
protein interventions. Subjects were required to refrain from
mixing the sachet content with milk to avoid increasing their
milk intake. Participants were also asked to maintain iso-
energetic diets to account for the extra energy intake from the
consumption of the study drinks. Volunteers were provided with
individual nutritional advice by a dietitian and a nutritionist on
specific strategies for the incorporation of study drinks into their
diets without a substantial change to their habitual food intakes.
Participants recorded the exchanged foods (types and weights)
on tailored diary sheets, which were evaluated at each study
visit, and feedback was provided to the volunteers as to their
compliance to the interventions. Subjects were also required to
record their consumption of the sachets by marking tick boxes as
well as by keeping empty sachets to monitor compliance.
Study visits
At the screening visit, data on height and weight were collected.
Height was measured to the nearest 0.5 cm with the use of a wall-
mounted stadiometer. Furthermore, weight and BMI were measured
with the use of a regularly calibrated bioelectroimpedence scale
(Tanita BC-418 digital scale; Tanita Europe) with the use of standard
settings (normal body type and +1 kg for clothing) while wearing
light clothing. A fasted serum blood sample was collected to assess
serum glucose, total cholesterol, triacylglycerol, creatinine, biliru-
bin, uric acid, alanine aminotransferase, g-glutamyl transpeptidase,
and alkaline phosphatase with the use of an autoanalyzer
[ILAB600; Werfen (UK) Ltd.]. Participants were also checked for
anemia by a full blood count. After 20 min rest, BP measurement
was taken on the upper left arm with the use of an automatic BP
monitor (A/A-grade automated oscillometric BP monitors; A&D
Instruments Ltd.), which recorded BP readings every 5 min up to
30 mins in a temperature-controlled, quiet environment. The
mean of 6 readings was used to assess resting BP to the nearest
0.5 mm Hg. Participants were required to complete a food-
frequency questionnaire (FFQ) (European Prospective Inves-
tigation into Cancer and Nutrition-Norfolk FFQ v.6) and were
asked to remain seated and to refrain from speaking. FFQs were
subsequently analyzed with the use of FETA (EPIC, Norfolk)
for Windows GLP v2.53 software (16).
The run-in period started with a familiarization visit (visit 0) in
the clinical room where the study visits were conducted at the
Hugh Sinclair Unit of Human Nutrition to familiarize participants
with the environment and, thus, decrease the so-called white-coat
effect on the clinic BP and vascular measurements. All volunteers
had a one-by-one consultation with the study researcher. During
this session, volunteers were provided with verbal and written
instructions on the consumption and recording of the consumption
of the study drinks, the maintenance of an isocaloric diet, the use of
the 24-h AMBP, and the recording of 4-d estimated dietary intake
(including 3 weekdays and 1 weekend day). Participants were
required to complete the diaries on 6 occasions before each study
visit. Portion sizes were estimated with the use of household
measures or portion-size images (17), which were later quantified
by a trained dietitian with the use of food-portion tables (18).
Dietplan 6.6 software (Forestfield Software) was used to assess
nutrient intakes of participants for which the National Diet and
Nutrition Survey nutrient databank was implemented (19). Volun-
teers were specifically asked their body weight and reminded at
each study visit to maintain their body weights and physical ac-
tivities and to continue any permitted medication use without any
change in the dose during the interventions of which they had to
keep record. All vascular measurement techniques and their im-
plementation were clearly explained and shown to the participants.
At baselines (visits 1, 3, and 5) and at the end of all 3 in-
tervention periods (visit 2, 4, and 6), overnight (12-h) fasting
venous blood samples were collected for biochemical analysis.
Participants were required to refrain from alcohol and aerobic
exercises for 24-h before visits, and they had to orally confirm that
they adhered to this protocol. Volunteers consumed a low-fat and
low-protein meal the evening before each visit and drank only low-
nitrate water (Buxton Mineral Water; Nestl´
e Waters UK). Body
weight and body composition were measured as specified pre-
viously upon arrival to the nutrition unit. Hand-grip strength was
assessed with the use of a hand-grip dynamometer (SU424; JP
Lennard Ltd.). Volunteers were asked to perform 3 maximum
hand-grip tests with each hand in a standing position with their
arms along their bodies. The mean of the 3 measurements cal-
culated the hand-grip strength. Participants rested for 30 min in
a supine position in a quiet, temperature-controlled room (208C 6
18C) before vascular testing. Before the commencement of vas-
cular measurements, clinic BP was taken on the left upper arm
with the use of a validated BP monitor (Omron MX2 Digital
Automatic Upper Arm Blood Pressure Monitor; OMRON), and
the mean of 3 consecutive measurements was recorded. All
measurements were conducted by the same researcher (except
for the DVP, which was operated by multiple trained researchers)
and at the same time of day for all visits. Premenopausal women
attended all visits at the same phase of their menstrual cycles.
Twenty-four-hour AMBP and assessments of vascular
function
AMBP was measured with the use of A/A-grade automated
oscillometric AMBP monitors (A&D Instruments Ltd.). Twenty-
four-hour AMBP and heart rate were recorded every 30 min from
0700 to 2159 and every 60 min from 2200 to 0659 no later than
48 h before clinical visits. Mean 24-h day and night measure-
ments were assessed with the use of sleep times that were
recorded on the volunteer activity forms. Pulse pressure was
expressed as the difference between SBP and DBP.
FMD was performed by a single, trained researcher as pre-
viously described (20). The technique assessed the endothelial-
dependent vasodilation of the vasculature with the use of a
CX50 Ultrasound System (Philips) according to standard guide-
lines (21). Electrocardiogram-gated image acquisition was per-
formed at 0.25 frames/s with the use of image-grabbing software
(Medical Imaging Applications LLC). The analysis of the
obtained images was conducted by a single researcher with
the use of wall-tracking software (Vascular Research Tools 5;
Medical Imaging Applications LLC). FMD was calculated as the
maximum change in the postocclusion brachial artery diameter,
which was expressed as the percentage of the baseline diameter
[flow-medated dilatation percentage (%FMD)]. The %FMD was
assessed 3 times on each image, and the mean was calculated.

 The arterial stiffness of peripheral vessels was assessed in trip-
licate as detailed elsewhere (22) with the use of a radial pulse-
wave analysis (SphygmoCor; AtCor Medical). The pulse-wave
analysis determined the augmentation index, which was cor-
rected for a heart rate of 75 beats/min (percentage). The digital
volume pulse (Pulse Trace PCA2; Micro Medical Ltd.) provided
an indication of the stiffness index (meters per second) and re-
flection index (percentage) as measures of arterial stiffness and
vascular tone, respectively (20).
Biochemical analyses
Fasted blood samples were centrifuged at 1800 3 g for 15 min
at 208C (serum separator blood collection tube; VACUETTE,
Greiner Bio-One) to obtain serum and at 1800 3 g for 10 min at
48C (blood collection tubes containing lithium heparin and EDTA;
V
ACUETTE; Greiner Bio-One) to obtain plasma. Samples were
kept at 2208C. Lipids (total cholesterol, HDL cholesterol, and
triacylglycerol), glucose, nonesterified fatty acid, and C-reactive
protein were quantified from serum with the use of an autoanalyzer
[ILAB600; Werfen (UK) Ltd.; reagents and analyzer: In-
strumentation Laboratory Ltd.; nonesterified fatty acid reagent:
Alpha Laboratories). LDL cholesterol was estimated with the use of
Friedewald’s formula (23). Insulin resistance was determined with
the use of HOMA-IR, and insulin sensitivity was assessed with the
original and revised quantitative insulin sensitivity check indexes
with the use of standard equations (24). ELISA kits were used to
determine serum insulin (Dako Ltd.), intercellular and vascular
adhesion molecules, E-selectin, and P-selectin; high-sensitivity kits
were used to determine IL-6 and TNF-a (R&D Systems Europe
Ltd.). Plasma nitrite and nitrate were measured with the use of
HPLC with online reduction of nitrate to nitrite and postcolumn
derivatization with the Griess reagent (ENO-30 Analyzer; Eicom)
as described elsewhere (25). Serum angiotensin-converting enzyme
(ACE) activity was determined by a fluorometric assay as described
elsewhere (26). Mean intra-assay and interassay CVs were ,5%
for the automated assays and ,10% for other assays.
In vitro ACE inhibitory effects of intervention products
To assess the ACE inhibitory (ACEi) effect of intervention
proteins and the control, the study products were digested in vitro
on the basis of the method of Mills et al. (27) with minor
modifications. The total digesta were filtered with the use of-
3kDa VIVASPIN 20 centrifuge tubes (Sartorius AG) to mimic
in vivo intestinal absorption. The ACEi effect of intervention
proteins and the control were measured with the use of a spec-
trophotometric assay with the substrate furanacryloyl-Phe-Gly-
Gly and ACE, which were extracted from rabbit lung (both from
Sigma-Aldrich) (28, 29). The ACEi effect was expressed as

Absno sample is the absorbance of the enzyme-substrate mixture in
the absence of digested protein, and Abssample is the absorbance of
the enzyme-substrate mixture in the presence of digested protein.
Statistical analyses
Statistical analyses were performed with the use of SAS
version 9.4 software (SAS Institute Inc.). Suitable checks for
normality were performed (evaluated with the use of histograms
and quantile-quantile plots) with IBM SPSS Statistics version 21
software (SPSS Inc.), and data were logarithmically transformed
as appropriate. The data from participants who withdrew from the
study were excluded in the analysis because a per-protocol
analysis was used. The effects of treatments were evaluated by
implementing a linear mixed-model ANOVA with the use of the
difference from baseline (D; visit 2 2 visit 1) as a dependent
variable and baseline values of the variable of interest, BMI, age,
sex, and intervention treatment as prognostic variables. P # 0.05
was considered significant. Data presented in the text, tables,
and figures represent arithmetic means 6 SEMs.
RESULTS
Study participation and compliance
A total of 42 volunteers were randomly assigned to in-
terventions, of whom 38 completed the study. Four partici-
pants withdrew during the study [2 subjects dropped out because
of a dislike of calcium caseinate, 1 subject dropped out because of
a dislike of whey protein, and 1 subject dropped out because of
a loss of interest (see Figure 1 for flowchart)]. Table 1 sum-
marizes the baseline characteristics of completing participants.
On the basis of sachet counting, compliance was 91.0% 6 1.7%,
88.6% 6 2.1%, and 91.8% 6 1.4% for whey protein, calcium-
caseinate, and control consumption, respectively (n = 38); and on
the basis of tick-sheet recordings, compliance was 91.7% 6
1.9%, 89.9% 6 2.2%, and 93.6% 6 1.8% for whey protein,
calcium-caseinate, and control consumption, respectively (n = 37;
1 volunteer failed to complete the form). There were no signifi-
cant differences between intervention proteins and the control in
terms of compliance assessed both with the use of a sachet count
(overall treatment effect: P = 0.400) and tick sheet (overall
treatment effect: P = 0.545).
Anthropometric measurements
The body composition of participants remained stable during
interventions, and there were no significant treatment effects on
those variables (for details, see Supplemental Table 2).
Twenty-four-hour AMBP
For the primary outcome 24-h AMBP, there were significant
overall treatment effects (P = 0.027) (Table 2). Whey-protein
consumption reduced 24-h SBP to a greater extent than did
the control and also reduced daytime SBP compared with the
effect of calcium caseinate (P = 0.048), and there was a ten-
dency for lower daytime SBP after whey-protein supplemen-
tation than after control intake (P = 0.053). Similarly, whey
protein lowered 24-h DBP compared with the effect of the
control (P = 0.050) and lowered daytime DBP compared with
the effect of calcium caseinate (P = 0.035), and there was
a tendency for lower daytime DBP compared with the effect of
the control (P = 0.077). No treatment effect was seen for
nighttime SBP, DBP, pulse pressure, or heart rate. However,
there was a significant treatment effect for clinic SBP, whereby
whey protein decreased SBP compared with the effect of
maltodextrin (Table 2; for heart-rate and pulse-pressure results,
see Supplemental Table 3).

 Vascular function
There was a significant treatment effect on the %FMD
whereby both whey protein and calcium caseinate increased
the %FMD compared with the effect of the control. The aug-
mentation index, which is a measure of arterial stiffness, was not
affected by the study drinks; however, compared with the control,
whey protein reduced both peripheral and central systolic and
mean pressures. Other measures of arterial stiffness that were
assessed with the use of the DVP were not different between
treatment groups (Table 3).
Blood analyses
There was a significant reduction in total cholesterol after
whey protein and calcium-caseinate consumption than after
control intake. Triacylglycerol also decreased significantly in the
whey-protein group compared with in the control group and
almost reached significance (P = 0.055) between calcium ca-
seinate and the control. No difference was seen on any other
components of the lipid profile or indexes of insulin resistance
and sensitivity. Although whey protein, compared with the

 control, lowered soluble intercellular adhesion molecule-1
(sICAM-1) significantly, calcium caseinate reduced soluble vas-
cular cell adhesion molecule 1 (sVCAM-1). The protein supple-
ments had no effects on any inflammatory markers or on plasma
nitric oxide and serum ACE activity (Table 4).
Diet
No overall treatment effect was observed for nutrient intake
apart from that for protein (higher for the milk-protein groups
than for the control group), carbohydrate (higher for the control
than for the whey protein and casein), and calcium intake (higher
for the calcium-caseinate group than for the whey-protein and
control groups) (Table 5). On the basis of the FFQ, the mean 6
SEM milk intake of participants was 312 6 33 mL/d; con-
sumption of yogurt, fromage frais, and other dairy desserts was
74 6 13 mL/d; cheese intake was 19.3 6 3.2 g/d; and butter
consumption was 2.8 6 0.6 g/d.
ACEi effects of study drinks: in vitro study
ACEi effects of the intervention products are presented in
Supplemental Figure 2. Whey-protein permeate exhibited sig-
nificant ACEi activity compared with that of calcium-caseinate
permeate, control permeate and of undigested gastric digesta
and retentate for whey protein, calcium caseinate, and the
control.
DISCUSSION
This novel study revealed that the consumption of whey
protein (56 g/d) for 8 wk resulted in clinically relevant reductions
in 24-h SBP (22.9 6 1.1 mm Hg) and DBP (22.0 6 0.7 mm Hg)
compared with the effect of the control in adults with pre-
hypertension and mild hypertension. To date, only a very
limited number of studies have evaluated the effects of intact
dairy proteins on BP. Although Pal and Ellis (7) did not use 24-h
AMBP, our findings support their data relating to the efficacy of
whey protein to reduce BP. However, contrary to their findings,
we did not detect changes in BP after calcium-caseinate sup-
plementation. Although clinic BP may be considered less reli-
able in relation to future cardiovascular mortality and morbidity
(30, 31), we also showed a significant decrease in clinic SBP
after whey-protein supplementation than after control intake.
The inhibition of ACE has been proposed as a potential mech-
anism by which dairy proteins reduce BP (32). Data from our in
vitro study confirmed the significant ACEi activity of whey
protein compared with that of calcium caseinate and the control.
However, a reduction in circulating ACE activity was not ob-
served in the intervention study, possibly because of a lack of
power, and further studies are require to confirm the importance
of ACEi in BP reduction by whey protein.
Significant improvements in the %FMD response after both
whey protein and calcium-caseinate supplementation compared
with after control intake were also observed, thereby supporting
previous studies (33, 34). FMD is the gold standard for endo-
thelial dysfunction assessment and provides additional, in-
dependent prognostic data beyond the classic CVD-risk factors
(35). It has been estimated that the clinical significance of
consuming whey protein and calcium caseinate for 8 wk would be
7.7% and 1.4% reductions in future CVD events, respectively

WHEY IMPROVES CARDIOMETABOLIC MARKERS

 (36). Nitric oxide has been recognized as a mediator of vessel
dilation (37). However, we observed no differences in plasma
NO2 or NO3 between intervention products, thereby confirming
previous data (33). Nevertheless, it has been proposed that
vascular dilation is not solely related to nitric oxide (38). Indeed,
inflammatory markers and cell adhesion molecules have also
been associated with the progression of atherosclerosis and en-
dothelial dysfunction (39). During atherosclerotic plaque for-
mation, inflammatory cells, circulatory soluble adhesion molecules
(such as sICAM-1 and sVCAM-1), and cell surface adhesion
molecules (E-selectin and P-selectin) are activated (40). We
showed a significant decrease in sVCAM-1 and sICAM-1 after
calcium-caseinate and whey-protein consumption, respectively,
than after control intake. This result suggests that the beneficial
effects of dairy proteins on adhesion molecules may be a po-
tential mechanism for improvements in vascular reactivity. This
outcome is in agreement with a recent review that summarized
the acute and chronic effects of dietary proteins on markers of
inflammation and adhesion molecules and reported a reduction
in sICAM after a 4-wk high-protein diet compared with the
effect of maltodextrin (41).
In contrast with our study, Pal and Ellis (7) reported a decrease
in the augmentation index after whey-protein supplementation.
Nevertheless, we showed significant decreases in systolic and
mean arterial pressures of both peripheral and central pressures
that were assessed with the use of a pulse-wave analysis. This
result is an important finding because emerging evidence sug-
gests that aortic pressure is more strongly related to future
cardiovascular events than is brachial pressure (42–44) because
organs such as the heart, brain, and kidneys are exposed to
central pressure rather than peripheral pressure (45). Further-
more, the mean arterial pressure has been proposed to be a pre-
dictor of stroke (46). Note that, in our study, each intervention
period lasted for 8 wk as opposed to in the study of Pal and Ellis
(7), which was a 12-wk intervention. At week 6, Pal and Ellis (7)
showed no significant treatment effects on the augmentation
index, which suggests that a longer intervention period may
have been required for significant changes to the augmentation
index to be shown. This possibility has been supported by
Jauhiainen et al. (47) who reported a lower augmentation index
after lactotripeptide consumption in a 12-wk trial. In contrast,
improvements in the pulse-wave velocity (which is another
measure of arterial stiffness) after 6 and 8 wk of supplementa-
tion with lactotripeptides were observed (48, 49).
A significant decrease in total cholesterol after both whey
protein and calcium-caseinate supplementation was observed as
were reductions in triacylglycerol after whey-protein consump-
tion. In our recent review, we identified 4 RCTs and a pilot study
that evaluated the long-term effects of dairy proteins on lipid
metabolism (50). Our results are in agreement with the majority
of these studies (51–53); however, we failed to detect a decrease
in LDL cholesterol or an increase in HDL cholesterol. Longer
supplementation periods with milk proteins may have been more
informative on the relative effects of dairy proteins on other lipid
profiles or on the strength of significance. Calcium intake from
dairy has been associated with calcium–fatty acid soap forma-
tion in the gastrointestinal tract, which leads to reduced fat ab-
sorption (54, 55); thus, calcium intake may well be a mechanism
of action for the lipid-lowering effects of calcium caseinate.
Although calcium has been linked with a favorable effect on BP
(56), calcium-caseinate supplementation had no significant ef-
fect on BP despite containing .2.5-fold higher calcium than
whey protein. Other potential mechanisms of action have been
linked with both whey protein and calcium-caseinate con-
sumption. These mechanisms include the inhibition of genes
that are involved in fatty-acid and cholesterol absorption and

 synthesis in the intestines (57, 58), increased catabolic metab-
olism via urinary excretion of tricarboxylic acid cycle com-
pounds (59), and the stimulation of gut-bacteria activity
resulting in higher short-chain fatty acids (60), which have been
proposed as key regulatory metabolites in lipid metabolism (61).
There was no change in body weight or dietary intake apart from
the inclusion of study products during the intervention. Isoenergetic
intake was successfully achieved through diligent dietetic man-
agement, which increased the motivation and compliance of our
participants. The habitual milk and dairy consumption of the par-
ticipants was similar to that of the United Kingdom population (62)
and confirmed that the favorable effects of dairy proteins were
observed in individuals who habitually consume dairy foods.
To blind the study, maltodextrin was chosen as an appropriate
control because it was flavorless and easily dissolved and had an
energy content that matched that of the milk proteins. However,
the maltodextrin may not have been inert and could have
influenced some of the variables measure, which could have been
a potential limitation of the study. Nevertheless, the differences
observed between the whey protein and calcium-caseinate groups
confirmed the effects attributed to the specific properties of the
proteins rather than to the differences between macronutrients.
Another potential limitation was that the daily dose given in this
trial was relatively high, and therefore further studies are required
to determine the lowest effective dose of dairy proteins.
In conclusion, this novel RCT has several important obser-
vations. Compared with the control, whey protein significantly
lowered 24-h SBP and DBP, central and peripheral SBP, and
mean arterial pressure. Furthermore, compared with the control,
both whey protein and calcium caseinate improved endothelial
function, reduce adhesion molecules and vascular biomarkers of
risk, and improved blood lipids. The magnitude of changes in the
CVD risk markers observed is modest but may have important
implications for public health.
