Abstract
Silymarin (SM), and its flavonolignan components, alter cellular metabolism and inhibit
inflammatory status in human liver and T cell lines. In this study, we hypothesized that SM
suppresses both acute and chronic immune activation (CIA), including in the context of HIV
infection. SM treatment suppressed the expression of T cell activation and exhaustion mark-
ers on CD4+ and CD8+ T cells from chronically-infected, HIV-positive subjects. SM also
showed a trend towards modifying CD4+ T cell memory subsets from HIV+ subjects. In the
HIV-negative setting, SM treatment showed trends towards suppressing pro-inflammatory
cytokines from non-activated and pathogen-associated molecular pattern (PAMP)-activated
primary human monocytes, and non-activated and cytokine- and T cell receptor (TCR)-acti-
vated mucosal-associated invariant T (MAIT) cells. The data suggest that SM elicits broad
anti-inflammatory and immunoregulatory activity in primary human immune cells. By using
novel compounds to alter cellular inflammatory status, it may be possible to regulate inflam-
mation in both non-disease and disease states.
Introduction
Inflammation is a protective and reparative response that is induced by pathogen or host-
derived engagement of pattern recognition receptors (PRR) as well as through the engagement
of cytokine and non-cytokine cellular receptors [1, 2]. Receptor activation triggers cellular sig-
nal transduction, causing production and release of pro-inflammatory cytokines and chemo-
kines from cells, which in turn, recruits immune effector cells to the site of inflammation.
Upon resolution of infection and/or damage, inflammatory responses normally return to

 baseline. Human immune cells are on the front line of many inflammatory responses, and
include CD4+ and CD8+ T cells, monocytes, and mucosal associated invariant T (MAIT) cells.
Temporally, monocytes and MAIT cells comprise the initial innate phase of an inflammatory
response, while CD4+ and CD8+ comprise the adaptive phase and require proper inflamma-
tory cues (from MAIT cells or monocytes) for their effector function, the quality of the
immune response, and formation of a memory population. Dysregulated inflammation inter-
rupts this regimented, temporal process.
In the case of persistent infections, dysregulated inflammation is maintained, establishing a
state of chronic immune activation (CIA), which can lead to various disease states. Chronic
HIV infection, despite the effective control of viremia with antiretroviral therapy (ART), is a
state of CIA that leads to a host of inflammatory disorders in many infected patients [3]. With
CIA, memory T cell effector functions are lost, inhibitory factors are induced, and immune
cell metabolism is altered [4]. In both ART-treated and untreated HIV-infected individuals,
CIA is associated with significantly elevated immune activation markers [5], various inflam-
matory diseases [6], cardiovascular diseases [7], both AIDS-defining and non-AIDS defining
cancers [8], as well as HIV disease progression and mortality [9].
CIA in the context of HIV infection may be due to several factors [10] and can be assessed
by measuring exhaustion or proliferation markers on immune cells [11], changes in immune
cell inflammatory function [12], and the loss of the CD4+ T-cell population causing in an
inverted CD4+/CD8+ ratio [13]. For example, the activation marker, CD38, on CD8+ and
CD4+ T cells, is considered one of the best correlates for disease progression [14]. Pro-
grammed cell death protein (PD-1), which is highly expressed on exhausted T cells, is also
upregulated in T cells in HIV-infected persons [15]. As such, various approaches have been
used to reduce CIA including direct blockade of cellular exhaustion markers, such as targeting
PD-1 and cytotoxic T lymphocyte antigen 4 (CTLA4) [16]. In addition to targeting exhaustion
markers, dysregulated inflammation has also been shown to be suppressed with anti-inflam-
matory drugs such as aspirin [17], chloroquine [18], prednisone [6], and statins [19], all of
which have been shown to reduce some parameters of CIA.
Silymarin (SM) is an herbal extract derived from the seeds of the milk thistle plant Silybum
marianum [L.] Gaertn. [Asteraceae] and is frequently consumed by HCV- and HIV-infected
subjects [20]. SM is known to suppress HCV infection in vitro [21–25] while an intravenous
formulation of silibinin (a major component of SM) inhibits HCV replication in vivo [26–29],
and inhibits HIV-1 infection in vitro [30]. In addition to its antiviral activities, SM suppresses
various inflammation pathways: including inhibition of pro-inflammatory signaling pathways
(e.g., NF-κB and forkhead box O [FOXO]), and the expression of pro-inflammatory cytokines
and chemokines (e.g., CXCL1, CXCL2, CXCL8, CXCL10, IL-1, TNF-α [21, 22, 31, 32]. Fur-
thermore, SM treatment blocks T cell activation [21, 22, 24, 33] and PHA-induced activation
of peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC) in vitro [30].
In this study, we explored the in vitro anti-inflammatory and immunomodulatory activities
of SM in different primary human immune cells and contexts, including monocytes, MAIT
cells, and T cells from HIV-infected and non-infected subjects.
Materials and methods
Silymarin preparation
Powdered extract (Product No. 345066, Lot No. 286061) of the seeds (achenes) of Silybum
marianum [L.] Gaertn. was obtained from Euromed, S.A. (Barcelona, Spain), which is a part of
the Madaus Group (Cologne, Germany). To eliminate stability concerns with freeze-thawing
solutions of SM and the hygroscopic nature of DMSO, single use aliquots of SM were prepared

 as described [34, 35]. SM was reconstituted to a concentration of 10 mM in MeOH (based on a
molecular weight of 482 g/mol for the seven main flavonolignan diastereoisomers). Then,
100 μL of this solution was dispensed into 0.7 mL microcentrifuge tubes and allowed to freeze-
dry overnight, imparting 0.482 mg of SM per tube. The dried aliquots were stored at -20˚C.
Single-use aliquots of silymarin were reconstituted in 40 μL of DMSO and extensively vortexed
to generate a 25 mM stock solution. DMSO solvent controls ([DMSO] � 0.3%) were used for
all experiments.
Monocyte and MAIT cell isolation and culture
Human monocytes were isolated from cryopreserved PBMCs from HIV-negative subjects
using MACS CD14 Microbeads (Miltenyi Biotec, Bergisch Gladbach, Germany). CD14
+ monocytes were rested or stimulated with LPS, a TLR4 agonist, or ssRNA, a TLR8 agonist,
and then treated with SM or DMSO for 24 hours, followed by supernatant collection, and then
analyzed by Luminex. Following the CD14 microbead isolation of monocytes, the remaining
cells were stained with antibodies against CD161 and Va7.2 and MAIT cells were isolated by
FACS [29]. MAIT cells were rested, stimulated with IL-12/15/18 (100ng/ml each) or stimu-
lated with anti-CD3/CD28 beads (Dynabeads, Invitrogen) + IL-12/15/18 as described [36].
Rested and stimulated MAIT cells were incubated with or without SM. Cellular phenotypes
were assessed based on marker expression (measured by flow cytometry) and cellular function
was based on cytokine production (measured by Intracellular Cytokine Stain [ICS] assay).
PBMC samples and culturing
PBMC samples from HIV-infected subjects were obtained from the University of Washington
(UW) Center for AIDS Research (CFAR) Specimen Repository. All PBMC specimens are
linked to comprehensive clinical data within the UW HIV Information System allowing the
identification of patients who HIV-positive and receiving ART, or HIV-positive and ART-
naïve or not on ART at the time of donation. Inclusion and exclusion criteria and subject char-
acteristics are listed in Tables 1 and 2.

 HIV+ cryopreserved PBMC were thawed in a 37˚C water bath, transferred to a 50 ml coni-
cal tube containing 10 ml of R10 medium (RPMI 1640 with 25 mM HEPES buffer and L-gluta-
mate [Gibco BRL Life Technologies, Waltham, MA, USA; 10% fetal bovine serum [FBS;
Gemini Bio-products, West Sacramento, CA, USA], and Penicillin-Streptomcyin [Gibco BRL
Life Technologies, Waltham, MA, USA]), centrifuged at 250 x g for 10 minutes, and the cell
pellet was resuspended in R10 medium. Cell count and viability were determined using a
Guava Viacount (EMD Millipore, Billerica, MA, USA), resuspended to approximately 2 x 106
cells/ml in PBS (Gibco BRL Life Technologies, Waltham, MA, USA), and stained for flow
cytometry analysis ex vivo or prepared for culture including treatment with SM (at 80 μM) or
DMSO (as a vehicle control) for 72 hours at 37˚C. After 72 hours in culture, cell counts and
viability were again measured prior to marker staining and flow cytometry. Thirty-three sam-
ples were initially evaluated, and eight samples were excluded because of low viability. Thus,
statistical analyses are based on samples from 25 subjects.
Eleven-color polychromatic flow cytometry
Using an 11-marker flow cytometry antibody panel (listed in Table 3), we assessed CD4+ and
CD8+ T cell phenotypes by measuring the expression of activation and exhaustion markers in
HIV+ PBMC. We adopted our protocol as described previously [37]. Samples were stained with
Aqua Live/Dead Fixable Dead Cell Stain (AViD; [38]) then surface-stained with antibodies
against CD25, CD38, CD127, CTLA4, HLA-DR, and PD1. Cells were then fixed and permeabi-
lized using FIX & PERM Cell Fixation and Cell Permeabilization Kit (ThermoFisher Scientific,
Waltham, MA, USA). Cells were stored at -80˚C in the dark overnight in FACS Wash (PBS
with 2% FBS) following permeabilization. The following day, cells were thawed at 37˚C for 10
minutes, and then intracellular staining was performed with antibody against CD3, CD4, CD8,
and Ki67. Following intracellular staining, cells were stored at 4˚C in PBS with 2% paraformal-
dehyde until samples were acquired on an LSRII BD flow cytometer using BD FACSDiva soft-
ware (BD Biosciences). Flow cytometric analyses were performed using FlowJo version 9 (Tree
Star). Criteria for evaluable responses were determined as previously described [39].
S1 Fig shows the gating and staining strategy to identify CD4+ and CD8+ cells and activa-
tion and exhaustion markers. A timing gate was used to minimize exclusion events, and dead
cells were excluded using the AViD (i.e., amine reactive dye) stain. In addition, single cell pop-
ulations were gated, and within the lymphocyte gate, CD3+ cells were identified followed by

 gating on CD4+ or CD8+ cells. Using the OMIP-025 panel [48], a subset of HIV+ PBMC sam-
ples (N = 4) were separately stained using a T cell differentiation and memory panel. All HIV
+ PBMC, in both panels, were stained with LIVE/DEAD1 Fixable Aqua Dead Cell Stain Kit
(ThermoFisher Scientific, Waltham, MA, USA), washed, and stained with the activation/
exhaustion or differentiation/memory staining panels.
Luminex experiments
Seven chronically-infected, HIV+ PBMC samples were thawed and treated with SM (80 μM)
or DMSO (vehicle control), cultured for 72 hours, with supernatants added to a final 1% Tri-
ton-X (Sigma-Aldrich, St. Louis, MO, USA) concentration, and then processed for Luminex
analysis. The Cytokine Laboratory, a Shared Resource of the Fred Hutchinson Cancer
Research Center, processed the Luminex samples.
Statistical analyses
For MAIT cells and monocyte experiments, differences in cytokine production were assessed
by paired Wilcoxon signed rank tests. Twenty-five PBMC samples were included in the final
flow cytometry analyses. We measured changes in marker expression on cells with SM treat-
ment relative to DMSO alone, and computed absolute differences in percentages of marker
expression (i.e., SM minus DMSO treatments). Subsequently, we assessed non-parametrically
whether differences in expected expression tended to be statistically significantly different from
zero, using a Wilcoxon signed rank test. Differences in expression with SM treatment minus
expression with DMSO-only treatment are negative if SM reduced expression and positive if it
increased expression. For markers showing a significant expression reduction with SM (versus
DMSO), we also used Spearman’s correlation to assess whether expression reduction was asso-
ciated with continuous measures like age and CD4:CD8 ratio; and we used Wilcoxon rank sum
test to assess whether expression reduction was associated with binary factors like ART use.
Results
We have previously shown that SM prevents activation and inflammatory responses in CD4+
and CD8+ T cells from both non-infected and HCV-infected subjects [21, 22, 32]. Therefore,

 in the current study, we first investigated the effects of SM on other primary human immune
cells from non-infected donors stimulated in the context of different triggers of inflammation.
SM treatment showed a trend for reduced levels of MIP1-α, MIP1-β, IL-1α, IL1-β, RANTES,
and TNF-α production from both non-stimulated and PAMP-stimulated monocytes (Fig 1).
Due to the small sample size (i.e., 3 donors), the observed effect did not reach statistical
significance.
Mucosal-associated invariant T (MAIT) cells have a memory-like phenotype, make up one
to eight percent of circulating T cells, and are activated by IL-12, 15, and 18 to produce pro-
inflammatory cytokines TNF-α and IFN-γ, and granzyme B [49, 50]. SM treatment also
showed a trend for suppressing basal, cytokine (IL-12, 15, and 18), and cytokine and TCR-
mediated (IL-12, 15, and 18 plus anti-CD3/28 beads) IFN-γ and Granzyme B in CD8+ MAIT
cells (Fig 2). For this small sample size of three donors, the effects did not reach statistical sig-
nificance. The data suggest that SM treatment suppresses inflammation in resting and PAMP-,
cytokine-, and TCR-activated primary human monocyte and CD8+ MAIT cell types.
In the current study, we interrogated expression of traditional activation markers of CIA
(e.g., HLA-DR and CD38), as well as other markers of T-cell activation (e.g., Ki-67 [30]) and
markers for T-cell exhaustion, including PD-1 and CTLA-4 [40] using our flow cytometry
panel (Table 3). We analyzed the effect of SM treatment on T cell marker expression from 25
human PBMC samples (Table 2) including: four HIV-negative subjects, and 21 subjects who
were HIV-positive (i.e., 14 subjects were on ART and seven subjects were not on ART). We
used a dose of 80μM SM, which we have previously shown to be non-toxic to human cells [31].
We monitored cell viability of all PBMC cultures, determined as the percentage of AViD-nega-
tive cells. Using a Wilcoxon paired test, the 80μM dose of SM, after 72 hours of ex vivo cell cul-
ture, induced a small, but significant (p<0.0001) decrease in viability: the median decrease of
viability due to SM treatment relative to DMSO was 7%, (IQR [2%–12%]). Twenty-five PBMC
samples had greater than 50% viability and were included in statistical analyses. Moreover, all
flow cytometry data described below are based on viable cells.

 SM treatment reduced the expression of activation markers in HIV-negative and HIV-
positive T cells (Table 4 and S2 Fig). Specifically, SM treatment significantly reduced the
expression of CD38+/HLA-DR+ (compared to DMSO) in both CD4+ and CD8+ T cells (i.e.,
difference of -0.7%; median IQR [-1.1% to -0.4%]; p-value = 0.001) and (-0.6%; [-1.7% to
-0.3%]; p-value = 0.0003), respectively (Fig 3). SM caused a greater suppression of CD38
+/HLA-DR+ expression on T cells from ART-naïve patients as compared to patients on ART.
This effect was observed on both CD4+ (p-value = 0.001) and CD8+ (p-value = 0.0074) T cells
(S3A–S3D Fig).
In the CD4+ T cell population, the median difference in CD38+/HLA-DR+ expression
between SM and DMSO treated cells was -1.3% (IQR -1.8% to -1.1%) for ART-naïve individu-
als and was -0.5% (IQR -0.7% to -0.2%) for subjects on ART (S2A and S2B Fig). In the CD8+
T cell population, the median difference of CD38+ and HLA-DR+ expression between SM
and DMSO treated cells was -3.3% (-8.0% to -0.9%) for ART-naïve individuals and was 0.4%
(IQR -0.8% to 0.1%) for subjects on ART (S2C and S2D Fig). Lower CD4:CD8 ratio was asso-
ciated with a significant decrease in CD38+ and HLA-DR+ expression on SM versus DMSO
treated CD8+ T cells (Spearman’s rho = 0.65, p-value = 0.002; S2E and S2F Fig) but was not
significantly associated with a decrease on CD4+ T cells (Spearman’s rho = 0.37, p = 0.095).
There were no age-related associations in the difference of CD38+/HLA-DR+ expression for
either CD4+ or CD8+ T cells (p = 0.27 and p = 0.34, respectively).
SM treatment also suppressed the expression of T cell exhaustion markers, CTLA4 and
PD1 (Table 4 and S3 Fig). Specifically, CTLA4+/PD1+ expression on CD4+ T cells was signifi-
cantly reduced by SM treatment in comparison to DMSO (difference of -0.9%; IQR [21.9% to
0.5%]; p-value = 0.037; Table 4, Fig 3). These effects were limited to CD4+ T cells, as SM did
not significantly reduce these markers on CD8+ T cells (p = 0.32). Moreover, the reduction of
CTLA4+/PD1+ on CD4+ T cells by SM treatment was strongly associated with CD4:CD8 ratio
(Spearman’s rho = 0.57; p-value = 0.010; S3A and S3B Fig). As with CD38+/HLA-DR+ mark-
ers, no association of CTLA4+/PD1+ markers was observed with age (p = 0.79). However, SM
reduction of CTLA4+/PD1+ markers on CD4+ T cells was greater in magnitude in PBMC
samples from individuals that were ART-naïve (median difference of -24.2%; IQR [-31.8–
21.0%]) versus those that were receiving ART (-0.1% [IQR -6.4% to 0.4%], Wilcoxon test,
p = 0.037) (S3C and S3D Fig).

 After 72 hours in culture, SM did not significantly alter the expression of the activation
marker Ki67 in CD4+ and CD8+ T cells (Table 4; S4A and S4B Fig). In addition, SM treatment
did not have any significant effect on CD4+ regulatory T cell markers (i.e., Tregs; defined as
CD25+/CD127lo CD4+ T cells; p-value = 0.71), while SM treatment marginally reduced the
expression of CD25+/CD127lo on CD8+ T cells (p-value = 0.046) (Table 4; S4C and S4D Fig).
To determine if SM treatment results in the inhibition of T cell pro-inflammatory function,
a subset of chronically infected, HIV+ PBMC culture supernatants were harvested after 72
hours of culture in SM or DMSO and processed for Luminex analyses. As shown in S5 Fig,
SM treatment suppressed IL-18 and IL-6 expression in cultures, whereas the effect of SM on
IL-8 expression was variable.
The chemokine receptor CCR7 and the tyrosine phosphatase CD45RA are used to desig-
nate T cells as naïve (CD45RA+/CCR7+), terminal effector (CD45RA+/CCR7-), central mem-
ory (CD45RA-/CCR7+), and effector memory (CD45RA-/CCR7-) cells [51, 52]. While not
statistically significant due to the low number of samples (N = 4), SM treatment showed a
trend for increasing the percentage of naïve CD4+ T cells (defined as CD4+ cells expressing
CD45RA+/CCR7+ markers) in comparison to DMSO treatment (Fig 4). SM treatment also
showed a trend towards reducing the percentage of CD4 T cells in the terminal effector and
effector memory cell subsets.
Discussion
In this study, we show that SM significantly reduces expression of various markers of T cell
activation and exhaustion (e.g., CD38, HLA-DR, CTLA4, and PD1) as well as pro-inflamma-
tory cytokines (e.g., IL-6 and IL-18) in PBMCs from chronically-infected HIV-positive sub-
jects. SM treatment also showed a trend towards maintaining naïve CD4+ T cell populations
in cultured PBMC from chronically infected, HIV+ subjects. For monocytes and MAIT cells
in the HIV-negative setting, SM treatment showed trends toward reducing pro-inflammatory
cytokines in resting/non-stimulated, and cytokine-, PAMP-, and TCR-activated cultures.

hours of treatment with SM (80 μM; empty symbols) or DMSO (vehicle control; solid symbols), PBMC were
analyzed by flow cytometry for CD4+ T cell differentiation markers, defined as follows: A, Naïve (CD45RA
+/CCR7+), B, Terminal Effector (CD45RA+/CCR7-), C, Effector Memory (CD45RA-/CCR7-), and D, Central
Memory (CD45RA-/CCR7+).

Broad, anti-inflammatory effects of silymarin on primary human cells

 While interesting, these effects of SM on monocytes, MAIT cells, and T cell memory subsets
need to be bolstered in future studies by studying larger numbers of samples. Nevertheless, the
data indicate that the inflammatory status of primary human immune cells, in both resting
and stimulus-activated conditions, is suppressed by SM.
Similar to activation and exhaustion markers, SM suppression of PAMP-induced inflam-
mation in monocytes may be important during CIA. For example, monocyte activation has
been associated with systemic inflammation, atherosclerosis, and the development of prema-
ture cardiovascular disease [53], all of which occur at a higher rate in the HIV-infected com-
munity [54, 55].
The effects of SM treatment may not only be applicable to monocytes and T cells in the con-
text of HIV infection, as SM treatment may also be effective for the suppression of MAIT acti-
vation involved in resetting pathologic inflammation. Multiple studies have shown that CD8
+ MAITs contribute to the primary, innate-like response against bacterial and fungal infec-
tions and can be activated by inflammatory stimuli [36, 56]. The suppression of CD8+ MAIT
cell activation, as shown here by SM treatment, is not limited to that caused by acute bacterial
infections, but may also be important during chronic viral infections, such as HIV: circulating
MAIT cells are severely reduced in chronically-infected HIV+ patients, and fail to completely
restore to pre-infection frequencies with ART [57]. Moreover, these MAIT cells showed a
functionally exhausted phenotype. Our data suggest that by treating MAIT cells with SM and
reducing their inflammatory response, it may be possible to reduce the MAIT-associated
exhausted phenotype, preserving their function in both the blood and at epithelial sites, such
as in the context of chronic viral infections.
The reduction of the T cell activation markers CD38 and HLA-DR by SM was correlated
with a low CD4:CD8 ratio (i.e., < 1) and in PBMC from subjects not on ART. In the setting of
chronic HIV infection, clinical parameters such as CD4:CD8 ratio have been used to identify
HIV+ individuals on ART who are at greater risk of immune dysfunction, leading to AIDS,
non-AIDS events, and mortality [58]. Thus, natural products like SM may be effective in
reducing CIA that is associated with AIDS, non-AIDS events, and mortality. In addition to the
traditional activation markers CD38+/HLA-DR+, the reduction of exhaustion markers
CTLA4 and PD1 by SM may also be clinically relevant in the context of HIV-associated CIA.
For example, blocking PD-1 receptor function during simian immunodeficiency virus in vivo
was shown to improve virus-specific CD8+ T cell responses, reduce plasma viremia, as well as
increase animal survival [59]. In fact, by inhibiting multiple immune exhaustion pathways
(e.g., PD-1 and CTLA4) simultaneously, T cell function can further be improved [60], suggest-
ing potential additive or synergistic therapies for recovery of immune function. In the context
of chronic HIV infection, the ability of SM to reduce CTLA4 and PD1 expression is particu-
larly interesting, since cells with high-level expression of exhaustion markers may preferen-
tially harbor latent, HIV proviral DNA [61].
The ability of SM to quell various types of inflammation is similar to the immunomodula-
tory effects of metabolic modulators like rapamycin, which can suppress cellular activation,
stimulus-induced inflammation, and alter immune cell fate (i.e. differentiation). Rapamycin’s
principle mechanism of action is via inhibition of mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR)
through its association with FKBP12 [62, 63]. We have recently shown that SM also inhibits
mTOR by at least two pathways, involving activation of adenosine monophosphate kinase
(AMPK) and induction of DNA Damage Inducible Transcript 4 (DDIT4), a novel inhibitor of
mTOR [31]. Moreover, SM activates AMPK signaling, which feeds forward to suppress NF-κB
signaling [31]. Thus, SM appears to modulate multiple metabolic pathways that converge on
suppressing inflammation in diverse immune cell types, independent of the inflammatory
insult or stimulus.
