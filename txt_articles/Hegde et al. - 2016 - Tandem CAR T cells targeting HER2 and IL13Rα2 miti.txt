Introduction
Adoptive transfer of chimeric antigen receptor–grafted (CAR-
grafted) (1) T cells has induced tumor regression in several pre-
clinical models of glioblastoma (GBM) (2–4), osteosarcoma (5, 6), 
and neuroblastoma (7). However, only sporadic clinical responses 
have been observed in early-phase clinical trials for these tumors 
(8–11). In contrast, the sustained remission seen in preclinical 
models of CAR T cell transfer in B cell leukemia was successfully 
translated to favorable outcomes in early clinical trials. These suc-
cesses were achieved by targeting of CD19, a B-cell lineage marker 
that is uniformly expressed in B cell precursor acute lymphoblastic 
leukemia and chronic lymphocytic leukemia cells (12–19). Expla-
nations for this discrepancy include but are not limited to transient 
T cell persistence in vivo, modest T cell homing, and inadequate T 
cell activation and/or T cell inhibition at the tumor site (8, 9). The 
limited spectrum of T cell specificity in the face of the heteroge-
neous and potentially dynamic antigen landscape is perhaps the 
biggest challenge for CAR T cell therapy for solid tumors (20–24).
We previously reported on GBM’s markedly heterogeneous 
antigenic landscape (20). A mathematical model of the expres-
sion hierarchy of 3 validated glioma antigens (21, 25–28), HER2, 
IL13Rα2, and EphA2, predicted enhanced odds of tumor elimi-
nation on targeting of any 2 of these 3 antigens (20). Specifically, 
while targeting HER2 or IL13Rα2 alone predicted a 60%–70% 
probability of near-complete tumor elimination, simultaneously 
targeting HER2 and IL13Rα2 was predicted to eliminate more than 
90% in a cohort of 20 primary GBMs (20).
We reasoned that a single CAR molecule with docking capac-
ity to 2 tumor-associated antigens (TAAs) will form a bivalent T 
cell/GBM immunological synapse (IS), enhancing T cell activa-
tion and offsetting antigen escape, and collectively, these attri-
butes will translate into superior antitumor activity (29).
We report on a bispecific CAR molecule that incorporates 2 
antigen recognition domains for HER2 and IL13Rα2, joined in tan-
dem, thus termed TanCAR (29). We describe the design, in silico 
modeling, and super-resolution imaging of the TanCAR IS with 
GBM cells, and show functional superiority of T cells expressing 
TanCARs ex vivo and in an orthotopic GBM xenograft model.
Results
Antigen escape variants prevail in GBM recurrences after CAR T cell 
therapy. GBM exhibits substantial genetic as well as antigenic het-
In preclinical models of glioblastoma, antigen escape variants can lead to tumor recurrence after treatment with CAR 
T cells that are redirected to single tumor antigens. Given the heterogeneous expression of antigens on glioblastomas, 
we hypothesized that a bispecific CAR molecule would mitigate antigen escape and improve the antitumor activity of T 
cells. Here, we created a CAR that joins a HER2-binding scFv and an IL13Rα2-binding IL-13 mutein to make a tandem CAR 
exodomain (TanCAR) and a CD28.ζ endodomain. We determined that patient TanCAR T cells showed distinct binding to HER2 
or IL13Rα2 and had the capability to lyse autologous glioblastoma. TanCAR T cells exhibited activation dynamics that were 
comparable to those of single CAR T cells upon encounter of HER2 or IL13Rα2. We observed that TanCARs engaged HER2 
and IL13Rα2 simultaneously by inducing HER2-IL13Rα2 heterodimers, which promoted superadditive T cell activation when 
both antigens were encountered concurrently. TanCAR T cell activity was more sustained but not more exhaustible than that 
of T cells that coexpressed a HER2 CAR and an IL13Rα2 CAR, T cells with a unispecific CAR, or a pooled product. In a murine 
glioblastoma model, TanCAR T cells mitigated antigen escape, displayed enhanced antitumor efficacy, and improved animal 
survival. Thus, TanCAR T cells show therapeutic potential to improve glioblastoma control by coengaging HER2 and IL13Rα2 
in an augmented, bivalent immune synapse that enhances T cell functionality and reduces antigen escape.

expression after treatment with HER2 CAR T cells. Conversely, 
tumors maintained HER2 expression after IL13Rα2 targeting (Fig-
ure 1, B and C). Escape variants prevailed in all recurrences while 
a second targetable antigen was preserved.
Construction and in silico interrogation of the structural functional-
ity of a HER2/IL13Rα2 bivalent CAR molecule. In order to redirect the 
specificity of T cells toward both HER2 and IL13Rα2 simultaneously 
using a single CAR molecule, we constructed a TanCAR: a bivalent 
CAR molecule that can engage both TAAs by a single exodomain. 
The CAR exodomain consists of a 19–amino acid leader/secretory 
sequence (L), followed by a high-affinity IL-13 mutein that is separat-
ed from the HER2-specific FRP5-scFv by a 15–amino acid glycine/
serine repeat linker (Figure 2A and ref. 29). The composite cell bind-
ing domain is followed by an IgG1 hinge moiety (H). A CD28 trans-
membrane domain tethers this exodomain to a second-generation 
endodomain incorporating the CD28 and CD3 ζ signaling chains. 
The encoding transgene was codon-optimized, then synthesized 
and packaged into a pSFG retroviral backbone (Figure 2B).
A model for both the individual domains and the entire Tan-
CAR was constructed using the Phyre2 and RaptorX structure 
prediction websites (Figure 2C). The model suggested that each 
erogeneity. We and others have shown that experimental ortho-
topic GBM regresses after administration of HER2 or IL13Rα2 CAR 
T cells, yet tumors recur in 40%–60% of CAR T cell–treated ani-
mals (2–4, 30). Therefore, we assessed the surface expression of 
HER2 and IL13Rα2 in a cohort of 3 primary GBM samples (unique 
patient numbers 1–3 [UPN 1–UPN 3]) obtained from surgical exci-
sion material (hereafter referred to as primary GBM). Consistent 
with our previous results, variable HER2 and IL13Rα2 expression 
was observed (Figure 1A). While UPN 1 and 2 had a predominantly 
HER2- and IL13Rα2-coexpressing tumor cell population (66% and 
60%, respectively), UPN 3 had 2 distinct tumor cell populations 
with a predominant positivity for HER2 (64%). IL13Rα2 expression 
was only 11%, with 5% of the cells coexpressing both antigens.
We studied the expression of glioma antigens in recurrent 
U373 (a HER2+, IL13Rα2+ human GBM cell line) xenografts after 
adoptive transfer of either HER2 or IL13Rα2 CAR T cells using 
coimmunofluorescence for both HER2 and IL13Rα2 Recurrences 
after HER2 CAR T cell transfer showed dim to undetectable HER2 
expression. Similarly, tumors recurring after IL13Rα2 CAR T cell 
transfer showed dim staining for IL13Rα2. Interestingly, residual 
and recurrent tumors maintained and even intensified IL13Rα2

nate receptors, though distal arrangement of the IL-13 mutein may 
allow for a more exposed IL13Rα2 epitope. As there are minimal 
interactions between the domains and a relatively long glycine/
serine linker separates them, it was unclear whether this architec-
ture would persist in vivo.
Docking of the TanCAR to the cognate receptors was initially 
modeled for the individual IL-13 mutein and the FRP5-scFv (Fig-
ure 2, D and E, respectively). Models for IL-13/IL13Rα2 (Protein 
Data Bank ID: 3LB6) and HER2/FRP5-scFv were individually 
optimized with Rosetta Dock, then combined in the context of the 
domain was structurally discrete; the IL-13 mutein domain con-
tained a 4-helical cytokine fold, while the FRP5-scFv domain had 
an Ig-like β-sandwich fold (2, 3). The model for the entire Tan-
CAR did not suggest any interaction between the IL-13 mutein 
and the FRP5-scFv domain, as the intervening glycine/serine 
linker appears to separate the 2 domains. Further, this model sug-
gested a linear arrangement of the domains, in which the FRP5-
scFv domain is anchored closer to the membrane than the IL-13 
mutein. Importantly, the model suggested that the receptor bind-
ing moieties for each of the domains are likely available to the cog-

background reactivity seen with UPN 2 NT T cells is likely due to 
a less than 5% subpopulation of NK cells detected in the product.
The ability to engage both HER2 and IL13Rα2 could pro-
vide an advantage to T cell effectors over their unispecific coun-
terparts by increasing the overall avidity of the interaction. We 
assessed the cytolytic ability of TanCAR T cells, HER2 CAR T 
cells, IL13Rα2 CAR T cells, and equal aliquots of both unispecific 
CAR T cells pooled together (CARpool) and bi-expressers of both 
HER2 and IL13Rα2 CAR (biCAR) generated from patients UPN 1, 
2, and 3 (Figure 3B). In all subsequent experiments, the TanCAR 
transduction rate was normalized to the HER2 CAR– and IL13Rα2 
CAR–coexpressing T cell population in the biCAR T cell product 
and to individual CAR-expressing T cell population in unispecific 
T cell products (Supplemental Figure 1B). Significantly higher kill-
ing at most effector-to-target ratios was seen with UPN 1, 2, and 3 
TanCAR T cells compared with unispecific or biCAR T cells. UPN 
3 IL13Rα2 CAR T cells exhibited only modest cytolytic activity, 
likely because only 16% of this tumor’s cells expressed IL13Rα2. 
Similar results were seen when donor-derived T cells encountered 
the GBM cell line U373. There was no cytolytic activity by NT pri-
mary T cell blasts from the same patient and no significant cyto-
lytic activity of TanCAR T cells against HER2- and IL13Rα2-null 
targets (not shown).
In order to assess their relative cytokine secretion capacity, 
we cocultured U373 glioma cells with TanCAR, biCAR, HER2, 
IL13rα2, and CARpool T cells at a ratio of 1 T cell to 4 tumor cells. 
Supernatants were collected at 24 hours and analyzed for IL-2 and 
IFN-γ using ELISA. We detected significantly higher concentra-
tions of cytokines in supernatants in samples with TanCAR T cells 
as effectors compared with all other T cell products. Neither NT 
cells nor U373 alone had detectable levels of cytokines (Figure 3C).
TanCAR T cells are activated in a dose-dependent manner upon 
contact with either HER2 or IL13Rα2 and show superadditive activa-
tion upon encountering both HER2 and IL13Rα2. To test the speci-
ficity of TanCAR T cells and their activation dynamics, we cul-
tured them on plates coated with increasing densities of HER2.Fc, 
IL13Rα2.Fc, an irrelevant target (GD2.scFv anti-idiotype), and a 
nonspecific T cell receptor stimulant (OKT3). We compared their 
activation dynamics to those of biCAR and HER2- and IL13Rα2-
unispecific CAR T cells. The supernatant was analyzed at 24 hours 
for IFN-γ and IL-2. TanCAR T cells released IFN-γ upon encoun-
tering HER2 or IL13Rα2 (Figure 4). The magnitude of response 
was dose-dependent (r2 0.85–0.98) for both target antigens at low 
to intermediate density of immobilized HER2.Fc or IL13Rα2.Fc. 
At high antigen densities, a decline in cytokine release was noted. 
In contrast, cytokine production was significantly higher when 
TanCAR T cells encountered both TAAs simultaneously than 
either antigen alone at any antigen density (P < 0.001), and higher 
than the sum of maximal cytokine concentrations upon single 
antigen contact, denoting a superadditive effect of encountering 
both antigen molecules. In contrast, biCAR T cells exhibited simi-
lar activation dynamics upon encounter of individual antigens and 
a simple additive enhanced activation upon encounter of low to 
intermediate densities of both antigens. At high antigen densities, 
we saw a decline in both IFN-γ and IL-2 production by biCAR T 
cells. Unispecific CAR T cell products exhibited uniaxial activa-
tion dynamics with decline of cytokine production at high antigen 
full TanCAR (Figure 2F) (29). The arrangement of the TanCAR 
domains allowed for binding both receptors, simultaneously. It 
is likely that the potentially flexible linker between the domains 
would permit conformational variability of domain arrangement, 
thus allowing the IL-13 mutein and the FRP5-scFv to optimize the 
simultaneous binding of the 2 cognate receptors. Our computa-
tional modeling is indicative of 1 such arrangement. Table 1 shows 
the energy analysis of TanCAR docking.
TanCAR distinctly binds HER2 and IL13Rα2 and mediates 
enhanced T cell reactivity against autologous GBM and GBM cell lines. A 
retroviral system was used to express TanCAR onto primary human 
T cells from GBM patients (2). We used soluble HER2 and IL13Rα2 
to confirm the distinct unispecific as well as bispecific binding of 
the TanCAR exodomain to both TAAs (Supplemental Figure 1A; 
supplemental material available online with this article; doi:10.1172/
JCI83416DS1). The high concordance between the juxtamembra-
nous FRP5-scFv and the IL-13 mutein conjugates confirmed that the 
TanCAR molecule exodomain surfaced on the T cells in its entirety. 
Expression was stable for more than 12 weeks in ex vivo cultures.
We performed a coculture assay to test whether encounter-
ing autologous GBM cells would induce T cell activation. TanCAR 
T cells from UPN 1, 2, and 3 specifically secreted IFN-γ and IL-2 
upon encountering autologous GBM cells. The levels of IFN-γ and 
IL-2 were undetectable (significantly lower in UPN 2) when non-
transduced (NT) T cells were used as effectors (Figure 3A). The

cells, we used an electrical impedance-based tumor cell culture 
system (xCELLigence). U373 cells were seeded and allowed to 
reach confluence before each T cell product with matched trans-
duction efficiency was added at a ratio of 1 T cell to 10 seeded 
U373 cells. A validated impedance-based cell index formula was 
used to quantify the density of tumor cells (Figure 5A). The real-
time killing of U373 glioma cells was assessed in time-lapse over 
150 hours. Initially, both tandem and biCAR T cell products killed 
U373 significantly more effectively compared with HER2- and 
IL13Rα2 CAR T cells and their pooled product. At and beyond 60 
hours, however, TanCAR T cells were significantly better able to 
densities. T cells did not produce IFN-γ or IL-2 during coculture 
with the irrelevant GD2.scFv anti-idiotype or on uncoated sur-
faces. As expected, OKT3 (nonspecific positive control) induced 
cytokine release through stimulation of the native T cell receptor.
TanCAR T cells exhibit enhanced and sustained ex vivo antitu-
mor activity that is not associated with a more exhausted phenotype. 
Excessive stimulation of T cells, such as that seen with TanCAR 
T cells upon simultaneous encounter of both HER2 and IL13Rα2, 
can result in an initially accentuated functionality followed by 
an exhausted phenotype. To compare the duration of antitumor 
activity by TanCAR, biCAR, CARpool, and unispecific CAR T

eliminate U373 glioma cells compared with other T cell effectors 
(P < 0.05 at 80 hours and P < 0.005 at 100 hours and thereafter).
We next assessed the expression of the exhaustion mark-
ers PD-1, LAG3, and TIM3 in CD4 and CD8 compartments after 
coculture with U373 cells for 1 week at a ratio of 1 T cell to 10 tumor 
cells. U373 glioma cells were replenished at 72 hours to ensure 
continuous stimulation of T cells. T cells were gated on the basis 
of CAR expression and compared with unstimulated CAR T cells 
from the same donor. CD8+ and CD4+ compartments of all CAR T 
cell products showed significant upregulation of surface PD-1 and 
LAG3 expression following coculture with U373. Both biCAR and 
TanCAR effectors exhibited a comparable increase in PD-1 and 
LAG3 expression, similar to that seen in IL13Rα2 but not HER2 
CAR T cells. TIM3 expression was significantly lower in TanCAR 
CD4+ T cells (Figure 5B).
TanCARs heterodimerize HER2 and IL13Rα2 in an enhanced 
bivalent immune synapse. CAR T cells are required to engage 
in an active interaction with specific target antigens on tumor 
cells to form an IS, which then initiates lytic killing. To inves-
tigate whether the TanCAR cells were bivalent, we determined 
the localization of their target antigens at the CAR T cell–GBM 
contact point (Figure 6A). TanCAR, IL13Rα2 CAR, HER2 CAR, 
and NT T cells were incubated with U373-GBM cells, and then 
stained for both HER2 and IL13Rα2. The IS was reconstituted 
and visualized by stacking of 1-μm3 cubic voxels at slices span-
ning the T cell/GBM IS (Figure 6B and ref. 31). Only IL13Rα2 or 
HER2 localized to the IS for the IL13Rα2 CAR and HER2 CAR 
T cell–GBM conjugates, respectively. In contrast, both HER2 
and IL13Rα2 were found to cluster at the TanCAR IS, implying 
bivalency of the TanCAR T cells. Quantification of receptor 
accumulation at the IS revealed an increased collective cluster-
ing of both HER2 and IL13Rα2 at the TanCAR IS compared with 
unispecific T cells (P < 0.005 and P < 0.0005, respectively; Fig-
ure 6C). Further, we saw increased clustering of IL13Rα2 at the 
TanCAR T cell IS, compared with the IL13Rα2 CAR T cells (P < 
0.0002), and comparable HER2 clustering to that of HER2 CAR 
Figure 4. Dynamics of activation of 
TanCAR T cells upon encounter of a 
density gradient of HER2 and IL13Rα2. 
The activation dynamics of TanCAR T 
cells, biCAR T cells, HER2 CAR T cells, 
and IL13Rα2 CAR T cells was studied 
by seeding of the cells onto polypropyl-
ene surface-bound HER2 (range 0–2.0 
μg/ml), IL13Rα2 (range 0–20 μg/ml), 
an irrelevant target (GD2.scFv anti-
idiotype, 5 µg/ml), and OKT3 (1 µg/ml). 
Cytokine analysis (IFN-γ and IL-2) of the 
culture supernatant using ELISA was 
performed after 24 hours. Shown are 
representative data from 3 independent 
experiments done in triplicates. The 
titration included 10 antigen concentra-
tions on each axis. Two-tailed t test 
was used to compare TanCAR cytokine 
values with those for each single-speci-
ficity CAR and biCAR T cells. Significant 
results are reported in Results. Nonspe-
cific positive control OKT3 induced both 
IFN-γ (5.5 ng/ml) and IL-2 (2.0 ng/ml) 
release by TanCAR T cells while there 
was no cytokine production with GD2 
anti-idiotype.

and HER2 comparable to tumor cell only (P = 0.24 for IL13Rα2 
and P = 0.96 for HER2).
Our in silico modeling data and the ability of TanCAR mole-
cules to mediate superadditive activation of T cells prompted us to 
interrogate whether TanCAR molecules could engage both HER2 
and IL13Rα2, simultaneously. Using stimulated emission deple-
tion (STED) super-resolution microscopy that utilizes continuous-
wave microscopy, we imaged TanCAR T cell/U373 ISs. We were 
able to observe HER2 and IL13Rα2 ligand heterodimers (Figure 
7A) at the TanCAR/U373 IS at a significantly higher frequency 
compared with the biCAR/U373 IS (24% vs. <7%, respectively; 
 
P < 0.001; Figure 7B), and with a diffraction limit of less than 200 
nm. Line profiles of pixel intensity for HER2 and IL13Rα2 showed 
a high enough resolution to indicate the aggregates were suffi-
ciently proximate to support co-docking of HER2 and IL13Rα2 to 
the TanCAR exodomain (Supplemental Figure 2).
To confirm and substantiate the 2-color STED findings at the 
molecular level, we used proximity ligation assay (PLA; Duolink) 
to probe for HER2-IL13Rα2 heterodimers at the IS. PLA allows 
detection of protein-protein interaction within a proximity of less 
than 40 nm (Figure 7C, Supplemental Figure 3, and ref. 32). We 
PLA-probed TanCAR/U373 and biCAR/U373 ISs using proxim-
ity probes against HER2 (positive probe) and IL13Rα2 (negative 
probe). The presence or absence of a signal (indicating proxim-
ity of the 2 ligands at <40 nm) was then detected by confocal 
microscopy and quantified at a per-synapse level. Mean fluores-
cence intensity (MFI) of the binary signals indicated a signifi-
cantly increased presence of less-than-40-nm heterodimers at 
the TanCAR/U373 IS in comparison with the biCAR/U373 IS (P < 
0.0001). NT T cells conjugated to U373 cells were used as controls 
to detect background signal/noise levels (Figure 7D).
The IS mediated by the TanCAR molecule exhibited poten-
tially advantageous qualitative and quantitative features. We

being the most stringent clinical index of treatment failure, was 
used as the primary outcome, and both overall survival (OS) and 
tumor volume using bioluminescence imaging were secondary 
outcomes. Tumor-only and NT T cell–treated animals served as 
controls. HER2 CAR T cells and IL13Rα2 CAR T cells induced a 
transient but significant regression of GBM xenografts (Figure 9A 
and Supplemental Figure 4), with a median PFS of 14 days (range 
8–19) and 14 days (range 7–18) after treatment, respectively (P < 
0.04 vs. controls; log-rank test). TanCAR T cells extended PFS to 
36 days (range 32–110 days), P = 0.0007 (Figure 9B). The median 
OS of HER2 CAR T cells and IL13Rα2 CAR T cells was 53 days 
(range 50–56) and 55 days (range 52–57), respectively (P < 0.04 
vs. controls). TanCAR T cells extended the median OS to 86 days 
(range 80–100 days), P = 0.0002 (Figure 9C). NT T cells induced 
no appreciable tumor regression. We analyzed the expression 
of HER2 and IL13Rα2 in recurrent tumors from all groups. As 
described above, tumors recurring after unispecific CAR treat-
ment downregulated or eliminated target expression but main-
tained expression of the nontargeted antigen (20). Tumor recur-
rences after TanCAR T cell transfer were not only significantly 
smaller by bioluminescence imaging, they also had dim staining 
for both HER2 and IL13Rα2 (Figure 9, D and E).
We have previously shown that simultaneous targeting of 
HER2 and IL13Rα2 using CARpool and biCAR T cells does indeed 
result in improved tumor control (20). To assess the antitumor 
measured F-actin accumulation at the IS and polarization of 
the microtubule organizing center (MTOC), 2 well-established 
parameters for cellular cytolysis, to assess whether the TanCAR 
bivalency is associated with a functional advantage (Figure 8A). 
When compared with biCAR T cells, TanCAR T cells showed sig-
nificantly increased MTOC polarization to the IS, indicated by 
reduced distance of MTOC to IS (n ≥ 10 synapses reconstituted, 
 
P < 0.0001) as well as significantly higher F-actin accumulation 
at the IS (n ≥ 20 synapses reconstituted, P < 0.0005), thereby 
indicating a superior cytolytic potential (Figure 8B).
Collectively, our results indicate that TanCAR T cells co-recruit 
and co-bind HER2 and IL13Rα2 at the IS, and that TanCAR-medi-
ated ISs are associated with a significantly better lytic potential.
TanCAR T cells improve elimination of established orthotopic 
GBM and mitigate antigen escape. The aforementioned data sug-
gest TanCAR T cells may offer therapeutic superiority to unispe-
cific CAR T cells and other combinatorial measures, including 
CARpools and biCAR T cells. We thus assessed their antitumor 
efficacy against established GBM xenografts in 2 scenarios of an 
orthotopic murine model of human GBM.
To assess the ability of TanCAR T cells to mitigate treatment 
failure mediated by antigen escape, we performed a “stress test” 
experiment wherein relatively large GBM xenografts were treat-
ed with approximately 1 T cell for every 30 tumor cells projected 
at the time of T cell injection. Progression-free survival (PFS),

ated higher-density bispecific clustering at the IS that comprised a 
significant number of TanCAR-mediated HER2-IL13Rα2 heterodi-
mers seen on STED super-resolution microscopy and confirmed 
on a molecular level using PLA. This bivalent targeting of the Tan-
CAR T cells also offset antigen escape tumor cell variants and bet-
ter eliminated established tumors than unispecific CAR T cells, a 
pool thereof and a product of T cells coexpressing both CARs.
The TanCAR incorporates an FRP5-based scFv in the juxta-
membrane position and a high-affinity IL-13 mutein in the distal 
position (3, 20). The expression of the exodomain in its entirety 
was confirmed using flow cytometric strategies specific for both 
domains. The distinct activation of the TanCAR T cells upon 
encounter of either target indicates that the correct folding of this 
complex exodomain occurred with preservation of the electro-
static properties of the individual moieties. T cell activation, mea-
sured by IFN-γ and IL-2 secretion, was proportional to the density 
of target proteins immobilized to polypropylene surfaces.
The simultaneous encounter of both targets induced sig-
nificantly higher cytokine secretion by TanCAR T cells than did 
exposure to either of the single targets alone. The concentration of 
cytokines was higher than the simple additive effect of encounter-
ing both targets individually (in contrast to an additive effect seen 
with biCAR T cells that declined at higher antigen concentrations). 
efficacy of TanCAR T cells in comparison with these bispecifics, 
we performed a second orthotopic in vivo experiment wherein 
established orthotopic GBM xenografts were treated with approx-
imately 1 T cell for every 3 tumor cells at the time of T cell injec-
tion. Median OS was the primary outcome (Figure 10A). CARpool 
induced regression of GBM xenografts, with an OS of 52 days 
(range 45–66) after treatment (P < 0.02 vs. controls; log-rank test). 
biCAR T cells induced a significantly longer OS of 85 days (range 
57–125 days), P = 0.001 vs. CARpool. In contrast, the OS for the 
TanCAR T cells was greater than 140 days (P < 0.0001 vs. biCAR). 
The study was closed at 140 days with 0 of 5 (0%), 3 of 10 (30%), 
and 13 of 13 (100%) animals surviving in the CARpool, biCAR, 
and TanCAR groups, respectively (Figure 10B).
Collectively, these experiments demonstrate that TanCAR 
T cells improve control of established orthotopic GBM and miti-
gate antigen escape.
Discussion
We built a CAR molecule (TanCAR) specific to 2 glioma-associated 
antigens, HER2 and IL13Rα2, and found that TanCAR-transduced 
T cells distinctively and effectively recognize either antigen and 
have superior sustained activity when both targets are encountered 
simultaneously. When engaged with GBM, TanCAR T cells cre-

cells within the heterogeneous tumor subpopulations. Neverthe-
less, the general applicability of the TanCAR strategy to other tar-
gets and other extracellular binding domains remains to be estab-
lished. Further, although unlikely, it remains unknown whether 
any conformational changes induced after binding of the first 
antigen in the tandem CAR would not change the specificity of the 
second scFv for its antigen.
Speculations about co-docking of the TanCAR molecule to 
both antigens on the tumor cell surface call for imaging of indi-
vidual receptor-ligand interactions at the IS between effector and 
target cells. Imaging of clustering of proteins at the synapse, as 
reported here by us, has traditionally used confocal microscopy, 
which restricts the resolution of these images to no less than 200 
nm approximately because of the diffraction limit of light and is 
therefore not enough to look at single-molecule interactions (33). 
Our in silico modeling data and the ability of TanCAR molecules to 
mediate superadditive activation of T cells prompted us to inter-
rogate whether TanCAR molecules could indeed engage both 
HER2 and IL13Rα2, simultaneously. While we detected colocal-
ized aggregates of HER2 and IL13Rα2 ligands at the TanCAR/
tumor IS, it was unclear whether these aggregates represented 
proximity ranges that correlated to a co-docking of the ligands to 
the CAR T cell. Thus, we pursued super-resolution of the IS to sur-
pass the limit of diffraction and allow a closer look at the proximity 
of the individual ligands to each other at the TanCAR and biCAR 
ISs. STED microscopes that use continuous-wave fiber lasers can 
image with spatial resolution below 60 nm and offer the oppor-
tunity to investigate biological proximity of ligands with superior 
resolution. This allowed us to obtain additional insights into the 
docking of this new generation of CAR molecules.
The Duolink proximity ligation assay (PLA; Duolink, Sigma- 
Aldrich) has been used previously to detect protein-protein 
interactions, but this is its first application, to our knowledge, to 
detect CAR T cells binding to their target. In PLA, when 2 spe-
cific proteins are brought within a range of less than 40 nm of 
each other in the extracellular space, 2 complementary oligo-
nucleotide sequences are able to be ligated and to initiate rolling 
circular DNA replication (Supplemental Figure 3). These areas 
of amplified DNA can be detected fluorescently and quantified. 
We observed significantly more clustering of these PLA signals 
at the immune synapse between interacting TanCAR T cells and 
U373 tumor cells as compared with U373 and biCAR T cells or NT 
T cells. The clustering of IL13Rα2 and HER2 as detected by this 
method strongly suggests that the TanCAR T cells are co-docking 
with IL13Rα2 and HER2 simultaneously on the tumor cell surface. 
We would expect some clustering of these tumor antigens in the 
interactions with biCAR T cells, as heterodimers that may form 
between IL13Rα2 CARs and HER2 CARs could bring the 2 anti-
gens into close enough proximity to be detected by this method. 
We would not expect these 2 antigens to naturally be in close 
proximity except by random chance on the cell surface. These 
hypotheses are consistent with our findings and the comparative 
signals detected per immune synapse.
Despite prolonged antigenic stimulation in a week-long 
assay, TanCAR T cells maintained their phenotype and cytolytic 
stamina. T cell exhaustion is a state of T cell dysfunction and sus-
tained expression of inhibitory receptors (34). TIM3, LAG3, and 
Moreover, while exposure to a single antigen resulted in a decline 
in cytokine release beyond a certain antigen density in unispecific 
and biCAR T cells, TanCAR T cells continued to secrete higher 
levels of cytokines when engaging both antigens. This superaddi-
tive cytokine production points to a reserve functional capacity of 
TanCAR T cells that is recruited upon simultaneous engagement.
Indeed, killing of autologous tumor targets and an enhanced 
cytokine release confirmed the functional superiority of TanCAR 
T cells over unispecific CAR T cells as well as biCAR T cells. A 
scant expression of IL13Rα2 in UPN 3’s tumor was overcome by 
the ability of autologous TanCAR T cells to recognize tumor cells 
expressing HER2, in this case the dominant target antigen, as well 
as HER2/IL13Rα2 coexpressers. Co-docking of TanCARs to both 
targets — an arrangement supported by the in silico model — likely 
played a role in the TanCAR T cells’ enhanced tumor killing. The 
ability to recruit target TAAs to the T cell–GBM interface was evi-
denced by higher-density clustering at the dual TAA IS, resulting 
in stronger T cell activation. The robust dual IS was substantiated 
by our in vivo experiments, in which TanCAR T cells demonstrat-
ed significantly better antitumor activity than their single-speci-
ficity CAR counterparts, as well as CARpool T cells and biCAR T 
cells. Tumors recurring late after TanCAR treatment lacked both 
targeted antigens, indicating that the improved tumor control can 
be explained, at least in part, by mitigating antigen escape. When 
we performed an “efficacy experiment” more in favor of T cells 
(albeit still at 1 T cell to 3 tumor cells), TanCAR T cells were able to 
completely and irreversibly eliminate experimental xenografts in 
all tumor-bearing animals.
The intrinsic enhancement of TanCAR T cell activity could 
also be attributed to their bimodal functionality. Conventional 
CAR T cells recognize only 1 tumor antigen. For instance, when 
IL13Rα2+HER2+ tumors are treated with HER2 CAR T cells, IL13R+ 
tumor cells survive and are positively selected, while only HER2+ 
tumor cells are killed. The TanCAR molecule enables T cells to 
engage single- and double-positive populations, creating a Bool-
ean OR argument. Perhaps an enhanced ability to engage both 
antigens expressed below the recognition threshold of a single 
CAR T cell further contributes to the broader reach of TanCAR T

conceptually this would call for targeting a tumor profile rather 
than a single TAA. Previously, our work has in part answered this 
question in a mathematical model built on data sets from primary 
GBMs that predicts complete tumor elimination. We are currently 
substantiating this finding in a larger cohort of primary GBM (20). 
This profile may include TAAs as well as elements from the tumor 
microenvironment, such as the tumor stroma or tumor-associated 
vasculature. Nevertheless, the current work provides a clear proof 
of principle of the enhanced functionality and effectiveness of 
dual-targeting T cells exerting their effector function by means of 
a single bispecific CAR molecule.
To date, the safety of CAR T cells remains a major concern. On-
target, off-tumor cross-reactivity with normal tissue antigens and 
inadvertent T cell stimulation and expansion remain risks. Tan-
CAR T cells exhibit reactivity against single antigens comparable 
to that of conventional CAR molecules. Interestingly, they exhibit 
conditional superactivation when both antigens are encountered 
simultaneously. It is foreseeable, though, that targeting 2 antigens 
could increase the risk to normal tissues. To mitigate this risk, 
“gated” activation of CAR T cells has been described wherein an 
individual TAA-specific CAR molecule mediated signaling suffi-
cient to elicit cytotoxicity and a second CAR molecule with speci-
ficity to another TAA mediated a costimulatory signal promoting 
full T cell activation (35). In cases where a TAA is shared by normal 
PD-1 are inhibitory surface receptors that contribute to and mark 
a state of T cell exhaustion. Expression of these 3 inhibitory sur-
face molecules was not significantly different between the biCAR 
and TanCAR T cells, suggesting comparable levels of activation 
and susceptibility to these inhibitory surface receptors. The con-
ditional superactivation accompanied by a sustained in vitro anti-
tumor functionality coupled with preservation of a phenotype that 
is not more exhausted than biCAR T cells represents a particularly 
interesting phenomenon in the activation dynamics of TanCAR T 
cells. Collectively, these could explain their enhanced function-
ality compared with unispecific CAR T cells and other bispecific 
products (CARpool and biCAR T cells) in animal experiments and 
perhaps point to potential superiority in the clinic.
Our work concludes that cotargeting both HER2 and IL13Rα2 
results in better tumor control, evidenced by smaller tumor vol-
umes, increased time to tumor progression, and a better ability to 
eliminate established tumors (20). Two long-term follow-up ani-
mal experiments support these findings. Despite increased activa-
tion and killing, some tumors re-emerge when small T cell doses 
are used. These tumors are double-negative, indicating that Tan-
CARs can overcome single antigen escape (19, 20). The delayed 
appearance of double-negative tumor cells, however, poses the 
question of what the threshold number of TAAs is that needs to be 
targeted and past which the tumor is not able to recover. Indeed,

On day 5 after tumor cell injection, mice were treated with an intratumoral injection of 2 × 106 TanCAR T cells (n = 13), biCAR T cells (n = 10), or CARpool T

RaptorX Web server. Docking of the IL-13 mutein model to IL13Rα2 was 
refined using the Docking2 protocol from the Rosetta Online Server. 
Using these data, the whole TanCAR molecule was docked to individual 
targets and the collective data used to model a 3-way docking routine 
where all 3 molecules “sit” together. The final docking was selected 
from among the top 10 candidate dockings that had the best energy 
and lowest root-mean-square deviation when compared with the initial 
docking derived from 3LB6 (Table 1 and ref. 29). A favorable model was 
generated in which the orientation of the TanCAR and target molecules 
was maintained and the intercellular gutter was preserved.
Construction, delivery, and expression of the TanCAR-encoding 
transgene. The IL13Rα2-binding IL-13 mutein was previously described 
(3). The HER2-specific scFv, FRP5, was previously described by Wels 
and colleagues (41). The modeled bispecific extracellular domain was 
assembled on Clone Manager (Sci-Ed Software). The designed trans-
gene DNA sequence was optimized using the GeneOptimizer soft-
ware for maximum protein production (42). The TanCAR extracellular 
domain was then synthesized by GeneArt Inc. using oligonucleotides, 
cloned into the Gateway entry vector pDONR221, and sequence-
verified. This antigen recognition domain was then subcloned in 
frame into an SFG retroviral vector (43) containing a short hinge, the 
transmembrane and signaling domain of the costimulatory molecule, 
CD28, and the ζ signaling domain of the T cell receptor complex. The 
5′–3′ as well as the 3′–5′ sequence of the whole construct was confirmed 
using single-base-pair pyrosequencing (SeqWright DNA Technology) 
with greater than 97% homology with the optimized construct map.
Retrovirus production and transduction of T cells. To produce ret-
roviral supernatant, human embryonic kidney (HEK) 293T cells were 
cotransfected with the TanCAR-encoding retroviral transfer plasmid, 
Peg-Pam-e plasmid encoding MoMLV gag-pol, and plasmid contain-
ing the sequence for RD114 envelope (44), using GeneJuice transfection 
reagent (EMD Biosciences) (44). T cells activated with anti-CD3 (OKT3) 
and anti-CD28 were transduced with retroviral vectors as described (2).
Flow cytometry. Analysis was done with a FACSCalibur instru-
ment (Becton Dickinson), Kaluza software (Beckman Coulter Inc.), 
or FlowJo (FlowJo LLC). Cells were washed with PBS containing 2% 
FBS and 0.1% sodium azide (FACS buffer; Sigma-Aldrich) before 
addition of the antibody. After 30–60 minutes of incubation at 4°C 
in the dark, cells were washed with FACS buffer and fixed in 0.5% 
paraformaldehyde for analysis.
Cell surface expression of FRP5 was detected using goat anti-
mouse Fab fragment specific antibody conjugated with DyLight 
(Jackson ImmunoResearch) or a HER2.Fc chimeric protein followed 
by a FITC-conjugated goat anti-human Fc. IL-13 mutein was detected 
using an IL13Rα2.Fc chimeric protein followed by a goat anti-human 
Fc fragment specific antibody conjugated with FITC (Millipore).
Analysis of cytokine production and T cell expansion. T cells were 
cocultured with autologous GBM or U373 cells. After 24-hour incuba-
tion, conditioned culture media were collected, and levels of IFN-γ 
and IL-2 were determined by ELISA (R&D Systems). To assess T cell 
activation upon encountering of immobilized target TAA, non-tissue-
culture-treated 24-well plates (BD Falcon) were kept overnight at 4°C 
with HER2.Fc (range 0–0.8 μg/ml; R&D Systems), IL13Rα2.Fc (range 
0–10 μg/ml; R&D Systems), an irrelevant target (monoclonal anti-
idiotype 1A7 [ref. 45]; TriGem Titan), and a nonspecific T cell recep-
tor stimulant (OKT3). After T cell incubation for 24 hours at 37°C, the 
supernatant was analyzed for IFN-γ and IL-2.
tissues, a CAR that provides suboptimal activation and a chime-
ric costimulatory receptor that recognizes a second antigen have 
been used to selectively “sense” and destroy tumors that express 
both antigens but do not affect tumors expressing either antigen 
alone (36–38).
Conceptually, mediating enhanced T cell functionality 
by means of a single molecule could have several advantages 
and pragmatic implications in addition to favorable activation 
dynamics (29). The introduction of a single transgene poses 
less risk of insertional mutagenesis, which can destabilize the 
T cell genome with the theoretical yet feared consequence of T 
cell autonomy (39, 40). A single genetic manipulation would be 
more likely to pass the stringent safety requirements of major 
regulatory bodies such as IRBs and the FDA and can thus be 
more readily furthered into the clinic. And while cellular hetero-
geneity is epitomized in GBM, it remains a major hurdle to the 
development of directed and precision therapies for most solid 
malignancies. Indeed, even in the broadly homogeneous B pre-
cursor malignancies, recent reports confirmed the development 
of CD19 escape variants after CD19 CAR T cell therapy (14, 18, 
19). Lastly, our particular choice of antigens, HER2 and IL13Rα2, 
allows for a T cell product that is relevant not only for glioma but 
also for the majority of small-cell and non-small-cell lung can-
cers, colon cancer, and breast cancer.
In summary, targeted T cells are emerging as an effective and 
relatively nontoxic therapy for cancer. Multiple molecules, how-
ever, contribute to the overall antigenic landscape of cancers. 
Hence, targeting a tumor-specific profile rather than a single can-
cer-specific marker could result in better therapeutic efficacy. In 
this work, we show that a single bispecific chimeric antigen recep-
tor molecule can effectively redirect T cells to 2 TAAs and achieve 
markedly enhanced tumor control in GBM.
Methods
Blood donors, primary tumor cells, and cell lines. The U373-GBM cell 
line was purchased from the American Type Culture Collection 
(ATCC). Authentication of the primary line U373 was done as previ-
ously described (2). T cells were maintained in T cell medium (250 
ml RPMI-1640, 200 ml Click’s medium with 10% FCS containing 2 
mmol/l GlutaMAX-I; Invitrogen). Tumor samples were processed 
aseptically, and primary cell cultures were initiated using DMEM with 
15% heat-inactivated FCS, 2 mM GlutaMAX-I.
Immunofluorescent staining. Formalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded 
sections were deparaffinized in xylene and rehydrated in ethanol. 
Antigen retrieval was completed by immersing of slides in 1× DAKO 
citrate buffer under pressure for 45 minutes. Blocking with 0.05% 
Tween in PBS plus 5% donkey serum was done in humidified condi-
tions for 1 hour at room temperature, followed by overnight incuba-
tion at 4°C with primary antibodies, mouse CB11 anti-HER2 in 1:25 
(BioGenex), and goat anti-IL13Rα2 in 1:500 dilution (R&D Systems). 
Slides were incubated for 1 hour at room temperature in secondary 
antibodies diluted at 1:200 (anti-mouse Texas Red and anti-goat Cy5; 
Invitrogen), counterstained with nuclear stain DAPI.
Computational modeling. The structural interrogation was done 
using sequential modeling routines. Initial models for the IL-13 mutein 
and FRP5-scFv domains were generated using Phyre2. In addition, a 
model for the complete TanCAR exodomain was generated using the

were normalized. Impedance-based measurements of the normalized 
cell index were collected every 15 minutes, which are determined by 
measurement of the impedance of current across the transistor plate 
caused by tumor cell adherence.
Orthotopic xenogeneic SCID mouse model of GBM. Recipient NOD-
SCID mice were purchased from Taconic (C.B-Igh-1b/IcrTac-Prkdcscid; 
FOX CHASE CB-17 SCID ICR). Stereotactic tumor establishment of 
eGFP.Firefly luciferase expressing U373 cells was performed as previ-
ously described (2). All animals had progressively growing xenografts, 
evidenced by progressive and exponential increments in biolumines-
cence signal. Each group was randomly assigned a condition of no 
treatment, NT T cells, HER2-specific T cells, IL13Rα2-specific T cells, 
CARpool T cells, biCAR T cells, and TanCAR T cells, and received 
an intratumoral injection of T cells on days 5–8 (the dose and day of 
injection depended on the experiment as described in Results) follow-
ing tumor injection. A “stress test” experiment aiming at simulating 
treatment failure was used to compare single-specificity T cells with 
TanCAR T cells in their ability to offset antigen escape. A separate 
“efficacy experiment” was used to choose which bispecific T cell prod-
uct is more efficacious. Subcutaneous injection of 0.03–0.1 mg/kg 
buprenorphine (Buprenex RBH, England) was given for pain control.
Bioluminescence imaging. Isoflurane-anesthetized animals were 
imaged using the IVIS system (Xenogen Corp.) 10 minutes after i.p. 
injection of 150 mg/kg d-luciferin (Xenogen) as previously described 
(2). Animals were imaged every other day for 1 week after injections, 
twice per week for the next 2 weeks, and weekly thereafter until day 
76. Mice were regularly examined for neurological deficits, weight 
loss, or signs of stress, and euthanized according to preset criteria.
Statistics. Data are presented as mean ± SEM unless otherwise 
indicated in the figure legend. We used Student’s t test for single com-
parisons and Tukey’s single-step test for multiple comparisons. For 
bioluminescence experiments, intensity signals were log-transformed 
and summarized using mean ± SD at baseline and multiple subse-
quent time points for each mouse group. Signal intensity changes 
from baseline at each time point were calculated and compared using 
paired 2-tailed t tests or Wilcoxon signed-ranks test. Log-rank test was 
used to compare the survival distribution between treatment groups. A 
P value less than 0.05 was considered significant.
Study approval. All animal experiments were conducted on pro-
tocol AN3949 approved by the Baylor College of Medicine IACUC. 
Primary tumor cells were obtained from patients with GBM and blood 
samples from GBM patients and healthy donors on protocol H15280 
approved by the IRB of Baylor College of Medicine and Houston 
Methodist Hospital. Written, informed consent was obtained from all 
patients and healthy donors.

Cytotoxicity assays. Cytolytic activity of T cells was assessed using 
51Cr assays as previously described (46). The mean percentage of spe-
cific lysis of triplicate wells was calculated according to the following 
formula: [test release – spontaneous release] / [maximal release – 
spontaneous release] × 100.
Confocal and STED imaging of CAR synapses. For confocal micros-
copy, conjugates between CAR T cells and GBM cells were incubated 
for 45 minutes at 37°C and then fixed and stained for IL13Rα2 and 
HER2. HER2 and IL13Rα2 primary antibodies were subsequently 
detected by anti-mouse 488 and anti-goat 647 Alexa Fluor secondary 
antibodies (Life Technologies), respectively. Conjugates were imaged 
as Z stacks of 0.2 μm thickness to cover the entire volume of the IS, 
determined individually for each conjugate, on a Zeiss Axio-Observer 
Z1 equipped with a Yokogawa CSU10 spinning disc, Zeiss ×63 1.43 NA 
objective, and Hamamatsu Orca-AG camera. Images were acquired 
and analyzed with Volocity software (PerkinElmer). Cluster density of 
receptors at the synapse was calculated using the formula (volume × 
MFI) for an equal number of 1×1×1-μm boxes selected to cover the IS 
(31). All data were graphed using GraphPad Prism software. Statisti-
cal analysis was performed using the Student’s 2-tailed unpaired t test. 
 
P less than 0.05 was considered significant. STED microscopy was 
performed using a Leica TCS SP8 microscope with a ×100 objective.
Proximity ligation assay (Duolink). IL13Rα2 and HER2 antibodies 
were conjugated to (+) and (–) oligonucleotides to create PLA probes 
using the Duolink Probemaker MINUS and PLUS kits, respectively. 
For each experiment, 0.25 × 106 U373 tumor cells plus 0.5 × 106 T cells 
were used. The slides were fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde for 10 
minutes at room temperature and washed in PBS. BSA blocking solu-
tion was applied to each sample and kept at 4°C overnight. The PLA 
was performed according to the manufacturer’s instructions.
Microscopy images of each slide were captured using a Zeiss 
Axioimager spinning disc confocal microscope at ×100 magnification 
detecting light transmission, red fluorescence (wavelength 561 nm), 
and DAPI fluorescence. Images were analyzed using Volocity (Perkin-
Elmer) imaging software. Within conjugates, the area of detection of 
signal was delimited to the area at the IS between the respective T cell 
and U373 cell. The area of the immune synapse was normalized for 
all groups (TanCAR: mean 34.3 μm2, range 27.4–46.79 μm2; biCAR: 
mean 34.69 μm2, range 23.57–43.61 μm2; NT: mean 34.99 μm2, range 
26.32–45.53 μm2). Detection was limited to red fluorescent signals 
with MFI greater than 162 AU and area of at least 0.08 μm2. For 
each condition, at least 20 conjugates were analyzed. Additionally, 
for each condition, background signal was analyzed by selection of 
single U373 tumor cells that were not interacting with any other cells. 
The detection area was delimited to the area near the surface of the 
cell similar in size to the area at the immune synapse as described 
above. Ten U373 cells from each slide were analyzed for this purpose. 
Based on the software readout of MFI and signal area, a calculation 
of MFI × area was made for each signal detected (AU). These were 
added together for each individual synapse to describe the total signal 
detected within 1 IS.
Impedance-based tumor cell killing assay (xCELLigence). Using the 
xCELLigence impedance-based system, continuous tumor cell kill-
ing was evaluated over 150 hours. U373 tumor cells were plated in a 
96-well, resistor-bottomed plate at 10,000 cells per well. After 18–24 
hours, 1,000 effector T cells (1:10 seeding ratio) were added in tripli-
cate, at which point cell index values correlating to U373 adherence
