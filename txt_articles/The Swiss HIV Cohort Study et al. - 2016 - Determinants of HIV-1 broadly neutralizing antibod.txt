bnAbs have become blueprints for vaccine design owing to their 
unequalled activity against divergent HIV-1 strains and proven potency 
in preventing and suppressing HIV-1 infection after in vivo admin-
istration1–8. Elicitation of potent bnAb activity is relatively rare in 
natural HIV-1 infection: only 10–25% of infected individuals develop 
breadth, and an estimated 1% generate highly potent bnAb, or ‘elite 
neutralization’
, activity9,10. Although much is known about the func-
tional properties of bnAbs, the parameters that govern their evolution 
in natural infection remain unknown, which is a critical limitation for 
vaccine development. To date, no vaccine approach has induced bnAb 
responses that match those elicited in natural infection1,11. Defining 
what restricts and promotes bnAb evolution in certain individuals 
will be crucial for devising successful vaccine regimens, as the same 
restrictions are likely to be encountered during immunization.
Observations that bnAb activity arises predominantly in viremic 
individuals after several years of infection and is linked to lower CD4+ 
cell counts (referred to here as CD4 levels)4,12–14 strongly suggest that 
prolonged exposure to viral antigen is needed for induction of bnAbs. 
Broadly neutralizing antibodies (bnAbs) are a focal component of HIV-1 vaccine design, yet basic aspects of their induction remain 
poorly understood. Here we report on viral, host and disease factors that steer bnAb evolution using the results of a systematic 
survey in 4,484 HIV-1-infected individuals that identified 239 bnAb inducers. We show that three parameters that reflect the 
exposure to antigen—viral load, length of untreated infection and viral diversity—independently drive bnAb evolution. Notably, 
black participants showed significantly (P = 0.0086–0.038) higher rates of bnAb induction than white participants. Neutralization 
fingerprint analysis, which was used to delineate plasma specificity, identified strong virus subtype dependencies, with higher 
frequencies of CD4-binding-site bnAbs in infection with subtype B viruses (P = 0.02) and higher frequencies of V2-glycan-specific 
bnAbs in infection with non–subtype B viruses (P = 1 × 10−5). Thus, key host, disease and viral determinants, including subtype-
specific envelope features that determine bnAb specificity, remain to be unraveled and harnessed for bnAb-based vaccine design. 
This may be necessary in part to allow the extensive antibody-affinity 
maturation that is characteristic of many HIV-1-specific bnAbs15,16. 
Similarly, antigen levels may be relevant, as bnAbs have been found 
to evolve less frequently in individuals with lower viral loads1,4,13,17. 
Individual case studies delineating pathways of bnAb maturation have 
highlighted the tight interplay between virus escape and antibody 
adaptation that precedes the development of a broad neutralization 
response18–23. In line with this, the viral envelope diversity gener-
ated by neutralization escape and after superinfection have been 
suggested to foster bnAb evolution4,18,19,24–26. Despite increasing 
evidence showing a link between bnAb evolution and prospective 
factors, including immune parameters4,14,27,28, the individual influ-
ences of these factors remain unclear. The best-established parameters 
across various studies—length of infection, high viral load, low CD4 
level and viral diversity—reflect disease progression and are closely 
linked, leaving uncertain whether they have independent influences 
on bnAb evolution. Factors that are indispensable for bnAb evolution 
or are initial triggers of bnAb induction remain to be determined.

Similarly, which factors restrict bnAb activity to only a fraction of 
individuals and influence evolution of bnAb specificity have not been 
identified. Understanding these determinants will be crucial to pro-
mote the triggering of bnAb responses by immunization and develop 
vaccines that are globally effective in individuals from diverse risk 
groups, ethnicities and HIV-1 subtypes.
RESULTS
Population-wide survey of bnAb activity
To perform a systematic investigation of parameters that steer bnAb 
induction in HIV-1 infection, we analyzed the plasma neutraliza-
tion activity of 4,484 individuals enrolled in the Swiss HIV Cohort 
Study (SHCS), founded in 1988 (ref. 29), or the Zurich Primary HIV 
Infection study (ZPHI), founded in 2002 (ref. 30) (Fig. 1a). These 
long-term, prospective, observational studies maintain extensive 
patient and virus data and biobanks of plasma and blood cell samples 
collected over time, which allowed us to perform a comprehensive 
analysis of viral, host and disease determinants to explore the param-
eters that govern the frequency and type of bnAb induction.
From the total 18,489 individuals in the ZPHI and SHCS cohorts, 
we selected patients with a minimum of 1 year of untreated HIV-1 
infection using a range of criteria (Fig. 1a). To probe the influence of 
long-term antigen exposure, we stratified the cohort according to the 
duration of infection up to the sampling time point, thereby account-
ing for times of virus replication during drug-naive and antiretroviral- 
treatment-interruption periods. Patients were assigned to one of 
three groups: 1 to <3 years of untreated HIV-1 infection (group 1), 
3 to <5 years of untreated HIV-1 infection (group 3) or ≥5 years of 
untreated HIV-1 infection (group 5), with group numbers indicating 
the respective minimums of 1, 3 and 5 years of infection (Fig. 1a  
and Supplementary Table 1). Each individual was represented 
only once, and only plasma samples that showed no nonspecific 
inhibitory effect (as determined by inhibition of murine leukemia 
virus infection (MuLV) in a TZM-bl pseudovirus microneutraliza-
tion assay) were included; this totaled 4,484 plasma samples across 
the three groups. Specific HIV-1 neutralization activity was probed 
against a panel of eight HIV-1 pseudovirus strains from diverse 
subtypes (Supplementary Table 2), which we selected for their 
differential susceptibility to known bnAb types (Supplementary 
Tables 3 and 4). This enabled sensitive detection of the correspond-
ing broadly neutralizing plasma responses (Fig. 1b). We recorded 
the neutralization activity observed for each plasma–virus combi-
nation: neutralization >80% received a score of 3, neutralization of 
50% to <80% received a score of 2, neutralization of 20% to <50% 
received a score of 1, and neutralization <20% received a score of 
0. Plasma samples were then ranked by the sum of scores against 
all eight viruses to reflect their potency and breadth. The maxi-
mum cumulative neutralization score for a given plasma sample was 
24. Scores of ≥15 were categorized as elite neutralization, scores of 
10–14 as broad neutralization, and scores of 5–9 as cross-neutrali-
zation (Table 1). Using these thresholds, 699 individuals (15.6%) 
showed cross-neutralization activity, 181 individuals (4%) showed 
broad neutralization activity, and 58 (1.3%) showed elite neutraliza-
tion activity. We next measured neutralization activity of the 105 
plasmas with the highest neutralization activity (score ≥13) in an 
extended 40-virus multiclade panel (Fig. 2a and Supplementary 
Tables 2 and 5). Results from this 40-virus screen confirmed the 
validity of the 8-virus screening panel and the scoring system in 
identifying individuals with broad (Fig. 2b) and potent (Fig. 2c) 
neutralizing activity.
Defining determinants of bnAb development
With these large numbers of cross-, broad and elite neutralizers 
identified and the extensive patient and disease data available in 
our cohorts, we had a unique opportunity to conduct a systematic 
analysis of factors that drive bnAb evolution. We focused our analysis 
on seven parameters, for which we had complete data sets for 4,079 
individuals (Fig. 3a): five viral or disease parameters (viral load and 
CD4 level at the time of sampling, duration of untreated infection, 
HIV-1 pol subtype and mode of transmission) and two patient-related

parameters (ethnicity and sex). Each parameter was assessed for its 
individual association with bnAb induction using univariable and 
multivariable multinomial logistic regression models controlling 
for the remaining parameters (Supplementary Table 6). We fur-
ther verified our findings using linear and Tobit regression models 
 
(Supplementary Tables 7–11).
We first explored the impact of viral load and CD4 level on bnAb 
emergence, two inversely linked parameters that are closely associated 
with disease progression31. Higher viral loads proved to be an inde-
pendent driver of neutralization breadth (Fig. 3b, Supplementary 
Fig. 1a,b and Supplementary Table 6), confirming a need for certain 
levels of antigen exposure. The effect of CD4 levels on broad and 
elite neutralization was not statistically significant (P > 0.05) in our 
model. Lower CD4 levels were, however, associated with a modest 
increase in cross-neutralizing activity that was independent of viral 
load and the other parameters (Fig. 3c, Supplementary Fig. 1c,d 
and Supplementary Table 6). Notably, this negative effect of CD4 
levels was particularly strong in samples of patients with more than 
 
500 CD4+ cells/µl at the sampling time point (Supplementary Table 8). 
 
If there is indeed a direct impact from CD4+ T cell loss on bnAb devel-
opment, this could indicate a decrease in negative regulators of bnAb 
development, potentially caused by enabling survival of auto-reactive 
B cells or limiting effects of polyactivation of B cells12,32,33.
As observed previously, the frequency of bnAb inducers strongly 
increased with infection length, with notably lower activity in group 
1 than in groups 3 and 5 (Fig. 3d and Supplementary Fig. 1e,f). 
However, we found—for the first time, to our knowledge—that the 
duration of infection was an independent driver of bnAb induction, 
with exceptionally high association (odds ratio >3 for each neutrali-
zation category; Fig. 3e). Notably, we found no significant difference 
between groups 3 and 5 (P = 0.54, likelihood ratio test), indicating that 
the probability for a broad neutralization response does not increase 
further after several (≥3) years of infection in our cohort.
Another parameter closely linked with virus exposure is the genetic 
diversity of the virus, which is known to increase during the course 
of the infection34,35. We had access to viral-diversity data, based on 
a method that uses ambiguous nucleotide calls from pol sequences 
derived during routine genotypic resistance testing (GRT) for antiret-
roviral treatment (ART) optimization34, for 3,306 individuals enrolled 
in our study. Using pol gene data provides an independent measure of 
diversity that, unlike env diversity, is not directly influenced by bnAb 
activity. When adding these GRT-derived data to our multivariate 
analysis to probe the influence of diversity on bnAb frequencies, we 
also controlled for the time points of testing, as these varied among

individuals. The odds ratios we obtained confirmed that increasing 
 
diversity is a third independent factor associated with antigen 
exposure that influences the development of breadth (Fig. 3f,g, 
Supplementary Fig. 1g,h and Supplementary Table 6). A signifi-
cant and strong effect of diversity persisted even after adjusting for 
the time of both the diversity estimate and the neutralization screen 
(Fig. 3g), indicating that the impact of diversity was independent of 
the duration of infection and the time point of GRT. This influence 
of diversity supports the observation of cases with bnAb evolution 
after superinfection19,24 and underscores the potential of genetically 
diverse prime–boost vaccine regimens.
The SHCS and ZPHI cohorts reflect the HIV-1 epidemic in 
Switzerland, which is dominated by subtype B infection in white individ-
uals (Fig. 4a–c). Non–subtype B infections represented 24% of the 4,484 
study participants. Subtypes A, circulating recombinant form (CRF) 
02_AG, subtype C and CRF01_AE, as determined from pol sequence 
data, were the largest groups outside subtype B and were more frequent 
among nonwhite participants (Fig. 4a–c). We thus probed the influence 
of virus subtype and ethnicity on the frequency of bnAb induction. We 
observed no statistical difference in the frequency of broad neutraliza-
tion development between subtype B with non–subtype B infections 
(Fig. 4d,e) or between individual non-B subtypes (Supplementary 
Table 9). Notably, however, black ethnicity consistently showed a strong 
and independent effect on bnAb induction, as compared to white eth-
nicity (Fig. 4f,g and Supplementary Table 9). Differences in the studied 
ethnic groups may be due to a range of factors. For example, infec-
tion characteristics in our cohort differed among ethnicities: nonwhite 
participants acquired HIV-1 more frequently outside of Switzerland, 
their infection was detected later and they showed higher frequencies of 
females and heterosexual transmissions36,37 (Supplementary Table 12). 
Controlling for confounding parameters, our analysis confirmed, how-
ever, that black ethnicity is associated with higher bnAb frequencies 
independently of influences from all other probed variables, including 
the duration of infection (Supplementary Table 11). This association 
with black ethnicity merits further exploration, but definition of factors 
that generally influence bnAb induction and which are more frequently 
represented among black individuals and how they are represented in 
other ethnicities will require additional studies specifically tailored 
to address differences among ethnicities. In principle, many factors, 
including the geographical and socioeconomic setting of HIV-1 acqui-
sition and host genomics, may affect infection and thereby influence 
immune responses. Consequently, a range of additional factors (for 
example, coinfection with other sexually transmitted diseases at the 
time of HIV-1 acquisition) that are not systematically recorded for the 
majority of infected individuals need to be considered, as they may have 
roles in stimulating antibody responses. The black individuals in our 
cohort have highly diverse backgrounds, including Sub-Saharan Africa, 
Northern Africa, North America or the Caribbean, and most of them 
acquired HIV-1 infection abroad37 (Supplementary Table 13). A higher 
propensity to mount neutralization breadth was observed across black 
participants (Supplementary Fig. 2) and did not depend on whether 
infection dates were confirmed or estimated (Supplementary Table 10). 
Although this may suggest that geographical or socioeconomic factors 
at time of infection (for example, access to health care) are not the main 
drivers of the observed differences between black and white individuals 
in this cohort, our study was not tailored to address these parameters, 
thus we cannot rule out a contribution from such influences. Of par-
ticular note, a recent vaccine trial observed higher neutralization titers

among African Americans than whites in response to a gp120 vaccine38, 
indicating the existence of ethnicity-dependent variations among 
 
drivers of antibody induction.
Notably, in our cohort, ethnicity was, after duration of infection, 
the strongest driver of neutralization breadth (Fig. 4h). An analysis of 
the remaining parameters considered in our study (sex and mode of 
transmission) revealed no additional, consistent influences on bnAb 
evolution (Fig. 4h and Supplementary Table 6).
Virus subtype influences prevalence of bnAb types
We next asked whether there are specific factors that guide the 
epitope specificity of bnAbs. Delineation of bnAb specificity in poly-
clonal plasma is complex, and both mathematical prediction, based 
on bnAb neutralization fingerprint analysis, and mapping with 
mutant virus devoid of known bnAb epitopes are often only par-
tially successful in defining specificities14,24,39,40. We relied here on 
a comparison of prediction methods to deconvolute the dominant 
neutralization specificity of the 105 top neutralizing plasmas ana-
lyzed for neutralization activity against the 40-virus multiclade panel 
(Fig. 2 and Supplementary Table 5). To delineate specificities, we 
used neutralization fingerprints of known bnAbs covering the major 
 
neutralization-sensitive sites on the viral envelope against the same 
40-virus panel (Supplementary Table 4). Focusing solely on the 
bnAbs that neutralize >50% of the probed viruses, we established 
a strategy, termed maximal-Spearman-based prediction (MSBP), to 
define specificities in plasmas that match a known bnAb type. The 
prediction yielded a dominant bnAb type for 82 of the 105 plasmas 
(Fig. 5a,b, Supplementary Fig. 3 and Supplementary Data Set 1). We 
verified the MSBP-based specificity prediction in a sensitivity analysis 
using three alternative methods, including a delineation algorithm 
developed recently by Georgiev et al.40 (Supplementary Figs. 4 and 5 
and Supplementary Data Sets 2 and 3). All four prediction methods 
yielded highly similar results in predicting CD4 binding site (CD4bs) 
and V2-glycan-like responses but differed in dissection of V3-gly-
can and membrane-proximal external region (MPER) specificities, 
suggesting that these predictions are less accurate (Supplementary 
Figs. 4a–c and 5a–c). To further verify the validity of the computa-
tional epitope delineation, we confirmed that plasma samples pre-
dicted to contain V2-glycan specificities lost neutralization activity in 
response to the same V2-mutant viruses as known V2-glycan bnAbs 
(Supplementary Fig. 6 and Supplementary Data Set 4).
We next investigated whether the infecting subtype has an influence 
on the type of bnAb response elicited. When we compared the bnAb spe-
cificities of plasmas originating from subtype B and non-B infections,

we found that the distribution of bnAb specificities differed signifi-
cantly across all prediction methods (Fig. 5c and Supplementary 
Figs. 4d and 5d). Plasmas with V2-glycan-specific antibodies were 
dominated by non–subtype B infection (P = 1 × 10−5 with MSBP; 
P = 8 × 10−6 to 1 × 10−3 with other methods). Conversely, CD4bs-
specific bnAbs were more prevalent in subtype B infection (P = 0.02 
with MSBP; P = 8 × 10−4 to 0.04 with other methods; Fig. 5c and 
Supplementary Figs. 4d and 5d). In contrast, there was no consist-
ent significant difference between subtype B and non-B infections in 
inducing V3-glycan and MPER responses. Owing to the lower reso-
lution in defining these two specificities (Supplementary Figs. 4b,c 
and 5b,c), however, this result must be interpreted with caution. The 
underrepresentation of V2-glycan responses in subtype B infection 
was notable, especially when considering that the 8-virus panel con-
tained several strains highly sensitive to known V2-glycan bnAbs 
(Supplementary Table 4). Suggesting an unfavorable presentation 
of the V2-glycan epitope in subtype B viruses, this finding may also 
explain why potent V2-glycan bnAbs have thus far been identified only 
in non-B infection (Supplementary Table 3). Notably, the infecting 
subtype steered both CD4bs and V2-glycan responses independently 
of ethnicity (Fig. 5d,e and Supplementary Table 14). By contrast, 
ethnicity had no significant effect on the type of antibody response in 
the multivariable model. Although influences of viral subtype on the 
frequency of bnAb elicitation may be subtle and our study may have 
lacked the power to identify these, the viral subtype proved a driver 
of the type of antibody response that is evoked.
DISCUSSION
Our cohorts contain a large number of individuals with detailed 
demographic and disease parameters. Through this population-
wide survey we were able to put the increasing number of parameters 
considered to be drivers of neutralization breadth into perspective, 
explore their interdependencies and identify novel parameters. 
 
We found that a range of factors, including some that have been 
suggested before, independently promote the evolution of broad 
neutralization responses, and this result offers exciting opportuni-
ties for vaccine design. Antigen load, duration of viral exposure and 
viral diversity link bnAb evolution to extended antigen experience. 
 
They can, therefore, be exploited individually in promoting bnAb 
induction in vaccine regimens. Years of antigen contact that favor

bnAb evolution in natural infection cannot be replicated by vaccina-
tion. Our findings lend support to the idea that prolonged antigen 
exposure, although an influential driver of bnAb evolution, may be 
dispensable if other factors that promote bnAb elicitation are pro-
vided. This is also supported by individual case reports, including 
cases of mother-to-child transmission in which bnAb activity develops 
 
early after infection41, suggesting that effective elicitation of bnAbs 
by vaccination should, in principle, be possible.
The pronounced influence of ethnicity on frequency of bnAb 
induction is intriguing and raises the possibility that specific factors 
drive bnAb evolution. Definition of these variables and their preva-
lence across ethnicities will be key and will help to determine whether 
any might open new roads for stimulation of bnAb responses. It is 
important to note that our study does not have the means to dissect 
host genetics or socioeconomic or geographical parameters that may 
drive the influence of ethnicity on bnAb evolution. Determining the 
precise links between ethnicity and likelihood of developing bnAbs 
will require extensive study of bnAb inducers from diverse ethnici-
ties and may specifically require large-scale surveys across black 
 
individuals with different genetic and geographical backgrounds.
Multispecificity of neutralizing antibody responses is considered 
crucial for sustained vaccine efficacy across HIV-1 subtypes and 
requires detailed knowledge about how to elicit individual bnAb 
responses. Here we show for V2-glycan and CD4bs bnAbs that the 
type of bnAb induced strongly depends on the subtype of the infecting 
 
virus. This result suggests that the viral envelope proteins harbor 
subtype specific conformational traits that favor the evolution of one 
specificity over another. To date, the structural information on native 
HIV-1 envelope trimer conformation is limited to a few selected 
strains42. Broader comparisons of envelope structures across viral 
subtypes are therefore necessary to identify the determinants of the 
preferential induction of V2-glycan, CD4bs and possibly other bnAb 
specificities to exploit them for immunogen design. The identification 
of these determinants of bnAb specificity, together with the definition 
of potential disease, socioeconomic, geographical and host genomic 
factors involved in bnAb evolution as well as parameters that replicate 
important features of HIV-1 antigen exposure in immunization will 
open new avenues for rational HIV-1 vaccine design.

ONLINE METHODS
Study populations and ethics information. The 4,484 patient plasma samples 
(4,515 including those later excluded for non-HIV-1-specific inhibitory activity 
 
in plasma; 3,078 male, 1,406 female; see Supplementary Table 1) analyzed 
in the current study were derived from samples stored in the biobanks of 
the Swiss HIV Cohort study (SHCS) and the Zurich Primary HIV Infection 
Study (ZPHI). The SHCS is a prospective, nationwide, longitudinal, nonin-
terventional, observational, clinic-based cohort with semiannual visits and 
blood collections, enrolling all HIV-infected adults living in Switzerland29. 
The SHCS, founded in 1988, is highly representative of the HIV epidemiology 
 
in Switzerland, as it includes an estimated 53% of all HIV cases diagnosed 
in Switzerland since the onset of the epidemic, 72% of all patients receiving 
ART in Switzerland, and 69% of the nationwide registered AIDS cases29,43. 
The SHCS data are collected by the five Swiss university hospitals, two can-
tonal hospitals, 15 affiliated hospitals and 36 private physicians (listed in 
 
http://www.shcs.ch/180-health-care-providers). The SHCS is registered under 
the Swiss National Science longitudinal platform (http://www.snf.ch/en/funding/ 
programmes/longitudinal-studies/Pages/default.aspx#Currently%20supporte
d%20longitudinal%20studies). Detailed information on the study is available 
at http://www.shcs.ch.
The ZPHI is an ongoing, observational, nonrandomized, single center cohort 
founded in 2002 that specifically enrolls patients with documented acute or recent 
primary HIV-1 infection (ClinicalTrials.gov identifier NCT00537966)30.
The SHCS and the ZPHI were approved by the ethics committees of the par-
ticipating institutions (Kantonale Ethikkommission Bern, Ethikkommission des 
Kantons St. Gallen, Comite Departemental d’Ethique des Specialites Medicales et 
de Medicine Communataire et de Premier Recours, Kantonale Ethikkommission 
Zürich, Repubblica et Cantone Ticino–Comitato Ethico Cantonale, Commission 
Cantonale d’Étique de la Recherche sur l’Être Humain, Ethikkommission beider 
Basel for the SHCS and Kantonale Ethikkommission Zürich for the ZPHI), and 
written informed consent was obtained from all participants. Further details on 
cohorts are provided in the Supplementary Note.
Patient data. Both SHCS and ZPHI maintain comprehensive, longitudinal, 
anonymous data collections for all participants, including extensive clinical and 
demographic data. The following parameters were used in the current study: 
longitudinal viral load and CD4+ cell measurements, clinical history (antiret-
roviral drug history, infection length, patient demographics) and nucleotide 
sequence data from genotypic antiretroviral drug resistance tests (GRT). See the 
Supplementary Note for details on how these parameters were recorded.
Time of HIV acquisition. The time of HIV acquisition was determined on the 
basis of the available data.
ZPHI. The time of HIV acquisition was determined for each individual 
enrolled in the ZPHI through consideration of clinical and laboratory data 
such as known risk situations, appearance of first symptoms, earlier negative 
test results, avidity assays and western blot results (negative, indeterminate and 
seroconversion date) as described elsewhere44.
SHCS. For the SHCS we used a hierarchical approach to estimate the infection 
date on the basis of indicators of varying reliability. The following methods were 
used with decreasing priority to yield the maximal accuracy for infection dates 
possible with the available data:
1.  
Defined primary infection: for 1,008 of the 4,484 patients, either seroconver-
sion dates (negative and positive HIV screening test less than 1 year apart) 
or a diagnosis of a primary infection were available. We used the midpoint 
between the dates of the negative and positive tests or, if known, the date of 
the primary infection as the estimated infection date for these individuals.
2.  
Defined recent infection: an additional 544 patients had a treatment-
naive genotypic resistance test within the first year after diagnosis with 
low diversity (less than 0.5% of ambiguous nucleotides) and CD4+ cell 
counts above 200 at registration; on the basis of existing data in the 
 
literature34,45,46, we interpreted these as recent infections and used the 
diagnosis date as an estimate for the infection date.
3.  
For an additional 2,803 patients, we used infection-date estimates based 
on a back-calculation method47 using CD4+ cell counts and their slopes 
when available.
4.  
For the remaining 129 patients, no accurate dating was available. For these 
individuals the date of diagnosis was used as substitute for the infection date, 
which allowed us to define at least a minimal infection length. These 129 pa-
tients were assigned to group 1 (N = 37), group 3 (N = 38) or group 5 (N = 54). 
As the estimated infection date for these 129 individuals is a minimum 
estimate, the classification of individuals assigned to group 5 is accurate. 
Knowledge of an earlier infection date would not change their classification, 
group 5 already has the longest infection duration. We nevertheless veri-
fied that data from these 129 individuals did not influence our observations. 
The P values reported in Supplementary Table 6 changed only marginally 
when the 129 individuals were excluded from the analysis. No additional 
significant observations were altered by inclusion or exclusion of this group 
(data not shown). We therefore opted to include these individuals in the 
final analysis. To exclude confounding influences from differential precision 
in the time of HIV acquisition on our data analysis, we verified that param-
eters identified in the complete cohort (Figs. 3 and 4) were detected in indi-
viduals with defined primary or recent infection (N = 1,552, corresponding 
to categories 1 and 2 above; data on all parameters were available for testing 
for 1,476) and those for whom the infection time point was less precise and 
had to be estimated by the various strategies listed above (N = 2,932, cor-
responding to categories 3 and 4 above; for 2,603 of whom all parameters 
were available for testing) (Supplementary Table 10).
Defining duration of HIV-1 exposure. The duration of HIV-1 exposure 
 
(net virus replication) was defined for each individual by accounting for 
 
all periods with untreated HIV-1 infection from the estimated time of HIV 
acquisition onward. For this, treatment regimens and treatment interruptions 
were evaluated for all included individuals, and a cumulative time off ART 
 
was calculated for each patient. Time periods covering the observation peri-
ods within the cohorts reflect exact accounts of time. Time periods before 
 
entry into the studies are approximate values based on the estimated dates of 
HIV acquisition (see above).
In a sensitivity analysis, we restricted the population to patients with at least 
 
3 years of untreated infection (Supplementary Table 11). On the basis of our find-
ing that infection time has no significant effect after 3 years of infection (Fig. 3), 
this restriction indicates the impact of other parameters while largely excluding 
the impact and potential confounding of infection time. To be conservative, this 
restriction was based on infection time calculated with the time of diagnosis 
instead of the estimated date of infection as a starting point. This thereby ensures 
that all included patients have experienced at least 3 years of untreated infection 
(independently of the estimation method used for the date of infection).
Patient selection, samples size and stratification. Individuals included in our 
screen had to meet several predefined criteria that were installed for the purpose 
of the current analysis and planned follow-up studies. We made no sample size 
restriction; all available samples that fulfilled the criteria were included.
1.  
Time of HIV-1 acquisition had to be known or predictable to define the 
length of untreated HIV-1 infection (see Supplementary Note).
2.  
The patients had to have experienced a minimum of 1 year of untreated 
HIV-1 infection.
3.  
Plasma samples off ART (for the neutralization studies conducted in 
 
the current study) and PBMCs (to allow isolation of bnAbs in follow-up 
studies) had to be available. If the sample was taken during a treatment 
interruption, we required that the sampling time was at least 90 d after 
the start of the interruption (to avoid residual effects of ART).
4.  
Because a main interest of our study was to define parameters of bnAb 
induction that may also be relevant during vaccination and thus in healthy 
immune systems, we restricted our analysis to patients at disease stages 
 
before AIDS, selecting only plasma samples before a stage C event, as defined 
 
by the 1993 revised classification of the Centers for Disease Control and 
Prevention48, and from time points with CD4 levels above 200 cells/µl.
5.  
The selected plasma sample had to have a detectable viral load. Although 
this potentially excludes elite controllers, the measure limits chances 
 
of residual ART being present and will allow virus envelope cloning 
 
from the same time point at which bnAb activity was identified in 
 
follow-up studies.

6.  
Plasma had to be free of unspecific inhibitory activity as determined by 
inhibition of MuLV envelope pseudotyped virus.
Stratification. Broad neutralizing responses have been shown to preferen-
tially develop after extended periods of virus replication and may even decline 
 
at later time points23. To obtain a global picture of bnAb frequency in HIV 
infection and address the timing aspects, we selected individuals and assigned 
them into one of three groups according to the length of HIV-1 exposure. Each 
individual was represented only once.
Group 1 (≥1 year < 3 years HIV-1 exposure). Individuals who were 
 
documented with untreated HIV infection (detectable viral load, off ART) for 
 
a minimum of 1 and a maximum of 3 years of infection. If multiple samples 
 
from one patient were available and fell into group 1, the sample taken closest 
to the 2-year time point was chosen.
Group 3 (≥3 years < 5 years HIV-1 exposure). If multiple samples from one 
patient were available and fell into group 3, the sample taken closest to the 4-year 
time point was chosen.
Group 5 (≥5 years HIV-1 exposure). If multiple samples from one patient 
were available and fell into group 5, the sample taken closest to the 5-year time 
point was chosen.
Blinding. Personnel who conducted the neutralization screen had no informa-
tion on patient demographics at the time of analysis.
Reagents. Properties of monoclonal antibodies used in this study are listed in 
Supplementary Table 3.
Cells. 293T cells were obtained from the American Type Culture Collection 
(ATCC) and TZM-bl reporter cells49 through the NIH ARP. Both cell lines were 
cultured in DMEM containing 10% FCS and antibiotics and regularly checked 
for the absence of mycoplasma.
Virus screening panels. Properties and sources of plasmids encoding the enve-
lope genes of all HIV-1 strains included in the screening panels are listed in 
Supplementary Table 2. We selected viruses of the primary 8-virus screening 
and secondary 40-virus screening virus panels (Supplementary Table 2) on the 
basis of published bnAb neutralization data (CATNAP)50 and additional bnAb 
neutralization studies (Supplementary Table 4). In both virus panels we sought 
to include strains from different subtypes that allow both a sensitive detection 
of bnAb activity and a basic dissection of main bnAb categories based on neu-
tralization fingerprint analysis. For the production of Env pseudovirus stocks, 
293T cells were transfected with the luciferase reporter HIV-1 pseudotype vector 
pNLlucAM and env expression plasmids as described51.
V2 envelope point mutations used to probe V2-glycan bnAb specificity 
(C1080.c3 N160D, CNE5 N160D, WITO K168E; Supplementary Fig. 6) were 
generated by site-directed mutagenesis (Agilent QuikChange II XL) according 
to the manufacturer’s instructions. All point mutated envelopes were sequenced 
in house by Sanger sequencing to confirm presence of the desired mutations and 
absence of unintended sequence changes.
Primary neutralization screen. In the primary 8-virus neutralization screen, 
neutralization capacity of patient plasma against a panel of eight divergent 
HIV-1 strains was assessed in a 384-well Env pseudovirus luciferase reporter 
assay on TZM-bl cells. Briefly, a 1/150 dilution of heat-inactivated plasma was 
preincubated with the respective virus for 1 h before infection of target cells. 
Neutralization activity was calculated as the reduction in infectivity (measured 
as relative light units luminescence evoked by the luciferase reporter) compared 
to infection in absence of plasma. Samples with confirmed activity against MuLV 
Env pseudovirus above 20% were excluded.
Scoring neutralization activity using the primary screen. To evaluate breadth 
and potency, we used a scoring of the neutralization activity measured in the 
8-virus screen. Neutralization activity of plasma against a specific virus received 
a score of 0 when neutralization activity was below 20%, a score of 1 when 
 
neutralization activity ranged between 20% and <50%, a score of 2 for neutraliza-
tion between 50% and <80% and a score of 3 for neutralization ≥80%. Plasmas 
were then ranked by the sum of scores against all eight viruses to reflect their 
potency and breadth (Fig. 1b,c). The maximum cumulative neutralization score 
a plasma could reach was 24.
40-virus multiclade neutralization screen. The top-scoring bnAb contain-
ing plasmas (scores ≥13, N = 105; Supplementary Table 5) in the primary 
8-virus screen were subjected to a more in-depth characterization of neu-
tralization potency and breadth using a panel of 40 genetically diverse Env 
 
pseudoviruses representing important subtypes and circulating recombinant 
forms (Supplementary Table 2). Serial dilutions of plasma samples starting 
at dilution 1/100 were assessed for neutralization activity and the reciprocal, 
half-maximum neutralization titer (NT50) for each plasma virus combination 
defined. On the basis of these neutralization data, a final ranking of the top 
105 bnAb plasma samples was performed according to the geometric mean 
 
NT50 value of each plasma across all 40 viruses. For the calculation of this over-
all geometric mean, a value of 100 (the lowest dilution tested) was used for 
all plasma samples that did not reach a NT50 at this concentration. To reflect 
potency of the plasmas we additionally determined the geometric mean NT50 
across all neutralized strains (Fig. 2 and Supplementary Table 5).
Definition of cross-, broad and elite neutralization activity. In recent years a 
consensus in the field has been reached that approximately 10–25% of individu-
als develop neutralization breadth17 and an estimated 1% of individuals generate 
highly potent bnAb activity, termed elite neutralization activity10,12,13,17,18,41,52–57. 
Yet, thus far no standardized classification methods have been installed to 
allow a unified definition of what precisely constitutes a broad or elite response. 
Moreover, as virus panels used for definition of breadth differ in size and 
 
composition, direct comparisons between studies remain difficult.
For this study, we needed a simple ranking system based on the 8-virus screen 
that allowed us to compare neutralization activity with low, medium and high 
breadth and potency to define parameters that influence development of high 
and low neutralization breadth. To this end we ranked the neutralization activi-
ties by setting threshold scores that best reflect the frequencies of expected elite 
and broad activity described in the literature10,12,13,17,18,41,52–57 and classified 
plasma with scores of 15 and higher as elite neutralization, scores of 10–14 as 
broad neutralization, scores of 5–9 as cross-neutralization and scores below 5 
as no or weak neutralization activity. These thresholds provided a simple grad-
ing system: to be ranked as a cross-neutralizer, a plasma had to exhibit activity 
against at least two of the eight panel viruses (for example, one virus neutralized 
with >80% and one with >50%; or more viruses with weaker potency); to be clas-
sified as broad it had to exhibit activity against at least four of the panel viruses 
(for example, three viruses with >80% and one with >20%); to be classified as 
elite it had to exhibit potent activity against at least five of the panel viruses (for 
example, five viruses with >80%). This scoring system proved valid in identifying 
high neutralization breadth, as highlighted by activity of the top neutralizing 
plasmas (scores ≥13; N = 105) in the 40-virus multiclade panel.
Prediction of bnAb epitope specificity in plasma. Neutralization patterns of 
bnAbs with defined epitopes against diverse virus panels can be used to establish 
neutralization fingerprints and delineate the epitope specificities in polyclonal 
plasma responses39,40. To derive information on the type of bnAb specificity 
evoked by the top 105 bnAb inducers, we used the 40-virus multiclade panel to 
establish neutralization fingerprints of bnAbs with known epitope specificities 
and the top 105 plasmas (Supplementary Tables 4 and 5). Only bnAbs that 
neutralized (IC50 < 50 µg/ml) at least 50% of the panel viruses were included 
(Supplementary Table 4), and these were grouped by the HIV-1 Env epitope 
they target: V2 glycans (PG9, PG16, PGDM1400, PGT145), V3 glycans (PGT121, 
PGT128, PGT130), CD4bs (VRC01, PGV04), interface (PGT151) and MPER 
(2F5, 4E10, 10E8). From these data, delineation of plasma antibody specificities 
can be achieved by a variety of strategies. We chose a comparison of four differ-
ent methods for the prediction of bnAb specificities and included a sensitivity 
analysis to verify the predictions (Fig. 5 and Supplementary Figs. 3–5).
To delineate the bnAb specificity of plasma antibodies in the maximal-
Spearman-based prediction (MSBP) method (Fig. 5 and Supplementary 
 
Figs. 3–5), a plasma was assigned to the bnAb with the most similar neutraliza-
tion fingerprint, where similarity was measured using the Spearman correlation

 nature medicine
doi:10.1038/nm.4187
of the IC50 values of the bnAbs and the inverse NT50 values of the plasmas. 
If the fingerprint similarity with none of the included bnAbs was greater 
than 0.4 (a common threshold for moderate–strong correlation)58 then no 
 
prediction was made.
To probe the validity of the predictions made with MSBP, we used three alter-
native methods (Supplementary Figs. 4 and 5).
1.  
The maximal-Pearson-based prediction (MPBP) follows the principle of 
MSBP with the exception that the Pearson correlation of the log(IC50) 
values of the bnAbs and the inverse log(NT50) values of the plasmas were 
used instead of the Spearman correlation coefficient.
2.  
A recent method developed by Georgiev et al.40 utilizes the rank-order of 
neutralization potencies of plasmas and reference antibodies to deline-
ate plasma antibody specificities. We employed this analysis essentially 
as described40 and termed it delineation analysis Georgiev (DAG) in our 
comparative analysis. As our panel contained only a few bnAbs per class, 
we considered a version of the DAG algorithm where each bnAb was 
 
allowed to form its own cluster.
3.  
For a hierarchical clustering-based prediction (HCBP), we used a Spear-
man correlation matrix of all neutralization values (Supplementary Fig. 3) 
 
for plasmas and bnAbs as an input from which a UPGMA (unweighted 
pair group method with arithmetic mean) tree was derived. The UPGMA 
 
tree was computed on the basis of the Euclidean distance measure 
 
applied to the correlation matrix with the restriction of keeping plasmas 
and bnAbs separate. The subtree for plasmas was then cut into a pre-
defined number (7) of clusters. These clusters correspond to groups of 
plasmas with similar correlation patterns to other plasmas and known 
bnAbs. As HCBP per se does not link a cluster to a specific bnAb type, 
we refer for interpretation purposes to that cluster with the largest 
 
overlap with MSBP-predicted CD4bs plasmas (overlap measured by 
 
adjusted Rand index) as CD4bs clusters and accordingly for the 
 
remaining bnAb specificities.
To assess the robustness of the defined bnAb type clusters in the four meth-
ods we performed two separate analyses (Supplementary Figs. 4a and 5a). 
In the first (Supplementary Fig. 4a), MSBP was set as reference, and thus we 
restricted the comparison to those 82 plasma samples for which MSBP could 
make a prediction. In the second robustness analysis (Supplementary Fig. 5a), 
 
MSBP was performed without a cutoff so that all 105 plasma samples 
 
were linked with the bnAb type for which they had the highest association, 
irrespective of the strength of correlation. Although this setting also assigns 
a bnAb specificity for very weak correlations and should thus not be used for 
 
a final specificity prediction, it enables a sensitivity analysis across all 105 plasma 
 
samples with all four prediction methods and to assess the impact of the cut-
off in the MSBP method. For both settings, cluster robustness was evaluated 
 
using the adjusted and unadjusted Rand index (Supplementary Figs. 4b,c 
and 5b,c). Both analyses (with and without restriction in MSBP) showed that 
V2-glycan- and CD4bs-specific antibodies were robustly predicted, whereas 
predictions for V3- and MPER-specific antibodies varied to a greater extent 
between the methods.
In a further sensitivity analysis, we probed the agreement of the four predic-
tion methods by investigating the influence of the infecting subtype on the type 
of bnAb (Supplementary Figs. 4d and 5d). Using Fisher’s exact test, we found 
that for both analyses, with and without restriction in MSBP, all four prediction 
methods showed a similar impact of viral subtype on bnAb type, thus highlight-
ing that the findings do not depend on the prediction method.
Confirmation of predicted V2-glycan cluster plasma using V2 mutant 
viruses. Neutralization of bnAbs and the top 105 plasma samples was assessed 
against three pairs of wild-type and V2 mutant viruses (C1080c3/C1080.c3 
N160D, CNE5/CNE5 N160D and WITO/WITO K168E) that are known to affect 
efficacy of V2-glycan bnAbs Pg9, Pg16 or PGT145 (Supplementary Fig. 6). 
 
Neutralization assays with Env pseudoviruses were performed using the TZM-bl 
assay as described above, and Wilcoxon signed-rank tests were used to compare 
the differences between the log10(NT50) values of wild-type and mutant virus 
for each bnAb specificity.
Statistical analysis. Statistical analyses were performed in STATA (version 14) 
 
and in R (version 3.1.1). Odds ratios were computed using univariable and 
multivariable multinomial logistic regression with breadth of neutraliza-
tion response as the outcome variable (categories: no neutralization (base-
line), cross-neutralization, broad neutralization, and elite neutralization) in 
 
Figures 3 and 4 and Supplementary Table 6. In these analyses, viral load and 
CD4 level at time of sampling were included as continuous variables; duration of 
untreated infection, HIV-1 subtype, mode of transmission, ethnicity, and sex as 
categorical variables. These seven parameters were included and controlled for in 
all multivariate analyses listed in Figures 3 and 4 and in Supplementary Table 6. 
In Figure 3f,g and Supplementary Table 6, diversity was included as an addi-
tional parameter. The regression analyses performed and referred to in the text 
and figures are summarized in Supplementary Figure 2 and Supplementary 
Tables 6 and 14.
Supplementary Table 6 also contains additional regression analyses 
 
performed to control for potential influences of diversity on the findings. 
 
In the analysis for the effect of diversity the fraction of ambiguous nucleotides 
was added as a continuous covariable (see above).
To verify findings obtained with multinomial logistic regression and to per-
form analyses on smaller subgroups of our cohort that required methods with 
higher statistical power, we performed multivariable linear regression with the 
neutralization score as a continuous outcome variable. Supplementary Table 7 
 
shows an analysis with linear regression; Supplementary Tables 7–11 show 
analyses with Tobit linear regression. The latter provides a better fit for this 
type of data, as the distribution of scores is strongly truncated. In particular, we 
chose for the Tobit regression a lower limit (i.e., right truncation) of 0 to take 
into account the fact that scores below 0 are not possible (score 0 is the most 
frequently observed score value). Using Tobit regression we further assessed 
the influence of specific CD4 levels (Supplementary Table 8) and individual 
env subtypes (Supplementary Table 9) and ruled out confounding influences 
of the assessment method for the time of HIV acquisition in our cohort on the 
reported results (Supplementary Table 10).
We used the Rand index to compare the overlap of the antibody prediction 
according to the different prediction methods. For each of the bnAb types 
 
(V2 glycan, V3 glycan, CD4bs, MPER) and each prediction method (MSBP, 
MPBP, DAG, HCBP), we classified the plasmas into two groups—those 
 
belonging to the given bnAb type according to a given method and those 
not—and determined the overlap between this grouping across the different 
methods using the unadjusted and the adjusted Rand index59 (Supplementary 
Figs. 4b,c and 5b,c).
Owing to the relatively small number of specificity predictions, the associa-
tion of bnAb epitope specificity and subtype was tested with Fisher’s exact test 
(Fig. 5 and Supplementary Figs. 4d and 5d) and univariable and multivariable 
exact logistic regression, where we considered only ethnicity and subtype in the 
multivariable model (Fig. 5 and Supplementary Table 9).

Figure 1; data for Supplementary Figures 3–6 are listed in Supplementary
