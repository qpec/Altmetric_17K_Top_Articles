Abstract
Objectives—Sugar sweetened beverages (SSBs) are a major factor in the development of obesity 
and cardiometabolic disease. Shortened sleep duration has also been linked to increased appetite 
and obesity. Here, we examined whether there was an association between self-reported sleep 
duration and SSB consumption among adults aged 18 years and older.
Methods—Using data from 2005–12 NHANES we examined self- reported sleep duration and 
beverage intake (types of SSBs, juice, water, coffee, tea) from two 24-hour dietary recalls among 
18,779 adults. Adults who slept 7–8 hours/night were considered the reference group. Generalized 
linear models were computed adjusting for sociodemographics and health characteristics as well 
as total energy intake.
Results—Thirteen percent slept 5 or fewer hours per night. In fully adjusted models, those who 
slept 5 hours or less had 21% higher SSB consumption, (RD = 1.21, 95% CI 1.11–1.32). When 
broken down by beverage type this was due to caffeinated sugary beverages. Longer sleepers (≥9 
hour sleepers) consumed fewer servings of coffee and water. There were no associations between 
self-reported sleep duration and consumption of 100% juice, tea, or diet drinks.
Conclusions—Short sleep is associated with greater intake of sugared caffeinated sodas, a 
relationship which may have important, though unrecognized, implications for physical health. 
Directionality of this relationship cannot be determined from this study. While caffeinated drinks 
could account for impaired sleep, it is possible that short sleep could influence one’s appetitive

INTRODUCTION
Sugar sweetened beverages (SSBs) are the primary source of added sugar in the American 
diet (1). SSBs are linked to weight gain (2, 3) and increased incidence of coronary heart 
disease and type 2 diabetes (4–6). Epidemiologic data indicate that approximately 50% of 
the U.S. population consumes a SSB on any given day (7) and from the late 1970s to 2001 
there was a three-fold increase in SSB consumption (3.9% to 9.2% of calories consumed) 
(8). The new 2015–20 U.S Department of Agriculture (USDA) Dietary Guidelines 
recommends added sugar consumption be limited to less than 10% of an individual’s daily 
caloric intake (9). While the consumption of added sugars has declined in recent years, 
average consumption among Americans remains above recommended levels (10) (i.e., 88 
grams of sugar per day) (11); excess SSB consumption significantly contributes to these 
high levels.
Factors that contribute to SSB consumption are multifaceted, and include a range of social, 
environmental, and behavioral determinants. One factor that has received little attention is 
the role of sleep, despite the fact the growing cross-sectional and prospective evidence 
linking short sleep duration (e.g., sleeping less than 6 hours per night) to weight gain and 
obesity (12–15) as well as other negative physical health outcomes (e.g. type 2 diabetes (16–
19)) observed at greater frequency among those who consume high levels of SSBs.
The relationship between sleep and SSB consumption is likely complex. Experimental 
evidence indicates that acute and prolonged sleep loss can have substantial biologic and 
behavioral effects that may influence SSB consumption. For instance, adults exposed to 
either total or partial sleep restriction display alterations in satiety hormonal regulators such 
as ghrelin (20) and leptin (20, 21), report increases in hunger (20, 22), consume food beyond 
the energy costs of being awake (23), and report preferences for high fat, high carbohydrate-
rich foods (22, 24). In addition to food preferences, sleep loss also affects food choice. In 
this regard, compared to a night of normal sleep, participants who undergo a night of total 
sleep deprivation and then subjects to a food purchasing task were significantly more likely 
to use their fixed budget to purchase high caloric foods, including those high in fat and sugar 
(25). Alternatively, SSB consumption may result in shorter sleep duration. Many SSBs 
include caffeine, a well-recognized stimulant that increases alertness and, when consumed 
near bedtime, negatively influences one’s ability to sleep. Indeed, caffeine avoidance is one 
of the key components of sleep hygiene recommendations (26). Research on associations 
between sleep and SSB consumptions, in general, has been limited and there are no studies 
exploring the sleep-SSB link in adults.
If there is evidence that sleep duration is related to amount of SSB consumption, adequate 
sleep may serve as a viable intervention target for curbing weight-related disease risk.

 Accordingly, the aim of the present study was to examine the associations between self-
reported measures of sleep duration and sugar-sweetened beverage consumption in a 
nationally representative sample from the National Health and Nutrition Survey (NHANES).
PARTICIPANTS AND METHODS
Study Population
NHANES is an ongoing, multi-stage cross-sectional survey administered by the National 
Center for Health Statistics. NHANES is designed to be representative of the civilian, non-
institutionalized U.S. population and collects information on general health status, 
nutritional intake, health-related behaviors, and physiologic measurements from a 
questionnaire and a physical examination. This study combined data from 2005–12 
NHANES cycles (i.e., 2005–06; 2007–08; 2009–10; 2011–12), yielding data on 18,779 
adults aged 18 years and older.
Self-reported sleep
Questions about sleep habits and sleep disorders were added to the NHANES questionnaire 
beginning in 2005 and were asked to adults aged 16 years and older. Average sleep duration 
was calculated from the question, “How much sleep do you usually get on weekdays or 
workdays?” and collapsed into four categories: ≤5 hours/day, 6 hours/day, 7–8 hours/day, ≥9 
hours/day (27).
Sugar-sweetened beverage consumption
Two 24-hour dietary recalls were administered to NHANES study participants; the first was 
conducted in person, and the second was conducted over the phone 3–10 days after the 
examination. Data from the USDA Food and Nutrient Database for Dietary Studies were 
used to estimate dietary variables of interest.
Daily consumption (in 8 ounce servings) of beverages was estimated and averaged across 
two days of intake for each participant. Because our interest was in total SSB intake, we 
created a summary measure of total SSB consumption as our primary outcome, which 
included sugar-sweetened sodas (i.e., regular soda) and non-carbonated sugary beverages 
(e.g. fruit drinks, smoothies, sports drinks, energy drinks, flavored milk, sweetened coffee 
and tea drinks, and sweetened waters). We also included other frequently consumed 
beverages, such as 100% fruit juice, diet drinks (e.g. beverages containing artificial 
sweeteners), plain (unsweetened) coffee, plain (unsweetened) tea, and plain water. 
Beverages associated with sleep duration were further categorized into caffeinated and de-
caffeinated.
Study covariates
Covariates of interest included sociodemographics and health characteristics. 
Sociodemographic characteristics included age, gender, race/ethnicity (non-Hispanic White, 
non-Hispanic Black, Hispanic, other race/multiracial), highest level of education (< 12 
years, high school diploma or equivalent, some college, college graduate), ratio of household 
income to the federal poverty level (FPL; 0–100% FPL, 100–200% FPL, 200–300% FPL,

 300–400% FPL, >400% FPL), and marital status (married or living with partner, separated/
widowed/divorced, never married). Health characteristics and behaviors included smoking 
status (never, former, current), physical activity (sedentary, moderately active, vigorously 
active), self-reported health status (fair or poor, good, very good or excellent), and self-
reported diagnosis of a sleep disorder (yes/no). Total energy intake and survey year (e.g. 
2005–06; 2007–08; 2009–10; 2011–12) were also included as covariates. Missing indicators 
were used to account for missing information for educational level (n=17), marital status 
(n=713), household income (n=1394), smoking status (n=110), physical activity (n=1478), 
self-reported health status (n=1102) and diagnosis of a sleep disorder (n=24).
Statistical analysis
To make nationally representative estimates, complex dietary survey weights were used to 
account for different sampling probabilities and participation rates across the eight-year 
period. Individuals with an incomplete dietary recall, with total energy intake <500 or 
>5,000 calories, and women pregnant at the time of the survey were excluded from the 
analysis, resulting in an analytic sample of 18,779 participants.
Descriptive statistics were used to compare distributions of sociodemographic and health 
characteristics by sleep categories. To account for the skewed distribution of beverage 
intakes, we examined associations with sleep categories using generalized linear models 
(GLM), assuming a gamma distribution and log link. These results are interpreted as the 
relative differences (RD) in beverage intakes between groups, using 7–8 hours/day of sleep 
as the reference. Models were adjusted for all sociodemographic and health characteristics 
listed previously. All statistical significance tests were two-sided and significance was 
considered at P<0.05. Statistical analyses were performed using SAS 9.3 (SAS Institute Inc., 
Cary, NC) and Stata/ SE 12.1 (Stata Corp, College Station, TX).
RESULTS
Sample Characteristics
Of the 18,779 participants in this sample, 2,879 (weighted 13.0%) reported sleeping 5 or 
fewer hours per night while 4,350 (weighted 22.8%) reported 6 hours, 10,075 (weighted 
56.6%) reported between 7 and 8 hours, and 1,475 (weighted 7.7%) reported sleeping 9 or 
more hours per night (Table 1). Compared to other sleep categories, participants reporting 5 
or fewer hours of sleep were more likely to be Black, to have less than a high school 
education, have a lower household income, be separated, divorced or widowed, be a current 
smoker and sedentary, report fair/poor health, and diagnosed with a sleep disorder. 
Individuals sleeping 9 or more hours were also more likely to have lower household income 
and lower educational attainment when compared to 7 to 8 hour sleepers.
Sleep duration and sugar-sweetened beverage consumption
SSB consumption by sleep category is presented in Table 2. Total consumption of SSBs was 
greater with shorter sleep duration. More specifically, those who reported sleeping ≤5 hours 
per night on average consumed significantly more SSBs compared to individuals who slept 7 
to 8 hours per night independent of survey cycle, sociodemographic factors (age, sex, race/

 ethnicity, education level, household income, marital status), health characteristics (smoking 
status, physical activity, and self-reported health status, sleep disorder diagnosis) and total 
energy intake (RD = 1.21, 95% CI 1.11–1.32). Elevated levels of consumption were also 
observed among 6-hour sleepers (RD = 1.11, 95% CI 1.05–1.18) compared to 7–8 hour 
sleepers.
Examination of beverage type further illuminated the link between self-reported sleep 
duration and SSB consumption. In our models (Table 2), sleeping ≤5 hours was associated 
with 26% higher intake of sodas (RD = 1.26, 95% CI 1.13–1.40) and sleeping 6 hours was 
associated with 14% higher intake of sodas (RD = 1.14, 95% CI 1.04–1.25); ≤5 hours (RD = 
1.18, 95% CI 1.05–1.32) and 6-hour sleepers (RD = 1.09, 95% CI 1.01–1.19) also consumed 
significantly more non-carbonated sugary beverages compared to 7–8 hour sleepers. Self-
reported sleep duration was unrelated to diet drinks, 100% juice, and tea consumption. 
Individuals who reported sleeping ≥9 hours on average consumed less coffee and less water 
than 7–8 hour sleepers.
Sugar sweetened beverages were further categorized as caffeinated or decaffeinated. As 
displayed in Table 3, the consumption of decaffeinated SSBs was similar across sleep 
categories. In contrast, total consumption of caffeinated SSBs were 33% higher in ≤5 hours 
(RD = 1.33, 95% CI 1.18–1.50) and 15% higher in 6-hour sleepers (RD = 1.15, 95% CI 
1.06–1.26) compared to 7–8 hour sleepers. Greater consumption was observed among ≤5 
and 6 hour sleepers for both caffeinated sodas and caffeinated non-carbonated sugary drinks 
compared to 7–8 hour sleepers.
DISCUSSION
Sugar sweetened beverage consumption is one of the key dietary habits shown to contribute 
to the development and progression of several cardiometabolic conditions linked to obesity 
(1, 2); however, the factors that lead to excess SSB consumption are not well elucidated. In 
the present study, analyses revealed that short self-reported sleep duration (≤5 hours and 6 
hours per night) was associated with greater SSB consumption in a nationally representative 
sample of nearly 19,000 adults in the United States, after holding constant a bevy of 
sociodemographic factors (age, gender, race/ethnicity, marital status, level of education, 
household income), as well as health variables (total energy intake, smoking status, physical 
activity, self-reported health status, reports of sleep disorders). After these statistical 
adjustments, there was a dose response relationship with total consumption of SSBs was 
21% higher among ≤5 hour sleepers and 11% higher among 6 hour sleepers relative 7 to 8 
hour sleepers.
The association between sleep duration and total SSB consumption was observed when 
beverages were separated into sodas and non-carbonated sugary beverages; however, the 
effects appeared somewhat stronger for sodas. Indeed, compared to 7–8 hours sleepers, 
individuals who averaged ≤5 hours per night consumed 26% more sodas while this same 
category of sleepers consumed 18% more non-carbonated sugary beverages. Regardless of 
the source, such excess sugar consumption may have considerable health implications (3, 
28). For instance, high levels of fructose, such as those observed in sodas, have been linked

 to increased insulin resistance (29, 30), disruption in lipid processing (30), excess 
inflammation (31), oxidative damage (32), and the development of the metabolic syndrome 
(32, 33) and non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (32).
The present findings align with a small but emerging literature investigating sleep and SSBs 
in children and adolescents. In recent study of nearly 2,500 elementary school students, 
participants obtaining fewer hours of sleep than recommended for their age reported greater 
soda consumption than students obtaining “optimal” sleep (i.e., ≥10 hours/weekday) (34). In 
a study of 676 children (aged 8 to 11), shorter sleep duration, measured objectively using 
wrist actigraphy, was associated with greater SSB consumption (35); the present study is the 
first to extend these findings to a nationally representative sample of adults.
Associations in this sample varied as a function of caffeine content. In this regard, ≤5 hour 
and 6-hour sleepers reported greater consumption of caffeinated SSBs compared to 7–8 hour 
sleepers; such differences were not observed for de-caffeinated SSBs. As such, the excess 
consumption among shorter sleepers is most prominent in beverages with both added sugar 
and caffeine. It also raises the possibility that short sleepers may seek out caffeinated SSBs 
to increase alertness and stave off daytime sleepiness. Of course, an alternative explanation 
may be that excess caffeinated SSB consumption leads to shortened sleep duration. Indeed, 
experimental evidence suggests that regular caffeine consumption can result in significant 
decrements in sleep (36). High levels of consumption of beverages with the combination of 
high caffeine and sugar, such as energy drinks, has been raised as a cause of short sleep 
duration and the metabolic conditions that appear at high prevalence among short sleepers 
(e.g., type 2 diabetes) (37). Unfortunately, the cross-sectional nature of the data, including 
the lack of information about when a participant routinely consumes SSBs (e.g., during the 
day vs. near bedtime) precludes any inferences regarding the directionality of these findings.
This study is not without its limitations. As noted, the cross-sectional nature of the data 
precludes any clear inferences about causality or temporality. While accurate assessments of 
dietary intake are inherently challenging, the 24-hour dietary recall employed in the 
NHANES protocol uses the five-step multiple-pass method, which has been validated 
previously (38, 39) and is considered the best method for assessing population-level intakes 
(40). In contrast, sleep assessment relied on a single item self-report measure, which has not 
been validated using gold-standard measures (e.g., polysomnography). Studies examining 
associations of sleep with dietary intake using objective measures of sleep are needed. 
Additionally, while analyses adjusted for sociodemographic and health characteristics 
known to show prior associations with sleep and SSB consumption, other potential 
confounders (e.g., psychological stress, neighborhood socioeconomic status) unmeasured in 
NHANES may play a role in the sleep-SSB link. Replications and extensions of this work in 
large prospective cohort studies are warranted.
The long-term health consequences of excessive SSB consumption, including obesity, and 
economic burden that obesity and obesity-related medical conditions place on the health care 
system are substantial (41). There is a need to identify tractable behavioral pathways that 
may serve as opportunities for prevention. Self-control efforts are impaired by sleep debt 
(42). It may be that sufficient sleep can help bolster individual’s ability to resist SSBs when

 in a neighborhood or work environment highly saturated with SSB availability. These 
findings provide novel evidence that sleep duration may reflect a possible target for 
attenuating SSB consumption in adults, although there are likely bidirectional relationships 
between sleep and SSB consumption, particularly among caffeinated SSBs. Prospective 
studies tracking longitudinal changes in sleep and SSB consumption are warranted.
