SUMMARY
Combining DNA-demethylating agents (DNA methyltransferase inhibitors [DNMTis]) with 
histone deacetylase inhibitors (HDACis) holds promise for enhancing cancer immune therapy. 
Herein, pharmacologic and isoform specificity of HDACis are investigated to guide their addition 
to a DNMTi, thus devising a new, low-dose, sequential regimen that imparts a robust anti-tumor

 effect for non-small-cell lung cancer (NSCLC). Using in-vitro-treated NSCLC cell lines, we 
elucidate an interferon α/β-based transcriptional program with accompanying upregulation of 
antigen presentation machinery, mediated in part through double-stranded RNA (dsRNA) 
induction. This is accompanied by suppression of MYC signaling and an increase in the T cell 
chemoattractant CCL5. Use of this combination treatment schema in mouse models of NSCLC 
reverses tumor immune evasion and modulates T cell exhaustion state towards memory and 
effector T cell phenotypes. Key correlative science metrics emerge for an upcoming clinical trial, 
testing enhancement of immune checkpoint therapy for NSCLC.
In Brief
Myc depletion through combined epigenetic therapy reverses immune evasion and enables 
effective treatment of lung cancer.
INTRODUCTION
The development of effective therapeutic approaches for patients with lung cancer, the 
world’s leading cause of cancer-related death, is a critical medical need. The advent of 
immune checkpoint therapy has been a tremendous step forward (Borghaei et al., 2015; 
Garon et al., 2015; Reck et al., 2016), but only a minority of unselected patients benefit. 
Thus, identifying rational combinations to augment anti-tumor immunity and increase the 
response to immune checkpoint therapy represents a major challenge for the field. Durable 
responses were observed in patients with non-small-cell lung cancer (NSCLC) who were 
initially treated with a DNA methyltransferase inhibitor (DNMTi) combined with 
intermittent histone deacetylase inhibitor (HDACi), followed by immune checkpoint therapy 
(Juergens et al., 2011). Combination epigenetic therapy regimens most commonly utilize 
DNMTis in combination with HDACis on the premise that the latter can enhance re-
expression of abnormally silenced genes mediated by abnormal gene promoter DNA 
methylation (Cameron et al., 1999; Jones et al., 2016). However, little attention has been

 paid to examining the specific pharmacologic features of HDACi, optimal dosing strategy, 
and underlying mechanisms mediating maximal synergy with DNMTis. The zinc-chelating 
HDACis comprise 3 major classes: benzamide, hydroxamic acid, and cyclic tetrapeptides 
(Bradner et al., 2010; Falkenberg and Johnstone, 2014; Rasheed et al., 2007; Zahnow et al., 
2016). Benzamide class HDACis target class I HDAC isoforms, while hydroxamic acid class 
HDACis target both class I (HDAC1, 2, and 3) and class IIb (HDAC6), although differences 
in isoform targeting can be noted (Bradner et al., 2010).
We have previously shown that low doses of DNMTi impart durable changes in both 
genome-wide DNA methylation and transcriptome while avoiding acute cytotoxicity (Tsai et 
al., 2012). Additionally, we and others have discovered that DNMTis can induce an 
epithelial immune signature for NSCLC and other cancers (Li et al., 2014; Moreno-Bost et 
al., 2011; Oi et al., 2009; Weiser et al., 2001; Wrangle et al., 2013). A key mediator of this 
signaling is a cytoplasmic, double-stranded RNA (dsRNA)-mediated interferon response 
induced through the activation of endogenous retrovirus (ERV) transcription (Chiappinelli et 
al., 2015; Roulois et al., 2015). How the distinct classes of HDACis contribute to enhancing 
immune therapy specifically is unknown.
Herein, testing individual HDACis based on both their isoform-specific inhibitory constant 
(Ki) and pharmacokinetic parameters, we demonstrate the best pairing of these agents with 
Aza for achieving anti-tumor effects, which include immune responses. The combination of 
HDACi + Aza achieves robust anti-tumor responses mediated by reducing MYC-driven cell 
proliferation with enhancement of immune signaling. We hypothesize dual epigenetic 
therapy will synergize with immune checkpoint blockade in NSCLC patients to drive a 
potent anti-tumor response.
RESULTS
Combination Aza + ITF-2357 Induces Profound Drug Synergy when Applied to Human 
NSCLC
We tested HDACis by pairing these agents with low-dose (500 nM) Aza. Clinically relevant 
HDACis (ITF-2357, MGCD-0103, and MS-275) were selected and paired with Aza based 
on their known pharmacokinetic parameters (serum maximum concentration [Cmax] and 
half-life) and enzymatic Ki against key HDAC isoforms (Figure S1A) (Bradner et al., 2010; 
Falkenberg and Johnstone, 2014; Furlan et al., 2011; Gore et al., 2008; Rasheed et al., 2007; 
Ryan et al., 2005; Zahnow et al., 2016). We initially examined the effect of sequential Aza + 
HDACi on cell proliferation across a panel of 16 cell lines representing the diverse 
oncogenotypes of NSCLC (Figures 1A, S1B, and S1C). These data revealed that the 
antiproliferative effect of this treatment regimen correlated with the subtype and mutational 
status of the NSCLC cell line queried. The hydroxamic acid class HDACi (ITF-2357) in 
combination with Aza demonstrated the most potent antiproliferative phenotype. Among our 
four most responsive cell lines, three were RAS mutant subtype. Therefore, we selected 
these cell lines for further studies of therapeutic scheduling and HDAC isoform targeting 
delineation. Using a comparative analysis, wherein Aza and ITF-2357 were both 
sequentially and concurrently employed (Figure S1C), only the former schedule induced 
both synergy and robust potentiation of HDACi by Aza (Figures 1B, 1C, S1D, and S1E). We

 thus used this schema of sequential treatment in our further studies. To delineate the 
enhanced antiproliferative effect of ITF-2357 over the others, we next tested the function of 
the individual HDAC isoforms in the Aza priming response to HDACi. We found, through 
the application of HDAC isoform-specific inhibitors, an Aza induced priming to both class I 
and IIb targeting HDACis (Figures 1D and 1E). These data suggest the observed Aza + 
ITF-2357 antiproliferative phenotype to be the result of broader targeting of HDACs, 
including both nuclear (HDAC1, 2, and 3) and non-nuclear isoforms (HDAC6).
As a further characterization of the antiproliferative effects of Aza in combination with 
HDACi, we deployed equal molar concentrations of MS-275 and ITF-2357 and assessed cell 
proliferation specifically. In agreement with the previous data, we found 100 nM ITF-2357, 
a concentration roughly one-third Cmax (Furlan et al., 2011), demonstrated a more robust 
inhibition of proliferation than 100 nM MS-275 (Figure S1F). We next sought to define the 
contribution of individual HDAC isoforms to the antiproliferative effect noted from 100 nM 
ITF-2357. To accomplish this end, we first determined equivalent doses based on isoform 
pharmacodynamic targets, these being histone acetylation for HDAC1 and 2 and tubulin 
acetylation for HDAC6 (Asthana et al., 2013; Fournel et al., 2008; Khan et al., 2008). The 
resulting equivalent doses were 200 nM MGCD0103 and 1,000 nM Tubastatin A to mimic 
100 nM ITF-2357 (Figure S1G). Selection of 2,000 nM RGFP996 for HDAC3 inhibitor was 
based on extrapolation of Ki, due to a lack of known pharmacodynamic markers for these 
isoforms (Malvaez et al., 2013). These normalized doses of HDAC isoform-specific 
inhibitors identified HDAC1, 2, and 3 as key arbiters of the Aza + ITF-2357 antiproliferative 
actions (Figure S1H). Additionally, to elucidate the specificity of Aza priming to HDACi, 
we deployed small hairpin RNA (shRNA)-mediated DNMT1 depletion, the major 
pharmacodynamic target of Aza (Cai et al., 2014). We observed potent augmentation of the 
HDACi antiproliferative effect when utilized in combination with DNMT1 depletion 
(Figures S1I and S1J).
Finally, we tested the efficacy of sequential Aza + HDACi in vivo using immune-
incompetent mice. We observed a significant reduction of tumor burden across 3 xenograft 
models, two for established NSCLC cell lines and one using a KRAS, KDR, TP53 mutant 
primary patient-derived xenograft (PDX) model when utilizing Aza + ITF-2357 (Figures 
1F–1H). The combination of Aza + MS-275 did not have significant efficacy in the H460 
xenograft model, the most sensitive cell line tested, at the doses used in our study (Figure 
1F). Aza + MGCD0103 achieved significant efficacy in H460 xenografts (Figure S1K) and 
modest efficacy in the patient-derived xenograft (Figure S1L).
Effects of the Drug Combination Paradigm on the Transcriptome in NSCLC Lines
Assessment of drug combination-induced effects on gene expression yields important insight 
into signaling pathway alterations that may relate to eventual clinical efficacy. The 
combination epigenetic treatment induced an increase in differential gene expression relative 
to HDACi mono-treatment conditions, with a clear advantage noted from the application of 
Aza + ITF-2357 (Figures 2A, S2A, and S2B). Clustering of the top 500 differentially 
expressed genes showed a divergence between HDACi mono-treatment and Aza-containing 
regimens (Figure 2B). Database for Annotation, Visualization and Integrated Discovery

 (DAVID) pathway analysis revealed the most differentially expressed pathways to be 
immune, MYC, and metabolism related (Figure 2C). Gene set enrichment analysis (GSEA) 
identified three significantly induced pathways by combination epigenetic treatment, two of 
which are related to immune signaling (Figures 2D and 2E). The interferon alpha/beta 
(IFNα/β)-signaling pathway was the most prominent of these altered pathways (Figure 
S2C). Comparative analysis of combination epigenetic treatment-downregulated pathways 
by GSEA revealed a conserved cell cycle repression signature across the drug combinations 
tested, with a noted advantage for Aza + ITF-2357 (Figures 2F, 2G, and S2D). The above 
transcriptional downregulation of cell cycle-related pathways elicited by combinatorial 
epigenetic treatment matched with the observed proliferative arrest induced by combination 
epigenetic treatment (Figures S1F).
The Potential of Combinatorial Epigenetic Treatment to Stimulate Specific Immune-Related 
Genes
A primary goal for combined epigenetic therapy is to increase the efficacy of immune 
checkpoint and other immunotherapies. We found the combination of Aza + ITF-2357 to be 
the most effective relative to other conditions tested in terms of induction of IFNα/β 
pathway-related genes, including those associated with antigen presentation (Figures 3A, 
3B, and S3A). To demonstrate whether this efficacy of immune gene induction by Aza + 
ITF-2357 was potency or isoform targeting based, we used isoform-specific HDACi at 
concentrations mimicking 100 nM ITF-2357. We observed the inhibition of HDAC1, 2 
(MGCD0103), and HDAC6 (Tubastatin A) in combination with Aza, induced IFNα/β 
pathway-related genes, including antigen presentation, while HDAC3- (RGFP996) specific 
inhibitors demonstrated no significant induction of these genes (Figures 3C–3F, S3B, and 
S3C).
We also compared the efficacy of ITF-2357 against another hydroxamic acid derivative 
HDACi (SAHA). Using doses at equal ratio of Cmax for the respective inhibitors, we 
observed a superior augmentation of interferon genes by ITF-2357 when deployed in 
combination with Aza (Figures S3D and S3E). The above data demonstrates an induction of 
interferon-stimulated genes by Aza, which are further augmented by HDACi’s targeting 
isoforms 1, 2, and 6.
Cancer/testis antigens are epigenetic-treatment responsive and have an established role in 
facilitating the recognition of tumors through immune surveillance (Moreno-Bost et al., 
2011; Oi et al., 2009; Weiser et al., 2001). We found, in agreement with previous studies, the 
expression of cancer/testis antigens are Aza inducible, but a significant additional benefit is 
noted with the combination of Aza + ITF-2357 (Figures S4A–S4D).
The augmentation of the IFNα/β pathway by Aza partially relies on increasing dsRNA 
species, including ERV transcripts (Chiappinelli et al., 2015; Roulois et al., 2015; Stengel et 
al., 2010; Strissel et al., 2012). Indeed, combination HDACi with Aza transcriptionally 
induced multiple ERVs across all cell lines tested (Figures 3G, 3H, S4E, and S4F). We found 
ERV9-1 to be the most differentially expressed ERV induced by Aza + ITF-2357. Using 
isoform-specific inhibitors in combination with Aza, we determined its transcription is 
potentiated most robustly by inhibition of HDAC6 (a cytoplasmic HDAC) (Figures 3I and 
Topper et al.

 3J). Further, we demonstrated using DNMT1-targeting shRNA that ERV9-1 induction 
specifically resulted from DNMT1 depletion in our combination treatment (Figure S4G). 
The inducibility of interferon signaling from ERV transcription was linked in our NSCLC 
cells, as single ERV overexpression induced transcription of OASL, an interferon-responsive 
gene (Figure S4H).
In summary, HDACis enhance Aza-induced interferon-responsive gene transcription, 
particularly with the inhibition of HDAC1, 2, and 6. Class I antigen presentation is 
augmented through the inhibition of HDAC1, 2, 3, and 6 in combination with Aza. The 
induction of cancer/testis antigen transcription requires potent HDACis, such as ITF-2357, 
to mediate significant upregulation over Aza alone.
Perturbation of MYC by Aza Drives Sensitization to HDACi
As described earlier, DAVID analysis of the top 500 differentially expressed genes revealed 
that three of the top eight pathways are MYC related (Figure 2C), suggesting the 
perturbation of MYC as a key target of our epigenetic therapy. Critically, in the tested 
NSCLC cell lines, Aza produced a significant transcriptional downregulation of MYC, with 
an at least 1.4-fold reduction observed across all cell lines assayed (Figure 4A). These 
transcription data correlated with downregulation of MYC protein in A549 and H460 cells 
(Figure 4A). Additional assessment of MYC protein downregulation by Aza and priming to 
sequential HDACi across a panel of NSCLC cell lines of varying oncogenotypes revealed a 
significant correlation between the degree of downregulation and HDACi sensitization by 
Aza (Figures 4A and S5A). Combinatorial Aza + HDACi acted to further deplete MYC over 
Aza treatment alone (Figure S5B). The application of Aza and Aza + HDACi treatment 
induced potent repression of the top 200 MYC targets (Figure 4B). Importantly, knockdown 
of MYC protein phenocopied the Aza sensitization of NSCLC to HDACi-induced cytostasis 
(Figures 4C and S5C). The stable over-expression of MYC partially rescued the Aza-
induced sensitization to HDACi-induced cell depletion (Figures 4D and S5D). These data 
indicated an Aza-induced MYC depletion as a potent sensitizer to HDACi-induced 
proliferative arrest, and, accordingly, they implicate depletion of MYC signaling as a driver 
of these events.
High MYC tumors have been reported to display resistance to IFNγ signaling and the action 
of cytotoxic T lymphocytes (Casey et al., 2016; Schlee et al., 2007a, 2007b). In this regard, 
exogenous MYC overexpression resulted in antagonism of interferon-stimulated gene 
induction and antigen presentation induced by epigenetic treatment (Figures 4E and 4F). 
Thus, the MYC depletion signature imparted by Aza sensitizes to the actions of HDACi-
induced cytostasis and augments NSCLC interferon signaling.
Combination Epigenetic Treatment Exerts a Robust Anti-tumor Effect and Decreases myc 
and myc Pathway Signaling in Mouse Models of NSCLC
The translational potential for utilizing our chronic schema of alternating, low-dose 1-week 
Aza followed by 1-week ITF-2357 was apparent from its robust efficacy when tested in two 
mouse models of NSCLC. The first, the LSL-KrasG12D mouse model of NSCLC, 
represented an interception model, as we began treatment when lung adenomas emerged 16

 weeks following the lung-specific activation of the mutation (Jackson et al., 2001). Mice 
were treated with the combination drug treatment for 3 months using the schema as shown 
in Figure S6A. The therapy was well tolerated, and, while mock-treated mice developed 
large adenocarcinoma lesions in the lungs, combination epigenetic treatment prevented the 
occurrence of these macroscopic lesions and caused over a 60% reduction of tumor area in 
the treated mice (Figures 5A, 5B, and S6B). Consistent with all the studies in the human 
NSCLC cells, proliferation as assessed by Ki67 positivity was markedly reduced in any 
remaining histologic, adenomatous lesions (Figure 5C). To evaluate the implications of this 
treatment regimen in combination with immune checkpoint blockade, we added treatment 
with anti-PD1 antibody to the described regimen (Figure S6C). However, the combination 
epigenetic therapy alone proved as above to be so efficacious that it fully dominated the 
therapeutic effect (Figure S6D).
The translational potential for our combination epigenetic drug efficacy for established, 
aggressive NSCLC was apparent utilizing a second mouse model of NSCLC, Lewis Lung 
Carcinoma (LLC). This murine model has demonstrated high correlation between response 
in the animal and response in the clinic for 2 therapeutic regimens (Kellar et al., 2015). 
Treatment with our alternating schedule of Aza + ITF-2357 and of Aza + MGCD0103 for 1 
month not only reduced growth of established and rapidly growing primary tumor explants 
of the LLC cells but also dramatically reduced metastatic occurrence and burden (Figures 
5D, 5E, S6E, and S6F).
Importantly, as outlined below, the above efficacy of our combination therapy was 
accompanied by profound immune effects. First, in the LSL-KrasG12D mice, the 
combination epigenetic treatment profoundly altered the tumor transcriptome with 5,167 
significantly upregulated and 4,540 downregulated genes (Figure 5F). This corresponded to 
18 gene sets upregulated and 52 gene sets downregulated by GSEA, with the former 
predominantly associated with immune parameters and the latter with cell cycle pathways 
(Figure 5G). Similar to the results for human NSCLC lines, 12 of the 18 gene sets 
upregulated involved strong induction of cytokine- and interferon-related gene sets (Figure 
5H) as well as for 24 genes involved with inflammatory responses (Figure 5I). 
Concomitantly, as for the human NSCLC lines, most of the downregulated cell cycle 
pathways involved myc pathway signaling (Figure 5J), with decreases in 30 myc pathway-
related genes (Figure 5K). Likewise, we confirmed the downregulation of MYC protein in 
the LLC cells (Figure S6G). These data in total demonstrate a potent reduction in tumor 
proliferation, growth, and burden is induced by the combination epigenetic treatment, which 
is mediated by repression of myc and myc-related signaling.
Combination Epigenetic Treatment Alters the Tumor Immune Microenvironment
In the above mouse models, deployment of epigenetic treatment reversed tumor immune 
evasion status, and a significant perturbation of tumor-associated immune cell subsets 
appeared to underlie the efficacy of the drug combinations. First, there was a robust 
alteration in the distribution of F4/80+ macrophages, which have been shown to have an 
established role in the progression of the LSL-KrasG12D mouse model (Okayama et al., 
2013). These cells have been shown to basally infiltrate tumors induced in this model, and

 our combination treatment resulted in a significant decrease in their numbers (Figure 6A). 
Transcriptional profiling of tumor-associated macrophages (TAMs) isolated by fluorescence-
activated cell sorting (FACS) of F4/80hi, CD11b+ macrophages from the lungs, following the 
3 months of combination epigenetic treatment, revealed differential expression of 1,104 
genes (Figure 6B), including significant downregulation of angiogenesis and hypoxia-
responsive genes and gene sets (Figure 6C). These observed perturbations appeared to be a 
direct effect of the treatment and not a function of tumor stage, as treatment of normal bone 
marrow-derived macrophages (BMDMs) in vitro induced angiogenic signature 
downregulation as part of the 2,295 differentially expressed genes (Figures 6D and 6E).
The above altered pathways in TAMs may have implications for mediating CD8+ T cell 
intra-tumor infiltration. The inhibition of angiogenesis has proved efficacious in the MMTV 
mouse model through facilitating an increase in CD8+ tumor-infiltrating lymphocytes 
(Huang et al., 2012). This anti-angiogenic-based strategy for the induced infiltration of T 
lymphocytes depends on the concept of vascular normalization (Huang et al., 2013). 
Therefore, the repression of angiogenic programs in macrophages may act locally in the 
tumor to create a more immune infiltrate-permissive environment in the LSL-KrasG12D.
Critically, there were increased CD8+ tumor-infiltrating lymphocytes (TILs) in the tumor 
microenvironment of treated mice (Figure 6F). This enhanced TIL accumulation was 
accompanied by an IFNγ-responsive signature in the transcriptional profile of LSL-
KrasG12D whole-tumor lysates (Figure 6G). As a validation of this signature, we profiled 
TILs by FACS in the LLC model, and, although we did not observe changes in total CD8 
numbers in this short-term treatment model, there was a 2.25-fold increase in CD8+ IFNγ 
positivity, as the result of exposure to epigenetic treatment (Figures 6H, S6H, and S6I).
Transcriptional profiling of TILs from control and treated tumors in the LSL-KrasG12D mice 
suggested a key role of epigenetic therapy on these cells. TILs are known to acquire an 
exhaustion state in response to continuous stimuli and interaction with inhibitory ligands 
(Wherry and Kurachi, 2015; Zehn and Wherry, 2015). Therefore, the reversion or prevention 
of this exhausted state remains a major hurdle for durable T cell-mediated anti-tumor 
responses. A recent study by Ghoneim et al. (2017) established the utility of demethylating 
agents to reverse CD8+ T cell exhaustion, thereby allowing this population to be actionable 
by PD-1 blockade. Our epigenetic treatment regimen induced alteration of the TIL 
transcriptome. Comparative analysis of our 3,698 differentially expressed TIL genes 
revealed downregulation of exhaustion-associated genes and induction of activation- and 
memory-associated genes, as defined by Wherry et al. (2007). Our gene signature reflected 
an admixture of increased memory and/or effector T cells (Figures 6I–6K). The expansion of 
effector/memory T cell population is associated with durable responses to immune 
checkpoint blockade (Ribas et al., 2016). Thus, through the deployment of epigenetic 
treatment in two animal models, we confirmed epigenetic treatment can both increase 
activated CD8s in an inflamed tumor and induce the attraction of CD8s to an immune desert 
tumor.

 Combination Epigenetic Treatment Inhibits Tumor Growth through CD8+ T Cells and MYC-
Dependent Mechanisms
The above results demonstrated that epigenetic therapy can potentially reduce a key barrier 
to immune therapy, namely, the failure of tumors to attract functional CD8+ T cells. 
Depleting CD8+ T cells in the LLC mouse model attenuated the efficacy of epigenetic 
treatment on the reduction of primary tumor burden (Figures 7A and S6J). Relative to the 
Aza + ITF-2357 efficacy established in Figure 5, we also observed an increase in both 
metastatic frequency and burden as the result of CD8 depletion. In the CD8-depleted 
environment, we noted a metastatic frequency of 33% in mock- and 20% in Aza + 
ITF-2357-treated mice (Figure 7B).
Additionally, in response to our combined epigenetic treatment, there was transcriptional 
augmentation of CCL5, a secreted chemokine involved in lymphocyte attraction (Figures 7C 
and S6K). Importantly, protein levels of CCL5 also accumulated in bronchoalveolar lavage 
of mice treated with combination epigenetic therapy (Figure 7D). This protein and its ligand 
have been identified as the primary factors influencing T cell infiltration of melanoma post-
chemotherapy (Hong et al., 2011), thus suggesting that the enhanced levels of CCL5 induced 
by the epigenetic treatment may contribute to the increased number of CD8+ T cells 
observed in tumors of treated mice.
Several key findings suggest the importance of the above CCL5 results and link this 
parameter with the combination treatment-mediated downregulation of MYC signaling. 
First, expression of exogenous MYC in human A549 NSCLC cells acts as a potent repressor 
of CCL5 transcriptional induction in response to epigenetic treatment (Figure 7E). This links 
perturbation of MYC by epigenetic treatment to the alteration of immune correlates. Second, 
the potentially repressive role of MYC on CCL5 is also apparent in The Cancer Genome 
Atlas (TCGA) project primary NSCLC, lung adenocarcinoma (LUAD) samples, wherein 
there is an inverse relationship between CCL5 and MYC RNA transcription (Figure 7F).
Finally, our new findings in a small, previously reported cohort of patients with NSCLC 
treated with immune checkpoint therapy (Anagnostou et al., 2017) provide a suggestion for 
the importance of the present pre-clinical findings for the role of MYC signaling in response 
to immune therapy. In these four patients, all but one achieved durable clinical benefit, with 
partial responses for greater than 6 months as defined by RECIST 1.1. Genome-wide copy-
number variation analysis on the tumors of these patients revealed a significant amplification 
of the MYC locus only in the one patient who did not achieve durable benefit (Figures 7G 
and 7H). Of note, the tumors from all four patients had characteristics predicting favorable 
response to checkpoint blockade therapy (Anagnostou et al., 2017), including high PD-L1 
protein expression and high mutation density (Rizvi et al., 2015; Tumeh et al., 2014). These 
data, which must be validated in larger patient cohorts, suggest a predictive value when 
considering both the genetic and expression status of MYC for monitoring outcomes and 
practicing precision medicine for patients with NSCLC and other cancers receiving immune 
checkpoint therapy.

 DISCUSSION
We have derived pre-clinical data supporting a role for epigenetic therapy in decreasing 
MYC signaling and driving a substantial anti-tumor response associated with a reversion of 
an immune evasion phenotype. We describe a novel regimen using careful selection of 
specific HDACis in combination with Aza. We find the inhibition of HDAC1, 2, and 3 
isoforms is key for inducing a profound proliferative arrest (Figure S1H). The inhibition of 
HDAC6 appears to play a more important role in interferon signaling (Figures 3C–3F), 
possibly involving its known function for regulating Stat-1-dependent nuclear factor κB 
(NF-κB) signaling (Krämer et al., 2006).
We find these HDACis can complement the therapeutic effects of Aza across a diverse panel 
of NSCLC cell lines, thus suggesting its applicability for the treatment of NSCLC (Figures 
1A and S1B). Our observation of a strong correlation between both MYC basal levels and 
degree of downregulation by Aza suggests the importance of MYC assessment for the 
delineation of patients most likely to respond to epigenetic treatment (Figures 4A and S5A).
The best indication of the translational potential for our combination epigenetic therapy are 
the results achieved by treating two mouse models of NSCLC (Figure 5). These models 
allow for our observations that the epigenetic treatment alters the intra-tumor localization 
and functional status of key immune cell populations (Figure 6). This occurs concurrently 
with a decrease in MYC pathway signaling (Figures 5K and S6G). The importance of MYC 
in driving tumor formation in the LSL-KrasG12D mouse model has been established, wherein 
the inhibition of MYC and its targets has been shown to eradicate lung tumor lesions 
(Soucek et al., 2013).
Although the above anti-tumor responses are partly driven by the direct growth inhibitory 
effects of the therapy as observed in immune-incompetent mice (Figures 1F–1H, S1K, and 
S1L), we also observed a significant alteration of immune populations mediated by our 
therapeutic paradigm when treating immune-competent mouse models (Figures 6A–6K, 7A, 
7B, S6I, and S6J). The crucial role of the CD8+ T cells in driving the anti-tumor response is 
apparent from the significant attenuation of the anti-tumor response in the immune-
competent mice following CD8+ T cell depletion (Figures 7A, 7B, and S6J). Our 
observation of decreased angiogenic potential of TAMs post-treatment has implications in 
tumor vascularization, which is essential for the growth of large adenocarcinoma lesions 
(Figures 6B and 6C). Key among these findings is the effect of epigenetic treatment duration 
on the modulation of T cell fate. A critical observation is that application of epigenetic 
treatment for limited duration induces the accumulation of activated T effector cells (Figure 
6H and S6I), while chronic, long-term treatment induces modulation away from an 
exhausted T cell phenotype, inducing a profile more indicative of the formation of effector-
memory T cells (Figures 6J and 6K). This acquisition of a memory phenotype coupled with 
intra-tumor accumulation of activated T cells imparts an immunological landscape primed 
for durable response to immune checkpoint therapy (Ribas et al., 2016).
A final point for high translational implications is our linking epigenetic therapy-induced 
attraction of CD8+ T cells to the tumor microenvironment and the relationship of this event

 with decreased MYC signaling. An important parameter altered, which may have 
implications for the induced infiltration of CD8+ T cells into the tumor microenvironment, is 
the simultaneous upregulation of CCL5 protein secretion into the bronchoalveolar 
compartment (Figure 7D). The forced overexpression of this secreted protein has been found 
to induce recruitment of T cells (Lavergne et al., 2004). Notably, others have found higher 
levels of CCL5 to be an independent prognostic indicator for longer overall survival, with an 
induction of an active tumor-associated lymphocyte compartment in NSCLC patients 
(Moran et al., 2002).
In patient tumors, CCL5 augmentation by epigenetic therapy may prove crucial both 
functionally and as a biomarker in pre- and post-epigenetic treatment. As a biomarker, these 
data indicate that such findings for basal levels of CCL5 may be especially valuable when 
combined with the other markers studied, such as the genetic and expression status of MYC. 
Considering these relationships may enable the prediction of those patients most likely to 
respond to a combination of epigenetic and immune therapy. Specifically, based on our 
corollary hypothesis, patients with MYC-high, CCL5-low tumors could be those who most 
benefit from this combination.
In summary, we believe that combination epigenetic therapy-induced depletion of MYC can 
remove a barrier to interferon responsiveness, potentiate T cell attraction, and cause direct 
antiproliferative actions. This coupled with the reversion of T cell exhaustion and acquisition 
of a T cell memory fate suggests the potential for use of epigenetic therapy in combination 
with immune checkpoint blockade. Our early findings for MYC amplification in the one of 
four patients who had a much less robust initial response to immune checkpoint response 
than the others who achieved durable clinical benefit are in keeping with the need to further 
pursue these findings in the clinic (Figures 7G and 7H). In this regard, the work in our 
present study and the hypotheses derived are being pursued in the aforementioned clinical 
trial for patients with NSCLC, testing our combined epigenetic therapy with the DNA-
demethylating agent Guadecitabine plus the HDACi Mocetinostat plus anti-PD1 
(NCT03220477).

EXPERIMENTAL MODEL AND SUBJECT DETAILS
Cell lines and cell culture—Non small cell lung cancer cell lines used in the study were 
obtained from ATCC. The cells were cultured in RPMI1640 media (Corning) containing 
FBS (Hyclone) at 10% v/v. Cells were maintained at 37°C in the presence of 5% CO2. Cells 
were passaged every 3 days. Human Non Small Cell Lung Cancer cell lines: NCI-H1755 
(female), NCI-H520 (male), NCI-H1650 (male), NCI-H1975 (female), NCI-H441 (male), 
NCI-H661 (male), NCI-H596 (male), HCC4006 (male), NCI-H1703 (male), NCI-H838 
(male), NCI-H2170 (male), NCI-H1792 (male), NCI-H460 (male), NCI-H23 (male), A-549 
(male), NCI-H1299 (male), HCC827 (female)
In Vivo Mouse Studies
Xenograft studies in NOD/SCID mice: We used male NOD-SCID mice (5–6 weeks old) 
for these studies. Mice were bred and housed at the Johns Hopkins Animal care facility. All 
animal experiments were approved by the Johns Hopkins Animal Care and Use Committee. 
All animal care and protocols followed were in accordance with guidelines of the 
institutional Animal Care and Use Committee (IACUC). Mice were injected subcutaneously 
in the flank with 2.0 × 105 viable cells for H1299 and 5.0 × 104 viable cells H460 cells in

 0.2 mL of RPMI with Matrigel (1:1). Drug treatments were started 10 days post injection for 
H460 and 14 days post injection for H1299, when palpable tumors could be discerned and 
continued as indicated in the figure. Mice were treated with the dosing schedules shown in 
(Figure S6A). Treatment was continued for the entire duration of the study and mice were 
sacrificed before tumors volume exceeded 2000 mm3. Tumor volume determined by 
measurements obtained from digital caliper and calculated as V = 0.5(LxWxH).
PDX mouse model—A PDX mouse model (TM00302) was obtained from Jackson 
Laboratories. This model was derived from metastatic lung adenocarcinoma in a female 
patient with the following mutations KRAS G12D, KDR Q472H, TP53 R158L. The tumor was 
harvested from a JAX provided donor mouse and sectioned into 2 mm3 fragments. These 
fragments were then implanted subcutaneously in the flank of male NSG mice (5–6 weeks 
old). Once implanted tumors were palpable, mice were randomized into three treatment 
groups and dosed as depicted in Figure S6A. Mice were treated for the duration of the study 
and at culmination of treatment mice were sacrificed. Tumors were excised from the animals 
and weighed as a measure of disease burden.
LSL-KrasG12D mouse model—LSL-KrasG12D mice (Jackson et al., 2001) were obtained 
from Jackson laboratories and bred with wild-type C57BL/6 mice to generate heterozygous 
LSL-KrasG12D mice. LSL-KrasG12D mice (8–10 weeks, both genders) were infected 
intratracheally with Adenoviral vectors encoding Cre (obtained from University of Iowa) to 
activate Kras. LSL-KrasG12D mice harbor a latent point mutant allele of Kras (KrasG12D) 
and infection with an adenoviral vector encoding Cre leads to Cre-mediated deletion of a 
transcriptional termination sequence (Lox-Stop-Lox, LSL) and the oncogenic Kras 
production, thereby resulting in very high frequency of lung tumors (Jackson et al., 2001). 
All experimental animal protocols were performed in accordance with guidelines approved 
by the animal care and use committee at the Johns Hopkins University (Baltimore, MD). 
Mice were examined for presence of disease at 16 weeks post infection with AdenoCre. 
Mice were sacrificed and lungs were examined histologically. At this stage most of the mice 
showed presence of significant regions of hyperplasia as well as adenomas. Drug treatments 
were started as per the schedule shown in Figure S6A. Mice were divided in two groups. 
One group was injected with vehicle control while the other was injected with combination 
epigenetic therapeutics. Mice were uniformly distributed into the two treatment groups so 
that each group had comparable numbers of age and weight matched male and female mice. 
Drug treatments were continued for 12 weeks, following which mice were sacrificed and the 
lungs processed for histological studies, RNA extraction and analysis of cytokine levels in 
lung bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL) fluid as described as described in main methods.
Lewis lung Carcinoma (LLC) model—LLC cells (LLC1, ATCC) 2.0 × 104 were 
injected subcutaneously in flanks of male C57BL6 mice (6–8 weeks old) obtained from 
Harlan. LLC1 cells were suspended in 100uL RPMI + Matrigel (1:1). Drug treatments were 
started 7 days post injection when palpable tumors could be discerned. Mice were injected 
with drugs as per the dosing schema in Figure S6A. Treatment was continued for a month 
and at the culmination of study mice were sacrificed, tumors were harvested and weighed.

 Lungs of these mice were inflated and fixed in formaldehyde for 24 hours prior to sectioning 
and staining with H&E stains.
LLC model CD8 depletion model—CD8a antibody (BioXcell, 2.43 clone) mediated 
CD8 depletion of male C57BL6 mice was initiated 3 days prior to onset of treatment (Day 4 
post implantation). Implantation and therapeutic treatment of CD8 depleted LLC model is 
described in Lewis Lung Carcinoma model section of methods. For CD8 depletion mice 
were injected IP with 150ug of CD8a antibody (BioXcell, 2.43 clone), three times per week 
throughout the duration of study. CD8 depletion was verified by assessment of CD8% of 
CD45 population in the spleen of depleted sample versus control samples. Treatment was 
continued for one month and at the culmination of study mice were sacrificed, tumors were 
harvested and weighed. Lungs of these mice were inflated and fixed in formaldehyde for 24 
hours prior to sectioning and staining with H&E stains.

(1.0*103), NCI-H1299 (1.0*103), HCC827 (2.0*103). Cells were allowed to adhere for 24 
hours in the presence of complete media prior to the onset of treatment. Adhered cells were 
incubated with 100uL drug supplemented media changed every 3 days, treated with 
DMSO(vehicle) at 0.1% or the following drugs/concentrations standardized to 0.1% DMSO 
final concentration. ITF-2357: 25nM, 50nM, 100nM, 250nM, 500nM, 1uM; MGCD0103: 
25nM, 50nM, 100nM, 250nM, 500nM, 1uM; RGFP996: 250nM, 500nM, 1uM, 2.5uM, 
5.0uM and 10uM; Tubastatin A: 250nM, 500nM, 1uM, 2.5uM, 5.0uM and 10uM; MS-275: 
125nM, 250nM, 500nM, 1uM, 2.5uM. Treatments were applied for a period of 5 days, 
afterwhich, MTS colorimetric assay (promega) was conducted. MTS reagent was diluted 
20uL per mL in complete media and vortexed to ensure the resultant solution was 
homogeneous. Drug treated media was gently removed from treated cells by multichannel 
pipette and replaced with MTS supplemented media. Cells were incubated in 37C incubator 
to allow the colorimetric reaction to occur. After incubation 490nm absorbance was read 
using the BioRad iMark microplate reader for media+MTS, vehicle treated+MTS and drug 
treated+MTS cells. Absorbance values were imported to Graphpad prism. Data were 
normalized and drug doses were log transformed. These normalized, log transformed data 
were analyzed by 4 parameter nonlinear regression to generate log dose response curves for 
each cell line and drug condition and determination of drug effect at dose. The resultant dose 
response curves are a representation of these data, with the indicated biological replicates 
being a representation of the mean for each condition. These dose response data were 
utilized for drug synergy analysis (Compusyn). The fractional effect data for each drug 
condition were imported for the inhibitors deployed both alone and in combination with 
Aza. These data were analyzed and used to generate combination index output as an 
indicator of drug synergy.
BrdU Cell Proliferation Assay, colorimetric ELISA—Cells were plated in technical 
triplicate in 96 well format at the densities described in the Cell viability section. Vehicle or 
Aza treated cells were allowed to adhere for 24 hr prior to the onset of treatment. Cell were 
subsequently treated with the following inhibitors for 3 days. MGCD0103: 200nM, 
ITF-2357: 100nM, Tubastatin A: 1uM, RGFP996: 2uM. On day 3 of treatment, Stock Brdu 
(Calbiochem BrdU Cell Proliferation Assay) was diluted 1:1000 in complete media and 
added to 100uL of drug treated media. Cells were incubated with BrdU at 37C for 5 hours to 
allow for DNA synthesis based incorporation. The remainder of protocol was carried out as 
described in Calbiochem protocol, with the lot specific 1:2400 dilution of secondary 
antibody. 450nm absorbance values derived from ELISA were measured using the Biorad 
iMark plate reader. The triplicate measurements per condition were imported to graphpad 
prism and the data background subtracted, normalized to vehicle treated controls to generate 
the normalized proliferation. Error bars depicted as SEM between the means of experimental 
replicates. Statistical significance is the result of two way t test conducted between the 
experimental conditions depicted.

 Gene expression analysis by microarray—RNA expression analyses were conducted 
by microarray for the conditions described in the relevant figures. The R/Bioconductor 
package limma was used to process expression data. Within- and between-array 
normalizations were performed using the loess and aquantile methods, respectively. The 
normexp option was used for background correction. Raw files read in using the 
read.maimages function. Log2 fold change in transcription for drug treated conditions over 
mock treated was obtained for each sample at each time point studied. Ranked lists of log2 
fold change were analyzed using Gene Set Enrichment Analysis (GSEA) by the Broad 
Institute and data packages (Subramanian et al., 2005). Pathways enriched with a false 
discovery rate less than 0.25 were selected with cutoff of 2.0 normalized enrichment score in 
human and 1.5 normalized enrichment score cutoff in mouse studies. Median absolute 
deviation analysis of Log2 fold change transcription data were obtained using Morpheus 
program (Broad). Top 500 genes were selected and depicted as heatmap representative of 
minimum to maximum value ranking for each gene across cell lines and conditions.
DAVID analysis of median absolute deviation derived genes (KEGG Pathways)
—Top 500 genes derived by median absolute deviation analysis were obtained as described 
in Gene expression by microarray methods section and were analyzed for KEGG Gene 
Ontology (GO) enrichment using the DAVID Bioinformatics resources database (Huang da 
et al., 2009a, 2009b). Only categories that were below the DAVID p value of 0.05, and 
containing at least 5 genes per pathway are reported.
MYC targets heatmap—MYC targets heatmaps are based on hierarchical clustering of 
Log2 fold change over mock using Euclidean distance and complete linkage of MYC 
hallmarks gene set v2.
ERV absolute quantitative real time PCR (qPCR)—Eleven codogenic and partially 
codogenic ERV envelope (env) gene families (see Figure 3 and Figure S4 for ERV env genes 
used in this investigation), one ERV gag (ERV-W5) and two ERV pols (ERVFXA34, erv9-1) 
were quantified using qPCR and have been previously described (Chiappinelli et al., 2015). 
Additionally, some of these ERV primers could potentially hybridize with other ERV 
transcripts among the ERV family members, e.g., the ERV-K env primers could hybridize 
with 8 transcripts derived from ERV-K102 (1q22), −107 (5q33.3), −108 (7p22.1), −109 
(6q14.1), −113 (19p13.11), −115 (8p23.1), −17833 (19q12), −74261 (12q14.1) according to 
sequence alignments (Chiappinelli et al., 2015).
The qPCR methodology detecting the ERV genes has been previously described 
(Chiappinelli et al., 2015). Briefly, ERV genes were amplified by qPCR from 40 ng of cell 
line cDNA with SYBR-green technology and then analyzed with an ABI7300 (ABI, 
Darmstadt, Germany). Expression values were calculated as molecules per ng total RNA 
using a standard curve of each cloned gene determined by real time PCR and calculated as 
mean ± SEM. TBP and beta-actin were used as housekeeping genes where a mean from both 
genes was used for normalization of NSCLC cell lines.
IFNα/β qPCR—qPCR methodology for detecting IFNα/β related genes (ISG15, OASL, 
HLA-A, HLA-B) differential expression was conducted on 20ng of cell line cDNA with

 SYBR green technology. Expression values were calculated as fold change over mock by 
delta-delta ct. Beta-actin was used as housekeeping gene for normalization of NSCLC cell 
line expression.
Taqman microfluidic genecard—1ug of total RNA was used for cDNA reaction and 
diluted to 50uL total volume in molecular grade water. Diluted cDNA was combined with 
50uL of Taqman universal PCR mastermix and loaded onto a Taqman microfluidic genecard 
with the following primer/probe sets preloaded: IRF7, IFI27, STAT1, IFNB1, MX1, OASL, 
IFI6, beta actin, TBP. Expression values were calculated as fold change over mock by delta-
delta ct. Beta actin and TBP were used as housekeeping genes for normalization of NSCLC 
cell line expression.
ERV Overexpression and OASL qPCR—Syncytin-1, ERV-3, and empty vectors were 
transfected using standard lipofectamine 2000 methods. Vectors for ERV overexpression 
assay are described in Chiappinelli et al., 2015. Four days post transfection of either empty 
or indicated ERV vector assessment of OASL and ERV3 or Syn1 RNA transcription by 
qPCR was conducted.
Immunoblotting—Protein was extracted by 4% SDS mediated lysis, followed by 
processing of lysates through homogenizer column (Omega). Protein concentrations were 
estimated by BCA (Pierce Biotechnology). Lysates were processed using PAGE with 4%–
12% Bis-Tris BOLT gel (Life Technologies) and transferred to PVDF membrane 
(Millipore). Membranes were blocked in 10% milk/TBST and immunoblotted with the 
following antibodies.: rabbit monoclonal c-MYC (Cell Signaling, 1:1000), Rabbit 
monoclonal anti-Acetyl α Tubulin (Cell Signaling, 1:1000), Rabbit monoclonal anti-
Acetylated Histone 3 (Cell Signaling, 1:1000), Rabbit polyclonal anti-Histone H3 (Cell 
Signaling, 1:1000), Rabbit polyclonal anti-DNMT1 (Sigma Aldrich, 1:2000), Mouse 
monoclonal anti-β-Actin (Sigma Aldrich, 1:10000). The loading control antibodies (anti-β-
Actin, anti-Histone H3) in all cases were applied after membrane stripping.
DNMT1 Knockdown Cell Viability Assay—DNMT1 knockdown was initiated see 
reference for sequence (Cai et al., 2017) and control vector shGFP 5′-GCAAGCTGACCCT 
GAAGTTCAT3-3′. Clonal selection was initiated with puromycin selection. Selected clones 
were plated at cell densities, treated and analyzed as described in Cell viability Assay 
section of methods. Error bars are representative of mean ± SEM between experimental 
replicates.
MYC Knockdown Cell Viability Assay—MYC knockdown was initiated using Broad 
TRCN0000010391 clone and control vector shGFP 5′-GCAAGCTGACCCTGAAGTT 
CAT3-3′. Clonal selection was initiated with puromycin selection. Selected clones were 
plated at the cell densities and treated as described in Cell viability assay section of methods. 
MTS was used to quantify numbers of proliferating cells. Bar graphs depicted are 
representative of the percent of MYC knockdown cells present as a percentage of the empty 
vector treated controls for same dose of drug. Error bars are representative of mean ± SEM 
between experimental replicates. Statistical significance was determined by two tailed t test 
between empty vector and MYC shRNA treated cells at each dose.

 MYC Overexpression Cell Viability Assay—MYC vector (Addgene plasmid # 46970) 
(Cheng et al., 2013) and empty vector (Clontech cat# 632154). Clonal selection was initiated 
with puromycin, 2 days post infection. Selected clones were plated at cell densities and 
treated as described in Cell viability assay section of methods. MTS was used to quantify 
numbers of proliferating cells. Bar graphs depicted are representative of the percent of MYC 
overexpression cells present as a percentage of the empty vector treated controls for same 
dose of drug. Error bars are representative of mean ± SEM between experimental replicates. 
Statistical significance was determined by two tailed t test between empty vector and MYC 
overexpression vector treated cells at each dose.
In-vivo Drug Studies—Mice were treated as follows: Azacitidine 0.5 mg/kg (PBS 
vehicle) IP injected daily for the first 5 days of every 14 day treatment cycle. In vivo HDACi 
was applied on day 7 of 14 day treatment cycle and injected daily for 5 days of 14 day cycle. 
ITF-2357 2.0 mg/kg (1% DMSO in PBS vehicle) IP injected daily for 5 days sequentially, 
every 14 days. MS-275 2.0 mg/kg (1% DMSO in PBS vehicle) IP injected daily for 5 days 
sequentially, every 14 days. MGCD0103 4.0 mg/kg (5% DMSO in PBS vehicle) IP injected 
daily for 5 days sequentially, every 14 days. InVivoMAb mouse Anti-PD1 (BioXcell RMPI 
14 clone) injected 10ug/kg on the 12th day of a 14 day cycle. InVivoMAb Rat IgG2a Isotype 
control (BioXcell 2A3 clone) injected 10ug/kg on the 12th day of a 14 day cycle. CD8a 
depletion antibody (BioXcell, 2.43 clone), 3 times per week at 150ug per animal, see LLC 
CD8 depletion model for details about the treatment schema. For xenograft studies, 
treatment was initiated when palpable tumors could be discerned and continued for the 
duration of study. For Kras G12D mouse model studies, drug application initiated 16 weeks 
post Ad-Cre instillation, and applied for 12 weeks as described in the Kras G12D animal 
model section. For LLC model treatment was initiated 7 days after subcutaneous implant of 
flank tumor and mice were treated as described in (Figure S6A). Mice were injected IP with 
150ug of CD8a antibody (BioXcell), three times per week throughout the duration of study. 
CD8 depletion was verified by assessment of CD8% of CD45 population in the spleen of 
depleted sample versus control samples.
Assessment of lung tumor formation—Mice were sacrificed and the left lung was 
fixed in formalin for histologic examination. The right lung in some mice were lavaged by 
instilling with 1.0ml of sterile PBS to collect Bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL) fluid. In some 
mice right lung was used to macro dissect tumors for RNA extraction.
Bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL) fluid cytokine analysis—1.0 mL of BAL fluid was 
instilled into the right lung of tumor bearing KrasG12D mice. 50uL of this BAL was utilized 
for cytokine analysis as described by the manufacturer (Raybiotech, QAM-CYT-1). 
Cytokine array was scanned by the manufacturer. Cytokine quantification was conducted 
using a standard curve of each cytokine present at known concentrations supplied by the 
manufacturer. p values for cytokine data were derived using Graphpad Prism software and 
were defined as < 0.05 by unpaired two tailed t test when comparing treated condition versus 
control, biological replicates were used for the derivation of significance. Data are mean ± 
SD between biological replicates.

 Histological analysis of mouse tissues—Lungs tissues were fixed in 10% formalin 
overnight, and subsequently transferred into 70% ethanol, embedded in paraffin and 
sectioned (5 μM) at 3 levels at regular intervals. Sections were stained with Hematoxylin and 
eosin (H&E) and scanned using the Aperio whole slide scanning system (Scanscope CS) 
The entire left lung lobe was scanned for presence of adenomas/adenocarcinomas using the 
Aperio ImageScope analysis software. For each sample, sections from 3 levels were 
analyzed. Unstained sections of the left lung were also used for Immunohistochemistry 
(IHC) staining. All Images were scanned at 20x magnification using the Aperio Scanscope 
system.
Immunohistochemistry (IHC)—Immunostaining of lung sections was performed with 
the PowerVision kit according to the manufacturer’s protocol (Leica Bio-systems). Briefly, 
slides were heated at 60°C for 10 min,deparaffinized and hydrated through xylene, graded 
ethyl alcohols, dH2O, dH2O with 20% Tween 20 (P-7949, Sigma-Aldrich). After antigen 
retrieval (45 minutes of steaming in Target Retrieval Solution (Dako S170084-2) using 
Black and Decker Handy Steamer Plus), sections were treated 5 minutes with Dual 
Endogenous Enzyme Block (S2003, Dako). Sections with primary antibodies Ki67 (Cell 
signaling, 9101, 1:500) were incubated at room temperature for 45 minutes. Additional 
blocking steps were used for CD8 and F4/80 slides using DakoCytomation Biotin Blocking 
System (X0590). Antibody incubations for CD8 (eBiosciences, 14-0808, 1:800) and F4/80 
(Serotec, MCAP497, 1:1000) were carried out at room temperature for 45 minutes, soaked 
an additional 45 min in PBS-Tween, and followed by mouse adsorbed biotinylated anti Rat 
IgG (Vector, BA-4001, 1:500) for 15 minutes. For all, the secondary used was anti-rabbit 
IgG-reagent provided in the Powervision kit (PV6119, Leica Biosystems) for 30 minutes. 
Immunostaining was visualized with DAB chromogen (D4293, Sigma-Aldrich) and sections 
were counterstained with Mayer’s hematoxylin. Control slides: No primary for each, CD8 
(spleen), F480 (tumor)
F4/80 Intratumor Macrophage Analysis—F4/80 IHC stained sections were scanned 
used the Aperio system as described earlier, these images were analyzed using image-scope 
software. To generate the false color images depicted used to demarcate pixel saturation by 
macrophage infiltration, the images were analyzed by the positive pixel v4 algorythm.
Isolation of murine bone marrow derive macrophages (BMDMs)—Mice (6–8) 
week old were euthanized and hind legs were harvested under aseptic conditions. Femurs 
and tibia were obtained and flushed with RPMI medium. Cells were then centrifuged and 
treated with ACK buffer to lyse RBC’s. Cell pellets were then washed with and resuspended 
in RPMI medium and plated in six well plates in the presence of M-CSF. Medium was 
changed every 2 days. Treatments with Aza and HDACi were started after 4 days and the in 
vitro drug treatment schema was 5 days of 500nM Aza followed by either vehicle or 100 nM 
ITF-2357 for 5 days. Cells were then collected and RNA extracted.
TCGA Analysis—Broad Morpheus tool was used to analyze TCGA LUAD data for the 
relationship between CCL5 and MYC. First the 2 genes were selected from available RNA 
seq data of 576 patients available. These data were used to generate a new heatmap. This

 new heatmap was sorted based on CCL5 and MYC expression and the samples were 
separated into low, intermediate and high expression groups. These subsets were than 
compared using the profile interaction tool to generate the depicted plots. 576 LUAD 
samples were ranked by expression of CCL5 and MYC into: low, intermediate and high 
expression groups. These 3 expression categories for MYC and CCL5 were then compared 
as follows on the y axis, where gene(y) is sorted based on low, intermediate or high 
expression of other gene: MYC high:CCL5(y), MYCintermediate:CCL5(y), 
MYClow:CCL5(y), MYC(y):CCL5high, MYC(y):CCL5intermediate, MYC(y):CCL5low.
Patient and sample characteristics used for MYC amplification studies—The 
studies were conducted in accordance with the Declaration of Helsinki and were approved 
by the Institutional Review Board (IRB), and patients provided written informed consent for 
sample acquisition for research purposes. We analyzed pre-treatment exome data derived 
from a recently published set of NSCLC patients treated with immune checkpoint blockade 
(Anagnostou et al., 2017). Patient and sample characteristics as well as treatment and 
response assessments are described in detail elsewhere (Anagnostou et al., 2017). In brief, 
our study group consisted of two NSCLC patients treated with PD-1 blockade (CGLU117T1 
and CGLU127T1) and two NSCLC patients treated with combined PD-1 and CTLA4 
blockade (CGLU116T1 and CGLU161T1). All patients achieved a partial response of more 
than six months in duration (durable clinical benefit-DCB) apart from CGLU117T1, who 
achieved stable disease (22% tumor regression by RECIST 1.1) of 4 months duration before 
he developed disease progression (non-durable clinical benefit-NCB). An additional NSCLC 
tumor sample from a patient with sustained response to PD-1 blockade was obtained for 
comparative analysis of CD8+ T-cell density.
Somatic Copy Number Analysis—Whole exome sequence data from a previously 
published cohort of four patients with NSCLC (Anagnostou et al., 2017) was evaluated to 
determine the somatic copy number of MYC locus in pre-treatment tumor samples. The 
sequencing depth of coverage of the tumor sample in bins spanning coding and non-coding 
regions of the genome were compared to the matched normal sample from each patient. The 
log2 read ratio values were corrected for biases resulting from the exome capture process 
and sequence composition using CNVKit (0.7.6) (Talevich et al., 2016), and were adjusted 
to account for variable normal cell contamination as previously described (Anagnostou et 
al., 2017).
FACS sorting and profiling of macrophages and T cells LSL-KrasG12D—For 
FACS sorting of macrophages and CD8 T cells from LSL-KRasG12D mice, lungs were 
harvested from mock or treated mice following three months of treatment. Tissue was then 
digested for 30 minutes at 37°C in digestion buffer (RPMI, FBS (10%), Collagenase Type 1 
(0.2%), Collagenase Type 2 (0.2%) and DNase I (50u/mL). Tissue was then minced and 
strained through a 40um cell strainer to obtain a single cell suspension. RBC’s were then 
lysed with ACK buffer and the cell pellet was washed twice in RPMI prior to suspension in 
RPMI medium. Cells were then counted and blocked with Rat monoclonal anti-CD16/CD32 
(Fc block Antibody) in PBS for 30 min at 4°C. Cells were then stained with antibodies 
against CD45, Cd11b and F4/80 for macrophages or CD45, CD3, CD8a for CD8+ T cells.

 Propidium Iodide was used as a viability marker (5uL/100uL total volume). Cells were 
sorted and pellets were lysed and RNA extracted using RNeasy kit. RNA was then 
quantitated and amplified using the Sigma Whole Transcriptome Amplification kit. 
Amplified RNA was then processed and analyzed on Mouse Agilent 4×44 single color 
microarray. Post sort purity checks were utilized and the sorted populations were determined 
to be more than 95% pure population.
FACS profiling T cells LLC—For FACS profiling of CD8+ T cells from LLC mice, 
primary tumors were harvested from mock or treated mice following one month of 
treatment. Tissue was then digested using a mixture of collagenase, hyaluronidase and 
DNase. The resulting single cell suspension was counted and plated in complete media 
(RPMI+10% FBS) with or without eBiosciences stimulation cocktail (1:1000) for 4 hours. 
Cells were then collected and blocked with Rat monoclonal anti-CD16/CD32 (Fc block 
Antibody) in PBS for 30 min at 4°C. Cells were then stained with antibodies against Live/
dead, CD45, CD3, CD8a, and IFNγ for CD8+ T cells. Cells were then profiled by FACS.

 differentially expressed (microarray, n = 2 per group). Hypoxia- and angiogenic pathway-
associated genes are highlighted.
(C) Key affected pathways obtained from GSEA of CD45+CD11b+F4/80hi macrophage 
RNA isolated from tumor-bearing lungs from 3-month Aza + ITF-2357-treated LSL-
KrasG12D mice as compared to mock-treated mice.
(D) Log2 fold relative RNA probe distribution showing differential gene expression from 
bone marrow-derived macrophages (BMDMs) treated in vitro with mock or Aza + 
ITF-2357. Angiogenic pathway-associated genes are highlighted (microarray, BMDM data 
representative of n = 3 mice).
(E) GSEA enrichment plot for angiogenesis pathway from BMDM RNA expression.
(F) CD8+ IHC in lung tumors of mock- and Aza + ITF-2357-treated LSL-KrasG12D mice 
following 3 months of treatment (scale bar, 100 μm). The graph on the right indicates the 
average number of CD8+ T cells counted per field of view (FOV) intra-tumor for mock and 
treated mice (n = 6 mock and n = 7 Aza + ITF-2357 mice).
(G) Relative RNA expression-based enrichment plot for hallmark interferon gamma 
response gene set in tumors from LSL-KrasG12D mice treated with mock and Aza + 
ITF-2357. Color gradation is representative of Log2 fold change over mock RNA expression 
(microarray, n = 2 per group).
(H) Percentage IFNγ+ CD8+/CD3+ TILs by FACS in LLC subcutaneous tumors from 1-
month mock- and Aza + ITF-2357-treated mice.
(I) Volcano plot of relative RNA expression for CD45+CD3+CD8+ FACS-obtained 
lymphocytes isolated from tumor-bearing lungs of 3-month Aza + ITF-2357-treated LSL-
KrasG12D mice as compared to mock mice. Genes in the upper left and right quadrants are 
significantly differentially expressed (microarray, n = 2 per group). Highlighted genes are 
involved in T cell fate determination.
(J and K) Fold change in expression of selected differentially expressed genes in FACS-
obtained T cells from 3-month Aza + ITF-2357-treated mice. Genes shown are those that 
overlapped with exhaustion versus memory signatures (J) or exhaustion versus effector 
signatures (K) queried from Wherry et al. (2007) as defined in the Results. Genes on the left 
of each panel were differentially expressed by Aza + ITF-2357 and directionality in the gene 
set queried is on the right (red, upregulated; and blue, downregulated. The associated p value 
for the probability of overlap as derived by hypergeometric probability calculation is 
depicted above each panel. See also Figure S6.

Epigenetic Treatment
(A) Weights of subcutaneous LLC tumors from 1-month mock and Aza + ITF-2357 treated 
mice in the presence of CD8a-depleting antibody (n = 7 mock and n = 5 treated mice). NS, 
non-significant p value calculated by two tail t test.
(B) Representative H&E-stained images of lung metastases from the above 1-month mock 
and Aza + ITF-2357 treated mice in the presence of CD8a-depleting antibody (n = 7 mock 
and n = 5 treated mice).
(C) Expression of ccl5 RNA in lung tumors from LSL-KrasG12D mice in response to 3 
months of treatment with mock or Aza + ITF-2357 (microarray, n = 2, p value < 0.05 
calculated by two-tailed t test).

 (D) Quantitation of ccl5 protein levels in bronchoalveolar lavage from LSL-KrasG12D mice 
treated with mock or Aza + ITF-2357 (n = 3; error bars, SD; *p value < 0.05 calculated by 
two-tailed t test).
(E) Relative fold change for CCL5 RNA expression in empty vector (EV) or MYC-
overexpressing A549 human NSCLC cells treated with 500 nM Aza and/or 100 nM 
ITF-2357 (qRT-PCR, day 8, n = 3). Data are presented as mean ± SEM (*p value < 0.05 
relative to EV and #p value < 0.05 relative to EV + Aza + ITF-2357, p values calculated by 
two-tailed t test).
(F) Profile interaction plots of TCGA RNA sequencing data for CCL5 and MYC expression 
across primary LUAD samples.
(G) Somatic copy number status of the MYC locus in NSCLC tumors. A 1.13-Mb segment 
overlapping MYC harbored a 12-fold amplification in CGLU117T1, the tumor that did not 
derive durable clinical benefit from immune checkpoint blockade. Orange lines represent 
segments of constant copy number. Circle and triangle markers indicate genomic bins in 
coding (target) and non-coding (off-target) regions, respectively.
(H) Copy number status of chromosome 8. The heatmap depicts segmental copy ratios after 
tumor purity correction, highlighting the amplification of the MYC locus for CGLU117T1 
(arrow), but not for the other tumors analyzed.
