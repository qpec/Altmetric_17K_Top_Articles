Background: Psoriasis is an immunodysregulatory inflammatory disease associated with comorbidities
affecting quality of life. With the advent of new treatments, there is growing need to assess the long-term
safety and efficacy of treatments in a real-world setting.
Objective: The objective of the Corrona Psoriasis Registry is to study the comparative safety and efficacy of
Food and Drug Administrationeapproved biologic treatments.
Methods: A cross-sectional study of patients enrolled in the registry, who initiated or switched to a
systemic therapy at enrollment or previous 12 months. Descriptive characteristics (demographics, clinical
and patient-reported outcomes, comorbidities, and treatment history) were examined at registry
enrollment.
Results: As of October 1, 2016, there were 1942 patients enrolled in the registry: 23% on apremilast, 4% on
other nonbiologic systemic medications, 25% on interleukin (IL) 17A inhibitors, 22% on an IL-12/23
inhibitor, and 26% on tumor necrosis factor inhibitors. Overall, mean disease duration was 15.6 years, and
40% had a concurrent psoriatic arthritis diagnosis. About 66% had [3% body surface area involvement and
49% had a moderate or severe Investigator Global Assessment.

 Limitations: Selection and channeling bias can result in potential confounding that needs to be addressed
in modeled analyses.
Conclusion: This disease-based registry cohort represents a population exposed to multiple therapies,
long disease duration, and multiple comorbidities and can be used to examine comparative safety and
efficacy of various therapies. ( J Am Acad Dermatol 2018;78:323-32.)

Psoriasis is an immuno-
dysregulatory inflammatory
disease with a prevalence of
approximately
3%
in
US
adults.1 Signs and symptoms
associated
with
the
skin
lesions of psoriasis have a
profound impact on phys-
ical, psychologic, and social
health.2 A number of serious
comorbidities are associated
with psoriasis, one of the
most common being psori-
atic arthritis. The PREPARE
study
found
that
30%
of
psoriasis patients attending dermatology clinics in
Europe and North America had psoriatic arthritis
(PsA) when assessed by a rheumatologist.3 Patients
with psoriasis have a higher prevalence of obesity,
alcohol
use,
and
smoking
compared
with
age-matched controls. Independent of these risk
factors, morbidity and mortality is increased in
patients with psoriasis due to a higher prevalence
of
myocardial
infarctions,
diabetes,
chronic
kidney disease, stroke, and metabolic syndrome,
particularly when psoriasis is severe.4-8
Dermatologists
and
their
psoriasis
patients
welcome the approval and availability of new
treatments, many of which display high efficacy,
but
the
arrival
of
these
medications
is
also
accompanied by questions about long-term safety
in the clinical setting. Clinical trials capture safety and
efficacy data within the limitation of a restricted
population and duration, but are unable to fully
characterize long-term safety profiles, particularly
regarding malignancies, cardiovascular events, and
serious infections. Postmarketing data on medication
safety provides important information for patients
and their treating physicians to better assess the risk
and benefits of therapies and, therefore, allows more
informed treatment decisions. Passive reporting
systems like the Food and Drug Administration
Adverse Event Reporting System have limitations
including underreporting and a lack of a comparator
group. Registries are an effective mechanism for
monitoring safety associated with drug exposure
because
they
efficiently
collect detailed information
on
specific
outcomes
of
interest
in
a
real-world
population, which includes
patients of various demo-
graphics (eg, age, comorbid-
ities, disease severity), who
are often excluded from clin-
ical
trials.
Pharmaceutical
companies sponsor phase 4
studies to monitor postmar-
keting drug safety, and more
recent
efforts
in
psoriasis
have even included compar-
ator cohorts.9 However, a need remains for a single
unified, observational registry to collect and analyze
longitudinal outcomes associated with psoriasis
therapies, comorbidities, and the natural course of
the disease.
Corrona, a real-world evidence company that
operates registries and provides data analytics,
developed the Corrona Psoriasis Registry in collab-
oration with the National Psoriasis Foundation
(NPF), a leading patient advocacy organization for
people with psoriasis and psoriatic arthritis, to
fulfill this need for a real-world, longitudinal,
disease-based registry database. The registry, like
all Corrona registries,10 applies a collaborative model
using a single protocol and questionnaires.
The objectives of the registry are to study the
comparative safety and effectiveness, epidemiology,
and
treatment
patterns
of
approved
systemic
psoriasis therapies in a cohort of patients in a
real-world
setting.
This
report
describes
the
population, stratified by the therapy use, at registry
enrollment.
METHODS
Registry design and study population
The Corrona Psoriasis Registry, an independent
prospective, multicenter, observational diseasee
based registry, was launched in April 2015, with a
target
enrollment
of [10,000
patients
and
a
minimum follow-up of 8 years. Treating providers
may enroll eligible adult patients ($18 years old)
CAPSULE SUMMARY
d Clinical trials capture short-term data but
do not provide observational,
longitudinal outcomes.
d The Corrona Psoriasis Registry includes a
large real-world population receiving
biologic therapy for psoriasis.
d The goal of the registry is to produce
real-world safety and efficacy data to
guide treatment.

 diagnosed with psoriasis by their dermatologist
who
have
initiated
an
eligible
medication
at
enrollment
(incident
user)
or
within
the
previous 12 months from the date of enrollment
(prevalent
user).
Eligible
medications
include
Food and Drug Administrationeapproved biologics
for
the
treatment
of
psoriasis
(adalimumab,
etanercept, infliximab, ustekinumab, secukinumab,
ixekizumab, brodalumab, guselkumab) and the
nonbiologic systemic medications methotrexate,
cyclosporine, and apremilast. A limited nonbiologic
systemic arm was created for the purpose of an
additional
comparator
cohort,
and
recruitment
goals for this cohort have been met. All treatment
decisions are the sole responsibility of the treating
practitioner.
In collaboration with its partner, the NPF, as of
March 31, 2017, Corrona has recruited a network of
106 private practice and academic dermatology sites
across 35 states in the United States, with 188
participating dermatologists (Fig 1). These numbers
are expected to continue to grow as additional sites
join the Corrona dermatology network. As of March
31, 2017, the registry had enrolled 2702 patients
with approximately 5301 patient visits and 1436
patient-years of follow-up. The Corrona Psoriasis
Registry was approved by both local and central
(IntegReview, Corrona-PSO-500) review boards at
participating sites. Sites are compensated for their
effort.
All
patients
provided
written,
informed
consent.
All patients enrolled in the registry through
October 1, 2016, were included in this analysis
and
stratified
by
therapy
use
at
enrollment:
apremilast; other nonbiologic systemic medications
(methotrexate,
cyclosporine);
tumor
necrosis
factor (TNF) inhibitors (etanercept, adalimumab,
infliximab); interleukin (IL) 17A inhibitors (secuki-
numab, ixekizumab); and the IL-12/23 inhibitor
(ustekinumab).
Data collection and assessments
The registry collects data from both patients and
their treating dermatologists at the enrollment visit
and
during
routine
clinical
visits
that
occur
approximately every 6 months (180 days from the
last registry visit with a minus 30-day window or
$150 days from the last eligible registry visit)
through provider and patient questionnaires. Data
collected
at
enrollment
include
demographics,
lifestyle factors, medical history, medication history,
clinical assessments, and patient-reported outcomes
(PROs). Data collected at each follow-up encounter
include adverse events, medication use, health care
resource utilization, clinical assessments, laboratory
and imaging results, and PROs. Details of serious
adverse events and events of special interest are
collected
along
with
supporting
documents
(eg, hospital records, laboratory results) as part of
established procedures for collection, validation,
and evaluation of a range of safety outcomes
associated with psoriasis therapies. Case adjudica-
tion of select adverse events is completed by teams
of trained, medically qualified reviewers, specific to
event type.
Demographics, clinical characteristics, and
PROs
The following patient characteristics are collected
at
both
enrollment
and
follow-up
visits:
demographics (age, gender, race, ethnicity, weight,
body
mass
index
[BMI],
insurance,
education,
work
status,
and
smoking);
presence
of
PsA;
disease duration; psoriasis morphology; history of
comorbidities (eg, cardiovascular disease, serious
infection, cancer, diabetes mellitus, depression/
anxiety); and prior treatment history (biologic and
nonbiologic systemics, topical therapies, light and
laser therapies). Clinical measures include body
surface area (BSA; 0%-100%) affected, worst BSA
ever (provider reported from the patient chart and
when available), Investigator Global Assessment
(IGA;
0-4),
and
Psoriasis
Area
and
Severity
Index (PASI, 0-72). Several PRO measures are
collected, including patient-reported pain, itch, and
fatigue on a Visual Analog Scale (VAS) of 0 to 100;
Work
Productivity
and
Activity
Impairment,
including all 4 domains (work hours missed or
absenteeism,
impairment
while
working
or
presenteeism,
overall
percent
of
work
hours
affected, daily activities impairment); overall health
status
measured
by

 Statistical analysis
All adult patients enrolled in the Corrona Psoriasis
Registry as of October 1, 2016, approximately
18 months since the launch of the registry, who
started the eligible therapy at enrollment (incident
user) or in the previous 12 months (prevalent user)
were included. Descriptive statistics on the overall
population
and
by
drug/drug
groups
were
examined.
The
population
was
stratified
and
described by use of the following treatments at
registry enrollment: apremilast; other nonbiologic
systemic (methotrexate, cyclosporine); TNF inhibi-
tors (etanercept, adalimumab, infliximab); IL-17A
inhibitors (secukinumab, ixekizumab); and the sole
IL-12/23 inhibitor, ustekinumab (Fig 2).
Categorical variables (eg, gender, race, BMI, comor-
bidities) were summarized using frequency counts and
percentages. Continuous variables (eg, age, clinical
and disease measures) were summarized by the
counts and mean (standard deviation). ANOVA and

 Chi-square tests of association were used to identify if
any
differences
were
present
among
all
the
therapy groups for the continuous and categorical
variables, respectively. Selected significant ANOVA and
Chi-square results were subject to post-hoc testing
(Bonferroni and Dunn tests for continuous and
categorical
variables,
respectively)
to
highlight
pairwise differences where significant P values are
presented in text. All analyses were performed using
STATA (StataCorp LP 2015, Stata Statistical Software:
Release 14, Version 2, College Station, TX) with
significance set at the P = .05 level.
RESULTS
Demographics and patient characteristics
A total of 1942 patients with psoriasis enrolled in
the Corrona Psoriasis Registry as of October 1, 2016,
including 446 (23%) patients on apremilast, 71 (4%)
patients on other nonbiologic systemics, 493 (25%)
patients on IL-17A inhibitors, 429 (22%) patients on
the IL-12/23 inhibitor, and 503 (26%) patients on TNF
inhibitors. Overall mean age for the cohort was
50.3 years, with slightly older patients enrolled in
the apremilast (P \ .05) and other nonbiologic
systemic groups compared with biologics. Overall,
mean BMI was 30.7, with 46% of the patients being
obese; differences were seen among the groups, with
highest percentage of obese patients in the IL-17A
inhibitor group (53%) and lowest in the apremilast
group
(39%).
Differences
were
also
seen
in
the proportion of patients on private and Medicare/
Medicaid insurance, with patients on apremilast less
likely to be on private insurance (P \ .001) and
significantly more likely to be on Medicare (P\.001)
or Medicaid (P \.01) when compared with patients
in the biologic groups (Table I).

 the IL-17A inhibitor group (18.9 years, P\.001) and
lowest in the other nonbiologic group (10.7 years).
Overall, 40% (n = 769) of the patients had a PsA
diagnosis (reported by the treating practitioner),
with a mean disease duration of 7.8 years.
Groups had comparable history of comorbidities
and cardiovascular risk factors; however, fewer
patients in the IL-12/23 and TNF inhibitor groups
(8% in each group, P \ .005) had a history of
cardiovascular disease compared with the other
treatment groups (all P \ .005) (Table II). Slightly
less than half of the cohort was biologic-naive
(n = 892, 46%), with the highest percentage in the
other nonbiologic group (75%) and lowest in the
IL-17A inhibitor group (12%, P \.0001).
Disease characteristics
Disease severity in the cohort was assessed
through BSA, PASI, and IGA. Mean IGA for the
overall cohort at enrollment was 2.2, with almost
half (49%) of the patients in the moderate or severe
IGA category (Table II with group-wise significance
testing). Overall mean BSA was 9.5%, with IL-17
inhibitor patients more likely to have higher BSA
(12.3%) at enrollment compared pairwise with the
other biologics and patients on apremilast (P \.05).
The mean score for worst BSA ever in the overall
cohort was 24.2%, with two-thirds of the patients in
the moderate or severe BSA category at enrollment,
with patients on IL-17 inhibitors having significantly
higher worst BSA ever (31.9%, P \.005) compared
pairwise with the other categories. Overall mean
PASI score at enrollment was 5.7, with 18% of the
patients with PASI [10; at enrollment, a higher
proportion of patients on IL-17A inhibitors had
PASI [10 (24%, P \ .05) compared pairwise
with the other categories (IL-12/23 inhibitor, 19%;
TNF
inhibitors,
17%;
apremilast,
11%;
other
nonbiologics,
14%)
(Table
II).
Overall
disease
severity (as measured by BSA, IGA, and PASI) was
higher in the incident users compared with the
prevalent users (P \.0001).
Patient-reported outcomes
Detailed PRO measures are presented in Table III.
Mean scores for overall patient fatigue and pain were
30.8 and 23.7, respectively, with comparable mean
scores across the drug groups (Table III). About 67%
of the cohort were currently employed, with mean
overall daily activities impairment of 18.8; all the
domains
of
Work
Productivity
and
Activity
Impairment were similar across the drug groups.
The mean score for overall health status measured by
EQ VAS was 72.8, and the mean score for DLQI was
6.7; almost half of the patients reported moderate,
very large, or extremely large effect on life as
measured by DLQI.
DISCUSSION
In
the
absence
of
psoriasis
registries,
rheumatology-specific biologic registries historically
have provided valuable insights that are indirectly
applicable to the treatment of psoriasis, including the
association between TNF inhibitors and serious
infections, the reduction in cardiovascular event
risk with TNF inhibitor treatment, and the outcomes
associated with switching from one biologic to
another.10-15 However, given the large number of

 differences (eg, disease pathophysiology, body
weight, age, gender, concomitant medication usage)
between psoriasis and rheumatoid arthritis patients,
psoriasis-specific clinical assessments and PROs in
an observational, longitudinal setting are still needed
for dermatologists to make informed treatment
decisions.
The
Corrona
Psoriasis
Registry
was
developed in response to this unmet need and
will collect many of the data elements that are
meaningful to the dermatology community.
Importantly,
registries
satisfy
the
need
for
postapproval
safety
surveillance.
The
Corrona
Psoriasis Registry data is currently being used to
support
postapproval
safety
commitments
for
the currently approved IL-17einhibitor biologics,
secukinumab,
ixekizumab,
and
brodalumab,
indicative of the
favorable
view this
type of
registry has with regulatory agencies. Corrona
will provide information to these agencies upon
request.

 This reflects how the design of postapproval
safety studies for biologic therapies has evolved
over the last decade from single-arm, open-label
clinical trials to registries with multiple comparator
cohorts, which help contextualize adverse event
incidence rates and provide an enriched research
environment for comparative analyses. A large
registry, not sponsored by a single pharmaceutical
company serves as a central, unbiased repository for
longitudinal follow-up data of multiple biologics.
Further, enrollment in a single registry facilitates
more efficient recruitment of many different types of
patients studied at common sites with standardized,
in-depth
reporting.
Long-term
follow-up
of
a
well-enrolled population captures not only adverse
events but also effects of therapy on disease severity,
comorbidities, natural course of disease, and work
productivity. Finally, patients switching from one
drug to another would contribute data relevant to the
incident user pool for new drugs while providing
valuable information on drug switching.
Due to broad inclusion criteria, the Corrona
Psoriasis
Registry
population
enrolled
to
date
demonstrates
differences
from
clinical
trial
populations. Notably, the registry’s prevalence of
psoriatic arthritis (;36%-40%) is higher than that
seen
in
clinical
trial
populations
(;30%).16,17
Further, Corrona patients tend to be older, have
lower disease severity, and are more likely to have
been previously treated with a biologic. These
differences are expected given that the registry
enrolls both incident and prevalent users (up to
12 months following drug initiation). Because the
average drug survival (time to discontinuation) for
biologics is \5 years, it is anticipated that baseline
data on more incident drug starts will be captured
during follow-up visits.18,19 Regarding patient age
and disease severity, the enrolled Corrona Registry
US population is comparable to other international
psoriasis registry populations, such as PSOLAR and
PsoBest.9,20 Currently, the nonbiologic cohort is still
relatively large compared with the biologic cohorts,
skewing the overall population to look relatively
bio-naive.
Admittedly, observational registries have limita-
tions.
First,
participation
by both
the treating
dermatologists
and
patients
is
voluntary,
and
therefore,
selection
bias
might
be
introduced.
Second, confounding is highly likely. Potential
confounders will be examined and considered in
future analyses.
Using the Corrona Rheumatoid Arthritis Registry
as a prototype, the Corrona Psoriasis Registry
expects to contribute meaningful outcomes research
on the safety and effectiveness of systemic psoriasis
treatments
(eg,
descriptive
studies
on
patient
profile, treatment patterns, association studies, safety
studies,
comparative
effectiveness
research).
A
collaborative
model
registry
provides
the
opportunity for hypotheses to be generated and
evaluated by multiple stakeholders, including the
Registry Scientific Advisory Committee, the NPF and
its
Medical
Board,
the
registry’s
sponsoring
companies, and participating investigators, all of
whom may engage in collaborative projects geared
toward enriching the psoriasis knowledge base.
