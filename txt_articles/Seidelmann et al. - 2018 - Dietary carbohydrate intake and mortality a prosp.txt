Summary
Background Low carbohydrate diets, which restrict carbohydrate in favour of increased protein or fat intake, or both, 
are a popular weight-loss strategy. However, the long-term effect of carbohydrate restriction on mortality is controversial 
and could depend on whether dietary carbohydrate is replaced by plant-based or animal-based fat and protein. 
We aimed to investigate the association between carbohydrate intake and mortality.
Methods We studied 15 428 adults aged 45–64 years, in four US communities, who completed a dietary questionnaire 
at enrolment in the Atherosclerosis Risk in Communities (ARIC) study (between 1987 and 1989), and who did not 
report extreme caloric intake (<600 kcal or >4200 kcal per day for men and <500 kcal or >3600 kcal per day for 
women). The primary outcome was all-cause mortality. We investigated the association between the percentage of 
energy from carbohydrate intake and all-cause mortality, accounting for possible non-linear relationships in this 
cohort. We further examined this association, combining ARIC data with data for carbohydrate intake reported from 
seven multinational prospective studies in a meta-analysis. Finally, we assessed whether the substitution of animal or 
plant sources of fat and protein for carbohydrate affected mortality.
Findings During a median follow-up of 25 years there were 6283 deaths in the ARIC cohort, and there were 
40 181 deaths across all cohort studies. In the ARIC cohort, after multivariable adjustment, there was a U-shaped 
association between the percentage of energy consumed from carbohydrate (mean 48·9%, SD 9·4) and mortality: 
a percentage of 50–55% energy from carbohydrate was associated with the lowest risk of mortality. In the meta-
analysis of all cohorts (432 179 participants), both low carbohydrate consumption (<40%) and high carbohydrate 
consumption (>70%) conferred greater mortality risk than did moderate intake, which was consistent with a U-shaped 
association (pooled hazard ratio 1·20, 95% CI 1·09–1·32 for low carbohydrate consumption; 1·23, 1·11–1·36 for high 
carbohydrate consumption). However, results varied by the source of macronutrients: mortality increased when 
carbohydrates were exchanged for animal-derived fat or protein (1·18, 1·08–1·29) and mortality decreased when the 
substitutions were plant-based (0·82, 0·78–0·87).
Interpretation Both high and low percentages of carbohydrate diets were associated with increased mortality, with 
minimal risk observed at 50–55% carbohydrate intake. Low carbohydrate dietary patterns favouring animal-derived 
protein and fat sources, from sources such as lamb, beef, pork, and chicken, were associated with higher mortality, 
whereas those that favoured plant-derived protein and fat intake, from sources such as vegetables, nuts, peanut butter, 
and whole-grain breads, were associated with lower mortality, suggesting that the source of food notably modifies the 
association between carbohydrate intake and mortality.

Introduction
Some dietary guidelines have focused on lowering 
saturated and trans fat but not total fat or overall 
macronutrient composition.1,2 Other guidelines continue 
to recommend lowering total fat (<30% of energy from 
fat) in exchange for higher carbohydrate intake.3 In 
practice, however, low carbohydrate diets that exchange 
carbohydrates for a greater intake of protein or fat have 
gained substantial popularity because of their ability to 
induce short-term weight loss,4–7 despite incomplete and 
conflicting data regarding their long-term effects on 
health outcomes.8–12 Results from meta-analyses that 
included several large cohort studies in North America 
and Europe have suggested an association between 
increased mortality and low carbohydrate intake.8–12 
However, the 2017 Prospective Urban Rural Epidemiology 
(PURE) study, of individuals from 18 countries across 
five continents (n=135 335, median follow up 7·4 years, 
5796 deaths), reported that high carbohydrate intake was 
associated with increased risk of mortality.13 These data 
were interpreted as being contrary to previous work in 
the field, prompting calls for revisions to current 
nutrition guidelines.13,14 It is important to note, however, 
that most studies have reported mortality risk based on

quantiles of carbohydrate intake that are specific to the 
populations studied. Thus, the effects of carbohydrate 
intake can depend on the internal reference range for a 
given population. Furthermore, most analyses of 
carbohydrate intake have not accounted for the potential 
effects of specific food sources (ie, animal-based versus 
plant-based) that are used to replace carbohydrate intake 
in low carbohydrate intake settings.
Given the need for more evidence to help guide 
recommendations regarding optimal carbohydrate intake, 
we did a population-based study of overall carbohydrate 
consumption, allowing for the possibility of non-linear 
relationships. Specifically, we investigated the association 
of carbohydrate intake with mortality and residual lifespan 
in a large bi-racial cohort of adults living in four US 
communities, and then combined these mortality data 
with previous data as part of a meta-analysis to 
contextualise our findings. We then studied whether the 
replacement of carbohydrate for animal-based or plant-
based sources of fat and protein modified any observed 
associations.
Methods
Study design and participants
The Atherosclerosis Risk in Communities (ARIC) 
study is an ongoing, prospective observational study of 
cardiovascular risk factors in four US communities 
(Forsyth County, NC; Jackson, MS; suburbs of 
Minneapolis, MN; and Washington County, MD), 
initially consisting of participants aged 45–64 years 
who were recruited between 1987 and 1989 (Visit 1).15 
Study participants were examined at follow-up visits, 
with the second visit occurring between 1990 and 1992, 
the third between 1993 and 1995, the fourth between 
1996 and 1998, the fifth between 2011 and 2013, and the 
sixth between 2016 and 2017
. At each participating site, 
an institutional review board approved the study 
protocol. Participants provided written informed 
consent at each examination. We excluded participants 
without complete dietary information or with extreme 
caloric intake (defined as <600 kcal or >4200 kcal 
per day for men and <500 kcal or >3600 kcal per day for 
women).
Research in context
Evidence before this study
Although many randomised controlled trials of low 
carbohydrate diets suggest beneficial short-term weight loss 
and improvements in cardiometabolic risk, mortality risk has 
typically not been investigated in light of the practical 
challenges posed by studies involving very long durations of 
follow-up. Data from large prospective cohorts have been used 
to estimate the long-term health effects of low carbohydrate 
diets, but have generated conflicting results. For instance, the 
meta-analysis of large cohort studies in North America and 
Europe has suggested increased mortality associated with low 
carbohydrate intake. Conversely, recently published 
multinational and Asian studies have reported increased 
mortality in association with high carbohydrate intake. Most 
previous studies have reported the risk of mortality on the basis 
of the range of carbohydrate intake specific to the population 
studied, thus limiting both interpretability and generalisability. 
Furthermore, many previous studies of carbohydrate intake 
have not accounted for the potential effects of food source. We 
updated a previously published meta-analysis by searching 
MEDLINE, Embase, ISI Web of Science, Cochrane Library, and 
ClinicalTrials.gov, using a combination of the keywords “low-
carbohydrate diet” OR “carbohydrate-restricted diet”, AND 
“mortality” OR “survival”, to identify relevant publications 
published between Sept 12, 2012, and Sept 1, 2017.
Added value of this study
We studied a large prospective cohort, with a median follow-up 
of 25 years, to examine the association of carbohydrate intake 
with mortality in four US communities from diverse 
socioeconomic backgrounds. We used statistical methods that 
allowed for the possibility of non-linear associations. We then 
contextualised our findings in a meta-analysis, combining these 
data with those from other North American, European, Asian 
and multinational cohorts. We identified seven studies in 
addition to the index cohort (432 179 participants, 
40 181 deaths). There was a U-shaped relationship between 
carbohydrate intake and mortality in the Atherosclerosis Risk in 
Communities cohort, a finding that was consistent in the 
meta-analysis combining these data with those from the other 
cohorts. When assessing total carbohydrate without regard to 
specific food source, diets with high (>70%) or low (<40%) 
percentage of energy from carbohydrates were associated with 
increased mortality, with minimal risk observed between 
50–55%. Low carbohydrate dietary patterns that replaced 
carbohydrate with animal-derived protein or fat were associated 
with greater mortality risk, whereas this association was inverse 
when energy from carbohydrate was replaced with 
plant-derived protein or fat. These findings were also 
corroborated in the meta-analysis.
Implications of all the available evidence
Our findings suggest a U-shaped relationship between life 
expectancy and overall carbohydrate intake, in which lifespan is 
greatest among people with 50–55% carbohydrate intake, 
a level that might be considered moderate in North America 
and Europe but low in other regions, such as Asia. These data 
provide further evidence that animal-based low carbohydrate 
diets, which are more prevalent in North American and 
European populations, should be discouraged. Alternatively, 
if restricting carbohydrate intake is a chosen approach for 
weight loss or cardiometabolic risk reduction, replacement of 
carbohydrates with predominantly plant-based fats and 
proteins could be considered as a long-term approach to 
promote healthy ageing.

Procedures
Participants completed an interview that included a 
66-item semi-quantitative food frequency questionnaire 
(FFQ), modified from a 61-item FFQ designed and 
validated by Willett and colleagues,16 at Visit 1 (1987–89) 
and Visit 3 (1993–95). Participants reported the frequency 
with which they consumed particular foods and beverages 
in nine standard frequency categories (extending from 
never or less than one time per month, to six or more 
times per day). Standard portion sizes were provided as a 
reference for intake estimation, and pictures and food 
models were shown to the participants by the interviewer 
at each examination. We used the Harvard Nutrient 
Database to derive nutrient intakes from the FFQ 
responses.16
Outcomes
The primary outcome was all-cause mortality, subsequent 
to the first visit, until the end of 2013. Number of deaths 
was determined with annual (or later, semi-annual) 
telephone calls, linkage to local hospital and state health 
department records, or for those lost to follow-up, linkage 
to the National Death Index. 
Statistical analysis
We analysed the covariates of age, sex, race (self-
reported), study centre, education level (grade school, 
high school without diploma, high school graduate, 
vocational school, college graduate, graduate school or 
professional school), cigarette smoking status (current, 
former, never), physical activity level (sport and exercise 
activity and non-sport activity during leisure from Baecke 
questionnaire17), total energy intake (kcal), ARIC test 
centre location, and diabetes status (defined on the basis 
of use of anti-diabetic medications, self-report of a 
physician diagnosis, fasting glucose value ≥126 mg/dL or 
a non-fasting glucose of ≥200).
We tested the association of baseline characteristics of 
the ARIC cohort with quantiles of total energy from 
carbohydrate using linear regression and χ² tests for 
categorical variables (adjusting for age and sex). We used 
Cox proportional hazards regression models to calculate 
hazard ratios (HRs), to quantify the association between 
carbohydrate intake and the risk of death. We used 
restricted cubic splines18 with 4 knots to express the 
potentially non-linear association between total energy 
from carbohydrate intake at Visit 1 and all-cause mortality. 
We adjusted the ARIC analyses for demographics (age, 
sex, self-reported race), energy intake (kcal per day), study 
centre, education, exercise during leisure activity, income 
level, cigarette smoking, and diabetes. We did a time-
varying sensitivity analysis: between baseline ARIC Visit 1 
and Visit 3, carbohydrate intake was calculated on the 
basis of responses from the baseline FFQ. From Visit 3 
onwards, the cumulative average of carbohydrate intake 
was calculated on the basis of the mean of baseline and 
Visit 3 FFQ responses. We did not update carbohydrate 
exposures of participants that developed heart disease, 
diabetes, and stroke before Visit 3, to reduce potential 
confounding from changes in diet that could arise from 
the diagnosis of these diseases. We did a mean residual 
lifetime analysis using previously published methods.19 
We created actuarial estimates of the age-specific 
probabilities of death according to each category of 
carbohydrate intake exposure, and used these estimates 
to 
obtain 
non-parametric 
age-based 
Kaplan-Meier 
estimates of the survival curve for participants at each 
year of age in each carbohydrate intake category (>65%, 
55–65%, 50–55%, 40–50%, 30–40%, and <30%). The 
expected residual years of survival were estimated as the 
area under the survival curve up to a maximum age of 93 
years. We chose a reference group of 50–55% for the 
analysis and we did a post-hoc sensitivity analysis using a 
reference group of 50–60%. We updated the previously 
published meta-analysis (including papers published 
between Sept 12, 2012, when the previous meta-analysis 
ended, and Sept 1, 2017) using previously described 
methods.12 Briefly, papers were eligible for inclusion if 
they were a published full-text report, observational study, 
or randomised controlled trial with a minimum of 1 year 
follow-up, reporting relative risks (ie, HRs, risk ratios, or 
odds ratios with CIs), and adjusted for at least three of the 
following factors: age, sex, obesity, smoking status, 
diabetes, hypertension, hypercholesterolaemia, history of 
cardio-vascular 
disease, 
and 
family 
history 
of 
cardiovascular disease. We assessed the quality of reports 
in reference to the CONSORT statement20 and the 
STROBE statement.21 We further assessed quality using 
the Newcastle-Ottawa Scale,22 with a score of 5 or less 
(out of 8) suggesting a high risk of bias. If more than a 
single study published data from the same cohort with 
the same endpoint of all-cause mortality, we included the 
report representing the most inclusive information on 
the population to avoid overlap. We calculated pooled 
HRs with 95% CIs using a random-effects model with 
inverse-variance weighting. We recreated the mortality 
versus percentage of energy from carbohydrate spline 
from the PURE study13 by extracting published co-
ordinates; we overlaid ARIC data on the graph using an 
identical reference point of 46·4% kcal from carbohydrate, 
and closely matched the covariates available in the ARIC 
cohort with those used in the PURE study, including 
waist-to-hip ratio.
We created animal-based and plant-based scores by 
dividing participants into deciles for either animal-
derived or plant-derived fat and protein, and carbohydrate 
intake, expressed as a percentage of energy as previously 
described.23,24 For carbohydrate, participants in the lowest 
decile received 10 points, whereas participants in the 
highest decile received 1 point. The order was reversed 
for animal-derived or plant-derived fat and protein, so 
that the highest score represented low carbohydrate and 
high animal-derived or plant-derived fat and protein 
intake. We used restricted cubic splines to determine the

association of all-cause mortality with animal-based and 
plant-based scores. For meta-analysis of animal and 
plant-based scores, we calculated pooled HRs with 
95% CIs using a random-effects model with inverse-
variance weighting for those cohorts that had these data 
available.
In post-hoc sensitivity analyses, we explored the outcome 
of cardiovascular death (defined using International 
Classification of Diseases [ICD]-9 codes 390–459 and 
ICD-10 codes I00–I99).

Results
Baseline characteristics of the ARIC study population, 
according to quantiles of percentage energy from 
carbohydrate intake, are shown in table 1. Mean 
carbohydrate intake was 48·9% (SD 9·4). Participants 
who consumed a relatively low percentage of total energy 
from carbohydrates (ie, participants in the lowest 
quantiles) were more likely to be young, male, a self-
reported race other than black, college graduates, have 
high body-mass index, exercise less during leisure time, 
have high household income, smoke cigarettes, and have 
diabetes. Overall, mean consumption of energy from 
animal fat and protein was higher than from plant fat 
and protein across all carbohydrate quantiles (table 1). 
Participants in the lowest carbohydrate quantile had 
higher average consumption of animal fat and protein 
and lower average consumption of plant protein and 
dietary fibre than participants in the other quantiles. 
Plant fat and total energy intake had reverse U-shaped or 
J-shaped relationships across carbohydrate quantiles: 
participants in both the first and fifth quantile had lower 
mean plant-derived fats and calorie consumption 
compared with those in the intermediate quantiles 
(table 1). Prevalence of hypertension was similar across 
carbohydrate quantiles. There was no significant 
difference in weight gain at 3-year or 6-year timepoints 
across carbohydrate quantiles (table 1).
The median length of follow-up was 25 years, during 
which there were 6283 deaths. The highest risk of 
mortality was observed in participants with the lowest 
carbohydrate consumption, in both unadjusted and 
adjusted models (p<0·001; figure 1; appendix p 8). 
However, 
the 
relationship 
between 
carbohydrate 
consumption and risk of mortality was significantly non-
linear (p<0·001), resulting in a U-shaped association, 
with 
the 
lowest 
observed 
risk 
associated 
with 
carbohydrate consumption of 50–55% (figure 1). There 
were corresponding significant differences in mean 
residual lifespan based on carbohydrate intake (appendix 
p 2). For example, we estimated that a 50-year-old 
participant with intake of less than 30% of energy from 
carbohydrate would have a projected life expectancy of 
29·1 years, compared with 33·1 years for a participant 
who consumed 50–55% of energy from carbohydrate 
(difference 4·0 years [95% CI 2·6, 5·3]). Similarly, we 
estimated that a 50-year-old participant with high 
carbohydrate intake (>65% of energy from carbohydrate) 
would have a projected life expectancy of 32·0 years, 
compared with 33·1 years for a participant who 
consumed 50–55% of energy from carbohydrate 
(difference 1·1 years [0·1, 2·0]). We did a sensitivity 
analysis using 50–60% energy from carbohydrate as the 
comparison group, with similar findings (data not 
shown). The association of overall carbohydrate intake 
with cardiovascular and non-cardiovascular mortality is 
shown in the appendix (pp 3, 4). There were similar 
results when we used dietary information from Visit 1 
and Visit 3 in the sensitivity analysis (appendix pp 5, 6).
We updated a meta-analysis12 published in 2012, by 
identifying two additional studies that had since been 
published and that met inclusion criteria, using previously 
defined methods;13,24 we also added results from ARIC 
because they met previously defined inclusion criteria12 
(table 2). Including data from the ARIC cohort, there were 
432 179 participants in eight cohort studies investigating 
carbohydrate intake, with 40 181 (9·3%) deaths reported. 
Because there was significantly lower consumption of 
carbohydrate in European and North American regions 
compared with Asian countries, low-income countries, 
and multinational cohorts (p<0·001), studies fell into 
two categories in the meta-analysis: North American 
and European studies (mean carbohydrate intake 
approximately 50%) that compared low carbohydrate diets 
with primarily moderate carbohydrate consumption as 
the reference (figure 2A), and Asian and multinational 
studies (mean carbohydrate intake approximately 61%) 
that compared high carbohydrate consumption with 
moderate carbohydrate consumption as the reference 
(figure 2B; table 2). The association between carbohydrate 
consumption and mortality was dependent on the range 
of carbohydrate intake. Figure 2 illustrates the significantly 
increased risk of all-cause mortality among participants 
with low carbohydrate versus moderate carbohydrate 
consumption (pooled HR 1·20, 95% CI 1·09–1·32; 
p<0·0001). This relationship remained significant if the 
ARIC study was excluded from the analysis (1·31, 
1·07–1·58; p=0·007). High carbohydrate consumption 
was associated with a significantly higher risk of all-cause 
mortality 
compared 
with 
moderate 
carbohydrate 
consumption (1·23, 1·11–1·36; p<0·0001; figure 2).

continuous percentage of energy from carbohydrate. 
Figure 3 shows the overlapping and continuous 
relationship between percentage of energy from 
carbohydrate intake and mortality in these cohorts. By 
comparison with ARIC, the PURE study13 assessed 
participants primarily at the high end of the overall range 
of percentage of energy from carbohydrate consumption 
(figures 2, 3). However, the associations between 
primarily high carbohydrate intake and mortality in the 
PURE study still fell within the confidence intervals of 
those observed in ARIC (figure 3).
To explore the association between mortality and the 
source of fat and protein alternatives to carbohydrate 
intake, we compared studies that assessed animal-based 
and plant-based scores, which represented increasing 
substitution of animal-based or plant-based fat and 
protein for carbohydrate intake (table 2). Baseline 
characteristics of the ARIC study population, according 
to animal-based or plant-based low carbohydrate diet 
scores, are shown in the appendix (pp 9–11). The plant-
based low carbohydrate dietary score was associated with 
higher average intake of vegetables but lower fruit intake 
(appendix p 11). By contrast, the animal-based low 
carbohydrate dietary score was associated with lower 
average intake of both fruit and vegetables (appendix 
pp 9, 10). Both low carbohydrate diets were associated 
with higher fat intake in exchange for carbohydrate, 
although the plant-based low carbohydrate diet had 
higher average polyunsaturated fat and lower saturated 
fat intake compared with the animal-based low 
carbohydrate diet (appendix pp 9–11). Overall, total 
protein intake was higher in the animal-based diet 
(appendix p 9). We determined the five foods that differed 
most significantly between the highest and lowest 
quantiles 
of 
animal-based 
and 
plant-based 
low 
carbohydrate dietary score. The animal-based low 
carbohydrate diet had more servings per day than did 
higher carbohydrate diets of beef, pork, and lamb as the 
main dish; beef, pork, and lamb as a side dish; chicken 
with the skin on; chicken with the skin off; and cheese 
(appendix p 10). The plant-based low carbohydrate diet 
had more servings per day of nuts, peanut butter, dark or 
grain breads, chocolate, and white bread than did higher 
carbohydrate diets (appendix p 11). Both low carbohydrate 
diets were lower in average regular soft drink intake 
(appendix pp 10, 11). In the ARIC cohort and in meta-
analysis, increased consumption of animal-based protein 
and fat instead of carbohydrate was associated with a 
significant increase in all-cause mortality (p<0·0001; 
table 3). Alternatively, increased consumption of plant-
based protein and fat instead of carbohydrate was 
associated with a significant decrease in all-cause 
mortality (p<0·0001; table 3). The animal and plant-
based findings were consistent for cardiovascular and 
non-cardiovascular mortality (appendix pp 3, 4). 
Sensitivity analysis of plant-specific and animal-specific 
findings, using dietary information from Visit 1 and 
Visit 3, yielded similar results (appendix pp 6, 7). 
Similarly, in the meta-analysis, mortality increased when 
animal-derived fat and protein were substituted for

carbohydrate, and decreased when these substitutions 
were plant-based (table 3). In the post-hoc sensitivity 
analysis, we assessed all meta-analyses using a fixed-
effects model, with similar findings. Additionally, to 
minimise the likelihood of reverse causation, we did 
a sensitivity analysis whereby individuals with cardio-
vascular disease, diabetes, or cancer at baseline were 
excluded from the analyses. These post-hoc analyses also 
yielded similar results.
Discussion
In a large cohort of adults living in four diverse US 
communities, with more than two decades of follow-up, 
mid-life dietary patterns marked by both low carbohydrate 
(<40% of energy from carbohydrate) and high carbohydrate 
(>70% of energy from carbohydrate) consumption were 
associated with increased mortality risk and shorter 
residual lifespan, with minimum risk observed with 50–
55% of energy from carbohydrate. These findings reflect a 
U-shaped relationship between carbohydrate intake and 
mortality, and were corroborated by data from other North 
American, European, Asian and multinational cohorts, 
combined as part of a meta-analysis. However, low 
carbohydrate dietary patterns that replaced energy from 
carbohydrate with energy from animal-derived protein or 
fat were associated with greater risk. However, this 
association was reversed when energy from carbohydrate 
was replaced with plant-derived protein or fat.
In this study, the association of carbohydrate intake with 
mortality was dependent on the range of carbohydrate 
intake. The range of carbohydrate intake differs by 
geographical and socioeconomic factors; percentage of 
energy from carbohydrates have been lower in North 
American and European cohort studies (mean values 
generally ≤50%) than in Asian or multinational cohorts, 
which are largely comprised of low-income and middle-
income countries (mean values >60%). Overall, there was 
a U-shaped relationship between carbohydrate intake and 
mortality, but the North American and European cohorts 
primarily represented the left side of the U-shaped curve 
whereas Asian and less economically advanced nations (as 
included in the PURE study) represented the right side of 
the curve. North American and European cohort studies 
have compared true low carbohydrate dietary patterns (in 
terms of absolute value of <40% of total energy intake) 
and consistently found a modest yet significantly increased 
relative risk of all-cause death when compared with the 
highest quantile (generally still falling in a moderate 
carbohydrate range of 40–70%). The NIPPON DATA8024 
and PURE13 studies represent the right side of the curve 
for absolute intake of percentage of energy from 
carbohydrate, and consistently show a modest yet 
significantly decreased relative risk of all-cause death 
when comparing moderate (45–55% of total energy) to the 
highest quantile (>70% of total energy).
Findings from this study suggest that previous 
analyses of carbohydrate intake that focused on quantiles 
of consumption and then searched for a trend across 
those quantiles seem to have overlooked valuable 
information. Using the carbohydrate intake data 
continuously provides more granular information and 
allowed us to identify a more U-shaped relationship 
between carbohydrate consumption and risk, which 
might otherwise not have been evident. Continuous data 
have not been published for North American or 
European cohorts; several previous studies only showed 
a linear relationship,8,10,11 whereas others that reported 
quantiles were suggestive of U-shaped or J-shaped 
relationships.9,24 The relationship between dietary 
carbohydrate and mortality was reported as a continuous 
relationship in the PURE study, with intake ranging 
primarily from moderate to high carbohydrate, but still 
fell within the confidence intervals of what we observed 
in ARIC, with intake ranging primarily from low to 
moderate carbohydrate, further supporting a U-shaped 
relationship between carbohydrate intake and mortality. 
Although this study included quantile-based analyses to 
the extent that previous work has used such analyses, 
and we illustrate how the ARIC data fit in that context,

the continuous analyses probably reflect a much closer 
representation of the true relationship between 
carbohydrate intake and mortality.
To further examine the potential effects of protein 
and fat sources supplanting carbohydrate intake, we 
investigated animal-based and plant-based diets in the 
ARIC cohort. We found that low carbohydrate dietary 
patterns favouring animal-derived protein and fat sources 
were associated with higher mortality, in accordance with 
results from the Nurses’ Health Study and Health 
Professionals Follow up Study.9 However, low carbohydrate 
diets that favoured plant-derived protein and fat intake 
were associated with lower mortality, also consistent with 
previous results.9,24 These data suggest that the source of 
the protein and fat substituted for carbohydrates in the 
diet might notably modify the relationship between 
carbohydrate intake and mortality. Previous work has 
shown a less consistent relationship between overall 
carbohydrate intake and cardiovascular death by 
comparison with all-cause mortality.12 However, in our 
analysis, when carbohydrate is substituted for higher 
animal fat or protein intake it is associated with both 
higher cardiovascular and non-cardiovascular death, 
whereas plant-based substitutions are associated with 
both lower cardiovascular and non-cardiovascular death, 
indicating that food source could be an important 
consideration for both causes of mortality.
There are several possible explanations for our main 
findings. Low carbohydrate diets have tended to result in 
lower intake of vegetables, fruits, and grains and 
increased intakes of protein from animal sources,23,25–27 as 
observed in the ARIC cohort, which has been associated 
with higher mortality. It is likely that different amounts 
of bioactive dietary components in low carbohydrate 
versus balanced diets, such as branched-chain amino 
acids, fatty acids, fibre, phytochemicals, haem iron, and 
vitamins and minerals are involved.28 Long-term effects 
of a low carbohydrate diet with typically low plant and 
increased animal protein and fat consumption have been 
hypothesised to stimulate inflammatory pathways, 
biological ageing, and oxidative stress. On the other end 
of the spectrum, high carbohydrate diets, which are 
common in Asian and less economically advantaged 
nations, tend to be high in refined carbohydrates, such as 
white rice; these types of diets might reflect poor food 
quality13,24 and confer a chronically high glycaemic load 
that can lead to negative metabolic consequences.29
There are limitations to this study that merit 
consideration. This study represents observational data 
and is not a clinical trial; however, randomised trials of low 
carbohydrate diets on mortality are not practical because of 
the long duration of study required. Another limitation of 
this study is that diet was only assessed at two time 
intervals, spanning a 6-year period, and dietary patterns 
could change during 25 years. However, because 
participants are able to increase or decrease their 
consumption of carbohydrates during the course of follow-
up, any dietary changes that occur after the described 
assessments would be expected to attenuate any observed 
associations. Our conclusions about animal fat and protein 
might have less generalisability to Asian cultures, which 
often feature very high carbohydrate consumption but 
with a primary meat source that is often from fish. 
In fact, the plant score calculated in the Japanese cohort,

regions, and energy intake.13  The mean percentage of energy from carbohydrate in ARIC is 49%, and from PURE it is 
61%. ARIC=Atherosclerosis Risk in Communities. PURE=Prospective Urban Rural Epidemiology.

NIPPON DATA80,24 included fish as a source of protein as 
well. Hence, animal scores reported here are composed 
largely of beef, pork, and fowl, in addition to fish. An 
additional limitation is that the international data13 about 
very high carbohydrate intakes, largely derived from 
China, are, on average, higher than the national data,30 for 
unclear reasons. However, the advantage of these data is 
that they include multi-racial and ethnic groups across a 
spectrum of socioeconomic groups, and they are 
representative of many high quality cohorts. Given the 
relatively small number of individuals adhering to low 
carbohydrate diets with mainly plant-based protein and fat 
sources of macronutrients, this study could not definitively 
examine the relative benefits of this diet compared with 
other dietary patterns. Our study focused on general 
carbohydrate intake, which represents a heterogeneous 
group of dietary components. Any number and 
combination of dietary components could have been 
considered and adjusted for in this analysis; therefore, 
some confounders might have been unadjusted for. 
Ideally, it would be preferable to do an individual-level 
meta-analysis in a collaborative effort that would have 
allowed for consistent adjustment for confounders in 
pooled analysis. Finally, some degree of measurement 
error is unavoidable for all dietary assessment methods, 
and the absolute intakes need to be interpreted cautiously.
Our findings suggest a negative long-term association 
between life expectancy and both low carbohydrate and 
high carbohydrate diets when food sources are not taken 
into account. These data also provide further evidence 
that animal-based low carbohydrate diets should be 
discouraged. Alternatively, when restricting carbohydrate 
intake, replacement of carbohydrates with predominantly 
plant-based fats and proteins could be considered as a 
long-term approach to promote healthy ageing.
