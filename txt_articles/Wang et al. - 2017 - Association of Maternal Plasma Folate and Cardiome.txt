Since the late 1980s, the prevalence of childhood elevated 
blood pressure (BP) has increased in the United States, in 
particular among African Americans.1–3 This is of public 
health concern as childhood BP can predict BP values later 
in life, and individuals with higher BP are at greater risk of 
developing subclinical cardiovascular and metabolic dis-

BACKGROUND
The prevalence of childhood elevated blood pressure (BP) has increased 
in the United States, particularly among African Americans. The influ-
ence of maternal plasma folate levels, alone or in combination with 
maternal cardiometabolic risk factors (hypertensive disorders, diabe-
tes, and prepregnancy obesity), on child systolic BP (SBP) has not been 
examined in a prospective birth cohort. We hypothesize that adequate 
maternal folate levels can reduce the risk of elevated SBP in children 
born to mothers with cardiometabolic risk factors.
METHODS
This study included 1,290 mother–child dyads (875 African Americans 
(67.8%)) recruited at birth and followed prospectively up to age 9 years 
from 2003 to 2014 at the Boston Medical Center. Child SBP percentile 
was calculated according to US reference data and elevated SBP was 
defined as SBP ≥75th percentile.
RESULTS
Maternal folate levels, overall, were not associated with child SBP. 
However, we found a significant multiplicative interaction between 
maternal cardiometabolic risk factors and maternal folate lev-
els (Pinteraction = 0.015) on childhood elevated SBP. Among children 
born to mothers with any cardiometabolic risk factors, those whose 
mothers had folate levels above (vs. below) the median had 40% 
lower odds of elevated childhood SBP (odds ratio = 0.60, 95% con-
fidence interval: 0.40–0.90). The associations did not differ appreci-
ably in analyses restricted to African Americans, and they were not 
explained by gestational age, size at birth, prenatal folate intake, or 
breastfeeding.
CONCLUSIONS
Findings from our urban minority birth cohort suggest that higher lev-
els of maternal folate may help counteract the adverse associations of 
maternal cardiometabolic risk factors on child SBP.

Maternal Plasma Folate and Offspring Blood Pressure
early-life factors for the prevention of elevated childhood BP 
is an important public health objective.
There is growing evidence that maternal nutrition dur-
ing pregnancy, through its impact on the fetal intrauter-
ine environment, may influence offspring cardiometabolic 
health.5 Folate, which is involved in nucleic acid synthesis, 
DNA methylation, and cellular growth is particularly impor-
tant.6 Folate may have beneficial effects on BP by increasing 
nitric oxide synthesis in endothelial cells,7 or by reducing 
plasma homocysteine, which itself can cause endothelial 
cell injury.8 In young adults, higher folate intake has been 
associated with a lower incidence of hypertension later in 
life.9 Although studies in ewes have shown that a low dietary 
intake of folate and vitamin B12 around conception leads 
to offspring with altered DNA methylation and higher BP 
later in life,10 human observational studies focused on the 
association between maternal folate and offspring BP have 
been inconsistent.11,12 The reason for this may be due to 
differences in the method and period in which folate was 
assessed. Furthermore, no previous studies have examined 
the association of maternal folate status and child BP among 
mothers with cardiometabolic risk factors in pregnancy.
Maternal cardiometabolic risk factors during pregnancy, 
including hypertensive disorders, diabetes, and obesity have 
been associated with higher offspring systolic blood pressure 
(SBP).13–15 Abnormal maternal metabolic status may influ-
ence the cardiometabolic health of offspring through fetal 
programming.14 Maternal metabolic risk factors have also 
been linked to low blood folate levels.16 From this perspec-
tive, high maternal folate may confer greater protection for 
offspring development of elevated BP among mothers with 
cardiometabolic risk factors.
In the current study, we used data on plasma folate levels 
from a prospective US urban birth cohort, enriched by low-
income racial-and-ethnic minorities at high risk for elevated 
BP, to examine how maternal folate levels and cardiometa-
bolic risk factors individually and jointly affect offspring BP 
measured between 3 and 9 years of age.
METHODS
Study participants
This analysis included mother–infant pairs from the 
Boston Birth Cohort (BBC). The BBC was initiated in 
1998 with a rolling enrollment of mothers from the Boston 
Medical Center (BMC). This cohort comprises predomi-
nantly urban, low-income racial, and ethnic minority popu-
lation that has been described previously.17 At enrollment, 
within 2 to 3 days of delivery, a standardized questionnaire 
was used to assess maternal demographic and environmen-
tal information, including prepregnancy weight, height, 
race/ethnicity, education, smoking status, parity, perceived 
stress during pregnancy, and prenatal multivitamin intake. 
The research team also drew random blood from all mothers 
at enrollment.
Since 2003, all children who were enrolled in the BBC 
and planned to receive primary care at BMC were eligible 
for postnatal follow-up. A standardized questionnaire was 
used to assess postnatal demographic and environmental 
information. The research team drew random blood from 
children during first postnatal follow-up visit (the mean age 
at blood draw was 2.5 (SD = 2.1) years). The study protocol 
was approved by the Institutional Review Boards of BMC, 
Ann & Robert H. Lurie Children’s Hospital of Chicago, 
and Johns Hopkins Bloomberg School of Public Health. 
Written informed consent was obtained from all of the study 
mothers.
In Supplementary eFigure 1, we demonstrate how partici-
pants were selected for this analysis. Of the 7,939 mother–
child pairs enrolled in the BBC, 1,877 were followed from 
2003 to 2014 and completed at least 1 postnatal well-child 
visit with BP measurements at age 3 to 9 years at the BMC. 
The current analysis was further restricted to 1,290 mother–
child pairs who had complete data on prepregnancy body 
mass index (BMI), diabetes, hypertensive disorders in preg-
nancy, gestational age, birthweight, and maternal plasma 
folate levels. African Americans and mothers who did not 
smoke during pregnancy were more likely to be included, 
while other maternal demographic characteristics, birth 
outcomes, and maternal folate levels (included: (geometric 
mean = 29.5 nmol/l; 95% confidence interval: 28.6, 30.4) 
vs. excluded (geometric mean = 28.9 nmol/l; 95% confi-
dence interval: 28.0, 29.9) (P = 0.41).) were comparable 
between participants included and excluded from the study 
(Supplementary eTable 1).
Perinatal variables
Maternal prepregnancy weight and height were ascer-
tained by questionnaire within 2–3 days of delivery. 
Maternal BMI was calculated as weight in kilograms divided 
by height in meters squared (kg/m2), and then categorized 
into 3 groups: normal weight (18.5–24.9 kg/m2), overweight 
(25–29.9 kg/m2), and obesity (≥30 kg/m2). Underweight 
mothers (n = 44) were removed from the analysis due to a 
small sample size.
Maternal educational attainment was classified into high 
school and below vs. college and above. Maternal smok-
ing during pregnancy was classified into 3 groups: never 
smoker, intermittent, or continuous smoker.18 Maternal 
race/ethnicity was classified as Black, Hispanic, or other 
(which included White, Asian, Pacific Islander, and mothers 
who reported more than one race). Perceived stress during 
pregnancy was grouped into low vs. high.19 The frequency 
of maternal prenatal vitamin intake in the third trimester 
was classified as none or seldom (0–2/week) vs. often (≥3/
week). Information on infant feeding was obtained using a 
standardized postnatal follow-up questionnaire, and catego-
rized into 3 groups: (i) exclusively formula fed, (ii) exclu-
sively breast fed, or (iii) breast and formula fed.20 Maternal 
diabetes status was classified as nondiabetic or diabetic 
(either pre-existing or gestational diabetes).17 Maternal 
hypertensive disorders in pregnancy21 included pregnancy-
induced hypertension (i.e., gestational hypertension, preec-
lampsia, eclampsia, and Hemolysis, Elevated Liver enzymes, 
Low Platelet count (HELLP) syndrome) or hypertension 
that existed prior to pregnancy (referred to here as exist-
ing hypertension). We classified women as having no con-
dition if they had no maternal cardiometabolic risk factors

(i.e. hypertensive disorders of pregnancy, maternal diabetes, 
and/or prepregnancy obesity).
Gestational age was determined by the first day of the last 
menstrual period and early prenatal ultrasonographic results 
and categorized into term (≥37 weeks) and preterm (<37 
weeks).17 Birthweight was abstracted from the electronic medi-
cal record. Birthweight for gestational age was categorized into 
3 groups: small for gestational age (<10th percentile), large for 
gestational age (>90th percentile), and appropriate for gesta-
tional age (10th–90th percentile) according to an established 
local gender- and race-specific reference population.22
Anthropometric outcomes and BP
Child weight and height were measured by medical staff 
during well-child visits as documented in the electronic 
medical record. Height and weight were converted to age- 
and sex-specific height z-scores and weight z-scores using 
US reference data.23 For our primary outcome variable, we 
used SBP data as measured by medical staff in seated children 
at age 3–9 years. We focused on childhood SBP rather than 
diastolic BP because it is a better predictor of later outcomes 
and is more accurately measured.24,25 BP was measured in a 
quiet room, using an appropriate size cuff, measured at the 
right brachial artery using the validated automatic sphyg-
momanometer Masimo Set (2003–2008: the Welch Allyn 
420 Spot Vital Signs monitor; 2008–2014: the Welch Allyn 
45MT0 Spot Vital Signs LXi monitor). BP was measured 
twice, after a test measurement, and was considered valid 
if the difference between the 2 measurements was less than 
10 mm Hg, otherwise a third measurement was taken. SBP 
was calculated by taking the mean value of the systolic meas-
urements. SBP percentile was calculated using a US national 
for age-, sex-, and height-specific reference.26 In line with 
previous definitions used among pediatric populations,27 we 
defined elevated SBP as SBP ≥75th percentile.
Ascertainment of plasma folate and vitamin B12 levels
Plasma folate and vitamin B12 levels were measured by a 
commercial laboratory via chemiluminescent immunoassay 
using a MAGLUMI 2000 Analyzer (Snibe) with an interas-
say coefficient of variation of less than 4%.28
Statistical analysis
Our primary outcome of interest was SBP measured at the 
last well-child visit. We modeled SBP percentile (continuous 
variable) and elevated SBP (binary). Our primary exposure 
variable was maternal folate level, assessed overall, and per 
maternal cardiometabolic risk factor status.
We first examined the linear association of maternal 
plasma folate and child SBP percentile using smooth-
ing plots (PROCLOESS). After determining that the asso-
ciation was nonlinear, we modeled folate in quartiles. We 
then examined quartiles of folate levels with child SBP 
percentile and elevated SBP. To assure statistical power for 
the tests, we also categorized folate into above the median 
(range: 30.33–185.51 nmol/l) and below the median (range: 
6.64–30.31 nmol/l).
As a next step, we estimated the association between 
maternal folate and child SBP (linear regression) and child-
elevated SBP (logistic regression) in different strata of 
maternal risk factors. We evaluated whether maternal car-
diometabolic risk factors modified (on the multiplicative 
scale) the association of maternal folate status with child 
SBP percentiles or odds of elevated SBP by including, in our 
multivariable models, a cross-product term for any maternal 
cardiometabolic risk factors (yes vs. no) with maternal folate 
status.
We adjusted multivariable regression models for mater-
nal age, race, education, smoking, alcohol intake, parity, 
perceived stress during pregnancy, and plasma vitamin B12 
level during pregnancy. Covariates were selected based on 
previous literature documenting their association with the 
exposure and outcome of interest in our study. We further 
adjusted models for child plasma folate levels. Child age, 
sex, and height were not included in the regression models 
because they were already accounted for when we defined 
the outcome variables. In additional models we included: 
(i) gestational age and birth size in the regression models 
to assess mediation by these factors and (ii) prenatal vita-
min intake and breastfeeding in the regression models to 
assess whether maternal folate was independent of these 
variables. To further assess the robustness of the findings, 
we conducted analyses restricted to participants who were 
Black race, and children ages 6–9 years at BP measurement. 
All statistical tests were 2-sided and significance was defined 
at P <0.05. All analyses were performed using SAS (SAS 
Institute), version 9.4.
RESULTS
We included 1,290 mother–child pairs, 875 of which were 
Black (67.8%) and 247 Hispanic (19.2%). Of the mothers, 
492 (38.2%) had one or more cardiometabolic risk factors; 
188 (14.6%) had hypertensive disorders, 143 (11.1%) had 
diabetes, and 324 (25.1%) had prepregnancy obesity. The 
median (interquartile range) for maternal plasma folate level 
was 30.32 nmol/l (interquartile range: 19.71–44.16 nmol/l). 
A total of 370 (28.7%) children had elevated SBP at age 
3–9 years. Children with higher SBP were more likely to 
have mothers with prepregnancy obesity, hypertensive dis-
orders, and diabetes. Children with elevated SBP were also 
more likely to have lower birthweight, lower gestational age, 
and higher current BMI (Table 1).
MATERNAL FOLATE LEVEL, MATERNAL 
CARDIOMETABOLIC RISK FACTORS, AND CHILD SBP
Children born to mothers with the presence of hyper-
tensive disorders, diabetes, prepregnancy obesity, or any 
cardiometabolic risk factors had higher SBP percentiles 
and higher odds of elevated SBP, before and after adjust-
ing for covariates. Overall, maternal folate levels were 
not associated with child SBP percentile or elevated SBP 
(Table 2). However, the association of maternal folate lev-
els and child SBP was modified by maternal cardiometa-
bolic risk factors.

As shown in Figure 1, there was a synergistic joint asso-
ciation of maternal folate levels and cardiometabolic risk 
factors with odds of offspring having elevated SBP. Children 
born to mothers with cardiometabolic risk factors (hyper-
tensive disorders, diabetes, prepregnancy obesity, and any 
cardiometabolic risk factors) and folate levels below the 
median had a 1.65- to 1.90-fold higher odds of elevated 
SBP, compared to children whose mothers had high median 
folate levels with no maternal cardiometabolic risk factors 
(no condition).
To assure statistical power for the test of multiplicative 
interaction, we focused on mothers with any cardiometa-
bolic risk factors vs. no cardiometabolic risk factors. We 
found a statistically significant interaction between any 
maternal risk factors and folate on the odds of elevated SBP 
(Pinteraction = 0.015) (Table 3). Among children of mothers with 
risk factors, those who were born to mothers in the lowest 
quartile of folate (compared to those born to mothers in the 
highest quartile of folate) had higher odds of child-elevated 
SBP (odds ratio = 1.99; 95% confidence interval: 1.11–3.56).

Maternal Plasma Folate and Offspring Blood Pressure
Similar associations were found when we examined associa-
tions above vs. below the median value for folate. Among the 
group with any maternal cardiometabolic risk factors, chil-
dren born to mothers with high median folate levels were 
at 40% lower odds of having elevated SBP compared with 
children of mothers with low median folate levels (odds 
ratio = 0.60, 95% confidence interval: 0.40–0.90, P = 0.01). 
There was no such association in children born to mothers 
without the presence of cardiometabolic risk factors.
SENSITIVITY ANALYSES TO ASSESS THE ROBUSTNESS OF 
THE FINDINGS
Further adjustment for preterm birth, size at birth (data 
not shown), prenatal vitamin intake in the third trimester, 
and breastfeeding status (Supplementary eTable 2) did not 
materially alter our findings. The associations described 
above also did not differ appreciably when we restricted anal-
yses to Black mother–child pairs (Supplementary eTables 3

and 4) or to children aged 6–9 years at follow up 
(Supplementary eTables 5 and 6). Furthermore, there was no 
correlation between the mother’s and the child’s folate levels 
(P = 0.66) and the strata-specific associations of maternal 
folate with offspring BP outcomes remained after adjust-
ment for child folate status (Supplementary eTable 7).
DISCUSSION
To our knowledge, this was the first prospective birth 
cohort study to evaluate the association of maternal plasma 
folate level with childhood SBP across strata of maternal 
cardiometabolic risk factors. Overall, maternal folate during 
pregnancy had little or no impact on child SBP. However, 
among children from mothers with cardiometabolic risk 
factors, low maternal folate was associated with higher odds 
of elevated childhood SBP.
There is growing evidence that, through their impact on 
the fetal intrauterine environment, maternal cardiometa-
bolic risk factors during pregnancy may influence develop-
ment of hypertension in offpsring. Consistent with previous 
studies,13–15 we found that children born to mothers with the 
presence of hypertensive disorders, diabetes, and prepreg-
nancy obesity had higher SBP.
Although folate is known to be a critical nutrient for 
reducing risk of birth defects,6 its potential role in altering 
offspring risk of high BP has been little explored. Outside 
of pregnancy, in adults and adolescents, several studies have 
shown that folate is associated with BP9 and related car-
diovascular phenotypes like carotid artery stenosis29 and 
stroke.28 One study found that maternal folate and vitamin 
B12 in early pregnancy may be involved in cardiometabolic 
health of the offspring at age 5–6 years.30 Our findings show 
that higher maternal folate in pregnancy may help mitigate 
the risk of elevated offspring BP associated with children 
born to mothers who have cardiometabolic risk. Future 
studies are needed to confirm our findings, and if replicated, 
determine what level of folate and through which sources, 
confers protection.
McNulty31 reported on a pilot randomized controlled trial 
in pregnant women that continued supplementation with 
400 µg FA/d in the second and third trimesters of pregnancy 
can increase maternal and cord blood folate status in late 
pregnancy. However, there is little clinical evidence to show 
how much maternal folate is needed to reach a protective 
level to prevent adverse childhood outcomes. In the BBC, 
about 90% of women took prenatal vitamins ≥3/week dur-
ing their third trimester of pregnancy. The median maternal 
blood folate level for women in our cohort was 30.32 nmol/l 
(13.4 ng/ml), which is comparable with the US general pop-
ulation (median folate from NHANES = 10.6–12.6 ng/ml).32 
Maternal prenatal vitamin use did not appear to differ across 
maternal blood folate levels. Thus, differences in blood folate 
may derive from differences in dietary folate or to variation 
in folate absorption. Unfortunately, we do not have data on 
dietary intake to directly test these hypotheses.
The mechanisms underlying the potentially beneficial 
influence of maternal folate on child SBP among mothers 
with risk factors are not clear. Maternal cardiometabolic dis-
orders have been shown to lead to placental and systemic 
inflammation and oxidative stress,33,34 and folate has been 
shown to alleviate oxidative stress.35,36 Although higher 
inflammatory status and homocysteine level have been 
linked with low blood folate levels, in our study the asso-
ciation of maternal folate with child-elevated SBP was inde-
pendent of maternal inflammatory and homocysteine status 
(data not shown), suggesting these factors do not explain the 
observed findings. As such, future studies are needed to elu-
cidate the potential underlying mechanisms.
Our study had several limitations. We used maternal 
plasma folate levels taken 2–3 days after delivery, which is at 
best a proxy of folate nutrition during the third trimester of 
pregnancy. Although we did not measure fetal folate levels, 
a previous study has suggested that there is a high degree 
of transplacental passage of maternal folate to the fetus.37 
Maternal prepregnancy BMI was based on self-reported 
height and weight, thus it may be subject to reporting bias. 
Nevertheless, in a subset of the study population (N = 672), 
self-reported BMIs compared to those taken from medi-
cal records showed a high degree of agreement (r = 0.89, 
P < 0.001). In addition, our exclusion of 587 children for a 
variety of reasons may have resulted in selection bias, though 
their demographic characteristics were comparable with 
those of the included participants. Furthermore, the BBC 
is an urban, predominantly low-income birth cohort that 
is enriched by preterm, low birthweight babies.17 Because 
of these design features, the BBC has a larger proportion of 
African Americans and ethnic minorities than the Boston 
metropolitan area general population. Future studies of the 
maternal folate–child BP relationship need to examine if 
the associations observed in our unique, high risk popula-
tion generalize to other races, ethnicities, or cohorts with 
different clinical characteristics. Another limitation of our 
study is that it is observational, and thus we cannot rule out 
the possibility of residual confounding by measured covari-
ates or confounding by factors not measured in our study, 
such as genetic polymorphisms or maternal uric acid levels, 
which could have influenced maternal levels of folic acid and 
childhood SBP.
Perspectives
In this urban and predominantly low-income, racial-and-
ethnic minority, prospective birth cohort, mothers with car-
diometabolic risk factors who had adequate-to-high plasma 
folate at the end of pregnancy had offspring with lower SBP 
and lower odds of elevated SBP during childhood, suggest-
ing that high folate levels during pregnancy may counteract 
the adverse impacts of maternal cardiometabolic risk fac-
tors on offspring SBP. Interventions focused on increasing 
maternal folate intake among mothers with metabolic risk 
factors may help mitigate the transgenerational association 
of cardiometabolic diseases.
