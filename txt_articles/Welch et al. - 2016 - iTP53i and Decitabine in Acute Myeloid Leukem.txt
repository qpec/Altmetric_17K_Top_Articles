BACKGROUND
The molecular determinants of clinical responses to decitabine therapy in patients with 
acute myeloid leukemia (AML) or myelodysplastic syndromes (MDS) are unclear.
METHODS
We enrolled 84 adult patients with AML or MDS in a single-institution trial of decitabine 
to identify somatic mutations and their relationships to clinical responses. Decitabine was 
administered at a dose of 20 mg per square meter of body-surface area per day for 10 
consecutive days in monthly cycles. We performed enhanced exome or gene-panel se-
quencing in 67 of these patients and serial sequencing at multiple time points to evaluate 
patterns of mutation clearance in 54 patients. An extension cohort included 32 addi-
tional patients who received decitabine in different protocols.
RESULTS
Of the 116 patients, 53 (46%) had bone marrow blast clearance (<5% blasts). Response 
rates were higher among patients with an unfavorable-risk cytogenetic profile than 
among patients with an intermediate-risk or favorable-risk cytogenetic profile (29 of 43 
patients [67%] vs. 24 of 71 patients [34%], P<0.001) and among patients with TP53 muta-
tions than among patients with wild-type TP53 (21 of 21 [100%] vs. 32 of 78 [41%], 
P<0.001). Previous studies have consistently shown that patients with an unfavorable-risk 
cytogenetic profile and TP53 mutations who receive conventional chemotherapy have poor 
outcomes. However, in this study of 10-day courses of decitabine, neither of these risk 
factors was associated with a lower rate of overall survival than the rate of survival among 
study patients with intermediate-risk cytogenetic profiles.
CONCLUSIONS
Patients with AML and MDS who had cytogenetic abnormalities associated with unfavor-
able risk, TP53 mutations, or both had favorable clinical responses and robust (but incom-
plete) mutation clearance after receiving serial 10-day courses of decitabine. Although 
these responses were not durable, they resulted in rates of overall survival that were 
similar to those among patients with AML who had an intermediate-risk cytogenetic 
profile and who also received serial 10-day courses of decitabine. (Funded by the Na-

The new engl and jour nal of medicine
A 
cute myeloid leukemia (AML) and 
myelodysplastic syndromes (MDS) are 
clonal disorders of myeloid hematopoie-
sis.1 Adult patients with AML who have karyo-
types that are associated with unfavorable risk 
and older patients with AML (≥60 years of age) 
have poor outcomes, with a median survival of 
approximately 1 year.2,3 Patients with AML and 
TP53 mutations tend to be older (median age, 
61 to 67 years), and almost all have karyotypes 
that are associated with unfavorable risk; if they 
receive standard cytotoxic chemotherapy, these 
patients have especially poor outcomes (median 
survival, 4 to 6 months).3-6
Decitabine (5-aza-2′-deoxycytidine) is common-
ly used as a single agent to treat patients with 
MDS and elderly patients with AML.7 However, 
response rates are low. Combined rates of com-
plete remission (complete remission with recov-
ery of peripheral-blood counts) and complete 
remission with incomplete count recovery typi-
cally range from 20 to 35%.8 Studies with longer 
exposure times to decitabine (administered on 
days 1 through 10 of 28-day cycles instead of on 
days 1 through 5) show an improved response 
rate (range, 40 to 64%).9,10
Several studies have sought to identify bio-
markers (e.g., DNA methylation changes10-13 and 
mutations in DNMT3A, IDH1, IDH2, and TET2,14-16 
along with miR-29b expression10) that might pre-
dict responses to decitabine. However, contro-
versy still exists concerning the predictive value 
of these biomarkers, and none are currently used 
to guide decitabine therapy for individual patients.
In this trial, we used enhanced exome sequenc-
ing17 and gene-panel sequencing to determine 
whether the presence of specific mutations might 
correlate with a response or with resistance to 
decitabine and to characterize patterns of muta-
tion clearance. Surprisingly, we found that clini-
cal responses were highly correlated with the pres-
ence of TP53 mutations in the founding clone at 
presentation and that the rate of overall survival 
with 10-day courses of decita 
bine was similar 
among patients with cytogenetic abnormalities 
associated with unfavorable risk and among those 
with an intermediate-risk cytogenetic profile. Fi-
nally, serial exome sequencing revealed consis-
tent mutation clearance in all evaluated patients 
with AML or MDS who had TP53 mutations. 
However, mutation clearance was never complete 
in patients who had a response to decitabine, 
even in those with complete clinical remission.
Methods
Trial Design and Oversight
In this prospective, uncontrolled trial, 84 patients 
received decitabine at a dose of 20 mg per square 
meter of body-surface area per day on days 1 
through 10 of 28-day cycles at Washington Uni-
versity in St. Louis between March 2013 and 
November 2015. The protocol is available with 
the full text of this article at NEJM.org.
The trial was approved by the institutional re-
view board at Washington University in St. Louis 
and was conducted in accordance with the provi-
sions of the Declaration of Helsinki. All the patients 
who were enrolled at Washington University in St. 
Louis provided written informed consent that ex-
plicitly included genome sequencing and data shar-
ing with qualified investigators. Additional pa-
tients who were included in the extension cohort 
were enrolled in a study at the University of Chi-
cago under an institutional review board–approved 
protocol that allowed for gene-panel sequencing 
and data sharing with qualified investigators. 
All the authors made the decision to submit the 
manuscript for publication and vouch for the 
adherence to the study protocol and for the ac-
curacy and completeness of the data reported.
The trial was designed and the manuscript was 
written by the first and last authors. The inves-
tigators performed the data analysis. No com-
mercial entities were involved in the support, 
design, analysis, or manuscript preparation.
Objectives
The primary objective of the trial was to cor-
relate clinical responses with mutation status. 
Secondary objectives were to correlate responses 
with the rate of mutation clearance, steady-state 
plasma decitabine levels, and methylation chang-
es on day 10 of cycle 1.
Eligibility
Three groups of patients were enrolled: those with 
AML (excluding patients with acute promyelocytic 
leukemia) who were 60 years of age or older, 
those with relapsed AML, and those with trans-
fusion-dependent MDS (Table 1). All the patients 
had an Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group per-
formance-status score of 2 or less (on a 5-point 
scale, with higher numbers indicating increas-
ing disability; lower numbers indicate greater 
functional independence, and a score of 3 indi-
cates confinement to a bed or chair for >50% of

waking hours), and preserved end-organ function 
(see the Methods section of the Supplementary 
Appendix, available at NEJM.org). Eligibility re-
quirements were intentionally broad and designed 
to reflect typical patterns of deci 
tabine use.
Response Criteria and End Points
Bone marrow samples were obtained on day 0, 
on day 10 of cycle 1, on day 28 of cycle 1, and on 
day 28 of even-numbered cycles. Deviation of up 
to 1 day for sample collection on day 10 and up to 
2 days for sample collection on day 28 was per-
mitted for patient convenience. Responses were 
reported on an intention-to-treat basis and were 
categorized according to the criteria of the Inter-
national Working Group for Diagnosis, Standard-
ization of Response Criteria, Treatment Out-
comes, and Reporting Standards for Therapeutic 
Trials in Acute Myeloid Leukemia and in Myelo-
dysplastic Syndromes. These categories were com-
plete remission, complete remission with incom-
plete count recovery, morphologic complete 
remission, partial response, stable disease, and 
progressive disease.18,19 Patients from whom a 
bone marrow sample was not obtained on or 
after day 28 of cycle 1 were not evaluated. Bone 
marrow blast counts were reviewed centrally.
Patients with samples that were characterized 
in sequencing and methylation array studies were 
selected on the basis of clinical responses (i.e., a 
response that could be evaluated after two cycles 
or evidence of progressive disease after one cycle) 
and sufficient amounts of high-quality DNA. 
Karyotypes that are associated with unfavorable 
risk were defined as the presence of three or 
more abnormalities, deletions involving chromo-
somes 5, 7, or 17, or abnormalities in chromo-
some 11 involving MLL. In patients with MDS, an 
isolated chromosome 5q deletion was not consid-
ered to be associated with unfavorable risk.
Extension Cohort
An extension cohort included 32 additional pa-
tients. Of these patients, 24 had relapsed AML 
and received decitabine at a dose of 20 mg per 
square meter per day on days 1 through 10 in 
28-day cycles between April 2005 and March 
2010 at the University of Chicago.
The other eight patients all had AML, were 
60 years of age or older, and received decitabine 
at a dose of 20 mg per square meter per day on 
days 1 through 5 in 28-day cycles at Washington 
University in St. Louis between January 2009 and 
June 2014. Five patients received decitabine as a 
single agent and three patients received decita-
bine in combination with panobinostat (a histone 
deacetylase inhibitor) at a dose of 10 mg per day 
three times a week.
Molecular Analyses
Libraries for enhanced exome sequencing were 
enriched with the use of the NimbleGen exome 
reagent, version 3, with the addition of biotinyl-
ated probes targeting 264 genes that are recur-
rently mutated in patients with AML,17,20 and the 
libraries were sequenced with the use of the Illu-
mina HiSeq 2000 or 2500 platforms. Amplicon-
based panel testing that was designed to detect 
all common mutations within 8 genes (TP53, 
DNMT3A, IDH1, IDH2, ASXL1, SRSF2, U2AF1, and 
SF3B1) was performed with the use of the Ion 
AmpliSeq platform (see Table S1 and the Meth-
ods section in the Supplementary Appendix). 
Exome sequencing data are being deposited in the 
database of Genotypes and Phenotypes under 
the accession number phs000159. DNA methyla-
tion arrays were performed and analyzed as de-
scribed previously.20 Methylation array data have 
been deposited in the Gene Expression Omnibus 
under the accession number GSE80762.
Statistical Analysis
Statistical analysis was performed with the use 
of Excel (Microsoft), GraphPad Prism (GraphPad 
Software), and SAS, version 9.3 for Windows 
(SAS Institute). A detailed description of the 
statistical methods is provided in the Methods 
section in the Supplementary Appendix.
Results
Patients
We enrolled 84 patients with AML or MDS in a 
prospective clinical trial of single-agent decita-
bine at Washington University in St. Louis (Ta-
ble 1 and Fig. 1A). Patients received a median of 
two cycles of decitabine, and 59 patients received 
at least two cycles. The median follow-up of the 
19 patients who remained alive was 19 months.
An additional 32 patients who had received a 
similar regimen outside the aegis of our trial 
made up an independent extension set. These 
patients received the same 10-day decitabine 
regimen at the University of Chicago or decitabine 
in a 5-day regimen at Washington University in 
St. Louis.

Toxic Effects
As expected, adverse events were predominantly 
associated with neutropenia and thrombocyto-
penia (Table S2 in the Supplementary Appen-

total of 128 events of grade 3 through 5. Of 
these events, 93 (in 56 patients) were febrile 
neutropenia or other infectious events, and 9 (in

8 patients) were bleeding complications or trans-
fusion reactions. Eight treatment-related deaths 
were due to infection (in 6 patients), acute kidney 
injury (in 1 patient), or cardiac arrest (in 1 patient).
Response
A total of 15 of the 116 patients in the combined 
patient cohorts (13%) had a complete remission, 
and an additional 38 patients had bone marrow 
blast clearance with less than 5% blasts (com-
plete remission with incomplete count recovery 
or morphologic complete remission), for an over-
all response rate of 46%. A partial response was 
observed in 9 patients (8%), stable disease in 23 
patients (20%), and progressive disease in 19 pa-
tients (16%) (Table 1).
Twelve patients withdrew from the protocol 
before a bone marrow biopsy could be performed 
at the end of cycle 1 and therefore could not be 
clinically evaluated for a response. Of these pa-
tients, 6 transitioned to hospice, 2 transitioned 
to cytotoxic chemotherapy, 2 had progressive dis-
ease, 1 had a myocardial infarction after one 
dose, and acute renal failure developed after one 
dose in 1 who had undergone orthotopic kidney 
transplantation. Responses correlated with the 
median number of cycles and performance status, 
but not with age or white-cell counts (Fig. S1A 
through S1E in the Supplementary Appendix).10
Mutation Clearance
The first 39 patients with samples that were 
sufficient for analysis constituted the discovery 
cohort. Samples were serially evaluated with en-
hanced exome sequencing (median, four separate 
time points per patient, 157 exomes in total) 
(Table S3 in the Supplementary Appendix). In 
patients with AML and patients with MDS, the 
clearance of leukemia-specific mutations corre-
lated closely with morphologic and cytogenetic 
responses (Fig. 1B and 1C).
We used gene-panel sequencing to evaluate 
sequential samples obtained from 15 additional 
patients at multiple time points. In total, 54 pa-
tients had samples that underwent serial evalua-
tion. Mutations in only two genes (TP53 and 
SF3B1) had consistent, rapid reductions in variant 
allele frequency to levels of less than 5% (Fig. 1D 
and 1E). Bone marrow blast clearance frequently 
preceded mutation reduction (in 15 of 54 pa-
tients) (Fig. 1B, and Fig. S3B and S3C in the 
Supplementary Appendix), and mutation clear-
ance was never complete.
We examined samples obtained from 20 pa-
tients with bone marrow blast clearance (those 
with complete remission, complete remission with 
incomplete count recovery, or morphologic com-
plete remission) after day 28 of cycle 2. In these 
patients, we were able to detect leukemia-specific 
mutations during morphologic remission. This 
indicated that decitabine leads only to incomplete 
clearance of disease (average founding clone 
variant allele frequency at maximum clearance, 
0.06% to 18.43%) (Fig. S1F in the Supplementary 
Appendix). We observed no difference in the ex-
tent of leukemia-specific mutation clearance be-
tween patients who had peripheral-blood count 
recovery (complete remission) and those who did 
not (complete remission with incomplete count 
recovery or morphologic complete remission), 
and the duration of remissions was similar in 
both groups (Fig. S1G and S1H in the Supple-
mentary Appendix).
Differential sensitivity to decitabine was ob-
served within subclones in 11 patients with 
samples that were evaluated by means of exome 
sequencing. Patterns that were observed includ-
ed sensitive subclones within the background 
of a largely resistant founding clone in 2 patients 
(Fig. S3A in the Supplementary Appendix) and 
subclones with primary resistance to decitabine 
in 9 patients (Fig. S3B in the Supplementary Ap-
pendix). In the 9 patients who were evaluated at 
relapse, progression was associated with the out-
growth of one or more subclones, some of which 
were detectable before therapy (Fig. 1B and 1C, 
and Fig. S3B in the Supplementary Appendix).
Nonleukemic “rising clones” were also ob-
served in 7 of the 22 patients who had a response 
(Fig. 1B and 1C, and Fig. S3C and S3D in the 
Supplementary Appendix), as described in pa-
tients with AML who have received induction 
therapy with daunorubicin and cytarabine.22 In 
2 patients, the rising clones contained mutations 
in genes (DNMT3A and PPM1D) that had been 
previously identified in patients with age-related 
clonal hematopoiesis of indeterminate poten-
tial23-26; data on the other genes in clonal hema-
topoiesis (RUNX1, UNC5C, RRN3P2, and SCAMP5) 
are lacking. We did not observe a correlation 
between the presence of clonal hematopoiesis in 
remission and incomplete hematopoietic count 
recovery (P 
= 
0.36 for the comparison between pa-
tients who had complete remission and incomplete 
count recovery or morphologic complete remis-
sion and patients who had complete remission).

TP53 in AML and Myelodysplastic Syndromes
Patients with stable disease and partial re-
sponses typically had stable or slowly decreasing 
mutation burdens, as expected (Figs. S4 and S5 
in the Supplementary Appendix). However, all 
three cases of rapidly progressive disease were 
associated with stable mutation burdens (Fig. S6 
in the Supplementary Appendix).
Correlation between Responses  
and Mutations and Cytogenetic Profiles
Among the first 39 patients, who constituted 
the discovery cohort, we observed blast clear-
ance from the bone marrow (<5% residual 
blasts) in 22 patients (with complete remission, 
complete remission with incomplete count re-
covery, or morphologic complete remission). 
Surprisingly, all 7 patients with TP53 mutations 
had a response with bone marrow blast clear-
ance, as compared with 15 of 32 patients with-
out TP53 mutations (47%) (P 
= 
0.02) (Fig. 2A).
We therefore used gene-panel sequencing to 
evaluate samples obtained from 60 additional 
patients (51 with AML and 9 with MDS): 28 pa-
tients who were enrolled in this trial, 8 patients 
who received decitabine delivered in 5-day cycles 
at Washington University in St. Louis, and 24 
patients who received decitabine with 10-day 
cycles at the University of Chicago (Figs. 1A and 
2B). We observed TP53 mutations in 14 of 60 
patients: 14 of 14 had blast clearance (complete 
remission, complete remission with incomplete 
count recovery, or morphologic complete remis-
sion) with decitabine therapy, and 17 of 46 pa-
tients with wild-type TP53 had blast clearance 
(P<0.001). One additional patient (Patient 1080) 
had evidence of TP53 loss of heterozygosity by 
single-nucleotide-polymorphism analysis in the 
gene-panel test and add(17)(p13) by cytogenetic 
profile, but a somatic mutation in TP53 coding 
sequences was not detected.
Of the samples obtained for sequencing from 
53 patients who had a response (complete remis-
sion, complete remission with incomplete count 
recovery, or morphologic complete remission), 
21 had TP53 mutations (40%) (P<0.001) (Fig. 2C, 
and Fig. S7 in the Supplementary Appendix). The 
spectrum of TP53 mutations that was detected in 
this cohort was very similar to that of mutations 
reported in other studies of AML, including the 
Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) Research Network 
study of AML20 (Fig. 2D, and Table S5 in the 
Supplementary Appendix).
Correlation between Responses  
and Biomarkers
We correlated two pharmacologic markers with 
clinical responses to determine whether insuffi-
cient administration of decitabine or a failure 
of decitabine to cause DNA hypomethylation for 
other reasons was associated with a poor response. 
We observed no correlation between steady-state 
plasma decitabine levels on day 4 of the first 
cycle and responses (Fig. 3A).
Bone marrow samples that were obtained on 
day 0 and on day 10 of cycle 1 were evaluated for 
CpG methylation values at approximately 450,000 
genomic positions with the use of the Illumina 
HumanMethylation450 BeadChip. In patients with 
AML and those with MDS, the reduction in 
methylcytosine content from day 0 to day 10 of 
cycle 1 was similar in patients who had a re-
sponse (complete remission, complete remission 
with incomplete count recovery, or morphologic 
complete remission) and those who did not have 
a response (partial response, stable disease, or 
Figure 1 (facing page). Clinical Responses in Patients 
with TP53 Mutations.
Panel A shows patients with acute myeloid leukemia 
(AML) or myelodysplastic syndromes (MDS) in the 
discovery and extension cohorts. Samples obtained 
from 67 patients were evaluated in the study with se-
quence analysis at Washington University in St. Louis, 
and 32 additional patients, who received treatment at 
the University of Chicago or on alternative protocols at 
Washington University in St. Louis, were also included 
in the extension analysis. Panels B and C show muta-
tion clearance observed in 2 patients with TP53 muta-
tions. The variant allele frequency is the percentage of 
total reads that support a specific somatic mutation. 
The variant allele frequency of each identified mutation 
is indicated across time points. Variants in TP53 are indi-
cated in red, variants in DNMT3A are indicated in blue, 
mutations in genes that are not recurrently mutated in 
AML20 are indicated in purple, and blast counts are indi-
cated in orange. Relapse occurred in the patients shown 
in Panels B and C at day 28 of cycle 8. In Panel C, patient 
1023 also had hematologic improvement in platelet 
and neutrophil counts but incomplete recovery of red 
cells. Panel D shows the rate of clearance of 21 TP53 
mutations identified in 16 patients. Panel E shows the 
rate of clearance of mutations (specifically, in genes 
that were mutated in at least 5 of the 54 patients with 
samples that could be evaluated), with a median of 
four time points evaluated in each patient. One-way 
analysis of variance and the Tukey multiple-comparison 
test were performed to compare the means of muta-
tion clearance for each gene. Horizontal bars with an 
asterisk denote P<0.05 for the indicated comparisons. 
Short horizontal bars within the data points denote the 
mean mutation clearance rate for the indicated gene.

TP53 in AML and Myelodysplastic Syndromes
progressive disease). This reduction was also 
similar in patients who had TP53 mutations and 
those who did not have TP53 mutations and did 
not correlate with morphologic responses (Fig. 3B 
through 3D).
We observed very little change in subclonal ar-
chitecture between day 0 and day 10 of cycle 1 in 
all patients (Fig. 1B and 1C, and Figs. S3 through 
S6 in the Supplementary Appendix). This find-
ing suggests that the observed methylation 
changes were not the result of rapid shifts in the 
subclonal composition of samples with therapy.
Correlation between Biomarkers  
and Survival
The analysis of survival outcomes was not a pri-
mary objective of this clinical trial owing to the 
lack of a comparator group and the anticipated 
heterogeneity of the patients enrolled. However, 
because the rate of overall survival correlated with 
clinical response, disease, age, and performance 
status, as expected10,21 (Fig. 4A, and Fig. S8 in 
the Supplementary Appendix), we performed a 
post hoc correlation between TP53 mutation 
status and cytogenetic risk.
TP53 mutations were observed almost exclu-
sively in patients with unfavorable-risk cytoge-
netic profiles, as expected, in 20 of 21 patients 
(Fig. 4B); 1 patient had normal cytogenetic find-
ings, but only five metaphases were evaluated. 
Surprisingly, overall survival was not negatively 
affected by cytogenetic abnormalities associated 
with unfavorable risk (Fig. 4C) (median survival, 
11.6 months among patients with unfavorable 
risk and 10 months among patients with favor-
able or intermediate risk, P 
= 
0.29) or the pres-
ence of TP53 mutations (Fig. 4D) (median sur-
vival, 12.7 months among patients with TP53 
mutations and 15.4 months among patients with 
wild-type TP53, P 
= 
0.79). TP53 mutations were 
associated with a trend toward decreased sur-
vival among patients with MDS, but not among 
patients with AML (P 
= 
0.08) (Fig. S9A through 
S9D in the Supplementary Appendix).
Of all the factors analyzed, treatment con-
solidation with allogeneic stem-cell transplanta-
tion had the greatest effect on overall survival 
(Cox proportional-hazards model with stepwise 
regression for transplantation vs. no transplan-
tation, P<0.001) (Fig. 4E, and Fig. S8 in the Sup-
plementary Appendix). However, transplantation 
and survival outcomes were not adversely affected 
by TP53 status (Fig. 4F, and Fig. S8F in the Sup-
plementary Appendix).
Discussion
This trial was designed to identify molecular 
markers associated with a response or with re-
sistance to single-agent decitabine in patients 
with AML or MDS. Clinical responses correlated 
strongly with the presence of karyotypes associ-
ated with unfavorable risk and the presence of 
TP53 mutations. We observed bone marrow blast 
clearance (complete remission, complete remis-
sion with incomplete count recovery, or morpho-
logic complete remission) in 29 of 43 patients 
with karyotypes associated with unfavorable risk 
(67%) versus 24 of 71 patients with karyotypes 
associated with intermediate or favorable risk 
(34%) and in 21 of 21 patients with TP53 muta-
tions (100%) versus 32 of 78 patients with wild-
type TP53 (41%) (P<0.001 for both comparisons) 
(Fig. 2). A total of 20 of 21 patients with TP53 
mutations had a karyotype associated with unfa-
vorable risk. Other investigators have also found 
that response rates among patients who have 
AML or MDS with karyotypes associated with 
unfavorable risk and who receive decitabine or 
azacitidine are at least equivalent to, if not 
slightly higher than, those among patients with 
an intermediate-risk cytogenetic profile.9,10,27-29
These outcomes contrast sharply with those 
in patients with AML who receive standard an-
thracycline-based and cytarabine-based induction 
chemotherapy, in whom the presence of TP53 
mutations is associated with a dismal prognosis, 
with initial response rates of only 20 to 30%.3,30 
Furthermore, median survival among these pa-
tients tends to be 4 to 6 months, with overall

Mutations and Clinical Responses.
Panel A shows the results of enhanced exome sequenc-
ing in the discovery cohort among patients who had a 
response (complete remission, complete remission with 
incomplete count recovery, or morphologic complete re-
mission) or no response (partial response, stable disease, 
or progressive disease). Panel B shows the results of gene-
panel sequencing (264 genes in 15 patients and 8 genes 
in 45 patients) in patients in the extension cohort. ND de-
notes not done. Panel C shows the proportions of patients 
among all those in whom samples were sequenced (99 pa-
tients) who had a response or did not have a response, ac-
cording to the presence of the indicated mutations. Panel D 
shows the locations and predicted consequences of TP53 
mutations identified in this trial and in patients with AML 
in the Cancer Genome Atlas Research Network cohort.20

survival of only approximately 10 months after 
allogeneic stem-cell transplantation4,30,31; this con-
trasts with the 12.7-month median survival in 
the cohort of patients who received decitabine. 
These data suggest that the poor prognosis as-
sociated with an unfavorable-risk cytogenetic 
profile, the presence of TP53 mutations, or both 
may be specific for the treatment approach and 
may be mitigated with decitabine therapy.
Two previously recognized clinical features of 
decitabine responses have been clarified by this 
analysis. First, responses tend to be slow: most 
patients require at least two monthly cycles to 
achieve maximum clinical responses, and many

TP53 in AML and Myelodysplastic Syndromes
patients who have a response require three or 
more cycles.9,21 We observed that bone marrow 
blast clearance usually precedes mutation clear-
ance; this indicates that decitabine may induce 
differentiation before elimination of leukemic 
cells, as has been suggested previously.32 This 
process, like other differentiation responses, ap-
pears to require months of therapy. Second, re-
sponses are short-lived: remissions usually last 
less than a year, especially after discontinuation 
of therapy.33 Decitabine did not clear all leukemia-
specific mutations in any patient tested (Fig. 1, 
and Fig. S1 in the Supplementary Appendix). 
Thus, the short durations of remission are due to 
incomplete clearance of leukemia cells bearing 
the pathogenetically relevant driver mutations.
The mechanisms responsible for primary deci-
tabine resistance are not yet clear. Resistance 
does not appear to be due to inadequate dosing 
or metabolism of the drug; neither the levels of 
steady-state plasma decitabine nor the extent of 
reduction of cytosine methylation in bone mar-
row cells immediately after treatment correspond-
ed with clinical responses (Fig. 3). Therefore, 
decitabine appears to hit the methylation target 
in most patients, regardless of their clinical re-
sponses. Furthermore, we carefully evaluated the 
methylcytosine array data from these patients 
(and from those in the TCGA study of de novo 
AML20) to identify a canonical methylation signa-
ture driven by TP53 mutations. Such a signature 
would suggest that patients with TP53 mutations 
may be epigenetically primed to have a response 
to decitabine, but no such signature could be iden-
tified. The mechanisms underlying the sensitivity 
of patients with AML or MDS and TP53 mutations 
to decitabine are therefore unclear at present but 
will be important to define in other studies.
Subclones within individual AML samples 
have variable sensitivities to decitabine; this sug-
gests that subclones may contain genetic or epi-
genetic modifiers that influence their sensitivity to 
the drug. We observed both sensitive subclones 
(Fig. S3A in the Supplementary Appendix) and 
resistant subclones (Fig. S3B in the Supplemen-
tary Appendix); all relapses were associated with 
the expansion of one or more subclones (Fig. 1). 
No genetic rules could be established to predict 
subclonal sensitivity in this trial, although recur-
rent patterns may be identified in larger cohorts.
Although the presence of TP53 mutations ap-
pears to be associated with a high degree of 
decitabine sensitivity, relapses in these patients 
were also associated with the outgrowth of a 
preexisting subclone in all cases (Fig. 1B and 
1C). Thus, patients with TP53 mutations may not 
be invariably sensitive to decitabine, and resis-
tant populations of cells commonly emerge dur-
ing therapy. Furthermore, patients who have 
AML with TP53 mutations only in subclones (i.e., 
not in the founding clone) would not be ex-
pected to have complete clinical responses, since 
only a fraction of the tumor cells would be po-
tentially susceptible to decitabine. Regardless, 
the differential susceptibility of subclones to 
decitabine in individual patients strongly sug-
gests that the mechanisms of response are di-
rectly influenced by cell-intrinsic factors. How-
ever, it is also possible that decitabine could 
induce clinical responses in some patients 
Figure 3 (facing page). Correlation between Clinical 
 
Responses and Pharmacologic and DNA Methylation 
Measurements.
Panel A shows steady-state plasma decitabine levels 
that were determined during day 4 of cycle 1 (deviation 
of up to 1 day for sample collection was permitted for 
patient convenience) (P = 0.09 by analysis of variance 
for the comparison among all response groups). CR 
denotes complete remission, CRi complete remission 
with incomplete count recovery, mCR morphologic 
complete remission, meCpG methylated CpG, NA not 
applicable, PD progressive disease, PR partial response, 
and SD stable disease. The horizontal lines indicate pair-
wise comparisons with statistical differences. Panel B 
shows the absolute difference between the proportions 
of meCpGs on day 0 and day 10 of cycle 1, as deter-
mined with the use of Illumina HumanMethylation450 
BeadChip profiling (P = 0.19 by analysis of variance for 
the comparison among all response groups). The I bars 
indicate standard deviation. Panel C shows the mean 
fraction of meCpGs per sample on day 0 and day 10, 
according to data shown in Panel B. Panel D shows the 
differences in the mean fraction of differentially methyl-
ated CpGs (those with a change in methylation of ≥25%) 
between day 0 and day 10. In Panels C and D, the as-
terisks indicate P<0.001 for the indicated comparisons. 
Panels E and F show examples of CpG methylation val-
ues across approximately 450,000 unique CpGs in rep-
resentative patients. Samples from total bone marrow 
cells on day 0 and on day 10 of cycle 1 are compared. 
Red squares indicate CpGs with a difference of 25% or 
more in the proportion of cells with methylation at the 
indicated CpG, and gray squares indicate CpGs with a 
difference of less than 25%. Hypomethylation predom-
inantly occurs at highly methylated CpGs, and hypo-
methylation is incomplete within the total bone mar-
row population. P values were calculated with the use 
of one-way analysis of variance and the Tukey multiple-
comparison test. Similar results were obtained with the 
use of analysis of covariance (see the Methods section 
in the Supplementary Appendix).

TP53 in AML and Myelodysplastic Syndromes
through non–cell-intrinsic mechanisms. This 
drug can activate the expression of endogenous 
retroviruses and alter regulatory T-cell matura-
tion.34-36 Either of these mechanisms could po-
tentially alter the immune surveillance of AML 
or MDS cells and lead to clinical responses.
Finally, the rate of survival among patients 
with AML who have unfavorable-risk cytogenetic 
profiles, TP53 mutations, or both, and who re-
ceive decitabine is similar to that among pa-
tients with an intermediate-risk cytogenetic pro-
file who receive decitabine. Additional studies 
will be required to determine whether these 
differences in survival are truly due to improved 
responses associated with decitabine or whether 
conventional chemotherapy with an anthracy-
cline and cytarabine actually decreases the rate 
of survival among patients with unfavorable-risk 
cytogenetic profiles.
In conclusion, these data show that different 
groups of patients with AML or MDS are likely to 
have a different response to different types of che-
motherapy. Although patients with AML or MDS 
who have TP53 mutations have very low response 
rates after standard cytotoxic therapy, all patients 
with a TP53 mutation had a response to 10-day 
courses of decitabine in this trial. TP53 muta-
tions form the nexus of the worst prognostic 
group in AML and MDS. These data suggest an 
alternative up-front strategy for the treatment of 
this group of ultra-high-risk patients that will 
need to be verified in prospective trials. Decita-
bine as a single agent is not a cure for anyone 
with these diseases: the rapid selection of resis-
tant subclones by decitabine and the incomplete 
clearance of leukemia-specific mutations (even 
in patients who have a response) explain why 
remissions are generally short-lived. However, the 
use of decitabine may be an important way to 
induce clinical remissions in patients with AML 
who have TP53 mutations and who have disease 
that is notoriously resistant to induction therapy 
with standard cytotoxic chemotherapy. Such ther-
apy may also provide a bridge to allogeneic stem-
cell transplantation for some patients.

Figure 4 (facing page). Correlation between Clinical 
Variables and Survival.
Panel A shows the rate of overall survival among 116 
patients as a function of responses to decitabine. CR/
CRi/mCR denotes complete remission, complete remis-
sion with incomplete count recovery, or morphologic 
complete remission; PR/SD partial response or stable 
disease; and PD/NA progressive disease or not assessed. 
Panel B shows the correlation between karyotype and 
the presence of TP53 mutations. Panel C shows the rate 
of survival among 114 patients with karyotypes associ-
ated with unfavorable risk or with karyotypes associated 
with either intermediate risk or favorable risk. (Karyotype 
data were not available for 2 patients.) Panel D shows 
the rate of survival among patients with TP53 mutations 
and patients with wild-type TP53. Panel E shows the 
rate of survival among 116 patients according to wheth-
er they had undergone allogeneic stem-cell transplanta-
tion. Half the patients received a conditioning regimen 
of fludarabine and busulfan, a third received fludarabine 
and melphalan, and the others  
received busulfan and 
cyclophosphamide, cladribine and melphalan, or fluda-
rabine and total-body irradiation. No differences in survival 
were noted on the basis of the conditioning regimen. 
Panel F shows the rate of survival among patients who 
underwent allogeneic stem-cell transplantation accord-
ing to the type of TP53 mutation. P values were calcu-
lated with the use of pair-wise Wilcoxon analysis (Panels 
A and F) and log-rank analysis (Panels C through E).
