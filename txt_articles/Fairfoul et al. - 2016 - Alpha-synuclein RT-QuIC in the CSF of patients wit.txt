Abstract
We have developed a novel real-time quaking-induced conversion RT-QuIC-
based assay to detect alpha-synuclein aggregation in brain and cerebrospinal
fluid from dementia with Lewy bodies and Parkinson’s disease patients. This
assay can detect alpha-synuclein aggregation in Dementia with Lewy bodies and
Parkinson’s disease cerebrospinal fluid with sensitivities of 92% and 95%,
respectively, and with an overall specificity of 100% when compared to Alzhei-
mer and control cerebrospinal fluid. Patients with neuropathologically con-
firmed tauopathies (progressive supranuclear palsy; corticobasal degeneration)
gave negative results. These results suggest that RT-QuiC analysis of cere-
brospinal fluid is potentially useful for the early clinical assessment of patients
with alpha-synucleinopathies.
Introduction
Alpha-synuclein (a-syn) is well conserved, small acidic
protein of 140 amino acids, and a molecular weight of
19 kDa that is encoded by the SNCA gene located on
chromosome 4.1 It is located in high concentration in the
presynaptic nerve terminals within the central nervous
system where it plays a role in synaptic vesicle biology.2
The synucleinopathies are a set of neurodegenerative dis-
orders associated with the deposition of fibrillary aggre-
gates of a-syn within selective populations of neurons and
glia. These deposits can be found within neuronal soma
as Lewy bodies (LB) or in dystrophic neurites in diseases
such as Parkinson’s disease (PD) or dementia with Lewy
bodies (DLB), or in glial cytoplasmic inclusions in multi-
ple system atrophy (MSA).3

 The presence of a-syn has been detected in biological
fluids such as cerebrospinal fluid (CSF)4 and serum.5 The
measurement of a-syn concentrations in CSF by ELISAs
has been proposed as a biomarker for a-syn-related disor-
ders. However, despite many studies showing a reduction
in CSF a-syn levels in PD and in DLB,4,6 overall results
are not consistent.7 Even in those studies where a reduc-
tion in CSF a-syn has been demonstrated, the differences
are small8 and there is considerable overlap within patient
groups and between patient and control groups. In addi-
tion
the standardization
of CSF a-syn measurement
between laboratories has proven difficult.9
The aggregation properties of a-syn have recently been
compared to prion protein, the aggregation of which
causes
transmissible
spongiform
encephalopathies
(TSEs).10 Indeed, there is much discussion in current lit-
erature as to whether the alpha-synucleinopathies are
actually prion-like diseases.11 A recently described tech-
nique called real-time quaking-induced conversion (RT-
QuIC), which exploits the ability of prion protein to
induce self-aggregation, has been used to develop a diag-
nostic CSF test for sporadic Creutzfeldt–Jakob disease
(sCJD), the most common human form of TSE.12 Using
our expertize in RT-QuIC,12 we have developed and
tested a similar assay for the detection of a-syn in CSF.
Materials and Methods
Real-time quaking induced aggregation for
alpha-synuclein
The RT-QuiC reaction buffer (RB) was composed of
100 mmol/L phosphate buffer (pH 8.2), 10 lmol/L thio-
flavin T (ThT), and 0.1 mg/mL human recombinant
full-length (1–140 aa) alpha-synuclein (Stratech, Cam-
bridge, UK). Each well of a black 96-well plate with a
clear bottom (Nalgene Nunc International, Fisher Scien-
tific Ltd, Loughborough, UK) contained 98 lL, 90 lL,
or 85 lL RB (depending on volume of seed added) and
37 � 3 mg of 0.5 mm zirconium/silica beads (Thistle
Scientific Ltd, Glasgow, UK). Reactions were seeded with
2 lL
of
working
strength
brain
homogenate,
5 lL,
10 lL or 15 lL, of undiluted CSF to a final reaction
volume of 100 lL. The plates were sealed with a plate
sealer film (Fisher Scientific Ltd) and incubated in a
BMG OPTIMA FluoSTAR plate reader at 30°C for
120 h with intermittent shaking cycles: double orbital
with 1 min shake (200 rpm), 14 min rest. ThT fluores-
cence measurements (450 nm excitation and 480 nm
emission) were taken every 15 min. Each sample was
run in duplicate, allowing two negative control samples
(reactions seeded with SD and AD brain homogenate),
one positive control (reaction seeded with DLB brain
homogenate), an unseeded reaction, and 44 CSF samples
to be tested on one plate.
Patient groups
Initial phase of CSF RT-QuIC development was carried
out on 99 CSF samples obtained from the OPTIMA
cohort (Oxford Project to Investigate Memory and Age-
ing) with clinically and neuropathologically confirmed
diagnosis of pure DLB (n = 12), PD (n = 2), progressive
supranuclear palsy (PSP) (n = 2), corticobasal degenera-
tion (n = 3), DLB with AD pathology (n = 17), AD with
incidental LBs (n = 13), pure AD (n = 30), and controls
(n = 20). OPTIMA initiated in 1988, is a prospective,
longitudinal clinico-pathological study of dementia and
aging including CSF collection at multiple time points
during clinical follow-up. All clinical and pathological
protocols have been described in detail13 and were
approved by the local ethics committee and participants
provided informed consent prior to enrollment.
The validation phase of RT-QuIC was carried out on
CSF samples (20 PD, 15 controls, and 3 at-risk) obtained
from
the
Oxford
Discovery
cohort
(http://opdc.med
sci.ox.ac.uk) which is one of the largest, clinically best-
characterized longitudinal PD cohorts to date. Full clinical
details of this cohort have been described previously.14 In
brief,
patients
with
idiopathic
PD
diagnosed
within
3.5 years according to UK PD Society Brain Bank diag-
nostic criteria15 were recruited between September 2010
and September 2014 from a 2.9 million population (ethics
study 10/H0505/71). Mean disease duration among 20 PD
patients was 1.6 � 1.1 years (range 0.1–3.2 years) and
Hoehn and Yahr stage 1.9 � 0.4 (range: 1–3, maximum
possible score 5). The control population was recruited
from spouses and friends of patients taking part in the
study, as well as the general public. The at-risk group
comprised patients with REM sleep behavior confirmed
on overnight polysomnography,16 80% of which have
shown to develop Lewy body disorder over time.17 Demo-
graphic information is given in Table 1.
Brain homogenates
Brain tissue was provided by the MRC Brain Bank in the
NCJDRSU (ethical license 11/ES/0022). All tissue was fro-
zen at �80°C within 2 h of being sampled and stored at
�80°C prior to analysis. Brain tissues had been stored
between 2 and 18 years prior to use.
Frontal cortex tissue was taken from patients with Alz-
heimer’s disease (AD), sporadic Creutzfeldt–Jakob disease
(sCJD), and diffuse Lewy body dementia (DLB). In addi-
tion, frontal cortex was obtained from individuals without
neurodegenerative disease from the MRC Sudden Death

 Brain and Tissue Bank (Sudden Death [SD] controls).
Both frontal cortex and substantia nigra tissue was
obtained from patients with mixed AD/DLB, mixed
sCJD/DLB, and mixed AD/PD. All cases used had been
examined histologically and the diagnosis reached using
internationally accepted criteria.18 Initial 10% w/v brain
homogenates were prepared using phosphate-buffered sal-
ine
(PBS)
containing
1 mmol/L
EDTA,
150 mmol/L
NaCl, 0.5% Triton X, and complete protease inhibitor
cocktail from Roche. Subsequent working strength BHs
were prepared by diluting the above 1:20,000 with PBS.
Cerebrospinal fluid samples
CSF was drawn from patients by lumbar puncture and
samples with visible red color were excluded to avoid blood
contamination. A total quantity of 15 mL of CSF was col-
lected in 20 mL polypropylene tubes and samples were
stored on ice until centrifuged for 5 min at 1300g at 4°C to
remove cellular components. The supernatant was then
divided into 1 mL aliquots stored in polypropylene cry-
otubes and frozen at �80°C for long-term storage, prior to
analysis. Although all CSF samples with visible red col-
oration were excluded from RT-QuIC analysis in this study,
experiments were undertaken to show that a-syn RT-QuIC
analysis is not inhibited or falsely elevated in samples con-
taining red cell concentrations of up to 1250 9 106/lL.
Ninety-nine CSF samples from the OPTIMA cohort
and 38 CSF samples from the Oxford Parkinson’s Disease
Centre (OPDC) Discovery study were received from the
Nuffield Department of Clinical Neurosciences, University
of Oxford. All CSF samples were transported from Oxford
to Edinburgh on dry-ice and stored at �80°C on arrival.
In addition, CSF samples from patients with neuropatho-
logically confirmed sCJD or DLB from the NCJDRSU
CSF Bank were analyzed. Ethical approval for the use of
CSF samples from the NCJDRSU CSF Bank was covered
by Multi-centre Research Ethics Committee for Scotland
05/MRE00/67. All CSF were spun and stored at �80°C
prior to analysis.
Results
The development of RT-QuIC was undertaken using
frontal cortex BH from patients with a clinico-pathologi-
cal diagnosis of DLB, Alzheimer’s disease (AD), and
sCJD. Patients with no neuropathological evidence of
neurological disease who died suddenly and were part of
the MRC Sudden Death brain bank were used as controls
(SD) (Fig. 1A). The RT-QuIC reactions seeded with BH
from DLB had a lag phase of 50 h, after which an
increasing thioflavin T fluorescent signal was seen that
became maximal at 70 h. None of the reactions seeded
with brain homogenates from patients with other protein
misfolding disorders (AD or sCJD) or the SD controls,
gave a positive response even after 120 h.
Many disease pathologies commonly coexist, especially
AD-related and a-syn pathology.19 To investigate whether
the presence of an alternative protein misfolding disorder
can interfere with the a-syn aggregation induced by either
DLB or PD, brain homogenates from the frontal cortex of
patients with mixed pathologies were examined (Fig. 1B).
The presence of second protein misfolding disorders such as
AD or sCJD does not inhibit the RT-QuIC reaction induced
by DLB or PD brain homogenates (Fig. 1A and B). To
investigate whether the RT-QuIC method developed was
sensitive enough to detect a-syn in CSF, two CSF samples
from patients with neuropathologically confirmed DLB
and one CSF from a neuropathologically confirmed case
of sCJD were analyzed (Fig. 1C). Both CSF samples from
the DLB patients gave positive responses with a lag phase
between 60 and 100 h.
An exploratory set of 99 in vivo CSF samples obtained
as part of the OPTIMA study from patients with subse-
quent neuropathologically confirmed disease were ana-
lyzed at three different volumes (i.e., 5, 10, and 15 lL) to
investigate the sensitivity and specificity of the RT-QuIC
and to calculate the optimal CSF volume for the analysis
(Table 2). Using a volume of 15 lL, a sensitivity of 92%
was obtained for CSF samples from DLB (Fig. 1F and G)
and a sensitivity of 65% was obtained for CSF samples
from patients with mixed DLB/AD pathology. None of
the CSF samples from the control subjects (Fig. 1D) or
patients with pure AD (Fig. 1E), corticobasal degenera-
tion (CBD), or PSP were positive. Using this exploratory
set of CSF samples, a positive response was defined as a

The second phase of the study was to apply these ana-
lytical conditions and cutoff criteria to a set of confirma-
tory in vivo CSF samples from 20 patients with clinically
diagnosed PD, 15 control patients and three patients with
REM sleep behavior disorder (RBD) recognized to be at
high risk of developing future alpha-synucleinopathies,17
obtained from the large prospective, OPDC Discovery
cohort.17 These CSF samples were coded, analyzed, and
reported without prior knowledge of the final diagnosis.
After the samples were decoded, the results showed that
19 of the 20 PD patients had a positive RT-QuIC
response (Fig. 1H) and none of the 15 controls were
found to be positive. This resulted in
a RT-QuIC
sensitivity and specificity for PD of 95% and 100%,
respectively (Table 2). Interestingly, all three patients at-
risk of developing PD had a positive RT-QuIC response.
These patients had RBD, of whom 80% have been shown
to progress to develop a Lewy body disorder.17
Discussion
The early diagnosis of both DLB and PD is hampered by
the lack of sensitive and reliable clinical diagnostic tests.
Both conditions are underpinned by the neuropathologi-
cal deposition of an aggregated form of a-syn which is
released into the CSF. We have exploited the ability of
the aggregated a-syn to induce further aggregation of
nonaggregated a-syn in a cyclic manner to develop a tech-
nique that can detect abnormal CSF a-syn in DLB and

 PD with a sensitivity of 92% and 95%, respectively, with
100% specificity. Uniquely, we found that three RBD
patients at high future risk of developing a Lewy body
disorder gave a positive RT-QuIC response, suggesting
that this test could be used as an early diagnostic test for
prodromal PD. Future work focusing on test validation in
a larger cohort of RBD patients, followed by ongoing lon-
gitudinal assessment, will test the assay’s utility in risk
stratifying those prodromal individuals most at risk of
early PD conversion in whom neuroprotective therapies
might be trialed. We also found that CSF samples from
CBD and PSP patients do not give positive RT-QuIC
responses. These are movement disorders associated with
abnormalities in tau protein rather than a-syn which may
be mistaken for PD in the early stages. Therefore, RT-
QuIC offers a new approach for the detection of abnor-
mal a-syn and one which has the potential to improve
the early clinical diagnosis of PD and DLB in addition to
other alpha-synucleinopathies such as MSA.
