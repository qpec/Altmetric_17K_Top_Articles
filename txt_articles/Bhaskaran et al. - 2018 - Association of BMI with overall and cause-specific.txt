Association of BMI with overall and cause-specific mortality: 
a population-based cohort study of 3·6 million adults in 
the UK
Krishnan Bhaskaran, Isabel dos-Santos-Silva, David A Leon, Ian J Douglas, Liam Smeeth
Summary
Background BMI is known to be strongly associated with all-cause mortality, but few studies have been large enough 
to reliably examine associations between BMI and a comprehensive range of cause-specific mortality outcomes.
Methods In this population-based cohort study, we used UK primary care data from the Clinical Practice Research 
Datalink (CPRD) linked to national mortality registration data and fitted adjusted Cox regression models to examine 
associations between BMI and all-cause mortality, and between BMI and a comprehensive range of cause-specific 
mortality outcomes (recorded by International Classification of Diseases, 10th revision [ICD-10] codes). We included 
all individuals with BMI data collected at age 16 years and older and with subsequent follow-up time available. Follow-
up began at whichever was the latest of: start of CPRD research-standard follow up, the 5-year anniversary of the first 
BMI record, or on Jan 1, 1998 (start date for death registration data); follow-up ended at death or on March 8, 2016. 
Fully adjusted models were stratified by sex and adjusted for baseline age, smoking, alcohol use, diabetes, index of 
multiple deprivation, and calendar period. Models were fitted in both never-smokers only and the full study population. 
We also did an extensive range of sensitivity analyses. The expected age of death for men and women aged 40 years at 
baseline, by BMI category, was estimated from a Poisson model including BMI, age, and sex.
Findings 3 632 674 people were included in the full study population; the following results are from the analysis of 
never-smokers, which comprised 1 969 648 people and 188 057 deaths. BMI had a J-shaped association with overall 
mortality; the estimated hazard ratio per 5 kg/m² increase in BMI was 0·81 (95% CI 0·80–0·82) below 25 kg/m² and 
1·21 (1·20–1·22) above this point. BMI was associated with all cause of death categories except for transport-related 
accidents, but the shape of the association varied. Most causes, including cancer, cardiovascular diseases, and 
respiratory diseases, had a J-shaped association with BMI, with lowest risk occurring in the range 21–25 kg/m². For 
mental and behavioural, neurological, and accidental (non-transport-related) causes, BMI was inversely associated 
with mortality up to 24–27 kg/m², with little association at higher BMIs; for deaths from self-harm or interpersonal 
violence, an inverse linear association was observed. Associations between BMI and mortality were stronger at 
younger ages than at older ages, and the BMI associated with lowest mortality risk was higher in older individuals 
than in younger individuals. Compared with individuals of healthy weight (BMI 18·5–24·9 kg/m²), life expectancy 
from age 40 years was 4·2 years shorter in obese (BMI ≥30·0 kg/m²) men and 3·5 years shorter in obese women, and 
4·3 years shorter in underweight (BMI <18·5 kg/m²) men and 4·5 years shorter in underweight women. When 
smokers were included in analyses, results for most causes of death were broadly similar, although marginally 
stronger associations were seen among people with lower BMI, suggesting slight residual confounding by smoking.
Interpretation BMI had J-shaped associations with overall mortality and most specific causes of death; for mental and 
behavioural, neurological, and external causes, lower BMI was associated with increased mortality risk.

Introduction
High BMI contributed to an estimated 4 million deaths 
globally in 2015.1 Several major studies and meta-analyses 
have found strong associations between BMI and all-
cause mortality; most have described a U-shaped 
association with minimum mortality in the healthy 
weight (20–25 kg/m²) range;2–5 a 2013 meta-analysis 
suggested that overweight might be protective6 but 
concerns were raised about whether the study had 
adequately accounted for age, reverse causality, and 
confounding by smoking.7 A recent large meta-analysis, 
which explored the effect of different methodological 
decisions on results, observed a higher nadir of the BMI–
mortality curve when studies with short follow-up 
(and thus increased susceptibility to reverse causality) 
were included, and when ever-smokers were included.2
There is less evidence about the associations between 
BMI and cause-specific mortality outcomes. Among

studies investigating cardiovascular mortality, increased 
BMI has generally been associated with increased risk,4,5,8,9 
but it is unclear whether risk begins to increase with 
overweight5 or only with obesity,10 and whether under-
weight affects risk.4,9 U-shaped or J-shaped associations 
have been found between BMI and all-cancer mortality4 
but there is evidence of variation by cancer site based 
on studies looking at a range of site-specific cancers.11 
Drawing out patterns from existing evidence is com-
plicated by variation in study settings and populations; in 
analytical strategy, including inclusion and exclusion of 
smokers, inclusion and exclusion of early follow-up time, 
and handling of pre-existing disease; and in the range and 
granularity of outcomes considered.
We aimed to examine in detail the association of BMI 
with all-cause and cause-specific mortality outcomes 
using a large, single, contemporary, population-based 
cohort. We applied a consistent approach to minimise 
reverse causality and residual confounding. We also 
investigated effect modification by key individual-level 
characteristics and estimated absolute effects of BMI on 
mortality outcomes.
Methods
Study design and setting
We did a cohort study using prospectively collected data 
from the UK Clinical Practice Research Datalink (CPRD) 
linked to national death registration data. The CPRD 
contains primary care records from general practitioners 
(GPs) covering around 9% of the UK population; linkage 
to death registration data, including the date and causes 
of death, was available for 80% of GP clinics in England. 
CPRD data, including the linked subset, have been 
shown to be broadly representative of the general 
population in terms of age, sex, ethnicity, and BMI.12–15
The study protocol was approved by the London School 
of Hygiene & Tropical Medicine Ethics Committee (14389) 
and the Independent Scientific Advisory Committee for 
MHRA Database Research (protocol number 16_174, 
approved Aug 24, 2016, and provided in the appendix).
Participants, exposures, and outcomes
We included all individuals with BMI data collected at 
age 16 years and older and with subsequent follow-up 
time available; BMI data were processed as described 
Research in context
Evidence before the study
Two meta-analyses published in 2016 reviewed studies of 
associations between BMI and all-cause mortality. The first 
found a J-shaped association with lowest risk at a BMI of 
23–24 kg/m² among never-smokers. Inclusion of smokers and 
people with existing but undiagnosed illnesses were identified 
as important potential sources of bias. The second, by the 
Global BMI Mortality Collaboration, was an individual patient 
data meta-analysis and found a similar pattern, largely 
consistent across four continents. In the absence of any broad 
systematic reviews examining the association of BMI and 
cause-specific mortality outcomes, we searched PubMed for 
articles published in the past 10 years (Jan 1, 2007, to 
Dec 31, 2017) and retrieved 67 studies that investigated 
associations between BMI (as a continuous variable or in at 
least three categories) and one or more cause-specific mortality 
outcomes. The search string was (“body mass index” OR bmi OR 
obes*OR overweight) AND (mortality OR death); inclusion and 
exclusion criteria are listed in the appendix. The 67 included 
studies are described in the appendix; deaths from 
cardiovascular disease, cancer, and respiratory disease were 
most often studied, whereas only a small number of studies 
investigated deaths from other causes—namely, diabetes, 
external causes, liver or digestive diseases, kidney diseases, and 
infectious diseases. Only six studies investigated four or more 
of these categories of causes. Findings for cause-specific 
mortality outcomes from studies based in European, 
North American, Australian, and trans-continental settings 
(probably the most comparable to our data) are summarised in 
the appendix. Positive or J-shaped associations were observed 
for most cardiovascular disease mortality outcomes; 
associations between BMI and cancer mortality were smaller 
overall but varied by cancer site; inverse or U-shaped 
associations were reported for respiratory deaths, and for other 
outcomes there was limited evidence. Analogous results from 
30 studies in Asian settings are also summarised in the 
appendix.
Added value of this study
To the best of our knowledge, this is one of the largest single 
cohort studies of its kind to date that quantifies the 
associations between BMI and a comprehensive range of 
mortality outcomes at three levels of granularity, including 
several outcomes for which few previous data are available. 
We built on previous evidence by using flexible spline models to 
examine non-linearity in detail, and we also investigated 
potential effect modification. We used consistent methodology 
throughout to minimise confounding and reverse causality, 
and did extensive sensitivity analyses.
Implications of all the available evidence
Important associations exist between BMI and almost every 
category of mortality outcome. In contrast with some previous 
evidence suggesting that overweight might be protective, 
we found that risk began to increase above 21–25 kg/m² for 
most outcomes, including all-cause mortality, cardiovascular 
disease, and cancer. However, for mental and behavioural, 
neurological, and external causes, only lower BMI was 
associated with increased risk. We found strong evidence of 
effect modification by age; further work is needed to explore 
the drivers of this effect and thus understand whether healthy 
weight recommendations might need to take age into 
consideration.

elsewhere.12 Exposure was assigned as the earliest BMI 
recorded during CPRD research-standard follow-up 
(appendix);14 in the absence of BMI recorded at the start 
of follow-up, we used the most recent historical BMI 
record (if available) and updated it at the date of the first 
BMI during follow-up.
To minimise reverse causality (disease leading to 
weight change), we excluded the first 5 years of follow-
up after the BMI record. Follow-up began at whichever 
was the latest of: start of CPRD research-standard 
follow-up, the 5-year anniversary of the first BMI record, 
or on Jan 1, 1998 (start date for death registration data);

Data are n (%), mean (SD), or median (IQR). *Among 575 249 obese individuals, 405 005 (70·4%), had obesity class 1 (BMI 30–34·9 kg/m²), 121 891 (21·2%) had obesity class 2 
(BMI 35–39·9 kg/m²), and 48 353 (8·4%) had obesity class 3 (BMI ≥40 kg/m²). A further breakdown of these characteristics by sex as well as BMI category is given in the appendix. 
Characteristics are at the time of the first BMI record used in study where applicable; smoking was assigned by use of the record from same date as the BMI record or within 1 year 
before where available (for 3 000 050 [83%] patients), or by use of the nearest record in year after the BMI record (160 790 [4%]), or by use of the nearest record >1 year before the 
BMI record (285 817 [8%]), or by use of the nearest record >1 year after the BMI record (160 427 [4%]); a similar algorithm was used for alcohol; for ethnicity, the earliest available 
record was used.

We used a three-level hierarchical classification of causes of death as used by the Global Burden of Diseases, Injuries, and Risk Factors Study.16 All Level 1 outcomes (communicable diseases, 
non-communicable diseases, and injuries and external causes) were studied. 5-year exclusion period applied for person-time and events after a BMI record. Dashed vertical lines represent WHO BMI 
category thresholds of 18·5 kg/m² (underweight to healthy), 25 kg/m² (healthy weight to overweight), and 30 kg/m² (overweight to obese). Estimates adjusted for age at BMI record, deprivation, 
calendar year, diabetes, alcohol status, and smoking (all as defined at date of BMI measure) and stratified for sex. The p values for overall association and p values for non-linearity were less than 
0·0001 for all outcomes, in both full and never-smoker populations. HR=hazard ratio.

Risk Factors Study.16 We studied all Level 1 outcomes 
(communicable diseases, non-communicable diseases, 
and injuries and external causes); all Level 2 non-
communicable disease outcomes (high-level disease 
groupings such as cancer and cardiovascular disease), 
and selected Level 3 outcomes (specific disease and 
injury types, such as lung cancer and heart failure) that 
were either common causes of death in the UK,17 or 
were a priori expected to have important associations 
with BMI (the full list of outcomes with ICD codes is 
provided in the appendix). 
Statistical analysis
Cox regression models with an age timescale were fitted 
for all-cause mortality and for each cause-specific 
mortality outcome, censoring deaths from competing 
causes.18 BMI was initially fitted in WHO categories,19 
then in finer BMI categories as used by the Global BMI 
Mortality Collaboration (to aid comparison with work 
based on this classification),4 and then as a restricted 
cubic spline (smooth curve). Fully adjusted models 
were stratified by sex and adjusted for baseline age, 
smoking, alcohol use, diabetes, index of multiple 
deprivation (a measure of socioeconomic status20), and 
calendar period. We excluded individuals with missing 
smoking status (n=25 373 [0·7%]) or alcohol status 
(n=244 848 [6·7%]). Further details about parametri-
sation of covariates are provided in the appendix. 
Simpler linear or piecewise-linear models were next 
fitted for the Level 1 and Level 2 outcomes to quantify 
associations: where there was evidence of non-linearity, 
a two-line piecewise linear model with a single change 
point was estimated by trying all possible values for the 
change point and choosing the value with highest 
likelihood.
We fitted interactions to investigate effect modification 
by sex, current age, smoking, index of multiple 
deprivation quintile, and (among those with available 
data) ethnicity. To quantify absolute effects, we esti-
mated the expected age of death for men and women 
aged 40 years by BMI category using a simplified 
Poisson model including BMI category, age, sex, and 
interactions between these variables. Age 40 years was 
chosen as this was the approximate median age at entry 
and there were few deaths at younger ages; full details 
of the methods are provided in the appendix. Population 
attributable fractions were calculated by combining 
hazard ratios (HRs) from the nine-category BMI model 
with observed deaths in each BMI category.21 Cumulative 
incidences of mortality from cardiovascular disease, 
cancer, neurological causes, and respiratory causes 
were also calculated by BMI category by use of 
competing risks methods.18
Sensitivity analyses
First, we varied the amount of initial follow-up time after 
the BMI record that was excluded between 0 years and 
10 years; in the primary analysis the first 5 years were 
excluded to minimise reverse causality. Second, we 
excluded individuals with prevalent cancer or cardio-
vascular disease at the start of follow-up for those 
respective mortality outcomes, to further explore possible 
reverse causality; we also excluded individuals with 
previous chronic obstructive pulmonary disorder from 
the 
respiratory 
mortality 
analysis; 
dementia 
or 
Alzheimer’s disease from the neurological mortality 
analysis; and depression, bipolar disorder, or schizo-
phrenia from the analyses of deaths from mental and 
behavioural causes and from self-harm and interpersonal 
violence. Third, we considered alternative non-linear 
parametrisations of BMI—namely, very fine categories of 
1 kg/m² width (18·0–18·9 kg/m², 19·0–19·9 kg/m², and 
so on), and a two-term fractional polynomial.22 Fourth, 
we adjusted for ethnicity where such data were available. 
Fifth, we dropped adjustment for diabetes, then excluded 
patients with diabetes entirely, in case diabetes might act 
as an intermediary. Sixth, we dropped BMIs recorded 
before the start of research-standard CPRD follow-up. 
Seventh, we restricted the analysis to patients who had a 
BMI record less than 12 months after registration (more 
likely because of administrative reasons rather than 
clinically motivated). Finally, we explored the effect of

Figure 2: Association between BMI and Level 2 and Level 3 cause-specific mortality outcomes among never-smokers (organised by ICD-10 code)
We used a three-level hierarchical classification of causes of death as used by the Global Burden of Diseases, Injuries, and Risk Factors Study.16 We studied all Level 2 non-communicable disease 
outcomes and selected Level 3 outcomes that were either common causes of death in the UK or were a priori expected to have important associations with BMI. 5-year exclusion period applied for 
person-time and events after a BMI record; estimates adjusted for age, deprivation, calendar year, diabetes, alcohol status (all as defined at date of BMI measure) and stratified for sex. HR=hazard ratio.

missing BMI by restricting analyses to more recent 
calendar periods in which BMI completeness was 
higher.
Role of the funding source
The sponsor had no role in study design, data collection, 
data analysis, data interpretation, or writing of the 
report. The corresponding author had full access to all 
the data in the study and had final responsibility for the 
decision to submit for publication.
Results
Of data from 8 093 746 individuals from CPRD practices 
in England, 3 632 674 were included in the study after 
excluding data from individuals with no linked mortality 
data, BMI data, or BMI data outside of the plausible 
range (15–50 kg/m²), and from individuals followed up 
for less than 5 years after BMI measure (appendix). Of 
individuals included in the study, 1 969 648 were never-
smokers. 367 512 deaths were observed (188 057 among 
never-smokers; table 1; appendix). A positive association 
was observed between age and BMI (median age 25 years 
in underweight individuals, 33 years in healthy-weight 
individuals, 42 years in overweight individuals, and 
43 years in obese individuals), in keeping with expected 
trends;23 70·3% of underweight individuals were women, 
whereas 56·1% of obese individuals were men (table 1).
Associations between BMI and mortality were J-shaped 
for all-cause, communicable, and non-communicable 
disease mortality. For injuries and external causes, a 
marked increase in risk was observed at low BMIs, but 
minimal elevation in risk at higher BMIs (figure 1). 
Restriction to never-smokers slightly attenuated the 
association at low BMIs for all these outcomes (figure 1) 
and also for cancer mortality (appendix). The nadir for 
all-cause mortality risk among never-smokers was 
estimated from piecewise linear models to be at a BMI 
of 25 kg/m² (table 2).
Estimated associations between BMI and more specific 
mortality outcomes are shown from non-linear spline 
models (figure 2) and from linear and piecewise linear 
models (table 2) in never-smokers (analagous results in 
the full study population including smokers are provided 
in the appendix). For 11 of 13 Level 2 mortality outcomes, 
there was evidence of non-linearity, with two main pat-
terns seen: for eight outcomes (cancer, cardiovascular, 
respiratory, blood/endocrine, liver cirrhosis, other diges-
tive, musculoskeletal, and urogenital causes), we 
estimated the mortality risk to reach a nadir at BMIs in 
the range of 21–25 kg/m², with inverse associations 
below, and positive associations above, although the 
magnitude of associations varied; for three outcomes 
(mental and behavioural, neurological, and accidental 
[non-transport-related]), we found inverse associations 
below a BMI of 24–27 kg/m², with little evidence of 
association at higher BMIs. We estimated a linear inverse 
association between BMI and deaths from self-harm and 
interpersonal violence (HR 0·87 per 5 kg/m² increase; 
95% CI 0·80–0·94); we found no evidence of association 
between BMI and deaths from transport-related 
accidents.
The overall pattern of association between BMI and 
cardiovascular death was similar for most Level 3 cardio-
vascular outcomes but was more muted for cerebro-
vascular deaths (figure 2). Broadly positive associations 
were observed between BMI and 12 of 15 site-specific 
cancer mortality outcomes, with evidence of non-linearity 
for oesophageal, stomach, uterus, prostate, and kidney 
cancers, generally reflecting a weak association at the 
lowest BMIs, although for oesophageal cancer there was 
a J-shaped association. BMI was not associated with 
deaths from lung cancer, brain or CNS cancer, or 
malignant melanoma.
Results from categorical BMI models are in the 
appendix.
High BMI was more strongly associated with overall 
and cardiovascular mortality in men than in women 
(figure 3; appendix). Most associations between BMI and 
mortality were attenuated at older ages (figure 3; 
appendix). In a post-hoc analysis we estimated the nadir 
of all-cause mortality risk to be 23 kg/m² at age younger 
than 70 years, rising to 25 kg/m²  at age 70 years and

older. We found no evidence of effect modification by 
deprivation (appendix). Investigation of effect modifi-
cation by ethnicity was limited by low power and we only 
considered all-cause mortality; despite some difference 
in the observed patterns by ethnicity, particularly at low 
BMI, there was insufficient evidence to rule out chance 
variation (appendix).
The expected age of death for a 40-year-old never-
smoker with healthy weight was 82·2 years for men and 
84·3 years for women (table 3). Underweight, overweight, 
and obesity were all associated with reductions in these 
life expectancies: obesity overall was associated with 
shortening of life expectancy by 4·2 years in men and by 
3·5 years in women; class 3 obesity was associated with 
shortening of life expectancy by 9·1 years in men and by 
7·7 years in women.
Assuming causality, we estimated that 4·3% of all 
deaths might be attributable to obesity, and 5·5% to 
overweight including obesity (appendix). Cumulative 
incidences of cause-specific mortality outcomes by BMI 
are shown in the appendix.
Exclusion of more initial follow-up time attenuated 
inverse associations at low BMI for most outcomes; 
exclusion of prevalent disease gave similar results to 
exclusion of early person-time (appendix). Other 
sensitivity analyses made little difference to estimated 
associations between BMI and mortality (appendix).
Discussion
We observed a J-shaped association between BMI and all-
cause mortality, with lowest mortality at 25 kg/m². BMI 
was associated with mortality risk from every main 
category of cause except for transport-related accidents. 
There were three broad patterns of association: for 
cancer, cardiovascular, respiratory, blood and endocrine, 
digestive, musculoskeletal, and urogenital causes of 
death, we found J-shaped associations with nadirs at 
21–25 kg/m², and varying magnitudes of association; for 
mental and behavioural, neurological, and accidental 
(non-transport-related) causes, BMI was inversely 
associated with mortality up to 24–27 kg/m² with little 
association above this point; and BMI was inversely and 
linearly associated with deaths from self-harm and 
interpersonal violence. Associations between high BMI 
and several mortality outcomes attenuated with age and 
were stronger in men than in women. Obesity was 
associated with a 4·2-year reduction in remaining life 
expectancy for a male 40-year-old never-smoker and a 
3·5-year reduction for a female 40-year-old never smoker, 
when compared with individuals of healthy weight, with 
longest reductions in life expectancy estimated for the 
most severely obese (class 3) individuals; underweight 
was associated with a reduction in life expectancy of 
more than 4 years.
The J-shaped association we observed between BMI 
and all-cause mortality was consistent with results from 
some major studies,2,4 but others have estimated a 
reduced risk among overweight individuals compared 
with those of healthy weight.6 Reverse causality and 
residual confounding (in particular by smoking) might 
partly explain the discrepant results between studies; 
associations between overweight and mortality are 
attenuated in studies with short follow-up, or in studies 
that include smokers.2 We also observed clear hetero-
geneity in the associations between BMI and different 
causes of death, and strong interactions with age, 
meaning that the association of all-cause mortality with 
BMI in any individual study will be affected by the age 
and cause-of-death distributions in the source population.
In the absence of broad evidence summarising cause-
specific mortality outcomes, we did a systematic literature 
review and identified 67 relevant studies from 2007 to 2017 
for comparison (appendix). Most studies either excluded 
an initial follow-up period of 1–10 years (n=20) or excluded 
people with previous disease (n=11), or excluded both 
(n=13). Most studies of overall cardiovascular mortality 
from similar settings found approximately J-shaped 
associations, consistent with our results (appendix); only a 
few examined more specific cardiovascular mortality 
outcomes. J-shaped associations were similarly seen for 
deaths from coronary heart disease and heart failure, and, 
in some studies, for cerebrovascular deaths;4,5 however, 
more modest associations between BMI and cerebro-
vascular death were also observed, as in the present 
analysis.24 Ischaemic and haemorrhagic stroke were rarely 
distinguished, despite their potentially different associa-
tions with BMI.5 Most previous evidence about cancer 
mortality has focused on any cancer type or on breast, 
colorectal, lung, and prostate cancers, with less common 
cancers infrequently studied (appendix). Studies into 
prostate cancer mortality generally imposed linearity or 
used few BMI categories; our results suggest important 
non-linearity in the association, with a levelling off or 
reduction in risk at the highest BMIs. Various studies 
agreed with our finding of no association between BMI

Expected age of death at age 40 years estimated from a Poisson model for overall survival with six-category BMI 
variable, 5-year age bands, sex, and interaction terms for BMI with age at BMI, and BMI with sex (see appendix for 
details); estimates assume mortality observed in the study remains constant. Reduction in life expectancy is calculated 
as expected age of death minus expected age at death in the healthy weight category.

and lung cancer mortality, whereas others found both 
strong positive and negative associations, possibly 
reflecting the complications of adequately accounting for 
smoking. Few studies looked at mortality outcomes other 
than those from cardiovascular disease and cancer 
(appendix).
The raised risks of many outcomes at low BMI, coupled 
with the fact that mental health conditions showed the 
strongest inverse associations with low BMI, might 
indicate pervasive effects of mental health problems on a 
range of outcomes, through pathways that could include 
poorer self-care and less access to or use of health-care 
services, or both. The persistence of inverse associations 
between BMI and deaths from self-harm and inter-
personal violence even in sensitivity analyses in which 
follow-up was started up to 10 years after BMI recording, 
or when individuals with previously recorded mental 
illness were excluded, argues against reverse causality. 
However, it remains possible that depression and related 
diseases leading to appetite suppression even over a long 
time period or without a formal diagnosis could partly 
explain this finding. Imposing a longer period between 
BMI recording and study entry tended to attenuate 
associations between low BMI and outcomes; this might 
have been observed because a side-effect of this approach 
is to reduce the amount of person-time included at young 
ages, and we separately found the strongest associations 
between low BMI and mortality to be in younger people. 
The analyses stratified by age also suggested that 
mortality was minimised in older individuals at higher 
BMI, perhaps indicating increased importance of 
nutritional reserves in older age. This finding might 
suggest that healthy weight recommendations need to 
account for age, but further work is needed to establish 
whether increased weight is actually beneficial for older 
individuals: there is increased risk of reverse causation in 
older people because of the increased prevalence of most 
diseases, and BMI might be compromised as a measure 
of adiposity in the oldest individuals because of 
complications from loss of muscle mass.25
In this study, we systematically analysed outcomes 
at different levels of granularity, used consistent 
methodology to deal with confounding and reverse 
causality, and did a wide range of sensitivity analyses. 
A particular strength was that the size of the study 
allowed us to retain power while restricting analyses to 
never-smokers and thus minimising confounding by 
smoking. BMI data in the CPRD have good validity and 
representativeness.12 
In 
preliminary 
analyses, 
we 
validated linked mortality data by comparing these with 
data recorded directly in primary care records; dates of 
death agreed to within 1 month in 97% of cases.
25% of individuals who were otherwise eligible were 
excluded because they had no BMI records available. 
This complete case analysis approach is valid provided 
that absence of data is conditionally independent of the 
outcome under study;26 we considered this approach 
more appropriate than multiple imputation, because 
underweight and overweight individuals would be 
more likely to have their BMI recorded in primary 
care, contradicting the required missing at random 
assumption.27 Several sensitivity analyses suggested that 
missing BMI data had little effect on our estimates: there 
was little change in results when analyses were restricted 
to more recent calendar years, despite BMI data com-
plete 
ness increasing from 66% to 80% in 2000–15. There 
might have been inaccuracies in cause of death recording. 
Different physicians could differently interpret the 
underlying cause of death, and certification of deaths in 
hospital could be completed by one of several doctors in a 
team, increasing the risk of classification errors.28 Some 
causes of death might be particularly prone to 
misclassification: we noted a relatively large number of 
deaths attributed to pneumonia, which might have been 
secondary to other morbidities. Clear national guidance 
about certification should have helped reduce errors.28 If 
any mis 
classification was unrelated to BMI, the expected 
impact on our analysis would be loss of power. We might 
also have missed deaths that were not registered in the 
UK because of emigration, but these are likely to 
represent a small proportion of deaths. We had no data 
about diet, physical activity, or cardiorespiratory fitness, 
with which we could have further explored causal 
pathways and confounding,29,30 and we had no data about 
measures of adiposity other than BMI.
In conclusion, BMI had a J-shaped association with 
overall mortality, and BMI outside the healthy range was 
associated with up to several years of lost lifespan, with 
most of the absolute mortality burden driven by obesity 
(BMI ≥30 kg/m²). However, the overall association 
between BMI and mortality was driven by varying 
associations with individual cause-specific mortality 
outcomes, including predominantly inverse associations 
for mental and behavioural, neurological, and external 
causes. Associations between BMI and mortality varied 
by age; an improved understanding of the reasons for 
this interaction could help inform age-specific public 
health recommendations.
