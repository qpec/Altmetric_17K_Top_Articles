The use of personal continuous glucose monitoring (CGM) has expanded dramatically among in-
dividuals with diabetes. CGM systems provide retrospective data, as well as the current glucose value
and trend arrow data, which indicate the direction and velocity of changing glucose. In 2017, Aleppo and
colleagues developed a simplified approach for adults with diabetes to safely adjust rapid-acting insulin
doses using trend arrow information in the Dexcom G5 CGM system. Since then, the FreeStyle Libre
and FreeStyle Libre 14-day CGM systems have become available in the United States; however,
guidance on using trend arrow data that take the unique features of these systems into consideration is
lacking. Specifically, the FreeStyle Libre systems do not have automatic alarms, which impact how the
system and trend arrow data are used. The Endocrine Society convened an expert panel to address this
gap and develop an approach to adjusting rapid-acting insulin doses for adults using trend arrows in the
FreeStyle Libre systems. We based our approach on previous work and expanded upon engagement and
scanning recommendations, and we incorporated pre-exercise planning specific to these systems. Our
approach provides insulin dose adjustments as discrete insulin units based on an individual’s insulin
sensitivity and directionality of the trend arrow. We focus on the needs of patients treated with multiple
daily injections because these individuals currently make up a greater proportion of individuals on
intensive insulin therapy. Our recommendations are intended to provide a safe, practical approach to
using trend arrows in the FreeStyle Libre systems.

 CGM provides information that can be critical for safe and effective diabetes management.
Unlike fingerstick monitoring, which measures glucose at a single point in time, CGM
displays the immediate glucose value within the context of both prior glucose data and,
importantly, the direction and velocity of changing glucose using trend arrows. Real-time
information allows patients to react immediately to mitigate or prevent acute glycemic
events. Retrospective review of CGM data in combination with standardized data man-
agement tools such as the ambulatory glucose profile [4, 5] help clinicians and patients fine-
tune management strategies.
One of the newest CGM systems available in the United States is the FreeStyle Libre flash
glucose monitoring system (FreeStyle Libre system; Abbott Diabetes Care, Alameda, CA),
often referred to as flash CGM or intermittently scanned CGM. The system received US Food
and Drug Administration clearance in September 2017 for nonadjunctive use in adults (age
18 years and older) with diabetes. The FreeStyle Libre 14-day flash glucose monitoring
system (FreeStyle Libre 14-day system; Abbott Diabetes Care) was more recently approved
by the US Food and Drug Administration with the same indications but with a longer wear
time and shorter warm-up period that is comparable to systems available in Europe (Table 1).
The nonadjunctive indication allows patients to calculate insulin doses based on current
sensor value using individual insulin dosing parameters, target glucose concentration, and
trend arrow information.
Large randomized controlled trials demonstrated that use of the FreeStyle Libre system
resulted in significant reductions in hypoglycemia, increased time in target range, reduced
glycemic variability, and greater patient satisfaction compared with fingerstick monitoring
[6, 7]. These benefits were seen in well-controlled type 1 diabetes (T1D) [6] as well as
suboptimally controlled type 2 diabetes (T2D) treated with intensive insulin therapy [7].
Studies also showed high device utilization, suggesting that the FreeStyle Libre system may
enhance patient engagement [6, 7]. Smaller observational and prospective studies have also
shown improvements in both A1c and a reduction in hypoglycemic events [8–10].
Although research provides compelling evidence of the benefits of the FreeStyle Libre
system, there is sparse guidance for what actions individuals should take based on the trend
arrow data. The purpose of this article is to provide safe, practical guidance on the use of trend
arrow data in the FreeStyle Libre and FreeStyle Libre 14-day systems—collectively called
the FreeStyle Libre systems unless denoted otherwise—in the United States for clinicians
and their patients on intensive, rapid-acting insulin therapy. Current sensor warm-up and
wear time in US-approved systems has been an iterative process that has resulted in closer
alignment between systems approved in the United States and beyond. Our hope is that this
better alignment of systems will improve access and utility, but we note differences outside
the United States in patient indications (systems are available to children as young as 4 years
of age and to women during pregnancy) as well as interface options (systems may use the
mobile LibreLink application on a compatible smart device to scan the sensor). We focus on
the US-approved systems, recognizing the differences in patient indications and interface
options in the FreeStyle Libre systems available outside the United States.
Our approach is based on the recently published guidance by Aleppo et al. [11], which
focused on a different CGM system (Dexcom, San Diego, CA). We have modified our approach
to account for these differences. Specifically, we address that the FreeStyle Libre systems do
not have automatic alarms or double up and double down trend arrows, which are present in
the Dexcom systems. We developed our approach to be applicable to any patient with diabetes
treated by intensive insulin therapy who is using continuous subcutaneous insulin infusion
(CSII) or multiple daily injections (MDIs). However, we focus on the needs of patients treated
with MDIs because these individuals currently make up a greater proportion of T1D and T2D
populations on intensive insulin therapy. Additionally, our approach is based on the an-
ticipated changes in individuals using rapid-acting insulin analogs for prandial and cor-
rection insulin doses. Our approach is not intended for individuals using more recently
available ultra–rapid-acting insulins, which have reduced insulin action times and may affect
rate of glucose change differently. We also incorporate our clinical experiences, our personal

 experiences as people living with diabetes and using CGM, and guidance from other
diabetes specialists.
1. FreeStyle Libre Flash Glucose Monitoring System
A. System Overview
The FreeStyle Libre systems use two components: a disposable sensor that is inserted into
the user’s upper arm and a separate handheld touchscreen reader device used to scan and
retrieve CGM glucose readings. Following sensor insertion, the FreeStyle Libre 10-day
system has a 12-hour warm-up period until the reader is able to retrieve sensor glucose
readings. The system is factory calibrated, which eliminates the need for daily calibration
during the 10-day wear time (Table 1). Similarly, the FreeStyle Libre 14-day system is factory
calibrated, but it has a 1-hour warm-up period and 14-day wear time.

 When the reader is swiped close to the sensor in either system, the sensor glucose data are
transmitted to the reader. The reader displays the current glucose concentration and the
most recent 8 hours of sensor glucose readings, as well as trend arrow data when present.
When .8 hours occur between scans, only the last 8 hours of data are reported. Importantly,
the system lacks automatic alarms. Therefore, patients must be actively engaged in scanning
because they will not receive automatic alarms in the event of hypoglycemia or hypergly-
cemia, as is the case with other CGM systems.
B. Trend Arrows
The system measures glucose concentrations every minute and, when scanned, transmits the
current glucose reading and historical glucose readings in 15-minute increments to the reader. The
trend arrows are calculated from glucose readings with an emphasis on the most recent 15 minutes.
The directionality of trend arrows allows individuals to anticipate future glucose concentrations.
This additional information can be used proactively to adjust therapy and prevent hypoglycemia or
hyperglycemia. For individuals on intensive insulin therapy, upward trend arrows indicate rising
glucose concentrations and may suggest a need for additional rapid-acting insulin. Downward
trend arrows indicate falling glucose concentrations and may suggest a need for less rapid-acting
insulin or carbohydrate ingestion to avoid hypoglycemia. Flat arrows indicate that glucose con-
centrations are changing very slowly and that therapy adjustments are probably not needed if in
the target range. Figure 1 provides an example of how these trend arrows appear in the FreeStyle
Libre system and the anticipated glucose change they represent.
C. Scanning Frequency
Although, there are no “hard and fast” rules for scanning frequency, large clinical studies
have shown that the glycemic benefits of the FreeStyle Libre system use were achieved at
mean scanning frequencies ranging from 8 times per day in patients with T2D [7] to 15 times per
day in patients with T1D [6]. However, scanning at any frequency has been associated with
clinical benefit, and an analysis of real-world data from 50,831 users revealed a mean of 16.3 scans
per day, suggesting that this scanning frequency is reasonable among most users [12]. The
Figure 1. Trend arrows in the FreeStyle Libre systems. The FreeStyle Libre systems
present trend arrow data as icons on the reader. Trend arrows indicate rates of glucose
change (mg/dL per min) and can be described as the anticipated glucose change. Notably, the
flat arrow does not indicate no change in sensor glucose readings. The flat arrow indicates
steady glucose values with a change of ,1 mg/dL per min. For individuals using the
FreeStyle Libre systems, more frequent scanning may be warranted to monitor for
hypoglycemia when a flat arrow is present and sensor glucose is near the low end of the
target range. In general, anticipated glucose may be less accurate when trying to predict
changes over extended periods of time (e.g., beyond 20 to 30 min) due to the many factors
that may influence glucose concentrations. Conversion: mg/dL 3 0.0555 = mmol/L.

 recommendations for scanning frequency presented in Table 2 are based on our clini-
cal judgment and personal experiences using the FreeStyle Libre system in a clinical
setting.
2. Approach to Using Trend Arrows in the FreeStyle Libre Systems to Adjust
Insulin Doses
In 2017, Aleppo et al. [11] published recommendations for using trend arrows with the
Dexcom G5 CGM system in adults. Those recommendations were based on review of four
previously published methods to adjust insulin doses using trend arrows: the DirecNet
Applied Treatment Algorithm [13], the Scheiner method [14], Pettus and Edelman method
[15], and the Klonoff and Kerr equation [16]. We have modified those recommendations to
accommodate the features and functionalities of the FreeStyle Libre systems.
Our approach may be applied to any patient with diabetes treated by intensive insulin
therapy. Our recommendations are applicable to both CSII and MDI therapy; however, we
focus mainly on trend arrow use with patients treated with MDIs, who comprise more than
half of the T1D population [17] and a growing number of patients with T2D [18].
Recognizing that many patients treated with MDIs may be unfamiliar with CGM use, we
have endeavored to make our method as simple and intuitive as possible. Because adjusting
insulin dose using trend arrows adds a layer of complexity, we recommend patients wait until
they are comfortable with the general application of CGM data and learn how their body
responds to various meals (quantity/composition) and physical activity before adjusting
insulin dose using trend arrows. Safe and effective use of the FreeStyle Libre systems re-
quires that patients have a basic understanding of how to use their current glucose value,
target glucose value, food intake (if any), and insulin dosing parameters to calculate their

Systems (Continued)

 insulin doses. Importantly, the approach relies on the accurate determination of insulin-to-
carbohydrate ratio and correction factors as insulin dose parameters.
A. Mealtime Insulin Calculation
Figure 2 outlines our method for adjusting insulin doses at meal time and at least 4 hours
after a meal, using trend arrows. The method utilizes a simple approach to insulin dose
calculation: Total premeal insulin dose = food 6 correction 6 arrow adjustment. Patients
would calculate their rapid-acting insulin dose for food and correction, and then add or
subtract insulin based on the trend arrow.
The insulin dose adjustment recommendations are based on typical insulin sensitivity ranges for
adult patients as determined by Aleppo et al. [11]. Similarly, we offer an insulin dose adjustment in
insulin units for each insulin sensitivity range. In this manner, insulin adjustments can be simply
added to or subtracted from standard calculations. The adjustments also take into consideration
the limitations of 0.5-U increment minimums for individuals treated with MDI with significant
insulin sensitivity. Although 0.5-U increment insulin pens are generally reserved for use in highly
insulin-sensitive patients, it is not uncommon for adults with T1D to also be insulin sensitive, and
use of 0.5-U increment insulin pens can be a practical tool for diabetes management [19]. Al-
ternatively, adult patients using 1.0-U increments can round the total insulin dose, including food,
correction, and adjustment, to the closest full unit.
Because the previous approach determined by Aleppo et al. focused on the Dexcom G5 system,
which includes double up and double down trend arrows that correspond to .3 mg/dL per minute
rate of glucose change, we modified our guidance to accommodate the FreeStyle Libre systems,
which do not have double up or double down trend arrows. Specifically, we retained the same
adjustment value as Aleppo et al. for the single up and single down trend arrows rather than
increase the suggested insulin dose adjustment to account for a lack of double up and double down
trend arrows. We think this is a safe approach to using trend arrows in the FreeStyle Libre systems,
which lack automatic alarms. Based on clinical experience and a study by Kovatchev et al. [20], we
also think that the time spent at .3 mg/dL per minute is relatively infrequent in the absence of food
intake or exercise, for which we offer specific guidance. In this manner, we think our suggested
approach provides a safe starting point for individuals seeking to use trend arrows in the FreeStyle
Libre systems to reduce glycemic variability. It is important to differentiate MDIs from CSII when
using trend arrows; for instance, CSII users may need to adjust insulin dose more conservatively
when they are using temporary basal rates to address trend arrows following mealtime. Table 3
presents sample scenarios that demonstrate how the approach can be used.
Our approach to adjusting insulin dose is not intended to replace standard care in the event of a
missed insulin dose for meals. In this case, it is standard practice to calculate the insulin dose based
on the carbohydrate ingested, CGM value, and CGM trend arrow at the time of the meal. Adjusting
insulin doses using trend arrows should also be avoided in cases of underestimating carbohydrate
intake from a previous meal (i.e., miscalculations) and overcorrecting for hypoglycemia with fast-
acting carbohydrate. At these times, the trend arrows can play an important role as indications to
patients of a missed dose or a miscalculation. For other unplanned situations, more specific
strategies for the use of trend arrows should be established between patients and their health
care providers.
B. Postmeal Monitoring (2 to 4 Hours After Meal)
We also include an approach to postmeal monitoring and treatment in adults based on the
guidelines used in the REPLACE-BG trial, which suggested a method to minimize hypoglycemia
and hyperglycemia during the 4 hours following a meal [21]. Figure 3 outlines the approach that
can be used by both patients treated with MDIs and patients treated with insulin pumps.
As a general rule, we recommend caution when adjusting insulin dose using trend arrows during
the4 hours following a meal due to the many variables (e.g., meal composition, total calories, physical
activity/exercise, insulin on board) that affect rate of glucose change during this time. Notably, our
1326 | Journal of the Endocrine Society | doi: 10.1210/js.2018-00294
Downloaded from https://academic.oup.com/jes/article-abstract/2/12/1320/5181247 by guest on 03 June 2019
 approach assumes the use of rapid-acting insulin. More recently available ultra–rapid-
acting insulins may also affect rate of glucose change during this time. Individuals using
ultra–rapid-acting insulin should take caution when considering our postmeal approach.
Importantly, patients should be cautioned to wait at least 2 hours after a meal-time bolus
before taking any corrective action (e.g., standard corrections based on correction factor or
insulin dose adjustments using trend arrows).
Figure 2. Insulin dose adjustments for adults using trend arrows in the FreeStyle Libre
systems. Our recommended approach to adjusting insulin dose using trend arrow data in the
FreeStyle Libre systems assumes that the patient has insulin-requiring diabetes, is using
rapid-acting insulin for meals and correction, and is using insulin-to-carbohydrate ratio (ICR)
and correction factors (CFs) that have been optimized as much as possible. The approach is
based on anticipated glucose change and typical insulin sensitivity ranges in adults. The
approach utilizes a simple approach to insulin dose calculation: Total insulin dose = food 6
correction 6 arrow adjustment. It provides adjustments in terms of insulin units over
the range of insulin sensitivities to minimize additional calculations. It is generally
recommended to start adjusting conservatively and at mealtime to understand how the
recommendations impact individual glucose responses. Adjusting the insulin dose using
trend arrows does not replace but, rather, adds to standard calculations using ICR and CFs.
Importantly, a single arrow up may require additional corrections due to unknown velocity of
glucose increase (e.g., .2 mg/dL). The CF (in mg/dL) indicates glucose lowering per unit of
rapid-acting insulin. Conversion: mg/dL 3 0.0555 = mmol/L.

 3. Engaging Your Patients
Optimal use of the FreeStyle Libre systems requires that patients and clinicians become
actively engaged with utilizing CGM data in both real-time decision-making and retro-
spective analysis. Real-time decision-making refers to patients actively using their CGM data
to make insulin dosing decisions to achieve desired glycemic control and prevent or mitigate
acute glycemic events. Retrospective analysis refers to review of historical CGM data to
identify glucose patterns that may indicate a need for therapy adjustment and/or changes
in behaviors.
A. Real-Time Decision-Making
The FreeStyle Libre systems require patients to make a conscious effort to obtain glucose
data with periodic scanning. As such, patients need guidance regarding when and how often
to scan based on their current glucose and trend arrows (see Table 2). However, monitoring is
not managing. Patients also need guidance about what they should do with the information
they obtain and, importantly, they need to be empowered to make changes when needed.
These measures will enhance patients’ confidence in the device and their ability to avoid
acute glycemic events and effectively manage their diabetes.
B. Retrospective Analysis
Use of retrospective CGM data by patients and clinicians is equally important. Patients can use
built-in reader reports (e.g., Glucose Pattern Summary or Weekly Summary) and detailed in-
formation downloaded via the LibreView software to see the effects of their current activities (e.g.,

 insulin dosing, exercise, meal amounts/composition) and adjust their behaviors accordingly. Im-
portantly, patients should be encouraged to use retrospective analysis to evaluate glucose vari-
ability, the reasons behind glycemic excursions, and whether they are spending more time in target
range without hypoglycemia. Each clinician and patient will have to individualize the type of data
they look at to personalize their therapy and/or behavioral measures.
Reflection is also valuable to evaluate an individual’s use of trend arrow adjustments,
scanning frequency, and level of patient engagement. When patients make frequent ad-
justments for trend arrow data and/or hyperglycemia and hypoglycemia events, it may be an
indication that their current treatment plan or insulin parameters are inaccurate and need
modification. It may also indicate the need for further education in insulin management and/
or diabetes self-management behaviors.
4. Special Considerations When Using the FreeStyle Libre Systems
Insulin dosing decisions during special circumstances are complex and multifactorial and
may be impacted by food intake, physical activity, and stressors among other factors. These
areas are of great concern and our suggestions should serve as a starting point for future
discussion on how our suggested approach may apply. In particular, bedtime insulin dose
decisions and potential nocturnal hypoglycemia are common concerns impacted by several
factors, particularly when patients engage in intensive physical activity during the day. Our
approach to insulin dose adjustments may be considered at bedtime; however, patients
should use caution when adding insulin to calculated correction insulin doses at that time.
Additional guidance during other special circumstances is provided.
A. Sick Day Management and Medication Considerations
During illness, there is increased risk of glucose instability that can lead to severe hypo-
glycemia, hyperglycemia, and diabetic ketoacidosis. Use of the FreeStyle Libre systems likely
offers some benefit in patients with acute illness, but special precautions must be considered.
Based on our clinical experience, we recommend more frequent scanning and suggest that
individuals consider insulin correction every 2 to 3 hours with appropriate ketone monitoring
during illness. Additionally, patients should consider using fingerstick monitoring for treat-
ment decisions when glucose is .250 mg/dL and ketones (blood or urine) are present and when
glucose is ,70 mg/dL or symptoms of hypoglycemia are present.
A confirmatory fingerstick may be required when high doses of salicylic acid and/or ascorbic acid
are used, which is more likely to occur during sick days. Salicylic acid (used in aspirin and other
pain relievers) at doses $650 mg may cause falsely lower glucose values, and ascorbic acid (vitamin
C) at doses $500 mg may cause falsely higher readings. At lower doses, salicylic acid and ascorbic
acid are known to have minimal effect on sensor glucose readings in the FreeStyle Libre systems.
mealtime bolus. During the 4 h following mealtime bolus, individuals needing corrective
active should rely on current sensor glucose and predetermined CF and ICR values.
Importantly, the approach relies on the accurate determination and use of insulin-to-
carbohydrate ratio (ICR) and correction factors (CFs) as insulin dose parameters. Individuals
should not rely on insulin dose adjustments using trend arrow data during this time. The
following is based on the protocol used in the REPLACE-BG study [21] and has been
modified to account for the unique features of the FreeStyle Libre system and includes
observed trend arrows for the FreeStyle Libre systems. In general, individuals should avoid
taking corrective action by bolus insulin dose within the first 2 h after eating. Insulin
stacking is a primary concern during this time. Beyond 4 h, it is assumed that most, if not
all, carbohydrate has entered the system and that there is no active bolus insulin on board.
In this case, the authors recommend using the trend arrows for dose adjustment (Fig. 2). The
CF (in mg/dL) indicates glucose lowering per unit of rapid-acting insulin. Conversion: mg/
dL 3 0.0555 = mmol/L.

 B. Young Adults
In the United States, the FreeStyle Libre systems are approved for all adults $18 years of
age; however, there are distinct differences between younger and older adults that should be
considered when initiating CGM in patients within these age groups. As reported by Miller
et al. [22], achieving adequate glucose control among younger adults with T1D remains
problematic. Moreover, early CGM studies with older CGM devices found that CGM ad-
herence among patients ,21 years of age was suboptimal [23].
The FreeStyle Libre systems’ ease of use, scanning reminders, low-profile sensor, and
absence of alarms offer distinct advantages for younger adult patients. Nevertheless,
finding ways to motivate patients and sustain their engagement with CGM is paramount
when initiating CGM use in younger adults. It is important that clinicians have frank
discussions with their younger adult patients to identify and resolve barriers to sustained
use. It is also important that patients receive adequate training in using their CGM data to
make appropriate adjustments, when needed. Guidance about when to scan and how to use
trend arrows in treatment decisions is essential. Based on clinical experience, clinicians
should de-emphasize “the numbers” and emphasize “staying flat within the lines,” with a
focus on minimizing glycemic variability. This will facilitate more positive, supportive
discussions with patients that focus on achieving desired glycemic control.
C. Elderly and Frail Adults
Elderly patients with diabetes are at a notably higher risk for severe hypoglycemia and its
ramifications due to age, duration of diabetes, and greater prevalence of hypoglycemia
unawareness [24–28]. The increased risk is compounded by cognitive and physical im-
pairments and other comorbidities. Hence, it is important to start conservatively when using
our approach to adjust insulin doses using trend arrows.
In the older and frail diabetes populations, there is a tendency to relax A1c targets; however,
this clinical decision needs to be individualized based on recent epidemiologic data. For ex-
ample, severe hypoglycemia is common in T1D and to a lesser extent in adults with T2D with
both higher and lower A1c levels, although the relationship between A1c goal setting and
frequency of severe hypoglycemia in those individuals is less clear [29, 30]. Also, as discussed
earlier, use of the FreeStyle Libre system reduces hypoglycemia and hyperglycemia in both
well-controlled T1D [6] and poorly controlled insulin-treated patients with T2D [7], whereas
frequent fingerstick monitoring does not protect against severe hypoglycemia [28].
In short, rather than relax glycemic goals, we may instead strive to optimize the medi-
cations and self-management tools that are now available to create a stable glucose profile.
However, we recognize that there is a learning curve challenge with newer technology for
older patients and emphasize the value in ongoing patient education.
D. Exercise/Physical Activity
Glycemic responses to exercise and physical activity are complex and can be influenced by
multiple factors: type of diabetes; fitness level, timing/dose of last bolus; timing/content of last
meal; current glucose concentration; rate of changing glucose at start of exercise/activity; rate
of insulin infusion (insulin pump basal rate); insulin on board; and type, intensity, and
duration of exercise/activity [31]. Information about the impact of various types of exercise on
glycemia is presented in Table 4.
A suggested guide to using the trend arrow data prior to and during exercise in the
FreeStyle Libre systems is presented in Fig. 4. Our guide is not intended to be comprehensive,
and we recognize that numerous factors can influence glycemia prior to, during, and up to
8 hours or longer following exercise [31]. We strive to highlight the unique features of the
FreeStyle Libre systems to provide a starting point to individualize an exercise strategy for
individuals performing moderate aerobic exercise.

 E. Environmental Factors
There are no indications that environmental factors, such as extreme temperature, altitude,
or humidity, impact CGM accuracy, but they do affect fingerstick monitoring values [34].

5. Discussion
A large proportion of individuals with diabetes treated with intensive insulin therapy are not
achieving their glycemic goals [22, 35] and hypoglycemia remains a key obstacle to effective
diabetes management [36]. Today’s CGM devices, such as the FreeStyle Libre systems, can
help patients overcome obstacles and improve quality of life [6, 7, 12, 37]. However, moni-
toring glucose is only the first step in optimizing care; patients need to know how to use their
glucose data, including trend arrow information, to make informed decisions.
Our recommendations are intended to provide a safe, practical approach to using the
FreeStyle Libre systems, in general, and trend arrows, in particular. Our goal is to provide
guidance that facilitates individualized recommendations for trend arrow use and data
assessment. Our approach focuses on typical insulin sensitivity ranges used in adults and

 provides a range of adjustments in discrete insulin units. We believe this simplified ap-
proach reduces numeracy requirements and the number of calculations, which will help
patients improve glucose control and increase glucose time in range without hypoglycemia,
while promoting clinical discussion.
CGM has the potential to transform diabetes management. With this approach as a
starting point, we hope to address the needs of clinicians and the growing number of patients
using CGM seeking an approach to safely reduce glycemic variability using trend arrow data.
We also hope to see this approach applied in practice to derive empirically based information
for all currently available and emerging glucose monitoring devices.

Figure 4. Approach for pre-exercise/activity planning based on current glucose concentration
and trend arrow direction. The following recommendations are based on the consensus
statement by Riddell et al. [31] and our own clinical experience. Our pre-exercise planning
approach takes the unique features of the FreeStyle Libre systems approved in the United
States into consideration including the scanning requirement and trend arrow information.
In addition to the suggested planning steps, individuals should be aware of how they respond
to different types and/or durations of exercise and plan accordingly in advance of activities as
best as possible. In general, frequent scanning is recommended for individuals using the
FreeStyle Libre systems during exercise.
