Background: There has been increasing interest in the potential for pre-emptive interventions in the prodrome of
autism, but little investigation as to their effect. Methods: A two-site, two-arm assessor-blinded randomised
controlled trial (RCT) of a 12-session parent-mediated social communication intervention delivered between 9 and
14 months of age (Intervention in the British Autism Study of Infant Siblings-Video Interaction for Promoting
Positive Parenting), against no intervention. Fifty-four infants (28 intervention, 26 nonintervention) at familial risk
of autism but not otherwise selected for developmental atypicality were assessed at 9-month baseline, 15-month
treatment endpoint, and 27- and 39-month follow-up. Primary outcome: severity of autism prodromal symptoms,
blind-rated on Autism Observation Schedule for Infants or Autism Diagnostic Observation Schedule 2nd Edition
across the four assessment points. Secondary outcomes: blind-rated parent–child interaction and child language;
nonblind
parent-rated
communication
and
socialisation.
Prespecified
intention-to-treat
analysis
combined
estimates from repeated measures within correlated regressions to estimate the overall effect of the infancy
intervention over time. Results: Effect estimates in favour of intervention on autism prodromal symptoms,
maximal at 27 months, had confidence intervals (CIs) at each separate time point including the null, but showed a
significant overall effect over the course of the intervention and follow-up period (effect size [ES] = 0.32; 95% CI
0.04, 0.60; p = .026). Effects on proximal intervention targets of parent nondirectiveness/synchrony (ES = 0.33; CI
0.04, 0.63; p = .013) and child attentiveness/communication initiation (ES = 0.36; 95% CI 0.04, 0.68; p = .015)
showed similar results. There was no effect on categorical diagnostic outcome or formal language measures.
Conclusions: Follow-up to 3 years of the first RCT of a very early social communication intervention for infants at
familial risk of developing autism has shown a treatment effect, extending 24 months after intervention end, to
reduce the overall severity of autism prodromal symptoms and enhance parent–child dyadic social communication
over this period. We highlight the value of extended follow-up and repeat assessment for early intervention trials.

Introduction
Pre-emptive intervention in developmental disorder
A decade of prospective studies of infants at familial
risk of developing autism in the first 3 years of life
has made substantial advances towards a develop-
mental account of the emergence of autism, with
deeper understanding of the phenotype at brain as
well as behavioural level (Johnson, Gliga, Jones, &
Charman,
2015;
Szatmari
et al.,
2016).
These
advances, in turn, suggest possibilities for interven-
tion in the autism prodrome, targeting either the
earliest behavioural symptoms of emerging disorder
or those neurocognitive biomarkers that have pre-
dictive
salience
in
early
development
(Dawson,
2008). There is an appealing, but unproven, argu-
ment that very early intervention in these emergent
trajectories may be especially effective, with added
potential to exploit early brain system plasticity to
altered environmental input (Johnson, 2011).
Intervention of this kind can be seen in a wider
context of ‘prevention’ studies in mental health and
biomedicine, in which risk biomarkers are identified
as targets for a range of intervention strategies:
universal, targeted at a whole population group;

 selective, at individuals at high risk (HR) of a condi-
tion, or indicated, at those showing early symptoms
indicating predisposition but without meeting diag-
nostic criteria (O’Connell, Boat, & Warner, 2009).
Autism prevalence rates preclude the feasibility of
‘universal’
strategies,
and
selective
or
indicated
interventions are the basis of current work. But,
furthermore, the very aim of simple ‘prevention’ is
not now considered realistic or appropriate. Insel
(2007) coined the alternative term ‘pre-emptive inter-
vention’, suggesting a strategy to mitigate develop-
mental
risks
and
modify
prodromal
symptom
trajectories, rather than ‘eliminate’ a condition. We
use this latter term as reflecting the intent of our
work. In pre-emptive intervention, the combination of
a randomised controlled trial (RCT) of a theoretically
targeted intervention with repeated measures follow-
up can also be a powerful method of illuminating
causal processes in developmental science, and test-
ing predictive models alongside clinical effectiveness
(Howe, Reiss, & Yuh, 2002).
Apart from the Intervention in the British Autism
Study of Infant Siblings (iBASIS) study discussed in
this paper, the extant literature on early pre-emptive
autism spectrum disorder (ASD) studies in the first
year of infancy consists wholly of case-series (n = 3–8;
Bradshaw, Steiner, Gengoux, & Koegel, 2015). Some
are ‘selective interventions’ with infants at known
familial risk of autism (Green et al., 2013; Steiner,
Gengoux, Klin, & Chawarska, 2013), others are
‘indicated interventions’ with infants assessed as
having emergent atypicalities thought by the investi-
gators to be autism-related (although empirical evi-
dence of this is limited); for instance ‘early signs of
difficulty in relation to affect, social interest, eye
contact avoidance or response’ (Koegel, Singh, Koegel,
Hollingsworth, & Bradshaw, 2013) or ‘risk indicators’
including unusual patterns of attention, repetitive
behaviours or eye contact (Rogers et al., 2014). In the
second year, there are RCT studies that do still qualify
as indicated pre-emptive studies, as they sample
toddlers screening positive for autism-related atypi-
cality prior to diagnosis; all used forms of parent-
focussed intervention, with mixed results. A small
study at mean age 15 months (n = 16, Baranek et al.,
2015) reported endpoint findings on infant receptive
language (RL) and parent-reported socialisation, but
no long-term effects. A 3-month ‘Hanen’ group parent
training at mean 20 months (n = 62; Carter et al.,
2011) produced near-significant effect on parental
interaction but no child effects, although low baseline
object interest moderated better child outcome. A 3-
month therapist–parent coaching model at mean
21 months (Early Start Denver Model for parents,
n = 98; Rogers et al., 2012) had no effect on parent or
child variables despite increased parent–therapist
engagement; and a 3-month ‘focussed playtime inter-
vention’ at mean 22 months (n = 66; Kasari et al.,
2014) showed improved parent responsiveness but no
effect on child joint attention or social interaction.
Jones, Dawson, Kelly, Estes, and Webb (2017) have
recently published an infancy RCT (n = 33) of a parent
intervention with evidence of some positive effects on
infant neurophysiological markers.
Intervention within the British Autism Study of
Infant Siblings
The iBASIS trial was designed as a selective pre-
emptive trial; including infants at high familial aut-
ism-risk due to having a sibling with the condition, but
not otherwise selected on the basis of developmental
atypicality. The timing of the intervention was set
between 9 and 14 months when results from previous
studies suggest that early atypicalities at the brain and
cognitive level first emerge (Johnson et al., 2015;
Szatmari et al., 2016), when the parent–child interac-
tion context is central to infant social development
(Tomasello, 2008), and there is evidence of alterations
in parent–child interaction related to at-risk status. An
independent BASIS cohort study showed reduced
parental ‘responsiveness’ and ‘nondirectiveness’ with
7-month at-risk infants compared to low-risk controls
(Wan et al., 2012); at 14 months, these differences
continued, but were accompanied at that point by
decreasedinfantattentiveengagementtoparent, affect
sharing and mutuality; and these infant interactive
behaviours then predicted ASD emergence at 3 years
(Wan et al., 2013). Evidence that the 7-month effects
are associated with altered neurophysiological visual
social processing in the infant (Elsabbagh et al., 2014)
and that infant rather than parent interactional qual-
itiespredictlaterASDemergence,supporttheideathat
these observed interactional cycles are initially evoked
by an atypical infant development, but could then
feedback to alter the infant’s further social learning,
thus amplifying pre-existing vulnerability. This does
not imply primary parenting difficulties, but rather
that contingent responses are more challenging for
parents in the context of infant with atypical develop-
ment (Slonims, Cox, & McConachie, 2006). In clinical
terms, parent–infant interaction that is attuned and in
which the parent is able to ‘read’ the child’s commu-
nicative signals promotes positive social and commu-
nicative development in all children. Infants at-risk for
autism often show ‘weak’ or distorted communicative
signals which parents can struggle to recognise and
respond to accurately. The iBASIS intervention was
designed specifically to reverse such disrupted pat-
terns of early parent–infant interaction, with the
hypothesis that there would be consequent positive
effects on other infant developmental markers and
emerging prodromal autism symptoms.
Building on an initial case-series feasibility study
(Green et al., 2013), we tested the efficacy of the
time-limited (5 month), parent-mediated interven-
tion for 7- to 10-month-old infants (mean 9 months)
at familial high risk of autism in a two-site, two-arm
RCT of iBASIS against usual care (n = 54). The 15-
month treatment endpoint results (Green et al.,

There was significant increase in parent nondirec-
tiveness (ES = 0.81), the proximal target of the
parent-mediated intervention, but less clear impact
on child measures of child attentiveness, communi-
cation initiation and autism-related behaviours on
the Autism Observation Scale for Infants (AOSI;
ES = 0.50), which all showed positive point esti-
mates of effect but with CIs crossing the null. There
was an unexpected nonsignificant trend towards
negative effect on a range of receptive, expressive
language (EL) and communication scores.
The current study
The current manuscript extends these previously
reported findings in two principal ways. First, we
report, for the first time in the literature, data on
subsequent
planned
follow-up
to
age
27
and
39 months,
including
prodromal
autism-related
behaviours and clinical categorical diagnostic out-
come. Second, we report a longitudinal repeated
measures analysis that not only highlights the time-
paths of the effects of intervention, giving insight into
the possible therapeutic and developmental mecha-
nisms but also increases the statistical power to
sharpen effect estimates.
Method
Design
A two-site, single (rater)-blinded RCT of two parallel groups:
intervention and no intervention. Research assessments were
made at the Centre for Brain and Cognitive Development,
Birkbeck College, at pre-randomisation baseline (9 months),
following 5 months of intervention (15 months; Green et al.,
2015), and at 27- and 39-month follow-up. The London
Research Ethics Committee approved the study (Ref: 09/
H0718/14) and parents provided written informed consent.
This study is registered as ISRCTN 87373263 (http://www.
isrctn.com/); the trial protocol is available at http://www.bb
mh.manchester.ac.uk/ibasis/protocol/.
Allocation and masking
Details of the conduct of the trial and intervention are reported
in Green et al. (2015) and in the Supporting Information. All
assessments were administered and coded blind to other
information including group allocation, with the exception of
parent-rated measures of adaptive behaviour.
Participants
Siblings of autism probands were sampled within the context
of a prospective longitudinal observational study, the BASIS
(http://www.basisnetwork.org/)
and
age
7–10 months
at
baseline. Exclusion criteria were significant medical conditions
in infant, twinship, prematurity <34 weeks or birth weight
<5 lbs. Families were approached in order of identification,
and infants were not selected on the basis of developmental
characteristics or atypicality. Further details on participant
characterisation are given in the Supporting Information.
Intervention
The intervention was iBASIS-Video Interaction for Promoting
Positive Parenting (iBASIS-VIPP), a modification for the autism
prodrome of the VIPP infancy programme (Juffer, Bakermans-
Kranenburg, & Van IJzendoorn, 2008). The comparator group
had no planned intervention. iBASIS-VIPP uses video-feedback
to help parents understand and adapt to their infant’s
individual communication style to promote optimal social
and communicative development (Green et al., 2015 and
Supporting Information). Given the potential developmental
complexity of prodromal ASD, we adapted the original six-
session infancy VIPP programme and added up to six further
planned booster sessions according to need, plus procedures
to address any emerging developmental atypicality. The ther-
apist uses video excerpts of parent–child interaction in a series
of developmentally sequenced home-sessions focussing on:
interpreting the infant’s behaviour and recognising their
intentions, enhancing sensitive responding, emotional attune-
ment and patterns of verbal and nonverbal interaction. The
intervention was carried out in participant homes in Manch-
ester and London regions.
Measures
Primary outcome – autism prodromal symptoms.
Across different time points, we used two conceptually anal-
ogous measures of autism prodromal symptoms. The beha-
viours
measured
are
conceptually
continuous
with
ASD
symptoms after clinical diagnosis and we refer to them
therefore as ‘prodromal symptoms’, without suggesting that
all children showing them develop ASD.
The AOSI (Bryson, Zwaigenbaum, McDermott, Rombough, &
Brian, 2008), completed at 9-month baseline and 15-month
endpoint, is a semistructured observational assessment of
early autism-related behaviours that are risk markers for ASD
covering social reciprocity and imitation, and motor, attention
and sensory behaviours. AOSI total score in 14- to 18-month-
old infants is associated with later Autism Diagnostic Obser-
vation Schedule (ADOS) scores and with ASD diagnosis at
3 years (Brian et al., 2008; Gammer et al., 2015).
Autism Diagnostic Observation Schedule 2nd Edition (Lord
et al., 2012), completed at the 27- and 39-month assessments,
is a structured assessment of experimenter–child interaction,
which is used internationally as part of autism diagnostic
assessment. We report ADOS-2 combined social affect and
rigid and repetitive behaviours total score as a continuous
measure of emerging ASD symptomatology. Two trained raters
blind to treatment allocation (one administrator, one observer)
coded each observation and agreed a consensus code following
the assessment.
Secondary outcomes
Parent–child social interaction.
Two different concep-
tually related coding schemes were applied over the four time
points of the trial.
Manchester Assessment of Caregiver–Infant Child interac-
tion (MACI; Wan, Brooks, Green, Abel, & Elmadih, 2016; Wan
et al., 2013), is a global coding on 7-point scales from 6-min
videotaped free-play interaction. The infancy version of the
instrument was used at the 9- and 15-month assessment
points and the toddler version at 27 months. MACI was
designed to investigate the interactional antecedents of social
competency in infancy and early parent–infant atypicalities
in the autism prodrome. Based on previous work, two MACI
scales, caregiver ‘nondirectiveness’ and child ‘attentiveness to
caregiver’ were prespecified outcomes (for details see Support-
ing Information). Within-study independent coding (n = 11)
showed intraclass correlations (ICC; single measures, absolute

 agreement) of .75 for nondirectiveness and .84 for child
attentiveness.
The Dyadic Communication Measure for Autism (DCMA;
Aldred, Green, Emsley, & McConachie, 2012), at 27- and 39-
month follow-up, is an event coding of parent–child commu-
nication based on an 8-min sample of parent–child free play,
developed for preschool children diagnosed with autism. Two
DCMA scales were prespecified for outcome as the closest
analogues conceptually to MACI ‘caregiver nondirectiveness’
and ‘infant attentiveness’: ‘parental synchrony’ (the proportion
of parental communications that are contingently responsive
to the child) and ‘child initiations’ (the proportion of child
communications with the parent that are spontaneous com-
munication acts directed towards the parent, including non-
verbal indication and verbalisation/vocalisation). Both these
scales have shown sensitivity to intervention effects in trials of
parent-mediated intervention for autism in children from
2 years (Green et al., 2010; Rahman et al., 2016), and medi-
ation effects on ADOS symptom change (Aldred et al., 2012;
Pickles et al., 2015). Thirty-three (33%) of all videos across
both time points were independently double-coded, with ICC
(one-way random, single measures) .81 (p < .001) for parent
synchrony and .74 (p < .001) for child initiations. (For further
details of DCMA codings and the conceptual continuities
between MACI and DCMA coding constructs at each time
point, see Supporting Information.)
Developmental measures.
The Mullen Scales of Early
Learning (MSEL; Mullen, 1995) are a standardised develop-
mental assessment, examining early motor, language and
cognitive development, completed at 9, 15, 27 and 39 months.
RL, EL T-scores were analysed.
Vineland Adaptive Behavior Scales – 2nd Edition (Sparrow,
Cicchetti, & Balla, 2005), is a parent-report measure of
adaptive behaviour yielding age-normed standard scores on
communication and socialisation domains.
Clinical diagnosis.
At the 39-month time point, experi-
enced researchers (TC, GP, CC) reviewed 27- and 39-month
data on ASD symptomatology (ADOS-2; Autism Diagnostic
Interview-Revised; ADI-R; Lord, Rutter, & Le Couteur, 1994),
Social Communication Questionnaire (Rutter, Bailey, & Lord,
2003),
adaptive
functioning
(Vineland)
and
development
(MSEL) for each child, to ascertain diagnostic outcomes of: (i)
‘ASD’ using clinical best estimate consistent with DSM-5
criteria; (ii) ‘Atypical’ development through showing (a) ADOS
autism criteria alone, with or without ADI-R (Risi et al., 2006);
(b) greater than 1.5 SD below the population mean on the
Mullen ELC (<77.5) or on the Mullen EL or RL subscales (<35;
n = 5); or (c) criteria (a) plus (b); (iii) the remaining participants
were considered ‘typically developing’. (See Supporting Infor-
mation for further details).
Statistical analysis
The intention-to-treat analysis followed a statistical analysis
plan for the follow-up analysis, prespecified in outline at the
design stage (see trial protocol) and in final detail after the
initial 15-month data analysis but before unblinding the 27-
and 39-month data. The results presented follow the analysis
plan for the 39-month follow-up (additional results related just
to the 27-month analysis are also included in the Supporting
Information). A late revision was the replacement of ADOS-2
comparative severity score by a log-transformed ADOS-2 total
score analysed by regression, in order to allow a uniform ES
estimator (Cohen’s d) to be used across AOSI and ADOS in the
longitudinal analysis (see Results and Figure 2).
All analyses were undertaken in Stata 14 (StataCorp, 2015).
Combined analysis of the treatment effect estimates available
at trial baseline, 15, 27 and 39 months used seemingly
unrelated regressions (Zellner, 1962) estimated by maximum
likelihood using the sem procedure so as to include data from
all 54 participants, including those with incomplete records.
This method allows a set of treatment effect regressions to
have different error variances and different predictors but
nonetheless recognises that the regressions involve the same
participants and adjusts for their correlation. Combining
occasion-specific
estimates
of
treatment
effect
can
give
increased power, not least because it improves the reliability
of the posttreatment characterisation. A Cohen’s d ES for each
measure was calculated using the within-group standard
deviation of the outcome at each assessment occasion (also
within module for the 39-month ADOS-2). Each analysis
covaried for relevant baseline measure value, plus key pre-
specified variables of centre, age-at-assessment, mother’s
ethnicity and educational qualifications (imbalanced at fol-
low-up), and treatment group assignment. To summarise the
treatment group differences in a principled fashion, the
multiple point estimates were combined into an area between
the curves (sum of trapeziums, see Figures 2 and 3). A Wald
test for this estimated area was calculated from the individual
effect estimates and their parameter covariance using the
lincom procedure. CIs for area ESs were obtained by boot-
strap, resampling participants with replacement. Further
details of the analytic method are included in the Supporting
Information.
Results
Figure 1 shows the participant flow through the
whole study and Table 1 shows the summary statis-
tics for each assessment time point. Tables S1 and
S2 show baseline sample descriptive characteristics
and correlations across time points for each of the
seven sets of measures, respectively.
Autism prodromal symptoms
Figure 2A shows the jointly estimated point treat-
ment effects and CIs at each time point for autism
prodromal symptoms. The effects were close to
individual significance immediately following inter-
vention (15 months), and showed some evidence of
persistence beyond this point and across the change
of instrument from AOSI to ADOS-2. Combining the
estimates to form the overall area between curves for
the control and iBASIS-VIPP groups from the start of
therapy to 24 months after end of therapy showed a
significant ES in favour of intervention of 0.32 (95%
CI 0.04, 0.60; p = .03). Analysis of the effect on
autism prodromal symptom scores of dropping case-
wise (Figure S2) suggests that this treatment effect is
not driven by outliers or a subset of cases.
Diagnostic outcome
The intervention group showed 4/27 (15%) children
with clinical ASD outcome, 7/27 (26%) with atypical-
ity and 16/27 (59%) typical development. Noninter-
vention showed 2/26 (8%) ASD, 8/26 (31%) non-ASD
atypical
and
16/26
(62%)
typical
development
(Table 1). There was no intervention effect on autism
diagnostic outcome (2 by 3 Fisher’s exact p = .846;
ordinal logistic OR = 0.83, p = .726).

 attenuation; the overall ES was significant at 0.36
(95% CI 0.04, 0.68; p = .015). Once again, there was
no suggestion that outliers or a subset of cases drove
these effects (Figures S2b and S2c).
Developmental measures
Both Mullen language measures and the Vineland
communication
measure
show
a
nonsignificant
trend towards initial slowing in the intervention
group followed by a delayed trend towards benefit
(Figure 3). The overall effects over time are all
nonsignificant (all p > .88). For the (nonblinded)
parent-report Vineland social scale, the longitudinal
data have not clarified the initial suggestive early
nonsignificant gains. While estimates remain posi-
tive at both 27 and 39 months, they lack sufficient
stability to yield a significant overall effect (area
p = .171).
Discussion
We report on the follow-up to age 3 years of the first
randomised trial of a pre-emptive intervention with
infants at high familial risk of developing autism.
The intervention is of relatively moderate intensity
compared to some autism interventions (mean 9.5
sessions/family, range 6–11; Green et al., 2015);
meta-analysis of similar parent–infant psychosocial
interventions in nonautism contexts finds generally
better results from briefer interventions (Bakermans-
Kranenburg, van IJzendoorn, & Juffer, 2003). The
planned follow-up used a repeated measures design
to analyse the developmental trajectories for prespec-
ified outcomes.
For autism prodromal symptom severity, point
estimates of treatment effect reach a maximum at
27 months (10 months after treatment end) and
were less by 39 months. At each individual time
point, there was a lack of precision and 95% CIs
include the null. However, the averaged combined
estimate over time (using area under curve) shows a
significant positive overall treatment effect. We thus
demonstrate, to our knowledge for the first time, that
a very early intervention for at-risk infants has
produced a sustained alteration of subsequent child
developmental trajectory; reducing prodromal aut-
ism symptoms into the second and third years of life
to a total of 24 months following end of the inter-
vention.
Post hoc investigation of the developmental and
clinical significance of this result first suggests a
general effect across the whole cohort rather than on
a specific subgroup (Figures S2). This is consistent
with the intervention targeting early parent–infant
developmental interaction processes that are generic
across
typical
and
atypical
early
development:
although they show specific perturbation (and thus
theoretically a need for enhanced developmental
support) in this at-risk group. Second, while there
was
no
formal
typical
development
comparison
group within the trial, post hoc indexing of AOSI
and ADOS score severity in relation to ‘low-risk’ (LR)
infants with no familial risk of autism within the
longitudinal project from which the sample was
drawn (n = 27), suggested that baseline symptom
scores in the HR trial cohort were raised relative to
LR infants, and at follow-up endpoint, while the
nonintervention group remained elevated, the inter-
vention group had reduced ADOS scores into the LR
range (for details see Supporting Information).
The study was not powered to test for a treatment
effect on categorical autism outcome, and there is no
evidence for such an effect in the data. Trials in
larger cohorts would be necessary to give the power
to test whether improving these prodromal symp-
toms across the cohort could ever affect the amount
of categorical ASD outcome. The measurement of
categorical outcome is through a clinical best esti-
mate from triangulating multiple sources of infor-
mation, whereas that of the prodromal symptoms
relates to a continuous measure of severity on one
instrument. We do not have the data to inform
whether the lack of consistency between measured
effect on categorical outcome and symptom severity
relates to such measurement issues or sample size.
The
parent-mediated
iBASIS-VIPP
intervention
worked with parents to increase their awareness
and timing of response to infant communications.
The success of this strategy in iBASIS is marked by
the initial increase in parental ‘nondirectiveness’
within dyadic interaction (Green et al., 2015; Fig-
ure 2B). Other early interventions using similar
structured
video-aided
techniques
have
shown
improvements in the same or related parental inter-
action behaviours, in both autism (Green et al.,
2010; Kasari et al., 2014; Poslawsky et al., 2015;
Rahman et al., 2016) and nonautism (Juffer et al.,
2008) contexts. This gives persuasive support for the
efficacy of these video-aided methods and may relate
to the less predictable effect in parent interventions
that do not use this approach. The fall off in parental
change during follow-up may suggest a value for
phased ‘booster sessions’ for families in the second
or third years. Formal mediation tests in two related
studies (Aldred et al., 2012; Pickles et al., 2016)
show that such parental synchrony change mediates
child symptom changes. A larger sample would have
been necessary to test such mediation in iBASIS, but
this study does contribute follow-up data that show,
for the first time to our knowledge in an infancy study,
a sustained intervention effect from parent-mediated
intervention on child dyadic communication and
symptom outcomes, extending over 24 months after
treatment end. The intervention targeted precursors
of social competency (Tomasello, 2008), shown to be
disrupted in the autism prodrome (Wan et al., 2013);
the success of this intervention strategy suggests
therefore that, in this respect, autism atypicality is
responsive to similar processes as in neurotypical

 development. We reported at endpoint (Green et al.,
2015) a possible trend towards negative impact of the
intervention on early
language
development and
auditory neural sensitivity. This is not seen in the
follow-up
data,
where
the
pattern
across
both
assessed and reported language measures does not
suggest any effect (Figure 3A–C).
Methodological issues
The
‘area-between-therapies’
analysis
over
time
used here can be an efficient way to assess the
cumulative benefits of intervention in developmental
treatments (Pickles et al., 2016). In this paper, we
illustrate an extension of this approach to a com-
mon challenge in early development, where the
assessment instruments on which treatment differ-
ences are measured change as children grow older
during the trial. Our findings also have implications
for the design of future trials from infancy where
blind-assessment often necessitates video-coding of
interaction. With repeated assessments we are able
to reduce the variance due to measurement error,
increasing reliability and thus statistical power,
leading to greater clarity of findings and hopefully
replicability.
Strengths and limitations
The study used a manualised intervention, targeting
aspects of early development associated with later
autism (dyadic interaction and autism prodromal
symptoms) and embedded in a closely studied lon-
gitudinal cohort. It achieved a high rate of partici-
pant
follow-up
and
completion
of
blind-rated
assessments, within a prespecified, hypothesis-dri-
ven analysis that made efficient use of the repeated
measurement. A weakness of the study was the
relatively modest sample size, which reduced preci-
sion of estimates and precluded mechanism analy-
sis. Also, so as to be developmentally appropriate
across the age span from 9 months to 3 years, we
had to vary measures on key domains between time
points, although we mitigated this with the mea-
surement design and statistical approach used. This
was a ‘selective’ pre-emptive trial in an at-risk group
not selected for developmental atypicality; about two
thirds of the overall cohort were typically developing
at age 3 years with 6/53 (11%) showing categorical
ASD. Similar experimental intervention design with
‘indicated’ sampling (i.e. showing actual early atyp-
icality) might give different results.

 • This first RCT of a pre-emptive intervention in the first year sampled infants at familial risk. It undertook
repeated measures assessment from the end of treatment (15 months) to 27-month and then 39-month
follow-up.
• The 5-month parent-mediated video-aided intervention (9–14 months) reduced the severity of subsequent
prodromal autism symptoms over the period to 39-month follow-up, as well as producing positive impact on
dyadic parent–infant interactions.
• These findings are encouraging for the possibilities of pre-emptive intervention in autism. Future trials could
be powered so as to identify mechanisms of effectiveness and test further questions within autism
developmental science.
