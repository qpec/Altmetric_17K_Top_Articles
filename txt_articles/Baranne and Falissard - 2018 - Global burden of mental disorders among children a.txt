RESEARCH ARTICLE
Global burden of mental disorders 
among children aged 5–14 years
Marie Laure Baranne*  and Bruno Falissard
Abstract 
Background: The global burden of disease (GBD) study provides information about fatal and non-fatal health out-
comes around the world.
Methods: The objective of this work is to describe the burden of mental disorders among children aged 5–14 years 
in each of the six regions of the World Health Organisation. Data come from the GBD 2015 study. Outcomes: disability-
adjusted life-years (DALYs) are the main indicator of GBD studies and are built from years of life lost (YLLs) and years of 
life lived with disability (YLDs).
Results: Mental disorders are among the leading causes of YLDs and of DALYs in Europe and the Americas. Because 
of the importance of infectious diseases, mental disorders appear marginal in Africa for YLLs although they play an 
important role in YLDs there. Because the epidemiological transition that has taken place in Europe and the Americas 
(i.e., a switch from acute and infectious conditions to chronic and mental health issues) is likely to happen sooner or 
later across the entire planet, mental health problems in youth are likely to become one of the main public health 
challenges of the twenty-first century.
Conclusion: These results should improve health care if policy-makers use them to develop health policies to meet 
the real needs of populations (especially children) today.

Background
Determination of the health problems that most often 
or most severely affect specific populations is necessary 
to optimise health services and prioritise health policies. 
Until recently, the indicators most frequently chosen to 
understand population needs were mortality, life expec-
tancy, and their causes and risk factors. As advances in 
medical knowledge have increased life expectancy in 
most of the world’s regions, the dichotomy between 
fatal vs non-fatal effects has become much less relevant 
[1]. In 1992, the World Health Organisation (WHO) 
asked C. Murray and his collaborators to develop a more 
comprehensive indicator that would reflect not only the 
mortality but also the level of disability due to particular 
diseases. The Lancet published four articles applying this 
perspective in 1997, all based on the concept of the global 
burden of disease (GBD) [2]. They assessed GBD through 
a new indicator called the DALY, for disability-adjusted 
life years [3]. Since then, studies of DALYs and GBD, 
because they provide a comprehensive picture of popu-
lation needs, have become essential part of the public 
health literature. Technically, DALYs are estimated from 
mortality and disability data. Disability is estimated from 
the prevalence of a given disease, its average duration, 
and a subjective appreciation of its day-to-day impact 
(often obtained through revealed preference surveys in 
the general population) [2]. The first set of GBD studies 
did not clearly identify psychiatric disorders, which were 
grouped with neurologic disorders. The situation was 
even worse for most child and adolescent psychiatric dis-
orders, which have been seriously considered only since 
2010 [4].
Although some papers have already presented the 
results of the most recent GBD studies of young people,

most of their analyses were conducted at the level of the 
planet and thus masked the huge specificities that exist 
between regions [5]. For this reason, these analyses were 
unable to interpret the global weight of mental disorders 
adequately in the paediatric population.
The objective of the present paper is to describe and 
analyse the global burden of mental disorders among 
children aged 5–14 years throughout the world from the 
latest data available (GBD 2015), with a focus on each 
WHO region and an explicit summary of the relative 
importance of mortality and disability in each.
Methods
For GBD 2015, diseases were defined according to the 
International Classification of Diseases, 10th revision 
(ICD-10), and organised in a hierarchical classification 
[6, 7]. The first level of this classification comprises three 
main disease groups: communicable diseases (group 
1), non-communicable diseases (group 2), and injuries 
(group 3). These three groups are divided in 21 catego-
ries. The communicable disease categories include, for 
example, infectious and parasitic diseases and neonatal 
conditions. Categories of non-communicable diseases 
include mental disorders, as well as malignant neoplasms 
and endocrine, blood, and immune disorders. Injuries 
regroup intentional and non-intentional injuries. The 
third level of classification is closer to the usual ICD-10 
categories. Mental disorders, for instance, are divided 
into 13 subcategories: major depressive disorders, dys-
thymia, bipolar disorders, schizophrenia, alcohol use 
disorders, drug use disorders, anxiety disorders, eat-
ing disorders, autism spectrum disorders (reported in 
the GBD database as Autism and Asperger syndrome), 
conduct disorders, attention-deficit/hyperactivity disor-
der (ADHD), idiopathic intellectual disability, and other 
mental and behavioural disorders.
The aggregate data from the 2015 GBD study are 
freely available [7]. This dataset provides DALYs for the 
six WHO regions—Africa (AFR), the Americas region 
(AMR), South-East Asia (SEAR), Europe (EUR), the 
Eastern Mediterranean region (EMR), and the West 
Pacific region (WPR)—for each sex and for seven age 
groups: < 28 days, 1–59 months, 5–14, 15–29, 30–49, 
50–69 years, and 70 and older [6].
Formally, DALYs are the sum of years of life lost (YLLs) 
and years lost due to disability (YLDs) for disorder (d), 
age (a), sex (s), and year (t).
YLLs and YLDs are estimated as follows:
DALY (d, a, s, t) = YLL (d, a, s, t) + YLD (d, a, s, t).
YLL = N(d, s, a, t) × L(s, a),
where: N(d, s, a, t) is the number of deaths due to disor-
der (d) for a given age (a) and sex (s) in year (t). L(s, a) is 
a function specifying the number of YLLs for a person of 
sex (s) dying at age (a).
The equation for YLDs is:
where: P(d, s, a, t) = prevalence of the disorder of interest 
(d) at age (a) and sex (s); DW(d, s, a) = disability weight 
for the disorder of interest (d) at age (a) and sex (s); L(d, 
s, a, t) = average duration of the case until remission or 
death (years).
In the GBD 2015 study, disability weights were 
obtained from two international surveys in the general 
populations of nine countries in 2011 and 2013: Bang-
ladesh, Indonesia, Peru, Tanzania, the USA, Hungary, 
Italy, the Netherlands and Sweden [8, 9]. Two approaches 
were used: face-to face interviews and online surveys. 
The method relied on the revealed preference paradigm. 
More precisely, respondents were asked to determine the 
healthier of two situations in a series of questions. Con-
cerning ADHD, for example, one question was:
“Who do you think is healthier overall (in terms of 
having fewer physical or mental limitations on what 
the person can do in life), the first or the second per-
son:”
  
•
Person 1: “ADHD: the person is hyperactive and has 
difficulty concentrating, remembering things, and 
completing tasks.”
  
•
Person 2: “Partially controlled asthma: The person 
has wheezing and coughing once a week, which 
causes some difficulty with daily activities.”
The duration of each disability L(d, s, a, t) until remis-
sion or death was estimated by experts on the basis of a 
literature review.
The GBD 2015 study differed in some aspects from the 
previous studies [7]:
  
•
Age weighting is now uniform across the lifespan; 
earlier versions had assigned less weight to years of 
healthy life lost at extreme ages [10].
  
•
YLDs are now based on prevalence estimates, 
although the earlier GBD studies used disease inci-
dence preferentially.
  
•
YLDs are now adjusted for independent comorbidi-
ties.
  
•
Disease weights and prevalence estimation have been 
revised and updated.
YLD = P(d, s, a, t) × DW(d, s, a) × L(d, s, a, t),

At classification level two, where mental disorders 
appear as a broad category, we extracted the five main 
categories of disorders causing loss of DALYs in each of 
the six WHO regions, for children and adolescents aged 
from 5 to 14 years of each sex. At level 3 (the level of 
specific disorders), we considered the 20 disorders that 
explain the greatest losses of DALYs.
Then we standardised DALYs by the size of the popula-
tion aged 5–14 years:
DALY1000 = Number of DALYs/Total relevant (youth) 
population in the region.
We also estimated the relative trends of the DALY1000 
between 2000 and 2015 in each region.
 To evaluate the relative weight of death and disability in 
the burden of mental disorders, we explored the relative 
proportion of YLLs and YLDs. We also compared YLDs 
caused by mental disorders with all causes of YLDs in 
group 2 (non-communicable diseases).

The WHO regions are presented in Fig. 1.

Burden of mental disorders in 2000 and in 2015 in children 
aged 5–14 years
In the Americas and Europe, mental disorders in 2000 
ranked third among the causes of DALYs (Fig. 2). By 
2015, they had reached second place (Fig. 3).
In 2000, mental disorders were the fourth leading cause 
of DALYs in South-East Asia, the Eastern Mediterranean, 
and the Western Pacific. In 2015, their rank remained 
stable in South-East Asia, fell to fifth place in the East-
ern Mediterranean (likely because of wars in this region, 
which increased the number of deaths due to injuries), 
and reached third place in the Western Pacific.
In Africa, mental disorders were not in the top five 
causes of losses of DALYs in either 2000 or 2015. Infec-
tious diseases were the most prevalent cause of DALYs 
among children of this region. In Europe, from 2000 
to 2015, the impact of infectious diseases on DALYs 
decreased, while that of mental disorders increased. The 
same was true in the Western Pacific and South-East Asia 
and to a lesser extent in the Americas. Only in the East-
ern Mediterranean did this situation differ.
In addition to this period effect, there is also an income 
effect: the continent with the highest gross domestic 
product has globally fewer problems with infectious dis-
eases and more problems with mental disorders. This is 
especially true in Western Europe, where infectious dis-
eases are no longer in the top 5 DALY causes, but mental

disorders are in the first place. This phenomenon is called 
an epidemiological transition, which we will consider in 
more detail in the discussion. The epidemiologic transi-
tion concerns all age groups of a population. Our results 
show clearly that it is especially relevant in the 5–14 age 
group.
Mental disorders have an important impact on the 
YLDs in Africa (Fig. 3). This point is important because 
the organisation of health care systems depends strongly 
on the profile of patients with important disabilities.
Trends of the normalised burden of mental disorders 
from 2000 to 2015
Because the burden of disease evaluated from DALYs 
depends on the population size, it is also interest-
ing to look at a standardised estimate of the DALY, the 
DALY1000 described in the methods section. The course 
of this indicator was stable in most regions during the 
study period. As Table 1 shows, two regions had a relative 
variation in the DALY1000 between 2000 and 2015 that 
reached 5%: Europe and the Americas. Surprisingly, these 
variations moved in opposite directions. In Europe, the 
DALY1000 associated with mental disorders decreased 
by 5.3%. The simultaneous increase in the relative weight 
of mental disorders implies that the global health of chil-
dren and adolescents aged from 5 to 14 improved sub-
stantially. In the Americas, the DALY1000 associated 
with mental disorders increased by 4%.
Principal mental disorders (level 3 of analysis) that affect 
losses of DALYs (Additional file 1: Table S1 and Additional 
file 2: Table S2)
We focus here on the 20 diseases (considered fairly 
broadly) that caused the most DALYs. Except for Africa 
(which has no mental disorder in its top 20), most 
regions typically had four mental disorders in the top 
20 in both 2000 and 2015: conduct disorders and anxi-
ety disorders were respectively first and second among 
mental disorders, while major depressive disorders and 
autism-Asperger syndrome alternated between rank-
ing third or fourth, depending on continent and period, 
although one or the other was occasionally surpassed by 
idiopathic intellectual disability.
Among boys, the most common mental disorders in 
the top 20 causes of losses of DALYs in 2015 were con-
duct disorders (in all regions), autism-Asperger syn-
drome, and anxiety disorders. Among girls they were 
anxiety disorders, conduct disorders, and major depres-
sive disorder.
Relative importance of YLLs and YLDs
As expected, in the 5–14-year age group, the importance 
of YLLs due to mental disorders was marginal. YLDs are 
clearly the main component of these DALYs.
Discussion
Without data about DALYS, YLLs, and YLDs, it is dif-
ficult to determine health priorities rationally. When 
people hear the words leukaemia, stroke, Alzheimer, or 
schizophrenia, they experience feelings, emotions, and 
often compassion, but according to a metric that is not 
necessarily fair. For example, most consider that Hodg-
kin disease is clearly much more severe than anorexia 
nervosa, although the prognosis for survival is the same 
for both [11, 12]. Mental disorders, which are still consid-
ered mysterious in most societies because they are sup-
posed to affect the mind more than the body, are often 
neglected and even denied by populations. Policy-makers 
are thus often tempted to cut spending in this domain. 
This is even truer for child and adolescent psychiatry, 
where some pathologies, such as conduct disorders, are 
considered deviance rather than a health problem that 
requires compassion and care. For a long time, public 
health professionals did not significantly help repair this 
injustice; their quantitative work was limited to mortal-
ity statistics, while many important child and adolescent 
psychiatric disorders, such as autistic spectrum disor-
der or anxiety disorders, have only a marginal impact

on mortality, although their effect on daily life can be 
extreme.
The development and recording of DALYs and YLDs 
are thus an important breakthrough in the context 
of global health. We now have data covering several 
years for DALYs and YLDs due to mental disorders for 
5–14-year-olds in the different regions of the globe. This 
paper focuses on this crucial statistic.
The impact of mental disorders on the burden of dis-
ease among children aged 5–14 years appears to be very 
strong in the Americas and in Europe. In other regions, 
mental disorders also play a notable role that will surely 
increase in the future, as they undergo the “epidemio-
logical transition”
. Omran describes this concept as 
“focus[ing] on the complex change in patterns of health 
and disease and on the interactions between these pat-
terns and their demographic, economic and sociologic 
determinants and consequences” [13]. Europe and the 
Americas are the two regions where the epidemiologi-
cal transition was first observed, because of their high 
level of development. This transition begins with a 
decrease in mortality from infectious and epidemic dis-
eases and then the modification of the health problems 
encountered by populations, which because they are liv-
ing longer, face new and different health challenges [13]. 
An epidemiological transition results in the regression of 
communicable diseases and injuries, at the same time as 
non-communicable diseases, such as mental disorders 
but also degenerative disorders and cancers, tend to grow 
in importance. These changes have already taken place 
in Europe and the Americas. This trend is also notable 
but less advanced in the Western Pacific and South-East 
Asia regions. In the Eastern Mediterranean, the rank of 
mental disorders among 5–14 years has declined over 
the study period, while intentional injuries are now in 
the top five. This finding is most likely due to recent war 
in this region. This hypothesis is buttressed by the major 
increase between 2000 and 2015 of “Collective violence 
and legal intervention” as a cause of DALYs. In Africa, 
where infectious diseases remain common and lethal, 
mental disorders appear to play a lesser role. Neverthe-
less, the level 3 classification of diseases, which is more 
precise, showed the appearance of conduct disorders 
among 5–14 year-old boys in 2015. This may reflect the 
first sign of an epidemiological transition.
When we focus on the YLDs, which give an overview of 
the morbid impact of diseases, we see that even in emerg-
ing regions, the burden of mental disorders is already 
high and constant over time.
Furthermore, the many comorbidities make it difficult 
to disentangle the specific role of disease categories. For 
example, unintentional injuries play an important role in 
disability in many regions, but several mental disorders, 
such as conduct disorders and attention-deficit/hyperac-
tivity disorders, are associated with higher rates of inju-
ries [4]. This highlights the difficulties in assessing the 
actual prevalence of mental disorders in less developed 
areas. Populations with less access to health and psychi-
atric care are diagnosed less often, and the consequences 
of their disorders are not considered to be health-related. 
In 2011, Gore et al. analysed the burden of disease in the 
10–24 age group from earlier GBD date and showed the 
predominant place of mental disorders [14]. Even though 
these diseases were aggregated with neurologic disorders, 
the authors were able to show the importance of specific 
psychiatric disorders and discussed the difficulties in 
assessing them, as well as their low priority for research-
ers, especially in low- and middle-income countries.
This work obviously has some limitations. The calcula-
tion of DALYs requires the estimation of many parame-
ters that are known only approximately, at best. Mortality 
statistics are likely to be accurate because most coun-
tries have a system for registering deaths [15]. DALYs are 
assessed from three parameters (prevalence, disability 
weight, and average duration of the case until remission 
or death) evaluated from multiple points of view (epide-
miological surveys, opinion surveys, and expert knowl-
edge). These multiple sources of information present 
many possible sources of error that magnify the uncer-
tainty of the DALY estimates [16]. The individualisa-
tion of child psychiatric disorders is a breakthrough but 
also a challenge. Estimating its prevalence is difficult; it 
requires, among other things, a good health care system.
Furthermore, disease weighting is likely to be the 
trickiest part of these estimations. Respondents had to 
choose between two heath situations explained in sim-
plistic terms. For example, the description of ADHD 
does not come close to an accurate description of the 
reality experienced by patients and their families in their 
daily lives: “is hyperactive and has difficulty concentrat-
ing, remembering things, and completing tasks” [7]. 
This presentation ignores the impact of ADHD on social 
exclusion, stigmatisation, school difficulties, accidents, 
etc. The consequence is a quite debatable relative ranking 
[17]. For example, ADHD has a disease weight of 0.045, 
whereas symptomatic benign prostatic hypertrophy (the 
lay description of which is: “feels the urge to urinate fre-
quently, but when passing urine, it comes out slowly and 
is sometimes painful”) has a disease weight of 0.067. Dis-
ease weighting is a powerful approach toward capturing 
the population’s point of view of health situations. It is 
limited, however, by the fact that it collects abstract and 
subjective representations of people who have never dealt 
with or perhaps even seen the disorder, as opposed to the 
real experience of patients and their families. Another 
important limitation comes from the definition of burden 
 Page 8 of 9

Child Adolesc Psychiatry Ment Health  (2018) 12:19 
of disease, which does not include the impact of disor-
ders on caregivers [18, 19]. In many ways, mental disor-
ders cannot be considered standard diseases, especially 
among children. Psychiatric diseases in a population aged 
5–14 years must be considered systemic. That is, they 
affect a community, most often a family, which must be 
considered as a whole [20].
This paper is intended as an urgent signal of alarm to 
national and international public health institutions and 
policy-makers. The world is experiencing an epidemio-
logic transition. The relative burden of disease of mental 
disorders among children aged 5–14 years is increasing 
and will accelerate even more in the near future. This 
change and the problems accompanying it will require 
specific responses. Psychiatric diseases in children must 
be considered specifically. Planning a vaccination pro-
gram or an antibiotic prescription is very different from 
organising a global policy for mental health and psychi-
atric care. It requires a long-term perspective, specially 
trained professionals, and careful preparation in view of 
the numerous obstacles that must be anticipated, includ-
ing local representations of psychiatric diseases, the time 
necessary for effectiveness, and the extensive resources, 
financial and human, that will be required. This is a major 
challenge.
Conclusions
The recognition of mental disorders in children and their 
consequences has improved, thanks, in particular, to very 
macroscopic studies such as the Global burden of dis-
ease study. Our description shows two major trends: the 
rates of mental disorders per inhabitant have remained 
stable over time and at the same time the epidemiologi-
cal transition has placed them among the main causes of 
disease burden in this age group. These results ought to 
lead to improved health care if policy-makers use them to 
develop health policies to meet the real needs of popula-
tions today. Prevention, diagnosis, treatment and family 
support should be organised according to these findings.
