 Introduction
Streptococcus
 pyogenes
 or
 Group
 A
 Streptococcus
 (GAS)
 causes
a
 massive
 disease
 burden
 that
 has
 been
 underestimated
 by
 global
health
 authorities.
 A
 2005
 study
 estimated
 that
 there
 are
 >500,000
deaths
 annually
 due
 to
 the
 bacteria,
 mostly
 occurring
 in
 low
 and
middle
 income
 countries
 [1].
The
 agent
 is
 a
 Gram-positive
 bacterium
 with
 the
 human
 as
 its
unique
 reservoir
 and
 an
 array
 of
 virulence
 factors
 allowing
 for
 a
very
 broad

colonization
 of
 GAS,
 represent
 the
 primary
 reservoirs
 responsi-
ble
 for
 the
 maintenance
 and
 transmission
 of
 GAS
 to
 a
 new
 host.
The
 ability
 of
 GAS
 to
 colonize
 and
 persist
 in
 skin
 tissue
 permits
transmission
 through
 person-to-person
 contact.
 GAS
 can
 also
 over-
come
 innate
 and
 acquired
 immune
 mechanisms
 present
 in
 saliva
 to
remain
 viable
 for
 long
 periods,
 enabling
 transmission
 from
 infected
persons
 or
 asymptomatic
 carriers
 via
 respiratory
 droplets
 [2].
 In
addition,
 numerous
 outbreaks
 caused
 by
 food-borne
 GAS
 have
 also
been
 reported
 [2].
GAS
 bacteria
 are
 able
 to
 penetrate
 normal
 tissue
 barriers
 lead-
ing
 to
 invasive
 infection
 at
 local
 (e.g.
 retropharyngeal
 abscess
 or
necrotizing
 fasciitis)
 as
 well
 as
 distant
 sites
 (e.g.
 septic
 arthritis).
 It
produces
 an
 array
 of
 superantigens
 that
 can
 result
 in
 streptococ-
cal
 toxic
 shock
 syndrome,
 which
 carries
 a
 high
 case
 fatality
 rate
(>50%).
 In
 addition,
 invasive
 GAS
 disease
 is
 a
 frequent
 cause
 of
 sep-
sis
 in
 children
 and
 adults
 and
 has
 a
 high-case
 fatality
 rate
 leading
to
 at
 least
 150,000
 deaths
 annually
 worldwide,
 although
 this
 figure
is
 almost
 certainly
 an
 underestimate
 because
 of
 sparse
 data

many
 developing
 countries
 [1].
 GAS
 can
 also
 cause
 invasive
 infec-
tion
 in
 infants
 (neonatal
 sepsis)
 and
 the
 mother
 (puerperal
 sepsis);
indeed,
 in
 the
 UK,
 GAS
 has
 been
 reported
 as
 the
 leading
 single
 cause
of
 maternal
 death
 [3].
The
 immune
 response
 to
 GAS
 can
 be
 disordered
 and
 early
 symp-
tomatic
 infection
 can
 lead
 to
 later,
 so
 called
 post-streptococcal
sequelae,
 including
 acute
 rheumatic
 fever
 (ARF)
 that
 in
 turn
leads
 to
 chronic
 rheumatic
 heart
 disease
 (RHD),
 as
 well
 as
post-streptococcal
 glomerulonephritis
 (PSGN).
 ARF/RHD
 is
 an
uncommon
 disease
 today
 in
 most
 resource-rich
 countries
 including
the
 United
 States,
 but
 it
 remains
 the
 major
 cause
 of
 acquired
 heart
disease
 in
 children,
 adolescents
 and
 young
 adults
 in
 the
 developing
world,
 responsible
 for
 at
 least
 350,000
 premature
 deaths
 per
 year
[4].
 Available
 data
 on
 the
 prevalence
 of
 RHD
 suggest
 that
 there
 are
over
 30
 million
 people
 affected
 by
 RHD
 worldwide.
 PSGN
 is
 thought
to
 contribute
 to
 the
 high
 rates
 of
 end-stage
 renal
 failure
 in
 GAS
endemic
 regions
 [5].
GAS
 pharyngitis
 and
 impetigo
 are
 responsible
 for
 the
 greatest
absolute
 number
 of
 symptomatic
 GAS
 infections
 each
 year.
 GAS
pharyngitis
 affects
 approximately
 8–15%
 of
 school-aged
 children
per
 year,
 whereas
 GAS
 impetigo
 is
 a
 very
 common
 infection
 in
 chil-
dren,
 especially
 in
 tropical
 developing
 countries
 with
 a
 prevalence
of
 >10%,
 and
 even
 over
 50%
 in
 some
 settings
 [6].
GAS
 remains
 susceptible
 to
 penicillin.
 In
 spite
 of
 its
 widespread
use
 there
 is
 no
 evidence
 to
 suggest
 the
 burden
 of
 GAS
 diseases
is
 decreasing
 in
 low
 and
 middle-income
 settings.
 Serious
 chronic
disease
 associated
 with
 streptococcal
 disease
 has
 decreased
 in
 inci-
dence
 in
 high
 income
 countries
 in
 most
 populations.
 Antibiotic
treatment
 of
 pharyngitis
 is
 highly
 effective
 at
 preventing
 ARF
 [7],
however
 primary
 prevention
 programmes
 are
 resource
 intensive
especially
 for
 low
 and
 middle
 income
 countries
 [8,9].
 Furthermore,
many
 cases
 (possibly
 over
 60%)
 of
 ARF
 occur
 without
 a
 history
 of
symptomatic
 pharyngitis,
 and
 it
 has
 been
 hypothesized
 that
 GAS
skin
 infection
 may
 also
 contribute
 to
 ARF
 [10].
 For
 those
 diag-
nosed
 with
 ARF,
 secondary
 penicillin
 prophylaxis
 is
 effective
 in
preventing
 recurrent
 ARF
 episodes
 and
 consequent
 worsening
 of
RHD
 when
 efficiently
 delivered
 [11],
 but
 it
 requires
 monthly
 peni-
cillin
 injections
 over
 many
 years
 [8].
Serious
 GAS
 diseases
 do
 appear
 to
 be
 waning
 in
 some
 middle-
income
 countries,
 probably
 because
 of
 improved
 living
 conditions
and
 access
 to
 health
 services.
 However,
 GAS
 diseases
 continue
 to
exact
 a
 toll
 in
 terms
 of
 mortality,
 morbidity
 and
 economic
 costs,
even
 in
 wealthy
 countries,
 such
 as
 the
 important
 contribution
 of
invasive
 GAS
 disease
 to
 maternal
 mortality
 in
 the
 United
 Kingdom
[3].
Data
 are
 sparse
 on
 the
 economic
 burden
 of
 GAS
 disease,
 though
a
 recent
 study
 in
 Fiji
 found
 that
 the
 cost
 of
 RHD
 mortality
 over
 a
5
 year
 period
 was
 over
 US$30
 million,
 close
 to
 one
 third
 of
 one
percent
 of
 total
 GDP,
 representing
 a
 significant
 economic
 burden
for
 the
 country
 [12].
 An
 economic
 evaluation
 of
 interventions
 for
ARF/RHD
 found
 that
 a
 vaccine
 against
 GAS
 would
 be
 the
 most
 cost-
effective
 intervention
 for
 ARF/RHD
 in
 ARF-endemic
 regions
 at
 a
 cost
of
 between
 US$137–458
 per
 DALY
 averted,
 assuming
 80%
 efficacy
and
 65–95%
 coverage
 (compared
 with
 22–33
 thousand
 dollars
 for
treatment
 of
 sore
 throat)
 [13].
 Even
 wealthy
 countries
 are
 affected
 –
a
 study
 of
 GAS
 pharyngitis
 in
 the
 US
 suggested
 that
 GAS
 pharyngitis
costs
 at
 least
 US$500
 million
 per
 annum
 [14].
 Few
 data
 are
 available
for
 impetigo,
 invasive
 disease,
 scarlet
 fever
 and
 PSGN.
Better
 epidemiologic
 data
 are
 still
 needed
 in
 most
 developing
countries,
 particularly
 on
 the
 contribution
 of
 RHD
 to
 premature
mortality
 and
 long
 term
 sequelae
 [15],
 and
 on
 the
 rate
 and
 mortality
of
 invasive
 disease,
 especially
 in
 the
 newborn
 and
 the
 new
 mother.
Data
 regarding
 strain
 diversity
 of
 the
 bacteria
 are
 also
 needed
 in
many
 low
 and
 middle
 income
 countries.
 Even
 with
 these
 limita-
tions,
 the
 current
 data
 on
 disease
 burden
 make
 a
 convincing
 case
for
 the
 need
 for
 an
 effective
 vaccine
 that
 could
 offer
 a
 practical
strategy
 for
 disease
 control
 and
 prevention,
 especially
 for
 ARF
 and
RHD.
2.
 Overview
 of
 current
 efforts
2.1.
 Biological
 feasibility
 for
 vaccine
 development
Although
 there
 are
 no
 currently
 licensed
 GAS
 vaccines,
 the
 bio-
logical
 feasibility
 for
 GAS
 vaccine
 development
 is
 supported
 by
 a
number
 of
 observations
 including
 the
 natural
 history
 of
 GAS
 infec-
tion,
 available
 serologic
 data
 from
 natural
 history
 studies,
 animal
data
 from
 pre-clinical
 studies,
 and
 evidence
 of
 protection
 from
challenge
 in
 human
 subjects
 immunized
 with
 purified
 M
 proteins.
Pre-school
 and
 school-aged
 children
 experience
 repeated
episodes
 of
 GAS
 pharyngitis
 and
 skin
 infection
 until
 they
 reach
early
 adulthood
 when
 these
 infections
 become
 far
 less
 common,
indicating
 that
 immunity
 to
 infection
 develops
 with
 age.
 One
 expla-
nation
 for
 this
 observation
 is
 that
 immunity
 is
 type-specific
 –
 that
is,
 that
 when
 a
 person
 is
 infected
 by
 a
 strain
 of
 GAS
 (most
 commonly
referred
 to
 as
 an
 M-type/emm-type)
 the
 immune
 response
 protects
them
 against
 subsequent
 infection
 due
 to
 the
 homologous
 type,
but
 not
 or
 less
 completely
 against
 heterologous
 types
 [16,17].
 Over
time
 individuals
 meet
 multiple
 types
 of
 GAS
 and
 develop
 immu-
nity
 against
 these
 multiple
 types.
 An
 alternate
 or
 complementary
explanation
 is
 that
 generation
 of
 immunity
 requires
 repeated
presentation
 of
 conserved
 antigens
 before
 a
 threshold
 level
 of
 pro-
tective
 immunity
 is
 achieved.
 There
 is
 no
 direct
 evidence
 for
 the
latter
 explanation
 and
 it
 is
 not
 mutually
 exclusive
 with
 the
 former.
The
 paradigm
 of
 type-specific
 immunity
 is
 further
 supported
by
 elegant
 longitudinal
 studies
 that
 have
 observed
 that
 infection
with
 a
 single
 strain
 of
 GAS
 leads
 to
 generation
 of
 strain
 specific
(M-protein)
 antibodies
 that
 lead
 to
 a
 long
 period
 (up
 to
 30
 years)
of
 protection
 against
 the
 homologous
 strains
 but
 not
 against
 other
strains
 [16].
Pre-clinical
 (murine)
 studies
 of
 GAS
 vaccine
 candidates
 (pre-
dominantly
 M
 protein
 vaccines)
 have
 demonstrated
 protection
 in
challenge
 studies
 [18].
 Further,
 subjects
 vaccinated
 with
 purified
M
 proteins
 from
 GAS
 were
 protected
 against
 challenge
 with
 vir-
ulent
 homologous
 strain
 of
 GAS
 [19–21].
 These
 GAS
 pharyngeal
challenge
 studies,
 involving
 a
 total
 of
 178
 healthy
 adult
 volunteers
in
 3
 separate
 studies
 were
 successfully
 used
 to
 demonstrate
 efficacy
of
 prototype
 M
 protein
 vaccines
 in
 the
 1970s.
 Vaccine
 efficacy
 of
 up
to
 89%
 was
 demonstrated
 in
 these
 studies
 [19].
 Importantly,
 GAS
challenge
 was
 safe,
 with
 all
 participants
 responding
 to
 penicillin
therapy
 without
 complications
 or
 sequelae
 developing.
2.2.
 Serotype/strain
 coverage
A
 potential
 barrier
 to
 a
 type-specific
 M
 protein-based
 vaccine
is
 that
 there
 are
 >200
 emm-types
 of
 GAS
 (the
 N-terminal
 part
 of
the
 M
 protein
 has
 a
 variable
 amino
 acid
 sequence
 resulting
 in
 anti-
genic
 diversity
 and
 is
 the
 basis
 for
 this
 widely
 used
 nucleotide
 based
emm-typing
 scheme).
 If
 type-specific
 antibody
 protection
 is
 the
major
 mechanism
 by
 which
 immunity
 is
 generated
 against
 GAS
then
 this
 clearly
 raises
 the
 issue
 of
 potential
 coverage
 for
 type-
specific
 vaccines.
 This
 was
 highlighted
 in
 an
 article
 published
 in
2009
 that
 identified
 that
 the
 distribution
 of
 emm-types
 was
 quite
different
 in
 developing
 compared
 to
 developed
 settings
 [22].
 The
study
 observed
 that
 there
 was
 a
 higher
 diversity
 of
 strains
 in
 lower
to
 middle
 income
 settings
 versus
 high
 income
 settings,
 and
 indi-
cated
 that
 the
 theoretical
 coverage
 of
 a
 26-valent
 (combination
 of
specific
 strains)
 vaccine
 would
 be
 favourable
 in
 developed
 sett-
ings
 (>72%)
 while
 strain
 coverage
 would
 be
 much
 lower
 in
 settings
were
 serious
 GAS
 disease
 is
 more
 common
 (e.g.
 Africa
 39%
 and
Pacific
 24%).
 However,
 recent
 data
 from
 epidemiologic,
 genomic

 Steer
 et
 al.

 2953–2958
 
2955
and
 in
 vitro
 studies
 suggest
 that
 there
 may
 be
 immunologic
 “cross-
protection”
 between
 emm-types
 of
 GAS
 that
 may
 overcome
 this
issue
 [23,24].
 The
 hypothesis
 for
 this
 cross-protection
 is
 that
antibodies
 generated
 against
 individual
 emm-types
 may
 actually
provide
 some
 protection
 against
 a
 selection
 of
 heterologous
 emm-
types.
 It
 is
 proposed
 that
 this
 cross-protection
 occurs
 within
 48
emm-clusters
 [23].
 There
 is
 ongong
 investigation
 in
 this
 area
 but
it
 does
 provide
 some
 hope
 for
 a
 broadly
 effective
 vaccine
 based
using
 a
 type-specific
 approach.
 There
 are
 fewer
 epidemiologic
 data
regarding
 coverage
 based
 on
 the
 presence
 or
 absence
 of
 conserved
antigens.
2.3.
 General
 approaches
 to
 vaccine
 development
 for
 this
 disease
for
 low
 and
 middle
 income
 country
 markets
ARF
 occurs
 predominantly
 in
 school-aged
 children
 in
 low
 and
middle-income
 countries
 because
 that
 is
 the
 age-group
 in
 which
the
 triggering
 infection
 (GAS
 pharyngitis)
 occurs,
 although
 in
 some
settings
 it
 is
 hypothesized
 that
 earlier
 skin
 infection
 may
 prime
 the
immune
 system
 [25]. Invasive
 disease
 occurs
 in
 all
 ages,
 with
 an
increased
 incidence
 in
 infants
 and
 the
 elderly.
 PSGN
 occurs
 most
frequently
 in
 pre-school
 children,
 reflecting
 the
 greatest
 burden
of
 the
 triggering
 infection
 (GAS
 impetigo).
 Therefore,
 while
 con-
sensus
 in
 the
 field
 has
 not
 been
 reached
 on
 a
 target
 age
 group
 for
vaccination,
 an
 infant
 or
 toddler
 schedule
 will
 likely
 be
 the
 most
appropriate
 schedule
 for
 most
 endemic
 settings,
 possibly
 with
 a
school
 entry
 booster
 dose.
 In
 non-endemic
 settings,
 a
 school
 entry
schedule
 that
 coincides
 with
 the
 schedule
 for
 final
 TDap,
 IPV,
 and
MMR
 doses
 may
 be
 appropriate.
 In
 areas
 where
 GAS
 is
 an
 impor-
tant
 cause
 of
 maternal
 and
 neonatal
 sepsis,
 maternal
 immunization
may
 also
 be
 considered.
A
 successful
 vaccine
 could
 address
 a
 huge
 unmet
 public
 health
demand,
 and
 a
 vaccine
 that
 can
 prevent
 ARF
 (and
 thus
 RHD)
 as
 well
as
 invasive
 GAS
 disease
 has
 the
 potential
 to
 save
 over
 500,000
 pre-
mature
 deaths
 per
 year.
 In
 addition,
 prevention
 of
 GAS
 pharyngitis
and
 impetigo
 would
 have
 an
 enormous
 impact
 on
 reductions
 in
morbidity
 through
 improved
 quality
 of
 life
 as
 well
 as
 a
 major
 eco-
nomic
 impact
 through
 reduced
 health
 care
 expenditure
 on
 these
exceedingly
 common
 infectious
 disease
 problems
 of
 childhood.
3.
 Technical
 and
 regulatory
 assessment
Despite
 considerable
 progress,
 there
 remain
 a
 number
 of
 sig-
nificant
 barriers
 to
 GAS
 vaccine
 development
 and
 candidates
remain
 in
 their
 infancy
 [26].
 There
 is
 no
 clear
 pathway
 agreed
 by
multi-disciplinary
 consensus
 for
 a
 pathway
 for
 vaccine
 licensure,
although
 global
 efforts
 are
 beginning
 to
 come
 together
 through
 a
rudimentary
 roadmap
 for
 vaccine
 development
 [26,27].
 GAS
 vac-
cines
 are
 now
 considered
 “impeded
 vaccines”.
 The
 major
 issues
include,
 but
 are
 not
 limited
 to:
 safety
 concerns,
 an
 incomplete
understanding
 of
 immune
 protection
 in
 humans,
 inadequate
 epi-
demiological
 data,
 minimal
 development
 of
 vaccines
 that
 contain
both
 type-specific
 emm
 antigens
 and
 conserved
 antigens
 and
limited
 commercial
 interest.
A
 particular
 issue
 is
 development
 of
 a
 correlate
 of
 human
immune
 protection
 [28],
 reflecting
 the
 need
 for
 an
 improved
understanding
 of
 GAS
 immunity,
 including
 the
 immune
 response
to
 GAS
 skin
 infection,
 the
 role
 of
 T-cell
 immunity
 and
 the
 rel-
ative
 contributions
 of
 common
 conserved
 antigens
 in
 inducing
protective
 immunity.
 Opsonophagocytic
 antibodies
 or
 bactericidal
antibodies
 
are
 
potential
 
correlates,
 
but
 
reliable
 
and
 
repro-
ducible
 assays
 to
 measure
 these
 antibodies
 are
 lacking
 [28].
The
 most
 frequently
 used
 functional
 assay
 is
 the
 indirect
 bac-
tericidal
 test,
 which
 is
 a
 time-consuming
 and
 methodologically
challenging
 test.
 The
 establishment
 of
 correlates
 of
 protection
would
 be
 much
 facilitated
 by
 the
 availability
 of
 an
 effective
vaccine.
Concerns
 regarding
 vaccine
 safety
 are
 based
 upon
 a
 theoretical
risk
 of
 autoimmune
 reactions
 in
 vaccinees
 leading
 to
 the
 devel-
opment
 of
 ARF.
 One
 small
 study
 of
 a
 crude
 M
 protein
 vaccine
suggested
 that
 there
 may
 be
 an
 increased
 risk
 of
 ARF
 in
 vac-
cine
 recipients
 [29];
 however,
 there
 are
 a
 number
 of
 concerns
about
 the
 design
 of
 this
 trial
 that
 make
 it
 difficult
 to
 inter-
pret,
 and
 autoimmune
 reactions
 have
 not
 been
 observed
 in
 the
other
 human
 GAS
 vaccine
 trials
 involving
 thousands
 of
 study
subjects
 [18].
Better
 epidemiologic
 data
 are
 also
 required,
 for
 assessing
 burden
of
 disease
 to
 strengthen
 the
 case
 for
 GAS
 vaccine
 development,
 and
also
 for
 assessing
 type
 diversity
 and
 thus
 vaccine
 coverage
 more
systematically
 with
 high
 quality,
 standardized
 molecular
 typing
studies
 in
 more
 countries,
 particularly
 in
 Africa
 and
 Asia.
Combination
 vaccines
 may
 be
 a
 viable
 approach
 to
 overcoming
“gaps”
 in
 emm
 type
 coverage
 achieved
 with
 multivalent
 vaccines
alone
 and
 to
 potentially
 broaden
 the
 immune
 response.
 However,
to
 date
 there
 has
 been
 minimal
 progress
 in
 combining
 antigens
 in
a
 single
 vaccine
 [30],
 and
 such
 a
 move
 would
 need
 to
 overcome
proprietary
 interests
 and
 intellectual
 property
 rights.
 It
 is
 unclear
exactly
 why
 there
 has
 been
 an
 apparent
 reluctance
 of
 large
 phar-
maceutical
 companies
 to
 invest
 in
 clinical
 development
 of
 GAS
vaccines.
 The
 obstacles
 listed
 above,
 together
 with
 the
 percep-
tion
 of
 a
 questionable
 market
 for
 a
 vaccine
 in
 affluent
 countries,
likely
 combine
 to
 create
 the
 impression
 of
 adverse
 commercial
risk.
Although
 the
 ultimate
 health
 need
 is
 for
 a
 vaccine
 to
 protect
against
 ARF/RHD
 and
 invasive
 disease,
 the
 relatively
 low
 incidence
of
 these
 diseases
 and
 the
 time
 delay
 between
 the
 initiating
 event
and
 disease
 makes
 these
 diseases
 potentially
 difficult
 endpoints
 for
phase
 III
 efficacy
 studies
 because
 trials
 would
 be
 complicated
 and
require
 well
 over
 10,000
 subjects
 [31].
 However,
 protective
 effi-
cacy
 against
 pharyngitis
 is
 a
 realistic
 efficacy
 endpoint
 for
 candidate
GAS
 vaccines
 in
 phase
 III
 trials
 and
 prevention
 of
 GAS
 pharyn-
gitis
 should
 enable
 licensure
 of
 efficacious
 and
 medically
 useful
vaccines.
 Importantly,
 GAS
 pharyngitis
 is
 well
 established
 as
 the
triggering
 event
 for
 ARF,
 and
 so
 prevention
 of
 pharyngitis
 can
 rea-
sonably
 be
 assumed
 to
 translate
 to
 prevention
 of
 ARF.
A
 potential
 strategy
 to
 improve
 understanding
 of
 GAS
 immunol-
ogy
 and
 also
 to
 create
 a
 pathway
 for
 relatively
 rapid
 testing
 of
new
 GAS
 vaccine
 candidates
 is
 through
 the
 development
 of
 human
GAS
 (pharyngeal)
 challenge
 studies.
 Previous
 studies
 (in
 the
 1970s)
in
 over
 170
 volunteers
 have
 shown
 that
 this
 approach
 is
 feasible
[19–21],
 and
 proposals
 are
 under
 consideration
 for
 funding
 for
 a
revival
 of
 this
 approach.
4.
 Status
 of
 vaccine
 research
 and
 development
 activities
GAS
 vaccines
 can
 be
 broadly
 divided
 into
 M
 protein-based
 and
non-M
 protein-based
 vaccines.
 The
 GAS
 has
 a
 broad
 armamen-
tarium
 of
 virulence
 factors,
 but
 it
 is
 the
 M
 protein
 that
 is
 the
major
 virulence
 determinant
 of
 the
 organism.
 The
 M
 protein
 is
 a
coiled-coil
 protein
 consisting
 of
 3
 domains:
 an
 A-repeat/N-terminal
domain,
 which
 is
 highly
 variable
 and
 is
 used
 for
 epidemiologic
molecular
 typing
 (emm
 typing);
 a
 B-repeat
 domain
 (antibodies
against
 this
 region
 are
 not
 opsonic
 and
 some
 are
 cross-reactive
with
 human
 tissues)
 and
 a
 conserved
 C-repeat
 domain.
 The
 vac-
cines
 that
 have
 entered
 or
 are
 nearing
 clinical
 investigation
 are
 the
N-terminal
 M
 protein-based
 multivalent
 vaccines
 (26-valent
 and
30-valent
 vaccines)
 and
 conserved
 M
 protein
 vaccines
 (the
 J8
 vac-
cine
 and
 the
 StreptInCor
 vaccine)
 [32–35].
 There
 are
 a
 variety
 of
other
 vaccine
 candidates
 that
 are
 at
 various
 stages
 of
 discovery
 and
development
 (Table
 1).

4.1.
 26-Valent
 and
 30-valent
 M
 protein
 vaccines
These
 vaccines
 consist
 of
 fused
 recombinant
 peptides
 from
 the
N-terminal
 region
 of
 M
 proteins
 from
 multiple
 different
 emm
 types
of
 GAS
 [32,33,36].
 The
 original
 prototype
 multivalent
 vaccine
 was
a
 hexavalent
 vaccine
 that
 was
 evaluated
 in
 a
 phase
 I
 trial
 and
 later
expanded
 to
 a
 26-valent
 vaccine
 and
 most
 recently
 a
 30-valent
 vac-
cine.
 The
 26-valent
 vaccine
 underwent
 a
 phase
 I/II
 clinical
 trial
 in
human
 adult
 volunteers
 and
 was
 shown
 to
 be
 safe
 and
 immuno-
genic
 [32].
 Functional
 opsonic
 antibodies
 were
 induced
 against
all
 emm
 types
 of
 GAS
 in
 the
 vaccine.
 The
 26-valent
 vaccine
 was
reformulated
 into
 a
 30-valent
 vaccine
 to
 increase
 “coverage”
 of
 cir-
culating
 emm
 types
 in
 the
 United
 States,
 Canada
 and
 Europe
 as
 well
as
 developing
 countries
 [33].
 Epidemiologic
 surveys
 suggest
 that
the
 26-valent
 vaccine
 would
 provide
 good
 coverage
 of
 circulating
strains
 of
 GAS
 in
 industrialized
 countries
 (over
 72%)
 but
 poor
 cov-
erage
 in
 many
 developing
 countries
 (as
 low
 as
 24%
 in
 the
 Pacific
region)
 [22].
 In
 preclinical
 studies,
 the
 30-valent
 vaccine
 has
 been
shown
 to
 induce
 functional
 opsonic
 antibodies
 against
 all
 of
 the
emm
 types
 represented
 in
 the
 vaccine
 [24].
 An
 intriguing
 finding
of
 the
 studies
 of
 the
 30-valent
 vaccine
 is
 that
 antibodies
 produced
by
 the
 vaccine
 were
 shown
 to
 cross-opsonize
 a
 proportion
 of
 non-
vaccine
 emm
 types
 of
 GAS
 [24],
 implying
 that
 cross-protection
 may
mitigate,
 to
 a
 greater
 or
 lesser
 extent,
 the
 limited
 coverage
 of
 the
30-valent
 vaccine
 in
 many
 tropical
 developing
 settings
 where
 GAS
disease
 is
 endemic.
 A
 phase
 I
 clinical
 evaluation
 of
 the
 30-valent
vaccine
 in
 adult
 volunteers
 is
 anticipated
 in
 the
 third
 quarter
 of
2015.
4.2.
 Conserved
 M
 protein
 vaccines
These
 vaccines
 contain
 antigens
 from
 the
 conserved
 C-repeat
portion
 of
 the
 M
 protein.
 The
 StreptInCor
 vaccine
 incorporates
selected
 T
 and
 B-cell
 epitopes
 from
 the
 C-repeat
 region
 in
 a
synthetic
 55
 amino
 acid
 polypeptide,
 whereas
 the
 J8
 and
 J14
 vac-
cines
 contain
 shorter
 single
 minimal
 B
 cell
 epitopes
 from
 this
same
 region
 [37,38].
 These
 vaccines
 have
 the
 clear
 advantage
of
 being
 comprised
 of
 a
 minimal
 number
 of
 antigens.
 Extensive
studies
 in
 mice,
 particularly
 of
 the
 J8
 vaccine
 candidate,
 have
shown
 that
 these
 antigens
 produce
 opsonic
 antibodies
 that
 protect
against
 intraperitoneal
 challenge
 when
 the
 vaccine
 is
 administered
parenterally
 and
 against
 intranasal
 challenge
 when
 the
 vaccine
 is
administered
 intranasally
 [34,39].
 The
 J8
 vaccine
 has
 recently
 been
re-formulated
 with
 a
 CXC
 chemokine
 protease
 which
 was
 able
 to
protect
 mice
 against
 both
 intraperitoneal
 challenge
 and
 also
 against
skin
 infection
 in
 a
 novel
 pyoderma
 mouse
 model
 [40].
 Limited
epidemiological
 data
 available
 for
 the
 J8
 peptide
 indicate
 that
 its
sequence
 is
 highly
 conserved
 among
 multiple
 emm
 types
 of
 GAS
and
 across
 regions
 [41].
 The
 J8
 vaccine
 entered
 a
 phase
 1
 trial
 in
adult
 volunteers
 in
 2013
 but
 the
 results
 of
 this
 trial
 have
 not
 yet
been
 reported.
 The
 StreptinCor
 vaccine
 has
 been
 formulated
 into
GMP
 StreptInCor
 plus
 alum
 with
 plans
 to
 enter
 phase
 I
 clinical
assays
 in
 healthy
 adult
 volunteers
 in
 Brazil
 in
 2016.
4.3.
 Other
 vaccines
Cell
 wall
 and
 secreted
 virulence
 factors,
 such
 as
 streptococcal
C5a
 peptidase,
 GAS
 carbohydrate
 and
 streptococcal
 fibronectin-
binding
 proteins,
 among
 others,
 have
 been
 the
 subject
 of
 vaccine
research
 for
 up
 to
 20
 years
 with
 some
 encouraging
 results,
 par-
ticularly
 for
 C5a
 peptidase,
 but
 none
 of
 these
 candidates
 has
entered
 clinical
 trials
 [18].
 More
 recently,
 a
 number
 of
 promis-
ing,
 apparently
 conserved,
 vaccine
 candidates
 have
 been
 identified
using
 immunization
 of
 mice
 with
 GAS
 gene
 segments
 [42].
 In
 a
large
 study,
 immunization
 of
 mice
 with
 GAS
 gene
 segments
 and
challenge
 studies,
 identified
 several
 known
 and
 new
 antigens,
among
 them
 three
 antigens
 were
 selected
 for
 further
 development:
spy0416
 (spyCEP),
 spy0167
 (streptolysin
 O,
 SLO)
 and
 spy0269,
 a
surface
 exclusion
 protein
 [43].
 These
 three
 antigens
 were
 combined
together
 in
 a
 single
 vaccine
 (so-called
 “Combo”)
 and
 were
 found
to
 provide
 broad
 coverage
 against
 multiple
 GAS
 strains
 in
 mouse
models
 [43].
 Combo
 has
 not
 yet
 entered
 clinical
 trials
 however.
5.
 Likelihood
 for
 financing
GAS
 vaccine
 development
 has
 been
 supported
 in
 the
 past
 by
industry
 (e.g.
 Merck
 support
 of
 the
 J8
 vaccine
 and
 of
 the
 26-valent
vaccine,
 ID
 Biomedical
 Corporation
 support
 of
 the
 26-valent
 vac-
cine,
 Novartis
 Vaccines
 and
 Diagnostics,
 now
 GSK,
 support
 of
 the
Combo
 vaccine
 and
 Intercell,
 now
 Valneva
 of
 a
 similar
 vaccine
approach).
 The
 National
 Institute
 of
 Allergy
 and
 Infectious
 Dis-
eases
 (NIAID)
 at
 the
 US
 National
 Institutes
 for
 Health
 supported
 the
development
 of
 potential
 clinical
 trial
 sites
 in
 2005–7
 (Fiji,
 Mali,
Nicaragua,
 and
 South
 Africa).
 The
 Novartis
 Vaccines
 Institute
 for
Global
 Health
 (NVGH)
 included
 GAS
 vaccine
 development
 in
 its
2013
 work
 programme.
In
 2014
 the
 Australian
 and
 New
 Zealand
 governments
 made
an
 initial
 AU$
 3
 million
 investment
 into
 vaccine
 development
 in
these
 2
 countries
 where
 RHD
 is
 a
 public
 health
 priority
 through
an
 initiative
 known
 as
 CANVAS
 (Coalition
 to
 Advance
 New
 Vac-
cines
 against
 group
 A
 Streptococcus)
 [44].
 The
 aim
 of
 CANVAS
 is
 to
evaluate
 potential
 GAS
 vaccine
 candidates
 for
 their
 potential
 to
 pro-
tect
 populations
 around
 the
 world
 with
 high
 rates
 of
 GAS
 diseases,
and
 to
 support
 the
 most
 promising
 candidate(s)
 through
 phase
 I

and
 II
 clinical
 trials
 and,
 hopefully,
 to
 an
 efficacy
 study
 against
 GAS
pharyngitis.
 The
 Initiative
 is
 also
 developing
 a
 core
 set
 of
 GAS
 strains
that
 a
 candidate
 vaccine
 should
 demonstrate
 protection
 against,
and
 an
 independent
 functional
 antibody
 assay
 that
 can
 be
 used
 for
all
 GAS
 vaccines
 in
 development.
 This
 will
 coincide
 with
 an
 eco-
nomic
 evaluation
 to
 make
 a
 case
 for
 investment
 in
 a
 GAS
 vaccine,
and
 work
 to
 engage
 industry
 partners
 and
 international
 agencies
in
 the
 hope
 that
 demonstration
 of
 feasibility
 and
 safety
 of
 a
 GAS
vaccine
 will
 encourage
 further
 investment
 to
 ensure
 a
 vaccine
 is
made
 available.
Moving
 forward
 it
 will
 be
 important
 to
 gain
 the
 interest
 and
support
 of
 funders
 with
 a
 track
 record
 in
 supporting
 vaccine
 devel-
opment
 for
 organisms
 that
 cause
 a
 significant
 burden
 of

 in
low
 and
 middle

 as
