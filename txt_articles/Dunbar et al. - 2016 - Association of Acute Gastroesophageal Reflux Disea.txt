Abstract
Importance—The histologic changes associated with acute gastroesophageal reflux disease 
(GERD) have not been studied prospectively in humans. Recent studies in animals have 
challenged the traditional notion that reflux esophagitis develops when esophageal surface 
epithelial cells are exposed to lethal chemical injury from refluxed acid.
Objective—To evaluate histologic features of esophageal inflammation in acute GERD to study 
its pathogenesis.
Design—Patients with reflux esophagitis healed by proton pump inhibitors (PPIs) had 24-hour 
esophageal pH/impedance monitoring and esophagoscopy [including confocal laser 
endomicroscopy (CLE)] with biopsies from non-eroded areas of distal esophagus at baseline (on

 PPIs), 1 and 2 weeks after stopping PPIs. Enrollment began May 2013, follow-up ended July 
2015.
Setting—Single-site, VA hospital.
Participants—Patients with prior reflux esophagitis and esophageal healing documented at 
baseline esophagoscopy.
Intervention—PPIs stopped for 2 weeks.
Main Outcome and Measures—Twelve patients (11 men, mean age 57.6±13.1 years) 
completed the study. Primary outcome was change in esophageal inflammation 2 weeks after 
stopping the PPI, determined by comparing lymphocyte, eosinophil, and neutrophil infiltrates 
(each scored on a 0–3 scale) in esophageal biopsies. Also evaluated were changes in epithelial 
basal cell and papillary hyperplasia, surface erosions, intercellular space width, endoscopic grade 
of esophagitis, esophageal acid exposure and mucosal impedance (an index of mucosal integrity).
Results—At 1 and 2 weeks after discontinuation of the PPI, biopsies showed significant 
increases in intraepithelial lymphocytes, which were predominantly T cells [median 0 (range 0–2) 
at baseline to 1 (range 1–2) at both 1 and 2 weeks, p<0.01]; neutrophils and eosinophils were few 
or absent. Biopsies also showed widening of intercellular spaces (confirmed by CLE), and basal 
cell and papillary hyperplasia developed without surface erosions. Two weeks after stopping the 
PPI, esophageal acid exposure increased (median 1.2% to 17.8% of the monitoring period, 
Δ=16.2%; 95%CI 4.4–26.5%, p=.005), mucosal impedance decreased (mean 2671.3 to 1508.4 Ω, 
Δ=1162.9; 95%CI 629.9–1695.9, p=.001), and all patients had evidence of esophagitis.
Conclusions and Relevance—In this preliminary study of 12 patients with severe reflux 
esophagitis responsive to PPI therapy, stopping PPIs was associated with T-lymphocyte-
predominant esophageal inflammation, and basal cell and papillary hyperplasia without loss of 
surface cells. If replicated, these findings suggest that the pathogenesis of reflux esophagitis may 
be cytokine-mediated rather than the result of chemical injury.
Trial Registration—Clinicaltrials.Gov Identifier: NCT01733810
Approximately 20% of adult Americans have symptoms of gastroesophageal reflux disease 
(GERD).1 The conceptual framework for GERD pathogenesis emerged from a 1935 JAMA 
report by Winkelstein that described patients with heartburn and inflammation in the distal 
esophagus, and proposed that they had “peptic esophagitis…resulting from the irritant action 
on the mucosa of free hydrochloric acid and pepsin.”2 This concept, that reflux esophagitis 
develops as an acid-peptic “burn”, has been largely unchallenged. The esophageal histologic 
abnormalities thought to be typical of GERD (basal cell hyperplasia, elongation of 
connective tissue papillae, infiltration by neutrophils and eosinophils) have been attributed to 
refluxed gastric acid-related chemical injury to esophageal epithelial cells starting at the 
luminal surface. The acid-induced death of surface cells is assumed to stimulate hyperplasia 
of basal progenitor cells, make papillae appear elongated, and attract granulocytes.3–6
An earlier study in rats found that reflux esophagitis did not develop as a chemical injury 
starting at the epithelial surface, but rather began with a submucosal infiltration by 
lymphocytes that later progressed upward to the epithelial surface.7 Basal cell hyperplasia

 and papillary elongation were observed to precede surface cell damage, and it was noted that 
brief exposures to acid and bile salts did not kill human esophageal cells in culture, but 
stimulated them to secrete inflammatory cytokines.7,8 Thus, an alternative concept for 
GERD pathogenesis was proposed in which refluxed gastric juice did not damage 
esophageal epithelial cells directly, but stimulated them to secrete cytokines that attracted 
immune cells, which ultimately damaged the mucosa.7
Patients typically have GERD symptoms for years before seeing a physician,9 and early 
features of reflux esophagitis have not been evaluated prospectively in humans. Studies have 
shown that erosive esophagitis healed by proton pump inhibitors (PPIs) usually returns 
within 6 to 12 months after stopping PPIs,10,11 but the rapidity with which esophagitis 
redevelops is not clear. We hypothesized that acute reflux esophagitis could be induced by 
briefly interrupting PPI therapy in patients with severe erosive esophagitis healed by PPIs. 
The aim of this study was to evaluate the histologic features of esophageal inflammatory 
changes in acute GERD.
Methods
This study was approved by Dallas VA Medical Center’s Institutional Review Board. 
Patients provided written informed consent and were compensated for study participation.
Study Population and Design
Dallas VA’s endoscopy database was searched for patients with Los Angeles grade C (LA-
C) reflux esophagitis diagnosed between December 2011 and January 2014 (LA Grades: 
0=no esophagitis, A=≥1 mucosal break ≤5 mm long not extending between mucosal folds, 
B=≥1 mucosal break >5 mm long not extending between mucosal folds, C=≥1 mucosal 
break continuous between the tops of ≥2 mucosal folds, involving <75% of the 
circumference, D=≥1 mucosal break involving ≥75% of the circumference).12 Two 
gastroenterologists (KBD, SJS) reviewed endoscopic images, and invited patients with 
verified LA-C esophagitis to participate. Exclusion criteria included history of esophageal 
varices, esophageal or gastric surgery, non-GERD esophageal disease, coagulopathy, 
anticoagulant usage, pregnancy, and comorbidity precluding safe participation. Enrollment 
began May 2013; follow-up ended July 2015.
Patients with LA-C esophagitis were treated with PPI BID for ≥1 month (Figure 1). On 
study day 1, patients took their morning PPI and completed the GERD-Health Related 
Quality of Life (HRQL) questionnaire [a validated instrument for GERD symptom severity, 
possible scores 0 (no symptoms) to 50 (worst symptoms)].13 Esophageal manometry and 24-
hour pH/impedance monitoring were performed with pH electrode positioned 5 cm above 
lower esophageal sphincter (LES). Patients took PPI that evening and next morning, when 
esophagoscopy was performed using both high-definition white light endoscopy (HD-WLE, 
Olympus Medical) and confocal laser endomicroscopy (CLE, Pentax Medical). Patients with 
LA-B, C or D esophagitis were not eligible for further study. Patients with no esophagitis or 
LA-A esophagitis had 4 esophageal biopsies obtained 1–3 cm proximal to squamo-columnar 
junction (SCJ) for histologic evaluation. PPIs were then stopped; patients were given 
antacids for heartburn. On day 9, esophagoscopy was performed for LA grading and biopsy.

 On day 15, patients completed another GERD HRQL questionnaire and had pH/impedance 
monitoring. The next day, esophagoscopy was performed for LA grading and biopsy, and 
patients resumed PPI therapy. During the second and third esophagoscopy, care was 
exercised to avoid taking biopsies from prior biopsy sites or mucosal breaks.
CLE Procedures
During CLE, which provides 1000-fold magnification of esophageal mucosa, patients were 
given fluorescein sodium (5 ml) intravenously to enhance identification of cells and 
capillaries. Images were acquired from distal (1–3 cm above SCJ) and proximal esophagus 
(10 cm above SCJ). After the procedure, one investigator (KBD) who was blinded to 
procedure time point reviewed all images, and chose two from proximal and distal 
esophagus that were technically best suited for intercellular space and capillary width 
measurements by ImageJ 1.48 software (NIH, Bethesda, Maryland) using the mean of 10 
measurements of the widest intercellular spaces seen, and of any capillaries seen.
Resting Esophageal Mucosal Impedance
Resting esophageal mucosal impedance reflects electrical conductivity of the esophageal 
wall, and is an index of mucosal integrity.14–16 Resting impedance was measured at the start 
of each impedance/pH monitoring period, at a level 5 cm above LES.
Histologic Procedures
Histologic features were assessed by consensus of two study pathologists (ATA, RDO) 
blinded to endoscopic order and findings. Formalin-fixed, H&E-stained biopsies were 
scored on a 0–3 scale (0=absent, 1=mild, 2=moderate, 3=severe) for: a) type and degree of 
epithelial inflammation (lymphocytes, eosinophils, neutrophils), b) basal cell and papillary 
hyperplasia, and c) spongiosis (dilated intercellular spaces). In the absence of a validated 
system for scoring inflammation in esophageal biopsies, our study pathologist (RDO) chose 
to use this scale because he had used a similar, stepwise 4-point grading system for scoring 
inflammatory activity in the colon in an earlier publication.17 (Note: the study protocol 
mistakenly specified use of a 0–4 scale, but the study pathologists used a 0–3 scale to score 
inflammation.) Quantitative assessment of inflammatory cell density was performed by 
counting peak number of lymphocytes, neutrophils, and eosinophils per high power field 
(HPF, 40× = 0.238mm2) in each of the three most representative and best-oriented biopsy 
fragments. Immunoperoxidase studies were performed on a Leica Bond III autostainer, 
using Polymer Refine Detection Kit (cat# DS9800) and heat-induced epitope retrieval 
(HIER) using either Bond Epitope Retrieval Solution 1, pH 6.0 (cat #AR9961) or Solution 2, 
pH 9.0 (cat# AR9640) for pan-T cell marker CD3 (Dako A0452, HIER 2 for 20 minutes, 
1:250) and B cell marker CD20 (Dako M0755, HIER 1 for 30 minutes, 1:500). Slides were 
incubated in primary antibody for 30 minutes, followed by secondary polymer for 15 
minutes. DAB (3,3′-diaminobenzidine) was used for visualization.
Outcomes
The study protocol did not clearly specify primary and secondary outcomes, and cited study 
purpose as “to elucidate the early histological events in the pathogenesis of reflux

 esophagitis in patients with GERD, and to correlate those events with esophageal expression 
of HIF-2α and pro-inflammatory cytokines, and with changes in esophageal proliferation”. 
ClinicalTrials.Gov cites study purpose as “to determine the role of HIF-2α on the production 
of inflammatory cytokines that lead to reflux esophagitis,” and lists the primary and 
secondary outcome measures as “Change in esophageal inflammation from baseline to 14 
days” and “Change in HIF-2α levels from baseline to 14 days”, respectively. However, this 
report describes only clinical study findings. Molecular studies on HIF-2α, pro-
inflammatory cytokines, and esophageal proliferation are in progress and will be described 
in future reports.
To determine change in esophageal inflammation histologically, lymphocytic, eosinophilic, 
and neutrophilic infiltration in esophageal biopsies (scored on the 0–3 scale described 
above) at baseline, 1 week and 2 weeks were compared. In addition, changes in GERD-
HRQL symptom scores, esophageal acid exposure (% total time esophageal pH<4), 
endoscopic grade of esophagitis, esophageal mucosal impedance, and changes in epithelial 
basal cell and papillary hyperplasia, spongiosis, surface erosions, and intercellular space 
width were evaluated. These were listed as “procedures to be performed” in the study 
protocol, but were not specified as outcome measures.
Statistical Methods
Continuous parameters are reported as mean ± standard deviation, ordinal parameters as 
median and range, discrete parameters as N and percent. Continuous dependent variables 
were tested for normality with Shapiro-Wilk test. Normally distributed continuous 
parameters were compared with paired samples t tests and repeated measures MANOVA 
with LSD multiple comparisons. Non-normally distributed continuous parameters and 
ordinal parameters were compared with Wilcoxon signed-rank and Friedman tests. Binary 
dependent variables were tested with repeated measures logistic regression (generalized 
linear models with logit functions). Analyses were performed with SPSS 22.0 for Windows. 
Study alpha was 0.05, with all tests reflecting two-tailed comparisons.
Sample Size Calculation and Power Analysis
The study protocol specified that a power analysis performed using SAS 9.2 indicated that 
12 participants were required to achieve study aims, based on a one-sample repeated 
measures analysis of inflammation over time with an anticipated effect size of 80%, a study 
alpha of .05, beta of .10, two-tailed. “Effect size of 80%” meant that no histologic evidence 
of esophageal inflammation (grade 0) was anticipated in any patient at baseline, and some 
degree of histologic inflammation (grade 1–3) was expected in 80% of patients by 2 weeks 
after stopping PPIs. These estimates were based on studies in an animal model of reflux 
esophagitis, and on studies of GERD patients who redeveloped esophagitis within 6–12 
months of stopping PPIs.7,10,11 An attrition rate of 40% (due to dropouts, inability to remain 
off PPIs, esophagitis on initial endoscopy, etc.) was estimated, and enrollment of up to 30 
patients was planned in order to have 12 complete the study.

 Results
Endoscopy database review identified 215 patients diagnosed with LA-C esophagitis (Figure 
2); 159 were eliminated by initial screening and 56 were invited to participate; 40 declined. 
Attrition rate was lower than estimated; it was necessary to enroll only 16 patients to attain 
12 who completed the study; 3 patients were excluded because baseline endoscopy showed 
LA-B esophagitis, 1 was withdrawn for an adverse event unrelated to study procedures. 
Enrollment was terminated when the 12th patient completed study procedures. Among the 
12 study patients (11 men, mean age 57.6±13.1 years), 8 took pantoprazole 40 mg BID and 
4 took omeprazole 40 mg BID during the month before study procedures.
GERD Symptoms, Esophageal Acid Exposure, Mucosal Impedance, and Endoscopic 
Findings
GERD-HRQL symptom scores increased from median of 2 at baseline on PPIs to 11.5 at 2 
weeks off PPIs (median Δ=4.5; 95%CI: 2.0–12.0; p=.008) (Table 1). Esophageal pH 
monitoring data were available both at baseline and 2 weeks off PPIs for 10 of the 12 
patients. Acid exposure increased from median 1.2% of the monitoring period at baseline to 
17.8% two weeks off PPIs (median Δ=16.2%; 95%CI: 4.4–26.5%, p=.005). Mucosal 
impedance decreased from mean 2671.3 Ω at baseline to 1508.4 Ω 2 weeks off PPIs 
(Δ=1162.9; 95%CI: 629.9–1695.9, p=.001).
At baseline, 11 of 12 patients had no visible esophagitis; 1 had LA-A esophagitis (Table 1). 
Off PPIs, esophagitis grade increased in 10 patients by week 1, and in 11 by week 2; 5 
developed severe (LA-C) esophagitis (Figure 3a). By assigning numerical values to LA 
grades (0=0, A=1, B=2, C=3), it was determined that esophagitis increased significantly 
from baseline (median 0) to week 1 (median 1.5, p=.006), and from week 1 to week 2 
(median 2, p=.02).
Histologic Findings and CLE Measurements
At baseline, there was minimal histologic inflammation (Table 2, Figure 3b–d). One and two 
weeks off PPIs, significant increases were noted in ordinal (0–3) histologic scores for 
intraepithelial lymphocytic infiltration [median 0 (range 0–2) to 1 (range 1–2), p<0.01], 
basal cell and papillary hyperplasia [median 0.5 (range 0–1) to 2 (range 1–3), p<0.01], and 
spongiosis [median 0.5 (range 0–1) to 2 (range 1–3), p<0.01]. Neutrophils were found only 
in infrequent areas of micro-erosion; the median maximum number of neutrophils/HPF in 
any biopsy specimen at any time was 0 (range 0–31). Eosinophils also were few in number 
in most patients at all time points; the median maximum number of intraepithelial 
eosinophils/HPF in any biopsy specimen at any time was 1.5 (range 0–9). Lymphocytes 
were the predominant inflammatory cell type at all time points; the median maximum 
number of intraepithelial lymphocytes/HPF in any biopsy at any time was 51.5 (range 26–
163). Immunostaining showed that these lymphocytes were almost exclusively CD3+ T cells 
(eFigure 1).
After stopping PPIs, CLE revealed dilated intercellular spaces containing increased amounts 
of fluorescein (Figure 3a). At weeks 1 and 2, intercellular space width in proximal and distal

 esophagus, and capillary width in distal esophagus had increased significantly from baseline 
values (Table 2).
Discussion
In patients with severe erosive reflux esophagitis healed by PPIs, this study showed that 
interrupting PPI therapy was followed by rapid development of acute GERD associated with 
a significant increase in esophageal acid exposure and significant decrease in mucosal 
integrity. Within one week of stopping PPIs, most patients redeveloped erosive esophagitis 
associated with dilation of esophageal intercellular spaces and capillaries. Histologically, 
this acute GERD was a T-lymphocyte predominant form of inflammation, with minimal 
involvement by neutrophils and eosinophils. Furthermore, esophageal basal cell and 
papillary hyperplasia developed in areas without surface erosions. If the traditional notion 
were true, that acute GERD is caused by refluxed acid directly inflicting lethal, chemical 
injury to surface epithelial cells, then basal cell and papillary hyperplasia would have been 
expected only in areas with surface erosions, and the infiltrating inflammatory cells would 
have been granulocytes primarily.6
Apical membranes of esophageal squamous epithelial cells are highly impermeable to 
hydrogen ions, unlike their basolateral membranes, which are highly acid-permeable.18 
According to the traditional notion of GERD pathogenesis, esophagitis starts when refluxed 
acid and pepsin initiate damage to proteins of junctional structures binding esophageal 
epithelial cells to one another.19,20 These structures normally form a barrier to paracellular 
diffusion of acid and, when damaged, refluxed acid can diffuse into intercellular spaces to 
enter epithelial cells through their vulnerable basolateral membranes. Once inside 
esophageal cells, acid was thought to kill them by denaturing vital proteins, by activating 
phospholipases and endonucleases, and by interfering with cell respiration.21,22 This lethal 
acid injury was assumed to start at the esophageal luminal surface, inducing an acute 
inflammatory response characterized by epithelial infiltration with granulocytes. The acid-
induced death of surface cells was assumed to stimulate hyperplasia of squamous basal 
progenitor cells and to be associated with elongated and hyperplastic papillae.3,5 With 
persistent reflux inducing more epithelial cell death, inflammation was thought to progress 
into lamina propria and, with ulceration, into submucosa.6 Thus, acute reflux esophagitis 
was assumed to develop as an acid-peptic burn progressing from luminal surface through to 
submucosa. However, this pattern of injury was not observed in the present study.
The results of this study in GERD patients are consistent with those described in our report 
on a rat model of reflux esophagitis in which we proposed that refluxed gastric juice might 
not damage the esophagus directly, but rather incited a cytokine-mediated inflammatory 
response that ultimately caused esophageal damage.7 Elevated esophageal levels of pro-
inflammatory cytokines have been found in GERD patients, although it remains unclear 
whether those cytokines are a cause or effect of esophageal inflammation.23–27 In our earlier 
studies, we found that acidic bile salts stimulated human esophageal squamous epithelial 
cells in culture to secrete potent pro-inflammatory cytokines [interleukin (IL)-8 and IL-1β], 
and that conditioned media from those cells increased migration of inflammatory cells in a 
transwell assay system.7,8 Cytokines like IL-8 and IL-1β also have pro-proliferative

 effects,28,29 which might have contributed to esophageal basal cell and papillary hyperplasia 
observed in the absence of surface erosions. In esophageal epithelial cells in culture, 
moreover, PPIs inhibit secretion of IL-8 through acid-independent mechanisms.8,30 This 
observation raises the interesting possibility that anti-inflammatory PPI effects, independent 
of their effects on acid inhibition, might contribute to GERD healing by PPIs.
In the present study, biopsies were taken purposely from areas of distal esophagus that had 
no visible erosions. Biopsies of eroded areas undoubtedly would have revealed prominent 
neutrophilic infiltrates, which develop in erosions of virtually any etiology.31 The finding of 
neutrophils in such biopsies would provide no useful information about the pathogenesis of 
the erosions. Biopsies of non-eroded esophageal epithelium after PPI interruption revealed 
infiltration by T-lymphocytes with basal cell hyperplasia and papillary elongation, consistent 
with the proposal that acute GERD is primarily a cytokine-mediated process.7 Further 
studies are needed to establish that cytokines are indeed the cause of the histologic changes 
observed, but our findings suggest that those changes do not appear to be caused by acid-
induced death of surface cells.
Dilation of esophageal intercellular spaces is a characteristic GERD feature, and 
intercellular space dilation was observed (by CLE and histology) as reflux esophagitis 
progressed in study patients. It has been proposed that this dilation results from an acid-
induced increase in epithelial permeability that enables Cl− and water in the esophageal 
lumen to enter and expand the intercellular space.32 The CLE observation that GERD is 
associated with an increase in blood-borne fluorescein in intercellular spaces raises the 
possibility that reflux-induced esophageal inflammation might increase esophageal vascular 
permeability. If so, then leakage of fluid from inflammation-damaged esophageal blood 
vessels also might contribute to dilation of intercellular spaces in GERD.
There are limitations to this study. Most of the eligible patients declined to participate in this 
rigorous protocol. The study included only patients with severe (LA-C) reflux esophagitis 
whose esophagitis had been healed by PPIs; 11 of the 12 patients were men, and all had 
hiatal hernias. Among individuals with typical GERD symptoms, <50% have endoscopic 
evidence of reflux esophagitis, and <20% of those have esophagitis of LA-C grade 
severity.33,34 Thus, it is not clear that findings in the study patients are applicable to the 
general population of patients with GERD of lesser severity. Study patients had recurrent, 
acute GERD induced by stopping PPIs, and it is not clear that findings in those patients are 
applicable to new-onset GERD occurring spontaneously in untreated individuals. In 
addition, there was subjectivity involved in choosing CLE images for analysis, which might 
have introduced bias in interpretation of the CLE data. Finally, it is possible that the drop in 
mucosal impedance after stopping PPIs was caused by liquid in the esophageal lumen rather 
than by impairment of mucosal integrity.
Conclusions
In this preliminary study of 12 patients with severe reflux esophagitis responsive to PPI 
therapy, stopping PPIs was associated with T-lymphocyte-predominant esophageal 
inflammation, and basal cell and papillary hyperplasia without loss of surface cells. If

cytokine-mediated rather than the result of chemical injury.

 breaks (4 and 6 o’clock positions) extending up the esophagus from the gastroesophageal 
junction (LA-B esophagitis). At week 2, HD-WLE shows long mucosal breaks continuous 
between the tops of mucosal folds (LA-C esophagitis). CLE reveals fluorescein within 
bright intraepithelial capillaries (yellow arrows), with fluorescein that leaked from blood 
vessels into intercellular spaces surrounding individual cells, creating a reticular appearance 
characteristic of squamous epithelium. CLE measurements revealed widened intercellular 
spaces with increased intercellular fluorescein at weeks 1 and 2. 3b–d. Photomicrographs of 
biopsies of the distal esophagus in the same patient: 3b) at baseline, 3c) at one week after 
stopping PPIs; arrows point to some of the numerous intraepithelial lymphocytes, and 3d) at 
two weeks after stopping PPIs; note the prominent lymphocytosis, basal cell hyperplasia and 
papillary elongation (all photomicrographs H&E, original magnification ×20). All images 
were manipulated in Photoshop to remove patient identification data, and to enhance clarity. 
Any adjustments in contrast, color balance, brightness or sharpness were applied to the 
entire image.

Baseline values are presented in the shaded columns. NA=data not available for technical reasons.
GERD-HRQL is a validated instrument used to assess the symptomatic response to GERD treatments.13 The patient is asked to rank 10 GERD symptom questions (e.g. How bad is your heartburn? Does 
heartburn wake you from sleep?) on a scale of 0 (no symptoms) to 5 (incapacitating symptoms); thus, the possible range of scores is 0 to 50. No minimally important difference in GERD-HRQL scores has 
been defined. In clinical trials, a positive outcome generally is defined as ≥50% improvement in GERD-HRQL scores.35
Esophageal impedance (electrical resistance) was measured at the start of the monitoring period at a level 5 cm above the LES.
LA endoscopic esophagitis grades: 0=no esophagitis, A=≥1 mucosal break ≤5 mm long not extending between the tops of mucosal folds, B=≥1 mucosal break >5 mm long not extending between the tops of 
mucosal folds, C=≥1 mucosal break continuous between the tops of ≥2 mucosal folds, involving <75% of the circumference. For statistical comparisons, numerical values were assigned to LA grades (0=0, 
A=1, B=2, C=3).

§Due to technical difficulties in identifying the LES in this patient, the pH electrode was inadvertently positioned in the stomach rather than the esophagus. This incorrect positioning also resulted in 
spurious values for impedance. Consequently, these data were not included in the group analysis of the pH monitoring and impedance results.

aHistologic findings are scored on a scale of 0–3 (0=absent, 1=mild, 2=moderate, 3=severe). Comparisons were made using Wilcoxon signed-rank tests.
bTechnical issues (excessive motion artifact, equipment malfunction, patient inability to tolerate the large CLE endoscope) precluded obtaining CLE measurements in all patients at all time points. CLE 
measurements were made using ImageJ 1.48 software (National Institutes of Health, Bethesda, Maryland). Comparisons were made using paired samples t-tests.
