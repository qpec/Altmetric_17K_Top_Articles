Incidence of subarachnoid hemorrhage is
decreasing together with decreasing
smoking rates
ABSTRACT
Objective: To determine the nationwide incidence of subarachnoid hemorrhage (SAH) and report
nationwide changes in smoking rates between 1998 and 2012 in Finland.
Methods: In this register-based study, we utilized the nationwide Causes of Death Register and
Hospital Discharge Register in identifying SAH events between 1998 and 2012. Population
statistics in Finland, which were obtained through a database of Statistics Finland, were used
to calculate crude annual incidence rates of SAH. For the direct age standardization of crude inci-
dence rates, we used the European Standard Population (ESP) 2013. Data on changes in nation-
wide smoking rates between 1998 and 2012 were extracted from a database of the National
Institute for Health and Welfare.
Results: For the total of 79,083,579 cumulative person-years, we identified 6,885 people with
SAH. Sudden deaths from SAH away from hospitals or in emergency rooms accounted for 1,771
(26%) of the events. Crude nationwide annual incidence rates varied between 6.2 and 10.0 per
100,000 persons, and increased by age particularly in women. Among 70- to 75-year-old
women, the incidence of SAH was highest (22.5 per 100,000 persons). The 3-year average of
ESP standardized incidence decreased 24% from 11.7 in 1998–2000 to 8.9 per 100,000
persons in 2010–2012. Daily smoking decreased 30% between 1998 and 2012.
Conclusions: The incidence of SAH seems to be decreasing. This tendency may be coupled with
changes in smoking rates. The incidence of SAH in Finland is similar to other Nordic countries.

International Classification of Diseases–10; SAH 5 subarachnoid hemorrhage.
Subarachnoid hemorrhage (SAH) has a 1-year case-fatality of close to 50%.1 Because a sub-
stantial number of SAH patients die suddenly away from hospitals or in emergency rooms,1 and
few countries have high autopsy rates for sudden deaths to confirm the diagnosis, reports of
nationwide incidence rates of SAH are scarce.
The purpose of this study was to determine the nationwide incidence of SAH in Finland for
the first time. As smoking, the most important lifestyle risk factor for SAH,2–4 is likely to
contribute to the incidence of SAH, we also tried to report changes in smoking rates in Finland.
Finally, since the incidence of SAH in Finland is reported to be exceptionally high,5–8 and this
has led, for example, to the exclusion of Finnish studies from SAH risk prediction models,5 we
compared Finnish incidence rates with those population-based or nationwide risk estimates,
which have included sudden deaths away from hospitals in their analyses.
METHODS Standard protocol approvals, registrations, and patient consents. Approvals for this register-based study were
obtained from Statistics Finland and the National Institute for Health and Welfare. The National Institute for Health and Welfare
accomplished the linkage of the nationwide Hospital Discharge Register (HDR) and the nationwide Causes of Death Register
(CDR). According to Finnish and European Union legislation, linkages of nationwide registries and subsequent register-based

Register-based identification of SAH patients. Using the
ICD-10, we retrieved data from the HDR, maintained by
the National Institute for Health and Welfare, and from the
nationwide CDR, maintained by Statistics Finland, on all persons
listed with the primary diagnosis of SAH (ICD-10 codes I60.1-
I60.9), like previously.1,2,9 With regard to the nationwide HDR,
the cohort included all emergency admissions to any health
care facilities due to SAH. People dying away from hospitals
or in emergency rooms were classified as sudden deaths, not as
hospital-admitted patients. In an attempt to decrease the
likelihood
of
reporting
inaccurate
incidence
rates
for
aneurysmal SAH, we excluded SAHs coded as undefined or
nonaneurysmal SAHs (I60.7-I60.9). We also excluded patients
with secondary diagnoses of arteriovenous malformations
(Q28*) or intracranial injuries (S06*) from the final SAH
cohort. Since the ICD-10 diagnostic codes were introduced
in 1996 in Finland, we omitted the data of the first 2 years,
as the possibility of diagnostic inaccuracies in the early years is
theoretically higher. The final data were collected from the
time

1998
and

Welfare linked and anonymized the personal data on the
HDR and CDR.
Accuracy of register-based diagnosis of SAH. The accuracy
of the register-based diagnosis of SAH has been reported
previously, and the agreement rate and sensitivity are 89%–
92%, respectively, in the HDR.4,10 The agreement rate of SAH
diagnosis in the Finnish CDR is 95%.10,11
Incidence of SAH. Incidence rates are expressed as cases per
100,000 persons. We calculated the nationwide crude annual
incidence rates by dividing the total number of SAHs by the
annual total population in Finland. The 5-year age group
population numbers were retrieved from Statistics Finland. We
calculated the European age-standardized (European Standard
Population [ESP] 2013) annual incidence rates by first multiplying
the age-specific rates of SAH by age-specific weights (the weights
used in the age adjustment were the proportions of the ESP by
each age group), and then we summed the weighted rates across
the age groups to give the ESP-adjusted rates. Rates were
computed overall and by sex. For estimating changes in incidence
rates, we used 3-year average figures, like in a previous nationwide
study.12 Since the presented incidence rates are nationwide rates,
not based on selected subpopulations, we omitted reporting of
confidence intervals. For estimating the statistical significance of
changes in incidence rates, we used the Poisson regression analysis.
Data collection on smoking between 1998 and 2012. We
extracted data on smoking in Finland from open-access public
Websites (thl.fi/en_US/web/en/statistics/topics/tobacco) of the
National Institute for Health and Welfare.
Statistical analyses. We used Stata statistical software (version
13.1; Stata Corp, College Station, TX) in analyses.
RESULTS SAH patients in 1998–2012. For the total of
79,083,579 cumulative person-years, the register-based
search found data on 6,990 persons with a primary
diagnosis of SAH (I60.0-I60.9). Of these, 6,912
(98.9%) had a primary diagnosis of aneurysmal SAH
(I60.0-I60.6).

 or intracranial injuries, the final cohort included 6,885
(98.5%) persons with SAH (table 1). Of these, one-
fourth died suddenly (table 1). Of the 1,771 people
dying suddenly, 54.9% were women. The median ages
for women and men were 60 and 54 years at the time
of SAH. The median age for all SAH cases increased
during the study period (table 1).
Based on the ICD-10 codes, internal carotid artery
and middle cerebral artery aneurysms accounted for
16.2% and 35.3% of aneurysmal SAHs. Anterior
communicating artery and posterior communication
artery aneurysms accounted for 23.5% and 6.0% of
SAHs. Basilar artery and vertebral artery aneurysms
caused SAH in 9.7% and 2.9% of the cases.
Incidence of SAH in 1998–2012. Table 1 and figure 1
depict the annual crude and ESP standardized incidences
of SAH. The incidence decreased over time (table 1 and
figure 1). According to the Poisson regression analysis,
the average annual incidence decrease of 2.1% between
1998 and 2012 was significant (annual incidence rate
ratio 0.979, 95% confidence interval 0.974–0.985). The
3-year average of the ESP incidence was 11.7 between
1998 and 2000, but decreased 24% to 8.9 per 100,000
persons in 2010–2012. The 3-year average of the crude
incidence decreased by 45% in women younger than 50
years between the time periods 1998–2000 and 2010–
2012, and by 38% in age-matched men. In the older
age group, of 50 years and older, the 3-year average of
the crude incidence decreased less (16% in women and
26% in men) between the same 2 time periods. In
general, the crude incidence increased by age, being
highest in the age group of 75–80 years (table 2).
The female-to-male ratio remained relatively constant
(close to 1:1) until age 65 years, after which the ratio
increased with increasing age (table 2).
Smoking between 1998 and 2012. Since 1998, the num-
ber of daily smokers has gradually decreased (figure 2),
and in 2012, 17% of Finns aged between 15 and 64
years smoked daily. Men used to smoke daily substan-
tially more often than women (figure 2). The percentage
of daily smokers among high school students aged 15–17
years decreased 44% from 19% in 2000 to 11% in 2011
among girls, and 41% from 18% to 10% among boys
(sotkanet.fi/sotkanet/en/index?).
DISCUSSION Over a time period of 15 years, we
observed a decrease in the annual ESP standardized
nationwide incidence of SAH in Finland. The crude
incidence rates decreased especially in women youn-
ger than 50 years. As the incidence of SAH decreased
in the relatively short time period and especially in
younger age groups, declining smoking rates may

 partly explain the observed changes. During the study
period, the percentage of daily smokers (aged 15–64
years) decreased 30% in Finland, and the decrease
was particularly evident among high school students.
Between 1997 and 2007, however, blood pressure
values decreased in Finland,13,14 as well.
Smoking rates and the prevalence of hypertension
decreased already in the 1970s and 1980s, when these
risk factor changes were estimated to account for 29%
of a substantial drop in the overall stroke figures in
Finland.15 At the same time with decreasing incidence
rates, the median age at diagnosis of SAH increased
by 6 years in the current study. Elimination of pre-
ventable risk factors in younger age groups may be
coupled with a decrease in incidence rates in the same
age groups, thus leading to an increase in the median
age at diagnosis.
Studies that report the incidence of SAH need to
include sudden deaths from SAH in incidence esti-
mates. Depending on the study year, one-fifth to
one-third of people with SAH died suddenly away
from hospitals or in emergency rooms. Autopsy rates
for sudden deaths are high in Finland,16 and higher
than in other Nordic countries.17 The autopsy rate is
the lowest in Norway,17 where the ESP standardized
incidence rate of SAH is also the lowest (8.7 per
100,000 person-years between 1984 and 2007).18
With regard to the changes in Nordic nationwide inci-
dence rates over time, the crude nationwide incidence
of SAH declined ;20% from 11.1 in 1999–2001 to
8.9 per 100,000 person-years in 2005–2007 in Nor-
way.12 In Sweden, the crude nationwide incidence rates
declined ;11% from 12.7 in 1987–1994 to 11.3 per
100,000 person-years in 1995–2002.19 The nationwide
ESP standardized incidence decreased from 13.8 in
1992 to 12.3 per 100,000 persons in 2002 in
Denmark.20
The reported incidence rates in Finland have been
somewhat inconsistent, depending on the study years,
study areas, and study methods. For example, a Finnish
study published in 1967 reported an incidence of 15.7
per 100,000 person-years in the capital area.21 In 1991,
Sarti et al.22 reported an exceptionally high incidence
rate of 29.8 per 100,000 person-years for 25- to
74-year-old Finnish people. This incidence rate was
much
higher
than
previously
published
figures
between 1975 and 1986.23–26 Fogelholm27 suggested
that the exclusion of nearly 40% of the population
(,25-year-old and .74-year-old people) resulted in
incomparable rates with earlier studies that included all
age groups. This proved to be so, as after an adjustment
to the Finnish population in 1986, the incidence rates
of 5 previous studies21–24,26 varied from 14.4 to 19.6
per 100,000 person-years.27 Inconsistent incidence
rates occur also in those previous studies, which report
changes in the Finnish incidence of SAH over time.
For example, according to a study covering only a few
small geographical areas (,10% of population) in Fin-
land, an age- and sex-adjusted incidence of SAH
decreased from 29.9 in 1972–1973 to 13.7 per
100,000 person-years in 1989–1991 among people
aged $15 years.28 Another small (,10% of popula-
tion) Finnish study, which was based on a prospective
stroke
registry
FINMONICA
and
its
successor
FINSTROKE, reported a steady ESP standardized
incidence rate of ;20 per 100,000 person-years for
25- to 74-year-old people between 1988 and 1997.29
When conducting meta-analyses, pooled studies, or
systematic reviews, such inconsistences in Finnish
population-based studies lead easily to inaccurate
nationwide incidence estimates, as discussed recently.30
The current study has some strengths in compar-
ison with previous population-based and nationwide
epidemiologic studies on SAH. Since the incidence
of SAH can vary between geographical areas,12,18,19
population-based incidence rates from a few hospitals
or hospital districts may be misleading. The current
study reports the first nationwide incidence of SAH
in Finland. Furthermore, we limited the study to the
time period when brain CT scans and ICD-10 clas-
sification were in routine use. By doing this, we pre-
sumed that the register-based study on the incidence
rates of aneurysmal SAH is accurate. In 2010, 141

 aneurysmal SAH patients were admitted to the Hel-
sinki University Hospital (based on the hospital’s
own registry), which has a catchment area of ;1.8
million people. Thus, the incidence of hospital-
admitted aneurysmal SAH was ;7.8 per 100,000
persons in 2010 in the Helsinki University Hospital
area. Taking into account sudden deaths (21% of
SAH cases in 2010), we can estimate that the incidence
of SAH was ;9.9 per 100,000 in 2010 in the Helsinki
University Hospital area. The nationwide ESP stan-
dardized incidence of SAH was approximately the
same, 10.1 per 100,000 in 2010 in the current study,
suggesting that our register-based search strategy
yielded reliable incidence figures. The most disap-
pointing shortcoming in our study is that smoking
habits and other risk factors could not be studied at
the individual level. This is a shortcoming common to
nationwide register-based epidemiologic studies, which
can poorly identify causal associations.
The incidence of SAH seems to be decreasing in
Finland. This decrease may be coupled with the
changes in smoking. The findings indirectly suggest
that primary prevention by means of health behavior
changes may have a significant effect on the incidence
of SAH in the future, and may therefore decrease the
population-wide cardiovascular disease burden in
many countries. Finally, the Finnish incidence rate
of SAH is similar to other Nordic countries.
Therefore, Finnish studies can provide important
and generalizable data on the epidemiology of SAH,
contrary to some previous beliefs.
