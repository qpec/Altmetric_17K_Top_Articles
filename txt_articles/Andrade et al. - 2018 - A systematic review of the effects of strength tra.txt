Abstract
Background: Fibromyalgia (FM) is characterized by chronic and generalized musculoskeletal pain. There is currently
no cure for FM, but palliative treatments are available. One type of treatment is strength training (ST). However,
there is a need for more information on optimal training protocols, intensity, and volume needed to improve
symptoms. The aim of this study was to analyze the effects of ST in the treatment of FM through a systematic
review of experimental research.
Methods: Medical Subject Headings search terms and electronic databases including Scientific Electronic Library
Online, PubMed, Science Direct, Web of Science, and Physiotherapy Evidence Database were used to identify
studies.
Results: The inclusion criteria were met by 22 eligible studies. Most of the studies were conducted in the United
States (36%), Finland (23%), Brazil (18%), and Sweden (18%). The studies showed that ST reduces the number of
tender points, fatigue, depression, and anxiety, and improves sleep quality and quality of life in patients with FM.
The intervention period ranged from 3 to 21 weeks, with sessions performed 2 times a week in 81.81% of the
studies, at initial intensities of 40% of 1-repetition maximum. The repetitions ranged from 4 to 20, with no specific
protocol defined for ST in FM.
Conclusion: The main results included reduction in pain, fatigue, number of tender points, depression, and anxiety,
with increased functional capacity and quality of life. Current evidence demonstrates that ST is beneficial and can
be used to treat FM.

Background
Fibromyalgia (FM) is a chronic disease characterized by
generalized skeletal muscle pain [1, 2], and other com-
mon symptoms include fatigue, sleep disorders, depres-
sion, and excessive anxiety [3–6]. The pathogenesis of
FM is still not well understood [7], and FM is
considered by some researchers to be a neurobiological
disease caused by abnormal processing of pain [8].
Owing to the lack of markers that can identify the dis-
ease, the diagnosis is made through clinical examin-
ation, according to the guidelines of the American
College of Rheumatology [1, 3].
As FM has no cure, treatments are palliative, and
multidisciplinary approaches involving the use of medi-
cations, physical exercise (PE), and psychological treat-
ments are recommended [4, 9–12]. PE has been advised
in several studies and guidelines for the treatment of FM

 [13–16], and the inclusion of aerobic, resistance, and
water exercises has been strongly recommended [5, 15–
17]. The severity of FM symptoms can affect the level of
physical fitness, and patients commonly perform little
physical activity because of pain [18–20].
The relationship between PE and FM has been investi-
gated, and strength training (ST) has been compared
with other PE modalities. Studies have shown that ST
has favorable results on pain, sleep, depression, and the
number of tender points [17, 21]. However, studies on
the effect of PE present poor quality evidence owing to
small sample sizes and methodological problems [22,
23]. Recent studies have attempted to better understand
the effects of ST in patients with FM [21, 24–26]. How-
ever, research has emphasized physical aspects with con-
flicting results [27, 28]. Despite recent research on the
effects of ST in patients with FM, the duration, fre-
quency, and intensity required to improve the symptoms
remain unknown because the protocols differ among
studies [29–31]. Thus, there is no consensus on the use
of ST in clinical practice. The aim of this study was to
analyze the effects of ST in the treatment of FM through
a systematic review of experimental research.
Methods
The present study followed the PRISMA (Preferred Report-
ing Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses)
guidelines [32]. The PRISMA Statement is a protocol that
guides the construction of systematic reviews in a transpar-
ent and consistent manner using a checklist of 27 items
and a 4-phase flow diagram [33]. This systematic review
was registered as CRD42016048480 in the International
Prospective Register of Systematic Reviews (PROSPERO)
[34]. A primary goal of PROSPERO is to make known the
intention to conduct a systematic review, in order to re-
duce duplication and to facilitate transparency in the re-
view process [35].
Eligibility criteria
In order to include the entire publication period, no
time limit was set. The eligibility criteria were deter-
mined according to the PICOS (Population, Interven-
tion, Comparison, Outcomes, Setting) strategy.
Population
Adults 18 years and older with a diagnosis of FM ac-
cording to the 1990 criteria of the American College of
Rheumatology (1).
Intervention
Any intervention with ST or resistance training for pa-
tients with FM was included. We excluded studies with
combined interventions, such as those with ST com-
bined with aerobic training.
Comparison
With any other type of group (such as sedentary con-
trols and healthy controls) and with other types of inter-
vention (such as aerobic exercise and flexibility exercise).
Outcomes
All possible effects of ST and the intervention protocols
used in the studies in patients with FM.
Type of study
Randomized or non-randomized trials reporting clinical
outcomes demonstrating the effects of ST. The fre-
quency of ST and the extent to which ST was provided
were the minimum necessary data for a research to be
defined as an intervention study. Revised articles, disser-
tations, theses, and congress abstracts were excluded.
Information sources
The studies were identified through electronic databases,
including PubMed, Science Direct, Web of Science,
Physiotherapy Evidence Database, and Scientific Elec-
tronic Library Online. The last survey was conducted in
December 2017.
Search strategy
The search terms were defined by the researchers using the
Medical Subject Headings (Table 1), and the search strat-
egy in the PubMed database is shown in Additional file 1.
Study identification
The searches and selection of articles were independ-
ently performed by 2 researchers; in case of disagree-
ment, a third party was asked to make the final decision.
An initial analysis was performed based on reading the
title. From these selected articles, the abstracts were read
and the articles included in the review were read in their
entirety. A review of the references and citations of these
articles was also carried out in order to identify other
potentially relevant studies. From the selected studies,
an analysis of the use of ST for the treatment of patients
with FM was performed.
Data extraction
For the analysis and discussion of the results, the follow-
ing data were extracted: author and study design; study
participant number, age, sex, and treatment group; type
of exercise, time of intervention, intensity, and adher-
ence (based on either the number of attending patients
at the beginning and end of the study or from data pro-
vided by the authors); and conclusions of the study.
Quality of study and risk of Bias
This systematic review evaluated the quality of the in-
cluded studies and the risk of bias using the Cochrane
Andrade et al. Advances in Rheumatology           (2018) 58:36 
Page 2 of 14
 Collaboration Risk of Bias tool [36], which includes cri-
teria to identify bias in the selected studies that can
interfere with the interpretation and conclusion. Bias
risk assessment was performed by 2 researchers. The
kappa concordance index [37] between the reviewers
for each of the criteria was determined, and differences
were resolved by consulting a third reviewer for a final
opinion.
Results
Identification and selection of studies
The first stage of selection using the databases identified
211 studies, with 1 additional study manually inserted.
Sixty-two duplicate studies were excluded and 48 ab-
stracts were selected after reading the titles. At the ab-
stract review stage, 17 studies were excluded, of which 9
used combined exercise, 7 were congress abstracts, and
1 did not evaluate patients with FM. In the fourth stage,
the complete texts of 31 studies were read; 5 were ex-
cluded because of the intervention protocol, 1 was a
short communication, and 1 was a congress article.
Thus, 22 studies were selected for the analysis, as shown
in Fig. 1.
Characteristics of included studies
Of the 22 studies included in the review, the oldest was
published in 2001 [38] and the most recent was pub-
lished in 2017 [24, 39, 40] (Table 2). Most of the studies
were conducted in the United States (36%, n = 8),
followed by Finland (23%, n = 5), Brazil (18%, n = 4),
Sweden (18%, n = 4), and Turkey (5%, n = 1). Women
aged 18–65 years comprised the total sample, and the
main variables analyzed were pain, strength, muscular
activity, functional capacity, fatigue, quality of life, and
sleep [24, 25, 27, 29, 38, 39, 41–44]. Among the tests
used in the evaluations, the Fibromyalgia Impact Ques-
tionnaire, which evaluates the impact of FM on quality
of life, was used in most of the studies [25, 27–29, 31,
45–48]. To measure strength, the 1-repetition maximum
(1RM) was the most used test [27–29, 31, 38, 49, 50]
and studies that verified muscle activity used electro-
myography [38, 41, 51–53]. The visual analogue scale
was used to evaluate pain in most of the studies [29, 41,
42, 45, 48, 53]. Concerning adherence, most of the stud-
ies did not provide this information. Therefore, adher-
ence was calculated based on the patients’ attendance,
and an average adherence percentage of 84% (range, 54–
100%) was obtained. Five studies provided the average
attendance rate, ranging from 71 to 100%.
Summary of evidence and practical implications
The analysis of the results revealed that ST reduced the
symptoms of patients with FM, such as pain, fatigue,
number of tender points, depression, and anxiety, with
improved functional capacity and quality of life [24, 25,
27, 29, 38, 39, 41, 42] (Table 2), despite the different
training protocols used.
When analyzing the training protocol, 81.81% of the
studies submitted the patients to interventions twice a
week, whereas only 13% (3 studies) submitted the pa-
tients to 3 sessions per week and 1 study verified the ef-
fect of a single session. Concerning the intervention
time, the shorter studies lasted for 3 weeks whereas the
longer studies lasted for 21 weeks. Most of the studies
had an intervention time of 21 (22.72%), 12 (22.72%), 16
(18.18%), and 15 (18.18%) weeks. The studies used simi-
lar training protocols, starting with 40% of 1RM and
progressing to 85%. During the training, exercises using
machines and free weights worked the large and small
muscle groups.
Pain was the most studied variable, showing a reduction
after ST [27, 29, 30, 45, 53–55]. No study reported in-
creased pain after or during the intervention period. Kayo
et al. [48] found at the end of 16 weeks of intervention
that only 41.4% of patients in the ST group were using
pain medication, whereas in 80% of the patients in the
control group regularly used pain medication. Other
well-analyzed variables were strength, quality of life, heart
rate variability (HRV), and depression. With regard to
muscle strength, increases between 33 and 63% were ob-
served after 21 and 16 weeks [41, 49]. In terms of the vari-
ability of heart rate, the effects of ST on patients with FM
presented controversial results; however, the evidence
shows little effect on this variable [49]. Studies analyzing
quality of life and functionality showed that ST is effective
in improving these variables [28, 29, 31, 41, 42, 45].
The most investigated psychological variable was de-
pression. The studies of Jones et al. [45], Gavi et al. [29],
and Assumpção et al. [40] showed that ST reduces de-
pressive symptoms; however, the study of Ericsson et al.
[25] did not find a significant difference after 15 weeks
of intervention.
We also analyzed the results related to sleep quality.
Andrade et al. [24] found that sleep disorders were re-
duced after ST and that sleep correlated with pain. The
results of Ericsson et al. [25] also disclosed that ST
yielded better results than relaxation sessions in improv-
ing sleep quality. In addition, another important result is
that patients with FM presented similar responses to

 those of healthy persons; thus, they recommended ST to
assist in the treatment of patients.
The intervention protocols, results, and conclusions of
each study are presented in Table 2.
Quality of studies and risk of Bias
The kappa concordance index between the two re-
viewers was 87.1% for all criteria. Of the 22 studies, 13
had low risk of adequate sequence generation bias; four
were unclear regarding the risk of adequate sequence
generation bias and six were not randomized. Only four
studies had low risk of allocation concealment bias. Ten
studies had a high risk of blinded participant bias; only
four had a low risk and eight were unclear. Twenty-one
studies presented low risk of incomplete data bias. Simi-
lar findings were noted for selective results bias; only
two studies were unclear. The descriptions of interven-
tions (characteristics of exercises) were another source
of bias, with only two studies having a high risk (Fig. 2).
Discussion
This systematic review aimed to analyze the efficacy of ST
in the treatment of FM by examining the existing experi-
mental research. The studies showed that the intervention

The ST led to large increases in maximal
force and EMG activity of the muscles
and contributed to the improvement in
loading performance (average load/set)
at week 21. The fatiguing loading
sessions typically applied in strength
training before and after the
experimental period caused remarkable
and comparable acute decreases in
maximal force and increases in blood
lactate concentration in both groups.
Acute exercise-induced muscle pain
increased similarly in both groups, and
the pain level in women with FM was
lowered after the 21-week training
period.
An increase in maximal strength,

Aortic and digital diastolic blood
pressure (DBP) were significantly
decreased and aortic and digital
pulse pressures (PP) were
significantly increased after acute
exercise before ST. Acute resistance
exercise had no effect on HR, wave
reflection (augmentation index and
reflection time), digital, or aortic
systolic BP. ST improved muscle
strength without affecting acute
DBP and PP responses.
The results suggest that a leg-
resistance exercise produces
post-exercise diastolic
hypotension and does not alter
aortic systolic blood pressure
and HR. In addition, vascular

 has favorable results, such as reducing physical and psy-
chological symptoms. However, there are still gaps that
need to be investigated.
Concerning the ST sessions, it was observed that there
is no specific training protocol for patients with FM; thus,
the researchers developed their own protocol. Jones et al.
[45] submitted the patients to a series of four to five repe-
titions, progressively increasing the number of repetitions
up to 12. This protocol was similar to that used by Bircan
et al. [42], who instructed patients to perform a series of
four repetitions and progressively increased the repetitions
by up to 12. Kingsley et al. [28] and Figueroa et al. [49]
also submitted the patients to a series in each exercise;
however, from the beginning of the intervention, the pa-
tients were instructed to perform from 8 to 12 repetitions.
As the first studies analyzed were published in 2001 and
2002, and at that time there was little knowledge about
the development of the disease and the effects of ST on
the patients, those first studies chose to use low load and
series. On the basis of the results of the earlier studies,
more studies were performed and chose to use more
series with more repetitions from the beginning [24, 27,
44, 48]. Despite some differences in the protocols, the in-
tensity of the exercises increased gradually. In some stud-
ies, the intensity reached 80% of 1RM at the end of the
intervention [25, 27]. Another issue concerns weekly

 frequency, but this differed slightly between 2 and 3
weekly sessions. Despite the differences in the protocols, it
was observed that, in general, the studies followed the rec-
ommendations of the American College of Sports Medi-
cine for beginners in ST.
With regard to the main symptoms, there was a
greater interest in pain, strength, quality of life, HRV,
and depression. Pain is the main symptom of FM and is
associated with other symptoms such as depression,
sleep disorders, and poor quality of life [24, 56]; thus,
finding treatments that improve these symptoms are of
crucial clinical relevance for patients. The results of the
present review demonstrate that the pain of patients
with FM is significantly reduced by the ST intervention.
Valkeinen et al. [53] evaluated 23 women with FM, of
whom 13 were submitted to 2 ST sessions for 21 weeks
and 10 were part of the control group. At the end of the
21 weeks of intervention, significant improvement in
pain was observed. Other studies examined the effect of
shorter periods of ST, and found that pain can be
reduced in a short time. Hooten et al. [30] analyzed the
effect of 3-week ST on pain. Participants performed 2
weekly sessions, consisting of a series of 10 repetitions
of knee and elbow flexion and extension exercises. At
the end of the study, a significant reduction of pain was
observed. This result is interesting for health profes-
sionals and for patients with FM, because it demon-
strates that ST can help reduce symptoms in a few
weeks and with few exercises.
Studies indicate that patients with FM have less
strength and reduced functional capacity compared with
healthy persons of the same age and without the disease
[57]. The reduced muscle strength of patients with FM
may be related to pain; because of pain, it is common
for patients to avoid making physical efforts. However,
studies that aimed to verify the responses of patients
with FM after muscular effort showed positive results. In
studies that applied ST, strength and hypertrophy were
similar between patients with and those without the
disease.
Fig. 2 Risk of bias in the studies analyzed
Andrade et al. Advances in Rheumatology           (2018) 58:36 
Page 10 of 14
 The first studies in this sense were those of Hakkinen
et al. [38], Hakkinen et al. [51], Valkeinen et al. [41] and
Valkeinen et al. [52]. The first 2 studies analyzed the ef-
fect of 21-week ST in patients with FM, and compared
the results with those of healthy persons. From the re-
sults of these studies, it can be observed that there was
an increase of force, activation, and hypertrophy in the
ST group and in controls. Hakkinen et al. [51] verified
an increase of 18% in the muscular strength of patients
with FM, and of 22% in the control group, concluding
that the neuromuscular adaptations derived from ST are
similar between patients with FM and healthy persons.
Reinforcing this result, Valkeinen et al. [41] observed a
significant increase of the strength in the extension and
flexion of the knee in patients with FM [33% and 20%,
respectively], whereas in the control group the gains
were 12% and 17%, respectively. Valkeinen et al. [52]
that analyzed strength found that after 21 weeks of ST,
patients with FM had a 36% increase in isometric force
and 33% in concentric force. In addition, the authors
verified a 5% increase in the cross-sectional area of the
thigh and increased activation by 57%. After analyzing
the results, the authors concluded that ST is safe for pa-
tients with FM and that the patients can undergo train-
ing with higher intensities.
Another variable that was investigated in the studies
was the HRV. Some authors suggested that FM occurs be-
cause of dysregulation of the central nervous system [6,
8], causing an autonomic dysfunction that induces the ap-
pearance of some symptoms such as fatigue and anxiety.
Figueroa et al. [49] verified the heart rate behavior of pa-
tients with FM who also had autonomic dysfunction. The
researchers subjected the patients to 16 weeks of ST and
verified improvements in HRV, parasympathetic activity,
and pain reduction. Kingsley et al. [27] compared the ef-
fects of 12 weeks of ST on patients with FM and healthy
women, in terms of various symptoms such as pain, num-
ber of tender points, impact of FM on quality of life, and
HRV. The results showed an increase in strength in both
groups, besides the reduction of pain and tender points in
patients with FM; however, in terms of the behavior of
HRV, no significant difference was observed between pa-
tients with FM and the healthy group. In contrast, in the
study of Kingsley et al. [43] that aimed to verify the auto-
nomic modulation of patients with FM after a ST session,
the results demonstrated that patients with FM had a
lower sympathetic response and greater vagal modulation,
without altering the baroreflex sensitivity, a response dif-
ferent from that presented by the control group. Concern-
ing a possible autonomic dysfunction in patients with FM,
further studies need to be carried out in order to reach a
conclusion.
Other symptoms investigated were quality of life, de-
pression, and sleep disturbance. As quality of life is a
variable that is directly related to other symptoms, the im-
provements observed in the other symptoms suggest that
the quality of life could also be expected to increase. In
the study of Gavi et al. [29], significant improvements in
pain, functionality, quality of life, and depression were
found after 16 weeks of ST. Similar results were found by
Larsson et al. [54] and Palstam et al. [55]. In the first
study, there was a reduction in pain and an increase in
strength and quality of life. In the second study, in
addition to the results seen in previous studies, the re-
searchers noticed a reduction in the fear of performing
exercises. With regard to sleep disturbance, some studies
found a reduction after ST intervention [24, 25]. In
addition, sleep quality correlated with pain, with patients
having less pain experiencing less sleep disorders [24].
With the new possibility of using ST as an alternative
treatment for patients with FM, some researchers began
to compare the effects of ST with those of other physical
exercise interventions. In the study of Bircan et al. [42],
13 women with FM were submitted to aerobic exercise
and 13 were submitted to ST. The researchers found
that both interventions have benefits for patients, in-
cluding reduction of pain, fatigue, sleep disorders, and
depression, and improvement of aerobic capacity. How-
ever, no significant improvements in anxiety were ob-
served in either group. In the studies by Kayo et al. [48]
and Hooten et al. [30], the effects of ST were also com-
pared with those of aerobic exercise. It was noted that
the 2 interventions presented similar results, particularly
in reducing the pain of patients. In addition, other stud-
ies compared ST with relaxation or flexibility exercises.
Assumpção et al. [40] verified the effects of ST and flexi-
bility exercises after 12 weeks of intervention. The re-
sults demonstrated that ST is more effective in reducing
depression, whereas flexibility exercises are better at im-
proving the quality of life, especially physical function
and pain. Gavi et al. [29] found similar results: ST and
flexibility training were effective for reducing symptoms;
however, the best results in terms of pain were found in
the ST group. The study of Jones et al. [45] also com-
pared ST and flexibility training, and verified that both
interventions are effective; however, the most significant
results were found in the ST group. Lorena et al. [58]
performed a systematic review on the effects of stretch-
ing in patients with FM, and reported the importance of
this intervention in improving the physical and mental
aspects of patients. Nevertheless, they emphasized the
need for studies with greater methodological rigor. The
same can be emphasized in the present review: the posi-
tive effect of ST in patients with FM is visible, but it is
necessary to carry out more studies with greater meth-
odological rigor to address possible gaps.
Another interesting result is about adherence to treat-
ments. It is known that patients with FM have difficulties
Andrade et al. Advances in Rheumatology           (2018) 58:36 
Page 11 of 14
 adhering to the practice of physical exercise; however, few
studies reported the adherence of patients to the interven-
tions [59, 60]. In the present review, the mean adherence
percentage was 84%, a result similar to that of the study
by Sanz-Baños et al. [59] in patients undergoing aerobic
exercises [adherence percentage 87.2%]. This result is a
further indication that ST can be used as part of the treat-
ment for patients with FM, because in addition to improv-
ing the symptoms, the patients show high adherence to
the intervention.
Concerning the strengths and limitations of the study,
we were able to verify through a broad literature review
that ST improves the symptoms of patients with FM;
however, some studies presented a high risk of bias and
further studies are needed to consolidate the obtained
results. In addition, future reviews including the gray lit-
erature are warranted in order to identify other studies
on the subject.
Conclusion
In conclusion, ST had positive effects on physical and
psychological symptoms, in terms of reducing pain, the
number of tender points, and depression, and improving
muscle strength, sleep quality, functional capacity, and
quality of life. Intervention protocols should start at low
intensity (40% of 1RM) and gradually increase the inten-
sity. ST should be performed 2 or 3 times a week to ex-
ercise the main muscle groups. The current studies
showed that ST is a safe and effective method of im-
proving the major symptoms of FM and can be used to
treat patients with this condition.
