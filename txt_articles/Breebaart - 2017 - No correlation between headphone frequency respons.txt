Abstract:
This study quantifies variability of measured headphone
response patterns and aims to uncover any correlations between head-
phone type, retail price, and frequency response. For this purpose, the
mean, variance, and covariance of the frequency magnitude responses
were analyzed and correlated with headphone type and retail value. The
results indicate that neither the measured response nor an attempt to
objectively quantify perceived quality is related to price. On average, in-
ear headphones have a slightly higher measured bass response than
circumaural and supra-aural headphones. Furthermore, in-ear and cir-
cumaural headphones have a slightly lower deviation from an assumed
target curve than supra-ear models. Ninety percent of the variance
across all headphone measurements can be described by a set of six
basis functions. The first basis function is similar to published target
responses, while the second basis function represents a spectral tilt.

1. Introduction
The market for headphones and earphones has been growing steadily over the last
decade, both in value and volume. Market reports indicate a world-wide aftermarket
reaching over 11 � 109 units sold per year (Iyer and Jelisejeva, 2016), with growth rates
of up to 55% in the 25–49 USD segment. Research suggests that factors influencing
consumers’ choice as to which model to purchase are mostly based on wireless func-
tionality (Iyer and Jelisejeva, 2016) and attributes such as shape, design, and comfort
(Jensen et al., 2016). Interestingly, sound quality does not seem to be a major attribute
for purchase decisions.
Objective assessments and subjective metrics for sound quality on headphones
have been a subject of research, in particular over the last 5 years. Work by various
authors has indicated that the subjective quality is mostly correlated with linear (spec-
tral) attributes instead of non-linear (distortion) metrics (cf. Temme et al., 2014;
Fleischmann et al., 2014). In particular, research suggests that the frequency (magni-
tude) response is a major factor in listener preference scores (Olive and Welti, 2012;
Fleischmann et al., 2012; Olive et al., 2013), and one headphone can effectively be
transformed into another one by means of headphone equalization (Welti et al., 2016).
The preferred response however seems to be listener, content, and headphone depen-
dent (Olive and Welti, 2015; Olive et al., 2016). Nevertheless, if one aims for a one-
fits-all target response, diffuse field or free-field responses seem to be less preferred
than a response based on measurements of a calibrated loudspeaker system in a listen-
ing room (Fleischmann et al., 2012; Olive et al., 2013).
The body of research work covering headphone responses and target curves is
typically based on a relatively small set of headphones. Therefore, variance patterns of
headphone responses and their dependencies on headphone type and retail price are
difficult to uncover. The aim of this paper is to reveal such patterns across a large set
of headphones and to investigate whether and how these response patterns vary with
price and headphone type.
2. Method
Headphone spectral magnitude responses were measured on a HMS II.3 artificial head
(HEAD Acoustics, Germany) equipped with a type 3.3, open ear canal artificial ear
(ITU-T P.380 2003). Each headphone was reseated at least five times. A 5.46-s log sine
sweep covering a frequency range between 20 Hz and 20 kHz was converted to

 electrical signals by a Fireface UC (RME, Germany) sound card using the headphone
output connector. Log sine sweeps rather than linear sine sweeps were employed to
allow verification that non-linear distortion components were virtually absent. The
responses for both the left and right channel were measured with a sampling rate of
48 kHz. The 10þ measurements were averaged in the spectral power density domain
using a discrete Fourier transform. Subsequently, the averaged response was converted
to the log domain, and resampled to a perceptually-relevant frequency distribution
between 20 Hz and 19 kHz with 0.1 equivalent rectangular bandwidth resolution [cf.
Glasberg and Moore (1990)] using linear interpolation. After interpolation, the mean
response across frequency was subtracted. In total, measurements for 283 headphones
[in-ear (IE), supra-aural (SA), and circumaural (CA)] were acquired. Headphone retail
prices were determined using Google shopping in Australia and converted to USD
using a fixed exchange rate of 0.75. All headphones were categorized according to
retail price quantile (with cutoffs of 25% and 75%) and headphone type (CA, SA,
and IE).
3. Results
3.1 Mean and variance
The mean and variance of the headphone response curves as a function of frequency
are shown in Fig. 1. The solid black line within the gray area represents the arithmetic
mean, and the gray area denotes the standard deviation. The top panels group the
data into quantiles according to retail price; the bottom panels represent CA, IE, and
SA headphones, for the left, middle, and right panel, respectively. The variable N in
the panel titles presents the number of headphones in each category. The text inset in
each panel denotes the root-mean-square deviation (RMSD) for each category across
all frequencies, and for frequencies below 100 Hz only.
Across all groups, the averaged responses demonstrate a resonant peak at
around 3.5 kHz, a secondary resonance at 10 kHz, and a general decrease in response
toward 19 kHz. The average response does not seem to differ much across categories,
with the exception of the IE headphones demonstrating an amplified low-frequency
response and a wider resonance around 2–5 kHz (bottom-middle panel of Fig. 1). The
higher low-frequency magnitude response for IE headphones could be resulting from
an acoustic seal between an insert headset and an artificial ear greater than that typi-
cally occurring for humans. In other words, listeners may not necessarily perceive IE
headphones as on average having a greater bass response.

 The variance and the wide-band deviation across headphones (RMSD)
decrease slightly with increasing price (RMSD of 4.3 and 3.5 dB for the lower and
upper 25% quantile, respectively). The largest decrease in variance with price is
observed for frequencies below 100 Hz, with the highest 25% price quantile having less
than half the RMSD of the lowest 25% price quantile.
3.2 PCA
A principal component analysis (PCA) was performed across the headphone responses
to investigate how response patterns correlate across frequency. The first six eigenvec-
tors are shown in the left panel of Fig. 2, along with the cumulative percentage of vari-
ance accounted for. The right panels show the corresponding eigenvalue vs price for
each headphone. Different symbols represent different headphone types (see the legend
for Fig. 2).
The first eigenvector is identical to the mean response across headphones. The
corresponding eigenvalues are all positive while their magnitude deviates considerably
across headphones. The second eigenvector seems to reflect an overall spectral tilt,
with eigenvalues roughly centered around zero. The third to sixth eigenvectors seem to
mostly model the position and magnitude of high-frequency peaks and notches. The
corresponding eigenvalues are scattered around zero. Most interestingly, none of the
eigenvalues seem to correlate strongly with the retail price, nor does there seem to exist
any clear dependencies on headphone type. The results also indicate that 90% of the
headphone response variance can be accounted for by six eigenvectors. This result sup-
ports the notion that headphone equalization may be realized by means of a small set
of basis functions (Fleischmann et al., 2013).
3.3 Deviation from a target curve
Root-mean square errors (RMSEs) were calculated across frequency for each head-
phone with respect to an assumed target curve to assess an objective quality metric.
Two target curves were used: the overall mean curve across all measured headphones,
and the target curve suggested by Olive and Welti (2015). The two target curves are
shown in the top panel of Fig. 3; the curve from Olive and Welti (2015) was lowered
by 6.5 dB to facilitate easier comparison between the two. When comparing the two

to six, respectively. Different symbols represent different headphone types (SA, IE, CA).

 target curves, the largest difference between the two seems to exist between 50 Hz and
2 kHz, for which the average headphone response is up to 5 dB higher than the target
curve suggested by Olive and Welti (2015), in particular around 100–200 Hz. The scat-
ter plots of RMSE against retail price (lower panels of Fig. 3) are nevertheless very
similar in the sense that none of them demonstrates a high correlation between price
and deviation from the target curve. The numerical value between brackets in the inset
of the lower panels denotes the Pearson correlation coefficient between RMSE and
price. The IE headphones demonstrate the largest (absolute) correlation but its magni-
tude is nevertheless very small.
To further establish the significance of headphone type and RMSE, a two-way
analysis of variance (ANOVA) was conducted with headphone type and RMSE as
independent factors, and price as a dependent variable. These tests were based on a
single target curve for all three headphone types (Olive and Welti, 2015). The effect of
headphone type was shown to be significant [ANOVA F statistic F(279, 2) ¼ 21.05; sig-
nificance level or probability of falsely rejecting the Null hypothesis p < 0.0001] while
the effect of RMSE was not [F(279, 1) ¼ 2.59; p > 0.10]. A post hoc comparison of
mean RMSEs across headphone types was performed using a non-parametric permuta-
tion test and the median as location statistic. Bonferroni-adjusted p values indicated
that the RMSEs for CA and IE headphones are on average significantly smaller than
those for SA headphones (p < 0.025).
4. Conclusions
• Based on the evaluation of the mean, variance, PCA, and mean square error with
respect to a target function, no correlation could be observed between the measured
magnitude response and retail price of headphones. However, the variance in low-
frequency response seems to decrease with increasing price, indicating an improved
bass response measurement consistency across headphones in the higher price range. It
is however unclear whether this improved consistency with a higher retail price is the

phone type.

 result of better headphones or better repeatability of measurements with more expen-
sive models. Nevertheless, assuming that the perceived audio quality is largely deter-
mined by the spectral magnitude response of headphones, there are plenty of relatively
cheap models that match the assumed target function, as well as very expensive ones
that deviate significantly from an assumed ideal response.
• On average, IE headphone measurements demonstrate slightly more bass than CA and
SA headphones. The difference amounts to approximately 4 dB at 100 Hz. This finding
is in line with subjective preference ratings reported by Olive et al. (2016). The
observed higher bass response could be resulting from a greater seal between head-
phones and artificial ear compared to the seal for human ears (ITU-T P.380, 2003).
• CA and IE headphones have a response that (on average) more closely mimics the tar-
get curve proposed by Olive and Welti (2015) than SA headphones.
• The target function suggested by Olive and Welti (2015) is fairly similar to the average
headphone response found in this study, with the exception of a deviation of up to
about 5 dB for frequencies between 50 Hz and 2 kHz.
• PCA can account for 90% of the variance across all measured headphones with six
eigenvectors. The first eigenvector is similar to published target responses, while the
second eigenvector represents a global spectral tilt.
5. Limitations
First, all analyses were based on magnitude responses only, discarding phase or non-
linear attributes. Research has suggested that non-linear properties of headphone
responses have little effect and no significant traces of non-linear behavior were
observed in this study. However the author is not aware of any work on the perceptual
implications of the phase response of headphones. A second limitation is that a specific
target curve was assumed, irrespective of the headphone type, audio content, listener
demographics, or influence of environmental sounds. Third, it is well known that
dummy-head measurements for headphones can be inaccurate at low and high frequen-
cies and deviate from human ear canal measurements (ITU-T P.380, 2003; Christensen
et al., 2013). Repeated measurements for reseated headphones should partly alleviate
this problem. However, it could be that measurement inaccuracies have some implica-
tions for the results and conclusions drawn in this paper.
