Abstract
Background Strength training set organisation and its
relationship to the development of muscular strength have
yet to be clearly defined. Current meta-analytical research
suggests that different population groups have distinctive
muscular adaptations, primarily due to the prescription of
the strength training set dose.
Objectives We conducted a meta-analysis with restrictive
inclusion criteria and examined the potential effects of low
(LWS), medium (MWS) or high weekly set (HWS)
strength training on muscular strength per exercise. Sec-
ondly, we examined strength gain variations when per-
forming multi-joint or isolation exercises, and probed for a
potential relationship between weekly set number and stage
of subjects’ training (trained versus untrained).
Methods Computerised
searches
were
performed
on
PubMed,
MEDLINE,
SWETSWISE,
EMBASE
and
SPORTDiscusTM using the terms ‘strength training’, ‘re-
sistance training’, ‘single sets’, ‘multiple sets’ and ‘vol-
ume’. As of September 2016, 6962 potentially relevant
studies were identified. After review, nine studies were
deemed eligible per pre-set inclusion criteria. Primary data
were pooled using a random-effect model. Outcomes for
strength gain, strength gain with multi-joint and isolation
exercise were analysed for main effects. Sensitivity anal-
yses were calculated for several subgroups by separating
the data set and by calculation of separate analyses for each
subgroup. Heterogeneity between studies was assessed
using the Cochran Q and I2 statistics.
Results Pre- versus post-training strength analysis com-
prised 61 treatment groups from nine studies. For com-
bined multi-joint and isolation exercises, pre- versus post-
training strength gains were greater with HWS compared
with

(95% CI 0.47–1.17). The mean ES for HWS was 1.01
(95% CI 0.70–1.32). Separate analysis of the effects of
pre- versus post-training strength for LWS or MWS
observed marginally greater strength gains with MWS
compared with LWS (ES 0.15; 95% CI 0.01–0.30;
p = 0.04). The mean ES for LWS was 0.83 (95% CI
0.53–1.13). The mean ES for MWS was 0.98 (95% CI
0.62–1.34). For multi-joint exercises, greater strength
gains were observed with HWS compared with LWS (ES
0.18; 95% CI 0.01–0.34; p = 0.04). The mean ES for
LWS was 0.81 (95% CI 0.65–0.97). The mean ES for
HWS was 1.00 (95% CI 0.77–1.23). For isolation exer-
cises, greater strength gains were observed with HWS
compared with LWS (ES 0.23; 95% CI 0.06–0.40;
p = 0.008). The mean ES for LWS was 0.95 (95% CI
0.30–1.60). The mean ES for HWS was 1.10 (95% CI
0.26–1.94). For multi-joint and isolation exercise-specific
one repetition maximum (1 RM), marginally greater
strength gains were observed with HWS compared with
LWS (ES 0.14; 95% CI -0.01 to 0.29; p = 0.06). The
mean ES for LWS was 0.80 (95% CI 0.47–1.13). The
mean ES for HWS was 0.97 (95% CI 0.68–1.26).

 Conclusion This meta-analysis presents additional evi-
dence regarding a graded dose–response relationship
between weekly sets performed and strength gain. The use
of MWS and HWS was more effective than LWS, with
LWS producing the smallest pre- to post-training strength
difference. For novice and intermediate male trainees, the
findings suggest that LWSs do not lead to strength gains
compared with MWS or HWS training. For those trainees
in the middle ground, not a novice and not advanced, the
existing data provide a relationship between weekly sets
and strength gain as set configurations produced different
pre- to post-training strength increases. For well trained
individuals, the use of either MWS or HWS may be an
appropriate dose to produce strength gains.
Key Points
Medium (MWS) or high weekly set (HWS) strength
training is marginally more effective in producing
strength gains than low weekly set (LWS) strength
training.
The use of either MWS or HWS training may be an
appropriate dose to produce strength gains for well
trained males.
For male trainees at novice and intermediate level,
MWS training is more effective than LWS training
for both multi-joint and isolation exercises.
For those trainees in the middle ground (not a novice
or advanced), the existing data provide evidence of a
pre- to post-graded set dose–response relationship in
strength for both multi-joint and isolation exercises.
1 Introduction
1.1 Rationale
Strength training is the most popular form of exercise for
developing musculoskeletal strength [1]. The physiological
adaptations of a strength training programme can result in
increased strength, muscular hypertrophy, connective tis-
sue thickness, increased fat-free mass and improved motor
functioning [2]. Over the last decade, studies have
demonstrated greater strength gains with multiple sets
(MS) per exercise [3–5] than when performing one set.
This has been reinforced by several meta-analyses that
advocate the use of MS to promote greater strength gains in
both trained and untrained subjects [6–9].
The meta-analysis by Rhea et al. [6] reported significant
magnitude in strength gains between trained and untrained
groups. The effective size (ES) for both men and women,
regardless of training status, were similar and the dose–
response curves comparable for all age ranges. Rhea and
colleagues’ meta-analysis [6] reported a significant differ-
ence between one and three sets (ES = 2.3 bench press and
ES = 6.5 leg press, respectively). The one-set bench press
pre-to-post had a reported strength increase of 20% com-
pared with the three-set bench press that resulted in a
strength increase of 33%. The pre- to post-leg press
strength resulted in a strength increase of 25.4% for one set
compared with a strength increase of 52.1% with three sets.
The pre- to post-leg press strength difference was more
than eight times greater than a large ES (6.5), which pre-
sents an extraordinary result in the scientific literature that
has not been reproduced.
The meta-analysis by Peterson et al. [9] concluded that
competitive athletes should perform eight sets per muscle
group to increase muscular strength; however, limited
evidence supported this within the review. The conclusions
were inconsistent due to the small number of ESs in the
eight-set group, creating unpredictable patterns of evidence
when analysing specific one repetition maximum training
percentages (% 1RM). The ES for training at 70% 1RM
indicated no impact upon subject’s strength. When the
percentage 1RM loads were increased to 75% 1RM and
85% 1RM, a large ES was reported but also a very large
standard deviation. No physiological mechanism or theory
can validate why a variation of 5% 1RM can result in such
large strength differences. Peterson et al. [9] provided
limited descriptions concerning the volume intensity and
only included the mean ES that demonstrated maximal
strength gains. No data supporting loading or strength
differences in kilograms were provided to allow informed
decisions on the evidence to be made.
Wolfe et al. [7] meta-analysis reported that resistance
training (RT) programmes that lasted between 17 and
40 weeks did not generate significantly higher ESs in
comparison with those between 6 and 15 weeks. This
suggests that training progression is linear and there was no
reported difference between 6–15 and 17–40 weeks in
strength gain. The data indicated that trained individuals
performing multiple sets generated greater increases in
strength (p B 0.001) and that a single-set programme may
be
used
for
untrained
individuals
after
the
initial
6–15 weeks. The untrained individuals were reported to
have similar gains in strength as that of trained individuals
when performing multiple sets. The difference in mean
value for the set number was statistically significant when
allowing for the effects of changes in programme duration
(p B 0.005). Specifically, multiple-set programmes pro-
duced larger increases in strength compared with single
2586

123
 sets (p B 0.002) when RT exercises were performed to
subjects’ physical failure versus subjects’ own perceived
end. The main conclusion of the Wolfe et al. [7] analysis
was no significant differences for the subjects’ physical
failure versus subjects’ own perceived end and the number
of sets performed (p B 0.052) when trained and untrained
subjects were separated by training status.
Krieger [8] compared the effects of single versus mul-
tiple sets of exercises on strength, using a hierarchical
random effects linear mixed model meta-regression. The
analysis consisted of 14 studies (440 participants), with 30
treatment groups and a total of 92 ESs. The results indi-
cated that multiple sets were associated with a larger ES
than one set. When the dose–response model was further
analysed, there was a drift towards two to three sets per
exercise compared with one set. No significant difference
was reported between one set per exercise and four to six
sets per exercise or between two to three sets per exercise
and four to six sets per exercise. Krieger [8] concluded that
two to three sets per resistance exercise was associated
with 46% greater strength gains than one set in both trained
and untrained subjects.
Garber et al. [10] constructed the American College of
Sports Medicine (ACSM) position stand that provides
guidance on the individual prescription of exercise to
apparently healthy adults of all ages. In that position stand,
Garber et al. [10] cited four meta-analytical studies that
contain contradicting recommendations [6–9]. Otto and
Carpinelli [11] questioned the validity of the Rhea et al. [6]
meta-analysis due to the inclusion of the Rhea et al. [12]
study. The Rhea et al. [12] study had a post-training bench
press ES three to four times superior to the pre-training
measurement in one and three sets with no confidence
intervals included with the ESs. Another Rhea et al. [13]
meta-analysis of 140 studies with a total of 1433 ESs was
conducted to identify any dose–response relationship. The
ESs demonstrated different responses based on training
status of the trainees. Untrained individuals experienced
maximal strength gains by training each muscle group
3 days�week-1 with four sets per muscle group. Trained
individuals should train at a frequency of 2 days�week-1
with four sets per muscle group. The analysis of Rhea et al.
[13] supports the theory of progression in RT for strength
development. Carpinelli [14], however, has questioned the
meta-analytical evidence and the methods used to select the
studies, extract the data and assess study validity, which
were not clearly described.
The existing consensus regarding the association of sets
of exercises completed and strength development remains
controversial. This is due to the lack of a controlled and
quantified relationship between strength training variables
presented in the primary research literature. The inclusion
of low-quality studies within a meta-analysis can introduce
spurious conclusions regarding strength outcomes, as
variations in the exercises included in studies, variation in
subject characteristics, and variance in experimental pro-
gramme design may affect reliability and accuracy. As a
consequence of previous imprecision and poor experi-
mental control, conclusions with respect to set number and
strength gain are likely not reflective of the specific adap-
tations resulting from imposed physiological stress.
1.2 Objectives
Although meta-analyses regarding the effects of set volume
on strength have been published [6–9], none limited their
analyses to measures of strength by weekly set volume
with restricted subject pools adequately. The purpose of
this paper was to conduct a meta-analysis on the effects of
low (LWS), medium (MWS) or high weekly set (HWS)
strength training on male muscular strength per exercise. A
secondary purpose was to establish if multi-joint exercises
produce a different strength gain profile when compared
with single joint exercises by specific weekly set training.
A third purpose was to provide a perspective on developing
muscular strength across stages of training progression in
male trainees. Based on previous meta-analytic data [8], we
hypothesised that there would be a pre- to post-training
graded dose–response relationship in strength, with higher
weekly set training promoting superior strength results.
2 Methods
2.1 Eligibility Criteria
Included studies were selected and initially coded accord-
ing to the following criteria: (a) RT programme lasting a
minimum of 4 weeks; (b) training at least one major
muscle group—quadriceps (vastus medialis, vastus inter-
medius, vastus lateralis, rectus femoris), hamstrings (bicep
femoris, semitendinosus, semimembranosus), pectoralis
major, latissimus dorsi, deltoids (anterior, lateral, poste-
rior), biceps or triceps; (c) adult male subjects aged
18–60 years; (d) compared single versus multiple sets per
exercise; (e) all subjects free from muscular skeletal, or
orthopaedic injuries, or physical limitations; (f) pre- to
post-1 RM measurement of muscular strength; (g) subject’s
descriptive
characteristics included in
report (height,
weight, training status and training experience); (h) suffi-
cient data to determine sets and intensity of exercise and to
calculate ESs. Randomised controlled trials (RCTs) and
randomly assigned trials (RANs) that observed the inter-
vention programmes using stratified single- versus multi-
ple-set dosages were used for this analysis. RCTs represent
a more rigorous method for determining a cause–effect

 relationship between treatment and outcome. RAN allo-
cation ensures no systematic differences between inter-
vention groups; however, no control group is included
within this research design that may impact upon the
assessment of outcomes.
2.2 Information Sources
Computerised searches were performed to generate citation
lists from the following databases: PubMed, MEDLINE,
SWETSWISE, EMBASE, SPORTDiscusTM. The period of
search history examined was comprehensive to September
2016. Additional relevant studies were identified by hand
searching and cross-referencing of key journals, reference
lists and other sources. Relevant descriptive terms used to
retrieve studies in English were ‘strength training’, ‘resis-
tance training’, ‘single sets’, ‘multiple sets’ and ‘volume’.
Boolean operators, including AND, OR and NOT, were
used to focus literature searches.
2.3 Study Selection
The literature searches were limited to training studies
involving humans. This resulted in retrieval of papers
published from 1987 through to September 2016 in which
single-set versus multiple-set interventions were compared,
in both untrained and trained subjects. Abstracts and cita-
tions from scientific conferences and studies published in
foreign language journals were excluded.
2.4 Data Collection Process
All calculations were conducted using a Microsoft Excel
(Microsoft, Redmond, WA, USA) spreadsheet containing
data extracted from each publication. In addition, Review
Manager (RevMan) version 5.3.5 was used for all statistical
analyses and forest plots. Cochran Q statistic [15] was used
to assess heterogeneity between studies. Heterogeneity
refers to the existence of variation between studies on the
main effects being evaluated. This is an appropriate test for
larger meta-analyses and uses the sum of squared devia-
tions of the specific estimates derived from the pooled
estimate and weights the contribution of each study. The
p values were achieved by comparing the Q statistic with a
V2 distribution with k-1 degrees of freedom, where k rep-
resents the number of included studies. In addition, the I2
statistic
was
used
to
assess
heterogeneity,
with
an
I2 [ 50% used to indicate heterogeneity. RT programme
effects for muscular strength were calculated for each
included study following coding of pre-to-post changes and
standard deviations (SDs). The mean difference (MD) or
change in post-intervention mean was calculated by sub-
tracting the baseline from post-intervention values for all
strength outcome measures. Change in the SD of post-in-
tervention outcomes was calculated using RevMan (version
5.3.5). Data were required to be either (1) mean and SDs
(pre- and post-intervention), (2) 95% confidence interval
(CI) data for pre- to post-intervention change for each
group, or when this was unavailable, (3) actual p values for
pre- to post-intervention change for each group, or if only
the level of statistical significance was available, (4)
default
p
values
(e.g.
p B 0.05
becomes
p B 0.49,
p B 0.01 becomes p B 0.0099 and p B not significant
becomes p B 0.05). A random-effects inverse variance
(IV) was used with the effects measure of MD.
The analysis of ES was conducted with a random-effects
model estimated using the DerSimonian and Laird method
[16]. A random-effects model is incorporated when the
assumption is that the effect across studies is randomly
situated about a central value.
For each of the two measures, forest plots were gener-
ated to demonstrate the study-specific pre- to post-training
strength differences and ESs, within the respective 95%
CIs. Combining estimates then allowed for assessment of a
pooled effect, in which the reciprocal of the sum of two
variances was accounted for, including (1) the estimated
variance associated with the study and (2) the estimated
component of variance due to the variation between stud-
ies. Visual inspection of forest plots for each performance
measure against its standard error was included to account
for the ‘file drawer problem’, the potential effect of pub-
lished studies being intrinsically biased due to a greater
probability of significant results.
Separate meta-regressions on ESs were performed with
the following moderator variables: total sets per RT exer-
cise per week as a continuous variable; total sets per multi-
joint exercise per week categorised as LWS (B5), MWS
(5–9) or HWS (C10); total sets per isolation exercise per
week categorised as LWS (B5), MWS (5–9) or HWS
(C10). In the regression model, mean differences in ES
were calculated for each study to give a study-level ES for
the difference between LWS, MWS and HWS to allow for
the generation of forest plots. A sensitivity analysis was
conducted to identify the presence of highly influential
studies which might bias the analysis. This was performed
for each model by removing one study at a time and then
examining the weekly set volume predictor. Influential
studies were identified and removed if they resulted in a
change
from
significant
(p B 0.10)
to
nonsignificant
(p C 0.10), or vice versa, or if removal caused a large
change in the magnitude of the coefficient.
Articles deemed to meet inclusion criteria were obtained
and examined by the primary reviewer. In the case of
inadequate information from selected manuscripts, the
secondary reviewer confirmed satisfaction or non-satis-
faction of inclusion criteria. In each study, the ES for the
2588

123
 intervention was calculated as the difference between the
means of the pre-test and post-test at the end of the RT
intervention. The study-specific weight was derived as the
inverse of the square of the respective standard errors. The
ESs of B0.2, B0.5, B0.8 and C0.8 were considered trivial,
small, moderate and large, respectively [17].
3 Results
The flow of article search and selection is depicted in
Fig. 1, from ‘potentially relevant’ to final article inclusion.
3.1 Study Selection
The preliminary search yielded 6962 relevant abstracts and
citations. The full text of 86 articles was deemed to meet
inclusion criteria (Table 1). A total of nine studies with 223
subjects were deemed eligible per the inclusion criteria
[13, 18–25]. Articles included in the analysis had publi-
cation dates ranging from 1987 to 2016. The experimental
design of included studies had a random assignment of
treatment conditions (RAN) and randomised control groups
(RCT). The training status of subjects included in the nine
studies was trained (n = 4) and untrained (n = 5) males
(Table 2).
3.2 Study Characteristics
In total, nine studies provided data on 223 male subjects
(Table 2). The mean age of the subjects was 23.4 years
(±2.18 years). The length of training ranged from 8 to
26 weeks (mean 11.11 ± 5.7 weeks), frequency ranged
from two to four times per week (mean 2.8 ± 0.32 per
week) and the exercise intensity ranged from 73.5 to 85%
of the 1RM (mean 78.2 ± 4.1% 1RM). The number of sets
reported ranged from one to 12 sets (mean 3.14 ± 2.63
sets). The within-group number of repetitions performed
ranged from three to 18 (mean 8.8 ± 1.6 repetitions).
3.3 Sensitivity Analysis
To investigate for study heterogeneity, Galbraith plots were
used to identify any potential outliers (Fig. 2). Examination
Galbraith plots revealed that Reid [24] elbow extension and
shoulder flexion data were influential (Fig. 3). Removal of
Reid [24] data reduced the impact of the weekly number of
sets on strength gain (Table 3). Trim and fill funnel plots
and Egger’s tests were performed to assess for publication
bias of literature in all comparison models. The shape of
the funnel plot did not reveal any evidence of obvious
asymmetry
(Fig. 4).
Results
from
an
Egger’s
test
(p = 0.393) confirmed no evidence of publication bias.
3.4 Effect of Weekly Set Volume on Multi-Joint
and Isolation Resistance Exercise
Pre- to post-intervention strength differences were assessed
via meta-analysis for all included studies, then multi-joint
exercises were combined into a sub-group analysis and
isolation exercises were combined into a separate sub-
group analysis. Due to potential heterogeneity, a random
effects model was incorporated with I2 used to assess each
strength measure.
3.4.1 Effects of Weekly Set Volume on Combined Multi-
Joint and Isolation Exercise
Outcomes for weekly sets categorised as LWS or HWS
(MWS and HWS combined) are shown in the forest plot
in Fig. 5. The forest plot contains the mean ESs and
corresponding CIs for strength gain separated for inter-
ventions featuring LWS and HWS as well as the overall
effect test and heterogeneity analysis. The pooled mean
ES estimates of multi-joint and isolation data (Table 3)
comprised
61
treatment
groups
from
nine
studies
[13, 18–25]. There was moderate heterogeneity detected
in
the
nine
studies
included
in
the
meta-analysis
(I2 = 45%). When a random effects analysis was applied,
a trivial effect was observed for multi-joint and isolation
weekly set outcomes (ES 0.18; 95% CI 0.06–0.30;
p = 0.003). Pre- to post-intervention strength gain was
greater with HWS compared with LWS (ES difference
0.19). The mean ES for LWS was 0.82 (95% CI
0.47–1.17). The mean ES for HWS was 1.01 (95% CI
0.70–1.32).
Outcomes for weekly sets categorised as LWS or MWS
within each study are shown in Fig. 6. There was signifi-
cant
heterogeneity
detected
in
the
seven
studies
(I2 = 74%). When a random-effects analysis was applied,
a trivial effect was observed (ES 0.15; 95% CI 0.01–0.30;
p = 0.04). Pre- to post-intervention strength gain was
marginally greater with MWS compared with LWS (ES
difference = 0.15). The mean ES for LWS was 0.83 (95%
CI 0.53–1.13). The mean ES for MWS was 0.98 (95% CI
0.62–1.34). Examination of MWS versus HWS pre-to post-
intervention strength differences was not feasible due to
limited study data.
3.4.2 Effect of Weekly Set Volume on Multi-Joint Exercise
Outcomes for weekly sets categorised as LWS or HWS
(MWS and HWS combined) for multi-joint exercises are
shown in the forest plot in Fig. 7. The pooled mean ES
estimates of multi-joint-only exercise strength data com-
prised 33 treatment groups from six studies [13, 18–22].
There was significant heterogeneity detected in the six

 studies included in the meta-analysis of multi-joint-only
weekly set outcomes (I2 = 86%). When a random effects
analysis was applied, a trivial effect was observed (ES
0.18; 95% CI 0.01–0.34; p = 0.04). Pre- to post-interven-
tion strength gain was greater with HWS compared with
LWS (ES difference 0.19). The mean ES for LWS was 0.81
(95% CI 0.65–0.97). The mean ES for HWS was 1.00 (95%
CI 0.77–1.23). Examination of MWS versus HWS pre- to
post-intervention strength differences was not feasible due
to limited study data.
3.4.3 Effect of Weekly Set Volume on Isolation Exercise
Outcomes for weekly sets categorised as LWS or MWS for
isolation exercises are shown in the forest plot in Fig. 8.
The pooled mean ES estimate of combined isolation
exercises (Table 4) comprised 28 treatment groups from
five studies [19, 21, 23–25]. There was no heterogeneity
detected in the five studies included in the meta-analysis of
isolation-only weekly set outcomes (I2 = 0%). When a
random effects analysis was applied, a small effect was

 observed (ES 0.23; 95% CI 0.06–0.40; p = 0.008). Pre- to
post-intervention strength gain was greater with HWS
compared with LWS (ES difference 0.15). The mean ES
for LWS was 0.95 (95% CI 0.30–1.60). The mean ES for
HWS was 1.10 (95% CI 0.26–1.94). Examination of HWS
pre- to post-intervention strength differences was not fea-
sible due to limited study data.
3.5 Effects of Weekly Set Volume on Exercise-
Specific 1RM
Outcomes for weekly sets categorised as LWS or HWS
(MWS and HWS combined) for multi-joint and isolation
exercise-specific 1RM by study are shown in the forest plot
in Fig. 9. The pooled mean ES estimates of multi-joint and
isolation strength data comprised 55 treatment groups from
nine studies [13, 18–25]. There was moderate heterogeneity
detected in the nine studies included in the meta-analysis of
multi-joint and isolation weekly set outcomes (I2 = 70%).
When a random effects analysis was applied, a trivial effect
was observed (ES 0.14; 95% CI -0.01 to 0.29; p = 0.06).
Pre- to post-intervention strength gain was greater with HWS
compared with LWS (ES difference 0.17). The mean ES for
LWS was 0.80 (95% CI 0.47–1.13). The mean ES for HWS
was 0.97 (95% CI 0.68–1.26). Examination of MWS versus
HWS pre- to post-intervention strength differences was not
feasible due to limited study data.
4 Discussion
The purpose of this meta-analysis was threefold: (1) to
investigate the effects of LWS, MWS or HWS of strength
training
on
muscular
strength
per
exercise;
(2)
to
investigate if the magnitude of strength gain differs
between multi-joint and isolation exercises; and (3) to
provide a perspective on developing muscular strength
across stages of training progression.
For novice and intermediate male trainees, the findings
suggest that MWS and HWS strength training may lead to
larger strength gains than LWS. For more experienced
individuals, such as advanced and elite trainees, the sparse
data available suggest that MWS and HWS strength
training may create greater strength gains compared with
LWS. The findings suggest that MWS and HWS strength
training may produce marginally greater strength gains
compared with LWS in certain contexts. LWS strength
training per exercise appears to be less effective in both
multi-joint and isolation exercises compared with MWS
and HWS strength training.
The available data for exercise-specific 1RM provide
support for the conventional view of a graded dose–response
relationship where strength gains increase as a function of
increased number of sets included in training. Examination
of the effects of weekly set volume on exercise-specific 1RM
support a graded dose–response relationship. The pooled
mean ES estimate for LWS was 0.80 (95% CI 0.47–1.13)
compared with HWS (0.97; 95% CI 0.68–1.26). The mean
ES for LWS multi-joint-only exercises pre- to post-inter-
vention was 0.81 (95% CI 0.65–0.97) compared with HWS
(1.00; 95% CI 0.77–1.23). When LWS training was used as
the control group and the HWS group was used as the
experimental programme, a trivial ES of 0.18 (95% CI 0.01–
0.34; p = 0.04) suggested that HWS training was more
effective in producing strength gains. When LWS training
was used as the control group and MWS training used as the
experimental group, a trivial ES of 0.15 (95% CI 0.01–0.30;
p = 0.04) suggested that MWS training is marginally more

 relationship in strength gains. The data would thus suggest
that MWS and HWS strength training produce marginally
superior results compared with LWS.
The mean ES for isolation exercises on pre- to post-
intervention strength gains in males was 0.95 (95% CI
0.30–1.60) for LWS compared with 1.10 (95% CI
0.26–1.94) for the HWS training programme. When LWS
training was used as the control group and HWS training
used as the experimental programme, a small ES of 0.23
(95% CI 0.06–0.40; p = 0.008) suggested that HWS
training is more effective in producing strength gains for
isolation exercises. The data for isolation exercises support
the conventional belief in a graded dose–response pattern
for an increased number of exercise sets and strength gain.
Examination of the effects of weekly set volume on iso-
lation exercise-specific 1RM was not feasible due to very
small sample sizes that would lead to an over-parame-
terised model being performed on isolation exercises.
Examination of the effect of stage of training (beginner
through elite) on strength gain was problematic as no
available well controlled studies tested such a relationship.
The limited available data suggested that comparable
strength gains may be produced in earlier stages of training
by multi-joint exercises when either MWS or HWS are
employed. For advanced and elite trainees, the employ-
ment of either MWS or HWS may be considered as there
was a small increase in strength in comparison with LWS
training. The MWS and HWS pre- to post-strength pro-
gramme produced marginally greater ESs compared with
LWS training for the multi-joint and isolation combined
exercise (ES 0.98, 1.01 vs 0.82, respectively). When LWS
training was used as a control group and the HWS as the
experimental programme, a trivial ES of 0.18 (95% CI
0.06–0.30; p = 0.003) was observed that suggested HWS
training is more effective in producing strength gains.

 4.1 Current Meta-Analysis-Based
Recommendations for Strength Development
The existing dogma on the number of sets best driving
strength development has been largely indefinable and
contentious. Set volume in RT has historically been an
often-debated issue, based on varying recommendations
favouring multiple-set programming with evidence cited
from published meta-analyses [6–9]. However, these pre-
vious meta-analyses conducted on muscular strength gain
reported inconsistent and varied outcomes. Of the four
meta-analyses conducted [6–9] on this subject, none pro-
vided a clear and consistent trail of evidence identifying a
dose–response relationship for maximum strength gains,
upon which a determination of the best set scheme can be
made. The inconclusiveness of previous research and pre-
vious meta-analyses have not altered the general preference
in the programming of multiple sets over single-set training
to create strength gains for every stage of training pro-
gression, beginner to elite.
Three of the four meta-analyses that are included within
the ACSM [26] recommendations [6–8] have method-
ological constraints and the published evidence provided is
disputed [11, 14]. Rhea et al. [6], in their meta-analysis,
reported that significant differences emerged between the
trained and the untrained groups. Rhea et al. [6] reported
that
80%
of
1RM
with
a
training
frequency
of
2 days�week-1 and four sets per muscle group elicited
superior gains in strength. In their consideration of
untrained populations, they recommended RT loading at
60% of 1RM for 3 days�week-1 and employing four sets
per exercise. Otto and Carpinelli [11] questioned the
inclusion of studies in the Rhea et al. [6] meta-analysis and
identified several confounding factors and inaccuracies that

 may have influenced the reliability of the meta-analysis.
These included the reporting of incorrect ESs for advanced
trainees, including claims that training at 80% 1RM
resulted in an ES (1.8) that was three times greater than
using 85% 1RM (ES 0.65). Furthermore, they reported that
training each muscle group twice per week had an ES of
1.4 which was two times greater than training three times a
week (ES 0.70). The inclusion of the Rhea et al. [13] study
may have introduced error or bias as it reported an ES of
2.3 between groups in the bench press and an ES of 6.5 in
the leg press when comparing the means of the one-set and
three-set groups. The post-training standard deviation
bench press results were two to three times superior to the
pre-training standard deviation in both groups and the
researchers did not provide confidence intervals for ES.
This ES is almost three times larger than what is designated
as statistically large (C0.8) [27]. In addition, the leg press
ES of 6.5 is more than eight times greater than a large ES,
which presents an extraordinary ES that is not seen in any
other related papers in the scientific literature [28]. As
such, the inclusion of the Rhea et al. [13] leg press data in a
meta-analysis could nullify the mean ES and spuriously
affect the findings by increasing the heterogeneity of the
meta-analysis
and
erroneously
favouring
multiple-set
programming.
In the Peterson et al. [9] meta-analysis the authors propose
that as strengthincreases so shouldRT volume. However, the
evidence presented within their meta-analysiscannot be used
to substantiate such a position. Inferences were made stating
that competitive athletes should use eight sets per muscle
group to promote strength gains. Such a conclusion is
inconsistent with the evidence presented in their results,
specifically the small number of ESs for eight sets. They
present only six ESs contributing to the mean of the eight
sets, and as such any conclusions warrant caution. Although
not stated by the authors, the ESs presented could be derived
from only one study. In contrast, the mean presented for four
sets was accumulated from 199 ESs. Any conclusions drawn
about the direct impact of eight sets compared with any other
number of sets would be unreliable.
The meta-analysis of Wolfe et al. [7] sought to deter-
mine if the number of sets performed and the length of the

 RT programme affected outcomes. The subgroup analysis
identified that programmes that lasted between 17 and
40 weeks did not generate significantly higher ESs in
comparison with those lasting between 6 and 15 weeks.
Significant interactions were reported for the set numbers
and programme length, with multiple-set programmes
producing superior increases in strength compared with
single-set programmes (p B 0.002). Data analysis indi-
cated that trained individuals had greater increases in
strength when using multiple-set programmes (p B 0.001).
Single-set programmes were proposed to be best suited to
untrained individuals, as similar gains were noted with both
single- and multiple-set programmes. These observations
led the authors to suggest that as the subject’s progression
in strength matures, there should be a concomitant change
in programming from single to multiple sets to stimulate
continuous strength gain.
Krieger’s meta-analytic review [8] comprised 14 studies
(440 participants), with 30 treatment groups and a total of 92
ESs. The results showed that multiple sets were associated
with a larger ES than a single set (difference 0.26 ± 0.05;
95% CI 0.15–0.37; p B 0.0001). When the dose–response
model was further analysed, there was a drift towards two to
three sets per exercise compared with one set (difference
0.25 ± 0.06; 95% CI 0.14–0.37; p = 0.0001). No signifi-
cant difference was reported between one set per exercise
and four to six sets per exercise (difference 0.35 ± 0.25;
95% CI -0.05 to 0.74; p = 0.17) or between two to three sets
per exercise and three to six sets per exercise (difference
0.09 ± 0.20; 95% CI -0.31 to 0.50; p = 0.64). The possi-
bility of publication bias was assessed using methods
described by Macaskill et al. [29]. Sensitivity analysis
reported that no influential studies or publication bias were
observed. This was performed by removing each study in
turn to investigate the effect on the result of the multiple-sets
variable. Krieger [8] concluded that two to three sets per
resistance exercise was associated with 46% greater strength
gains than one set in both trained and untrained subjects.
4.2 Strengths and Limitations
There are several strengths of this meta-analysis that set it
apart from previous analyses of set configurations. The
strict inclusion criteria controlled for confounding vari-
ables when comparing the effects of LWS, MWS or HWS
on strength outcomes. This meta-analysis also considered
the potentially different effects of the use of isolation
versus multi-joint (integrated) exercises on strength out-
comes of the effects of LWS, MWS or HWS strength
programmes. The design of this study also differed from
others as it did not cluster outcomes; rather, data were
pooled across strength measures to enhance external
validity.
This analysis restricted its subject pool to male popu-
lations to better control for sex and endocrine influences.
Factors that are known to affect strength include age, sex,
physical activity levels, previous training status and
endocrine status. Sex can influence muscle functioning and
morphology [30, 31]. Men have reported greater muscle
strength and size than women, due to higher levels of
anabolic hormones and greater body size. The lower blood
androgen levels of women have also been hypothesised to
induce less relative muscle hypertrophy in response to RT
compared with men [32]. However, several studies have
failed to identify any difference between males and females
with similar relative improvements in strength adaptations
[33–35]. Tracey et al. [36] compared the hypertrophic
response of the quadriceps of older men and women after
nine weeks of training. Tracy et al. [36] reported that both
male and females had an identical response of 12% in
muscle volume. Conversely, results for upper body training
have indicated differences in response to RT in men and
women [35, 37]. Hubal et al. [38] assessed the variation in
muscle size and strength in a large cohort of men and
women (243 men, 342 women) after a 12-week unilateral
RT programme targeting the non-dominant elbow flexor of
the arm. Dynamic strength was assessed by determining the
1RM on the standard preacher curl exercise. Men and
women exhibited wide ranges of 1RM strength gains from
0 to ?250% (0 to ?10.2 kg). In addition, men experienced
2.5% greater gains in cross-sectional area (p B 0.05)
compared with women. Regardless of men having greater
absolute gains in strength, relative baseline strength
increases in strength measures were greater in women
compared with men (?25%).
Limited reliable data exist concerning the different
levels of strength after RT programmes in men and women.
The available data are from coefficients of variation (CV)
of pre- and post-training strength measures. Some studies
that analysed published means and standard deviations
found equivocal strength variability in muscle size and
strength for men and women [33, 39]. Equivocal data exist
on whether there is an effect of sex or RT or an interaction
effect between sex and RT. This may be due to issues
concerning possible sex differences in variability, poten-
tially due to small sample sizes. Previous studies found
similarities in relative strength and size changes after RT
[34, 40]. One factor that may explain these equivocal
findings is the small sample sizes that limit the statistical
power of these studies to detect significant differences
between men and women.
As with previous studies, there were limitations driven
by the shortcoming of primary data sources. Although the
present meta-analysis endeavoured to include research
papers from high-quality sources, the number of suit-
able studies was small and there remained differences in
2598
G. W. Ralston et al.
123
 design and control among included studies. One of the nine
included research papers used a randomised control design.
The other eight did not include a control group; rather, they
used a repeated measures design with baseline measure
serving as the control, but baseline measures were not
uniformly implemented across those studies. In this meta-
analysis, the strength increases may be due to the repeated
1RM testing rather than other physiological adaptations.
The exercise loading specificity of the 1RM-tested exer-
cises may have impacted upon individuals’ performance.
For example, a leg extension may have impacted upon the
leg press performance, but not to the same degree as a leg
press itself. Thus, the impact of specific RT loading versus
non-specific exercises is accounted for in this analysis.
Variation in programme order and the type of RT exercise
between groups was not equivalent in all identified studies
and this could impact upon set number and strength gain.
In addition, several sets of tested exercises versus non-
specific exercise can impact on an individual’s 1RM due to
the ‘learning’ effect of the specifically tested exercise. This
has been demonstrated by Dankel et al. [41] who conducted
1RM and maximal voluntary isometric contraction (MVC)
testing on upper body isolation exercise (elbow flexion).
One arm performed a 1RM test and MVC elbow extension
exercises while the other arm performed 1RM test and
MVC, in addition to three sets of exercises (70% 1RM) for
21 days. The results suggested that the increase in the
trained subjects’ 1RM may not have been solely related to
exercise volume, but was driven by the specificity of the
exercise. These short-term adaptations may be due to
performing the 1RM test rather than additional sets. The
increase in subjects’ 1RM may have been due to a ‘learning
effect’ caused by performing repeated testing sessions.
This increase in strength, therefore, could be attributed to
the principle of specificity as strength improvements may
not be augmented by additional volume (sets). The studies
by Ostrowski et al. [18] and Marshall et al. [20] included
specific and nonspecific exercises that would, therefore,
increase training volume. Ostrowski et al. [18] included
one, two, or four sets per week of bench press with addi-
tional nonspecific assistance exercises, while Marshall
et al. [20] included two, eight and 16 weekly sets of squats.
The pre- to post-intervention increase in strength in some
of the included isolation studies in this analysis may have
been due to neurological crossover in the untrained con-
tralateral arm. The results are applicable to isolation
exercises involving smaller muscle groups as larger mus-
cles may have different recovery patterns and properties.
4.3 Future Development and Research
This meta-analysis demonstrates that potential outliers can
affect pre- versus post-intervention strength data analysis
[24] and may invalidate or skew the results when evalu-
ating pre- to post-intervention strength difference. Previous
observations lacking well controlled screening procedures
that include unreliable evidence create difficulties for those
attempting to summarise the existing data. The findings
here suggest that researchers should be cautious when
performing mixed model meta-analyses (mixed-sex subject
groups), as this may produce spurious conclusions. There
are limitations any time a comparison that combines sub-
ject characteristics (male–female or trained–untrained, for
example) is conducted and the outcomes may or may not
be valid. The body of scientific knowledge would be
greatly improved if more RCT investigations were con-
ducted on same age/sex and similar training status to
clarify the set dose strength effects. This would help to
establish the optimum set dose–response relationship and
provide larger samples for meta-analyses, thus reducing the

 need to include low-power studies. As has been reported,
meta-analyses have limitations when including the com-
parative outcomes of aggregated effects that do not nec-
essarily assess the same construct [14]. Researchers to date
have over simplified their RT designs and have inadver-
tently produced data that provide unreliable and confusing
guidance regarding set numbers and strength gain. Sam-
pling mixed-sex groups, use of expansive age ranges, use
of multiple and different measurements, and the use of
different training methods has resulted in a moderately
large body of evidence that cannot fully answer the ques-
tion at hand individually or collectively.
5 Conclusion
Recommendations on the appropriate number of weekly
sets per resistance exercise required to elicit desired
strength gains are a divisive issue for researchers, clinicians
and fitness trainers. Within each occupational group, there
are those that dogmatically hold that an effect of LWS
training is best for creating strength and there are those that
ferociously defend HWS strength training per exercise as
the best means of gaining strength. The current literature
does little to settle this argument and the optimal sets-to-
strength
gain
relationship
remains
unquantified.
The
ACSM [10], in a position stand statement presented to the
public as authoritative, has added to the confusion because
it
is
based
on
limited
evidence
and
oversimplified
recommendations.
The current meta-analysis presents additional evidence
regarding a graded dose–response relationship between sets
and strength. The prescription of RT for strength gains is a
complex process of manipulating programme variables. A
known reference relationship between sets and strength
gain would be invaluable to every practitioner whether they
are clinic or gym based. This research project analysed a
limited set of available data and cautiously advocates the
use of MWS for beginners, novice trainers, or the time-
dependent trainer. For well-trained individuals, the use of
either MWS or HWS strength training may be appropriate.
These more advanced trainees may benefit from additional
time and training volume to reap the smaller increases in
performance normally seen at this level of training pro-
gression. A consideration with this advanced group is the
interaction of additional strength training volume and time
with the achievement of other fitness goals. For those
trainees in the middle ground, not a novice and not
advanced, the existing data provide a relationship between
weekly sets and strength gain, as a graded response to
additional weekly sets produced increases in pre- versus
post-intervention strength. This suggests that MWS or
HWS strength training is appropriate for this group. It is
very apparent that more investigations and replication
studies using appropriate study designs and comparable
subject samples are required.
