Background
Comprehensive geriatric assessment (CGA) is a multi-dimensional, multi-disciplinary diagnostic and therapeutic process conducted
to determine the medical, mental, and functional problems of older people with frailty so that a co-ordinated and integrated plan for
treatment and follow-up can be developed. This is an update of a previously published Cochrane review.
Objectives
We sought to critically appraise and summarise current evidence on the effectiveness and resource use of CGA for older adults admitted
to hospital, and to use these data to estimate its cost-effectiveness.
Search methods
We searched CENTRAL, MEDLINE, Embase, three other databases, and two trials registers on 5 October 2016; we also checked
reference lists and contacted study authors.
Selection criteria
We included randomised trials that compared inpatient CGA (delivered on geriatric wards or by mobile teams) versus usual care on a
general medical ward or on a ward for older people, usually admitted to hospital for acute care or for inpatient rehabilitation after an
acute admission.

 Data collection and analysis
We followed standard methodological procedures expected by Cochrane and Effective Practice and Organisation of Care (EPOC).
We used the GRADE approach to assess the certainty of evidence for the most important outcomes. For this update, we requested
individual patient data (IPD) from trialists, and we conducted a survey of trialists to obtain details of delivery of CGA. We calculated
risk ratios (RRs), mean differences (MDs), or standardised mean differences (SMDs), and combined data using fixed-effect meta-
analysis. We estimated cost-effectiveness by comparing inpatient CGA versus hospital admission without CGA in terms of cost per
quality-adjusted life year (QALY) gained, cost per life year (LY) gained, and cost per life year living at home (LYLAH) gained.
Main results
We included 29 trials recruiting 13,766 participants across nine, mostly high-income countries. CGA increases the likelihood that
patients will be alive and in their own homes at 3 to 12 months’ follow-up (risk ratio (RR) 1.06, 95% confidence interval (CI) 1.01 to
1.10; 16 trials, 6799 participants; high-certainty evidence), results in little or no difference in mortality at 3 to 12 months’ follow-up
(RR 1.00, 95% CI 0.93 to 1.07; 21 trials, 10,023 participants; high-certainty evidence), decreases the likelihood that patients will be
admitted to a nursing home at 3 to 12 months follow-up (RR 0.80, 95% CI 0.72 to 0.89; 14 trials, 6285 participants; high-certainty
evidence) and results in little or no difference in dependence (RR 0.97, 95% CI 0.89 to 1.04; 14 trials, 6551 participants; high-certainty
evidence). CGA may make little or no difference to cognitive function (SMD ranged from -0.22 to 0.35 (5 trials, 3534 participants;
low-certainty evidence)). Mean length of stay ranged from 1.63 days to 40.7 days in the intervention group, and ranged from 1.8 days
to 42.8 days in the comparison group. Healthcare costs per participant in the CGA group were on average GBP 234 (95% CI GBP -
144 to GBP 605) higher than in the usual care group (17 trials, 5303 participants; low-certainty evidence). CGA may lead to a slight
increase in QALYs of 0.012 (95% CI -0.024 to 0.048) at GBP 19,802 per QALY gained (3 trials; low-certainty evidence), a slight
increase in LYs of 0.037 (95% CI 0.001 to 0.073), at GBP 6305 per LY gained (4 trials; low-certainty evidence), and a slight increase
in LYLAH of 0.019 (95% CI -0.019 to 0.155) at GBP 12,568 per LYLAH gained (2 trials; low-certainty evidence). The probability
that CGA would be cost-effective at a GBP 20,000 ceiling ratio for QALY, LY, and LYLAH was 0.50, 0.89, and 0.47, respectively (17
trials, 5303 participants; low-certainty evidence).
Authors’ conclusions
Older patients are more likely to be alive and in their own homes at follow-up if they received CGA on admission to hospital. We
are uncertain whether data show a difference in effect between wards and teams, as this analysis was underpowered. CGA may lead to
a small increase in costs, and evidence for cost-effectiveness is of low-certainty due to imprecision and inconsistency among studies.
Further research that reports cost estimates that are setting-specific across different sectors of care are required.

Comprehensive geriatric assessment for older adults admitted to hospital
What is the aim of this review?
The aim of this Cochrane Review was to find out if organised and co-ordinated specialist care (known as comprehensive geriatric
assessment, or CGA) can improve care provided to older people admitted to hospital. Researchers at Cochrane collected and analysed
all relevant studies to answer this question and included 29 trials in the review.
Key messages
Giving older people who are admitted to hospital access to specialist co-ordinated geriatric assessment (CGA) services on admission to
hospital increases the chances that they will be alive in their own homes at follow-up.
What was studied in the review?
Older people admitted to hospital may have multiple, complex, and overlapping problems. They are more prone to rapid loss of
independence during an acute illness, leading to potential admission to a nursing home. Some of this decline might be avoided if care
needs are identified appropriately and if treatment is co-ordinated and managed. Specialist co-ordinated care (known as comprehensive
geriatric assessment, or CGA) was developed to address medical, social, mental health, and physical needs with the help of a skilled
multi-disciplinary team. The aims are to maximise recovery and to return patients to previous levels of function when possible. In
hospital, CGA is carried out on a geriatric ward, or on a general ward that is visited by a specialist geriatric team.

 What are the main results of the review?
Review authors found 29 relevant trials from nine countries that recruited 13,766 people. These studies compared CGA with routine
care for patients over 65 who were admitted to hospital. Most trials evaluated CGA that was provided on a specialised hospital ward
or across several wards by a mobile team. The review shows that older people who receive CGA rather than routine medical care after
admission to hospital are more likely to be living at home and are less likely to be admitted to a nursing home at up to a year after
hospital admission.
We found no evidence that CGA reduces risk of death during follow-up at up to a year after admission, and we noted that CGA
appeared to make little or no difference in dependence (whether patients need help for everyday activities such as feeding and walking).
We found too much variation in cognitive function and length of hospital stay to draw a conclusion. Uncertainty regarding the cost-
effectiveness analysis suggests that further research is needed.
How up-to-date is this review?
Review authors searched for studies that had been published up to 5 October 2016.

Comprehensive geriatric assessment for older adults admitted to hospital (Review)
Copyright © 2017 The Cochrane Collaboration. Published by John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.
 B A C K G R O U N D
The number of adults surviving into old age is on the rise in
populations around the world (The Lancet 2014; WHO 2016).
This changing demographic has contributed to an increase in
emergency hospital admissions that is having an impact on de-
livery of healthcare services. In England, emergency admissions
increased by 47% between 1997-1998 and 2012-2013 (National
Audit Office 2013), and in the USA by 16.7% between 2003 and
2009 (Morganti 2013). Older adults (over age 65) now represent
the largest users of hospital care (National Audit Office 2013). The
concern of practitioners is that this increase in admissions, against
the backdrop of reduction in hospital beds, places provision of safe
sustainable health care for older adults at risk (Francis 2013; Royal
College of Physicians 2012; The Lancet 2014).
Description of the condition
The combination of multi-morbidity (Barnett 2012), age-related
frailty, and acute illness places older people at increased risk for
adverse outcomes. These include longer-term dependence, admis-
sion to a nursing home, and death (Clegg 2013). Frailty (“defined
as the inability to withstand illness or insult without loss of func-
tion”) is characterised by typical frailty syndromes (falls, reduced
mobility, increased confusion, etc.) (Clegg 2013).
Description of the intervention
Comprehensive geriatric assessment (CGA) was developed in re-
sponse to concern that problems experienced by older people who
require hospital-level care are not recognised and acted on. CGA
is a multi-dimensional diagnostic and therapeutic process that is
focused on determining a frail older person’s medical, functional,
mental, and social capabilities and limitations with the goal of
ensuring that problems are identified, quantified, and managed
appropriately. CGA has the potential to improve health outcomes
while reducing the costs of health care and social care (Rubenstein
1991).
How the intervention might work
Models of CGA have evolved in different healthcare settings to
meet differing needs. Common to these interventions are the fol-
lowing key features, which are believed to account for their effec-
tiveness.
• Specialty expertise.
• Multi-dimensional assessment and identification of
medical, functional, mental, social, and environmental problems.
• Co-ordinated multi-disciplinary meetings.
• Formulation of a plan of care around patient-centred goals.
• Delivery of the care plan, including rehabilitation.
• Iterative review of progress and care planning.
Key components that have been reported to be associated with
improved CGA outcomes include ability to implement treatment
recommendations provided by the multi-disciplinary team and to
target the intervention to patients who present with frailty syn-
dromes (Ellis 2011; Stuck 1993), as described above (Bachmann
2010).
Why it is important to do this review
Searches for the previous version of this review were completed in
2010 (Ellis 2011). Access to individual patient data (IPD) from a
subgroup of trials, along with additional details of delivery of the
intervention provided by trialists, has allowed us to estimate the
cost-effectiveness of delivering CGA.
O B J E C T I V E S
We sought to critically appraise and summarise current evidence
on the effectiveness and resource use of CGA in hospital for older
adults admitted to hospital, and to use these data to estimate its
cost-effectiveness.

Criteria for considering studies for this review
Types of studies
Individual participant and cluster-randomised trials.
Types of participants
Participants 65 years of age or older who were admitted to hospital
for acute care or inpatient rehabilitation after an acute admission
with medical, psychological, functional, or social problems.
Types of interventions
Comprehensive geriatric assessment (CGA) can be delivered on a
specialist CGA ward or across several wards by a mobile team. On
a CGA ward, care is provided by a specialist team that conducts
a tailored assessment across a variety of domains, while possibly
using standardised assessment tools to gather information. Assess-
ment findings are discussed in a multi-disciplinary meeting, and a
plan of treatment is developed. Members of the multi-disciplinary
team are responsible for delivering the recommended treatment

 or rehabilitation plan (such as physiotherapy, occupational ther-
apy, or medical treatment). CGA delivered by a mobile team also
includes a multi-disciplinary assessment of a patient that is per-
formed on one or more general medical wards. This is followed by
a multi-disciplinary team meeting that results in a recommended
plan for treatment with recommendations passed on to the ward
team (medical and nursing staff). Multi-disciplinary team mem-
bers may or may not be involved in delivering direct care (e.g.
physiotherapy input).
We searched for trials that compared CGA for older people (over
65) admitted to hospital (conducted on CGA wards or by mobile
team) versus general medical care.
We excludedstudiesof condition-specificinterventions(e.g.stroke
units, geriatric orthopaedic rehabilitation) that require special-
ist skills for assessment, acute management, and rehabilitation
(Handoll 2009; SUTC 2013).
Types of outcome measures
Primary outcomes
• Living at home (the inverse of death or institutionalisation
combined; used to describe someone who is alive and in own
home at follow-up)
Secondary outcomes
• Mortality (death)
• Admission to a nursing home
• Dependence
• Activities of daily living (as measured and reported by
trialists)
• Cognitive function
• Length of stay
• Re-admission
• Cost and cost-effectiveness

Data collection and analysis
Selection of studies
One review author (MG) read all abstracts and retrieved full-text
papers for publications that appeared relevant. Two review authors
(MG, GE) independently assessed their eligibility, selected studies
for inclusion in the review according to prespecified inclusion cri-
teria, and resolved disagreements by discussion with a third review
author (SS).
Data extraction and management
Tworeviewauthors(MG, GE)independentlyextracteddata,using
a modified version of the Cochrane good practice extraction form (
EPOC2017a). We resolveddisagreementsandareasof uncertainty
by discussion with SS.
We contacted investigators of included trials by email or by tele-
phone to invite them to contribute trial data and to complete a
questionnaire to provide details about delivery of CGA. This sur-
vey included questions on the population using the service; inter-
vention characteristics (including details of core team members);
key components of the CGA intervention; and control group char-
acteristics. We sent each trialist a minimum of three reminders to
provide this information.
Survey of trialists
We contacted investigators of included trials by email or by tele-
phone to invite them to contribute trial data and to complete a
questionnaire to provide details about delivery of CGA. We sent
a minimum of three reminders to each trialist. We sent a survey
7

 to trialists of the 29 trials included in the review to obtain a de-
tailed description of the CGA models evaluated in these trials.
The survey included questions on the population using the ser-
vice; intervention characteristics (including details of core team
members); key components of the CGA intervention; and control
group characteristics.
Assessment of risk of bias in included studies
Three review authors (MG, GE, SS) independently assessed risk of
bias of included trials by using the suggested risk of bias criteria and
guidance for EPOC reviews (EPOC 2017b). We resolved areas of
uncertainty or disagreement by discussion.
Measures of treatment effect
We calculated risk ratios (RRs) with 95% confidence intervals
(CIs) using fixed-effect inverse variance meta-analysis for living at
home, mortality, admission to a nursing home, and dependence
as measured by an activities of daily living scale (Deeks 2001; see
Analysis 1.7 for details).
For the continuous outcomes ’activities of daily living’ (ADLs)
and ’cognitive function’, we calculated standardised mean differ-
ences (SMDs) and for the continuous outcome ’length of stay’,
we calculated mean differences (MDs). We calculated odds ratios
(ORs) with 95% CIs for data from studies that provided individ-
ual patient data (IPD) using logistic regression meta-analysis.
Unit of analysis issues
All included trials were individual participant randomised trials.
We noted no unit of analysis issues.
Dealing with missing data
We contacted the authors of included trials to request missing
data.
Assessment of heterogeneity
We carried out tests of heterogeneity using Cochran’s Q and the
I² statistic (Cochran 1954; Higgins 2003). We did not retain a
pooled analysis if values of I² were greater than 70%. We also
considered trial characteristics such as CGA delivered by a team or
on a geriatric ward, and we grouped studies on the basis of these
characteristics.
Assessment of reporting biases
We assessed reporting bias by creating a funnel plot for the main
outcome (livingathome)at3to12months’ follow-up, recognising
that when a small number of trials are included, these plots are
not necessarily indicative of publication bias.
Data synthesis
We combined published data using fixed-effect meta-analysis for
living at home, death, admitted to a nursing home, dependence,
ADLs, cognitive function, re-admissions, and length of stay. We
grouped trials by ward or by team for all outcomes, as suggested by
previous reviews (Ellis 2011; Stuck 1993). When multi-arm trials
are included (Cohen 2002 GEMC; Nikolaus 1999), we analysed
each intervention group separately and described this analysis in
the table of included trials. We calculated standardised mean dif-
ferences for the different scales used to measure ADLs and cog-
nitive function. We analysed dependence by combining a binary
definition of dependence (as defined by trials) with deterioration
in ADLs.
We conducted a meta-regression analysis by using a fixed-effect
model to assess effects of trial covariates on living at home at the
end of follow-up (3 to 12 months) (Thompson 1999). Trial co-
variates consisted of team or ward intervention; age or frailty as a
criterion for targeting delivery of CGA (frailty typically included
criteria such as geriatric syndromes, risk of nursing home admis-
sion, and functional or cognitive impairment); timing of admis-
sion from emergency department directly or after 72 hours (step-
down); and outpatient follow-up. We used post-estimation Wald
tests to derive F ratios and P values.
We used STATA version 13 and Review Manager 5 when per-
forming all analyses (Review Manager 2014; STATA 13) .
In the survey, we asked trialists to report elements of CGA that
were most critical to success; processes of care followed; and staff
profiles of the control group. We counted these elements of CGA,
and reported them in the results as a fraction of the total number
of trialists (N = 13).
Cost-effectiveness
We used length of inpatient stay (measured in days) from 17 tri-
als as the main driver of resource use (Analysis 1.10), and we
derived the costs of providing CGA from IPD provided by one
trial (Primary AMIGOS Trial, Edmans 2013; cost-effectiveness
study, Tanajewski 2015); this trial evaluated a version of CGA that
included an attending geriatrician in a medical assessment unit
and outpatient follow-up. We valued relative costs using English
unit cost prices for 2013/2014, taking a National Health Service
(NHS) perspective (NICE 2013), and we compared incremental
health outcomes of CGA versus usual care.
For trials that reported the cost of CGA, we used the following
measure of cost-effectiveness.
• We calculated quality-adjusted life-years (QALYs) by
converting Barthel Index IPD provided by Edmans 2013,
Kircher 2007, and Saltvedt 2002 to EQ-5D-3L (EuroQoL
Group Quality of Life Questionnaire based on a three-level scale)
UK scores according to Kaambwa 2013. We used data from trials
with mean Barthel scores at baseline ranging from 14.0 to 15.2,
on a scale of 0 to 20, as these were similar to scores reported in
8

Copyright © 2017 The Cochrane Collaboration. Published by John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.
 the mapping study of Kaambwa 2013 (from 14.8 to 16.5, on a
scale of 0 to 20). Edmans 2013 provided IPD for the EQ-5D;
this allowed us to compare calculated QALYs based on the
Barthel index versus QALYs based on EQ-5D (Edmans 2013).
• We estimated life-years (LYs) using IPD from four trials by
calculating time to death from recruitment, expressed as a
fraction of a year (Edmans 2013; Goldberg 2013; Kircher 2007;
Saltvedt 2002).
• We created a variable called ’life years living at home’
(LYLAHs) after discharge from hospital to use as a measure of
independence and well-being in an older population; this was
based on IPD from Edmans 2013 and Goldberg 2013.
We used a decision model to estimate an incremental cost-effec-
tiveness ratio (ICER) of inpatient care with or without CGA. The
ICER is expressed as cost per QALY gained, cost per LY gained,
and cost per LYLAH gained from a health service perspective. We
multiplied the RR of living at home at the end of follow-up by
the incremental LYLAH, to adjust LYLAH with the probability
of living at home (Analysis 1.2). We presented in Table 1 the in-
put parameters used in these models. We addressed uncertainty by
performing 10,000 draws of all incremental cost and incremental
health outcome parameters using prespecified distributions, and
by recording incremental costs, incremental QALYs, incremental
LYs, and incremental LYLAHs from each draw. We plotted these
results on a cost-effectiveness plane (i.e. a scatterplot graph with
incremental costs on the y-axis and incremental effects on the x-
axis) and on a cost-effectiveness acceptability curve (i.e. a graph
that displays the probability that an intervention will be cost-ef-
fective at different values of a QALY) to display uncertainty in the
estimated ICERs.
Certainty of evidence
We graded our confidence in the evidence by creating a ’Sum-
mary of findings’ table, using the approach recommended by
the GRADE Working Group and guidance developed by EPOC
(EPOC 2017c; Guyatt 2008). We included the most important
outcomes of living at home, mortality, admission to a nursing
home, dependence, cognitive function, hospital length of stay,
and cost-effectiveness. We used methods and recommendations
described in Section 8.5 and Chapter 12 of the Cochrane Hand-
book for Systematic Reviews of Interventions (Higgins 2011), along
with GRADE worksheets, to assess the certainty of evidence
(GRADEpro GDT 2015). Three review authors (MG, SS, GE)
independently assessed the certainty of evidence.
Subgroup analysis and investigation of heterogeneity
We conducted fixed-effect logistic regression meta-analyses on
IPD from five studies (N = 1767 participants) for two out-
comes: living at home and mortality (Edmans 2013; Goldberg
2013; Kircher 2007; Somme 2010; Saltvedt 2002). We analysed a
third outcome (time to death) by performing fixed-effect time-to-
eventmeta-analysis(Edmans 2013; Goldberg 2013; Kircher2007;
Somme 2010). We adjusted all three meta-analyses for participant
age and sex and baseline Barthel Index by applying a threshold of
≤ 15/20 for moderate to severe disability (Rudd 1997).
We created a model for each trial, and we pooled parameters using
a weighted average. We combined log odds ratios for living at
home and death, using fixed-effect inverse variance meta-analysis
(Deeks 2001). We used Cox regression models to calculate the log
hazard ratio and its standard error for living at home and death
separately for each trial data set. We expressed the pooled effect as
the hazard ratio for inpatient CGA compared with general medical
care.
Sensitivity analysis
We ran a random-effects meta-analysis in a sensitivity analysis for
primary outcomes and compared these results with results of fixed-
effect meta-analysis (Deeks 2001; DerSimonian 1986); we also
assessed the impact of excluding three trials that included partici-
pants who were admitted from a nursing home for the outcomes
living at home and admitted to a nursing home (Asplund 2000;
McVey 1989; Rubenstein 1984). We assessed the impact of using
data at 6 months’ follow-up, rather than at 12 months’ follow-up,
for three trials (Applegate 1990; Counsell 2000; Saltvedt 2002),
for the primary outcome living at home (end of follow-up 3 to 12
months).
We performed two univariate sensitivity analyses for the cost-ef-
fectiveness analysis. In the first (van Exel 2004), we mapped EQ-
5D utilities to the Barthel Index using data from two trials that
recruited a more dependent population (mean Barthel Index of
9 at baseline) (Goldberg 2013; Somme 2010); in the second, we
used the RR for delivering CGA on a dedicated ward and ex-
cluded studies evaluating CGA delivered by mobile teams for the
outcomes living at home (Analysis 1.2); and being admitted to a
nursing home at the end of follow-up (Analysis 1.6).

 Included studies
See Characteristics of included studies.
We included 29 randomised trials involving 13,766 participants
that examined the effectiveness of CGA provided for older adults
admitted to hospital.
Most included trials were conducted in North America: 16 in the
USA and four in Canada. Two trials were conducted in Germany
and in the UK, and single trials were reported from Australia,
China, Norway, France, and Sweden. Eleven trials targeted CGA
to the frailest or most at-risk participants (Applegate 1990; Cohen
2002 GEMC; Edmans 2013; Goldberg 2013; Kay 1992; Kircher
2007; Nikolaus 1999; Rubenstein 1984; Saltvedt 2002; White
1994; Winograd 1993), and 11 targeted CGA on the basis of
age alone (Asplund 2000; Barnes 2012; Collard 1985; Counsell
2000; Fretwell 1990; Harris 1991; Landefeld 1995; McVey 1989;
Naughton 1994; Somme 2010; Wald 2011).
Trialists delivered CGA in a dedicated geriatric ward environ-
ment in 20 trials (Applegate 1990; Asplund 2000; Barnes 2012;
Boustani 2012; Cohen 2002 GEMC; Collard 1985; Counsell
2000; Fretwell 1990; Goldberg 2013; Harris 1991; Kay 1992;

Saltvedt 2002; Shamian 1984; Somme 2010; Wald 2011; White
1994), and by using a mobile team on a general medical ward in
eight trials (Edmans 2013; Hogan 1987; Kircher 2007; McVey
1989; Naughton 1994; Reuben 1995; Thomas 1993; Winograd
1993).

 In the AMIGOS trial (Edmans 2013; Tanajewski 2015), the in-
tervention was case management by a geriatrician at the point of
discharge from an acute medical unit, and no other staff served as
core team members. In one trial (Goldberg 2013), the CGA inter-
vention consisted of care in a specialist medical and mental health
unit that admitted people with delirium or dementia. We counted
Cohen 2002 GEMC as two trials, as the investigators used a 2 × 2
factorial design that compared care received in an inpatient geri-
atric evaluation and management unit versus usual care, followed
by outpatient care in a geriatric evaluation and management clinic
versus usual outpatient care (Cohen 2002 UCOP; Cohen 2002
GEMC). We also counted Nikolaus 1999 as two trials owing to
the different CGA interventions evaluated: CGA ward and CGA
ward plus early supported discharge intervention versus usual care
(Nikolaus 1999; Nikolaus 1999 plus ESD).
Most trials described the control group as receiving usual care.
In three trials, the control group received enhanced usual care
(Boustani 2012; Edmans 2013; Goldberg 2013), and in one trial
(Goldberg 2013), care on geriatric medical wards (70%) and gen-
eral medical wards (30%). In another study (Boustani 2012),
49% of the control group received CGA compared with 56% of
the intervention group. Nine trials provided outpatient follow-
up (Barnes 2012; Cohen 2002 GEMC; Collard 1985; Counsell
2000; Edmans 2013; Fretwell 1990; Naughton 1994; Nikolaus
1999 plus ESD; Rubenstein 1984). Duration of follow-up ranged
from 3 to 12 months.
Elements of CGA
Thirteen of the 29 trialists completed the survey (Applegate 1990;
Asplund 2000; Edmans 2013; Goldberg 2013; Hogan 1987;
Kircher 2007; Reuben 1995; Rubenstein 1984; Saltvedt 2002;
Somme 2010; Thomas 1993; Wald 2011; White 1994), and re-
ported tailoring treatment plans to the individual (13/13 trials);
holding multi-disciplinary team meetings (12/13 trials); provid-
ing clinical leadership (11/13 trials); having speciality knowledge,
experience, and competence (11/13 trials); and involving partici-
pants and carers in goal setting (10/13 trials) were the most com-
mon key components of CGA (Figure 3). In Figure 4, we detailed
the processes of care and information on staff working in the con-
trol group, as reported by the trialists. In Figure 2, we displayed
the staff profile of the CGA intervention group for comparison.

 Excluded studies
We excluded eight trials. Reasons for exclusion were secondary
analyses (Gharacholou 2012; Nipp 2012) of an included trial
(Cohen 2002 GEMC); a non-randomised study (Mudge 2012;
Yoo 2013a; Yoo 2013b; Yoo 2014); an ineligible intervention
(Abizanda 2011); and elective admission of participants to in-
patient care (Kehusmaa 2010). (See Characteristics of excluded
studies.)
Risk of bias in included studies
We reported risk of bias assessments of the included studies in
Figure 5. As two trials were available only as abstracts reporting
limited information (Li 2015; Powell 1990), we were unable to
complete a risk of bias assessment. For the domain of other bias,
we assessed risk of bias due to contamination of the control group.
Figure 5.
’Risk of bias’ graph: review authors’ judgements about each risk of bias item presented as
percentages across all 29 included studies. Only one risk of bias classification is given for the split studies
(Cohen 2002 GEMC and Cohen 2002 UCOP; Nikolaus 1999 and Nikolaus 1999 plus ESD). therefore represents
the risk of bias classification for the 29 included studies. White spaces reflect the unassessed split studies.
Allocation
We assessed 26 trials as having low or unclear risk of bias for ran-
dom sequence generation, and one trial as having high risk of
bias (Wald 2011), as the sequence was generated by odd or even
numbers on the medical record. For allocation concealment, we
classified 25 trials as having low (Asplund 2000; Barnes 2012;
Cohen 2002 GEMC; Counsell 2000; Edmans 2013; Goldberg
2013; Landefeld 1995; Naughton 1994; Nikolaus 1999 plus ESD;
Saltvedt 2002; Somme 2010; Winograd 1993), or unclear risk
of bias (Applegate 1990; Boustani 2012; Collard 1985; Fretwell
1990; Hogan 1987 ;Kay 1992; Kircher 2007; McVey 1989;
Reuben 1995; Rubenstein 1984; Shamian 1984; Thomas 1993;
White 1994). We assessed two trials as having high risk of bias for
allocation concealment because investigators used an open alloca-
tion schedule (Harris 1991; Wald 2011).
Blinding
We classified all trials as having high risk of performance bias, as it
wasnotpossible toblindparticipants orresearcherstothe allocated
intervention (detection bias). We assessed objective measures of
outcome as having low risk of bias, including the primary outcome
’living at home’. We assessed several trials as having low risk of bias
for blinding of assessment of subjective outcomes, as researchers
describedoutcome assessorsasblindtothe allocation(Cohen 2002
GEMC; Goldberg 2013; Kircher 2007; McVey 1989; Naughton
1994; Nikolaus 1999 plus ESD; Nikolaus 1999). One trial stated
that outcome assessors were not blinded to functional status, and
we assessed this study as having high risk of bias (Wald 2011).
Incomplete outcome data
We assessed three trials as having high risk of bias for addressing
incomplete outcome data (attrition bias) (Asplund 2000; Collard
1985; Naughton 1994). One trial reported attrition for functional
outcomes that exceeded 25% (Collard 1985). We classified six tri-

 als as having low risk of bias for incomplete outcome data (attri-
tion bias) (Barnes 2012; Boustani 2012; Fretwell 1990; Goldberg
2013; Kircher 2007; Landefeld 1995). We classified 18 trials as
having unclear risk of bias (Applegate 1990; Cohen 2002 GEMC;
Counsell 2000; Edmans 2013; Harris 1991; Hogan 1987; Kay
1992; McVey 1989; Nikolaus 1999 plus ESD; Reuben 1995;
Rubenstein 1984; Saltvedt 2002; Shamian 1984; Somme 2010;
Thomas 1993; Wald 2011; White 1994; Winograd 1993), as in-
vestigators provided no data on attrition or exclusions.
Selective reporting
Twenty-five trials did not publish a protocol, hence we assessed
them as having unclear risk of selective reporting bias. Four tri-
als did publish protocols (Edmans 2013; Goldberg 2013; Kircher
2007; Reuben 1995), and two trials published protocols with pre-
specified outcomes (Edmans 2011; Harwood 2011).
Other potential sources of bias
We assessed risk of bias due to contamination of the control
group. A total of 21 trials provided little evidence that the con-
trol group had received CGA (Applegate 1990; Asplund 2000;
Barnes 2012; Cohen 2002 GEMC; Collard 1985; Counsell 2000;
Edmans 2013; Fretwell 1990; Harris 1991; Hogan 1987; Kay
1992; Landefeld 1995; McVey 1989; Naughton 1994; Rubenstein
1984; Saltvedt2002; Shamian1984; Somme 2010; Thomas 1993;
White 1994; Winograd 1993). In six trials, it is likely that the
control group received the intervention, hence we classified these
trials as having high risk of bias as to whether the study adequately
protected against contamination (Boustani 2012; Goldberg 2013;
Kircher 2007; Nikolaus 1999 plus ESD; Reuben 1995; Wald
2011). In one of these trials (Boustani 2012), 49% of the control
group versus 56% of the intervention group received CGA; we
did not include data from this trial in the meta-analysis.
We assessed publication bias by creating a funnel plot for the main
outcome living at home at the end of follow-up (Figure 6). The
Harbord test (bias = 0.87, P = 0.18) and Egger’s test (bias = 0.87,
P = 0.17) show little evidence of small-trial bias for the main
outcome living at home at the end of follow-up (3 to 12 months).

 Effects of interventions
See: Summary of findings for the main comparison
Comprehensive geriatric assessment (CGA) versus admission to
hospital without CGA
Living at home
CGA increases the likelihood that patients will be alive and in
their own homes (’living at home’) at hospital discharge (risk ratio
(RR) 1.05, 95% confidence interval (CI) 1.01 to 1.10; 11 trials;
4346 participants (32% of the total number of participants); high-
certaintyevidence; I²=43%)(Barnes 2012; Collard1985; Fretwell
1990; Kay 1992; Landefeld 1995; McVey 1989; Naughton 1994;
Rubenstein 1984; Wald 2011; White 1994; Winograd 1993). See
Analysis 1.1.
CGA also increases the likelihood that patients will be ’living at
home’ at 3 to 12 months’ follow-up (RR 1.06, 95% CI 1.01
to 1.10; 16 trials; 6799 participants (49% of the total number
of participants); high-certainty evidence; I² = 13%) (Applegate
1990; Asplund 2000; Cohen 2002 GEMC; Cohen 2002 UCOP;
Counsell 2000; Edmans 2013; Goldberg 2013; Kircher 2007;
Landefeld1995; McVey 1989; Nikolaus 1999; Nikolaus 1999 plus
ESD; Rubenstein 1984; Saltvedt 2002; Somme 2010; Winograd
1993). See Analysis 1.2.
Mortality (death)
CGA results in little or no difference in mortality at discharge (RR
1.04, 95%CI0.82to1.32; 11 trials; 4346 participants(32%of the
total number of participants); high-certainty evidence; I² = 16%)
(Barnes 2012; Collard 1985; Fretwell 1990; Kay 1992; Landefeld
1995; McVey 1989; Naughton 1994; Rubenstein 1984; Wald
2011; White 1994; Winograd 1993), or at 3 to 12 months’ follow-
up (RR 1.00, 95% CI 0.93 to 1.07; 21 trials; 10,023 participants
(73%of the total numberof participants); high-certaintyevidence;
I² = 0%) (Applegate 1990; Asplund 2000; Cohen 2002 GEMC;
Cohen 2002 UCOP; Counsell 2000; Edmans 2013; Fretwell
1990; Goldberg 2013; Harris 1991; Kircher 2007; Landefeld
1995; McVey 1989; Nikolaus 1999; Nikolaus 1999 plus ESD;
Reuben 1995; Rubenstein 1984; Saltvedt 2002; Shamian 1984;
Somme 2010; Thomas 1993; Winograd 1993). See Analysis 1.3
and Analysis 1.4.
Admission to a nursing home during follow-up
CGA decreases the likelihood that patients will be admitted to a
nursing home at discharge (RR 0.89, 95% CI 0.81 to 0.98; 12
trials; 4459 participants (32% of the total number of participants);
high-certainty evidence; I² = 31%) (Barnes 2012; Collard 1985;
Fretwell 1990; Hogan 1987; Kay 1992; Landefeld 1995; McVey
1989; Naughton 1994; Rubenstein 1984; Wald 2011; White
1994; Winograd 1993); and at 3 to 12 months’ follow-up (RR
0.80, 95% CI 0.72 to 0.89; 14 trials; 6285 participants (46%
of the total number of participants); high-certainty evidence; I²
= 3%) (Applegate 1990; Asplund 2000; Cohen 2002 GEMC;
Cohen 2002 UCOP; Counsell 2000; Edmans 2013; Goldberg
2013; Kircher 2007; Landefeld 1995; McVey 1989; Nikolaus
1999; Nikolaus 1999 plus ESD; Rubenstein 1984; Saltvedt 2002;
Winograd 1993). See Analysis 1.5 and Analysis 1.6. It is not clear
from the trials that contributed to the analysis of admission to
nursing home at discharge if participants were a new nursing home
admission, or if they had previously resided in a nursing home.
Dependence
CGA results in little or no difference in dependence (RR 0.97,
95% CI 0.89 to 1.04; 14 trials; 6551 participants (48% of
the total number of participants); high-certainty evidence; I² =
0%) (Asplund 2000; Barnes 2012; Collard 1985; Counsell 2000;
Edmans 2013; Fretwell 1990; Landefeld 1995; McVey 1989;
Nikolaus 1999; Nikolaus 1999 plus ESD; Rubenstein 1984;
Saltvedt 2002; Somme 2010; Thomas 1993). We included data
from one trial despite a large dropout rate (25.7% for interven-
tion; 44.0% for control) for this one outcome (Collard 1985).
Analysis that excludes the data from this trial has little effect on
the summary estimate (RR 0.95, 95% CI 0.88 to 1.04; 13 trials;
6122 participants (44% of the total number of participants); I² =
0%). See Analysis 1.7.
Cognitive function
A total of five trials reported cognitive function at follow-up, due
to a high level of statistical heterogeneity we did not retain the
meta-analysis (3534 participants (26% of the total number of
participants); low-certainty evidence; I2 = 73%) (Asplund 2000;
Goldberg 2013; Kircher 2007; Reuben 1995; Winograd 1993).
For cognitive function we calculated standardised mean differ-
ences to standardise the results of the studies to a uniform scale
before they could be combined. This was because the outcome
was measured in a variety of ways.The standardised mean differ-
ence ranged from -0.22 to 0.35. We are uncertain of the impact
of CGA on cognitive function, as the certainty of this evidence is
low.
Length of stay
A total of 17 trials reported length of stay data. Owing to a
high level of statistical heterogeneity, we did not retain the meta-
analysis (5303 participants (39% of the total number of par-
ticipants); low-certainty evidence; I² = 80%) (Asplund 2000;
Cohen 2002 GEMC; Cohen 2002 UCOP; Edmans 2013;
Fretwell 1990; Goldberg 2013; Harris 1991; Hogan 1987; McVey
1989; Naughton 1994; Nikolaus 1999; Nikolaus 1999 plus
ESD; Saltvedt 2002; Somme 2010; Thomas 1993; Wald 2011;
Winograd 1993). Mean hospital length of stay ranged from 3.4

 days to 40.7 days in the CGA group, and from 3.1 days to 42.8
days in the control group, with a mean difference of -23.60 to
9.00 days. See Analysis 1.10.
Costs and cost-effectiveness
Table 2 presents the costs reported by trialists; owing to variation
in time periods (1985 to 2013) and in resources that were costed
we did not include these data in the analysis of costs. Instead, we
used length of inpatient stay, as this unit is commonly used in
costing hospital resources because it is the main driver of resource
use. We used the meta-analysis of published data from 17 trials
to estimate the incremental cost, as well as individual patient data
(IPD) from five trials to estimate incremental health outcomes of
CGA versus usual care (Edmans 2013; Goldberg 2013; Kircher
2007; Saltvedt2002; Somme 2010). We estimatedhealthcare costs
(including hospitalisation and intervention costs) per participant
in the CGA group at GBP 234 higher than general medical care
without CGA (95% CI GBP -£144 to GBP 605) (17 trials; low-
certainty evidence). CGA may lead to a slight increase in QALYs
of 0.012 (95% CI -0.024 to 0.048) at GBP 19,802 per QALY
gained (3 trials provided data on QALYS and 17 trials provided
data on resource use; low-certainty evidence), a slight increase
in LYs of 0.037 (95% CI 0.001 to 0.073) at GBP 6305 per LY
gained (4 trials provided data on LYs and 17 trials provided data
on resource use; low-certainty evidence), and a slight increase in
LYLAH of 0.019 (95% CI -0.019 to 0.155) at GBP 12,568 per
LYLAH gained (2 trials provided data on LYLAH and 17 trials
provided data on resource use; low-certainty evidence) (Table 3).
The probabilitythatCGA wouldbe cost-effective ata GBP 20,000
ceiling ratio (which is the GBP 20,000 threshold suggested by the
National Institute for Health and Care Excellence for QALY, LY,
and LYLAH was 0.50, 0.89, and 0.47, respectively (17 trials; low-
certainty evidence) (NICE 2013).
We addressed uncertainty by performing 10,000 draws of all incre-
mental costs and incremental health outcome parameters; CGA
was more costly in 89% of 10,000 generated incremental cost-
effectiveness ratios (ICERs) and led to QALY gains in 66% of
cases, LY gains in 87% of cases, and LYLAH gains in 74% of cases.
When effectiveness is measured in LYs gained, the probability that
CGA will be cost-effective is above 90% when the ceiling ratio
is increased to GBP 25,000 or higher (Figure 7). However, the
probability that CGA will be considered cost-effective is 68% and
72% for QALY and LYLAH gained, respectively, at a ceiling ratio
of GBP 75,000 (Figure 7). We have plotted in Figure 8, Figure 9,
and Figure 10 the distribution of each draw of all incremental cost
and incremental health outcome parameters and have displayed
the uncertainty in estimated ICERs (Appendix 2).

Activities of daily living (ADLs)
CGA probably leads to little or no difference in ADLs (SMD 0.04,
95% CI -0.06 to 0.15; 7 trials; 1445 participants (10% of the
total number of participants); moderate-certainty evidence; I² =
0%) (Applegate 1990; Goldberg 2013; Nikolaus 1999; Nikolaus
1999 plus ESD; Somme 2010; Thomas 1993; Winograd 1993).
See Analysis 1.8.
Re-admission
CGA results in little or no difference in re-admission to hospital
(RR 1.02, 95% CI 0.94 to 1.11; 13 trials; 6698 participants (49%
of the total number of participants); high-certainty evidence; low
heterogeneity; I² =0%) (Asplund 2000; Barnes 2012; Counsell
2000; Edmans 2013; Goldberg 2013; Kircher 2007; Landefeld

Results from meta-regression
CGA delivery on wards or by teams
Differences in effectiveness of CGA delivery between wards and
teams on living at home were uncertain, as this analysis was un-
derpowered (at discharge: F = 1.91, P = 0.20, N = 8 trials ward,
N = 3 trials team; end of follow-up (3 to 12 months): F = 3.54, P
= 0.08, N = 12 trials ward, N = 4 trials team).
Age or frailty as a criterion for targeting delivery of CGA
Differences in effectiveness between age and frailty as a criterion
for targeting CGA delivery on living at home were uncertain (at
discharge: F = 0.18, P = 0.68, N = 7 trials age, N = 4 trials frailty;
end of follow-up (3 to 12 months): F = 0.98, P = 0.34, N = 5 trials
age, N = 11 trials frailty).
Timing of admission from emergency department (direct or
stepdown)
Differences in effectiveness of CGA delivery between direct and
stepdown admission from emergency department on living at
home were uncertain (at discharge: F = 0.51, P = 0.49, N = 6 trials
direct, N = 4 trials stepdown; end of follow-up (3 to 12 months):
F = 0.45, P = 0.51, N = 4 trials direct, N = 7 trials stepdown).

 Outpatient follow-up
Differences in effectiveness of CGA delivery between outpatient
follow-up and no outpatient follow-up on living at home were
uncertain (at end of follow-up: F = 0.17, P = 0.69, N = 5 trials
outpatient follow-up, N = 7 trials no outpatient follow-up).
Subgroup analysis using IPD
Results of subgroup analysis using IPD indicate that in the five
trials providing IPD (1692 participants (12% of the total num-
ber of participants); adjusted for age, sex, and frailty) there was
little or no difference in the odds of living at home at the end
of follow-up for participants in the intervention group versus the
control group (odds ratio (OR) 0.95, 95% CI 0.74 to 1.24; I² =
0%; Edmans 2013; Goldberg 2013; Kircher 2007; Somme 2010;
Saltvedt 2002) (Table 4; Table 5; Table 6). Similarly, results on
mortality indicate little or no difference in the odds of mortality
at end of follow-up (OR 0.92, 95% CI 0.70 to 1.21; I² = 0%).
Time-to-event meta-analysis allowed for the possibility that each
trial may have a different baseline hazard function; results show
little or no difference in the time to death (hazard ratio (HR) 0.88,
95% CI 0.72 to 1.08) (Appendix 3).
Sensitivity analysis
Re-running analyses using random-effects rather than fixed-effect
models had little effect on associations between intervention and
primary or secondary outcome measures (data not shown). Re-
running the analysis while excluding trials that did not omit nurs-
ing home admissions at baseline had little effect on associations
between intervention and admission to a nursing home at 3 to 12
months’ follow-up (data not shown). Also, re-running the analysis
for living at home at 3 to 12 months’ follow-up by using data from
6 months’ rather than from 12 months’ follow-up for three trials
that reported both lengths of follow-up, had little effect on the
association (data not shown). CGA became more cost-effective
when incremental QALYs for a more dependent population were
calculated on the basis of data from two trials (Goldberg 2013;
Somme 2010). We also calculated cost per LYLAH gained using
the summary estimate for living at home that was derived from
trials evaluating CGA delivered on a specialist ward and by a mo-
bile team. We found that CGA delivered on a specialist ward is
slightly more cost-effective.

Summary of main results
See Summary of findings for the main comparison
We included 29 randomised trials evaluating the effectiveness of
comprehensive geriatric assessment (CGA) versus inpatient care
without CGA. Older people admitted to hospital who receive
CGA may be more likely to survive and return home (16 trials,
6799 participants) and were less likely to be admitted to a nursing
home during 3 to 12 months’ follow-up (14 trials, 6285 partici-
pants). We are uncertain whether results show a difference in effect
between wards and teams, as this analysis was underpowered. Ev-
idence for the cost-effectiveness analysis is of low-certainty owing
to imprecision and inconsistency among studies.
Overall completeness and applicability of
evidence
The included trials were published between 1984 and 2013, and
were conducted in nine countries - most (16 trials) in the USA.
Delivery of healthcare services and the role of the CGA will in-
evitably have evolved during this period. Despite this, CGA has
maintained a central position in delivery of person-centred health
care for older people with frailty. Findings from the survey of trial-
ists suggest more commonalities than differences in the way CGA
is organised and delivered but some variation in the way the in-
tervention was implemented. In one trial (Goldberg 2013), the
CGA ward was a specialist medical and mental health unit, and in
another (Edmans 2013), the intervention consisted of case man-
agement by a geriatrician at the point of discharge. In most trials,
the control group received care on the general medical ward, and
in two trials (Goldberg 2013; Kircher 2007), control group care
could include a dedicated ward for older people. Social care costs,
which were relevant to evaluation of CGA, were not included in
the cost-effectiveness analysis because of lack of reliable data. Ap-
plying these findings to other settings would require re-estima-
tion of the model based on context-specific unit costs and utilities
(Shemilt 2011).
Certainty of evidence
We judged the certainty of evidence as high for the outcome ’liv-
ing at home’ and for mortality, admission to a nursing home, and
dependency. Overall risk of bias was low, and trials showed consis-
tency, except in cognitive function and hospital length of stay. A
limitation of this review is that we received individual patient data
(IPD)from only 5 of 29 trials, hence this subgroup analysis was not
representative of the 29 included trials. We judged the certainty
of evidence to be low for the cost-effectiveness analysis owing to
imprecision and inconsistency. We derived outcomes in the cost-
effectiveness analysis from five trials providing IPD, and we based
hospitalisation costs on data from 17 trials reporting length of stay
data and providing low-certainty evidence. We based the cost of
CGA delivery on one trial and found no data for social care costs.
The effect of CGA delivered by teams is uncertain, and subgroup
analysis of the effect of ward-delivered versus team-delivered CGA
was underpowered (Appendix 4).

 Potential biases in the review process
We limited publication bias by conducting an extensive search that
included different databases of published articles and sources of
unpublished literature. One review author screened all search re-
sults and generated a long list (using an overly inclusive approach),
from which two review authors independently selected eligible
studies.
Agreements and disagreements with other
studies or reviews
The findings of this review are consistent with those of the first
systematic review on CGA (Stuck 1993); this review reported that
CGA increased the likelihood that patients will be living at home
at follow-up, and that control over medical recommendations and
extended outpatient follow-up were likely to improve health out-
comes. Subsequently, several published systematic reviews pro-
vided consistent findings (Bachmann 2010; Baztan 2009; Ellis
2005; Van Craen 2010). A review of CGA assessment performed
to improve outcomes for frail older people who were rapidly dis-
charged from acute hospital care (up to 72 hours) included five
trials (2287 participants) and found little evidence of benefit for
this type of CGA intervention in terms of mortality, institutionali-
sation, re-admission, functional outcomes, quality of life, and cog-
nition (Conroy 2011). Another systematic review looked at effects
of hospital-wide interventions (CGA wards, CGA teams, nursing
care models, and structural changes in physical environment) pro-
vided to improve care for frail older patients and did not identify
a single best hospital-wide intervention (Bakker 2011). Large un-
certainty surrounding cost-effectiveness results is consistent with
trial-based economic evaluation (Melis 2008; Tanajewski 2015).

Implications for practice
Comprehensive geriatric assessment offers benefit for the increas-
ing numbers of older people with frailty admitted to inpatient
care. Most trials have evaluated CGA on a discrete ward. Although
it has been suggested that having control over implementing rec-
ommendations of the multi-disciplinary team in a ward setting
is likely to increase success, the number of trials in the subgroup
of trials evaluating CGA teams were insufficient to confirm a dif-
ference of effect. We conducted a survey of trialists to attempt to
identify the elements of CGA that are considered important; 13 of
the 29 trialists completed the survey, and 10 to 13 of these agreed
that critical elements of CGA include tailored treatment plans,
clinical leadership, knowledge and experience, multi-disciplinary
team meetings, and involvement of patients and carers in goal set-
ting. We found that CGA may be slightly more costly to the health
service than usual care without CGA. However, our analysis did
not include the cost of home or social care. CGA may be cost-
effective, although with low certainty of evidence, and further re-
search that reports cost estimates that are setting-specific across
different sectors of care are required.
Implications for research
Questions remain over effects of delays to specialist geriatric care,
benefits of targeting CGA to older adults with frailty, effects
of CGA wards versus teams, and cost-effectiveness. Future trials
should provide a clear description of the elements of the geriatric
intervention, and should make individual participant data avail-
able for subsequent meta-analysis. We recommend standardised
outcome assessments for these trials. We developed the outcome
measurement ’life year living at home’ as an indicator of inde-
pendence and well-being. This outcome aligns with the primary
outcome used in this review. Further research conducted to test
the robustness of the LYLAH and use of alternative methods for
valuing outcomes of interventions in older people would be ben-
eficial.

Location: USA (VA multi-centre study)
Team/ward?: ward ± outpatient follow-up
Timing: stepdown
Trial method: randomised trial, 2 × 2 factorial design comparing inpatient geriatric
evaluation and management unit ward vs usual care, followed by outpatient care in a
geriatric clinic vs usual outpatient care
This is the subgroup of the trial that evaluated Geriatric Evaluation and Management
Clinic (GEMC) follow-up post discharge from inpatient care. This splitting of data has
been done to enable meta-analysis for the outpatient follow-up subgroup
Participants
Number (total): 1388
Mean age: 74 years
Male:female proportion: 98% male
Inclusion criteria: age ≥ 65; hospitalised on a medical ward; expected length of stay >
2 days; frailty (presence of stroke, history of falls, inability to perform ADLs, prolonged
bed rest, incontinence)
Exclusion criteria: admission from nursing home; terminal illness
Interventions
Team members: senior geriatrician, specialist nurse, social workers, physiotherapists,
occupational therapists, dieticians, pharmacists
Team organisation: comprehensive assessment, at least weekly MDT meeting
Control: Inpatients assigned to receive usual care received all appropriate hospital ser-
vices except those provided by the team on the geriatric evaluation and management
unit. Outpatients assigned to receive usual care were provided with at least 1 follow-up
appointment in an appropriate clinic
Outcomes
Death
Perceived health status
Basic and extended ADLs
Costs
Trial conclusions: no overall effects on survival, improved physical function with inpa-
tient care, improved cognitive function with outpatient care

Tanajewski et al. 2015, AMIGOS trial
Mean difference in QALY was based on mapping the IPD for the Barthel from three trials (Edmans 2013; Kircher 2007; Saltvedt
2002).
In Saltvedt 2002, baseline Barthel Index was assessed 1.7 days after inclusion in the control group and at 3.5 days in the intervention
group.
In Saltvedt 2002, baseline Barthel Index was self-reported in the control group and was performance-based in the intervention group.

comprehensive geriatric assessment
Appendix 2. Methods used in the cost-effectiveness analysis
The aim of the cost-effectiveness analysis was to examine whether health outcomes and costs differ between those who received inpatient
CGA and those admitted to hospital but did not receive CGA.
Costs
An NHS perspective was taken, as suggested in the NICE guidance for health economic evaluations (NICE 2013). We included
hospitalisation costs and the costs of delivering CGA. Hospitalisation costs were based on the meta-analysis of mean length of stay in
hospital (N = 17 studies) (Analysis 1.10) and were valued using English unit cost prices 2013/2014. The unit cost of a hospital bed day
was calculated as the weighted average cost of elective and non-elective hospital admissions reported in the National Reference Costs
2013/14. Costs of delivering CGA per patient were based on data reported in one trial (Primary AMIGOS Trial, Edmans 2013; cost-
effectiveness study, Tanajewski 2015), which evaluated a version of CGA that included an attending geriatrician and outpatient follow-
up.
Outcomes
The effectiveness of delivering inpatient CGA was measured by three health outcomes:
• Quality-adjusted life years (QALYs) were calculated using individual patient data (IPD) from three trials that assessed patient
functioning/dependency with the the Barthel Index (Edmans 2013; Kircher 2007; Saltvedt 2002). We converted the Barthel Index to
EQ-5D-3L UK utilities, based on methods described by Kaambwa 2013, to calculate QALYs. We selected studies with mean Barthel
scores at baseline that were similar to the population in the Kaambwa 2013 study (Barthel score range from 14.8 to 16.5, on a scale
of 0 to 20). We used the IPD provided by Edmans 2013 to validate the mapping exercise, by comparing the QALYs calculated using
the Bartel Index to QALYs based on EQ-5D -3L using IPD from Edmans 2013, as this study provided data for the EQ-5D and
the Barthel Index. A meta-analysis using a fixed-effect model was performed to estimate incremental QALYs (results are presented in
Supplementary Table 4.1 (see below).

• Life years (LYs) were estimated using the IPD from four trials to calculate time to death (TTD) from randomisation in each trial arm
(Edmans 2013; Goldberg 2013; Kircher 2007; Saltvedt 2002). A meta-analysis using a fixed-effect model was performed to estimate
the pooled mean difference in TTD between patients who had received CGA and those who had not. Results of the meta-analysis are
presented in Supplementary Table 4.2. The pooled mean difference in TTD was then divided by 365 (days in a year) to calculate LYs.

• We developed a health outcome, ’life years living at home’ (LYLAHs) after discharge from hospital, as a measure of independence and
well-being in an older population. LYLAHs were calculated from the IPD from two trials (Edmans 2013; Goldberg 2013) by dividing
the days living at home after hospital discharge for these two study populations by the study follow-up period. A meta-analysis using a
fixed-effect model was performed to estimate incremental LYLAHs. Results are presented in Supplementary Table 4.3.

Cost-effectiveness
A decision model was constructed in Excel to calculate the incremental cost-effectiveness ratio (ICER) of inpatient CGA compared
with inpatient care without CGA. The ICER was expressed as cost per QALY, cost per LY gained, and cost per LYLAH gained from the
NHS perspective (i.e. including only hospitalisation costs and costs of CGA delivery). The model was constructed to perform Monte
Carlo simulations based on predefined distributions of input parameters. The model incorporates information from hospital discharge
to the end of each trial’s follow-up period or death of patient (whichever comes first) and follows the patient’s pathway in terms of
residence during follow-up.
The summary estimate for the main outcome living at home at the end of follow-up of 3 to 12 months (RR 1.07, 95% CI 1.03 to
1.12) (Analysis 1.2) was used in the decision model. The RR was multiplied by the incremental LYLAH to adjust LYLAH with the
probability of living at home. We did not do this for life years gained, as the summary estimate (Analysis 1.4) (RR being dead at the
end of the follow-up period) was 1, and it would not be appropriate to adjust life years by the probability of death. Input parameters
used in these models are presented in Table 2. Uncertainty about input parameters of the model was addressed by performing 10,000
draws of all incremental cost and incremental health outcome parameters using prespecified distributions and recording incremental
costs, incremental QALYs, incremental LYs, and incremental LYLAHs from each draw. These results were plotted on cost-effectiveness
planes and cost-effectiveness acceptability curves to display uncertainty in the estimated ICERs.
Sensitivity analysis
Two univariate sensitivity analyses were performed for the cost-effectiveness analysis. In the first, we calculated incremental QALYs for
a more dependent population (mean Barthel Index of 9 at baseline) (Goldberg 2013; Somme 2010). In this sensitivity analysis, EQ-
5D-3L utilities were mapped to the Barthel Index using a formula provided in van Exel 2004; which was based on a more dependent
population of older people who were recovering from a stroke (also mean Barthel Index of 9 at baseline). A meta-analysis using a fixed-
effect model was performed to estimate (pooled) incremental QALYs based on the two trials. Results of this analysis are presented in
Supplementary Table 4.4.

In the second univariate sensitivity analysis, we used the summary estimate (Analysis 1.2.1) for delivering CGA only on a dedicated
ward (i.e. excluding CGA delivered by teams across wards) for the outcome living at home at the end of follow-up.
Appendix 3. Individual participant data analysis details
1) There were two randomisation groups in the Kircher dataset and one non-randomised external comparison group. The comparison
group was not used in our review.
2) There were three participants in the Kircher dataset with time to death recorded after follow-up. Of these three participants, one
was in the ‘comparison’ group and therefore not included in our analysis. For the other two, their status was updated to ‘alive’ for the
analysis.
3) There were two participants in Kircher with typos in the recording of date of death. These were treated as missing dates in the
analysis.

GE conceived and wrote the original review and provided a clinical perspective, co-wrote and commented on drafts of the review, and
is a co-applicant on the NIHR grant (12/5003//01; “How to Implement Cost-Effective Comprehensive Geriatric Assessment”) that
supported this review update.
MG led the update of the review, read through titles and abstracts to identify studies for inclusion, extracted data from the included
studies, and contacted study authors for clarification and trialists to invite them to contribute their trial data and complete a survey.
MG set up the IPD database and cleaned the incoming data. MG updated the assessment of risk of bias of all 29 studies included in
the review, and produced the first draft for comment by coauthors.
OB, MG, AT, and SS wrote a detailed statistical plan of analysis for this update, which was peer reviewed. OB conducted statistical
analysis using IPD; MG conducted statistical analysis using published data for the meta-regression; and AT conducted the cost-
effectiveness analysis.
MG and GE agreed on studies for inclusion and extracted data.
MG, GE, and SS selected main outcomes, graded the certainty of evidence, and contacted trialists to invite them to join the review
group and contribute their trial data.
MG and SS generated the ’Summary of findings’ table.
SS is the CI for the NIHR grant (12/5003//01; “How to Implement Cost-Effective Comprehensive Geriatric Assessment”) that funded
the update of this review via IPD, a survey of trialists, and a cost-effectiveness analysis; she supervised the analysis, worked with MG
to produce the first draft of the update, revised subsequent drafts, and is the guarantor.
DS, HW, IS, RH, SC, and TK provided IPD and commented on a draft of the updated review.

In the previous version of the review (Ellis 2011), review authors used the odds ratio as a summary estimate; owing to the high number
of events, we have used the risk ratio in this update. We have accessed individual patient data (IPD; five studies) and have obtained
from the trialists additional details of delivery of the intervention. This has allowed us to estimate the cost-effectiveness of delivering
CGA.
For this update, MA Whitehead is no longer a co-review author. New review authors include Mike Gardner, Apostolos Tsiachristas,
Orlaith Burke, Heidi Wald, Rowan Harwood, Tilo Kircher, Dominique Somme, Ingvild Saltvedt, Simon Conroy, and Sasha Shepperd.
