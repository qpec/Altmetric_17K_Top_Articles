ABSTRACT 
Aims: To estimate prevalence of excess intake of acetaminophen, and investigate seasonal 
variations therein.  
Methods:  Between 2011 and 2016, 14,481 US adults who used acetaminophen in the 
preceding 30 days were sampled from national online panels and completed a detailed online 
daily diary of acetaminophen medication use for 7 days.  Respondents were not told the study 
concerned acetaminophen.  Cold/flu season (CFS), identified using Google© Trends data, was 
contrasted to off-season in symptoms, use of acetaminophen medications, and consumption 
exceeding 4 grams (the recommended daily maximum).   
Results:  Overall, 6.3% [95% CI: 6.0%-6.6%] of users exceeded 4 grams on at least one day; 
3.7% [3.5%-3.9%] of usage days exceeded 4 grams. Cold/flu symptoms were more likely to 
be experienced and treated with acetaminophen in CFS than off-season. Acetaminophen users 
were more likely to exceed 4 grams during CFS (6.5% vs 5.3%; OR= 1.24, 1.04-1.48); days 
exceeding 4 grams also increased (3.9% vs 2.8%; OR= 1.37, 1.11-1.69).  This was not due to 
differences in characteristics of individuals using acetaminophen in CFS, but primarily to 
increased use of over-the-counter (OTC) combination medications designed to treat upper 
respiratory cold/flu symptoms (33.2% of usage days in CFS vs 24.8% in off-season; OR=1.6, 
1.5-1.7).  When such medications were omitted, there was no statistically significant seasonal 
variation in exceeding 4 grams. 
Conclusions:  Acetaminophen use and over-dosing increases in CFS, primarily due to 
increased use of OTC combinations treating upper respiratory cold/flu symptoms.  
Pharmacists should warn users to follow labeled dosing directions, especially during CFS.

What is known about this subject 
• 
Acetaminophen is an active ingredient in many prescription and over-the-counter 
(OTC)  
medications. 
• 
When taken in high doses, acetaminophen can cause liver injury. 
• 
Users sometimes exceed the maximum recommended dose of 4 grams per day. 
 
What this study adds 
• 
Over the course of 7 days, 6.3% of acetaminophen users exceed 4 grams on at least 
one day. 
• 
Such over-dose occurred more often in cold-flu season (6.5%) than in off-season 
(5.3%), due to increased use of OTC combinations treating upper-respiratory cold/flu 
symptoms.  
 
1 INTRODUCTION 
Acetaminophen is an active ingredient present in hundreds of over-the-counter (OTC) and 
prescription (Rx) medications indicated for pain and fever as well as in many multi-
ingredient OTC medications additionally indicated for symptoms associated with colds, flu, 
allergies, and sleeplessness [1]. It is considered safe when dosed as directed, but, in overdose, 
has been associated with liver injury [1], and with calls to poison control centers (estimated 
around 112,000/year), emergency room visits (59,000/year), and hospitalizations 
(38,000/year) [2-4].  Many acetaminophen over-doses are the result of deliberate self-harm, 
but a substantial proportion are attributed to unintentional over-dose; for example, 30% of 
acetaminophen-related emergency room visits are attributed to unintentional over-dose.  The 
problem of unintentional over-dosing has been of sufficient concern for the US Food and 
Drug Administration (FDA) to convene an Advisory Committee [5, 6] on the subject in 2009.   
 
The current maximum recommended daily adult dose of acetaminophen is 4 grams [8].  In 
most instances, acetaminophen-related liver injury only occurs at considerably higher doses, 
thus limiting ingestion to 4 grams would prevent injuries.  Reports of retrospective 
assessments with small, select samples, such as emergency room patients [9] or dental clinic 
patients [10], suggest that acetaminophen users periodically exceed the recommended daily 
dose in those settings.  However, detailed prospective data on patterns of self-treatment with

acetaminophen in the general population have until recently been lacking.  We previously 
reported results from 7-day medication diaries collected from acetaminophen users during a 
single month (August 2010), estimating that the 4-gram daily limit was exceeded by 4.5% of 
acetaminophen users  and on 3.1% of acetaminophen usage days [12].  Analyses identified 
personal characteristics (e.g., chronic pain and smoking) and attitudes (e.g., that label 
directions are just suggestions), and usage patterns (e.g., concomitant use of multiple 
acetaminophen medications, including a mix of single-ingredient and combination 
medications) associated with exceeding the limit [11, 12].   
 
One limitation of those results was that the data were collected during a single month in the 
summer, and so may not have optimally estimated the likelihood of exceeding the 
recommended maximum dose.  Moreover, these data would not have captured seasonal 
influences on acetaminophen use.  Since many OTC combination medications are intended to 
treat the upper respiratory symptoms of cold and flu (designated "upper respitatory" 
medications), it seems plausible that utilization of upper respiratory medications would rise 
during the cold-flu season, perhaps leading to an increase in exceeding 4 grams.  The present 
analyses estimate the prevalence of over-dosing and assess seasonal variations in over-
dosing. 
 
2 METHODS 
The study used the data-collection methods described in detail in our previous publications 
[11, 12], but this is a new, non-overlapping sample, collected between 03/07/2011 and 
03/31/2016.   The study was ruled exempt by the Boston University Medical Campus 
Institutional Review Board.   
 
2.1 Participants  
 
Respondents were US volunteers aged ≥18 sampled from multiple online research panels 
(Lightspeed Research, GMI, Survey Sampling International) who responded to emails 
inviting them to participate in the study, in return for compensation.  Nothing in the 
invitations or any other communication indicated that the study concerned acetaminophen.  
The selection of panel members to be invited was adjusted as needed to the distribution of the

US population, based on region, age, income, gender, and race/ethnicity.  Participants were 
restricted to those who reported using an acetaminophen medication in the past 30 days, to 
increase the proportion who were likely to use acetaminophen during the subsequent 7-day 
diary period.   
 
A total of 980,415 invitations was sent (it is not known how many were received or viewed), 
168,016 persons visited the enrollment website, 48,803 qualified, and 18,689 completed 7 
days of diaries and an exit survey.  The median age of participants was 44; 61% were female 
and 24% non-white; 46% reported income below $50,000; and 82% had education beyond 
high school.   
 
2.2 Data collection 
 
After enrolling, respondents were prompted by email daily for 7 consecutive days to 
complete an on-line diary of medication use. Each day after 3 pm, they recorded medications 
they had taken in the past 24 hours (they were also allowed to fill in the previous day’s use if 
missed), indicating how much they had taken and when, using a grid of hours that began at 
the time they completed the previous diary. To identify medications, respondents selected 
from a comprehensive list of acetaminophen-containing medications organized in a 
hierarchical structure by indication (pain/fever, cold/flu/sinus, allergy), class (OTC vs Rx), 
and brand or product name (the list grew over time from 384 to 423 products, as new 
products became available).  Respondents were not told that the list was limited to 
acetaminophen-containing medications. To reduce the burden of finding their medications for 
each diary entry, participants selected from their personal list of medications on hand, to 
which they could add at any time. After the week of diary-keeping, participants completed an 
exit survey that assessed demographic characteristics, medication knowledge, exposure to 
products and product messaging, attitudes and some medical history.  The diary and survey 
were developed by the authors and extensively pre-tested, both through qualitative methods 
and through collection of pilot quantitative data.

2.3 Definition of key variables 
 
Analyses focused on days of use (midnight to midnight) when dosing exceeded 4 grams.  
Each time respondents reported taking a medication, they reported the product and how many 
units (e.g., tablets) they took, which enabled us to compute the daily dose.  Within OTC 
combinations, we distinguished the medications intended (based on names and labeling) to 
treat upper respiratory symptoms ("upper respiratory" medications) from those designed to 
relieve other symptoms.  For each dosing occasion, respondents were also asked to indicate 
what symptom or condition they were treating, selecting a primary and (optionally) a 
secondary target symptom from a list that included pain, fever, cold/flu, sinus, allergy, sleep, 
and other. 
 
2.4 Seasonality 
 
To estimate seasonal variations in colds and flu, we used Google Trends© [13] to analyze 
searches performed across the continental US during the data collection periodsi.  Analyses of 
Google© searches have been used by epidemiologists to quantify the ebb and flow of various 
disease states [14, 15], and have been validated as indicators of seasonal variations in flu [16-
18].  We also validated the Google© data against data on weekly purchase of all OTC 
medications classified as cough/cold/sinus medications (not limited to acetaminophen 
medications), obtained from IMS (Danbury, CT), for the 242 weeks from January 2009 to 
August 2013.  The Google© search data correlated 0.93 with the IMS data.  The weekly 
search data were used to identify periods as being in the cold/flu season (CFS) or in the off 
season (OFFS), and these periods were contrasted in subsequent analyses.  The seasonality 
curves also identified transitional periods between CFS and OFFS, when cold/flu searches 
were initially rising or falling; these periods were omitted from the analysis, as data were 
sparse and variable, precluding clear interpretation.  While dates varied from year to year, 
CFS lasted roughly from September/October to March/April, while OFFS lasted from June to 
late August. 
 
                                                          
 
i The search terms used were [flu + influenza + "head cold" - + "chest cold" - + "sore throat" - 
+ "stuffy nose" - + "runny nose" - + sneeze + sneezing - vaccine -shot –avian], where "-" 
indicates terms to be excluded.

2.5 Analysis 
 
We estimated the percentage of acetaminophen users who exceeded 4 grams or 8 grams on at 
least one day and the percentage of usage days on which 4 grams or 8 grams was exceeded.  
The number of invitations per day varied over the course of the study; to account for this, and 
any confounding with seasonality, we weighted the data to even out the invitation rate. As 
reported below, this did not materially affect the outcome. 
 
Analyses examining dosing occasions or days accounted for the nesting of observations 
within persons by using Generalized Estimating Equations (GEE) [19] with the logit link 
function and an exchangeable covariance structure for dichotomous variables, and mixed 
linear models with compound symmetry for continuous variables.   
 
To assess whether seasonal differences in the profile of persons using acetaminophen might 
account for any differences in the likelihood of exceeding 4 grams, a multivariate model 
tested whether the variables which previous analyses [11] associated with exceeding the limit 
could differentiate CFS from OFFS users.  This was modeled by logistic regression with 
season as the dependent variable and subject characteristics, assessed in the exit survey, as 
predictors (education, ongoing or chronic pain, daily smoking, 10 or more past-year medical 
visits, SF-12 physical component score [20], and attitude scores indicating "I know what dose 
is right for me," and "I start at the lowest dose," which were derived by factor analysis of 
medication attitudes) [11].   
 
3 RESULTS 
 
3.1 Analytical samples 
 
Overall, 18,689 individuals completed 7 days of diaries and the exit survey. Of these, 14,481 
reported acetaminophen use on 59,220 usage days (out of 101,367 diary days), comprising 
122,854 dosing occasions; this was the dataset used in analyses estimating the overall 
probability of exceeding 4 grams.  Of the 14,481 users, 7,991 (55.2%) reported using 
acetaminophen on 4 or more diary days.

3.2 Overall rates of acetaminophen over-dosing 
 
As shown in Table 1, across all seasons (including transitional periods), 6.3% [95% CI: 
5.9%-6.7%] of users exceeded 4 grams on one or more days, and on 3.7%  [3.5%-3.8%] of 
usage days; 8 grams was exceeded by 1.2% [1.0%-1.4%] of users, on 0.7% [0.6%-0.7%] of 
usage days.  Very few users (1.4% [1.2%-1.6%]) exceeded 4 grams on 4 or more diary days 
and only 0.2% [0.2%-0.3%] exceeded 8 grams 4 or more diary days.  Estimates based on data 
weighted to account for variations in the number of invitations issued were nearly identical to 
the unweighted estimates for both 4 grams (person: 6.4%; day: 3.7%) and 8 grams (person: 
1.2%; day: 0.6%); unweighted data were used for remaining analyses. 
 
3.3 Seasonal variations in symptoms and treatment 
 
Participants' daily reports of symptoms they experienced (supplemental Appendix 1) showed 
the expected seasonal variation: Cold/flu symptoms, fever, and sinus symptoms were 
reported more often in CFS.  The proportion of acetaminophen dosing occasions intended to 
treat cold/flu, fever, and sinus symptoms also increased in CFS (supplemental Appendix 2).   
 
3.4 Seasonal variations in use and excess dosing of acetaminophen 
Analyses of seasonal patterns were based on data from CFS (9,255 users, 64,785 diary days, 
38,136 usage days, 80,229 dosing occasions) and OFFS (3,271 users, 22,897 diary days, 
13,121 usage days, 25,959 dosing occasions).  The number of days of acetaminophen use was 
very slightly higher in CFS (4.12 usage days per user) compared to OFFS (4.01; p=0.014). 
 
As shown in Table 2, on acetaminophen usage days, the total dose was more likely to exceed 
4 grams in CFS than in OFFS, both when considering individual days and when considering 
the likelihood that individuals had at least one day exceeding 4 grams.  On a relative basis, 
compared to OFFS, the odds of a user exceeding 4 grams on at least one day were 24% 
higher during CFS, and the odds of exceeding 4 grams on an acetaminophen usage day 
increased almost 40%.  Similarly, in CFS, the odds of exceeding 4 grams on 4 or more diary 
days are increased by 82% (1.5% vs 0.9%; OR: 1.82, 1.21 – 2.73).  Numerically, there was a 
similar seasonal  effect on exceeding 8 grams (Table 2), but the effect was not statistically

significant, likely due to the very low rates.  There was no increase in exceeding 8 grams on 4 
or more days in CFS (0.2% in both CFS and OFFS, OR: 0.93 (0.41 – 2.10)). 
 
3.5 Do user characteristics vary by season? 
 
One possible explanation for seasonal variations in exceeding 4 grams could be that the 
individuals who use acetaminophen during CFS differ from those using in OFFS in ways that 
increase their likelihood of exceeding 4 grams. To test this, we compared users in CFS and 
OFFS on characteristics previously shown to be associated with exceeding 4 grams [11].  In a 
multivariate model, users of acetaminophen in CFS did not differ significantly from users 
during OFFS in any of these characteristics (supplemental Appendix 3). 
 
3.6 Seasonal variations in patterns of acetaminophen use 
 
The types of acetaminophen medications used varied by season (Table 3).  The proportion of 
days on which OTC combination medications were used – either alone or along with single-
ingredient medications - increased (ORs 1.2-1.3).  Among the OTC combinations, only those 
classified as upper respiratory medications increased in CFS (OR=1.6), while the use of 
allergy medications declined (OR=0.8).  The use of OTC combination sleep and pain 
medications was unchanged. Conversely, days in which only Rx medications were used 
declined in CFS (OR=0.9), as did the proportion of days on which only single-ingredient 
OTC medications were taken (OR=0.8).  
 
To better understand seasonal increases in the use of upper respiratory medications, we 
distinguished the sole use of these medications on a given day from use along with other 
acetaminophen medications within the same day.  In both CFS and OFFS, on two thirds of 
days when upper respiratory medications were used, they were the only acetaminophen 
medications used.  Both patterns of upper respiratory medication use increased in CFS:  The 
odds that a usage day included use of both upper respiratory medications and other 
acetaminophen medications increased by 30% in CFS (Table 3), and the odds that upper 
respiratory medications were used alone increased even more steeply by 60%.

The observed increases in usage of upper respiratory medications during CFS suggest that 
usage of these medications could account for seasonal increases in the likelihood of 
exceeding 4 grams.  To assess this hypothesis, we re-computed daily acetaminophen intake 
while excluding intake from upper respiratory medications.  As shown in Table 2, this largely 
eliminated the seasonal increase in exceeding 4 grams during CFS (OR=1.1, ns, for both 
persons and days).  Further analysis showed that the seasonal increase in exceeding 4 grams 
was due both to days when upper respiratory medications were used exclusively and to days 
when they were used along with other medications (results not shown).   
 
4 DISCUSSION 
 
Using detailed diary data covering five years and over 14,000 acetaminophen users studied 
over 59,000 usage days, the present analyses showed that 6.3% of acetaminophen users 
exceeded the maximum daily dose on at least one day, with such over-dosing occurring on 
3.7% of acetaminophen usage days.  In a previous study with very similar methods, we 
reported lower prevalence of intake exceeding 4 grams: 4.5% of users [11] and 3.1% of usage 
days [12].  The previous study was based on data collected during a single summer month, 
whereas the current data cover five years of data encompassing seasonal variations and a 
longer time-frame. Thus, we regard the current estimates as more robust.   
 
Consistent with other studies [22-25], we focused on exceeding 4 grams a day as our primary 
outcome because this has been designated as the maximum daily dose by the Food and Drug 
Administration (FDA). This makes the 4-gram limit an apt target for consumer education; 
also, if users limited their intake to 4 grams a day, exposures to still higher doses would 
necessarily be avoided.  However, the dose that can cause liver injury is generally much 
higher than this, and likely varies with genetic and other factors [26]; repeated instances of 
excess dosing may also increase the risk. So, there is no implication that the study 
participants whose reported use exceeded 4 grams experienced any adverse medical 
consequences. We observed that exceeding 8 grams in a day was much less common, as was 
exceeding 4 grams on the majority of days (at least 4 out of 7).  Indeed, while we documented 
increased incidence of doses exceeding 4 grams on any one day, or on most days, during 
cold/flu season, the study lacked the power to show similar increases in dosing exceeding 8

grams per day, and Weinstein et al [27] found no seasonal increase in acetaminophen-related 
liver injury. 
 
It should be noted that there have been several initiatives that may over time reduce excess 
intake of acetaminophen.  Starting in 2014, the FDA limited the dose of acetaminophen in Rx 
acetaminophen-opiate combinations to 325 mg [28]. Further, both tighter prescribing 
restrictions on opiates [29] and a campaign against over-prescribing [30] have been fielded, 
out of concern for increasing overdose deaths, and prescribing is in fact declining [31]. A 
number of public-education campaigns promoting safe use of acetaminophen have also been 
mounted [32, 33].  Analyses of trends over time may give insight into whether these 
interventions have indeed reduced the likelihood of acetaminophen dosing exceeding the 
recommended daily limit of 4 grams. 
 
Our analyses also documented seasonal variation in use exceeding the 4-gram limit.  The 
absolute increases in exceeding 4 grams during the cold and flu season were modest – just 
over 1% of persons and days – but represented meaningful relative increases (24% for 
persons, 37% for usage days, and 67% for exceeding 4 grams on most days) over the off-
season rates.  The increases were almost entirely attributable to seasonal increases in the 
frequency of use of upper respiratory medications – OTC combination acetaminophen 
products used to treat upper respiratory cold and flu symptoms – which were more often 
reported during cold-flu season. Both days when only upper respiratory medications were 
used and days in which upper respiratory medications were used along with other 
acetaminophen medications contributed to the seasonal increase in likelihood of exceeding 
the daily maximum dose.    
 
In interpreting our reported rates of exceeding the daily 4 gram limit, it is important to note 
that they are not general-population rates: as in our previous analyses [11, 12], but unlike 
analyses in other studies [23-25], the rates are based on individuals who had used 
acetaminophen in the 30 days preceding the study, and who also used it during the week of 
diary-keeping. Thus, the present rates are based on a sample of relatively frequent users of 
acetaminophen, and likely over-estimate the overall population rates of exceeding 4 or 8 
grams acetaminophen in a day.  The screening for individuals who had used acetaminophen 
in the 30 days preceding the study may also have had differential effects during CFS, in that 
it would tend to exclude those who used acetaminophen only very sporadically, such as when

they suffer the occasional cold or flu, thus potentially under-estimating seasonal variation.  
Conversely, it is possible that sporadic users who take acetaminophen medications when they 
suffer seasonal illnesses might be more prone to use the medications to excess.   Note also 
that the daily rates of exceeding 4 grams do not reflect all days, as they are based on days 
when acetaminophen was used, leaving out more than half the total diary days.   
 
The findings suggest the need for public education campaigns to discourage acetaminophen 
dosing that exceeds the recommended maximum dose.  Previous findings [12] suggested a 
need to emphasize avoidance of concomitant use of multiple acetaminophen medications.   
Our findings suggest that public education campaigns might also include some emphasis on 
cold/flu season, addressing the use of upper respiratory medications to treat seasonal 
respiratory illnesses.   
 
A limitation of the study was its use of a sample recruited from internet research panels 
which may not be fully representative, particularly underrepresenting persons with low 
education and limited health literacy [11], who are may be more likely to exceed the 4-gram 
daily limit [34].  Response rates were low, which could have introduced non-response bias.  
The data are based on self-report, which is subject to a number of distortions.  The analyses 
relied on Google searches to identify cold-flu seasons. Search behavior may be influenced by 
factors besides actual disease incidence that affect consumer concern, but consumer concern 
may be critically important, since it influences medication-taking, perhaps even more so than 
objective measures of illness.  Our examination was limited to cold/flu season, and did not 
encompass other potential seasonal influences, such as allergy seasons, which may introduce 
geographic as well as seasonal variation.  As noted, our analyses were based on individuals 
who had used acetaminophen medications in the month preceding the study, so the sample 
likely over-represents regular users.  The behavior of more intermittent users may differ; in 
particular, they may have a lower likelihood of exceeding the daily 4-gram limit.  Finally, 
although exceeding the 4-gram limit is an important behavioral end-point, its relation to 
injury is not clear.  Use of 4 grams per day, even for extended periods, is generally well 
tolerated [35]; it is likely that higher doses over multiple days are necessary to produce liver 
injury [36].

The study also had several strengths. Definitions of cold/flu seasons were validated 
independently by market sales data and by participants’ reports of symptoms. The data were 
based on detailed diary reports, completed daily by a large national sample, covering five 
years.  Participants did not know the study concerned acetaminophen, and did not need to 
know which medications contained acetaminophen, nor was their attention drawn to seasonal 
effects, so self-reports would not be influenced by beliefs about acetaminophen or 
seasonality. Furthermore, with daily completion of the diary, the recall period was short and 
conducive to accurate reporting. Finally, the data were collected online, which is more likely 
to elicit truthful reporting [37].  
 
5 Conclusions 
 
We found that 6.3% of acetaminophen users exceeded the maximum recommended daily 
dose of acetaminophen at least once during a week in which they used acetaminophen, and 
1.4% exceeded this limit on the majority of days; the limit was exceeded on 3.7% of 
acetaminophen usage days.  This was somewhat more frequent during cold/flu season. The 
seasonal increase was mainly attributable to increases in the use of OTC acetaminophen 
medications containing a combination of ingredients designed to treat upper respiratory 
symptoms, in addition to treating pain and fever.  These findings suggest the need for 
consumer education about the proper use of acetaminophen medications, including limiting 
the dose to that specified in the medication directions, with some special emphasis during 
cold/flu season on limiting intake of medications treating upper-respiratory symptoms.
