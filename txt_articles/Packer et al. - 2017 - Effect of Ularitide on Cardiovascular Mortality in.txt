BACKGROUND
In patients with acute heart failure, early intervention with an intravenous vasodi-
lator has been proposed as a therapeutic goal to reduce cardiac-wall stress and, 
potentially, myocardial injury, thereby favorably affecting patients’ long-term prog-
nosis.
METHODS
In this double-blind trial, we randomly assigned 2157 patients with acute heart 
failure to receive a continuous intravenous infusion of either ularitide at a dose of 
15 ng per kilogram of body weight per minute or matching placebo for 48 hours, 
in addition to accepted therapy. Treatment was initiated a median of 6 hours after 
the initial clinical evaluation. The coprimary outcomes were death from cardiovas-
cular causes during a median follow-up of 15 months and a hierarchical composite 
end point that evaluated the initial 48-hour clinical course.
RESULTS
Death from cardiovascular causes occurred in 236 patients in the ularitide group 
and 225 patients in the placebo group (21.7% vs. 21.0%; hazard ratio, 1.03; 96% 
confidence interval, 0.85 to 1.25; P 
= 
0.75). In the intention-to-treat analysis, there 
was no significant between-group difference with respect to the hierarchical com-
posite outcome. The ularitide group had greater reductions in systolic blood pres-
sure and in levels of N-terminal pro–brain natriuretic peptide than the placebo 
group. However, changes in cardiac troponin T levels during the infusion did not 
differ between the two groups in the 55% of patients with paired data.
CONCLUSIONS
In patients with acute heart failure, ularitide exerted favorable physiological effects 
(without affecting cardiac troponin levels), but short-term treatment did not affect 
a clinical composite end point or reduce long-term cardiovascular mortality.

Effect of Ularitide in Acute Heart Failure
A
cute presentation with new-onset 
heart failure and rapid worsening of pre-
existing heart failure are two of the most 
common causes of hospitalization worldwide.1 
The disorder in each case is characterized by 
intravascular volume expansion and ventricular 
distention, which may cause myocardial injury 
in the absence of coronary artery disease or occlu-
sion.2-4 Episodes are associated with an accelerated 
rate of disease progression; each hospitalization 
for heart failure increases the risk of subsequent 
admissions as well as the risk of death from 
cardiovascular causes.5
The first few hours after the initial presentation 
with acute heart failure may represent a period 
of substantial myocardial vulnerability, which 
is characterized by rapid increases in cardiac-
wall stress.6 Patients with acute heart failure have 
elevated levels of N-terminal pro–brain natri-
uretic peptide (NT-proBNP) and cardiac tropo-
nin,2-4,6 thus mimicking features of an acute coro-
nary syndrome.7 These observations have led to 
the hypothesis that very early short-term inter-
ventions that attenuate cardiac-wall stress may 
reduce myocardial injury during a critical period 
and have favorable long-term effects (Fig. S1 in 
the Supplementary Appendix, available with the 
full text of this article at NEJM.org).8-12 Early 
vasodilator treatment has been proposed as a 
therapeutic goal in recent guidelines.13 Short-
term interventions have been associated with 
both favorable and unfavorable longer-term ef-
fects on morbidity and mortality.14-16
In the Trial of Ularitide Efficacy and Safety in 
Acute Heart Failure (TRUE-AHF), we examined 
whether the prompt administration of the natri-
uretic peptide ularitide in doses sufficient to 
reduce myocardial-wall stress would reduce the 
long-term risk of cardiovascular death in patients 
with acute heart failure.17 Ularitide, a chemically 
synthesized analogue of the naturally occurring 
vasodilator urodilatin, was selected as the study 
drug because it had been associated with hemo-
dynamic and clinical benefits in two previous 
randomized clinical trials.18,19
Methods
Trial Design and Oversight
TRUE-AHF was a randomized, double-blind, 
parallel-group, placebo-controlled, event-driven 
trial.17 The trial protocol and the statistical analy-
sis plan are available at NEJM.org. The ethics 
committee at each trial center approved the trial, 
and all the patients provided written informed 
consent.
The executive committee, together with the 
sponsor (Cardiorentis), developed and amended 
the protocol and oversaw the recruitment of 
patients and the analysis of data; the committee 
provided an independent interpretation of the 
results.17 A clinical-events committee classified 
deaths and adjudicated nonfatal events, and a 
medical review committee examined case sum-
maries for unidentified instances of in-hospital 
heart-failure events in a blinded manner. An in-
dependent data and safety monitoring commit-
tee reviewed the safety of the patients and the 
results of interim analyses. Data were analyzed 
according to a predefined statistical analysis 
plan, and an independent statistician verified and 
replicated the analyses. The first author, who 
had unrestricted access to the data, prepared the 
drafts of the manuscript, which were then re-
viewed and edited by all the authors, indepen-
dent of the sponsor. The authors assume respon-
sibility for the accuracy and completeness of the 
analyses; the last author attests to the fidelity of 
the trial to the protocol.
Patients
Men and women between the ages of 18 and 
85 years were eligible to enroll in the trial if they 
met all the following criteria: an unplanned emer-
gency department visit or hospitalization for 
acute heart failure, dyspnea at rest that had 
worsened during the previous week, evidence of 
heart failure on chest radiography, a blood BNP 
level of more than 500 pg per milliliter or an 
NT-proBNP level of more than 2000 pg per milli-
liter, and the possibility of initiating the study 
drug within 12 hours after the initial clinical 
evaluation. Patients who continued to have dys-
pnea at rest for at least 2 hours after the intra-
venous administration of at least 40 mg of furo-
semide (or the equivalent) and who had a 
systolic blood pressure between 116 mm Hg and 
180 mm Hg were eligible for randomization. (A 
full list of the exclusion criteria is provided in the 
Supplementary Appendix.)
Procedures
Patients underwent randomization in a 1:1 ratio 
in a double-blind manner to receive a continuous 
intravenous infusion of either ularitide at a dose 
of 15 ng per kilogram of body weight per minute

or matching placebo for 48 hours. This dose had 
produced meaningful decreases in cardiac fill-
ing pressures in previous trials.18,19 The rate of 
infusion of the study drug was reduced or dis-
continued if symptomatic hypotension developed 
or if there was a decrease in the systolic blood 
pressure to a value of less than 100 mm Hg or a 
decrease of more than 40 mm Hg from baseline.
Investigators used a patient global assess-
ment to inquire about changes in symptoms of 
heart failure at 6, 24, and 48 hours after the 
initiation of the study infusion (see the Supple-
mentary Appendix). Levels of NT-proBNP and 
high-sensitivity troponin T were assessed before 
the start of the infusion and after 48 hours. At 
48 hours, the study-drug infusion was stopped.
For the first 120 hours, patients were moni-
tored for persistent or worsening heart failure. 
The investigators described the features of these 
in-hospital heart-failure events and the interven-
tions that were used to treat them. (The defini-
tions that were used to identify and adjudicate 
these episodes are provided in the Supplementary 
Appendix.15,17) In addition, patients were allowed 
to receive any oral or intravenous medications 
for heart failure that were deemed to be clini-
cally appropriate. Patients were followed for the 
occurrence of rehospitalization for 6 months and 
for the occurrence of death for the entire dura-
tion of the trial.
Primary and Secondary Outcomes
The trial had two primary outcomes: cardiovas-
cular death over the entire duration of the trial 
and the clinical course of patients during the first 
48 hours, as assessed by a hierarchical clinical 
composite end point (Fig. 1, with additional de-
tails provided in the Supplementary Appendix).15,20 
When the trial was initiated, it focused only on 
the short-term clinical course of patients, and 
the clinical composite was the sole primary end 
point.17 However, after the Relaxin for the Treat-
ment of Acute Heart Failure (RELAX-AHF) trial 
reported a potential mortality reduction,14 we 
added cardiovascular mortality as a coprimary 
end point after approximately 40 patients had 
been enrolled and then redesigned the trial to 
extend follow-up to achieve a predetermined 
number of events. We divided the alpha level 
across the two primary end points, with 0.04 
assigned to cardiovascular mortality and 0.01 to 
the hierarchical clinical composite end point.
The secondary end points of the trial are sum-
marized in the Supplementary Appendix. These 
end points, which were to be tested hierarchi-
cally, included the length of stay in the hospital 
and in the intensive care unit during the index 
episode, the number of episodes of in-hospital 
heart-failure events through the first 120 hours, 
the proportion of patients with an in-hospital 
heart-failure event through the first 120 hours, 
rehospitalization for heart failure within 30 days 
after the initial hospital discharge, the time until 
completion of intravenous treatment for heart 
failure, and death or rehospitalization for a car-
diovascular cause during the first 180 days.
Figure 1. Hierarchical Clinical Composite End Point.
Each patient’s clinical course over the first 48 hours of the trial was classi-
fied as “worse,” “improved,” or “unchanged.” A patient’s condition was 
classified as worse if he or she died during the first 48 hours, had persis-
tent or worsening heart failure (as determined by the clinical-events com-
mittee in a blinded manner), or had moderate or marked worsening on a 
global assessment at any of the three time points of assessment (6, 24, or 
48 hours). A patient’s condition was classified as improved if he or she had 
moderate or marked improvement on a global assessment at all three time 
points and did not meet any of the criteria for worse condition. A patient’s 
condition was classified as unchanged if the criteria for worse and improved 
were not met. Details regarding the investigator determination of worsening 
heart failure and the patient global assessment are provided in the Supple-
mentary Appendix. Adapted with permission from Packer et al.17

Effect of Ularitide in Acute Heart Failure
Statistical Analysis
The sample size was based on the primary effi-
cacy analysis of cardiovascular mortality, which 
was tested at a two-sided significance level of 
0.04. We expected to recruit 2152 patients over a 
2-year period with a follow-up of at least 1 year to 
observe 652 deaths from cardiovascular causes, 
a trial design that provided a power of 90% to 
detect a relative reduction of 22% in the risk of 
cardiovascular death. These assumptions were 
based on a 6-month rate of cardiovascular death 
of 8.6% in the ularitide group and 11.0% in the 
placebo group. We evaluated time-to-event data 
with Kaplan–Meier estimates and used Cox pro-
portional-hazards models to calculate hazard 
ratios, 96% confidence intervals, and two-sided 
P values for the risk of cardiovascular death, 
using age, sex, baseline systolic blood pressure 
(<140 mm Hg vs. ≥140 mm Hg), time from the 
first clinical evaluation until the initiation of the 
study-drug infusion (≤6 hours vs. >6 hours), and 
region as prespecified covariates.
We performed the primary efficacy analysis 
for the hierarchical clinical composite end point 
at a two-sided significance level of 0.01. We used 
the Cochran–Mantel–Haenszel test to compare the 
differences in the distribution of ranks, with the 
time from the first physician evaluation until 
the initiation of the study-drug infusion and base-
line systolic blood pressure as stratification vari-
ables. All P values that were calculated for analy-
ses other than the primary end points are 
nominal (see the Supplementary Appendix).
We included data from all the patients who 
had undergone randomization in the analyses of 
the primary and secondary outcomes, according 
to the intention-to-treat principle, and used mul-
tiple imputation to account for missing data. 
The trial design incorporated an option to in-
crease the total enrollment on the basis of the 
results of a midpoint interim analysis; this op-
tion was not exercised. A second interim analy-
sis that was performed for futility after all the 
enrolled patients had been followed for at least 
6 months led to termination of the trial because 
no benefit was seen with respect to cardiovascu-
lar mortality.
Results
Patients
From August 2012 through May 2014, we enrolled 
2157 patients at 156 centers in 23 countries. A 
total of 1088 patients were assigned to receive 
ularitide and 1069 to receive placebo (Fig. S2 in 
the Supplementary Appendix). The characteris-
tics of the two groups were similar at baseline 
(Table 1, and Table S1 in the Supplementary Ap-
pendix).
Study-Drug Administration and Follow-up
We administered the study drug to 1072 patients 
in the ularitide group and 1056 in the placebo 
group at a median of 6.1 hours (interquartile 
range, 4.6 to 8.4) after the initial clinical evalu-
ation. (Reasons for nontreatment are provided in 
Fig. S2 in the Supplementary Appendix.) Ularitide 
was discontinued in 194 patients (18.1%) and 
placebo in 78 patients (7.4%); the dose was re-
duced (but not discontinued) in 106 patients (9.9%) 
in the ularitide group and in 55 (5.2%) in the 
placebo group (P<0.001 for both comparisons) 
(Table S2 in the Supplementary Appendix). The 
primary reason for both discontinuation and 
dose reduction was hypotension. One patient in 
the placebo group was lost to follow-up for car-
diovascular mortality. The median duration of 
follow-up was 15 months, with no significant 
difference between the groups; follow-up ended 
in January 2016.
Primary and Secondary Outcomes
The coprimary outcome of death from cardio-
vascular causes occurred in 236 patients in the 
ularitide group and 225 patients in the placebo 
group (21.7% vs. 21.0%; hazard ratio, 1.03; 96% 
confidence interval [CI], 0.85 to 1.25; P 
= 
0.75) 
(Table 2 and Fig. 2). The lack of a significant 
difference between the two groups was seen con-
sistently across prespecified subgroups (except for 
a nominally significant interaction for geographi-
cal region), as well as in subgroups that were de-
fined according to baseline levels of NT-proBNP 
and cardiac troponin (Fig. S3 in the Supplemen-
tary Appendix). The distribution of responses for 
the clinical composite (the second coprimary 
outcome) did not differ significantly between 
the groups (Table 2, and Table S3 in the Supple-
mentary Appendix). In a post hoc analysis that 
excluded the patients who had been identified 
before the database lock as having been ineligi-
ble for the trial, a benefit of ularitide was shown 
with respect to the hierarchical clinical compos-
ite outcome (P 
= 
0.03) but not with respect to 
cardiovascular mortality (Table S4 in the Supple-
mentary Appendix).

Effect of Ularitide in Acute Heart Failure
Because the tests for the two coprimary out-
comes were not significant, and given the hier-
archical testing plan, all secondary end-point 
analyses were exploratory. There was no benefit 
of ularitide for any of the clinical secondary 
outcome measures (Table 2).
Biomarkers of Drug Response
The mean decrease in systolic blood pressure in 
the ularitide group was greater by 6.8 mm Hg at 
6 hours and by 3.9 mm Hg at 48 hours than in the 
placebo group (P<0.001 for both comparisons); 
these between-group differences dissipated over 
a period of 72 to 120 hours (Fig. S4 in the Sup-
plementary Appendix). Among the 1923 patients 
(89%) for whom data were available, the magni-
tude of the decrease in levels of NT-proBNP at 
48 hours was 47% greater in the ularitide group 
than in the placebo group (P<0.001). Cardiac 
troponin T measurements were obtained at base-
line and at 48 hours in 1182 patients (55%); there 
was no significant between-group difference in 
the change in the cardiac troponin T level be-
tween baseline and 48 hours (P 
= 
0.70) (Table 2).
During the first 48 hours, there were 55 adju-
dicated episodes of in-hospital heart-failure events 
in 46 patients in the ularitide group, as compared 
with 87 episodes in 75 patients in the placebo 
group. A post hoc comparison showed that this 
difference was nominally significant (P 
= 
0.005)

events are summarized in Tables S5 and S6 in 
the Supplementary Appendix.) The between-group

Safety
Patients in the ularitide group were more likely 
than those in the placebo group to have hypo-
tension and to discontinue treatment because of 
it (Table S7 in the Supplementary Appendix). At 
48 hours, the ularitide group had significantly 
higher hematocrit values (P<0.001) and serum 
creatinine levels (P 
= 
0.005) and lower hepatic 
aminotransferase values (P<0.001) than did those 
in the placebo group (Table S8 in the Supple-
mentary Appendix). The increase in the serum 
creatinine level persisted at 72 hours but not 
after 30 days.
Discussion
In the TRUE-AHF trial, ularitide exerted its ex-
pected short-term hemodynamic effects.21 The 
drug produced systemic vasodilation (as evidenced 
by decreases in systolic blood pressure), which 
was accompanied by decreases in NT-proBNP 
levels (reflecting a reduction in cardiac-wall 
stress). Both the hematocrit and serum creati-
nine levels increased during the infusion, point-
ing to hemoconcentration22-24 and (together with 
a decrease in liver enzymes indicative of less 
hepatic congestion9) to aggressive decongestion; 
these effects were paralleled by a decrease in the 
rate of in-hospital heart-failure events during the 
infusion. Such early worsening events have been 
linked to increases in both cardiac filling pres-
sures and cardiac troponin levels,25-28 which sug-
gests that these events may reflect undertreated 
ventricular distention and acute cardiac injury at 
the time of initial admission. A reduction in 
cardiac-wall stress that is achieved rapidly after 
clinical presentation might be expected to re-
duce myocardial necrosis, preserve ventricular 
function, maintain clinical stability, and reduce 
the long-term risk of cardiovascular death.9-12
However, even though the time from clinical 
evaluation to pharmacologic intervention was 
shorter than in previous studies,14-16,29-32 and de-
spite evidence of meaningful cardiac deconges-
tion, the long-term risk of cardiovascular death 
was not reduced among patients who received 
ularitide. This lack of benefit raises doubt about

Figure 3. In-Hospital Heart-Failure Events.
Investigators recorded each episode of persistent or 
worsening heart failure as an event requiring a specific 
intervention during the interval from the initiation of 
the study-drug infusion to 120 hours. A patient could 
have more than 1 heart-failure event during the study 
interval. (Details regarding the definition of persistent 
or worsening heart failure are provided in the Supple-
mentary Appendix.) The cumulative total number of 
in-hospital heart-failure events during the 120-hour pe-
riod was 115 in the ularitide group and 126 in the pla-
cebo group, a difference that was not significant 
(P = 0.63). However, in a post hoc analysis, the cumula-
tive total number of in-hospital heart-failure events 
during the first 48 hours (i.e., during the study-drug 
infusion) was 55 in the ularitide group and 75 in the 
placebo group, a difference that was nominally signifi-
cant (P = 0.005).

Effect of Ularitide in Acute Heart Failure
the theories that early ventricular distention 
causes myocardial necrosis and adversely affects 
the natural history of heart failure after hospi-
talization and that rapid reversal of short-term 
ventricular distention preserves myocardial via-
bility.9,11,12,16,17,31 For all the patients who under-
went randomization, a clinical composite end 
point was also not affected by treatment.
Our findings differ from those of the RELAX-
AHF trial, in which treatment with the vasodila-
tor serelaxin (at a median of 7 hours after clini-
cal evaluation) led to decreases in NT-proBNP 
levels and in rates of in-hospital worsening of 
heart failure, reductions that were followed by 
decreases in cardiovascular mortality.9,14 How-
ever, in the RELAX-AHF trial, the reported sur-
vival benefits may have been due to chance, since 
investigators did not adjudicate in-hospital heart-
failure events, the trial was not designed to reli-
ably evaluate the risk of cardiovascular death, 
and the reduced risk of death was least apparent 
among patients who received very early therapy.33 
The patients who received serelaxin had a small 
(<10%) transient decrease in cardiac troponin 
levels, a finding that was not observed in TRUE-
AHF or in trials of other vasodilators.27,34 The 
importance of this finding is questionable, since 
serelaxin did not reduce mortality in the recently 
completed RELAX-AHF-2 trial.35
Hypotension was an expected side effect of 
ularitide. In other large-scale trials involving 
patients with acute heart failure, hypotension 
that was reported before the initiation of the 
infusion or during the infusion was associated 
with unfavorable effects on morbidity and mor-
tality,15,36 which suggests that hypotension may 
limit the benefits of any reduction in cardiac-wall 
stress. However, our patients had higher systolic 
blood pressures than did the patients with acute 
heart failure who were enrolled in most earlier 
trials,15,29-32 so they should have had better toler-
ance for vasodilator therapy. In the RELAX-AHF 
trial, serelaxin was associated with hypotensive 
effects similar to those reported in our trial.37
The results of our trial should be interpreted 
with caution. Our study design allowed patients 
to receive the study drug very early after the 
initial clinical evaluation (median, 6 hours). Pos-
sibly, even earlier intervention (e.g., 1 to 3 hours 
after evaluation) might have shown more favor-
able results, although the subgroup of patients 
with the earliest intervention did not have a more 
favorable response in our trial or in an earlier 
study.34 Cardiac troponin T was remeasured at 
only one point in time and in only about half the 
patients; our findings might have been different 
if we had sampled this value more extensively. 
However, cardiovascular mortality was not re-
duced by ularitide, so any drug-related effect on 
myocardial injury that we might have missed was 
transient and unlikely to have been clinically 
relevant.
In conclusion, we evaluated the effect of early 
administration of the vasodilator ularitide in pa-
tients with acute heart failure. Ularitide reduced 
cardiac-wall stress more markedly than placebo, 
as indicated by more rapid reduction in NT-proBNP 
levels. However, in an intention-to-treat analysis, 
the drug did not reduce myocardial injury (as 
indicated by cardiac troponin T levels), did not 
affect a clinical composite end point, and did 
not influence disease progression, as shown by 
the lack of effect on cardiovascular mortality.
