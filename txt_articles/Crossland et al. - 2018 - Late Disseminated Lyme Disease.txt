Nonhuman primates currently serve as the best experimental model for Lyme disease because of their
close genetic homology with humans and demonstration of all three phases of disease after infection
with Borrelia burgdorferi. We investigated the pathology associated with late disseminated Lyme disease
(12 to 13 months after tick inoculation) in doxycycline-treated (28 days; 5 mg/kg, oral, twice daily) and
untreated rhesus macaques. Minimal to moderate lymphoplasmacytic inflammation, with a predilection
for perivascular spaces and collagenous tissues, was observed in multiple tissues, including the cerebral
leptomeninges, brainstem, peripheral nerves from both fore and hind limbs, stifle synovium and per-
isynovial adipose tissue, urinary bladder, skeletal muscle, myocardium, and visceral pericardium. In-
direct immunofluorescence assays that combined monoclonal (outer surface protein A) and polyclonal
antibodies were performed on all tissue sections that contained inflammation. Rare morphologically
intact spirochetes were observed in the brains of two treated rhesus macaques, the heart of one treated
rhesus macaque, and adjacent to a peripheral nerve of an untreated animal. Borrelia antigen staining of
probable spirochete cross sections was also observed in heart, skeletal muscle, and near peripheral
nerves of treated and untreated animals. These findings support the notion that chronic Lyme disease
symptoms can be attributable to residual inflammation in and around tissues that harbor a low burden
of persistent host-adapted spirochetes and/or residual antigen. (Am J Pathol 2018, 188: 672e682;

The first well-documented indication of Lyme disease (LD)
in the United States occurred in the early 1970s, manifesting
as an outbreak of asymmetric large joint oligoarthritis in the
community of Lyme, Connecticut.1,2 Steere et al1 speculated
that the tight geographic clustering in a sparsely populated,
heavily wooded area and the peak incidence in the summer
and early fall months were suggestive of an arthropod-
vectored disease. This hypothesis was later confirmed by
Burgdorfer et al,3 who isolated Treponema-like spirochete
bacteria from adult Ixodes dammini (scapularis) ticks on
Shelter Island, New York. The spirochetes were named
Borrelia burgdorferi after their discoverer.3 Currently, LD
is known to be caused by multiple closely related geno-
species classified within the B. burgdorferi sensu lato
complex, representing the most common tickborne human
disease in the Northern Hemisphere.4,5 Although approxi-
mately 30,000 physician-reported cases occur annually in
the United States, the annual incidence has been estimated
to be 10-fold higher by the Centers for Disease Control and
Prevention.6
Current antibiotic therapy guidelines outlined by the
Infectious Disease Society of America (IDSA) are suc-
cessful in the treatment of LD for most patients with LD,

 especially when administered early in disease immediately
after identification of erythema migrans (EM).7 Although
EM is considered an early localized reaction and clinical
hallmark of LD, EM is not pathognomonic and is not
observed in 100% of cases,8 which results in delays in
treatment that range from weeks to months after initial
exposure. Chronic subjective symptoms (ie, musculoskel-
etal pains, cognitive dysfunction, radicular pain, pares-
thesia, dysesthesia, and/or fatigue) and, less commonly,
objective clinical signs (ie, arthritis and/or neurologic
deficits), which remain for months to years after comple-
tion of recommended antibiotic therapy in patients with
well-documented LD, are classified into posttreatment LD
syndrome (PTLDS).9
Considerable confusion and controversy exist about the
frequency and cause of PTLDS and even about its existence.
Although progress has been made in the development of a
standard case definition for PTLDS, the absence of an
available test to confirm or rule out persistence of B.
burgdorferi adds to the quandary.9,10 We and others have
speculated that decreased efficacy of antibiotic treatment in
LD may be attributed to several causes, including the
following: i) host-adapted spirochetes that persist in the
tissues, probably in small numbers, inaccessible or imper-
vious to antibiotics; ii) inflammatory responses to residual
antigens from dead organisms; iii) residual tissue damage
after pathogen clearance; and/or iv) autoimmune responses,
possibly elicited by antigenic mimicry.11e13 Experimental
studies on immunocompetent mice, dogs, and rhesus ma-
caques have provided evidence of the persistence of B.
burgdorferi spirochetes subsequent to antibiotic treatment in
the form of residual spirochetes detected within tissue by
immunofluorescent assay (IFA) and PCR and recovered by
xenodiagnoses.13e17 These findings support the role of
persistent, host-adapted B. burgdorferi spirochetes in the
etiology of PTLDS, yet these spirochetes may be difficult to
impossible to regrow by current tissue culture methods after
prolonged infection. This experimental dilemma is paral-
leled by clinical observations of negative culture results in
confirmed cases of Lyme carditis that resulted in sudden
cardiac death, in which morphologically intact spirochetes
were
readily
observed
in
affected
heart
sections
by
immunohistochemistry.18
We used tick-mediated inoculation of B. burgdorferi
strain B31 into nonhuman primates (NHPs), followed by
doxycycline treatment directed toward disseminated disease,
thus aiming to accurately model chronic LD of humans
whose treatment is delayed. It was hypothesized that late-
stage disseminated LD in rhesus macaques infected by
tick bite would display residual microscopic pathologic
findings in a variety of different tissues previously indicated
in natural and experimental LD [ie, peripheral nervous
system, central nervous system, heart, skeletal muscle, and
joint-associated tissues] and that this pathologic finding
would be directly associated with residual spirochetal anti-
gens and/or viable host-adapted spirochetes.
Materials and Methods
Ethical Statement
Practices in the housing and care of animals conformed to the
regulations and standards of the Public Health Service Policy
on Humane Care and Use of Laboratory Animals and the
Guide for the Care and Use of Laboratory Animals.19 The
Tulane National Primate Research Center (Animal Welfare
Assurance A4499-01) is fully accredited by the Association
for the Assessment and Accreditation of Laboratory Animal
CareeInternational. The Institutional Animal Care and Use
Committee of the Tulane National Primate Research Center
approved all animal-related protocols, including the infec-
tion, treatment, and tick-feeding procedures used with NHPs.
All animal procedures were overseen by veterinarians and
performed by veterinarians or trained staff. Euthanasia was
conducted by anesthesia with ketamine hydrochloride (10
mg/kg) followed by an overdose with sodium pentobarbital.
This method is consistent with the recommendation of the
American Veterinary Medical Association guidelines.
Animals, Inoculations, and Treatment
Ten male rhesus macaques of Indian origin, 3 to 4 years of
age, were fed on by I. scapularis nymphal ticks that harbored
B. burgdorferi. To ensure infection, I. scapularis nymphs
were fed the spirochetes via capillary tubes (from a mid-log
phase culture of strain B31) as previously described.20,21
Ten B. burgdorferiecontaining nymphs were placed on the
backs of all 10 monkeys in a tick containment device, as
previously described.13,21 Ticks were allowed to feed for 4
days to transmit infection. A recently developed five-antigen
Bioplex assay was used to detect and quantify antibody re-
sponses.22 Skin biopsy samples were also used to verify
infection by culture and PCR.13 Half of the animals produced
positive skin biopsy cultures, and 8 of 10 were PCR positive.
At 4 months after inoculation, half (five) of the NHPs received
antibiotic treatment, consisting of 5 mg/kg of oral doxycy-
cline twice per day. The treatment lasted 28 days, and no
instances of nonadherence were observed. With the exception
of IK14 (0.1 to 0.26 mg/mL), the serum values obtained at 12
hours after dosing (0.98 to 1.87 mg/mL) were above or
consistent with expected trough values derived from our
previous pharmacokinetic study.23 Blood was drawn at day 0,
every 2 weeks for the first 5 months, then monthly thereafter.
Further details of the serologic responses, serum doxycycline
concentrations, and detection of persistent spirochetes by
multiple methods are discussed in Embers et al.24 Necropsies
were performed at 8 to 9 months after the cessation of treat-
ment (12 to 13 months after inoculation).
Histopathologic Analysis and Microscopic Grading

brainstem), dura mater, spinal cord (cervical, thoracic,

 lumbar, and sacral) and associated dorsal root ganglia,
peripheral nerves (radial, ulnar, tibial, and sural), joint-
associated tissues (shoulder and stifle), heart, skeletal mus-
cle, lung, spleen, axillary and mesenteric lymph nodes, and
urinary bladder were collected from each animal, fixed in
Z-fix (Anatech Ltd., Battle Creek, MI) for 24 to 48 hours,
embedded in paraffin, sectioned at 5 mm, and stained with
hematoxylin and eosin. Peripheral nerves were mistakenly
not collected for routine histopathologic analysis from one
untreated animal (IP67). Hematoxylin and eosinestained
sections were evaluated by a light microscope and imaged
with a digital camera. Two independent veterinary pathol-
ogists (N.A.C. and Dr. Peter J. Didier) evaluated tissues.
Initially, all tissues were evaluated to determine the vari-
ability and severity of pathologic findings from all samples,
with the pathologists blinded to the treatment groups
(N.A.C. and Dr. Peter J. Didier). Tissues that were observed
to contain pathologic findings were used as a roadmap for
subsequent
immunofluorescent
staining
to
identify
B.
burgdorferi. On the basis of the range of lesions observed,
an ordinal scoring system ranging from 0 to 3 was devel-
oped to classify inflammatory profiles. A zero score indi-
cated that inflammation was not observed, a score of 1
indicated minimal localized lymphoplasmacytic inflamma-
tion, a score of 2 indicated minimal lymphoplasmacytic
inflammation with multifocal distribution or mild inflam-
mation with focal or multifocal distribution, and a score of 3
indicated moderate lymphoplasmacytic inflammation. A
score of 3 was always associated with a multifocal distri-
bution. Control tissues were obtained from four male, age-
matched, rhesus macaques. Two of these animals were
control, sham (intrathecal) inoculated subjects from a pre-
vious Lyme neuroborreliosis study.25 The additional two
rhesus macaques were humanely euthanized because of
intractable chronic diarrhea and had not previously been in
an LD study. Statistical analyses were conducted with
GraphPad Prism software version 6 (GraphPad Software,
Inc., San Diego, CA).
Detection of B. burgdorferi by Indirect IFA
An identical set of tissues as previously described in
Histopathologic Analysis and Microscopic Grading were
also collected at necropsy (in addition to peripheral nerves
from IP67), placed in PolyCon containers that contained
OCT medium, frozen immediately in a dry ice/methanol
bath, and then stored at ï¿½80ï¿½C. Only sections with inflam-
mation confirmed through histopathologic analysis were
evaluated by IFA. Frozen samples were processed by cry-
osectioning (at 15 mm), with four to eight sections (60 to 120
mm) of each tissue examined, depending on how much tissue
could fit onto four slides. All incubations were performed at
room temperature, and all wash steps were performed for 10
minutes while gently rocking in Kopplin jars unless other-
wise stated. Frozen sections were thawed for 20 minutes,
followed by submersion in 4% paraformaldehyde for 20
minutes at 4ï¿½C. Slides were then washed twice with 1ï¿½
phosphate-buffered saline (PBS), and tissues were circled by
a wax pen. Next, tissues were submerged in 100 mmol/L
glycine diluted in PBS, 0.2% fish skin gelatin (FSG), and
0.1% Triton X-100 to neutralize residual paraformaldehyde.
Before blocking of slides, two additional wash steps were
performed with PBS, FSG, and Triton X-100 and PBS and
FSG, respectively. In a dark humidified staining box, the
slides were blocked with 10% normal goat serum, PBS, and
FSG for 1 hour. Blocking agent was gently removed from the
slides by tapping the glass edge onto a paper towel imme-
diately before the addition of primary antibodies. Two pri-
mary antibodies were used simultaneously, which included a
rabbit polyclonal antieB. burgdorferi (derived from a
hyperimmunized rabbit 6 weeks after inoculation with
in vitro propagated B. burgdorferi strain B3126) and an
antieouter surface protein A (OspA) monoclonal IgG hy-
bridoma supernatant [CB10, kindly provided by Dr. Jorge
Benach (Stony Brook University School of Medicine, Stony
Brook, NY)]. Polyclonal rabbit serum was diluted 1:300, and
the monoclonal antibody hybridoma supernatant was diluted
1:40 in normal goat serum, PBS, and FSG, with approxi-
mately 300 mL added to each tissue section, followed by a 1-
hour incubation. Slides were washed twice with PBS, FSG,
and Triton X-100 and a final rinse with PBS and FSG. Tissue
sections were then incubated for 1 hour with 300 mL of
secondary antibodies conjugated to fluorescent dyes diluted
1:1000 in normal goat serum, PBS, and FSG (Goat Anti-
Rabbit IgG-Alexa Fluor 488, catalog number A32731 and
Goat Anti-Mouse IgG Alexa Fluor 568, catalog number A-
11004; Thermo Fisher Scientific, Waltham, MA). Three
additional wash steps identical to those performed after in-
cubation with primary antibodies were performed. After the
final wash, slides were partially dried by tapping the glass
edge onto a paper towel and immediately mounted with an
in-house prepared antiquenching glycerol-based mounting
media, coverslipped, and allowed to sit overnight. Pre-
inoculation serum from the rabbit used to obtain hyperim-
mune serum was used in the primary antibody step (diluted
1:300) to serve as a negative control, which displayed neither
red nor green fluorescence when applied to positive control
slides. Brain sections from a rhesus macaque that were cut to
15 mm and incubated with B. burgdorferi strain B31 ex vivo
served as a positive control.27 In addition, the IFA was per-
formed on frozen sections that originated from one of the
control animals that was euthanized because of intractable
diarrhea. For this control animal, IFA was performed on an
identical set of tissues as examined in experimental animals.
Spirochetes were not observed in any of control animal
sections examined. Imaging was performed with a Leica
DMi8 confocal microscope equipped with three lasers (Leica
Microsystems, Wetzlar, Germany) using a 63ï¿½ objective,
with a resolution of 1024 ï¿½ 1024 pixels. An additional 2ï¿½
amplification was applied with Leica LAS X software
version 10 (Leica Microsystems Inc., Buffalo Grove, IL)
when appropriate. Start and stop depths were assigned for

 each image, allowing for maximization by z stacking of
images. Frame average was set at 2. Laser intensity was
optimized on positive control tissues and remained constant
for all test specimens. Volocity three-dimensional image
analysis software version 6.3.1 (Perkin Elmer, Waltham,
MA) was used to render images for three-dimensional display
and angle rotation. Adobe Photoshop CC 2017 and InDesign
2017 software (Adobe Systems, San Jose, CA) were used to
process and assemble the images and figures, respectively.
When made, adjustments to brightness, contrast, or color
balance were applied to the whole image.
RNAscope ISH Procedure
RNAscope is commercially available from Advanced Cell
Diagnostics (Newark, CA).28 RNA in situ hybridization
(ISH) was performed using the RNAscope Multiplex
Fluorescent Detection Kit version 2 according to the man-
ufacturerâs guidelines. In brief, for each specimen investi-
gated, three serial, 15-mm fresh-frozen sections were fixed in
4% paraformaldehyde at 4ï¿½C for 15 minutes and dehydrated
in a series of ethanol washes. Slides were then treated with
RNAscope hydrogen peroxide for 10 minutes and RNA-
scope protease IV for 30 minutes at room temperature. A
different probe was used for each of the three serial sections,
which included the following: B. burgdorferi probe (23S
rRNA transcript, catalog number 468211), positive probe
[rhesus macaque peptidyl-prolyl cis-trans isomerase (PPIB),
catalog number 457711] and negative probe (Bacillus sub-
tillis dapB, catalog number 320871). Each of the probes
were designed and synthesized by Advanced Cell Di-
agnostics. After the amplification process, tyramide signal
amplification cyanine 5 was used to visualize the ISH re-
action (Perkin Elmer; catalog number SAT705A001 EA).
Tissues were mounted with a glycerol-based antiquenching
media prepared in house, coverslipped, and allowed to sit
overnight. Imaging was performed with a Leica DMi8
confocal microscope as previously described in Detection of
B. burgdorferi by Indirect IFA.
Results
For the sake of continuity, histopathologic, IFA, and ISH
results are described together by organ system. When stated,

antibodies

or
mouse
hybridoma-derived
anti-OspA
monoclonal antibodies (Figure 1B). Given the sectioning at
15 mM, spirochetes can be observed as full length in the
lateral plane, as cross sections, or as fragments (Figure 1, A
and B). A merged image of green and red channels is pro-
vided from ex vivo brain tissue cultured with B. burgdorferi
strain B31 in vitro (Figure 1C). A summary of results can be
found in Table 1. No significant gross findings were
observed in any of the experimental animals.
Nervous System
Minimal and focal lymphoplasmacytic inflammation of the
central nervous system was observed in two animals, both
of which were treated with doxycycline (IH11 and IH22). In
IH11, inflammation was observed in the leptomeninges
overlying a section of temporal cerebral cortex (Figure 1D,
Supplemental Figure S1), whereas inflammation in IH22
was characterized by perivascular inflammation of the
brainstem adjacent to the fourth ventricle (Figure 1E). Green
fluorescent B. burgdorferiespecific staining was detected
free within the neuropil of both these animals (Figure 1, F
and G) and was not directly associated with the minimal
inflammation observed histologically. Of all the sections
examined in this study, the greatest density of morpholog-
ically intact spirochetes was observed in the cerebrum of
IH11, with up to six spirochetes observed in a single high-
powered field (63ï¿½). Because of the limited number of
animals tested, the proportion of monkeys that exhibited
inflammation in the CNS between the treated (two of five
monkeys) and untreated group (zero of five monkeys) was
not significantly different (Fisherâs exact test, two-tailed,
P Z 0.444). When IFA was multiplexed with RNA ISH
(Supplemental Figure S2), colocalization of B. burgdorferi
immunofluorescence was not observed with a 23S rRNA B.
burgdorferi probe (Supplemental Figure S1). Minimal
localized lymphoplasmacytic choroiditis was observed in
one of the four control animals; however, no inflammation
was observed in a representative section of cerebrum, cer-
ebellum, brainstem, spinal cord, or dura mater from un-
treated or control animals (Table 1).
Peripheral nerves contained minimal to moderate lym-
phoplasmacytic
inflammation
with
a
predilection
for
collagen-rich epineurium and perivascular spaces (Figure 1,
HeJ). Inflammation was observed in five of nine NHPs
(56%) irrespective of treatment group, with three of four
untreated (75%) and two of five doxycycline-treated (40%)
animals affected. Grade 3 inflammation scores (moderate)
were observed in two untreated animals, and multiple pe-
ripheral nerves were affected in all three untreated animals
(Table 1). For all animals, inflammation was reserved to
perineural tissue. No inflammation was observed within
nerve fibers, and there was no evidence of axonal degener-
ation that would have been supported by the presence of
dilated myelin sheaths or axonal spheroids. The frequency of
lymphoplasmacytic
perineuritis
(in
decreasing
order)
involved the left sural (n Z 3/9), right ulnar (n Z 3/9), left
tibial (n Z 1/9), right tibial (n Z 1/9), right sural (n Z 1/9),
right median (n Z 1/9), left median (n Z 1/9), cervical spinal
nerve (n Z 1/9), and lumbar spinal nerve (n Z 1/9). No
inflammation was observed in dorsal root ganglia from any of
the animals, and there was no histologic evidence of neuronal
degeneration or necrosis (ie, chromatolysis and shrunken
angular hypereosinophilic neurons, respectively). Peripheral
nerves for IP67 (untreated) were mistakenly not collected for
hematoxylin and eosin and thus were unavailable for routine

 histopathologic evaluation; however, sections were collected
from frozen specimens and immunofluorescence was per-
formed. Green fluorescent staining for B. burgdorferi was
observed in untreated animals IP55 (Figure 1, K) and IP67
(Figure 1, L), represented by a morphologically intact
spirochete in the former. Minimal localized perivascular
lymphoplasmacytic perineuritis that affected the right sural
nerve was observed in one of the four control animals. Pos-
itive B. burgdorferiespecific fluorescence was not observed
in representative sections of CNS and peripheral nervous
system tissues derived from control animals.
Heart
Minimal to mild lymphoplasmacytic inflammation of the
myocardial
interstitium
(Figure
2A),
pericardium
(Figure 2B), or combination therein was observed in 60% of
NHPs irrespective of treatment groups, with two of five
untreated (40%) and four of five doxycycline-treated (80%)
NHPs affected. Lymphoplasmacytic inflammation of the
pericardium was only observed in animals with myocardial
involvement. Inflammation was not associated with histo-
logic evidence of myocardial degeneration, necrosis, and/or
fibrosis. A single morphologically intact spirochete, as
indicated by positive red immunofluorescence (Figure 2C),
was observed in the myocardium of one treated animal
(IK14).
Moderate
lymphoplasmacytic
myocarditis
was
observed in one of the four control animals; however, this
animal also had marked myocardial fibrosis, which was not
observed in any of the other experimental or control
animals. This animal also had evidence of systemic illness
ultimately attributed to severe chronic intractable colitis and
was the oldest of all the control animals used. No immu-
nofluorescence was observed in representative sections of
myocardium and pericardium derived from control animals.
Skeletal Muscle
Random sections of arm and thigh skeletal muscle were
obtained from each animal. Of all the animals examined,
mild,
multifocal
lymphoplasmacytic
inflammation
was
observed
in
one
doxycycline-treated
animal
(IK66)
(Figure 2D), with concurrent positive fluorescence in the
form of antigen co-localized with both B. burgdorfer-
iespecific antibodies observed (Figure 2, EeG). When
consecutive layers of confocal imagining were combined
into three dimensions, the antigen was in the form of a
cylinder, indicating that this was indeed a cross section of
the spirochete (Supplemental Video S1). In this animal,
inflammation was characterized by perivascular and inter-
stitial distribution but was not associated with concurrent
histologic evidence of rhabdomyocyte degeneration, ne-
crosis, and/or fibrosis. No inflammation or positive fluo-
rescence was observed in representative sections of skeletal
muscle derived from control animals.

 structures, all of which involved the stifle joints. In two an-
imals, one untreated (IN16) and one treated (IH11), inflam-
mation
was
present
within
the
synovial
membrane
(Figure 2H). These animals also had concurrent synovial
epithelial hyperplasia that ranged from minimal to mild. One
doxycycline-treated animal (IL09) contained minimal peri-
vascular lymphoplasmacytic inflammation in the perisynovial
adipose tissue (Figure 2I). Positive red fluorescent anti-OspA
staining of what appears to be a cross section of the spiro-
chete (Figure 2J) was observed in one doxycycline-treated
animal (IL09). Joint synovium was not collected from
Lyme neuroborreliosis control animals; however, synovium
(bilateral stifle and shoulder joints) was collected from two
animals with chronic treatment-resistant diarrhea with no
gross evidence of joint disease. Minimal localized lympho-
plasmacytic inflammation was observed in the synovium of
one animal, but synovial hyperplasia and perivascular
inflammation of perisynovial
adipose
tissue were
not
observed and no positive fluorescence was observed.
Additional Tissues
Other tissues examined histologically included axillary and
mesenteric lymph nodes, urinary bladder, lung, and spleen.
Findings in these tissues were similar among treatment
groups and control tissues. Thus, findings were interpreted as
nonspecific, and their overall significance was indeterminate.
Reactive lymphoid hyperplasia was observed to some extent
in all lymph nodes examined (not shown) and was more
prominent in mesenteric lymph nodes, ranging from minimal
to moderate. The latter was characterized by prominent
cortical lymphoid follicles with germinal centers, variable
degrees of sinus histiocytosis, and anthracosis in the case of
axillary lymph nodes. Minimal to mild lymphoplasmacytic
inflammation was observed within the lamina propria of the
urinary bladder (Figure 2K), with rare discrete formation of
lymphoid follicles (Figure 2L) observed irrespective of
treatment groups and control specimens. Because B. burg-
dorferi has previously been cultured from the urinary blad-
ders of experimental animals29 and all animals had some
degree of inflammation, IFA was performed on all study
animals, with one positively identified spirochete and/or
spirochetal antigen observed in untreated animal IL75
(Figure 2M). No positive fluorescence was detected in con-
trol specimens. Splenic white pulp displayed minimal to mild
lymphoid hyperplasia irrespective of treatment group and in
control specimens. Lastly, lung sections from both treatment
groups and control animals displayed minimal to mild peri-
bronchiolar and perivascular lymphoplasmacytic inflamma-
tion, with mild anthracosis, and mild alveolar histiocytosis
(not shown). One untreated animal (IH22) had multifocal,
mild, patchy granulomatous interstitial inflammation. Special
stains and/or bacterial culture were not performed on this
case, but intralesional birefringent foreign material appeared
to be associated with the granulomatous inflammation, sug-
gestive of a foreign-body response.
Discussion
Posttreatment LD remains a poorly understood syndrome,
occurring in an estimated 10% to 20% of humans treated
under current IDSA guidelines.30 Multiple randomized,
placebo-controlled studies that evaluated sustained antimi-
crobial therapy concluded that there is no benefit in allevi-
ating patientsâ symptoms and indicated that long-term
antibiotic therapy may even be detrimental to patients
because of potential associated complications (ie, catheter
infection and/or clostridial colitis).31e33 A model of late
disseminated borreliosis was chosen over other stages of
disease because of a general consensus that most patients
treated for LD during early localized LD recover from the
infection.
In this study, we found microscopic pathologic findings
that range from minimal to moderate in multiple different
tissues previously reported to be involved with LD, including
the nervous system (central and peripheral), heart, skeletal
muscle, joint-associated tissues, and urinary bladder 12 to 13
months after tick inoculation of rhesus macaques by B.
burgdorferi strain B31. On the basis of histomorphologic
findings, inflammation consisted predominantly of lympho-
cytes and plasma cells, with rare scattered histiocytes. A
predilection for perivascular spaces and an affinity for
collagenous tissue was a common theme among examined
tissues. Furthermore, in rare instances, morphologically intact
spirochetes were observed in inflamed brain and heart tissue
sections from doxycycline-treated animals. Because no
inflammation was observed in the CNS of untreated animals,
we cannot definitely determine whether spirochetes were also
present in those cases. The ISH/IFA multiplex protocol was
successfully optimized on ex vivo rhesus macaque brain tis-
sues cultured with B. burgdorferi strain B31 (Supplemental
Figure S2, AeD). However, colocalization of the B. burg-
dorferi 23S rRNA probe was not observed in any of the
sections of experimental inoculated animals found to harbor
rare persistent spirochetes (Supplemental Figure S1). Previ-
ous in vitro work has found large decreases in B. burgdorferi
rRNA levels when in a stationary phase of growth despite
most spirochetes remaining viable34 and may help afford an
explanation for these results when compared with validation
results of the multiplex assay in the positive control tissues.
In addition, the control specimens were fixed before freezing,
and the experimental specimens were not. The possibility that
the spirochetes were intact but dead also exists, although this
may be unlikely given the precedence for viable but non-
cultivable B. burgdorferi after treatment16 and the rapid
clearance of dead spirochetes in a murine model.35 Future
studies would benefit from the use of genes associated with
dormancy for ISH to determine whether rare host-adapted
spirochetes present in late disseminated LD are transcrip-
tionally active.
The doxycycline dose used in this study (5 mg/kg) was
based on a previous pharmacokinetic analysis of oral
doxycycline in rhesus macaques proven to be comparable to

 levels achieved in humans and was meant to mimic treat-
ment of disseminated LD.23 The most relevant property of a
bacteriostatic antibiotic such as doxycycline is the minimum
inhibitory concentration. With the exception of IK14, trough
levels of doxycycline were found to be >0.8 mg/mL, which
is above the minimum inhibitory concentration for the B.
burgdorferi strain used in this study.23 These results indicate
that the dosage used in this study is sufficient in establishing
an efficacious ratio of area under the concentration-time
curve from 0 to 24 hours to minimum inhibitory concen-
tration, which represents the best indicator of doxycycline
efficacy. Although current IDSA guidelines recommend i.v.
ceftriaxone (2 g per day for 30 days) over oral doxycycline
for treatment of neuroborreliosis, a randomized clinical trial
failed to show any enhanced efficacy of i.v. penicillin G to
oral doxycycline for treatment of Lyme neuroborreliosis (no
treatment failures were reported in this study of 54 patients).
Although we did not measure the doxycycline levels in the
cerebrospinal fluid, they have been found to be 12% to 15%
of the amount measured in serum,36 suggesting that higher
doses may be needed to combat neuroborreliosis. The
treatment protocol began in the early disseminated phase,37
without objective indications of neurologic impairment in
the primates, and therefore followed the recommended
course of doxycycline for 28 days. In the context of another
study, these findings suggest that the antibiotic protocol
should not represent a major limitation.38
B. burgdorferi spirochetes are not known to carry any
specific genes that function to confer resistance to the rec-
ommended antibiotics (tetracyclines and cephalosporins).39
We and others have found the development of a drug-
tolerant persister population when B. burgdorferi are
treated with antibiotics in vitro.40,41 The adoption of a
dormant or slow-growing phenotype likely allows the spi-
rochetes to survive and regrow after removal of antibiotic.
Neutrophil calprotectin may also contribute to antibiotic
tolerance by inhibiting the growth of B. burgdorferi near
inflammatory lesions.42 The basic premise that antibiotic
tolerance may be an adaptation of the sophisticated stringent
response required for the enzootic cycle by the spirochetes
is described in a recent review as well.43 In 2014, a trail-
blazing study in mice found a marked decrease in B.
burgdorferi DNA in the tissues for up to 8 months after
antibiotic treatment followed by the resurgence of B.
burgdorferi growth 12 months after treatment.16 This study
provides evidence that the slow-growing spirochetes that
persist after treatment but are not cultivable in standard
growth media may remain viable.
Inflammation of the CNS was only observed in the
doxycycline-treated animals, both of which contained low
numbers of morphologically intact spirochetes that were
labeled solely by B. burgdorferiespecific, rabbit-derived
polyclonal antibodies (green fluorescence) and not by
monoclonal OspA antibodies. This finding is in agreement
with
previous
observations
whereby
decreased
OspA
expression
is
met
by
reciprocal
OspC
up-regulation
associated with transmission of spirochetes from a tick to
vertebrate host.44,45 However, this finding is contradictory
to other reports that suggest OspA plays a critical role in
translocating
of
the
blood
brain
barrier
and
neuro-
invasiveness.46 With this stated, it is possible that OspA
down-regulation occurs once the spirochetes have migrated
beyond the bloodebrain barrier into the neuropil as a means
of immune evasion.
In addition to the brain of two treated animals, rare
morphologically intact spirochetes immunoreactive to OspA
were observed in the heart of one treated animal (IK14).
Increased OspA serum titers have been reported in American
patients with Lyme arthritis and indicate differential gene
expression of B. burgdorferi dependent on tissue localiza-
tion.46,47 Furthermore, experimental studies in mice have
shown enhanced OspA expression in host-adapted spirochetes
during inflammation48 and ospA transcription was evident
posttreatment in both murine studies and our prior study in
macaques.13,49 Taken together, these findings illustrate that
OspA down-regulation upon entry into mammalian hosts is
reversible under certain environmental cues and support the
use of polyclonal antibodies when trying to locate persistent
B. burgdorferi spirochetes in affected tissue sections.
In this study, approximately 400 tissue sections from the
experimental monkeys were examined. We identified rare
spirochetes in several tissues known to be affected by LD.
Although the presence of carbohydrates such as alginate,50
typically associated with biofilms, was not evaluated with
specific stains, tissues were permeabilized and then stained
specifically for B. burgdorferi. All the spirochetes that were
identified existed singly and were relatively sparse. No ag-
gregates that would be suspected to have formed a biofilm
were observed.
This is the first study in primates to comprehensively
examine pathologic findings associated with the persistence
of B. burgdorferi in the late stage of LD after antibiotic
therapy. The NHP model possesses many advantages for
studying human LD when compared with other animal
models, including close genetic complementarity while
remaining outbred (ie, approximately 93% DNA homology
to humans51) and multiorgan involvement (ie, CNS, periph-
eral nervous system, heart, skeletal muscle, and joints).52e56
Limitations from previous studies include artificial routes of
inoculation
(ie,
needle
inoculation
versus
the
natural
tick-inoculated route), high dosage of inoculum (107 to 108
spirochetes), and variable immune status of animals (ie,
immunosuppressed versus immunocompetent). These limi-
tations were abrogated in this study by use of tick inoculation
in immunocompetent animals. In the late disseminated stage
of infection (beyond 6 months), neither clinical signs nor
indications of possible symptoms, such as reduced activity or
disinterest in enrichment items, were observed by the veter-
inary staff. Taking into consideration that most PTLDS
symptoms are subjective, it is not surprising that these were
not observed or apparent, which makes it impossible for us to
definitively attribute clinical relevance to the histopathologic

 findings gained from this study. However, we can speculate
that the minimal to moderate inflammation that was observed,
especially within the CNS and peripheral nervous system,
can, in part, explain the breadth of symptoms experienced by
patients with late-stage LD, such as cognitive impairment and
neuralgia. The clinical hallmark of early localized LD is EM,
which was observed in one of the rhesus macaques from this
study. However, many of the more severe chronic manifes-
tations of LD associated with objective morbidities, such as
Lyme carditis, resulting in atrioventricular blockage or sud-
den death, and neuroborreliosis, manifesting in nerve palsy,
limb paresis, and painful radiculitis (potentially manifesting
as lameness, loss of appetite, inability to jump, muscle
spasms, reduced activity, and audible sounds of discomfort),
have yet to be reproduced experimentally in any immuno-
competent animal model.35,57 Taking into account that LD is
rarely fatal, a paucity of autopsy tissue limits opportunities to
study disease pathogenesis and pathologic findings associated
with natural disease. Furthermore, the rare human autopsy
reports that are available represent the most severe manifes-
tations of LD, which greatly limits our understanding of the
disease spectrum. Future studies will include assessment of
the ability of novel antimicrobial therapies to eliminate
persistent spirochetal infection. Furthermore, this model may
also be of great benefit in understanding host factors involved
in the development of chronic disease after B. burgdorferi
infection and help unravel the variable manifestations
observed in human cases of LD.
