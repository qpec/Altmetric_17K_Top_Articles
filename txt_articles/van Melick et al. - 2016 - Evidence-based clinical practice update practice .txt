ABSTRACT
Aim The Royal Dutch Society for Physical Therapy
(KNGF) instructed a multidisciplinary group of Dutch
anterior cruciate ligament (ACL) experts to develop an
evidence statement for rehabilitation after ACL
reconstruction.
Design Clinical practice guideline underpinned by
systematic review and expert consensus.
Data sources A multidisciplinary working group and
steering group systematically reviewed the literature and
wrote the guideline. MEDLINE and the Cochrane Library
were searched for meta-analyses, systematic reviews,
randomised controlled trials and prospective cohort
studies published between January 1990 and June
2015.
Eligibility criteria for selecting studies Included
literature must have addressed 1 of 9 predetermined
clinical topics: (1) preoperative predictors for
postoperative outcome, (2) effectiveness of physical
therapy, (3) open and closed kinetic chain quadriceps
exercises, (4) strength and neuromuscular training, (5)
electrostimulation and electromyographic feedback, (6)
cryotherapy, (7) measurements of functional
performance, (8) return to play and (9) risk for reinjury.
Summary Ninety studies were included as the basis for
the evidence statement. Rehabilitation after ACL injury
should include a prehabilitation phase and 3 criterion-
based postoperative phases: (1) impairment-based, (2)
sport-specific training and (3) return to play. A battery of
strength and hop tests, quality of movement and
psychological tests should be used to guide progression
from one rehabilitation stage to the next. Postoperative
rehabilitation should continue for 9–12 months. To
assess readiness to return to play and the risk for
reinjury, a test battery, including strength tests, hop tests
and measurement of movement quality, should be used.
INTRODUCTION
Anterior cruciate ligament reconstruction (ACLR) is
a common treatment for athletes after ACL injury.
The incidence of non-contact ACL injuries appears
to be the greatest in athletes who are between 15
and 40 years of age and participate in pivoting
sports like soccer, handball, volleyball and alpine
skiing.1 2 Every year, about 3% of amateur athletes
injure their ACL; for elite athletes, this percentage
could be as high as 15%.2 Females are two to eight
times more likely to sustain an ACL injury than
their male counterparts, probably because male and
female neuromuscular patterns diverge during and
following puberty.3–8
Besides its mechanical function in maintaining
knee stability, the ACL contains mechanoreceptors
(2.5%) and therefore directly influences the neuro-
muscular control of the knee.9 ACL deficiency
causes partial deafferentiation and alters spinal and
supraspinal motor control. The changes in motor
control strategy can reveal changes in propriocep-
tion, postural control, muscle strength, movement
and recruitment patterns.10 An ACL injury might
therefore be regarded as a neurophysiological dys-
function and not a simple peripheral musculoskel-
etal injury.11 12 It is also not self-evident that an
ACLR will automatically lead to a return to prein-
jury activity level.
Recent research shows that 35% of athletes after
ACLR do not return to preinjury sport level within
2 years.13–15 Half of these athletes report their ACL
injury as the primary reason for a lower activity
level.13 14 16–18 Apart from the physical recovery,
also the psychological response (eg, fear of rein-
jury) after ACLR has an influence on whether an
athlete chooses to return to play.19–25 Return to
play is defined as the ability to play a competitive
match at the preinjury level. Moreover, recent
research shows that 3–22% of athletes rerupture
the reconstructed ligament and 3–24% rupture the
contralateral
ACL
in
the
first
5 years
after
ACLR.17 26–30
The difficulty with determining the moment of
return to play is that it is unknown which measures
should be used to predict a safe return to play with
a low risk of a second ACL injury. Three recent sys-
tematic reviews show that the return-to-play deci-
sion by clinicians is hardly based on objective
clinimetric criteria.27
31
32 Furthermore, these
studies concluded that return to play is only con-
nected to quantitative criteria, while it is known
that qualitative criteria (eg, dynamic knee valgus,
knee flexion angle and trunk control) play an
important role in prevention and rehabilitation.
Movement quality actually may affect the ACL (re)
injury rate.33 34 The occurrence of dynamic knee
valgus when landing from a jump, for instance,
increases the risk of ACL (re)injury.35 36
Return to play is the ultimate goal of rehabilita-
tion programmes. So the above-mentioned factors
are important topics to incorporate in the rehabili-
tation process after ACLR. However, currently,
there is no consensus regarding the content of a

 rehabilitation programme. Therefore, the Royal Dutch Society
for Physical Therapy (KNGF) instructed a multidisciplinary
group of ACL experts in the Netherlands to develop an evi-
dence statement for anterior cruciate ligament rehabilitation.
The goal of this evidence statement was to describe the rehabili-
tation after ACLR and to encourage uniformity in physical
therapy treatment and use of measurements of functional per-
formance. The following three questions were formulated by a
steering group of the KNGF to guide the realisation of the evi-
dence statement:
1. What should be the content of the rehabilitation protocol
after ACLR based on scientific evidence and, if not present,
based on best practice?
2. Which measurements and assessments can be applied to
monitor progression during the rehabilitation programme
and to determine outcomes at the end of rehabilitation
programme?
3. What criteria should be used to determine the moment of
return to play?
METHODS
Expert participants
The process started with the formation of a multidisciplinary
working group and steering group. The working group con-
sisted of six Dutch ACL experts with 8–35 years of experience
in ACL rehabilitation: five physical therapists specialised in
sports injury rehabilitation and one orthopaedic surgeon specia-
lised in knee surgery, ACL surgery in particular. The steering
group consisted of ACL experts from different professions with
10–37 years of experience in ACL rehabilitation (three physical
therapists, one sports physician, one orthopaedic surgeon and
one trauma surgeon).
Procedure
The first author (NvM) chaired the working group and was
responsible for the systematic review steps (literature search,
methodological quality assessment, data extraction, data ana-
lysis, description of the results and translation into practice
guidelines) and for writing the evidence statement. The working
group monitored each step in the systematic review process and
assisted in methodological quality assessment of the included
studies, the writing process and the translation into practice
guidelines. The steering group (chairman REHvC) validated all
steps made by the first author and the working group. The
KNGF assisted in the administrative processes.
The working group contacted each other by email and every
2 months a consensus meeting was organised. Every other
meeting, the steering group joined the working group.
The first meeting of the working and steering group together,
started with the formulation of nine clinical topics important
for ACLR rehabilitation. These topics were used to guide the
systematic review process. These nine topics were: (1) preopera-
tive predictors for postoperative outcome, (2) effectiveness of
physical therapy, (3) open kinetic chain (OKC) versus closed
kinetic chain (CKC) quadriceps exercises, (4) strength training
and neuromuscular training, (5) electrostimulation and electro-
myographic feedback, (6) cryotherapy, (7) measurements of
functional performance, (8) return to play and (9) risk of
reinjuries.
Articles found during the systematic review process were sub-
divided into the nine topics and every topic was given a level of
evidence according to the EBRO (Dutch evidence-based guide-
line development) criteria.37 The recommendations were, if
available, based on the latest scientific evidence, supplemented
with best practice when necessary. The results of the systematic
review process (see online supplementary appendix 1) were
used
to
formulate
the
evidence
statement
(see
online
supplementary appendix 2).
Search strategy
A systematic literature search was performed searching in
MEDLINE (PubMed) and the Cochrane Library to identify rele-
vant articles from January 1990 up to June 2015 using key-
words specified for the database according to the nine topics
mentioned above with PICO questions (table 1). An academic
librarian composed a syntax based on all the keywords.
Meta-analyses, systematic reviews, randomised controlled trials
(RCTs) and prospective cohort studies were included for study
selection.
Study selection
All eligible articles were screened first by title and abstract inde-
pendently by two reviewers (NvM and REHvC). When the two
reviewers did not reach consensus, a third reviewer (CN) made
the final decision. After this first inclusion, the full-text article
was screened using the inclusion and exclusion criteria as listed
in table 2. In addition, a hand search was performed on the ref-
erence lists of meta-analysis and systematic reviews for RCTs
and prospective cohort studies that were not included in the
primary search. A flow chart of the search strategy is presented
in figure 1.
Methodological quality assessment
Quality assessment of the included articles was independently
performed by two reviewers (NvM and REHvC). When the
reviewers did not reach consensus, a third reviewer made the
final decision. All articles were individually graded for level of
methodological quality (table 3 and online supplementary
appendix 1).
Methodological
quality
of
meta-analyses
and
systematic
reviews was assessed with the AMSTAR checklist. The assess-
ment of risk of bias of the RCTs was performed with the PEDro
scale (http://www.pedro.org.au). The PEDro scale was scored on
10 items. Methodological quality was rated poor when an
article had a score of ≤4. Subsequently, the RCTs with poor
quality were excluded.
The prospective cohort studies were assessed with an adapted
Cochrane Library Checklist (table 4), also used before in the
KNGF guideline for urinary incontinence.38 This checklist has a
maximum score of 5. Prospective cohort studies were only used
when no higher level evidence was available or to support find-
ings in the RCTs.
Data extraction
Data extraction was performed by one reviewer (NvM). See
online supplementary appendix 1 for the data extraction table.
Results from the included studies were synthesised descriptively
for the evidence statement. Based on the results of all articles
selected in one topic, a final conclusion was made with a corre-
sponding level of evidence (table 5).37 39 To correct for double
evidence, RCTs that were also included in a meta-analysis or sys-
tematic review were not used separately to determine the level
of evidence of the final conclusion.
RESULTS
Study selection and methodological quality assessment
After removing doubles, the systematic literature search in
MEDLINE and the Cochrane Library provided 3713 articles

 (figure 1). After the first exclusion based on title and abstract,
101 articles were included for full-text assessment. After
reading, no study was excluded. After the hand search in the ref-
erence lists of meta-analyses and systematic reviews, eight arti-
cles were included additionally. After quality assessment, 19
RCTs were excluded based on a PEDro score of ≤4. The most
common flaws were no blinding of participants, therapists or
outcome assessors and an inadequate percentage of participants
eligible for follow-up.
All final included (n=90) articles were arranged by topic: 10 for
preoperative predictors for postoperative outcome,40–49 10 for
effectiveness of physical therapy,50–59 11 for OKC versus CKC
quadriceps exercises,60–70 21 for strength training and neuro-
muscular training,71–91 11 for electrostimulation and electro-
myographic feedback,63 93–102 5 for cryotherapy,103–107 8 for

riceps exercises’ and ‘electrostimulation’ share one systematic
review).
Data extraction
Evidence for clinical practice at all nine topics is summarised
below, according to table 5. See also online supplementary
appendix 1 for the data extraction table. Final recommendations
were made according to the EBRO criteria in table 5.
Preoperative predictors for postoperative outcome
T
en articles were found about preoperative predictors for post-
operative outcome. These were one systematic review,40 one
RCT41 and eight prospective cohort studies.42–49
The prospective cohort studies of Eitzen et al,42 Heijne
et al,44 McHugh et al47 and McHugh et al48 were included in
the systematic review of de Valk et al.40 This level A2 systematic
review documented that (1) better functional outcomes after
ACLR were achieved for men than for women at a minimum
follow-up of 1 year after ACLR, no matter the graft choice; (2)

 postoperative quadriceps strength at the moment of return to
play. Månsson et al46 (level C) found that a higher preoperative
T
egner activity level predicts a better outcome at a minimal
follow-up of 22 months. Quelard et al49 (level B) described that
a limited preoperative ROM and female sex account for a
limited ROM 3 months postoperative.
Grindem et al43 (level C prospective cohort study) and
Shaarani et al41 (level B RCT) investigated the effect of pre-
operative
rehabilitation,
so-called
prehabilitation,
on
the
outcome after ACLR. Grindem et al43 described that combined
prehabilitation and postoperative rehabilitation had better self-
reported knee function at 2-year follow-up compared to post-
operative rehabilitation only. Shaarani et al41 had a follow-up of
only 12 weeks after ACLR. They found no differences in quad-
riceps and hamstring (HS) strength between a prehabilitation
group and a group with no prehabilitation, but the prehabilia-
tion group scored better on self-reported knee function.41
From
the
above-mentioned
predictive
factors,
the
non-
modifiable factors could be taken into account by the physical
therapist to predict the outcome of treatment.
The conclusions about modifiable factors in this topic were as
follows:
▸ Level 2: a preoperative extension deficit (lack of full exten-
sion) is a major risk factor for an extension deficit after
ACLR.40 49
▸ Level 2: a preoperative deficit in quadriceps strength of
>20% has a significant negative consequence for the self-
reported outcome 2 years after ACLR.40 45
▸ Level 3: prehabilitation ensures better self-reported knee
function up to 2 years after ACLR.41 43
Effectiveness of physical therapy
T
en articles were found about the effectiveness of postoperative
physical therapy. These were three systematic reviews,50–52 five
RCTs53–57 and two prospective cohort studies.58 59
The systematic review of van Grinsven et al51 (level B)
described a time-based rehabilitation protocol based on the
available evidence supplemented with expert opinion.
The level A1 systematic review of Coppola and Collins50 inves-
tigated the effect of physical therapy after knee surgery. Based on
10 RCTs, they concluded that physical therapy is not more effect-
ive than a home exercise programme in a young and healthy
population following relatively simple knee surgery as arthro-
scopic meniscectomy. However, for rehabilitation after compli-
cated knee surgery as ACLR, there is a lack of evidence.50 The
systematic review of Wright et al52 (level A1) concluded that it is
reasonable that a minimally supervised rehabilitation can result in
successful ACLR rehabilitation. In their study, Coppola and
Collins50 included three RCTs about rehabilitation after ACLR.
Wright et al52 included the same three RCTs plus the RCT of
Beard and Dodd.53 The level B RCT of Beard and Dodd53
showed that physical therapy had minimal extra benefit in a, not
explicitly described, young athletic population after ACLR. Their
rehabilitation programme was only administered from weeks 4 to
16 after ACLR. They found no differences in self-reported knee
function
and
quadriceps and
HS strength
24 weeks
after
ACLR.53 Hohmann et al57 and Grant and Mohtadi56 (both level
B) also investigated the difference between supervised physical
therapy (Hohmann: 19 sessions, Grant and Mohtadi: 17 ses-
sions) versus home-based rehabilitation (4 sessions). They both
found no between-group differences in ROM, quadriceps and
HS strength and hop tests at >1 year follow-up,56 57 but Grant
and Mohtadi56 found a better self-reported knee function in the
home-based group. The level C prospective cohort study of
Dragicevic-Cvjetkovic et al58 found a better self-reported knee
function and greater improvement in thigh muscle circumference
in a rehabilitation group (20 weeks) compared to a group with
no rehabilitation at all at a 1 year follow-up.
Both studies of Beynnon et al54 55 (levels B and A2) studied
the difference between a 19-week and a 32-week rehabilitation
programme after ACLR. They concluded that there were no dif-
ferences in self-reported knee function, laxity, ROM, strength
and hop tests at a 2-year follow-up.54 55 The rehabilitation pro-
gramme of Muneta et al59 (level B) comprised a 6-month
rehabilitation. Their results are comparable to both studies of
Beynnon et al.54 55 59
The conclusions in this topic were as follows:
▸ Level 2: owing to a lack of high-quality studies and contra-
dictory results, it is unclear whether there is a benefit of
supervised rehabilitation compared to home-based rehabilita-
tion or no rehabilitation at all. A minimally supervised
rehabilitation programme may result in successful rehabilita-
tion in specific groups of patients that are highly motivated
and live far from a physical therapist.50 52 56 57
▸ Level 2: when comparing a 19-week with a 32-week rehabili-
tation programme, there are no differences in terms of laxity,
ROM, self-reported knee function, single-leg hop test for dis-
tance
or
isokinetic
concentric
quadriceps
and
HS
strength.54 55 59
OKC versus CKC quadriceps exercises
Concerning the OKC and CKC quadriceps exercises, 11 articles
were traced. These were four systematic reviews60–63 and seven
RCTs.64–70
Andersson et al60 conclude in their systematic review (level A1)
that after ACLR with BTPB, CKC quadriceps exercises produce
less pain, less risk of increased laxity and better self-reported knee
function compared to OKC quadriceps exercises. They included
the RCTs of Bynum et al,64 Mikkelsen et al,67 Morrissey et al68
and Perry et al.69 The recent RCTof Uçar et al70 found no differ-
ences between CKC and OKC exercises, but they investigated a
group of patients after ACLR with a HS graft.
The systematic reviews of Glass et al61 (level A1) and Wright
et al63 (level A1) conclude that OKC quadriceps exercises

 should not be used in the first 6 weeks of rehabilitation after
ACLR. Herewith, they confirmed the results of Andersson
et al.60 The RCT of Heijne and W
erner66 (level B) investigated
early (4 weeks) versus late (12 weeks) start of OKC quadriceps
exercises and compared ACLR with bone-patellar tendon-bone
(BPTB) and HS. They concluded that the HS group with an
early start had more laxity after a follow-up period of 7 months
than the other groups. Besides, an early start of OKC quadriceps
exercises had no beneficial effect on quadriceps strength.66
Fukuda et al65 (level B RCT) described that OKC quadriceps
exercises can be started from week 4 after ACLR with HS, but
in a limited ROM between 45° and 90°.
The systematic review of Lobb et al62 concluded that there is
limited evidence that a combination of OKC and CKC quadri-
ceps exercises results in better strength and return to play than
CKC exercises alone. They also included the systematic review
of Andersson et al.60 61
The overall conclusions were as follows:
▸ Level 1: CKC and OKC training can be used for regaining
quadriceps strength.61 62 70
▸ Level 2: after ACLR, OKC exercises can be performed from
week
4
postoperative
in
a
restricted
ROM
of
90–
45°.61 63 65 66
Strength training and neuromuscular training
Concerning strength training and/or neuromuscular training, 21
articles were found. Among them were 3 systematic reviews71–73
and 18 RCTs.74–91
Systematic reviews of Gokeler et al72 (level A1) and Kruse
et al73 (level A1) concluded that eccentric quadriceps training
can be safely incorporated 3 weeks after ACLR and may be the
most effective way of restoring quadriceps strength. However,
the level A1 systematic review of Augustsson71 concluded that
the strength training programmes after ACLR should be further
developed because it is still unclear what is the best way to train
the quadriceps. To optimise outcome after rehabilitation, neuro-
muscular training should be added to strength training accord-
ing to Gokeler et al72 and Kruse et al.73 Neuromuscular
training is defined as training enhancing unconscious motor
responses by stimulating afferent signals and central mechanisms
responsible for dynamic joint control.92 These exercises are
designed to induce compensatory changes in muscle activation
patterns and facilitate dynamic joint stability.92 Nine RCTs
were included in the above-mentioned systematic reviews:
Cooper et al,78 Gerber et al,80 Gerber et al,82 Risberg et al,87
Risberg and Holm,88 Sekir et al89 and Shaw et al.90 The level
B RCTs of Berschin et al,75 Bieler et al,76 Fu et al,79 Gerber
et al81 and Kinikli et al84 support the findings in those system-
atic reviews.
The level B RCTs of Isberg et al83 and Shaw et al90 concluded
that isometric quadriceps exercises are safe in the first post-
operative weeks, because there are no differences in laxity up to
2 years of follow-up.
Baltaci et al74 (level B RCT) and Cappellino et al77 (level B
RCT) demonstrated that the use of Wii Fit, respectively, neuro-
cognitive rehabilitation have no beneficial effect to a combined
strength
and
neuromuscular
rehabilitation
at
a
short-term
follow-up.
T
yler et al91 (level B RCT) concluded that immediate weight
bearing had no detrimental effects for laxity and a positive
effect on anterior knee pain at a 1-year follow-up.
The main conclusions were as follows:
▸ Level 1: starting eccentric quadriceps training (in CKC) from
3 weeks after ACLR is safe and contributes to a bigger
improvement
in
quadriceps
strength
than
concentric
training.72 73 76 81 84
▸ Level 1: neuromuscular training should be added to strength
training
to
optimise
self-reported
outcome
measurements.72 73 75 79
▸ Level 2: isometric quadriceps exercises are safe from the first
postoperative week.83 90
▸ Level 3: immediate weight bearing does not affect knee
laxity and results in decreased incidence of anterior knee
pain.91
Electrostimulation and electromyographic feedback
Eleven articles about electrostimulation and electromyographic
feedback were found. These were four systematic reviews,63 93–95
six RCTs96–101 and one prospective cohort study.102
Imoto et al93 and Kim et al94 (level A1 systematic reviews) con-
cluded that the addition of electrostimulation to conventional
rehabilitation might be more effective in improving quadriceps
strength up to 2 months after ACLR. The level A2 RCT of
Paternostro-Sluga
et
al100
and
the
level
B
RCT
of
Fitzgerald et al99 were included in both systematic reviews.
Ediz et al97 (level B RCT) and Lepley et al102 (level C prospective
cohort study) found no differences in effusion, pain, ROM and
knee extension and flexion moments when electrostimulation
was added to conventional rehabilitation. Feil et al98 and
Taradaj et al101 (both level B RCTs) did examine quadriceps
strength and found a higher increase in quadriceps strength when
electrostimulation was added to conventional rehabilitation at a
6-month follow-up. Wright et al63 (level A1 systematic review)
summarised that electrostimulation may help improve quadriceps
strength in the early postoperative period, but that it is not a
prerequisite for successful rehabilitation. All authors did not dis-
tinguish
between
regaining
quadriceps
motor control
and
increasing quadriceps strength.
Studies concerning electromyographic feedback are contra-
dictory. The systematic review of W
asielewski et al95 (level A1)
showed that electromyographic feedback improves short-term
postsurgical pain after ACLR, but Christanell et al96 (level B
RCT) described no differences in pain during the first six post-
operative weeks with or without biofeedback.
The conclusions on this topic were as follows:
▸ Level 1: electrostimulation, in combination with conven-
tional rehabilitation, might be more effective for improving
muscle strength for up to 2 months after ACLR than conven-
tional rehabilitation alone. However, its effect on long-term
functional performance and self-reported knee function is
inconclusive.63 93 94 98 101
▸ Level 2: electromyographic feedback might improve short-
term postsurgical pain after ACLR.95 96
Cryotherapy
Five
articles
were
found
about
cryotherapy:
two
meta-analyses,103 104 one systematic review,105 one RCT106 and
one prospective cohort study.107
All three level A1 articles shared the conclusion that cryother-
apy is effective in reducing postoperative pain until about
1 week postsurgery, but it has no effect on drainage or
ROM.103–105 The level A2 RCT of Edwards et al106 was
included in the meta-analyses of Martimbianco et al.103 The
prospective cohort study of Glenn et al107 (level C) supports
these findings.
The conclusion on this topic was as follows:
▸ Level 1: cryotherapy is effective in decreasing pain imme-
diately after application up to 1 week postsurgery after

Measurements of functional performance
Eight articles about measurements of functional performance
were traced: six systematic reviews23 27 28 108–110 and two pro-
spective cohort studies.111 112
Five systematic reviews (all level B) concluded that there is a
lack
of
objective
criteria
to
determine
return
to
play.23
27
28
109
110 Extensive test batteries for determining
quantity and quality of movement are recommended, including
strength tests, hop tests and video analysis for measuring quality
of movement.27 28
There is weak evidence from a level A2 systematic review for
factors that could be associated with a higher chance of return
to play: less effusion, less pain, higher quadriceps strength,
greater tibial rotation, higher Marx Scale score, higher athletic
confidence, higher preoperative knee self-efficacy, lower kinesio-
phobia
and
higher
preoperative
self-motivation.108
Müller
et al111 (level B prospective cohort study) added better self-
reported knee function and better hop test performance to this
list.
Thomeé et al112 (level B prospective cohort study) described
that there were poor results at 2 years after ACLR when testing
leg muscle power and hop performance and applying an Limb
Symmetry Index (LSI) of >90% to all six tests. Only 23% of
patients passed when using these criteria and only 10% passed
when an LSI of 95% was used.112
The overall conclusions were as follows:
▸ Level 2: an extensive test battery should be used for deter-
mining the moment for return to play, but there are no tests
or test batteries that have been tested for construct or pre-
dictive validity for return to play.23 27 28 108–111
▸ Level 3: It is not clear which cut-off point of the LSI should
be used for strength and hop tests.112
Return to play
T
en
articles
were
traced
about
return
to
play:
two
meta-analyses,13 14 two systematic reviews113 114 and six pro-
spective cohort studies.17 22 115–118
The meta-analysis of Ardern et al13 (level A2) included their
earlier meta-analysis14 and the prospective cohort studies of
Brophy et al,17 Gobbi and Francisco115 and Langford et al.22
They found that 65% of patients after ACLR returned to prein-
jury competitive sport level within 2 years, but only 38%
remained at the same level >2 years after ACLR. Men were 1.4
times more likely to return to their preinjury sport level than
women,
and
BPTB
was
1.2
times
more
likely
than
HS.13 14 17 22 115 Laboute et al116 (level C prospective cohort
study) reported 65.7% of athletes returning to preinjury sport
level, while Zaffagnini et al118 reported a higher return to pre-
injury sport level of 71% in a group of professional soccer
players 4 years after ACLR.
Several psychological factors have influence on the rehabilita-
tion process and return to play. According to the systematic
reviews of Everhart et al113 (level A2) and te Wierike et al114
(level B), a high self-efficacy, a high internal locus of control and
a low level of fear are associated with a higher chance of return
to play. They included the prospective cohort studies of Gobbi
and Francisco,115 Langford et al22 and Thomeé et al.117
The literature concluded that:
▸ Level 1: the rate of return to preinjury play level for (non-
professional) pivoting athletes after ACLR is 65%.13 116
▸ Level 2: Psychological factors as self-efficacy, locus of control
and fear of reinjury have influence on the rehabilitation
process and return to play after ACLR.113 114
Risk of reinjuries
Five articles about risk of reinjuries were found. These were two
systematic
reviews119
120
and
three
prospective
cohort
studies.29 35 36
The systematic reviews of Swärd et al119 and Wright et al120
(both level B) concluded that the risk of a contralateral ACL
injury is higher than the risk of a first-time ACL rupture or an
ACL graft rerupture. The level B prospective cohort study of
Wright et al29 was included in both systematic reviews.
The level B prospective cohort studies of Hewett et al35 and
Paterno et al36 support the conclusions of the systematic review of
Swärd et al119 that altered neuromuscular function and biomech-
anics could be responsible for the risk of second ACL rupture
(graft rerupture and contralateral ACL). Factors contributing could
be greater hip internal rotation, the occurrence of dynamic knee
valgus or less knee flexion when landing from a jump.35 36 119
Their conclusions were as follows:
▸ Level 2: the risk of a contralateral ACL rupture (>10%) is
higher than the risk of graft rerupture (about 5%) (up to
10 years after ACLR) or first-time ACL rupture.119 120
▸ Level 2: altered neuromuscular function and biomechanics
(greater hip internal rotation, the occurrence of dynamic
knee valgus or less knee flexion during landing) after ACLR
could be a risk factor for second ACL injury (graft rerupture
or contralateral rupture).35 36 119
CONSENSUS CONCLUSION
Although there are many articles published about ACL rehabili-
tation, there is limited evidence for parameters that influence or
predict the final result of ACLR rehabilitation and return to
play. The aim of this study was to describe the process in which
the KNGF evidence statement for ACL rehabilitation was devel-
oped and to present this practice guideline (see online supple-
mentary appendix 2). The goal of the evidence statement was to
describe the rehabilitation after ACLR with BPTB or HS auto-
graft and to encourage uniformity in physical therapy treatment
and the use of measurements of functional performance. The
evidence statement is aimed to fill a gap between evidence and
clinical practice and describes a complete protocol to rehabili-
tate an athlete after ACLR. The multidisciplinary approval of
this evidence statement underlines the importance of a close col-
laboration between different professions.
Despite the fact that our evidence statement is based on infor-
mation from RCTs and systematic reviews from the two most
important databases, the evidence is inconclusive. Owing to this
lack of scientific evidence, available background literature and a
steering group consisting of ACL experts were used to develop a
multidisciplinary consensus statement for an ACLR rehabilita-
tion protocol. This consensus statement was based on three for-
mulated questions with the following conclusions.
What should be the content of the rehabilitation protocol
after ACLR?
The description of the rehabilitation protocol is divided into
preoperative and postoperative rehabilitation.
Preoperative rehabilitation
Preoperative rehabilitation, also known as prehabilitation, is not
usually prescribed by orthopaedic surgeons (or trauma surgeons)
in the Netherlands. Previous studies showed that a preoperative

 full extension ROM reduces the chance for postoperative com-
plications as arthrofibrosis.46 48 Moreover, a deficit in quadri-
ceps strength of 20% or more predicts a significant strength
deficit until 2 years after ACLR (level 2).41 121 Therefore, the
steering group recommends to measure the preoperative ROM
and quadriceps strength as part of the preoperative rehabilita-
tion protocol. The steering group also advises to measure HS
strength, although there is no recommendation for HS measure-
ment in literature. Yet, there are studies that conclude that HS
strength in the operated leg is still reduced compared to the
non-operated leg until 2 years after ACLR.121 For this examin-
ation and possible treatment, the patient could be referred to a
physical therapist to prevent a complicated or prolonged
rehabilitation.
Preoperative information about walking with crutches, the
early postoperative exercises and the rehabilitation process may
improve a patients’ self-efficacy; thus, the steering group advises
to discuss these topics with patients (level 4). See also table 6
for a summary of conclusions and recommendations.
Postoperative rehabilitation
Good communication between the surgeon and physical therap-
ist is of great importance. While the orthopaedic surgeon is
responsible for the surgery results and techniques, the physical
therapist should be leading in decision-making in rehabilitation.
Therefore, the steering group advises that the orthopaedic
surgeon (or trauma surgeon) informs the physical therapist
about
perioperative
findings:

Summary of conclusions and recommendations
Conclusions and recommendations
Level of
evidence
Preoperative rehabilitation
A preoperative extension deficit (lack of full extension) is a major risk factor for an extension deficit after ACLR
2
Recommendation: measure the preoperative ROM
A preoperative deficit in quadriceps strength of >20% has a significant negative consequence for the self-reported outcome 2 years after ACLR
2
Recommendation: measure quadriceps strength and also HS strength
Prehabilitation ensures better self-reported knee function up to 2 years after ACLR
3
Recommendation: refer the patient to a physical therapist when necessary
Postoperative rehabilitation
It is unclear whether there is a benefit of supervised rehabilitation compared to home-based rehabilitation or no rehabilitation at all. A minimally supervised
rehabilitation programme may result in successful rehabilitation in specific groups of patients that are highly motivated and live far from a physical therapist
2
When comparing a 19-week with a 32-week rehabilitation programme, there are no differences in terms of laxity, ROM, self-reported knee function, single-leg
hop test for distance or isokinetic concentric quadriceps and HS strength
2
Recommendation: continue rehabilitation for 9–12 months, depending on the final return-to-work or play goals of the patient
Immediate weight bearing does not affect knee laxity and results in decreased incidence of anterior knee pain
2
Recommendation: immediate weight bearing should only be tolerated if there is a correct gait pattern (if necessary with crutches) and no pain, effusion or increase in
temperature when walking or shortly after walking
Cryotherapy is effective in decreasing pain immediately after application up to 1 week postsurgery after ACLR, but has no effect on postoperative drainage or
ROM
1
Recommendation: cryotherapy could eventually be applied in the first postoperative week to reduce pain
Isometric quadriceps exercises are safe from the first postoperative week
2
Recommendation: start isometric quadriceps exercises in this first week for reactivating the quadriceps muscles when they provoke no pain
Electrostimulation, in combination with conventional rehabilitation, might be more effective for improving muscle strength for up to 2 months after ACLR than conventional
rehabilitation alone. However, its effect on long-term functional performance and self-reported knee function is inconclusive.
Recommendation: electrostimulation can be useful as an addition to isometric strength training for re-educating voluntary contraction of the quadriceps muscles
during the first postoperative weeks
1
CKC and OKC training can be used for regaining quadriceps strength
1
After ACLR, OKC exercises can be performed from week 4 postoperative in a restricted ROM of 90–45°
Recommendation: When the quadriceps is reactivated, concentric and eccentric exercises should be used to replace the isometric exercises, provided that the
knee does not react with effusion or (an increase in) pain. CKC exercises can be performed from week 2 postoperative. For BPTB, OKC exercises can be started
from 4 weeks postoperative in a restricted ROM of 90–45° and extra resistance is allowed, for example, at a leg extension machine. For HS, OKC exercises also
can be started from 4 weeks postoperative in a restricted ROM of 90–45°, but no extra weight should be added in the first 12 weeks to prevent graft elongation.
ROM can be increased to 90–30° in week 5, to 90–20° in week 6, to 90–10° in week 7 and to full ROM in week 8 for both graft types
2
Neuromuscular training should be added to strength training to optimise self-reported outcome measurements
1
Altered neuromuscular function and biomechanics after ACLR could be a risk factor for second ACL injury (graft rerupture or contralateral rupture)
2
Recommendation: neuromuscular training should be added to strength training. Pay attention to a correct quality of movement for prevention of reinjuries
Psychological factors as self-efficacy, locus of control and fear of reinjury have influence on the rehabilitation process and return to play after ACLR
2
Recommendation: evaluate psychological changes during rehabilitation with an objective instrument
Criteria for return to play
2
An extensive test battery should be used to determine the return-to-play moment, but there are no tests or test batteries that have been tested for construct or
predictive validity for return to play
2
It is not clear which cut-off point of the LSI should be used for strength and hop tests
3
Recommendation: perform an extensive test battery for quantity and quality of movement. This test battery should include at least a strength test battery and a hop test
battery and measurement of quality of movement. An LSI of >90% could be used as a cut-off point. For pivoting/contact sports, an LSI of �100% is recommended
ACLR, anterior cruciate ligament reconstruction; BPTB, bone-patellar tendon-bone; CKC, closed kinetic chain; HS, hamstring; LSI, Limb Symmetry Index; OKC, open kinetic chain; ROM,

 meniscus repair, cartilage damage (location, size and grade),
ligamentous injuries or complications during surgery. Also,
when possible in his setting, the physical therapist should
inform the surgeon about the current status of the patient pre-
ceding
to
every
preoperative
or
postoperative
outpatient
appointment, to ensure that appropriate levels of stress are
being applied to the healing tissues.122
During the first meeting of the working and steering group, it
was decided to define different phases during rehabilitation
after ACLR. Current literature describes time-based rehabilita-
tion protocols that are mainly based on the remodelling process
of the graft.51 Since there is still uncertainty about the time
schedule of the human remodelling process, it makes more
sense to incorporate functional goal-based criteria to the
rehabilitation protocol.123–126 Besides, there are individual dif-
ferences in neuromotor learning and flexibility after ACLR.
These underline the importance of a shift from time-based
rehabilitation to goal-based rehabilitation with neuromuscular
goals and criteria to manage the rehabilitation process. These
goals for progression to the next phase and description of inter-
ventions during each phase are based on the International
Classification of Functioning, Disability and Health (WHO
2001). Our evidence statement consists of three phases (see
online supplementary appendix 2) with a goal-based progres-
sion: the so-called traffic-light method of progression through
phases. This is relatively new in rehabilitation, but it assures a
more patient-tailored rehabilitation.118
127 Patients can start
with the next phase only if specific goals of the previous phase
are achieved and these should be confirmed with objective tests
(see online supplementary appendix 2 for criteria).
The steering group advises to start rehabilitation immediate
after
ACLR
and
continue
rehabilitation
for
9–12 months,
depending on the final return-to-work or play goals of the
patient.128 This rehabilitation period is necessary to allow
return to high-intensity sport or physically demanding work.
This term differs from a previous ACLR rehabilitation protocol
by van Grinsven et al,51 who presented a 22-week rehabilitation
with four time-based phases. Recent evidence suggests that
longer rehabilitation periods are needed, because most patients
are not able to reach the end-rehabilitation goals in 22
weeks.129 130 Herbst et al131 presented a new functional per-
formance test battery and concluded that most patients were not
ready for return to play even at 8 months after ACLR. Others
suggest that home-based rehabilitation is as effective as super-
vised rehabilitation.53
56
57 These home-based rehabilitation
programmes are designed in countries where patients live too
far from a physical therapist to schedule a visit a few times in a
week. Important to mention is that these programmes are not
designed for patients who perform high-intensity sports. Still,
there is no evidence which rehabilitation period or how many
appointments per week works best for return to play.
During postoperative rehabilitation, a physical therapist can
use several treatment modalities, of which some are proven to
be effective in literature and some are not (table 6). It is known
that immediate weight bearing is safe (level 3).91 The steering
group recommends that immediate weight bearing should only
be tolerated if there is a correct gait pattern (if necessary with
crutches) and no pain, effusion or increase in temperature when
walking or shortly after walking. Cryotherapy could eventually
be applied in the first postoperative week to reduce pain (level
1).103–107 The steering group suggests to start isometric quadri-
ceps exercises in this first week for reactivating the quadriceps
muscles when they provoke no pain (level 2).83 90 In addition,
electrostimulation can be useful for re-educating voluntary con-
traction of the quadriceps muscles during the first postoperative
weeks (level 1).63 93 94 98–101 When the quadriceps is reacti-
vated, concentric and subsequently eccentric exercises should be
used to replace the isometric exercises, provided that the knee
does not react with effusion or (an increase in) pain. Quadriceps
strength
training
can
be
performed
in
CKC
and
OKC.
Concentric CKC exercises can be performed from week 2 post-
operative. For OKC exercises, there should be a distinction
between ACLR with a BPTB graft or a HS graft. For BPTB,
OKC exercises can be started from 4 weeks postoperative in a
restricted ROM of 90–45° and extra resistance is allowed, for
example, at a leg extension machine (level 2). For HS, OKC
exercises can also be started from 4 weeks postoperative in a
restricted ROM of 90–45°, but no extra weight should be added
in the first 12 weeks to prevent graft elongation (level 2).65 66
ROM can be increased to 90–30° in week 5, to 90–20° in week
6, to 90–10° in week 7 and to full ROM in week 8 for both
graft types.51 The steering group strongly advises that neuro-
muscular training should be added to strength training to opti-
mise outcome measurements (level 1).72 73 75 78 79 85 87–90
In literature about rehabilitation after ACLR, there is a lack of
focus on the evaluation and training of the quality of movement
as measurement of neuromuscular recovery. The relevance to
focus more on the quality of movement is underlined by the
fact that altered neuromuscular function and biomechanics after
ACLR could be a risk factor for a second ACL injury (level
2).35 36 119 An improvement in quality of movement can be
observed as an effect of motor learning. In the early phases of
rehabilitation, mostly explicit motor learning is necessary, but
we advocate that in the late phase of rehabilitation, more impli-
cit motor learning strategies should be used.132 This is because
implicit learning may produce more stable solutions under
stress, anxiety-provoking conditions and fatigue states, especially
necessary in sports.130
Which measurements and assessments can be applied to
monitor progression during the rehabilitation programme
and to determine outcomes at the end of rehabilitation
programme?
There are no clear recommendations regarding the use of mea-
surements for quantity (eg, strength and hop performance) and
quality of movement during the postoperative rehabilitation
process. The criteria to progress from phase 1 to phase 2 or
from phase 2 to phase 3 are based on expert opinion (see online
supplementary appendix 2). Besides the quantity and quality of
movement, it is important to evaluate psychological changes
during rehabilitation with an objective instrument, for example,
with the Marx Scale, the Psychovitality Scale or the Knee
Self-Efficacy Scale (level 2).22 108 113–115 117
What criteria should be used to determine the moment of
return to play?
All included systematic reviews about measurements of func-
tional performance have the same conclusion: studies are
lacking objective physiological criteria at what time after ACLR
return to play is allowed.27 31 32 108–110 There is also no conclu-
sive evidence that any test or test battery can accurately identify
athletes at high risk of reinjury. Therefore, the steering group
recommends to perform an extensive test battery for quantity
and quality of movement (level 2).27 31 32 108–111 This test
battery should include at least a strength test battery and a hop
test battery and measurement of quality of movement for

 determining the moment for return to play. An LSI of >90%
could be used as a cut-off point. For pivoting/contact sports, an
LSI of �100% is recommended (see online supplementary
appendix 2).133 Qualitative scoring systems as the Jump Landing
System and Landing Error Scoring System have been developed
in the past few years, but it is still unclear in which manner
quality of movement plays a role in the occurrence of ACL rein-
juries.134–138 Therefore, prospective studies are needed to evalu-
ate
whether
these
scoring
systems
are
able
to
measure
neuromotor control and to investigate the predictive validity of
those qualitative scoring systems.
LIMITATIONS
Meta-analyses and systematic reviews were included in this
study. A strength is the additional weight in evidence, but a limi-
tation is that the included meta-analyses and systematic reviews
may have used other inclusion and exclusion criteria than the
ones used in this study. The main discrepancy is that they did
not mention the graft choice or brace-free rehabilitation in their
information.
W
e
accept
this
limitation
because
many
meta-analyses and systematic reviews are written about rehabili-
tation after ACLR and they comprise the highest level of evi-
dence. In most cases, they give useful advice for day-to-day
clinical practice and add value to the included RCTs and pro-
spective cohort studies.
Despite the extensive literature search, our recommenda-
tions are lacking a certain specificity regarding sets, repetitions
and resistance used in exercises. This is because included
studies are vague in describing these parameters. However, it
is extremely difficult to describe this for a population of
patients, because these parameters depend on pain, effu-
sion and level of the patient (eg, concerning type of sport and
experience with strength training). We expect that every sports
physical therapist is able to address the correct parameters to
his individual patient, but suggest that more research is needed
on this topic.
What are the findings?
▸ Rehabilitation after anterior cruciate ligament reconstruction
should consist of three phases, which are goal-based rather
than time-based. The goals for progression to the next
phase and description of interventions during each phase
should be based on the International Classification of
Functioning, Disability and Health.
▸ An extensive test battery, including at least a strength test
battery, a hop test battery and measurement of quality of
movement, is needed to determine the moment of return to play.
How might it impact on clinical practice in the future?
▸ Thirty-five per cent of athletes after anterior cruciate
ligament reconstruction (ACLR) do not return to preinjury
sport level within 2 years.
▸ Closed and open kinetic chain quadriceps training can be
used for regaining strength, but neuromuscular training
should be added to strength training to optimise outcome
measurements after ACLR.
▸ Movement quality may affect the ACL (re)injury rate.
