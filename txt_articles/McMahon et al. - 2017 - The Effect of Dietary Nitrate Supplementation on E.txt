Key Points 
Findings from this meta-analysis highlight the positive ergogenic effect of dietary nitrate supplementation on endurance 
exercise capacity. 
Further randomised controlled trials are required to determine the true ergogenic effect of dietary nitrate supplementation on 
exercise performance. 
Abstract 
 
BACKGROUND: Recent research into the use of dietary nitrates and their role in vascular function has led to it becoming 
progressively more popular amongst athletes attempting to enhance performance. OBJECTIVE: The objective of this review 
was to perform a systematic review and meta-analysis of the literature to evaluate the effect of dietary nitrate (NO3-) 
supplementation on endurance exercise performance. An additional aim was to determine whether the performance outcomes 
are affected by potential moderator variables. DATA SOURCES: Relevant databases such as Cochrane Library, Embase, 
PubMed, Ovid, Scopus and Web of Science were searched for the following search terms ‘nitrates OR nitrate OR beetroot OR 
table beet OR garden beet OR red beet AND exercise AND performance’ from inception to October 2015. STUDY SELECTION: 
Studies were included if a placebo versus dietary nitrate-only supplementation protocol was able to be compared, and if a 
quantifiable measure of exercise performance was ≥ 30 seconds (for a single bout of exercise or the combined total for multiple 
bouts). STUDY APPRAISAL AND SYNTHESIS: The literature search identified 1038 studies, with 47 (76 trials) meeting the 
inclusion criteria. Data from the 76 trials was extracted for inclusion in the meta-analysis. A random-effects meta-analysis was 
conducted for time trial (TT) (n = 28), time to exhaustion (TTE) (n = 22), and graded-exercise test (GXT) (n = 8) protocols. 
Univariate meta-regression was used to assess potential moderator variables (exercise type, dose duration, NO3- type, study 
quality, fitness level, and percentage nitrite change). RESULTS: Pooled analysis identified a trivial, but non-significant effect in 
favour of dietary NO3- supplementation (effect size (ES) = -0.10, 95% Cl = -0.27-0.06, p > 0.05). TTE trials had a small to moderate 
statistically significant effect in favour of dietary NO3- supplementation (ES = 0.33, 95% Cl = 0.15-0.50, p < 0.01).  GXT trials had a 
small, but non-significant effect in favour of dietary NO3- supplementation in GXT performance measures (ES = 0.25, 95% Cl = -
0.06-0.56, p > 0.05).  
No significant heterogeneity was detected in the meta-analysis. No statistically significant effects were observed from the meta-
regression analysis. CONCLUSION: Dietary NO3- supplementation is likely to elicit a positive outcome when testing endurance 
exercise capacity; whereas, dietary NO3- supplementation is less likely to be effective for time-trial performance. Further work is 
needed to understand the optimal dosing strategies, which population is most likely to benefit, and under which conditions 
dietary nitrates are likely to be most effective for performance. 
 
 1. Introduction 
Through dietary manipulation, a number of different macronutrient and micronutrients have been identified as having the 
capacity to enhance exercise performance [1]. These nutritional ergogenic aids allow athletes to reach beyond the abilities 
achieved from training alone, and could be the difference between victory or defeat. For this reason, exploring and evaluating 
the efficacy of nutritional ergogenic aids is a valuable process to undertake [2]. Recent research into the use of dietary nitrates 
and their role in vascular function has led to it becoming progressively more popular amongst athletes attempting to enhance 
performance. Other physiological processes that might be altered to provide an ergogenic effect due to nitrate ingestion include 
skeletal muscle contractility and mitochondrial efficiency, glucose homeostasis, and respiration [3]. 
Green leafy and root vegetables constitute the primary dietary source of nitrate (NO3-). Vegetables with a very high 
NO3- concentration (> 250mg/100g) include spinach, rocket, cress, lettuce, celery, radish, Swiss chard, chervil, and red beetroot 
[4]. Once ingested, dietary NO3- is reduced to nitric oxide (NO) via the NO3--nitrite-NO pathway, increasing the level of NO in the 
blood and tissues [5]. NO is a potent signalling molecule that plays a key role in vasodilation by relaxing smooth muscle and 
subsequently improving blood circulation.  
The first study to observe the benefits of dietary NO3- ingestion on exercise was performed by Larsen et al. [6]. The 
randomised double-blind placebo-controlled crossover study involved nine, well-trained male subjects performing progressive 
work rate cycling after chronic sodium NO3- supplementation (0.1 mmol∙kg-1/day for three days). NO3- ingestion resulted in a 
significantly lower oxygen (O2) cost of exercise at work rates ranging from 45-80% peak oxygen uptake (𝑉̇ O2peak), without an 
increase in blood lactate concentration, resulting in enhanced exercise efficiency.  The amount of NO3- supplemented by Larsen 
et al. [6] resembled the amount found in 150 - 250g of NO3--rich vegetables. Their findings were unexpected because it is 
generally considered that the O2 cost of exercise at a given work rate was a fixed quantity among individuals, particularly during 
cycling [7, 8]. 
The observation by Larsen et al. [6] instigated further studies investigating the effect of dietary NO3- supplementation 
on exercise performance. Reported physiological changes include reduced blood pressure [9, 10], enhanced muscle 
deoxyhemoglobin kinetics [11], reduced adenosine triphosphate (ATP) utilisation and phosphocreatine (PCr) degradation 
resulting in enhanced muscle contractile efficiency [9], reduced O2 cost of submaximal exercise [12-14], and improved exercise 
performance [15, 9, 16, 12]. However, a number of studies have found dietary NO3- supplementation to have no effect on 
performance [17-22]. The variability in findings may be due to different study designs, protocols, or participant characteristics 
but this has not been systematically evaluated.  
A previous systematic review and meta-analysis conducted in 2013  examined the effects of dietary NO3- 
supplementation on endurance exercise performance [23]. After examining 17 studies, the meta-analysis concluded that dietary 
NO3- supplementation had a minor benefit on time trial (TT) performance (ES = 0.11, p > 0.05, n = 9); moderate effect on time to 
 exhaustion (TTE) trials (ES = 0.79, p < 0.01, n = 3); and a slight benefit on graded-exercise test (GXT) performance (ES = 0.23, p > 
0.05, n = 7). Due to the small number of studies, Hoon et al. [23] concluded that more research was necessary to determine the 
overall effect of dietary NO3- supplementation on endurance performance.  
The purpose of this systematic review and meta-analysis was to update, critically evaluate, and summarise the 
methodological quality of the literature on dietary NO3- supplementation and endurance exercise performance. A secondary aim 
was to determine whether the performance outcomes are affected by potential moderator variables such as exercise type and 
duration, protocol, dose duration and amount, NO3- type, subject’s level of fitness, and change in nitrite (NO2-). The results may 
help to further our understanding of the influence dietary NO3- supplementation has on performance, with the purpose of 
providing clear usage recommendations to augment participant performance. 
 
2. Methods 
We conducted and reported this systematic review in accordance with the guidelines outlined in the PRISMA (Preferred 
Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses) statement [24].  
2.1 Search strategy  
The following databases were systematically searched, and limited to English language:  Cochrane Library, Embase, PubMed, 
Ovid, Scopus and Web of Science, from inception to October 2015. The following search terms and Medical Subject Headings 
(MeSH) were used to source pertinent peer-reviewed journals: nitrates (MeSH) OR nitrates (All Fields) OR nitrate (All Fields) OR 
beetroot (All Fields) OR table beet (All Fields) OR garden beet (All Fields) OR red beet (All Fields) AND exercise (MeSH) OR 
exercise (All Fields) AND performance (All Fields). The search was supplemented by manually cross-matching reference lists, key 
author searches, and citation searching of all retrieved papers to potentially identify additional studies.  
 
2.2 Inclusion and Exclusion Criteria 
Selection criteria for all relevant articles was determined by two researchers (NM and ML). Only full-text primary source articles 
published in peer-reviewed journals utilising a randomised placebo-controlled crossover design were included. Other specific 
eligibility criteria were: (i) participants had to be healthy, human adolescents or adults (age ≥ 16 years); (ii) studies had to 
evaluate dietary NO3- supplementation such as nitrate-rich vegetable sources or beetroot juice; (iii) studies evaluating multiple 
supplements were included only if the placebo vs. nitrate-only supplementation protocol was able to be compared; (iv) studies 
had to include an outcome of a quantifiable measure of exercise performance lasting ≥ 30 seconds (for a single bout of exercise 
or the combined total for multiple bouts). 
2.3 Data Extraction and Analysis 
 Two researchers (NM and ML) independently assessed the retrieved title and abstract with clearly irrelevant studies excluded. 
Full papers of abstracts potentially eligible for inclusion were then screened (NM and ML). Differences in opinion were resolved 
through discussion and consensus with a third reviewer (TP).  
 
2.4 Data Extraction 
Data was extracted using a standardised form. The primary outcome measures in this review were changes in exercise 
performance after dietary NO3- supplementation. Data on participant characteristics (sex, age, training status, and maximal rate 
of oxygen uptake (𝑽
̇ O2max/peak - when reported), intervention protocol (dose and delivery method), study methodology, exercise 
protocol (type, duration and exercise assessment), percentage difference between NO3- and placebo, significant performance 
effect, and trial results were extracted systematically by one researcher (NM) and substantiated by a second (ML). The effect of 
dietary NO3- supplementation was calculated at the end of the exercise assessment, as [(meannitrate – meanplacebo) ÷ meanplacebo x 
100]. If a study included an additional NO3- protocol or exercise assessment it was extracted separately and included as another 
trial. A time trial was defined as a timed race over a specified course or distance. A time to exhaustion trial was defined as a 
single step increment in work rate that is continued until exhaustion. A graded-exercise performance test was defined as a 
multiple step or continuous ramp incremental test until exhaustion.  
 
2.5 Quality assessment 
The studies were assessed for quality using the Physiotherapy Evidence Database (PEDro) scale [25]. PEDro scale items and 
operational definitions of each item are given in the Electronic Supplementary Material Appendix S1. The PEDro scale was used 
because of its ability to objectively and reliably assess a randomised controlled trial’s (RCT) internal validity [25]. Each article was 
independently analysed by two reviewers (NM and ML) using the 11-item checklist to yield a maximum score of 10. The kappa 
value signifying the level of agreement between reviewers was k = 0.94. Differences in opinion concerning the scoring of an 
article were settled via discussion with a third reviewer (TP). 
 
2.6 Statistical analysis  
Data synthesis was descriptive, with detailed tabular summaries presented. For the primary outcomes of TT performance (n = 
28), TTE (n = 22), and GXT (n = 8), we were able to consistently extract data across studies to allow a quantitative summary using 
a meta-analysis (where the performance outcome could be measured in seconds). Trials that could not be measured in seconds 
were excluded from the meta-analysis due to the quantitative differences [6, 10, 14, 32, 41, 49, 53, 55, 70]. Despite the 
difference in physiological stressors between the hypoxic and normoxic trials, a sub-analysis was not undertaken due to the 
 small number of hypoxic trials (n = 6; TT = 3, TTE = 3). We compared absolute changes and calculated a standardised mean 
difference (95% confidence intervals) for each study.  
Heterogeneity was investigated by reviewing study populations, methods, and interventions, and by using the χ2 test 
for homogeneity and the I2 statistic. A random effects model for the meta-analysis was used unless statistical heterogeneity was 
identified (χ2 test, p ≤ 0.05, or I2 ≥ 50%). The random effects model was applied because of the considerable variability in several 
experimental factors (e.g., test and dose duration, dose amount) across trials. However, random and fixed effects models 
produced the same results. Hedges’ g was used to determine potential bias due to the reasonably small sample sizes prevalent 
across the studies [26]. Effect sizes were interpreted using Cohen’s definitions of trivial (< 0.2), small (0.2-0.3), moderate (0.5) 
and large (> 0.8) [27]. Analysis was conducted using Review Manager 5.0 (Nordic Cochrane Centre, Copenhagen, Denmark). 
The level of agreement between reviewers evaluating the study quality was assessed using Cohen’s kappa statistics 
using SPSS for Windows, Version 23.0 (Armonk, NY: IBM Corp.). The kappa values were interpreted using the ranges suggested 
by Landis and Koch [28] of < 0.00 = poor, 0.00 – 0.20 = slight, 0.21 – 0.40 = fair, 0.41 – 0.60 = moderate, 0.61 – 0.80 = substantial, 
0.81 – 1.00 = almost perfect.  
Eight trial features were identified as potential moderator variables. The analysis included dichotomous data of exercise 
type (cycling or other), test duration (≥ 10 mins or < 10 mins), dose duration (acute (< 6 hours) or chronic (repeated doses ≥ 6 
hours apart)), NO3- type (beetroot juice or other), NO3- dose (< 6.5 mmol or ≥ 6.5 mmol), and study quality (< 9 or ≥ 9 (assessed 
using the PEDro scale)). Fitness level (𝑉̇ O2max) and percentage nitrite change were analysed using continuous data. Univariate 
meta-regression was used to assess the association between each potential moderating variable and TT and TTE performance 
outcomes.  Univariate meta-regression was not used for trials utilising graded-exercise performance tests as there were fewer 
than 10 studies. 
As outcomes were continuous, we assessed for publication bias using Egger’s test and by visual inspection of funnel 
plots, with a p-value of > 0.10 considered statistically significant (publication bias was not assessed for the GXT, for which there 
were fewer than 10 studies) [29, 30]. 
 
3. Results 
The bibliographic search yielded 1,038 articles (Figure 1) for preliminary screening of titles and abstracts, with 62 full-text 
articles retrieved, and 47 identified as meeting the inclusion criteria.

3.1 Study characteristics 
The characteristics of each study and the physiological changes are summarised in Table 1. Multiple studies utilised 
more than one category of participants: dose-response trials [31-33]; different distances [16]; different exercise intensities [34-
37]; acute (< 6 hours) or chronic (repeated doses ≥ 6 hours apart) [22, 10]; hypoxia vs normoxia [38, 39]; sex [40, 41]; different 
exercise protocols [42]; or level of fitness [14]. Consequently, these studies were reported as two or more trials, raising the total 
number of cross-over trials to 76 across 47 publications, each with a NO3- and placebo condition.  
The studies were published between 2007 [6] and 2015 [43]. Three types of performance assessments were utilised 
across the studies, with 38 examining the effect of dietary NO3- supplementation vs. placebo on exercise time/distance (TT – 
summarised in Table 1), 22 trials using a TTE protocol (TTE – summarised in Table 2), and 16 included a graded-exercise 
performance test (GXT – summarised in Table 3). Sixty-one trials showed improved performance after dietary NO3- 
supplementation, 29 of which were statistically significant (p < 0.05), and in one study, decreased performance was observed 
 following NO3- supplementation [44]. Following dietary NO3- supplementation, 20 of the 22 TTE trials showed a mean 
improvement in performance (16 of which showed significant improvements), as did 27 of the 38 TTs and 14 of the 16 GXTs (of 
which 7 and 5 were significant improvements, respectively). 
 
Cycling was the most common method of exercise, utilised in 44 of the 76 trials. Fourteen opted for treadmill running 
[14, 18, 19, 22, 35, 36, 42, 74], 6 utilised field running [14, 43, 58], 3 used kayaking [13, 41], 3 used rowing [33, 48], 3 used 
resistance training in the form of knee extensions [9, 36, 45], and 1 each for underwater diving [46], walking [49], and arm/leg 
crank [51]. Eight trials investigated exercise performance in hypoxic conditions [45, 46, 12, 47, 38, 42, 39]. Exercise duration 
ranged from 1.5 to 137 minutes. All studies included a NO3- and placebo group.  
 
 
3.2 Characteristics of subjects 
In total, 581 participants (494 males, 87 females) participated in the included studies. The mean ages ranged from 16.7 [48] to 
64 [49] years. Fifty-nine trials had male only participants, 4 trials had exclusively women subjects [40, 41, 50, 43], and 13 trials 
had both sexes [51, 10, 45, 46, 18, 11, 49, 44, 35]. The number of participants involved in the trials ranged from 5 [41] to 28 [32], 
with a mean sample size of 10.8 ± 4.  
 
𝑉̇ O2max values were reported in 53 trials, with values ranging between 28.2 and 81.1 mL kg-1 min-1. Porcelli et al. [14] 
implemented 2 trials with participants classified in the “low aerobic fitness” group (28.1- 44.1 mL kg-1 min-1). The remaining 51 
trials included participants with a 𝑉̇ O2max > 45 mL kg-1 min-1, and ranged from “physically active” and “well-trained”, right up to 
“elite” international level athletes.   
 
3.3 Nitrate administration  
The trials utilised a variety of dietary NO3- supplementation types. The majority opted for beetroot juice (n=58; 76%) as the 
source of NO3- delivery, 6 used NO3- water [14], 4 used sodium NO3- [6, 51-53], 3 utilised pomegranate extract [35], 3 used 
potassium NO3- [19, 54, 55], and 1 trial each for NO3- gel [56] and beetroot portions [18]. There was a large variability in the 
amount of NO3- given per dose, with doses ranging from 4.1mmol [32] – 19.5mmol per day [22]. 
 
The intervention period ranged from 30 minutes to 15 days prior to testing. Forty trials had an acute invention protocol, 
whereas 36 trials utilised a chronic dietary NO3- supplementation protocol.  
 
3.4 Methodological quality of studies  
The mean PEDro score was 8.8 ± 1.1 out of 10. All 47 studies reviewed scored a moderate to high score of 7 and above. Thirty-
nine of the 47 studies reported blinding of both the assessors and participants, and received a perfect 10 score, 4 studies scored 
 8 out of 10 as they failed to blind therapists and assessors thus opting for a single-blind crossover study design [13, 32, 56, 41], 
and the remaining 4 studies scored 7 out of 10 due to a lack of allocation concealment and single-blind crossover studies [10, 12, 
20, 21]. Overall, the study quality was deemed to be good to excellent.

3.5 Meta-Analysis  
 
3.5.1 Time trial performance 
Following data pooling from 28 trials, the standardised mean difference was -0.10 (95% Cl -0.27 - 0.06), 
providing a trivial, but non-significant effect in favour of dietary NO3- supplementation in TT performance 
measures (p > 0.05) as shown in Fig. 2. There was no heterogeneity displayed among these studies (I2 = 0%; Q 
= 7.46, df = 27, p = 1.00), utilising a random effects analysis

3.5.2 Time to exhaustion 
The standardised mean difference from 22 trials was 0.33 (95% Cl 0.15 - 0.50), indicating a small to moderate 
statistically significant effect in favour of dietary NO3- supplementation in TTE performance measures (p < 
0.01) as shown in Fig. 3. There was no heterogeneity displayed among these studies (I2 = 0%; Q = 9.82, df = 21, 
p = 0.98) utilising a random effects analysis.

The standardised mean difference from 8 trials was 0.25 (95% Cl -0.06 - 0.56), providing a small, but non-
significant effect in favour of dietary NO3- supplementation in GXT performance measures (p > 0.05) as shown 
in Fig. 4. There was no heterogeneity displayed among these studies (I2 = 0%; Q = 0.90, df = 7, p = 1.00) utilising 
a random effects analysis.

Publication bias was assessed by visual inspection of the funnel plot of standard error verses ES for 
both TT (Fig. 5) and TTE (Fig. 6), with minor asymmetrical inverted distributions prominent for both plots. For 
both TT performance and TTE, there was evidence of publication bias, Egger’s test <0.02 and <0.001 
respectively, suggesting small study bias.  
 
3.5.4 Meta-regression analyses 
There was no statistically significant effects observed from the meta-regression analysis. Data from the 
analyses of moderator variables are presented in Tables 4 and 5. A positive trend towards significance (p = 
0.11) was seen in trials implementing a chronic dosage regime in the TTE protocol.

3.6 Adverse Events 
Information on adverse events was reported in 6 of the 47 studies. Bailey et al. [15], Bailey et al. [9], Vanhatalo 
et al. [10] and Wylie et al. [31] reported beeturia (red urine) and red stools. Hoon et al. [32] reported the 
withdrawal of one subject due to a beetroot juice intolerance. Hoon et al. [33] reported slight gastrointestinal 
symptoms immediately after beetroot juice ingestion across the exercise trials, while another reported minor 
discomfort before one trial. Both occurrences were resolved prior to performance tests. Peeling et al. [41] 
measured NO3- ingestion and its effects on gut sensation. The results showed a lower level of gut distress after 
a double dose beetroot juice (~9.6 mmol of NO3-) when compared to the placebo protocol. No major adverse 
events were reported across the 47 studies.

4. Discussion 
The primary aim of this study was to perform a systematic review and meta-analysis to determine the efficacy 
of dietary NO3- supplementation on endurance exercise performance. The pooled analysis for nitrate’s 
  
Page 26 of 37 
 
influence on TTE showed a significantly greater ES when compared to a placebo control. However, the small 
effects of dietary NO3- supplementation on TT and GXT performance were not statistically significant. The 
main conclusion of this meta-analysis was the differing effects dietary NO3- supplementation had on TT and 
TTE protocols. 
The findings of this meta-analysis are similar to that of a previous meta-analysis of the impact of 
dietary NO3- supplementation’s on exercise performance. In Hoon et al.’s [23] meta-analysis TT protocols had 
an ES of -0.11 (n = 9) compared to an ES of -0.12 (n = 24) in the present study. In addition, Hoon et al.’s [23] 
meta-analysis of GXT protocols had an ES of 0.23 (n = 7) compared to an ES of 0.25 (n = 8) in the present study. 
Hoon et al. [23] also found that dietary NO3- supplementation has a statistically significant effect on TTE 
protocols (ES = 0.79; n = 3). Similarly, the results of the current meta-analysis suggest dietary NO3- 
supplementation is more likely to affect TTE protocols (ES = 0.33; n = 22). The larger number of trials in the 
current meta-analysis reinforce the findings reported by Hoon et al. [23] and strengthens the evidence for 
dietary NO3- supplementation. This review and quantitative analysis provides an important contribution to the 
literature and suggests that there is clear evidence that  dietary NO3- supplementation can boost aerobic 
exercise capacity measured by TTE protocols.  
This enhanced exercise performance in TTE protocols is likely due to the reduced whole-body O2 cost 
of constant-work-rate exercise following dietary NO3- supplementation [15, 51, 76]. Bailey et al. [9] reported 
that the decrease in O2 cost correlates with a reduced ATP cost of muscle force production, creating a 
reduction in the phosphocreatine degradation, as well as a reduced accumulation of adenosine diphosphate 
and inorganic phosphate concentration during low and high-intensity exercise (knee extensions) after beetroot 
juice supplementation when compared to a placebo. Moreover, beetroot juice supplementation significantly 
reduced muscle ATP hydrolysis during both low and high-intensity exercise bouts. The authors speculated that 
the possible mechanisms behind the in vivo decrease in O2 cost of exercise following NO3- supplementation is 
predominantly a result of a reduction in total ATP cost of muscle force production, and not an increase in 
mitochondrial phosphate/O2 ratio. Alternatively, Jones [60] suggests that the decreases in steady-state 𝑉̇ O2 
and phosphocreatine after dietary NO3- supplementation could potentially be due to the simultaneous 
improvement of mitochondrial efficiency and muscle oxygenation. These findings suggest a fatigue protocol 
  
Page 27 of 37 
 
such as TTE may be more suited for dietary NO3- studies looking at the physiological mechanisms affecting 
performance and exercise capacity.  
The ergogenic effect of dietary NO3- was more apparent when TTE tests were used as the main 
outcome measure. Protocols involving exercising until exhaustion have been suggested to have a greater 
variability than TT tests [61, 62]. In a study by Saris et al. [61], times to exhaustion across five trials resulted in 
a high coefficient of variation (CV) of 26.6%, with an individual CV range from 17.4% to 39.5%. In the same 
study, two time-trial protocols produced a CV of 3.5% and 3.4%, and the individual CV ranged from 1.7% to 
5.8% and 0.8% to 5.8% respectively. Thus it initially appears surprising that the ergogenic effects were 
significant only when the more variable TTE measures were used. However, Amann et al. [63] found similar 
sensitivities between TT and TTE protocols suggesting TTE protocols are a valid option when determining the 
effects of an intervention on endurance performance. Jeukendrup et al. [64] suggested the difference in the 
variability between protocols could be attributed to differences in the influence of psychological factors such 
as motivation and monotony on the outcome measure and that TTE protocols measure endurance capacity 
rather than exercise performance, which is better measured by TT protocols. Clearly further research is 
required to determine why the present analysis shows a greater ergogenic effect of dietary NO3- when TTE 
protocols are used as the outcome measure rather than TT protocols. It is worth noting that a TT protocol has 
been suggested to be the most appropriate and reliable choice for an intervention resembling “real-life” 
endurance exercise performance (63) and therefore, these protocols may be the most ecologically valid option 
when assessing the impact of dietary NO3- supplementation on performance [65, 66].  
Despite not being statistically significant, the 0.8% improvement in TT performance following dietary 
NO3- supplementation may be meaningful for athletes. To put this into perspective, the difference between 
first and twelfth place in the 10000m men’s running final at the 2012 London Olympics was only 0.66% [67]; 
therefore, it is still prudent to recommend dietary NO3- supplementation to aid endurance exercise 
performance, when small improvements in performance can be particularly meaningful. In addition, using 
dietary NO3- supplementation to increase TTE during training may result in the completion of more intervals, 
enhancing those physiological adaptations that improve TT performance. 
  
Page 28 of 37 
 
Moderator variables, including exercise type, exercise duration, dose duration, NO3- type, dose 
amount, study quality, fitness level (𝑉̇ O2max), and percentage NO2- change, did not appear to have any 
significant interactions on the effects of dietary NO3- supplementation on exercise performance. 
A chronic dosage regime appears to show a trend towards a slightly better performance outcome 
than acute on the TTE protocol (ES: 0.29; p = 0.11). Interestingly, there were two studies that directly 
compared chronic and acute doses on performance. Vanhatalo et al. [10] found that chronic ingestion (15 
days) of beetroot juice had a greater effect on peak power output, gas exchange threshold, and blood pressure 
compared to an acute dosage (2.5 hours prior to testing). Boorsma et al. [22] also reported a slight 
improvement in TT performance after a chronic dosing protocol (8 days), whereas participants consuming an 
acute dose (2.5 hours prior to testing) of dietary NO3- did not improve exercise efficiency or performance. 
Taking into account the results from the meta-analysis and also these studies, it would appear that chronic 
dosing may be more likely to produce a benefit; however, further research is needed to understand what 
length of dietary NO3- supplementation period elicits the best outcome.    
Interestingly, level of fitness did not influence the ergogenic effect of dietary NO3- supplementation 
according to the continuous variable meta-regression, however, the subjects involved in the trials had a similar 
fitness level; therefore, we were unable to determine confidently the effect training status has on the 
response to dietary NO3- supplementation. The only study to directly compare individual aerobic fitness levels 
with dietary NO3- supplementation observed positive improvements in sedentary and moderately trained 
individuals, but not highly trained subjects [14]. Further research should be specifically targeted towards the 
level of fitness variable before definitive conclusions can be made regarding its effect on the dietary NO3- 
supplementation response.  
 
A potential limitation of this meta-analysis is the possible effect of publication bias with the 
suggestion of small study bias. However, these types of studies typically employ small sample sizes. Thus, there 
may be other sources of funnel plot asymmetry, e.g. true heterogeneity and chance [30]. Although studies 
included in the meta-analysis showed no statistical heterogeneity, they still varied considerably in study 
design. Differences in exercise mode, dose duration and amount, mode of NO3- delivery, test duration, and 
NO3- type along with a lack of repetition when measuring these variables made it difficult to draw conclusions 
and make interpretations from the results. Additionally, univariate meta-regression does have limitations that 
  
Page 29 of 37 
 
can diminish its ability to make valid conclusions. The main limitation of the uni-variate approach is that 
potential moderators cannot be assessed in isolation in trials with large numbers of characteristics. The 
findings of this meta-analysis demonstrate that there is enough evidence to suggest dietary NO3- 
supplementation can improve endurance exercise performance; however, more experimental trials need to be 
conducted with a research focus on potential moderator variables to provide definitive conclusions and 
recommendations for dietary NO3- supplementation and its effect on endurance exercise performance. 
 
With respect to moderator variables, future research might also be designed to isolate the ergogenic 
effect of nitrate ingestion for individuals possessing different muscle fibre type proportions. For example, 
research conducted by Hernandez et al. [71] on the effect of dietary NO3- ingestion observed an enhanced 
contractile force in fast-twitch muscles in the NO3- supplemented mice. The results translate to an activation of 
fast-twitch muscle fibres at a lower frequency but still achieving the same force after dietary NO3- 
supplementation, therefore, a reduced effort required to perform a given task. Dietary NO3- supplementation 
appears to be particularly effective at improving physiological responses in type II muscle [11, 37, 71, 72] and 
can lead to increased force production at higher contraction velocities [73], and improved performance during 
short-duration high-intensity intermittent exercise [74, 75] when type II muscle fibre recruitment is high. This 
provides an interesting avenue for future research investigating the effects of dietary NO3- supplementation on 
performance during intermittent and power exercise tests. 
5. Conclusion 
In summary, the findings of this systematic review and meta-analysis provide convincing evidence 
that dietary NO3- supplementation is likely to elicit a positive outcome when testing endurance exercise 
capacity, but is less likely to be effective for TT performance. The design of the test protocol selection may 
influence the conclusion regarding the ergogenic effect of dietary NO3- supplementation. Further work is 
needed to understand the optimal dosing strategies, which population is most likely to benefit, and under 
which conditions dietary nitrates are likely to be most effective for enhancing performance.

 Criterion 
Operational Definition 
 
 
 
 
 All criteria 
Points are awarded only when a criterion is clearly satisfied. If on a literal reading of the trial report, it is 
  
possible that a criterion was not satisfied, a point should not be awarded for that criterion. 
 Criterion 1 
This criterion is satisfied if the report describes the source of subjects and a list of criteria used to determine who 
  
was eligible to participate in the study. 
 Criterion 2 
A study is considered to have used random allocation if the report states that allocation was random. The precise 
  
method of randomization need not be specified. Procedures such as coin tossing and dice rolling should be 
  
considered random. Quasi-randomization allocation procedures such as allocation by hospital record number 
  
or birth date, or alternation, do not satisfy this criterion. 
 Criterion 3 
Concealed allocation means that the person who determined if a subject was eligible for inclusion in the trial 
  
was unaware, when this decision was made, of which group the subject would be allocated to. A point is 
  
awarded for this criterion, even if it is not stated that allocation was concealed, when the report states that 
  
allocation was by sealed opaque envelopes or that allocation involved contacting the holder of the allocation 
  
schedule who was “off-site.” 
 Criterion 4 
At a minimum, in studies of therapeutic interventions, the report must describe at least one measure of the severity 
  
of the condition being treated and at least one (different) key outcome measure at baseline. The rater must be 
  
satisfied that the groups’ outcomes would not be expected to differ, on the basis of baseline differences in 
  
prognostic variables alone, by a clinically significant amount. This criterion is satisfied even if only baseline 
  
data of subjects completing the study are presented. 
 Criteria 4, 7–11 
Key outcomes are those outcomes that provide the primary measure of the effectiveness (or lack of effectiveness) 
  
of the therapy. In most studies, more than one variable is used as an outcome measure. 
 Criteria 5–7 
Blinding means the person in question (subject, therapist, or assessor) did not know which group the subject had 
  
been allocated to. In addition, subjects and therapists are only considered to be “blind” if it could be expected 
  
that they would have been unable to distinguish between the treatments applied to different groups. In trials in 
  
which key outcomes are self-reported (e.g., visual analog scale, pain diary), the assessor is considered to be 
  
blind if the subject was blind. 
 Criterion 8 
This criterion is satisfied only if the report explicitly states both the number of subjects initially allocated to groups 
  
and the number of subjects from whom key outcome measurements were obtained. In trials in which outcomes 
  
are measured at several points in time, a key outcome must have been measured in more than 85% of subjects 
  
at one of those points in time. 
 Criterion 9 
An intention-to-treat analysis means that, where subjects did not receive treatment (or the control condition) as 
  
allocated and where measures of outcomes were available, the analysis was performed as if subjects received 
  
the treatment (or control condition) they were allocated to. This criterion is satisfied, even if there is no mention 
  
of analysis by intention to treat, if the report explicitly states that all subjects received treatment or control 
  
conditions as allocated. 
 Criterion 10 
A between-group statistical comparison involves statistical comparison of one group with another. Depending on 
  
the design of the study, this may involve comparison of 2 or more treatments or comparison of treatment with a 
  
control condition. The analysis may be a simple comparison of outcomes measured after the treatment was 
  
administered or a comparison of the change in one group with the change in another (when a factorial 
  
analysis of variance has been used to analyse the data, the latter is often reported as a group   time 
  
interaction). The comparison may be in the form hypothesis testing (which provides a P value, describing the 
  
probability that the groups differed only by chance) or in the form of an estimate (eg, the mean or median 
  
difference, a difference in proportions, number needed to treat, a relative risk or hazard ratio) and its 
  
confidence interval. 
 Criterion 11 
A point measure is a measure of the size of the treatment effect. The treatment effect may be described as a 
  
difference in group outcomes or as the outcome in (each of) all groups. Measures of variability include 
  
standard deviations, standard errors, confidence intervals, interquartile ranges (or other quartile ranges), and 
  
ranges. Point measures and/or measures of variability may be provided graphically (e.g., standard deviations 
  
may be given as error bars in a figure) as long as it is clear what is being graphed (e.g., as long as it is clear 
  
whether error bars represent standard deviations or standard errors). Where outcomes are categorical, this 
  
criterion is considered to have been met if the number of subjects in each category is given for each group.
