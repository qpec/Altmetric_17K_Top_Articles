ABSTRACT
Asthma during pregnancy is associated with retardation of fetal growth in a sex-specific
manner. Lactobacilli microbes influence infant growth. This study aimed to determine whether lactobacilli
and other microbes are reduced in the gut of infants born to an asthmatic mother, and whether this
differs by the sex of the infant.
Mother-infant pairs (N=1021) from the Canadian Healthy Infant Longitudinal Development full-term
cohort were studied. The abundance of infant faecal microbiota at 3–4 months, profiled by gene
sequencing, was compared between both women with and without asthma treatment during pregnancy.
Infant sex, maternal ethnicity, pre-pregnancy overweight and atopy status, birth mode, breastfeeding status
and intrapartum antibiotic treatment were tested as covariates.
Independent of birth mode and other covariates, male, Caucasian infants born to women with prenatal
asthma harboured fewer lactobacilli in the gut at 3–4 months of age. If asthmatic mothers had pre-
pregnancy overweight, the abundance of Lactobacillus in males was further reduced in the infant gut,
whereas the microbiota of female infants was enriched with Bacteroidaceae. Similar differences in infant
gut microbial composition according to maternal prenatal asthma status were also more evident among
women with food or environmental allergies.
Gut lactobacilli were less abundant in male infants, but Bacteroidaceae were more abundant in female
infants at 3–4 months of age, following maternal asthma during pregnancy.

ORIGINAL ARTICLE
ASTHMA
 Introduction
Asthma is a common chronic disorder during pregnancy, affecting between 8% and 13% of pregnant
women [1]; it is often a comorbid condition with food and environmental allergies [2]. Asthma
exacerbation rates during pregnancy are high [3], and more severe asthma or poor symptom control have
been associated with low birthweight [4–7]. A greater risk for childhood asthma following uncontrolled
versus controlled maternal asthma during pregnancy has been reported [8]. These variations in risk to the
offspring point to a potential in utero influence of maternal asthma. Asthma during pregnancy often leads
to maternal antibiotic treatment and delivery by caesarean [7, 9], interventions that can interrupt the
transfer of maternal lactobacilli, which become more prominent in the placenta, gut and vaginal tract in
the last trimester of pregnancy [10–13]. Reduced abundance of Lactobacillales has been observed in the
meconium of newborns of mothers with atopic disease [14].
Female infants are generally born smaller than male infants; however, in response to maternal asthma, the
Caucasian male fetus is more likely to have a lower birthweight and show growth retardation when
delivered at term than the female fetus [5]. MARTIN et al. [15] recently reported less colonisation of stool
with Lactobacillus species at birth and during the first month of life among full-term male infants in
comparison to female infants. Postnatally, depending on the Lactobacillus species, since weight promotion
is species-specific, the dominance of lactobacilli in the infant gut will determine the extent of weight gain
and subsequent atopic disease [16–18]. Altogether, evidence is mounting for a programming role of
prenatal asthma that might affect the infant gut microbiome. These observations led us to study the
influence of maternal asthma status during pregnancy on infant intestinal microbiota in the Canadian
Healthy Infant Longitudinal Development (CHILD) general population birth cohort. Specifically, we
determined whether the genus Lactobacillus was reduced in the gut of infants born to an asthmatic
mother, especially in the gut of male infants. Second, we sought evidence for a fetal programming role of
maternal asthma that was independent of birth mode and related events, and was enhanced by maternal
comorbid conditions, such as overweight and atopic disease.
Material and methods
Study design and sample collection
This study was conducted on 1021 mothers and their infants who participated in the Canadian Healthy
Infant Longitudinal Development (CHILD) Study – a national population-based birth cohort (www.
canadianchildstudy.ca) [19–21]. Pregnant women were recruited in their second or third trimester at the
Manitoba, Edmonton (Alberta) and Vancouver (Ontario) sites of the CHILD cohort. Written informed
consent was obtained from all mothers. This microbiome study of the CHILD cohort was approved by the
Human Research Ethics Boards of the University of Alberta (#Pro00010073). Hospital birth records
provided data on mode of delivery, sex and infant exposures during birth. The mothers’ anthropometry
pre-pregnancy and infant diets were obtained from standardised questionnaires and hospital records.
Asthma during pregnancy was defined as present, if mothers had responded ‘yes’ to the question ‘Have
you had any treatment for asthma or wheezing in the last 12 months?’ in prenatal questionnaires. Any
treatment for asthma, as indicated by hospitalisation, a physician’s visit or medication use, has been
validated as a measure for asthma morbidity during pregnancy [22]. The 12-month assessment period of
asthma treatment included the time just prior to conception. Since 23–30% of asthmatic women
discontinue treatment during pregnancy due to lessening symptoms, [22, 23] the CHILD study
questionnaire would have correctly classified women reporting treatment prior to conception but not
during pregnancy.
Data on maternal atopic status during pregnancy was also obtained from prenatal questionnaires as
symptoms in response to one or more food or environmental allergens, such as hay fever, atopic
dermatitis, and allergies to pollens, grasses, trees, weeds, food, insects or pets. Faecal samples were
obtained from infants at 3–4 months of age for microbial profiling. Parents were instructed to refrigerate
soiled diapers prior to retrieval by a CHILD research assistant during a home visit. Faecal samples were
then transported to the laboratory in a cooler, where they were divided into aliquots and stored at −80°C
prior to DNA extraction and sequencing.
Sequencing and data processing
Pooled 16S rRNA fragments were sequenced using the MiSeq Illumina sequencing method at the Centre
for the Analysis of Genome Evolution & Function at the University of Toronto. Sequences were
de-multiplexed and binned into individual samples according to their barcodes using the QIIME pipeline
(version 1.8.0). The sequences were then quality filtered by removing reads having more than 10 sites with
a Phred quality score less than 20. Using the closed-picking algorithm in QIIME, sequences that passed
quality control were clustered into operational taxonomic units (OTUs) at a 97% similarity cut-off. Finally,
OTUs were aligned with the Greengenes bacterial reference database (v. 13.5) to identify microbes at the
https://doi.org/10.1183/13993003.00280-2017

 phylum, family and genus levels. The OTUs with an overall relative abundance below 0.0001 were
excluded from subsequent analyses [24]. After cleaning and processing, the total number of unique OTUs
was 1325 and the total number of reads was 270 million (median 2.3×105 per sample, range 6.7×103–
8.3×106). Data were rarefied to 13 000 sequences per sample. The metrics of OTU (microbial) relative
abundance and diversity (Shannon and Simpson diversity indices, Chao1 species richness index) were
generated in QIIME to profile infant gut microbiota in individual faecal samples.
Statistical analysis
The statistical analysis of data was performed with the Statistical Analysis Systems (SAS) Software (version
9.4.; SAS Institute Inc., Cary, NC, USA). Relative abundance of microbial taxa (at the phylum, family or
genus level) and biodiversity measures (Chao1, Shannon and Simpson indices) were presented as medians
and interquartile ranges, because these measures were not normally distributed. Medians were compared
using the non-parametric Wilcoxon rank sum test or the Kruskal–Wallis test for >2 group comparisons,
with statistical significance at p<0.05. Although the hypothesis regarding lactobacilli was a priori, the
Benjamini–Hochberg method to adjust p-values for the false discovery rate (FDR, where p<FDR p) was
applied to analyses for all bacterial taxa with the SAS multi-test procedure [25]. As gut microbiome
differences have been reported between European/North American and Asian populations [26], analyses
were restricted to mothers of Caucasian ethnicity. Restriction to Caucasian ethnicity also allowed us to test
associations within a population at highest risk for infant wheeze: male Caucasian infants [27].
To test the a priori research question on infant sex and adjust for putative confounding factors, analyses
were stratified by infant sex, birth mode, breastfeeding status and intrapartum antibiotic exposure (also a
strong marker for infant antibiotic use; [28]). Using the adjusted rank transform (ART) nonparametric test
for interaction [29], the p-value for the interaction between infant sex and maternal prenatal asthma on
Lactobacillus abundance was 0.001. To determine the impact of maternal comorbid conditions, statistical
testing was also performed following stratification by maternal prenatal atopy status and pre-pregnancy
weight (normal weight ⩽24.9; overweight ⩾25.0 body mass index). Independence of association between
maternal asthma during pregnancy, and highest or lowest tertile Lactobacillus levels was further
determined using purposeful stepwise logistic regression modelling, adjusting for confounding factors. To
identify discriminative taxonomic biomarkers, the linear discriminant analysis effect size (LEfSe) was
conducted with a linear discriminant analysis (LDA) log score cut-off of 2, followed by the Kruskal–Wallis
test with the Dunn’s multiple comparison test, using no prenatal maternal asthma as the reference group.
Results
9% of the infants under study were born to women with asthma during pregnancy, the majority by vaginal
delivery; 8% of these infants were born by emergency caesarean and 7% by elective caesarean. Similar to
the whole cohort, 79% of infants born to asthmatic mothers were fed breast milk at 3–4 months. Prenatal
maternal asthma was not differentially distributed by infant sex or ethnicity, birth mode, early term birth,
birthweight, breastfeeding status, maternal pre-pregnancy weight and maternal intrapartum antibiotic
treatment (table 1); it tended to be higher in both the lowest and highest infant weight gain tertiles. Food
and environmental allergies during pregnancy were more common among women with prenatal asthma
than among those without asthma. Compared to the complete CHILD birth cohort [20], our CHILD
study population of 1021 mother-infant pairs was similar in terms of male sex (53% versus 52%),
Caucasian ethnicity (78% versus 73%) and atopic status of the mother (61% versus 58%).
Gut microbiota of all infants at 3–4 months of age were dominated by members of the phyla
Bacteroidetes, Firmicutes and Proteobacteria (supplementary figure S1). Microbiota in female infants
tended to be enhanced with Bacteroidetes (median relative abundance, 20.8% versus 9.3%). With the
exception of Firmicutes being less abundant in female infants born to women with asthma (p=0.03), no
other differences were evident in phylum abundance, microbial richness or diversity between infants born
to women with versus those without prenatal asthma (supplementary figure S1, supplementary table S1).
Crude differences in median and high abundance were found for gut colonisation by members of the
genus Lactobacillus, according to infant feeding and asthma status of the mother (table 1).
The abundance of Lactobacillus was significantly lower among infants born to women with non-Caucasian
ethnicity and to women with asthma during pregnancy (table 1). Based on the ART test, the p-value for
the interaction term between prenatal asthma and Caucasian ethnicity was 0.002. In Caucasian infants,
prenatal maternal asthma was significantly associated with a lower relative abundance of the genus
Lactobacillus (median 0.001% versus 0.002%, p=0.01; table 2). This genus was not differentially abundant
by maternal asthma status in non-Caucasian infants (data not shown). Stratification by infant sex yielded
statistical significance for a reduction in gut Lactobacillus species among Caucasian male infants (median
0.002% versus 0.0005%, p=0.02), but not female infants born to women with asthma. No differences in gut

 Lactobacillus abundance were found between non-Caucasian males born to mothers with (median
0.0005%, n=5) and without (median 0.0007%, n=112) prenatal asthma.
To reduce bias from perinatal exposures, comparisons were conducted only within vaginally delivered,
breastfed infants, who were not exposed to maternal antibiotics during birth. The restricted analyses
revealed similar trends for the genus Lactobacillus in the gut microbiota of male, Caucasian infants
(p=0.06) born to an asthmatic mother (table 3, supplementary table S2). Other sex-specific differences
were uncovered. Following prenatal asthma, the gut of female, Caucasian infants, born vaginally and
breastfed, without exposure to maternal intrapartum antibiotics, was more abundant in members of the

 Bacteroidetes phylum (p=0.02, table 3) and less abundant in Enterobacteriaceae (p=0.03). Differences were
also evident at the Bacteroidaceae family level (p=0.02, supplementary table S2) in all female breastfed
infants born vaginally without intrapartum antibiotics, alongside a reduction in abundance of the
Firmicutes phylum (p<0.05).
Lactobacilli were less abundant in male infants born to women with asthma and concomitant food or
environmental allergies, or asthma and pre-pregnancy overweight; statistical significance was not observed in
the absence of either comorbidity (table 4). Based on the ART test, the p-value for the interaction term
between prenatal asthma and infant sex on Lactobacillus abundance was 0.003 for maternal atopy
comorbidity and 0.06 for overweight comorbidity. Following the same maternal asthma comorbidity during
pregnancy, the abundance of Bacteroidaceae was substantially and significantly higher in female infants. The
p-value for this sex interaction term was 0.001 for maternal atopy comorbidity and 0.002 for overweight
(ART test). Firmicutes were much less abundant in females born to overweight mothers with asthma. Within
the Firmicutes phylum, the genus Megasphaera was less abundant in the infant gut following maternal
asthma comorbid with overweight or atopy, and this difference was statistically significant in females of
mothers with atopic asthma (table 4). The p-value for the sex interaction term for differences in Megasphera
abundance related to maternal atopic asthma was 0.14 (ART test). Following atopic asthma during
pregnancy, Enterobacteriaceae were less common in the gut microbiota of offspring, more so in males than
females; only Bacteroidaceae enrichment survived correction for multiple testing. With one exception (when
the crude p-value was 0.06 with reduced sample size following restriction, as presented in table 3), reductions
in Lactobacillus abundance were also statistically significant after the FDR correction.

 Adjustment for covariates in multi-variable regression showed the association between prenatal maternal
asthma and gut lactobacilli in offspring to be quite robust (table 5). Independent of maternal atopy status
and pre-pregnancy weight, birth mode, intrapartum antibiotic prophylaxis, breastfeeding status and sex,
infants exposed to maternal asthma during pregnancy were one-third as likely to have Lactobacillus
abundance in the highest tertile at 3–4 months of age. Statistical significance was confirmed in male (aOR,
0.26, 95% CI 0.07–0.89), but not female infants (aOR, 0.48, 95% CI 0.17–1.32). Regression models to
predict the lowest tertile Lactobacillus abundance in infants as the outcome, showed no statistical
associations with prenatal asthma status (data not shown). Only 2% of Caucasian infants received
probiotic products; their exclusion from analyses did not change any of the findings.
Finally, using the LEfSe method to test differences at the species level (figure 1), an unclassified
Lactobacillus species was found to be less abundant in male Caucasian infants born to mothers with atopic
asthma (LDA score 2.93, p<0.05). Unclassified Megasphera species (LDA score 3.34, p=0.003) were
comparatively less abundant and Bacteroides fragilis (LDA 3.29, p=0.02) were more abundant in female
Caucasian infants born to mothers with atopic asthma.
Discussion
In a birth cohort study of 1021 full-term Canadian infants, we detected alterations to gut microbial
composition at 3–4 months following pregnancy complicated with asthma versus pregnancy without
asthma. Infants of mothers with asthma harboured fewer lactobacilli in their gut microbiota, especially if

 they were male and of Caucasian ethnicity (p=0.02). Moreover, the reduction in Lactobacillus species
abundance was most apparent if Caucasian mothers with asthma had pre-pregnancy overweight or a
history of food or environmental allergies. While no prior evidence exists for maternal prenatal asthma,
these findings are compatible with the reduced Lactobacillales abundance observed in the meconium of
newborns of mothers with eczema, and lower faecal colonisation with Lactobacillus species in infants of
atopic parents [14, 28]. In our study, male infants born to mothers with prenatal asthma were one-third
(aOR 0.26, 95% CI: 0.07–0.89) as likely to be colonised with high levels of lactobacilli, independent of
maternal overweight or atopy status, birth mode or infant diet. These associations were not present in
female offspring.
Male infants are at higher risk of developing wheeze during infancy than female infants, especially if they
are Caucasian [27], although sex differences in gut microbiota composition have not been a focus of
attention until recently [15]. Literature reporting a higher risk for overweight with antibiotic use in male,

 but not female infants suggests differential sensitivity of male gut microbiota to environmental
perturbations [17]. In their Australian Caucasian cohort, CLIFTON et al. [6] found that the response of the
male placenta to maternal asthma exacerbations was minimal compared to that of the female placenta,
with few changes to pro-inflammatory gene expression and 11β-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase activity in
the placenta. This reduced response of the placenta heightened the risk for intrauterine growth restriction
in male newborns. Noteworthy in our study is that no other significant changes to gut microbial
composition were found for male infants born to asthmatic mothers, and Lactobacillus differences survived
multiple correction. In alignment with evidence for prenatal asthma programming effects on infant
growth, and the link between infant growth and gut microbial composition and atopic dermatitis [16, 30],
our results hint at possible sexually dimorphic effects of prenatal asthma on infant gut microbiota.
As persistent residents of the human gastrointestinal tract in early infancy [31], lactate-producing
lactobacilli are less abundant in the gut of infants who develop atopic disease by age 5 [32, 33].
Lactobacillus species are documented to elevate growth and immune factors in breast milk and
anti-inflammatory cytokine levels in cord blood, when administered prenatally to the mother [34]; and
postnatally, lactobacilli probiotics promote weight gain in infants [35]. A recent study by FARR et al. [36]
observed birthweights of less than 2500 g to be more common following a mid-pregnancy vaginal
microbiota dominated by non-lactobacilli versus lactobacilli microbes. Further, lactobacilli found in
amniotic fluid are capable of modulating expression of toll-like receptor genes in the fetal gut [37]. In our
study, the reduction in Lactobacillus abundance was most apparent among infants whose mothers had
asthma and overweight or a history of allergies. Indeed, risk for atopic sensitisation at age 5 is reportedly
elevated, with lower Lactobacillus colonisation by the age of 2 months in infants born to atopic parents [33].

 lower abundance of Bacteroidetes or Ruminococcaceae, or higher abundance of the Clostridium cluster, but
these observations were evident either at a much younger or older infant age; furthermore, sex-specific
findings were not reported in these studies [38].
Maternal overweight during pregnancy has been linked to a higher risk of asthma and other atopic
diseases in offspring [39, 40]. In our study infants, maternal asthma comorbidity with this added risk for
offspring also yielded a reduction in the abundance of faecal Megasphaera in female infants and an
elevation in the abundance of Bacteroidaceae. The latter remained statistically significant after adjustment
for the FDR; both species were identified as statistically more abundant by the LEfSe method. Both
Megasphaera and Bacteroidaceae microbes produce propionate, but under opposing conditions. The
Megasphaera species utilise lactate as a substrate to produce propionate [41], whereas Bacteroides species
produce propionate when lactate levels are low [42]. Propionate is absorbed by the host for liver
gluconeogenesis, possesses anti-inflammatory and satiety properties [43, 44], and protects against the
development of allergic asthma in a murine model [45].
Lactobacillus bacteria are available to the newborn during vaginal delivery and breastfeeding, and are
sensitive to antibiotic treatment [10, 46, 47]. Caesarean delivery and formula feeding have the potential to
diminish maternal transfer of lactobacilli and other microbes to the infant [13, 48]. Yet, the reduction in
Lactobacillus abundance was also evident in male infants who were breastfed following vaginal delivery
without maternal antibiotics, although statistical significance was lost after the reduction in sample size.
Under the same circumstances, an enrichment of Bacteroidaceae and depletion of Enterobactericeae was
detected in female microbiota following maternal prenatal asthma. Of interest, in the same cohort of
infants, we found that a lower ratio of the faecal abundance of Enterobactericeae to Bacteroidaceae
protected against food sensitisation [49]. Hence, our findings suggest a programming role for maternal
asthma in shaping early gut colonisation, which cannot be attributed to caesarean delivery, antibiotic use
or formula feeding, and which differs by sex and might confer less immediate risk for allergy in female
infants [45].
There are several strengths to our research. Our findings were based on a large population-based cohort of
full-term infants that included early-term infants, who are more likely to be delivered by asthmatic women
and develop asthma [7, 50]. The large sample size also afforded stratification by covariates to identify
associations between microbiota and maternal asthma, which were independent of birth-related events [28].
We adjusted p-values for multiple testing and verified sex and ethnicity interactions with a non-parametric
test for interaction. High throughput gene sequencing enabled profiling of whole microbial communities in
infant faecal samples, whereas most studies to date have targeted individual species. On the other hand, while
the pregnancy questionnaire included criteria which had been validated as measures of prenatal asthma
morbidity, maternal asthma status during pregnancy was not verified by a physician; neither did we test
asthma severity, which might explain the modest impact of maternal asthma on birthweight [51].
Both prenatal and postnatal exposures are potential stimuli for health programming in the infant, through
the modification of intestinal microbiota [52, 53]. Initial colonisation of the neonatal gut plays a central
role in the development of the immune system [54]. Our results provide the first evidence of a
programming effect of prenatal maternal asthma on gut microbial composition that is independent of
birth and postnatal events. In addition to smaller lung size at birth [20] or other risk factors for wheeze [27],
reductions in gut lactobacilli point to another pathway for persistent asthma in male Caucasian infants.
Having fewer intestinal lactobacilli also has additional implications for male infants, such as reduced resistance
to pathogens [55]; whereas gut microbial changes, such as an increased abundance of Bacteroidaceae, might
have a protective effect in female infants.
