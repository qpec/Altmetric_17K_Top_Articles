SUMMARY
Tau pathology is a hallmark of Alzheimer’s disease
(AD) but also occurs in normal cognitive aging. Using
the tau PET agent 18F-AV-1451, we examined reten-
tion patterns in cognitively normal older people in
relation to young controls and AD patients. Age and
b-amyloid (measured using PiB PET) were differen-
tially associated with tau tracer retention in healthy
aging. Older age was related to increased tracer
retention in regions of the medial temporal lobe,
which predicted worse episodic memory perfor-
mance. PET detection of tau in other isocortical re-
gions required the presence of cortical b-amyloid
and was associated with decline in global cognition.
Furthermore, patterns of tracer retention corre-
sponded well with Braak staging of neurofibrillary
tau pathology. The present study defined patterns
of tau tracer retention in normal aging in relation to
age, cognition, and b-amyloid deposition.
INTRODUCTION
Two pathological proteins that accumulate in the brains of
Alzheimer’s disease (AD) patients are b-amyloid (Ab) as amyloid
plaques, and hyperphosphorylated forms of the microtubule-
associated protein tau assembling into neurofibrillary tangles
(NFT). Neuropathological studies have repeatedly demonstrated
that these aggregated proteins also accumulate in the brains of
cognitively healthy older people (Bennett et al., 2006; Davis et al.,
1999). The temporal and regional relations of these proteins to
one another, to neurodegenerative processes, and to cognitive
function have been studied for decades with post-mortem
neuropathology (Braak and Braak, 1991; Braak et al., 2011; Price
and Morris, 1999; Tomlinson et al., 1968). These studies often
found normal aging to be associated with accumulation of tau
pathology in the form of NFTs in the medial temporal lobe, partic-
ularly perirhinal and entorhinal cortex even in the absence of Ab
(Braak et al., 2011). This condition was recently termed primary
age-related tauopathy (PART; Crary et al., 2014; Jellinger et al.,
2015), although PART has also been suggested to be part of
the AD spectrum (Duyckaerts et al., 2015). The spread of tau
outside MTL is usually associated with the co-occurrence of am-
yloid plaques (Price and Morris, 1999; Tomlinson et al., 1968).
Tau rather than Ab pathology has also been shown to be closely
related to cognition, predominantly memory decline, in post-
mortem studies of both aging and AD (Arriagada et al., 1992;
Ghoshal et al., 2002; Mitchell et al., 2002; Nelson et al., 2012;
Rolstad et al., 2013; van Rossum et al., 2012).
In a landmark publication, Braak and Braak (Braak and Braak,
1991) meticulously analyzed 83 brains and staged AD-related
pathology according to anatomical involvement patterns. Braak
stages of tau pathology, derived from cross-sectional data, pro-
pose how AD-related tau pathology may begin in medial tempo-
ral structures, namely transentorhinal cortex, then extend to
limbic areas of medial and inferior temporal lobe, to posterior
cingulate cortex, and then widely into isocortical brain areas.
These findings have been replicated (Braak et al., 2006; Braak
et al., 2011; Serrano-Pozo et al., 2011), and eventually incorpo-
rated into AD neuropathological criteria (Hyman et al., 2012).
The interactions between age, Ab, and tau accumulation have
previously only been studied in post-mortem brain tissue, in vivo
in animal models, or by using measures of total or hyperphos-
phorylated tau in cerebrospinal fluid (CSF). Existing data on tau
distribution are based on neuropathological observations that
represent a single endpoint in the disease process and have
limitations compared to in vivo findings. Studies also frequently
only sample selected brain regions and do not assess changes
across the brain related to age, Ab, or cognition (Braak et al.,
2006, 2011; Braak and Braak, 1991; Serrano-Pozo et al.,
2011). Conversely, CSF measures do not provide information
on spatial accumulation patterns. The advent of positron emis-
sion tomography (PET) tau ligands enables, for the first time,
tau pathology in living humans to be topographically mapped,
quantified, and examined in relation to other aspects of cognitive
aging.

 18F-AV-1451 (also known as 18F-T807) is a PET ligand with
high affinity for paired-helical filaments (PHFs), insoluble fibers
composed of hyper-phosphorylated tau. Post-mortem tissue
studies provided evidence that AV-1451 binds selectively to
PHF tau but not Ab or other common protein aggregates (Mar-
quie et al., 2015; Xia et al., 2013). Human studies indicate binding
patterns that parallel existing neuropathological staging of tau
and that increase in the presence of cognitive impairment and
dementia (Chien et al., 2013; Johnson et al., 2016).
Here, we examined in vivo the spatial extent of AV-1451 reten-
tion. One methodologic objective was to examine feasibility of
replicating the Braak staging approach to describe in vivo
tau accumulation patterns. Our overall goal was to explore rela-
tionships of the location of cortical tau ligand uptake with age,
cognition, and Ab deposition—as measured by the Ab-binding
ligand 11C-PiB (Price et al., 2005)—in cognitively healthy older
adults. Specifically, we hypothesized that AV-1451 uptake would
be independently associated with age and PiB retention, would
show negative relations to cognitive performance, and could
enable subject-specific pathology staging.
RESULTS
Participants
We included five healthy young adults (YA, aged 20–26) and
33 cognitively healthy older adults (OA, aged 64–90) from the
Berkeley Aging Cohort Study (BACS), and 15 patients with a
diagnosis of probable AD dementia (McKhann et al., 2011;
aged 53–77) from the University of California San Francisco
(UCSF) Memory and Aging Center (MAC). The AD sample
studied here (one participant diagnosed with behavioral/dysex-
ecutive variant of AD, one with early-onset amnestic AD, three
as late-onset amnestic AD, four with logopenic variant primary
progressive aphasia, and six with posterior cortical atrophy) clin-
ically does not represent a typical group of primarily late-onset
amnestic AD. However, our goal in the current study was to pro-
vide data representative of high, clinical levels of tau pathology
for the AV-1451 Braak staging procedure to be able to identify
thresholds, and we thus included a variety of AD phenotypes in
the AD participant sample.
Participant characteristics are provided in Table 1. Briefly,
mean age differed significantly between all groups, while educa-
tion levels were comparable. As expected, AD patients per-
formed significantly worse on the Mini Mental State Examination
(MMSE) than healthy participants.
Spatial Distribution of Tau
Figure 1 displays AV-1451 mean template space images for all
groups. YA participants did not show observable cortical uptake.
PiB-negative (PiB�) OA participants showed localized increases
in temporal lobe regions, in particular medial temporal subre-
gions (e.g., entorhinal cortex, parahippocampal gyrus), and in
some OA participants in inferior and lateral temporal cortical re-
gions. Uptake in PiB+ OA extended in most participants into infe-
rior and lateral temporal lobe (particularly fusiform gyrus and
inferior temporal cortex) and in some into lateral and medial pa-
rietal regions (including precuneus). Generally, elevated binding
in OA was found in regions corresponding to Braak stages I–IV
(see classification below). AD patients showed higher tracer
retention in neocortical regions, particularly throughout temporal
lobe, that also extended to encompass larger regions of parietal
and frontal cortex. Primary sensory and motor regions rarely
showed substantial tracer uptake, regardless of diagnostic sta-
tus. All participants showed tracer retention in midbrain; OA
and AD participants also showed retention in basal ganglia
and a region dorsal to the hippocampus corresponding to
choroid plexus. Uptake in these regions is thought to represent
‘‘off-target’’ binding of AV-1451 to targets other than tau (Mar-
quie et al., 2015; see Discussion for details).
AV-1451 Uptake in Braak ROIs and In Vivo Braak Staging
In an attempt to reproduce traditional Braak staging of tau pa-
thology based on neuropathological findings (Braak and Braak,
1991), we used weighted bilateral composite FreeSurfer-derived
regions of interests (ROIs) approximating the anatomical defini-
tions of transentorhinal (Braak stage I/II), limbic (III/IV), and iso-
cortical (V/VI) Braak stages (Table S1, Movies S1, S2, and S3).
In a first step, we examined AV-1451 retention within each group
of ROIs uncorrected for partial volume effect and found, as ex-
pected, substantial differences between all three diagnostic
groups (Figure 2A). Young adults had low uptake throughout all
Braak ROIs, while OA showed overall higher values and more
within-group variance. AD patients showed as expected the
highest values and greatest within-group variance. Group differ-
ences were greatest (p < 0.001) between AD patients and OA for
all Braak ROIs and between YA and OA in ‘‘early’’ Braak stage
ROIs I/II and III/IV. Results were similar after partial volume effect
correction (PVC) using the Geometric Transfer Matrix approach
(Rousset et al., 1998; Figure 2B). PVC produced only a small

 increase in the measurement of tracer retention in hippocampus,
but a large increase in choroid plexus signal adjacent to the hip-
pocampus, suggesting that choroid plexus PVC modeling may
aid in the estimation of actual AV-1451 signal in adjacent regions
such as hippocampus (Figure S1). For this reason, and because
PV-corrected data distinguished OA marginally better from AD
patients (Table S2), we used PV-corrected data in further native
space ROI analyses.
Next, we calculated thresholds to assign a Braak stage to each
participant based on Braak ROI AV-1451 uptake. We employed
a conditional inference tree approach that embeds decision tree-
structured regression models (Figure S2). In a first step, we
entered the whole dataset into the model classifying all partici-
pants based on Braak V/VI ROI uptake. We found 13 out of 15
AD patients above the threshold suggested by the regression
model (>2.79 mean SUVR); they were assigned Braak stage
V/VI. The remaining participants underwent the same procedure,
now using Braak III/IV ROI data. Two AD and six OA participants
were classified as Braak III/IV (>1.725). Finally, using Braak I/II
ROI data, 25 OA were classified as Braak I/II (>1.395), leaving 2
OA and the 5 YA in Braak stage 0. Figure 3 displays mean AV-
1451 images for the participants in different Braak stages. These
demonstrate clear progression of AV-1451 retention to inferior
and lateral temporal lobe followed by further progression to other
isocortical regions in final Braak stages. Characterizing partici-
pants according to their assigned Braak stage showed that
with increasing stage there was also increasing global PiB distri-
bution volume ratio (DVR) index (and proportion of PiB+ OA in
each group; note only OA and AD participants had PiB measure-
ments), increasing proportion of APOE ε4 allele carriers,
declining MMSE scores, and declining hippocampal volumes
(with the exception of AD patients in stage V/VI; hippocampal
volume derived from FreeSurfer 5.1 parcellation, see Experi-
mental Procedures). In healthy OA and YA, lower hippocampal
volume showed a statistically significant relationship with higher
Braak stage (Spearman’s rho �0.45, p = 0.005); APOE status
and PiB index exhibited too many missing values for meaningful
statistical analysis.
AV-1451 and Cognition in Cognitively Healthy Elderly
We explored relations of cross-sectional (closest to AV-1451
scan) and retrospective longitudinal cognition with AV-1451
Braak ROI uptake in healthy elderly using regression models co-
varying for age and sex. Longitudinal cognitive data were avail-
able for 30 OA, followed on average for 4.1 ± 2.2 years prior to
AV-1451 PET (4.0 ± 2.1 test sessions). Cognitive performance
was evaluated using factor scores for episodic memory, working
memory, processing speed, and an average of these domains as
a measure for global cognition.
For episodic memory, increased Braak I/II ROI tracer binding
predicted worse cross-sectional performance (b = �3.12,
p = 0.007) and retrospective longitudinal decline (slopes;
b = �0.06, p = 0.006; Figure 4A). Retrospective longitudinal
impairment in global cognition was related to higher AV-1451
uptake in all Braak ROIs (I/II: b = �0.013, p = 0.009; III/IV:
b = �0.015, p < 0.001; V/VI: b = �0.07, p = 0.007; Figure 4B).
Scores for cross-sectional global cognition, cross-sectional or
longitudinal working memory, and processing speed did not
show any statistically significant relationship with AV-1451. A
global mean AV-1451 retention measure (average of all Braak
ROIs) was also generated and found only to be correlated with
retrospective longitudinal change in global cognition. Crucially,
this global retention measure was not correlated with either
cross-sectional or longitudinal change in episodic memory (p =
0.7); only retention in Braak I/II ROIs was (as shown in Figure 4).
This global mean measure was furthermore only marginally
correlated with cortical PiB DVR (p = 0.08). We interpret these re-
sults as evidence that the regional characterization of tracer
retention using our Braak ROI approach captures more informa-
tion than does a global measure of AV-1451 retention.
To explore whether Ab pathology influenced the effect of tau
pathology on cognition, we added continuous cortical PiB DVR
data to the statistically significant regression models and exam-
ined whether the p value for the association between AV-1451
and cognition changed after adjusting for PiB. All models
remained significant except for the effect of Braak V/VI ROI
AV-1451 on longitudinal change in global cognition, which disap-
peared when PiB was added the model. We did not observe sta-
tistically significant interactions between PiB and AV-1451, likely
due to the small sample size. For the same reason, we refrained
from performing mediation or moderation analyses to further
explain directionalities.
We also explored direct relations between Ab and cognition
(Figure S3). Global PiB uptake was significantly associated with
longitudinal global cognition change (b = �0.09, p = 0.002).
When AV-1451 was added to the model, the effect survived

we
conducted
voxelwise
nonparametric regressions of both cross-sectional episodic
memory scores and longitudinal episodic memory slopes
against whole-brain AV-1451 data. We found significant associ-
ations between higher AV-1451 and both worse episodic mem-
ory scores and greater decline; these clusters were localized to
medial temporal lobe regions including parts of entorhinal cor-
tex, parahippocampal gyrus, and hippocampus (Figure 5).
Peak voxel MNI coordinates are reported in Table S3.
Voxelwise Associations between Age, PiB, and AV-1451
Accumulation among Cognitively Healthy Elderly
We used voxelwise nonparametric statistical tests to examine
associations between age, PiB DVR (global cortical ROI), and
AV-1451 accumulation. Statistical tests employed two thresh-
olds, one liberal (p < 0.005 uncorrected height and k R 100 voxel
cluster extent threshold) and one conservative (p < 0.05 family-
wise error-corrected [FWE] height threshold); by design, conser-
vative threshold results are not a subset of liberal results (see
Experimental Procedures). We found positive associations of
age with cortical AV-1451 accumulation (Figure 6A) and of PiB
with cortical AV-1451 accumulation (Figure 6B). The relation-
ships were independent of one another and spatially distinct.
Negative associations of age or PiB with AV-1451 were not
significant. Specifically, advancing age predicted AV-1451 accu-
mulation in MTL (entorhinal cortex, hippocampus, and parahip-
pocampal gyrus) and in ventral frontal cortex (basal forebrain)
and insula. Increasing Ab burden, however, predicted increased
AV-1451 in regions beyond medial temporal lobe, particularly
inferior and lateral temporal cortical regions, and medial and
lateral parietal and frontal cortex. The results found using a
combined uncorrected cluster and height threshold and with
family-wise error correction were spatially overlapping. Voxel-
wise results were similar when controlling for sex, education,
and gray matter volume as a proxy for cortical atrophy (data
not shown). MNI coordinates of significant voxels for each asso-
ciation are reported in Table S4.
ROI Analyses
Examination of regional relations between age, PiB, and AV-
1451 in temporal lobe subregions revealed spatially distinct
associations consistent with voxelwise findings; age and PiB
exhibited dissociable effects on AV-1451, with a medial-lateral
dissociation of effects of age and global PiB on temporal AV-
1451 (Figure 7). Significant associations between advancing
age and greater AV-1451 accumulation were only present in en-
torhinal cortex and parahippocampal gyrus and were diminished
in strength in more lateral regions. Conversely, associations be-
tween increasing global cortical PiB DVR and greater temporal
AV-1451 accumulation were marginally significant in entorhinal
cortex and increased in significance from parahippocampal gy-
rus to fusiform gyrus and inferior temporal cortex. Thus, from
medial to inferolateral temporal cortex, there existed inverse re-
lationships between age and AV-1451 and PiB and AV-1451.
DISCUSSION
In this study of cognitively healthy elderly people, we explored
uptake patterns of 18F-AV-1451, an in vivo PET biomarker for
accumulation of PHF tau, and examined the relationships of
regional and voxelwise tau accumulation with multiple factors.
We consistently observed that tau accumulation occurred in
anatomically specific patterns, in contrast to the more diffuse
nature of Ab deposition as measured with PiB PET. We also
demonstrated the ability to segregate participants based on
AV-1451 accumulation in specific Braak stages using a compu-
tational method. Furthermore, we found that AV-1451 was
related to cross-sectional and longitudinal cognitive measures
and that there were differences in the patterns associated with
age and Ab. Our results suggest that tau deposition, especially
in MTL, is an important aspect of cognitive aging that may
have behavioral consequences. They also suggest a relationship
between tau and Ab with implications for AD pathogenesis.
AV-1451 Uptake Patterns Are Present in the Healthy
Aging Brain and Enable In Vivo Braak Staging of Tau
Progression
The patterns of AV-1451 retention parallel findings in neuropath-
ological studies (Braak and Braak, 1991, 1997; Serrano-Pozo
et al., 2011), as well as a recent report indicating that the visual
appearance of AV-1451 retention parallels Braak staging (John-
son et al., 2016). Although regions sampled for Braak staging
may vary across neuropathology laboratories, our approach fol-
lowed the NIA-AA recommendations (Hyman et al., 2012) and
approximated the original and revised Braak stage definitions
(Braak and Braak, 1991; Braak et al., 2006). Furthermore, the
component regions that comprised these larger Braak ROIs

 followed a predictable pattern in relation to cognition and amy-
loid (Figure 7).
Young adults showed minimal brain uptake, even in subcor-
tical structures, consistent with Braak stage 0. The conditional
inference tree analysis consistently assigned them to Braak
0 based on low AV-1451 uptake. Although there is evidence of
tau accumulation in the young adult brainstem (Braak et al.,
2011), PET resolution is likely inadequate to detect this. Older
adults clearly showed tracer retention in medial temporal struc-
tures, with PIB+ individuals appearing to demonstrate more tau
deposition in inferior and lateral temporal neocortex. These vi-
sual patterns were confirmed with Braak staging. Using our clas-
sification approach, most OA were classified as Braak stage I/II
(76%), and a smaller proportion as Braak III/IV (18%) or stage 0
(6%); no healthy participants were classified as Braak stage V/VI.
These numbers are congruent with neuropathological findings;
Braak and Braak (Braak and Braak, 1997) reported 6% of all par-
ticipants aged 70–80 years (n = 605) in Braak stage 0, 64% in
Braak stage I/II, 25% in Braak stage III/IV, and 5% in Braak stage
V/VI. While these proportions do not reference cognitive status,
Bennett and colleagues (Bennett et al., 2006) examined 134
cognitively normal elderly (mean age at death 83 years) and
found 2% in Braak 0, 38% in Braak I/II, 56% in Braak III/IV,
and 4% in Braak V/VI. Although it is difficult to compare PET im-
aging with neuropathology, these results are in agreement with
few normal older individuals in stages 0 and V/VI and most
distributed between I/II and III/IV.
DifferencesbetweenADand healthyOAparticipantsweremore
substantial. AD participants showed elevated tracer retention in
early and middle Braak stage regions, and AD uptake patterns
frequently encompassed larger regions of medial and lateral pari-
etal and, to a lesser extent, frontal lobes. This was consistent with
Braak stage V/VI, which was confirmed by our in vivo Braak stag-
ing, assigning 13 AD patients to Braak stage V/VI and two to III/IV.

ditional Inference Trees

Braak stage. ICV, intracranial volume. Values for

These results have limitations. Our
threshold-calculation
approach
was
data driven and requires replication us-
ing separate cohorts to establish and
validate threshold values that will likely
differ. Nevertheless, these results pro-
vide proof-of-concept that in vivo Braak
staging using tau PET is possible in
cognitively healthy elderly. Further, by
characterizing participants according to
Braak stage, we also found, consistent
with previous findings (Braak and Braak,
1991, 1997; Braak et al., 2006, 2011;
Nelson et al., 2012; Serrano-Pozo et al., 2011), increasing
Braak stage in cognitively healthy and diseased participants
to be associated with increasing global amyloid burden,
increasing APOE ε4 allele positivity, declining cognition, and
reduced hippocampal volumes. The AD patients pose an
exception to the relationship between tau and hippocampal
volumes, perhaps because our AD group included many pa-
tients with early age of onset (mean age at PET 65) and non-
amnestic clinical presentations, both of which are associated
with neocortical-predominant neurodegeneration and relative
sparing of MTL in terms of both atrophy and tau burden (Murray
et al., 2011; Ossenkoppele et al., 2015a). In addition, age-
related hippocampal atrophy in our older control group (on
average 14 years older at PET than the AD group), may have
decreased our ability to detect a relationship between AV-
1451-defined Braak stage and hippocampal volumes in this
sample.
Ultimately, given the current approach, we cannot say that
participants characterized as Braak I/II are different from par-
ticipants characterized as Braak 0 only in the Braak stage I/II
ROIs. This is true for all the Braak stages in our approach:
those in higher stages may in fact have more generalized
AV-1451 deposition than those in lower stages. Our goal
was not to strictly duplicate neuropathological classification,
since
imaging
has
both
advantages
and
disadvantages
compared with neuropathology. The obvious disadvantage is
the poorer resolution of imaging, although the advantage is a
whole-brain view of the distribution of tau pathology. How-
ever, Figure 3 in particular makes it clear that the classification
of participants according to the 4 stages routinely used in
neuropathology does indeed capture distributions that reflect
medial temporal, limbic, and neocortical stages and that relate
to a progression along a spectrum from youth through aging to
dementia.

 Future attempts to replicate and extend this approach will
require more diverse and ‘‘intermediate’’ participants (e.g.,
middle-aged healthy individuals, patients with mild cognitive
impairment). It will be useful to investigate AV-1451 uptake using
a multivariate approach, to independently derive uptake patterns
and examine relations with Braak pathological staging; however,
we do not yet have enough participants to address this. Even
though this Braak ROI approach is tentative and despite its lim-
itations, the fact that the ROI-based and voxelwise approaches
showed similar relations with cognition and amyloid supports
the application of the Braak ROI staging. ROI-based analyses
furthermore allowed the use of PV-corrected data within native
space. This permits more specific measurements of tracer up-
take and direct testing of hypotheses, in contrast to more explor-
atory voxelwise methods.
Finally, the presumed off-target binding of this PET tracer in
brainstem, basal ganglia, and choroid plexus may pose quantita-
tion problems. The reason for this binding is unclear; while bind-
ing to MAO-A has been suggested, the results do not appear to
reflect the quantity and distribution of this enzyme in the brain
(Tong et al., 2013). Basal ganglia and midbrain binding are not
likely to interfere with cortical measurement. While choroid
plexus uptake complicates quantification in the hippocampus,
we were able to ameliorate this problem through partial volume
correction. Recent research has also suggested that neuromela-
nin or blood products may also contribute to AV-1451 signal
(Marquie et al., 2015).
Tau Is Differentially Associated with Age and Amyloid
Accumulation in OA
Tau pathology is near-universally present in aging (Bouras et al.,
1994; Braak et al., 2011) and, based on cross-sectional patho-
logical studies, may appear first in temporal lobe allocortex,
specifically MTL, remaining mostly confined to these regions
with moderate spread into neocortical temporal lobe and minor
spread into other neocortical areas with age (Braak and Braak,
1991; Braak et al., 1996; Guillozet et al., 2003; Price and Morris,
1999; Serrano-Pozo et al., 2011). In CSF, elevated levels of tau,
not altered levels of Ab42, are also strongly related with older
age in normal people (Sjo
¨ gren et al., 2001). Some pathologists
have suggested that this may represent PART (Crary et al.,
2014; Jellinger et al., 2015). In this model, accumulation of tau
pathology occurs steadily throughout life, often restricted to
MTL subregions such as entorhinal cortex and hippocampus,
with little presence of additional neuropathology besides medial
temporal atrophy (in the absence of substantial Ab accumula-
tion). The current findings of age-related increases in MTL tracer
binding are in concordance with the initial concept of PART,
including the relationship of hippocampal atrophy and MTL
tau and the relative lack of Ab deposition in individuals with
tau confined to MTL. However, the current findings do not
definitively support the idea that PART exists outside the AD
continuum (Duyckaerts et al., 2015), nor can we be certain
that there is a complete lack of neocortical tracer retention in
Ab-negative individuals.

 The spread of tau outside MTL has been associated with
increased Ab pathology (Braak et al., 2006; Braak and Braak,
1991), and models of biomarker change in AD suggest that Ab
aggregation may play a facilitating role in the disease patholog-
ical cascade (Jack et al., 2013). Conversely, tau is consistently
found in MTL regions before and in the absence of Ab pathology
(Crary et al., 2014; Fornicola et al., 2014; Price and Morris, 1999).
Among OA, we found that while advancing age predicted greater
tau accumulation in MTL and to some extent in ventral frontal
cortex (a region also known to show early tau accumulation;
Crary et al., 2014), increasing Ab burden predicted tau spread
outside medial temporal subregions into lateral and inferior tem-
poral as well as other neocortical regions (Figure 6).
Our results support a model suggesting two diverging path-
ways for tau pathology in aging: one proposing MTL tau pa-
thology as an effect of chronological age, another relating
cortical tau pathology to interactions with cortical Ab pathology
(Price and Morris, 1999; Small and Duff, 2008). Studies in cell
and transgenic mouse models suggest that tau in its harmful
hyperphosphorylated form spreads from entorhinal cortex,
likely in a trans-synaptic manner, along functional networks
and disrupts them, eventually causing neurodegeneration
(Fox et al., 2011; Liu et al., 2012; Menkes-Caspi et al., 2015).
Both tau and Ab cause synaptic damage in soluble and fibrillar
forms, individually and together (Spires-Jones and Hyman,
2014); where and how they interact and whether they enable
each other’s spread is still widely unknown, although APOE
allele status and GSK3 activity have, among others, been iden-
tified as potential upstream drivers linking together diverging
pathways (Small and Duff, 2008). A fundamental unanswered
question is whether Ab deposition facilitates tau spread outside
MTL, or whether tau spread outside MTL results in neocortical
Ab deposition.
Tau Is Associated with Cross-sectional and Longitudinal
Cognitive Measures in Healthy Aging
Tau and amyloid pathology reportedly also have diverging ef-
fects on cognition. Tau, particularly in MTL, is abundant in aging
and not exclusive to AD. Concordantly, episodic memory decline
is a common feature of normal aging (Deary et al., 2009).
Although MTL tau pathology at autopsy has consistently been
found more closely associated with cognition than has Ab (Arria-
gada et al., 1992; Bennett et al., 2012; Ghoshal et al., 2002;
Mitchell et al., 2002; Nelson et al., 2012; Rolstad et al., 2013),
the majority of these studies examined individuals with cognitive
impairment and dementia. The importance of MTL tau deposi-
tion in relation to memory decline seen in normal cognitive aging
is unclear. Notably, we found that cross-sectional and longitudi-
nal decline in performance in tests for episodic memory in OA
were strongly related to MTL tracer uptake in Braak ROI I/II,
seemingly independent of cortical amyloid pathology. Our re-
sults strengthen the hypothesis that tau pathology plays a key
role in memory decline in aging, which is also strongly related
to dysfunction of MTL structures (Tromp et al., 2015). A potential
caveat is that cognitive decline can be observed at a stage where
only a small number of MTL neurons are affected by tau pathol-
ogy (Hoover et al., 2010), and soluble and pre-NFT forms of tau
impair memory-consolidating hippocampal function; this must
be considered when interpreting tau PET data measuring PHF
tau. In addition, the results of our regression models were based
on a small sample and driven by a few influential data points but
were confirmed by nonparametric voxelwise analyses.
We also found decline in global cognition associated with tau
in all Braak ROIs, but the effect for cortical regions outside Braak
ROIs I–IV was related to the presence of cortical Ab. These re-
sults are in agreement with recent findings across a sample of
cognitively normal, mild cognitive impairment (MCI), and AD par-
ticipants that clinical impairment was associated with tracer
retention in inferior temporal cortex, which was also related to
mean cortical PIB (Johnson et al., 2016). This suggests that while
changes in episodic memory may be caused by age-related MTL
tau accumulation, longitudinal changes in global cognition may
be induced by synergistic effects of tau and Ab pathology
when both are present outside MTL regions. We also found
that global Ab was related to retrospective longitudinal decline
in global cognition, consistent with findings from a series of
studies using CSF and PET measures of Ab in relation to cogni-
tive performance (Fagan et al., 2007; Landau et al., 2012; Ville-
magne et al., 2013). The effect of Ab on global cognitive decline,
however, only remained statistically significant when Braak ROI
I/II, not Braak III-VI ROI data, were added to the respective
model, again suggesting that longitudinal cognitive decline in
our cohort cannot be explained by Ab or tau pathology alone.
Conclusions
These findings indicate that PHF-tau deposition can be tracked
by AV-1451 PET in living humans with results that confirm
and
extend
information
obtained
from
neuropathological
studies. The pattern of tracer retention is qualitatively similar
to tau deposition patterns reported in many autopsy studies.
In addition, we demonstrate the feasibility of pathological stag-
ing of living individuals for tau pathology and demonstrate

 dissociated relationships between age and Ab that support a
model of interaction between these proteins in AD pathogenesis.
The relationship between tau and cognition, even in cognitively
normal older people, suggests a crucial role for this protein in
aging, supporting the use of tau imaging in naturalistic studies
and therapeutic trials.
EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURES
Participants
We recruited 33 cognitively healthy older adults (OA) and five cognitively
healthy young adults (YA) from the Berkeley Aging Cohort Study (BACS), an
ongoing longitudinal study of cognitive aging. BACS eligibility requirements
included no MRI or PET contraindications, living independently in the commu-
nity, and normal performance on neuropsychological examination (see below
and Supplemental Experimental Procedures for details). Furthermore, 15 AD
patients were recruited from the UCSF MAC. All AD patients underwent stan-
dard dementia screening including medical history and physical examination,
caregiver interview, brain MRI, and neuropsychological testing; note the AD
sample studied here clinically does not represent a typical group (see Supple-
mental Experimental Procedures). Clinical diagnosis was established by
consensus in a multidisciplinary team; all AD patients fulfilled National Institute
on Aging-Alzheimer’s Association (NIA-AA) criteria for probable Alzheimer’s
disease (McKhann et al., 2011). One participant was diagnosed with behav-
ioral/dysexecutive variant of AD, one with early-onset amnestic AD, three
with late-onset amnestic AD, four with logopenic variant primary progressive
aphasia, and six with posterior cortical atrophy (Ossenkoppele et al., 2015b,
2015c). All participants underwent structural MRI, 11C-PiB, and 18F-AV-1451
PET imaging, and detailed neuropsychological assessment, as described
below. The Institutional Review Boards of all participating institutions
approved the study and informed consent was obtained from all participants.
YA and AD participants were used only in the Braak staging analysis.
PET Acquisition
[11C] Pittsburgh-B (PiB) was synthesized at the Lawrence Berkeley National
Laboratory (LBNL) Biomedical Isotope Facility (BIF), using a protocol
described in detail previously (Mathis et al., 2003). We conducted PiB PET im-
aging in 3D acquisition mode using either (OA n = 6) an ECAT EXACT HR scan-
ner or (OA n = 27, AD n = 14) a BIOGRAPH PET/CT Truepoint 6 scanner
(Siemens Medical Systems). Criteria for PiB positivity did not differ between
PET scanners used for PiB acquisition, and PiB PET DVR values have been
shown not to significantly differ between scanners (Elman et al., 2014). Imme-
diately after the intravenous injection of approximately 15 mCi of PiB, 90 min of
dynamic acquisition frames were obtained (4 3 15, 8 3 30, 9 3 60, 2 3 180,
10 3 300, and 2 3 600 s). For each PiB scan, a 10 min transmission scan or
a CT were obtained for attenuation correction. PiB PET images were recon-
structed using an ordered subset expectation maximization algorithm with
weighted attenuation and smoothed with a 4 mm Gaussian kernel with scatter
correction.
18F-AV-1451 (T807) PET imaging was performed within 0 and 335 days of
PiB PET. AV-1451 was also synthesized at the LBNL BIF using a GE TracerLab
FXN-Pro synthesis module with a modified protocol based on that supplied
by Avid radiopharmaceuticals. AV-1451 PET imaging was conducted on
the BIOGRAPH PET/CT scanner. Participants were injected with 10 mCi of
tracer and participated in one of two acquisition schemes: full dynamic scans
(YA n = 5, OA n = 23, AD n = 11; 0–100 min post injection with 4 3 15, 8 3 30,
9 3 60 s, and 2 3 3, 16 3 5 min frames; and 120–150 min, 6 3 5 min frames), or
75–115 min scans (OA n = 10, AD n = 4; 8 3 5 min frames). A CT scan was per-
formed before the start of each emission acquisition. For all analyses, we used
SUVR data collected from 80–100 min, determined to be the best time frame
and processing scheme for a range of clinical diagnoses studied using
this tracer in separate pharmacokinetic studies (e.g., Chien et al., 2013).
AV-1451 PET images were reconstructed using an ordered subset expectation
maximization algorithm with weighted attenuation and smoothed with a 4 mm
Gaussian kernel with scatter correction.
MRI Acquisition
All cognitively healthy participants (YA and OA) underwent MRI on a 1.5T
Siemens Magnetom Avanto scanner at LBNL; this session included a high-res-
olution T1-weighted magnetization prepared rapid gradient echo (MPRAGE)
scan (TR/TE = 2110/3.58 ms, FA = 15�, 1 3 1 3 1 mm resolution). All AD pa-
tients underwent MRI at the UCSF Neuroimaging Center on a 3T Siemens
Tim Trio scanner; this session included a 1 3 1 3 1 mm resolution T1-weighted
MPRAGE that was acquired as described previously (Ossenkoppele et al.,
2015a).
PET Image Processing
PiB data were realigned, and frames corresponding to the first 20 min of acqui-
sition were averaged and coregistered to the participant’s structural MRI. Dis-
tribution volume ratios (DVRs) for PiB images were created using Logan graph-
ical analysis (35–90 min postinjection) and a gray matter masked cerebellum
reference region (Logan et al., 1996; Price et al., 2005). DVR voxelwise images
were created, and global cortical PiB DVR (‘‘global PiB’’) values, derived using
native space FreeSurfer-derived cortical gray matter masks, were calculated
for each participant for use in analyses and classification of PiB positivity (Mor-
mino et al., 2011). Participants were described as PiB positive if their global PiB
DVR was at or above a selected threshold of 1.06, and PiB negative otherwise;
this threshold is adapted from previous thresholds developed in our laboratory
to examine early amyloid positivity in healthy controls (Mormino et al., 2012).

 For AV-1451 scanning, we recruited equal numbers of OA participants above
and below this PiB value. However, no primary hypotheses involved PiB status.
AV-1451 data were realigned, and the mean of all frames was used to cor-
egister AV-1451 data to each participant’s MRI. For the separate acquisition
schemes, we used separate coregistration approaches. When available, we
used 0–150 min data for participants with full dynamic scans and 80–100
data for participants with only 75–115 min scans. Coregistration approach
(0–150 versus 80–100 min) did not differentially affect ROI segmentation. We
created AV-1451 standardized uptake value (SUV) images based on mean
uptake over 80–100 min postinjection normalized to uptake in a gray matter
masked cerebellum reference region to create voxelwise SUV ratio (SUVR)
images in each participant’s MRI native space.
MRI Processing
T1 MPRAGE scans were processed as described previously using FreeSurfer
version 5.1 (http://surfer.nmr.mgh.harvard.edu/) (Mormino et al., 2009). Free-
Surfer was used to delineate anatomical ROI masks for multiple brain regions
on the native space MRI (coregistered to the PET scans); segmentations were
manually checked for accuracy. The gray matter cerebellum mask used as a
reference region for PiB and AV-1451 PET was derived in this way. MRI images
were also segmented into brain tissue types using SPM8 (http://www.fil.ion.
ucl.ac.uk/spm) and a global gray matter (GM) volume value was calculated
per participant by identifying and summing all brain voxels with gray matter
probability >0.5 for use as a covariate of no interest in specific analyses.
In Vivo Braak Staging Data Preprocessing
Following coregistration of AV-1451 PET images to MRI, and parcellation by
FreeSurfer, we employed the Geometric Transfer Matrix approach according
to Rousset (Rousset et al., 1998) for partial volume correction (PVC) of ROI
data (see Figure S1 and Supplemental Experimental Procedures for details).
We then created bilateral Braak stage ROIs that anatomically approximated
the Braak staging regions of AD-related tau pathology, following descriptions
from previous publications (Alafuzoff et al., 2008; Braak et al., 2006, 2011;
Braak and Braak, 1991). Braak ROIs were created by combining FreeSurfer
ROIs into non-overlapping Braak regions I/II, III/IV, and V/VI. Braak stage
ROI composition is listed in Table S1; 3D renderings of the Braak stage
ROIs are shown in Movies S1, S2, and S3. Braak stage ROIs I/II corresponded
to the transentorhinal stage, III/IV to the limbic stage, and V/VI to the isocortical
Braak stage. Braak ROI values were extracted taking ROI-volume-weighted
averages of AV-1451 retention in each Braak region.
Voxelwise AV-1451 Data Preprocessing
To examine voxelwise associations of AV-1451 with chronological age, global
PiB, and cognition, we warped MRI scans for all OA (n = 33) to the FSL MNI152
2 mm space template (http://www.fmrib.ox.ac.uk/fsl). Normalization was per-
formed using Advanced Normalization Tools (ANTS; http://stnava.github.io/
ANTs/) with the use of a study-specific intermediate template created from
the 33 BACS OA. Results were similar when using SPM8 for group normaliza-
tion. After estimating linear and nonlinear transformations from each native

 space into MNI152 space, transformations were concatenated and applied
to the MRI and coregistered AV-1451 PET images. To allow us to focus on
cortical AV-1451 binding patterns (as some off-target binding is known to
occur in subcortical regions, see Figure 1), we employed a FreeSurfer segmen-
tation on the MNI152 template structural MRI, and created a mask using all
cortical brain regions. To reduce contributions of CSF and noise to the anal-
ysis, we filtered out likely CSF voxels at the gray matter/CSF boundary in tem-
plate space (coefficient of variation [CoV] of AV-1451 data thresholded R
0.25). A testing mask (i.e., voxels highly likely to be cortical gray matter) was
created from the resulting image. AV-1451 images were then masked and
smoothed by a 4 mm FWHM kernel before analysis.
Neuropsychological Examination
Cross-sectional (closest to AV-1451 scan) and retrospective longitudinal (prior
to AV-1451 scan) neuropsychological data of the BACS OA were employed in
this study. Thirty out of 33 OA had longitudinal data, with 4.0 ± 2.2 testing ses-
sions over a period of 4.1 ± 2.2 years. For each testing session, factor scores
were calculated for episodic memory, working memory, and executive func-
tion/processing speed domains using a maximum likelihood analysis adjusted
for test results from a larger sample of 346 BACS OA participants (see Supple-
mental Experimental Procedures for details). In addition, a global cognition
measure was created as an average of the three factor scores.
To assess change in cognition over time, slopes of change in the respective
cognitive domain were generated using a linear mixed effects model (Fig-
ure S5). Random effects included inter-individual intercept and time between
neuropsychological examinations. No fixed effects were included as potential
covariates were included in subsequent analyses.
Statistical Analysis
In Vivo Braak Staging Based on AV-1451 Uptake
To create thresholds allowing assignment of Braak stages to individuals based
exclusively on native space AV-1451 PET ROI data, we employed conditional
inference tree analysis (Figure S2; using R [v. 3.1.2]; Ihaka and Gentleman,
1996), and the package party and its function ctree. Ctree performs nonpara-
metric binary recursive partitioning using the following steps: (1) test the global
null hypothesis of independence between any input variables and the
response (which may be multivariate as well), and stop if this hypothesis
cannot be rejected. Otherwise select the input variable with strongest associ-
ation to the response. This association is measured by a p value corresponding
to a test for the partial null hypothesis of a single input variable and the
response. (2) Implement a binary split in the selected input variable. (3) Recur-
sively repeat steps (1) and (2).
ROI-Based Association of AV-1451 Uptake and Cognitive Measures
Least-squares regression was employed to explore the direct effect of AV-
1451 uptake in Braak stage ROIs on cross-sectional and retrospective change
in cognitive performance in OA (n = 33). We adjusted models for age and sex to
avoid bias; the effect of education was found to be non-significant and thus not
modeled. All tests were two-sided, with significance determined at p < 0.05;
the term ‘‘effect’’ was used as per statistical convention to describe associa-
tions between variables. All analyses were done using R (v. 3.2.1). We also
examined whether the p value for the association between AV-1451 and cogni-
tion changed from significant to non-significant when adjusting for PiB.
Furthermore, we explored the reverse relationship, i.e., the direct effect of
PiB on cognition and the change in significance of this model when Braak
ROI AV-1451 data was added to the model.
Voxelwise Association of AV-1451 Uptake with Cognitive Measures
Template space voxelwise nonparametric regressions (FSL randomise;
threshold-free cluster enhancement [TFCE]; 50,000 permutations; cortical
mask described above) tested where AV-1451 binding was related to cognitive
factor scores and slopes in OA. Voxelwise analyses were conducted with
terms of age and sex included in the model. Voxelwise cognitive results are
presented with a p < 0.005 (uncorrected) height plus 100 voxel cluster extent
threshold.
Voxelwise Associations of Age and Global PiB with AV-1451 Uptake
Template space voxelwise nonparametric regressions (FSL randomise; TFCE;
50,000 permutations; cortical mask described above) tested where AV-1451
binding was related to age or PiB in OA (see plot of age versus PiB DVR in Fig-
ure S4, and mean AV-1451 images by PiB level in Movie S4). Voxelwise ana-
lyses were conducted with terms of chronological age and global PiB DVR
in the model. Voxelwise results are presented with both a p < 0.005 (uncorrec-
ted) height plus 100 voxel cluster extent (‘‘liberal’’) threshold, and with a
p < 0.05 (FWE-corrected) height (‘‘conservative’’) threshold. The use of com-
bined voxel and cluster-extent thresholds, and the use of TFCE, means that
conservative threshold results are not exclusively a subset of liberal results;
this was done in order to better understand the spatial pattern of AV-1451 re-
sults. Finally, ROI analyses on template space AV-1451 data (using FreeSurfer-
segmented ROIs in MNI152 template space) used MATLAB to assess relations
of age or PiB DVR (linear regression) with bilateral mean ROI AV-1451 signal.
