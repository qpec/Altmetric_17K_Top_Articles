Abstract
Background: Depression in the workplace creates a significant burden on employees and employers in terms of lost productivity
and related costs. myStrength provides a robust, holistic Web- and mobile-based solution empowering users to learn, practice,
and implement a range of evidence-based psychological interventions.
Objective: The main aim of this study was to demonstrate improvement in depressive symptoms among employees at risk of
depression through myStrength use.
Methods: A 26-week, parallel-arm, pilot, randomized controlled trial was designed to assess the effectiveness of myStrength
compared to a series of informational “Depression Tip/Fact of the Week” emails as the active control arm. Study participants
(n=146) were commercially insured employees of a mid-sized financial software solutions firm. The primary outcome was
self-reported change in depression score as best fit by a linear random effects model accounting for individual baseline symptoms.
Results: The final sample consisted of 78 participants in the experimental arm, myStrength, and 68 participants in the active
control arm. myStrength users demonstrated significantly steeper and more rapid reduction in depressive symptoms over time
compared to the active control (P<.001), suggesting that the intervention generated improvement in behavioral health symptoms,
even in a nonclinical sample.
Conclusions: This pilot study builds foundational support for the scalable deployment of myStrength as a complementary
behavioral health offering to promote overall mental health and well-being in the workplace.

Introduction
Identifying tools to manage both clinical and subclinical
depression in an effective and broad-reaching manner could
have widespread benefits. Depression is one of the most
common and debilitating disorders in the United States [1]. In
2014, 6.7% of American adults aged 18 years or older (15.7
million people) had at least one major depressive episode [2].
Such episodes can result in significant impairments in home
life, work function, and social relationships.
Depression in the workplace poses a significant burden to both
employees and employers. A nationally representative,
epidemiologic survey found that 6.4% of employees in the

 workplace had depression; of those, 13.8% were classified mild,
38.5% moderate, and 47.7% as severe [3,4]. Depression is also
a major cost driver for employers [5,6]. Depression annually
costs US businesses over $51 billion in absenteeism from work
and lost productivity on top of the $26 billion in direct treatment
costs [7].
US employers looking for ways to manage the cost burden of
depression in the workplace are increasingly turning to
cutting-edge platforms to provide real-time access to care [8,9].
One way to bend the cost curve is to broaden the reach of
preventative interventions to engage people both with clinical
levels of depression and those demonstrating subthreshold
depressive symptoms before symptoms and associated costs
elevate [10-13].
One cost-effective way to provide such preventative care for
depression 
is 
via 
Web-based 
interventions 
[14,15].
Computerized cognitive behavioral therapy (cCBT) for treating
clinical depression has been well validated in efficacy trials
[12,16]. Likewise, randomized controlled trials (RCTs) suggest
that the positive impacts from online tools for people diagnosed
with clinical depression also extend to those with milder
symptoms [17,18]. Interestingly, a growing body of literature
suggests that the greatest impact of cCBT is found among users
who might not seek out or have access to other standard
treatment options like talk therapy [19-21].
In developing an appropriate digital platform to be used for
broad, cost-effective, employer-based outreach, scalability and
low price point per user are paramount. At the same time, past
research suggests that having a guided component to Internet
interventions improves engagement and outcomes [22,23]. In
an era where Web and mobile apps can be customized to the
individual user, it is possible that such customization could help
to increase engagement and impact without elevating program
costs as with guided interventions.
myStrength, the Web and mobile self-care platform piloted in
this study, is designed to close the behavioral health care
treatment gap by extending access to empirically validated
psychological interventions through a population-based approach
[24]. myStrength builds on existing Web-based cCBT for
clinical depression by incorporating wrap-around brief resources
from mindfulness approaches, acceptance and commitment
therapy, brief strategic therapies, and motivational interviewing
while offering a unique set of programmatic recommendations
to each user based on a profile process. The population health
approach taken allows for the deployment and evaluation of
psychological interventions in a real-world setting for
employer-based depression management.
For the past 6 years, myStrength has been delivering
evidence-based psychological interventions to users affiliated
with over 100 mental health providers, ranging from large
national health insurance providers to community mental health
clinics. This pilot study is the first of its kind to rigorously
evaluate the impact and effectiveness of myStrength in terms
of depressive symptom burden reduction in a real-world setting.
Methods
Study Design
A 26-week, parallel-arm RCT with a single pretest and three
posttests was piloted to examine the impact of myStrength use
on self-reported depression symptom burden. This design was
selected in accordance with the Pretest-Posttest Control Group
Design with Multiple Substantive Posttests recommended by
Shadish et al [25]. See the study flowchart in Figure 1, including
an overview of the enrollment process and assessment timing.

Study Participants and Recruitment
Participants were recruited from the 5567 commercially insured
employees of a financial software solutions company. The study
was conducted in partnership with Aetna, the company’s health
benefits provider, and was open to all employees. Participants
were excluded if they were under 18 years of age; were
diagnosed with Alzheimer disease, Parkinson disease, dementia,
delirium, 
or 
other 
cognitive 
impairment; 
had 
been
institutionalized; or were diagnosed with obsessive-compulsive
disorder because in each of these cases there were concerns
raised by the sponsoring entity about the potential for adverse
events in an unmonitored setting.
An executive recruitment email was sent out to all employees
by the company’s head of human resources inviting individuals
to voluntarily participate in the pilot of new tools for managing
mood and stress. Two follow-up recruitment emails were sent
out, with 5 days between each email. Participants were told
there were two arms of the study intended to improve mental
health during informed consent: (1) an interactive website and
(2) receipt of an email series.
Interested participants accessed an online enrollment screener
and completed informed consent. On the first page of this
screening, potential participants were asked if they met any of
the exclusion criteria. Those who endorsed exclusion criteria
were redirected to a general resources page and not permitted
to continue registration for the study. Because each employee
received a unique email link to the registration survey, this
redirect also meant people could not return and alter their
responses.
Intervention Group
The experimental arm was given access to myStrength, a Web-
and mobile-based behavioral health and wellness support tool.
The myStrength platform delivers tailored wellness content to
present a diversity of evidence-based interactive resources.
myStrength resources include the following: cCBT modules for
depression and anxiety, mindfulness and other empirically
validated tools taught via short form video, substance use
motivational interviewing and relapse prevention modules, a
mood tracker, community and personal inspirations, motivational
quotes, spiritual and faith-based resource if users elect to receive
these, and a searchable library of over 1600 additional mental
health and wellness resources. In addition, participants in the
experimental arm received a series of 12 emails highlighting
different aspects of myStrength and specific tools for managing
depression, as well as reminders to access the platform.
Participants could access any of the resources available on the
myStrength website and mobile platform at their own pace and
at any time during the 26-week study period. Multimedia
Appendices 1 and provide visual representations of the
myStrength Web and mobile interface.
Active Control Group
The active control arm received 12 “Tip/Fact of the Week”
emails with factual statements about mental health or depression
during the 26-week study period. Emails were designed to
contain accurate information pertaining to depression signs and
symptoms without offering clinical suggestions or advice (for
example, see Multimedia Appendix 3).
Outcome Measures
The primary outcome measure was the depression subscale
score (range 0 to 42) of the Depression, Anxiety, and Stress
Scale (DASS-21), a 21-item validated self-report questionnaire

 designed to measure symptom severity [26]. Participants in both
the experimental and active control arms followed the same
assessment schedule. Each participant completed an assessment
at enrollment (T1) and were prompted by email reminders to
be reassessed at 14, 60, and 180 days (T2-T4, respectively).
Demographic information collected included gender, age, level
of education, ethnicity, and mental health treatment status.
Randomization and Blinding
A randomized design was selected to prospectively assess the
impact of myStrength use on the primary outcome, depression
score over time. The online survey software, FluidSurveys,
consented and randomly assigned study participants to either
the intervention arm or active control. Per institutional review
board (IRB) review and approval, study participants knew of
their study arm assignment; however, they were unaware that
the active control did not include platform access.
Randomization occurred after prescreening for eligibility and
informed consent and thus recruited a study population more
open to help-seeking. The study employed a sampling ratio of
1.5:1 with no stratification and with the larger number of
individuals assigned to the experimental arm. This approach
was taken to sufficiently power the experimental arm, as those
study participants engaged with myStrength were required to
complete the extra step of accessing the website and completing
registration for the program. The active control arm had no
similar post-enrollment burden.
Statistical Analyses
Data analyses were conducted using R version 3.3.2 (The R
Foundation). The primary outcome, depression score, was
analyzed using mixed effects regression. A random-intercept
was modeled to account for individual baseline variation.
Predictors included study arm (group), a continuous measure
of time (days since baseline; time), and the interaction of group
and time (group × time). Covariates included gender, age group,
and a baseline indicator of whether the participant was receiving
treatment outside the study as measured by self-report at T1
(receiving treatment). In addition, each regression model
adjusted for the corresponding baseline T1 outcome assessment
(depression).
Ethics
All data collected were retained by the experimenters and no
individual-level data were shared with Aetna Inc or the
employer. Likewise, myStrength, the intervention offered in
the experimental arm, stores all responses in a manner compliant
with the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act.
This pilot study was not prospectively registered on
Clinicaltrials.gov given the original intent to demonstrate
feasibility. This research was reviewed and approved by Sterling
IRB #4959.
Results
Participant Flow and Outlier Consideration
As depicted in Figure 1, the recruitment email was sent out to
the census of 5567 employees. Among them, 449 (8.1%)
completed the online enrollment screening, 26 (5.8%) of whom
did not meet eligibility criteria and were excluded. The
randomization sample comprised 165 screened individuals
(39.0%) who met the eligibility criteria and signed informed
consent to participate. Randomization resulted in 96 participants
in the experimental arm (58.2%) and 69 participants in the active
control arm (41.8%).
Of 96 experimental study participants, 12 (12.5%) failed to
complete registration. Case review revealed their data to be
particularly sparse with regard to outcomes and covariates. Only
3 of 12 had any outcome data available, typically a single
response on the third occasion. For that reason, study
participants who failed to complete registration were omitted
from the primary analyses, and the effective sample size was
reduced from 165 to 153. Acknowledging the a priori goal of
analyzing the data by intention to treat, this pilot study was
unable to impute the missing data due to sparseness.
Despite random assignment to study group, between-group
differences on the DASS-21 depression score at baseline (T1)
were identified and subsequently removed from all analyses. A
total of 7 statistical outliers (6 in the experimental group and 1
in the active control group) were identified as 1.5 I beyond the
upper or lower quartile, where I is the interquartile range.
Descriptive statistics and regression models were conducted
with and without the inclusion of outliers and the interpretation
of findings was consistent.
To demonstrate the impact of outlier inclusion on the average
depression score over time, a side-by-side comparison of the
study population with and without the outliers identified at
baseline is presented. Figure 2 shows the average depression
score over time for both the experimental and active control
arms with the 7 statistical outliers included. Figure 3 shows the
average depression score over time for both the experimental
and active control arms with the outliers removed. Clear
separation in depression scores was observed between the
experimental arm and active control at baseline; however, the
experimental arm with the outliers included (n=84) is skewed
in favor of more severe depressive symptom burden as compared
to the trimmed experimental arm with the outliers removed
(n=78). Given the intent of the pilot study to assess the feasibility
of myStrength to favorably impact depressive symptoms in a
relatively healthy employee population, the statistical outliers
were removed from all further analyses.
Efforts were made to maintain participant engagement
throughout the study and collect data for all measures on all
occasions. Recent research on Internet-based depression
interventions report variable adherence to study arm protocols
and often experience high dropout rates [27,28]. Melville et al
[27] synthesized 19 peer-reviewed studies referencing attrition
among Internet-based behavioral health treatment interventions.
Study dropout rates ranged from 2% to 83% and on average,
31% of study participants prematurely exited studies. Given
that the pilot study described here was intended to mirror an
unguided, real-world design, there was no human outreach
component or offer of any financial incentive to increase study
participation. Data were missing due to intermittent responses
as well as some permanent dropout; all partial data were
included in analyses. The overall attrition rate was 62% with

Primary Analyses
The primary outcome of interest is change in depression score
over time. As shown in Table 2, both the experimental and
active control study participants experienced a reduction in
depressive symptoms over time. Given that group membership
was assigned after informed consent was obtained, it is
hypothesized that the pilot study population was more open to
help-seeking/treatment than the general population. Also,
depressive symptoms, especially mild ones, are well established
to eventually decrease even without intervention on their own

The rate of depression symptom burden improvement was
further tested by linear mixed effects regression modeling. A
random intercept model was selected to account for individual
baseline depression symptoms, and model findings are
summarized in Table 3. The intercept is statistically significant,
underscoring the importance of taking into account personal
depression trajectories (b coefficient=4.27, P<.001). Receiving
mental health treatment, such as outpatient therapy or taking
antidepressant medication, was found to be an independent
predictor of depression score reduction over time (b
coefficient=–1.13, P=.026). The main effect of time was found
to be statistically significant, meaning that in general, a 0.83
reduction in depression score was achieved at each time point
(b coefficient=–0.83, P=.002). This main effect finding is
qualified by the interaction group × time (b coefficient=–1.35,
P<.001). Taking into account potential confounders, the
experimental arm experienced an accelerated trajectory of
depression symptom reduction to a factor of 1.35 times faster
than the active control arm.

Discussion
Principal Findings
Findings from this pilot study support the feasibility of
delivering impactful Web- and mobile-based depression
interventions directly to employees. This innovative partnership
brought together a large commercial health insurance provider,
a mid-sized US corporation, and a self-help platform provider
of behavioral health and wellness to empower employees with
effective self-care tools.
Principal findings suggest that while participants in both study
arms experienced improvement in depression symptoms, the
experimental arm achieved those favorable results faster and to
a greater degree than the active control arm. Within 2 weeks of
study enrollment, depression score differences between the two
groups emerged with more rapid improvement over time for
those participants in the experimental arm. While mean symptom
levels began to converge by the 6-month assessment, study
participants in the experimental group spent less time being
symptomatic compared to the active control group.
In addition, this research supports the premise that
evidence-based Web and mobile behavioral health interventions

 are a viable way to reach employees coping with depressive
symptoms who might not otherwise seek out behavioral health
care. As seen in Table 1, almost two-thirds of all study
participants received no mental health treatment, despite being
identified as at risk of depression. This pilot study demonstrated
the ability to reach and impact a volunteer, help-seeking
population who in the majority of cases were not using other
available services. At the same time, the study showed
considerable attrition over time. While we hypothesized that
individual-level profile-based personalization of the program
would drive retention, it appears further work is necessary to
overcome this hurdle in order to maximize value from a
low-cost, highly scalable, nonguided intervention.
Limitations
This work has several notable limitations. First, due to the
real-world, 
nonincentivized 
methodology, 
there 
was
considerable attrition across the pilot study. Barring imputation,
we employed statistical approaches that model and control for
such attrition; however, it is always possible that subjects lost
to follow-up were qualitatively different from those providing
follow-up data. If nonresponders in the experimental arm were
more likely to drop out of the study, this would certainly have
biased the results. Future research building on this pilot study
will seek to balance the real-world intent of the program with
the possibility of offering incentivized outbound calling or
weekly text message reminders to improve study retention.
Selection of a proper control condition is always challenging
in behavioral health research. Because participants in such
behavioral health research inherently know their assigned
intervention arm (myStrength or email series in this case), a
well-designed study must incorporate an active control that is
equally appealing to participants as the intervention, while not
containing the key active ingredients of the intervention [29].
One measure of the effectiveness of an active control is to look
for between-group differences in terms of satisfaction with the
treatment provided. We asked all participants to rate their
satisfaction in each study arm at each reassessment interval.
Overall, 93% of study participants in the experimental arm and
73% of study participants who received the active control
reported that they were engaged or highly engagement in email
campaigns. Given the high satisfaction rates across both groups,
the active control email series was considered to be a viable
control condition. It was hypothesized that depressive symptom
improvement would be achieved in both the experimental and
active control groups, given the episodic nature of depression.
Research findings substantiated this hypothesized outcome.
In addition, it is possible that myStrength may have variable
impact on depression scores among real-world users. Study
participants in the experimental arm were required to complete
informed consent to participate in this pilot program and
theoretically may have been more motivated to use and benefit
from such a platform. With only one-third of the total employee
population opting to complete informed consent, we have no
additional information on those who chose not to participate to
test for selection bias. Building on these early findings, an
observational study is planned to understand the real-world
uptake and use of myStrength to minimize this bias.
Finally, the identification and removal of statistical outliers in
both study arms at baseline (T1) warrants acknowledgment.
Following widely accepted measurement methodology for the
identification of outliers, the removal of 7 total outliers was
justified. However, the fact that the experimental arm
overindexed in outliers might suggest that randomization failed
to generate completely equivalent groups—an occurrence that
can happen despite randomization. Given the small, pilot nature
of this study, future research will employ larger sample sizes
to avoid this potential shortcoming.
Conclusions
The results of this pilot study highlight the promise of
incorporating self-care tools such as myStrength into the
portfolio of behavioral health care offerings. Web and mobile
tools are considered complementary, add-on offerings and are
not intended to replace face-to-face therapy but rather to expand
access to care and to deliver services with lower barriers to entry
directly to employees. These preliminary study findings support
larger scale efforts to evaluate if employers and their employees
could benefit from incorporating an easily accessible and readily
available self-care platform to address behavioral health needs.
The myStrength platform may serve as a “just in time” responder
preventing mild symptoms from erupting into full-blown clinical
depression while easing entry into professional care for those
employees grappling with the perceived stigma around diagnosis
and seeking treatment. Likewise, the results presented here also
suggest that Web and mobile platforms may be a powerful tool
for reducing productivity loss due to subclinical behavioral
health concerns. myStrength provides low-threshold access to
information and evidence-based tools, which could help
employees immediately in the short term while also, where
appropriate, guiding employees to recognize the need for
additional care and avoid costly treatment in the long term.
