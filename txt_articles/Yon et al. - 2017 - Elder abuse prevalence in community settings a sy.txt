Elder abuse prevalence in community settings: a systematic 
review and meta-analysis
Yongjie Yon, Christopher R Mikton, Zachary D Gassoumis, Kathleen H Wilber
Summary
Background Elder abuse is recognised worldwide as a serious problem, yet quantitative syntheses of prevalence studies 
are rare. We aimed to quantify and understand prevalence variation at the global and regional levels.
Methods For this systematic review and meta-analysis, we searched 14 databases, including PubMed, PsycINFO, 
CINAHL, EMBASE, and MEDLINE, using a comprehensive search strategy to identify elder abuse prevalence studies in 
the community published from inception to June 26, 2015. Studies reporting estimates of past-year abuse prevalence in 
adults aged 60 years or older were included in the analyses. Subgroup analysis and meta-regression were used to explore 
heterogeneity, with study quality assessed with the risk of bias tool. The study protocol has been registered with 
PROSPERO, number CRD42015029197.
Findings Of the 38 544 studies initially identifi
 ed, 52 were eligible for inclusion. These studies were geographically diverse 
(28 countries). The pooled prevalence rate for overall elder abuse was 15·7% (95% CI 12·8–19·3). The pooled prevalence 
estimate was 11·6% (8·1–16·3) for psychological abuse, 6·8% (5·0–9·2) for fi
 nancial abuse, 4·2% (2·1–8·1) for neglect, 
2·6% (1·6–4·4) for physical abuse, and 0·9% (0·6–1·4) for sexual abuse. Meta-analysis of studies that included overall 
abuse revealed heterogeneity. Signifi
 cant associations were found between overall prevalence estimates and sample size, 
income classifi
 cation, and method of data collection, but not with gender.
Interpretation Although robust prevalence studies are sparse in low-income and middle-income countries, elder abuse 
seems to aff
 ect one in six older adults worldwide, which is roughly 141 million people. Nonetheless, elder abuse is a 
neglected global public health priority, especially compared with other types of violence.

Introduction
Elder abuse is a serious human rights violation that 
requires urgent action. 
1 It is also a major public health 
problem that results in serious health consequences for 
the victims, including increased risk of morbidity, 
mortality, institutionalisation, and hospital admission, 
and has a negative eff
 ect on families and society at 
large.2–4 Despite the severity of its consequences, major 
gaps remain in estimating the prevalence of elder abuse.
Understanding the magnitude of elder abuse is a crucial 
fi
 rst step in the public health approach to prevent this type 
of violence.5 However, the lack of consensus in defi
 ning and 
measuring elder abuse and its major subtypes (psycho-
logical, physical, sexual, and fi
 nancial abuse and neglect) 
have resulted in wide variations in reported prevalence 
rates. For example, national estimates of past-year abuse 
prevalence rate ranged between 2·6% in the UK6 and 4% in 
Canada7 to 18·4% in Israel8 and 29·3% in Spain.9
To date, only a handful of studies have synthesised 
results of elder abuse prevalence studies, and few have 
done so quantitatively. Cooper and colleagues’10 global 
estimate is one in 17, or 6%, in the past month. This 
estimate was based on individual studies selected as best 
evidence. Dong’s systematic review11 ranged from 2·2% 
to 79·7% and covered fi
 ve continents, with large 
geographic variations that might stem from cultural, 
social, or methodological diff
 erences. Given the large 
number of prevalence studies published over the past 
decade and the absence of global quantitative estimates 
of the prevalence of elder abuse, we believed it was an 
opportune time for a full systematic review and 
quantitative analysis of elder abuse prevalence.
To address the need for more accurate global and 
regional estimates of elder abuse prevalence, we did a 
systematic review and meta-analysis of existing elder 
abuse prevalence studies from around the world. We 
aimed to understand the wide variations in prevalence 
estimates by investigating the infl
 uence of studies’ 
demographic and methodological characteristics.
Methods
Search strategy and selection criteria
In this systematic review and meta-analysis, we used a 
comprehensive four-step search strategy to identify 
relevant studies. No language restrictions were placed on 
the searches or search results. The study conforms to the 
Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic reviews 
and Meta-Analysis (PRISMA) guidelines. A detailed

description of the method has been previously reported 
and is available upon request.12 The research is part of a 
larger systematic review; however, the present study 
focused on self-reported prevalence studies on elder 
abuse 
within 
community 
settings. 
Forthcoming 
publications will focus on prevalence of abuse in 
institutional settings as well as studies using service-
based data.
First, we searched the following 14 academic databases 
from inception to June 26, 2015: PubMed, PsycINFO, 
CINAHL, EMBASE, MEDLINE, Sociological Abstracts, 
ERIC, AgeLine, Social Work Abstracts, International 
Bibliography of the Social Sciences, Social Services 
Abstracts, 
ProQuest 
Criminal 
Justice, 
ASSIA, 
Dissertations & Theses Full Text, and Dissertations & 
Theses Global. A search strategy was developed for each 
database with a combination of free text and controlled 
vocabulary (ie, MeSH terms). Additional search terms 
were included in consultation with an information 
specialist (librarian) who has extensive experience in 
systematic reviews. Some of the search terms include: 
“older adults”, “frail elderly”, “aged”, “elderly”, “seniors”, 
“elder abuse”, “elder neglect”, “elder mistreatment”, 
“elder maltreatment”, “domestic violence”, “intimate 
partner violence”, “abuse”, “violence”, “aggression”, 
“crimes”, 
“harmful 
behaviour”, 
“anger”, 
“rape”, 
“hostility”, “confl
 ict”, “verbal abuse”, “physical abuse”, 
“sexual 
abuse”, 
“emotional 
abuse”, 
“prevalence”, 
“incidence”, “morbidity”, and “epidemiology”. See 
appendix for the full search strategy.
Second, reference lists of publications retrieved in the 
fi
 rst step were screened for relevant studies. Third, we 
searched additional web-based platforms including 
specialised journals, Google searches for grey literature, 
and WHO Global Health Library for scientifi
 c literature 
published in developing countries. Finally, after all the 
screening and reviewing of studies had been completed, 
we consulted 26 experts in the fi
 eld by email, representing 
each of the six WHO regions (ie, African, Americas, 
South-East Asia, Europen, Eastern Mediterranean, and 
Western Pacifi
 c) to provide further review to identify any 
studies that were missing up to Dec 18, 2015.
Articles were independently screened in two stages: 
screening of titles and abstracts followed by the retrieval 
and screening of full-text articles by two reviewers using

Research in context
Evidence before this study
We did a thorough search of the scientifi
 c literature before 
initiating this study to detect any existing systematic reviews 
or prevalence studies; furthermore, we used the systematic 
review done for this study, as detailed above, to ensure that 
no studies had been missed. Although no meta-analyses 
existed before this study, one systematic review emerged in 
the scientifi
 c literature after the initiation of this study that 
found a global aggregate elder abuse prevalence rate of 
14·3% (95% CI 7·6–21·1).
Added value of this study
Our study is the fi
 rst of its kind to use meta-analysis to quantify 
prevalence estimates derived from a comprehensive search 
strategy that included additional search for studies that are not 
commonly found in academic sources.
Implications of all the available evidence
The dearth of elder abuse prevalence studies from low-income 
and middle-income countries and from southeast Asia and 
Africa, despite our comprehensive search strategy, suggests a 
need for further research to better understand elder abuse in 
these areas of the world. However, high rates of abuse globally 
suggest that increased attention to the issue of elder abuse is 
warranted, including investment in development and 
assessment of elder abuse interventions to help reduce the 
spread and eff
 ect of elder abuse. 
Panel 1: Risk of Bias Tool: criteria for assessment of quality
External validity (maximum score=4)
1 Was the study’s target population a close representation 
of the national population (subnational or city) in relation 
to relevant variables such as age, sex, occupation? 
(Yes: low risk=1 point; no: high risk=0 points)
2 Was the sampling frame a true or close representation of 
the target population? (Yes: low risk=1 point; 
no: high risk=0 points)
3 Was some form of random selection used to select the 
sample, or was a census undertaken? 
(Yes: low risk=1 point; no: high risk=0 points)
4 Was the likelihood of non-response bias minimal? 
(Yes: low risk=1 point; no: high risk=0 points)
Internal validity (maximum score=6)
1 Were data collected directly from the subjects (as opposed 
to a proxy)? (Yes: low risk=1 point; no: high risk=0 points)
2 Was an acceptable case defi
 nition used in the study? 
(Yes: low risk=1 point; no: high risk=0 points)
3 Was the study instrument that measured the parameter of 
interest shown to have reliability and validity (if necessary)? 
(Yes: low risk=1 point; no: high risk=0 points)
4 Was the same mode of data collection used for all 
subjects? (Yes: low risk=1 point; no: high risk=0 points)
5 Was the length of the shortest prevalence period for the 
parameter of interest appropriate? (Yes: low risk=1 point; 
no: high risk=0 points)
6 Were the numerator(s) and denominator(s) for the 
parameter of interest appropriate? (Yes: low risk=1 point; 
no: high risk=0 points)

the eligibility criteria described below. If several 
publications reported on a single study, the publication 
that provided the most data was selected for further 
synthesis. Inter-rater reliability was analysed using the 
Statistical Package for Social Sciences (SPPS Statistics 21). 
This analysis showed high levels of agreement between 
the reviews (κ 0·86–0·96). Disagreements were resolved 
through discussion, or with the help of a third reviewer.
Inclusion criteria were community-based samples that 
provided estimates of abuse prevalence at a national or 
subnational level (eg, states or provinces, counties, 
districts, and large cities [except in the USA, where states 
are the smallest unit, due to a large number of prevalence 
studies]) and inclusion of participants that were aged 
60 years and older, in line with the UN defi
 nition of older 
people.13 We excluded studies that were reviews, 
conference proceedings, or used qualitative methods 
only; studies that focused exclusively on self-neglect or 
homicide; and studies that concentrated only on 
institutional abuse or on specifi
 c subpopulations.
Data extraction and quality assessment
Data were extracted by two reviewers (YY, CRM): YY 
extracted data from the publications and CRM cross-
checked for accuracy. Three main categories of data were 
extracted: characteristics of the samples, methodological 
characteristics of each study, and prevalence estimates of 
elder abuse and its subtypes. The data extraction tables 
were pilot tested and refi
 ned before extraction. The study 
quality was assessed as part of the data extraction strategy 
by two reviewers with the standardised Risk of Bias Tool 
(panel 1)14 designed to assess population-based prevalence 
studies. To assess the risk of bias, reviewers rated each of 
the ten items into dichotomous ratings: low risk and high 
risk. An overall score was calculated by adding all the items 
rated as low risk. Thus, higher scores indicated lower risk 
of bias and stronger method quality.
Data analysis
Meta-analysis was done to synthesise the prevalence 
estimate for elder abuse and its subtypes. The decision to 
do a meta-analysis was made a posteriori to ensure that 
suffi
  cient studies with similar characteristics (eg, same 
prevalence period population) were available for meta-
analysis. Prevalence rates were calculated from raw 
proportions or percentages reported in the selected studies. 
The investigators were contacted for those studies in which 
raw data were missing or unclear. All analyses were done 
using Comprehensive Meta-Analysis software (CMA 
version 3.9).15 Variances of raw proportions or percentages 
were pooled based on a random-eff
 ects model. 
16 We 
calculated the pooled estimates and the 95% CIs in studies 
and considered non-overlapping CIs as an indication of 
statistically signifi
 cant diff
 erences. To determine the extent 
of variation between the studies, we did heterogeneity tests 
with Higgins’ I² statistic to measure the proportion of the 
observed variance that refl
 ects true eff
 ect sizes.16
We followed Duval and Tweedie’s Trim and Fill 
method to visually inspect the funnel plots and assess 
both the degree of publication bias and its eff
 ect on the 
study fi
 ndings.16,17 We used their method of removing 
extreme outliers (ie, small studies) from the funnel plot 
and re-computing the eff
 ect size to correct for 
publication bias.17
Subgroup analyses were done to investigate the sources 
of heterogeneity, using bivariate comparisons and meta-

regression. These analyses tested individual associations 
between the pooled estimates and several covariates: 
WHO regions (recoded as Americas, Asia, Europe, and 
others); income classifi
 cation of each country (according 
to the World Bank classifi
 cation, recoded into high vs 
middle-income and low-income countries); method of 
data collection (face-to-face vs all others); sampling 
procedure (random vs convenience sampling); research 
quality (recorded as good vs fair-to-poor); and sample size 
(coded as high, medium, and low tertiles, using the 33rd 
and 67th percentile scores). Signifi
 cant and relevant 
covariates were entered into a multivariate meta-
regression model. This study is registered with

Results
Of the 38 544 studies, 415 potentially relevant full-text 
articles were independently reviewed. From these, we 
identifi
 ed 234 studies that provided data on abuse 
prevalence. Among these, seven studies examined elder 
abuse prevalence in people with dementia, 14 provided 
prevalence data for any abuse that had occurred since the 
victims became older adults (ie, aged 60 or 65 years and 
older), ten focused on subpopulations (eg, older women 
and ethnic minorities), 32 were incidence-based and 
service-based, 84 did not report the prevalence period or 
provided prevalence periods ranging from the past 
month to the past 5 years, and 35 were duplicates in that 
they used the same datasets as other studies (fi
 gure 1). To 
avoid bias in data synthesis, we grouped studies with the 
same prevalence period for meta-analysis. After 
excluding ineligible studies, 52 studies provided past-
year prevalence data for abuse and were thus included in 
the meta-analysis. Panel 2 summarises the key outcome 
measures based on the defi
 nitions provided by WHO1 
and the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. 
18
The 52 studies selected for meta-analysis were 
geographically diverse and included 28 countries, with 
fi
 ve studies from the WHO region of the western Pacifi
 c, 
fi
 ve from the southeast Asia region, 15 from the region of 
the Americas, 25 from the European region, and two 
from the eastern Mediterranean region. Studies also 
came from countries across the World Bank income 
classifi
 cation: fi
 ve studies from lower-middle-income 
countries, 13 from upper-middle-income countries, and 
34 from high-income countries. Moreover, 40 studies 
were based on random samples and the remaining 
12 were convenience samples. Most studies (38) used 
face-to-face interviews to collect data, eight studies used 
self-administered questionnaires, and six used telephone 
interviews. The quality of each study was assessed. A 
maximum quality score of 10 was achieved in 16 of the 
52 studies; 35 studies were scored as good quality and 
17 studies were scored as fair-to-poor (table 1).
Prevalence rates for overall elder abuse were reported 
in 44 studies that included of 59 203 individuals. Overall 
elder abuse consisted of any combination of abuse 
subtypes as reported in the studies. The combined 
prevalence for overall abuse in the past year was 
15·7% (95% CI 12·8–19·3; fi
 gure 2). Visual inspection 
of the funnel plot showed no evidence of publication 
bias (data not shown). The set of studies was 
heterogeneous for overall abuse (Q[43]=4532·02, 
p<0·0001), suggesting diff
 erences in the eff
 ect sizes 
exist within this set of studies. Higgins’ I² showed that 
99% of the variance comes from a source other than 
sampling error. The sources of the variation were 
investigated with bivariate analyses. Sample size was 
signifi
 cantly associated with elder abuse prevalence (ie, 
high, medium, and low; Q[2]=18·96, p<0·0001). Two 
further covariates had p values below 0·10: income

• 
Overall abuse (44 studies, 59 203 participants): “a single, 
or repeated act, or lack of appropriate action, occurring 
within any relationship where there is an expectation of 
trust which causes harm or distress to an older person”.1 
Overall abuse might consist of any combination of abuse 
subtypes defi
 ned by the US Centers for Disease Control 
and Prevention,18 below:
• 
Physical abuse (46 studies, 64 946 participants): when an 
older person is injured as a result of hitting, kicking, 
pushing, slapping, burning, or other show of force
• 
Sexual abuse (15 studies, 43 332 participants): 
involves forcing an older person to take part in a sexual 
act when the elder does not or cannot consent
• 
Psychological or emotional abuse (44 studies, 
60 192 participants): behaviours that harm an older 
person’s self-worth or wellbeing. Examples include name 
calling, scaring, embarrassing, destroying property, or not 
letting the elder see friends and family
• 
Financial abuse (40 studies, 45 915 participants): 
illegally misusing an older person’s money, property, or 
assets
• 
Neglect (28 studies, 39 515 participants): failure to meet 
an older person’s basic needs. These needs include food, 
housing, clothing, and medical care

low-income; Q[1]=3·66, p=0·0558) and method of data 
collection (ie, random sampling and convenience 
sampling; Q[1]=3·10, p=0·0784).
Sample size, income classifi
 cation, and method of data 
collection were entered into the meta-regression, which 
yielded a signifi
 cant model (F[4]=3·34, p=0·0191) that 
explained 26% of the variance. We found that when 
compared with studies with high sample size, studies 
with medium and low sample sizes had signifi
 cantly 
higher prevalence estimates (7·2% vs 18·2%; T[36]=2·70, 
p=0·0101) and 18·1% (T[36]=2·51, p=0·0164). Studies 
using random sampling and those done in high-income 
countries had lower prevalence estimates in the meta-
regression model, although diff
 erences for these 
variables were not independently statistically signifi
 cant.
Of the 44 studies that reported overall abuse, 32 provided 
gender breakdown, with women representing 19 756 of 
34 886 individuals. There was no gender diff
 erence in 
prevalence estimates (Q[1]=3·07, p=0·0799). Additional 
analyses were done to examine bivariate gender diff
 erences 
within several subgroups, revealing no signifi
 cant 
diff
 erences. The global and WHO regional prevalence 
estimates for abuse in women and men are shown in 
fi
 gure 3.
Pooled prevalence estimates were determined for each 
of the abuse subtypes, with trim and fi
 ll adjustments done 
to account for missing studies because of publication bias. 
After adjustment, the prevalence estimate was 11·6% 
(95% CI 8·1–16·3) for psychological abuse, 6·8% 
(5·0–9·2) for fi
 nancial abuse, 4·2% (2·1–8·1) for neglect, 
2·6% (1·6–4·4) for physical abuse, and 0·9% (0·6–1·4) for 
sexual abuse (table 2).
Discussion
Using meta-analytical methods, we pooled the prevalence 
estimates of elder abuse reported in 52 publications 
published between 2002 and 2015. The global prevalence 
of elder abuse was 15·7%, or about one in six older 
adults. Given the approximate 2015 population estimates 
of 901 million people aged 60 years and older, 
53 this rate 
amounts to 141 million victims of elder abuse annually. 
Prevalence estimates for abuse subtypes were highest for 
psychological abuse, followed by fi
 nancial abuse, neglect, 
physical abuse, and sexual abuse. There was signifi
 cant 
heterogeneity in the studies; 26% of the variance could 
be explained by sample size, income classifi
 cation, and 
method of data collection. We found that studies with 
smaller sample sizes have higher prevalence estimates.
Few systematic reviews on the global prevalence of elder 
abuse exist, and none have used meta-analysis to synthesise 
global prevalence estimates. For the fi
 rst time, this study 
provides methodologically rigorous global and regional 
estimates of elder abuse. Almost one in six older adults 
experienced abuse in the past year. This estimate is similar 
to the estimate from a recent systematic review by Pillemer 
and colleagues, 
54 which found a global aggregate of 14·3% 
(95% CI 7·6–21·1). This fi
 gure was calculated based on 
18 well conducted and large-scale population studies from 
20 countries: 17 from high-income countries, two from 
upper-middle-income countries, and one from a lower-
middle-income country. Our estimate of 15·7% was 
calculated based on 44 studies that came from a broad 
range of research quality and sample sizes. The convergence 
between these two global estimates, from two independently 
conducted systematic reviews, lends them credibility.

The present study also reveals considerable regional 
variations. Dong did a small-scale systematic review of 
prevalence studies and grouped estimates by continents,11 
including Asia with a range from 14% in India23 to 36·2% 
in China,30 Europe with a range from 2·2% in Ireland39 to 
61·1% in Croatia,28 and the Americas with a range from 
10% in the USA52 to 79·7% in Peru.45 Like Dong,11 our 
fi
 ndings provided insights into geographical diff
 erences 
in prevalence estimates, with Asia at 20·2%, Europe at 
15·4%, and the Americas at 11·7%.
There are few analyses of how studies’ characteristics 
infl
 uence abuse prevalence, and none in the area of elder 
abuse. Meta-analytical research on childhood sexual 
abuse suggested that studies using random sampling, 
compared with convenience sampling, as well as those 
with larger sample sizes, rather than smaller ones, were 
more likely to produce lower prevalence estimates.55,56 
The present study’s meta-regression found that these 
two variables and income classifi
 cation explained 26% of 
the variance in elder abuse prevalence. Large sample 
sizes, random sampling, and high-income countries 
were associated with lower prevalence estimates, 
although only sample size diff
 erences were independently 
statistically signifi
 cant. As such, the methodological 
characteristics of this sample had eff
 ects in similar 
directions to those seen in published work on childhood 
sexual abuse.
Despite several additional analyses, our research found 
no signifi
 cant diff
 erence in prevalence between older 
women and older men. Few studies have examined 
gender diff
 erences in elder abuse; those that did found 
mixed results, with some identifying disparate rates 
across genders.57 Yet in studies of intimate partner 
violence, gender symmetry is reported, supported by 
both systematic review58 and meta-analysis.59 Although 
much research on abuse has used gender roles and 
masculinity as a predictor for violent behaviour, emerging 
evidence has shown a weak association between gender 
roles and abuse. 
60 This evidence is further supported by 
similar rates of intimate partner violence emerging 
among same-sex and heterosexual couples.60 However, 
most of this scientifi
 c literature comes from high-income 
countries and if more studies from low-income and 
middle-income countries were available, the fi
 nding of 
gender symmetry might not hold. Nonetheless, our 
fi
 ndings contribute to this growing evidence for gender 
symmetry in abuse victimisation.
There are many strengths in this systematic review and 
meta-analysis. Our study is the fi
 rst of its kind to use meta-
analysis to quantify prevalence estimates derived from a 
comprehensive search strategy that included additional 
searches for studies that are not commonly found in 
academic sources. We also communicated with 26 experts 
to identify relevant articles. This study is also the fi
 rst to 
include non-English language articles in a systematic 
review. We have extracted data from 47 non-English 
articles; the ten included in the analysis were written in 
Spanish, Portuguese, Chinese, German, and Farsi. Our 
study is the only study on elder abuse to explore the 
sources of heterogeneity. The wide confi
 dence intervals 
found in our study as well as Pillemer and colleagues’ 
study54 show the importance of further research in this 
area to identify further sources of this large variance.
Our 
model 
(which 
included 
country 
income 
classifi
 cation, whether the study used a random or 
convenience sample, and the size of the sample) left 74% 
of the variance unaccounted for. Factors that might 
explain this large proportion of variance, particularly 
between WHO regional estimates, might include 
country-specifi
 c or culture-specifi
 c social norms that 
govern 
family 
dynamics 
and 
expectations 
and 
methodological characteristics that we were unable to 
include. These methodological factors might include

varying defi
 nitions of elder abuse as well as the use of 
standardised or non-standardised instruments to assess 
and measure abuse.
Despite the strengths of our study, there are several 
limitations that can be addressed with future research. 
Although our comprehensive search strategy has 
identifi
 ed many relevant studies, the majority of the 
studies included in the meta-analysis were from high-
income countries. Prevalence studies are sparse or 
absent for many regions of the world, particularly in 
southeast Asia and Africa, which seem to have higher 
rates of abuse than developed countries.11,31,61 More 
prevalence studies in low-income and middle-income 
countries are needed, particularly within these regions. 
These prevalence studies should use similar methods to 
allow for comparisons across countries.
Although many attempts have been made to contact the 
authors of selected studies, crucial data on defi
 nitions and 
measurements were still missing. This information is 
important for further methodological analyses that could 
examine how diff
 erent defi
 nitions, measurements, and 
study periods aff
 ect prevalence estimates. For instance, 
although our fi
 ndings are consistent with existing studies 
showing higher prevalence for psychological and fi
 nancial 
abuse compared with other subtypes, there are challenges 
in defi
 ning and measuring psychological and fi
 nancial 
abuse. Moreover, although our systematic review 
identifi
 ed 234 studies on prevalence, the meta-analysis 
only focused on abuse occurring in the past year. It is 
possible that death of a victim can aff
 ect past-year 
prevalence; future research could compare and examine 
abuse estimates by using diff
 erent study periods (eg, past 
month or lifetime), focusing on national or subnational 
studies, or examining prevalence variations within each 
WHO region. Additional research could explore the eff
 ect 
of country-specifi
 c or culture-specifi
 c social norms on 
prevalence estimates by including additional normative 
variables (eg, fi
 lial piety and existence of elder caregiving 
policies). The present study, focusing on older adults in 
general, found lower prevalence estimates than did 
studies that examined abuse in people in other age groups 
with disabilities.62,63 Future research might also benefi
 t 
from examining elder abuse prevalence in older adults 
with physical and cognitive disabilities, particularly given 
the widespread cognitive declines often seen in the oldest 
elders. Research in these areas would provide the basis to 
developing eff
 ective strategies to prevent and respond to 
abuse.
Elder abuse, despite aff
 ecting almost one in six (more 
than 140 million) older people, has not achieved the same 
public health priority as other forms of violence. None of 
the 169 targets of the UN’s recently adopted 17 Sustainable 
Development Goals explicitly addresses violence against 
older people. By contrast, target 5.2 aims to eliminate all 
forms of violence against women and target 16.2 aims to 
end violence against children.64 If the proportion of elder 
abuse victims remains constant, the number of victims 
will increase rapidly due to population ageing,53 growing

to 330 million victims by 2050. The fi
 ndings of this study 
strengthen the case for global action to expand eff
 orts for 
preventing and supporting victims of abuse. Considering 
the serious health consequences, the health sector has an 
important role to prevent, raise awareness of, and provide 
evidence-based guidance for health-care practitioners to 
respond to elder abuse, particularly on psychological and 
fi
 nancial abuse, which are more prevalent. Yet, few 
evidence-based 
interventions 
exist 
at 
present.65–67 
Investment in developing and assessing elder abuse 
interventions must be a public health priority to help to 
reduce the eff
 ect of elder abuse worldwide.
