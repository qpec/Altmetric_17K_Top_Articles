Abstract
It has been demonstrated that, on their own, both exercise and stimulation from the environ-
ment can improve cognitive function and well-being in older adults. The combined effect of
exercising in the outdoor environment on psychological function is less well studied. The
aim of the current study was to investigate the effect of an outdoor cycling intervention on
cognitive function and mental health and well-being in older adults. A total of 100 older
adults took part in the study (aged 50–83), 26 of which were non-cycling controls, 36 were
conventional pedal cyclists and 38 were participants using an e-bike (a bike fitted with an
electric motor to provide assistance with pedaling), as part of a larger project (www.
cycleboom.org). Participants took part in the study for an eight-week period, with cycling
participants required to cycle at least three times a week for thirty minutes in duration for
each cycle ride. Cognitive function and well-being were measured before and after the inter-
vention period. For executive function, namely inhibition (the Stroop task) and updating (Let-
ter Updating Task), both cycling groups improved in accuracy after the intervention
compared to non-cycling control participants. E-bike participants also improved in process-
ing speed (reaction times in go trials of the Stop-It task) after the intervention compared to
non-cycling control participants. Finally, e-bike participants improved in their mental health
score after the intervention compared to non-cycling controls as measured by the SF-36.
This suggests that there may be an impact of exercising in the environment on executive
function and mental health. Importantly, we showed a similar (sometimes larger) effect for
the e-bike group compared to the pedal cyclists. This suggests that it is not just the physical
activity component of cycling that is having an influence. Both pedal cycles and e-bikes can
enable increased physical activity and engagement with the outdoor environment with e-
bikes potentially providing greater benefits.

 Introduction
Healthy ageing has been defined as the process of developing and maintaining functional abil-
ity, the ability to perform tasks of daily living, that enables well-being in older age [1]. Success-
ful ageing [2] is the conception that ageing is not necessarily accompanied by decline in
cognitive function and reduction in brain matter. Although a number of these processes show
the greatest rate of decline in late adulthood, they have been demonstrated to be highly mallea-
ble, even in older age [3].
Recent intervention studies have demonstrated that cognitive function and brain integrity
can be maintained, or even improved, through increasing the frequency and duration of mod-
erate to vigorous exercise (e.g., [3, 4, 5]) even over a short period of time (e.g., six weeks in a
younger population; [6]). Exercise can also reduce the occurrence of age-associated neurode-
generative disorders, such as Alzheimer’s disease and vascular dementia [7, 8, 9]. Studies focus-
ing on the effect of exercise in late adulthood have shown improvements in cognitive function.
Colcombe and Kramer (2003) [10] reported that exercise broadly improves cognitive function
in older adults across a number of domains with medium to large effect sizes. These include
executive function (tasks such as coordination, inhibition, planning, and working memory
[11]), controlled abilities (tasks that require controlled, effortful processing which can become
automatic with consistent practice), speed (e.g., simple reaction time or finger tapping) and
spatial functioning (e.g., spatial reasoning), with the strongest effect size observed for executive
function. Executive function-related processes and the brain areas that support them have
been shown to be disproportionately sensitive to ageing [12]. These, however, appear to be the
most amenable to exercise interventions relative to other cognitive functions, particularly aero-
bic exercise [13].
Exercise improving cognitive function is possibly related to increasing cerebral vascular
blood flow [14] enabling increase in volume and cell regeneration in regions of the brain that
are critical for efficient cognitive functioning (e.g., the hippocampus [5, 6]). Thomas and col-
leagues [6] found increases in anterior hippocampal volume in sedentary, young to middle-
aged (average age 34) adults after a 6-week exercise (30 minutes of cycling on an exercise bike,
5 days a week) intervention [6]. Therefore, exercise, specifically aerobic exercise on a bicycle,
may improve cognitive function through vascular brain changes.
In addition to direct effects on cognitive function, exercise can protect cognitive perfor-
mance against the adverse effects of lower well-being [15] as evidence suggests that exercise
increases subjective, or psychological, well-being [16]. It has been found that exercise improves
self-efficacy and well-being improvement overall [8]. Furthermore, significant associations
have been found between self-rated meaningfulness of life and regular and intensive physical
exercise [17]. The large effect of physical activity on view of self and global well-being are
explained by change in self-efficacy and belief in ability to achieve requisite actions in order to
satisfy situational demands. This was found to be the most salient variable affecting well-being
and psychological health. If psychological well-being is increased through exercise it may also
aid cognitive function in older adults as cognition has been shown to be associated with varia-
tion in mean levels of well-being in older adults and lower levels of depression [15].
Cognitive function and well-being have also been shown to increase from simply being out-
side in the environment (e.g., [18, 19]). This could be related to the outdoor environment hav-
ing the potential to promote attention restoration, stress reduction, and the evocation of
positive emotions [18]. Exercising outside in the environment, for example cycling, as opposed
to indoor exercise (e.g. in a gym setting) could, therefore, further augment the already demon-
strated benefits of physical activity for cognitive function and well-being. However, very few
studies have investigated the impact of exercising in the outdoor environment. For those

 studies that have been conducted, it has been found that green exercise can led to a significant
improvement in self-esteem, positive mood and general increase in well-being [18, 19, 20]. In
addition to effects of aerobic exercise on cognitive function, particularly executive function,
outdoor exercise such as cycling, requires navigation in the environment, enabling changes in
brain regions supporting spatial encoding [5, 6, 21].
Given the associations between cognitive function, well-being and exercise in older adults,
the aim of the study reported in this paper was to investigate the effect of cycling outdoors on
cognitive function and mental health and well-being of older adults (over 50 years old). Com-
pared to other studies, which measure effect of indoor exercise (e.g., [3, 5, 6, 13, 14]), we
wanted to investigate cycling as a form of aerobic exercise in its natural environment, i.e. out-
doors. We expected aerobic exercise to be an additional benefit to cognition and well-being on
top of the effect of being outdoors. In particular, we were interested in whether there was a dif-
ference in performance between users of assistive technology in the form of electric bikes (‘e-
bikes’) to cycle outdoors in the environment and regular pedal cycle users, with pedal cycling
requiring more aerobic exertion than e-bikes.
Based on prior work on cognitive benefits of exercise (as reviewed above), we predicted that
in particular executive function (i.e., inhibition, updating, task switching, and working mem-
ory processes) would be improved by increased exercise during the eight-week intervention.
Such an effect would be demonstrated by improved post intervention scores compared to
baseline (pre intervention), with this improvement being greatest in the pedal than e-bike
cyclists (due to the additional physical exertion required) and compared to non-cycling con-
trols. We also expected to find an increase in spatial reasoning tasks, and in positive mood and
well-being after the interventions.
Method
Participants and study design
In this study we recruited non-cyclist older adults (over the age of 50) to take part in a cycling
intervention, measuring cognitive performance, mental health and well-being before and after
the intervention. This study was part of a wider ‘cycleBOOM’ project (www.cycleboom.org)
that aimed to develop a better understanding of how the design of the built environment and
technology shaped engagement with, and experience of, cycling as people get older, and how
this affected their independent mobility, health and well-being. Older adults were asked to
cycle for an eight-week period. This intervention length has been successful in improving cog-
nitive and brain function in prior work (e.g., [6, 10]).
We tested a total of 100 older adults (this was based on a medium effect size, as reported in
the studies included in Colcombe and Kramer’s, 2003, meta-analysis [10], for mixed ANOVA
with interactions: effect size = .04 power = .80, alpha = .05, minimum total sample size = 111),
26 of which were non-cycling controls, 36 were pedal cyclists and 38 were e-bike participants
(see Table 1 for demographic information for the three groups). We recruited older adults
(over the age of 50) who reported that they had either done no cycling in the past five years, or
that their cycling had seriously diminished over that period. Participants first undertook a
cycle training assessment/skills development program with an accredited trainer. The timing
between the training and the baseline assessment was typically a week and in no case no longer
than a month before the trial started. The non-cycling controls were included to measure prac-
tice effects, and to assess whether the intervention effect was greater than this, and did not
undertake the cycle training. Participants were pseudo-randomly assigned to one of three
groups: pedal cycling, e-bike or non-cycling control groups. Priority was given to filling the
cycling spots then controls were recruited to match sample characteristics (age and sex; see

 demographic information in Table 1) as well as trial season. The control group were recruited
after the experimental groups had started to be run so that we could match age and gender in
the control group with those participants in the experimental groups. The control group were
aware that they would not be cycling during the trial and those in the experimental group were
all re-engaging with cycling. Cycling was completed in the Reading and Oxford areas.
Informed written consent was obtained from all subjects in accordance with the Declaration of
Helsinki and ethical approval was obtained from the University of Reading’s Research Ethics
Committee (Registration No: 14/31) and the research complied with the ethical requirements
of Oxford Brookes University (Registration No: 140813).
Prior to commencing the trail participants completed a battery of cognitive tasks and well-
being questionnaires (see descriptions below) as well as providing demographic information
including their age, gender, and how many years they had spent in education. Demographic
information was obtained prior to the trial starting and the experimenter was unblinded to
group allocation. The cognitive testing battery employed included tasks assessing executive
function, spatial reasoning and memory. The instructions for the tasks were standardised, read
from a script and presented on the screen for the participant to also read for all the computer-
ised tasks. The pedal and e-bike cyclists were asked to cycle at least three times a week for thirty
minutes in duration for each cycle ride for an eight-week period. Pedal cyclists could either
use their own cycle for the trial or they were loaned one by the study. All e-bike participants
were provided with the same Raleigh (Motus) e-bike to complete the trial. E-bike participants
cycled in the outdoor environment like their pedal cycling counterparts but had electrical
assistance from a motor on the pedal bike (a choice of five settings; ’off’, ’eco’, ’tour’, ’sport’,
’turbo’, each increasing the amount of electrical assistance the participant gained from the
motor on the e-bike). All participants were asked to maintain their normal level of physical
activity during this period and control participants were asked not to participate in any out-
door or indoor cycling activity. All participants completed daily diaries during the intervention
documenting the type and duration of exercise they conducted. All participants came back to
complete the cognitive tests and well-being questionnaires again after they completed the
intervention, eight weeks later. The assessment was done no sooner than one week before the
start of the trial and no longer than one week after the end of the trial. An online exit survey
(via google docs) containing 12 questions about their cycling behavior since completing the
trial was also conducted several months after their trial had finished, gauging the extent to
which participants were still engaged in cycling. This survey was completed by 73 participants.

The following tests were administered before and after the eight-week period. These tasks were
presented in a counterbalanced order across participants.

 Executive function tasks
Verbal fluency. This task measures executive function, specifically updating [22]. The ver-
bal fluency task was split into two parts, the letter verbal fluency (where participants are
required to say as many words beginning with the letter ‘F’ in one minute) and the category
verbal fluency (where participants are required to say as many different animals in one min-
ute). Responses were recorded and written down by the experimenter. The score reflects the
number of words that the participant stated within the allocated time.
Plus-minus task. This measures task switching [23]. The plus-minus task is a pen-and-
paper task. Participants had to add three to a series of numbers (30 numbers on each page) on
the first page, subtract three from each number on the second page and then alternate between
adding three and subtracting three on the last page. Time taken to complete each section and
accuracy was recorded for this. The interference from completing the switching task was calcu-
lated by deducting the average of the first two sections.
Letter updating task.
This task measures working memory and updating [23, 24]. The
participant was required to remember a sequence of letters. Letters were presented serially on
the screen for 2000 ms with a 150 ms blank screen in between letter presentation. The
sequence ranged from four to nine letters in length. The participant was required, for each let-
ter that appeared on the screen, to state the previous two letters (that are no longer present on
the screen) and the one that was currently on the screen in the order that they appeared. When
the sequence was complete, the participant heard a beep and had to repeat, again, the last three
letters they saw. The participant had two practice trials before the experimental trials com-
menced. The total score correct was the number of trials the participant got the last three let-
ters correct of the twelve trials presented.
Stroop task. This task measures inhibition [23, 25]. Words are presented on the screen
one at a time. The words are colour words ‘green’, ‘blue’, ‘red’, ‘yellow’ that are printed in these
different coloured inks. The participant is required to press a key with the colour indicated on
for the ink colour, inhibiting the written word presented. Each word was displayed for 1300
ms with a 350 ms blank screen in between word presentation. There were 36 practice trials (22
congruent trials {written word and ink colour the same}, 14 incongruent trials {written word
and ink colour different}) and 72 experimental trials (36 congruent, 36 incongruent). The
interference from reporting the ink colour and not the written word was calculated by sub-
tracting the average incongruent accuracy from that of the congruent trials.
Stop-it task. This task measures inhibition and was designed by Verbruggen, Logan, and
Stevens (2008) [26]. It is a version of a stop signal task. A square or a circle is displayed on the
screen for 1250 ms. Participants were instructed to respond as quickly as possible to the iden-
tity of the stimulus (1.6 cm × 1.6 cm) by pressing the \ (square) or / (circle) keys, which
depicted that object on them as a memory aid. On 25% of trials (stop trials), participants heard
a tone through the speaker of the laptop that indicated that they should withhold their
response on that trial. The tone was initially presented 250 ms after the visual stimulus
appeared, and was adjusted using a tracking procedure by which the latency increased by 50
ms following a successfully withheld response, and decreased by 50 ms following a failure to
withhold a response. Participants completed 600 trials in total (75% go). The primary measures
are Stop-Signal Reaction Time (SSRT) and go RT.
Eriksen flanker task. This task measures inhibition and is an arrow version of the original
Eriksen flanker task [27]. During this task participants are presented with a series of five
arrows presented in a row on the screen at the same time, each pointing left or right. A set of
five arrows was displayed for a duration ranging between 1100 and 1500 ms with no blank
screen in between sets of arrows. A central fixation cross was displayed for 2000 ms before the

 first set of arrows appeared. Participants had to respond as quickly as possible the direction of
the middle arrow (right or left, using corresponding arrows on the keyboard), ignoring the
external arrows. There were 100 trials in total, with no practice session. On 50 trials, all the
arrows pointed in the same direction as the middle arrow (congruent trials). On 50 of trials,
the external arrows pointed in a different direction to the middle arrow (incongruent). The
interference from reporting the direction of the middle arrow and not the external arrows was
calculated by subtracting the average incongruent accuracy from that of the congruent trials.
Memory tasks
Consortium to Establish a Registry for Alzheimer’s Disease (CERAD) immediate and
delayed recall.
The CERAD [28] task measures immediate and delayed memory recall. The
immediate task required the participant to recall as many of the ten words they have just
heard. There are three trials of the same words in different orders. The delayed test was com-
pleted after the plus-minus task, where participants had free-recall and a recognition test (10
of 20 words presented were in the original list). The immediate recall was scored out of 30 (3
lists of 10 words), as was the delayed recall (10 for free recall and 20 for the recognition test).
MMSE.
The MMSE [29] measures memory and orientation, with questions such as "what
is today’s date?" and was scored out of 30.
Spatial function tasks
Mazes and mental rotation task.
These tasks were designed in house by the authors and
the mental rotation tasks were similar to stimuli employed to assess this ability in other studies
[30,31,32]. These stimuli are included in S1 Fig. Five mazes were completed, varying in diffi-
culty. The participant had to find the route from the ’start’ indicated on the maze to the ’end’
as quickly as possible. They were timed during completion and number of errors (deviation
from the correct route) were scored. The mental rotation task contained five 3-D mental rota-
tion trials, whereby the participant had to match the shape from three options (two incorrect),
which only differed in orientation, to the original. There were also five 2-D trials.
Well-being, physical activity and health questionnaires
Psychological Well-Being (PWB) questionnaire.
Developed by Ryff (1995) [33] this
questionnaire measured 6 dimensions of well-being: autonomy, environmental mastery, per-
sonal growth, positive relations with others, purpose in life, and self-acceptance. The 84-items
are presented on a 6-point Likert scale (1 = strongly disagree, 6 = strongly agree), with reverse
coding on some items and a high score reflecting higher well-being (Cronbach’s α pre/
post = 0.95/0.95).
Satisfaction in Life (SL). Measuring life satisfaction, participants stated how much they
agreed with five statements on beliefs of the conditions of their life [34]. A 7-point Likert scale,
with 1 = strongly disagree and 7 = strongly agree (Cronbach’s α pre/post = 0.90/0.86).
Positive and Negative Affect Scale (PANAS)—general.
This measure, developed by
Watson, Clark and Tellegen (1988) [35], included 20 adjectives which participants had to rate
on the extent they felt these adjectives generally (e.g., over the last week) on a five-point Likert
scale (1 = very slightly or not at all, 5 = extremely). There are 10 positive adjectives (e.g., proud,
interested, excited) and 10 negative adjectives (e.g., distressed, upset, guilty). The positive and
negative scores are summed separately (Cronbach’s α positive PANAS pre/post = 0.85/0.81,
negative PANAS pre/post = 0.89/0.88).
Health survey short form (SF-36).
This is a short questionnaire designed to measure
physical and mental health [36]. A high score reflects greater health and there are mental and
Cycling, cognitive function and well-being in older adults

 physical health sub-scales (Cronbach’s α mental health pre/post = 0.90/0.86, physical health
pre/post = 0.92/0.92).
Physical Activity Scale for the Elderly (PASE). This is a brief survey designed specifically
to assess physical activity in epidemiological studies of older adults [37]. The PASE score com-
bined information on leisure, household and occupational activity.
Daily diary
The daily diary was designed by the team to capture information about the participants’ cycle
rides they completed and any other physical activity they took part in during the eight-week
intervention (e.g., walking, sports, other physical activities). Each day, participants were asked
to fill in what time they started and completed any physical activity, the purpose of the activity
(if cycling or walking somewhere) and where they went from and to. For a measure of cycling
time to be calculated, participants recorded the start and end time of each cycle and this time
spent cycling was summed across the week and then averaged over the eight-week period to
provide an average weekly cycling duration.
Data analysis
IBM SPSS Statistics 25 package was used to analyse the data. Any missing data and outliers
(1.5�IQR for that group) for each task were removed and replaced with the mean of the group.
Missing data points and outliers were minimal within the dataset, which were subsequently
imputed with the means of the group, namely < .007% of the total number of observations that
were missing and < .01% of the total number of observations that were outliers. The number of
outliers, χ2 (2) = 3.00, p = .223, and missing data frequencies, χ2 (2) = 6.00, p = .199, did not differ
between the three participant groups. A composite score for executive function was intended to
be used in the analyses. However, the relevant measures at baseline did not significantly correlate
(see S1 Table) and thus it would be meaningless to calculate composite scores. The mental rota-
tion time and average time taken to complete the mazes significantly correlated and so were also
combined to form a single Spatial Function Time composite score (see S2 Table). As mental rota-
tion accuracy and average maze errors did not significantly correlate, separate analyses were con-
ducted on these measures, Bonferroni corrected (alpha level, p < .017). For the memory tasks, the
CERAD immediate and delayed recall significantly correlated (see S3 Table) and so were com-
bined to form a composite CERAD score which was used in subsequent analyses.
For all measures (executive function, memory, spatial function, questionnaires), 2 (session;
before intervention, after intervention) x 3 (group; non-cycling controls, e-bike cyclists, pedal
cyclists) mixed method Analysis of Variance (ANOVAs) were conducted to investigate the
impact of cycling on cognitive function.
Results and discussion
Group composition
The three groups did not differ in years in education, MMSE or pre-intervention physical
activity level, F (2, 97) = .77, p = .466, F (2, 97) = 1.93, p = .151, F (2, 97) = .98, p = .378, respec-
tively (see Table 2). PASE did not differ significantly between groups after the intervention
either, t(98) = 1.547, p = .125 (control M = 35.62, SD = 21.93, cyclist M = 44.47, SD = 26.09).
72% of participants completed the trial during the warmer months to maximise adherence to
the trial. Furthermore, E-bike cyclists (M = 1.86, SD = 1.76), pedal cyclists (M = 2.22,
SD = 1.76) and non-cycling control participants (M = 1.92, SD = 1.65) did not differ in the fre-
quency of doing these other activities, H (2, 97) = 1.08, p = .582, as reported in the PASE. E-

 bike cyclists (M = 1.53, SD = 1.41), pedal cyclists (M = 1.58, SD = 1.25) and non-cycling control
participants (M = 1.62, SD = 1.65) also did not differ in the number of other activities they par-
ticipated in, F (2, 97) = .033, p = .968. Finally, E-bike cyclists (M = 2.50, SD = 2.47), pedal
cyclists (M = 2.58, SD = 2.39) and control participants (M = 2.46, SD = 2.32) did not differ in
the time spent completing these activities, H (2, 97) = .049, p = .976, as reported in the PASE.
Participants continued to report their other physical activities (additional to cycling) that they
conducted throughout the cycling trial (complete diaries received, N = 81). Again, the average
time spent completing other activities did not differ (E-bike [M = 1.21, SD = .54], pedal
[M = 1.21, SD = .38] and control participants [M = 1.27, SD = .30]) across the participant
groups, F (2, 78) = .141, p = .869).
Cycling statistics during the trial
Participants kept a diary of their cycling activity during the trial and recorded the duration of
each journey. We found e-bike cyclists spent marginally more time cycling on average each
week than pedal cyclists, t(72) = 1.80, p = .076 (see Table 3 for Means and SDs). This is likely
due to the ease associated with cycling with a motor, enabling the e-bike participants to cycle
for longer periods of time. This indicates that e-bikes, due to supporting the cycling, may
enable increased activity and durations of cycle rides. Many of the participants commented
that they felt they could go further on the e-bike as they could rely on it to get home if they
could not manage it by themselves (see [38] for a qualitative account of factors affecting cycling
behavior in ‘Older people’s microadventures outdoors on (e-) bikes’).
Additionally, e-bikers spent on average 26% of the time in the highest motor setting (turbo;
SD = 34), 7% in the next highest setting (sport, SD = 11), 24% in tour (SD = 22), 28% in eco
(SD = 26), and 15% (SD = 26) with the motor off. This means that on average for only 15% of
their cycling time, e-bike participants were not using the motor to aid their cycling, thus being
comparable to pedal cyclists.
Participants (pseudonym) often included comments in their daily diary of cycling experi-
ence summing up their belief of the contribution to psychological well-being, for example:
"On Sunday I took the (E-)bike out for the afternoon to cheer myself up. Gloomy day but the
countryside around is lovely so felt better when I came back!" (Alysia)
“After a stressful morning I had time to unwind on the (E-)bike.” (Christopher)

 Executive function measures
Large effect sizes for improvement in executive function after exercise have been demonstrated
[10] and we predicted an increase in executive function in the cycling groups, thus would
expect significant interactions between group and session, with the control group not improv-
ing after the intervention. The ANOVA demonstrated that there was no interaction for verbal
fluency (F(2, 97) = .739, p = .480), plus-minus task (F(2, 97) = 4.07, p = .667), letter updating
(F(2, 97) = 1.92, p = .152), Eriksen interference score (F(2, 97) = .623, p = .538), all measuring
executive function.
There was, however, a significant Group x Session interaction for the Stroop Interference
score, a measure of inhibition, F(2, 97) = 3.77, p = .026, ƞ2 = .072. The smaller the score, the
less interference that the participant experienced from the written word being incongruent
with the ink colour that they were reporting. This measure demonstrated improvement in
both the cycling groups after the intervention, for e-bike cyclists, t(37) = 2.75, p = .009 , and for
pedal cyclists, t(35) = 5.30, p = .000, with less interference after the intervention (see Fig 1),
which was not the case for non-cycling control participants, t(25) = .03, p = .974.
There was also a significant interaction between session and group for Go RTs in the Stop-
It task, a measure of processing speed, F(2, 97) = 3.78, p = .026, ƞ2 = .072 (see Fig 2). E-bike
cyclists had marginally faster RTs after the intervention compared to baseline, t(37) = 1.97, p =
.056, whereas pedal cyclists did not, t(35) = .87, p = .391, and the non-cycling controls had a
trend towards slower RTs, t(25) = -1.75, p = .092.
There was no overall difference between the groups for verbal fluency scores (F(2, 97) =
2.18, p = .119), the plus-minus task (F(2, 97) = .368, p = .693), Stroop interference scores (F(2,
97) = 1.00, p = .905), the Eriksen flanker task (F(2, 97) = 2.28, p = .107) or Stop-IT go-RTs,
measuring processing speed (F(2, 97) = .930, p = .398). There was a main effect of group for
the letter updating task, F(2, 97) = 4.20, p = .018, with both cycling groups being higher overall
in accuracy than the non-cycling control group, t(62) = 2.44, p = .017 (e-bike cyclists compared
to non-cycling controls), t(60) = 2.54, p = .014 (pedal cyclists compared to non-cycling con-
trols). As there were no significant differences in baseline performance across groups (see S1
File), this main effect is mainly driven by the after intervention accuracy being higher for the
cycling groups, t(98) = 3.72, p = .001 (see Fig 3) as demonstrated by the interaction.

 There was no session effect for the plus-minus task (F(2, 97) = 2.81, p = .097) or for the go
RTs in the Stop-IT task, F(2, 97) = .193, p = .662. There was a session effect for the groups over-
all, with improvement after the 8-week period for verbal fluency (F(2, 97) = 8.50, p = .004, ƞ2 =
.081), letter updating, F(2, 97) = 27.41, p = .000, ƞ2 = .221 (see Table 4 for all Means and SDs
for the executive function measures), the Stroop interference score (mainly driven by the
improvement in the cycling groups after the intervention, as well as practice effects improving
performance after the intervention), F(2, 97) = 15.96, p = .000, ƞ 2 = .141, and a marginal ses-
sion effect of the reduction of interference in the Eriksen flanker task, F(2, 97) = 3.73, p = .056,
ƞ2 = .037. These session effects alone are likely due to performance improving overall after the
intervention as a result of practice.

 Memory measures
There was no group, session or interaction effect on the MMSE scores, group effect F(2, 97) =
1.35, p = .264, session effect F(2, 97) = .328, p = .568, interaction F(2, 97) = .616, p = .542. The
CERAD composite did not show an effect of cycling on recall either, group effect F(2, 97) =
.874, p = .420, interaction F(2, 97) = .495, p = .611, which is not surprising given the lower
effect sizes reported for exercise interventions on memory. There was a session effect for the
CERAD composite score, F(2, 97) = 30.84, p = .000, reflecting better performance after the
intervention, t(99) = -5.54, p = .000, ƞ2 = .241, likely due to practice effects.
Spatial function measures
Despite evidence to suggest there are medium effect sizes for spatial function improvement
after exercise [12] and we predicted an increase in this ability in the cycling groups, the
ANOVA demonstrated that there was no interaction or group effect for the Mental Rotation
Task Accuracy, group effect F(2, 97) = .874, p = .420, interaction F(2, 97) = .874, p = .420,
Maze Errors, group effect F(2, 97) = .874, p = .420, interaction F(2, 97) = .874, p = .420, and
Spatial Function Time (Composite of the completion times for the mazes and mental rotation
task), group effect F(2, 97) = .874, p = .420, interaction F(2, 97) = .874, p = .420. Again, there
was a significant session effect in the Spatial Function Time composite indicating the influence
of practice on increased speed from completing the tests again after the intervention, F(2, 97)
= 10.62, p = .002, ƞ2 = .099.

 Well-being and mental health questionnaires
As with spatial function and some of the executive function measures, we predicted to see an
increase in well-being in the cycling groups compared to controls. The ANOVA demonstrated
that there was no interaction, or group effect for the PWB, group effect F(2, 97) = .441, p =
.644, interaction F(2, 97) = 1.48, p = .232, session effect, F(2, 97) = 1.95, p = .166, the SL, group
effect F(2, 97) = 1.03, p = .363, interaction F(2, 97) = .340, p = .713, PANAS positive, group
effect F(2, 97) = 1.95, p = .148, interaction F(2, 97) = 1.01, p = .370 or PANAS negative, group
effect F(2, 97) = 1.52, p = .223, interaction F(2, 97) = 1.22, p = .300, and session F(2, 97) = 1.09,
p = .742, (see Table 5 for Ms and SDs for all well-being measures). There was a session effect
for Positive PANAS items, demonstrating an increase in the positive score in all groups after
the intervention period, F (2, 97) = 8.92, p = .004, ƞ2 = .072. This was also the case for the SL, F
(2, 97) = 8.32, p = .005, ƞ2 = .079.
There was also a marginal interaction between session and group for the mental health
component of the SF-36, F(2, 97) = 4.25, p = .017, ƞ2 = .081, with the e-bike cyclists increasing
in this score, t(37) = -3.45, p = .001, but pedal cyclists and non-cycling controls not, t(35) =
1.56, p = .128, t (25) = 1.03, p = .311 (see Fig 4). There was also a significant session effect (with
an increase in their mental health score after the intervention period), F(2, 97) = 5.13, p = .026,
ƞ2 = .050, but no group effect, p > .05, F = .78. This interaction was not the case for the physical
health component of this measure but there was a session effect, F(2, 97) = 7.74, p = .007, ƞ2 =
.072.
We checked the extent to which more time spent cycling was associated with stronger
improvement in cognitive performance. There was no cycling dose effect on any of the mea-
sures that showed improvement from cycling, so more cycling overall did not relate to greater
improvement in cognitive function or well-being (see S3 File).
Discussion
The aim of this study was to investigate the effect of cycling in the outdoor environment on
cognitive function, specifically executive function, and well-being in older adults. Participants
were asked to cycle for at least an hour and a half each week for an eight-week period, either
on a conventional pedal bike or an electrically assisted e-bike. We expected to find increased
accuracy in a number of different executive function tasks and well-being in the cycling groups
after the intervention compared to baseline and the non-cycling control group.

 In line with our predictions, we found trends for improvement in executive function in the
Stroop task and letter updating task in both cycling groups compared to baseline and the non-
cycling controls. We also found improvement in speed of processing for go trials in the Stop-It
signal task only for e-bike participants during the intervention. Measures of memory and spa-
tial functioning did not show an effect of cycling. Furthermore, we found increases in self-
reported mental health on the SF-36 health survey for only the e-bike cycling group. Despite
strong evidence from previous studies for an increase in well-being after exercise and the
impacts of the outdoor environment on this aspect of mental health, we did not find increases
on the PWB, SL or PANAS questionnaires.
The increase in inhibition and updating suggests that there may be an impact of exercise on
executive function. These results support the notion that even cognitive processes that show
the greatest rate of decline (e.g., executive function, processing speed) remain malleable [3, 4,
5, 6, 9]. The fact that we found effects in the Stroop but not the Eriksen task suggests that these
tasks are tapping into slightly different processes or have different levels of sensitivity, espe-
cially to individual differences, with the latter being more plausible [39]. Hedge et al. (2017)
[39] found that the reliabilities for the Eriksen flanker task measure ranged from .37 to .74.
Change due to a short exercise intervention was demonstrated in the more sensitive tasks of
executive function as per Hedge et al. (2017) [39], namely the Stroop and Letter Updating task,
in the current study.
Executive function aside, exercise has also been shown to increase psychological well-being
[8] and this has the potential to aid maintenance of cognitive function as low well-being and
depression have been linked to poor cognitive function (e.g., [15, 40]). We found an increase
in the mental health component of the SF-36 for e-bike participants, but not an increase in
well-being on the PWB or SL, or positive affect measured by the PANAS for either cycling
group. This was surprising as cycling participants highlighted an increase in their mood and
satisfaction from cycling regularly during the intervention through their diary entries. It may
be that these measures are not sensitive to change over time since they are designed to capture
trait elements that are unlikely to vary, especially over the short period of the intervention, or
even as a function of the intervention (e.g., [41]). The mental health component of the SF-36

 captures individual’s responses to how much any emotional problems have interfered with
their daily and social activities, rather than their subjective opinion on their psychological
well-being. This survey has demonstrated high sensitivity and convergent validity for mental
health issues [42]. Therefore, the SF-36 may be more proficient at detecting change over, even
short periods of, time [42] compared to those measures that we employed that identify more
stable traits (e.g., PWB).
An online exit survey was also conducted several months after their trial had finished, gaug-
ing the extent to which participants were still engaged in cycling; completed by 73 participants.
As participants did not all complete the trial at the same time, participants completed this exit
interview at different points in relation to trial completion. Over two-thirds thought that their
wellbeing had improved a little or a lot compared to before they took part in the trial and that
they had become more physically active. Also, 58% reported that they had cycled and intended
to increase or maintain their level of cycling, and a further 27% reported that they had stopped
but were actively planning to start cycling again.
Importantly, we showed an equal (if not larger) effect for the e-bike group as well as the
pedal cyclists on measures of executive function and well-being. This suggests that it is not just
the physical activity component of cycling that aids executive function. E-bikes require less
physical exertion than the pedal bikes and often are more rewarding for participants to cycle as
they can travel longer distances without having to worry about not being able to get back,
cover greater distance in less time, enable coping with physical ailments that make ordinary
pedal cycling challenging and encourage more cycling time (as demonstrated by our e-bike
participants on average spending longer cycling each week on average). In addition, the nov-
elty of being provided with an e-bike may have increased any effect on cognitive function and
well-being. Increasing older adults’ independence and mobility, reducing isolation and depres-
sion, is likely to have a positive impact on their mental health and cognitive function [43].
We also note that there are limitations to the current study. Due to its high ecological valid-
ity, participants cycling in the natural environment at their own discretion, some participants
cycled above and beyond that which was required, whereas others just met the required cycling
time each week thus adding variability to the data. The control group also, as mentioned previ-
ously, increased their physical activity somewhat due to this being monitored, which may have
reduced the sensitivity of the effects we found of cycling on cognitive function. Furthermore,
we did not employ a more objective measure of change in fitness, such as oxygen uptake (VO2
max).
In summary, we found that cycling over an eight-week period showed trends for improving
a number of different executive functions, particularly updating and inhibition as well as pro-
cessing speed for e-bike participants. As e-bike participants benefitted as much (if not more)
than pedal cyclists, this suggests that it is not just the physical component of the activity but a
number of different aspects of cycling that can improve cognition and mental health, e.g.,
engagement with the outdoor environment, independence and mobility. We did not find
changes, however, in psychological well-being, which may be due to little change on these
measures over the intervention period but we did see trends in the expected direction, particu-
larly pronounced for the mental health component of the SF-36.
E-bikes certainly have the potential to re-engage older adults with cycling and provide a
great opportunity to increase physical activity and engagement with the outdoor environment.
Cycling in general appears to improve some aspects of cognitive function and mental health,
however, controlled trials with more sensitive executive function and well-being tasks are
required to determine the extent of these effects and to quantify the individual contributions
of each component (e.g., physical activity, outdoor engagement, independence, mobility) to
cognitive and well-being improvements in older adults.
