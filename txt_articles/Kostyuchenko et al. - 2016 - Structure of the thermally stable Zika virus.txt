Zika virus (ZIKV), formerly a neglected pathogen, has recently been 
associated with microcephaly in fetuses1, and with Guillian–Barré 
syndrome in adults2. Here we present the 3.7 Å resolution cryo-
electron microscopy structure of ZIKV, and show that the overall 
architecture of the virus is similar to that of other flaviviruses. 
Sequence and structural comparisons of the ZIKV envelope (E) 
protein with other flaviviruses show that parts of the E protein 
closely resemble the neurovirulent West Nile and Japanese 
encephalitis viruses, while others are similar to dengue virus 
(DENV). However, the contribution of the E protein to flavivirus 
pathobiology is currently not understood. The virus particle was 
observed to be structurally stable even when incubated at 40 °C, 
in sharp contrast to the less thermally stable DENV3. This is also 
reflected in the infectivity of ZIKV compared to DENV serotypes 
2 and 4 (DENV2 and DENV4) at different temperatures. The cryo-
electron microscopy structure shows a virus with a more compact 
surface. This structural stability of the virus may help it to survive 
in the harsh conditions of semen4, saliva5 and urine6. Antibodies or 
drugs that destabilize the structure may help to reduce the disease 
outcome or limit the spread of the virus.
Zika virus (ZIKV), a flavivirus, is thought to be principally transmit-
ted to humans by the mosquito (Aedes aegypti) vector. Other flaviviri-
uses include West Nile virus (WNV), Japanese encephalitis virus (JEV), 
dengue virus (DENV) and yellow fever virus (YFV). ZIKV generally 
causes a mild disease. However, when pregnant women are infected 
with ZIKV, there is an increased risk of developing microcephaly in 
the fetus1.
Retrospective analysis of data collected from a ZIKV outbreak in 
French Polynesia in 2013–2014 showed association of the virus with 
microcephaly7. Here we present the 3.7 Å resolution structure of ZIKV 
strain H/PF/2013 isolated during that outbreak8.
For cryo-electron microscopy (cryoEM) studies, ZIKV was grown 
in the mosquito cell line at 28 °C and purified at 4 °C by polyethylene 
glycol precipitation, a sucrose cushion, followed by a potassium tartrate 
gradient. The gel analysis of the purified sample suggested it contained 
mostly mature virus (Extended Data Fig. 1). The ZIKV samples were 
incubated at 28 °C, 37 °C and 40 °C (mimicking high fever) for 30 min, 
before imaging by cryoEM (Fig. 1a). At 28 °C, there were broken and 
shrivelled particles together with some smooth surfaced particles 
(about 500 Å in diameter), similar to the compact DENV mature par-
ticles. Conversely, samples incubated at 37 °C and 40 °C showed many 
more smooth surfaced particles. The presence of a larger fraction of 
shrivelled particles at 28 °C could be due to the exposure of particles to 
high osmolality during purification. We speculate that ZIKV particles 
may expand into smooth surfaced particles when incubated at higher 
temperatures, making the lipid envelope more fluid, and allowing the 
structure to revert to its normal state. Some strains of DENV2 (New 
Guinea C, NGC) undergo notable structural changes from smooth to 
bumpy surfaced particles when incubated at 37 °C (refs 9, 10), whereas 
others (PVP94/07)11 do not. Structurally, DENV4 is considered more 
stable than DENV2 (NGC strain), as it remains as a smooth surfaced 
particle even at 40 °C, although considerable aggregation of particles 
occurs3. ZIKV seemed to be even more stable than DENV4, as the 
smooth surfaced particles did not aggregate at 40 °C (Fig. 1a). This 
is consistent with the plaque assay results with ZIKV, DENV2 strains 
(NGC and PVP94/07) and DENV4 that were pre-incubated at 28 °C, 
37 °C and 40 °C for 30 min. ZIKV retained its infectivity, whereas the 
infectivity of DENV2 strains and DENV4 is significantly reduced 
at higher temperatures (Fig. 1b). The infectivity of ZIKV was only 
slightly reduced when the pre-incubation time was increased to 60 min 
 
(Fig. 1c).
The cryoEM structure was reconstructed from the virus sample incu-
bated at 40 °C for 30 min. The 3.7 Å resolution cryoEM map (Fig. 2a and 
Extended Data Fig. 2) showed well-resolved densities corresponding 
to the α-helices and β-strands. In addition, many side-chain densi-
ties were visible (Fig. 2b). The overall structural architecture of ZIKV 
 
(Fig. 2c) is similar to that of DENV (refs 3, 12–14) and WNV (ref. 15). 
While our paper was under review, a similar ZIKV structure was pub-
lished16 showing similar features. There are 180 copies of each of the 
E and associated M (‘membrane’) proteins on the virus surface; they 
are anchored in the bilayer lipid membrane via their transmembrane

regions. The E protein is the major protein involved in receptor binding 
and fusion. The M protein is a small protein that is hidden under the 
E protein layer. The E and M proteins are organized in icosahedral 
symmetry consisting of 60 repeating units, and each asymmetric unit 
contains three individual E proteins (molecules A, B and C) (Fig. 2c). 
The E proteins are arranged as dimers, with three dimers lying parallel 
to each other forming a raft; there are 30 such rafts covering the viral 
surface. The E ectodomain contains three domains: DI, DII and DIII 
(Fig. 2c, right). DI acts as a bridge between DII and DIII. The tip of DII 
contains the fusion loop, which interacts with the endosomal mem-
brane during fusion. The DI–DII hinge is thought to be important for 
flipping out DII to expose the fusion loop during the fusion event. The 
DI–DIII hinge is thought to be rigid at neutral pH. In most other flavi-
viruses, DIII contains the receptor-binding site17 and has an important 
role in fusion18. After the carboxy-terminal end of the E ectodomain 
is the α-helical stem region that lies on the viral membrane, and the 
α-helical transmembrane region.
The superposition of the three individual E protein molecules (A, 
B and C) in the asymmetric unit of ZIKV showed high similarity 
(Extended Data Fig. 3a), typical for flaviviruses (Extended Data Fig. 3b). 
 
Superposition of DI of molecule A of the ZIKV E protein with that of 
DENV2 (ref. 14) showed a slight difference in the angle at the DI–DIII 
and DI–DII hinges (Extended Data Fig. 3c).
Sequence comparison shows that the ZIKV E protein has similar 
sequence homology levels (ranging from 40 to 58%) to other flavivi-
ruses (Extended Data Fig. 4a). There are some insertions, deletions 
and mutations on the E proteins that are distinct among the neurovir-
ulent viruses (WNV, JEV and tick-borne encephalitis virus (TBEV)) 
and the febrile-illness-causing viruses (YFV and DENV) (Extended 
Data Fig. 4b). However, their contributions to the resultant pathology 
are not clear. A superposition of our ZIKV cryoEM structure onto the 
DENV2 cryoEM14 structure, and the crystal structures of WNV19 and 
JEV20 E proteins show structural similarities (Extended Data Fig. 5), 
which are consistent with the sequence comparisons (Extended Data 
Fig. 4b). For example, ZIKV is similar to DENV at the hi-loop of DII 
(Extended Data Figs 4b and 5a), where both have a three-residue long 
insertion compared to WNV, TBEV and JEV. However, at other sites, 
ZIKV is more similar to the neurovirulent JEV and WNV (Extended 
Data Figs 4b and 5b). For example, sequence comparison shows an 
Asn67Asp mutation in JEV
, WNV and ZIKV compared to DENV
, indi-
cating that the glycosylation site is absent (Fig. 2c). Therefore, there is 
only one Asn154 glycosylation site in an E protein in ZIKV, whereas 
DENV has two (Asn67 and Asn153)14. The Asn154 glycosylation site 
is suggested to be a neurovirulence determinant in WNV21; however, 
DENV also has this glycosylation site but infection with DENV rarely 
results in neurovirulence. The Asn67 (but not Asn153) glycosylation 
site in DENV has been shown to be crucial for binding to DC-SIGN 
(also known as CD209)22 on dendritic cells. ZIKV
, which also interacts 
with DC-SIGN23, does not have this glycosylation site, and therefore 
could have a different binding mechanism.
A longer glycan loop at DI is observed in ZIKV
, WNV and JEV com-
pared with TBEV
, YFV and DENV1–4 (Extended Data Figs 4b and 5b). 
An extra residue is present in the DII kl-loop of WNV
, TBEV
, YFV and 
ZIKV compared to DENV1–4. A residue insertion at the DIII C strand 
in WNV
, JEV
, TBEV and ZIKV was observed as opposed to DENV1–4. 
Finally, there is a two-residue insertion at the DIII DE-loop in WNV, 
JEV and ZIKV compared to TBEV, YFV and DENV1–4 (Extended 
Data Figs 4b and 5b).
Notably, our ZIKV structure shows that the one-residue insertion at 
the end of the C strand of DIII (Extended Data Fig. 4b) compared to 
DENV may increase the overall stability of the virus. For comparison, a 
similar resolution DENV2 cryoEM structure14, which has been shown

to be less stable at increased temperatures9,10, was used. The Ala340 
insertion in the C strand of DIII allows the CD-loop to stretch further 
towards the five-fold vertex compared to DENV2 (Fig. 3a). Gln350 of 
the CD-loop from one DIII could potentially form a hydrogen bond 
with Thr351 from another CD-loop in the neighbouring DIII, and thus 
may create a hydrogen bond network between the five DIIIs (Fig. 3a 
and Extended Data Fig. 6). In comparison, in DENV2, there is a lack 
of interaction between the DIIIs in this region (Fig. 3a). The possible 
hydrogen bond network around the five-fold vertex of ZIKV could be 
responsible for the rotation of the E protein molecule A slightly (6°) 
anticlockwise around the axis parallel to the viral membrane (Fig. 3b, 
 
bottom left). When compared to DENV2, the position of DIII of the 
ZIKV molecule A was at a slightly higher radius, whereas DII dips 
slightly closer to the viral membrane. The stem and transmembrane 
regions showed no notable positional differences in molecule A 
between DENV2 and ZIKV (Fig. 3b, top). The ectodomain of mole-
cule C′, which forms a dimer with molecule A, is positioned at a lower 
radius than DENV2. The stem and transmembrane regions (Fig. 3b, 
bottom right), along with the membrane, are also pressed downward. 
The ectodomains of the B–B′ dimer also lie at a slightly lower radius 
(Extended Data Fig. 7b), although no positional difference in the stem 
and transmembrane regions was observed when compared to DENV2 
(Extended Data Fig. 7a, bottom). These findings suggest that the ZIKV 
has a more compact surface than DENV2.
The E proteins on the surface of some DENV2 strains are shown to 
undergo structural rearrangements at 37 °C (ref. 9). In this structure, 
the A–C′ dimer moves outwards to a higher radius and also rotates 
slightly. The B–B′ dimer moves to a higher radius and the E proteins 
dissociate from each other. A study of an antibody, which traps a tran-
sitional stage of this motion11, suggests that the A–C′ dimer proba-
bly moves to a higher radius before the B–B′ dimer11. In the ZIKV 
structure, the possible network of interactions around the five-fold 
vertex between the five A–C′ dimers may result in tighter packing that 
 
prevents this structural transition.
Both the TIM (T cell, immunoglobulin and mucin) and TAM (Tyro3, 
Axl and Mer) phosphatidylserine transmembrane receptors have been 
shown to be used by DENV for cell entry24. Conversely, ZIKV was 
shown to bind to TAM but not TIM receptors23. It is possible that the 
looser surface of DENV2 compared to ZIKV could allow more inter-
actions with a wider range of phosphatidylserine-binding receptors.
Unlike DENV, ZIKV is detected in the urine6, saliva5 and semen4 
(which allows potential transmission by sexual contact25), suggesting 
that the virus is stable enough to withstand harsh conditions. This 
is consistent with our infection assay showing that ZIKV is more 
 
thermally stable than DENV. Furthermore, the potential interactions 
identified in our structure may explain the stability of ZIKV and may 
serve as potential sites to exploit for future therapeutics.

around the five-fold vertex may cause differences in the position of 
A–C′ dimer compared to DENV2. a, The CD-loops of ZIKV (green) 
are stretched closer towards the five-fold vertex than those in DENV2 
(yellow). In ZIKV, the Gln350 residue may form a hydrogen bond (dashed 
line) to the Thr351 from the CD-loop of a neighbouring DIII, creating a

both ZIKV and DENV2 is coloured grey. Bottom left panel show molecule 
A rotated by 180o to an axis perpendicular to the viral membrane. The 
ZIKV CD-loop (red arrow) is lifted upwards probably owing to the 
five-fold interaction as demonstrated in a; this molecule rotates slightly. 
Bottom right panel shows molecule C′ in the same orientation as in the 
top panel. The whole ZIKV E protein (green) molecule C′ is positioned at 
a lower radius than in DENV2 (yellow). The positions of the ZIKV stem 
(blue arrow) and transmembrane (TM) regions suggest that the membrane 
is pushed downwards compared to DENV2.

No statistical methods were used to predetermine sample size. The experiments 
were not randomized, and investigators were not blinded to allocation during 
experiments and outcome assessment.
Virus plaque assay to determine the stability of ZIKV and DENV serotypes at 
different temperatures. The virus strains used for the plaque assay experiments 
 
were: DENV2 (NGC), DENV2 (PVP94/07), DENV4 (06K2270) and ZIKV 
 
(H/PF/2013). Virus samples were pre-incubated for 30 min at 4 °C, 29 °C, 37 °C 
and 40 °C and chilled at 4 °C for at least 30 min. Samples were serially diluted and 
added to BHK-21 (ATCC) cells grown in 24-well plates. For plaque assays, the 
cells were not specially authenticated, and not tested specifically for mycoplasma 
contamination. Virus was incubated with the cells for 1 h at 37 °C, then layered 
with methyl cellulose. After incubation at 37 °C for 4 days, the cells were fixed and 
stained to determine the plaque-forming units.
A similar experiment was done by pre-incubating ZIKV H/PF/2013 for 60 min 
at the same temperatures, before adding to BHK-21 cells.
Virus sample preparation. ZIKV strain H/PF/2013 was grown in Aedes albop-
ictus C6/36 cells (ATCC) supplemented with RPMI1640 medium and 2% fetal 
bovine serum. The cells were inoculated with ZIKV at a multiplicity of infection 
of 2, and incubated at 29 °C for 3 days. Virus-containing medium was subjected to 
centrifugation at 12,227g for 45 min to remove cells and other debris, and the virus 
was precipitated with 8% (w/v) polyethylene glycol 8000 in NTE buffer (10 mM 
Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 120 mM NaCl and 1 mM EDTA) overnight. Virus was pelleted by 
centrifugation at 14,334g, resuspended in NTE buffer and purified through a 24% 
sucrose cushion. Virus was further purified by ultracentrifugation using a 10–30% 
(w/v) potassium tartrate gradient. Virus band was extracted from the gradient with 
a syringe, and then the sample was buffer-exchanged into NTE buffer and concen-
trated using Amicon Ultra-4 100-kDa centrifugal concentrator (Millipore). Virus 
concentration and purity was estimated by Coomassie-blue-stained SDS–PAGE 
gel, where different concentrations of bovine serum albumin (BSA) solution were 
used as standards. All steps of the purification procedure were done at 4 °C.
CryoEM sample preparation. Virus samples were incubated at 4 °C, 29 °C, 37 °C 
or 40 °C, for 30 min, then kept at 4 °C before freezing on cryoEM grids. About 2 μl 
of sample was put on a copper cryo-EM grid (with lacey carbon covered with thin 
carbon film), blotted for 1 s and plunged in liquid ethane bath using the Vitrobot 
plunger (FEI). The grids were stored in liquid nitrogen.
CryoEM data collection, image processing and 3D reconstruction. Images 
 
of vitrified virus were collected on a Titan Krios (FEI) microscope at 300 kV in 
nanoprobe mode using Leginon software for automated data collection. The mag-
nification was 104,477, giving a pixel size of 1.34 Å. The images were recorded 
on Falcon II direct electron detector (FEI) in movie mode, with 30 frames per 
1.8 s exposure time, giving a total dose of 50 e− Å−2. The individual frames were 
mutually aligned to correct for beam-induced sample drift with the MotionCorr 
program26. The first 10 frames were combined to produce the average image 
for further processing. The higher contrast full dose average was also calculated 
and used for defocus determination and for manual particle picking. In total, 
11,600 individual virus particles from 3,083 micrographs were selected. The 
3D reconstruction was carried out with MPSA27, by using a 3D map of DENV4 
 
(EMD-2485) as the starting model, with icosahedral symmetry averaging. The 
image data was split into two halves and processed with MPSA independently, 
to follow the ‘gold standard’ procedure for resolution determination. After 
 
20 cycles of orientation search and 3D reconstruction, the final map was produced 
by using 7,180 particle images. The resolution of the map is 3.7 Å, at Fourier shell 
correlation cut off of 0.143 (Extended Data Fig. 2).
Model building and refinement. The resolution of the map allowed us to trace 
all of the polypeptide chains: three E and three M proteins. After manual struc-
ture building in Coot28, using DENV2 coordinates (PDB 3J27) as a starting 
template, modified to include insertions, the protein structure had been refined 
with CNS29 with icosahedral symmetry constraints applied, and showed Rwork 
and Rfree values of 37% and 39%, respectively. For refinement, the map has been 
‘sharpened’ with application of a B-factor of −55 and low-pass filtered to 3.7 Å. 
Additional secondary structure restrains were applied to avoid overfitting. After 
refinement, the fit and the geometry of the protein structure was checked using 
Coot tools.

Extended Data Figure 1 | The Coomassie-blue-stained SDS–PAGE 
gel profile of ZIKV. The virus preparation showed clear protein bands 
corresponding to the E protein (50 kDa), capsid (C) protein (15 kDa), 
and M protein (10 kDa). The premembrane (prM) band (25 kDa) is not 
detected, indicating that there is little contamination by immature virus 
particles.
