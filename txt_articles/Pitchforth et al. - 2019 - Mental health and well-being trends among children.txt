Abstract
Background. There is a growing concern about the mental health of children and young
people (CYP) in the UK, with increasing demand for counselling services, admissions for
self-harm and referrals to mental health services. We investigated whether there have been
similar recent trends in selected mental health outcomes among CYP in national health
surveys from England, Scotland and Wales.
Methods. Data were analysed from 140 830 participants (4–24 years, stratified into 4–12,
13–15, 16–24 years) in 36 national surveys in England, Scotland and Wales, 1995–2014.
Regression models were used to examine time trends in seven parent/self-reported variables:
general health, any long-standing health condition, long-standing mental health condition;
Warwick–Edinburgh Mental Wellbeing Score (WEMWBS), above-threshold Strengths and
Difficulties Questionnaire Total (SDQT) score, SDQ Emotion (SDQE) score, General
Health Questionnaire (GHQ) score.
Results. Across all participants aged 4–24, long-standing mental health conditions increased
in England (0.8–4.8% over 19 years), Scotland (2.3–6.0%, 11 years) and Wales (2.6–4.1%,
7 years) (all p < 0.001). Among young children (4–12 years), the proportion reporting high
SDQT and SDQE scores decreased significantly among both boys and girls in England
[SDQE: odds ratio (OR) 0.97 (0.96–0.98), p < 0.001] and girls in Scotland [SDQE: OR 0.96
(0.93–0.99), p = 0.005]. The proportion with high SDQE scores (13–15 years) decreased in
England [OR 0.98 (0.96–0.99), p = 0.006] but increased in Wales [OR 1.07 (1.03–1.10),
p < 0.001]. The proportion with high GHQ scores decreased among English women (16–24
years) [OR 0.98 (0.98–0.99), p = 0.002].
Conclusions. Despite a striking increase in the reported prevalence of long-standing mental
health conditions among UK CYP, there was relatively little change in questionnaire scores
reflecting psychological distress and emotional well-being.
What is already known on this subject?
• There is a growing concern about the mental health and well-being of children and young
people (CYP) in the UK, with increasing demand for counselling services, hospital admis-
sions for self-harm and referrals to specialist Child and Adolescent Mental Health Services.
• Few national data on trends or the prevalence of psychological distress or mental health con-
ditions among CYP have been published in the UK since 2007.
What this study adds
• Our study found a striking increase in the reported prevalence of long-standing mental
health conditions since 1995.
• There was no consistent increase in reported psychological distress among CYP over the last
two decades, when measured using scores in validated questionnaires.
• However, there was some evidence of worsening trends in psychological distress and well-
being of young adults in recent years (since 2011).
Introduction
There has been a growing global concern about the mental health and well-being of children and
young people (CYP) (0–24 years). Increasing rates of anxiety and depression have been reported

 among adolescents and young adults in a number of developed
countries, 1990–2010, although wide variation exists between
different countries (Murray et al., 2012; Bor et al., 2014;
Collishaw, 2015). In the UK, demand for counselling services, hos-
pital admissions for self-harm and referrals to specialist Child and
Adolescent Mental Health Services (CAMHS) have all increased
significantly for this age group in recent years (Hagell et al.,
2015; National Society for Prevention of Cruelty to Children,
2016; Page, 2016; Yeung et al., 2016). There is also some evidence
from survey data of decreases in well-being and increases in emo-
tional problems among teenage girls (Brooks et al., 2015; Fink et al.,
2015) and mental health disorders in young adult women
(Pym, 2016).
Many factors have been proposed as potentially contributing
to increasing mental health problems in this age group. These
include social and economic changes leading to a lengthening of
dependence on parents and delay in reaching more adult levels of
autonomy (Patton et al., 2016), effects of social media (Bell et al.,
2015), the penetration of cyberbullying into all parts of young
people’s lives (Bottino et al., 2015; National Children’s Bureau
and Association of School and College Leaders, 2016) and a
more highly pressurised school culture (Lessof et al., 2016).
More recently, the global financial crisis of 2008 has been linked
to an increase in suicide and wider mental health problems among
both young and older adults in Greece and other European coun-
tries (Divya et al., 2016).
The need to understand and meet the mental health needs of
CYP is reinforced by growing recognition of the importance
of early life for lifetime mental health problems. Three-quarters
of life-time mental health problems (excluding dementia) occur
by age 24 years (Kessler et al., 2005). High levels of unmet need for
mental health services among CYP exist in most localities in the
UK (McShane and Rouse, 2015). Failure to meet these needs may
have economic as well as personal and social costs, as there is good
evidence that early access to appropriate health services has a
potential to improve outcomes of both mild/moderate and more
serious mental health problems (Marshall et al., 2005; Hagell
et al., 2015; Hargreaves et al., 2015; National Institute for Health
and Care Excellence (NICE) and NHS England, 2016).
Robust, national-level data on the prevalence and patterns of
mental health problems among CYP are needed for planning and
improving clinical services, understanding societal influences on
mental health and evaluating the impact of different policies for
CYP in UK countries. However, no detailed national studies have
been done that specifically investigate trends in the mental health
of CYP (0–24 years) in the UK since the studies performed in
2004 and 2007 (Green et al., 2005; Parry-Langdon, 2008). To address
this gap, we aimed to analyse trends in mental health outcomes
among CYP in national health surveys from England, Scotland
and Wales over the last two decades. We also included data on
total long-standing conditions (physical and mental health) and gen-
eral health as mental health is a major component of each of these.
Methods
Design
Retrospective, secondary analysis of data from nationally repre-
sentative, cross-sectional, repeated (mostly annual) surveys in
the UK. Data were analysed from 140 830 participants (4–24
years) in 36 national surveys in England, Scotland and Wales,
1995–2014.
Data
All national health surveys conducted since 1995 in England,
Scotland, Wales or Northern Ireland were accessed. These are
repeated, household-based, surveys that use stratified random
sampling of individuals from a sample of postcode sectors each
year to collect nationally representative data using consistent
methodology (Darlington et al., 2014; Scottish_Government;
Welsh_Government). The documentation of each survey was
searched for all mental and physical health variables applicable
to participants aged 0–24 years. At this stage, Northern Ireland
was excluded as only one survey in 2007 contained relevant data,
so trend analysis was not possible. Children under the age of
4 years were also excluded as no mental health variables were
collected in this age group, with the exception of parent-reported
long-standing mental health condition, which was very rare.
For all measures, parents responded on behalf of children aged
4–12 years. Participants aged 13–15 years were invited to com-
plete the survey themselves in England and Wales, while in
Scotland, either parents or young people could complete the sur-
vey in this age group. In all countries, young people aged 16 years
or over responded for themselves.
Table 1 presents the mental and physical health variables
that were available for analysis by age, year and country. Data
on 140 830 participants 4–24 years were analysed from the
Health Survey for England (HSE) (18 surveys between 1995 and
2014, N = 92 422, 49.4% male), Scottish Health Survey (SHS)
(eight surveys 2003–2014, N = 16 862, 49.0% male) and Welsh
Health Survey (WHS) (eight surveys 2007–2014, N = 31 546,
49.9% male). See Appendix Table A for numbers of males and
females in each survey. Response and missingness rates have
been published previously and are fairly consistent over time
and between countries. For example, in the HSE 2014, individual
response rates were 63% (0–15 years) and 55% (16+ years); miss-
ingness rates were <0.5% for general health, long-standing illness
and mental health condition; 2.9% for WEMWBS; and 13.0% for
GHQ. Due to these low rates of missingness, missing data were
not imputed. All data are publically available and were down-
loaded through the UK Data Service https://www.ukdataservice.
ac.uk/. Data were merged and cleaned for time-series analysis fol-
lowing previously published guidance (Darlington et al., 2014).
Outcomes
General health (physical and mental)
– Self-/parent-reported health: dichotomised as very good/good
v. fair/bad/very bad;
– Note that Welsh response options for adults were excellent/very
good/good v. fair/poor;
– Presence of any long-standing condition: yes/no (England and
Scotland only). In Wales, a similar but differently worded
question was asked (presence of any currently treated chronic
illness: yes/no).
Mental health
– Presence of any long-standing mental health condition: yes/no
(England and Scotland only). Please note that long-standing
mental health conditions are a subset of those who reported
‘any long-standing condition’. Depending on the survey and
year, participants may have either chosen the category ‘mental
health’ from a list of long-standing conditions or given an asso-
ciated free-text response. Note that the ‘mental health’ category

 does not include problems related to memory, learning/under-
standing/concentrating or social/behavioural problems (exam-
ples given in the HSE are autism/attention-deficit disorder/
Asperger’s syndrome). Also note that in Wales, a slightly differ-
ent question was asked;
- Presence of any currently treated mental health problem: yes/no;
- Strengths
and
Difficulties
Questionnaire
Total
difficulties
(SDQT) score (Goodman et al., 2000).
Both the total score and a dichotomised score of 0–16 v. 17–40
were analysed.
– Strengths and Difficulties Questionnaire Emotional difficulties
(SDQE) score (Goodman et al., 2000): the full score and a
dichotomised score of 0–4 v. 5–10 were analysed. We investi-
gated the SDQE score separately to the total SDQ as previous
studies have raised specific concerns about increasing rates of
emotional distress, especially among adolescent girls (Fink
et al., 2015). Detailed analysis of other subscales was beyond
the scope of this study. For both SDQT and SDQE, we used
thresholds previously published for analysis of parent-reported
SDQ scores for children aged 4–17 years (Youth_in_Mind,
2016). Individuals who scored above the described threshold
were considered to have screened positive for significant mental
health symptoms.
– General Health Questionnaire (GHQ) score (Goldberg et al.,
1997): the total score and a dichotomised score (0–3 v. 4–12)
were analysed, following previous analysis of GHQ scores in
the HSE (Knott).
– Warwick–Edinburgh Mental Wellbeing Scores (WEMWBS)
(Clarke et al., 2011). No standard threshold has been published,
so only the total score was analysed.
The wording of the questions and responses in each question-
naire is presented in Appendix Table B.
Analysis
For consistency between countries, the data were analysed in three
age bands: children 4–12 years, early adolescents 13–15 years and
young people 16–24 years. We limited ourselves to descriptive
analyses of differences between countries and did not formally
test these due to differences in survey methodology. Within
each country, the proportion of males and females reporting
each dichotomous variable was compared.
For each country, unweighted logistic regression models were
performed for each dichotomous variable on time (in years).

 Similarly, unweighted linear regression models were performed
for each scale variable on time (in years) for each country.
Quadratic time function was included in each model where it
was statistically significant ( p < 0.05). No other covariates were
included. Models were performed for all participants and then
repeated for males and females separately. Some datasets included
weights based on either sampling probability or a combination
of sampling probability and non-response; for England, weighting
data for adults were only available from 2002 onwards. Sensitivity
analyses were performed comparing the outputs of regression
models with weighted and unweighted data.
Additionally, sensitivity analyses were performed to investigate
the recent trends from 2011 to 2014.
Due to the large number of comparisons, a p value of <0.01
was considered significant. All analyses were performed using
SPSS version 22.
Ethics
No ethics review was needed for these secondary analyses of
publically available, anonymised data. The authors assert that
all procedures contributing to this work comply with the ethical
standards of the relevant national and institutional committees
on human experimentation and with the Helsinki Declaration
of 1975, as revised in 2008.
Results
There was a consistent increase in long-standing mental health
conditions over time (see Fig. 1). Across all participants aged
4–24 years, the prevalence increased sixfold over the 19-year per-
iod in England (from 0.8% to 4.8%, p < 0.001), more than doubled
in Scotland over 11 years (2.8–6.5%, p < 0.001) and increased by
more than half in Wales over 7 years (2.6–4.1%, p < 0.001).
Over the corresponding time periods, the prevalence of total long-
standing conditions decreased slightly in England (22.6–19.5%,
p < 0.001), increased slightly in Scotland (19.3–22.0%, p < 0.001)
and was unchanged in Wales (12.8% v. 13.5%, p = 0.10).
The prevalence of each health problem by country, age and sex
is summarised below and presented in Appendix Table C. Findings
from the regression models for each country are presented in
Tables 2–4. All tables show unweighted data. Repeating the ana-
lyses with weighting (where available) had minimal impact on
these findings (see Appendix Table D).
Scotland
Table 2 reported the long-standing mental health conditions
increased between 2003 and 2014. This increase was seen in all age
groups [4–12 years, 2.6% v. 4.8%, odds ratio (OR) 1.05, p = 0.004;
13–15 years, 3.0% v. 7.8%, OR 1.07, p = 0.02; 16–24 years, 3.1% v.
9.7%, OR 1.08, p < 0.001). This can be interpreted as a 5, 7 and 8%
increase per year in the odds of having a long-standing mental
health condition in each age group, respectively.
The prevalence of any long-standing condition increased in 16–
24 years old (18.1% v. 25.6%, OR 1.04, p = 0.001). There was no
change in general health, GHQ or well-being scores over time in
any group. The only trend towards improved health was a signifi-
cant reduction in high SDQT and SDQE scores among girls aged
4–12 years (SDQT: 7.2% v. 4.8%, OR 0.95, p = 0.009; SDQE: 9.6%
v. 6.1%, OR 0.96, p = 0.005). No quadratic terms were significant.
In contrast to stable longer term trends, GHQ score increased
(worsened) significantly for 16–24 year olds between 2011 and
2014 (OR 0.15, p = 0.003). Conversely, there was no change between
2011 and 2014 in the reported prevalence of any long-standing con-
dition in any age group and self-reported general health improved
significantly in 16–24 years old over this period (OR 1.18, p =
0.007). For all other variables, including long-standing mental health
conditions, trends from 2011 to 2014 were broadly similar to the
longer term trends (see Appendix Table E).
Wales
There was no change in any measure among the 4–12 years
group. There was a significant increase in high SDQE scores
among 13–15 years old (14.4% v. 24.2%, OR 1.07, p = <0.001)
and in young adults reporting treatment for mental health condi-
tions (4.1% v. 7.6%, OR 1.11, p < 0.001). In contrast, there was no
change over time in general health or prevalence of any long-
standing condition. There were no significant quadratic terms.
Data from 2011 to 2014 on 16–24 years old showed ongoing
increased prevalence of mental health disorders (OR 1.14, p =
0.005) and also showed an increased prevalence of any chronic
illness (OR 1.08, p = 0.007). Recent trends for all other variables
were similar to longer term trends, showing a significant increase
in SDQE and SDQT for 13–15 years old, and no change in other
variables (see Appendix Table E).
England
There was a consistent increase in the reported prevalence of
long-standing mental health conditions across all age and sex

SDQT, Strengths and Difficulties Questionnaire Total Score (binary score 0–16 v. 17–36); SDQE, Strengths and Difficulties Questionnaire Emotion Score (binary score 0–4 v. 5–10); GHQ, General Health Questionnaire (binary score 0–3 v. 4–12); WEMWBS,
Warwick–Edinburgh Mental Health and Wellbeing Score.
For all binary variables, odds ratios show the change in odds per year over the study period. Values >1 indicate increasing odds of poor health over time. For scale variables (SDQE, SDQT, WEMWBS), the β coefficient represents the change in score per
year over time. Positive values indicate increasing number of symptoms (SDQT, SDQE) or increasing well-being score (WEMWBS).

 groups (range 5.5–9.1% year-on-year increase between 1995 and
2014) (4–12 years: 0.9% v. 3.9%, OR 1.070, p < 0.001; 13–15
years: 1.1% v. 5.4%, OR 1.08, p < 0.001; 16–24 years: 0.6% v.
5.9%, OR 1.09, p < 0.001). Conversely, there was a consistent
reduction in the prevalence of any long-standing condition over
the same period (4–12 years: 21.5% v. 18.2%, OR 0.98, p <
0.001; 13–15 years: 23.8% v. 18.8%, OR 0.97, p < 0.001; 16–24
years: 23.6% v. 21.7%, OR 0.98, p < 0.001).
The ORs of fair/bad general health decreased among younger
participants (4–12 years: OR 0.97, p < 0.001; 13–15 years: OR
0.97, p < 0.001) but not among young adults (OR 0.99, p =
0.07). High SDQT and SDQE scores among young children
became less common over time (SDQT: OR 0.98, p < 0.001;
SDQE: OR 0.97, p < 0.001) as did high SDQE scores for 13–15
years old (OR 0.98, p = 0.006). There was no change in high
SDQT or GHQ scores for 13–15 years old.
The proportion of young adults with high GHQ scores
decreased over time (OR 0.99, p = 0.005); within the data avail-
able (2010–2014), no change was observed in well-being scores
in this age group. Quadratic terms were significant for well-
being and GHQ among 16–24 years old, suggesting that
well-being
and
psychological
distress
may
have
initially
improved between 2010 and 2012 before deteriorating from
2012 to 2014 (WEMWBS linear coefficient = 12.0, p < 0.001,
quadratic coefficient = −0.336, p < 0.001; GHQ linear coefficient
= 0.81, p < 0.001, quadratic coefficient = 1.01, p < 0.001). No
other quadratic terms were significant.
Consistent with these quadratic findings, data from 2011 to
2014 showed a highly significant decrease in WEMWBS scores for
16–24 years old (β coefficient = −0.46, p = 0.001). However, there
was no significant change in GHQ scores over this period. Recent
trends for other variables largely reflected longer term trends,
although the prevalence of any long-standing condition was stable
rather than decreasing (please see Appendix Table E). Please note
that SDQ data were not collected in the HSE after 2011.
Gender analyses
Analysis of all children aged 4–12 years across the total study
period showed that long-standing mental health conditions were
more common among boys than girls: England 3.5% v. 1.1%
( p < 0.001), Scotland 5.3% v. 1.6% ( p < 0.001), Wales 1.5% v. 0.8%
( p < 0.001). High SDQT scores were also more common among
boys than girls: England 10.6% v. 6.9% ( p < 0.001), Scotland 9.8%
v. 5.4% ( p < 0.001), Wales 10.3% v. 6.1% ( p < 0.001).
Gender differences for the 13–15 age group were less consist-
ent. Boys were more likely than girls to report long-standing men-
tal health conditions (England 3.4% v. 1.7%, p < 0.001; Scotland
5.1% v. 2.6%, p < 0.001), any long-standing condition (England
24.8% v. 21.4%, p = <0.001; Scotland 21.2% v. 18.3%, p = 0.05)
and high SDQT (England 9.1% v. 7.3%, p = 0.002). Conversely,
girls were more likely than boys to report high SDQE (England
12.9% v. 7.7%, p < 0.001), high GHQ (England 13.9% v. 7.3%,
p < 0.001; Scotland 11.9% v. 7.0%, p < 0.001) and lower well-being
(Scotland 50.0% v. 52.1%, p < 0.001). Sex differences were smaller
in Wales in this age group, with the exception of high SDQE
scores, which were more common among girls than boys
(23.8% v. 11.4%, p < 0.001).
Among young adults, high GHQ scores were more common,
and mean WEMWBS scores were lower, among women than men:
[GHQ: England 19.2% v. 10.9% ( p < 0.001), Scotland 19.2% v.
11.9% ( p < 0.001); WEMWBS: England 50.7% v. 52.0 ( p < 0.001),
Scotland 49.1% v. 50.5 ( p < 0.001)]. Long-standing mental health
conditions were more common among women than men in
Wales [6.6% v. 3.6% ( p < 0.001)] but not in England [2.7% v.
2.5% ( p = 0.2)], or Scotland [6.2% v. 4.6% ( p = 0.02)].
Discussion
To our knowledge, this is the first national-level study to investi-
gate the UK time trends in mental health problems in CYP since
2007. We found a consistent and striking increase in the reported
prevalence of a long-standing mental health condition in all three
countries. Among CYP aged 4–24 years, the reported prevalence
of long-standing mental health conditions increased sixfold
between 1995 and 2014 in England and more than doubled
between 2003 and 2014 in Scotland. In Wales, where participants
were asked to report only conditions for which they were receiv-
ing treatment, mental health conditions increased by around half
among young adults over the period 2007–2014. Over the same
period, reported prevalence of any long-standing condition (of
which long-standing mental health conditions are a growing sub-
set) decreased significantly in England. Scales measuring psycho-
logical distress showed inconsistent trends, with improvements in
SDQT, SDQE and GHQ scores for some age groups in England
and Scotland, but deterioration in Welsh SDQE scores for 13–
15 years old. Sex differences were as expected from previous
studies.
Where direct comparisons were possible, the trends for 2011–
2014 were broadly similar to the longer term trends for most vari-
ables, although as expected, the recent trends were less statistically
significant in many cases. However, there was some evidence of
worsening trends in the health of young adults in recent years
(increased GHQ scores in Scotland, increased chronic illnesses
in Wales and lower well-being scores in England).
There are some limitations to this study arising from the sur-
vey content and methodology. The Welsh and Scottish surveys
only provide consistent data from 2007 and 2008 onwards,
respectively. In comparison, the HSE data provide good coverage
over a 19-year period but analysis is limited by some inconsisten-
cies in the content and methodology. For example, GHQ data
were not collected in 1996, 2007 and 2013; SDQ data were not
collected in 1998, 2000, 2001, 2003, 2009 and/or from 2012
onwards; WEMWBS data were only available from 2010 onwards.
While the questions about long-standing illness were included in
every survey, the wording and structure has evolved over time. For
example, the question changed from ‘Do you have any long-
standing illness, disability or infirmity?’ (used until 2011) to ‘Do
you have any have any physical or mental health conditions or ill-
nesses lasting or expected to last 12 months or more?’ (used from
2012 onwards).
However, there was no evidence from the quadratic analyses,
the separate analyses of recent trends or from Fig. 1 that this
wording change had any significant impact on the trend to
increased mental health disorders.
Another significant limitation to interpreting these findings is
the lack of data on the impact or nature of a mental health con-
dition. Validated items on impact are available as an additional
part of the SDQ and could usefully be included in future surveys.
Regarding the nature of mental health conditions, it is not pos-
sible to investigate how self-/parents’ understanding of mental
health conditions compares to clinical definitions or whether
these understandings have changed over time. However, there is
little evidence to suggest that increases in developmental or

 behavioural disorders can explain the greater reported prevalence
of long-standing mental health conditions, especially as the
increases are more pronounced among young adults. Lastly,
weighting was not available for adult participants of the HSE
before 2002, and weighting methodology has subsequently chan-
ged over time. However, the high level of agreement between
unweighted and weighted analyses, where direct comparison is
possible, provides some reassurance that lack of weighting infor-
mation and/or changing composition of the sample over time
are unlikely to affect our findings significantly. Similarly, response
rates are reasonably consistent over time.
Our findings are consistent with the previous evidence of
increasing rates of mental health diagnoses among CYP in recent
decades across many high-income countries. Collishaw (2015)
identified several possible factors that may have contributed to
higher rates of mental health diagnoses, including increased help-
seeking by parents and young people, improved screening and
clinical recognition in schools and primary care, medicalisation
of feelings and behaviours previously considered as normal, as
well as a possible genuine increase in pathology (Collishaw,
2015). Green et al. (2005) reported a discrepancy between rates
of diagnosis based on a clinical interview (10%) and self-report
of mental health diagnosis (1–3%) (Green et al., 2005). It is pos-
sible, therefore, that much of the reported increase in mental
health conditions may simply reflect narrowing of the gap
between problems that exist and problems that are reported –
for example, due to increased awareness of mental health pro-
blems, and/or reduced stigma in acknowledging and seeking
help for problems. Although this study could not investigate the
impact of specific programmes, it is possible that initiatives
such
as

(TAMHS)
(National_Child_and-Maternal_Health_Intelligence_Network) and
Improving Access to Psychological Therapies for Children and
Young People (CYP IAPT) (NHS_England) in England may
have contributed to greater awareness of mental health issues
among professionals in schools and primary care, as well as
among parents and CYP themselves.
Our findings differ from previous studies that reported an
increase in emotional distress, and decrease in emotional well-
being in adolescents, alongside a widening gender gap between
girls and boys. For example, Fink et al. (2015) reported an
increase in emotional distress in 11–13 years old girls in
England between 2009 and 2014, and the Health Related
Behaviour in School-Age Children (HBSC) study reported a
trend to decreased well-being of 15-year-old girls in England,
2002–2014 (Brooks et al., 2015; Fink et al., 2015) Similarly, ana-
lyses of data from the Longitudinal Study of Young People in
England (LSYPE) showed that mean GHQ scores were slightly
worse in 2014 than in 2005 and that the gap between girls and
boys had widened slightly over this period (Lessof et al., 2016).
In contrast, we did not find any increase in mental health pro-
blems among early adolescent girls in England or Scotland, and
SDQE scores decreased significantly among 13–15 years old
girls in England. With the exception of 4–12 years old in
Scotland (where girls had lower SDQT than boys and showed a
greater decrease over time), we found no significant difference
in trends between males and females for any country or age
group. However, we note that our analyses are over a longer
time
period
than
many
comparable
studies,
especially
in
England, so their findings are not directly comparable. As noted
above, sensitivity analyses of the most recent four surveys
(2011–2014) show that trends during this period are broadly
consistent with longer term trends, but there was some evidence
of worsening trends in the health of young adults.
Clinical, policy and research implications
Although the year-on-year changes are relatively small in many
cases, the sustained trends over many years have led to significant
changes in population-level prevalence of long-standing mental
health conditions among CYP in the UK (as highlighted in
Fig. 1), with significant implications for health services. Parental
or CYP perceptions of a long-standing mental health condition
may have an important impact on clinical consultations and the
success of treatment for both mental and physical health pro-
blems. Most UK clinicians have responsibility for some patients
aged 0–24 years and should be aware of the increasing need to
consider mental health diagnoses in this age group. For mental
health professionals, the differing trends between reported long-
standing mental health conditions and questionnaire scores sug-
gest that the use and interpretation of such scores in assessing
patients should continue to evolve. Further investigation is
needed, but it is possible that an increasing range of mental health
issues is not adequately captured by existing questionnaires.
Although our data do not allow us to attribute causality, or to
separate the effect of multiple interacting influences on mental
health, our findings are nevertheless relevant to several current
policy debates. The growing burden of mental health problems
faced by CYP, both in absolute terms, and as a proportion of
all long-standing health conditions (mental and physical) rein-
forces the growing demand for CAMHS services, which is already
posing an important challenge for UK health services and policy-
makers. Even positive initiatives such as CYP IAPT and increased
funding for CAMHS are unlikely to address the scale of unmet
need for CAMHS services that has been widely reported elsewhere
and is reinforced in our data. However, as many of the determi-
nants and potential solutions to mental health problems in CYP
lie beyond healthcare (Ford et al., 2007; Newlove-Delgado et al.,
2015), multi-sectoral initiatives will also be needed to address
wider determinants of mental health problems, ranging from pov-
erty and impact of cuts to benefits and youth services, to modern
societal pressures of cyberbullying and early sexualisation.
Our findings also highlight some interesting research gaps.
First, better data are clearly needed to inform and evaluate the
national CAMHS strategy, and so improve short- and long-term
outcomes of mental health problems in CYP. Second, the appar-
ent paradox of increasing rates of long-standing mental health
conditions but no consistent increase in psychological distress
deserves further investigation. One possibility is that there has
been a change in the distribution of common symptoms such
as sadness and anxiety within society. For example, Lessof et al.
reported a trend towards higher mean GHQ scores, despite no
change in the proportion of people reporting above-threshold
scores (Lessof et al., 2016). Our data replicate this finding for
young women in Scotland and young men in England, with a sig-
nificant increase in mean GHQ score over time, but no increase in
the proportion with above-threshold scores. However, it is not
clear whether this reflects a genuine change in the distribution
of mental health symptoms, or just that the GHQ total score is
a more sensitive measure of change. Interestingly, the reverse pat-
tern is seen in English 13–15 years old for all SDQT scores and
female SDQE score (i.e. a significant decrease in mean overall
score, but no decrease in the proportion with above-threshold
score). It is also possible that the threshold for self-/parent report

 of a mental health condition has diverged over time from clinical
thresholds, which may explain some of the discrepancy we found
between trends for self-/parent reports of a long-standing mental
health condition and above-threshold questionnaire scores. The
detailed national study of mental health problems in CYP that
is currently underway may allow more detailed investigation of
this issue.
Lastly, trends in socio-economic inequalities were beyond the
scope of this study, but deserve more detailed investigation in the
future. LSYPE data showed that, while trends towards increased
GHQ scores were particularly marked in CYP from single-parent
and reconstituted families, other measures of psychological dis-
tress now appeared to be more prevalent among CYP living in
more affluent households (Lessof et al., 2016).
Conclusions
There has been a striking increase in the reported prevalence of
long-standing mental health conditions among CYP in England,
Scotland and Wales in recent years, over a period of progressive
improvement in many physical and general health measures.
We report an apparent discrepancy between increases in reported
prevalence of long-standing mental health disorders and relatively
little change in scores on questionnaires relating to psychological
distress and emotional well-being. This discrepancy deserves fur-
ther investigation.
Our findings reinforce the need to consider what constitutes a
mental health problem for young people and to continue to pri-
oritise resources to help young people and their families overcome
difficulties they are experiencing. While policy initiatives to pro-
mote access to CAMHS services and parity of esteem for mental
and physical health are clearly needed, they may be ineffective
unless they are adequately funded and accompanied by parallel
measures to promote mental health and well-being in schools
and wider society.
