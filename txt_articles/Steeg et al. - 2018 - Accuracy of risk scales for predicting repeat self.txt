Abstract
Background: Risk scales are used widely in the management of patients presenting to hospital following self-harm.
However, there is evidence that their diagnostic accuracy in predicting repeat self-harm is limited. Their predictive
accuracy in population settings, and in identifying those at highest risk of suicide is not known.
Method: We compared the predictive accuracy of the Manchester Self-Harm Rule (MSHR), ReACT Self-Harm Rule
(ReACT), SAD PERSONS Scale (SPS) and Modified SAD PERSONS Scale (MSPS) in an unselected sample of patients
attending hospital following self-harm. Data on 4000 episodes of self-harm presenting to Emergency Departments
(ED) between 2010 and 2012 were obtained from four established monitoring systems in England. Episodes were
assigned a risk category for each scale and followed up for 6 months.
Results: The episode-based repeat rate was 28% (1133/4000) and the incidence of suicide was 0.5% (18/3962). The
MSHR and ReACT performed with high sensitivity (98% and 94% respectively) and low specificity (15% and 23%).
The SPS and the MSPS performed with relatively low sensitivity (24–29% and 9–12% respectively) and high
specificity (76–77% and 90%). The area under the curve was 71% for both MSHR and ReACT, 51% for SPS and 49%
for MSPS. Differences in predictive accuracy by subgroup were small. The scales were less accurate at predicting
suicide than repeat self-harm.
Conclusions: The scales failed to accurately predict repeat self-harm and suicide. The findings support existing
clinical guidance not to use risk classification scales alone to determine treatment or predict future risk.

Background
Emergency Departments (EDs) in England treat over
200,000 presentations for self-harm (intentional self-
poisoning or self-injury) each year [1], and the appro-
priate management of these individuals is important.
Clinicians are required to manage a number of risks
when treating this population. People who have self-
harmed are at greater risk of suicide [2], other causes
of premature mortality [3] and comorbid conditions
such as alcohol misuse [4] compared to the general
population. In efforts to help mental health and non-
specialist clinicians manage patients, many hospitals
use risk scales, which aim to score or classify patients
according to their risk of future self-harm or suicide
based on the presence or absence of a specified set of
characteristics.
Psychosocial assessment by a mental health clinician is a
central component of clinical care and is recommended
for each episode of self-harm [5]. These in-depth assess-
ments help clinicians to formulate decisions about follow-

 up care and reach an informed decision about the risk of
further self-harm. There is also evidence that psychosocial
assessment may reduce the risk of a further self-harm
episode [6, 7]. Formal risk scales are used often by ED and
psychiatric clinicians. One study of 32 hospitals across
England found that over 20 different risk scales were being
used with people who presented after self-harm [8]. This
suggests they are in widespread use, with little consensus
about which should be used or how well they predict
future risk.
A recent systematic review compared the diagnostic
accuracy of predicting repeat self-harm of a number of
scales [9]. There were no scales that performed well
enough to be recommended for use in clinical practice.
Another recent meta-analysis pooled positive predictive
values from 52 studies of psychological scales predicting
repeat self-harm and suicide [10]. The results suggested
high-risk classification approaches were unlikely to be
clinically useful but also reported high between-study
heterogeneity. Another study measured the accuracy of
the SAD PERSONS Scale (SPS) for predicting suicide
following an emergency department presentation, using
administrative data to identify suicide deaths [11]. The
study found that the predictive accuracy of the SPS was
inadequate to support the use of this risk scale. However,
there have been few head-to-head comparisons of risk
scales within the same cohort. A comparatively small
study (n = 483) found that the levels of diagnostic accur-
acy reached by the five scales investigated meant they
had limited clinical utility [12]. The risk scales also
performed worse at predicting repeat self-harm than
simply asking the clinician or patient to rate their
risk. However, the study only recruited individuals re-
ceiving a psychosocial assessment from mental health
clinician (typically only around 55% of all self-harm
patients who present to the ED receive a psychosocial
assessment) [6, 13]. This study was too small to
consider the outcome of most concern to clinicians –
suicide, or to examine diagnostic accuracy of the
scales in different subgroups. In the current study we
therefore aimed to test four of the risk scales tested
in previous research, using data from a large unse-
lected cohort of people presenting to the ED after
self-harm.
Aims of the study
Our specific objectives were:
– To estimate predictive accuracy of the risk scales,
using established cut-off points, for identifying a)
repeat self-harm and b) suicide
– To test for differences in the predictive accuracy of
the scales by groups (age, sex, method of self-harm,
professional background of the assessor and self-
harm history)
Our hypothesis was that the poor predictive ability of
risk scales found in previous smaller studies would hold
for this larger unselected hospital cohort and would be
replicated for suicide as an outcome.
Methods
Data sources
Data were obtained from self-harm cohorts in four
separate
centres
in
England.
Each
centre
has
an
established system to collect data relating to episodes
of self-harm presenting to the study EDs. Two of the
centres (Bristol and Oxford) are based in the South
of England, one in the Midlands (Derby) one in the
North (Manchester). The centres collected data from
one hospital each with the exception of Manchester,
which included three hospitals. The EDs in the study
hospitals each had access to psychiatric liaison teams
alongside emergency out-of-hours cover from crisis
teams or junior psychiatrists.
For all self-harm episodes, basic data were avail-
able on method of self-harm (including drugs taken
in self-poisoning), time of presentation, age, gender
and
initial
hospital
management
(for
example,
admission to a medical bed, referral for a psychiatric
assessment). For individuals who were subsequently
referred to liaison psychiatry services for a psycho-
social
assessment,
additional
data
were
available
including factors precipitating the self-harm, circum-
stances of the act (such as planning and suicidal intent),
social circumstances (such as living arrangements and
marital status) and symptoms of depression. For the
present study, 1000 consecutive episodes of self-harm, in-
cluding any repeat episodes by the same individuals, were
extracted from each centre’s cohort. The presentations
took place over different time periods in each centre but
all were between 2010 and 2012. Repeat episodes of
self-harm by individuals were included to reflect the real-
world ED environment and to be in line with clinical guid-
ance that each episode of self-harm should be assessed
comprehensively
[5].
In
order
to
preserve
the
observational nature of the data, no selection/exclusion
criteria were applied.
In addition to information from the study hospitals,
individuals in three of the centres were matched to
Office for National Statistics (ONS) records held by the
National Health Service [https://digital.nhs.uk]. For indi-
viduals who died, information about the cause of death,
verdict and date of death were available. In one of the
centres, suicide deaths were identified from the local
coroner’s office.

 Scales
We compared the predictive accuracy of the following
risk scales: the Manchester Self-Harm Rule (MSHR)
[14], the ReACT Self-Harm Rule (ReACT) [15], the SAD
PERSONS Scale (SPS) [16] and the Modified SAD
PERSONS Scale (MSPS) [17]. The MSHR and ReACT
both consist of four items, with a ‘yes’ to at least one of
the items resulting in a high risk categorisation and ‘no’
to all items corresponding to low risk. The SPS and the
MSPS both include ten items and classify episodes into
three risk categories (low, moderate and high). The
MSPS also weights four of the items, resulting in
maximum score of 14. The items included in each of these
scales and the cut-off points for the risk categories are
shown in Additional file 1: Table S1. Scales were selected
based on an existing systematic review of the diagnostic
accuracy of risk scales for predicting self-harm [9]. We in-
cluded scales that could be re-constructed from routinely
recorded
information
following
a
self-harm
hospital
presentation. The scales were also included in a previous
study that compared their predictive accuracy when ad-
ministered by a mental health clinician as part of the psy-
chosocial assessment [12].
Due to the observational nature of the study, some of
the individual items for the risk scales were derived from
variables related to the core items of interest. For ex-
ample, the item ‘Stated future intent’ from the two SAD
PERSONS Scales was derived in three centres from the
Suicide Intent Scale [18] and in another from a binary
‘yes/no’ question about current suicidal plans. In another
example, the SPS item ‘Depression or hopelessness’ was
available for two of the four sites: in one site it was de-
rived from the presence of either one or two of the items
‘depression’ and ‘hopelessness’ within a list of eight
symptoms of depression and in another it was derived
from the presence of a diagnosis of affective disorder at
the time of presentation.
Outcome measures
Repeat attendance to the study hospitals with an episode
of self-harm within 6 months was our first outcome
measure. This was selected because it is a marker for
continued distress and need for ongoing clinical care,
and has been an outcome in many previous studies [19].
We chose 6 months as the follow-up period as the ma-
jority of repeat episodes occur within this time-frame
[20]. Our second outcome measure was suicide within
6 months of the self-harm episode. Many studies are in-
sufficiently powered to examine suicide as an outcome,
due to low event numbers, but large observational data-
sets are well suited to this purpose. Individuals who
could not be matched to ONS records (n = 38/3157)
were excluded from the analyses of suicide. Finally, we
were interested to see if there were differences in the
predictive accuracy of the scales by demographic and
clinical sub-groups (age, sex, method of self-harm, self-
harm history and according to the professional back-
ground of the assessor). These have been identified as
factors which may influence the assessment of risk [21].
Missing data
Data were relatively complete (median levels of com-
pleteness for variables 69% (IQR 45% to 92%, range 34%
to 100%) with lower completeness for certain variables
(e.g. future suicidal intent and depression). Data were
more likely to be missing for variables where the individ-
ual did not have a psychosocial assessment. For episodes
where no assessment took place, there was evidence of
bias towards clinicians recording the variable if it was
‘present’ and not if it was ‘absent’. In these instances,
variables were imputed as absent, prior to multiple im-
putation. The potential effect of this would be to under-
estimate sensitivity and overestimate specificity (defined
in Table 1). This included the following items from the
SPS/MSPS: depression or hopelessness, organised or ser-
ious attempt and rational thinking loss. This approach
has been taken in a previous study with similar data [7].
The remaining missing data were largely missing at ran-
dom, with potential predictors of missingness included
in the imputation model. Imputation was conducted
using the ‘chained equations’ approach [22] in Stata to
generate 50 imputations. Analyses were either conducted
on all imputed datasets to generate pooled results, or,
where multiple imputation was not compatible with the
analytic method, estimates were pooled from m = 1–5
using Rubin’s rules [23].
In a sensitivity analysis, repeat self-harm outcomes
were also examined using a dataset with missing data for
scale items coded as not present. This analysis did not
include one of the centres due to the unavailability of a
scale item used in three of the four scales (living circum-
stances) in this centre. We also conducted a ‘complete
case’ analysis of the MSHR and ReACT by excluding
scale items with missing data. Due to the larger number
of items in the SPS and the MSPS, too many cases
would have been excluded for this approach to be feas-
ible for these scales. For example, while 52% of cases
had complete data for at least seven out of ten items on
the SPS, only 2% had complete data for all ten scale
items. Therefore, excluding all cases with missing data
for any one scale item would result in 98% of cases ex-
cluded from the analyses.
Statistical analyses
The predictive accuracy of the scales was examined
using the following measures: sensitivity (the proportion
of people who repeated self-harm and were correctly
identified by the scale as high risk), specificity (the
Steeg et al. BMC Psychiatry  (2018) 18:113 
Page 3 of 11
 proportion of people who did not repeat self-harm and
were correctly identified by the scale as low risk), posi-
tive predictive value (the probability that the person
identified as high risk went on to repeat self-harm),
negative predictive value (the probability that the person
identified as low risk did not repeat self-harm), positive
likelihood ratio (the increased likelihood of a high risk
scale result in a person who repeated self-harm vs. one
who did not), negative likelihood ratio (the decreased
likelihood of a low risk scale result in a person who re-
peated self-harm vs. one who did not) and diagnostic
odds ratio (the odds of a high risk scale result in a per-
son who repeated self-harm vs. one who did not).
Receiver operator characteristic (ROC) curves, which
show sensitivity on the y-axis and 1 minus specificity on
the x-axis for all possible scale thresholds were plotted
[24]. The area under the curve (AUC), based on the
published cut-off points for each scale, was also calcu-
lated. The AUC represents the overall proportion of
cases correctly predicted by the test; an AUC of 0.5
would suggest the test does not perform any better than
chance while an AUC of 1.0 indicates every case is pre-
dicted correctly. Chi-square tests were used to examine
differences in the AUC between subgroups. Stata V.13.1
and OpenEpi were used for the analyses.
Results
Characteristics of the cohort
The 4000 self-harm presentations involved 3157 individ-
uals. 60% (2411) of episodes were by females, 14% (552)
by individuals aged 18 or under and 22% (892) aged
45 years or over. The majority of episodes involved self-
poisoning with drugs or other substances (81%, 3241)
and 19% (759) presentations were by individuals who
had self-injured. 55% (2206) of episodes received a psy-
chosocial assessment. In 2759 (69%) of the episodes,
individuals had a previous history of self-harm. 28%
(1133) of episodes were followed by a repeat episode
within 6 months. Amongst the 3962 episodes in which
individuals could be followed up for mortality status, the
incidence of suicide was 0.5% (n = 18).
Repeat self-harm within six months by scale cut-off
points
For the MSHR and ReACT the majority of the episodes
that were followed by a repeat episode in the subsequent
6 months were identified as moderate to high risk
(Table 2). The MSHR and ReACT both had high sensi-
tivity for identifying repeat self-harm (98% and 94%
respectively) alongside relatively low specificity for iden-
tifying those that did not go on to repeat (15% and 23%
respectively) (Table 3). The reverse pattern was seen for
the SPS and the MSPS: relatively low sensitivity with
high specificity resulted in the correct prediction of the
majority of episodes that were not followed by repetition
of self-harm as low risk. Positive predictive values were
similar across the four scales. The positive likelihood ra-
tios for a high risk result on the scales were between 1.2
(MSHR) and 1.3 (MSPS). The overall area under the
curve (the proportion of episodes correctly identified by
the scales) was highest for the MSHR and ReACT (both
71%) and was approximately equivalent to chance for
the SPS (51%) and the MSPS (49%) (Fig. 1).
Suicide within six months by scale cut-off points
Only two people who died by suicide (11% of all suicides)
were identified as low risk by the MSHR and four (22%)
by ReACT (Table 2). However two thirds of the suicides
(12/18) were categorised as low risk by the SPS and over
80% (15/18) by the MSPS. There were no suicide deaths
identified as high risk by the MSPS (Table 2). The MSHR
and ReACT had relatively high sensitivity for predicting

(AUC). Higher AUC indicate greater discriminatory power.

 suicide, while the SPS and the MSPS had higher specificity
(Table 4).
Differences by subgroups
There were few differences in overall predictive accuracy
(AUC) by subgroups (Table 5). There was higher AUC for
episodes assessed by a psychiatrist for both the SPS
(area under the curve 0.61, p = 0.003) and the MSPS
(0.57, p = 0.001) than those assessed by a mental
health nurse, by another profession or not assessed. The
ReACT risk scale performed worse amongst episodes
involving individuals with no prior episode of self-harm
(0.60) compared to individuals with a history of self-harm
(0.67, p = .0.02). However, the absolute differences be-
tween subgroups were small (Table 5).
Sensitivity analysis
In sensitivity analysis with missing items imputed as not
present, the MSHR and ReACT again performed with
relatively high sensitivity and low specificity, though sen-
sitivities were lower and specificities higher, due to more
individuals being rated as low risk (Additional file 1:
Table S2). The measures of predictive accuracy of the
SPS and MSPS were broadly similar to those in the main
analyses. When we included only those cases with
complete data for all scale items for the MSHR and
ReACT scales, sensitivity was similar but specificity was
lower. For the MSHR, 30.4% (981/3228) of episodes
were followed by repetition of self-harm, sensitivity was
99.2% and specificity was 7.4%. For ReACT, the repeat
rate was 27.2% (668/2459), sensitivity was 94.3% and
specificity was 20.0%.
Discussion
Main findings
The MSHR and ReACT performed with high sensitivity
but low specificity for prediction of repeat self-harm.
This resulted in a large proportion of episodes that were
not followed by repetition being placed in the higher risk
category. The overall area under the curve for these
scales was fair. The SPS and the MSPS had lower sensi-
tivity and higher specificity, resulting in the majority of
episodes that resulted in repetition being identified as
low risk. The SPS and the MSPS were no better than
chance in terms of overall predictive accuracy. The SPS
and the MSPS identified the majority of suicide deaths
as low risk.
Strengths and limitations
Some scale items were not available across all sites. To
avoid over-estimating the prevalence of risk factors, we
assumed the item was not present if data were missing.
Furthermore, if there was evidence that the prevalence
of a scale item was over-estimated in non-assessed epi-
sodes, missing items were imputed as absent for all non-
assessed episodes before multiple imputation. The effect
of this on the measures of predictive accuracy would be
to underestimate sensitivity (due to fewer meeting the
criteria for ‘high risk’) and overestimate specificity (due
to more meeting the criteria for ‘low risk’). When the
performance of the MSHR and the ReACT scales, the
two best performing scales in this study, was tested on
cases with complete data for all scales items, measures
of sensitivity were similar and specificities were lower.
This suggests our imputation approach did not lead to
over-estimation of the performance of these two scales.
The data for this study were obtained from observa-
tional self-harm cohorts with data extracted from hos-
pital records and clinical notes. It was necessary to use
proxy variables for certain scale items where an exact
corresponding variable was not available, which is a limi-
tation of this study. In addition, for some scale items,
corresponding variables could be recorded differently ac-
cording to the study centre. For example, suicidal intent
was derived from the Suicide Intent Scale in three cen-
tres and from a binary variable in another centre. This
would have had most impact on the SAD PERSONS
Scales, due to the higher number of scale items. How-
ever, the measures of diagnostic accuracy are in line with
a previous study which showed the area under the curve
to be no better than chance for the SPS [17]. Further-
more, this novel approach resulted in a more representa-
tive, real-world sample of self-harm episodes and their
management.
A potential source of bias in this study could have
arisen if percieved risk influenced subsequent clinical

 with risks of repeat self-harm and suicide. This would
have led to bias in the measures of predictive accuracy.
Comparison to previous research
A previous study used a selected sample with clinicians
administering the risk scales following referral to psychi-
atric services [12]. The conclusion from that study was
that the diagnostic accuracy of the scales was too modest
for them to be of clinical use. The measures of diagnos-
tic accuracy in the present study are comparable, sug-
gesting that risk scales following self-harm are also
unsuitable for the wider population of all those who
present to hospital following self-harm, not just those
seen by mental health clinicians. While the previous
study recruited patients after they had been referred to
liaison psychiatry for assessment, the present study also
included non-referred episodes, typically just under half
of all episodes [13, 25]. The present study also suggests
that the risk scales are unsuitable for predicting risk of
future suicide among individuals presenting with self-
harm. A meta-analysis of risk scales used for predicting
suicidal behaviour also found that predictive ability of
risk scales was insufficient to be used to determine treat-
ment allocation [10]. The present study addresses the
high level of heterogeneity found in the meta-analysis,
and reaches similar conclusions.
A comparatively small study of psychiatric inpatients
recently reported a modular multi-informant approach,
resulting in promising levels of accuracy for predicting
further suicidal behaviour [26]. Machine learning tech-
niques utilising medical databases are also becoming
more common in the pursuit of accurate detection of
suicide risk [27]. These are potential areas for further
research.
Clinical implications
This study adds to the evidence that scales, particularly
the widely used SAD PERSONS Scales, are not suitable
for predicting repeat episodes of self-harm or future sui-
cide. Their overall performance as measured by the
AUC did not surpass a ‘fair’ level of prediction, defined
as between 0.7 and 0.8 [28], likelihood ratios had weak
predictive ability [29] and performance did not exceed
that of clinicians’ ratings (measured at 0.74) found in an
earlier study [12].
There is evidence that risk classification scales remain
in widespread use despite growing evidence about their
poor predictive abilities [8, 10]. It is possible that clini-
cians welcome the structure they offer or the prompts
for factors to consider, such as social isolation, in their
overall formulation of a follow-up plan. The use of risk
scales may act as ‘aide memoires’ for less experienced
clinicians and may help in eliciting the relevant informa-
tion, provided the patient’s narrative is not lost [30].
Carter and colleagues also suggest that there should be a
focus on modifiable risk factors, such as hopelessness, as
part of a needs-based assessment [10]. This would help
focus the assessment on a person’s situation and how
best to help manage it [31]. There is evidence that as-
sessment itself may be beneficial at reducing the risk of
a repeat self-harm episode [6, 7], with patients valuing a
positive therapeutic alliance that promotes hope and en-
couragement [32].

 The SPS and MSPS performed slightly better for
episodes assessed by a psychiatrist, though the per-
formance was still below those of the ReACT and
MSHR scales. Episodes assessed by a psychiatrist were
more likely to involve individuals with a history of
self-harm but not currently receiving treatment. The
episodes by individuals assessed by psychiatrists were
also more likely to be rated as moderate or high risk
than low risk on both the SPS and the MSPS com-
pared to episodes assessed by mental health nurses.
In addition, the overall predictive accuracy of the
ReACT scale was lower for episodes where individuals
had no history of self-harm. These individuals were
less likely to repeat self-harm, and the specificity was
lower (16%), suggesting the incorrect identification of
episodes that did not repeat resulted in reduced over-
all performance. However, the difference in predictive
accuracy between these groups was small and is un-
likely to be of major clinical importance.
Conclusion
The findings of this study support existing clinical
guidance, which suggests scales that classify patients
into risk categories should not be used alone to allo-
cate treatment or predict future risk of further self-
harm or suicide. There was no evidence to support
the use of risk scales with particular subgroups of pa-
tients. While scales with high sensitivity may have
some clinical use when considered alongside a com-
prehensive assessment [15], they are not suitable for
the purpose of prediction. Given that scales continue
to be widely used by clinicians, future studies could
consider if they could be combined with other ap-
proaches to increase their effectiveness. For example,
randomised controlled trials could combine structured
risk assessment with other aspects of care, such as
comprehensive follow-up planning or building thera-
peutic alliance. A study carried out recently in the
United States found that screening in the ED com-
bined with a brief intervention consisting of a number
of components (including safety planning and follow-
up telephone calls), was associated with reductions in
repeat suicide attempts and overall number of repeat
attempts [33]. Further studies of this kind could help
to determine aspects of risk scales that might be use-
ful in the management of self-harm.
