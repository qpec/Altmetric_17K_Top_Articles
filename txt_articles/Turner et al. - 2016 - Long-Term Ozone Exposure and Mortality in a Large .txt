Abstract
Rationale: Tropospheric ozone (O3) is potentially associated with
cardiovascular disease risk and premature death. Results from long-
term epidemiological studies on O3 are scarce and inconclusive.
Objectives:Inthisstudy,weexaminedassociationsbetweenchronic
ambient O3 exposure and all-cause and cause-specific mortality in
a large cohort of U.S. adults.
Methods: Cancer Prevention Study II participants were enrolled in
1982. A total of 669,046 participants were analyzed, among whom
237,201 deaths occurred through 2004. We obtained estimates of
O3 concentrations at the participant’s residence from a hierarchical
Bayesian space–time model. Estimates of fine particulate matter
(particulate matter with an aerodynamic diameter of up to 2.5 mm
[PM2.5]) and NO2 concentrations were obtained from land use
regression. Cox proportional hazards regression models were used to
examine mortality associations adjusted for individual- and
ecological-level covariates.
Measurements and Main Results: In single-pollutant models,
we observed significant positive associations between O3, PM2.5,
and NO2 concentrations and all-cause and cause-specific mortality.
In two-pollutant models adjusted for PM2.5, significant positive
associations remained between O3 and all-cause (hazard ratio
[HR] per 10 ppb, 1.02; 95% confidence interval [CI], 1.01–1.04),
circulatory (HR, 1.03; 95% CI, 1.01–1.05), and respiratory
mortality (HR, 1.12; 95% CI, 1.08–1.16) that were unchanged with
further adjustment for NO2. We also observed positive mortality
associations with both PM2.5 (both near source and regional) and
NO2 in multipollutant models.
Conclusions: Findings derived from this large-scale
prospective study suggest that long-term ambient O3 contributes
to risk of respiratory and circulatory mortality. Substantial
health and environmental benefits may be achieved by
implementing further measures aimed at controlling O3
concentrations.

 Epidemiological studies investigating short-
term exposures (ranging from hours to
a few days) to ambient ozone (O3) showed
positive associations with mortality,
exacerbation of respiratory illness, and
increased hospital admissions (1). There
is suggestive evidence that short-term O3
is associated with adverse cardiovascular
effects (2–4). Epidemiological studies of
long-term O3 exposure are scarce, and
the causal nature of associations uncertain
(4, 5).
A prior study based on 18 years
of follow-up of 448,850 participants,
including 118,777 deaths, in the American
Cancer Society Cancer Prevention Study-II
(CPS-II) showed significant positive
associations between long-term
(1977–2000) O3 from available urban
government monitors and both respiratory
and cardiovascular mortality in single-
pollutant models (6). In models adjusted
for fine particulate matter (particulate
matter with an aerodynamic diameter of up
to 2.5 mm [PM2.5]), only the association
with respiratory mortality remained
(hazard ratio [HR] per 10 ppb, 1.04; 95%
confidence interval [CI], 1.01–1.07). There
was a moderately high correlation between
the two pollutants (r = 0.64).
The California Teachers Study showed
positive associations between year-round
O3 concentrations and mortality due to
respiratory causes (HR per interquartile
range [11.02 ppb], 1.07; 95% CI, 0.97–1.19)
and ischemic heart disease (IHD) (HR per
11.02 ppb, 1.06; 95% CI, 0.99–1.14) (7). In
two-pollutant models, the association with
IHD was confounded by PM2.5. No positive
mortality associations were observed in
a U.K. patient cohort (8).
There was a positive association between
long-term (2001–2008) county-level O3
concentrations and chronic lower respiratory
disease mortality in a U.S. ecological study
(9). Positive associations were observed with
cardiometabolic but not respiratory
mortality in multipollutant models adjusted
for PM2.5 and NO2 in the Canadian
CanCHEC study (10). There were no data
on potential individual-level behavioral
confounding factors, including cigarette
smoking, in either study.
The worldwide mean 3-month hourly
maximum O3 concentration in 2005 was
54 ppb (11), and it is increasing in densely
populated areas of South Asia and East Asia
due largely to growing O3 precursor
emissions (9). O3 contributes to increased
radiative forcing and climate change (12, 13).
On the basis of findings from the
previous CPS-II study, more than 217,000
deaths caused by chronic obstructive
pulmonary disease (COPD) worldwide were
attributed to long-term O3 exposure in 2013
(6, 14). Further evidence for long-term O3
effects would markedly increase the
attributable disease burden. Recent
advancements in O3 exposure assessment
integrating air quality data from
government monitors with estimates from
photochemical models across the United
States afford a unique opportunity to
further examine O3 effects in larger
national-level studies.
We assessed associations between long-
term ambient O3 exposure and all-cause
and cause-specific mortality in an extended
analysis of the CPS-II study using new
national-level estimates of ambient O3,
PM2.5, and NO2 concentrations. The
increased number of included participants
and extended follow-up period (from 1982
to 2004) resulted in nearly double the
number of deaths investigated previously
(6). Research designed to disentangle the
independent effects of such ambient air
pollutants is a key research priority (5).
Some results were previously reported in
the form of an abstract (15).
Methods
Study Population
CPS-II is a prospective study of nearly
1.2 million participants enrolled in all
50 U.S. states, the District of Columbia, and
Puerto Rico by 77,000 volunteers in 1982.
Participants were largely friends and family
members of volunteers, at least 30 years of
age, and had a family member aged 45 years
or older. A four-page, self-administered
enrollment questionnaire was used to
capture data on demographic, lifestyle,
medical, and other factors (16). Ethical
approval for CPS-II was obtained from the
Emory University School of Medicine
Human Investigations Committee.
In 1984, 1986, and 1988, vital status was
ascertained by study volunteers and
confirmed by corresponding death
certificates. After 1989, computerized
linkage to the National Death Index was
used (17). Through 2004, 743,543 (62.8%)
participants were alive, 438,123 (37.0%)
had died, and 2,921 (0.2%) were lost to
follow-up or had follow-up terminated in
September 1988 due to insufficient record
linkage information. Deaths were classified
by underlying cause using the International
Classification of Diseases, 9th and 10th
revisions (18, 19). More than 99% of
known deaths were assigned a cause.
A total of 669,046 participants were
analyzed (see Figure E1 in the online
supplement). The majority of exclusions
were due to missing or invalid residence
(n = 385,422) (20) or covariate (n = 130,119)
data (Table E1). The study cohort
included 237,201 deaths in 12,662,562
person-years of follow-up.
Estimates of Ambient Air Pollution
Concentrations
Estimated O3 concentrations were
obtained from the hierarchical Bayesian
space–time model (HBM) of the U.S.
Environmental Protection Agency and
Centers for Disease Control and
Prevention Environmental Public Health
Tracking Network (Figure 1) (21). The
HBM combines ambient measurement

At a Glance Commentary
Scientific Knowledge on the
Subject: Tropospheric ozone
(O3) might be associated with
cardiovascular disease risk and
premature death. Results from long-
term epidemiological studies on O3 are
scarce and inconclusive.
What This Study Adds to the
Field: In this study, we examined the
association between chronic ambient
O3 exposure and all-cause and cause-
specific mortality in an extended
analysis of the Cancer Prevention
Study II, using new national-level
estimates of ambient O3, fine
particulate matter (particulate matter
with an aerodynamic diameter of up
to 2.5 mm [PM2.5]), and NO2
concentrations. Results from this
large-scale prospective study suggest
that long-term ambient O3 contributes
to risk of respiratory and circulatory
mortality. There were also positive
mortality associations observed with
PM2.5 (both near source and regional)
and NO2 in multipollutant models.

 Stations with gridded estimates from the
Models-3/Community Multiscale Air
Quality (CMAQ) photochemical model
to obtain daily 8-hour maximum O3
concentrations in 36 3 36-km grids for
the entire United States for the years
2001–2006. To coincide with our cohort
follow-up, we examined both mean annual
and summertime (April–September)
estimates for the years 2002–2004; year
2001 estimates were omitted due to
differences in model input meteorological
parameters. Mean O3 (2002–2004)
values were assigned to the geocoded
participant residence at enrollment and
used as an indicator of long-term O3
exposure.
We also examined O3 concentrations
derived from a Bayesian space–time
downscaling fusion model (henceforth
termed “Downscaler O3”) (22). Daily
8-hour maximum O3 concentrations at
the census tract centroid were estimated
on the basis of National Air Monitoring
Stations/State and Local Air Monitoring
Stations and CMAQ model data in
12 3 12-km grids for the years 2001–2008.
Downscaler O3 estimates consider all
monitors, as opposed to the most prevalent
monitor, where there are multiple monitors
per site. We assigned mean monthly daily
estimates to 545,302 CPS-II participants, as
data were available only for the eastern
United States for 2002–2004. Model
performance using the predictive mean
absolute error showed that Downscaler O3
outperformed ordinary kriging or CMAQ
models alone, with a predictive mean
absolute error of 5 based on the square root
of daily O3 values (23). Correlations with
holdout locations for daily predictions
ranged from 0.61 to 0.86 at three sites in the
eastern United States.
Estimated PM2.5 concentrations were
obtained using a national-level hybrid land
use regression (LUR) and Bayesian
maximum entropy (BME) interpolation
model (Figure E2) (24). Monthly PM2.5
monitoring data were collected from 1,464
sites from 1999 through 2008, with 10%
reserved for cross-validation. The base LUR
model that predicted PM2.5 concentrations
included traffic within 1 km and
green space within 100 m3. Residual
spatiotemporal variation in PM2.5
concentrations was interpolated with
a BME interpolation model. The two
estimates were then combined. The cross-
validation R2 was approximately 0.79.
Mean PM2.5 (1999–2004) concentrations
were used here. To address potential
confounding of O3–mortality associations
by PM2.5, estimates of PM2.5 were
decomposed a priori into near-source
(LUR) and regional (LURBME-LUR)
components to more accurately account for
differences in correlation structure with O3
(Tables E2 and E3). Results for the overall
LURBME PM2.5 are presented in Table E4
and elsewhere for selected mortality
endpoints (20, 25). HBM PM2.5 data were
also examined (above) (26).
NO2 concentrations were based on
a national LUR model using regulatory
monitoring (hourly data from 423
monitors) and satellite-based measurements
(approximately 4 million measurements,
aggregated into annual average values at
81,743 locations [approximately 10 3 10-km
grids]) at the census block group level for the
year 2006 (27). Additional independent
variables included population; satellite-based
classification of land uses, impervious
surfaces, tree coverage, and distance to
roadways (model R2 = 0.78).
Statistical Analysis
We used Cox proportional hazards
regression models to examine associations
between mean O3 (2002–2004),
PM2.5 (1999–2004), and NO2 (2006)
concentrations and all-cause and cause-
specific mortality. Models were stratified
by 1-year age categories, sex, and race
(white, African American, or other).
Follow-up time in days since enrollment
was used as the time axis. The survival
times of those alive at the end of follow-
up were censored.
Models were adjusted a priori for
the following covariates assessed at
enrollment as in previous work (6, 20, 25,
28–30): education; marital status; body mass
index (BMI) and BMI squared; cigarette
smoking status; cigarettes per day and
cigarettes per day squared; years smoked and
years smoked squared; started smoking at
younger than 18 years of age; passive smoking
(hours); vegetable, fruit, fiber, and fat
intake; beer, wine, and liquor consumption;
occupational exposures; an occupational
dirtiness index; and six sociodemographic
ecological covariates at both the postal code
and postal code minus county-level mean
derived from the 1990 U.S. Census
(median household income and percentage
of African American residents, Hispanic
residents, adults with postsecondary
education, unemployment, and poverty)
(Table E5).
We examined potential confounding by
elevation, metropolitan statistical area size,
annual average daily maximum air
temperature, and 1980 percentage of air
conditioning (and mean county-level
residential radon concentrations for
respiratory and lung cancer mortality only)

 (6, 29, 31–34). We also used a proportional
hazards model with a random effect for
county of residence at enrollment. An
interaction term between O3 and follow-up
time was used to assess the proportional
hazards assumption.
Threshold models, defined by setting
the O3 concentration to 0 below the
threshold and the concentration minus the
threshold value otherwise, were examined
at 1-ppb increments across the entire
exposure range. Potential modification of
O3 associations by age at enrollment, sex,
education, BMI, cigarette-smoking status,
passive smoking, prior cardiovascular
disease (high blood pressure, heart
disease, stroke, or diabetes) or respiratory
disease (asthma, emphysema, or chronic
bronchitis) at enrollment, and temperature
was assessed using multiplicative interaction
terms. Two-sided P values based on the
likelihood ratio statistic were calculated
to assess their significance.
For analyses, we used SAS version 9.2
software (SAS Institute, Cary, NC) and
specialized software developed for the
random effects survival model (30, 35).
Ethical approval for our present analysis
was obtained from the Ottawa Hospital
Research Ethics Board.
Results
Participants were largely between the ages of
40 and 69 years, female, and had more than
a high school education (Table 1). There
was little variation in O3 concentrations by
participant characteristics.
Year-round O3 concentrations ranged
from 26.7 to 59.3 ppb, with a mean (SD) of
38.2 (4.0) ppb (Table E2). For PM2.5 and
NO2, average concentrations ranged from
1.4 to 27.9 mg/m3 (mean [SD], 12.6 [2.9]
mg/m3) and 1.0 to 37.6 ppb (mean [SD],
11.6 [5.1] ppb), respectively. Correlations

 near-source and regional PM2.5 were weak
(Pearson’s r = 20.13 and 10.23,
respectively) (Table E3).
In single-pollutant models, significant
positive associations were present between
year-round O3 and all-cause (HR per 10 ppb,
1.02; 95% CI, 1.01–1.04), circulatory
(HR per 10 ppb, 1.03; 95% CI, 1.02–1.05),
and respiratory (HR per 10 ppb, 1.14;
95% CI, 1.10–1.18) mortality (Table E6).
Significant positive associations were
observed for both regional PM2.5, ranging
up to HR per 10 mg/m3 of 1.16 (95% CI,
1.10–1.23) for respiratory mortality, and
near-source PM2.5, ranging up to HR per
10 mg/m3 of 1.45 (95% CI, 1.35–1.57) for
circulatory mortality. There were significant
positive associations between NO2 and
all-cause (HR per 10 ppb, 1.04; 95% CI,
1.03–1.06) and circulatory (HR per 10 ppb,
1.08; 95% CI, 1.06–1.09) mortality but not
respiratory mortality.
In two-pollutant models adjusted for
PM2.5, significant positive associations
between O3 and all-cause (HR per 10 ppb,
1.02; 95% CI, 1.01–1.04), circulatory
(HR per 10 ppb, 1.03; 95% CI, 1.01–1.05),
and respiratory (HR per 10 ppb, 1.12; 95%
CI, 1.08–1.16) mortality were observed
(Table E7). Results were unchanged with
further adjustment for NO2 (Table 2).
The strongest O3 association was noted for
diabetes mortality specifically (HR, 1.16;
95% CI, 1.07–1.26), followed by mortality
due to dysrhythmias, heart failure, and
cardiac arrest; COPD; and pneumonia and
influenza. Significant positive mortality
associations also remained for both
regional and near-source PM2.5 in the
multipollutant model. For NO2, the
association with circulatory mortality
attenuated (HR per 10 ppb, 1.03; 95% CI,
1.01–1.05) and that with all-cause mortality
was not apparent.
Results for O3 strengthened slightly for
respiratory mortality with adjustment for
percentage with air conditioning (Table
E8). Results were slightly attenuated for
both for circulatory (HR, 1.03; 95% CI,
1.00–1.05) and respiratory (HR, 1.11; 95%
CI, 1.06–1.16) mortality with inclusion of
a county-level random effect.
Similar results were observed using
summer O3 concentrations, except for
mortality due to dysrhythmias, heart
failure, and cardiac arrest; diabetes; and
respiratory causes. The latter results were
attenuated (Table E9). Results were similar
for O3 when adjusted for HBM PM2.5
compared with decomposed LURBME
PM2.5 concentrations (Table E10). Results
were slightly stronger using estimated
Downscaler O3 concentrations (HR per
10 ppb, 1.05; 95% CI, 1.03–1.07 [all-cause
mortality]; HR per 10 ppb, 1.06; 95% CI,
1.03–1.09 [circulatory mortality]; HR per
10 ppb, 1.14; 95% CI, 1.07–1.21 [respiratory
mortality]), due largely to the subsample of
included participants (Tables E2, E3, and
E11).
The proportional hazards assumption
was violated (P , 0.05) for associations
between O3 and all-cause, circulatory,
cardiovascular, and IHD mortality, with
positive associations (except null results for
IHD) observed in the middle 1990–1999
and later 2000–2004 time periods only,
although the magnitude of the differences
was small (Table E12). There was some

 suggestive of a threshold for circulatory
mortality at 35 ppb (P = 0.07).
O3 circulatory and respiratory mortality
associations varied according to temperature
and prior cardiovascular or respiratory
disease at enrollment, respectively (Table
E13). Positive respiratory associations were
also stronger in those younger than 65 years
of age at enrollment.
For comparability across pollutants,
results according to each fifth percentile–mean
increment are presented in Table 3. Results
were somewhat stronger with near-source
PM2.5 for both all-cause (HR per 1.6 mg/m3,
1.04; 95% CI, 1.03–1.05) and circulatory (HR
per 1.6 mg/m3, 1.06; 95% CI, 1.04–1.07)
mortality and with O3 for respiratory mortality
(HR per 7.1 ppb, 1.08; 95% CI, 1.05–1.11).
Discussion
We observed significant positive
associations between long-term O3 and
all-cause, circulatory, and respiratory
mortality with 2%, 3%, and 12% increases
in risk per 10 ppb, respectively, in this
large-scale study with 22 years of follow-
up. In a smaller prior study, researchers
first reported long-term O3–mortality
associations, but only that for respiratory
mortality remained with adjustment for
PM2.5 (6). We hypothesized that with
improved exposure models and increased
statistical power derived from longer
follow-up, robust associations between
O3 and both respiratory and circulatory
mortality would be observed with
adjustment for other copollutants. Results
supporting our hypothesis were robust
after adjustment for PM2.5 and NO2.
We used new national-level O3
exposure estimates extending our earlier
work based on measured regional levels
of air pollutants. Although there were also
differences in the time period (2002–2004
vs. 1977–2000) and season (year-round vs.
summertime) of O3 metrics used in the
present study versus the previous study,
their correlation was moderately
strong (r = 0.70) (6). Analysis linking
the current HBM O3 estimate to the
previous analytic cohort showed stronger
respiratory mortality HRs of 1.16 (95% CI,
1.09–1.24) per 10 ppb and 1.11 (95% CI,
1.06–1.17) per each fifth percentile–mean
increment in two-pollutant models
adjusted for PM2.5 (6). In comparison,
HRs of 1.04 (95% CI, 1.01–1.07) per 10
ppb and 1.07 (95% CI, 1.02–1.12) per each
fifth percentile–mean increment were
observed using measured O3 data in
previous work, indicating larger associations
with more refined O3 estimates (6).
Our findings support previous
associations with respiratory mortality in
U.S. studies (6, 7). Possible biological
mechanisms include oxidative stress and
inflammatory pathways as well as adverse
neural, epithelial, smooth muscle, and
immune system impacts (4). In contrast,
no positive association was observed in
a large (n = 800,000) U.K. patient cohort
(8). There O3 was negatively correlated
with PM2.5 (r = 20.39), and regional
patterns in O3 and mortality may explain
the findings observed. There was no
positive association with respiratory
mortality in the CanCHEC study (10).
We observed a positive association with
circulatory mortality that remained after
adjustment for PM2.5 and NO2. Results from
some previous studies were confounded by
PM2.5 (6, 7). The researchers in the prior
U.K. study reported no positive association
with incident myocardial infarction, stroke,
arrhythmia, or heart failure (36). Analysis of

 California CPS-II participants revealed
a positive association with IHD mortality
(HR per interquartile range [24.2 ppb], 1.10;
95% CI, 1.02–1.19), which remained after
adjusting for PM2.5 and NO2 (29). Although
we observed no association with IHD
mortality here, upon restriction to California
participants there was a weak positive
association (HR per 10 ppb, 1.07; 95% CI,
0.99–1.14). Regional differences in these
findings may relate to participant
characteristics, death rates, death certificate
coding, or air pollution composition.
Positive associations with cardiometabolic
disease mortality were observed in
multipollutant models in the CanCHEC
study, with the strongest findings being for
diabetes (11% increase per 9.5 ppb) and IHD
(6% increase) using a 21 3 21-km grid
surface (10).
Findings for respiratory mortality were
stronger among those with no prior
respiratory disease at enrollment, suggesting
a role for O3 in the development and
exacerbation of disease. In a previous
Medicare-based study, researchers reported
positive associations between long-term O3
and mortality in those previously hospitalized
for COPD, as well as in those with diabetes,
congestive heart failure, or myocardial
infarction (37). Findings were also stronger in
younger participants. Little age difference was
observed in short-term studies (38).
Stronger associations were observed in
areas with lower temperature as well as in
the highest temperature category. The
relationship between ambient and personal
O3 exposure is complex, weaker than with
particles, and varies with time spent
outdoors, indoor infiltration, and season
(39). Time spent outdoors and engaged in
sports may modify associations for asthma
formation (40). Differences in short-term
O3 mortality coefficients across 18 U.S.
cities were related to differences in total O3
(outdoor plus indoor) exposure (41).
Mitigation of short-term O3-related
mortality by air conditioning prevalence
was observed at high temperatures in 97
U.S. cities (42). Though results suggest
a threshold for respiratory and, to a lesser
extent, circulatory mortality at 35 ppb of O3
compared with that of 56 ppb (P = 0.06) in
previous work (6), it remains unclear if the
results represent a biological threshold
per se or other such temperature-related,
behavioral, or region-related processes.
There were no data on time–activity
patterns here.
We observed positive mortality
associations with estimated LURBME PM2.5
concentrations (30). The LURBME PM2.5
model outperformed other remote sensing,
geostatistical, and HBM models in CPS-II
(25). Results were somewhat stronger
with regional PM2.5 for respiratory
mortality and near-source PM2.5 for
circulatory mortality.
Correlations between O3 and PM2.5
were weak. Though air pollutants were
estimated at different time periods using
different methods and geographic units of
scale, possibly complicating interpretation
of their correlation structure, results for O3
were robust in two-pollutant models
adjusted for HBM PM2.5 and estimated for
the same time period and unit of scale.
Their correlation was also weak (r = 0.04)
(Tables E3 and E10). Results for O3
were similar using Downscaler O3
concentrations, estimated with a finer
spatial resolution (12 3 12 km) (Table
E11), compared with HBM O3. The
correlation between HBM and Downscaler
O3 was strong (r = 0.89) (Table E3).
We adjusted findings for decomposed
LURBME PM2.5 and NO2 to address
potential confounding in areas with low
O3 but high near-source pollution (43).
Negative correlations between Downscaler
O3 and both near-source PM2.5 and NO2
(r = 20.41 and 20.42, respectively)
were stronger than those for HBM O3
(r = 20.13 and 20.08, respectively).
Downscaler HRs for all-cause and
circulatory mortality also increased to
a greater extent in multipollutant models
compared with those for HBM O3
(Tables E3, E6, and E11).
Positive associations between NO2
and circulatory mortality were attenuated
with adjustment for PM2.5 and O3. The
association with all-cause mortality was
no longer apparent. Currently, there is
suggestive evidence for NO2-associated
cardiovascular effects but uncertainty
regarding its independent role (5, 44, 45).
Results in two European studies
revealed small positive associations with
nonaccidental mortality that remained in
two-pollutant models with PM2.5 (46, 47).
There were also small positive mortality
associations in multipollutant models with
both PM2.5 and O3 in two North American
studies (10, 29). Williams and colleagues
(43) noted close linkages between NO2 and
O3. Correlations between NO2 and HBM
O3 (r = 20.08) were weak, possibly due to
different units of scale and broad regional
patterns of pollutants.
Limitations of this study include a lack
of updated data on residential history,
leading to potential misclassification of both
air pollution concentrations and
sociodemographic ecologic covariates over
time, as well as of individual covariate data.
There were no data on residential history
before enrollment. Accounting for
residential mobility, however, had little
impact on long-term O3 or PM2.5 mortality
associations in the CanCHEC study but
strengthened those for more spatially
resolved NO2 (10). Though there may be
some selection bias due to the exclusion of
participants with missing or invalid
residence data, excluded participants were
similar in terms of baseline sociodemographic
factors (approximately 61% between 50 and
69 years of age, approximately 57% female,
approximately 47% with more than high
school level of education, and approximately
21% current cigarette smokers). Though we
lacked historical O3 data, there was little
difference in respiratory mortality HRs in
previous work when researchers examined
specific exposure time windows or O3
exposures matched more closely in time (5).
Recent O3 concentrations are correlated with
past estimates. Correlations between
1998–2000 concentrations and those from
1988–1990 and 1978–1980 were 0.80 and
0.58, respectively (6). Little is known regarding
the most relevant exposure time window.
Finally, multiple comparisons were performed,
and some results may be due to chance.
In summary, findings derived from this
large-scale prospective study suggest that
long-term ambient O3 contributes to risk of
respiratory and circulatory mortality.
Results were robust after adjustment for
PM2.5 and NO2. There were also positive
mortality associations observed between
PM2.5 (both near source and regional) and
NO2 in multipollutant models. Substantial
health and environmental benefits may be
achieved by implementing further measures
aimed at controlling O3 concentrations. n
