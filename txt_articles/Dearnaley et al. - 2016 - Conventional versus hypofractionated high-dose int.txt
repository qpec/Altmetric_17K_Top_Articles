Summary
Background Prostate cancer might have high radiation-fraction sensitivity that would give a therapeutic advantage to 
hypofractionated treatment. We present a pre-planned analysis of the effi
  cacy and side-eff
 ects of a randomised trial 
comparing conventional and hypofractionated radiotherapy after 5 years follow-up.
Methods CHHiP is a randomised, phase 3, non-inferiority trial that recruited men with localised prostate cancer 
(pT1b–T3aN0M0). Patients were randomly assigned (1:1:1) to conventional (74 Gy delivered in 37 fractions over 
7·4 weeks) or one of two hypofractionated schedules (60 Gy in 20 fractions over 4 weeks or 57 Gy in 19 fractions over 
3·8 weeks) all delivered with intensity-modulated techniques. Most patients were given radiotherapy with 3–6 months 
of neoadjuvant and concurrent androgen suppression. Randomisation was by computer-generated random permuted 
blocks, stratifi
 ed by National Comprehensive Cancer Network (NCCN) risk group and radiotherapy treatment centre, 
and treatment allocation was not masked. The primary endpoint was time to biochemical or clinical failure; the 
critical hazard ratio (HR) for non-inferiority was 1·208. Analysis was by intention to treat. Long-term follow-up 
continues. The CHHiP trial is registered as an International Standard Randomised Controlled Trial, number 
ISRCTN97182923.
Findings Between Oct 18, 2002, and June 17, 2011, 3216 men were enrolled from 71 centres and randomly assigned 
(74 Gy group, 1065 patients; 60 Gy group, 1074 patients; 57 Gy group, 1077 patients). Median follow-up was 
62·4 months (IQR 53·9–77·0). The proportion of patients who were biochemical or clinical failure free at 5 years was 
88·3% (95% CI 86·0–90·2) in the 74 Gy group, 90·6% (88·5–92·3) in the 60 Gy group, and 85·9% (83·4–88·0) in the 
57 Gy group. 60 Gy was non-inferior to 74 Gy (HR 0·84 [90% CI 0·68–1·03], pNI=0·0018) but non-inferiority could not 
be claimed for 57 Gy compared with 74 Gy (HR 1·20 [0·99–1·46], pNI=0·48). Long-term side-eff
 ects were similar in 
the hypofractionated groups compared with the conventional group. There were no signifi
 cant diff
 erences in either 
the proportion or cumulative incidence of side-eff
 ects 5 years after treatment using three clinician-reported as well as 
patient-reported outcome measures. The estimated cumulative 5 year incidence of Radiation Therapy Oncology 
Group (RTOG) grade 2 or worse bowel and bladder adverse events was 13·7% (111 events) and 9·1% (66 events) in the 
74 Gy group, 11·9% (105 events) and 11·7% (88 events) in the 60 Gy group, 11·3% (95 events) and 6·6% (57 events) 
in the 57 Gy group, respectively. No treatment-related deaths were reported.
Interpretation Hypofractionated radiotherapy using 60 Gy in 20 fractions is non-inferior to conventional fractionation 
using 74 Gy in 37 fractions and is recommended as a new standard of care for external-beam radiotherapy of localised 
prostate cancer.

Introduction
Prostate cancer is the most common cancer in men in the 
UK, with 41 736 new cases in 2011.1 Since the introduction 
of prostate-specifi
 c antigen (PSA) testing, most men 
diagnosed have localised disease. Management options 
include external-beam radiotherapy, brachytherapy, radical 
prostatectomy, active surveillance (for men with low-risk 
disease), and watchful waiting (for those unsuitable for 
radical curative treatment), with management choices 
often aff
 ected by potential treat 
ment-related toxic eff
 ects. 
Prostate cancer and its treatment are the leading cause of 
cancer years lived with disability.2

External-beam radiotherapy is most appropriate for 
men with intermediate-risk or high-risk disease,3 and is 
associated with long-term disease control in most 
patients.4 About 15 800 men receive radical prostate 
radiotherapy in the UK every year (Ball C, National 
Clinical Analysis and Specialised Applications Team, The 
Clatterbridge Cancer Centre NHS Foundation Trust, 
personal communication). Several phase 3 randomised 
controlled trials have shown the benefi
 t of dose 
escalation5,6 and high-dose conformal radiotherapy with 
conventional 2 Gy daily fractions to a total dose of 74 Gy 
is the standard of care in the UK.7 However, a 
meta-analysis showed that high-dose radiotherapy 
(74–80 Gy) is associated with an increased risk (odds ratio 
1·58) of late gastrointestinal toxicity of grade 2 or more 
compared with lower doses of radiotherapy (64–70·2 Gy).8 
Therefore, it is important to use advanced radiotherapy 
techniques that are able to sculpt dose distributions to 
the prostate target and avoid the organs at risk.
Additionally, there has been interest in the fraction 
sensitivity of prostate cancer.9–11 The association between 
total isoeff
 ective radiation dose and fraction size is 
described by a linear quadratic model which uses two 
constants: α and β. The ratio α/β is inversely related to 
the eff
 ect of changes in fraction size on normal and 
malignant tissues. The α/β ratio for most cancers 
and acute normal tissue reactions is believed to be high 
and about 10 Gy. However, for prostate cancer, a value as 
low as 1·5 Gy has been suggested, which is lower than 
the 3 Gy reported for the late reactions of most normal 
tissues (including rectum).12 These fi
 ndings have 
potentially important therapeutic implications. Hypo-
fractionated radiotherapy, giving fewer fractions each 
with a higher dose, might improve the therapeutic ratio, 
resource use, and patient convenience.
The main aims of the CHHiP trial (CRUK/06/016) 
were to compare the effi
  cacy and toxicity of conventional 
and hypofractionated radiotherapy using high-quality 
radiation techniques.
Methods
Study design and participants
CHHiP is an international, multicentre, randomised, 
phase 3, non-inferiority trial comparing the con-
ventionally fractionated schedule of 74 Gy in 37 fractions 
with two experimental hypofractionated schedules of 
60 Gy in 20 fractions and 57 Gy in 19 fractions in men 
with localised prostate cancer. Safety of the 3 Gy (fraction) 
schedules was reported after a pre-planned analysis of 
the fi
 rst 457 men recruited.13 Here, we report primary 
effi
  cacy results and further comparative safety data.
Men older than 16 years who had histologically 
confi
 rmed T1b–T3aN0M0 prostate cancer and a WHO 
performance status of 0 or 1 were eligible. Initially, men 
with a PSA concentration of less than 40 ng/mL and risk 
of lymph node involvement14 less than 30% were eligible. 
 
Research in context
Evidence before this study
We searched PubMed for articles published between Jan 1, 1990, 
and Oct 18, 2002, before trial commencement using the terms 
“radiotherapy AND prostate cancer AND (hypofractionation OR 
alpha/beta ratio)” and then updated results to Sept 8, 2015. 
Before the CHHiP trial began, reports based on retrospective 
series of patients suggested that the α/β ratio for prostate 
cancer might be low, but only two small randomised trials had 
tested hypofractionation compared with conventional 
fractionation, both using relatively low doses of radiotherapy, 
and neither trial was large enough to confirm or refute a benefit. 
Since CHHiP started, more recent results from a meta-analysis of 
fi
 ve small trials testing hypofractionation and retrospective 
reviews of large patient databases have been done, suggesting 
that the best estimates for the α/β ratio are between 1·4 Gy and 
1·9 Gy, although estimates up to 8·3 Gy have been calculated. 
However, these retrospective analyses and reviews have not 
changed clinical practice; hence the need for a large randomised 
controlled trial. Meta-analyses of studies of dose-escalated 
radiotherapy and neoadjuvant androgen deprivation show 
improved disease control compared with standard radiotherapy 
doses, but dose escalation increases bowel side-eff
 ects. 
However, conformal and intensity-modulated radiotherapy 
improves dose distributions of radiotherapy and conformal 
radiotherapy reduces side-eff
 ects.
Added value of this study
The CHHiP trial is, to our knowledge, the largest randomised 
treatment study undertaken in localised prostate cancer. 
We tested two experimental hypofractionated radiotherapy 
schedules using 3 Gy per fraction to total doses of 60 Gy and 57 Gy 
compared with standard fractionation using 2 Gy per fraction to a 
total dose of 74 Gy. We have shown that the hypofractionated 
schedule of 60 Gy in 20 fractions is non-inferior to a standard 
schedule of 74 Gy in 37 fractions for the endpoint of biochemical 
and clinical disease control. Overall treatment time was reduced 
from 7·4 weeks to 4 weeks. 57 Gy in 19 fractions could not be 
claimed to be non-inferior to the control 74 Gy group. The results 
give an estimate of 1·8 Gy for the α/β ratio for prostate cancer. 
Quality controlled IMRT techniques were used and the side-eff
 ect 
profi
 les were favourable and low in all three randomised groups.
Interpretation
The findings from this pre-planned analysis of the CHHiP trial 
show that the hypofractionated IMRT schedule giving 60 Gy in 
3 Gy fractions in 4 weeks is both eff
 ective and safe and can be 
recommended as a new standard of care for patients with 
localised prostate cancer using the high-quality radiotherapy 
techniques described. The results are most robust for patients 
with intermediate-risk disease who received short-course 
androgen deprivation therapy.

On Aug 1, 2006, after 454 patients had been recruited, 
these criteria were revised to refl
 ect the developing 
consensus on use of long-term androgen deprivation in 
locally advanced disease. Thereafter, a PSA concentration 
less than 30 ng/mL and a risk of seminal vesicle 
involvement15 less than 30% were needed. Patients were 
ineligible if they had both T3 tumours and a Gleason 
score of 8 or higher, or a life expectancy of less than 
10 years. Other exclusion criteria included previous 
pelvic radiotherapy or radical prostatectomy, previous 
androgen suppression, another active malignancy in the 
past 5 years (other than cutaneous basal-cell carcinoma), 
comorbid conditions precluding radical radiotherapy, hip 
prosthesis (criterion amended to bilateral hip prosthesis 
Jan 30, 2009), and full anticoagulation treatment 
(criterion removed July 1, 2009). Full details of trial 
design, eligibility, and treatment have been reported 
previously.13 The protocol is available in the appendix 
(pp 27–90).
The study was approved in the UK by the London 
Multi-centre Research Ethics Committee (04/MRE02/10) 
and by the institutional research board of each 
participating international site. The trial was sponsored 
by the Institute of Cancer Research and was done in 
accordance with the principles of good clinical practice. 
All patients provided written informed consent. The 
Institute of Cancer Research Clinical Trials and Statistics 
Unit (ICR-CTSU; London, UK) coordinated the study 
and carried out central statistical data monitoring and all 
analyses. The trial management group was overseen by 
an independent trial steering committee.
Randomisation and masking
Men were registered into the trial before or after com-
mencement of androgen deprivation therapy. Following 
registration, and within 4–6 weeks before radiotherapy, 
patients were randomly assigned (1:1:1) to receive con-
ventional fractionation (control) or one of two hypo-
fractionated schedules. Randomisation was via telephone 
to the ICR-CTSU. Computer-generated random permuted 
blocks of sizes six and nine were used, stratifi
 ed by 
National Comprehensive Cancer Network (NCCN) 
risk-classifi
 cation (low vs intermediate vs high)3 and 
radiotherapy treatment centre. It was not possible to 
mask patients or clinicians to treatment allocation.
Procedures
Short-course androgen deprivation treatment was given 
for 3–6 months before and during radiotherapy; this was 
optional for patients with low-risk disease. Injections 
of a luteinising-hormone-releasing hormone (LHRH) 
analogue 
every 
month, 
combined 
with 
initial 
anti-androgen to reduce testosterone fl
 are, or an anti-
androgen alone, were allowed. Individuals assigned to the 
74 Gy in 37 fractions control group received 2 Gy daily 
fractions (Monday to Friday treatment) for 7·4 weeks. 
Individuals in the experimental groups received 
hypofractionated treatment with 3 Gy daily fractions to a 
total dose of either 60 Gy in 20 fractions in 4·0 weeks 
(≥28 days) or 57 Gy in 19 fractions in 3·8 weeks (≥27 days). 
Biological doses in the hypofractionated schedules were 
calculated to be equivalent to those in the conventional 
schedule assuming α/β ratios of 2·4 Gy for the 60 Gy 
group and 1·4 Gy for the 57 Gy group. All treatment 
groups received intensity-modulated radiation techniques 
(IMRT). Treatment delays for toxic eff
 ects, and for 
technical reasons of up to 5 days, were permitted.
Planning of radiotherapy treatment for all three groups 
was done with forward or inverse three-dimensional 
methods about 12 weeks after the start of hormonal 
treatment. The complex forward-planned multisegment 
technique using an integrated simultaneous boost has 
been previously described16 using three treatment fi
 elds 
with a total of eight segments. Pelvic lymph nodes were 
not included in the target volumes. Mandatory dose 
constraints were defi
 ned for target coverage and 
avoidance of normal tissues including rectum, bowel, 
bladder, and femoral heads. Treatment plans were 
reviewed and dose reductions permitted to meet dose 
constraints. Treatment was delivered with 6–15 MV 
photons with multileaf collimators to shape beams. 
Portal imaging was used to verify treatment accuracy, 
which was to be within 3 mm and was taken at least three 
times during week 1 and at least weekly intervals 
thereafter. Use of image-guided techniques (IGRT) was 
permitted but not required. Details of target volumes, 
dose parameters, and constraints are given in the 
appendix (pp 2, 3, 15). The integral quality-assurance 
programme has previously been described.13
Staging investigations included PSA measurement, 
standard haematology and biochemistry, lymph node 
assessment by pelvic MRI or CT, and bone scans for 
patients at intermediate or high risk. Histology was 
locally assessed with diagnostic transrectal ultrasound-
guided biopsies (or specimens from transurethral 
resection of the prostate) and reported with the Gleason 
system. PSA concentrations were recorded before com-
mencement of androgen deprivation therapy and 
radiotherapy and subsequently at weeks 10, 18, and 
26 after radiotherapy and then at 6-month intervals for 
5 years and subsequently annually.
Baseline, pre-radiotherapy treatment, acute, and late 
toxicity data were collected using physician-completed 
and patient-reported outcome questionnaires. Instru-
ments chosen refl
 ected practice at the time of trial 
commencement, the desirability of assessing symptoms 
before radiotherapy to allow consideration of emergent 
events, and to facilitate comparison with other studies. 
Baseline bowel, bladder, and sexual function assessments 
were made before androgen deprivation therapy and 
radiotherapy and were graded using the Late Eff
 ects 
on Normal Tissues: Subjective/Objective/Management 
(LENT/SOM)17 and Royal Marsden Hospital (RMH)18 
scoring 
systems 
and 
patient-reported

questionnaires. Acute toxicity data were collected for the 
fi
 rst 2163 randomly assigned patients. When the sample 
size was increased (see Statistical analysis) it was felt that 
suffi
  cient data had been collected on acute toxicity to 
allow robust conclusions to be drawn about comparisons 
between the three randomised groups. Reactions were 
graded every week during radiotherapy and at weeks 10, 
12, and 18 from radiotherapy start date using the 
Radiation Therapy Oncology Group (RTOG) scoring 
system for acute toxicity.19 Late side-eff
 ects were then 
assessed beginning 26 weeks after the start of 
radiotherapy and every 6 months for 2 years and then 
yearly to 5 years, as previously described,13 using the 
RTOG grades for late side-eff
 ects,19 RMH, and 
LENT/SOM scoring systems. A quality-of-life substudy 
using patient-reported outcomes was included as 
previously described.20 From trial initiation to early 2009, 
the UCLA-PCI, including the Short Form 36 (SF-36), and 
the Functional Assessment of Cancer Therapy-Prostate 
(FACT-P) quality-of-life instruments were used. After a 
protocol amendment on March 12, 2009, the Expanded 
Prostate Cancer Index Composite (EPIC) and Short 
Form 12 (SF-12) instruments replaced UCLA-PCI, SF-36, 
and FACT-P due to EPIC becoming the patient-reported 
outcome measure of choice. EPIC-50 was used for bowel 
and urinary domains and EPIC-26 for sexual and 
hormonal domains. Patient-reported outcomes to 2 years 
after treatment have been reported.20
Outcomes
The primary outcome measure was time to biochemical 
or clinical failure, defi
 ned as the time from randomisation 
to biochemical failure or prostate cancer recurrence. 
The initial defi
 nition of biochemical failure (PSA >2 ng/mL 
6 months or more after the commencement of 
radiotherapy and a PSA rising by 50% or more from the 
nadir) was updated in 2007, and applied retrospectively, to 
refl
 ect the Phoenix consensus guidelines as a PSA 
concentration greater than nadir plus 2 ng/mL.21 The nadir 
PSA was the lowest concentration recorded at any time 
after commencement of androgen deprivation therapy 
or radiotherapy. A consecutive confi
 rmatory PSA 
concentration was required. Biochemical failure events 
were determined centrally from PSA concentrations and 
confi
 rmed by the local investigator. Prostate cancer 
recurrence events were as reported by the investigator and 
included recommencement of androgen deprivation 
therapy, local recurrence, lymph node or pelvic recurrence, 
and distant metastases.
Secondary effi
  cacy outcome measures were disease-free 
survival (time from randomisation to any prostate 
cancer-related event or death from any cause); overall 
survival (time from randomisation to death from any 
cause); development of metastases; and recommencement 
of hormonal treatment for disease recurrence. Cause of 
death was centrally reviewed by a panel of three trial 
investigators (DD, JG, IS), masked to treatment allocation.
Additional secondary endpoints were acute and late 
side-eff
 ects. Acute toxicity outcomes were summarised 
by reporting the peak and week 18 bowel and bladder 
side-eff
 ects. Clinician-reported late toxicity outcomes 
were the proportion of patients with a grade 2 or worse 
toxic eff
 ect at 2 and 5 years, and time to development of 
grade 1, grade 2, and grade 3 toxicity (assessed using each 
scoring method). Patient-reported outcomes included 
overall bowel, bladder, and sexual dysfunction bother 
reported as single items on the UCLA-PCI and EPIC-50 
instruments.
Statistical analysis
The trial was powered to assess non-inferiority in 
biochemical or clinical failure-free rate between the 
hypofractionated 
and 
conventional 
radiotherapy 
schedules. A three-arm design allowed estimation of 
isoeff
 ective doses for both effi
  cacy and complications. 
We assumed a 70% failure-free rate at 5 years in the 
control group and, with 2163 patients, initially wished to 
exclude a decrease of 6% in a hypofractionated group. 
Due to accrual exceeding expectations, a protocol 
amendment on Nov 23, 2009, increased the sample size 
to allow a smaller non-inferiority margin of 5%, 
corresponding to a critical hazard ratio (HR) of 1·208, to 
be used. This critical HR was used for all non-inferiority 
analyses. To conclude non-inferiority with 80% power 
(one-sided α=0·05), 3163 men (1054 per treatment 
group) were required. This analysis would require 
349 events in the control group but, as agreed with the 
Independent Data Monitoring Committee, data could 
also be considered suffi
  ciently mature for analysis after a 
median follow-up of 5 years. A small allowance (1·5%) 
for dropout or loss to follow-up was incorporated.
Analyses for all time-to-event endpoints were on an 
intention-to-treat basis. The primary outcome was also 
analysed in the per-protocol population, including all 
patients receiving at least one fraction of their allocated 
radiotherapy schedule. For time to biochemical or 
clinical failure, patients event free at the time of analysis 
were censored at their last known PSA assessment. 
For disease-free and overall survival, patients were 
censored at the date they were last known to be alive. 
For development of metastases and recommencement 
of hormonal treatment patients were censored at the 
date they were last seen or date of death.
Kaplan-Meier methods were used to estimate event 
rates. Estimates of treatment eff
 ect were made using 
unadjusted and also adjusted Cox regression models, 
with an HR less than 1 indicating a decreased risk of the 
event in the hypofractionated treatment group compared 
with control. Covariates included in adjusted Cox 
regression models were age (≤69 years vs >69 years), 
NCCN risk group (low vs intermediate vs high), Gleason 
score (≤6 vs >6), clinical stage, and pre-androgen 
deprivation therapy PSA (<10 ng/mL vs 10–20 ng/mL vs 
>20 ng/mL). Although the trial was not designed to

directly 
compare 
the 
hypofractionated 
schedules, 
hypothesis generating comparisons have been made, 
with an HR less than 1 indicating a decreased risk of the 
event in the 60 Gy group compared with the 57 Gy group. 
For time to biochemical or clinical failure, HRs are 
provided with two-sided 90% CIs (equivalent to one-sided 
95% CIs) in accordance with the one-sided non-inferiority 
design. p values to reject the null hypothesis of HR of 
1·208 or greater (pNI) are reported. In all other instances, 
95% CIs are reported. Comparisons were made between 
the control group and each hypofractionated group using 
the log-rank test, with a p value less than 0·05 indicating 
statistical signifi
 cance.
Absolute treatment diff
 erences (δ) in time to 
biochemical or clinical failure have been calculated 
based on the Kaplan-Meier estimate of the failure-free 
rate in the control group and the HR. A competing risks 
analysis was done using the methods of Fine and Gray 
for the primary outcome measure, with death due to any 
cause as the competing event with consistent results 
(data not shown). Pre-planned subgroup analyses of the 
primary outcome by NCCN risk group were done in 
addition to multivariable analyses adjusting for risk 
group and prespecifi
 ed clinically prognostic factors.

 ect was tested using

was estimated10 assuming a linear fi
 t for data from the 
hypofractionated groups.
Acute toxicity analyses were done in the safety 
population, including all patients who received at least 
one fraction of radiotherapy. All available data were used 
irrespective of timing of assessment, with the exception 
of comparisons at 18 weeks, where a 2 week window 
either side of the expected date was used. Pairwise 
comparisons of the distribution of acute toxicity scores 
were compared using Mann-Whitney tests. For each late 
toxicity scale, the proportion of late grade 2 or worse 
toxicity at 2 years and 5 years is reported with exact 
binomial 95% CIs. Fisher’s exact tests were used to 
compare each hypofractionated group with control. Time 
to fi
 rst late adverse event was compared with the use of 
the Kaplan-Meier method. Patients not experiencing an 
event were censored at last known toxicity assessment. 
The proportion of small or worse patient-reported bother 
and time to fi
 rst very small, small, moderate, or worse 
late bother score were analysed as for late toxicity 
endpoints. To make some allowance for multiple testing 
of toxicity and patient-reported endpoints, a p value of 
less than 0·01 was considered statistically signifi
 cant.
For all time-to-event analyses the proportional hazards 
assumption of the Cox model was tested using Schoenfeld 
residuals and found to hold (appendix pp 25–26).
Analyses were based on a database snapshot taken on 
Sept 8, 2015, and were done using Stata version 13. The 
CHHiP trial is registered as an International Standard 
Randomised Controlled Trial, number ISRCTN97182923.

Results
Between Oct 18, 2002, and June 17, 2011, 3216 men were 
recruited from 71 centres in the UK, Republic of Ireland, 
Switzerland, and New Zealand (appendix pp 1, 4–5). 
1065 patients were assigned to the conventional 74 Gy 
schedule, 1074 to the 60 Gy schedule, and 1077 to the 
57 Gy schedule; 64 patients received no radiotherapy 
(fi
 gure 1). Demographic and clinical characteristics were 
balanced across treatment groups (table). 3213 (97%) 
patients received concurrent androgen deprivation 
therapy, with 2700 (84%) patients receiving LHRH 
analogues and short-term anti-androgens. Most patients 
who did not receive androgen deprivation therapy had 
low-risk disease (73 [78%] of 93 patients). For patients 
who received androgen deprivation treatment, the 
median duration before commencement of radiotherapy 
was 16 weeks (IQR 15–20). Overall, 3152 (98%) patients 
 
received radiotherapy, and 3117 (97%) received the 
allocated dose and fractionation schedule (fi
 gure 1). 
Treatment delays of 1 week or more occurred in only 
23 (1%) patients. At the time of analysis, median 
follow-up was 62·6 months (54·1–77·2) in the 74 Gy 
group, 62·2 months (53·9–77·2) in the 60 Gy group, and 
62·4 months (53·7–76·6) in the 57 Gy group.
By 5 years, the number of patients with biochemical 
or clinical  events were 111 of 1065 in the 74 Gy group, 
88 of 1074 in the 60 Gy group, and 132 of 1077 in the 
57 Gy group, respectively. 5-year biochemical or clinical 
failure-free rates were 88·3% (95% CI 86·0–90·2) in the 
74 Gy group, 90·6% (88·5–92·3) in the 60 Gy group, 
and 85·9% (83·4–88·0) in the 57 Gy group (fi
 gure 2A, 
appendix p 6). With reference to the critical HR for 
non-inferiority, 60 Gy was non-inferior to 74 Gy with 
HR 0·84 (90% CI 0·68–1·03), pNI=0·0018. Since the 
upper limit of the 90% CI for the HR comparing 57 Gy 
with 74 Gy (HR 1·20 [0·99–1·46]) exceeds 1·208 
(pNI=0·48), non-inferiority of the 57 Gy schedule relative 
to 74 Gy cannot be claimed. To facilitate comparison 
with other studies, 95% CIs were estimated as 0·65–1·07 
for the HR in the 60 Gy group and 0·96–1·51 for the HR 
in the 57 Gy group. The estimated absolute diff
 erence in 
the proportion of patients in the hypofractionated 
groups free from biochemical or clinical failure 
compared with that in the control group at 5 years is 
δ=1·80% (90% CI –0·34 to 3·58) for 60 Gy versus 74 Gy 
and δ=–2·20% (–4·88 to 0·08) for 57 Gy versus 74 Gy. 
Analyses in the per-protocol population confi
 rmed these 
results (60 Gy, HR 0·83 [90% CI 0·68–1·02], pNI=0·0015, 
δ=1·88% [90% CI –0·27 to 3·67]; 57 Gy, HR 1·17 
[0·97 to 1·42], pNI=0·40, δ=–1·92% [–4·59 to 0·34]).
Estimates of the HR adjusted for age (≤69 years vs 
>69 years), NCCN risk group, Gleason score (≤6 vs ≥7), 
clinical stage, and pre-androgen deprivation therapy 
PSA (<10 ng/mL vs 10–20 ng/mL vs >20 ng/mL) also 
confi
 rmed these results (60 Gy vs 74 Gy, HR 0·86 [90% 
CI 0·70–1·06], p=0·25; 57 Gy vs 74 Gy, HR 1·21 [90% CI 
0·99–1·46], p=0·11; appendix p 7). Prespecifi
 ed subgroup 
analyses of time to biochemical or clinical failure showed 
no signifi
 cant interactions with treatment group, except 
for age, where older men (age >69 years) had a reduced 
biochemical or clinical failure rate with 60 Gy compared 
with 74 Gy, but younger men (age ≤69 years) showed no 
diff
 erence in biochemical or clinical failure rate between 
treatment groups; however, this diff
 erence was not seen 
for the 57 Gy group (fi
 gure 3). In an exploratory 
secondary analysis to compare 60 Gy in 20 fractions with 
57 Gy in 19 fractions the HR was 0·70 (95% CI 0·55–0·88, 
log-rank p=0·0026; δ=4·07% [95% CI 1·56–6·10]; 
appendix p 6).

At 5 years, biochemical and clinical failure-free rates 
for the NCCN low-risk, intermediate-risk, and high-risk 
groups were: 96·7% (95% CI 92·3–98·6), 86·8% 
(84·0–89·1), and 86·5% (78·4–91·7) for the 74 Gy group; 
96·6% (92·1–98·6), 90·2% (87·7–92·3), and 84·2% 
(75·7–90·0) for the 60 Gy group; and 90·9% (85·1–94·5), 
86·0% (83·1–88·5), and 78·3% (69·2–85·0) for the 
57 Gy group, respectively (appendix p 16).
92 (9%) deaths were reported in the 74 Gy group, 73 (7%) 
in the 60 Gy group, and 87 (8%) in the 57 Gy group. Of 
252 deaths reported, 40 (16%) were prostate cancer related, 
88 (35%) were due to a second malignancy, 111 (44%) were 
non-cancer causes, and 13 (5%) were of unknown cause. 
No signifi
 cant diff
 erences in overall survival were observed 
between the control group and either of the hypofractionated 
groups (fi
 gure 2B; appendix p 6).
Progression events or death occurred in 209 (20%) of 
1065 patients in the 74 Gy group, 179 (17%) of 1074 in the 
60 Gy group, and 227 (21%) of 1077 in the 57 Gy group. 
Disease-free survival at 5 years was 82·3% (95% CI 
79·6–84·6) in the 74 Gy group, 85·3% (82·8–87·5) in the 
60 Gy group, and 80·1% (77·3–82·6) in the 57 Gy group.

Compared with 74 Gy, the HR for disease-free survival 
was 0·83 (95% CI 0·68–1·01) in the 60 Gy group and 1·08 
(0·90–1·31) in the 57 Gy group. 103 (3%) patients 
developed distant metastases: 32 (3%) in the 74 Gy group, 
29 (3%) in the 60 Gy group, and 42 (4%) in the 57 Gy 
group. Androgen deprivation therapy was recommenced 
in 80 (8%) patients in the 74 Gy group, 70 (7%) in the 
60 Gy group, and 89 (8%) in the 57 Gy group. Time to 
recommencement of androgen deprivation therapy and 
development of distant metastases were not signifi
 cantly 
diff
 erent between either of the hypo 
fractionated schedules 
and the 74 Gy schedule (appendix pp 6, 17).
Acute RTOG bowel and bladder symptoms peaked 
sooner in the hypofractionated schedules than in the 
control, at 4–5 weeks compared with 7–8 weeks (fi
 gure 4, 
appendix p 18). There was signifi
 cantly more acute bowel 
toxicity at the peak in the hypofractionated schedules 
compared with the control; the proportion of patients 
reporting RTOG grade 2 or worse bowel toxicity was 
176 (25%) of 715 patients with available assessments in 
the 74 Gy group, 277 (38%) of 720 in the 60 Gy group 
(vs 74 Gy, p<0·0001), and 270 (38%) of 713 in the 57 Gy 
group (vs 74 Gy, p<0·0001; fi
 gure 4A). However, the 
distribution of bladder toxicity by grade was similar 
across all groups; the proportion of patients with available 
assessments reporting RTOG grade 2 or worse bladder 
toxicity was 331 (46%) of 715 in the 74 Gy group compared 
with 356 (49%) of 720 in the 60 Gy group (p=0·34), and 
327 (46%) of 713 in the 57 Gy group (p=0·90; fi
 gure 4B). 
By 18 weeks, both bowel and bladder toxicity by RTOG 
assessment were similar between treatment groups 
(fi
 gure 4). Of 592 patients treated with 74 Gy with 
available assessments, 15 (3%) and 34 (6%) reported 
RTOG grade 2 or worse bowel and bladder toxicity, 
respectively. Corresponding proportions in the 60 Gy 
group (607 patients treated with available assessments) 
were 20 (3%) bowel  (p=0·38) and 30 (5%) bladder 
(p=1·00), and in the 57 Gy group (508 patients treated 
with available assessments) were 15 (3%) bowel (p=0·60) 
and 30 (5%) bladder (p=0·10).
All radiotherapy schedules showed a low frequency of 
late bowel and bladder side-eff
 ects (fi
 gure 5, appendix 
pp 19–22). 2 years from the start of treatment fewer 
assessable patients treated with 57 Gy reported RTOG 
grade 2 or worse bowel symptoms as compared with 74 Gy 
control (74 Gy, 35 [4%] of 922 vs 57 Gy, 17 [2%] of 962; 
p=0·0075); however, no diff
 erence was observed between 
the 60 Gy group (28 [3%] of 959) and the 74 Gy group 
(p=0·31); this was evident across all clinician-reported 
toxicity scales (RTOG, RMH, and LENT-SOM; fi
 gure 5A, 
appendix pp 8, 19–20). The proportion of RTOG grade 2 or 
worse bladder symptoms at 2 years was similar across all 
treatment groups (74 Gy, 13 [1%] of 922; 60 Gy, 16 [2%] of 
959 [vs 74 Gy, p=0·71]; 57 Gy, 11 [1%] of 962 [vs 74 Gy, 
p=0·68]), with no signifi
 cant diff
 erence observed between 
control and either hypofractionated group on any scale 
(fi
 gure 5B, appendix pp 9, 21–22). Sexual dysfunction was 
common at baseline and increased with androgen 
deprivation therapy; although this partially recovered after 
radiotherapy it remained higher than baseline in all 
groups (appendix pp 10, 13, 23–24). The proportion of 
LENT-SOM grade 2 or worse sexual symptoms at 2 years 
was similar in each treatment group (74 Gy, 550 [67%] of 
826 assessable patients; 60 Gy, 562 [65%] of 864 [vs 74 Gy, 
p=0·54]; 57 Gy, 552 [64%] of 859, [vs 74 Gy, p=0·33).
At 5 years post-radiotherapy, the frequency of grade 2 
or worse bowel, bladder, and sexual toxicity across 
clinician-reported toxicity scales was similar across 
fractionation schedules (appendix pp 8–10). We identifi
 ed 
no signifi
 cant diff
 erences in the incidence of late grade 1 or 
worse, grade 2 or worse, or grade 3 or worse bowel, bladder, 
or sexual symptoms in either hypofractionated group

Figure 5: Late bowel and bladder toxicity by timepoint, assessment, and randomised treatment group
Grade distribution of (A) bowel adverse events and (B) bladder adverse events measured with RTOG. Cumulative incidence of (C) bowel adverse events measured with RTOG and (E) bowel symptom 
scores measured with UCLA PCI/EPIC. Cumulative incidence of (D) bladder adverse events measured with RTOG and (F) bladder symptom scores measured with UCLA PCI/EPIC. Late toxicity data have 
been included in analyses if they were reported within 6 weeks of the 6 month visit, within 3 months of the 12–24 month visit, and within 6 months of the 36–60 month visit. For UCLA/EPIC, before 
androgen deprivation therapy data were included if they were reported within 3 months before starting androgen deprivation therapy and within 1 month after starting androgen deprivation therapy. 
Before radiotherapy data are included if they were reported within 3 months before radiotherapy and no more than 7 days after starting radiotherapy. Time-to-event analyses use all data reported 
from 6 weeks before the 6 month visit onwards. RTOG=Radiation Therapy Oncology Group scale. UCLA PCI=UCLA Prostate Cancer Index. EPIC=Expanded Prostate Cancer Index Composite.

[0·64–1·11], p=0·22). Estimated cumulative incidences of 
grade 2 or worse bladder toxicity at 5 years measured with 
the RTOG scale were 9·1% (66 events) for the 74 Gy group, 
11·7% (88 events) for the 60 Gy group (HR compared with 
74 Gy 1·34 [95% CI 0·98–1·85], p=0·07) and 6·6% 
(57 events) for the 57 Gy group (HR 0·85 [0·60–1·21], 
p=0·37; fi
 gure 5, appendix p 9). There was a slightly higher 
frequency of grade 2 or worse bowel and bladder side-
eff
 ects in the 60 Gy group compared with 57 Gy at 2 and 
5 years on most clinician-reported scales (appendix 
pp 8–9). Cumulative incidence of LENT-SOM grade 2 or 
worse bowel side-eff
 ects was higher in the 60 Gy group 
compared with the 57 Gy group (HR 1·39 [95% CI 
1·14–1·70], p=0·0010; appendix p 8), but this diff
 erence 
was not seen with other toxicity scales. Cumulative 
incidence of grade 2 or worse RTOG bladder toxicity was 
also greater in the 60 Gy group versus the 57 Gy group 
(HR 1·58 [1·13–2·20], p=0·0073; fi
 gure 5, appendix p 9), 
although this was not seen with other toxicity scales. More 
serious grade 3 or worse toxicities were rare in all groups 
(fi
 gure 5). At 5 years, the proportions of patients with 
RTOG grade 3 or worse bowel events were none of 
534 patients in the 74 Gy group, two (<1%) of 569 patients 
in the 60 Gy group, and three of 549 (<1%) in the 57 Gy 
group; RTOG grade 3 or worse bladder events occurred in 
two (<1%) of 534 patients in the 74 Gy group, four (<1%) of 
569 patients in the 60 Gy group, and fi
 ve (1%) of 
549 patients in the 57 Gy group. The estimated cumulative 
incidence of grade 3 or worse bowel and bladder adverse 
events at 5 years was 2% (17 events) and 3% (27 events) 
in the 74 Gy group, 3% (20 events) and 6% (38 events) in 
the 60 Gy group, and 4% (23 events) and 3% (21 events) in 
the 57 Gy group, respectively (fi
 gure 5C, D). No treatment-
related deaths were reported.
Patient-reported outcomes showed no signifi
 cant 
diff
 erences in the proportion of small or worse bowel, 
bladder, or sexual bother at 2 or 5 years (fi
 gure 5, appendix 
pp 8–13). At 5 years, the proportion of assessable patients 
reporting small or worse bowel bother was 49 (14%) of 
341 in the 74 Gy group, 57 (15%) of 375 in the 60 Gy 
group, and 59 (15%) of 387 in the 57 Gy group. The 
corresponding fi
 gures for bladder bother were 56 (17%) 
of 333, 63 (17%) of 371, and 60 (16%) of 376, respectively, 
and for sexual bother were 187 (52%) of 357, 184 (52%) of 
357 and 195 (53%) of 370, respectively. The cumulative 
incidence of late small or worse bother in each 
hypofractionated schedule was not signifi
 cantly diff
 erent 
from control for bowel, bladder, and sexual symptoms, 
and there were no signifi
 cant diff
 erences between the 
hypofractionated groups (fi
 gure 5E, F, appendix pp 8–10).
Discussion
In this pre-planned analysis with a median follow-up of 
over 5 years, we found that the 60 Gy hypofractionated 
schedule is non-inferior to the 74 Gy conventionally 
fractionated schedule in terms of time to biochemical or 
clinical failure for patients with localised prostate cancer. 
Evaluation of the lower 57 Gy hypofractionated schedule 
was inconclusive: it cannot be stated to be non-inferior to 
the 74 Gy control group but it was inferior to the 60 Gy 
group. Notably, the proportion of patients free from 
biochemical or clinical failure at 5 years in all treatment 
groups (88·3% for the 74 Gy group, 90·6% for the 60 Gy 
group, and 85·9% for the 57 Gy group) were considerably 
higher than the 71% reported for the 74 Gy group in the 
national MRC RT01 trial.6 Recent meta-analyses5,22 
identifi
 ed fi
 ve relatively small phase 3 trials comparing 
modest hypofractionation with conventional 1·8–2·0 Gy 
fractions. A total of 1825 patients were included, although 
1153 received relatively low doses of radiotherapy 
(≤67 Gy in the control groups). There were no consistent 
diff
 erences between randomised groups, and the 
investigators concluded that larger trials were required to 
establish the non-inferiority of hypofractionation for 
clinical eff
 ectiveness. In the CHHiP trial, we estimate the 
α/β ratio to be 1·8 Gy, which is in keeping with previous 
reports23 and recent large series and meta-analyses which 
have suggested the α/β ratio to be between 1·4 Gy and 
1·93 Gy.24–27 Our estimate does not account for any 
time factor related to overall treatment duration and 
the potential eff
 ect of accelerated repopulation.26 
The improvement in 5-year disease control for a 3 Gy dose 
diff
 erence between the 57 Gy and 60 Gy groups is in 
keeping with the review of the six randomised controlled 
dose-escalation trials previously reported5,6 and a recent 
meta-analysis of biologically equivalent dose escalation.28
Five other contemporary phase 3 studies have reported 
side-eff
 ects related to hypofractionated radiotherapy29–33 
(appendix p 14). We initially reported no diff
 erences 
between the three randomised groups in the frequency  of 
side-eff
 ects in the fi
 rst 457 patients recruited to the CHHiP 
trial with 2 years follow-up.13,20 Analysis of acute side-eff
 ects 
in the full CHHiP cohort has confi
 rmed no diff
 erence in 
bladder side-eff
 ects except that the wave of toxicity occurs 
earlier in the hypofractionated groups. However, we have 
now documented that the peak acute bowel toxicity is 
greater in patients receiving a hypofractionated schedule, 
although it is noteworthy that only 2% of patients had 
grade 3 or worse toxic eff
 ects and only 1% had a 
prolongation of treatment time of more than 1 week, 
indicating the tolerability of the hypofractionated 
schedules. An increased acute gastrointestinal reaction in 
patients treated with hypofractionated radio 
therapy has 
been noted by other investigators29,32 but not by Norkus 
and colleagues,33 who treated patients using a 4 day per 
week schedule. The diff
 erent treatment schedules and 
total dose given might account for these diff
 erences 
(appendix p 14). There were no signifi
 cant diff
 erences in 
late bowel toxicity between the 74 Gy and 60 Gy groups in 
any of the domains at any timepoint. The 57 Gy group had 
less grade 1 or worse and grade 2 or worse LENT-SOM 
bowel and grade 2 or worse RTOG bladder side-eff
 ects 
than the 60 Gy group with outcomes on other toxicity 
scales supporting this eff
 ect, although they were not

signifi
 cant; there were no signifi
 cant diff
 erences between 
the 57 Gy and 60 Gy groups in sexual function domains. 
The results are in accord with a recent meta-analysis 
indicating the general tolerability of hypofractionated 
radiotherapy,5,22 although two studies have reported 
approximate doublings of grade 2 gastro 
intestinal31 or 
genitourinary30 side-eff
 ects compared with conventional 
1·8–2·0 Gy fractions (appendix p 14).
Post-radiotherapy symptoms relate to treatment 
methods, total dose, patient factors, and fractionation 
schedules. The favourable results in the CHHiP study 
refl
 ect the mandated radiotherapy technique using an 
integrated simultaneous boost with relatively narrow 
planning target volume margins16 and normal tissue dose 
constraints. The cumulative rate of RTOG grade 2 or 
worse gastrointestinal side-eff
 ects observed by 5 years 
was 14% compared with 33% for the 74 Gy group in the 
RT01 trial,34 which used conformal radiotherapy without 
specifi
 ed dose constraints. We previously reported 
complementary fi
 ndings from the CHHiP trial showing a 
greater than 50% reduction in bowel bother or distress 
compared with the RT01 trial using the UCLA-PCI 
instrument.20 Additionally, the apparently more favourable 
bladder toxicity results reported in the CHHiP trial 
compared with other studies might relate to lower total 
delivered dose29,30 or amount of bladder and trigone 
included in the high-dose volume,31 which would be in 
keeping with our observation of lower side-eff
 ects in the 
57 Gy compared with 60 Gy hypo 
fractioned groups. 
This fi
 nding suggests that a steep dose–volume 
association might exist for late bladder complications 
using hypofractionated schedules.
Strengths of the CHHiP trial include its size and 
multicentre recruitment. Consistent and quality assured 
radiotherapy delivery in 40 centres demonstrates the 
generalisability of the radiotherapy techniques. The study 
design, using two experimental hypofractionated groups, 
enables clarity of clinical interpretation. Limitations are 
that results are primarily applicable to patients receiving 
short-course androgen deprivation therapy (97% of the 
men treated) and might not be generalisable for 
populations who do not receive androgen deprivation 
therapy, and are most robust for patients with 
intermediate-risk disease (73% of the men treated), 
although there was no heterogeneity of eff
 ect across all 
risk groups. We have found a low level of side-eff
 ects in 
all groups. However, further follow-up is required to 
assess 10-year and 15-year outcomes, and it is possible 
that diff
 erences might yet emerge. Because the 
hypofractionated and conventional radiotherapy were 
given over diff
 erent lengths of time, the study does not 
address the issue of treatment duration and accelerated 
repopulation in prostate cancer and our estimate of the 
α/β ratio of 1·8 Gy does not include a time factor.
Other complementary phase 3 studies treating patients 
with prostate cancer with radiotherapy alone without 
androgen deprivation therapy and using hypofractionated 
radiotherapy with diff
 erent treatment durations will 
clarify these issues. In the Netherlands, the HYPRO study 
(ISRCTN85133859)32 randomised 820 patients with 
intermediate-risk or high-risk disease to high-dose 
conventional radiotherapy (78 Gy in 39 fractions) or 
dose-escalated hypofractionated radiotherapy of 64·6 Gy 
in 19 fractions given over a period of 6–7 weeks with or 
without androgen deprivation therapy. In Canada, the 
PROFIT trial (ISRCTN43853433) has randomised 
1204 men with intermediate-risk disease to receive either 
60 Gy in 20 fractions over 4 weeks or 78 Gy in 39 fractions. 
For the low-risk patient group, the RTOG 0415 study 
recruited 1115 patients who were randomly assigned to 
receive 70 Gy in 28 fractions over 5·5 weeks or 73·8 Gy in 
41 fractions over 8·1 weeks. More extreme forms of 
hypofractionated radiotherapy are now being studied. 
The HYPO trial (ISRCTN45905321) will shortly complete 
recruitment of 1200 men comparing 43·7 Gy in seven 
fractions over 15–19 days with 78 Gy in 39 fractions over 
7·8 weeks and the PACE trial (ISRCTN17627211) 
compares 36·25 Gy in fi
 ve fractions over 1–2 weeks with 
78 Gy in 39 fractions over 7·8 weeks. Both trials use IGRT, 
which permits reduced target margins around the 
prostate, and might reduce treatment side-eff
 ects. 
Outcome results will not be available for several years.
Prostate cancer radiotherapy accounts for 27% of the 
workload of radiotherapy departments in the UK.35 
Radical external-beam radiotherapy was given to 
14 364 patients in 2014–15 in England and Wales 
involving 455 638 attendances. Before commencement 
of the CHHiP trial, 3 Gy fraction schedules were rarely 
used, but by 2014–15, after publication of initial safety 
results,13 19% of patients received 3 Gy hypofractionated 
schedules (Ball C, personal communication). A uniform 
change to a 20-fraction schedule could reduce the 
number of treatment fractions and attendances by over 
200 000 annually in the UK. The CHHiP trial results 
show that the combination of hypofractionation and 
high-quality radiotherapy tech 
niques gives excellent 
tumour control, a low level of side-eff
 ects, and increased 
convenience for patients compared with a conventional 
fractionation schedule. High-dose modest hypo 
frac-
tionation using high-quality treatment methods such as 
those used in this trial should become a new standard of 
care for external-beam radiotherapy. The trial results 
might act as a benchmark for comparison with other 
treatment approaches, including radical prostatec 
tomy, 
brach 
ytherapy, and external beam radiation therapy 
without androgen deprivation therapy or using extreme 
hypofractionation schedules.
