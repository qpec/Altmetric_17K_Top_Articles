Abstract
Whether and how neurons that are present in both sexes of the same species can differentiate in a 
sexually dimorphic manner is not well understood. A comparison of the connectomes of the 
Caenorhabditis elegans hermaphrodite and male nervous systems reveals the existence of sexually 
dimorphic synaptic connections between neurons present in both sexes. Here, we demonstrate sex-
specific functions of these sex-shared neurons and show that many neurons initially form synapses 
in a hybrid manner in both the male and hermaphrodite pattern before sexual maturation. Sex-
specific synapse pruning then results in the sex-specific maintenance of subsets of the connections. 
Reversal of the sexual identity of either the pre- or postsynaptic neuron alone transforms the 
patterns of synaptic connectivity to that of the opposite sex. A dimorphically expressed and 
phylogenetically conserved transcription factor is both necessary and sufficient to determine sex-
specific connectivity patterns. Our studies reveal new insights into sex-specific circuit 
development.
Like other invertebrate or vertebrate nervous systems, the nervous system of C. elegans 
contains a number of sex-specific neurons, most of which are generated during the process 
of sexual maturation in late larval stages. Apart from these sex-specific neurons (8 in 
hermaphrodites, 91 in males), there are 294 neurons shared by both sexes, most of which 
embryonically generated1,2. The hermaphrodite and male versions of these shared neurons 
display the same lineage history, the same cell body position, share molecular features (e.g. 
neurotransmitter identity) and display similar neurite projection patterns 1,3–5. Intriguingly, 
the recent reconstruction of the posterior nervous system of the C. elegans adult male3 and 
its comparison to the connectome of the hermaphrodite (a derived female) 6 shows that 
several of the sex-shared neurons are strongly sexually dimorphic in their synaptic wiring

 patterns. These anatomical observations provide a fascinating opportunity to study the 
question of how seemingly similar sex-shared neurons develop sexually dimorphic 
characteristics.
Sexually dimorphic synaptic target choices between sex-shared neurons
Here, we focus on a group of sex-shared, but dimorphically connected sensory, inter- and 
motorneurons (Fig. 1a)3. The sexually dimorphic connectivity differences do not simply 
reflect sex-specific modifications of similar neuronal circuits, but sex-shared neurons rather 
wire into completely distinct circuits (Fig. 1a)3. For example, the PHB phasmid sensory 
neuron synapses onto three different, sex-shared command interneurons only in 
hermaphrodites (AVA, AVD and PVC). In males, PHB rather connects to a sex-shared 
interneuron, AVG which in turns connects to downstream motor neurons again only in males 
(Fig. 1a). To examine whether dimorphic connections are due to dimorphic synaptic partner 
choice or a reflection of sex-specific neuron or process placement, we analyzed serial 
electron micrographs and found that the PHA and PHB phasmid neuron processes are 
directly adjacent to the AVG process in both sexes (Extended Data Fig. 1). Dimorphic 
connections between these neurons are therefore a consequence of sex-specific synaptic 
partner choice.
While EM provides a powerful tool to identify synaptic partners, the presently available EM 
analysis relies on one or two animals at a single stage (adult). To confirm the EM results, 
and to visualize the reproducibility as well as the developmental aspects of dimorphic 
synapses, we used two distinct transsynaptic labeling techniques (Fig. 1c), “GRASP” (“GFP 
Reconstitution Across Synaptic Partners”)7 and “iBLINC” (in vivo Biotin Labeling of 
INtercellular Contact)8. We generated transgenic lines in which seven distinct synaptically 
connected neuron pairs are labeled with GRASP and/or iBLINC (Fig. 1b; Extended Data 
Fig. 2,Fig. 3). Using cytosolic mCherry to label neurites, we examined synaptic puncta along 
these mCherry-labeled, adjacent processes. For all seven synaptic connections examined, we 
identified discrete synaptic puncta that appear in the sexually dimorphic manner predicted 
by the EM analysis (Fig. 1a,b; Extended Data Fig. 1,Fig. 3).
Sexually dimorphic functions of sex-shared neurons
To assess whether sexually dimorphic wiring is an indication of dimorphic neuronal 
function, we either surgically removed individual, dimorphically connected neurons or 
genetically silenced them using ectopic expression of a histamine-gated chloride channel 9. 
Silencing of the PHB neurons (using a driver that is strongly and consistently expressed only 
in PHB; Extended Data Fig. 4) affected forward locomotion of hermaphrodites, but not of 
males (Extended Data Fig. 5a). Another, previously described PHB function, also displays 
striking sex-specificity. Specifically, it has been shown that the PHB sensory neuron 
modulates chemorepulsive behavior of hermaphrodites in response to the noxious chemical 
SDS10. The modulatory effect of PHB is observed upon functionally disabling subsets of 
head sensory neurons10. Such head neuron-defective animals fail to avoid SDS because PHB 
provides an antagonistic input to command interneurons10. This antagonistic input to the 
command circuit is revealed through ablation of PHB, which restores the ability of head

 sensory-neuron defective animals to avoid SDS10. We corroborated this antagonistic input 
through silencing of PHB with a histamine-gated chloride channel, by examining ceh-14 
mutant animals, in which all three phasmid neurons fail to adopt their glutamatergic 
identity 11, and by silencing both ASH and PHB neurons (Fig. 2a; Extended Data Fig. 5d–e). 
Importantly, male PHB does not connect to command interneurons and no antagonistic input 
to the command circuit is expected. One would therefore predict that the disabling of head 
sensory-neuron function in males (ASH silenced and ablated; or tax-4 mutants) should not 
have the impact on SDS avoidance that is observed in hermaphrodites. We indeed found this 
to be the case (Fig. 2a; Extended Data Fig. 5).
If male PHB neurons are not involved in the avoidance of noxious chemicals, what function 
do they adopt in males? We noted that the male-specific innervation target of PHB, the 
interneuron AVG, becomes innervated by male-specific hook sensory neurons (HOA and 
HOB), known to be involved in sensing a hermaphrodite-derived signal that induces males to 
stop at the vulva during mating behavior12. Moreover, PHB also innervates HOA directly3. 
Through genetic silencing, genetic ablation and microsurgical laser ablations, we found that 
PHB and AVG are involved in responding to this vulva stop signal (Fig. 2b,c). Ablation of 
VD13, one of the motor neurons innervated by AVG specifically in males also causes vulva 
location defects (Fig. 2c) and so does ablation of the LUA neuron (Extended Data Fig. 6). 
PHB also innervates the male-specific PVX and PVY neurons, involved in mate contact-
induced backward locomotion in males 13 and silencing PHB affects this sexually dimorphic 
behavior as well (Fig. 2d). We conclude that PHB has sexually dimorphic functions, 
modulating locomotion and processing repulsive environmental sensory information in 
hermaphrodites while sensing hermaphrodite-derived mating cues in males (summarized in 
Extended Data Fig. 6c).
Sex-shared, interneurons also display sexually dimorphic functions. We found that the 
dimorphically connected LUA neuron is also involved in response to vulva stop signal in 
males, while automated worm-tracking analysis 14 revealed that ablation of LUAs results in 
pausing defects in hermaphrodites but not in males (Extended Data Fig. 6).
Sexually dimorphic synapses are formed by pruning or are prepatterned
We next asked how sexually dimorphic connectivity patterns are established. With the 
exception of the VD13 neuron (which is born at the end of the first larval stage15), the 
shared neurons that we analyzed are born and project their neurites during embryogenesis. 
Sex-specific neurons in the tail are born in the last larval stage16 and male-specific behaviors 
emerge soon after17. One could therefore envision that dimorphic connections between the 
embryonically born neurons could form during sexual maturation, i.e. long after the 
respective neurons and axonal patterns have been established in the animal (“late 
maturation” model; Fig. 3a). Alternatively, a “default connectivity” could be established by 
both sexes early in development, followed by a sex-specific synapse rewiring upon sexual 
maturation (“rewiring” model; Fig. 3a). By analyzing connectivity throughout larval 
development using the GRASP and iBLINC systems, we discovered two different 
mechanisms – a “pruning” mechanism, used by many different neurons, and a 
“prepatterning” mechanism used by others (Fig. 3a).

 For example, PHB neurons connect to AVA and AVG in hermaphrodites and males at early 
larval stages (Fig. 3b,c). Therefore, male-specific pruning of the PHB>AVA synapses results 
in an adult male-specific PHB>AVG connection, and conversely, hermaphrodite-specific 
pruning of the PHB>AVG synapses results in the hermaphrodite specific PHB>AVA 
synapses. We observed these synaptic pruning events to occur during sexual maturation in 
the fourth larval stage (L4) (Extended Data Fig. 7).
Since the PHB>AVA connection exists in both sexes at the L1 stage, we asked whether at 
this stage both hermaphrodites and males display a PHB-dependent modulation of the 
repulsive response to noxious chemicals. We indeed found this to be the case (Fig. 2a). The 
repulsive response was restored in both sexes upon silencing of PHB (Extended Data Fig. 
5f). These observations demonstrate that PHB does not merely acquire dimorphic functions 
in the adult, but that in males, PHB neurons undergo a repurposing of function, from initially 
being involved in sensing noxious environmental cues to processing sex-specific cues.
Sexually dimorphic pruning of synaptic connections can also be observed in a number of 
additional neuronal contexts (Fig. 3; Extended Data Fig. 2). For example, PHA connects to 
AVG in both sexes at the L1 stage, but this connection is selectively lost in males (Fig. 3b–
c). Similarly, the AVG interneuron connects to the cholinergic DA9 motor neuron in both 
sexes at the L1 stage, but the synaptic connection persists only in males, not hermaphrodites 
(Fig. 1d, Fig. 3b–c).
One other sexually dimorphic synaptic connection arises by a fundamentally different 
principle: The AVG to VD13 connection is only ever observed in males, and never in 
hermaphrodites (Fig. 1d, Fig. 3b–c). Some prepatterning is also already evident in the 
pruned AVG>DA9 synapses; these are present in both sexes in the L1 stage, but are stronger 
in the male (Fig. 3b–c). Analysis of ~1,000 serial EM sections shows that the axons of the 
AVG and VD13 (synaptically connected in a male-specific manner) are more adjacent in 
males compared to hermaphrodites (Extended Data Fig. 1). Even though we cannot exclude 
the possibility that dimorphic adjacency is a mere secondary consequence of failure to 
establish synaptic contact, we propose that the prepatterning of dimorphic synapse may be a 
consequence of dimorphic axon placement. Taken together, we identified two types of 
synaptic maturation events pruning events that coincide with sexual maturation and 
dimorphic prepatterning events that precede sexual maturation (summarized in Fig. 3d).
The sex of either pre- or postsynaptic neuron controls synaptic patterning
Are sexually dimorphic wiring patterns determined by the sex of both the pre- and post-
synaptic cell or perhaps by non cell-autonomous processes? We addressed this question by 
generating sexually mosaic animals through cell-type specific, ectopic expression of the 
fem-3 gene, which downregulates the global, hermaphroditic identity determinant TRA-1, a 
Gli-type Zn finger transcription factor, thereby imposing a male identity on the specific cell 
type in an otherwise hermaphroditic animal4,18,19. Conversely, ectopic, cell-type specific 
expression of the intracellular domain of the TRA-2 receptor (“TRA-2IC”) feminizes cells 
via stabilization of the TRA-1 transcription factor in otherwise male animals17,20. We found 
that identity transformations of single neurons transformed synaptic wiring patterns to that

 of the opposite sex (Fig. 4; Extended Data Fig. 8). For example, masculinization of PHB 
results in a loss of the PHB>AVA connection in an otherwise hermaphroditic animal and a 
gain of the PHB>AVG connection, demonstrating that the sex of PHB dictates which 
connection is pruned or maintained. Non-dimorphic PHB connectivity at the L1 stage is not 
affected by sex-reversal (Extended Data Fig. 8). Notably, masculinization of PHB also 
restores the behavioral defects of head sensory neuron-disabled hermaphrodites (Fig. 2a). 
Thus, the behavioral differences between males and hermaphrodites in the noxious chemical 
response can be linked specifically to the sex of an individual neuron (Fig. 2).
Not only is the sex of the presynaptic neuron a determinant of sex-specific wiring patterns, 
but the postsynaptic cell is also important for establishing proper connectivity (Fig. 4). 
Masculinization of AVG in hermaphrodites (in which PHB does not normally connect to 
AVG) will now maintain the PHB>AVG connection. Similarly, masculinization of AVA 
disrupts maintenance of the PHB>AVA synapses in hermaphrodites (Fig. 4).
Feminizing neurons cell-autonomously via expression of TRA-2IC, in otherwise male 
animals generally produced the converse effects (Fig. 4). For example, feminization of the 
PHB neurons in male animals is sufficient to maintain the normally hermaphrodite-specific 
PHB>AVA synapse and prune the normally male-specific PHB>AVG synapses (Fig. 4). 
These ectopic PHB>AVA synapses seem to be functional, as tax-4 males with feminized 
PHBs reverse less and can antagonize the SDS response (Fig. 2a).
We further probed the non-autonomous nature of maintaining sex-specific synapses by 
asking whether the maintenance of the PHB>AVG synapse in hermaphrodites through 
masculinization of AVG, will impact on the maintenance of the hermaphrodite-specific 
PHB>AVA synapse. Indeed, in animals in which fem-3 is driven in AVG (resulting in 
stabilization of the PHB>AVG synapse), PHB>AVA synapse number is significantly 
reduced. Conversely, in hermaphrodites, in which we masculinized AVA, the PHB>AVA 
synapse is not only pruned, but the PHB>AVG is now stabilized (Fig. 4). These results 
suggest a competition mechanism in which one synaptic wiring configuration is maintained 
on the expense of the “alternative” wiring pattern.
Doublesex-like transcription factors control dimorphic connectivity
What is the link between the globally-acting sex determination system, mediated by TRA-1, 
and synaptic pruning? A recently framed hypothesis posits that globally-acting hormonal 
signals in vertebrates operate through region-specific, modular effector system21. In C. 
elegans, the global TRA-1 regulator may operate in a cell-type specific manner through one 
of the 11 members of the DMD (“Doublesex/MAB-3 domain”) family of transcription 
factors, which are conserved regulators of sexual identity in various organisms22. Three of 
these family members (mab-3, mab-23, dmd-3) have previously been implicated in somatic 
sex differences4, but the other eight have remained uncharacterized so far. We found that 
dmd-5 and dmd-11 are dimorphically expressed in the dimorphically connected AVG neuron 
described above; expression is observed in male AVG, but not in hermaphrodite AVG (Fig. 
5a). This dimorphic expression is controlled cell-autonomously via the canonical sex-
determination pathway and TRA-1, since expression of FEM-3, the negative regulator of

 hermaphroditic TRA-1 protein, in the AVG neurons derepresses dmd-5 and dmd-11 
expression in the AVG neurons of hermaphrodites (Fig. 5a and Extended Data Fig. 9a).
dmd-5 and dmd-11 single mutants show defects in the male-specific function of AVG in 
mating behavior (Fig. 5b and Extended Data Fig. 9f–h) and dmd-5; dmd-11 double mutant 
animals show even stronger defects (Fig. 5b). These defects can be rescued by AVG-specific 
expression of either dmd-5 or dmd-11 (Fig. 5b). Moreover, dmd-5 single mutants and 
dmd-5; dmd-11 double mutants display the alterations in AVG synaptic wiring that one 
would expect from factors that control the sexually dimorphic nature of AVG wiring (Fig. 
5c–d; Extended Data Fig. 9). Male-specific PHB>AVG synapses fail to be maintained in 
dmd-5; dmd-11 mutant males. Synaptic defects can be rescued through AVG-specific 
expression of dmd-5 (Fig. 5c–d). There are no synaptic defects observed in the L1 stage of 
dmd-5; dmd-11 mutants when no synaptic dimorphism is yet apparent (Extended Data Fig. 
9b), indicating that dmd-5/11 are not required for synapse formation per se, but are 
specifically involved in controlling sex-specific synapse maintenance by preventing synaptic 
pruning, as predicted by their expression pattern. Furthermore, the PHB>AVA 
hermaphroditic connection is non-autonomously stabilized in dmd-5; dmd-11 mutant males, 
supporting the competition model discussed above (Extended Data Fig. 9e).
dmd-5 is not only required but also sufficient to prevent synaptic pruning, as deduced by 
ectopic dmd-5 expression in the AVG neurons of hermaphrodites. In these animals the 
PHB>AVG synapses are now maintained (Fig. 5d). Since DMD proteins are generally 
thought to work as repressors22, we propose that dmd-5, in conjunction with dmd-11, 
represses the expression of gene(s) in male AVG neurons that are involved in the pruning of 
AVG’s connections to PHB and that repression of these pruning factor(s) in hermaphroditic 
AVG, via ectopic dmd-5 expression, inhibits pruning (summarized in Extended Data Fig. 
9j). Notably, while AVG-masculinized dmd-5(+) hermaphrodites (masculinized through 
fem-3 driven degradation of TRA-1) do maintain PHB>AVG synapses, AVG-masculinized 
dmd-5(−) hermaphrodites do not (Fig. 5d, Extended Data Fig. 9d). This demonstrates that 
dmd-5 functions downstream of tra-1, as already suggested by the observation of ectopic 
dmd-5 expression in animals in which we degraded TRA-1 cell-autonomously in AVG (see 
above; Fig. 5a and Extended Data Fig. 9a).
In conclusion, our studies show how sex-shared neurons adopt sex-specific synaptic wiring 
patterns. Sex-specific wiring patterns arise in a neuron-type specific manner. In most cases, 
we observe sexual maturation-coupled, sex-specific pruning of synaptic connections that 
were indiscriminately generated in both sexes. In at least one case, sex-specific synapses are 
pre-patterned before overt sexual maturation of the animal. We observed striking patterns of 
cellular autonomy of the synaptic pruning events and we found pruning to be regulated by 
sex-specifically expressed transcription factors.

Microscopy
Worms were anesthetized using 100mM of sodium azide (NaN3) and mounted on 5% agar 
on glass slides. Worms were analyzed by Nomarski optics and fluorescence microscopy, 
using a Zeiss 780 confocal laser-scanning microscope. When using GFP, we estimated the 
resolution of our confocal to be ~250 nm. Multidimensional data was reconstructed as 
maximum intensity projections using Zeiss Zen software. Puncta were quantified by 
scanning the original full Z-stack for distinct dots in the area where the processes of the two 
neurons overlap. Figures were prepared using Adobe Photoshop CS6 and Adobe Illustrator 
CS6.
Cell ablation
We performed laser ablations using a MicroPoint Laser System Basic Unit (N2 pulsed laser 
(dye pump), ANDOR Technology) attached to a Zeiss Axioplan 2IE widefield microscope 
(Objective EC Plan-Neofluar 100×/1.30 Oil M27). This laser delivers 120 µJoules of 337 nm 
energy with a 3 nsec pulse length. Ablations were done as previously described 34, with 
pulse repetition rates ~ 15 Hz. Cell identification was done with a GFP or Cherry markers. 
Ablations were performed at the L4 stage, and worms were analyzed 24–48 hours later. 
Mock animals were placed on same slide under microscope but were not ablated, and were 
allowed to recover in a similar manner. After relevant assays were performed (tracking or 
mating assays), worms were mounted again on glass slides and analyzed under microscope 
to validate that cell-ablation was successful.
Mating behavior assays
Mating assays were based on procedures described previously 12,35. Males were picked at an 
early L4 stage and kept apart from hermaphrodites for 24 hours. One male was transferred to 
a plate covered with a thin fresh OP50 lawn containing 10–15 adult unc-31(e928) 
hermaphrodites. These hermaphrodites move very little, allowing for an easy recording of 
male behavior. Hermaphrodites were also isolated from opposite sex at the L4 stage and 
used 24 hours later. Animals were monitored and sequence of events was recorded within a 
15 min window or until the male ejaculated, whichever occurred first. Males were tested for 
their ability to locate vulva in a mating assay, calculated as location efficiency (L.E.)36. The 
number of passes or hesitations at the vulva until the male first stops at the vulva were 
counted. Location Efficiency = 1 / # encounters to stop. PHB silenced males were digitally

 recorded using the Exo Labs model 1 camera mounted on Nikon Eclipse E400 compound 
microscope with long-distance X20 lenses. These videos were analyzed for vulva location 
efficiency and % of successful contact response, which requires tail apposition and initiation 
of backward locomotion. % response to contact = 100x [the number of times a male 
exhibited contact response/the number of times the male makes contact with a 
hermaphrodite via the rays13.
SDS-avoidance behavior
SDS avoidance assay was based on procedures described previously 10. A small drop of 
solution containing either the repellent (0.1% SDS in M13 buffer) or buffer (M13 buffer: 30 
mM Tris-HCl pH 7.0, 100 mM NaCl, 10 mM KCl) is delivered near the tail of an animal 
while it moves forward. Once in contact with the tail, the drop surrounds the entire animal 
by capillary action and reaches the anterior amphid sensory organs. Drop was delivered 
using 10 µl glass calibrated pipets (VWR international) pulled by hand on a flame to reduce 
the diameter of the tip. The capillary pipette was mounted in a holder with rubber tubing and 
operated by mouth. Assayed worms were transferred to fresh non-wet unseeded NGM plates 
and allowed to rest at room temp for a few minutes. Each assayed started with testing the 
animals with drops of buffer alone. The response to each drop was scored as reversing or not 
reversing. The avoidance index is the number of reversal responses divided by the total 
number of trials. An Inter Stimuli Interval of at least two minutes was used between 
successive drops to the same animal. Each animal was tested at least 10 times. The L1 
animals were scored blindly and sex was noted 48 hr later.
Neuronal silencing using the histamine chloride channel 1 (HisCl1) system
ASH::HisCl1 (kyEx5104), PHBp::HisCl1 (otEx6341), PHBp::HisCl1; tax-4(p678) and 
ASH::HisCl1; PHBp::HisCl1 transgenic animals were picked at the L4 stage and placed on 
NGM plates containing 10mM histamine with OP50 bacteria as food source. As a control, 
animals were placed on NGM plates containing OP50 bacteria but no histamine. 
Chemorepulsion behavior assays were performed 24 hours later. Histamine plates were 
prepared as previously described 37. As additional controls, pan-neural HisCl1 transgenic 
worms (CX14373 kyEx4571 [pNP403 (tag-168::HisCl1::SL2::GFP), myo-3::mCherry], a 
kind gift from Cori Bargmann) were placed on Histamine plates prior to use and the time 
until worm paralysis was measured. Wild-type worms were analyzed on histamine plates 
and no changes were observed from animals analyzed on non-histamine plates.
Automatic worm tracking
Hermaphrodite and male transgenic otIs462 animals were ablated at the L4 stage and left to 
recover for 24 hours before tracking. PHB silenced hermaphrodites and males were 
transferred into NGM plates containing 10mM histamine for 24 hours before tracking. At 
the adult stage animals were placed on an NGM plate seeded with diluted 20 µl of OP50 
bacteria in the center. As a control, mock ablated transgenic otIs462 animals were used. 
Automatic tracking was performed at ~ 22°C (room temperature) with Worm Tracker 2.0 
(WT2), which uses a mobile camera to track and record individual worms and 5 min videos 
were generated. Analysis of the tracking videos was performed as previously described 14.

 To assess the effect of LUA ablation, we first conducted a pilot tracking study of LUA-
ablated hermaphrodites worms versus controls and LUA-ablated males versus controls. Due 
to the extensive analysis of the tracking system, 702 features were initially measured. After 
correction for multiple testing, pausing and pausing-related features emerged as the main, 
significant difference between LUA-ablated males and hermaphrodites. Therefore, to obviate 
further heavy corrections for multiple testing, we chose to re-run these experiments, this 
time only measuring pausing, permitting us to use of the uncorrected p-value. Within this 
subset of new experiments, wherein only 1 feature was measured (i.e., pausing), we found 
highly significant p-values. Given the necessity of 4 tests to make the proof, we chose the 
most conservative correction possible for multiple testing, Bonferroni, to illustrate that the p-
values measured maintain significance even after such extreme correction.
Analysis of EM data
Original TEM serial electron micrographs from “JSE” hermaphrodite tail series and “N2Y” 
male tail series were analyzed using Elegance software 38.
Images were aligned and screened for adjacency of neuronal processes of the pairs of cells 
described in this manuscript. For JSE, images from “PAG” and “red series” were analyzed, 
and for N2Y PAG images were analyzed.

generally note that the number of synapses is roughly reproducible from animal to animal

identified by the EM analysis. However, there is also some variance from animal to animal 
(quantified in Fig. 3), consistent with previous analysis 40.

 computed across all measures (roughly 1404 tests) using the Benjamini–Hochberg 
procedure.
b: Silencing of ASH neuronal activity using the histamine chloride channel 1(HisCl1) 
affects the animals’ chemosensory avoidance response.
Males and hermaphrodites were assayed for affects of histamine on SDS avoidance 
behavior. We used the him-5 mutant background (which gives a high incidence of male 
progeny) as wild type. There is no difference between worms assayed in the presence and 
absence of histamine (Fig. 2a). The avoidance index of single animals was calculated as the 
fraction of reversal responses in 10 or more assays, depicted as black dots. Magenta vertical 
bars represent the median.
L4 animals carrying the kyEx5104 [pNP424 (sra-6::HisCl1::SL2::mCherry)]9 transgene 
were grown on 10mM histamine-containing NGM plates for 24 hours. As a control, 
kyEx5104 animals were grown on NGM plates without histamine. ASH silencing reduces 
the head sensory response to SDS, thus in hermaphrodites the antagonizing activity of the 
PHBs inhibits the backward movement and the worms do not reverse. In males, no such 
antagonizing activity occurs and the worms reverse, albeit with reduced ability.
c: Ablation of ASH neurons affects the animals’ chemosensory avoidance response in a 
similar manner to histamine-induced silencing. sra-6::gfp was used to identify the ASH 
neurons.
d: Behavioral differences stem from dimorphic connectivity differences and not from 
amphid/ phasmid sensory function. tax-4; ceh-14 double mutants behave in a similar manner 
in both sexes. PHB silencing (gpa-6::HisCl1::SL2::GFP) doesn’t affect the worms behavior 
in both sexes. Silencing both the ASHs and PHBs in males showed no difference from ASH 
silenced males, but silencing ASHs and PHBs in hermaphrodites showed a significant 
difference from ASH silenced hermaphrodites, where we expect the PHBs to function in an 
antagonistic manner, and thus in its absence, ASH silenced hermaphrodites now show an 
increase in their ability to respond to SDS by reversing.
e: PHB silencing in tax-4 mutant background. tax-4 is a subunit of a cyclic nucleotide gated 
channel expressed in chemosensory and thermosensory neurons 42, see panel g, tax-4 
animals show a strongly reduced avoidance response to SDS 10. Silencing of PHBs in tax-4 
hermaphrodies eliminated the antagonizing affect and animals are able to avoide SDS by 
backing.
f: PHB silencing in tax-4 mutant background at the L1 stage. Lack of avoidance seen in 
tax-4 L1 males and hermaphrodites depends on PHB function.
For all panels, we performed the nonparametric Mann-Whitney test with Bonferroni 
correction for multiple comparisons. ****P < 0.0001, **P < 0.01, *P < 0.05, NS; non 
significant.
g:tax-4 expression pattern is identical in hermaphrodites and males. kyEx744 
(tax-4p::TAX-4::GFP)42, was analyzed in adult male and hermaphrodites. Amphid neurons 
in the head (ADL, ASH, ASI, ASJ, ASK, AWB) were stained using DiD to facilitate cell 
identification. Neurons identified, shown in “Merge” panel are identical in both sexes and 
match published data. All neurons are bilaterally symmetric left-right pairs, and for 
simplicity only left cells are shown. Scale bars are 10 µM.

project”43gk408945 is a missense substitution mutation of W54 to R, located in the second 
exon. Genomic analysis revealed that this mutation lies within the conserved DM domain

test. ****P < 0.0001, ***P < 0.001, *P < 0.05, NS; Not significant. Magenta horizontal bars

for the LUA>AVG synapse between dmd-5;dmd-11 mutant hermaphrodites and 
dmd-5;dmd-11 mutant hermaphrodites that over express DMD-5 (*P < 0.05).
j: Summary of data. TRA-1 and DMD proteins are commonly thought to work as 
transcriptional repressors 22. Since dmd-5/11 are already dimorphically expressed in AVG in 
embryos and L1 stage animals (not shown in this schematic), there must be other timer 
mechanisms that control the onset of pruning. For example, DMD-5/11 may work together 
with a regulatory factor of the stage-specifically acting heterochronic pathway. Furthermore, 
we hypothesize that other neurons, such as the AVA neuron, may have its own complement 
of sex-specific dmd genes that control pruning.

a: Connectivity of selected neurons at the adult stage, as inferred from serial section 
reconstructions of electron micrographs3. Chemical synapses between sensory (triangles), 
inter- (hexagons) and motor (circles) neurons are depicted as arrows. Thickness of arrows 
correlates with degree of connectivity (number of sections over which en passant synapses 
are observed). The inset indicates where synaptic connections are formed.
