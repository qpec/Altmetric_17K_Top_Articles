for Adults With Type 1 and
Insulin-Treated Type 2 Diabetes
and Problematic Hypoglycemia:
A Cluster Randomized
Controlled Trial
Diabetes Care 2016;39:2190–2196 | DOI: 10.2337/dc16-1614
OBJECTIVE
To establish the effectiveness of a brief, partly web-based group intervention,
HypoAware, in patients with problematic hypoglycemia, in terms of the reduc-
tion of severe hypoglycemic episodes, impaired hypoglycemia awareness, and
worries.
RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS
A two-arm, cluster randomized controlled trial was conducted in insulin-treated
patients with problematichypoglycemia ineight Dutchclinics comparing HypoAware
with care as usual. Primary outcomes included self-reported severe hypoglyce-
mia, impaired hypoglycemia awareness (Gold score), and worries and distress
about hypoglycemia (Hypoglycemia Fear Survey-II/Problem Areas In Diabetes
scale hypo-item), assessed at baseline, and at 2, 4, and 6 months of follow-up.
We used t tests, nonparametric tests, and intention-to-treat generalized
estimation equation (GEE) analyses with linear, logistic, and Poisson or negative
binomial models.
RESULTS
We enrolled 137 participants. Adjusted GEE analyses over four time points showed
a nonsignificant 33% fewer episodes of severe hypoglycemia in the HypoAware
group compared with the control group (relative risk [RR] 0.67 [95% CI 0.39–1.16],
P = 0.150); a significant reduced odds of impaired awareness (odds ratio 0.38 [95%
CI 0.15–0.95], P = 0.038), a trend toward 20% fewer worries about hypoglycemia
(RR 0.80 [95% CI 0.64–1.01], P = 0.059), and a significant 30% less hypo-distress (RR
0.70 [95% CI 0.56–0.88], P = 0.002). Over the 6-month study duration, participants
experienced a median of 2.5 events of severe hypoglycemia (interquartile range
[IQR] 1–10) in the control condition versus 1 event (IQR 0–6.5) in the HypoAware
group (P = 0.030). There was no significant change in HbA1c level within and be-
tween both groups.
CONCLUSIONS
HypoAware resulted in fewer severe hypoglycemic episodes, significantly im-
proved hypoglycemia awareness, and less hypo-distress in comparison with usual
care, and deserves further dissemination.

PSYCHOSOCIAL RESEARCH AND CARE IN DIABETES
 Severe hypoglycemia, defined as a low
blood glucose level where there is a
need of external assistance due to con-
fusion, muscle weakness, or loss of con-
sciousness, is one of the most impactful
adverse events associated with insulin
treatment in type 1 diabetes (T1D) and
type 2 diabetes (T2D) (1). Severe hypo-
glycemia can lead to significant morbid-
ity, fear of hypoglycemia, reduced quality
of life, and even death (1–4), as well as to
high societal costs in terms of increased
health care consumption and reduced
work productivity (2,5). The estimated in-
cidence of severe hypoglycemia ranges
from 1.0 to 1.7 episodes/patient/year
and occurs in 30–37% of people with
T1D (6–8). Longer disease duration in-
creases the risk of severe hypoglycemia
to 3.2 episodes/patient/year (9). With
progressiveinsulindeficiency,thefrequency
of severe hypoglycemia in people with T2D
approaches that of T1D (10). In people
with diabetes who show hypoglycemia-
associated autonomic failure, a defect
associated withimpairedsymptomaware-
ness, the risk of severe hypoglycemia is
found to be 25-fold greater (1,11). Re-
current hypoglycemic episodes reduce
hormonal counter-regulation, thereby
increasing the risk for subsequent hypo-
glycemia, leading to a vicious cycle of
events (11). There is evidence that psy-
chobehavioral factors, like inattention
for symptoms of hypoglycemia, misinter-
pretation, and the postponement of cor-
rective measures, are at least partly
responsible for an increased risk of severe
hypoglycemia (12). Hypoglycemia-specific
structured psychoeducational interven-
tions have been developed, such as Blood
Glucose Awareness Training (BGAT), that
are aimed at helping patients enhance
their understanding of risk factors for
hypoglycemia, and improve symptom
awareness, as well as adequate andtimely
corrective behaviors (13). A recent review
and meta-analysis (14) showed the effec-
tiveness of psychoeducational programs
in terms of improving symptom aware-
ness. However, because of methodological
limitations more rigorous trials are needed
(S.M.P.A.R.,M.d.W.,F.J.S.,M.W.vanTulder,
J.C.F. Ket, W.H.J.J. Cleijne, unpublished
observations). Moreover, the use of the
Internet can help to lower the burden of
such programs on the resources of clinics,
health care professionals’ time, and people
with diabetes,andtherebyenhanceoppor-
tunities for dissemination (15).
Wedevelopedabrief,partlyweb-based
psychoeducational group intervention for
people with problematic hypoglycemia
called HypoAware(inDutch:HypoBewust)
based on key active ingredients of the
evidence-based BGAT, and demonstrated
its feasibility and acceptability in a pilot
study (15).
This study aims to evaluate the effec-
tiveness of HypoAware in reducing epi-
sodes of severe hypoglycemia, and
improving hypoglycemia awareness
and hypoglycemia-related distress in
people with T1D and insulin-treated
T2D compared with usual care.
RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS
Design
We performed a two-arm, multicenter,
cluster randomized controlled trial with
follow-up measurements at 2 months
(4 weeks postintervention), 4 months,
and 6 months. A detailed description of
the study protocol is provided elsewhere
(16).ThestudywasapprovedbytheEthics
Committee of the VU University Medical
Center certified by the Central Committee
on Research involving Human Subjects in
the Netherlands (NL47354.029.13, regis-
tration no. 2014.007). We obtained writ-
teninformed consentfromallparticipants.
Randomization
Cluster randomization was performed
prior to the recruitment of participants
at the level of the participating clinics to
avoid contamination within the clinics.
Random allocation was performed by
two members of the study team, who
randomly selected notes from two opa-
que envelopes, one with the eight names
of the clinics and one with four notes with
“intervention” and four notes with “con-
trol.” Participants were allocated based
on the clinic where they were registered.
Setting and Subjects
The study was performed in eight outpa-
tient diabetes clinics in the Netherlands.
After baseline measurement, participants
were enrolled in HypoAware or received
usual care for 6 months, depending on
the clinic at which they were registered.
Blinding of participants and health care
professionals was not possible because
of the nature of the intervention.
Persons were eligible for this study if
they were $18 years of age, were treat-
ed for T1D or T2D in an outpatient set-
ting, performed at least three multiple
daily insulin injections a day or used
continuous subcutaneousinsulininfusion
(pump therapy), and had experienced
one or more episodes of severe hypogly-
cemia in the past 2 years and/or had a
heightened risk of severe hypoglycemia
operationalized by subjective impaired
awareness of hypoglycemia (no or signif-
icantly reduced autonomic symptoms
when the blood glucose level drops be-
low 4 mmol/L (72 mg/dL), as defined by
Gold et al. [17]). Furthermore, patients
had to have access to the Internet, and
be willing and able to attend the three
group meetings.
Patients were excluded from participa-
tion when they met one or more of the
following exclusion criteria: serious med-
ical comorbidity (e.g., cancer or dialysis);
a major psychiatric disorder (e.g., bipolar
depression or schizophrenia); established
cognitive impairment; substance abuse;
pregnancy; and insufficient Dutch lan-
guage skills or visual impairments.
Interventions
HypoAware
HypoAware is an adapted version of
Dutch BGAT (18), and was developed
in close collaboration with diabetes ex-
perts with experience in BGAT and per-
sons with diabetes. It consists of three
group sessions of 2.5 h over 4 weeks,
combined with two user-friendly online
modules in the weeks between meet-
ings. Groups consist of eight participants
and are led by two trained diabetes pro-
fessionals. HypoAware is guided by the
biopsychobehavioral model of risk of se-
vere hypoglycemia by Gonder-Frederick
et al. (12), and aims to improve symptom
recognition, risk awareness, preventive
and problem-solving strategies, and cop-
ing with (the risk of) hypoglycemia. Topics
covered in the group meetings and online
are presented in Supplementary Table 1.
Group sessions are highly interactive
and aimed at patient empowerment, in
which patient responsibility and informed
decision-making is encouraged (when ap-
propriate). Partners or significant others
are invited to the third session. More in-
formation about the development and
feasibility of HypoAware is published
elsewhere (15).
ControldCare as Usual
Participants in the care as usual (CAU)
group had access to comprehensive di-
abetes care as normally provided by
their diabetes team (also available to
theparticipantsoftheinterventiongroup).

 After 6 months of follow-up, our study
team trained the diabetes care teams
from the control group, and participants
from the control group received the inter-
vention, if they so wished.
Outcomes
All measures mentioned below, unless
otherwise mentioned, were administered
web-based at baseline, and at 2, 4, and
6 months of follow-up. Clinical data were
collected from the medical files.
Primary Outcomes
c Episodes of severe hypoglycemia, de-
fined as “a hypoglycemic event serious
enough to require the help of another
person” (self-report). We asked about
the number of events occurring over
the past 6 months at baseline, and
over the past 2 months at all follow-
up measurements.
c Hypoglycemia awareness was evalu-
ated using the validated Gold score
(17). The Gold score consists of one
item on a Likert scale, ranging from
1 (“always aware”) to 7 (“always un-
aware”). A score of $4 indicates im-
paired hypoglycemia awareness.
c Fear of hypoglycemia was measured us-
ing the revised Hypoglycemia Fear Sur-
vey(HFS-II)with33itemsona0–4Likert
scale (19). Higher values indicate more
worries (18 items) or hypoglycemia-
related avoidance behaviors (15 items).
Secondary Outcomes
c Episodes of nonsevere hypoglycemia in
the past week, defined as “a hypogly-
cemic event not serious enough to re-
quire the help of another person.” We
asked participants to count the num-
ber of blood glucose measurements in
the past week that were ,4 mmol/L
(,72mg/dL),andaskedthemhowmany
times they had felt low and treated
their blood glucose level with carbohy-
drates without confirming the level
with a test.
c Diabetes-related distress was assessed
with the short-form Problem Areas In
Diabetes scale (PAID-5) (20). This scale
consists of five items on a Likert scale
(0–4). A higher score means more
diabetes-related distress. A score of $8
indicates elevated diabetes-related
distress. We added one item from the
PAID-20, “Worrying about low blood
glucose reactions” with scores of 3
and 4 (“somewhat serious problem”
and “serious problem,” respectively),
indicating high hypoglycemia-related
distress.
c Anxiety and depression were assessed
with the Hospital Anxiety and Depres-
sion Scale (HADS) (21). Higher scores
indicate more symptom burden of anx-
iety and depression. Scores forthe sub-
scalesfor anxiety anddepression of,8
are considered to be normal, scores
between 8 and 10 indicate borderline
anxiety or depression, and scores be-
tween 11 and 21 indicate elevated anx-
iety or depression.
c Diabetes-specificself-efficacywaseval-
uated with the Confidence In Diabetes
Self-care (CIDS) scale with 21 items
(Likert scale 1–5) (22). Sum scores are
transformed to 0–100. Higher scores
indicate more overall diabetes-specific
self-efficacy.
c Health-related quality of life was mea-
sured using the EuroQol 5-dimensional
5-level version (EQ-5D-5 L) and the vi-
sual analog scale (EQ-5D VAS) (23).
Scores of the EQ-5D-5 L lie between
0 and 1, with higher scores indicating a
better health-related quality of life.
The scores of the EQ5D-VAS lie be-
tween 0 and 100, with a higher score
indicating a higher subjective health
status.
c The most recently determined glyco-
sylated hemoglobin (HbA1c) was col-
lected from the medical file before
enrollment in the study and around
the time of the 6-month follow-up.
Other clinical data and demographics
were only collected at baseline, as fol-
lows: type of diabetes, treatment regi-
men, diabetes duration, diabetes-related
complications, lifetime severe hypoglyce-
mic events, and comorbidities.
We assessed the number of group
meetings attended via contact with the
trainers after every group meeting and
the number of online modules com-
pleted via the back end of the online
environment. A minimum of two of three
meetings and two of two modules are
considered essential to obtain benefit
from the intervention.
Statistical Analyses
Power calculation was based on the Euro-
pean BGAT intervention study (24). We
aimed to detect a difference of 0.94 epi-
sodes of severe hypoglycemia/6 months
(1.07 6 2.85 for the control group vs.
0.13 6 0.33 for the BGAT group at the
6-month follow-up) between the two
groups, with three follow-up measure-
ments with an assumed correlation of
0.6, the a set at 0.05, a power of 80%,
and adjusting for clustering within eight
diabetes teams with an intraclass cor-
relation of 0.01, as described by Twisk
(25). Based on the power calculation,
we needed to include 124 participants.
Differences between study partici-
pants and dropouts, the median number
of events of severe hypoglycemia during
the study, the percentage of persons af-
fected with one or more events of hypo-
glycemia during the study, and an HbA1c
level between baseline and the 6-month
follow-up were compared with Student
t tests, Mann-Whitney U test, and x2
test with SPSS Statistics for Windows
version 22.0 (IBM, Armonk, NY).
Primary and secondary outcome data
were analyzed based on the intention-
to-treat principle. Because we did not
find between-clinic differences, it was
not necessary to use multilevel model-
ing. Because of the repeated measure-
ments, statistical analysis was performed
using generalized estimation equations
(GEEs) with Stata Statistical Software for
Windows release 11.2 (Stata corporation,
College Station, Texas). The GEE is a lon-
gitudinal technique, which takes into
account that observations can be corre-
lated. We used a linear model for contin-
uous outcomes, a logistic model for
dichotomous outcomes, and a Poisson
or negative binomial model for count
outcomes. In case of skewed continuous
data, linear GEE analysis was performed
after log transformation. Besides the
crude analysis(only adjusted for thebase-
line value of the particular outcome), two
adjusted analyses were performed; one
adjusted for demographics (sex, age,
and education level) and one adjusted
for diabetes-related characteristics (epi-
sodes of severe hypoglycemia in the pre-
vious 2 years, diabetes duration, diabetes
treatment method, HbA1c level, and cur-
rent use of real-time continuous glu-
cose monitoring [RT-CGM]). A P value of
#0.05 was considered to be statistically
significant.
RESULTS
The baseline measurement was com-
pleted by 137 participants (Table 1). We
have no record of the total number of
patients reached by the local diabetes
care teams. Participants were on average
2192

 52 6 13 years old and almost evenly dis-
tributed across sex (46% female). A total
of 88% of all participants had type 1 di-
abetes (n = 121), the mean HbA1c level
was 60.7 6 11.6 mmol/mol (7.7 6
1.1%), the mean duration of diabetes
was 26 6 13.6 years, and 42% of partici-
pants had one or more diabetes compli-
cations (n = 57). Following the criteria of
Gold et al. (17), 76% of participants had
impaired hypoglycemia awareness (n =
104); patients reported a median of two
episodes of severe hypoglycemia in the
past 6 months (interquartile range [IQR]
0–5). Besides the number of nonsevere
hypoglycemic episodes (P = 0.011), there
were no further statistically significant
differences after clinical randomization
at baseline.
Participant flow is depicted in the
CONSORT diagram (Fig. 1). Nineteen
participants dropped out of the study at
the 6-month follow-up (14%; n = 13 inter-
vention group, n = 6 control group). Drop-
outs were younger (46 vs. 53 years old, P =
0.018), had a lower level of education
(47 vs. 25%, P = 0.024), had a shorter du-
ration of diabetes (19 vs. 27 years, P =
0.015), had a higher HbA1c level (66 vs.
60 mmol/L, P = 0.032), and were more
often female (68 vs. 42%, P = 0.034) than
participants who remained in the study.
Table 2 shows the crude and adjusted
results of the GEE analyses, using 499
data points (9% of participants were miss-
ing data points; n = 250 intervention
group, n = 249 control group) from four
measurements in 6 months (Fig. 1).
Primary Outcomes
Taking into account the four time points,
and adjusting for baseline numbers and
demographic and diabetes-related vari-
ables, the GEE analyses showed a non-
significant 33% reduction in episodes of
severe hypoglycemia in the HypoAware
group compared with the CAU group
(relative risk [RR] 0.67 [95% CI 0.39–
1.16], P = 0.150). Looking at the propor-
tion of participants with impaired
awareness versus those with no im-
paired awareness, as defined by Gold
et al. (17), HypoAware resulted in signif-
icantly reduced odds of impaired aware-
ness (odds ratio [OR] 0.38 [95% CI 0.15–
0.95], P = 0.038). Participants in the
HypoAware group experienced a signif-
icant drop of 30% in distress concerning
hypoglycemia, as measured with the
PAID item (RR 0.70 [95% CI 0.56–0.88],
P = 0.002) and a borderline significant
20% reduction in worries, as measured
with the Worry scale of the HFS-II (RR
0.80 [95% CI 0.64–1.01], P = 0.059).
Comparing the median number of se-
vere hypoglycemic events during the
course of the study (T1–T3, covering
6 months) with an independent-samples
Mann-Whitney U test, we found a sig-
nificant difference between the groups,
as follows: a median of 2.5 severe hypo-
glycemic events/6 months (IQR 1–10) in
the CAU condition versus 1 severe hypo-
glycemic event/6 months (IQR 0–6.5) in
the HypoAware group (P = 0.030). The
groups also differed in the proportion of
participants affected by one or more
events of severe hypoglycemia during
the study, with 79% for the CAU group
and 53% for the intervention group
(Pearson x2 test, P = 0.003).
Secondary Outcomes
There were 18% more episodes of non-
severe hypoglycemia reported in the
HypoAware group relative to the CAU
group, but this was not significant (RR
1.18 [95% CI 0.90–1.53], P = 0.231).
Change in HbA1c levels between base-
line and the 6-month follow-up did not
differ significantly between the groups
(mean difference 22.3 mmol/mol [95%
CI 25.1 to 20.5], P = 0.101). HbA1c con-
centration dropped 2.4 mmol/mol in the
control group versus 0.1 mmol/mol in the
intervention group. We found no signifi-
cant differences in diabetes distress
(PAID), CIDS scale score, symptoms of
anxiety and depression (HADS), and
health-related quality of life (EQ5-D) be-
tween the HypoAware and CAU groups
(Table 2).

CONCLUSIONS
This study demonstrated that parti-
cipants who received treatment with
HypoAware showed better hypoglycemia-
related and psychological outcomes
than participants in the CAU group, al-
though findings were not all statistically
significant. The results corroborate ear-
lier BGAT findings (13), although we re-
duced the number of sessions by more
than half, and substituted a fair amount
of content by Internet modules. More-
over, we observed good program adher-
ence, with 96% participating in two or
more sessions (of three), and 90% com-
pleting the two online sessions.
The improvement in hypoglycemia
awareness could be considered the most
direct effect of the intervention. We saw
38% odds of reduced impaired hypogly-
cemia awareness in the HypoAware
group compared with the control group.
Improved symptom awareness is key to
preventing severe hypoglycemia in the
absence of RT-CGM and is probably re-
sponsible for the finding that participants
receiving treatment with HypoAware
reported 18% more events of nonse-
vere hypoglycemia than participants re-
ceiving CAU. Importantly, an increase in
nonsevere hypoglycemia events in the
intervention group did not translate
into more worries. In contrast, we
found a trend toward lower hypoglyce-
mia-related distress in the intervention

 group, and that HbA1c levels did not de-
teriorate. These findings suggest im-
proved self-management following the
HypoAware intervention.
The absolute number of severe hypo-
glycemia events over the course of our
study period of 6 months was signifi-
cantly different between the two
groups. When adjusting for diabetes-re-
lated and demographic variables, the
33% risk reduction for severe hypogly-
cemia in the HypoAware group was not
statistically significant. If we translate
our findings in terms of numbers
needed to treat, 0.7 patient needs to
be exposed to HypoAware in order to
prevent one episode of severe hypogly-
cemia,or,asstated otherwise,11events
of severe hypoglycemia can be pre-
vented by one delivery of HypoAware.
It is important to note that the observed
reductions in severe hypoglycemia
were achieved in a sample of patients
who were not all seriously affected by
severe hypoglycemia (although most
had impaired awareness) with access
to ongoing comprehensive outpatient
diabetes care.
Interestingly, almost a quarter (24%)
of patients in the control group used
RT-CGM, compared with 8% in the
HypoAware group. We have no explana-
tion for this difference, but CGM was
not an exclusion criterion and, indeed,
is available in the Netherlands for pa-
tients with persistent, problematic dia-
betes regulation. We added RT-CGM use
as a confounder in the main analyses
and can speculate that the effects of
HypoAware are more pronouncedin a pa-
tient population without RT-CGM use be-
cause RT-CGM has been found to be
effective in preventing severe hypoglyce-
mia (26). More research is needed to
examine the role of RT-CGM and the in-
teraction with HypoAware in a larger
sample of patients with problematic hy-
poglycemia. Yeoh et al. (14) recently
proposed an algorithm for offering psy-
choeducation combined with pump ther-
apy and/or CGM to patients experiencing
recurrent hypoglycemic events, but the
evidence forusingsuch tailoredstrategies
is still lacking.
Some limitations and strengths of our
study deserve to be mentioned.
For the assessment of hypoglycemia,
we relied on self-report rather than ob-
jective glycemic data. There is, however,
evidence to support the reliability of
self-reported severe hypoglycemia (27).
The use of CGM to quantify the time
spent in hypoglycemia in future studies
is recommended.
It wasnot possible to blindpatients and
caregivers to the randomization because
of the nature of the study; however, since
both groups received treatment with
HypoAware(thecontrolgroupasanincen-
tive after the study period of 6 months),
we can assume similar expectancies in
both groups.
A follow-up period of 6 months is a
relatively short period of time to de-
monstrate a reduction in severe hypo-
glycemia, and longer-term studies are
therefore warranted. Based on previous
BGAT research, we can expect the effects
to be maintained for at least 1 year after
the intervention (28).
The strengths of this study include the
multicenter cluster randomized design,
lowering the risk of contamination; and
the testing of the intervention in a real-
life setting as an add-on to usual care in a
mixed sample of patients with type 1
and type 2 diabetes who were at risk
for severe hypoglycemia, strengthening
external validity. The highly structured
nature of the intervention (with similar
effects observed across clinics) allows
for replication studies. Alongside this
randomized controlled trial, we plan to
perform an economic evaluation. The re-
sults of this evaluation will be presented
separately.
In conclusion, HypoAware is a brief,
“blended” group and web-based psy-
choeducational intervention that helps
patients with problematic hypoglycemia
lower their risk of severe hypoglycemia,
improve their hypoglycemia awareness,
and reduce their worries about hypogly-
cemia. Further dissemination and test-
ing of the intervention in different care
settings are recommended.
