Abstract
Objective: The epidemiologic link between cesarean birth and childhood obesity is
unresolved, partly because most studies come from industrialized settings where
many post-birth factors affect the risk for obesity. We take advantage of an unusual
ethnographic situation where hospital and cesarean birth modes have recently been
introduced among Yucatec Maya subsistence farmers, but young children have had
minimal exposure to the nutritional transition. While we expect to find very low rates
of childhood obesity, we predict that cesarean-born children will be larger and heav-
ier than vaginally born children.
Methods: Weight and height were collected monthly on 108 children aged 0–5
(3576 observations total). Birth mode and birthweight were collected by maternal
interview. Data were analyzed using linear mixed models that compare child growth
[Maya population-specific Z-scores for weight-for-age and body mass index-for-age
(WAZ and BMIZ)] in cesarean and vaginally born children aged 0–5 years.
Results: The cesarean rate was 20%, no children were obese, and 5% were over-
weight. Cesarean birth was a significant predictor of child WAZ and BMIZ after
accounting for maternal effects, child birthweight, and sex. Children who were born
by cesarean to mothers with high BMI had the highest WAZ of all children by 5
years of age, and the highest BMIZ of all children at all ages.
Conclusion: Cesarean-born Maya children had higher BMI than vaginally born chil-
dren, even in the absence of many known confounding factors that contribute to
childhood obesity. Child growth was most sensitive to birth mode when mothers had
high BMI.

INTRODUCTION
Cesarean delivery and childhood obesity are epidemiologi-
cally associated in a variety of urbanized settings from high
and middle income countries in Europe and North America
as well as in Brazil, Iran, and China (Bammann et al., 2014;
Blustein et al., 2013; Goldani et al., 2013; Huh et al., 2012;
Kuhle et al., 2015; Li et al., 2012, 2013; Mueller et al., 2015;
Salehi-Abargouei et al., 2014; Steur et al., 2011; Wang et al.,
2013; Zhou et al., 2011). Yet, other studies from similar set-
tings reveal no association between cesarean birth and obe-
sity after accounting for confounding factors such as
maternal age, body size, and smoking habits, infant feeding
practices and child birthweight and sex (Ajslev et al., 2011;
Azad et al., 2014; Barros et al., 2012; Birbilis et al., 2013;
Costantine, 2014; Flemming et al., 2013; Lin et al., 2013;

nska and Rosset, 2013). This
inconsistency in the potential downstream impact of surgical
cesarean birth on childhood obesity arises in part because

 many post-birth factors, such as bottle feeding and antibiotic
use, also affect the risk for obesity (Azad et al., 2014; De Fil-
ippo et al., 2010; Kuhle et al., 2015; Ley et al., 2006; Mel-
nik, 2014; Neu and Rushing, 2011; Oddy, 2012). In
particular, the sanitary and resource-rich environments that
characterize Western societies may exacerbate the cesarean-
obesity link (Neu and Rushing, 2011). This may also be true
in non-Western or less-affluent settings where the nutritional
transition—the displacement of traditional foods by diets
high in saturated fats, sugar and refined foods and a decline
in physical activity levels—is well established or underway
(Misra and Khurana 2008; Popkin, 2004; Prentice, 2006;
Rivera, et al. 2002).
Here, we attempt to reconcile inconsistent results by
using longitudinal data to evaluate the impact of birth mode
on child growth outcomes in a population that has few of the
confounding factors that otherwise affect disproportional
weight gain in well-fed populations. The sample of young
Yucatec Maya children are breastfed, have physically active
childhoods, eat traditional diets, have minimal exposure to
market foods, and grow up in a relatively unsanitized epide-
miological environment. Although young Maya children are
relatively unexposed to many of the modernizing factors that
raise the risk of obesity, cesarean births are increasingly
prevalent in their community (Veile and Kramer, 2015). The
comparative lack of preexisting obesity-related confounders
allows us to directly observe the impact that birth mode has
on early childhood growth, particularly with respect to
weight gain. This link is critical to resolve given the signifi-
cant global increase in cesarean births and the growing con-
cern of childhood obesity as a public health issue.
In this article, we first outline the expected mechanisms
linking cesarean birth and child growth outcomes. We then
assess the rates of early childhood obesity and overweight in
our study community of Maya subsistence farmers, and use
linear mixed models (LMM) to compare child weight-for age
and body mass index (BMI) trajectories in children born vag-
inally versus by cesarean. Our goal is to demonstrate that
cesarean birth will disrupt crucial maturational processes and
increase child growth, even when few obesity-related con-
founders exist. We conclude by discussing the public health
relevance of studying the cesarean-obesity connection in
remote but modernizing subsistence communities.

BACKGROUND
Cesarean birth is associated not just with obesity but with
other negative health outcomes such as allergies (Eggesbø
et al., 2005; Laubereau et al., 2004), asthma (Debley et al.,
2005), and celiac disease (Decker et al., 2010). The biologi-
cal mechanisms underlying these associations are driven in
part by compromised maturation of the gut microbiome (the
microbe population that lives in the intestine) (Gr€
onlund
et al., 2000; Huda et al., 2014; Koenig et al., 2011; Molinaro
et al., 2012; Musso et al., 2010; Neu and Rushing, 2011).
The human gut microbiome is dominated by two bacterial
phyla (Firmicutes and Bacteroides), with smaller commun-
ities
of
Proteobacteria,
Verrumicrobia,
Actinobacteria,
Fusobacteria, and Cyanobacteria that together assist their
host with digestion, nutrient synthesis, priming of immune
cells, and protection against intestinal pathogenic coloniza-
tion (Cho and Blaser, 2012; Sommer and Backhed, 2013).
Microbial colonization of the infant gut begins at birth
following exposure to maternal fecal and vaginal microbiota
(Bäckhed et al., 2015; Dominguez-Bello et al., 2010; Mueller
et al., 2015). Because cesarean-born infants do not experi-
ence this initial exposure, their gut microbiome communities
resemble those found on the mother’s skin surface, which
have low Bacteroides populations and higher levels of
Staphylococcus spp. (Costello et al., 2012; Dominguez-Bello
et al., 2010). Cesarean-born children exhibit ongoing differ-
ences in their gut microbial profiles (including lower micro-
bial diversity relative to vaginally born children) until at least
seven years of age (Biasucci et al., 2008; Gr€
olund et al.,
1999; Kabeerdoss et al., 2013; Salminen et al., 2004). The
maturational processes of the burgeoning gut microbiome
are therefore intimately intertwined with the process of
immunological development in infancy and early childhood
(Gr€
onlund et al., 2000; Huda et al., 2014; Koenig et al.,
2011; Molinaro et al., 2012; Musso et al., 2010; Neu and
Rushing, 2011).
Compromised gut microbiota development in turn is
linked to child and adult obesity because the microbiome
plays important roles in metabolism, fat storage, and
inflammatory processes (Balamurugana et al., 2010; Ber-
voets et al., 2013; Goldani et al., 2013; Kalliomäki et al.,
2008; Neu and Rushing, 2011; Reinhardt et al., 2009;
Sweeney and Morton, 2013; Vael et al., 2011). Several ani-
mal and some human studies demonstrate differences in
the microbiome composition of obese and lean individuals;
for example, the microbiota of obese and high-fat fed mice
are characterized by greater Firmicutes and fewer Bacter-
oides bacteria than are found in lean individuals (Cani
et al., 2007; Ley et al., 2005; Murphy et al., 2010; Turn-
baugh et al., 2008, 2009). While much remains unknown
regarding the connection between human microbiomes and
obesity (Harley and Karp, 2012; Walters et al., 2014), cer-
tain alterations in human gut microbiome profiles are asso-
ciated with increased energy harvest capacity (Jumpertz
et al., 2011; Rosenbaum et al., 2015). Gut microbiota also
help to regulate inflammatory signaling pathways; systemic
low-grade inflammation is commonly associated with obe-
sity and its related pathologies in mice and humans (Cani
et al., 2007; Thompson et al., 2014).

 Despite the potential negative health consequences asso-
ciated with cesarean births, their rates are rising in most parts
of the world; in Mexico, for example, the national cesarean
birthrate is 47.5% (Vogel et al., 2015). Cesarean birth rates
have been rising in Mexico’s rural indigenous communities
since the inception of new government health programs in
the 1990s (Barber, 2009). Rural communities may even
experience cesarean birth rates that exceed the World Health
Organization (WHO) recommended maximum cesarean rate
of 15%, and even the 19% optimum rate recently published
in the Journal of the American Medical Association (Molina
et al., 2015; Veile and Kramer, 2015; WHO, 1985). Further,
in many rural indigenous Mexican populations the transition
from traditional homebirths to hospital births and rising
cesareans has been abrupt (Jordan, 1992; Veile and Kramer,
2015). This rapid and dramatic shift will inevitably influence
child health and growth patterns.
Many studies that support a cesarean birth-childhood obe-
sity link have been conducted in Westernized, affluent and
industrialized nations, where obesity is prevalent and arises
for a variety of reasons besides birth mode (Neu and Rushing,
2011, Kuhle et al., 2015). For example, high-sugar and high-
fat diets contribute to the obesity pandemic (Popkin et al.,
2012) in part due to their effect on gut microbiome composi-
tion (De Filippo et al., 2010). Bottle feeding and frequent
antibiotic consumption during infancy also modulate gut
microbiome development and are associated with obesity in
childhood and later in life (Ajslev et al., 2011; Bailey et al.,
2014; Koletzko et al., 2013). Low physical activity levels fur-
ther contribute to obesity and characterize many modernized,
urbanized and otherwise obesogenic environments (Cordain
et al., 1998; Lieberman, 2006; Popkin, 2002).
A recent meta-analysis by Kuhle et al. (2015) addressed
several of these issues. The authors analyzed results of 28
epidemiologic studies of cesarean birth and childhood obe-
sity in high and middle-income countries. They found that
cesarean birth was associated with a 34% elevated relative
risk of childhood obesity (with no difference between high
and middle-income countries), which decreased when addi-
tional early life obesity-related confounders were accounted
for. However, the study populations (including those from
middle income countries) were largely drawn from urban set-
tings (Barros et al., 2012; Goldani et al., 2013; Li, 2008, Li
et al., 2012; Lin et al. 2013; Rathnayake et al., 2013; Salehi-
Abargouei et al., 2014; Zhou et al., 2011), where the nutri-
tional transition is underway. In these settings, early life
dietary influences and activity patterns may obscure the rela-
tionship between cesareans and childhood obesity.
To unravel the effects that cesarean birth has in the
absence of many obesity-related confounders, we take
advantage of a large longitudinal database of monthly meas-
urements from birth to age five from a population of tradi-
tional Maya where young children have had minimal
exposure to the nutritional transition. We expect to find very
low rates of childhood obesity in this population. However,
if cesarean birth is an important factor in the risk of obesity,
we predict that differences in children’s weight and BMI will
vary with birth mode and emerge postnatally, even when
childhood obesity rates are low.

METHODS
3.1 | The study setting
Mexico provides an ideal setting to evaluate this prediction
because cesarean birth rates are rising (from 24.2% in 1994
to 47.5% in 2011), even among rural farmers (Barber, 2009;
Vogel et al., 2015). The Yucatec Maya in the study commu-
nity are subsistence maize agriculturalists whose economic
structure, demographic characteristics, and subsistence and
household organization have been recorded since 1992 and
described
extensively
elsewhere
(Kramer,
2005,
2009;
Kramer and McMillan, 1998). Although substantial eco-
nomic and technological changes have occurred over the
past 20 years, including the introduction of electricity, run-
ning water, a paved road, motorized vehicles, mechanized
farming and a rudimentary health clinic, young children’s
diet and activity patterns remain relatively unchanged.
The majority of consumed calories come from maize and
garden fruits, vegetables, and beans. Market foods such as
rice and pasta provide occasional dietary supplementation.
Children spend most of their day outside, are given great lati-
tude to independently explore their environment, and are
physically active from a young age. By age three or four,
children run errands, perform simple domestic tasks and take
care of their younger siblings. Although schools have been
built in recent years, few children under the age of five attend
them.
Since 2007, a local health promotor has monitored child
health and growth in a community clinic as part of a govern-
ment poverty-alleviation program. Most young women give
birth in hospital, where the cesarean birthrate is �30% (Veile
and Kramer, 2015). Elective cesarean is not practiced in the
community and cesarean births are viewed by women as an
unfortunate medical necessity (Veile and Kramer, 2015).
Although hospital births are becoming common, some
women prefer to give birth at home assisted by a local mid-
wife. Prolonged and intensive breastfeeding is the norm;
although some mothers practice limited formula feeding, for-
mula augments but never replaces breastmilk (Veile and
Kramer, 2015). Children are generally weaned by two and a
half

age
(median

 child mortality and morbidity are low in the community
(Kramer et al., 2016).
The community is located in a remote tropical setting,
and the environment has many more pathogenic risks com-
pared to most Western settings. For example, children are
frequently exposed to domestic animals and their feces and
to standing water during the rainy season. All households at
minimum have a designated area outside used as a latrine,
though a handful of families have a covered facility with a
septic reservoir excavated into the bedrock. Shallow latrines
can render living areas susceptible to fecal contamination,
especially in the rainy season.
Until a few years ago, pigs freely roamed through the
community. While a nuisance, they disposed of organic
trash. The introduction of plastic and cardboard containers
now poses a challenge to villagers in terms of trash disposal.
Some burn or bury their trash, while others maintain above-
ground trash pits some distance from the house. Birth mode
is not statistically associated with household sanitary condi-
tions (neither for human waste disposal: septic tank versus
latrine, Pearson Chi-Square 50.07, P 5 .800, n 5 108, nor
for trash disposal method: burn versus bury, Pearson Chi-
Square 5 0.64, P 5 .420, n 5 108), and therefore these
household conditions should not confound its effect on child
growth.
3.2 | Data collection
Mothers were recruited during household visits and selected
according to the following criteria: (1) they had children
aged 0–5 in the period between 2007 and 2014 when child
growth measurements were taken, and (2) the birthweight of
their children was known. The final sample consisted of 57
mothers (66% of the 87 married women in Xculoc who were
aged 17–50 as of 2014) and 108 children (with 3756
monthly anthropometric
observations).
The
height
and
weight of the Maya children were collected in the commu-
nity clinic each month by a community-based, physician-
trained health promotor using standard weigh scales and sta-
diometers. All community mothers participated in the pro-
gram with few missed monthly measurements. Children
entered the program at birth and censused out on their fifth
birthday. Maternal height and weight were also collected
annually and maintained in a database by KK.
During reproductive history interviews in 2015, mothers
were asked if their children were born vaginally or by cesar-
ean delivery, and how much their children weighed at birth
(with documentation provided when available). Reported
maternal and child ages were cross-checked with demo-
graphic data and reproductive histories collected at regular
intervals since 1992. Permits for research were secured from
the local government and the health promoter at the commu-
nity clinic. Research protocols were approved by the Com-
mittee for the Protection of Human Subjects at Dartmouth
College, Hanover, New Hampshire, USA, and at the Univer-
sity of Utah, Salt Lake City.
3.3 | Data analysis
Both WHO and Maya population-specific Z-scores were cal-
culated. The justification for using population-specific Z-
scores, and methods used to compute them, are described in
detail in Kramer et al. (2016). Here, we use Maya
population-specific Z-scores for intrapopulation comparisons
and WHO Z-scores for cross-cultural reference purposes
only.
Child underweight, overweight and obesity were calcu-
lated as per the WHO criteria for children (�22, � 2,
and � 3 WHO BMI Z-scores, respectively). Maternal under-
weight, overweight and obesity were calculated as per the
WHO criteria for adults (BMI � 18.5, � 25 and � 30, respec-
tively). Because we had repeated measures on children, they
were classified as “underweight,” “overweight,” or “obese”
at each observation. To calculate a community-wide preva-
lence, children were classified as “underweight,” “over-
weight,” or “obese” only when the respective criteria was
met on >50% of observations.
Population-specific Z-scores were derived from a refer-
ence population of 104 Maya children (aged 0–5) for whom
longitudinal growth data are available. This reference popu-
lation was used to compute Z-scores in another growth
paper, and is used here to maintain consistency (Kramer
et al., 2016). Population-specific Z-scores are defined as
standard deviation (z 5 (x 2 l)/r) of log-normalized, age-
specific (monthly), and gender-specific raw weight or BMI
values [weight (kg)/height (m2)]. Maya population-specific
WAZ and BMIZ were then the outcome variables of a series
of LMM fit by REML (Restricted Maximum Likelihood), a
statistical method of estimating unbiased variance compo-
nents (Corbeil and Shayle 1976).
Models were constructed using SPSS Statistics 22 (IBM
Corp., 2013). We accounted for the nonindependent error
across several factors by treating these models as a nested
repeated-measure LMM. Because some children had the
same mother, child’s ID was nested within mother’s id and
treated as a random effect. The initial models accounted for
the following covariates: maternal age, maternal BMI, child
birthweight, child age, child sex, and enrollment in Oportu-
nidades (now Prospera), a Mexican government poverty-
alleviation program which can influence child growth out-
comes (Fernald et al., 2009). We also tested for significant
two-and three-way interactions between birth mode and
birthweight, birth mode and maternal age, birth mode and
maternal BMI, birth mode and child age. Best-fit models for
each outcome variable (WAZ and BMIZ) were selected by
comparing AIC values when variables were dropped from

VEILE AND KRAMER
 the full model using backward selection. If the change in
AIC between two models differed by � 2, the model with
fewer predictor variables was selected.
3.4 | Sample considerations
Anthropometric data were missing for two mothers. Height
data for one child, and Oportunidades data for three children
were missing. Because the Centers for Disease Control and
WHO do not recommend clinical use of BMI in infants <2
years of age (CDC, 2015), BMI was only computed for the
93 children who were over age two at the time of measure-
ment. One child with a low birthweight (1800 g) was
excluded from the final growth models as a statistical outlier.
When this outlier was retained in the models, the strength of
the interactions between birth mode and birthweight substan-
tially increased; removing the outlier dampened the interac-
tion effect.
Due to the longitudinal nature of the growth data (with
children of different ages phasing in and out of the sample at
different times), measurements did not exist for all children
at all ages. We therefore displayed the data using the mean
of the predicted values derived from the best fit model and
for children who were sampled at a given time [one month
of age and 60 months of age for WAZ (Figure 1), and 24
months of age and 60 months of age for BMIZ (Figure 2)].
We then calculated a 95% confidence interval around the
best-fit models predicted mean values using standard errors
for the predicted mean values. In Figures 1 and 2, children’s
birthweights and maternal BMI were grouped as “high” ver-
sus “low” if their values fell above or below the sample
mean, respectively.

RESULTS
4.1 | Descriptive statistics
Descriptive statistics for the study sample are provided in
Table 1. The child sample was 61% male and 39% female,
and 70% (n 5 105) of children lived in families who were
beneficiaries of Oportunidades. All children in the sample
were born between 2002 and 2015, of which 80% were
hospital-born and 20% born in the community (n 5 108).
Cesarean-born children comprised 20% of the sample
whereas 80% were vaginally born (n 5 108). Among hospital
births, the cesarean rate was 26% (n 5 86). Only seven chil-
dren (6%) were low birthweight (LBW < 2500 g), which is
similar to Mexico’s national LBW rate (Buekens et al.,
2013).
Vaginally born children did not significantly differ from
cesarean-born children in mean birthweight or in maternal
BMI (f 5 0.07, P 5 .79, n 5 108; Table 1). However, vagi-
nally born children had significantly lower WHO Z-scores
than cesarean-born children (f 5 89.17, P 5 <.01, n 5 108
for WAZ, f 5 19.30, P 5 <.01, n 5 108 for HAZ, f 5
111.75, P 5 <.01, n 5 93 for BMIZ, Table 1). Of children

 ages 2–5 (n 5 93), according to the WHO criteria no chil-
dren were obese or underweight and 5 children were over-
weight (5%). Using the WHO criteria for adults, 21% of
their mothers were obese, 55% were overweight, and 24%
were normal weight (n 5 56).
4.2 | Weight-for-age
Cesarean birth was a significant predictor of child WAZ; this
persisted when accounting for a number of confounders and
after including significant interactions. In the best-fit predic-
tion model (Table 2), birthweight, child age, female sex, and
maternal BMI were positively associated with child WAZ,
while maternal age was negatively associated with child
WAZ. The model also accounts for significant interactions
between birth mode and maternal BMI, and between birth
mode and child age (Table 2).
Figure 1 reveals the nature of the interactions. Notably,
children whose mothers had high BMI had greater WAZ-
scores in early infancy than children whose mothers had low
BMI, regardless of their mode of birth. Among children whose
mothers had high BMI, cesarean and vaginally born children
had identical WAZ-scores at one month (WAZ 5 0.38), but
then their WAZ trajectories diverged due to the interaction
effects of birth mode and child age. WAZ increased in
cesarean-born children with age, and decreased in vaginally
born children with age. By 60 months, the cesarean-born chil-
dren had substantially higher WAZ-scores than did the vagi-
nally born children (WAZ 5 0.91 vs. 20.07, respectively).
Among children whose mothers had low BMI, cesarean-
born children had higher WAZ-scores than vaginally born
children at one month (WAZ 5 20.05 vs. 20.26, respec-
tively). Their WAZ trajectories differ across childhood. In
cesarean-born children, the WAZ trajectory remains virtually
unchanged from 1 to 60 months. In contrast, vaginally born
children experienced a linear increase in WAZ-score from 1
to 60 months (at 60 months, WAZ 5 20.05 vs. 20.01,
respectively). By 60 months, their WAZ-scores nearly con-
verge, and do not differ substantially from that of vaginally
born children whose mothers had high BMI.
4.3 | BMI-for-age
In the best-fit model (Table 3), birthweight, female sex,
maternal BMI, and Oportunidades status were positively
associated with child BMIZ. The model also accounts for
significant interactions between birth mode and maternal
BMI, and between birth mode and birthweight. Cesarean
birth predicts high BMIZ, and effect is most pronounced in
children with high birthweights, and whose mothers had a
high BMI.
Cesarean-born children who had high birthweights and
whose mothers had high BMI, had higher BMIZ-scores at 24

DISCUSSION
5.1 | Summary of results
Even in the absence of childhood obesity and several
obesity-related confounders, we find evidence that cesarean
birth is associated with child growth outcomes in the Maya
community (summarized in Table 4). WAZ is high in
cesarean-born children, but in only those whose mothers had
high BMI; differences between cesarean and vaginally born
children born to mothers with high BMI increased with child
age. Among children whose mothers had low BMI, we saw
less pronounced differences in WAZ between cesarean and
vaginally born children. We saw increased BMIZ in
cesarean-born children even when accounting for birthweight
and maternal BMI. The effect of cesarean birth on child
BMIZ was most pronounced in children who had high birth-
weights (and whose mothers had high BMI), and least pro-
nounced in children who had low birthweights (and whose
mothers had low BMI). This pattern was consistent in chil-
dren from 24 to 60 months of age.
In other words, cesarean birth was a predictor of child-
hood WAZ and BMIZ after accounting for maternal effects
and child birthweight and sex. Children who were born by
cesarean to mothers with high BMI had the highest WAZ of
all children by 5 years of age, and the highest BMIZ of all
children at all ages. Our findings are consistent with those of
Bluestein and coworkers (2013). They report that in a cohort
of 10,219 British mother-child pairs, the association between
cesarean birth and childhood obesity was strong only among
children born to overweight and obese mothers. This is sug-
gestive of a cross-culturally robust pattern; however, Maya
women are very short in contrast to British women and are
in the early stages of the nutritional transition. Their dietary
profiles and body composition will therefore differ substan-
tially; indeed different biological mechanisms may underlie
this phenomenon in such distinct populations.

than we expected. It may continue to rise due to very recent

 modernizing influences such as the introduction of television,
western biomedicine, and market foods. Childhood obesity is
currently absent in the study community, although we found
high rates of maternal obesity. We attribute the discrepancies
in maternal and childhood obesity less to differences in diet,
than to their disparate physical activity patterns. Kramer has
observed that women’s energy expenditure has decreased
substantially since the introduction of labor-saving techology
such as mechanized maize processing and water collection
(Kramer and McMillan 1998, 1999, 2006). More recently
additional labor-saving technology such as mechanized farm-
ing and clothes washing machines have been introduced.
In contrast to adult women, young children are physically
active and highly mobile. Children do not begin schooling
until age five or six, and televisions only exist in a few
homes. Preschool aged children spend much of their time
traveling though the community on foot and are frequently
observed engaging in active play, running errands, carrying
their young siblings, or doing domestic chores.
Girls are slightly (but significantly) heavier and have
greater BMI than boys in our models. We offer two tenative
explanations. First, it may reflect the disparate activity pat-
terns that emerge between the sexes from an early age.
Though boys and girls are both free to wander the village,
boys tend to wander more widely and engage more in com-
petitive sports and rough and tumble play. Second, it may be
indicative of shifting parental investment patterns. Through
Oportunidades (Prospera), families receive larger stipends
for female children as an incentive to keep them in school.
The stipends do not differentiate until secondary school

 (starting at �11 years of age), but parents be may faculta-
tively increasing investment even in young female children.
If so, this may be viewed as a behavioral response to novel
socioeconomic conditions, as daughters now potentially
yield a greater economic payoff (at least in the short term).
5.3 | Birth mode, maternal size, and child growth
We find that childhood WAZ and BMIZ increases are pro-
nounced in children who are both cesarean-born and whose
mothers have high BMI. This is consistent with our sugges-
tion that cesarean-linked disruptions in the development of
infant microbiota have an influence on later fat storage pat-
terns. In a number of studies, maternal BMI is also a predic-
tor of offspring obesity (Bammann et al., 2014; Catalano
et al., 2009; Oken, 2009; Poston, 2012). Indeed, levels of
glucose, triglycerides, and fatty acids are high in obese preg-
nant mothers, which contributes to increased fetal adiposity
and can have long-lasting effects on the child’s metabolic
function (Drake and Reynolds, 2010; HAPO 2009).
Previous work among Yucatec Maya (in the urban center
of Merida) reveals similar correlations between maternal and
child body sizes, although they were strongest for linear
growth measures (Azcorra, 2014; Varela-Silva et al., 2009).
The researchers conclude that the biological effects of a poor
diet on growth are transmitted intergenerationally through
matrilineal intrauterine environments, and that poor health
outcomes in Maya children today (obesity and stunting)
reflect a history of deprivation. Compared with the urban
Maya sample, our study community is rural and much less
integrated into Mexico’s market economy, and baseline rates
of obesity and overweight are much lower.
We find that the interaction between cesarean birth and
high maternal BMI (not cesarean birth per se) predicts nota-
bly increased WAZ and BMIZ-scores at most stages of
childhood. This may be due in part to compromised mother-
infant transmission of microbial communities. For example,
overweight Spanish pregnant women exhibit higher concen-
trations of Bacteroides, Clostridium, and Staphylococcus and
their infants have elevated fecal Bacteroides, Clostridium,
and Staphylococcus concentrations and lower Bifidobacte-
rium concentrations during the first six months of life (Col-
lado et al., 2008, 2010). If similar alterations are present in
the gut microbiome of obese Maya women, then our
observed associations between maternal BMI and offspring
BMIZ and WAZ may also be driven in part by mother-to-
infant transmission of gut microbiota.
However, as we have described, in a cesarean birth this
transfer is disrupted. We suspect that this disruption ampliflies
the effects of maternal obesity on child growth, although an
additional (nonmutually exclusive) mechanism has been pro-
posed (Gur et al., 2015). Cesarean birth is considered to be
more stressful than a vaginal birth and is associated with
increased
glucocorticoids
and
catecholamine
hormones
(Loughran et al., 1986; Ryding et al., 1998; Scheinin et al.,
1990). These can negatively impact infant adaptation to extra-
uterine life and compromise longer-term health outcomes
(Hillman et al., 2012). Future research efforts should attempt
to untangle the interactions of maternal condition and birth
mode and their effects on growth, the development of stress
neurobiology, and microbiome assemble in infancy and early
childhood.

CONCLUSION
Cesarean birth rates are rising world wide, and the maternal-
child health costs of unnecessary cesareans are potentially quite
high. The costs have mainly been documented in industrialized
settings; yet it is plausible that they are manifested differently
in poor and rural settings. As we have demonstrated, the poten-
tial interactions and outcomes are complex and require further
examination, especially in communities that are in the early
stages of the nutritional transition. Some of the negative out-
comes associated with unnecessary cesareans may be exacer-
bated; for example, poor women who have had cesareans may
lack the resources to pay for prolonged postnatal hospital care.
Furthermore, they may live in settings with limited sanitary
infrastructure, which increases the risk of postnatal mother-
infant morbidity. Finally, cesarean births are associated immu-
nopathologies and obesity; this may exacerbate chronic disease
epidemics that are underway or burgeoning due to the nutri-
tional transition.
