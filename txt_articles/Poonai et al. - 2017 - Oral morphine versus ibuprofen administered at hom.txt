oderate to severe pain is the most common postopera-
tive pediatric complaint,1 particularly within 24 hours2 
and even after minor surgery.3–7 Inadequate analgesia 
is prevalent after outpatient pediatric surgery3,6–10 and is the most 
common reason for unplanned hospital admissions.11 In chil-
dren, suboptimal analgesia can result in sleep disturbance, 
behavioural changes and vomiting.12 Untreated pain leads to 
slower wound healing,13 needle phobia,14 hyperesthesia15 and 
fear of medical procedures.16
Undertreatment is an important cause of inadequate post-
operative analgesia.17–20 Both ibuprofen21,22 and oral mor-
phine22,23 have shown benefit in children with musculoskeletal 
injuries. Following deaths of children who received codeine 
postoperatively,24,25 the United States Food and Drug Adminis-
tration26 and Health Canada27 issued advisories. Orthopedic 
procedures are associated with the highest incidence of post-
discharge pain.28,29 Although not discipline-specific, more than 
80% of pediatric surgeries are performed on an outpatient 
basis,30 which renders pain management largely the respon-
sibility of caregivers at home. Oral morphine and other opioids 
are being prescribed more often.31–33 However, evidence sup-
porting morphine for at-home postoperative pain management 
in children is lacking.  
Given the lack of consensus standards for analgesia after 
pediatric outpatient surgery, suboptimal provision of analgesia2,9 
and growing fears about opioids, there is an urgent need for evi-
dence to guide outpatient analgesic choices for children at dis-
charge. We sought to evaluate whether oral morphine was 
su 
perior to ibuprofen for relieving children’s pain at home, after 
minor outpatient orthopedic surgery.

ABSTRACT
BACKGROUND: Oral morphine for post-
operative pain after minor pediatric sur-
gery, while increasingly popular, is not 
supported by evidence. We evaluated 
whether oral morphine was superior to 
ibuprofen for at-home management of 
children’s postoperative pain.
METHODS: We conducted a randomized 
superiority trial comparing oral morphine 
(0.5 mg/kg) with ibuprofen (10 mg/kg) in 
children 5 to 17 years of age who had 
undergone minor outpatient orthopedic 
surgery (June 2013 to September 2016). 
Participants took up to 8 doses of the 
intervention drug every 6 hours as 
needed for pain at home. The primary 
outcome was pain, according to the 
Faces Pain Scale – Revised, for the first 
dose. Secondary outcomes included 
additional analgesic requirements, 
adverse effects, unplanned health care 
visits and pain scores for doses 2 to 8.
RESULTS: We analyzed data for 77 partici-
pants in each of the morphine and ibupro-
fen groups. Both interventions decreased 
pain scores with no difference in efficacy. 
The median difference in pain score 
before and after the first dose of medica-
tion was 1 (interquartile range 0–1) for 
both morphine and ibuprofen (p = 0.2). 
For doses 2 to 8, the median differences in 
pain score before and after the dose were 
not significantly different between 
groups. Significantly more participants 
taking morphine reported adverse effects 
(45/65 [69%] v. 26/67 [39%], p < 0.001), 
most commonly drowsiness (31/65 [48%] 
v. 15/67 [22%] in the morphine and ibu-
profen groups, respectively; p = 0.003).
INTERPRETATION: Morphine was not 
superior to ibuprofen, and both drugs 
decreased pain with no apparent differ-
ence in efficacy. Morphine was associ-
ated with significantly more adverse 
effects, which suggests that ibuprofen is 
a better first-line option after minor sur-
gery. Trial registration: ClinicalTrials.

Methods
Design and setting
For this parallel-group, randomized, blinded superiority trial, we 
recruited participants from June 2013 to September 2016 at the 
Children’s Hospital, London Health Sciences Centre, London, 
Ontario, where about 150 pediatric outpatient orthopedic sur-
geries are performed annually. A data and safety monitoring 
board convened at 25%, 50% and 75% recruitment to monitor 
adverse effects.
Participants
We included all children aged 5 to 17 years who presented to the 
pediatric orthopedic clinic and were scheduled for minor 
outpatient surgery. We excluded children with known 
hypersensitivity to ibuprofen or morphine, long-term use of 
nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) or opioids, renal 
insufficiency, bleeding disorder, cognitive impairment, 
obstructive sleep apnea, regional anesthesia or pregnancy.
Patients were screened consecutively for eligibility by a 
research assistant, who obtained informed consent and assent 
from all participants or their legal guardians, and who performed 
all study-related correspondence with participants.
Interventions
The hospital pharmacy performed randomization, using a com-
puter-based random number generator (www.randomization.
com). Eligible participants were randomly assigned in a 1:1 allo-
cation ratio using a block size of 4 or 6 to receive either standard-
release oral morphine (0.5 mg/kg, maximum 20 mg) or oral ibu-
profen (10 mg/kg, maximum 600 mg) every 6 hours as needed for 
pain, for a total of 48 hours after discharge (maximum 8 doses). 
Allocation was concealed through use of sequentially numbered, 
opaque sealed envelopes. Study medications and placebos were 
kept in identical opaque sealed bottles and were dispensed in 
identical white plastic vials. Because of differences in taste and 
consistency, we employed a double-dummy approach34 whereby 
each participant was given 8 prepackaged doses consisting of 
2 vials (morphine and placebo ibuprofen or placebo morphine 
and ibuprofen). The placebos were identical in taste, colour and 
consistency to their active drug counterparts, so that partici-
pants were unaware of which intervention they were receiving. A 
protocol for unmasking was available on an emergency basis. 
Participants were asked to take a second dose if they vomited 
within 30 minutes of the first. For pain persisting longer than 
60 minutes after the intervention, participants were instructed to 
take acetaminophen 15 mg/kg (maximum of 975 mg).
Participants recorded their pain using the Faces Pain Scale – 
Revised35 at discharge and at home (immediately before and 
30 min after each dose). Thirty minutes is the time to a clinically 
significant reduction in pain,23,36 to peak plasma concentration 
for oral morphine37 and to onset of analgesia for ibuprofen.38 
Consistent with the described use of the Faces Pain Scale – 
Revised,39 we instructed all children to circle the face on the hor-
izontal axis that corresponded to their pain level. We asked care-
givers to supervise their children to ensure that only 1 face was 
circled at each time point. Caregivers and participants also 
recorded the number of acetaminophen doses taken for pain 
and any adverse effects that occurred within 96 hours of the first 
dose (selected from a list of known adverse effects). 
Participants returned data collection forms by mail, using a 
stamped, self-addressed envelope, and returned unused medica-
tion to the study coordinator at the follow-up orthopedic clinic 
visit. We corroborated the reported number of doses taken with 
the medication that remained on the follow-up visit. We con-
tacted participants whose forms contained unclear information. 
Discrepancies were resolved by discussion with the caregivers. 
A research assistant entered data from the forms into a study-
specific Excel spreadsheet. Participants received a phone call at 
24, 48, 72 and 96 hours after discharge to inquire about severe 
adverse events and unscheduled visits to a health care provider. 
Participants, caregivers and all members of the research team 
were blinded to the interventions.
Anesthesia and analgesia before discharge were provided as 
per the standard of care at our institution. Intraoperatively, par-
ticipants received a weight-based dose of fentanyl and propofol 
with or without lidocaine for induction and sevoflurane for main-
tenance of anesthesia. At the end of the case, each participant 
received a subcutaneous injection of 2–5 mL of 1% lidocaine 
around the incision site. In the postanesthetic care unit, each 
participant received a weight-based dose of aceta 
minophen or, if 
the patient was in more severe pain, intravenous (IV) morphine.
Outcome measures
The primary outcome was the pre–post difference in self-
reported pain for the first dose, based on the pain scale.35 The 
Faces Pain Scale – Revised has been validated for postoperative 
use40 in children from 4 to 12 years of age39 and is believed to be 
clinically useful for older children.41 Although not validated for 
home use, the scale has been used at home for fracture pain22 
and postoperative pain,2 is preferred by children,40 does not 
require training42 and was easily interpretable across our sam-
ple’s age range.41 The 6-item Faces Pain Scale – Revised is scored 
from 0 (no pain) to 10 (maximum pain), with severity defined as 
none (0 or 2), mild (4), moderate (6) or severe (8 or 10).43 Second-
ary outcomes included the pre–post difference in pain for the 
second to eighth doses (also based on the pain scale), the num-
ber of participants requiring breakthrough acetaminophen for 
pain, unscheduled visits to a health care provider for pain within 
96 hours of the first dose and adverse effects.
Statistical analysis
We analyzed between-group differences in pain scores using an 
intention-to-treat analysis, based on the assumption that for par-
ticipants who received no study intervention, the pre–post differ-
ence in pain scores would be zero. A difference in pain intensity 
of 1 face on the Faces Pain Scale – Revised has been shown to be 
a minimal clinically important difference.43,44 We analyzed the 
between-group differences in pain scores using the Wilcoxon 
2-sample test. We used a mixed linear regression model, with an 
unstructured covariance matrix, to assess between-group differ-
ences in pain scores across all doses over time. We used the

CMAJ  |  OCTOBER 10, 2017  |  VOLUME 189  |  ISSUE 40 
Pearson χ2 test or Student t test to evaluate differences in aceta-
minophen use and adverse effects. The study was powered to 
detect a between-group difference in the primary outcome. 
Assuming a standard deviation of 2 faces,39,41 63 children per 
group were required to detect a between-group difference of 
1 face at the 5%, 2-sided level of significance with 80% power.45 
We used SPSS software, version 23 (IBM). We considered p values 
less than 0.05 to be statistically significant.
Ethics approval
This trial was approved by the Health Sciences Research Ethics 
Board of Western University. 
Results
Participants
We report results of an intention-to-treat analysis of 154 partici-
pants, of whom 71 (46%) were female (Figure 1, Table 1). The 
mean age was 12.4 (standard deviation [SD] 3.5) years. The 
overall mean pain score at discharge was 2.3 (SD 1.3) (Table 1). 
No participants were lost to follow-up. Eight participants with-
drew after randomization because they believed that ibuprofen 
would not adequately manage pain. Thirteen participants did 
not take any study medication, and all of these reported that 
the pain had not been sufficiently severe. All study vials were 
returned, and all opened vials were empty. For all but 1 partici-
pant, the number of used vials corresponded to the information 
on the data collection form. For the 1 exception, the participant 
reported a single pair of pain scores independent of analgesic 
administration. There were no obvious between-group differ-
ences in surgical procedures performed. No participants 
received intra-articular analgesia, regional analgesia, clonidine 
or long-acting analgesics. Three participants (2 in the morphine 
group and 1 in the ibuprofen group) received a single dose of IV 
morphine 0.05 mg/kg in the postanesthetic care unit. The 
demographic characteristics of participants who underwent 
randomization and did not take any study medication are pre-
sented in Table 2.

Primary outcome
The median time to the first dose was 3.3 (interquartile range 
[IQR] 0.5–6) hours for the morphine group and 3.5 (IQR 1–6) for 
the ibuprofen group. There were no significant differences 
between groups in the change in pain scores for the first dose 
(p = 0.2) (Table 3). There were no significant between-group dif-
ferences in pain scores over time (p = 0.4).
Secondary outcomes
Sixty-five (84%) and 67 (87%) of participants took at least 
1 dose of oral morphine or ibuprofen, respectively. There were 
no significant differences in the change in pain scores for doses 
2 to 8. However, both morphine and ibuprofen produced a 
decrease in pain scores with each dose (Table 3). There was no 
significant difference in the number of participants who 
required acetaminophen for breakthrough pain (p = 0.2). 
Among participants who took acetaminophen, there was no 
significant difference in the number of acetaminophen doses 
taken per participant (p = 0.09) (Table 4). Significantly more 
participants in the morphine group than in the ibuprofen group 
experienced adverse effects (45/65 [69%] v. 26/67 [39%], p < 
0.001; Table 4). There were no serious adverse events, deaths, 
unscheduled visits to a health care provider for pain or adverse 
events, or unmasking of the intervention.
Interpretation
In this trial of at-home pain management in children who under-
went minor orthopedic surgery, both oral morphine and ibupro-
fen reduced pain with no apparent difference in analgesic effi-
cacy. Most of the children experienced pain severe enough to 
require analgesia. Oral morphine was associated with signifi-
cantly more adverse effects, which suggests that ibuprofen is a 
safer first-line analgesic.
Among children who have undergone ambulatory surgery, oral 
morphine has not been studied for at-home therapy, nor has it 
been compared with ibuprofen, a frequently used analgesic. Our 
results are consistent with those from a study of children with non-
operative fractures in which oral morphine produced analgesia 
comparable to that with ibuprofen but had significantly more 
adverse effects.22 In children remaining in hospital after surgery, 
several studies have found that parenteral46 and oral morphine47,48 
did not produce better analgesia than active comparators. Our 
findings contribute to this evidence, because we have shown that 
after discharge from ambulatory surgery, oral morphine has no 
analgesic advantage over ibuprofen for first-line treatment of pain.

In contrast to our findings that ibuprofen was associated with 
clinically significant pain reduction,39 a systematic review of 
NSAIDs for children in the postanesthetic care unit suggested 
otherwise.49 Unlike patients receiving care in hospital, our sam-
ple included children who underwent minor surgeries that may 
not have been associated with severe pain43 and who may have 
experienced less distress in their home environment. Among 
pediatric inpatients, anxiety has been found to be highly cor-
related with postoperative pain.50
In our study, pre-intervention pain scores for the first 6 doses 
correlated with mild to moderate pain,43 but were associated 
with a perceived need for analgesia.41,51 For the first 6 doses, both 
agents produced a modest but clinically important reduction in 
pain.39 However, most post-intervention pain scores remained 
above the analgesic threshold recommended by the World 
Health Organization.51 Consistent with our work, neither ibupro-
fen nor oral morphine (nor a combination) has shown complete 
efficacy in children with musculoskeletal injury.52 We also found 
that more than 80% of children required analgesia in the first 
24 hours. This result suggests that adequate pain management 
should be an important goal of care, even after minor outpatient 
surgery, and that more effective pharmacologic and nonpharma-
cologic strategies should be explored.
The most common adverse effects associated with morphine 
were drowsiness (48%) and nausea (46%), in keeping with previ-
ous studies.22,33,46 Among pediatric patients with obstructive 
sleep apnea who underwent tonsillectomy, Kelly and col-
leagues48 described a significantly higher frequency of oxygen 
desaturation with oral morphine. We chose not to measure this 
outcome because our sample included children with orthopedic 
pathology and excluded patients with obstructive sleep apnea. 
Concerns about adverse effects are prevalent (73%) among care-
givers of children who undergo outpatient surgery,3 as are con-
cerns regarding the addictive potential of opioids.3,33 These con-
cerns may be fueled by recent pediatric evidence of long-term 
risks53 and increased hospital admissions related to opioids.54 
These reports, together with our findings, suggest that ibuprofen

may be more acceptable to caregivers who are managing chil-
dren’s pain at home.
Finally, access to analgesia is a barrier to effective postopera-
tive pain management.20 Opioids, including morphine, typically 
require a prescription and a dispensing source. In contrast, ibu-
profen is available without a prescription and is relatively inex-
pensive; furthermore, accidental ingestion and intentional over-
dose have less severe clinical consequences.
Limitations
The primary limitation of our study was the requirement for a 
fixed dosing interval (6 h) to preserve blinding. Differences in the 
duration of action between morphine (2–4 h)37 and ibuprofen 
(4–8 h)55 could have led to greater analgesic requirements in the 
morphine group. We found the opposite, however, in that more 
participants in the ibuprofen group reported using acetamino-
phen for breakthrough pain. More importantly, median pre-
intervention pain scores were virtually identical in the 2 groups. 
Second, we included participants who underwent a variety of sur-
gical procedures, which may have contributed to baseline hetero-
geneity. Our study was not powered for secondary outcomes, but 
we do not believe this imparted any substantial bias, because 
there were no large differences in discharge or pre-
intervention pain scores or in the number of medication doses. 
Third, the Faces Pain Scale – Revised is a self-reporting tool not 
validated for home use. However, we believed it to be the single 
best approach to determining pain levels at home, and it is cur-
rently the recommended instrument for the age range of patients 
included in this study.56–59 In contrast to self-reported measures, 
observational assessments by health care providers, though argu-
ably more objective, have been found to underestimate children’s 
postoperative pain.40 Finally, our results may not be applicable to 
children who have undergone surgical procedures associated 
with greater than moderate levels of pain.
Conclusion
Both oral morphine and ibuprofen were associated with clinically 
significant pain reduction in children who underwent minor 
outpatient orthopedic surgery. Morphine did not provide 
superior analgesia, but was associated with significantly more 
adverse effects, making ibuprofen a better analgesic option. 
Importantly, pain was not completely managed by either 
intervention. Future work should explore whether combinations 
of non-opioid analgesics, more potent opioids with fewer 
adverse effects or nonpharmacologic therapies offer greater 
benefit, particularly for more severe pain.
