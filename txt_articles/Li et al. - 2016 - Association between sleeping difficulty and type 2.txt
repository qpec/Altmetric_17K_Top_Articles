Abstract
Aims/hypothesis Sleeping difficulty has been associated with
type 2 diabetes in some prior studies. Whether the observed
associations are independent of health behaviours, other
cardiovascular risk factors or other sleep disorders is unclear.
Methods We analysed data from 133,353 women without
diabetes, cardiovascular disease and cancer at baseline in the
Nurses’ Health Study (NHS, 2000–2010) and the NHSII
(2001–2011). Sleeping difficulty was assessed as having
difficulty falling or staying asleep ‘all of the time’ or ‘most
of the time’ at baseline (2000 in NHS and 2001 in NHSII).
Results We documented 6,407 incident cases of type 2
diabetes during up to 10 years of follow-up. After adjustment
for lifestyle factors at baseline, comparing women with and
without sleeping difficulty, the multivariate-adjusted HR
(95% CI) for type 2 diabetes was 1.45 (95% CI 1.33, 1.58),
which changed to 1.22 (95% CI 1.12, 1.34) after further
adjustment for hypertension, depression and BMI based on
the updated repeated measurements. Women who reported
all four sleep conditions (sleeping difficulty, frequent snoring,
sleep duration ≤6 h and sleep apnoea in NHS or rotating shift
work in NHSII) had more than a fourfold increased likelihood
of type 2 diabetes (HR 4.17, 95% CI 2.93, 5.91).
Conclusions/interpretation Sleeping difficulty was signifi-
cantly associated with type 2 diabetes. This association was
partially explained by associations with hypertension, BMI
and depression symptoms, and was particularly strong when
combined with other sleep disorders. Our findings highlight
the importance of sleep disturbance in the development and
prevention of type 2 diabetes.

 Introduction
Sleeping difficulty is a common disorder characterised by
difficulty initiating or maintaining sleep [1, 2], affecting
approximately 10% to 20% of the general population in the
USA [1]. In a study of US adults, the number of outpatient
visits identified to be due to sleeping difficulty increased from
4.9 million in 1999 to 5.5 million in 2010 [3].
Experimental studies indicate that inadequate or
fragmented sleep is associated with impaired glucose regula-
tion in healthy young adults [4, 5]. Sleep disturbance has been
shown to adversely influence metabolism and has been in-
creasingly linked to a wide range of adverse health outcomes,
including obesity [6], hypertension [7] and depression [8],
which are all risk factors for type 2 diabetes. A number of
epidemiological studies have identified that difficulty initiat-
ing or maintaining sleep is associated with a significantly in-
creased risk of type 2 diabetes [9–12]. However, it is not clear
whether these associations are explained by the chronic con-
ditions of obesity, hypertension or depression. Short sleep
duration, snoring, sleep apnoea and shift work may co-occur
with sleeping difficulty and associate with diabetes [13–18].
The extent to which prior associations between sleeping
difficulty and diabetes reflects confounding with these other
sleep conditions is unclear.
The high prevalence of both sleeping difficulty and type 2
diabetes points to a need to further understand the link be-
tween the two conditions [1, 19]. In this study, we examined
the association between sleeping difficulty, defined as having
difficulty initiating or maintaining sleep most of the time or all
the time [1, 2], and the risk of developing type 2 diabetes
based on the extracted data from two independent, well-
established cohorts of US women: the Nurses’ Health Study
(NHS) [17] and NHSII [17, 18]. We also examined the joint
effect between sleeping difficulty and short sleep duration,
frequent snoring, sleep apnoea and rotating shift work.
Additionally, we quantified the extent to which the effects of
sleeping difficulty on type 2 diabetes are mediated through
BMI, hypertension and depression.
Methods
Study population The NHS [17] was initiated in 1976 when
121,700 female registered nurses aged 30–55 years completed
a mailed questionnaire. The NHSII cohort [18], established in
1989, comprises 116,671 younger female registered nurses
aged 25 to 42 years. The cohorts have been followed by means
of biennial mailed questionnaires, which inquired about
lifestyle practices and other exposures of interest, as well as
the incidence of disease [17, 18].
The information about sleeping difficulty was derived from
answers by participants who were actively participating in the
NHS surveys in the year 2000 (n = 82,468) or the NHSII
surveys in the year 2001 (n=86,006), which was the baseline
of the proposed study. For the current analysis, we excluded
participants who had ever been diagnosed with cancer
(n= 20,283), cardiovascular disease (n =4,876) or diabetes
(n=7,868) at baseline, or did not respond to the questions
on sleeping difficulty (n=1,021) at baseline or were lost to
follow-up after baseline (n=1,073), leaving 133,353 women
in our primary analysis.
The Institutional Review Boards at the Harvard School of
Public Health and Brigham and Women’s Hospital approved
the study protocol. The completion of the self-administered
questionnaire was considered to imply informed consent.
Ascertainment of sleeping difficulty and other sleep-
related factors The nurses recorded ‘how much of the time
during the past 4 weeks have you had difficulty falling asleep
or staying asleep?’ in 2000 in NHS and 2001 in NHSII. The
possible responses were as follows: ‘all of the time’, ‘most of
the time’, ‘a good bit of the time’, ‘some of the time’, ‘a little
of the time’ and ‘none of the time’. In the current study, we
classified the participants who reported difficulty falling
asleep or staying asleep ‘all of the time’ or ‘most of the time’
as having sleeping difficulty whereas the others (‘a good bit of
the time’, ‘some of the time’, ‘a little of the time’ and ‘none of
the time’) were classified as not having sleeping difficulty.
Information on sleep duration and snoring frequency was
collected in both NHS (2000) and NHSII (2001). Short sleep
duration was classified as sleeping ≤6 h/day. Shift work, only
recorded in NHSII at baseline, was assessed as whether the
participant ‘worked permanent night shifts for 6 or more
months during 1995–2001’. Information about sleep apnoea
was only recorded in 2008 in NHS. Physician diagnosis of
sleep apnoea and year of the first diagnosis (1997 or before,
1998–2001, 2002–2005, 2006–2007 or 2008+) were only
recorded in 2008 in NHS.
Ascertainment of type 2 diabetes Type 2 diabetes cases were
defined as self-reported diabetes confirmed by a validated
supplementary questionnaire [17, 18]. For cases before
1998, we used the National Diabetes Data Group criteria to
define type 2 diabetes. We used the American Diabetes Asso-
ciation diagnostic criteria for type 2 diabetes diagnosis from
1998 onwards. The validity of self-reported type 2 diabetes
diagnosis in our cohorts has been previously documented in
detail [20, 21]. Briefly, 97–98% cases were reconfirmed
against blinded physician medical record review [20, 21].
Assessment of other covariates Information on potential
confounders, such as age, ethnicity, smoking status, weight,
height, physical activity, menopausal status and postmeno-
pausal hormone therapy, multiple vitamin use, regular use of
medications (e.g., aspirin, antidepressants, minor tranquilisers
720
Diabetologia (2016) 59:719–727
 and antihypertensive drugs), and physician diagnosis of hy-
pertension and depression was collected via biennial question-
naires. Information on food and alcohol consumption was
collected every 4 years via a validated semi-quantitative food
frequency questionnaire. BMI was calculated as weight (kg)/
height2 (m). Hypertension was considered as either profes-
sionally diagnosed hypertension or use of antihypertensive
medications. A participant was considered as having depres-
sion if she reported physician-diagnosed depression or use of
antidepressant medications. Dietary quality was assessed by
the alternate healthy eating index (AHEI), based on a high
consumption of vegetables, fruit, nuts and legumes, whole
grains, long-chain fats, polyunsaturated fatty acids, and a
low level of sugar-sweetened beverages and fruit juice, red/
processed meat, trans fats and sodium. At baseline, the nurses
ranked their feeling about their standing in US society in 10
levels; those at the top are the people who are the best off—
those who have the most money, the most education, and the
most respectable jobs, while at the bottom are the people who
are the worst off—those who have the least money, the least
education, and the least respectable jobs or no job, which was
used as a surrogate indicator of socioeconomic status (SES).
Statistical analysis Individuals contributed person-time from
the return of the baseline questionnaire (NHS, 2000; NHSII,
2001) until the date of diagnosis of type 2 diabetes, death, loss
to follow-up, or the end of the follow-up period (30 June 2010
for NHS and 30 June 2011 for NHSII), whichever came first.
Multivariable Cox proportional hazards models were used
to estimate HR and 95% CIs of type 2 diabetes according to
the ‘frequency of having difficulty falling asleep or staying
asleep’. A linear trend across the categories was quantified
with a Wald test. We also presented the risk of type 2 diabetes
comparing women with and without sleeping difficulty
(dichotomy). Multivariable models were adjusted for the
baseline levels of menopausal status and postmenopausal
hormone therapy use, smoking status, alcohol consumption,
physical activity, AHEI, ethnicity, family history of diabetes
and self-reported SES status.
To examine the extent to which chronic conditions
explained the association between sleeping difficulty and
risk of type 2 diabetes, we estimated the magnitude of
change in the regression coefficient for sleeping difficulty
with and without adjustment for each individual and mul-
tiple chronic condition, including BMI, hypertension and
depression history, which were updated every other year.
The per cent of excessive risk explained by the chronic
conditions was computed as follows: (1–[βchronic condition-
adjusted multivariable model/βmultivariable model]) × 100% [22];
where βmultivariable model referred to the basic multivariable
beta-coefficient and βchronic condition-adjusted multivariable model
referred to the beta-coefficient from the basic multivari-
able plus chronic conditions. A positive change in the
regression coefficient indicates a change in the rate ratio
towards the null. SAS macro %MEDIATE was applied
(publicly available at www.hsph.harvard.edu/faculty/
spiegelman/mediate.html).
Participants were also classified according to the joint
categories of sleeping difficulty and other sleep-related
conditions, including sleep duration, frequent snoring (every
night or most nights), rotating shift work (worked permanent
night shifts for 6 or more months in last 6 years), and sleep
apnoea (physician diagnosed vs not). We tested the interaction
using multiplicative and additive interaction analyses [23].
The multiplicative interaction was carried out by comparing
the −2 log likelihood of the models with and without interac-
tion term; while the additive interaction was testing by esti-
mation of Relative Excess Risk due to Interaction [23].
In considering the effect of potential reverse causality
between sleeping difficulty and chronic conditions, we did a
sensitivity analysis among a relative healthy population who
had a BMI less than 30 kg/m2 without physician diagnosis of
either hypertension or depression, and with neither antihyper-
tensive nor antidepressant medications at baseline.
The main analysis was based on the pooled data from the
two cohorts (NHS and NHSII) after further adjusting for the
data sources (cohorts). The joint effect between sleeping
difficulty and shift work was only based on the data from
NHSII, while the joint effect between sleeping difficulty and
sleep apnoea was only based on data from NHS.
We also dichotomised each sleep-related exposure, and
then summed these to calculate the number of sleep-related
conditions (0 to 4). In NHS, the individual sleep conditions
included sleeping difficulty, frequent snoring, sleep duration
≤6 h and sleep apnoea; in NHSII, the individual sleep expo-
sures included in the calculation of total number of sleep
conditions included sleeping difficulty, frequent snoring, sleep
duration ≤6 h and shift work.
Data were analysed using a commercially available
software program (SAS, version 9.3; SAS Institute, Cary,
NC, USA), and statistical significance was set at a two-tailed
p<0.05.
Results
At baseline, the percentage of women who reported sleeping
difficulty (having difficulty falling or staying asleep all or
most of the time) was 5.9% in NHS and 4.8% in NHSII.
Sleeping difficulty was associated with a higher BMI, less
physical activity, lower dietary quality score, shorter sleep
duration, more frequent snoring, more common use of minor
tranquillisers, more frequent excessive daytime sleepiness,
higher likelihood of shift work, and higher prevalence of
hypertension and depression symptoms, as shown in Table 1.

 We documented 6,407 cases of type 2 diabetes over a
period of up to 10 years of follow-up. Women with sleeping
difficulty had an increased risk of type 2 diabetes compared
with women without sleeping difficulty (Table 2), which was
independent of a variety of risk factors, including menopausal
status and hormone use, use of multiple vitamins and aspirin,
family history of diabetes, physical activity, dietary quality,
alcohol consumption, SES and smoking. In the multivariate-
adjusted model, comparing women with and without sleeping
difficulty, the multivariate-adjusted HRs (95% CIs) of type 2
diabetes were 1.39 (95% CI 1.22, 1.59) in NHS, 1.46 (95% CI
1.30, 1.64) in NHSII and 1.45 (95% CI 1.33, 1.58) in the
pooled analysis (Table 2).
After further adjustment for status of hypertension, depres-
sion and BMI individually, the HR between sleeping difficulty
and type 2 diabetes fell to 1.34 (95% CI 1.33, 1.58), 1.34
(95% CI 1.22, 1.46) and 1.34 (95% CI 1.22, 1.47), respective-
ly. Adjustment for any combination of two or three pre-
specified metabolic risk factors (obesity, hypertension, depres-
sion) further reduced the HR of sleeping difficulty and diabe-
tes compared with adjustment for one factor. When we adjust-
ed for all three factors, the HRs decreased to a value of 1.22
(95% CI 1.12, 1.34; Fig. 1). The percentage of excessive risk
mediated by these three factors together was 46% (95% CI
33%, 59%).
A significant interaction was observed between sleeping
difficulty and shift work on risk of type 2 diabetes (p for
multiplicative interaction = 0.08 and p for additive interac-
tion=0.04). The multivariate-adjusted HRs of shift work only,
sleeping difficulty only and with both conditions were 1.27
(95% CI 1.14, 1.42), 1.40 (95% CI 1.23, 1.59) and 2.30 (95%
CI 1.78, 2.96), respectively, as compared with women without
sleeping difficulty and never shift work in NHSII (Fig. 2a).
The interactions between sleeping difficulty and any other
sleep conditions, including frequent snoring, sleep apnoea
and short sleep duration were not significant (all p values for
interaction >0.1; Fig. 2b–d). The multivariate-adjusted HRs of
sleep duration ≤6 h only, sleeping difficulty only and with
both conditions were 1.13 (95% CI 1.07, 1.19), 1.32 (95%
CI 1.19, 1.55) and 1.59 (95% CI 1.43, 1.76), respectively, as
compared with women without sleeping difficulty and sleep
duration >6 h in the pooled analysis (Fig. 2d).
To further explore whether the effect of sleeping difficulty
was independent of other sleep conditions, we simultaneously
included all sleep-related factors in the multivariate-adjusted
analysis. The multivariate-adjusted HRs between sleeping
difficulty and type 2 diabetes were 1.26 (95% CI 1.10, 1.46)
in NHS and 1.28 (95% CI 1.13, 1.44) in NHS II after simul-
taneous adjustment for all other sleep-related factors. As com-
pared with women without any of these sleep conditions,
women who reported having one (HR: 1.47, 95% CI 1.39,
1.56), two (HR 2.14, 95% CI 1.99, 2.31), three (HR 2.84,
95% CI 2.48, 3.26) and all four (HR 4.17, 95% CI 2.93,
5.91) sleep conditions had gradually increasing HRs of type
2 diabetes (p trend <0.0001). In a sensitivity analysis, we also
included all potential mediators, confounding factors and
sleep conditions in a single model; the simultaneously
multivariate-adjusted HR between sleeping difficulty and type
2 diabetes was 1.18 (95% CI 1.08, 1.29).
Among the relatively healthy population without obesity,
hypertension or depression at baseline (n=82,903, 62% of the
sample), the multivariate-adjusted HRs of type 2 diabetes dur-
ing up to 10 years of follow-up were 1.44 (95% CI 1.23, 1.74),
comparing women with and without sleeping difficulty after
adjusting for lifestyle factors, SES and baseline BMI, which
decreased to 1.33 (95% CI 1.11, 1.59) after further adjusting
for incident hypertension, incident depression and updated
BMI. The percentage of excessive risk mediated by these
three factors together was 21% (95% CI 9%, 41%) among this
relatively healthy population.
Discussion
In two large prospective cohorts of US women with up to
10 years of follow-up, sleeping difficulty was significantly
associated with type 2 diabetes, independent of lifestyle and
other sleep-related factors. Our mediation analysis suggested
that this positive association was only partially explained by
hypertension, BMI and depression. The combination of
sleeping difficulty and other sleep conditions including
frequent snoring, sleep duration ≤6 h, sleep apnoea and shift
work was associated with a particularly high risk of diabetes.
This paper extends the findings of previous studies in two
important ways. First, it is the first study to examine and
quantify the mediation effects of chronic conditions on the
association between sleeping difficulty and type 2 diabetes.
Second, it is the first one to examine the joint effects and test
the interactions between sleeping difficulty and other sleep-
related conditions on the risk of type 2 diabetes. The findings
provide evidence to clinical physicians and public health
researchers for future diabetes prevention among a high risk
population with multiple sleep disorders.
Our finding that sleeping difficulty is associated with a
higher risk of type 2 diabetes is consistent with previous stud-
ies. So far, six studies have addressed the impact of self-
reported difficulty falling or staying asleep and the risk of type
2 diabetes [9–12, 24–26]. Half of these studies found a signif-
icant positive association between difficulty initiating sleep or
maintaining asleep and the risk of type 2 diabetes [10–12, 24,
25], with significant pooled results: 1.57 (95% CI 1.25, 1.97)
for difficulty initiating sleep and 1.84 (95% CI 1.39, 2.43) for
difficulty in maintaining sleep [9]. Our estimation of 1.45
(95% CI 1.33, 1.58) for sleeping difficulty is quite close to
the estimation in the above meta-analysis. Our study is, so far,
the largest study of sleeping difficulty and type 2 diabetes.

 Besides the main effects of sleeping difficulty, we also
modelled separately with and without different chronic and
sleep conditions to explore potential mechanisms.
Several potential mediating pathways were analysed in this
study, specifically obesity, hypertension and depression.
Sleeping difficulty may influence metabolism and produce
obesity by disturbing circadian rhythms and other physiolog-
ical function [27–29]. Sleep restriction has been shown to be
obesogenic, perhaps by altering appetite-regulating hormones
[30], which could induce unwanted weight gain [6] and even-
tually increase the risk of diabetes. Sleep disturbance is also
associated with hypertension [7] by increasing blood pressure
and sympathetic nervous system activity [31], which may in-
fluence insulin sensitivity. As both obesity and hypertension
are associated with sleeping difficulty and are risk factors for
type 2 diabetes, exploring the potential mediation effect of
obesity and hypertension may be helpful for understanding
the pathway from sleeping difficulty to type 2 diabetes. An-
other important factor is depression. Sleep complaints are
common in depression [8], and are included in the definition
of depression in some cohort studies examining the associa-
tion of depression and diabetes. Previous studies have shown
that depression increases the risk of type 2 diabetes [32]. Our
mediation analysis indicated that the sleeping difficulty to
diabetes association we identified did not depend exclusively
on any specific individual factor or combination of hyperten-
sion, BMI or depression; together they explain half of the
effect of sleeping difficulty on the risk of type 2 diabetes.
The unexplained risk might be caused by other pathways,
which warrant future studies.
Other potential pathways that were analysed in the current
study were sleep conditions accompanied with sleeping
difficulty, specifically short sleep duration, frequent snoring,
sleep apnoea and shift work. Sleep continuity is considered to
be important for normal metabolic function by modulating or
controlling daily patterns in human physiology [27–29]. One
of the most common complications of difficulty falling or

 staying asleep is a reduction in night-time sleep [13, 14]. In
our cohorts, more than 60% of women with sleeping difficulty
(defined as all of the time or most of the time) slept less than
7 h per day, which occurred in only 15–24% of women with-
out difficulty falling or staying asleep. Experimental sleep
restriction reduces glucose tolerance compared with a fully
rested condition [4]. A recent meta-analysis of ten prospective
studies reported an association between short sleep and inci-
dent diabetes of 1.33 (95% CI 1.20, 1.48) [9]. In our analysis,
sleeping difficulty and short sleep duration were independent-
ly but also jointly associated with a higher risk of type 2
diabetes. Our previous analysis found a significant positive
association between short sleep duration, regular snoring,
and rotating shift work and the risk of diabetes [17, 18]. When
we added all of the sleep conditions into the model together,
the association between sleeping difficulty and risk of type 2
diabetes was attenuated but remained significant, which im-
plied that the pathway between sleeping difficulty and diabe-
tes overlapped partially (but not fully) with other sleep
conditions. The present study indicates a particularly high risk
of diabetes when sleeping difficulty is combined with other
sleep conditions such as short sleep duration, snoring, sleep
apnoea and shift work, indicating that these conditions may
exacerbate the adverse effects of each other.
Experimental studies have indicated that not only the quan-
tity and quality of sleep, but also the timing of sleep has an
effect on glucose regulation [33]. The relative decrease in
insulin sensitivity following circadian misalignment and sleep
loss was nearly twice as large (−58%) as that following the
aligned condition (without circadian misalignment) with the
same degree of sleep loss only (−32%, p=0.01) [34]. Epide-
miological studies have also consistently observed significant
associations between shift work and the risk of type 2 diabe-
tes. A recent meta-analysis of twelve studies reported a pooled
odds ratio of 1.09 (95% CI 1.05, 1.12) between ever exposure
to shift work and the risk of diabetes. In our study, shift work
and sleeping difficulty jointly associated with the risk of type
2 diabetes in a manner that was more than additive, which
implied that more diabetes cases would occur in women with
sleeping difficulty who worked in a shift schedule than in
women with only one or the other of these two risk factors.
This result is consistent with a recent finding in the NHSII
cohort that chronotype (preferred sleep timing) is associated
with type 2 diabetes risk, and rotating night shift work signif-
icantly modified this effect, with the lowest risks for early
chronotype individuals working daytime schedules and late-
type chronotype individuals working schedules including
night shifts [35].
Strengths of the present study include the large number of
incident type 2 diabetes cases, long-term follow-up, consistent
findings across two separate cohorts and updated comprehen-
sive information on potential confounders and mediators.
Several limitations also warrant consideration. First,
assessment of sleeping difficulty was based on self-report,
and we did not assess sleep difficulty-related daytime impair-
ment. Objective measurements of sleep onset, maintenance,
sleep duration and sleep quality were not available. Sleeping
difficulty may occur secondary to obesity [13] or be associat-
ed with use of antihypertensive or antidepressant medications.
Similarly, it is possible that individuals had sleeping difficulty
as a result of undiagnosed depression and that the depression
was a residual confounder. We adjusted for these factors, al-
though we cannot totally exclude the potential for residual
confounding. A sensitivity analysis among a healthy popula-
tion without these factors, however, provided a similar esti-
mation of the magnitude of the sleeping difficulty and diabetes
association. In addition, our cohorts included mostly white
women, potentially limiting the generalisability of the find-
ings. However, the relative homogeneity of the study popula-
tions in educational attainment and SES enhances the internal
validity.
In conclusion, this study shows that sleeping difficulty is
associated with type 2 diabetes, which is partially explained
by associations with hypertension, BMI and depression symp-
toms; the association is particularly strong when combined
with other sleep disorders. Our findings highlight the impor-
tance of sleep disturbance in the development and prevention
of type 2 diabetes.
