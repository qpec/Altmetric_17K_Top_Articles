 Importance—Although cardiorespiratory fitness (CRF) is prognostic in older adults, the effect of 
CRF during early adulthood on long-term cardiovascular structure, function, and prognosis is less 
clear.
Objective—To examine whether CRF in young adults is associated with long-term clinical 
outcome and subclinical cardiovascular disease (CVD).
Design, Setting, and Participants—Prospective study of 4872 US adults aged 18 to 30 years 
who underwent treadmill exercise testing at a baseline study visit from March 25, 1985, to June 7, 
1986, and 2472 individuals who underwent a second treadmill test 7 years later. Median follow-up 
was 26.9 years, with assessment of obesity, left ventricular mass and strain, coronary artery 
calcification (CAC), and vital status and incident CVD. Follow-up was complete on August 31, 
2011, and data were analyzed from recruitment through the end of follow-up.
Main Outcomes and Measures—The presence of CAC was assessed by computed 
tomography at years 15 (2000-2001), 20 (2005-2006), and 25 (2010-2011), and left ventricular 
mass was assessed at years 5 (1990-1991) and 25 (with global longitudinal strain). Incident CVD 
and all-cause mortality were adjudicated.
Results—Of the 4872 individuals, 273 (5.6%) died and 193 (4.0%) experienced CVD events 
during follow-up. After comprehensive adjustment, each additional minute of baseline exercise 
test duration was associated with a 15% lower hazard of death (hazard ratio [HR], 0.85; 95% CI, 
0.80-0.91; P < .001) and a 12% lower hazard of CVD (HR, 0.88; 95% CI, 0.81-0.96; P = .002). 
Higher levels of baseline CRF were associated with significantly lower left ventricular mass index 
(β = −0.24; 95% CI, −0.45 to −0.03; P = .02) and significantly better lobal longitudinal strain (β = 
−0.09; 95% CI, −0.14 to −0.05; P < .001) at year 25. Fitness was not associated with CAC. A 1-
minute reduction in fitness by year 7 was associated with 21% and 20% increased hazards of death 
(HR, 1.21; 95% CI, 1.07-1.37; P = .002) and CVD (HR, 1.20; 95% CI, 1.06-1.37; P = .006), 
respectively, along with a more impaired strain (β = 0.15; 95% CI, 0.08-0.23; P < .001). No 
association between change in fitness and CAC was found.
Conclusions and Relevance—Higher levels of fitness at baseline and improvement in fitness 
early in adulthood are favorably associated with lower risks for CVD and mortality. Fitness and 
changes in fitness are associated with myocardial hypertrophy and dysfunction but not CAC. 
Regular efforts to ascertain and improve CRF in young adulthood may play a critical role in 
promoting cardiovascular health and interrupting early CVD pathogenesis.
Cardiorespiratory fitness (CRF) is associated with clinical outcome, with greater levels of 
fitness associated with a decreased risk for cardiovascular disease (CVD).1-4 Despite a shift 
in the locus of CVD prevention to youth,5,6 little evidence currently exists on the role of 
CRF and its changes in young adulthood on long-term clinical cardiovascular outcomes and 
structure. Most large studies of CRF focus on middle-aged and older adults, demonstrating 
that fitness at a single point in time is associated with risk.1-4 Furthermore, understanding 
the implications of fitness early in life—before prevalent CVD or its risk factors—would 
provide important evidence about the mechanisms of the benefit of fitness for general health 
and the development of changes in the cardiovascular system linked to adverse long-term 
prognosis and use of health care resources (eg, heart failure or myocardial infarction).

 cardiac structure, and cardiovascular events in a population of young adults at low clinical 
risk will be critical to shaping risk assessment, care delivery, and policy recommendations 
for fitness and exercise.
We sought to determine the importance of CRF and changes in CRF in young adults in 
relation to future CVD to reinforce a central hypothesis that fitness is a modifiable risk 
factor in young adulthood that reflects long-term CVD progression and prognosis. To this 
end, we examined the association of CRF in young adulthood with clinical and subclinical 
CVD during more than 25 years in the Coronary Artery Risk Development in Young Adults 
(CARDIA) study. We hypothesized that measures of CRF early in adulthood would be 
associated with long-term risks for mortality, CVD, and subclinical CVD independent of 
CVD risk factors, including obesity. In addition, we hypothesized that reductions in CRF 
during a period of 7 years in early adulthood would be associated with long-term clinical 
risk and markers of CVD progression.
Methods
Study Population
The CARDIA study is a longitudinal cohort designed to study determinants of CVD among 
5115 young adults (aged 18-30 years) initially recruited from March 25, 1985, to June 7, 
1986. Participants were recruited from 4 US sites (Birmingham, Alabama; Chicago, Illinois; 
Minneapolis, Minnesota; and Oakland, California). Recruitment balanced enrollment at each 
site by sex, age (18-24 vs 25-30 years), race, and education. Serial follow-up of participants 
at 2 (March 25, 1987, to July 13, 1988), 5 (May 18, 1990, to July 30, 1991), 7 (May 25, 
1992, to June 30, 1993), 10 (May 18, 1995, to June 29, 1996), 15 (May 30, 2000, to June 30, 
2001), 20 (June 1, 2005, to August 31, 2006), and 25 (June 1, 2010, to August 31, 2011) 
years after enrollment has been performed, with retention of 3547 and 3499 surviving 
participants of 4933 and 4849 participants (71.9% and 72.2%) at years 20 and 25, 
respectively. All participants provided written informed consent, with institutional review 
board approval at each field center (University of Alabama at Birmingham, Northwestern 
University, University of Minnesota, and Kaiser Permanente).
We excluded participants who did not start the treadmill test or who were missing maximal 
exercise duration at baseline (n = 154), who were missing baseline covariates used for 
adjustment in statistical analysis (n = 88), or who withdrew study consent (n = 1), leaving 
4872 CARDIA participants for analysis of baseline fitness and long-term risk. Exclusion 
criteria for treadmill testing included resting hypertension (systolic blood pressure ≥160 mm 
Hg; diastolic blood pressure ≥100 mm Hg); prior myocardial infarction, angina, or valvular 
heart disease; current use of cardiovascular medications (excluding antihypertensives and 
thiazide diuretics); and clinical heart failure. In secondary analyses examining the 7-year 
change in CRF, additional exclusions consisted of not attending the year 7 examination (n = 
963), violation of the treadmill protocol (n = 1071, owing to participants holding the 
treadmill apparatus at 1 site), and missing the year 7 treadmill duration or not starting the 
test (n = 366). Thus, 2472 participants underwent analysis for the 7-year change in CRF.

 Clinical Assessments
All clinical assessments were performed at the baseline CARDIA visit (for analyses with 
baseline CRF) and the year 7 visit (for longitudinal changes in CRF).7 Clinical and 
demographic features and physical activity were assessed by questionnaire.8-11 Body mass 
index (BMI; calculated as weight in kilograms divided by height in meters squared) was 
defined as normal (18.5-24.9), overweight (25.0-29.9), or obese (≥30.0) using standard 
conventions. Diabetes mellitus was defined as a fasting blood glucose level of at least 126 
mg/dL (to convert to millimoles per liter, multiply by 0.0555) or receiving medication for 
diabetes mellitus.
Exercise Treadmill Testing
The graded, symptom-limited maximal exercise test followed a modified Balke treadmill 
protocol, which consisted of as many as nine 2-minute stages of gradually increasing 
difficulty.12 We considered maximal exercise duration (in minutes) as our primary measure 
of CRF. Participants underwent a second assessment at 7 years with treadmill exercise 
testing to determine the association of changes in CRF over time with prognosis.
Cardiovascular Imaging
We examined the coronary artery calcification (CAC) score (range, 0-5949.9, with greater 
scores indicating greater burden of atherosclerosis) at the most contemporary CARDIA 
examination (year 25) using multiple-detector computed tomography.13 CAC, also measured 
at years 15 and 20, was handled as nonzero and as a continuous variable (with logarithm-
transformation) for positive CAC scores. Doppler and M-mode echocardiography were 
performed using an cardiac ultrasonographic scanner (Artida; Toshiba Medical Systems) 
with standardized protocols across all centers and offline imaging interpretation 
(Digisonics). Left ventricular (LV) mass was derived from the Devereux formula14 and 
indexed to height. Imaging for LV mass was performed at years 5 and 25. We defined LV 
hypertrophy, stratified by race and sex, as an LV mass at year 25 (indexing is to height raised 
to 2.7th power) that is at least 2 SDs above the year 5 echocardiographic LV mass (indexed 
by height raised to the 2.7 power). The cutoff was determined separately by race and sex. 
The speckle-tracking echocardiography images for myocardial strain measurements were 
analyzed in a 16-segment basis for the LV middle-wall layer using tracking software (Wall 
Motion 2-dimensional Tracking; Toshiba Medical Systems). Three cardiac cycles from each 
view were recorded for offline analyses. Strain was calculated as the change in segment 
length relative to its end diastolic length, and the peak systolic value was recorded.
Cardiovascular Outcomes
Definitions of all-cause mortality and cardiovascular events have been previously 
described.15-20 Participants were contacted annually to inquire about interim 
hospitalizations. For each event, medical records were obtained and adjudicated by 2 
morbidity and mortality committee members. For CVD events, we included nonfatal 
myocardial infarction or stroke; hospitalization for angina pectoris, congestive heart failure, 
or transient ischemic attack; revascularization for or demonstration of obstruction of carotid 
arteries or peripheral arterial disease on angiographic or ultrasonographic findings; and fatal

 atherosclerotic coronary heart disease, stroke, atherosclerotic disease other than coronary or 
stroke, or nonatherosclerotic cardiac disease. Participants who did not have events and who 
did not drop out of the study were censored at 27 years after the initial examination.
Statistical Analysis
Data were analyzed from study enrollment through August 31, 2011. Exercise test duration 
was modeled continuously or categorized into tertiles (across the entire cohort) in survival 
analyses. Cox proportional hazards regression was used to estimate hazard ratios (HRs) for 
CVD events and all-cause mortality. Logistic regression was used to obtain odds ratios for 
prevalent CAC at years 15, 20, and 25 and LV hypertrophy at year 25. Linear regression was 
used to model year 25 LV mass and global LV longitudinal strain and year 25 logarithm-
transformed CAC (for participants with a CAC score >0) as a function of treadmill test 
duration. Statistical models were adjusted for baseline (study entry [year 0]) age, race, sex, 
parental history of myocardial infarction (at younger than 60 years), BMI, systolic blood 
pressure, diabetes mellitus, smoking exposure (cigarettes per day), and high-density 
lipoprotein and total cholesterol levels. Additional Cox proportional hazards regression 
models for CVD events and all-cause mortality were run replacing baseline BMI, systolic 
blood pressure, diabetes mellitus, smoking exposure, and high-density lipoprotein and total 
cholesterol levels with time-dependent covariates updated at the years 2, 5, 7, 10, 15, 20, and 
25 examinations. In addition, given published data surrounding the importance of fitness in 
mitigating obesity-related risk,21 we included multiplicative interaction terms with 
categories of BMI to assess effect modification.
The 7-year change in CRF was computed by subtracting the baseline treadmill duration from 
the year 7 duration. Associations of fitness change with outcomes were assessed using 
similar statistical models as those described above but with additional adjustment for 
baseline treadmill duration and 7-year changes in BMI, systolic blood pressure, smoking 
exposure, high-density lipoprotein and total cholesterol levels, and incident diabetes 
mellitus. Participants who died before or did not attend the year 7 visit were excluded from 
the year 7 data analysis, and no remaining participants experienced a nonfatal CVD event 
before year 7.
All analyses were performed in SAS software (version 9.4; SAS Institute Inc). Two-tailed P 
values of less than .05 were considered statistically significant.
Results
Baseline characteristics of the 4872 study participants are shown in Table 1, stratified by 
tertile of baseline exercise duration. Overall, the mean age was 24.8 years, mean (SD) BMI 
was 24.5 (4.9), and 28 participants (0.6%) had diabetes mellitus. The CRF at baseline was 
associated with male sex, white race, greater self-reported physical activity, a lower BMI, 
and a favorable biochemical profile (lower fasting insulin and triglyceride levels at baseline).
During a median 26.9-year follow-up, 273 deaths (5.6%) and 193 CVD events (4.0%) 
occurred (the distribution of events is found in eTable 1 in the Supplement). Among the 
deaths, 200 (73.3%) were noncardiovascular in origin, with the greatest number of

 noncardiovascular deaths due to cancer (45 [22.5%]). In terms of subclinical CVD, 869 of 
3067 individuals (28.3%) had any CAC by year 25, and 324 of 3001 (10.8%) had LV 
hypertrophy (defined as above).
After full adjustment for age, race, sex, obesity, CVD risk factors, and LV mass index, each 
additional minute of baseline exercise test duration was associated with a 15% lower hazard 
of death (HR, 0.85; 95% CI, 0.80-0.91; P < .001) and a 12% lower hazard of CVD (HR, 
0.88; 95% CI, 0.81-0.96; P = .002) (model 2, Table 2). Exercise test duration was not 
associated with CAC at years 15, 20, and 25. After full adjustment, each 1-minute increase 
in exercise test duration was associated with a significantly reduced absolute LV mass index 
(β = −0.24; 95% CI, −0.45 to −0.03; P = .02) and significantly better global longitudinal 
strain, a measure of subclinical dysfunction (β = −0.09; 95% CI, −0.14 to −0.05; P < .001). 
Neither race nor sex modified the associations between exercise test duration and CAC, LV 
mass, or clinical outcome. Similarly, we found no interaction by baseline obesity status on 
most of these associations (eTable 2 in the Supplement; P > .05 for interaction).
To quantify whether short-term changes in CRF are associated with long-term prognosis and 
subclinical CVD, we investigated a subgroup of 2472 individuals with exercise testing 7 
years after initial treadmill testing. This subgroup undergoing a second treadmill test was 
representative of the overall study population in terms of clinical characteristics at study 
entry (eTable 3 in the Supplement). Median change in exercise test duration was −1.0 
(interquartile range, −2.03 to 0.08) minutes, with 308 individuals (12.5%) achieving at least 
a 1-minute improvement (increase) in CRF. After full adjustment (including baseline 
exercise duration and time-dependent obesity and CVD risk), each 1-minute reduction in 
exercise test duration from baseline to year 7 was associated with a 21% increase in all-
cause mortality in long-term follow-up (HR, 1.21; 95% CI, 1.07-1.37; P = .002) and a 20% 
increase in incident CVD (HR, 1.20; 95% CI, 1.06-1.37; P = .006). We did not observe any 
associations between changes in CRF during the 7 years and the presence of CAC at year 
15, 20, or 25 or LV hypertrophy at year 25. On the other hand, each 1-minute reduction in 
treadmill exercise duration was associated with an increase (worsening) in global 
longitudinal strain (P < .001) (Table 3). When stratified around 1 minute of decline in 
exercise duration, individuals who had a decline in exercise duration of greater than 1 
minute at year 7 had a significant reduction in long-term survival (P = .047) and CVD (P = .
02; Figure).
Discussion
In this large biracial cohort of young US adults with long-term follow-up, CRF was 
significantly associated with incident CVD and all-cause mortality independently of 
cardiometabolic and CVD risk factors. Lower LV mass and favorable global longitudinal 
strain (but not extent or development of CAC) 25 years after the index fitness evaluation 
were more likely in individuals with higher baseline fitness. The mean CRF declined during 
the initial 7 years in the CARDIA study, with each 1-minute decrease in fitness during 7 
years in early adulthood associated with a significant increase in the risk for long-term 
mortality, CVD, and subclinical LV dysfunction (by strain) but not CAC. These results 
suggest that CRF in young adulthood is a modifiable, prognostic biomarker of long-term

 mortality and CVD risk, with links to the development of abnormal myocardial structure and 
function but not CAC. Although the importance of CRF in determining clinical outcomes is 
well established, most large cohort investigations in this field have included middle-aged to 
older individuals (late 30s to early 50s in most landmark studies1-4), among whom 
subclinical and overt CVD may already be established and may influence outcomes.22 Given 
that young adults do not necessarily manifest the same subclinical disease or adverse events 
as these older populations, investigating the burden of CVD in young adults requires careful 
long-term follow-up to witness the development of subclinical CVD and adverse clinical 
outcomes.
These results establish that early fitness at an age younger than previously described is 
associated with a future risk for mortality and adverse cardiovascular events. The finding 
that fitness is related to development of subclinical changes in myocardial structure and 
function, but not CAC, sheds light on potential mechanistic benefits of exercise in youth not 
captured by CAC. We found that the effect of fitness on outcome could not be explained 
completely by BMI, changes in weight, or advancing cardiometabolic disease, suggesting 
that reductions in obesity and its consequences may not be the only mechanism of benefit of 
being fit early in adulthood. Finally, short-term changes in fitness in young adulthood had 
ramifications on risks for CVD and mortality independently of race, sex, BMI, changes in 
weight, and CVD-related risk factors, suggesting modifiability of fitness in personalized 
prevention.
We were surprised to find that fitness (or its change over time) was not associated with the 
extent or the presence of CAC in long-term follow-up. Exercise and fitness have been linked 
to endothelial function and vascular disease23 and progression of dyslipidemia and obesity,24 
which are risk factors for CVD. As such, the metrics of ideal cardiovascular health (eg, diet, 
risk factors, and physical activity) have been associated with a lower prevalence of CAC in 
cross-sectional25 and longitudinal studies,26 likely reflecting the cumulative burden of 
salutatory health habits on CVD pathogenesis. We did observe a prevalence of CAC (28.3% 
of study participants at year 25) similar to that of other studies in middle-aged adults (≤19% 
in individuals aged 40-46 years in the Cardiovascular Risk in Young Finns study27), which 
suggests a typical progression of subclinical CVD in the CARDIA study. Although 
published reports demonstrate heterogeneity regarding the effect of objectively measured 
CRF on CAC,28-30 the lack of association between CAC and point and serial measures of 
CRF in our study suggests that the cardiovascular benefits of fitness may extend beyond 
prevention of CAC and its progression. Exercise training may affect plaque composition31 
and systemic inflammatory markers linked to plaque rupture (eg, matrix 
metalloproteinases32), suggesting a role for non–CAC-dependent protection from CVD. 
Even among individuals without CAC, coronary vasodilator function can be abnormal and 
associated with adverse events, underscoring the presence of prognostically important 
coronary artery disease in the absence of CAC.33 Finally, emerging data suggest that statins 
(which stabilize coronary plaques) may actually promote CAC development,34 more 
evidence that—although an important biomarker of subclinical CVD—CAC may not fully 
capture the benefits of fitness on cardiovascular health.

 We also observed an association between fitness and its change early in adulthood with 
myocardial phenotypes late into follow-up—namely, cardiac mass and strain—which are 
both potent risk factors for incident CVD, specifically heart failure.35,36 Mechanistically, 
inflammation, insulin resistance, and endothelial dysfunction associated with lower levels of 
CRF have been linked to cardiac structural and functional remodeling,37 with increases in 
LV mass and reductions in strain predating heart failure.35 Although the younger CARDIA 
population is still accruing heart failure events, recognition of the effect of fitness in middle 
age on heart failure is emerging, with increments in exercise capacity in middle age 
associated with reduction in incident hospitalization for heart failure38 and lower levels of 
fitness associated with myocardial dysfunction.39 These data provide evidence that in the 
earliest stages of risk factor development, fitness may be a powerful, independent predictor 
of subclinical myocardial remodeling, suggesting a potential role for fitness as a prognostic 
and therapeutic tool against myocardial dysfunction and heart failure.40
The CARDIA study has a large biracial cohort with long follow-up and extensive data on 
confounding variables and detailed cardiovascular and metabolic phenotyping. Nevertheless, 
the results of this study have some limitations in light of its design. The possibility that the 
relationship between higher CRF and outcome may be confounded by unmeasured factors 
related to a generally more salutatory lifestyle (eg, improved diet41) may still exist; however, 
we performed time-dependent adjustments for hypertension, diabetes mellitus, and obesity
—all metrics of cardiovascular and general health—to limit this possibility. Although these 
adjustments include confounders and mediators of fitness-related benefits for CVD, this 
approach yielded significant associations between CRF and cardiovascular structure and 
outcome, which suggests the robustness of CRF as an independent predictor. Although we 
used treadmill test duration as the primary measure of CRF (as opposed to assessments of 
peak aerobic capacity), this approach is widely available and clinically generalizable. We 
focused on serial fitness from baseline to 7 years as opposed to fitness assessments into 
middle age (eg, year 20) in the CARDIA study. Although this approach may limit our ability 
to detect the importance of evolution in CRF between early adulthood to middle age, our 
aim was to focus on CRF changes early in life in the CARDIA study during a time when 
increasing obesity and risk factors (but not clinical CVD) evolve. The CARDIA study 
assessed LV mass and strain at year 25, thereby potentially missing intermediate temporal 
changes during which more subtle phenotypes may emerge. However, the associations 
between CRF early in adulthood with very long-term cardiac structure and function are 
strong evidence of the long-lasting effect of CRF on myocardial disease.
Conclusions
In a large study of young adults without clinical CVD, we demonstrate a strong association 
between absolute fitness and changes in fitness early in adult life on long-term mortality 
independently of obesity or other indices of metabolic or CVD risk. Fitness was associated 
with cardiac remodeling but not CAC, which suggests that traditional indices of 
atherosclerotic CVD progression may not completely explain fitness-related benefits on 
cardiovascular health. Early measures of CRF represent a quantifiable, prognostic, and 
mechanistically relevant biomarker of survival in early adulthood. Efforts to evaluate and
