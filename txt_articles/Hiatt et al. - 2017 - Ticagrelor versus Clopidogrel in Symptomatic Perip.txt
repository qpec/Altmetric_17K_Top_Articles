BACKGROUND
Peripheral artery disease is considered to be a manifestation of systemic athero-
sclerosis with associated adverse cardiovascular and limb events. Data from previ-
ous trials have suggested that patients receiving clopidogrel monotherapy had a 
lower risk of cardiovascular events than those receiving aspirin. We wanted to 
compare clopidogrel with ticagrelor, a potent antiplatelet agent, in patients with 
peripheral artery disease.
METHODS
In this double-blind, event-driven trial, we randomly assigned 13,885 patients with 
symptomatic peripheral artery disease to receive monotherapy with ticagrelor (90 mg 
twice daily) or clopidogrel (75 mg once daily). Patients were eligible if they had an 
ankle–brachial index (ABI) of 0.80 or less or had undergone previous revascular-
ization of the lower limbs. The primary efficacy end point was a composite of adju-
dicated cardiovascular death, myocardial infarction, or ischemic stroke. The pri-
mary safety end point was major bleeding. The median follow-up was 30 months.
RESULTS
The median age of the patients was 66 years, and 72% were men; 43% were en-
rolled on the basis of the ABI and 57% on the basis of previous revascularization. 
The mean baseline ABI in all patients was 0.71, 76.6% of the patients had claudi-
cation, and 4.6% had critical limb ischemia. The primary efficacy end point oc-
curred in 751 of 6930 patients (10.8%) receiving ticagrelor and in 740 of 6955 (10.6%) 
receiving clopidogrel (hazard ratio, 1.02; 95% confidence interval [CI], 0.92 to 1.13; 
P 
= 
0.65). In each group, acute limb ischemia occurred in 1.7% of the patients 
(hazard ratio, 1.03; 95% CI, 0.79 to 1.33; P 
= 
0.85) and major bleeding in 1.6% 
(hazard ratio, 1.10; 95% CI, 0.84 to 1.43; P 
= 
0.49).
CONCLUSIONS
In patients with symptomatic peripheral artery disease, ticagrelor was not shown to 
be superior to clopidogrel for the reduction of cardiovascular events. Major bleed-
ing occurred at similar rates among the patients in the two trial groups. (Funded 
by AstraZeneca; EUCLID ClinicalTrials.gov number, NCT01732822.)

Ticagrelor vs. Clopidogrel in Peripheral Artery Disease
P
eripheral artery disease is consid-
ered to be a clinical manifestation of sys-
temic atherosclerosis affecting the vascular 
territories supplying the lower limbs. Most patients 
presenting with peripheral artery disease do not 
have a clinical history of cardiac or cerebral isch-
emic events, yet these patients are at high risk for 
myocardial infarction, ischemic stroke, and car-
diovascular death.1 Concomitant clinical evidence 
of coronary or cerebrovascular disease only mag-
nifies this risk.2
Therapies to reduce the ischemic risk associ-
ated with atherosclerosis have focused on patients 
with acute coronary syndromes and stable coro-
nary artery disease. Antithrombotic drugs, mainly 
antiplatelet therapies and statins, are the corner-
stone of care. There have been no large trials 
focusing on patients with peripheral artery dis-
ease, which has led to limited direct evidence to 
support any guideline recommendations for spe-
cific antiplatelet therapies in such patients.3,4 
Clopidogrel monotherapy has been shown to be 
more effective than aspirin monotherapy in re-
ducing cardiovascular events in a subgroup of 
patients with peripheral artery disease in a com-
parison with patients with other forms of stable 
cardiovascular disease.3
Ticagrelor, an inhibitor of platelet P2Y12 recep-
tor, has shown evidence of benefit among pa-
tients with acute coronary syndromes and stable 
coronary artery disease, as defined by a history 
of myocardial infarction.5,6 Concomitant pe-
ripheral artery disease in patients with an acute 
coronary syndrome event increases the risk of 
subsequent cardiovascular events. In a recent trial 
involving patients with acute coronary syndromes, 
ticagrelor resulted in a relative risk reduction simi-
lar to the reduction in the overall trial, but the drug 
was associated with a larger absolute risk reduc-
tion in a comparison with patients who had an 
acute coronary syndrome without peripheral artery 
disease.7 In another clinical trial, patients with a 
history of myocardial infarction and concomitant 
peripheral artery disease also had a greater risk of 
cardiovascular events and a greater absolute risk 
reduction with ticagrelor than did patients with 
previous myocardial infarction alone.8 On the basis 
of previous observations and the need to develop 
evidence for specific therapies, we performed the 
Examining Use of Ticagrelor in Peripheral Artery 
Disease (EUCLID) trial to test the hypothesis that 
monotherapy with ticagrelor would be superior 
to therapy with clopidogrel in preventing cardio-
vascular death, myocardial infarction, or ischemic 
stroke in patients with symptomatic peripheral 
artery disease.
Methods
Trial Design
The details regarding the study design for our trial 
have been published previously.9 Briefly, this was a 
double-blind, active-comparator clinical trial in-
volving 13,885 patients with symptomatic periph-
eral artery disease at 811 sites in 28 countries. 
(Details are provided in the Supplementary Ap-
pendix, available with the full text of this article 
at NEJM.org.) The trial was designed by an inde-
pendent executive committee that included mem-
bers from the Duke Clinical Research Institute, 
the Colorado Prevention Center at the University 
of Colorado, and AstraZeneca, the trial sponsor. 
An international steering committee was respon-
sible for oversight of local study sites and includ-
ed national lead investigators from each country. 
All primary efficacy and safety end points were 
adjudicated by an independent clinical events 
committee in a blinded fashion. An independent 
data and safety monitoring committee provided 
safety oversight and performed one formal in-
terim analysis after 798 primary events had been 
adjudicated.
The Duke Clinical Research Institute held the 
clinical database and conducted all analyses for 
publication independent of the sponsor. The first 
draft of the manuscript was written by the first 
and last authors, and all the coauthors participated 
in the oversight of the trial and in the preparation 
of all subsequent drafts of the manuscript. The 
executive committee and authors assume respon-
sibility for the accuracy and completeness of the 
data and all analyses, as well as the fidelity of this 
trial to the protocol and statistical analysis plan 
(available at NEJM.org). AstraZeneca provided fi-
nancial support for the conduct of the study.
Study Population
Eligible patients were at least 50 years of age 
with symptomatic peripheral artery disease. Pa-
tients were required to have one of two inclusion 
criteria: previous revascularization of the lower 
limbs for symptomatic disease more than 30 days 
before randomization or hemodynamic evidence 
of peripheral artery disease, as evidenced by an

ankle–brachial index (ABI) of 0.80 or less at 
screening. (The ABI is the ratio of the systolic 
blood pressure in the ankle to the blood pressure 
in the upper arm, with lower values indicating 
possible narrowing of the arteries in the legs.) For 
patients qualifying for enrollment on the basis 
of the ABI criterion, the measure was repeated at 
the randomization visit and required a value 0.85 
or less to ensure that patients had reproducible 
evidence of substantial atherosclerotic disease 
burden. In patients with an ABI of 1.40 or more 
(an indication of calcification of the tibial arte-
rial wall and stiffening of the vessel), the ankle 
systolic pressures are falsely elevated. In that 
situation, the toe–brachial index (TBI), the ratio 
of the systolic blood pressure in the large toe to 
the blood pressure in the upper arm, was used if 
the value was 0.60 or less at screening and 0.65 
or less at randomization. Key exclusion criteria 
included current or planned use of dual anti-
platelet therapy or aspirin, an increased risk of 
bleeding, treatment with long-term anticoagula-
tion, or a poor clopidogrel metabolizer status for 
the cytochrome P-450 2C19 allele, defined as a 
genotype with two loss-of-function alleles. All 
the patients provided written informed consent 
for participation.
Randomization and Study Treatment
Patients underwent randomization in a 1:1 ratio 
in a double-blind fashion to receive either ticagre-
lor (90 mg twice daily) or clopidogrel (75 mg once 
daily). Randomization was performed with the use 
of an interactive voice-response or Web-response 
system.
End Points
The primary efficacy end point was the first oc-
currence of any event in the composite of cardio-
vascular death, myocardial infarction, or ischemic 
stroke (defined as any stroke not shown to be pri-
marily hemorrhagic). Secondary end points were 
tested in a hierarchical fashion beginning with 
the primary end point plus acute limb ischemia 
leading to hospitalization. The primary safety end 
point was major bleeding, according to Throm-
bolysis in Myocardial Infarction (TIMI) criteria.
Statistical Analysis
We determined that a sample size of 11,500 pa-
tients and 1596 primary end points would pro-
vide a power of 90% to determine the superior-
ity of ticagrelor over clopidogrel, assuming that 
the primary end point would occur in 7% of the 
patients in the clopidogrel group annually and 
that the patients in the ticagrelor group would 
have a 15% lower relative risk than those in the 
clopidogrel group (i.e., hazard ratio, 0.85) at a 
4.94% significance level that was adjusted for 
one interim analysis.9 However, given a lower-than-
expected primary-event rate, the sample size was 
increased to approximately 13,500 patients and 
the power was decreased to 85%, which required 
a minimum of 1364 primary end-point events.
The primary and secondary efficacy analyses 
were performed according to the intention-to-
treat principle and included all the patients who 
had undergone randomization, regardless of ad-
herence to the protocol or study-drug assignment 
and of continued participation in the study. Pa-
tients who withdrew consent to participate in 
the study were included up to the date of with-
drawal, with the exception of the analysis of death 
from any cause, in which we included information 
from all the patients for whom vital status could 
be determined from public records at the end of 
the study. The safety analyses included all the pa-
tients who received at least one dose of a trial drug 
during the treatment period, which was defined as 
up to 7 days after the last dose of a trial drug.
We used a Cox proportional-hazards model to 
analyze the primary and secondary time-to-event 
analyses with a factor for the treatment group. 
P values and confidence intervals for the hazard 
ratios were based on the Wald statistic. We cal-
culated Kaplan–Meier estimates of the cumula-
tive proportion of patients with events, with the 
number of patients at risk indicated below the 
plot at specific time points. No multiplicity ad-
justment was made to confidence intervals, and 
all P values were unadjusted.
In efficacy time-to-event analyses, we censored 
data for patients in whom the event in question 
had not occurred at either the censoring date for 
the primary analysis or the last trial contact when 
all components of the end point in question were 
assessed, whichever came first.
Results
Patients
From December 2012 through March 2014, a total 
of 16,237 patients were enrolled and screened for 
randomization. A total of 13,885 patients under-
went randomization and were followed for the 
occurrence of the composite primary events

Ticagrelor vs. Clopidogrel in Peripheral Artery Disease
through May 9, 2016. At the completion of the 
trial, vital status was unknown for 14 patients; 
of these patients, 5 were lost to follow-up (Fig. 1). 
The median follow-up was approximately 30 
months.
The characteristics of the patients were well 
balanced in the two groups (Table 1). The me-
dian age of the patients was 66 years, and 72% 
were male. Enrollment was based on an abnor-
mal ABI or TBI in 6010 patients (43%) and on 
previous revascularization in 7875 (57%). The mean 
baseline ABI in all the patients was 0.71, and the 
ABI according to recruitment stratum is presented 
in Table 1. The majority of patients had claudica-
tion (76.6%), 4.6% had critical limb ischemia, and 
18.7% were asymptomatic. (Among the asymp-
tomatic patients, 95% had undergone previous 
revascularization for symptomatic disease.)
Efficacy End Points
The primary efficacy composite end point of car-
diovascular death, myocardial infarction, or isch-
emic stroke occurred in 751 of 6930 patients 
(10.8%) in the ticagrelor group and in 740 of 6955 
(10.6%) in the clopidogrel group (hazard ratio, 
1.02; 95% confidence interval [CI], 0.92 to 1.13; 
Figure 1. Enrollment and Outcomes.
Patients could have more than one reason for exclusion from the study. The exclusion category of “other reasons” 
includes no provision of informed consent by the patient, potential nonadherence, an interval of less than 3 months 
since revascularization, an age of under 50 years, and a decision by the principal investigator to withdraw the patient 
from the trial.

The ankle–brachial index (ABI) and toe–brachial index (TBI) were calculated as the average of measurements obtained at enrollment and at 
randomization, in which the lowest of the right­side values and left­side values were selected at each visit. Among the patients who were in­
cluded in the trial on the basis of ABI or TBI criteria, the enrollment of 82 patients (1.2%) in the ticagrelor group and 93 (1.3%) in the clo­
pid 
ogrel group was based on TBI criteria.
‡  
Limb symptoms were categorized with the use of the Rutherford classification. Data were missing for one patient in the ticagrelor group 
and two in the clopidogrel group. Asymptomatic status refers to the patient’s status at the time of randomization, although patients with a 
history of revascularization may have been asymptomatic at baseline. Minor tissue loss includes ischemic ulceration not exceeding ulcer of 
the digits of the foot. Major tissue loss includes severe ischemic ulcers or frank gangrene.
§  
Major amputation includes above­the­knee and transtibial amputations.
¶  
Coronary artery disease is defined as myocardial infarction, percutaneous coronary intervention, or coronary­artery bypass grafting (CABG).
‖  
An affected vascular bed was defined by the presence of peripheral artery disease, coronary artery disease, or cerebrovascular disease (in­
cluding previous stroke, transient ischemic attack, carotid­artery stenosis, or carotid revascularization).

Ticagrelor vs. Clopidogrel in Peripheral Artery Disease
P 
= 
0.65) (Fig. 2). The only significant between-
group difference was in the rate of ischemic stroke, 
which occurred in 1.9% of the patients in the 
ticagrelor group, versus 2.4% in the clopidogrel 
group (hazard ratio, 0.78; 95% CI, 0.62 to 0.98; 
P 
= 
0.03) (Table 2).
Other key secondary and composite end points 
including acute limb ischemia and revasculariza-
tion were similar in the two groups (Table 2). 
Overall efficacy findings were consistent among 
all subgroups, with the exception of patients who 
had undergone previous coronary or carotid re-
vascularization or previous coronary stenting, in 
whom an interaction favoring ticagrelor was ob-
served (Fig. S1 in the Supplementary Appendix). 
Kaplan–Meier curves for the rates of death from 
cardiovascular causes and all causes are provided 
in Figures S2 and S3 in the Supplementary Ap-
pendix.
Safety End Points
The primary safety end point, TIMI major bleed-
ing, occurred in 1.6% of the patients in both the 
ticagrelor group and the clopidogrel group (haz-
ard ratio, 1.10; 95% CI, 0.84 to 1.43; P 
= 
0.49) 
(Fig. S4 in the Supplementary Appendix). The rates 
of fatal bleeding, intracranial bleeding, and TIMI 
minor bleeding were similar in the two groups 
(Table 3). There were numerically fewer fatal 
bleeding events in the ticagrelor group than in 
the clopidogrel group (10 vs. 20), but there were 
significantly more bleeding events leading to 
discontinuation with ticagrelor than with clo 
pid-
ogrel (168 vs. 112; P<0.001) (Table 3). Ticagrelor 
was prematurely discontinued more often than 
clopidogrel during the study (in 30.1% of pa-
tients vs. in 25.9%; hazard ratio, 1.21; 95% CI, 
1.14 to 1.29; P<0.001); discontinuation was driven 
mainly by the occurrence of dyspnea (4.8% in 
the ticagrelor group vs. 0.8% in the clopidogrel 
group) and any bleeding event that was document-
ed by the investigator on a case-report form (2.4% 
vs. 1.6%, P<0.001 for both comparisons). Overall, 
the TIMI major bleeding events were few and gen-
erally consistent among subgroups (Fig. S5 in the 
Supplementary Appendix). Additional informa-
tion about adverse events is provided in Tables 
S1 through S3 in the Supplementary Appendix.
Discussion
In our study involving patients with peripheral 
artery disease, we found that monotherapy with 
ticagrelor was not superior to clopidogrel in re-

ducing the rate of cardiovascular events; the rate 
of major bleeding was similar in the two groups. 
There was also no significant between-group dif-
ference in a key secondary end point of acute limb 
ischemia. Patients receiving ticagrelor discontin-
ued treatment more often than did those receiv-
ing clopidogrel, mainly because of dyspnea and 
minor bleeding, which are well-described adverse 
effects of the drug.
These overall findings should be placed in the 
context of what was known before we conducted 
the EUCLID trial. Antiplatelet therapy is consid-
ered to be a critical component of the management 
of cardiovascular risk in patients with peripheral 
artery disease. However, this recommendation is 
based on limited data regarding two antiplatelet 
agents — aspirin and clopidogrel. Specifically, 
patients receiving aspirin had a modest 12% 
lower risk of cardiovascular events than those 
receiving placebo in a meta-analysis involving ap-
proximately 5000 patients.10 In two large clinical 
trials, patients with asymptomatic atherosclerosis 
(which was defined as an abnormal ABI value) 
were randomly assigned to receive aspirin or pla-
cebo.11,12 In those trials, aspirin was not superior 
to placebo in preventing cardiovascular events. In 
the randomized Clopidogrel versus Aspirin in Pa-
tients at Risk of Ischemic Events (CAPRIE) trial,3 
investigators compared clopidogrel with aspirin 
monotherapy in a broadly defined stable popula-
tion of patients with atherosclerotic disease, in-
cluding coronary artery disease, peripheral artery 
disease, and cerebrovascular disease. The overall 
trial showed a significant benefit for clopidogrel 
over aspirin that was driven mainly by the sub-
group of patients with peripheral artery disease, 
in whom there was a 23.8% risk reduction. These 
results from CAPRIE established clopidogrel as 
the first therapy for peripheral artery disease to be 
approved by the Food and Drug Administration. In 
the Clopidogrel for High Atherothrombotic Risk 
and Ischemic Stabilization, Management, and 
Avoidance (CHARISMA) trial, investigators who 
compared aspirin plus clopidogrel with aspirin 
monotherapy in a broad, high-risk population of 
patients with atherosclerosis found no significant 
benefit for clopidogrel in the risk of cardiovascular 
events in the overall population; however, there

Ticagrelor vs. Clopidogrel in Peripheral Artery Disease
was a nonsignificant trend in the subgroup of pa-
tients with peripheral artery disease.13 Dual an-
tiplatelet therapy was associated with an increased 
risk of bleeding.13 On the basis of this evidence, 
clopidogrel monotherapy has been the preferred 
therapy to manage the atherothrombotic risk in 
patients with peripheral artery disease.
In the Study of Platelet Inhibition and Patient 
Outcomes (PLATO), in which investigators com-
pared ticagrelor with clopidogrel in patients receiv-
ing aspirin (dual antiplatelet therapy), they found 
that ticagrelor was superior in reducing the rate 
of cardiovascular events in patients with acute 
coronary syndromes.5 In the Prior Heart Attack 
Using Ticagrelor Compared to Placebo on a Back-
ground of Aspirin–Thrombolysis in Myocardial 
Infarction 54 (PEGASUS-TIMI 54) study involving 
patients with previous myocardial infarction, ti-
cagrelor was more effective than placebo among 
patients receiving aspirin (dual antiplatelet ther-
apy vs. aspirin monotherapy) in reducing the rate 
of cardiovascular events.6 In both the PLATO and 
PEGASUS trials, the presence of concomitant 
peripheral artery disease was associated with an 
increased risk of ischemic events and with a con-
sistent benefit for ticagrelor in comparisons with 
the overall trial populations.7,8 Given the evidence, 
ticagrelor was considered to be a potent agent with 
potential benefit in patients with peripheral ar-
tery disease.
In light of the previous study results, how can 
we interpret the findings of similar treatment ef-
fects for ticagrelor and clopidogrel in the EUCLID 
trial? A major consideration is that clopidogrel 
represents an effective active comparator. In our 
trial, we excluded patients who were homozygous 
for loss-of-function alleles to clopidogrel before 
randomization. Furthermore, the results of the 
CAPRIE trial suggest that clopidogrel may be par-
ticularly effective in patients with peripheral ar-
tery disease. In addition, the patients in our 
trial were enrolled on the basis of having periph-
eral artery disease, with a minority having con-
comitant clinical coronary artery disease. These 
patients may have important phenotypic and bio-
logic differences from those with predominantly 
acute and chronic coronary artery disease.14 Fi-
nally, patients with peripheral artery disease may 
have competing risks and drivers of clinical 
events.
These findings should inform the field of vas-
cular medicine. Given the similar rates of cardio-
vascular and bleeding events in our two trial 
groups, ticagrelor and clopidogrel appear to be 
similar in patients with peripheral artery disease, 
although the occurrence of side effects prompted 
more discontinuations of ticagrelor than of clopid-
ogrel. In addition, our findings show the hazards 
of extrapolating evidence from patients with coro-
nary artery disease to those with peripheral artery 
disease. In our trial, the observed cardiovascular 
event rates in the two groups (4.42% per 100 pa-
tient-years) combined with the rates of acute limb 
ischemia (0.83% per 100 patient-years) show the

A total of 30.1% of patients in the ticagrelor group and 25.9% in the clopidogrel group prematurely discontinued the 
assigned study drug during follow­up. Included in this group were patients who discontinued the study drug because 
of adverse events, those in whom the primary end point occurred, and those who died.

This category includes adverse events leading to the permanent discontinuation of a study drug because of a bleeding 
event that was documented by the investigator on a case­report form; these events included unadjudicated minimal 
bleeding.

Ticagrelor vs. Clopidogrel in Peripheral Artery Disease
need for continued clinical improvement. There-
fore, future trials should evaluate well-defined 
populations of patients with peripheral artery 
disease, including those with stable disease and 
those who have undergone revascularization. 
Finally, the risks and harms of combinations of 
antithrombotic therapies need to be evaluated 
prospectively, particularly when such drugs are 
used in patients who have undergone revascular-
ization, in whom drugs and devices are used 
together to treat symptomatic disease.
Some limitations of our trial should be not-
ed. Aspirin was not included in the trial because 
of constraints involved in the feasibility of con-
ducting a three-group study and complications 
in blinding when dual antiplatelet therapy would 
be clinically needed after randomization. There-
fore, we cannot draw direct conclusions about 
the effect of the studied agents as compared 
with aspirin among patients with peripheral 
artery disease who were enrolled in our study. 
However, as previously noted, clopidogrel was 
the agent of choice, given the available evidence 
showing its nominal superiority over aspirin in 
a broad population of patients with atheroscle-
rosis, especially since the effect was driven by 
the result in patients with peripheral artery 
disease.3
In conclusion, in patients with symptomatic 
peripheral artery disease, ticagrelor was not su-
perior to clopidogrel for the reduction of cardio-
vascular events, and each drug was associated 
with similar rates of major bleeding. However, 
ticagrelor was discontinued more frequently than 
clopidogrel because of the occurrence of side ef-
fects (mainly dyspnea and minor bleeding).
