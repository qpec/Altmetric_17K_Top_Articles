*When an HBsAg test result is reactive, laboratories may automatically perform a confirmatory test without 
additional provider order.
**This CPT code corresponds only to the HBsAg screening component of this laboratory panel; additional 
CPT codes might be associated with other component tests in this laboratory panel.
Notes: CDC recommends healthcare providers use prenatal HBsAg tests (vs. non-specific tests) for 
pregnant women, which allows for reporting of positive results along with pregnancy status to public health 
jurisdictions. Refer all HBsAg positive pregnant women to Perinatal Hepatitis B Prevention Program 
coordinators for case management of mother and infant:  
http://www.cdc.gov/vaccines/vpd-vac/hepb/perinatal-contacts.htm. 
Laboratories reserve the right to add, modify, or stop performing tests at any time – providers should review 
any test notifications from laboratories for changes.

 Screening and Referral Algorithm for Hepatitis B 
Virus (HBV) Infection among Pregnant Women
•  
Report HBsAg positive 
pregnant women to 
Perinatal Hepatitis B 
Prevention Program
•  
Identify all household and 
sexual contacts and 
recommend screening by 
primary care provider
No

• Consider 
vaccination during 
pregnancy  
or postpartum
•  
Repeat HBsAg 
testing when 
admitted for 
delivery
HBV DNA 
 
>20,000 
IU/mL
ALT  
≥19 IU/L
Refer to specialist 
immediately  
during pregnancy
Refer 
for care 
postpartum
HBsAg
HBsAg
Order Additional Tests: 
• HBeAg (hepatitis B e-antigen)
• HBV DNA Concentration
• ALT (alanine aminotransferase)
No further  
action  
needed
HBeAg
or
or
HBsAg  
(hepatitis B  
surface antigen)
Assess if at high 
risk* for acquiring 
HBV infection
 
*High risk for HBV infection includes: household or sexual contacts of HBsAg-positive 
persons; injection drug use; more than one sex partner during the past six months; evaluation 
or treatment for a sexually transmitted disease; HIV infection, chronic liver disease, or 
end-stage renal disease; and international travel to regions with HBsAg prevalence of ≥2%.
