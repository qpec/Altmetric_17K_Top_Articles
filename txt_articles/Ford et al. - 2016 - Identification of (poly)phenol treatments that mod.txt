Abstract
Diets rich in fruits and vegetables (FV), which contain (poly)phenols, protect against age-related inflammation and chronic diseases.
T-lymphocytes contribute to systemic cytokine production and are modulated by FV intake. Little is known about the relative potency of
different (poly)phenols in modulating cytokine release by lymphocytes. We compared thirty-one (poly)phenols and six (poly)phenol mixtures
for effects on pro-inflammatory cytokine release by Jurkat T-lymphocytes. Test compounds were incubated with Jurkat cells for 48 h at 1 and
30 µM, with or without phorbol ester treatment at 24 h to induce cytokine release. Three test compounds that reduced cytokine release were
further incubated with primary lymphocytes at 0·2 and 1 µM for 24 h, with lipopolysaccharide added at 5 h. Cytokine release was measured,
and generation of H2O2 by test compounds was determined to assess any potential correlations with cytokine release. A number of (poly)
phenols significantly altered cytokine release from Jurkat cells (P < 0·05), but H2O2 generation did not correlate with cytokine release.
Resveratrol, isorhamnetin, curcumin, vanillic acid and specific (poly)phenol mixtures reduced pro-inflammatory cytokine release from
T-lymphocytes, and there was evidence for interaction between (poly)phenols to further modulate cytokine release. The release of interferon-
γ induced protein 10 by primary lymphocytes was significantly reduced following treatment with 1 µM isorhamnetin (P < 0·05). These results
suggest that (poly)phenols derived from onions, turmeric, red grapes, green tea and açai berries may help reduce the release of pro-
inflammatory mediators in people at risk of chronic inflammation.

(Poly)phenols, comprising flavonoids and related compounds,
are produced by plants that are widely consumed in the human
diet. A high dietary intake of fruits and vegetables, which are
rich in (poly)phenols, has been linked through epidemiological
studies with reduced risk for diseases that are associated
with age-related chronic inflammation, including CVD(1–3),
type II diabetes(4,5), cancers(6–9), Alzheimer’s disease(10) and
Parkinson’s disease(11). Supplementation with (poly)phenol-
rich foods or purified (poly)phenols has been reported to
reduce levels of pro-inflammatory cytokines in the human
circulation, including TNFα and IL-6, cytokines that have been
implicated
in
the
pathogenesis
of
chronic
inflammatory
diseases(12–14). T-lymphocytes significantly contribute to the
release of pro- and anti-inflammatory cytokines both into the
circulation and within tissues. Dietary (poly)phenols may
influence the behaviour of T-lymphocytes and other cells via
redox signalling, that is the production or quenching of free
radicals, or by interactions with specific proteins(15). The
production of H2O2 by (poly)phenols through autoxidation
catalysed by transition metals is known to influence the beha-
viour of cells in culture(16,17), but the effects of (poly)phenol-
induced H2O2 generation on T-lymphocytes and the relevance
of this in the modulation of cytokine release are not well
understood. A majority of (poly)phenols have low bioavail-
ability in vivo as parent compounds(18,19); therefore, recent
interest has been focused on metabolites of dietary (poly)
phenols, including the methylated, glucuronidated, and sulphated
conjugates that are produced by intestinal and liver cells, and the
aromatic acids produced by the colonic bacterial flora(20–22).
We aimed to compare thirty-one individual (poly)phenols for
their effects on the release of inflammatory cytokines by Jurkat
CD4+ T-lymphocytes. We examined some key dietary (poly)

 phenols and a number of metabolites, including specifically a
substantial number of low molecular weight colonic catabolites.
Following
this
initial
screen,
three
anti-inflammatory
compounds were selected for further investigation of their
effects on cytokine release by primary peripheral blood
mononuclear cell (PBMC)-derived human lymphocytes. We
further aimed to assess the generation of H2O2 in cell culture
media by these (poly)phenols and to assess whether H2O2
generation significantly influences cytokine release or growth of
Jurkat CD4+ T-lymphocytes in vitro. The question of the most
appropriate doses of (poly)phenols to be used in in vitro
studies is controversial within the field. Following dietary
intake, (poly)phenols and the individual metabolites/catabolites
can be detected in the circulation with Cmax values generally at
nM or low µM concentrations, whereas following supplementa-
tion with purified compounds or enriched food extracts values
of up to 20–50 µM have been reported. For an individual with
a typical dietary intake of multiple fruits and vegetables,
numerous (poly)phenol metabolites/catabolites coexist in the
circulation at any one time. Whether mixtures of different (poly)
phenols, each present at low doses, interact in their effects on
cytokine release by lymphocytes has not been clear. We
therefore also investigated the effects of six different mixtures of
(poly)phenols on the release of pro-inflammatory cytokines by
Jurkat T-lymphocytes, in order to determine whether multiple
(poly)phenols at lower doses have additive or potentially
synergistic effects compared with those of single (poly)phenols.

Cell culture and treatments
Jurkat E6·1 human CD4+ T-lymphocytes obtained from the
Health Protection Authority, UK, were cultured routinely at
37°C in a humidified 5 % CO2 incubator in Roswell Park
Memorial Institute (RPMI)-1640 medium containing phenol red
supplemented with 10 % fetal bovine serum (FBS) and 2 mM-L-
glutamine. Jurkat cells were seeded at 2 × 106 cells/ml in a forty-
eight-well plate (500 µl culture volume) and treated with each
test compound at 1 or 30 μmol/l by dilution from 5 mM stocks in
dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO). The same volume of DMSO only
was added to vehicle control wells. After 24 h of incubation with
test compounds, 25 ng/ml phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate
(PMA) by 1:1000 dilution from a 25 µg/ml DMSO stock solution
and 5 μg/ml phytohaemagglutinin (PHA) by 1:1000 dilution
from a 5 mg/ml stock solution in water were added to some
wells, and vehicle controls were treated with DMSO at 1:1000
dilution. Typically, the equivalent volume of DMSO added to
each well was 0·5 µl. Co-treatment with PMA (a protein kinase C
activator) and PHA (a T-cell receptor cross-linking agent)
has been widely used to stimulate cytokine production by
T-lymphocytes(23). Following PMA/PHA treatment, plates were
incubated for 24 h at 37°C and 5% CO2. Test compounds were not
removed during PMA/PHA treatment, and thus the total incuba-
tion period with each (poly)phenol was 48 h. Each treatment was
performed in quadruplicate alongside matched vehicle controls.
Mixed (poly)phenol treatments were conducted using the same
protocol, except that each of the four compounds in each mixture
was added at either 0·25 or 7·5µM, thus achieving either a 1 or
30 µM total concentration of (poly)phenols.
Measurement of viable cell number
Following incubations with test compounds and stimulation
agents, cell numbers were quantified by transferring 100 μl cell
suspension from each well to a flat-bottomed, clear, ninety-
six-well plate. A sample of 20 ml of 3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-
5-(3-carboxymethoxyphenyl)-2-(4-sulfophenyl)-2H-tetrazolium,
inner salt and phenazine methosulfate reagent (Promega)
was added to each well and the plate was incubated for 90 min
at 37°C and 5 % CO2. Following incubation, absorbance was
read at 490 nm on a BMG Labtech Spectrostar Nano plate
reader. Viable cell numbers were estimated from a standard
curve determined by haemocytometer counting with 0·02 %
(w/v) trypan blue stain.
Primary lymphocyte isolation, cell culture and treatment
Primary human lymphocytes were obtained from a healthy
45-year-old female donor after obtaining written consent, by
withdrawal of 50 ml blood from the antecubital vein using a
butterfly needle and syringe. The procedure was approved by
the National Research Ethics service, UK (reference 11/NW/
0313), as well as by the University of Liverpool and Royal
Liverpool and Broadgreen University Hospitals NHS Trust ethics
committees. Whole blood was separated over Ficoll-Paque

pended in FBS containing 10 % DMSO and cryogenically stored.
The PBMC were later thawed, washed once in medium

L-glutamine) to remove DMSO, resuspended in the same
medium and then cultured at 37°C and 5 % CO2 in a T25 tissue
culture flask laid horizontally. After 5 d of incubation to allow
monocytes to adhere to the culture flask, the lymphocyte-
enriched suspension cells were seeded to a forty-eight-well
plate at 2 × 106 cells/ml in 150 µl total volume. After 24 h of
incubation at 37°C/5 % CO2, the lymphocytes were treated with
test compounds (resveratrol, isorhamnetin and curcumin)
diluted from 5 mmol/l DMSO stocks to a final concentration of
either 0·2 or 1 µmol/l, or the same volume of DMSO only as the
vehicle control. Lymphocytes were incubated for 5 h at
37°C/5 % CO2; next, 20 ng/ml lipopolysaccharide (LPS) was
added without removing media and the cells were incubated for
a further 19 h. Following the total 24 h of incubation, cell
numbers and viability were determined by trypan blue staining

 (0·02 % w/v final concentration trypan blue; TC-20 automated
cell counter, Bio-Rad) and media were harvested for quantifica-
tion of cytokines.
Quantification of cytokines in lymphocyte cell culture media
Cells were pelleted by centrifugation at 400 g for 5 min. The
culture media supernatants were immediately frozen at −80°C
and remained frozen until they were thawed for analysis using a
BioPlex 200 multi-protein analysis platform (Bio-Rad) and BioPlex
bead sets targeting the human cytokine analytes detailed in
Table 1. The analysis was performed according to the manu-
facturer’s instructions. All reagents were purchased from Bio-Rad.
Cytokine concentrations were calculated by comparing raw
fluorescence emission values with a standard curve diluted
from a solution of mixed recombinant cytokine proteins
(Bio-Rad). Cytokine concentrations were then normalised for
the number of viable cells in the culture at the end of treatment,
as quantified by trypan blue exclusion assay. Each time a Jurkat
cell treatment experiment was performed, four test compounds
were assayed together with a matched vehicle control (either
DMSO alone or DMSO with PMA/PHA stimulation at 24 h, as
appropriate).
Data
were
normalised
to
yield
percentage
changes from vehicle controls by dividing values measured
from (poly)phenol-treated cells by the value measured from the
matched vehicle control and multiplying by 100. To ascertain
whether mixtures of (poly)phenols may synergistically mod-
ulate Jurkat T-lymphocyte cytokine release, six mixtures were
analysed, each comprised of four (poly)phenols. The results
obtained following treatment of Jurkat T-lymphocytes with the
(poly)phenol mixtures were compared with the averaged
effects of those individual compounds. The total concentration
of mixed (poly)phenols and their metabolites was constant at
1 or 30 µmol/l to enable closer comparison with the individual
compound treatments.
Luminescent plate reader analysis of H2O2 generation
Using an opaque, black, ninety-six-well plate, 5 mM-DMSO
stock solutions of thirty-two different (poly)phenols (the same
thirty-one compounds tested for anti-inflammatory effects in the
Jurkat cell model, plus homovanillic acid) were diluted to a
final concentration of 30 µM in 200 µl of working solution
(1:1 solution of RPMI-1640 and Amplex Red (10-acetyl-3,7-
dihydroxyphenoxazine)-HRP reagent; Invitrogen). A DMSO-
only control was used as blank. Fluorescence was measured at
5-min intervals for 24 h with a Fluostar Omega plate reader
(BMG Labtech) using an excitation wavelength of 570 nm and
an emission wavelength of 585 nm. Kinetic reactions were
quantified from the gradient of the linear phase of each reaction
and converted into the rates of H2O2 generation (nmol/min)
by comparison with H2O2 standards.
Statistical analysis
Statistical analyses were performed using SPSS version 20 (IBM)
using raw data for cell number and H2O2 generation and data
normalised to cell number for cytokine measurements. Jurkat
CD4+ T-lymphocytes and primary PBMC-derived lymphocytes
treated with (poly)phenols were compared with matched vehicle
controls by one-way ANOVA with Dunnett’s post hoc test.
The predicted effects of mixtures of test compounds on cytokine
release by Jurkat CD4+ T-lymphocytes were compared with the
observed effects by one-way ANOVA with Tukey’s post hoc test.
All the statistical tests were performed at α = 0·05.

Phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate/phytohaemagglutinin
24-h treatment stimulates the release of pro-inflammatory
cytokines by Jurkat CD4+ T-lymphocytes
Jurkat CD4 + T-lymphocytes were treated with the protein
kinase C activator PMA and the plant-derived lymphocyte
mitogen PHA for 24 h to induce an inflammatory response and
cytokine release. The PMA/PHA-stimulated cells showed a sig-
nificant increase in the release of several pro-inflammatory
cytokines compared with vehicle control treatments (Table 1).
We chose to focus on IL-2, IL-8 and TNFα for further experiments
because of the relative magnitude of their induction by PMA/
PHA treatment and the well-defined roles of each of these pro-
teins as physiologically important pro-inflammatory cytokines.
Polyphenol catabolites modulate growth and cytokine
release by Jurkat CD4+ T-lymphocytes
After treatment with colonic catabolites of polyphenols (phe-
nolic acids) for 48 h, we measured the density of viable Jurkat
CD4+ T-lymphocytes in culture and the concentrations of the
pro-inflammatory cytokines IL-2, IL-8 and TNFα in the cell
culture media. Comparisons between (poly)phenol treatments
and vehicle controls revealed multiple effects on growth
and cytokine release (Fig. 2). The low molecular weight
(110–139g/mol)
catabolites
catechol,
phloroglucinol
and
4-hydroxybenzoic acid caused significant declines in cell number
(P<0·05; one-way ANOVA with Dunnett’s post hoc test) and sig-
nificantly induced release of IL-2, IL-8 and TNFα (P<0·05; one-
way ANOVA with Dunnett’s post hoc test), whereas tyrosol sig-
nificantly decreased IL-2 and IL-8 release from non-stimulated cells
at 1µmol/l (P<0·05; one-way ANOVA with Dunnett’s post hoc
test). Mid-molecular weight catabolites (168–195g/mol) reduced
pro-inflammatory cytokine release, with significant reduction in
IL-2 release from non-stimulated cells by 1µmol/l 4'-hydro-
xymandelic acid and vanillic acid (P<0·05; one-way ANOVA with
Dunnett’s post hoc test). Higher molecular weight test compounds
(196–252g/mol) showed mixed effects: feruloylglycine at 1µmol/l
significantly increased the release of IL-2 and TNFα, and iso-
feruloylglycine at 30µmol/l significantly reduced IL-8 release
from PMA/PHA-stimulated Jurkat CD4+ T-lymphocytes (P<0·05;
one-way ANOVA with Dunnett’s post hoc test).

3-ol (–)-epigallocatechin-3-O-gallate, and the anthocyanins
pelargonidin-3-O-glucoside
and

significantly
promoted
the
growth
of
Jurkat
CD4+
T-lymphocytes at 1 µmol/l (P < 0·05; one-way ANOVA with

test).
Chlorogenic
acid
and
3-O-
methylquercetin showed some anti-proliferative effects on
Jurkat CD4+ T-lymphocytes under all treatment conditions,
although statistical significance was only achieved for the
effects of 3-O-methylquercetin (P < 0·05; one-way ANOVA with
Dunnett’s post hoc test).
Mixtures of (poly)phenols interact to modulate cytokine
release
To assess potential interactions between test compounds in
modulating cytokine release, we prepared several mixtures of
(poly)phenols: mixture 1 representing low-molecular weight
colonic
catabolites
such
as
catechol,
phloroglucinol,
4-hydroxybenzoic
acid
and
protocatechuic
acid;
mixture
2
representing
mid-molecular
weight
colonic
catabolites
such as 4'-hydroxymandelic acid, 4'-hydroxyphenylacetic acid,
5-(3'-hydroxyphenyl) propionic acid and 3-(4'-hydroxyphenyl)
lactic acid; mixture 3 representing a mixture of dietary
polyphenols such as (–)-epigallocatechin-3-O-gallate, pelargo-
nidin-3-O-glucoside, cyanidin-3-O-glucoside and punicalagin;
mixture 4 representing polyphenols and high molecular weight
hydroxycinnamate metabolites, such as dihydroferulic acid,
feruloylglycine, quercetin and 3-O-methylquercetin; mixture 5
representing
a
mixture
of
hydroxycinnamate
derivatives
derived from chlorogenic acid after the consumption of coffee,
such
as
caffeic
acid,
ferulic
acid,
isoferulic
acid
and
isoferuloylglycine; and mixture 6 representing compounds
derived from apple cider, such as hippuric acid, tyrosol,
4'-hydroxyhippuric acid and chlorogenic acid. We measured
cytokine release from Jurkat CD4+ T-lymphocytes following
48 h of incubation with each mixture at a total concentration of
1 or 30 µmol/l, with or without stimulation with PMA/PHA
at 24 h. For comparison, the results previously obtained for
cytokine release following treatment with each individual
compound were averaged to generate a prediction of the effects
expected if there were no interactions between compounds
(i.e. a null hypothesis that there were no synergistic effects).
The results illustrated in Fig. 4 indicate that five of the six test
mixtures
significantly
reduced
pro-inflammatory
cytokine
release in comparison with results anticipated from simple
addition of the effects observed for individual compounds
(P < 0·05; one-way ANOVA with Dunnett’s post hoc test).

 Anti-inflammatory polyphenols modulate cytokine release
by peripheral blood mononuclear cell-derived human
lymphocytes
We investigated the polyphenols resveratrol, isorhamnetin
and curcumin, which had been identified to be the most
effective in reducing cytokine release from among the panel of
(poly)phenols that we screened in Jurkat CD4+ T-lymphocytes,
to
determine
whether
their
inhibitory
effects
on
pro-inflammatory
cytokine
release
were
sustained
in

(Fig.

(Poly)phenols produce H2O2 in cell culture media
Some (poly)phenols have been reported to generate H2O2 in
cell culture media(16,17). To quantify H2O2 production, we
conducted kinetic spectrophotometry assays using Amplex red
reagent, which is converted to fluorescent resorufin following
oxidation by H2O2. Production of H2O2 was detected for sixteen
of the thirty-two test compounds (Fig. 6(a)). H2O2 production
was detected from the hydroxybenzene derivatives catechol
and pyrogallol, the phenylacetic acid homoprotocatechuic acid,
the hydroxycinnamates caffeic acid and dihydrocaffeic acid,
and the ellagitannin punicalagin, whereas other test compounds
produced no detectable levels of H2O2. Comparisons were also
made to assess the effects of phenol red in the culture media,
which showed that rates of H2O2 production were 24 (SEM 2) %
lower in RPMI-1640 medium containing phenol red than
in RPMI-1640 medium without phenol red (data not shown
in detail).

(Poly)phenols modulate T-lymphocyte cytokine release

 Production of H2O2 by (poly)phenols does not strongly
correlate with cytokine release by CD4+ T-lymphocytes
Correlation assays were performed between the H2O2 pro-
duction by test compounds and their effects on Jurkat CD4+
T-lymphocyte growth and pro-inflammatory cytokine release
(Fig. 6(b)–(e)). These data indicate a potential correlation
between H2O2 production and IL-8 release in non-PMA/
PHA-stimulated cells (R2 0·3048).
Discussion
In these studies, we evaluated a panel of thirty-one (poly)
phenols for potential anti-inflammatory activity using a human
T-lymphocyte model of cytokine production. The compounds
tested were grouped by their molecular weight (Fig. 2 & 3), as
the lower molecular weight compounds tended to be the
colonic catabolites (phenolic acids). We observed substantial
inhibition of cytokine release primarily by the parent poly-
phenols, several of which modified cytokine release and
proliferation
by
T-lymphocytes
under
both baseline
and
activated (PMA/PHA stimulated) conditions. We also investi-
gated mixtures of (poly)phenols, and our data show that five
of
the
six
mixtures
of
test
compounds
had
greater
anti-inflammatory effects than that predicted under our null
hypothesis based on the effects of the individual compounds.
We further explored the effects of three of the dietary
polyphenols showing anti-inflammatory effects in Jurkat cells in
healthy human lymphocytes and found that isorhamnetin
reduced pro-inflammatory cytokine release from LPS-stimulated
lymphocytes at 1 µM. (Poly)phenols have been proposed to
reduce the risk of developing chronic diseases during ageing by
modulating inflammatory responses and the production of
pro-inflammatory cytokines in multiple tissues(25).
A number of previous studies have examined the potential
effects of various polyphenols on cytokine release(28–31), and a
number of dietary components including curcumin, resveratrol,
genistein and epigallocatechin have been shown to modulate
the
release
of
pro-inflammatory
cytokines
from
cells
in
culture(30). Various mechanisms of action have been proposed
including inhibition of NF-κB, inhibition of prostanoids, inhibi-
tion of AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK) and mitogen-
activated protein kinase (MAPK) pathways and antioxidant
effects(31). There has been a great deal of interest in the bioa-
vailability of dietary polyphenols, as the non-metabolised
compounds are only found in the circulation at nM to low µM
concentrations. Compounds such as flavonoids are absorbed in
the small intestine and appear in the circulation as glucur-
onoids, sulphates and methylated metabolites, but these are
rapidly removed from the bloodstream(32); however, substantial
amounts of the unconjugated compounds pass into the colon
where they are converted to lower molecular weight catabolites
such as phenolic acids by colonic microflora(33). Relatively little
is known about the potential anti-inflammatory effects of these
lower molecular weight phenolic acids following absorption,
and this was a major aim of the present study.
Polyphenols were routinely examined at final concentrations
of either 1 or 30 µM, reflecting concentrations that may
potentially be achieved in the circulation through ingestion of
foodstuffs or supplements, respectively. Our data showed that
several (poly)phenol treatments modulated the release of
pro-inflammatory cytokines (IL-2, IL-8 and TNFα) from Jurkat
human CD4+ T-lymphocytes. The Jurkat cell line was originally
derived from an adolescent male with acute lymphoblastic
leukaemia and they are widely used as a model for pro-
inflammatory cytokine release(34). Jurkat CD4+ T-lymphocytes
were incubated with test compounds at 1 and 30 µM either non-
stimulated or stimulated with PMA/PHA. We were interested to
investigate both lower and higher dose ranges based on
previous reports of differential effects between low- and
high-dose
(poly)phenols
in
vivo(35).
The
most
potent
anti-inflammatory compounds from our experiments in Jurkat
CD4+ T-lymphocytes were isorhamnetin (a flavonol that occurs
as a glycoside in apples, onions and green tea), curcumin
(from the Indian spice turmeric) and resveratrol (which is
present in the skin of red, purple and black grapes and in
especially high concentrations in Itadori tea).
The low molecular weight phenolic acids (Fig. 2) were gen-
erally less effective at reducing cytokine release than the uncon-
jugated polyphenols, although some reductions in Il-2 release
were seen with vanillic acid, tyrosol and 4-hydroxymandelic acid.
Vanillic acid is a catabolite of multiple dietary polyphenols,
including those found in wheat and blackcurrant juice(36), and is
also present at high concentrations in açai berries(37,38). Vanillic
acid significantly reduced IL-2 release from non-stimulated Jurkat
CD4+ T-lymphocytes at 1µmol/l, which is within the range of
concentrations previously reported in human plasma(36), sug-
gesting that vanillic acid may be a physiologically relevant anti-
inflammatory metabolite of dietary polyphenols.
Following ingestion of (poly)phenol-rich foodstuffs, a range
of (poly)phenols, conjugates and catabolites are absorbed into
the circulation. It is not understood whether the exposure of
CD4+ T-lymphocytes to mixtures of these compounds may elicit
different responses in comparison with the same compounds
applied individually. To begin to address this issue, we treated

(Poly)phenols modulate T-lymphocyte cytokine release
1707
Downloaded from https://www.cambridge.org/core. IP address: 77.173.35.219, on 02 Jun 2019 at 17:15:47, subject to the Cambridge Core terms of use, available at https://www.cambridge.org/core/terms. https://doi.org/10.1017/S0007114516000805
 the data obtained generally support this. Demonstration of true
synergy between bioactive materials such as drugs requires a
rigorous statistical approach(39), which we do not have the
dose–response data to undertake for the large group of
polyphenols that were studied; however, the data presented
appear to indicate the possibility of such synergistic effects and
warrant further investigation.
It has been reported that (poly)phenols produce H2O2 in cell
culture media due to autoxidation catalysed by transition metals
such as Fe and Cu and that this may influence the responses of
cells in culture(17,40). We measured the production of H2O2 by
different (poly)phenols and related compounds in RPMI-1640
medium containing 10 % FBS using the Amplex red-HRP
technique. This assay is specific for H2O2 in simple solutions
and has been widely used to examine H2O2 release by cells and
sub-cellular fractions of cells(41). H2O2 generation was found to
vary between compounds, with certain phenolic catabolites
producing relatively large amounts of H2O2 and others produ-
cing no detectable H2O2. Analysis of H2O2 generation by (poly)
phenols in comparison with their chemical structures indicated
that, in accordance with theoretical predictions(40), molecules
with orthohydroxy groups on adjacent carbons of a benzene
ring tended to generate H2O2. However, protocatechuic acid
and 3-O-methylquercetin, which have benzene ring orthohy-
droxy groups, generated negligible H2O2, and moderate H2O2
generation was detected from isorhamnetin and resveratrol,
which do not have orthohydroxy groups, implying that other
aspects
of
the
chemical
structure
also
influence
H2O2
generation. The average rate of H2O2 generation for these
compounds in RPMI-1640 medium was 5·6 nmol H2O2/µmol
(poly)phenol
per
min.
We
investigated
whether
H2O2
generation by each test compound correlated with their effects
on
the
release
of
IL-2,
IL-8
or
TNFα
by
Jurkat
CD4+
T-lymphocytes or the growth of Jurkat cultures. A correlation
was identified between H2O2 production and IL-8 release by
CD4+ T-lymphocytes that were not stimulated with PMA/PHA.
Interestingly,
previous
studies
have
indicated
that
IL-8
production is subject to modulation by redox signalling(34)
and can be induced by extracellular H2O2 in epithelial cell lines
via activation of the redox-sensitive transcription factors acti-
vator protein-1 (AP-1) and NF-кB(42,43). Our results suggest that
with PMA/PHA stimulation the influence of H2O2 on IL-8
release appears to become negligible. IL-2 and TNFα release
and cell proliferation showed no clear relationship with H2O2
generation in non-stimulated or PMA/PHA-stimulated Jurkat
CD4+ T-lymphocytes. Halliwell et al.(44,45) have also pointed
out that the absence of any detection of H2O2 generation
by a compound in cell culture cannot be equated to the
stability
of
the
compound
as
some
polyphenols
were
observed to rapidly degrade and autoxidise in the absence
of detectable H2O2 generation. Thus, our studies indicate a
lack of correlation between in vitro H2O2 generation and
effects of the compound on cytokine release, but do not
exclude other cell culture artifacts that may have influenced the
data obtained.
We chose to undertake a limited proof-of-principle study
to
investigate
the
potential
anti-inflammatory
effects
of
isorhamnetin, curcumin and resveratrol in primary PBMC-
derived human lymphocytes. Cells were pre-treated with 1 or
30 µM polyphenol for 5 h, followed by stimulation of cytokine
release using LPS stimulation and incubation for a total period
of 24 h. We observed a significant reduction in IP-10 release
following treatment with 1 µM isorhamnetin, and there was also
a trend (P = 0·07) towards reduced TNFα release with the same
treatment. These studies were undertaken using lymphocytes
from a single donor and clearly require confirmation using cells
from a larger group of donors, but this approach was
considered out with the remit of the present study due to the
large variability in cytokine release from lymphocytes obtained
from different donors.
In conclusion, we have shown that (poly)phenols modulate
the
release of
cytokines
by
Jurkat CD4+
T-lymphocytes
under resting and chemically activated conditions. Some
compounds were found to have anti-inflammatory effects,
while others were pro-inflammatory, and the effects varied with
dose, suggesting that some dietary (poly)phenols may be
beneficial for the prevention or management of chronic
inflammatory
conditions.
We
identified
isorhamnetin,
curcumin, resveratrol and vanillic acid as negative regulators
of
pro-inflammatory
cytokine
release
in
Jurkat
CD4+
T-lymphocytes,
and
also
showed
that
1 µM
isorhamnetin
reduced pro-inflammatory cytokine release by primary human
lymphocytes. Use of mixtures of (poly)phenols also suggested
that
they
may
act
synergistically
to
modulate
cytokine
release by Jurkat CD4+ T-lymphocytes. Taking into account
the main dietary sources of the compounds, our data support a
potential anti-inflammatory role for (poly)phenols derived from
red, purple and black grapes, turmeric, whole wheat, black-
currants, apples and onions, and suggest that individuals at risk
of chronic inflammation, such as older people, may benefit
from supplementing their diets with isorhamnetin, resveratrol,
curcumin and vanillic acid or with food sources that yield these
bioactive molecules.
