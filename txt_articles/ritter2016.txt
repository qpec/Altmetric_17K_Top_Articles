Zika Virus
Pathology From the Pandemic
Jana M. Ritter, DVM; Roosecelis B. Martines, MD, PhD; Sherif R. Zaki, MD, PhD
� Context.—As the number of Zika virus (ZIKV) infections
continues to grow, so, too, does the spectrum of
recognized clinical disease, in both adult and congenital
infections. Defining the tissue pathology associated with
the various disease manifestations provides insight into
pathogenesis and diagnosis, and potentially future preven-
tion and treatment, of ZIKV infections.
Objective.—To summarize the syndromes and pathology
associated with ZIKV infection, the implications of
pathologic findings in pathogenesis of ZIKV disease, and
the use of pathology specimens for diagnosis of ZIKV
infection.
Data Sources.—The major sources of information for
this review were published articles obtained from PubMed
and pathologic findings from cases submitted to the
Infectious Diseases Pathology Branch at the Centers for
Disease Control and Prevention.
Conclusions.—Pathologic findings associated with ZIKV
infection are characteristic but not specific. In congenital
Zika syndrome, tissue pathology is due to direct viral
infection of neural structures, whereas in Guillain-Barr´
e
syndrome, pathology is likely due to a postviral, aberrant
host-directed immune response. Both fetal and placental
pathology specimens are useful for ZIKV diagnosis by
molecular and immunohistochemical assays; however, the
implications of ZIKV detection in placentas from second-
and third-trimester normal live births are unclear, as the
potential postnatal effects of late gestational exposure
remain to be seen.

A
s the first infectious agent to be associated with an
epidemic of birth defects in more than 50 years,1 Zika
virus (ZIKV) has raised concern among parents and within
communities worldwide.2 After its identification in the mid-
20th century, it spread at first slowly and largely unnoticed
through Africa and Asia, but is now rapidly spreading across
the Americas, with active mosquito-borne transmission
reported in more than 50 countries and territories as of
August 1, 2016, and with travel-associated cases identified
in other regions (Figure 1).3–10 As such, the World Health
Organization11 has declared the pandemic a Public Health
Emergency of International Concern, and pregnant women
have been advised to avoid travel to affected regions.12
Zika virus is an RNA virus of the family Flaviviridae, and is
closely related to other members of this family, including
dengue, yellow fever, West Nile, and Japanese encephalitis
viruses.13 It was first isolated from a sentinel rhesus
macaque from the Zika forest of Uganda in 1947, and was
largely unknown until its spread to Micronesia in 2007,
when an outbreak of acute, self-limiting disease including
primarily rash, fever, arthralgia, and conjunctivitis affected
nearly 200 people.14 In 2013–2014, it gained more attention
during an outbreak in French Polynesia affecting an
estimate of approximately 28 000 people with a similar
acute and self-limiting disease, but with a small minority of
those also exhibiting more severe, neurologic signs.15–18 It
wasn’t until 2015, however, with its spread through the
Pacific Islands to the Americas and its association with a
large outbreak of severe congenital anomalies, particularly
microcephaly, that Zika became a household name. As the
geographic reach of the virus expands, so too does our
understanding
of
the
variety
and
severity
of
clinical
manifestations.
Understanding the disease biology of ZIKV is crucial for
effective intervention.19 To this end, correlating clinical
manifestations with underlying tissue pathology can provide
critical insights into disease pathogenesis.20,21 Despite the
massive amount of rapidly accruing literature about ZIKV,
descriptions of pathology related to ZIKV infections have
been limited.22,23 This is due largely to the fact that most
infections are asymptomatic, and of the remainder, most
have mild and self-limiting disease that does not warrant
tissue sampling for histopathologic evaluation.14 Even for
the small proportion of infections with severe clinical
manifestations, pathologic changes in tissues may be mild
or
nonspecific,
and
not
readily
attributable
to
ZIKV
infection.14–26 Here, we summarize the pathology for the
major clinical syndromes heretofore associated with ZIKV
infection, and discuss their implications for disease patho-
genesis. Described pathologic findings include those from
the current literature and from evaluation of cases submitted

ZIKA SYNDROMES AND PATHOLOGY
Zika Fever
Although limited, available data suggest that approxi-
mately 80% of ZIKV infections are asymptomatic.14 When
symptoms occur, they typically comprise a mild, self-limited
denguelike syndrome of less than 2 weeks’ duration.26 Low-
grade fever, rash, arthralgias, and bilateral nonpurulent
conjunctivitis occur most commonly, with retro-orbital pain,
myalgias, lymphadenopathy, sore throat, aphthous ulcers,
and genitourinary and gastrointestinal symptoms less
commonly reported (Figures 2 and 3).14,27–32 The rash is
usually pruritic, erythematous, and maculopapular, and
spreads in a descending fashion from face to extremities
(Figure 3, A through C).33,34 Histologically, the skin shows
nonspecific changes of mild to moderate perivascular
lymphocytic dermal inflammation (Figure 3, D).35 Arthral-
gias frequently involve the joints of the hands and feet, and
may be accompanied by periarticular edema. Leukopenia,
thrombocytopenia, and elevated liver enzymes may be
present.36–38 Distinguishing Zika fever from dengue and
chikungunya infections, which are common in these same
geographic regions, is not possible clinically; however, ZIKV
may be more commonly associated with peripheral edema
and conjunctivitis, and less commonly with leukopenia and
thrombocytopenia, than are these other viruses.39 Rarely,
severe and even fatal ZIKV disease may occur, particularly in
the settings of severe thrombocytopenia or underlying
disease.40,41
Noncongenital Neurologic Syndromes
Neurologic sequelae to Zika fever have been recognized in
a small proportion of cases. The ZIKV outbreak in French
Polynesia in 2013–2014 included more than 8000 suspected
infections, with 74 having neurologic symptoms and more
than half of those being diagnosed with Guillain-Barr´
e
syndrome (GBS).17 Guillain-Barr´
e syndrome is a post-
infectious autoimmune polyradiculoneuropathy that occurs
following an antecedent antigenic stimulus, most commonly
a viral or bacterial infection. It is characterized by initial
weakness and motor dysfunction with decreased or absent
deep tendon reflexes, typically progressing from involve-
ment of the legs to the upper extremities and trunk muscles
and, in some cases, the cranial nerves.17,19,42 In French
Polynesia, GBS symptoms including generalized muscle
weakness, inability to walk, and facial palsy occurred in
patients a median of 6 days after symptoms of Zika fever.
Electrophysiologic studies in most patients showed acute
motor axonal neuropathy, with distal nerve segment
conduction disturbances that improved at 4-month follow-
up. A case-control study identified neutralizing antibodies
against ZIKV in 100% of GBS patients compared with only

Zika virus (ZIKV) distribution through August 2016. Zika virus was first isolated in Uganda in 1947 and then spread slowly through Africa
and Asia. Since 2007, ZIKV outbreaks have been recognized in Southeast Asia and Oceania. The current outbreak associated with microcephaly and
other congenital abnormalities was recognized in Brazil in 2015 and is currently spreading through South and Central America, with a small cluster of
cases identified in Florida. Courtesy of Elizabeth Ervin, MPH, Viral Special Pathogens Branch, Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, Atlanta,

 56% of controls, providing strong evidence of an association
between GBS and recent ZIKV infection.17,43
Concomitantly with the spread of ZIKV to the Americas,
there has been an increase in observed GBS cases in Brazil,
Colombia, El Salvador, Venezuela, Martinique, and Sur-
iname.36,42–46 Although a causal association between ZIKV
infection and GBS has not been clearly established,
preliminary findings in the municipality of Salvador, Brazil,
between May and July 2015 indicate a more than 4-fold
increase over the expected incidence of GBS and a strong
correlation with symptoms of Zika fever (more than 90% of
patients) prior to GBS onset. Of 50 patients diagnosed with
ZIKV-related GBS, all had flaccid weakness in the lower
extremities, and more than half also had upper extremity or
cranial nerve involvement. Three fatalities occurred; no
autopsies were performed (James Sejvar, MD, written
communication, July 6, 2016). Three ZIKV-associated GBS
deaths have also been reported in Colombia.47 To our
knowledge, there are no published reports to date on the
histopathology of ZIKV-associated GBS; however, histo-
pathologic evaluation in one case showed peripheral nerve
demyelination and mononuclear inflammation with axonal
degeneration (Figure 3, E through G). These findings are
consistent with typical GBS histopathology and are thought
to be due to a cross-reactive immune response to foreign
(infectious agent) and host neural antigens, rather than a
consequence of direct neural infection.48,49 Further histo-
pathologic characterization and attempted ZIKV detection
in neural tissues from ZIKV-associated GBS patients would
provide additional insight into whether this same mecha-
nism appears to be consistently involved in these cases, or if
direct ZIKV infection of the peripheral nervous system may
also play a role.
Neurologic sequelae other than GBS reportedly associated
with ZIKV infection are rare and include acute myelitis and
meningoencephalitis. Myelitis with cervical spinal cord
edema and thoracic cord lesion were diagnosed by imaging
studies in a 15-year-old girl with high ZIKV RNA load
detected by reverse transcription–polymerase chain reaction
(RT-PCR) in serum, urine, and cerebrospinal fluid.50
Meningoencephalitis was diagnosed by magnetic resonance
imaging in an 81-year-old man with cerebrospinal fluid
pleocytosis and RT-PCR and culture positive for ZIKV.51
Testing for other infectious agents was negative for both
patients. Both recovered with treatment; the man’s treat-
ment regimen was not specified, but the girl’s myelitis
responded to corticosteroids, suggesting that, as with GBS,
the lesion may have been due largely to an aberrant
immune response rather than direct viral infection of the
spinal cord.
Congenital Zika Syndrome
Fetal Manifestations.—The rise in incidence of micro-
cephaly months after the rise in ZIKV infections in Brazil
Figure 2.
Outcomes of Zika virus (ZIKV) infection. Zika virus infection through mosquito bite, sexual contact, blood transfusion, or potentially other
transmission routes results in asymptomatic infection in adults approximately 80% of the time. When present, the most common symptoms of Zika
fever are rash, fever, conjunctivitis, and arthralgias. Rarely, Guillain-Barr ´
e syndrome (GBS) may follow the febrile illness. Infection during the first
trimester of pregnancy may cause congenital Zika syndrome (CZS), resulting in miscarriage or congenital fetal abnormalities. Infection after the first
trimester appears to rarely result in congenital abnormalities at birth. The potential for late-onset neurologic or other effects and the possibility of
potentiating genetic or environmental factors require further investigation. Corresponding with the association of CZS predominantly with first-
trimester infections, ZIKV has been detected in the placenta by immunohistochemistry (IHC) only in first-trimester placentas; however, viral RNA has
been detected by reverse transcription–polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) in second- and third-trimester placentas. Courtesy of Meredith Boyter

 alerted health officials to the potential association of ZIKV
with birth defects.19 There are now estimates of up to 1.3
million ZIKV infections in Brazil, associated with 1434 cases
of confirmed microcephaly or other congenital abnormali-
ties, including 208 cases with laboratory evidence of ZIKV
infection.45,52 Furthermore, retrospective analysis of the
French Polynesia outbreak, including laboratory testing of
amniotic fluid from pregnancies with abnormal cerebral
ultrasounds, also showed a strong link between fetal
neurologic abnormalities and ZIKV infection.53–55 Epidemi-
ologic, clinical, and laboratory evidence for ZIKV causality
has been established, and a broader spectrum of abnormal-
ities has emerged, composing congenital Zika syndrome
(CZS).1,56 According to the World Health Organization, in
addition to microcephaly, CZS may include ‘‘craniofacial
disproportion, spasticity, seizures, irritability and brainstem
dysfunction including feeding difficulties, ocular abnormal-
ities, and findings on neuroimaging such as calcifications,
cortical disorders, and ventriculomegaly. . . . Genitourinary,
cardiac, and digestive systems can also be affected.’’ 56 The
majority of infants with CZS are born to mothers with
symptomatic Zika fever in the first trimester24,45; in one
study, up to 70% of mothers of microcephalic infants had
rash in the first trimester.57
Microcephaly is defined as occipitofrontal head circum-
ference 2 or more SD below the mean for sex and
gestational age at birth, and is categorized as severe if head
circumference is 3 or more SD below the mean (Figure 4, A
and B).26,58 It may be detected by prenatal ultrasound;
however, both false-negative and false-positive diagnoses
may occur, particularly early in pregnancy.19,59 Ultrasound
and/or autopsy may reveal widespread brain calcifications
(periventricular, cerebral parenchyma, thalami, and basal
ganglia), cortical thinning with ventricular dilation, simpli-
fied gyral patterns (eg, lissencephaly, pachygyria, agyria),
and cerebellar hypoplasia. Thinning of the pons and
brainstem, dysgenesis or agenesis of corpus callosum, and
holoprosencephaly are also reported. The frontal and
parietal lobes and lateral ventricles are predominantly
affected, and calcifications are present in a bandlike
periventricular or corticomedullary pattern (Figure 4, C).
Extracranial abnormalities may also be seen (Figure 4, D).
Histopathology of the brain consistently shows cortical
thinning with neuronal apoptosis/necrosis and punctate to
coarse, and sometimes neuron-shaped, calcifications in
cortex and subcortical white matter (Figure 5, A through
D). Periventricular and white matter rarefaction with
macrophagic infiltrates, perivascular lymphocytic infiltrates,
microglial proliferation and activation, and glial nodules are
variably reported (Figure 5, E). Viral inclusions have not
been documented.26,58,60–64 Spinal cord pathology is de-
scribed for one case and includes Wallerian degeneration of

 the descending motor tracts, with sparing of dorsal tracts.62
Immunohistochemistry for ZIKV shows labeling of viral
antigen in glial cells, endothelial cells, and degenerating
cortical neurons and associated with calcifications (Figure 5,
F and G).24,64 Transmission electron microscopy showed
spherical 40-nm enveloped viral particles and viral factories
within neurons in the brain of an aborted 22-week-
gestation fetus with CZS, indicating active viral replication
in these cells (Martines, 2016, manuscript in preparation).
Zika virus–associated microcephaly and other brain
abnormalities are usually part of generalized intrauterine
growth restriction, and are commonly accompanied by
congenital contractures (arthrogryposis) due to lack of fetal
movement secondary to neurologic abnormalities (Figure 4,
D).22,26,34,60,64,65 Oligohydramnios or anhydramnios, hydrops
fetalis, pulmonary hypoplasia, cryptorchidism, and fetal
death are also reported.34,64,66 In surviving microcephalic
infants, ocular abnormalities are also common, with
alterations in the neural components of the eye occurring
in up to 55% of infants in some reports.67,68 Macular retinal
and optic nerve changes are most consistently reported on
funduscopic examination, with macular pigment mottling,
foveal reflex loss, chorioretinal atrophy, and optic nerve
hypoplasia with optic disc cupping.67–70 Lens subluxation,
bilateral iris coloboma, vascular abnormalities, cataract,
intraocular calcifications, and microphthalmia are also
reported.67,71 Histopathologic correlates of ocular changes
are not thoroughly described in the literature to date, but
demonstration of ZIKV antigen in the retina by immuno-
histochemistry indicates direct infection of ocular structures
(Figure 5, H).
Placental Manifestations.—Placental pathologic lesions
in CZS are frequently absent, and documented to date
predominantly for maternal infection in the first trimes-
ter.24,57,64 When present, changes are mild and nonspecific
and comprise chronic placentitis, with chronic villitis or
increased Hofbauer cells and patchy perivillous fibrin and
mononuclear cells. Villous immaturity, edema, hypervascu-
larity, stromal fibrosis and calcification, focal syncytiotro-
phoblast necrosis, and mild lymphocytic deciduitis may also
be present (Figure 6, A through C).24,64 Immunohistochem-

 endothelium, and maternal leukocytes has been shown only
in first-trimester placentas, despite viral RNA being
detectable in placental tissue even from full-term pregnan-
cies (Figures 2 and 6, D).24,64,72 Second- or third-trimester
placentas negative by IHC and positive by RT-PCR for ZIKV
RNA may have calcifications and perivillous fibrin deposi-
tion, but these features are indistinguishable from stillbirths
due to other causes and otherwise normal late-term
placentas.26,73
PATHOGENESIS
Zika virus likely exists in sylvatic and urban cycles, with
monkey and human hosts, respectively, and the possibility
of other, as yet unidentified, animal reservoirs. Transmission
occurs
primarily
through
the
bite
of
infected
Aedes
mosquitoes (Aedes aegypti and Aedes albopictus), though it
has also been documented through sexual contact and
suspected through blood transfusion and animal bite (Figure
2).19,30,74–76 Zika virus RNA has been detected in semen,
saliva, urine, breast milk, and donated whole blood.16,31,77,78
Of utmost concern given the current outbreak are maternal
transmission routes, for which there is evidence of both
transplacental
and
perinatal
transmission,
with
ZIKV
detection in amniotic fluid and placental and fetal tissues,
and potential for postnatal transmission through breast
milk.26,54,62–66,72,79,80
Pathology and other studies have shown that ZIKV’s
congenital neurologic effects are clearly correlated with
direct fetal infection and neurotropism of the virus, as
opposed to placental insufficiency or fetotoxic placental
immune response resulting from placental infection.64,81 The
primary potential routes of fetal infections in general include
maternal viremia with transfer from maternal blood across
the syncytiotrophoblast to fetal vessels in the placenta or
direct transfer at the implantation site via extravillous
trophoblasts, and ascending infection from the genitouri-
nary tract with transfer across the fetal membranes.82
Immunohistochemical
detection
of
ZIKV
in
maternal
leukocytes, Hofbauer cells, and fetal endothelial cells, along
with demonstration of ZIKV replication in primary human
placental macrophages in vitro, suggests transfer across the
syncytiotrophoblast as the major route of fetal ZIKV
infection.24,64,83
Once
ZIKV
gains
access
to
the
fetal
circulation, widespread dissemination is presumed, with
subsequent viral replication and persistence in permissive
tissues. In a review of 10 cases with congenital ZIKV
infection, ZIKV was detected by IHC in a variety of
embryonic tissues (brain, kidney, lung, liver, heart, skin) in
pathology specimens from first-trimester embryos (n ¼ 3),
but was localized by IHC to only central nervous system
(CNS) tissues in fetuses after the first trimester (n ¼ 7)
(Martines, 2016, manuscript in preparation). Though limit-
ed, these findings support initial ZIKV dissemination in the
fetus, with specific tropism for, and persistent replication in,
neural tissues.
In vitro and animal studies further demonstrate ZIKV
neurotropism and CNS damage. ZIKV infects and replicates
in human neural progenitor cells in vitro and in human stem
cell
culture
systems
that
model
3-dimensional
brain
structure (neurospheres and cerebral organoids).84–86 Fur-
thermore, infection results in morphologic and architectural
alterations to these primitive brainlike structures that are
reminiscent of those seen in the brains of ZIKV congenitally
infected microcephalic infants, including cell death and
thinning of the ventricular zone–like layer, with dilation of
ventricular structures.85,86 Mouse models show CNS tropism
and damage preferentially in young or immunodeficient
animals.87–90 Infection of immunodeficient pregnant dams
results in viral detection in placenta and fetal brain,
sometimes with reduced brain size and cortical thinning,
similar to CZS.91–94 Studies in infected pregnant monkeys
are ongoing, and show preliminary ultrasonographic evi-
dence of decreased fetal head circumference associated with
maternal ZIKV infection.91
The timing of maternal infection (first trimester) associ-
ated with CZS and the preferential susceptibility of neural
progenitor cells in vitro and the CNS of young and fetal
animals in vivo suggest that the overall mechanism of neural
damage relates to arrest of brain growth, rather than
damage and collapse of preformed neural structures.95 More
mature neurons in vitro, older experimental animals, later-
gestational-age human fetuses, and adults appear more
resistant to neural infection, suggesting that neural matu-
ration confers resistance to ZIKV.84,86–88 Noncongenital
neurologic syndromes may therefore be due to overactive
or aberrant host-directed immune responses rather than
direct viral infection of neural cells. That this is the classically
understood mechanism behind GBS, the most common
noncongenital neurologic ZIKV-associated syndrome, sup-
ports this hypothesis. Further, ZIKV and human peptide
commonalities have been found, indicating potential targets
for such an immune response.96
ZIKV is unique among flaviviruses, and among arbovi-
ruses in general, in its strong predilection for maternofetal
transmission and adverse fetal outcomes. Microcephaly
specifically has not been reported for other flaviviral
infections during pregnancy.11 Dengue virus infection is
associated with much less severe adverse outcomes (pre-
term birth and low birth weight), if any at all, and these
outcomes may most often be due to placental infection and
insufficiency rather than vertical transfer, though congenital
infection with infant death has been documented.80,97
Destructive brain lesions in one case of congenital West
Nile virus infection were reported.98 Severe outcomes,
including fetal encephalopathy and miscarriage, are occa-
sionally reported with congenital chikungunya virus infec-
tion.99,100 In dengue, poor outcomes have been linked to
prior infection with another dengue virus serotype, poten-
tially through antibody-dependent enhancement of infec-
tion.101,102 It remains to be determined whether prior or
concurrent dengue virus infection, which is likely in ZIKV-
affected areas, might also predispose to GBS or congenital
infection in patients with ZIKV infection.11,43,101,102
DIAGNOSIS
Characterizing
and
monitoring
the
ZIKV
pandemic
requires the ability to recognize ZIKV-associated clinical
syndromes and accurately attribute them to ZIKV infection,
which can be difficult. Zika fever shares an overlapping
clinical syndrome with other cocirculating viruses, particu-
larly dengue and chikungunya viruses, and the features of
CZS—namely microcephaly—can also be associated with
many other infectious (eg, TORCH agents: Toxoplasma,
syphilis, varicella-zoster, rubella, cytomegalovirus [CMV],
and herpes simplex viruses) and noninfectious (eg, genetic,
metabolic, environmental, and toxic) causes.58 Coinfections
are
also
possible.103–105
The
neuropathology
of
early
congenital infection is generally similar (brain growth arrest

Zika Virus: Pathology From the Pandemic—Ritter et al
 with the constellation of abnormalities as described for
CZS), regardless of the infection(s) responsible; however,
subtle differences
may help to guide
the differential
diagnosis.106 In addition to ZIKV, microcephaly is particu-
larly common with congenital CMV, Toxoplasma, rubella,
and herpes simplex virus infections; calcifications are most
common with CMV and Toxoplasma, and Toxoplasma
frequently
has
a
nodular
distribution
of
lesions
and
hydrocephaly.31,61,75 Ocular abnormalities are also common
in CMV and Toxoplasma.26,70 Although ZIKV appears to have
a more specific tropism for, and marked potential for
destruction of, the CNS, TORCH infections may more
frequently be associated with extraneural abnormalities.66,71
Rubella, CMV, and herpes simplex virus infections may
result in auditory deficits, and rubella commonly has cardiac
anomalies.26,57,107 The full spectrum of CZS has not yet been
described, and additional overlapping, or potentially distin-
guishing, features may emerge. Histopathologic findings in
CNS and placenta can be nonspecific for all congenital
infections, and as reported in some ZIKV cases thus far,
congenital rubella infections may also have a notable lack of
inflammation in tissues.64,108
Because clinical and pathologic features of ZIKV are
nonspecific, laboratory confirmation of ZIKV and exclusion
of other viruses are equally imperative; however, this can
also be challenging because of cross-reactivity of the more
readily available immunoglobulin M enzyme-linked im-
munosorbent assays with other flaviviruses. Additional
confirmatory testing (plaque reduction neutralization test)
is needed to distinguish ZIKV-specific antibodies, but this
testing can only be performed in select reference labora-
tories, and interpretation can also be challenging in
patients with prior flaviviral exposure.8,109 Zika virus can
be
distinguished
by
viral
isolation
or
RT-PCR
with
sequencing performed on serum, plasma, whole blood,
amniotic fluid, urine, saliva, semen, and tissues. Although
viremia typically lasts for less than 1 week, it has been
documented at up to 10 weeks after symptom onset in
pregnant women.8,27,65,110 Furthermore, RT-PCR positivity
has been documented up to 2 months after symptom onset
in whole blood, up to 26 days in urine, and up to 18 weeks
in amniotic fluid.65,78,111 For pathology specimens specifi-
cally, RT-PCR can be performed on fresh or formalin-fixed,
paraffin-embedded fetal and placental tissues, and viral
antigen can be demonstrated by IHC in formalin-fixed,
paraffin-embedded tissues.64,72,112
Definitively confirming or excluding ZIKV infection in
surviving neonatal infants can be challenging because
testing at the time of delivery may be beyond the window
of reliable detection by both serology and RT-PCR assays,
especially for first-trimester maternal infections. Testing of
full-term placental tissues from surviving infants by RT-PCR
can be used to support maternal and fetal serology results.
However, testing of placental tissue cannot definitively
confirm or exclude infant infection specifically, because
positive results could be due to persistent viral RNA in
maternal and/or fetal portions of the sample, and negative
results could be due to testing outside the window of
detection
or
nonrepresentative
sampling.
Though
not
confirmatory for congenital ZIKV infection in asymptomatic
neonates at the time of birth, positive RT-PCR results in
placental tissues might prove to be prognostically useful if a
correlation with late-onset neurologic disease is identified in
the future.
FUTURE CHALLENGES
The ultimate scale and impact of the ZIKV pandemic
remain to be seen.113 It is likely that microcephaly and other
severe abnormalities recognized at birth represent only the
severe end of a spectrum of neurologic, and potentially also
extraneural, manifestations of congenital ZIKV infection.11,71
Similarly to other maternal infections (eg, TORCH agents)
and
fetotoxic
insults,
exposure
in
the
latter
half
of
pregnancy, after cortical organization is largely completed,
may result in less overt neurologic or other impairments that
may be detected only later in life.95 Long-term follow-up of
infants with maternal ZIKV infection, regardless of whether
or not they show signs of CZS at birth, is therefore crucial to
fully characterizing this syndrome (Figure 2). Further
investigations to elucidate the specific mechanisms of
placental tropism and neurotropism, and to evaluate for
potential viral factors or cofactors that may potentiate the
effects of congenital ZIKV infection, are also critical to fully
understanding CZS.11,19 The continued development and
refinement of animal models will undoubtedly be crucial in
these endeavors and in therapeutic development efforts.
Alongside research efforts, controlling the virus and
preventing its further geographic spread is of immediate
importance. Besides individual avoidance of mosquitos and
non–vector-borne exposure, improvements in systematic
mosquito population control and development of a vaccine
for ZIKV may hold the most promise for extinguishing the
pandemic. We must simultaneously begin the tasks of
addressing the short-term and long-term care needs of
children with CZS and its lifelong impairments and the
accompanying social and economic impacts of this disease.
