Purpose: Unaccompanied youth homelessness is a serious concern. Response, however, has been
constrained by the absence of credible data on the size and characteristics of the population and
reliable means to track youth homelessness over time. We sought to address these gaps.
Methods: Using a nationally representative phone-based survey (N = 26,161), we solicited house-
hold and individual reports on different types of youth homelessness. We collected household reports
on adolescents aged 13–17 and young adults aged 18–25, as well as self-reports from young adults
aged 18–25. Follow-up interviews with a subsample (n = 150) provided additional information on
youth experiences and enabled adjustment for inclusion errors.
Results: Over a 12-month period, approximately 3.0% of households with 13- to 17-year-olds re-
ported explicit youth homelessness (including running away or being asked to leave) and 1.3%
reported experiences that solely involved couch surfing, resulting in an overall 4.3% household prev-
alence of any homelessness, broadly defined. For 18- to 25-year-olds, household prevalence estimates
were 5.9% for explicitly reported homelessness, 6.6% for couch surfing only, and 12.5% overall. The
12-month population prevalence estimates, available only for 18- to 25-year-olds, were 5.2%, 4.5%,
and 9.7%, respectively. Incidence rates were about half as high as prevalence rates. Prevalence rates
were similar across rural and nonrural counties. Higher risk of homelessness was observed among
young parents; black, Hispanic, and lesbian, gay, bisexual, or transgender (LGBT) youth; and those
who did not complete high school.
Conclusions: The prevalence and incidence of youth homelessness reveal a significant need for
prevention and youth-centric systems and services, as well as strategies to address dispropor-
tionate risks of certain subpopulations.

 Youth homelessness is a serious concern. Evidence shows that
youth who experience homelessness are at high risk of expo-
sure to a range of physical [1] and mental [2,3] health problems,
violence [4], early pregnancy [5], substance use [6], and early death
[7]. However, efforts to solve the problem have been con-
strained by the absence of credible data on the size and
characteristics of the population and reliable means to track youth
homelessness over time. In response, this study was undertak-
en as part of Voices of Youth Count (VoYC), a national research
initiative on youth homelessness led by Chapin Hall at the Uni-
versity of Chicago. The research was designed to address critical
evidence gaps while also responding to the federal Runaway and
Homeless Youth Act (RHYA; P.L. 110–378), which calls for rep-
licable national prevalence and incidence estimates of youth
homelessness and data concerning the population’
s needs and
characteristics.
Federal definitions encompass distinct aspects of youth
homelessness. The Homeless Emergency Assistance and Rapid
Transition to Housing Act of 2009, for example, defines
homelessness partly by individuals’sleeping arrangements—
mainly unsheltered (e.g., sleeping in public places) or sheltered
(e.g., homeless shelter or transitional housing). Moreover, it in-
cludes youth staying with others (e.g., couch surfing or doubling
up) if they are considered homeless under other Federal defini-
tions and meet additional conditions, or if they are fleeing unsafe
situations [8]. Conversely, the RHYA definition makes no refer-
ence to sleeping location. It defines youth homelessness exclusively
by the circumstances of the experience: a person within the defined
age range “for whom it is not possible to live in a safe environ-
ment with a relative, and who has no other safe alternative living
arrangement”[8]. Similarly, studies have used a range of param-
eters and indicators to estimate youth homelessness in the absence
of any “gold standard” measure [9–11].
Moreover, previous estimates of youth homelessness have in-
volved varying age ranges. For example, the U.S. Department of
Housing and Urban Development’
s Annual Homeless Assess-
ment Report [11] documents youth homelessness up to age 24;
other national estimates focus on adolescent years [9,10]. The
RHYA calls for estimates among 13- to 25-year-olds and drives
the age parameters of this study.
Methods for identification and sampling have further impli-
cations for the reliability and inclusiveness of estimates [12]. Point-
in-time counts, which are required of communities funded by
the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development to deliver
homelessness programs, enumerate the number of people ex-
periencing homelessness on a specific night in January and rely
largely on street- and shelter-based identification. This reliance
means that youth experiencing homelessness on other nights or
more hidden forms of homelessness on the night of the count—
such as couch surfing, sleeping in discreet or remote locations,
and youth who actively avoid services and being counted—are
not reflected in the estimates [13]. School-based administrative
and survey data, such as the U.S. Department of Education’
s data
on student homelessness and the Youth Risk Behavior Survey data
based on optional homelessness modules, inherently exclude out-
of-school youth and young adults [10,14]. Given such differences,
previous national estimates of the size of the population expe-
riencing youth homelessness have varied widely.
The present study addressed two primary research ques-
tions. First, what is the estimated 12-month prevalence of
unaccompanied youth homelessness? Second, what youth and
household characteristics are associated with increased risk of
a homeless experience?
We both examine youth homelessness broadly and segment
different forms of homelessness. The broad definition includes
individuals, aged 13–25, living in places not meant for human
habitation, in shelters or transitional housing (or other temporary
housing arrangement), or staying with others while lacking a safe
and stable alternative living arrangement. Couch surfing, which
can reflect a common subset of youth homelessness experiences
(“staying with others”), involves “mov[ing] from one temporary
living arrangement to another without a secure ‘
place to be’
”[15].
However, because some classifications include staying with others
under broader concepts of housing instability rather than
homelessness [16], we report prevalence with and without youth
that only had couch surfing experiences. Running away, also taken
as a subset of youth homelessness experiences, is defined by RHYA
as a minor “who absents himself or herself from home or a place
of legal residence without the permission of a parent or legal guard-
ian.”Unaccompanied, which is variably defined in the literature,
refers in this case to the absence of a parent or legal guardian.
Methods
Sample
We surveyed a nationally representative sample of adults
whose households included 13- to 25-year-olds over the pre-
ceding 12 months. During two rounds of data collection, each
involving different random samples, from July to September 2016
(round 1) and May to July 2017 (round 2), a homelessness module
was added to Gallup, Inc.’
s U.S. Politics and Economics Daily Track-
ing Survey (DTS) [17]. Because we captured 12-month prevalence,
we do not suspect that a lack of seasonal variation in the timing
of data collection was consequential for estimates, although this
would be worth exploring in future research. The DTS used a dual-
frame (cellular and landline) random-digit dial telephone sample
to interview a national quota of 500 adults per day. Daily samples
included quotas of 60% cell phone respondents and 40% landline
respondents. The DTS response rate averages 12%. Although prior
research has found response rate to be an unreliable indicator
of bias, this response rate is also typical of, or slightly higher than,
other phone-based surveys [18].
The second round increased the overall sample size for greater
precision and included follow-up interviews. Follow-up inter-
views were conducted during the second round with a random
sample of respondents who reported any youth homelessness (ex-
plicitly) or couch surfing. Follow-up interviews were generally
conducted within 2–3 days after the respondent’
s completion of
the DTS. We established quotas of 50 completed follow-up in-
terviews for each of three groups: (1) respondents who reported
that a household member aged 13–17 experienced homelessness
or couch surfing, (2) respondents who reported that a house-
hold member aged 18–25 experienced homelessness or couch
surfing, and (3) 18- to 25-year-olds who reported that they ex-
perienced homelessness or couch surfing. The follow-up
interviews response rate was 32%. Although a relatively small
subset of a larger sample, accumulating a substantially larger
subsample would have required a much bigger time period and
cost burden for running the module with the DTS, completing
interviews, and transcription, and coding. Nonetheless, using the
15
M.H. Morton et al. / Journal of Adolescent Health 62 (2018) 14–21
 follow-up interviews for estimating inclusion errors and exam-
ining experiences allowed for markedly greater accuracy and
understanding of the prevalence estimates. Data collection began
after the University of Chicago’
s Institutional Review Board ap-
proval. Respondents provided verbal informed consent.
Measures
This study involved three instruments: the DTS, a brief 19-
item youth homelessness prevalence and incidence module, and
a more detailed follow-up interview protocol. The DTS solicited
demographic characteristics on respondents, including age, sex,
race/ethnicity, household income, employment, education, county
population density, sexual orientation and gender identity, and
marital and parenting status.
The brief youth homelessness module was administered to
adult respondents whose households included members aged 13–
17 or 18–25 and young adults aged 18–25. Reflecting different
experiences of homelessness, we asked adults whose house-
holds included at least one person aged 13–17 if any of those
individuals had (a) run away, (b) left home because of being asked
to leave, (c) couch surfed, or (d) been homeless in the last 12
months. Adults whose households had at least one individual aged
18–25 were asked if any of those individuals had (a) couch surfed
or (b) been homeless. Adults who themselves were aged 18–25
were asked if they had (a) couch surfed or (b) been homeless.
The literature notes stigmatization and varied interpretations
sometimes associated with the term “homeless,” hence the in-
clusion of additional indicators [3]. Before the study, interviewers
field-tested the homelessness module (n = 20); modest changes
were made based on this cognitive testing.
The follow-up interviews involved a mixed-methods ap-
proach, for example, questions with closed and open-ended
response options. Closed queries addressed youth characteristics,
sleepingarrangements,duration,frequencies,vulnerabilities,service
utilization, and causes. Open-ended questions elicited additional
detail about the young person’
s homelessness or couch surfing ex-
periences, causes, and occurrences in which the young person felt
unsafe or in distress. These data also increased our ability to account
for inclusion errors, which occurred if a person or experience was
inappropriately captured in the initial prevalence estimates.
Analyses
For our first research question, we estimated the prevalence
of homelessness by calculating sample proportions along with
associated uncertainty (95% confidence intervals [CIs]) in these
estimates. Population or household weights were used for de-
scriptive statistics to compensate for disproportionalities in
selection probabilities and nonresponders. Based on the propor-
tion of inclusion errors among the follow-up interviews, we made
subsequent adjustments to prevalence estimates. We present seg-
mented estimates of certain types of homelessness, namely,
experiences that the respondent described explicitly as
homelessness (“explicit homelessness”)1 and experiences that
were restricted to couch surfing and not referred to explicitly as
“homelessness” (“couch surfing only”). Further, we include a
broader estimate of any homelessness that combines the two.
For 13- to 17-year-olds, the explicit homelessness category in-
cludes experiences of having been away from home for at least
one night due to running away or being asked to leave.
We estimated two types of 12-month prevalence: (1) house-
hold prevalence, that is, the share of households with youth
members in the specified age groups in which any of those
members had experienced homelessness, and (2) population prev-
alence, that is, the share of the youth population of the specified
age group that experienced homelessness. Because this survey
was administered to adults (aged 18 and over), we could esti-
mate only household prevalence for the 13–17 age group. For 18-
to 25-year-olds, we estimated both household and population
prevalence. Because divergent life stages, normative expecta-
tions, and legal statuses distinguish the subsets of adolescent
minors (13–17) and young adults (18–25), we separated these
groups in analyses.
We used NVivo 11 [19] to conduct qualitative analyses of re-
sponses to open-ended questions in the follow-up interviews.
Based on the broad operational definition of unaccompanied
youth homelessness, two researchers independently reviewed and
compared decisions for including or excluding reported experi-
ences of homelessness from the initial survey. Inter-rater reliability
agreement was 92%, and remaining cases were discussed and
conferenced with a third researcher until 100% consensus was
achieved. We then calculated inclusion error rates and used these
to adjust initial prevalence estimates.
To estimate the number of households with youth aged 13–
17 and 18–25 who had experienced homelessness in the last 12
months, we applied the relevant household prevalence rates to
the number of households in the U.S. with any occupants be-
longing to corresponding age groups, according to the U.S. Census
Bureau’
s 2015 American Community Survey (ACS) data [20]. To
produce a population estimate for individuals aged 18–25, we
applied the population prevalence rates to the number of 18- to
25-year-olds in the U.S. according to 2015 ACS data.
For our second research question, we used Stata 14.0 [21] for
descriptive statistics and logistic regression, examining cross-
sectional bivariate associations of homelessness with various
demographic characteristics and producing unadjusted and ad-
justed risk ratios, reporting 95% CIs for each. To ease interpretation,
we used the Stata command “oddsrisk” to convert odds ratios to
risk ratios with associated CIs [22]. The logistic regression model
was based on the self-reported data for respondents aged 18–
25; these data contained the most information about the young
people themselves because DTS questions referred to the re-
spondents. Additionally, the dependent variable was limited to
explicitly reported homelessness because these reports in-
volved the fewest inclusion errors.
Sample characteristics
The homelessness module was administered to 26,161 of
68,539 DTS respondents (38.2%) who met the eligibility crite-
ria. The sample was broadly representative of the U.S. population
with respect to sex, race/ethnicity, income, and employment (see
Table 1). Prevalence estimates were drawn from three subsamples
of respondents: (1) 13,560 with at least one member aged 13–
17, (2) 16,975 with at least one other household member aged
18–25, and (3) 6,295 who were themselves 18- to 25-years-old
1 We use the term “explicit homelessness” rather than the term “literal
homelessness” because the latter is generally used to refer specifically to sleep-
ing in places not meant for human habitation, in a homelessness shelter, or in
transitional housing. Respondents may or may not have referred to these types
of sleeping arrangements when responding “yes”to the question on homelessness
experiences.
16

 (some respondents belonged to more than one subsample). The
sample size for the follow-up interviews was 150. We tested for
differences on a range of variables including education, employ-
ment, income, and other demographics between the follow-up
interview subsample and the overall sample and found no sig-
nificant differences apart from the modestly younger mean age
of follow-up interview respondents (due to quotas).
Results
Based on initial household prevalence estimates, over a 12-
month period, approximately 3.4% of households with 13- to 17-
year-olds explicitly reported homelessness experiences (including
running away or being asked to leave) among them, and 2.8% re-
ported experiences that solely involved couch surfing, resulting
in an overall 5.3% household prevalence. For ages 18–25, house-
hold prevalence estimates were 6.7% for explicitly reported
homelessness, 14.3% for couch surfing only, and 21.0% overall. The
initial 12-month population prevalence estimates, available only
for ages 18–25, were 5.9%, 9.7%, and 15.6%, respectively.
Additionally, among those reporting explicit homelessness, we
found substantial overlap of couch surfing. Specifically, 64.7% of
18- to 25-year-old respondents self-reporting homelessness also
reported couch surfing.
The combined incidence rates (shares of respondents report-
ing first-time youth homelessness and/or couch surfing cases in
the last 12 months) were 3.0% for respondents reporting expe-
riences of anyone aged 13–17 in their households, 11.3% for
respondents reporting experiences of anyone aged 18–25 in their
households, and 8.3% for respondents aged 18–25 self-reporting
experiences. These were about half as high as the correspond-
ing prevalence rates.
Follow-up interview results showing different types of iden-
tified inclusion errors for different reporting groups are presented
in Table 2. Inclusion errors comprised reports of experiences while
accompanied by a parent or guardian (for minors only),
misreporting (or misunderstanding) regarding the age or time
frame of interest, or, most commonly, reporting apparently safe
and normative experiences that did not involve a lack of access
to stable housing as couch surfing. The inclusion error rates were
substantially lower among respondents reporting explicit
homelessness (12%) than they were for respondents who reported
couch surfing only (54%). Many couch surfing-only experiences
involved normative situations with access to safe and stable
housing and needed to be deducted. Inclusion error rates between
the three quota groups were fairly similar, although we found a
somewhat higher error rate among respondents reporting ex-
plicit homelessness for 13- to 17-year-olds than with respondents
reporting on 18- to 25-year-olds. Given the small subsamples and
general consistency, we applied the inclusion error rates of the
overall follow-up interview sample to the final prevalence cal-
culations, reducing the estimates for explicitly reported
homelessness by 12% and the estimates for couch surfing only
by 54%.
Adjusting for inclusion errors, we estimate that approximate-
ly 4.3% of households with 13- to 17-year-olds, and 12.5% of
households with 18- to 25-year-olds, had people in those age
groups that experienced some form of explicit homelessness and/
or couch surfing without safe and stable housing in the last 12
months. Additionally, 9.7% of 18- to 25-year-olds self-reported

H = homelessness, which includes respondents who responded “yes” to the questions explicitly asking about any youth homelessness, including those who reported
both homelessness and couch surfing; C-o = couch surfing only, which includes respondents who responded “yes” to youth couch surfing and “no” to youth homelessness.
Safe/normative/stably housed experiences that were interpreted as couch surfing included situations such as staying with friends or relatives recreationally or trav-
eling for recreation or work while having access to a safe and stable living arrangement.

 homelessness and/or couch surfing in the last 12 months. Con-
verted to counts based on ACS data, these estimates translate to
approximately 660,000 households with 13- to 17-year-olds, 2.4
million households with 18- to 25-year-olds, and 3.5 million youth
aged 18–25. Table 3 provides these results and segmented esti-
mates for explicit homelessness and couch surfing only.
For the second research question, we examined whether prev-
alence rates for rural counties differed from those of nonrural
counties, and we investigated the correlations between other
covariates and homelessness. Figure 1 displays the explicitly re-
ported homelessness and couch surfing-only household
prevalence rates (adjusting for inclusion errors) in rural and
nonrural counties for ages 13–17 and 18–25 and the popula-
tion prevalence rates for 18- to 25-year-olds. In all reporting
categories, the percentage of respondents in mostly rural coun-
ties reporting youth homelessness was nearly equal to mostly
urban counties. In every case, chi-square goodness of fit tests re-
vealed no significant between-group differences (p > .05).
Results of logistic regression indicated that the unadjusted rel-
ative risk of experiencing homelessness (denoted here as RR, with
95% CI) was significantly greater for young people who reported
the following characteristics: unmarried with children of their own
(RR = 3.00; 2.37–3.76); lesbian, gay, bisexual, or transgender (LGBT;
RR = 2.20; 1.67–2.89); black or African-American (RR = 1.83; 1.42–
2.35); had not completed high school or a general education
diploma (RR = 4.46; 3.54–5.57); and annual household income of
less than $24,000 (RR = 2.62; 2.10–3.24). Young people of Hispan-
ic origin also had higher risk of experiencing homelessness
(RR = 1.32; 1.04–1.67), but the relationship was no longer statis-
tically significant once the model controlled for education and
parenthood. Figure 2 includes forest plots depicting relative risk
(unadjusted and adjusted RRs) for specific demographic groups.

Notes: For ages 13–17, the “explicit homelessness” estimates include experiences of having ran away and been asked to leave; for both ages 13–17 and 18–25 it
includes “yes” responses to the explicit question on homelessness experiences. The revised estimates for “explicit” use a smaller deduction (12%) because this was
the inclusion error rate calculated for this subgroup of experiences based on follow-up interviews. The revised estimates for “couch surfing only” use a larger de-
duction (54%) because this was the inclusion error rate calculated for this subgroup of experiences, which included a high proportion of experiences that were not
couch surfing as a form of homelessness—that is, the young people did not lack a safe and stable place to stay.

 Discussion
This study produced the first national estimates of 12-
month prevalence of youth homelessness in the U.S. for ages 13–
25. Although they encompass a spectrum of experiences, our
prevalence estimates imply a much broader national challenge
than do point-in-time counts or public schools data by them-
selves. If the 2016 Annual Homeless Assessment Report numbers
of 3,916 unaccompanied minors and 41,662 youth aged 18–24
[23], based on nationally aggregated point-in-time counts of youth
(including parenting youth), were to be converted to national
prevalence rates, these would reflect percentages of less than .02%
of 13- to 17-year-olds and .14% of 18- to 24-year-olds on a spe-
cific night. Apart from the focus that point-in-time counts have
on certain types of homelessness (unsheltered and in shelters or
transitional housing), substantial differences are likely due to the
facts that our survey captures 12-month prevalence and uses a
population-based sampling approach to study a largely hidden
and dynamic phenomenon. Our estimates for adolescents also
significantly exceed the national public schools count of
Figure 2. Logistic regressions for youth homelessness (aged 18–25, self-report). Note: The dependent variable is explicitly reported homelessness (excluding couch
surfing only). Unadjusted relative risks (RRs) express associations between homelessness and one other variable only (e.g., female). Adjusted RRs present variable-
wise RRs having controlled for all other variables in the model. Diamonds represent the RR while the extending lines on either side of the diamonds represent corresponding
95% CIs. A filled diamond indicates that the RR is statistically significant (p < .05). An RR of 1.0 means that risk is even between two groups. Each RR represents the
difference in risk of having experienced homelessness between the group described by the variable (e.g., females) and its opposite reference group (e.g., males). The
reference group for the “younger age group (18–21)” is respondents aged 22–25. Race variables compare to all others, of which the majority are White non-Hispanic
(e.g., for Black or African-American, the reference group is all youth who were not Black or African-American). For the unemployed variable, the reference group is
all youth who were not unemployed, including those who were employed or who were not in the labor force. Parent (unmarried) = the youth was an unmarried
parent; Ann. hh income = annual household income.

 unaccompanied students (95,032 in the 2014–15 school year [14]),
conceivably because a representative survey approach does
not depend on formal reports or school identification of
homelessness.
Looking to other representative surveys—only available for
adolescents—our estimates are more similar. For example,
Ringwalt et al. found a 5.0% 12-month prevalence rate of
homelessness among 12- to 17-year-olds in 1992–1993, al-
though this included self-reports (population prevalence) and both
accompanied and unaccompanied homelessness [9]. More re-
cently, local and state estimates of prevalence of unaccompanied
homelessness among high school students from representative
school-based surveys have ranged from 2.2% to 2.9%, although
these were based on a stricter measure of unaccompanied
homelessness: typically sleeping somewhere other than home
without a parent or guardian over the last month [10].
Nearly two thirds of youth who reported explicit homelessness
also reported couch surfing over the last 12 months. This un-
derscores the fluidity of young people’
s arrangements over time.
Many youth do not fit squarely into any single type of
homelessness experience. Still, a sizable share of the overall prev-
alence rates also involved couch surfing only without a safe and
stable living arrangement. These experiences likely include a wide
range of degrees of vulnerability (from lower-risk experiences of
leveraging social networks during periods of housing instabili-
ty to high-risk or exploitative arrangements) [15,24]. Additionally,
some couch surfing could function as a precursor to more en-
trenched homelessness [25]. Given these complexities,
assessments of youths’circumstances beyond their sleeping ar-
rangement at a given time are important to determining their
levels of risk and service needs.
Prior to this study, little was known about how the preva-
lence of youth homelessness in rural areas compared with
nonrural areas. Our results indicate that youth homelessness is
equally prevalent in both areas. Tailored policies and programs
to address the unique circumstances of youth homelessness in
rural communities—such as a lack of service infrastructure and
lower visibility due to absence of urban magnet spots that attract
youth—may be needed.
Our findings reinforce growing evidence on the heightened
risk of experiencing homelessness among LGBT youth [26,27].
Disproportionality of homelessness experiences among black
youth mirrors racial disparities documented elsewhere, for
example, school suspensions, juvenile justice involvement and
sentencing, and foster care placements [28,29]. Furthermore, al-
though Hispanic youth were at higher risk than non-Hispanic
youth of experiencing homelessness (and comprised 34% of 18-
to 25-year-olds reporting homelessness), only 19% of youth served
by federally funded runaway and homeless youth programs in
FY 2014 were Hispanic [30].
One of the strongest risk correlates for homelessness was a
lack of a high school diploma or GED. Although we cannot make
causal inferences, this finding reinforces the extent to which ed-
ucation, and underlying factors that support educational
attainment, might protect youth from becoming homeless. Young
parents were also at high risk for homelessness relative to their
nonparenting peers, suggesting that more attention should be paid
to the relationship between early parenthood and homelessness.
The findings also indicate a marked need for coordination among
youth and family homelessness service providers, as well as in-
terventions designed with the unique needs of young parents and
their children in mind.
Both the scale of youth homelessness experiences (repre-
sented by our 12-month prevalence estimates) and the extent
of new cases over a 12-month period (represented by our inci-
dence estimates), reinforce the extent to which prevention and
early intervention are needed. Downstream interventions to help
currently homeless youth gain stable housing and positive tran-
sitions to adulthood are vital but insufficient to ending youth
homelessness. The extant literature has identified key entry points
for advancing prevention, such as with family interventions, school
dropout prevention, public systems including child welfare and
justice systems, and affordable and subsidized housing [31,32].
A particular strength of this study lies in its methodology,
which is replicable and cost-efficient, given that it builds on ex-
isting sampling and survey infrastructure and does not require
on-the-ground data collection. This enables the option of re-
peated national estimates over time to track progress toward the
Federal Government’
s goal of ending youth homelessness [33].
However, some limitations of the study should be kept in mind
when interpreting the results and considering enhancements of
future national estimates.
First, because Gallup’
s DTS surveys adults, we relied on third-
party household reports of experiences of individuals aged 13–
17, which could have been influenced by social desirability and
recall biases. Second, only household prevalence estimates could
be generated for ages 13–17 because the survey module asked
about the experiences of any youth in the household, not each
13- to 17-year-old who lived there. To the extent that more than
one 13- to 17-year-old in some households had experienced
homelessness, this might have resulted in a more conservative
estimate of the population size. Conversely, reporting house-
holds could have functioned as either “sending”households (from
which youth left into homelessness) or “receiving” households
(where youth stayed during or after homelessness), and this could
contribute to a degree of inflation. Third, we found and cor-
rected for a large inclusion error rate of 54% for respondents
reporting couch surfing only, and a much smaller inclusion error
rate of 12% for explicitly reported homelessness. A more de-
tailed homelessness and housing module would allow for
improved precision of initial prevalence estimates (i.e., fewer in-
clusion errors), particularly in terms of capturing forms of couch
surfing that reflect homelessness. This would be preferable to post
hoc deductions based on estimated inclusion errors from a smaller
subsample. Finally, sampling biases were possible if youth ex-
periencing homelessness were less likely to have phones or
respond to a phone-based survey than their stably housed peers.
Yet, this approach is likely preferable to sampling based on mailing
or visiting homes for reaching unstably housed youth, and re-
search suggests that many homeless youth are technology-
connected
[34].
Nonetheless,
this
survey
likely
yields
underestimates of homelessness to the extent that it misses young
people who lack working cell phones and have been totally dis-
connected from households that could report on their experiences.
Although individual experiences vary, homelessness and
housing instability clearly have adverse consequences for young
people and their futures. This effort demonstrates the feasibili-
ty of estimating national prevalence and incidence of youth
homelessness using a cost-efficient methodology with poten-
tial for enhancement and replication to track progress and target
solutions to preventing and ending this hidden problem. Our find-
ings reveal that the challenge involves a scale that necessitates
greater coordination and resourcing of multiple systems and
programs—behavioral and physical health, child welfare,

 education, employment, housing, justice, and outreach—at local,
state, and federal levels to drive these numbers toward zero.
