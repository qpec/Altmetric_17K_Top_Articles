IMPORTANCE Over the past 2 decades, there has been increased attention and effort to
reduce disparities in live donor kidney transplantation (LDKT) for black, Hispanic, and Asian
patients with end-stage kidney disease. The goal of this study was to investigate whether
these efforts have been successful.
OBJECTIVE To estimate changes over time in racial/ethnic disparities in LDKT in the United
States, accounting for differences in death and deceased donor kidney transplantation.
DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS A secondary analysis of a prospectively maintained
cohort study conducted in the United States of 453 162 adult first-time kidney
transplantation candidates included in the Scientific Registry of Transplant Recipients
between January 1, 1995, and December 31, 2014, with follow-up through December 31, 2016.
EXPOSURES Race/ethnicity.
MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES The primary study outcome was time to LDKT.
Multivariable Cox proportional hazards and competing risk models were constructed to
assess changes in racial/ethnic disparities in LDKT among adults on the deceased donor
kidney transplantation waiting list and interaction terms were used to test the statistical
significance of temporal changes in racial/ethnic differences in receipt of LDKT. The adjusted
subhazard ratios are estimates derived from the multivariable competing risk models. Data
were categorized into 5-year increments (1995-1999, 2000-2004, 2005-2009, 2010-2014)
to allow for an adequate sample size in each analytical cell.
RESULTS Among 453 162 adult kidney transplantation candidates (mean [SD] age, 50.9 [13.1]
years; 39% were women; 48% were white; 30%, black; 16%, Hispanic; and 6%, Asian), 59 516
(13.1%) received LDKT. Overall, there were 39 509 LDKTs among white patients, 8926 among
black patients, 8357 among Hispanic patients, and 2724 among Asian patients. In 1995, the
cumulative incidence of LDKT at 2 years after appearing on the waiting list was 7.0% among
white patients, 3.4% among black patients, 6.8% among Hispanic patients, and 5.1% among
Asian patients. In 2014, the cumulative incidence of LDKT was 11.4% among white patients,
2.9% among black patients, 5.9% among Hispanic patients, and 5.6% among Asian patients.
From 1995-1999 to 2010-2014, racial/ethnic disparities in the receipt of LDKT increased
(P < .001 for all statistical interaction terms in adjusted models comparing white patients vs
black, Hispanic, and Asian patients). In 1995-1999, compared with receipt of LDKT among white
patients, the adjusted subhazard ratio was 0.45 (95% CI, 0.42-0.48) among black patients,
0.83 (95% CI, 0.77-0.88) among Hispanic patients, and 0.56 (95% CI, 0.50-0.63) among Asian
patients. In 2010-2014, compared with receipt of LDKT among white patients, the adjusted
subhazard ratio was 0.27 (95% CI, 0.26-0.28) among black patients, 0.52 (95% CI, 0.50-0.54)
among Hispanic patients, and 0.42 (95% CI, 0.39-0.45) among Asian patients.
CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE Among adult first-time kidney transplantation candidates in
the United States who were added to the deceased donor kidney transplantation waiting list
between 1995 and 2014, disparities in the receipt of live donor kidney transplantation
increased from 1995-1999 to 2010-2014. These findings suggest that national strategies for
addressing disparities in receipt of live donor kidney transplantation should be revisited.

ive donor kidney transplantation accounts for approxi-
mately one-third of kidney transplants performed in the
United States.1 Live donor kidney transplantation is as-
sociatedwithimprovedclinicaloutcomesandqualityoflifefor
clinically suitable patients with end-stage kidney disease com-
pared with receiving long-term dialysis treatment or deceased
donorkidneytransplantation.1,2 Nationaldatasince1988show
that patients from racial/ethnic minority groups are less likely
to receive live donor kidney transplantation than white pa-
tientsdespitehavingadisproportionatelyhigherburdenofend-
stage kidney disease.1,2 Prior studies3-6 suggested that racial/
ethnic disparities in live donor kidney transplantation may be
attributable to barriers encountered at multiple steps along the
path to successful live donor kidney transplantation. The steps
during which these barriers may be encountered include dur-
ingreferral,identificationandpursuitofpotentiallivingdonors,
evaluation, and treatment decision making by the clinician,
potential donor, and potential recipient.
Over the last 2 decades, dozens of interventions address-
ing racial/ethnic disparities in live donor kidney transplanta-
tionhavebeendevelopedandimplementedinsingle-centerand
small multicenter environments.5-14 These interventions have
addressed a wide range of barriers including knowledge, con-
cerns,andclinicalcharacteristicsofthelivedonorkidneytrans-
plantation recipient and donor; beliefs, attitudes, and behav-
iors of health care clinicians; and awareness, attitudes, and
diseaseburdenoftheUSpopulation.5-14Inadditiontothesepro-
grams, US policy makers have enacted federal and state legis-
lation over the past 2 decades that primarily targeted the re-
duction of economic barriers for potential living donors.15

Methods
Data Source
This study was reviewed by the institutional review board at
the Johns Hopkins University School of Medicine. The board
determined that the study qualified for an exemption under
the Code of Federal Regulations16 because the study partici-
pants cannot be identified directly or through linked identi-
fiers. The study used data from the Scientific Registry of Trans-
plant Recipients (SRTR).
The SRTR system includes data on all donors, candidates,
and transplantation recipients in the United States that are
submittedbythemembersoftheOrganProcurementandTrans-
plantationNetwork(OPTN).TheHealthResourcesandServices
AdministrationwithintheUSDepartmentofHealthandHuman
Services oversees the activities of the OPTN and SRTR contrac-
tors.DatafromtheSRTRwerelinkedatthe5-digitzipcodelevel
withneighborhoodsocioeconomicstatusandpovertydatausing
the American Community Surveys from the US Census.
Study Design
The study population included adults (aged ≥18 years) on the
deceased donor kidney transplantation waiting list for a first
kidney transplantation between January 1, 1995, and Decem-
ber 31, 2014. On the OPTN adult kidney transplantation reg-
istration forms, which were completed by clinicians at the
transplantation center, the race/ethnicity of all candidates in-
cluded in this study was designated using 1 of the following
fixed categories: white, black/African American, Hispanic/
Latino, or Asian. This study was not sufficiently powered to
examine temporal changes in live donor kidney transplanta-
tion disparities among candidates identified as American
Indian or Alaska Native, Native Hawaiian or other Pacific
Islander, or multiracial due to the small population sizes dur-
ing some of the years. Five candidates (0.001%) did not have
a racial/ethnic assignment and were excluded from the study.
The primary study outcome of time to live donor kidney trans-
plantation was determined by the transplant date docu-
mented on the OPTN forms by the transplantation center.
Statistical Analysis
Descriptive Data Analysis
Clinicalanddemographiccharacteristicswerestratifiedbykid-
ney transplantation candidate race/ethnicity and year of place-
mentonthedeceaseddonorkidneytransplantationwaitinglist.
Wilcoxon rank sum (for continuous variables) and χ2 tests
(for categorical variables) were performed to compare distribu-
tions and assess statistical significance. Kaplan-Meier meth-
ods, which accounted for the competing risks of deceased do-
nor kidney transplantation and mortality, were used to assess
candidate racial/ethnic differences in the estimated cumula-
tiveincidenceoflivedonorkidneytransplantationat2yearsaf-
ter appearing on the waiting list. In addition, among live donor
kidney transplantation recipients, racial/ethnic differences in
recipient and donor characteristics were assessed over time.
Wilcoxon rank sum and χ2 tests were performed to assess sta-
tistical significance between racial/ethnic differences.

Key Points
Question Have racial/ethnic disparities in the receipt of live donor
kidney transplantation (LDKT) narrowed over the last 2 decades in
the United States?
Findings In this study of 453 162 adult first-time kidney
transplantation candidates, the cumulative incidence of LDKT
receipt at 2 years after appearing on the waiting list increased from
7.0% in 1995 to 11.4% in 2014 among white patients, decreased
from 3.4% to 2.9% among black patients, decreased from 6.8% to
5.9% among Hispanic patients, and increased from 5.1% to 5.6%
among Asian patients, which represent a significant increase in
racial/ethnic disparities over time.
Meaning Racial/ethnic disparities in receipt of LDKT increased
from 1995-1999 to 2010-2014, suggesting that national strategies
to reduce LDKT disparities have not been effective.

after placement on the waiting list.
Patients were censored at the first documented date of
death; receipt of deceased donor kidney transplantation; at 2
years after initial placement on the deceased donor kidney
transplantation waiting list; at the date of removal from the
deceased donor kidney transplantation waiting list due to rea-
sons other than receipt of kidney transplantation or death; or
at the end of the study observation period on December 31,
2016. The decision to censor patients at 2 years after appear-
ing on the waiting list was informed by a prior study of na-
tional data reporting that most live donor kidney transplan-
tations occurred within the first 6 months of being listed.4
All regression models were adjusted for biologically plau-
sible confounders (age, sex, body mass index [calculated as
weightinkilogramsdividedbyheightinmeterssquared],panel
reactive antibody, and ABO blood type) measured at the time
of appearing on the waiting list. Statistical interaction terms
were used in regression models to formally test the statistical
significance of temporal changes in racial/ethnic disparities in
the receipt of live donor kidney transplantation. To evaluate
whether differences in live donor kidney transplantation were
related to differences in deceased donor kidney transplanta-
tion or death (ie, informative censoring), the main analyses
were repeated using competing risk models according to the
methods of Fine and Gray17 (estimating adjusted subhazard ra-
tios). The analyses in which death and deceased donor kid-
ney transplantation were treated as separate competing risk
events were adjusted for the same variables described above.
Sensitivity Analysis
To test the robustness of the estimates, all analyses were re-
peated in (1) a contemporary cohort of kidney transplanta-
tion candidates who were added to the deceased donor

 kidney transplantation waiting list between 2000 and 2014,
(2) an expanded cohort of kidney transplantation candidates
who were added to the deceased donor kidney transplanta-
tion waiting list between 1995 and 2014 plus candidates who
received live donor kidney transplantation preemptively be-
tween 1995 and 2014 without placement on the deceased do-
nor kidney transplantation waiting list, and (3) a reduced co-
hort of active status only kidney transplantation candidates
who were added to the deceased donor kidney transplanta-
tion waiting list between 1995 and 2014.
Additional models were used to examine the extent to
which the racial/ethnic differences in potential mediators of
(1) health care access and socioeconomic status factors (neigh-
borhood poverty level, education level, health insurance type,
time receiving dialysis) and (2) transplantation center factors
(distance to center, kidney transplantation candidate vol-
ume, percentage of nonwhite kidney transplantation candi-
dates, median time to deceased donor kidney transplanta-
tion, live donor kidney transplantation volume) influenced the
primary findings. To estimate the influence of these poten-
tial mediators on racial/ethnic disparities in live donor kid-
ney transplantation, these factors were incrementally incor-
poratedintotheCoxregressionandthecompetingriskmodels.
Model Testing and Statistical Significance
Complementary log-log plots and Schoenfeld residuals were
examined to assess the proportional hazards assumption. The
variance inflation factor and Eigen values were used to test for
colinearityamongthevectorofexplanatoryvariables.Thestan-
dard SRTR risk adjustment approach was used for handling
missing data. With the SRTR approach, missing variable lev-
els were modeled separately from known variable levels in the
regression models. The robustness of estimates was tested by

list removal due to reasons other than receipt of kidney trans-
plantation or death (n = 50 748), or at 2 years after initial list-
ing (n = 226 237). Of all live donor kidney transplantation re-
cipients, 87.5% received live donor kidney transplantation
within 2 years of placement on the waiting list and these out-

on the waiting list, which is outside the study scope, 12.5% of
patients received live donor kidney transplantations.
Mean age, body mass index, and prevalence of end-stage
kidney disease secondary to diabetes increased from 1995 to
2014. Black and Hispanic patients were younger and also less
likely to have college degrees than Asian and white patients.
The prevalence of private health insurance was highest among
white and Asian patients, and the prevalence of Medicare as
the primary coverage was highest among black and Hispanic
patients. The prevalence of end-stage kidney disease due to

Temporal Changes in Receipt of Live Donor Kidney
Transplantation by Candidate Race/Ethnicity
In 1995, the cumulative incidence of live donor kidney trans-
plantation at 2 years after placement on the deceased donor
kidney transplantation waiting list was 7.0% among white pa-
tients, 3.4% among black patients, 6.8% among Hispanic pa-
tients, and 5.1% among Asian patients; in 2014, the cumula-
tive incidence of live donor kidney transplantation at 2 years
after placement on the deceased donor kidney transplanta-
tion waiting list was 11.4% among white patients, 2.9% among
blackpatients,5.9%amongHispanicpatients,and5.6%among
Asian patients (Figure 1A). Temporal changes in racial/ethnic
differences in receipt of deceased donor kidney transplanta-
tion (Figure 1B) and mortality (Figure 1C) also were observed
during the study period.
In 1995-1999, there were 5472 live donor kidney trans-
plantations within 2 years of placement on the waiting list
among white patients, 1351 among black patients, 999 among
Hispanic patients, and 316 among Asian patients. In 2000-
2004, there were 9096 live donor kidney transplantations
among white patients, 2445 among black patients, 1963
among Hispanic patients, and 605 among Asian patients. In
2005-2009, there were 12 293 live donor kidney transplanta-
tions among white patients, 2718 among black patients, 2628
among Hispanic patients, and 834 among Asian patients. In
2010-2014, there were 12 648 live donor kidney transplanta-
tions among white patients, 2412 among black patients, 2767
among Hispanic patients, and 969 among Asian patients
(Table 3).
In the models that treated death and deceased donor kid-
ney transplantation as competing risks, adjusted for biologi-
callyplausibleconfounders,andcomparedreceiptoflivedonor
kidney transplantation in the 1995-1999 cohort, the adjusted
subhazard ratio for the receipt of live donor kidney transplan-
tation in the 2010-2014 cohort was 1.86 (95% CI, 1.80-1.92)
among white patients, 1.13 (95% CI, 1.06-1.21) among black pa-
tients, 1.17 (95% CI, 1.09-1.26) among Hispanic patients, and
1.39 (95% CI, 1.23-1.58) among Asian patients (Table 4).
Results from unadjusted models (Table 4), Cox models (eTable

2, eTable 3, eTable 4, and eTable 5 in the Supplement) also
reflect racial/ethnic differences in temporal changes in the re-
ceipt of live donor kidney transplantation.

Potential Mechanisms Influencing Racial/Ethnic Disparities
in Receipt of Live Donor Kidney Transplantation
Findings from exploratory models suggest that among black
and Hispanic patients, adjustments for differences in health
care access and socioeconomic status factors were more
strongly related to attenuating disparities in live donor kid-
ney transplantation than transplantation center factors. How-
ever, even in fully adjusted models, live donor kidney trans-
plantation disparities substantially increased over time for
black and Hispanic patients (Figure 2). In additional stratified
models, the magnitude of the increase over time in racial/
ethnic disparities in the receipt of live donor kidney transplan-
tation was greater for black patients and Hispanic patients (1)
living in poorer (vs wealthier) neighborhoods, (2) without (vs
with) a college degree, and (3) with Medicare (vs private) in-
surance (eTable 2 in the Supplement).
Characteristics of Live Donor Kidney Transplantation
Recipients and Donors From 1995-1999 to 2010-2014
In secondary models, temporal changes in live donor kidney
transplantation recipient and donor characteristics were ex-
plored by race/ethnicity. Across all racial/ethnic groups, live
donor kidney transplantation recipients in 2010-2014 were
more likely to be older, male, have a college degree, and re-
ceive preemptive live donor kidney transplantation than those
in 1995-1999. Donors of live donor kidney transplantation in
2010-2014weremorelikelytobeolderorfemale,andlesslikely
to be biologically related or concordant by race/ethnicity with

 1995-1999to2010-2014.Exploratorystudyfindingssuggestthat
racial/ethnic differences in health care access and socioeco-
nomic status factors may be related to the increasing racial/
ethnic disparities in the receipt of live donor kidney transplan-
tation among black and Hispanic patients.
These findings are consistent with and build on prior study
findings that racial/ethnic disparities in socioeconomic sta-
tus measures, including education and health insurance cov-
erage, may be associated with racial/ethnic differences in the
receipt and timing of specialist kidney care from a nephrolo-
gist prior to end-stage kidney disease.18-20 Delays in the re-
ceipt of kidney care may also contribute to reported racial/
ethnic differences in the quality and timing of patient-
clinician and family-clinician discussions about live donor
kidney transplantation as a treatment option.10,21
Secondary study findings that live donor kidney trans-
plantation recipients in 2010-2014 were less likely to have a
biologically related donor than those in 1995-1999 are consis-
tent with prior work documenting a decrease in national rates
of living donation from relatives in the United States.22
Declines in living donation from relatives may reflect an in-
creasing prevalence of risk factors for end-stage kidney dis-
ease (eg, obesity, diabetes, and hypertension) and other clini-
cal contraindications to live donation within the families of
kidneytransplantationcandidates.23-27Inthisstudy,thepreva-
lence of end-stage kidney disease due to diabetes or hyper-
tension increased to greater than 72% for black patients and
68% for Hispanic patients compared with 46% for white pa-
tients. Familial clustering of end-stage kidney disease risk fac-
tors may also contribute to the difficulties reported by black
and Hispanic patients in identifying suitable living donors
within their families and close social networks.5,21

location occurred during the study period. In 2003, the United

 Network for Organ Sharing, which oversees OPTN, approved
a change in deceased donor kidney allocation that eliminated
theprioritypointsgiventoHLA-Bmatching.28,29Previousstud-
ies reported that this change was associated with a reduction
in the disparity between black and white patients in the re-
ceipt of deceased donor kidney transplantation.28,29
Consistent with prior studies, there was a similar reduc-
tion in the racial disparity in deceased donor kidney trans-
plantation in this study. Findings from models accounting for
deceased donor kidney transplantation and death as compet-
ing risks yielded similar results to models censoring for de-
ceased donor kidney transplantation and death. Racial/
ethnicdisparitiesinlivedonorkidneytransplantationincreased
in recent years, even after accounting for differences in de-
ceased donor kidney transplantation and death.
In addition, study findings of an increasing prevalence of
Hispanic adult kidney transplantation candidates and an in-
crease in disparities in live donor kidney transplantation re-
inforce calls for culturally targeted programs to overcome bar-
riers to live donor kidney transplantation in the Hispanic
community.30,31 A recent review of culturally competent strat-
egies to increase knowledge regarding live donor kidney trans-
plantation in Hispanic communities concluded that only 3 cul-
turally targeted interventions have been developed and
evaluated since 2010.30 These interventions, including a mass
and social media campaign, exposure to a bilingual website,
andtransplantationcenterprovisionoflivedonorkidneytrans-
plantation education and culturally and linguistically compe-
tent care, were found to be effective in increasing knowledge
aboutlivedonorkidneytransplantation.30-33Increasedlivedo-
nor kidney transplantation knowledge in Hispanic communi-
ties and culturally appropriate decision support may be im-
portant for addressing disparities in patients’willingness to
identify and approach potential donors in their families and
close social networks.30-33
Findings from this study suggest that current efforts to re-
duce live donor kidney transplantation disparities need to be
revisited, perhaps with a national strategy initiative. Al-
though center-level patient engagement strategies are impor-
tant for removing disincentives to live donor kidney trans-
plantation, the implementation of national, evidence-based
strategies to address live donor kidney transplantation dis-
parities would likely be more effective.
Potential strategies could include national dissemination
of evidence-based culturally and linguistically appropriate live
donor kidney transplantation educational materials, online
communities, patient navigation services, and policies to stan-
dardize and increase the availability of kidney exchanges and
chains to help overcome immunological barriers for recipient-
donor pairs. Collaborations among researchers, patient advo-
cates, and policy makers are also needed to monitor the ef-
fects of legislative efforts on racial/ethnic minorities and to
directly target identified barriers to achieving transplanta-
tion equity.
This study has several strengths. The first is the ability to
comprehensively analyze 2 decades of national data to assess
temporal changes in live donor kidney transplantation by race/
ethnicity. A second strength is the ability to examine a well-
characterized US population of adult kidney transplantation
candidates with comprehensive follow-up for transplanta-
tion,death,orwaitinglistremoval.Athirdstrengthofthestudy
istheabilitytoaccountfordifferencesinmanyimportantchar-
acteristics that might confound or potentially mediate ob-
served associations.
Limitations
The study also has a number of limitations. The first is that
the study was limited by the variables available in the SRTR,
including clinician-reported race/ethnicity and comorbidi-
ties, which has some potential for misclassification bias.
The second limitation is the inability to further subcategorize
the broad racial/ethnic categories available in the national reg-
istry (ie, Hispanic/Latino, Asian, black/African American, and
white) to identify unique barriers to live donor kidney trans-
plantation in more disadvantaged racial/ethnic subgroups.
The third is the inability to assess the extent to which poten-
tial racial/ethnic differences in preferences about and willing-
ness to pursue live donor kidney transplantation among
kidney transplantation candidates may be related to our ob-
served findings. The fourth limitation is that the study was un-
able to account for individual-level patient income. Even
though zip-code level measures are important proxies,20 the
future availability of individual-level income in national reg-
istries would allow researchers to better delineate the extent
to which trends in individual-level income may have contrib-
uted to changes in racial/ethnic disparities in live donor kid-
ney transplantation.
Conclusions
Among adult first-time kidney transplantation candidates in
the United States who were added to the deceased donor kid-
ney transplantation waiting list between 1995 and 2014, dis-
parities in the receipt of live donor kidney transplantation in-
creased from 1995-1999 to 2010-2014. These findings suggest
that national strategies for addressing disparities in receipt of
live donor kidney transplantation should be revisited.
