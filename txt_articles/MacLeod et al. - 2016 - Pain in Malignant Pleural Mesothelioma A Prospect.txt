Abstract
Introduction.
Malignant
pleural
mesothelioma
(MPM) is associated with severe pain. The underly-
ing neurobiology of this is complex. The primary
aim of this study was to characterize pain in MPM.
Methods. This study was undertaken as part of a trial
examining radiotherapy for the treatment of pain in
MPM (ISRCTN 10644347). Patients had MPM with
associated pain for which radiotherapy was planned
and a worst pain score� 4/10. The following assess-
ments were undertaken: clinical neuropathic pain as-
sessment,
Brief
Pain
Inventory
(BPI),
Leeds
Assessment of Neuropathic Symptoms and Signs
(LANSS), Short form of the McGill Pain Questionnaire
(SF-MPQ), and Quantitative Sensory Testing (QST).
The relationship of these characteristics and re-
sponse to radiotherapy was assessed. Unless stated,
medians and interquartile range (IQR) are used.
Results.
Thirty-seven
patients
were
recruited.
Average pain and worst pain was 4 (4-6) and 8 (6-8),
respectively. Higher average pain and higher worst
pain scores were associated with higher interfer-
ence scores on the BPI, P < 0.001 and P < 0.0005.
Twenty patients (54%) had a clinical diagnosis of
neuropathic pain, and of these, only six patients
(40%) screened positively for neuropathic pain
using the LANSS. Patients with a high LANSS also
had higher BPI and SF-MPQs. The presence of
neuropathic pain (clinically or by LANSS) did not
predict response to radiotherapy, P < 0.05. The SF-
MPQ scores were higher in those with abnormal
cool sensation on QST (P 5 0.016).
Conclusion. Pain in mesothelioma varies among pa-
tients and may have neuropathic components. An
adequate pain assessment is necessary to guide the
clinician in the appropriate choice of analgesics.

Introduction
Malignant pleural mesothelioma (MPM) is an uncommon
cancer but is associated with significant morbidity and
mortality. The United Kingdom has the highest inci-
dence of MPM in the world and this figure is expected
to peak in the next few years [1,2]. Of all the symptoms
associated with MPM, pain is the most common and
the most challenging to treat [3,4]. Patients often have
uncontrolled pain despite multiple analgesics, and one
of the reasons for this is that the underlying pathophysi-
ology and resultant neurobiology is complex. Pain may
be due to tumor infiltration of the chest wall, ribs, nerve
roots, intercostal nerves, neurovascular bundle, or a
combination of these. The associated pro-inflammatory
cytokine response and other tumor-mediated factors
may complicate further the neurobiological process. In
addition, in patients who undergo surgery, post thora-
cotomy pain is often present [5]. The pain associated

 with MPM is often more severe and difficult to treat than
pain caused by lung cancer [6].
In the clinic, pain associated with MPM is presumed to
be due to bone and neuropathic pain mechanisms. In
cancer, the effect of malignant invasion of bone result-
ing in pain is not wholly understood but is thought to be
primarily initiated through nociceptors in the periosteum
[7]. In the setting of neuropathic pain, while primary in-
jury of the nervous system is required, ongoing nocicep-
tive stimulation results in recruitment of non-nociceptive
receptors resulting in pain from non-noxious stimuli and
leading to a central sensitisation [8]. As a result, anal-
gesics, which target different pain mechanisms, are
often required; however, the clinical characteristics of
cancer pain of mixed mechanisms havee not been well
described. Furthermore, the clinical characterization of
pain in MPM has not been described.
An improved understanding of these clinical characteris-
tics may inform the choice of analgesic therapy (includ-
ing radiotherapy) in MPM. Furthermore, if factors were
identified that predicted those patients more likely to re-
spond to radiotherapy, then treatment could be directed
appropriately.
Therefore, the primary aim of the present study was to
characterize pain in MPM. A secondary aim was to es-
tablish if any pain characteristics were predictive of
those patients who were more likely to respond to
radiotherapy for treatment of pain related to MPM.
Methods
This study was undertaken as part of a larger trial
examining the role of radiotherapy for the treatment of
pain in MPM (ISRCTN 10644347), the findings of which
are presented elsewhere [9]. The study followed the
procedures of the Declaration of Helsinki and Good
Clinical Practice. Patients were recruited from three UK
cancer centres: the Beatson West of Scotland Cancer
Centre
Glasgow,
the
Edinburgh
Cancer
Centre
in
Edinburgh,
and Weston Park
Hospital
in
Sheffield.
Ethical approval was obtained and all patients provided
written informed consent.
Eligible patients met the following criteria: 18 years of
age or over; a diagnosis of MPM (histological or multi-
disciplinary team), mesothelioma related pain (� 4/10
(0–10 Numerical Rating Scale)) for which radiotherapy
was planned (based on a decision made by the treating
oncologist that pain was sufficient), a life expectancy of
at least 3 months, and a performance status of 0–2
(Eastern
Cooperative
Oncology
Group
–
ECOG).
Patients were recruited from June 2012 until December
2013.
There was no specific requirement regarding analgesics
prior to study entry. However, patients were assessed
by a palliative medicine consultant on at least one occa-
sion prior to study entry in an attempt to optimize
analgesia. Weak and strong opioids were defined as per
the WHO analgesic ladder for cancer pain relief [10]. In
all patients, the primary indication for taking an opioid
was mesothelioma-related pain, and patients had been
titrated to maximal tolerable dose but by definition still
had
sub-optimal
pain
control
(�4/10
on
a
0–10
Numerical Rating Scale).
Patients were excluded from the study if they had
received chemotherapy or radiotherapy in the preceding
6 weeks that was likely to alter pain during the duration
of the study. Patients in whom chemotherapy was
planned during the study period were also excluded.
The diagnosis of neuropathic pain was made clinically.
This was informed by knowledge of the underlying dis-
ease, a detailed pain history (including patient volun-
teered descriptors), and supported by positive (e.g.,
spontaneous pain, allodynia, hyperalgesia) or negative
(e.g., sensory loss) features suggestive of neuropathic
pain.
Procedures
All patients underwent a detailed clinical pain assess-
ment and completed the following questionnaires: the
Brief
Pain
Inventory
(BPI),
Leeds
Assessment
of
Neuropathic Symptoms and Signs (LANSS), and the
Short form McGill Pain Questionnaire (SF-MPQ). Where
a clinical diagnosis of neuropathic pain was made, this
was noted. Patients also underwent psychophysical
tests using Quantitative Sensory Testing (QST). All as-
sessments were performed prior to radiotherapy.
Brief Pain Inventory
The BPI is a multi-dimensional pain assessment tool
that assesses intensity and interference of pain on daily
function (e.g., sleep, mood, relationships, work). It was
developed for use in cancer patients and has been ex-
tensively validated in both cancer and non-cancer pa-
tients
[11–13].
The
individual
components
of
the
intensity and interference subscales can be assessed in
isolation or in combination. In the present study, a clin-
ically meaningful improvement in pain was defined as a
30% drop in total BPI score at week 5 (study endpoint)
from baseline [13].
McGill Pain Questionnaire
The SF-MPQ has been validated in neuropathic and
non-neuropathic pain to rate the intensity and quality of
pain [14].
Leeds Assessment for Neuropathic Symptom Score
(LANSS)
The LANSS was developed in 2001, in chronic non-ma-
lignant pain, to identify patients who are likely to have a
neuropathic component to their pain [15]. It has been

 also been assessed for use in cancer pain [16,17]. The
assessment consists of two sections; a pain question-
naire and sensory testing. In the pain questionnaire,
subjects are asked five “yes/no” questions concerning
their pain. With the sensory testing, the subject is exam-
ined for allodynia and for altered pin-prick threshold.
Combining the scores for the questionnaire and the
sensory testing gives a maximum score of 24. A score
of �12 suggests that neuropathic mechanisms are likely
to be contributing to the patient’s pain whereas a score
of <12 suggests that neuropathic mechanisms are un-
likely to be contributing to the patient’s pain.
Quantitative Sensory Testing
QST is a form of psychophysical testing to define the
underlying mechanisms of pain and augments the trad-
itional neurological examination. Its use in the character-
ization and assessment of pain relies on what is known
about the plasticity of the nervous system [18]. QST has
been used most frequently in the assessment of neuro-
pathic pain for measuring sensory responses to defined
thermal and mechanical stimuli [19,20]. It has been
shown that abnormalities of some aspects of QST
(warm/cold stimuli) predict patients who are more likely
to respond to radiotherapy for the treatment of cancer
induced bone pain [21]. It is therefore of interest to ex-
plore if a paradigm exists in patients receiving radiother-
apy for MPM related pain. The techniques used in QST
testing for this study have been described previously
[21].
Statistics and Analysis
All questionnaires were completed by the patient in the
presence of the same clinician, who also undertook
QST, in order to reduce inter-observer variability.
Patient demographics
and pain
characteristics (SF-
MPQ, BPI) were summarized using proportions, means,
and standard deviations (SDs) or medians and inter-
quartile ranges (IQRs) as appropriate. BPI “average
pain” and “worst pain” scores were related to the BPI
interference scale using Spearman’s correlation. A fur-
ther analysis of the BPI interference scale was under-
taken
to
compare
those
patients
with,
and
those
without, neuropathic pain, using Mann–Whitney tests.
Results
Forty patients consented to the study, 37 of whom
completed the assessments. The characteristics of all
patients are shown in Table 1. The median age was
71.5 years (IQR 65-76) and median time from diagnosis
to study entry was approximately four months (IQR 2–
12).
All
patients
were
performance
status
0–2.
Epithelioid MPM was the most common histology, being
present in 21 (56.8%) patients. Fourteen patients had
completed platinum/pemetrexed based chemotherapy.
Eleven patients (28.9%) had metastatic disease at the
time of study entry.
Analgesic use is shown in Table 2. Strong opioids were
used by 32 patients (84.2%) whereas only three patients
(7.9%) were on weak opioids. Twenty-five patients
(65.8%) were on adjuvant analgesics with the same
number of patients on simple analgesics. Of those pa-
tients on adjuvant analgesics, 14 were on pregabalin,
eight on gabapentin, and three on amitriptyline. It is diffi-
cult to assess the impact that these analgesics had on
the pain but, given that all these patients still had pain
sufficient to require radiotherapy, it would imply that
these drugs were not adequately controlling the pain.
Pain Characteristics
The sensory component of the SF-MPQ is shown in
Figure 1. The words most commonly chosen to de-
scribe the pain were aching, tender, and sharp being
reported by 32 (86.5%), 29(78.4%), and 27(73%) of pa-
tients, respectively.
Figure 2 shows the individual components of the BPI.
The median (IQR) for average pain and worst pain was
4 (4–6) and 8 (6–8), respectively. General activity, normal
work, and enjoyment of life scored the highest on the
interference scores. Relationships appeared to be rela-
tively unaffected by pain in this group.
Figure 3 shows scatterplots of the mean interference
scores (MIS) measured against worst pain score (WPS)
and average pain score (APS) from the BPI. The
Spearman’s Correlation Coefficient for the MIS and the
WPS
was
0.567,
P < 0.001.
The
Spearman’s
Correlation Coefficient for MIS and APS was 0.556,
P < 0.001. This shows a moderate positive association
in worst and average pain scores with the mean interfer-
ence score of the BPI.
Lanss
Eleven patients, 31.4%, had a total LANSS �12 while
24 (68.6%) patients had a LANSS <12. An analysis was
performed to assess whether there was any association
among LANSS, BPI, and SF-MPQ.
The median total BPI for patients with a LANSS <12
was 52 (IQR 41.00 - 59.50) versus 69.50 (IQR 61.00 –
84.00)
for
patients
with
a
LANSS �12,
P ¼ 0.004.
Similarly, comparing the LANSS with the SF-MPQ, the
median SF-MPQ for those with a LANSS <12 was
10.00 (IQR 8.00 – 13.50) versus 15.00 (IQR 12.00 –
18.00) for patients with a LANSS �12, P ¼ 0.012. These
data show that patients with a high LANSS also have a
high
BPI
and
a
high
SF-MPQ
(see
Figure
4),
Spearman’s correlation coefficient 0.56 (P < 0.001).
Response to radiotherapy was assessed looking at
baseline LANSS and SF-MPQ. There was no evidence
that likelihood of response to radiotherapy is determined
by the LANSS or SF-MPQ, P > 0.05.

 A clinical diagnosis of neuropathic pain was made in 20
patients. Of the 11 patients with a positive LANSS
score, eight also had a clinical diagnosis of neuropathic
pain
(73%).
However,
11
of
24
patients
with
a
LANSS <12 also had a clinical diagnosis of neuropathic
pain (45.8%) suggesting that the LANSS may not be a
particularly effective screening tool in this patient group
given the high false negative rate. Furthermore, a clinical
diagnosis of neuropathic pain did not predict response
or lack of response to radiotherapy with six patients
with a clinical diagnosis of neuropathic pain responding
and eight patients without such a clinical diagnosis
responding.
QST Results
All QST parameters assessed in the hemithorax affected
by MPM were compared to the contralateral side.
These data are presented in Table 3. Abnormal sensa-
tion to brush stimuli was seen in n ¼ 13 (50%) of pa-
tients. Detection threshold was altered in n ¼ 29 (87.9%)
of patients. Pain threshold was abnormal in n ¼ 16
(78.8%) of patients. Sensation to cold stimuli was ab-
normal in n ¼ 24 (75%) of patients, and abnormal to the
warm stimuli in n ¼ 19 (59.4%) of patients. Pin-prick
sensation was abnormal in n ¼ 19 (63.4%). Finally, in
terms of wind up, this was abnormal in n ¼ 21 (70%) of
patients.
Further analyses were performed to ascertain whether
there was an association among specific QST charac-
teristics, namely pin prick, hot and cold sensation, and
the scores obtained in the BPI, LANSS, or SF-MPQ.
The median SF-MPQ in those with abnormal QST cool
sensation was 12 (IQR 9.5 – 16.5) compared with a me-
dian SF-MPQ of 6.5 (IQR 5.0 – 11.5) in those with nor-
mal cool sensation. This was a significant difference
between those two groups of patients (P ¼ 0.016).
There was no such relationship between SF-MPQ and
normal or abnormal hot sensation (P ¼ 0.697). There
was also no relationship between total BPI and any of
the three selected QST assessments. With regards to
the QST data and LANSS, all eight patients, in whom
pin-prick
sensation
was
assessed,
who
had
a
LANSS �12, had abnormal pin-prick sensation whereas
only nine of the 20 patients (45%) with a LANSS <12
had abnormal pin-prick sensation (P ¼ 0.010). Analysis
was also performed to investigate whether there were
any particular QST characteristics which would suggest
a higher likelihood of response to radiotherapy. No such
association was seen.
Discussion
Pain is a significant problem in MPM and patients
scored highly on all pain questionnaires. Pain also sig-
nificantly impacted on day-to-day function and high lev-
els of worst and average pain were associated with
functional interference.
Pain in MPM has been reported as having a strong
neuropathic component related to its local effects on
the neurovascular bundle [22]. It was of interest that in
the present study, only 20 patients (54%) had a clinical
diagnosis of neuropathic pain, and in such patients, it
would be reasonable to use appropriate neuropathic
agents. Pain response to radiotherapy did not appear to
be affected by whether there was a neuropathic elem-
ent to the pain with a similar proportion of patients re-
sponding to radiotherapy in both groups. Of the 20
patients who had a clinical diagnosis of neuropathic
pain, only eight had a positive LANSS. In addition, 11 of
the 24 patients with a negative LANSS had a clinical
diagnosis of neuropathic pain. Based on these data, it
would appear that the LANSS is not a particularly effect-
ive screening tool for neuropathic pain in MPM.

 This is the first study that characterizes pain in MPM;
therefore, we are unable to compare our findings with
other previous work. However, similar work has been
performed on cancer-induced bone pain (CIBP) [23].
The work on CIBP showed that WPS was more closely
correlated to MIS than APS. It is accepted that back-
ground pain in CIBP is easier to control than incident
pain, but in MPM related pain, it would appear that both
WPS and APS correlate with MIS suggesting that both
background pain and incident pain are problematic in
MPM patients. Therefore, the aim of analgesia should
be to target background and incident pain.
With regards to the SF-MPQ descriptors, the most com-
monly used words in this study were aching, tender,
and sharp. In previous work examining CIBP, the most
commonly used descriptors were dull, sore, hurting,
and heavy [23]. This would suggest that the character
of pain in MPM is different and that in part this may be
due to underlying its complex mechanism—nociceptive
and neuropathic in combination.
QST has never been studied in MPM patients; however,
QST has been studied in patients undergoing palliative
radiotherapy for cancer induced bone pain [21]. In

 CIBP, the main finding was that those patients who had
normalization of abnormal warm sensation had higher
improvements in pain scores [21]. This suggests that
patients who have alteration in certain sensory charac-
teristics are more likely to respond to radiotherapy. The
present study did not show that any QST parameters
predicted response to radiotherapy, despite marked
sensory abnormalities in the affected side with the ma-
jority of patients having altered pinprick, warm and cool
sensation, as well as altered detection threshold; how-
ever, the study was not powered to assess this.
It has been demonstrated that pain in MPM improves fol-
lowing radiotherapy in approximately 50% of patients [9].
While these findings are encouraging, it does mean that
some patients who are treated with radiotherapy do not
get an improvement in their pain. If biomarkers were
identified that predicted those patients who were more
likely to respond to radiotherapy, then this may allow
treatment to be stratified accordingly. The present study
does not identify any such factors however was not pow-
ered to do so. Future studies examining radiotherapy for
the treatment of pain in MPM should include biomarker
collection to allow any predictive factors to be identified.
Limitations
The small sample size is a clear limitation and thus lim-
ited inference can be made from the findings. The sam-
ple size was based on assessing response rates to
radiotherapy, as part of the primary study. All of the pre-
sent aims were exploratory and should be examined

 further in larger cohorts. Another limitation is that the
LANSS is a screening tool for neuropathic pain and is
not diagnostic, and again, limited inferences can be
drawn. However there is no inter-observer variability as
the same clinician undertook all assessments.
The lack of a comparator arm is a limitation of the study as
is the lack of temporal data. A comparator group would be
of interest; however, this group would have been challeng-
ing to identify. Again temporal information would have been
of interest but due to the attrition rate, these data would
have yielded limited information.
Conclusion
Pain is a common and severe problem in MPM, which
has a neuropathic component in some patients; however,
clearly its mechanism is mixed. Of note there were no
specific factors that predicted response, and indeed the
presence of neuropathic pain was not associated with
any difference in pain relief from radiotherapy compared
to relief in those patients whose pain lacked a neuropathic
component. This is perhaps not surprising as the role of
radiotherapy in the treatment of pain originating from pre-
dominantly neuropathic sources is not substantiated.
It is important to identify factors predicting response to
radiotherapy as the majority of patients who receive
radiotherapy for MPM are in the last months of life. The
identification of factors predicting response may enable
treatment
stratification.
Studies
assessing
this
are
awaited with interest.
