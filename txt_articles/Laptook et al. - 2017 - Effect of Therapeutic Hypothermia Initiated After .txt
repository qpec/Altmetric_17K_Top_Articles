 Abstract
IMPORTANCE—Hypothermia initiated at less than 6 hours after birth reduces death or disability 
for infants with hypoxic-ischemic encephalopathy at 36 weeks’ or later gestation. To our 
knowledge, hypothermia trials have not been performed in infants presenting after 6 hours.
OBJECTIVE—To estimate the probability that hypothermia initiated at 6 to 24 hours after birth 
reduces the risk of death or disability at 18 months among infants with hypoxic-ischemic 
encephalopathy.
DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS—A randomized clinical trial was conducted 
between April 2008 and June 2016 among infants at 36 weeks’ or later gestation with moderate or 
severe hypoxic-ischemic encephalopathy enrolled at 6 to 24 hours after birth. Twenty-one US 
Neonatal Research Network centers participated. Bayesian analyses were prespecified given the 
anticipated limited sample size.
INTERVENTIONS—Targeted esophageal temperature was used in 168 infants. Eighty-three 
hypothermic infants were maintained at 33.5°C (acceptable range, 33°C–34°C) for 96 hours and 
then rewarmed. Eighty-five noncooled infants were maintained at 37.0°C (acceptable range, 
36.5°C–37.3°C).
MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES—The composite of death or disability (moderate or 
severe) at 18 to 22 months adjusted for level of encephalopathy and age at randomization.
RESULTS—Hypothermic and noncooled infants were term (mean [SD], 39 [2] and 39 [1] weeks’ 
gestation, respectively), and 47 of 83 (57%) and 55 of 85 (65%) were male, respectively. Both 
groups were acidemic at birth, predominantly transferred to the treating center with moderate 
encephalopathy, and were randomized at a mean (SD) of 16 (5) and 15 (5) hours for hypothermic 
and noncooled groups, respectively. The primary outcome occurred in 19 of 78 hypothermic 
infants (24.4%) and 22 of 79 noncooled infants (27.9%) (absolute difference, 3.5%; 95% CI, −1% 
to 17%). Bayesian analysis using a neutral prior indicated a 76% posterior probability of reduced 
death or disability with hypothermia relative to the noncooled group (adjusted posterior risk ratio, 
0.86; 95% credible interval, 0.58–1.29). The probability that death or disability in cooled infants 
was at least 1%, 2%, or 3% less than noncooled infants was 71%, 64%, and 56%, respectively.
CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE—Among term infants with hypoxic-ischemic 
encephalopathy, hypothermia initiated at 6 to 24 hours after birth compared with noncooling 
resulted in a 76% probability of any reduction in death or disability, and a 64% probability of at 
least 2% less death or disability at 18 to 22 months. Hypothermia initiated at 6 to 24 hours after 
birth may have benefit but there is uncertainty in its effectiveness.
TRIAL REGISTRATION—clinicaltrials.gov Identifier: NCT00614744
Hypoxic-ischemic encephalopathy represents a subset of neonatal encephalopathy, occurring 
in approximately 1.5 per 1000 live births.1 It is an important etiology of neonatal mortality 
and serious or devastating lifelong cerebral palsy, neurosensory deficits, and cognitive 
impairments.2 Therapeutic hypothermia initiated within 6 hours after birth for moderate or 
severe hypoxic-ischemic encephalopathy reduced the composite outcome of death or 
disability at 18 months in multiple randomized clinical trials3–8 and improved outcomes at 6

 to 7 years.9,10 The American Academy of Pediatrics published a framework to ensure 
appropriate use of hypothermia.11
In all previous neonatal trials, hypothermia was initiated within 6 hours after birth,3–8 
reflecting a 6-hour therapeutic window for hypothermia after brain ischemia in fetal sheep.
12–14 However, only 5 fetal sheep were cooled at 8.5 hours after ischemia,14 and the results 
could not exclude the possibility of a longer therapeutic window. Initiating hypothermia 
before 6 hours after birth can be difficult if infants are born in remote communities and need 
to be transferred, or if encephalopathy evolves or is recognized after 6 hours. Initiation of 
hypothermia beyond 6 hours is currently without evidence of benefit.15 A definitive trial to 
determine benefit or harm cannot be conducted for this uncommon condition because even 
large research networks have an insufficient number of patients to achieve high statistical 
power in a reasonable time. To provide the most feasible estimate of treatment effect, a 
multicenter, randomized clinical trial was conducted over 8 years among infants with 
moderate or severe hypoxic-ischemic encephalopathy treated with hypothermia initiated at 
or after 6 hours but before 24 hours of age compared with noncooled infants. Bayesian 
analyses were performed to estimate the probability that hypothermia reduced the risk of 
death or disability at 18 months.
Methods
Participants
Trial enrollment occurred between April 2008 and July 2014 and follow-up was completed 
in June 2016 at 21 centers of the Eunice Kennedy Shriver National Institutes of Child Health 
and Human Development Neonatal Research Network located across the United States. The 
full trial protocol is available in Supplement 1. Each center received institutional review 
board approval and infants were enrolled after written informed parental consent was 
obtained. Newborns with gestational age 36 weeks or later and postnatal age 6 to 24 hours 
were screened for eligibility if they were admitted to a participating neonatal intensive care 
unit with a diagnosis of encephalopathy, perinatal asphyxia, or neurological depression. 
Enrollment until 24 hours of age was based on the variability in the manifestations of 
newborn encephalopathy,16 ongoing injurious processes in the hours to days after hypoxia-
ischemia,17 benefit from hypothermia initiated at 12 hours after ischemia in a preclinical 
study,18 and the uncertainty in extrapolating from animal to human newborns.
Inclusion criteria were identical to the prior Neonatal Research Network hypothermia trial4 
except for postnatal age. Infants who fulfilled biochemical or clinical criteria and were 
determined to have seizures or moderate or severe encephalopathy on examination by 
certified examiners were eligible.4 Infants without moderate or severe encephalopathy by 
examination but with clinical seizures were classified as having moderate encephalopathy. 
Exclusion criteria included a core temperature of less than 34°C for more than 1 hour, 
known anomaly, chromosomal aberration, birth weight less than 1800 g, in extremis 
condition, and parental or attending physician refusal. Race/ethnicity was obtained by 
maternal report using fixed categories to ensure group comparability along with other 
demographic variables.

 Randomization
Infants were stratified by postnatal age (≤12 hours or >12 hours) and stage of 
encephalopathy (moderate or severe), and they were randomly assigned by telephone by the 
data center to hypothermia or noncooling using a computer-generated permutated block 
algorithm with block size of 2 and 4 with a 1:1 ratio.
Intervention
Before randomization, temperature control was per center practices. The hypothermia group 
underwent whole-body cooling similar to the Neonatal Research Network hypothermia 
trial4,19 to maintain esophageal temperature at 33.5°C (acceptable range, 33.0°C–34.0°C) 
using a Hyper-Hypothermia Blanketrol system (Cincinnati Sub-Zero). The duration of 
hypothermia was lengthened from 72 hours4 to 96 hours based on preclinical data before 
2008 that a longer duration of hypothermia was needed to achieve neuroprotection with 
increasing delays between hypoxia-ischemia and initiation of cooling.18,20 At 96 hours, 
rewarming was conducted at 0.5°C per hour using the Blanketrol system and completed 
using a radiant warmer to maintain esophageal temperature of 37.0°C over 5 hours. 
Temperatures were recorded every 15 minutes during the first 3 hours of cooling, every hour 
until 12 hours, and at 4-hour intervals through the remainder of cooling and rewarming. The 
noncooled group was treated with an esophageal temperature probe and temperatures 
maintained at 37.0°C (acceptable range, 36.5°C–37.3°C). Infants were cared for on radiant 
warmers and the control set point for the skin temperature was adjusted to achieve the 
desired esophageal temperature. An algorithm was used to correct hyperthermia by ensuring 
appropriate thermal care if the esophageal temperature exceeded 37.3°C, and a tepid bath 
and/or cooling blanket if the temperature exceeded 37.5°C. Temperatures were recorded 
every 4 hours in the noncooled group. At 108 hours, esophageal temperature probes of both 
groups were removed and temperature control was resumed per local practice.
Outcomes
The primary outcome was death or disability, either moderate or severe, at 18 to 22 months 
of age. Certified examiners trained to reliability21 and masked to treatment assignment 
conducted a neurological examination and psychometric testing, assessed growth, and 
reviewed vision and hearing with the family. The Bayley Scales of Infant Development III 
were used to obtain cognitive, language, and motor scores (reported mean [SD] score, 100 
[15]; range, 55–145).22 The Gross Motor Function Classification Score (GMFCS; range, 0 
[normal] to 5 [worst]) was used to classify motor findings.23 Severe disability was defined as 
any of the following: a cognitive score less than 70, a GMFCS level of 3 to 5, and blindness 
or hearing impairment with inability to follow commands despite amplification. Moderate 
disability was defined as a cognitive score between 70 and 84 and any of the following: a 
GMFCS level of 2, an active seizure disorder (antiepileptic drugs in use), or a hearing deficit 
with the ability to follow commands after amplification.4 Infants who did not meet the 
primary outcome were categorized as either mild disability or normal. Mild disability was 
defined by a cognitive score of 70 to 84 alone or a cognitive score of 85 or greater, and any 
of the following: a GMFCS level of 1 or 2, a seizure disorder (without medication), or a 
hearing deficit with the ability to follow commands without amplification.

 Prespecified secondary outcomes were the frequency of death alone, moderate-severe 
disability alone, disability (severe, moderate, and mild), disability based on level of 
encephalopathy, seizures (with or without electroencephalograms), do not resuscitate order 
(DNR), DNR and support withdrawn, DNR and survival or death, and nonbrain organ 
dysfunction. The latter 2 are not reported. Outcomes not pre-specified were adverse events, 
in-hospital organ system morbidities, components of disability, normal infants (cognitive 
score of ≥85, a normal GMFCS level, no neurosensory deficits, and no seizures), and growth 
parameters at follow-up.
Sample Size and Statistical Analyses
The effect size was expected to be smaller than the prior Neonatal Research Network 
hypothermia trial (risk ratio [RR], 0.72; 95% CI, 0.54–0.95).4 A sample size of 168 was 
predefined and represented the largest sample that could be attained in a feasible time 
interval (6-year enrollment). A Bayesian analysis was prespecified to estimate the 
probability of treatment benefit based on recommendations for trials of rare conditions with 
limited sample size and power in frequentist analyses to identify conclusive treatment 
effects.24
In Bayesian analyses, the probability of treatment effect (posterior probability) is estimated 
after the trial and incorporates the prior probability estimated from the best data from 
previous studies (clinical trials or pilot trials).25 Judgment of the prior probability may vary 
and be neutral, enthusiastic, or skeptical. Therefore, analyses were performed using 3 
different prior probabilities: (1) a neutral prior, assuming no treatment effect (RR, 1.0); (2) 
an enthusiastic prior, assuming a 28% reduction in the risk of death or disability as in the 
earlier Neonatal Research Network trial4 (RR, 0.72); and (3) a skeptical prior, assuming a 
10% increase in the risk of death or disability (RR, 1.10). Whether neutral, enthusiastic, or 
skeptical, assessments of prior probability involve uncertainty about the minimum and 
maximum likely treatment effects. To reflect this uncertainty in each analysis, a probability 
distribution for the treatment effect with the 95% credible intervals that ranged from half to 
twice the assumed RR (SD, 0.35 in the log scale) was used. For example, the probability 
distribution for the neutral prior was centered at an RR of 1.0 (mean of 0 in the log scale) 
with a 50% prior probability of a better outcome, a 50% prior probability of a worse 
outcome, and a 95% credible interval for the RR of 0.5 to 2.0 (eAppendix in Supplement 2). 
The RR of 0.5 to 2.0 includes treatment effects for major clinical outcomes of the size 
observed in almost all large clinical trials.26 For adequately powered trials, differences 
between neutral, enthusiastic, and skeptical priors have almost no effect on the posterior 
probability. However, for smaller trials, Bayesian analyses allow assessment of how much 
the estimated probability of a treatment effect is affected by differing assessments of the 
prior evidence.
All analyses followed the intention-to-treat principle. A binomial model was used with a log 
link to estimate the posterior RR for different binary outcomes for the hypothermia group 
compared with the noncooled group. The model to obtain the adjusted RR (aRR) included 3 
main effects: treatment (hypothermia or noncooling), age at time of randomization (≤12 
hours or >12 hours), and level of encephalopathy (moderate or severe). Center was not

 included because models did not converge with center as a covariate. The original analysis 
plan specified a logistic model. This represented an oversight as the intent was to present 
adjusted relative risks to quantify the treatment effect. The decision to use a log binomial 
model was made prior to the derivation of the primary outcome and all analyses.
Interactions of treatment with age at enrollment, level of encephalopathy at randomization, 
and sex on the primary outcome were assessed with a log-linear model. Bayesian analyses 
were used to determine probabilities for the absolute risk difference (binomial model) and 
adjusted cognitive scores (linear regression). P values from parallel frequentist analyses are 
provided for outcomes not pre-specified, using 2-sided χ2, Fisher exact, Wilcoxon, and t 
tests; 1-sided t tests were used for absolute differences. A P < .05 was considered significant 
and was not adjusted for multiple comparisons. Statistical software for Bayesian analysis 
was JAGS version 4.6 and OpenBUGS version 3.2.3., and for frequentist analysis was SAS 
version 9.3 (SAS Institute). The data safety monitoring committee reviewed safety after 
every 20 infants and effectiveness at 33%, 50%, and 75% of outcome accrual.
Results
There were 168 participants and 83 were randomly assigned to hypothermia and 85 to 
noncooling (Figure 1). Hypothermic and noncooled infants were term (mean [SD], 39 [2] 
and 39 [1] weeks’ gestation, respectively), and 47 of 83 (57%) and 55 of 85 (65%) were 
male, respectively. Emergency cesarean delivery was performed for 99 of 168 infants (59%), 
of whom 146 (87%) were transferred to the treating center (Table 1). At birth, intubation 
was performed in 92 of 168 infants (55%) and chest compressions were performed in 44 of 
168 infants (26%). Hypothermic and noncooled infants were randomized at a mean (SD) of 
16 (5) and 15 (5) hours, respectively. Enrollment beyond 12 hours after birth occurred in 114 
of 168 infants (68%) and moderate encephalopathy was found in 151 of 168 infants (90%). 
Ten infants in each group were enrolled based on clinical seizures without moderate or 
severe encephalopathy. Infants with incomplete or no follow-up (n = 11) were similar to 
those with a known outcome (eTable 1 in Supplement 2).
Following hypothermia induction, mean (SD) esophageal temperature was maintained at 
33.3 (0.3)°C between 3 and 96 hours (eFigure in Supplement 2). The mean (SD) esophageal 
temperature for the noncooled group during the intervention was 36.8 (0.5)°C. In the 
noncooled group, the median number of esophageal temperatures per infant below 36.5°C 
was 1 (interquartile range [IQR], 0–3) and the mean of these values was 36.2°C (IQR, 
35.9°C–36.4°C). The median number of esophageal temperatures per infant greater than 
37.3°C was 1 (IQR, 0–4) and the mean of these values was 37.5°C (IQR, 37.4°C–37.7°C). 
Interventions to reduce elevated temperature were performed in 27 of 85 infants (32%) in the 
noncooled group; 24 infants (28%) received a tepid bath and 7 infants (8%) were treated 
with a cooling blanket.
During the intervention and rewarming, unmasked observers recorded 13 and 6 adverse 
events in the hypothermia and noncooled groups, respectively (Table 2). One infant 
(hypothermia) developed subcutaneous fat necrosis and 1 infant (noncooled) developed 
diabetes insipidus, both remote from the intervention. There were no group differences in

 organ system morbidities or need for extracorporeal membrane oxygenation. A blood 
glucose concentration greater than 150 mg/dL occurred more frequently in the hypothermia 
than the noncooled group (to convert glucose to millimoles per liter, multiply by 0.0555).
Complete follow-up at a mean (SD) of 21 (3) months was achieved among 69 of 74 (93%) 
and 72 of 78 (92%) hypothermia and noncooled survivors to discharge, respectively. There 
were 9 deaths in each group. There were minimal missing data for the components of 
disability among survivors, which did not prevent assignment of a primary outcome except 
for 2 infants with incomplete follow-up evaluations (Figure 1). Death or disability (moderate 
or severe) at follow-up was known for 157 infants (93.5%) and occurred in 19 of 78 (24.4%) 
of the hypothermia group and 22 of 79 (27.9%) of the noncooled group (absolute difference, 
3.5%; 95% CI, −1% to 17%; Table 3). Bayesian analysis using a neutral prior indicated a 
76% posterior probability of reduced death or disability with a posterior aRR of 0.86 (95% 
credible interval, 0.58–1.29) (Figure 2). The corresponding frequentist aRR was 0.81 (95% 
CI, 0.44–1.51). Further, 73% and 68% probabilities were identified for reduction in death 
and in moderate-severe disability, respectively, under the neutral prior. Expressed as an 
absolute risk difference, the posterior probability that death or disability for hypothermia 
using a neutral prior was at least 1%, 2%, or 3% less compared with noncooled treatment 
was 71%, 64%, and 56%, respectively. A 2% absolute risk difference was associated with a 
3.2-times (64%/20%) higher probability of reduced compared with increased death or 
disability among hypothermia relative to noncooled infants, assuming a range of risk 
differences viewed as equivalent (Figure 2). Using an enthusiastic prior, the posterior 
probability that death or disability was at least 1%, 2%, or 3% less compared with noncooled 
increased to 86%, 80%, and 74%, respectively. Death or moderate-severe disability did not 
differ by age at randomization: 6 of 25 infants (24.0%) and 7 of 26 infants (26.9%) when 
randomized at 12 hours or less, and 13 of 53 infants (24.5%) and 15 of 53 infants (28.3%) 
when randomized between 12 and 24 hours in the hypothermia and noncooled groups, 
respectively. There were no interactions between treatment and age at randomization, level 
of encephalopathy, or sex for the primary outcome (Bayesian probability of an interaction, 
46%, 38%, and 22%, respectively).
Other prespecified and exploratory outcomes did not differ between groups (eTable 2 in 
Supplement 2). Although Bayley cognitive scores did not differ, they contributed to the 
extent of disability within each group; a post-hoc Bayesian analysis (neutral prior) indicated 
a 97% probability of higher scores among hypothermia infants. A post-hoc aRR for survival 
of infants with a normal outcome was 0.98 (95% credible intervals, 0.76–1.26; neutral 
prior).
Discussion
Among term infants with hypoxic-ischemic encephalopathy, hypothermia initiated at 6 to 24 
hours after birth resulted in a 76% probability of any reduction in death or disability using a 
Bayesian analysis with a neutral prior. The probability that death or disability was at least 
2% less in hypothermia compared with noncooled infants was 64%. Enrolled infants met 
criteria for hypothermia of the earlier Neonatal Research Network trial.4 Death or disability

 (moderate or severe) was known for 93.5% of enrollees and follow-up assessments were 
performed by examiners blinded to the intervention.
It can be difficult to study therapies for rare diseases or uncommon features of previously 
studied disease processes. Extrapolation from animal studies has limitations.27 The 
therapeutic window during which hypothermia may modify hypoxic-ischemic brain injury 
may differ between preclinical studies and human newborns owing to species maturation, 
methods to induce hypoxia-ischemia, and outcomes studied. Randomized clinical trials are 
unlikely to have sufficient power to identify clinically important treatment effects in 
traditional frequentist analysis. This is especially pertinent to a trial of hypothermia initiated 
after 6 hours of age as it addresses a small subset of infants with moderate-severe 
encephalopathy. Furthermore, based on preclinical studies,12–14 hypothermia started after 6 
hours was anticipated to provide less neuroprotection than hypothermia started before 6 
hours, making it even less feasible to achieve high power even in the Neonatal Research 
Network, with 21 centers serving large delivery cohorts and referral bases throughout the 
United States. However, the high rates of potentially catastrophic outcomes associated with 
hypoxic-ischemic encephalopathy, and reports of initiating hypothermia after 6 hours in a 
subset of infants with moderate-severe encephalopathy without any systematic study, 
provided justification to undertake this trial.
With the sample size studied, traditional frequentist analysis identified no significant 
difference for death or disability between the hypothermic and noncooled groups. A 
frequentist analysis of an underpowered trial would provide little help for clinicians treating 
infants with encephalopathy who present beyond 6 hours. However, frequentist analyses do 
not allow calculation of the probability of a specified benefit while Bayesian methods allow 
for direct assessment of the probability of treatment effect based on the trial results.24,25,28 A 
series of absolute risk differences in death or disability were provided to assess effect size. 
An absolute risk reduction of 1% or 2% in death or moderate-severe disability may be 
viewed as clinically important given the seriousness of the outcome. Perinatal and adult 
therapies have been recommended at a similar low absolute risk reduction for major adverse 
outcomes. A risk reduction of 1.6% for cerebral palsy has been reported among preterm 
newborns whose mothers were treated with magnesium sulfate,29 a treatment now widely 
used in obstetrics.30 Statins have been recommended in adults with a cardiovascular disease 
risk of 10% but without cardiovascular disease31 based on absolute risk reductions of 0.4% 
and 1.4% for all-cause and composite cardiovascular mortality, respectively.32
The reduction in death or disability for hypothermic compared with noncooled infants is 
suggestive but not conclusive. No evidence of commensurate harm was found. Adverse 
events, prespecified and those not prespecified, occurred in more hypothermic than 
noncooled infants but did not differ by frequentist analysis. The number of deaths per group 
was the same, but the Bayesian analysis indicated the aRR favored hypothermia and the 
posterior probability of reduced death was 73% under a neutral prior. A decision to use 
hypothermia at 6 to 24 hours will need to consider the probability of benefit, the frequency 
of adverse events, and the availability of evidence-based alternative treatments.

 In all neonatal trials, hypothermia initiated at less than 6 hours reduced death or disability,33 
and therefore a prior based on an RR between 1.0 (no benefit) and 0.72 (the benefit 
identified in the previous Neonatal Research Network hypothermia trial4) might be 
considered appropriate. If so, the estimated probabilities for any reduction or a greater than 
1% or greater than 2% absolute reduction in death or disability would be somewhat higher 
and intermediate between the estimates using a neutral prior and those using an enthusiastic 
prior. Given these considerations, estimated probabilities based on a neutral prior could be 
considered conservative. Since the initiation of this trial, there is little new information on 
late hypothermia treatment to provide an estimate of treatment effect. A trial from China 
randomized 93 newborns within 10 hours of birth to hypothermia or normothermia; only 9 
infants received hypothermia between 6 and 10 hours.34 Single-center and registry data 
reported initiation of hypothermia after 6 hours but did not provide treatment effect.15,35
Hypoxic-ischemic encephalopathy resulting in moderate or severe disability is a devastating 
outcome. The results of this trial should not change the priority of early identification of 
infants with hypoxic-ischemic encephalopathy and initiation of hypothermia at less than 6 
hours. This trial provides an approach to estimate the treatment effect for uncommon 
diseases in the largest feasible clinical trial and avoid the biases inherent in observational 
studies.
Limitations
This study has several limitations. During this trial, the Neonatal Research Network initiated 
the Optimizing Cooling trial to study longer (120 hours) or deeper (32°C) cooling initiated 
at less than 6 hours of age.36,37 The Optimizing Cooling trial was stopped early partly owing 
to safety concerns for increased in-hospital mortality among infants cooled for 120 rather 
than 72 hours. Whether the current trial results would differ if the intervention was shortened 
to 72 hours cannot be answered. Elevated esophageal temperature occurred among 
noncooled infants and such temperatures have been associated with a greater risk of death or 
disability in prior trials.38–40 The algorithm used in noncooled infants largely mitigated the 
extent and duration of esophageal temperatures greater than 37.3°C compared with the 
earlier Neonatal Research Network hypothermia trial.4 Also, the reason for presentation at 
or beyond 6 hours was not always known.
Conclusions
Among term infants with hypoxic-ischemic encephalopathy, hypothermia initiated at 6 to 24 
hours after birth compared with noncooling resulted in a 76% probability of any reduction in 
death or disability, and a 64% probability of at least 2% less death or disability at 18 to 22 
months. Hypothermia initiated at 6 to 24 hours after birth may have benefit but there is 
uncertainty in its effectiveness.

disability at 18 months among term newborns with hypoxic-ischemic encephalopathy?
Findings
In this Bayesian analysis of a randomized clinical trial of 168 newborns with hypoxic-
ischemic encephalopathy, treatment with hypothermia initiated at 6 to 24 hours after birth 
compared with noncooling resulted in a 76% probability of any reduced death or 
disability, and a 64% probability of at least 2% less death or disability at 18 to 22 months.
Meaning
Hypothermia treatment initiated at 6 to 24 hours for newborns with hypoxic-ischemic 
encephalopathy may reduce death or disability but there is uncertainty in its effectiveness.

 Figure 2. Posterior Probability of Death or Disability With Hypothermia Initiated at 6 to 24 
Hours After Birth vs Noncooling
A, The probability density describes the frequency distribution of observed values and is 
unit-less. The curves are scaled so that the total area under the curve is 1, and the area 
between any 2 values on the x-axis equals the probability of observing a value in that range. 
The blue line plots a neutral prior distribution centered at a risk ratio of 1.0 and indicates an 
equal number of infants would be expected to benefit by either temperature management 
group, hypothermia or noncooled. The posterior probability of treatment effect is derived by 
combining the prior distribution with the trial results. The distribution is shifted to the left of 
a risk ratio of 1.0 with a point estimate of 0.86. The area under the curve that is less than a 
risk ratio of 1.0 (light blue) represents the posterior probability of any reduction in death or 
disability (76% for this trial). The area under the curve that is greater than a risk ratio of 1.0 
(dark blue) represents the posterior probability of an increase in death or disability (24% for 
this trial). B, The light blue portion indicates a 64% probability that death or disability in 
infants treated with hypothermia is at least 2% less than noncooled infants (benefit). The 
pale blue area (near zero) is an arbitrary zone of indifference to illustrate the probability of 
risk differences where hypothermia and noncooling may be viewed as equivalent. The dark 
blue indicates the probability of death or disability among infants treated with hypothermia 
is higher than for noncooled infants (harm). In this example, a 2% absolute risk difference

 was associated with a 3.2-times (64%/20%) higher probability of reduced compared with 
increased death or disability risk among hypothermia relative to noncooled infants.

aReference for the aRR is the noncooled group and the aRR is adjusted for level of encephalopathy (moderate, severe) and age at randomization (≤12 h, >12 h). Variables in the adjusted analyses were 
outcome, treatment, level of encephalopathy at randomization, and age at randomization.
bCauses of death in the hypothermia group were asphyxia brain injury (n = 5), multiorgan failure (n = 1), persistent pulmonary hypertension (n = 1), respiratory failure associated with intractable seizures (n 
= 1), and intracranial hemorrhage (n = 1). Causes of death in the noncooled group were asphyxia brain injury (n = 5), multiorgan failure (n = 1), and meconium aspiration syndrome (n = 1), and 2 were 
without an assigned cause (after discharge).
cDisability categories were defined as follows: severe included any of the following: a cognitive score less than 70, a Gross Motor Function Classification Score (GMFCS) level of 3 to 5, or blindness or 
hearing impairment with inability to follow commands despite amplification; moderate included a cognitive score between 70 and 84 and any of the following: a GMFCS level of 2, an active seizure 
disorder (antiepileptic drugs in use), or a hearing deficit with the ability to follow commands after amplification; and mild included a cognitive score between 70 and 84 or a cognitive score of 85 or greater 
with any of the following: a GMFCS level of 1 or 2, seizure disorder (without medication), or a hearing deficit with the ability to follow commands without amplification.
dAnalyses could not be performed with 1 infant in each group.
