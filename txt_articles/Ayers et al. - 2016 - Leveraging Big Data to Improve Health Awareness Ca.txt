Abstract
Background: Awareness campaigns are ubiquitous, but little is known about their potential effectiveness because traditional
evaluations are often unfeasible. For 40 years, the “Great American Smokeout” (GASO) has encouraged media coverage and
popular engagement with smoking cessation on the third Thursday of November as the nation’s longest running awareness
campaign.
Objective: We proposed a novel evaluation framework for assessing awareness campaigns using the GASO as a case study by
observing cessation-related news reports and Twitter postings, and cessation-related help seeking via Google, Wikipedia, and
government-sponsored quitlines.
Methods: Time trends (2009-2014) were analyzed using a quasi-experimental design to isolate spikes during the GASO by
comparing observed outcomes on the GASO day with the simulated counterfactual had the GASO not occurred.
Results: Cessation-related news typically increased by 61% (95% CI 35-87) and tweets by 13% (95% CI −21 to 48) during the
GASO compared with what was expected had the GASO not occurred. Cessation-related Google searches increased by 25%
(95% CI 10-40), Wikipedia page visits by 22% (95% CI −26 to 67), and quitline calls by 42% (95% CI 19-64). Cessation-related
news media positively coincided with cessation tweets, Internet searches, and Wikipedia visits; for example, a 50% increase in
news for any year predicted a 28% (95% CI −2 to 59) increase in tweets for the same year. Increases on the day of the GASO
rivaled about two-thirds of a typical New Year’s Day—the day that is assumed to see the greatest increases in cessation-related
activity. In practical terms, there were about 61,000 more instances of help seeking on Google, Wikipedia, or quitlines on GASO
each year than would normally be expected.
Conclusions: These findings provide actionable intelligence to improve the GASO and model how to rapidly, cost-effectively,
and efficiently evaluate hundreds of awareness campaigns, nearly all for the first time.

 Introduction
Public health awareness campaigns are annual events designed
to foster knowledge of health risks and engagement during
specific days, weeks, or months. The number of public
awareness campaigns has substantially risen, with one catalogue
listing more than 200 ongoing domestic campaigns [1].
The ubiquity of awareness campaigns likely stems from the
ease of their implementation. While most mass media campaigns
require substantial advertising budgets [2], awareness campaigns
require minimal assets. For example, many awareness campaigns
are accomplished by issuing a press release that is freely carried
across news media outlets and potentially on social media.
The ease of implementing awareness campaigns, however,
sharply contrasts with the pragmatic and methodological barriers
that have made assessing their potential effectiveness unfeasible.
As an example, a recent systematic review found that only 5 of
79 published reports on awareness campaigns were evaluation
studies [3]. One reason for the absence of evaluations is that
the driving incentive for awareness campaigns is to minimize
operational expenses, which can make traditional evaluations
too costly [4]. In addition, because most awareness campaigns
occur on a single day, traditional evaluations may not be
possible, such as collecting survey responses for a pre-post
analysis. Regardless, traditional modalities alone cannot
altogether inform how awareness campaigns are expected to
work, as they often cannot assess how campaign messages are
diffused via news media, are shared on social media, or how
the population engages with these messages (such as seeking
out information online). Alternative evaluation approaches that
rely on metrics assessing both media and popular reactions to
media are needed to ensure that awareness campaigns’ important
public health messages are scientifically supported.
Big data may fill the knowledge gap for evaluating health
awareness campaigns. It has to be noted that other public health
surveillance gaps are already being filled by big data’s
inexpensive, fine-grained, and real-time capabilities, especially
in cases where little or no traditional data exist [5-7]. However,
to date, big data have rarely been applied to studying health
communication campaigns [8-14], or even health communication
research more broadly [15-18]. The few studies harnessing big
data have often relied on a single outcome, such as Internet
search queries, and loosely interpreted these outcomes in the
absence of any framework for campaign evaluations. We take
a step forward by proposing a simple and actionable approach
to monitoring trends in the most frequently mentioned kinds of
big data (news media, social media, and help seeking on Google,
Wikipedia, and telephone counseling services). Our analyses
are presented in the context of a novel evaluation framework
that takes into account how awareness campaigns are expected
to diffuse [3], and thus provide actionable intelligence for
program managers at each stage of campaign diffusion from
news media at the population level to individual help seeking
regarding campaign outcomes.
In this report, we specifically developed a framework to evaluate
the American Cancer Society’s “Great American Smokeout”
(GASO). This past year (2015) marked the 40th commemoration
of the GASO, held annually on the third Thursday of November,
making it the world’s longest running health awareness
campaign. The GASO aims to generate and diffuse media
encouraging individuals to go smoke-free for a day, and to
consider quitting for good. Although activities promoting the
GASO have varied over time, GASO is currently promoted by
scheduling interviews with selected news outlets; producing
media fact sheets with information about tobacco harms and
quitting tips; disseminating toolkits with infographics, email
templates, and event ideas such as quitting competitions for
partnering organizations or businesses to celebrate the GASO;
and more recently, by posting similar messages on social media.
Our aim was to develop a method for studying how a message
diffuses through news and social media and ultimately leads to
engagement via information seeking with the core message.
Our novel evaluation framework was based on the key intended
aims of the GASO and available big data sources. First, we
examined the extent to which the GASO’s cessation-related
messages for 2009-2014 were carried in news media; second,
how similar messages were shared on Twitter; and third, the
extent to which these messages were associated with help
seeking via Internet searches for quitting smoking, information
retrieval on Wikipedia’s cessation page, and calling
state-sponsored quitlines, all informed by an analysis of 2191
days of data. We hypothesized that trends would spike on the
day of the GASO. Moreover, the interrelationships between
these data (eg, news media’s relationship with social media)
were explored, under the assumption that news media begets
social media, progressing through individual help-seeking
actions for cessation.
Methods
Data were compiled into a daily time series for the period
between January 1, 2009, and December 31, 2014. Each data
source was purposively selected to provide insights on a
different level of analysis or specificity. For example, news
media trends indicate how well GASO’s message of quitting
smoking is disseminated, whereas search query trends indicate
that the searcher is thinking about cessation or that the searcher
is taking some action toward investigating behavior change.
Table 1 presents the diverse data sources, as briefly described
in the following section.
Cessation-related news media coverage that mentioned “quit”
or “stop” and “smoking” was retrieved from News Library, a
comprehensive repository of US newspaper articles, including
online and print content. This included stories with titles such
as “The last cigarette: Nine ex-smokers who quit the habit for
good,” “Quit smoking, one of the most important ways to
improve health,” and “Quitting smoking reduces heart risk faster
than previously thought.” Stories mentioning cessation were
normalized relative to all news stories to adjust for potential
biases arising from changes in media volume over time.
Social media shares about cessation were obtained from the
public Twitter application programming interface. This did not
include any data that had been marked as “private” by the author
or any direct messages. Initially, the data were derived from 2
feeds, each a random sample of 10% of all tweets. We retained

 600,000 tweets mentioning “quit” or “stop” and “smoking”
(including variations on “quit” like “quitting”) while not
mentioning “fire,” “marijuana,” “mj,” “pot,” “pott,” or “weed.”
Subsequently, we randomly selected 10,000 of these tweets and
a single reader labeled them as to whether the tweeter was indeed
tweeting about smoking cessation. We then trained an automated
classifier on that data to mimic human coding, obtaining about
90% precision and 70% recall. The resulting classifier was ran
on all 600,000 tweets to obtain the analyzed trend. This included
tweets such as “tryn quit smoking waiste to much money” (sic)
or “quit smoking and start exercising because healthy body
healthy mind” (sic). Tweets were measured in raw volume, but
trending (increases in tweets over time) was corrected for in the
analysis as detailed in the following section.
Internet searches for cessation information were obtained from
Google Trends, a public archive of Google search queries.
Queries that included “quit” or “stop” and “smoking” (such as
“quit smoking methods,” “help stop smoking,” or “quit
smoking”) after excluding searches that also included “fire,”
“marijuana,” “mj,” “pot,” “pott,” or “weed,” were monitored
relative to all queries each day, reported as a relative search
volume (RSV), where RSV=100 is the day with the highest
search proportion, and RSV=50 is a day with 50% of that highest
proportion.

Quitline calls
Wikipedia visits to the primary English language “smoking
cessation” entry were also counted. Wikipedia was selected
because it is typically the first or second result on Internet search
engines. Web page views for this Wikipedia page were
normalized by dividing by all Wikipedia English language page
views reported per 1,000,000 each day.
Quitline call records were obtained from aggregating daily call
logs for 28 states whose quitline service is provided by Alere
Wellbeing, Inc. Demographic details for each call are recorded
(eg, language of the call), but here we focused on all
English-language calls. The raw call counts were used because
there was no suitable denominator for normalization; however,
trending (and other problems normalization typically resolves)
was corrected for in the analysis as detailed in the following
section.
Our statistical approach was quasi-experimental, focusing on
deriving a single treatment effect for any potential spike
proximal to the GASO in the time series for each of the 5 data
sources [18,23]. The treatment period was the day of the GASO
and the reference was based on the empirically derived
counterfactual had the GASO not occurred. For the overall
estimate we used autoregressive integrated moving average
(ARIMA) models that included all the days in each time series
with a regression coefficient for the days of GASO fit to
maximize Akaike information criterion using the algorithm
outlined by Hyndman and Khandakar [24]. For the individual
years, we fit the same ARIMA models to the year prior to each
GASO event. The counterfactual value for the GASO was
imputed based on this model for each of the 5 analyzed time
series. The ratio of the observed values (treatment) and derived
values from the ARIMAs (counterfactual) was computed,
thereby making the effect estimates comparable across each
time series [eg, (Treatment − Counterfactual)/Counterfactual].
These models are robust to the most well-known biases. For
instance, the models are adjusted for seasonal [25] and
circaseptan (day of the week) [26,27] periodicities, and trending
in the data, such as declines in smoking-cessation Internet search
queries as a proportion of all queries due to shrinking smoking
populations or how cessation tweets may be growing as

 Twitter’s user base grows. Confidence bounds (alpha=.05)
around these estimates were estimated using 10,000 random
draws from the multivariate normal sampling distribution with
mean equal to the maximum-likelihood point estimates, and
variance equal to the variance-covariance matrix [28].
To examine how increases in each time series were related to
increases in media, we fit a linear model with the percent
increases on GASO for media as the predictor and the percent
increases for tweets, search, Wikipedia, and quitline calls as the
outcome. Coefficients of these models were used to estimate
the percent increase in outcome for a given increase in media.
Confidence intervals were calculated analogously to those above.
Last, we replicated the aforementioned models focusing on
estimating treatment effects for New Year’s Day, which
typically sees the greatest spike in cessation-related activity.
These estimates were used as a baseline to judge the practical
impacts of the GASO relative to New Year’s Day (eg, ΔNYD
divided by ΔGASO).
Results
Three patterns were observed from visual inspection of the time
series across outcomes (Figure 1). There was substantial
variability across outcomes in the size of the spikes (if any)
around the GASO. For example, the GASO concurred with
large spikes in cessation-related news media in 2009 but it was
not replicated in tweets. There was substantial year-to-year
variability within outcomes in the size of the spikes around the
GASO. For example, news media coverage of cessation
appeared to be following a downward trend with potential spikes
appearing smaller later in the study period. Last, it appeared
that the timing of the GASO closely preceded or occurred during
lows in many of the outcomes. For example, Google searches
were at their annual low around the holiday season, just days
after the GASO.
Statistical analysis indicated that across all years, smoking
cessation news stories were 61% (95% CI 35-87) higher than
would be expected if the GASO did not occur. The largest
increases occurred earlier in the analyzed period and the smallest
in 2013 (Figure 2). Tweets were 13% (95% CI −21 to 48) higher
than would be expected, although these differences were also
decreasing over the study period, ranging from an increase of
48% (95% CI 9-131) in 2011 to a nonsignificant 3% decrease
(95% CI −478 to 47) in 2013. Analyses of the year-by-year
relationship between news and social media coverage indicated
that a 50% increase in news media was associated with an
increase in tweets (28%; 95% CI −2 to 59; P<.06).
Google searches for cessation information were 25% higher
(95% CI 10-40) across all years, with a peak increase of 52%
(95% CI 26-92) in 2011, when news media and Twitter interest
also peaked. Wikipedia views increased by 22% (95% CI −26
to 67) across all years but the increase was not statistically
significant overall or for any one year. Call volume to quitlines
increased by 42% (95% CI 19-64) across all years, with the
largest increases in 2011 (76%; 95% CI 12-308), 2013 (110%;
95% CI 32-412), and 2014 (92; 95% CI 24-322). In absolute
terms over the entire 5 years, this amounts to about 42,600 more
Google queries, 4600 more Wikipedia visits, and 13,400 more
quitline calls than would be expected had the GASO not
occurred.
Increased cessation-related news coverage was positively
associated with tweets and cessation-related help seeking on
Wikipedia and Google (Figure 3). Specifically, a 50% increase
in cessation-related news media predicted a 12% (95% CI −22
to 46) increase in Internet cessation queries and 26% (95% CI
−22 to 73) increase for Wikipedia cessation page visits, albeit
neither trend was statistically significant based on a small sample
of 6 years. Quitline calls were inversely related to news media,
a relationship largely driven mute by the 2 most recent years
when quitline call increases were greatest and news volume was
lowest.
To provide a comparison for the GASO, we fitted similar models
for increases around New Year’s Day, the only other period
with visually significant spikes. Over all New Years
(2009-2014), for example, news media coverage of cessation
increased by 121% (95% CI 101-139) and Internet searches
were 37% (95% CI 26-47) higher around New Year’s Day.
Thus, the GASO approximates 70% of the expected increase
in news media and 68% of the expected increase in cessation
searches for New Year’s Day (ΔGASO divided by ΔNYD).

Discussion
This study demonstrated a novel big data approach to rapidly,
cost-effectively, and efficiently evaluate hundreds of awareness
campaigns, nearly all for the first time. In doing so we found
that 
the 
GASO 
often 
corresponded 
with 
increased
cessation-related news coverage and cessation-related help
seeking on Google, Wikipedia, and quitlines.
Our case study provided insights into how the GASO may have
filtered through to the public and influenced cessation-related
behavior in a way that has not been possible with traditional
data. For example, we found that the GASO corresponded with
increased cessation-related news coverage. Although this
increase was not associated with more cessation-related tweets,
it did correspond with about 61,000 more instances of
cessation-related help seeking on Google, Wikipedia, and
quitlines each year. These increases also compared favorably
with New Year’s Day, representing about two-thirds of the
effectiveness of New Year’s Day for news media and Google
searches. Most critically, these novel effectiveness estimates
offer suggestions for how GASO can be expanded or modified
to further enhance its impact.
Because media messages need to be timed to reach receptive
audiences [29], one suggestion to better ensure GASO’s
cessation messages reach a more receptive audience would be
to relocate these on the calendar. GASO is currently celebrated
close to the holiday season when the lowest cessation-related
help-seeking outcomes were observed. Add to this the recent
discoveries about repeating seasonal [25] and circaseptan (day
of the week) [26,27] patterns in cessation contemplations with
the greatest interest during late winter and particularly on
Monday, an empirically justified date of observing GASO, for
example, would be the last Monday in February. With more
smokers primed to consider cessation already, the GASO may
very well realize larger increases apart from any specific change
to its implementation.

 Another potential strategy to improve effectiveness would be
to attempt to increase news coverage, which, although positively
related to changes in Google and Wikipedia help seeking for
cessation, has been down most recently. Based on a review of
prior press releases, it appears that GASO uses a repeating theme
focused on smoking cessation alone. Changing themes each
year to highlight novel content, such as rare health risks as with
the Tips from Former Smokers Campaign [30], may engender
more widespread media attention. For example, World No
Tobacco Day changes themes every year and a recent analysis
of that campaign showed more consistent year-to-year spikes
in news coverage and correspondingly more consistent help
seeking for smoking cessation on Google [12].
An enhanced strategic focus for using Twitter could also
potentially increase GASO’s effect on discussions about quitting.
A reliance on news media to propagate tweets is not likely to
be effective given the weak relationship between news coverage
and tweets. Only recently has the American Cancer Society
addressed the GASO’s social media presence, which has
included a handful of tweets announcing the GASO, and/or a
few tweets with quitting tips leading up to and including the
day of the GASO. Most tobacco control programs have been
slow to adopt online social marketing strategies [31] and some
that have engaged in these activities were quickly met with
opposition or “Twitter Bombing” [32]. How best to engage
awareness campaigns on social media websites, such as Twitter,
continues to remain an important open question. With
cessation-related tweets highest in 2011, GASO implementers
might further investigate the context of that year and why tweets
spiked.
The increase in online help seeking was promising, but these
increases need to be concomitant with strategies to better ensure
that those seeking help have an online pathway to
evidence-based cessation assistance. Given the frequency with
which smokers seek and find dubious cessation treatments
online, such as laser therapies [33,34], a strategy to direct
smokers to evidence-based cessation aids (such as information
available at smokefree.gov, becomeanex.org, or cancer.org)
may be beneficial for smokers attempting to quit [35]. This can
be achieved in several ways such as purchasing advertisements
on search engines for reliable cessation support or curating
Wikipedia entries to provide reliable cessation support. For the
latter, at the time we studied the general cessation Wikipedia
entry, it did not include any reference to or links to proven
cessation techniques, but an effort by the Society for Nicotine
and Tobacco Research is underway to revise and update relevant
Wikipedia entries. Similarly, tailoring of quitline call scripts to
target GASO-motivated callers may encourage cessation by
highlighting how more smokers are choosing to quit on the
GASO. This could potentially increase conversions from callers
contemplating to making a quit attempt via social norm
mechanisms [36].
A limitation of our analyses is that (even with multiple data
sources) we could not observe all the pathways by which the
GASO could motivate help seeking. For example, radio
discussions about cessation might motivate purchases of nicotine
replacement therapies at brick-and-mortar stores, both of which
we did not observe. However, given that television and radio
news strongly correlate with print news in other settings [37]
and the Internet is by far the most popular vehicle for health
seeking, we would not expect the overall interpretation of the
campaign’s effectiveness to change substantially. Still, we are
actively working on identifying and adding additional data
sources to our novel evaluation framework, such as Facebook
[38,39]. In the same vein, our analysis focused on a single trend
from each data source and did not describe subtle variations in
the content of news, tweets, Google searches, etc. In subsequent
evaluations, we plan to enhance our framework by diving deeper
into these data, as we have done with searches for syndromic
surveillance [40]. Last, the validity of our metrics is unknown
because we were not able to make comparisons with surveys
or other traditional data. Nonetheless, where overlap exists, our
novel data sources often compare favorably with more traditional
data. For example, Google searches mirror both disease
outbreaks [41,42] and behavioral outcomes [43], including
tobacco-related behaviors [44,45].
This study serves as an example framework for how to leverage
big data for novel evaluations of awareness campaigns. As a
result, the goals of awareness campaigns, like GASO’s vital
aim to encourage quitting, can be better realized based on
scientific data. Moreover, if GASO and related awareness
campaigns are modified or enhanced based on the interpretation
of our results, they can be swiftly reassessed using the same
low-cost, fine-grained, and real-time big data framework.
