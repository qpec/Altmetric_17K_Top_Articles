ABSTRACT 
Objective: To study pregnancy rates after appendicectomy and /or tonsillectomy.  
Design: A population based cohort study using the UK primary health care based Clinical 
Practice Research Datalink (CPRD).  
Setting: UK Primary Care 
Patients: Female patients who underwent appendicectomy, tonsillectomy or both between 
1987 and 2012 and appropriate comparators. 
Intervention:  Timed follow up until first pregnancy after surgery. The association between 
prior surgery and subsequent pregnancy was determined by Cox regression models. 
Main Outcome Measures: Pregnancy rate and time to first pregnancy after surgery. 
Results: The analyses included 54,675 appendicectomy only patients, 112,607 tonsillectomy 
only patients, 10,340 patients who had both appendicectomy and tonsillectomy with 
355,244 comparators matched for exact age and practice from the rest of female patients in 
the database. There were 29,732 (54.4%), 60,078 (53.4%) and 6,169 (59.7%) pregnancies in 
the appendicectomy only, tonsillectomy only and both appendicectomy tonsillectomy 
cohorts respectively vs 155,079 (43.7%) in the comparator cohort during a mean follow up 
of 14.7 (SD, 9.7) years. Adjusted hazard ratios (HRs) for subsequent birth rates were 1.34 
(95% CI 1.32 to 1.35), 1.49 (95%CI 1.48 to 1.51) and 1.43 (95%CI 1.39 to 1.47), 
respectively. Time to pregnancy was shortest after both appendicectomy and tonsillectomy 
followed by appendicctomy only and then tonsillectomy only in comparison to the rest of 
the population. 
Conclusions: Appendicectomy and /or tonsillectomy were associated with increased 
subsequent pregnancy rates and shorter time to pregnancy.  The effect of the surgical 
procedures on the pregnancy outcome was cumulative.

INTRODUCTION 
Appendicectomy and tosillectomy are amongst the most common surgical procedures, particularly 
in children and young adults 1, 2. The lifetime risk of appendicectomy is estimated to be 10 – 20% 3, 
4 and this risk is nearly as high as for tonsillectomy before the age of 20 years 5. The appendix and 
tonsils are secondary lymphoid organs and prominent constituents of the mucosa-associated 
lymphoid tissue (MALT) system. The lymphoid function of these tissues is particularly 
pronounced at young age 2, 6-9 but continues attenuated into adulthood. 
We have previously shown that appendicectomy in females is associated with an increased 
subsequent pregnancy rate and shorter time to pregnancy (TTP) in two different populations 10, 11. 
In these studies, two matched cohorts from different populations were followed up after 
appendicectomy. In one study, a local database included 2935 patients who had appendicectomy 
and 5870 comparators between 1980 and 200810. The second study included 76,426 
appendicectomy patients, with 152,852 comparators from the Clinical Practice Research Datalink 
(CPRD) database between 1986 and 200911. The pregnancy rate was found to be increased by 20% 
and 54% respectively in the two cohorts of patients who had appendicectomy when compared 
with comparators10, 11. A Swedish study similarly found an association between removal of a normal 
appendix or a non-perforated appendix and a higher subsequent birth rate in women aged less than 
25 years12. Although we were surprised by our findings, we postulated that the increased pregnancy 
rate following appendicectomy might be related to removal of the appendix, which if left can have 
episodes of subclinical, chronic or recurrent inflammation. The removal of the cause of local 
inflammation or inflammatory adhesions in the vicinity of the pelvic fallopian tubes protects their 
patency. In order to further explore the possible mechanisms of this association, we selected 
another cohort of females who had removal of a different lymphoid organ located at a remote site 
from the pelvis. We examined the subsequent pregnancy rate in a cohort of females who had 
previous tonsillectomy.  
  
3 
Our hypothesis was that prior tonsillectomy would not alter subsequent pregnancy rate if local 
pelvic inflammation or inflammatory adhesions formation, reduced by appendicectomy were 
significant factors in the observed increased pregnancy rate.  
The aim of this study was thus to compare pregnancy rates in cohorts who had appendicectomy, 
tonsillectomy or both surgical procedures in comparison with an appropriate control cohort from 
the general population in the UK Clinical Practice Research Data-link.

METHODS 
Study Design:  
This was a population based cohort study using the prospectively collected data from the UK 
Clinical Practice Research Data-link  (CPRD)13. CPRD is the world's largest computerised database 
of anonymised longitudinal medical records from primary care. It contains individual patient’s 
primary care records from over 500 primary care practices with 4.4 million active patients 
throughout the UK. The data has been collected since 1987, it covers about 9% of the UK 
population and it is generalisable to the whole UK population. The National Health Service in the 
UK is tax-funded, free at the point of delivery, and it covers the entire population. Each patient 
has a unique health index number and all health visits are recorded under this number. CPRD 
captures data on diagnosis, prescriptions, primary care test results, hospital referral and admissions. 
The dataset also contains information on lifestyle and anthropometric measurements. CPRD also 
holds the Hospital Episode Statistics (HES) data for about 40% of the practices, which started 
from 1997 onwards. HES contains routinely collected administrative data, which covers hospital 
in-patient and day case care in the National Health Service. As such, HES data is more accurate, 
reliable and provides additional information. HES data was linked for each person showing 
successive admissions, operations, morbidities and mortality derived from death registration. 
Morbidity data were coded according to the International Classification of Diseases (ICD) 9th or 10th 
editions. Surgical operations data were coded according to the 4th revision of the Office of 
Population Censuses and Surveys’ (OPCS) classification of surgical operations.  
Exposure cohorts: Data were extracted from the CPRD database using the search terms for 
‘appendicectomy’, ‘tonsillectomy’ or ‘appendicectomy and tonsillectomy’ and separated into the 
three respective cohorts. Selected subjects were females who had a record of the index surgical 
procedure(s) and who were below the age of 45 between 1987 and 2012. Subjects entered the study 
at the date of the surgical procedure (or the earlier surgical procedure if they had both) and were 
followed up until December 2012. For HES data, the exposure cohort was extracted from the 
  
5 
HES database with the primary OPCS codes of (H011, H012, H013, H018 and H019) for 
appendicectomy, (F34, F341, F342, F343, F344, F345, F346, F347, F348 and F349) for 
tonsillectomy or both codes for the composite cohort.  
Comparator cohort: An exact age and practice-matched cohort of 2 comparators for each study 
subject was generated from the rest of the CPRD female population who did not have an 
appendicectomy or tonsillectomy during the same period. Controls entered the study on the same 
date as the relevant exposure cohort. For HES data, the comparator cohort was extracted from the 
HES database excluding patients who had appendicectomy or tonsillectomy. 
Scientific Approval: Approval for this study was obtained from the Independent Scientific 
Advisory Committee for Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency (MHRA) database 
research. 
Exclusions: Subjects were excluded from the study if they were under 12 years old at the end of 
follow up or had less than 30 days of follow-up available. Subjects were censored after the first 
pregnancy, if they reached the age of 53 years, had a sterilisation, hysterectomy, died or reached the 
end of the study follow up. 
Study outcome: The study outcome was the first recorded delivery of a live birth, miscarriage or 
termination during the follow up period and we used the date of the first of these events. Outcome 
ascertainment was obtained from the GP records with potential pregnancy codes and cross checked 
against a previous publication14, or the HES database with the primary ICD9 codes (630-676) and 
ICD10 codes (O00-O99 and Z34-Z39). 
Definition of co-variates: Age at entry to the study was a covariate as was parity, use of oral 
contraceptives, the number of previous hospitalisations, inflammatory bowel disease (ICD10 codes 
K50, K51, K52), pelvic inflammatory disease (ICD10 codes N70, N71, N73, N74), recorded 
chlamydial infection (ICD 10 codes A55-56, A70-74 ), other abdominal surgery (defined by 
OPCS4 codes), smoking history, Body Mass Index (BMI) and Index of Multiple deprivation Score 
  
6 
(a measure of socioeconomic status available in CPRD data set). The covariates were selected on 
the basis of their availability in the database and biological plausibility to influence sexual activity 
and / or fecundity. 
Statistical analysis: For the exposure and comparator cohorts, data were presented as 
mean (SD) for continuous variables and as numbers (%) for categorical variables. The 
distribution of categorical variables were compared and examined using the Chi-squared 
test between the exposure groups and appropriate comparators. Cox proportional-hazards 
regression models with a time dependent variable of oral contraceptives use, were used to 
determine the association between the study and comparator groups. Uni-variate and multi-
variate analyses were carried out. In the multi-variate models the hazards ratios were 
adjusted for all covariates between the study and control groups. The results were expressed 
as hazards ratios (95% confidence intervals). A ratio larger than 1, implied a greater 
probability of a pregnancy in the exposure group earlier than in the comparator group. 
Pregnancy events were plotted by Kaplan-Meier curves.  
Sensitivity analysis: Several sensitivity analyses were performed to test the robustness of the 
results. We repeated the analysis by using only the practices that had the HES dataset record-
linked. In this case, appendicectomy, tonsillectomy, pregnancy and the co-variates (except oral 
contraceptives) were extracted from the HES dataset. All covariates were adjusted for 5 years 
prior to cohort study entry (baseline). A sensitivity analysis was carried out to exclude patients 
who may have been pregnant before and during the appendicectomy episode. Another 
sensitivity analysis was done which included covariates that occurred both prior to and after 
study entry in the matched cohort. Due to the time span of the study with evolution in 
surgical practice, a further sensitivity analysis was carried out to assess the calendar year as a 
covariate. An additional sensitivity analysis was carried out to establish whether there was an 
additive effect to the two surgical procedures on the pregnancy outcome. An exploratory 
analysis was carried out to examine the effect of having the exposure (operative procedure) in 
childhood (<16 years of age) or adulthood (>16 years of age).  
  
7 
All Statistical analyses were carried out using SAS (version 9.2). 
 
RESULTS 
Cohorts characteristics: The study contained 54,675 subjects in the appendicectomy only cohort, 
112,607 in the tonsillectomy only cohort, 10,340 in the appendicectomy and tonsillectomy cohort 
and 355,244 age and practice matched subjects in the comparator cohort (Table 1). More subjects 
in the surgical cohorts (appendicectomy, tonsillectomy or both) in comparison to the appropriate 
comparators used oral contraceptives previously and had a diagnosis of inflammatory bowel 
disease, pelvic inflammatory disease and chlamydial infections. In addition, more of them had 
previous surgical operations and a previous pregnancy. The average age at tonsillectomy was 10.8 
years (± 7.2) and was lower than that for appendicectomy; 16.2 years (± 7.8).  
Pregnancy rates: During a mean follow up of 14.7 (SD, 9.7) years, 29,732 (54.4%), 60,078 
(53.4%) and 6,169 (59.7%) first pregnancies were recorded in the appendicectomy only, 
tonsillectomy only and the appendicectomy and tonsillectomy cohorts respectively in comparison 
to 155,079 (43.7%) in the comparator cohort. The first pregnancy events were more frequent in 
the appendicectomy and tonsillectomy cohorts than in the respective comparator cohorts, adjusted 
HRs for subsequent pregnancy rates in the appendicectomy only, tonsillectomy only and the 
appendicectomy and tonsillectomy cohorts respectively were 1.34 (95% CI 1.32 to 1.35), 1.49 
(95%CI 1.48 to 1.51) and 1.43 (95%CI 1.39 to 1.47), respectively (Table 2). The Time to Pregnancy 
(TTP) after the index surgical procedure(s) was progressively shorter after tonsillectomy, 
appendicectomy and after both tonsillectomy and appendicectomy in comparison to the 
comparator cohort (Figure 1).  
Sensitivity analyses: In order to establish whether the effects of previous appendicectomy and 
tonsillectomy were additive, we carried out several sensitivity analyses.  The HR (95% CI) results 
changed slightly across different analyses (Tables 2).  
  
8 
Another analysis was carried out on only the proportion of the population within the HES 
database. From the total cohort, there were 67,613 patients from practices which had data that 
could be linked to Hospital Episodes Statistics (HES) database (6,757 patients in the 
appendicectomy only cohort, 15,544 in the tonsillectomy only cohort, 355 in the appendicectomy 
and tonsillectomy cohort and 45,312 patients in the comparator cohort). The adjusted HRs (95% 
CI) for subsequent pregnancy rates in the appendicectomy only, tonsillectomy only and the 
appendicectomy and tonsillectomy cohorts respectively were changed slightly to 1.54 (95%: CI 
1.46 - 1.63), 1.40 (95% CI: 1.34 - 1.46) and 1.62 (95% CI: 1.31 – 2.00) (Table 3). Further sensitivity 
analysis adjusting for BMI, smoking and previous pregnancies (including pregnancies during the 
surgical episode) made minor changes to the HR (95% CI), (Table 3). 
Further 
exploratory 
analysis 
showed 
a 
very 
strong 
association 
between 
appendicectomy/tonsillectomy and miscarriage (number of events=19,498) with adjusted HRs of 
1.61 (95% CI 1.53 - 1.68) for the appendicectomy only cohort, 1.60 (95% CI 1.54 - 1.66) for the 
tonsillectomy only cohort and 1.74 (95% CI 1.59 - 1.91) for the appendicectomy and tonsillectomy 
cohort compared with the comparator cohorts. A similar association was observed between the 
surgical procedures and live births with adjusted HRs of 1.38 (95% CI 1.35 – 1.42), 1.50 (1.48 – 
1.60) and 1.47 (95% CI 1.42 – 1.53) for the appendicectomy only, the tonsillectomy only and for 
the appendicectomy and tonsillectomy cohorts respectively, (Table 2). 
Another exploratory analysis showed that the effect sizes were similar in patients who had the 
operative procedures in childhood (≤16 years old) (n= 351,988) or in adulthood (>16 years old) 
(n= 180,878). The adjusted HRs for patients who had the operative procedures in childhood were 
1.35 (95% CI 1.33 - 1.38), 1.51 (95% CI 1.49 - 1.53) and 1.46 (95% CI 1.41 - 1.52) for the 
appendicectomy only cohort, the tonsillectomy only cohort and the appendicectomy and 
tonsillectomy cohort respectively, when compared with the comparator cohorts. The 
corresponding figures for patients who had the operative procedures in adulthood were 1.31 (95% 
CI 1.28 - 1.33), 1.45 (95% CI 1.42 - 1.48) and 1.39 (95% CI 1.34 - 1.45) respectively, (Table 2).

DISCUSSION 
The results from this population-based study confirmed the previously reported observation of a 
higher pregnancy rate and shorter time to pregnancy (TTP) following appendicectomy 10, 11. The 
adjusted HR for the pregnancy outcome in females who had a previous appendicectomy was 1.34 
(95% CI 1.32 to 1.35). Having selected a positive control group who had tonsillectomy (removal of 
another lymphoid organ at a remote site from the pelvis), we were further surprised to find that 
removal of the tonsils also increased the subsequent pregnancy rate with an adjusted HR 1.49 
(95%CI 1.48 to 1.51) with a shorter TTP after surgery and removal of both the appendix and 
tonsils resulted in an adjusted HR 1.43 (95%CI 1.39 to 1.47) and the shortest TTP after surgery. 
The association was strong between the surgical procedures and both subsequent miscarriages and 
live birth pregnancies. Given that the groups with previous appendicectomy, tonsillectomy or both 
procedures also had a higher rate of inflammatory bowel disease, pelvic inflammatory disease and 
previous surgery than the control population, which may reduce sexual activity 15 and pregnancy 
rate, the effect size of a higher subsequent pregnancy rate and shorter TTP after surgery in the 
index groups is counter intuitive. The results suggest that the increased subsequent pregnancy rate 
and shorter TTP after surgery may not be due to pelvic local mechanisms as we had hypothesised.  
One possible explanation is that by selecting for cohorts who had appendicectomy or 
tonsillectomy this study has inadvertently selected a female phenotype that had more frequent 
sexual intercourse (higher libido, a more liberal attitude towards sex or unknown factors). Our data 
shows that the groups with previous appendicectomy and tonsillectomy had a higher rate of 
chlamydial infections, pelvic inflammatory disease and previous pregnancies; all surrogate markers 
of increased sexual activity. The tonsillectomy cohort had a higher rate of oral contraceptive use 
than the appendicectomy cohorts but lower than the comparator group. The surgery cohort also 
had a higher rate of inflammatory bowel disease. It is possible that episodes of pelvic inflammatory 
disease resulting from liberal sexual activity or inflammatory bowel disease, necessitated hospital 
admission with lower abdominal pain which eventually lead to removal of the appendix. Indeed 
prior to the widespread adoption of laparoscopy for young women with right iliac fossa pain, 
  
10 
approximately a third of appendices removed were histologically normal16. By the same rationale a 
similar group of females developed recurrent throat infections as a result of intimate contact with 
males, which led to recurrent episodes of tonsillitis necessitating surgery. 
Another intriguing and biologically plausible explanation for the increased subsequent pregnancy 
rate and shorter time to pregnancy (TTP) after appendicectomy and tonsillectomy or both is due 
to reduced systemic inflammation emanating from these organs. A degree of systemic or uterine 
inflammation is essential for normal implantation and pregnancy13, 17, 18. However, when 
inflammation becomes too excessive, chronic or consists of specific mediators in high 
concentration, it might cause degeneration of the embryo and impaired implantation 19. In general, 
patients with inflammatory bowel disease have fewer children than the general population 20. An 
active disease decreases fertility significantly via inflammation, surgical sequel, secondary 
amenorrhoea or sexual dysfunction 20.  Similarly, untreated asthma significantly prolongs time to 
pregnancy and reduce fertility mainly because of systemic inflammation 21. The same applies to 
untreated rheumatoid arthritis 22. It is likely that the increased time to pregnancy in these disorders 
is biological rather than behavioural 15. The appendix and tonsils are lymphoid organs which may 
be susceptible to episodic, chronic and or recurrent inflammation either de novo23, 24 or after 
previous acute attacks24, 25. Surgical removal may reduce the risk of attacks of inflammation related 
to these organs, which could result in improved wellbeing of young females including a more 
permissible utero-tubo-ovarian environment for a pregnancy 15.  
For a successful pregnancy, active maternal tolerance to foreign fetal alloantigens is a prerequisite 
for successful trophoblast implantation and fetal development. The appendix and tonsils are 
secondary lymphoid organs. Removal of the appendix and/ or tonsils can alter several aspects of 
immune reactivity 8, 26. The effect seems to be more pronounced when both the appendix and 
tonsils are removed 8. These lymphoid organs are generally thought of as ‘gut associated’ with 
primary effects on gut immunity. Indeed, appendicectomy and tonsillectomy are risk factors for 
Crohn’s disease 27, 28 and appedicectomy appears to protect against ulcerative colitis 29, 30. The 
systemic affects can also manifest out with the gut. Appendicectomy and tonsillectomy are risk 
  
11 
factors for rheumatoid arthritis 31, premature acute myocardial infarction 32 and are associated with 
Hodgkin’s lymphoma 33, 34. It is conceivable that the systemic modulation of the immune response 
consequent on appendicectomy and or tonsillectomy at the feto-maternal interface is favourable 
towards the pregnancy outcome. It must be noted that where effect modification by age was 
considered in these studies, the associations seem to be restricted mainly or exclusively to 
individuals in whom the appendicectomy and/or tonsillectomy occurred before adulthood 29, 30, 34. 
Although the production of auto-antibodies by lymphoid tissue (via molecular mimicry, bystander 
cell activation, epitope spreading, etc.) during any infection, can induce reproductive pathology in 
the short term, removal of the appendix and tonsils, still leaves an abundance of lymphoid tissue to 
counteract infection (and auto-antibody production). However, the exposure and response of the 
remaining lymphoid tissue are possibly different or attenuated. Indeed, if autoimmune mechanisms 
were implicated in the apparent increase in fecundity in this study, we should observe a reduction 
in miscarriages. Although the recorded data in CPRD is not sufficiently reliable to include all 
miscarriages, an exploratory analysis has shown an increased number of miscarriages in the groups, 
which had appendicectomy and or tonsillectomy in comparison with comparators. Not 
withstanding the limitation of the data, an autoimmune modification explanation for the increased 
fecundity after lymphoid organ removal is less likely. Further, the effect sizes in this study were 
similar in patients who had the operative procedures in childhood (≤16 years old) and adulthood 
(>16 years old).  
Regardless of the explanation for the association between appendicectomy and/or tonsillectomy 
with increased pregnancy rate, there is sufficient evidence in this study for an association. The 
results reflect the practice of appendicectomy and or tonsillectomy over at least the last 30 years 
(the period of the current study). Recently, clinical practice has changed. Previously, the majority of 
young females with suspected acute appendicitis were referred for surgery and a third of 
appendices removed were normal35. Over the past 15 years, the majority of surgeons recommend a 
diagnostic laparoscopy to confirm the diagnosis16. If appendicitis was confirmed, appendicectomy 
was usually carried out laparoscopically at the same time. More recently, there has been a trend 
  
12 
towards antibiotic treatment for appendicitis particularly in children with or without interval 
appendicectomy35, 36. For tonsillitis, the indications for tonsillectomy have become even more 
controversial. A recent update on a Cochrane review concluded that tonsillectomy in children leads 
to a reduction in the number of episodes of sore throat and days with sore throat in comparison to 
non-surgical treatment 37. In practice, the rate of tonsillectomy in the general population has 
decreased markedly38. These changes to the management of relatively common conditions may 
impact on health consequences including the conception rates in the female population.  
This study was done using the whole of the CPRD data with subsequent sensitivity analyses on 
subgroups to adjust for confounders. This methodology is less likely to produce a positive 
correlation between the exposure and outcome.  The tonsillectomy group served as a positive 
control in this study. Despite its large size, long follow-up duration and population-based design, 
this study is subject to limitations. We relied on CPRD database, which provides good quality and 
reliable data, collected since 1987. HES data were collected from 1997 onwards and only for 40 % 
of practices. It is unlikely that the database missed a large number of females who had live birth 
pregnancies but it is likely that a number of females who had appendicectomy and/or 
tonsillectomy were missed. In addition, it is very likely that the database has not recorded all 
episodes of spontaneous abortions or terminations. However, the effect is unlikely to be 
differential or influence the results appreciably. To address this, we have age matched for the 
exposure and carried out sensitivity analysis on calendar time and inclusion in HES data, which 
recorded admissions for abortion/ termination. 
As with all observational studies, confounding factors, which we did not adjust for could explain 
our findings. For example, marital status, frequency of intercourse, use of other methods of 
contraception and wish to conceive may in theory explain our results. We could not adjust for 
these factors. We have however adjusted for socio-economic status, smoking history, BMI and 
previous pregnancies. Similarly, we did not have access to reliable pathology data on the removed 
appendix and tonsils. However, a previous study has shown that irrespective of pathology of the 
removed appendix subsequent pregnancy rates were increased after appendicectomy11.  
  
13 
In conclusion, we have found an increased pregnancy rate and reduced time to pregnancy after 
appendicectomy and tonsillectomy. The explanation and mechanism of pregnancy facilitation after 
removal of these lymphoid organs remains speculative. However it is possible that young females 
with recurrent attacks or chronic symptoms of appendicitis or tonsillitis will stand a better chance 
of conception after removal of these lymphoid organs. Based on the results of this study, 
management algorithms and guidelines should stipulate a lower threshold for appendectomy and 
tonsillectomy in young females with acute, recurrent or chronic inflammation in these organs. 
Surgeons can reassure young females that there is no increased risk of infertility after 
appendicectomy and/ or tonsillectomy.
