ABSTRACT
BACKGROUND Absence of cardiovascular risk factors (CVRFs) is traditionally considered low risk for atherosclerosis;
however, individuals without CVRFs, as currently defined, still have events.
OBJECTIVES This study sought to identify predictors of subclinical atherosclerosis in CVRF-free individuals.
METHODS Participants from the PESA (Progression of Early Subclinical Atherosclerosis) study (n ¼ 4,184) without
conventional CVRFs were evaluated (n ¼ 1,779; 45.0 � 4.1 years, 50.3% women). CVRF freedom was defined as no current
smoking and untreated blood pressure <140/90 mm Hg, fasting glucose <126 mg/dl, total cholesterol <240 mg/dl,
low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C) <160 mg/dl, and high-density lipoprotein cholesterol $40 mg/dl.
A subgroup with optimal CVRFs (n ¼ 740) was also defined as having blood pressure <120/80 mm Hg, fasting
glucose <100 mg/dl, glycosylated hemoglobin <5.7%, and total cholesterol <200 mg/dl. We evaluated ultrasound-
detected carotid, iliofemoral, and abdominal aortic plaques; coronary artery calcification; serum biomarkers; and lifestyle.
Adjusted odds ratios (with 95% confidence interval) and ordinal logistic regression models were used.
RESULTS Subclinical atherosclerosis (plaque or coronary artery calcification) was present in 49.7% of CVRF-free par-
ticipants. Together with male sex and age, LDL-C was independently associated with atherosclerosis presence and extent,
in both the CVRF-free and CVRF-optimal groups (odds ratio [�10 mg/dl]: 1.14 to 1.18; p < 0.01 for all). Atherosclerosis
presence and extent was also associated in the CVRF-free group with glycosylated hemoglobin levels.
CONCLUSIONS Many CVRF-free middle-aged individuals have atherosclerosis. LDL-C, even at levels currently
considered normal, is independently associated with the presence and extent of early systemic atherosclerosis in
the absence of major CVRFs. These findings support more effective LDL-C lowering for primordial prevention, even
in individuals conventionally considered at optimal risk. (Progression of Early Subclinical Atherosclerosis [PESA]

 C
ardiovascular risk in asymptomatic
individuals is assessed on the basis
of conventional cardiovascular risk
factors
(CVRFs),
and
most
cardiovascular
events are linked to elevated CVRFs (1). How-
ever,
atherosclerosis
and
cardiovascular
events are common even among individuals
with a low CVRF burden (2–4). This is espe-
cially the case among younger adults and
women, who can experience cardiovascular
events
despite
being
considered
at
low
short-term risk (5–7). According to current
preventive recommendations (8), healthy in-
dividuals
without
CVRFs
(as
presently
defined) are usually not considered a target
for prevention strategies despite the possible
presence of atherosclerosis.
Subclinical atherosclerosis underlies most
cardiovascular events, and its detection can improve
risk stratification (9,10). However, a mismatch has
been reported between low conventional risk and the
presence of subclinical atherosclerosis detected by
coronary artery calcification (CAC) or carotid ultra-
sound
(11,12).
Our
group
identified
subclinical
atherosclerosis in nearly 60% of middle-aged in-
dividuals classified at low risk according to traditional
risk scales, with multiple vascular sites affected in
41% (13). These findings demonstrate a disparity be-
tween
conventional
CVRFs
and
the
presence
of
atherosclerosis, suggesting that other factors play a
role in atherogenesis. In this study, we aimed to
explore
and
identify
potential
predictors
of
the
presence and multiterritorial extent of subclinical
atherosclerosis in the absence of major CVRFs.
METHODS
STUDY DESIGN. This study was conducted in a subset
of individuals from the PESA (Progression of Early
Subclinical Atherosclerosis) study (13–15) with CVRF
levels below current thresholds. The PESA study uses
noninvasive imaging to prospectively evaluate the
presence and progression of subclinical atheroscle-
rosis in a middle-aged population of 4,184 adults aged
between 40 and 54 years. The main exclusion criteria
were known cardiovascular disease, active treatment
for cancer, or any disease expected to decrease life
expectancy
or
protocol
adherence.
Participants
underwent clinical interviews, physical activity and
lifestyle evaluations, physical examination, electro-
cardiogram, laboratory analysis, and imaging studies
at baseline, with repeat evaluations scheduled for
3- and 6-year follow-up visits. The study protocol was
approved by the Instituto de Salud Carlos III Ethics
Committee
and
all
participants
provided
written
informed consent.
DEFINITION OF THE CVRF-FREE POPULATION AND
THE
CVRF-OPTIMAL
SUBGROUP. This
study
included nonsmokers with no hypertension, diabetes,
or dyslipidemia according to Adult Treatment Panel
III CVRF definitions (16,17): 1) untreated systolic
blood pressure <140 mm Hg and diastolic blood
pressure <90 mm Hg; 2) untreated fasting plasma
glucose <126 mg/dl; 3) untreated total cholesterol
<240
mg/dl,
low-density
lipoprotein
cholesterol
(LDL-C) <160 mg/dl, and high-density lipoprotein
cholesterol (HDL-C) $40 mg/dl; and 4) no current
smoking status. This subpopulation represents 42.5%
of the total PESA study population (Figure 1).
Within the conventional CVRF-free population, we
also defined a subgroup of individuals with optimal
modifiable
CVRFs
(3,18):
systolic
blood
pressure
<120 mm Hg, diastolic blood pressure <80 mm Hg,
total
cholesterol
<200
mg/dl,
fasting
plasma
glucose <100 mg/dl, and glycosylated hemoglobin
(HbA1c) <5.7%.
ASSESSMENT OF CVRFs, SERUM BIOMARKERS, AND
LIFESTYLE PARAMETERS. CVRFs were prospectively
collected through questionnaires (smoking, family
history) or objective quantification (hypertension,
diabetes, dyslipidemia) as previously described (13).
Family history of cardiovascular disease was defined
as having a first-degree relative diagnosed with clin-
ical atherosclerosis below 55 years of age in men and
65 years of age in women (16). Obesity was defined as
body mass index $30 kg/m2 (2,16). The 10-year risk of
atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease was calculated
using the Pooled Cohort Equations and cutoffs were
defined as <5%, 5% to <7.5%, and $7.5% for low,
intermediate, and high risk, respectively (19). The
30-year Framingham risk score was also measured
and classified as low (<10%), moderate (10% to 20%),
or high (<20%) risk (20).
Venous blood was collected after 8 h of fasting and
samples were tested for total cholesterol, HDL-C,
LDL-C, oxidized LDL-C, triglycerides, lipoprotein (a),
glucose, insulin, HbA1c, cystatin C, and creatinine by
standard methods (14). LDL-C was calculated by the
Friedewald method except for participants with tri-
glycerides
>300
mg/dl,
where
it
was
measured
directly. The estimated glomerular filtration rate
(eGFR) was calculated according to the Chronic Kid-
ney Disease Epidemiology Collaboration equation
(21). The baseline PESA study protocol also included
the following inflammation markers: high-sensitivity
C-reactive protein (hs-CRP), fibrinogen, vascular cell

 adhesion molecule (VCAM)-1, and P-selectin. Physical
activity was assessed by triaxial accelerometry with
ActiTrainer
accelerometers
(ActiGraph,
Pensacola,
Florida) placed on each participant’s waist for 7
consecutive days, including sleep time. Moderate and
vigorous physical activity were defined according to
standard Troiano cutoffs (22). We also calculated the
PREDIMED
(PREvencion
con
DIeta
MEDiterranea)
score, which reflects increasing adherence to Medi-
terranean diet (23,24). In addition, 7 ideal cardiovas-
cular health metrics were quantified, as recently
proposed (3).
ASSESSMENT OF SUBCLINICAL ATHEROSCLEROSIS. Two-
dimensional vascular ultrasound and noncontrast
cardiac computed tomography were performed in all
participants as previously described (13). In brief,
presence of atherosclerotic plaques by ultrasound
was assessed by cross-sectional sweep of carotids,
infrarenal abdominal aorta, and iliofemoral arteries.
Plaques were defined as focal protrusions into the
arterial lumen of thickness >0.5 mm or >50% of the
surrounding intima-media thickness, or as a diffuse
intima-media thickness >1.5 mm (25). The CAC score
was calculated from computed tomography images by
the Agatston method (26). All images were analyzed
at a central Imaging Core Laboratory by experienced,
blinded operators.
Subclinical
atherosclerosis
was
defined
as
the
presence of atherosclerotic plaques by vascular ul-
trasound or CAC score $1. The multiterritorial extent
of subclinical atherosclerosis was defined according
to the number of vascular sites with evidence of dis-
ease, including right carotid, left carotid, abdominal
aorta, right iliofemoral, left iliofemoral, and coronary
arteries. Participants were classified as disease free
(0 vascular sites affected) or having focal (1 site),
intermediate (2 to 3 sites), or generalized atheroscle-
rosis (4 to 6 sites) (13).
STATISTICS. The distribution of continuous variables
was analyzed using graphical methods. Log trans-
formation
was
performed
before
analyses
to
normalize the distribution as appropriate. Compari-
sons between participants with and without athero-
sclerosis were performed using a chi-square test for
categorical variables and the Student’s t-test for
continuous variables. Linear trends across groups
according to multiterritorial extent were evaluated
with an extension of the nonparametric Wilcoxon
rank sum test (27). Logistic and ordinal regression
models with forward stepwise variable selection were
used to analyze the associations of multiple cova-
riates with the presence and extent of atherosclerosis
in the CVRF-free and CVRF-optimal groups. Analyses
were
then
repeated
with
inclusion
restricted
to
participants
with
LDL-C
<130
mg/dl.
Candidate
variables with a clinical rationale explored in the
multivariate analyses included age, sex, body mass
index, systolic blood pressure, diastolic blood pres-
sure,
family
history
of
premature
cardiovascular
disease, fasting glucose, insulin, HbA1c, triglycerides,
HDL-C, LDL-C, oxidized LDL-C, lipoprotein (a), eGFR,
cystatin C, hs-CRP, VCAM-1, P-selectin, and fibrin-
ogen. Weight, height, obesity, total cholesterol, and
risk scores were excluded due to multicollinearity,
defined as a correlation r $0.8 between variables. To
better describe the association between the identified
independent
risk
factors
and
the
multiterritorial
extent of atherosclerosis, ordinal logistic regression
models were replicated after categorizing the index
variable into quintiles or 3 groups for age (40 to 44, 45
to 49, and 50 to 54 years of age). Associations were
expressed as odds ratio (OR) and standardized OR
with 95% confidence interval (CI). Statistical analyses
were conducted using Stata version 12 (StataCorp,
College
Station,
Texas).
A
p
value
<
0.05
was
considered statically significant.

 31.4% and 17.1% in the 45 to 49 and 50 to 54 years
of age subgroups, respectively). As expected, the
majority
of
individuals (94.6%)
had low
10-year
cardiovascular
risk;
intermediate
and
high
risk
were observed in 56 (3.1%) and 10 (0.6%) partici-
pants,
respectively.
The
corresponding
long-term

proportions
were
54.6%,
35.6%
and
9.8%.
Online Table 1 shows baseline characteristics of the
study population (CVRF free) and of the PESA par-
ticipants with CVRFs.
Tables 1 and 2 summarize baseline characteristics,
serum biomarkers, and lifestyle parameters of study
participants stratified according to the presence and
extent of atherosclerosis. All CVRFs, risk scores, and
lifestyle
measurements
except for
family
history
differed
significantly
according
to
atherosclerosis
status. Similarly, significant differences were found
in all serum biomarkers except for lipoprotein (a),
cystatin C, hs-CRP, and fibrinogen. Ideal cardiovas-
cular health metrics are shown in Online Table 2. As
expected in this CVRF-free population, ideal metrics
were prevalent, although only 121 (6.8%) participants
met all 7 ideal criteria. Significant differences in these
health
metrics
between
those
with
and
without
atherosclerosis were found for blood pressure, total
cholesterol, glucose, and body mass index, but not for
smoking, physical activity, and diet.
Despite the absence of conventional CVRFs, sub-
clinical atherosclerosis was highly prevalent (49.7%).
Overall, 46.7% had peripheral atherosclerotic pla-
ques: 22.7% in the carotid arteries, 17.2% in the
infrarenal aorta, and 30.1% in the iliofemoral arteries.

 CAC was detected in 11.1% of participants, the ma-
jority of them with mild calcification (183 individuals
with a CAC score <100, 14 with a score of 100 to 399,
and 1 with a score $400). Analysis of the extent of
atherosclerosis revealed focal disease in 22.6% of
participants,
intermediate
disease
in
20.9%,
and
generalized disease in 6.0%. Among participants with
optimal CVRFs (n ¼ 740) (Online Tables 3 and 4), 280
(37.8%) had atherosclerosis, with peripheral plaques
in 268 individuals and CAC in 43. In this subgroup,
focal, intermediate, and generalized atherosclerosis
was present in 20.8%, 13.8%, and 3.2% of partici-
pants, respectively.
PREDICTORS
OF
ATHEROSCLEROSIS
PRESENCE
AND MULTITERRITORIAL EXTENT. In the CVRF-free
population, univariable analyses showed significant
associations between disease presence and extent
and all measured variables except for family history
of cardiovascular disease, lipoprotein (a), cystatin C,
hs-CRP, and fibrinogen. VCAM-1 was associated with
the extent but not the presence of atherosclerosis
(Online Tables 5 and 6). In multivariable models, male
sex, age, LDL-C, and HbA1c were associated with the
presence of disease (Table 3). Age and sex showed the
strongest associations with atherosclerosis presence,
followed by LDL-C (Figure 2). The same variables, and
additionally VCAM-1 and cystatin C, were also asso-
ciated with multiterritorial extent of atherosclerosis
(Table 3). Figure 3 shows the stratification of these
associations according to age intervals (40 to 44, 45 to
49, and 50 to 54 years) by sex, and to quintiles for
LDL-C, HbA1c, VCAM-1, and cystatin C. Again, age and
sex demonstrated the strongest associations with
atherosclerosis multiterritorial extent, followed by
LDL-C (Figure 3). When restricting analyses to par-
ticipants with atherosclerosis, age, LDL-C, VCAM-1,
and systolic blood pressure were associated with

only age and triglycerides in the CVRF-optimal group;
however, sample size in the latter analysis was too
small (Online Table 7).
In the subgroup with optimal CVRFs, age, male sex,
and
LDL-C
were
the
only
variables
significantly
associated with both disease presence and multi-
territorial extent (Table 3). Similar to the overall
population, age and male sex had the strongest as-
sociations with the presence and extent of athero-
sclerosis (Figure 2).
In both the CVRF-free and CVRF-optimal groups,
results were similar when LDL-C was replaced by
non–HDL-C (Online Table 8).

WITH LDL-C <130 MG/DL. Similar results were obtained
in a further multivariable analysis restricted to in-
dividuals with LDL-C <130 mg/dl (1,107 CVRF free and
682 CVRF optimal). Age, male sex, and LDL-C were
the only variables associated with atherosclerosis
presence and multiterritorial extent in both groups.
In the CVRF-free group only, HbA1c was also associ-
ated with both atherosclerosis presence and extent,
and fibrinogen with extent (Table 4).

The relationship between LDL-C and atherosclerosis
in the absence of dyslipidemia, hypertension, dia-

is
illustrated
in
the
Central
Illustration and Figure 4. As LDL-C levels increased,
there was a linear and significant increase in the
prevalence of atherosclerosis, ranging from 11% in
the 60 to 70 mg/dl category to 64% in the 150 to
160 mg/dl subgroup (p < 0.001) (Central Illustration).
This progressive increase was noted in both men
and women (Online Figure 1). A similar pattern
was
observed
for
the
number
of
vascular
sites
affected (Central Illustration) and for each vascular
bed analyzed separately (Figure 4). Indeed, in a
secondary analysis by each vascular territory, LDL-C
remained associated with atherosclerosis presence
in each territory for the total CVRF-free population
(Online Table 9).
Finally, we also assessed whether LDL-C tracked
atherosclerosis similarly across 30-year Framingham
risk score categories. Whereas there was influence in

 DISCUSSION
Absence
of
conventional
CVRFs
is
traditionally
considered a reliable indicator of low atherosclerosis
risk. However, we identified subclinical atheroscle-
rosis in one-half of a CVRF-free middle-aged popu-
lation, with multiple vascular sites affected in nearly
30%.
This
finding
expands
on
previous
studies
examining the association of risk with subclinical
disease in single vascular territories (4,12), charac-
terizing
the
extent
of
systemic
atherosclerosis
through multiterritorial assessment in low-risk in-
dividuals.
Moreover, more
than one-third of in-
dividuals with optimal CVRF levels and an ostensibly
healthy status had subclinical atherosclerosis, sug-
gesting that additional, poorly defined factors play a
role in early atherogenesis. In the absence of con-
ventional CVRFs, the presence and extent of athero-
sclerosis were associated with age, male sex, LDL-C,
and HbA1c. Even with CVRF levels considered to be
optimal, atherosclerotic burden remained indepen-
dently associated with age, male sex, and LDL-C,
highlighting the crucial role of LDL-C in early dis-
ease stages.
The LDL-C hypothesis considers LDL-C as a causal
factor in atherosclerosis. Although this hypothesis is
generally accepted, controversy remains regarding its
validity (28,29). Evidence supporting this hypothesis
stems from experimental models, epidemiological
cohorts,
and
cholesterol-lowering
(mainly
statin-
based)
clinical
trials
(30).
However,
potential
remaining confounders should be considered. Ani-
mals used in experimental models typically develop
much higher concentrations of plasma cholesterol
than seen clinically (31), and results need to be
extrapolated to humans. Clinical studies have typi-
cally
enrolled
participants
with
either
clearly
abnormal lipid levels or coexisting CVRFs, which may
have
synergistic
or
additive
effects
on
disease
development (32). In addition, some benefits of statin
therapy may be related to pleiotropic effects beyond
cholesterol lowering (30). In this study of apparently
healthy
individuals
without
conventional
CVRFs,
we demonstrated an independent and direct link
between LDL-C levels and atherosclerotic burden.
In fact, LDL-C was the strongest modifiable factor
associated with atherosclerosis. Furthermore, even
when all other risk factors were at optimal levels, this
association persisted. Although association does not
equate with causation, in the context of extensive
prior data, we believe that these unique data from a
large human cohort eliminate some of the potential
confounders mentioned previously and provide indi-
rect but solid evidence for the central role of LDL-C in
early human atherogenesis. This is further highlighted
by our findings of associations between LDL-C and
disease in participants with low 30-year risk. These
results also support the notion that cholesterol alone,
in the absence of other known conventional CVRFs,
may be enough to drive the development of athero-
sclerosis in humans (33). Multivariable analysis yiel-
ded similar results when LDL-C was replaced with
non–HDL-C, suggesting no advantage of using one
lipid variable over the other. Conversely, the multi-
variable models showed no link to subclinical athero-
sclerosis
for
other
apolipoprotein
B–containing
particles, specifically oxidized LDL-C and lipoprotein
(a). Although these particles are in principle more
atherogenic, the absence of association may be related
to their low concentrations and the low between-
group variability in this CVRF-free population, and
their role may be more important in the setting of
higher cardiovascular risk (34). Importantly, LDL-C
levels in our population were well within the range
considered
normal,
reinforcing
the
concept
that
desirable LDL concentrations are probably much lower
than those currently recommended (35). If confirmed,
the results shown in the Central Illustration and Figure 4

 would indicate that atherosclerosis in both men
and women develops above an LDL-C threshold
concentration of approximately 50 to 60 mg/dl, similar
to the level associated with disease regression (36).
This
hypothesis
is
consistent
with
recent
lipid-
lowering trials, in which adverse clinical outcomes
were significantly reduced when LDL-C levels were
lowered below current targets (37). Thus, our findings
may
have
important
implications
for
primordial
prevention
strategies
and
for
establishing
cutoff
values to define lipid disorders.
Additional independent (and nonmodifiable) pre-
dictors of atherosclerosis included age and sex. It is
known that age is the most significant risk factor for
cardiovascular events (8), and we also showed a
strong association with subclinical atherosclerosis.
This is likely related to the longer exposure to a
variety of atherosclerotic risk determinants (e.g.,
LDL-C) as well as other aging-associated phenomena
such as increased nucleic acid damage, apoptosis, or
reduced regenerative capacity (38). Sex-based differ-
ences in atherosclerosis prevalence and severity are
also well described, with women experiencing their
first clinical event a decade later than men on average
(39). Underlying mechanisms are incompletely un-
derstood but are probably multifactorial, including
estrogen levels as well as differences in risk factor
prevalence and susceptibility, psychosocial factors,
and vascular biology (40).
In our study, HbA1c was also independently asso-
ciated with the presence and extent of subclinical
atherosclerosis in the absence of CVRFs, both for
participants with LDL-C <160 and <130 mg/dl, but not
in those participants with optimal CVRF levels. HbA1c
reflects average glucose levels in the previous 2 to
3 months and therefore provides an index of glucose

As LDL-cholesterol levels rise, there is a linear and significant increase in the prevalence of atherosclerosis, ranging from 11% in the 60 to 70 mg/dl
category to 64% in the 150 to 160 mg/dl subgroup (p < 0.001). A similar pattern is observed for the multiterritorial extent of atherosclerosis (focal,
intermediate or generalized disease) as well as for the mean number of vascular sites affected (blue line). LDL-C ¼ low-density lipoprotein cholesterol.

In

individuals,
higher HbA1c concentrations (between 5.7% and 6.4%)
were independently associated with increased CAC
and carotid intima-media thickness (41). In another
nondiabetic prospective series (n ¼ 2,652), the upper
2 quartiles of HbA1c levels (>5.7%) were linked to both
carotid intima-media thickness progression and car-

in

explaining

Although
again
our
data
do
not
establish a causal role, extensive prior evidence in-
dicates detrimental vascular effects of chronic hy-
perglycemia through a variety of mechanisms (43).
Other serum markers possibly associated with the
multiterritorial extent of
atherosclerosis included
VCAM-1 (an endothelial adhesion protein), cystatin C
(an endogenous marker of renal function) (45), and
fibrinogen (a hemostatic and inflammatory marker).
Although each of these markers has potential mech-
anistic links to
atherosclerosis, we
did
not find
consistent associations in our models, and their link
to atherosclerosis in the absence of CVRFs needs
further investigation. Interestingly, blood pressure
was not associated with systemic atherosclerosis in
our sample, although we found a link with carotid
disease (Online Table 9). We observed a paradoxical
response between subclinical disease and healthy
lifestyle
parameters,

 activity. Whether this unexpected finding reflects a
real biological process or the methodology used to
measure these complex and multifactorial parame-
ters is beyond the scope of this paper, and the in-
fluence of lifestyle behaviors has been addressed in
recent PESA publications (24). We hypothesize that
early atherogenesis in the absence of CVRFs and
even with optimal risk factors levels is driven by age,
sex, and LDL-C levels currently considered normal.
Mild elevations in HbA1c and advanced glycation
products (associated with glucose metabolic dysre-
gulation
and
aging)
may
cause
further
vascular
injury. Although our data support the central role of
LDL-C in early atherosclerosis, they do not exclude
potential contributions from other multiple factors,
which might be demonstrated with large sample
sizes. Thus, early control of all risk factors should be
taken into consideration for primordial prevention.
Our findings need to be placed in the context of the
CVRF definitions used here. Specifically, the defini-
tion of dyslipidemia is not universally accepted and
different lipid thresholds may slightly alter the re-
sults. However, we employed a commonly used
definition from the National Cholesterol Education
Program guidelines (16), in line with previous PESA
study publications (13). To test the consistency of our
results, we performed a secondary analysis including
LDL-C levels <130 mg/dl, obtaining comparable re-
sults. Similarly, there is no consensus definition of an
optimal risk profile. Our definition of optimal risk
individuals is largely based on widely accepted fac-
tors of ideal cardiovascular health (3); however, our
selection criteria did not include ideal cardiovascular
behaviors other than smoking because only 121 of
1,779 individuals in our cohort reached the ideal
levels for all 7 metrics. This very low ideal-health
prevalence, which is consistent with previous re-
ports (46), precluded meaningful statistical analysis.
Recent U.S. guidelines (19) propose different optimal
CVRF thresholds, but only 97 (5.5%) participants
in our study fulfilled these criteria (not shown),
again precluding meaningful multivariable analysis.
Similarly,
we
could
not
perform
multivariable
analysis
using
a
more
restrictive
LDL-C
cutoff
(<100 mg/dl) because of insufficient power (n ¼ 235,
not
shown).
In
any
case,
our
findings
strongly
suggest that thresholds to define elevated LDL-C
should be lower than recommended across current
guidelines.
STUDY LIMITATIONS. In the PESA study, diabetes
was diagnosed based on glucose levels and not on
HbA1c levels; the study population therefore included
a small proportion (0.17%) of participants with HbA1c
concentrations >6.4 mg/dl who could qualify as
having diabetes but were not excluded. However, a
sensitivity
analysis
excluding
these
participants
yielded similar results (not shown). The small number
of participants with LDL-C <70 mg/dl precludes
reaching strong conclusions about a potential LDL-C
threshold below which disease does not develop;
however, the linear trend observed across high LDL-C
levels supports the possibility of such a threshold. We
did not evaluate other nonmodifiable risk factors
(e.g., second-hand smoking or air pollution) and did
not explore the potential roles of diet and exercise in
greater detail because this was not the focus of this
study. However, diet and physical activity showed no
significant associations with atherosclerosis in the
main models used (not shown), probably due to the
homogeneity of these variables in our sample. Simi-
larly, we did not evaluate all possible serum bio-
markers because they were not included in the
baseline PESA study examination (4). Finally, we did
not evaluate the genetic contribution to disease
development (47,48), which can be independent of
CVRFs and could thus play an important role in our
population.
CONCLUSIONS
Subclinical atherosclerosis is present in one-half of
middle-aged PESA study individuals without major
CVRFs and in one-third of those in the CVRF-optimal
subgroup,
suggesting
that
additional
factors
are
involved
in
its
development.
LDL-C,
at
levels
currently considered normal, is independently asso-
ciated with the presence and extent of atherosclerosis
in this setting, including in those participants with
optimal risk profile. Thus, these data provide strong
evidence of a unique, independent role of LDL-C in
early
human
atherogenesis.
These
findings
have
important implications for guiding primordial pre-
vention and understanding the mechanisms under-
lying early atherosclerosis.

PERSPECTIVES
COMPETENCY IN MEDICAL KNOWLEDGE: Subclin-
ical atherosclerosis can be detected in about one-half of
otherwise healthy, middle-aged individuals without con-
ventional cardiovascular risk factors. Serum LDL-C levels,
even within the range currently considered normal, is
independently associated with the presence and extent of
subclinical atherosclerosis in multiple vascular territories.
TRANSLATIONAL OUTLOOK: The high global car-
diovascular burden of cardiovascular disease makes
effective primordial prevention a health care priority.
Prospective studies are needed to evaluate the efficacy of
more aggressive LDL-C lowering strategies at both the
individual and population levels to reduce the incidence
of clinical ischemic events.
