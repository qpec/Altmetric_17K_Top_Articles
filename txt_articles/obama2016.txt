United States Health Care Reform
Progress to Date and Next Steps
Barack Obama, JD
IMPORTANCE The Affordable Care Act is the most important health care legislation enacted in
the United States since the creation of Medicare and Medicaid in 1965. The law implemented
comprehensive reforms designed to improve the accessibility, affordability, and quality of
health care.
OBJECTIVES To review the factors influencing the decision to pursue health reform,
summarize evidence on the effects of the law to date, recommend actions that could
improve the health care system, and identify general lessons for public policy
from the Affordable Care Act.
EVIDENCE Analysis of publicly available data, data obtained from government agencies,
and published research findings. The period examined extends from 1963 to early 2016.
FINDINGS The Affordable Care Act has made significant progress toward solving
long-standing challenges facing the US health care system related to access, affordability,
and quality of care. Since the Affordable Care Act became law, the uninsured rate has
declined by 43%, from 16.0% in 2010 to 9.1% in 2015, primarily because of the law’
s reforms.
Research has documented accompanying improvements in access to care (for example, an
estimated reduction in the share of nonelderly adults unable to afford care of 5.5 percentage
points), financial security (for example, an estimated reduction in debts sent to collection of
$600-$1000 per person gaining Medicaid coverage), and health (for example, an estimated
reduction in the share of nonelderly adults reporting fair or poor health of 3.4 percentage
points). The law has also begun the process of transforming health care payment systems,
with an estimated 30% of traditional Medicare payments now flowing through alternative
payment models like bundled payments or accountable care organizations. These and related
reforms have contributed to a sustained period of slow growth in per-enrollee health care
spending and improvements in health care quality. Despite this progress, major opportunities
to improve the health care system remain.
CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE Policy makers should build on progress made by the
Affordable Care Act by continuing to implement the Health Insurance Marketplaces
and delivery system reform, increasing federal financial assistance for Marketplace enrollees,
introducing a public plan option in areas lacking individual market competition, and taking
actions to reduce prescription drug costs. Although partisanship and special interest
opposition remain, experience with the Affordable Care Act demonstrates that positive
change is achievable on some of the nation’
s most complex challenges.

Impetus for Health Reform
In my first days in office, I confronted an array of immediate chal-
lenges associated with the Great Recession. I also had to deal with
one of the nation’
s most intractable and long-standing problems, a
health care system that fell far short of its potential. In 2008, the
United States devoted 16% of the economy to health care, an in-
creaseofalmostone-quartersince1998(when13%oftheeconomy
was spent on health care), yet much of that spending did not trans-
lateintobetteroutcomesforpatients.1-4Thehealthcaresystemalso
fell short on quality of care, too often failing to keep patients safe,
waiting to treat patients when they were sick rather than focusing
on keeping them healthy, and delivering fragmented, poorly coor-
dinated care.5,6
Moreover, the US system left more than 1 in 7 Americans with-
out health insurance coverage in 2008.7 Despite successful efforts
in the 1980s and 1990s to expand coverage for specific popula-
tions, like children, the United States had not seen a large, sus-
tained reduction in the uninsured rate since Medicare and Medic-
aid began (Figure 18-10). The United States’high uninsured rate had
negative consequences for uninsured Americans, who experi-
encedgreaterfinancialinsecurity,barrierstocare,andoddsofpoor
healthandpreventabledeath;forthehealthcaresystem,whichwas
burdenedwithbillionsofdollarsinuncompensatedcare;andforthe
US economy, which suffered, for example, because workers were
concerned about joining the ranks of the uninsured if they sought
additional education or started a business.11-16 Beyond these statis-
tics were the countless, heartbreaking stories of Americans who
struggled to access care because of a broken health insurance sys-
tem. These included people like Natoma Canfield, who had over-
come cancer once but had to discontinue her coverage due to rap-
idly escalating premiums and found herself facing a new cancer
diagnosis uninsured.17
In 2009, during my first month in office, I extended the Chil-
dren’
s Health Insurance Program and soon thereafter signed the
American Recovery and Reinvestment Act, which included tempo-
rarysupporttosustainMedicaidcoverageaswellasinvestmentsin
health information technology, prevention, and health research to
improvethesysteminthelongrun.Inthesummerof2009,Isigned
the Tobacco Control Act, which has contributed to a rapid decline
in the rate of smoking among teens, from 19.5% in 2009 to 10.8%
in 2015, with substantial declines among adults as well.7,18
Beyondtheseinitialactions,Idecidedtoprioritizecomprehen-
sive health reform not only because of the gravity of these chal-
lengesbutalsobecauseofthepossibilityforprogress.Massachusetts
had recently implemented bipartisan legislation to expand health
insurancecoveragetoallitsresidents.LeadersinCongresshadrec-
ognizedthatexpandingcoverage,reducingthelevelandgrowthof
health care costs, and improving quality was an urgent national pri-
ority. At the same time, a broad array of health care organizations
and professionals, business leaders, consumer groups, and others
agreedthatthetimehadcometopressaheadwithreform.19Those
elementscontributedtomydecision,alongwithmydeeplyheldbe-
lief that health care is not a privilege for a few, but a right for all. Af-
ter a long debate with well-documented twists and turns, I signed
the ACA on March 23, 2010.
Progress Under the ACA
The years following the ACA’
s passage included intense implemen-
tation efforts, changes in direction because of actions in Congress
and the courts, and new opportunities such as the bipartisan pas-
sageoftheMedicareAccessandCHIPReauthorizationAct(MACRA)
in 2015. Rather than detail every development in the intervening
years, I provide an overall assessment of how the health care sys-
tem has changed between the ACA’
s passage and today.

Expanding and Improving Coverage
The ACA has succeeded in sharply increasing insurance coverage.
SincetheACAbecamelaw,theuninsuredratehasdeclinedby43%,
from 16.0% in 2010 to 9.1% in 2015,7 with most of that decline oc-
curringafterthelaw’
smaincoverageprovisionstookeffectin2014
(Figure 18-10). The number of uninsured individuals in the United
States has declined from 49 million in 2010 to 29 million in 2015.
This is by far the largest decline in the uninsured rate since the cre-
ationofMedicareandMedicaid5decadesago.Recentanalyseshave
concludedthesegainsareprimarilybecauseoftheACA,ratherthan
other factors such as the ongoing economic recovery.20,21 Adjust-
ing for economic and demographic changes and other underlying
trends, the Department of Health and Human Services estimated
that 20 million more people had health insurance in early 2016 be-
cause of the law.22
Eachofthelaw’
smajorcoverageprovisions—comprehensivere-
forms in the health insurance market combined with financial assis-
tance for low- and moderate-income individuals to purchase cover-
age, generous federal support for states that expand their Medicaid
programstocovermorelow-incomeadults,andimprovementsinex-
istinginsurancecoverage—hascontributedtothesegains.Statesthat
decided to expand their Medicaid programs saw larger reductions in

evenstatesthathavenotadoptedMedicaidexpansionhaveseensub-

also played a contributing role, covering an estimated 2.3 million
people after it took effect in late 2010.22
Early evidence indicates that expanded coverage is improving
access to treatment, financial security, and health for the newly in-
sured.Followingtheexpansionthroughearly2015,nonelderlyadults
experienced substantial improvements in the share of individuals
who have a personal physician (increase of 3.5 percentage points)

substantial decreases in the share who are unable to afford care
(decreaseof5.5percentagepoints)andreportingfairorpoorhealth
(decreaseof3.4percentagepoints)relativetothepre-ACAtrend.24
Similarly,researchhasfoundthatMedicaidexpansionimprovesthe
financialsecurityofthenewlyinsured(forexample,byreducingthe
amount of debt sent to a collection agency by an estimated $600-
$1000 per person gaining Medicaid coverage).26,27 Greater insur-
ance coverage appears to have been achieved without negative ef-
fects on the labor market, despite widespread predictions that the
lawwouldbea“jobkiller.”Private-sectoremploymenthasincreased

Data are derived from the Gallup-Healthways Well-Being Index as reported by
Witters23 and reflect uninsured rates for individuals 18 years or older. Dashed
lines reflect the result of an ordinary least squares regression relating the
change in the uninsured rate from 2013 to 2015 to the level of the uninsured
rate in 2013, run separately for each group of states. The 29 states in which
expanded coverage took effect before the end of 2015 were categorized as
Medicaid expansion states, and the remaining 21 states were categorized as
Medicaid nonexpansion states.

alignthemwiththeactualcostsofprovidingcare.Researchonhow
pastchangesinMedicarepaymentrateshaveaffectedprivatepay-
ment rates implies that these changes in Medicare payment policy
arehelpingdecreasepricesintheprivatesectoraswell.35,36TheACA
also included numerous policies to detect and prevent health care
fraud, including increased scrutiny prior to enrollment in Medicare
and Medicaid for health care entities that pose a high risk of fraud,
stronger penalties for crimes involving losses in excess of $1 mil-
lion, and additional funding for antifraud efforts. The ACA has also
widely deployed “value-based payment” systems in Medicare that
tiefee-for-servicepaymentstothequalityandefficiencyofthecare
delivered by health care organizations and health care profession-
als. In parallel with these efforts, my administration has worked to
fosteramorecompetitivemarketbyincreasingtransparencyaround
the prices charged and the quality of care delivered.
Mostimportantlyoverthelongrun,theACAismovingthehealth
care system toward “alternative payment models” that hold health
care entities accountable for outcomes. These models include
bundled payment models that make a single payment for all of the
services provided during a clinical episode and population-based
models like accountable care organizations (ACOs) that base pay-
ment on the results health care organizations and health care pro-
fessionals achieve for all of their patients’care. The law created the
Center for Medicare and Medicaid Innovation (CMMI) to test alter-
native payment models and bring them to scale if they are success-
ful, as well as a permanent ACO program in Medicare. Today, an es-
timated 30% of traditional Medicare payments flow through
alternativepaymentmodelsthatbroadenthefocusofpaymentbe-
yond individual services or a particular entity, up from essentially
none in 2010.37 These models are also spreading rapidly in the pri-
vate sector, and their spread will likely be accelerated by the physi-
cian payment reforms in MACRA.38,39
TrendsinhealthcarecostsandqualityundertheACAhavebeen
promising (Figure 41,40). From 2010 through 2014, mean annual
growth in real per-enrollee Medicare spending has actually been
negative, down from a mean of 4.7% per year from 2000 through
2005and2.4%peryearfrom2006to2010(growthfrom2005to
2006isomittedtoavoidincludingtherapidgrowthassociatedwith
the creation of Medicare Part D).1,40 Similarly, mean real per-
enrolleegrowthinprivateinsurancespendinghasbeen1.1%peryear
since 2010, compared with a mean of 6.5% from 2000 through
2005 and 3.4% from 2005 to 2010.1,40
Asaresult,healthcarespendingislikelytobefarlowerthanex-
pected. For example, relative to the projections the Congressional
Budget Office (CBO) issued just before I took office, CBO now proj-
ects Medicare to spend 20%, or about $160 billion, less in 2019
alone.41,42 The implications for families’budgets of slower growth
in premiums have been equally striking. Had premiums increased
since2010atthesamemeanrateastheprecedingdecade,themean
family premium for employer-based coverage would have been al-
most$2600higherin2015.33Employeesreceivemuchofthosesav-
ingsthroughlowerpremiumcosts,andeconomistsgenerallyagree
that those employees will receive the remainder as higher wages in
thelongrun.43Furthermore,whiledeductibleshaveincreasedinre-
cent years, they have increased no faster than in the years preced-
ing 2010.44 Multiple sources also indicate that the overall share of
health care costs that enrollees in employer coverage pay out of
pocket has been close to flat since 2010 (Figure 545-48), most likely
because the continued increase in deductibles has been canceled
out by a decline in co-payments.
At the same time, the United States has seen important im-
provementsinthequalityofcare.Therateofhospital-acquiredcon-
ditions (such as adverse drug events, infections, and pressure ul-
cers)hasdeclinedby17%,from145per1000dischargesin2010to

Medicare & Medicaid Services). The Department of Health and Hu-
man Services has estimated that lower hospital readmission rates
resulted in 565 000 fewer total readmissions from April 2010
through May 2015.50,51
While the Great Recession and other factors played a role in re-
cent trends, the Council of Economic Advisers has found evidence
thatthereformsintroducedbytheACAhelpedbothslowhealthcare

contribution of the ACA’
s reforms is likely to increase in the years
ahead as its tools are used more fully and as the models already de-
ployed under the ACA continue to mature.
Building on Progress to Date
I am proud of the policy changes in the ACA and the progress that
has been made toward a more affordable, high-quality, and acces-
sible health care system. Despite this progress, too many Ameri-
cansstillstraintopayfortheirphysicianvisitsandprescriptions,cover
their deductibles, or pay their monthly insurance bills; struggle to
navigateacomplex,sometimesbewilderingsystem;andremainun-
insured. More work to reform the health care system is necessary,
with some suggestions offered below.
First, many of the reforms introduced in recent years are still
someyearsfromreachingtheirmaximumeffect.Withrespecttothe
law’
s coverage provisions, these early years’experience demon-
stratethattheHealthInsuranceMarketplaceisaviablesourceofcov-
erageformillionsofAmericansandwillbefordecadestocome.How-
ever, both insurers and policy makers are still learning about the
dynamics of an insurance market that includes all people regard-
less of any preexisting conditions, and further adjustments and re-
calibrations will likely be needed, as can be seen in some insurers’
proposedMarketplacepremiumsfor2017.Inaddition,acriticalpiece

Withrespecttodeliverysystemreform,thereorientationofthe
US health care payment systems toward quality and accountability
hasmadesignificantstridesforward,butitwilltakecontinuedhard
work to achieve my administration’
s goal of having at least half of
traditional Medicare payments flowing through alternative pay-
ment models by the end of 2018. Tools created by the ACA—
includingCMMIandthelaw’
sACOprogram—andthenewtoolspro-
vided by MACRA will play central roles in this important work. In
parallel,Iexpectcontinuedbipartisansupportforidentifyingtheroot
causes and cures for diseases through the Precision Medicine and
BRAINinitiativesandtheCancerMoonshot,whicharelikelytohave
profound benefits for the 21st-century US health care system and
health outcomes.
Second, while the ACA has greatly improved the affordability
of health insurance coverage, surveys indicate that many of the re-
maining uninsured individuals want coverage but still report being
unable to afford it.53,54 Some of these individuals may be unaware
ofthefinancialassistanceavailableundercurrentlaw,whereasoth-
erswouldbenefitfromcongressionalactiontoincreasefinancialas-
sistance to purchase coverage, which would also help middle-class
families who have coverage but still struggle with premiums. The
steady-state cost of the ACA’
s coverage provisions is currently pro-
jected to be 28% below CBO’
s original projections, due in signifi-
cant part to lower-than-expected Marketplace premiums, so in-
creased financial assistance could make coverage even more
affordablewhilestillkeepingfederalcostsbelowinitialestimates.55,56
Third, more can and should be done to enhance competition in
the Marketplaces. For most Americans in most places, the Market-
places are working. The ACA supports competition and has encour-
agedtheentryofhospital-basedplans,Medicaidmanagedcareplans,
and other plans into new areas. As a result, the majority of the coun-
try has benefited from competition in the Marketplaces, with 88%

facturers are required to pay for drugs prescribed to certain Medi-
care and Medicaid beneficiaries, and to give the federal government
the authority to negotiate prices for certain high-priced drugs.63
There is another important role for Congress: it should avoid
movingbackwardonhealthreform.WhileIhavealwaysbeeninter-
estedinimprovingthelaw—andsigned19billsthatdojustthat—my
administration has spent considerable time in the last several years
opposing more than 60 attempts to repeal parts or all of the ACA,
time that could have been better spent working to improve our
health care system and economy. In some instances, the repeal ef-
forts have been bipartisan, including the effort to roll back the ex-
cise tax on high-cost employer-provided plans. Although this pro-
vision can be improved, such as through the reforms I proposed in
my budget, the tax creates strong incentives for the least-efficient
private-sector health plans to engage in delivery system reform ef-
forts,withmajorbenefitsfortheeconomyandthebudget.Itshould
be preserved.64 In addition, Congress should not advance legisla-
tion that undermines the Independent Payment Advisory Board,
which will provide a valuable backstop if rapid cost growth returns
to Medicare.
Lessons for Future Policy Makers
While historians will draw their own conclusions about the broader
implicationsoftheACA,Ihavemyown.Theselessonslearnedarenot
just for posterity: I have put them into practice in both health care
policy and other areas of public policy throughout my presidency.
Thefirstlessonisthatanychangeisdifficult,butitisespeciallydif-
ficultinthefaceofhyperpartisanship.Republicansreversedcourseand
rejectedtheirownideasoncetheyappearedinthetextofabillthatI
supported. For example, they supported a fully funded risk-corridor

inMassachusettsin2006butopposeditintheACA.Theysupported
theemployermandateinCaliforniain2007butopposeditintheACA—
andthenopposedtheadministration’
sdecisiontodelayit.Moreover,
through inadequate funding, opposition to routine technical correc-
tions,excessiveoversight,andrelentlesslitigation,Republicansunder-
mined ACA implementation efforts. We could have covered more
groundmorequicklywithcooperationratherthanobstruction.Itisnot
obviousthatthisstrategyhaspaidpoliticaldividendsforRepublicans,
but it has clearly come at a cost for the country, most notably for the
estimated 4 million Americans left uninsured because they live in
GOP-led states that have yet to expand Medicaid.65
The second lesson is that special interests pose a continued
obstacle to change. We worked successfully with some health care
organizations and groups, such as major hospital associations, to
redirect excessive Medicare payments to federal subsidies for the
uninsured. Yet others, like the pharmaceutical industry, oppose any
change to drug pricing, no matter how justifiable and modest,
because they believe it threatens their profits.66 We need to con-
tinue to tackle special interest dollars in politics. But we also need
to reinforce the sense of mission in health care that brought us an
affordable polio vaccine and widely available penicillin.
The third lesson is the importance of pragmatism in both legis-
lation and implementation. Simpler approaches to addressing our
healthcareproblemsexistatbothendsofthepoliticalspectrum:the
single-payermodelvsgovernmentvouchersforall.Yetthenationtypi-
cally reaches its greatest heights when we find common ground be-
tweenthepublicandprivategoodandadjustalongtheway.Thatwas
myapproachwiththeACA.WeengagedwithCongresstoidentifythe
combinationofprovenhealthreformideasthatcouldpassandhave
continued to adapt them since. This includes abandoning parts that
do not work, like the voluntary long-term care program included in
thelaw.Italsomeansshuttingdownandrestartingaprocesswhenit
fails. When HealthCare.gov did not work on day 1, we brought in re-
inforcements,werebrutallyhonestinassessingproblems,andworked
relentlesslytogetitoperating.Boththeprocessandthewebsitewere
successful, and we created a playbook we are applying to technol-
ogy projects across the government.
While the lessons enumerated above may seem daunting, the
ACAexperienceneverthelessmakesmeoptimisticaboutthiscoun-
try’
scapacitytomakemeaningfulprogressoneventhebiggestpub-
lic policy challenges. Many moments serve as reminders that a bro-
ken status quo is not the nation’
s destiny. I often think of a letter I
receivedfromBrentBrownofWisconsin.Hedidnotvoteformeand
heopposed“ObamaCare,”butBrentchangedhismindwhenhebe-
came ill, needed care, and got it thanks to the law.67 Or take Gover-
nor John Kasich’
s explanation for expanding Medicaid: “For those
that live in the shadows of life, those who are the least among us, I
will not accept the fact that the most vulnerable in our state should
be ignored. We can help them.”68 Or look at the actions of count-
less health care providers who have made our health system more
coordinated, quality-oriented, and patient-centered. I will repeat
what I said 4 years ago when the Supreme Court upheld the ACA: I
am as confident as ever that looking back 20 years from now, the
nation will be better off because of having the courage to pass this
law and persevere. As this progress with health care reform in the
United States demonstrates, faith in responsibility, belief in oppor-
tunity, and ability to unite around common values are what makes
this nation great.
