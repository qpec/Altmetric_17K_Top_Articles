Abstract
Recent studies have demonstrated that repeated short-term nutri-
ent withdrawal (i.e. fasting) has pleiotropic actions to promote
organismal health and longevity. Despite this, the molecular physi-
ological mechanisms by which fasting is protective against meta-
bolic disease are largely unknown. Here, we show that, metabolic
control, particularly systemic and liver lipid metabolism, is aber-
rantly regulated in the fasted state in mouse models of metabolic
dysfunction. Liver transcript assays between lean/healthy and
obese/diabetic mice in fasted and fed states uncovered “growth
arrest and DNA damage-inducible” GADD45b as a dysregulated
gene transcript during fasting in several models of metabolic
dysfunction including ageing, obesity/pre-diabetes and type 2
diabetes, in both mice and humans. Using whole-body knockout
mice as well as liver/hepatocyte-specific gain- and loss-of-function
strategies, we revealed a role for liver GADD45b in the coordination
of liver fatty acid uptake, through cytoplasmic retention of FABP1,
ultimately impacting obesity-driven hyperglycaemia. In summary,
fasting stress-induced GADD45b represents a liver-specific molecu-
lar event promoting adaptive metabolic function.

Introduction
The incidence of obesity is at an epidemic level worldwide and is a
strong risk factor for a number of ageing-related diseases including
type 2 diabetes (T2D), cardiovascular disease and the metabolic
syndrome, and thus poses a tremendous burden on quality of life
and health care systems worldwide (Popkin et al, 2012). Thus, there
is a desperate need for more effective strategies to curtail this trend,
whether through prescription of behavioural or pharmacological
treatments.
A hallmark of obesity-driven T2D is insulin resistance (Bjorntorp,
1997), and thus, much effort is placed into treatments that promote
“insulin sensitisation” (Connor et al, 2015). While there is no doubt
that insulin is an important mediator of metabolic control in the
prandial state (Boucher et al, 2014), insulin resistance likely repre-
sents a physiological feedback mechanism to actually retard the
development of obesity-driven complications (Hoehn et al, 2009),
prompting speculation that “insulin sensitisation” may be a flawed
strategy (Connor et al, 2015). This is exemplified by studies demon-
strating that tissue-restricted loss of function of key insulin signal-
ling nodes actually extends health span of mice (Bluher et al, 2003;
Taguchi et al, 2007) and that insulin per se can promote the progres-
sion of obesity-related metabolic dysfunction (Mehran et al 2012).
Thus, alternative strategies are warranted, such as mild and inter-
mittent activation of stress-responsive pathways that are pro-
adaptive (Ristow & Zarse, 2010; Kolb & Eizirik, 2012).
One such strategy could be intermittent nutrient withdrawal.
Nutrient withdrawal (i.e. fasting) is protective against modern
chronic diseases such as cancer, neurodegeneration, cardiovascular
disease and diabetes (Longo & Mattson, 2014). In particular, a
recent study demonstrated that across multiple species including
humans, a periodic diet that mimics fasting had a positive effect on
lifespan and biomarkers of cognitive, immune and cardiometabolic
function (Brandhorst et al, 2015). Concerning metabolic function,
although it is known that there are several systemic adaptive
changes in metabolism with nutrient withdrawal (Cahill, 2006),
little is known of the tissue-specific molecular mechanisms by
which fasting can improve organismal metabolic control and retard
the development of metabolic disease (Longo & Mattson, 2014).
Although it is well accepted that the liver is a pivotal organ
contributing to metabolic control (van den Berghe, 1991), whether

 the liver actually contributes in many aspects of metabolic control
during fasting, and molecular mechanisms therein, remains largely
unknown. It is known that the liver is the primary site of glucose
production and can provide alternate substrates such as ketone
bodies under fasting conditions (van den Berghe, 1991). Interest-
ingly, the liver transcriptome starvation response correlates with
lifespan prolonging processes (Bauer et al, 2004) and it is hypothe-
sised that resistance to stress is an important determinant of
survival and longevity (Calabrese et al, 2011). Hence, one strategy
to uncover the molecular mechanisms contributing to metabolic
dysfunction could be to dissect the liver transcriptome to uncover
select genes which are aberrantly regulated during fasting. To this
end, our studies here identify a member of the “growth arrest and
DNA damage-inducible” (GADD45) gene family, namely GADD45b,
as one such gene. Importantly, there are no studies that have
systematically examined the role of GADD45b in metabolic function
in vivo, and here, we demonstrate that liver GADD45b acutely regu-
lates fatty acid handling under fasting stress, ultimately coordinating
proper metabolic function under conditions of chronic nutrient
oversupply.
Results
An altered lipid profile in mouse models of metabolic dysfunction
is most pronounced in the fasted state
To examine the molecular bases of metabolic (dys)regulation during
fasted and fed states, we required suitable mouse models. To this
end, we examined mouse models of obesity (Kanasaki & Koya,
2011) including the obese/diabetic db/db mouse (Figs 1A–E and
EV1A–D), pre-diabetic young New Zealand Obese mice (Figs 1F–N
and EV1E–H) and aged mice (Figs 1K–O and EV1I–L). In particular,
we subjected these mouse models to a fasting-refeeding regimen
and could demonstrate heightened blood glucose (BG; Fig EV1A, E
and I) most prominent in the fed and but also in the fasted state. In
contrast, although there was evidence of higher serum non-esteri-
fied fatty acids (NEFA; Fig 1A, F and K) in the fed state, surprisingly
these levels were lower in models of metabolic dysfunction in the
fasted state. This pattern was also reflected in the level of triglyc-
erides (TG; Fig 1B, G and L), ketone bodies (KB; Fig 1G, H and M)
as well as medium-chain (MCAC; Fig 1D, I and N) and long-chain
(LCAC; Fig 1E, J and O) acylcarnitines, with only mild differences
in free- (Fig EV1B, F and J), acyl- (Fig EV1C, G and K) and short-
chain (SCAC; Fig EV1D, H and L) acylcarnitines.
We then examined liver-specific metabolic control in a separate
cohort using ex vivo liver metabolic tracing. In particular, long-chain
fatty acid (LCFA) uptake was higher in the fasted state, and this was
exacerbated in db/db mice (Fig 1P). The higher fasting LCFA uptake
in WT mice was largely explained by higher LCFA oxidation
(Fig 1Q). However, in the db/db mice, the heightened LCFA oxida-
tion could not account for the higher uptake rate, meaning that non-
oxidative LCFA disposal was enhanced. We examined incorporation
into lipids but this was unchanged (data not shown). As fatty acids
can indirectly affect hepatic glucose production (Ross et al, 1967),
we examined liver glucose output, and indeed, it was higher in
db/db mice, particularly in the presence of exogenous NEFA
(Appendix Fig S1).
Taken together, our preliminary studies exemplify that systemic
lipid metabolism is particularly disturbed in the fasted state in mice
with metabolic dysfunction, with either enhanced clearance or
reduced production of systemic NEFA and TG, the former of which
might be explained by a liver-specific mechanism. Thus, our subse-
quent studies were focussed on the discovery of a molecular control
point regulating (mal)adaptive lipid metabolism during fasting.
Liver GADD45b is an inflexibly regulated gene transcript upon
fasting stress in multiple mouse models of metabolic dysfunction
Previous studies of metabolic tissue transcriptomes in rodents
(Bauer et al, 2004; Sokolovic et al, 2008; Hakvoort et al, 2011;
Zhang et al, 2011; Schupp et al, 2013) identified members of the
Gadd45 gene family potently affected by fasting stress. Given that
there are three members of the GADD45 family, we then decided to
take a targeted approach to the discovery of novel molecular regula-
tory mechanisms, and examine the expression of all members in
multiple models of metabolic dysfunction. To this end, we examined
mRNA expression in the liver from the db/db mice (Fig 2A–C) and
observed an upregulation of Gadd45b (~12-fold; Fig 2B) and
Gadd45g (~sevenfold; Fig 2C), which was largely blunted in the
liver of db/db mice; with only mild regulation of Gadd45a (Fig 2A).
Furthermore, we employed less severe models of metabolic dysfunc-
tion such as a monogenic model of obesity-driven pre-diabetes
(Kanasaki & Koya, 2011), the young ob/ob mouse (data not shown),
a polygenic model of obesity-driven pre-diabetes, the young New
Zealand Obese mouse (NZO; Fig 2D–F) and aged mice (Fig 2G–I).
In these models, we could observe a consistent pattern of regulation
of Gadd45b (Fig 2A, E and H), but not Gadd45g (Fig 2C, F and I),
with again only mild regulation of Gadd45a (Fig 2A, D and G).
Importantly, similar to the Gadd45b mRNA, which we could show
Figure 1.
The dysregulated lipid metabolic phenotype of mouse models of metabolic dysfunction is most pronounced in the fasted state.

Male 12-weeks-old wild-type (WT; C57Bl/6J) or obese/diabetic monogenic (db/db; BKS.Cg-m+/+ Lepr DB/J; n = 4/group, A–E), New Zealand Black (NZB) and
polygenic obese/pre-diabetic New Zealand Obese (NZO; n = 4/group; F–J), as well as young (i.e. 3 months) and aged (i.e. 22 months; n = 5/group; K–O),
mice were fed ad libitum (fed) or fasted for 24 h (fasted). Serum non-esterified fatty acids (A, F, K), triglycerides (B, G, L) and ketone bodies (C, H, M) were
measured. In addition, serum acylcarnitine profiling was conducted and medium-chain (D, I, N) and long-chain (E, J, O) acylcarnitine concentrations are
shown.

In another cohort of mice, ex vivo long-chain fatty acid (LCFA) metabolism, including uptake (P), oxidation (Q) and non-oxidative LCFA disposal (NOFAD; R), in
precision-cut liver slices from fed and fasted WT and db/db mice (n = 3/group; 4 slices per mouse), were determined. In addition, in slices from fasted mice, glucose
output was determined in the presence of incubation with NEFA (BSA-NEFA) or vehicle (BSA) (S).

 is dynamically regulated upon fasting and refeeding (Appendix Fig
S1A), we could observe a similar pattern of upregulation of
GADD45b protein in the liver of fasted mice, which was absent in
the liver of models of metabolic dysfunction (Fig 2J–L). In addition,
although we could show mild differential regulation in perigonadal
white adipose tissue (pgWAT; Appendix Fig S1B–D), brown adipose
tissue (BAT; Appendix Fig S1E–G) and gastrocnemius complex
skeletal
muscle
(GCM;
Appendix

of
Gadd45a
(Appendix Fig S1B, E and H), Gadd45b (Appendix Fig S1C, F and I)
and Gadd45g (Appendix Fig S1D, G and J) between fed and fasted
states comparing lean and obese/T2D mice, none of these regula-
tions were as striking as observed with the liver Gadd45b (Fig 2).
GADD45b affects metabolic regulation under conditions of
heightened lipid metabolism
Given that we could observe a stark regulation of liver GADD45b
under fasting stress, we next tested whether GADD45b expression/
activity affects the ability of the organism to handle such nutritional
stress by subjecting whole-body GADD45b knockout mice to starva-
tion and refeeding. In particular, absolute levels as well as changes
in body mass (Fig EV2A), food intake (Fig EV2B) and physical
activity (Fig EV2C) were unaffected in GADD45b KO mice. Further-
more, systemic oxidative metabolism, as reflected at the rate of O2
consumption (Fig 3A), CO2 production (Fig 3B) and respiratory
exchange ratio (Fig 3C), was also unaffected. In a separate study,
we could demonstrate that there was no compensatory upregulation
of the other GADD45 family members with loss of GADD45b
(Fig EV2D) and could confirm the lack of effect of GADD45b loss on
body mass regulation upon starvation (Fig EV2E). When we exam-
ined the masses of selected metabolic organs/tissues, there were
also no differences (Fig EV2F). On the other hand, while we could
not observe any differences in selected liver metabolites (Fig EV3G)
or blood serum levels of glucose (Fig EV2H), TG (Fig 3D), ketone
bodies (Fig 3E), glycerol (Fig EV2I) and acylcarnitines (Fig EV2J),
we could observe a significantly lower increase in serum NEFA
(Fig 3F) with a much higher level of accumulation of TG (~twofold;
Fig 3G) in the liver of GADD45b KO mice, pointing to a role for
GADD45b in coordinating an aspect of systemic lipid metabolism
under starvation stress. Importantly, even though we could observe
changes in Gadd45c upon starvation (Fig 2), there was no discern-
ible differential metabolic phenotype in starved GADD45c KO mice
(Appendix Fig S2).
Given that we could detect changes in lipid metabolism during
starvation, we next directly tested lipid homoeostasis by conducting
an oral lipid tolerance test. Strikingly, systemic lipid clearance was
accelerated in fasted GADD45b KO mice, with substantially lower
serum TG (Fig 3H) and NEFA (Fig 3I). Perhaps surprisingly, blood
glucose levels rose to a greater extent in the GADD45b KO mice
following oral lipid provision (Fig 3J), indicating that GADD45b
might be a molecular regulator of lipid–glucose metabolic crosstalk.
To test this further, we conducted a chronic high-fat diet (HFD)
study, which should then reveal whether GADD45b is operative in
affecting metabolic control during more mild but chronic fasting-
feeding rhythms, and while there were no substantial effects of
GADD45b loss on glucose homoeostasis on the normal-fat diet (NFD),
there was impaired glucose homoeostasis upon high-fat diet treatment
as demonstrated by intraperitoneal insulin tolerance testing (ipITT;
Fig 3K) as well as fasting glucose (BG; Fig 3J), insulin (Fig 3M) and
a calculated insulin resistance index (HOMA-IR; Fig 3N), which
were independent of compensatory GADD45 expression, body and
liver mass in the ad libitum fed state (Appendix Fig S3).
Liver GADD45b modulates metabolic regulation under conditions
of heightened lipid metabolism
We next wanted to test whether liver-specific GADD45b affects
systemic metabolism. Indeed, we could demonstrate that similar to
the lipid tolerance test results (Fig 3C and D), ex vivo liver lipid
handling is affected by GADD45b loss (Fig 4A–D), selectively in the
fasted state when Gadd45b is upregulated (Fig 2). In particular,
long-chain fatty acid uptake was enhanced (LCFA; Fig 4A), without
effects on LCFA oxidation (Fig 4B), and thus largely driven by an
enhanced non-oxidative metabolism (NOFAD; Fig 4C). Similar to
the exaggerated glycemic response to oral lipid (Fig 3E), the glucose
production rate from liver ex vivo was exacerbated by GADD45b
loss (Fig 4D), highlighting a potential role of GADD45b in coordinat-
ing proper liver fatty acid–glucose metabolism crosstalk.
To examine whether the upregulation of Gadd45b mRNA during
fasting was occurring within the parenchymal cell of the liver,
namely the hepatocyte, we performed a liver cell-type fractionation
experiment from livers of fasted and fed mice. While the fractiona-
tion of hepatocytes leaked into the non-parenchymal fraction to a
mild extent (Alb; Fig EV3A), the hepatocyte fraction was devoid of
non-parenchymal markers of endothelial (Cd31; Fig EV3B), stellate
(Des; Fig EV3C) and Kupffer (Emr1; Fig EV3D) cells, and there was
only an upregulation of Gadd45b in the hepatocyte fraction (Fig 4E),
indicating that the increase of Gadd45b expression within the liver
upon fasting occurs within the hepatocyte.
Given the above findings, we then wanted to assess whether
GADD45b affects metabolic control in a liver-specific manner
in vivo. As such, we conducted a study whereby we silenced

Liver GADD45b and metabolism

 Gadd45b in a liver/hepatocyte selective manner (Graham et al,
2008; Rose et al, 2011) via AAV-mediated delivery of a Gadd45b-
specific miRNA. Using this strategy, we were able to substantially
blunt
the
expression
of
Gadd45b,
particularly
during
fasting
(Fig EV3E). Similar to the results from the germline whole-body KO
(Fig 3), there was a blunting of the higher serum NEFA (Fig 4F) and
exacerbation of the higher liver TG (Fig 4G) in the fasted liver-
specific Gadd45b silenced mice. To confirm that hepatic GADD45b
affects lipid metabolism, we conducted a study whereby we overex-
pressed GADD45b in the liver in GADD45b KO mice (Fig EV3F).
Indeed, GADD45b re-introduction into the liver of whole-body
GADD45b KO, despite not affecting serum NEFA (Fig EV3G),
affected serum TG (Fig EV3H) and alleviated the heightened accu-
mulation of TG in the liver of GADD45b KO mice upon fasting
(Fig 4H). To test this further, we conducted a chronic high-fat diet
(HFD) study, which should then reveal whether GADD45b is opera-
tive in affecting metabolic control during more mild but chronic fast-
ing-feeding rhythms. While there were no substantial effects of
GADD45b loss on biometric parameters (Fig EV3I–K), similar to the
whole-body KO study (Fig 3), hepatocyte-specific GADD45b silenc-
ing worsened the progression of insulin resistance upon high-fat
diet-induced obesity (Fig 4I–K).
Impaired liver GADD45b expression correlates with metabolic
dysfunction in obesity-driven type 2 diabetes in mouse and man
Prompted by our results that GADD45b loss can affect glucose
homoeostasis in obesity (Figs 3 and 4), we tested whether restora-
tion of liver GADD45b can improve metabolic homoeostasis in type
2 diabetes. To this end, we employed our prior strategy and overex-
pressed GADD45b in the liver of obese/diabetic db/db mice
(Fig EV4A). While biometrics (Fig EV4B–D) were not drastically
affected, fasting blood glucose (Fig 5A) and insulin (Fig 5B) were
lower in diabetic mice, which led to an overall reduction in systemic
insulin resistance (HOMA-IR; Fig 5C). Since GADD45b expression in
liver affects lipid and glucose homoeostasis in mice, we wondered if
the same were true in humans. Indeed, during fasting, GADD45B
expression was significantly lower in livers of type-2 diabetic
patients (T2D) when compared with aged-matched individuals with
normal glucose tolerance (NGT; Fig 5D). Furthermore, although
there was a non-significant negative correlation with HOMA-IR
(Fig EV4E), liver GADD45B expression negatively correlated with
fasting TG (Fig 5E) and glucose (FPG; Fig 5F) levels. Hence, similar
to mice, effective GADD45B expression during fasting may also
confer proper metabolic control in humans.
Liver GADD45b controls liver fatty acid handling by cytosolic
FABP1 retention
Given the effects of GADD45b on metabolism, we then searched for
a mechanism by which it might exert such control. Given that prior
studies have demonstrated a role for GADD45b to control various
aspects of cellular functions though transcriptional or signalling
mechanisms we first focussed on this. In particular, overexpression
of GADD45b in the livers of diabetic mice did not enhance key
insulin signalling nodes (Fig EV5A and B). Furthermore, although
previously implicated in other studies (Keil et al, 2013; Tian &
Locker, 2013), GADD45b expression did not affect autophagy,
mTORC1, MAPK or ER stress signalling pathways (Fig EV5C and
D). Nor did GADD45b (Fig 6A) affect expression of key genes
involved in liver fatty acid transport/metabolism at the mRNA
(Fig 6B) or protein (Fig EV5C and D) level. Consistent with a role
for localisation of key FA transport/handling proteins in metabolic
control (Glatz et al, 2002; Kazantzis & Stahl, 2012), we could,
however, observe a role for GADD45b in regulating FABP1, but not
FATP2 nor CD36, localisation (Fig 6C). In particular, FABP1 locali-
sation was redistributed from the cytoplasm to the low-density
microsomal (i.e. plasma membrane and microsomes) membranes
with a lack of GADD45b (Figs 6C and D, and EV5E), which could be
reversed by re-expression of GADD45b in a liver-specific manner
(Fig 6E). Furthermore, similar to the liver of GADD45b knockout
mice, obese/diabetic db/db mice had a redistribution of FABP1
towards microsomes and away from the cytosol, which could be
reversed by GADD45B overexpression (Fig 6F).
Given that immunoprecipitation experiments demonstrated that
GADD45b can physically bind in a complex with FABP1 (Fig 6G)
and that GADD45b is exclusively expressed in the cytoplasm
(Fig 6C), GADD45b might operate as a cytosolic adapter molecule
for FABP1. Lastly, expression of GADD45b and associated altered
localisation of FABP1 consistently negatively correlated with liver
levels of activated long-chain fatty acids in multiple experiments
(Fig 6H–J), consistent with a direct role for GADD45b to modulate
hepatocellular FA metabolism.
Discussion
Here, we demonstrate that liver GADD45b expression is dynami-
cally regulated upon fasting stress, perhaps by increased oxidative
stress (Zhang et al, 2013; Kim et al, 2014), where it aids in the coor-
dination of liver lipid metabolism, by limiting hepatocellular fatty
acid (FA) uptake via cytosolic FABP1 retention. Furthermore, in
mouse and human metabolic dysfunction such as type 2 diabetes,
obesity/pre-diabetes and the aged, liver GADD45b expression is
dysregulated
thereby
contributing
to
aberrant
lipid/glucose
homoeostasis.
The GADD45 gene family composes of three structurally and
functionally related genes named as GADD45a, GADD45b and
GADD45c, encoding small, highly acidic, nuclear proteins (Lieber-
mann & Hoffman, 2002). Depending on the cellular stress and the
physical interactions with other proteins, GADD45 proteins serve as
stress sensors, which participate in cell cycle arrest, apoptosis and
cell survival (Liebermann & Hoffman, 2008). Despite their structural
and physical similarities, their response to stress conditions is cell
type and stimulus specific (Yang et al, 2009). Indeed, similar to
prior studies (Bauer et al, 2004; Zhang et al, 2011), here, we could
show that fasting preferentially promotes GADD45b expression in
the liver, whereas others have demonstrated that physical exertion
(Hoene & Weigert, 2010), cold stress (Gantner et al, 2014) and atro-
phy (Ebert et al, 2012) activated GADD45 isoform expression in
other diverse metabolic tissues, with functional metabolic effects.
Furthermore, there are several lines of evidence that GADD45b is
involved in hyperplasia of hepatocytes in liver regeneration (Colum-
bano et al, 2005; Papa et al, 2008; Tian et al, 2011), and although
hepatic TG accumulation occurs during liver regeneration, the
effects GADD45b on lipid metabolism identified here are unlikely to

 be of relevance in this setting (Newberry et al, 2008). Even though
GADD45b has been linked to epigenetic control (Ma et al 2009), it is
unlikely that the altered metabolism observed within GADD45b
knockout mice results from developmental “programming” as we
could show congruent phenotypes when GADD45b was manipu-
lated in adult mice.
Through
liver-specific
GADD45b
manipulation
in
vivo,
we
demonstrated that the altered liver fatty acid metabolism in obesity/
diabetes and ageing might result from altered liver GADD45b
expression, particularly during the fasted state. In particular, fasted
obese/T2D mice had enhanced liver LCFA uptake, with a similar
phenotype observed in fasted GADD45b KO mice, suggesting that
the blunted regulation of liver GADD45b and metabolic derange-
ments in mouse models of metabolic dysfunction may be causally
linked. We speculate that the persistent fast-feeding cycles intermit-
tently activate liver GADD45b expression, leading to proper coordi-
nation of liver lipid metabolism during fasting, ultimately impacting
the maintenance of metabolic health, particularly when dietary
lipid/nutrient intake is high. Indeed, liver lipid metabolism is inti-
mately linked to systemic glucose control (Perry et al, 2015).
While it is conceivable that GADD45b could achieve its effects via
both cell-autonomous and non-autonomous mechanisms, we could
demonstrate that GADD45b modulates LCFA metabolism ex vivo,
indicating that the former is likely to be the case, and that factors
within hepatocytes per se are likely to be affected by GADD45b. In
particular, unlike other studies that have shown a role for the activa-
tion of transcriptional co-activator PGC1a to retard metabolic
dysfunction by promoting fatty acid oxidation (Morris et al, 2012),
we could demonstrate that fasting liver LCFA oxidation was not
affected, but rather non-oxidative FA metabolism independent of
storage was involved in GADD45b-mediated effects on hepatic lipid
metabolism. This is reminiscent of studies of skeletal muscle, where
an unknown FA metabolic fate correlates with obesity-related meta-
bolic dysfunction (Koves et al, 2008), and probably relates to a rela-
tive mitochondrial substrate “overload” (Muoio & Neufer, 2012),
which seems to be also present in the liver (Satapati et al, 2012).

 Furthermore, chronically enhanced liver FA supply/uptake can nega-
tively affect systemic metabolic function (Mittelman et al, 1997;

could demonstrate that induced GADD45b restrained liver fatty acid
uptake during fasting ultimately preventing an accumulation of
long-chain (LC) acyl-CoAs in the liver. Given that liver LC-acyl-CoAs
levels positively correlate with insulin resistance (present work and
(Chen et al, 1992; Kamath et al, 2011), they may be directly or indi-
rectly related to aberrant glucose metabolism under conditions of

 1997; Cooney et al, 2002; Li et al, 2010). Indeed, here we observed
that restoration of low liver GADD45b expression in obese/diabetic
mice reduced the higher liver LC-acyl-CoA amount in liver, which
correlated with improved glucose homoeostasis.
Here, we demonstrate that GADD45b binds to and restrains
FABP1 to the hepatocyte cytoplasmic compartment, ultimately
preventing an accumulation of activated long-chain fatty acids.
Importantly, although normally heavily abundant in the cytoplasm,
redistribution of FABP1 has been described previously in other
contexts (Wolfrum et al, 2001; Antonenkov et al, 2006). Consistent
with a key role for FABP1 localisation in explaining the altered FA
metabolism modulated by GADD45b expression, FABP1 is a highly
abundant protein in the liver which has a role in cellular uptake of
FAs and affects the development of insulin resistance in obesity
(Atshaves et al, 2010). In particular, in vitro gain- and loss-of-func-
tion studies (Wolfrum et al, 2001; Linden et al, 2002; Newberry
et al, 2003) have implicated FABP1 in hepatocellular FA uptake,
and studies of germline FABP1 knockout mice demonstrate reduced
hepatic FA uptake particularly during conditions of heightened FA
supply such as fasting (Martin et al, 2003; Newberry et al, 2003),
which is consistent with our studies here. Thus, we hypothesise that
aberrant localisation of FABP1 towards microsomal membranes,
including the surface membranes and microsomes, is a molecular
event linking excess hepatic fatty acid uptake and low GADD45b
expression during fasting.
Of note, the aberrant lipid metabolic phenotype, including serum
NEFA, triglycerides, ketone bodies, acylcarnitines and liver triglyc-
erides, of obese/aged mice was particularly observed in the fasted
state, which corresponds to studies in humans demonstrating that
differential metabolic phenotypes are best revealed by challenges
(Krug et al, 2012). In flies, D-GADD45 overexpression results in
increased longevity, and a hallmark of long-lived animals is resis-
tance to stressors (Calabrese et al, 2011). Indeed, we (data not
shown) and others (Kim et al, 2015) have demonstrated that
GADD45b protects against liver damage upon toxicity stress and fast-
ing activates pleiotropic adaptive processes that are beneficial to
organismal health (Longo & Mattson, 2014). Given that liver toxicity
response is exacerbated in obese/diabetic mice (Aubert et al, 2012),
of which have dysregulated GADD45b expression, the coordination
of metabolism by GADD45b may represent of molecular metabolic
link in adaptive stress biology. Taken together, we hypothesise that
GADD45b might represent a “vitagene” conferring hormetic meta-
bolic adaptive processes (Calabrese et al, 2011), and that the concept
of “metabolic inflexibility” (Storlien et al, 2004) may simply reflect a
lack of response of such hormetic mechanisms (Kolb & Eizirik,
2012), of which liver GADD45b induction may be one component.
In summary, here, we identify a role of a liver transcript, GADD45b,
in modulating systemic and liver-specific adaptive metabolism under
nutrient-starvation stress, which ultimately aids in the coordination of
metabolic homoeostasis upon chronic nutrient overload.
Materials and Methods
Mouse experiments
Mouse strains used included male wild-type C57Bl/6J (000664;
Charles
River
Laboratories,
DEU),
db/db
(12 weeks;
000642,
BKS.Cg-m+

(7 weeks; 000632, B6.Cg-Lepob/J, Jackson Laboratories, USA), New
Zealand Black (7 weeks; NZB/BlNJ, 000993, Jackson Laboratories,
USA) and New Zealand Obese (7 weeks; NZO/HlLtJ, 002105, Jack-
son Laboratories, USA). Furthermore, germline male GADD45b
(B6.CgGADD45btm1Daa;
Gupta
et al,
2005)
and
female
(XX)
GADD45c (B6.CgGADD45ctm1Mhol; Cai et al, 2006) knockout mice
from �/
+ × �/
+ crossings were used. Importantly, SNP marker test-
ing demonstrated that the GADD45b mouse line was of 99.1% pure
C57Bl/6 background strain (Charles River Genetic Testing Services;
data not shown). The animals were housed according to interna-
tional standard conditions with a 12-h dark–light cycle and regular
unrestricted diet with free access to water if not stated otherwise.
For studies with overexpression of GADD45b in the murine liver,
1 × 109 infectious units per recombinant adenovirus (AD) were
administered via tail vein injection into either male db/db and
C57Bl/6J control mice or GADD45b WT and KO littermates 1 week
after acclimation on control diet, all at the age of 12 weeks. Another
week later, mice were fasted for 24 h before sacrifice. In other stud-
ies, hepatocyte-specific GADD45b knockdown was accompanied
with fasting or HFD treatments. After 1 week of acclimation on
control diet, at the age of 9 weeks, 2 × 1011 virus particles per
adeno-associated virus (AAV) were administered via tail vein injec-
tion into male C57Bl/6J mice. The fasting study was carried out,
half the mice from each virus group either fed ad libitum or were
subjected for fasting for 24 h. For the HFD study, 1 week after virus
administration, half of the animals switched to HFD and studied for
further 16 weeks. Inclusion criteria were mice of a certain age (i.e.
9–12 weeks at the beginning of the experiment. Criteria for exclu-
sion of mice from study groups were obvious infections/wounds
which would impact on feeding behaviour as well as metabolic pro-
file. These criteria were pre-established. Animal experiments were
conducted according to local, national and EU ethical guidelines and
approved by local regulatory authorities (Regierungspra
¨sidium
Karlsruhe, DEU) and conformed to ARRIVE guidelines.
Metabolic phenotyping
For starvation experiments, mice were placed in fresh cages and
food was withdrawn while maintain access to drinking water for
24 h from ZT1. For all GADD45 experiments, a control diet
(Research diets D12450B, New Brunswick, USA) was used, and
experiments were conducted after at least 1-week adaptation to the
diet. To study diet-induced obesity, a high-fat diet was used
(Research diets D12492, New Brunswick, USA). For comprehensive
metabolic/behavioural phenotyping, the TSE Phenomaster system
was used that permits automated and simultaneous monitoring of
indirect calorimetry, body mass, food and water intake and 3D
activity of individually housed mice (Tschop et al, 2012). Mice were
acclimated to the system 4 days prior to the initiation of the experi-
ments. For standard experiments, blood was taken after cervical
dislocation and organs including liver, adipose tissue depots and
gastrocnemius muscles were collected, weighed, snap-frozen in
liquid nitrogen and stored at �80°C until further analysis.
To study the dynamics of systemic metabolism, we performed
tolerance tests according to established guidelines (Ayala et al,
2010). In particular, we performed an intraperitoneal insulin (1 IU/kg;
Huminsulin Normal, DEU) tolerance test in the 5–6 h fasted state

the 5–6 h fasted state (ZT6-7) for assessment of blood glucose and
serum insulin levels for the calculation of HOMA-IR ((glucose
(mM) × insulin (pM))/3857), which is a good surrogate measure of
whole-body insulin action in mice (Lee et al, 2008). To assess tissue-
specific insulin signalling, mice were fasted for 6 h, then insulin
(Huminsulin, Lilly) was injected (10 mU/g body weight) and 15 min
later, liver tissue was rapidly harvested and frozen in LN2 following
euthanisation by cervical dislocation (Agouni et al, 2010).
Human subjects
Liver tissue samples were obtained from 37 Caucasian lean and
obese men, 14 with and 23 without type 2 diabetes, who underwent
open abdominal surgery for Roux-en-Y bypass, sleeve gastrectomy
or elective cholecystectomy. Liver biopsy was taken during the
surgery, immediately frozen in liquid nitrogen and stored at �80°C
until further use. The phenotypic characterisation of the cohort has
been performed as described previously (Kloting et al, 2010). Serum
samples and liver biopsies were taken between 8 am and 10 am
after an overnight fast. The study was approved by the local ethics
committee of the University of Leipzig, Germany (363-10-13122010
and 017-12-230112). All patients gave preoperative written informed
consent for the use of their samples.
Blood metabolites & hormones
Blood glucose levels were determined using an automatic glucose
monitor (One Touch, LifeScan). In addition, commercially available
kits were used to measure serum non-esterified fatty acids (NEFA;
NEFA-HR,
Wako),
glycerol/triglyceride
(TG;
TR-0100;
Sigma-
Aldrich), ketone bodies (KB; Autokit 3-HB, Wako), cholesterol
(CH200, Randox) and insulin (80-INSMS-E01, Alpco) essentially
according to manufacturer’s instructions. All samples were loaded
in order to fit within the assay range of the reagents supplied. Acyl-
carnitines were determined in serum by electrospray ionisation
tandem mass spectrometry (ESI-MS/MS) according to a modified
method as previously described (Sauer et al, 2006), using a Quattro
Ultima triple quadrupole mass spectrometer (Micromass, Manch-
ester, UK) equipped with an electrospray ion source and a Micro-
mass MassLynx data system.
Tissue metabolite extraction and assay
For
tissue
lipid
determinations,
frozen
tissue
samples
were
pulverised, weighed and extracted. Lipid analyses were conducted
according to established guidelines (Argmann et al, 2006) using
glycerol/triglyceride (TR-0100; Sigma-Aldrich), NEFA (NEFA-HR,
Wako) and cholesterol (CH200, Randox) assay kits. For liver glyco-
gen determination, ~50 mg of liver powder was carefully weighed
and extracted in 30% KOH followed by 70% ethanol precipitation.
Resuspended glycogen was digested with amyloglucosidase (A7095,
Sigma-Aldrich, DEU) and glycogen digests were then assayed using a
glucose assay kit (GAHK20, Sigma-Aldrich, DEU). Liver tissue long-
chain acyl-CoA species were extracted (Golovko & Murphy, 2004)
and measured using an enzymatic assay (Barber & Lands, 1971).
Values were calculated as molar concentration per gram wet tissue.
Ex vivo long-chain fatty acid metabolism
These experiments were carried out on precision-cut liver slices (de
Graaf et al, 2010) according to established guidelines for long-chain
fatty acid (LCFA) metabolism experiments (Watt et al, 2012). In
particular, liver slices were taken and prepared (in absence of
Insulin and Dexamethasone) from fed or fasted mice and pre-
incubated in Williams media E containing 50 lg/ml gentamycin,
5% dialysed FBS, 5 mM
D-glucose, 0.3 mM pyruvate, 0.1 lM
methyl-linoleate and an amino acid mixture resembling the hepatic
portal vein concentrations (Patti et al, 1998). After 1 h, slices were
then incubated with the same media containing 0.5 mM carnitine
and BSA-conjugated palmitic acid (50 lM) plus BSA-conjugated
oleic and linoleic acid mix (150 lM; L9655, Sigma-Aldrich), repre-
senting the major (i.e. 67%) LCFA species in blood serum (Masood
et al, 2005) together with trace amounts of [9,10-3H(N)]-palmitic
acid (ART0129; American Radiolabeled Chemicals, USA), to trace
LCFA metabolism, and [1-14C]-R-2-bromopalmitic acid (ARC3623;
American
Radiolabeled
Chemicals,
USA),
a
non-metabolisable
palmitate analogue (Oakes et al, 1999) to trace LCFA uptake. Incu-
bations were conducted for 3 h after which media was collected and
slices were washed in ice-cold PBS, spot-dried and snap-frozen in
LN2. Liver slice samples were homogenised in Solvable
TM (Perki-
nElmer, DEU) and media were extracted (twice) according to Folch
method (Folch et al, 1957) in order to count only the aqueous
3H2O reflecting FA oxidation. Samples were then analysed by
dual-dpm counting (Packard 2200CA Tri-Carb Liquid Scintillation
analyzer; Packard Instruments, USA) using multi-purpose scintil-
lant (Rotiszint� eco plus, Carl-Roth, DEU), and LCFA metabolism
was calculated based upon the media tracer:tracee ratio (dpm/
mol). Non-oxidative LCFA disposal (NOFAD) rate was calculated
as the difference between LCFA uptake and oxidation rates. In
addition, liver slices from the same mice were allowed to incu-
bate in media described above without glucose but with (BSA-
NEFA) or without (fatty acid-free BSA vehicle) for 18 h and
glucose concentration of the media was measured (GAHK20,
Sigma-Aldrich, DEU) and subsequently glucose production rate
was calculated.
Plasmids, RNA interference and recombinant viruses
AAV encoding control or specific miRNAs under the control of a
hepatocyte-specific promoter were established, purified and tittered
as described previously (Graham et al, 2008; Rose et al, 2011). For
miRNA experiments, oligonucleotides targeting mouse GADD45b
(50- GGCGGCCAAACTGATGAATGT -30) and non-specific oligonu-
cleotides (50-AAATGTACTGCGCGTGGAGAC-30) were cloned into
pcDNA6.2-GW/EmGFP-miR [“BLOCK-iT

 purified were purified by the caesium chloride method and dialysed
against phosphate-buffered saline buffer containing 10% glycerol
prior to animal injection.
Tissue RNA/protein extraction and analysis
Liver cell fractionation was performed using a simplified method
adapted from Jiang and colleagues (Liu et al, 2011). Liver organelle
fractionation was conducted via density-based separation (Cox &
Emili, 2006). RNA was extracted from tissues using Qiazol and
cDNA synthesised using the First Strand cDNA synthesis kit (Fer-
mentas, DEU). Quantitative PCR was conducted using Taqman
master mix and Taqman primer-probe assays (Life Technologies,
DEU). Tissue protein extraction and immunoblotting was performed
using standard methods using GADD45b (sc-8776), FATP2 (sc-
161311), FABP1 (sc-50380), HNF4a (sc-6556), BCKDE1A (sc-67200),
NTCP (sc-98485) and ARG1 (sc-21050) (Santa-Cruz Biotechnology,
DEU); LC3B (2275), pT39-S6K1 (9205), p-ERK (9101), p-p38 (9211),
p-eIF2a (9721) and GRP78 (3183) (Cell Signaling Technologies,
USA); CD36 (AF2519, RnD Systems, USA); and the housekeeping
protein VCP (ab11433, Abcam, UK) antibodies. Immunoprecipita-
tion was conducted using anti-FLAG (A2220, Sigma-Aldrich, DEU)
and anti-HA (A2095, Sigma-Aldrich, DEU) agarose from tissue
lysates using standard protocols.
Study design criteria and statistical analyses
Based upon preliminary data showing the expected effect size of
major outcome variables, a power analysis was conducted in order
to determine the minimal number of animals to be used for each
experiment. For genotype difference studies, offspring mice from
Het × Het breedings were initially randomised to each experiment
group. Afterwards, counterbalancing was done in order to realise
equal sample sizes per experimental group. When conducting stud-
ies, the investigators were aware of which mouse was in which
experimental group due to prior genotyping and allocation. However,
the technical assistants involved in the studies were blinded.
Statistical analyses were performed using t-tests (two-sided), or
2-way analysis of variance (ANOVA) with or without repeated
measures, where appropriate, with Holm–Sidak-adjusted post-tests.
Nonparametric tests (e.g. Mann–Whitney–Wilcoxon) were conducted
when data were not normally distributed. Correlation was determined
using Spearman’s correlation coefficient. All analyses were carried out
with SigmaPlot v.12 software (Systat Software GmbH, DEU).

The paper explained
Problem
A hallmark of obesity-driven T2D is insulin resistance, and thus “insulin
sensitisation” has been an attractive strategy for treatment. However,
insulin resistance likely represents a physiological feedback mechanism
to actually retard the development of obesity-driven complications.
Thus, alternative strategies are warranted, such as mild and intermittent
activation of stress-responsive pathways that are pro-adaptive.
Results
Here, we show that “growth arrest and DNA damage-inducible”
GADD45b as a dysregulated gene transcript during fasting in several
models
of
metabolic
dysfunction
including
ageing,
obesity/pre-
diabetes and type 2 diabetes, in both mice and humans. Using whole-
body knockout mice as well as liver/hepatocyte-specific gain- and
loss-of-function strategies, we revealed a role for liver GADD45b in the
coordination of liver fatty acid uptake, through cytoplasmic retention
of FABP1, ultimately impacting obesity-driven hyperglycaemia.
Impact
We identified liver GADD45b as a novel regulator of systemic and
hepatic lipid metabolism. Our findings demonstrate the importance of
fasting hepatic lipid metabolism in systemic metabolic control and
provide insight into the development of new therapies for metabolic
dysfunction.
