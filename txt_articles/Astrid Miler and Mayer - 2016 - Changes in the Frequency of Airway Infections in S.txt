Abstract
Background and aim: Cell and animal studies suggested that use of e-cigarettes may increase vulnerability to
respiratory infection, though the available studies have serious limitations. Limited data are available on respiratory
health of vapers.
Methods: An on-line survey assessed subjective changes in respiratory symptoms in smokers who switched to
vaping for at least two months.
Results: Among 941 responders, 29% reported no change in respiratory symptoms, 5% reported worsening, and
66% reported an improvement. Among qualitative comments, 232 elaborated on positive and 15 on negative
experiences.
Conclusion: The switch from smoking to vaping was associated with a reduced incidence of self-reported
respiratory infections. Further studies using objective measures in samples that are not self-selected are needed.

Introduction
E-cigarettes (EC) deliver nicotine without combustion chemicals
and are therefore considered to be much safer than conventional
cigarettes [1,2]. Some potential risks however have been flagged up in
cell and animal studies suggesting that vaping may increase
vulnerability to respiratory infections [3,4]. There are only limited data
available on respiratory health of vapers. Human EC trials reported no
significant adverse respiratory effects associated with EC use for up to
1.5 years and a follow-up study of smokers with asthma who switched
to vaping found significant improvements. We conducted an on-line
survey to assess subjective changes in respiratory symptoms in
smokers who switched to vaping for at least two months [5,6].
Methods
Design
The survey was posted by BM on two large German vape forums
previously used by BM, E-Rauchen-Forum (http://www.e-rauchen-
forum.de/thread-82289.html) 
and 
Dampfertreff-Forum 
(http://
www.dampfertreff.de/t118747f1379-Umfrage-Haeufigkeit-von-
Atemwegsinfektionen-quot-Schnupfen-quot-nach-Umstieg-auf-ECigs.html).
Most of the active members of these forums are ex-smokers using
refillable ‘tank’ system EC products.
The pre-amble to the survey explained that a recent article suggested
that vaping could increase rates of common cold and respiratory
infections; that BM’s experience was the opposite; and that the purpose
of the survey is to find out about any changes in rates of respiratory
infections vapers experience [3]. Responders were asked to respond
honestly and to note that the survey concerns respiratory infections
such as common cold and no other respiratory diseases such as asthma
or COPD. Responses were invited only from vapers who stopped
smoking completely or reduced smoking by at least 95% and who have
been vaping for at least 2 months. Appendix A includes verbatim
translation of the pre-amble and a screenshot of the survey page.
The question asked was: Since switching to e-cigarettes, the
frequency of any airways infections I get has: a) decreased; b) not
markedly changed; c) increased. We calculated proportions for each
answer and their confidence intervals for each answer using SPSS.
Participants were able to elaborate on their answers with further
comments.
The survey was conducted between 24th of September 2014 and
31st December 2015. The software identifies responders and prevents
repeated responses. Vapers who are members of both were asked to
answer only once.
Results
Altogether 941 responses were received. Figure 1 presents the
results. Overall, 29% of responders reported no change in respiratory
symptoms, 5% reported worsening, and 66% reported an improvement
(95% CI=62.9-69.0).

Figure 1: Self-reported changes in airway infections after switching
from smoking to vaping (N=941).
There were 247 qualitative responses commenting on improvements
or worsening in the rates of respiratory infections after switching from
smoking to vaping. The total of 232 comments concerned positive and
15 concerned negative effects.
Here are some typical reports of positive changes: “
As a smoker I
had an almost continuous cold. I’ve been a vaper for almost 2 years,
and for almost 2 years I’ve had no sniffing, no cough, nothing…”
“I’ve been vaping for 13 months and had none [infections] while
earlier I had colds and sore throat 2-3 times a year.”
“I’ve been vaping for 2 years and in this time I had one flu-like
infection. As a smoker I used to have them at least twice a year, for
weeks at a time. I used to have to deal with a persistent cough and
mucus production. This year the infection had passed within 3 days.”
Here are some examples of negative reports:
“I smoked for 15 years and in those 15 years I was never really ill.
After quitting smoking I have already had 2 flu-like infections […].”
“I have completely switched to vaping in 2009. At that time, the first
3 smoke-free years I was definitely sick less often than during my
smoking years. But I have observed that I have been sick more often in
the last 3-4 years (a cold about 4-5 times a year). However, I must say
that I became a father 4 years ago. Maybe it has to do with my
daughter - she often passes on her infections to me. I'm mostly ill after
she has been ill.”
Discussion
The majority of smokers who switched to vaping reported a
reduction in the frequency of respiratory infections.
The survey has several limitations. The reports were subjective and
there is a possibility that vapers were trying to portray vaping in a
positive light to counteract the general anti-vaping ethos of public
health and media coverage of vaping in German speaking countries.
The survey pleaded for honesty, but it is possible that some responders
reported improvements in infection resistance even when the actual
change was small or none. Even with this caveat concerning the size of
the positive change, the results are reassuring in that only a small
proportion of respondents reported an increase in infections. If
switching to vaping generated a genuine problem, it could be expected
that affected vapers would report this. Another potential problem is
that smokers who experience adverse effects when vaping could be
expected to stop using e-cigarettes and so would not be in the sample.
This however also means that should such effects exist, they would be
self-limiting. Other limitations concern a possibility that some
respondents may have been still smoking, or may have been vaping for
less than two months, although if this were the case, it would make the
results more rather than less conservative.
The results seem to contradict the findings from cell culture and
animal studies, but these studies have serious limitations. Regarding
the study that found a damage to epithelial cells harvested from 8-10
year old donors and incubated in e-liquid (not in e-cigarette aerosol)
for up to 48 h, it is unclear to what extent such exposure corresponds
to effects of vaping [3]. Also, no comparison with effects of cigarette
smoke was included. Regarding the mice study, it has been pointed out
that the increased morbidity and mortality in experimental animals
could have been caused by high levels of stress and nicotine poisoning
rather than by the presumed effects of free radicals [2,4]. The study did
not include a smoking control either, but it noted that the level of free
radicals was ‘several orders of magnitude lower than in cigarette
smoke’
. As noted earlier, human studies did not detect any adverse
effects of vaping and beneficial effects were noted on asthmatic patients
[6].
The finding of an improvement in respiratory health in people who
quit smoking is not surprising because smoking causes increased
susceptibility to respiratory infections [7]. In addition to this however,
there is also a possibility that inhaled propylene glycol may further
magnify this effect. This is because this key ingredient of most e-liquids
has antimicrobial effects [8]. In a classical experiment, 1mg of
propylene glycol vapour in two to four million cc. of air produced
complete sterilisation of air into which pneumococci, streptococci,
staphylococci, H. influenzae, and other microorganisms as well as
influenza virus had been sprayed [9]. Vaping may provide a degree of
antimicrobial protection, but experimental evidence is needed to
confirm whether such an effect exists.
In summary, the switch from smoking to vaping seems associated
with a reduced incidence of airway infections, but further studies using
objective measures are needed.
