Background-—Bone lead offers a better method over blood lead measurement to discern long-term lead exposure and
accumulation. We examined the risk of resistant hypertension based on bone lead levels in a prospective cohort study of NAS
(Normative Aging Study).
Methods and Results-—Participants had clinic data on hypertension (systolic blood pressure, diastolic blood pressure, and
antihypertension medication), lead (blood, bone-patella, bone-tibia), and demographic and confounding variables. Cases of
resistant hypertension were identified by meeting criteria for: (1) inadequate systolic blood pressure (>140 mm Hg) or diastolic
blood pressure (>90 mm Hg) while taking 3 medications or (2) requiring >4 medications for blood pressure control. A modified
Poisson regression was used for model analysis. Of the 475 participants, 97 cases of resistant hypertension (20.4%) were
identified. Among the cases of resistant hypertension, the median tibia and patella lead levels were 20 lg/g and 25 lg/g,
respectively, while median tibia and patella lead levels were 20 lg/g and 27.5 lg/g, respectively, in participants without resistant
hypertension. Tibia lead demonstrated a significant association with resistant hypertension (relative risk, 1.19; 95% confidence
interval, 1.01–1.41 [P=0.04]) per interquartile range increase in tibia lead (13–28.5 lg/g). Patella lead was not associated with
resistant hypertension (relative risk, 1.10; 95% confidence interval, 0.92–1.31 [P=0.31]) per interquartile range increase in patella
lead (18–40 lg/g). Blood lead levels were not significantly associated with resistant hypertension (relative risk, 1.11; 95%
confidence interval, 0.88–1.40 [P=0.38]).
Conclusions-—Tibia lead represents a novel risk factor for resistant hypertension. Our study demonstrates an increased
association between tibia lead and resistant hypertension status, with an increased risk of 19% per 1 interquartile range increase in
tibia lead. (J Am Heart Assoc. 2018;7:e010014. DOI: 10.1161/JAHA.118.010014.)

iagnosed hypertension continues to increase nationally,
with �1 in 3 American adults affected.1,2 The burden of
hypertension costs society significantly. In 2014, hyperten-
sion was the leading cause of >410 000 deaths, with an
estimated cost of $48.6 billion.2 Furthermore, the prevalence
of hypertension is expected to be >40% of the US population
by 2030.3 Given the magnitude of impact hypertension has on
society, scientists and clinicians are using a multipronged
approach to examine environmental, behavioral, and genetic
risk factors to screen at-risk populations. Managing risk occurs
in concert with optimizing medical management, with the most
recent recommendations published by the American College of
Cardiology/American Heart Association Task Force.4
Despite rigorous clinical guidelines and risk mitigation,
nearly half of people with hypertension lack appropriate
control of their disease.1 This can be attributed to insufficient
medical therapy, medication nonadherence and, lifestyle
behaviors. However, resistant hypertension, as defined by
persistent blood pressure (BP) above target while taking 3
antihypertension medications or controlled by >3 medica-
tions, remains a clinical burden.5,6 Epidemiologic studies
estimate that up to 20% of patients with hypertension will

review demonstrates a prevalence closer to 9% to 12%.6,7
Behavioral factors, polypharmacy, pathophysiologic volume
status, and secondary causes all contribute to the context
that makes an individual resistant to proper pharmacotherapy
for hypertension and subsequently at increased risk for
cardiovascular mortality.8,9
Lead has been studied for its potential role in elevated and
volatile BP. Prolonged exposure to lead has been found to
portend the development of hypertension.10 Cohort studies
have linked blood lead levels to increased BP and hyperten-
sive risk in England, Sweden, and the United States in both
men and women.11–14 Recently, blood lead has been shown to
be a possible attributable risk in >400 000 cardiovascular-
related deaths annually.15 While strong epidemiologic evi-
dence has been present for decades linking lead to elevation
in BP, recent basic science research has provided insight into
the mechanism of lead-induced hypertension. In vitro and
in vivo work points to lead interfering with systemic and local
BP control via activity of the renin-angiotensin system,
sympathetic system, and vasocontractility properties of
endothelium.16
The relationship between lead levels and BP, as well as
mechanisms by which lead exerts influence on BP regulation,
has been demonstrated in the literature. However, little work
exists investigating the clinical burden of lead as it relates to
hypertension. To our knowledge, no prior studies have
assessed the relationship between cumulative lead exposure
and risk of resistant hypertension. Given the interference
lead can have on vascular regulation, atherosclerotic progres-
sion, and BP we hypothesize that the lead level in bone as a
marker of cumulative lead exposure is an independent variable
influencing the development of resistant hypertension.
Methods
Data Availability
To protect patient privacy, individual data cannot be made
publicly available. Data are available upon request to qualified
researchers from the Veterans Administration.
Study Participants
All participants in the Veterans Affairs NAS (Normative Aging
Study) are men and predominantly white. NAS is a longitudinal
cohort study of 2280 male volunteers aged 21 to 80 years
based out of the Boston Veterans Affairs Healthcare system
initiated in 1963.17 In NAS, participants were seen in the clinic
every 3 to 5 years for a complete history and physical,
including measurement of BP and tracking of antihypertensive
medical management. BP was measured using a standard
mercury sphygmomanometer with an appropriately sized cuff.
Patients were seated and then had systolic BP (SBP) and fifth-
phase diastolic BP (DBP) measured bilaterally to the nearest
2 mm Hg. Final recorded SBP/DBP values were the result of
the average BPs from the right and left arm measurements.
Beginning in 1991, blood and bone lead measurements were
collected among participants who agreed to have those levels
recorded. Given the current study focus on the development of
resistant hypertension in patients with hypertension, partici-
pants were initially chosen if they were taking any medication
for
BP
control
or
had
elevated
BP
(SBP/DBP
≥140/
90 mm Hg). Further inclusion criteria were based on the
availability of data on hypertension (SBP, DBP, and antihyper-
tension medication), lead (bone-patella, bone-tibia, blood), and
demographic and confounding variables (listed below). Demo-
graphic and socioeconomic factors including age, race, educa-
tion
attainment,
and
income
level,
well-documented
confounders in the association between lead exposure and
BP, were all obtained through NAS questionnaires.10–12,15
Additionally, confounding variables including body mass index,
cigarette smoking (pack-years), and family history of hyperten-
sion were also obtained through NAS.
At
the
time
of
this
study,
871
participants
were
identified to have information for hypertension and lead.
Of these, 521 participants (59.8%) had a known diagnosis
of hypertension, were receiving an antihypertensive agent,
or had elevated SBP/DBP at the time of bone lead
assessment.

Clinical Perspective
What Is New?
• Cardiovascular sequelae may be contributed to by low levels
of lead that do not have overt clinical manifestations.
• Tibia lead levels, available via a noninvasive well-contained K
shell X-ray fluorescence measurement, may offer informa-
tion about risk of development of resistant hypertension.
• Low-level lead exposure, measured in the tibia, is associated
with risk of development of resistant hypertension in a
cohort of patients diagnosed with hypertension.
What Are the Clinical Implications?
• New knowledge on the health implications of low-level
exposure can help motivate exposure removal via infras-
tructure investment from a public health standpoint, as well
as further factor in the exposome in predictive modeling
from a clinical standpoint.
• Tibia lead is a novel biomarker for the risk of resistant
hypertension and may offer greater insight into how low-
level lead impedes pharmacologic management of hyper-
tension, as well as target more appropriate threshold for
intervention.

 excluded because of incomplete information on covariates,
yielding 475 as our final sample. Resistant hypertension
status was determined without knowledge of bone lead
levels. An individual was considered positive for resistant
hypertension if they met the above criteria starting from
one
clinic
visit
before
the
date
of
initial
bone
lead
measurement through the last year of data collected (from
the period of 1986–2013). Individuals who were consented
for NAS reported to the Ambulatory Clinical Research
Center of the Brigham and Women’s Hospital in Boston. All
participants provided written informed consent. This study
was reviewed and approved by the institutional review
boards of each participating institute, the University of
Michigan School of Public Health, the Harvard School of
Public Health, and the Department of Veterans Affairs
Boston Healthcare System.
Tibia and Patellar Bone Lead Levels
Lead levels were measured at the mid-tibia shaft and
patella with K x-ray fluorescence in NAS. Extensive review
has validated K shell X-ray fluorescence (KXRF) as a tool to
determine bone lead levels.18–20 KXRF is a noninvasive
method used to evaluate lead in bone via measurement of
x-ray traits correlating with fluorescent atoms of targeted
elements. Measurements occurred via 30-minute measure-
ments of the mid-tibia and patella. These data were
correlated with each participant and assessed as separate
variables (patella and tibia) to elucidate the correlative
power of cortical (tibia) versus trabecular (patella) bone.
The KXRF instrument also provided uncertainty measures,
indications of precision of the bone lead measurements.

of

measurements,
tibia

bone
measurements with uncertainty >10 lg and 15 lg per
gram of bone mineral, respectively, were excluded from our
analysis.
Blood Lead Levels
Blood samples were analyzed via graphite furnace atomic
absorption with Zeeman background correction (ESA Labora-
tories, Inc). Values <1 lg/dL were coded as 0 (<1%).
Following every 20 samples, the instrument was calibrated
with National Institute of Standards and Technology Standard
Reference Material (955a, lead in blood). Reference samples
from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (Atlanta,
GA), precision, measured as coefficient of variation ranged
from 8% (when blood lead levels were 10 to 30 lg/dL) to 1%
(when blood lead levels were >30 lg/dL).
Resistant Hypertension
During each Veterans Affairs visit, full clinical data were
collected, including information about individuals’ BP (mea-
surement methodology noted above) and medication list. For
the current study, resistant hypertension was defined as
inadequate BP control while taking ≥3 antihypertensive
medications of different classes (diuretic, b-blocker, calcium
channel blocker, a-inhibitor, angiotensin-converting enzyme
inhibitor, angiotensin receptor blocker, or mineralocorticoid
antagonist) or adequate control while taking ≥4 antihyper-
tensive medications. The cutoff for BP control was set at
140 mm Hg SBP and 90 mm Hg DBP.6,8 Given the time of
this study, SBP and DBP thresholds of 140 mm Hg and
90 mm Hg with medication quantity, as opposed to exact
regimen composition, were used as cutoff criteria for resistant
hypertension.
Statistical Analysis
Initial analysis examined descriptive statistics. We deter-
mined medians (interquartile ranges [IQRs]) for lead mea-
sures, as well as for other continuous variables, and
percentages for categorical variables based on the cohort
and on resistant hypertension status. Pearson correlation
was calculated for the relationship between tibia lead and
patella lead, as well as blood lead with tibia and patella lead,
respectively. A modified Poisson regression with a robust
error variance, the efficient approach recommended to
estimate relative risk (RR) in prospective studies with a
binary outcome, was used to assess the relationship between
resistant hypertension status and tibia and patella bone lead
levels, as well as blood lead leavels.21 Significance was
defined as a P value ≤0.05 for all analyses. We computed the
RRs for an IQR increase (ie, from the 25th to the 75th
percentile) for each lead marker as exp(IQR9b), and with 95%
confidence intervals (CIs) as exp(IQR9(b�1.969SE)), where
b and SE are the estimated regression coefficient and its
standard error. Analysis was adjusted for demographic and
confounding variables including age, race/ethnicity, educa-
tion attainment, income level, body mass index, family history
of hypertension, and cigarette smoking (pack-years). Race/
ethnicity was collapsed into white and nonwhite, given the
few black and Hispanic participants, and subsequently
referred to as race. Additionally, income was categorized
into 4 groups based on quartile of annual income earned: <
$6000, $6000 to $8599, $8600 to $9999, and >$10 000.
Given the nature of income data, the cutoffs were not exactly
in each quartile and therefore actual frequencies in each
group were not equal to 25%. Sensitivity analysis was
conducted for smoking status in combination with pack-
years. Smoking status was defined as never, current, or
former (having quit before baseline of the current study).

 Statistical analyses were performed using the geepack
package in R 3.4.3 GUI 1.70 El Capitan build (7463).
Results
Participants were predominantly white (96.8%) and ranged in
age from 48 to 93 years (mean age, 68.2 years) as seen in
Table 1. Median lead levels were 20 lg/g (IQR, 13–28.5 lg/
g) for the tibia and 27 lg/g (IQR, 18–40 lg/g) for the patella.
Distributions of tibia, patella, and blood lead levels are shown
in Figure 1. Tibia and patella lead were strongly correlated
(r=0.78; 95% CI, 0.75–0.82 [P<0.001]). Median blood lead
levels were 5.0 lg/dL (IQR, 3.36–8.00 lg/dL) and were
moderately associated with tibia lead levels (r=0.38; 95% CI,
0.30–0.46 [P<0.001]) and patella lead levels (r=0.43; 95% CI,
0.35–0.50 [P<0.001]). Age, smoking (pack-years), education,
and race were significantly associated with high tibia lead
levels (P<0.05), and age, smoking (pack-years), education,
and race were significantly associated with higher patella lead
levels (P<0.05).
Of the 475 total study participants with hypertension, 97
cases of resistant hypertension were identified with the
associated bone lead measurements, equaling 19.8% of all
study participants. Among the cases of resistant hyperten-
sion, median tibia lead was 20 lg/g and median patella lead
was 25 lg/g. Study participants without resistant hyperten-
sion had a median tibia lead level of 20 lg/g and median
patella lead level of 27.5 lg/g.

 between tibia and resistant hypertension (RR, 1.19; 95% CI,
1.01–1.41 [P=0.04]; model 3, Table 2), but not patella lead on
resistant hypertension status (RR, 1.10; 95% CI, 0.92–1.31
[P=0.31]; model 3, Table 2). As seen in Figure 2, there is a
linear dose-response relationship with tibia lead. There is a
steeper association observed in lower concentrations of tibia
lead, notably from 0 to 20 lg/g (Figure 2). Sensitivity
analysis for smoking status (current smoker, former smoker,
or never smoker) added to the fully adjusted model did not
significantly alter the relationship between tibia or patella lead
with resistant hypertension status (RR, 1.19; 95% CI, 1.01,
1.41 [P=0.04] and RR, 1.09; 95% CI, 0.92–1.30 [P=0.31]; data
not shown). Results for sequential models (model 1: age, body
mass index, smoking [pack-years]; model 2: model 1 plus
education, income, and race) are shown below in Table 2.
Whereas tibia bone lead demonstrated a significant
association with resistant hypertension, this was not found
when examining baseline blood lead levels as the exposure.
Final covariate adjustment for blood lead was not found to be
significantly associated with resistant hypertension (RR, 1.11;
95% CI, 0.88–1.40 [P=0.38]) (Table 2).
Discussion
For decades, lead has been studied for the nefarious effect it
can have on multiple organ systems. While the clinical
implication of lead exposure on neurological development has
been well studied, less is known about how lead impacts
clinical outcomes from a cardiovascular standpoint. The
statistically significant relationship between bone lead and BP
is well established; however, there is a paucity of research
supporting a clinically relevant relationship. Our study demon-
strates the association of cumulative lead burden, as measured
by cortical bone in the tibia, with development of resistant
hypertension. After accounting for body mass index, age, race,
income, education, cigarette smoking (pack-years), and family
history, we found a significant association between tibia bone
lead levels, although not patella or blood lead, and resistant
hypertension among men participating in NAS. To our knowl-
edge, this is the first study that posits cumulative lead exposure
as a risk factor for resistant hypertension development.
While blood lead measurements offer clinicians insight into
relatively recent exposure and toxicity, blood lead levels

 measured in circulation represents only 5% to 15% of total
body lead.18 Ingested lead distributes extensively throughout
the body and can be found deposited in various tissue types
and organs. Lead’s similarity to other cations, such as
calcium, allow it to compete in similar biochemical path-
ways.22 Bone lead levels account for �85% to 95% of total
body amounts.18 Additionally, the half-life of lead in cortical
bone is 25 to 30 years, and only 1 month in blood.19 Bone
serves as a cache for lead and accounts for 40% to 70% of
measured levels in blood predominantly as a result of turnover
in trabecular regions.23
Bone serves as a particularly expansive reservoir for lead
because of the high calcium requirement in the process of
hydroxyapatite formation during bone mineralization. Hydrox-
yapatite composes a majority of bone mass, and lead can
integrate into position normally filled by calcium. While
trabecular bone reveals higher enrichment of lead and more
rapid release into circulation, lead levels in cortical bone
better represent cumulative lead dose due to the prolonged
elimination half-life.24 Individuals faced with greater exposure
and hydroxyapatite capture of lead during the mineralization
process are vulnerable to greater absolute lead deposition in
cortical bone, as well as circulatory release from trabecular
bone.18,24
Lead has been shown to interfere with the function of
vasculature and endothelial cells through increases in renin-
angiotensin system and vasoconstricting prostanoids, in
combination with decreases in the potent vasodilator, nitric
oxide.25 In vivo research has focused on the mechanism by
which lead influences BP. Low levels of lead leads to a marked
decrease in nitric oxide bioavailability secondary to anion
superoxide production. Furthermore, lead upregulates renin-
angiotensin system activity via increased angiotensin-con-
verting enzyme and angiotensin II receptor type 1, as well as
greater production of cyclooxygenase-derived prostanoids,
which results in arterial contraction.25 Vasoconstriction
results in a further rise in BP.
In addition to effects on local vasodilatory properties and
renin-angiotensin system activity, lead levels can also cause
desensitization of ß-adrenergic receptors, which are widely
distributed throughout the body. ß2-receptors serve as arterial
targets, which result in vasodilation and a decrease in
systemic BP upon activation.26 In rat models of lead-exposure
and lead-removal studies, in vivo analysis revealed a signif-
icant reduction in ß-adrenergic receptor as the lead load
became larger.26,27 Understanding the relationship by which
cumulative lead deposition impedes control of hypertension
can aid in assessing patient risk.28 Furthermore, hypertensive
risk can be reduced by effective lifestyle.29 The addition of
mitigating environmental risk factors, such as lead, that
increase clinical risk of resistant hypertension may prove to
be another piece of the puzzle in lowering the burden of
hypertensive disease burden and complications.
Public health efforts to reduce lead exposure have
been successful in lowering lead levels among all age
demographics.30,31 However, clinical management remains

 largely targeted toward acute toxicity.31 The threshold for
acceptable blood lead levels is based off of historical
population distributions, yet no known normal level exists.32
With higher fidelity measurement devices, we can now
determine the subtle way in which long-term exposure to
lead relates to poor health outcomes. This knowledge has
prompted calls for lowering the threshold of acceptable lead
levels and the level of intervention.32–34 Vigilant screening
and exposure reduction remains the primary method to
reduce lead stores.35,36 Certain therapeutic interventions,
such as calcium supplementation, may offer additional
actionable items in reducing lead levels and pathologic
sequelae.37 The current study and other work demonstrating
the relationship between lead and hypertension suggests
that investigation into more aggressive screening, exposure
reduction, and intervention at the individual level may
prove beneficial in certain patients with high cardiovascular
risk.10–13,18,37,38
Study Limitations
There are key limitations to note in the current study. Patients
categorized as meeting criteria for resistant hypertension may
experience uncontrolled hypertension attributable to sec-
ondary causes uncaptured by the current study. Because of
the method by which resistant hypertension was defined and
the variability of office BP measurements, we can only
ascertain that cases are “apparent resistant hypertension.”
This leaves the possibility of certain identified resistant
hypertension cases actually being captured secondary causes
of treatment resistance or isolated elevations in BP that could
otherwise be captured by ambulatory BP monitoring.39
However, our study sample is similar to the estimate of 10%
to 20% of those diagnosed with hypertension meeting criteria
of resistant hypertension and does not appear to exceed
population expectations. Future studies utilizing ambulatory
BP monitoring and incorporating diagnosis that can cause
apparent resistant hypertension would allow for more accu-
rate classification of true resistant hypertension.
Among our 3 exposure variables (tibia, patella, and blood
leads), only tibia demonstrated a significant association. Lead
levels in both the tibia and patella have previously been
demonstrated to be positively associated with hypertension
risk and cardiovascular outcomes.10,20 KXRF precision has
been validated for bone lead levels >10 lg in clinical settings,
and even <10 lg in research settings.18 However, there is
greater measurement precision for tibia bone lead due to
bone mineral density, in comparison to patella bone lead.18
The relative difference in precision of tibia versus patella lead
levels via KXRF may also influence the reliability of tibia as a
viable biomarker. Our model did not demonstrate a statisti-
cally significant association between patella lead and resistant
hypertension, only tibia lead and resistant hypertension.
However, both sources of lead had a positive association with
risk of resistant hypertension, which is consistent with prior
literature.10,20
All participants in NAS are men, and primarily white, which
reduces the generalizability of this study. A more represen-
tative cohort is necessary to assess the relationship between
bone lead and resistant hypertension across various demo-
graphics. Additionally, we included a relatively small sample
size, 475 participants, which may decrease our power to
detect effect size and increases the risk of type I error. The
final cohort may be subject to selection bias, as there is
higher mortality associated with resistant hypertension. The
inherent mortality faced by participants with the outcome of
interest may cause loss of follow-up before full data
collection. This limitation reduces the certainty with which
we can draw conclusions from the current study.
Conclusions
Lead has no known physiologic role in the body and historical
lead levels for clinical intervention have been based on
population standard distributions and presentation of acute
toxicity. However, the cumulative effect of low-level lead may
manifest through more subtle mechanisms of slow interfer-
ence with biochemical systems involved in vascular contrac-
tility and volume management. This is the first study, to our
knowledge, that points to cumulative low-level lead exposure
as a potential risk factor for resistant hypertension. Further
reduction in lead exposure and burden may improve BP
management
and
reduce
the
prevalence
of
resistant
hypertension.
