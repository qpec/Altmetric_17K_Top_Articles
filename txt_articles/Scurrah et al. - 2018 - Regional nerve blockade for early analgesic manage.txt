Summary
Elderly patients with hip fracture experience high morbidity and mortality, and are often undertreated for pain.
Acute pain management in the elderly is challenging, with physiological frailty, medical comorbidities and cognitive
impairment commonly compounding pain assessment and treatment. Guidelines outlining current best practice for
acute pain management in the elderly now exist, but evidence suggests that practice remains variable and there
continues to be scope for improvement. We conducted a narrative review of the literature to examine the challenges
of acute pain management in the elderly, and to evaluate evidence for the role of regional nerve blocks for acute pain
associated with hip fracture in the elderly. There is consistent evidence that regional nerve blocks can effectively
reduce pain associated with hip fracture, providing rapid-onset, site-specific analgesia that is more effective than
standard systemic analgesia alone. There is also moderate evidence that nerve blocks may contribute to reduced rates
of delirium, and some suggestion of reduced length of inpatient stay, morbidity and mortality, although limited
evidence is available. Fascia iliaca blocks are emerging as a block of choice, with evidence they can be safely and
rapidly administered under ultrasound guidance in the acute setting, by both trained medical and nursing staff, with
good effect. Ideally, comprehensive pain protocols for elderly hip fracture patients are required, that integrate
evidence-based fascia iliaca block use, timely and repeated pain assessment, and multidisciplinary orthogeriatric
patient care.

Introduction
Hip fracture (fractured neck of femur) is an increas-
ingly common emergency surgical presentation [1, 2]
and a rising social and economic burden [3]. Economi-
cally, the annual cost of proximal femoral fracture in
the UK alone is projected to be between £3.6 and
5.6 billion per annum (inflation adjusted) by the year
2033 [2]. This reflects the high morbidity and mortal-
ity of the condition, particularly among the frail elderly
[2, 4, 5]. According to published guidelines from the
Association of Anaesthetists of Great Britain and Ire-
land (AAGBI), 8–10% of patients die within 30 days

 of hip fracture, and typically 15–30% of patients die
within a year of surgery [6]. This can vary across
patient cohorts, with one prospective hospital audit
reporting that 43.1% of patients died in the first year
and 75% died within five years of hip fracture [5]. A
number of variables have been shown to be predictive
of hip fracture mortality, including: advanced age;
cognitive dysfunction; the inability to independently
mobilise; and premorbid functional dependence [5]. Of
these,
advanced
age
and
poor
cognitive
function
appeared to be associated with the greatest relative risk
of five-year mortality [5]. Since the hip fracture popu-
lation has a median age over 80 years, and approxi-
mately one-third of patients demonstrate significant
cognitive impairment at presentation [3], high mortal-
ity among elderly hip fracture patients is likely to be
an ongoing issue.
In a previous retrospective database review, patients
aged > 85 years with hip fracture demonstrated a greater
incidence of complications and an increased length of
stay, compared with those < 85 years [7]. Odds ratios
were significantly increased for lower respiratory tract
infection, myocardial infarction and acute renal failure
for those aged > 85 years (OR 1.58, 1.67 and 1.54,
respectively). Length of stay was also significantly longer,
at a median of 18 days (compared with 15 days for those
< 85 years) [7]. Only one in three older people who sur-
vive a hip fracture return to their previous level of inde-
pendence, 50% require long-term assistance with routine
activities and cannot walk unaided, and 25% require full-
time nursing home care [8].
The functional decrement, as well as the high rates of
morbidity and mortality, highlights the need to reduce
modifiable risks to mortality wherever possible. It has
been suggested that up to 50% of postoperative deaths
following hip fracture are potentially avoidable [9],
demonstrating considerable room for improvement in
the management of the elderly hip fracture population.
Globally, many organisations and policy makers
have recognised the need for improvement in quality
of care for the elderly hip fracture patient, producing
guidelines in Australia [10], the UK [6, 11] and the US
[12]. In particular, there is growing recognition of the
importance of optimal pain management in the impor-
tant peri-operative period. Pain management can be
particularly challenging in the physiologically frail and
elderly, and the acute trauma setting [13]. This narra-
tive review describes the unique challenges of acute
pain management in the elderly, and reviews evidence
for the use of regional nerve blockade to provide anal-
gesia after hip fracture in the elderly.
Methods
For this narrative review, we conducted a literature
search of the PubMed, Ovid Medline and Cochrane
databases in May 2017 to identify relevant published
clinical trials, clinical audits, review articles and meta-
analyses up to that date. Key search terms included:
‘fractured neck of femur’; ‘hip fracture’; ‘elderly’; ‘acute
pain’; ‘nerve block’; ‘fascia iliaca block’; ‘delirium’;
‘pain protocol’; and ‘pain pathway’. Articles were con-
sidered if they were published in English, and were
excluded if they recruited children (< 18 years). We
read the abstracts of retrieved citations to identify
relevant articles to review in their entirety. Reviewed
literature was critically evaluated using the Evidence
Hierarchy
of
the
National
Health
and
Medical
Research Council of Australia [14]. Two authors inde-
pendently graded the level of evidence presented in
each paper, and a third author reviewed for consensus.
There
was
100%
inter-rater
concordance
for
all
reviewed
studies,
with
no
discrepancies
between
authors identified.
Pain in acute hip fracture
Severe pain increases morbidity associated with hip
fracture. Patients who experience greater pain have a
higher risk of delirium, are slower to mobilise, have a
longer hospital stay and poorer health-related quality
of life [15–17]. Hung et al. advocate the importance of
optimal pain control following hip fracture in order to
minimise complications of pain and immobility rang-
ing from delirium to functional loss and death [4].
Providing patients with effective analgesia has been
shown to reduce delirium, with delirium being an
independent risk factor for death, institutionalisation
and dementia [18–21].
Analgesia-prescribing practices in hip fracture
Numerous studies indicate that elderly hip fracture
patients are typically under-treated for pain [22–24].

 fracture across 36 Australian hospitals, Holdgate et al.
found that undertreatment of pain was common and
time to analgesia in this cohort was relatively slow
[22]. Twenty-nine per cent of patients had no record
of analgesia in the emergency department (ED), and
half of these also received no pre-hospital analgesia. Of
those who did receive some form of pain relief, intra-
venous (i.v.) morphine was the most common analge-
sia administered, although the median time to first
analgesia was 75 min after arrival in the ED. The
authors also commented on very limited utilisation of
regional analgesia, with only 45 patients (7%) receiving
a nerve block [22]. Cognitive impairment and commu-
nication difficulties were reported as the most common
barriers to the provision of analgesia among the elderly
[22].
Similar findings were observed in a US study,
where it was found that 50% of older patients with
moderate to severe pain following hip fracture received
inadequate
analgesia
[23].
Those
with
advanced
dementia were seen to receive one-third the amount of
morphine sulphate equivalents as cognitively intact
patients. Among the cognitively intact, 40% reported
severe pain, suggesting that the majority of dementia
patients, who received far less analgesia in comparison,
were also in severe pain postoperatively even if unable
to communicate this effectively [23]. Better methods of
assessing and treating acute pain in the cognitively
impaired patient are needed. Although some attempts
are being made to develop specific, evidence-based
guidelines for acute pain management in the cogni-
tively impaired, implementation appears to be poor
and current practices remain variable at best [24].
Pain assessment practices
Accurate and timely pain assessment is a critical com-
ponent of optimal pain management. Evidence-based
practice guidelines for the assessment of acute pain
have been released by multiple bodies, including the
Joint Commission on the Accreditation of Healthcare
(JCAHO) [25, 26], the Agency for Health Care Policy
and Research (AHCPR) [27] and the American Pain
Society (APS) [28]. Although pain assessment practices
have been recognised internationally as one of the key
quality indicators for geriatric emergency care [29, 30],
there is evidence that the implementation of pain
assessment and re-assessment continues to be variable
and inadequate among elderly trauma populations [31,
32]. This
becomes particularly
challenging among
those with cognitive impairment, dementia or delir-
ium, when commonly used self-report assessment tools
are often uninformative [23, 33, 34]. For the assess-
ment of pain in cognitively impaired or non-verbal
patients, it is recommended that methods of beha-
vioural observation be utilised [35, 36]. There is cur-
rently no international consensus on a standardised
tool, although a number of validated alternatives are
available including the Australian Abbey Pain Scale
[37] endorsed by the Australian Department of Health
[38], and the American DS-DAT assessment [39].
Opiate use for hip fracture in the elderly
A retrospective, observational study conducted by
White et al. identified that 36% of hip fracture patients
have renal dysfunction on admission to hospital, with
nearly 29% demonstrating grade-3 chronic kidney dis-
ease [40]. This cohort of patients is at high risk of
morphine accumulation and subsequent over-sedation
and respiratory depression, which can lead to respira-
tory tract infections and hypoxia. These are some of
the reasons why the AAGBI guidelines suggest caution
with opiate use in elderly hip fracture patients [6].
There is also some suggestion that opiate use may be
associated
with
delirium
in
elderly
patients
[41],
although this association is not always consistent [24].
Hamrick and Meyer suggest that, other than meperi-
dine, opiates are among the safe alternatives to give
elderly patients without the risk of delirium [20]. It
should be noted that untreated pain can itself trigger
delirium [42–44], thus a delicate balance must be
achieved between effectively treating pain, and min-
imising the amount of opiates required to do so.
The role of regional nerve blockade for hip
fracture
Systemic analgesia poses significant challenges among
physiologically frail, elderly trauma patients. Thus,
there is growing interest in the role of regional anaes-
thesia and analgesia, particularly for this vulnerable
patient population (for review, see [45]). There is
mounting evidence to support the use of regional
nerve blocks for acute pain in the elderly, associated

Scurrah et al. | Review of regional nerve block for elderly hip fracture
 with a fractured hip. A recent Cochrane review sup-
ports the use of regional nerve blocks to reduce acute
pain after hip fracture, with high-quality evidence
showing that regional blockade reduces pain on move-
ment within 30 min of block placement [46].
Femoral nerve blocks have been shown to effec-
tively reduce pain associated with hip fracture, in a
manner that is site-specific, rapid in onset and reduces
the need for opiates and breakthrough analgesia.
Benefits beyond effective analgesia have also been
suggested, including reduced incidence of delirium,
reduced hospital stay, decreased mortality, as well as
ease of nerve block administration in ED or even the
pre-hospital setting.
Reduced pain and opiate requirements
There is consistent evidence that nerve blocks can
reduce pain associated with hip fracture. Numerous
studies
have
demonstrated
that
nerve
blocks
can
reduce pain scores significantly more than systemic
analgesia [15, 47–49]. Abou-Setta’s systematic review
found statistically significant evidence that epidural
(p < 0.001),
fascia
iliaca
block
(FIB)
(p = 0.05),
femoral nerve block (FNB) (p < 0.001), psoas com-
partment
block
(p = 0.002)
and
combined
nerve
blocks (p < 0.001), all provided superior analgesia to
no block or standard care [15]. Among those studies
reviewed, those that utilised ultrasound guidance and
sampled a large patient population demonstrated the
most significant positive effects of regional blockade.
There is also consistent evidence that the use of regio-
nal nerve blocks can reduce the consumption of opi-
ates following hip fracture [50–57], and reduce the
incidence of opiate side-effects and overdose [53, 55–
57].
Improved positioning
The use of nerve blocks has been shown to increase
hip flexion following hip fracture, and enable patients
to sit more comfortably [58]. Blocks have also been
shown to reduce pain during positioning for spinal
anaesthesia [48, 59, 60].
Delirium prevention
There is mounting evidence that the use of femoral
nerve blocks can reduce the incidence of delirium in
elderly subjects with hip fracture [57, 61–63]. Abou-
Setta’s meta-analyses support this, identifying moderate
strength evidence in favour of statistically reduced inci-
dence of delirium with nerve blockades compared with
no blockade [15]. This is likely multifactorial, and may
reflect a number of factors including improved pain
control, analgesic efficacy and reduced opioid con-
sumption among those who receive nerve blockade.
However, these findings have not been supported by a
recent Cochrane review that was unable to identify
sufficient high-quality evidence to conclusively demon-
strate reduced incidence of delirium following the use
of nerve blockade [46]. Given the promising primary
evidence, further research in this area is a priority.
Reduced hospital length of stay
There is some evidence to suggest that nerve blocks
may shorten hospital stay in fractured hip patients [50,
57]. One study found length of stay was reduced to a
mean of 10 days among patients who received FIB,
compared with 15 days for those who did not receive
a block [50]. There is also some suggestion that the
use of nerve blocks may accelerate patient rehabilita-
tion and recovery following hip fracture. Morrison
et al. reported that patients who received femoral
nerve blocks walked further three days after surgery
and had better mobility at six weeks, than those who
received conventional analgesia only [55]. Moreover,
Mangram et al. identified that a greater proportion of
patients who received FIBs in addition to standard
analgesic care were discharged home to their own resi-
dence, compared with those who received standard
analgesic care alone (18.2% vs. 3.1%, respectively) [64].
Reduced mortality and morbidity
There has been some suggestion that the use of nerve
blocks may reduce inpatient mortality following hip
fracture, however, evidence remains inconclusive. Lees
et al. identified that inpatient mortality was signifi-
cantly lower among patients who received FIB, than
those who did not (5.5% vs. 15% (p = 0.0024), respec-
tively) [50]. Similarly, Pederson et al. found that a
comprehensive hip fracture programme that incorpo-
rated the use of continuous femoral nerve block cathe-
ters reduced 12-month mortality from 29% to 23%,
although multiple factors likely contributed to this

 [65]. Overall, Abou-Setta’s systemic review and meta-
analysis could not identify a statistically significant
reduction in mortality with nerve blocks based on lim-
ited available evidence, suggesting further investigation
is needed.
In a similar vein, on the basis of limited available
evidence, there was no statistically significant differ-
ence found with nerve blockade for cardiac complica-
tions, deep vein thrombosis, pulmonary embolism,
myocardial infarction, nausea and vomiting, respira-
tory infection, stroke, surgical wound infection, urine
retention or urinary tract infections in the systematic
review conducted by Abou-Setta et al. [15], although it
was suggested that more studies in these areas are
required. In Guay et al.’s recent Cochrane review,
there is now moderate-quality evidence for a reduced
risk of pneumonia following the use of nerve blocks
[46]. In a study by Monzon et al., patients who
received FIB reported fewer adverse events including
delirium, nausea and vomiting, as compared with
those who received i.v. non-steroidal anti-inflammatory
drugs [62]. Foss et al. also reported that patients who
received FIB were less sedated at 180 min after admin-
istration than those who received an intramuscular
(i.m.) injection of morphine 0.1 mg.kg�1 [53].
Patient satisfaction
Although rarely reported, patient satisfaction is another
important consideration when evaluating pain manage-
ment. A small study conducted by Diakomi et al. pro-
vides preliminary evidence that hip fracture patients
who received FIB were more satisfied than those treated
with i.v. fentanyl before positioning for spinal analgesia.
All patients who received a nerve block indicated that
they would prefer to receive the same management in
the event of a future operation, compared with only 25%
of those who received i.v. fentanyl [60]. Table 1 provides
an itemised summary of the prospective, randomised
controlled studies published to date. For a full list of
reviewed evidence, including cohort studies, retrospec-
tive studies and clinical audits, please see additional
Table S1 included as Supporting Information.
Fascia iliaca block
The FIB is a relatively new form of femoral nerve
block, whereby local anaesthetic is deposited deep to
the fascia iliacus, lateral to the femoral artery and infe-
rior to the inguinal ligament. With growing evidence
that this is a safe, quick and easy to insert block [47,
66–69], FIBs are gaining popularity and becoming
widely used for peri-operative pain relief in acute hip
fracture, as seen by the increasing use of FIBs in the
literature over the last decade [11, 70]. The FIB has
been found to be comparable in effectiveness to older
blocks such as the ‘3-in-1’ femoral nerve block [71],
with now sufficient evidence to support that FIB can
provide superior or equal pain relief to other forms of
acute analgesia [72].
Rashiq et al. [18] suggest that different nerve
blocks are more effective for particular outcomes.
Specifically, the combination of obturator and lateral
femoral cutaneous nerve (LFCN) blockade was the
most
effective
against
acute
postoperative
pain,
whereas the FIB had the highest probability of being
the most effective against delirium [18]. Results show
a 70% reduction in delirium associated with fascia ili-
aca blockade. However, this study encompassed many
trials that did not include patients with pre-operative
cognitive impairment, arguably the group most likely
to get delirium and the hardest in whom to detect
delirium and pain. This review did not include studies
that used ultrasound to locate the nerve or improve
safety, and if performed optimally, it should block the
obturator, LFCN and the femoral nerve. Newman et al.
conducted a randomised controlled trial comparing
analgesic efficacy of the FIB and the FNB for hip frac-
ture patients [73]. Although they reported greater effi-
cacy for FNBs, there has been criticism of the trial
methodology and the techniques of block delivery (see
related comments [74–79]. In addition, this trial did
not use ultrasound guidance, therefore, all three nerves
may not have been blocked correctly, and the trial did
not include patients with cognitive impairment, which
may have resulted in an underestimation of the effect
of the block on delirium.
Ultrasound guidance improves FIB safety and efficacy
It is clear that the use of appropriate methodology
for FIB insertion is critical for maximising block
safety and efficacy. There is substantial evidence and
growing consensus around best-practice FIB protocols.
It is now well accepted that ultrasound guidance

Scurrah et al. | Review of regional nerve block for elderly hip fracture
 improves both the safety and efficacy of FIB, with
Cochrane and evidence-based guidelines identifying
ultrasound guidance as the gold-standard localisation
technique for regional nerve blocks [80–82]. Dolan
et al. [83] performed a direct comparison of FIB
when performed with ultrasound guidance, vs. a more
rudimentary
‘loss-of-resistance’
or
‘two-pop’
tech-
nique. Ultrasound guidance resulted in significantly
greater incidence of sensory loss in the medical aspect
of the thigh (95% vs. 60%), and increased incidence
of complete sensory loss in the anterior, medial and
lateral thigh (82% vs. 47%). Ultrasound guidance also
significantly increased the incidence of femoral and
obturator nerve motor block [83]. In a similar trial,
Abrahams et al. showed that ultrasound guidance was
superior to peripheral nerve stimulation for FIB local-
isation, resulting in faster, safer and more successful
FIB insertion [84].
Barrington and Kluger provided evidence that ultra-
sound guidance for peripheral nerve blocks reduces the
incidence of local anaesthetic systemic toxicity (LAST)
with an odds ratio of 0.2 [85]. This corroborates earlier
work [86], including a study which showed that ultra-
sound guidance reduced unintentional vascular punc-
ture, reduced block failure rates,
decreased
block
performance time, reduced onset time to analgesia and
facilitated longer duration of block [80, 84].
Optimising fascia iliaca block safety using ropivacaine
Evidence demonstrates that the FIB is a safe block to
perform, with minimal documented accounts of side-
effects or complications. In an audit of two large Euro-
pean hospitals with 1586 fractured hip patients who
received FIB, there were only two cases of true anaes-
thetic toxicity reported [50]. Ropivacaine is emerging
as an anaesthetic agent of choice for optimal FIB
safety. It has been shown to produce less potent motor
blockade but equally effective sensory block as dose-
equivalent bupivacaine [87]. Studies of i.v. ropivacaine
infusion in healthy volunteers have also demonstrated
superior tolerance and less cardiac and central nervous
system toxicity associated with ropivacaine compared
with bupivacaine [88, 89].
Bleckner et al. tested serum ropivacaine concentra-
tions and LAST in trauma patients with continuous
peripheral nerve block catheters [90, 91]. They found
that no patients demonstrated clinical signs of systemic
ropivacaine toxicity, even two patients who demon-
strated isolated serum ropivacaine concentration spikes
into a previously identified toxic range. In addition, they
found that the total duration of local anaesthetic infu-
sion did not seem to influence the free concentration of
the drug, despite infusion times of up to 27 days. For
elderly fractured hip patients, the ED50 and ED95 of
30 ml of levobupivacaine were very low (0.026% and
0.036% w/v, respectively) [92], thus, if the correct doses
are used, the chance of reaching toxic levels in these
patients is extremely rare. Correct dosage combined
with ultrasound guidance will further decrease the risk
of harm as suggested in most guidelines [11, 70, 93].
Fascia iliaca block for early pre-operative analgesia
Making it particularly attractive for use in the emer-
gency and acute trauma setting, research has demon-
strated
that
practitioners
other
than
specialist
anaesthetists can safely administer FIB in EDs and
pre-hospital settings. In a recent trial, McRae et al.
found that paramedics could safely administer FIB to
hip fracture patients at the scene of their injury, with
better pain reduction after 15 min compared with
patients who received standard analgesic care (50% vs.
22%, p = 0.025). Importantly, this did not increase
scene times or cause any adverse effects [66]. Dochez
et al. showed that emergency medical service nurses
could safely administer FIBs to hip fracture patients
during pre-hospital care with a success rate of 96%,
resulting in marked reduction in pain scores and no
complications noted [68]. The work of Obideyi et al.
has also demonstrated that with appropriate training,
nurses can safely and effectively administer FIBs [94].
Numerous audits and trials have demonstrated
safety and improved patient outcomes when FIBs are
administered to hip fracture patients in the ED [52,
69, 95]. This includes blocks that are administered by
well-trained junior medical staff in addition to more
senior specialists [47, 96].
Nerve blocks as part of a comprehensive
analgesia protocol
It is evident there are multiple treatment components
that can improve outcomes for the frail hip fracture
patient.

 timely treatments are advised, with multiple guidelines
recommending specialist pain treatment protocols com-
bined with early specialist geriatric input and surgery
within 48 h [97–101]. Immediate admission of elderly
hip fracture patients to an orthogeriatric service has
been shown to improve patient outcomes, including
mobility at 4 months [102]. Dedicated clinical pathway
use has also been shown to lower the odds of four
common complications of hospitalisation after hip frac-
ture: deep vein thrombosis, pressure ulcers, surgical site
infection and urinary tract infection [103]. Multidisci-
plinary models of orthogeriatric care can improve out-
comes and decrease inpatient complications following
hip fracture, particularly for the elderly [104–107]. Inte-
grating the orthogeriatrician into the care plan for hip
fracture patients provides an opportunity to identify
and reduce risk factors pertinent to these frail patients
at risk of delirium and other common geriatric compli-
cations, while monitoring for poly-pharmacy and drug
interactions that may occur during pain management
in the acute peri-operative period. United Kingdom
and Australian guidelines suggest that the use of regio-
nal nerve blocks can be well integrated into compre-
hensive pain pathways [6, 10]. Ultimately, the use of
streamlined, comprehensive pain protocols that inte-
grate timely pain assessment, the use of regional nerve
blocks and specialist geriatric input promise to provide
the greatest combined benefits to acute pain manage-
ment, the quality of patient care and subsequent mor-
bidity and mortality (Table 2).
Discussion
This narrative review identified Level-1 and Level-2
evidence for using regional nerve blocks to provide
analgesia after hip fracture, including two meta-ana-
lyses and a number of prospective randomised con-
trolled
trials
(Table 1).
The
majority
of
available
literature provided Level-3 evidence [14], including
Table 2 Methodological evidence for optimal efficacy and safety of the fascia iliace block (FIB) technique.

Compared to localisation via anatomical landmarks,
nerve stimulation and/or ‘loss of resistance’, ultrasound
guidance:
improves the efficacy of sensory blockade; reduces the
incidence of complications and/or local anaesthetic
systemic toxicity; can reduce block onset time; and
reduce the required dose of anaesthetic.

Scurrah et al. | Review of regional nerve block for elderly hip fracture
 cohort
studies,
pseudorandomised
or
uncontrolled
trials, and retrospective analyses. In these studies,
quantitative outcome measures of analgesic efficacy
(such as pain scores and recorded opiate use), the
complications of untreated acute pain (including the
incidence of delirium, mortality and other morbidity),
and indicators of system efficiency (such as hospital
length of stay and adherence to analgesic guidelines)
were often only partially explored. Cowan et al.’s
recent literature review supports the suggestion that
regional blockade be considered for all those with
fractured
hips,
but
acknowledges
that
pain
relief
must be individualised and further research is war-
ranted [13].
Of note, it would be beneficial to further explore
the cost analysis of a reduction in delirium in the
elderly which is known to extend length of stay. It
would also be of interest to extend studies examining
mortality and to explore prospectively the incidence of
surgical complications and falls which may be of great
benefit to surgeons, departments of pain medicine and
hospital administrators. However, there is sufficient
evidence to support that regional nerve blocks provide
effective analgesia and reduce the need for opiates
among the elderly with hip fracture.
A recent Cochrane review explored the use of
nerve blocks for the management of hip fracture pain
in the pre-operative, intra-operative and postoperative
periods [46]. It included all types of blocks including
triple blocks, obturator blocks and others inserted
using a variety of techniques including ultrasound,
nerve stimulation and anatomical landmarks alone.
This review identified improvements in pain on move-
ment, the risk of pneumonia and the costs of analgesia
following the use of nerve blocks. Due to a rigorous
review protocol and strict inclusion criteria however,
only 31 out of 1116 identified articles were included.
As a result, meta-analyses on acute confusional states
and mortality lacked sufficient power and thus defini-
tive conclusions about the impact of nerve blocks on
these outcomes could not be drawn.
Regarding the translation of evidence into prac-
tice, a number of important considerations have been
raised in the literature related to the use of regional
nerve blockade for acute pain of hip fracture in the
elderly. These include local resource considerations,
such as the availability of equipment in the ED
including ultrasound, the provision of easy to use
regional blockade kits, the level of training and confi-
dence among emergency medical and nursing staff in
the administration of nerve blocks, and often a lack
of training in pain assessment protocols
for the
elderly, delirious and demented. There are also sys-
tem-wide considerations, which can include a lack of
hospital guidelines for analgesia in the elderly that
incorporate regional blockade, the pressures on ED
staff to process and discharge patients to the ward as
soon as possible, and often a widespread exclusive
reliance on parenteral and oral opioids to treat acute
pain in the elderly.
To facilitate the translation of evidence into prac-
tice, these issues need to be addressed with support
from administrators, policy makers, clinicians and fun-
ders. Education and training is vital to ensure that
knowledge, confidence and competency in best-prac-
tice nerve block techniques remain high among emer-
gency staff [51, 108–110]. Identifying local champions,
trainers and auditors could be a useful way to initiate
change and shift thinking from a universal reliance on
opiates for the management of acute pain in the
elderly [54, 108]. The development of specific clinical
pathways and protocols for the treatment of pain in
the elderly have also been shown to be effective [50,
57, 107], acknowledging the different physiology and
analgesic requirements of this vulnerable group.
Conclusions
Nerve blocks such as FIB for the elderly hip fracture
patient should be integrated into routine multi-modal
acute pain management protocols. They have been
shown to effectively reduce acute pain, the need for
opiates, decrease the incidence of delirium, and poten-
tially have further consequent benefits for morbidity,
mortality and quality of life. Continued research is
needed to quantify the extent of these benefits and elu-
cidate whether other peri-operative complications may
also be reduced by the use of nerve blocks. Targeted
education and training programmes will be important
to increase clinician awareness, confidence and compe-
tency in block techniques and ensure evidence-based
acute pain guidelines are effectively translated into
clinical practice.
