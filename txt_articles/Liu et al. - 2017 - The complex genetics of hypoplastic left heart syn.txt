Abstract
Congenital heart disease (CHD) affects up to 1 % of live births1. Although a genetic etiology is 
indicated by an increased recurrence risk2,3, sporadic occurrence suggests that CHD genetics is 
complex4. Here, we show that hypoplastic left heart syndrome (HLHS), a severe CHD, is 
multigenic and genetically heterogeneous. Using mouse forward genetics, we report what is, to our 
knowledge, the first isolation of HLHS mutant mice and identification of genes causing HLHS. 
Mutations from seven HLHS mouse lines showed multigenic enrichment in ten human 
chromosome regions linked to HLHS5–7. Mutations in Sap130 and Pcdha9, genes not previously 
associated with CHD, were validated by CRISPR–Cas9 genome editing in mice as being digenic 
causes of HLHS. We also identified one subject with HLHS with SAP130 and PCDHA13 
mutations. Mouse and zebrafish modeling showed that Sap130 mediates left ventricular 
hypoplasia, whereas Pcdha9 increases penetrance of aortic valve abnormalities, both signature 
HLHS defects. These findings show that HLHS can arise genetically in a combinatorial fashion, 
thus providing a new paradigm for the complex genetics of CHD.
Mouse chemical mutagenesis coupled with ultrasound phenotyping of 100,000 fetal mice 
has yielded a wide spectrum of CHD mutants8,9, including the recovery of eight HLHS 
mutant lines (Supplementary Table 1 and Supplementary Figs. 1 and 2). Ultrasound 
detection of HLHS lines, relative to control (Fig. 1a), showed a narrowed aortic flow (Fig. 
1b and Supplementary Video 1) and a small left ventricle (LV) with poor contractility (Fig. 
1b and Supplementary Video 2). Hypoplasia of the LV, aorta, and mitral valve (MV)—
essential features of HLHS—were confirmed by necropsy and histopathology (Fig. 1c,d and 
Supplementary Videos 3 and 4). As observed clinically, the small LV often appeared muscle 
bound with lumen obliteration (Fig. 1d). Unlike other CHD phenotypes, HLHS exhibited 
nonmendelian segregation, and only one HLHS mutant was recovered per line, except for 
the Ohia line, which had two mutants (Supplementary Table 1).
Exome sequencing of the eight HLHS lines recovered 330 coding or splicing mutations, 
none of which were shared, thus indicating that HLHS is genetically heterogeneous 
(Supplementary Data 1). Mutations in five Notch-related genes (Rbpj, Ep300, Nap1l1, 
Ncoa1, and Tspan12), a pathway implicated in HLHS10,11, were identified. Network 
analysis12 identified seven interconnected functional modules (0.64 modularity; 2.7 scaled 
modularity) significantly different from random networks (0.59 ± 0.019 modularity (n =

 1,000, mean ± s.d.); P value = 0.003) (Supplementary Fig. 3). These results suggested that 
HLHS may involve disturbance of the cell cycle (KIFC3 and CDK1); muscle differentiation 
(TRIM63); mitochondrial and Notch signaling (STAT3, EGFR, and EP300); EGF, Wnt, and 
cadherin signaling (EGFR and CTNNB1); chromatin regulation (EP300); and cardiac 
hypertrophy (TRIM63, EGFR, and SLC4A1) (Supplementary Data 2). Five HLHS mouse 
lines had mutations in two or more genes in 10 of 14 human chromosome intervals 
associated (log of odds (lod) >2) with HLHS and LV outflow obstruction5–7 (Fig. 1e). 
Significant enrichment was observed when two or more mouse HLHS genes were 
interrogated across the intervals (odds ratio (OR), 322.5; confidence interval (CI), 24.9–
4,177.2; P = 5.6 × 10−10), thus supporting multigenic etiology for HLHS (Fig. 1f).
The Ohia line with two founder HLHS mutants contained five homozygous mutations 
(Supplementary Data 1 and Supplementary Fig. 1), only two of which are required for 
HLHS (Table 1): a splice-site mutation in Sap130, which encodes a Sin3A-associated 
protein in the histone deacetylase complex13,14, and a missense mutation in Pcdha9, which 
encodes the cell-adhesion protein protocadherinA9 (Supplementary Fig. 4a,b). Both genes 
are expressed in the embryonic heart (Supplementary Fig. 4e,h–l). Ohia showed 
transmission of HLHS and related CHD phenotypes, including isolated hypoplastic LV or 
aorta, and outflow malalignment defects. Some mutants had a double-outlet right ventricle 
(RV) with hypoplastic LV and normal aorta, or hypoplastic aorta and normal LV (Table 1 
and Supplementary Fig. 5a–c), thus indicating that, in contrast to a previous suggestion15, 
hemodynamic factors are not primary drivers of HLHS. In agreement with this conclusion, 
fetal echocardiography from embryonic day (E) 13.5–18.5 showed that only right-sided 
heart structures grew in HLHS fetuses, whereas right and left cardiac chambers and valves 
grew steadily in normal littermates (Supplementary Videos 1 and 2 and Supplementary Fig. 
5d,e). HLHS mutants exhibited poor LV contractility (Supplementary Fig. 5f) with abnormal 
left-to-right flow through the foramen ovale (Supplementary Video 1). Premature foramen 
ovale closure and restriction, as previously hypothesized to cause LV hypoplasia, was not 
observed (Supplementary Fig. 5g).
HLHS exhibited the highest penetrance in Sap130m/m; Pcdha9m/m mutants. Penetrance 
decreased by half in Sap130m/m; Pcdha9m/+ mutants and ninefold in Sap130m/m; Pcdha9+/+ 
mutants (Table 1). CHD comprising isolated hypoplastic LV was observed in only 
Sap130m/m mutants (Table 1). Pcdha9m/m mutants demonstrated normal-sized LV with 
isolated aortic hypoplasia and aortic stenosis and bicuspid aortic valves (BAV), phenotypes 
linked to HLHS5 (Fig. 2a–c and Table 1). These findings were accompanied by cardiac 
hypertrophy, which was probably secondary to the aortic stenosis (Supplementary Videos 5–
7). This same phenotype was observed with increased penetrance in Pcdha9m/m; Sap130m/+ 
mutants (25% versus 11%; Table 1). In single mutants or double-heterozygous Sap130; 
Pcdha9 mutants, no CHD was observed. Overall, HLHS appeared to arise from synergistic 
interactions between the Sap130 and Pcdha9 mutations, and HLHS was significantly 
enriched in Sap130m/m; Pcdha9m/m mutants.
The role of Sap130 and Pcdha9 mutations in causing HLHS was confirmed with CRISPR–
Cas9 gene editing16. Analysis of 90 E14.5 F0 CRISPR embryos showed that 52 had at least 
one gene-targeting event (Supplementary Fig. 6). Of these 52 embryos, 19 exhibited muscle-

 bound hypoplastic LV with MV stenosis and/or hypoplastic aorta (Supplementary Fig. 7). In 
one double-gene-targeted embryo, HLHS was observed with hypoplastic LV, aortic valve 
and MV, and bicuspid aortic stenosis (Supplementary Fig. 7, CC-74). Several Pcdha9-
targeted F0 embryos had hypoplastic LV and MV, a result probably reflecting tissue 
mosaicism commonly observed in F0 CRISPR animals17,18. One CRISPR mouse line 
showed germline transmission of doubly targeted Pcdha9 and Sap130 alleles. This line 
expressed the same anomalously spliced Sap130 transcript encoding the 36–amino acid in-
frame deletion seen in Ohia mutants (Supplementary Figs. 4d and 8). The Pcdha9 allele 
comprised a single in-frame amino acid insertion with a deletion of two adjacent amino 
acids near the site of the Ohia Pcdha9 missense mutation (Supplementary Fig. 8). F1 
intercrosses yielded HLHS in double-homozygous F2 offspring, thus confirming the 
sufficiency of CRISPR-targeted Sap130 and Pcdha9 mutations in causing HLHS (Fig. 2d,e, 
Supplementary Figs. 1 and 8, and Supplementary Videos 8 and 9). These findings suggested 
that the Ohia and CRISPR Pcdha9 mutations are both likely to be loss-of-function 
mutations.
Using a Sap130-lacZ-knockout (KO) first allele (KOMP Repository; URLs), we found that 
Sap130 is broadly expressed in development (Supplementary Fig. 4f). Homozygous Sap130 
KO (Sap130−/−) and compound heterozygous Sap130 KO; Ohia (Sap130−/m) mice exhibited 
peri-implantation lethality, thus suggesting that the Sap130Ohia allele is hypomorphic 
(Supplementary Table 2). In agreement with these findings, staining with antibody to 
Sap130 revealed strong nuclear localization in the Sap130m/m and wild-type heart tissue 
(Supplementary Fig. 4g–i). Zebrafish sap130a antisense-morpholino knockdown revealed a 
small-ventricle phenotype at 72 h postfertilization, when the heart comprises only first-heart-
field derivatives equivalent to mouse LV progenitors (Supplementary Fig. 9a–c). 
Quantification showed a decrease in ventricular cardiomyocytes (Supplementary Fig. 9d). 
The same small-ventricle phenotype was observed with 36% penetrance in maternal–zygotic 
zebrafish embryos homozygous for a CRISPR-targeted sap130a loss-of-function allele (Fig. 
2f and Supplementary Fig. 9e,f). Together with the isolated hypoplastic LV observed in 
Sap130Ohia mutants (Table 1), these findings indicated that Sap130 is essential for LV 
growth.
Ohia-mutant hearts exhibited increased phosphorylated histone 3 (PH3) and TUNEL 
labeling, but decreased Ki67-positive cardiomyocytes in HLHS LV (Fig. 3 and 
Supplementary Fig. 10). Mitotic cardiomyocytes in anaphase–telophase were decreased 
(Fig. 3c). Together, these results indicated cell-cycle arrest, in agreement with findings from 
a previous HLHS human study19. Electron microscopy indicated a cardiomyocyte 
differentiation defect with short myofilament bundles and more branching and poorly 
defined Z bands in the HLHS LV myocytes (Fig. 3e,f and Supplementary Fig. 11). The 
HLHS RV showed similar but milder changes (Supplementary Fig. 12). Mitochondria in the 
HLHS LV had a low-density matrix with fewer cristae (Fig. 3e,f), as well as shape changes 
and decreased size; together, these observations suggested a mitochondrial maturation defect 
(E13.5 and E16.5; Fig. 3g).
RNA-seq transcriptome profiling in the HLHS LV (Supplementary Data 3) showed changes 
in metabolic and mitochondria-related pathways, including TGFβ, Wnt, and ErbB signaling;

 cancer pathway; calcium signaling; cardiac muscle contraction; and dilated/hypertrophic 
cardiomyopathy (Fig. 4a and Supplementary Data 4). HLHS RV analysis yielded similar 
pathways with lower fold changes (Fig. 4b and Supplementary Data 4). Sap130 chromatin 
immunoprecipitation sequencing (ChIP–seq) to identify Sap130 targets yielded many of the 
same pathways, including TGFβ, Wnt, and ErbB signaling (Fig. 4c,d and Supplementary 
Data 5). Notable among the Sap130 targets was Meis1, a gene regulating mitochondrial 
metabolism20 and postnatal cardiomyocyte cell-cycle arrest21 (Supplementary Fig. 13). Also 
observed were Notch components known to regulate valve development and ventricular 
compaction22,23 (Rbpj, Mib1, Ep300, and Notch1; Fig. 4c,d and Supplementary Fig. 13). 
Together, the enriched pathways according to RNA-seq and ChIP–seq showed extensive 
overlap with the functional modules recovered from the network analysis of the mouse 
HLHS mutations (Supplementary Fig. 3). ToppGene ToppCluster network analysis24,25 of 
the RNA-seq and ChIP–seq data together identified pathways related to cardiac 
differentiation, including contractile fiber, mitochondria, cation transport and ion channels, 
and calcium binding and signaling from among the downregulated genes, but identified 
developmental pathways including mesenchyme determination, heart development, and 
Wnt, TGFβ, and growth-factor signaling from among the upregulated genes, thus indicating 
dysregulated heart developmental programs (Supplementary Fig. 14 and Supplementary 
Data 6).
To interrogate the molecular mechanisms underlying the Sap130–Pcdha9 interactions, we 
generated a cardiomic expression atlas comprising a compendium of microarray expression 
data from 118 heart-related samples at different stages of development26–33 (Supplementary 
Fig. 15). This analysis showed that Pcdha9 expression was largely restricted to an E9.5 
cardiac cushion comprising the valve anlage, whereas Sap130 was broadly expressed 
(Supplementary Fig. 15 and Supplementary Data 7). Pcdha9 and Sap130 expression in the 
cardiac cushions was confirmed by real-time PCR (Supplementary Fig. 15). Importantly, the 
Pcdha9-co-regulated genes included many associated with cardiac valve development, 
including Notch signaling, epithelial–mesenchymal transformation (EMT), and 
mesenchymal-cell differentiation (Supplementary Figs. 16 and 17). Also observed were 
genes related to cartilage and bone development, in agreement with known overlap between 
cartilage/bone and valve developmental pathways34. Recovery of neural crest–related genes 
reflected the known contribution of the cardiac neural crest in valve development35,36. In 
contrast, Sap130 co-regulated genes were associated with the mitotic cell cycle, mitotic 
checkpoint control, and chromatin-regulatory components (Eed, Ezh2, and Suz12) of the 
Polycomb repressive complex 2 (PRC2). Notably, previous studies have shown that the 
repressor SIN3A, histone deacetylase (HDAC), PRC2, and lysine-specific demethylase 1 
(LSD1) play important roles in cadherin repression regulating EMT37–39. These findings 
suggest that Sap130 is essential for epigenetic regulation of EMT. This possibility is 
supported by the presence in the PCDHA gene cluster, of enhancers with SIN3A-binding 
sites and SIN3A-binding sites mapped by ChIP–seq (Supplementary Fig. 18a,b). 
Interestingly, the assembled Sap130 and Pcdha9 networks showed interconnections via 
chromatin and DNA- and histone-modification-related pathways (Supplementary Fig. 17). 
Also observed to interconnect the Sap130 and Pcdha9 networks was Med23, a 
transcriptional coactivator known as a cancer-metastasis-suppressor gene that represses

 EMT40. Together, these findings suggest that Sap130–Pcdha9 interactions may increase 
HLHS penetrance through epigenetic regulation of EMT mediating cardiac valve 
development.
To further examine the genetic etiology of HLHS, we conducted exome sequencing of 68 
subjects with HLHS and identified one SAP130 missense mutation in a highly conserved 
region of the SAP130 protein (Fig. 5a and Supplementary Fig. 19) and 17 PCDHA 
mutations in 15 subjects (Supplementary Table 3). The subject (HLHS-22) with the SAP130 
mutation also had a novel PCDHA13 mutation, a co-occurrence that was unlikely to have 
been by chance (P = 0.0019; Online Methods). As compared against the ExAC database, our 
HLHS cohort exhibited greater than tenfold enrichment in PCDHA gene mutations. The 
PCDHA gene cluster is highly homologous, and the PCDHA13 mutation is situated in a 
region highly conserved across the gene family (Supplementary Fig. 20). Interestingly, a 
16.7-kb deletion spanning PCDHA9 and PCDHA10 is found in multiple human 
populations41. Although this deletion is said to be present in unaffected individuals, BAV is 
typically not diagnosed until late adult life and would not affect reproductive fitness. 
Notably, African Americans have a lower frequency of the PCDHA deletion allele than do 
Europeans, and they also have a lower BAV incidence42 (P = 0.001). Mice with deletion of 
Pcdha2 through Pcdha11 (ref. 43), although viable, have not been examined for cardiac 
phenotype. We found that Pcdha9 mutants with BAV were adult viable. Further studies are 
warranted to determine the risk of BAV in human subjects with the PCDHA-deletion allele.
To assess the multigenic model of disease in HLHS, we interrogated subjects with HLHS for 
multihit genes, i.e., genes encompassing loss-of-function variants found in two or more 
subjects (Supplementary Fig. 21 and Supplementary Data 8). Ancestry-matched 1000 
genomes CEU subjects served as controls44 (Supplementary Fig. 22 and Supplementary 
Data 9). Multihit genes were enriched among subjects with HLHS relative to CEU controls 
(P = 9.1 × 10−24; Fig. 5b and Supplementary Table 4). Mutations from the eight HLHS 
mouse lines were significantly enriched among multihit genes in the subjects with HLHS (P 
= 0.013; Fig. 5b and Supplementary Table 4) but not CEU controls (Fig. 5b). ToppGene 
ToppCluster network analysis of the HLHS mouse and human multihit genes together 
yielded pathways similar to those observed in the Ohia RNA-seq and ChIP–seq analyses 
(Fig. 5c). A notable observation was the recovery of the Notch pathway, given previously 
reported findings of Notch1 variants in subjects with HLHS10,11, with 12 NOTCH-related 
mutations identified in 8 genes from 12 subjects (Supplementary Table 5). Also recovered 
were genes in the TGFβ pathway, with eight mutations in eight subjects (Supplementary 
Table 6). Other pathways identified included mitochondrial related, proliferation and cell 
cycle, cadherin signaling, and chromatin associated, pathways consistent with the Ohia 
mouse-model findings and functional modules identified from mutations recovered from the 
eight HLHS mouse lines (Fig. 5c and Supplementary Fig. 3).
In conclusion, mouse forward genetics facilitated recovery of what are, to our knowledge, 
the first animal models of HLHS. The multigenic etiology is likely to account for the 
previous failure to obtain HLHS mutant mice. Sap130 and Pcdha9 mutations were identified 
and validated as genetic causes of HLHS. This digenic etiology is consistent with a two-
locus model previously proposed for HLHS45. The animal modeling indicated that Sap130

 drives LV hypoplasia by perturbing cardiomyocyte proliferation and differentiation, whereas 
protocadherin mutation drives the aortic valve defects. These findings suggest that HLHS is 
not merely a valve disease46, thereby indicating important therapeutic implications47. The 
incomplete penetrance observed in mice and zebrafish may reflect epigenetic effects, an 
expected result, given that Sap130 is a chromatin-modifying protein. Epigenetics, whose 
critical role in regulating EMT is well described48,49, may affect cardiac valve development 
not only in HLHS but probably also in other CHD. Although environmental effects also may 
contribute to incomplete penetrance, similar results were observed for the mouse and 
zebrafish models with vastly different settings for embryonic development. Together, our 
findings suggest a new paradigm in which modular phenotypes elicited genetically in a 
combinatorial fashion may contribute to the complex genetics of HLHS and perhaps to other 
CHD. These findings provide what is, to our knowledge, the first demonstration of the 
efficacy of mouse forward genetics in interrogating complex genetics. These findings should 
have broad relevance for future studies of not only CHD but also other human diseases.

ONLINE METHODS
Ultrasound and MRI assessment of cardiac structure and function
Mouse studies were conducted under an approved University of Pittsburgh Institutional 
Animal Care and Use Committee protocol. Breeding for the mutagenesis screen was 
conducted with a G2 female × G1 male backcross breeding scheme in C57BL/6J mice8. In 
utero ultrasound scanning was performed with a two-tier ultrasound imaging protocol with 
Acuson Sequoia and Vevo2100 biomicroscopes9. For LV contractility, the areas of the LV 
chamber in diastole (LVEDA) and systole (LVESA) were measured, and the fraction area 
change (FAC%) was calculated as (LVEDA – LVESA) × 100/LVEDA. The foramen ovale 
was imaged by color-flow Doppler in four-chamber view.
Pcdha9m/m adult female mutants and age-matched C57BL/6J female mice (2 months old) 
were ultrasound interrogated, then analyzed with in vivo cine MRI for further hemodynamic 
evaluation with a Bruker 7-Tesla MRI (BioSpec 70/30 USR) with a 35-mm quadrature 
transceiver coil. ECG and respiration-gated multislice cine MRI was acquired with FLASH 
sequence. The equivalent temporal resolution for the cine loops was ~12.8 ms, with 20–24 
phases per cardiac cycle. Cine MRI was acquired with FO, 2.5 cm; slice thickness, 1 mm; 
in-plane resolution, 0.13 mm; TE, 2.26 ms; TR, 12.92 ms; and flip angle, 150.
Episcopic confocal microscopy histopathology
Fetal and neonatal mice with ultrasound findings indicating CHD were necropsied and 
embedded in paraffin for episcopic confocal microscopy (ECM)50 for detailed 
histopathological assessment. The 3D-reconstructed image stacks generated by ECM served

 as the gold standard for CHD diagnosis. Paraffin sections were collected for histochemical 
staining, including Masson’s trichrome staining for cardiac valve analysis.
Mouse whole-exome sequencing
Genomic DNA from HLHS mutant mice were sequence captured with an Agilent SureSelect 
Mouse All Exon kit V1 and sequenced with the Illumina HiSeq 2000 platform (BGI 
Americas) with a minimum average of 50× target-sequence coverage. Sequence reads were 
aligned to the C57BL/6J mouse reference genome (mm9), analyzed with GATK, and further 
processed as previously described8. Genotyping was performed by PCR amplification and 
Sanger sequencing with forward (F) and reverse (R) primers for point mutations in the five 
candidate genes (Supplementary Table 7).
Network functional module analysis
The human interactome was assembled with protein–protein interactions (PPIs) with data 
obtained from BioGRID (URLs)51 and human PPIs from HPRD52 (URLs). We then added 
PPIs predicted by the computational model High Precision Protein-Protein Interaction 
Prediction (HiPPIP)53. Next, we identified network modules among HLHS genes and their 
linker genes with Netbox12. Netbox reports modularity and a scaled modularity score, as 
compared with the modularity observed in 1,000 random permutations of the subnetwork. 
Scaled modularity refers to the s.d. difference between the observed subnetwork and the 
mean modularity of the random networks54. An empirical P value was computed by 
comparing the observed modularity and the modularity of the randomly permuted 
subnetworks.
CRISPR–Cas9 Sap130 and Pcdha9 gene editing in the mouse genome
Individual guides were selected on the basis of proximity to the desired base substitution. 
sgRNA DNA templates were generated by overlapping PCR with a forward primer 
containing a T7 promoter plus the guide sequence and a common reverse primer containing 
the stem loop. Forward guide primers (5′ 3′) are listed in Supplementary Table 7. PCR 
products were subsequently used for in vitro transcription (MegaShort Script; Ambion) to 
generate sgRNAs.
Single-stranded oligonucleotide (ssODN) donors for Sap130 and Pcdha9 were synthesized 
as Ultramers (IDT). The Sap130 (T>C) donor contains only a single-nucleotide substitution 
(underlined) (Supplementary Table 7). The Pcdha9 (C>T) donor carries the desired C>T 
substitution (underlined) and an additional four silent mutations (uppercase) to prevent 
recutting of the targeted allele (Supplementary Table 7). The injected embryos (C57BL/6J) 
were transferred to psuedopregnant mothers, and embryos were collected at E14.5 and 
genotyped from tail-tip DNA with gene-specific primers (Supplementary Table 7). PCR 
products were TA cloned and analyzed by Sanger sequencing. Some litters were allowed to 
deliver, and the resulting F0offspring were further bred to assess germline transmission of 
the CRISPR–Cas9-targeted Sap130 and Pcdha9 alleles.

 Zebrafish antisense-morpholino gene knockdown
The zebrafish experiments were carried out with an approved University of Pittsburgh 
IACUC protocol with the AB* zebrafish strain. Antisense-morpholino oligonucleotides 
(MOs) were designed and purchased from Gene Tools. Sap130a (5 ng) translation blocking 
(Supplementary Table 7) or scrambled MO (5 ng) were injected into one-cell-stage embryos 
carrying the Tg(5.7myl7:nDsRed2)f2 transgene marker labeling cardiomyocyte nuclei with 
DsRed (gift from C.G. Burns)55. At 72 h postfertilization (hpf), injected embryos were 
anesthetized with Tricane, and the hearts were imaged with an Olympus Fluoview FV1000 
MPE multiphoton confocal microscope with a 1.12-NA, 25× ELWD objective with a 750-
nm laser line, and 3-µm optical slices were collected. 3D reconstructions of confocal stacks 
were made with Imaris 8.1.2 X64 software (BITPLANE, Andor) and quantification of red-
labeled cardiomyocyte nuclei was performed interactively on 3D-reconstructed images.
Generation of zebrafish sap130a mutants
gRNAs were designed to target exon2 of the sap130a gene, according to the methods 
described by Gagnon et al.56. Briefly, gRNAs containing the target sequence 
(Supplementary Table 7) were synthesized in vitro and microinjected with codon-optimized 
Cas9 mRNA into one-cell-stage embryos of the AB* zebrafish strain57. F0 founders were 
identified with RFLP analysis (with primers in Supplementary Table 7). F1 mutants were 
confirmed by Sanger sequencing. In one line, pt32a, a 2-bp insertion and 46-bp deletion was 
detected in sap130a and was used to study heart development.
Sap130 immunostaining
IMCD3 cells (from ATCC) and paraffin sections of mouse embryos were immunostained 
with mouse anti-Sap130 antibody (ABMART, custom mouse monoclonal ID 14915-1-2/
C508_130918; 1:500 for immunofluorescence; 1:100 for DAB immunohistochemistry) and 
AF555 donkey anti-mouse IgG (A31570, Life Technologies; 1:2,000). Horseradish 
peroxidase labeling was used for immunodetection of Sap130 in paraffin sections. Anti-
Sap130 antibodies were verified by Sap130 siRNA knockdown analysis (described below).
Sap130 siRNA knockdown
The Sap130 siRNA (GS269003) was obtained from Qiagen. IMCD3 cells were transfected 
with 50 nM Sap130 siRNA with Lipofectamine RNAiMax reagent (Invitrogen), according to 
the manufacturer’s protocol, and incubated for 4 h at 37 °C. Transfected cells were cultured 
with fresh medium at 37 °C. After 24 h, cells were fixed and immunostained with the 
antibody to Sap130.
In situ hybridization
Embryos were fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde–DEPC-treated PBS at 4 °C overnight and 
processed as described previously43. Plasmid for Pcdha9 in situ probes was obtained from T. 
Yagi (Osaka University) and has been described previously43. After in situ hybridization, 
embryos were postfixed in 4% paraformaldehyde at 4 °C overnight, then embedded in O.C.T 
(Tissue-Tek) and cryosectioned at 20 µm.

 Analysis of cardiomyocyte cell proliferation and apoptosis
Cell proliferation was assessed by immunostaining of paraffin sections with antibodies to 
PH3 (Millipore, Ser10, 2664259, 1:100) and Ki67 (Abcam, ab15580, 1:500). 
Cardiomyocytes were identified with monoclonal MF20 antibodies (Developmental Studies 
Hybridoma Bank, AB_2147781, 1:100). Secondary antibodies included AF555 goat anti-
rabbit IgG (A21429, 1:1,000) and AF488 goat anti-mouse IgG2b (A21042, 1:1,000) from 
Life Technologies. DAPI staining allowed for visualization of cell nuclei and cells in 
anaphase or telophase versus prometaphase or metaphase. Apoptosis was analyzed with 
terminal deoxynucleotidyltransferase-mediated dUTP-biotin nick-end labeling (TUNEL) 
with a Roche TUNEL assay kit (12156792910). Sections were imaged with confocal 
microscopy and quantitatively analyzed with ImageJ. Antibody validation is provided on the 
manufacturers’ websites.
Production of Sap130-knockout mice
The Sap130 LacZ-knockout allele (Sap130tm1a(KOMP)Mbp) was obtained from the Knockout 
Mouse Project (KOMP) via the Jackson Laboratory. Sap130-knockout mice were examined 
for β-galactosidase expression through X-gal staining. Briefly, Sap130+/LacZ embryos were 
fixed in 2% paraformaldehyde and 0.2% glutaraldehyde in PBS at 4 °C, rinsed in PBS, and 
X-Gal stained. Embryos were postfixed in 10% formalin.
Electron microscopy analysis
Heart samples (equal numbers of hearts were analyzed for controls and HLHS mutants, with 
n = 2 for E13.5 in 4 independent experiments; n = 2 for E16.5 in 4 independent experiments) 
were fixed in 2% glutaraldehyde and 4% paraformaldehyde in 0.1 M Millonig’s buffer, pH 
7.4, and postfixed in 1% buffered osmium tetroxide, dehydrated in a graded ethanol series, 
and embedded in EPON/Araldite. Thin (70-nm) sections were stained with uranyl acetate/
lead citrate and photographed with a Hitachi 7650 TEM, as previously described58. 
Mitochondrial area (in square micrometers), and aspect ratio (unitless, major axis/minor 
axis, a measure of length and elongation, 1 = a circle) were analyzed with 6,000/7,000× EM 
images with ImageJ, as previously described59,60.
Transcript and RNA-seq analysis
RNA was isolated from RV and LV tissue from embryos at E13.5, E14.5, and E17.5 (three 
total, with one at each stage), and littermate controls (five total, with one at E13.5 and two 
each at E14.5 and E17.5). cDNA was prepared with a high-capacity RNA-to-cDNA kit 
(Applied Biosystems). Real-time PCR was performed with Power SYBR Green PCR Master 
Mix (Applied Biosystems) and an ABI 7900HT Fast Real Time PCR System. The PCR 
primers used are listed in Supplementary Table 7. Expression data were normalized to β-
actin. For splicing analysis, PCR was performed with PrimeSTAR HS DNA Polymerase 
with the primers listed in Supplementary Table 7. Each PCR fragment was gel purified and 
sequenced.
For RNA-seq, libraries were constructed with a TruSeq RNA Sample Preparation Kit v2 
(Illumina) and sequenced with an Illumina HiSeq 2000 platform (BGI Americas) with 100-
bp paired-end reads. The reads were aligned to mm9 (NCBI build 37) with TopHat2

 (v2.0.9)61, and gene-level counts were calculated with HTSeq-count (v0.5.4p5)62. 
Differential expression analyses were performed with edgeR63. Factors of variation were 
assessed via multidimensional scaling, and dispersion parameters were estimated accounting 
for region (LV or RV), stage (E13.5, E14.5, or E17.5), and disease (HLHS or control), and 
their pairwise interactions. For each gene, the maximum of common, trended, and tag-wise 
dispersion estimates was used for subsequent analyses. Differential expression of HLHS LV 
versus control LV, and HLHS RV versus control RV were determined with likelihood-ratio 
tests63. To examine changes in gene expression shared across the three stages, we aggregated 
each sample type (HLHS LV, HLHS RV, control LV, and control RV), and differentially 
expressed genes were recovered for HLHS LV and HLHS RV with false discovery rate 
≤0.05 (Benjamini–Hochberg) and ≥1.5-fold change. KEGG pathway enrichment was 
identified with WebGestalt64 (adjusted P ≤0.05).
ChlP–seq analysis
Sap130 chromatin immunoprecipitation was performed with rabbit anti-Sap130 antibody 
(A302-491A, Bethyl laboratories) and an iDeal ChIP–seq Kit for Transcription Factors 
(Diagenode). Briefly, E12.5 embryonic hearts were homogenized, pelleted, resuspended in 
PBS containing 1% formaldehyde, and then incubated for 20 min. Glycine was added to 
stop cross-linking, and samples were then washed with PBS, resuspended at 4 °C, and 
sonicated to 100- to 300-bp fragments with a Covaris S2 instrument. Sonicated lysates were 
cleared by pelleting of insoluble material and were then incubated with antibody-bound 
Protein A magnetic beads (2 µ;g antibody per 20 µ;l beads) in 300 µl ChIP buffer overnight 
at 4 °C. Immunoprecipitated material was subsequently un-cross-linked in elution buffer, 
extracted with magnetic beads, and resuspended in elution buffer. ChIP–seq libraries were 
generated with an NEBNext Ultra DNA Library Prep Kit Illumina (NEB), and sequencing 
was carried out on an Illumina HiSeq 4000 platform (BGI Americas). Reads were aligned to 
the mouse reference genome (mm10) with Bowtie1 (version 1.1.2)65, and 14,888 potential 
Sap130 peaks were identified with MACS1.4.2 software66. Enriched KEGG pathways were 
identified with WebGestalt (top 4,000 genes selected on the basis of MACS score).
Cardiomic gene expression atlas and Pcdha9–Sap130 interaction analysis
We used microarray data compiled from nine published microarray data sets from the GEO 
database (GSE IDs in Supplementary Data 7) encompassing 29 different sample types and 
118 independent samples profiled on the Affymetrix mouse MOE430 plus 2.0 gene 
microarray platform26–33. CEL files were processed with the RMA algorithm, and gene sets 
were recovered on the basis of filtering for absolute RMA expression levels and Pearson 
correlation of global median-normalized values. Pcdha-related probes were identified on the 
basis of similarity to the expression of the 1420798_s_at probe and were probes contained 
within the 3′ UTR used by multiple members of the Pcdha cluster. Because Pcdha9 
expression was strongest in the E9.5 atrioventricular canal (i.e., AV cushion tissue), we 
filtered for probe sets that exhibited RMA-normalized expression of 8.0 or greater in the 
E9.5 AV canal and identified a Pcdha9-related gene module of 105 probe sets (69 genes) 
with Pearson correlation >0.52. Similarly, a second gene module (150 probe sets, 138 genes) 
that exhibited Sap130-correlated expression in the same samples was identified, and the two 
modules were enriched and compared with ToppCluster.

 Human whole-exome sequencing of subjects with HLHS
All human studies were approved by the Institutional Review Board of the University of 
Pittsburgh, Cincinnati Children’s Hospital Medical Center and University of California, San 
Diego, and appropriate informed consent was obtained. Whole-exome capture was 
performed on 22 subjects with HLHS recruited from Cincinnati, by using NimbleGen EZ 
human Exome V2 with triplex enrichment, and on 46 subjects from Pittsburgh (n = 26) and 
San Diego (n = 20), by using an Agilent V4 Exome Capture kit (23.5% females; dbGAP 
phs001256. v1.p1). Sequencing was performed on the Illumina HiSeq2000 platform with 
100 paired-end reads at 100× coverage. Fastq files of all samples were processed with a 
pipeline as follows: alignment, BWA v0.5.9 with the bwa aln/sampe option; miscellaneous 
BAM file bookkeeping tasks, Picard v1.120.1579; and variant calling and filtering, GATK 
v3.3-0 with GATK′s HaplotypeCaller module. Variants were filtered with GATK′s Variant 
Quality Score Recalibration (VQSR) workflow. Variants that passed VQSR filtration were 
annotated with predicted transcript and protein changes in the UCSC known genes table 
(hg19, accessed 23 November 2015). Variants with predicted loss of function (LOF) 
comprising frameshift, nonsense, or splice site disruption were recovered. Mutations in 
subject HLHS-22 were validated by Sanger sequencing.
Multihit gene analysis in subjects with HLHS and HLHS mouse mutations
The number of genes used for human comparisons was 21,569. For the multihit gene 
analysis, we obtained exome sequencing data from 95 ancestry-matched human CEU control 
subjects from the 1000 Genomes Project (URLs). GATK Select Variants was used to extract 
only the CEU founders from each chromosome’s data set, which were then combined into a 
single VCF.
For this analysis, multihit genes are defined as genes with LOF variants seen in two or more 
subjects (i.e., variant unique to one subject). Subjects with HLHS had 1,736 unique LOF 
variants in 1,278 genes, whereas controls had 1,550 unique LOF variants in 1,372 genes. 
The number of multihit genes was compared with the expected number with 2 × 2 
contingency tables and Pearson χ2 analysis. For sharing within the hHLHS cohort, the 
expected number was based on chance sharing ((frequency of variants per gene)2 × (number 
of possible combinations of 2 out of 68 cases) × (total number of genes)). For sharing within 
controls and within human cohorts (controls + hHLHS, n = 2,345 genes), the expected 
number was based on the proportion of sharing seen within the hHLHS cohort.
For comparison of gene sharing between mice and humans, we identified 16,939 genes 
present in both the mouse and human exome sequencing platforms. The 1,125 LOF variants 
in genes with mouse homologs recovered in the subjects with HLHS were compared with 
the 329 mutations recovered in the eight HLHS mouse mutants. For the control comparison, 
there were 1,149 LOF variants in genes with mouse homologs. Comparison of the overlap 
between the groups was performed with 2 × 2 contingency tables and Pearson χ2 analysis.
ToppFun and ToppCluster network analysis
With a list of known disease-related genes as a training set (‘seeds’), differentially expressed 
genes derived from RNA-seq data obtained from HLHS LV and HLHS RV, and target genes

 identified from Sap130 ChIP–seq were analyzed for functional enrichment with the ToppFun 
application within the ToppGene Suite24,25. Gene rankings of mutations recovered by exome 
sequencing analysis were evaluated with a training set of genes strongly associated with 
cardiac development67 (URLs).
For interactome analysis of genes with unique LOFs, ToppGene also ranked mutations 
recovered from the HLHS mice and subjects with HLHS on the basis of the connectivity of 
their protein–protein interactions, as compared with those in the training gene set. Genes that 
were hit twice in any combination of mouse, human, or mouse–human overlaps were 
subjected to a global multifeature network analysis with ToppGene with gene ontology, 
mouse phenotype, and pathway annotation options. All results were downloaded from 
ToppGene, clustered semantically on the basis of the abstracted annotation terms shown, and 
rendered with Cytoscape68.
Statistics
In animal experiments, sample sizes as small as three animals per group had 80% power to 
detect a 3.04-s.d. unit difference between groups at α = 0.05 with a two sample t-test. This 
effect size was reasonable, given the marked changes observed. The experiments were not 
randomized, though investigators were blinded to allocation during experiments and 
outcome assessments. In all studies, comparison of groups was conducted with unpaired 
Student’s t-test, nonparametric Wilcoxon rank-sum test, or Fisher’s exact test. Statistical 
analysis was performed with SPSS11.5 or SAS. A two-tailed P value <0.05 was considered 
statistically significant. For genotype–phenotype analysis (Table 1), Bonferroni correction 
was applied for six tests (five mouse groups plus an overall group), thus resulting in a P-
value threshold of 0.0125 for significance. All values shown are mean ± s.e.m. except for 
qPCR analyses, which are shown as mean ± s.d.
Enrichment of mouse HLHS genes in human HLHS linkage regions—To 
determine whether mutations (missense, nonsense, splice, or frameshift) in HLHS mouse 
lines might play a role in human HLHS, we examined the overlap of the mouse genes with 
14 human linkage peaks associated with HLHS5–7. The 1-lod-unit support interval of these 
linkage peaks encompassed 290,687,087 bp. Under the assumption that the exome is 1% of 
the genome, there were 2,906,871 potential variants within and 27,093,129 bp outside the 
linkage region. Variants were classified as being inside or outside the linkage region, and 2 × 
2 contingency tables and Pearson χ2 analysis were used to test the significance of 
enrichment of single hits within the linkage region. To test whether animals were more likely 
than chance to have multiple hits, we calculated the probability of a specific base pair to 
have a functional variant (number of variants recovered/number of animals/exome size = 
329/7 × 30,000,000 = 0.000001566). The probability of a mouse having two variants within 
the human linkage intervals equals (the probability of functional variant)2 × number of 
exomal base pairs in linkage interval × number of combinations for average number of 
variants (47) = (0.000001566)2 × 2,906,871 × 1,081 = 0.007705. To determine the 
probability of five of seven HLHS mutant mouse line having two or more putative functional 
variants in the linkage region, binomial distribution was used. To determine the odds ratio, 
the expected number was based on 1/probability of two variants present in the linkage

 interval. The eighth HLHS mutant line, Ohia, was excluded from this analysis, because 
SAP130 and the PCDHA gene cluster are not found in the human linkage intervals.
Co-occurence of SAP130 and PCDHA mutations—To determine the probability of 
co-occurrence of Sap130 and Pcdha double mutations in subjects with HLHS, the rate of 
protein-coding (missense/LOF) variants seen in a cohort of nearly 60,000 people was 
verified in the ExAC database. The frequency of Sap130 protein-coding variants in ExAC 
was 0.0012. Likewise, the frequency of Pcdha protein-coding variants in ExAC was 0.0234. 
Thus, the probability that both alleles would be present in a single individual would be 
0.000028. The probability of seeing at least 1 person out of 68 individuals would be 0.0019.

Ohia HLHS phenotype and mouse HLHS mutations in human HLHS linkage intervals. (a–
d) HLHS phenotype in Ohia mutants. (a,b) Ultrasound color-flow imaging of normal fetus 
(a), showing robust flow from the aorta (Ao) and pulmonary artery (PA). In the HLHS 
mutant (b), the aorta showed only a narrow flow stream, whereas the pulmonary artery 
showed robust flow. 2D imaging revealed hypoplastic LV (b), as compared with the normal-
sized LV in the control (a). (c) Newborn (P0) or E16.5 hearts from wild-type and HLHS 
mutants. Hypoplastic aorta and LV are visible in the HLHS mutant. (d) Histopathology 
showing the cardiac anatomy of HLHS mutant and littermate control at birth (P0) and E14.5. 
Compared with controls, the HLHS mutant exhibited hypoplastic aorta and aortic valve 
atresia, hypertrophied LV with no lumen, and MV stenosis and patent foramen ovale (FO), 
arrowhead. LA, left atrium; RA, right atrium; A, anterior; P, posterior; L, left; R, right; Cr, 
cranial; Cd, caudal. Scale bars: a,b, 0.5 mm; c, 1 mm; d, 0.5 mm. (e) Mouse HLHS 
mutations in human chromosome regions linked to HLHS and left-ventricular outflow tract 
obstruction. Genes recovered from mouse HLHS lines found in human chromosome regions 
linked to HLHS and left-ventricular outflow tract obstructions are shown5–7. The mouse 
chromosome location of each gene is indicated in parentheses. Mouse mutant lines are 
identified with L and a numerical identifier. Chr, chromosome. (f) Enrichment of mouse 
HLHS mutations recovered from seven mutant lines in human chromosome linkage 
intervals. Genes with mouse HLHS mutations in groups of two or more showed significant 
enrichment in the HLHS linkage intervals previously identified5–7 (Pearson chi-squared 
test). This result was not observed for genes analyzed individually, thus indicating that 
HLHS involves multigenic interactions.

versus wild-type mice. Compared with wild type, the mutant mouse showed immature 
thickened aortic valves with increased trichrome staining, thus indicating abnormal matrix 
deposition. (d,e) CRISPR–Cas9-targeted Sap130; Pcdha9 mutants exhibit HLHS. The 
CRISPR-generated F2Sap130m/m; Pcdha9m/m mutant showed a small LV with a small flow 
stream from the ascending aorta. Aortic and pulmonary blood flow originated from the RV, 
thus indicating a double-outlet RV variant of HLHS (supplementary Video 8), as confirmed 
by histopathology showing a small LV with hypoplastic aorta and MV (supplementary Video 
9). (f) CRISPR–Cas9-targeted sap130a zebrafish exhibiting a small ventricle. Maternal–
zygotic (MZ) sap130apt32a/pt32a mutants, compared with wild type, exhibited hearts (H) with

Ohia HLHS mutants show defects in cardiomyocyte proliferation, differentiation, and 
mitochondria. (a,b) Cardiomyocyte proliferation defects in the HLHS heart. Cardiomyocytes 
(MF20 positive) in Ohia HLHS LV, compared with controls, showed increased PH3 but 
decreased Ki67 at E14.5−P0. For RV, a decrease in only Ki67 was observed at E14.5, 
E15.5–E16.5. Equal numbers of embryos were analyzed for HLHS and littermate controls, 
with n = 4 independent experiments for E14.5; n = 3 for E15.5 and E16.5; and n = 3 for 
E18.5 + P0. Wilcoxon rank-sum test in a yielded: E14.5, P = 0.0398 (LV) and P = 0.9248 
(RV); E15.5 + E16.5, P = 0.032 (LV) and P = 0.9081 (RV); E18.5 + P0, P = 0.021 (LV) and 
P = 0.3771 (RV). Unpaired Student’s t-test in b yielded: E14.5, P = 1.6178 × 10−7 (t = 
11.62, df = 11) (LV) and P = 0.000329, (t = 5.338, df = 10) (RV); E15.5 + E16.5, P = 0.032 
(t = 2.374, df = 14) (LV) and P = 0.001 (t = 4.05, df = 14) (RV); E18.5 + P0, P = 0.000067 (t 
= 6.526, df = 10) (LV) and P = 0.278 (t = 1.148, df = 10) (RV). (c) Decrease in mitotic cells 
in anaphase or telophase in HLHS LV. PH3 and DAPI nuclear staining was used to examined 
anaphase and telophase in three E14.5 HLHS and littermate-control heart samples (n = 3 
independent experiments). Total mitotic cells counted: n = 636 control LV, n = 1,347 HLHS 
LV, n = 635 control RV, and n = 567 HLHS RV. Unpaired Student’s t-test yielded P = 0.048 
(t = 2.181, df = 13) (LV) and P = 0.48 (t = −0.726, df = 14) (RV). (d) TUNEL labeling 
shows increased apoptosis in HLHS LV but not RV. Analysis of same samples from a and b. 
Wilcoxson rank-sum test yielded: E14.5, P = 0.0001 (LV) and P = 0.9841 (RV); E15.5 + 
E16.5, P = 0.0122 (LV) and P = 0.6865 (RV); E18.5 + P0, P = 0.0042 (LV) and P = 0.4099 
(RV). (e–g) Electron microscopy showing mitochondrial defects in HLHS LV. Control LV 
(e) and HLHS LV(f) hearts at E13.5 showed HLHS LV with shorter myofibrils with less 
distinct z-bands and fewer cristae (f). Quantification (g) of E13.5 and E16.5 HLHS LV and 
control LV samples showed that mitochondria in the HLHS LV were smaller and elongated 
but became more rounded at E16.5. (Number of mitochondria analyzed (n): E13.5, n = 611 
(control) and n = 238 (HLHS); E16.5, n = 886 (control) and n = 1,241 (HLHS). Wilcoxon 
rank-sum test on mitochondrial area: E13.5, P = 0.000022; E16.5, P = 7.9448 × 10−10. 
Aspect ratio: E13.5, P = 0.00012; E16.5, P = 1.2282 × 10−13. Scale bars, 5 gm (c) and 1 µm

Mutant genes recovered from HLHS mice and subjects with HLHS. (a) SAP130 mutation in 
subject HLHS-22 with HLHS: a missense mutation affects a highly conserved serine residue 
(p.Ser639Gly) (red). (b) Left, 68 subjects with HLHS showed enrichment for multihit genes 
with loss-of-function mutations (plotted as log2 values). This result was not observed for 
multihit genes shared among the CEU control subjects or between the subjects with HLHS 
and the CEU control subjects. Right, mouse HLHS-associated genes were in excess among 
loss-of-function mutations in human subjects with HLHS (plotted as log2 values), but this 
enrichment was not observed in these subjects compared with 95 CEU control subjects 
(Pearson chi-squared test). (c) ToppCluster-generated interactome network of multihit genes 
recovered from subjects with HLHS and HLHS mutant mice. Genes (hexagons) associated 
with heart development and various gene-ontology biological processes (color rectangles) 
are shown with corresponding color. Dark-blue-outlined hexagons are NOTCH-related 
genes. Protein–protein interactions are indicated as solid dark-blue lines between genes.
