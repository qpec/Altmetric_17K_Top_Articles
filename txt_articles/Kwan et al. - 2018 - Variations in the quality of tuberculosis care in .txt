Abstract
Background
India has the highest burden of tuberculosis (TB). Although most patients with TB in India
seek care from the private sector, there is limited evidence on quality of TB care or its corre-
lates. Following our validation study on the standardized patient (SP) method for TB, we
utilized SPs to examine quality of adult TB care among health providers with different qualifi-
cations in 2 Indian cities.
Methods and findings
During 2014–2017, pilot programs engaged the private health sector to improve TB man-
agement in Mumbai and Patna. Nested within these projects, to obtain representative, base-
line measures of quality of TB care at the city level, we recruited 24 adults to be SPs. They
were trained to portray 4 TB “case scenarios” representing various stages of disease and
diagnostic progression. Between November 2014 and August 2015, the SPs visited repre-
sentatively sampled private providers stratified by qualification: (1) allopathic providers with
Bachelor of Medicine, Bachelor of Surgery (MBBS) degrees or higher and (2) non-MBBS
providers with alternative medicine, minimal, or no qualifications.
Our main outcome was case-specific correct management benchmarked against the
Standards for TB Care in India (STCI). Using ANOVA, we assessed variation in correct
management and quality outcomes across (a) cities, (b) qualifications, and (c) case scenar-
ios. Additionally, 2 micro-experiments identified sources of variation: first, quality in the

 presence of diagnostic test results certainty and second, provider consistency for different
patients presenting the same case.
A total of 2,652 SP–provider interactions across 1,203 health facilities were analyzed.
Based on our sampling strategy and after removing 50 micro-experiment interactions, 2,602
interactions were weighted for city-representative interpretation. After weighting, the 473
Patna providers receiving SPs represent 3,179 eligible providers in Patna; in Mumbai, the
730 providers represent 7,115 eligible providers. Correct management was observed in 959
out of 2,602 interactions (37%; 35% weighted; 95% CI 32%–37%), primarily from referrals
and ordering chest X-rays (CXRs). Unnecessary medicines were given to nearly all SPs,
and antibiotic use was common. Anti-TB drugs were prescribed in 118 interactions (4.5%;
5% weighted), of which 45 were given in the case in which such treatment is considered cor-
rect management.
MBBS and more qualified providers had higher odds of correctly managing cases than
non-MBBS providers (odds ratio [OR] 2.80; 95% CI 2.05–3.82; p < 0.0001). Mumbai non-
MBBS providers had higher odds of correct management than non-MBBS in Patna (OR
1.79; 95% CI 1.06–3.03), and MBBS providers’ quality of care did not vary between cities
(OR 1.15; 95% CI 0.79–1.68; p = 0.4642). In the micro-experiments, improving diagnostic
certainty had a positive effect on correct management but not across all quality dimensions.
Also, providers delivered idiosyncratically consistent care, repeating all observed actions,
including mistakes, approximately 75% of the time. The SP method has limitations: it cannot
account for patient mix or care-management practices reflecting more than one patient–
provider interaction.
Conclusions
Quality of TB care is suboptimal and variable in urban India’s private health sector. Address-
ing this is critical for India’s plans to end TB by 2025. For the first time, we have rich mea-
sures on representative levels of care quality from 2 cities, which can inform private-sector
TB interventions and quality-improvement efforts.
Author summary
Why was this study done?
• India accounts for a quarter of the world’s estimated 10.4 million new tuberculosis (TB)
cases per year, nearly a third of the 1.7 million annual TB deaths, and a third of the esti-
mated 4 million “missing patients” who are either not diagnosed or are not reported to
national TB programs.
• The private health sector provides the bulk of primary care in India, serving as the first
point of contact for 50% to 70% of patients with TB symptoms. The private sector com-
prises a wide range of qualification levels: allopathic providers with Bachelor of Medi-
cine, Bachelor of Surgery (MBBS) or higher degrees; Ayurveda, Yoga, Unani, Siddha, or
Homeopathy (AYUSH) practitioners (practitioners with degrees in alternative medicine
or traditional systems of health); and providers with other or no formal qualifications,
who are known to provide a large proportion of primary care.

 • Little is known about quality of TB care in the private sector; however, the Government
of India has prioritized the engagement of the private sector in the National Strategic
Plan (NSP) for TB elimination (2017–2025).
What did the researchers do and find?
• In the 2 Indian cities of Mumbai and Patna, we used a list of all private-sector providers
to construct a representative sample for a quality of care surveillance project using the
standardized patient (SP) method.
• During 2014–2015, the SPs—seemingly healthy adults hired locally and trained to con-
vincingly portray symptoms of illness or test results to providers—conducted a total of
2,652 incognito visits among 1,203 health facilities. SPs portrayed cases representing 4
different stages of TB progression and diagnosis and reported the providers’ actions and
prescriptions for analysis.
• We report 4 novel findings in this publication. First, benchmarked against national and
international standards of TB care, only 35% of interactions resulted in standards-com-
pliant care during a one-time visit to a healthcare provider.
• Second, lack of adherence to TB standards does not represent a typical “alternative” care
pattern that would be appropriate for polluted urban environments because providers
followed multiple different protocols.
• Third, there is a wide range of estimated quality in each qualification stratum, and pro-
viders demonstrate consistency with their own previous behaviors.
• Finally, providers offer more TB-focused care in cases with higher diagnostic certainty
provided by the patient.
What do these findings mean?
• Although the SP method deployed in this study cannot account for patient mix or care-
management practices reflecting more than one patient–provider interaction, we find
that quality of TB care is suboptimal and variable in urban India’s private health sector.
Therefore, improving quality of TB management in the private sector must be a priority
for India’s TB elimination strategy.
• With large-scale, city-level representative estimates, these findings can inform specific
efforts for private-sector TB interventions and quality improvement.
Introduction
India accounts for a quarter of the estimated 10.4 million new tuberculosis (TB) cases world-
wide annually, nearly a third of the 1.7 million annual TB deaths, and a third of the estimated 4
million “missing patients” who are either not diagnosed or are not reported to national TB
programs [1]. Identifying these missing patients with TB, accurately diagnosing patients in a

 timely manner, and providing all patients with quality treatment is critical for reducing TB
incidence and mortality rates [2].
In India, studies have demonstrated that the private health sector provides the bulk of pri-
mary care, is the first point of contact for 50% to 70% of patients with TB symptoms [3–5], and
prescribes nearly twice the amount of anti-TB drugs compared to the public sector [6]. How-
ever, navigating the private health sector can be medically and economically costly: patients
with TB who seek care experience a median of 33.5 days of diagnostic and treatment delays,
convoluted pathways with multiple visits to an average of 3 providers before diagnosis, and a
broken cascade of care even if diagnosed [4,5,7,8]. With the emergence of drug-resistant
strains, these deficits may perpetuate disease transmission and hinder control efforts, particu-
larly for high-density urban areas [9].
The Government of India now recognizes that engaging the private sector is critical to TB
control, and it has included this as an explicit goal in the government’s National Strategic Plan
(NSP) for TB elimination (2017–2025). The NSP articulates a commitment to massively
expand private provider engagement and calls for a 6-fold increase in TB case notifications
from the private sector, to 2 million patients per year by 2020 [10].
One key challenge for any effort that engages the private sector is the wide array of health-
care providers, most of whom are not engaged with India’s Revised National TB Control Pro-
gramme (RNTCP) [11]. The sector comprises providers trained in biomedicine with Bachelor
of Medicine, Bachelor of Surgery (MBBS) or higher degrees (such as MDs and specialized
MDs), practitioners of alternative medicine and healthcare (such as those who hold degrees in
Ayurveda, Yoga, Unani, Siddha, or Homeopathy [abbreviated AYUSH]), informal providers
with minimal or no qualifications, and pharmacists and laboratories.
All private providers with MBBS or higher qualifications can provide TB care, and AYUSH
practitioners, other non-MBBS providers, and pharmacists generally do not treat TB [12–14].
TB medications are included in Schedule H1, a restricted drug list, in India and therefore can
only be dispensed on the basis of prescriptions from MBBS or higher providers. Additional
evidence demonstrates that pharmacists do not dispense TB medications over the counter
[13,14].
In the private sector, there is no uniform diagnostic algorithm that is practiced, and
research demonstrates that providers use diverse approaches (e.g., clinical diagnosis only and
clinical diagnosis with chest X-ray [CXR] confirmation, with infrequent use of microbiological
tests) [12,15]. Xpert Mycobacterium tuberculosis/Rifampicin (Xpert MTB/RIF), also known as
GeneXpert (Cepheid, Sunnyvale, CA), a molecular diagnostic test that detects TB as well as
rifampicin-resistant TB, is available in certain private laboratories, and anecdotal evidence sug-
gests that providers use these diagnostics selectively based on patients’ ability to pay and
patient risk factors, such as suspected drug resistance. Effective private-sector engagement
therefore demands a deep understanding of how private providers behave and what predicts
their practice patterns [11].
Between 2014 and 2016, the Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation India Country Office, along
with city and state governmental partners, funded 2 Private Provider Interface Agency (PPIA)
pilot programs in Mumbai and Patna. The PPIA pilots were private-sector engagement efforts
to increase case notifications and improve TB management. Our study was a part of this larger
effort to improve quality of care in both cities. Using the baseline data from the quality of care
surveillance, the objectives of this study are to answer the following 2 research questions: (1)
what are city-representative levels of quality of TB care in urban India across private provider
qualifications and cities and (2) to what extent can variation in quality of care be explained?
In this study, we build on our extensive prior work that validated the use of the standard-
ized (or simulated) patient (SP) method for assessing TB care quality and for directly

 measuring levels of quality of TB care in India, China, and Kenya [12,14,16–18]. The SP
method, which is considered the gold standard method to assess provider practice, has been
increasingly used to capture levels of quality of care for TB and other health conditions [12,16–
20]. In order to provide city-representative measures on what explains levels of quality, we
report data on 2,602 SP–provider interactions across 1,203 representatively sampled health
facilities in Mumbai and Patna. We additionally report results from 2 micro-experiments
aimed to explain variation in our main outcome of interest: correct case management during a
single encounter with a provider.
Methods
Study settings
We conducted this study in Mumbai and urban Patna, when the 2 PPIA pilots were in the
first year of implementation [21,22]. Patna is the capital of the state of Bihar, one of the least
developed Indian states, with an annual per capita income of 30,000 Indian rupees (INR; US
$470), and urban Patna has a population of 2.049 million city inhabitants (2011 census figure).
Mumbai is the relatively wealthier port capital of the state of Maharashtra and is home to 12
million inhabitants (2011 census figure), with an annual per capita income of 180,000 INR (US
$2,845).
Although both cities have government clinics and hospitals for patients, the mostly unregu-
lated private sector remains the dominant source of primary healthcare. However, the struc-
ture of the private sector is very different across these 2 cities. In Patna, MBBS-qualified
providers tend to operate stand-alone, single-provider clinics, whereas in Mumbai, they work
in several stand-alone, single-provider clinics as well as multiple multiprovider facilities or in
hospitals with a mix of MBBS providers and specialists with higher qualifications. Patna non-
MBBS providers tend to be those with other or no qualifications, whereas in Mumbai, non-
MBBS providers are predominantly AYUSH practitioners. In this paper, we refer to the group
of allopathic providers with MBBS degrees or higher qualifications as “MBBS providers” and
to all others as “non-MBBS providers” regardless of the specific qualifications of the providers,
in accordance with our sampling stratification.
In the TB context, 97,001 patients with TB were officially notified in 2016 in the state of
Bihar, and 195,139 cases were notified in the state of Maharashtra [23]. Because, as studies sug-
gest, most TB cases are treated in the private sector, many other cases are not notified to
national TB authorities, and therefore the above numbers underestimate the extent of the dis-
ease burden. The prevalence of drug-resistant TB strains is increasing in both cities, and drug-
resistance concerns have been prominent in Mumbai, particularly with the emergence of
totally drug-resistant TB strains [24].
Study design
The SP survey methodology consists of 3 steps: creating a sampling frame, measuring quality,
and analyzing the resulting data. We briefly describe each step here, with additional details in
Supporting information (S1–S3 Text).
Provider and facility sampling.
In both Mumbai and Patna, field officers hired by the
PPIAs conducted street-by-street mapping exercises in 2014 to construct a comprehensive,
“universe” list of all providers and facilities across the private health sectors of both cities. Pro-
viders eligible for the SP study were restricted to those known to see adult outpatients with
respiratory symptoms in the private health sector. These include most primary care providers
but exclude, for instance, orthopedists, gynecologists, ophthalmologists, and pediatricians.
Using the universe list, we then representatively sampled eligible providers from purposively

 sampled geographical areas within each city, which were identified with implementation part-
ners for the SP study in the context of the PPIA pilot programs. Providers were selected with
random sampling stratified by PPIA program enrollment status and provider qualification
(Table 1). This was done to estimate baseline measures for quality of TB care in these cities
and, in ongoing work, evaluate the impact of the programs (see S1 Text) (we note that a strati-
fied analysis by PPIA versus non-PPIA is not a focus of this paper but a focus of the larger
impact evaluation study that is ongoing). In Mumbai, we sampled 331 MBBS facilities and 500
non-MBBS providers, and in Patna, we sampled 471 MBBS and 120 non-MBBS providers (S7
Fig). To estimate baseline quality measures, the data were weighted according to appropriate
sampling proportions in both cities (S2 Text).
SP cases were then assigned to providers to ensure that (a) providers of all types would
receive a mix of multiple SP case scenarios and (b) the risk of detection would be minimized
(i.e., in order to minimize the likelihood of providers being suspicious of SPs or detecting SPs
as not real patients, the schedule for SP visits were conducted such that providers would not
receive more than 2 SP cases within 5 days of each other and that Case 1 would visit before
Cases 2–4 in order to prevent any potential priming effect from a provider seeing a more
advanced or obvious TB case before a less advanced one).
Interaction completion rates were uniformly high, with only Patna MBBS, non-PPIA pro-
viders having less than 85% of initially scheduled providers successfully visited (this proportion
was 71%, due to many being discovered as specialized practitioners who did not treat respira-
tory conditions). When interactions could not be completed at an initially scheduled provider,
they were completed at an identically sampled replacement if possible (S1 Text); therefore, the
total number of unique providers in the data is greater than the number initially sampled.
Each provider in our sample received up to 4 SP visits at a given location.
Measuring quality using SPs.
The advantages of SP-based measures of medical care qual-
ity in general [16,25] and for TB specifically have been discussed previously [12,14]. For this
study, 4 distinct SP cases were developed and agreed upon by a Technical Advisory Group
(TAG) made up of clinicians, economists, anthropologists, experts in international and
national TB guidelines, and other stakeholders (S1 Text), after which the cases were validated
in a pilot study [12]. Our main outcome, correct management, was benchmarked against the
Standards for TB Care in India (STCI) and the International Standards for TB Care (ISTC)
and was agreed upon by the TAG [26,27] (Table 2). Each case was developed with a standard-
ized opening statement and scripted presentation that would advance the provider towards a
TB diagnosis and an appropriate case management action, which could include referral, labo-
ratory testing, or treatment initiation, depending on the case scenario.
Cases 1, 2, and 3 represented adult pulmonary TB at various stages of diagnostic certitude.
Case 1 presents as a classic case of pulmonary TB with 2 to 3 weeks of cough and fever. Case 2
is similar to Case 1; however, the SP additionally has completed a 1-week course of broad-spec-
trum antibiotics without any improvement and carries an abnormal CXR dated within 2
weeks of the interaction. Case 3 has visited the local government hospital and carries the
results of a sputum smear microscopy acid-fast bacillus (AFB) test, which is positive for active
TB.
Similar to previously published SP studies, the SPs in this study were recruited from the
local community, hired, and extensively trained to present the same case to multiple providers.
Interaction details were recorded by field supervisors in a structured exit questionnaire within
1 to 2 hours after each visit. For this study, a total of 24 SPs (7 females and 17 males) were
recruited, trained, and hired as staff (see S1 Text for a further description).
In all scenarios in which the SP carried medical reports or images, the SPs conveyed to the
provider that they did not know or understand what the reports showed—thereby varying the

tions. To assess the extent to which provider behavior is consistent across patients with identi-
cal presentations, 109 of the Case 1 interactions in Patna were completed at providers who had
already completed a Case 1 interaction with a different SP actor.
Case 4 presents as an adult multidrug resistant (MDR) TB suspect with 4 weeks of cough
and fever. The SP recalls receiving treatment from the government hospital in the past year for
a similar condition and, if questioned, admits to not completing the TB treatment during the
previous episode. All flags point towards TB recurrence, which should raise concern about
drug resistance. Among 50 of the sampled Mumbai MBBS or higher providers, we randomly
assigned SPs to present an experimental variant of Case 4, who carried the same TB-positive

 sputum AFB report as in Case 3. With this variant, we aimed to analyze the effect of a TB-posi-
tive diagnostic test signal by comparing quality of care provided to SPs portraying Case 4 with
versus without the AFB report.
To facilitate outcome assessment for each interaction, labeled medicines and prescriptions
given to the SPs were coded into 4 categories: anti-TB drugs, fluoroquinolone (FQ) antibiotics,
other broad-spectrum antibiotics, or steroids. Coding was done independently by 2 doctors
with expertise in TB (SS) and infectious diseases (RS). We chose to retain FQs as a distinct
category of antibiotics because they can mask the presence of TB, rendering diagnosis more
difficult, and can lead to delays in diagnosis [28]. Additionally, in Mumbai, providers often
dispensed loose, unlabeled pills to the SPs. To properly identify these pills, we employed 2
pharmacists who worked independently to code them. On the basis of their assessments, we
determined whether the variety of medicines given for each interaction included at least 1
broad-spectrum antibiotic and/or at least 1 steroid.
In addition to reporting the details of case management, each interaction was broadly clas-
sified as “correctly managed” or not, according to the STCI [29]. Taking a lenient approach,
providers were not penalized for the use of unnecessary or even potentially harmful medicines,
and thus the results presented are upper-bound estimates of quality, as measured by adherence
to TB standards of care. The definitions of correct management are detailed in Table 2, and
the levels of prescribing and dispensing medications are analyzed in the Appendix (S3 Text).
S1 Fig elaborates on the “lenient” approach, illustrating the proportion of our “correct man-
agement” providers who would have been considered not correct if we had penalized other
medications.

SP Case
Case Description
Presentation of Patient
Expected Correct Case Management
Case 1: Naïve
Suspected TB
Classic case of presumed TB with 2–3 weeks
of cough and fever.
Presents with presumptive TB, for the first time,
to a private healthcare provider, saying “Doctor,
I have a cough that is not getting better and
some fever too.”
Recommendation for sputum testing, chest
radiograph, or referral to a public DOTS center
or a private provider or specialist
Case 2:
Suspected TB
with Abnormal
CXR
Classic case of presumed TB in a patient who
has had 2–3 weeks of cough and fever. The
patient has taken a broad-spectrum antibiotic
(amoxicillin) given by another healthcare
provider for 1 week with no improvement.
He also carries an abnormal CXR suggestive
of TB.
Presents after an initial, failed (empirical)
treatment for symptoms with broad-spectrum
antibiotics and a diagnostic CXR, saying “I have
a cough and fever which is not getting better. I
went to a doctor and took the medicines he gave
me and have also had an X-ray done.” The CXR
and blister pack for the antibiotics are shown if
the provider asks.
Recommendation for sputum testing, chest
radiograph, or referral to a public DOTS center
or a private provider or specialist
Case 3: TB Case
Chronic cough with a positive sputum smear
report for TB from a public health facility.
Presents with evidence of microbiologically
confirmed TB, saying “I have had a cough for
nearly a month now and also have fever. I
visited [the local government hospital] and they
gave me some medicines and did a sputum test.”
The sputum report is shown if the provider asks.
Either referral to a public DOTS center, a private
provider or specialist, or (in the case of a
qualified private provider) initiation of
treatment with standard, 4-drug, first-line anti-
TB therapy (HRZE regimen)
Case 4:
Suspected MDR
Chronic cough and, if asked, elaborates a
history of previous, incomplete treatment for
TB, which would raise the suspicion of MDR
TB.
Presents as a previously treated patient with TB
with recurrence of the disease (i.e., suspicion of
drug resistance), saying “Doctor, I am suffering
from a bad cough. One year ago, I got treatment
in [the local public hospital], and it had gotten
better. But now I am having cough again.”
Recommendation for any DST (culture, line
probe assay, or Xpert MTB/RIF) or referral to a
public DOTS center or to a private provider or
specialist

 Analysis.
We report raw proportions for outcomes of interest, with population mean
estimates and CIs computed using inverse probability weighting. Based on the universe of
private-sector providers listed from the mapping exercise in both cities (S1 and S2 Text),
these weights are calculated such that each of the 8 city–case combinations contribute equally
to overall estimates. Within each city–case combination, individual interactions are weighted
based on the actual proportion of providers enrolled and not enrolled in the PPIA in that
city’s provider sampling list within both the MBBS and non-MBBS strata versus the realized
sample.
Therefore, the percentages reported for case management behaviors represent the esti-
mated likelihood of the outcome occurring if a provider were chosen at random from the
citywide population of providers rather than the percentage of interactions in our sample
in which the behavior was observed. In addition to using these weights to estimate popula-
tion likelihoods, we use them to calculate weighted odds ratios (ORs) in logistic regressions
comparing variation in quality of care across provider types, city settings, and SP case
scenarios.
In Supporting information (S3 Text), we present an ANOVA analysis, which was not pre-
specified, to determine how well our primary stratification characteristics explain variations
in SP management. Among the sampled providers who received repeat Case 1 visits in
Patna, we assess the level of consistency that those providers displayed across identical SP
Case 1 visits using a different SP actor. We then use a quality proxy—checklist of history
questions—to illustrate the amount of variation in provider behavior within each city–case
combination.
In addition to the ANOVA analysis, we include the outcome of whether an SP was asked to
return, which was not prespecified and requested during peer review. Considering that the
data for this analysis are a subset of the data generated from a larger research project, we did
not encounter any other deviations from the stated prospective analysis plan within the
research protocol submitted to the ethics committees (S4 Text). All analyses and programs
were written in Stata 14 (Stata, College Station, TX).
Ethical approvals
Ethical approvals for this study were granted by the McGill University Health Centre in
Montreal, Canada (REB No. 14-137-BMB) and the Subcommittee for the Ethical Approval
of Projects at the Institute for Socioeconomic Research on Development and Democracy in
Delhi, India. All SPs were hired as staff and received training and refresher trainings to pro-
tect themselves from potentially harmful events, such as injections during their interactions.
For this study, a waiver of provider informed consent was sought with particular attention
to the research ethics provisions under the Government of Canada Panel on Research Ethics,
as well as a recent study by Rhodes and colleagues (2012) on ethical aspects of simulated
patient studies commissioned by the US Department of Health and Human Services [30].
Supported by findings from the validation of the SP method for TB in urban India as
reported in Das and colleagues (2015) [12], both ethics committees approved a waiver of
provider informed consent in Mumbai and Patna because (1) the combination of informed
consent and congregation of providers during association meetings and in the implementa-
tion of TB interventions that occurred during the study period posed threats to the scientific
validity of the study objectives as well as to the risk of SP detection and (2) there is no more
than minimal risk of participation to the SPs or providers [12]. Additional information on—
including the rationale behind and approval of—the waiver of provider informed consent is
detailed in S1 Text.

 Results
The results are presented in 3 sections. In the first section, we describe overall standards of
care, focusing on correct case management, medicine use, and laboratory tests. In the second
section, we document variation in the data by provider qualification and city. In the third sec-
tion, we document variation across SP cases, focusing on the role of diagnostic certainty.
Practice quality overview
In our study, 1,288 distinct provider practices were successfully visited by SPs at 1,203 health
facilities across both cities. Among these providers, the majority were male (88%), had a clinic
assistant (65%), and fell into the age category of 30–50 years (71%), which were all characteris-
tics observed by SPs during the interactions. Fig 1 illustrates our main city-level estimates of
average case management outcomes among the city-representative sample, with proportions
estimated with weights to represent the estimated likelihood of the outcome occurring if a pro-
vider was visited by a patient at random from the citywide population of providers.
Among 2,602 SP interactions, 959 were correctly managed (35%; 95% CI 32%–37%), and
536 of 2,602 interactions (29%; 95% CI 26%–31%) had any diagnosis given to the patient.
Among the 959 correctly managed interactions, 260 (37%; 95% CI 32%–42%) received any
diagnosis. Among the correctly managed interactions, a greater proportion of providers
ordered a CXR (677 of 959 [53%; 95% CI 48%–57%]) or referred the SP for further care (194
of 959 [36%; 95% CI 31%–40%]) than ordered a microbiological test for diagnosis (318 of 959

 [31%; 95% CI 27%–36%]). Among the 194 referrals, 52% were to the private and 48% to the
public sector.
Microbiological testing, including drug susceptibility testing (DST), was relatively infre-
quent across all case scenarios. Sputum smear testing was ordered in 389 of 2,602 (18%; 95%
CI 16%–20%), sputum culture in 28 of 2,602 (2%; 95% CI 1%–3%), and Xpert MTB/RIF in 108
of 2,602 interactions (2%; 95% CI 1%–3%). For Case 2, when the SP carried an abnormal CXR
suggestive of TB, 45 of 385 SP interactions (7%; 95% CI 4%–10%) resulted in any DST, while
99 of 385 were ordered a new CXR (25%; 95% CI 20%–30%). Similarly, of 486 interactions in
which the SP presented with recurrent TB and suspected MDR-TB (Case 4), 26 were recom-
mended any DST (3%; 95% CI 1%–5%).
Medicines were very frequently prescribed or dispensed, and we did not count the use of
additional or unnecessary medications against the provision of correct management. At least 1
medication was prescribed or dispensed in 2,239 of 2,602 interactions (79%; 95% CI 76%–
82%), with an average of 3.11 medications per interaction (95% CI 2.99%–3.23%). Across all
2,602 interactions, broad-spectrum antibiotics other than FQs were given in 1,227 (39%; 95%
CI 36%–42%), FQ antibiotics in 328 (15%; 95% CI 13%–17%), and steroids in 164 interactions
(6%; 95% CI 5%–7%).
The use of anti-TB medications was minimal and was mostly limited to MBBS-qualified
providers. Anti-TB medications were prescribed in 118 of 2,602 interactions (5%; 95% CI 4%–
6%), with MBBS or higher providers accounting for 112 of those 118 instances. Among the
118 TB prescriptions, 113 included correct isoniazid, rifampicin, pyrazinamide and ethambu-
tol (HRZE) prescriptions—1 of these additionally included the second-line drug clofazimine,
and 2 also included streptomycin. Among the 5 instances that did not include HRZE, 4 were
HRE, and 1 was the second-line medication cycloserine prescribed alone.
In contrast with correctly managed interactions, interactions in which correct case manage-
ment was not observed did not demonstrate any kind of consistent “alternate” protocol that
could theoretically be justified in a polluted urban environment that can result in non-specific
respiratory symptoms like cough. Given a patient with a 2- or 3-week cough in a polluted city
like Patna, providers could, for example, be observed to adopt a “wait-and-see” approach by
offering palliative symptomatic care and asking the patient to return after a few days, even
though this practice technically falls short of the international and national standards of TB
care we used to benchmark management in this study.
We do not observe this type of concentration on a single alternative protocol in our data.
For example, of the 834 Case 1 interactions that were not correctly managed (Fig 2), 183 (22%)
received only a non-FQ broad-spectrum antibiotic; 294 (35%) received a non-FQ broad-spec-
trum antibiotic as well as an FQ, steroid, and/or cough syrup; 185 (22%) received 1 or more of
those medications without a non-FQ broad-spectrum antibiotic; and 172 (21%) received
something else entirely (or nothing at all).
Variation by qualification and setting
One potential explanation is that the wide variation in management reflects systematic practice
variation by qualification and/or setting, and we turn to this hypothesis next. Fig 3 reports
ORs for differences in quality of care outcomes by qualification (top panel) and by city strati-
fied by qualification (middle and bottom panels). MBBS providers, who make up 58% of all
providers in the Patna sampling list and 50% of all providers in the Mumbai list, were more
likely than non-MBBS providers to correctly manage cases (weighted OR 2.80; 95% CI 2.05–
3.82; p < 0.0001), ask for CXR and/or sputum tests, and initiate anti-TB treatment. Despite
providing relatively higher-quality care, MBBS providers only correctly managed 709 of 1,304

 interactions (54% of interactions; 95% CI 52%–57%). MBBS providers were also more likely
than others to prescribe unnecessary or harmful antibiotics, including FQs, although their use
of steroids was notably lower.
Additional analysis in S6 Fig shows that the differences between AYUSH and other non-
MBBS providers in Patna, where both practice, were surprisingly small. In fact, AYUSH pro-
viders were less likely than others to manage or refer cases according to STCI, although the
others gave more unnecessary antibiotics. Use of nonallopathic medications was also diverse.
For example, although most non-MBBS providers in our Mumbai sample are AYUSH, only 63
of 996 non-MBBS SP interactions in Mumbai (6%; 95% CI 4%–8%) involved explicitly labeled
homeopathic or Ayurvedic medicines. By contrast, non-MBBS providers in Patna used labeled
Ayurvedic or homeopathic medicines in 113 of 302 interactions (41%; 95% CI 33%–49%).

 Differences in case management were smaller across the 2 cities. Across all cases, Mumbai
non-MBBS providers were more likely than Patna non-MBBS providers to correctly manage
cases (weighted OR 1.79; 95% CI 1.06–3.03; p = 0.0293), primarily by ordering CXR (weighted
OR 3.62; 95% CI 1.85–7.10; p = 0.0002). Most other behaviors were not significantly different
across the cities. MBBS-qualified providers were even more similar across cities in terms of
correct management (weighted OR 1.15; 95% CI 0.79–1.68; p = 0.4642), with the notable
exception that Mumbai MBBS providers utilized Xpert MTB/RIF testing much more fre-
quently than MBBS providers in Patna (weighted OR 8.60; 95% CI 2.83–26.10; p = 0.0001).
Both MBBS and non-MBBS providers in Mumbai were less likely to prescribe FQs than Patna
providers (weighted OR 0.4; 95% CI 0.24–0.66; p = 0.0004, and 0.25; 95% CI 0.15–0.45;
p < 0.0001, respectively), and the dispensing or prescribing of steroids and broad-spectrum
antibiotics did not differ systematically across the 2 cities.
ANOVA decomposition (S3 Fig) shows that our primary stratification characteristics of
qualification and setting typically predicted less than 25% of the observed variation in each of
our primary case management outcomes with the exception of correct case management and
ordering a CXR (for which 25%–50% of observed variation was predicted). By contrast, in a
subsample in which 109 Patna providers received a repeat Case 1 interaction (S4 Fig), consis-
tency levels between the 2 visits were near 75% for all behaviors. Therefore, we observe that
practice is highly variable across providers, but setting and qualification strata can explain only
a fraction of the wide variety in management practices.
Using essential-history checklist completion as a proxy for the distribution of individual-
ized quality levels (S5 Fig), our results suggest that there is a substantial and unexplained idio-
syncratic component to quality that varies widely even within each city and qualification level.
Rather than tight clustering around the group means, in all cases, we observe a “fat tail” of
both low- and high-quality MBBS and non-MBBS providers in each city. Thus, moving
beyond averages to full distributions of quality yields important and nuanced additional results
for the estimation of “average” outcome quality, both by city and by qualification.
When do providers perform better? Variation by SP case
The final source of variation we assess is the SP case presentation itself. In our previous work
[14], we found that pharmacists were more likely to correctly manage a case if SPs carried a
TB-positive diagnostic test, even as the SP made it clear that she did not know what the results
of the test meant. The SP cases presented in this study reflect a similar design, with the varied
presentation intended to exogenously adjust the providers’ initial degree of certainty about the
patient’s true diagnosis. When the SP carried either an abnormal CXR (Case 2) or an AFB-pos-
itive sputum report (Case 3), providers were observed to be more likely to order tests consis-
tent with a suspicion of TB compared to the Case 1 presentation.
In Case 2, in which the SP carried an abnormal CXR, a second CXR (which would ostensi-
bly provide no new information) was ordered in 99 of 385 instances (25%; 95% CI 20%–30%).
In Case 3, in which the SP carried a TB-positive sputum AFB report, 208 of 354 were recom-
mended a CXR (56%; 95% CI 49%–63%), and 54 of 354 were ordered a new AFB smear (16%;
95% CI 11%–21%). In terms of inappropriate behaviors, variation across SP case had some
impact on the use of inappropriate medications, but it did not reduce it anywhere close to 0 in
any case (S1 Fig). Prescribing unnecessary medicines ranged from 284 of 385 instances in Case
2 (72%; 95% CI 67%–77%) to 1,290 of 1,377 instances in Case 1 (93%; 95% CI 91%–95%). Use
of broad-spectrum antibiotics ranged from 105 of 385 Case 2 interactions (29%; 95% CI 23%–
34%) to 799 of 1,377 Case 1 interactions (53%; 95% CI 50%–57%), and use of FQs ranged from

 43 of 385 Case 2 interactions (12%; 95% CI 8%–16%) to 52 of 354 Case 3 interactions (19%;
95% CI 13%–25%).
Fig 4 highlights selected cross-case variation using logistic regressions. The figure reports
estimated differences between Case 1 and Case 3, using only providers who received both
cases. It also reports differences observed in Case 4 against our alternate version of Case 4 car-
rying the same TB-positive sputum AFB report at identically randomly sampled MBBS-quali-
fied providers in Mumbai, in which the variation in diagnostic certainty is causally identified
through the use of random assignment of the AFB report in an otherwise-identical case
presentation.
Carrying a positive sputum report in Case 3 was associated with an increase in the fre-
quency of CXRs (OR 3.13; 95% CI 1.98–4.96; p < 0.0001) and sputum AFB tests (OR 2.45;
95% CI 1.34–4.47; p = 0.0035), as well as a nonsignificant increase in Xpert MTB/RIF tests (OR
3.88; 95% CI 0.81–18.49; p = 0.0888) and referrals (OR 8.69; 95% CI 3.25–23.2; p < 0.0001)
compared to the same providers’ behavior in the Case 1 interactions. In the experimental com-
parison in which only the diagnostic information was varied for SPs portraying Case 4 while
carrying versus not carrying a TB-positive sputum report (S1 Text), we use the fact that the
report was randomly assigned as indicative of causal impact. Among the 50 instances in which
Case 4 SPs carried a sputum report, the provider saw the report in 45 instances (90%) and
asked detailed questions about the past treatment in 38% of interactions. The results are
broadly similar although nonsignificant: when the Case 4 SP carried the sputum report, correct

 management increased from 29% to 48% (OR 2.22; 95% CI 0.98–5.02; p = 0.0569), largely due
to greater provider use of appropriate DST. Providers’ use of medication also decreased from
86% to 72%, though this was not significant (OR 0.41; 95% CI 0.15–1.12; p = 0.0824). However,
quality improvements were not consistent across all dimensions: the use of first-line anti-TB
medicine, which is not considered correct treatment for a suspected drug-resistant case and
could contribute to greater drug resistance, increased from 2% to 18% when the report was
presented (OR 10.98; 95% CI 1.33–90.24; p = 0.0258).
Discussion
TB is a persistent health challenge for India and is one of the top 5 causes of death between the
age of 30 to 69 [31]. With India’s goal of eliminating TB by 2025 as stated in the NSP, the suc-
cess of this plan heavily depends on whether India’s large, unregulated, and diverse private sec-
tor can be effectively engaged to identify missing patients with TB and ensure that all patients
with TB receive quality TB care [32].
This study extends the evidence from our pilot study that validated the use of the SP
method for assessing TB quality of care in an urban India setting [12] and from our research
on TB-management practices of pharmacists assessed with SPs across 4 Indian cities [13,14].
Our validation study assessed quality of TB care from a purposive provider sample, and with
this study, we were able to further apply the SP method for TB to analyze representative levels
and variation of quality among MBBS and non-MBBS providers in the private health sector of
2 cities. In addition, 2 micro-experiments allow us to better understand the drivers of quality
of care in this setting.
Our city-representative study shows significant deficits in the average provider’s manage-
ment of TB cases in both study cities. This low quality is characterized by underuse of appro-
priate diagnostics and widespread use of unnecessary medications, including antibiotics and
contraindicated FQs. Even though MBBS-qualified providers managed the SP cases better
on average, there was still considerable variation within qualification in each setting and rela-
tively little difference between the 2 cities on average. We further observed that TB-specific
management increased with diagnostic certainty. We also present suggestive evidence that spe-
cific providers adhere consistently to an idiosyncratic protocol when faced with repeated iden-
tical cases. Because providers are making the same mistakes consistently, the SP method
provides novel information to TB-control programs on the specific actions that need to be
improved.
Representing the quality variation during the first year of city-wide private-sector engage-
ment efforts, our data further underscore the need to work with the private sector to improve
quality of TB care. These study results, complemented with the 4-city analysis on pharmacist
behaviors, provides new multicity, qualification-specific information for TB control in India.
It remains to be seen the extent to which private-sector engagement efforts—such as the PPIA
pilots—will make an impact on quality and be able to sustain improvements in quality of care.
Incorporating quality measures alongside program implementation is the first step, particu-
larly as aspects of the PPIA model are being scaled up in more than 40 Indian cities, supported
by the Global Fund.
We emphasize that the low observed proportions of correctly managed interactions do not
fit a hypothesis in which providers followed an alternate protocol that reflects “what is good
for the patient but not for society” (such as a wait-and-see approach for a patient with persis-
tent cough). Providers treated the SPs in idiosyncratically different ways without a consistent
protocol. Neither are the data consistent with the view that very high patient loads are respon-
sible for low quality. Of the weighted 2,602 interactions, 45% had no other patients waiting,

 65% had a queue of 1 or fewer, 75% had 2 or fewer, and 95% had 10 or fewer. This is similar to
what has been observed in previous SP studies as well as time-and-motion studies in health
clinics [33].
We consider, instead, the following 2 broad classes of explanations for this behavior:
(a) providers have a difficult time diagnosing TB appropriately, and (b) private providers devi-
ate from established standards for financial gain. There is evidence for both types of behavior,
implying that quality deficits are not driven by either knowledge gaps or financial incentives
alone. In favor of an explanation driven by poor diagnostic skills, we find that improving cer-
tainty about the diagnosis had a positive effect on quality of care (although the results are not
statistically significant in the Case 4 comparison because of the small sample size, they are
quantitatively as large as those in the Case 1 to Case 3 comparison). However, lack of diagnos-
tic certainty was not the only indicator of poor quality we observed in our study, nor did qual-
ity improve across every dimension when the test results were provided to the provider.
Increasing diagnostic certitude improved correct case management but had smaller effects on
reducing inappropriate medicine use.
This suggests that financial considerations and poor diagnostic ability may both play a role
in explaining the patterns we observe and mirror previous findings with pharmacists in 4
urban Indian locations [14,34]. Across settings, we find that these diagnostic practices are
highly predictive of whether the provider offers correct management in a given interaction,
but we cannot “force” providers to take detailed histories from their patients because a good
history and physical is an essential indicator of quality in and of itself.
Our study has several strengths and contributes to the literature in several ways. First, we
representatively sampled large numbers of private health providers in 2 Indian cities, and after
weighting to the city universe of providers, we provide precise estimates of provider behavior
at the city level. Because the analysis is representative of these 2 Indian cities, caution is war-
ranted when generalizing to a context outside of urban India. Second, by using unannounced
SPs, we captured actual provider behavior, as opposed to self-reported knowledge or practices.
Given our prior work showing a big “know-do gap” (the gap between what providers know
and what they do in actual practice) [12], the SP methodology better reflects reality for patients
than any other existing method used to measure quality of care. Third, our study included
MBBS-qualified providers, as well as AYUSH providers and those with other or no qualifica-
tions, capturing the complexity of training within the Indian private healthcare sector. Fourth,
by developing 4 different SP case presentations, we studied how providers dealt with various
stages of TB disease and varying levels of diagnostic certainty. Lastly, by assessing outcomes by
city, provider qualification, and type of case, we assessed the most important sources of varia-
tion in quality of care. While previous studies showed suboptimal quality of care, our study
was able to explore the role of provider qualifications on quality using 2 city-wide, representa-
tive samples.
Our study has limitations. First, because we do not observe how patients actually choose
providers, patient sorting by qualification, geography, personal relationships, price, reputa-
tion, or other unobserved signals of quality prevents extrapolation to the likely outcomes for
actual patients with TB. This remains an important area for future work. Second, our cases
are designed as one-time interactions, and the SP data do not reflect follow-up visit path-
ways, which have been shown by other studies to be long and convoluted and had various
forms in our data (S2 Fig). For instance, we cannot say, from this study, what the doctor
would do after the patient has returned after completing a CXR as ordered. To the extent
that doctor behavior is different when the patient comes with a CXR that the doctor herself
recommended (rather than with a CXR ordered by another doctor), our approximations of
provider behavior under different scenarios may be erroneous. The ability for the SP method

 to measure quality of care measures in follow-up visits with the same SP individual in similar
settings has not been published to our knowledge, and—given the frequency of providers
asking for patients to return exhibited in this study—it could be worthwhile to explore the
potential for the method to assess whether the likelihood of receiving better care increases
when a patient returns. With this, it would be important to understand the extent to which
real patients return upon a provider’s request, as well as the necessary work needed so that
SPs are not detected.
While not a limitation per se, we also highlight that our definition of correct case manage-
ment follows national and international TB standards of care. We have chosen to use these def-
initions because they allow for comparability across studies and disciplines our analyses of the
data using a clearly prespecified protocol. But our data could also raise questions about the via-
bility and validity of these standards. For instance, it is reasonable to ask whether—in cities
with air pollution, which can cause respiratory symptoms—healthcare providers should be
asked to send a patient with a 3-week cough for a sputum test rather than giving them symp-
tomatic therapy and asking them to follow up as required.
Our data are not consistent with the idea that providers were following a single alternate
protocol because virtually every combination of drug classes was used for the SP cases. Never-
theless, there could be justifiable reasons why providers still choose to deviate from estab-
lished standards of care. One way, then, to interpret our findings and our use of the term
“correct case management” is as an ordinal ranking rather than adherence to a standard: pro-
viders who follow the standards are of higher quality, but this does not imply that those who
do not follow the standards necessarily provide “incorrect” care. Instead of imposing alter-
nate standards, we have chosen to present the full set of management practices for each SP
case to allow readers to make their own more nuanced judgments. We have also made the
data publicly available so that researchers can simulate correct management under alternate
standards, in turn stimulating debate around whether these standards themselves require fur-
ther revision.
Despite the limitations, our large-scale, 2-city quality of care study provides accurate and
representative estimates of provider behavior that may inform not only quality-improvement
efforts in health but also interventions to improve TB care and reduce transmission in the
community.
