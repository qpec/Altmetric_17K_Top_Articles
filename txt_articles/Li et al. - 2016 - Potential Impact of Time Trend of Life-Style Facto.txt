Abstract
BACKGROUND—Cardiovascular disease (CVD) is a leading cause of death in China. 
Evaluation of risk factors and their impacts on disease burden is important for future public health 
initiatives and policy making.
OBJECTIVE—We used data from a cohort of the China Health and Nutrition Survey to estimate 
time trends in cardiovascular risk factors from 1991 through 2011.
METHODS—We applied the Comparative Risk Assessment method to estimate the number of 
CVD events attributable to all non-optimal levels (e.g., theoretical-minimum-risk exposure 
distribution, TMRED) of each risk factor.
RESULTS—In 2011, high blood pressure, high low-density lipoprotein cholesterol, and high 
blood glucose were associated with 3.1, 1.4, and 0.9 million CVD events in China, respectively. 
Increase in body mass index (BMI) was associated with an increase in attributable CVD events,

 from 0.5 million to 1.1 million between 1991 and 2011, while decreased physical activity was 
associated with a 0.7-million increase in attributable CVD events. In 2011, 53.4% of males used 
tobacco, estimated to be responsible for 30.1% of CVD burden in males. Dietary quality 
improved, but remained suboptimal; mean intakes were 5.4 (TMRED: 2.0) g/day for sodium, 67.7 
(TMRED: 300.0) g/day for fruits, 6.2 (TMRED: 114.0) g/day for nuts, and 25.0 (TMRED: 250.0) 
mg/day for marine omega-3 fatty acids in 2011.
CONCLUSION—High blood pressure remains the most important individual risk factor related 
to CVD burden in China. Increased BMI and decreased physical activity were also associated with 
the increase in CVD burden from 1991 to 2011. High rates of tobacco use in males and unhealthy 
dietary factors continue to contribute to the burden of CVD in China.

INTRODUCTION
In the past 2 decades, China experienced a dramatic shift in diet from traditional to Western 
dietary patterns (1). Decreased consumption of coarse grains and legumes were countered by 
increased intake of animal-source food and cooking oil (2). Rapid urbanization and 
industrialization led to a steep decline in physical activity levels (3). These changes have 
been accompanied by marked increases in serum cholesterol levels (4,5), obesity (6,7), and 
type 2 diabetes (8,9). Smoking prevalence in China remains high (10). Overall, CVD has 
surpassed infectious diseases to become the leading cause of death in China (11). Therefore, 
it is imperative to study the trends in CVD risk factors and their relationship to disease 
burden, in order to evaluate current public health policies and provide guidance for future 
disease prevention and health promotion.
In this study, we describe time trends in dietary and other lifestyle risk factors for CVD from 
1991 to 2011 using data from an ongoing open cohort of the China Health and Nutrition 
Survey (CHNS) (12). We then apply the Comparative Risk Assessment (CRA) method (13) 
to estimate the number of CVD events attributable to non-optimal levels of these risk factors.
METHODS
STUDY POPULATION
The CHNS (12) is an ongoing prospective household-based study of multiple age groups 
across 9 rounds of data collection, including 4,400 households with a total of 26,000 
individuals in nine provinces. CHNS was initiated in 1989 and conducted follow-up visits in 
1991, 1993, 1997, 2000, 2004, 2006, 2009, and 2011. Data are publicly available for 
download at http://www.cpc.unc.edu/projects/china.
A stratified probability sampling method was applied to the study population, as described in 
detail previously (12). Briefly, the CNHS used a multistage, random cluster design in 9 
provinces (Liaoning, Jiangsu, Shandong, Henan, Hubei, Hunan, Guangxi, Guizhou, and 
Heilongjiang). Within each province, 2 cities (1 large and 1 small, usually the provincial

 capital and a lower-income city) and 4 counties (stratified by income, 1 high-, 1 low- and 2 
middle-income) were selected. Within cities, 2 urban and 2 suburban communities were 
randomly selected. Within counties, 1 community in the capital city and 3 rural villages 
were randomly chosen. Twenty households per community were then selected for 
participation. We excluded data from the 1989 wave because it enrolled only adults aged 20–
45 years. We also excluded the data for 3 megacities from the comparison of time trend, as 
those data were available only in 2011. Additionally, we excluded participants who were 
pregnant or under 35 years old at the time of the survey.
COMPARATIVE RISK ASSESSMENT METHOD
We applied population-level CRA to calculate the population attributable risk (13), i.e. the 
proportion of CVD burden that would have been prevented if the distribution of specific risk 
factor exposure had been changed to a hypothetical alternative distribution while holding 
other risk factors constant. We conducted all analyses separately (20 groups in total): by sex, 
community-level urbanization as classified by the Chinese government (urban or rural), and 
age group based on age at measurement (35–44, 45–54, 55–64, 65–74, and ≥ 75 years). We 
restricted analyses to participants ≥ 35 years of age because of limited data on the effects of 
these risk factors and fewer CVD events among younger participants.
For the CRA analysis, we included data from different sources, including 1) the current 
distribution of risk factor exposure in each wave; 2) the etiological effects of risk factor 
exposures on coronary heart disease (CHD), ischemic stroke, and hemorrhagic stroke, 
respectively; 3) an alternative theoretical-minimum-risk exposure distribution (TMRED); 
and 4) the total number of CVD events in the population.
RISK FACTOR SELECTION
We selected 17 dietary and lifestyle risk factors for which 1) there was sufficient evidence 
for the presence and magnitude of probable causal relationships with coronary heart disease 
(CHD), ischemic stroke, and hemorrhagic stroke, 2) there were available intervention 
strategies to modify exposure of risk, and 3) data on risk factor exposure were available in 
CHNS without systematic bias. Factors included high systolic blood pressure (SBP), high 
low density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol, high blood glucose, high body mass index (BMI), 
low physical inactivity, current tobacco smoking, and 11 dietary risk factors. Table 1 
summarizes these 17 risk factors, their optimal level (TMRED), CVD outcomes, and sources 
of the relative risk (RR) used for estimating CVD burden. As the blood samples for LDL and 
glucose were collected only once in CHNS, we included all 17 risk factors for CVD burden 
in 2011 but only 15 factors for time trend analysis.
MEASUREMENTS
Sex, age, primary occupation category, highest educational level achieved, and smoking 
status were self-reported in each wave. Dietary information was collected by 3-day 24-hour 
dietary recalls in addition to using the 3-day food-weighted method to assess cooking oil and 
condiment consumption. Nutrient intakes were calculated using the China Food 
Composition Tables (FCT). Specifically, FCT-1991 (14) was used for dietary data from the 
1997 and 2000 waves; FCT-2002/2004 (15,16) was used for dietary data from the 2004,

 2006, 2009, and 2011 waves. We did not include the dietary data from 1991 or 1993 because 
the food codes in those datasets did not match the food codes in FCT (matching codes were 
not released). We evaluated energy-adjusted dietary intakes for each dietary factor, except 
for polyunsaturated fat (PUFA), using the residual method to 2000 kcal/day (17). PUFA 
intake was calculated as the percentage of total energy intake.
Following standardized procedures, trained health workers measured the weight and height 
of all participants using calibrated equipment (SECA 880 scales and SECA 206 wall-
mounted metal tapes) (18), and BMI was calculated as weight (kg) divided by height 
squared (m2).
Each participant’s seated systolic blood pressure (SBP) was measured on the right arm using 
standard mercury sphygmomanometers by experienced physicians who attended a 7-day 
data-collection training session and passed a comprehensive reliability test (19). Three 
measurements were obtained with a 30-second interval between cuff inflations if the first 
measure was normal. Otherwise, participants were requested to rest for 10–30 min before a 
second measurement was taken (19). The mean value of 3 measurements was used.
LABORATORY ANALYSIS
Analysis methods for blood glucose and LDL cholesterol are described in detail elsewhere 
(1). In brief, overnight-fasting blood glucose and LDL cholesterol were measured with the 
GOD-PAP method and the polyethylene glycol (PEG)-modified enzyme method, 
respectively.
Participants self-reported physical activity on a questionnaire that solicited detailed 
information on occupational and domestic activities (3). Total metabolic equivalent of task 
(MET) hours per week was calculated by multiplying the METs values (20) of activities by 
the time spent on the activity. We also categorized study participants into different physical 
activity levels according to their MET-minutes per week (0: < 600; 1: 600–3999; 2: 4000–
7999; 3: ≥ 8000 MET-minutes) (21).
ETIOLOGICAL EFFECTS OF RISK FACTORS ON CVD
Data on etiological effects of risk factor exposures on CVD were extracted from the most 
recent systematic reviews and meta-analyses (13,22–35). For each risk factor-CVD 
association, we derived the same RR for males and females, except where empirical 
evidence indicated that the RR differed by sex (13,24). We used consistent age-varying 
distributions of RRs for CVD across risk factors, because the associations vary by age. 
Current evidence suggests that the effects of these risk factors on CVD in Western and Asian 
populations are similar (36–38), we extracted RRs from published studies regardless of the 
ethnicity of study populations.
OPTIMAL EXPOSURE DISTRIBUTION
We used TMRED as the alternative optimal exposure distribution to assess the proportion of 
CVD events associated with all non-optimal levels of exposure (13). The TMRED for 
smoking was zero (e.g., no tobacco smoking). For variables where the exposure of zero is

 physiologically impossible, such as BMI, SBP, glucose, LDL, diet, and physical activity, the 
levels corresponding to the lowest CVD risk in epidemiological studies or the levels 
observed in low-exposure populations were used as TMREDs (Table 1).
TOTAL CVD MORBIDITY AND MORTALITY
CVD morbidity and mortality in China were extracted from the China Health Statistical 
Yearbook and the National Population Census. We extracted data on age-, sex-, and urban/
rural-specific mortality rate of 2011 for CHD and stroke from the China Health Statistical 
Yearbook. The mortality rate was combined with the age-, sex-, and urban/rural-specific 
population data from the 2010 Population Census of the People’s Republic of China to 
obtain CHD and stroke mortality events for each category. We applied the age- and sex-
specific ratio of ischemic to hemorrhagic stroke (39) to classify total stroke deaths 
attributable to each type of stroke. The age- and sex-specific case-fatality (39) and mortality 
events attributable to CHD, ischemic, and hemorrhagic stroke deaths were calibrated to 
reproduce the total morbidity and mortality events for total CVD.
STATISTICAL ANALYSIS
Mean (standard deviation) or percentage of each risk factor was presented by sex, age group, 
and urban/rural area in each wave. We applied the multivariate-adjusted general linear 
mixed-regression model, which allowed us to account for repeated measurements collected 
on the same individual over time using a random intercept for subject, to calculate covariate-
adjusted mean levels of risk factors for subgroups by sex, age, and urban/rural area in each 
wave. To quantify time trends of the risk factors, the regression models included the year of 
each wave as a scored trend variable. The difference in time trend of each factor between 
subgroups was tested by including the interactions between subgroup variables and temporal 
trend in risk factor in the models: linear regression models for continuous variables and 
logistic regression model for smoking.
STANDARDIZATION
To describe the overall trends for each factor over time, we estimated the distributions of the 
risk factor in the joint classifications of sex, age group, and urban/rural area (20 groups in 
total) in each wave, then calculated the sex, age, and urban/rural standardized overall 
distribution of each risk factor using the 2010 Chinese Population Census data as the 
standard.
Projection—Future trends of 15 risk factors (except LDL and glucose, for which we do not 
have repeated measurements) for 2012–2031 were projected based on data for participants 
with > 3 repeated measurements during 1991–2011. We used a random effects model within 
each stratum of age, sex, and urban/rural. We also applied a time-series analysis with 
Bayesian panel Value-at-Risk (VAR) model (40,41) to project future values for 2012–2031 
based on the average secular trend of each risk factor from 1991 (for diet from 1997 and for 
physical activity from 2004 [42]) to 2011.
Estimating CVD Attributable to Specific Risk Factors—Assuming a causal 
relationship between each risk factor and CVD, we calculated the population-attributable

 fraction (PAF) (13) to estimate the proportional reduction in CVD events that would occur if 
risk factor exposure had been reduced to an alternative level based on the total effects of the 
risk factor.
For risk factors measured continuously (blood pressure, LDL, glucose, BMI, and dietary 
factors besides marine omega-3 fatty acids), we computed PAFs using the following 
equation (where x = exposure level, P(x) = actual distribution of exposure in the population, 
P′(x) = alternative distribution of exposure in the population, RR(x) = RR of CVD at 
exposure level x, and m = maximum exposure level):
The discrete version of the same estimator for PAF was applied to risks measured in 
categories of exposure (smoking, physical inactivity, and marine omega-3 fatty acids). The 
PAF related to each risk factor for each outcome (CHD, ischemic, and hemorrhagic stroke) 
was calculated by joint classifications of sex, age groups, and urban/rural area (20 groups in 
total). We calculated the number of CHD, ischemic stroke, and hemorrhagic stroke events 
attributable to each risk factor by multiplying its PAF by total events. The number of total 
CVD events was the sum of the numbers of CHD, ischemic stroke, and hemorrhagic stroke 
events. The PAF% for total CVD due to each risk factor was estimated by dividing the sum 
of events attributable to CHD, ischemic, and hemorrhagic stroke by the total number of 
CVD events in the population. As the CVD events attributable to individual risk factors 
often overlap, the total CVD events attributable to all risk factors could not simply be 
summed.
RESULTS
TIME TRENDS OF RISK FACTORS
Based on repeated measurements of the CHNS, we observed that mean SBP significantly 
increased over time in the whole population (Table 2), with more pronounced trends in the 
younger population and rural residents (both Ps for interaction < 0.0001). SBP increased by 
2.0 mmHg (95% Confidence Interval [CI] 1.2–2.9) among urban residents and 6.7 mmHg 
(95%CI 6.1–7.2) among rural residents over the 20 years. We found a similar increasing 
trend in BMI over time; younger and rural residents showed greater increases (Table 2). 
Smoking was 1 of the leading lifestyle risk factors for CVD, especially among males. 
Despite a declining trend in smoking over time, 53.4% of males were still tobacco users in 
2011 (Table 2). The average physical activity level decreased from 1991 to 2011 overall 
(Table 2).
We classified dietary factors into 2 groups: moderation components (lower intake is 
preferred), including sodium, red meat, processed meat, and sugar-sweetened beverages 
(SSBs); and adequacy components (higher intake is preferred), including dietary fiber, fruits, 
vegetables, nuts, whole grains, PUFA, and marine omega-3 fatty acids.

 We observed a decreasing trend in sodium intake overall, although subgroup rates differed 
(Ps for interaction > 0.1 for all, Table 2). Consumptions of SSBs, red meat, and processed 
meat increasedover time, but overall consumption remained relatively low. Intakes of dietary 
fiber, fruit, nuts, vegetables, and marine omega-3 fatty acids increased significantly over 
time among all groups (Table 2), but average intake remained below the TMRED levels.
DISEASE BURDEN OF CVD IN 2011
In 2011, 6.79 million Chinese residents aged 35 years or older died—3.04 million of 
cardiovascular diseases. The estimated number of CVD events was 6.97 million (CHD 2.96, 
ischemic stroke 2.43, hemorrhagic stroke 1.58 million) in 2011.
We estimated that high blood pressure, the leading individual attributable factor for CVD 
events in China, was associated with 3.1 million CVD events in 2011 (Figure 1). The 
estimated PAF of high blood pressure was 43.8% for overall CVD in 2011 (Online Table 1).
In 2011, high LDL cholesterol and high blood glucose associated with 1.4 and 0.9 million 
CVD events, respectively (Figure 1). High LDL cholesterol was the second leading risk 
factor for CHD, with an estimated PAF of 37.2% in 2011. High LDL cholesterol was 
associated with 10.8% of ischemic stroke burden. The PAF of high blood glucose was 15.1% 
for CHD, 10.9% for ischemic stroke, 10.7% for hemorrhagic stroke, and 12.6% for overall 
CVD.
In 2011, current smoking was estimated to be associated with 1.3 million CVD events with a 
PAF of 30.1% among males and 7.5% of females (Online Table 1). Because harmful effects 
of smoking persist after smoking cessation (13), we estimated another 0.28 million CVD 
cases would be related to former smoking in 2011 (Online Table 2). The PAF for CVD of 
former and current smoking together was 36.0% among males and 9.1% of females in 2011.
High sodium intake was the leading dietary factor for CVD through its effect on increasing 
blood pressure. In 2011, high sodium intake was associated with 1.6 million CVD events 
(PAF 23.5%), overlapping at least partially with the total CVD burden associated with SBP 
(Figure 1).
Physical inactivity was the third leading risk factor for CHD, and estimated to be associated 
with 0.9 million CHD events (PAF 30.8%) in 2011, followed by insufficient marine omega-3 
fatty acid intake (0.8 million CHD events with PAF of 26.6%) (Figure 1). Low consumption 
of nuts was associated with a PAF of 10.0% for CHD, while low fruit consumption was 
associated with PAF of 19.6% for ischemic stroke and 19.3% for hemorrhagic stroke (Figure 
1).
TIME TRENDS OF ESTIMATED CVD BURDEN
A trend for increasing SBP yielded an estimated 45,264 more CVD events from 1991 to 
2011, and there will be a further increase of 393,470 CVD events during 2011–2031 
(Central Illustration-1). The number of CVD events attributable to high BMI was very low in 
1991, but increases in BMI were associated with 584,218 CVD additional events during the 
following 20 years and could potentially contribute to another 310,288 CVD events from 
Li et al.

 2011 to 2031 (Central Illustration-2). A declining trend in current smoking was estimated to 
be associated with 190,826 fewer CVD cases during 1991–2011 and is projected to be 
associated with 81,329 fewer CVD cases during 2011–2031(Central Illustration-3). In 2011, 
the average physical activity level was only 192 METs-hour/week (Standard error [SE] 7.9, 
Central Illustration-4). A decline in physical activity was estimated to relate to 748,019 
CVD events during 1991–2011, and it will associate with a further increase of 325,448 CVD 
events during 2011–2031.
The overall sodium intake decreased but remained high when compared with the TMRED 
level in 2011 (g/day, mean: 5.4; SE 0.2; TMRED 2.0). The decreasing trend in sodium 
intake may result in a large reduction in CVD burden if optimal reduction in blood pressure 
related to sodium intake is achieved (Figure 2-1). However, we might have under-estimated 
the sodium intake by using data collected by a food-weighted method that weighted the 
foods, salt and other condiments consumption at home. As shown in Online Figure 1, the 
energy contributions from snacks, from foods prepared and/or eaten out of home increased 
over time. Including salt and condiments intake from foods prepared away from home, the 
average sodium intake was 6.75g in 2011 (Online Table 2). The CVD burden associated with 
high sodium intake would be 2.3 million after this adjustment.
In 2011, the average intake of SSBs, red meat, and processed meat was 3.5g/day (SE 2.4), 
79.7g/day (SE 3.4), and 4.0g/day (SE 0.8), respectively (Figure 2). The mean intakes were 
10.8 (TMRED 30.0) g/day for fiber, 67.7 (TMRED 300.0) g/day for fruits, 6.2 (TMRED 
114.0) g/day for nuts, and 25.0 (TMRED 250.0) mg/day for marine omega-3 fatty acids in 
2011 (Figure 3). Insufficient intakes of marine omega-3 fatty acids, fruits, and fiber were 
estimated to be associated with 1.3 million, 1.0 million, and 0.6 million CVD events, 
respectively in 2011. Increasing intake of marine omega-3 fatty acids over time did not 
produce a large decline in CVD burden, but consumption was still far below optimal levels 
(Figure 3).
DISCUSSION
To our knowledge, this is the first population-based study of CVD burden in China that 
examines a wide range of dietary, lifestyle, and metabolic risk factors among a large and 
representative Chinese population. We found that multiple modifiable risk factors, including 
high blood pressure, high LDL cholesterol, high blood glucose, high BMI, smoking, 
physical inactivity, and a diet low in fruits and marine omega-3 fatty acids but high in 
sodium accounted for a large number of CVD events in China. We observed modest 
improvements in tobacco control and multiple dietary intake components, which may have 
slowed the rapid increase in the burden of CVD. Nevertheless, the smoking rate and dietary 
quality still fell short of optimal goals, and these modest improvements could not counteract 
the increasing burden of CVD due to unfavourable concurrent changes in BMI and physical 
activity levels.
The increasing upward trend in SBP was consistent with Chinese national surveillance data 
showing a continuous increase in the prevalence of hypertension over the past half century: 
The prevalence of high blood pressure was 5.1% in 1959 (43), 7.7% in 1979, 13.6% in 1991

 (44), 17.7% in 2002 (45), and 33.5% in 2010 (46). The most recent prevalence figures on 
high blood pressure are comparable to those among U.S. adults (47). The estimated PAF of 
43.8% of high blood pressure implied that about 2 in 5 CVD events in China might be 
prevented if SBP could be managed to the theoretical minimum level of 115mmHg. 
Although sodium-attributable CVD burden was assumed to be mediated through elevated 
blood pressure, we did not find a parallel between decreased sodium intake and decreased 
blood pressure (30). One explanation is that the potential decrease in blood pressure 
attributable to sodium reduction may have been counterbalanced by an increase in blood 
pressure from higher BMI (48) and lower physical activity levels (49). Our estimation of 
blood pressure-attributable CVD burden was close to global estimates; high blood pressure 
was estimated to be responsible for 45–48% of deaths from ischemic heart disease and 47–
53% of deaths from stroke in 2010 (50).
Increased BMI and decreased physical activity contributed significantly to the increase in 
CVD burden from 1991 to 2011 (51). China now has more obese individuals than the US. 
The worldwide ranking of the number of severely obese individuals has moved China from 
60th place for males and 41st place for females in 1975 to 2nd for both males and females in 
2014 (51). Our estimated CVD burden attributable to high BMI is probably conservative; 
etiological effect of BMI was derived mostly from Caucasian populations, and Chinese tend 
to have higher CVD risk at lower BMI levels than Caucasians (52,53). Meanwhile, Chinese 
has become more sedentary (3). Bicycle ownership decreased from 150–300 bicycles per 
100 families in 1990s to only 77 bicycles per 100 households in 2011. Around 61% of rural 
households owned a motorcycle, and 19% of urban households owned a car in 2011 (54). At 
the same time, TV ownership increased from 38 sets per 1000 persons in 1985 to 112–135 
sets per 100 households in 2011 (54). Future unfavourable trends in BMI and physical 
activity level will exacerbate the increase in CVD burden, especially in combination with the 
increasing consumption of SSBs, red meat, and processed meat. Compared to other 
countries such as Germany, Finland, South Korea, and India, China has experienced a more 
dramatic shift in dietary patterns, from a traditional diet high in plant-based foods to a 
Westernized, animal-based diet (55). Reduced rates of smoking and increased consumption 
of dietary fiber, fruit, nuts, and marine omega-3 fatty acids may have mitigated the increase 
in CVD, but current smoking rates are still high, and dietary quality is far short of optimal 
goals. Further improvement would reduce the CVD burden and disease burden from other 
causes (56).
High blood LDL cholesterol was the second leading risk factor for CHD. The rapid 
transition to a Western dietary pattern has led to rapid increase in serum cholesterol levels 
(4). In 1982–1984, the prevalence of borderline high or high total cholesterol was 17.6% in 
males and 19.2% in females, which increased to 24% in males and 27.1% in females in 
1992–1994 (57). The prevalence increased to 31.3% in males and 31.7% in females in 2007–
2008 (5). Type 2 diabetes is a growing epidemic in China, occurring at a relatively young 
age and low BMI (58). Type 2 diabetes was rare in China in the 1980s, with an estimated 
prevalence of 0.67% (41). In subsequent national surveys conducted in 1994 (59), 2000–
2001 (60), 2007–2008 (9), and 2010–2011 (8), the prevalence of diabetes was 2.5%, 5.5%, 
9.7%, and 11.6%, respectively. Those data imply that CVD events associated with high LDL 
and glucose will continue to increase in the future.

 Our study has a number of strengths. First, it was the first population-level analysis of the 
CVD burden in China that included a multitude of dietary and lifestyle factors using 
comparable methods to examine potentially preventable risk factors for CVD. To our 
knowledge, only 1 previous study has estimated future CVD burden in China, but it 
considered only 5 factors (blood pressure, LDL, glucose, BMI, and smoking), without 
considering any dietary factors (39). Other disease-burden studies in China have focused 
mainly on mortality or quality of life (61). Second, our estimate of each RR was based on 
the most recent and best available evidence on risk-exposure distribution in the population. 
Third, the exposure distribution of all risk factors was estimated based on original data from 
the CHNS. Previous disease-burden projects were based on pooling exposure distributions 
from different studies. The original data based estimation allowed us to account for potential 
residual confounding, although it could not be completely eliminated. Other strengths 
included the originality and high response rate of the CHNS as this survey was the only 
large-scale longitudinal study of its kind in China. Overall response rates of CHNS were 
around 88% at the individual level and 90% at the household level (62).
Our study also has limitations. CVD is likely caused by multiple factors acting 
simultaneously, CVD events attributable to individual risk factors often overlap, and the total 
CVD events attributable to all risk factors cannot not simply be summed. In addition, some 
factors may interact. For example, physical inactivity may increase the risk of CVD through 
increasing BMI and blood pressure. The total number of CVD events attributable to multiple 
factors that may interact with each other could not be obtained by simple addition. A 
potential solution is to use the joint exposure distributions of all correlated risk factors 
together combined with their related RRs with CVD risk to estimate the overall CVD 
burden. However, no solidly evidence-based RRs are presently available for joint 
classification, including all dietary and lifestyle risk factors. We did not consider aging or 
population growth in our time-trend analysis of CVD burden. We applied CVD events in 
2011 to all PAFs in different waves to estimate the time trend of attributable CVD burden. 
This may have over-estimated the CVD burden before 2001 but under-estimated future CVD 
burden, since the Chinese population is aging. As reported in 1 previous estimate (39), CVD 
events will probably increase by 50% from 2011 to 2031 due to aging and population growth 
alone, even if all risk factors remain at year-2011 levels. Our projection of CVD burden 
associated with individual risk factors might be an underestimation, as our standardization 
and estimates were based on the population proportion and number of CVD events in 2011.
Our estimates of the preventable CVD burden is important for public health and policy 
makers in China. Previous studies demonstrate the efficacy and effectiveness of preventable 
strategies in reducing the levels of CVD risk factors and total CVD burden in high-risk 
individuals and general population (1). The Chinese Dietary Guideline, with its visual 
version, Chinese Food Pagoda, had been developed to promoted dietary advice to the public 
for many years (63,64). Most of the recommendation levels of the Chinese Dietary 
Guidelines are in line with the TMREDs in this analysis, such as recommendations on 
vegetables (400 g/day) and fruit (300 g/day) (63,64). We used a TMRED level of 2 g/day for 
sodium, which is slightly lower than the recommended level (2.4g/day sodium [6 g/day salt]) 
in the Chinese Dietary guidelines. We intented our analysis to contribute to the scientific 
evidence base for population-level CVD prevention strategies; recommendations on salt

 intake in the Chinese Dietary Guidelines considered both scientific evidence and practical 
health promotion in Chinese who had a very high usual intake level of sodium (19). Health 
education and lifestyle intervention programs are effective in prevention of diabetes and 
CVD in China (1). Effective screening strategies are needed, as less than one-third of 
hypertension and diabetes patients were aware their conditions. Although promotion of 
smoking cessation, national bans on smoking in public and work places, and bans on 
tobacco advertising have halted the in smoking prevalence (65), the percentage of male 
smokers is still high in China; targeted interventions are still warranted. Besides managing 
preventable risk factors, other strategies should also be helpful for CVD control include 
promoting health insurance coverage, eradicating of poverty, developing environments 
conductive to walking and bicycling, and controlling air pollution. Prevention should be a 
top national policy priority for CVD control (1), which depends on fully involved 
stakeholders from government, health care, education, industry, urban planning, the media, 
the food production and service sectors, non-governmental organizations, communities, and 
individuals (1).
In conclusion, high blood pressure remains the leading factor contributing to the increasing 
CVD burden in China, though increasing BMI and decreasing physical activity were also 
important. Decreased smoking prevalence and sodium consumption, and increased fruit, 
fiber, and seafood intakes contributed to slight reductions in CVD burden; however, the 
current levels of these factors remain below optimal levels. With rapid westernization of the 
Chinese diet, consumption of red meat, processed meat, and SSBs should be targets for 
future interventions to prevent CVD in China.

 PERSPECTIVES
COMPETENCY IN SYSTEMS-BASED PRACTICE
High blood pressure is the most prevalent cardiovascular risk factor in China, but elevated 
body mass index and physical inactivity also contributed to increases in cardiovascular 
disease burden from 1991 to 2011. High rates of tobacco use in males and unhealthy 
dietary habits are ongoing threats to the health of the population.
TRANSLATIONAL OUTLOOK
More work is needed to develop and implement prevention strategies directed at 
modifiable risk factors, at both the individual and population level, to reduce the 
mounting burden of cardiovascular disease in China.

 Central Illustration. Preventable CVD Burden in China: Time trend and Estimated 
Cardiovascular Disease (CVD) Events
Attributable to high systolic blood pressure (1), high body mass index (2), smoking (3) and 
lower physical activity (4). Cardiovascular diseases (CVD) events, represented as solid bars, 
refer to the combined burden from coronary heart diseases, ischemic stroke and hemorrhagic 
stroke; Circles represent Means and I bars represent Standard Errors (SE) of each risk 
factor distribution at each time point, which were standardized by age, sex, and urban/rural 
distribution using the 2010 Chinese Population Census data as the standard; Reference line 
represents the level of CVD events associated with each risk factor at 1991 for a visual 
comparison of CVD burden changes with time from the baseline.

*We applied the multivariate-adjusted general linear mixed regression model to calculate covariate-adjusted mean levels with adjustment for age, sex, urban/rural area, educational level, occupation, and 
provinces besides the subgroup variable; To quantify time trends of the risk factors, the regression models included the year of each wave as a scored trend variable;
**A strict Bonferroni correction was applied to adjust for multiple comparisons; a P value < 0.001 was considered;
