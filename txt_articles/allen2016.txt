ABSTRACT 
Background: The prostate undergoes gradually growth throughout men’s lives, resulting 
development of lower urinary tract symptoms due to benign prostatic hyperplasia 
(LUTS/BPH). The aim of this review was to determine whether Thermobalancing could be 
used for conservative treatment of LUTS/BPH.  
Methods and Results: Men older than 55 with LUTS derived to BPH used Thermobalancing 
therapy enabled by therapeutic device as mono therapy. The main group consisted of 124 
patients with the prostate volume (PV) up to 60 ml, however, there were also men with the 
prostate volume (PV) over 60 ml that were studied separately. Before and after 6 months 
Thermobalancing the International Prostate Symptom Score (IPSS) lessened (P <0.001), 
quality of life  (QoL) index improved, ultrasound PV reduced (P <0.001) and uroflowmetry 
maximum flow rate (Qmax) increased (P <0.001). The dynamics of the same measurements in 
the watchful waiting or active surveillance control-group have shown negative outcomes. 
Discussion and Conclusions: The observed positive effect of therapeutic device for BPH has 
allowed us to recommend this side-effect free therapy in watchful waiting or active 
surveillance approach. Therefore, Thermobalancing can be used as safe physiotherapeutic 
solution for men with enlarged prostate in order to reduce LUTS.

BACKGROUND 
Patients with mild symptoms or moderate-to-severe symptoms of benign prostatic 
hyperplasia (BPH) who are not bothered by their symptoms and are not experiencing 
complications of BPH should be managed with a strategy of watchful waiting (1). According 
to The European Association of Urology (EAU) Guidelines on Conservative Treatment in 
2010: Conservative treatment of male LUTS should include self-management, however 
nobody is quite sure which key components of self-management are effective, but most 
experts believe the key components are: education about the patient’s condition; reassurance 
that cancer is not a cause of the urinary symptoms; framework of periodic monitoring (2). The 
latest EAU Guidelines (2015) revealed that now exists evidence that self-management as part 
of watchful waiting reduces both symptoms and progression. Men randomised to three self-
management sessions in addition to standard care had better symptom improvement and 
quality of life (QoL) than men treated with standard care only for up to a year (3). 
The importance of self-management and conservative approach in men with BPH increased 
after researches had found the link between BPH and metabolic syndrome. The eight studies 
enrolled 5403 patients, of which 1426 (26.4%) had metabolic syndrome (MetS) defined 
according to current classification have shown that patients had significantly higher total 
prostate volume when compared with those without MetS. These studies verify the 
exacerbating role of MetS-induced metabolic derangements in the development of BPE (4). 
Investigating of uncomplicated lower urinary tract symptoms (LUTS) in men who used a 
self-management programme in addition to standard care or standard care alone demonstrated 
that behavioural treatment reduced nightly nocturia by a mean of 0.97 episodes and was 
significantly more effective than drug therapy (5). However, all attention in alternative 
approach for BPH was usually associated with the phytotherapeutic agents, as natural 
products, containing inherently vast structural diversity than synthetic compounds, have been 
the major resources for discovering new drugs (6). 
For the purpose of a targeted conservative treatment for men with BPH Dr Allen suggested 
Thermobalancing therapy enabled by topically applied therapeutic device to the projection of 
prostate (7). This device contains a natural thermoelement which accumulates body heat 
becoming a source of the energy itself. A 2-year study with this therapeutic device has shown 
decrease in urinary symptoms and prostate volume (PV). The uroflowmetry maximum flow 
rate (Qmax) increased and quality of life (OoL) improved (8,9). In this clinical review we 
display the dynamics of the symptoms and parameters in men with BPH/LUTS after 
Thermobalancing therapy and debate the possible use of therapeutic device as the 
conservative treatment option in men with prostate enlargement.

These cases show that the age of all men with BPH and PV > 60 ml, was over 70. 
Therapeutic device used as a long-term mono-therapy that decreased PV and increased Qmax, 
consequently was observed improvement in IPSS and QoL. Despite the fact that the PV 
decreased significantly in all cases, the size of the prostate remained large. This means that 
these patients should use the device longer.  
 
Safety and Costs 
There were no side effects found during the clinical trial. Besides all of this, the important 
factor is the cost of therapeutic device compared to the cost of the standard treatment options.

score by IPSS, reduced PV, increased Qmax and improved QoL. The condition of men with 
BPH and PV > 60 ml also improved significantly. At the same time in the no treatment group 
the clinical symptoms and parameters worsened. These encouraging outcomes indicate that 
thermobalancing therapy can be effective for men with BPH, particularly for the treatment 
moderate-to-severe symptoms of BPH.  
The observational clinical controlled study was used in this trial for men with BPH. The 
study was not randomised that may limit belief in the results. Of course having "placebo" or 
"sham" group as controls could provide more confidence in the outcomes. However, the 
health-related quality of life of BPH patients is considered as poor, and their psychological 
well-being is severely affected. For instance, postvoid residual urine, lower urinary tract 
symptoms, anxiety and depression are identified to be significant predictive factors of the 
health-related quality of life of patients with enlarged prostate (10). Thus, we suggested that 
men with enlarged prostate may not wear during 6 months something on the body that is 
helpless. In our opinion as patients with BPH felt healthier within weeks they used the device 
as was required. 
BPH is historically believed to be a consequence of the aging process and the treatment of the 
destructive symptoms of enlarged prostate in men should be done with the medical or 
surgical intervention. At the same time, medications used for the treatment of BPH do not 
provide sufficient performance. For example, a recent study indicated that more than half 
(52.8%) of men with BPH were dissatisfied with the results of medical treatment conducted 
according to current international guidelines for BPH (11).  
Furthermore, commonly used BPH medications have serious side effects, especially in the 
long-term use (12). Surgical treatments of prostate were found to be safe, however, advanced 
age and non-Caucasian race were independent predictors of adverse outcomes after BPH 
surgery. In patients with these attributes, conservative treatment might be a reasonable 
alternative. may harm (13). Additionally, the results of a survey of sexually active men after 
three different laser surgeries from 2005 to 2010, concluded that these surgical techniques 
can have a negative impact on sexual function, and patients with normal preoperative 
sexuality are more at risk (14).  
Although many of medical/surgical interventions were advised to men with LUTS, it was 
generally done in a non-standardized and unsystematic way. Therefore a research in this area 
described a self-management program for men with uncomplicated LUTS using formal 
methods and assessed its effectiveness in a randomized controlled trial. Self-management 
significantly reduced the frequency of escalation through the treatment cascade and reduced 
urinary symptoms (as effective as medication), suggesting that self-management could be 
considered as first-line treatment for men with LUTS (15). 
In the last decade, the opinion of the necessity of medical/surgical treatment of BPH has been 
challenged. BPH/LUTS should not be viewed as an inevitable disease of older people but part 
of the aging process which can be prevented (16). Therefore, the treatment of lower urinary 
tract symptoms in older men should be holistic, and may include conservative measures, 
lifestyle interventions and behavioral modifications as well as medication and surgery. Only 
treatments with a strong evidence base for their clinical effectiveness should be used (17).

Thermobalancing therapy can be used as preventative measure of prostate enlargement 
progression, particularly for moderate to low degree of LUTS secondary to BPH. This 
therapy is different than commonly addressed heating treatments, as the source of energy 
doesn’t exceed the normal body temperature range. Treatments with imposed heat can be 
damaging, because the high temperatures above 104 Fahrenheit (or 40°C) can destroy the 
living organism. On the other side, low temperatures decrease cellular metabolism. 
Therapeutic device applies the thermoelement tightly to the skin overcoming the skin barrier 
and spreading energy inside toward the prostate. There is no other treatment method that is 
able to overcome the skin barrier delicately and precisely. Thermobalancing therapy is the 
only external non-invasive treatment that targets the pathological point of origin continuously 
for a prolonged period of time, i.e. for days, months or even years.  
We believe that the use of therapeutic device by keeping the body temperature in the 
projection of the prostate gland acts on micro-focus of hypothermia and ischemia, removing 
the vicious cycle of spontaneous growth of capillaries in response to triggers, thereby 
relieving the BPH symptoms.  
 
CONCLUSIONS 
This review has shown that effective and safe of Thermobalancing therapy can be a useful 
solution for the conservative treatment of moderate to low degree of LUTS secondary to 
prostate enlargement. Therapeutic device should have been tried before any long-term 
pharmacotherapy is initiated.

Public Interest Statement 
 
Thermobalancing therapy and therapeutic device should have been used in men with 
moderate to low degree of lower urinary symptoms (LUTS) secondary to prostate 
enlargement before any long-term pharmacotherapy or surgical procedures are initiated. 
Many men over 50 years of age feel the need to urinate a lot, often at night, namely LUTS, 
and later it may lead to serious health problems. This happens because with ageing the 
prostate size increases squeezing the urethra and leading to benign prostatic hyperplasia 
(BPH). It is supposed that almost every man will suffer from BPH. Current treatments for 
LUTS due to BPH include medication to relax the muscles near the gland and prostate 
surgery in order to improve the flow of urine. However medical/surgical interventions have 
side effects. Therefore, positive outcomes from the study focused on Thermobalancing 
conservative prostate treatment enabled by therapeutic device show a new safe solution for 
LUTS/BPH.
