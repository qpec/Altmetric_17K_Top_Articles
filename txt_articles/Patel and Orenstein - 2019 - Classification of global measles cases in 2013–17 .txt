Classification of global measles cases in 2013–17 as due to 
policy or vaccination failure: a retrospective review of global 
surveillance data
Minal K Patel, Walter A Orenstein
Summary
Background Despite improvements in reported coverage of measles-containing vaccine (MCV) and progress towards 
elimination of measles, 172 939 measles cases were reported worldwide in 2017. Questions have been raised about 
whether measles cases are due to failure of immunisation programmes or vaccine policy failure, which might require 
changes to vaccination schedules or number of doses.
Methods This retrospective review of global surveillance data analysed case-based data for cases of measles occurring 
during 2013–17 submitted to WHO by its member states. Cases were classified as programmatically preventable 
(ie, did not receive the age-appropriate number of doses for that country) or programmatically non-preventable 
(ie, appropriately vaccinated as per national programme) on the basis of age at onset, year of birth, vaccination status, 
and eligibility for MCV doses in the country reporting the case. We grouped reasons why cases were non-preventable 
into four categories as follows: (1) received at least two doses of MCV; (2) too young for first dose; (3) received one dose 
but was too young to receive the second; or (4) was only eligible for one dose according to the national schedule. We 
analysed numbers and proportions of preventable and non-preventable cases of measles by region and year, reasons 
for non-preventable cases by year, preventable cases by age group, and preventable and non-preventable cases, 
including reasons for non-preventable cases, by measles elimination status of countries.
Findings Between Jan 1, 2013, and Dec 31, 2017, 634 139 measles cases were reported; 7850 (1%) cases were excluded 
because they did not provide age at onset, so 626 289 were included in our analysis. 191 333 (31%) of these cases had 
unknown vaccination status. 275 754 (63%) of the 434 956 cases with available vaccination data were categorised as 
programmatically preventable, 213 461 (77%) of whom were aged 1 year to less than 15 years. 156 384 (36%) cases were 
categorised as non-preventable, of whom 38 677 (25%) were two-dose vaccine recipients, 74 438 (48%) were too young 
to receive their first MCV dose, 11 914 (8%) received their first dose and were too young to receive their second dose, 
and 31 355 (20%), mostly in the Africa region, were non-preventable because they were only eligible for one dose on 
the basis of the national immunisation programme.
Interpretation Most measles cases during 2013–17 were programmatically preventable, highlighting the need for 
improving the effectiveness of immunisation programmes that already exist. Individual countries should do similar 
analyses to establish the changes needed in their country to decrease numbers of measles cases.

Introduction
All six WHO regions have committed to eliminating 
measles.1 Measles elimination requires having in place a 
robust vaccination programme where children are 
vaccinated with two doses of measles-containing vaccine 
(MCV), alongside having a strong surveillance system 
that allows a country to rapidly detect, investigate, and 
respond to every suspected case of measles.2 Substantial 
progress has been made towards elimination, with 
86 countries having interrupted or eliminated measles, 
as verified by a regional verification commission, by the 
end of 2017
.3 Globally, measles morbidity and mortality 
has fallen dramatically, although the past few years have 
seen little change in the global incidence of measles, 
which in 2017 was 25 cases per million people.1,4 With the 
stagnation in incidence and large outbreaks occurring in 
populations with reported high vaccination coverage,5,6 
questions have been asked about whether the 
recommendation of two doses of MCV is sufficient to 
eliminate measles, given that some measles cases have

occurred in people with documentation of having 
received two doses of MCV and seroprevalence is 
unexpectedly low among cohorts who had high reported 
coverage of two-dose vaccination.7–9
To answer these questions, we sought to categorise 
whether measles cases reported across WHO member 
states were due to programmatically preventable causes 
or programmatically non-preventable causes, as was 
recommended in the midterm review of the measles 
and rubella global strategic plan for 2012–20.10 Generally 
speaking, a programmatically preventable case is in 
somebody who should have been vaccinated with MCV 
according to existing recommendations, either one or 
two doses depending on the country’s recommendation, 
ideally leading to induction of an active immune 
response, but did not receive the appropriate number of 
doses. By contrast, a programmatically non-preventable 
case is either in someone who has received all recom-
mended doses of MCV but remained susceptible 
(ie, vaccine failure) or someone for whom two doses of 
measles vaccine were not recommended (eg, too young 
for two doses). All cases are preventable either directly 
by inducing active immunity or indirectly by preventing 
exposure to measles by reaching population herd 
immunity 
thresholds. 
However, 
classification 
as 
programmatically preventable or non-preventable is 
useful to establish whether changes are needed to 
improve uptake of vac 
cines among people eligible for 
vaccination (eg, directly preventing preventable cases), 
conducting catch-up campaigns among specific age 
cohorts, or if changes might be needed in vaccination 
policy (eg, changing the age of administration for the 
two recommended doses). This has been done before in 
the USA, where it was found that 66% of cases in 
1985–86 were non-preventable, because the majority of 
these cases had received the single dose of MCV 
recommended at the time; this led to the adoption of a 
two-dose MCV policy to decrease susceptibility among 
people who did not have a protective immune response 
after a single dose.11
Methods
Study design and data source
In this retrospective review of global surveillance data, 
we analysed data on measles cases across WHO member 
states to assess if measles cases were due to programme 
or policy failure. Since 2013, member states (herein 
referred to as countries) have been requested by WHO to 
submit their case-based measles surveillance data, which 
is collected by national public health programmes to 
record cases of measles and establish an appropriate 
public health response. Although surveillance methods 
vary from country to country, the basic elements are 
mostly similar. People with symptoms that suggest 
measles (eg, fever, rash and cough, conjunctivitis, and 
coryza) are reported to public health authorities. An 
investigation of the suspected case is conducted, with 
an interview about vaccination status and risk factors 
for acquisition of measles (eg, travel history and contact 
with patients with measles). Ideally, a specimen is 
collected for testing, and if the person tests positive for 
an acute measles infection, the person is classified as 
having laboratory-confirmed disease. If the person has 
had contact with other people with measles during 
their infectious period (or been in the vicinity of 
someone with measles), this person is classified as 
having epide 
miologically linked disease (if no specimen 
was collected). If a person has fever, rash and cough, 
conjunctivitis, or coryza, this person is classified as 
having clinically compatible disease. Because our study 
was an analysis of deidentified public health surveillance 
data, ethics approval was not needed. For this analysis, 
Research in context 
Evidence before this study 
The midterm review of the measles and rubella global strategic 
plan 2012–20 recommended that all measles cases be classified 
according to whether or not they were programmatically 
preventable to help understand whether the measles cases are 
due to a failure of vaccine policy or a failure to vaccinate 
appropriately according to vaccine policy. This analysis has been 
done previously in the USA, and findings led to the introduction 
of a second dose of measles vaccine. Classifying cases as 
programmatically preventable or non-preventable has never 
been done at the global level before.
Added value of this study 
We classified measles cases in 2013–17 reported to WHO as 
either programmatically preventable or non-preventable on the 
basis of age at onset, birth year, vaccination status, and 
eligibility for MCV doses. This study provides evidence that 
63% of cases are due to failure of the vaccine programme to 
appropriately vaccinate children. 
Implications of all the available evidence 
Given that most cases were programmatically preventable, 
immunisation programmes need to work harder to reach 
every child with two doses of measles-containing vaccine. 
Although 37% of case were programmatically 
non-preventable, we do not think this proportion is high 
enough to warrant a global recommendation to change 
vaccine policy at this time. However, this type of analysis 
should be done on a country-by-country basis to improve 
understanding of whether the country needs to change the 
age of vaccine dose recommendations or provide evidence to 
expedite the introduction of a second measles dose into 
routine immunisation schedules, as is already recommended 
by WHO.

people with laboratory-confirmed, epidemiologically 
linked, and clinically compatible measles with onset 
from Jan 1, 2013, to Dec 31, 2017, were analysed from 
data reported to WHO up to March 8, 2018. Cases 
without age data were excluded from the analysis.
Categorisation of cases
Each measles case was categorised as programmatically 
preventable or programmatically non-preventable on the 
basis of the age of the patient at time of onset, year 
of birth, vaccination status, and eligibility for MCV 
doses by either routine immunisation or supplemental 
immuni 
sation activities (SIAs) in the country reporting 
the case. Recommended age of first and second dose of 
MCV, as per the national 2017 schedule, and year of 
second dose of MCV introduction was obtained from 
data provided to WHO through the Joint Reporting 
Form.12,13 Historical MCV SIA data for 1987–2017 by 
country, including year of SIA and ages targeted, were 
obtained from WHO’s SIA database. In the surveillance 
data, vaccination status is self-reported, frequently 
without documented evidence. Cases with unknown 
vaccination status were kept unclassified to limit the bias 
of classifying them as receiving no vaccine doses. 
Eligibility for two doses was calculated by comparing the 
year of onset with the year of vaccine introduction for the 
second dose and the age for that recommended second 
dose, as well as factoring in whether the patient was 
eligible for another dose during a national SIA.
For this analysis, a programmatically preventable mea-
sles case was defined as a measles case in someone 
for whom MCV was indicated on the basis of the nation 
al 
immunisation 
programme 
recommendations 
(both 
routine immunisation and in national SIAs), and who did 
not receive the age-appropriate number of MCV doses. 
A programmatically non-preventable measles case was 
defined as a measles case in someone who had been 
appropriately vaccinated as per the national programme at 
the time of the patient’s birth, or for whom the vaccine was 
not routinely recommended. For this analysis, a 
programmatically non-preventable case was in someone 
who met one of four criteria: (1) received at least

two doses of MCV; (2) was too young for the first dose of 
MCV on the basis of their age at the time of onset; 
(3) received one dose of MCV but was too young to receive 
the second dose; or (4) was only eligible to receive one 
MCV dose according to the national schedule and was not 
the target of an additional dose in a national SIA. Balancing 
immuno 
genicity with disease burden, 82 countries 
recommend the first dose of MCV be given at 8–9 months 
of age, with the remaining countries recommending older 
ages for the first dose of vaccine. The second dose of MCV 
is frequently given in the second year of life, although 
some countries provide the second dose to school-aged 
children. People with measles born before 1980 were 
categorised separately because it was assumed that 
these were ineligible for two doses of MCV and would 
probably have been exposed to wildtype measles virus. 
People with measles with an unknown vaccination status 
who were younger than the recom 
mended age of 
administration of the first dose of MCV were assumed to 
be unvaccinated and categorised as programmatically 
non-preventable.
Statistical analysis
Frequencies and percentages were calculated by prog-
rammatically preventable and non-preventable cases by 
year of onset and by region. Percentages were calculated 
in one of two ways. The primary analysis included cases 
with an unknown vaccination status; the secondary 
analysis excluded those with an unknown vaccination 
status. Among programmatically non-preventable cases, 
frequencies and percentages were calculated for the 
four categories of reasons for programmatically non-
preventable cases; patients born before 1980 were 
excluded from this specific analysis. Among preventable 
cases, frequencies and percentages were calculated by age 
group (<1 year, 1 year to <5 years, 5 years to <15 years, 
15 years to <30 years, and ≥30 years) to assess whether 
failure to vaccinate with two doses was a problem 
associated with specific time periods. Frequencies and 
percentages were also calculated by measles elimination 
status (endemic status or interrupted or eliminated 
status) based on regional verification commissions; 
χ² p values were calculated by comparing proportions of 
preventable cases with known vaccination status by 
elimination status. If, by Dec 31, 2017, a country was 
verified as having interrupted or eliminated measles 
transmission, it was classified as interrupted or elimi-
nated; otherwise the country was classified as endemic.3 
Data were analysed with SAS, version 9.4.

from 147 (76%) of 194 countries; 7850 (1%) cases were 
excluded because they did not provide age at onset so 
626 289 were included in our analysis (figure 1). 
191 333 (31%) of the 626 289 cases could not be classified 
as preventable or not because of unknown vaccination 
status. By country, the median proportion with an 
unknown vaccination status was 30% (IQR 12–48). Of 
the remaining 434 956 cases with available vaccination 
data, 275 754 (63%) were categorised as programmatically 
preventable and 156 384 (36%) were non-preventable. 
39 775 (36%) of 111 289 cases in 2016 (61% of those with 
known vaccination status) to 77 876 (58%) of 133 538 in 
2013 (72% of those with known vaccination status) per 
year were categorised as programmatically preventable, 
whereas 30 044 (22%) of 133 538 in 2013 (28% of those 
with known vaccination status) to 39 700 (27%) of 
145 865 in 2015 (41% of those with known vaccination 
status) of cases per year were categorised as program-
matically non-preventable (figure 2).
All WHO regions had data for all years except the 
southeast Asia region, which only had data from 
Jan 1, 2015, to Dec 31, 2017
. 224 093 (36%) of the 626 289 
cases of measles in 2013–17 occurred in the Africa region; 
the lowest number of cases occurred in the region of the 
Americas (1316 [<1%]), which is not unexpected because 
this region was verified as achieving measles elimi-
nation in 2016 (table). Of the total measles cases in 
the Africa region, 117 666 cases (53% of all cases; 66% of 
the 178 707 cases with known vaccination status) 
were classified as programmatically preventable because 
they did not receive age-appropriate doses of MCV. 
The proportion was similar in the eastern Mediterranean 
region (31 136 [51%] of 61 020 total cases; 62% of 
50 440 cases with known vaccination status), the southeast 
Asia region (43 292 [47%] of 91 704; 71% of 61 067), and the 
European region (48 525 [46%] of 105 851; 62% of 77 874). 
In the region of the Americas and the western Pacific 
region, vaccination data were not reported for more than 
50% of cases. For those with known vaccination status, 
27 (11%) of 257 cases in the region of the Americas 
and 35 108 (53%) of 66 611 in the western Pacific region 
were programmatically pre 
ventable. Across the regions, 
13–27% (29–89% of those with known vaccination status) 
of cases per year were programmatically non-preventable. 
Few people with measles were only ever eligible for one 
dose of vaccine on the basis of their birth year and national 
vaccination programme at the time; less than 1% of cases 
were in this category across the regions, except the Africa 
region, in which 30 808 (14%) of 224 093 cases were in this 
category. No more than 1% of cases in each region were in 
people born before 1980 (table).
When the 156 384 programmatically non-preventable 
cases were analysed, 38 677 (25% across all years; 
18–32% per year) were among people who had reportedly 
received at least two doses of MCV; 74 438 (48%; 41–59%) 
were among those who were too young to receive their 
first dose of MCV as per their national schedule (figure 3). 
An additional 11 914 (8%; 6–11%) of cases were in children 
who received one dose of MCV and were too young to 
receive their second dose, and 31 355 (20%; 15–27%) were 
among those who were only eligible for one dose on the 
basis of the national immunisation programme’s policy 
and no national SIA was targeting them.
Among programmatically preventable cases, 43–60% of 
cases per year were in children aged 1 year to younger 
than 5 years and 24–34% of cases per year were in those 
between the ages of 5 to less than 15 years (figure 4A). 
During 2013–17, 135 039 (49%) of 275 754 programmatically 
preventable cases were among children aged 1 year to 
younger than 5 years and 78 422 (28%) were among those 
aged 5 years to younger than 15 years. The Africa region, 
the region of the Americas, the eastern Mediterranean 
region, and the southeast Asia region had 77–91% of cases

aged 1 year to younger than 15 years (figure 4B). However, 
in the European region and the western Pacific region, 
55–57% of cases were in children aged 1 year to younger 
than 15 years and 27–28% of cases were in people aged 
15 years to younger than 30 years.
A different trend emerged when data were analysed 
by elimination or interruption statuses of countries 
(figure 5). During 2013–17, 262 597 (45%) of 581 171 mea-
sles cases in 93 endemic countries were programmat 
ic-
ally preventable (range 35% in 2016 to 60% in 2013); 
140 959 (24%) were programmatically non-preventable 
(22% in 2013 to 26% in 2017), and 174 930 (30%) were of 
unknown vaccination status (18% in 2013 to 41% in 2016; 
figure 5A). During the same period, 13 157 (29%) of 
45 118 cases in 54 countries that have interrupted or 
eliminated measles were programmatically preventable 
(range 15% in 2015 to 55% in 2016); 15 425 (34%) were 
programmatically non-preventable (24% in 2016 to 40% 
in 2015) and 16 403 (36%) were of unknown vaccination 
status and could not be classified (range 15–55% per year; 
figure 5B). When analysed only in those with known 
vaccination status, 262 597 (65%) of 406 241 cases in 
endemic countries were programmatically preventable 
compared with 13 157 (46%) of 28 715 in countries that 
have interrupted or eliminated measles (p<0·0001). 
When reasons for cases that were programmatically non-
preventable were analysed, similar distributions were 
reported across regions (figure 6). In endemic countries, 
34 708 (25%) of 140 959 cases reportedly received at least 
two doses of MCV compared with 3969 (26%) of 
15 425 cases in interrupted or eliminated countries. In 
endemic coun 
tries, 65 230 (46%) were too young for their 
first dose of MCV, compared to 9208 (60%) in interrupted 
or eliminated countries. Most notably, 31 250 (22%) of the 
cases in endemic countries were in people who were only 
ever eligible for one dose of vaccine, compared with 
105 (1%) of those in interrupted or eliminated countries 
(figure 6A, B). When analysed at the country level, 
countries with a higher proportion of programmatically 
preventable cases had more cases than those with a 
higher proportion of programmatically non-preventable 
cases (data not shown).
Discussion
Globally, during 2013–17, 63% of measles cases with 
vaccination status information were programmatically 
preventable—ie, due to failure of the immunisation 
programme to vaccinate the person with the recom-
mended age-appropriate number of MCV doses. 
Theoretically, all cases of measles are preventable either 
directly by inducing active immunity through vaccination 
or indirectly by inducing sufficient overall immunity in 
the population that exceeds herd immunity thresholds 
thereby preventing exposure of susceptible people to the 
measles virus. However, this analysis was focused on 
establishing what proportion of cases could be directly 
prevented by better implementation of recommendations 
for vaccination (ie, programmatically preventable) or 
could only be protected indirectly through herd im-
munity, on the basis of recommendations for measles 
vaccination (ie, programmatically non-preventable).
Of programmatically preventable cases, 77% were 
among children aged 1 year to less than 15 years, who are 
frequently the primary focus of immunisation program-
mes. This result highlights that better implementation 
of routine immunisation and SIAs are needed to reduce 
the number of cases of measles. Reasons behind why 
these people were not vaccinated cannot be ascertained 
from surveillance data and requires more in-depth 
investigation to understand this programme failure. 
Potential reasons include no access to vaccination 
services, parental attitudes and knowledge, and problems 
with the immuni 
sation system such as insufficient 
supplies and gaps in health-care workers’ knowledge 
(eg, false contra 
indications or fear of wasting vaccine).14,15
Cases that were categorised as programmatically non-
preventable deserve further analysis, ideally on a country-

by-country basis. 14% of programmatically non-preventable 
cases in the Africa region were only ever eligible for one 
dose of MCV; this population should be the target of 
vaccination efforts to close any immunity gaps. If a 
country has a high proportion of cases occurring in people 
younger than the age of administration of the first or 
second dose, a more detailed analysis should be done to 
inform the relevant national immunisation technical 
advisory group if a change to the recommended age of 
administration is warranted.
Countries that have interrupted or eliminated measles 
have a higher proportion of cases that were program-
matically non-preventable than endemic countries. This 
does not appear to be because there is a disproportionate 
number of cases among two-dose vaccine recipients but 
is driven by infants acquiring measles who are too young 
to be vaccinated. Incidence of measles globally is always 
highest in children too young to be vaccinated, and these 
infants can be protected by achieving herd im 
munity in 
the population. Countries need to individually classify 
their cases as programmatically preventable or non-
preventable, in line with recom 
mendations from the 
midterm review of the measles and rubella global 
strategic plan for 2012–20, to understand whether they 
need to lower the age of their first or second dose of 
MCV.10
One problem that this analysis highlighted was that, 
during 2013–17, 31% of cases were in people with an 
unknown vaccination status, with half of the regions 
having more than 30% of cases with unknown vaccination 
status. The proportion of cases that were in people with 
unknown vaccination status did not appear to decrease 
over time—a marked failure of the surveillance system. 
For each country, elimination-standard measles surveil-
lance should attempt to obtain vaccination status on at 
least 80% of cases, and many countries in this analysis 
are failing to achieve this target.2 Systems should be 
strengthened to promote the retention by families of 
home-based vac 
cination records, because knowing the 
vaccination status of measles cases (or of any vaccine-
preventable disease) is crucial to improving the pro-
gramme and changing vaccination policies. Without 
vaccination statuses of cases, it is unclear whether the 
case is because of a failure to vaccinate or a failure of 
vaccine policy. Countries can look to the practical 
guidance published by WHO for promoting home-based 
records to help strengthen their programme.16
This analysis is subject to several limitations. 31% had 
an unknown vaccination status; the true vaccination 
status of this large proportion could significantly affect 
the results but cannot be accounted for. Additionally, 
available vaccination data are frequently provided by 
parental recall, which could lead to erroneous clas-
sification.17–19 Those born before 1980 could not be 
classified because historical data were unavailable before 
1980, although this group accounted only for 0·4% of 
cases. People with measles were assumed to have lived 
in the country from which they were reported from for 
their entire lives, because history of migration and travel 
was unknown. Thus, some cases might have been mis-
classified if they were subject to another country’s 
immunisation schedule or SIAs during childhood. The 
age of administration of MCV doses used to calculate 
eligibility for doses on the basis of age was assumed to 
be static over time because historical data were not 
available for all years. Only national SIAs and national 
second-dose MCV introduction were accounted for, and 
some might have been eligible for additional doses of 
vaccine during subnational vaccine introductions, 
subnational SIAs, and outbreak responses. However, 
subnational SIA and outbreak response eligibility mostly 
affect the 5% of cases that were classified as being only 
eligible for one dose of vaccine on the basis of the 
national schedule and national SIA eligibility. Because 
this is a global analysis, we could not account for

country-to-country and within-country variations, which 
could be significant. A large outbreak in one country 
could skew this analysis because this analysis focused on 
the proportion of cases. Elimination status of a country 
might be classified erroneously as endemic, because the 
Africa and the eastern Mediterranean regions have only 
convened verification commissions in 2018 to assess a 
country’s elimination status. Finally, not every country 
reported case-based data to WHO, surveillance quality is 
variable, and in some countries, case-base surveillance 
is sentinel (ie, only done in a few selected health facilities 
that might not be representative of the wider population). 
Thus, cases might not be representative of all cases. For 
example, those without access to vaccination services 
also probably have poor access to health care and are less 
likely to be detected by surveillance, leading to fewer 
programmatically prevent 
able cases in this analysis. By 
contrast, health-care workers might be less likely to 
report and test cases among fully vaccinated people, 
leading to a decreased proportion of program 
matically 
non-preventable cases.
Notwithstanding these limitations, most cases in the 
world in the past 5 years have been due to failure of 
immunisation programmes to vaccinate children acc-
ording to recommendations in their national immuni-
sation schedule. Greater focus needs to be placed on 
vaccinating these unreached children.
