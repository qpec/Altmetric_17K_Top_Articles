 Summary. Assessment of dynamic inspiratory function may provide valuable information about
the degree and progression of pulmonary involvement in patients with Duchenne muscular
dystrophy (DMD). The aims of this study were to characterize inspiratory function and to assess
the efficacy of idebenone on this pulmonary function outcome in a large and well-characterized
cohort of 10–18 year-old DMD patients not taking glucocorticoid steroids (GCs) enrolled in the
phase 3 randomized controlled DELOS trial. We evaluated the effect of idebenone on the highest
flow generated during an inspiratory FVC maneuver (maximum inspiratory flow; V’I,max(FVC))
and the ratio between the largest inspiratory flow during tidal breathing (tidal inspiratory flow;
V’I,max(t)) and the V’I,max(FVC). The fraction of the maximum flow that is not used during tidal
breathing has been termed inspiratory flow reserve (IFR). DMD patients in both treatment
groups of DELOS (idebenone, n ¼ 31; placebo: n ¼ 33) had comparable and abnormally low
V’I,max(FVC) at baseline. During the study period, V’I,max(FVC) further declined by �0.29 L/sec
in patients on placebo (95%CI: �0.51, �0.08; P ¼ 0.008 at week 52), whereas it remained stable in
patients on idebenone (change from baseline to week 52: 0.01 L/sec; 95%CI: �0.22, 0.24;
P ¼ 0.950). The between-group difference favoring idebenone was 0.27 L/sec (P ¼ 0.043) at
week 26 and 0.30 L/sec (P ¼ 0.061) at week 52. In addition, during the study period, IFR improved
by 2.8% in patients receiving idebenone and worsened by �3.0% among patients on placebo
(between-group difference 5.8% at week 52; P ¼ 0.040). Although the clinical interpretation of
these data is currently limited due to the scarcity of routine clinical practice experience with
dynamic inspiratory function outcomes in DMD, these findings from a randomized controlled
study nevertheless suggest that idebenone preserved inspiratory muscle function as assessed
by V’I,max(FVC) and IFR in patients with DMD. Pediatr Pulmonol. 2017;52:508–515.

INTRODUCTION
Duchenne muscular dystrophy (DMD), the most
common and severe neuromuscular disorder of childhood,
is an inexorably progressive and ultimately fatal X-linked
disease, characterized by muscle degeneration and atro-
phy.1 DMD patients generally lose ambulation before the
age of 12 and develop respiratory or cardiac complications
in their late teenage years. Routine use of glucocorticoid
steroids (GCs) and the introduction of mechanical
insufflation–exsufflation devices to improve airway clear-
ance and non-invasive ventilation to prevent hypoventila-
tion have become standard of care which together have
increased survival in DMD to late in the second and
frequently well into the third decade.2–5 Indeed, progres-
sive respiratory muscle weakness leads to restrictive
respiratory disease, hypoventilation, ineffective cough,
recurrent pulmonaryinfections,atelectasis,andrespiratory
failure.6–8 Accordingly, serial measurement of lung
function is an important part of the standard of care of
patients with DMD.9
Respiratory function and respiratory muscle strength in
patients with DMD can be assessed by measuring lung
volumes10 (e.g., forced vital capacity [FVC] and forced
expiratory volume in one second [FEV1]) and flows (peak
expiratory flow [PEF]) as well as inspiratory and
expiratory static airway pressures (e.g., maximal inspira-
tory pressure [MIP] and maximal expiratory pressure
[MEP]). Since a FVC maneuver requires both maximal
inspiration and exhalation, and PEF requires maximal
expiratory muscle function, loss of this muscle function
will produce a decline in both FVC and PEF.11–15 Yet,

 these maneuvers require maximal effort and cooperation,
and can be challenging to perform in young patients and
patients with cognitive disability.
In DMD patients, diaphragm and inspiratory muscle
function are progressively impaired. Therefore, assessing
dynamic inspiratory muscle function may also provide
additional information on the status and progression of
pulmonary involvement in patients with DMD.16 Indeed,
the largest flow generated during an inspiratory FVC
maneuver (maximum inspiratory flow; V’I,max(FVC)) is
abnormally reduced and the ratio between the largest
inspiratory flow during tidal breathing (tidal inspiratory
flow; V’I,max(t)) and the V’I,max(FVC) is increased
and the resulting inspiratory flow reserve (IFR)16
consequently decreased.
In a recent Phase 3 randomized, placebo-controlled
clinical
trial
(DELOS;
ClinicalTrials.gov
number:
NCT01027884)
in
patients
with
DMD
not
using
concomitant GCs, idebenone, a short-chain benzoqui-
none, has been shown to reduce the loss of respiratory
function as assessed by PEF, FVC, and FEV1 over the
52-week study period.17 The aims of the present analysis
were to characterize dynamic inspiratory muscle function
in the largest cohort of DMD patients analyzed thus far for
this parameter, and to assess the efficacy of idebenone
compared to placebo on this inspiratory function outcome
in the DELOS population.
PATIENTS AND METHODS
The study population consisted of 64 patients aged
10–18 years (mean age, 14.3 years) with a documented
diagnosis of DMD. Subjects were enrolled in DELOS, a
multi-center, phase 3 clinical trial comparing the
efficacy of 900 mg/day idebenone (Raxone1 provided
by Santhera Pharmaceuticals, Liestal, Switzerland)
compared to placebo.17 Patients were eligible if they
had a PEF percent predicted (PEF%p) <80% at baseline
and had stopped taking GC at least 12 months prior to
enrollment. In addition, patients were not allowed to
take GC during the 52-week study period. Standard
spirometry was performed at hospital visits at baseline
and at weeks 13, 26, 39, and 52 using a Pneumotrac
Spirometer 6800 (Vitalograph, Buckingham, UK) with
the aid of a qualified, trained, and certified operator and
in accordance with the American Thoracic Society/
European Respiratory Society guidelines.18 For PEF,
FVC, and FEV1, the largest available test result from a
minimum of three and up to five consecutive maneuvers
was used. Since lung volume and associated pulmonary
function is influenced by height, race, and age, these
measures are presented relative to normative data as
percent of predicted, which allows for longitudinal
comparison.17–20 Similarly, for MIP and MEP, the
highest value from a minimum of three and up to five
consecutive maneuvers was used and normalized using
established equations.21 Patient height was derived from
ulnar length measures.22,23
In order to evaluate inspiratory function, patients
were asked to breathe normally and perform several
tidal breaths into the spirometer. At the end of the
inspiratory tidal breathing, the patient was asked to
perform a maximal exhalation followed by a maximal
inspiratory maneuver to total lung capacity (Fig. 1).
Patients performed between three and five consecutive
inspiratory function maneuvers at each study visit
following the PEF and FVC function tests. Sufficient
time was allowed for patients to rest between pulmonary
function tests as well as between individual maneuvers
to minimize fatigue. All available data obtained from
inspiratory function tests were recorded and stored
without assessment of acceptability, as at this time no
acceptance criteria for this maneuver are available.
From any individual inspiratory function maneuver,
the maximum inspiratory flow during tidal breathing
(V’I,max(t)) and the maximum inspiratory flow during
an inspiratory FVC maneuver (V’I,max(FVC)) was
recorded as described by De Bruin et al.16 (Fig. 1). To
limit the influence of both spuriously low and high tidal
flow values without requiring a manual assessment of
the quality of the tidal breathing, the lowest of the
available V’I,max(t) recorded during a set of consecu-
tive tests was used to calculate the inspiratory flow ratio
as the ratio between the V’I,max(t) determined as
described above and the highest V’I,max(FVC) avail-
able from the set of consecutive maneuvers. In addition,

residual volume and makes a maximum inspiratory effort to total
lung capacity. The largest value during tidal breathing (V’I,max(t))
and the largest value of inspiratory flow during the maximum
effort maneuver (V’I,max(FVC)) are determined. The inspiratory
flow ratio is calculated as V’I,max(t)/V’I,max(FVC) and the IFR is
calculated as 1 � (V’I,max(t)/V’I,max(FVC)) and expressed as
percentage. In addition, the difference V’I,max(FVC) � V’I,max(t)
is expressed as IFR in L/sec.

 the inspiratory flow reserve (IFR), a pre-specified
tertiary endpoint of the DELOS trial, was calculated
as 1 – (V’I,max(t)/V’I,max(FVC)) and expressed as
percentage. According to data from De Bruin et al.,16
the inspiratory flow ratio is increased and consequently
the IFR is reduced in patients with DMD compared to
healthy subjects (i.e., a lower IFR value indicates more
severe functional impairment). As a sensitivity analysis,
IFR values were also calculated using both V’I,max(t)
and V’I,max(FVC) from the same individual maneuver,
and the highest (i.e., best) IFR expressed as percentage
was selected for comparison. The reserve in flow was
also analyzed as IFR and expressed in L/sec, determined
as the difference V’I,max(FVC) – V’I,max(t).
Change from baseline and differences in treatment
groups was analyzed using a mixed model for repeated
measures (MMRM) using SAS 9.3,24 as described
previously.17
For
comparisons
between
treatment
groups, all available data from all post-baseline visits
were used as response variables in the model. Treatment
group, visit, and the interaction between the treatment
group and visit were used as fixed factors in the model
and the baseline assessment as a covariate. Within-
subject coefficients of variation and correlations between
parameters (Spearman’s rho) were calculated using R.25
RESULTS
Patient demographics of the DELOS trial have been
previously reported17 and are briefly summarized in
Table 1. At baseline, patients (N ¼ 64) had an average age
of 14.3 years (SD: 2.7, range: 10.1–19.0), 59 (92.2%)
were non-ambulatory and 28 (43.8%) had never used GC.
Previous GC users had stopped taking GCs at least
12 months prior to enrollment (mean: 3.7 years, SD: 2.1
years, range: 0.9–8.9 years).17 The baseline character-
istics of pulmonary function parameters are shown in
Table 2; there were no statistically significant differences
between treatment groups for any of the expiratory and
inspiratory function tests and for maximum static airway
pressures.
As previously described in the original report of this
study,17 treatment effects for idebenone were observed
for the change in PEF, FEV1, and FVC (reported as
percent predicted or non-normalized values). Specifi-
cally, between-group differences for PEF%p, PEF, FVC,
FEV1%p, and FEV1 for the change from baseline to
week 52 were statistically significant and between-
group differences for FVC%p reached a strong trend
(P < 0.05 at weeks 13, 26, and 39; P ¼ 0.082 at week
52).17 Overall, the results of the study indicate a

Effects of Idebenone on Inspiratory Function in DMD
511
Pediatric Pulmonology
 consistent slowing of the decline of these pulmonary
function outcomes. On the other hand, no statistically
significant differences between idebenone and placebo
groups were seen for changes in MIP and MEP. The lack
of effect for the outcome in MIP and MEP could be
explained by severe disability at baseline (Table 2) and
early appearance of floor effects. Historically, decline in
MIP and MEP have been shown to be among the first
signs of respiratory dysfunction in DMD.15 Baseline
data from this study are consistent with data reported
from a large natural history study demonstrating
severely reduced values of MIP and MEP at very young
ages.26–28 Furthermore, in patients 10–18 years of age as
included in the DELOS study, MIP and MEP do not
consistently decline28 which could have influenced the
outcomes for these parameters.
Characterization of V’I,max(FVC) in DMD Patients
Patients enrolled in the DELOS trial had abnormal
V’I,max(FVC) at baseline (2.79 L/sec, SD: 0.87; Table 2)
consistent with the data reported by De Bruin et al.16
V’I,max(FVC) correlated well with PEF (r ¼ 0.63), FEV1
(r ¼ 0.51), and FVC (r ¼ 0.47) (Table 3), and was reliably
performed
by
all
patients.
On
the
other
hand,
V’I,max(FVC) correlated weakly with MEP (r ¼ 0.26).
Additional analysis revealed that V’I,max(FVC) was
similar irrespective of GC use and ambulatory status at
baseline (Table 4). On the other hand, as expected, older
patients (above 14 years, median age of the study) had
larger V’I,max(FVC) compared to the younger patient
subgroup (below 14 years), probably due to body growth.
As the V’I,max(t) did not differ between age groups, this
resulted in higher (e.g., better preserved) IFR in older
patients compared to younger patients.
Longitudinal Change in V’I,max(FVC) and IFR and
Effect of Idebenone
During the study period, V’I,max(FVC) continued to
decline in patients on placebo, with a change from baseline
to week 52 of �0.29 L/sec (95%CI: �0.51, �0.08;
P ¼ 0.008). Conversely, among patients in the idebenone
group, the V’I,max(FVC) remained stable throughout the
study period with a change from baseline to week 52 of
0.01 L/sec (95%CI: �0.22, 0.24; P ¼ 0.950), resulting in a
between-group difference of 0.30 L/sec (95%CI: �0.01,
0.62; P ¼ 0.061) (Fig. 2).
Likewise, during the study period, IFR increased
by 2.8% (indicating improvement; 95%CI: �1.3, 6.8;
P ¼ 0.174)
among
patients
receiving
idebenone
and
decreased
by
�3.0%
(indicating
worsening;
95%CI: �6.8, 0.7; P ¼ 0.114) among patients on placebo
with a significant between-group difference at 52 weeks
of 5.78% (95%CI: 0.28, 11.27; P ¼ 0.040) (Fig. 3).
Similar results were obtained when the best IFR was
calculated from V’I,max(t) paired with V’I,max(FVC),
both obtained from one individual maneuver. For this
sensitivity analysis, the change from baseline to week 52
was 3.3% (95%CI: �1.2, 7.8; P ¼ 0.149) for the idebenone
group compared to �1.7% (95%CI: �5.9, 2.5; P ¼ 0.430)
fortheplacebogroup.Thebetween-groupdifferenceforthe
change from baseline to week 52 was 5.0% (95%CI: �1.2,
11.2; P ¼ 0.113) in favor of idebenone treatment.
In an alternative analysis, IFR was calculated as the
difference between V’I,max(FVC) and V’I,max(t) and
expressed in L/sec. Here, the idebenone-treated patients
also remained stable compared to a steady decline,
indicating worsening, seen in patients in the placebo
group (Fig. 4). The between-group difference was
statistically significant from week 26 onwards and
reached a difference of 0.35 L/sec at week 52 (95%CI:
0.07, 0.63; P ¼ 0.016).

 DISCUSSION
This additional analysis of the DELOS trial indicates
that inspiratory function is significantly impaired in
10–18-year-old DMD patients not taking GC and
demonstrates that idebenone significantly reduces the
loss of pulmonary function as assessed by inspiratory flow
reserve. A non-significant trend (P ¼ 0.061) favoring
idebenone at week 52 was also observed on V’I,
max(FVC). These findings corroborate previously re-
ported data on the efficacy of idebenone in preserving
expiratory muscle function in this patient population.17
Maximum inspiratory flow (e.g., the largest inspiratory
flow generated during an inspiratory FVC maneuver,
V’I,max (FVC)) provides an estimate of inspiratory
muscle function in patients with DMD.16 In chronic
neuromuscular diseases, decreases in V’I,max(FVC) may
be proportionately greater than maximum expiratory
flow.29,30 This difference, which in DMD is augmented by
the involvement of the diaphragm, is due to the effort–
dependence of V’I,max(FVC) and is amplified by an
increase in lung recoil that offsets the effects of muscle
weakness on expiration, but decreases the flow produced
by a given (negative) pleural pressure on inspiration.31
De Bruin et al.16 have shown that maximum inspiratory
flow isreduced inpatientswithDMD,and as a result ofthat
the inspiratory flow ratio is increased and consequently the
IFR reduced, both indicative of inspiratory function loss.
The analysis we performed on the DELOS population
generally confirms these findings. However, DMD patients
in DELOS had higher V’I,max(FVC) at baseline (2.77
L/sec in the idebenone group and 2.82 L/sec in the placebo
group) than those in the De Bruin study (2.17L/sec).16
Similarly, FVC was also higher in DELOS (1.88L in the
idebenone group and 1.86 L in the placebo group) than in
the De Bruin study (1.64L). Both differences could be
explained by the older age (13.5 years and 15.0 years in the
idebenone and placebo groups, respectively vs. 12.8 years)
and the fact that patients were taller (157 cm and 162 cm in
the idebenone and placebo groups, respectively vs.
148 cm)16 in DELOS. In addition, since the De Bruin
study was published over 10years ago, improvedstandards
of care may also have accounted for a better preserved
pulmonary function in patients with DMD enrolled in
DELOS. Interestingly, both V’I,max(FVC) and IFR were
not better in previous GC users compared to GC-na

Effects of Idebenone on Inspiratory Function in DMD

 patients, suggesting that the favorable long-term effect of
GCuseonpulmonary functionhad disappeared bythe time
patients enrolled in the study.
Our findings for V’I,max(FVC) and IFR point toward a
protective role of idebenone on inspiratory muscle
function such as the diaphragm, which is of clinical
relevance. Indeed, contrary to earlier suggestions that the
diaphragm might be selectively spared until a late phase
of the disease,32 it has been demonstrated that diaphragm
thickness is increased in patients with DMD below the age
of 12 years due to connective tissue infiltration and fat
deposition.33 Diaphragm pseudo-hypertrophy, which is
similar to that observed in some limb muscle groups, is
associated with significant reductions in spirometric
measurements such as FEV1, FVC, and PEF.33 Moreover,
the diaphragm is in constant use and often displays the
most severe pathology, as demonstrated in animal models
of muscular dystrophy, leading to the conclusion that
exercise may exacerbate degeneration.34
The clinical interpretation of the results reported here is
limited by the fact that dynamic inspiratory function tests
are currently not performed in the routine follow-up of
DMD patients. Furthermore, as this is the second report
on inspiratory function in DMD patients following the
first description by De Bruin et al.,16 there is currently a
lack of reference data from natural history studies that
would enable interpretation of the clinical relevance of the
observed outcomes. Clearly, further work is needed to
correlate changes in inspiratory functions tests to
pulmonary function test outcomes commonly accepted
to be of clinical relevance to DMD patients, such as
decline in FVC or PEF. As available data are currently not
sufficient to allow for such comparisons, measures of
inspiratory function and changes observed are to be
regarded as exploratory in nature and therefore robust
clinical conclusions cannot be derived at this time.
However, as inspiratory maneuvers assess the function of
different muscle groups compared to those assessed
during expiratory function tests (e.g., FVC, PEF), such
data could still provide useful information.
In summary, idebenone reduced the loss of inspiratory
pulmonary function as assessed by V’I,max(FVC) and
IFR in patients with DMD. Stabilization of respiratory
muscle function may potentially delay the emergence of
respiratory failure in these patients. Although the
clinical interpretation of these data is currently limited,
these findings nevertheless expand on the previously
reported effect of idebenone on expiratory muscle
function in DMD patients and are of special interest as
inspiratory and expiratory maneuvers rely on a different
set of muscles. Studies of longer duration will be needed
to further corroborate the encouraging treatment effects
of idebenone on respiratory function outcomes as
observed in the randomized controlled DELOS study.
Of particular relevance will be the correlation between
changes in pulmonary function outcomes and the
clinical course over time. In this context, it is of
particular interest that patients in the idebenone group of
the DELOS study experienced fewer and shorter
bronchopulmonary
complications
(such
as
airway
infections) compared to patients in the placebo group,
which is of clinical relevance.35
