SUMMARY
Chronic inflammatory diseases such as arthritis are characterized by dysregulated responses to pro-inflammatory cytokines such as inter-
leukin-1 (IL-1) and tumor necrosis factor a (TNF-a). Pharmacologic anti-cytokine therapies are often effective at diminishing this inflam-
matory response but have significant side effects and are used at high, constant doses that do not reflect the dynamic nature of disease
activity. Using the CRISPR/Cas9 genome-engineering system, we created stem cells that antagonize IL-1- or TNF-a-mediated inflamma-
tion in an autoregulated, feedback-controlled manner. Our results show that genome engineering can be used successfully to rewire
endogenous cell circuits to allow for prescribed input/output relationships between inflammatory mediators and their antagonists,
providing a foundation for cell-based drug delivery or cell-based vaccines via a rapidly responsive, autoregulated system. The customiza-
tion of intrinsic cellular signaling pathways in stem cells, as demonstrated here, opens innovative possibilities for safer and more effective
therapeutic approaches for a wide variety of diseases.
INTRODUCTION
Chronic inflammatory and autoimmune diseases such as
arthritis are characterized by aberrant activity of cytokines
such as tumor necrosis factor a (TNF-a) and interleukin-1
(IL-1). These pro-inflammatory mediators are expressed by
a variety of cells, including synovial cells, osteoblasts, myo-
tubes, satellite cells, chondrocytes,andinnate immune cells.
These cell types are also capable of responding to TNF-a and
IL-1 through canonical signaling via cognate cell surface re-
ceptors. Under normal physiologic conditions, appropriate
signaling of TNF-a and IL-1 contributes to organ and tissue
homeostasis by promoting tissue remodeling (Banno et al.,
2004; Furman et al., 2014; Gerstenfeld et al., 2003; Kim-
merling et al., 2015; Peralta Soler et al., 1996), orchestrating
phagocytosis of cellular debris and immunogenic substrates
(Michlewska et al., 2009), and coordinating transitions be-
tween niche stem cell quiescence and proliferation/differen-
tiation programs (Palacios et al., 2010; Rebel et al., 1999;
Rezzoug et al., 2008). However, in chronic diseases, elevated
levels of these pro-inflammatory cytokines can lead directly
to pain (Marchand et al., 2005), cytotoxicity (Georgopoulos
et al., 1996), accelerated tissue catabolism (Bonaldo and San-
dri, 2013; Reid and Li, 2001), and exhaustion of resident
stem cell niches (Palacios et al., 2010).
A number of exogenous anti-cytokine therapies have
been shown to effectively counteract the negative sequelae
of TNF-a and IL-1 dysregulation. In particular, anti-TNF
therapies such as the soluble type 2 TNF receptor (etaner-
cept) and monoclonal antibodies to TNF-a (adalimumab,
infliximab) have demonstrated efficacy toward offsetting
pain associated with chronic and rheumatic diseases,
including arthritis (Scott and Kingsley, 2006). The soluble
type 1 TNFR receptor (sTNFR1) has also been investigated
as a gene therapy for treatment of chronic diseases (Khoury
et al., 2007). More recently, competitive antagonists of IL-1
such as IL-1 receptor antagonist (IL-1Ra, anakinra) have
been shown to alleviate symptoms of rheumatoid arthritis
(Choy et al., 2013) and the onset of post-traumatic arthritis
(Furman et al., 2014). Although they are effective, these
therapies are administered at very high and generally un-
regulated doses. Due to the pleiotropic roles of TNF-a and
IL-1 and their involvement in tissue homeostasis, the use
of such therapies may have significant side effects,
including increased susceptibility to infection as well as
to autoimmune diseases such as lupus, interstitial lung dis-
ease, and vasculitis (Ramos-Casals et al., 2008). Moreover,
excess inhibition of these cytokines can interfere with tis-
sue regeneration and repair (Gopinath and Rando, 2008;
Kimmerling et al., 2015; Mozzetta et al., 2009; Palacios
et al., 2010). Therefore, methods to dynamically deliver
precisely calibrated doses of anti-inflammatory biologic
therapies could improve treatments by combating cyto-
kine-mediated pain and degeneration while spatially and

 temporally regulating the production of anti-cytokine
drugs.
Here, we propose a regenerative medicine approach to the
treatment of chronic inflammatory diseases by engineering
cells that execute real-time, programmed responses to envi-
ronmental cues, including pro-inflammatory cytokines. We
used genome editing with the CRISPR/Cas9 system to create
stem cells that antagonize IL-1- and TNF-a-mediated inflam-
mation in an autoregulated manner. To achieve this, we
selected to overtake the chemokine (C-C) ligand 2 (Ccl2)
gene,whichisalsoknownasmacrophagechemoattractantpro-
tein-1 (Mcp-1). The Ccl2 gene product regulates trafficking of
monocytes/macrophages, basophils, and T lymphocytes
(Ping et al., 1999). TNF-a and IL-1 serve as two of the most
potent stimulators of Ccl2 expression (Boekhoudt et al.,
2003); however, the persistence of Ccl2 expression depends
on continued exposure to inflammatory cues (Hao and Bal-
timore, 2009), so resolution of inflammation results in rapid
decay of Ccl2 transcripts. Thus, we performed targeted gene
addition of IL-1 and TNF-a antagonists at the Ccl2 locus to
confer cytokine-activated and feedback-controlled expres-
sion of biologic therapies. These programmed stem cells
were then used to engineer articular cartilage tissue to estab-
lish the efficacy of self-regulated therapy toward protection
of tissues against cytokine-induced degeneration. We hy-
pothesized that this approach of repurposing normally in-
flammatory signaling pathways would allow for transient,
autoregulated production of cytokine antagonists in direct
response to cytokine stimulation. This type of approach
could provide an effective ‘‘vaccine’’ for the treatment of
chronic diseases while overcoming limitations associated
with delivery of large drug doses or constitutive overexpres-
sion of biologic therapies.
RESULTS
Clonal Isolation and Functional Validation
The primary goal of this work was to program induced
pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs) with the capacity to respond
to an inflammatory stimulus with potent and autono-
mously regulated anti-cytokine production (Figure 1A).
As such, we aimed to perform targeted gene addition to
the locus of the pro-inflammatory chemokine Ccl2, which
is potently activated in response to cytokine-mediated
signaling and of which disruption of a single allele would
not be expected to compromise overall cellular function.
Thus, transgenes encoding a firefly luciferase transcrip-
tional reporter or a cytokine antagonist, either murine IL-
1Ra or a chimeric human sTNFR1-murine immunoglob-
ulin G (Bloquel et al., 2004), were targeted to the Ccl2
start codon in murine iPSCs (Diekman et al., 2012) using
the CRISPR/Cas9 gene-editing platform. After hygromycin
selection, clonal isolation, and screening by PCR of the
junctions of the transgene and target locus, multiple clones
were identified that possessed targeted integration events
at the Ccl2 locus (Figure S1).
Clones for each transgene with targeted gene addition on
one allele were selected for further analysis (referred to as
Ccl2-Luc, Ccl2-Il1ra, or Ccl2-sTNFR1) and expanded on
murine embryonic fibroblasts (MEFs) followed by pre-dif-
ferentiation in micromass culture (Diekman et al., 2012).
First, we evaluated whether targeted transgene integration
at the Ccl2 start codon would enable cytokine-inducible
transgene expression. As a point of reference, wild-type
(WT) cells were treated with a range of TNF-a concentra-
tions (0.2–20 ng/mL), and mRNA was collected at 4, 12,
24, and 72 hr (Figure 1B). Ccl2 gene expression was evalu-
ated by qRT-PCR. At all TNF-a concentrations tested, Ccl2
gene expression was elevated at each time point compared
with cells cultured in the absence of TNF-a (p < 0.016). In
the 2-ng/mL and 20-ng/mL groups, Ccl2 gene expression
continued to increase throughout the 72-hr period of
TNF-a treatment (p < 1.8e-10).
Next, using two Ccl2-luciferase cell lines, we induced
luciferase expression by stimulating cells with 20 ng/mL
TNF-a to evaluate whether transgene expression reflected
endogenous Ccl2 expression in WT cells. Relative lumines-
cence measurements indicated that transgene expression
in both clones was indeed stimulated by cytokine and
increased across the 72-hr TNF-a treatment period (p <
8.5e-10, Figure 1C), consistent with findings from TNF-
induced Ccl2 expression in WT cells.
Dynamic, Feedback-Controlled Biologic Drug
Production in Stem Cells
We then probed the responsiveness of our engineered cells
endowed with Ccl2-driven anti-cytokine transgenes. We
performed these experiments primarily by evaluating
gene expression and transgene production in the Ccl2-
sTNFR1 group, as the inability of these murine cells to
otherwise produce this human transcript and protein
allows for direct conclusions regarding transgene produc-
tion from the Ccl2 locus.
Initially, we performed a time-course and dose-res-
ponse
experiment,
in
which
Ccl2-sTNFR1
and
WT
cells were treated with a range of TNF-a concentrations
(0.2–20 ng/mL) for a variety of times (4, 12, 24, and
72 hr). We measured the expression of the sTNFR1 trans-
gene at both the mRNA and protein levels by qRT-PCR
and ELISA, respectively. We also measured the expression
of Il6, a pro-inflammatory cytokine whose expression
serves as a sentinel marker of inflammation, at the mRNA
level by qRT-PCR in order to additionally characterize the
inflammatory response of the WT and engineered Ccl2-
sTNFR1 cells.

 As early as 4 hr after TNF-a treatment, the 2- and
20-ng/mL treatments significantly upregulated Il6 tran-
scription in both the WT and Ccl2-sTNFR1 cells, while
0.2 ng/mL did not significantly upregulate Il6 (Figure 2A).
At the 12-hr time point, Il6 expression was significantly
elevated at all TNF-a concentrations in WT cells; however,
Il6 was only significantly upregulated in the Ccl2-sTNFR1-
engineered cells at the 20-ng/mL level of TNF-a treatment
(Figure 2A). Even at the 20-ng/mL level of treatment, the
engineered cells showed a significantly lower level of Il6
induction than WT cells. At the 24-hr time point, the me-
dium and high concentrations of TNF-a drove an upregula-
tion of Il6 in WTcells, but only the high 20-ng/mL concen-
tration resulted in significant upregulation of Il6 in the
sTNFR1-engineered cells (Figure 2A). By the 72-hr time
point, all three doses of TNF-a resulted in significant upre-
gulation of Il6 in the WT cells, while TNF-a treatment only
induced an upregulation of Il6 in the Ccl2-sTNFR1 cells at
the 20-ng/mL treatment level (Figure 2A). These results
show reduced inflammatory response as a result of cyto-
kine-mediated induction of sTNFR1 from the Ccl2 locus.
To evaluate whether the observations of Il6 gene expres-
sion reflect the general state of inflammation in these cells,
we transduced WT and Ccl2-sTNFR1 cells with a lentiviral
vector delivering a nuclear factor kB (NF-kB) luminescence
reporter. We then treated these cells with 0 or 20 ng/mL
TNF-a and after 24, 48, and 72 hr measured luminescence
as a surrogate for activity of the NF-kB transcription factor,

Reprog-

in CRISPR/Cas9-Engineered Cells and Re-
sults Validating the Approach
(A) Top left: in wild-type (WT) cells, TNF-a
signaling through its type 1 receptor
initiates a cascade leading to nuclear
translocation and increased transcriptional
activity of NF-kB, activating an inflamma-
tory transcriptional program. One gene
rapidly and highly upregulated by cytokine-
induced NF-kB activity is Ccl2 (shown in
orange). Top right: a CRISPR/Cas9 RNA-
guided nuclease (not depicted) generates a
double-strand break in the endogenous
chromosomal locus near the start codon for
Ccl2. Provision of a targeting vector with a
transgene flanked by regions homologous
to the Ccl2 locus promotes the use of this
template for repair of the damaged allele in
a subset of cells. Bottom left: such alleles
would then be activated by TNF-a, which
would now induce expression of the soluble
TNF type 1 receptor (sTNFR1). Bottom right:
upon antagonism of TNF-a in the microen-
vironment, signal transduction through the
membrane
receptor
would
halt,
NF-kB
would remain sequestered in the cytoplasm,
and expression of the sTNFR1 transgene
would autonomously decay upon resolution
of the local inflammation.

 which is activated in response to various inflammatory sig-
nals. At 24 hr, the NF-kB transcriptional activity was upre-
gulated in both WTand Ccl2-sTNFR1 cells. However, at the
48- and 72-hr time points, a sharp decline in NF-kB tran-
scriptional activity was observed in engineered cells ex-
pressing sTNFR1 under control of the Ccl2 locus (Figure 2B).
Taken together, the Il6 gene expression and NF-kB tran-
scriptional assays further support that the Ccl2-sTNFR1
cells are capable of attenuating the TNF-a-induced regula-
tion of Il6 as well as a more general inflammatory state.
Furthermore, these results suggest that, after 3 days of
TNF-a treatment, the cells are capable of antagonizing
even a high (20 ng/mL) concentration of TNF-a, while con-
trol WT cells remain in a state of inflammation even after
treatment with only 0.2 ng/mL TNF-a.
To ascertain whether this attenuation was mediated by
cytokine-inducible production of the TNF-a antagonist
sTNFR1 from the engineered cells, we measured the expres-
sion of sTNFR1 transgene in parallel with Il6 expression.
We found that sTNFR1 expression was rapidly upregulated
at the 4-hr time point (Figure 2C). In the groups treated
with 0.2 and 2 ng/mL of TNF-a, transgene expression
began to decline between the 4- and 12-hr time points, in
accordance with the decreased Il6 expression (Figures 2A
and 2B). This transition likely reflects an attenuated state
of inflammation after low and medium treatment of
TNF-a. Ccl2-driven sTNFR1 expression continued to in-
crease through 24 hr in response to the high TNF-a treat-
ment, but this level declined rapidly toward baseline values
at 72 hr, consistent with an inflammatory signal at 24 hr
that largely resolved by 72 hr, as suggested by the Il6 and
NF-kB transcription data (Figures 2A and 2B). In accordance
with these qRT-PCR data, we measured increased accumu-
lation of sTNFR1 protein in culture media over time in a
dose-dependent fashion (Figure 2C).
We
then
performed
iterative
stimulation
of
Ccl2-
driven sTNFR1 and IL-1Ra cells in monolayer with either
0.1 ng/mL IL-1a or 20 ng/mL TNF-a. After 24 hr, the cyto-
kine-containing medium was exchanged for cytokine-free
medium, and specimens were collected. Three days later,
cells were stimulated with cytokine again to establish the
capacity of the cells to respond to recurrent stimulation
with cytokine. Control specimens without cytokine stimu-
lation were maintained in parallel. sTNFR1-engineered
cells displayed a basal level of production of less than
3 ng/mL (Figures 3A and 3B). Engineered cells rapidly

 produced sTNFR1 after either IL-1 or TNF-a stimulation
(Figures 3A and 3B). Withdrawal of cytokine-containing
medium resulted in a decline in sTNFR1 accumulation
over subsequent collection periods, irrespective of whether
IL-1 or TNF-a served as the stimulant. In both cases, pro-
duction of sTNFR1 decreased to basal levels within 48 hr
of removing cytokines (Figure 3A).
When treated with 0.1 ng/mL IL-1, which sTNFR1
should not antagonize, there was approximately 300-
fold stimulation of sTNFR1 production (Figure 3B) to
�630 ng/mL. When treated with 20 ng/mL TNF-a, produc-
tion of sTNFR1 increased only approximately 50-fold over
basal levels to �90 ng/mL. Similarly, treatment of Ccl2-
Il1ra cells with IL-1 resulted in an increase of IL-1Ra protein
in the medium of approximately 30-fold over basal levels of
expression to �180 ng/mL, whereas treatment with TNF-a
resulted in an increase of approximately 88-fold to
�570 ng/mL (Figure 3C). In WT cells, IL-1Ra production
after a single pulse was 1.65 ± 0.35, 1.74 ± 0.11, and
1.84 ± 0.16 ng/mL after treatment with no cytokine,
0.1 ng/mL IL-1, or 20 ng/mLTNF-a, respectively (Figure S2).
Thus, in the case of both Ccl2-Il1ra and Ccl2-sTNFR1 cells,
either IL-1 or TNF-a was capable of potently inducing trans-
gene expression. However, a lower level of induction was
achieved when an antagonizing therapy was produced in
response to the stimulatory cytokine.
Autoregulated Production of Cytokine Antagonists
Protects Engineered Cartilage from IL-1-
and TNF-Mediated Catabolism
After establishing that engineered cells express transgenes
in a cytokine-inducible manner and that Ccl2-driven
sTNFR1 provides a tunable and effective response to
even a high dose of TNF-a in monolayer experiments, we
assessed whether tissues engineered from engineered
stem cells could overcome the degenerative effects of
TNF-a and IL-1. To this end, we further differentiated the
WT, Ccl2-Luc, Ccl2-Il1ra, and Ccl2-sTNFR1 cells toward
the chondrocyte lineage for the production of engineered
cartilage
tissue
(Diekman
et
al.,
2012).
Engineered
tissues from WT and Ccl2-Luc cell lines were treated with
0 ng/mL cytokine, 0.1–1 ng/mL IL-1, or 20 ng/mL TNF-a.
Engineered tissues from Ccl2-Il1ra and Ccl2-sTNFR1 cell
lines were treated with only IL-1 or TNF-a, respectively, at
the same concentrations as WT and Ccl2-Luc tissues.
Engineered cartilage specimens derived from WTand Luc
cell lines exhibited a significant degradative response to
this 72-hr cytokine treatment. We measured the changes
in gene expression induced by 1 ng/mL IL-1 or 20 ng/mL
TNF-a by qRT-PCR (Figures 4 and 5, respectively) and
observed significant upregulation of markers of inflamma-
tion, such as Ccl2 and Il6, as well as degradative enzymes,
such
as
matrix
metalloproteinases
and aggrecanases.
Furthermore, significant suppression of expression of ma-
trix components of cartilage, including collagen type 2 a1
(Col2a1) and aggrecan (Acan), was noted in cartilage engi-
neered from either WT or Ccl2-Luc cells. The cartilage
derived from these control cell lines also displayed a loss
of sulfated glycosaminoglycan (sGAG), a major component
of articular cartilage critical to proper tissue function, in
response to both concentrations of IL-1 and to 20 ng/mL
TNF-a (Figures 6A–6D).
Cartilage derived from Ccl2-Il1ra or Ccl2-sTNFR1 cells
displayed a markedly different response to cytokine treat-
ment at the gene expression level. Tissue generated from
both the Ccl2-Il1ra and Ccl2-sTNFR1 cell lines demon-
strated lower induction levels of inflammatory and degra-
dative gene products compared with cartilage engineered

 from WT or Ccl2-Luc cell lines (Figures 4 and 5, respec-
tively). Although haploinsufficiency of the Ccl2 gene
affected basal levels of Ccl2 transcripts in the Ccl2-Luc,
Ccl2-sTNFR1, and Ccl2-Il1ra cells compared with WT cells,
cytokine stimulation rendered more marked upregulation
of Ccl2 in cartilage derived from the Luc cells than sTNFR1
or Il1ra cells at 72 hr, suggesting that these transgenes
ameliorated the impact of cytokine on Ccl2 gene expres-
sion, as expected. It is noteworthy, however, that in some
cases these genes were still significantly upregulated rela-
tive to tissues treated with 0 ng/mL cytokine. In the case
of Ccl2-sTNFR1, cartilage aggregates displayed resilience
after 72 hr of treatment with TNF-a, with no suppression
of Col2a1 or Acan. The preservation of a more homeostatic
gene expression profile was consistent with the biochem-
ical composition of cartilage aggregates engineered from
the Ccl2-sTNFR1 cell line, which demonstrated preserva-
tion of sGAG in the tissue even after treatment with
20 ng/mL TNF-a, as determined by both biochemical
and histologic analyses (Figures 6A and 6E). TNF-a
induced secretion of sTNFR1, as specimens treated with
20 ng/mL TNF-a produced 18.45 ± 0.17 ng/mL sTNFR1
and those cultured in the absence of TNF-a produced
only 3.31 ± 0.17 ng/mL sTNFR1.
However, Ccl2-driven expression of IL-1Ra was not suffi-
cient to protect against the suppression of the extracellular
matrix constituents Col2a1 and Acan by 1 ng/mL IL-1.
Coupled with the increased expression of degradative
enzymes, this resulted in loss of a significant fraction
of sGAG in the engineered tissue (Figure 6B). At the
0.1 ng/mL IL-1 level, cartilage derived from engineered
Ccl2-Il1ra cells was less susceptible to degradation than tis-
sue derived from control Ccl2-Luc cells, although sGAG
loss normalized to total DNA content was still statistically
significant after cytokine treatment in both tissue types
(Figures 6C and 6D). This protection, in comparison with
cartilage derived from Ccl2-Luc cells, was imparted by
the cytokine-induced expression of 20.50 ± 0.67 ng/mL
IL-1Ra, which was higher than the basal expression of
1.82 ± 0.24 ng/mL observed in the engineered cells or
0.88 ± 0.25 ng/mL observed in Ccl2-Luc cells.
DISCUSSION
Overcoming aberrant pro-inflammatory signals in chronic
diseases while preserving critical homeostatic signaling
nodes represents a significant challenge for regenerative
medicine. This work demonstrates the utility of genome
editing for the development of ‘‘designer’’ stem cells that
sense levels of inflammation and respond according to
the degree of the pathology. Using CRISPR/Cas9, we
engineered pluripotent stem cells with the prescribed
feature of inflammatory cytokine resistance by performing

 targeted addition of therapeutic transgenes to the cytokine-
responsive Ccl2 locus. Transgene expression from engi-
neered cells was feedback-controlled with rapid on/off
dynamics and was adequate to mitigate the inflammatory
effects of physiologic concentrations of both IL-1 and
TNF-a in the context of precursor cells cultured in mono-
layer as well as in engineered tissues such as cartilage. These
cells provide the foundation for a cell-based vaccine for the
treatment of a variety of autoimmune or inflammatory
diseases.
In this work, we sought to commandeer an endogenous
gene promoter to engineer custom-designed stem cells
with the ability to regulate anti-cytokine therapy in an
autonomous, real-time fashion. Critical to our selection
of Ccl2 as the target locus for controlling transgene expres-
sion is the temporal pattern associated with its cytokine-
inducible expression profile. By targeting our transgenes
to the Ccl2 start codon, we preserved many of the endoge-
nous regulatory features associated with Ccl2 expression,
including distal and proximal regulatory regions encom-
passing two NF-kB regulatory elements as well as SP1 and
AP-1 binding sites (Ping et al., 1999; Teferedegne et al.,
2006; Wang et al., 2000). As such, the repurposed Ccl2
promoter did indeed endow engineered cells with the
capacity to substantially upregulate transgene expression
in an inflammation-inducible manner. Importantly, this
upregulation was both dose- and time-dependent and
was transient in nature. Treatment with a range of TNF-a
concentrations spanning three orders of magnitude re-
sulted in differential induction of transgene transcription.
The concomitant decay in transgene expression and tran-
scription of markers of inflammation such as Il6 suggests
that cells were capable of autonomously tuning expression
of the transgene. Importantly, our experiments also
demonstrated that cells continue to respond to cytokines
by robustly producing additional therapy after iterative
exposure. Insertion of our transgene cassette did, however,
uncouple regulation of our system from the endogenous
AU-rich elements in the 30 UTR of Ccl2, which are thought
to play a role in driving transcript levels back toward a basal
state after inflammation is resolved (Hao and Baltimore,
2009). Despite this, expression of our transgenes did decay
after resolution of cytokine stimulation, which came about
by transgene therapy or simple withdrawal of cytokine. In
future iterations of this work, preservation of the AU-rich
elements in the transgene cassette may provide a means
whereby even more rapid declines in transgene expression
may be achieved.
Basal levels of transgene product were detected in the
absence of cytokine by ELISA. This observation is not
surprising, as Ccl2 is detected at the protein level
from certain tissues without activation from cytokines

 (Wang et al., 2000). Despite this, even low levels of
cytokine treatment were capable of inducing transgene
expression and initiating the inflammatory transcriptional
program, suggesting that basal levels of cytokine antago-
nists were insufficient to abolish signaling from low
concentrations of cytokine. Concentrations as low as
2–6 pg/mL (Li and Schwartz, 2001; Li, 2003) of TNF-a are
important for proper muscle regeneration and repair.
Thus, since the engineered cells are capable of responding
to low levels of cytokine, the basal levels of anti-cytokine
therapy may not preclude detection and response of niche
cells to low but critical levels of cytokine.
Our data reveal apparent differences in cell responses to
inflammatory cytokines depending on their differentiation
status or lineage commitment. We attribute this discrep-
ancy to potential differences in cell number, differentiation
state of the cells, and natural variation in gene expression
profiles of cells adopting different phenotypes. These
observations could also be strictly related to the physical
features of the different culture systems. Specifically, the
effective concentration of TNF-a or IL-1 could be reduced
by one to two orders of magnitude due to partitioning
within a tissue matrix. Moreover, secreted sTNFR1 and IL-
1Ra may remain bound by the rich extracellular matrix in
the engineered cartilage, whereas factors secreted by cells
in monolayer remain more readily accessible to diffusion
in culture media.
Previous investigators have taken various approaches to
confer inflammation-inducible, autoregulatory features to
target cells. A prevailing strategy has involved cloning
approximately 3 kb of characterized, cytokine-inducible
promoters upstream of transgene coding sequences. One
example of this strategy is the use of the E-selectin pro-
moter (Garaulet et al., 2013). In other studies, a self-
limiting promoter construct was developed based on a
truncated promoter sequence of cyclooxygenase-2 up-
stream of the IL-4 gene to express IL-4 only in the presence
of inflammation (Rachakonda et al., 2008). Alternatively,
tandem repeats of NF-kB response elements have been
used to drive transgene expression (Khoury et al., 2007;
van de Loo et al., 2004). These expression cassettes are typi-
cally delivered to cells by viral gene delivery. While these
approaches have indeed been proved to be effective at
generating cytokine-inducible expression, notable limita-
tions do exist. Most of these relate to the reliance on viral
vectors to deliver the expression cassette and include the
limited packaging capacity of adeno-associated virus,
which restricts the size of the cloned promoter sequence,

 and the potential for insertional mutagenesis by lentiviral
vectors. Furthermore, reported basal levels of transgenes
produced from these promoters have been high, and, in
some cases, growth factors other than inflammatory medi-
ators are needed to co-stimulate efficient induction of
transgene expression (Garaulet et al., 2013). While such
gene delivery vehicles carrying inflammation-inducible
cassettes could be delivered in vivo, this method lacks
cell- and tissue-targeting specificity.
Our work extends these efforts by directly targeting trans-
genes to inducible, endogenous loci using the efficient and
highly specific CRISPR/Cas9 genome-engineering technol-
ogy (Maeder and Gersbach, 2016; Jinek et al., 2012). In this
manner, our strategy forgoes limitations associated with
predicting regulatory features in a genetic locus such as
distal enhancers. In addition, this approach abrogates the
need to consider limitations on packaging efficiency, as
the entire regulatory region need not be packaged in a
gene delivery vector. Moreover, by performing targeted
integration, this strategy absolves concerns associated
with random insertion of provirus within the host genome.
Our use of iPSCs in these studies also provides an impor-
tant advance, as the base cell population can be precisely
defined and potentially undergo additional genome modi-
fications if needed. This approach may prove attractive for
regenerative medicine strategies, as clones may be screened
for function and then expanded and differentiated toward
a variety of terminal cell types to treat multiple tissues from
the same engineered cell population. To achieve the same
end, prior approaches would require isolation and expan-
sion of primary cells from multiple tissues, followed by
treatment of each population with gene delivery vehicles,
and finally delivery of engineered cells to the host. This
approach lacks the specificity conferred by targeting pre-
determined genomic sites for modification using gene-edit-
ing nucleases and requires that engineered, primary cells
do not senesce prior to serving a therapeutic purpose.
By performing targeted integration to the Ccl2 locus, we
rewired the transcriptional circuitry associated with in-
flammatory signaling in iPSCs. Additional strategies for
coupling input/output relationships in cell populations
are rapidly emerging in synthetic biology. Continued
development of toggle switches (Gardner et al., 2000;
Greber et al., 2008; Kobayashi et al., 2004; Kramer et al.,
2004), microRNA classifiers (Wroblewska et al., 2015; Xie
et al., 2011), and synthetic transcription regulators (Liu
et al., 2001; Perez-Pinera et al., 2013a, 2013b; Qi et al.,
2013) will facilitate the generation of complex circuits
capable of integrating multi-input cues and may enable a
cell to discern and respond specifically to not only varying
degrees of inflammation, but also a particular type of
inflammation. Furthermore, the autoregulated nature of
this approach may allow for therapeutic delivery during
early, possibly pre-symptomatic stages of diseases, effec-
tively providing the potential for biologic cell-based vac-
cines for autoimmune diseases. The customization of
intrinsic cellular signaling pathways in therapeutic stem
cell populations, as demonstrated in this work, opens inno-
vative possibilities for safer and more effective treatments
applicable to a wide variety of diseases.
EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURES
Induced Pluripotent Stem Cell Derivation and Culture
Murine iPSCs were derived and cultured as previously described
(Diekman et al., 2012). In brief, tail fibroblasts from adult
C57BL/6 mice were transduced with a lentiviral vector driving
doxycycline-inducible expression of Oct4 (Pou5f1), Sox2, Klf4,
and c-myc (Carey et al., 2009). Pluripotent cells were maintained
on mitomycin C-treated MEFs (Millipore) in medium composed
of high-glucose DMEM supplemented with L-glutamine, sodium
pyruvate, 20% fetal bovine serum (FBS), 100 nM minimum essen-
tial medium non-essential amino acids (NEAA; Gibco), 55 mM
b-mercaptoethanol (2-ME; Gibco), and 1,000 units of leukemia
inhibitory factor (Millipore). A Col2a1-GFP reporter construct
(Grant et al., 2000) was transfected into cells by nucleofection,
and a clone stably expressing the reporter upon chondrogenic in-
duction was isolated after G418 selection.
Genome Editing and Clonal Isolation
A plasmid encoding human codon optimized Streptococcus pyo-
genes Cas9 (hCas9) was obtained as a gift from George Church
(Mali et al., 2013) (Addgene plasmid #41815). To target hCas9 to
the Ccl2 locus, we generated a guide RNA targeting the start
codon of the Ccl2 coding sequence using the complementary oli-
gonucleotides sgMcp1-4_S: 50-caccGCT CTT CCT CCA CCA CCA
TGC-30 and sgMcp1-4_AS: 50-aaacGCA TGG TGG TGG AGG AAG
AGC-30, where lowercase bases were used to clone into BbsI-gener-
ated overhangs in the expression vector (Perez-Pinera et al., 2013a)
(Addgene plasmid #47108).
Targeting vectors were produced as described in Supplemental
Experimental Procedures.
iPSCs were prepared for transfection by trypsinization followed
by a 30-min feeder subtraction. Lipofectamine 2000 (Life Technol-
ogies) was used following the manufacturer’s instructions to co-
transfect 800 ng of each single guide RNA and 800 ng of hCas9
along with 1.5 mg of the appropriate targeting vector into iPSCs
freshly plated on MEFs in complete, antibiotic-free iPSC medium
in a 6-well plate. The following day, cells were subjected to selec-
tion with 100 mg/mL hygromycin B (Life Technologies), and iPSCs
were subcultured on MEFs for 2 weeks prior to clonal isolation.
Clones were isolated either by iterative mechanical picking or by
single-cell deposition by a FACSVantage sorter (Becton Dickson).
Details for this procedure, as well as clonal screening, are available
in Supplemental Experimental Procedures.
Micromass Pre-differentiation Culture
Cells were differentiated toward a mesenchymal state using a high-
density micromass culture. Cells were cultured in serum-free
1210
Stem Cell Reports j Vol. 8 j 1202–1213 j May 9, 2017
 differentiation medium consisting of high-glucose DMEM, NEAA,
2-ME, ITS+ (insulin, transferrin, selenium) pre-mix supplement
(BD), 25 ng/mL gentamicin, 50 mg/ml L-ascorbic acid-phosphate,
and 40 mg/ml L-proline. On days 3–5 only, medium was supple-
mented with 100 nM dexamethasone (Sigma) and 50 ng/mL mu-
rine BMP-4 (R&D Systems). Micromasses were dissociated on day
15 with pronase and type II collagenase to attain a single-cell sus-
pension. Dissociated cells were plated in monolayer on gelatinized
vessels and cultured in differentiation medium supplemented with
4 ng/mL basic fibroblast growth factor (Roche), and 10% FBS. Cells
were subsequently used in monolayer to probe the dynamical
response of engineered cells to IL-1 or TNF-a treatment. In addi-
tion, cells were used to derive engineered cartilage to evaluate their
utility as a source for inflammation-protected tissue regeneration.
NF-kB Activity Assay
A lentiviral NF-kB transcriptional reporter was prepared and trans-
duced into cells as described in Supplemental Experimental Pro-
cedures. Luminescence normalized to background levels of no
cytokine treatment was used to report induction of NF-kB tran-
scriptional activity.
Chondrogenesis in Aggregate Culture System
Passage 2–3 pre-differentiated cells were trypsinized and resus-
pended in differentiation medium supplemented with 100 nM
dexamethasone and 10 ng/mL TGF-b3 (R&D Systems) at a density
of 1 3 106 cells/mL. Aggregate cultures were produced by placing
cells in wells of a U-bottom 96-well plate (125,000–250,000 cells
per well, depending on the experiment) or in 15-mL conical tubes
(500,000 cells per tube). Cells were pelleted by centrifugation at
200 3 g and cultured for 3–4 weeks prior to treatment with cyto-
kine (0, 0.1–1 ng/mL IL-1a, or 20 ng/mL TNF-a) in the absence
of dexamethasone and TGF-b3. Three days later, aggregate cultures
and culture supernatant specimens were harvested for gene expres-
sion, biochemical, and histological analyses. Detailed methods for
these measurements, including ELISA processing, are provided in
Supplemental Experimental Procedures.
Statistical Analysis
Statistical analysis was performed with the Statistica 7 software
package using ANOVA with Fisher’s protected least significance dif-
ference post hoc test with a = 0.05. For qRT-PCR comparisons, fold-
change values were log-transformed prior to statistical analysis.
Average group values and SEM were calculated in the logarithmic
space prior to transforming data to linear values for reporting
fold changes.
