IMPORTANCE Prostate cancer is the second leading cause of cancer death among US men.
OBJECTIVE To systematically review evidence on prostate-specific antigen (PSA)–based
prostate cancer screening, treatments for localized prostate cancer, and prebiopsy risk
calculators to inform the US Preventive Services Task Force.
DATA SOURCES Searches of PubMed, EMBASE, Web of Science, and Cochrane Registries and
Databases from July 1, 2011, through July 15, 2017, with a surveillance search on February 1, 2018.
STUDY SELECTION English-language reports of randomized clinical trials (RCTs) of screening;
cohort studies reporting harms; RCTs and cohort studies of active localized cancer treatments
vs conservative approaches (eg, active surveillance, watchful waiting); external validations of
prebiopsy risk calculators to identify aggressive cancers.
DATA EXTRACTION AND SYNTHESIS One investigator abstracted data; a second checked
accuracy. Two investigators independently rated study quality.
MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES Prostate cancer and all-cause mortality; false-positive
screening results, biopsy complications, overdiagnosis; adverse effects of active treatments.
Random-effects meta-analyses were conducted for treatment harms.
RESULTS Sixty-three studies in 104 publications were included (N = 1 904 950).
Randomization to PSA screening was not associated with reduced risk of prostate cancer
mortality in either a US trial with substantial control group contamination (n = 76 683) or
a UK trial with low adherence to a single PSA screen (n = 408 825) but was associated with
significantly reduced prostate cancer mortality in a European trial (n = 162 243; relative risk
[RR], 0.79 [95% CI, 0.69-0.91]; absolute risk reduction, 1.1 deaths per 10 000 person-years
[95% CI, 0.5-1.8]). Of 61 604 men screened in the European trial, 17.8% received
false-positive results. In 3 cohorts (n = 15 136), complications requiring hospitalization
occurred in 0.5% to 1.6% of men undergoing biopsy after abnormal screening findings.
Overdiagnosis was estimated to occur in 20.7% to 50.4% of screen-detected cancers. In an
RCT of men with screen-detected prostate cancer (n = 1643), neither radical prostatectomy
(hazard ratio [HR], 0.63 [95% CI, 0.21-1.93]) nor radiation therapy (HR, 0.51 [95% CI,
0.15-1.69]) were associated with significantly reduced prostate cancer mortality vs active
monitoring, although each was associated with significantly lower risk of metastatic disease.
Relative to conservative management, radical prostatectomy was associated with increased
risk of urinary incontinence (pooled RR, 2.27 [95% CI, 1.82-2.84]; 3 trials; n = 1796) and
erectile dysfunction (pooled RR, 1.82 [95% CI, 1.62-2.04]; 2 trials; n = 883). Relative to
conservative management (8 cohort studies; n = 3066), radiation therapy was associated
with increased risk of erectile dysfunction (pooled RR, 1.31 [95% CI, 1.20-1.42]).
CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE PSA screening may reduce prostate cancer mortality risk but
is associated with false-positive results, biopsy complications, and overdiagnosis. Compared
with conservative approaches, active treatments for screen-detected prostate cancer have
unclear effects on long-term survival but are associated with sexual and urinary difficulties.

 P
rostate cancer is the most commonly diagnosed can-
cer in US men and the second leading cause of cancer
death.1 It has been estimated that in 2018, approximately
165 000 US men will be diagnosed with prostate cancer and
29 000 men will die of prostate cancer.2 Prostate cancer incidence
is 74% greater among African American than white men1 and is also
relatively greater in men with vs men without a family history of
prostate cancer.3
US prostate cancer incidence increased sharply with the dis-
semination of prostate-specific antigen (PSA)–based screening
beginning in the late 1980s.4 In 2012, the US Preventive Services
Task Force (USPSTF) recommended against PSA-based screening
for prostate cancer, concluding that there was moderate certainty
that the benefits of screening do not outweigh the harms (D rec-
ommendation). New evidence has since emerged from screening
and treatment trials, and among US men prostate cancer is increas-
ingly managed with active surveillance, in which treatment is
deferred indefinitely unless evidence of progression is found during
periodic physical examination, PSA–based testing, or repeat biopsy.
This systematic review of screening and treatment benefits and
harms and whether prebiopsy risk calculators can reliably detect
higher-risk prostate cancers, along with a review of decision model-
ing studies,5 was conducted to inform the USPSTF in its update of
the 2012 recommendation regarding PSA-based screening for
prostate cancer.

Data Sources and Searches
MEDLINE, PubMed, EMBASE, and the Cochrane Central Register
of Controlled Trials were searched to locate studies informing
the key questions (eMethods in the Supplement) that were pub-
lished since the end of the search periods for the 2011 USPSTF
reviews7,8 (July 1, 2011, through July 15, 2017). Database searches
were supplemented with expert suggestions and by reviewing
reference lists from relevant systematic reviews and prior USPSTF
reports. KQ5, on prebiopsy risk calculators, was new to this
review; a preliminary search revealed that the earliest article in
this field was published in 2006, so databases were searched
from January 1, 2006, through October 6, 2016, for KQ5. Since
October 2016, ongoing surveillance continued through article
alerts and targeted searches of high-impact journals to identify
studies published that could affect the conclusions or the related
USPSTF recommendation. The last surveillance search was con-
ducted in February 2018; during ongoing surveillance, we identi-
fied extended follow-up from a treatment trial,9 2 cohort studies
reporting longitudinal treatment outcomes,10,11 and 3 studies of
multivariable risk calculators.12-14 We also included a recently pub-
lished large screening trial.15
Study Selection
For KQ1, randomized clinical trials (RCTs) of asymptomatic men
undergoing PSA screening vs no screening were included that
assessed cancer incidence, prostate cancer–related morbidity,
prostate cancer–specific mortality, or all-cause mortality. For KQ2,
RCTs and cohort studies of asymptomatic men undergoing PSA
screening or prostate biopsy after abnormal screening results were
included that assessed the frequency of false-positive PSA screen-
ing, physical or psychological harms of screening or biopsy, or
health-related quality of life. As has been performed for breast and
lung cancer screening,16-19 extra-incidence data from trials were
used to estimate the percentage of men diagnosed with cancer in
the screening groups who were overdiagnosed. In the absence of
overdiagnosis, the number of cases in the control group of a
screening trial would be expected to eventually catch up with the
number of cases diagnosed in the screening group; therefore, an
excess of cases in the screening group with extended follow-up
implies overdiagnosis.
For KQ3 and KQ4, RCTs and comparative cohort studies of
men with localized prostate cancer (stages T1-T2) were included
that reported prostate cancer–specific morbidity or mortality, all-
cause mortality (KQ3), or physical or psychological harms of treat-
ment, including adverse quality-of-life effects (KQ4). Studies
were required to compare outcomes among men receiving active
treatments (including radical prostatectomy, radiation therapy,
androgen deprivation therapy, cryotherapy, or high-intensity
focused ultrasound) and men receiving conservative manage-
ment (ie, watchful waiting, active surveillance, observation, or no
treatment). Because few studies were found for treatments other
than radical prostatectomy and radiation therapy, only findings
for radical prostatectomy and radiation therapy are summarized
in this article; evidence on other treatment modalities is reviewed
in the full evidence report. For KQ4 (treatment harms), uncon-
trolled observational studies with sample sizes of at least 100
men were also included.
For KQ5, external validation studies of multivariable risk cal-
culators were included if they predicted the presence of “signifi-
cant”prostate cancer using PSA testing in addition to patient vari-
ables routinely available before prostate biopsy (eg, patient
characteristics, rectal examination results, PSA level). Significant
prostate cancers were defined as either high grade (Gleason score
�7) or clinical stage T2b or higher. Studies of novel serum bio-
markers or imaging studies were excluded because results from
these studies would not be routinely available before biopsy in
most urology practices.
Data Extraction and Quality Assessment
Two reviewers independently appraised the quality of included
articles using predefined criteria,6,20-23 with disagreements
resolved by consensus or consultation with a third investigator.
One reviewer extracted study-level data into standardized evi-
dence tables; a second checked data accuracy. Included studies

 were limited to those published in English and were rated as fair or
good quality using USPSTF quality rating standards (eTable 1 in the
Supplement). Poor-quality studies contained a fatal flaw or multiple
significant limitations that could invalidate the results. Three poor-
quality RCTs of screening PSA were excluded.24-26 Limitations of
these studies included inadequate statistical power,24-26 faulty
analysis,25 and potentially biased outcomes assessment.24-26
Data Synthesis and Analysis
For each key question, the study designs, population characteris-
tics, screening and treatment details, and overall results were
summarized using descriptive statistics. Pooled meta-analyses
were not performed for outcomes of screening effectiveness
(KQ1), screening harms (KQ2), or treatment effectiveness (KQ3),
because data on these outcomes derived from few studies with
variable populations and interventions. For KQ4, random-effects
meta-analyses were performed using the method of DerSimonian
and Laird to estimate pooled relative risks (RRs) of urinary incon-
tinence (ie, daily use of a pad or worse) and erectile dysfunc-
tion (ie, erections insufficient for intercourse) among patients
receiving radical prostatectomy or radiation therapy vs conserva-
tive management.
Statistical heterogeneity across studies was estimated
using the I2 statistic. Meta-analyses were performed using Stata
version 14.2 (StataCorp). Pooled RRs were used to estimate the
number of patients needed to be treated for 1 patient to be
harmed (number needed to harm); in these calculations, the abso-
lute risk of the harm in actively treated patients was estimated as

Key questions
1
Is there direct evidence that prostate cancer–specific antigen (PSA)–based screening for prostate cancer reduces short- or long-term prostate cancer
morbidity and mortality and all-cause mortality?
a. Does the effectiveness of PSA-based screening vary by subpopulation or risk factor (eg, age, race/ethnicity, family history, or clinical risk assessment)?
5
Is there evidence that use of a prebiopsy prostate cancer risk calculator, in combination with PSA–based screening, accurately identifies men with clinically
significant prostate cancer (ie, cancer that is more likely to cause symptoms or lead to advanced disease), compared with PSA-based screening alone?
3
Is there evidence that various treatment approaches for early-stage or screen-detected prostate cancer reduce morbidity and mortality?
a. Does the effectiveness of these treatment approaches vary by subpopulation or risk factor (eg, age, race/ethnicity, baseline PSA value, family
history, comorbid conditions, or clinical risk assessment)?
2
What are the harms of PSA-based screening for prostate cancer and diagnostic follow-up?
a. Do the harms of PSA-based screening for prostate cancer and diagnostic follow-up vary by subpopulation or risk factor (eg, age, race/ethnicity,
family history, or clinical risk assessment)?
4
What are the harms of the various treatment approaches for early-stage or screen-detected prostate cancer?
a. Do the harms of these treatment approaches vary by subpopulation or risk factor (eg, age, race/ethnicity, baseline PSA value, family history,
comorbid conditions, or clinical risk assessment)?
b. Do the harms differ by treatment approach? 
Evidence reviews for the US Preventive Services Task Force (USPSTF) use
an analytic framework to visually display the key questions that the review
will address to allow the USPSTF to evaluate the effectiveness and safety of
a preventive service. The questions are depicted by linkages that relate
interventions and outcomes. Refer to the USPSTF Procedure Manual for
further details.6

cating statistical significance.
Results
Two reviewers independently assessed 4105 unique citations
and 303 full-text articles for inclusion (Figure 2). Overall, 24 ar-
ticles (3 studies) were included for KQ1, 15 articles (8 studies)
were included for KQ2, 23 articles (13 studies) were included for
KQ3, 38 articles (31 studies) were included for KQ4, and 14 articles
(14 studies) were included for KQ5.

In the PLCO trial, 76 683 US men aged 55 to 74 years were re-
cruited from 1993 to 2001 and randomized to either annual PSA
screening for 6 years or usual care. When men had PSA levels of
4.0 ng/mL or greater, they and their clinicians were informed; com-
munity physicians coordinated diagnostic evaluations and treat-
ments. The PLCO trial has been characterized as comparing the ef-

144),26menintheERSPCtrial(95%CI,24-29),and154meninthe
CAPtrial(95%CI,128-192)for1additionalmantobediagnosedwith
prostate cancer.15,30,39
Cumulative Incidence of Metastatic Disease
Within 4 ERSPC sites, the cumulative incidence of metastatic can-
cer (ie, metastases on imaging or a PSA level >100 ng/mL) at a me-
dian follow-up of 12.0 years was lower among men randomized to
screeningcomparedwithcontrol(RR,0.70[95%CI,0.60to0.82]),
andrandomizationtoscreeningwasassociatedwithanabsolutere-
duction in long-term risk of metastatic prostate cancer of 3.1 cases
per 1000 men.43 After accounting for the 55.6% relative increase
in prostate cancer incidence in the screening vs control groups at
these sites, the number needed to invite to avoid 1 case of meta-
static cancer was 323 (95% CI, 227-556), and the number needed
to diagnose with prostate cancer through screening to avert 1 case
of metastatic cancer was 12 (95% CI, 9-21).43
Prostate Cancer Mortality
At a median follow-up of 14.8 years in the PLCO trial, the prostate
cancer–specific mortality rate was 4.8 per 10 000 person-years
among men in the intervention group and 4.6 per 10 000 person-
years among men in the control group (RR, 1.04 [95% CI, 0.87-
1.24]) (Table 1).29 In the CAP trial, at a median follow-up of 10
years, prostate cancer–specific mortality was 3.0 per 10 000
person-years among men invited to screening and 3.1 per 10 000
person-years among men in the control group (RR, 0.96 [95% CI,
0.85-1.08]). Among men in the ERSPC core age group after a
median of 13 years of follow-up, prostate cancer–specific mortality
was 4.3 per 10 000 person-years in the intervention group and 5.4
per 10 000 person-years in control group (RR, 0.79 [95% CI,
0.69-0.91]; P = .001).30 In the ERSPC trial, the absolute risk reduc-
tion in prostate cancer mortality associated with screening was 1.1
deaths per 10 000 person-years (95% CI, 0.5-1.8), or 1.3 fewer
prostate cancer deaths per 1000 men; the number needed to
invite to prevent 1 prostate cancer death was 781 (95% CI, 490-
1929), and the number needed to diagnose was 27 (95% CI,
17-66). Across all ERSPC sites, prostate cancer mortality was statis-
tically significantly reduced only at the sites in the Netherlands
and Sweden, although point estimates were in favor of screening
at all sites except Switzerland.
Randomization to screening was not associated with statisti-
cally significant reductions in prostate cancer mortality among
men aged 65 to 74 years at baseline in the PLCO trial (RR, 1.02
[95% CI, 0.77-1.37])29 or among men aged 70 to 74 years at base-
line in the ERSPC trial (RR, 1.17 [95% CI, 0.82-1.66]).30 No reports
on differences in outcomes by race/ethnicity within the PLCO or
ERSPC trials were found, and the sample size of 3370 non-Hispanic
black men randomized in the PLCO trial (4.4% of the overall
population) was relatively small. Among white men in the PLCO
trial who reported of a family history of prostate cancer (n = 4833),
the multivariable-adjusted hazard ratio for prostate cancer death
among men randomized to screening was lower relative to control
participants but was not statistically significant (HR, 0.49 [95% CI,
0.22-1.10]).44
All-Cause Mortality
Aftermedianfollow-upperiodsrangingfrom10yearsintheCAPtrial
to 14.8 years in the PLCO trial, randomization to screening (relative
to control) was not associated with statistically significantly re-
duced all-cause mortality in any of the 3 trials (CAP trial: RR, 0.99
[95%CI,0.94-1.03];ERSPCtrial:RR,1.00[95%CI,0.98-1.02];PLCO
trial: RR, 0.98 [95% CI, 0.95-1.00]) (Table 1).15,29,30
Harms of Screening
KeyQuestion2.WhataretheharmsofPSA-basedscreeningforpros-
tate cancer and diagnostic follow-up?
Evidence on the harms of PSA screening and diag-
nostic follow-up derives from the PLCO, CAP, and ERSPC trials
(n = 647 906), as well as 2 good-quality and 3 fair-quality cohort
studies (n = 297 971).15,27,29,30,45-55
False-Positive Testing and Diagnostic Biopsies
Among men who underwent at least 1 PSA screen during the initial
4 (of 6) PLCO screening rounds (n = 32 576), 10.4% received at
least 1 false-positive PSA screening result,56 compared with 17.8%
of men who were screened at least once within 5 ERSPC centers
(n = 61 604).50 Across all PLCO screening rounds, 12.6% of men
randomized to screening underwent 1 or more biopsies, resulting in
a total of 6295 biopsies (16.4 biopsies per 100 men randomized to
screening). Within ERSPC, the rate of biopsies among men ran-
domized to screening was higher (27.7 biopsies per 100 men). Of
biopsies performed in the 3 trials, 67.7%, 75.8%, and 60.6% did
not result in a prostate cancer diagnosis in the PLCO, ERSPC, and
CAP trials, respectively.15,30,52
Among men undergoing a single round of PSA screening
within the Veterans Affairs health system (n = 295 645), 8.5%
had a PSA level of 4 ng/mL or greater; of these, 32.9% underwent

 subsequent prostate biopsy.55 Of biopsies performed, 37.2% did
not result in a prostate cancer diagnosis.
Physical and Psychological Harms of Screening
and Diagnostic Follow-up
Among men who underwent biopsy in the PLCO trial (n = 4861),
2.0% experienced complications consisting predominately of in-
fection,bleeding,orurinarydifficulties,while5.6%of8313menun-
dergoing biopsy experienced similar complications in the Veterans
Affairscohort.55AmongmenundergoingbiopsyafterabnormalPSA
screening results, postbiopsy hospitalization ranged from 0.5% to
1.6% in 1 trial and 2 cohorts.53,55,57 Within approximately 1 month
of biopsy within a UK cohort (n = 1147),53 7.3% of men experienced
moderate or serious pain and 5.5% experienced moderate or se-
vere fevers. Prostate biopsy has not been associated with statisti-
cally significantly increased risk of death.47,52,53 Within 3 cohorts
(n = 1179),46,48,49,51 men who had abnormal PSA screening results
followed by normal biopsy results had increased prostate cancer–
specific worry up to 1 year after biopsy but no increase in depres-
sion or trait anxiety.
Overdiagnosis
The percentage of detected cancers that were overdiagnosed was
estimated using the excess incidence method applied to screening
trials data (eTable 2 in the Supplement).18 When overdiagnosis was
estimated as a percentage of all prostate cancers diagnosed, 16.4%
of prostate cancers were overdiagnosed in the PLCO trial, 33.2% in
theERSPCtrial,and40.7%intheCAPtrial.Whenestimatedasaper-
centageofcancersdetectedbyscreeningduringthe2trialsreport-
ing such data, 20.7% of cancers were overdiagnosed in the PLCO
trial and 50.4% in the ERSPC trial. The extent of overdiagnosis var-
ied across ERSPC sites, with higher rates of overdiagnosis occur-
ring at 2 sites that also reported statistically significantly reduced
prostate cancer mortality with screening.33,35
Benefits of Early Detection
Key Question 3. Is there evidence that various treatment ap-
proaches for early-stage or screen-detected prostate cancer re-
duce morbidity and mortality?
Three RCTs (n = 2524)9,58,59 and 7 cohort studies
(n = 64 965)11,60-65 assessed morbidity and mortality with radical
prostatectomycomparedwithconservativemanagement,and1RCT

diation therapy with conservative management (Table 2). Conser-

The ProtecT trial randomized men with localized, screen-
detectedprostatecancertoradicalprostatectomy,radiationtherapy
(withneoadjuvantandrogendeprivationtherapy),oractivesurveil-
lance (consisting of periodic PSA monitoring without surveillance
biopsy).58Duringamedianfollow-upof10years,54.8%ofmenran-
domized to active surveillance received treatment, mostly com-
monlyradicalprostatectomy;prostatecancersurvivalwasapproxi-
mately99%ineachgroup,withnostatisticallysignificantdifferences
in prostate cancer mortality or all-cause mortality.
In the Scandinavian Prostate Cancer Group Trial-4 (SPCG-4),
which included men with clinically diagnosed, predominately
palpable cancers, radical prostatectomy was associated with
statistically significantly reduced prostate cancer mortality (RR,
0.56 [95% CI, 0.41-0.77]) and all-cause mortality (RR, 0.71 [95% CI,
0.59-0.86]), compared with watchful waiting.59 In the US Prostate
Cancer Intervention vs Observation Trial (PIVOT), in which 50%
of men had screen-detected rather than clinically detected can-
cers, radical prostatectomy did not significantly reduce either pros-
tate cancer mortality (RR, 0.65 [95% CI, 0.41-1.03]) or all-cause
mortality (RR, 0.92 [95% CI, 0.82-1.02]), compared with conserva-
tive management.9
IntheProtecTtrial,incidenceofmetastaticdiseaseamongmen
randomized to active surveillance (6.3 cases per 1000 person-
years) was higher than among men randomized to radical prosta-
tectomy or radiation therapy (2.4 and 3.0 cases per 1000 person-
years;P = .004foroveralldifferenceacrossgroups).Approximately
27 (95% CI, 16-77) and 32 (95% CI, 18-143) men with screen-
detectedlocalizedcancerwouldneedtobetreatedwithradicalpros-
tatectomy and radiation therapy (rather than active surveillance),
respectively, to prevent 1 man from progressing to metastatic dis-
ease within 10 years. In both the SPCG-4 and PIVOT trials, radical
prostatectomy was also associated with reduced progression to
metastatic or systemic disease (SPCG-4: RR, 0.57 [95% CI, 0.44-
0.75]; PIVOT: HR, 0.64 [95% CI, 0.42-0.97]).9,59
Compared with conservative management, radical prostatec-
tomy and radiation therapy were associated with reduced prostate
cancer mortality and all-cause mortality in several fair- to good-
quality cohort studies (Table 2).60-65 However, cohort study esti-
mates often diverged from RCT estimates, and cohort studies of
treatments may be susceptible to residual confounding.
Harms of Treatment
Key Question 4. What are the harms of the various treatment ap-
proaches for early-stage or screen-detected prostate cancer?
Three RCTs (n = 2524)66-68 and 11 cohort studies
(n = 8809)10,11,69-78comparedharmsamongmentreatedwithradi-
cal prostatectomy compared with conservative management, and
6 uncontrolled studies of surgical harms related to radical prosta-
tectomy were included.79-84 Two RCTs (n = 1198)66,67,85 and 12 co-
hort studies (n = 4762)10,11,69-78,86 compared harms among men
treated with radiation therapy compared with conservative man-
agement,and1uncontrolledobservationalstudyofradiationtherapy
was included (n = 3180).87
Both urinary incontinence and erectile dysfunction occurred
more commonly in men who underwent radical prostatectomy
than in men receiving conservative management (Figure 3 and
Figure 4). Pooled relative risks of incontinence with radical
prostatectomy were 2.27 (95% CI, 1.82-2.84; I2 = 0.0%) in 3 RCTs
and 2.75 (95% CI, 1.78-4.23; I2 = 63.0%) in 6 cohort studies.
Based on risk differences estimated from RCT data, 7.9 men (95%
CI, 5.4-12.2) would need to be treated with radical prostatectomy
rather than conservative management for 1 additional man to
develop incontinence.
In pooled meta-analyses of the 3 RCTs, there was marked sta-
tistical heterogeneity in the relative risk of erectile dysfunction
with radical prostatectomy (I2 = 87.5%), which was attributable to
a disparate outcome from the ProtecT trial, in which many men

meta-analysis, the pooled relative risk of erectile dysfunction
associated with radical prostatectomy vs conservative manage-

a Conservative management encompasses management strategies in which
active treatment is deferred or postponed indefinitely (ie, active surveillance,
watchful waiting, or no treatment).
bData from Donovan et al66 are the source of marked heterogeneity, potentially
because of the crossover of many active surveillance patients to radical
treatments during the 6 years of median follow-up. Excluding those data and
pooling only data from Wilt et al68 and Johansson et al88 results in RR = 1.82

 In5longitudinalstudies,9-11,66,77meanurinaryandsexualfunc-
tion scores decreased to a nadir in the initial year after radical pros-
tatectomy with some longer-term improvement, although urinary
andsexualfunctiontypicallyremainedstatisticallysignificantlylower
than baseline up to 6 years after the procedure.
Data on surgical complications and perioperative mortality
associated with radical prostatectomy are summarized in eTable 3
in the Supplement. In a cohort of US men undergoing radical
prostatectomy, 1.7% experienced major medical complications
(most commonly cardiac or pulmonary) and 5.3% experienced
major surgical complications (requiring reintervention) within 30
days of surgery.82 Across 2 trials and 6 cohort studies, the median
perioperative mortality with radical prostatectomy was 0.29%
(range, 0.0%-0.52%).
There was marked variability across 8 studies compar-
ing incidence of urinary incontinence with radiation and conserva-
tive management, so these were not meta-analyzed (Figure 5).
In the ProtecT trial, the prevalence of erectile dysfunction at
6 years of median follow-up was similar among men randomized
to radiation therapy vs active surveillance (39.8% vs 36.2%;
RR, 0.91 [95% CI, 0.77-1.08]), likely attributable to the substan-
tial crossover to radical treatment of men randomized to active
surveillance.66 In contrast, in 8 cohort studies, the prevalence
of erectile dysfunction was more common in men treated with
radiation therapy compared with men receiving conservative
management (pooled RR, 1.31 [95% CI, 1.20-1.42]; I2 = 22.1%)
(Figure 6).10,11,69,73,75-77,86 Based on the cohort data, 6.9 men
(95% CI, 5.1-10.7) would need to be treated with radiation therapy
rather than conservative management for 1 additional man to
develop erectile dysfunction. Although 2 US studies observed
longitudinal improvement in adverse effects of radiation therapy
on sexual function,10,11 initial decrements in sexual function
associated with radiation therapy persisted throughout a 3-year
follow-up period in an Australian cohort.77
In the ProtecT trial, 10.4% of men randomized to radiation
therapy experienced bothersome bowel symptoms (eg, loose
stools, fecal incontinence) at 6-month follow-up, which tended to
diminish during the 6-year follow-up.66 Two US cohort studies
suggest a similar pattern,10,11 in contrast to an Australian cohort
study in which adverse bowel effects of radiation therapy per-
sisted during 3 years of follow-up.77
In 3 trials comparing radical prostatectomy with conservative
management,9,66,88 randomization to radical prostatectomy was
not associated with differences in anxiety, depression, or physical
or mental health status. Cohort studies11,70-72,74,75,77,78 also found
no evidence of an adverse effect of radical prostatectomy on
generic quality-of-life measures compared with conservative man-
agement. Similarly, 2 trials66,67 and 9 cohort studies11,70-73,75,77,78,86
suggest no substantive adverse effect of radiation therapy on gen-
eral measures of physical, mental, or global health status compared
with conservative management.
Accuracy of Risk Calculators
Key Question 5. Is there evidence that use of a prebiopsy prostate
cancerriskcalculator,incombinationwithPSA-basedscreening,ac-
curatelyidentifiesmenwithclinicallysignificantprostatecancercom-
pared with PSA-based screening alone?
Fourteen articles (n = 48 234)12-14,89-99 provided evidence on
discrimination or calibration of risk assessment tools for predic-
tion of clinically significant prostate cancer (either Gleason score
�7 or Stage 2b or higher) among men undergoing prostate
biopsy (Table 3). All were external validation studies of either
the Prostate Cancer Prevention Trial (PCPT) risk calculator or the
ERSPC risk calculator. Most cohorts consisted of men referred to
tertiary or academic centers and typically included both sympto-
matic men and asymptomatic men with abnormal screening
results. No RCTs evaluated the clinical effect of risk calculator use
on patient outcomes.

Discussion
Table 3 summarizes the evidence contained in this review. Direct
evidence from 3 fair-quality trials demonstrates that PSA screen-
ing increases prostate cancer detection, especially of localized,
less aggressive cancers,30,39 and evidence from 4 ERSPC sites sug-
gests that screening can reduce the long-term incidence of meta-
static disease.43 While the PLCO and CAP trials found no associa-
tion between randomization to screening invitation and reduced
prostate cancer mortality, the overall ERSPC trial found a relative
risk of 0.79 for prostate cancer mortality with screening.30 Differ-
ences in trial outcomes may have been attributable to greater
baseline exposure to PSA testing and contamination in the PLCO
trial, low adherence to invitation to a single PSA screen in the CAP
trial, and higher adherence to screening and biopsy in the ERSPC
trial. A recent analysis of individual patient data from both the
PLCO and the ERSPC trials suggests that results from both trials
are consistent with approximately 25% to 30% relative reduction
in the risk of prostate cancer death with screening vs no screening
after accounting for differences in baseline risk, screening adher-
ence, contamination, and the intensity of postscreening diagnostic
evaluation.100 In the ERSPC trial, 27 men needed to be diagnosed
(and potentially treated) to prevent 1 prostate cancer death,
underscoring the potential for overdiagnosis and overtreatment
with PSA screening.30 Evidence is limited on the benefit of screen-
ing among men older than 70 years or the differential benefits
among African American men or men with a family history of pros-
tate cancer.
Trial data demonstrate that abnormal PSA screening test
results are common and that most men referred for biopsy after
abnormal screening results will not have prostate cancer.15,30,52
Biopsy harms include pain, bleeding, and infection,53 but perhaps
the most serious harm of prostate cancer screening is overdiagno-
sis, because overdiagnosis burdens men with the potential harms
of diagnosis and treatment without improving life expectancy or
quality of life. It was estimated that 16.4% to 50.4% of prostate
cancers were overdiagnosed during the 3 trials, consistent with
estimates based on ecological or modeling studies.4,101-104
This review assessed both the immediate harms of screening
as well as the consequent adverse effects of prostate cancer treat-
ments. Most men undergoing radical prostatectomy will experi-
ence long-term sexual difficulties and approximately 17% will expe-
rience urinary difficulties, while approximately 36% of men
receiving radiation therapy experience erectile problems and many
will experience adverse bowel symptoms.66 Nevertheless, com-
pared with conservative management, active treatments for local-
ized prostate cancer did not clearly compromise overall quality of
life or global physical or mental health status, despite adverse
sexual, urinary, and bowel effects.11,66,70-72,74,75,77,86
The ProtecT trial found similarly high prostate cancer survival
amongmenwithscreen-detected,early-stageprostatecancerran-
domized to radical prostatectomy, radiation therapy, or active sur-
veillance. Of men assigned to active surveillance, 45.2% remained
under surveillance without receiving active treatment during the
10-year follow-up period, although an increase in the incidence of
metastatic disease was observed in the active surveillance group
(approximately 6% with active surveillance vs 2 to 3% with active
treatment). In contrast to the ProtecT active surveillance protocol

date whether the use of adjunctive tests can improve the balance
of benefits and harms of PSA-based prostate cancer screening in
community settings.

may also exaggerate estimates of overdiagnosis based on extra in-
cidence, although estimates based on longer-term follow-up may
be influenced by posttrial PSA testing. In the PLCO trial, contami-
nationamongcontrolgroupparticipantswouldbeexpectedtobias
trial results toward the null. The ERSPC trial, in contrast, was lim-
ited by unexplained stage-adjusted differences in prostate cancer
treatments by study group that may have biased results in favor of
screening.107TherewasalsovariationacrossERSPCsitesinrecruit-
mentmethods,screeningintervals,useofancillarytesting,andPSA
thresholds for biopsy referral. The CAP trial was limited by the low
adherence of intervention participants to the invitation to a single
PSAscreen.Acrossallstudies,relativelyfewmenolderthan70years
were enrolled, and there is limited evidence about the differential
benefits or harms of screening for men at higher risk.

Limitations
This review may be limited by language or publication biases.
Asidefromuncontrolledstudiesoftreatmentharms,fewornostud-
ies were found on comparative effectiveness of new or novel treat-
mentmodalities,suchasalternativesurgicalapproaches(eg,nerve-
sparing or robotic surgery), cryotherapy, or high-intensity focused
ultrasound. Because of the limited use and variable definitions
of active surveillance during the time periods of most included
studies, active surveillance and watchful waiting were grouped in
analyses, although outcomes may differ between these conserva-
tive approaches.
Conclusions
PSA screening may reduce prostate cancer mortality risk but is
associated with false-positive results, biopsy complications, and
overdiagnosis. Compared with conservative approaches, active
treatments for screen-detected prostate cancer have unclear
effects on long-term survival but are associated with sexual and
urinary difficulties.
