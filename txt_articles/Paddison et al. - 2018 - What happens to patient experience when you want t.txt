Objectives To examine patient consultation preferences 
for seeing or speaking to a general practitioner (GP) or 
nurse; to estimate associations between patient-reported 
experiences and the type of consultation patients actually 
received (phone or face-to-face, GP or nurse).
Design Secondary analysis of data from the 2013 to 2014 
General Practice Patient Survey.
setting and participants 870 085 patients from 8005 
English general practices.
Outcomes Patient ratings of communication and ‘trust 
and confidence’ with the clinician they saw.
results 77.7% of patients reported wanting to see or 
speak to a GP, while 14.5% reported asking to see or 
speak to a nurse the last time they tried to make an 
appointment (weighted percentages). Being unable to see 
or speak to the practitioner type of the patients’ choice 
was associated with lower ratings of trust and confidence 
and patient-rated communication. Smaller differences 
were found if patients wanted a face-to-face consultation 
and received a phone consultation instead. The greatest 
difference was for patients who asked to see a GP and 
instead spoke to a nurse for whom the adjusted mean 
difference in confidence and trust compared with those 
who wanted to see a nurse and did see a nurse was −15.8 
points (95% CI −17.6 to −14.0) for confidence and trust in 
the practitioner and −10.5 points (95% CI −11.7 to −9.3) 
for net communication score, both on a 0–100 scale.
Conclusions Patients’ evaluation of their care is worse if 
they do not receive the type of consultation they expect, 
especially if they prefer a doctor but are unable to see 
one. New models of care should consider the potential 
unintended consequences for patient experience of the 
widespread introduction of multidisciplinary teams in 
general practice.
IntrODuCtIOn
Patient experience is a core dimension of 
healthcare quality1 and measuring patient 
experience enables the views of service 
users to be incorporated into the evalua-
tion and improvement of health services at 
local and national level.2 3 In the UK, 90% 
of all National Health Service (NHS) patient 
contacts occur in primary care. Though 
primary care is highly valued by the UK 
public, the primary care workforce is under 
unprecedented strain4 5 and clear policies for 
reforming primary care in England are now 
emerging.6 7 These include the development 
of wider multidisciplinary teams that make 
greater use of nurses, physicians’ associates, 
pharmacists and administrative support. It is 
anticipated that an expanded workforce will 
free up clinical time for doctors, enabling 
them to devote more time to the delivery of 
care for complex patients and spend less time 
on administration and minor health issues.7 
At present it is unclear what impact these 
proposed changes to the primary care work-
force might have on patient choice and 
quality of care, including patient experi-
ence. Multidisciplinary teams could increase 
patient choice by improving access to nurses 
and pharmacists, but their introduction 
could also have unintended adverse impacts, 
for example, on patients who were no longer 
able to see the type of clinician of their choice.
strengths and limitations of this study
 
► Large national survey with respondents including 
870 085 patients from 8005 English general 
practices.
 
► Appointment choice (mode and type of practitioner), 
and patient-reported experience, all collected in a 
single survey.
 
► Thirty-four per cent response rate, though typical for 
similar national surveys.
 
► Patient-reported confidence and trust assessed 
using a single item within the General Practice 
Patient Survey.

Open Access 
Given the policy emphasis on promoting patient 
choice, evidence is needed on the acceptability to 
patients of seeing different practitioners, especially when 
their original intention had been to see a general prac-
titioner (GP). Systematic reviews suggest that nurse–GP 
substitution in primary care can produce similar or better 
quality of care and high levels of patient satisfaction,8 9 
but there is also evidence that some patients do not want 
nurses to substitute for GPs.10 Relational continuity of 
care, together with perceived trust and confidence, have 
emerged as important factors in understanding why some 
patients may prefer to see a GP and, more specifically, a 
GP who knows them well.11
In this primary care-based study, we examine patient 
consultation preferences and their association with 
patient-reported experiences, using data from the English 
General Practice Patient Survey (GPPS) to address the 
following questions:
1. To what extent do patients in primary care request an 
appointment with a doctor or a nurse, and how often 
is this request met?
2. When patients are unable to get an appointment of 
their choice (phone or face-to-face, GP or nurse), is 
this associated with poorer patient-reported commu-
nication or lower trust and confidence?
MethODs
We analysed data from the 2013–2014 GPPS (http://www. 
gp- 
patient. 
co. 
uk), which is sent as a mail questionnaire to 
2.6 million patients in England each year.12 We estimated 
preference for nurse and GP appointments from the 
question which asked respondents ‘Last time you wanted 
to see or speak to a GP or nurse from your GP surgery: 
what did you want to do?’ with response options coded 
into five categories (see online supplementary appendix 
table 1):
 
► See or speak to a GP.
 
► See or speak to a nurse.
 
► A home visit
 
► Was not sure or did not mind.
 
► Wanted more than one of the previous four categories.
Practice population estimates were computed using 
survey weights that account for survey design and non-re-
sponse.13 Variation in preferences for GP and nurse 
appointments were explored using crude and adjusted 
logistic regression using a binary classification (wanting 
to see or speak to a nurse vs wanting to see or speak to a 
GP as the outcome—see online supplementary appendix 
table 2 for detail of how categories were constructed), 
excluding those indifferent as to whether they saw a 
doctor or a nurse. Fixed effects included in the models 
were patient-reported age, gender, ethnicity, confidence 
in managing their own health and presence of a long-
term condition, as well as a measure of social deprivation 
based on the patient’s postal code of residence (national 
quintiles as categories). General practice was included as 
a random effect (intercept). All analyses were restricted 
to patients with complete information on all variables 
included in the adjusted model.
Next, we investigated whether people who did not get 
an appointment with the type of practitioner of their 
choice were more likely to report poorer patient expe-
rience. For simplicity this analysis was restricted to those 
who only endorsed one response option each for the 
question on what type of appointment they had requested 
and for the question on what they got. Sixteen categories, 
combinations of seeing or speaking to a health profes-
sional and whether the appointment was with a GP or 
a nurse, were created. The dataset was then split into 
those whose last appointment was with a GP and those 
whose last appointment was with a nurse, and these were 
modelled separately.
Two series of regression models were run. The first 
series of models used responses to the question ‘Did you 
have confidence and trust in the GP (nurse) you saw or 
spoke to?’ as the outcome. Response options were: ‘yes, 
definitely’; ‘yes, to some extent’ and ‘no, not at all’ which 
were scored as 100, 50 and 0, respectively. Crude differ-
ences between the categories were estimated for trust and 
confidence in GPs and, separately, for nurses, using linear 
regression. Mixed-effect linear regression was then used 
for an adjusted analysis, including age, gender, ethnicity, 
confidence in managing their own health, the presence 
of a long-standing heath condition and deprivation. Prac-
tice was included as a random effect (intercept), and 
analyses were restricted to those who had complete infor-
mation on all sociodemographic and health variables in 
this study.
A second series of models using the same approach 
(linear regressions to estimate crude differences between 
categories, and mixed-effect linear regression for anal-
yses adjusting for health and demographic characteris-
tics and additionally controlling for practice) were then 
run using composite patient-rated communication scores 
as the outcome. This composite score was the mean of 
all responses to five questions on patient-reported expe-
riences of communication for patients who answered 
at least three of these questions. Scores were computed 
separately for doctor communication (five items) and 
nurse communication (five items). The questions asked 
how good the GP or nurse was at ‘giving you enough 
time’, ‘listening to you’ or ‘explaining tests and treat-
ments’, ‘involving you in decisions about your care' and 
‘treating you with care and concern’. As in our previous 
work, responses to these patient experience items were 
linearly rescaled to give a score from 0 to 100 in order to 
facilitate comparison between items.14 15
results
Among 870 085 primary care patients from 8005 practices 
in England, more than three-quarters reported that they 
only asked to see or speak to a GP, while just under 15% 
only asked to see or speak to a nurse (table 1) with the 
remainder wanting a home visit, expressing no preference

or asking for multiple types of appointment. Comparing 
the type of appointment patients wanted and the type of 
appointment they actually received, we found that the 
great majority of people got what they wanted. As shown 
in table 1, 96% of people who wanted to see or speak to 
a GP achieved this, compared with 92% of people who 
wanted to see or speak to a nurse. The number wanting a 
home visit who got one was lower at 80%.
There were 685 244 respondents who only wanted to 
see or speak to either a nurse or doctor who also had 
complete information for all covariates of interest. Of 
these 122 597 (weighted percentage 16.0%) wanted to see 
or speak to a nurse, with the remainder wanting to see 
or speak to a GP. Variation in this percentage is shown in 
table 2 along with crude and adjusted ORs. Older patients 
were less likely to want to see or speak to a GPthan younger 
patients (eg, ≥85 vs 55–64 years, adjusted OR 0.76, 95% CI 
0.74 to 0.79). Ethnic minority group patients were much 
more likely to want to see or speak to a GP (eg, Asian vs 
White patients, adjusted OR 1.51, 95% CI 1.47 to 1.56). 
Similarly those who were not confident in managing their 
own health were more likely to want to see or speak to a 
GP (eg, Not at all confident vs Very confident, adjusted 
OR 1.73, 95% CI 1.61 to 1.85).
Being unable to get an appointment of the patients’ 
choice was associated with differences in trust and confi-
dence (table 3) and communication (table 4), among 
patients who reported seeing or speaking to a nurse or 
a GP in their last primary care consultation. The mean 
trust and confidence score for those who had asked to 
see a nurse and did so was 91.0 (on a scale of 0–100). For 
all other combinations patient-rated trust and confidence 
scores were, on average, lower (P<0.001). Patient-reported 
trust and confidence was lowest for those who wished to 
see a GP or wished to speak to a GP, and instead spoke to 
a nurse (adjusted mean difference compared with those 
who wanted to see a nurse and did see a nurse=−15.8, 
95% CI −17.6 to −14.0 and −13.5, 95% CI −15.9 to −11.0, 
respectively), followed by those who wanted to see a GP 
but ended up speaking to, rather than seeing, a GP (−6.5, 
95% CI −7.0 to −5.9). Similar differences were found for 
patient-reported communication scores, with the lowest 
scores for those who wanted to see a GP but spoke to a 
nurse (adjusted mean difference compared with those 
who wanted to see a nurse and did see a nurse=−10.5, 
95% CI −11.7 to −9.3).
DIsCussIOn
In a study of 870 085 respondents from general practices in 
England, we show that the majority of patients in primary 
care are able to see or speak to the health professional 
type (GP vs nurse) of their choice. However, a substan-
tive minority—between 4% and 8%—are not. We found 
evidence that patient consultation preferences vary across 
patient groups. Patients with low confidence in managing 
their own health, younger patients and ethnic minority 
groups were more likely to want to see a GP.
When patients were unable to obtain the type of appoint-
ment of their choice, this was associated with lower confi-
dence and trust in the health professional they saw, and 
poorer patient-rated communication. This difference 
was particularly large among patients who wished to see 
a GP and instead spoke to a nurse. A difference, though 
smaller in magnitude, was also observed for patients who 
wanted to see a nurse and got to speak to a GP. Patients 
whose appointments were with GPs reported similar 
experiences regardless of their initial preference for a 
nurse versus a doctor. Patient experience scores were also 
lower when the patient had asked to see a health profes-
sional (either a GP or a nurse), and ended up having a 
telephone call.
Our study, using data from a large national survey of 
patient experience in primary care, builds on what is 
known from previous research examining the accept-
ability to patients’ of nurse–GP substitution8 9 16 17 and

practice response rates and scores.20 Despite its large 
overall sample, one limitation of our study is the smaller 
size of some individual patient subgroups giving rise to 
larger uncertainty. Another limitation is that we assessed 
patient-reported confidence and trust using the single 
item that represents this concept in the GPPS, and future 
research might consider including additional items to 
provide a comprehensive and multidimensional measure 
of these constructs.
Changing nature of primary care and implications for patient 
confidence and trust
The role of nurses in primary care has changed consider-
ably in the last 30 years, with the advent of advanced nurse 
practitioners, independent nurse prescriber roles and the 
existence of some primary care practices that are led by 
nurses. Some patients appear uncertain about what to 
expect in nurse-led primary care consultations.9 11 In our 
study, we found that patients who got to speak to a nurse 
when they wished to see a GP, reported lowest confidence 
and trust in their eventual consultation. The magnitude 
of this effect represents a large difference of 15 points on 
a scale of 0–100, controlling for sociodemographic char-
acteristics and health status and combines not seeing or 
speaking to the type of practitioner of their choice (ie, 
nurse rather than doctor) and receiving a telephone 
call when they had asked for a face-to-face consultation. 
There are several possible explanations for these find-
ings. Patients may feel that they are being inappropriately 
denied access to GPs, resulting in frustration that could 
affect both trust and the quality of interpersonal commu-
nication (gatekeeper hypothesis). Lack of trust and confi-
dence may also arise because some patients perceive that 
nurses are subordinate to GPs in terms of skills and knowl-
edge (patient confidence hypothesis). Our findings are 
in line with the results from a pragmatic controlled trial 
of telephone triage among patients seeking a same-day 
GP appointment which showed that nurse-led triage was 
associated with somewhat worse patient-reported experi-
ence and lower overall patient satisfaction in comparison 
with usual care.21
Implications for health policy, clinical practice and primary 
care research
A strong vision for reforming primary care in England is 
now emerging.6 This includes expanded roles for phar-
macists, physician associates and a £15 million investment 
in nursing capacity within general practice. When new 
ways of working are introduced, primary care practices 
need to communicate these to patients who may know less 
about the care offered by health professionals other than 
GPs. Building patient confidence and educating patients

about the skills of team members should form part of a 
broader effort to involve patients in the design and devel-
opment of new services. Involving patients in service 
redesign may help to address barriers that affect patient 
willingness to consult with nurses or physician associates, 
for example, patient-reported experiences of incom-
plete or delayed care (including prescription delay), and 
concerns about the loss of provider continuity.22
In developing new models of working, staff training 
needs to be carefully considered. A study of nurse-led 
clinics for patients with osteoarthritis in general prac-
tice found a significant gap between National Institute 
for Health and Care Excellence recommendations and 
the care nurses felt confident and able to deliver.23 Staff 
transitioning in to new roles in patient care or in patient 
triage need to feel adequately prepared, and standardised 
training may be necessary, but insufficient, to ensure 
success.24 New models of care should consider the possible 
intended and unintended consequences for patient expe-
rience of multidisciplinary teams, particularly given the 
policy emphasis on enabling patient choice. Monitoring 
should include any potential adverse effects on patient 
confidence and trust in health professionals. Qualitative 
interviews with patients’ consulting a physician associate 
in general practice highlight a desire for continuity with 
a trusted clinician, the importance of patient choice, 
and the maintenance of trust and confidence in general 
practice.22
In the context of ageing populations, general practices 
are seeing increasing numbers of patients with complex 
health needs and multiple long-term conditions.25 New 
models of care in England emerging, for example, 
through the multispecialty community provider contract 
framework,26 need to consider how to make the best use 
of the primary care workforce. Many GP practices now 
offer nurse-led consultations for patients with chronic 
conditions, which are often age-related, such as diabetes. 
Our results provide some support for this model of 
care, with approximately one in five patients aged 
over 65 wanting an appointment with a nurse. Among 
patients who wanted a nurse appointment and got one, 
patient-reported trust and confidence in the nurse 
consultation was very high (mean score 91.0 on a scale of 
0–100). Further work is needed to ascertain the impacts 
of proposed workforce changes on different patient 
groups. While proposals for nurses to help meet gaps in 
the supply of primary care providers have met with wide 
interest,27 there are important remaining uncertainties 
about the impact of this on patients’ experiences and on 
the maintenance of confidence and trust in primary care 
in the NHS.
