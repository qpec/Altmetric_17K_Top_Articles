Introduction
An endodontic lesion (EL), frequently referred to as apical 
periodontitis, is a polymicrobial endodontic infection resulting 
in destruction of periradicular tissue. Similar to the progression 
of periodontitis, the microbiota shifts toward obligate aerobes 
and gram-negative anaerobes (Siqueira and Rôças 2009a). The 
bacterial invasion and the periapical defense reactions com-
monly reach an equilibrium resulting in an established EL. The 
treatment of ELs is endodontic chemomechanical elimination 
of infection (root canal treatment).
The prevalence of ELs is high: approximately 10% of all 
teeth are endodontically treated, and 5% of all teeth have peri-
apical radiolucencies (Pak et al. 2012). The prevalence of ≥1 
periapical lesions has been reported to be up to 61% (Jiménez-
Pinzón et al. 2004). The biofilm of necrotic root canals 
 
commonly consists of the genera Fusobacterium, Prevotella, 
Eubacterium, Peptostreptococcus, and Porphyromonas (Siqueira 
and Rôças 2009b). Porphyromonas endodontalis is a black-
pigmented gram-negative rod and a key pathogen in apical peri-
odontitis, in light of its high prevalence and virulence factors 
(Rôças et al. 2011; Montagner et al. 2012). It is frequently 
encountered in ELs, with a prevalence of approximately 65% 
(Rôças et al. 2011). It might occupy critical niches in maintain-
ing the microbial community’s stability and virulence (Hong

Abstract
An endodontic lesion (EL) is a common manifestation of endodontic infection where Porphyromonas endodontalis is frequently encountered. 
EL may associate with increased risk for coronary artery disease (CAD) via similar pathways as marginal periodontitis. The aim of this 
cross-sectional study was to delineate the associations between EL and CAD. Subgingival P. endodontalis, its immune response, and serum 
lipopolysaccharide were examined as potential mediators between these 2 diseases. The Finnish Parogene study consists of 508 patients 
(mean age, 62 y) who underwent coronary angiography and extensive clinical and radiographic oral examination. The cardiovascular 
outcomes included no significant CAD (n = 123), stable CAD (n = 184), and acute coronary syndrome (ACS; n = 169). EL was determined 
from a panoramic tomography. We combined data of widened periapical spaces (WPSs) and apical rarefactions to a score of EL: 1, no 
EL (n = 210); 2, ≥1 WPS per 1 apical rarefaction (n = 222); 3, ≥2 apical rarefactions (n = 76). Subgingival P. endodontalis was defined by 
checkerboard DNA-DNA hybridization analysis, and corresponding serum antibodies were determined by ELISA. In our population, 
50.4% had WPSs, and 22.8% apical rarefactions. A total of 51.2% of all teeth with apical rarefactions had received endodontic procedures. 
Subgingival P. endodontalis levels and serum immunoglobulin G were associated with a higher EL score. In the multiadjusted model (age, 
sex, smoking, diabetes, body mass index, alveolar bone loss, and number of teeth), having WPSs associated with stable CAD (odds ratio 
[OR] = 1.94, 95% confidence interval [95% CI] = 1.13 to 3.32, P = 0.016) and highest EL score were associated with ACS (OR = 2.46, 
95% CI = 1.09 to 5.54, P = 0.030). This association was especially notable in subjects with untreated teeth with apical rarefactions (n = 
59, OR = 2.72, 95% CI = 1.16 to 6.40, P = 0.022). Our findings support the hypothesis that ELs are independently associated with CAD 
and in particular with ACS. This is of high interest from a public health perspective, considering the high prevalence of ELs and CAD.

Journal of Dental Research 
et al. 2013). Furthermore, among typical endodontic pathogens, 
only P. endodontalis is able to invade vascular endothelial and 
smooth muscle cells, potentially linking endodontic infection 
with systemic cardiovascular complications (Dorn et al. 2002). 
Increased levels of subgingival P. endodontalis also associate 
with marginal periodontitis but are rarely detectable in health 
(Paster et al. 2001).
Infection triggers the production of an array of cytokines, 
which are involved in the immune response of ELs (Graunaite 
et al. 2012). Systemic inflammatory markers have consistently 
shown to be increased in patients with ELs (Gomes et al. 2013). 
One of the main triggers of this process may be lipopolysac-
charide (LPS), which is produced by gram-negative bacteria. 
High-serum LPS activity is independently associated with an 
increased risk of future cardiometabolic disorders (Pussinen 
 
et al. 2007; Kallio et al. 2015).
The association between marginal periodontitis and cardio-
vascular diseases (CVDs) is well established (Lockhart et al. 
2012). Periodontitis is associated with an increased risk for 
CVDs, most likely via bacteremia, endotoxemia, and a sys-
temic inflammatory burden (Pussinen et al. 2007; Schenkein et al. 
2013). It has been suggested that ELs could increase the risk 
for CVDs via comparable pathways, due to similarities in the 
inflammatory and microbial profiles between marginal peri-
odontitis and ELs (Frisk et al. 2003; Siqueira and Rôças 
2009a). Few studies have addressed the associations between 
ELs and coronary artery disease (CAD), but the results are 
somewhat inconsistent (Frisk et al. 2003; Caplan et al. 2006; 
Joshipura et al. 2006; Caplan et al. 2009; Pasqualini et al. 2012; 
Costa et al. 2014; Petersen et al. 2014; Gomes et al. 2016).
The aim of the present study was to delineate the associa-
tions between radiographically evident ELs and angiographi-
cally verified CAD outcomes. The presence of subgingival 
P. endodontalis, its humoral immune response, and serum LPS 
activities were examined as potential mediators between these 
2 diseases.
Materials and Methods
Population
The COROGENE study consists of 5,297 Finnish adult patients 
who underwent coronary angiography at the Helsinki 
University Central Hospital between June 2006 and March 
2008 and who fulfilled inclusion criteria (Vaara et al. 2012). A 
random sex-stratified subsample comprising approximately 
10% of the COROGENE population was enrolled for compre-
hensive clinical and radiographic oral examinations. Altogether 
508 subjects were examined in the Parogene study. The popu-
lation was grouped according to coronary angiography results; 
no significant CAD (<50% stenosis, n = 123), stable CAD 
(≥50% stenosis, n = 184), acute coronary syndrome (ACS; n = 
169), and ACS-like but no significant CAD (n = 32). Data col-
lection has been described more extensively (Buhlin et al. 
2011). All subjects signed an informed consent, and the study 
design was approved by the local ethics committee. This study 
complied with STROBE guidelines for observational studies.
Examinations
Patients were considered having hypertension, dyslipidemia, 
or diabetes if they had the respective medications. Prior to the 
oral examinations, a dental assistant guided the patients to fill 
in a questionnaire.
All examiners were blinded regarding coronary diagnosis. 
Two calibrated periodontal specialists performed oral exami-
nations approximately 6 to 20 wk (mean ± SD: 113 ± 30 d; 
range, 37 to 224 d) after the coronary angiographies (Buhlin 
 
et al. 2011). A full dental chart was performed, which recorded 
carious teeth, probing pocket depth, bleeding on probing, poor 
filling margins, root remnants, and number of teeth. Amputation 
was defined as total coronal pulpectomy. Subgingival bacterial 
samples were collected from dentate subjects (n = 478; Mäntylä 
et al. 2013). Quantitative data of subgingival P. endodontalis 
were acquired by checkerboard DNA-DNA hybridization as 
described earlier (Socransky et al. 2004).
All dentate (n = 476) and edentulous (n = 32) subjects 
underwent digital panoramic tomography analyzed at the 
Institute of Dentistry, University of Helsinki. The number of 
teeth with periapically widened spaces and apical rarefactions 
were recorded by a radiologist specialized in oral and maxil-
lofacial radiology. The definitions are in concordance with the 
commonly used periapical index (PAI); widened periapical 
spaces were scored as PAI = 3 and apical rarefaction as PAI = 
4 to 5 (Ørstavik et al. 1986). Mild to severe alveolar bone loss 
(ABL) was considered a proxy for mild to severe marginal 
periodontitis (Hyvärinen et al. 2012).
Blood samples were drawn from each patient at the time of 
the coronary angiography and stored at −80 C°. The Helsinki 
University Central Hospital Laboratory analyzed the high- 
sensitivity C-reactive protein. Serum LPS activity was deter-
mined by Limulus amebocyte lysate assay coupled with a 
chromogenic substrate, and the interassay coefficient of varia-
tion was 5.5% (n = 6). Serum immunoglobulin A and G (IgA 
and IgG) levels against whole cell antigen of P. endodontalis 
were determined with enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay 
(ELISA; Pussinen et al. 2002; Pussinen et al. 2011). All sam-
ples were analyzed in 1:100 and 1:200 dilutions as duplicates 
along with a set of blanks and control sera, which were used to 
normalize the absorbances after the whole population was ana-
lyzed. The interassay coefficient of variation was 7.9%.
Statistical Analyses
For this cross-sectional study, we designed a score for each 
patient according to ELs as follows: score 1, no EL (n = 210, 
including 32 edentulous subjects); score 2, ≥1 widened periapi-
cal space and/or 1 apical rarefaction (n = 222); score 3, ≥2 apical 
rarefactions (n = 76). The groups were selected to reflect a con-
tinuum of the patients’ infectious endodontic status. The limit for 
statistical significance was 0.05. The statistical difference among 
groups were analyzed with χ2 test for categorical variables and 
Kruskal-Wallis test for continuous variables. The association 
between endodontic status and cardiologic outcome was ana-
lyzed with multinomial logistic regression with the reference

group being patients with no significant CAD (n = 123). The 
association between presence of P. endodontalis and bivariate 
periapical outcomes was similarly analyzed. All models were 
statistically significant in the final model fitting test, and numeric 
problems were not present (SE < 2). No significant factor-by-
factor interactions were observed between dependent variables 
in the full factorial interaction analyses, excluding collinearity 
issues. Subjects with ACS-like but no significant CAD (n = 32) 
were excluded from the association analyses due to their low 
number. Three models were applied to adjust for clinically rele-
vant confounders: model 1, adjusted with age and sex; model 2, 
additionally adjusted with smoking (never vs. ever), diabetes 
mellitus, and BMI; model 3, additionally adjusted with ABL (no 
vs. mild to severe) and number of teeth present.
In the characteristics of the population, skewed continuous 
variables are presented as medians and interquartile range. 
Serum LPS levels and P. endodontalis IgA/IgG levels across 
groups for ELs and cardiologic outcome were analyzed with 
Kruskal-Wallis tests and Jonckheere-Terpstra tests. The poten-
tial interactive effects of ELs (scores 1, 2, and 3) and cardio-
logic outcome (no CAD, stable CAD, ACS) on serum LPS were 
analyzed with 2-way analysis of variance (type 3 sum of 
squares). The similar interaction analyses were conducted for 
ELs (scores 1, 2, and 3) and presence of subgingival P. endodon-
talis (yes/no) on IgA/IgG levels. All statistical analyses were 
conducted with the SPSS Statistics software (version 22; IBM).
Results
Oral Status
Compared with those without significant CAD, subjects with 
stable CAD or ACS were more often male (51%, 75%, and 
73%, respectively; P < 0.001). Those with stable CAD were 
older (65 ± 8 vs. 61 ± 9 y; P = 0.001). Patients with ACS were 
more frequently smokers (ever, 58% vs. 44%, P = 0.031). 
There was no significant difference regarding caries, root canal 
fillings, inadequate root fillings, amputations, poor filling mar-
gins, root remnants, or teeth with widened periapical space or 
apical rarefactions in relation to cardiologic diagnosis in uni-
variate chi-square analyses (Table 1).
Approximately half of the population had carious lesions, 
and more than half had inadequate root fillings. Altogether, 
50.4% of our population had at least 1 widened periapical 
space, and 22.8% had at least 1 apical rarefaction. Altogether, 
the subjects had 10,163 teeth. Of these 1,026 (10.1%) were 
root canal treated. There were 172 teeth with apical rarefac-
tions; 81 (47.1%) were root canal treated; and 7 (4.1%) had the 
coronal pulp amputated. Thus, 51.2% of all teeth with apical 
rarefactions had past endodontic procedures.
Endodontic Lesions and CAD
The subjects with stable CAD had more likely ABL (83% vs. 
69%, P = 0.007), but they also more frequently had at least 1 
widened periapical space (55% vs. 44%, P = 0.050). The 
adjusted associations between ELs and CAD outcomes are pre-
sented with the nonsignificant CAD as the reference group 
(Table 2). Having ≥1 widened periapical space (vs. 0) was sig-
nificantly associated with stable CAD, with odds ratios (ORs) 
ranging between 1.63 and 1.94 depending on the level of 
adjustments. Similar analyses regarding apical rarefactions 
yielded nonsignificant associations. We repeated the analyses 
separately for subjects with ≥1 apical rarefaction (vs. 0) in 
teeth with/without root canal treatment. Having root canal–
treated teeth with apical rarefactions (n = 51) did not associate 
significantly with CAD outcome, but having untreated teeth 
with ELs (n = 57) provided OR values of 2.72 to 2.91 for ACS 
depending on the level of adjustments. This association was 
especially evident in patients >60 y (model 3: OR = 3.78, 95% 
confidence interval [95% CI] = 1.01 to 14.2, P = 0.049).
When ELs were studied as a score combining information 
of widened periapical space and rarefactions, there was a sig-
nificant association with score 3 and ACS (OR = 2.31 to 2.49). 
Scores 2 and 3 were also associated with an increased risk of 
stable CAD, but the results were of borderline significance or 
affected by the adjustments for ABL and number of teeth.
Mediators of the Association
After the association of ELs with increased CAD risk was 
recovered, the groups of ELs (score, 1 to 3) were characterized

(Table 3). There was an evident increasing linear trend regard-
ing smoking, dyslipidemia, ACS, ABL, bleeding on probing, 
number of teeth, and high-sensitivity C-reactive protein across 
groups but no age or sex differences.
The presence and amount of subgingival P. endodontalis and 
serum IgA/IgG levels were studied across scored groups of ELs 
(Table 4). First, a total of 65.8% of the whole population had 
subgingival P. endodontalis present. The presence and levels of 
subgingival P. endodontalis differed significantly across 3 
groups with an increasing trend. The presence of P. endodontalis 
associated significantly with ≥1 widened periapical space and 
≥1 apical rarefaction in a multiadjusted binomial logistic regres-
sion (model 3: OR = 1.53, 95% CI = 1.00 to 2.33, P = 0.045; OR 
= 2.29, 95% CI = 1.34 to 3.90, P = 0.002, respectively). Second, 
the total levels and highest tertiles of bacteria-specific serum 
IgA/IgG were compared across the groups. Being in the highest 
tertile (vs. lower 2 tertiles) of P. endodontalis IgG was associated 
with a higher score of EL, and levels of IgG differed among the 
groups with a borderline significance (P = 0.072; Table 4). There 
was a statistically significant trend of higher median P. endodon-
talis IgG with higher scores of ELs (Jonckheere-Terpstra test 
statistics = 41,287, z = 2.279, P = 0.023). Third, we analyzed 
whether EL score, presence of P. endodontalis, and the antibody 
response against it were associated. Median serum P. endodon-
talis IgA/IgG levels across groups of ELs and present subgingi-
val P. endodontalis are illustrated (Fig. A). The antibody levels 
differed between subjects with and without subgingival 
 
P. endodontalis (P = 0.034 for IgA and P = 0.036 for IgG). The 
interaction of effects between the EL score and the presence of 
subgingival P. endodontalis on serum antibodies was, however, 
not significant. Finally, in a binomial logistic regression model, 
the presence of subgingival P. endodontalis or high levels of cor-
responding antibodies did not significantly associate with the 
cardiologic diagnosis (data not shown).
The levels of serum LPS across the groups with different 
scores of ELs and CAD outcomes are illustrated in Figure B. 
Serum LPS levels differed among the 3 CAD outcome groups 
(P = 0.002) but not with scores of ELs. Two-way analysis of 
variance failed to show differences by serum LPS between car-
diologic outcomes and ELs. Serum LPS did not associate with 
subgingival P. endodontalis or corresponding serum antibodies 
(data not shown).

Discussion
We demonstrated an association between ELs and cardiologic 
outcomes, especially ACS, which was independent of peri-
odontitis and its risk factors. The association between apical 
rarefactions and ACS was more evident in patients with 
untreated ELs. ELs were associated with subgingival 
 
P. endodontalis and corresponding serum IgG levels, which 
illustrates the imbalance in the oral biofilm and subsequent sys-
temic immunologic response that may link these 2 diseases.
Widened periapical spaces reflect either symptomatic teeth 
with irreversible pulpitis or precursors for established ELs in 
necrotic teeth (Carrotte 2004). In our study, the widened peri-
apical spaces were more likely to reflect early apical lesions 
while patients were not actively seeking dental treatment. We 
combined the data of widened periapical spaces and apical

rarefactions in the EL score to simultaneously study 2 stages of 
the same disease entity. The group with ≥2 apical rarefactions 
(score 3) had a significant 131% to 149% increased OR for 
ACS even after extensive adjustment for confounders.
Although some studies have resulted in unconvincing 
results (Frisk et al. 2003), most have shown a significant asso-
ciation between ELs and CVD (Caplan et al. 2006; Joshipura 
 
et al. 2006; Caplan et al. 2009; Pasqualini et al. 2012; Petersen 
et al. 2014; Costa et al. 2014; Gomes et al. 2016). Thus, it 
seems plausible that ELs associate with an increased risk for 
CAD. Petersen et al. (2014) showed that ELs, in particular 
without root canal treatment, associate with the atherosclerotic 
burden of the abdominal aorta. In our study, having ≥1 
untreated apical rarefactions was associated with ACS, with 
ORs ranging from 2.72 to 2.91 depending on the level of 
adjustments, while a respective finding with endodontically 
treated teeth did not. Our findings support the hypothesis that 
endodontic treatment might attenuate the association between 
ELs and CAD. To our knowledge, these are the first studies to 
separate treated and untreated teeth when analyzing the asso-
ciation between ELs and CAD.
Three models were applied in the multinomial logistic 
regression analyses, and the adjustments were selected due to 
established risk factors. Missing teeth have frequently been 
associated with CVDs and were included in the multiadjusted 
model (Hung et al. 2004; Watt et al. 2012; Liljestrand et al. 
2015). We chose to include ABL in the model as a proxy for 
marginal periodontitis, as it is a potential confounder and has 
been frequently ignored in previous studies investigating ELs 
and CVD. ABL and missing teeth were both associated with 
ELs in this study. Since ELs consistently associate with CAD 
after adjustment for marginal periodontitis, it might be an inde-
pendent risk factor for CAD and should be accounted for in 
future research (Gomes et al. 2013).
In our study, the level and presence of subgingival 
 
P. endodontalis were associated with our score for ELs, also 
after adjustments for marginal periodontitis. Our findings sup-
port the hypothesis that P. endodontalis is a significant factor 
in the progression of ELs and has biomarker potential for a 
pathologic endodontic and periodontal biofilm community 
(Martinho et al. 2010; Rôças et al. 2011). We showed a statisti-
cally significant association between the presence of subgingi-
val P. endodontalis and serum IgG/IgA against it, demonstrating 
bacteremia and systemic immunologic response. Furthermore, 
high levels of serum IgG, but not IgA, against P. endodontalis 
correlated with our scores for ELs. IgG is more stable than 
IgA, thus making it a more appealing antibody for clarifying a 
history of infection. In patients with ELs, the major immuno-
globulin against P. endodontalis antigens produced at the site is 
IgG (Ogawa et al. 1992). Therefore, ELs might lack the nature 
of repeated or recent antigen exposure, which is required for 
elevated P. endodontalis IgA levels. To our knowledge, this 
study is the first to assess associations between P. endodonta-
lis–specific antibodies and ELs. Clearly, the serology associ-
ated with ELs requires further attention.
Bacterial-derived LPS is one of the main inductors of sys-
temic inflammation, and endotoxemia is associated with future 
CVD events (Pussinen et al. 2007). Potential mechanisms link-
ing oral infections to CVDs include bacteremia and endotox-
emia (Pussinen and Könönen 2016). We analyzed these 
components considering subgingival P. endodontalis as a puta-
tive antigen, with serum antibodies and LPS reflecting sys-
temic exposure. Median serum LPS activities were associated 
with CAD outcome but not with P. endodontalis or ELs. Taken

together, we failed to show that bacteremia or endotoxemia 
deriving from this single species would mediate the association 
between ELs and CAD. Therefore, further studies are needed, 
including a proper characterization of root canal biofilm and 
systemic response to it.
There is a high variability among determinations of CAD 
outcomes (Cotti and Mercuro 2015). Our data stand out, with 
an extensive set of oral parameters and an accurate angio-
graphically verified cardiologic diagnosis as the outcome. In 
addition, panoramic tomographies have been dependable for 
diagnosing ELs in comparable studies (Gomes et al. 2016).
The main limitation of our study is the cross-sectional 
setup; hence, conclusions of causality cannot be established. 
The patients were limited to those with an initial indication for 
coronary angiography (e.g., stable and atypical chest pain, val-
vular heart disease, or cardiomyopathy), which may lead to 
selection bias without healthy subjects. Patients with cardiac 
complications may exhibit unhealthier behavior reflecting on 
oral health in general. However, our population (aged 33 to 
82 y, 62.1 ± 10.1) was not limited to any specific age group. 
Although our analyses were statistically adjusted, residual con-
founding cannot be ruled out. For instance, we did not have the 
information on socioeconomic status. While all Finnish adults 
have the same prerequisites for adequate treatment, the role of 
socioeconomic status as confounder is diminished. Also, we 
had no information available on the time when the teeth with 
root canal fillings had been treated, since they may have been 
in a healing phase or represented persistent or secondary end-
odontic infections with a slightly different microbial flora 
(Siqueira and Rôças 2009a). Furthermore, no information was 
available on the endodontic microflora, as discussed above.
There seems to be a paradigm shift in the field of endodon-
tics—from a field of pain management, tooth preservation, and 
control of infections toward a perspective where all oral infec-
tions are risks for systemic complications (Han and Wang 
2013). Further studies are needed to evaluate if ELs are a true 
risk factor for CVD, if other pathogens and their humoral 
responses mediate systemic effects, and if treatment for ELs 
reduces the risk for future CVDs.
Conclusion
Our findings support the hypothesis that ELs associate inde-
pendently with CAD and in particular ACS, consolidating the 
role of oral conditions in evaluating total cardiovascular risk. 
Subgingival P. endodontalis and high levels of corresponding 
serum IgG associate with EL. The potential association 
between ELs and CVDs is of high interest given the high prev-
alence of both diseases.
