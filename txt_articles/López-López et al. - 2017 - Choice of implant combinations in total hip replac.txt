ABSTRACT
OBJECTIVE
To compare the survival of different implant 
combinations for primary total hip replacement (THR). 
DESIGN
Systematic review and network meta-analysis. 
DATA SOURCES
Medline, Embase, The Cochrane Library, ClinicalTrials.
gov, WHO International Clinical Trials Registry 
Platform, and the EU Clinical Trials Register.
REVIEW METHODS
Published randomised controlled trials comparing 
different implant combinations. Implant combinations 
were defined by bearing surface materials (metal-on-
polyethylene, ceramic-on-polyethylene, ceramic-on-
ceramic, or metal-on-metal), head size (large ≥36 mm 
or small <36 mm), and fixation technique (cemented, 
uncemented, hybrid, or reverse hybrid). Our reference 
implant combination was metal-on-polyethylene (not 
highly cross linked), small head, and cemented. The 
primary outcome was revision surgery at 0-2 years and 
2-10 years after primary THR. The secondary outcome 
was the Harris hip score reported by clinicians.
RESULTS
77 studies were included in the systematic review, 
and 15 studies (3177 hips) in the network meta-
analysis for revision. There was no evidence that the 
risk of revision surgery was reduced by other implant 
combinations compared with the reference implant 
combination. Although estimates are imprecise, 
metal-on-metal, small head, cemented implants 
(hazard ratio 4.4, 95% credible interval 1.6 to 16.6) 
and resurfacing (12.1, 2.1 to 120.3) increase the risk 
of revision at 0-2 years after primary THR compared 
with the reference implant combination. Similar 
results were observed for the 2-10 years period. 31 
studies (2888 patients) were included in the analysis 
of Harris hip score. No implant combination had a 
better score than the reference implant combination.
CONCLUSIONS
Newer implant combinations were not found to 
be better than the reference implant combination 
(metal-on-polyethylene (not highly cross linked), small 
head, cemented) in terms of risk of revision surgery 
or Harris hip score. Metal-on-metal, small head, 
cemented implants and resurfacing increased the 
risk of revision surgery compared with the reference 
implant combination. The results were consistent 
with observational evidence and were replicated in 
sensitivity analysis but were limited by poor reporting 
across studies.

Introduction
Total hip replacement (THR) is one of the most common 
surgical procedures performed worldwide. In England, 
Wales, and Northern Ireland, the National Joint 
Registry recorded that 796 636 THRs were performed 
between 2003 and 2015.1 In the USA an estimated 
2.5 million people are living with a hip replacement.2 
The main indications for elective THR are pain and 
functional limitations owing to osteoarthritis.3
In a primary THR, both the acetabulum and the 
femoral head are replaced: a metal stem is inserted into 
the femur with a modular head that articulates with an 
artificial cup, the acetabular component (metal-on-
polyethylene). The most widely used combination of 
these bearing surfaces comprises a metal femoral head 
and a polyethylene acetabular cup. It was developed 
by Sir John Charnley and has been in use since 
the early 1960s.4 Long term survival of these early 
implants was good, with around 77-81% not needing 
revision 25 years after primary THR.5 An alternative 
to primary THR is resurfacing hip replacement, in 
which the acetabulum is replaced with a metal cup, 
and the femoral head is trimmed and capped with a 
surface replacement femoral prosthesis. In England 
and Wales, the use of resurfacings has declined, from 
10.8% of hip replacements in 2006 to less than 1% in 
2015.1 With the increasing use of THR in younger and 
more active patients where revision rates are higher,6 
and concerns about the role of polyethylene wear 
particles in osteolysis and loosening,5 new bearing 
surface materials were introduced.
Current implants have four main combinations of 
femoral head and acetabular bearing surface materials:

metal-on-polyethylene, 
ceramic-on-polyethylene, 
ceramic-on-ceramic, or metal-on-metal.7 Ceramic-on-
metal implants are uncommon. Femoral head sizes vary, 
typically ranging from 22.225 mm to 50 mm in diameter. 
The possible fixation techniques (the method of attaching 
the bearing surface material to the bone) are cemented 
(when both components are cemented), uncemented 
(neither component is cemented), hybrid (the femoral 
stem but not the acetabular cup is cemented), or reverse 
hybrid (the acetabular cup but not the femoral stem is 
cemented). In early studies, implant failure after primary 
THR was attributed to the use of cement, but there is 
currently little evidence that implant survival rates are 
superior using other fixation techniques.8 Figure 1 shows 
a resurfacing implant; a ceramic-on-ceramic, large head, 
uncemented implant; and a ceramic-on-polyethylene, 
small head, cemented implant.
When an implant fails (eg, due to loosening, infection, 
or dislocation) patients may endure severe pain and 
disability and require surgical revision. Although the 
key patient expectations of THR are long term reduction 
in pain, improvement in function, and participation in 
recreational interests,5 these outcomes are inevitably 
linked to implant survival.9 10 Joint registries, with 
extensive records of patients over time,11 play an 
important role in monitoring the long term performance 
of implants. An analysis of National Joint Registry 
data between 2003 and 2011 found higher revision 
rates for metal-on-metal implants.12 In registries, 
implant combinations are selected for patients based 
on individual characteristics, making comparisons 
between implant combinations susceptible to bias. 
Randomised controlled trials overcome the limitation 
of patient selection but often lack long term follow-
up. Systematic reviews and meta-analyses have been 
conducted,13-16 but they have not provided a complete 
overview of randomised evidence on combinations of 
implant materials, or acquired key information from 
study authors to allow a focus on revision outcomes.
We present a systematic review of randomised 
controlled trial evidence comparing rates of revision 
surgery, and of doctor assessed and patient assessed 
outcomes of the various bearing surface materials, head 
sizes, and fixation techniques (implant combinations) 
used in THR. For the statistical integration of results, 
we used a network meta-analysis approach, which 
combines direct and indirect evidence from the 
implant combinations that are currently available for 
primary THR. 
Methods
Study eligibility and selection
Randomised controlled trials including patients aged 
18 years or older with a diagnosis of osteoarthritis in 
the majority (>50%) of patients, comparing different 
bearing surface materials (including resurfacing) or 
head sizes in primary total hip replacement (THR) were 
eligible. Web appendix 1 shows the possible implant 
combinations. We categorised head sizes as large (≥36 
mm in diameter) or small (<36 mm). Polyethylene 
materials were further classified as highly cross linked 
(a newer generation of polyethylene) or not highly 
cross linked (including conventional polyethylene 
and other types of polyethylene). We excluded studies 
of patients receiving simultaneous bilateral THR, 
emergency surgery, or revision hip replacement.
The primary outcome was first revision surgery after 
primary THR or resurfacing. The secondary outcomes 
were the Harris hip score reported by clinicians,17 
and the Oxford hip score18 and Western Ontario and 
McMaster Universities osteoarthritis index score 
(WOMAC)19 based on patient report.
We undertook a systematic search of the literature in 
February 2015 (updated in July 2016). Web appendix 
2 shows the search strategy as applied in Medline. This 
was tailored to each database, and used in Medline, 
Embase, and The Cochrane Library. We also searched 
the clinical trials databases ClinicalTrials.gov, WHO 
International Clinical Trials Registry Platform, and the 
EU Clinical Trials Register. We checked reference lists of 
identified studies and tracked citations of key articles 
in Web of Science. Websites of orthopaedic conferences 
since January 2012 were examined to identify current 
unpublished studies. Our searches had no language 
restrictions.
We registered our systematic review prospectively 
in PROSPERO (CRD42015019435). We formulated the 
research question according to the PICO (population, 
intervention, comparison, and outcome) principle.20 
The systematic review methods were based on those 
recommended by Cochrane,21 and reporting was in 
accordance with the Reporting Items for Systematic 
Reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA) guidelines.22 
Further details of the methods can be found in the 
published protocol.7
Data collection and assessment of risk of bias
Two reviewers independently screened titles and 
abstracts and extracted data from the included studies. 
They contacted authors of published studies, protocols, 
and trial register entries for additional information when 
necessary. The reviewers independently assessed the risk 
of bias using the Cochrane risk of bias tool.21 They noted 
key explanations for a high risk of bias assessment.

Data synthesis and statistical analysis
To define interventions we considered combinations 
of bearing surface materials, head sizes, and fixation 
techniques. We excluded studies using bearing surface 
materials that are not commonly used in clinical 
practice, and studies assessed at high risk of bias for 
the outcomes of interest.
Using the network suite of commands for Stata,23 
we generated network plots for each outcome to 
illustrate which interventions had been compared 
directly in the included studies. Network meta-
analysis is an extension of standard meta-analysis to 
compare multiple treatments based on randomised 
controlled trial evidence, which forms a connected 
network of comparisons.24 Treatment effect estimates 
from 
network 
meta-analysis 
exploit 
both 
the 
direct comparisons within trials and the indirect 
comparisons across trials. As the reference implant, 
we chose a widely used combination, the metal-on-
polyethylene (not highly cross linked), small head, 
cemented implant.4 6 All network meta-analyses 
were implemented in a bayesian framework using 
OpenBUGS software (version 3.2.3).25 We used fixed 
effect models, as few replications of each implant 
comparison were available for analyses, and assessed 
consistency between direct and indirect evidence by 
comparing the fit of the consistency model with the fit 
of an inconsistency model.
The effect measure for revision surgery events 
was the hazard ratio. We modelled the data using 
a binomial likelihood and a logistic link function. 
The unit of analysis was the hip. Studies reported at 
different time points, with several studies reporting 
at multiple times (see web appendix 3), all of which 
were included in the analyses. Based on clinical 
expertise and the literature, we considered two periods 
after primary THR for implant failure: 0-2 years and 
2-10 years. Ten years was often the longest follow-up 
available in the literature and an acceptable survival 
duration for clinical advisors of the study. We assumed 
piecewise constant hazard ratios over the two periods 
but assumed the log hazard ratios in the later period 
were related to those in the earlier period by a random 
walk model.26 This model assumes that log hazard 
ratios in the second and third period are normally 
distributed around those in the first and second 
periods, respectively. Web appendix 3 provides details.
In sensitivity analyses, we considered a different cut-
off point for the change in the hazard ratio (0-5 and 
5-10 years). Revision surgery is a rare outcome and 
large numbers of primary surgeries or a long follow-
up period after surgery is often required for events 
to occur. To achieve stable results, we implemented 
continuity corrections by adding 0.5 revision events 
to both arms of studies with zero revisions in some 
(but not all) arms, and if stable results were still not 
obtained, we excluded studies with zero counts.
The secondary outcomes of Harris hip score reported 
by the clinician and other outcomes reported by the 
patient were continuous variables. The unit of analysis 
for these outcomes was the patient. We computed 
differences in mean score between treatment groups 
at the longest follow-up time point, using a normal 
likelihood and an identity link function.
Owing to limitations in data availability, statistical 
integration of results for other outcome measures—
namely, those reported by the patient, as well as 
the adjustment for age in meta-regression, was not 
possible.
Patient involvement
Patients and hip surgeons were actively involved in 
designing the study and interpreting and disseminating 
the results. AB runs two patient involvement groups 
at the Musculoskeletal Research Unit, Southmead 
Hospital: one group consisting of nine people with 
musculoskeletal conditions, most of whom have had 
joint replacements, including THR; and a second 
consisting of four patients who have had THR revision 
surgery. Both groups provided continuous feedback 
to the team throughout the study. Two lay members 
were invited to two steering group meetings and 
provided patient views on ongoing works. EMRM and 
AB also met at the start and end of the project with hip 
surgeons at Southmead Hospital for additional clinical 
advice on study design and impact of findings for 
clinical practice. Whether the studies included in the 
review had any patient involvement was not evaluated.

review and full papers were obtained. Two reviewers 
independently assessed full papers, and 77 unique 
randomised controlled trials described in 136 articles 
were included in the review. Figure 2 summarises 
the reasons for study exclusions. Web appendix 4 
summarises the characteristics and references of 
studies.
The 77 randomised controlled trials included 
patients from 83 centres, geographically dispersed, 
mainly throughout North America and European 
countries. Studies included between two and five arms 
(169 arms in total). Allocation to randomised implant 
combinations ranged from 5 to 349 hips (mean 68), 
with a total of 11 700 hips randomised. We only 
included data from time points at which follow-up 
was attempted for all patients in the trial. The mean 
age of patients in randomised groups ranged from 47.1 
to 72.6 years (median 61 years) and the percentage of 
female patients ranged from 10.8% to 100% (median 
58% females). Studies in the review were powered on 
a range of different outcomes, most commonly hip 
scores reported by clinicians and patients. No studies 
were powered to detect differences in revision rates.
Web appendix 5 summarises our risk of bias 
assessments, including justifications for considering 
studies to be at high risk of bias. The assessments 
were undertaken from the perspective of the primary 
outcome (revision surgery), although they also apply 
to the secondary outcome (Harris hip score reported by 
clinicians), as both outcomes involve clinical judgment 
and are measured at similar time points across studies. 
Our assessment suggested that risk of bias was low in 
30 studies, high in 12, and unclear in 35. Risk of bias 
related to high losses to follow-up, differences in follow-
up between randomised groups, baseline differences 
in groups, and selective reporting. Unclear risk of bias 
related to limited reporting of methods and blinding. 
Surgeons are often not blinded to the allocation of 
interventions in surgical trials. Nonetheless, revision is 
an objective outcome, and hence we decided to keep 
studies at unclear risk of bias in the analyses.
Out of the 77 studies included in the review, three 
did not consider commonly used implant combinations 
(two were rarely used ceramic-on-metal implants and 
one used the discontinued Hylamer polyethylene), 
and 14 did not provide enough information to define 
an implant combination (eg, comparison of head sizes 
both classified as small in our study), leaving 60 studies 
available for statistical integration of results. The 
maximum follow-up periods in these 60 studies ranged 
between three months and 13 years (median 2 years).
Primary outcome: revision surgery
Thirty of the 60 studies provided pairwise comparisons 
of different implant combinations, after excluding 17 
studies that did not report revision surgeries and 13 
studies with zero events in all arms. Web appendix 6 
shows the results for the pairwise comparisons across 
those 30 studies (supplementary figs 1 and 2). There is 
no strong evidence of a difference in rates of revision 
surgery at 0-2 years after primary total hip replacement 
(THR). Most effect estimates had wide confidence 
intervals, and all of them included the null value 
(hazard ratio of 1). More studies are available for the 
2-10 years period; still there is no clear evidence, in 
the studies with a low risk of bias, for superiority of one 
implant combination over another.
Out of the 30 studies providing pairwise comparisons, 
15 (3177 randomised hips) provided data for network 
meta-analysis of revision surgery after primary THR. 
Exclusions consisted of five studies assessed to be at 
high risk of bias for the primary outcome, five studies 
of implant combinations disconnected from the main 
network, and five studies with zero events in at least 
one arm (no revisions reported). These studies had 
small samples or short term follow-up, or both, causing 
convergence problems.
Figure 3 shows the network plots at 0-2 years and 
2-10 years after primary THR, with the reference 
implant combination at the bottom of the plots. These 
illustrate the implant combination comparisons that 
were made within the 15 included studies. Thick

lines represent comparisons that were reported in 
two studies; the number of hips contributing to each 
comparison is also displayed. Only two of these studies 
contributed data to both periods. Only small head 
implant combinations were available for 0-2 years. The 
random walk model allowed us to analyse all studies 
simultaneously for all implant combinations for both 
periods.
Figure 4 shows the results of the network meta-
analysis for revision surgery at 0-2 years and 2-10 
years after primary THR. Metal-on-metal, small 
head, cemented implants and resurfacing hip 
replacements increased the risk of revision surgery 
compared with the reference implant combination 
(metal-on-polyethylene (not highly cross linked), 
small head, cemented) for both periods. Although 
estimates are imprecise, we found that the metal-
on-metal, small head, cemented implant (hazard 
ratio 4.4, 95% credible interval 1.6 to 16.6) and 
resurfacing (12.1, 2.1 to 120.3) increase the risk of 
revision surgery compared with the reference implant 
combination at 0-2 years after primary THR. We 
observed similar results for the 2-10 years period. 
All implant combinations yielded, on average, higher 
rates of revision surgery than the reference implant 
combination, except for ceramic-on-ceramic, small 
head, uncemented implants, but the 95% credible 
intervals for both periods were wide and included the 
null value (hazard ratio of 1).
Analysing each period separately (without the 
random walk model, but using a fixed effects model) 
and considering a different cut-off point for the 
period after primary THR (0-5 and 5-10 years) yielded 
similar results (see supplementary figs 3-5 in web 
appendix 6). There was no evidence of inconsistency 
between direct and indirect evidence based on both 
comparisons of consistency and inconsistency model 
fits and comparison of pairwise (supplementary figs 1 
and 2 in web appendix 6) and network meta-analysis 
(fig 4) results, although this may be due to the high 
levels of imprecision. In a separate sensitivity analysis, 
we excluded resurfacing hip replacements and arms 
including fewer than 20 hips. Both approaches had an 
impact on revision surgery at 2-10 years, resulting in 
a disconnected network that excluded some relevant 
implant combinations (such as metal-on-metal, small 
head, uncemented) and showed no differences among 
the implant combinations that remained in the main 
network.
Secondary outcome: Harris hip score reported by 
clinicians
In 31 of the 62 studies (2888 patients) there was 
enough information to compare the Harris hip score 
for different implant combinations, with follow-up 
periods between 3 and 101 months (median 24.5 
months). Figure 5 shows the network plot of 19

the network meta-analysis results for the secondary 
outcome.
There is no evidence that any implant combination 
provides a better outcome on the Harris hip score than 
the reference implant combination. Our estimates 
provide some evidence that the reference implant 
combination is associated with a better Harris hip 
score than metal-on-metal, small head implants, and 
most uncemented implants (fig 6). As the distribution 
of Harris hip scores was negatively skewed, we ran 
additional analyses using a log-normal distribution, 
but this did not impact the results.
Outcomes reported by patients
Twenty eight studies reported disease or joint specific 
outcomes reported by patients (Western Ontario and 
McMaster Universities osteoarthritis index (WOMAC) 
and Oxford hip score). A small number of studies 
reported other generic patient outcome measures. 
Data on WOMAC and Oxford hip score outcomes was 
of poor quality and inconsistently reported across 
studies (different scoring methods; missing measures 
for average, variance, or sample size; report of a subset 
of the scale; and a wide range of follow-up points). We 
were therefore unable to proceed with the statistical 
integration of these results. After excluding four studies 
at high risk of bias, we summarised WOMAC and Oxford 
hip score outcomes narratively (see web appendix 7). 
In multiple randomised controlled trials there was 
no suggestion that outcomes reported by patients 
differed between metal-on-polyethylene and other 
combinations of bearing surface material (ceramic-on-
ceramic, metal-on-metal, or ceramic-on-polyethylene) 
or between metal femoral heads in combination with 
different types of polyethylene acetabular surfaces. 
Similarly, outcomes reported by patients did not differ 
when a ceramic implant was used in combination with 
different types of polyethylene acetabular surface, or 
with a ceramic surface. One study27 reported a better 
outcome by patient self report in the long term for 
those receiving hip resurfacing compared with metal-
on-metal implants. This was not confirmed in two other 
randomised controlled trials.28 29 Other combinations 
were explored in single randomised controlled trials, 
with no suggestion that any specific bearing surface 
material combination gave a more favourable outcome 
reported by patients in the long term.

that newer implant combinations are superior to the 
reference implant combination (metal-on-polyethylene 
(not highly cross linked), small head, cemented) both 
for risk of revision surgery and for the Harris hip score 
reported by clinicians. Resurfacing and metal-on-
metal, small head, cemented implants increase the 
risk of revision surgery compared with the reference 
implant combination. The studies included in our 
network meta-analysis pre-date the recall of metal-
on-metal implants, as patients were followed up until 
2010 at the latest. Our findings were similar across 
the 0-2 years and 2-10 years after primary total hip 
replacement (THR) periods and were replicated in a 
variety of sensitivity analyses.
A previous systematic review of randomised 
controlled trials also found that resurfacings were 
more likely to be revised than metal-on-polyethylene 
implants.13 This evidence is also supported by 
observational studies using the National Joint 
Registry cohort, which found that resurfacings and 
metal-on-metal implant combinations increased the 
risk of revision surgery compared with metal-on-
polyethylene combinations.12 30 These findings led to 
a change in the UK National Institute for Health and 
Care Excellence guidance on the use of prostheses 
with a risk of revision surgery at 10 years after primary 
THR from below 10% to below 5%.31 32 Registry data 
also suggests that ceramic-on-ceramic, large head 
implants might improve implant survival compared 
with metal-on-polyethylene implants, but this finding 
is prone to selection bias, and data from randomised 
controlled trials were not available in our study to test 
this hypothesis. One observational study found lower 
risks of revision surgery for implant combinations 
with highly cross linked polyethylenes,33 whereas we 
found no evidence in favour of highly cross linked 
polyethylenes compared with other polyethylenes. Our 
finding may result from a lack of data in our network 
meta-analysis to compare outcomes, but is in line with 
published evidence from six national and regional 
registries.34
Strengths and weaknesses of this study
We performed an extensive literature search on 
combinations of hip prosthetic implant combinations, 
which include all available randomised controlled trial 
evidence, irrespective of language, sample size, and 
duration of follow-up. Revision surgery after primary 
THR is a rare outcome. For statistical integration of 
results, we had to exclude some smaller studies without 
revision events to obtain stable results. Few studies 
directly compared the same implant combinations, 
hence we could not estimate and assess between 
study heterogeneity using random effects models. 
Furthermore, we were unable to explore the impact of 
potential effect modifiers, such as age, sex, and other 
patient characteristics, and differences in surgical 
treatment, perioperative care, and rehabilitation 
between studies using meta-regression. Most studies 
focused on other clinical outcomes than revision 
surgery. They were not powered to detect differences 
in rates of revision surgery, with revision surgery often 
reported as a minor, even incidental, outcome. Other 
studies considered early failures as surgical failures 
and not implant failures, and excluded patients from 
further follow-up. Similar limitations have been noted 
previously.13
Our study highlights the shortcomings of the 
current evidence. Improving the quality of scientific 
reporting remains the main goal of the Core Outcome 
Measures in Effectiveness Trials (COMET)35 and 
similar initiatives across many specialties, including 
hip surgery,36 to increase the impact of primary study 
reports and systematic reviews and to inform good 
clinical practice. Although we were unable to analyse 
outcomes reported by the patients in our study, a 
moderate to high correlation between outcomes 
reported by clinicians and patients has been described 
previously.37 Joint pain and joint function reported 
by patients are now recognised as key outcomes of 
hip and knee replacement and have been widely 
collected in recent studies. Future studies should 
report core outcomes similar to those described in 
the Initiative on Methods, Measurement, and Pain 
Assessment in Clinical Trials (IMMPACT), which 
recommends reporting of pain, physical functioning, 
emotional functioning; participants’ ratings of global 
improvement, 
satisfaction 
with 
treatment, 
and 
disposition; and serious adverse events.38
Conclusion
Identifying the most appropriate implant combination 
for use in THR is a recognisable priority39 given 
the number of patients undergoing primary THR 
worldwide. Selection of implant combination type is 
determined by multiple factors: surgeon preference, 
such as surgical training and skills; patient factors, 
such as age and bone shape; healthcare provider 
factors, such as cost pressures on hospitals and 
availability of implant combinations; and ultimately 
the available evidence in the literature. Despite the 
large number of THRs performed annually worldwide, 
the number of implant combinations available on 
the market, and the number of studies performed by 
manufacturers comparing hip implants, there is still 
little evidence available to allow integration of results 
and inform decision making. Consequently, clinical 
practice and guidance relies on registry evidence, 
which is more prone to bias. This review highlights 
the need for new randomised controlled trials with 
rigorous reporting on core, adequately powered 
outcomes (possibly within an Idea, Development, 
Exploration, Assessment, Long-term study (IDEAL) 
collaboration40), to inform decision making. Our 
future work includes liaising with international 
collaborations 
for 
new 
multiarm 
randomised 
controlled trial comparisons of implant combinations. 
Our findings have implications for clinical practice, 
reassuring clinicians and patients that there is no 
evidence that newer implant combinations may 
be superior to metal-on-polyethylene implants, 
irrespective of head size and fixation technique.
