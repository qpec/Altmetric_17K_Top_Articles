SUMMARY
Although the adult mammalian spinal cord lacks
intrinsic neurogenic capacity, glial cells can be re-
programmed in vivo to generate neurons after spinal
cord injury (SCI). How this reprogramming process is
molecularly regulated, however, is not clear. Through
a series of in vivo screens, we show here that the
p53-dependent pathway constitutes a critical check-
point for SOX2-mediated reprogramming of resident
glial cells in the adult mouse spinal cord. While it has
no effect on the reprogramming efficiency, the p53
pathway promotes cell-cycle exit of SOX2-induced
adult neuroblasts (iANBs). As such, silencing of
either p53 or p21 markedly boosts the overall pro-
duction of iANBs. A neurotrophic milieu supported
by BDNF and NOG can robustly enhance maturation
of these iANBs into diverse but predominantly gluta-
matergic neurons. Together, these findings have un-
covered critical molecular and cellular checkpoints
that may be manipulated to boost neuron regenera-
tion after SCI.
INTRODUCTION
Severe morbidity and mortality are commonly associated with
spinal cord injury (SCI). Human patients who survive SCI
frequently live with paralysis and extremely reduced quality of
life and productivity. The financial and emotional burdens to
patients and their caregivers are enormous. There is currently
no effective cure. This is largely because SCI often results in a
permanent loss of neurons and the disruption of neural circuits
that are critical for normal motor, sensory, and autonomic func-
tions (Bradbury and McMahon, 2006; Rossignol et al., 2007;
Thuret et al., 2006).
Unlike discrete regions of the adult brain in which new neurons
are constantly born (Jessberger and Gage, 2014; Kempermann
et al., 2015; Lim and Alvarez-Buylla, 2016), the adult mammalian
spinal cord exhibits minimal regenerative capacity under physi-
ological and pathological conditions (Chi et al., 2006; Horky
et al., 2006; Horner et al., 2000; Shechter et al., 2007; Vessal
et al., 2007; Yang et al., 2006). Proliferative cells in the intact
adult spinal cord exclusively give rise to glial cells (Horner
et al., 2000). In response to SCI, astrocytes, ependymal cells,
NG2-glia, pericytes, fibroblasts, and microglia become acti-
vated, proliferate, migrate, and generate scar-forming glial cells
surrounding the damaged regions (Fitch and Silver, 2008; Go
¨ ritz
et al., 2011; Horky et al., 2006; Johansson et al., 1999; Ohori
et al., 2006; Sellers et al., 2009; Sofroniew, 2009). Injury-induced
neurogenesis in the adult spinal cord is extremely rare and new
neurons are not detectable in most cases (Horky et al., 2006; Jo-
hansson et al., 1999; Su et al., 2014). However, neurosphere-
forming cells can be isolated from the adult spinal cord and
show multi-lineage differentiation potential in vitro (Ohori et al.,
2006; Shihabuddin et al., 2000), suggesting that the fate of
certain resident non-neuronal cells may be manipulated for neu-
rogenesis in vivo. Indeed, growth factor treatment and ectopic
expression of NEUROG2 can stimulate endogenous neural pro-
genitors to produce neurons after SCI (Ohori et al., 2006). We and
others also have shown that resident glial cells, such as astro-
cytes and NG2 glia, can be in vivo reprogrammed to neurons
in the adult brain and spinal cord (Guo et al., 2014b; Heinrich
et al., 2014; Islam et al., 2015; Liu et al., 2015; Niu et al., 2013,
2015; Su et al., 2014; Torper et al., 2013, 2015).
In contrast to a direct reprogramming process controlled by
ectopic expression of NEUROD1 or other neurogenic factors
(Guo et al., 2014b; Liu et al., 2015; Torper et al., 2013, 2015),
SOX2-mediated in vivo reprogramming of brain astrocytes is
a multistep process that passes through ASCL1+ progenitors
and DCX+ neuroblasts before transitioning into mature neurons
(Niu et al., 2015). Both ASCL1 and the orphan nuclear receptor
TLX are critically involved in this process (Islam et al., 2015;
Niu et al., 2015). Importantly, SOX2-induced adult neuroblasts
(iANBs) can be similarly detected in the injured adult spinal
cord, even though the total number of iANBs and iANB-derived
mature neurons was low (Su et al., 2014). To understand the
reprogramming process and improve the production of iANBs
in the adult spinal cord, we modified several procedures and
screened a series of transcription factors and signaling mole-
cules. We found that the p53 pathway is a critical checkpoint

 that controls cell-cycle exit of iANBs. Downregulation of this
pathway leads to a significant increase in iANBs, which can
mature into both excitatory and inhibitory neurons in the pres-
ence of neurotrophic factors in the injured adult spinal cord.
RESULTS
The p53 Pathway Restricts the Generation of Spinal
iANBs
In contrast to robust generation of iANBs and adult-born neurons
in the striatum (Niu et al., 2013), SOX2-mediated reprogramming
in the adult spinal cord was less efficient, with only about 200
DCX+ cells detected surrounding the injected area at 4–8 weeks
post-injection (wpi) of virus (Su et al., 2014). We then conducted
a series of in vivo screens for factors that might potentiate
SOX2 reprogramming ability. Most of these screens, including
conditional deletion of Pten or ectopic expression of Pax6,
Neurog2, Ascl1, Sox11, Tlx, Pou5f1, Olig2, Ptf1a, Sox1, Sox3,
Brn2, NeuroD1, Fgf2, miR-9/9*, or miR-124, failed to significantly
enhance the appearance of iANBs.
Conditional removal of p53, on the other hand, greatly
enhanced the number of SOX2-induced iANBs, with about
1,500 DCX+ cells detected at 5 or 6 wpi (Figures S1A and
S1B). Very interestingly, the largest increase came from optimi-
zation of several procedures, such as improvements on SOX2 vi-
rus quality and injection methods. These optimizations led to the
detection of �10,000 DCX+ cells in the SOX2-alone-injected
spinal region at 4 wpi (Figure S1C). Even under this optimized
condition, additional genetic deletion of p53 continued to result
in a roughly 100% increase in the number of iANBs (Figures 1A
and 1B). This increase also was observed when p53 expression
was transiently downregulated by RNA polymerase II- and hu-
man GFAP promoter-dependent expression of p53 small hairpin
RNA (shRNA) (Figures 1C and S2A–S2D).
p21 is a major downstream target of p53. Its expression in as-
trocytes is also dependent on p53 (Figure S2E). To examine the
role of p21 in the reprogramming process, we injected SOX2-
expressing virus into the spinal cord of adult p21 knockout
(KO) mice. When examined at 4 wpi and compared to the wild-
type controls, the number of DCX+ cells was nearly doubled in
the p21 KO mice (Figures 1D and 1E). Together, these results
demonstrated a critical role of the p53-p21 pathway in control-
ling the SOX2-mediated generation of iANBs.
The p53 Pathway Promotes Cell Cycle Exit of Spinal
iANBs
In response to stresses or insults, p53 activation induces cell-
cycle arrest or apoptosis to safeguard cells from undergoing un-
controlled proliferation (Lane and Levine, 2010). We examined
iANB apoptosis by staining for activated caspase 3, and we
did not find a significant difference in the spinal cord with or
without p53 downregulation by shRNA or in p21 KO mice
when compared to wild-type controls (Figures S3A and S3B).
To further examine cell apoptosis, we performed terminal deox-
ynucleotidyl transferase (TdT) dUTP nick-end labeling (TUNEL)
assays. A few TUNEL+ cells were detected in spinal cords in-
jected with the lentivirus-expressing SOX2 and the control
shRNA or shRNA-p53, although none of them were DCX+ (Fig-
ures S3C and S3D). A small but significant increase of TUNEL+
cells was observed in the group with shRNA-p53 only at 3 wpi,
but not at 4 wpi, suggesting that downregulation of p53 did not
enhance cell survival.
During adult neurogenesis, DCX+ neuroblasts consist of both
early proliferating and later non-proliferating cells in the endoge-
nous neurogenic niches (Lugert et al., 2012). A fraction of iANBs
also was shown to be proliferative in the adult brain. We exam-
ined iANB proliferation in the adult spinal cord by staining for
KI67, a nuclear protein present in all phases of the cell cycle
but absent in quiescent cells (Scholzen and Gerdes, 2000). A
time course analysis showed that proliferation of SOX2-depen-
dent iANBs was significantly decreased from 20% at 1 wpi to
5% at 4 wpi in the wild-type spinal cord (Figure 2A). When p53
was conditionally deleted by Cre expression or downregulated
through shRNAs, a roughly 3-fold increase in proliferating
iANBs was observed when compared to controls at 4 wpi (Fig-
ures 2B–2D).
Similarly, immunohistochemistry analysis showed that p21
deletion resulted in a dramatic increase in proliferating iANBs,
from 5% in wild-type mice to nearly 30% in p21 KO mice (Figures
2E and 2F). To further characterize cell proliferation, we treated
mice with bromodeoxyuridine (BrdU)-containing drinking water
for 3 days starting at 3 wpi (Figure 2G). Over 90% of iANBs
were labeled by BrdU in adult p21 KO mice when examined at
4 wpi (Figure 2H). Cell-cycle exit of iANBs was determined by
quantifying the fraction of KI67+BrdU+DCX+ cells among the total
BrdU+DCX+ cells (Figure 2I). The p21 KO mice showed a 22.5%
increase in iANBs remaining in cell cycle compared to wild-type
controls (Figure 2J). Together these data show that the p53-p21
pathway tightly regulates iANB production by restricting prolifer-
ation and cell-cycle exit.
Reprogramming Efficiency Is Not Affected by the p53
Pathway
The p53 pathway was shown to be a roadblock during reprog-
ramming of somatic cells to pluripotency. Its silencing signifi-
cantly increases the reprogramming efficiency of fibroblasts to
pluripotent stem cells (Banito et al., 2009; Hanna et al., 2009;
Hong et al., 2009; Kawamura et al., 2009; Li et al., 2009; Mario
´ n
et al., 2009; Utikal et al., 2009). We examined whether the p53
pathway has a similar effect on SOX2-mediated in vivo reprog-
ramming efficiency, which may contribute to the overall produc-
tion of iANBs.
Our previous genetic lineage mapping showed that SOX2
initially reprograms astrocytes to ASCL1+ progenitors, which
further differentiate into DCX+ iANBs and mature neurons (Niu
et al., 2015). Therefore, the induction of ASCL1+ progenitors
can be used to estimate the in vivo reprogramming efficiency.
SOX2 virus was injected into the spinal cord of adult wild-type
or p21 KO mice, which were examined at 3 wpi. ASCL1+ cells
were robustly induced; however, no difference in their number
was detected between p21 KO and wild-type control mice (Fig-
ures 3A and 3B). KI67 staining and quantification also failed to
reveal any significant difference in progenitor proliferation be-
tween these groups (Figure 3C).
ASCL1+ progenitors gradually transited to early DCX+ neuro-
blasts, which expressed both markers (Figure 3D). Quantification
892
Cell Reports 17, 891–903, October 11, 2016
 of this ASCL1+DCX+ subgroup among all progenitors did not
reveal any influence by p21 deletion (Figure 3E). In contrast,
the ratio of ASCL1+DCX+ cells to total DCX+ cells was much
lower in the p21 KO group (Figure 3F), consistent with a dramatic
increase in DCX+ iANBs caused by silencing p21 (Figure 1E).
Together these results suggest that the p53 pathway does not
have a major impact on the induction of ASCL1+ progenitors,
their proliferation, or their transition to early DCX+ iANBs.
Spinal iANBs Are Halted at an Immature Stage
Further maturation of iANBs is important for functional integra-
tion within a neuronal network. As SOX2-mediated in vivo re-
programming passes through a proliferative stage, we used
BrdU in drinking water to trace the fate of iANBs (Figure 4A).
Mature neurons were identified by staining for RBFOX3 (also
known as NEUN), a marker tightly associated with neuron differ-
entiation and maturation (Mullen et al., 1992). When examined at
8 wpi, BrdU+RBFOX3+ cells were observed in SOX2 virus-in-
jected spinal regions of both wild-type and p21 KO mice (Figures
4B and 4C); however, quantification failed to show any increase
by silencing p21 expression.
A separate cohort of mice also was treated with valproic acid
(VPA) in drinking water for 4 weeks to promote neuronal matura-
tion (Figure 4A). Consistent with our previous results (Niu et al.,
2013; Su et al., 2014), VPA treatment resulted in nearly 6,000
BrdU+RBFOX3+ cells in SOX2 virus-injected spinal regions of
wild-type mice; however, this number of cells was not observed
in p21 KO mice (Figure 4C).
Such a low number of mature neurons in p21 KO mice might
be due to a loss of iANBs during the maturation process.

 Immunohistochemistry was conducted to determine whether
iANBs were detectable at 8 wpi. Unexpectedly, a significantly
larger number of DCX+ iANBs was still observed in mice with
p21 deletion (Figures 4D and 4E). Continuous VPA treatment in
drinking water showed a minimal effect on the number of iANBs.
Together these results indicate that iANBs, though robustly
generated, are halted at an immature state after silencing the
p53-p21 pathway.
A Neurotrophic Milieu Promotes the Maturation of
Spinal iANBs
During neural development, neurotrophic factors are critically
important for neuronal survival and maturation. A neurotrophic
milieu suitable for neuron maturation may not persist in the adult
spinal cord. By using a lentiviral delivery approach, we conduct-
ed a candidate screen for factors that might enhance the matu-
ration of SOX2-induced spinal iANBs. These included GDNF,
FGF2, BDNF, and NOG. Once again, continuous BrdU treat-
ments in drinking water were employed to trace adult-born neu-
rons, which were examined at 8 wpi (Figure 5A).
The presence of either GDNF or FGF2 increased the number of
BrdU+RBFOX3+ cells to roughly 6,000 in injected regions of the
p21 KO spinal cord, while these two factors had minimal effect
in the wild-type background (Figure 5B). On the other hand,
wild-type mice responded to treatment with BDNF-NOG and
showed about 7,000 BrdU+RBFOX3+ cells surrounding the
SOX2 virus-injected spinal regions. The p21 KO mice had
the most striking response to BDNF-NOG, with nearly 30,000

cells were also robustly detectable in the white matter where
the somas of endogenous neurons are not normally present
(Figure 5C). The effect of BDNF-NOG on iANB maturation also
was confirmed in wild-type mice with shRNA-mediated knock-

Treatments with BDNF-NOG also promoted BrdU+ new neu-
rons to express MAP2, another well-established marker for
mature neurons (Dehmelt and Halpain, 2005) (Figure 5E). Stain-
ing for SYN1, a presynaptic vesicle-associated protein, showed
punctate patterns in the processes and somas of adult-born
neurons, indicating synaptic connections with local neurons
(Figure 5F). Many of these new neurons could be detected in
the white matter, with potential to readily form circuits with
ascending and descending axons.

In the Thy1-STOP-YFP reporter line, yellow
fluorescent protein (YFP) expression is un-
der the neuron-specific regulator elements
of the mouse Thy1 promoter after Cre-
mediated removal of the STOP cassette
(Buffelli et al., 2003). The GcTy mice
showed weak but restricted YFP expres-
sion in spinal astrocytes (Figure S4). None-
theless, very few sparsely distributed YFP+
cells (<0.01%) were also RBFOX3+ found
in the dorsal horns, but not ventral regions
(Figure S4); we therefore limited our anal-
ysis to the ventral spinal cord to exclude
any potential contamination from endoge-
nous neurons. Reprogramming factors
were mainly delivered into the ventral spinal cord of adult GcTy
mice. Immunohistochemistry was performed at 8–24 wpi.
In GcTy mice, SOX2-reprogrammed DCX+ iANBs were
robustly labeled by YFP, confirming an astrocyte-origin (Fig-
ure 6B). Clustered YFP+ cells expressing markers for mature
neurons, such as MAP2 and RBFOX3, could be detected in
both the white matter and gray matter (Figures S5A and S5B).
These YFP+ cells were not observed in control virus-injected
GcTy mice. Over 99.9% of the YFP-traced neurons also robustly
expressed SYN1 with a punctate pattern (Figure S5C), indicating
synaptic connections with local neurons. An extensive survey of
neuronal subtypes showed astrocyte-converted neurons were
diverse, including GAD6+ and GABA+ GABAergic neurons (Fig-
ures 6C and S5D), GLYT2+ glycinergic neurons (Figure 6D),
5-HT+ serotonergic neurons (Figure 6E), VGLUT2+ glutamatergic
neurons (Figure 6F), CALB+ neurons (Figure 6G), and cholinergic
neurons (Figure 6H). Quantification showed that the predomi-
nant subtype was glutamatergic, which represented over 80%
of the reprogrammed neurons, while the other subtypes were
below 20% or rarely observed (Figure 6I).

were examined by RBFOX3 staining and
tdT fluorescence at 8 wpi. In control
virus-injected mice with contusion SCI,
RBFOX3+ neurons were detected in the
gray matter and none were labeled with
tdT, confirming the glial specificity of
the lineage-tracing reporter even under

tdT+RBFOX3+ cells were detected sur-
rounding the lesion core in mice injected
with the reprogramming factors (Figures
7C and 7D). The somas of many newly re-
programmed neurons were in the white
matter, a feature not observed for endog-
enous neurons.
DISCUSSION
A lack of neurogenesis in the adult spinal
cord may contribute to the failure of
functional recovery after SCI. We now provide a molecular and
cellular roadmap for robust generation of new spinal neurons
after a mild or severe contusion SCI. This entails removing an
inhibitory checkpoint during reprogramming of resident glial cells
to mature neurons in vivo (Figure 7E).

Cell Reports 17, 891–903, October 11, 2016
 The ectopic expression of SOX2 is sufficient to reprogram resi-
dent glial cells to neurons in the adult CNS (Heinrich et al., 2014;
Niu et al., 2013, 2015; Su et al., 2014). Nonetheless, the number
of reprogrammed neurons was low in the adult spinal cord (Su
et al., 2014). This urged a better understanding of the reprogram-
ming process and an improved strategy for the robust induction
of new spinal neurons essential to regeneration after SCI. Among
a score of factors examined in vivo, the p53-p21 pathway was
uniquely revealed to be an essential checkpoint for SOX2-medi-
ated reprogramming of spinal astrocytes in vivo. Silencing this

 pathway, either through genetic deletion or transient knock-
down, led to a significant increase in iANB generation, which
can further give rise to mature neurons in a neurotrophic milieu.
Although enhanced iANB production may elevate the risk of
tumorigenesis, we failed to detect any spinal tumors 15 months
after p53 was conditionally silenced. Consistent with our previ-
ous results showing the number of iANBs is greatly reduced in
a time-dependent manner (Niu et al., 2013), iANBs were rarely
observed when examined around 6 months post-virus injection
in the adult spinal cord. Additionally, transient inhibition of the
p53 pathway may be achieved by the small molecule inhibitor
Pifithrin-a (Komarov et al., 1999) or by AAV-mediated expression
of shRNAs.
The p53 pathway is activated by reprogramming factors and
acts as a roadblock to reprogramming somatic cells to pluripo-
tency. Silencing this pathway in culture can significantly increase
reprogramming efficiency for both the formation of induced
pluripotent stem cells and transdifferentiation of fibroblasts to
induced neurons (Banito et al., 2009; Guo et al., 2014a; Hanna
et al., 2009; Hong et al., 2009; Jiang et al., 2015; Kawamura
et al., 2009; Li et al., 2009; Mario
´ n et al., 2009; Utikal et al.,
2009; Zhao et al., 2008). In contrast, using the induction of
ASCL1+ progenitors to estimate reprogramming efficiency, we
showed that silencing the p53-p21 pathway has little effect on
the early steps of SOX2-mediated in vivo reprogramming. Both
the induction and proliferation of ASCL1+ progenitors were not
significantly affected by p21 deletion. These results may not
be unexpected, as we and others previously have shown that
p21 expression in neural stem/progenitor cells is normally sup-
pressed by robust expression of the orphan nuclear receptor
TLX (Li et al., 2012; Niu et al., 2011; Sun et al., 2007). Accompa-
nying naturally diminished TLX expression in DCX+ neuroblasts
(Li et al., 2012), p21 expression is increased in these cells and
in newly developing neurons (Pechnick et al., 2008). Consistent
with a positive role in cell-cycle exit, p21 deletion leads to greatly
increased proliferation of both endogenous and SOX2-induced
neuroblasts (Pechnick et al., 2008; this study). Together these
data indicate that SOX2-mediated in vivo reprogramming
passes through a multistep cellular process, which resembles
that of endogenous adult neurogenesis and is subject to a tight
molecular regulation.
A permissive microenvironment, also known as neurogenic
niche, is critical for neuronal survival and maturation during adult
neurogenesis in the lateral ventricle and dentate gyrus (Jess-
berger and Gage, 2014; Kempermann et al., 2015; Lim and
Alvarez-Buylla, 2016). The niche consists of not only cellular con-
texts and extracellular matrix but also secreted humoral factors.
Our results indicate that an appropriate niche is also critical for
further differentiation of iANBs into mature neurons in the other-
wise non-neurogenic adult spinal cord. Although silencing the
p53 pathway creates a large population of iANBs, only a fraction
can become mature under normal or injured conditions. Our
further in vivo screens revealed that locally secreted BDNF
and NOG constitute important niche factors supporting robust
generation of newly mature spinal neurons from iANBs. These
induced neurons are often in clusters and can be established
in both the white matter and gray matter. Such broader and
clustered distribution may provide more opportunities for the
induced neurons to form connections between themselves,
with preexisting local neurons, and with descending and
ascending spinal axons. Although a detailed electrophysiolog-
ical analysis is needed for confirmation, the robust detection of
punctate SYN1 expression in induced neurons is indicative of
their ability to form synaptic connections.
The local microenvironment and/or intrinsic properties of
the originating resident astrocytes also are instructive for the
formation of region-specific neuronal subtypes from astrocyte-
converted iANBs. iANBs in the adult spinal cord do not generate
CR+ GABAergic interneurons, which are the major subtype of
induced neurons in the adult striatum (Niu et al., 2015). In
contrast, VGLUT2+ glutamatergic neurons are the predominant
subtype of induced neurons in the adult spinal cord. Endoge-
nous VGLUT2+ neurons are distributed throughout the spinal
gray matter (Llewellyn-Smith et al., 2007). They recently were
shown to be essential components of the locomotor circuitry
and to play an essential role for proper organization of the spinal
locomotor network (Borgius et al., 2014). As such, it is conceiv-
able that the iANB-generated VGLUT2 excitatory neurons may
well be capable of forming relay circuits with ascending and
descending motor pathways, which are frequently disrupted by
SCI (Abematsu et al., 2010; Courtine et al., 2008). Such relays,
if confirmed, may contribute to functional motor recovery after
SCI. In addition to glutamatergic neurons, 10%–20% of the
induced neurons are GABAergic, glycinergic, or serotonergic.
These neuronal subtypes are thought to be essential in coordi-
nating muscle activation during locomotion (Nishimaru and Kaki-
zaki, 2009).
Our ability to successfully produce a large population of long-
lived and diverse subtypes of new neurons in the adult spinal
cord provides a cellular basis for regeneration-based therapy
for SCI. Compared to cell transplantation-based approaches,
in vivo reprogrammed neurons from resident glial cells are im-
mune homologous to the host. Therefore, the reprogrammed
neurons will not require immune suppression for survival and
integration into the local neuronal network. Future studies are
warranted to investigate their biological function after SCI.
EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURES
Animals
Wild-type C57BL/6J mice and the following mutant mouse lines were obtained
from The Jackson Laboratory: Ptenflox (stock 004597) (Groszer et al., 2001),
p53flox (stock 008462) (Marino et al., 2000), p21 KO (stock 003263) (Brugarolas
et al., 1995), mGfap-Cre line 77.6 (stock 024098) (Gregorian et al., 2009), Thy1-
STOP-YFP (stock 005630) (Buffelli et al., 2003), and Rosa-tdT (stock 007914)
(Madisen et al., 2010). Unless otherwise stated, both male and female mice
at 8 weeks and older were used for all experiments. All mice were housed un-
der a controlled temperature and a 12-hr light/dark cycle, with free access to
water and food, in an animal facility at University of Texas (UT) Southwestern.
The sample sizes were empirically determined. The experiments were not ran-
domized and the researchers were not blinded to the allocation of animals dur-
ing experiments and outcome assessment. All experimental procedures and
protocols were approved by the Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee
at UT Southwestern.
Virus Preparation and Intraspinal Injection
Lentivirus was used to deliver SOX2, GFP-T2A-Cre, Bdnf, Nog, shRNA, and
the other listed genes into the adult spinal cord, as previously described (Niu
900
Cell Reports 17, 891–903, October 11, 2016
 et al., 2013; Su et al., 2014). Gene expression was under the control of a modi-
fied human GFAP promoter, which was shown to mainly target astrocytes in
the mouse spinal cord (Su et al., 2014). Briefly, the third-generation replica-
tion-deficient lentivirus was generated by transient transfections of HEK293T
cells with lentiviral vectors together with the packaging plasmids (pMDL,
VSV-G, and pREV). The virus-containing culture supernatants were collected
and concentrated by centrifugation. Viral titers were estimated by quantifying
GFP-expressing cells or by immunofluorescence staining of virus-transduced
U251 glioma cells at 72 hr after viral infection. Using a 5-ml Hamilton syringe
and a 34-gauge, 18-degree-beveled needle (Hamilton), 1.5 ml lentivirus
(0.5–1 3 109 pfu/mL) was manually injected into the spinal parenchyma at
each of the two locations 2 mm apart at the T8 level. The injection rate was
maintained at 0.3 mL/min, and 1 min was taken to slowly withdraw the needle
upon completion of the injection.
BrdU and VPA Administration
When appropriate, mice were administered BrdU (B5002, Sigma; 0.5 g/L)
and/or VPA (P4543, Sigma; 4 g/L) in drinking water for the indicated duration.
Contusion Spinal Cord Injury
Adult mice were anesthetized and a laminectomy was performed at the T7–9
segments. The exposed spinal cord was subjected to a contusion injury that
was introduced by using the IH impactor (Precision Systems and Instrumenta-
tion) with a 1-mm tip and a force of 60 kdyn.
Immunohistochemistry
Mice were euthanized and perfused with intracardial injection of 4% (w/v)
paraformaldehyde in PBS. Spinal cords were isolated and post-fixed over-
night with 4% (w/v) paraformaldehyde at 4�C. After cryoprotection with
30% sucrose in PBS for 48 hr at 4�C, transverse sections or 1.5-cm longitu-
dinal sections of spinal cords spanning the injection/injury sites were
collected on a cryostat (Leica) set at 20-mm thickness. The primary anti-
bodies used for immunofluorescence are listed in Table S1. When mouse
primary antibodies were used, tissue sections were pretreated to block
non-specific staining. Specifically, the sections were incubated with 50%
formamide in 13 saline sodium citrate (SSC) buffer for 1.5 hr at 65�C. For
BrdU staining, the sections were pretreated with 2 N HCl for 30 min at
37�C. The corresponding secondary antibodies conjugated with Alexa Fluor
488, 555, or 647 dye (Jackson ImmunoResearch Laboratories) were applied
at 1:2,000 dilution for indirect fluorescence. Nuclei were counterstained with
Hoechst 33342 (Hst). Images were captured and examined by using a Zeiss
LSM 700 confocal microscope.
TUNEL Assay
TUNEL assay was performed on cryostat sections by using the R&D Systems
TACS TdT In Situ Apoptosis Detection Kit (Fisher Scientific). TUNEL-positive
controls were set up with TACS-Nuclease provided in the kit. All TUNEL-pos-
itive cells surrounding the injection area were counted on each section.
Statistical Analysis
The quantification data were expressed as mean ± SD from four to six mice.
Statistical analysis was performed by ANOVA and Tukey’s post hoc multiple
comparisons or the unpaired Student’s t tests where appropriate. Differences
were considered statistically significant at p < 0.05.
