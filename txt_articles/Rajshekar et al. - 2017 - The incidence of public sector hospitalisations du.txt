og bites have long been identified 
as a potential source of serious 
injury to humans,1 and injuries 
due to dog bites are a largely unrecognised 
and growing public health problem. The 
public health implications of dog bites 
are substantial, and verifying the extent 
of the problem is important.2 The serious 
health-related consequences of injuries 
sustained due to dog bites include open 
wounds, cellulitis, and fractures leading to 
temporary or permanent disability, mental 
trauma, anxiety and premature mortality. 
The economic consequences include use 
of medical resources, lost productivity of 
victims and their carers, and time and effort 
expended by the wide range of personnel 
involved in apprehending and dealing with 
the offending animal including court cases 
involving the victim, the victim’s family and 
the owner of the offending dog. The social 
consequences include inter-personal disputes 
and community conflict. 
There is limited, incomplete and fragmented 
information on dog bites in Australia due 
to the lack of a comprehensive reporting 
system.3,4 The National Coronial Information 
System5 produced a fact sheet on animal-
related deaths of humans in Australia 
between July 2000 and November 2010. It 
highlighted that, on average, 1–2 persons 
died due to dog bites each year. The 
Australian Companion Animal Council Inc. has 
estimated that more than 100,000 persons 
in Australia are attacked by dogs each year, 
with an estimated 12,000–14,000 individuals 
requiring treatment for dog bite injuries, 
and around 10% of those being hospitalised 
each year.3 This may be an underestimate 
of the rates of hospitalisation because, in 
the only national compilation of data that 
was published in 2005,6 an average of 2,184 
persons each year were found to require 
hospitalisation during 2001–03. The authors 
of the national report used the ICD-10-AM 
W54 code to estimate the incidence of 
injuries due to dog bites. That code included 
other injuries due to being struck by dogs 
(injuries from falls due to being knocked over 
by dogs). In 2002–03, ICD-10-AM w54 was 
sub-classified into ICD-10-AM W54.0 to record 
dog bite injuries, and ICD-10-AM W54.8 to 
record injuries due to being struck by dogs 
respectively. To date, this has not been 
succeeded by another national report that 
has reported the incidence of hospitalisations 
due to injuries from dog bites using the 
revised ICD-10AM W54.0 code. 
A position paper by the Royal Australasian 
College of Surgeons in 20127 on dog bites in 
Australia recommended updating the current 
data and investing in further research on the 
epidemiology of dog-related injury including 
dog bites. To address this paucity of recent 
data, this study investigated the incidence,

Abstract
Objective: To estimate the incidence of dog bite-related injuries requiring public sector 
hospitalisation in Australia during the period 2001–13. 
Methods: Summary data on public sector hospitalisations due to dog bite-related injuries with 
an ICD 10-AM W54.0 coding were sourced from the Australian Institute of Health and Welfare 
for the study period 2001–2013. 
Results: In Australia, on average, 2,061 persons were hospitalised each year for treatment for 
dog bite injuries at an annual rate of 12.39 (95%CI 12.25-12.53) per 100,000 during 2001–13. 
The highest annual rates of 25.95 (95%CI 25.16-26.72) and 18.42 (95%CI 17.75-19.07) per 
100,000 were for age groups 0-4 and 5-9 years respectively. Rates of recorded events increased 
over the study period and reached 16.15 (95%CI 15.78-16.52) per 100,000 during 2011–13. 
Conclusion: Dog bites are a largely unrecognised and growing public health problem in 
Australia. 
Implications for public health: There is an increasing public sector burden of hospitalisations 
for injuries from dog bites in Australia. 
Key words: Public health, dog bites, dog bite injury, hospitalisations from dog bites, dog bite 
incidence in Australia

and trends in incidence, of hospitalisation due 
to dog bites in Australia during the period 
2001–13.
Method
Data Sources
Summary data on hospitalisations due to 
dog bite-related injuries with an ICD-10-AM 
(WHO International Statistical Classification 
of Diseases and Related Health Problems, 
Tenth Revision, Australian Modification) code 
w54.0 (external cause of injury code) for 
public hospitals in each Australian state or 
territory during 2001–13 were sourced from 
the Australian Institute of Health and Welfare. 
The data were provided in biennial (July 
2001–June 2003, July 2003–June 2005…. July 
2011–June 2013) and sex-specific totals for 
age-groups 0–4, 5–9, 10–14, 15–24, 25–34, 
35–44, 45–54, 55–64, 65–74 and 75+ years. 
Data for Tasmania, ACT and Northern Territory 
were combined due to small cell counts in 
some age and sex categories. 
Additional data from injury surveillance units 
and health department registries of each 
state and territory of Australia were used for 
state-based analyses. Mid-year estimates 
of the population of Australia in five year 
age groups and sex-specific categories 
were sourced from the Australian Bureau of 
Statistics online resources.8 
The study was approved by the Tasmanian 
Health and Medical Human Research Ethics 
Committee (HREC no H0013594).
Data analysis
The population estimates were aggregated 
to match the year, age and jurisdictional 
groupings in which AIHW hospitalisation 
data were provided for each sex. Estimates of 
incidence density were calculated by dividing 
the number of hospitalisations due to dog 
bite-related injuries of persons of each sex 
in each year/age/jurisdictional grouping by 
the sex-specific population estimate for that 
grouping. Ninety-five per cent confidence 
intervals for the incidence density were 
based on a normal approximation with 
the standard error of the logarithm of the 
incidence density estimated as the square 
root of the inverse of the number of cases. 
Trends in sex-specific incidence density were 
estimated by Poisson regression of the mean 
number of hospitalisations in each age/
jurisdictional grouping of the midpoint of 
each year grouping and binary (0/1) terms for 
each age and jurisdictional grouping other 
than the reference category, and with the 
logarithm of the sex-specific population of 
the age/jurisdictional grouping entered as 
an offset. Quadratic terms in the mid-point of 
each year groupings were included to capture 
non-linearities.
Results
During the 12-year study period, 31,218 
persons (17,049 males and 14,169 females) 
were hospitalised for treatment for dog bite 
injuries, at an average annual rate of 2601 
per year and 12.39 (95%CI 12.25–12.53) per 
100,000 person years. 
Age-and sex-specific incidence density
The highest rates of hospitalisations due to 
injuries from dog bites were 25.95 (95%CI 
25.17–26.73) recorded for 0–4 year olds, 
followed by 18.41 (95%CI 17.75–19.07) for 
5–9 year olds. The lowest rates were 7.99 
(95%CI 7.69–8.29) per 100,000 for 15–24 year 
olds. Rates for persons aged 45+ years were 
generally stable at 12.11 (95%CI 11.89–12.33) 
per 100,000. Table 1 presents age-and sex-
specific estimates of incidence density for the 
study period 2001–13. In each age category 
prior to 45–54 years, the number of cases 
among males exceeded the number among 
females, and male rates for hospitalisations 
due to injuries from dog bites were higher 
than female rates. This male: female disparity 
was not continued at older ages.
Rates were generally similar among adults 
commencing with 25–34 year olds, but the 
numbers of cases peaked for 25–34, 35–44 
and 45–54 year olds and were similar to the 
number of cases among 0–4 year olds. 
Biennial incidence and incidence 
density
The biennial estimates of incidence and 
incidence density of hospitalisation due to 
injuries from dog bites in Australia during 
2001–03 were 11.50 (95%CI 11.16–11.84) per 
100,000 males and females combined. Rates 
increased from 10.28 (95%CI 9.96–10.59) 
per 100,000 during 2003–05, the low point 
of the period, to 13.63 (95%CI 13.29–13.98) 
per 100,000 during 2011–13 for both sexes 
combined. Rates rose progressively after 
2001–03, with a more substantial increase 
after 2009. The increase in rates after 2001–03 
is closely approximated by a quadratic trend 
on the logarithmic scale (Figure 1).
State and territory incidence density
Of all Australian states and territories, the 
lowest rates of 11.64 (95%CI (11.31–11.97) 
per 100,000 and 9.57 (95%CI 9.27–9.87) per 
100,000 respectively for males and females 
were recorded in NSW, followed by 11.68 
(95%CI 10.99–12.37) and 10.21 (95%CI 
9.57–10.85) per 100,000 respectively for males 
and females in SA. The highest rates of 22.2 
(21.04–23.36) per 100,000 and 18.20 (17.15–
19.25) per 100,000 for males and females 
respectively were recorded for TAS/ACT/NT. 
These analyses were solely based on AIHW 
data. The highest rates of 44.64 (41.66, 47.61) 
were recorded for Northern Territory, followed

by 18.75 (95%CI 17.22–20.27) for the ACT 
and 12.82 (95%CI 11.76–3.87) for Tasmania. 
For this analysis, data from injury surveillance 
units and data registries of individual states 
and territories have been used.
National age-specific trends in 
incidence density
Figure 2 presents trends in age-specific 
incidence density for 2001–13. The incidence 
density for persons aged 0–4 years or 5–9 
years remained roughly stable, but a steady 
increase in rates was observed for all other 
age groups after 2003. In sex specific analysis 
of persons aged 10+ years, the downturn in 
2003–05 was more pronounced for males 
than females (data not shown).
Discussion
This study has identified a number of patterns 
in the statistical data for dog bite injuries in 
contemporary Australia. On average each 
year between 2001 and 2013, 2601 persons 
required hospitalisation for dog bite injuries 
in Australia at an annual rate of 12.39 per 
100,000. The highest incidence density was 
for infants and children aged 0–4 years and 
the next highest was for 5–9 year olds. Rates 
for males were higher than those for females 
for all age groups prior to 45–54 years. Since 
2003, there has been a 57% increase in rates 
that reached 16.15 per 100,000 per year in 
2011–13. Of all states and territories, the 
highest rates were recorded in the Northern 
Territory. While one would expect growth in 
the Australian population (now more than 24 
million) over time to give a steady rise in the 
head count of injured people, the concerning 
aspect is the rising incidence density. 
The high incidence and incidence density 
for 0–4 and 5–9 year olds are consistent 
with findings of previous national6 and 
jurisdictional reports.1,9-11 Children are 
considered to be at a greater risk of dog 
bites due to their inexperienced handling of 
animals,12 their innate curiosity,12-14 and their 
inability to defend themselves against an 
animal attack15 due to their small stature.6
The excess of male cases in each age 
category of persons younger than 45 years is 
consistent with findings from international 
studies,12-16 that have reported higher rates 
of hospitalisation due to dog bites among 
males. This has been attributed to the greater 
prevalence of ownership of dogs by men 
(particularly younger men), the inclination of 
males to be daring and aggressive with dogs, 
Figure 2: Age-specific trends in incidence density, 2001-13.
a predisposition of men to be occupied in 
professions such as post-carriers, utility meter 
readers and door-to-door sales persons that 
have a greater exposure to dog bites.15
There are some differences between the 
estimates of incidence for 2001–03 provided 
in the national report6 and our estimates. 
Most notably, the national report provided 
estimates for 75+ year-olds during 2001–03 
were about 20% higher than our own. About 
half the cases in that age category during that 
period were due to being struck by dogs.6 
The differences in rates between the national 
report and our data may be due to the use of 
WHO ICD classification code ICD-10-AM W54 
prior to July 2002. The coding transition from 
ICD-10-AM W54 to ICD-10-AM W54.0 resulted 
in restriction to dog bites as the primary 
cause of injury requiring hospitalisation, and 
exclusion of injuries from being struck by 
dogs. This change is likely to be responsible 
also for the lower incidence density we have 
reported for 2003–05 than for 2001–03. The 
more pronounced downturn in rates for 
males than females between 2001–03 and 
2003–05 would be explained if males are 
more often struck by dogs than females. 
The longer-term trends in dog bite injuries 
and their underlying driving factors are 
worthy of comment. The initial decline was 
followed by a steady increase of 5.9% on 
average over the remainder of the study 
period. This pattern was mirrored by increases 
in age-specific rates for each age category 
of persons aged 15 years and older, but 
was not replicated for 0–14 year olds. The 
stability in rates of young children relative 
to those of older individuals may be due to 
the introduction of successful national and 
jurisdictional dog bite prevention initiatives10 
such as Delta Dog safe™, the AVA Pets and 
People Education Program and SPOT (Safe 
pets out there) amongst others.17 These 
programs have generally targeted junior and 
primary school children.
The increases occurred despite the 
introduction of the Domestic Animal Act, 
the Animal Welfare Act and the Animal 
Management Act in individual states and 
territories between 1985 and 2008, and of 
breed-specific legislation in some states 
and territories between 2004 and 2009. The 
Acts provided guidelines for responsible 
ownership/registration of dogs and 
prescribed penalties for dog-related offenses. 
Breed-specific legislation identified particular 
breeds of dogs as being dangerous, and 
placed restrictions on breeding, handling 
and ownership of breeds of dogs18 that could 
cause serious injury.
The increasing rates were not isolated to 
specific states. In general, the overall trends 
were replicated in each state and territory 
during the study period. The nature of the 
data for TAS/ACT/NT supplied by AIHW did 
not permit rates for the Northern Territory, 
 380

ACT and Tasmania to be calculated separately. 
For this purpose, data sourced from data 
registries and injury surveillance units were 
used. The results showed that the Northern 
Territory – the jurisdiction with the highest 
proportion of households exposed to stray 
dogs19 had the highest rates. The next highest 
rates were recorded in the ACT, followed by 
Queensland. The lowest rates were for NSW. 
There is very limited information available 
on rates of dog ownerships in each state and 
territory20 with which to investigate whether 
the jurisdictional differences in rates can be 
attributed to jurisdictional differences in dog-
ownership. 
Several factors may have contributed to the 
overall increase in rates during the study 
period. First, there has been an increase in 
the number of households with dogs. It 
is estimated that about 39% of Australian 
households now own a dog.20 The Australian 
Bureau of Statistics online resources indicate 
that married couples with dependants were 
most likely to have pets, with 49% of those 
households owning a dog.19 This heightened 
exposure to dogs as a result of increase in 
households with dogs may have contributed 
to the increase in rates over time. Also, 
an increased awareness of the infectious 
ramifications of dog bites,21 and increasing 
use of surgical procedures to repair damage 
due to dog bites,22 may have contributed to 
more individuals being treated in Australian 
hospitals than in previous years.
This study adds considerably to what is 
known regarding the public health problem 
of dog bite injuries in Australia. It is the first 
national study to report the incidence of 
hospitalisation for injuries due to dog bites for 
an extended period with complete coverage 
of all public hospitals in Australian states 
and territories. The previous national study 
covered only a three-year period. Because 
the present study is based on the revised 
ICD-10-AM W54.0 classification (July 2002), it 
is able to distinguish between injuries from 
being struck by dogs and injuries due to dog 
bites. Furthermore, the restriction to injuries 
sufficiently serious to require hospitalisation 
provides a strong focus on important and 
significant injuries and ensures that the 
data were based on a distinct criterion 
(hospitalisation). 
Some limitations of this study must be 
acknowledged. There was no coverage of 
dog bites not treated in public hospitals. An 
unknown proportion of dog bites resulting in 
injuries would have been treated in general 
medical practice, community health centres, 
and in private hospitals. Our estimates 
therefore under-state the extent of the 
problem. The trend data would be unreliable 
if there has been a systematic shift to or 
from treatment in general practice or private 
hospitals during the study period. During 
2000–01 to 2009–10, presentations to public 
hospital emergency departments increased 
by 1.8% per year.23 A Commonwealth 
Government funding initiative was 
introduced after 2011 to increase the number 
of short-stay units to accommodate these 
increasing presentations at the public 
hospital emergency departments.24,25 
Because this increase in numbers of short-
stay units occurred during the later stages of 
our study period, it could not be responsible 
for the earlier increases. Furthermore, without 
comprehensive data on dog registrations 
across Australia, it is not possible to track 
precisely trends in the rate of increase in dog 
ownerships or the increase in ownership of 
specific breeds of dogs. This study provides 
aggregate level data on the incidence of 
hospitalisation due to injuries from dog bites 
in Australia for an extended period, thereby 
addressing the critical lack of information on 
this public health problem. Finally, it was not 
possible to provide sex-specific estimates for 
Tas./ACT/NT due to the aggregated nature of 
the data supplied by the AIHW.
In conclusion, there is an increasing public 
sector burden of hospitalisations for injuries 
from dog bites in Australia. This study showed 
that persons aged 0–4 and 5–9 years had the 
highest rates of hospitalisation. Prevention 
initiatives targeting children may have 
warded off the increases in rates experienced 
by those aged 15 years or greater, which 
occurred despite breed-specific legislation 
in Australia to regulate breeding and 
ownership of dangerous dogs. Uniform and 
more complete surveillance of injuries and 
hospitalisations due to dog bites and dog 
ownership would provide evidence for the 
development of improved public policy in 
respect of dog bites.
