IMPORTANCE The randomized clinical trials comparing nonvitamin K antagonist oral
anticoagulants (NOACs) vs warfarin largely focused on recruiting high-risk patients with atrial
fibrillation with more than 2 stroke risk factors, with only the trials testing dabigatran or
apixaban including few patients with 1 stroke risk factor. Despite this, regulatory approvals of
all NOACs have been based on stroke prevention for patients with atrial fibrillation with 1 or
more stroke risk factors.
OBJECTIVE To compare the effectiveness and safety study of standard-dose NOACs
(dabigatran at 150 mg twice daily, rivaroxaban at 20 mg once daily, and apixaban at 5 mg
twice daily) and warfarin in patients with atrial fibrillation with 1 low-risk, nonsex-related
stroke risk factor.
DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS This nationwide observational cohort study used data
from Danish registries to determine the inverse probability of treatment-weighted
comparative effectiveness and safety of standard-dose NOACs (dabigatran at 150 mg twice
daily, rivaroxaban at 20 mg once daily, and apixaban at 5 mg twice daily) compared with
treatment with warfarin among 14 020 patients with atrial fibrillation with 1 low-risk, nonsex-
related stroke risk factor.
MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES Rates of ischemic stroke/systemic embolism, death, and
bleeding.
RESULTS Of 14 020 participants, 5151 (36.7%) were women, and the median age for
participants was 66.5 years. For the principal effectiveness end point of ischemic
stroke/systemic embolism, no significant differences of the NOACs compared with treatment
with warfarin across strata were evident. For the end point of “
any bleeding,”this was
significantly lower for treatment with apixaban (hazard ratio [HR], 0.35; 95% CI, 0.17-0.72)
and dabigatran (HR, 0.48; 95% CI, 0.30-0.77) compared with warfarin in the main analysis,
and was not significantly different for treatment with rivaroxaban vs warfarin (HR, 0.84; 95%
CI, 0.49-1.44). There was broad consistency across most subgroups in the sensitivity analyses
and whether 1- or 2.5-year follow-up periods were analyzed. However, falsification end points
generally did not falsify, indicating the possible presence of residual confounding across these
comparisons, presumably related to selective prescribing and unobserved covariates.
CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE In this Danish cohort study of patients with atrial fibrillation
and a single stroke risk factor, there was no difference between NOACs compared with
treatment with warfarin in terms of the risk of having an ischemic stroke/systemic embolism.
For “
any bleeding,”this was lower for treatment with apixaban and dabigatran compared with
warfarin. These data do not allow for a definitive statement of the comparative effectiveness
or safety of NOACs because of the possible residual confounding that was unmasked with
falsification outcomes.

n the respective randomized clinical trials of nonvitamin
K antagonist oral anticoagulants (NOACs) for stroke pre-
vention in atrial fibrillation (AF), the focus was on recruit-
ingpatientswithAFwith2ormorestrokeriskfactors,andonly
the trials testing treatment with dabigatran or apixaban in-
cluded a minority of patients with 1 stroke risk factor.1,2 To our
knowledge, specific randomized clinical trials including pa-
tients with AF with only 1 stroke risk factor have not been per-
formed, and there is a low likelihood for such trials to be
conducted. The objective of this study was to investigate the
comparative effectiveness and safety of standard-dose
NOACs (dabigatran at 150 mg twice daily, rivaroxaban at 20 mg
once daily, and apixaban at 5 mg twice daily) compared with
treatment with warfarin among such patients in the Danish
registries.
Methods
We conducted an observational cohort study of Danish citi-
zens initiating OAC treatment for stroke prevention in AF with
1 stroke risk factor. To align with previous randomized clini-
cal trials, we focused on standard-dose NOAC agents only
and used Danish nationwide databases (eMethods in the
Supplement).3-5
The study was based on new users of OACs with no his-
tory of treatment for other indications than AF. For this analy-
sis, we only recruited patients with 1 nonsex-related stroke risk
factor that was assigned 1 point in the CHA2DS2-VASc score (ie,
congestive heart failure or left ventricular disease, hyper-
tension, 65 years ≤ age <75 years, and diabetes or vascular
diseases such as myocardial infarction, aortic plaque or
peripheral aortic disease), thus excluding patients with prior
strokes, systemic embolisms/transient ischemic attacks, or
those who were younger than 75 years.
Nonvitamin K antagonist oral anticoagulants were re-
stricted to standard doses: apixaban at 5 mg twice daily, dabi-
gatran at 150 mg twice daily, and rivaroxaban at 20 mg once
daily. To establish an OAC-naive cohort, we excluded pa-
tients previously treated with OAC-inclusive doses approved
for other indications within 1 year. Eventually, we excluded pa-
tients with prior diagnoses of valvular AF or a venous throm-
boembolism. Also, patients with contraindications for stan-
dard NOAC dose regimens because of renal impairment were
excluded. This population formed the main cohort for the
analyses. Sensitivity analyses were reported on the subgroup
with prior diagnoses of AF. To increase homogeneity6 across
patient groups, we also performed a sensitivity analysis in
which patients with prior heart failure, chronic pulmonary dis-
ease, or cancer were excluded.
End Points and Variable Definitions
Clinical end points were extracted from hospital discharge
codes with follow-up until April 30, 2016 (eTable 1 in the
Supplement). Primary and secondary discharge codes from
nonemergency wards were extracted. We only analyzed end
points obtained as discharge codes from hospitalizations and
did not include codes from ambulatory visits.
Efficiency was investigated by the occurrence of ischemic
stroke or systemic embolism. All-cause death was included as
a lone end point. The safety of the treatments was investigated
by the following bleeding events: intracranial, gastrointesti-
nal, traumatic intracranial, and clinically relevant nonmajor
bleeding reported in total as “any bleeding” and more specifi-
cally for intracranial (including traumatic) and gastrointesti-
nal bleeding (see eTable 1 in the Supplement for International
Statistical Classification of Diseases and Related Health Prob-
lems, Tenth Revision [ICD-10] discharge codes).7,8
A patient’
s baseline comorbidities and comedications
when treatment was initiated were ascertained (Table 1)
(eTable 1 in the Supplement). The overall risk of bleeding
was assessed by the hypertension, abnormal renal and liver
function, stroke, bleeding, labile international normalized
ratio, elderly, drugs or alcohol (HAS-BLED) score (eTable 2 in
the Supplement).9 The Danish registries are well-validated
with a sufficiently high positive predictive value (>80%) of
included comorbidities and outcomes.10
Statistical Analysis
A time to event analysis was used to compare the risk of an end
point between treatment groups, measuring risk time from the
patient receiving their initial prescription and until the rel-
evant event, emigration, death, or end of follow-up (which-
ever came first). An intent-to-treat approach was applied for
the main analyses. This was supplemented by a continuous
treatmentanalysisbycensoringthefollow-upifthepatientwas
prescribed another treatment than what was initiated.
Crude incidence rates were calculated as the number of
events divided by the person-time. Cox regressions with a
robust variance estimator were used to compare event rates
between the treatment groups, with warfarin as the primary
reference. To address confounding by indication of treat-
ment, an inverse probability of treatment weighted (IPTW)
analysis was applied.11,12 We used weights that enabled esti-
mates representing mean population treatment effects. The
Key Points
Question What is the effectiveness and safety study of
standard-dose nonvitamin K antagonist oral anticoagulants
(NOACs) and warfarin among patients with atrial fibrillation with 1
stroke risk factor?
Findings In this nationwide observational cohort study, no
significant differences of the NOACs compared with warfarin
across strata were evident for the principal effectiveness end point
of ischemic stroke/systemic embolism. The end point of “
any
bleeding”was significantly lower for patients treated with
apixaban and dabigatran and not significantly different for
patients treated with rivaroxaban vs warfarin; however, there was
possible residual confounding across these comparisons that was
unmasked with falsification outcomes.
Meaning Our data show no significant differences of the NOACs
compared with treatment with warfarin for ischemic
stroke/systemic embolism, but for “
any bleeding,”this was lower
for treatment with apixaban and dabigatran.

 underlying propensity models included the following treat-
ment predictors: age (continuous); binary indicators for sex,
prior bleeding, vascular disease, hypertension, diabetes,
renal disease, chronic pulmonary disease, heart failure, can-
cer, and a recent prescription for aspirin, β-blockers, nonste-
roidal anti-inflammatory drugs, statins, or loop diuretics;
and the HAS-BLED score.
Balances between treatment populations were evaluated
bythestandardizeddifferencesofallbaselinecovariates,using
a threshold of 0.1 to indicate an imbalance.13
To evaluate the potential for residual confounding,
falsification analysis was performed by applying the
propensity–weighted cohort in the analyses on (falsifica-
tion) end points that a priori should be expected not to be
associated with the effects of treatment.14 For this study, we
considered pneumonia, hip fractures, cancer, and urinary
tract infections.
We repeated the analyses on the subgroup with a hospi-
tal discharge diagnosis for AF either before or within 30 days
of first receiving a prescription. In addition, as there may be
confounding because of differences in the health status of pa-
tients, we also reported results of analyses in which patients
withhigh-mortalityconditions(heartfailure,cancer,orchronic
pulmonary disorder) at the time treatment was initiated were
excluded. Eventually, the results of the IPTW analysis were
compared with a trimmed analysis that removed 5% of the ex-
treme weights as well as with an ordinary crude and adjusted
analysis (data not shown).

 The analyses on the entire population were supple-
mented by stratified analyses on the populations with 1 of the
frequent risk factors who were older than 65 and patients with
hypertension; additionally, the results of the analyses were re-
ported for men and women separately. Stata/MP, version 14
(StataCorp) and R version 3.1.1 (The R Foundation) were used
for the statistical analysis. A 2-tailed P value of less than .05
was considered statistically significant.
Ethical Considerations
No ethical approval is required for anonymous register stud-
ies in Denmark. The study was approved by the Danish Data
Protection Agency (J. No. File No. 2012-41-0633).
Results
We identified 240 360 unique OAC users in the inclusion
period, 59% of whom (n = 142 307) either prevalently used
vitamin K antagonists or had an indication for treatment
because of other reasons than nonvalvular AF. Of the
remaining OAC users (n = 98 053), we excluded 22%
(n = 21 456) because of treatment with reduced-dose NOACs
or because of the presence of prior discharge codes for renal
impairment. Thus, the study population covers 76 597 new
users of OAC treatment for AF, with either standard-dose
NOACs or warfarin. Of these, 82% (n = 62 577) were excluded
because they had either 0 or more than 1 nonsex-related
stroke risk factor or because their risk factors had scored a
2-point CHA2DS2-VASc score.
The final study population (n = 14 020) was distributed
according to treatment type: warfarin (n = 7674 [54.7%]),
dabigatran (n = 3272 [23.3%]), rivaroxaban( n = 1604
[11.4%]), and apixaban (n = 1470 [10.5%]) (eFigure 1 in the
Supplement). The mean (SD) follow-up was 2.6 (1.6) years,
with the shortest follow-up for the group treated with
apixaban (mean [SD] follow-up, 1.1 [0.7] years) reflecting its
later market introduction.
Baseline information about the initial study population
before weighing is shown in Table 1. The 5151 women
(36.7%) included in the study population were separated
into treatment groups: 1160 (35.5%) were treated with dabi-
gatran, 589 (40.1%) were treated with apixaban, 2793
(36.4%) were treated with warfarin, and 609 (38.0%) were
treated with rivaroxaban. All patients had 1 nonsex-related
and 1 point-valued stroke risk factor according to the
CHA2DS2-VASc score. The dominant factor for inclusion was
being 65 to 74 years (n = 8319, 59.3%). Patients initiated
with dabigatran or warfarin were slightly younger; 1884
patients (57.6%) were treated with dabigatran and 4435
(57.8%) were older than 65 years compared with 963
patients (65.5%) treated with apixaban and 1037 patients
(64.7%) treated with rivaroxaban who were older than 65
years. Hypertension, which affected 4446 participants
(31.7%), was lowest among the 411 patients (28.0%) initiated
with apixaban and 471 patients (29.4%) treated with rivar-
oxaban and highest among the 1134 patients (37.4%) using
dabigatran. The remaining 1255 patients (8.9%) were
included because they received a diagnosis of vascular dis-
eases (eg, myocardial infarction, peripheral artery disease,
or aortic plaques), diabetes, or heart failure. Diabetes was
the primary reason among the NOACs, whereas they were
distributed more evenly among patients treated with warfa-
rin. Notably, 8750 patients (62.4%) had a prescription his-
tory with either 0 or only 1 drug within the Anatomical
Therapeutic Chemical chapters B or C, which cover multiple
cardiovascular indications. Apixaban had the highest pro-
portion (n = 982, 66.8%) and warfarin (n = 4732, 61.6%) and
dabigatran (n = 2015, 61.6%) had a lower proportion.
Approximately 1134 patients (8%) were intensively treated,
with 4 or more different drugs prescribed, ranging from 108
patients (6.7%) in the group treated with rivaroxaban to 286
patients (8.7%) in the group treated with dabigatran.
After weighing the study populations using the IPTW
method, all baseline differences were less than 0.08 standard-
ized differences at maximum (eFigure 2 in the Supplement).
An inspection of individual propensity score distributions
showed a sufficient overlap between treatment populations to
obtain a valid comparison (eFigures 3-5 in the Supplement).
Effectiveness: Stroke and Systemic Embolism
Event count and crude or weighted rates for the different
NOACs and warfarin are shown in Table 2, for 1 and 2.5 years
follow-up. Falsification analysis, described below, found that
these end points did not falsify, indicating residual confound-
ing. Survival analyses are first described below.
Fortheprincipaleffectivenessendpointofischemicstroke/
systemic embolism, 103 events (80.5% as primary diagnoses)
were observed within the first year, representing a rate be-
tween 0.65 and 1.20 per 100 person-years among the IPTW
population. The estimated effect sizes in terms of hazard ra-
tios (HR) of the NOACs ranged between 0.81 (95% CI, 0.49-
1.34) and 1.46 (0.79-2.70), with all treatment groups display-
ing statistically nonsignificant differences compared with
warfarin (Figure 1). The primary effectiveness outcome was al-
most exclusively composed of ischemic stroke, and only 3
events were systemic embolism (data not shown).
In sensitivity analyses restricted to patients with a his-
tory of AF discharge codes or to the cohort with a low mortal-
ityforthecompositeendpointofischemicstroke/systemicem-
bolism at 1 year, the findings from the main analysis were
generally in agreement, and no statistically significant differ-
ences between NOAC agents compared with warfarin were
observed.Thenumberofeventsandtheeventratesforthesen-
sitivity analyses on the configuration of the study cohorts are
provided in Table 3.
All-Cause Mortality
There was an apparent significant lower risk of all-cause mor-
tality, death, across all treatment groups compared with war-
farin, although effect sizes shifted toward unity and became
nonsignificant when restricted to patients who were hospi-
talized with AF (Figure 1).
When restricting the study population to patients with-
out conditions associated with increased mortality (ie, exclud-
ing patients with heart failure, chronic pulmonary disease, or

 cancer), all effect estimates were lower for NOAC agents com-
pared with warfarin, while only treatment with rivaroxaban
reached a statistically significant lower death rate (HR, 0.39;
95% CI, 0.17-0.91).
Excluding approximately 3084 patients (22%) with a
conjectured high mortality risk resulted in a pronounced
reduction in the absolute number of deaths (from 345 to 112)
across treatment groups (eFigure 1 in the Supplement). The re-
sults of the supplementary analyses generally align with the
main analysis, but should be interpreted with caution in light
ofthesensitivityanalysisonthegroupwithlowmortalityrates.
Bleeding Events
A total of 157 events (90% primary diagnoses) of the com-
bined end point of “any bleeding” were observed during the
first year of follow-up. The weighted event rates ranged be-
tween 0.57 (apixaban) to 1.53 (warfarin).
When compared with warfarin, apixaban and dabigatran
were associated with lower bleeding events (HR, 0.35; 95% CI,
0.17-0.72; and HR, 0.48; 95% CI, 0.30-0.77, respectively)
(Figure 1). This was statistically nonsignificant for the
comparison of rivaroxaban vs warfarin (HR, 0.84; 95% CI,
0.49-1.44).
In sensitivity analyses restricted to patients with AF with
an AF hospital discharge code or to the cohort with low mor-
tality rates, the rates were overall lower in the latter cohort,
although altogether the direction of associations from the
main analysis was generally maintained. For the supplemen-
tary subgroup analyses, the smaller sample sizes led to more
uncertain effect estimates, although they were aligned with
the main analyses (eTables 3-8 and eFigures 6 and 7 in the
Supplement).
After analyzing the outcomes of intracranial (including
traumatically induced) bleeding and gastrointestinal bleed-
ing, few events were observed among the populations
treated with NOACs (ie, no more than 6 events in each treat-
ment group) (Table 2). Fifty five bleeding events (35%) were
observed. When compared with warfarin, each NOAC exhib-
ited a lower relative risk of intracranial bleeding with esti-
mates (ie, HRs) ranging from 0.11 (95% CI, 0.01-0.78) to 0.53
(95% CI, 0.15-1.87). The low event numbers resulted in wide
confidence intervals, which preclude any statistically sig-
nificant conclusions.
Resultsforafollow-upof2.5years(eFigure8intheSupple-
ment) aligned with these results, as did the trimmed IPTW
analyses when compared with the adjusted Cox regression on
the unweighted population (data not shown).
Falsification Analysis
For the falsification outcomes analyses on the associated
treatment-exposure relationship, the a priori null-
hypothesis of neutral associations was generally rejected,
indicating a possible persistent bias. In the subgroup analy-
sis of the cohort hospitalized with AF and the cohort with
low mortality rates, the associations between exposure and
studied falsification outcomes were neutral, indicating a low
likelihood of persistent bias (Figure 2, eFigure 8, and eTable
9 in the Supplement).
Discussion
In this study of patients with AF with 1 nonsex-related
CHA2DS2-VASc risk factor, our principal findings were as fol-
lows: (1) for ischemic stroke/systemic embolism, no signifi-
cant differences of the NOACs compared with warfarin were
evident; (2) death was significantly lower for all 3 NOACs
compared with warfarin, but this appears mainly driven by

 across these comparisons that was presumably related to
selective prescribing and unobserved comorbidities.
In patients with a CHADS2 score of 0 to 1, ancillary analy-
ses from the RELY, ARISTOTLE, and AVERROES clinical trials
show that there was no significant interaction for the effi-
cacy and safety data on NOACs (ie, dabigatran or apixaban)
compared with warfarin or aspirin.15-17 However, the ran-
domized clinical trials for rivaroxaban (ROCKET-AF) or
edoxaban (ENGAGE-AF) did not include patients with 1
stroke risk factor; for example, the inclusion criteria for
ROCKET-AF was confined to patients with a CHADS2 score of
2 or more or having experienced a prior stroke, and even
those with a CHADS2 score of 2 were capped at 10%.18,19
Hence, the relative effectiveness and safety of these 2 NOAC
agents (ie, rivaroxaban or edoxaban, compared with warfa-
rin) can benefit from observational cohort studies. As men-
tioned, the lack of clinical trial data has led to some guide-
lines that express a preference for treatment with dabigatran
or apixaban for patients with 1 stroke risk factor, with the
other NOACs or warfarin as “alternatives.
”20,21 However, the
current analysis cannot firmly support these preferences,
and prescribing physicians are also encouraged to evaluate
each patient with AF individually to select the preferred
agent.22
Many guidelines have expressed a preference for NOACs
over warfarin for treating patients with AF with 1 or more
stroke risk factors. The current threshold for OAC for stroke
prevention has been quoted as a stroke rate of 1.7%year for
warfarin, and 0.9%/year for an NOAC, reflecting the change
in tipping point for treatment with the availability of
NOACs.23 Even this treatment threshold of 1.7%/year with
warfarin could be lowered with good-quality anticoagula-
tion control with a time in therapeutic range of more than
70%.24 Given the lack of specific randomized clinical trial
data in an exclusive patient population with 1 stroke risk
factor, guidelines have suggested that OACs should be con-
sidered (grade IIa recommendation) for those with 1 risk
factor (CHA2DS2-VASc score of 1 in men or 2 in women)

 whereas OACs are recommended (grade I recommendation)
for patients with 2 or more stroke risk factors.25
Nevertheless, there has been controversy regarding the ac-
tual stroke event rates with 1 stroke risk factor, given the likely
differences of risk associated with different risk factors. Also,
differentstudysettings(eg,hospitalizedvscommunity),races/
ethnicities (Asian vs non-Asian) and methods of analyses may
be relevant factors.26,27 Indeed, some studies28,29 putatively
reporting low event rates excluded patients who ever took
OACs, hence conditioning analyses on the future, and artifi-
cially biasing results toward low event rates.26 Even 1 stroke
risk factor has a positive net clinical benefit for OAC treat-
mentcomparedwithaspirinornotreatment.30Also,strokerisk
among patients with AF not a static phenomenon, and clini-
cal scores like the CHA2DS2-VASc scores are reductionist and
a simplification.27
The observation on the lower risk of death among
patients who received NOAC treatment compared with war-
farin requires attention. This difference in conclusion is
likely because of selective prescribing by physicians; these
analyses could suggest that rivaroxaban may be preferred
for frailer patients compared with the other treatment alter-
natives. Causes of death available in real-world data analy-
ses are in general not adjudicated and either cerebral
imaging or post mortems are not mandated. It is evident
that some deaths could be because of fatal strokes, as there
is an increased risk of stroke in AF. Nonetheless, both stroke
and death has been shown to be significantly reduced by
treatment with warfarin vs placebos/controls.31 For mortal-
ity rates, there is even an added 10% reduction with treat-
ment with NOACs over warfarin.32
Our falsification end points generally did not falsify, indi-
cating the presence of residual confounding across these com-
parisons. Indeed, there are multiple considerations that indi-
cate confounding. For example, there are important variables
that are known to influence treatment selection that are not
present in the data set, such as body mass index (calculated
as weight in kilograms divided by height in meters squared),
actual blood pressures, heart rate, smoking status, estimated
glomerular filtration rate, hematocrit, New York Heart Asso-
ciation class, left ventricle ejection fraction, and type of AF.
For the results to be totally unconfounded, these factors would
need to be unrelated to the treatment assignment. Successful
falsification does not prove a lack of confounding, as the
sources of confounding may be different for different out-
comes. However, the failure to falsify (as in our study) raises
the likelihood that unmeasured confounders exist, and may
well be relevant to our outcomes of interest and, perhaps add
bias toward NOACs.
Indeed, our analyses indicate that some selective pre-
scribing may contribute to an important bias of the rates,
and caution concerning conclusions on effects associated
with death is warranted. Indeed, the analyses on falsifica-
tion outcomes could not provide a reassurance of unbiased
estimates, recognizing the findings of positive associations
in the 4 investigations of false outcomes. However, when

 investigating falsified outcomes among the cohort with low
mortality rates, we observed neutral associations when con-
trasting exposure groups, while the associations on treat-
ment exposure and effectiveness or safety outcomes were
generally maintained. While these (sensitivity) analyses do
not guarantee that our analyses are completely unbiased, it
does provide some reassurance and indicates that the
observed associations may be “true” associations.
Concisely, observational studies are inherently subject
to confounding and may lead to biased estimates. However,
we systematically and analytically investigated confounding
and biases in sensitivity analyses and falsification outcomes,
and in general, our approaches pointed toward causal asso-
ciations between treatment exposure and effectiveness and
safety outcomes.
The main analysis of the end point of “any bleeding” in-
dicated that it was significantly lower for apixaban and dabi-
gatran compared with warfarin but was nonsignificant for the
comparison of rivaroxaban vs warfarin. Again, this is broadly
consistent with prior analyses.33-35 Ancillary analyses of ran-
domized clinical trial cohorts for the minority of patients with
a CHADS2 score of 0 to 1 show consistency between the effect
sizes of NOAC vs warfarin and the main trial observations.15-17
Therewasbroadconsistencyacrossmostsubgroupsinoursen-
sitivity analyses and whether 1- or 2.5-year follow-up periods

Limitations
The main limitation of this study relates to the observational
nature of the data, and residual or unmeasured confounding
probably persists. A propensity weighing approach to ac-
count for baseline differences were used; however, the full ex-
tentandeffectofdifferentprescribingbehaviormaynotbefully
captured and may have caused biased effect estimates. In-
deed, because we investigated rare outcomes, even a few er-
roneously coded outcomes could shift the direction of asso-
ciations. Nevertheless, the outcomes ascertained have been
previously validated with a high-positive predictive value (eg,
97%-100% for ischemic stroke).36
The presented sensitivity analysis on the cohort with
low mortality rates suggests selective prescribing and war-
rants caution on the conclusions drawn on mortality rates.
Indeed, end points were not adjudicated (unlike among a
clinical trial cohort) and postmortems were not mandated,

 which leaves the possibility that some deaths could be
because of fatal strokes uncertain. Information on the time
in therapeutic range among people treated with warfarin
was not available, nor did we have detailed information on
laboratory (eg, serum creatinine), anthropometric, or socio-
economic data. Thus, our confounder adjustment was par-
tially determined by the information available in the regis-
tries. Patient adherence to the NOACs and prescribing
practices was not considered, but may be a potential driver
of the differences between drugs, and differences in a
patient’
s medical experience may influence his or her
adherence to treatment. Our data apply to a predominantly
white European population, and differential efficacy and
safety benefits may be evident among Asian and non-Asian
people.37,38 Indeed, these limitations could nullify the pos-
sible benefits of NOACs, notwithstanding that our data
show that at the very minimum, the NOACs have a similar
effectiveness to warfarin with trends toward a better safety
profile.
Conclusions
In this Danish observational cohort study of patients with AF
and a single stroke risk factor, there was no difference be-
tween NOACs compared with warfarin in the risk of patients
experiencing an ischemic stroke/systemic embolism. For “any
bleeding,” this was lower for apixaban and dabigatran com-
pared with warfarin. These data do not allow for a definitive
statement regarding the comparative effectiveness or safety
of NOACs because of possible residual confounding un-
masked with falsification outcomes.
