Zika virus (ZIKV) crosses the placenta and causes congenital disease. Here we develop an
animal model utilizing direct ZIKV inoculation into the uterine wall of pregnant, immuno-
competent mice to evaluate transplacental transmission. Intrauterine inoculation at
embryonic day (E) 10, but not E14, with African, Asian or American strains of ZIKV reduces
fetal viability and increases infection of placental and fetal tissues. ZIKV inoculation at E10
causes placental inflammation, placental dysfunction and reduces neonatal brain cortical
thickness, which is associated with increased activation of microglia. Viral antigen localizes in
trophoblast and endothelial cells in the placenta, and endothelial, microglial and neural
progenitor cells in the fetal brain. ZIKV infection of the placenta increases production of IFNb
and expression of IFN-stimulated genes 48 h after infection. This mouse model provides
a platform for identifying factors at the maternal–fetal interface that contribute to adverse
perinatal outcomes in a host with an intact immune system.

 Z
ika virus (ZIKV) infection of pregnant women is linked
with a variety of birth defects including microcephaly,
intracranial calcifications, ocular disease, hearing deficits,
intrauterine
growth
restriction
and
spontaneous
abortion,
collectively termed congenital Zika syndrome1–7, and ZIKV
RNA has been detected in amniotic fluid from affected fetuses,
and in the brains of fetuses from terminated pregnancies2–5,8–10.
A recent case-control study has concluded the microcephaly
epidemic in Brazil is caused by congenital ZIKV infection11, but
the pathogenesis and virus strain-dependence of ZIKV infection
at the maternal–fetal interface has not been well characterized.
The risk to the fetus following maternal ZIKV infection during
pregnancy is dependent on gestational age. Infections estimated
to have occurred at the end of the first trimester are correlated
with higher rates of congenital infection and more severe fetal
outcomes than infections occurring later during the second and
third trimesters12–14. Vaginal infection with ZIKV in immuno-
compromised mice has also demonstrated gestational age-
dependent differences in effects on fetal body mass15. However,
no animal model to date has allowed investigation of how
gestational age, and more specifically how the timing of
placentation (that is, formation of the cellular barrier that
separates maternal and fetal circulations) and fetal neurogenesis
influence vertical ZIKV transmission.
In part because ZIKV NS5 effectively targets the interferon
(IFN) signalling pathway in humans, but not in mice16, mice are
less susceptible to infection, and immunocompetent adult mice
replicate only low levels of viral RNA and develop no evidence of
clinical disease15,17. Published murine models of ZIKV infection
and fetal transmission have predominately studied pathogenesis
following systemic routes of virus inoculation (for example,
subcutaneous, intraperitoneal or intravenous), comparing immu-
nocompetent with immunocompromised IFN receptor deficient
(IFNAR � / �) mice15,18. ZIKV infection of IFNAR � / � mice
results in productive virus replication and clinical disease17,19,20.
ZIKV infection of IFNAR � / � and other immunodeficient mice
during early pregnancy, that is before complete placentation21,
results in virus transmission to the fetus15,22. Because IFN
signalling has been identified as an important factor influencing
ZIKV infection in vitro23–26, an accurate in vivo ZIKV model of
maternal–fetal transmission should take into account the IFN
responses induced in the maternal and fetal tissues after infection.
ZIKV infection of pregnant, immunocompetent mice has been
limited to SJL and C57BL/6 mice, with the outcomes following
systemic or vaginal routes of infection being variable, with copies
of viral RNA being very low, and in some cases requiring the use
of viral inoculums that are several logs higher than the amount of
virus subsequently detected in either reproductive tissues or
fetuses14,15,22,27. Previous studies also do not adequately address
ZIKV transmission across the placental barrier as most studies
have relied on infection of dams before complete place-
ntation15,18.
There is an ongoing and urgent need to develop and
characterize animal models for the study of ZIKV maternal–
fetal transmission and disease, and to identify factors at the
maternal–fetal interface that contribute to adverse perinatal
outcomes. We sought to develop an animal model using
immunocompetent, outbred, pregnant mice that would enable
us to evaluate the mechanisms of ZIKV transmission at the
maternal–fetal interface (that is, across the placental barrier).
Using direct intrauterine (IU) inoculation at times during
gestation, when the placental barrier is formed21, we bypassed
the need for peripheral ZIKV replication in murine tissues and
determined the effects of the route of inoculation, gestational age,
and ZIKV strain on perinatal outcomes. This tractable system
provides a model for the study of vertical ZIKV transmission and
investigation of the host and viral determinants that influence
pathogenesis at the maternal–fetal interface in an immuno-
competent host.
Results
Placental ZIKV infection has perinatal effects. To test whether
IU ZIKV inoculation results in ZIKV infection during pregnancy,
immunocompetent, timed-pregnant mice were inoculated at E10
with either 106 TCID50 units of 1968 Nigerian ZIKV (IBH 30656)
or vehicle by direct IU injections or systemic intraperitoneal (IP)
injections (Fig. 1a). Because placental development in the mouse
is delayed compared with humans and the definitive placental
structure is not present until E10 in mice21, which is comparable
to gestational day 21 in humans, we chose E10 as our earliest
infection time-point. Tissues from dams and fetuses were
collected 48 h post-inoculation (hpi). Compared with vehicle-
infected controls, fetal viability at 48 hpi was significantly reduced
following IU, but not IP, ZIKV inoculation (Fig. 1b). ZIKV
RNA—indicating
the
presence
of
either
infectious
or
noninfectious virus—was not detectable in serum, but was
detected at low-levels in the spleens of both IU and IP
inoculated dams (Fig. 1c). Intrauterine, but not IP, inoculation
with ZIKV resulted in low levels of viral RNA in the uterine
horns, and higher levels of viral RNA in placentas and fetal heads
(Fig. 1c). Further, there was a significant association between
levels of viral RNA in placentas and corresponding fetal heads
(Fig.
1d).
Infectious
virus—indicating
an
active,
ongoing
infection—was detected in uterine horns, placental and fetal
heads of IU, but not IP, inoculated dams (Fig. 1e). In fetal heads
collected
from
IU-infected
dams,
there
was
a
significant
association between the amount of viral RNA and infectious
virus (Fig. 1f).
To determine if contemporary strains of ZIKV could also be
transmitted at the maternal–fetal interface, timed-pregnant mice
were inoculated IU at E10 with either vehicle or 106 TCID50 units
of 2010 Cambodian ZIKV (FSS13025), 2015 Brazilian ZIKV
(Pariaba) or 2015 Puerto Rican ZIKV (PRVABC59), as well as
1968 Nigerian ZIKV, and tissues from dams and fetuses were
collected 48 hpi. Fetal viability at 48 h following infection with
either historic (1968 Nigerian) or contemporary (2010 Cambo-
dian, 2015 Brazilian or 2015 Puerto Rican) strains of ZIKV was
significantly reduced compared with vehicle-inoculated dams,
with no significant difference in fetal viability between ZIKV
strains (Fig. 2a). ZIKV RNA was detectable at similar levels in the
maternal
spleen, uterine horns,
placenta and fetal
heads,
regardless of ZIKV strain (Fig. 2b). Furthermore, the relative
viral RNA load (for all ZIKV strains) in the placenta, but not in
the maternal spleen, correlated with the corresponding viral load
in the fetal heads (Fig. 2c,d). These data illustrate that following
IU inoculation of immunocompetent mice, multiple strains of
ZIKV
have
the
capacity
to
induce
fetal
resorption
and
productively replicate in both placental and fetal brain tissue,
with the presence of ZIKV virus in the placenta predicting
transmission to the fetus in this model.
Fetal outcomes are dependent on gestational age. Human
reports and mouse models suggest that the relative risk to the
fetus following ZIKV infection during pregnancy is dependent on
gestational age12,13,15. We investigated how gestational age at the
time of ZIKV exposure affects rates of infection and transmission
at the maternal–fetal interface in mice. We compared infection at
E10 (that is, the time of complete placentation21) with infection at
E14, which marks the cessation of placental expansion and
growth in mice28, and corresponds with the third trimester in
humans. Following IU inoculation with ZIKV (using the 1968

 Nigerian strain as a proxy for all ZIKV strains) at either E10 or
E14, we compared fetal viability and viral burden at 48 hpi. Fetal
viability at 48 hpi was significantly greater in dams infected at E14
compared with those infected at E10 (Fig. 3a). ZIKV RNA was
detectable in placentas from E14-inoculated dams, but relative
viral RNA loads were lower compared with placentas from
E10-inoculated dams (Fig. 3b), and no infectious virus was
detected in placentas from E14-inoculated dams (Fig. 3c). Neither
ZIKV RNA nor infectious virus was detectable in fetal heads from
E14-inoculated dams, which is in contrast with the readily
detectable ZIKV RNA and infectious virus in fetal heads from
E10-inoculated dams (Fig. 3b,c). At 48 hpi, although ZIKV RNA

 ZIKV loads were generally higher in tissues collected from E10-
than E14-inoculated dams, but this did not reach statistical
significance. Overall, however, the proportion of ZIKV RNA and
infectious virus positive tissues was reduced at 96 hpi compared
with 48 hpi (Fig. 3e,f) suggesting control of virus replication in
these immunocompetent mice (Fig. 3c,f). Taken together, these
data demonstrate that ZIKV inoculation earlier in gestation
results in greater transmission of virus to the fetus and reduced
fetal viability.
ZIKV antigen localized in the placenta and fetal brain. The
distribution and cell tropism of ZIKV antigen following IU
inoculation at E10 was evaluated in the feto-placental unit ‘en
mass’ by immunohistochemistry (IHC). We selected E10 for
evaluation of ZIKV cell tropism because this time-point is asso-
ciated with placentation21, neurogenesis29 and high levels of
ZIKV infection (Fig. 3). To assess cell tropism at the inoculation
site, IHC for ZIKV antigen in a-actin þ smooth muscle cells in
the uterine myometrium was evaluated. Despite detectable ZIKV
RNA (Fig. 1c), viral antigen was not detectable within the uterine
myometrium 48 h following IU inoculation (Supplementary
Fig. 1a), which is consistent with the low amounts of infectious
virus present in these tissues. In the placenta, however, ZIKV
antigen was abundant at both 48 and 96 hpi (Fig. 4a; Supple-
mentary Fig. 1b) and localized predominantly in Cytokeratin þ
trophoblasts and Vimentin þ
endothelial cells (Fig. 4b,c).
Placentas from dams inoculated with ZIKV at E10 also
sustained significant damage, characterized by an overall loss of
definition between placental layers, a reduction of the labyrinth,
and significant haemorrhage and mixing of maternal and fetal
blood (Fig. 4d), suggestive of a compromised trophoblast–
endothelial cell barrier.
We only evaluated the cell tropism of ZIKV in fetal heads
because fetal bodies harboured lower levels of viral RNA
compared with corresponding fetal heads at both 48 and 96 hpi
(Fig. 5a). In the fetal brain, ZIKV antigen was present at both 48
and 96 hpi (Fig. 5b and Supplementary Fig. 1c), where it loca-
lized in CD34 þ fetal endothelial cells, Iba-1 þ microglia, and
Nestin þ neural progenitor cells (Fig. 5c–e). Similar to reports of
direct inoculation into the fetal brain in vivo14,30 or infection of
cells in vitro22,23,25,27,31–33, these data suggest that ZIKV can
infect multiple cell types in both the placenta and fetal brain.

before placentation), either systemically18 or vaginally15 with
diverse strains of ZIKV, results in productive systemic infection
and dissemination of the virus to the fetus. Studies in vitro
highlight the role of type I IFN signalling in limiting ZIKV
infection and replication in human epithelial cell lines34,35. To
confirm activation of type I IFN signalling in our ZIKV model, we
measured type I IFNs (IFNa and IFNb) and associated IFN-
stimulated genes (ISGs) in the placentas of mock and ZIKV IU-

the ISG messenger RNAs (mRNAs), Isg15, Ifitm3 and Oas1b was

 ZIKV infection in immunocompetent mice results in the
induction of type I IFN and associated downstream targets in
the placenta.
TAM receptor tyrosine kinases in the placenta. Although the
entry receptor(s) for ZIKV has not been identified, studies in vitro
highlight TAM receptor tyrosine kinases as one class of proteins
that can mediate ZIKV entry. Within the TAM receptor family,
Axl has been detected on multiple ZIKV cellular targets, including
subsets of placental trophoblasts36. To characterize the role of
TAM receptors in vivo, we measured relative mRNA expression
of the receptors Mertk and Axl, as well as the associated adaptor
protein, Gas6, in maternal spleens and placentas from both
mock- and ZIKV-infected dams (Fig. 7a–c). In mock-infected
dams, relative expression of Mertk, Axl and Gas6 was significantly
greater in the placenta compared with the spleen. In the
spleen,

expression
of
Mertk,
Axl
and

 ZIKV-infected dams, but Mertk and Gas6 remained unchanged,
compared with mock-infected dams. Taken together, these
data suggest that relative TAM receptor expression is tissue-
dependent, and expression can be induced with ZIKV infection.
Postnatal neuroinflammation and cortical thinning. To char-
acterize the effects of in utero ZIKV infection on fetal develop-
ment, a subset of dams infected at E10 were followed to term. At
postnatal day (PND) 0, neonates were killed, weighed and tissues
were collected for detection of virus and histological evaluation of
the brain. Cortical thickness was quantified from Nissl-stained
tissue sections of neonatal brains (Fig. 8a) as a measure of
neural development14,30, and correlate of cortical brain injury as
detectable by diffusion magnetic resonance imaging37. Immuno-
histochemistry was also performed to detect and quantify Iba-1 þ
microglia as a marker of neural inflammation. At PND 0,
compared with those from mock-infected dams, neonatal brains
from
ZIKV-infected

had

increased
concentrations

microglia
(Fig. 8c,d), and evidence of increased microglia activation as
shown by their amoeboid shape (Fig. 8c). Cortical thinning and
neural inflammation (as depicted by the amoeboid shape of the
microglia in Fig. 8c) was observed in the absence of detectable
ZIKV RNA (Fig. 8e). Furthermore, there was no detectable
reduction in body mass of neonates from ZIKV-infected dams
(Fig. 8f), despite liter sizes being smaller in ZIKV- compared with
mock-infected dams (Fig. 8g). These data illustrate that IU ZIKV
inoculation into pregnant immunocompetent mice results in
neuroinflammation and cortical thinning in postnatal brains.
Discussion
Epidemiological studies illustrate that ZIKV infection during
pregnancy can cause congenital infection and fetal abnormal-
ities11. However, not all pregnant women infected with ZIKV will
transmit the virus to the fetus, and not all infected fetuses will
exhibit overt evidence of congenital disease12,13,38–43. The
pathogenesis of ZIKV infection at the maternal–fetal interface
and the mechanisms that mediate transplacental transmission,
however, are poorly understood. We demonstrate that IU inocu-
lation with multiple strains of ZIKV into pregnant immuno-
competent mice results in placental and fetal infection and
adverse
perinatal
outcomes.
Using
this
model,
we
have
characterized the pathogenesis of infection with diverse ZIKV
strains at the maternal–fetal interface, identified gestational age as
a factor that facilitates transplacental ZIKV transmission, and
investigated postnatal sequelae.
Direct inoculation of infectious agents into the reproductive
tract of pregnant mice has been established as a model for
studying complications associated with IU inflammation44,
ascending bacterial infections45 and teratogenic viral infe-
ctions46 during pregnancy. In the context of our model of
ZIKV
infection
of
pregnant mice,
direct
inoculation
was
necessary for viral dissemination and replication in placentas
and fetuses. In our study, systemic IP inoculation with an
equivalent dose of ZIKV did not result in detectable ZIKV RNA
or infectious virus placentas or fetuses. Similar to in vitro cell
cultures and organoid systems23,36,47–50, this model permits
controlled delivery of ZIKV to reproductive tissues for the
focused study of virus pathogenesis at the maternal–fetal
interface. The advantage of this model over in vitro cultures
and organoid systems is that ZIKV infection can be analysed in
the context of pregnancy and an intact immune response.
The association between ZIKV infection during pregnancy and
adverse perinatal outcomes has been better documented with
contemporary than with historic ZIKV strains. We compared
relative infectivity, transmission rates and disease outcomes follo-
wing IU inoculation with both historic African (1968 Nigeria)
and contemporary Asian (2010 Cambodia), and American (2015
Brazil and 2015 Puerto Rico) ZIKV isolates. Following IU
inoculation, there were no significant differences in relative viral
load, transmission rate or fetal outcome between different ZIKV
strains. Although it is possible that differences in systemic anti-
viral responses to the various ZIKV strains may influence virus
dissemination, upon entry into the female reproductive tract
during pregnancy, the potential for maternal–fetal transmission is
conserved across diverse ZIKV strains. These data are supported
by recent clinical observations in Southeast Asia illustrating that
ZIKV isolates from outside of the Americas are associated
with the induction of human birth defects51 and that both African
and Asian lineages of ZIKV have the capacity to infect the
reproductive tract of male mice52. Our observation that the
mouse-adapted 1968 Nigerian strain caused altered perinatal
outcomes to the same extent as Asian and American strains
suggests that all strains of ZIKV may possess the ability to cross
the placenta and lead to adverse perinatal outcomes and long-
term sequelae. The passage history of the 1968 Nigeria ZIKV
(IBH30656) in suckling mice may result in more efficient virus
replication than the other strains (for example, 2010 Cambodia,
2015 Brazil and 2015 Puerto Rico) that we tested, suggesting that
translation of these findings to other strains of ZIKV remains to
be determined53,54.
The placenta is an important physical and immunological
barrier against transmission of infectious agents during preg-
nancy. Placentation in both humans and mice is invasive and
results in the positioning of placental trophoblasts in direct
contact with maternal blood. Studies in vitro reveal that ZIKV
infects
human
primary
cytotrophoblasts25
and
trophoblast
cell lines22,23, which is hypothesized to contribute to virus
dissemination and fetal infection. We show that IU ZIKV
inoculation of pregnant immunocompetent mice, after complete
placentation, resulted in productive virus replication in placentas,
in vivo localization of ZIKV antigen in placental trophoblasts and
transplacental transmission of ZIKV to fetuses. Placental ZIKV
infection was also associated with the induction of anti-viral
inflammatory responses, including IFNb and several ISGs,
emphasizing that evaluation of type I IFN signalling is nece-
ssary to accurately study the pathogenesis of ZIKV infection at
the maternal–fetal interface.
Although the entry receptor(s) for ZIKV remain unknown,
many flaviviruses, including ZIKV, are thought to attach to or
enter target cells by interacting with members of the TAM
receptor kinase family34,36,55–58. The TAM receptor, Axl, is
expressed
on
subsets
of
placental
trophoblasts12,
and
overexpression in primary human fibroblasts34 and endothelial
cells58 augments ZIKV cellular entry and replication. Our data
show that Axl expression was higher in the placentas than spleens
of pregnant mice and was induced by ZIKV infection, which may
suggest a mechanism for selective tissue tropism.
Congenital infections in both humans and animals are often
associated with a window of susceptibility, which corresponds to
a time during gestation at which the infectious agent is most likely
to transmit to the fetus and have adverse effects. The specific
window of susceptibility varies for different infectious agents, and
is based on both pathogen and host factors. Host determinants
include a complex interplay between cellular, molecular, and
anatomic factors at the maternal–fetal interface, which change
throughout gestation and influence the relative receptivity of
placental and fetal tissues to infection. For teratogenic flavi-
viruses, including Japanese encephalitis virus in swine and bovine
viral diarrhoea virus in cattle, this window occurs during early
and mid-gestation, respectively59. Similarly, the highest risk of

 congenital disease following ZIKV infection during pregnancy in
women occurs at the end of the first trimester12,13,40.
In immunocompetent mice, ZIKV infection and transmission
following IU inoculation was dependent on gestational age, in
which IU inoculation earlier during pregnancy (that is, E10)
resulted in higher rates of fetal infection and resorption compared
with inoculation later in gestation (that is, E14). Although E10
represents mid pregnancy in mice, the hallmarks of murine
placental development at this gestational age are most similar to
first trimester pregnancy in humans. E10 in mice marks the
transition to the layered structure of the definitive placenta, at
which time all subsets of placental trophoblast cells are present28.
This is relatively delayed compared with placentation in humans,
in which the definitive placental structure forms by 3–4 weeks
post-conception (wpc)60, and development of the maternal blood
supply to the placenta is complete by the end of the first trimester
(B12 wpc)61. In mice and humans, the placenta continues to
grow throughout gestation in order to meet the demands of the
developing fetus; in CD1 mice, E14 marks the cessation of
placental growth62,63, which corresponds with the third trimester
placenta in humans64. Although we observed reduced viral
burden, transplacental transmission and fetal mortality following
inoculation at E14 compared with E10, the mechanisms that
underlie differences in ZIKV pathogenesis remain unknown. The
extensive placental damage following ZIKV infection at E10,
suggests that there are differences in either placental receptivity to
infection (for example, receptor expression), placental anti-viral
defenses or both. Future studies will characterize the cellular,
immunologic and anatomic dynamics at the maternal–fetal
interface that define the window of susceptibility for ZIKV-
associated congenital infection and disease.
Congenital disease associated with ZIKV infection is char-
acterized by a variety of fetal abnormalities, including intrauterine
growth restriction (that is, fetuses that are small for gestational
age),
microcephaly,
intracranial
calcifications
and
enlarged
ventricles65,66. Published data using both in vivo and in vitro
systems demonstrate that ZIKV infects neural progenitor cells
and triggers apoptosis that leads to cortical thinning and reduced
brain size14,22,30,67. In concordance with these studies, our data
demonstrate that IU ZIKV infection of dams at E10 resulted in
ZIKV infection of the fetal brain, localization of viral antigen in
fetal neural progenitor cells, increased neural inflammation and
reduced cortical thickness in neonates. Viral antigen also localized
in fetal endothelial and microglial cells, suggesting that multiple
cell types in the fetal brain support in vivo ZIKV infection and
may contribute to the observed neurologic deficits. Cortical
thinning and neuroinflammation were observed in neonatal
brains despite the absence of detectable viral RNA. Whether the
inflammation and cortical thinning in neonatal brains was caused
directly by ZIKV infection or indirectly as a consequence of
placental inflammation or dysfunction remains to be determined.
The observation of neuroinflammation itself, however, is evidence
of neurologic damage in the offspring of infected dams, and
suggests
the
possibility
of
long-term
sequelae,
including
neurocognitive and behavioural changes68.
The ZIKV epidemic poses a continued threat to pregnant
women. In the absence of an available vaccine, diverse animal
models are needed to better understand the pathogenesis of this
disease. The translational potential of our mouse model of ZIKV
infection is highlighted by the high viral burden detected in the
placentas and corresponding fetal heads, as well as the association
of type I IFN responses and ZIKV RNA at the maternal–fetal
interface. Because CD1 mice have an intact immune system and
genetic heterogeneity that is more similar to humans, we can
better identify immunological biomarkers of disease. Translation
of this infection model into different mouse strains may facilitate
identification of host factors that permit higher rates of congenital
infection that may function as therapeutic targets. This model
uniquely strengthens the repertoire of existing in vitro and in vivo
ZIKV infection models as a platform for testing early detection
methods, as well as candidate vaccines and therapeutics aimed at
preventing or limiting vertical ZIKV transmission or reducing the
severity of congenital disease.
Methods
Ethics statement. This study was carried out in accordance with the recom-
mendations in the Guide for the Care and Use of Laboratory Animals of the
National Institutes of Health. The protocols were approved by the Institutional
Animal Care and Use Committee and Health Safety and the Environment at Johns
Hopkins University.
Zika virus. The following strains of Zika virus (ZIKV) were purchased from the
American Type Culture Collection (ATCC): strain IB H 30656 (Nigeria, 1968) and
PRVABC59 (Puerto Rico, 2015). The FS13025 (Cambodia, 2010) strain was kindly
provided by Dr Robert Tesh at UTMB, and the Pariaba (Brazil, 2015) strain was
kindly provided by Dr Stephen Whitehead at the National Institute of Allergy and
Infectious Diseases. All procedures for handling ZIKV were approved by the
Institutional Biosafety Council. The ZIKV Nigeria 1968 virus was sequenced and
confirmed to be 99.99% identical to the virus sequence in Genebank (Genebank
accession number HQ234500).
Cells and infections. Vero cells (African green monkey kidney epithelial cells)
were obtained from low-passaged seed stocks authenticated and verified to be
mycoplasma-free from Dr Andrew Pekosz. Only stocks of frozen cells within two
passages of the original source material were used. All cells were maintained in
Dulbecco’s Modified Eagle Medium (DMEM) supplemented with 10% fetal bovine
serum, 1 mM sodium pyruvate, 100 U ml � 1 penicillin, 100 mg ml � 1 streptomycin
and 2 mM L-glutamine. The cells were cultured in humidified air supplemented
with 5% CO2 at 37 �C.
Stocks of ZIKV were generated by infecting Vero cells at a multiplicity of
infection (MOI) of 0.01 50% tissue culture infectious doses (TCID50) per cell in
DMEM supplemented with 2.5% fetal bovine serum, 1 mM sodium pyruvate,
100 U ml � 1 penicillin, 100 mg ml � 1 streptomycin and 2 mM L-glutamine
(infection media, IM). Approximately 72 hpi, the infected cell supernatant fluids
were collected, clarified by centrifugation at 900g for 10 min and stored in aliquots
at � 80 �C.
Infectious virus was quantified by TCID50 assay. Ten-fold serial dilutions of
supernatant fluids were prepared in IM and used to inoculate Vero cells in 96 well
tissue culture dishes (6 wells per dilution). The cells were incubated at 37 �C for 5–6
days at which time an equal volume of 4% formaldehyde solution was added to
each well and incubated for 15 min at room temperature to inactivate infectious
virus. The inactivated media was removed and the cells stained with naphthol
blue–black solution. Infectious virus titres were determined by the method of Reed
and Muench69.
Mouse experiments. Timed-pregnant adult (2–3 months of age) CD1 mice were
purchased from Charles River Laboratories. Animals arrived at E9 and were housed
in a specific-pathogen-free facility at Johns Hopkins University with ad libitum
access to food and water. Dams were allowed to acclimate for 424 h, which is
sufficient time for most basic measures of stress and immune function to return to
baseline in CD-1 mice70. All experimental procedures were performed at the same
time of the day.
At either E10 or E14, mice were anesthetized continuously with isoflurane and
underwent a mini-laparotomy in the lower abdomen for ZIKV injections. Animals
were randomly assigned to receive either 106 TCID50 units of ZIKV suspended in
100 mL DMEM or 100 mL DMEM alone. The dose of ZIKV was based on pilot
studies in which IU infection of dams with doses o106 TCID50 per ml did not
result in placental or fetal infection. For animals designated for IP injection, the full
inoculum was delivered into the abdominal cavity. For animals designated for IU
injection, the inoculum was divided equally into four injections delivered into the
uterine myometrium, opposite the placenta and between the gestational sacs of the
first five fetuses closest to the cervix of one uterine horn. The contralateral uterine
horn was not manipulated. Routine closure was performed after injections and
dams were returned to individual cages for recovery. Investigators were not blinded
to the treatment group allocation.
Mice were randomly selected to be killed by CO2 exposure followed by cardiac
exsanguination at either 48 (E12 or E16) or 96 (E14 or E18) hours post-infection or
after delivery postnatal (PND) 0, depending on experimental group. At the time of
euthanasia, the total number of viable and aborted/resorbed fetuses were quantified
for each dam. Fetal viability was determined as the percentage of fetuses within the
inoculated uterine horn for ZIKV- and mock-infected dams that were viable. Small
or discoloured fetuses, or the absence of a fetus at an implantation site were counted
as aborted or resorbed fetuses, respectively. Maternal spleen, serum, uterine horns,

 placentas and fetuses were collected from each dam for determination of viral
burden by qRT-PCR, TCID50 assay and immunohistochemistry. All animal studies
were conducted under animal BSL2 containment.
Tissue harvesting. Tissues were weighed and homogenized in a 1:10 weight per
volume of PBS using Lysing Matrix D tubes (MP Biomedicals) in a MP Fast-prep
24 5G instrument. Tissue homogenates were stored at � 80 �C. Total RNA was
extracted from tissue samples using the RNeasy Lipid Tissue Mini Kit (Qiagen) or
from serum and cell culture supernatant using QIAamp Viral RNA Mini Kit
(Qiagen), according to the manufacturer’s instructions.
Quantitative RT-PCR. Total RNA was extracted from tissue samples using the
RNeasy Lipid Tissue Mini Kit (Qiagen) or from serum and cell culture supernatant
using QIAamp Viral RNA Mini Kit (Qiagen).
ZIKV RNA levels were determined by one-step quantitative reverse
transcriptase-PCR (qRT-PCR) reaction using the QuantiTect Probe RT-PCR Kit
(Qiagen) according to the manufacturer’s protocol. The real-time PCR primers and
probe for ZIKV RNA detection were the ZIKV 1162c set described previously71,
which recognize diverse ZIKV strains but with limited sensitivity72. Primer
sequences and concentrations were as follows: Fwd (100 mM), 50-CCGCTGCC
CAACACAAG-30; Rev (100 mM), 50-CCACTAACGTTC TTTTGCAGACAT-30;
Probe (25 mM), 50-/56-FAM/AGCCTACCT/ZEN/TGACAAGCAATCAG
ACACTCAA/3IABkFQ/-30 (Integrated DNA Technologies). ZIKV RNA copies
were determined relative to a standard curve produced using serial 10-fold
dilutions of ZIKV (1968 Nigerian) RNA isolated from ZIKV stocks with a known
infectious virus titre. Relative levels of viral RNA in tissue were similar whether
values were calculated based on the log10 dilution curve for ZIKV RNA or relative
to the host housekeeping gene, Gapdh (Pearson correlation, R2 ¼ 0.913,
Po0.0001).
For TAM receptors and ISGs, RNA was quantified using a nanodrop
spectrophotometer, and complementary DNA (cDNA) was prepared with the High
Capacity cDNA reverse transcription kit (Life Technologies) using 2.5 mg of input
RNA. For the TAM receptors (Mertk, Axl and Gas6), quantitative real-time PCR
(qRT-PCR) was performed using 2.5 ml of cDNA, TaqMan gene expression arrays
(Mertk, Mm00434920_m1; Axl, Mm00437221_m1; and Gas6, Mm00490378_m1)
and � 2 Universal PCR Mastermix (Applied Biosystems), according to
manufacturer’s instructions. For the ISGs (Isg15, Ifitm3 and Oas1b), primers were
purchased from Integrated DNA Technologies, with sequences as follows: Isg15:
Fwd, 50-GGTGTCCGTGACTAACTCCAT-30; Rev, 50-TGGAAAGGGTAAGAC
CGTCCT-30; Ifitm3: Fwd, 50-CCCCCAAACTACGAAAGAATCA-30; Rev, 50-AC
CATCTTCCGATCCCTAGAC-30; Oas1b: Fwd, 50-GGGCCTCTAAAGGGGTCA
AG-30; Rev, 50-TCAAACTTCACTCCACAACGTC-30. Quantitative PCR was
performed using the SsoFast EvaGreen Supermix (Biorad) according to
manufacturer’s instructions. All reactions were run on the StepOnePlus Applied
Biosystems Real-time PCR machine under the following conditions: 50 �C for
2 min, 95 �C for 10 min, 95 �C for 15 s and 60 �C for 1 min for 50 cycles. Transcript
levels were determined by normalizing the target gene threshold cycle (CT) value to
the CT value of the endogenous housekeeping gene Gapdh (DCT).
ELISA. Interferon- a (IFN-a) and IFN-b levels were measured by enzyme-linked
immunosorbent assay (ELISA) (Verikine ELISA kits; PBL Interferon Source,
Piscataway, NJ) according to the manufacturer’s instructions. Placentas (10%, wt
per vol) were tested in duplicate. Sensitivity was 12.5–400 pg ml � 1 IFN-a and
0.94–60 pg ml � 1 for IFN-b.
Immunohistochemistry and immunofluorescence imaging. Tissues were fixed
in 4% paraformaldehyde for 24–48 h at 4 �C. Tissues were washed with PBS
extensively and immersed in 30% sucrose until saturation, followed by cryosection
at 20 mm thickness. Routine hematoxylin and eosin (H&E) staining was performed
to evaluate the morphological change of the placentas. Antigens were retrieved by
boiling in PBS buffer for 20 min. After antigen retrieval, tissues were blocked
in 10% goat serum and permeabilized with 0.5% Triton-X-100. Tissues were
incubated with primary antibodies overnight at 4 �C. The following primary
antibodies were used: mouse (1:200, MAB10216, clone D1-4G2-4-15, EMD
Millipore, Billerica, MA) or rabbit (1:200, Ab00230-23.0, clone D1-4G2-4-15,
Absolute Antibody, Oxford, UK) antibodies to flaviviruses to identify ZIKV; rabbit
anti-cytokeratin (1:200, Z0622, DAKO, Carpinteria, CA) to identify trophoblasts,
rabbit anti-vimentin (1:200, ab92547, clone EPR3776, Abcam, Cambridge, MA) to
identify fetal capillaries, rabbit anti-a-actin (1:200, ab5694, Abcam) to identify
uterus tissue, mouse anti-nestin (1:100, sc-58813, clone 2Q178, Santa Cruz, Dallas,
Texas) to identify neural stem cells, rabbit anti-Iba-1 (1:100, 019-1974, WAKO,
Richmond, VA) to identify microglial cells, and rabbit anti-CD34 (1:100, ab81289,
clone EP373Y, Abcam) to identify endothelial cells. The next day tissues were
washed with PBS, followed by secondary antibody incubation for 3 h at room
temperature. Secondary donkey antibodies used were: anti-rabbit IgG (1:500,
A21206, Life Technologies, Frederick, MD) or anti-mouse IgG (1:500, ab150105,
Abcam) Alexa Fluor 488; and anti-mouse IgG (1:500, A10037, Invitrogen, Rock-
ford, IL) or anti-rabbit IgG (1:500, A10042, Invitrogen) Alexa Fluor 568. DAPI
(40,6-diamidino-2-phenylindole, 10236276001, Roche, Indianapolis, IN) was used
to counter stain nuclei at a concentration of 1:5,000 Slides were mounted with
Fluoro-mount G (SouthernBiotech, Birmingham, AL) and viewed using a Zeiss
Axioplan 2 microscope (Jena, Germany) with a � 20 objective. Images were taken
using a Zeiss AxioCam MRM. Iba-1 þ microglia were quantified using ImageJ
(NIH) software.
Neonatal cortical measurements. Neonatal mice were killed at PND 0 and heads
were fixed and sectioned as described above. Routine Nissl staining was performed,
and images were taken under � 5 magnification using a Canon EOS Rebel (Tokyo,
Japan). Coronal cortical thickness was measured from five random sections at the
striatum level of each neonatal brain, as previously described37. Cortical thickness
was measured from both brain hemispheres in each section using ImageJ software,
and the average of 10 measurements per specimen presented. For quantification of
cortical microglial concentrations, the area of Iba-1 þ staining in the cortex was
quantified from five � 20 fields within the stratum level of each brain using ImageJ
software. Quantification shown represents the average measurement from a single
randomly chosen pup for each dam.
Statistical analysis. All data were analysed with GraphPad Prism software. Fetal
viability data were assessed with a Chi-square test. Infectious virus titres and viral
RNA data were analysed with one- or two-way ANOVAs using Kruskal-Wallis or
Bonferroni post-hoc corrections for multiple comparisons. Correlations were
analysed using a Pearson or Spearman correlation test. Interferon-b, ISG, and
TAM receptor data were analysed with either a paired t test or Mann-Whitney test,
depending on distribution. Mean cortical thickness, neonatal body mass and litter
size were analysed using a Mann–Whitney test. Mean differences were considered
statistically significant if Po0.05.
Data availability. All relevant data are available from the authors on request.
