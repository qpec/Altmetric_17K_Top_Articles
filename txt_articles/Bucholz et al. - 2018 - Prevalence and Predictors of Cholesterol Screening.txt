BACKGROUND: Familial hypercholesterolemia (FH) and other extreme 
elevations in low-density lipoprotein cholesterol significantly increase the 
risk of atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease; however, recent data suggest 
that prescription rates for statins remain low in these patients. National 
rates of screening, awareness, and treatment with statins among individuals 
with FH or severe dyslipidemia are unknown.
METHODS: Data from the 1999 to 2014 National Health and Nutrition 
Examination Survey were used to estimate prevalence rates of self-reported 
screening, awareness, and statin therapy among US adults (n=42 
471 
weighted to represent 212 million US adults) with FH (defined using the 
Dutch Lipid Clinic criteria) and with severe dyslipidemia (defined as low-
density lipoprotein cholesterol levels ≥190 mg/dL). Logistic regression 
was used to identify sociodemographic and clinical correlates of 
hypercholesterolemia awareness and statin therapy.
RESULTS: The estimated US prevalence of definite/probable FH was 0.47% 
(standard error, 0.03%) and of severe dyslipidemia was 6.6% (standard 
error, 0.2%). The frequency of cholesterol screening and awareness 
was high (>80%) among adults with definite/probable FH or severe 
dyslipidemia; however, statin use was uniformly low (52.3% [standard 
error, 8.2%] of adults with definite/probable FH and 37.6% [standard 
error, 1.2%] of adults with severe dyslipidemia). Only 30.3% of patients 
with definite/probable FH on statins were taking a high-intensity statin. 
The prevalence of statin use in adults with severe dyslipidemia increased 
over time (from 29.4% to 47.7%) but not faster than trends in the general 
population (from 5.7% to 17.6%). Older age, health insurance status, 
having a usual source of care, diabetes mellitus, hypertension, and having 
a personal history of early atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease were 
associated with higher statin use.
CONCLUSIONS: Despite the high prevalence of cholesterol screening and 
awareness, only ≈50% of adults with FH are on statin therapy, with even 
fewer prescribed a high-intensity statin; young and uninsured patients are 
at the highest risk for lack of screening and for undertreatment. This study 
highlights an imperative to improve the frequency of cholesterol screening 
and statin prescription rates to better identify and treat this high-risk 
population. Additional studies are needed to better understand how to 
close these gaps in screening and treatment.

levations of serum low-density lipoprotein cho-
lesterol (LDL-C) are associated with increased car-
diovascular disease morbidity and mortality,1,2 and 
severe elevations of LDL-C ≥190 mg/dL can indicate 
forms of familial hypercholesterolemia (FH).3,4 Statins 
are the first-line therapy in all disorders of elevated cho-
lesterol, including FH, because they have been shown 
to reduce the number of coronary heart disease (CHD) 
events and mortality in individuals with severe dyslipid-
emia.5–8 However, recent data suggest that prescription 
rates for statins remain low in young adults with severe 
dyslipidemia or diagnosed FH.9–12 With the advent of 
new treatments like PCSK9 (proprotein convertase sub-
tilisin/kexin type 9) inhibitors for severe dyslipidemia, it 
is imperative to understand the current gaps in the di-
agnosis and treatment of FH and severe dyslipidemia.
FH is an autosomal dominant genetic disorder that is 
characterized by elevated LDL-C, sometimes accompa-
nied by cutaneous manifestations (eg, xanthoma) and 
significantly increased risk of atherosclerotic cardiovas-
cular disease (ASCVD).13,14 Current estimates place the 
prevalence of FH at ≈1 in 250 individuals,15 and studies 
have demonstrated that FH increases the risk of CHD by 
13-fold.16 With proper treatment, the risk of ASCVD is 
greatly reduced, and possibly even equal to that of the 
unaffected population17; however, many people with 
FH are never diagnosed or treated. Cascade screen-
ing can help to identify individuals with FH using lipid 
screening combined with family history and, ideally, ge-
notyping.18 The term FH phenotype has also been used 
in epidemiological studies to describe individuals with 
severely elevated LDL-C, typically with levels >190 mg/
dL, in the absence of available information about geno-
type or family history.9,13,14 Although FH is a known ge-
netic disorder, severe dyslipidemia can be attributable 
to other acquired factors and is associated with a 5-fold 
increase in the risk of CHD over adults with LDL-C levels 
<130 mg/dL.14
Data from small samples of ambulatory care cen-
ters have demonstrated that over one third of patients 
with either severe dyslipidemia (LDL-C ≥190 mg/dL) or 
heterozygous FH are not prescribed statins, and only 
half of these patients are adequately treated.9,11,19 The 
presence of concurrent ASCVD or diabetes mellitus in-
creased the rate of statin treatment only slightly.9 Al-
though these studies have provided important insights 
into treatment rates among individuals with severe dys-
lipidemia, they have focused largely on patients treated 
at ambulatory care clinics, thereby excluding individuals 
without a regular source of care. In addition, no study 
has examined national rates of screening or awareness 
in conjunction with statin treatment in individuals with 
FH or characterized sociodemographic correlates of 
statin therapy in this population to understand which 
subgroups are at the highest risk of being untreated.
Accordingly, the aim of this study was to use a na-
tionally representative sample to quantify the preva-
lence rates of self-reported screening, awareness, and 
statin therapy among US adults with FH and severe 
dyslipidemia and to identify correlates of self-reported 
awareness and treatment in this group. Quantifying 
national rates and predictors of screening, awareness, 
and treatment is essential for understanding the gaps 
in screening and treatment to inform interventions that 
may increase the rates of diagnosis and treatment and, 
in turn, improve cardiac outcomes.
METHODS
Data Source
Data from the National Health and Nutrition Examination 
Survey (NHANES) were used for this study. Detailed informa-
tion on data collection, processing, and weighting procedures 
can be found online.20 In brief, NHANES is conducted by the 
National Center for Health Statistics to assess the health and 
nutritional status of the US population. It uses a stratified, 
multistage sampling design to obtain a nationally representa-
tive sample of the noninstitutionalized civilian population liv-
ing in the United States. Examining ≈5000 persons annually, 
NHANES has been continuously operating since 1999. Data 
are collected through in-home interviews and physical exami-
nations performed at mobile examination centers and include 
Clinical Perspective
What Is New?
• Familial hypercholesterolemia (FH) and severe dys-
lipidemia increase the risk of coronary heart dis-
ease and mortality; yet, the national prevalence 
of screening, awareness, and statin treatment for 
individuals with these conditions is unknown.
• Using data from the National Health and Nutri-
tion Examination Survey, we demonstrated a high 
prevalence of screening and awareness (>80%) but 
relatively low rates of statin use (52.3%) among 
individuals with FH and even lower with severe dys-
lipidemia (37.6%).
• The discrepancy between the prevalence of cho-
lesterol screening and treatment was most pro-
nounced in younger patients, uninsured patients, 
and patients without a usual source of health care.
What Are the Clinical Implications?
• Given the cardiovascular morbidity and mortality 
associated with FH and other severe dyslipidemias 
and the benefits of statin therapy among such 
patients, current rates of statin therapy in US adults 
with FH/severe dyslipidemia are too low.
• Further studies need to investigate strategies to 
improve treatment among adults with FH and 
severe dyslipidemia, particularly among younger 
adults and those with limited access to care.

detailed information on participant demographic, socioeco-
nomic, dietary, and health-related characteristics. For this 
study, we used data from NHANES 1999 to 2014 to maximize 
the number of participants with FH and to examine time trends 
in statin treatment. We included all nonpregnant adults aged 
≥20 years. All participants provided written informed consent. 
The study protocol was approved by the National Center for 
Health Statistics Institutional Review Board. This analysis was 
deemed exempt under federal regulation 45 CFR §46.101(b). 
The data, analytic methods, and study materials have been 
made available to other researchers for purposes of reproduc-
ing the results or replicating the procedures.20a
Laboratory Values
Detailed descriptions about blood collection and processing 
are provided in the NHANES Laboratory/Medical Technologists 
Procedures Manuals. Specimens for lipid, glycolated hemo-
globin, and serum glucose measurement were stored under 
appropriate refrigerated conditions and shipped weekly to 
the respective processing centers.
Lipid levels were measured from morning peripheral blood 
draws with 95% of participants reporting fasting for at least 
8 hours. Serum total cholesterol and triglycerides were mea-
sured enzymatically; high-density lipoprotein cholesterol was 
measured by direct immunoassay or by precipitation. LDL-C 
was calculated using the Friedewald equation if the triglycer-
ides level was ≤4.5 mmol/L (400 mg/dL).21
Definition of FH
We used a modified version of the Dutch Lipid Clinic (DLC) 
criteria to identify individuals having definite or probable FH. 
We chose to use the DLC criteria because they are the most 
easily adaptable for use in population surveys and to allow 
for comparisons with other studies using the DLC.10,15,22,23 
The DLC is a validated algorithm for the diagnosis of clini-
cal FH that classified individuals having definite or probable 
FH on the basis of LDL-C levels, physical examination find-
ings (xanthoma, arcus cornea), known gene defect causative 
for FH, and personal and family history of premature ASCVD. 
Because NHANES lacks the genetic and physical examination 
findings included in the full DLC, we used a modified version 
that assigned points based on LDL-C levels (ranging from 8 
points for LDL-C >8.5 mmol/L [330 mg/dL] down to 1 point 
for LDL-C 4.0–4.9 mmol/L [155–190 mg/dL]), personal history 
of ASCVD (2 points), and family history of early ASCVD in 
a first-degree relative (1 point). These modified criteria have 
been used in other population-based surveys to assess the 
prevalence of FH.12,15 For these criteria, personal ASCVD was 
defined as having a self-reported history of CHD, angina, 
heart attack, or stroke before the age of 55 years in men 
and the age of 60 years in women. Family history of ASCVD 
was defined as having a first-degree relative (mother, father, 
sisters, or brother) with a heart attack or angina before the 
age of 50 years.
For individuals who reported taking lipid-lowering medica-
tions or who brought statins to the mobile examination cen-
ter, we multiplied LDL-C levels by 1.43 to estimate untreated 
LDL-C levels for inclusion in the DLC criteria.10,15 The prevalence 
of definite/probable FH varied slightly depending on whether 
only self-reported lipid-lowering agent or documented statin 
use was used (Table I in the online-only Data Supplement). In 
addition to adults with definite/probable FH, we also exam-
ined adults with severe dyslipidemia separately, not includ-
ing the other DLC criteria. Severe dyslipidemia was defined as 
having LDL-C ≥190 mg/dL after adjustment for lipid-lowering 
medication use, regardless of FH status.
Variable Definitions
Height and weight were measured with a digital scale and 
stadiometer. Body mass index was calculated as weight 
in kilograms divided by height in meters squared. Criteria 
from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention were 
used to define body mass index categories as normal 
weight (≤24.9 kg/m2), overweight (25–29.9 kg/m2), and 
obese (≥30 kg/m2).
Blood pressure was measured by auscultation 3 consecu-
tive times after individuals had been seated for a minimum 
of 5 minutes. Hypertension was defined using the average 
blood pressure across the 3 measurements of ≥140 mm 
Hg 
systolic or ≥90 mm 
Hg diastolic, or self-reported use of an 
antihypertensive medication. Prehypertension was defined as 
an average blood pressure of 120 to 139 mm 
Hg systolic or 80 
to 89 mm 
Hg diastolic.
Given the large number of participants with missing fast-
ing plasma glucose, we used both fasting plasma glucose and 
hemoglobin A1c to identify individuals with diabetes mellitus 
and prediabetes. Diabetes mellitus was defined as either fast-
ing plasma glucose ≥126 mg/dL or hemoglobin A1c ≥6.5%, 
or self-reported use of insulin or oral agents. Prediabetes 
was defined as fasting plasma glucose 100 to 125 mg/dL or 
hemoglobin A1c 5.7% to 6.4%.24
We examined the association of specific sociodemo-
graphic and clinical characteristics with self-reported aware-
ness of hypercholesterolemia and statin use. Variables were 
selected based on prior literature and included age, sex, 
race/ethnicity, poverty (defined as the ratio of family income 
to geographic poverty level <133%),25 insurance status, 
education, place of birth, usual source of care, concurrent 
hypertension or diabetes mellitus, body mass index, and 
smoking status.
Outcome Definitions
The primary outcome was current statin use. Participants 
were asked to bring all medications they were currently tak-
ing to the mobile examination center. The medications were 
recorded as free text without dosing. Participants who did not 
bring a statin to the examination were assumed to not be tak-
ing a statin. Because we lacked information on statin dosage, 
we defined atorvastatin and rosuvastatin as higher-intensity 
statins and simvastatin, pravastatin, lovastatin, or fluvastatin 
as lower-intensity statins. Individual statins and other lipid-
lowering medications (fibrates, ezetimibe, cholestyramine, 
niacin) were reported separately. In addition to documented 
statin use, we also reported rates of self-reported use of any 
lipid-lowering medication based on participants’ responses 
to the following questions: “To lower your blood choles-
terol, have you ever been told by a doctor or other health 
professional to take prescribed medicine?” and “Are you 
now following this advice to take prescribed medicine?” Self-
reported awareness of hypercholesterolemia was assessed by

affirmative responses to the following question: “Have you 
ever been told by a doctor or other health professional that 
your blood cholesterol level was high?” Cholesterol screening 
within the past 5 years was determined via self-report.
Missing Data
Of the 42 
471 individuals included in the sample, 58.5% were 
missing LDL-C levels and 0.3% and 36.1% were missing data 
on personal and family history of premature ASCVD, respec-
tively. Participants with missing LDL-C levels were more likely 
to have normal glucose testing (63.6% versus 44.5%) but less 
likely to be normotensive (33.7% versus 37.4%) than par-
ticipants with nonmissing LDL-C. Differences in other demo-
graphic and clinical characteristics were minimal. In addition, 
there were no differences in the prevalence of cholesterol 
screening or self-reported awareness between participants 
with missing and nonmissing LDL-C.
Missing covariate data were otherwise minimal with 14.2% 
of participants missing data on 1 variable, 2.5% on 2 variables, 
and 5.5% on ≥3 variables. Because of incomplete data for 
some of the DLC criteria, in particular, LDL-C levels and family 
history of early ASCVD, missing data were multiply imputed 
(n=10 data sets) by using a Markov chain Monte Carlo method 
to account for missing values for the DLC criteria and for model 
covariates. All variables included in the multivariable analyses 
with any missing data were imputed by using the same strat-
egy. Given the large number of adults with missing LDL-C cri-
teria, we also repeated the analyses restricted to those with 
available LDL-C (see Statistical Analyses below). Outcome data 
were not imputed and were missing in 29.7%, 23.3%, 0%, 
and 34% of the screening, awareness, documented statin, and 
self-reported lipid-lowering medication variables.
Statistical Analyses
Data were analyzed by using the survey procedures in SAS 
version 9.4 (SAS Institute Inc) to account for the complex sur-
vey design used in NHANES.20 We estimated the prevalence 
of definite/probable FH and severe dyslipidemia in the general 
US population. Rates of cholesterol screening, awareness, and 
lipid-lowering medication use (documented and self-reported) 
were calculated among 3 groups: (1) individuals with definite/
probable FH, (2) individuals with severe dyslipidemia, and (3) 
the general population. Rates of screening, awareness, and 
medication use were compared between individuals with def-
inite/probable FH and the other 2 groups by using Rao-Scott 
modified χ2 tests. Trends in statin use from 1999 to 2000 to 
2013 to 2014 were examined for the 3 comparison groups.
Multivariable logistic regression was used to examine 
sociodemographic and clinical correlates of hypercholesterol-
emia awareness and statin treatment among individuals with 
severe dyslipidemia (LDL-C ≥190 mg/dL) regardless of FH. 
Given the small number of adults with definite/probable FH, 
we were unable to examine predictors of hypercholesterol-
emia awareness and statin use separately in this population. 
Covariates were selected for inclusion in the model using a 
backward elimination approach and retained in the model 
if P<0.05. For all analyses, we used the survey procedures 
(PROC SURVEYFREQ, SURVEYMEANS, SURVEYLOGISTIC) in 
the imputed data sets and then used PROC MIANALYZE to 
combine the results with adjusted variances on the 10 imputed 
data sets. Results were extrapolated to the US population by 
using the Current Population Survey according to the NHANES 
analytic guidelines.20 Sensitivity analyses included (1) restrict-
ing the analysis to those with available LDL-C and excluding 
participants with missing personal (n=12) or family (n=15 
315) 
history of early ASCVD, and (2) varying the LDL-C multiplier for 
statin therapy based on whether a lower- or higher-intensity 
statin was used (1.21 and 1.63, respectively).26 For both sensi-
tivity analyses, we repeated analyses for definite/probable FH, 
hypercholesterolemia awareness, and statin use.
RESULTS
The sample included 42 471 NHANES participants rep-
resenting 212 million US adults aged ≥20 from 1999 
to 2014. Approximately 14 million adults, or 6.6% 
(standard error [SE], 0.2%) of the population, had se-
vere dyslipidemia (LDL-C ≥190 mg/dL), and of these, 
1 million adults (7.2% [SE, 0.5%]) met the DLC crite-
ria for definite/probable FH (Figure I in the online-only 
Data Supplement). Overall, individuals with definite/
probable FH accounted for 0.47% (SE, 0.03%) of the 
total population (definite, 0.03% [SE, 0.01%]; prob-
able, 0.44% [SE, 0.04%]) (Table I in the online-only 
Data Supplement).
Sociodemographic characteristics and cardiovascular 
risk factors for the population stratified by LDL-C levels 
and FH criteria are provided in Table 1. In comparison 
with the general population, adults with definite/prob-
able FH were more likely to be born in the United States 
and to have comorbid diabetes mellitus or hyperten-
sion. Consistent with the DLC criteria, they were also 
more likely to have a personal or family history of early 
ASCVD. Adults with severe dyslipidemia (with or with-
out FH) were more likely to be older and to have comor-
bid obesity relative to the general population.
Rates of cholesterol screening and awareness were 
high (>80%) among adults with definite/probable FH 
and adults with severe dyslipidemia, but moderate in 
the general population (Figure 1). Adults with definite/
probable FH were more likely to have been screened 
and to be aware of their hyperlipidemia than those 
with severe dyslipidemia. In contrast, statin use was 
uniformly low; only 52.3% (SE, 8.2%) of adults with 
definite/probable FH and 37.6% (SE, 1.2%) of adults 
with severe dyslipidemia were on a documented statin 
(Figure 2). Less than half of those on statins (30.3% 
for definite/probable FH and 37.4% for severe dyslipid-
emia) were prescribed a higher-intensity statin. Rates of 
individual statin use and documented nonstatin lipid-
lowering medications are provided in Figures II and III 
in the online-only Data Supplement. Although rates of 
self-reported lipid-lowering medication use were higher

emia) than the general population, it is unclear which 
medications (ie, statin, nonstatin, or over-the-counter 
supplement) were included in this determination.
The prevalence of statin use in adults with definite/
probable FH, in adults with severe dyslipidemia, and in 
the general population increased over time (Figure 3). 
Among individuals with severe dyslipidemia, only 
29.4% (SE, 3.4%) were taking statins in 1999 to 2000 
in comparison with 47.7% (SE, 3.6%) in 2013 to 2014. 
There was significant variability in the prevalence of 
statin use over time among adults with definite/prob-
able FH, likely because of the small sample size; how-
ever, there appeared to be a trend toward increasing 
statin use over time.

with severe dyslipidemia are shown in Tables 2 and 3. 
Because of the small sample size, we were unable to 
repeat these analyses for adults with definite/probable 
FH. Factors independently associated with hypercho-
lesterolemia awareness included older age, absence of 
poverty, having a usual source of health care, obesity, 
diabetes mellitus, and having a personal history of early 
ASCVD (Table 2). Similar factors were associated with 
statin use including older age, being fully insured, hav-
ing a usual source of care, diabetes mellitus, hyperten-
sion, and having a personal history of early ASCVD (Ta-
ble 3). It is notable that race, education, and birthplace 
were not associated with either hypercholesterolemia 
awareness or statin use.
Rates of cholesterol screening, awareness, and lip-
id-lowering medication use among adults with severe 
dyslipidemia stratified by those factors associated with 
statin use (age, insurance status, usual source of health 
care, diabetes mellitus, and personal history of early 
ASCVD) are presented in Figure IV in the online-only 
Data Supplement. The discrepancy between cholesterol 
screening and treatment rates was most pronounced 
in younger patients, uninsured patients, and patients 
without a usual source of care. Among adults aged 20 
to 39 years, 62% reported cholesterol screening in the 
past 5 years, and 64% reported awareness of having 
hypercholesterolemia, but only 13% were on a docu-
mented statin. In contrast, >85% of adults aged ≥60 
years had been screened and were aware of their hy-
percholesterolemia, and 51% were on a documented 
statin. Similarly, only 29% of uninsured adults report-
ing recent screening were taking a statin in comparison 
with 48% of fully insured adults (Figure IV in the online-
only Data Supplement).
Sensitivity analyses resulted in findings similar to the 
primary analyses. Limiting the analyses to those with 
measured LDL-C and nonmissing personal or fam-
ily history of early ASCVD yielded a lower prevalence 
of definite/probable FH (0.33% [SE, 0.06%]) and se-
vere dyslipidemia (5.1% [SE, 0.3%]). However, rates of 
cholesterol screening, awareness, and statin use were 
similar to those in the full analysis (Table II in the online-
only Data Supplement). When analyses were repeated 
varying the LDL-C multiplier for lower- versus higher-
intensity statin use, the prevalence of definite/probable 
FH (0.48% [SE, 0.04%]) and severe dyslipidemia (6.4% 
[SE, 0.2%]) was similar to the primary analyses. Like-
wise, rates of cholesterol screening, awareness, and 
statin use were similar to the primary analyses, but a 
greater percentage of adults were taking a higher-in-
tensity versus lower-intensity statin as expected (Table 
III in the online-only Data Supplement).
DISCUSSION
In this nationally representative, cross-sectional analysis 
of the US adult population, we found that 0.47% of 
the adult US population has definite/probable FH (or 1 
in 212 individuals) but observed a large disconnect be-
tween screening and treatment rates in adults with def-
inite/probable FH and adults with severe dyslipidemia. 
Although rates of cholesterol screening and awareness 
approached 90% in adults with definite/probable FH, 
only about half of these patients were taking a docu-
mented statin at the time of assessment, and only 30% 
of those on statins were taking a higher-intensity statin. 
Rates of statin use were even lower among adults with 
severe dyslipidemia. Although rates of statin use in 
adults with FH and severe dyslipidemia appear to be 
increasing over the past decade, there remains substan-
tial room for improvement with younger and uninsured 
adults at greatest risk of being undertreated.
Our findings are consistent with those of prior stud-
ies demonstrating suboptimal rates of statin prescrip-
tion in patients with heterozygous FH or severe dyslip-
idemia. Using data from a single Midwest healthcare

system, Knickelbine et al11 found that only two thirds of 
patients with heterozygous FH had been prescribed a 
statin, and only half of those on statins were adequate-
ly treated. Moreover, they found that among those not 
prescribed statins, 73% had no documented statin in-
tolerance, suggesting significant room for improvement 
in both initiating and augmenting statin therapy to 
therapeutic levels. Similarly, another study performed in 
ambulatory care centers throughout the United States 
found that only two thirds of patients with a docu-
mented LDL-C level ≥190 mg/dL had been prescribed a 
statin, and statin prescriptions were highly dependent 
on other comorbid conditions such as diabetes mellitus 
or prior ASCVD.9 Rates of statin use in our study were 
lower than those of studies in ambulatory care settings, 
likely because we were able to capture adults without a 
usual source of care who were less likely to be screened 
for hypercholesterolemia or to have received statin pre-
scriptions. Indeed, we found that having a usual source 
of care was a significant predictor of statin use among 
patients with severe dyslipidemia.
To our knowledge, only 2 studies have documented 
the prevalence of lipid-lowering medication use among 
adults with FH in the general population. Benn et al10 
used data from the Copenhagen General Population 
Study to identify rates of self-reported lipid-lowering 
medication use in adults with FH, defined using the 
DLC criteria. Consistent with our study, they found 
that only about half of adults with definite/probable FH 
were taking a lipid-lowering medication. In contrast, 
data from the CASCADE registry (Cascade Screening 
for Awareness and Detection) reported higher rates of 
statin (74.8%) and high-intensity statin (42.0%) ther-
apy among patients with heterozygous FH treated at 
lipid clinics in the United States.27 The higher rates re-
ported by the CASCADE registry likely stem from the 
select catchment area from which participants were 
drawn. Our study extends these findings to all US 
adults, explores rates of screening and hypercholester-
olemia awareness in conjunction with statin treatment, 
and identifies sociodemographic correlates of hyper-
cholesterolemia awareness and statin use in this high-
risk population.
We observed a disconnect between screening and 
treatment rates in adults with FH and adults with severe 
dyslipidemia. Over 80% of adults with FH or severe dys-
lipidemia reported recent cholesterol screening; how-
ever, only 52% of adults with FH and 38% of adults 
with severe dyslipidemia were taking a documented 
stain. Although the low statin rates may be attributable 
in part to lower screening rates in certain populations 
(eg, younger and uninsured adults), the disconnect 
between screening and treatment rates was most pro-
nounced in these populations. Studies have repeatedly 
shown that severe dyslipidemia and FH increase the rate 
of CHD by 5- to 13-fold, respectively14,16; however, with 
appropriate statin therapy, the risk of ASCVD is great-
ly reduced.17 In addition, cost-effectiveness analyses 
have shown sizeable cost savings with initiating statins 
across all levels of risk in patients with LDL-C >160 mg/
dL.28 The low rates of statin therapy, particularly among 
young adults, is of particular concern given the poten-
tial for long-term atherosclerotic plaque buildup and 
coronary events if LDL-C remains untreated.
Young adults aged 20 to 39 years may be at particu-
larly high risk of being undertreated given their lower 
rates of insurance (70.6% versus 87.3%) and having a 
usual source of care (40.3% versus 63.2%) in this study. 
In addition, young adults may be less likely to think that 
they are at risk of cardiovascular disease, and clinicians 
may be less likely to initiate statin therapy in this popu-
lation. Although the 2013 American College of Cardiol-
ogy and American Heart Association cholesterol guide-
lines in addition to FH-specific guidelines recommend 
aggressive pharmacological treatment including imme-
diate initiation of statins in adults with LDL-C ≥190 mg/
dL,29–32 it is possible that lifestyle modifications continue 
to be prescribed as an initial treatment before initiating 
statin therapy. Indeed, prior studies have shown that 
young adults are more likely to be prescribed lifestyle 
interventions than older adults, which may explain, 
in part, the large discrepancy between screening and 
treatment rates in this population.33 In addition, al-
though we excluded pregnant women, many women 
aged 20 to 39 years may be planning pregnancy or lac-
tating. Many providers may be reluctant to prescribe 
statins to women who may become pregnant given 
their contraindications with pregnancy.
Other explanations for the low statin use despite 
widespread screening may include statin intolerance 
or interactions with other medications; however, other 
studies have shown that statin intolerance accounts for 
only a small percentage of adults with FH not taking 
statins.11 In addition, poor follow-up and disjointed care 
likely explain much of the poor treatment rate in this 
population. Adults without insurance or who lacked a 
usual source of care were significantly less likely to be 
taking statins than fully insured adults or those receiv-
ing care in either a hospital or clinic setting, respectively. 
Nevertheless, statin rates remained low even among 
those who were fully insured or had a usual source of 
care (42.3% [SE, 1.3%] and 41.8% [SE, 1.4%], respec-
tively), suggesting that other factors besides inadequate 
follow-up contribute to suboptimal treatment rates.
Not surprisingly, we found that adults with severe 
dyslipidemia and either comorbid diabetes mellitus or 
a history of early ASCVD were significantly more likely 
to be prescribed statins or other lipid-lowering medi-
cations than those without other cardiovascular risk 
factors. Although both the original ATP III guidelines 
(Adult Treatment Panel III) and current guidelines for 
hypercholesterolemia management recommend initia-

tion of statin therapy in patients with LDL-C ≥190 mg/
dL regardless of other risk factors, they also emphasize 
the importance of drug therapy for secondary preven-
tion of coronary events in patients with CHD or CHD 
risk equivalents such as diabetes mellitus and recom-
mend initiating lipid-lowering medications at lower 
LDL-C levels for patients with these conditions.34 
Moreover, the American Diabetes Association rec-
ommends the initiation of statin therapy in all adults 
with diabetes mellitus over the age of 40 and adults 
<40 years of age with even mild elevations in LDL-C.35 
This increased emphasis on early initiation of statins 
in adults with diabetes mellitus or early ASCVD, com-
bined with close follow-up and comprehensive care 
programs for individuals with diabetes mellitus, likely 
explains the higher rates of statin therapy in these pa-
tients.
Limitations of this study include the following. First, 
the definition of definite/probable FH was based on 
modified clinical criteria rather than genotyping. Al-
though FH is a known genetic disorder, between 20% 
and 70% of patients are mutation-negative.36–38 Both 
the full DLC criteria and the modified version used 
in this study have previously been used in popula-
tion studies to estimate the prevalence and burden of 
FH.12,15 As with any clinical criteria used to estimate a 
genetic diagnosis, the possibility for misclassification 
exists. Indeed, we found that adults with concurrent 
diabetes mellitus or hypertension were more likely to be 
identified as having definite/probable FH over unlikely/
possible FH, suggesting that there may be some degree 
of misclassification across groups. Nevertheless, we es-
timate that the degree of misclassification is minimal 
given that other studies found slightly higher rates of 
diabetes mellitus and obesity in patients with DLC-de-
fined FH with genetic analysis adjudication.10 Second, 
cholesterol screening, awareness, and treatment rates 
were estimated from a self-reported questionnaire that 
may be subject to imperfect recall or social desirability 
bias. Third, statin use may be underestimated if partici-
pants neglected or refused to show medications to the 
interviewer. To guard against this, NHANES interviews 
are conducted in the home. Fourth, we lacked informa-
tion on statin dosages and therefore were unable to dif-
ferentiate high-dose atorvastatin (40–80 mg) and rosu-
vastatin (20–40 mg) from low-dose atorvastatin (10–20 
mg) and rosuvastatin (5–10 mg). As a result, we may 
have overestimated the percentage of adults on these 
higher-intensity statins. In addition, several adults may 
have been taking higher doses of simvastatin (80 mg) 
before the 2011 Food and Drug Administration warn-
ings. Fifth, we were unable to differentiate between 
failure to prescribe statins and participant nonadher-
ence among those participants not taking statins. Sixth, 
we assessed participant access to care including health 
insurance, income, and healthcare use at a single time 
point, which may not accurately reflect healthcare 
 
utilization and access over time as participants move in 
and out of insurers and providers. Seventh, we did not 
include children or adolescents <20 years in the sample. 
Screening and treatment may be even lower in this age 
group. Finally, >50% of the population were missing 
data on LDL-C. To address this issue, we first imputed 
the data using a multiple imputations approach and 
then repeated the analyses excluding participants with 
missing data. The restricted analyses showed nearly 
identical rates of cholesterol screening, awareness, and 
statin treatment as the full analyses. Although multiple 
imputations do not account for systematic missingness, 
there were minimal differences between adults with 
missing and nonmissing LDL-C for the demographic 
and clinical variables examined. Nevertheless, some 
individuals may have been misclassified as having se-
vere dyslipidemia or definite/probable FH in the primary 
analyses.
In a nationally representative population of US 
adults with FH and severe dyslipidemia, the rates of 
statin and other lipid-lowering medications remain 
suboptimal despite high rates of self-reported choles-
terol screening and awareness. This study highlights 
an opportunity and an imperative to improve statin 
treatment rates in this high-risk population. Although 
rates of statin prescription have been steadily increas-
ing over time, the rate of growth over the past de-
cade has been slow, and there remains a significant 
gap in treatment rates. Younger and uninsured adults 
with severe dyslipidemia in addition to those without 
a usual source of care are significantly less likely to 
be prescribed statins, highlighting the need for com-
munity-based interventions to target these adults with 
limited access to care. The low rate of statin use in 
young adults is of particular relevance given the early 
onset of ASCVD in adults with FH. Additional stud-
ies are needed to better understand how to close the 
gap between screening and treatment in this high-risk 
population and improve treatment rates among indi-
viduals with limited access to care.
