Abstract
We describe the first comprehensive analysis of the midgut metabolome of Aedes aegypti,
the primary mosquito vector for arboviruses such as dengue, Zika, chikungunya and yellow
fever viruses. Transmission of these viruses depends on their ability to infect, replicate and
disseminate from several tissues in the mosquito vector. The metabolic environments within
these tissues play crucial roles in these processes. Since these viruses are enveloped, viral
replication, assembly and release occur on cellular membranes primed through the manipu-
lation of host metabolism. Interference with this virus infection-induced metabolic environ-
ment is detrimental to viral replication in human and mosquito cell culture models. Here we
present the first insight into the metabolic environment induced during arbovirus replication
in Aedes aegypti. Using high-resolution mass spectrometry, we have analyzed the temporal
metabolic perturbations that occur following dengue virus infection of the midgut tissue. This
is the primary site of infection and replication, preceding systemic viral dissemination and
transmission. We identified metabolites that exhibited a dynamic-profile across early-, mid-
and late-infection time points. We observed a marked increase in the lipid content. An
increase in glycerophospholipids, sphingolipids and fatty acyls was coincident with the kinet-
ics of viral replication. Elevation of glycerolipid levels suggested a diversion of resources
during infection from energy storage to synthetic pathways. Elevated levels of acyl-carni-
tines were observed, signaling disruptions in mitochondrial function and possible diversion
of energy production. A central hub in the sphingolipid pathway that influenced dihydrocera-
mide to ceramide ratios was identified as critical for the virus life cycle. This study also
resulted in the first reconstruction of the sphingolipid pathway in Aedes aegypti. Given

Author summary
The Aedes aegypti mosquito transmits arboviruses that cause dengue, Zika, chikungunya
and yellow fever. These viruses are endemic in tropical and subtropical regions of the
world placing 2.5 billion people at risk of infection. Transmission is critically dependent
upon the replication of these viruses in both human and mosquito hosts. Successful viral
replication is greatly influenced by the biochemical environment of the host cell or tissue
and flaviviruses rearrange this environment to benefit their needs. Host-cell derived
metabolites such as lipids, sugars and amino acids are utilized to produce progeny virions,
help evade the host immune system and enable successful completion of the life cycle. In
this study, we applied high-resolution mass spectrometry to understand the alteration of
the biochemical landscape of the mosquito during infection by dengue virus. We focused
on the mosquito midgut, as this is the initial site of infection. We identified several metab-
olites that exhibited dynamic profiles during the course of viral infection and replication.
By pinpointing biochemical “choke points” required for viral replication, we can devise
strategies that will stall virus replication in the mosquito and prevent its transmission to
humans.
Introduction
The transmission cycle of dengue viruses (DENV) require a human host and mosquito vector.
Mosquitoes acquire DENV via feeding on the blood of an infected human. The blood meal is
deposited in the midgut of the mosquito and infection is first established in the midgut epithe-
lium [1]. While digestion of the blood meal is complete within 48 hours [2], viral replication in
the midgut tissue reaches its peak only at 7–8 days post-blood meal (pbm) ingestion [1]. Subse-
quently, the virus disseminates from the midgut and infects other tissues including the fat
body and salivary glands. Approximately 10–14 days pbm the salivary glands become infected
and the virus can be transmitted in the saliva to a human when the mosquito acquires another
blood meal. Since the successful transmission of this virus depends greatly upon its ability to
replicate efficiently in several mosquito tissues, the local biochemical and physical environ-
ment of each tissue plays a critical role in virus propagation.
In both human and mosquito cells, lipids play an integral role in the life cycle of DENV [3–
7]. Host-derived membranes are incorporated into a lipid envelope that surrounds the capsid
protein and genomic RNA of DENV particles [8]. This membranous structure facilitates virus
release from infected cells by budding into the endoplasmic reticulum and re-entry into new
cells through fusion of virus-host membranes [7, 9, 10]. Additionally, electron tomography has
revealed that significant rearrangements of host cell membrane architecture occur upon
DENV infection [4, 7, 11–13]. Virus-induced membrane structures are required as platforms
for virus replication and assembly and protect replicating genomes from antiviral defense
mechanisms of the host. They have been identified in DENV-infected human and mosquito
cells and the midgut epithelium and salivary glands of Culex mosquitoes infected with West
Nile virus [14]. This intracellular membrane reorganization imposes a significant metabolic

 cost to the host cell. It requires activation of biosynthetic processes, and the trafficking and
degradation of lipids and other related molecules. Our previous studies investigated the pertur-
bation of lipid homeostasis in C6/36 mosquito cells following infection with DENV [5]. We
identified lipids involved in maintaining the stability, permeability and curvature of mem-
branes, as well as bioactive lipid molecules that were significantly changed upon infection. Spe-
cifically, a burst of glycerophospholipids was observed coincident with viral replication
kinetics. This burst of lipids was attributed to the activity of fatty acid synthase (FAS), a key
enzyme in glycerophospholipid biosynthesis. Inhibition of this enzyme was detrimental for
DENV replication in both human and mosquito cells [5, 6]. Collectively, these data demon-
strate that lipids play critical roles in DENV infection in cell culture models.
Although lipid biochemistry has been studied in mosquitoes for several years, very little is
known about the relationship between virus and mosquito host and the alteration of intracel-
lular lipids that underpins infection capacity. In this study, we used high-resolution mass spec-
trometry to explore metabolic changes in the midgut of Ae. aegypti exposed to DENV-
containing blood meals as this tissue represents the crucial site of initial viral replication.
Using a time course study, we compared metabolic profiles of infected and uninfected midguts
at early-, mid- (peak viral replication) and late time points post-infection. Our results demon-
strate significant fluctuations in molecules that function as membrane building blocks, bioac-
tive messengers, energy storage molecules and intermediates in lipid biosynthesis and lipolysis
pathways. Presumably these changes represent both manipulation of cellular resources for
viral replication as well as the cellular response to infection. They may result from either de
novo biosynthesis or the consumption/conversion of metabolites. Additionally, import/export
may contribute to the perturbation of metabolite pools. Import pathways are specifically
important in the mosquito for molecules such as cholesterol and its derivatives since they can-
not be synthesized de novo [15, 16]. Many unidentified metabolites (not found in currently
available databases that include animal, plant, fungal and bacterial metabolites and synthetic
compounds) were also significantly perturbed during virus infection and may represent mos-
quito-specific metabolites that have not yet been annotated. The flaviviruses transmitted by
this vector share similar replication mechanisms; identifying metabolic bottlenecks that condi-
tion vector competence and transmission of these pathogens could be exploited for novel
transmission-blocking interventions for control of globally important diseases.
Results
DENV type 2 infection of the Ae. aegypti mosquito vector
To profile the alterations in the metabolic environment of the mosquito midgut over time
post-blood feeding and during the course of DENV infection in the mosquito vector, Ae.
aegypti Chetumal strain mosquitoes were fed an infectious blood meal containing DENV type
2 strain Jamaica-1409 (JAM-1409; blood titer 1x107 PFU/mL) or exposed to a noninfectious
blood meal as a negative control (S1 Fig). Midguts were dissected from the mosquitoes on days
3, 7 and 11 pbm representing early viral infection in the midgut (day 3), high replication activ-
ity in the midgut with early dissemination to the salivary glands (day 7), and high replication
activity in salivary glands and other tissues with virus being cleared from the midgut (day 11).
Immediately after dissection, individual midguts were tested for DENV RNA by qRT-PCR
(Fig 1A). To ensure that the metabolic profile of the midgut tissues accurately represented the
infected environment, every individual midgut was evaluated by qRT-PCR for DENV RNA
and only infected tissues were pooled. On day 3 pbm, viral genomes were detected in 55% of
the dissected midguts, and on days 7 and 11 pbm, detection increased to 73% and 76% respec-
tively. Plaque assays of whole mosquito homogenates harvested on day 11 pbm (n = 30)

 indicated that 60% of mosquitoes showed detectable infectious virus averaging 8.5x103 PFU/
mL (Fig 1B). These were similar infection rates to those reported previously by Salazar et al,
2007 [1]. Two independent pools of ~100 tissues were included for each treatment group and
time point representing a total of 200 biological samples. The metabolic profiles observed in
the infected tissues represent true biological deviations corresponding to the infected state. It
should be noted however, that estimation of variance and statistical power are compromised
by the small sample sizes since the maximum limit of samples acquirable in order to maintain
metabolite integrity at a given time point is limited.
LC-MS data analysis of mosquito midguts following DENV infection
Mosquito metabolites in both polar and non-polar phase extracts were analyzed by LC-MS in
both positive and negative ionization modes to obtain the most comprehensive coverage

tested for the presence of viral RNA by qRT-PCR. (A) Percent of virus-RNA positive midguts are shown above the bar
graphs. (B) Infectious viral titers of a representative subset (n = 30) of whole mosquitoes harvested on day 11 pbm were

 possible. Experimental data from each extract in each mode were analyzed separately by the
workflow described in materials and methods and shown in S1 Fig. Only features (molecular
identities defined by a unique mass to charge ratio, m/z and retention time) detected in both
pools (representing 200 biological replicates) were considered ‘present’ in the samples. For the
midguts, a total of 6,103 molecular features from all modes, treatments and time-points pbm
were detected. These features were subjected to statistical analysis to compare the differences
in metabolite abundance between DENV-infected and uninfected midguts at each time point
pbm. The features that showed statistically significant differences in abundance (|log2 fold
change|) � 1 and p-value < 0.05; total of 936 features) were identified using LIPID MAPS,
HMDB, and Metlin databases. Approximately 39% of the significantly different features (363
molecules) were identifiable to an accuracy of < 6 parts per million (ppm) (Table 1 and S1
Table). About 93% of identified and significantly different features (341 molecules) have recog-
nizable biological relevance. The metabolites detected in the non-polar phase from both nega-
tive and positive ionization modes comprised glycerophospholipids (GPs), sphingolipids
(SPs), glycerolipids (GLs), sterols, fatty acyls, acyl-carnitines, prenols, polyketides, amino acids
and peptides and other organic compounds. The metabolites detected in polar phases from
both detection modes also contained the above molecular species with the exception of GLs
and contained nucleosides instead. All nomenclatures and categories for lipids are based on
the LIPID MAPS comprehensive classification system [17].
Specific lipids levels are elevated during DENV replication in the midgut of
Ae. aegypti
To explore the metabolic environment in the mosquito midgut during DENV infection, we
compared the metabolite repertoire of DENV-infected midguts to uninfected controls. A sum-
mary of the data is shown in Fig 2 and S1 Table. Of 6,103 features detected, 936 features (15%)
have differential abundance in DENV-infected midguts compared to uninfected controls in at
least one time point (Fig 2A and 2B). The Venn diagram shows the numbers of molecular fea-
tures with differential abundance in the midgut (|log2 fold change| � 1 and adjusted p-
value < 0.05) upon DENV infection on days 3, 7, and 11 pbm. The profiles of 5,167 features
were unaltered at any day post-infection (Fig 2A and 2B). Among the features with altered lev-
els, 274, 283 and 114 features showed differential abundance only on day 3, 7 or 11 pbm,
respectively, whereas 98 features showed differential abundance in all 3 days (Fig 2B).
Identified metabolites: About 39% of features (363 out of 936) with differential abundance
were identifiable through use of three metabolite databases and the putative identifications
were categorized into different metabolite classes. The metabolic relationships between the
lipid classes are mapped in Fig 2C. Fatty acyl-CoA can be synthesized de novo. It is a precursor
that can be modified and incorporated into more complex lipid molecules such as glyceropho-
spholipids, sphingolipids, glycerolipids and sterols. On the other hand, fatty acyl-CoA can be
degraded through β-oxidation when cells require energy. The overall trend of lipid molecular
levels that changed upon DENV infection is summarized in Fig 2D. A majority of the metabo-
lites were unchanged (had intensity changes that are less than 2-fold upon infection or
p � 0.05), while a majority of those that showed greater than 2-fold changes in intensity had
higher abundances upon DENV infection (Fig 2D and S1 Table, identified tab). Only 61 out of
363 features (~17%) decreased in abundance during DENV infection.
Unidentified metabolites: Interestingly, a large number (~61%) of metabolites that were dif-
ferentially altered in abundance during DENV infection were unidentified (S1 Table, unidenti-
fied tab). A majority of these unidentified metabolites had elevated abundance in the DENV-
infected samples compared to uninfected controls at all three time points post-infection. These

 metabolites represent a potential resource since they highlight molecules that are not found in
currently available databases that include animal, plant, bacterial and fungal metabolites as
well as synthetic compounds. Therefore, they could be compounds unique to Diptera, mosqui-
toes or Aedes species that are yet to be annotated. Given their importance to DENV infection,
they should be exploited in the future as possible transmission-blocking control points.
Glycerophospholipids (GPs)
GPs are major components of cellular membranes. GPs are composed of a polar head group, a
phosphate group and two fatty acyl chains. The specific composition of GPs in a membrane
influences membrane fluidity, leakiness, nutrient exchange, assembly and function of signaling
protein complexes and vesicular traffic [18–21]. In insects, the GP composition of membranes
also affects tolerance to changing environmental conditions [22]. Pathogenic or endosymbiont
infections also drive changes in the intracellular environment and could influence the regula-
tion of GP content in membranes [5, 23–26]. As a point of reference, the metabolic pathways
of the major classes of GPs are shown in Fig 3A. Our study identified 565 species of GPs in Ae.
aegypti midguts with 87 species that were altered upon DENV-infection. The alteration land-
scape and distribution of the different GPs are shown in Fig 3B and 3C.
Minimal enrichment of GP species and levels can be observed on day 3 pbm, during the ini-
tial establishment of viral infection in the midgut (Fig 3B). This enrichment was significantly
enhanced on days 7 and 11 pbm. These observations were coincident with known viral infec-
tion dynamics (peak viral replication in the midgut on day 7 and viral dissemination to other
tissues and clearance from the midgut by day 11) [1]. The signaling GPs, PIs, were the most
diverse (Fig 3C) closely followed by PGs, important as surfactants and precursors of cardioli-
pins in mitochondrial membranes. PCs, PEs and PSs, which are primary components of most
cellular membranes were also increased during infection especially at the peak of viral replica-
tion (day 7 pbm). Interestingly, levels of most of the lyso- or short chain GPs were decreased
during infection.
Glycerolipids (GLs)
GLs, including mono-, di- and triacylglycerols (MAG, DAG and TAG), are critical effectors of
energy metabolism in insects and mammals. Fatty acids absorbed from a digested blood meal
or synthesized de novo from a sugar meal can be converted into DAG and TAG that can be
transported to the fat body for energy storage or the ovaries for vitellogenesis [27–31] (Fig 4).
DAG is also an important intermediate in GP synthesis [18, 32] and a critical second messen-
ger regulating cell proliferation, survival, mitochondrial physiology, gene expression and apo-
ptosis [33, 34]. Seventy species of GLs were identified in our study, of which eight GLs were
significantly changed in abundance upon infection. Most of the MAG, DAG and TAG levels

 were higher during early time points (day 3 and 7 pbm) in DENV-infected midguts (Fig 4).
This might be a result of transportation of these lipids from storage tissues to support the
demand for lipids during infection [35, 36]. Interestingly, the level of cytidinediphosphate
(CDP-DAG (37:1)) were elevated only during the later phases of infection (days 7 and 11
pbm). CDP-DAG is a precursor for GP synthesis (Fig 3A). As a result, increased CDP-DAG
(37:1) might support the high demand for GP synthesis on days 7 and 11 pbm during virus
infection.
Sphingolipids (SPs)
SPs are bioactive molecules that play important roles in the structural composition of cellular
membranes and numerous cell-signaling pathways and are critical in microbial pathogenesis
[22, 37–40]. De novo synthesis of SPs occurs in the endoplasmic reticulum through the con-
densation of L-serine and palmitoyl-CoA to form ceramide (Cer) via several intermediates
[41, 42]. Cer is a precursor for the biosynthesis of several complex SPs such as sphingomyelin
(SM) and glycosylceramides or the production of fatty acids and sphingosines through its
hydrolysis [43–45]. The SP pathway has been highlighted in many studies in mammalian cells
[37] and in mosquito cells [5] as a lipid metabolic pathway altered by flavivirus infection. In
Fig 4. GL levels were dynamically altered upon DENV infection of mosquito midguts. The abundances of GL species detected in
mosquito midguts were mapped to the GL biosynthesis pathway. GL molecules that were significantly altered in abundance are
shown in boxplots. Feature that were detected but did not change in abundance are listed in the grey boxes. The abundance of
metabolites detected in DENV-infected samples is shown in red and uninfected samples in black. Individual sample pools are

 this study, using the identified SPs from both infected and uninfected mosquito tissues we
reconstructed a significant proportion of the SP metabolic pathway for Ae. aegypti (Fig 5). Sev-
eral members of the pathway were identified at all three time points in both biological repli-
cates of the infected and uninfected tissues. We observed accumulations of several SPs such as
sphinganine, sphinganine-1-PC, sphingosine, Cer and hexosylceramide that were elevated in
DENV-infected midguts on days 3, 7 and/or 11 pbm. GP-Cers, especially PE-Cers, are sphin-
gomyelin analogues. They function as the principal membrane sphingolipids in Drosophila,
which lacks sphingomyelin synthase [46]. In mosquito midguts, we found decreased abun-
dance of PE-Cer (d32:2(2OH)) upon DENV infection on day 3 pbm but an increase in the lev-
els of PE-Cer(d33:2(2OH)), PE-Cer(d36:1), PE-Cer(d36:3(2OH)) and PE-Cer(d36:2(2OH)) on
day 7 and/or 11 pbm. Interestingly, sphingomyelin was found in Ae. aegypti mosquito midguts
and in cells in culture (Fig 5 and S2–S4 Figs); however, the levels of sphingomyelin were not
changed upon DENV infection at any of the time points tested. Glycosylated ceramides (hexo-
sylceramide and hexosylceramidesulfate) play critical roles in modulating cellular signaling
and gene expression resulting in changes in processes such as proliferation, apoptosis, autop-
hagy and endocytosis [47]. The abundance of the neutral glycosphingolipid, FMC-6(d40:1
(2-OH)), was increased on all days and HexCer(d40:1(2OH) sulfate was increased on day 3 fol-
lowing DENV infection (Fig 5).
Changes in the Cer-DHCer balance impair DENV infection
In this study, we identified a large number of SPs with significantly altered abundance follow-
ing DENV infection of mosquito midguts. Important biological roles of the SP pathway are
determined by conversion from DHCer to Cer, the central precursor of diverse SPs. The bal-
ance between Cer and DHCer concentrations plays a critical role in physiologically regulating
properties such as membrane architecture, fluidity and function [48]. Therefore, we investi-
gated if alteration of Cer or DHCer levels and the Cer/DHCer ratio had an effect on DENV
infection, using Ae. aegypti-derived (Aag2) cultured cells, which are readily amenable to loss of
function studies. Cells were treated with 4-hydroxyphenyl retinamide (4HPR) or long double
stranded RNA (dsRNA) to inhibit activity of or knock down expression of sphingolipid Δ-4
desaturase (DEGS, VectorBase: AAEL013047, NCBI:LOC5577178), the enzyme that catalyzes
conversion of DHCer to Cer, the final step in the de novo biosynthesis of Cer (Fig 5), and thus
should greatly influence the Cer/DHCer ratio [49]. 4HPR is a synthetic retinoid that activates
the Cer de novo synthesis pathway prior to DHCer synthesis, but inhibits the activity of DEGS
[50] (Fig 6A). Significant reduction of virus titer and genome replication were observed upon
4HPR treatment of Aag2 cells at non-cytotoxic concentrations (S2A–S2C Fig). We validated
the metabolic impact of 4HPR on sphingolipid metabolism using multiple reaction monitor-
ing (MRM) LC-MS/MS. We observed accumulation of Cer(d18:1/16:0), Cer(d18:1/18:0), Cer
(d18:1/24:1), and Cer(d18:1/26:1) and DHCer(d18:0/18:0) in cells following 4HPR treatment
(S2D Fig, lower). However, their accumulation did not alter the Cer/DHCer ratios (S2D Fig,
upper). None of the levels of long chain sphingoid bases Cer and DHCer with 16-carbon back-
bones were affected (S2E Fig). We also did not see changes in sphingosine (d18:1), sphingo-
sine-1-P (d18:1-P), sphinganine (d18:0) or SM levels following 4HPR treatment which is
expected as the enzymes that produces these molecules are not the primary targets of 4HPR
(S2F and S2G Fig). The effect of 4HPR on DENV replication therefore might not be due to a
direct effect on the Cer/DHCer ratios, but due to off target effects such as ROS, changes in bcl-
2, p53 mRNA expression and apoptosis [51]. A similar observation has been made in mamma-
lian cells [50].

 To validate that the reduction of DENV replication was caused by the loss of SP metabolites
or Cer/DHCer imbalance and not due to off-target effects of the inhibitor, the expression of
DEGS in Aag2 cells was transiently knocked down by RNA interference, using long dsRNA
(Fig 6B–6E). In DEGS knockdown (DEGS-KD) cells, DENV titer and genome replication were
significantly reduced compared to the GFP dsRNA (GFP-KD) negative control, but were simi-
lar to the DENV dsRNA (DENV-KD) positive control (Fig 6B and 6C). SP metabolic profiling
of the DEGS-KD cells compared to GFP-KD cells revealed striking reduction of Cer(d18:1/
18:0), DHCer(d18:0/20:0) and DHCer(d18:0/22:0) after DEGS-KD (Fig 6F and 6G, lower
panel). Interestingly, DEGS-KD also greatly altered the Cer/DHCer ratio for molecules with
18- and 16-carbon long chain sphingoid bases, especially those with very long fatty acyl chain
lengths (20:0–24:0) (Fig 6F and 6G, upper panel). These results indicated that perturbation of
the Cer-DHCer balance reduced both DENV genome replication and infectious virus forma-
tion. As expected we did not see changes in sphingosine (d18:1), sphingosine-1-P (d18:1-P),
sphinganine (d18:0) or SM levels during dsRNA treatment (S3 Fig). When DENV-infected
and uninfected Aag2 cells were compared for alterations in the SP pathway, we observed a sig-
nificant increase in the abundance of Cer(d18:1/20:0) and Cer(d18:1/24:1) and DHCer(d18:0/
22:0) in infected cells, but a decrease in Cer(d16:1/16:1) in infected cells (S4A and S4B Fig,
lower). These changes did not, however, affect the Cer/DHCer ratio for very long fatty acyl
chain containing molecules (S4A and S4B Fig, upper). We did not see changes in sphingosine
(d18:1), sphingosine-1-P (d18:1-P), sphinganine (d18:0) or SM levels during dsRNA treatment
(S4C and S4D Fig).
Fatty acids and derivatives (Fatty acyls)
Fatty acyls can be acquired from the midgut digestion and absorption of a blood meal or can
be de novo synthesized from central carbon metabolism precursors [27, 52]. Fatty acids that
are covalently linked to coenzyme A, fatty acyl-CoAs, can be incorporated into complex lipids
such as GPs, SPs and GLs that have structural roles in membranes. In addition, free fatty acids
or fatty acyls that are linked to other functional groups can have critical roles in signaling,
energy homeostasis and the immune response in insects and mammals (e.g.: fatty amides and
eicosanoids) [53–55]. In this study, at least nine subclasses of fatty acyls were detected and
many of these had higher abundances in DENV-infected midguts compared to uninfected
controls in at least one time point pbm (S5 Fig and S1 Table). The molecules observed were
fatty amides, hydroxy fatty acids, free fatty acids, eicosanoids and leukotriene (i.e. immuno-
modulators), fatty-amines, glycosides, dicarboxylic acids, and keto-fatty acids. Fig 7 shows
molecules with significantly increased or decreased levels at least at one time point following
DENV infection and have known functions in immunomodulation (Fig 7A) and N-acylamides
and other fatty acyls whose accumulation is a marker for malfunction of fatty acid oxidation
(Fig 7B). Prostaglandins, leukotrienes, thromboxanes and lipoxins are eicosanoids that are
synthesized in various tissues. Eicosanoids are inflammatory mediator molecules have been
found to play several important roles in insect immunity [55]. In this study, three prostaglan-
dins (prostaglandin a2, prostaglandin d2, and PGD2-dihydroxypropanylamine) and one
thromboxane (dehydrodinor-TXB2) showed increased levels during DENV infection and one
leukotriene (leukotriene e4) decreased during DENV infection. Anti-inflammatory molecules
(resolvin d5 and epoxy-DHA) increased during DENV infection [56, 57]. Metabolites of

 linoleic acid that may regulate prostaglandin synthesis (HEPE, HpOTrE and TriHOME) also
increased upon DENV infection [58]. N-acylamides play important roles in endocannabinoid
signaling systems in mammals and have been detected and reported as potentially important
signaling molecules in Drosophila [59]. Elevated levels of these molecules are also observed in
the urine and blood of human patients with fatty acid oxidation disorders [60]. In our study,
we found that five N-acylamide molecules (e.g. N-arachidonoylglycine, myristoylglycine, N-
stearoylarginine, N-decanoylglycine, and N-undecanoylglycine) had increased levels and N-
heptanoylglycine displayed a decreased level in midguts during DENV infection (Fig 7B).
Acyl-carnitines
One of the most prominent observations in this study is the change in abundance of acyl-car-
nitines in midgut tissue after DENV infection (Fig 8). These molecules are intermediates that
shuttle fatty acyl-CoA from the cytoplasm into the mitochondria for β-oxidation and subse-
quent energy (ATP) production (Fig 8). A total of 54 acyl-carnitine molecules were detected in
the midgut metabolome. Following DENV infection, 26 acyl-carnitines had a significant
increase in abundance and only one had decreased abundance (Fig 8A). Interestingly, of those
that increased in abundance, 25 out of 26 molecules contained medium chain-length fatty
acyls of 4–12 carbons. The accumulation of acyl-carnitines with medium-length carbon chains
was reported to be a result of incomplete β-oxidation [61].
Sterol lipids
Sterol lipids are a group of cyclic organic compounds composed of 17 carbon atoms arranged
in a four-ring structure. In insects, cholesterol is a component of cellular membranes and a
precursor of the ecdysone hormone [15, 62–65]. However, insects cannot synthesize choles-
terol de novo but must absorb it from dietary sources and/or microflora [15, 16, 66]. During
infection of mammalian cells, cholesterol in the flavivirus envelope seems to be critical for
viral entry and fusion [67, 68]. It has also been shown that flaviviruses can manipulate cellular
cholesterol homeostasis to facilitate genome replication [69]. However, the role of cholesterol
in flavivirus replication in the mosquito vector has not been determined. In this study, we
detected 111 sterol lipid molecules. Many of these have no reported function in insects. Since
sterols in the mosquito are acquired from dietary sources (in this case, raisins, sucrose, sheep’s
blood and cell culture medium), we did not exclude sterol lipids identified as plant or other
animal from our analyses. Of the 111 molecules, 25 showed different levels of abundance dur-
ing DENV infection compared to controls (S1 Table). Twenty-one molecules increased during
infection while only four molecules decreased during infection. A majority of the changes
occurred on day 3 (10 molecules) and day 7 (14 molecules) pbm. Only one molecule showed
significant changes (decreased) on day 14 pbm.
Discussion
The dynamic metabolic environment of an organism is an indicator of physiological changes
that occur following exposure to varying environmental conditions. When arboviruses such as
DENV infect a mosquito vector, they must strike a delicate balance between metabolic
DEGS-KD (red) and GFP-KD cells (blue) using LC-MS/MS Multiple Reaction Monitoring (N = 3). (F) and (G) shows Cer and DHCer molecules with

Cer/DHCer species with the same fatty acyl chain lengths. These ratios highlight the Cer-DHCer imbalance caused by manipulation of DEGS gene
expression. Student’s t-test was applied for statistical analysis. � p < 0.05, �� p < 0.01, ��� p < 0.005, ���� p < 0.001.

 commensalism and competition to achieve persistent replication in mosquito tissues to allow
transmission to a new host. Here, we have explored the metabolic landscape of Ae. aegypti, the
primary vector of DENV, ZIKV, YFV and CHIKV, during infection with DENV. Our study
focused on the midgut, the site of initial viral replication prior to viral dissemination to other
tissues and transmission to the vertebrate host [1]. The observed biochemical changes high-
light specific metabolites that may be markers of infection. They may be required for viral rep-
lication or produced as part of the defensive response of the vector to the invading pathogen.
We have consistently observed a link between DENV infection and an increased abundance of
GPs; our previous work on DENV-infected human cells showed that fatty acid synthase (FAS),
a key enzyme required for fatty acid synthesis (essential pre-cursors of GP synthesis), is acti-
vated by the expression of virus-encoded nonstructural protein NS3, and relocates to sites of
viral RNA replication through interaction with NS3 [6]. Inhibition of FAS activity using C75
caused a reduction in viral replication and we observed this in both cultured human and mos-
quito cells [5, 6]. We profiled the metabolic changes upon C75 inhibition of FAS in mosquito
cells and demonstrated that the GP repertoire was directly reduced coincident with the reduc-
tion in viral replication. Therefore, in the cell culture models an abundance of GPs is required
for viral replication. The current study supports these observations and reveals that DENV
infection also significantly alters the abundance of GPs and other lipid-related molecules in
the midgut of the mosquito vector during infection (summarized in Fig 9). While our previous
studies showed that de novo synthesis of lipids plays an important role in DENV replication,
other processes such as lipolysis, lipid conversion/consumption or import/export may also
critically shape the metabolite pool observed in these infected tissues [70, 71].
Glycerophospholipids (GPs)
One of our most striking observation was the marked elevation of GP levels coincident with
the kinetics of viral replication in the midgut [1]. Digestion of the blood meal, is completed
within ~48 hours post-ingestion, and provides a major source of amino acids and fatty acids
used for the biosynthesis of macromolecules [74, 75]. These macromolecules are required for
vitellogenesis (yolk formation) and energy storage [29, 76–78]. In DENV-infected mosquitoes,
the rapid increase in GP content is observed at day 7 pbm when viral replication reaches its
peak in the midgut. While it is currently unknown if biosynthesis alone contributes to this
burst in GP content the increase is consistent with requirements for DENV replication within
human and mosquito cells in culture [5, 6]. Specifically, DENV infection induces a massive
expansion of intracellular membranes required for the assembly and function of viral replica-
tion complexes and assembly and release of enveloped progeny virions [4, 7]. This membrane
expansion is coincident with increased GP biosynthesis through the co-opted functions of
FAS, a key enzyme in the pathway. Electron microscopic studies have revealed similar mem-
brane expansions associated with the midgut of WNV-infected Culex mosquitoes but equiva-
lent studies have not been performed in Ae. aegypti infected with DENV [14].
Sphingolipids (SPs)
Reconstruction of the SP pathway in Ae. aegypti revealed significant conservation with that of
Homo sapiens, allowing us to identify a majority of orthologous metabolites in the pathway.
Importantly, most metabolites were identified in both pools of 100 midguts, at all time points
and in both infected and uninfected tissues confirming a significant presence in the midgut
metabolome. Additionally, we were also able to identify orthologous effector enzymes for a
majority of the SP metabolic pathways in our study using annotations in the AaegEL5 assem-
bly of the Ae. aegypti genome on VectorBase [79]. SPs are important components of lipid rafts

 in membranes that in mammalian systems, together with cholesterol support the assembly and
function of various protein signaling complexes [80]. Metabolites of SPs are well-studied sig-
naling molecules [41]. These lipids have been studied in Drosophila [23, 81, 82] and it has been
demonstrated that these lipids are critical for development, reproduction and maintenance of
tissue integrity in the fruit fly [83]. SPs have also been identified in Anopheles stephensi by spa-
tial mapping [84] and in Aedes [5] and Culex cells in culture [85]. However, the specific
Fig 9. DENV infection results in alteration of lipid homeostasis in infected Ae. aegypti. This study revealed that the abundance of lipids in six main lipid
metabolic pathways [72] was altered following DENV infection of the mosquito midgut (names of lipids that were altered in abundance during infection are
in black (bold) and lipids that remained unchanged are in grey). All of these pathways require fatty acyl-CoA (FA-CoA), activated fatty acids, as a precursor
for the synthesis of complex lipids (red). Names of enzymes involved in FA-CoA homeostasis are italicized (FAS, ACOT and ACSL). Previous studies by
Heaton et al, 2010 [6] and Perera et al, 2012 [5] have shown that DENV infection requires and can enhance the activity of FAS to synthesize in human and
mosquito cells. Ye et al, 2013 [73] have shown that Wolbachia, the insect endosymbiont used to control DENV transmission by Ae. aegypti mosquitoes can
increase FA-CoA catabolism by increasing the expression of ACOT enzymes. Therefore, FA-CoA metabolism represents a ‘hub’ that may control lipid
metabolic competition in the midgut that mediates the success of DENV replication. Abbreviations: ACC, acetyl-CoA carboxylase; ACSL, long-chain acyl-

 functionality of these lipids has not been extensively studied either in vitro or in vivo in mos-
quitoes. All viruses and most bacteria are incapable of SP synthesis and rely on the host to pro-
vide these lipids. The specific species of SPs that are increased in abundance during infection
could influence the balance between commensalism, competition and/or host damage [37,
86].
In our data, the most striking observation is that several SP metabolites that are precursors
or derivatives of Cer showed increased abundance in DENV-infected midguts compared to
controls. In Ae. aegypti-derived cells we observed a significant increase in the abundance of
select Cer and DHCer species and a reduction in other Cer species during infection. Impor-
tantly, altering the ratio of Cer to DHCer (through inhibition of DEGS) significantly reduced
viral genome replication and infectious virus release, highlighting the importance of this hub
for infection. In our previous studies in C6/36 Ae. albopictus mosquito cells, we also observed
elevated levels of Cer and SM during DENV infection [5]. An important observation from the
three systems studied thus far (Ae. aegypti mosquito midgut tissue, Ae. aegypti-derived Aag2
cells and Ae. albopictus-derived C6/36 cells) is that the SP synthetic pathway is significantly
activated during infection, with the Cer concentration being a focal point. In contrast, work by
Aktepe et. al., on mammalian cells showed that DENV replication was enhanced upon the
inhibition of Cer synthesis [86]. Therefore, while a critical focal point during infection, the SP
synthetic pathway requires further investigation to determine how the Cer hub and other
intermediates in the SP metabolic pathway might support or limit infection.
Mitochondrial β-oxidation and metabolite trapping
During mitochondrial β-oxidation activated fatty acids (FA-CoAs) in the cytoplasm are esteri-
fied with carnitine to produce acyl-carnitines that are then shuttled to the mitochondrial
matrix for energy production [87–89]. In this study, we observed a temporal accumulation of
medium-length carbon chain-containing acyl-carnitines in DENV-infected midguts com-
pared to uninfected midguts. The accumulation of medium-length carbon chain acyl-carni-
tines was reported to be indicative of incomplete β-oxidation [90]. Given that DENV
replication requires FA-CoAs, for lipid biosynthesis and subsequent membrane expansion, it
is possible that acyl-carnitine accumulation results from a manipulation of β-oxidation (an
increase or decrease) in order to provide for viral replicative needs [5, 71, 86].
There are two possible hypotheses to explain the accumulation of medium-chain length
acyl-carnitines during DENV infection (Fig 10). In hypothesis I, accumulation of acyl-carni-
tines might be caused by inhibition or blockage of β-oxidation in the mitochondria reducing
the production of ATP (Fig 10I). This phenomenon has been observed in cells exposed to hyp-
oxic conditions [91–93]. Similar effects were observed during DENV infection of human cells;
in infected HepG2 cells, mitochondrial membrane damage appeared to lead to a reduction in
ATP levels [94]. To maintain energy homeostasis, energy consumption is diverted towards
increasing glucose uptake and glycolysis [91]. This response has also been observed in DENV-
infected primary human cells [95]. Due to the stalling of acyl-carnitine transport and a blockage
of β-oxidation, FA-CoA lipid partitioning may occur to divert FA-CoAs towards a synthesis of
complex lipids and membrane expansion at the expense of fatty acid oxidation [92, 95, 96].
Alternatively, in hypothesis II, an accumulation of medium-length carbon chain acyl-carni-
tines could occur because of mitochondrial overload (Fig 10II). In this scenario, due to
increased energetic demands during infection, a large proportion of FA-CoAs enter mitochon-
dria but are only partially broken down by β-oxidation, which serves as a bottle neck for this
reaction. This phenomenon was observed in human skeletal muscle insulin resistance [61].
The ATP that is produced by β-oxidation is sufficient to supply the energetic needs for

 producing more virions, and acetyl-CoA (2 carbon product) can be recycled for de novo syn-
thesis of new longer-chain FA-CoA molecules directly at the site of virus replication [6]. This
hypothesis is supported by Heaton et al. during DENV infection of Huh7.5 human liver cells,
where they observed an increase in autophagosome processing of cellular lipid droplets and
TAGs to produce free fatty acids and a stimulation of mitochondrial β-oxidation [71]. The
molecular mechanisms of how mitochondrial energetics are diverted to benefit DENV replica-
tion in the mosquito midgut are still unclear and the observations in this study present the first
insight into the possibilities.
Metabolic competition versus commensalism
FA-CoAs (activated fatty acids) form a primary hub that integrates multiple lipid metabolic
pathways, some of which were found to be perturbed in this study during DENV infection
(Fig 9). These molecules are key to the synthesis of more complex lipids, which are important
for DENV replication in both human and mosquito cells [4–7]. FA-CoAs are also important
for activating several signaling pathways in the cell [97, 98]. Interestingly, there is evidence
that Wolbachia, the endosymbiotic bacterium used to control DENV infection in Ae. aegypti,
might drive this metabolic balance in the opposite direction (FA-CoA to free fatty acid) sug-
gesting opposing metabolic driving forces resulting in a competition between virus and endo-
symbiont [73]. Recent studies in Wolbachia-infected, Ae. albopictus (Aa23) cells have
supported this hypothesis and indicated that several lipid groups such as SP, PC, and DAG
previously shown to be elevated in DENV-infected C6/36 cells were depleted upon Wolbachia
infection of the cells [5, 23, 24].
The hypothesis that metabolic challenge rather than immune pathways form the basis for
pathogen-blocking capabilities of Wolbachia is further supported by observations by Caragata
et al, 2013 [99] who showed that cholesterol might also be a limiting factor that drives meta-
bolic competition between virus and endosymbiont. Specifically, increasing cholesterol avail-
ability via an enriched diet increases virus replication in the insect and reduces the impact of
Wolbachia-mediated pathogen suppression. Mosquitoes are incapable of de novo synthesis of

observed because β-oxidation in the mitochondria is inhibited or blocked by infection. Hypothesis II represents a
pathway that leads to mitochondrial overload during infection due to increased energetic demands. Abbreviations:

 sterols [16, 100], and must sequester these molecules from the blood meal or from microbiota
that are capable of synthesizing these lipids. In the presence of Wolbachia, it is possible that
cholesterol “stealing” from the vertebrate blood meal may make cholesterol unavailable for
DENV infection/replication. In mammalian systems, it has been shown that cholesterol is crit-
ical for DENV replication [67, 68], and therefore, it is interesting to contemplate what might
happen in the mosquito where these lipids are limited. Alternately, other species of lipids
could substitute for the function(s) of cholesterol during DENV replication in the mosquitoes.
In this study, we detected over hundred cholesterol molecules with one fourth of the molecules
showing alterations during early phases of DENV replication in the midgut. The specific role
these molecules might play in the virus-vector interactions yet remain to be explored.

These in vivo studies are the obvious next step to previous studies that have evaluated meta-
bolic changes induced by DENV infection in cell culture models. Interestingly, in both human
[6] and mosquito cell cultures models [5] we observed a significant increase in GP expression
during DENV infection. We determined that this burst of GP abundance is due to the activity
of FAS that seems to be stimulated and re-localized to sites of viral RNA replication by DENV
nonstructural protein 3 (NS3) [5]. We anticipated that this might also be true in vivo. Accord-
ingly, we saw a significant increase in GPs in Ae. aegypti midguts that directly coincides with
the peak of viral replication (similar to that observed in both human hepatoma and C6/36
cells) indicating that it could be a key modulator of DENV infection. In mosquitoes, in vitro
(C6/36 cells) we did not see significant PG/PI involvement the during infection. However, we
do see activity in mosquito midguts following infection. The concentrations of PG lipids are
reportedly lower in eukaryotic membranes but higher in bacterial membranes, and therefore
could be elevated in the midguts by contributions from the microbiome [101]. However, to
accurately compare the specific GP landscape with respect to true concentrations of head
groups, extensive targeted analyses will need to be carried out in the future. Lysophospholipids
(LysoGPs) also seemed more heavily perturbed in C6/36 cells compared to mosquito midguts
with evidence that phospholipase A2 may have increased activity during DENV infection [5].
A striking observation in this study is that among the GPs that were significantly altered in
abundance during infection, lysoGPs were prominently decreased in abundance in infected
midguts while they were increased in abundance in infected C6/36 cells. These lipids are
known to be stress-related as well as to function as precursors and signaling molecules that
also play important roles in influencing membrane architecture [102, 103]. These different
response patterns in vitro and in vivo indicate a more complex situation in the whole animal
and is evidence that in vitro observations are not always translatable to the in vivo environment.
Sphingolipids (SPs) also showed differences between the cell culture and in vivo systems.
While in C6/36 cells some of the major SPs like SM and Cer were perturbed during infection,
in the midgut tissues, we saw both precursors and downstream products of Cer metabolism as
well as complex SPs being perturbed. Interestingly, while several SMs were detected, we did
not see any significant changes in SM abundance during infection. The observation of SPs in
Aag2 cells was rather uninformative, with only a few Cer and DHCer molecules showing sig-
nificant differences in abundance during infection. However, alteration of the Cer to DHCer
ratio in these cells by RNAi knockdown significantly reduced DENV genome replication and
infectious virus release. These observations suggested that there may be a battle between the
virus and the host to regulate the Cer hub that results in keeping most of the SPs in balance.
Actively changing this hub can significantly impact the viral life cycle. A caveat is that when
comparing metabolic responses of these different in vivo and in vitro models systems to DENV

 infection, it is important to take into account the inherent differences between the systems that
might impact this response. For example, C6/36 cells, are a cell line derived from Ae. albopictus
larvae (a different species to Ae. aegypti), and are defective in the RNAi pathway [104]. The
Aag2 cell line, while derived from Ae. aegypti embryos are persistently infected with cell fusing
agent virus (CFAV) [105]. Our in vivo studies were carried out in adult female Ae. aegypti mid-
gut tissue, representing a much more complex and biologically relevant cellular environment.
Summary
We present the first comprehensive analysis of the metabolome of Ae. aegypti, the primary mos-
quito vector of dengue, Zika, chikungunya and yellow fever viruses, during DENV infection.
Alterations in the metabolome are quantitative indicators of the outcome of arbovirus-host
interactions that facilitate virus replication or may result from host responses to infection. Our
study provides evidence that DENV infection specifically alters the lipid repertoire at the initial
site of viral replication, the midgut of the mosquito. Since this study was carried out using a
highly susceptible mosquito strain with a laboratory-adapted virus, it highlights metabolic path-
ways that may be critical for achieving optimal levels of replication in the midgut required for
successful dissemination and ultimately transmission. Given that vector competence for infec-
tion and transmission is dependent on the specific virus-vector pairing, it will be critical to evalu-
ate the metabolic environment under conditions where the virus has a less robust infection rate
and/or the vector presents infection and transmission barriers. This is particularly important in
field settings where vector competence is also influenced by environmental conditions, co-infect-
ing pathogens and the microbiome of the vector. In addition, there is a growing body of evidence
that metabolic competition between arboviruses and endosymbionts such as Wolbachia may
form the basis of endosymbiont-mediated control of viral transmission. Therefore, exploring
vector metabolism is a powerful and integrative means to identify metabolic control points that
could be exploited to interfere with pathogen transmission or to implement vector control.
Materials and methods
Virus
DENV serotype-2 strain Jamaica 1409 (JAM-1409) was obtained from the Centers for Disease
Controls and Prevention (CDC), Fort Collins, CO, USA [106]. The virus was passaged in C6/
36 cells cultured in L15 medium supplemented with 3% fetal bovine serum (FBS), 50 μg/mL
penicillin-streptomycin, and 2 mM L-glutamine by infecting the cells at a multiplicity of infec-
tion (MOI) of 0.01. Fresh medium was replaced at 7 days post-infection. At 12–14 days post-
infection, virus-containing supernatant and infected cells were harvested to prepare the infec-
tious blood meal.
Mosquito rearing
Ae. aegypti strain Chetumal was originally collected from Yucatan Peninsula, Mexico [107].
Adult mosquitoes were fed on raisins and water, with uninfected blood meals to stimulate
oogenesis, and were maintained at 28˚C, 80% relative humidity with 12–12 h light-dark peri-
ods. Male mosquitoes (20–25 males) were placed in one-pint cartons with 200–250 female
mosquitoes to maintain the colony.
Mosquito infection with DENV
Mosquitoes were orally exposed to a DENV-infectious blood meal using an artificial mem-
brane feeder as described previously [108] but raisins and water were only removed at 24 and

 4 hours prior to blood feeding. For the uninfected control group, we mixed uninfected C6/36
cells suspended in cell culture medium with blood meal to maintain as similar a metabolic
input to the DENV-infected group as possible. Mosquitoes were allowed to feed for 45–60
mins. Blood-engorged mosquitoes were reared up to 11 days and fed on sucrose and water.
Sample preparation for metabolomics analysis
Mosquito dissection.
On days 3, 7 and 11 pbm, midguts were dissected from 200 unin-
fected and 300 DENV-infected mosquitoes. Individual midguts were ground in 100 μl phos-
phate buffered saline (PBS). Two microliters of each individual DENV-exposed midgut
(n = 799) homogenates were collected in a separate tube for qRT-PCR analysis. The rest of the
homogenate was immediately frozen on dry ice and stored at -80˚C for metabolite extraction.
Quantitative RT-PCR detection of infected mosquitoes.
To determine the presence of
DENV RNA in the midgut of mosquitoes following an infectious blood meal, 2μL of midgut
homogenate was heated at 95˚C for 5 mins and chilled on ice prior to performing a one-step
quantitative RT-PCR (qRT-PCR) reaction without RNA extraction. Presence of viral RNA was
quantified using Brilliant III Ultra-Fast SYBR qRT-PCR Master Mix (Aligent Technologies,
CA) and with the primer pairs for DENV2 RNA as described previously [109]. Quantitative
RT-PCR was performed using a iQ5 real-time PCR detection system using the following
cycles: RT at 50˚C, 20 min; 95˚C, 5 min for RT inactivation and 40 cycles of 95˚C, 5 s and
60˚C, 1 min. The results were analyzed with the iQ5 optical system software version 2.0 (Bio-
Rad, CA).
Metabolite extraction.
Two equal pools of 75–100 midgut homogenates for DENV-
infected and mock infected treatment groups were subjected to metabolic extraction. Internal
standards (10 μg Alanine-Leucine-Alanine-Leucine and 10 μg Ceramide d17:1, Avanti, AL)
were added to the pools for normalization of the variation introduced during tissue extraction.
To extract metabolites, one volume of methanol and chloroform and 0.01% butylated hydroxyl
toluene were added to an equal volume of homogenous tissue in PBS [110]. Samples were vor-
texed thoroughly, prior to separation of the aqueous phase from the organic phase by centrifu-
gation at 1,250 x g for 10 minutes. To prevent degradation of metabolites, samples were
processed on ice or at 4˚C throughout the process. Metabolites from aqueous and organic
phases were dried separately by speed-vacuum centrifugation and were stored at -80˚C for fur-
ther metabolomics analysis.
Liquid chromatography—Mass spectrometry (LC-MS) profiling analysis of
metabolites
Two technical replicates of each pool of midguts were analyzed by a LTQ Orbitrap XL instru-
ment (Thermo Scientific, Waltham, MA). It was coupled to an Agilent 1100 series LC (Agilent
Technologies, Santa Clara, CA) equipped with a refrigerated well plate auto sampler and
binary pumping device.
For polar metabolite analysis, reverse phase liquid chromatography was used to analyze the
samples. An Atlantis T3 column (Waters Corp., Milford, MA) with 1.0 x 150 mm, 5.0 μm
dimensions was used for the separation. Solvent A consisted of water + 0.1% formic acid. Sol-
vent B consisted of acetonitrile + 0.1% formic acid. The flow rate was 140 μL/minute. A vol-
ume of 5 μL was loaded onto the column. The gradient was as follows: time 0 minutes, 0% B;
time 1 minutes, 0% B; time 41 minutes, 95% B; time 46 minutes, 95% B; time 50 minutes, 0%
B; time 60 minutes 0% B. The LC-MS analysis was run twice, using positive and negative polar-
ity electrospray ionization (ESI). Data were acquired using data dependent scanning mode.
FTMS resolution of 60,000 with a mass range of 50–1100 was used for full scan analysis and

 the FTMS was used for MS/MS data acquisition with a resolution of 7500 and collision
induced dissociation (CID) mode.
For non-polar metabolite analysis, reverse phase liquid chromatography was also used to
analyze the samples. An Xterra C18 column (Waters Corp., Milford, MA) with 2.1 x 150 mm,
5.0 μm dimensions was used for the separation. Solvent A consisted of water + 10mM ammo-
nium acetate + 0.1% formic acid. Solvent B consisted of acetonitrile/isopropyl alcohol (50/ 50
v/v) + 10mM ammonium acetate + 0.1% formic acid. The flow rate was 300 μL/minute. A vol-
ume of 10 μL was loaded onto the column. The gradient was as follows: time 0 minutes, 35% B;
time 10 minutes, 80% B; time 20 minutes, 100% B; time 32 minutes, 100% B; time 35 minutes,
35% B; time 40 minutes 35% B. The LC-MS analysis was run twice, using positive and negative
polarity in ESI. For MS/MS experiments, data were acquired using a data dependent scanning
mode. FTMS resolution of 60,000 with a mass range of 100–1200 was used for full scan analysis
and the FTMS was used for MS/MS data acquisition with a resolution of 7500 and higher-
energy collisional dissociation (HCD) mode. The top five most intense ions were acquired
with a minimum signal of 500, isolation width of 2, normalized collision energy of 35 eV,
default charge state of 1, activation Q of 0.250, and an activation time of 30.0. The acquired
data were evaluated with Thermo XCalibur software (version 2.1.0).
MS data processing and statistical methods
Raw data were converted to.mzXML in centroid form using msConvert [111]. Downstream
analyses were conducted in the open source R program [112]. The xcms package was used
with the centWave [112–114] algorithm and a Gaussian fit for peak-picking, and the OBI--
Warp method for retention time correction and alignment [115]. Parameters used are given in
the supplement material. Features that had retention times outside of limits determined by the
gradient of solutions used were not included in further analysis (2–33 minutes for nonpolar
modes and 0–47 minutes for polar modes). Intensities for technical replicates were averaged to
provide a single value for each biological replicate and then normalized using median ratio
scaling described by Wang, et al. [116]. One was added to intensity values prior to transforma-
tion to log2 because of the presence of zeroes. Statistical analysis was conducted in the R pack-
age limma [117], which fits linear models to the data using an empirical Bayes approach,
allowing for information across all features to be used to develop inference about individual
features [118]. P-values were based on a moderated t-statistic with a Bayesian adjusted denom-
inator and adjusted for false discovery rate [119]. Each mode (negative / positive + polar / non-
polar) was processed and analyzed separately. Features were designated as significantly
different when the absolute log2 fold change was greater than or equal to one, and the adjusted
p-value was less than 0.05. Where results from all modes are included in one table or graph,
the significance is based on the analysis in single modes alone. Putative molecular names of
features were identified by searching mass per charge ratio (m/z) against the Human Metabo-
lome Database (HMDB), LIPID Metabolites and Pathways Strategy (LIPID MAPS) and
Metabolite and Tandem MS Database (Metlin) [118]. [M+H]+, [M+Na]+ and [M+NH4]+
adducts were accounted for in the neutral mass calculation in the positive ionization mode
nonpolar phase data and [M+H]+, [M+Na]+ for the polar phase data. [M-H]- was the only
adduct accounted for in the calculation of negative ionization mode data. The identifiable mol-
ecules with mass accuracy of <6 ppm error was further classified into metabolic classes. Fea-
tures with MS/MS data were further validated by searching against the NIST MS/MS (2014)
(Agilent Technologies) and LipidBlast (2012) [120] libraries using MS PepSearch (2013) [121]
and manually inspected using NIST MS Search (v2.0) [122].

 Generating long double-stranded RNA for mosquito gene expression
knockdown by RNAi
Long double-stranded RNA (dsRNA) was reversed transcribed and amplified from Ae aegypti
mosquito total RNA. Briefly, total RNA was extracted from a whole mosquito homogenized in
TRIzol reagent (Ambion). Primers were designed to amplify a region of ~ 500 bp of the gene
of interest and a T7 promotor sequence was added to the 5’ end of both forward and reverse
primers (S2 Table). Reverse transcription reaction (RT) and polymerase chain reaction (PCR)
were performed in two-steps using SuperScript III Reverse Transcriptase (Invitrogen) and Taq
polymerase (NEB) respectively. PCR products were purified using the GeneJET PCR Purifica-
tion kit (Thermo Scientific) and subjected to in vitro transcription using the MEGAscript T7
kit (Invitrogen) according to the manufacturer’s protocol. The reactions were incubated at
37˚C for 12 h. The transcribed products were then heated to 75˚C for 5 minutes and cooled
down at room temperature for 4 h to allow dsRNA to anneal. The products were then treated
with DNase to get rid of the DNA template and purified by phenol-chloroform followed by
ethanol precipitation. The purified dsRNAs were stored at -80˚C for future use.
Double stranded RNA knockdown of genes in Aag2 cells
Aedes aegypti (Aag2) cells were cultured in Schneider’s insect medium (Sigma-Aldrich) supple-
mented with 2 mM L-glutamine, 1% non-essential amino acids, and 10% FBS. To perform
dsRNA knockdown in Aag2 cells, the cells were seeded in a 48-well plate at 50,000 cells/well.
Twenty four hours later, the cells were transfected with 260 ng of dsRNA mixed with TransIT-
2020 Reagent (Mirus) following the manufacturer’s protocol. New medium with 2% FBS was
replaced at 6 hours post transfection. Cell viability assays were performed at 2 days post trans-
fection using the CellTiter-Glo Luminescent Cell Viability Assay (Promega).
DENV infection of the RNAi-knockdown cells
Cells were infected with DENV at 48 h post dsRNA transfection. To prepare virus inoculum,
DENV-containing cell culture supernatant was mixed with 1x PBS supplemented with 0.5mM
MgCl2, 1.2mM CaCl2 and 1% FBS to make a final concentration of virus at a MOI of 0.3.
Medium from Aag2 cells was removed and replaced with 0.3 mL of DENV inoculum per well.
The cells were allowed to absorb viruses at room temperature for 1 h. Then, the inoculum was
removed and replaced with fresh Minimum Essential Medium (MEM; Gibco) supplemented
with 1% non-essential amino acids, 2mM L-glutamine and 2% FBS. Quantification of infec-
tious DENV was carried out by plaque assay on BHK cells [6]. Absolute quantification of intra-
cellular DENV genome replication was performed by qRT-PCR as previously described in
‘quantitative RT-PCR detection of infected mosquitoes’ section above. DENV RNA standard
was produced from in vitro transcribed DENV genome as previously described in [123].
Quantifying mosquito gene expression upon dsRNA knockdown
Cells were collected in 200 μl TRIzol reagent at two days post dsRNA transfection. RNA
extraction was performed following the manufacture’s protocol. Total RNA (500 ng) was sub-
jected to RT using random primers (Invitrogen). The cDNA was quantified by quantitative
PCR (qPCR) using PowerUp SYBR Green Master Mix (Applied biosystems). Primer
sequences designed to quantify DEGS and actin (internal control) genes are shown in S3
Table. ΔΔCt method was used for calculating percent gene expression of the target gene com-
pared to the GFP knockdown control.

 4HPR inhibitor studies in Aag2 cells
Aag2 cells pre-treated with 3.75 μM of N-(4-hydroxyphenyl) retinamide (4HPR; Sigma-
Aldrich) dissolved in DMSO or DMSO only as a vehicle control. The final concentration of
DMSO was at 1% in Schneider media supplemented with 2% FBS. At 24 h post treatment, cells
were infected with DENV at MOI of 0.3. Following absorption, cells were overlaid with MEM
containing 2% FBS and fresh 4HPR or DMSO. Virus-containing supernatant was harvested at
24 hpi and titrated by plaque assay. Cell viability assays were performed with 4HPR or DMSO
treatment without DENV infection using the CellTiter-Glo Luminescent Cell Viability Assay
(Promega).
Quantification of SPs in Aag2 cells by multiple reaction monitoring
(MRM)
SPs were extracted from Aag2 cells following the protocol published by [124]. Briefly, cells
were trypsinized and washed twice in PBS. Equal cell numbers between treated and control
samples were collected. Cer/Sph mixture I Internal standard (Avanti Polar Lipids) was pre-
mixed with chloroform at a final concentration of 2 nM. Metabolic extraction was performed
as described. Metabolites were dried using nitrogen gas.
An Agilent 1200 Rapid Resolution liquid chromatography (LC) system coupled to an Agi-
lent 6460 series QQQ mass spectrometer (MS) was used to analyze SPs in each sample accord-
ing to Merrill et al., 2005 with some modifications [124]. A Waters Xbridge C18 2.1mm x
100mm, 3.5 μm column was used for all LC separations (Waters Corp. Milford, MA). The
buffers were (A) methanol/water/formic acid (74/25/1 v/v) + 5mM ammonium formate and
(B) methanol/formic acid (99/1 v/v) + 5mM ammonium formate for all analyses. All extracted,
dried samples were reconstituted in 200 μL of 80/20 buffer A/B just prior to analysis and 10 μL
was injected for each analysis. All data were analyzed with Agilent MassHunter Quantitative
Analysis (Version B.06.00). The detailed analysis of different SPs is shown in supplemental
materials and methods section (S4–S6 Tables).
