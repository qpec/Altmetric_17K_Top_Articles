BACKGROUND
The incidence of human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection remains high 
among women in sub-Saharan Africa. We evaluated the safety and efficacy of ex-
tended use of a vaginal ring containing dapivirine for the prevention of HIV infection 
in 1959 healthy, sexually active women, 18 to 45 years of age, from seven com-
munities in South Africa and Uganda.
METHODS
In this randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, phase 3 trial, we randomly 
assigned participants in a 2:1 ratio to receive vaginal rings containing either 25 mg 
of dapivirine or placebo. Participants inserted the rings themselves every 4 weeks 
for up to 24 months. The primary efficacy end point was the rate of HIV type 1 
(HIV-1) seroconversion.
RESULTS
A total of 77 participants in the dapivirine group underwent HIV-1 seroconversion 
during 1888 person-years of follow-up (4.1 seroconversions per 100 person-years), 
as compared with 56 in the placebo group who underwent HIV-1 seroconversion 
during 917 person-years of follow-up (6.1 seroconversions per 100 person-years). 
The incidence of HIV-1 infection was 31% lower in the dapivirine group than in 
the placebo group (hazard ratio, 0.69; 95% confidence interval [CI], 0.49 to 0.99; 
P 
= 
0.04). There was no significant difference in efficacy of the dapivirine ring 
among women older than 21 years of age (hazard ratio for infection, 0.63; 95% CI, 
0.41 to 0.97) and those 21 years of age or younger (hazard ratio, 0.85; 95% CI, 0.45 
to 1.60; P 
= 
0.43 for treatment-by-age interaction). Among participants with HIV-1 
infection, nonnucleoside reverse-transcriptase inhibitor resistance mutations were 
detected in 14 of 77 participants in the dapivirine group (18.2%) and in 9 of 56 
(16.1%) in the placebo group. Serious adverse events occurred more often in the 
dapivirine group (in 38 participants [2.9%]) than in the placebo group (in 6 [0.9%]). 
However, no clear pattern was identified.
CONCLUSIONS
Among women in sub-Saharan Africa, the dapivirine ring was not associated with 
any safety concerns and was associated with a rate of acquisition of HIV-1 infec-
tion that was lower than the rate with placebo. (Funded by the International Part-
nership for Microbicides; ClinicalTrials.gov number, NCT01539226.)

The new engl and jour nal of medicine
I
n 2014, approximately 36.9 million peo-
ple worldwide were living with human immu-
nodeficiency virus (HIV) infection.1 Rates of 
new HIV infection among adolescent girls and 
young women remain high in Eastern and South-
ern Africa,2 which underscores the need for the 
development of safe and effective tools against 
HIV infection that women initiate themselves.3-5
Self-inserted vaginal rings, which provide a 
sustained release of antiretroviral drugs over time, 
have the potential to offer women a prevention 
option that does not require daily or pericoital 
use.6 The International Partnership for Microbi-
cides (IPM) developed a monthly self-administered 
vaginal ring that contains the nonnucleoside 
reverse-transcriptase inhibitor (NNRTI) dapivir-
ine, which has antiviral activity against HIV 
type 1 (HIV-1).
In the Ring Study, we assessed the safety and 
efficacy of a dapivirine-containing vaginal ring 
(DVR-004), which was replaced every 4 weeks, 
for up to 24 months. Secondary trial objectives 
were to assess the incidence rate of curable 
sexually transmitted infections, adherence to ring 
use, and incidence of pregnancy. HIV-1 drug-
resistance mutations were assessed in women 
who were infected with HIV-1 during the trial.
Methods
Trial Population, Design, and Oversight
This multicenter, randomized, double-blind, 
placebo-controlled, phase 3 trial involved healthy, 
HIV-negative, sexually active women who were 
enrolled at seven research centers in South Africa 
and Uganda (Fig. 1). Participants were assigned, 
in a 2:1 ratio, to receive either the dapivirine 
vaginal ring, which contains 25 mg of dapivirine 
dispersed in a platinum-catalyzed silicone ma-
trix, or a matched placebo ring. Randomization 
was stratified according to research center. The 
dapivirine vaginal rings contained, on average, 
24.4 mg of dapivirine (nonweighted average of 
eight batches [NK513, OB517, OC519, OF528, 
OK537, PA540, PB543, and PK574] used in the 
trial, with a relative standard deviation of ≤1.4%). 
IPM donated the vaginal rings (dapivirine and 
placebo) used in the trial, which were manufac-
tured by QPharma (Sweden). QPharma had no 
other role in the trial. The authors vouch for the 
accuracy and completeness of the data and analy-
ses presented and for the fidelity of the study to 
the protocol, available with the full text of this 
article at NEJM.org.
Participants could be enrolled in the trial if they 
fulfilled all the eligibility criteria (see the proto-
col and Table S1 in the Supplementary Appendix, 
available at NEJM.org). During the subsequent 
visits to the research center every 4 weeks, the 
participant removed the used ring and replaced 
it with a newly dispensed ring. Used rings were 
to be returned to the trial personnel. Counseling 
regarding adherence to ring use was provided.
Clinical and laboratory assessments after en-
rollment were performed according to the proce-
dures described in Tables S2 and S3 in the Sup-
plementary Appendix. Participants who received a 
diagnosis of a curable sexually transmitted infec-
tion (or other genital infection) were treated.
Participants received counseling regarding 
HIV before and after rapid and confirmatory HIV 
testing (HIV-1 testing algorithms are shown in 
Figs. S1 through S5 in the Supplementary Ap-
pendix) and received counseling with regard to 
reduction of the risk of HIV infection and other 
sexually transmitted infections and adherence to 
contraceptive use. Participants were provided with 
nonspermicidal condoms for male partners. 
Women who were confirmed to be pregnant or 
to have HIV infection discontinued the use of 
the investigational product immediately and were 
referred for prenatal support services, medical 
treatment, and social support, as appropriate.
The trial protocol was approved by the ethics 
committees for each site, and all the partici-
pants provided written informed consent before 
trial-related procedures were initiated at screen-
ing and enrollment. The trial was conducted 
according to the International Conference on 
Harmonisation Good Clinical Practice guidelines 
and other applicable local regulatory require-
ments. Safety data and other data collected dur-
ing the trial were monitored by an independent 
data and safety monitoring board approximately 
every 6 months.
Analyses of Plasma Samples and Returned 
Rings
Plasma samples were obtained and the returned 
used rings were collected at all trial visits. HIV-1

reaction (PCR) assay and HIV-1 genotype resis-

Dapivirine Vaginal Ring for HIV Prevention
tance testing were performed on stored plasma 
samples that were obtained from participants 
who underwent seroconversion to HIV-1. All the 
plasma samples that were obtained in the dapi-
virine group were analyzed for dapivirine with 
the use of high-performance liquid chromatog-
raphy–tandem mass spectrometry.7 Residual levels 
of dapivirine were determined in all used active 
rings and in a subgroup of placebo rings with 
the use of high-performance liquid chromatog-
raphy–ultraviolet testing.8
Primary Efficacy and Safety End-Point 
Measures
The primary efficacy end point was the rate of 
HIV-1 seroconversion. All seroconversions were 
reviewed by an independent seroconversion-
monitoring committee, and only HIV-1 serocon-
versions that were confirmed by the committee 
to be infections that occurred after enrollment 
and before the final visit at which the product 
was used (as assessed on the basis of PCR assay 
for HIV RNA on stored samples in reverse se-
quential order) were regarded as trial end points. 
The null hypothesis of the primary efficacy 
analysis was that the rate of HIV-1 seroconver-
sion would not differ between participants as-
signed to receive the dapivirine ring and those 
assigned to receive the placebo ring. The pri-
mary safety end point was the determination of 
all adverse events as measured by self-reports, 
physical examinations, gynecologic assessments 
(including pelvic examination with the use of a 
speculum), laboratory tests, and other indicated 
investigations.
Statistical Analysis
The trial was designed with a planned sample 
of 1650 women. This number was increased to 
1950 participants to mitigate the potential nega-
tive effect of nonadherence to the assigned prod-
uct as observed at one research center (center 3). 
Figure 1. Randomization and Enrollment of the Participants.
Ethics and regulatory approvals for the clinical-trial 
protocol and its amendments were obtained from the 
relevant ethics committees and regulatory authorities 
for the seven research centers in South Africa (centers 
1, 2, 3, 4, 7, and 8) and Uganda (center 6). One partici-
pant in the dapivirine group did not receive the assigned 
intervention because she was menstruating at the time 
of ring administration, so she was not, per protocol, 
permitted to start use of the product; this participant 
was one of the seven who were not included in the modi-
fied intention-to-treat analysis. The modified intention-
to-treat analysis included participants who underwent 
randomization to the dapivirine group or the placebo 
group (in a 2:1 ratio) and were negative for the human 
immunodeficiency virus (HIV) at enrollment.

The new engl and jour nal of medicine
The revised number allowed for a 95% probabil-
ity of detecting an adverse event occurring at a 
rate of 0.3% or higher. Assuming an estimated 
annual incidence of seroconversion in the placebo 
group of 4%, we calculated that this sample size 
would provide the trial with 81% power to detect 
a 50% lower rate of HIV-1 seroconversion in the 
dapivirine group than in the placebo group. The 
formal statistical test that was used to evaluate 
the efficacy of dapivirine was the two-sided log-
rank test, stratified according to research center; 
an adjusted two-sided significance level of 0.0466 
was used to account for an interim efficacy 
analysis performed at the point when approxi-
mately 50% of the expected number of end 
points had been observed.
The primary analysis was performed in the 
modified intention-to-treat population, which 
included the participants with HIV-1 serocon-
version that was confirmed by the independent 
seroconversion-monitoring committee to be a 
trial end point. Three complementary analyses 
of the primary efficacy end point were pre-
specified in the statistical analysis plan (see 
the protocol): an analysis in which data were 
excluded from one research center (center 3) at 
which widespread nonadherence to the product 
was observed; an analysis in which data were 
censored from participants who did not adhere 
to ring use according to a prespecified defini-
tion that was based on missed trial visits, non-
return of used rings, and self-reports that the 
ring was removed from the vagina for 12 hours 
or more; and a time-varying product-adherence 
analysis, in which adherence (defined as a re-
sidual level of ≤23.5 mg of dapivirine in the 
ring and a plasma concentration of ≥95 pg of 
dapivirine per milliliter) was a time-varying co-
variate.
A subgroup analysis that was based on two 
age groups (≤21 years and >21 years) was pre-
specified in the statistical analysis plan. Owing 
to the observation of higher-than-expected num-
bers of HIV-1 end points and based on a recom-
mendation from the independent data and safety 
monitoring board, the final safety and efficacy 
analyses were performed before the planned 
completion of the trial, which was to include a 
fixed 2-year follow-up for each participant. This 
article reports the final results of the Ring Study 
at the data cutoff point of October 16, 2015.
Results
Trial Participants
A total of 1959 participants were enrolled in the 
trial; 1307 participants were randomly assigned 
to the dapivirine group and 652 to the placebo 
group (Fig. 1). At the data cutoff point, 615 par-
ticipants (31.4%) were still in the trial, 761 
(38.8%) had completed the trial, and 583 (29.8%) 
had discontinued early. A total of 61 of 1959 
participants (3.1%) were lost to follow-up. One 
reason for the high rate of early discontinuation 
was a decision by the sponsor, before unblind-
ing, to withdraw all the participants enrolled at 
research center 3 because of the high rates of 
noncompliance with the protocol and nonadher-
ence to the product that were observed among 
enrolled women. This decision was made in con-
sultation with national and local regulatory 
authorities. Other reasons for early discontinua-
tion included HIV-1 seroconversion, withdrawal 
of consent, relocation, and pregnancy.
The two trial groups were well matched with 
respect to demographic characteristics (Table 1). 
The mean age of the participants in the trial was 
26.0 years (range, 18 to 45). Most of the partici-
pants were single (89.2%), and almost all (98.2%) 
reported having a single main sex partner.
Efficacy
HIV-1 Incidence Rate
HIV-1 incidence rates that were based on sero-
conversions (confirmed trial end points) are 
shown in Table 2 and in Figure S6 in the Supple-
mentary Appendix. The overall incidence rate 
was 4.1 seroconversions per 100 person-years in 
the dapivirine group and 6.1 seroconversions per 
100 person-years in the placebo group. The inci-
dence of HIV-1 infection was 31% lower in the 
dapivirine group than in the placebo group (haz-
ard ratio, 0.69, 95% confidence interval [CI], 0.49 
to 0.99; P 
= 
0.04). A Kaplan–Meier plot of the time 
to seroconversion is shown in Figure 2.
Results of the three prespecified complemen-
tary efficacy analyses are presented in Table 2. 
The first complementary analysis, which excluded 
participants from research center 3, showed an 
HIV-1 incidence rate of 3.6 seroconversions per 
100 person-years in the dapivirine group and 
5.4 seroconversions per 100 person-years in the 
placebo group. The rate of HIV-1 infection was

Dapivirine Vaginal Ring for HIV Prevention
30% lower in the dapivirine group than in the 
placebo group (hazard ratio, 0.70; 95% CI, 0.47 
to 1.05; P 
= 
0.08).
In the analysis that censored data from par-
ticipants in each group who had three or more 
events of prespecified nonadherence in 1 year, 
the HIV-1 incidence rate was 3.3 seroconversions 
per 100 person-years in the dapivirine group and 
4.3 seroconversions per 100 person-years in the 
placebo group (hazard ratio, 0.74; 95% CI, 0.49 
to 1.14; P 
= 
0.16) (Table 2). The analysis that was 
based on time-varying product adherence in the 
dapivirine group (defined by a residual level of 
≤23.5 mg of dapivirine in used rings and a 
plasma concentration of ≥95 pg of dapivirine per 
milliliter) showed a 29% lower rate of HIV-1 in-
fection during adherent intervals between visits 
than during nonadherent intervals between vis-
its (hazard ratio, 0.71; 95% CI, 0.42 to 1.22; 
P 
= 
0.21) (Table 2).
Results from a prespecified subgroup analy-
sis that was based on two age groups (≤21 years 
and >21 years) showed an HIV-1 incidence rate 
among participants 21 years of age or younger of 
6.4 seroconversions per 100 person-years in the 
dapivirine group, as compared with 8.2 serocon-
versions per 100 person-years in the placebo 
group (hazard ratio, 0.85; 95% CI, 0.45 to 1.60) 
(Table 2). The HIV-1 incidence rate among par-
ticipants older than 21 years of age was 3.4 se-
roconversions per 100 person-years in the dapi-
virine 
group 
as 
compared 
with 
5.5 
seroconversions 
per 100 person-years in the placebo group (haz-
ard ratio, 0.63; 95% CI, 0.41 to 0.97; P 
= 
0.43 for 
treatment-by-age interaction), indicating no sig-
nificant difference in efficacy of the dapivirine 
ring between the two age groups.
Dapivirine Resistance Mutations among Participants 
with HIV-1 Seroconversion
NNRTI resistance mutations occurred in 14 of 
77 participants (18.2%) with HIV-1 seroconver-
sion in the dapivirine group and in 9 of 56 
(16.1%) with HIV-1 seroconversion in the place-
bo group (Table S4 in the Supplementary Ap-
pendix). The NNRTI mutation E138A was de-
tected more frequently in participants in the 
dapivirine group than in those in the placebo 
group (11.7% vs. 1.8%). Other NNRTI mutations 
occurred with similar or lower frequency in the 
dapivirine group than in the placebo group.
Dapivirine Levels in Returned Rings and Dapivirine 
Plasma Concentrations
Through October 16, 2015, a total of 35,706 
rings were returned of the 36,720 rings that had 
been dispensed (97.2%). A total of 83% of the 
returned used rings contained 23.5 mg or less of

The modified intention-to-treat population included participants who underwent randomization (in a 2:1 ratio) and were negative for the 
 
human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) at enrollment. Data from participants who did not undergo seroconversion to HIV type 1 (HIV-1) 
were censored at the date of the last negative HIV-1 test result. Person-years are based on the cumulative follow-up time (i.e., time to HIV-1 
seroconversion or time to censoring of data at the date of the last negative HIV-1 test result). Hazard ratios and 95% confidence intervals 
were estimated on the basis of a Cox proportional-hazards model stratified according to research center, except as otherwise noted. Efficacy 
was evaluated with the use of a log-rank test, stratified according to research center, with a hazard ratio of 1 for the null hypothesis at a two-
sided significance level of 0.0466 (to account for superiority evaluation at the interim analysis).
†  
P = 0.04.
‡  
We conducted three prespecified complementary analyses of the primary efficacy end point: an analysis that excluded data from one re-
search center (center 3) at which widespread product nonadherence was observed; a product-adherence analysis that censored data of 
 
participants who did not adhere to ring use according to a prespecified definition that was based on missed trial visits, nonreturn of used 
rings, and self-reports that the ring was removed from the vagina for 12 hours or more; and a time-varying product-adherence analysis, in 
which adherence was included as a time-varying covariate.
§  
In this analysis, the definition of adherence (residual level of dapivirine in the ring ≤23.5 mg and plasma concentration of dapivirine ≥95 pg 
per milliliter if both assessments were available; otherwise based on the available assessment) was used to categorize time periods as ad-
herent or nonadherent. Last-observation-carried-forward imputation was used for time points at which no residual levels in the ring or plasma 
concentrations were available and for which sampling was scheduled. The same woman could contribute observation time to both periods. 
The total amount of follow-up time in the adherent periods was 1460 person-years; 50 participants underwent HIV-1 seroconversion during 
these adherent periods. The total follow-up time in nonadherent periods was 424 person-years; 27 participants underwent HIV-1 seroconver-
sion during these nonadherent periods. A total of 3 person-years of follow-up was associated with missing data before a first measurement 
(for which no imputation could be performed).

Hazard ratio and 95% confidence intervals for the subgroup analyses were estimated on the basis of a Cox proportional-hazards model in-
cluding treatment, age, and treatment-by-age interaction, stratified according to research center. Neither the age effect (P = 0.07) nor the 
treatment-by-age interaction (P = 0.43) was significant.

Dapivirine Vaginal Ring for HIV Prevention
dapivirine. The overall median residual level of 
dapivirine in the rings was 21 mg. Dapivirine 
was detected at levels of 95 pg or more per milli-
liter of plasma in 84% of the samples obtained 
every 4 weeks. Overall, the median plasma con-
centration of dapivirine was 264 pg per milliliter. 
At all visits, at least 73% of the participants had 
a residual level of 23.5 mg or less of dapivirine 
in the ring and a plasma concentration of at 
least 95 pg of dapivirine per milliliter (Table S5 
in the Supplementary Appendix).
Safety
Adverse Events
The cumulative incidence of adverse events dur-
ing the trial was similar in the dapivirine group 
(1142 of 1306 participants [87.4%]) and the pla-
cebo group (559 of 652 [85.7%]). A total of 63 
participants (4.8%) in the dapivirine group and 
19 (2.9%) in the placebo group had an adverse 
event of grade 3 or 4 during the trial (Table 3, 
and Table S6 in the Supplementary Appendix). 
The difference between the trial groups was not 
significant, and none of these adverse events 
were assessed by the investigators as being 
product-related. Three deaths (grade 5 events) 
were reported. All other adverse events during 
the trial were of grade 1 or 2 (Table S7 in the 
Supplementary Appendix).
Overall, 44 participants (38 [2.9%] in the 
dapivirine group and 6 [0.9%] in the placebo 
group) had at least one serious adverse event 
(Table 3, and Table S8 in the Supplementary Ap-
pendix). The difference between the groups was 
significant (P 
= 
0.008), but no patterns were 
identified to indicate clinical relevance. The inves-
tigators considered none of the serious adverse 
events to be product-related, and no serious ad-
verse events resulted in the withdrawal of par-
ticipants from the trial. Two participants in the 
dapivirine group died (one from multiple inju-
ries sustained in a motor vehicle accident and 
one from a gunshot wound), and one participant 
in the placebo group died (from circulatory col-
lapse during substance abuse).
Product-related events were reported in five 
participants (0.4%) in the dapivirine group and 
in three (0.5%) in the placebo group (Table 3, 
Figure 2. Time to Seroconversion, on the Basis of Confirmed Trial End Points, in the Modified Intention-to-Treat 
Population.
Shown are data in the analysis window up to the end of the week 104 (last product-use visit). Eight participants in 
the dapivirine group and nine in the placebo group had longer follow-up time, including one participant in the dapi-
virine group and four in the placebo group who had seroconversion at the exit visit. The inset shows the same data 
on an enlarged y axis. HIV-1 denotes human immunodeficiency virus type 1.

All the events that were considered by the inves-
tigators to be product-related were mild in sever-
ity. One participant who was assigned to receive 
the placebo ring discontinued the trial early ow-
ing to grade 2 cervical dysplasia, which required 
further evaluation and treatment.
Safety Laboratory Findings
No relevant differences between the two trial 
groups were observed in the incidence of labora-
tory abnormalities during the trial. Most labora-
tory abnormalities were not clinically relevant 
and were either mild (grade 1) or did not meet 
the criteria for grade 1 (in 1001 participants 
[76.6%] in the dapivirine group and 505 [77.5%] 
in the placebo group).
Sexually Transmitted Infections and Other Genital 
Infections
The overall incidence rates of sexually transmit-
ted infections were similar in the two trial 
groups. We observed 32.0 infections (95% CI, 
29.6 to 34.5) per 100 person-years in the dapivir-
ine group and 31.1 infections (95% CI, 27.7 to 
34.6) per 100 person-years in the placebo group 
(Table S10 in the Supplementary Appendix).
Pregnancy Incidence Rate
The incidence of pregnancy during the trial was 
similar in the two groups. We observed 1.6 preg-
nancies (95% CI, 1.1 to 2.2) per 100 person-years 
in the dapivirine group and 2.0 pregnancies 
(95% CI, 1.2 to 2.9) per 100 person-years in the 
placebo group.
Discussion
In the Ring Study, the insertion of a dapivirine 
vaginal ring every 4 weeks was associated with a 
31% lower risk of HIV-1 acquisition than was a 
placebo ring among women at high risk for HIV 
infection in two countries in sub-Saharan Africa. 
The cumulative probability curves of the inci-
dence of HIV-1 infection indicated that the pre-
vention benefit of the dapivirine vaginal ring was 
achieved early in the trial and was sustained. 
Divergence in the trial groups did not, however, 
increase over time. This result is in contrast to 
that observed in the ASPIRE trial (A Study to 
Prevent Infection with a Ring for Extended Use),10 
a multicenter, randomized, double-blind, placebo-
controlled, phase 3 safety and effectiveness trial 
of a vaginal matrix ring containing dapivirine 
for the prevention of HIV-1 infection in women, 
in which the benefit from the dapivirine vaginal 
ring was apparent only after the first 12 months 
— a finding that was attributed to participants 
needing time to become comfortable with using 
the ring.
Analysis according to age group showed a 
37% lower rate of HIV-1 acquisition with the 
dapivirine ring than with the placebo ring among 
women older than 21 years of age and a 15% 
lower rate among those 21 years of age or 
younger (the age effect was not significant). In 
the ASPIRE trial,10 age was shown to be signifi-
cantly related to protection against HIV-1 infec-
tion, with no protection observed among partici-
pants 18 to 21 years of age and with a 56% lower 
rate observed among participants older than 21 
years of age. The lower level of protection that 
was observed among younger women may be 
due to physiologic differences in the genital tract 
of younger women, lower adherence to ring use,

Dapivirine Vaginal Ring for HIV Prevention
more frequent vaginal or anal sex, or a combina-
tion of these factors. Further analyses of the 
data from our trial may shed light on the reasons 
for the lower rate of protection in this younger 
cohort.
Measurements of dapivirine in monthly plas-
ma samples and in used rings indicate that most 
women in the trial used the ring at some time 
during each month. Although the overall protec-
tive effect that was observed with the dapivirine 
vaginal ring was significant, prespecified ad-
herence analyses that were based on a cutoff of 
23.5 mg or less in the residual level of dapivirine 
in used rings and a concentration of 95 pg or 
more of dapivirine per milliliter of plasma did 
not show increased protection. Previous trials 
investigating HIV prevention have shown rela-
tionships between adherence to the regimen and 
HIV-1 protection,11-13 and a similar outcome was 
anticipated in this trial. However, the prespeci-
fied criteria that were based on plasma concen-
trations and residual levels of dapivirine in the 
used rings may not be the most appropriate 
criteria for assessment of adherence. Both crite-
ria have substantial limitations.
Pharmacokinetic studies have shown that 
plasma levels rise rapidly after insertion of the 
dapivirine vaginal ring, because the initial re-
lease of dapivirine from the ring follows first-
order kinetics. Dapivirine is detectable in plasma 
as early as 1 hour after insertion of the ring, and 
average concentrations exceed 100 pg per milli-
liter within 8 hours.14 Thus, women who may 
have used the ring intermittently or just before a 
clinic visit would have a plasma concentration of 
more than 95 pg of dapivirine per milliliter. In-
deed, the requirement of the trial that women 
remove the used ring at the clinic before insert-
ing a new ring probably contributed to an over-
estimation of adherence in participants.
The prespecified residual level of more than 
23.5 mg of dapivirine in the ring, which was 
based on data from a phase 1–2 study conducted 
in sub-Saharan Africa,15 was used during the 
trial to identify the proportion of participants in 
the dapivirine group who were more than 95% 
likely to be completely nonadherent to the regi-
men. However, the median residual level of dapi-
virine that was observed in the phase 1–2 trial 
and in two phase 1 trials15,16 as well as in the 
Ring Study was 21 mg and is, therefore, proba-
bly a better indicator of sustained adherence to 
ring use. An exploratory time-varying product-
adherence analysis in which adherence was de-
fined as a residual level of 21 mg or less of 
dapivirine in the ring showed a rate of HIV-1 
acquisition that was 44% (95% CI, 7 to 67) 
lower during adherent periods than during non-
adherent periods. Further analyses of the data 
from our trial may assist in determining a more 
appropriate definition of adherence on the basis 
of objective measures.
Mutations that were associated with resistance 
to NNRTIs were generally observed with similar 
frequency in the dapivirine group and the pla-
cebo group, with the exception of the mutation 
E138A, which was observed more frequently in 
the dapivirine group. The E138A substitution is a 
polymorphism of HIV-1 subtype C, and although 
it is associated with rilpivirine and etravirine, two 
close analogues of dapivirine,17 it is not associated 
with nevirapine and efavirenz, which are the 
more widely used NNRTIs in sub-Saharan Africa. 
The data are consistent with the data from the 
ASPIRE trial,10 which also showed no significant 
difference between the dapivirine group and the 
placebo group in the numbers of participants 
with NNRTI mutations suggesting antiviral re-
sistance.
No significant differences in the percentage 
of patients with serious adverse events were seen 
between the dapivirine group and the placebo 
group in the ASPIRE trial. Close monitoring for 
safety in future studies will help clarify these 
findings.
The incidence rate of 6.1 seroconversions per 
100 person-years that we observed in the place-
bo group occurred in the context of a clinical 
trial in which all the participants received regu-
lar HIV testing and counseling, treatment for 
sexually transmitted infections, and free con-
doms. In addition, participants in this trial live 
in communities in which male circumcision by 
medical personnel and HIV treatment are widely 
available.18 Continued high rates of HIV trans-
mission underscore the need for new HIV pre-
vention approaches for women. The protection 
that was observed in this trial among high-risk 
women is lower than that shown with once-daily 
tenofovir or combination tenofovir–emtricitabine 
oral prophylaxis in men who have sex with men19 
and in heterosexual HIV-1–discordant couples.20

The new engl and jour nal of medicine
However, in two clinical trials of tenofovir and 
of tenofovir or tenofovir–emtricitabine oral pro-
phylaxis in participants who are similar to those 
enrolled in our trial, no protection against HIV-1 
infection was observed, because of poor adher-
ence to the daily use of the trial drugs.11,12 Simi-
larly, in studies that evaluated microbicides, one 
study of a vaginal gel containing tenofovir 
showed evidence of protection from HIV-1 infec-
tion,21 but this result was not confirmed in sub-
sequent studies.12,13
The dapivirine vaginal ring was developed to 
provide discreet, self-initiated, monthly use with 
the potential for high adherence. Most partici-
pants were able to use the ring for some time of 
each month, as shown by the residual levels in the 
used rings and by the plasma concentrations. 
Several studies have identified reasons for non-
adherence among female participants in HIV-
prevention trials, including concerns about the 
potential side effects of the product.22-24 Increas-
es in adherence to oral preexposure prophylaxis 
have been shown in open-label studies,25-27 and 
similar trials with the dapivirine vaginal ring are 
ongoing.
