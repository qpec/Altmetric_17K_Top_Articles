SUMMARY
Stem cell treatments for neurodegenerative diseases
are expected to reach clinical trials soon. Most of the
approaches currently under development involve
transplantation of immature progenitors that sub-
sequently undergo phenotypic and functional matu-
ration in vivo, and predicting the long-term graft
outcome already at the progenitor stage remains a
challenge. Here, we took an unbiased approach to
identify predictive markers expressed in dopamine
neuron progenitors that correlate with graft outcome
in an animal model of Parkinson’s disease through
gene expression analysis of >30 batches of grafted
human embryonic stem cell (hESC)-derived pro-
genitors. We found that many of the commonly
used markers did not accurately predict in vivo
subtype-specific maturation. Instead, we identified
a specific set of markers associated with the
caudal midbrain that correlate with high dopami-
nergic yield after transplantation in vivo. Using these
markers, we developed a good manufacturing prac-
tice (GMP) differentiation protocol for highly efficient
and reproducible production of transplantable dopa-
mine progenitors from hESCs.
INTRODUCTION
Stem cell-based therapies for neurological disorders are rapidly
moving toward clinical trials (Steinbeck and Studer, 2015). One
major task en route to the clinic is to generate standardized
GMP-grade human pluripotent stem cell (hPSC)-derived neural
progenitors that will mature and function in the adult brain after
transplantation. Developing meaningful quality control assays
for the functionality of such clinical grade human neural stem
cells poses a major hurdle since the cells are transplanted as
immature progenitors and functional maturation and integration
of the neurons require months in vivo. Therefore, the trans-
planted cells cannot be assessed for proper functionality at the
progenitor stage prior to transplantation. As a surrogate for
markers predicting functional properties, the field has relied on
assessing the transplanted progenitors for expression of genes
and proteins developmentally linked to the generation of specific
neuronal subtypes. However, it is uncertain whether these
markers are predictive of terminal differentiation and functional
maturation, and the progenitors must therefore be taken through
lengthy in vivo functional assessment to control for batch-to-
batch variation and therapeutic efficacy. Identification of novel
markers that can accurately predict the in vivo performance of
stem cell products already at the progenitor stage in vitro would
greatly reduce the number of in vivo studies to be performed dur-
ing the cell development process, and it would also open up the
production of standardized cell products from patient-specific
cells in personalized medicine.
Parkinson’s disease (PD) is a particularly interesting target
for stem cell-based therapies due to the relatively focal degener-
ation of a specific type of mesencephalic dopamine (mesDA)
neuron, and fetal cell transplantation for PD has already been
investigated in several clinical trials (Barker et al., 2015). Recent
developments have resulted in a better understanding of the
developmental and cellular ontogeny of mesDA neurons derived
from the floor plate of the ventral mesencephalon (VM) (reviewed
in Arenas et al., 2015), and this knowledge has materialized
into differentiation protocols giving rise to VM progenitors from
hPSCs that mature and function after transplantation (Doi
et al., 2014; Kirkeby et al., 2012; Kriks et al., 2011, Chen et al.,
2016). In current VM differentiation protocols, mesencephalic
floor plate markers LMX1A, FOXA2, and OTX2 are commonly
used to confirm the mesDA identity of progenitors in vitro
prior to grafting (Doi et al., 2014; Jaeger et al., 2011; Kirkeby
et al., 2012; Kriks et al., 2011). However, a new study has
revealed that these and several other commonly used VM
markers are also co-expressed in diencephalic progenitors of

 the subthalamic nucleus (STN) and therefore do not exclusively
identify the mesDA domain (Kee et al., 2016).
In this study we took an unbiased approach to identify in vitro
markers that can predict successful graft outcome in vivo of VM
progenitors by sequencing more than 30 batches of human em-
bryonic stem cell (hESC)-derived VM patterned cells with known
graft outcomes. We found that expression of LMX1A and FOXA2
is necessary for generation of dopamine (DA) neurons after
transplantation, but the levels of LMX1A, FOXA2, or CORIN did
not correlate positively with the number of DA neurons in the
grafts. Instead, successful in vivo outcome correlated with the
expression of a set of markers enriched in the caudal part of
the VM, highlighting the need for finer control of rostro-caudal
patterning within VM differentiation protocols. To achieve this,
we used timed delivery of FGF8b, which resulted in more precise
control of the rostro-caudal patterning of VM progenitors and
enabled control of differentiation toward either the rostral STN
or caudal mesDA progenitor domains. Furthermore, we applied
the new predictive markers to develop a good manufacturing
practice (GMP) differentiation protocol for highly efficient and
reproducible production of mesDA progenitors from hESCs.
These cells gave rise to DA-rich grafts with extensive host
brain innervation and provided functional recovery in a rat model
of PD.
RESULTS
Common In Vitro mesDA Markers Correlate Poorly with
Dopaminergic Maturation In Vivo
We have over the past 6 years transplanted >500 rats intra-
cerebrally with >30 different batches of hESC-derived mesDA
progenitors (Table S1). In all experiments, cells were differenti-
ated for 16 days (d16) in vitro and transplanted into unilateral
6-OHDA lesioned rats. Although all VM-patterned cell batches
were routinely assessed for high co-expression of the VM
markers LMX1A, FOXA2, and OTX2 prior to grafting (R80%),
we found the in vivo outcome in terms of graft size and number
of DA neurons to vary considerably between experiments (Fig-
ure 1A). To determine the level of batch-to-batch variability in
in vivo DA neuron differentiation in these experiments, we quan-
tified the total number of tyrosine hydroxylase-positive (TH+)
neurons per 100,000 cells grafted (DA yield), graft volume
(mm3), and DA density (TH+/mm3) for all transplants. This
revealed a considerable interexperimental variability (Figures
1B–1D), highlighting a need for new markers that better predict
in vivo DA differentiation and yield after grafting.
We next investigated to what degree commonly used mesDA
progenitor markers in vitro predicted DA yield in grafts after
maturation in vivo by analyzing RNA samples collected from
each individual cell batch, all containing R80% FOXA2/LMX1A
co-expressing cells on the day of transplantation, and also
from the same cells analyzed after maturation in vitro (Figure 1E).
We found that FOXA2, LMX1A, and CORIN gene expression
levels at the time of transplantation did not correlate significantly
with DA yield in the grafts (Figure 1F). This suggests that within
the FOXA2/LMX1A co-expressing progenitor cells, additional
markers are needed to predict in vivo outcome.
Since terminal differentiation and assessment of postmitotic
DA markers are often used to assess DAergic potential of stem
cells in vitro, we investigated whether extended in vitro matura-
tion of the progenitors into neurons for 39–45 days reflected their
corresponding in vivo maturation posttransplantation. In experi-
ments where the cells used for grafting had also been subjected
to parallel terminal differentiation in vitro, we found that expres-
sion levels of DA markers TH, NR4A2 (NURR1), and DDC (AADC)
did not show any statistically significant correlation to the DA
yield after transplantation (Figure 1G).
RNA Sequencing Analysis Reveals that Markers of the
Caudal VM Are Associated with Higher DA Yield in Vivo
To enable an unbiased search for potential markers that posi-
tively correlate with DA yield after transplantation, we performed
global gene expression profiling of cell samples collected at
the day of transplantation, using RNA sequencing (RNA-seq).
Experiments with d16 RNA samples were classified as giving
rise to either high or low DA yield after transplantation (DAhigh
with >3000 and DAlow with <500 TH+ neurons per 100,000
grafted cells, Figure 2A). Unbiased principal component analysis
(PCA), including all selected RNA-seq samples, was performed
to determine whether the DAhigh and DAlow cell batches could
be identified by distinct gene expression profiles (Figure 2B).
We observed a clustering of the DAhigh samples on the positive
PC1 axis, which contained genes such as FGF8, PAX5, EN2,
and CNPY1, all of which have been shown to be important for
midbrain–hindbrain boundary (MHB) formation in the caudal
VM (Figures 2B and S1A; Table S3). As there were clearly distinct
expression profiles between the groups, we next used DESeq2
analysis to identify all differentially expressed genes between
the DAhigh and DAlow samples. Interestingly, among the top
ranked genes in this analysis, we again found a high representa-
tion of genes expressed in the caudal VM and MHB region to be
positively associated with DA yield in vivo, i.e., PAX5, FGF8,
SPRY1, EN1/2, SP5, ETV4/5, CNPY1, TLE4, and WNT1 (Figures
2C, 2D, and S1B; Tables S2 and S3). In contrast, markers of
different stages of neuronal maturation were not differentially
expressed between the DAhigh and DAlow group, indicating that
the distinct graft outcomes between the two groups were not
caused by differences in cell maturity at the time of transplanta-
tion (Figure S1D).
To assess the predictive value of these markers, we next
performed direct Spearman correlation analysis between graft
outcome and the RNA expression levels of selected genes
from the PCA and DESeq2 analyses, comparing these to cor-
relations of meso-diencephalic markers commonly used to
monitor DA differentiation in vitro and in vivo (LMX1A, LMX1B,
FOXA2, FOXP2, CORIN, OTX2) (Arenas et al., 2015; Kirkeby
et al., 2012; Kriks et al., 2011). We correlated the genes toward
graft size, DA yield, and DA density, and to validate the RNA-
seq dataset, we also assessed a subset of gene correlations
by qRT-PCR analysis in the same samples. These analyses
showed that most of the caudal VM markers identified by
DESeq2 (Figures 2C and 2D) indeed showed direct positive
correlation with graft size and DA yield of the grafts (Figures
2E and S1C). A set of key markers, i.e., EN1, SPRY1, WNT1,
ETV5, and CNPY1, also correlated positively with DA density
(Figures 2E and S1C). This was in contrast to the broader and
more widely expressed VM markers FOXA2, LMX1B, CORIN,
FOXP1, and FOXP2, which showed negative correlation to
136
Cell Stem Cell 20, 135–148, January 5, 2017
 both graft size and DA yield (Figure S1C), whereas LMX1A
and OTX2 showed positive correlations only to DA density,
but not to DA yield (Figures 2E and S1C). Other VM markers re-
ported to be involved in mesDA neurogenesis, namely SOX6
and PBX1, did not show any correlations to DA yield or density
of the grafts when analyzed in d16 VM-patterned progenitors
(Figure S1C).
Next, we investigated whether the genes identified formed
part of a co-regulatory network by performing Spearman corre-
lation analysis of the expression values for each candidate gene
toward the others in 29 batches of VM-patterned cells. Through
hierarchical clustering of the Spearman distance between each
gene, we found that all of the MHB genes associated with a
high DA yield showed a pattern of co-regulation (Figure 2F).

 Figure 2. RNA-Seq Analysis of Transplanted VM-Patterned Progenitors Reveals a Positive Correlation between DA Yield and Markers of the
Caudal VM
(A) For unbiased gene expression analysis, graft experiments were divided into DAhigh and DAlow groups based on the total number of TH+ cells in the
grafts. DAergic function of the grafts was assessed in grafts with long-term maturation (>16 weeks) through amphetamine-induced rotation (‘‘�’’, lack of
functional recovery; ‘‘+’’, functional recovery; ND, not determined) or through functional positron emission tomography (PET) imaging (#). Data are presented as
mean ± SEM.

batches were correlated to graft outcome, and the Venn diagram shows positive correlations defined by Spearman correlation analysis with p < 0.05
toward DA yield, DA density, and graft volume. Correlations verified by qRT-PCR are shown in boldface type. See Figure S1 and Table S2 for a complete

 Interestingly, LMX1A and OTX2 showed little or no positive
co-regulation with these genes, and CORIN, LMX1B, FOXA2,
and FOXP2 were negatively correlated with several of the caudal
genes, indicating that these commonly used markers are not
specifically associated with a caudal VM phenotype in hESC-
derived DA progenitors.
To investigate whether the newly identified markers reliably
predicted a high yield of mature DA neurons after transplanta-
tion in vivo, we analyzed a separate set of seven additional
transplantation experiments (not included in the DESeq2
analysis) and correlated the data to qRT-PCR analysis of the
transplanted cell batches. In this independent dataset, we
confirmed that the expression of key markers EN1 and PAX8
correlated positively with DA yield after transplantation (Fig-
ures 2G and 2H), thereby validating our findings from the
DESeq2 analysis. Finally, we also verified that cell preparations
with high expression of the predictive markers gave rise to
grafts containing DA neurons with a mature A9 morphology
(Figure 2I).
VM-Patterned Differentiations and Mature Grafts
Contain Cells of the STN Lineage
We concluded from our RNA-seq analyses that caudal VM
markers correlated positively with high DA yield while expression
of many classical DA neuron progenitor markers did not. Further-
more, we found that several of the most highly enriched genes
in the DAlow group identified by PCA and DESeq2 analysis
(LEFTY1, LEFTY2, ANGPTL4, PTHLH, and NPW) are expressed
in the diencephalon and/or in structures derived from the dien-
cephalon (Figures 2D and S1A; Table S3). A recent study (Kee
et al., 2016) shows that the diencephalic STN neuron lineage de-
velops immediately rostral to mesDA neurons and that the two
are remarkably closely related, with both lineages co-expressing
many genes that until now have been used as mesDA markers,
including Lmx1a, Lmx1b, Foxa1, and Foxa2. Thus, we specu-
lated that markers of the abutting STN domain might be informa-
tive of graft outcome, and RNA-seq expression values indeed
revealed negative correlations between the diencephalic marker
FEZF1 as well as the rostral STN markers EPHA3 and WNT7B
and DA yield in grafts (Figure 3A). This led us to investigate
whether some batches of VM-patterned hESCs contained STN
progenitors derived from the rostral LMX1+/FOXA2+ domain,
which in both mouse and human is characterized by the co-
expression of BARHL1 and PITX2 (Figures 3D and S2A–S2F;
Kee et al., 2016). We detected the presence of both BARHL1+
and PITX2+ cells in our differentiated cell batches on d16. The
BARHL1+ cells could be either FOXA2+ or FOXA2�, and the
PITX2+ cells could be LMX1A/B+ or LMX1A/B� (Figures 3B and
3C), indicating the presence of both ventral diencephalic cells
and lateral mesencephalic populations in our differentiated pro-
genitor batches (Figures 3D and S2A–S2F). We further found the
presence of FOXA2+/BARHL1+/MAP2+ neurons and PITX2+/
LMX1A/B+ cells in our terminally differentiated hESC cultures,
indicating the differentiation of these progenitors into STN
fates (Figures S2G and S2H). In animals grafted with VM-
patterned cells we also detected a variable presence of
BARHL1+ cells (Figures 3E and 3E0), and these cells could
be either PITX2+ indicating ventral diencephalic STN fates or
PITX2� indicating other lateral fates (Figure 3F). To investigate
whether these markers could be used to predict the amount of
non-dopaminergic lateral VM cells, as well as rostro-ventral
contaminating STN cells in our grafts, we quantified the
numbers of BARHL1+ cells in several of our graft experiments.
Although BARHL1/2 as single markers were not predictive of
graft outcome (DA yield/density or graft volume), correlation
analysis showed that the density of BARHL1+ cells in the
grafts indeed correlated with the expression levels of BARHL1
and BARHL2 in vitro in the differentiated cell batches at the
day of transplantation (Figures 3G and 3G0). This implies that
BARHL1 and BARHL2 in progenitor cultures can be used as
markers to quantitatively identify several commonly occurring
rostral diencephalic as well as lateral mesencephalic contam-
inating populations in VM-patterned hESCs both in vitro and
in vivo.
Patterning of VM Progenitors toward a Caudal DA Fate
Can Be Controlled by Time-Dependent Exposure to
FGF8b
Given the variable outcome of VM-patterned hESC progenitors,
we aimed to optimize and fine-tune patterning of our differen-
tiation protocol toward the caudal DA domain of the VM, as
markers of this domain correlated with high DA yield in vivo.
Cells located in the caudal VM are in proximity to the MHB,
and development of mesDA progenitors in this region depends
on the activity of FGF8, a growth factor that is secreted from
the MHB (Joyner et al., 2000). In addition, high expression
of FGF8 was identified to correlate to the DAhigh group in our
unbiased gene expression analyses (Figure 2D). We there-
fore investigated the effect of exogenous FGF8b on cultures
patterned
toward
either
ventral
diencephalic
(CHIR99021
[CHIR] = 0.4 mM) or ventral mesencephalic (CHIR = 0.8 mM)
fates. We found that the addition of FGF8b to the differentia-
tion medium during the early phase of neural induction and
patterning (d0–d9) induced significant upregulation of forebrain
markers FOXG1, SIX3, SIX6, LHX2, and NKX2-1 in dience-
phalic-patterned cultures, whereas hindbrain markers HOXA2
and GBX2 were upregulated in mesencephalic-patterned cul-
tures (Figure 4A). This indicated that early exposure to FGF8b
caused contamination of the cultures with several non-VM
progenitor fates, and this was reflected as more heterogeneous
VM cultures with clusters of NKX2.1+ and PITX2+ progenitors
and patches of LMX1A/B� cells (Figure 4B). In contrast, the
FOXA2+/LMX1A/B+ phenotype of the cells was maintained if
FGF8b was added after the initial patterning toward VM was
completed (from day 7 or 9, Figure 4C). Under these condi-
tions, addition of 100 ng/mL FGF8b caused caudalization of
(G and H) An unrelated set of grafting experiments validated the predictive power of key genes EN1 and PAX8 through direct correlation of mRNA levels measured
by qRT-PCR of EN1 (G) and PAX8 (H) and DA yield in vivo. Results from Spearman correlation analysis are given as R and p values in each graph and correlations
are visualized with linear regression lines.

 the VM progenitors, which we monitored by EN1 mRNA and
protein in cultures treated with FGF8b from d9 to d16 (Figures
4E and 4G). Treatment with FGF8b from d9 to d16 further
caused a significant decrease in the percentage of BARHL1+/
FOXA2+ and PITX2+ STN progenitors (Figures 4D–4F), indi-
cating that late addition of FGF8 to the cultures shifted pro-
genitor fates from anterior VM and STN fates toward caudal
VM mesDA progenitor fates. This caudalization was optimal
at 100 ng/mL FGF8b and increased EN1 expression was main-
tained >20 days after FGF8b removal (Figure S3). While the
addition of FGF8b from d9 to d16 did not affect the percentage
of FOXA2+ progenitors, the number of CORIN+ progenitors was
reduced by 47% (Figures 4H and 4I), in accordance with the
negative correlations found for CORIN in our RNA-seq analyses
(Figures 2C, 2F, and S1C), indicating that CORIN expression is
more strongly associated with a rostral VM and/or diencephalic
fate rather than a caudal mesDA progenitor fate in hESC-
derived progenitors.

 Development of a High-Yield GMP-Adapted
Differentiation Protocol on Laminin-111 Matrix
With a better understanding and control of the DA and STN
differentiation, as well as new progenitor markers predicting
DA yield in mature grafts, we set out to develop a GMP-
compatible differentiation protocol for high and reproducible
yield of caudalized mesDA VM progenitors, using the fully
GMP-derived hESC line RC17. Previous research-grade VM
differentiation protocols have implemented steps of embryoid
body (EB) formation (Kirkeby et al., 2012) or culturing on ma-
trigel (Kriks et al., 2011)—both of which pose problems in
GMP adaptation due to difficulties in reproducibility and the
content of an undefined animal-derived component, respec-
tively. Recently various full-length recombinant laminin iso-
forms suitable for GMP production have been generated and
successfully implemented for derivation and differentiation of
hPSCs (Cameron et al., 2015; Rodin et al., 2014). We tested
seven different laminin isoforms and found that four of them
(Lam-111, Lam-421, Lam-511, and Lam-521) efficiently sup-
ported adherent differentiation of VM progenitors (Figures
S4A and S4B). Whereas Lam-511 and Lam-521 efficiently
support growth of hPSCs (Rodin et al., 2014), we found that
undifferentiated hESCs detached from Lam-111-coated cul-
ture dishes when kept in pluripotency medium (Figure 5A).
Conversely, plating onto Lam-111 in neural differentiation
medium resulted in confluent cultures after 7 days of differen-
tiation, accompanied by a rapid downregulation of pluripo-
tency markers (Figures 5B and S4C). This indicated that
Lam-111 selectively supported the growth of neural cells but
not pluripotent stem cells.
We further found that differentiation in a basal medium of
mixed NeuroBasal + DMEM/F12 with N2 supplement, but
without B27 supplement, from day 0 to day 11 produced the
highest yield of cells on day 11 (Figure S4D), and for full GMP
compatibility, we switched all growth factors and chemicals in
the protocol to clinical grade standard or to the highest grade
available (Table S4). The protocol gave rise to cultures with a
high purity of FOXA2+/LMX1A/B+ progenitors: 90.4% ± 0.9%
(n = 5; Figure 5C), thereby fulfilling our standard criteria for
transplantation (>80% FOXA+/LMX1A+). To ensure accurate
caudalization of the VM progenitors, 100 ng/mL of FGF8b was
included in the protocol from d9 to d16 of differentiation, and
we verified that the cells expressed EN1 while maintaining an
OTX2+/LMX1A+ phenotype (Figure 5D).
The final yield of differentiated progenitors on d16 of this
protocol was >40 times higher than the yield obtained with
the original EB-based research-grade differentiation protocol
(Figure 5E). From this, we extrapolated that we could pro-
duce >3.8 3 108 transplantable progenitor cells in 16 days
when starting from just 1 3 106 undifferentiated hESCs (Fig-
ure 5F). When terminally differentiating these progenitors
in vitro, we verified that the resulting neurons showed functional
properties such as evoked action potentials (n = 11/11) and
received synaptic input (n = 4/5) when assessed by patch-clamp
electrophysiology. In the mature fraction of neurons (resting
membrane potential < �40 mV) four of seven cells further
showed rebound action potentials after brief depolarization,
which is a characteristic of midbrain dopamine neurons in vitro
(Grace and Onn, 1989) (Figures 5G–5J and S4E).
Implementation of Novel GMP Protocol Results in
Reproducible Caudal VM Differentiation with High
Expression of Predictive Markers and Functional
Outcome in Vivo
To monitor critical batch-to-batch variations predictive of in vivo
outcome, we designed a qRT-PCR panel with commonly used
mesDA markers, in which we also included the new key pre-
dictive markers (EN1, SPRY1, PAX8, CNPY1, and ETV5) to
assess for correct rostro-caudal VM patterning, as well as
markers to monitor the presence of any contaminating forebrain
(FOXG1), hindbrain (HOXA2), or lateral (PAX6) cell populations.
The specificity of all primers used was verified in samples of
sub-dissected human fetal tissue (Figure S5).
To assess the reproducibility and accuracy of the new
GMP protocol, we analyzed VM-patterned batches from the
research-grade protocol (n = 31) and GMP protocol (n = 31)
with this qRT-PCR panel. We found that while all batches of cells
had very robust expression of OTX1, OTX2, LMX1A, LMX1B, and
FOXA2, there was considerable variation in the expression of
caudal VM markers PAX8, EN1, SPRY1, and ETV5 between
batches generated with the research-grade protocol (Figure 6A).
The research-grade cell batches generally fell into two cate-
gories: (1) cell batches with high levels of EN1, PAX8, ETV5,
SPRY1, and HOXA2 or (2) cell batches with low levels of EN1,
PAX8, ETV5, SPRY1, and HOXA2, whereas only very few
batches contained high levels of caudal VM markers in the
absence of HOXA2 expression (Figure 6A). These expression
patterns indicated that presence of HOXA2+ hindbrain cells
was necessary for induction of a full caudal VM identity in the
cultures generated by the research-grade protocol. In contrast,
implementation of the new GMP protocol yielded batches of
cells that were more homogenous and did not contain high levels
of HOXA2 contamination. Addition of FGF8b to the GMP proto-
col robustly induced high-level expression of the new predictive
markers (EN1, PAX8, ETV5, and SPRY1) (Figure 6A).
Transplantation of cells from the GMP cell line (RC17) differen-
tiated according to the full GMP protocol resulted in neuron-rich
grafts with a high number of TH+ neurons, clustering predomi-
nantly at the periphery of the graft (Figures 6B and 6D), similar
to grafts of fetal VM-derived DA neurons (Li et al., 2016; Thomp-
son et al., 2005). Quantifications showed that the DA yield
(3,716 ± 1,026 TH+ per 100,000 cells grafted) was similar to
that of the most successful grafts derived from our research-
grade protocol, while the DA density was higher (9,100 ± 1,805
TH+/mm3) and graft size (0.37 ± 0.07 mm3/100,000 cells grafted)
was lower (compared to DAhigh group of Table S1). In line with
their caudal VM patterning, only few cells of the STN phenotype
could be detected (Figure S6A).
Staining for hNCAM and TH showed extensive innervation of
graft-derived TH+ fibers to the dorsolateral striatum and prefron-
tal cortex (Figures 6C–6F00), and similar to reports of fetal grafts, a
minor fraction of the graft-derived fibers extended to the
midbrain (Figures 6C and 6G–6G00) (Isacson and Deacon, 1996;
Kirkeby et al., 2012; Thompson et al., 2009). Many of the graft-
derived TH+ neurons co-expressed GIRK2, and few expressed
CALB (Figures 6H and 6I). Importantly, these grafts also provided
complete functional recovery in the unilateral 6-OHDA rat model
of PD as assessed by recovery of amphetamine-induced rota-
tions and reduction in asymmetric paw use in the cylinder test

 (Figures 6J and 6K). We further replicated the results of the GMP
protocol in a second cell line (H9), where we could confirm that
progenitors high in predictive markers gave rise to DA-rich grafts
expressing GIRK2 and CALB and with the ability to promote
functional recovery (Figures S6B–S6G).
In summary, we were able to optimize our research-grade
differentiation protocol into a reproducible high-yield GMP-
compatible protocol with decreased hindbrain contamination
and increased expression of the caudal VM markers, which we
have identified to be predictive of a good graft outcome.
DISCUSSION
As protocols to form authentic and functional cellular derivatives
from hPSCs become increasingly refined, stem cell-based ther-
apies are rapidly moving closer to clinical trials (Chakradhar,
2016). In this development, the pre-clinical validation of cells
and their in vivo performance is imperative. In some treatment
paradigms, like the newly initiated pluripotent stem cell-based
clinical trials for macular degeneration, fully mature and func-
tional cells are produced in vitro and can therefore be directly as-
sessed prior to use (Kamao et al., 2014; Schwartz et al., 2015).
However, for disorders of the CNS, transplantation is performed
with immature progenitors that undergo terminal differentiation
and maturation after transplantation in vivo. From animal models
of PD, Huntington’s disease, and stroke we know that trans-
planted progenitors mature and become functional only after
several months in vivo (Kirkeby et al., 2012; Ma et al., 2012;
Tornero et al., 2013), and from clinical trials using fetal cells in
patients with PD, functional maturation of the graft has been
observed to continue for several years after transplantation (Ke-
falopoulou et al., 2014). This complicates the assessment of the
therapeutic potential of the cells prior to grafting, as the ability of
stem cell-derived mesDA progenitors to terminally differentiate,
mature, and significantly restore function in animal models of
PD can only be determined in long-term animal studies (Grealish
et al., 2014; Kriks et al., 2011).
A number of studies show that TH is aberrantly expressed by
many cell types in vitro (Daadi and Weiss, 1999; Sonntag et al.,
2004) and reports from older protocols show that cultures with
good TH expression in vitro give rise to surprisingly few DA neu-
rons in vivo (Barker et al., 2015; Kriks et al., 2011). We also
observe aberrant TH expression in non-VM cultures and a high
number of TH+/FOXA2� cells in vitro (not shown), and in line
with this we found that in vitro differentiation into TH+ neurons
does not correlate with the formation of TH+ neurons in vivo.
We also found that although FOXA2, LMX1A, and CORIN are
commonly used to identify mesDA progenitors during develop-
ment (Arenas et al., 2015) and in stem cell cultures (Doi et al.,
2014; Kirkeby et al., 2012; Kriks et al., 2011), they are not suffi-
cient to predict yield or functionality of the cells in vivo. This high-
lights the need to validate markers that can predict functional
maturation of hPSCs in vivo, rather than relying solely on markers
expressed in differentiating progenitors of a specific cell lineage.
When applying an unbiased approach to identifying predictive
markers of successful graft outcome, we found that markers
expressed by midbrain cells close to the MHB (i.e., EN1, ETV5,
CNPY1, PAX8, and SPRY1) correlated with a successful graft
outcome whereas markers expressed in the diencephalic
domain, such as EPHA3, FEZF1, and WNT7B, were negatively
correlated with graft outcome. These findings are in line with a
recent study in the mouse showing a remarkably close relation-
ship between mesDA and STN neuronal lineages (Kee et al.,
2016), where many key transcription factors, including Lmx1a,
Lmx1b, Foxa1, Foxa2, Foxp1, Foxp2, Msx1, Nurr1, and Pbx1,
are shared by both lineages. However, only the mesDA lineage
is identified by expression of En1 and Cnpy1, which are
restricted to the caudal part of the VM (Veenvliet et al., 2013).
Based on analyzing these markers we confirmed that our VM-
patterned cultures contained both STN and mesDA progenitors
and that their relative proportion in each batch likely contributed
to the observed, but previously unexplained, variation in in vivo
outcome when progenitors defined only by high co-expression
of LMX1A, FOXA2, and OTX2 were transplanted. This prompted
us to fine-tune the patterning to enrich for DA progenitors, which
was achieved via timed, exogenous delivery of FGF8b at the pro-
genitor stage of differentiation—a caudalizing agent that has also
previously been applied in vitro (Perrier et al., 2004; Xi et al.,
2012; Chen et al., 2016). This, as well as a number of additional
adjustments, allowed us to generate a full GMP differentiation
protocol for the production of mesDA progenitors. Key to this
GMP protocol is the use of Lam-111, a physiologically relevant
extracellular matrix component that is normally expressed in
the developing brain and that we found to support attachment
of differentiating neural progenitors but not pluripotent stem
cells.
Postmortem brain analyses of patients with PD transplanted
with human fetal VM tissue indicate that grafts containing

 approximately 50–100,000 TH+ neurons with substantial inner-
vation of the host putamen can give long-term symptomatic re-
lief in patients (Hauser et al., 1999; Li et al., 2016; Mendez et al.,
2005). Using the laminin-based GMP protocol, the number of
mesDA progenitors obtained per hESC at start of differentiation
was greatly increased compared to our research-grade protocol,
and the cells resulted in graft outcomes matching our best differ-
entiations from the research-grade protocol in terms of yield,
innervation, and function (Grealish et al., 2014, 2015; Kirkeby
et al., 2012). Given that we get an average yield of approximately
5,000 mature DA neurons per 100,000 transplanted progenitors
from cell batches high in the predictive markers, manual produc-
tion of cells for several hundred patients will be achievable even
in small GMP laboratories without the need for automated cul-
ture systems. The protocol presented here therefore omits
many of the large-scale production issues associated with other
stem cell therapies going into the clinic (Chong et al., 2014). We
observed in our study that a caudalized VM phenotype corre-
lated not only with increased DA yield, but also with increased
graft volume and DA density per 100,000 grafted cells. The
appropriate cell dose to use in patients will be guided by these
outcome parameters when evaluating the clinical cell product
in pre-clinical transplantation studies.
In summary, global gene profiling of a large number of cell
batches that have been transplanted into a rat model of PD,
along with a refined understanding of the close relationship be-
tween DA and STN lineages during development (Kee et al.,
2016), allowed us to establish a panel of markers to more pre-
cisely predict a successful graft outcome already at the progen-
itor stage in vitro. Although stringent in vivo assessment of safety
and potency of stem cell-derived neural progenitors is still
essential before use in patients, the ability to better predict graft
outcome will accelerate the progression of stem cells toward
clinical use as it allows for better in vitro screenings during
cell production. Additionally, it can be used for batch-to-batch
comparability and also to compare the cells grafted in different
clinical trials. In the long term, a better prediction of in vivo
maturation and functional properties of the cells already at the
progenitor level will facilitate the use of autologous or individually
matched cells for transplantation.
EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURES
hESC Culturing and Differentiation
H9 (WiCell) and RC17 (Roslin Cells, hPSC reg #RCe021-A) were used in this
study. All grafts in Table S1 (i.e., Figures 1, 2, and 3) were derived from H9 cells
differentiated toward VM progenitors according to Kirkeby et al. (2012) with mi-
nor modifications only. All grafted cell batches contained >80% FOXA2+/
OTX2+/LMX1A/B+ progenitors as assessed by immunocytochemistry. Grafts
in Table S1 were from H9 cells. In vitro studies in Figures 3, 4, and 6 include
data from both H9 and RC17 cell lines, whereas GMP adaptation (Figures 5
and 6) was performed on RC17 cells. Pluripotent cells were maintained either
on mouse embryonic feeder cells in 20% KSR or on Lam-521 in iPS Brew and
passaged with EDTA once weekly. For details on research-grade EB protocol,
see Kirkeby et al. (2012). For details on GMP Lam-111-based protocol, see
Figure 5 and Supplemental Experimental Procedures.
Animals, Surgical Procedures, and Behavioral Testing
Adult female Sprague Dawley, Lister-hooded (Charles River) or athymic
Hsd:RH-Foxn1rnu rats (Harlan Laboratories) were used as graft recipients. An-
imals were maintained on a 14:10-hr or 12:12-hr light:dark cycle with ad libitum
access to food and water. All rats received a 6-hydroxydopamine lesion of the
medial forebrain bundle and at 3–4 weeks post-lesion underwent amphet-
amine-induced rotations to assess extent of the lesion. Differentiated hESCs
were dissociated and transplanted as previously described (Kirkeby et al.,
2012); for details see Table S1. For surgical procedures, see Supplemental
Experimental Procedures. Behavioral tests were performed as in Kirkeby
et al. (2012) (for details, see Supplemental Experimental Procedures). All pro-
cedures were conducted in accordance with the European Union Directive
(2010/63/EU) and were approved by the ethical and national committees for
the use of laboratory animals at each site (Lund University, Sweden; Cardiff
University, UK; and MIRCen, France).
RNA-Seq Analysis and Bioinformatics
RNA concentration and integrity were assessed on an Agilent RNA 6000
Pico chip, using the Agilent 2100 BioAnalyzer (Agilent Technologies). RNA
(1 ng) was used to produce the cDNA library with Smart-Seq2 protocol (Picelli
et al., 2013). The cDNA libraries were analyzed on high-sensitivity DNA chips
with the Agilent 2100 BioAnalyzer. The cDNA (500 pg) was tagmented with
the Nextera XT DNA sample preparation kit (Illumina) and sequenced on an
Illumina HiSeq 2000 system. Bioinformatics analysis of the raw sequencing
data included alignment of sequence reads to the reference human genome
(hg19) and post-processing using alignment tools STAR and SAMtools. PCA
was used to analyze how individual samples relate to each other based on
overall gene expression profiles. The DESeq2 package without Cook’s cutoff
and independent filtering (Love et al., 2014) determined the differentially
expressed genes between sets of samples (Table S2).
qRT-PCR
qRT-PCR was performed using Sybr Green detection with the LightCycler 480
instrument (Roche). See Supplemental Experimental Procedures for primer
sequences and details.
Immunochemical Analysis and Graft Quantifications
Cells and brains were fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde prior to staining. A com-
plete list of antibodies and dilutions is provided in Supplemental Experimental
Procedures. The number of DAB-stained TH+ neurons was counted manually
at a bright-field microscope under 203 magnification for every section. Final
counts were corrected for series number (1:8 or 1:12) to get an estimate of
the total number of TH+ cells per animal. DA yield is presented as number of
TH+ cells per 100,000 transplanted cells. Graft volumes were quantified
based on DAB-stained HuNu+ cell areas in grafted sections. See Supplemental
Experimental Procedures for further details.
Electrophysiology
Patch-clamp electrophysiology was performed on hESCs differentiated to a
VM fate at day 45 post-differentiation. See Supplemental Experimental Pro-
cedures for detailed methods.
Statistical Analysis
All statistical methods are explained in the figure legends, with a significance
level of alpha = 0.05. Unless stated otherwise, values are shown as mean ±
SEM and asterisks in figures denote significance from Student’s t test between
two groups. For rotational and cylinder behavioral analysis, one-way ANOVA
with Bonferroni correction and paired-sampled Student’s t test were used,
respectively. For all figures, *p < 0.05, **p < 0.01, ***p < 0.001, ns = non-
significant.
