AIM
There is emerging concern that antipsychotics may be associated with an increased risk of myocardial infarction (MI). A previous
review identified five observational studies that did not provide an accurate estimate of the association between antipsychotic
drug use and MI risk. More recent studies have produced variable results.
METHODS
We performed a systematic review and meta-analysis of observational studies to determine whether antipsychotic use affects the risk for
MI. Our analysis included all observational studies that compared MI incidence among patients receiving antipsychotics vs. no treatment.
RESULTS
Nine observational studies were included in the analysis. The odds for developing MI were 1.88-fold higher (odds ratio (OR) 1.88,
95% confidence interval (CI) 1.39, 2.54) in antipsychotic users compared with individuals who had not taken antipsychotics.
Subgroup analyses found an OR of 2.48 (95% CI 1.66, 3.69) among patients with schizophrenia and an OR of 2.64 (95% CI 2.48,
2.81) among short term (<30 days) antipsychotic users.
CONCLUSION
The findings of this meta-analysis support an increased risk of MI in antipsychotic drug users. The present systematic review ex-
pands previous knowledge by demonstrating an increased and more pronounced risk in short term users.
Introduction
Antipsychotic drugs are commonly prescribed for the treat-
ment of schizophrenia, bipolar disorder, acute mania, depres-
sion, behavioural and psychological symptoms of dementia
and delirium [1–5]. The safety of these drugs has been
questioned. Several different types of adverse events have
been associated with antipsychotics such as tardive dyskine-
sia, neuroleptic malignant syndrome, pneumonia, diabetes
and more [6–9].

 Cardiovascular adverse events associated with the use of
antipsychotics are well documented [10]. However, it remains
controversial whether antipsychotic therapy is associated
with an increased risk of myocardial infarction (MI). A num-
ber of epidemiologic cohort and case–control studies have in-
vestigated
this
possible
association.
The
most
recent
systematic review [11] identified five observational studies
that provided variable results. One study [12] with a large
sample size reported no increased risk of MI in antipsychotic
users, whereas four studies [13–16] with small events did. The
inconsistent conclusions may be attributed to heterogeneity
of these studies (sample size, exposure time, type of antipsy-
chotics and so on). The data included by previous systematic
reviews were limited to studies conducted before 2006. Many
studies [17–20] have been published since, which allow for a
more detailed analysis of the association between antipsy-
chotic use and MI risk.
Given the high prevalence of antipsychotic use world-
wide, it is important to determine whether there is a relation-
ship between antipsychotics and the risk of MI. Therefore,
the aim of this study was to conduct a systematic review
and meta-analysis of all observational studies to estimate MI
risk with antipsychotic medication use in adults.
Methods
Data sources and searches
We followed the guidelines published by the Meta-analysis of
Observational Studies in Epidemiology (MOOSE) group [21]
to complete the meta-analysis. We conducted a comprehen-
sive literature search of the Cochrane Library, PubMed and
Embase databases up to July 2015, using the following terms
‘antipsychotic agents’, ‘antipsychotic drugs’ and ‘antipsy-
chotics’ AND ‘acute coronary syndrome’ and ‘myocardial in-
farction’. In addition, reference lists of the retrieved articles
were hand-searched for further relevant articles.
Study selection
Abstracts were considered eligible for full manuscript data ex-
traction if they fulfilled the following criteria: (1) a case–
control or case–crossover or self-controlled case series (SCCS)
or cohort study, (2) antipsychotics were compared with non-
antipsychotics, (3) measurement of MI was a primary or
secondary outcome and (4) risk estimates with confidence
intervals (CIs) or sufficient information to calculate these
values were included.
Data extraction and quality assessment
All data were extracted independently by two authors using
predesigned electronic data extraction and a third author re-
solved any discrepancies before the final analysis. Raw data,
unadjusted odds ratios (OR) or relative risks (RR) with 95%
CIs and adjusted OR or RR with 95% CIs were recorded when
possible. If a study reported more than one measure of MI,
each measure was extracted separately (Table S1). The most
adjusted estimate was included when a study reported more
than one risk estimate. Two authors assessed the quality of
the included studies based on the Newcastle-Ottawa Scale
(NOS), as recommended by the Cochrane Collaboration [22]
(Table S2 and S3).
Outcomes assessed
The primary analysis focused on assessing the risk of MI
among users of antipsychotics. We performed a post hoc sen-
sitivity analysis by eliminating one study from the same data-
base. We also ran a sensitivity analysis by including one
estimate of study involved two study designs one at a time.
In an attempt to explain possible heterogeneity between
studies, we performed subgroup analyses based on study de-
sign (case–control, cohort, SCCS or case–crossover), type of
antipsychotic (typical or atypical), diagnostic categories
(schizophrenia, dementia or mood disorders) and exposure
duration (30, 60 or 90 days). If one study involved two study
designs, the estimates were respectively pooled in the sub-
group analysis based on study design.
Data synthesis and analysis
STATA 10.0 software (StataCorp LP, College Station, TX,
USA) was utilized for all statistical analyses. The Cochran
Q chi-square test and the I2 statistic were used to assess
heterogeneity among studies [23]. I2 values of > 50% or
P values of < 0.05 for the Q-statistic were taken to indicate
significant heterogeneity. Random effects models were used
to
analyze
pooled
effects
when
statistic
heterogeneity
existed. Otherwise, fixed effects models were used. The
association between antipsychotic use and MI risk was esti-
mated using ORs and corresponding 95% CIs generated
from comparisons between cases and controls. Since the
outcomes were relatively uncommon, ORs were considered
approximations
of
RR.
Publication
bias
of
the
studies
included in the final analysis was analyzed using the Begg
funnel plot and the Egger test [24].

 eligible articles were identified. Of these, 1335 articles were
excluded after reading the titles and abstracts and the remain-
ing 93 articles underwent detailed full text evaluation. Nine
observational studies [12–20] were eligible for inclusion and
were assessed for quality. The number of studies that were ex-
cluded from the review and meta-analysis are shown in
Figure 1.
Characteristics of included studies
The main characteristics of the studies included are shown in
Table 1. The earliest study [13] began in 1992 and the most re-
cent of the included studies [20] ended in 2015. Of the in-
cluded studies, three [12–14] were case–control studies, two
[15, 16] cohort studies and two [18, 20] case–crossover stud-
ies. One [17] study used SCCS and cohort study design and
the remaining one [19] used SCCS and case–control study de-
sign. Seven [12, 15–20] of the studies identified patients from
databases, while two [13, 14] used medical records or inter-
view data. In terms of diagnostic categories, one study [17]
evaluated patients with dementia only, four [16, 18–20] eval-
uated patients with schizophrenia, mood disorder or demen-
tia and the others [12–15] included patients with any
diagnosis.
On the basis of the methodologic quality assessment
scores, six studies were of high quality and three were of low
quality. The breakdown of each score is given in Table S2
and S3.
Main results
Upon meta-analysis of all included studies, the use of anti-
psychotics significantly increased the risk of MI (OR 1.88,
95% CI 1.39, 2.54, P < 0.001). There was, however, consid-
erable
heterogeneity
observed
across
studies
(I2
98%,
P < 0.001) (Figure 2). The sensitivity analysis showed no sub-
stantial change in pooled risk estimates upon exclusion of
any single study from the same database or inclusion of one
estimate from one study involved two study designs.
Subgroup meta-analyses
Table 2 presents the results of subgroup analyses. When stud-
ies were grouped by study design, significant associations
were observed in case–control studies (OR 1.20, 95% CI
1.03, 1.40), SCCS studies (OR 1.62, 95% CI 1.34, 1.95), and
case–crossover studies (OR 2.51, 95% CI 2.36, 2.67). Al-
though this association was not significantly found (OR
2.42, 95% CI 0.89, 6.60), there was a trend toward an increase
in MI risk in cohort studies.
In a subgroup analysis by type of antipsychotics, a signif-
icant association was observed among those using typical
(OR 2.19, 95% CI 1.46, 3.28) or atypical (OR 1.72, 95% CI
0.96, 3.07) antipsychotic drugs. Only a few studies provided
data on individual drugs. In one study, a significantly higher
risk of MI was observed with amisulpride (OR 5.65, 95C I%
2.97, 10.76). Two studies found that antipsychotic drug use
was associated with a dose-dependent increase in MI risk,
but one study did not.
Grouping the studies by diagnostic categories revealed a
significantly higher risk of MI among patients with schizo-
phrenia (OR 2.48, 95% CI 1.66, 3.69) or dementia (OR 1.82,
95% CI 1.16, 2.84). However, no significant associations were

 observed among patients with mood disorders (OR 1.66, 95%
CI 0.86, 3.22).
When we grouped studies by exposure duration, the asso-
ciation between antipsychotic use and MI risk weakened over
time, with ORs decreasing from 2.64 (95% CI 2.48, 2.81) to
1.59 (95% CI 1.17, 2.18) to 1.35 (95% CI 1.09, 1.67) from 30
to 60 to 90 days, respectively.
Publication bias
Although we observed no statistical evidence of publica-
tion bias (Begg’s test, P = 0.33; Egger’s test, P for bias = 0.74)
(Figure 3), it should be noted that the funnel plot showed
the distribution was deviated. The funnel plot revealed an
apparent asymmetry that suggested the presence of a poten-
tial publication bias, a language bias, inflated estimates by a
flawed methodologic design in smaller studies and/or a lack
of publication of small trials with opposite results.
Discussion
This meta-analysis of current observational evidence suggests
that antipsychotic medications are associated with a modest
increase in the risk of MI. Most of the results of the subgroup
analyses were consistent with the overall results. A more pro-
nounced risk of MI was found among patients with schizo-
phrenia or in patients with antipsychotic drug use within a
30 day period. As considerable heterogeneity was observed
in the marked study, we can be less certain about this result.
Several explanations for the increased risk of MI with the
use of antipsychotics are hypothesized, but the underlying
mechanisms remain speculative. It is suggested that weight
gain and metabolic syndrome induced by antipsychotic use
could be risk factors for MI [25]. If such factors are involved,
the risk would be expected to increase progressively with an-
tipsychotic drug use duration. However, our analysis showed
an acute decrease in MI risk after 30 days of use. A second
plausible explanation refers to the finding that, in one study,
Figure 2

628

 a highest increased risk for MI has been observed with anti-
psychotics having a high affinity for the D3 receptor
(amisulpride). Preclinical studies [26–28] demonstrated that
aberrant D3 receptor expression in the heart and peripheral
vascular system may increase intimal permeability, vascular
remodelling and atherosclerosis formation. Additionally, a
recent meta-analysis [29] found a link between the use of
antipsychotics and venous thromboembolism, suggesting
that D3 receptor systems may be involved in platelet aggrega-
tion and the secretion of procoagulant factors [30, 31].
Hence, antipsychotic use could predispose patients to the for-
mation of acute thrombosis in stenotic coronary arteries,
contributing to MI. Finally, antipsychotic medicines have
been shown to activate 5-HT2A receptors at sites of coronary
atherosclerosis [32], leading to thrombus formation and vas-
cular contraction. Such an effect might play a role in the
pathogenesis of MI.
Although the modifying effects of antipsychotics on MI
are biologically plausible, the included studies have reported
conflicting results, as reflected in the significant heterogene-
ity in our meta-analysis. This heterogeneity could not be
explained by study design and quality. The existence of clini-
cal heterogeneity would be expected to lead to some degree of
statistical heterogeneity in the results. The inconsistent con-
clusions may be owing to differences in enrolment criteria
and exposure definition. First, most of included patients were
diagnosed with dementia, schizophrenia or affective disor-
ders and these patients were at different risks of cardiovascu-
lar
diseases.
To
minimize
the
heterogeneity,
subgroup
analyses based on diagnostic categories found different risks
of MI among these patients. A highest risk seen in patients
with schizophrenia may be explained by more use of co-
medication and a worse underlying health state [33, 34]. Fur-
thermore, lifestyle factors such as alcoholism and smoking
are also associated with a higher risk of MI [35]. However, an-
tipsychotic use was found to increase, but not significantly,
the risk of MI in patients with affective disorders. This might
be explained by direct cardioprotective effects of mood stabi-
lizers which have been suggested in other research [36].
Second, the different degree of receptor binding affinity
by antipsychotic medicines may have been a potential source
of heterogeneity. Most of the included studies explored the
effects of typical and atypical antipsychotics as a whole, and
a similar risk of MI was found between them. However, only

 one study [18] provided varied risk data of individual drugs,
finding the highest MI risk in amisulpride users. Besides, it
is of paramount relevance to understand if there are dose-
dependent effects. It should be acknowledged that these
concerns are not addressable by means of meta-analyses of
aggregate data and, therefore, only tentative suggestions can
be made. Three studies [12, 18, 20] evaluated the effect of
dosage on the MI risk. Two studies [18, 20] found a positive
association, while one [12] found no association. Hence, our
results of individual or dosage of antipsychotic drugs on risk
of MI may be limited by sample size and need further investi-
gation to clarify this issue.
Third, definition of antipsychotic exposure was incon-
sistent across the included studies. In our subgroup analy-
sis based on exposure time, there was 0% heterogeneity
among studies. Our results expand on previous knowledge
by demonstrating a substantial MI risk in short term users,
thus suggesting an acute effect of antipsychotics. This
finding is further reinforced by a relatively lower but
significant risk observed in longer term users. Such lower
risk observed in more long term antipsychotic users might
be related to the effects of tolerance and cross-tolerance to
antipsychotic drugs.
Although antipsychotic use is associated with a modestly
increased risk of MI, the population impact of antipsychotic-
associated MI is likely to be substantial because of the large
number of users. Clinicians should ensure that antipsy-
chotics are prescribed only for patients with a clear indication
and be cautious when prescribing antipsychotics to patients
who have an underlying increased MI risk. As antipsychotics
are an effective intervention for some major psychiatric
conditions, the relatively modest increased absolute risk of
MI is unlikely to alter their benefit–risk balance when used
appropriately. Nonetheless, all patients prescribed these
medications should be monitored during the course of
antipsychotic treatment if MI-related signs and symptoms
are identified, considering the possibility of treatment
withdrawal.
This systematic review and meta-analysis was limited by
the inclusion of only observational studies, which are
susceptible to confounding. Unfortunately, there have been
no randomized controlled trials that evaluated the risk of
MI with antipsychotic use. Such studies are usually under-
powered to detect rare events. Second, there was evidence of
heterogeneity for the association between antipsychotic use
and MI risk. Thus, subgroup analyses were performed to ex-
amine the source of the heterogeneity, but the variables eval-
uated did not thoroughly explain the source of heterogeneity.
When the exposure time period was taken into account, there
was 0% heterogeneity among studies, suggesting that anti-
psychotic use has a time-dependent effect on MI risk.
Different individual antipsychotic drugs may also have been
a source of heterogeneity and this issue merits further explo-
ration. Third, all included studies focused on adult patients.
Given that there is an elevation in antipsychotic use among
children and youth [37], more data about cardiovascular
safety are needed in this population. Fourth, the Begg’s test
is known to lack power, reducing our ability to detect poten-
tial publication bias. Finally, we could not extract enough
data to run a subgroup analysis based on concurrent drug
use. Antidepressants are commonly prescribed concurrently
with antipsychotics for treatment of diverse psychiatric
disorders. These drugs are considered to be associated with
an increased risk of cardiovascular events [38]. Future
studies should also investigate the risk of MI when antipsy-
chotic medications are used together with these drugs.
Conclusion
In summary, the present meta-analysis suggests that antipsy-
chotic use is significantly associated with MI risk, especially
among patients with schizophrenia or with drug use during
the first 30 days. Clinicians should ensure that antipsychotics
are prescribed only for patients with clear indications.
