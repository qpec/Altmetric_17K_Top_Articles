Context: A growing body of evidence suggests that endocrine-disrupting chemicals (EDCs) con-
tribute to female reproductive disorders.
Objective: To calculate the associated combined health care and economic costs attributable to
specific EDC exposures within the European Union (EU).
Design: An expert panel evaluated evidence for probability of causation using the Intergovern-
mental Panel on Climate Change weight-of-evidence characterization. Exposure-response rela-
tionships and reference levels were evaluated, and biomarker data were organized from carefully
identified studies from the peer-reviewed literature to represent European exposure and approx-
imate burden of disease as it occurred in 2010. Cost-of-illness estimation used multiple peer-
reviewed sources.
Setting, Patients and Participants and Intervention: Cost estimation was carried out from a societal
perspective, ie, including direct costs (eg, treatment costs) and indirect costs such as productivity
loss.
Results: The most robust EDC-related data for female reproductive disorders exist for 1) diphe-
nyldichloroethene-attributable fibroids and 2) phthalate-attributable endometriosis in Europe. In
both cases, the strength of epidemiological evidence was rated as low and the toxicological evi-
dence as moderate, with an assigned probability of causation of 20%–39%. Across the EU, attrib-
utable cases were estimated to be 56 700 and 145 000 women, respectively, with total combined
economic and health care costs potentially reaching €163 million and €1.25 billion.
Conclusions: EDCs (diphenyldichloroethene and phthalates) may contribute substantially to the
most common reproductive disorders in women, endometriosis and fibroids, costing nearly €1.5
billionannually.TheseestimatesrepresentonlyEDCsforwhichthereweresufficientepidemiologic
studies and those with the highest probability of causation. These public health costs should be
considered as the EU contemplates regulatory action on EDCs. (J Clin Endocrinol Metab 101:

n 2007, Buck Louis and Cooney postulated that envi-
ronmentalfactorscanimpactthedevelopingovaryand
female reproductive tract, inducing structural and func-
tional changes that may manifest as reproductive disor-
ders later in life and predispose women to complex dis-
eases such as cancer. This conceptual framework was
termedtheovariandysgenesissyndrome(ODS)(1,2),par-
alleling the testicular dysgenesis syndrome, which links
similar interrelated health endpoints across the lifespan in
males after periconceptional or in utero exposures (3).
The most compelling support for ODS comes from the
human diethylstilbestrol (DES) exposure paradigm. DES
is a synthetic estrogen prescribed from the 1940s to 1970s
to pregnant women with “high-risk” pregnancies in an
attempt to prevent miscarriage. The reproductive reper-
cussions of fetal DES exposure became evident when cases
of a rare vaginal clear cell adenocarcinoma were observed
in young DES daughters (4, 5). Subsequent data from
nearly 50 years of DES cohort studies provides clear evi-
dence that in utero, DES exposure increased the incidence
of a host of reproductive abnormalities in women, includ-
ing vaginal adenosis, cervical and vaginal hypoplasia,
uterine and tubal abnormalities, infertility, early meno-
pause, and breast cancer (6, 7). Some associations are re-
ported for in utero DES exposure and the presence of male
urogenital abnormalities and complex medical diseases
later in adulthood (8, 9), although the mechanisms of ac-
tion are unclear (10).
Importantly, support for the ODS hypothesis also
comes from the results of subsequent experimental studies
in rodents that recapitulated and extended the human
findings. For example, exposure during pre-/perinatal de-
velopment is associated with an increased risk of leiomy-
oma in the adult in both DES exposed women (11–13) and
mice (14), and with changes in the expression of estrogen-
responsive genes in adult uterine tissue (15).
Although the effects of DES exposure on fertility likely
result from changes to both the ovary and reproductive
tract, ovarian effects are difficult to characterize. This is
not surprising, because subtle changes to the developing
ovary with or without changes in hormonal signaling can
manifest as a wide range of phenotypes. These include
diminished fecundity (longer time-to-pregnancy), repro-
ductive impairment (eg, conception delay or pregnancy
loss), infertility, or gynecological disorders such as endo-
metriosis, fibroids, premature ovarian insufficiency/fail-
ure, or polycystic ovarian syndrome (PCOS). Biological
plausibilitythatrelativelyminorchangesinthedeveloping
ovary has lifelong consequences is demonstrated by the
link between maternal smoking and reduced fecundity in
daughters although effects on the fetal ovary are subtle
(16). Of added concern are the increasingly reported as-
sociations between infertility or gynecological disorders
and gravid diseases such as type 2 diabetes (17), not to
mention later onset adulthood diseases. Such examples
include a higher risk of autoimmune disorders and cancer
for women with endometriosis and PCOS, a higher risk of
gestational diabetes and metabolic or cardiovascular dis-
ease among women with PCOS, and a greater risk of can-
cer among infertile women in comparison with unaffected
women (18–25).
Although a growing body of evidence supports the
ODS conceptual paradigm and the vulnerability of the
developing ovary to the actions of endocrine-disrupting
chemicals (EDCs) (26), characterizing the effects of expo-
sures on the developing ovary remains a formidable re-
search challenge. In part, this can be attributed to the “hid-
den” data problem, the inability to observe early
reproductive endpoints in females relative to males with-
out invasive procedures. Such hidden endpoints include
some of the earliest gene- and sperm-related contributions
to the developing embryo, all of which occur before im-
plantation. These early endpoints are well suited to inves-
tigation in population subgroups, such as couples under-
going
assisted
reproductive
technologies
and
such
initiatives are underway for select EDCs and oocyte mat-
uration or blastocyst formation (27). However, the ability
to link exposures during development to ovarian function
in adult women remains a critical data gap.
Incontrasttothecomplexovarianphenotype,effectsof
environmental exposures on the female reproductive tract
can manifest as gross structural changes (such as endo-
metriosis and fibroids) that are easier to characterize. To-
gether, endometriosis and fibroids represent the most
common female reproductive disorders with an estimated
combined incidence of up to 70% of women overall (28–
31). Given their cryptic nature, many women with either
endometriosis or fibroids remain asymptomatic or undi-
agnosed and gynecological comorbidity may exist. As
such, estimating incidences at the population level relies
on prevalence estimates largely from women seeking clin-
ical care. Nevertheless, an estimated 176 million women
worldwide have been diagnosed with endometriosis (32,
33). Among women undergoing surgeries that allow for
visual diagnosis, endometriosis has been reported in
30%–50% of pelvic surgery patients and 4%–43% of
tubal sterilization patients, irrespective of presenting signs
and symptoms (34–38). Estimating the incidence of uter-
ine fibroids poses similar problems. Although some 20%–
40% of women of childbearing age are affected, disease
incidence is strongly influenced by both age and race and,
in some populations the lifetime risk may be as high as
60% (39, 40).

 Because they are leading causes of female infertility and
a range of other conditions affecting quality of life such as
pain (41), these reproductive disorders impose a high per-
sonal burden. In addition, they also represent a major so-
cietal burden, representing a substantial portion of the
health care costs for women and a leading cause of work
disturbances and lost productivity. In terms of estimated
annual costs per woman in the European Union (EU),
health and lost productivity together cost around €8000,
whereas hospital costs alone for fibroid treatment average
over €3000 (42–45). Furthermore, the rising incidences of
endometriosis and fibroids with age (46) increases the risk
ofcomorbidity,whichwillmultiplythecostburdensofthe
diseases.
The Endocrine Society recently released its second Sci-
entific Statement on EDCs (47). This document reviews
the mechanistic, experimental, and epidemiological evi-
dence for the role of EDCs in the genesis and progression
of obesity and diabetes, female and male reproductive dis-
orders, hormone-sensitive cancers in females, prostate
cancer, and developmental and functional disorders of the
thyroid and neuroendocrine systems. Importantly, the
mode of action of EDCs in the body is varied, complex,
and dependent upon both the tissue and developmental
stage of exposure (eg, see table 2 in Ref. 47). Nevertheless,
as summarized in the Endocrine Society statement, evi-
dence for effects of a host of EDCs, including bisphenol A,
phthalates, pesticides, and persistent organic pollutants
(POPs) on the developing ovary and reproductive tract is
growing into a compelling body of evidence.
The prevention of EDC exposures has the potential to
minimizetheonsetandprogressionoffemalereproductive
diseases in the EU, and the resultant reduction in associ-
ated health care and other social costs could have major
economic implications. Thus, cost information is essential
in the context of regulatory decisions. We therefore ex-
tended previous estimates of societal cost (48–51), exam-
ining the probability of causation of female reproductive
conditions for EDCs, and quantifying the potential asso-
ciated costs and burden of disease.
Materials and Methods
The expert panel focused on 2 exposure-outcome relationships:
adult diphenyldichloroethene (DDE) exposure with fibroids and
adult phthalate exposure with endometriosis. The expert panel
considered dioxins, polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs) and other
persistent pollutants, but following the approach of other man-
uscripts in this series (48–51), the panel chose not to examine
these chemicals, because they are already regulated under the
Stockholm Convention. The panel selected these exposure-out-
come relationships because of the availability of well-conducted
observational human studies to assess effects of these EDCs on
female reproductive disorders. The panel recognized that sub-
stantial laboratory studies suggest effects of earlier female re-
productive tract perturbations as a result of developmental ex-
posures in animal (52) but noted an absence of longitudinal
studies to assess such effects in humans. We adhered to the ap-
proach described in the accompanying overarching manuscript
in evaluating strength of the epidemiological (using the World
Health Organization GRADE Working Group criteria) (53, 54)
and toxicological literature (using criteria consistent with that
proposed in the EU roadmap for evaluating endocrine disrup-
tors) (55, 56), and to assigning probability of causation
(adapting the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change
criteria) (57).
Modeling DDE exposures among adult females in
the EU
We used data pooled from twelve European birth cohorts by
Govarts et al, in which measured maternal and cord blood levels
of DDE as ng/g (58). 10th, 25th, 50th, 75th, and 90th percentiles
in cord serum were converted to maternal serum levels using a
conversion factor of 0.2:1, as described by the authors. For the
purpose of this analysis, the distribution of DDE metabolites in
nonpregnant women in the EU was assumed to match the dis-
tributions obtained for pregnant women from the pooled Euro-
pean birth cohort data.
Modeling phthalate exposures among adult
females in the EU
10th, 25th, 50th, 75th, and 90th percentiles for mothers
were obtained from the Demonstration of a Study to Coordinate
and Perform Human Biomonitoring on a European Scale
(DEMOCOPHES) for the sum of di-(2-ethylhexyl) phthalate
(DEHP) metabolites, monoethylphthalate, monoisobutylphtha-
late, monobutylphthalate, and monobenzylphthalate in urine
from general population samples (59). Molar concentrations
were estimated by dividing concentrations in ng/mL by the ap-
propriate molecular weight, multiplying by 1000. For the pur-
pose of this analysis, the distribution of phthalate metabolites in
women in the EU was assumed to be identical to the distributions
obtained for mothers from DEMOCOPHES data.
Modeling DDE-attributable fibroids
Women in the EU between the ages of 15 and 54 years in the
year 2010 were assumed to have a distribution of DDE levels
corresponding to those identified by Govarts et al (58) and di-
vided into percentile ranges on the basis of their DDE measure-
ments (0th–9th, 10th–24th, 25th–49th, 50th–74th, 75th–89th,
and 90th–99th percentiles). The lowest grouping was treated as
a reference category, whereas the other groups were assumed to
have levels corresponding to the lower value of the interval (eg,
10th percentile for all women in the 10th–24th percentile group-
ing). The panel took the exposure-response relationship from a
study of DDE and fibroids in a large cohort of women under-
going laparoscopy or laparotomy for gynecological complaints
(n � 473) (60). The published odds ratio (OR) was applied to the
exposure distribution of the population subdivided into 0th–9th,
10th–24th, 25th–49th, 50th–74th, 75th–89th, and 90th–99th
percentiles. Having calculated the appropriate OR for each ex-
posed group, the OR was multiplied against the incidence rate
surgical/radiological interventions for myomas. For incidence

 data inputs, we used incidence rates from an analysis of large
national databases from England, Germany, and France (42). A
population-weighted average of incidence rates from the 3 coun-
tries was applied to the other European countries in our study.
These rates were applied against population estimates of 15- to
54-year-old women in 2010 from Eurostat to estimate the num-
ber of DDE-attributable incident interventions for myomas (61).
Modeling phthalate-attributable endometriosis
The expert panel selected a study of phthalates and endome-
triosis in population and operative cohorts that identified sig-
nificant associations of DEHP metabolites with endometriosis
(62). For the purpose of analysis, women between the ages of
20–44 years in Europe were assumed to have urinary phthalate
concentrations corresponding to the 10th, 25th, 50th, 75th, and
90th percentile of adults in the DEMOCOPHES project. The
population of 20- to 44-year-old women was divided into per-
centile ranges (0th–9th, 10th–24th, 25th–49th, 50th–74th,
75th–89th, and 90th–99th percentiles). The lowest grouping
was the reference category, whereas the other groups were as-
sumed to have levels corresponding to the lowest extreme (eg,
10th percentile for all women in the 10th–24th percentile group-
ing). ORs were calculated by exponentiating the endometriosis
OR identified for DEHP metabolites to the ratio of the estimated
concentration to 0.2 ng/mL. The baseline incidence of endome-
triosis was obtained from a German national analysis (63) and
multiplied by the appropriate OR to identify the exposed rate of
endometriosis. After subtracting the unexposed rate of endome-
triosis, the incremental rate of endometriosis within each group
was multiplied by country-level population estimates obtained
from Eurostat for 20- to 44-year-old women in 2010 (61), and
the appropriate percentage of the country population corre-
sponding to the percentile range, to estimate attributable cases.
Economic cost estimates for fibroids
Costs per case for surgical/radiologic interventions for myo-
mas were identified from an analysis of large national databases
from England, Germany, and France (42). A population-
weighted average of costs per case from the 3 countries was
applied to the other European countries in our study, after fur-
ther adjustment by the ratio of each country’s per capita gross
domestic product to that of Germany, to account for differences
in purchasing power across the EU (64). To update the cost
estimates from 2005 to 2010, 4% annual increases in costs per
casewereapplied,accountingforwell-documentedtrendsacross
Europe in medical costs (65).
Economic cost estimates for endometriosis
Costs per patient were adapted from 2009 estimates in Bel-
gium, accounting for direct medical costs, as well as lost eco-
nomic productivity and other indirect costs (66). Further adjust-
ment was made by multiplying the ratio of each country’s per
capita gross domestic product to that of Belgium, to account for
differences in purchasing power across the EU (64). To update
the cost estimates from 2009 to 2010, 4% annual increases in
costs per case were applied, accounting for well-documented
trends across Europe in medical costs (65).
Results
DDE-attributable fibroids
The panel considered the evidence supporting a role for
both a predisposing effect of developmental exposures as
well as an effect of adult exposures on the development of
fibroids. In rodents, DES exposure during fetal develop-
ment induces alterations to the developing reproductive
tract that are remarkably similar to those reported in DES
daughters (67). Importantly, rodent models also provide
evidence that developmental exposures to other EDCs in-
duce similar effects (68–70). Thus, it is important to note
that other EDCs, including methoxychlor and the POPs,
PCBs, and dichlorodiphenyltrichloroethane (DDT), have
been implicated in the development of uterine fibroid dis-
ease (71–73). These toxicological studies support an en-
docrine disruptor mode of action for adverse health im-
pacts due to chemical exposures. Based on these data, the
expert panel evaluated the animal/experimental toxico-
logical data supporting POP causation of fibroids to be
moderate, based upon the limited literature.
In addition to studies of the effects of developmental
exposures, we found 11 studies of fibroids in adult women
that examined a variety of environmental exposures, in-
cluding phthalates, POPs, phenols, trace elements, and
dietary/lifestyle (Supplemental Table 1) (60, 75–80). The
body of evidence is observational in nature largely stem-
ming from available groups of women for study. As such,
authors used various designs (many cross-sectional), de-
fined exposures and outcomes differently, and either did
or did not consider other covariates. The panel chose the
Trabert et al (60) study for calculations based on: the large
sample size (n � 473) recruited from 14 clinical centers,
diagnosis by ultrasonography or at laparoscopy and the
use appropriate methods for exposure characterization in
serum and omental fat for lipophilic chemicals. None of
the other studies were able to incorporate all of these fac-
tors into their study design. When excluding women di-
agnosed with endometriosis, the authors reported several
PCBs that were significantly associated with an increased
risk of fibroids. The ability to quantify lipophilic chemi-
cals in omental fat is a strength, as serum concentrations
are only proxy of internal dose. To our knowledge, no
study has been conducted to follow the offspring of
women whose exposures have been quantified during sen-
sitive windows of development (from preconception
through adulthood) and in various biologic media that
would allow for the estimation of the onset and progres-
sion of gynecologic disorders including fibroids. Such
work will be possible in the near future in light of several
birth cohort studies with children approaching adoles-
cence or young adulthood. In considering the entire evi-

 dence base, the expert panel rated the epidemiologic evi-
dence for causation of fibroids by DDE exposure to be
low. Together, the epidemiological and toxicological eval-
uations resulted in the expert panel endorsing a 20%–
39% probability of causation of fibroids by DDE.
Applying the OR from the Trabert et al (60) study to
DDE biomarker data from twelve countries in the EU and
using the 10th percentile as a reference level, results in OR
estimates for fibroids of 1.11–1.51. Applying this to a
2.227/1000 annual incidence rate, incremental prevalence
in the EU attributable to DDE ranges between 2.45/
10 000 and 1.15/1000 for the most highly exposed quan-
tiles of the population (Table 1). Thus, in 2010, an esti-
mated 56 700 women underwent interventions for
myoma requiring surgical attention attributable to adult
DDE exposures. These cases cost €163 million.
Phthalate-attributable endometriosis
The panel identified evidence to support the hypothesis
that exposures quantified shortly before the disease diag-
nosis are associated with incident disease in women. Ex-
perimentalevidencesuggeststhataftertheimplantationof
human endometrial tissue into the mesentery of rats and
mice, 12 weeks of tetrachlorodibenzo-p-dioxin (TCDD)
treatment resulted in a significant induction of endome-
triosis in both rodent species (81). Important primate data
also suggest a dose-dependent association in both the in-
cidence and severity of endometriosis in a cohort of rhesus
monkeys exposed chronically to TCDD (82). Subse-
quently, specific PCB congeners (numbers 77 and 126)
also were associated with endometriosis in this same col-
ony of rhesus monkeys (83). Collectively these emerging
studies suggest an endocrine disruptor mode of action for
TCDD and PCB-specific congeners leading to the devel-
opment of endometriosis. Of note, the rhesus monkey ex-
periments were longitudinal in nature and conducted in a
primate model that is physiologically similar to humans.
Therefore, the expert panel felt that these were very high
quality experiments supporting adverse effects resulting
from an endocrine disruptor mode of action from TCDD
and PCB studies. On the basis of these limited data, the
expert panel extrapolated a potential endocrine mode of
action in animal/experimental toxicological supporting
phthalate causation of endometriosis to be moderate.
Evidence linking classes of environmental chemicals to
endometriosis in humans is rapidly emerging, with
approximately 34 publications examining a variety of
chemicals including heavy metals, POPs, phthalates, and
bisphenol A (Supplemental Table 2). Significant method-
ological limitations (eg, varying methods of recruitment,
disease criteria, methods for detection and quantification
of analytes, and inadequate statistical power) preclude the
use of most these studies in evaluating the role of EDCs in
the development of endometriosis. Eight of the 34 publi-
cationsfocusedonphthalatesastheprimaryexposure(62,
84–86, 88–90). The panel evaluated all 8 studies; several
were rejected due to small sample size, and several others
were judged to have important methodological limita-
tions, including reliance on self-reported endometriosis
rather than the gold standard of surgically visualized dis-
ease, inappropriate comparison groups, or assessment of
phthalate exposure occurring after diagnosis. The expert
panel found the Buck Louis et al (62,84-86,88-90) study
to be the most responsive to data gaps and other method-
ological considerations including modern exposure as-
sessment, recruitment technique using age and residence
matching, direct surgical visualization of outcome in op-
erative cohort, and large sample size. In this study, a pop-
ulation based sample of 495 women undergoing operative
evaluation for endometriosis was compared with an age
and residence matched population sample of 131 women,
and 6 different phthalate metabolites were significantly
associated with a 2-fold increase in the odds of endome-
triosis diagnosis in the population cohort. Among women
undergoing surgery, mono-octyl phthalate was associated
with significantly increased ORs of 1.38 (95% confidence
interval 1.10, 1.72) based on direct surgical visualization
and mono-2-ethylhexyl phthalate 1.35 (95% confidence
interval 1.03, 1.78) when restricting comparison with
women with a normal pelvis. Based on the quality of the
adult epidemiologic data, the panel assigned the quality of

 epidemiologic evidence as low based on the limited liter-
ature and methodological considerations in light of the
emerging research in the field. These evaluations resulted
in the expert panel endorsing a 20%–39% probability of
causation of endometriosis by phthalates.
To estimate attributable disease burden, the panel used
a large cohort study (n � 495) that identified a dose-re-
sponse relationship between urinary phthalate measure-
ments obtained contemporaneously with the diagnosis of
endometriosis (62). Applying an OR of 1.35 per log unit
increase in total phthalates to European urinary total
phthalate measurements from DEMOCOPHES (Table 2),
the incremental incidence attributable to phthalates
ranged from 1.21/1000 to 2.82/1000. In total, this anal-
ysis suggests that 145 000 cases of endometriosis among
20- to 44-year-old women, with associated costs of €1.25
billion in 2010, were attributable to phthalates.
Discussion
The main finding of our study is that EDC exposure may
contribute to causation of fibroids and endometriosis,
with associated costs in the EU of approximately €1.41
billion annually. This suggests that prevention of expo-
sures to DDE and phthalates alone would substantially
reduce disease and disability among European women
while decreasing health care expenditures and other social
costs.
We applied a conservative approach to the difficult task
of attributing disease burden and costs of EDC exposure
in the female, focusing on 2 of the most common female
conditions that are also among the most straightforward
in terms of assessing the role of EDCs in etiology. It is
important to note that our approach has several limita-
tions that almost certainly result in a substantial under-
estimation of attributing disease burden. First, our anal-
ysis focused only on adult exposures. Despite the growing
body of experimental data linking EDC exposure during
fetal development with reproductive aberrations in the
adult (74), and aside from the iatrogenic effects on off-
springofprescribingDEStopregnantwomen,thereareno
epidemiologicaldataknowntouslinkingfetalexposureto
reproductive abnormalities in adult women. Furthermore,
reliance upon animal model studies is complicated by spe-
cies-specificdifferencesinbiologyandsensitivitytoand/or
clearance of EDCs, necessitating careful assessment of an-
imal model findings for human relevance. Fetal exposure,
however, has the potential to affect reproduction by mul-
tiple routes (eg, by interfering with the development of the
brain, reproductive tract, and ovary), and likely poses
the greatest risk to female reproductive health. Although
the 20- to 30-year gap between exposure and the recog-
nition of reproductive impairment (or even longer in terms
of diagnoses such as premature menopause) presents chal-
lenges in establishing etiologic links, ongoing birth cohort
studies around the globe provide hope for updating the
burden of disease and cost estimates presented here in the
near future. Nevertheless, the absence of existing studies
of fetal and periconceptional exposures which are impor-
tant windows of exposure prevented inclusion of attribu-
tion for these exposures, and represents a major limitation
of this analysis presented here, one that likely underesti-
mates attributable disease burden.
Second, our analysis only focused on specific reproduc-
tive tract disorders. Because characterizing the effects of
exposures on the developing ovary remains a formidable
research challenge, the panel elected to focus on 2 major
reproductive tract abnormalities, fibroids and endometri-
osis. Although it is highly appropriate to focus on these
extremely important uterine tract health deficits, PCOS,
infertility and pregnancy complications also affect a con-
siderable number of women, have major cost implications
and are increasingly linked to EDC exposures. Thus, it is
important to recognize that the cost burdens calculated in
this analysis do not represent all, or even most, of the
reproductive costs associated with human female expo-
sure. Exposure of the mother during gestation can lead to
poorer health and function of the offspring, and also will
have considerable cost implications in terms of maternal
stress-induced illness and lost productivity due to child-
care burdens. Indeed, given the importance of the uterine
environment and of postnatal maternal care, using disease

 management costs alone provides an incomplete assess-
ment of cost burden. Further, the cost analysis of the 2
gynecological disorders was limited to health care costs
and lost work time directly associated with disease treat-
ment, and did not take into account the increasingly re-
ported associations between infertility, gynecological dis-
orders, gravid diseases, or other later onset adulthood
diseases. Important examples include a higher risk of au-
toimmune disorders and cancer for women with endome-
triosis, a higher risk of gestational diabetes and metabolic
or cardiovascular disease among women with PCOS, and
a greater risk of cancer among infertile women in com-
parison with unaffected women (18–25). Thus, even this
attempt to restrict the analysis of cost burden to 2 specific
reproductive tract disorders must be considered an under-
estimate of the exposure-associated cost burden from an
overall health perspective.
Finally, this analysis does not represent the cost to fe-
male reproductive health of exposure to all EDCs. For
reasons of extensive data gaps already outlined, we only
quantified attributable burden for 2 classes of EDCs,
DDEs and phthalates. Many other EDCs with similar
modes of action likely adversely affect female health and
function. The polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons represent
a large and ubiquitous class of chemicals with extensive
exposure profiles. These compounds act via an extensive
range of mechanisms and receptors, including the aryl hy-
drocarbon and estrogen receptors and have been associ-
ated with adverse outcomes in offspring (85) and have
known effects on reproductive organs (87). Thus, analysis
of the burden imposed by exposure only to DDEs and
phthalates is a further source of potential underestimation
of the health burden and cost implications of EDC
exposure.
Despite the complexities of the field and the numerous
caveats outlined above, the present analysis provides some
evidence of the health care burden imposed by the 2 most
common female reproductive tract disorders, endometri-
osis and fibroids. If, as we suggest, our analysis provides
a conservative estimate that represents the “tip of the ice-
berg,” the greater than €1.41 billion per annum cost es-
timated for the clinical management of 2 reproductive
tract diseases associated with exposure to 2 EDCs suggests
that new measures to prevent EDC exposure might have
considerable personal and economic benefits.
