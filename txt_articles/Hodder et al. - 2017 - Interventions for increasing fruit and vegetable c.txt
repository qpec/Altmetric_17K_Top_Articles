Background
Insufficient consumption of fruits and vegetables in childhood increases the risk of future chronic diseases, including cardiovascular
disease.
Objectives
To assess the effectiveness, cost effectiveness and associated adverse events of interventions designed to increase the consumption of
fruit, vegetables or both amongst children aged five years and under.
Search methods
We searched the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL) in the Cochrane Library, MEDLINE, Embase Classic
and Embase to identify eligible trials on 30 September 2016. We searched CINAHL and PsycINFO in July 2016, Proquest Dissertations
and Theses in November 2016 and three clinical trial registers in November 2016 and June 2017. We reviewed reference lists of
included trials and handsearched three international nutrition journals. We contacted authors of included studies to identify further
potentially relevant trials.
Selection criteria
We included randomised controlled trials, including cluster-randomised controlled trials and cross-over trials, of any intervention
primarily targeting consumption of fruit, vegetables or both among children aged five years and under, and incorporating a dietary or
biochemical assessment of fruit or vegetable consumption. Two review authors independently screened titles and abstracts of identified
papers; a third review author resolved disagreements.

 Data collection and analysis
Two review authors independently extracted data and assessed the risks of bias of included studies; a third review author resolved
disagreements. Due to unexplained heterogeneity, we used random-effects models in meta-analyses for the primary review outcomes
where we identified sufficient trials. We calculated standardised mean differences (SMDs) to account for the heterogeneity of fruit and
vegetable consumption measures.We conducted assessments of risks of bias and evaluated the quality of evidence (GRADE approach)
using Cochrane procedures.
Main results
We included 50 trials with 137 trial arms and 10,267 participants. Thirty trials examined the impact of child-feeding practices (e.g.
repeated food exposure) in increasing child vegetable intake. Eleven trials examined the impact of parent nutrition education in
increasing child fruit and vegetable intake. Eight studies examined the impact of multicomponent interventions (e.g. parent nutrition
education and preschool policy changes) in increasing child fruit and vegetable intake. One study examined the effect of a nutrition
intervention delivered to children in increasing child fruit and vegetable intake.
Thirteen of the 50 included trials were judged as free from high risks of bias across all domains; performance, detection and attrition
bias were the most common domains judged at high risk of bias of remaining studies.
Meta-analysis of trials examining child-feeding practices versus no intervention revealed a positive effect on child vegetable consumption
(SMD 0.38, 95% CI 0.15 to 0.61; n = 1509; 11 studies; very low-quality evidence), equivalent to a mean difference of 4.03 grams
of vegetables. There were no short-term differences in child consumption of fruit and vegetables in meta-analyses of trials examining
parent nutrition education versus no intervention (SMD 0.11, 95% CI -0.05 to 0.28; n = 3023; 10 studies; very low-quality evidence)
or multicomponent interventions versus no intervention (SMD 0.28, 95% CI -0.06 to 0.63; n = 1861; 4 studies; very low-quality
evidence).
Insufficient data were available to assess long-term effectiveness, cost effectiveness and unintended adverse consequences of interven-
tions.Studies reported receiving governmental or charitable funds, except for two studies reporting industry funding.
Authors’ conclusions
Despite identifying 50 eligible trials of various intervention approaches, the evidence for how to increase fruit and vegetable consumption
of children remains sparse. There was very low-quality evidence child-feeding practice interventions are effective in increasing vegetable
consumption of children aged five years and younger, however the effect size was very small and long-term follow-up is required. There
was very low-quality evidence that parent nutrition education and multicomponent interventions are not effective in increasing fruit
and vegetable consumption of children aged five years and younger. All findings should be considered with caution, given most included
trials could not be combined in meta-analyses. Given the very low-quality evidence, future research will very likely change estimates
and conclusions. Such research should adopt more rigorous methods to advance the field.
This is a living systematic review. Living systematic reviews offer a new approach to review updating, in which the review is continually
updated, incorporating relevant new evidence as it becomes available. Please refer to the Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews for
the current status of this review.

Interventions for increasing eating of fruit and vegetables in children aged five years and under
Background
Consuming not enough fruit and vegetables is a considerable health burden in developed countries. Eating fruit and vegetables is
associated with a reduced risk of future chronic disease. Early childhood represents a critical period for the establishment of dietary
habits. Interventions to increase consumption of fruit and vegetables in early childhood may therefore be an effective strategy in reducing
this disease burden.
Review question
To assess the impact of interventions designed to increase eating of fruit or vegetables or both among children aged five years and under.
Methods

 We searched various electronic databases and relevant journals to find studies. We contacted authors of included trials for additional
potentially relevant trials. Any randomised trial (participants have the same chance of being assigned to treatment or control) was
eligible of interventions aiming to increase the intake of fruit or vegetables or both by children aged five years and under that measured
intake. Two review authors independently searched for and extracted information from studies. The evidence is current to September
2016.
Results
We include 50 trials with 10,267 people taking part. Thirty examined child-feeding interventions, 11 examined parent nutrition
education interventions, eight examined multicomponent interventions and one examined a child nutrition education intervention.
Child-feeding interventions (e.g. repeated exposure to vegetables) were effective in increasing children’s intake of vegetables in the short
term (less than 12 months). Parent nutrition education and multicomponent interventions (e.g. combining preschool policy changes
with parent education) were not effective in increasing children’s eating of fruit and vegetables. There was not enough information to
assess long-term effectiveness, cost effectiveness and unintended harms. Studies reporting funding support received governmental or
charitable funds, except for two studies that received industry funding.
Conclusions
The evidence for effective interventions to increase eating of fruit and vegetables by children aged five and under remains sparse. Child-
feeding interventions appear to increase the eating of vegetables by children (by 4.03 grams), but this conclusion is based on very low-
quality evidence and is very likely to change when future research is undertaken.
This is a living systematic review. Living systematic reviews offer a new approach to review updating, in which the review is continually
updated, incorporating relevant new evidence as it becomes available. Please refer to the Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews for
the current status of this review.

CI: Confidence interval
GRADE Working Group grades of evidence
High quality: We are very confident that the true effect lies close to that of the estimate of the effect
Moderate quality: We are moderately confident in the effect estimate: The true effect is likely to be close to the estimate of the effect, but there is a possibility that it is
substantially different
Low quality: Our confidence in the effect estimate is limited: The true effect may be substantially different from the estimate of the effect

Description of the condition
Chronic diseases are illnesses which are typically prolonged in du-
ration, do not resolve spontaneously and are rarely cured com-
pletely (Australian Institute of Health and Welfare 2017). Insuf-
ficient consumption of fruits and vegetables is associated with a
range of chronic diseases, such as cancer and cardiovascular disease
(World Health Organization 2003; World Health Organization
2011). Globally, 2.8% of all deaths and 1.0% of all disability-ad-
justed life years (DALYs) each year are attributable to inadequate
fruit and vegetable intake (World Health Organization 2017).
Low fruit and vegetable consumption is responsible for 14% of
gastrointestinal cancer deaths, 11% of all ischaemic heart disease
and 9% of all stroke deaths (World Health Organization 2017).
Increasing global fruit and vegetable intake therefore represents a
public health priority and has the capacity to reduce the burden of
coronary heart disease by 31%, oesophageal cancer by 20%, and
Ischaemic stroke by 19% (Lock 2005).
To reduce the risk of chronic diseases, consumption of at least
400 grams a day of fruit and vegetables is recommended (World
Health Organization 1997; World Health Organization 2017).
Nationally representative surveys, however, indicate that through-
out most regions of the globe, daily consumption of fruits and
vegetables is well below such recommendations (Lock 2005).
Population surveys of children indicate the need to increase
the intake of fruits and vegetables (Lock 2005; World Health
Organization 2004a; Yngve 2005). For example, less than a third
of school-aged children from European nations report consuming
vegetables on a daily basis (World Health Organization 2004a).
Data from younger children is similar. A survey conducted in 2007
to 2010 in the USA reported 33% of children aged one to three
years met fruit recommendations and 13% met vegetable recom-
mendations (National Cancer Institute 2015). A national survey
in 2011 to 2012 in Australia reported 90% of children aged two
to eight years consume the recommended number of fruit serves
a day, and 49% of children aged two to three years consume the
recommended serves of vegetables (Australian Bureau of Statistics
2014). Globally, the mean intake of fruit and vegetables is below
the World Health Organization (WHO) recommendations across
all WHO regions. South American, African, and South East Asian
nations report the lowest quantities of child fruit and vegetable in-
take, where school-aged children typically consume less than 300
grams a day (Lock 2005).
There is some evidence from longitudinal studies to suggest that
eating behaviours established in childhood are likely to persist into
adulthood (Lien 2001; Mikkilä 2004). Additionally, longitudinal
studies have shown that fruit and vegetable consumption in child-
hood is associated with reductions in chronic diseases in adulthood
(Maynard 2003; Ness 2005). Encouraging healthy eating among
children may therefore represent an effective primary prevention
strategy for reducing the risk of chronic diseases (Boeing 2012;
Centers for Disease Control and Prevention 2011; Maynard 2003;
Ness2005; WorldHealth Organization 2004b). Thirty-seven-year
follow-up data from the Boyd Orr cohort study of British children,
for example, found lower rates of all-cause cardiovascular mortal-
ity among children with greater intake of vegetables in childhood
(Ness 2005). Adequate fruit and vegetable intake during child-
hood may also have a number of immediate benefits, including
reducing the risk of micronutrient deficiencies and a number of
respiratory illnesses (Antova 2003; Boeing 2012; Forastiere 2005;
World Health Organization 2003).
Description of the intervention
The aetiology of fruit and vegetable consumption is complex, in-
volving the dynamic interaction of a variety of factors. Given such
complexity, a number of frameworks have been produced to guide
the development of interventions to increase fruit and vegetable
intake (Centers for Disease Control and Prevention 2011; Klepp
2005; Miller 2000; World Health Organization 2004b). The con-
ceptual framework developed for the international Pro Children
Project suggests that interventions targeting a variety of cultural,
physical and social environment factors, as well as those targeting
personal factors, may be effective in positively influencing fruit
and vegetable intake among children (Klepp 2005).
Despite the range of potential intervention targets, including pri-
mordial prevention interventions that target the risk factors of
chronic disease before they occur (compared to primary preven-
tion interventions that treat risk factors of chronic disease), pre-
vious trials have tended to focus on those determinants more
amenable to intervention, such as nutrition knowledge and skills,
or the food environment of settings such as schools (Hector 2008).
Among school-aged children, systematic reviews suggest that the
strongest evidence exists for the efficacy of multicomponent inter-
ventions with elements such as curriculum, parental engagement,
policy and food environment changes (Blanchette 2005; De Sa
2008; Jaime 2009; Knai 2006; Van Cauwenberghe 2010). Pre-
vious reviews in children aged five years and younger (Campbell
2007; Hesketh 2010; Tedstone 1998) have similarly found some
evidence for multicomponent interventions. Primordial preven-
tion interventions targeting preschool-aged children also demon-
strate consistent evidence. For example, an intervention aiming
to prevent the onset of cardiovascular disease in preschoolers tar-
geted multiple risk factors, including child fruit and vegetable
consumption (Peñalvo 2013a; Peñalvo 2013b). The multicompo-
nent intervention including curriculum, school environment and
family components successfully improved preschoolers’ fruit and
vegetable habits, which were also maintained over time (Peñalvo
2013a; Peñalvo 2013b; Peñalvo 2015).

 How the intervention might work
A number of theories have been used to explain a mechanism by
which interventions may influence children’s fruit and vegetable
consumption (Rasmussen 2006). In most instances, psychosocial
theoriessuch asSocial Cognitive Theory(Bandura 1986), the The-
ory of Planned Behaviour (Ajzen 1991), or the Stages of Change
Trans-theoretical Model (Prochaska 1984) have been used to ex-
plain possible causal pathways to fruit and vegetable consumption
(Rasmussen 2006). Collectively, such theories assert that changes
in attitudes, knowledge and skills and perceived norms and ex-
pectancies are required for behavioural change. The international
Pro Children Project incorporated Social-Ecological Theory in
its conceptual theoretical framework of determinants of children’s
fruit and vegetable consumption (Klepp 2005). Interventions de-
rived from Social-Ecological Theory recognise the importance of
more structural influences on children’s intake of fruit and veg-
etable consumption, for example, the availability or accessibility
of fruit and vegetables in the home or in settings such as schools
which children frequent.
Why it is important to do this review
Previous reviews have identified a number of factors associated
with fruit and vegetable consumption among children (Blanchette
2005; Pearson 2008; Rasmussen 2006; Van der Horst 2007).
While such reviews provide important information for the devel-
opment of interventions, only systematic reviews of intervention
trials can determine the efficacy of strategies to increase child fruit
and vegetable consumption. A number of such reviews have been
published (Burchett 2003; Ciliska 2000; Delgado-Noguera 2011;
De Sa 2008; Evans 2012; French 2003; Hendrie 2017; Howerton
2007; Knai2006; Savoie-Roskos 2017; VanCauwenberghe 2010).
However, only a few have focused specifically on children aged
five years and under (Campbell 2007; Hesketh 2010; Tedstone
1998). Of these, most lacked important information relevant to
practice, such as the effectiveness of interventions for various sub-
populations (such as minority groups), the cost effectiveness of
interventions, or the presence of any unintended adverse effects of
the intervention. Similarly, as positive impacts of health behaviour
interventions may not be sustained, an examination of the longer-
term effectiveness of interventions (more than 12 months post-
intervention) is important for policy-makers and practitioners to
assess the potential health benefits of fruit and vegetable inter-
ventions (Fjeldsoe 2011; Jones 2011). Previous reviews have not
specifically examined the impact of interventions based on the
length of post-intervention follow-up. A comprehensive system-
atic review on this issue is therefore required to provide guidance
for practitioners and policy-makers interested in implementing
strategies to promote the consumption of fruits and vegetables in
early childhood.
Following the publication of this 2017 update of the review, we
will maintain it as a living systematic review, as a pilot up until the
end of March 2018. This means we will be continually running the
searches and rapidly incorporating any newly-identified evidence
into the review (for more information about the living systematic
review approach being piloted by Cochrane, see Appendix 1). We
believe a living systematic review approach is appropriate for this
review, for three reasons. First, the review addresses a particularly
important public health issue; the growing burden of disease and
mortality attributable to low fruit and vegetable intake. Insuffi-
cient consumption of fruits and vegetables is associated with a
range of chronic diseases such as cancer and cardiovascular dis-
ease, and in most regions of the globe current daily consumption
of fruits and vegetables is well below the recommended intake to
reduce the risk of chronic diseases. Early childhood represents a
critical period for the establishment of healthy eating behaviours,
such as fruit and vegetable intake, as dietary habits developed early
are likely to persist into adulthood. It is therefore important to
better understand how to improve intake of fruits and vegetables
during childhood. Secondly, there remains uncertainty in the ex-
isting evidence; despite the 2017 update identifying a further 45
studies for the review, no high-quality evidence exists of effective
interventions to increase the fruit and vegetable consumption of
children. Thirdly, we are aware of multiple ongoing trials in this
area of research that will be important to incorporate, and we ex-
pect that future research will have impact on the conclusions.

Criteria for considering studies for this review
Types of studies
Eligible trials were randomised controlled trials (RCTs), includ-
ing cluster-randomised controlled trials (C-RCTs) and cross-over
trials, that:
1. Compared two or more alternative intervention programmes to
increase the consumption of fruit or vegetables or both of children
aged five years and under;
2. Compared an intervention programme to increase the con-
sumption of fruit or vegetables or both of children aged five years
and under with a standard-care or no-intervention control group.

Interventions for increasing fruit and vegetable consumption in children aged five years and under (Review)
Copyright © 2017 The Cochrane Collaboration. Published by John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.
 We excluded trials which did not include fruit or vegetable intake
as a primary trial outcome, to avoid the potential confounding ef-
fectsof otherinterventions,andbecause publication bias and selec-
tive outcome reporting are more predominant among secondary
trial outcomes (or outcomes that were not otherwise stated). We
included trials that did not state a primary trial outcome but did
assess an eligible fruit or vegetable intake outcome. We included
eligible cross-over trials in the review, as we deemed them a suit-
able and common method for assessing the effect of interventions
to increase the fruit and vegetable consumption of children.
Types of participants
Participants could include:
1. Children aged five years and under. Trials including children
older than five years were included only if the mean age of the
study sample at baseline was five years or less;
2. Parents, guardians and families responsible for the care of chil-
dren aged five years and under;
3. Professionals responsible for the care of children aged five years
and under, including childcare staff and health professionals.
Types of interventions
We considered any educational, experiential, health promotion
and/or psychological or family or behavioural therapy or coun-
selling or management or structural or policy or legislative reform
interventions, designed to increase consumption of fruit or veg-
etables or both in children aged five years and under (as defined
in types of participants). Interventions could be conducted in any
setting including the home, childcare/preschool services, health
services, or community settings.
Comparison: Any alternative intervention to encourage fruit and
vegetable consumption as described above, or a no-intervention
control, usual care, or attention control or wait-list control. At-
tention controls in randomised trials for behavioural interventions
are those that include clinical attention and induce the expecta-
tion of therapeutic benefit for control for non-specific effects of
the intervention (Freedland 2011). Wait-list control groups that
are also designed to control for non-specific effects involve partic-
ipants being allocated to receive an intervention at study conclu-
sion (delayed start) (Whitehead 2004).
Types of outcome measures
We include studieswith evaluatedoutcomesmeasuringbiomedical
or dietary indices or both.
Primary outcomes
The primary outcome was children’s fruit and vegetable intake.
Fruit and vegetable intake could be assessed using a variety of
measures, including:
1. Change in the number of portions or serves of daily fruit or
vegetable or both at follow-up, as measured by diet recalls, food
diaries, food frequency questionnaires or diet records completed
by an adult on behalf of the child. We grouped the interventions
by short-term effects (less than 12 months post-intervention)
and long-term effects (at least 12 months post-intervention);
2. Change in grams of fruit or vegetables or both at follow-up,
as measured by diet recalls, food diaries, food frequency
questionnaires or diet records completed by an adult on behalf of
the child. We grouped them by short-term effects (less than 12
months post-intervention) and long-term effects (at least 12
months post-intervention);
3. Changes in biomedical markers of consumption of fruit or
vegetables or both, such as α-carotene, β-carotene,
cryptoxanthin, lycopene and lutein. We grouped them by short-
term effects (less than 12 months post-intervention) and long-
term effects (12 months or more post-intervention).
Outcomes of fruit or vegetable juice intake alone were not eligible.
Outcomes that included child fruit and vegetable juice intake as
part of an aggregate measure of child fruit or vegetable intake were
eligible.
Secondary outcomes
1. Estimates of absolute costs and cost effectiveness of
interventions to increase the consumption of fruits and
vegetables reported in identified studies.
2. Any reported adverse effects of an intervention to increase
the consumption of fruits and vegetables reported in identified
studies. This could include any physical, behavioural,
psychological or financial impact on the child, parent or family,
or the service or facility where an intervention may have been
implemented.
Search methods for identification of studies
This review represents the first update of a previously published
review (Wolfenden 2012).
Electronic searches
We conducted a search of the following electronic databases:
• Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials
(CENTRAL) Issue 8, 2016 in the Cochrane Library (searched
30 September 2016);
• Epub Ahead of Print, In-Process & Other Non-Indexed
Citations, MEDLINE Daily and MEDLINE (Ovid, 1946 to 30
September 2016) (searched 30 September 2016);
• Embase Classic and Embase (Ovid, 1947 to 2016 week 39)
(searched 30 September 2016);
• CINAHL (EBSCO, 1937 to 5 July 2016) (searched 5 July
2016);

 • PsycINFO (Ovid,1806 to June week 5 2016) (searched 5
July 2016).
The search strategies are described in Appendix 2. We applied
the sensitivity-maximising version of the Cochrane RCT filter (
Lefebvre 2011) to MEDLINE, and adaptations of it to the other
databases except for CENTRAL. We imposed no restrictions by
date or language of publication.
As a living systematic review we will run the following electronic
database searches monthly:
• CENTRAL
• Epub Ahead of Print, In-Process & Other Non-Indexed
Citations, MEDLINE Daily and MEDLINE
• Embase
We will set up auto-alerts (where possible) to deliver a monthly
search yield by email.
We will review search methods and strategies approximately yearly,
to ensure they reflect any terminology changes in the topic area,
or in the databases.
Searching other resources
We searched the reference lists of included articles and hand-
searched all articles published between 2006 and September 2016
in three relevant international peer-reviewed journals (Journal of
Nutrition Education and Behavior, Public Health Nutrition, and
Journal of the Academy of Nutrition and Dietetics (previously titled
Journal of the American Dietetic Association)).
We searched the metaRegister of clinical trials (www.controlled-
trials.com/mrct/) and the WHO International Clinical Trials Reg-
istry Platform ( www.who.int/ictrp/) in November 2016, and
www.clinicaltrials.gov on 14 June 2017. We searched a database
of published dissertations, Proquest Dissertations and Theses, in
November 2016, to identify eligible studies. We conducted a ’grey
literature’ search in GoogleScholar on 14 June 2017, of which
we screened the first 200 citations for eligibility. We contacted
the authors of included studies to try to obtain other eligible tri-
als published in peer-reviewed journals, as well as ongoing trials.
We describe ongoing studies, where available, detailing the pri-
mary author, research question(s), methods and outcome measures
(Characteristics of ongoing studies).
We are now running monthly trial registry searches of WHO In-
ternational Clinical Trials Registry Platform and clinicaltrials.gov.
We will set up auto-alerts (where possible) to deliver a monthly
search yield by email.
We will conduct selected searches of other resources (articles pub-
lished in three relevant international peer-reviewed journals: Jour-
nal of Nutrition Education and Behavior, Public Health Nutrition,
and Journal of the Academy of Nutrition and Dietetics; database
of published dissertations; and ’grey literature’ in GoogleScholar)
manually every six months.
As additional steps to inform the living systematic review, we will
contact corresponding authors of ongoing studies as they are iden-
tified and ask them to advise when results are available, or to share
early or unpublished data. We will contact the corresponding au-
thors of any newly-included studies for advice as to other relevant
studies. We will conduct citation tracking of included studies in
Web of Science Core Collection on an ongoing basis. For that pur-
pose, we have set up citation alerts in Web of Science Core Col-
lection. We will manually screen the reference lists of any newly-
included studies and systematic reviews. Also, we will use the ’Re-
lated citation’ feature in PubMed to identify additional articles.
We will review search methods and strategies approximately yearly,
to ensure they reflect any terminology changes in the topic area,
or in the databases.
Data collection and analysis
Selection of studies
Pairs of review authors (from RH, RW, FS, SY, NN) indepen-
dently screened titles and abstracts of identified papers. Review
authors were not blinded to the details of the study author or jour-
nal. Review authors applied a standardised screening tool to assess
eligibility. Articles were screened against the eligibility criteria of
participants (mean age of children more than five years), outcome
(primary outcome was not fruit and vegetable intake), comparator
(was not a no-intervention, usual care, attention or wait-list con-
trol), intervention (did not aim to increase child fruit or vegetable
intake) and study type (was not RCT, C-RCT or cross-over trial
with random allocation to group). Based on the title and abstract,
we excluded papers which clearly did not meet the eligibility crite-
ria of the review. Pairs of review authors (from FS, RH, NN, RS,
SY) then independently examined the full text of all remaining
articles. We documented Information regarding the reason for the
ineligibility of any paper for which we reviewed the full text, and
present it in the table ’Characteristics of excluded studies’. A third
review author with expertise in review methodology (LW) resolved
any disagreements between review authors on study eligibility. For
those papers which did not provide sufficient information to de-
termine eligibility, we contacted the study authors for clarification.
We will immediately screen any new citations retrieved by the
monthly searches. As the first step of monthly screening, we
will apply the machine learning classifier (RCT model) (Wallace
2017), available in the Cochrane Register of Studies (CRS-Web)
(Cochrane 2017a). The classifier assigns a probability (from 0 to
100) to each citation of being a true RCT. For citations that are
assigned a probability score of less than 10, the machine learn-
ing classifier currently has a specificity/recall of 99.987% (Wallace
2017). We will screen in duplicate and independently all citations
assigned a score from 10 to 100 . Citations that score 9 or less will
be screened by Cochrane Crowd (Cochrane 2017b). Any citations
that are deemed to be potential RCTs by Cochrane Crowd will be
returned to the authors for screening.

 Data extraction and management
Pairs of review authors (from EJ, RW, RH, KB, KO, ER, TCM,
RS) independently extracted data from each included trial. Re-
view authors were not blinded to the details of the study author
or journal. We recorded data on data extraction forms designed
and piloted specifically for this review. Consultation with a third
review author with expertise in review methodology (LW) resolved
discrepancies between review authors about data extraction. We
tried to contact authors of included papers in instances where the
information required for data extraction was not available from
the published report, or was unclear. One review author entered
extracted data into the systematic review software Review Manager
5 (RevMan) (RH) and another review author checked it (KO).
Where available, we extracted the following information from in-
cluded trials:
1. Information on the study, research design and methods, such
as the study authors; date of publication; date of study initiation;
study duration; setting; number of participants; participants’ age,
gender, ethnicity, and socioeconomic position.
2. Information on the experimental conditions of the trial, such
as the number of experimental conditions; intervention and com-
parator components; duration; number of contacts; modalities;
interventionist; and integrity.
3. Information on the trial outcomes and results, such as rates of
recruitment and attrition; sample size; number of participants per
experimental condition; mean and standard deviation of the pri-
mary or secondary outcomes described above; any subgroup anal-
yses by gender, population group or intervention characteristics;
and analyses (including whether studies appropriately adjusted for
clustering).
Assessment of risk of bias in included studies
Two review authors (FS and FT) independently assessed the risks
of bias in the included studies. We consulted a third review au-
thor (RH) with expertise in review methodology to resolve any
disagreements between review authors. Review authors used the
tool outlined in the Cochrane Handbook for Systematic Reviews of
Interventions (Higgins 2011) to assess the risks of bias. The tool
requires an explicit judgement by the review authors, based on trial
information, about the risks of bias attributable to the generation
of the random sequence, the allocation concealment, the blinding
of participants, personnel and outcome assessors, the complete-
ness of outcome data, selective reporting, and any other potential
threats to validity. We also judged recruitment bias, baseline im-
balance, loss of clusters and incorrect analysis for C-RCTs. Judge-
ments on the risks of bias for each trial are recorded in the ‘Risk
of bias’ tables accompanying the review.
Measures of treatment effect
Where meta-analyses were performed, we expressed the interven-
tion effect as a mean difference (MD) where outcomes were re-
ported using a standard metric (such as grams), and as a standard-
ised mean difference (SMD) where outcomes were reported using
different methods or metrics of fruit and vegetable intake (such as
grams, grams per kilogram of body weight, and serves per day).
Unit of analysis issues
We assessed cluster-randomised trials in the review for unit-of-
analysis errors. Where cluster-randomised studies did not account
for clustering, we contacted study authors to provide intra-class
correlation coefficients (ICCs) to allow calculation of design ef-
fects and effective sample sizes to enable individual-level pooling.
Where ICCs were not available, we estimated a mean ICC from
reported ICCs of included studies, and used it to calculate effec-
tive sample sizes.
Dealing with missing data
Where available, we reported outcomes of trials using an inten-
tion-to-treat analysis. If studies did not report intention-to-treat
analyses, we reported as-treated analysis of trial outcomes. We ex-
plored the impact of including as-treated trial outcomes in meta-
analysis for studies with a high rate of attrition (more than 20% for
short-term outcomes) in sensitivity analyses (see below Sensitivity
analysis). We contacted study authors to obtain any missing data
(e.g. standard deviations).
Assessment of heterogeneity
We assessed statistical heterogeneity by visual inspection of forest
plots of the included trials, and calculation of the I2 statistic where
data from included trials could be pooled. Subgroup analyses by
trial characteristics (e.g. type of participants, intervention or out-
comes) to identify the source of substantial heterogeneity (defined
as I2 greater than 50%) was not able to be conducted due to the
similarity in trial characteristics.
Assessment of reporting biases
We checked for reporting bias by visual inspection of the funnel
plots.
Data synthesis
We assessed trial outcomes using a variety of dietary assessment
tools and reported in various metrics, including vitamin C from
fruit, fruit or vegetable serves, and grams of fruit and/or veg-
etable consumption. We calculated standardised mean differences
(SMDs; to account for variable outcome measures) for each com-
parison, using the generic inverse variance method in a fixed-ef-
fect meta-analysis model (where there was no or low statistical
heterogeneity in the primary analysis) or a random-effects meta-
analysis model (where there was unexplained heterogeneity in the
primary analysis), using the RevMan software. We selected post-

 intervention values over change-from-baseline data for inclusion
in meta-analysis, to reduce the risk of selective reporting and to
maximise the number of studies that could be pooled.
We synthesised studies that provided data suitable for pooling in
meta-analysesgroupedbyinterventiontype (infantfeeding, parent
nutrition education, and multicomponent interventions). When
studies reported multiple fruit or vegetable outcomes, we selected
the statedprimarytrial outcome forinclusioninourmeta-analyses,
or if a primary outcome was not stated we selected the first reported
outcome forinclusion. Forstudieswhich reportedmultiple follow-
up points, we extracted data from the longest follow-up period for
inclusion in meta-analyses.
We selected reported study estimates that adjusted for potential
confounding variables for inclusion in meta-analysis over reported
estimates that did not adjust for potential confounding variables.
Similarly, for C-RCTs that reported study estimates that were
unadjusted and adjusted for clustering, we preferred estimates
that adjusted for clustering for inclusion in meta-analyses. For C-
RCTs that did not report post-intervention study estimates (and
a relevant measure of variance) that accounted for clustering, we
calculated a design effect and effective sample size using study
data (number of clusters, number of participants analysed) and
a reported ICC from one of the included studies (vegetable in-
take: ICC 0.014, fruit intake: ICC 0.016; De Bock 2012). For
such C-RCTs (De Coen 2012; Martinez-Andrade 2014; Namenek
Brouwer 2013; Nicklas 2017; O’Connell 2012; Roset-Salla 2016;
Verbestel 2014; Williams 2014), we entered the reported post-in-
tervention outcome data (e.g. mean and standard deviation) and
author-calculated effective sample sizes into Revman to calculate
individual-level adjusted study estimates to enable inclusion in
meta-analyses. We tried to pool studies separately that compared
two or more alternative interventions.
For cross-over trials, we tried to synthesise results separately from
parallel RCTs, by pooling results from paired analyses that adjust
for within-individual comparisons. If such data were not available,
we combined results by pooling data from the first cross-over pe-
riod (i.e. essentially a parallel RCT) with parallel RCTs.
In all instances where we could not combine data in a meta-anal-
ysis, we have provided a narrative summary of the trial findings
according to the review objectives.
Whenever we find new evidence (i.e. studies, data or information)
meeting the review inclusion criteria, we will extract the data,
assess risks of bias and incorporate it into the synthesis every three
months, as appropriate.
We will incorporate any new study data into existing meta-analy-
ses using the standard approaches outlined in the Data synthesis
section.
We will not adjust the meta-analyses to account for multiple test-
ing, given that the methods related to frequent updating of meta-
analyses are under development (Simmonds (in press)).
Summary of Findings table and GRADE
We created ’Summary of findings’ tables using the following out-
comes:
1. Child fruit and vegetable intake. This could include changes
in the number of portions or serves or grams of daily fruit or
vegetable or both at follow-up, as measured by diet recalls, food
diaries, food frequency questionnaires or diet records completed
by an adult on behalf of the child; or changes in biomedical
markers of consumption of fruit or vegetables or both, such as α-
carotene, β-carotene, cryptoxanthin, lycopene and lutein.
2. Estimates of absolute costs and cost effectiveness of
interventions to increase the consumption of fruit and vegetables
reported in the included studies;
3. Any reported adverse events of an intervention to increase
the consumption of fruit and vegetables reported in the included
studies. This could include any physical, behavioural,
psychological or financial impact on the child, parent or family,
or the service or facility where an intervention may have been
implemented.
We have produced four ’Summary of findings’ tables, one for each
of the following comparisons:
1. Child-feeding interventions compared to no-intervention
control;
2. Parent nutrition education interventions compared to no-
intervention control;
3. Multicomponent interventions compared to no-
intervention control;
4. Child nutrition education interventions compared to no-
intervention control.
We used the five GRADE considerations (study limitations, con-
sistency of effect, imprecision, indirectness and publication bias)
to assess the quality of a body of evidence as it relates to the studies
which contribute data to the meta-analyses for the prespecified
outcomes. We used methods and recommendations described in
Section 8.5 and Chapter 12 of the Cochrane Handbook for System-
atic Reviews of Interventions ( Higgins 2011), using GRADEpro
software ( gradepro.org/). We justified all decisions to downgrade
the quality of studies using footnotes, and made comments to aid
the reader’s understanding of the review where necessary. For each
comparison where we had calculated a SMD, we re-expressed it
based on the instrument used in the lowest risk of bias in that
comparison (e.g. grams of vegetable intake or serves of vegetables
a day), by multiplying the post-intervention standard deviation of
the control group by the pooled SMD.
Tworeviewauthors(RHandNN),workingindependently, judged
the quality of the evidence, with disagreements resolved by dis-
cussion or by involving a third review author (LW). We justified,
documented and incorporated the judgements into the reporting
of results for each outcome.
We extracted study data, formatted our comparisons in data tables
and prepared a ’Summary of findings’ table before writing the
results and conclusions of our review.

 Subgroup analysis and investigation of heterogeneity
Where possible, we conducted subgroup analyses of interventions
for the following subgroups, which we had planned a priori:
1. Interventions targeting boys and girls (not conducted);
2. Interventions targeting minority groups including
indigenous populations (not conducted, described narratively);
3. Interventions delivered in various settings including health
and children’s services (conducted where possible for some
comparisons and settings);
4. Interventions of varying intensities, defined in terms of the
number and duration of intervention contacts or components
(not conducted);
5. Interventions delivered in different modes, such as by
telephone, the Internet or face-to-face (conducted for some
comparisons and modalities, otherwise described narratively).
Sensitivity analysis
Where possible, we conducted sensitivity analyses to explore the
impact on the overall assessment of treatment effects:
1. Excluding studies at high risk of bias (defined a priori);
2. Excluding studies not reporting an intention-to-treat
analysis, with high rates of participant attrition defined as greater
than 20% (defined a priori);
3. Excluding studies that did not have a primary outcome of
child fruit and vegetable consumption (post hoc).
For the sensitivity analysis excluding studies that did not have a
primary outcome of child fruit and vegetable consumption, we
considered studies to have a primary outcome of children’s fruit
and vegetable intake even when this was not explicitly stated if:
children’s fruit and vegetable intake was the only reported out-
come, a sample size calculation for children’s fruit and vegetable
intake was reported, or children’s fruit and vegetable intake was
the first reported outcome.
Other
We will review our scope and methods if appropriate in the light
of potential changes in the topic area, or the evidence being in-
cluded in the review (e.g. additional comparisons, interventions
or outcomes, or new review methods available).
We are piloting this review as a living systematic review up until
March 2018.

Results of the search
We ran searches for the original review (Wolfenden 2012) and
for the review update, which together generated 22,953 citations
(10,720 original review; 12,233 review update). Screening of titles
and abstracts from the review update identified 414 papers (558 in
total, including 144 from original review) for formal inclusion or
exclusion. (See Figure 1). Of these, 50 trials (Anzman-Frasca 2012;

 Included studies
There were 137 trial arms and 10,267 participants randomised
across the 50 included trials. We give full details of the trials in the
Characteristics of included studies table. Twenty-two trials were
undertaken in the USA, eight in the United Kingdom, five each
in Australia and the Netherlands, three in Belgium, and one each
in Turkey, Germany, Denmark, Mexico, France and Spain, and
one study that was undertaken in the United Kingdom, Greece
and Portugal. Twenty-three of the included studies were RCTs,
of which 14 compared an intervention to a no-treatment control
group; 18 were C-RCTs, of which 15 compared an intervention
to a no-treatment control group; and nine were cross-over trials.
The unit of randomisation in C-RCTs included childcare centres
or preschools (n = 12), parent groups (n = 2), preschool classrooms
(n = 1), primary schools (n = 1), primary school classrooms (n = 1),
and primary care clinics (n = 1). Twenty-six trials were conducted
in a preschool or school setting; 11 in a home setting; five in a
health setting (e.g. primary care); two in a laboratory setting; three
in a home and laboratory setting; two in a preschool and home
setting; and one in a home and health setting. Included studies
examined the impact of various types of interventions to increase
child fruit and vegetable consumption. Forty-seven of the included
studies assessed intake of vegetables, and 25 assessed intake of fruit.
Various objective and subjective measures were used to assess fruit
and vegetable intake, such as ad libitum intake and mean daily
intake as reported by parents. Information on the reliability and
validity of selected fruit and vegetable intake outcome measures
were reported by 10 studies. Post-intervention follow-up periods
ranged from immediate to 3½ years. Of the 50 included studies,
11 did not report whether funding support was received to un-
dertake the trial, one study reported no funding support (Baskale
2011), and the remaining 38 studies reported a source of funding.
Funding support for such studies were governmental or charitable,
with the exception of two studies that reported receiving funding
from food industry sources (Fisher 2012; Tabak 2012).
Thirty trials tested the impact of specific feeding-practice inter-
ventions (e.g. repeated exposure) in increasing children’s intake of
fruits or vegetables (Anzman-Frasca 2012; Barends 2013; Blissett
2016; Caton 2013; Cooke 2011; Correia 2014; Cravener 2015;
Daniels 2014; De Droog 2014; De Wild 2013; De Wild 2015a;
De Wild 2015b; Fildes 2014; Fildes 2015; Fisher 2012; Harnack
2012; Hausner 2012; Hetherington 2015; Keller 2012; Menella
2008; O’Connell 2012; Remington 2012; Remy 2013; Roe 2013;
Savage 2012; Spill 2010; Spill 2011a; Spill 2011b; Staiano 2016;
Wardle 2003a). Of the trials testing the impact of specific feed-
ing-practice interventions, 18 compared the effectiveness of two
or more interventions and 12 trials compared one or more inter-
ventions with a no-treatment control group; nine of these were
cross-over trials. Thirteen trials examined the effect of repeated ex-
posure compared to alternative interventions, of which five com-
pared the effect of a repeated exposure intervention to one or
more alternative interventions (including associative condition-
ing, flavour-flavour learning, flavour-nutrient learning, choice of
vegetable versus no choice) (Anzman-Frasca 2012; Barends 2013;
Caton 2013; Hausner 2012; Remy 2013), one compared the ef-
fect of repeated exposure choice offering of vegetable to no choice
(De Wild 2015a), and one study compared the effect of repeated
exposures and variety (Menella 2008). The other five trials ex-
amined the effect of a repeated exposure intervention compared
to no-treatment control, of which one trial each examined the
effect of repeated exposure alone (O’Connell 2012), taste expo-
sure plus rewards (Fildes 2014), exposure plus social reward and
exposure plus tangible reward (Remington 2012), exposure and
nutrition information (Wardle 2003a), and exposure plus tangible
reward, exposure plus social reward and exposure alone (Cooke
2011). Two trials examined the effect of flavour nutrient learning,
of which one trial compared the effects of low-energy vegetable
soup versus high-energy vegetable soup (De Wild 2013), and the
other trial compared incorporation of vegetable puree into meals
at three different levels of energy density (Spill 2011a). Four tri-
als examined the effect of parent feeding interventions, one trial
compared the effects of advice to the parent about introducing
vegetables to no-treatment control (Fildes 2015), one trial com-
pared the effects of an early feeding intervention targeting com-
plementary feeding practices to a no-treatment control (Daniels
2014), one trial compared the effects of early and repeated expo-
sure to vegetables during complementary feeding to a no-treat-
ment control (Hetherington 2015), and the other trial compared
parent prompting and modelling, parent prompting alone and
modelling alone (Blissett 2016). Four trials examined the effect of
pairing fruit and vegetables with positive stimuli; one trial com-
pared pairing vegetables with stimuli such as stickers and cartoon
packaging to a no-treatment control (Cravener 2015), one trial
compared pairing fruit and vegetables with character branding to
a no-treatment control (Keller 2012), one trial compared pairing
of vegetable with a modelling DVD to a non-food DVD and a no-
DVD control group (Staiano 2016), and the fourth trial compared
the effect of pairing passive and interactive story-telling (about a
character that eats carrots) featuring either a product-congruent (a
rabbit) or product-incongruent (a turtle) character across four ex-
perimental groups compared to a control group (De Droog 2014).
Three trials examined the effect of pairing target vegetables with
liked foods (Correia 2014; De Wild 2015b; Fisher 2012). Two tri-
als examined the effect of varying serving sizes (Savage 2012; Spill
2011b). The remaining three trials examined the effect of different
serving methods; one trial compared serving fruit and vegetables
first before other menu items to a specific plate of prepared food

 (Harnack 2012), one trial compared three different portion sizes
of vegetables served at the beginning of a meal to a control meal
(Spill 2010), and the third trial of eight arms compared the impact
of a single type of vegetable, a variety of vegetables, a single type
of fruit, and a variety of fruits on consumption (Roe 2013).
Eleven studies tested the impact of parent nutrition education
interventions in increasing children’s intake of fruit or vegeta-
bles (Black 2011; Campbell 2013; Duncanson 2013; Haire-Joshu
2008; Martinez-Andrade 2014; Roset-Salla 2016; Skouteris 2015;
Tabak 2012; Verbestel 2014; Watt 2009; Wyse 2012). Four tri-
als were conducted in a health setting: one trial compared a par-
enting practices intervention to a maternal diet and physical ac-
tivity intervention to control (Black 2011), one trial compared a
dietitian-delivered intervention in a first-time parents’ group re-
garding infant feeding, physical activity and sedentary behaviours
to control (Campbell 2013), one trial compared a six-week par-
ent intervention on obesity awareness and prevention to control
(Martinez-Andrade 2014), and the fourth trial compared a mul-
tistrategy parent intervention including health snack exposure to
control (Skouteris 2015). Four trials were conducted within a
home setting: one trial compared the provision of an interactive
nutrition education CD and parenting DVD to parents to wait-
list control (Duncanson 2013), one trial compared a parent inter-
vention inclusive of a tailored newsletter, home visits and materi-
als to usual care (Haire-Joshu 2008), one trial compared a dieti-
tian-delivered parent intervention on vegetable availability, picky
eating, modelling and family meals to control (Tabak 2012); and
the fourth compared a parent intervention on infant-feeding prac-
tices to usual care (Watt 2009). Three trials were conducted in
a preschool setting; one trial compared a parent education in-
tervention on dietary knowledge and changing habits to control
(Roset-Salla 2016), one trial compared a parent intervention in-
cluding a poster with guidelines and tips, and tailored feedback
aboutchilddietarybehavioursversuscontrol (Verbestel 2014), and
the third trial compared a parent intervention including a resource
kit and telephone calls to improve parent knowledge and skills
about the home food environment versus control (Wyse 2012).
Eight studies tested the impact of multicomponent interventions
(e.g. teacher and parent education, preschool policy changes) in
increasing children’s intake of fruit or vegetables (De Bock 2012;
De Coen 2012; Namenek Brouwer 2013; Natale 2014a; Nicklas
2017; Vereecken 2009; Williams 2014; Witt 2012). Four trials
were conducted in a preschool setting; one trial compared an in-
tervention combining familiarisation, preparation and cooking of
meals with children, teachers and parents and parent education re-
garding modelling and nutrition needs of children to control (De
Bock 2012); one trial compared a garden-based intervention and
curriculum materials about targeted fruits or vegetables to control
(Namenek Brouwer 2013); one trial compared a teacher curricu-
lum, parent curriculum, and preschool policy intervention to con-
trol (Natale 2014a); and the fourth trial compared a nutrition ed-
ucation targeting children, parents and preschool staff to control
(Williams 2014). Two trials were conducted in a school setting;
one trial compared a community, school and parent intervention
for nutrition and physical activity health targets to control (De
Coen 2012); and the other trial compared a preschool environ-
ment, child, parent and teacher intervention to control (Vereecken
2009). One trial, conducted in both a school and a home setting,
compared an interactive education intervention about physical ac-
tivity and healthful eating inclusive of teacher guides and parent
newsletters to control (Witt 2012). An additional trial, conducted
in both a preschool and a home setting, compared a motivational
theatre intervention which included the screening of four DVDs
of a puppet show aimed at persuading children to increase veg-
etable consumption, and provision of resources to parents includ-
ing ingredients for a vegetable snack, to a no-intervention control
(Nicklas 2017).
One study tested the impact of an intervention involving the de-
livery of nutrition education to children within nursery classrooms
in increasing child fruit and vegetable intake (Baskale 2011).
Excluded studies
Following an assessment of study titles and abstracts, the full texts
of 414 articles in the update were sought for further review for
study eligibility (558 in total, when combined with 144 from the
original review) (Figure 1). The full texts of 413 articles were able
to be located (535 in total, when combined with 122 from the
original review). We considered 329 studies to be ineligible for
the review update following the trial screening process (reasons
for exclusion included participants n = 127; outcomes n = 121;
comparator n = 19; intervention n = 15; study design n = 47). See
Characteristics of excluded studies for further details.
Studies awaiting classification
We could not determine the eligibility of one trial, as no full text
was available. See Characteristics of studies awaiting classification.
Ongoing studies
We identified five ongoing trials with a published protocol
(Characteristics of ongoing studies), for which neither published
nor unpublished data were available. These include a C-RCT
(Belanger 2016) testing the effect of a multicomponent interven-
tion involving community partnerships and healthy eating train-
ing for staff in early childcare centres compared to a no-interven-
tion control; a RCT (Horodynski 2011) testing the effect of a
child-feedinginterventionfocusedonmaternal self-efficacyduring
feeding and appropriate feeding styles compared to usual care; a C-
RCT (Østbye 2015) testing the effect of a multicomponent home
and childcare intervention compared to a no-intervention con-
trol; a RCT (Sobko 2016) testing the effect of a multicomponent
healthy lifestyle programme delivered to parent-child dyads com-
pared to a wait list or a no-intervention control; and a RCT(Watt

 2014) testing the effect of a multicomponent intervention involv-
ing parents and childcare staff compared to a no-intervention con-
trol.

 Random sequence generation
We rated 16 of the 50 studies at low risk of bias for random
sequence generation, with all random-number sequences created
using various computer-based software (Campbell 2013; Cooke
2011; Cravener 2015; Daniels 2014; Duncanson 2013; Fildes
2015; Haire-Joshu 2008; Martinez-Andrade 2014; Namenek
Brouwer 2013; Roe 2013; Skouteris 2015; Spill 2011a; Staiano
2016; Vereecken 2009; Watt 2009; Wyse 2012). The method
of sequence generation in the remaining 34 studies was unclear
(Anzman-Frasca 2012; Barends 2013; Baskale 2011; Black 2011;
Blissett2016; Caton 2013; Correia 2014; De Bock 2012; De Coen
2012; De Droog 2014; De Wild 2013; De Wild 2015a; De Wild
2015b; Fildes 2014; Fisher 2012; Harnack 2012; Hausner 2012;
Hetherington 2015; Keller 2012; Menella 2008; Natale 2014a;
Nicklas 2017; O’Connell 2012; Remington 2012; Remy 2013;
Roset-Salla 2016; Savage 2012; Spill 2010; Spill 2011b; Tabak
2012; Verbestel 2014; Wardle 2003a; Williams 2014; Witt 2012).
Allocation
Only four of the 50 studies reported that participant allocation to
the experimental group was concealed from those conducting the
research (De Bock 2012; Duncanson 2013; Wardle 2003a; Watt
2009). We judged one study to have a high risk of selection bias (
Haire-Joshu 2008), as educators were aware of site allocation when
they were enrolling participants to the trial. The remaining 45
studies had an unclear risk of selection bias (Anzman-Frasca 2012;
Barends 2013; Baskale 2011; Black 2011; Blissett 2016; Campbell
2013; Caton 2013; Cooke 2011; Correia 2014; Cravener 2015;
Daniels 2014; De Coen 2012; De Droog 2014; De Wild 2013;
De Wild 2015a; De Wild 2015b; Fildes 2014; Fildes 2015; Fisher
2012; Harnack 2012; Hausner 2012; Hetherington 2015 Keller
2012; Martinez-Andrade 2014; Menella2008; NamenekBrouwer
2013; Natale 2014a; Nicklas 2017; O’Connell 2012; Remington
2012; Remy 2013; Roe 2013; Roset-Salla 2016; Savage 2012;
Skouteris 2015; Spill 2010; Spill 2011a; Spill 2011b; Staiano
2016; Tabak 2012; Verbestel 2014; Vereecken 2009; Williams
2014; Witt 2012; Wyse 2012).
Blinding
Performance bias
In 22 of the studies, we judged the potential for trial outcomes to
be influenced by participants or personnel delivering the interven-
tion to be high, due to the lack of blinding and the method used
for outcome assessment (e.g. self-report) (Anzman-Frasca 2012;
Barends 2013; Baskale 2011; Black 2011; Campbell 2013; Daniels
2014; De Bock 2012; De Coen 2012; Fildes 2014; Fildes 2015;
Haire-Joshu 2008; Hetherington 2015; Martinez-Andrade 2014;
Natale 2014a; Roset-Salla 2016; Skouteris 2015; Tabak 2012;
Verbestel 2014; Vereecken2009; Watt 2009; Williams 2014; Wyse
2012).We rated 22 studies at low risk of performance bias, due to
blinding or the use of objective outcome assessments which were
unlikely to be influenced by awareness of group allocation (e.g.
weighing food on electronic scales) (Blissett 2016; Caton 2013;
Cooke 2011; Correia 2014; Cravener 2015; De Droog 2014; De
Wild 2013; De Wild 2015a; De Wild 2015b; Duncanson 2013;
Fisher 2012; Hausner 2012; Keller 2012; Namenek Brouwer
2013; O’Connell 2012; Remy 2013; Roe 2013; Savage 2012; Spill
2011a; Spill 2011b; Wardle 2003a; Witt 2012). For the six re-
maining studies the risk of performance bias was unclear (Harnack
2012; Menella 2008; Nicklas 2017; Remington 2012; Spill 2010;
Staiano 2016).
Detection bias
We rated 18 studies at high risk of detection bias, due to partic-
ipants or assessors not being blind to group allocation and the
use of self-report measures (Baskale 2011; Black 2011; Campbell
2013; Daniels 2014; De Bock 2012; De Coen 2012; Fildes
2014; Martinez-Andrade 2014; Namenek Brouwer 2013; Natale
2014a; Roset-Salla 2016; Skouteris 2015; Spill 2010; Tabak 2012;
Verbestel 2014; Vereecken 2009; Williams 2014; Wyse 2012).
Blinding of assessors, or the objective measurement of child
fruit and vegetable intake which is unlikely to be impacted by
lack of blinding (e.g. the food was weighed or counted), meant
that 24 studies had a low risk of detection bias (Anzman-Frasca
2012; Blissett 2016; Caton 2013; Cooke 2011; Correia 2014; De
Droog 2014; De Wild 2013; De Wild 2015a; De Wild 2015b;
Duncanson 2013; Fisher 2012; Haire-Joshu 2008; Hausner 2012;
Keller2012; Menella 2008; Nicklas 2017; O’Connell 2012; Remy
2013; Savage 2012; Spill 2011a; Spill 2011b; Wardle 2003a; Watt
2009; Witt 2012). The remaining eight studies had an unclear
risk of detection bias (Barends 2013; Cravener 2015; Fildes 2015;
Harnack 2012; Hetherington 2015; Remington 2012; Roe 2013;
Staiano 2016).
Incomplete outcome data
Seven studies reported no attrition, and therefore had a very low
risk of bias (Anzman-Frasca 2012; Cravener 2015; Nicklas 2017;
O’Connell 2012; Savage 2012; Spill 2010; Staiano 2016). A fur-
ther 15 studies reported a low loss of participants (usually less
than 10%) and similar losses across arms for cohort studies, or
otherwise used a cross-sectional, pre-post design and were also
considered to be at low risk (Barends 2013; Cooke 2011; De
Wild2015a; Fildes2015; Fisher2012; Haire-Joshu2008; Hausner
2012; Hetherington 2015; Namenek Brouwer 2013; Roe 2013;
Skouteris 2015; Spill 2011b; Tabak 2012; Wardle 2003a; Wyse
2012). Twenty-three studies had a high risk of bias due to high

Five studies had an unclear risk of attrition bias (Black 2011;
Campbell 2013; De Droog 2014; Remington 2012; Vereecken
2009).
Selective reporting
Most studies had an unclear risk of selective reporting (Anzman-
Frasca 2012; Barends 2013; Baskale 2011; Black 2011; Blissett
2016; Caton 2013; Cooke 2011; Correia 2014; Cravener 2015;

2014; Vereecken 2009; Wardle 2003a; Williams 2014; Witt
2012). We judged one trial (Campbell 2013) to be at high risk of
biasdue tooutcomesreferredtointhe protocol notbeing reported.
The remaining 11 studies reported all expected outcomes (Daniels
2014; De Wild 2013; Duncanson 2013; Martinez-Andrade 2014;
Namenek Brouwer 2013; Nicklas 2017; Remy 2013; Roe 2013;
Spill 2011a; Watt 2009; Wyse 2012).
Other potential sources of bias
Of the 23 RCTs, ten had a low risk of bias (Anzman-Frasca 2012;
Barends 2013; Caton 2013; Cravener 2015; De Droog 2014;
Fildes 2015; Savage 2012; Skouteris 2015; Wardle 2003a; Watt
2009), eight had an unclear risk of bias (Black 2011; Blissett
2016; Hetherington 2015; Keller 2012; Remington 2012; Remy
2013; Staiano 2016; Tabak 2012) and five had a high risk of bias
(Daniels 2014; De Wild 2015a; Duncanson 2013; Fildes 2014;
Menella 2008) for other potential sources of bias. One trial did
not account for clustering in the analysis, even though the trial
protocol said clustering would be accounted for (Daniels 2014).
Four trials had a high risk of bias, as they reported baseline im-
balances between study groups that were not accounted for in the
analysis (De Wild 2015a; Duncanson 2013; Fildes 2014; Menella
2008). Of the 18 C-RCTs, six had a low risk of bias (Baskale
2011; Campbell 2013; Cooke 2011; Haire-Joshu 2008; Vereecken
2009; Wyse 2012), 10 had unclear risk of bias (De Bock 2012;
Fisher 2012; Hausner 2012; Martinez-Andrade 2014; Namenek
Brouwer 2013; Natale 2014a; Nicklas 2017; Roset-Salla 2016;
Williams2014; Witt 2012)andtwohadhigh riskof bias (De Coen
2012; Verbestel 2014). Both the latter had high risk of bias due
to recruitment bias as communities were randomised first before
schools, childcare centres and participants were invited to partici-
pate (De Coen 2012; Verbestel 2014). Of the nine cross-over trials,
eight had a low risk of bias (Correia 2014; De Wild 2013; De Wild
2015b; Harnack 2012; Roe 2013; Spill 2010; Spill 2011a; Spill
2011b), and one study had high risk of bias (O’Connell 2012),
due to differences in baseline vegetable consumption that were not
adjusted for in the analysis.

Primary outcome: Effectiveness of interventions in increasing
the consumption of fruit and/or vegetables
All the included trials reported the impact of the effectiveness of
the intervention on a measure of children’s fruit or vegetable in-
take. Variability in the measurement and reporting of interven-
tion effects as change from baseline or final value scores precluded
statistical examination of heterogeneity. Nonetheless, examination
of the interventions tested, trial settings and study populations
suggested that the included trials were heterogeneous and we con-
ducted meta-analyses pooling data from trials where we consid-
ered interventions to be similar. Otherwise, we have provided a
narrative synthesis of trial findings.
Child feeding practice interventions
Short-term impact (less than 12 months)
The effects of interventions targeting child-feeding practices were
mixed. Meta-analysis pooling post-intervention data (follow-up
period range: immediate to six months) from trials comparing
child-feeding practices to no treatment (Cooke 2011; Cravener
2015; Daniels 2014; Fildes 2014; Fildes 2015; Hetherington
2015; Keller 2012; O’Connell 2012; Remington 2012; Staiano
2016; Wardle 2003a) revealed an overall positive intervention ef-
fect on vegetable consumption (SMD 0.38, 95% CI 0.15 to 0.61;
n = 1509; 11 studies; I2 = 73%; very low-quality evidence; Analysis
1.1), which was equivalent to a mean difference of 4.03 grams of
vegetables. Results were similar in sensitivity analyses of studies
at low risk of bias (SMD 0.23, 95% CI 0.03 to 0.44; n = 487; 5
studies; I2 = 14%; Analysis 1.2), of studies with a primary aim of
child fruit or vegetable consumption (SMD 0.47, 95% CI 0.19 to
0.76; n = 1228; 9 studies; I2 = 76%; Analysis 1.3.), and of studies
with no or low attrition and studies with high attrition that un-
dertook intention-to-treat analyses (SMD 0.29, 95% CI 0.10 to
0.48; n = 757; 8 studies; I2 = 27%; Analysis 1.4).
One study that compared one or more child-feeding practice in-
19
Interventions for increasing fruit and vegetable consumption in children aged five years and under (Review)

 terventions to a no-treatment control did not report sufficient data
to enable pooling. Harnack 2012 reported a significant increase
in intake of fruit compared to a control group for an intervention
where fruit and vegetables were served prior to a meal.
Eighteen trials compared the effectiveness of two or more child-
feeding interventions that could not be synthesised in meta-anal-
yses due to variability in the compared interventions (Anzman-
Frasca 2012; Barends 2013; Blissett 2016; Caton 2013; Correia
2014; De Droog 2014; De Wild 2013; De Wild 2015a; De Wild
2015b; Fisher 2012; Hausner 2012; Menella 2008; Remy 2013;
Roe 2013; Savage 2012; Spill 2010; Spill 2011a; Spill 2011b).The
interventions compared in these trials varied greatly; six of the 18
trials reported evidence of an increase in fruit or vegetable con-
sumption for one intervention compared to another (De Droog
2014; De Wild 2013; Roe 2013; Spill 2010; Spill 2011a; Spill
2011b).
Long-term impact (12 months or longer)
One study testing the effect of a child-feeding practice interven-
tion reported a long-term effect 3½ years after a complementary
feeding intervention compared to usual care. There was no long-
term effect of the intervention on either fruit or vegetable intake
as measured by 24-hour recall (Daniels 2014).
Parent nutrition education interventions
Short-term impact (less than 12 months)
Interventions targeting parent nutrition education were gener-
ally not effective. Meta-analysis pooling post-intervention data
(follow-up period range: immediate to six months) from tri-
als comparing parent nutrition education interventions to no
treatment (Campbell 2013; Duncanson 2013; Haire-Joshu 2008;
Martinez-Andrade 2014; Roset-Salla 2016; Skouteris 2015; Tabak
2012; Verbestel 2014; Watt 2009; Wyse 2012) revealed no overall
effect on child consumption of fruit and vegetables (SMD 0.11,
95% CI -0.05 to 0.28; n = 3023; 10 studies; I2 = 72%; very low-
quality evidence; Analysis 2.1). Results were similar in sensitivity
analyses of studies with a primary aim of children’s fruit or veg-
etable consumption (SMD 0.03, 95% CI -0.10 to 0.15; n = 2737;
7 studies; I2 = 52%; Analysis 2.2), and of studies with no or low
attrition and studies with high attrition that undertook intention-
to-treat analyses (SMD 0.11, 95% CI -0.02 to 0.24; n = 2463; 6
studies; I2 = 48%; Analysis 2.3). We did not conduct sensitivity
analyses by risk of bias, as we judged all studies to be at high risk
of bias in at least one domain.
One trial could not be pooled in the meta-analysis. Black 2011
found an intervention targeting parent responsivity and behaviour
management to be effective in increasing total fruit intake com-
pared to control.
Long-term impact (12 months or longer)
Four studies reported the long-term impact of a parent nutrition
education intervention (Duncanson 2013; Skouteris 2015; Watt
2009; Wyse 2012). Of these, only one trial reported a significant
long-term effect on children’s fruit and vegetable consumption
(Watt 2009). The trial examining the impact of a parent interven-
tion targeting infant-feeding practice found a short-term effect at
nine months and long-term effect at 15-month follow-up on fruit
and vegetable consumption compared to usual care (Watt 2009).
The other three trials reporting long-term impacts of parent inter-
ventions either reported a short-term effect that was not sustained
at long-term follow-up (Skouteris 2015; Wyse 2012), or no effect
at either short- or long-term follow-up on children’s fruit or veg-
etable consumption (Duncanson 2013).
Multicomponent interventions
Short-term impact (less than 12 months)
The effects of multicomponent interventions were mixed. Meta-
analysis pooling post-intervention data (follow-up period range:
immediate to one month) from multicomponent intervention
trials (De Coen 2012; Namenek Brouwer 2013; Nicklas 2017;
Williams 2014) revealed no overall effect on child consumption
of fruit and vegetables (SMD 0.28, 95% CI -0.06 to 0.63; n =
1861; 4 studies; I2 = 79%; very low-quality evidence; Analysis
3.1). Results were similar in sensitivity analyses of three studies
with a primary aim of children’s fruit or vegetable consumption
(SMD 0.38, 95% CI -0.20 to 0.95; n = 1167; 3 studies; I2 =
86%; Analysis 3.2). There was, however, a positive overall effect
on child consumption of fruit and vegetables sensitivity analysis
of studies with no or low attrition or high attrition that undertook
intention-to-treat analyses (SMD 0.70, 95% CI 0.39 to 1.01; n
= 265; 2 studies; I2 = 0%; Analysis 3.3). We did not conduct a
sensitivity analysis to examine the impact of high risk of bias, as
all but one study had a high risk of bias in at least one domain.
Four studies could not be pooled in meta-analysis, due to insuffi-
cient data (De Bock 2012; Natale 2014a; Vereecken 2009; Witt
2012). Three trials (De Bock 2012; Natale 2014a; Witt 2012) re-
ported significant effects of the interventions tested on both fruit
and vegetable consumption, and one trial reported significant ef-
fects of the intervention on fruit but not vegetable consumption
(Vereecken 2009).
Long-term impact (12 months or longer)
No trials testing the multicomponent interventions reported long-
term impact.
Child nutrition education interventions
Short-term impact (less than 12 months)
The one study that tested the effect of a nutrition education in-
tervention targeting children (Baskale 2011) reported an increase
in some of the fruits and vegetables assessed in the intervention
group and no significant differences in the control group, but did
not report analyses comparing treatment groups (low-quality evi-
dence).
Long-term impact (12 months or longer)
The one study that tested the effect of a nutrition education in-
tervention did not report long-term impact.
Subgroup analyses
Interventions targeting boys and girls
All the included studies in this review covered both boys and girls.
The impact of intervention on gender subgroups was not reported
20

 in any of the included trials, so subgroup analyses on this basis was
not possible.
Interventions targeting minority groups and indigenous populations
Subgroup analyses of trials that targeted minority groups and in-
digenous populations was not possible, due to the limited number
of included studies for each comparison; we therefore present them
narratively. Six of the 50 included trials examined the impact of in-
terventions on predominantly disadvantaged populations (Black
2011; Cooke 2011; Haire-Joshu 2008; Natale 2014a; Nicklas
2017; Watt2009). One trial recruitedparticipantsthrough schools
where the proportion of children who had English as a second
language, came from minority ethnic backgrounds or were eligi-
ble for free school meals was above average (Cooke 2011). The
study demonstrated that repeated food exposure coupled with re-
ward significantly increased the consumption of a target vegetable.
Three trials of parent interventions recruited participants from
disadvantaged communities including underserved families, single
or minority parent homes, those living in poverty or low-income
families (Black 2011; Haire-Joshu 2008; Watt 2009). Two trials
found no improvement in overall child fruit or vegetable intake
based on the primary trial outcome measures (Haire-Joshu 2008;
Watt 2009); the other trial found the intervention targeting parent
responsivity and behaviour management to be effective in increas-
ing total fruit intake (Black 2011). Two trials of multicomponent
interventions recruited participants from subsidised childcare cen-
tres (Natale 2014a; Nicklas 2017). One found an intervention
targeting teachers, parents and childcare policies to increase both
fruit and vegetable consumption (Natale 2014a) and the other
found a theatre performance intervention involving both parents
and teachers increased vegetable consumption (Nicklas 2017).
Interventions delivered in various settings
Subgroup analyses of child-feeding practice interventions by set-
ting revealed an overall positive effect on children’s vegetable con-
sumption for those interventions delivered in home settings (SMD
0.56, 95% CI 0.18 to 0.95; n = 474; 4 studies) and in both home
and laboratory settings (SMD 0.74, 95% CI 0.09 to 1.39; n = 40;
2 studies), but no overall effect for those interventions delivered in
school or preschool settings (SMD 0.18, 95% CI -0.12 to 0.47; n
= 341; 3 studies). Subgroup analyses for other settings (including
one set in child health clinics, and one in home or health facilities)
was not possible due to the limited number of studies for each
setting.
Similar to the main analysis, subgroup analyses of parent nutrition
education interventions by setting revealed no overall effect for
those interventions delivered in a home setting (SMD 0.06, 95%
CI -0.16 to 0.27; n = 2047; 5 studies) or a preschool setting
(SMD 0.43, 95% CI -0.27 to 1.13; n = 243; 2 studies). Subgroup
analyses for other settings (one each in parenting groups, primary
care clinics or community health centres) was not possible, due to
the limited number of studies for each setting.
Similar to the main analysis, subgroup analyses of multicompo-
nent interventions by setting revealed no overall effect for those
interventions deliveredin school or preschool settings (SMD 0.07,
95% CI -0.07 to 0.20; n = 1608; 3 studies). Subgroup analyses
for interventions delivered in either a preschool or a home setting
were not possible, due to the limited number of studies for each
setting.
Interventions of varying intensities
We did not conduct subgroup analyses of trials based on interven-
tions of varying intensities, due to the limited information across
included studies about the number and duration of intervention
contacts or components.
Interventions delivered in different modalities
Thirty-eight of the 50 trials used face-to-face intervention delivery
only (Anzman-Frasca 2012; Barends 2013; Baskale 2011; Black
2011; Blissett 2016; Caton 2013; Cooke 2011; Correia 2014;
Cravener 2015; Daniels 2014; De Bock 2012; De Droog 2014;
De Wild 2013; De Wild 2015a; De Wild 2015b; Fildes 2014;
Fisher 2012; Harnack 2012; Hausner 2012; Hetherington 2015;
Keller 2012; Martinez-Andrade 2014; Menella 2008; Namenek
Brouwer 2013; O’Connell 2012; Remington 2012; Remy 2013;
Roe 2013; Roset-Salla 2016; Savage 2012; Skouteris 2015; Spill
2010; Spill 2011a; Spill 2011b; Verbestel 2014; Wardle 2003a;
Watt 2009; Witt 2012), reporting mixed findings. Similar to the
overall analyses, subgroup analysis of face-to-face-delivered child-
feeding practice interventions versus control revealed an overall
positive interventioneffectonvegetable consumption (SMD 0.38,
95% CI 0.10 to 0.65; n = 1328; 9 studies; Analysis 1.5). Face-
to-face-delivered parent nutrition education interventions versus
control revealed no overall intervention effect on children’s fruit
and vegetable consumption (SMD 0.12, 95% CI -0.20 to 0.45;
n = 826; 5 studies; Analysis 2.4). Face-to-face intervention deliv-
ery was used in only one multicomponent intervention (Namenek
Brouwer 2013) and the only child nutrition education interven-
tion (Baskale 2011), for which mixed results were reported.
Subgroup analyses for other modalities was not possible due to
the limited number of included studies for each comparison.
Eight trials used face-to-face in combination with other strate-
gies: computer-tailored newsletters and storybooks (Haire-Joshu
2008); school-based education, training, policy and environment
change (Vereecken 2009); visual and written materials (Campbell
2013); educational materials, resources (posters, brochures) and
letters (De Coen 2012); a leaflet (Fildes 2015); newsletters and
menu modification (Natale 2014a); printed materials and re-
sources (Williams 2014); and DVD (Nicklas 2017). Two trials
used audio/visual only: DVDs (Staiano 2016) and DVD and CD
(Duncanson 2013). The remaining two trials used telephone and
mail (Tabak 2012; Wyse 2012). Trials which incorporated other
intervention modalities reported mixed findings.
Secondary outcome I: Cost or cost effectiveness of interven-
tions to increase the consumption of fruit or vegetables or both
Information about intervention costs was reported in one trial
(Campbell 2013; very low-quality evidence). The parent nutrition
education trial reported the total estimated cost of delivering a par-
21

 ent intervention for infant feeding, physical activity and sedentary
behaviours delivered by a dietitian as approximately AUD 500 per
family.
Secondary outcome II: Adverse effects of interventions to in-
crease the consumption of fruit or vegetables or both
Two trials reported information on any adverse events or unin-
tended adverse consequences of the intervention. One child-feed-
ing intervention trial (Spill 2011a; very low-quality evidence) re-
ported no adverse effects on the amount of the meal consumed
following implementation of an intervention involving incorpo-
ration of vegetable puree into meals at three different levels of
energy density. The other trial, on parent nutrition education,
(Wyse 2012; very low-quality evidence) reported no adverse effect
on family food expenditure following implementation of a multi-
component intervention delivered over the telephone to improve
parental knowledge and skills about the home food environment.

Summary of main results
In line with the importance of encouraging fruit and vegetable
consumption among children in early childhood, this updated re-
view has identified many new RCTs of interventions investigating
this health behaviour. The findings suggest that some types of in-
terventions targeting fruit and vegetable consumption by children
aged five and younger are effective. Most of the included studies
examined specific child-feeding practices; whilst meta-analysis of
11 of the 30 trials suggested these interventions were effective, col-
lectively the findings for these interventions were equivocal. The
second and third most common interventions were parent nutri-
tion education and multicomponent interventions, for which we
found no evidence of effect in the short term in meta-analyses.
Only one trial assessed the effect of a child nutrition education
intervention. Subgroup analyses on the basis of setting and modal-
ity were generally consistent with main analyses for child-feed-
ing practices, parent nutrition education and multicomponent in-
terventions. Insufficient evidence was available to determine the
long-term effectiveness of all approaches, or the cost effectiveness
or any adverse consequences of the interventions tested.
Overall completeness and applicability of
evidence
The review update identified many newly published RCTs, in line
with efforts globally to increase fruit and vegetable intake (World
Health Organization 2003). Such studies predominantly focused
on fruit and vegetable consumption determinants such as nutri-
tion knowledge and skills, and food environments. Only one of
the included trials in this review reported cost analyses and only
two reported any unintended adverse effects. These factors are
important considerations for health practitioners and policy mak-
ers but are often not reported in randomised trials (Waters 2011)
or examined in systematic reviews (Hopewell 2008; Wolfenden
2010b).
Furthermore, the limited number of relevant trials identified for
inclusion also prevented thorough examination of the impact of
the interventions by gender, indigenous or disadvantaged popula-
tions, setting, varying intensity and modality. We found a number
of trial protocols (see Characteristics of ongoing studies) which
may address some of these gaps in the literature, and are likely to
be eligible for inclusion in future updates of the review, including
a randomised controlled trial of an eight-lesson in-home interven-
tion in economically and educationally disadvantaged parents of
children aged one to three years (Horodynski 2011).
The external validity of the review findings are limited. Most of the
trials were conducted in the USA, Western Europe or the United
Kingdom. Study attrition varied between studies, ranging from
0% to 68%.
Quality of the evidence
We used the GRADE approach to assess the quality of the evidence
for the primary outcome of fruit and vegetable intake, which was
conducted separately for each intervention type. See Summary
of findings for the main comparison; Summary of findings 2;
Summary of findings 3; Summary of findings 4. The quality of the
evidence for fruit and vegetable intake across intervention types
varied from very low to low. We rated the quality of evidence
for specific infant-feeding interventions as very low, downgraded
for unexplained heterogeneity, methodological limitations and a
high probability of publication bias (Summary of findings for the
main comparison). Methodological limitations related to alloca-
tion concealment and selective reporting being at unclear or high
risk for most of the trials. A high probability of publication bias
related to the relatively few trials being included in the meta-anal-
ysis (11 of 30 trials) and inspection of funnels plots (Figure 4).
We assessed the quality of evidence for parent nutrition education
interventions as very low, downgraded for unexplained hetero-
geneity, methodological limitations and imprecision (Summary of
findings 2; Figure 5). The methodological limitations related to
most of the trials being at high risk of bias for lack of blinding,
and at unclear or high risk for allocation concealment, loss to fol-
low-up, and selective reporting. Imprecision related to the confi-
dence intervals crossing the null value of zero.We rated the quality
of evidence for multicomponent interventions as very low due,
downgraded for unexplained heterogeneity, methodological limi-
tations and imprecision (Summary of findings 3; Figure 6). The
methodological limitations related to most of the trials being at
high risk of bias for lack of blinding, and at unclear or high risk for
allocation concealment, loss to follow-up, and selective reporting.
Imprecision related to the confidence intervals crossing the null
value of zero. Such assessments suggest that the true effect may
be substantially different from the intervention effects reported in
the review, with future research very likely to change the estimate
for specific infant feeding, parent nutrition education and mul-
ticomponent interventions. We rated the quality of the evidence
for child nutrition interventions for the single included study as
low, downgraded for methodological limitations and imprecision
(Summary of findings 4). The methodological limitations related
to a high risk of bias due to lack of blinding and loss to follow-
up, and imprecision related to a sample size of fewer than 400
participants. Future research is likely to change the estimate for
child nutrition interventions.

Potential biases in the review process
The review used a comprehensive and rigorous methodology, in-
cluding a broad search strategy, the screening of trials and extrac-
tion of data by two independent review authors, and the appraisal
of risks of bias within the included studies. Furthermore, the re-
view did not restrict publications by language. Three aspects of
selection bias, however, are worth noting. First, we excluded trials
where fruit and vegetable intake was not considered to be a pri-
mary trial outcome, to avoid any potential confounding effects of
other behavioural interventions (such as physical activity). This
restriction may lead to overestimates of intervention effects if in
practice they are delivered in the context of other health initia-
tives. Secondly, the inclusion of trials that did not explicitly state
a primary outcome but did assess fruit or vegetable intake in the
review may have biased the results. However sensitivity analyses
excluding studies that did not state fruit and vegetable intake as a
primary outcome suggested this was limited, as results were simi-
lar. Thirdly, the review was restricted to RCTs with trials included
in the review tending to focus on interventions targeting fruit and
vegetable consumption determinants, such as nutrition knowledge
and skills, or the food environment of settings. Other trials target-
ing fruit and vegetable intake that may be less amenable to evalua-
tion using randomised controlled designs, such as those requiring
macro-environmental changes, may have been overlooked.
Agreements and disagreements with other
studies or reviews
The equivocal findings of the infant-feeding interventions, such as
repeated food exposure, are similar in part to previous reviews. An
early systematic review of healthy eating interventions for children
aged under five years (Tedstone 1998), published by the Health
Education Authority, concluded that repeated food exposure is ef-
fective in enhancing children’s willingness to consume novel foods
provided tasting was included as a part of the exposure. Enhanced
food acceptance following repeated food exposure has also been
reported in other reviews and controlled trials (Contento 1995).
As Cooke 2011 points out in the Background review of research
for their randomised trial, evidence about the use of rewards to
encourage children’s consumption of targeted foods appears more
equivocal. The positive impact of both social and non-tangible
rewards reported in Cooke 2011, were however consistent with
previous trials in community settings using tangible non-food re-
wards and social rewards targeting the fruit or vegetable intake of
32

 school-aged children (Hendy 1999). The large number of trials
comparing alternative and heterogenous infant-feeding practice
interventions are difficult to interpret, given that they did not in-
clude a no-treatment control group, and few reported one inter-
vention to be more effective than another.
The largely null findings of this review for the impact of parent in-
terventions are consistent with those reported in previous reviews
of dietary interventions. For example, a comprehensive review of
the impact of home-visiting programmes delivered to parents con-
cluded that there was little evidence to recommend such interven-
tions as means of improving children’s diet, given the mixed find-
ings of the reviewed studies (Elkan 2000). Among the trials with
a positive intervention effect included in the Elkan 2000 review
was a pre-post study of an intensive intervention provided to low-
income mothers of children aged one to four years (James 1992).
In this study, dietician-trained general practitioners and health vis-
itors provided advice and support as part of a primary-care home-
visiting intervention lasting up to 20 weeks. Post-intervention im-
provements in diet were reported, including the consumption of
fruits and vegetables. Similarly, a systematic review that examined
the effectiveness of parental interventions on the diets of children
aged two to five found mixed results for children’s diets or feeding
practices or both (Peters 2012).
The negative findings for multicomponent interventions are con-
sistent with some previous reviews of interventions. A recent
meta-analysis showed no significant differences between multi-
component interventions that promoted fruit and vegetable con-
sumption and control conditions in a primary school setting
(Delgado-Noguera 2011). Another systematic review that focused
on the fruit and vegetable intake of children aged five to 12 found
that school-based interventions had only a minimal effect on veg-
etable consumption, whereas they found a moderate impact on
children’s fruit intake (Evans 2012). A recent systematic review
that examined interventions aimed at increasing children’s (aged
two to 12 years) vegetable intake in home and community settings
found that only a minority of interventions that targeted children’s
vegetable intake alone were effective in the short term (Hendrie
2017). In contrast, when vegetable intake was addressed as part of
a healthy diet or lifestyle intervention, most interventions showed
short-term effectiveness (Hendrie 2017).
In contrast to the findings of this review, a number of other re-
views have found multicomponent interventions to be effective.
For example, a systematic review of interventions to improve diet,
physical activity or to prevent weight gain for children of five
years or under, and which included both randomised and non-ran-
domised designs, identified nine studies of interventions imple-
mented in preschool or childcare settings (Hesketh 2010). Three
studies included some assessment of dietary outcome. In the first,
Head Start preschools were assigned to either a menu interven-
tion to reduce the fat content of meals provided to children in
care; the same menu intervention plus nutrition education; or a
third usual-care control condition (Williams 2004). Both inter-
vention arms of the trial reduced the fat content of foods served to
children compared with the preschools in the control condition.
The remaining two trials assessed the impact of a healthy eating
and physical activity obesity-prevention programme ‘Hip-Hop to
Health Jr’, implemented in two different populations attending
Head Start preschools (Fitzgibbon 2005; Fitzgibbon 2006). In
Fitzgibbon 2005, intervention children reported less saturated fat
intake at the one-year follow-up, but not total fat or dietary fibre.
No improvements in dietary intake were reported in the second
trial (Fitzgibbon 2006). Similarly, systematic reviews of school-
based fruit and vegetable interventions have frequently concluded
that multicomponent initiatives are the most effective in increas-
ing fruit and vegetable consumption in older children, but such
effects are only modest and reported to be driven largely by in-
creased fruit intake (Burchett 2003; Ciliska 2000; French 2003;
Knai 2006). A systematic review of European school-based inter-
ventions also concluded that multicomponent interventions are
effective for improving children’s fruit and vegetable intakes (Van
Cauwenberghe 2010).

Implications for practice
We found little evidence of effect for interventions to increase
the fruit and vegetable consumption of children aged five years,
to provide direction for health policy makers and practitioners.
There was no evidence of effect for parent nutrition education
or multicomponent interventions when pooled. Very low-quality
evidence suggests specific child-feeding interventions (such as re-
peated exposure and rewards) may be effective, but such findings
should be interpreted with caution, given that fewer than half of
the identified studies could be pooled in meta-analysis, and that
no data were reported for important outcomes such as costs and
unintended consequences. Additionally, the effect size for child-
feeding interventions was small (equivalent to an increase in veg-
etable intake of 4.03 grams), which may limit the potential public
health benefits of implementing these types of interventions.
Implications for research
Despite the large number of trials, the lack of high-quality re-
search in this area demonstrates the continuing considerable scope
for policy makers, researchers and practitioners to develop and
evaluate the impact of a variety of initiatives to improve fruit
and vegetable intake of children aged five years and under. Be-
havioural interventions delivered via health professionals, tele-
phone or computer-based programmes, interventions delivered
through preschools, play-groups, sports clubs, or co-operatives,
and those which address access issues through subsidies or other
incentives all have merit, and rigorous evaluation of such inter-
ventions for children aged five years and under would contribute
33

 greatly to the available evidence base to inform practice. As the
aetiology of child diet is complex, interventions which target mul-
tiple determinants across a number of settings may be most likely
to be effective.
This review identified a number of opportunities for future or
continued intervention research targeting the fruit and vegetable
consumption of children aged five years and under, including:
• the exploration and development of intervention strategies
that can achieve larger effect sizes;
• the investigation of potential adverse effects of
interventions (e.g. increased family grocery costs, or adverse
effects on parent self-esteem or sense of competence) as a routine
part of intervention trials;
• examination of the cost effectiveness of interventions found
to be effective;
• interventions with extended periods of follow-up;
• interventions delivered using electronic modalities such as
the web or smart phones;
• interventions implemented across a broader range of
settings including health services and sports clubs.

sylvania, USA
N (Randomised):
47 children
Age:
3 to 6 years (mean = 4.7 years)
% Female:
51%
SES and ethnicity:
Children: White = 83%, Asian = 10%
Parents: “Most parents were well-educated (median education = bachelor’s degree) and
were currently employed. The majority of parents reported being married (88%), and
the majority of the families reported annual combined family incomes greater than $60,
000 (89%).”
Inclusion/exclusion criteria:
No explicit inclusion criteria stated for this trial
Exclusion criteria: “Children were excluded if they had intolerance to study foods, a
chronic illness affecting food intake, or if they were non-English speaking. Additionally,
individuals with extended absences were excluded from the results.”
Recruitment:
Not specified
Recruitment rate:
Unknown
Region:
Central Pennsylvania (USA)
Interventions
Number of experimental conditions: 2
Number of participants (analysed):
41 (not specified by group)
Description of intervention:
“All children in each classroom received the same vegetable throughout the study”
“children were asked twice weekly over a period of 4 weeks to take of taste of a very small
portion (~4 g) of the vegetable in its assigned condition.”
Repeated exposure: Vegetable intake without dip
Flavor-flavor associative conditioning: Vegetable intake with dip. “Dips served in this
experiment included two savory dips (ketchup and ranch-flavored) and one sweet-tasting
dip (cinnamon sugar)”

Outcomes
Outcome relating to children’s fruit and vegetable consumption:
Consumption of target vegetable (grams). “Children were served a bowl containing 60
g of the vegetable, and children in the AC condition were also served ~60 g of dip in 3.
25 oz soufflé cups, which accompanied the vegetable…. Instructions to children prior
to the meal were to eat as much as they wanted, not to share food with others, and to
remain in their seats…. When children finished snack, spilled or dropped foods were
returned to the correct dish and snack trays were cleared. Vegetables were weighed before
serving and were weighed after the intake session was complete, and the difference was
recorded as vegetable intake.”
Outcome relating to absolute costs/cost effectiveness of interventions:
Not reported
Outcome relating to reported adverse events:
Not reported
Length of follow-up from baseline:
9 weeks
Length of follow-up post-intervention:
2 weeks
Subgroup analyses:

(Continued)
Random sequence generation (selection
bias)
Unclear risk
Randomly allocated to experimental group
but the random sequence generation pro-
cedure is not described
Allocation concealment (selection bias)
Unclear risk
There is no information provided about al-
location concealment and therefore it is un-
clear if allocation was concealed
Blinding of participants and personnel
(performance bias)
All outcomes
High risk
Participants were not blinded and it seems
likely that children may have been in-
fluenced by those children around them
and whether or not other children had a
flavoured dip
Blinding of outcome assessment (detection
bias)
All outcomes
Low risk
Food was weighed and it is unlikely to be
influenced by whether the researchers were
blinded to condition
Incomplete outcome data (attrition bias)
All outcomes
Low risk
There does not appear to be any attrition
and therefore low risk of attrition bias
Selective reporting (reporting bias)
Unclear risk
There is no study protocol so it is unclear
if there was selective outcome reporting
Other bias
Low risk
Contamination, baseline imbalance, &
other bias that could threaten the internal
validity are unlikely to be an issue

Number of participants (analysed):
Green beans group = 24
Artichoke group = 27
Apple group = 24
Plum group = 24
Description of intervention:
At the lab (days 1,2,17,18 and 19): “A bowl with two jars of vegetable purée was handed
to the mother and the mother fed the infant at their usual rate until the end of the feeding
was indicated by the infant (i.e. when it rejected the spoon more than three successive
times).”
At the home (days 3 - 16): “At the end of the 2nd test-day at the lab, the mothers
received the jars of puréed vegetables or fruits for the home exposure period. Each jar
was labelled with the date on which it had to be fed to the infant and numbered from 3
to 16 corresponding to the respective days of the intervention period. The feeding was
carried out every day at about the same time and in the same way as during days 1 and
2 in the lab.”
Duration:
19 days

Outcomes
Outcome relating to children’s fruit and vegetable consumption:
Consumption of target vegetable and fruit purees (grams).
At the lab: “The pre- and post-weight of the bowl including the spoon and bib was
weighted to measure the actual intake.”
At the home: “The mother was instructed to empty both jars completely on a plate and
to put all what was left over after the feeding, including the vegetable purée that was
spilled on the table, floor, bib, child’s face, etc., back in the jar and to seal the jar with
the lid and put it in the refrigerator…. In order to have a standardized measure of home
intake, the jars had been pre-weighted in the lab before the home exposure period, and
after they were collected and were post-weighted again in the lab.”

SES and ethnicity:
“To ensure adequate representation of children from families of low socioeconomic
status, we selected schools in which the proportions of pupils who were eligible for free
school meals, who spoke English as a second language, and who came from minority
ethnic backgrounds were above the national average.” No individual child data on these
variables were reported

Interventions
Number of experimental conditions: 4
Number of participants (analysed):
Exposure + tangible non-food reward (sticker) = 99
Exposure + social reward (praise) = 106
Exposure alone = 105
Control = 112
Description of interventions:
“Children in the intervention conditions (ETR, EP
, EA)* were seen individually from
Day 3 to Day 14 and offered a small piece of their target vegetable.”
Exposure + tangible non-food reward: “Children in the ETR condition were told that if
they tasted the vegetable, they could choose a sticker as a reward.”
Exposure + social reward: “Children in the EP condition were praised if they tasted the
vegetable (e.g. “Brilliant, you’re a great taster”)
Exposure alone: “Children in the EA condition were invited to taste the target vegetable
but received minimal social interaction.”
Duration:
3 weeks
Number of contacts:
12 exposure sessions
Setting:
School
Modality:
Face-to-face, exposure
Interventionist:
Trained researchers
Integrity:
“Children in the three intervention groups agreed to taste their target vegetable in most
sessions“
Exposure + tangible non-food reward (sticker): M = 11.34 sessions, SD = 1.45
Exposure + social reward (praise): M = 10.45 sessions, SD = 1.94;
Exposure alone: M = 9.97 sessions,SD = 2.87.
“Post hoc analyses showed higher compliance in the ETR condition than in the EP or
EA conditions (p < 0.05), and compliance in the latter two conditions did not differ.”

Date of study:
Unknown
Description of control:
No-treatment control: “Children in the control group did not receive taste exposure to
the target vegetable during the intervention period.”
Outcomes
Outcome relating to children’s fruit and vegetable consumption:
Ad libitum consumption of target vegetable (grams). “The child was then invited to eat
as much of the vegetable as he or she wanted, with intake (in grams) assessed by weighing
the dish before and after consumption using a digital scale” (NB. “Care was taken to
ensure that children in the ETR condition understood that the sticker reward was no
longer available.”)
Length of follow-up from baseline:
Acquisition data: day 15
Maintenance data: 1 month and 3 months later
Subgroup analyses:
None
Loss to follow-up (at 1 month and 3 months follow-up):
Exposure + tangible non-food reward (sticker): 7%, 9%
Exposure + social reward (praise): 8%, 5%
Exposure alone: 8%, 8%
Control: 11%, 6%
Analysis:
Analysis adjusted for clustering“Clustering by school was minimal; therefore, the final
analyses adjusted only for clustering by class.”
Sample size calculation was performed
“On the basis of evidence that 10 exposures are needed to alter preferences, we decided
to repeat all analyses for a restricted subset of children who tasted their target vegetable
on at least 10 days (n=365). Because there were no significant differences between the
restricted and the full samples, results are reported for the full sample.”

“children in the treatment group (n=12) received vegetables packaged in containers
decorated with their four favorite cartoon characters (selected on the first visit) and
granola bars in generic packaging. All vegetable packages contained sticker incentives
and children could collect stickers on a special game board and trade them for small
prizes at the end of the study. This was done to simulate the concept of promotions that
often come with packaged foods. Parents were in charge of deciding when children had
eaten enough of a vegetable to be awarded the sticker for their game boards.”
Duration:

Integrity:
“To assess compliance, parents completed daily checklists across the intervention to
report when vegetables and granola bars were offered and record what children selected.
In addition, parents could also report additional comments on these checklists to report
other concerns or deviations. Parents were also responsible for keeping daily food diaries
for children (data to be reported elsewhere). These logs were reviewed with parents during
weekly home visits to assess progress.”

Analysis:
Sample size calculation was performed.
Analysis was not adjusted for clustering, but justification was provided. “As our data
stemmed from natural pre-school-bound clusters of children, we first determined the
extent of clustering. Intraclass correlation coefficients (ICC) on the level of pre-schools
were 0.016 and 0.014 for the primary outcomes of fruit intake and vegetable intake,
respectively. With an average cluster size of 19.5 children per pre-school, the design effect
(d = 1 + (average cluster size -1) x ICC) did not exceed 2, allowing us to ignore the issue

Methods
Study design:
Cluster-randomised controlled trial
Funding:
“The study was commissioned, financed and steered by the Ministry of the Flemish
Community (Department of Economics, Science and Innovation; Department of Wel-
fare, Public Health and Family).”
Participants
Description:
Children attending pre-primary and primary schools from 6 communities in Flanders,
Belgium
N (Randomised):
31 schools, 1589 children
Age:
Mean: Intervention = 4.86 years, Control = 5.04 years
% Female:
Intervention = 47%, Control = 55%
SES and ethnicity:
% Of lower SES children: Intervention = 34%, Control = 29%
Inclusion/exclusion criteria:
Not specified
Recruitment:
“All pre-primary and primary schools in the six communities were invited to participate
in the study.”
Recruitment rate:
Child: 49% (1589/3242)
School: 64% (31/49)
Region:
Flanders (Belgium)
Interventions
Number of experimental conditions: 2
Number of participants (analysed):
Intervention = 396, Control = 298
Description of intervention:
“The intervention was based on the ‘Nutrition and Physical Activity Health Targets’
of the Flemish Community clustered into: (i) increasing daily consumption of water
and decreasing soft drinks consumption; (ii) increasing daily milk consumption; (iii)
increasing daily consumption of vegetables and fruit; (iv) decreasing daily consumption
of sweets and savoury snacks; and (v) increasing daily PA and decreasing screen-time
behaviour.”
The community
“Each intervention year, information brochures and posters regarding the five topics of
the project were distributed through general practitioners, pharmacists, social services
and at relevant community events by the regional health boards and the research team.”
The schools
“All intervention schools were requested to (i) implement five Healthy Weeks per in-
tervention year (one for each cluster of topics) with a minimum 1 h of classroom time
dedicated to the topic together with extracurricular activities (e.g. during the vegetables
and fruits week only fruits could be brought to school as a snack; schools organized fruit
and vegetable tastings), (ii) evaluate and improve their playground and snack and bev-

erage policy, and (iii) communicate with the parents on the programme and distribute
materials to the parents. The intervention started with a meeting with the teachers during
which they received manuals and guidelines and an implementation plan was discussed.
”
The parents
“The intervention materials for the parents were newly developed for the project. The
parents received a poster visualizing the target messages and containing short tips regard-
ing parenting practices and styles to encourage children to stick to the healthy eating
and PA targets. Parents also received five letters, containing detailed information on the
intervention topics and a website link with practical information such as tips and recipes.
Based on the FFQ in the parental questionnaire, parents received a written, normative
individual tailored advice on their child’s consumption of water, milk, fruits, vegetables,
soft drinks and sweet and savoury snacks, and their PA and screen-time behaviour.”
The regional health boards
“They contacted each school at least twice per year assisting them in selecting relevant
intervention materials and supervising the implementation progress.”
Duration:
“The intervention was implemented over two school years (2008-2009 and 2009-2010)
on different levels.”
Number of contacts:
Unclear (multi-component)
Setting:

Modality:
Multiple (face-to-face, educational materials, resources (posters, brochures), letters)
Interventionist:
Multiple
Integrity:
“Process evaluation data revealed that all schools implemented the requested classroom
hour. Regarding the snack and playground policy, it was clear that the requested adjust-
ments asked for more time investment and at the time of observation, most schools did
not yet meet up to the standard.”

Notes
First reported outcome (fruit consumption grams/day) was extracted for inclusion in

post-intervention data and calculated an effective sample size using ICC of 0.016 to
enable inclusion in meta-analysis

Interventions
Number of experimental conditions: 2
Number of participants (analysed):
Intervention = 605, Control = 701
Description of intervention:
Intervention families received the standard PAT program plus the ’Hi 5 for Kids’ (H5-
KIDS) protocol. “H5-KIDS was comprised of three components: a tailored newsletter,
a series of home visits, and materials for the parent and child, including storybooks.”
Computer-tailored nutrition newsletter
“To develop the tailored newsletter, parents were rst formally enrolled in H5-KIDS
and completed a pretest interview. Relevant data was then imported into an in-house
computer-based tailoring program. Scores were calculated based on FV knowledge and
intake, frequency of parental modeling, style of parenting (coercive or non-coercive),
and quality of the home food environment (FV availability). Each newsletter began with
a bulleted tailored statement that included the self reported servings of FVs the parent
and the child consumed per day. Additional parent data (e.g. FV knowledge, parental
role modeling, non-coercive parenting skills, FV availability) were each uniquely used
to individualize messages and describe the themes of each of the four storybook sets the
family would receive at their home visits. For example, if participant data indicated a
parent did not eat FV in front of their child very often (< 7/week), the tailored messages
would emphasize the importance of modeling FV intake in front of the child as a
means of improving consumption, and provide relevant examples of how this could
be accomplished. The parent was then referred to H5-KIDS storybooks that provided
examples of modeling for the child. In contrast, parents who scored appropriately in each
individual area received messages of praise encouraging them to continue their behaviors.
Newsletters were mailed to the parent’s home at the beginning of the program.”
Home visits
“Parent educators delivered four H5-KIDS home visits, each of which addressed the
core program areas (knowledge, parental modeling of FV intake, non-coercive feeding
practices, FV availability). Parent educators then reinforced the core content in subse-
quent visits. Consistent with the philosophy of the PAT program, each visit provided
examples of parent-child activities designed around healthy nutrition, that the parent
could use to promote the child’s language and cognitive ability, and ne and gross motor
skill development (e.g. having the child learn the names and colors of various FV; child
assists with selecting a variety of FV for breakfast). As part of each visit, parents also
received materials and informational handouts with suggestions for improving feeding
practices and the food environment in the home. Consistent with the standard PAT
program, each home visit was designed to allow for 60 min of contact.”
Sing-a-long storybooks with audio cassette
“At each home visit children received a H5-KIDS sing-a-long storybook with audio

H5-KIDS program through the use of child friendly characters and appealing storylines
presented through songs.”
Duration:
60 minutes per home visit
Number of contacts:
4 H5-KIDS home visits plus 5 standard PAT home visits
Setting:
Home
Modality:
Face-to-face via home visits
Interventionist:
Parent educators who received 4 hours of training on nutrition content and overview of
materials
Integrity:
“The H5-KIDS program was delivered in its entirety to 78% of intervention families.”
Date of study:
2001 to 2006
Description of control:
“Parent educators deliver a standardized curriculum via at least five home visits, on-site
group activities and newsletters.” (“PAT ... empowers parents ... by encouraging positive
parent-child communication and increasing parents’ knowledge of ways to stimulate
children’s social and physical development.”)
Outcomes
Outcome relating to children’s fruit and vegetable consumption:
Child’s daily servings of fruits and of vegetables assessed using the Saint Louis Univer-
sity for Kids Food Frequency Questionnaire (SLU4Kids FFQ) administered by parent
telephone survey
Length of follow-up from baseline:
Average time to follow-up was 7 months (range 6 to 11 months)
Subgroup analyses:
Normal weight vs overweight children
Loss to follow-up:
Intervention: 15% (+ 5% missing or inconsistent data)
Control: 17% (+ 5% missing or inconsistent data)
Analysis:
Analysis was not adjusted, but justification was provided. “There was minimal impact
of grouping by site on the principle measures of impact in this study (ICC child fruit
and vegetable servings = 0.00095 and ICC parent fruit and vegetable servings = 0.01).
Therefore, the analyses did not adjust for group.”
Sample size calculation was performed.
Notes
The proportion of normal weight vs overweight children not reported, making it difficult
to interpret the subgroup analysis. First reported outcome (fruit intake) was extracted
for inclusion in meta-analysis
Sensitivity analysis - primary outcome: Primary outcome not stated, fruit or vegetable
intake only reported outcome

Usual ‘control’ meal service: “
”During each day of the control weeks, the usual traditional family style meal service
approach to serving lunch meals at the center was followed. During usual lunch meals at
the center children are seated around tables, and each food item on the menu is passed
around the table from child to child in serving bowls for self-service.”

Study 2: vegetables
“The three groups differed in the type, amount and variety of foods that infants were fed
during the target meal during the 8-day home exposure period. The infants in the Green
Bean Group (N=11) were fed only the target vegetable, green beans, whereas those in the
Between-Meal variety group (BM Vegetable Variety Group, N=12) and the Between-
Meal and Within-Meal Variety Group (BM-WM Vegetable Variety Group, N=12) were
fed a variety of vegetables. The BM Variety Group was fed only one vegetable each day
and green and orange vegetables were alternated daily, whereas the BM-WM Variety
Group was fed two vegetables each day (one green, one orange). In the latter group, the
pair of vegetables varied from day-to-day but one of the pair was experienced the prior

4 childcare centres, “An average of 19.0 (7.9) children were enrolled per center”
Description of intervention:
“The Watch Me Grow program is a garden-based intervention aimed to increase the
number of vegetables and fruits provided to and consumed by children in child care.
The intervention took place in spring 2011. The program includes a “crop-a-month”
structured curriculum for child-care providers, consultation by a gardener, and technical
assistance from a health educator. Over the course of the four-month-long intervention,
providers and children in the intervention centers grew (1) lettuce, (2) strawberries, (3)
spinach, and (4) broccoli. We designed the garden to yield one crop per month, and
provided classrooms in the intervention centers with corresponding curriculum materials
highlighting the target fruit or vegetable of the month.”

percent of the sample were primarily Spanish speaking and completed the measures in
Spanish, and 65% of the sample were primarily English speaking and completed the
measures in English”
Inclusion/exclusion criteria:
“Center study inclusion criteria consisted of (a) serve >30 children, (b) serve low-income
children, and (c) ethnic makeup had to be reflective of the county as a whole (minority
majority). Low income was determined based on whether or not the child received
subsidized child care.”

and vegetables with an emphasis on cultural barriers
Parent curriculum: Modeled after a modified version of the Eating Right Is Basic and
Hip-Hop to Health Jr., included a monthly educational dinner (run by dietitians) in
which nutrition and physical activity were discussed, monthly newsletters, and at-home
activities, also information on how to introduce new foods and how to encourage eating
more fruits and vegetables. Parents were encouraged to reduce TV viewing, increase
physical activity, and model healthy eating behaviours for their child at home
Centre-based modifications: These included: the development of policies to increase
physical activity and healthy eating; modifying menus to make them compliant with the
policies and also to ensure that the U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA) nutritional
requirements were met; agreeing on a drink policy that included providing water as the
primary beverage, not allowing juice or sweetened beverages more than one time per
week; changing from whole milk to 1% milk; having a snack policy which consisted of
substituting healthy snacks, such as fresh fruit and/or vegetables, for cookies and other
high-lipid snacks; having a physical activity policy to increase physical activity to more
than one hour per day and to decrease TV viewing to less than 60 minutes two times a
week

The intervention included 4 DVDs (videos) theatre-based puppet shows that aimed at
persuading children to increase vegetable consumption through encouragement, ratio-
nale/reason, reinforcement, and role modeling that were delivered over 4 consecutive
weeks at preschools. Additionally, “each intervention child took home a bag including
the DVD video for that week, a pamphlet, main ingredients to prepare a simple vegetable
snack, crayons, and a disposable camera (if parents did not have a smart phone) to use
as instructed in the booklets.”

Outcome relating to children’s fruit and vegetable consumption:
Child’s consumption of varied artichoke purees (grams). “To measure intake, parents
were asked to weigh each jar before and after consumption, using a digital kitchen scale
(61 g, Soehnle) that we provided them with, and to record the weight in a notebook.
After each observation, parents were required to reseal the jar(s) of food, freeze them, and
bring the used jars back to the laboratory to check compliance with the study procedure
and data accuracy.”

to achieve practical skills in addition to nutritional knowledge. Cognitive (teaching
how to improve diet), emotional (addressing beliefs and attitudes of the participants
through discussion and analysis techniques) and skill areas (developing dietary skills)
were included. The aim was to incorporate new and better dietary knowledge and to
change the habits of the participants.”

Notes
First reported outcome (changes in vegetable and garden produce servings per day) was
extracted for inclusion in the meta-analysis. To enable inclusion in meta-analysis, we
calculated post-intervention means by group by summing baseline and change from
baseline means, assuming baseline SDs for post-intervention SDs, and we calculated an
effective sample size using ICC of 0.014 to account for clustering

Unclear risk
“Incidents of food and drink spillage were
recorded by researchers. Teachers were in-
structed to redirect conversations pertain-
ing to food to nonfood-related topics to
minimize the influence on lunch intake.”
Children were not blinded and it seems un-
likely that this would influence their in-
take. Staff present during the meal and staff
who served the food to children were not
blinded and it seems unlikely this would
influence child intake

Appears that researchers who weighed
the food were the same researchers who
recorded incidents of food and drink
spillage. Researchers were not blinded and
this may have had an impact on how the
outcome was recorded in different class-

Description of intervention:
“addressed vegetable and food issues based on the baseline surveys, and the dietitian
helped parents select 1 primary target area for improvement during the intervention
from 4 possible options (vegetable availability; picky eating; modeling; family meals).
These areas were selected based on Social Cognitive Theory, which posits that there is
reciprocal interaction between an individual and his/her environment. This theory also
highlights the importance of self-efficacy, which was thus a target of the intervention as
well.”

Number of experimental conditions: 2
Number of participants (analysed):
Intervention = 308, Control = 168
Description of intervention:
8 preschools received a multi-component intervention to assist schools to implement a
healthy school food policy. “The main objectives were to increase the consumption of
fruit, vegetables and water and to decrease the consumption of sugared milk drinks and
fruit juice.”
The main strategies to influence the child and the different environmental factors in-
cluded:
“Child: Guided and self-guided activities based on experiential education (e.g. tasting)
and developmental education (e.g. explanation of concepts of food triangle); Role model,
feed back and reinforcement by teachers; Educational role-model story and characters;
Availability of healthy foods; Availability of cooking equipment.
Parents: Newsletters; Suggestions for the back and forth diary; Work sheets and creations
by children; Parent evenings and other school activities with parents
Teacher: Training sessions; Manual including didactic and policy aspects; Digital learning
environment; Newsletters; Group discussions with teachers; Examples of good practices
School environment: Newsletters; Training sessions for principals and cafeteria staff;
Help on demand via e-mail; Examples of good practices; Policy aspects in the teachers’
manual; Feedback to schools.”

Description of intervention:
Exposure: Taste exposure intervention carried out in the home where parents were asked
to offer their child a taste of a target vegetable daily for 14 consecutive days. Parents
were given suggestions to encourage the child to taste the vegetable. Parents were given
a vegetable diary to record their experiences, and children could record their liking for
the vegetable after each session using ’face’ stickers

given a leaflet with advice and suggestions for increasing children’s fruit and vegetable
consumption
Duration:
14 days
Number of contacts:
14 (daily for 14 consecutive days)
Setting:

and 6 imaginary trips. The majority of the CMH circle-time lessons focus on fruits and
vegetables of different colors. Several of the lessons provide opportunities for children to
try fruits and vegetables. The 6 imaginary trips included in CMH encourage children to
use their imagination to explore places, be physically active, and eat fruits and vegetables.
Six interactive take home activities were developed for the current evaluation. These
interactive activities coincided with the circle-time lessons.”

Inclusion/exclusion criteria:
Preschool:
Inclusion criteria: licensed in NSW
Exclusion criteria: “Preschools will be excluded from the trial if they provide meals to
children in their care (as this limits parents’ capacity to influence the foods their children
consume), cater exclusively for children with special needs (given the specialist care
required for such children), are Government preschools (as conduct of the research has
not been approved by the New South Wales Government Department of Education and
Training) or have participated child healthy eating research projects within six months
of the commencement of recruitment.”
Parent:
Inclusion criteria: “participant must be a parent of a child aged 3 to 5 years attending a
participating preschool, must reside with that child for at least four days a week (in order
for the child to be sufficiently exposed to the intervention strategies that the parent may
implement), must have some responsibility for providing meals and snacks to that child,
and must be able to understand spoken and written English.”
Exclusion criteria: “Parents will be excluded from the trial if their children have special
dietary requirements or allergies that would necessitate specialised tailoring of the in-
tervention or that may be adversely affected by the intervention. Such exclusions will
be determined by an Accredited Practising Dietitian who is independent of the research
team.”
Recruitment:
Preschools randomly selected
“The supervisors of the selected preschools will be sent letters and consent forms in-
forming them of the study and requesting permission to recruit parents through their
services.”
Recruitment packs will be delivered to each participating preschool
Distribution of these packs to parents will occur via methods considered by the preschool
supervisor to be most effective and appropriate in engaging parents
Where possible, research staff will attend the preschool, hand out recruitment packs to
parents and be available to answer parent questions
Recruitment rate:
Preschool = 51% (30/59)
Region:
New South Wales (Australia)

Description of intervention:
The intervention group will receive a resource kit and weekly scripted telephone contacts
“The kit comprises a participant workbook containing information and activities, a pad
of meal planners, and a cookbook including recipes high in fruit and vegetables.”
“Each telephone contact aims to provide parents with appropriate knowledge and skills
to modify three key domains within the home food environment: availability and ac-
cessibility of fruit and vegetables; supportive family eating routines, and parental role-
modelling.”
Duration:
4 weeks
Number of contacts:
4 (one a week)
Setting:
Home
Modality:
Telephone and mailed resources
Interventionist:
Trained telephone interviewers
Integrity:
“During each four-week batch of telephone calls, members of the research team will
monitor at least two completed calls made by each interviewer to assess adherence with
the intervention protocol.”
“In total, 44 intervention calls were monitored, representing 6% of all completed calls
and an average of 9 calls per interventionist. Across all monitored calls, interventionists
covered 97% of key content areas, and in .80% of calls they “rarely” deviated from the
script. In instances in which calls deviated from the script, interventionists were pro-
vided with feedback immediately after the call, and the issue was raised during biweekly
supervision.”
Date of study:
April to December 2010
Description of control:
“Parents allocated to the control group were mailed the Australian Guide to Healthy
Eating-a 22-page booklet outlining the dietary guidelines and ways to meet them.”

Notes
The fruit and vegetable score outcome at the longest follow-up < 12 months (6 months)
was extracted for inclusion in meta-analysis. The reported estimate and 95% CI which
adjusted for baseline and clustering were included in meta-analysis

Risk of bias
Bias
Authors’ judgement
Support for judgement
Random sequence generation (selection
bias)
Low risk
The random sequence was generated using
a random-number function in Microsoft
Excel
Allocation concealment (selection bias)
Unclear risk
There is no information provided about al-
location concealment and therefore it is un-
clear if allocation was concealed
Blinding of participants and personnel
(performance bias)
All outcomes
High risk
Fruit and vegetable intake (self-reported):
Participants were unblinded and this is
likely to influence performance
Blinding of outcome assessment (detection
bias)
All outcomes
High risk
Fruit and vegetable intake (self-reported):
Participants were unblinded and because
self-reported measure this is likely to influ-
ence detection bias
Incomplete outcome data (attrition bias)
All outcomes
Low risk
Of 394 parents, 343 (87%) completed
the 6-month follow-up. Sensitivity analyses
were also conducted where missing follow-
up data were imputed by using baseline ob-
servation carried forward
Selective reporting (reporting bias)
Low risk
The primary outcomes reported in the out-
comes paper align with those specified in
the protocol. The 12- and 18-month fruit
and vegetable outcomes are reported in
Wolfenden 2014
Other bias
Low risk
Contamination, baseline imbalance, &
other bias that could threaten the internal
validity are unlikely to be an issue. Analyses
adjusted for clustering

The intervention programme was not specifically designed to increase consumption of fruit and

illustrates the use of co-twin design for testing substitution, phenomenon, a prominent behavioural
economics concept. We test whether fruits and vegetables can substitute for high-fat snack foods in
young children in a single meal laboratory setting.”

Healthy Start-Départ Santé
Methods
Cluster-randomised controlled trial
Participants
Approximately 735 children aged 3 - 5 years from 62 Early Childcare Centres
Interventions
Intervention: “The intervention is composed of six interlinked components which are presented in more
detail in Fig. 1. These components include: 1) intersectoral partnerships conducive to participatory action
that leads to promoting healthy weights in communities and ECC; 2) the Healthy Start-Départ Santé imple-
mentation manual for educators on how to integrate healthy eating and physical activity in their centre; 3)
customized training, role modelling and monitoring of Healthy Start-Départ Santé in ECC; 4) the evidence-
based resource, LEAP-GRANDIR [16], which contains material for both families and educators; 5) supple-
mentary resources from governmental partners; and 6) a knowledge development and exchange (KDE), and
communication strategy involving social media and web-resources to raise awareness and mobilize grassroots
organizations and communities
Healthy Start-Départ Santé is delivered over 6-8 months and includes a partnership agreement, an initial
training session which orients ECC staff to the concepts, the implementation manual and the use of resources,
on-going support and monitoring over time, one tailored booster session, and a family day to celebrate the
ECC’ success at the end of the intervention.”
Control: “Usual practice controls” “Control sites are given the option of receiving the intervention once their
participation in the evaluation has been completed”
Outcomes
Usual intake of fruits and vegetables assessed via parent-reported semi-quantitative food frequency question-

Trial name or title
The Healthy Toddlers Trial
Methods
Randomised controlled trial
Participants
Approximately 600 children aged 12 to 26 months recruited from community programmes, immunisation
clinics and food pantries
Interventions
Intervention: “HTaddressescore nutrition conceptsbutmoveswell beyondbasicnutrition to address maternal
self-efficacy during feeding, appropriate feeding styles, and practices, including skill development to increase
success in making these behavioural changes.”
“The HT intervention consists of eight in-home visits by a specially trained paraprofessional instructor
plus four weekly telephone follow-up reinforcement contacts. Particularly for high-risk families with young
children, providing services within the context of the family’s home environment appears to be a useful and
effective strategy to provide parents with information, emotional support, access to other services and direct
education [19]. The home-visitation model also engages families who lack transportation or child care, a
challenge frequently reported by families with low incomes. Paraprofessional instructors are peer educators
who can relate to the target audience. Research shows that people learn best from their peers (people like
themselves). Eight home visit sessions have been found to produce behavioral change [20]. At each visit, the
paraprofessional spends approximately 1 hour with the mother and toddler dyad. The HT lessons use a variety
of techniques and materials to enhance each mother’s learning experience and help reinforce knowledge. Each
lesson includes opportunities for discussion, hands-on activities, and an opportunity for mothers to practice
skills covered in the lesson. The eight lessons include a lesson plan, handouts, and recipes. Mothers receive a
notebook binder at the beginning of Lesson 1.”
Control: “The control group families receive the usual services provided by Building strong families (BSF)
or Expanded Food and Nutrition Education Program (EFNEP) in respective states. These families are newly
enrolled into BSF or EFNEP as part of the HT study and have not received home visitation previously. The
control lessons are similarly delivered as the HT lessons, such that, a paraprofessional instructor provides eight
lessons during an in-home visit, which last approximately 60 minutes. However, the control lessons focus on
parenting (BSF) or nutrition (EFNEP) and do not include extensive content on feeding toddlers. Parapro-
fessionals who provide the lessons for the control group families are different to prevent cross contamination
between the two groups.”
Outcomes
Child fruit and vegetable intake will be assessed via 3-day dietary record of child’s intake

Interventions
Intervention: “Play & Grow is a 10-week family-based, multi-component healthy lifestyle programme”
“The Play & Grow will have educational strategies including instructions, parental peer support and group
discussions, and homework tasks, in accordance with the elements developed in our Play & Grow pilot study.
Each session will comprise: (i) 15 min of guided active play involving both children and parents; (ii) 15 min
of interactive education and skill development for parents; simultaneous supervised active play with foods
for children, to promote acceptance of vegetables, and (iii) 15 min of guided active nature games outdoors,
involving both children and parents. The sessions will incorporate a lifestyle component, for example: eating,
active play and connectedness to nature). These will target the parents’ knowledge and skills on how to
introduce and maintain their child’s correct lifestyle routines. A group leader and co-leader with healthcare
backgrounds (and trained by the PI during the Play & Grow pilot study) will facilitate the sessions involving
4 to 5 parent-child dyads. The proposed intervention, we will employ environmental education and nature-
related activities to help participating families develop skills conducive to improving playtime and eating
habits in children.”
Control: “The (waiting list or control group) WLCG children will be offered the Play & Grow programme
at study completion”
Outcomes
Child fruit and vegetable intake will be assessed using the Eating and Physical Activity Questionnaire (EPAQ)
and The Children’s Eating Behaviour Questionnaire (CEBQ)

Choosing Healthy Eating when Really Young (CHERRY)
Methods
Randomised controlled trial
Participants
Approximately 288 parents of children aged 18 months to 5 years from children’s centres
Interventions
Intervention: “The intervention group participants attended four sessions (one each week) over 4 weeks. Each
session lasted 2 h. The first hour of each session involved parents discussing and learning about a variety of
aspects of healthy eating while the children attended a free crèche in the adjacent room (the crèche activities
were not considered part of CHERRY and were not monitored). The second hour involved parents. and
children together for a more practical, ‘hands on’ cook and eat session involving basic food preparation and
tasting. Each session began with a recap from the previous week and finished with parents being given a
‘CHERRY at home’ activity to complete before the following week’s session; these were both designed to
consolidate parents’ learning
The intervention group also received SMS reminders via mobile phones between sessions; SMSs included the
main messages of the CHERRY programme, as well as reminders to attend each session. The intervention
comprised not only individually focused nutrition support, but also encompassed activities directed at devel-
oping the capacity of the children’s centre to promote and maintain healthy nutritional practices
In the intervention centres, a staff training session was offered to all staff working in the centres. The training
session covered various aspects of healthy eating and nutrition for early years and included an introduction
and overview of the CHERRY programme. Each training session was tailored to the needs of the staff, as

identified by heads of each intervention centre. Intervention centres were also given support and advice to
revise and develop their centre’s food policies in order to support healthy eating practices and procedures.”
Control: “The children’s centres randomised to the control group did not receive any of the components
of the CHERRY programme. During the study period, the control centres agreed not to implement any
new nutritional interventions but continued with existing support. On final completion of the study, the
CHERRY resources were disseminated to control centres and other early years settings interested in nutrition.
”
Outcomes
”Child’s fruit and vegetable consumption at home (portions per day). This was defined as the total weight
(grams) of fruit and vegetables consumed the number of different types of fruit and vegetables consumed, and
the actual types of fruit and vegetables consumed. The child’s diet was assessed using the multiple-pass 24-
h recall method. As the children concerned were under 5 years of age, the parents completed the interviews
on their behalf.”
Starting date
Parents were recruited into the study over 5 recruitment waves between September 2010 and November 2011

Appendix 1. Cochrane’s living systematic review pilots
Living systematic reviews offer a new approach to review updating in which the review is continually updated, incorporating relevant new
evidence as it becomes available (Elliott (in press)). Cochrane is exploring the feasibility of preparing and publishing living systematic
reviews in a series of pilots, which includes this review. For the Cochrane pilots, searching is being conducted monthly, and we will
incorporate new relevant evidence (studies, data or other information) into the review in a timely manner, so that the findings of the
review remain current.
For the most up-to-date information about the review, the results of the searches and any new evidence being incorporated, we encourage
readers to check the update status information. We will revise the update status information whenever the searches are re-run. We will
update the review with a new citation whenever we find a new trial, or relevant information about already-included trials (e.g. new
outcome data).

 Appendix 3. Living systematic review protocol
The methods outlined below are specific to maintaining the review as a living systematic review on the Cochrane Library (1). They will
be used immediately upon publication of this update. Core review methods, such as the criteria for considering studies in the review
and assessment of risk of bias, are unchanged. As such, below we outline only those areas of the Methods for which additional activities
or rules apply.
Search methods for identification of studies
We will re-run electronic database and trial registry searches monthly. For the electronic databases (CENTRAL, Epub Ahead of Print,
In-Process & Other Non-Indexed Citations, MEDLINE Daily and MEDLINE and Embase) and other electronic sources (WHO
International Clinical Trials Registry Platform and clinicaltrials.gov), we will set up auto-alerts (where possible) to deliver a monthly
search yield by email.
We will search other resources (articles published in three relevant international peer reviewed journals: Journal of Nutrition Education
and Behavior, Public Health Nutrition, and Journal of the Academy of Nutrition and Dietetics; database of published dissertations; and
grey literature in GoogleScholar) manually every six months.
As additional steps to inform the living systematic review, we will contact corresponding authors of ongoing studies as they are identified
and ask them to advise when results are available, or to share early or unpublished data. We will contact the corresponding authors
of any newly-included studies for advice about other relevant studies. We will conduct citation tracking of included studies in Web
of Science Core Collection on an ongoing basis. For that purpose, we have set up citation alerts in Web of Science Core Collection.
We will manually screen the reference list of any newly-included studies and systematic reviews. Also, we will use the ’related citation’
feature in PubMed to identify additional articles.
We will review search methods and strategies approximately yearly, to ensure they reflect any terminology changes in the topic area, or
in the databases.
Selection of studies
We will immediately screen any new citations retrieved by the monthly searches. As the first step of monthly screening, we will apply the
machine learning classifier (RCT model) (Wallace 2017) available in the Cochrane Register of Studies (CRS-Web) (Cochrane 2017a).
The classifier assigns a probability (from 0 to 100) to each citation for being a true randomised controlled trial (RCT). For citations
that are assigned a probability score of less than 10, the machine learning classifier currently has a specificity/recall of 99.987% (Wallace
2017). We will screen citations assigned a score from 10 to 100 in duplicate and independently. Cochrane Crowd (Cochrane 2017b)
will screen citations that score 9 or less. Any citations that are deemed to be potential RCTs by Cochrane Crowd will be returned to
the authors for screening.
Data synthesis
Whenever we find new evidence (i.e. studies, data or information) meeting the review inclusion criteria, we will extract the data, assess
risk of bias and incorporate it in the synthesis every three months, as appropriate.
We will incorporate any new study data into existing meta-analyses using the standard approaches outlined in the Data synthesis section.
Sensitivity analysis
We will not adjust the meta-analyses to account for multiple testing, given that the methods related to frequent updating of meta-
analyses are under development (Simmonds (in press)).
Other
We will consider the review scope and methods if appropriate in light of potential changes in the topic area, or the evidence being
included in the review (e.g. additional comparisons, interventions or outcomes, or new review methods available).
The review is being piloted as a living systematic review up until March 2018.

There is very low-quality evidence that specific child-
feeding practice interventions increase the consump-
tion of vegetables amongst children aged five years and
under. There is very low-quality evidence that parent
nutrition education interventions and multicompo-
nent interventions respectively may not be effective in
increasing fruit and vegetable consumption of children
aged five and under

• Consistent with the original review (Wolfenden 2012), we excluded trials if fruit or vegetable intake was not the primary trial
outcome, to avoid potential confounding effects of other interventions and reduce the risk of publication bias and selective outcome
reporting which is more predominate among secondary trial outcomes (or outcomes that were not otherwise stated). This included
trials where fruit and vegetable outcomes were assessed within broader targeted interventions. The protocol stated that trials listing
fruit and vegetable intake as a secondary trial outcome would also be included. We included trials that did not state a primary
outcome, but did report intake of fruit or vegetables or both. We conducted sensitivity analyses to explore the impact on the overall
assessment of treatment effects, excluding studies that did not state a primary outcome of children’s fruit and vegetable consumption.
• Consistent with the original review (Wolfenden 2012), we amended classification of intervention effects as ’short-term’ from
’three to less than 12 months’ in the protocol to less than 12 months in the review.
• Consistent with the original review (Wolfenden 2012), we did not contact professional associations as part of the review search
strategy, nor did we search the National Institute of Health Randomized Trial Records Database.
• Consistent with the original review (Wolfenden 2012), we amended the title and text throughout the review to ensure consistent
terminology for the description of age. Specifically, we replaced the age description of children as ’preschool’ with a more precise
description of ’children aged five years and under’, to more accurately reflect the scope of the review. We refer only to preschools when
discussing the findings of trials conducted in that setting.
• Consistent with the original review (Wolfenden 2012), as some trials included children across a range of ages, we included any
trial where the mean age of the sample at baseline was five years or under.
• For the review update, while two independent reviewers extracted data from each study, the extraction was undertaken by pairs
of reviewers.
• For the review update, risk of bias was assessed on published study information and authors of included studies were not
contacted to clarify any aspects.
• For the review update, we did not conduct planned subgroup analyses by interventions of varying intensities, due to insufficient
information being reported across the included studies about the number and duration of intervention contacts or components.
• For the review update, while articles were screened independently against all pre-specified eligibility criteria by two reviewers,
this was not conducted in a sequential manner (that is by order: participants, outcome, comparator, intervention, study type) as
adopted in the original review.
• Whilst not explicitly excluded from the original review, for the review update we specifically considered cross-over trials to be an
eligible study design. This was due to the many trials that adopt this design to investigate the effectiveness of interventions to increase
the fruit and vegetable consumption of children aged five years and under, and the review authors deeming the study design to be
appropriate in this context.
• This update includes some new methods relevant for living systematic reviews, which are included in the Methods and also
described in Appendix 3
