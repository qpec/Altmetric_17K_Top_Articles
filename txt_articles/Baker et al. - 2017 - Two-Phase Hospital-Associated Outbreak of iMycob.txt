Background. Nontuberculous mycobacteria (NTM) commonly colonize municipal water supplies and cause healthcare-associ-
ated outbreaks. We investigated a biphasic outbreak of Mycobacterium abscessus at a tertiary care hospital.
Methods. Case patients had recent hospital exposure and laboratory-confirmed colonization or infection with M. abscessus from 
January 2013 through December 2015. We conducted a multidisciplinary epidemiologic, field, and laboratory investigation.
Results. The incidence rate of M. abscessus increased from 0.7 cases per 10 000 patient-days during the baseline period (January 
2013–July 2013) to 3.0 cases per 10 000 patient-days during phase 1 of the outbreak (August 2013–May 2014) (incidence rate ratio, 
4.6 [95% confidence interval, 2.3–8.8]; P < .001). Thirty-six of 71 (51%) phase 1 cases were lung transplant patients with positive 
respiratory cultures. We eliminated tap water exposure to the aerodigestive tract among high-risk patients, and the incidence rate 
decreased to baseline. Twelve of 24 (50%) phase 2 (December 2014–June 2015) cases occurred in cardiac surgery patients with inva-
sive infections. Phase 2 resolved after we implemented an intensified disinfection protocol and used sterile water for heater-cooler 
units of cardiopulmonary bypass machines. Molecular fingerprinting of clinical isolates identified 2 clonal strains of M. abscessus; 1 
clone was isolated from water sources at a new hospital addition. We made several water engineering interventions to improve water 
flow and increase disinfectant levels.
Conclusions. We investigated and mitigated a 2-phase clonal outbreak of M. abscessus linked to hospital tap water. Healthcare 
facilities with endemic NTM should consider similar tap water avoidance and engineering strategies to decrease risk of NTM 
infection.
Keywords. hospital outbreak; nontuberculous mycobacteria; Mycobacterium abscessus; infection control; hospital water safety.
Nontuberculous mycobacteria (NTM) are hardy environmental 
microorganisms found in water, dust, and soil [1]. NTM commonly 
colonize municipal water [2–4], including tap water at healthcare 
facilities [5–9], and form biofilms in water distribution systems [10].
Outbreaks of Mycobacterium abscessus and other rapidly growing 
mycobacteria are common and have been associated with colonized 
plumbing systems in commercial buildings [11, 12] and healthcare 
facilities [13–16]. Organisms belonging to the Mycobacterium 
abscessus complex (M. abscessus subspecies abscessus, M. absces-
sus subspecies massiliense, and M. abscessus subspecies bolletii) are 
intrinsically resistant to many antibiotics and disinfectants [17]. 
Infections due to M. abscessus are difficult to diagnose and typically 
require months of therapy using multiple antibiotics [18, 19].
In March 2014, we identified an increase in patients with 
positive cultures for M. abscessus. Most patients had positive 
respiratory tract cultures, including numerous positive bron-
choalveolar lavage (BAL) cultures from lung transplant recip-
ients. We undertook a multifaceted investigation to confirm 
cases, identify sources, and implement mitigation strategies.
METHODS
Study Setting
Duke University Hospital (DUH) is a 957-bed tertiary care 
hospital located in North Carolina. A new hospital addition 
containing 160 intensive care unit (ICU) and intermediate 
beds, as well as 16 operating suites, was opened for patient care 
in late July 2013. The original portions of DUH continued to be 
used for patient care, predominantly for non-ICU medical and 
surgical patients after July 2013. DUH utilizes the municipal 
water supply.

 Outbreak of Mycobacterium abscessus • CID 2017:64 (1 April) • 903
The Duke University Institutional Review Board approved 
this investigation and research.
Epidemiologic Investigation
We identified all patients with growth of M. abscessus from any 
clinical specimen obtained at the hospital from January 2013 
through December 2015. All patients with a first-time positive 
culture were considered cases with the following exceptions: 
Patients with a culture obtained during the first 2 days of admis-
sion or from a DUH outpatient clinic were excluded unless they 
had previously been hospitalized at DUH within 30 days prior to 
culture collection. After retrospective case finding was completed 
for the period from January 2013 through February 2014, we pro-
spectively applied the same case definition for detection of inci-
dent cases from March 2014 through December 2015. Relevant 
clinical data were abstracted from the electronic medical record.
Field Investigation
We investigated the environment, equipment, and practices used 
in the bronchoscopy suite [20, 21] and the clinical microbiology 
laboratory [22, 23] to exclude a pseudo-outbreak. Subsequently, 
based on characteristics of case patients, we investigated addi-
tional locations of the healthcare facility, including ICUs and 
operating rooms (ORs) in the new addition, to identify poten-
tial environmental sources of M. abscessus where exposure to 
this organism was considered possible.
We conducted a comprehensive survey of the existing and 
new hospital addition’s water systems [24]. This survey included 
a water flow analysis to identify potential locations with reduced 
or restricted water flow, reduced disinfectant levels, or cooling 
within the hot water distribution system.
We performed mycobacterial cultures of biofilms [10] from 
water outlets and equipment in the hospital, as well as from 
water outlets in the community surrounding the hospital 
(Supplementary Table). We also performed air-sampling exper-
iments in ORs to evaluate for aerosolized particles containing 
NTM [25].
Laboratory Methods
Standard mycobacterial culture methods were utilized (see 
page 3 of the Supplementary Data) [2, 26]. All environmental 
and selected patient isolates of M. abscessus were identified to 
subspecies and typed using erythromycin ribosomal methylase 
[erm(41)] [27] and region V RNA polymerase subunit beta (rpoβ) 
[28] gene sequencing. Variable number tandem repeats (VNTRs) 
[29] and pulsed-field gel electrophoresis (PFGE) [30] were also 
performed on representative environmental and patient isolates.
Statistical Analysis
Incidence rate ratios (IRRs) were estimated using maxi-
mum likelihood, assuming the number of cases followed the 
Poisson distribution. Wald 95% confidence intervals (CIs) 
were calculated, and likelihood ratio χ2 tests were used to 
compare incidence rates. Calculations were performed in SAS 
software, version 9.4 (SAS Institute, Cary, North Carolina).
RESULTS
Outbreak Investigation, Phase 1: August 2013–May 2014
Epidemiologic Investigation
Ten cases of M. abscessus were detected over 150 651 patient-
days during the preoutbreak baseline period from January 
2013 through July 2013; 71 cases were identified over 234 956 
patient-days from August 2013 through May 2014 (phase 
1) (Figure 1A). Thus, the incidence rate increased from a base-
line of 0.7 cases per 10 000 patient-days to 3.0 cases per 10 000 
patient-days (IRR, 4.6 [95% CI, 2.3–8.8]; P < .001).
Lung transplant recipients represented 39 of 71 (55%) cases 
during phase 1 (Table 1). Other cases included patients with 
recent cardiac surgery (n = 9 [13%]), cancer (n = 5 [7%]), and 
hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (n = 5 [7%]), as well as 
multiple other patient types (n = 13 [18%]). Sixty-nine (97%) 
patients had exposure to the new hospital addition within 
30 days prior to the first positive culture.
Mycobacterium abscessus was initially recovered from the 
respiratory tract in 56 (79%) phase 1 cases, including 36 of 39 
(92%) lung transplant recipients. Thirty-five of 36 (97%) res-
piratory isolates from lung transplant recipients were recovered 
from BAL cultures. The median time from lung transplantation 
to first positive M. abscessus culture was 13 days (interquartile 
range [IQR], 6–47 days; range, 0–4716 days).
Thirty-six of 71 (51%) patients who met the case definition 
during phase 1 received antimicrobial therapy for infections, 
and 17 (24%) patients died within 60 days of the first positive 
culture.
Field Investigation
Phase 1 of the outbreak temporally correlated with the opening 
of the new hospital addition (Figure 1B). The predominance 
of respiratory isolates suggested that colonization or infection 
occurred via exposure through the aerodigestive tract, likely 
from routine care practices using tap water. Investigation of 
bronchoscopy equipment, the endoscope reprocessing suite, 
microbiology laboratory, and lung and cardiac surgery ORs 
revealed no source of the outbreak.
Environmental cultures obtained in April and May 2014 
from biofilms of water sources were positive for NTM in 19 of 
24 (79%) locations at the new hospital addition, 14 of 25 (56%) 
sites at the existing hospital, and 5 of 12 (42%) locations in the 
community surrounding the hospital (Supplementary Table). 
Only cultures taken from biofilms of water sources at the hospi-
tal addition were positive for M. abscessus, with 12 of 24 (50%) 
sites positive for M. abscessus subspecies abscessus. Sites testing 
positive for M. abscessus included patient room faucets, patient 
care ice machines, ICU hallway water faucets, a patient room

shower head, a utility room water basin, and an OR scrub sink 
faucet.
Interventions and Subsequent Surveillance
Based on data from the field investigation, we developed and 
implemented a sterile water protocol in May 2014 that ulti-
mately included all lung and heart transplant recipients, ICU 
patients, and patients with disrupted gastrointestinal tracts. 
These patients received sterile water instead of tap water for oral 
care, speech therapy assessments, enteral tube flushes, respira-
tory therapy, consumption, and, until surgical sites were well-
healed, bathing. New lung and heart transplant recipients also 
continued tap water avoidance after hospital discharge in the 
early postoperative period.
We noted an overall decrease in M. abscessus cases, includ-
ing cases among lung transplant recipients, during the period 
from June 2014 through November 2014 (Figure 1B). The over-
all incidence rate decreased from 3.0 to 1.0 cases per 10 000

some cases occurred months after date of suspected patient inoculation. In particular, cardiac surgery cases that were identified after the 9 May 2015 heater-cooler unit disin-
fection protocol changes were either linked to cardiac surgeries performed before these protocol changes (n = 3) or were thought to be unrelated to the cardiac surgery (n = 1).

to 0.6 cases per 10 000 patient-days (IRR, 0.3 [95% CI, .2–.7]; 
P = .005).
Outbreak Investigation, Phase 2: December 2014–June 2015
Epidemiologic Investigation
Two patients who had recently undergone cardiac surgery had 
cultures collected in December 2014 that returned positive 
for M. abscessus. These cases led to a second epidemiological 
investigation that ultimately included a cluster of 13 cases 
among patients who had undergone recent cardiac surgery at 
the hospital and had positive cultures from December 2014 
through June 2015 (phase 2) (Figure 1B). One case reflected 
respiratory colonization, but the remaining 12 (92%) patients 
developed extrapulmonary invasive disease.
We analyzed the cohort of all cardiac surgery patients who 
met the case definition over the entire 3-year study period. 
Twenty-two cases of extrapulmonary invasive M. abscessus 
infection occurred after cardiac surgery. The first invasive

infection was identified in November 2013. Infections followed 
heart transplant (n = 8 [36%]), ventricular assist device (VAD) 
insertion (n = 8 [36%]), valve replacement (n = 4 [18%]), and 
coronary artery bypass grafting (CABG) (n = 2 [9%]) surgeries. 
Sites of initial positive cultures included bloodstream (n = 10 
[45%]), sternal wound (n = 5 [23%]), VAD driveline site (n = 2 
[9%]), pleural fluid (n = 2 [9%]), respiratory tract (n = 2 [9%]), 
and pelvic ascites (n = 1 [5%]). Three additional cardiac surgery 
patients with invasive infections did not meet the case defini-
tion because they had not been hospitalized within 30 days 
prior to initial culture collection.
Twenty-one of 22 (95%) patients from this cardiac surgery 
cohort required cardiopulmonary bypass (CPB) during sur-
gery; the remaining patient underwent chest exploration with 
a CPB machine on standby in the OR. Median incubation time 
from possible inoculation in the OR to first positive nonrespira-
tory culture was 42 days (IQR, 20–94 days; range, 2–366 days). 
Nearly all cardiac surgeries performed after July 2013, including 
all cardiac surgeries performed in this cohort, occurred in ORs 
in the hospital addition.
All 22 cardiac surgery patients had extensive perioperative 
comorbidities and complicated postoperative courses in addi-
tion to M. abscessus infection. Nineteen (86%) patients received 
antimicrobial therapy, and 9 (41%) died within 60 days of the 
first positive culture.
Field Investigation
We reinvestigated lung and cardiac surgery OR suites and sur-
gical practices. Mycobacterial cultures from cardiothoracic 
surgery OR air samples were negative. We also reviewed our 
maintenance and disinfection protocol for heater-cooler units 
(HCUs) of CPB machines. Our hospital used Stöckert 3T HCUs, 
and the manufacturer’s instructions for use changed in 2010, 
recommending filtered rather than unfiltered tap water for 
use in these machines; however, we found that water changes 
were performed with unfiltered tap water and that the disin-
fection procedure was not performed according to the instruc-
tions for use. Cultures from biofilms of HCUs were negative for 
M. abscessus, but a culture from a biofilm of the faucet used to 
fill HCUs was positive for M. abscessus. Only a single series of 
cultures from biofilms of external HCU components, includ-
ing tubing and overflow water canisters, was performed before 
we instituted a new water change and disinfection protocol for 
HCUs, as described below.
Our survey of the hospital water system identified several 
factors that may have contributed to increased concentra-
tions of M. abscessus within the new addition’s water distribu-
tion system. The addition utilized Leadership in Energy and 
Environmental Design (LEED) standards to reduce water usage 
[31]. The water system had low flow rates and low residual dis-
infectant (chloramine) levels at multiple water outlets. The hot 
water system was a recirculating loop, and hot water stored 
in reservoirs required prolonged flow times to reach outlets. 
Relatively small amounts of water from the municipal water 
supply entered the recirculating hot water loop each day, which 
also contributed to low chloramine levels.
Interventions and Subsequent Surveillance
We made several process, patient care, and water engineer-
ing changes to terminate the outbreak among cardiac surgery 
patients and prevent new clusters among other patient types 
(Supplementary Figure 2).
A study published in the midst of our investigation demon-
strated the potential for aerosolized NTM from CPB machine 
HCUs to contaminate patients during cardiac surgery [25]. In 
early May 2015, based on the results of this study and our epi-
demiologic investigation, we changed our protocol for main-
tenance and disinfection of HCUs. The new protocol included 
daily water changes with sterile water and daily disinfection 
with hydrogen peroxide, in addition to intermittent bleach-
based disinfection. We also directed HCU exhaust away from 
the surgical field. We replaced all existing HCUs with new 
HCUs by early June 2015 and used only sterile water in these 
machines. Also in early June, we notified at-risk patients and 
healthcare providers of the potential for NTM infection after 
cardiac surgery and described associated signs and symptoms 
to facilitate case detection. At the same time, we notified the 
US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) about the potential 
causal link between HCU use and NTM infection.
We implemented 3 primary water engineering–related inter-
ventions at the new addition to reduce microbial proliferation 
and burden: we flushed water throughout both the cold water 
and recirculating hot water systems; removed or adjusted 
water flow restrictors, aerators, and a redundant hot water 
tank; and decreased the percentage of recirculating hot water 
that bypassed heat exchangers. These changes led to higher 
and more consistent flow rates, increased mixing of municipal 
water within the hot water loop, faster delivery of hot water to 
distal outlets, and increased chloramine levels throughout the 
plumbing system. Additionally, we installed point-of-use 0.2-
µm water filters [32] at OR scrub sink faucets.
A single case of M. abscessus infection occurred in a car-
diac surgery patient who underwent CPB after implementa-
tion of HCU protocol changes and engineering interventions 
(Figure 1B). This patient developed M. abscessus infection of 
pelvic ascites after CABG, and we suspected that inoculation 
did not occur at the time of CABG.
Laboratory Investigation, Phase 1 and Phase 2
Seventy case patient and 17 environmental isolates of M. absces-
sus recovered during the study period were submitted for 
erm(41) gene sequencing, region V rpoβ gene sequencing, 
and/or VNTR. All but 2 patient isolates and all environmental

isolates analyzed belonged to 1 of 2 clones (see page 5 of the 
Supplementary Data).
Fifty-three of 70 (76%) patient isolates were consistent with 
clone A; 15 (21%) isolates were consistent with clone B; and only 
2 (3%) isolates were inconsistent with either clone (Table 2). 
All 18 patient isolates analyzed from cardiac surgery patients 
with invasive infections and all 17 environmental isolates of 
M. abscessus exhibited clone A fingerprinting patterns.
We additionally performed gene sequencing and VNTR on 
patient isolates collected prior to the study period. Isolates with 
clone A and clone B fingerprinting were identified as early as 
2010 and 2007, respectively.
PFGE was performed on 9 clone A patient isolates collected 
from 2010 through 2015 and 8 clone A environmental isolates from 
phase 1 of this investigation; all isolates were clonal (Figure 2A) [30]. 
PFGE was also performed on 10 clone B patient isolates collected 
from 2007 through 2015, and 9 isolates were clonal (Figure 2B).
DISCUSSION
We report a biphasic outbreak of M. abscessus in patients hospi-
talized at a tertiary care hospital.
Cases from phase 1 of the outbreak predominantly involved 
lung transplant recipients with colonization or infection of the 
respiratory tract. We hypothesized that micro-aspiration of 
M. abscessus from tap water used for patient care activities led 
to subsequent pulmonary colonization or infection [33, 34].
The second phase of the outbreak primarily involved cardiac 
surgery patients with invasive infections. Based on reports of 
NTM infections in cardiac surgery patients and the prevalence 
of wound and bloodstream infections, we hypothesized that 
patients in this second cluster acquired infection via aerosols 
generated from colonized HCUs [25].
One of the 2 distinct molecular clones of M. abscessus involved 
in this outbreak was recovered from tap water sources at the new 
hospital addition; however, both clones were present in clinical 
cases that occurred several years before the addition opened. Also, 
both M. abscessus clones were isolated from patients who had 
never been admitted to the hospital. Thus, isolates of M. abscessus 
obtained from this investigation were not unique to the new addi-
tion, the existing hospital, or the study time period and likely rep-
resent colonization of the local municipal water supply.
Low flow rates within the hospital addition’s water circuit 
and a redundant hot water circulation system may have led to

aAn isolate was considered consistent with clone A if it had a C→T mutation at base pair 207 of the rpoβ gene or VNTR with 5 copies for primer TR155. All isolates from cases meeting 1 
of these criteria that underwent erm(41) gene sequencing had the M. abscessus subspecies abscessus type VI erm(41) gene.
bAn isolate was considered consistent with clone B if it had an M. abscessus subspecies M. massiliense erm(41) gene. All isolates from cases meeting this criterion that underwent rpoβ 
gene sequencing had the M. abscessus subspecies abscessus rpoβ gene.
cAll isolates with gene sequencing not consistent with clone A or clone B were considered “other” M. abscessus isolates.
dPatient isolates included met the outbreak case definition and represented either M. abscessus colonization or infection. Only selected case patient isolates underwent molecular 
fingerprinting.
ePhase 1 of the outbreak occurred from August 2013 through May 2014. Phase 2 occurred from December 2014 through June 2015.

amplification of NTM in the addition’s water supply over time. 
These conditions contributed to low chloramine levels and 
water temperatures favorable for M. abscessus growth.
Our initial mitigation strategy eliminated exposure to tap 
water for high-risk patients via a protocol that used only ster-
ile water for clinical care practices. We observed a sustained 
decrease in the incidence rate of M. abscessus obtained from 
pulmonary sources after this intervention. Then, after a second 
cluster of cases occurred in patients after cardiac surgery, we 
purchased new HCUs, intensified the HCU disinfection proto-
col, and began using only sterile water for HCU water changes. 
Subsequently, the outbreak among cardiac surgery patients 
resolved.
We also implemented water engineering–related mitigation 
strategies designed to decrease the burden of M. abscessus in 
the hospital water supply (Table 3). Complete eradication of 
M. abscessus and associated biofilms from hospital tap water 
and plumbing infrastructure was not realistic given the envi-
ronmental persistence of NTM [32]. Nonetheless, engineering 
interventions should decrease risk of patient colonization if tap 
water exposure occurs despite avoidance strategies.
Other recent outbreaks of postoperative invasive NTM infec-
tions traced to the use of CPB and Stöckert 3T HCUs have 
received widespread attention. Sax et al investigated an outbreak 
of Mycobacterium chimaera at a Swiss hospital among cardiac 
surgery patients that was molecularly linked to colonized HCUs 
[25, 39]. Hospitals in Europe, Pennsylvania, and Iowa have 
also reported M. chimaera infections following cardiac surgery 
[40–43]. Whole genome sequencing performed on M. chimaera 
isolates from 11 patients and 5 Stöckert 3T HCUs from hospi-
tals in Pennsylvania and Iowa suggested point-source contam-
ination [44], which may have occurred at the manufacturing 
site in Germany [45]. The FDA and Centers for Disease Control 
and Prevention released updated safety recommendations in 
October 2016 that advised avoidance of 3T HCU devices man-
ufactured prior to September 2014 and notification of patients 
who had been exposed to these devices [36, 46].
Data from our investigation do not conclusively prove that 
aerosolization of M. abscessus from colonized HCUs caused 
invasive infections in cardiac surgery patients; however, we 
believe this mechanism provides the most likely explanation 
for these infections (see page 5 of the Supplementary Data). 
Infections in cardiac surgery patients at our hospital most likely 
arose from M. abscessus present in the hospital water supply 
that in turn colonized HCUs. In contrast, outbreaks of M. chi-
maera in cardiac surgery patients at multiple other hospitals 
worldwide likely stemmed from point-source contamination in 
Germany [44, 45].
This outbreak and investigation has important implications 
for other medical centers (Table 3). First, NTM are often pres-
ent in hospital water, and factors that increase their concen-
tration or promote aerosolization onto vulnerable patients

A, Isolates selected for this panel demonstrated gene sequencing and/or variable 
number tandem repeats (VNTRs) consistent with outbreak clone A [erm(41) gene: 
subspecies abscessus, type VI; rpoβ gene: subspecies abscessus, C→T mutation 
at base pair 207; VNTR: primer TR155, 5 copies]. The panel includes 2 preoutbreak 
patient isolates from 2010–2012 (lanes 1, 2), 4 case patient isolates from phase 1 
of the outbreak period (lanes 3, 4, 5, 6), 2 case patient isolates from phase 2 of the 
outbreak period (lanes 7, 9), 1 patient isolate from the outbreak period that did not 
meet the case definition (lane 8), 1 environmental isolate from phase 1 (lane 10), 
and the M. abscessus subspecies abscessus type strain—ATCC19977T (lane 11). 
The 9 patient isolates included samples from bronchoalveolar lavage (n = 5), blood 
(n = 1), pleural fluid (n = 1), sputum (n = 1), and sternal wound (n = 1). All clinical 
and environmental isolates (lanes 1–10) were clonal [30]. Isolates were indistin-
guishable or closely related except isolate 8 (possibly related), and all 10 isolates 
were unrelated to the M. abscessus subspecies abscessus type strain (lane 11). 
Seven additional environmental isolates from phase 1 were also indistinguishable 
(data not shown). B, Isolates selected for this panel demonstrated gene sequenc-
ing consistent with outbreak clone B [erm(41) gene: subspecies massiliense; rpoβ 
gene: subspecies abscessus]. The panel includes 4 preoutbreak patient isolates 
from 2007 through 2013 (lanes 1, 2, 3, 4), 3 case patient isolates from phase 1 
of the outbreak period (lanes 5, 6, 7), 1 case patient isolate from phase 2 of the 
outbreak period (lane 9), 2 patient isolates from the outbreak period that did not 
meet the case definition (lanes 8, 10), and the M. abscessus subspecies massiliense 
type strain—CIP108297T (lane 11). The 10 patient isolates included samples from 
bronchoalveolar lavage (n = 4), blood (n = 2), pleural fluid (n = 2), soft tissue (n = 1), 
and sputum (n = 1). All patient isolates (lanes 1–10) except isolate 10 were clonal 
[30]. Patient isolates other than isolate 10 were indistinguishable or closely related 
except isolates 1 and 9 (possibly related). Isolate 6 had poor image resolution but 
appeared related. All 10 isolates were unrelated to the M. abscessus subspecies 
massiliense type strain (lane 11).

 Outbreak of Mycobacterium abscessus • CID 2017:64 (1 April) • 909
can produce outbreaks. Second, long-term surveillance for 
NTM by healthcare facilities is critical for outbreak detec-
tion. NTM surveillance is difficult and can be complicated by 
preexisting endemic disease in the community with the same 
NTM strains, atypical clinical manifestations, and prolonged 
incubation periods. Third, strategies that minimize exposure 
of vulnerable patients to waterborne NTM can successfully 
mitigate outbreaks; however, multiple or unexpected types of 
exposures may occur. Therefore, in response to outbreaks, we 
recommend combining water avoidance strategies with water 
engineering–based interventions designed to decrease the 
concentration of NTM colonizing healthcare facility water or 
equipment. We found that redundant water systems designed 
to conserve water may create low-flow states and contrib-
ute to NTM proliferation within hospital plumbing systems. 
Indications and methods for screening healthcare facility 
water systems for NTM to help prevent outbreaks need to be 
developed.
This investigation had limitations. The case definition did not 
differentiate colonization from invasive infection because of the 
inherent difficulties in making this clinical distinction, espe-
cially in lung transplant patients. Also, our investigation did not 
capture infected patients with negative cultures, no cultures, or 
those who did not return to our hospital for follow-up. In addi-
tion, while many patients died, we cannot state that these deaths 
were attributable to M. abscessus infection, in part because 
many patients were critically ill with multiple comorbidities 
in addition to M. abscessus infection. Finally, to protect subse-
quent patients, we implemented an HCU disinfection protocol 
prior to confirming a microbiological link between colonized 
HCUs and invasive M. abscessus infections following cardiac 
surgery. The limited number of HCU cultures and low sensi-
tivity of environmental culture techniques for NTM [2] could 
explain our inability to microbiologically confirm HCU coloni-
zation with M. abscessus.
In summary, we utilized a multidisciplinary team to inves-
tigate and mitigate a hospital-associated outbreak of clonally 
related M. abscessus that was epidemiologically linked to col-
onized tap water. We made multiple patient care and water 
engineering interventions. Primary interventions included 
institution of an inpatient sterile water protocol for high-risk 
patients, implementation of a protocol for enhanced disinfec-
tion and sterile water use for HCUs of CPB machines, and water 
engineering changes designed to decrease NTM burden in the 
plumbing system. Other healthcare facilities, particularly those 
with endemic NTM or newly constructed patient care facilities, 
Table 3. Selected Interventions Made and Recommendations for Other Healthcare Facilities to Decrease Risk of Healthcare-Associated Nontuberculous 
Mycobacterial Infection
Intervention Made at Our Hospital
Recommendations for Other Healthcare Facilities
Clinical practice and equipment-related interventions
 Sterile water use for direct patient-care activities of 
patients at risk
• Healthcare facilities with infections from NTM should consider avoidance of tap water 
[35] and use of sterile water for patient care activities, such as oral care, enteral tube 
flushing, speech assessment, consumption, and bathing.
• Local epidemiology should determine target patient groups, potentially including critically 
ill and immunosuppressed patients, those with disrupted gastrointestinal tracts, and 
patients with early postoperative wounds. Continuing to avoid tap water after hospital 
discharge may also reduce risk for recent lung or heart transplant recipients.
 HCU sterile water use and disinfection protocol
• Hospitals should adhere to FDA and manufacturer recommendations for HCU use, water 
changes, and disinfection practices [36, 37].
 Epidemiologic and clinical surveillance for NTM 
infection
• Hospital epidemiologists should perform retrospective and prospective surveillance for 
invasive NTM infections.
• Clinicians should consider NTM infection when evaluating patients with infection after 
cardiac surgery, especially for atypical clinical manifestations and prolonged incubation 
periods.
• Clinicians should request mycobacterial cultures, particularly for surgical specimens.
Environmental and engineering-based interventions
 Periodic flushing of both cold water and recirculating 
hot water; removal of flow restrictors and  
redundancies in plumbing system
• Facilities with high-efficiency and/or recirculating water systems should consult with water engi-
neering experts about periodically flushing stagnant or recirculating water from the circulation, 
avoiding or removing flow restrictors, and minimizing redundancies in the plumbing system.
 Monitoring of hot water temperatures and flow times 
to water outlets
• Water engineering personnel should perform surveillance of hot water temperatures 
throughout the hot water distribution system [38].
 Monitoring of chloramine levels in hospital water 
supply
• Water engineering personnel should measure disinfectant (eg, chloramine or chorine) 
levels at entry to the facility and at point of use. If proximal disinfectant levels are low, 
healthcare facilities may need to contract with municipal water authorities.
 Installation of point-of-use water filters in clinical 
locations
• Facilities with endemic NTM should consider use of 0.2-µm point-of-use water filters [32].
 Mycobacterial cultures of biofilms obtained from  
hospital water outlets
• If facilities experience outbreaks of NTM, they should evaluate the water system and 
associated equipment for NTM colonization.
