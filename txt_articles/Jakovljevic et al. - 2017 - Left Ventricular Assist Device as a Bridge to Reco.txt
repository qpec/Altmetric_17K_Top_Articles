ABSTRACT
BACKGROUND Left ventricular assist devices (LVADs) have been used as an effective therapeutic option in patients
with advanced heart failure, either as a bridge to transplantation, as destination therapy, or in some patients, as a bridge
to recovery.
OBJECTIVES This study evaluated whether patients undergoing an LVAD bridge-to-recovery protocol can achieve
cardiac and physical functional capacities equivalent to those of healthy controls.
METHODS Fifty-eight male patients—18 implanted with a continuous-flow LVAD, 16 patients with LVAD explanted
(recovered patients), and 24 heart transplant candidates (HTx)—and 97 healthy controls performed a maximal graded
cardiopulmonary exercise test with continuous measurements of respiratory gas exchange and noninvasive (rebreathing)
hemodynamic data. Cardiac function was represented by peak exercise cardiac power output (mean arterial blood
pressure � cardiac output) and functional capacity by peak exercise O2 consumption.
RESULTS All patients demonstrated a significant exertional effort as demonstrated with the mean peak exercise
respiratory exchange ratio >1.10. Peak exercise cardiac power output was significantly higher in healthy
controls and explanted LVAD patients compared with other patients (healthy 5.35 � 0.95 W; explanted 3.45 �
0.72 W; LVAD implanted 2.37 � 0.68 W; and HTx 1.31 � 0.31 W; p < 0.05), as was peak O2 consumption
(healthy 36.4 � 10.3 ml/kg/min; explanted 29.8 � 5.9 ml/kg/min; implanted 20.5 � 4.3 ml/kg/min; and HTx
12.0 � 2.2 ml/kg/min; p < 0.05). In the LVAD explanted group, 38% of the patients achieved peak cardiac power
output and 69% achieved peak O2 consumption within the ranges of healthy controls.
CONCLUSIONS The authors have shown that a substantial number of patients who recovered sufficiently to
allow explantation of their LVAD can even achieve cardiac and physical functional capacities nearly equivalent to
those of healthy controls. (J Am Coll Cardiol 2017;69:1924–33) © 2017 The Authors. Published by Elsevier on

eart transplantation is the gold standard
treatment
for
patients
with
advanced
heart failure resistant to medical therapy.
Because demand exceeds the availability of donor
hearts, the use of mechanical circulatory support
and
left
ventricular
assist
devices
(LVADs)
has
emerged
as
an
alternative
form
of
therapy
for
such patients (1). LVADs have been used as an
effective
therapeutic
option
in
patients
with
advanced heart failure, either as a bridge to trans-
plantation,
as
destination
therapy,
or
in
some
patients, as a bridge to recovery (2,3). Improvement
in myocyte histology and biochemistry, as well as
in left ventricular anatomy, physiology, and hemo-
dynamics,
has
been
observed
in
patients
with
advanced
heart
failure
receiving
prolonged
me-
chanical circulatory support (4,5). It has also been
demonstrated that the use of LVADs improves the
rate
of
survival,
quality
of
life,
and
functional
capacity in patients with advanced heart failure
(6–10). LVADs provide cardiac function, not only
at rest, but also during exercise in patients with
severe heart failure (11–14).
The improvement in cardiac function of implan-
ted LVAD patients may be such that the pump could
be removed and transplantation avoided with good
long-term outcomes (15–19). Sufficient recovery to
allow device explantation has been observed in only
5% to 24% of patients (19–23). However, a strategy
of
combining
mechanical
and
pharmacological
therapy may enhance further myocardial recovery
and allow the device to be safely explanted in
a
larger
proportion
of
LVAD
implanted
patients
(24–27).
The
explanted
LVAD
patients
demonstrate
improved quality of life, cardiac performance, and
exercise performance several years following device
removal (3,12,18,28). However, to what extent the
explanted LVAD patients can restore their cardiac
and physical function remains unknown. Therefore,
in the present study, we tested the hypothesis that
patients
whose
LVAD
was
explanted
due
to
myocardial recovery using such protocols can ach-
ieve
cardiac
and
physical
functional
capacities
equivalent to those of healthy controls.
METHODS
STUDY DESIGN. This was a cross-sectional,
observational study in which cardiac and
respiratory
measurements
at
rest
and
in
response to maximal graded cardiopulmo-
nary exercise testing were compared among
the 4 groups: 1) heart transplant candidates;
2)
LVAD
implanted
patients
(on
LVAD
support);
3) LVAD explanted patients; and 4) healthy controls.
The LVAD implanted and LVAD explanted groups
were consecutive patients subject to our previous
investigations (12,18,26,27).
STUDY PARTICIPANTS. The study population con-
sisted
of
58
male
patients—16
LVAD
explanted
(recovered) patients, 18 LVAD implanted, and 24 heart
transplant candidates (HTx)—and 97 healthy controls
with no known cardiovascular diseases. Exclusion
criteria included inability to perform treadmill exer-
cise tests, inability to exercise beyond anaerobic
threshold, symptomatic angina limiting exercise, and
unwillingness to provide a consent form.
The majority of LVAD explanted patients (87%)
were in New York Heart Association (NYHA) func-
tional class I, and 13% were in NYHA functional class
II. Left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) ranged
from 50% to 72%. The mean period of LVAD support
was 396 days, with a range of 22 to 638 days. The
explantation was considered if the following criteria
were met while the LVAD was off for 15 min: a left
ventricular end-diastolic diameter of <60 mm; a left
ventricular end-systolic diameter of <50 mm and
a LVEF of >45%; a left ventricular end-diastolic
pressure (or pulmonary-capillary wedge pressure) of
<12 mm Hg; a resting cardiac index of >2.8 l/min/m2
of body surface area; and a maximal oxygen con-
sumption with exercise of >16 ml/kg/min and an
increase in minute ventilation relative to the carbon
dioxide production (ventilatory response) of <34 (26).
Patients in the present study were tested at an
average of 3.3 � 1.1 years (range 0.3 to 5.8 years)
following device explantation. All explanted LVAD
patients completed 2 stages of a pharmacological
regimen suggested by Birks et al. (26,27). In the first
stage
(intended
to
enhance
reverse
remodeling),
treatment with 4 drugs was initiated immediately
after the patient had been weaned from inotropic

 therapy
with
adequate
end-organ
recovery.
The
4 drugs and the maximum titrated doses were as
follows: lisinopril 40 mg daily; carvedilol 50 mg twice
daily;
spironolactone
25
mg
daily;
and
losartan
100 mg daily. The second stage of pharmacological
therapy was instituted after maximal regression in
the left ventricular end-diastolic diameter had been
achieved while the LVAD was in place. When a con-
stant left ventricular size had been maintained for
at least 2 weeks, according to echocardiographic
assessment,
clenbuterol
was
administered
at
an
initial dose of 40 mg twice daily, then at a dose of
40 mg 3 times daily, and finally at a dose of 700 mg
3 times daily. The dose was adjusted to maintain the
resting heart rate at a level below 100 beats/min.
Before
clenbuterol
was
started,
carvedilol
was
replaced by the selective b1-blocker bisoprolol (26). In
addition patients were advised to increase their
physical activity by walking >30 min per day.
All LVAD patients implanted were with a continuous
blood flow LVAD. Fifteen patients had a HeartMate II
(Thoratec, Pleasanton, California) and 3 patients had a
HeartWare (HeartWare Limited, Sydney, Australia)
device. All LVAD patients had dilated cardiomyopathy.
LVEF (measured on pump) ranged from 45% to 68%.
Time since device implantation averaged 219 � 87
days, with a range of 62 to 388 days. The indication for
insertion of the LVAD was the development of severe
heart failure that was not responsive to intensive
medical treatment, including inotropic support, with
evidence of impending or actual multiorgan failure
due to low cardiac output (26).
The
heart transplant candidates were patients
placed on the transplant waiting lists and their clin-
ical characteristics are presented in Table 1.
The ethics committee of the Royal Brompton and
Harefield Foundation Trust approved the study, and
all procedures were in accordance to the Declaration
of Helsinki. All patients who participated in the study
provided written informed consent.
RESTING AND PEAK EXERCISE MEASUREMENTS. Upon
arrival in the transplantation exercise laboratory,
each study participant’s weight and height were
measured.
Electrocardiographic
electrodes
were
attached according to the standard lead configuration
for exercise testing, and electrocardiographic cables
were connected. The patient then sat on a chair, and
after a 5-min resting period, arterial blood pressure
was assessed from the brachial artery by cuff sphyg-
momanometry. This was followed by measurement of
cardiac output in a seated position using the inert gas
rebreathing
method
(Innocor
A/S,
Innovision,
Odense, Denmark) as we have previously described
(11,12,29,30). Briefly, the Innocor device employs a
rebreathing system that uses an oxygen-enriched
mixture of an inert soluble gas (0.5% nitrous oxide)
and an inert insoluble gas (0.1% sulfur hexafluoride)
from a 4-l pre-filled anesthesia bag. Photoacoustic
analyzers measure gas concentrations over a 5-breath
interval. Nitrous oxide concentration decreases dur-
ing the rebreathing maneuver at a rate proportional to
pulmonary blood flow, allowing estimation of cardiac
output. Three to 4 respiratory cycles are needed to
obtain a value for nitrous oxide washout. After car-
diac output measurement at rest, each patient was
connected to the metabolic cart using a facemask.
Oxygen consumption, carbon dioxide production,
and minute ventilation were measured. After 3 min of
metabolic measurements at rest, heart transplant and
LVAD implanted patients performed a modified Bruce
protocol, and LVAD explanted patients and healthy
controls performed the Bruce protocol. Continuous
breath-by-breath sampling of respiratory gases and
heart rate measurements were undertaken. During
the last 30 s of each exercise stage, arterial blood
pressure was measured, and Borg scale recordings for
dyspnea and fatigue were performed. Patients were
instructed to give an approximately 1-min warning
before they felt they would end the exercise so
that a final cardiac output rebreathing measurement
was obtained at the peak of exercise. This is because
the Innocor device takes approximately 30 s to boot up
followed by 15 s to make the measurement. The patient

 continued to exercise through the measurement, and
cool down was started after it was complete. At the
same time during the rebreathing maneuver, peak
arterial blood pressure was measured.
CALCULATIONS AND STATISTICAL ANALYSES. The
cardiac power output was calculated from the product
of cardiac output and mean arterial pressure using the
following equation (12): CPO ¼ (QT � MAP) � K, where
CPO is cardiac power output measured in watts, QT is
cardiac output in liters per min, MAP is mean arterial
pressure in millimeters of mercury, and K is the con-
version factor (2.22 � 10�3). Mean arterial pressure was
calculated as: SBP þ 0.412 � (SBP � DBP), where SBP is
systolic blood pressure and DBP is diastolic blood
pressure (31). Systematic vascular resistance to blood
flow at peak exercise was estimated as the ratio be-
tween mean arterial pressure and cardiac output and,
according to convention, was multiplied by a factor of
80 to convert units to dynes per second per centimeter
to the fifth power.
For the purpose of comparing patients with con-
trols, the regression line of the controls can be assigned
the value of unity (100%), and the 2 SD on either side of
this unity line can therefore form the boundaries of the
reference range that represents the “normal” values
(32). The cardiac and functional data of patients can
therefore be represented as a percentage of the corre-
sponding average control value. Data points falling
within these boundaries are considered to be within
the “normal” range as previously suggested (32).
All statistical analysis was carried out using SPSS
version 21.0 (SPSS, Chicago, Illinois). Before statistical
analysis,
data
were
checked
for
univariate
and
multivariate outliers using standard Z-distribution
cutoffs and Mahalanobis distance tests, respectively.
Normality
of
distribution
was
assessed
using
a
Kolmogorov-Smirnov
test.
To
test
differences
in
measured variables between the patients’ groups, a
1-way analysis of variance was used. To identify the
groups that differed significantly from one another, a
post hoc Tukey test was performed. Nominal vari-
ables were evaluated using the chi-square test. Pear-
son coefficient of correlation was used to determine
the relationships between variables. Statistical sig-
nificance was indicated if p < 0.05. All data are pre-
sented as mean � SD unless otherwise indicated.

LVAD Bridge to Recovery
1927
 RESULTS
Patients’ demographic and clinical characteristics are
presented in Table 1. There were no significant dif-
ferences in demographic details between the patients
groups.
LVEF
was
significantly
lower
in
HTx
compared with LVAD patients and controls (p < 0.01).
Table 2 shows resting and peak exercise cardiac
and physical function variables in cardiac transplant
candidates, patients with implanted and explanted
LVAD, and healthy controls. It is apparent from
Table 2 that relative to healthy controls, the HTx and
LVAD
implanted
and
LVAD
explanted
patients
demonstrate cardiac and physical functional capac-
ities that were significantly diminished. Individual
data for patient groups are presented in Table 3.
To obtain a perspective of the spans involved, the
highest recorded cardiac and functional capacities
(i.e., cardiac power output and oxygen consumption
obtained at peak exercise were 7.7 W and 4.75 l/min,
respectively), and the corresponding mean values
were 5.4 � 0.9 W and 3.09 � 0.74 l/min. At the other
extreme, the lowest recorded peak cardiac power and
oxygen consumption values were in the HTx group
(i.e., 0.55 W and 0.45 l/min, respectively), and the
corresponding mean values were 1.4 � 0.2 W and
0.94 � 0.21 l/min, respectively. The mean values of
peak exercise cardiac power and oxygen consumption
of LVAD implanted patients were 2.4 � 0.4 W and 1.81
� 0.42 l/min, and of explanted patients, 3.4 � 0.7 W
and 2.51 � 0.42 l/min, respectively (all p < 0.05
compared with healthy controls) (Table 2).
To provide further insight into the cardiac and
functional benefits associated with LVAD bridge-to-
recovery protocol, the data confirmed that the ratio
between
peak
oxygen
consumption
and
cardiac
power output was the lowest in healthy controls
(6.79 � 1.68 ml O2/W), followed by LVAD explanted
(8.64 � 2.27 ml O2/W), then LVAD implanted patients
(8.65 � 3.41 ml O2/W), and then heart transplant
candidates
(9.16
�
2.88
ml
O2/W).
Additionally,
LVAD explanted patients who achieved a peak ex-
ercise cardiac power similar to that of healthy con-
trols demonstrated a 22% lower ratio between peak
oxygen
consumption
and
cardiac
power
output
than those LVAD explanted patients who had not
achieved the level of healthy controls (7.2 vs. 9.2 ml
O2/W; p ¼ 0.03).
When expressed relative to the reference values
of healthy subjects, as percentages of the average
control
values
of
cardiopulmonary
exercise
vari-
ables, it is possible to compare directly the relative
cardiac versus physical functional capabilities of the
patient groups. As shown in Figure 1, the diminution
in cardiac functional capacity (peak cardiac power
output) was most marked in the HTx group from
100% (the normalized average in healthy controls)
to 25.6 � 4.6% (p < 0.01), whereas the correspond-
ing diminution in physical functional capacity (peak
oxygen consumption) was to 33.7 � 8.5% (p < 0.01).
Of patients who recovered sufficiently to enable
LVAD explantation, 6 patients (37.5%) achieved peak
exercise cardiac power output that fell within the
normal
range
of
age-
and
sex-matched
healthy
controls
(Figure
2),
whereas
10
patients
(62.5%)
achieved peak exercise oxygen consumption levels
within the range of healthy controls (Figure 3). By
placing the relative values of cardiac versus physical
functional capacities of the patients groups side by
side as shown in Figure 1, it is apparent that in these
groups of patient cardiac functional capacity (peak
cardiac power) was more severely impaired than
physical impairments at peak exertion (peak oxygen
consumption). Figures 2 and 3 also show a well-
known normal phenomenon of age-related decline

 in cardiac and physical function performance. Each
of the HF cohorts also showed similar decline with
age, but also stepwise decreases with increasing
severity of HF.
An important aspect in LVAD explanted (recov-
ered) patients to be considered is the time since the
device was explanted (3.3 � 1.1 years, range 0.3 to 5.8
years). To address this point, we assessed the rela-
tionship between time since LVAD explantation and
the ratio between oxygen consumption and cardiac
power at peak exercise. There was a nonsignificant
relationship between time since LVAD explantation
and the ratio between oxygen consumption and car-
diac power at peak exercise (r ¼ �0.10; p ¼ 0.68)
(Central
Illustration),
suggesting
that
cardiac
and
functional recovery, once achieved with the LVAD
bridge-to-recovery program, is sustainable for several
years following LVAD explantation.
DISCUSSION
The major finding from the present study suggests
that a significant percentage of LVAD explanted pa-
tients can achieve cardiac and physical functional
capacities
that
are
within
the
normal
range
of
healthy controls. Our data further confirm previous
findings
suggesting
that
LVAD
therapy
improves
cardiac
and functional capacity
in
patients
with
confirmed
cardiac
end-stage
failure
and
provide
direct comparison with HTx. A limited number of
heart
transplantation
centers
have
demonstrated
cardiac recovery that is sufficient to permit LVAD
explantation (22,33). The findings of the present
study support the hypothesis that use of a LVAD can
lead to improvement in cardiac and functional ca-
pacities to allow for the LVAD to be efficiently
explanted (i.e., bridge to recovery).
On average, the cardiac functional gain by LVAD
compared with HTx patients was 1.1 W of peak cardiac
power output (D ¼ 56%), and the physical functional
gain was 8 ml/kg/min of peak oxygen consumption
(D ¼ 39%). If a perfect cardiac transplantation were
realizable, such as when an average HTx candidate
could be transformed into an average healthy control,
the ideal cardiac functional gain would be 4.0 W of
peak cardiac power (D ¼ 75%) and the ideal physical
functional gain would be w20 ml/kg/min of peak
oxygen consumption (D ¼ 70%). For a comparison
with real-life clinical cases, corrective operations on
appropriate valve disease patients can confer an
average cardiac functional gain of 0.79 W (D ¼ 23%)
and an average physical functional gain of 11%, as
shown in a longitudinal follow-up investigation (34).
Similarly,
the
functional
benefits
of
cardiac
resynchronization therapy confer an average cardiac
functional gain of 0.72 W (D ¼ 27%) and an average
physical functional gain of 16% (35). Data from the
present cross-sectional study of LVAD implanted pa-
tients suggest that this therapeutic modality in suit-
able
patients
can
confer
cardiac
and
physical
functional gains equivalent or superior to currently
established cardiac interventions.
LVAD explanted patients demonstrated signifi-
cantly better cardiac and functional capacities than
LVAD implanted patients and HTx. It is a remarkable
finding that 38% of LVAD explanted patients ach-
ieved the level of peak exercise cardiac function
equivalent to that of healthy controls. It is inter-
esting
that
69%
of
LVAD
explanted
patients
demonstrated peak oxygen consumption equivalent
to that of healthy controls. Taken together, these
findings suggest that a significant number of LVAD
explanted patients can achieve cardiac and func-
tional capacity similar to healthy controls confirming
benefits of LVAD therapy and directing future in-
vestigations towards strategies to enhance myocar-
dial recovery to allow for the device to be explanted.
Our
data
also
suggest
that
these
functional
improvements can be sustained.
The data from the present study can also throw
some light on a long-standing debate about whether
the cardiac dysfunction per se or the peripheral

 factors (including vasodilatory incapacity, pulmonary
or neurohumoral derangements, and skeletal muscle
contractile and metabolic abnormalities) are primar-
ily responsible for the exercise limitation seen in
heart failure patients (36). Hitherto, there has been no
methodology to determine whether the heart or the
periphery is the weaker link. The problem is further
complicated by the fact that any abnormality in either
factor (heart or periphery) can influence the perfor-
mance
measures
of
the
other
(37).
One way
of
resolving this uncertainty is by investigating whether
cardiac functional limitation is more (or less) severely
compromised than the physical functional impair-
ment in heart failure patients relative to a reference
cohort of healthy controls. Whichever one is more
severely impaired can be postulated as the likely
primary
cause,
and
moreover, a
reversal of
the
impairment would show a greater improvement in
the primary limiting factor than the secondary. This
investigation referenced the functional capacities of
healthy controls. In relative terms, in each heart
failure group in this study, the cardiac functional
reserve was on average more severely impaired than
the
aerobic
exercise
capacity
(Figure
1).
This
confirmed previously reported nonlinear relationship
between cardiac and functional capacity in LVAD and
heart failure patients (38).
Insight into what constitutes abnormal response
to stress observed in LVAD patients and heart trans-
plant candidates can be gained by unscrambling how
their peak exercise hemodynamic responses deviate
from the normal physiological responses observed
in healthy controls. In the absence of any valid
biomedical model of how each central hemodynamic
variable varies with peak oxygen uptake in normal
subjects, it is reasonable to assume that central he-
modynamic variables are linearly related to peak ox-
ygen uptake (39). A significant deviation from the
linear relation would constitute a departure from
physiology into the realm of pathology. Moreover, it
can be hypothesized that the greater the extent of
departure from physiological response would imply a
more severe pathology.
STUDY
LIMITATIONS. The
cross-sectional
study
design and limited number of patients in each heart
failure group may prevent generalization of the data.
Also, patients enrolled in the study were men. A lon-
gitudinal, multicenter study is therefore needed to
allow assessments of cardiac and functional capacities

will aim to identify strategies to enhance bridge-to-
recovery partway and define early markers of myocar-

CONCLUSIONS
It is remarkable that dilated cardiomyopathy pa-
tients
with
refractory
end-stage
heart
failure,
following the judicious use of combined LVAD and
medical therapies, were able to recover cardiac and
physical functional reserve capacities. The extent of
this recovery is that a significant number of them
can
achieve
the
levels
equivalent
to
those
of
healthy
controls.
More
aggressive
strategies
to
enhance
cardiac
remodeling
and
reconditioning
during LVAD support should be encouraged with
ultimate goal of LVAD explantation and return to a
pharmacological management. Assessment of cen-
tral hemodynamic measurements under cardiopul-
monary exercise stress testing can lead to early
identification
of
myocardial
recovery
in
LVAD
implanted patients.

PERSPECTIVES
COMPETENCY IN MEDICAL KNOWLEDGE: In
patients with advanced heart failure awaiting trans-
plantation, there was a significantly better cardiac
performance and functional capacity among those in
whom LVADs were explanted, a substantial propor-
tion of whom attained peak cardiac power output
and peak oxygen consumption in the range of
healthy individuals.
TRANSLATIONAL OUTLOOK: Prospective clinical
trials are needed to define optimal pharmacological
and physiological strategies to enhance myocardial
recovery and allow for use of LVADs as a bridge to
recovery of cardiac function.
