Passive immunization against misfolded toxic proteins is a promising approach to treat neurodegenerative disorders. For effective
immunotherapy against Alzheimer’s disease, recent clinical data indicate that monoclonal antibodies directed against the amyloid-b
peptide should be administered before the onset of symptoms associated with irreversible brain damage. It is therefore critical to
develop technologies for continuous antibody delivery applicable to disease prevention. Here, we addressed this question using a
bioactive cellular implant to deliver recombinant anti-amyloid-b antibodies in the subcutaneous tissue. An encapsulating device
permeable to macromolecules supports the long-term survival of myogenic cells over more than 10 months in immunocompetent
allogeneic recipients. The encapsulated cells are genetically engineered to secrete high levels of anti-amyloid-b antibodies. Peripheral
implantation leads to continuous antibody delivery to reach plasma levels that exceed 50 mg/ml. In a proof-of-concept study, we
show that the recombinant antibodies produced by this system penetrate the brain and bind amyloid plaques in two mouse models
of the Alzheimer’s pathology. When encapsulated cells are implanted before the onset of amyloid plaque deposition in TauPS2APP
mice, chronic exposure to anti-amyloid-b antibodies dramatically reduces amyloid-b40 and amyloid-b42 levels in the brain, decreases
amyloid plaque burden, and most notably, prevents phospho-tau pathology in the hippocampus. These results support the use of
encapsulated cell implants for passive immunotherapy against the misfolded proteins, which accumulate in Alzheimer’s disease and
other neurodegenerative disorders.

Introduction
Passive immunization using monoclonal antibodies has re-
cently emerged for the treatment of neurological diseases.
In particular, monoclonal antibodies can be administered to
target the misfolded proteins that progressively aggregate
and propagate in the CNS and contribute to the histo-
pathological
signature
of
neurodegenerative
diseases.
Alzheimer’s disease is the most prevalent proteinopathy,
characterized by the deposition of amyloid plaques and
neurofibrillary tangles. According to the ‘amyloid cascade
hypothesis’, which is supported by strong genetic evidence
(Goate and Hardy, 2012), the primary pathogenic event in
Alzheimer’s disease is the accumulation and aggregation of
amyloid-b into insoluble extracellular plaques in addition
to cerebral amyloid angiopathy (Hardy and Selkoe, 2002).
High levels of amyloid-b may cause a cascade of deleterious
events, including neurofibrillary tangle formation, neuronal
dysfunction and death. Anti-amyloid-b antibodies have
been developed to interfere with the amyloid-b cascade.
Promising data obtained in preclinical studies have vali-
dated immunotherapy against Alzheimer’s disease, prompt-
ing a series of clinical trials (Bard et al., 2000; Bacskai et
al., 2002; Oddo et al., 2004; Wilcock et al., 2004a;
Bohrmann et al., 2012). Phase III trials using monoclonal
antibodies directed against soluble amyloid-b (bapineu-
zumab and solanezumab) in patients with mild-to-moderate
Alzheimer’s disease showed some effects on biomarkers
that are indicative of target engagement. These trials, how-
ever, missed the primary endpoints, and it is therefore
believed that anti-amyloid-b immunotherapy should be ad-
ministered at the early presymptomatic stage (secondary
prevention) to better potentiate therapeutic effects (Doody
et al., 2014; Salloway et al., 2014). For the treatment of
Alzheimer’s disease, it is likely that long-term treatment
using a high dose of monoclonal antibody will be required.
However, bolus administration of anti-amyloid-b antibo-
dies may aggravate dose-dependent adverse effects such as
amyloid-related imaging abnormalities (ARIA) (Sperling et
al., 2012). In addition, the cost of recombinant antibody
production and medical burden associated with repeated
subcutaneous or intravenous bolus injections may represent
significant constraints, especially in the case of preventive
immunotherapy initiated years before the onset of clinical
symptoms in patients predisposed to develop Alzheimer’s
disease.
Therefore, alternative methods need to be developed for
the continuous, long-term administration of antibodies.
Here, we used an implant based on a high-capacity encap-
sulated cell technology (ECT) (Lathuiliere et al., 2014b).
The ECT device contains myogenic cells genetically engin-
eered for antibody production. Macromolecules can be
exchanged between the implanted cells and the host tissue
through a permeable polymer membrane. As the membrane
shields the implanted cells from immune rejection in allo-
geneic conditions, it is possible to use a single donor
cell source for multiple recipients. We demonstrate that
anti-amyloid immunotherapy using an ECT device im-
planted in the subcutaneous tissue can achieve therapeutic
effects inside the brain. Chronic exposure to anti-amyloid-b
monoclonal antibodies produced in vivo using the ECT
technology leads to a significant reduction of the amyloid
brain pathology in two mouse models of Alzheimer’s
disease.
Materials and methods
Macroencapsulation device
The flat sheet macroencapsulation device was specifically de-
signed for the subcutaneous implantation of cells and was en-
gineered as described elsewhere (Lathuiliere et al., 2014b). To
guarantee the quality and reproducibility of the device assem-
bly, a process based on ultrasonic welding was implemented.
The tight sealing of each device was controlled using an air-
leak test. The assembled device was 27-mm long, 12-mm wide
and 1.2-mm thick. The distance between the two permeable
membranes was between 100 and 300 mm and defined the
volume of the inner chamber. A loading port was integrated
into the device frame to allow the injection of cells through a
1 ml pipette tip connected to the device. The devices were gas
sterilized with ethylene oxide before further use.

 aggregates via a conformational epitope with binding proper-
ties that are similar to gantenerumab, as demonstrated by equi-
librium dissociation constant (KD) values of 0.14–0.67 nM,
which were determined for amyloid-b40 and amyloid-b42 by
surface plasmon resonance (Biacore). MAb-11 was derived
from the MorphoSys HuCAL-Fab1 phage display library
(Rauchenberger et al., 2003). For the present study, we synthe-
tized two cDNAs, encoding the light and heavy chains of a
chimeric version of mAb-11, containing the mouse constant
domains of murine IgG2a and the human variable domains
of mAb-11. We also used similar chimeric constructs encoding
the Fab and F(ab’)2 fragments derived from mAb-11 IgG2a
and lacking the murine Fc effector domain.
Cell culture and genetic engineering
Cell lines were purchased from the American Type Culture
Collection (ATCC) and maintained at 37 �C and 5% CO2 in
medium containing penicillin (100 U/ml) and streptomycin
(100 U/ml) (Invitrogen) according to ATCC guidelines. The
spontaneously immortalized C8-B4 mouse microglial cell line
(ATCC number CRL-2540) (Alliot et al., 1996) was cultured
in Dulbecco’s modified Eagle medium (DMEM) containing
10% foetal bovine serum (FBS). The C2C12 mouse myoblast
cell line (ATCC number CRL-1772), which is derived from the
leg skeletal muscles of an adult C3H (H2k) mouse (Yaffe and
Saxel, 1977), was grown in similar conditions.
To induce the secretion of the chimeric recombinant mAb-11
IgG2a, C2C12 myoblasts were genetically engineered using a
dual
lentiviral
vector
system,
as
described
previously
(Lathuiliere et al., 2014a). Briefly, cDNAs encoding either
the mAb-11 IgG2a light chain or heavy chain were subcloned
into
the
pRRLSIN.cPPT.PGK-GFP.WPRE
lentiviral
shuttle
plasmid (Addgene plasmid #12252). Lentivirus particles were
produced using a third-generation system using transient trans-
fection of HEK293T cells with pCMV-dR8.2�vpr, pMD2.G,
pRSV-Rev and the shuttle plasmid (Zufferey, 2002). Viral
titres (infectious particles) were determined for each vector
by infecting HeLa cells and measuring the number of inte-
grated vector genomes per cell by quantitative polymerase
chain reaction (as described in Charrier et al., 2005). A cell
population stably expressing mAb-11 was generated by lenti-
viral transduction of C2C12 myoblasts at a multiplicity of
infection (MOI) of 1500 for both the heavy and light chain
vectors. From this pool of cells, individual clones were isolated
using limiting dilution, expanded and screened according to
the measured rate of mAb-11 secretion. For the present
study, we used two clonal C2C12 myoblast cell lines, clones
#72 and #29, which secrete 13 pg/cell/day and 29 pg/cell/day of
the full mAb-11 IgG2a antibody, respectively. In addition, an-
other C2C12 clonal cell line was engineered to produce
11.4 pg/cell/day of a recombinant mAb-11 F(ab’)2 fragment
(clone #91L). For secretion of the full IgG2a antibody, clone
#29 was used in the 5XFAD mouse study and in the second
TauPS2APP mouse study. Clone #72 was used in the first
TauPS2APP mouse study. For the control ECT devices, cap-
sules were loaded with a population of C2C12 myoblasts
transduced with the pRRLSIN.cPPT.PGK-GFP.WPRE lenti-
viral
vector
(Addgene
plasmid
#12252),
as described
in
Lathuiliere et al. (2014a).
Microglial phagocytosis study
The measurement of antibody-mediated amyloid-b phagocyt-
osis was performed as proposed previously (Webster et al.,
2001). In this study, we used either purified preparations of
full mAb-11 IgG2a antibody, or a purified Fab antibody frag-
ment. A suspension of 530 mM fluorescent fibrillar amyloid-
b42 was prepared in 10 mM HEPES (pH 7.4) by stirring over-
night at room temperature. The resulting suspension contained
30
mM
fluorescein-conjugated
amyloid-b42
and
500
mM
unconjugated amyloid-b42 (Bachem). IgG-fibrillar amyloid-b42
immune complexes were obtained by preincubating fluorescent
fibrillar amyloid-b42 at a concentration of 50 mM in phos-
phate-buffered saline (PBS) with various concentrations of pur-
ified mAb-11 IgG2a or Fab antibody fragment for 30 min at
37 �C. The immune complexes were washed twice by centrifu-
gation for 5 min at 14 000g and resuspended in the initial
volume to obtain a fluorescent fibrillar amyloid-b42 solution
(total amyloid-b42 concentration: 530 mM). The day before
the experiment, 8 � 104 C8-B4 cells were plated in 24-well
plates. The medium was replaced with serum-free DMEM
before the addition of the peptides. The cells were incubated
for 30 min with fibrillar amyloid-b42 or IgG-fibrillar amyloid-
b42 added to the culture medium. Next, the cells were washed
twice with Hank’s Balanced Salt Solution (HBSS) and subse-
quently detached by trypsinization, which also eliminates sur-
face-bound fibrillar amyloid-b42. The cells were fixed for
10 min in 4% paraformaldehyde and finally resuspended in
PBS. The cell fluorescence was determined with a flow cyt-
ometer (Accuri C6; BD Biosciences), and the data were ana-
lysed using the FlowJo software (TreeStar Inc.). To determine
the effect of the anti-amyloid-b antibodies on amyloid-b
phagocytosis, the concentration of fluorescent fibrillar amyl-
oid-b42 was set at 1.5 mM, which is in the linear region of
the dose-response curve depicting fibrillar amyloid-b42 phago-
cytosis in C8-B4 cells (Fig. 2C). All experiments were per-
formed in duplicate.
Transgenic mice
Two different transgenic mouse models were utilized for the
present study. The two lines were backcrossed for more than
seven generations with C57BL/6N mice. The triple transgenic
TauPS2APP mouse line carries transgenes expressing the
Swedish (K670N/M671L) mutant of human APP, the N141I
mutant of PSEN2 and the P301L mutant of human tau
(Grueninger et al., 2010). The 5XFAD mouse line carries
two transgenes expressing human APP with three familial mu-
tations
[Swedish
(K670N/M671L),
Florida
(I716V)
and
London
(V717I)]
and
PS1
with
two
familial
mutations
(M146L and L286V) (Oakley et al., 2006). The experimental
groups were rigorously age-matched. All experiments were
performed in accordance with Swiss legislation and with the
European Community Council directive (86/609/EEC) for the
care and use of laboratory animals. Animals were housed in a
controlled temperature room that was maintained in a 12:12 h
light:dark cycle and had access to water and food ad libitum.
In vivo studies
The devices were loaded with 106 mAb-11-expressing C2C12
cells mixed with a hydrogel scaffold composed of 1.5%

 polyethylene glycol (PEG) (Ehrbar et al., 2007). Capsules were
randomly assigned to individual mice in each group. The de-
tailed procedure for loading and implantation has been previ-
ously described (Lathuiliere et al., 2014b). Blood was sampled
from the facial vein starting at 3 weeks after surgery and then
again once every other week until the end of the experiment.
The blood was collected in EDTA-coated tubes and centri-
fuged for 5 min at 1500g to separate the plasma. The concen-
tration
of
mAb-11
was
determined
by
enzyme-linked
immunosorbent assay (ELISA) on the same day as collection,
and the remaining plasma samples were kept frozen at �80 �C.
At the end of the experiment, the animals were sacrificed with
an overdose of pentobarbital. Terminal intracardiac puncture
was performed to collect the blood samples. The animals were
perfused with heparinized PBS. After opening the skull, the
brains were carefully dissected and fresh frozen at �80 �C
until further use. Implants were dissected from the subcutane-
ous tissue and incubated overnight in 6-well plates containing
DMEM supplemented with 10% FBS. The following day, the
mAb-11 secretion level was quantified by incubating the im-
plant in 2.5 ml of fresh culture medium for 1 h. The concen-
trations of mAb-11 were determined in samples of culture
medium by ELISA.
MAb-11 quantification
The mAb-11 concentration was quantified in mouse plasma
and culture medium using an ELISA assay, as previously
described (Lathuiliere et al., 2014a). As standards, we used
either purified mAb11 IgG2a or a purified recombinant
mAb-11 Fab fragment. The plasma samples were diluted
at least 1:100 in Low Cross Buffer (Candor) and loaded
in duplicate. The colorimetric reaction was quantified at a
wavelength
of
405 nm
on
a
Versamax
plate
reader
(Molecular Devices). A standard curve was generated by a
non-linear four-parameter fit, and the sample concentration
was
calculated
using
SoftMax
Pro
software
(Molecular
Devices).
Anti-drug antibody detection assay
To detect antibodies against mAb-11 IgG2a, a direct immuno-
assay was implemented. Briefly, 96-well microtitre plates were
coated with 20 mg/ml of purified mAb-11 and blocked with
2% bovine serum albumin (BSA) in PBS. After incubation with
the plasma samples, the presence of bound IgM was measured
by
incubation
with
a
conjugated
goat
anti-mouse
IgM
(Jackson Immunoresearch), followed by a colorimetric reaction
with ABTS solution (Roche Applied Science). In a pre-study
validation experiment performed with 30 naive plasma sam-
ples, the minimal dilution was set to 1:100 and the cut point
was determined by calculating the mean plus 1.645 times the
standard deviation, corresponding to 5% false positive detec-
tion (Geng et al., 2005). For screening, a dynamic cut point
was used (Shankar et al., 2008), and the positive samples were
serially diluted to determine the anti-drug antibody titre.
Immunohistochemistry
The 10 mm sagittal cryosections were prepared from each
mouse brain on Superfrost plus slides (Thermo Scientific).
The sections were fixed in �20 �C acetone for 3 min and
washed in PBS plus 0.01% Tween-20. For the detection of
the mAb-11 IgG2a (plaque immunodecoration), the blocking
of non-specific binding sites was performed by incubating the
slides in Ultra V blocking solution (LabVision) for 5 min, fol-
lowed by a wash in PBS plus 0.01% Tween-20 and a subse-
quent incubation in Power Block solution (BioGenex) with
10% normal sheep serum for 20 min. Cy3-conjugated goat-
anti-mouse
IgG2a
isotype-specific
antibody
(Jackson
Immunoresearch) was diluted to 16 mg/ml in PBS plus 1%
BSA and 0.01% Tween-20 and incubated for 1 h at room
temperature. For the detection of the F(ab’)2 fragment of
mAb-11, blocking of endogenous peroxidase was performed
using Phenylhydrazine 0.1% in PBS during 1 h at 37 �C.
After washing with PBS, brain sections were blocked in 2%
NDS, 1% BSA in 0.1% TritonTM X-100 PBS during 2 h at
room temperature. Biotin-SP-conjugated goat anti-mouse IgGs
recognizing the F(ab’)2 fragment (Jackson Immunoresearch)
were diluted 1:500 in blocking solution and incubated on
slices
overnight
at
4 �C.
For
labelling,
Alexa
Fluor�
568-labelled Tyramide Signal Amplification kit (TSATM, Life
technologies) was used according to the manufacturer’s in-
structions. For the detection of amyloid-b plaques, sections
were blocked with 2% BSA and 5% normal goat serum
in PBS for 1 h at room temperature. Biotinylated 6E10 anti-
amyloid-b monoclonal antibody (Covance) was diluted to 1
mg/ml in blocking buffer and incubated overnight at 4 �C.
After washing in PBS plus 0.001% Tween-20, an Alexa
Fluor� 555 labelled TSA kit was used according to the manu-
facturer’s instructions (Invitrogen). To demonstrate the binding
of mAb-11 to amyloid-b plaques, purified mAb-11 at a con-
centration of 1 mg/ml was incubated overnight at 4 �C on brain
sections from the TauPS2APP mice that had not been exposed
to any antibody treatment. After three washing steps, the
bound mAb-11 antibody was detected with Cy3-conjugated
goat
anti-mouse
IgG2a
secondary
antibody
(Jackson
Immunoresearch). Immunodetection of phosphorylated tau
with AT8 was performed using the Alexa Fluor� 568-labeled
TSA Kit (Life technologies). Biotin-labelled mouse anti-human
PHF-Tau monoclonal antibody (AT8, Thermo Scientific) was
used at a 1:500 dilution. Immunostaining for phospho-S422
tau was performed as described in (Grueninger et al., 2010).
For Iba1 and MC1 immunostainings, mounted sections were
fixed for 10 min in 4% paraformaldehyde, washed with PBS
and incubated for 1 h at 37 �C in 0.1% phenylhydrazine, fol-
lowed by blocking in 10% normal goat serum, 1% BSA and
0.3% PBS TritonTM X-100 for 2 h at room temperature. The
mouse monoclonal MC1 antibody (provided by P. Davies,
1:500 dilution) and the rabbit anti-Iba1 antibody (Wako,
019-19741, 1:2000 dilution) were incubated with brain sec-
tions overnight at 4 �C and revealed with the DAB chromogen.
Following Iba1 immunostaining, Congo Red histochemical
staining was performed as described in Wilcock et al. (2006b).
Histological staining
The devices were fixed overnight at 4 �C in 4% paraformalde-
hyde, dehydrated and processed for embedding in paraffin.
Three-micrometre thick sections were prepared on a micro-
tome and stained according to Masson’s trichrome protocol.
To detect the possible presence of microhaemorrhages in the
brain tissue, the Perl’s Prussian blue protocol was used to stain
the ferric ions present in haemosiderin. An observer blind to

 the experimental treatment manually scored the presence of
microhaemorrhages
on
six
25-mm
thick
sagittal
sections
chosen at regular intervals across one brain hemisphere of
each animal.
Microscopy and image processing
To quantify the amyloid-b plaque load in sections stained with
the 6E10 antibody, the slides were scanned using the Virtual
Slide System VS120-L100 slide scanner (Olympus) with a
10� objective. For the first two in vivo studies, for each
mouse, we analysed the presence of amyloid plaques in four
sagittal sections, in the medial part of the cortex of one brain
hemisphere, with an interval of 100 mm between each section.
After manual segmentation of the brain regions of interest, the
images were processed by automated thresholding according to
Li’s minimum cross entropy thresholding method, which is
based on an iterative version of the algorithm in ImageJ soft-
ware. For the last study, for each mouse, we analysed the
presence of amyloid plaques in 18 sagittal sections, in the
medial part of the cortex of one brain hemisphere, with an
inter-slice interval of 60 mm. After manual segmentation of the
brain regions of interest, the images were processed by auto-
mated thresholding according to Renyi entropy thresholding
method.
Representative images of device histology and immunohisto-
logical staining of the brain tissue were acquired using a DM
5500 microscope (Leica). For immunodecoration in 5XFAD
mouse tissue, high-resolution confocal images were acquired
using a 63� NA 1.4 oil immersion objective on a LSM700
Zeiss microscope and deconvoluted with Huygens software
(Scientific
Volume
Imaging).
For
Immunodecoration
on
TauPS2APP mice tissue, high-resolution confocal images were
acquired using 40� oil immersion objective on a LSM700
Zeiss microscope.
Tau quantification was performed by counting neurons posi-
tive for phosphorylated tau (AT8 staining) located in the hip-
pocampal
CA1
region
(first
600
mm,
starting
from
the
subiculum), as described in Collin et al. (2014), using an
Olympus DP50 microscope equipped with a 10� objective.
Six sections located in the medial part of the cortex, with an
interslice interval of 60 mm, were counted in each animal.
Microglia quantification was performed by counting Iba1-
positive cells within an area of 250 � 250 mm2 centred on
an amyloid plaque stained with Congo Red. If possible,
isolated amyloid plaques smaller than 50 mm � 50 mm
were preferably considered for the quantification. For con-
trol and F(ab’)2 treated groups, microglia were counted
around two plaques per sections in six sections with an
interslice interval of 60 mm. For the IgG2a treated group,
considering the very low number of remaining plaques,
microglia were counted around 100 plaques distributed as
equally as possible among sections and animals. All the
quantifications were performed by an observer blind to the
experimental groups.
Amyloid-b peptide quantification
The concentration of the amyloid-b40 and amyloid-b42 pep-
tides was measured using specific commercial ELISA assays
(Invitrogen) according to the manufacturer’s protocol. Briefly,
frozen brain tissue from the lateral part of the cortex was
homogenized in 5 M guanidine, 50 mM Tris, pH 8 (at a 1:8
ratio between the wet tissue mass and the buffer mass).
Samples were diluted in PBS containing 5% BSA, 0.03%
Tween-20 and a complete protease inhibitor cocktail (Roche)
before being subjected to the ELISA assay.
Gratings-based X-ray phase contrast
tomographic microscopy and
quantification of amyloid-b plaques
Whole volume amyloid-b plaque quantifications were per-
formed using grating-based X-ray phase contrast tomographic
microscopy as described in Pinzer et al. (2012). In brief, the
data were collected with a grating interferometer installed at
the TOMCAT beamline of the Swiss Light Source with a
photon energy of 25 keV (McDonald et al., 2009). The
phase grating (pitch of 3.98 mm) and the absorption grating
(pitch of 2.00 mm) were placed and aligned at the third Talbot
distance (121 mm). A total of 1440 projections were collected
over a sample rotation of 180�/7 phase steps of the phase
grating. The beam size was 14.6 � 4.2 mm2 that permitted to
scan three half brains at the same time with three vertical
scans. The photons were converted in light using a LuAG:Ce
scintillator 350-mm thick and subsequently read by a CMOS
detector (PCO.Edge) with a pixel size of 6.5 mm. Differential
phase contrast slices were reconstructed and filtered accord-
ingly with Pinzer et al. (2012). For each sample, a manual
segmentation of the brain cortex was done defining our
region of interest. The amyloid-b plaques were counted over
the region of interest using IDL software (http://www.exelisvis.
com) excluding from the result amyloid-b plaques smaller than
10 voxels and larger than 500 voxels (which translate in an
equivalent spherical plaque of 17 mm and 64 mm, respectively,
in diameter) to avoid the counting of noise signal or artefacts
as amyloid-b plaques. The segmentation threshold was care-
fully decided based on visual investigation on representative
samples and kept constant over all the samples. To account
for the subjective threshold decision (lower values increase
the number of plaques), the counting procedure was run
using five different thresholds equally distributed over the ini-
tially selected one plus/minus the standard deviation of the
background noise [as performed in a similar situation in
Astolfo et al. (2013)]. The mean (shown in Fig. 7D) and de-
viation standard calculated over these five total numbers of
amyloid-b plaques was used to estimate the plaque density.
The number of plaques was determined in individual cubic vol-
umes of 50 � 50 � 50 pixels (50 pixels = 325 mm) and ex-
pressed as a density of amyloid-b plaques, colour-coded in
Fig. 7B and C.
Statistical analysis
Results were analysed through either one-way or two-way
ANOVA, using the Newman-Keuls test for post hoc multiple
comparisons. For comparisons between two groups, two-tailed
heteroscedastic Student’s t-tests were applied. Correlations
were analysed using the Pearson’s test. Analyses were per-

Results
Cell encapsulation supports the
long-term survival of myoblasts
secreting anti-amyloid-b monoclonal
antibodies
As an alternative mode for the chronic delivery of thera-
peutic monoclonal antibodies, we developed a flat sheet
ECT device for the subcutaneous implantation of genetic-
ally engineered myogenic cells (Fig. 1A) (Lathuiliere et al.,
2014b). For passive immunization against the amyloid
pathology, we genetically modified C2C12 mouse myo-
blasts using a dual lentiviral vector system to produce a
murinized chimeric recombinant IgG2a antibody (mAb-
11) directed against both amyloid plaques and amyloid-b
oligomers (Lathuiliere et al., 2014a). We derived clonal
C2C12 cell lines secreting either the full mAb-11 IgG2a
antibody, or a recombinant mAb-11 F(ab’)2 fragment,
which retains the ability to bind amyloid-b but lacks the
antibody Fc portion.
The high-capacity flat sheet ECT device developed for
subcutaneous implantation was based on a polypropylene
frame (1 cm � 2.5 cm) supporting two polypropylene mem-
branes with 0.45 mm pores (Fig. 1B). The device was mech-
anically reinforced with a polyester mesh apposed on the
external face of the porous membrane, which allowed for
the development of a dense neovascularization network fol-
lowing implantation in the subcutaneous tissue (Fig. 1C).
Prior to device implantation, 106 C2C12 myoblasts were
mixed with a degradable PEG hydrogel and injected inside
the device. After a 9-month implantation in C57BL/6 mice,
the C2C12 cells had expanded in the capsule inner space to
form a dense cell mass interspersed with a collagen-rich
extracellular matrix (Fig. 1D and E). When loaded with
mAb-11-secreting
myoblasts,
this
cellular
implant
was
found to continuously produce recombinant anti-amyloid-
b antibodies both in vitro and in vivo.
The plaque-specific mAb-11
antibody enhances fibrillar amyloid-b
phagocytosis by microglial cells
We determined in vitro if the chimeric recombinant IgG2a
mAb-11 was able to bind aggregated amyloid-b and en-
hance phagocytosis by mouse microglial cells, a mechanism
that has been proposed to mediate the clearance of amyloid
plaques
(Bard
et
al.,
2000;
Bohrmann
et
al.,
2012;
Demattos et al., 2012). Brain sections from 16-month-old
TauPS2APP mice incubated with mAb-11 showed specific
binding to brain amyloid deposits (Fig. 2A), consistent with
the high affinity of mAb-11 for aggregated amyloid-b.
Next, we incubated C8-B4 mouse microglial cells with
fluorescent amyloid-b42 fibrils, and assessed their ability
to internalize fibrillar amyloid-b42 by flow cytometry. The
cell fluorescence increased as a function of the fibrillar
amyloid-b42 concentration (Fig. 2B), in a linear relationship
at fibrillar amyloid-b42 concentrations 55 mM (Fig. 2C).
Internalization of fibrillar amyloid-b42 at a concentration
of 1.5 mM was significantly increased following preincuba-
tion with mAb-11 IgG2a (Fig. 2D). As expected, the
increased uptake of fibrillar amyloid-b by microglial cells
was mediated by the Fc region, as no effect was found by
preincubating fibrillar amyloid-b42 with a mAb-11-derived
Fab fragment lacking the Fc effector domain (P = 0.00017
compared to full IgG2a).
Passive immunization by ECT
delivery of mAb-11 decreases
amyloid brain pathology in 5XFAD
mice
We assessed the efficacy of ECT-mediated immunotherapy
in a mouse model of Alzheimer’s disease with a rapidly
evolving amyloid pathology. 5XFAD mice overexpress
mutated forms of the human amyloid precursor protein
(APP) and human presenillin 1 (PS1, encoded by PSEN1).
The induced amyloid-b42 production leads to intraneuronal
amyloid-b accumulation at 1.5 months and amyloid plaque
deposition after only 2 months (Oakley et al., 2006).
To model the secondary prevention of Alzheimer’s disease,
age-matched cohorts of 5XFAD mice were implanted be-
tween 5 and 12 weeks of age, after the onset of plaque
deposition. Flat sheet devices were loaded with C2C12
myoblasts secreting the full mAb-11 IgG2a (clone #29).
Just 7 weeks after implantation, 15.2 � 3.8 mg/ml of
mAb-11 could be detected in the plasma, further increasing
to 59.1 � 6.7 mg/ml at the experimental end-point, 19
weeks post-implantation (Fig. 3A). Explanted devices se-
creted, on average, 105.5 � 11.2 mg/day of mAb11 IgG2a
(Fig. 3A). Based on the pharmacokinetic parameters mea-
sured
by
injecting
recombinant
mAb-11
in
mice
(Supplementary
material),
the
total
antibody
exposure
(3.96 � 0.43 mg/ml�day) was estimated to be equivalent
to weekly intravenous injections of recombinant mAb-11
IgG2a
at
a
dose
of
16.7 � 1.9 mg/kg
for
19
weeks
(Supplementary material).
We sought to determine whether the antibodies produced
by ECT could be detected inside the brain. Indeed, the
blood–brain barrier limits IgG penetration into the brain,
with a typical plasma/brain antibody concentration ratio
between 100 and 1000 (Wang et al., 2008; Tabrizi et al.,
2010). In all mice implanted with a mAb-11 releasing ECT
device, brain sections showed antibody immunodecoration
localizing to amyloid-b plaques, as indicated by mouse
IgG2a
immunoreactivity
(Fig.
3B).

was observed
on fibrillar
bundles
around plaques and on the dense cores of amyloid-b aggre-
gates (Fig. 3C).
To assess the amyloid pathology in 5XFAD mice, we
performed anti-amyloid-b immunohistochemistry on brain
sections. Dense and widespread amyloidosis, mainly affect-
ing the cortex, hippocampus and thalamus, was found in 5-
to 6-month-old animals implanted with devices containing
GFP-expressing
C2C12
myoblasts
(Fig.
4A
and
B).
Amyloid pathology was reduced in the 5XFAD mice trea-
ted with the mAb-11 secreting devices (Fig. 4C and D).
Quantitative morphometry showed a significant reduction
of the percentage of area covered with amyloid-b plaques
in
the
cortex
(�31.0%,
P = 0.0069),
hippocampus
(�18.1%, P = 0.018) and thalamus (�31.7%, P = 0.013)
(Fig. 4E). Plaque density was decreased in the same brain

pus: �20.1%,

 1). In cortical homogenates, the mAb-11 treatment signifi-
cantly reduced the levels of total amyloid-b42 (P = 0.0027)
and amyloid-b40 (P = 0.0025) (Fig. 4H). We found a sig-
nificant negative correlation between the total amyloid-b42
levels and the exposure to mAb-11 in the plasma, indicat-
ing
that
treatment
efficacy
primarily
depends
on
the
amount of antibody delivered (Fig. 4I). Prussian blue stain-
ing did not reveal any sign of microhaemorrhages in the
mAb-11-treated mice (data not shown). Because mAb-11
IgG2a
comprised
complementarity-determining
regions
(CDR)
derived
from
the
human
antibody,
we
tested
whether the treated animals developed an anti-drug anti-
body response by measuring the presence of antibodies
recognizing mAb-11 in the mouse plasma. Only 1 of 16
animals developed a significant anti-drug antibody response
with the detectable presence of anti-mAb-11 IgM (data not
shown).
Overall,
our
results
demonstrate
that
ECT-
mediated peripheral immunotherapy can partially oppose
amyloid
pathology
in
the
rapidly
developing
5XFAD
mouse model.
Preventive mAb-11 immunization by
ECT reduces amyloid pathology in
the brain of TauPS2APP mice
Immunization against amyloid-b has been shown to be
most effective when initiated before the onset of plaque
deposition in mouse models of Alzheimer’s disease (Das
et al., 2001; Levites et al., 2006). To further assess the
effect of passive immunization, we next used TauPS2APP
mice, a slowly progressing model that develops both amyl-
oid and tau pathologies, and therefore more closely mimics
sporadic
Alzheimer’s
disease.
The
first
experiment
is
described
in
the
Supplementary
material
and
Supplementary Fig. 2. Briefly, ECT devices secreting mAb-
11 IgG2a were implanted in 7-month-old TauPS2APP mice,
leading
to
chronic
antibody
exposure
for
39
weeks.
Similarly to the previous experiment in 5XFAD mice,
ECT-mediated passive immunization led to a significant de-
crease in amyloid deposition. However, 7 of 15 mAb-11-
treated animals had detectable levels of anti-mAb-11 IgM,
indicating that this mouse model may be more prone to
develop an anti-drug antibody response potentially neutra-
lizing part of the treatment effects.
In a second experiment, ECT devices were subcutane-
ously implanted in 2-month-old TauPS2APP mice to deliver
mAb-11 antibodies 6 months before the onset of amyloid
deposition outside the hippocampus. The mice were transi-
ently injected with anti-CD4 antibodies to block the anti-
drug antibody response against mAb-11. Three groups of
mice received either control GFP-expressing myoblasts,
myoblasts secreting the mAb-11 IgG2a antibody (clone
#29), or myoblasts producing a mAb-11-derived F(ab’)2
fragment. Already 3 weeks after implantation of the anti-
body-releasing device, both the full mAb-11 IgG2a (16.2
mg/ml, Fig. 5A) and the mAb-11 F(ab’)2 fragment (0.5 mg/
ml, Fig. 5B) were detectable in the plasma of the respective
groups of mice. Plasma levels then stabilized at �50 mg/ml
(mAb-11 IgG2a) and 2 mg/ml [mAb-11 F(ab’)2] until the
experimental
end-point,
41
weeks
after
implantation.
Explanted devices showed secretion rates reaching on aver-
age 33.7 � 9.7 mg/day for the mAb-11 IgG2a (�150 kDa)
and 17.7 � 2.8 mg/day for the mAb-11 F(ab’)2 fragment
(�110 kDa). Higher secretion rate, higher stability and
longer half-life of the full IgG, compared to the F(ab’)2
fragment, all contribute to the 25-fold difference seen in
the
plasma
concentration.
Total
plasma
exposure
to
mAb-11 IgG2a during the 41-week implantation period
(14.8 mg/ml�day) was estimated to be equivalent to a
regimen of weekly intravenous injections at a dose of
29.5 mg/kg.

 assessed if the mAb-11 treatment had any effect on the
recruitment of Iba1-positive microglial cells near amyloid
deposits (Congo red staining) (Supplementary Fig. 3 and
Fig. 5D). In the cortex of control TauPS2APP mice, there
were on average 8.7 � 0.3 Iba1-positive microglial cells
neighbouring Congo red-stained individual plaques. The
number of microglial cells around plaques was significantly
decreased to 7.3 � 0.3 in the F(ab’)2-treated mice, whereas
it was increased to 9.7 � 0.4 in the IgG2a-treated mice.
Therefore, the recruitment of microglial cells depends on
the presence of the Fc region of the mAb-11 antibody
bound to the amyloid plaques.
When initiated before plaque deposition occurred in
TauPS2APP mice, the chronic subcutaneous delivery of
mAb-11 IgG2a led to a dramatic reduction in amyloid
burden detected by anti-amyloid-b immunohistochemistry,
compared with the mice implanted with control devices
(Fig. 6A). Plaque load was clearly reduced throughout the
cortex (�79.9%, P = 0.004) and hippocampus (�78.5%,
P = 0.017) (Fig. 6B). Similarly, the number of plaques
was dramatically decreased in both regions (�94.5%
and �92.7%, respectively; Fig. 6C). There was minimal de-
position of amyloid plaques in the thalamus of 12-month-
old TauPS2APP mice. In contrast, the amyloid burden was
reduced by only 15–20% with F(ab’)2-secreting devices, an
effect that was not significant (P 4 0.2). Compared to the
control group, amyloid-b levels were also dramatically
reduced in the cortex of IgG2a-treated mice, for both

P = 0.0002)
and
amyloid-b40
(�82.5%, P = 0.024), whereas the effect of the F(ab’)2 frag-
ment remained minimal (Fig. 6D). Of note, the level of
amyloid-b42 in the cortex of 12-month-old TauPS2APP
mice was more than 5-fold lower compared to 7-month-
old 5XFAD mice (compare Figs 6D and 4H). Altogether,
these results indicate that when delivered by ECT, full
IgG2a antibodies are more effective than F(ab’)2 fragments
for the clearing of amyloid pathology, most likely because
ECT leads to higher levels of circulating mAb-11 IgG2a in
the plasma (Fig. 5A and B).
Strong reduction of plaque density
throughout the whole cortex of
ECT
-mAb-11 treated mice
To further quantify the number of amyloid plaques in
ECT-treated mice, the entire contralateral hemicortex of
the treated mice was analysed by gratings-based X-
ray phase contrast tomographic microscopy (Weitkamp
et
al.,
2005;
Pinzer
et
al.,
2012).
This
technique
allows full brain visualization and does not rely on
immunodetection methods, which may be subject to
interference with the therapeutic antibody bound to
amyloid-b. X-ray phase contrast revealed the presence
of
discrete
hyperintense
dots
throughout
the
entire
cortex
of
12-month-old
TauPS2APP
mice
implanted
with control devices. These dots were previously shown
to correspond to amyloid deposits (Pinzer et al., 2012).
The density of plaques in the cortex (plaques/mm3) was
determined following threshold segmentation (Fig. 7A
and B and Supplementary Videos 1–3). Coronal max-
imum-intensity
maps
show
that
plaque
density
was
clearly reduced in the entire hemicortex of the mAb-11

and distribution of amyloid plaques were similar in

from the phase contrast CT datasets was used to deter-
mine the total number of plaques in the hemicortex
of the mice in each group (Fig. 7D). The mAb-11

tectable plaques (�83%, P = 0.00013), whereas the effect

 Reduced amyloid-b deposition
correlates with decreased tau
pathology in the CA1 hippocampus
Next, we analysed the presence of hyperphosphorylated
forms of human tau in the CA1 region of the hippocampus
of TauPS2APP mice, which overexpress P301L-mutated
human tau (Fig. 8A). We assessed the number of neurons
located in the CA1 pyramidal layer with an accumulation
of AT8-positive phospho-tau (S202/T205) in the somato-
dendritic compartment (Fig. 8B). In mAb-11 IgG2a-treated
mice, the number of AT8-positive neurons was significantly
decreased with respect to both control (P = 0.005) and
F(ab’)2-treated mice (P = 0.035). However, there was no
significant difference between the control and F(ab’)2-
treated
groups (P = 0.2).
Furthermore,
the number
of
AT8-positive neurons in the CA1 was strongly correlated
with amyloid burden in the cortex across all three groups
(Fig. 8C), confirming that pathological hyperphosphoryla-
tion of tau is linked to amyloid-b deposition in this mouse
model (Grueninger et al., 2010).
To confirm the effect of immunotherapy on another tau
phosphorylation site, phospho-S422 tau was stained on ad-
jacent sections of the hippocampus. Again, the number of
CA1 neurons with a somatodendritic accumulation of
phospho-S422 tau was significantly reduced in the mAb-
11
IgG2a-treated
mice
compared
to
control
animals
(P = 0.006) (Fig. 8D and E). Next, to assess the effect on
tau misfolding, we performed a staining with the conform-
ation-dependent MC1 antibody. The number of MC1-posi-
tive
neuronal
cell
bodies
in
CA1
hippocampus
was
significantly
decreased
in
mAb-11
IgG2a-treated
mice
(P = 0.0098).
Altogether, these results indicate that preventive passive
immunization using ECT delivery of recombinant mAb-11
IgG2a antibodies in the periphery is an effective approach
to chronically deliver therapeutic antibodies, reduce amyl-
oid deposition throughout the brain and mitigate down-
stream effects on the tau pathology.
Discussion
The implantation of genetically engineered cells within a
retrievable subcutaneous device leads to the continuous
production of monoclonal antibodies in vivo. This technol-
ogy achieves steady therapeutic monoclonal antibody levels
in the plasma, offering an effective alternative to bolus in-
jections for passive immunization against chronic diseases.
Peripheral delivery of anti-amyloid-b monoclonal antibody
by ECT leads to a significant reduction of amyloid burden
in two mouse models of Alzheimer’s disease. The effect of
the ECT treatment is more pronounced when passive im-
munization is preventively administered in TauPS2APP
mice, most notably decreasing the phospho-tau pathology.
With the recent development of biomarkers to monitor
Alzheimer’s pathology, it is recognized that a steady in-
crease in cerebral amyloid over the course of decades pre-
cedes the appearance of the first cognitive symptoms
(reviewed in Sperling et al., 2011). The current consensus
therefore suggests applying anti-amyloid-b immunotherapy
during this long asymptomatic phase to avoid the down-
stream consequences of amyloid deposition and to leverage
neuroprotective effects. Several preventive clinical trials
have been recently initiated for Alzheimer’s disease. The
Alzheimer’s
Prevention
Initiative
(API)
and
the
Dominantly Inherited Alzheimer Network (DIAN) will
test antibody candidates in presymptomatic dominant mu-
tation carriers, while the Anti-Amyloid treatment in the
Asymptomatic Alzheimer’s disease (A4) trial enrols asymp-
tomatic subjects after risk stratification. If individuals with
a high risk of developing Alzheimer’s disease can be iden-
tified using current biomarker candidates, these patients are
the most likely to benefit from chronic long-term anti-amyl-
oid-b immunotherapy. However, such a treatment may
pose a challenge to healthcare systems, as the production
capacity of the antibody and its related cost would become
a challenging issue (Skoldunger et al., 2012). Therefore, the
development of alternative technologies to chronically ad-
minister anti-amyloid-b antibody is an important aspect for
therapeutic interventions at preclinical disease stages.
Here, we show that the ECT technology for the periph-
eral delivery of anti-amyloid-b monoclonal antibodies can
significantly reduce cerebral amyloid pathology in two
mouse models of Alzheimer’s disease. The subcutaneous
tissue is a site of implantation easily accessible and there-
fore well adapted to preventive treatment. It is, however,
challenging to reach therapeutic efficacy, as only a small
fraction of the produced anti-amyloid-b monoclonal anti-
bodies are expected to cross the blood–brain barrier, al-
though they can next persist in the brain for several
months (Wang et al., 2011; Bohrmann et al., 2012). Our
results are consistent with previous reports, which have
shown that the systemic administration of anti-amyloid-b
antibodies can decrease brain amyloid burden in preclinical
Alzheimer’s disease models (Bard et al., 2000, 2003;
DeMattos et al., 2001; Wilcock et al., 2004a, b; Buttini
et al., 2005; Adolfsson et al., 2012).
Remarkably, striking differences exist among therapeutic
anti-amyloid-b antibodies in their ability to clear already
existing plaques. Soluble amyloid-b species can saturate
the small fraction of pan-amyloid-b antibodies entering
the CNS and inhibit further target engagement (Demattos
et al., 2012). Therefore, antibodies recognizing soluble
amyloid-b may fail to bind and clear insoluble amyloid
deposits (Das et al., 2001; Racke et al., 2005; Levites et
al., 2006; Bohrmann et al., 2012). Furthermore, antibody-
amyloid-b complexes are drained towards blood vessels,
promoting cerebral amyloid angiopathy (CAA) and subse-
quent microhaemorrhages. The mAb-11 antibody used in
the present study is similar to gantenerumab, which is
highly specific for amyloid plaques and reduces amyloid

 burden in patients with Alzheimer’s disease (Bohrmann et
al., 2012; Demattos et al., 2012; Ostrowitzki et al., 2012).
We find that the murine IgG2a mAb-11 antibody efficiently
enhances the phagocytosis of amyloid-b fibrils by microglial
cells. In addition, ECT administration of the mAb-11
F(ab’)2 fragment lacking the Fc region fails to recruit micro-
glial cells, and leads only to a trend towards clearance of
the amyloid plaques. Therefore, our results suggest a piv-
otal role for microglial cells in the clearance of amyloid
plaques following mAb-11 delivery by ECT. Importantly,
we do not find any evidence that this treatment may cause
microhaemorrhages in the mouse models used in this study.
It remains entirely possible that direct binding to amyloid
plaques of a F(ab’)2 fragment lacking effector functionality
can contribute to therapeutic efficacy, as suggested by pre-
vious studies using antibody fragments (Bacskai et al.,
2002; Tamura et al., 2005; Wang et al., 2010; Cattepoel
et al., 2011). However, compared to IgG2a, the lower
plasma levels achieved with F(ab’)2 are likely to limit the
efficacy of peripheral ECT-mediated immunization. The
exact role of the effector domain and its interaction with
immune cells expressing Fc receptors, could be determined
by comparing the therapeutic effects of a control antibody
carrying a mutated Fc portion, similar to a previous study
which addressed this question using deglycosylated anti-
amyloid-b antibodies (Wilcock et al., 2006a; Fuller et al.,
2014).
Remarkably,
continuous
administration
of
mAb-11
initiated before plaque deposition had a dramatic effect
on the amyloid pathology in TauPS2APP mice, underlining
the efficacy of preventive anti-amyloid-b treatments. In this
mouse model, where tau hyperphosphorylation is enhanced
by amyloid-b (Grueninger et al., 2010), the treatment de-
creases the number of AT8- and phospho-S422-positive
neurons in the hippocampus. Furthermore, the number of
MC1-positive hippocampal neurons is significantly reduced,
which also indicates an effect of anti-amyloid-b immuno-
therapy on the accumulation of misfolded tau. These results
highlight the effect of amyloid-b clearance on other mani-
festations of the Alzheimer’s pathology. In line with these
findings, previous studies have shown evidence for a de-
crease in tau hyperphosphorylation following immunization
against amyloid-b, both in animal models and in patients
with Alzheimer’s disease (Oddo et al., 2004; Wilcock et al.,
2009; Boche et al., 2010; Serrano-Pozo et al., 2010;
Salloway et al., 2014).
Similar to the subcutaneous injection of recombinant pro-
teins (Schellekens, 2005), ECT implants can elicit signifi-
cant immune responses against the secreted recombinant
antibody. An anti-drug antibody response was detected in
half of the mice treated with the mAb-11-releasing devices,
in the absence of any anti-CD4 treatment. The glycosyla-
tion profile of the mAb-11 synthesized in C2C12 myoblasts
is comparable to standard material produced by myeloma
or HEK293 cells (Lathuiliere et al., 2014a). Although we
cannot exclude that local release by ECT leads to antibody
aggregation and denaturation, it is unlikely that this mode
of administration further contributes to compound im-
munogenicity. Because the Fab regions of the chimeric re-
combinant
mAb-11
IgG2a
contain
human
CDRs,
it
remains to be determined whether the ECT-mediated deliv-
ery of antibodies fully matched with the host species would
trigger an anti-drug antibody response.
Further developments will be needed to scale up this de-
livery system to humans. The possibility of using a single
allogeneic cell source for all intended recipients is a crucial
advantage of the ECT technology to standardize monoclo-
nal antibody delivery. However, the development of renew-
able cell sources of human origin will be essential to ECT
application in the clinic. Although the ARPE-19 cell line
has been successfully adapted to ECT and used in clinical
trials (Dunn et al., 1996; Zhang et al., 2011), the develop-
ment of human myogenic cells (Negroni et al., 2009) is an
attractive alternative that is worth exploring. Based on the
PK analysis of recombinant mAb-11 antibody subcutane-
ously injected in mice (Supplementary material), we esti-
mate that the flat sheet devices chronically release mAb-
11 at a rate of 6.8 and 11.8 mg/h, to reach a plasma
level of 50 mg/ml in the implanted animals. In humans,
injected IgG1 has a longer half-life (21–25 days), with a
volume of distribution of �100 ml/kg and an estimated
clearance of 0.2 ml/h/kg. These values indicate that the pre-
dicted antibody exposure in humans, based on the rate of
mAb-11 secretion achieved by ECT in mice, would be only
10 to 20-fold lower than the typical regimens based on
monthly bolus injection of 1 mg/kg anti-amyloid-b mono-
clonal antibody. Hence, it is realistic to consider ECT for
therapeutic monoclonal antibody delivery in humans, as the
flat sheet device could be scaled up to contain higher
amounts of cells. Furthermore, recent progress to engineer
antibodies for increased penetration into the brain will
enable lowering dosing of biotherapeutics to achieve thera-
peutic efficacy (Bien-Ly et al., 2014; Niewoehner et al.,
2014). For some applications, intrathecal implantation
could be preferred to chronically deliver monoclonal anti-
bodies directly inside the CNS (Aebischer et al., 1996;
Marroquin Belaunzaran et al., 2011).
Overall, ECT provides a novel approach for the local and
systemic delivery of recombinant monoclonal antibodies in
the CNS. It will expand the possible therapeutic options for
immunotherapy against neurodegenerative disorders asso-
ciated with the accumulation of misfolded proteins, includ-
ing Alzheimer’s and Parkinson’s diseases, dementia with
Lewy bodies, frontotemporal lobar dementia and amyo-
trophic lateral sclerosis (Gros-Louis et al., 2010; Bae et
al., 2012; Rosenmann, 2013).
