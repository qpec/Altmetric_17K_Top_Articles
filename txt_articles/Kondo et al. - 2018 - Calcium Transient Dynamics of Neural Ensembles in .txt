In Brief
Kondo et al. demonstrate calcium
imaging from neuronal populations using
a miniature fluorescence microscope in
naturally behaving non-human primates
(NHPs), common marmosets. This
technique marks an advance beyond
methods that use fixed head positioning,
which limits the study of complex, self-
determined behaviors such as social
interactions or fear and anxiety.

SUMMARY
To understand brain circuits of cognitive behaviors
under natural conditions, we developed techniques
for imaging neuronal activities from large neuronal
populations in the deep layer cortex of the naturally
behaving common marmoset. Animals retrieved
food pellets or climbed ladders as a miniature fluo-
rescence microscope monitored hundreds of cal-
cium indicator-expressing cortical neurons in the
right primary motor cortex. This technique, which
can be adapted to other brain regions, can deepen
our understanding of brain circuits by facilitating lon-
gitudinal population analyses of neuronal represen-
tation associated with cognitive naturalistic behav-
iors and their pathophysiological processes.
INTRODUCTION
There is considerable interest in non-human primates (NHPs) as a
neuroscientific model. NHPs can be used to study the neural cir-
cuits underlying social, cognitive, and motor behaviors that are
highly relevant to humans. Two-photon microscopy, in combina-
tion with fluorescent, genetically encoded calcium indicators,
has allowed the visualization of subcellular, single cellular, and
ensemble neural dynamics and has become feasible inhead-fixed
monkeys (Nauhaus et al., 2012; Sadakane et al., 2015a; Seide-
mann et al., 2016; Yamada et al., 2016; Li et al., 2017; Ebina
etal.,2018).However,complexbehaviorsuchassocialinteraction
cannot be properly investigated using head fixation protocols.
Furthermore, neural activities may differentially correlate with be-
haviors under head-fixed conditions compared to more natural
conditions (Ziv and Ghosh, 2015). Miniaturized microscopes, in
conjunction with an implantable microendoscopic lens, have
enabled optical access to deep-brain neural ensembles in freely
moving rodents (Ghosh et al., 2011). Here, we combined an opti-
mized system for adeno-associated virus (AAV) vector expression
of GCaMP with the appropriate microendoscope probe in the
common marmoset (Callithrix jacchus). Thus, we demonstrate
endoscopic miniature microscope imaging of multi-neuronal cal-
cium transients in behaving NHPs.
RESULTS
To monitor task-related neural activity of primary motor cortex
(M1) neurons, we first identified the left M1 via intracortical micro-
stimulation (Figures 1A and S1A–S1C). Then, we injected AAVs
expressing the Ca2+ indicator GCaMP6f (Chen et al., 2013) into
the deep neocortical layers of the arm movement-related region
(Figures S1C–S1H). We took advantage of the tetracycline-
controlled transcriptional activation (Tet) system, an enhanced
gene induction strategy, to sufficiently induce GCaMP6f and sub-
sequently visualize transfected cells using an endoscope (Fig-
ures 1B and S2A). Furthermore, we optimized GCaMP6f levels
by doxycycline (DOX) administration (Figures S2B and S2C).
We developed a monitoring system to track Ca2+ levels in
80–240 cells in a single field of view in individual marmosets
(male, n = 3) (Figure 1C). We tested the system capability during
naturalistic behavior in the marmosets, who engaged in a lever-
pulling task while sitting (Figure 1D), and observed the activity
of
individual
neurons
during
the
task
(Figure

 computationally extracted (Mukamel et al., 2009) the Ca2+ dy-
namics of individual cells from the imaging data and detected
the Ca2+ events (Figures 1E and S3). We found that a subset of
neurons was selectively active at the time during which the right
forearm reached for the lever; other neurons were occasionally
active during the rest period (Figure 1F). Overall, we found an
increased incidence of Ca2+ events (12.5 ± 2.4, mean ± SD) during
the lever-pulling task (Figures 1F and 1G). We next tested different
and more naturalistic behaviors. To adapt to three-dimensional,
rapidly moving marmosets with easily tangled microscope wire,
we subjected the animals to a ladder-climbing task and found a
movement-related increase in Ca2+ event incidence (Figure S4;
Video S1).
What do these M1 neuronal activities encode during natural-
istic voluntary arm movement? To address this question, the
marmosets performed a seated bi-directional arm-reaching
task (Figure 2A). We then employed a computational two-class
discriminator to the neuronal Ca2+ data to decode the arm
movement directions (STAR Methods). In this task, movement-
direction-sensitive Ca2+ exciting neurons were observed during
reaching (Video S2). We used partial least-squares discriminant
analysis (PLS-DA) (Wold et al., 1984) to identify the neurons
involved and the times at which information regarding movement
direction occurred. The reaching movement sequences were
segmented into three periods: before reaching onset (PRE-M),
during reaching movement (MOV), and reaching offset (POST-M)
(Figure 2B). Ca2+ excitation was detected in the MOV phase,
as well as in the absence of arm movement during the PRE-M
and POST-M periods (Figure 2C). PLS-DA, applied to the Ca2+
data acquired during each of the three periods, was able to accu-
rately decode the reaching direction (marmoset M: PRE-M,
83.2% ± 5.4%; MOV, 90.1% ± 3.4%; POST-M, 82.1% ± 7.4%;
mean ± SD) (Figure 2D).
The weight vector am; t in the PLS-DA model, representing the
extent of Ca2+ data contribution in decoding at the mth neuron
and the tth frame, was normalized to a Z score; neurons with a
Z score > 3 (upper 10th percentile during MOV in marmoset M)
were defined as movement-direction-sensitive neurons. The
number of movement-direction-sensitive neurons detected
was 7 in PRE-M (3.42% of identified neurons), 20 in MOV
(9.76%), and 8 in POST-M (3.90%) in marmoset M (see
Table S1 for marmosets W and S). These neurons showed

hemisphere. The microendoscopic lens (nVISTA; Inscopix, Palo Alto, CA) was implanted at the elbow area of M1, which was identified previously via intracortical
microstimulation (ICMS; shown as the vertical blue line).

 time- and phase-locked Ca2+ transients below the event detec-
tion threshold (Figure 2E). None of the other 170 neurons ex-
hibited directional responses (e.g., neuron 110). Decoding using
only these movement-direction-sensitive neurons kept high ac-
curacy (e.g., marmoset M: PRE-M, 92.3% ± 11.9%; MOV,
90.7% ± 9.0%; POST-M, 80.0% ± 12.5%; mean ± SD).
In Figure 2F, we show the anatomical distribution of move-
ment-direction-sensitive neurons. Neurons contributed to neural
decoding in specific periods only (Table S1) and were randomly
distributed anatomically. This suggests that movement-direc-
tion-sensitive neurons in POST-M did not participate in neural
decoding during PRE-M and MOV (Figure S5), and the move-
ment-direction-sensitive neurons in PRE-M and MOV did not
contribute to neural decoding in POST-M (Table S1).
DISCUSSION
We developed a technique for endoscopic miniature microscope
imaging in behaving NHPs, common marmosets, and monitored
motor-related Ca2+ transient dynamics of M1 during several mo-
tor tasks. Using a longer gradient refractive index (GRIN) lens,
the imaging method established in the present study is compat-
ible with studies in imaging deeper brain areas. In addition, we
developed the marmoset ladder apparatus to test a more natu-
ralistic behavior with rapidly, freely moving marmosets. This
apparatus may be expanded to other semi-open field behavioral
procedures, such as the maze task and treadmill task (Foster
et al., 2014). We also monitored motor-related Ca2+ transient dy-
namics of M1 during the bi-directional arm-reaching task. To

(B) Schematic of the task sequence and the period used for neural decoding. A marmoset sat in a chair and volitionally retrieved pellets by reaching one arm. The
sequence of the reaching movement consisted of four periods: resting for a second, reaching one arm to the pellet, pulling back the arm holding the pellet, eating
the pellet, and taking a rest. Ca2+ transient signals from �1.0 to �0.5 s from movement onset were segmented (PRE-M) and used for decoding of the neural signal
movement planning. Ca2+ transient signals from the retrieval onset to 0.5 s after onset were segmented (MOV) and used for decoding of the neural signal
movement execution. Ca2+ transient signals from the reaching offset to 0.5 s after offset were segmented (POST-M) and used for decoding of the neural
signal motor trace.
(C) Examples of calcium imaging in the PRE-M, MOV, and POST-M periods. GCaMP fluorescence changes (arrowheads) were observed in all periods.
(D) Decoding accuracy of movement-direction estimation. Ca2+ transient signals from 200 isolated neurons in marmoset M, 120 neurons in marmoset S, and 241
neurons in marmoset W with respect to the PRE-M, MOV, and POST-M periods and the arm-reaching movement direction (either left or right) was predicted by
partial least-squares discriminant analysis (PLS-DA). Not only Ca2+ events but also all Ca2+ transient signals were used for neural decoding (STAR Methods). As a
control, the movement-direction labels were shuffled and the decoding accuracy was re-calculated, resulting in 50% (chance level). This suggests that the PLS
decoder used in this study worked properly. The error bars denote SD.
(E) Representative Ca2+ transient signals of neurons contributing to movement-direction decoding. Neuron 127 showed movement-direction-sensitive Ca2+
transient in the PRE-M. The Z score assessed signal discrepancy. Similarly, neuron 89 showed movement-direction-sensitive Ca2+ transient in the MOV. Neuron
201 showed movement-direction-sensitive Ca2+ transient in the POST-M. However, neuron 110 showed Ca2+ transients to both right and left directional
movements, and these waveforms were equivalent. No contribution to decoding was made in this case.
(F) Location of movement-direction-sensitive neurons. The results suggest that movement-direction-sensitive neurons in the POST-M did not participate in neural
decoding during the PRE-M and MOV. Neurons contributing to neural decoding in PRE-M, MOV, and POST-M were randomly located, without significant spatial
characteristics.

 date, electrophysiological and fMRI studies indicate that M1 en-
codes information not only in motor planning and execution
(Shenoy et al., 2013) but also in post-processing of movement
(Hadipour-Niktarash et al., 2007; Orban de Xivry et al., 2011; In-
oue et al., 2016). In a two-photon calcium imaging study in ro-
dents, M1 individual neurons exhibited heterogeneous correla-
tions with movement during even a simple lever-pull task
(Peters et al., 2017). In the present study, the bi-directional
arm-reaching task showed that M1 individual neurons exhibited
heterogeneous activity, and we observed reaching movement-
direction-sensitive neurons that were active in the POST-M but
rarely recruited in the PRE-M or MOV. Further insights about
the functional organization of motor cortex during reaching
would be gained by using this technique.
This technology will make it possible to dissect large-scale
neural circuits during human-relevant behavior under natural
conditions, enabling the study of complex behaviors, including
social interaction (Miller et al., 2016), fear, and anxiety (Barros
and Tomaz, 2002; Shiba et al., 2017), and cognitive motor tasks.
Furthermore, the relatively large marmoset brain will enable im-
plantation of a pair of GRIN lenses near brain regions to monitor
two interconnected areas, for example, M1 and the striatum,
without using a complex, specially customized microscope
(Lecoq et al., 2014). Consequently, the combination of this tech-
nique with transgenic marmoset technologies has the potential
to transform our understanding, diagnosis, and treatment of
human brain diseases (Izpisua Belmonte et al., 2015; Okano
et al., 2016).

The locations of the forearm primary motor cortex (M1) area were mapped with ICMS as described previously (Kondo et al., 2015).
Marmosets were anesthetized by intramuscular (i.m.) injection of ketamine (30 mg/kg) and xylazine (2.5 mg/kg). Body temperature
and oxygen saturation levels were monitored. Anesthetized animals were mounted on a custom-made stereotaxic frame
(IMPACT-1000B; Muromachi Kikai, Japan) (Figure S1A), and two polyetheretherketone (PEEK) pipes (Muromachi Kikai, Japan)
were attached to the skull with dental cement (UNIFAST II, GC, Japan). Two pipes were placed in parallel over the frontal and occipital
areas, and both pipes were flanked by small stainless steel bars.
A few days later, the marmosets fitted with head pipes were sedated with an i.m. injection of ketamine (30 mg/kg), atropine sulfate
(0.05 mg/kg), ampicillin (50 mg/kg), and dexamethasone (0.30 mg/kg), and sat in a custom-made stereotaxic chair (Muromachi Kikai,
Japan). The two pipes were used for head fixation- this allowed us to avoid the use of painful tooth/eye and ear bars. Thus, the
marmosets received ICMS under more natural conditions without xylazine treatment (Figure S1B).
A large craniotomy (5 3 5 mm square, without durotomy) was made over the area of the left motor cortex, and tungsten electrodes
were implanted to deliver ICMS (10 biphasic pulses composed of 0.2-ms cathodal and 0.2-ms anodal pulses, at 333 Hz). The location
of the forearm M1 area was estimated based on the observation of evoked forearm motor responses.
After ICMS, the marmosets were anesthetized using 1%–1.5% isoflurane and an AAV solution was injected into two sites (each
site was separated by 1 mm) of the forearm M1 area, 2 mm below the cortical surface. The 500 nL of AAV solution mixture

 (AAV2/1-Thy1S-tTA, 2.0 3 1011 vg/mL; AAV2/1-TRE3-GCaMP6f, 1.0 3 1012 vg/mL) was injected into each site at 100 nL/min through
a glass pipette connected to a microinjector (BJ-110; BEX, Japan). After virus injection, the brain surface was washed with saline to
reduce the production of connective tissue over the dura. Before skull closure, we took pictures of the blood vessel pattern, ICMS
probe trace pattern, and artificial marks made by a rongeur (16621-14; Fine Science Tools, Foster City, CA) (Figure S1C); this
allowed us to identify the AAV injection site later. Artificial dura (5 3 5 mm) (PPX-03060; Gore, Japan) was applied to the brain surface,
a Kwik-Sill� silicone elastomeric adhesive (World Precision Instruments, Sarasota, FL) was mounted, and the scalp was sutured
(Figure S1D).
Lens probe insertion and fixation
A prism probe was implanted into M1 2–3 weeks after AAV injection. Under anesthesia, the scalp was opened and the mounted Kwik-
Sil� and artificial dura were removed. After careful removal of connective tissues on the dura, a deep incision (2 mm in depth) was
made over the dura along with the line flanked by AAV injection tracks (approximately 1 mm in length) using a sharp surgical blade,
and a durotomy was made in a square where one of the sides was incised deeply. Durotomy was performed only at the probe inser-
tion site (�1 3 1 mm); then, to stabilize the inserted probe and reduce brain tissue damage and vessel disruption due to pulsation, the
probe was affixed with dental cement (Figure S1E).
The prism probe (1.0 mm in diameter, 4.3 mm in length) (1050-002203; Inscopix, Palo Alto, CA) was attached to the lens implant
kit (ProView, 1050-002334; Inscopix, Palo Alto, CA) connected to an endoscope. The edge of the prism was aligned on the incision
(Figure S1E) and the prism was inserted until a GCaMP fluorescence signal was detected (�2.3-mm depth). At this position, the probe
was fixed to the skull with Metabond� (C&B, Parkell, NY) (Figure S1F). Then the probe top was covered with Kwik-Cast (World
Precision Instruments, Sarasota, FL) after the endoscope was disconnected.
An endoscope base plate was attached to the skull using dental cement 3–6 weeks after probe insertion. This varied due to the
time needed for recovery from the surgical procedures, and the appearance of clearly defined outlines of cell bodies and vessels
(Figure S1G). Each marmoset required an endoscope, base plate, and probe lens for imaging (Figure S1G); the base plate cover
remained affixed after imaging (Figure S1H).
AAV production and purification
AAV vectors were produced using the AAV Helper-Free System (Agilent Technologies, Inc., Santa Clara, CA). Detailed methods used
for AAV production and purification were described previously (Konishi et al., 2008). pAAV-Thy1s-tTA and pAAV TRE3-GCaMP6f
plasmids were used to produce AAV (Sadakane et al., 2015b).
Doxycycline (DOX) treatment
DOX (D9891; Sigma Aldrich, St. Louis, MO) was administered orally using a syringe (2 mg of DOX in 20 mL of 20% honey-syrup so-
lution). To ensure GCaMP expression control by DOX, we checked the GCaMP expression level 3 d after the first administration; an
extra 1 mg of DOX was administered as needed. Then, 1 mg of DOX was administered approximately once per month to maintain the
desired GCaMP expression levels.
Ladder-climbing task
The ladder apparatus comprised side walls made of clear Plexiglas (1.4 m in height) and wood rungs (4 mm in diameter), with a dis-
tance of 4 cm between rungs (Figure S4A). The marmosets were trained to climb the ladder from a carrying cage at the bottom to
another carrying cage at the top. Then the carrying cage containing the marmoset was moved to the bottom, and the marmoset
began climbing again. To climb up the apparatus (1 session), each hand needed to grip the rungs 5–8 times. The marmosets
were pre-trained on the ladder-climbing task before neural recording. Pre-training was performed over 3–5 d (5–10 sessions per
day), and testing began when the marmosets climbed up without stopping or turning around.
Lever-pull and pellet retrieval tasks
Each marmoset was trained to wear a custom-made jacket with a Velcro strip, which was used to attach the marmoset to a back plate
with a rigid bar (Figure 1D). Each marmoset was habituated for 1–2 weeks so that they would remain calm during the tasks. After
successful habituation, the marmosets were trained to perform the following tasks before neural recording.
Lever-pull task: The grip (ball-shaped, 8 mm in diameter) of the lever was located 30 mm in front of the marmoset’s right hand (Fig-
ure 1D). The animals were pre-trained to pull the lever horizontally. Each marmoset performed the task �20 times, once per day.
Pellet-reaching task: The pellet (sweet marshmallow, 5 mm in diameter) was placed 30 mm in front and 45� to the right or left side of
the home position (Figure 2A). Once a pellet was retrieved, the marmoset needed to wait 3 s, and the next pellet was placed on the
other side. Each marmoset performed the task 40 times, once per day.
Data processing
Calcium imaging data were acquired using a miniaturized fluorescence microscope (nVista; Inscopix, Palo Alto, CA) at 20 frames/s.
The acquired images were spatially downsampled by a factor of 2 using Mosaic software (Inscopix, Palo Alto, CA). We then per-
formed rigid image registration to correct for lateral brain displacement using the Mosaic software. To normalize the fluorescence

 signals to the average fluorescence of the frame, we calculated registered images as percent change (DF) over baseline (F): DF(t)/F =
(F(t) – F)/F. Ca2+ transients from individual cells, which predominantly reflect action potentials with a minor contribution from
subthreshold potentials (Berger et al., 2007), were identified with established cell-sorting algorithm based on principal component
analysis (PCA) and independent component analysis (ICA) (Mukamel et al., 2009). Noted here that PCA-ICA algorithm, as its nature,
minimizes signal contaminations from nearby cells or movement-related artifacts (Figure S3). This automated independent compo-
nent sorting algorithm was used widely in the regions of hippocampus (Xia et al., 2017), sensorimotor cortex (Wang et al., 2017) and
other multiple regions in rodents.
QUANTIFICATION AND STATISTICAL ANALYSIS
Detection of spike events from Ca2+ transients
For each selected calcium transient trace from a single cell, we subtracted the median trace (20 s sliding window) to minimize
negligible fluctuations from baseline. Further, an estimate of the amplitude of fluctuation from baseline was calculated using median
absolute deviation (MAD):
MAD = medianið
�
�Xi � medianjðXjÞ
�
� Þ;
where i and j take the values 1, 2, 3..., nframes, and Xi is the intensity of the signal at the i-th frame. MAD is a statistical distribution that is
more resilient to outliers in a dataset than the standard deviation. Using the calculated MAD for each trace, calcium events were de-
tected as follows.
First, the algorithm identified the event timing t, where the slope of Xt turns from positive to negative. These positive peaks were
classified as candidate Ca2+ events. Next, the algorithm identified the most previous event from these positive peaks, where the
slope of Xt turns from negative to positive. The MAD value was added to the amplitude of these troughs, and the value was defined
as the Ca2+ event detection threshold for the subsequent peaks. The positive peaks exceeding this threshold were treated as Ca2+
events.
A blinded visual inspection was finally performed to confirm that the detected Ca2+ spikes from a single cell were segregated from
the signals of neighboring neurons.
Partial least-squares discriminant analysis (PLS-DA)
There are many available statistical tools to model experimental biodata; therefore, a model must be chosen carefully while consid-
ering the theoretical assumptions. M1 neurons synchronously fire in milliseconds, and coherently oscillate together at approximately
20 Hz during physical movement. Therefore, it is highly likely that Ca2+ dynamics of M1 neurons exhibit multicollinearity. There was no
prior knowledge regarding data distribution, as the present study was the first to analyze Ca2+ dynamics of M1 neurons in naturally
behaving NHPs. Model interpretability is also needed to determine the physiological relevance of the results. Hence, we used
PLS-DA to decode movement direction from Ca2+ dynamics of M1 neurons during bi-directional arm reaching.
PLS regression combines features of principal component analysis and multiple linear regression, and thereby transforms a set of
correlated explanatory variables into a new set of variables that are orthogonal to each other, which is appropriate in the presence of
multicollinearity (Wold et al., 1984). PLS is a mathematical estimation approach that builds a model by sequentially adding data points
such that model parameters are continuously updated. PLS-DA performs a PLS regression with a dichotomous dependent variable,
and is used for classification tasks. PLS-DA is a standard tool in chemometrics, and has been applied to other classification problems
in science due to its applicability to multicollinearity and result interpretation (Pe
´ rez-Enciso and Tenenhaus, 2003).
Other standard models did not fit the present study, as automated variable selection procedures for logistic regression or linear
discriminant analyses generate unstable prediction models in the presence of multicollinearity. When there is no prior knowledge
regarding data distribution, the k-nearest neighbors algorithm is useful but is very sensitive to irrelevant variables and multicollinearity
because all variables contribute equally to the model. Multilayer perceptron and support vector machine are not severely affected by
multicollinearity but model interpretability is very low.
Decoding arm-reaching movement direction using PLS-DA
To predict the arm movement direction DðiÞ in the i-th trial during bi-directional reaching, the filtered neural Ca2+ transient signal data
were pooled as the two-dimensional vector, Am;tðiÞ, where m is the neuron ID, and t is time; this describes the neural and temporal
information of the i-th trial. The goal of decoding was to estimate a set of weights fa0; am;tg so DðiÞ could be modeled as their linear
combination with Am;tðiÞ

 where a0 is the intercept, am;t is the weight of the component at that neuron ID and time, and εðiÞ is the residual error at the i-th trial.
The optimal number of PLS components for this recoding model was 10, determined by the minimal predictive error sum of squares.
For the decoding directions, 23 of 38 trials (Marmoset M), 25 of 41 trials (Marmoset S), and 11 of 18 trials (Marmoset W) were used as
training datasets, and the rest were used as test datasets for validation. The decoding was performed 10,000 times repeatedly with
different combinations of train-and-test datasets to estimate a proper accuracy rate. The accuracy rate was quantified by deter-
mining the percentage of trials in which the actual and predicted directions were the same.
Weights of the prediction model, shown in the following Equation (2), were analyzed to evaluate the contribution of individual neu-
rons to the prediction of movement direction

where j, j represents the absolute value of ,, and WðmÞ quantifies the percentage contribution of the m-th neuron for decoding.
Neural order shuffling
To ensure the decoding performance, a shuffling analysis was performed after each decoding model was acquired. For each exper-
iment, surrogate validation datasets were generated, and the decoding model obtained previously from the training data was used to
make a prediction on these surrogate validation data. The expected accuracy was 50% in this case. In neural order shuffling, the
neuron ID of the validation data was randomly shuffled, while the sample order remained unchanged.
