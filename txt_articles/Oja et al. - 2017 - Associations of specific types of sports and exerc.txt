ABSTRACT
Background/Aim Evidence for the long-term health
effects of specific sport disciplines is scarce. Therefore,
we examined the associations of six different types of
sport/exercise with all-cause and cardiovascular disease
(CVD) mortality risk in a large pooled Scottish and
English population-based cohort.
Methods Cox proportional hazards regression was
used to investigate the associations between each
exposure and all-cause and CVD mortality with
adjustment for potential confounders in 80 306
individuals (54% women; mean±SD age: 52±14 years).
Results Significant reductions in all-cause mortality
were observed for participation in cycling (HR=0.85,
95% CI 0.76 to 0.95), swimming (HR=0.72, 95% CI
0.65 to 0.80), racquet sports (HR=0.53, 95% CI 0.40 to
0.69) and aerobics (HR=0.73, 95% CI 0.63 to 0.85).
No significant associations were found for participation
in football and running. A significant reduction in CVD
mortality was observed for participation in swimming
(HR=0.59, 95% CI 0.46 to 0.75), racquet sports
(HR=0.44, 95% CI 0.24 to 0.83) and aerobics
(HR=0.64, 95% CI 0.45 to 0.92), but there were no
significant associations for cycling, running and football.
Variable dose–response patterns between the exposure
and the outcomes were found across the sport
disciplines.
Conclusions These findings demonstrate that
participation in specific sports may have significant
benefits for public health. Future research should aim to
further strengthen the sport-specific epidemiological
evidence base and understanding of how to promote
greater sports participation.
BACKGROUND
It is well established that physical activity (PA) has
multiple cardiometabolic health benefits.1 This evi-
dence comes largely from studies focusing on
leisure-time PAs and active travel.2–5
Epidemiological cohort studies have suggested
that sports participation is associated with reduced
mortality among middle-aged and older adults.
Samitz et al6 systematically reviewed 80 studies
with
1 338 143
participants
for
associations
between PA and risk of all-cause mortality. The
domain ‘vigorous exercise and sports’ showed the
largest reduction in risk of all-cause mortality
(RR=0.78) followed by ‘moderate and vigorous
leisure-time activities’ (RR 0.86), ‘moderate activ-
ities
of
daily
living’
(RR=0.90),
‘walking’
(RR=0.93) and ‘PA for transportation’ (RR=0.92).
It has been suggested that vigorous-intensity PA,
that is inherent to many types of sports and exer-
cise, may have a higher impact on reducing all-
cause mortality risk than nonvigorous activities.7
Although sport is often cited as a contributor to
public health, the nature and scope of this relation-
ship remains unclear, particularly with regard to
specific sport disciplines.
A recent systematic review of cross-sectional,
cohort
and
intervention
studies
examined
the
health benefits of 26 specific sport disciplines.8 The
most commonly studied sport disciplines were
jogging/running, football, gymnastics, recreational
cycling and swimming. According to established
criteria for assessing the strength of evidence,9
there was moderate evidence for health benefits of
jogging/running and recreational football and less
than moderate evidence for all other sport disci-
plines. This review concluded that the existing evi-
dence remains fragmentary and is compromised by
weak study designs.
The aim of the present study was to examine: (1)
the independent associations between participation
in common types of sports and exercise and all-
cause and cardiovascular disease (CVD) mortality;
and (2) the graded exposure–response character-
istics of these associations in a pooled analysis of
10 general population cohorts of adults in England
and Scotland.
METHODS
Sample
The Health Survey for England (HSE) and the
Scottish Health Survey (SHeS) are household-based
general population studies recruiting independent
samples annually since 1991 (HSE) and periodic-
ally (SHeS) since 1995. Sampling is based on a
multistage, stratified probability design aimed at a
nationally
representative
sample
of
individuals
living in households.10 11 Interviewers visited the
sampled households and administered the study
questionnaire and measured height and weight.
Each baseline data collection was approved by the
relevant Research Ethics Committees in England
and Scotland. All participants provided written
consent to have their names flagged by the NHS
Central Mortality Register. The present analysis
included individuals aged 30–98 years from the
HSE
1994,
1997,
1998,
1999,
2003,
2004,
2006
and
2008
and
from
the
SHeS
1995,
1998 and 2003, with corresponding linkage to
mortality data. For details of data acquisition and
linkage see ref. 12

 Physical activity assessment
Non-occupational PA was assessed using an established question-
naire that inquired about the frequency and duration of partici-
pation in domestic PA (heavy manual housework, gardening and
‘do-it-yourself’ activities), walking and sports and exercise in
the 4 weeks prior to the interview.13 Prompt cards were
employed for sports and exercises that contained a number of
groupings, including cycling (for any purpose), swimming, aer-
obics/keep
fit/gymnastics/dance
for
fitness,
running/jogging,
football/rugby, badminton/tennis and squash. For each positive
response participants were asked to specify frequency (‘Can you
tell me on how many separate days did you do [activity name]
for at least 15 min a time during the past 4 weeks?’), duration
(‘How much time did you usually spend doing [activity name]
on each day?’) and perceived relative intensity (‘Was the effort
usually enough to make you out of breath or sweaty?’). The con-
vergent validity of the questionnaire has been examined against
accelerometry in a study of over 2000 adults. Spearman’s correl-
ation between questionnaire and accelerometer-based estimates
of MVPA was 0.42 in men (95% CI 0.36 to 0.48) and 0.38 in
women (95% CI 0.32 to 0.45).13
Mortality outcomes
Surviving participants were censored on December 2009 (SHeS)
or February 2011 (HSE). Primary causes of death were diag-
nosed according to the International Classification of Diseases
(ICD) using the ninth (ICD-9) and tenth revisions (ICD-10).
CVD codes recorded from the ICD were 390–459 and 101–
199 from the ninth and tenth revision, respectively (for details
see ref. 12).
Covariates
Height and weight were measured using standard protocols that
have been previously described;12 body mass index (BMI) was cal-
culated as weight (in kilograms) divided by height (in metres)
squared. Additional questions assessed education level (age finished
education), weekly frequency of alcohol consumption, psycho-
logical distress/depression (12-item General Health Questionnaire
score–GHQ-12), smoking status (current, ex, never), presence of
limiting long-standing illness and existing doctor-diagnosed CVD
(angina, stroke, coronary heart disease) and cancer.
Data handling and statistical analyses
The exposure measures were participation in cycling for any
purpose (termed ‘cycling’); swimming; aerobics/keep fit/gymnas-
tics/dance
for
fitness
(termed
‘aerobics’);
running/jogging
(termed ‘running’); football/rugby (termed ‘football’) and bad-
minton/tennis/squash combined (termed ‘racquet sports’). Other
sports were considered but were not included in analysis,
because of insufficient statistical power resulting from low par-
ticipation rates. The associations between each exposure and
mortality were examined in terms of:
A. overall participation (none/any);
B. relative
perceived
intensity
(none/lower
intensity/higher
intensity) with the responses to the questions ‘Was the effort
usually enough to make you out of breath or sweaty?’ deter-
mining lower versus higher intensity;
C. weekly
duration
(none/low/high)
using
the
sex-specific
medians of weekly times reported by participators for each
exposure as cut-offs that denote low versus high duration
(see online supplementary table S1 for cut-off values);
D. weekly
intensity-weighted
volume
(metabolic
equivalent
(MET)-hours/week) calculated using the PA Compendium14
to assign a MET of activity and considering reported infor-
mation
on
frequency,
duration
and
relative
intensity.
Sex-specific medians of weekly volumes (MET-hours/week)
were used as cut-offs that denote low versus high volume
for each sport (see online supplementary table S1).
Baseline characteristics were summarised by sex. Cox propor-
tional hazards regression was used to investigate the association
between each exposure and all-cause and CVD mortality.
Log-minus-log plots were used to examine proportional hazards
assumptions. Selection of covariates was guided by previous lit-
erature and multivariate analyses were adjusted for age and sex
(Model 1), and additionally adjusted for long-standing illness,
alcohol drinking frequency, psychological distress (GHQ-12
score >3), BMI, smoking status, education level, doctor-
diagnosed CVD (all-cause mortality analyses only) and weekly
PA volume (MET-hours/week excluding the volume of the sport
that was the main exposure in the corresponding model).
Participants
who
had
doctor-diagnosed
CVD
at
baseline
(angina, stroke, IHD) were excluded from the analyses with
CVD mortality as outcome. The linear and quadratic trend p
values were reported for each model. In sensitivity analyses, par-
ticipants
who
experienced
events
occurring
in
the
first
24 months of follow-up were excluded. Sensitivity analyses were
also conducted to check the possible ‘overadjustment’ by BMI
in Model 2. As no appreciable differences were found BMI was
retained in the main analyses. No participation was always used
as the reference category. Analyses were carried out with SPSS
V
.22 (SPSS, Chicago, Illinois, USA), with the level of statistical
significance set at p<0.05.
RESULTS
The baseline characteristics are shown in table 1. In total, our
analysis included 80 306 individuals with 43 705 women (mean
age=52±15 years) and 36 601 men (mean age=52±14 years).
Overall, 44.3% of the participants (43.1% of women and
45.6% of men) met national PA guidelines. The most common
sport/exercise activity was swimming, followed by cycling, aer-
obics, running, racquet sports and football.
Over an average follow-up of 9.2±4.3 years (corresponding
to 736 463 person-years), 8790 deaths from any cause occurred.
Among the 75 014 participants who did not report doctor-
diagnosed CVD at the baseline and were therefore entered in
the
CVD
mortality
analyses
(9.2±4.5 years
of
follow-up/
693 757 person-years), there were 1909 CVD deaths.
All-cause mortality
T
able 2 shows multivariate analyses of the association between
exposure to specific sports and risk of all-cause mortality.
In the most adjusted model compared with no participation
in each activity: cycling participation was associated with a sig-
nificantly reduced risk of all-cause mortality of 15% (HR=0.85,
95% CI 0.76 to 0.95). Swimming participation was associated
with a significantly reduced risk of all-cause mortality of 28%
(HR=0.72, 95% CI 0.65 to 0.80). Running participation was
not associated with a significant reduction in risk of all-cause
mortality (HR=0.87, 95% CI 0.68 to 1.11). Likewise, football
participation was not associated with a significantly reduced risk
for all-cause mortality (HR=0.82, 95% CI 0.61 to 1.11).
Racquet sports participation was associated with a significant
reduced risk of all-cause mortality of 47% (HR=0.53, 95% CI
0.40 to 0.69). Aerobics participation was associated with a sig-
nificant reduced risk for all-cause mortality of 27% (HR=0.73,
95% CI 0.63 to 0.85).

 Cardiovascular disease mortality
Table 3 shows multivariate analyses of the association between
participation in specific sports and risk for CVD mortality.
In the most adjusted model compared with no participation
in each activity: cycling participation was not associated with a
reduced risk for CVD mortality (HR=0.93, 95% CI 0.76 to
1.16). Swimming participation was associated with a significant
reduced risk of CVD mortality of 41% (HR=0.59, 95% CI
0.46 to 0.75). Running participation (HR=0.81, 95% CI 0.47
to 1.39) and football participation (HR=0.90, 95% CI 0.49 to
1.64) were not associated with a significantly reduced risk of
CVD. Racquet sports participation was associated with a signifi-
cant reduced risk of CVD mortality of 56% (HR=0.44, 95% CI
0.24 to 0.83). Aerobics participation was associated with a sig-
nificant reduced risk of CVD mortality of 36% (HR=0.64,
95% CI 0.45 to 0.92).
Dose–response analysis
Online supplementary tables S2 and S3 show the results of the
dose–response analyses for all-cause and CVD mortality, respect-
ively. Mixed dose response relationships were obtained for dif-
ferent sport disciplines. Some showed a significant linear trend
(indicating that reduction in mortality risk increased with higher
intensity, duration and/or volume of sport participation), some
showed a significant U-shaped relationship (indicating that
lower intensity is more beneficial than high intensity or no par-
ticipation), while some provided no indication of dose–response
relationship. Fewer significant dose–response associations were
found for CVD mortality compared with all-cause mortality.
DISCUSSION
In the present large population-based pooled cohort study, we
examined the independent associations of the six most com-
monly practiced types of sport or exercise in Scotland and
England with all-cause and CVD mortality. Swimming, aerobics
and racquet sports were associated with significantly reduced
risk of all-cause and CVD mortality. Cycling was associated with
significantly reduced risk of all-cause mortality, but not CVD
mortality. Our data did not show evidence of significant associ-
ation with mortality risk for participation in running or
football.
As noted, we conducted these analyses in response to a
limited number of previous findings for specific sports/exercise.8
This limited the number of comparisons we could make.
Considering some notable results, at a specific activity level,
our cycling and all-cause mortality result compares well with a
2014 systematic review and meta-analysis of eight studies that
yielded a 10% risk reduction (95% CI 6% to 13%) for cycling
at a standardised dose of 11.25 MET-hours per week.5 W
e
would suggest our result further confirms the likely magnitude
of effect for cycling.
For swimming, a previous systematic review8 identified three
cohort studies and one intervention study, but the evidence for
all-cause mortality, CVD mortality and adiposity was inconclu-
sive. In contrast, in the present study, swimming participation
showed large and significant associations with all-cause and
CVD mortality; 28% and 41% risk reduction, respectively.
The association between jogging/running and all-cause mor-
tality among healthy adults has previously been addressed by
four large-scale population-based cohort studies.15–18 The find-
ings have been consistent in showing a significant risk reduction
in all-cause and/or CVD mortality. The found significant reduc-
tions in all-cause mortality were 39%,15 30%,16 44%17 and
27% and in CVD mortality 45%.16 Our results showed a signifi-
cant 43% (95% CI 27% to 55%) reduction in all-cause mortal-
ity risk among runners compared with non-runners according
to the age/sex-adjusted model, but a non-significant 13% reduc-
tion in the fully adjusted model. A similar pattern was shown
for CVD mortality. The fully adjusted associations in the present
study are smaller than those reported in the previous studies,

 and also statistically non-significant. This was a surprising
finding, and we have considered a number of possible explana-
tions. In our data, there were a relatively low number of mortal-
ity events in the exposure group which contributed to wide CIs
and perhaps the non-significant HRs. Previous studies have also
assessed running participation over longer recall periods16–18
than the current study. It might be that the recall period of
4 weeks used in the current study was not long enough to differ-
entiate long-term and transient behaviour possibly resulting in
misclassification of participants. It seems therefore that while
not significant, our result adds to the body of evidence support-
ing beneficial effects of jogging/running on all-cause and CVD
mortality rather than contradicting it.
Football showed a non-significant reduction in risk of all-
cause and CVD mortality. These non-significant associations
were somewhat unexpected, as the evidence from controlled
intervention studies in a systematic review indicates that partici-
pation in recreational football improves aerobic fitness and car-
diovascular function at rest and reduces adiposity among
previously inactive adults.8 Our finding may reflect the low
prevalence of football in the study population (0.3% among
women, 6.4% among men) and the consequent weaker statis-
tical power in the analyses. W
e did additional analyses including
only men and the HR (Model 2) remained non-significant for
all-cause
and
CVD
mortality
(see
online
supplementary
table S4).
Participation in racquet sports (including badminton, tennis
and squash) showed significant risk reduction of 47% in all-
cause mortality and 59% reduction in CVD mortality. To the
best of our knowledge little comparable data are available. A
previous systematic review8 identified two studies on tennis and
two on squash. One on tennis was a prospective cohort study,19
which showed decreased CVD risk among tennis players but no
effect among racquetball players.
Strong and significant associations were found for all-cause
and CVD mortality with aerobics participation (including aer-
obics, keep fit, gymnastics and dance for fitness). Additional
analysis including only women indicated more marked reduc-
tion in CVD mortality compared with combined group analysis
(50% versus 36%) (see online supplementary table S4) Aerobic
dance has been shown to be associated with improved cardio-
respiratory fitness20 and this in turn with reduced mortality
risk.21 However, the direct link between participation in aerobic
dance and mortality has not been previously investigated.
In order to place these observations in the context of overall
PA, we have adjusted the analyses for meeting versus not
meeting PA recommendations and for doing any sport versus
doing no sport. The adjusted HRs for all-cause mortality were

These results suggest that compared with meeting the generic
PA guidelines (which also consider walking), doing any sport
appears to
be
equally
protective
for all-cause
and
CVD
mortality.
W
e tested for interaction by age (year 50 as cut-point), sex
and PA level (meeting the PA recommendations versus not
meeting them) of each sport participation by entering an inter-
action term in each fully adjusted model. With the exception of
aerobics (sex interaction p=0.022) and cycling (PA level inter-
action p=0.036 for all-cause mortality and p=0.012 for CVD
mortality), there were no interactions by age (p≥0.155), sex
(p≥0.101) or adherence to PA recommendations (p≥0.211).
Cycling appears to be more beneficial among inactive people for
ACM and CVD (data available on request).
Mixed results were obtained for the dose–response relation-
ship between participation in different types of sports and exer-
cise and mortality. For running, we observed no significant
dose–response gradient, which is in accordance with some previ-
ous findings.16 There was some indication of ‘U’-shaped dose–
response relationships between cycling, swimming and racquet
sports participation and mortality, similar as in, for example,
Schnohr et al17 and W
ang et al.18 There is an ongoing scientific
debate about the shape of the dose–response relationship
between PA and mortality, with strong arguments supporting
both opposing views. Some contend that the relationship is ‘U’
shaped,22 23 while others argue it is linear.24 25 Our results indi-
cate variable patterns between the dose (intensity, weekly dur-
ation, weekly volume) of sport participation and the outcomes
and highlight the need for further investigation.
It should be noted from tables 2 and 3 that the median age at
death in groups with ‘any’ sport participation is considerably
lower than in the ‘none’ groups. This could initially signal that
participation leads to earlier death. However, we offer an alter-
native explanation of this phenomenon. At baseline, the median
age for the ‘any participation’ groups is considerably lower than
the ‘none’ groups. This means that after 10-year follow-up, the
‘any’ group is still considerably younger. This drives the phe-
nomenon that the median age at deaths in the ‘any’ group is
lower as it is derived from a younger sample.
The strengths of the present study include the large popula-
tion representative sample with genders and a wide age range.
T
o the best of our knowledge this is the largest existing data set
reporting sport and exercise-specific associations with mortality

W
e
used
extensive
national
register-based
mortality
follow-up assessed independently. For the exposure assessment a
validated questionnaire was used. The analyses controlled for a
comprehensive set of covariates, although we cannot discount
the possibility of residual confounding.
This study was not without limitations. First, the small
number of events impaired the statistical power in some ana-
lyses. There were relatively few deaths due to all causes among
runners and football players, which may explain the wide CIs in
the final adjusted model. The number of CVD deaths was rather
small among all sport/exercise participants and may reflect the
weaker associations especially in the maximally adjusted model
results. Nevertheless, the associations remained robust for swim-
ming, racquet sports and aerobics. Second, seasonality remains
an important issue in PA research, and particularly in our case
investigating sports that may have defined on and off seasons.
The surveys that we used employed sampling over a 12-month
period to account for this issue, but some misclassification and
resulting regression dilution may have reduced the strength of
associations observed. Third, the relatively short recall period
used for the assessment of the sport participation may have led
to additional misclassification in terms of the long-term stability
of the participation. Fourth, the repeat cross-sectional nature of
the survey data available meant we could not assess or account
for changes in participation within individuals. Finally, using
mortality as an outcome may miss social and mental health ben-
efits
or
reductions
in
morbidity
conferred
by
sports
participation.
The findings add to the existing body of knowledge suggest-
ing that sport participation is likely to have important potential
to promote public health. Future research should use well-
designed cohort studies to strengthen the evidence based on
the associations between sport participation and mortality and
morbidity, and also consider longitudinal changes in participa-
tion behaviour; conduct intervention studies to investigate if
health benefits of these and other sport disciplines are truly
causal in nature and find more effective ways of increasing
population-level
sports
participation
if
the
benefits
are
confirmed.
CONCLUSIONS
We found robust associations between participation in certain
types of sport and exercise and mortality, indicating substan-
tial reductions in all-cause and CVD mortality for swimming,
racquet sports and aerobics and in all-cause mortality for
cycling. The growing evidence should support the sport com-
munity to develop and promote health-enhancing sport pro-
grammes to reach more people and contribute to greater
proportion of population meeting the PA guidelines for
health.
What are the findings?
We found robust evidence that adults’ participation in
swimming, basketball and aerobics is associated with reduced
all-cause and cardiovascular mortality and participation in
cycling with that of all-cause mortality.
How might it impact on clinical practice in the future?
These new observations with other existing evidence should
support the clinicians to consider sports participation as an
effective form of health-enhancing physical activity.
