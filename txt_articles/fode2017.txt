 Approximately 30% of all men >40 years experience 
erectile dysfunction (ED) and the prevalence of ED 
increases with age1. The condition can have considerable 
negative effects on quality of life for both the men and 
their partners2. Several treatments are available, includ-
ing oral phosphodiesterase type 5 inhibitors (PDE5I), 
vacuum pumps, intraurethral medications, penile injec-
tion therapy, and — as a last resort — penile implants1. 
However, these treatments do not cure the underlying 
pathology and the results are not always satisfactory. 
They also carry risks of adverse effects or complications, 
and most available treatments take the spontaneity out 
of sex, as intimacy needs to be planned according to 
application and onset of the effect. This situation can 
feel unnatural to some patients and their partners and, 
therefore, curative treatments are highly desirable3. Over 
the past decade, low-intensity extracorporeal shockwave 
therapy (Li-ESWT) has emerged as a promising option 
for the treatment of ED4.
Li-ESWT is a noninvasive technique that uses the 
targeted passage of acoustic waves through tissues or 
organs to induce the desired effects. The technology 
was originally introduced as a noninvasive treatment 
for kidney stones4 and has since been used in the 
manage 
ment of many other conditions including bone 
fractures, musculo 
skeletal disorders, cardiovascular 
disease, and wound healing5. The exact mechanism of 
action of Li-ESWT in ED is unknown, but energy from 
the acoustic waves is hypothesized to activate cellular 
pathways that increase the expression of local growth 
factors, improving endothelial function, angiogenesis, 
and perhaps even regeneration of nerve fibres6,7.
The major advantage of Li-ESWT treatment is 
 
the possibility to restore natural erections; Li-ESWT 
is the only marketed treatment for ED that has the 
potential for cure. Li-ESWT has also been suggested 
to improve the effect of PDE5I in men who have pre-
viously not responded to this treatment, negating the 
need to consider more invasive treatments8. Although 
convincing effects have not been reported in all studies, 
enthusiasm for using Li-ESWT for ED remains high, and 
a substantial amount of scientific research on its use has

Low-intensity shockwave therapy for 
erectile dysfunction: is the evidence 
strong enough?

Abstract | Erectile dysfunction (ED) affects ~30% of all men above the age of 40 years and its 
prevalence steadily increases with age. Current nonsurgical treatment options, including 
phosphodiesterase type 5 inhibitors (PDE5I), provide temporary relief but have failed to provide a 
permanent improvement of the condition. Low-intensity extracorporeal shockwave therapy 
(Li-ESWT) is noninvasive and uses acoustic waves, which can pass through tissue and be focussed 
to target specific areas or organs to induce the desired effects. The use of Li-ESWT has previously 
been described in other disease contexts, such as ischaemic heart disease, bone fractures, and 
burns, in which it improves neoangiogenesis; similar principles seem to apply in the erectile tissue. 
The major potential advantage of the treatment, therefore, is the possibility to restore natural 
erectile function. Thus, Li-ESWT is the only currently marketed treatment for ED that might offer a 
cure, which is the most desired outcome for most men with ED. Li-ESWT has also been suggested 
to improve the effect of PDE5I in nonresponders, reducing the need for more invasive treatments. 
Several single-arm trials have shown benefit of Li-ESWT on patient-reported erectile function 
scores, but data from randomized trials are conflicting, and many questions remain to be answered 
before we can routinely offer this treatment to patients. Thus, the search for the true clinical value 
of Li-ESWT for ED represents a dynamic and continuing field of enquiry.

 Electrohydraulic
Shockwaves are generated by 
high voltage discharging to a 
spark plug in an underwater 
source.
Electromagnetic
Electromagnetic shockwave 
generation is based on the 
physical principle of 
electromagnetic induction,  
as used, for example, in 
loudspeakers.
Piezoelectric
Piezo elements are arranged 
on a spherical surface and are 
synchronously excited by an 
electrical pulse to emit a 
pressure wave in the direction 
of the centre of the spherical 
surface.
Piezomagnetic
Analogous to the piezoelectric 
shockwave generator, but 
instead of an electrical pulse, 
physical deformation of the 
piezo elements is achieved by 
applying a magnetic field.
emerged. This Review explores the rationale and mecha-
nisms behind Li-ESWT and considers the data regarding 
its use in patients with ED in order to provide clinical 
recommendations and identify future research goals.
Mechanism of action
Shockwaves and their effects on tissues
A shockwave is a longitudinal acoustic wave consisting of 
a short pulse of about 5 μs duration that is characterized 
by a near instantaneous jump to a peak positive acoustic 
pressure, which is referred to as a ‘shock’
, followed by a 
longer-lasting period of negative pressure9. The ampli-
tude of the negative pressure is always much less than 
that of the peak positive pressure, and no abrupt pres-
sure transition is observed in the negative phase of the 
waveform9 (FIG. 1). The shape and amplitude of the waves 
and their effects on tissues to which they are applied can 
differ depending on the machine used to generate the 
waves (electrohydraulic, electromagnetic, piezoelectric or 
 
piezomagnetic). Shockwaves exert stress in tissues via two 
main mechanisms: the first is direct mechanical stress 
associated with the high- 
amplitude shockwave itself, and 
the second is associated with the growth and violent col-
lapse of so-called cavitation bubbles in fluid. Interestingly, 
cavitation is more likely to result in injury within blood 
vessels than within the surrounding tissue, as a bubble 
surrounded by tissue will be constrained and will not be 
able to go through a violent growth-and-collapse cycle. 
In a blood vessel, the fluid environment enables the bub-
bles to grow and collapse. This phenomenon is consistent 
with the observation that damage occurs first in the cap-
illaries, which, owing to their small size, will be subject to 
greater stresses than larger vessels during the most explo-
sive part of the growth cycle (FIG. 2), causing shear stress 
and damage to the endothelium. Shear stress and endo-
thelial damage are well described factors resulting in neo-
vascularization and, indeed, shockwave therapy has been 
shown to induce the formation of new blood vessels10,11.
Neoangiogenesis. In 1990, Young and Dyson12 dis-
covered that therapeutic ultrasonography encourages 
angio 
genesis in superficial wounds in Wistar rats. 
Using microfocal X-ray techniques, they reported 
an increase in the number of vessels detected in the 
wound area after five daily sessions of low-intensity 
ultrasonography. A 2012 study used intravital fluores-
cent microscopy to show that the application of shock-
waves to full-thickness burns in mice ears reduced 
the nonperfused area, indicating neoangiogenesis13. 
Similar indications of neovascularization were shown 
in pigs with chronic myocardial ischaemia and in a 
rat model of hindlimb ischaemia, both of which were 
treated with extracorporeal shockwave therapy14,15. 
In healthy rabbits, application of shockwave ther-
apy induced neoangiogenesis at the tendon–bone 
junction16,17.
The mechanisms of this observed neoangiogenesis are 
thought to include upregulation of growth factors, such 
as vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF); VEGF 
protein and mRNA expression were upregulated in 
shockwave-treated ischaemic pig heart, rat hindlimb, and 
in a rat osteotomy model14,15,17. Supportive of these data, 
in vitro treatment of human umbilical vein endo 
thelial 
cells (HUVECs) was also shown to upregulate mRNA 
expression of VEGF and its receptor FLT1 (REF. 14).
Recruitment of progenitor cells. Another putative 
mechanism by which shockwaves might induce neo-
angiogenesis is by recruitment of stem cells and pro-
genitor cells, which might have a role in new blood 
vessel formation. In the rat hindlimb, shockwave pre-
conditioning induced an upregulation of stromal cell- 
derived factor 1 (SDF-1)15. SDF-1 is a specific ligand 
for CXCR-4, which is strongly expressed on endo 
thelial 
progenitor cells (EPCs) and in haematopoietic stem cells, 
and has a crucial role in cell homing and function18. 
Outgrowth endothelial cells are an EPC subtype com-
mitted to endothelial cell formation and are involved 
in neo 
vascularization19. In the rat ischaemic hindlimb 
model, combining shockwave therapy with perfusion of 
exogenous EPCs showed additive effects in increasing 
perfusion, indicating that shockwaves enhance neo-
vascularization both by upregulation of angio 
genetic 
factors and by attraction of cells important in the 
 
formation of new blood vessels15.
Modulation of vasodilation. Shockwave therapy has 
been shown to induce immediate vasodilatation20, 
which gives rise to the hypothesis that shockwave treat-
ment could modulate the production of NO or other 
vaso 
dilators. These effects could be enzymatic or non-
enzymatic in nature. Evidence of a nonenzymatic path-
way of NO production has been shown by application of 
high-energy shockwaves to an l-arginine and hydrogen 
peroxide mixture, which resulted in synthesis of NO21. 
Conversely, shockwaves applied at energy densities com-
patible with clinical use are able to enhance endothelial 
nitric oxide synthase (eNOS) enzymatic activity via the 
PI3K–Akt pathway and can, therefore, stimulate NO pro-
duction in HUVECs22. Furthermore, shockwave therapy 
has also been shown to stimulate neuronal nitric oxide 
synthase (nNOS) enzymatic activity and NO production 
in neuronal cells in a dose-dependent fashion23.
Key points
• Low-intensity extracorporeal shockwave therapy (Li-ESWT) has emerged and rapidly 
gained popularity as a treatment option for men with erectile dysfunction (ED)
• The mechanisms by which this therapy enhances erectile function are unclear,  
but hypotheses include stimulation of neoangiogenesis, recruitment of stem cells and 
Schwann cell activation leading to nerve regeneration
• Single-arm trials almost unanimously show beneficial effects in patients with 
vasculogenic ED, even in those who do not respond to phosphodiesterase-5 inhibitors
• Randomized controlled trials (RCTs) have produced conflicting results, and have 
evaluated erectile function only a short time after treatment; several RCTs are  
highly biased
• Meta-analyses and systematic reviews conclude that shockwave therapy has an 
effect, but these analyses are limited by the fact that biased RCTs have been included 
in these analyses, and some fail to recognize this limitation
• Thus, no high-quality level 1a evidence is available and level 1b evidence is conflicting 
regarding the use of Li-ESWT for ED treatment

Nerve regeneration. Very few studies have investigated 
the effects of shockwave therapy on nerve regenera-
tion. Hausner et al.24 showed that shockwave therapy 
improved functional recovery in Sprague–Dawley rats 
receiving a homotopic nerve autograft into the right sci-
atic nerve, compared with controls that received auto-
grafts without shockwave therapy. Electron microscopic 
analysis revealed that debris clearance was faster and 
scarring reduced in the regenerating nerves of shock-
wave-treated animals compared with controls, which 
led the authors to propose that shockwaves ameliorate 
Wallerian degeneration and improve removal of degen-
erated axons, increasing the regenerative capacity of 
the injured axons24. Following peripheral nerve injury, 
Schwann cells alter their phenotype from myelinated to 
multiplying and activated, and they form the bands of 
Büngner, which act as a guide for developing axons25. 
Schuh et al.25 investigated the effects of ex vivo shock-
wave treatment of nerves on subsequent Schwann cell 
cultures from these nerves and found consistently higher 
purity, proliferation rate, and expression of regenera-
tive phenotype-associated markers (p75 neurotrophic 
factor receptor, glial fibrillary acidic protein, c-Jun) in 
pretreated Schwann cell cultures. Hence, these stud-
ies suggest an effect of shockwave therapy on nerve 
regeneration, which could be established by supporting 
Schwann cell proliferation.
Putative mechanisms in animal models of ED
To date, four studies by three research groups have indi-
cated beneficial effects of shockwave therapy on erectile 
function in rats with diabetes. The incidence of ED in 
men with diabetes is threefold that of the general popu-
lation and erectile difficulties manifest at a younger age. 
Endothelial dysfunction represents a unifying alteration 
in the pathogenesis of cardiovascular diseases, diabetes 
and ED26, hence, diabetic animal models displaying ED 
provide a robust means of evaluating novel treatment 
strategies, particularly those with putative effects on the 
level of endothelial function and structure6. Qiu and 
co-workers27 used streptozotocin (STZ) injections to 
induce type 1 diabetes mellitus in rats and applied 300 
shocks to the penis at 0.1 mJ/mm2 and a frequency of 120 
per minute for six sessions, resulting in a partial recovery 
of the erectile responses of STZ rats to cavernous nerve 
stimulation. Liu et al.28 used a similar rat model and 
administered a total of 100, 200, or 300 shocks at 120 per 
minute for six sessions, with a similar resultant improve-
ment in the highest-dose group and a dose-dependent 
increase in efficacy of shockwave therapy. Equivalence 
of low-intensity pulsed ultra 
sonography (LIPUS) 
and low-energy shockwave treatment were shown in 
 
the same rat model by Lei and co-workers29. Using the 
Goto-Kakizaki (GK) rat, a genetic model for type 2 dia-
betes, Assaly-Kaddoum6 and colleagues showed that 
Li-ESWT significantly improved erectile function to the 
 
same extent as sildenafil, and treatment effects were 
potentiated when combined with sildenafil.
Neoangiogenesis. As in other disease models, the 
observed functional improvement in ED in the dia-
betic rat is associated with enhanced expression of 
endo 
thelial markers, such as eNOS and rat endothelial 
antigen 1 (RECA-1), as well as elevated VEGF levels27–29. 
These data suggest increased endothelial cell turnover 
in the corpus cavernosum. As endothelial proliferation 
is a key event in the formation of new blood vessels, this 
observation suggests an increase in neo 
angiogenesis, 
although quantification of small vessels has not been 
carried out.
Recruitment of progenitor cells. In a study by Qiu and 
colleagues27, newborn pups were injected with the thy-
midine analogue 5-ethynyl-2ʹ-deoxyuridine (EdU), 
which is incorporated in the DNA of actively prolif-
erating cells. These label-retaining cells (LRCs) are 
believed to represent stem cells due to their ability to 
stay quiescent after a brief period of cellular division, 
which enables them to retain a higher level of EdU30. 
The concept derives from the observation that stem 
cells divide only rarely to preserve their proliferative 
potential and reduce DNA errors that occur during 
chromosome duplication31. Type 1 diabetes was then 
induced by STZ injection and shockwave therapy was 
applied to the penis afterwards. The team observed 
that the number of LRC was about ninefold (P <0.05) 
higher in the shockwave-treated  group of rats than 
in the untreated group, which the authors interpreted 
as stem cells being recruited to the penis after treat-
ment27. This finding was reproduced in a subsequent 
study by Li et al.32,who also illustrated that shockwave 
therapy induced the expression of SDF-1 in the corpus 
cavernosum in a dose-dependent manner, suggesting 
that SDF-1 might act as a recruitment factor for these 
EDU+ cells. The authors interpreted the higher num-
ber of LRCs observed in the corpus cavernosum as an 
 
indication of mesenchymal stem cell recruitment. 
Figure 1 | Schematic depiction of a shockwave as used in the treatment of erectile 
dysfunction. A shockwave is a longitudinal acoustic wave consisting of a short pulse of 
about 5 μs duration that is characterized by a near instantaneous jump to a peak positive 
acoustic pressure, which is referred to as a ‘shock’, followed by a longer-lasting period of 
negative pressure. The amplitude of the negative pressure is always much less than that 
of the peak positive pressure, and no abrupt transition is observed in the negative  
phase of the waveform. Depending on the energy flux density used and the source of  
the shockwave, variations are seen in the shape and amplitude of the shockwave.

However, the relevance of this observation has been 
debated, as in newborn pups, EdU is not only incorpo-
rated in stem cells but might also be retained in other 
cell types with a slow rate of proliferation throughout 
their lifespan. Furthermore, the ideal time for stem cell 
labelling with nucleotide analogues — early neonatal, 
late neonatal, and adult — has never been determined 
in this context33. Thus, the influx of LRCs might indicate 
influx of other cells types as well as stem cells and, in the 
context of ED, specific recruitment of stem cells needs 
to be confirmed, for example by co-staining of the EdU-
stained cells with antibodies against stem cell markers 
such as CD105, CD73 and CD90, and possibly Stro-1 
in the corpus cavernosum34,35.
Modulation of vasodilation. An ex vivo study, in 
which endothelium-dependent and endothelium- 
independent relaxation of cavernous tissues of 
shockwave-treated GK rats was tested in an organ 
bath setting, concluded that shockwave treatment 
did not improve altered nitrergic relaxations in GK 
rats versus Wistar rats serving as their healthy con-
trols6. The absence of an effect of shockwave therapy 
on in vitro nitrinergic relaxation results suggests that 
the pro-erectile effect of Li-ESWT might be mediated 
by a mechanism independent of NO and/or its down-
stream second messenger cGMP. This conclusion was 
further supported by treating the tissues with silde-
nafil, which recruits the NO and/or cGMP pathway, 
as an additive effect was observed when combined 
with Li-ESWT6. Hence, direct vasodilatatory effects 
of shockwave therapy have not yet been confirmed in 
animal models of ED.
Nerve regeneration. Shockwave treatment of the penis 
in an unvalidated rat model of pelvic neurovascular 
injury (combined cavernous nerve crush and internal 
pudendal neurovascular bundle ligation) induced a 
dose-dependent increase in intracorporeal nNOS lev-
els and p75 neurotrophin receptor, as well as increased 
levels of S100, a marker for mature Schwann cells in the 
dorsal penile nerve32. According to the study authors, 
the findings suggested increased nerve regeneration 
as a result of shockwave application, as Schwann cells 
are key players in this process. Corresponding in vitro 
studies showed that Li-ESWT treatment of Schwann 
cells induced Schwann cell proliferation32. Thus, 
Li-ESWT might stimulate neuroregeneration by cre-
ating and maintaining an environment amenable to 
nerve regrowth.
Figure 2 | Putative mechanisms of action of shockwave therapy for ED. Shockwaves form microbubbles (A) in the 
vasculature and tissue that collapse (B) and cause disruption of the endothelium (C). Endothelial disruption might  
activate resident stem cells (D) and result in chemokine production with attraction of (endothelial) progenitor cells (E)  
and release of VEGF (F); these factors combine to initiate neoangiogenesis (G). In addition, microbubble collapse induces 
shear stress and might simulate endothelial NO production (H). Furthermore, shockwave therapy might also enhance  
Schwann- 
cell-mediated nitrergic-nerve repair after injury (I).

 Energy flux density
(EFD). The energy delivered by 
the shockwave-generating 
source at the focussed point is 
called energy flux density and 
is normally recorded in energy 
per surface area units (mJ/
mm2).
Animal models in summary. Studies in animal and disease 
models suggest that shockwave therapy is able to stimulate 
neoangiogenesis, recruit regenerative cells, enhance nerve 
regeneration via stimulation of Schwann cell proliferation, 
and might exert direct vasodilatatory effects, potentially 
as a result of enhanced shear stress caused by shockwave 
application20. Only a very limited number of studies have 
investigated these effects in rodent models of diabetic and 
nerve-injury-induced ED, and suggest altered expression 
of endothelial markers and potential influx of regenerative 
cells, whereas direct modulation of vasodilatation has not 
been confirmed. In nerve injury models, effects on neuro-
regeneration might be achieved via Schwann cell activa-
tion, although this effect has only been observed in vitro. 
These studies provide preliminary insights, but no defin-
itive answers, and many questions remain regarding the 
effects of shockwave therapy outside of the diabetic and 
neurogenic ED setting.
Clinical data in vascular ED
Focussed Li‑ESWT
Based on the fact that a reduction in cavernosal ar 
terial 
blood flow is one of the hallmarks of ED, Vardi and col-
leagues4 hypothesized that effects on neovascularization 
induced by low-intensity shockwaves in other organ 
systems might also hold potential for the treatment of 
ED, by improving arterial blood supply to the erectile 
tissue in the corpora cavernosa. In 2010, they initiated 
the first single-arm trial to provide a proof of principle 
and designed a treatment protocol based on the method-
ology used in cardiac Li-ESWT and adapted the depth 
of penetration to fit the cavernosal target tissue4,5. As the 
study used a focussed Li-ESWT device (Omnispec 1000, 
Medispec), the study protocol included five different tar-
get sites in the penis in order to cover the whole corpora 
cavernosa: three along the penile shaft and two at the 
crural level. Using the protocol suggested by Vardi and 
co-workers, four single-arm trials and five randomized 
controlled trials (RCTs) have since been conducted, 
using focussed-shockwave machines with electro-
magnetic or electrohydraulic generated shockwaves 
(TABLE 1). The treatment protocol for studies using the 
Omnispec 1000 has been consistent, based on 2 sessions 
per week consisting of 1,500 shocks with an energy flux 
density (EFD) of 0.09 mJ/mm2 for two periods of 3 weeks, 
intercalated with a 3 week treatment pause. Conversely, 
studies using the Duolith device (Storz Medical AG) 
have involved 5–12 weekly sessions of 3,000 shocks each 
at an EFD of 0.15–0.25 mJ/mm2 (REF. 4).
Outcomes of shockwave therapy for ED have been 
measured using the validated erectile hardness score 
(EHS; a score of 3–4 indicates that penetration is possi-
ble)36, and the validated International Index of Erectile 
Function (IIEF)-537 questionnaire and the IIEF erec-
tile function (IIEF-EF)38 domain score. After shock-
wave treatment, the percentage of patients achieving 
an EHS >3 ranged from 54% in patients who did not 
respond to treatment with PDE5I to almost 78% in 
patients with mild-to-moderate vascular ED, whereas 
IIEF improvements were in the range of +1.5 (IIEF-5) 
in PDE5I-nonresponders to +10 (IIEF-EF) in patients 
with vascular ED who also used PDE5I4,7,8,39–51 (TABLE 1). 
Notably, three of the five RCTs of focussed-shockwave 
devices that used these questionnaires met their pri-
mary outcome measure8,39,45, although one had a high 
risk of bias45, and the results of two other RCTs were 
negative for the primary outcome40,50. It should be noted 
however, that in one of these two trials, the depth of 
penetration was set at skin level according to the man-
ufacturer’s instructions50. In one of the negative studies, 
the treatment protocol was identical to the one originally 
described by Vardi and colleagues4, indicating that the 
results of the latter group might not be reproducible40,41. 
A limitation of all these trials is that the follow-up period 
was short — a maximum of 6 months, with the exception 
of the one RCT with a high risk of bias, which followed 
up patients for 12 months45. Differences in patient selec-
tion and allowance of concomitant PDE5I use might 
explain these differences, although user- 
dependency 
(the shockwave device is hand-held enabling interuser 
variability in application) and differences in trial design 
and execution cannot be ruled out. To illustrate the latter, 
some trials used a cap on the probe to prevent shock-
waves from reaching the tissue as the sham treatment, 
whereas others switched off the device and provided a 
ticking sound via loudspeakers.
Linear Li‑ESWT
Focussed shockwaves provide energy to a very small area 
at which the probe is aimed. The need to treat different 
areas of the corpus cavernosum separately might, there-
fore, limit the treatment effect. Linear distribution of 
shockwaves might be able to overcome this limitation by 
providing superior organ coverage of the corpora cavernosa 
 
(FIG. 3)42. Based on this assumption, treatment proto-
cols using linear shockwaves have reduced the number 
of sessions to, typically, four once-weekly sessions of 
3,600–5,000 shocks (generated by a piezomagnetic or 
piezoelectric source), although one study mentions ten 
weekly sessions with only 600 shocks given per session50. 
Results of four single-arm trials show improvements in 
IIEF-EF scores reaching +7.5 in patients with vasculo-
genic ED and a somewhat surprising improvement of +9 
points in PDE5I nonresponders. Two RCTs have been 
performed, of which one carried a low risk of bias as it 
was well designed and executed and adequately powered, 
which did not show improvement in either IIEF-5 score 
or in EHS 3–4 rate50. Of note, this study was the one 
trial that used a 10 × 600 shocks schedule. Furthermore, 
one potential criticism is that a gel pad was used that 
delivers shockwaves at the skin level. According to 
the authors, these have a penetration depth of at least 
0.5–1 cm, so the use of this pad might or might not be 
sufficient for the shockwaves to reach the centre of the 
corpora and crura50. The other trial was a multicentre 
RCT, but this study was poorly conducted, with severe 
limitations in methodology: the placebo treatment was 
performed with the device off and a shockwave sound 
through speakers, and minimal clinical important dif-
ferences (MCID) that were developed for the six-item 
IIEF-EF were applied to the five-item IIEF-5 score for 
which MCIDs have never been validated, potentially

 b  Linear shockwave device
a  Focussed shockwave device
influencing the number of responders to see an improve-
ment. In addition, no statistical analysis was performed, 
but the study did show an unparalleled response rate of 
81.3%51. These limitations undoubtedly severely affect 
the clinical validity of this RCT, nonetheless it has been 
included in meta-analyses, vide infra.
Factors affecting the success of Li‑ESWT
Several factors have been hypothesized to influence 
the final treatment outcome after shockwave therapy 
for ED. In a meta-analysis52, patients with mild ED at 
baseline were shown to benefit most from Li-ESWT, 
whereas in an RCT performed by Yee and colleagues41, 
the only patients to benefit were those with severe ED 
at baseline. Overall review of the available data suggests 
that PDE5I nonresponders have lower response rates 
than those observed in the treatment-naive or PDE5I 
responders, which might be associated with the fact that 
they more often have moderate or severe ED (TABLE 1). 
Reisman and co-workers’ multicentre single-arm trial 
additionally studied the duration of ED and showed 
that men who had experienced ED for 10–13 years had 
lower quantitative responses (IIEF-EF) than those with 
shorter disease duration, and that duration of ED over-
all was negatively correlated with treatment success42. 
A study of 56 men treated with Li-ESWT showed that 
age (OR 0.85, 95% CI 0.76–0.95), and the presence of 
≥3 comorbidities (OR 0.02, 95% CI 0.00– 0.98) were 
predictive factors for achieving an EHS of 3–4 at 
1 month after completion of the treatment49. Whether 
any differences exist in treatment outcomes between 
various devices and treatment protocols is unknown, 
owing to a lack of direct comparison studies. Dose-
finding studies — in terms of number of shocks, EFD, 
or number of sessions — have, surprisingly, never been 
conducted for any device, so the optimal protocols and 
dosages for shockwave therapy are currently unknown. 
Meta-analyses have attempted to address this issue 
 
and found that lower EFD, increased number of 
pulses and shorter treatment courses (<6 weeks) are 
 
associated with improved treatment outcomes52–55. 
However, the use of different devices with distinct 
mechanisms of shockwave generation precludes direct 
comparison of the outcomes of various energy settings 
or protocols. Hence, well-designed RCTs with standard 
treatment protocols and long-term follow-up periods 
are required in order to demonstrate the actual efficacy 
of Li-ESWT for the treatment of ED56.
Postprostatectomy ED
As the cavernous nerves run in close proximity to the 
prostate gland, radical prostatectomy can be associated 
with nerve damage and permanent ED. Even if the sur-
gery results in minimal direct nerve damage, heating, 
stretching, and local inflammation can cause a tempo-
rary loss of neural function, resulting in a reduction 
in erogenic, spontaneous, and nightly erections57,58. As 
erection itself is a prerequisite for sufficient penile blood 
supply and oxygenation, the resulting reduction in reg-
ular penile oxygen supply is thought to lead to smooth 
muscle apoptosis and, finally, fibrosis in the erectile 
tissue within the corpora cavernosa58,59. This process 
adds a venogenic component to the mechanism of post-
prostatectomy ED, making it especially difficult to treat 
using noninvasive methods60,61.
Despite this unmet need, only two open-label, sin-
gle-arm studies have explored Li-ESWT as a treatment 
option for postprostatectomy ED. Both used the electro-
magnetic Duolith SD1 for 6 weeks. The first included 30 
men with mild-to-moderate or mild ED of mixed aetiol-
ogies43. Three of these men had undergone radical pros-
tatectomy, but no further details were provided. Overall, 
the authors reported positive effects, but the specific 
results from the postprostatectomy group were not 
clear. The only detail mentioned was a greater improve-
ment in erectile function in men with vasculogenic ED 
compared with those who had undergone radical pros-
tatectomy. Thus, the study provides insufficient data to 
Figure 3 | Focussed and linear shockwave therapy. Focussed devices deliver the generated shockwaves to a focussed 
area at a predetermined tissue depth. Thus, the probe must be moved during the course of a treatment session in order to 
cover the complete corpora cavernosa including the crura. Linear shockwave devices deliver the generated shockwaves 
over a larger, linear shaped area at a predefined depth of penetration. Thus, a larger area of corporal tissue is treated 
simultaneously, limiting the need to move the probe over the penis and crura.

 support the use of Li-ESWT in the post 
prostatectomy 
setting. The second study included 16 men who had 
undergone bilateral nerve-sparing robot-assisted rad-
ical prostatectomy a minimum of 12 months earlier47. 
The median preoperative IIEF-5 score was 25 (22–25), 
but at the time of the study (that is, after their surgery), 
the patients’ median IIEF-5 score was reduced to 9.5 
(range 5–20). IIEF scores taken 1 month after the last 
Li-ESWT session showed that 7 of 16 patients (43.8%) 
had a clinically meaningful improvement in erectile 
function, defined as an improvement of ≥1 ED cate-
gory (BOX 1); this improvement was maintained in four 
of these patients after 1 year. However, the median 
improvement in IIEF-5 scores was just +3.5 (-1–8) at 
1 month and dropped to +1 (-3–14) at 1 year. In addi-
tion, the study was confounded by the fact that 12 of 16 
participants (75%) used other erectogenic aids during 
the study, and by the fact that spontaneous improve-
ments in erectile function have been reported up to 
36 months after surgery in men who originally reported 
post 
prostatectomy ED62. Thus, discerning which of 
these effects represented an endogenous improvement 
and which is a potential Li-ESWT treatment effect is 
nearly impossible and, indeed, the study authors com-
mented that high-quality studies, in particular RCTs, 
are needed. At the time of writing, no such studies have 
been conducted and none are ongoing, so conclusions 
regarding the effect of Li-ESWT on erectile function 
following radical prostatectomy cannot be drawn.
Peyronie’s‑related ED
Since Bellorofonte et al.63 first described ESWT as a 
potential treatment for Peyronie’s disease in 1989, it 
has been widely used for this indication. Many early 
studies reported positive results on pain reduction, 
but reductions in penile deviation or improvements in 
erectile function have been infrequently observed64–68. 
Importantly, most studies were not randomized and the 
protocols were not standardized, making interpretation 
and recommendations difficult. To date, only three 
sham-controlled trials have been published and these 
show minimal, if any, benefit of ESWT on ED associated 
with Peyronie’s disease69–71, and no effect on penile 
curvature, although pain seemed to resolve faster in 
patients treated with ESWT than during the natural 
disease course of Peyronie’s disease. Visual Analogue 
Scale (VAS, on a 10-point scale) scores dropped by 1.05–
4.73 in patients treated with ESWT versus 0.8–2.89 in 
sham-treated patients. In two of the three studies, this 
drop in pain reporting was statistically significant69,70, 
whereas it did not reach significance in the other71. 
However, whether pain should be treated with ESWT 
is questionable, because 89% of patients with Peyronie’s 
disease will be pain-free after a mean of 18 months, 
even without any treatment72. In addition, ESWT 
requires multiple visits to treatment facilities, which are 
associated with costs to the patient and the health-care 
system. In this context, treating pain with on-demand 
oral pain medications is probably more reasonable73,74.
Early studies of ESWT in patients with Peyronie’s dis-
ease focussed mainly on reduction of penile deviation 
and improvement of penile pain, with little emphasis on 
ED64,70,75. Thus, these studies cannot be compared with 
subsequent trials, which have only investigated the effect 
of Li-ESWT in patients with ED, and not those who also 
had Peyronie’s disease. Even if the use of ESWT to treat 
Peyronie’s disease seems similar to the use of Li-ESWT 
for the treatment of ED, some fundamental differences 
must be considered. One important aspect is the EFD, 
which is set at 0.09 mJ/mm2 in the majority of studies of 
Li-ESWT for the treatment of ED (TABLE 1). This dose is 
much lower than the usual EFD implemented the trials 
focusing on Peyronie’s disease, as these mostly use doses 
>0.15 mJ/mm2 (REFS 64,70). Thus, many studies inves-
tigating the effects of shockwaves in Peyronie’s disease 
have not strictly applied Li-ESWT, but have actually used 
medium-intensity or high-intensity shockwaves. Another 
consideration is that trials of ESWT for Peyronie’s disease 
applied the shockwaves on the Peyronie’s plaques of the 
tunica albuginea, without involving the underlying erec-
tile tissue within the cavernous bodies64,70,75. This protocol 
is in contrast to Li-ESWT for ED treatment, in which the 
shockwaves are applied at different sites along the penile 
shaft and the primary target is the erectile tissue, not 
the tunica albuginea70,71,75,76. One nonrandomized study 
investi 
gating ESWT in patients with Peyronie’s disease 
included patients with Peyronie’s disease with or without 
associated ED64. The EFD of 0.07–0.17 mJ/mm2 is in the 
 
mid-range between the doses of ESWT used for 
Peyronie’s disease and the EFD used in Li-ESWT to 
treat ED. No statistically significant improvement in ED 
Box 1 | Patient‑reported outcomes in erectile dysfunction studies
The international index of erectile function (IIEF), developed by Rosen et al.38 in 1997,  
is often used in two abridged forms for evaluating outcomes in studies investigating 
treatment for ED.
IIEF‑5
• An abridged version of the IIEF consisting of five questions37
• The possible scores for the IIEF-5 range from 5 to 25, and ED is classified into five 
categories based on the scores
• Severe ED (5–7), moderate ED (8–11), mild-to-moderate ED (12–16), mild ED (17–21), 
and no ED (22–25)
Erectile function domain score of the IIEF (IIEF‑EF)
• Consists of six questions
• Possible scores range from 6 to 30
• Classified as severe ED (EF scores 6–10), moderate ED (11–16), mild-to-moderate ED 
(17–21), mild ED (22–25) and no ED (26–30)85
• Minimal clinically important differences (MCID) have been defined as the minimal 
amount of change needed in the EF domain to be clinically meaningful to patients
• MCID were defined according to baseline ED severity — mild: 2; moderate: 5; severe: 
7 — by Rosen et al.77 
• If no specific severity category is considered, the MCID for the IIEF-EF is 4 (REFS 78,79)
Erection hardness score (EHS)
• A single-item assessment of rigidity developed in the clinical trials programme for the 
marketing of sildenafil, which was validated by Mulhall and colleagues36 in 2007
• Classified in five categories: penis does not enlarge (0); penis is larger, but not hard (1); 
penis is hard, but not hard enough for penetration (2); penis is hard enough for 
penetration, but not completely hard (3); penis is completely hard and fully rigid (4)
• In most studies investigating the effects of shockwave therapy on ED, achieving an 
EHS of 3–4 is defined as successful treatment

 (assessed by the IIEF-5 score) was observed in this study: 
the mean IIEF-5 score went from 11 at baseline to 12 at 
the end of the study in treated patients and from 10 to 12 
in untreated patients. Even in the subgroup of patients 
who had Peyronie’s disease and concomitant ED (n = 18; 
34% of the study cohort), a substantial improvement in 
erectile function was noted in only five patients (28%). At 
the end of treatment, 60% of the patients in ESWT group 
reported that the results were not what they desired and 
requested another type of treatment. This early study is 
limited by its retrospective nature and the lack of a real 
placebo group (the authors used a nontreated cohort of 
15 matched patients as controls), but it indicates that 
ESWT does not improve erectile function in the majority 
of patients with Peyronie’s disease and ED.
Only one randomized study has investigated the use 
 
of ESWT in patients with ED and simultaneous 
 
Peyronie’s disease75. In this study, 100 patients with 
ED and Peyronie’s disease were randomized to receive 
either ESWT alone or in combination with tadalafil 
5 mg daily. The authors applied 2,000 shockwaves each 
session, which was conducted once weekly for 4 con-
secutive weeks with EFD set at 0.25 mJ/mm2 to multiple 
target points on the penis. After a 24-week follow- 
 
up period, the IIEF-5 score significantly improved 
in both groups, with the effect being stronger in the 
combination group: Li-ESWT: + 6.2 points, Li-ESWT 
combined with tadalafil: 9.92 points (P > 0.05). The 
authors concluded that combining ESWT and tada-
lafil 5 mg daily might present a valid conservative 
treatment strategy in patients who suffer from both 
ED and Peyronie’s disease. However, this study was 
limited by the absence of a placebo group, and the 
short follow-up duration. Overall, no convincing evi-
dence is available to show that Li-ESWT has a place in 
 
the treatment of men with concomitant Peyronie’s dis-
ease and ED, and trials using energy settings at low 
intensity are yet to be conducted.
Quality of evidence
The literature uniformly finds that Li-ESWT is safe and 
single-arm studies investigating the efficacy of Li-ESWT 
in ED have been encouraging. However, although some 
studies include objective parameters such as penile 
duplex ultrasonography or nocturnal penile tumes-
cence measurements4, the main outcome measure is 
always a subjective patient-reported outcome expressed 
through validated questionnaires (BOX 1). The use of 
patient- 
reported outcomes means that the potential 
for placebo responses is high, so randomized trials are 
needed to truly evaluate the effects of Li-ESWT in ED. 
Seven such trials have been published to date (TABLE 1). 
All these trials were conducted in men with vascular 
pathology as the most likely aetiology of ED. One of the 
randomized trials, conducted by Srini and colleagues45, 
should be interpreted with caution owing to an unusu-
ally high drop-out rate of 58% in the placebo group and 
42% in the active treatment group45. The authors do not 
provide any reason for this high drop-out rate. A drop-
out rate >20% is generally considered to seriously limit 
study validity77. Another trial, by Motil and colleagues51, 
is also to be interpreted with caution owing to a lack 
of statistical analysis and a poor description of method-
ology, resulting in a high risk of bias. Of the remain-
ing five studies, two, both by the same group, reported 
that Li-ESWT was efficacious in the treatment of ED8,39, 
whereas the other two did not show a benefit over sham 
treatment41,50. The last study, carried out by Olsen and 
co-workers, showed that Li-ESWT improved the EHS 
but not the IIEF-5 score40. No clear explanation for this 
inconsistency was offered, but one can speculate that 
EHS is a more robust tool, whereas the IIEF-5 is able 
to detect more subtle differences. However, it is impor-
tant to note that IIEF-5 was stated as the main outcome 
measure of the study and that the EHS is not validated 
in the relevant language, which was considered a limita-
tion by the authors, and should indeed be regarded as a 
possible source of bias.
In 2016–2017, four systematic reviews of Li-ESWT 
for ED have been published52–55 (TABLE 2). The first, by 
Fojecki and colleagues53 evaluated Li-ESWT in uro 
logical 
dis 
orders including pelvic pain and Peyronie’s disease 
and did not include a meta-analysis. In this study, effects 
on IIEF scores were inconsistent, whereas EHS data 
implied that the treatment might be beneficial in PDE5I 
responders. Again, this outcome might indicate that EHS 
is a robust tool aimed at the evaluation of penile rigidity 
only and IIEF might detect more subtle differences, for 
example, changes in intercourse satisfaction. The authors 
of this systematic review did not discuss the risk of bias in 
the individual studies included, and the conclusion failed 
to take into consideration the limitations of the studies by 
Srini33 and Olsen30, which are the studies to have reported 
the largest positive effects on the EHS.
The second systematic review, by Lu et al.52 did 
include a meta-analysis of Li-ESWT in ED, and their 
main conclusion was that Li-ESWT improved IIEF by 
an average of 2.00 points compared with sham treat-
ment. Importantly, this improvement is below the min-
imal clinically important difference, which is accepted 
as 4 points over all categories of the IIEF-EF78,79 (BOX 1). 
Subgroup analyses implied that statistically signif-
icant effects were only seen in men with mild ED. 
Furthermore, several methodological flaws limit the 
analyses of the Lu et al.52 paper. Firstly, the authors 
neglected to exclude studies at high risk of bias even 
though this parameter had been previously noted. 
Secondly, studies that included ED as a second 
ary out-
come were included on equal terms in the analysis as 
those that evaluated ED as the primary outcome, and 
the authors even included a non 
randomized trial that 
used control data from 15 previous patients64. Thirdly, 
the authors report the meta-analysis results in terms of 
IIEF score, while the original studies included report 
on either IIEF-5 or IIEF-EF scores, which cannot be 
used interchangeably, and they used crude pretreat-
ment and post-treatment scores rather than ana-
lysing the change in validated erectile function scores. 
Finally, the results of some of the cited studies have 
been erroneously quoted80.
The third systematic review, by Angulo and col-
leagues54 also contained a meta-analysis, but was limited

 to truly randomized trials focussing on ED as the pri-
mary end point. In this study, the authors reported 
that Li-ESWT improved IIEF-EF by an average of 2.54 
points compared with sham treatment at 1 month, but 
that the data were insufficient to evaluate long-term 
results. As in the meta-analysis conducted by Lu and 
colleagues52, this change is below the threshold to be 
considered a clinically important difference and again, 
the authors have neglected to account for potential 
biases within individual studies52.
The most recent systematic review and meta-analysis 
was published in 2017 by Clavijo et al.55 In this report, 
the data are very encouraging, showing an overall 
improvement of 4.17 points on the IIEF-EF scale com-
pared with placebo. Furthermore, the authors have 
included an assessment of biases in the supplementary 
material. However, the study by Srini et al.45 is included 
even though it is considered to be at high risk of bias 
owing to the high drop-out rate and unequal groups 
at baseline. Furthermore, this latest systematic review 
includes three conference abstracts81–83 in which the 
potential risk of bias is unclear, as detailed information 
is lacking and the data have not been thoroughly peer 
reviewed55. These limitations might be the reason 
why the outcome is so much higher than in previous 
meta-analyses. To date, only one of these studies has 
been published in its entirety50. When considering the 
combined results of the meta-analysis, readers must 
keep in mind that the Srini study45 and the two unpub-
lished studies81,82 all contributed data showing positive 
effects of Li-ESWT55. A further consideration, which 
applies to all three meta-analyses, is that the study by 
Olsen and co-workers40, which failed to show an IIEF-5 
improvement compared with placebo, was excluded. 
This omission is likely due to the fact that Olsen and 
colleagues did not report raw IIEF data, only the per-
centage of patients that demonstrated an improvement 
≥5 points. Thus, although this study was negative in 
terms of IIEF data, only the EHS data — which were 
statistically significant — are included. This discrepancy 
is a source of potential bias in all three meta-analyses, as 
positive studies were included but negative studies were 
excluded, and Olsen and co-workers were not contacted 
for provision of the raw data.

 Overall, these limitations mean that the three cur-
rently available meta-analyses cannot be considered 
to provide level 1 evidence for a clinically meaningful 
effect of Li-ESWT for ED, and that they should not form 
the basis of clinical decision-making. Adding to the 
uncertainty surrounding the use of Li-ESWT is that all 
 
the meta-analyses pooled data from studies using dif-
ferent machines, different treatment protocols, and 
different follow-up durations. To further complicate 
matters, five different devices are commercially avail-
able and these all have differences in both technical 
specifications and suggested treatment protocols. These 
inconsistencies mean that data from one device cannot 
simply be extrapolated to another, and randomized tri-
als have been conducted for only three of these devices, 
with conflicting results. Moreover, effects of Li-ESWT 
might differ in different subpopulations and the ideal 
patient for Li-ESWT still remains to be defined; studies 
designed to optimize the treatment protocol are lacking.
Future prospects and medical need
To date, all available options for ED treatment act only 
as symptomatic therapies aimed to relieve the lack of 
an erection sufficient to complete a satisfactory sex-
ual intercourse. Although PDE5I revolutionized the 
therapeutic management of men with ED, an unmet 
medical need remains for cure and restoration of 
natural erections. In difficult-to-treat populations, 
in which an underlying condition impairs the erec-
tile response (such as diabetes mellitus, endothelial 
dysfunction in the context of a metabolic syndrome, 
or postsurgical erectile impairment), converting 
PDE5I-nonresponders into responders would be a 
major advance.
With these goals in mind, as the only available 
therapeutic option to cure ED and restore natural 
erectile function, Li-ESWT has rapidly gained popu-
larity, even though the scientific evidence is not robust 
enough to recommend this approach for routine clin-
ical application. In an editorial, Hatzichristou84 ele-
gantly raised the point that opportunistic physicians 
might offer this novel therapy to patients with psycho-
genic ED or even to men without ED, in a preventive 
setting. Publicity in the British lay press, regarding 
a retired England cricketer who claimed that he had 
Li-ESWT treatment done to prevent future erectile 
difficulties, is indicative of this concern85. Such claims 
must be strongly condemned by the medical commu-
nity, rather than being used by doctors to achieve 
personal gain at the cost of patient care. Although 
Li-ESWT has been characterized by a low incidence 
of serious adverse effects, practices like these could be 
considered no less than quackery. Multiple companies 
are now promoting their devices based on evidence 
gained using different machines with different mech-
anisms of action, and claiming efficacy in the absence 
of robust RCTs. Both the scientific community and 
the companies promoting this technology must take 
responsibility to speed up and improve research in 
order to produce and publish robust evidence on 
Li-ESWT for ED.
The available systematic reviews suggest the presence 
of level 1 evidence; however, the quality of a systematic 
review is largely dependent on the quality of data acquisi-
tion, data uniformity, and the quality of studies included 
in these reviews. If researchers continue to include 
positive trials with a drop-out rate of 42–58%, the real 
efficacy of Li-ESWT for ED will never be revealed. 
Similarly, these trials include a multitude of studies 
with large differences in treatment protocols, devices 
employed, and follow-up durations and methods. The 
lack of high-quality evidence is perhaps best illustrated 
by the fact that the FDA has not approved any Li-ESWT 
device for clinical use in the USA. In light of the above 
discussion, the fundamental goal in this field should 
be the careful assessment of the real clinical benefits of 
Li-ESWT, as the scientific debate thus far has provided 
more questions than answers. The only way to overcome 
this limitation will be a large multicentre RCT for each 
device using a standard protocol, long (>12 months) fol-
low-up period, and including multiple subgroups of ED 
aetiology enabling preplanned subanalyses of the effi-
cacy in these designated groups56. Furthermore, many 
concerns remain to be addressed regarding the optimal 
therapeutic protocol, and whether a given protocol is 
feasible for any Li-ESWT device, or whether protocols 
should be device-specific. In addition, the long-term 
effects of Li-ESWT treatment are still not understood 
— in particular, any harmful effects of Li-ESWT, such 
as fibrosis, or development of Peyronie’s disease due to 
repeated microtrauma, must be assessed. Finally, we 
need to better understand the mechanics of the therapy 
itself, for example, the need for repeated treatment in 
order to maintain a sustained effect and whether one 
Li-ESWT device or technology (focussed versus linear, 
and mechanism of shockwave generation) is superior in 
terms of both cost and benefit. Additionally, the ideal 
patient profile for Li-ESWT, in terms of ED severity and 
aetiology, must also be determined. These questions do 
not necessarily have to be completely answered before 
we start routinely applying this treatment, but a min-
imum level of evidence will be needed to adequately 
counsel our patients.
Conclusions
Li-ESWT is the first treatment option for ED that has 
the potential to improve pharmacologically unassisted 
erectile function. The concept is unprecedented and 
revolutionary, and the effects at molecular and tissue 
level are largely unknown, although neoangiogenesis 
might have a key role. Following a series of single-arm 
trials, which almost unanimously show a benefit, several 
monocentric RCTs have now been published with mixed 
results. The results of these trials are compromized by 
uncertain or high risks of bias, and systematic reviews 
and meta-analyses based on these trials carry similar 
risks. Thus, no level 1 evidence is available to support 
the use of Li-ESWT in any population of patients with 
ED, and its use should, therefore, be limited to clinical 
trials until large multicentric RCTs have provided the 
necessary data to recommend the routine use of this 
promising novel technology as a first-line treatment.

 000 Low-intensity shockwave therapy for 
erectile dysfunction: is the evidence strong 
enough?
Mikkel Fode, Georgios Hatzichristodoulou, Ege Can 
Serefoglu, Paolo Verze and Maarten Albersen on 
behalf of the Young Academic Urologists Men’s Health 
Group
Low-intensity extracorporeal shockwave therapy 
(Li-ESWT) has gained popularity as a noninvasive 
treatment for erectile dysfunction (ED), with 
the potential to cure, rather than simply provide 
symptomatic relief. However, the quality of data 
regarding this treatment option is variable, and 
drawing conclusions is a challenge. In this Review, 
a team of expert authors describe the rationale and 
potential mechanisms of Li-ESWT for ED and discuss 
the available evidence for its clinical use.
