Abstract
Background: Guideline-concordant local therapy options for early breast cancer include lumpectomy plus whole breast irradi-
ation (LumpþWBI), lumpectomy plus brachytherapy, mastectomy alone, mastectomy plus reconstruction, and, in older
women, lumpectomy alone. We performed a comparative examination of each treatment’s complications and cost to assess
their relative values.
Methods: Using the MarketScan database of younger women with private insurance and the SEER-Medicare database of older
women with public insurance, we identified 105 211 women with early breast cancer diagnosed between 2000 and 2011. We
used diagnosis and procedural codes to identify treatment complications within 24 months of diagnosis and compared com-
plications by treatment using two-sided logistic regression. Mean total and complication-related cost, relative to LumpþWBI,
were calculated from a payer’s perspective and adjusted for differences in covariables using linear regression. All statistical
tests were two-sided.
Results: LumpþWBI was the most commonly used treatment. Mastectomy plus reconstruction was associated with nearly
twice the complication risk of LumpþWBI (Marketscan: 54.3% vs 29.6%, relative risk [RR] ¼ 1.87, 95% confidence interval [CI] ¼
1.82 to 1.91, P < .001; SEER-Medicare: 66.1% vs 37.6%, RR ¼ 1.75, 95% CI ¼ 1.69 to 1.82, P < .001) and was also associated with
higher adjusted total cost (Marketscan: $22 481 greater than LumpþWBI; SEER-Medicare: $1748 greater) and complication-
related cost (Marketscan: $9017 greater; SEER-Medicare: $2092 greater). Brachytherapy had modestly higher total cost and
complications than WBI. Lumpectomy alone entailed lower cost and complications in the SEER-Medicare cohort only.
Conclusions: Mastectomy plus reconstruction results in substantially higher complications and cost than other guideline-
concordant treatment options for early breast cancer. These findings are relevant to patients evaluating their local therapy
options and to value-based population health management.
Achieving value for patients, defined as the quality of outcomes
per dollar spent, has captured the attention of health care policy
makers as a way to improve care and reduce costs across whole
populations (1,2). The case for value-based care is especially
compelling in oncology, where both underuse of effective and
inexpensive therapies and overuse of costly but equally effec-
tive or marginally better interventions are prevalent (1,3).
Likewise, breast cancer is a cogent target within oncology as it

 now accounts for the highest number of new cancer cases in
the United States and requires substantial societal resources for
care of those diagnosed with the disease (4). Of the nearly 250
000 breast cancer patients diagnosed this year (4), over 60% will
present with localized, early-stage disease (5) for which the
National Comprehensive Cancer Network (NCCN) Guidelines
identify several evidence-based local management options in-
cluding mastectomy (Mast alone), mastectomy plus reconstruc-
tion (MastþRecon), lumpectomy plus whole breast irradiation
(LumpþWBI), and, in certain cases, lumpectomy plus brachy-
therapy (LumpþBrachy) or lumpectomy followed by endocrine
therapy alone without radiation (Lump alone) (6).
Evidence suggests that real-world decision-making among
these options is currently driven by patient and provider prefer-
ences, geography, and accessibility to certain treatments (7–10).
Incorporating the risk of complications, cost, and consider-
ations of value into the clinical decision may be a more rational
approach to ensuring affordable, effective care for this broad
and diverse patient population. Because the local treatment op-
tions above are associated with similar survival, their costs,
complications, and quality of life implications underpin the
value calculation (11,12). And yet, little research has sought to
quantify and compare the expense and toxicities of these thera-
pies in contemporary practice. To address this gap in knowl-
edge, we compared the costs and complications associated with
each local strategy using two complementary databases con-
sisting of younger women with private insurance (MarketScan)
and older women with public insurance (SEER-Medicare) diag-
nosed with breast cancer between 2000 and 2011.
Methods
Data Sources
The MarketScan Commercial Claims and Encounters database
(Truven Health Analytics, Ann Arbor, MI) is a convenience sam-
ple of individual-level medical and drug insurance claims for
patients under the age of 65 years. The claims are derived from
45 large employers and more than 100 health insurers that pro-
vide private insurance to employees, spouses, and dependents.
Healthcare is provided under a variety of fee-for-service, capi-
tated, and partially capitated health plans, including preferred
provider organizations and health maintenance organizations.
In 2002, the data set was expanded to include small- and me-
dium-sized firms.
The Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results (SEER)–
Medicare database captures clinical, pathological, and Medicare
claims data for incident cancers diagnosed in Medicare benefi-
ciaries who reside within one of 16 geographic areas accounting
for 26% of the US population. The case ascertainment rate is ap-
proximately 98%, and 93% of patients in SEER are successfully
linked to Medicare claims (13).
Study Subjects
A validated, claims-based algorithm was used to identify inci-
dent breast cancer cases in the MarketScan data from 2000 to
2011 (Supplementary Table 1, available online) (14). This algo-
rithm has a published sensitivity of 82% to 87% and a specificity
exceeding 99% for early-stage breast cancer (14,15). SEER data
were used to identify incident breast cancer cases in the SEER-
Medicare cohort during the same years. To enable determina-
tion of prediagnosis comorbidity and postdiagnosis treatments
and outcomes, the cohorts were limited to patients with com-
plete insurance coverage from 12 months prior through 24
months after diagnosis. In addition, as the intent was to assess
the value of treatments appropriate for early breast cancer, we
excluded patients treated with neoadjuvant chemotherapy or
postmastectomy radiation, both of which are generally used for
more advanced stage disease. Staging data are not available in
MarketScan claims, so diagnosis codes were used to exclude pa-
tients with distant metastasis (Supplementary Table 2, available
online). In contrast, staging data are present in the SEER-
Medicare cohort and were used to limit this cohort to patients
with early cancer, defined as stage T1-2 N0-1 M0 (16). The ana-
lytic cohorts were further limited to patients treated with either
LumpþWBI,
LumpþBrachy,
Lump
alone,
Mast
alone,
and
MastþRecon. This approach yielded 44 344 patients from the
MarketScan data (median age ¼ 53 years) and 60 867 patients
from the SEER-Medicare database (median age ¼ 75 years)
(Supplementary Table 1, available online).
Definitions of Study Variables
Breast surgery and radiation were classified using claims within
one year of diagnosis as in prior studies (Supplementary Table
2, available online) (17). The most extensive breast surgery
(lumpectomy vs mastectomy) within the first year after diagno-
sis was considered the definitive surgery. Oncologic breast sur-
geries
in
the
second
year
of
diagnosis
were
considered
secondary surgeries not part of the initial treatment course. The
LumpþWBI group was limited to those patients who received at
least 15 unique external beam radiation treatments without
concomitant brachytherapy. The LumpþBrachy group was lim-
ited to patients who received brachytherapy without concomi-
tant external beam radiation. The MastþRecon group included
patients with mastectomy within one year of diagnosis and a
code for breast reconstruction within two years of diagnosis (7).
Additional treatment variables derived from claims included
receipt of chemotherapy, trastuzumab, axillary surgery, and/or
contralateral mastectomy. For the SEER-Medicare cohort, tumor
characteristics
were
extracted
from
SEER
data.
For
the
MarketScan cohort, adjuvant endocrine therapy within one year
of
diagnosis
was
determined
using
National
Drug
Codes
(Supplementary Table 3, available online).
Statistical Analysis
Complications within two years of diagnosis were determined
using claims and included wound complication, infection, he-
matoma/seroma, breast pain, fat necrosis, radiation pneumoni-
tis, rib fracture, graft/implant complication, implant removal,
and other postoperative complications (Supplementary Table 4,
available online) (17–19). Risks of complications separately and
in aggregate by treatment were compared using the chi-square
test. The relative risk of complications was determined using
multivariable logistic regression with candidate covariables se-
lected based on a priori clinical significance and/or univariate
statistical significance (P < .25). The model was iteratively re-
fined to minimize collinearity. Goodness of fit was assessed us-
ing the Hosmer-Lemeshow method. Odds ratios were converted
to relative risks (20).
Cumulative net payer cost within two years of diagnosis was
calculated using all inpatient, outpatient, and carrier claims
from within two years of diagnosis. All costs were adjusted to
2014 dollars using the Prospective Payment System for inpatient

 claims and the Medicare Economic Index for outpatient claims.
Complication cost was determined by summing all costs occur-
ring on days when a diagnosis or procedure code indicating a
complication occurred. Noncomplication cost was the differ-
ence between total cost and complication cost and thus approx-
imates the cost of treatment in the absence of complications.
To account for highly skewed distribution of medical costs, gen-
eralized linear regression (log link function, gamma distribu-
tion) models were created for each cost outcome. Each cost
model began with the candidate variables listed in Table 1 and
was iteratively refined to optimize fit and minimize collinearity.
Exploratory analyses evaluated the impact of WBI fraction-
ation (hypofractionation: 15–22 treatments; conventional frac-
tionation: �23 treatments), unilateral vs bilateral mastectomy,
and type of breast reconstruction on complications and cost.
All statistical tests were two-sided, with a P value of .05 or
less indicating statistical significance. Analyses were conducted
using SAS v. 9.3 (Cary, NC) and STATA/MP 13.1 (College Station,
TX). LumpþWBI served as the referent category for all analyses.
The SEER-Medicare data set and the MarketScan data set are as-
sembled with different selection methodology. Therefore no di-
rect statistical comparisons or inferences between these two
groups were conducted. Our institutional review board granted
this study exempt status.
Results
Patient Characteristics and Extent of Complications
We identified 105 211 patients (44 344 MarketScan, 60 867
SEER-Medicare)
diagnosed
with
early-stage
breast
cancer
between 2000 and 2011. Baseline features are enumerated in
Table 1. LumpþWBI was the most common treatment in both
cohorts.
Unadjusted and adjusted total complication rates are pro-
vided in Figure 1 and Table 2, respectively. Rates of individual
complications
for
each
treatment
are
enumerated
in
Supplementary Table 5 (available online). MastþRecon was as-
sociated with the highest complication risk in all years studied
for both cohorts (Figure 1). In adjusted models, MastþRecon was
associated with a statistically significantly higher complication
risk than LumpþWBI (MarketScan: 54.3% vs 29.6%, relative risk
[RR] ¼ 1.87, 95% confidence interval [CI] ¼ 1.82 to 1.91, P < .001;
SEER-Medicare: 66.1% vs 37.6%, RR ¼ 1.75, 95% CI ¼ 1.69 to 1.82, P
< .001). Common complications after MastþRecon included in-
fection (24.5% for MarketScan, 30.9% for SEER-Medicare), hema-
toma/seroma (16.3%, 20.3%), implant removal (15.0%, 19.9%),
wound complication (12.8%, 11.7%, respectively), and graft/im-
plant complications (9.5%, 13.6%) (Supplementary Table 5, avail
able online). Unlike MastþRecon, Mast alone was not associated
with increased complication risk compared with LumpþWBI
(MarketScan: RR ¼ 0.88, 95% CI ¼ 0.85 to 0.91; SEER-Medicare:
RR ¼ 0.98, 95% CI ¼ 0.96 to 1.00).
Alternative breast conserving strategies were also com-
pared with LumpþWBI. In both cohorts, LumpþBrachy was as-
sociated
with
higher
complication
risk
than
LumpþWBI
(Marketscan: 44.5% vs 29.6%, RR ¼ 1.47, 95% CI ¼ 1.40 to 1.53;
SEER-Medicare: 50.6% vs 37.6%, RR ¼ 1.36, 95% CI ¼ 1.31 to 1.41).
In the SEER-Medicare population, where Lump alone is a
guideline-concordant treatment option for selected patients
(6), Lump alone was associated with lower complication risk
than LumpþWBI (30.5% vs 37.6%, RR ¼ 0.87, 95% CI ¼ 0.83 to
0.90).
Counterintuitively, Lump alone had modestly higher complica-
tions than LumpþWBI among the younger women in the
MarketScan cohort (31.0% vs 29.6%, RR¼ 1.10, 95% CI¼ 1.04 to
1.16). This result is likely because of the finding that 13.3% (335/
2513) of patients who underwent Lump alone (defined as within
the first year of diagnosis) subsequently underwent mastec-
tomy and reconstruction in the second year after diagnosis.
Furthermore, use of mastectomy and reconstruction in year 2, af-
ter initial management with Lump alone in year 1, increased sub-
stantially over time, rising to 36.2% (47/130) of patients initially
managed with Lump alone in 2011 in the MarketScan cohort.
We next performed exploratory analyses on treatment sub-
groups including hypofractionated WBI, bilateral mastectomy,
and subtypes of reconstruction (Supplementary Table 6, avail
able online). Hypofractionated WBI was associated with a simi-
lar rate of complications as conventional WBI (Marketscan:
RR ¼ 0.99, 95% CI ¼ 0.91 to 1.07; SEER-Medicare: RR ¼ 1.01, 95%
CI ¼ 0.96 to 1.07; referent hypofractionated WBI). In comparison
with LumpþWBI, bilateral Mast alone was associated with
higher complication risk in the Marketscan cohort (RR ¼ 1.21,
95% CI ¼ 1.10 to 1.33) but not in the SEER-Medicare cohort
(RR ¼ 1.07, 95% CI ¼ 0.96 to 1.18). In contrast, unilateral Mast
alone
was
associated
with
lower
complication
risk
than
LumpþWBI in the MarketScan cohort (RR ¼ 0.86, 95% CI ¼ 0.82
to 0.89) but not in the SEER-Medicare cohort (RR ¼ 0.98, 95% CI ¼
0.95 to 1.00).
For
patients
undergoing
MastþRecon,
both
bilateral
MastþRecon (MarketScan: RR ¼ 1.80, 95% CI ¼ 1.75 to 1.86; SEER-
Medicare: RR ¼ 1.83, 95% CI ¼ 1.68 to 1.96) and unilateral
MastþRecon (MarketScan: RR ¼ 1.80, 95% CI ¼ 1.75 to 1.84; SEER-
Medicare: RR ¼ 1.73, 95% CI ¼ 1.67 to 1.80) resulted in similar
complication risk relative to LumpþWBI. All reconstruction
techniques (implant, autologous tissue transfer, tissue expan-
ders, or a combination) were associated with statistically signif-
icantly higher complication risk than LumpþWBI (RR range ¼
1.47–2.20).
Cost
Trends in adjusted cost for each treatment are provided in
Supplementary Figure 1 (available online). All interventions ex-
perienced cost growth exceeding inflation among both patient
cohorts. For comparing costs, we included only patients diag-
nosed in the final two years of the study period so that costs ac-
crued
during
the
subsequent
24
months
would
reflect
contemporary expenditures. Table 3 stratifies the findings by
treatment strategy and highlights the portion attributable to
complications. Cost differentials relative to LumpþWBI are
graphically summarized in Figure 2.
In the MarketScan cohort, LumpþWBI was associated with
the lowest adjusted mean cumulative cost ($65 608) among op-
tions that provided a breast mound (ie, all treatments except for
Mast alone). MastþRecon was associated with a 34% higher ad-
justed cost per patient ($88 089) because of both cost of inter-
vention ($77 316 vs $63 834) and cost of complications ($10 402
vs $1385). In the SEER-Medicare cohort, MastþRecon was also
associated with higher adjusted mean cost than lumpectomy
plus WBI ($35 835 vs $34 087), which was attributable solely to
cost of complications ($2641 vs $549). Subgroup analysis showed
that bilateral MastþRecon and MastþRecon involving a combi-
nation of autologous transfer and implant were associated with
higher cost for both cohorts (Supplementary Table 7, available
online). Mast alone was associated with lower cost than

 LumpþWBI among
both
MarketScan
($48
258) and
SEER-
Medicare ($22 182) patients.
With regard to lumpectomy-based strategies, LumpþBrachy
was associated with $11 522 excess cost over LumpþWBI among
MarketScan patients and $3530 excess cost among SEER-
Medicare patients. In contrast, hypofractionated WBI was asso-
ciated
with
$2467
and
$4462
in
savings
per
patient
in
Marketscan and SEER-Medicare, respectively, compared with
conventional WBI (Supplementary Table 7, available online).
Among MarketScan patients, Lump alone ($70 520) was more
costly than LumpþWBI because of the cost associated with fre-
quent secondary surgeries performed in the second year after
diagnosis (Table 3). Among SEER-Medicare patients, Lump alone
was associated with the lowest cumulative costs ($21 005) of all
interventions.
Discussion
Utilizing two large databases comprised of younger women
with private insurance and older women with public insurance,
we characterized costs and complications during the first 24
months after diagnosis of early breast cancer treated with one
of five common local therapy strategies. Despite the consider-
able clinical and sociodemographic differences between the two
cohorts, we observed a striking concordance in the results of
our analysis. In both populations, MastþRecon was associated
with nearly two-fold increased complication risk compared
with LumpþWBI, a finding that persisted throughout the study
interval
of
2000
to
2011.
Additionally,
compared
with
LumpþWBI, MastþRecon yielded $22 481 higher total cost and
$9017 higher complication-related cost in the MarketScan co-
hort,
and
$1748
higher
total
cost
and
$2092
higher
complication-related cost in the SEER-Medicare cohort.
The direct comparison of complication risk and cost out-
comes between MastþRecon and LumpþWBI, in addition to the
three other treatment strategies included in this analysis, is a
novel addition to the literature, which informs ongoing public
health discussions aimed at identifying high-value treatment
options for common cancers. Prior literature has typically fo-
cused on comparing complications and cost within only one or
two treatment options (17,19,21–26) and thus lacks a compre-
hensive comparative assessment of all the common treatment
options typically presented to a patient with early breast cancer.

 that LumpþWBI was more expensive than mastectomy within
the first six months of diagnosis, but that mastectomy was
more expensive when including costs within five years. This
study was limited, though, as less than 5% of the sample under-
went breast reconstruction (23). As another example, our group
has
previously
reported
excess
complications
with
LumpþBrachy compared with LumpþWBI (17,19,21), but these
studies did not contextualize complications of brachytherapy
relative to mastectomy with or without reconstruction, which is
frequently the alternative to LumpþBrachy, the treatment con-
templated by patients seeking to avoid a protracted course of
WBI.
In recent years, there has been a marked increase in the use
of bilateral mastectomy and reconstruction to treat early breast
cancer (27–32). While some of these procedures are clearly med-
ically indicated, the choice for mastectomy is often driven by
nonmedical factors such as patient preferences for more “com-
plete” cancer treatment by extirpating the entirety of the af-
fected organ, patient fears of in-breast recurrence following
LumpþWBI, or patient anxiety regarding the need for ongoing
mammographic surveillance of the conserved breast (8). Our
finding of substantially higher cost of MastþRecon compared
with LumpþWBI highlights an important conflict that will be in-
creasingly confronted in an era focused on “value” in health
care. Specifically, patients may prefer a more expensive treat-
ment such as MastþRecon for nonmedical reasons when a less
expensive treatment such as LumpþWBI may be equally

 effective from a purely medical perspective. If such a patient is
receiving care from a health care entity with a financial stake in
promoting “high-value” care, the entity may profit financially if
the patient receives the lower-cost intervention and, con-
versely, may experience a financial loss if the patient receives
the higher-cost intervention. Developing a framework to guide
health care entities, physicians, and patients through such con-
flicted decisions will become increasingly important as innova-
tive reimbursement models employing episodic payments or
value-based insurance designs begin to permeate the market-
place (3).
Aside from the marked differences between MastþRecon
and LumpþWBI, our study findings also reveal important differ-
ences
in
cost
and
complications
across
the
different
lumpectomy-based options. Specifically, LumpþBrachy yielded
an approximately 40% higher relative risk of complications and
higher costs than LumpþWBI. The differences in cost were
mainly attributable to the procedure itself, as differences in cost
because of complications were small: $417 greater for brachy-
therapy in the MarketScan cohort and $159 greater in the SEER-
Medicare cohort. Notably, the shorter course of brachytherapy
may decrease indirect patient costs because of travel and lost
work and thereby offset a portion of its excess cost. Regarding
LumpþWBI,
our
findings
confirm
other
randomized
and
population-based studies, which have shown that hypofractio-
nated treatment reduces cost without increasing complications
(33–35). The opportunity to encourage this form of WBI should
be examined closely in light of recent evidence concluding that
only one-third of eligible American women receive hypofractio-
nated WBI (36).
Another key result is that Lump alone was a high-value in-
tervention in older patients, in whom it is considered guideline-
concordant (6). However, in the younger cohort, Lump alone
was associated with higher costs and complications because of
the high prevalence of mastectomy occurring in the second
year after diagnosis. The underlying cause of mastectomy—for
example, because of true local relapse vs fear of recurrence vs
initial pathological findings requiring mastectomy—cannot be
determined. However, these procedures and underlying causes
were not considered “complications” in our study design and
thus do not influence our finding of excess complications and
complication-related cost in this group. Finally, our study illus-
trates that mastectomy alone is a high-value intervention for
women who do not prioritize retaining a native or reconstructed
breast mound.
In interpreting results of this study, we note that not all indi-
vidual patients would have been eligible for every treatment
strategy. For example, a patient with early breast cancer may
have extensive premalignant changes in the breast or a heredi-
tary breast cancer syndrome, thus prompting treatment with
Mast alone or MastþRecon. Nevertheless, our population find-
ings remain broadly representative of actual aggregate out-
comes for American patients, the majority of whom are
candidates for multiple therapeutic approaches. Another limita-
tion is that analyses relied on the perspective of the payer and
were unable to evaluate outcomes such as patient satisfaction
or quality of life following one treatment compared with an-
other. Complementary patient-level data are needed to inform
physician-patient discussions on the entirety of the risks and
benefits of their treatment options. Thirdly, this study is limited
by the nature of claims data, which rely on the accuracy of
coders and are not comprehensive of all provider and patient
characteristics or all potential complications. Future studies
should also explore long-term costs, for example, the costs of
surveillance mammography and treating second cancers, which
are also likely to differ by chosen initial treatment. Finally, al-
though we adjusted for important clinical variables in all analy-
ses, residual confounding may exist in this retrospective study
design.
In conclusion, there are major differences in cost and com-
plication profile within two years of diagnosis among guideline-
concordant local treatment strategies for breast cancer. Mast
alone is a high-value treatment for patients who do not wish to
retain a breast mound. MastþRecon is associated with consider-
ably higher cost and complications. Lump alone can be a high-
value intervention for older patients but is not high value for
younger patients. Lumpectomy plus hypofractionated WBI
combines high oncologic effectiveness, breast preservation, and
a favorable complication profile. These findings should be help-
ful to patients contemplating their treatment options for early
breast cancer and will inform ongoing public health discussions
aimed at identifying high-value treatment options for common
cancers.
