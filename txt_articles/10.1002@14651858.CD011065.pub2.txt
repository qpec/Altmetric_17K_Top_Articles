Background
Tongue-tie, or ankyloglossia, is a condition whereby the lingual frenulum attaches near the tip of the tongue and may be short, tight
and thick. Tongue-tie is present in 4% to 11% of newborns. Tongue-tie has been cited as a cause of poor breastfeeding and maternal
nipple pain. Frenotomy, which is commonly performed, may correct the restriction to tongue movement and allow more effective
breastfeeding with less maternal nipple pain.
Objectives
To determine whether frenotomy is safe and effective in improving ability to feed orally among infants younger than three months of
age with tongue-tie (and problems feeding).
Also, to perform subgroup analysis to determine the following.
• Severity of tongue-tie before frenotomy as measured by a validated tool (e.g. Hazelbaker Assessment Tool for Lingual Frenulum
Function (ATLFF) scores < 11; scores ≥ 11) (Hazelbaker 1993).
• Gestational age at birth (< 37 weeks’ gestation; 37 weeks’ gestation and above).
• Method of feeding (breast or bottle).
• Age at frenotomy (≤ 10 days of age; > 10 days to three months of age).
• Severity of feeding difficulty (infants with feeding difficulty affecting weight gain (as assessed by infant’s not regaining birth weight
by day 14 or falling off centiles); infants with symptomatic feeding difficulty but thriving (greater than birth weight by day 14 and
tracking centiles).
Search methods
We searched the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL), MEDLINE, Embase and CINAHL up to January
2017, as well as previous reviews including cross-references, expert informants and journal handsearching. We searched clinical trials
databases for ongoing and recently completed trials. We applied no language restrictions.

 Selection criteria
Randomised, quasi-randomised controlled trials or cluster-randomised trials that compared frenotomy versus no frenotomy or freno-
tomy versus sham procedure in newborn infants.
Data collection and analysis
Review authors extracted from the reports of clinical trials data regarding clinical outcomes including infant feeding, maternal nipple
pain, duration of breastfeeding, cessation of breastfeeding, infant pain, excessive bleeding, infection at the site of frenotomy, ulceration
at the site of frenotomy, damage to the tongue and/or submandibular ducts and recurrence of tongue-tie. We used the GRADE approach
to assess the quality of evidence.
Main results
Five randomised trials met our inclusion criteria (n = 302). Three studies objectively measured infant breastfeeding using standardised
assessment tools. Pooled analysis of two studies (n = 155) showed no change on a 10-point feeding scale following frenotomy (mean
difference (MD) -0.1, 95% confidence interval (CI) -0.6 to 0.5 units on a 10-point feeding scale). A third study (n = 58) showed
objective improvement on a 12-point feeding scale (MD 3.5, 95% CI 3.1 to 4.0 units of a 12-point feeding scale). Four studies
objectively assessed maternal pain. Pooled analysis of three studies (n = 212) based on a 10-point pain scale showed a reduction in
maternal pain scores following frenotomy (MD -0.7, 95% CI -1.4 to -0.1 units on a 10-point pain scale). A fourth study (n = 58) also
showed a reduction in pain scores on a 50-point pain scale (MD -8.6, 95% CI -9.4 to -7.8 units on a 50-point pain scale). All studies
reported no adverse effects following frenotomy. These studies had serious methodological shortcomings. They included small sample
sizes, and only two studies blinded both mothers and assessors; one did not attempt blinding for mothers nor for assessors. All studies
offered frenotomy to controls, and most controls underwent the procedure, suggesting lack of equipoise. No study was able to report
whether frenotomy led to long-term successful breastfeeding.
Authors’ conclusions
Frenotomy reduced breastfeeding mothers’ nipple pain in the short term. Investigators did not find a consistent positive effect on infant
breastfeeding. Researchers reported no serious complications, but the total number of infants studied was small. The small number
of trials along with methodological shortcomings limits the certainty of these findings. Further randomised controlled trials of high
methodological quality are necessary to determine the effects of frenotomy.

Surgical release of tongue-tie for the treatment of tongue-tie in young babies
Review question: Tongue-tie is a potentially treatable cause of breastfeeding problems - if a baby is tongue-tied and is having feeding
difficulties, does releasing the tongue-tie help?
Background: Tongue-tie is a condition whereby the membrane between the tongue and the floor of the mouth is too tight or too
short. This may cause feeding problems for the baby and/or nipple pain for a breastfeeding mother.
Study characteristics: Five randomised controlled trials enrolling 302 infants met the inclusion criteria.
Key results: In an infant with tongue-tie and feeding difficulties, surgical release of the tongue-tie does not consistently improve infant
feeding but is likely to improve maternal nipple pain. Further research is needed to clarify and confirm this effect.
Quality of evidence: The quality of the evidence is very low to moderate because overall only a small number of studies have looked
at this condition, the total number of babies included in these studies was low and some studies could have been better designed.

Description of the condition
The lingual frenulum is a fold of mucous membrane that extends
from the floor of the mouth to the midline of the underside of the
tongue. It helps to stabilise the base of the tongue and does not
normally interfere with tongue tip movement (Marchesan 2005).
Tongue-tie (ankyloglossia) is a condition in which the lingual
frenulum has an anterior attachment near the tip of the tongue
and may be unusually short, tight and thick (Jackson 2012). This
causes virtual adhesion of the tongue tip to the floor of the mouth
and can result in restricted tongue tip movement (Marchesan
2005). The exactcause of ’tongue-tie’ (ankyloglossia)isnotknown.
Genetics may play a role, as the condition tends to run in some
families (Coryllos 2004). Prevalence is about 4% to 11% among
newborns (Hogan 2005; Messner 2000a; Messner 2000b; Ricke
2005).
Tongue-tie has been cited as a cause of poor breastfeeding because
the infant is unable to attach or stay latched on, and because mater-
nal nipple pain may result (Coryllos 2004; Hogan 2005). In older
children and adults, tongue-tie has been implicated as a cause of
speech delay, abnormal dentition, poor oral hygiene and inability
to play wind instruments (Krol 2007). As an infant breastfeeds, the
tongue moves with peristalsis over maternal lactiferous sinuses and
extracts milk. When the infant’s tongue movement is restricted, as
is the case with severe tongue-tie, reduced movement may affect
milk extraction, and friction may be present between the tongue
or gums and the nipple, causing damage to the nipple and mater-
nal pain (Coryllos 2004; Hogan 2005). References to tongue-tie
causing speech problems date back to Aristotle in the third cen-
tury BC (Obladen 2010). The association between breastfeeding
difficulty and tongue-tie has been recognised for at least 500 years
(Obladen 2010). In recent years, with recognition and encour-
agement of exclusive breastfeeding as the optimal primary mode
of infant feeding, the justification for frenotomy has shifted from
improving speech problems to improving breastfeeding (Obladen
2010), re-igniting the historical debate as to the role of tongue-tie
in breastfeeding difficulties (Kumar 2012).
The diagnosis of tongue-tie depends on an assessment of the struc-
ture and function of the lingual frenulum. Diagnostic classifica-
tion systems vary from simple visual inspection and/or palpation
of the frenulum to a more complex multi-scale classification sys-
tem such as the Hazelbaker Assessment Tool for Lingual Frenulum
Function (ATLFF) (Hazelbaker 1993). The ATLFF is a highly re-
liable screening tool (Amir 2006) that was designed to be used in
assessment of infants younger than three months of age. It assesses
the function and appearance of the frenulum. A score of 14 indi-
cates normal function, between 11 and 14 is acceptable and less
than 11 indicates significant tongue-tie that requires frenotomy.
An appearance scale includes values to 10, and lower scores indi-
cate tongue-tie. A score lower than eight is suggestive of tongue-
tie, but surgery is not recommended unless a functional problem
is noted.
Description of the intervention
Frenotomy and frenuloplasty are the two main surgical proce-
dures used in the treatment of infants with tongue-tie (Lalakea
2002). Frenotomy, or clipping of the frenulum, is the procedure
of choice in infants because it is relatively quick and easy to per-
form. The infant is swaddled and is placed supine on the exam-
ining table, while an assistant supports the head and neck. The
clinician/surgeon elevates the tongue and exposes the frenulum,
which is then incised with sharp, straight, blunt-ended scissors
(Berry 2012; Hogan 2005). Some operators describe crushing the
frenulum before incision. Direct pressure is then applied to the
frenulum with a piece of gauze. Bleeding is reportedly scant and
is controlled by the pressure (Lalakea 2002). The incision usually
is not sutured, and the infant most often recovers quickly from
the procedure and is able to feed directly afterwards. In infants,
frenotomy is usually performed without analgesia or anaesthetic
(Lalakea 2002). The use of a laser to perform the frenotomy is
becoming more frequent (Kotlow 2011).
Frenuloplasty, an operation that lengthens the frenulum, is the
preferred procedure for patients over one year of age (Lalakea
2002). This intervention will not be included in this review.
How the intervention might work
Surgical release of the tongue-tie through frenotomy may correct
the restriction to infant tongue movement during feeding to allow
more effective breastfeedingandlessmaternal nipple painresulting
from decreased friction between the infant’s lower gum/tongue
and the nipple (Kumar 2012).
Why it is important to do this review
Diagnosis and management of tongue-tie remain controversial.
It is uncertain whether ankyloglossia is a congenital oral anomaly
requiring treatment or a normal variant. One survey (Messner
2000b) found that most lactation consultants believe tongue-tie
to be a frequent cause of infant breastfeeding difficulties that could
be solved by frenotomy. In marked contrast, 90% of paediatri-
cians and 70% of otolaryngologists believe that tongue-tie never,
or rarely, causes a feeding problem (Messner 2000a). However,
medical organisations such as the American Academy of Pediatrics
(Coryllos 2004) and the National Institute for Health and Care
Excellence (NICE 2005) now acknowledge that tongue-tie, or
ankyloglossia, is a significant clinical entity that should be treated
as early as possible to minimise breastfeeding problems. Given that
breastfeeding benefits both infants and mothers, it is important

feeding (Edmunds 2011).
O B J E C T I V E S
To determine whether frenotomy is safe and effective in improving
ability to feed orally among infants younger than three months of
age with tongue-tie (and problems feeding).
Subgroup analysis
• Severity of tongue-tie before frenotomy as measured by a
validated tool (e.g. ATLFF (scores < 11; scores ≥ 11))
(Hazelbaker 1993).
• Gestational age at birth (< 37 weeks’ gestation; 37 weeks’
gestation and above).
• Method of feeding (breast or bottle).
• Age at frenotomy (≤ 10 days of age; > 10 days to three
months of age).
• Severity of feeding difficulty (infants with feeding difficulty
affecting weight gain (as assessed by infant’s not regaining birth
weight by day 14 or falling off centiles); infants with
symptomatic feeding difficulty but thriving (greater than birth
weight by day 14 and tracking centiles).

Criteria for considering studies for this review
Types of studies
Randomised or quasi-randomised controlled trials or cluster-ran-
domised trials.
Types of participants
Infants three months of age or younger with a diagnosis of tongue-
tie who are orally feeding. To be included, another problem must
be present that could be related to the tongue-tie, specifically,
infant feeding problems or maternal nipple pain in a breastfeeding
mother. We planned to exclude patients with other coexisting oral
pathology that might affect oral feeding, for example, cleft palate.
Types of interventions
• Frenotomy versus no frenotomy. Lactation consultant
interventions were accepted if provided to both groups.
• Frenotomy versus sham procedure. Lactation consultant
interventions were accepted if provided to both groups.
Types of outcome measures
Primary outcomes
• Infant feeding assessed within 48 hours, within two to
seven days and after seven days following the procedure with the
use of a validated scale such as the LATCH score (Jensen 1994)
or the Infant Breastfeeding Assessment Tool (IBFAT) (Mathews
1988). The LATCH is a scoring system that assesses latch,
swallowing, maternal nipple, maternal comfort and assistance
the mother needs to position the infant. Each area gets a score
between 0 and 2 with a total possible score of 10. The IBFAT
assesses readiness to feed, rooting, fixing (latching on) and
sucking. Each item is scored between 0 and 3, and a score of 10
to 12 represents successful breastfeeding. Bottle-feeding will be
assessed within 48 hours, within two to seven days and after
seven days following the procedure, subjectively, by reports of
more efficient sucking and less drooling
Secondary outcomes
• Maternal nipple pain assessed within 48 hours, within two
to seven days and after seven days following frenotomy by a
validated pain scale (e.g. Short-Form McGill Pain Questionnaire
(SF-MPQ)) (Melzack 1975)
• Qualitative assessment of infant feeding by parental survey
performed within 48 hours of the procedure
• Duration of breastfeeding (days)
• Cessation of breastfeeding as assessed by maternal report
within four weeks of the procedure
• Infant pain as assessed by a validated pain scale (e.g.
Modified Behavioral Pain Scale (MBPS) (Taddio 1995),
Neonatal Infant Pain Scale (NIPS) (Lawrence 1993), CRIES
pain scale (cries, requires oxygen, shows increased vital signs and
expression and is sleepless) (Krechel 1995)) before, during and
up to one hour post frenotomy
• Excessive bleeding at the time or within 24 hours of
frenotomy (as determined by study investigators)
• Infection at the site of frenotomy requiring treatment with
antibiotics within seven days of the procedure
• Damage to the tongue or submandibular ducts noted
within seven days of the procedure (as determined by study
investigators)

 MEDLINE (1966 to January 2016), Embase (1980 to January
2016) and the Cumulative Index to Nursing and Allied Health Lit-
erature (CINAHL; 1982 to January 2016), and searched previous
reviews including cross-references, expert informants and journal
handsearching. We searched MEDLINE, Embase and CINAHL
for relevant articles using the following search terms: Infant AND
Tongue Tie, Infant OR Newborn OR neonate (explode) [MeSH
heading] AND Tongue Tie (explode) [MeSH heading] OR anky-
loglossia. and Frenotomy [MeSH heading] OR Frenulotomy OR
Frenuloplasy [MeSH heading]. We applied no language restric-
tions. We also searched clinical trial registries for current and re-
cently completed trials (Australia and New Zealand Clinical Tri-
als Register (ANZCTR); clinicaltrials.gov; controlled-trials.com;
who.int/ictrp; and Oxford Database of Perinatal Trials).
Searching other resources
The search strategy included communication with expert infor-
mants and searches of bibliographies of reviews and trials for ref-
erences to other trials, as well as searches of previous reviews in-
cluding cross-references, abstracts and conferences and symposia
proceedings of the Perinatal Society of Australia and New Zealand
and the Pediatric Academic Societies (American Pediatric Society,
Society for Pediatric Research and European Society for Pediatric
Research) from 1990 to 2015. We planned to contact the corre-
sponding investigator of any unpublished trials to request infor-
mation. We considered unpublished studies and studies reported
only as abstracts as eligible for review if final trial data were avail-
able. We intended to contact the corresponding authors of iden-
tified randomised controlled trials (RCTs) to ask for additional
information about their studies if we required further data.
Data collection and analysis
We used the standard methods of Cochrane as documented in the
Cochrane Handbook for Systematic Reviews of Interventions (Higgins
2011) and the methods of the Cochrane Neonatal Review Group
(CNRG).
Selection of studies
Review authors independently assessed for inclusion all potential
studies identified by the search strategy. We resolved disagreements
through discussion.
Specifically, we:
• merged search results by using reference management
software and removed duplicate records of the same report;
• examined titles and abstracts to remove irrelevant reports;
• retrieved full text of potentially relevant reports;
• linked together multiple reports of the same study;
• examined full-text reports to assess for compliance of
studies meeting eligibility criteria;
• corresponded with investigators, when appropriate, to
clarify study eligibility;
• at all stages noted reasons for inclusion and exclusion of
articles; and
• made final decisions on study inclusion and proceeded to
data collection.
Data extraction and management
Review authors independently extracted data from full-text arti-
cles using a specifically designed spreadsheet to manage the infor-
mation. We resolved discrepancies through discussion; if required,
we intended to consult a review arbiter. We entered data into Re-
view Manager software 5.3 (RevMan 2014) and checked them for
accuracy.
Assessment of risk of bias in included studies
We used the standardised review methods of the CNRG (http://
neonatal.cochrane.org/en/index.html) to assess the methodologi-
cal quality of included studies. Review authors independently as-
sessed study quality and risk of bias using the following criteria,
as documented in the Cochrane Handbook for Systematic Reviews
of Interventions (Higgins 2011).
• Random sequence generation: Was the allocation sequence
adequately generated?
• Allocation concealment: Was allocation adequately
concealed?
• Blinding of participants and personnel for each main
outcome or class of outcomes: Was knowledge of the allocated
intervention adequately prevented during the study?
• Blinding of outcome assessors: Were the outcome assessors
blinded?
• Incomplete outcome data for each main outcome or class of
outcomes: Were incomplete data adequately addressed?
• Selective outcome reporting: Are reports of the study free of
the suggestion of selective outcome reporting? We tried to locate
protocols to assess outcome reporting bias.
• Other sources of bias: Was the study apparently free of
other problems that could put it at high risk of bias? We gave
particular attention to completeness of follow-up of all randomly
assigned infants and to the length of follow-up studies to identify
whether any benefits claimed were robust.
We intended to request additional information and clarification
of published data from the authors of individual trials if required.
We assessed each trial for risk of bias based on the criteria listed
above and marked each as:
• ’low’ risk of bias;
• ’unclear’ risk of bias; or
• ’high’ risk of bias.
We judged each criterion as being at ’low risk’ of bias, ’high risk’ of
bias or ’unclear’ risk of bias (for lack of information or uncertainty
over the potential for bias).

 Measures of treatment effect
We analysed the results of included studies using the statistical
package Review Manager software 5.3 (RevMan 2014).
We used the standard method of the CNRG, applying a fixed-
effect model for meta-analysis. In assessing treatment effects for
dichotomous data, we reported the risk ratio (RR) and the risk
difference (RD), along with 95% confidence intervals, for cate-
gorical outcomes. If the RD was statistically significant, we calcu-
lated the number needed to treat for an additional beneficial out-
come (NNTB) and the number needed to treat for an additional
harmful outcome (NNTH) (1/RD). For outcomes measured on
a continuous scale, we used the weighted mean difference, along
with 95% confidence intervals.
Included studies reported outcomes of change in infant feeding
ability and in maternal pain using different validated scales. For
infant feeding, researchers presented LATCH scores (a 10-point
scale) and IBFAT scores (a 12-point scale). Included studies re-
ported maternal pain assessed by the 10-point visual analogue pain
scale and the 50-point SF-MPQ. As these different scales rely on
very different units of reporting and show subtle differences, we
did not combine scores for analysis, and we presented results in
subgroups according to the different scales used.
Unit of analysis issues
We combined randomised trials in a single meta-analysis using the
generic inverse variance method.
Dealing with missing data
We planned to contact the authors of all published studies if we
required clarification or additional information. We planned to
describe the number of participants with missing data in the Re-
sults section and in the Characteristics of included studies table.
We presented results only for available participants. We intended
to discuss the implications of missing data in the Discussion sec-
tion of the review.
Assessment of heterogeneity
We usedRevMan5.3(RevMan 2014)toassessthe heterogeneityof
treatment effects between trials. We used the two formal statistical
approaches described below.
• Chi2 test for homogeneity: We calculated whether statistical
heterogeneity is present by using the Chi2 test for homogeneity
(P < 0.1). Because this test has low power when the number of
studies included in the meta-analysis is small, we set the
probability at the 10% level of significance (Higgins 2011).
• I2 statistic, to ensure that pooling of data was valid: We
quantified the impact of statistical heterogeneity by using I2
statistics available in RevMan 2014, which describes the
percentage of total variation across studies due to heterogeneity
rather than to sampling error. We graded the degree of
heterogeneity as follows: 0% to 30%: potentially trivial (not
important) heterogeneity; 31% to 50%: low heterogeneity; 51%
to 75%: moderate heterogeneity; and 76% to 100%: high
heterogeneity. Had we found evidence of apparent or statistical
heterogeneity, we planned to assess the source of heterogeneity
by performing sensitivity and post hoc subgroup analyses to look
for sources of bias or methodological differences between
heterogeneous trials (e.g. differences in study quality,
participants, intervention regimens, outcome assessments).
Assessment of reporting biases
We tried to obtain the study protocols of all included studies to
compare outcomes reported in the protocol versus those reported
in the findings for each of the included studies. We intended to
investigate reporting and publication bias by examining the de-
gree of asymmetry of a funnel plot if we identified 10 or more
trials. When we suspected reporting bias (see selective reporting
bias above), we intended to contact study authors to ask them to
provide missing outcome data. When this was not possible and
we suspected that missing data might introduce serious bias, we
intended to explore the impact of including such studies in the
overall assessment of results by performing a sensitivity analysis.
Data synthesis
We performed statistical analyses according to the recom-
mendations of the CNRG (http://neonatal.cochrane.org/en/
index.html). We analysed all randomly assigned infants on an in-
tention-to-treat (ITT) basis. We analysed treatment effects in in-
dividual trials and used a fixed-effect model for meta-analysis in
the first instance to combine the data. When substantial hetero-
geneity existed, we examined the potential cause of heterogeneity
by performing subgroup and sensitivity analyses. When we judged
the meta-analysis to be inappropriate, we analysed and interpreted
individual trials separately. For estimates of typical risk ratio and
risk difference, we used the Mantel-Haenszel method. For mea-
sured quantities, we used the inverse variance method.
Quality of evidence
We used the Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Devel-
opment and Evaluation (GRADE) approach, as outlined in the
GRADE Handbook (Schünemann 2013), to assess the quality of
evidence for infant breastfeeding when assessed by a validated scale
and maternal nipple pain.
Two review authors independently assessed the quality of the ev-
idence for each of the outcomes above. We considered evidence
from RCTs as high quality but downgraded the evidence one level
for serious (or two levels for very serious) limitations on the basis
of the following: design (risk of bias), consistency across studies,
directness of the evidence, precision of estimates and presence of
8

 publication bias. We used the GRADEpro Guideline Develop-
ment Tool to create Summary of findings for the main comparison
to report the quality of the evidence.
The GRADE approach results in an assessment of the quality of
a body of evidence according to one of four grades.
• High: We are very confident that the true effect lies close to
that the estimate of effect.
• Moderate: We are moderately confident in the effect
estimate: The true effect is likely to be close to the estimate of
effect but may be substantially different.
• Low: Our confidence in the effect estimate is limited: The
true effect may be substantially different from the estimate of
effect.
• Very low: We have very little confidence in the effect
estimate: The true effect is likely to be substantially different
from the estimate of effect
Subgroup analysis and investigation of heterogeneity
We planned to carry out the following subgroup analyses.
• Severity of tongue-tie as measured by a validated tool (e.g.
ATLFF (scores < 11; scores ≥ 11)) (Hazelbaker 1993).
• Gestational age at birth (< 37 weeks’ gestation; 37 weeks’
gestation and above).
• Method of feeding (breast or bottle).
• Age at frenotomy (≤ 10 days of age; > 10 days to three
months of age).
• Severity of feeding difficulty (infants with feeding difficulty
affecting weight gain (assessed by infant’s not regaining birth
weight by day 14 or dropping off centiles by three months);
infants with feeding difficulty but normal weight gain).
Sensitivity analysis
We intended to explore methodological heterogeneity through the
use of sensitivity analysis. We classified studies as having low risk
of bias if they had adequate sequence generation and allocation
concealment and reported losses less than 10% on ITT analysis.

 Included studies
We included five small trials in this review (N = 302).
• Berry 2012 is a single-centre study performed in the United
Kingdom.
◦ Objective: to investigate if an immediate and sustained
improvement in breastfeeding occurs following frenotomy.
◦ Population: infants younger than four months of age
with tongue-tie and breastfeeding difficulties.
◦ Intervention: infants randomised to frenotomy or no
frenotomy.
◦ Outcomes: subjective and objective feeding assessment
and maternal pain scores.
• Buryk 2011 is a single-centre study performed in America.
◦ Objective: to investigate if frenotomy decreased
maternal pain, improved breastfeeding scores and led to
breastfeeding over a longer period.
◦ Population: infants younger than 30 days of age with
breastfeeding difficulties whose mothers experienced nipple pain.
◦ Intervention: infants randomised to frenotomy or
sham procedure.
◦ Outcomes: change in maternal pain scores and infant
feeding scores.
• Dollberg 2006 is a single-centre study performed in Israel.
◦ Objective: to investigate if frenotomy in infants with
ankyloglossia improves nipple pain and/or latching on during
attempts to breastfeed.
◦ Population: breastfeeding infants younger than 21
days of age whose mothers were experiencing nipple pain.
◦ Intervention: infants randomised to frenotomy
followed by a sham procedure or a sham procedure followed by
frenotomy.
◦ Outcomes: change in maternal pain scores and infant
latch scores.
• Emond 2013 is a single-centre study performed in the
United Kingdom.
◦ Objective: to investigate if immediate frenotomy was
superior to breastfeeding support.
◦ Population: breastfeeding infants younger than two
weeks of age with mild to moderate tongue-tie and breastfeeding
difficulties.
◦ Intervention: infants randomised to frenotomy or
standard care.
◦ Outcomes: change in breastfeeding scores and
maternal pain scores.
• Hogan 2005 is a single-centre study performed in the
United Kingdom.
◦ Objective: to investigate if frenotomy was superior to
standard care in infants with tongue-tie and feeding difficulties.
◦ Population: bottle-feeding and breastfeeding infants
with tongue-tie and feeding difficulty.
◦ Intervention: infants randomised to intensive lactation
support or frenotomy.
◦ Outcomes: subjective improvement in feeding.
Excluded studies
See Characteristics of excluded studies. We excluded two studies
(Ngerncham 2013; Yousefi 2015) - the first because it was a cross-
sectional study with no control group, the second because it com-
pared frenotomy versus frenuloplasty in children up to 12 years of
age.
Risk of bias in included studies
We included in the analysis randomised controlled trials that com-
pared frenotomy versus no frenotomy or frenotomy versus sham
procedure in newborn infants. Overall, the five included trials had
small study populations and a high incidence of methodological
shortcomings. We discuss below specific methodological issues re-
garding these studies. See the risk of bias graph in Figure 2 and
summary in Figure 3.

 Allocation
Random sequence generation
All five studies reported the method of randomisation. Berry 2012,
Buryk 2011, Dollberg 2006 and Hogan 2005 used computer-gen-
erated randomisation, and Emond 2013 used independent tele-
phone-based randomisation.
Allocation concealment
Four studies described the methods used to conceal allocation.
Berry 2012 and Hogan 2005 used sealed envelopes created by a
person not involved in the trial, and Dollberg 2006 used sealed
envelopes and specified that the envelopes were opaque but did
not state who created them. Emond 2013 used a randomisation
code that was kept by an independent body. Buryk 2011 did not
state how investigators concealed allocation.
Blinding
Blinding of participants and research or clinical personnel
All five studies reported this. Hogan 2005 did not blind par-
ticipants nor personnel. Buryk 2011 performed single-blinding
(mothers only, not treating personnel), Emond 2013 also used sin-
gle-blinding (researchers blinded, mothers not blinded) and Berry
2012 and Dollberg 2006 blinded both participants and personnel.
Blinding of outcome assessment
All five studies reported this. Berry 2012, Buryk 2011 and
Dollberg 2006 blinded the assessor. Emond 2013 blinded the as-
sessor of the primary outcome and assessors of some secondary
outcomes but did not blind the mother and did not blind the
assessors of other secondary outcomes. Hogan 2005 was an un-
blinded study.
Incomplete outcome data
Exclusions after randomisation
Berry 2012 had three postrandomisation exclusions (5% of ran-
domised participants), and Dollberg 2006 had one postrandomi-
sation exclusion (4% of randomised participants). Both studies
reported that exclusions were due to failure of blinding. Emond
2013 had one postrandomisation exclusion (< 1% of randomised
participants) resulting from loss to follow-up. Buryk 2011 and
Hogan 2005 had no postrandomisation exclusions.
Selective reporting
Two studies selectively reported outcomes. Berry 2012 reported
that infant latch onto the breast objectively improved but did
not provide data; Berry 2012 also reported on breastfeeding suc-
cess at three months but did not report results by study group.
Buryk 2011 reported no differences between groups in longer-
term breastfeeding rates but did not present results of the two
groups separately. Dollberg 2006 reported changes in pain scores
before and after the intervention in the intervention arm only and
on request produced scores for the control arm.
Other potential sources of bias
All five studies offered and provided frenotomy to control in-
fants, suggesting lack of equipoise. Two studies - Berry 2012 and
Dollberg 2006 - performed frenotomy on all participants as part
of the study protocol. Buryk 2011, Emond 2013 and Hogan 2005
offered frenotomy to controls and had uptakes of 77% to 97%.
Effects of interventions
See: Summary of findings for the main comparison Frenotomy
compared with no frenotomy or sham procedure in infants with
tongue-tie and feeding difficulties
Frenotomy versus no frenotomy or sham procedure
Five studies compared frenotomy versus no frenotomy (Berry
2012; Emond 2013; Hogan 2005) or frenotomy versus sham pro-
cedure (Buryk 2011; Dollberg 2006). We summarise the main
findings in Summary of findings for the main comparison.
Primary outcomes
Infant feeding assessed with a validated tool (Analysis 1.1)
Four trials provided outcome data for this comparison (Berry
2012; Buryk 2011; Dollberg 2006; Emond 2013). Three studies
reported improvement in infant breastfeeding assessed with a val-
idated scale (Buryk 2011; Dollberg 2006; Emond 2013) based on
two different measurement scales (Analysis 1.1; Figure 4).

Forest plot of comparison: 1 Frenotomy versus no frenotomy or sham procedure, outcome: 1.1
Infant breastfeeding assessed by a validated scale.
• IBFAT score (Buryk 2011): MD 3.50 on a 12-point scale,
95% CI 3.06 to 3.94; 58 participants (Analysis 1.1.1).
• LATCH score (Dollberg 2006; Emond 2013): MD -0.07
on a 10-point scale, 95% CI -0.63 to 0.48; 155 participants
(heterogeneity: Chi² = 0.02, df = 1, P = 0.88; I² = 0%) (Analysis
1.1.2).
A fourth trial (Berry 2012) also reported that infants in the inter-
vention group had higher LATCH scores after the intervention
but provided no data.
We did not combine LATCH and IBFAT scores for meta-analy-
sis, as studies had a high degree of heterogeneity and scales used
different units of measure.
Subgroup analyses
Severity of tongue-tie
One trial included only infants with severe tongue-tie (Buryk
2011) and reported improvement in infant breastfeeding (increase
in IBFAT scores) in the frenotomy group compared with the con-
trol group: MD 3.50 on a 12-point scale, 95% CI 3.06 to 3.94;
58 participants.
One trial included only infants with moderate tongue-tie (Emond
2013) and found no objective improvement in feeding scores: MD
-0.10 on a 10-point scale, 95% CI -0.75 to 0.55; 105 participants.
Timing of feeding assessment
Two trials reported on infant breastfeeding within 48 hours of the
intervention (Buryk 2011; Dollberg 2006).
• IBFAT score (Buryk 2011): MD 3.50 on a 12-point scale,
95% CI 3.06 to 3.94; 58 participants.
• LATCH score (Dollberg 2006): MD 0.0 on a 10-point
scale, 95% CI -1.08 to 1.08; 50 participants.
One trial (Emond 2013) reported no difference in LATCH scores
assessed between two and seven days after the intervention: MD -
0.10 on a 10-point scale, 95% CI -0.75 to 0.55; 105 participants
(Analysis 1.2).
Subgroup analysis by gestational age or by severity of feeding diffi-
culty ormethod of feeding was not possible owing to lack of data.
Secondary outcomes
Effect on maternal nipple pain (Analysis 1.3)
Four trials reported this outcome (Berry 2012; Buryk 2011;
Dollberg 2006; Emond 2013) using two different scales.
• Berry 2012, Dollberg 2006 and Emond 2013 assessed this
outcome after the first breastfeed using a 10-point visual
analogue pain scale. Meta-analysis showed a significant reduction
in maternal nipple pain in the frenotomy group compared with
the control group: MD -0.74, 95% CI -1.35 to -0.13
(heterogeneity: Chi² = 1.85, df = 2, P = 0.40; I² = 0%) (Analysis
1.3.1).
• Buryk 2011 used the 50-point SF-MPQ Pain Assessment
Tool after five days of feeding and found a significant reduction
in the frenotomy group compared with the control group: MD -
8.60, 95% CI -9.37 to -7.83 (Analysis 1.3.2).
We didnotcombine visual analogue painscale andSF-MPQ scores
for meta-analysis because studies had a high degree of heterogene-
ity and scales used different units of measure.

 Qualitative assessment of infant feeding by parental survey
performed within 48 hours of the procedure (Analysis 1.4)
Two trials (Berry 2012; Hogan 2005) reported high rates of im-
provement in breastfeeding following frenotomy compared with
control (typical risk ratio (RR) 3.48, 95% CI 2.18 to 5.56). The
meta-analysiscontainedhigh levelsof heterogeneity(Chi²=15.63,
df = 1, P < 0.0001; I² = 94%) (Figure 5).
Figure 5.
Forest plot of comparison: 1 Frenotomy versus no frenotomy or sham procedure, outcome: 1.6
Qualitative assessment of infant feeding by parental survey performed within 48 hours of the procedure.
Hogan 2005 reported that all intervention infants (n = 8) versus
no control infants (n = 9) had improved bottle-feeding.
Emond 2013 obtained qualitative data from a subgroup of the
study population and found that most parents reported improve-
ment in infant feeding directly after the intervention and in the
days that followed, but investigators did not state when they per-
formed the survey.
Duration of breastfeeding or cessation of breastfeeding as
assessed by maternal report within four weeks of the
procedure
No trial reported the duration of breastfeeding or cessation of
breastfeeding as assessed by maternal report within four weeks.
However, four studies reported on rates of breastfeeding at specific
time points. Berry 2012 reported that 58/59 were breastfeeding at
three months but did not report this by treatment group. Buryk
2011 reported that 36/58 were breastfeeding at two months, 23/
58 at six months and 14/58 at 12 months. Study authors also did
not report by treatment group. Emond 2013 reported that at eight
weeks, 43/52 in the intervention group and 40/50 in the control
group were at least partially breastfed. Hogan 2005 reported that
12/20 in the intervention group and 10/20 in the control group
were breastfed for at least four months.
Infant pain assessed by a validated pain scale before, during
and up to one hour post frenotomy
None of the included studies reported this outcome.
Excessive bleeding at the time or within 24 hours of
frenotomy (Analysis 1.5)
No infants in any of the five trials experienced excessive bleeding
following the intervention (RR not estimable; RD 0.00, 95% CI
-0.03 to 0.03; 302 participants).
Infection at the site of frenotomy requiring treatment with
antibiotics within seven days of the procedure (Analysis 1.6)
No infants in any of the five trials experienced infection at the
interventionsite requiringantibiotics(RRnotestimable;RD0.00,
95% CI -0.03 to 0.03; 302 participants).

Summary of main results
We included in this review five trials with a total sample size of 302
infants. Only one small trial reported that frenotomy objectively

 improved infant breastfeeding (Buryk 2011). Pooled analysis of
two other trials (N = 155) showed no objective change following
frenotomy(Dollberg 2006; Emond2013)butshowedconsistently
reduced maternal nipple pain.
Studies to date have not answered the clinically relevant question
of whether frenotomy in tongue-tied infants with feeding difficul-
ties results in longer-term breastfeeding success and resolution of
maternal pain. No studies reported duration of breastfeeding by
group, and all had very high contamination rates in the control
group, making longer-term outcomes meaningless.
Overall completeness and applicability of
evidence
All studies were performed at maternity hospitals in the United
Kingdom, America and Israel. All centres that carried out the stud-
ieshadlactationsupportandfrenotomyreadilyavailable. The total
number of infants studied to date is 302. This number is too small
to confirm the efficacy and safety of frenotomy, even though no
study reported any significant adverse effects. Populations studied
to date were healthy term infants with moderate or severe tongue-
tie. All primary outcomes were short-term, many assessed after
just one feed following intervention. Some studies followed up
infants for several months after the intervention, but as the con-
tamination rate within the control group was very high, longer-
term results are meaningless. Studies to date have not answered the
clinically relevant question of whether frenotomy in tongue-tied
infants results in longer-term breastfeeding success and resolution
of maternal pain.
The potential to improve infant breastfeeding while reducing ma-
ternal nipple pain may be greatest when an infant is given the
diagnosis of severe tongue-tie. However, only one trial has studied
frenotomy in this population. Again, only one study has exam-
ined frenotomy in infants given the diagnosis of moderate tongue-
tie and found that frenotomy did not have an objective effect on
infant feeding nor on maternal nipple pain but was subjectively
effective.
Quality of the evidence
We assessed the quality of the evidence using the GRADE method
and classified evidence for major outcomes as low quality on the
basis of small sample sizes (both in individual studies and in com-
bined studies), inconsistent blinding and high risk of bias. The
included studies had low rates of participant drop-out. Most study
authors responded when we requested further information. We
noted high degrees of heterogeneity between studies and observed
that investigators used different diagnostic tools to diagnose the
condition, reported differing degrees of tongue-tie severity and
used different scales to assess outcomes. The greatest weakness
among studies to date is that investigators offered frenotomy to all
controls and provided the procedure for a large majority of them,
which strongly implies lack of equipoise about effectiveness of the
intervention during the study and reduces the quality of results.
Potential biases in the review process
We used the standard methods of the Cochrane Neonatal Review
Group in conducting this systematic review. Our inclusive search
strategy would have included all relevant studies.
Agreements and disagreements with other
studies or reviews
Several other published reviews have examined effects of freno-
tomy for tongue-tie in young infants (Algar 2009; Bowley 2014;
CADTH 2016; Cho 2010; Edmunds 2011; Francis 2015; Hall
2005; Hong 2013; Ito 2014; Lalakea 2003; Power 2015; Segal
2007; Suter 2009). All included observational studies as well as
randomised trials. All reviews recognised a role for frenotomy
when evidence indicates feeding difficulties or maternal nipple
pain. However, review authors provided different interpretations
of the strength of available evidence supporting frenotomy. Algar
2009, Bowley 2014, Cho 2010, Edmunds 2011, Hong 2013, Ito
2014, Lalakea 2003 and Segal 2007 concluded that evidence is
sufficient to recommend frenotomy in an infant with breastfeed-
ing problems and tongue-tie. CADTH 2016, Hall 2005, Power
2015, Suter 2009 and Francis 2015 concluded that frenotomy
may be helpful and is safe but that definitive evidence is lacking.
The most recent review (CADTH 2016) concluded that freno-
tomy is a safe procedure that leads to maternally perceived benefit
in short-term breastfeeding outcomes, concurring with this review
that objective improvement in symptoms and long-term benefit is
less certain. CADTH 2016 concluded that it remains to be proved
whether frenotomy provides meaningful improvement in breast-
feeding difficulties, especially over the long term. Another recent
review (Francis 2015) included the same five randomised trials
included in this review, together with a retrospective cohort and
23 case series. Those review authors concluded that the strength
of the evidence supporting frenotomy for improved breastfeed-
ing outcomes is low to insufficient and acknowledged that mater-
nal reported effect is greater. They identified gaps in the evidence
including longer-term outcomes, applicability to infants born at
non-tertiary centres, lack of consistency in diagnosis, effectiveness
of non-surgical interventions and optimal age of intervention. Two
reviews acknowledged that the optimal time of intervention is un-
known (Bowley 2014; Power 2015). Bowley 2014 recognised that
frenotomy can improve breastfeeding problems in a tongue-tied
child but advised waiting at least two weeks before performing the
procedure. All reviews concluded that the procedure appears to
have a low complication rate when performed by trained opera-
tors. Many reviews reported that available studies have method-
ological flaws and risk of bias.

Implications for practice
Frenotomy causes a short-term reduction in nipple pain among
breastfeeding mothers and an inconsistent positive effect on infant
breastfeeding. Owing to the small number of studies and the high
incidence of methodological issues, definitive benefit has not been
proven.
Implications for research
Additional high-quality randomised controlled trials are needed
to confirm whether frenotomy in tongue-tied infants causes res-
olution of feeding difficulties with both short-term and longer-
term follow-up. In such studies, frenotomy ideally should not be
performed on control infants to allow long-term assessment of the
effect of the intervention.
Other major uncertainties remain unaddressed.
• The effect of frenotomy on tongue-tied preterm infants has
yet to be studied.
• The optimal age to perform frenotomy in infants remains
unclear.
• The effect of tongue-tie on early infant weight gain and on
maternal difficulties in establishing a breast milk supply remains
to be clarified.
• It has yet to be demonstrated whether frenotomy in
breastfeeding infants with tongue-tie and feeding difficulty leads
to a longer duration of breastfeeding.
• Whether frenotomy is a painful procedure that requires
analgesia or anaesthesia has yet to be established, as no study to
date has quantified infant pain during and after frenotomy.
