Prescription Opioid Use and Satisfaction With Care 
Among Adults With Musculoskeletal Conditions
ABSTRACT
PURPOSE In the current payment paradigm, reimbursement is partially based 
on patient satisfaction scores. We sought to understand the relationship between 
prescription opioid use and satisfaction with care among adults who have muscu-
loskeletal conditions.
METHODS We performed a cross-sectional study using nationally representa-
tive data from the 2008-2014 Medical Expenditure Panel Survey. We assessed 
whether prescription opioid use is associated with satisfaction with care among 
US adults who had musculoskeletal conditions. Specifically, using 5 key domains 
of satisfaction with care, we examined the association between opioid use (over-
all and according to the number of prescriptions received) and high satisfaction, 
defined as being in the top quartile of overall satisfaction ratings.
RESULTS Among 19,566 adults with musculoskeletal conditions, we identified 
2,564 (13.1%) who were opioid users, defined as receiving 1 or more prescriptions 
in 2 six-month time periods. In analyses adjusted for sociodemographic character-
istics and health status, compared with nonusers, opioid users were more likely to 
report high satisfaction with care (odds ratio 
= 
1.32; 95% CI, 1.18-1.49). According 
to the level of use, a stronger association was noted with moderate opioid use 
(odds ratio 
= 
1.55) and heavy opioid use (odds ratio 
= 
1.43) (P <.001 for trend).
CONCLUSIONS Among patients with musculoskeletal conditions, those using 
prescription opioids are more likely to be highly satisfied with their care. Consid-
ering that emerging reimbursement models include patient satisfaction, future 
work is warranted to better understand this relationship.

INTRODUCTION
P
roviding patient-centered care is at the forefront of American health 
care reform and is assessed, in part, by patient satisfaction with 
care.1,2 Results from patient satisfaction surveys have influenced 
important quality improvement initiatives and, in the current payment par-
adigm, physicians and hospitals are partially reimbursed based on patient 
satisfaction scores.3-5 Fenton and colleagues6 found higher patient satis-
faction to be associated with greater overall health care use and, surpris-
ingly, increased mortality. Because of concerns about overtreatment and 
overdiagnosis, considerable controversy has emerged around how efforts 
to improve patient satisfaction might affect care. Incentives that encourage 
maximizing patient satisfaction could lead to unforeseen consequences.7
Against the backdrop of excessive health care use, the United States is 
facing a crisis of prescription opioid drug misuse and diversion resulting 
in epidemic levels of morbidity and mortality.7,8 According to the Centers 
for Disease Control and Prevention, use of prescription opioids has qua-
drupled since 1999; however, the amount of self-reported pain in America 
has remained unchanged.9 The National Academy of Medicine10 estimates 
there are nearly 112.5 million US adults who live with pain. Americans 
therefore regularly interact with their health care professionals seeking 
pain management expertise. There is growing concern that the combina-

tion of patient expectations and satisfaction-linked 
compensation models may influence physician opioid-
prescribing behaviors.7
The extent to which prescription opioid use is asso-
ciated with patient satisfaction is currently unknown. 
The rise in the prescription of opioids was presumably 
initially driven by a desire to improve the well-being 
of patients having pain. If, in fact, prescription opioid 
use is associated with higher patient satisfaction with 
care, such payment incentives may be perpetuating the 
prescribing of these medications. Alternatively, if pre-
scription opioid use is not associated with patient sat-
isfaction, these medications may have less of an effect 
than anticipated. It is important for policymakers, 
clinicians, and other stakeholders to have an accurate 
understanding of the potential drivers of prescribing 
in order to develop strategies designed to mitigate the 
serious public health risks. We therefore analyzed data 
from the Medical Expenditure Panel Survey (MEPS) to 
evaluate whether prescription opioid use is associated 
with higher levels of patient satisfaction among a large 
sample of US adults having musculoskeletal conditions.
METHODS
This study used only deidentified and publicly avail-
able data; thus, it was deemed exempt from institu-
tional board review by the Dartmouth College Com-
mittee for the Protection of Human Subjects (institu-
tional board review no. 00029614; June 13, 2016).
We performed a cross-sectional study to examine 
the relationship between prescription opioid use and 
satisfaction with care among adults with musculoskel-
etal conditions using data from the MEPS. The MEPS 
is a nationally representative health survey of the non-
institutionalized US population conducted annually by 
the Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality. It is 
a well-known source of national data on health service 
use, prescription medications, and health care expen-
ditures that contains both household and insurance 
components.11,12 The MEPS uses the previous year’s 
National Health Interview Survey as a sampling frame 
and applies an overlapping panel design involving 5 
rounds of interviews over a 30-month period. Tele-
phone interviews and record abstractions from health 
care professionals, hospitals, and home health caregiv-
ers as well as from pharmacies provide further use and 
expenditure data. The MEPS Household Component 
distributes questionnaires to individual household 
members and collects data on sociodemographic 
characteristics, health conditions, health status, use of 
health care services, expenditures on health services, 
access to care, satisfaction with care, and health insur-
ance coverage.11-13
Each MEPS participant is surveyed every 6 months 
for 2 years; therefore, the MEPS can be used in both 
cross-sectional and longitudinal fashion. We used the 
MEPS longitudinal data to identify a cohort of patients 
with musculoskeletal conditions and, among these indi-
viduals, identified those who used prescription opioids.
Study Population
We used longitudinal data for the years 2008 through 
2014 from all study participants in the MEPS House-
hold Component surveys who were aged 18 years 
and older and had musculoskeletal conditions. These 
survey years were chosen because they were the most 
recently available (at the time of analysis).
We identified musculoskeletal conditions using a 
combination of International Classification of Diseases, 9th 
Revision, Clinical Modification (ICD-9-CM) codes and 
patient self-reported data. Specifically, we defined indi-
viduals as having a chronic musculoskeletal condition 
if they had a self-reported diagnosis of chronic joint 
pain or arthritis, or they had a specific ICD-9-CM code 
matching a musculoskeletal condition (Supplemental 
Table 1, available at http://www.annfammed.org/con-
tent/16/1/6/suppl/DC1/). The Household Component 
survey asks participants to disclose health problems, 
including physical conditions, accidents, and injuries, 
as well as mental or emotional health conditions. These 
self-reported conditions are then mapped to ICD-9-CM 
diagnosis codes by trained MEPS researchers. The 
specific ICD-9-CM codes used to define chronic mus-
culoskeletal conditions were drawn from prior research 
and the National Arthritis Data Task Force.14,15 We 
chose this list of codes based on the likelihood that 
they define a relatively homogeneous population with 
chronic diseases that are associated with pain and dis-
ability. The MEPS joint pain question inquired whether 
the person had experienced pain, swelling, or stiffness 
around a joint in the last 12 months. We defined chronic 
joint pain as a response of “yes” to this question for both 
calendar years. The question for arthritis determined 
whether the person had received a diagnosis of arthritis 
during either calendar year. We operationally defined an 
individual as having a musculoskeletal condition if he or 
she had either an ICD-9-CM code matching those listed 
in Supplemental Table 1 or answered “yes” to the MEPS 
joint pain questions in both MEPS follow-up years. We 
excluded 4,541 adults who had a cancer diagnosis at any 
point during the 2 years of follow-up.
For the study period, there were 28,036 respon-
dents with complete data who were aged 18 years and 
older, had a musculoskeletal condition (based on the 
aforementioned criteria), and did not have cancer at 
any point during follow-up. Those with incomplete 
satisfaction data were excluded; thus, our final analytic

sample was 19,566 adults with musculoskeletal condi-
tions. We assumed, based on the scant missing data 
for various covariates and the validated nature of the 
MEPS collection process, that missing data were miss-
ing completely at random.
Study Measures
Satisfaction With Care
MEPS participants who used health care were asked 
once each year to report their satisfaction with care 
using a Consumer Assessment of Health Plans Survey 
(CAHPS). We focused on patient satisfaction with clini-
cian communication because it strongly correlates with 
the various CAHPS dimensions and with overall satis-
faction.16 The MEPS uses 4 categories of clinician behav-
iors and communication to measure patient satisfaction 
with care. Specifically, how often in the past 12 months 
did the patients’ health care professionals perform the 
following: (1) listen carefully, (2) explain things in a way 
that was easy to understand, (3) show respect for what 
they had to say, and (4) spend enough time with them. 
Additionally, we extracted a fifth item in which patients 
rated the care from their health care professional on 
an ordinal scale of 0 to 10 (from the worst to the best 
health care possible). Satisfaction with care measures 
were taken from the second calendar year of the survey 
(the time at which we identified prescription opioid use).
Prescription Opioid Use
MEPS participants are asked to report all health care 
use on study enrollment and then thereafter at regu-
lar 6-month intervals; thus, the 2 years of follow-up 
results in 5 “rounds” of data. For all adults who report 
prescription medication use, pharmacies are contacted 
to validate and augment medication use data. Trained 
MEPS coders assign a National Drug Code to pre-
scription medications reported by participants. These 
codes are then merged to classes of drugs using the 
Multum Lexicon crosswalk (Cerner Corp). We used 
the Multum drug classes for “narcotic analgesics” and 
“narcotic analgesics combinations” to identify prescrip-
tion opioid medications.
Using the longitudinal data files, we identified 
prescription opioid use in each (6-month) round of 
follow-up. To reduce classification of individuals with 
spurious opioid use as opioid users, we defined an opi-
oid user as a participant who received 1 or more opioid 
prescriptions in at least 2 of the last 3 survey rounds 
(MEPS rounds 3, 4, and 5). For example, someone who 
received a single prescription in round 3 and 1 addi-
tional prescription in round 5 would be identified as 
an opioid user. Any opioid prescribing that occurred 
in rounds 1 or 2 was considered prior opioid use; we 
explored prior opioid use as a potential covariate.
To explore a potential dose-response, we collapsed 
opioid users into 3 clinically relevant levels of use 
based on the total number of opioid prescriptions: low 
use (2 to 4 opioid prescriptions), moderate use (5 to 9), 
and heavy use (10 or more). We compared these 3 cat-
egories with respondents who were either opioid non-
users or limited users (participants having a maximum 
of 1 prescription for rounds 3, 4, and 5).
Covariates
We anticipated many other factors would predict sat-
isfaction with care and extracted data on sociodemo-
graphic characteristics, health, access to health care, 
and disability (see Table 1). We extracted data on body 
mass index and calculated the percent of adults who 
reported any limitations in physical functioning (eg, 
walking, climbing stairs, lifting, bending, standing); 
social functioning; cognitive functioning; and work 
related to pain. We also calculated the percentage of 
adults who reported any limitations at all during the 
entire year. Self-reported general health and mental 
health status was dichotomized into “good to excellent” 
vs “fair to poor.” These responses to general health sta-
tus were distinct from those on the 12-item Short Form 
Health Survey (SF-12) that we also examined (both 
physical and mental component summary scores). The 
SF-12 pain question on home and work limitations was 
dichotomized into “moderate to extremely” vs “a little 
to not at all.” We also identified adults who had inpa-
tient or outpatient surgery, or both.
Propensity Score Matching
For a sensitivity analysis, we used nearest-neighbor pro-
pensity score matching to select a sample and balance 
covariates between the 2 groups. We matched each of 
the 2,564 opioid users to 1 control opioid nonuser. Our 
propensity score model included sociodemographic char-
acteristics (age, race, education, marital status, insurance 
coverage, geographic region), self-rated health status, 
SF-12 physical and mental component summary scores, 
and body mass index. Variables for the propensity score 
model were selected using multivariate regression analy-
sis to predict the probability of being an opioid user. Of 
the 17,002 participants who met criteria for the nonuser 
group, 2,564 control individuals whose propensity scores 
matched participants in the opioid user group most 
closely were selected for inclusion in the final sample. 
Propensity score matching was performed in R (R Foun-
dation) using the optmatch package version 0.9-7.
Statistical Analysis
We combined the 5 measures of patient satisfaction 
with care into a single measure.6 To do so, we created a 
global composite satisfaction measure by standardizing 
 OPIOID USE AND SATISFACTION

(to weigh each question equally) and 
averaging responses to the 5 items (mean, 
0; median, 0.37; interquartile range, –0.68 
to 0.82). On this composite scale, lower 
scores represent less satisfaction. We then 
collapsed scores into quartiles.
We performed descriptive analyses 
to compare differences between opioid 
users and nonusers/limited users with 
regard to sociodemographic character-
istics, health care use, health status, and 
the various patient satisfaction metrics. 
We used a χ2 test for categorical vari-
ables and either a Mann-Whitney test 
or t test for continuous measures. For all 
analyses, we set the P value for statistical 
significance to .05 (2-sided). 
Logistic regression analysis was used 
to examine the relationship between 
opioid use and high satisfaction with 
care. We identified participants in the 
highest quartile of satisfaction scores 
and used this outcome (ie, being in the 
highest quartile vs all others) as our pri-
mary outcome for our logistic models. 
The relationship between opioid use and 
high satisfaction with care was examined 
overall (ie, opioid user vs nonuser/limited 
user) and by level of use (nonuser/limited 
user, low use, moderate use, high use). 
To control for confounding factors, we 
examined a broad collection of poten-
tial covariates in our statistical models 
including sociodemographic, health 
status, and health care use factors (eg, 
health insurance status, annual health 
care spending, having a usual source of 
care, and prior opioid use). We adjusted 
for age, sex, race/ethnicity, and factors 
that confounded the relationship between 
opioid use and high satisfaction with 
care; an independent variable was con-
sidered a confounder and included in the 
final model if it changed the effect esti-
mate (ie, opioid use status) by more than 
10%. Our final model was adjusted for 
age, sex, race/ethnicity, body mass index, 
self-reported health status, SF-12 physical 
and mental component summary scores, 
and level of pain (SF-12 pain question). 
To determine if the definition of non-
user (ie, a complete nonuser or a limited 
user) affected our results in any mean-
ingful way, we performed a sensitivity

analysis. In this analysis, we compared results with and 
without excluding those with any opioid use whatso-
ever in our nonuser comparison group.
RESULTS
Of the 19,566 adults with musculoskeletal conditions 
studied, 2,564 (13.1%) were prescription opioid users. 
Within this group, we categorized 29.2% as low-level 
users, 28.9% as moderate users, and 41.9% as heavy 
users. Opioid users were slightly older than nonus-
ers, but there were large differences in health status 
measures (Table 1). Compared with nonusers, users 
tended to have poorer physical and mental health. For 
instance, more than one-half of the opioid users rated 
their physical health as fair to poor, compared with 
one-fifth of nonusers (P <.001). Additionally, 75% of 
opioid users rated their pain as moderate to extreme, 
compared with only 31% of nonusers (P <.001).
Table 2 shows the unadjusted and adjusted odds 
ratios for the association between characteristics 
and high satisfaction with care. Adjusted for 
sociodemographic characteristics and health 
status, opioid use was associated with a 32% 
increase in the likelihood of being highly satis-
fied with care (ie, having a composite satisfac-
tion score in the highest quartile) (odds ratio 
[OR] = 1.32; 95% CI, 1.18-1.49). In the unad-
justed analysis, poor health status was associated 
with a reduced likelihood of being highly satis-
fied; however, this finding, was reversed in the 
adjusted analysis, with poorer health status con-
ferring an 18% increase in the likelihood of high 
satisfaction (OR = 1.18; 95% CI, 1.06-1.31).
When we stratified participants by the level 
of opioid use, the unadjusted association of use 
with satisfaction was statistically significant only 
for moderate use, whereas in the adjusted model, 
there was a strong association for both moder-
ate and heavy uses (Figure 1). Specifically, after 
adjustment for sociodemographic characteristics 
and health status, relative to nonusers/limited 
users, moderate users were 55% more likely to 
report satisfaction scores in the highest quar-
tile (OR = 1.55; 95% CI, 1.29-1.86) and heavy 
users were 43% more likely (OR = 1.43; 95% CI, 
1.20-1.70). In this model, low-level use was not 
a significant predictor. Across the 4 categories 
of increasing opioid use (none/limited, low, 
moderate, heavy), each increase in category was 
associated with a 15.0% increase in the odds 
of being in the highest quartile of satisfaction 
scores (P for test of trend <.001).
In the alternative sensitivity analysis using 
the more stringent definition of nonusers (no opioid 
prescriptions at all) as the reference category, the asso-
ciation between opioid use and high satisfaction with 
care remained unchanged.
Propensity Score Analysis
For our propensity matched analysis, we generated 
the odds ratios for the association between level of 
prescription opioid use and high satisfaction with 
care (Supplemental Table 2, available at http://www.
annfammed.org/content/16/1/6/suppl/DC1). The find-
ings were similar to those of the standard regression 
analysis, albeit attenuated. When level of opioid use 
was considered, the association between use and high 
satisfaction was statistically significant only for moder-
ate users; specifically, relative to nonusers and limited 
users, moderate users were 47% more likely to report 
satisfaction scores in the highest quartile (OR = 1.47; 
95% CI, 1.21-1.79). Low-level and heavy users did not 
differ significantly from nonusers/limited users in this

analysis. Across the 4 categories of increasing opioid 
use (none/limited, low, moderate, heavy), each increase 
in category was associated with a 6.0% increase in the 
odds of having a satisfaction score in the highest quar-
tile (P for trend <.04).
DISCUSSION
After accounting for differences among adults having 
1 or more musculoskeletal conditions, we found that 
prescription opioid use was associated with higher 
satisfaction with care. Among persistent opioid users, 
moderate and heavy use were associated with approxi-
mately 55% and 43% higher likelihoods, respectively, 
of being in the highest quartile of satisfaction scores 
compared with no or limited use. Although evidence-
based prescribing guidelines are emerging, a complex 
interaction of factors related to the patient, clinician, 
medical facts, and social conditions ultimately results in 
the decision to prescribe an opi-
oid.17 This decision is made more 
complicated by a health care 
reimbursement model that may 
favor overprescribing to optimize 
patient satisfaction through such 
mechanisms as the Hospital Con-
sumer Assessment of Healthcare 
Providers and Systems. Our find-
ings do not allow us to determine 
if overprescribing or unnecessary 
prescribing of opioids is actu-
ally occurring, but highlight the 
future need to establish whether 
the greater patient satisfaction is 
actually associated with better 
health or less disability. Opportu-
nities to reduce opioid prescribing 
without compromising quality 
of care are attractive because 
prescribed opioids constitute the 
logistical source of these medi-
cations for 70% of opioid abus-
ers.18 Current national and state 
initiatives are emerging and are 
specifically designed to decrease 
opioid prescribing by using 
patient functional improvement as 
an outcome endpoint rather than 
patient-reported measures such as 
satisfaction.19
For patients with musculo-
skeletal conditions, the asso-
ciation between opioid use and 
satisfaction may be the result of 
several factors. On a very basic level, these patients 
may have a better perceived control of pain than non-
users. Our findings indicate, however, that patients 
with musculoskeletal conditions taking opioids have 
more pain and worse health and disability than those 
taking no or limited amounts of these drugs (Table 1), 
suggesting that the situation is likely more complex. 
Additionally, in our regression model, we controlled 
for pain, thus minimizing the experience of pain as a 
driver of the satisfaction score. The lack of an associa-
tion between opioid prescribing and improvements in 
pain on a population health level has been highlighted 
by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, 
who report that since 1999, the quantity of prescrip-
tion opioids sold in the United States has almost qua-
drupled,9 yet there has not been an overall change in 
the amount of pain that Americans actually report.20,21
Our finding of a positive correlation between 
greater opioid prescribing and higher satisfaction was

surprising to us. On first pass, one could logically 
predict that opioids may be associated with reduced 
satisfaction. Beyond the highly publicized concerns 
regarding addiction and misuse, a high percentage of 
patients may experience considerable adverse effects. 
Tolerance, sedation, dizziness, nausea, vomiting, and 
respiratory depression are common in patients taking 
these medications.22 Some develop hyperalgesia, which 
can, paradoxically, worsen the pain experience.23 Addi-
tionally, patients frequently report complex opioid-
related health challenges such as sexual dysfunction, 
psychomotor disturbances, cognitive dysfunction, and 
concerns about controlling opioid use.24 We hypoth-
esize that perhaps the improved satisfaction from 
opioids may partially be explained by an analogous 
situation that has been previously documented with 
antibiotics prescribed for likely viral upper respiratory 
infections. Several studies indicate that the clinician’s 
desire to accommodate patient and parent expectations 
actually leads to overtreatment and overprescribing 
of oral antibiotics.25,26 Another possible explanation 
for our findings is that chronic opioid therapy may 
improve untreated mood disorders, which are highly 
prevalent, and the patient may perceive alleviation of 
these symptoms and report this benefit in the form of 
greater health care satisfaction.27 Only after account-
ing for differences in health status did we observe an 
association between opioid use and high satisfaction 
with care. In univariate analyses, worse health sta-
tus and self-reported pain level were associated with 
greater satisfaction with care. This pattern suggests 
that these factors must be taken into consideration 
when examining the complex relationship between 
opioid use and satisfaction with care to avoid biased 
estimates of the relationship.
In the sensitivity analysis using propensity score 
matching, we found that opioid use was associated with 
high satisfaction with care among moderate users but 
not among heavy users. Although we cannot determine 
the reason for this notable difference in satisfaction, 
a possible explanation is that heavy opioid users may 
be more likely to have uncontrolled pain or receive 
inadequate or inappropriate treatment for chronic 
pain. They may also experience more severe adverse 
effects from opioid use, including complications such 
as hyperalgesia and substance dependence. Heavy opi-
oid use may also be associated with fragmented care 
among patients who seek treatment for uncontrolled 
pain from a variety of clinicians.
There are several limitations to our study that must 
be acknowledged. First, MEPS data are generalizable 
only to noninstitutionalized Americans—trends may 
differ in other groups, such as the military population. 
Second, MEPS data are observational and based on 
self-report, and therefore subject to potential unmea-
sured confounding. In our analyses, we accounted for 
a large number of important differences, but may have 
missed some factors. Third, our data lack specific-
ity regarding opioid dose and duration of treatment. 
It is therefore possible that the absolute dosage of 
prescription opioid analgesics may be an important 
driver (negative or positive) of satisfaction. Finally, 
the poorer health and disability metrics among opioid 
users (Table 1) should be interpreted with caution. As 
our data are cross-sectional in nature, it is conceiv-
able that disability and health metrics would have 
been worse had opioid analgesics not been prescribed. 
Future prospective observational studies are required 
to more rigorously evaluate the complex relation-
ships among opioid use, patient satisfaction, physician 
behaviors, and health metrics.
In conclusion, our study suggests that patients who 
use prescription opioids for musculoskeletal conditions 
have greater satisfaction with their care. Opioid users 
report worse health and disability metrics when com-
pared with nonusers. Given the opioid-related health 
crisis in the United States, our data suggest that there 
is an urgent need to establish, on a population health 
level, whether the observed greater satisfaction with 
care is associated with demonstrable health benefits.
