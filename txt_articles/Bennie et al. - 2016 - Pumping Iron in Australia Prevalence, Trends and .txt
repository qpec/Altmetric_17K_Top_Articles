Abstract
Objective
The current Australian Physical Activity Guidelines recommend that adults engage in regu-
lar muscle-strengthening activity (e.g. strength or resistance training). However, public
health surveillance studies describing the patterns and trends of population-level muscle-
strengthening activity participation are sparse. The aim of this study is to examine the preva-
lence, trends and sociodemographic correlates of muscle-strengthening activity participa-
tion in a national-representative sample of Australians aged 15 years and over.
Methods
Between 2001 and 2010, quarterly cross-sectional national telephone surveys were con-
ducted as part of the Australian Sports Commission's 'Exercise, Recreation and Sport Sur-
vey'. Pooled population-weighted proportions were calculated for reporting: [i] no muscle-
strengthening activity; [ii] insufficient muscle-strengthening activity, and [iii] sufficient mus-
cle-strengthening activity. Associations with sociodemographic variables were assessed
using multiple logistic regression analyses.
Results
Out of 195,926 participants, aged 15–98 years, only 10.4% (95% CI: 10.1–10.7) and 9.3%
(95% CI: 9.1–9.5) met the muscle-strengthening activity recommendations in the past two
weeks and in the past year, respectively. Older adults (50+ years), and those living in socio-
economically disadvantaged, outer regional/remote areas and with lower education were
less likely to report sufficient muscle-strengthening activity (p<0.001). Over the 10-year
monitoring period, there was a significant increase in the prevalence of sufficient muscle-
strengthening activity (6.4% to 12.0%, p-value for linear trend <0.001).

 Conclusions
A vast majority of Australian adults did not engage in sufficient muscle-strengthening activ-
ity. There is a need for public health strategies to support participation in muscle-strengthen-
ing activity in this population. Such strategies should target older and lower educated
adults, and those living in socioeconomically disadvantaged, outer regional/remote and
areas.
Introduction
The prevention of chronic diseases, such as cardiovascular disease, diabetes, breast and colon
cancer is a leading Australian [1], and global public health challenge [2]. Insufficient physical
activity is among the leading and potentially preventable causes of chronic disease [3]. For
chronic disease prevention, the Australian Department of Health and the World Health Orga-
nization recommend that adults should participate in [i] �150 minutes/week of moderate-to-
vigorous-intensity aerobic activity (e.g. brisk walking or jogging) and, [ii] muscle-strengthen-
ing activities involving major muscle groups on two or more days per week [3, 4].
The 2014 Physical Activity and Sedentary Behaviour Guidelines were the first Australian
national guidelines to recommend muscle-strengthening activities for adults and older adults
[4]. Muscle-strengthening activities are performed with the primary purpose of increasing
muscle strength or tone [5], and include activities such as lifting weights (e.g. barbells or dumb-
bells), and using resistance bands or body weight (e.g. push-ups, sit-ups) [6]. Exercise trials and
epidemiological studies have shown that muscle-strengthening activities are associated with
multiple favourable health outcomes, including improved metabolic [7–9], musculoskeletal,
functional and mental health-related outcomes [10], improved blood lipid profile [11], and
reduced blood pressure [12].
Despite these health benefits, few studies have reported the prevalence and correlates of
muscle-strengthening activity participation [6]. Previous studies from US [13–15], Australia
[16–18] and Japan [19] suggest a wide range of participation rates, with between 4% and 32%
of adults (aged 18 years and over) meeting the muscle-strengthening activity recommendations
of at least 2 sessions/week. While little is known about the sociodemographic correlates of par-
ticipation in muscle-strengthening activity, there is some evidence that males, younger adults
(18–24 years) and those with higher education levels are more likely to meet the recommenda-
tions [6]. Developing an understanding of the prevalence and correlates of muscle-strengthen-
ing activities is vital for orientating public health approaches to promote this essential
component of physical activity-related health [6]. However, at present, only one study has
examined the patterns and sociodemographic correlates of muscle-strengthening activity
among a representative population-based sample of Australians [16], and none have examined
its time trends.,.
The aim of this study was, therefore, to examine the prevalence, trends and sociodemo-
graphic correlates of muscle-strengthening activity among a large national-representative sam-
ple of Australians aged 15 years and over.
Materials and Methods
Sample
Data were used from the Australian Sports Commission’s ‘Exercise, Recreation and Sport Sur-
vey (ERASS)’ [20]. The ERASS entailed a series of yearly independent cross-sectional national
surveys conducted between 2001 and 2010, with the aim of collecting information on the

 frequency, duration, and type of activities Australians participated in for exercise, recreation or
sport [20]. The applicability of ERASS for use in public health surveillance has been established
previously [21]. During 2001–10, quarterly survey samples were randomly selected from com-
munity-dwelling persons aged 15 years and over. Data were collected using a computer-assis-
ted telephone interview (CATI) system with households being sampled from the Electronic
White Pages (2001–2006) or by Random Digit Dialling technique (2007–2010) [20]. Data col-
lection was commissioned by Australian Sports Commission to be carried out by an external
market research company [20]. Upon being contacted by telephone, participants were provided
with an an explanation of the purpose of the ERRAS via the use of a standardised text. Partici-
pants were explained that verbal consent was considered if they agreed to then take part in the
telephone interview. Given the nature of the study, written consent was considered not practi-
cal. The market research company responsible for data collection recorded participant consent
using a standardised data collection form. All study materials were securely stored by the com-
pany. At the commencement of each data collection period the Australian Sports Commission
were provided with all data collection forms accrued during the study. Ethical approval for all
procedures implemented in the ERRAS was obtained from Federation University Australia
Ethics Committee. Response rates were 49.0%, 48.0%, 45.3%, 41.0%, 34.0%, 42.0%, 31.4%,
25.7%, 25.2% and 23.1%, from 2001 through 2010 respectively [20]. More details on ERASS
methods can be found elsewhere [22, 23].
ERASS questionnaire
The ERASS 2001–10 questionnaire asked respondents about participation in leisure-time phys-
ical activity, defined as; ‘any physical activity done for exercise, recreation or sport in the past 12
months’. Respondents were asked to exclude ‘any physical activity associated with work, house-
hold or garden chores’. Those who indicated participation were asked to list the types of leisure-
time physical activity undertaken, whether each activity was organised or non-organised, and
the number of times they participated in each activity during the previous 12 months. From
2005 onwards, participants were also asked about the frequency and average session duration
in the past two weeks. In the current study, we used data from the 12-month (2001–10) and
2-week recall periods (2005–10).
During ERASS data collection, respondents reported 187 different types of leisure-time
physical activities that were initially collapsed into 170 categories [20]. In the current study, we
considered leisure-time physical activities that are theoretically related to muscle-strengthening
and were either organised or non-organised. A total of nine leisure-time physical activities
were classified as primarily muscle-strengthening activities: (i) ‘Calisthenics’; (ii) ‘Gymnasium
workouts’; (iii) ‘Military exercise’; (iv) ‘Prime movers (over 50s)’; (v) ‘Body building’; (vi) ‘Cir-
cuits’; (vii) ‘Power team’; (viii) ‘Weight training for fitness’; and (ix) ‘Weightlifting (competi-
tion)’. Responses from these activities were collapsed to create the overall muscle-
strengthening activity variable. Similar questions on muscle-strengthening activities have been
shown to have acceptable reliability [24], and have been used in previous Australian studies
[17, 25].
Classification of muscle-strengthening activity levels
Muscle-strengthening activity data from the 12-month recall were categorised as: [i] ‘no mus-
cle-strengthening activity’ (0 sessions), [ii] ‘insufficient muscle-strengthening activity’ (1–103
sessions), and [iii] ‘sufficient muscle-strengthening activity’ (�104 sessions). Data from the
2-week recall were classified as: [i] ‘no muscle-strengthening activity’ (0 sessions), [ii] ‘insuffi-
cient muscle-strengthening activity’ (1–3 sessions), and [iii] ‘sufficient muscle-strengthening

3 / 15
 activity’ (�4 sessions). The ‘sufficient muscle-strengthening activity’ group (�4 sessions) was
further dichotomised according to the total duration of muscle-strengthening activities in the
past two weeks into: [i] ‘sufficient frequency of muscle-strengthening activity’ (�4 sessions and
<80 minutes), and [ii] sufficient frequency and duration of muscle-strengthening activity (�4
sessions and �80 minutes). The Australian Physical Activity Guidelines do not specify the rec-
ommended duration of muscle-strengthening activities; hence the cut-off point of 80 minutes
in the past two weeks was used in accordance with a previous Australian study [18]. The dura-
tion was taken into account only for 2-week recalls, because no such data were available for
12-month recalls.
Sociodemographic variables
Sociodemographic variables (gender, age, level of education) were assessed using standard
questions [20], and sub-categories were created consistent with previous studies reporting on
the ERASS (Table 1) [22, 26]. Participants’ state and postcode, were used to describe the distri-
bution of the sample by Australian states and territories, area of residence [27] and regional
socioeconomic status using the Australian Bureau of Statistics (ABS) ‘Index of Relative Socio-
Economic Advantage and Disadvantage’ (IRSAD) [28]. IRSAD scores were grouped as quin-
tiles, with ‘1’ for the most disadvantaged and ‘5’ for the least disadvantaged [28].
Statistical analysis
Analyses were conducted using the Complex Samples module of SPSS version 22 (SPSS Inc. an
IBM Company, Chicago, IL). All data were weighted by state, region (metropolitan or rest of
the state), age group, gender and year to allow for valid population estimates. The weights were
based on Australian Bureau of Statistics (ABS) projections for persons in Occupied Private
Dwellings [20]. Pooled prevalence levels and their 95% confidence intervals (95% CI) were cal-
culated for the 12-month recall (2001–10) and for the 2-week recall (2005–10). The prevalence
rates and their 95% CIs were also calculated for each year separately, and reported for the total
sample and by sociodemographic characteristics. Trends in the prevalence rates over time were
examined using linear regression analysis. Differences between the prevalence rates across
sociodemographic characteristics were tested using the chi-square test.
Two separate multiple logistic regression analyses were used to assess the odds of being clas-
sified as doing ‘sufficient muscle-strengthening activity in the past 12 months (yes/no)’ or ‘suf-
ficient muscle-strengthening activity in the past 2 weeks (yes/no)’. Each model included the
following explanatory variables: gender (reference group [ref] = “male”); age (ref = “15–29
years”); education level (ref = “high”); IRSAD (ref = “1st [most disadvantaged]”); State or terri-
tory (ref = “New South Wales”) and Area of residence (ref = “metropolitan”). To adjust for
yearly variations, year of study was included as a covariate. Adjusted odds ratios and their 95%
CIs were reported. Where suitable, the odds ratios were tested for heterogeneity and linear
trend using Wald chi-square test and polynomial contrasts method, respectively. A p-value of
<0.05 was used to indicate statistical significance.
Results
The sample sociodemographic characteristics for each year (2001–10) and the pooled weighted
data are shown in Table 1. Overall, data were available from 195,926 survey participants (mean
yearly sample size = 19,592, range: 15,477–23,226). In the pooled weighted 2001–10 sample,
50.6% were female, 37.1% were aged 50+ years, 68.4% were high school or university educated,
42.2% were in two least disadvantaged IRSAD quintiles, 77.5% were from New South Wales,
Victoria or Queensland, and 68.4% were from Metropolitan areas (Table 1).

 The weighted responses for muscle-strengthening activity levels of the pooled ERASS 2001–
10 samples are shown in Fig 1. For the 12-month recall (2001–10), 84.6% (95% CI: 84.4–84.9),
6.1% (95% CI: 5.9–6.2), and 9.3% (95% CI: 9.1–9.5) reported no, insufficient and sufficient
muscle-strengthening activity, respectively. For the 2-week recall (2005–10), 84.9% (95% CI:
84.6–85.3), 4.7% (95% CI: 4.4–4.9), 10.4% (95% CI: 10.1–10.7) reported no, insufficient fre-
quency of muscle-strengthening activity and sufficient frequency of muscle-strengthening
activity, respectively (Fig 1). Almost all (99.9%) of those reporting sufficient frequency of mus-
cle-strengthening activity also reported sufficient duration (Fig 1).
The trends in the prevalence of sufficient muscle-strengthening activity by sociodemo-
graphic categories for the 12-month (2001–10), and 2-week recall periods (2005–10) are pre-
sented in Tables 2 and 3, respectively. For the total sample, the weighted proportions of those

 reporting sufficient muscle-strengthening activity showed a significant linear trend over time
(p <0.001). The prevalence rates based on 12-month and 2-week recalls increased from 6.4%
in 2001 to 12.0% in 2010 and from 9.0% in 2005 to 10.4% in 2010, respectively. Significant lin-
ear trends were observed across all sociodemographic categories for the 12-month recall period
(2001–10) (p <0.001 for almost all comparisons), and across most sociodemographic catego-
ries for the 2-week recall period (p <0.05).
Table 4 shows the results of the multiple logistic regression analyses. For most sociodemo-
graphic categories, the adjusted odds ratios of reporting sufficient muscle-strengthening activ-
ity were largely concordant for both recall periods. When compared to reference groups, older
adults (p <0.001) those with lower education (p <0.001) and those living in non-metropolitan
areas (p<0.001) were significantly less likely to report sufficient muscle-strengthening activity.
The odds of sufficient muscle-strengthening activity increased with higher socioeconomic sta-
tus (p-value for trend <0.001 for both recall periods). In addition, females were somewhat
more likely than males to report sufficient muscle-strengthening activity in the past 12 months,
but not in the past 2 weeks (Table 4).
Discussion
The key finding is that around 90% of Australians do not meet the global and national muscle-
strengthening activity recommendations. Given the multiple health benefits associated with
participation in sufficient muscle-strengthening activity [10], these findings are of a public
health concern. A further key outcome was the approximate two-fold increase in muscle-
strengthening activity levels during the ERRAS 2001–10 monitoring period.

 Previous smaller Australian studies have estimated that 9.4%-18.6% met the muscle-
strengthening activity recommendations [16–18], compared to ~10% in the current study. The
differences in prevalence estimates may be due to different sample sizes and survey methodolo-
gies. The ERASS reported on muscle-strengthening activity in the past 12-months and
2-weeks, whereas other two studies reported past-week recalls only [17, 18]. Moreover, slight
discrepancies in questionnaire items wording may have added to the magnitude of the differ-
ences between prevalence rates. This underscores the importance of using standardised instru-
ments in public health surveillance of muscle-strengthening activity. Interestingly, the
12-month and 2-week recall periods produced comparable estimates in the current study.
A potential positive finding is that muscle-strengthening activity levels significantly
increased between 2001–10. Since the ERASS study period did not coincide with 2014 Austra-
lia's Physical Activity Guidelines, which where the first national guidelines to recommend mus-
cle-strengthening activity, it is unlikely that public health campaigns were responsible. A
possible explanation may be the increase in the number of privatized gym facilities in Australia
over the last decade [29], hence, potentially providing better access to muscle-strengthening
equipment. In addition, there are some data to suggest that more people are transitioning out
of organised sport and into less-organised activities [30]. Regardless of these trends, it should
be reiterated that even in 2010 as much as 88% of the sample did not report sufficient participa-
tion in muscle-strengthening activity.
The sociodemographic correlates of muscle-strengthening activity in the current study are
largely consistent with previous research [6]. Both internationally [6] and within Australia
[16], previous studies have shown that older adults, those with lower education levels and
socioeconomically disadvantaged individuals are less likely to report sufficient muscle-
strengthening activity. Our findings support targeting these groups in strategies to increase
muscle-strengthening activity levels. Also, it might be possible that encouraging muscle-
strengthening activity participation among younger populations may result in higher participa-
tion across the lifespan. In the current study, females were more likely than males to report suf-
ficient muscle-strengthening activity in the last 12 months, but not when a 2-week recall was
used. Further research is needed to examine the causes of this difference between two recall
periods. Nevertheless, a previous Australian study has found slightly higher participation rate
among females, however, due to a smaller sample size the difference did not reach the level of
statistical significance [25]. It may be that in future Australian interventions to increase mus-
cle-strengthening activity participation more focus should be placed on older males.
When compared to the proportions of Australian adults meeting the moderate-to-vigorous-
intensity aerobic activity guidelines [31], fewer the Australian adults meet the muscle-strength-
ening activity guidelines (~50% vs. ~10%). In fact, the present study suggests that a large
majority of Australians that did not meet the muscle-strengthening activity recommendations,
are most likely not attaining the numerous health benefits associated with this activity [10].
Our findings call for public health strategies to encourage increasing participation in mus-
cle-strengthening activity [32]. At the macro-level, it is incumbent upon governments to pro-
vide supportive policy and physical environments. Strategies could include the provision of
affordable and accessible community-based facilities (e.g. gyms/health clubs) and the subsidis-
ing of equipment (e.g. resistance bands, dumbbells). Supporting these strategies is emerging
evidence from cross-sectional studies in Japan suggesting that key correlates of muscle-
strengthening activity participation include perceived access to facilities and the existence of
equipment at home [33, 34].
This study has several limitations. First, the ambiguous ERASS coding for some activities,
such as ‘gymnasium workouts’, may have captured non-muscle-strengthening-related activities
(e.g. aerobic, flexibility training), potentially resulting in an overestimation of muscle-

 strengthening activity levels. Since only leisure-time physical activity was assessed, a further
limitation was that any muscle strengthening-related activities that occurred within the occu-
pational and household domains were not reported (e.g. farming, labouring, gardening etc.).
However, given recent technological and societal advancements [35], we believe it is unlikely
that many accrue sufficient muscle-strengthening activity within these domains. A further lim-
itation was the fact that the sample included respondents aged 15–18 years. It is likely that such
respondents may not have completed their full education, and therefore be classified as having
low or medium education levels. Therefore, our findings from unadjusted analyses around the
prevalence of muscle-strengthening activity by education level should be viewed with caution.
Last, previous studies reporting ERASS data have shown an under-representation of non-
English speaking respondents, and therefore results may be less generalizable to non-native
speakers [23]. Strengths of this study include the use of large broadly representative national
sample [22], and the assessment of muscle-strengthening activity levels over multiple years and
across several sociodemographic categories. A further strength was that both the 12-month
recall and 2-week recall yielded similar results. This supports the robustness of our finding.
Conclusion
Between 2001 and 2010 a vast majority of Australians reported no or insufficient participation
in muscle-strengthening activity. Given the considerable health benefits associated with partici-
pation in this type of physical activity, these findings should prompt public health agencies to
formulate comprehensive approaches to support population-level muscle-strengthening activ-
ity participation. At risk population sub-groups include older adults, those living in socioeco-
nomically disadvantaged and non-metropolitan areas, and those with low education levels.
