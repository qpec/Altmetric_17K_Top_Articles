Abstract 
 
Objective: Partly inconsistent findings from previous reviews have fueled discussions on the 
impact of sugar-sweetened beverages (SSBs) on obesity development. The aim was to sys-
tematically review the recent evidence in children and adults.  
Methods: Data were retrieved 
from the databases MEDLINE, EMBASE, and Cochrane library for the period January 2013 to 
October 2015. A systematic review of prospective cohort studies and randomized controlled 
trials (RCTs) relating SSBs to weight measures was conducted.  
Results: 30 publications met 
the inclusion criteria. Prospective cohort studies (96%; n = 26) showed a positive association 
between consumption of SSBs and weight/BMI in adults and children (n = 242,352), and only 
one cohort study in children showed no association. Findings from three RCTs in children 
demonstrated that SSB consumption had an effect on BMI/BMI z-score. The one RCT in adults 
showed no significant effect of the intervention. 63% of the studies were of good, 30% of me-
dium quality, and none was funded by industry.  
Conclusion: Recent evidence suggests that 
SSB consumption is positively associated with or has an effect on obesity indices in children

public health policies should aim to reduce the consumption of SSBs and encourage healthy 
alternatives such as water.

Introduction 
 
Over the last decades the prevalence of overweight and obesity across Europe and all 
over the world has been rising, also in young children. From 1975 to 2014, the worldwide 
prevalence of overweight and obesity increased from 23% to 39% in females and from 21% 
to 38% in males  
[1] 
. According to the 2013 United Nations Children’s Fund (UNICEF), World 
Health Organization (WHO) and World Bank estimates, between 2000 and 2013 the number 
of overweight children worldwide increased from 32 million to 42 million. Meanwhile, the 
intake of sugar-sweetened beverages (SSBs) has also increased worldwide  
[2, 3] 
. As they are 
sweetened with various forms of sugars, SSBs add calories (mean 114 kcal/day; NHANES 
2005–2008; American children, adolescents, and adults) to the normal diet  
[4] 
 and are the 
largest contributor to added sugars  
[5] 
. Moreover, there is heavy marketing worldwide, also 
in low- and middle-income countries, and sales of SSBs are rising  
[6] 
. A data analysis from 
nationally or sub-nationally representative dietary surveys showed a global increase in SSB 
intake from 1990 to 2010. The authors found a strong correlation between BMI and SSB 
consumption, especially in adults below 40 years  
[7] 
. 
 
 
There is some evidence that the consumption of SSBs is positively associated with body 
weight measures in both children and adults  
[8] 
 and is also linked to an increased risk of type 
2 diabetes  
[9, 10] 
. Moreover, by using data from national dietary surveys worldwide, a 
modelling study estimated 184,000 deaths per year to be attributable to the consumption of 
SSBs, of which 133,000 came from diabetes mellitus, 45,000 from cardiovascular disease, and 
6,450 from cancers. Furthermore, 5% of SSB-related deaths arose in low-income, 71% in 
middle-income, and 24% in high-income countries  
[11] 
. 
 
 
Moreover, two meta-analyses from 2013 showed that there is a positive association 
between SSB consumption and weight gain  
[8, 12] 
. However, two systematic reviews have 
shown that in studies funded by the sugar and beverages industries the link between caloric 
sweeteners and weight gain was weak  
[13, 14] 
. A more recent systematic literature review 
concluded that there was a direct association between SSB consumption and weight gain, 
overweight, and obesity in children and adolescents  
[15] 
. Another systematic analysis showed 
that inconsistent findings might be due to methodological bias in original studies and in 
reviews  
[16] 
. Consequently, conflicting results from previous reviews have fueled debates on 
the effect of SSBs on the development of obesity. 
 
 
The latest published systematic review and meta-analysis examining the association 
between SSBs and body weight gain was published in 2013 and included studies from 1990 
to 2012. Up to now, no systemic review considered studies from 2013 to 2015. However, for 
policymakers and also clinicians making evidence-based recommendations about SSBs, a 
systematic approach based on up-to-date data regarding the available evidence is required. 
Therefore, the aim of this study was to systematically review the recent studies in children 
and adults in order to add consolidating evidence to that already published.

Material and Methods 
 
Search Strategy 
 
We identified relevant articles published between January 2013 and October 2015, which evaluated the 
association between SSBs and body weight measures in children and adults, by searching the following data-
bases: MEDLINE (PubMed:  
www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed 
), EMBASE ( 
www.ovid.com 
), and the Cochrane 
library ( 
www.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/cochranelibrary 
). The search strategy combined numerous terms 
relative to SSBs (e.g. sweetened beverages, soft drinks, carbonated beverages, sports drinks, fruit drinks), 
body weight (e.g. BMI, body weight, body fat, obesity), cardiometabolic outcomes (e.g. cardiovascular 
diseases, diabetes mellitus, hyperlipidemia, hypertension), and study design or epidemiologic methods (e.g. 
cohorts, clinical trials, randomized). The terms of Medical Subject Headings (MeSH) and equivalent key 
words in titles and abstracts were used. We included terms for cardiometabolic outcomes as these types of 
studies might also contain body weight outcomes. The present systematic review focuses on outcomes which 
are related to body weight measures, e.g. BMI, BMI Z-score, body weight, body fat, waist circumference, 
weight-for-height z-score, or waist-to-hip ratio. PRISMA guidelines were followed  
[17] 
. The search strategy 
was defined by all investigators.
 
 
Study Selection 
 
Studies were included in the systematic review if they met the following criteria: i) prospective cohort 
study or randomized controlled trial (RCT) as study design; ii) original research as publication type; iii) 
reported SSB intake as exposure and body weight measures, e.g. BMI, BMI Z-scores, waist circumference, 
body fat mass, or body weight as outcome variable; and iv) studies conducted in children and adults. SSBs 
were defined as any SSBs including sodas/soft drinks, fruit juice drinks, syrup-based drinks, flavored water 
with sugar, and sports drinks. The selection of papers was restricted to those published in either English or 
German. A study duration of above 6 months was a further inclusion criterion for prospective cohort studies 
and RCTs to guarantee that appropriate time was provided for the evaluation of the association between SSB 
intake and body weight change. Of the identified studies, titles and abstracts were screened for the above 
mentioned criteria, and potentially relevant papers were selected for full-text review. This work was 
performed independently by two investigators (ML and EW). 
 
 
Risk of Bias and Study Quality Assessment 
 
For cohort studies, the Newcastle Ottawa Scale was used for risk of bias assessment  
[18] 
. This scale 
assesses three areas: i) selection with the representativeness of the exposed cohort, the selection of the non-
exposed cohort, the ascertainment of exposure, and the demonstration that outcome of interest was not 
present at the start of the study; ii) comparability of cohorts on the basis of the design or analysis; and iii) 
outcome with the assessment of it, the duration of the follow-up for outcomes to occur (1 year), and the 
adequacy of the follow-up of cohorts (<20%). The maximum score is 9 points (or stars)  
[18] 
. Prospective 
cohort studies with a score  
≥ 
7 points were considered as good,  
≥ 
5 as medium, and  
≤ 
4 as poor quality. The 
RCTs were reviewed using the Jadad scale  
[19] 
, which also includes three domains: i) randomization with the 
necessity of mentioning and the appropriate use of the method; ii) blinding with the necessity of mentioning 
and the appropriate use of the method; and iii) an account of all patients, meaning that the fate of all patients 
in the trial should be known or, if not, the reason should be stated. The maximum score is 5 points  
[19] 
. RCTs 
with a score  
≥ 
4 points were considered as good, of 3 points as medium, and  
≤ 
2 as poor quality. The risk of 
bias and study quality assessment was performed independently by two investigators (ML and EW). 
 
Results 
 
Literature Search 
 
The literature search identified a total of 1,612 citations of which 48 were selected for 
full-text review by screening the titles and abstracts. After the full-text review, 18 articles 
were additionally excluded from the review. Thus, 30 articles were eligible for review. Of 
these, 17 and 3 are prospective cohort studies and RCTs in children respectively; the remaining 
studies investigated adults ( 9 prospective cohort studies, 1 RCT ( 
fig. 1 
).

Characteristics of Included Studies 
 
The characteristics of all included studies are shown in  
tables 1–3 
. In total, 244,651 study 
participants were included in this systematic review. 10 of the included studies were published 
in 2013, another 10 in 2014, and also 10 studies in 2015. Regarding the geographical area of 
the studies included, 33% were done in Europe, 23% in the US, 17% in Middle or South 
America, 10% in Australia, 7% in South Africa, and the remaining 10% in Iran, Thailand and 
Japan. 
 
 
Prospective Cohort Studies in Children 
 
We identified 17 prospective cohort studies in children including 56,340 children. The 
mean age was 9 years, the study duration 0.5–13 years, and 94% of studies measured body 
weight outcome variables. The SSB consumption was assessed by applying the following 
dietary assessment methods: 47% of studies used food frequency questionnaires (FFQs) 
whereby half of them were validated, 23% interviews, 24% 24-hour recalls, and 6% dietary 
records. Regarding adjustment for covariates, 47% of these prospective cohort studies 
adjusted for physical activity, and 47% also adjusted for dietary energy intake. Regarding

underreporting, 6 out of 17 studies assessed underreporting. In 2 studies under-reporters 
were included in the analysis but with adjustment for underreporting, and in 4 studies under-
reporters were excluded. Five studies used BMI as body weight outcome

, 5 BMI

, 3 body fat  
[30–32]

[36] 
 ( 
table 1 
). Almost all (94%) of the articles showed a positive association between 
SSB intake and body weight measures, meaning that a higher SSB consumption lead to a 
higher degree of adiposity. One prospective cohort study in children showed no consistent 
trends in body fat associated with intakes of SSBs (the remaining 6%)  
[31] 
.
 
 
Prospective Cohort Studies in Adults 
 
Nine prospective cohort studies were identified in adults including 186,012 participants. 
The mean age was 46 years, the study duration was 5–14 years, and 44% of the studies 
measured body weight outcome variables. SSB consumption was assessed with the following 
dietary assessment methods: 44% used FFQs and 56% interviews. Regarding adjustment for 
covariates, 33% of these prospective cohort studies adjusted results for physical activity, and 
56% also adjusted for dietary energy intake. Three studies used BMI as a body weight outcome 
 
[37–39] 
, three weight  
[40–42] 
, and three waist circumference  
[43–45] 
 ( 
table 2 
). All articles 
showed a positive association between SSB intake and body weight measures, meaning that 
a higher SSB consumption lead to a higher body weight in adults.
 
 
RCTs in Children 
 
Three RCTs were identified in children including 2,059 participants. The mean age was 
9 years, the study duration was on average 1 year, and body weight outcome variables were 
measured in all studies. The interventions consisted of two nutritional education programs 
at school (n = 2)  
[46, 47] 
 and one healthy lifestyle education program  
[48] 
. The two school-
based studies included a control group in the study design  
[46, 47] 
 ( 
table 3 
). To assess SSB 
intake, two trials used dietary records, and one used FFQs as dietary assessment methods. 
Two out of these three trials adjusted for physical activity  
[46, 48] 
, but no study adjusted for 
dietary energy intake. Two studies used BMI as the obesity measure  
[46, 47] 
, and one study 
used BMI Z-score  
[48] 
. The study of Zheng et al.  
[48] 
 is a secondary analysis of an RCT, analyzed 
as a cohort, including a healthy lifestyle education and demonstrated that every 100 g/day 
increase in SBB intake was associated with a 100 g and 0.06 U increases in body weight (p = 
0.048) and BMI Z-score (p = 0.04), respectively. The other secondary analysis of an RCT  
[46] 
 
which consisted of a school-based education program showed positive associations between 
the frequency of consumption of soda and the change in BMI when adjusted for age and sex. 
Each increase in soda intake (1 glass/day) was associated with a BMI increase of 0.11 (95% 
CI 0.03–0.25) kg/m 
2 
. The paired-cluster randomized trial by Cunha et al.  
[47] 
 which comprised 
a school-based education program revealed a statistically significant change in BMI over time 
(variable time × intervention; p  =  0.02), indicating an increase in BMI in the intervention 
compared to control group, when model includes baseline variables. Modeling without 
adjustment for baseline showed no association. The included RCTs in children demonstrated 
that SSB consumption had an impact on BMI or BMI Z-score ( 
table 3 
). 
 
 
RCT in Adults 
 
One RCT with 240 participants was identified in adults  
[49] 
. The mean age was 33 years, 
the study duration was 0.75 years, and weight and height were measured. The intervention 
group (WEP) was provided with water along with nutrition counseling, including individu-
alized and group meetings targeted to the rationale and strategies to increase water intake, 
reduce SSB intake, and substitute water for SSBs. The control group (EP) received education 
provision only ( 
table 3 
). This study used 24-hour recall for assessing SSB intake and BMI as

the obesity measure. The authors of this study did not adjust for physical activity or for dietary 
energy intake. This RCT in adults demonstrated that the water plus education provision inter-
vention resulted in a greater reduction in BMI at 3 months (change from baseline) (–0.4 ± 0.08 
kg/m 
2 
) compared to the education-only group (–0.2 ± 0.08 kg/m 
2 
; p = 0.07)  
[49] 
, but this 
difference was not statistically significant. Women in both groups lost weight, with no 
difference between groups (p interaction = 0.40). By the end of the intervention (9 months), 
the mean weight loss was 21.2 ± 0.4 kg in the WEP group and 20.8 ± 0.4 kg in the EP group 
(p = 0.40) ( 
table 3 
).
 
 
SSBs and Obesity Measures 
 
The association between SSB consumption and body weight measures was positive in 
96% of prospective cohort studies in children and adults including 242,352 participants. The 
remaining 4% (one study in children) showed no association, and no study showed an inverse 
or negative association. 
 
 
All three RCTs in 2,059 children showed that reduced SSB consumption significantly 
lowered BMI or BMI Z-score. Taken together, 93% of all 30 studies, including 244,651 partic-
ipants, showed that SSB consumption contributed to increased indices of obesity (body 
weight or BMI or BMI z-score) in children and adults. 
 
 
Study Quality 
 
The quality and risk of bias assessment of the included studies is summarized in  
table 4 
. 
The mean score of prospective cohort studies in children is 6.7 ± 1.4 and in adults 6.8 ± 1.1 
points; 73% are of good, 19% of medium, and the remaining 8% of the studies are of poor 
quality. For RCTs, the score in children is 3.0 ± 0.0 and in the unique trial in adults 3.0 points. 
Consequently, all trials showed a medium study quality. In total, 63% of the included studies 
demonstrated a good quality and 30% a medium one.
 
 
Funding and Conflicts of Interest 
 
The majority of the studies were funded by national institutions (40%) and another 40% 
by national and academic organizations, 13% received no funding and 7% of them an academic 
funding. Furthermore, no study was funded by industry. Regarding the conflicts of interest of 
authors in studies, 90% had no conflict of interest, 7% provided no detail, and in one study 
one author received an industrial grant.
 
Discussion 
 
Findings from this systematic review of prospective cohort studies and intervention 
trials showed an overall positive association between the consumption of SSBs and indices of 
obesity in both children and adults. Almost all (93%) of the 30 included studies in children 
and adults revealed a positive association, and only one prospective cohort study in children 
showed no association; the RCT in adults demonstrated no effect of the intervention.
 
 
The annual weight gain during childhood depends on age, pubertal stage and growth 
rate, and, therefore, authors used BMI or BMI Z-score as the main outcome in the majority of 
studies. The current evidence including 17 prospective cohort studies in children and adoles-
cents showed that higher intake of SSBs was associated with increased body weight measures 
(BMI or BMI Z-score). Only one study  
[31] 
 found no association between SSB intake and 
percent body fat measured by dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry. The explanation of the 
authors was that children in this study had lower intakes of SSBs than those observed in other 
studies, and, therefore, it is very possible that there is no association with excess body fat  
[31] 
.

This prospective cohort study included about 100 children with a mean age of 4 years and 
used food records with the Food Guide Pyramid as the dietary assessment method. On the 
contrary, the study by Laverty et al.  
[32] 
 also used percent body fat (by bioelectrical impedance 
analysis) as an outcome measure but observed a positive association with SBBs. They included 
approximately 13,000 children with a mean age of 9 years and used caregiver reporting as 
the dietary assessment method. 
 
 
On the opposite to children, weight gain in adults is a gradual process as it occurs over 
decades and is estimated to be approximately half a kilogram per year  
[50] 
. The 9 prospective 
cohort studies in adults showed a positive association between SSB consumption and body 
weight, BMI, or waist circumference. Therefore, reducing or eliminating SSBs from the daily 
diet might be an effective approach to avoid age-related body weight gain.

Results from RCTs support those from prospective cohort studies. Since 2013, the four 
trials identified used education programs as interventions to reduce or discourage the intake 
of SSBs in children and adults  
[46–48] 
. Regarding the study design, two publications in 
children included secondary analysis of an RCT  
[46, 48] 
, and one article with a paired cluster 
randomized design  
[47] 
 demonstrated that an increase in SBBs or fruit juice intake was asso-
ciated with a BMI increase. The unique trial in adults used an RCT design, and the women in 
both groups lost weight, with no statistically significant difference between groups  
[49] 
. 
However, there was a greater BMI reduction after 3 months in the intervention group (p = 
0.07). According to the authors, both groups decreased SSB intake, resulting in a great 
proportion of the control group having an SSB intake similar to the intervention group and 
total energy intake did not differ between groups because of the trend of decreased energy 
intake from solid foods among women in the control group. In addition, due to the nutrition 
counseling it is possible that women in the control group were motivated by joining this 
weightloss study and decided to modify some behaviors that are related to a healthier life-
style. Another potential limitation of this study is misreporting as underreporting increased 
from 11% at baseline to 42% by the end of the intervention. In addition to the misreporting 
expected in a weight loss trial, in this study the underreporting of SSB consumption might 
be higher in the intervention group as the intervention discouraged SSB consumption  
[49] 
. 
After the school-based education program  
[47] 
 or the water and education provision  
[49] 
 
SSB intake was reduced. A recent study modeled the effect of replacing one serving of SSB 
( 
∼ 
0.25 l) with one serving of water and estimated a decrease of energy intake from beverages 
from 17 to 11%. Authors also predicted a reduction in the prevalence of obesity and an 
increase in the prevalence of normal weight  
[51] 
, similar to those results found in the SUN 
cohort  
[52] 
.
 
 
In summary, this systematic review shows that the evidence between 2013 and 2015 
concerning education interventions to change SBB intake is limited, and it is difficult to date 
to draw a causal relationship. Only two trials in children adjusted for physical activity. Results 
may also have been affected by the intensity of intervention or adherence of participants. The 
lack of effect on weight measures in some trials does not necessarily indicate that the rela-
tionship between SSBs and obesity indices is not causal, but rather can be explained by the 
content of intervention which might have failed to change behaviors  
[8] 
. Nevertheless, these 
education programs as intervention modalities are useful in the evaluation of so-called real-
world scenarios for policy decisions  
[8] 
. 
 
 
A strength of this work is the inclusion of a high number of published prospective cohort 
studies from 2013 to 2015 (n = 26). We must, however, admit that studies varied substan-
tially with respect to exposure assessment, adjustment for covariates, and specific outcomes 
evaluated. Associations between SSBs and body weight measures might be confounded by 
other diet and lifestyle factors  
[8] 
, but the majority of the prospective cohort studies adjusted 
for possible confounders including several nutrition and lifestyle factors, and for all, except 
for one study, a positive association was found. This suggests an independent effect of SSBs, 
even though residual confounding by unmeasured or poorly measured factors cannot be 
ruled out. Total energy adjustments might influence the direction of the relationship between 
SSB intake and body weight measures and might change research results, which was discussed 
in a review in 2015  
[15] 
. Adjustment for total energy intake is conducted due to controlling 
for confounding variables, for reducing variation, and for predicting the effect of the inter-
vention. However, as SSBs add calories to the diet, it has also been discussed that the 
adjustment for total energy intake might lead to an underestimation of the effect of SSBs on 
body weight as total energy intake mediates the association between SSBs and body weight 
 
[15] 
. In our systematic review, about half of the prospective cohort studies in children and 
also about half in adults adjusted for energy intake, but no RCT adjusted for that.

The purpose was to review the recent evidence after the last published systematic review 
by Malik et al. in 2013  
[8] 
. We compared the recently published studies between 2013 and 
2015 with those included in the study by Malik et al.  
[8] 
 and found that the current set of 
analysis confirm a significant association between SSB consumption and body weight gain or 
obesity indices. Interestingly, the number of articles increased quickly. Malik et al.  
[8] 
 included 
32 articles published between 1990 and 2012, and we found 30 articles published over a 
3-year period which means on average 10 publications per year. 
 
 
Regarding the countries where the studies were conducted, there was a higher percentage 
(61%) of publications from the US until 2012  
[8] 
 but a lower one (23%) between 2013 and 
2015. The percentage of studies from Europe has remained nearly the same (36% vs. 33%) 
and the remaining percentage of the newer studies were conducted in Middle/South-America 
(17%), Australia (7%), South Africa, Iran, Thailand, and Japan (10%). 
 
 
Furthermore, the study quality increased in the recent studies, particularly in prospective 
cohort studies, compared to those before 2012. Accordingly, 63% of studies after 2013 
compared to 50% before 2012 showed a good study quality. In the systematic review by 
Malik et al.  
[8] 
, the trials in children used two modalities, either reducing SSBs by substitution 
with non-caloric beverages or school-based education programs aimed at discouraging intake 
of SSBs. From 2013 to 2015, only trials with education programs were published (nutritional 
and healthy lifestyle education programs). In adults, the most recent RCT used an education 
program, and, contrary to the publications before 2013 summarized by Malik et al.  
[8] 
, the 
authors used a different type of intervention (SSBs were added to the normal diet in comparison 
with artificially sweetened beverages, milk, water or dietary advice). 
 
 
The food and beverage industry commonly sponsors studies, and it is recognized that 
conclusions of scientific research might be biased. The systematic review before 2013 
revealed that studies financed by the food and beverages industry were five times more likely 
to show no positive association with obesity indices than those without conflict of interest 
 
[13] 
. In our systematic review, none of the studies included was funded by industry, and only 
one author declared receiving an industrial grant. 
 
 
Public Health Considerations and Perspectives  
 
Numerous countries across the world have high levels of SSB consumption, and even 
those with low intakes are observing sharp increases  
[53] 
. Therefore, the combined evidence 
published before and after 2013 confirming that SSBs have adverse effects on body weight 
gain or obesity indices in children and adults provides a rationale for urgent policy action. 
From a public health perspective, unsweetened or very little sweetened water or tea might 
be considered as appropriate alternatives  
[53] 
. Various countries have now established and 
implemented approaches focusing on the reduction of SSB intake by limiting its availability, 
increasing market price, raising public awareness through education programs via the media 
or at school, introducing tax policies, and improving labeling  
[3] 
. Several studies meanwhile 
have shown that the purchase of SSBs is decreasing in countries following the introduction of 
taxes on SSBs, e.g. Mexico  
[54] 
. In this country, a greater reduction in purchases of SBBs was 
found in 2015 compared to 2014, and the absolute and relative reductions were highest 
among households at lower socioeconomic levels. In addition, the purchases of other untaxed 
drinks went up on average by 2% over 2 years. However, there is to date no evidence that the 
tax on SBBs in Mexico has had any impact on levels of obesity. 
 
 
A report from Euromonitor International  
[55] 
 indicates that 19 countries had so far 
introduced taxes on food and drinks and more would do so in the near future with the aim of 
reducing sugar consumption by 20% in accordance with the WHO guidelines. An increasing 
number of European states recognize the importance of reducing SSB intake to prevent 
childhood obesity and plan to introduce SBB taxes  
[56] 
. However, taxes should be lower for

SBBs with low concentration of sugar in order to provide incentives for the beverages industry. 
In addition, as the consumption of fruit juice with added sugar is increasing worldwide, they 
should also be considered for taxation.
 
 
Novel and innovative strategies are urgently needed. One successful and feasible example 
of a gradual reduction strategy is the UK salt reduction program: The food industry has grad-
ually decreased the quantity of salt added to processed food over the past decade  
[57] 
. In this 
program, incremental salt reduction targets were set with a clear timeframe for the food 
industry to reach it. It was implemented by the Food Standards Agency, a non-ministerial 
government department of the UK. This strategy might be the key to success as the population 
salt intake was reduced by 15%  
[57] 
. By analyzing the data from the Health Survey for 
England, the reduction in salt intake is likely to be accompanied by a lowering of population 
blood pressure. Consequently, this would have contributed substantially to the decreases in 
mortality from stroke and ischemic heart disease  
[58] 
. Coming back to sugar, a recent 
modeling study demonstrated that an incremental reduction in free sugars added to SSBs 
without the use of artificial sweeteners is predicted to reduce the prevalence of overweight, 
obesity, and type 2 diabetes  
[3] 
. The findings of this study suggest that this innovative strategy 
might lead to an effective and sustainable reduction of energy intake and obesity in the popu-
lation. The authors concluded that a systematic and gradual reduction in free sugars added 
to SSBs by 40% over 5 years is a feasible and important public health strategy  
[3] 
. However, 
it seems important to offer an overall package of strategies or approaches to reduce free 
sugars added to SSBs but also to solid foods. 
 
 
Future research should focus on the following questions: How can we effectively reduce 
the consumption of SSBs in different populations? What is the impact of interventions on 
body weight or obesity indices in children and adults? What are the responsibilities of the 
food and beverages industry, policy makers, public health institutions, communities, schools, 
and individuals? Is a sugar tax feasible and effective for solid food, and what impact will it 
have? 
 
 
The balance between the responsibility of individuals, health advocates, and govern-
ments and society must be clarified. It is important to mobilize multiple stakeholders and to 
develop operational synergies across different sectors. Professional networks and the food 
and beverages industry must be encouraged to promote healthy diets in accordance with 
international standards.
