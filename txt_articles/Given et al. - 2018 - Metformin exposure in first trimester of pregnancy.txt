Abstract
Objective
To investigate whether exposure to metformin during 
the first trimester of pregnancy, for diabetes or 
other indications, increases the risk of all or specific 
congenital anomalies.
Design
Population based exploratory case-control study using 
malformed controls. Cases of 29 specific subgroups of 
non-genetic anomalies, and all non-genetic anomalies 
combined, were compared with controls (all other 
non-genetic anomalies or genetic syndromes).
Setting
11 EUROmediCAT European congenital anomaly 
registries surveying 1 892 482 births in Europe 
between 2006 and 2013.
Participants
50 167 babies affected by congenital anomaly 
(41 242 non-genetic and 8925 genetic) including live 
births, fetal deaths from 20 weeks’ gestation, and 
terminations of pregnancy for fetal anomaly.
Main outcome measure
Odds ratios adjusted for maternal age, registry, 
multiple birth, and maternal diabetes status.
Results
168 babies affected by congenital anomaly (141 non-
genetic and 27 genetic) were exposed to metformin, 
3.3 per 1000 births. No evidence was found for a 
higher proportion of exposure to metformin during 
the first trimester among babies with all non-genetic 
anomalies combined compared with genetic controls 
(adjusted odds ratio 0.84, 95% confidence interval 
0.55 to 1.30). The only significant result was for 
pulmonary valve atresia (adjusted odds ratio 3.54, 
1.05 to 12.00, compared with non-genetic controls; 
2.86, 0.79 to 10.30, compared with genetic controls).
Conclusions
No evidence was found for an increased risk of all 
non-genetic congenital anomalies combined following 
exposure to metformin during the first trimester, and 
the one significant association was no more than 
would be expected by chance. Further surveillance 
is needed to increase sample size and follow up the 
cardiac signal, but these findings are reassuring given 
the increasing use of metformin in pregnancy.
Introduction
Metformin is an oral blood glucose lowering drug 
that has been used in the treatment of type 2 diabetes 
since the 1950s.1 Despite reservations about its use 
in pregnancy, metformin has been recommended for 
use in pregnancy in the UK since 2008 in women with 
gestational diabetes and in type 2 diabetes when the 
likely benefits outweigh the potential for harm.2 3 The 
emergence of type 2 diabetes in children and younger 
women of childbearing age has driven a sharp increase 
in the prevalence of type 2 diabetes in pregnancy,4 5 
which, together with these recommendations,3 is likely 
to further increase the number of women exposed to 
metformin in pregnancy.
Metformin is also prescribed in polycystic ovary 
syndrome, in which it improves insulin sensitivity, 
may aid weight reduction, and helps to normalise the 
menstrual cycle (increasing the rate of spontaneous 
ovulation).6 Exposure to metformin in early pregnancy 
among women undergoing treatment for polycystic 
ovary syndrome may therefore occur. The use of 
metformin to prevent diabetes in pre-diabetic 
populations, as a cancer treatment,7 8 and as a weight 
loss medication for non-diabetic obesity is also of 
interest.9 10 Expansion of indications for metformin 
use will increase the risk of unintentional exposures 
during pregnancy.
The use of metformin in pregnancy remains 
controversial.11 12 Metformin affects stem cell function 
and has been shown to cross the human placenta at 
term, exposing the fetus to concentrations approaching 
those in the maternal circulation.13-17 Animal studies 
have shown no increased risk of congenital anomaly 
at therapeutic doses,18-20 but these are limited in terms 
of predicting risk in humans.21 Three meta-analyses

Metformin affects stem cell function and has been shown to cross the human 
placenta at term, exposing the fetus to concentrations approaching those in the 
maternal circulation
Limited evidence from three meta-analyses and a cohort study suggests that the 
rate of all major congenital anomalies combined is not significantly increased 
after exposure to metformin
As teratogens tend to increase the risk of specific, rather than all, congenital 
anomalies, an increased risk of specific congenital anomalies after first trimester 
metformin exposure cannot be ruled out
WhAt thIs study Adds
In a large international, population based database, no evidence was found of 
an overall increased risk of congenital anomalies after first trimester metformin 
exposure
A raised risk of one specific cardiac defect may be a chance finding
Further surveillance is needed to increase sample size and follow up the cardiac 
signal, but these results are reassuring given the increasing use of metformin in 
pregnancy

have been conducted to explore the risk of congenital 
anomaly following exposure to metformin in humans 
and have concluded that no evidence exists to suggest 
a significantly increased risk of all major congenital 
anomalies compared with maternal disease matched 
control 
groups.22-24 
These 
meta-analyses 
were, 
however, based on small heterogeneous samples from 
studies that were not specifically designed to evaluate 
the rate of congenital anomalies.22 25 A recently 
published cohort study based on 392 women exposed 
to metformin who contacted teratogen information 
services found an increased risk of major birth defects 
among women taking metformin for diabetes but not 
for other indications. The authors concluded that the 
increased risk was due to the underlying diabetes, 
but they did not have a diabetic comparison group.26 
Any investigation of the risk of congenital anomaly 
associated with metformin is complicated by the fact 
that pregestational diabetes increases the risk of major 
congenital anomaly two to threefold.27 28 Metformin, 
if used for diabetes or pre-diabetes, may lead to a 
decreased risk of congenital anomaly as a result of 
achieving better glycaemic control,29 to an increased 
risk of congenital anomaly due to independent 
teratogenic action, or both.
To date, the size of the exposed population covered 
in the literature is too small to rule out risks of specific 
malformations. EUROmediCAT, a population based 
reproductive pharmacovigilance system based on 
the European Surveillance of Congenital Anomalies 
(EUROCAT) network,30 31 provides an opportunity to 
contribute much needed epidemiological evidence 
from a large population to the available literature. The 
aim of this study was to investigate whether exposure 
to metformin during the first trimester increases the 
risk of all or specific congenital anomalies.
Methods
Study design
We did an exploratory case-control study using 
malformed controls, using the EUROmediCAT central 
database. The use of malformed controls was initially 
proposed for birth defect epidemiology as a method 
of controlling for maternal recall bias (box 1).36 38 It is 
used in EUROmediCAT to control for the source of drug 
exposure data and because data on non-malformed 
controls are not available.39
Study population and data
EUROCAT population based registries record all major 
congenital anomalies among live births, fetal deaths 
at 20 weeks’ gestation or later, and terminations 
of pregnancy for fetal anomaly, using ICD-10 
(international classification of diseases, 10th revision) 
codes.40 41 Detailed descriptions of registries and the 
methods used have been published previously.30 42 43 
The EUROmediCAT database includes data, since 
1995, from those EUROCAT registries that record first 
trimester drug exposure either directly or through 
linkage with healthcare databases with information 
on prescribing and dispensing of drugs.44 Exposure to 
metformin in the first trimester was rare before 2006, 
so this study was based on data from 2006 onwards. 
Registries with less than three exposures were 
excluded.
Congenital 
anomalies 
are 
classified 
to 
91 
standard “EUROCAT subgroups.”40 41 These include 
hierarchical subgroups—for example, spina bifida is 
a subgroup that forms part of the subgroup “neural 
tube defects,” which forms part of the group “nervous 
system.” These subgroups are furthermore divided 
into non-genetic and genetic categories, according to 
whether a genetic syndrome has been diagnosed in 
association with the congenital anomaly subgroup in 
question.
Case and control groups
Cases and controls were live births, fetal deaths from 
20 weeks, and terminations of pregnancy for fetal 
anomaly.41 The literature contains no signals for 
specific congenital anomalies potentially associated 
with 
metformin 
that 
would 
suggest 
previous 
hypotheses to test as “cases.” We did an exploratory 
analysis in which, for each analysis, we considered a 
single non-genetic EUROCAT subgroup of congenital 
anomaly to be the “case” group.40 41
We used two control groups. “Non-genetic controls” 
were the remaining babies with non-genetic congenital 
anomalies after exclusion of the specific congenital 
anomaly being analysed as the case group and of any 
subgroup at a hierarchical level above. Genetic controls 
included chromosomal anomalies, skeletal dysplasias, 
congenital skin disorders, genetic syndromes, and 
microdeletions.
When analysing hypospadias as a case group, we 
used only male controls. We excluded babies with 
isolated congenital hip dislocation/dysplasia owing 
to the association with large babies and potential for 
confounding.45 We excluded cases and controls with 
maternal epilepsy or exposure to antiepileptic drugs 
owing to the association with congenital anomalies.46 47 
We cleaned the limb reduction defect subgroup by 
searching anomaly text descriptions for shortening of 
the limbs. We then reviewed the diagnosis for cases 
with this text description and reclassified those that 
had been misclassified as limb reduction defects 
(31/122 (25%) cases with this text description, 
excluding Norway and Paris for which no text was 
available).
When interpreting the results, we divided case 
subgroups according to whether or not they had 
previously been associated with pregestational 
diabetes in the EUROCAT database, according to 
Garne et al48—that is, neural tube defects, congenital 
heart 
defects, 
omphalocele, 
and 
syndactyly. 
This identified which results were most at risk 
of confounding by indication, requiring a more 
cautious interpretation.

maternity records. Additional data sources available 
for some registries included the medical records of 
the infant, records from the general practitioner, 
pregnancy passports, and maternal interviews before 
or after birth.31 42 49 For the Norway registry, drug 
exposures were based on prescription redemption 
records during the first trimester of pregnancy. The 
supplementary table gives more details. We excluded 
all terminations of pregnancy for fetal anomaly in 
Emilia Romagna, as they had no information on drug 
exposure (fig 1). We recorded all drug exposures in the 
first trimester by using the World Health Organization’s 
Anatomical 
Therapeutic 
Chemical 
classification 
system.50 This is a hierarchical system, which allocates 
to a drug a code based on the organ or system on 
which it acts (first level) and its therapeutic (second 
level), pharmacological (third level), and chemical 
properties (fourth and fifth level). We defined exposure 
to metformin as use of metformin, or a combination 
product (two or more drugs in a single tablet) containing 
metformin, during the first trimester. The Anatomical 
Therapeutic 
Chemical 
codes 
used 
to 
identify 
metformin exposure were A10BA02 (metformin), 
A10BD02 (metformin and sulfonylureas), A10BD03 
(metformin and rosiglitazone), A10BD05 (metformin 
and 
pioglitazone), 
A10BD07 
(metformin 
and 
sitagliptin), A10BD08 (metformin and vildagliptin), 
A10BD10 (metformin and saxagliptin), A10BD11 
(metformin and linagliptin), A10BD13 (metformin and 
alogliptin), A10BD14 (metformin and repaglinide), 
A10BD15 (metformin and dapagliflozin), A10BD16 
(metformin and canagliflozin), A10BD17 (metformin 
and acarbose), A10BD18 (metformin and gemigliptin), 
and A10BD20 (metformin and empagliflozin). For all 
registries, we defined the first trimester as the period 
from the first day of the last menstrual period to the 
end of gestational week 12.
Data on maternal illness before and during the 
first 20 weeks of pregnancy were recorded, mostly 
prospectively from maternity records, using ICD-10 
codes.41 This provided information on the potential 
indication for metformin use. In Norway, indications 
other than maternal diabetes were not recorded. 
We therefore excluded the Norway registry from all 
analyses relating to polycystic ovary syndrome and 
infertility. Registries individually verified all metformin 
exposures (cases or controls), the first trimester timing, 
indication for prescribing, and the malformation.
statistical analysis
Descriptive analyses of metformin use and risk 
of congenital anomaly associated with disease 
indications
We explored the relation between characteristics of 
the sample and all congenital anomalies, metformin 
exposure, 
genetic 
syndromes, 
and 
non-genetic 
congenital heart defects by using the Pearson χ2 test 
for birth type and multiple birth and the χ2 test for 
trend for maternal age and gestational age at delivery. 
We calculated the risk of all non-genetic congenital 
anomaly (compared with genetic syndrome controls) 
in relation to pregestational/gestational diabetes, 
polycystic ovary syndrome, and infertility (all 
indications for metformin use) to assess the degree to 
which confounding by indication might be expected.

Box 1: Case-control studies using malformed controls
• 
In a case-control study, a group of patients who have the disease of interest (cases) and a group who do not have the disease (controls) are 
selected, and the proportion with the exposure of interest in each group is compared.32
• 
In a case-control study using malformed controls, commonly used for congenital anomaly studies,33 a group of babies with a particular 
congenital anomaly of interest (cases) and a group who have different congenital anomalies (controls) are selected. This design is particularly 
suitable for investigating the specificity of association between specific malformations and specific exposures, rather than the overall risk of 
malformation.34
• 
Case-control studies using malformed controls were initially proposed to overcome maternal “recall bias.”35 Although this is not an problem 
for EUROmediCAT drug exposure data, which are mainly collected from prospective medical/maternity records, it is also a useful design when 
comparable data on non-malformed controls are not available.
• 
The main potential disadvantage of using malformed controls is “teratogen non-specificity bias.”36 37 This is where a teratogen causes many 
different malformations, some of which are included in the control group leading to an underestimation of risk. This can be avoided by 
excluding from the controls any malformation previously associated in the literature with the exposure in question and including a wide range 
of malformations in the control group, as no known teratogen increases the risk of all malformations to the same extent.36 An additional 
approach is to specify a control group of genetic syndromes, which cannot have been caused by environmental teratogens, but as their 
numbers are small this reduces statistical power.

We used logistic regression with listwise deletion to 
calculate odds ratios and 95% confidence intervals, 
adjusted for the confounders maternal age (<20, 20-
24, 25-29, 30-34, 35-39, ≥40) and registry.
Analysis of risk of congenital anomaly associated 
with metformin exposure
We calculated odds ratios for the risk of each case 
congenital 
anomaly 
group/subgroup 
related 
to 
metformin exposure without adjustment and with 
adjustment for the confounding factors maternal age, 
registry, multiple birth (singleton, multiple birth), and 
maternal pregestational/gestational diabetes (yes/no). 
For stability of parameter estimates, we show results 
for only those subgroups with at least three cases 
exposed to metformin. Where the same number of 
exposed cases was observed in a congenital anomaly 
subgroup and a subgroup in a hierarchical level above, 
we analysed it at the lowest hierarchical level only. We 
used Stata version 12.1 for all analyses.
Patient involvement
No patients were involved in setting the research 
question or the outcome measures, nor were 
they involved in developing plans for design or 
implementation of the study. No patients were asked to 
advise on interpretation or writing up of results. There 
are no plans to disseminate the results of the research to 
study participants or the relevant patient community.

Metformin use in study population and risk of 
congenital anomaly associated with disease 
indications
We recorded 53 689 babies affected by congenital 
anomaly in the EUROmediCAT database (2006-
13), out of 1 892 482 births surveyed, across the 11 
registries that were eligible to take part in this study. 
After exclusions (fig 1), 50 167 babies with congenital 
anomaly were left for analysis, consisting of 41 242 
with a non-genetic anomaly and 8925 with a genetic 
syndrome.
In all, 168 babies affected by congenital anomaly 
(141 non-genetic and 27 genetic) were exposed to 
metformin (3.3 per 1000 babies affected by congenital 
anomaly), of which two had a combined preparation 
(A10BD02 
metformin 
and 
sulfonylureas). 
The 
prevalence of metformin exposure varied across 
registries from 0.8 exposures per 1000 babies affected 
by congenital anomaly in Tuscany to 17.9 exposures 
per 1000 babies affected by congenital anomaly in 
Malta (table 1).
From the exposure rate of 3.3 per 1000 and the 
total population surveyed of 1 892 482 births, we can 
estimated that approximately 6245 pregnancies in the 
surveyed population were exposed (assuming no or 
a small overall increased rate of metformin exposure 
among babies with congenital anomalies).
Metformin exposure was more common among 
older mothers, multiple pregnancies, and preterm 
births (table 1). The proportion of genetic syndromes, 
among all babies with congenital anomalies, was 
higher in older mothers, singleton births, terminations 
of pregnancy for fetal anomaly, and preterm births 
(table 1). Congenital heart defects, the largest group 
of congenital anomalies and one associated with 
diabetes, formed a higher proportion of all non-genetic 
congenital anomalies with increasing maternal age, 
in multiple births, and in preterm births and a lower 
proportion of terminations of pregnancy for fetal 
anomaly (table 1).
After exclusion of cases from Norway, where 
information on maternal illness was limited, 54.4% 
of mothers had either pregestational or gestational 
diabetes, 
including 
44.0% 
with 
pregestational 
diabetes (table 2). Twenty four per cent had polycystic 
ovary syndrome, and 16.0% had infertility, indicated 
by an ICD-10 code for infertility or infertility treatment 
or exposure to a gonadotrophin or other ovulation 
stimulant. This left 18% (23/125) with no information 
available relating to the potential indication for 
metformin use (table 2).
The risk of all non-genetic anomalies compared with 
genetic controls was increased for maternal diabetes 
(pregestational or gestational) (adjusted odds ratio 
2.04, 95% confidence interval 1.75 to 2.38) and 
maternal pregestational diabetes (2.51, 1.89 to 3.34). 
We found no evidence for an increased risk of all non-
genetic anomalies compared with genetic controls 
for infertility (adjusted odds ratio 0.89, 0.66 to 1.19) 
or maternal polycystic ovary syndrome (0.81, 0.52 to 
1.27).
Analysis of risk of congenital anomaly with 
metformin exposure
We found no evidence for an increased risk of all 
non-genetic anomalies combined after exposure to 
metformin in the first trimester (adjusted odds ratio 
0.84, 0.55 to 1.30) (table 3). Twenty nine subgroups 
of congenital anomaly had three or more metformin 
exposed cases (table 3). Among the anomalies not 
previously associated with pregestational diabetes in 
the EUROCAT database, the risk of ano-rectal atresia 
and stenosis was increased, compared with non-genetic 
and genetic controls. This association attenuated 
slightly on adjustment for confounders and was no 
longer statistically significant. Among the anomalies 
previously associated with pregestational diabetes, we 
found increased risk of atrial septal defect, pulmonary 
valve atresia, and “patent ductus arteriosus as the 
only congenital heart defect in liveborn term infants” 
compared with genetic and non-genetic controls. 
The atrial septal defect and patent ductus arteriosus 
associations attenuated on adjustment, with maternal 
diabetes being the main confounder (data not shown). 
The only signal to remain after adjustment for diabetes 
and other confounders was for pulmonary valve 
atresia, compared with non-genetic controls (table 3). 
Of the three metformin exposed cases with pulmonary 
valve atresia, one mother had maternal pregestational 
diabetes and the other two were exposed to ovulation

stimulants, suggesting that metformin had been 
administered as part of infertility treatment.
discussion
We found no evidence of an overall increased risk 
of all major congenital anomalies combined after 
exposure to metformin during the first trimester.
Given the rise in exposure to metformin during 
pregnancy,51 
52 
our 
findings 
are 
particularly 
timely. Our large international, population based 
database, with 168 cases of congenital anomaly 
exposed to metformin, from an estimated 6245 
exposed pregnancies in Europe, represents more 
than five times the number of metformin exposures 
previously available in the literature.22-24 26 Exposure 
to metformin during the study period remained 
rare; just over three in every 1000 babies affected 
by congenital anomaly were exposed to metformin 
in the first trimester, with considerable variation in 
the prevalence of metformin use across registries. 
Similar variation was evident across Europe in a 
study that used prescription redemption records.52 
The variation in prescription of metformin between 
regions could be due to several factors—differences in

the prevalence of pregestational diabetes, polycystic 
ovary syndrome, and infertility53-55; the diagnostic 
criteria used for polycystic ovary syndrome56; and the 
criteria for prescription of metformin for the different 
indications. The current prevalence of exposure to 
metformin during pregnancy would be expected 
to be higher because of the increasing prevalence 
of type 2 diabetes.45 In keeping with the shared 
pathophysiological basis of the conditions for which 
metformin is indicated,57 some women had more than 
one indication for its use, also evidenced elsewhere.51
Our results are reassuring regarding the risk of 
all non-genetic congenital anomalies combined and 
support the previously available evidence.22-2426 
Teratogens, however, tend to increase the risk of 
specific, rather than all, congenital anomalies,58 
so focusing on specific congenital anomalies is 
important. We found a signal for pulmonary valve 
atresia. Pulmonary valve atresia has previously 
been associated with maternal diabetes,48 and our 
signal may suggest some residual confounding by 
indication. The number of comparisons made mean 
that this signal may also have arisen by chance. 
Pulmonary valve atresia has not been previously 
described after exposure to metformin during 
pregnancy.22 23 26 A recent teratogen information 
system cohort study found an elevated risk of cardiac 
defects following metformin exposure, but this was 
not significant and attenuated after adjustment for 
confounders.26
Although our findings are reassuring regarding 
the risk of congenital anomaly, further surveillance 
is recommended to increase the sample size and to 
follow up the pulmonary valve atresia signal in an 
independent dataset. The long term outcomes among 
babies who have been exposed to metformin in utero are 
also of interest. Metformin may have a direct influence 
on insulin action in the developing fetus, resulting 
in improved insulin sensitivity and a metabolically 
healthier pattern of growth into adulthood.59 60
Strengths and limitations of study
The main strength of this study is the use of the large 
international, 
population 
based, 
EUROmediCAT 
central database, the diverse nature of which improves 
the generalisability of our findings. EUROmediCAT 
also contains detailed and standardised coding 
of all congenital anomalies among live births and 
stillbirths, as well as terminations of pregnancy for 
fetal anomaly.30
Drug exposure in the EUROmediCAT database is 
mostly recorded prospectively, before anomaly status 
is known, which reduces the risk of recall bias. The 
exact timing of exposure within the first trimester is not 
recorded. It is likely that many metformin exposures 
would have been early in the first trimester during the 
critical period of development for many congenital 
anomalies, as women taking metformin for polycystic 
ovary syndrome or infertility are likely to stop their 
drug treatment when they realise they are pregnant. 
In most registries, normal clinical practice during our 
study period would have been to switch women who 
became pregnant while taking metformin for type 2 
diabetes to insulin.
Drug data were not available for terminations 
of pregnancy for fetal anomaly from the Emilia 
Romagna registry. In Norway, drug exposure data 
were based on a prescription database, and we 
cannot be certain that mothers took the drug they 
collected at the pharmacy. Under-ascertainment 
of drug exposure in the EUROmediCAT database is 
known to occur for diseases other than diabetes and 
epilepsy, for which drugs are well recorded in medical 
records.31 61 Comparison with Charlton et al suggests 
that metformin use may have been underreported 
in two of the registries.52 Any under-ascertainment 
of metformin exposure will be the same for cases 
and controls. This will have reduced the power of 
our analysis and may have slightly attenuated the 
estimated odds ratios. Teratogen non-specificity bias,

both cases and controls, may have attenuated odds 
ratios.39 To negate this, we used a very varied non-
genetic control group, as well as a genetic control 
group.
We adjusted for confounding by indication by 
adjusting for maternal diabetes, but controlling for 
glycaemia (HbA1c) would have been more effective if 
this had been available.62 Other indications (polycystic 
ovary syndrome, infertility) were not associated in our 
data with the risk of non-genetic anomalies overall, 
but they may have confounded associations relating to 
specific subgroups.
In a fifth of metformin exposures, no information 
was available to suggest the reason for metformin use. 
Even in a large US cohort of insured pregnant women, 
where the nature of health insurance data would be 
expected to ensure that the indication for prescribing 
a drug was recorded, no indication for prescribing of 
metformin was available in 16.4% of cases.51 Where 
gestational diabetes was the only recorded indication 
(6% of those exposed to metformin), this may have 
been a first trimester diagnosis of gestational diabetes 
due to undiagnosed pregestational diabetes, or missing 
information on obesity/polycystic ovary syndrome,3 as 
these women are at high risk of going on to develop 
gestational diabetes.57
Owing to multiple testing of many congenital 
anomaly subgroups, some positive associations are 
likely by chance alone. We did not find more significant 
associations than would be expected by chance.

Conclusion
We found no evidence of an overall increased risk of all 
major congenital anomalies combined after exposure 
to metformin during the first trimester. A signal for 
an increased risk of pulmonary valve atresia may 
be a chance finding. Although further surveillance 
is needed to increase sample size and follow up the 
cardiac signal, these findings are reassuring given the 
increasing use of metformin in pregnancy.
