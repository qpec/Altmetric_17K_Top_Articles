Abstract
Background
Measurement of mortality and injury in conflict situations presents many challenges com-
pared with stable situations. However, providing information is important to assess the
impact of conflict on populations and to estimate humanitarian needs, both in the immediate
and longer term. Mosul, Iraq’s second largest city, was overrun by fighters of the Islamic
State of Iraq and Syria (ISIS) on June 4, 2014. In this study, we conducted household sur-
veys to measure reported deaths, injuries, and kidnappings in Mosul, Iraq, both during the
occupation of the city by fighters of ISIS and the months of Iraqi military action known as the
liberation.
Methods and findings
Mosul was overrun by ISIS forces on June 4, 2014, and was under exclusive ISIS control for
29 months. The military offensive by Iraqi forces, supported by coalition artillery and air-
strikes, began on October 17, 2016, in east Mosul and concluded in west Mosul with the
defeat of ISIS on June 29, 2017. We conducted a 40-cluster population-based survey as
soon as the security forces permitted access for the survey team. The objective of the sur-
vey was to measure reported deaths, injuries, and kidnappings in Mosul households during
29 months of ISIS-exclusive control (June 2014–October 2016) and the nine months of Iraqi
military action known as the liberation (October 2016–June 2017). In east Mosul, the survey
was conducted from March 23 to March 31, 2017, and in west Mosul from July 18 to July 31,
2017. Sampling was based on pre-ISIS population distribution, with revisions made follow-
ing the extensive destruction in west Mosul. The 1,202 sampled households included 7,559
persons: 4,867 in east Mosul and 2,692 in west Mosul. No households declined to partici-
pate. During the time from June 4, 2014, to the time of the survey, there were 628 deaths
reported from the sampled households, of which 505 were due to intentional violence, a
mortality rate of 2.09 deaths per 1,000 person-months. Over the entire time period, the
group with the highest mortality rates from intentional violence was adults aged 20 to 39:
1.69 deaths per 1,000 person-months among women and 3.55 among men. In the 29

 months of ISIS-exclusive control, mortality rates among all males were 0.71 reported deaths
per 1,000 person-months and for all females were 0.50 deaths per 1,000 person-months.
During the nine months of the military liberation, the mortality rates jumped to 13.36 deaths
per 1,000 person-months for males and 8.33 for females. The increase was particularly
dramatic in west Mosul. The leading cause of reported deaths from intentional violence was
airstrikes—accounting for 201 civilian deaths—followed by 172 deaths from explosions.
Reported deaths from airstrikes were most common in west Mosul, while reported deaths
from explosions were similar on both sides of Mosul. Gunshots accounted for 86 cases,
predominantly in west Mosul where ISIS snipers were particularly active. There were 35 per-
sons who were reported to have been kidnapped, almost entirely prior to the military offen-
sive. By the time of the survey, 20 had been released, 8 were dead, and 7 still missing,
according to household reports. Almost all of the 223 injuries reported were due to inten-
tional violence. Limitations to population-based surveys include a probable large survivor
bias, the reliance on preconflict population distribution figures for sampling, and potential
recall bias among respondents.
Conclusions
Death and injuries during the military offensive to liberate Mosul considerably exceeded
those during ISIS occupation. Airstrikes were the major reported cause of deaths, with the
majority occurring in west Mosul. The extensive use of airstrikes and heavy artillery risks an
extensive loss of life in densely populated urban areas. The high probability of survivor bias
in this survey suggests that the actual number of injuries, kidnappings, and deaths in the
neighborhoods sampled is likely to be higher than we report here.
Author summary
Why was this study done?
• The Islamic State of Iraq and Syria (ISIS) controlled Mosul, Iraq’s second largest city,
from June 2014 until it was militarily defeated in June 2017.
• No information was available about population events among those living under the
control of ISIS or during the military campaign to destroy ISIS.
• This study was undertaken to measure the injuries, deaths, and kidnappings that
occurred during the 29 months ISIS controlled Mosul and the impact on households
during the nine months of military actions to regain Mosul.
What did the researchers do and find?
• The study sampled 1,202 households in 40 neighborhoods, 25 in east Mosul and 15 in
west Mosul, as soon as Iraqi security forces permitted entry of the survey team.
• The mortality rates during the 29 months of exclusive ISIS control were 0.71 and 0.50
reported deaths per 1,000 person-months for males and females, respectively. During
the military campaign against ISIS, these mortality rates jumped to 13.36 and 8.33

 reported deaths per 1,000 person-months. The increase was particularly dramatic in
west Mosul and high among males.
• The leading cause of reported deaths among the 505 who died from intentional violence
was airstrikes—accounting for 201 civilian deaths in survey households—followed by
172 deaths from explosions.
What do these findings mean?
• Mortality rates were much higher during the nine months of the military liberation of
Mosul than during the 29 months of exclusive ISIS control. The rates for reported
deaths were much higher in west Mosul, where house-to-house fighting and aerial and
artillery attacks were more intense and population density greater. High mortality rates
resulted despite the use of modern precision-targeted ordnance.
Introduction
Measurement of mortality in conflict situations using epidemiological methods presents many
challenges [1]. Numbers of deaths can be counted by observers, as has been done in the Syrian
crisis [2]. Such counts, even if meticulously done, risk both substantial undercounting and
potential double counting. With extensive displacement, accurate denominators may not be
available or based on out-of-date census data, making sampling difficult. Where households
are fragmented, key informants may be missing. Even when the household is intact, recall bias
may occur. Survival bias, in which households have been destroyed and are not present to
report, can cause serious underreporting [3]. Assessing causes of death is also difficult because
populations may be unable or unwilling to report causes [4]. Prevailing political opinions may
result in findings being maligned or dismissed [5].
Fighters belonging to the Islamic State of Iraq and Syria (ISIS) overran Mosul, Iraq’s second
largest city, on June 4, 2014 (Box 1). This caused the flight of Iraqi military forces and perhaps
a half-million civilians. Once under ISIS control, the city’s economy rapidly collapsed [6].

 Taxes were increased, unemployment rose, services deteriorated, electricity generation
stopped completely, and poverty increased substantially. Houses were seized if they belonged
to minorities or persons who had fled Mosul. The ability to leave Mosul was severely restricted
by ISIS fighters. A rigid set of civil and religious codes were put in place. Dress codes for
women became more extreme, requiring even the eyes to be covered with a black gauze. The
omnipresent Al Hesba, or morality police, patrolled the city streets, offices, schools, and hospi-
tals, issuing citations to women deemed to be inappropriate in behavior or dress. Health work-
ers were forbidden to speak with persons of the opposite sex, either colleagues or patients.
Smoking, picnicking, or watching football videos were punished with fines, flogging, and
sometimes death, often meted out with a casual indifference.
Military preparation to retake Mosul started in 2016. A force was assembled of regular Iraqi
military units (Iraqi security forces [ISF]), Popular Militia Units (PMUs), and Kurdish Pesh-
merga troops. At the start of the military campaign, there were already an estimated 1.2 million
displaced persons in the Nineveh governorate, constituting 37.5% of Iraq’s internally displaced
persons (IDPs) [7]. An estimated 1 million persons fled Mosul during the liberation campaign
[8]. About 1.5 million persons were thought to be still living in Mosul at this time, some having
entered Mosul with ISIS.
Military action against ISIS began on October 17, 2016, with attacks in east Mosul (Box 1).
Mosul was declared liberated when west Mosul was secured at the end of June 2017. Although
the Iraqi government had initially asked residents not to leave the city during the military cam-
paign, some 161,718 persons fled east Mosul and many more from west Mosul [9]. During
fighting, residents fleeing would move toward the frontline at great risk, hopefully to be gath-
ered by Iraqi forces for transfer out of Mosul. During the slow military advance into west
Mosul, widescale destruction occurred, which obliterated whole neighborhoods. ISIS fighters,
retreating from east Mosul, had fortified the area with bombs and booby traps. Civilian popu-
lations were used as human shields by ISIS fighters, and those trying to flee were often picked
off by snipers [10]. Many who sought safety in the basements of houses were systematically
killed. At the same time, there was great concern about the destruction caused by airstrikes on
west Mosul [11].
With measurement limitations in mind, we set out to conduct a household survey in
Mosul, attempting to improve accuracy and address difficulties previously encountered. The
survey objectives were to measure deaths, injuries, and kidnappings during the 29 months of
exclusive control by ISIS and during the nine months of Iraqi military action known as the
liberation.
Methods
This population survey was conducted as soon as ISF allowed the survey team entry into
Mosul and before large-scale population return began, even though the security situation was
still unsettled. Forty neighborhoods or administrative units were randomly selected from
Mosul’s established residential administrative units. A typical neighborhood would have con-
tained 200 to 400 dwellings before Mosul’s seizure by ISIS. There were 25 neighborhoods
selected on the east side of the Tigris River and 15 selected on the west side, representative of
the population distribution of Mosul before seizure by ISIS. There were no data on population
shifts or remaining population during ISIS occupation and the subsequent liberation. In each
neighborhood, a “start house” was identified by a random method that used a 10-m grid over-
lay of the selected neighborhood on an aerial map of Mosul. From the start house, 30 adjacent
houses were visited, constituting a cluster. Reserve neighborhoods with start houses were iden-
tified should the selected neighborhood be inaccessible. The 4 interviewers were physicians

 with a doctoral degree in community medicine. Three were female, and all were natives of
Mosul but had left as ISIS seized Mosul. Training was provided for this specific survey.
The questionnaire was based on those used in several previous Iraqi household surveys. It
was adapted for the objectives of this study by the Mosul health workers and Al Mustansiriya
University faculty. Pilot testing was carried out in a safer area of Mosul separate from any
selected neighborhood and required changes made to the forms and procedures before begin-
ning the survey. The deaths, injuries, and kidnappings sections of the household questionnaire
are found in S1 Text. The sample size of 1,200 households was deemed adequate to measure
household characteristics of interest in a conflict-affected urban environment and still provide
capacity for comparisons, based on several previous surveys in conflict-affected parts of Iraq.
For this survey, a household was defined as a group of people living together, eating from a
common kitchen, and living in a structure with a separate entrance from the street. In the case
of multihousehold dwellings, a household was considered separate if it had a separate kitchen.
An inclusion requirement was that a household had been present in Mosul during the
entire period from June 2014 until the time of the survey. At each house, permission was
secured from the head of household. The head of household or the senior female was inter-
viewed. Demographic and household details since June 2014 were recorded. No attempt was
made to identify former ISIS supporters or former employees of ISIS. An interview required
approximately 1 hour and was conducted in privacy.
After interviewing the start house, interviewers moved to the next dwelling to the right. At
intersections, they turned to the right, continuing to the next dwellings. All dwellings were vis-
ited consecutively until 30 had been interviewed. Where a dwelling had been destroyed or was
unoccupied, the interviewers noted its presence and continued in the same direction to the
next occupied dwelling. Interviewer safety was a major concern. The interview teams used cau-
tion moving between houses and conducted interviews from midmorning to midafternoon to
avoid attention. Sometimes the next housing compound could be entered through a door in a
compound wall, thus allowing interviewers to avoid being visible on the street to security
forces, although security permissions had been obtained before entering an area. Constant cell
phone connections were maintained with other interviewers and with the supervisors.
Detailed emergency plans were made for the survey teams about what actions were to be taken
if mortar attacks occurred or other physical danger developed. A series of protected locations
were identified for emergency shelter. During a mortar attack that did occur, the survey team
joined the household they were interviewing in their household shelter.
The survey of east Mosul was conducted from March 23 to 31, 2017. With the slow military
progress, the survey was conducted in west Mosul from July 18 to July 31, 2017. All selected
neighborhoods in east Mosul were surveyed as planned. However, the extensive destruction
and population shifts in parts of west Mosul required a change in the sampling frame (Fig 1).
For this, the team determined which neighborhoods were still inhabited, from which 15 were
randomly selected. Of the 5 reserve neighborhoods that were set aside for west Mosul, 2 were
eventually used, one because of insecurity and a second to replace a selected neighborhood
with few households remaining. The location of the clusters surveyed are listed in Table 1,
along with the proportion of houses that were found empty or destroyed in that cluster.
Analysis
Prior to the data collection, a data analysis plan that included data entry in Baghdad was for-
mulated, with initial frequencies and tabulation to be carried out there. Further analysis would
be carried out in Baltimore depending on the results of the initial analysis and discussion. In
Baltimore, statistical analysis used Stata version 15 (College Station, TX). The individual

 exposure times for respondents were calculated beginning from the seizure of control of Mosul
by ISIS in June 2014 until the month of interview (March 2017 in east Mosul and July 2017 in
west Mosul). For respondents, exposure times reflect the month of entry or exit from the house-
hold, notably in the case of death, kidnapping, or birth. Incidence rates for death and injury
were calculated from the total number of deaths and/or injuries divided by the total number of
person-months contributed using the “stptime” command in Stata, which allowed for variable
follow-up time for each individual by dividing the number of failures (i.e., the number of deaths
or injuries) by total person-time contributed. Stratified incidence rates were calculated in the
same manner individually by age group, geographic area (west/east Mosul), sex, and time
period (ISIS occupation versus liberation). For each of these analyses, the number of deaths or
injuries in each respective age, sex, area group, or time period was divided by the total number
of person-time contributed, then multiplied to estimate rates per 1,000 person-months. To cal-
culate incidence rate ratios (IRRs) comparing death rates between geographic areas (in west

 versus east Mosul) within sex and age groups, a Poisson model was fit, allowing person-specific
time contributed (in person-months). Bootstrapping was used to account for clustering that
occurred at the sampling level in calculating CIs [12]. Similar comparison of injury rates was
not performed given the limited number and distribution of injuries. Descriptive statistics
(numbers and proportions) were also calculated for causes of death and injury, as well as physi-
cal location of injuries. Minimal underlying data for this manuscript are deposited publicly in
the Humanitarian Data Exchange and can be accessed at https://data.humdata.org/dataset/

 Deaths
During the ISIS occupation and the liberation period, there was a total of 241,093 person-
months (20,091 person-years) of exposure by the surveyed households in Mosul (Table 3). The
full data are shown in person-years in S1 Table. This allows comparison with other events
reported in person-years. Exposure in east Mosul was 150,888 person-months (12,574 person-
years) and 90,205 person-months (7,517 person-years) in west Mosul. During this time, 628
deaths occurred among survey households in Mosul for an overall rate of 2.61 deaths per 1,000
person-months. Of these 628 deaths, 505 were due to intentional violence, a mortality rate of
2.09 deaths per 1,000 person-months. In east Mosul survey households, the intentional-vio-
lence mortality rates for persons under 60 years old ranged between 0.65 for those aged 40 to
59 years to a high of 1.44 for those aged 20 to 39 years. In west Mosul survey households, inten-
tional-violence rates ranged from 2.66 among those 5 to 19 years of age to a high of 4.88 for
those aged 20 to 39 years. When comparing the intentional-violence mortality rates between
sexes for Mosul survey households as a whole (Table 3), the mortality rates among females was
the lowest at 1.23 per 1,000 person-months among those aged 40 to 59 years and highest at
2.37 for children under 5 years. Conversely, among males, intentional-violence mortality rates
were lowest among children under 5 years at 1.71 and highest among those in the 20- to
39-year-old age group at 3.55. Deaths occurred principally during liberation (Fig 3). The
bimodal pattern in Fig 3 corresponds to the movement of conflict from east to west Mosul.
During this time, mortality rates were similar between males and females and between east
and west Mosul, although the overall number of deaths was consistently higher among males,
especially in the 20- to 39-year-old age group (Fig 4).
The crude IRR of deaths due to intentional violence in survey households comparing west
to east Mosul shows a substantially higher death rate in west Mosul measured in person-
months (Table 3). The death rate in west Mosul overall was 3.39 (CI 2.21–5.19) times higher
than in east Mosul; 3.28 (CI 2.20–4.88) times higher among males; and among females, 3.59
(CI 1.90–6.78) times higher. Differences in intentional-violence death rates between east and
west Mosul households were statistically significant for both males and females (P < 0.001).
When analyzed by age group, the IRR comparing deaths due to intentional violence in west to
east Mosul among females was lowest in the 5- to 19-year-old age group (IRR = 2.09) and high-
est among those over 60 years (IRR = 15.31). Among males, the highest IRR observed was also
among those aged 40 to 59 years (IRR = 4.43) and lowest among those over 60 years old
(IRR = 2.33).
Causes of death
The reported causes of death from both nonviolent causes and from intentional violence are
shown in Table 4. The most common medical cause of death was cardiovascular disease fol-
lowed by renal conditions and injuries not related to conflict. Intentional violence was respon-
sible for 338 (84.9%) reported deaths in west Mosul and 167 (74.9%) deaths in east Mosul. In
west Mosul survey households, airstrikes were the single most common reported cause of
death, accounting for 167 (72.6%) deaths due to intentional violence. In the east Mosul house-
holds, airstrikes were responsible for 45 (26.9%) deaths, with explosions the largest single
group, responsible for 83 (49.7%) deaths (Fig 5).
The all-cause mortality rates during the 29 months of exclusive ISIS control and the nine
months of the military offensive are shown in person-months in Table 5. The same data are
shown in person-years in S2 Table. During ISIS control, mortality rates among males were
0.71 deaths per 1,000 person-months (8.47 per 1,000 person-years) and for females 0.50 deaths
per 1,000 person-months (5.99 per 1,000 person-years). During the military offensive, the rates

 jumped to 13.36 for males (160.4 per 1,000 person-years) and to 8.33 for females (99.92 per
1,000 person-years). The increase in death rates was particularly dramatic in west Mosul,
where it increased from a rate of 0.64 to 15.54 deaths per 1,000 person-months (7.71 per 1,000
person-years to 186.5) with the military offensive.
Kidnapping
Households reported that 35 members had been kidnapped during the time of ISIS control, 34
of whom were males. Twenty of these had been the head of household and 15 had been a son.
Of the 35 reportedly kidnapped, 7 were still missing, 20 had been released, and 8 were dead.
Injuries
Households were asked about injuries that occurred to household members during the years
of ISIS control and the liberation. The 223 injuries reported in detail were due to intentional
violence in all but 3 instances (Table 3). The reported causes of the injuries from intentional
violence are shown in Table 4, the majority being shell (45.9%) or blast (43.6%) injuries. Explo-
sions and shrapnel were the main causes of the injuries noted in Table 4. The treatment and
status of persons injured from all causes are noted in S3 Table. This lists the treatment received
at the time of the injury and status of the injured at the time of the survey. Among the injured,
30 (13.5%) were alive and functioning normally at the time of interview. There were 102
(45.7%) who were alive but with limited function, 7 (3.1%) who had died, and 84 (37.7%) who
were convalescing and still receiving treatment. At the time of injury, 153 (68.7%) had received

 inpatient hospital care. No formal care was reported for the day of injury for 46, or 20.8%, of
those injured.
Physical location of injuries
The location of the injuries sustained by persons both in east and west Mosul are shown in Fig
6. Of the 220 injuries noted, the specific location was not recorded for 23 injuries.
Discussion
This survey from the households of Mosul presents a picture of death and injury, most pro-
nounced during the nine-month military campaign to drive ISIS fighters from the city. The
mortality rate per 1,000 person-months jumped from a rate of 0.58 deaths per 1,000 person-
months during the 29 months of exclusive ISIS control to a rate of 6.29 in east Mosul during
the nine months of liberation. In west Mosul, the numbers increased from an ISIS rate of 0.64
to a rate of 15.54 during the nine months of the military liberation. However, the true numbers
of deaths and injuries that occurred in Mosul during this time cannot be known. In some west
Mosul clusters, the survey team found nearly as many empty or destroyed dwellings as occu-
pied ones, indicating a large survivor bias potential. These clusters were likely to have sus-
tained a much larger loss of life than surviving households reported. The actual population of
Mosul in the time of ISIS and during the military offensive is not known, making it not possi-
ble to estimate the numbers of dead and injured for the city as a whole. The study was con-
ducted immediately after ISIS had been driven from east Mosul and then again in west Mosul
as soon as it had been secured. The households included had been present in Mosul during the
Fig 4. Number of intentional-violence deaths by sex and age over the 36 months.

 entire 29 months of ISIS control and during the nine months of Iraqi military action. The pop-
ulation characteristics themselves create a remarkable pyramid. Teenage and younger women
were underrepresented, most likely related to an increased rate of early marriages driven by
the fear that daughters would be forced to marry ISIS fighters, a common situation in conflicts
[13]. It is likely that after marriage they left Mosul, either escaping entirely or moving to one of
the small towns or villages surrounding Mosul. Persons aged 50 and above constituted 19.3%
of the sample, compared with an estimated 10.7% for the Iraqi population as a whole [14]. The
percentage of older persons was higher in west Mosul (22.0%) compared with east Mosul

 (17.8%). Although west Mosul was the older and poorer part of the city, the population pattern
suggests that younger persons there may have been better able to flee the battlefront as it
moved from east to west. Although some may have managed to escape the city, others fled
across the Tigris River into east Mosul as the nature of the final struggle with ISIS became
evident.
Until about age 20, death rates from intentional violence for males and females were simi-
lar. After age 20, the mortality numbers and rates rose among males but stayed flat among
females. At older ages, this difference between males and females narrowed somewhat. This is
likely related to increased time outside the household by younger and early middle-aged

 males, increasing exposure to violent events. These findings demonstrate a pattern similar to
other Iraq mortality surveys [15]. Mortality rates from intentional violence were higher in west
Mosul (P < 0.001) and higher at all ages.

 Interviewers recorded the nature of the intentional violence–causing deaths reported by
households. In some cases, it may have been difficult for households to differentiate among
artillery, mortars, mines, and improvised rocket-assisted munitions (IRAMs), so these were all
classified as explosions. Explosions caused 172 deaths, which were in approximately equal
numbers in east and west Mosul. The difficulty in precise targeting with these weapons, includ-
ing heavy artillery fired from 10 to 20 km away, may have contributed to the number of civilian
deaths. Airstrikes caused the largest number of household deaths (201), and these were pre-
dominantly in west Mosul. Bombs of 500 pounds or greater have a blast radius possibly well
beyond the specific target. Even smaller munitions with a narrower blast radius could cause
civilian loss of life where ISIS was using civilians as human shields [16]. The Airwars monitor-
ing organization has mapped 1,933 coalition airstrikes in Mosul and in excess of 12,000 air-
strikes in Iraq as a whole since the start of 2015 [17]. When targets are examined on the
ground, it appears that at times, bombing may have been indiscriminate. Satellite maps show
extensive areas of extreme devastation in west Mosul [17]. As the Iraqi forces moved westward
across the Tigris, the spike in deaths from the preconflict period followed the movement of the
battlefront. The intensity of the conflict in west Mosul caused more household deaths com-
pared with east Mosul, even though the population of the households sampled was smaller.
Although military planners claimed that these airstrikes are “one of the most precise air cam-
paigns in military history,” the intensity of the urban conflict is probably unmatched since the
Second World War [18]. While some civilian deaths occurred in proximity to legitimate tar-
gets—accepted as “necessity” under international humanitarian law (IHL)—many civilians
were killed when targets of dubious military importance were targeted, perhaps through faulty
or outdated intelligence [19]. The civilian deaths from poor intelligence may have been com-
pounded through a breach of the IHL principle of proportionality, particularly with the use of
large ordnance [20]. Moving from the mortality rates found from these 1,202 households to
overall estimated for Mosul would be difficult. The events during the time of ISIS control
might be assumed to be fairly uniform across the city, so application of rates to an estimated
Mosul population could be appropriate. During the eight months of military operations, how-
ever, the use of high-powered ordnance was concentrated in certain areas, particularly in cer-
tain sectors of west Mosul, while strikes in east Mosul were relatively light. This would make
wider population estimates of mortality for Mosul more uncertain.
Of the 220 injuries reported, most were conflict related. The number of nonconflict inju-
ries seems rather small considering that nonconflict injuries were the preponderant injuries
reported in our Baghdad injury study [21]. Mosul violent injuries were more likely to involve
the abdomen and lower leg than those found in the 2003 to 2014 Baghdad injury study.
However, with the high-intensity conflict in Mosul, it is likely that minor nonconflict inju-
ries might be easily forgotten. The time trends associated with injuries for east and west
Mosul followed the same pattern as for deaths. It is likely that the causes were the same.
The fact that most injuries were treated as hospital inpatients suggests that these were gener-
ally of a serious nature. For the 20.8% of those injured who did not receive treatment on the
day of injury, this may reflect the lack of treatment facilities more than the severity of the
injuries, and it is likely that some died being unable to receive care. At the time of the inter-
view, only 13% of injured persons reported normal function, with over one-third still receiv-
ing some form of treatment for their injuries. While recall bias does complicate injury
surveys, it is unlikely that serious injuries, especially those resulting in disabilities, are easily
forgotten.
Kidnapping was common, though not as extensive as—and occurring for different reasons
than—among the Yazidis of Mt. Sinjar or in Baghdad, where kidnapping was politically or
criminally motivated [3]. Almost all persons reportedly kidnapped in this survey were

 males. The sole woman kidnapped was operating a beauty salon for women in her home. Kid-
nappings occurred before liberation and were related to a person’s previous activities, such as
having been a parliamentary candidate or associated with the Iraqi army in some way. Other
reasons for kidnapping were the trading of cigarettes or possibly using a mobile phone to con-
tact Iraq forces. No kidnapped person escaped; all were either released or were killed. At the
time of the survey, there were some who were still missing.
The distribution of causes of death not attributed to intentional violence is what might be
expected of an Iraqi population. However, health workers felt that lack of access to specialist
diagnosis and treatment, shortage of medicines, and limited access to food may have contrib-
uted to a higher mortality in some conditions.
These data illustrate what can be learned about illness and death in conflict situations as
well as the limitations of surveys. They also illustrate the additional measures required as well
as the personal risks in these types of surveys, which are absent in stable situations. Our find-
ings should be viewed as providing an important, though necessarily an incomplete, picture of
events. The final assessment of the state of the population during the 29 months of ISIS control
and the nine months of the liberation conflict will come from the triangulation of the findings
presented here with other data, both qualitative and quantitative.
Limitations
There are many limitations to this study, which was designed to assess population trends and
patterns from seizure by ISIS to the liberation by Iraqi forces, some 37 months later. The true
population of Mosul during the time of ISIS and during the liberation is unknown. Although
we used pre-ISIS population distribution data for Mosul, there is no assurance that this distri-
bution remained accurate at the time of survey. Particularly in west Mosul, the population
numbers and distribution were difficult to estimate because much of the housing was des-
troyed by airstrikes and explosives. We tried to compensate for this by dropping neighbor-
hoods that were extensively damaged or otherwise depopulated; however, this may not have
been sufficient. Survivor bias—that is, the inability to collect information from households
destroyed—undoubtedly was an important limitation. Some households were able to flee
Mosul and thus were not counted. Other households were entombed by artillery airstrikes and
from the actions of ISIS, which has been verified during excavations in damaged parts of
Mosul [22]. This survey represented the survivors, so it could not be an entirely cross-sectional
sample of the population who lived in Mosul during ISIS control. The large number of empty
or destroyed houses in west Mosul clusters most certainly indicates a substantial underestima-
tion of mortality and injury. Household members may have had difficulty differentiating artil-
lery explosions from airstrikes. Because neighborhoods are often family neighborhoods,
survivors from destroyed households could join with relatives from other households, and
thus the deaths and injuries reported might be incorrectly attributed to the household being
interviewed, though in these cases separate kitchens were usually maintained. Divided house-
holds might have specific events double counted. Although we tried to conservatively estimate
the person-months of exposure, it is possible that there was a flux of household residents who
were not accurately counted.
Conclusion
Despite many limitations, these data depict a city heavily damaged. Although the media
accounts report extensive brutality and wanton killing by ISIS, we found that the military
ground and airstrikes resulted in a death toll exceeding that reported during the ISIS occupa-
tion. The description of airstrikes that were stated to be “one of the most precise air campaigns

 in military history” seems not to be supported by our data, which found large numbers of civil-
ian deaths attributed to airstrikes [19]. The military offensive brought an increase in injury
and death that affected the young, the robust, and the elderly of Mosul to varying degrees.
Some persons were able to escape the city or escape the destruction around them, but many
were not, and their number we cannot completely measure.
