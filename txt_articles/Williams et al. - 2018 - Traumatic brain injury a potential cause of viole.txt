Su
Summar
ary: 
Traumatic Brain Injury (TBI) is the biggest cause of death and disability in children and 
young people. TBI compromises important neurological functions for self-regulation 
and social behavior and increases risk of behavioral disorder and psychiatric 
morbidity. Crime in young people is a major social issue. �E���� ��������� often 
continue for a lifetime. A substantial majority of young offenders are re-convicted 
soon after release. Multiple factors play a role in crime. We show how TBI is a risk 
factor for earlier, more violent, offending. TBI is linked to poorer engagement in 
treatment, in-custody infractions, and re-conviction. Schemes to assess and manage 
  
2 
TBI are under development. These might improve engagement of offenders in 
forensic psychotherapeutic rehabilitation and reduce crime.

Mechanism of injury:  TBIs involve an insult to the brain from an external mechanical 
(e.g. a blow to the head in an assault, a fall, or car crash). These injuries may lead to 
lacerations and bruising of the brain structures, especially around bony protrusions 
on the basal surface of the skull.(14) Internal bleeding and secondary hypoxia often 
occurs.(15) There may be focal injury � usually within frontal and temporal areas � 
and diffuse injury due to shearing of white matter tracts - particularly related to 
rotational injury at high speed).(16) In milder injuries there is potential for disruption 
to axonal connectivity. (16) 
 
Severity of Injury:  Glasgow Coma Scale (GCS) of 13 or above (out of a maximum of 15) 
denotes mild; a score of 9 � 12 is moderate; 8 or below severe. Post Traumatic 
Amnesia (PTA) and/or Loss of Consciousness (LOC) can be used to gauge severity of a 
historic TBI. Mild TBI is considered to involve 0-30 minutes of LOC, and 30 minutes 
and over being moderate to severe.(17)  A very mild injury � typically referred to as a 
������������ ����� ���� �������������� �� ��� time but no, or brief loss of 
consciousness) rarely leads to permanent brain changes. With increased severity 
there is a higher risk of chronic problems. With moderate to severe TBI there is, more 
likely than not, long term neurocognitive, behavioural and psychiatric disturbance.  
 
[INSERT BOX 2 HERE RE: PSYCHIATRIC MORBIDITY POST TBI]  
 
Incidence, Prevalence & Risk Factors: TBI is the largest cause of mortality and 
morbidity in children and young people.  It has been called a ������� ��������� � as it 
is often not recognised by social and health care professionals.(18) There is an 
aggregate hospitalized plus fatal TBI incidence rate of about 235 per 100,000 people 
across European countries. (19) With TBI severity ratio of hospitalized patients 
reported as 22:1.5:1 for mild vs. moderate vs. severe cases, respectively. In middle 
and low income countries three times as many people may suffer TBIs.(20) TBI 
frequently occurs from falls, sporting injuries, fights, assaults, and road accidents. 
Rates of injury are high, and equal, for both sexes in the very young (under 5), whilst 
adolescents and young adult males are the most �at risk� group.(21) In a general 
  
4 
population, the lifetime prevalence of a TBI � with some LOC- has been estimated 
around 8%(22) and 12%(23) - with men having twice the odds of having had a TBI 
compared to women.(23) There is a strong socio-economic gradient to TBI - 
disadvantage being a major risk factor.(21)

The neuropsychological effects of TBI tend to be amnestic and executive disorders 
(poor memory, attention, concentration, and planning). Deficits in emotional 
regulation - characterised by impulsiveness and poor social judgment � are common. 
Milder TBIs may lead to problems in attentional control and inhibitory functions.(24) 
Injury �� ��������� ������� ��� lead to increased risk of impulsive aggression, poor 
decision-making, and lack of control of social behaviour.(25) (26)  For example, 
veterans from the Vietnam War with injuries to frontal ventromedial cortex (part of 
frontal cortex involved in fear and risk) were rated as more aggressive and violent 
compared to non-injured controls and to patients with lesions in other brain areas 
(27).   
 
Self-regulation and the developing �“����� B�����:  That a preponderance of offenders 
������ ������ may be due to immaturity and/or vulnerability of brain systems for social 
cognition.  T�� ������� ����� ������� is complex and distributed.(28)  It  comprises 
systems for deducing emotions from facial expressions and vocal tone ��� ��������� 
������� ����� ��� ����������, and responding appropriately.(29)   These key abilities 
for socialisation have  differential developmental trajectories.(30) Reward systems 
become mature in mid-teens with increased sensation-seeking behaviour. Meanwhile 
areas for deliberate control of impulses and making judgments  - the dorso-lateral 
prefrontal cortex � reaches maturity in the late teenage years.(31)  Adolescents and 
young adults are, consequently, poorer at responding on problem solving tasks under 
emotional demand, particularly in social contexts, which increases risk taking 
behaviour.(29, 32) (33) (34) (35)  (1) 
 
TBI may disrupt development of these systems for social interaction and contribute to 
behavioural problems. Max and colleagues followed up 94 children aged 5 to 14 years 
  
5 
post TBI.(36) Personality change occurred in 59% of those with severe TBI (22/37) and 
5% of those with mild/moderate TBI (3/57). Emotional lability, aggression and 
disinhibition were most common. In a related study (n=���� �������� with such 
personality changes ���� ����� �� ���� lesions of the dorsal prefrontal cortex  (37).  
More recently ���� ���� ����� ����� ����������� ��������� �NPD� in 25 of 70 children 
(36%) after mild TBI.(38) ADHD, �personality change�, and oppositional defiance 
being most common. Pre-existing conditions, such as ADHD, are risk factors for TBI 
(39).  Interestingly, it has been shown that children with ADHD secondary to TBI tend 
to have worse dual attention and working memory compared to those with non-
injury ADHD, and to children with TBI only.(39) 
 
Changes in behaviour post TBI may have detrimental effects on key social roles. In an 
����� �� �������� �N����� �� ���� ��� ���� ������ �������� �� ��� ����� ���� ����� 
������� ������ ����� ��������� ��� ���������� ���� ������������� ��������

Two, linked,  cohort studies  showed that adults who had had TBI as children were 
significantly poorer at emotion perception than controls and had externalizing 
behaviour, poor pragmatic communication ability, and greater �������� ���� ��� ����. 
(41, 42)  
 
Injury in childhood and adolescence may, therefore, lead to impulsivity, poor socio-
communication skills, and concomitant �externalising� behaviours. Injury at this life 
stage may well disrupt the development of pro-social life roles.  Such patterns of 
behaviour could underlie a ����� ����� ��� ��������� �� ��� �����������  
 
Epidemiological Studies on TBI & Crime:  
There are birth cohort and data linkage studies in adolescents and adults that indicate 
that TBI is associated with increased risk of crime. However, although these studies 
implicate links between TBI and crime, there is a lack of clarity on actual causal 
mechanisms.

ort: In a study of around 12,000 males in Finland, TBI during childhood or 
adolescence was associated with a fourfold increased risk for mental disorder with 
coexisting offending in adulthood.(43) TBI before age 12 was linked to earlier onset of 
criminality. There was no adjustment for familial and socio-environmental confounds. 
Those injured younger may have had stronger risk factors for earlier TBI and 
criminality.  In a study in New Zealand, in which 1265 children were followed up to 
age 25, a TBI group, relative to control, were more likely to be arrested (44).  
Although, when alcohol and drug dependence were controlled for, TBI was no longer 
associated with crime in those who were injured between 0 and 5. Early substance 
use may be a mediating factor for crime in those injured at a very young age. In a 
birth cohort study in South West England (SWE), a TBI group � ����������� �� �M���� 
(n=800) - was at increased risk criminal behaviour by age 17 compared to non-TBI 
group (n = 8307) (Unadjusted OR 1.6 (1.2-2.2). (45) Associations were confounded by 
substance use. Furthermore, the TBI group were no different to an orthopaedic injury 
group (n: 2305) ((Adjusted OR=1.1 (1.1-1.6)). TBI was, though, linked to hazardous 
alcohol use, externalising symptoms, conduct problems, and ADHD.  
 
The evidence for TBI leading to crime from birth cohort studies are, therefore, mixed. 
There is a suggestion of a latent factor � ������ �� ����� ������� ������ - in 
orthopaedic and TBI groups which might confer risk for crime. However, there is 
marked variation in the measures used for TBI across these studies. The Finnish 
study used data from health records - with high levels of sensitivity and specificity - 
whilst the SWE study relied on 2 self and carer reports of Mild TBI. As such, the 
former included moderate to severe injury � which is more likely to be associated 
with problem behaviour in the long term -  whilst the latter included only mild injury 
- with less significant, life changing, consequence.

on Studies: 
Broadly consistent findings, in 4 major data-
linkage studies, have indicated that TBI does increase criminality. Although some pre-
injury characteristics remain important predictors of crime.(46) In Northern Finland, 
adolescents admitted to psychiatric care who had had a TBI were at increased risk of 
  
7 
���� ������������ ����-fold) conduct disorder (5.7-fold) and concomitant criminality 
and conduct disorder (18.7-fold) compared to those with no TBI.(47) They had also 
committed significantly more violent (42.9% vs. 9.1%) and non-violent crimes (29.4% 
vs. 6.8%) crimes.   However, reverse causality was possible. One of the most 
compelling studies indicating a risk of crime post-TBI is a 35 year, retrospective, total 
population study of Swedes (48). Fazel and colleagues found that 2.3% of the 
population controls had committed violent crimes. In contrast, of TBI cases (a total of 
22,914), 8.8% had committed violent crimes. This corresponded to a substantially 
increased risk of violent crime in the TBI population ��������� ���� ����� ��O‘� � ���� 
��� CI� ��������� ‘��� ��� ���������� ���� ����� ���� �������� ���� ���������� 
�������� ��O‘ � ���� �������� 
� ��� ����� ���� shared similar genetic, social and 
economic backgrounds. Sibling controls were also examined in a retrospective cohort 
data linkage study in Western Australia.(49) Hospital recorded cases of TBI (n=7,694) 
were compared to matched cohort (n=22,905) and full sibling controls. TBI was 
associated with increased risk for all offending in males (HR = 1·6 CI 1.46 to 1.72) and 
females (HR = 1·5 CI 1.28 to 1.81). When same-sex full-sibling controls were used in 
the adjusted analyses, increased risk of offending was evident among TBI males only 
(HR = 1·7 CI 1.31-2.18).  For violent convictions, relative to the general community, 
TBI was also associated with increased risk in men (HR = 1·65 CI 1.42 to 1.92) and 
women (HR = 1.73 CI 1.21 to 2.47). Analysis comparing full siblings with, and without, 
TBI, showed that TBI was only associated with violent offending in men (HR = 1.9 CI 
1.20-3.00). In these analyses potential confounders (aboriginal background, substance 
abuse, social disadvantage etc.) were controlled for.  A recent large scale data-linkage 
cohort study of 1.4 Million Ontarian adults also indicated that TBI is linked to more 
serious offending.(50) Data on persons aged 18-28 who attended Emergency 
Departments were linked to records from correctional services. Incarceration was to 
federal facility for (likely for more serious or chronic offending).  Hazard ratio analyses 
showed that TBI � in men and women - was associated with a subsequent HR 2.5 (CI: 
2.2-2.8) increased risk of incarceration. Potential confounding factors were controlled 
for in models (e.g. socio-economic, substance misuse, psychiatric disorder etc.). In 
contrast, a prospective cohort study with 6315 adult participants (which reduced to N 
= 2690 at 5 years post injury), from a US based TBI Model System National Database, 
  
8 
found that Premorbid variables, especially pre-TBI offending, were strongly linked to 
post-TBI arrests (46). Higher numbers of post-TBI arrests were, though, predicted by 
loss of consciousness (�24 hours) combined with retention of motor functions. 
Participants had Moderate to Severe TBI (greater than 30 minutes LOC) and were 
predominantly over age 25 years of age. A stage of life less likely to be a risk period 
for crime. That the participants had been in a TBI model system might have had a 
protective effect on behaviour. 
 
TBI may be, at the ���� ������ � ��������� �������� ��� � ����� �� ������ ���� �������� 
a risk for crime. Furthermore, considering the range of evidence, across age groups, 
populations, and jurisdictions, these studies indicate that TBI is an independent risk 
factor for crime. In the very young it may lead to later drug and alcohol misuse, 
which, in turn, increases chances of crime. In those injured after 5, including adults, 
TBI appears linked to increased likelihood of offending. However, established 
criminogenic risk factors are still important. TBI may add to greater risk of criminality 
by increasing likelihood for problem behaviour and eroding capacity for self-
regulation and socialisation.   
 
TBI Prevalence studies in Offender Populations:   
In this section we examine the prevalence, and associated features, of TBI in 
offenders. In particular, how TBI may be linked to neuropsychological problems, 
mental health and drug and alcohol misuse issues, poor response to forensic 
rehabilitation, and recidivism. 
 
Presence of neurological abnormalities: 
There have been two recent CT and MRI 
neuroimaging studies in adults in Germany indicating higher levels of brain anomalies 
in offenders. Schiltz et al, in a study of 287 male prison inmates, found that violent 
prisoners had significantly more morphological abnormalities than non-violent 
prisoners or controls (42% in violent prisoners vs. 26% vs. 8 % respectively).(51) They 
noted how the areas affected in the violent offenders were those typically associated 
with empathy. Witzel et al (52) found half of  148 patients in a secure mental health 
institution displayed signs of brain pathology compared to 8 % in non-criminal 
  
9 
controls. We note these studies were with highly selective samples, and causes of 
lesions were not known. We cannot know whether being violent led to injury or vice 
versa. 
 
Youth populations: 
In incarcerated young people TBI appears to be prevalent and 
linked to greater risk of violence. However, there are important co-morbid and 
adversity related factors that are criminogenic.  Adversity could relate to trauma, 
severe economic disadvantage, parental loss, abuse and neglect.(53)   
 
In a meta-analysis of studies of TBI in juvenile offenders 9 studies were identified. (11) 
The rate of TBI (with a history of LOC) across 9 studies was approximately 30%. This is 
high relative to the general population. In the five studies that used a control group a 
summary odds ratio of 3.37 was calculated, which suggests that juvenile offenders are 
significantly more likely to have a TBI compared to controls.  
 
There are few studies on severity of TBI, comorbid conditions, and patterns of crime. 
Williams et al. assessed 197 young incarcerated male offenders (average age 16) - 
60% reported a ����� �������.(54) There was a LOC in 46% of the sample, and 16% 
reported Moderate or Severe TBI (defined as LOC for 10 minutes to 6 hours or 6 
hours or more).(55)  The main cause of injury was violence. Three or more TBIs was 
associated with greater violence. TBI was linked to mental health problems, misuse of 
cannabis, and more convictions.  In a related study Davies et al. found that 
complicated MTBI (LOC of 10 to 30 minutes, or repeated injury) was associated with 
greater degree of on-going PCS symptoms (forgetting, headaches etc.) � controlling 
for drug and alcohol misuse.  LOC history was correlated with younger age of first 
conviction (12 vs. 13 years). Similarly, in the USA, Peron and Howard found that 18% 
of 720 inmates (average age 15.5)  had TBIs where they were unconscious for more 
than 20 minutes.(56)  Male gender, psychiatric diagnosis, and earlier onset of criminal 
behaviour and substance use were associated with brain injury.  
 
Adversity and co-morbid issues, when assessed, are very common in young offenders.  
Chitsabesan et al. reported a study with incarcerated adolescents in England (93 boys 
  
10 
aged 15 to 18 years). Eighty-two percent reported a TBI and 18% had moderate-
severe current post-concussion symptoms.(57) Those with Moderate to Severe TBI� 
(TBI) compared and No or Mild TBI (NoM TBI) - reported common comorbid issues: 
ADHD (29% of TBI: 20% of NoM TBI); speech and language impairments (TBI 36%: 
NoM TBI 41%); and alcohol (TBI 71%: NoM TBI 58%) and cannabis misuse problems 
(TBI 86%: NoM TBI 84%). However, the TBI group were significantly more likely to 
have previously been in care (64% vs 34%), and be at current risk of deliberate self-
harm (57% vs. 43%) and suicidality (50% vs. 24%). A study by Vaughn and colleagues 
in the USA with ������������ ������������ �n = 1345, aged on average 16, mostly 
(86%) male), also found that those with TBI had higher scores for a range of co-
morbid issues - psychopathy, moral disengagement and impulsivity, bullying, peer 
delinquency, violent victimisation and witnessing violence.(58) 
 
Adult Populations: 
 A meta-analysis of lifetime prevalence of TBI in incarcerated 
adults versus general population indicate that it is significantly higher in the 
offenders.(59) The un-weighted pooled prevalence for TBI across 5049 subjects in 24 
studies was 51.1%.  Both males and females groups were affected. There also appears 
to be a ���������� effect. In a study in the USA, for example, on the lifetime 
prevalence of TBI in prisoners  65% of males and 72% of females reported one TBI 
with �alteration of consciousness��(60)  Longer LOC was associated with more 
symptoms. In the UK, of 200 adult male prisoners, 60% reported a TBI of some 
form.(61) Moderate to severe TBI (LOC of 10 minutes or more) was reported by 
16.6%. Those with a self-reported history of TBI were, on average, five years younger 
at the age of first prison sentence than uninjured (age 16 compared to 21) and had 
higher rates of reconviction. Schofield and colleagues, who examined 200 men in 
custody (aged 30), and 200 non- offenders (aged 43) in the community � from a 
matched (by residence) background - found that TBI was more common among 
prisoners (82% vs 72%).(62) There was also a higher proportion of prisoners with 
histories of LOC (65% vs 35%).  Prisoners also had more multiple TBIs (42% vs 15%). 
Assault was the most common cause of injury in prisoners whilst sporting injury was 
in the community sample. The offender group also reported significantly greater 
ongoing psychological effects of injury, such as headaches, memory problems and 
  
11 
anger.  This pattern suggests a history of TBI involving high speed mechanisms and 
actual brain changes in offenders. 
 
This theme � of consequential injury - is consistent with a trend for prisoners with TBI 
to have been shown to have greater levels of neuropsychological deficits and 
treatment failure. Pitman and colleagues compared 139 male prisoners with �� �no 
TBI� ������ ��������� (63) They found no differences for premorbid intellectual 
functions. However, those with TBI were worse on current functions � particularly 
executive skills. Severity of TBI was associated with greater impairment. The TBI group 
had greater prevalence of violent crime (60.4% vs 38.0%). Fishbein and colleagues

and colleagues, in a US state-wide study over 11 years using linked hospital and 
justice data sets of 17,569 inmates, found that males and females with TBI had 
significantly higher rates of violent infractions.(65)  Ray and Richardson conducted a 
longitudinal, prospective, follow up study of 151 inmates released from incarceration 
during a period of 12 to 30 months.(66) At 12 months post release 63% of those 
without TBI had not recidivated, whilst 48% of TBI had not. The TBI group had a 
regression model hazard rate of 1.57 greater than non-TBI for recidivism.  
 
TBI, as we have seen, occurs within a constellation of socio-adversity factors. This is a 
particularly evident in studies with girls and women. Of 113 female prisoners in the 
USA, Brewer-Smyth et al. found that 42% had TBI histories, and those who had 
committed violent offences had suffered an average of two TBIs.(67) Domestic abuse, 
prior suicide attempts, and traumatic brain injuries with LOC, were all associated with 
current violent convictions. Similarly, Colantonio et al.  found that females with TBI 
  
12 
who offend had suffered more early physical and sexual abuse than those without 
TBI.(68) Abuse, of various forms, could be associated with concussive blows and/or 
TBIs. Such injuries may complicate the experience of PTSD � with survivors having 
patchy recall of events.(69)

The Centre for Mental Health recently conducted an analysis of the cost of TBI, 
including costs relating to crime(3). Calculations were based on cases of TBI with 
hospital admission (classified as mild or moderate).  Modest likelihood risk ratios were 
used to predict the additional risk of offending post-TBI.  On average, in a person 
representative of the general population age 15, the lifetime costs of TBI would be 
around £155,000 per case, including £95,000 for non-crime costs (health care, lost 
earnings etc.) and £60,000 for the costs of additional offending.  For a young person 
already in the criminal justice system, the lifetime costs increase to around £345,000 
per case, reflecting the much higher costs in those already on a likely trajectory into 
persistent offending. 
 
Opportunities for change 
There are a range of measures that could reduce the risk of crime following TBI. First, 
any form of neuro-rehabilitation could offset the risk of violent crime.(70) Second, 
improved linkage between Emergency Departments, Community Mental Health 
Services (CAMHs), GPs and school systems might lead to early identification 
management of TBI in children and young people, particularly in lower socio-
economic areas. This may reduce chances of school exclusion and social isolation. 
Third, �� � �������� entry into the justice system (police, courts, or admission to 
probation or secure care) there is an opportunity to deliver routine screening for TBI 
and provision of treatment options.  Indeed, for young people in courts in UK there is 
now recognition that TBI should be taken into account in sentencing.(71) There are 
initiatives in England that allow screening for Neuro-disability in entrants into youth 
secure estate. There have also been pilot projects to assess for TBI and other NDs in 
  
13 
young adults and adult prisons.(63) (72) Fourth, provision of Brain Injury link-workers 
within prisons to enable screening and support for those with TBI, and training and 
support for staff, has been shown possible and beneficial.(57) Through such initiatives 
forensic rehabilitation could be enhanced with interventions to manage the cognitive 
and behavioural issues stemming from TBI. One illustration of how this might work is 
in a non-TBI study where medication for attention deficit hyperactivity disorder in 
offenders led to a 30% reduction in criminality on release - possibly owing to 
improved impulse control. (73) In the UK Parliamentary bodies have noted the need 
to take account of TBI in the CJS.  [INSERT BOXES 3 & 4].(74, 75)

The causal mechanism that link TBI and crime are unclear. It may be supposed that 
having a TBI would typically lead to � or exacerbate - problems in behavioural self-
regulation and mood. For example, aggressive behaviour has been shown to be 
increased after TBI but also pre-TBI aggression is also a risk factor for post-TBI 
aggression.(76) Higher quality research is needed to explicate these links whilst 
accounting for the various factors that may confound this association.   
It is clearly important to address some of the weaknesses in studies reviewed. Birth 
cohort, data-linkage and prevalence studies lack agreed definitions or criteria for 
identifying TBI. In many studies there are ������ �������� �������������� of presence or 
absence of TBI, and often there is no measure of injury severity. Furthermore 
measures of crime are often limited (e.g. only the type of sentence given). Studies 
also tend to be cross-sectional and lack verified medical records. They rarely have 
non-offending control groups.  Although it is worth noting that one study with young 
offenders used self-reports and medical records and found that rates of injury were 
consistent. (57) Whilst, similarly, one study with adults found 70% agreement 
between self-reported and medically recorded TBI. (77) However, future research is 
needed with prospective, longitudinal, designs, with well validated and agreed TBI 
criteria. They should also have appropriate controls groups with measures of actual 
criminal behaviour � such as from police records.  
 
  
14 
It is particularly important that future studies are designed to characterise the nature 
and severity of neuro-trauma in offenders versus controls. Ideally there should be 
neuroimaging, such as Diffusion Tensor Imaging, alongside measurement of chronic 
TBI biomarkers such as Tau.(78) Such analyses would allow a better understanding of 
the underlying pathology of TBI within offenders and offer windows for novel 
treatment options to be developed.(79)  
 
Given the high levels of pre-injury developmental adversity, co-morbid neuro-
disability, and mental ill-health in the populations studied, it is vital to establish how 
much of current functioning and behaviour is determined by TBI and/or these other 
factors.(80)  Of particular importance is a need to explicate how TBI is situated within 
the criminogenic life histories of offenders. Crucially offenders often report 
childhoods characterised by h���� ������ ������������ ��������� ��� �����

Given the enormous population of the CJS it would be important to determine what 
forms of screening could be done quickly and reliably (at arrest, court, prison, release, 
and probation), and how that data can be used to guide interventions.  This should be 
tailored for particular regimes and within specific facilities (e.g. segregation, close 
supervision, or healthcare). The use of sensitive screening tools could generate data 
for linkage (such as through criminal justice, health and education) to identify trends 
in crime in related to TBI. Furthermore, given that TBI appears to increase the 
  
15 
chances of violent crime, it is important that it is taken into account a factor for 
predicting future violence. Scalable tools such as OxRisk currently enable stratification 
of prisoners into high, medium and low risk groups.(89) Adding TBI as a factor in the 
model may increase predictive accuracy and enable enhanced support plans to 
reduce crime risk.   
 
“������ � C����������� 
TBI appears linked to earlier age of incarceration, greater violence, and more 
convictions. Neurological abnormalities appear common in offenders. Brain functions, 
in areas important for social functions, such as impulse control and empathy, appear 
compromised. In those in custody, complicated Mild TBI and/or moderate to severe 
injury seems likely in 1-2 in 10, whilst another 3 or 4 in 10 may have milder form of 
TBI. Neuropsychological dysfunction is linked to violence, infractions in prison, poorer 
treatment gains and re-conviction. Life histories of abuse, neglect, and trauma appear 
particularly elevated in those with TBI versus control, as are ongoing mental health 
and drug and alcohol problems. Young offenders with TBI are particularly at risk of 
self-harm and suicidal behaviour. TBI could amplify any neuro-cognitive issues due to 
adverse life events. P����� ���� TBI� ��� ������������ �� ���� ���� �� ���������� ���� ���

BOX 2: TBI and risk of psychiatric morbidity 
 
Systematic reviews and large cohort studies have identified that psychiatric morbidity 
is high in individuals with TBI, with some finding that TBI increases risk.(90)  
 
A 2009 review reported that depression was increased after a TBI, but that the 
information for other psychiatric disorders was limited.(91)  
 
Another review has reported rates of PTSD in 5-7% of individuals with mild TBIs. 
(92)  
 
Since these reviews, high quality cohort studies have been conducted and found 
increased risk of new psychiatric disorders, including PTSD, panic disorder, social 
phobia, and agoraphobia, with 22% of individuals have new diagnoses. (93) 
 
Other relevant research has been conducted in the US, where risk of incident 
psychiatric disorders was increased (relative risk of 2.8, 2.1-3.7)(94) but not for 
schizophrenia in Denmark.(95) A recent large population-based cohort study using 
sibling controls reported new diagnoses of substance use and depression to be 
higher in those with TBIs than sibling controls, and higher risk of premature mortality 
(OR 2.6, 2.3-2.6) and suicide (OR 2.3, 1.9-2.9) compared with siblings who did not 
have diagnoses of any head injury.(96) A recent investigation of all individuals 
identified using healthcare registers who sustained head injuries until the age of 25 in 
Sweden found that risk of any inpatient psychiatric hospitalization (relative risk = 2.0, 
1.9-2.0) and any psychiatric episode (relative risk = 1.5, 1.5-1.6) was higher than 
population controls. These risks were higher when head injury was sustained at older 
ages, and when it was more severe.(97)

 A recent government report outlines a serviced pathway for people with 
brain injury in the criminal justice system in Scotland1 
 The pathway extends from police custody through to probation utilising 
identification and screening to triage to appropriate services 
 Preliminary evidence obtained in the course of the report indicated a four-
fold greater risk of a history of admission to hospital with head injury than in 
matched general population controls 
 A need for specialised secure forensic provision for people with brain injury 
was identified 
 Linkage between brain injury services and the criminal justice service was 
found to be poor 
 A need for effective education and intervention packages was identified
