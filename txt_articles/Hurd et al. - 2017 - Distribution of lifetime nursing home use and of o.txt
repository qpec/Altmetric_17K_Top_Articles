Reliable estimates of the lifetime risk of using a nursing home and
the associated out-of-pocket costs are important for the saving
decisions by individuals and families, and for the purchase of long-
term care insurance. We used data on up to 18 y of nursing home
use and out-of-pocket costs drawn from the Health and Retire-
ment Study, a longitudinal household survey representative of the
older US population. We accumulated the use and spending by
individuals over many years, and we developed and used an
individual-level matching method to account for use before and
after the observation period. In addition, for forecasting, we
estimated a dynamic parametric model of nursing home use and
spending. We found that 56% of persons aged 57–61 will stay at
least one night in a nursing home during their lifetimes, but only
32% of the cohort will pay anything out of pocket. Averaged over
all persons, total out‐of‐pocket expenditures looking forward
from age 57 were approximately $7,300, discounted at 3% per
year. However, the 95th percentile of spending was almost
$47,000. We conclude that the percentage of people ever staying
in nursing homes is substantially higher than previous estimates,
at least partly due to an increase in nursing home episodes of
short duration. Average lifetime out‐of‐pocket costs may be af-
fordable, but some people will incur much higher costs.

eliable estimates of the lifetime risk of nursing home use and
of the associated out-of-pocket costs are important to indi-
viduals and households in deciding whether to purchase long-
term care insurance and how much to save. They are also im-
portant to firms that sell such insurance, and to policymakers
who may take action should risks not be amenable to private-
market amelioration. The website longtermcare.acl.gov states
that the risk of 65-y-olds entering a nursing facility sometime in
their life is 35%, and the risk of entering any care facility is 37%
(2). This figure is consistent with many others in the literature
(3–6), but lower than the projections of Spillman and Lubitz (7)
(45% projected for people reaching age 65 in 2010). Because of
data limitations, prior estimates have been based on cross-
section data or on short panel datasets that necessitate model-
ing transitions into and out of nursing homes. The models re-
quire numerous assumptions and often combine data from several
sources with the attendant risks of variation in both data quality and
populations covered. Furthermore, many published studies have
used data from the 1980s or earlier, but there have been substantial
changes in nursing home use over the last several decades, most
notably an increase in short stays associated with posthospitalization
rehabilitation (6). These changes have likely led to an increase in
lifetime use and out-of-pocket spending.
The ideal study design follows a cohort as it passes through the
ages of meaningful nursing home use until the death of the last
cohort member, recording use and out-of-pocket spending of each
individual. We use a study design that approaches that ideal: the
Health and Retirement Study (HRS), which follows older indi-
viduals for up to 18 y. It is a single data source that consistently
records nursing home use and out-of-pocket spending, which we
accumulate at the individual level over the observation period,
thus substituting data for model assumptions that have, of ne-
cessity, been used in prior studies. We find that the lifetime fre-
quency of any nursing home use by the cohorts we study is
substantially larger than previous estimates. More importantly, the
distribution of use was highly skewed: Approximately 5% of the
population spent more than 4 y in a nursing home, while the me-
dian person spent just a week or so. Similarly, out-of-pocket
spending on average was not particularly large relative to assets
in late middle age, but it was highly skewed, implying a substantial
risk of large spending. Assuming the experience of past cohorts is a
good guide to the experience of future cohorts, our results suggest
that the lifetime use of nursing homes by individuals in their late 50s
will be substantially higher than current literature predicts.
Methods
The HRS is a biennial longitudinal survey. Appropriately weighted, the sample
represents the US population over age 50. The first wave of the HRS was
conducted in 1992 from cohorts born in 1931–1941 and, thus, the respon-
dents were approximately age 51–61 at initial interview. We use 10 waves
covering 18 y of data on this cohort. In 1993, the HRS interviewed individuals
born in 1923 or earlier. These so-called “AHEAD” cohorts were incorporated
into the HRS proper in 1998. We use 12 y of data on them. See SI Appendix
for additional information about the HRS and for details of the analyses
presented in this paper.
The HRS collects information on residence in a nursing home at interview,
as well as move-in date and detailed, self-reported information about nursing
home use between waves, including number of nursing home episodes and
total nursing home nights. Respondents are asked whether the costs of the
nursing home stay(s) were covered by insurance and about costs they paid
out-of-pocket. The HRS conducts “exit interviews” with a knowledgeable
informant in the wave following the death of an HRS interviewee. Because
of the intensity of nursing home use in the months preceding death, the exit
Significance
Although it is important to know the annual costs and use of
nursing homes, for individuals and households, it is also im-
portant to know expected lifetime costs and use of nursing
homes; that is, how much they will use nursing homes and how
much might spend over their lifetimes. They need this information
in deciding how much to save and whether to purchase insurance
that will pay for nursing home use. By following individuals over
many years as they progress to advanced old age, we estimated
how many days individuals will spend in nursing homes and
how much they will spend out-of-pocket.

 interviews are critical for obtaining complete information on lifetime use of
nursing homes and associated out-of-pocket expenditures.
Our main estimation method is nonparametric: We follow individuals in
panel data, recording their nursing home use, spending, and survival.
However, even the long panel of the HRS does not cover a single cohort from
middle age to death. To construct a trajectory of nursing home use from age
57 to the end of life, we select a core cohort, individuals initially ages 75–79 in
1998 (born 1919–1923). The survivors reached ages 87–91 in 2010. To ac-
count for right censoring (nursing home use to be incurred by survivors after
2010), we match each surviving individual to a similar individual from an
older cohort where the matching is on age, sex, and on position in the
distribution of out-of-pocket spending on nursing home use. The objective
of this matching is to impute use and spending following the observation
period while preserving heterogeneity in the persistence of spending. For
survivors to 2010 who did not provide a 2010 interview, we apply the same
matching algorithm using information from the latest available HRS in-
terview. To account for left censoring (nursing home use incurred before
1998 by individuals in our core cohort), we perform a similar match to in-
dividuals from younger cohorts. Following this matching, we have complete
histories of nursing home use and associated out-of-pocket spending by the
cohort born in 1919–1923 from ages 57 to 61 to the end of life, conditional
on survival to ages 75–79. We augment these data with nursing home use
and out-of-pocket spending of those who died before ages 75–79 to gen-
erate data on the nursing home use and spending of a complete cohort from
age 57 until death.
For comparisons with existing literature, and for forecasting, we also
estimate a parametric model of the probability of any nursing home use
between waves, which lie 2 y apart on average. We distinguish four individual
outcomes since the preceding wave: (i) alive, no nursing home use; (ii) alive,
with nursing home use; (iii) died, no nursing home use; and (iv) died, with
nursing home use. We estimate multinomial logit models for the probability
of each outcome, and conditional on nursing home use, the amount of use
and associated out-of-pocket spending. An important explanatory variable is
nursing home use in two preceding waves, which captures persistence in use.
Additional explanatory variables are age, sex, education, race, marital status
at age 50, number of children, any daughters, and ever a smoker. After
estimating these models using the same single data source as the non-
parametric approach, we simulate lifetime nursing home use and out-of-
pocket spending until death for a representative sample of 50- to 55-y-
olds from the HRS, generating a distribution of predicted lifetime outcomes.
The research reported in this paper uses publicly available, deidentified
data. The research was reviewed and approved by the RAND Human Subjects
Protection Committee, which serves as RAND’s Institutional Review Board.
Results
Accumulated Nursing Home Use Across Panel Waves. To illustrate
the strength of the HRS data, we first present data on nursing
home use directly accumulated from raw data, not adjusted for
left or right censoring. Conditional on reaching 75–79, 48.3% of
the core cohort (Table 1) had some nursing home use between
1998 and 2010. By 2010, 35% of the core cohort was alive and
might experience further nursing home use. We accumulated
out-of-pocket spending discounted to age 57 by using a 3%
discount rate to permit a comparison with wealth at an early age
when there has been little nursing home use. Out-of-pocket
spending averaged $5,253 expressed in 2013 prices.
We performed similar calculations for the birth cohorts 1905–
1911, 1912–1918, and 1931–1936. The first cohorts aged from
87–93 to 99–105 over the 12 y of the HRS that we used. Some
72% of that cohort had nursing home use; out-of-pocket
spending averaged $11,596, in 2013 prices discounted to age
57. The second set of cohorts aged from 80–86 to 92–88 over
the 12-y period. Approximately 64% had any nursing home use,
with average out-of-pocket spending amounting to $8,305 in
2013 prices discounted to age 57. The 1931–1936 cohorts were
age 56–61 at baseline in 1992 and were followed for up to 18 y.
Fifteen percent of them had nursing home use; average out-of-
pocket spending accumulated over the 18 y was approximately
$1,100. See SI Appendix, Table S2) for details.
Lifetime Nursing Home Use. To account for left and right censor-
ing, we linked surviving individuals from our central cohort
(Table 1) to individuals from the younger and older cohorts. We
added data on individuals who died before the initial ages of our
core cohort (before ages 75–79) to form a complete dataset on
individuals from their late 50s to their deaths. Table 2 shows the
estimated lifetime nursing home use and discounted out-of-
pocket spending. Fifty-six percent of persons from the cohorts
of 1919–1923 who survived to ages 57–61 had or will have at least
one night in a nursing home over the course of their lifetimes.
The average is 272 nights, but the distribution is highly skewed:
The median is just 10 nights, but the 90th percentile is 1,001 nights
and the 95th percentile is 1,495 nights. Thus, someone age 57–61 has
a 10% chance of spending 3 y or more in a nursing home and a 5%
chance of spending more than 4 y.
Although 56% of the population had a nursing home stay, just
32% paid anything out-of-pocket, implying that approximately
43% of those with a nursing home stay were completely covered
by insurance, private or more likely, public. Accumulated life-
time out-of-pocket spending was $7,344 in 2013 dollars dis-
counted to age 57. As with nursing home nights, out-of-pocket
spending is highly skewed: 5% of persons in that cohort spent an
amount approaching $50,000 or more.
These results do not distinguish the length of a nursing home
episode, which is of interest for at least two reasons. First, a long
stay may impact the well-being of individuals and their families
differently from multiple short stays. Second, in some cases, the
financial liability differs by length of stay: Medicare fully pays for
20 d of rehabilitative nursing home use following hospitalization
and partially for the following days up to 100 d. Therefore, we
define a long stay to be an episode greater than 100 d. We es-
timate that 27.0% of individuals age 57 will have a long nursing
home stay. Of those with a long stay, approximately one-half
(48.7%) will have just one long episode, but approximately one-
fourth (27.1%) will have three or more long episodes.

 Forecasts of Nursing Home Use and Associated Out-of-Pocket
Spending. Based on the estimated parametric model, we simu-
lated the lifetime experience of a representative sample drawn
from HRS, and we accumulated nursing home use and out-of-
pocket spending from ages 57 to 61 to the end of life. The
predicted probability of any nursing home use (Table 3) is very
close to the predicted probability from the nonparametric ap-
proach (Table 2), and the distributions are similar with over-
lapping confidence intervals in the lower part of the distribution
(up to and including the 75th percentile). However, the non-
parametric estimation of the average number of nights is some
47 d greater than the parametric estimation due to a fatter upper
tail of the distribution: The 95th percentile is approximately
350 d greater. Thus, the risk (the chances of an extreme out-
come) as estimated nonparametrically is substantially greater
than the risk as estimated by the model, although the model uses
up to 6 y of longitudinal data to capture persistence in use. This
difference is likely due to the model being a simplification of the
more complex actual process.
The parametric estimates of out-of-pocket spending are sim-
ilar to the nonparametric, but with a lower mean due to smaller
values at the highest percentiles.
Using individual simulated lifetime nursing home use and
spending based on the models, we analyzed variation in use and
spending by individual characteristics (Table 4). The lifetime risk
of nursing home use (starting from ages 57 to 61) by females is
64%, considerably higher than for males. The number of nursing
home nights and out-of-pocket spending are approximately
double those of males. These differences result from greater
survival on the part of women, so they are exposed to more years
of risk, and, at advanced ages, often lack spouses to provide care.
Whites and nonwhites have similar nursing home use, but whites
spend considerably more out-of-pocket because they have more
economic resources and are less likely to qualify for Medicaid.
The better educated have modestly greater use, but spend much
more out-of-pocket because they also have greater economic
resources. Having children, especially daughters, provides a re-
source that could keep an older person in the community. There
is little association between the number of children and the
lifetime risk of using a nursing home, but the association with
lifetime nursing home nights and out-of-pocket is substantial:
For example, those with four or more children will spend ap-
proximately 38% less than those with no children. Having
daughters reduces spending further, but it is not associated with
the lifetime risk of nursing home use. Thus, children reduce
lifetime use by slowing the transition into a nursing home or
hastening the transition out, but they have little, if any, effect on
whether someone uses a nursing home over the lifespan. Because
of shorter lifetimes, smokers, whether active or previous at age
50, have less nursing home use than those who never smoked.
Discussion
Lifetime Risk of Nursing Home Use. Our estimate of lifetime nursing
home use by the birth cohorts 1919–1923 is 56%, considerably
larger than previous estimates, which use data on a variety of
cohorts. To find an estimate for a similar birth cohort, we look to
Kemper and Murtaugh (3), who project the lifetime nursing
home risk of those turning age 65 in 1990 (the birth cohort of
1925) to be 43%.
Because of substantial differences in methods and data, it is
difficult to locate the causes of the differences from prior esti-
mates. Some studies used recall data from the deceased’s next-
of-kin, others used surveys of older populations with differing
degrees of follow-up. Three features of our data are likely

 important. First, we use seven waves of biennial longitudinal data
on our core cohort as they pass through years of high nursing
home use and mortality. Thus, the data permit direct calculations
of the bulk of nursing home use and out-of-pocket spending.
Studies based on cross-sections or short panels require modeling
and assumptions about data processes that we can mostly avoid
in the nonparametric approach. Further, these studies combine
data from various sources, which increases concern about re-
liability and whether each source pertains to the same pop-
ulation. In contrast, the HRS data are from one source with a
longitudinally consistent survey design and elicitation methods.
Second, the HRS data have relatively short recall periods for
nursing home use—averaging two years—reducing recall error.
Third, the exit interview data account for a considerable frac-
tion of nursing home use: Ignoring them reduces the esti-
mated lifetime risk of any nursing home use to 36%—similar to
literature estimates.
The type of nursing home use included may account for dif-
ferences. Kemper et al. (6) found that 35% of those turning 65 in
2005 would use a nursing home at some time in their remaining
lifetimes. However, their study excluded posthospitalization re-
habilitative care, which is fully or partially paid for by Medicare
up to 100 d. We include such care because if an episode lasts
beyond 20 d, an individual is responsible for substantial and
possibly consequential copays: out-of-pocket costs for days 21–
100 would accumulate to $13,160 per episode. To ascertain
whether our inclusion of short stays can account for the differ-
ence, we analyzed a subsample (88.8% of cases) where we could
confidently measure the duration of episode length, namely
when there were zero or one episode in any HRS wave. Over 14 y
of HRS data, the percentage of this sample with any nursing
home use was 44.1%; excluding episodes of less than 22 d re-
duced this to 29.9%. While we cannot repeat this analysis for the
entire sample because we do not know episode length when
there was more than one episode, the results for the subsample
strongly suggest that our higher lifetime risk is at least partially
due to short stays. Furthermore, the incidence of episodes of less
than 22 d (short stays) appears to be increasing over time:
Comparing HRS 1998 with HRS 2010, we find that among those
with one episode, 28.1% had a short stay in 1998 and 33.9% had
a short stay in 2010. Compared with earlier studies, our use of
more recent data is partially responsible for estimating a higher
level of nursing home use.
Lifetime Out-of-Pocket Spending on Nursing Homes. From the per-
spective of a 57-y-old, average rest-of-lifetime out-of-pocket
spending ($7,344) is a small fraction (less than 10%) of mean
financial wealth, as observed in multiple waves of HRS data. A
forward-looking household could set aside this amount of money
at age 57, and at the assumed real rate of return of 3%, would be
able to pay for average out-of-pocket spending on nursing home
use. However, this comparison does not account for a number of
difficulties. First, these figures relate to mean wealth and mean
out-of-pocket spending, but due to the skewed distribution of
wealth, median financial wealth at age 57 would be depleted by
setting aside this amount. Second, there is substantial risk: the
95th percentile of lifetime out-of-pocket spending is approxi-
mately $47,000. Third, the dollar amounts assume discounting of
3% real, but some households may not be able to achieve that
(high) real rate of return. Discounting at a zero real rate of
return, which may be more realistic, yields higher present values:
Average expected cost would be $18,000; the 95th percentile
would be $115,000. Fourth, the figures are all on a per-person
basis: The average expected costs for a couple would be ap-
proximately twice as great.
Our estimate of average out-of-pocket spending is consider-
ably less than that of Kemper et al. (6): $12,100 (in 2005 prices)
among those surviving to age 65 in 2005, discounted to age 65 at
3% real. Putting their figure in 2013 prices and discounting to
age 57 brings it to $11,400 compared with our $7,344 (non-
parametric) or $6,201 (parametric). In our most comparable
model-based estimate, we assume stationary in processes, and
convert to 2013 prices by the actual historical consumer price
index. Kemper et al. assume 3% general price inflation and an
additional 1.3% inflation in the long-term care sector. Over a
40-y time horizon, the assumption of inflation in nursing home

“No. of nights in nursing home” means average nights spent in a nursing home over the lifetime beginning at
ages 57–61. “Spending” means lifetime out-of-pocket spending on nursing homes discounted to age 57 at a 3%
real interest rate, expressed in 2013 dollars. “Lower” and “Upper” mean the lower and upper bounds of the 95%
confidence intervals. “Characteristics” are recorded at age 50, e.g., “smoker” means an individual was or had
been a smoker at age 50.

 prices in excess of general price inflation makes a considerable
difference: It is equivalent to reducing the real discount factor by
1.3 percentage points, that is, from 3 to 1.7%. When we discount
by 1.7%, our estimated lifetime out-of-pocket spending becomes
$10,695, which is 94% of the adjusted figure in Kemper et al. (6).
Limitations. The HRS data on nursing home stays and spending
are based on self-reports, which might potentially be biased. We
compared estimates from the HRS of the average number of
nursing home nights and average out-of-pocket spending with
estimates derived from external data. We found that average
nights reported in HRS were approximately 5% lower, and that
HRS out-of-pocket spending was, at most, 12% lower than our
calculations based on CMS National Health Expenditure data
and MetLife data (8, 9). See SI Appendix for details. Our findings
would not be materially changed by such errors.
A second possible limitation is that in the nonparametric
analysis in some cases, we combined individual-level data from
two or three different respondents based on our matching
method. Because nursing home use is particularly intense at the
end of life, the matching method could lead to incorrect esti-
mates of the probabilities of extremely long stays. We in-
vestigated the effects of matching by artificially discarding data
on a subpopulation where we had completed, lifetime nursing
home use, and reassigning data based on our matching algo-
rithm. We found that the matching method produced data that
were similar to the actual data. See SI Appendix for details. We
are also reassured by the similarity between the nonparametric
results and the model results, which do not require matching.
A third limitation concerns extrapolation from older to pro-
spective cohorts, requiring an assumption of stationary in un-
derlying processes. Looking at trends across cohorts, Spillman
and Lubitz (7) conclude that the main driver of differences be-
tween cohorts in lifetime nursing home use is greater longevity,
while changes in patterns of use of nursing homes appear
quantitatively less important. They project for people reaching
age 65 in 2000, 2010, and 2020 a lifetime risk of nursing home
entry of 44%, 45%, and 46%, showing the slow pace at which
increases in longevity translate into increases in risk of nursing
home use. Indeed, in the HRS, the rate of nursing home resi-
dence at interview shows little consistent change from 1998 to
2012: Among those 75 or older, 7.4% resided in a nursing home
in 1998; the rate declined until 2008 reaching 6.6%; but in-
creased to 7.7% in 2012. However, as discussed above, there has
been a trend toward more nursing home use and especially short
stays which would not appear in the HRS as residence in a
nursing home: In the event of a short stay, HRS would postpone
the interview until the respondent returned to the community, so
that the respondent would not be recorded as a nursing home
resident. Should the trend toward greater nursing home use
continue, our estimates of lifetime use will be too low. De-
mographic trends are also underway that may affect future
nursing home use. Our central cohort were the parents of the
leading edge of the baby-boom generation, and so they had
several children available for informal care. Indeed, we found a
systematic negative relationship between the number of children
and lifetime nursing home nights and out-of-pocket spending.
Future cohorts will have fewer children, and, to the extent that
nursing home use is a choice (rather than constrained by medical
necessity), they will have more nursing home use. Similarly, the
rise in female labor force participation will reduce the availability
of informal caregivers, also increasing nursing home use.
Conclusion
We conclude that the lifetime risk of any nursing home use is
approximately 56%, substantially higher than prior estimates;
however, a substantial portion of the higher rate is likely due to
an increase in short stays, which have a different impact on
families than long stays. We estimate that 5% of older individ-
uals will experience lengthy stays costing them $47,000 or more
(discounted), and that the lifetime chances of an episode longer
than 100 d are approximately 27%. The risk of high spending
juxtaposed with a moderate mean would seem to call for in-
surance. However, take-up of long-term care insurance is low,
just 10.5% among those age 60 or older (10). One important
reason for this low take-up is that Medicaid provides insurance
of last resort.
