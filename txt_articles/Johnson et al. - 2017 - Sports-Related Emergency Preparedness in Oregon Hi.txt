articipation in high school sports involves an inherent 
risk of catastrophic injury. Although such events are rare, 
institutions must be prepared to respond. Timely care 
decreases the risk of death or permanent disability for the 
athlete, as well as the emotional toll of a young person’s death 
or catastrophic injury on family, friends, and the school 
community. Furthermore, emergency preparation is essential for 
an institution to reduce the risk of litigation for negligence

Background: Best practice recommendations for sports-related emergency preparation include implementation of venue-
specific emergency action plans (EAPs), access to early defibrillation, and first responders—specifically coaches—trained in 
cardiopulmonary resuscitation and automated external defibrillator (AED) use. The objective was to determine whether high 
schools had implemented these 3 recommendations and whether schools with a certified athletic trainer (AT) were more 
likely to have done so.
Hypothesis: Schools with an AT were more likely to have implemented the recommendations.
Study Design: Cross-sectional study.
Level of Evidence: Level 4.
Methods: All Oregon School Activities Association member school athletic directors were invited to complete a survey on 
sports-related emergency preparedness and AT availability at their school. Chi-square and Fisher exact tests were used to 
analyze the associations between emergency preparedness and AT availability.
Results: In total, 108 respondents (37% response rate) completed the survey. Exactly half reported having an AT available. 
Only 11% (95% CI, 6%-19%) of the schools had implemented all 3 recommendations, 29% (95% CI, 21%-39%) had 
implemented 2, 32% (95% CI, 24%-42%) had implemented 1, and 27% (95% CI, 19%-36%) had not implemented any of the 
recommendations. AT availability was associated with implementation of the recommendations  
(χ2 = 10.3, P = 0.02), and the proportion of schools with ATs increased with the number of recommendations implemented 
(χ2 = 9.3, P < 0.01). Schools with an AT were more likely to implement venue-specific EAPs (52% vs 24%, P < 0.01) and 
have an AED available for early defibrillation (69% vs 44%, P = 0.02) but not more likely to require coach training (33% vs 
28%, P = 0.68).
Conclusions: Despite best practice recommendations, most schools were inadequately prepared for sports-related 
emergencies. Schools with an AT were more likely to implement some, but not all, of the recommendations. Policy changes 
may be needed to improve implementation.
Clinical Relevance: Most Oregon high schools need to do more to prepare for sports-related emergencies. The results 
provide evidence for sports medicine professionals and administrators to inform policy changes that ensure the safety of 
athletes.

should a catastrophic event occur.3 To aid preparedness for 
sports-related emergencies, multiple national organizations have 
defined institutional best practices.1,3,4,7
A written emergency action plan (EAP) details the standard of 
care during emergency situations at all venues where 
catastrophic injury can occur.1,3,4,7,15,16 While a number of reports 
exist on EAP adoption by high schools,9,12,14,17,23,25 only 1 
addressed whether EAPs were available at all venues.14
While EAPs define roles and guide appropriate actions for 
emergencies, another key element is the availability of the 
lifesaving equipment to carry out the plan. For instance, it is 
crucial that sudden cardiac arrest is immediately recognized, the 
EAP is activated, and early cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR) 
and rapid defibrillation occur.4,7,19,24 Survival rates after 
ventricular fibrillation decrease 7% to 10% for every minute 
defibrillation is delayed8; hence, access to an automated 
external defibrillator (AED) is essential. While many researchers 
have documented AED presence on campus,10,12,14,17,21,23,25 only 
2 studies specifically examined AED availability for early 
defibrillation.14,23
Finally, the availability of trained individuals is essential for 
execution of the EAP. Ideally, the institution would have an 
onsite healthcare professional, such as an athletic trainer (AT), 
available to provide care during all sports-related emergencies as 
well as to assist the institution plan for emergency situations. 
While many advocate for an AT be present at least at high-risk 
sports events in case of emergency,3,5,16 only 70% of high schools 
nationally provide any form of AT services to student-athletes.18 
Additionally, even in schools with an AT, he or she will not 
always be available for immediate emergency care because of 
multiple teams practicing at various times and locations. In these 
cases, persons such as other team members, administrators, or 
spectators could provide emergency care, but in the majority of 
instances, a coach will most likely serve in this role. Therefore, it 
has been advocated that all coaches be trained in CPR and AED 
use.3 However, a review of state high school activities association 
websites found that only 40% of schools require coaches to be 
CPR-certified, and even fewer require AED training.
The foundation of emergency preparation includes having  
(1) a detailed response plan (EAP) ready, (2) life-saving 
equipment—specifically an AED—available, and (3) coaches 
trained in CPR and AED use. Having all 3 elements coordinated 
together should improve immediate care and result in better 
patient outcomes. Therefore, the purpose of this study was to 
determine the proportion of high schools in Oregon that had 
implemented these 3 best-practice components of emergency 
planning and whether implementation was associated with AT 
presence in a given school.
Methods
This study used a cross-sectional design to assess AT availability 
and sports-related emergency preparedness in Oregon high 
schools. The study was classified “exempt” by the Oregon State 
University Institutional Review Board.
In February 2014, email invitations were sent to all 292 
Oregon School Activities Association member school athletic 
directors (ADs) inviting them to complete a web-based survey 
(Qualtrics, LLC) on their school’s planning for athletic 
emergencies. Follow-up invitations were sent in March and 
April. The survey was developed to assess implementation of 
published emergency planning recommendations.1,3 Survey 
content is detailed in Supplementary Table 1 (available at http://
journals.sagepub.com/doi/suppl/10.1177/1941738116686782).
There were 3 binary outcomes. To be considered to have met best 
practice recommendations, ADs had to answer that (1) venue-
specific EAPs were available, (2) the school had an AED available 
for early defibrillation at all athletic venues, and (3) coaches were 
required to complete training in both CPR and AED use.
Descriptive statistics are reported as proportions with 95% CIs. 
A chi-square (χ2) test was used to analyze the association 
between overall emergency planning best practices and AT 
availability in Oregon high schools. Individual elements of the 
best practice recommendations (ie, 2 × 2 contingency tables) 
were analyzed using Fisher exact tests. Statistical significance 
was set a priori to P ≤ 0.05. All analyses were performed in 
RStudio (version 0.99.486).
Results
A total of 108 (37%) ADs completed the survey. Of these, 
exactly half reported their school had an AT available, but just 
10 of the 54 schools reported having an AT available for 40 or 
more hours per week.
Only 11% (95% CI, 6%-19%) of the schools met all 3 best 
practice recommendations, while 30% (95% CI, 21%-40%) had 
implemented 2, 32% (95% CI, 24%-42%) of schools 1, and 27% 
(95% CI, 19%-36%) of schools had not implemented any. 
Schools with an AT available were more likely to have 
implemented the best practice recommendations (χ2 = 10.3, P = 
0.016), and the proportion of schools with ATs increased with 
the number of recommendations adopted (χ2 = 9.3, P = 0.002) 
(Supplementary Figure 1, available at http://journals.sagepub 
.com/doi/suppl/10.1177/1941738116686782).
Only 38% (95% CI, 29%-48%) of ADs reported that their 
school had venue-specific EAPs. AT availability was associated 
with EAP adoption (P = 0.005). Specifically, 52% (95% CI, 
38%-66%) of schools with an AT had venue-specific EAPs for all 
venues, whereas only 24% (95% CI, 14%-38%) of schools 
without an AT had them (Supplementary Figure 2).
AEDs were available within 4 minutes at all venues in 56% 
(95% CI, 47%-66%) of schools, at some venues in 37% (95% CI, 
28%-47%) of schools, and there was no AED in 6% of schools 
(95% CI, 3%-13%). There was a significant association between 
AT availability at the school and availability of AEDs for early 
defibrillation at all venues (P = 0.019). Specifically, 69% (95% CI, 
54%-80%) of schools with an AT had AEDs available in all 
venues in contrast to only 44% (95% CI, 31%-59%) of schools 
without an AT (Supplementary Figure 3). All schools with an AT 
had at least 1 AED available on campus.

Both CPR and AED training were required for coaches in 31% 
(95% CI, 22%-40%) of schools. No significant association existed 
between AT availability and whether a school required coaches 
to be trained (P = 0.677); 33% (95% CI, 22%-48%) of schools 
with an AT and 28% (95% CI, 17%-42%) of schools without an 
AT required coaches to have CPR and AED training 
(Supplementary Figure 4).
discussion
Most Oregon high schools were not fully prepared for sports-
related emergencies, with just more than 10% implementing all 
3 of the best practice recommendations and nearly 30% not 
implementing any. Although AT services were available at just 
half of the schools, their presence was associated with increased 
adoption of best practice recommendations, including venue-
specific EAPs and AED availability.
Emergency Action Plan Implementation
Although multiple organizations advocate implementing venue-
specific EAPs, only 38% of responding schools had done so. This 
finding is lower than previous reports of EAP implementation in 
high schools,9,12,14,17,23,25 most likely because the survey asked 
specifically about having EAPs for all athletic venues. However, 
it is greater than a previous report that reported 13% of schools 
with an EAP had it “visible everywhere.”14
This study found that having an AT available at the high 
school was associated with EAP implementation. However, 
nearly half of the schools with an AT had not implemented 
venue-specific EAPs. It is possible that ADs were unaware of 
existing EAPs, though awareness is arguably a major part of 
implementation, and AD and administration review (along with 
distribution and practice) of EAPs is clearly delineated in the 
recommendations.1,3 Regardless of explanation, EAP 
implementation should be emphasized for all high schools.
AED Availability
Life-saving equipment must be readily available if it is to be 
beneficial. Only 56% of schools in this study met the 
recommendation for having an AED available for early 
defibrillation, which is nearly identical to results of a previous 
study.14 Timely AED availability was associated with AT school 
presence, with all of the schools with an AT having at least 1 AED 
on campus. These results suggest ATs may have a role in both the 
presence and timely availability of AEDs on high school campuses.
Of note, early defibrillation was defined in this study as <4 
minutes. This time frame is longer,3 within,4,7 or less than others.8 
Ideally, an AED would be immediately available at all venues; 
however, this goal is unlikely to be met at this time given the 
myriad of constraints, such as cost and lack of trained personnel.
Availability of Trained Personnel
Multiple organizations recommend that ATs be available for 
emergency situations.3-5,16 Despite this, only 50% of responding 
Oregon high schools had an AT available, nearly identical to a 
recent estimate.18 Many schools either have no AT or do not 
have ATs at all venues; thus, initial emergency response will 
likely fall on coaches. Regardless of AT presence, coaches in 
85% of schools provided care, similar to previous reports.6,9 
This is despite previous reports indicating that coaches lack 
the knowledge deemed necessary to provide adequate 
care.2,11,20,22
Because sudden cardiac arrest is the leading nontraumatic 
cause of death in young athletes, CPR and AED training are 
vital.13 However, only 31% of the schools reported requiring 
coach certification in CPR and AED use, nearly identical to a 
previous study.9 While some coaches may have completed 
training voluntarily, school policy is more likely than 
individual choice to achieve universal coach CPR and AED 
training.
Coach CPR and AED training was not associated with AT 
presence. One potential explanation is that this 
recommendation requires at least a school-wide mandate, which 
ATs do not have the authority to institute.
This study is not without limitations. The survey has not been 
validated; therefore, it is unknown whether what the ADs 
reported is what is actually occurring in schools. Hence, it may 
be beneficial to survey ATs as well as ADs. Nonetheless, an AD’s 
lack of knowledge would still not be considered best practice 
and indicates the need for improvements in emergency 
preparedness. Additionally, future studies should examine 
whether schools in other states are similar in their sports-related 
emergency preparedness.
conclusion
Much work remains to prepare schools and their personnel for 
sports-related medical emergencies. While most schools have an 
AED on campus, other areas related to emergency preparedness 
lag. To maximize effectiveness, all facets of the emergency 
response must be in place: a plan, trained personnel, and 
equipment available immediately.
The likelihood of inadequate emergency planning is greater in 
the absence of an AT. ATs are ideally suited to guide the 
development and implementation of emergency policies and 
procedures; schools should use the AT as a resource, and ATs 
must in turn promote the use of best practices. In schools 
without an AT, other approaches will be required to improve 
best practice implementation. Policy changes at multiple levels 
may be needed to effectively implement change.
