Abstract Disuse-induced loss of muscle power can be detrimental in older individuals, seriously
impairing functional capacity. In this study, we examined the changes in maximal explosive
power (MEP) of lower limbs induced by a 14-day disuse (bed-rest, BR) and a subsequent 14-day
retraining, to assess whether the impact of disuse was greater in older than in young men, and
to analyse the causes of such adaptations. Sixteen older adults (Old: 55–65 years) and seven
Young (18–30 years) individuals participated in this study. In a subgroup of eight Old subjects,
countermeasures based on cognitive training and protein supplementation were applied. MEP
was measured with an explosive ergometer, muscle mass was determined by magnetic resonance,

not in Young. Retraining tended to increase MEP; however, this intervention was not sufficient to
restore pre-BR values in Old. Ankle co-contraction increased after BR in Old only, and remained
elevated after retraining (+30%). Significant atrophy occurred in slow fibres in Old, and in fast
fibres in Young. After retraining, the recovery of muscle fibre thickness was partial. The proposed
countermeasures were not sufficient to affect muscle mass and power. The greater impact of disuse
and smaller retraining-induced recovery observed in Old highlight the importance of designing
suitable rehabilitation protocols for older individuals.

Introduction
People above the age of 60 years represent the fastest
growing
segment
of
the
population
in
developed
countries, and their quality of life can be dramatically
compromised by reduced mobility (McPhee et al. 2013).
Epidemiological research has associated reduced mobility
with loss of muscle mass and muscular weakness (Janssen,
2006; Hairi et al. 2010). In particular, sarcopenia is a
condition that can result from different factors, and
can lead to outcomes characterized by progressive and
generalized loss of skeletal muscle mass and function
(strength and physical performance) (see Cruz-Jentoft
et al. 2010). The loss of muscle mass leads to a decrease in
muscle strength; additionally, older people also experience
a loss of strength per unit of muscle mass (Rutherford &
Jones, 1992; Goodpaster et al. 2006), which may explain
why muscle weakness in the elderly is a better predictor of
mortality than muscle mass alone (Newman et al. 2006).
Interestingly, skeletal muscle power has been proposed as
a more critical determinant of physical functioning in the
elderly population than muscle strength (Reid & Fielding,
2012) or size (Runge et al. 2004). Muscle power exerted
by knee and lower limb extensors has been shown to
decline earlier and more rapidly than muscle strength with
advancing age (Aagaard et al. 2010), and it is considered a
better performance predictor of various motor tasks (i.e.
rising from a chair, climbing stairs) as compared to muscle
strength in mobility-limited elderly people (Bassey et al.
1992; Foldvari et al. 2000; Reid & Fielding, 2012).
Besides ageing, disuse is an important cause of
muscle deterioration. Periods of skeletal muscle disuse or
unloading can occur in healthy people as a consequence
of injury or illness. The physiological effects of disuse
and unloading have been widely studied by bed rest
(BR), which is a recognized experimental model to
induce substantial muscle dysfunction within a few weeks,
remarkably compromising the generation of muscle
power. Young healthy males decrease their ability to
generate maximal muscular power of the lower limbs by
about 24–30% after 35–90 days of BR without counter-
measures (Ferretti, 1997; Rittweger et al. 2007; Rejc
et al. 2015). The loss of muscle power after disuse is
closely correlated to muscle atrophy. BR studies on young
healthy males showed that disuse-induced muscle atrophy
is unevenly distributed, being larger in postural than
non-postural muscles, larger in the extensors than in the
other thigh muscle groups, and greater in the calf muscles
than in the other leg muscle groups (Ferretti et al. 2001;
Alkner & Tesch, 2004; de Boer et al. 2008; Belavy et al.
2009). Atrophic response to BR can be rapid; for example,
7 days of BR induced a 3% decrease of thigh muscle
mass (Ferrando et al. 1995). Longer BR induced greater
atrophic effects, with a 12% and 8% decrement in gastro-
cnemius medialis and vastus lateralis muscle thickness
after a 35-day BR, respectively (de Boer et al. 2008), and a
reduction of quadriceps and calf muscle mass by about
30% after 90–120 days of BR (Alkner & Tesch, 2004;
Shackelford et al. 2004). Other important components
of the loss of muscle power in relation to disuse are the
decreased ability in motor unit recruitment (Lambertz
et al. 2001; Clark et al. 2006) and the reduction of muscle
intrinsic force (force/cross sectional area) (Pavy-Le Traon
et al. 2007; Narici & de Boer, 2011).

Disuse and retraining effects on muscle power in older adults
649
In spite of the vast amount of literature focused on the
separate effects of either ageing or disuse, there are rather
few studies that have investigated the combined effects of
these two factors (ageing and disuse) on neuromuscular
function. However, the occurrence of disuse periods in the
elderly population is frequent (Suetta et al. 2007) and can
lead to serious consequences such as further reduction of
daily physical activity (Kortebein et al. 2008), functional
decline (Hoenig & Rubenstein, 1991; Creditor, 1993),
greater risks for falls and consequent hip fractures, which
have long-lasting negative effects on quality of life and
a strong association with mortality (Wall et al. 2013). In
healthyelderlyindividuals,neuromuscularfunctionseems
differently affected by short-term disuse than in the young
population. In particular, 2 weeks of immobilization by
unilateral, whole leg casting reduced quadriceps femoris
activation in old but not young men, while the decline in
quadriceps volume was smaller in old compared to young
(Suetta et al. 2009). Under the same experimental design,
elderly individuals also showed a greater decrease in rapid
force capacity (Hvid et al. 2010). Similarly, Deschenes et al.
(2008) observed that muscle performance during faster
contractions of the quadriceps femoris was more impaired
in elderly than young individuals after 1 week of lower
limb suspension. Shorter periods of disuse (i.e. 4 days of
one-leg immobilization) also have a greater impact on the
neuromuscular system in old than in young subjects (Hvid
et al. 2013, 2014). Interestingly, elderly individuals also
showed reduced recovery of neuromuscular function as
compared to young subjects when physical retraining was
proposed after immobilization. For example, 4 weeks of
physical training subsequent to 2 weeks of immobilization
induced increments in quadriceps femoris volume that
were smaller in elderly than in young males (Suetta et al.
2009), and promoted full recovery of muscle fibre area
and rapid force capacity in young but not in elderly sub-
jects (Hvid et al. 2010). Age-related differences in the
recovery of neuromuscular function seem to increase with
shorter immobilization and retraining periods, as 7 days
of recovery subsequent to 4 days of immobilization were
not sufficient to restore isometric and dynamic muscle
strength as well as rapid muscle force capacity in elderly,
while these parameters were fully recovered in young sub-
jects (Hvid et al. 2013, 2014).
The differential impact of a period of disuse on bone
metabolism (Buehlmeier et al. 2017), protein synthesis
(Biolo et al. 2017), plasma brain-derived neurotrophic
factor (BDNF) levels (Soavi et al. 2016) and adipokine
values (Jurdana et al. 2015) in older adults compared
to young people has been investigated by our group
in a recent BR study. Also, we have examined the
combined effects of ageing and disuse, followed by
physical retraining, on muscle mass and performance
(Pisot et al. 2016). Because ageing can exacerbate the
negative effects of disuse on different systems, specific
countermeasures (cognitive training during BR and
protein supplementation during physical retraining) were
proposed to an experimental subgroup of older adult
individuals. Computerized cognitive training during BR
improved executive/attention ability as well as processing
speed (Marusic et al. 2018), and significantly modulated
plasma BDNF levels (Passaro et al. 2017). On the other
hand, Pisot et al. (2016) noted that these two counter-
measures did not promote significant effects on muscle
mass and performance in the experimental subgroup of
older adults as compared to control older adults who did
not receive any countermeasure. Among the combined
effects of age and disuse, the loss of lower limb extensors
power has particular relevance with regard to everyday
life movements such as rising from a chair or climbing
stairs (Bassey et al. 1992). Importantly, Pisot et al. (2016)
observed that in older adults, the reduction of maximal
explosive power (MEP) of lower limb extensors induced
bythe14-dayBRwashigher(−15.2%)thanexpectedfrom
the reduction of muscle mass (−8.3%). This prompted us
to further examine different factors that may contribute
to such MEP decrease. In this study, we re-examined the
issue by investigating how BR affected muscle mass, single
muscle fibre properties and motor control, and whether
these factors played a similar role on the BR-induced loss
of MEP in young and older subjects. In addition, these
parameters were also analysed in both young and older
individuals after a period of physical retraining to gain
insight into how ageing affects muscle function recovery.
Finally, the results were also analysed separately for the
two subgroups of older adults (with and without counter-
measures) to corroborate the previous statements related
to the lack of positive effects of cognitive training and
protein supplementation on these parameters.
Methods
Ethical approval
The present study was conducted according to the
standards set by the latest revision of the Declaration
of Helsinki except for registration in a database, and
was approved by the National Ethical Committee of the
Slovenian Ministry of Health on 17 April 2012, under the
acronym IR-aging 1200. The purposes and objectives of
this study were carefully explained to the subjects and
written informed consent was obtained from all of them.
Subjects
Sixteen healthy older adult males (Old; age: 59.6 ±
3.4 years) and seven healthy young males (Young; age:
23.1 ± 2.9 years) participated in this study. Before
the start of the study, all subjects filled out a physical
activity-related questionnaire (Craig et al. 2003), had

a full medical history and physical examination that
also included routine haematology and biochemistry
screens, and underwent a fitness battery test. Exclusion
criteria were: smoking; regular alcohol consumption;
ferromagnetic implants; history of deep vein thrombosis
with D-dimer > 500 μg L−1; acute or chronic skeletal,
neuromuscular, metabolic and cardiovascular disease
conditions; pulmonary embolism; or a short physical
performance battery score <9 (Guralnik et al. 1994).
None of the subjects experienced any significant disease
and none was taking medications regularly or made
use of any medication known to influence physical
performance.
Study protocol
The subjects spent 19 consecutive days at the Orthopedic
Hospital of Valdoltra (Ankaran, Slovenia), including
3 days of familiarization to study environment and diet,
baseline data collection, and 14 days of BR. Immediately
after BR, subjects underwent supervised physical training,
which was conducted at the same facility and at a
nearby gym. To explore possible interventions aimed at
mitigating the negative disuse-induced adaptations and
enhancing physical retraining effects, a subgroup of eight
randomly selected older adults (Old Int) underwent daily
45 min of computerized cognitive training by navigating
through virtual mazes with the use of a joystick and
computer during the 14-day BR. The same eight subjects
also received a nutritional support based on 0.4 g whey
protein kg body weight−1 day−1 at breakfast during
the initial 14 days of physical training. By contrast, the
eight older adults included in the control subgroup
(Old Ctrl) did not receive any additional countermeasure
throughout the study.
Anthropometric characteristics, body composition and
MEP of the lower limbs were measured 1 day before the
BR (Pre-BR), the day after the 14-day BR (Post-BR) and
after 2 weeks of physical training (R + 14). Quadriceps
muscle volume was assessed after 12 h of BR initiation
(Pre-BR), on the evening of the last day of BR (Post-BR)
and following 12 h of horizontal position after 2 weeks of
physical training (R + 14).
Bed rest
The participants were housed in standard air-conditioned
hospital
rooms
and
were
under
constant
visual
surveillance with 24-h medical care. During BR, the
subjects performed all daily activities in bed with no
deviations from the lying position permitted, and both
exercise and muscle contraction tests were not allowed. All
participants received hospital meals three times a day and
followed an individually controlled eucaloric diet during
the BR period. Dietary energy requirements were designed
for each subject multiplying resting energy expenditure by
factors 1.2 and 1.4 in the bed rest and ambulatory periods,
respectively (Biolo et al. 2008). The macronutrient food
content was set at 60% carbohydrates, 25% fat and 15%
proteins. Energy balance was checked weekly by fat mass
assessment.
During BR, all subjects received passive physiotherapy
treatments (i.e. joint mobility and stretching, relief
massage in the presence of acute back pain) three times per
week. To prevent thrombosis, a D-dimer test was repeated
on Day 7 of bed rest where participants reached elevated
values but scored <500 μg L−1; however, additional
Dopplerultrasoundcheck-upwasconductedinallofthem
and all wore compression socks.
Physical training programme
Subjects began a 28-day physical training programme on
the second day after the end of BR; however, only the
initial 14 days of physical training were considered in this
study, i.e. the same duration of the disuse period. Physical
training consisted of six sessions in total (three per week);
each session, which lasted about 65 min, was followed
by 1 or 2 days of routine daily activity. Physical training
was aimed at reconditioning both the neuromuscular
and the aerobic systems, proposing a series of exercises
that did not require specific training equipment so that
they could be translated to any home and community
environment. The first 12 min of each training session
was devoted to warm-up; subjects performed 6 min of
Nordic walking, its speed being determined from a 2-km
walking test performed before BR, and 6 min of active
stretching (10 exercises). Subjects then performed 20 min
of strength and balance exercises. This section started with
half squat (one set; 10 repetitions; overload: from no over-
load to a 6 kg ball held with both hands), and continued
with a circuit training (30 s of exercise followed by 30 s
of rest) consisting of eight motor tasks. In particular, the
following strength exercises focused on lower limbs were
proposed: frontal and sagittal plane lunge, double leg heel
raise with elastic resistance; hip extension with elastic
resistance. Also, balance exercises mainly consisted of
dynamic standing balance activities (i.e. standing on toes;
standing on balance foams) and functional movements
that involved reaching and passing objects. Strength and
balance exercises were followed by 30 min of aerobic
exercise (e.g. Nordic walking, brisk walking, running).
The last 3 min were devoted to cool down (relaxation
and breathing exercises). Subjects’ heart rate was pre-
ventivelymonitoredduringeachtrainingsession.Training
was conducted at the hospital and in the gym near
the hospital and supervised by six physical trainers who
instructed the subjects to properly perform the different
exercises. All subjects performed all planned training
sessions.

Disuse and retraining effects on muscle power in older adults

Measurements
Anthropometric characteristics and body composition.
Body mass (BM) was measured to the nearest 0.1 kg with
a manual weighing scale (Seca 709, Hamburg, Germany)
with the subject dressed only in light underwear and no
shoes. Stature was measured to the nearest 0.5 cm on a
standardized wall-mounted height board.
Body composition was measured by using bioelectrical
impedance analysis with a tetra-polar impedance-meter
(BIA101, Akern, Florence, Italy), according to an accepted
method (Lukaski et al. 1986). Body composition [fat-free
mass (FFM) and fat mass (FM)] was obtained from the
software provided by the manufacturer. This method has
already been utilized and validated to investigate changes
in body composition during BR and in clinical settings
(Birch & Fisher, 1998; Kyle et al. 2004).
Magnetic
resonance
imaging. Quadriceps
femoris
muscle volume of the right leg was measured from
turbo
spin-echo,
T1-weighted,
magnetic
resonance
images (MRI) obtained with a 1.5 T Magnetom Avanto
device (Siemens Medical Solution, Erlangen, Germany).
On each MRI slice, contours corresponding to the
quadriceps muscles were delineated by an MRI expert,
using the image processing tools OsiriX (Pixmeo Sarl,
v.4.1.2). Quadriceps muscle volume was then derived by
summation of a series of evenly spaced truncated cones
between each of two axial images, a process that included
an average of 25 images (range 23–28) and covered the
entire length of the quadriceps.
Maximal explosive power of the lower limbs. The
biomechanical parameters of the explosive efforts were
studied by means of an Explosive Ergometer (EXER),
described previously in detail (Lazzer et al. 2009). Briefly,
the EXER consists of a metal frame supporting one
rail, which was inclined by 20 deg. A seat, fixed on a
carriage, was free to move on the rail, its velocity along
the direction of motion being continuously recorded by a
wire tachometer (LIKA SGI, Vicenza, Italy). The subject
was able to accelerate him/herself and the carriage seat
backward by pushing on two force platforms (LAUMAS
PA 300, Parma, Italy) positioned perpendicular to the rail.
The total moving mass of the EXER (seat and carriage
together) was equal to 31.6 kg. Force and velocity analog
outputs were sampled at 2000 Hz using a data acquisition
system (MP100; BIOPAC Systems, Inc., Goleta, CA, USA).
The instantaneous power was calculated from the product
of instantaneous force and velocity values.
The subject was seated on the carriage seat, secured
by a safety harness tightened around the shoulders
and abdomen, with their arms on the handlebars. Two
mechanical blocks were used to set the distance between
the seat and the force platforms, so that the knee angle
at rest was 110 deg. The blocks also prevented any
countermovement and, consequently, any recovery of
elastic energy during the pushing phase. After a brief
familiarization session with the laboratory equipment,
the subjects performed four maximal explosive efforts, the
duration of which was about 400 ms. After each push, sub-
jects rested for 2 min with their feet placed on a support.

Surface electromyography recordings. Surface electro-
myography (EMG) data were collected from four muscles
oftherightlowerlimb:vastuslateralis(VL),bicepsfemoris
(BF), gastrocnemius medialis (GM) and tibialis anterior
(TA). Pre-gelled surface EMG electrodes (circular contact
area of 1 cm diameter, BIOPAC Systems) were placed
(inter-electrodedistance20mm)atthefollowinglocations
(Hermens et al. 2000): (a) for VL at two-thirds on the
line from the anterior superior iliac spine to the lateral
side of the patella; (b) for BF midway between the ischial
tuberosity and the lateral epicondyle of the tibia; (c) for
GM on the most prominent bulge of the muscle; (d) for
TA at one-third on the line between the tip of the fibula
and the tip of the medial malleolus. To ensure a good
electrode–skin interface, prior to the application of the
electrodes, the subject’s skin was shaved, rubbed with
an abrasive paste, cleaned with an alcohol solution and
dry-cleaned with gauze.
EMG data were sampled at a frequency of 2 kHz, and
recorded by a four-channel EMG system (EMG100C,
BIOPAC Systems; Band-pass Filter: 10–500 Hz; RMS
noise voltage: 0.2 μV; input impedance: 2 M�; common
mode rejection ratio: 110 dB). To place electrodes in
the same anatomical location during the three different
experimental sessions, the position of electrodes was
marked on acetate paper using moles and small angiomas
(which may be assumed to maintain a fixed position)
as reference points. The EMG electrodes were fixed at
the beginning of each experimental session and were not
removed between explosive efforts and isometric contra-
ctions (see below) of the lower limbs.
Maximal voluntary contractions. To normalize EMG
signal recorded from the four analysed muscles (VL, BF,
GM and TA) during explosive efforts, maximal voluntary
isometric contractions (MVCs) of the right lower limb
were performed either on a special chair (a) or on an
adapted examination bed (b):
a) The subject was seated with his legs hanging vertically
down. A strap, connected in series to a force sensor
(TSD121C, BIOPAC Systems), was tightened around
the subject’s right ankle. The force sensor was fixed
in series to a steel frame. The position of this
frame was set prior the execution of isometric knee

extension and knee flexion to obtain a knee angle of
110 deg.
b) The subject lay prone on an examination bed. His
right foot was tightened around a custom made
attachment connected to an isometric dynamometer.
Theanteriorpartofthefootsolewasplacedagainstthe
attachment in a flat standardized position, to obtain
an ankle angle of 90 deg.
Force and EMG exerted during MVCs were recorded
at a frequency of 2 kHz using a data acquisition system
(MP100, BIOPAC Systems). Subjects were asked to
perform three MVCs of 4–5 s for each isometric effort.
To prevent fatigue, after each contraction subjects rested
for 2 min.
EMG data analysis. TheEMGactivitydefinedina500-ms
window centred on maximal force exerted during MVC
was analysed: EMG raw signal was processed using a 5-ms
running-window root mean square, and its mean value
was considered as 100% MVC.
EMG raw signal recorded during the push (i.e.
throughout the period of force development) of the
explosive efforts was processed using a 5-ms running-
window root mean square to obtain its mean value
throughout each push. This was then expressed as
percentage of the value obtained during MVC. To
investigate a co-contraction feature during the push phase
of the explosive efforts at the knee and ankle joints, the
ratio between EMG amplitude of BF (%MVC) and VL
(%MVC) (knee co-contraction) and the ratio between
EMG amplitude of TA (%MVC) and GM (%MVC) (ankle
co-contraction) were calculated. The greater the value of
these indexes the greater the level of co-contraction.
Single muscle fibre experiments. Single muscle fibre
analysis was performed on samples obtained from the
mid-region of the left vastus lateralis muscle. Biopsy
was done after anaesthesia of the skin, subcutaneous
fat tissue, and muscle fascia with 2 mL of lidocaine
(2%). A small incision was then made to penetrate skin
and fascia, and the tissue sample was harvested with
a purpose-built rongeur (Zepf Instruments, Tuttlingen,
Germany). A fragment of the sample, used for single
fibre analysis, was quickly stored in skinning solution
with 50% glycerol at −20°C, while another fragment
was frozen in isopentane cooled with liquid nitrogen.
The solutions used had the following composition (mM):
skinning solution: potassium propionate 150, magnesium
acetate 5, Na-ATP 5, EGTA 5 and KH2PO4 5; relaxing
solution: KCl 100, imidazole 20, MgCl2 5, Na-ATP 5 and
EGTA 5; preactivating solution had a similar composition
except that EGTA concentration was reduced to 0.5 mM,
and 25 mM creatine phosphate and 300 U mL−1 creatine
phosphokinase were added; activating solution (pCa 4.6)
was also similar to relaxing solution with the addition of
5 mM CaCl2, 25 mM creatine phosphate and 300 U mL−1
creatine phosphokinase. The pH of all solutions was
adjusted to 7.0 at the temperature at which solutions
were used (12°C). Protease inhibitors (E64 10 μM and
leupeptine 40 μM) were present in all solutions.
On the day of the experiment, single muscle fibre
segments were dissected from the samples stored and
mounted in a drop of relaxing solution between the force
transducer (AME-801 SensorOne, Sausalito, CA, USA)
and the electromagnetic puller (Scientific Instruments,
Heidelberg, Germany) equipped with a displacement
transducer. The signals from the force and displacement
transducers were fed and stored in a computer after A/D
conversion (interface CED 1401 plus, CED, Cambridge,
UK). For data storage, recall and analysis the software
Spike 2 (CED) was used. The experimental setup
consisted of an inverted microscope (Axiovert 25, Zeiss,
Oberkochen, Germany) with a movable and thermo-
regulated
aluminium
plate
on
the
stage.
On
the
aluminium plate, three drops (70 μl volume) of relaxing,
pre-activating and activating solution, respectively, were
kept under a coverslip connected with a movable
arm. Under each solution drop, an opening through
the aluminium plate made the fibre segment visible
via the objective piece of the inverted microscope. A
stereomicroscope (Konus Diamond, Konus, Italy) placed
above the inverted microscope was used for manipulation
of the fibre segment. A digital camera (Optikam
B5, Optika, Bergamo, Italy) allowed measurements of
sarcomere length with a custom-designed software in
at least two regions of interest covering approximately
20 sarcomeres each with resolution of 19.5 pixels μm–1.
Further details of the setup are reported elsewhere (Doria
et al. 2011). Once mounted in the setup, fibre segments
were gently elongated in the relaxing solution to 120%
of the slack length, which corresponded to a sarcomere
length of 2.685 ± 0.011 μm (mean ± SE, n = 710). The
segments then transferred to the pre-activating solution
for at least 1 min and finally maximally activated by
immersion in the activating solution. During maximal
activation,
isometric
force
(Fo)
was
measured
in
several consecutive contractions and unloaded shortening
velocity (Vo) was determined according to the slack test
procedure. To this end, five instantaneous length changes
(<1 ms) were imposed with amplitudes ranging from 5 to
15% of the resting length. Unloaded shortening velocity
was obtained from the slope of the linear regression
between the time required to take up the slack and the
amount of shortening imposed and was expressed in
fibre length per second. Cross-sectional area (CSA) was
calculatedfromthemeasurementsofthreefibrediameters,
assuming a circular shape of the fibre section, while the
fibre was immersed in relaxing solution. Furthermore,
specific force Po = Fo/CSA was also calculated.

The composition in Myosin Heavy Chains (MyHC)
isoforms of each fibre segment was determined on
8% polyacrylamide slab gels after denaturation in SDS
(SDS-PAGE) as described by Doria et al. (2011). Gels were
silver stained and three bands were separated in the region
of 200 kDa, corresponding (in order of migration from
the fastest to the slowest) to MyHC-1, MyHC-2A and
MyHC-2X. The same protocol was followed to separate
MyHC isoforms in the frozen fragment of the biopsy,
with Coomassie Blue staining of the gels. The relative
proportions of MyHC isoforms were obtained from the
measurements of the brightness area product (BAP, i.e. the
product of the area of the band by the average brightness
subtracted local background after black–white inversion)
after scanning the gels to an accuracy of 600 d.p.i.
For each sample the electrophoretic separation and the
densitometry measurements were repeated three times.
Statistical analyses. Statistical analyses were performed
using SPSS 19.0 software (IBM, Chicago, MI, USA), with
significance set at P < 0.05. Normal distribution of the
data was tested using the Shapiro–Wilk test. Sphericity
was verified by Mauchly’s test. When the assumption of
sphericity was not met, the significance of the F-ratios was
adjusted according to the Greenhouse–Geisser procedure.
Differences in baseline data of body mass, stature and body
massindexamonggroupswereanalysedbyagenerallinear
model of the main effect of group (Old Int vs. Old Ctrl
vs. Young). Changes of anthropometric characteristics,
bodycomposition,quadricepsfemorisvolume(QF),MEP,
MVC, EMG data and per cent distribution of MyHC iso-
forms were analysed with general linear model repeated
measures with two factors considering three groups
(Old Int vs. Old Ctrl vs. Young) and time (Pre-BR vs.
Post-BR vs. R + 14). When significant differences were
found, a Bonferroni post hoc test was used to determine
the exact location of the difference. Changes of muscle
fibres characteristics (CSA, Fo, Po and Vo) were analysed
with a generalized linear mixed model, which accounts
for fixed effects due to group (Old Int vs. Old Ctrl vs.
Young) and time (Pre-BR vs. Post-BR vs. R + 14) taking
into account the correlation of the data. The same analyses
were also performed pooling together the two subgroups
of older adults (Old group) to strengthen the focus of the
present study on ageing, disuse and physical training.
Results
Physical characteristics of subjects
All participants were able to comply with the study
protocol. There was no dropout, and no medical
complications occurred beside transient hypotension
during the 10 min orthostatic tolerance testing at the end
of BR in seven participants (three in Old and four in
Young). Baseline values of body mass, stature, body mass
index, body composition and lifestyle were not different
among the two groups of older adults and the Young
group (Table 1). However, quadriceps femoris muscle
volume was significantly greater in Young compared to
Old (+15.3%, P = 0.038, Table 2), while it was similar
between Old Int and Old Ctrl (P = 0.757).
Body mass, total body fat-free mass and quadriceps
femoris muscle volume were similar between Old Ctrl and
Old Int both after BR and after physical training (P values
ranging from 0.394 to 0.971; Table 2).
BR induced significant decreases in body mass (−3.1
and−4.4%,P<0.001,inOldandYoung,respectively)and
in total body fat-free mass (−6.2 and −7.6%, P < 0.005,
in Old and Young, respectively) in both Old and Young
(Table 2). Similarly, a significant decrease in muscle
volume of quadriceps femoris occurred in Old (−8.3%,
P < 0.001), and the same trend was observed in Young
(−6.1%, P = 0.052). Physical training performed after
BR increased body mass in both groups (+2.4 and
+3.9%, P < 0.001, in Old and Young, respectively);

however, the increment in total body fat-free mass and
quadriceps femoris muscle volume was significant in
Old only (+4.4%, P < 0.006, and +5.7%, P < 0.001,
respectively). It is important to note that physical training
tended to restore quadriceps femoris muscle volume to
Pre-BR values in Old (−3.1%, P = 0.048), and to fully
restore it in Young (−1.7%, P = 0.428) (Table 2).
MEP and MVCs of the lower limbs
MEP, peak force, peak velocity and specific MEP values
were similar between the two groups of older adults
(Old Ctrl and Old Int) at all three investigated time points
(P values ranging from 0.561 to 0.982; Fig. 1 and Table 3).
Young subjects consistently exerted higher MEP than
Old (� +33%, P < 0.001) across the three investigated
time points (Fig. 1A). Accordingly, greater peak force and
velocity(�+16%forbothmeasurements,P<0.005)were
found in Young compared to Old (Table 3). Importantly,
MEP normalized to quadriceps femoris muscle volume
(specific MEP) was also consistently higher in Young than
in Old (� +19%, P < 0.005) at Pre-BR, Post-BR and R +
14 (Fig. 1B).
BR caused a decrease in MEP (−15.2%, P < 0.001,
Fig. 1A) as well as peak force and velocity (Table 3) in
Old; a similar trend was observed in Young, as MEP
decreased by 10.4% (P = 0.067) after BR. The subsequent
physicalretrainingsignificantlyincreasedMEPonlyinOld
(+8.1%, P = 0.018; Fig. 1A). However, MEP developed
at R + 14 was still significantly lower than before BR
for Old (−8.3%, P = 0.011) but not for Young (−5.7%,
P = 0.370). In Old, this lack of complete MEP recovery
at R + 14 was accompanied by a significantly lower peak
force (−8.1%, P < 0.001) compared to Pre-BR (Table 3).
Specific MEP did not change significantly across the three
experimental time points in both Old and Young groups
(Fig. 1B). However, it might be of note that in Old specific
MEP tended to decrease after BR (−7.7%, P = 0.133) and
to remain lower than at Pre-BR (−7.0%, P = 0.148) also
after the completion of physical training.
To examine the changes in contractile force related to
disuse and retraining, the force developed during MVCs
of quadriceps femoris muscle was analysed. As seen in
Fig. 2A, MVC values were lower in Old compared to
Young (by approximately −20%) at any time point, and
showed a significant decrease at the end of BR only in older
adults(Old:−13%,P<0.001;Old Ctrl:−15%,P=0.012;
Old Int: −11%, P = 0.006). MVC values recorded at R +
14 were comparable to those collected before BR for both
Old and Young. No significant differences were observed
between MVC values exerted by Old Ctrl and Old Int
at any time point (difference ranging from 6 to 11%;
Pvalues rangingfrom0.204to0.521).MVCnormalizedby

Single muscle fibre variations with age and bed rest
To
assess
whether
the
structural
and
functional
characteristics of single muscle fibres could contribute to
the difference between older adults and young individuals
and to the changes of lower limb muscle force and power
following BR and physical retraining, large populations
of fibres were dissected from biopsy samples taken from
vastus lateralis and analysed as described in the Methods.
The total populations analysed with single fibre
experiments comprised 233 fibres (84 in Old Ctrl; 77 in
Old Int; 72 in Young) in Pre-BR biopsy sampling, 243
fibres (84 in Old Ctrl; 86 in Old Int; 73 in Young) in
Post-BR and 241 fibres (84 in Old Ctrl; 87 in Old Int;
70 in Young) in post physical retraining sampling. When
grouped according to their myosin isoform composition,
which was adopted as a molecular marker of fibre type,
slow fibres represented 27–28% in the biopsies of Young
subjects and 33–39% in the biopsies of Old, suggesting an
age-related fibre type transition. Fast 2A fibres represented
35–44% in the biopsy samples of Young and 24–31% in the
biopsy samples of Old. The remaining fraction comprised

hybrid fibres (slow-fast 2A and fast 2A-2X) and in Young
subjects a minor group of pure 2X fibres (see also Table 4).
No difference was detectable in electrophoretic separation
of MyHC isoforms on muscle homogenates (Table 5).
The variations of CSA and of isometric force developed
during maximal activation (Fo) are reported in Fig. 3
together with their ratio, Po = Fo/CSA, and the value
of unloaded shortening velocity (Vo). Only the most
abundant fibre types, slow, fast 2A and fast 2A-2X, are
considered, because for the other types (hybrid slow-fast
2A and pure 2X) there were too few fibres to produce
reliable measurements and statistical comparisons. Inter-
estingly, the response to disuse was different in slow and
fast2AbetweenYoungandOldsubjects,whilethetwosub-
groups of older adults (Old Ctrl and Old Int) showed very
similar results. In baseline sampling, slow fibres showed
similar CSA in Young and Old, while fast 2A fibres showed
significantly lower CSA values in Old (−27%, P < 0.05)
compared to Young subjects (Table 4 and Fig. 3A and E).
BR caused a significant reduction of CSA, i.e. atrophy at
the single fibre level, in fast 2A fibres of Young subjects
(−28%, Fig. 3E) and in slow fibres of Old subjects (−19%,
Fig. 3A), clearly pointing to a differential sensitivity to
disuse. By contrast, CSA values after BR were similar
between Old Ctrl and Old Int both in slow, in fast 2A and
in fast 2A2X fibres (P values ranging from 0.512 to 0.881,
Fig. 3A, E and I). The determination of isometric force (Fo,
see Fig. 3B) revealed a significant decrease in slow fibres of
both Young (−42%) and older adults (−22% in Old Ctrl;
−29% in Old Int) at the end of BR and this resulted in
a reduction in specific force (Po) in the slow fibres of the
Young (−44%, Fig. 3C) subjects. No significant difference
was observed in unloaded shortening velocity comparing
Pre-BR, Post-BR and R + 14 (Fig. 3D, H and N). In both
Young and Old, fast 2A-2X fibres showed a trend to a
decrease in Fo and Po after BR, which remained below
statistical significance. Importantly, at R + 14 CSA values
of slow and fast 2A fibres and Fo values of slow fibres were
lower than before BR in the older adult subjects, indicating
an incomplete structural and functional recovery (Fig. 3A,
B and E). Moreover, fast 2A-2X fibres of Young showed
lower values of Fo and Po at R + 14 than before BR (Fig. 3L
and M).
Knee and ankle co-contraction
Finally, to gain insight into the contribution of motor
control to the variations in MEP, we recorded the
EMG activity of knee and ankle flexor and extensor
muscles to calculate an index of co-contraction between
antagonist muscles (see Methods). As shown in Fig. 4, the

all three groups. In Young, ankle co-contraction was also
not affected by BR and physical retraining. Conversely, in
both older adult groups, ankle co-contraction showed an
increase after BR (Old: +27.6%, P = 0.035), and remained
greater than at Pre-BR also at R + 14 (Old: +30.4%,
P = 0.017) (Fig. 4).
Discussion
In this study, we showed that the MEP of lower limbs in
healthy older adult males (mean age: 60 years) was about
30% lower than in young males (mean age: 23 years). MEP
normalized by quadriceps femoris muscle volume was also
substantially lower (−19%) in older adults. Fourteen days
of BR induced a significant decrement of MEP in Old,
and a similar trend was observed in Young. A period
of physical retraining that had the same duration of BR
(2weeks)tendedtoincreaseMEPinbothgroups;however,
this intervention was not sufficient to restore muscle
power to Pre-BR values in older adults. Additional inter-
ventions(cognitivetrainingandproteinsupplementation)
tested on one subgroup of older adults (Old Int) did
not mitigate BR-induced muscle atrophy and MEP
decrement and did not enhance physical training-induced
adaptations.
Lower limb muscle function was affected by age
Before any intervention, MEP developed by a group
of older adult men was about 30% lower than that
exerted by a group of young subjects with similar life
style, body weight and stature (Fig. 1A). Note that the
difference in MEP as well as in other parameters was
clearly detectable even if the age of the older group was
not very advanced (approximately 60 years). The rate
of decline of muscle function is relatively slow from 20
to 50 years of age, and becomes marked after 50 years
of age (Wilmore, 1991). Previous studies found that
muscle power decreases over the age range 65–89 years
by about 3.5% every year (Skelton et al. 1994), with
longitudinal observations indicating a 6% annual loss of
muscle power over 3 years among adults aged 70–85 years
(Clark et al. 2013). Muscle mass of the lower limbs, and
in particular of the knee extensors (quadriceps femoris),
directly affects the level of muscle power that can be
exerted by lower limbs (Ferretti et al. 2001). As expected,
our results indicated that quadriceps muscle volume was
lower (−15.3%; Table 2) in older adults (Rosenberg, 1997;
McPhee et al. 2013), contributing to explain their lower
MEP. However, when MEP was normalized per unit of
quadriceps muscle volume (specific MEP), it was still sub-
stantially lower (�−19%) in Old than in Young (Fig. 1B).
This difference in specific MEP generated during a fast

(�400 ms) and relatively complex movement that involves
threejointsandtheinteractionofuni-andmulti-articulate
muscle–tendon units was conceivably due to different
components. One of them can be related to different
single muscle fibre characteristics between Young and Old.
Single muscle fibre analysis showed a greater abundance of
slow fibres in Old (� 40%) compared to Young (� 28%)
(Table 4). These data are in agreement with previous
observations (Lexell et al. 1988; Klitgaard et al. 1990b),
butarenotsupportedbyelectrophoresisanddensitometry
of MyHC, which accounts not only for fibre abundance
but also for fibre size. Slow fibres develop less force and
shorten at lower speed (see Table 4) and this implies a
lower peak power output. In addition, fast 2A fibres were
not only less abundant but also thinner (see Table 4) in
Old compared to Young. An age-related selective atrophy
of fast fibres in knee extensor muscles was observed for
the first time by Klitgaard et al. (1990a) and confirmed
by more recent studies (e.g. Brunner et al. 2007; Murgia
et al. 2017). Thus, quantitative variations in muscle fibre
type distribution and size, together with different levels of
intramuscular fat and fibrosis, would be expected to play
a role in age-related loss of specific power (Marcus et al.
2012; McGregor et al. 2014).
In addition, differences in muscle architecture and
tendon properties between young and older adults have
been previously found, making these factors potential
contributors to the age-related decline in muscle power
and mobility (Stenroth et al. 2015). In particular, muscle
fascicle length affects muscle power production capacity
according to force–length and force–velocity relationships
(Narici & Maganaris, 2007). Also, the lower tendon
stiffness shown by elderly subjects (Stenroth et al.
2012) conceivably impairs the tendon roles of “energy
re-distributor” and “power amplifier” during explosive
movements (Hof et al. 1983; Fukashiro et al. 2006; Cormie
et al. 2011).
Finally, motor control is an important component for
the multi-articular development of muscle power, and its
deterioration has been recently indicated as one of the
relevant mechanisms responsible for age-related loss of
muscle function (Venturelli et al. 2015). In particular,
ageing leads to the loss of spinal motor neurons and
changes in maximal motor neuron firing frequency,
activation capacity, co-contraction of antagonist muscles
and spinal inhibitory circuitry (Klass et al. 2008; Aagaard
et al. 2010). Our results indicated that the level of
co-contraction at the knee and ankle joints was similar
between Old and Young (Fig. 4); hence, it can be assumed
that this neuromuscular feature was not responsible for
the MEP difference between groups. However, activation
capacity was not examined in the present study, and its
age-related decrement (Onambele et al. 2007) could have
playedaroleinthelowerabsoluteandspecificMEPexerted

Disuse and retraining effects on muscle power in older adults

Disuse-induced loss of lower limb muscle power
and volume
Our results showed that 14 days of BR impaired MEP
development in Old (−15.2%), and that the same trend
was observed in Young (−10.4%) (Fig. 1A). This was
accompanied by lower values of peak force and velocity
in Old (Table 3). The amount of MEP lost in the present
study was similar to that observed after a 10-day BR
in healthy elderly individuals (−14%) (Kortebein et al.
2008), and is lower than that observed after longer periods
of disuse without countermeasures in young participants
[about 24–30% after 35–90 days of BR (Ferretti, 1997;
Rittweger et al. 2007; Rejc et al. 2015)]. It is worth
noting that, in the present study, explosive lower limb
extensions were performed under simulated microgravity
(i.e. against an after-load equal to about 48% body
mass), allowing fast lower limb extension movements.
Interestingly, Deschenes et al. (2008) found that, at slower
isokinetic knee extensions, muscle power was similarly

affected in elderly and young individuals (� −11%) after
1 week of unilateral lower limb suspension. However, at
higher contraction speeds, disuse significantly affected
muscle power only in elderly. In addition, other studies
showed that, after a period of short-term immobilization,
rapid muscle force capacity was more affected in elderly
than young men (Hvid et al. 2010, 2014). These findings
might suggest that disuse degrades the functional capacity
of fast-twitch muscle tissue in older adults more than
in young. However, the present study does not support
the hypothesis that BR-induced muscle atrophy targeted
primarily fast fibres in older adults; in fact, atrophy was
more pronounced in slow fibres of Old and in fast 2A
fibres in Young (see below). Hence, it seems plausible
that BR accelerated ageing-related neural impairments
that preferentially affect fast motor neurons (i.e. firing
frequency and activation capacity) (Deschenes et al.
2008; Aagaard et al. 2010), thus inhibiting the capacity of
older adults to activate fast-twitch muscle tissue during
fast muscle contractions. In addition, we found that
co-contraction between representative plantar flexors
and dorsi flexors increased only in older adults after BR.
This can be considered an additional disuse-induced
negative neural adaptation that was amplified by ageing
(Aagaard et al. 2010), as greater levels of co-contraction
generally impair power exertion (Reeves et al. 2006a).
The view that BR may have accelerated ageing-related
neural impairments is also consistent with the fact that
specific MEP tended to be more affected in older adults
(−7.8%) than in young (−4.3%) (Fig. 1B). In fact,
neural adaptations are one of the factors that can affect
muscle-specific power (see discussion above and Narici
& de Boer, 2011). From a functional perspective, the
substantial disuse-induced loss of muscle power in older
adults and elderly individuals can be deleterious, as their
lower limb muscle power is already closer to the critical
threshold required for independent mobility, physical
functioning and lower risk of falling (Reid & Fielding,
2012).
Muscle atrophy is another factor that contributed to the
loss of lower limb muscle power after disuse. BR-induced
muscle atrophy is larger in postural than non-postural
muscles, larger in the extensors than in the other thigh
muscle groups, and larger in the calf muscles than in the
other leg muscle groups (Ferretti et al. 2001; Alkner &
Tesch, 2004; de Boer et al. 2008; Belavy et al. 2009). In
particular, Ferretti et al. (2001) indicated that the loss of
lower limb muscle power after 42 days of BR was primarily
explained by the reduction of quadriceps femoris CSA,
and that other factors such as impaired neural activation
or fibre-specific tension might have accounted for only
5%. In the present study, total-body fat free mass was not
affected by BR in the two groups. Conversely, quadriceps
femorismusclevolumedecreasedbyasimilarextentinOld
(−8.3%) and Young (−6.1%); in both cases, the muscle
volume decrement was smaller than the decrease of MEP
(−15.2% in Old and −10.4% in Young). A comparable
overall amount of muscle atrophy was reported by Suetta
et al. (2009) after 2 weeks of immobilization by unilateral,
whole leg casting; however, these authors reported that
quadriceps muscle volume decreased more in young
(−8.9%) than in elderly males (−5.2%). This last finding
is not in agreement with the similar muscle atrophy
between young and older adults that was found in the
present study. Data on the combined effect of ageing
and disuse on muscle atrophy seem to be not consistent
(Suetta et al. 2009), as also shown by the greater adductor
pollicis muscle atrophy found in elderly compared to
young individuals after 2 weeks of immobilization (Urso
et al. 2006). The differences observed between the pre-
sent study and the two above mentioned studies could be
at least partially explained by the different experimental
conditions (i.e. BR vs. immobilization; larger vs. smaller
muscle group; age: older adults vs. elderly individuals).
It is important to note that, when analysed at single fibre
level, the impact of 2 weeks of disuse is more pronounced
in slow fibres of Old and in fast 2A fibres in Young. Fast
2A-2X fibres are also responsive to BR in Young. This

Disuse and retraining effects on muscle power in older adults

differential response suggests a different functional role
of the two major fibre types in the habitual postural and
locomotor activities which are suppressed during BR. A
greater sensitivity to disuse in fast fibres has been reported
in previous studies (e.g. Hvid et al. 2011). In that study,
however, the decrease in force and specific force was not
different between young and elderly subjects. A possible
explanation can be found in the different protocols, as
Hvid and co-workers induced not only disuse (as in BR),
but also immobilization by applying a cast on the legs.
Six sessions of physical training performed after
disuse were not sufficient to restore lower limb
muscle power in older adults
Inthepresentstudy,aperiodofphysicalretrainingafterBR
of the same duration as the BR promoted incomplete MEP
recovery in older adults, while it restored MEP to pre-BR
values in young individuals (Fig. 1A). Similarly, specific
MEP tended to remain lower than at Pre-BR in older
adults (−6.5%). These findings are in agreement with pre-
vious studies that investigated similar periods of disuse
and retraining, showing incomplete recovery of rapid
force capacity in elderly but not young individuals (Hvid
et al. 2010, 2014). It is plausible that negative adaptations
induced by disuse and ageing on the neural system were
not fully counteracted by physical retraining in the elderly,
playing a role in the incomplete recovery of muscle
function during fast muscle contraction. In particular,
after physical retraining, co-contraction of ankle muscles
remained similar to that at Post-BR and greater than at
Pre-BRinolderadults(Fig.4),conceivablycontributingto
the impaired muscle power exertion (Reeves et al. 2006a).
In addition, other potential ageing- and disuse-induced
neural adaptations not tested in the present study [i.e. loss
of spinal motor neurons; impaired maximal motor neuron
firing frequency and activation capacity; altered motor
unit recruitment pattern (Klass et al. 2008; Aagaard et al.
2010; Narici & de Boer, 2011)] may not have been restored
by physical retraining, contributing as well to the impaired
muscle power output observed in the elderly during
fast muscle contractions. Interestingly, quadriceps muscle
volume did not completely recover Pre-BR values in older
adults (−3.1%), and an incomplete recovery of contra-
ctile function was also observed in single muscle fibres of
the older participants in partial agreement with previous
observations (Suetta et al. 2009; Hvid et al. 2014). Also,
the present study further supports the view that recovery
of muscle function in older adults is particularly impaired
during fast muscle contractions, because muscle strength
exerted during isometric MVC of the knee extensors was
fully restored after physical retraining in both older adults
and young subjects (Fig. 2A and B). Complete recovery of
muscle strength during isometric MVC in the elderly was
also found after 4 weeks of retraining, which were sub-
sequent to 2 weeks of immobilization (Suetta et al. 2009).
By contrast, shorter retraining (1 week) did not lead to the
same positive outcome, even if the immobilization period
was shorter (4 days) (Hvid et al. 2014).
These findings seem to highlight the role of training
volume as an important determinant for the recovery of
muscle function in the elderly. Along this line, most of the
studies that reported positive neuromuscular adaptations
in the elderly involved a greater number of training
sessions (i.e. �20–45 sessions) than the above mentioned
studies (Reeves et al. 2006a; Reid & Fielding, 2012).
While discussing the lower limb muscle function
recovery observed in the present study, it is also important
to note that the proposed physical training was not
primarily focused on the increment of lower limb muscle
power, but rather to a more global physical improvement.
In fact, more than half of each training session was
devotedtoaerobicexercise,andnoexplosiveorhigh-speed
movements were included during strength exercises.
Interestingly, training interventions that emphasized
explosive power focusing on higher movement speed, even
without requiring specific resistance training equipment,
were safe and effective for improving lower limb muscle
power and physical functioning (i.e. stair climbing) in the
elderly population (Bean et al. 2002, 2004; Reid & Fielding,
2012). Similarly, physical training performed with iso-
tonic weight-resistance machines or inertial load has the
potentialtoincreaselowerlimbmusclestrengthandpower
in elderly individuals (Reeves et al. 2006a,b; Onambele
et al. 2008). Hence, further studies focused on the
retraining of muscle power after a period of disuse should
include higher-speed, power-orientated exercises. The
improvement and recovery of muscle power after disuse in
older adults and elderly individuals is of particular inter-
est in view of its relevance for independent mobility and
quality of life in the elderly population (Reid & Fielding,
2012). In fact, several studies identified lower limb muscle
power as a significant predictor of functional performance
in older adults (reviewed by Reid & Fielding, 2012).
Cognitive training and protein supplementation
did not significantly affect muscle mass and power
in older adults
Two distinct countermeasures, cognitive training and
protein supplementation, were adopted to attenuate the
impact of bed rest and improve recovery, respectively, in
a subgroup of older adult participants. Cognitive training
by navigating through virtual mazes might activate the
same neural systems involved in mobility and this might
produce, in turn, subliminal muscle contractions. An
improved executive/attention ability and processing speed
(Marusic et al. 2018) as well as suppression of the
increase in plasma BDNF concentration (Passaro et al.
2017) have been observed after bed rest in the older

individualsenrolledinthepresentstudywhowereexposed
to cognitive training. However, cognitive training did not
lead to any mitigation of BR-induced loss of muscle mass
and power, as also reported by Passaro et al. (2017), who
additionally analysed the correlation between variations
of explosive power and BDNF plasma levels.
The usefulness of protein supplementation in BR
experiments has been considered in many studies with
mixed results (see Stein & Blanc, 2011), possibly in relation
to the amount and the timing of administration. In
the present BR study, development of insulin resistance
(Pisot et al. 2016) and anabolic resistance (Biolo et al.
2017) were detected. The protein supplementation was
restricted to the physical retraining phase, thus starting
from a condition in which anabolic resistance was present.
No significant effect of protein supplementation on the
recovery of muscle mass and power was found; however,
we cannot rule out the possibility that the lack of effect
was just due to the insufficient amount of protein.
Limitations of the study
Two main outcomes of this study are that (1) the loss
of lower limb muscle power due to disuse was more
pronounced in older adults than in young individuals;
and (2) physical retraining that had the same duration
as disuse was not sufficient to fully recover muscle power
and volume in older adults. However, from a statistical
standpoint, these messages are weakened by the small
number of participants enrolled in this study; this is a
consequence of logistical limitations that are intrinsic to
this type of studies.
Similar limitations are also related to the uneven
sample size of the groups. Also, the fact that only male
subjects were enrolled limits the applicability of the
findings reported in the present study. It should be noted
that women, and particularly post-menopausal women,
can count on lower muscle mass than matched male
subjects, and thus may be more responsive to disuse
than men. Finally, bioelectrical impedance analysis has
some intrinsic limitation for body composition analysis;
however, this methodology was used in the present study
only to describe anthropometric characteristics of the
population, while a more sensitive technique (MRI) was
used for assessing the changes in muscle volume of the
representative lower limb extensor examined (quadriceps
femoris).
Conclusions
Two weeks of disuse decreased the lower limb muscle
power in both young and older individuals. Six physical
training sessions performed in the 2 weeks subsequent
to disuse promoted the recovery of muscle mass and
power; however, they were not sufficient to restore muscle
function to pre-disuse values in older individuals. Also,
countermeasures based on cognitive training and protein
supplementation were not effective for reducing the
impact of disuse and improving physical retraining in
older adults. Taken together, these findings indicate that
susceptibility to the impact of disuse increases with ageing,
and suggest that a greater number of training sessions, the
inclusion of power-orientated exercises and more effective
countermeasures are required to restore muscle mass and
power after 2 weeks of disuse in older individuals.
