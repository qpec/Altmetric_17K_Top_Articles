ABSTRACT 
30 
This study aimed to determine if a quantifiable relationship exists between the peak 
31 
sound amplitude and peak vertical ground reaction force (vGRF) and vertical loading 
32 
rate during running. It also investigated whether differences in; peak sound 
33 
amplitude, contact time, lower limb kinematics, kinetics and foot strike technique 
34 
existed when participants were verbally instructed to run quietly compared to their 
35 
normal running. Twenty-six males completed running trials for two sound 
36 
conditions; normal running and quiet running. Simple linear regressions revealed no 
37 
significant relationships between impact sound and peak vGRF in the normal and 
38 
quiet conditions and vertical loading rate in the normal condition. T-tests revealed 
39 
significant within subject decreases in peak sound, peak vGRF and vertical loading 
40 
rate during the quiet compared to the normal running condition. During the normal 
41 
running condition, 15.4% of participants utilized a non-rearfoot strike technique as 
42 
compared to 76.9% in the quiet condition, which was corroborated by an increased 
43 
ankle plantarflexion angle at initial contact. This study demonstrated that quieter 
44 
impact sound is not directly associated with a lower peak vGRF or vertical loading 
45 
rate. However, given the instructions to run quietly, participants effectively reduced 
46 
peak impact sound, peak vGRF and vertical loading rate.

INTRODUCTION 
53 
Running is a popular sport, however the prevalence of lower limb injuries has been 
54 
reported to be between 19% to 79% in long distance runners.(Van Gent et al., 2007) 
55 
Although risk factors for injuries in runners are multifaceted,(Fredericson, Jennings, 
56 
Beaulieu, & Matheson, 2006) ground reaction forces and vertical loading rate on 
57 
impact have been the focus of many studies that investigate the mechanisms of 
58 
injuries in runners. (Davis, Bowser, & Mullineaux, In Press; Ferber, Davis, Hamill, 
59 
Pollard, & McKeown, 2002; Grimston, Engsberg, Kloiber, & Hanley, 1991; Milner, 
60 
Ferber, Pollard, Hamill, & Davis, 2006; van der Worp, Vrielink, & Bredeweg, In 
61 
Press; Zadpoor & Nikooyan, 2011) Cross-sectional studies have demonstrated that 
62 
runners with previous stress fractures have a significantly greater peak vertical 
63 
ground reaction force (vGRF) and vertical loading rate compared to runners with no 
64 
history of stress fractures.(Ferber et al., 2002; Grimston et al., 1991; Milner et al., 
65 
2006) A recent prospective study by Davis et al. found that female runners with 
66 
greater vGRF impact peaks and loading rate experienced a greater number of 
67 
medically diagnosed stress fractures and muscles strain injuries.(Davis et al., In 
68 
Press) Interventions aimed at reducing vGRF and vertical loading rate should 
69 
therefore be investigated to potentially reduce lower limb injuries in runners.  
70 
 
71 
In a case-series by Cheung and Davis (2011) a novel intervention was employed to 
72 
decrease vertical loading rate in three female runners with patellofemoral pain. In 
73 
this study, the runners used an audio biofeedback device affixed to the heel of their 
74 
shoe insole that emitted a sound whenever their heel contacted the ground. This 
75 
audio feedback guided them in changing their foot strike technique from a rearfoot 
76 
strike (RFS) to a non-RFS. In changing their foot strike, vertical loading rate and 
77 
 5 
 
knee pain were significantly reduced. The results of this study provide preliminary 
78 
evidence to support the use of auditory feedback to alter running kinetics and reduce 
79 
injury symptoms.  
80 
 
81 
Anecdotally, some running coaches already use the sound of impact during running 
82 
as auditory feedback to change habitual RFS runners’ to a non-RFS technique with 
83 
the intention of altering ground reaction forces and injury risk. Despite no 
84 
established link between foot strike technique and injury incidence, injury location 
85 
has been shown to vary between RFS and non-RFS runners (Walther, 2005) which 
86 
may in part be related to the different vGRF profiles they elicit. Rearfoot strike 
87 
runners typically create a vGRF impact peak while non-RFS (forefoot) runners only 
88 
create an active vGRF peak.(Boyer, Rooney, & Derrick, 2014) However, to the best 
89 
of the authors’ knowledge, no studies have investigated the amplitude of impact 
90 
sound during different foot strike techniques and the effect verbal instructions to 
91 
change the sound of impact has on lower limb kinematics and kinetics and 
92 
furthermore whether verbal instruction causes a change in the runners foot strike. 
93 
 
94 
Literature has lent support to the use of verbal instructions to change the sound of 
95 
impact in drop landings, which resulted in altered kinematics and kinetics. McNair, 
96 
Prapavessis, and Callender (2000) and Prapavessis and McNair (1999) demonstrated 
97 
that healthy adults and children, respectively, were able to significantly decrease 
98 
their peak vGRF during drop landings when using impact sound as a qualitative 
99 
feedback mechanism. This task was performed initially with no instructions 
100 
regarding sound and then repeated with the instruction to try and land more “softly”. 
101 
Therefore, it was postulated that impact sound and peak vGRF are related 
102 
 6 
 
qualitatively during drop landings.(McNair, Prapavessis, & Callender, 2000; Milner, 
103 
Fairbrother, Srivatsan, & Zhang, 2012) Recently, Wernli, Ng, Phan, Davey, & 
104 
Grisbrook (2016) established a quantitative relationship between peak impact sound 
105 
amplitude and vGRF during drop landing, with the higher impact sound amplitude, 
106 
the greater the vGRF and vice versa.(Wernli et al., 2016)  Little is known about the 
107 
relationship between sound and peak vGRF or vertical loading rate during more 
108 
complex locomotive tasks such as running.  
109 
  
110 
Therefore, the primary aim of this study was to investigate if a quantitative 
111 
relationship exists between peak sound amplitude, peak vGRF and vertical loading 
112 
rate during barefoot running. It was hypothesized that a small impact sound 
113 
amplitude during running would be associated with a small peak vGRF and vertical 
114 
loading rate and vice versa. The secondary aim of this study was to investigate if 
115 
there were any significant differences in; peak sound amplitude, vGRF, vertical 
116 
loading rate, contact time and lower limb kinematics (more specifically; ankle, knee 
117 
and hip sagittal plane joint angles at initial contact and peak) when runners were 
118 
asked to run quietly compared to their normal running technique. It was 
119 
hypothesized that when asked to run quietly, runners would decrease their; peak 
120 
sound amplitude, vGRF, vertical loading rate and contact time. It was further 
121 
hypothesized that habitual RFS runners would increase their plantarflexion angle at 
122 
initial contact and thereby change to a non-RFS technique, but that the joint 
123 
kinematics of non-RFS runner’s would be unaffected.

METHODS 
126 
Participants 
127 
Twenty-six healthy male participants were recruited from the local community and 
128 
via word of mouth. Participants were excluded if they had an allergy to tape, a 
129 
history of lower limb surgery or injuries of musculoskeletal origin within the six 
130 
weeks prior to data collection.  
131 
 
132 
Instrumentation 
133 
An 18-camera Vicon MX motion analysis system (Oxford Metrics, Inc.), sampling at 
134 
250 Hz, and an AMTI (Watertown, MA) force plate, sampling at 1000 Hz, were used 
135 
to collect the kinematic and kinetic data.(Szczerbik & Kalinowska, 2011) A 
136 
Sennheiser ME66 shotgun microphone (Wedermark, Germany) with a K6 powering 
137 
module connected to the Vicon Nexus software, sampling at the maximum 24 kHz, 
138 
was used to collect impact sound data in voltage (V). Impact sound was defined as 
139 
the peak sound that was created between the runners’ foot and the ground during the 
140 
weight acceptance phase of running. The shotgun microphone was positioned on the 
141 
same side as the striking leg (right) and the tip of the microphone was at a 
142 
standardized 300 mm distance away from the centre of the force plate. The position 
143 
of the microphone was determined during pilot testing such that the microphone was 
144 
placed as close as possible to the participants’ contact foot without interfering with 
145 
the run, to ensure a consistent sound amplitude was captured. A Rion NL-11 sound 
146 
calibrator (Tokyo, Japan), which provided a consistent 94.1dB amplitude sound, was 
147 
used to enable calibration of the sound recorded from the microphone from voltages 
148 
to decibels. Measures were taken during testing to ensure that background noise was 
149 
 8 
 
minimal; the motion analysis laboratory where all the testing was conducted is 
150 
located in an isolated building, all testing was conducted outside of work hours and a 
151 
unidirectional microphone was used. 
152 
 
153 
Procedure 
154 
Ethical approval was obtained from the institution’s Human Research Ethics 
155 
Committee and all participants provided written informed consent prior to 
156 
participation. Data collection occurred at the institution’s Motion Analysis 
157 
Laboratory, where participants’ measurement of body height and mass, ankle width, 
158 
leg length, knee width, wrist width, hand thickness, elbow width, and shoulder offset 
159 
were taken to calibrate the Vicon Plug in Gait system (Oxford Metrics, Inc). Each 
160 
participant was then fitted with the Vicon full body Plug-in-Gait retro reflective 
161 
marker set and allowed ten minutes to perform a standardized warm-up. The warm-
162 
up consisted of five minutes of run throughs, walking lunges, high knees and 
163 
bounding tasks, with retro-reflective markers in place. This ensured that the 
164 
participants were familiar with the laboratory environment and the speed of running 
165 
required in this study.  
166 
 
167 
Each participant was required to perform a series of barefoot running trials with the 
168 
instruction to run in a straight line from one marker to another, which were 
169 
positioned 10 m apart. The runway was a hard surface that consisted of a vinyl sports 
170 
flooring over concrete and a predominantly aluminium AMTI force platform. The 
171 
starting marker was positioned so that the participant would strike the force plate 
172 
with their right foot to achieve a successful trial. However, the participant was not 
173 
informed of the location of the force plate to avoid them altering their running style 
174 
 9 
 
to target it. Running velocity was calculated by tracking the right Anterior Superior 
175 
Iliac Spine marker using the Vicon system to confirm the participants were running 
176 
at a velocity of 5.0 ± 0.5 m/s. This running speed was chosen as it has been used in 
177 
various running studies, as outlined in a systematic review by Schache et al. (2010). 
178 
Trials in which the running speed was not achieved or the participant failed to make 
179 
full foot contact on the force plate were deemed unsuccessful and removed from the 
180 
sample group. The number of trials was limited to ten per condition and participants 
181 
were given two minutes rest between trials to avoid fatigue.  
182 
 
183 
The running task was performed under two different sound conditions: normal and 
184 
quiet. The normal sound condition was always performed first so that a baseline 
185 
measurement of running sound could be obtained. For the normal sound condition, 
186 
the researchers only provided instruction on how to perform the task without any 
187 
reference to sound as described above. For the quiet sound condition, participants 
188 
were asked to “perform the task as before but this time make a quieter sound when 
189 
you land”. These instructions were derived from a similar study regarding qualitative 
190 
relationship of impact sound and landing forces in drop-landing studies (McNair et 
191 
al., 2000; Wernli et al., 2016). Five successful trials were recorded for each sound 
192 
condition, with a one-minute rest period after each condition to minimise the effect 
193 
of fatigue.  
194 
 
195 
Data management  
196 
The Vicon Nexus software (v1.7.1, Vicon Motion Analysis Systems) was used to 
197 
manage the anthropometric data and inspect for any breaks that may occur due to 
198 
marker occlusion. A Woltering filtering routine was then performed. The Vicon 
199 
 10 
 
Plug-in-Gait model (Oxford Metrics, Inc.) was then utilized to calculate kinematic 
200 
and kinetic variables. Sound data collected from the shotgun microphone was 
201 
converted from V to dB via a custom-written program developed in LabVIEW 
202 
v2011 SP1 (National instruments, Texas). Sound amplitude was calculated using the 
203 
equation; 
204 
20*LOG10 (V2/V1),                                            (Eq.1) 
205 
where V1 is the Root Mean Square of the voltage recorded for the 94.1 dB standard 
206 
and V2 is the voltage reading collected by the microphone.(Rao, 2010) Peak impact 
207 
sound amplitude, peak vGRF, vertical loading rate, contact time and sagittal plane 
208 
joint kinematic data (ankle, knee and hip angle at initial contact, and peak ankle and 
209 
knee angle) were then extracted via a separate custom-written program developed in 
210 
LabVIEW.  
211 
 
212 
Vertical loading rate was calculated as the change in vGRF from the first frame it 
213 
exceeded 200 N to where it reached 90% of the impact peak magnitude, this was 
214 
calculated with respect to time. If no impact peak was present, the average 
215 
percentage of stance that 90% of the impact peak typically occurred was used 
216 
(5.3%). This method of calculating loading rate has been previously utilized in the 
217 
running literature. (Caulfield et al., In Press; Lieberman, Venkadesan, & Werbel, 
218 
2010) Following the loading rate calculation vGRF data was normalized to body 
219 
mass and then time normalized to 101 data points.  
220 
 
221 
Foot strike technique was determined in Vicon using markers placed on the 
222 
participant’s right heel and toe. The vertical height offset between these markers was 
223 
calculated during standing. This offset was then applied to the markers at initial 
224 
 11 
 
contact during running trials to determine the technique. If the toe marker was higher 
225 
than the heel marker at initial contact it was classified as a RFS and if the heel 
226 
marker was higher it was classified as a non-RFS. The non-RFS group included both 
227 
midfoot and forefoot strike techniques. Foot strike technique was determined for 
228 
each running trial.    
229 
 
230 
Statistical Analysis 
231 
IBM SPSS Statistics for Windows Version 22 (IBM Corp, 2013, Armonk, NY) was 
232 
used for the statistical analysis. Descriptive statistics were performed for the 
233 
participant demographics. A Chi-Square test was conducted to examine if there were 
234 
any significant difference in foot strike technique used by the participants between 
235 
the normal and quiet running conditions. 
236 
 
237 
The within subject reliability of the dependent variables across the five running trials 
238 
for each of the running conditions was assessed by calculating the intra-class 
239 
correlation coefficient (ICC 3,5) using a two-way mixed effects model. An ICC value 
240 
of <0.75 was interpreted as moderate, 0.75-0.89 as high, and ≥ 0.9 as excellent 
241 
(Landis & Koch, 1977).   
242 
 
243 
Individual mean values from the five successful running trials from each sound 
244 
condition were calculated for each of the dependent variables including; peak impact 
245 
sound amplitude, peak vGRF, vertical loading rate, contact time, ankle knee and hip 
246 
angle at initial contact, and peak ankle and knee angle. The normality of these 
247 
variables were assessed using the Shapiro-Wilk test and all variables were found to 
248 
be normally distributed. Two separate simple linear regression analyses were 
249 
 12 
 
conducted to determine the coefficients of determination (r2) between; peak impact 
250 
sound amplitude and peak vGRF, and peak impact sound amplitude and vertical 
251 
loading rate. A series of paired samples t-tests were then conducted to determine if 
252 
there were any within-subject differences in the dependent variables between the 
253 
normal and quiet running conditions. The alpha level was set to p < 0.05 for all 
254 
analyses.  
255 
RESULTS 
256 
 
257 
Participants 
258 
Twenty-six healthy males aged 21.1  2.0 years old were recruited. They were on 
259 
average 1.79  0.05 m tall, and 78.3  12.2 kg in body mass. During the normal 
260 
running condition, 22 of the participants (84.6%) utilized a RFS technique, and four 
261 
participants (15.4%) used a non-RFS technique. When instructed to run quietly, 16 
262 
of the 22 RFS runners adopted a non-RFS, with six participants maintaining a RFS. 
263 
All four of the non-RFS runners maintained this technique during the quiet running 
264 
condition. Therefore, 76.9% of the participants utilized a non-RFS during the quiet 
265 
running condition. The results of the Chi- square confirmed that there was a 
266 
significant difference in foot strike pattern between the normal and quiet running 
267 
condition (Chi- square = 19.81, p < 0.001).  
268 
 
269 
Within subject reliability  
270 
The ICC’s for each of the dependent variables for both of the running conditions are 
271 
presented in Table 1. All variables were found to have high or excellent within 
272 
subject reliability for both the normal and quiet running conditions, with the 
273 
 13 
 
exception of peak knee angle during the normal running condition, which had low 
274 
reliability.

Relationship between peak impact sound and kinetics 
279 
The time-normalized vGRF during the stance phase of running under the two sound 
280 
conditions is presented in Figure 1. In general, there was an impact peak during the 
281 
normal running condition, while the quiet running condition displayed only an active 
282 
vGRF peak. Separate simple linear regressions were calculated to predict peak vGRF 
283 
based on peak impact sound in normal and quiet conditions. No significant 
284 
relationships were found in the normal condition (F(1, 24) = 1.102, p=0.304, 95%CI; 
285 
-0.012, 0.037; r2 of 0.044) or the quiet condition peak (F(1, 24) = 0.327, p=0.573, 
286 
95%CI; -0.014, 0.025 r2 of 0.013 ). Separate simple linear regressions were also 
287 
calculated to predict peak vertical loading rate based on peak impact sound in normal 
288 
and quiet conditions. No significant relationship was found in the normal condition 
289 
(F(1, 24) = 2.211, p=0.150, 95%CI = -3.855, 23.729 r2 is 0.084). However a 
290 
significant regression was found to predict vertical loading rate based on peak impact 
291 
sound in the quiet condition (F(1,24) = 5.476, p=0.028, 95%CI;1.055, 16.825 r2 of 
292 
0.186). The participants predicted vertical loading rate (BW/sec) = -888.0 + (8.940 x 
293 
peak impact sound (dB)) in the quiet condition. (Figure 2B) Participant’s average 
294 
vertical loading rate increases by 8.9 BW/sec for every dB increase in sound.

Difference in sound, kinematics and kinetics between running conditions

The paired samples t-tests demonstrated that peak sound amplitude (mean difference 
301 
= 9.1 dB, p < 0.001), peak vGRF (mean difference = 0.2 BW, p = 0.001), and 
302 
vertical loading rate (mean difference = 275.1 BW/sec, p < 0.001) were significantly 
303 
lower during the quiet running condition compared with the normal running 
304 
condition (Table 2). Figure 3 shows the time-normalized ankle, knee and hip joint 
305 
sagittal motion during the stance phase of running under the two sound conditions. 
306 
Ankle angle changed from 0.2° dorsiflexion at initial contact during normal running 
307 
to 8.6° plantarflexion during quiet running (p < 0.001, Table 2) and hip flexion at 
308 
initial contact was greater in the normal compared to the quiet condition (mean 
309 
difference = 2.2˚, p = 0.039, Table 2). Peak ankle dorsiflexion (mean difference = 
310 
3.5˚, p = 0.001) and peak knee flexion (mean difference = 2.6˚, p = 0.014) angles 
311 
were significantly reduced in the quiet condition compared with the normal running 
312 
condition. There was no significant difference in contact time (p = 0.712) and knee 
313 
angle at initial contact (p = 0.883), between the normal and quiet running conditions 
314 
(Table 2).

DISCUSSION 
319 
The results of this study demonstrate that individuals can significantly reduce their 
320 
peak vGRF, vertical loading rate and peak sound amplitude when instructed to run 
321 
quietly. When running quietly runners were also more likely to use a non-RFS than a 
322 
 15 
 
RFS technique and exhibited the vGRF profile and lower limb kinematics to support 
323 
this. However, despite the significant effect running quietly has on an individual’s 
324 
vGRF and vertical loading rate, this effect cannot be generalized. We found weak 
325 
and mostly insignificant correlations between peak impact sound and peak vGRF 
326 
and vertical loading rate. Therefore, a quieter impact sound is not directly associated 
327 
with a lower peak vGRF or vertical loading rate.  
328 
 
329 
This is the first study to investigate impact sound during running and hence there is 
330 
no literature to directly compare our results. Wernli et al. (2016) examined the 
331 
impact sound during a drop-landing task where participants were asked to land 
332 
normally, softly and loudly and they found a significant relationship between peak 
333 
impact sound and peak vGRF. An explanation for why Wernli et al. (2016) found a 
334 
significant relationship where the current study did not may be that they combined 
335 
the results of their three sound conditions into one regression model rather than 
336 
conducting individual analyses. The contrasting findings may also be owing to the 
337 
fact that running is a more complex motor skill than drop-landing. Additionally, the 
338 
participants in the current study had not received any formal running coaching; it is 
339 
therefore likely that individual technique variation existed between trials. However, 
340 
despite the fact participants were not highly trained runners, intra-class correlation 
341 
coefficients (Table 1) for all variables recorded were high. A stronger relationship 
342 
between impact sound and peak vGRF and vertical loading rate may exist in well-
343 
trained runners, however this requires further investigation. 
344 
 
345 
Numerous studies have confirmed that runners who have previously experienced a 
346 
lower limb stress fracture have greater peak vGRF and vertical loading rates than 
347 
 16 
 
uninjured runners (Ferber et al., 2002; Grimston et al., 1991; Milner et al., 2006). 
348 
More recently, a prospective study by Davis et al. (Davis et al., In Press) found that 
349 
runners with greater peak vGRF and vertical loading rates experienced a greater 
350 
number of stress fractures and muscle strains than runners who had never been 
351 
medically diagnosed with an injury. This suggests that these GRF variables are risk 
352 
factors for injury rather than a result of changed movement patterns following the 
353 
injury. The results of the current study may have significant implications for athletes, 
354 
as it demonstrated that ‘loud’ runners do not necessarily have greater peak vGRF and 
355 
vertical loading rates than ‘quiet’ runners. Nevertheless individuals can reduce their 
356 
vGRF and vertical loading rate simply by running quietly, however whether this type 
357 
of intervention can effectively reduce running injuries requires further investigation.  
358 
 
359 
Lower limb kinematics were altered when runners were instructed to run quietly. 
360 
Most notably the average ankle angle at initial contact changed from a dorsiflexion 
361 
angle to plantarflexion when participants ran quietly (normal 0.2° dorsiflexion vs 
362 
quiet 8.6° plantarflexion, p < 0.001). The changes in ankle angle at initial contact 
363 
suggest that when participants were instructed to run quietly, majority adopted a 
364 
non-RFS running pattern. This was confirmed by the foot marker positions recorded 
365 
in Vicon. Ankle range of motion also increased during the quiet condition (normal 
366 
27.7° vs quiet 33.0°), and peak ankle dorsiflexion, peak knee flexion and hip flexion 
367 
at initial contact decreased from the normal to quiet condition, these changes are all 
368 
consistent with a change from a RFS to a non-RFS technique (Kulmala, Avela, 
369 
Pasanen, & Parkkari, 2013; Nunns, House, Fallowfield, Allsopp, & Dixon, 2013). 
370 
Adding further support, only one peak was evident in the vGRF (Figure 1) in the 
371 
quiet running condition compared to two seen in the normal condition, which is 
372 
 17 
 
consistent with a non-RFS technique (Bobbert, Schamhardt, & Nigg, 1991; Boyer et 
373 
al., 2014; Rooney & Derrick, 2013). Anecdotally, some coaches already instruct 
374 
their athletes to run softly in order to change from a RFS to a non-RFS technique, 
375 
and the results of the current study suggest that this may be effective. Although, 
376 
while this study found that an imposed non-RFS technique initially produces a 
377 
quieter sound than a habitual RFS, whether this effect is long term and whether a 
378 
habitual non-RFS is quieter than a habitual RFS is unknown. It is also important to 
379 
note that not all habitual RFS participants changed to a non-RFS when asked to run 
380 
quietly yet were still able achieved a reduction in impact sound, peak vGRF and 
381 
vertical loading rate. Changing foot strike technique is therefore not the only 
382 
mechanism for reducing these variables. How participants who did not change 
383 
technique reduced impact sound warrants further investigation.  
384 
 
385 
Participants in this study ran barefoot in both the normal and quiet conditions, this 
386 
was enforced in order to control for variable shoe cushioning and support 
387 
characteristics. A possible limitation of barefoot running however is the difference in 
388 
tissue composition between the heel pad and forefoot, which may alter the impact 
389 
sound. Although as mentioned previously not all participants changed to a non-RFS 
390 
when asked to run quietly yet still reduced their impact sound suggests that the 
391 
influence of varied foot composition was minimal. Future research should 
392 
investigate if the results of this study are repeatable when wearing shoes and on 
393 
varied surfaces. Softer surfaces (such as grass) and shoe midsole cushioning will 
394 
increase the time over which contact occurs and therefore vertical loading rate may 
395 
be reduced, which based on the findings of the current study we postulate will also 
396 
reduce impact sound amplitude. 
397 
 18 
 
 
398 
This study was conducted in a laboratory setting where background noise was 
399 
minimal and the sound created at foot contact during both the normal and quiet 
400 
running conditions was clearly audible to the assessor and the shotgun microphone 
401 
collected clean raw data. While the authors feel that the laboratory nature of the 
402 
study allowed for the collection of quality data they acknowledge that the findings 
403 
may be limited to a metallic surface (force platform). The results may also be limited 
404 
to amateur male barefoot runners running at 5.0 m/s. It is very likely that different 
405 
surfaces, footwear, speeds and running ability will alter the impact sound amplitude. 
406 
We postulate that due to the effect of speed on vGRF (Hamner & Delp, 2013) when 
407 
individuals run slower they will generate a quieter impact sound and when they run 
408 
faster (whilst maintaining a habitual RFS) a louder sound. Based on our results we 
409 
believe this will be an individual response and not a general relationship. 
410 
Furthermore, for practical application it is important to determine whether an athlete 
411 
or a coach can detect differences in sound amplitude without the use of an expensive 
412 
microphone. Future research should investigate runners of different abilities, female 
413 
runners, different surfaces, shod running, running speeds and an outdoor 
414 
environment.   
415 
 
416 
Conclusion 
417 
This study demonstrated that running quietly is not directly associated with a lower 
418 
vGRF or vertical loading rate. However, when healthy male participants were asked 
419 
to intentionally run quietly, compared to their normal running, peak impact sound 
420 
amplitude, peak vGRF and vertical loading rate were reduced. This may have 
421 
important injury prevention implications for coaches, athletes and clinicians.
