Expression of androgen receptor (AR) in prostate cancer (PCa) is heterogeneous but the
functional significance of AR heterogeneity remains unclear. Screening ~200 castration-
resistant PCa (CRPC) cores and whole-mount sections (from 89 patients) reveals 3 AR
expression patterns: nuclear (nuc-AR), mixed nuclear/cytoplasmic (nuc/cyto-AR), and low/
no expression (AR−/lo). Xenograft modeling demonstrates that AR+ CRPC is enzalutamide-
sensitive but AR−/lo CRPC is resistant. Genome editing-derived AR+ and AR-knockout
LNCaP cell clones exhibit distinct biological and tumorigenic properties and contrasting
responses to enzalutamide. RNA-Seq and biochemical analyses, coupled with experimental
combinatorial therapy, identify BCL-2 as a critical therapeutic target and provide proof-of-
concept therapeutic regimens for both AR+/hi and AR−/lo CRPC. Our study links AR
expression heterogeneity to distinct castration/enzalutamide responses and has important
implications in understanding the cellular basis of prostate tumor responses to AR-targeting
therapies and in facilitating development of novel therapeutics to target AR−/lo PCa cells/
clones.

 A
ndrogen receptor (AR), a steroid hormone receptor nor-
mally activated by androgens, plays an essential role in
prostate cancer (PCa) development, progression, and
therapy response1. Most PCa patients are first treated by radical
prostatectomy and/or radiation therapy. When post treatment
serum PSA (prostate-specific antigen) levels rise, the patient is
treated by first-line androgen deprivation therapy (ADT) using
GnRH analogs, which suppress gonadal production of testoster-
one (T), and PCa cells at this stage are castration sensitive
(Supplementary Fig. 1a). Increasing PSA levels indicate the
recurrence of primary castration-resistant PCa (CRPC) and the
patient is then put on second-line regimens to suppress AR
function (using enzalutamide; Enza) and/or block adrenal
androgen biosynthesis (using abiraterone). Patients will even-
tually experience Enza-resistant secondary CRPC with a shorter
interval due to acquired resistance (Supplementary Fig. 1a).
Molecular mechanisms underlying (primary) castration and
(secondary) Enza resistance are incompletely understood.
Both chemical castration (using ADT and abiraterone) and
antiandrogens (Enza and early-generation drugs such as bicalu-
tamide) target AR signaling. However, human PCa is hetero-
geneous containing both AR-expressing (AR+), as well as AR
low-expressing or non-expressing (AR−/lo) cells and this AR
heterogeneity is accentuated in advanced metastatic and relapsed
PCa2–14. Whether the heterogeneity in AR expression levels
impacts PCa biology and therapy response remains unclear. This
project is undertaken to address this important question and to
fill a critical gap in our knowledge. Through extensive xenograft
modeling, development of AR-tagged (AR+) and AR-knockout
(KO) LNCaP cell clones, and performing in vitro biological and
in vivo tumor regeneration assays, RNA-Seq, and multiple
combinatorial therapeutic experiments, we link the AR expression
status to distinct tumorigenic behavior and castration/Enza
responses. Critically, our studies uncover signaling molecules and
pathways underlying the development of, and also establish
proof-of-principle therapeutic regimens targeting, the two distinct
castration resistance modes mediated by AR+/hi and AR−/lo PCa
cells, respectively.
Results
Three distinct expression patterns of AR in CRPC. We first
assess AR expression levels and distribution patterns in sections
from 3 tissue microarrays (TMAs) that contain 195 CRPC cores
derived from 81 patient CRPC samples (Fig. 1a–c; Supplementary
Fig. 1b-d), most of which are the prostates treated in the pre-Enza
era
(Supplementary
Data
1).
Immuno-histochemical
(IHC)
staining of AR using an N-terminally directed monoclonal anti-
body (ab74272; Supplementary Table 1), which would recognize
full-length AR and all C-terminal truncated variants, reveals 3
distinct patterns of AR expression (Fig. 1a, b; Supplementary
Fig. 1b, c): (1) primarily nuclear AR (nuc-AR+/hi; 49 cores, or 25%
of the total); (2) both nuclear and cytoplasmic AR (nuc/cyto-AR;
77 cores or 39% of the total), and (3) lack of appreciable AR
expression (AR−/lo; 52 cores, ~27% of the total). The remaining 17
cores (9%) contain both AR+ and AR−/lo cells (Fig. 1b; Supple-
mentary Fig 1c). Similar IHC analysis of AR in 8 whole-mount
(WM) CRPC sections (Supplementary Data 1) shows that 7 sam-
ples display the 3 AR patterns in the same specimen (Fig. 1c;
Supplementary Fig. 1d) whereas 1 sample is largely AR−/lo. These
results reveal the AR heterogeneity in both expression levels and
subcellular distribution patterns in patient CRPC.
Four xenograft CRPC models recapitulate the three AR pat-
terns. Our laboratory has been using 4 AR+ PCa xenograft
models,
i.e.,
LAPC9,
LAPC4,
LNCaP,
and
VCaP11,14–17.
Interestingly, when these 4 models transition from androgen-
dependent (AD, i.e., androgen-sensitive) to a castration-resistant
(CR; androgen-independent or AI) state during serial propaga-
tion in castrated mice (Fig. 1d; Methods), CR tumors display the
same 3 AR immunostaining patterns observed in the clinical
CRPC specimens (Fig. 1e; Supplementary Fig. 2). Specifically,
IHC analysis using two antibodies against the N-terminus of AR
reveals that CR LNCaP tumors show mainly nuc-AR+/hi, LAPC4
and VCaP nuc/cyto-AR, and LAPC9 AR−/lo phenotypes (Fig. 1e;
Supplementary Fig. 2). All 4 CR tumors stain negative for neu-
roendocrine (NE) markers synaptophysin and chromogranin A
using monoclonal antibodies (Supplementary Table 1). As our
AD→CR xenograft models induced by surgical castration and
serial propagation in castrated mice mimic first-line clinical ADT
using GnRH agonists18,19, we term the resultant CR tumors
primary (1°) CRPC (Fig. 1d). As we shall present below (Fig. 1f),
the 1° AR+/hi and AR−/lo CRPC xenografts display distinct
responses to Enza.
Characterization of multiple proteins involved in AR signaling,
cancer stem cells (CSC), and castration resistance in 1° CRPC
reveal changes unique to each model (Fig. 2; Supplementary
Table 2). In LAPC9 CRPC, castration leads to a prominent
decrease/loss of AR and its two targets PSA and FKBP5 (Fig. 2a),
and no AR splice variants including AR-V7 are observed in either
AD or CR tumors. Among the “CSC and castration resistance”
molecules examined, the LAPC9 CRPC upregulates N-Cadherin,
BCL-2, p-ERK1/2, c-Myc, and integrin α2 (Fig. 2a; Supplemen-
tary Table 2). In contrast, GR (glucocorticoid receptor), p-AKT
and ALDH7A1, p-Stat3 and E-Cadherin are similar or slightly
reduced between AD and CR tumors (Fig. 2a; Supplementary
Table 2). In the LAPC4 model, castration results in a slight
increase in AR but decreases in PSA and FKBP5 (Fig. 2a). The
LAPC4 1° CRPC upregulates GR, N-Cadherin, BCL-2, and
integrin α2 but p-AKT, ALDH7A1, and p-Stat3 are decreased
whereas p-ERK1/2 demonstrates transient increases (Fig. 2a;
Supplementary Table 2). VCaP 1° CRPC shows increased AR,
AR-V7, PSA, and GR but decreased BCL-2, N-Cadherin, p-
ERK1/2, c-Myc and p-Stat3, whereas p-AKT and E-cadherin
levels remain unchanged (Fig. 2b; Supplementary Table 2). In the
LNCaP model, castration leads to increased AR but not AR splice
variants including AR-V7 (Fig. 2b). N-Cadherin is not detected,
GR shows only transient changes, and p-AKT and E-cadherin
decrease slightly (Fig. 2b). pERK1/2 and integrin α2 increase then
decline whereas BCL-2 and p-Stat3 demonstrate sustained
increases (Fig. 2b; Supplementary Table 2). All 4 models of 1°
CRPC do not express synaptophysin and chromogranin A.
Collectively, LNCaP, LAPC4, and VCaP 1° CRPC remain AR+and
manifest changes associated with steroid receptor (AR, GR)
signaling whereas the LAPC9 1° CRPC becomes AR−/loand shows
a prominent upregulation of CSC molecules.
The AR−/lo LAPC9 CRPC resists Enza treatment de novo.
When the 4 distinct 1° CRPC models are treated with the second-
line antiandrogen Enza (Supplementary Fig. 1a), they show
strikingly different Enza responses unique to each model (Fig. 1f).
In the nuc-AR+/hi LNCaP model, 1° CRPC is sensitive to Enza for
up to ~7 weeks after which Enza-resistant tumors emerge
(Fig. 1f). The nuc/cyto-AR LAPC4 and VCaP 1° CRPC, both of
which grow more slowly than LNCaP 1° CRPC, initially respond
to Enza but become Enza-resistant around 6.5 and 13 weeks,
respectively (Fig. 1f). These therapeutic outcomes indicate that
the AR+ LNCaP, VCaP, and LAPC4 1° CRPC models remain
AR-dependent and Enza-sensitive but rapidly become Enza-
resistant (i.e., secondary/2° CRPC). In stark contrast, the AR−/lo
LAPC9 1° CRPC (Fig. 1e, Fig. 2a; Supplementary Fig. 2) is

 Enza-resistant de novo (Fig. 1f). Notably, the Enza resistance
observed in LAPC9 1° CRPC is not due to ‘intrinsic’ resistance of
the LAPC9 model to ADT as the LAPC9 AD tumors are exqui-
sitely castration-sensitive11,20. These therapeutic experiments in
CRPC models directly link AR expression levels to Enza sensitivity
and predict that AR−/loPCa cells present in patient tumors may
also be Enza-resistant.
Establishing AR+ and AR-knockout LNCaP cell clones. As the
above AR+ and AR−/lo PCa xenograft models have different
genetic backgrounds, we employ genome-editing technologies to
generate genetically matched AR-tagged (AR+) and AR knockout
(AR-KO) LNCaP clonal cells to compare their intrinsic biological
and tumorigenic properties, as well as responses to castration and
Enza. Briefly, we adopt the zinc-finger nuclease mediated inte-
gration to insert an RFP reporter into the endogenous AR locus
and have generated AR+ (AR-RFP+) LNCaP clones (Supple-
mentary Figs. 3-4; Supplementary Note 1; Methods). Meanwhile,
we utilize the CRISPR-cas9 system to generate AR-KO LNCaP
clones (Supplementary Fig. 5; Supplementary Note 1; Methods).
The AR+ clones are positive for RFP (Supplementary Fig. 3e) and
express high levels of nuclear AR protein in all cells (Supple-
mentary Fig. 6a). siRNA-mediated AR knockdown leads to dra-
matically reduced RFP+ cells (Supplementary Fig. 4a), suggesting
that RFP is co-expressed with endogenous AR and that the RFP
signal reports AR expression. In contrast, the AR-KO LNCaP
clones lack detectable AR expression by immunofluorescence (IF)
(Supplementary Fig. 6b) and the ~110 kD full-length AR protein
by western blot analysis (Supplementary Fig. 5d; Supplementary
Fig. 6c). Consistently, quantitative RT-PCR (qPCR) analysis fails
to detect AR mRNA expression in AR-KO LNCaP cells (Sup-
plementary Fig. 6d). Two methods, i.e., AR target gene expression
(Supplementary Fig. 6c-d) and luciferase reporter assays (Sup-
plementary Fig. 6e-f) are utilized to compare AR activities in AR+
and AR-KO clones. qPCR analysis reveals no PSA mRNA
expression in AR-KO clones (Supplementary Fig. 6c), and wes-
tern blotting analysis shows undetectable levels of PSA protein
and much reduced levels of NKX3.1 and TMPRSS2 in AR-KO
compared to AR-RFP+ LNCaP cells (Supplementary Fig. 6d). To

 test the canonical ligand-activated AR activity, ARE and PSA
luciferase reporter assays are performed in AR-KO and AR+ cells
with and without 10 nM DHT (dihydrotestosterone) treatment.
Lower baseline (i.e., in the absence of DHT), as well as DHT-
stimulated reporter activities are observed in the AR-KO cells
compared to AR+ cells (Supplementary Fig. 6e-f; Supplementary
Note 1). Taken together, these results indicate that AR-KO
LNCaP cells lack full-length AR protein expression and demon-
strate much reduced target gene expression and blunted androgen
responses.
Differences in tumorigenicity in AR+ vs. AR-KO LNCaP cells.
Comparing the intrinsic biological properties, as well as tumor-
regenerating potential in AR+ and AR-KO cells in different
androgen environments, we find that AR+ LNCaP clones display
higher clonal and sphere-forming potential in DHT-containing
media compared to AR-KO clones (Supplementary Fig. 7a, b),
which is associated with higher proliferation in AR+ cells (Sup-
plementary Fig. 7c). Consequently, AR+ clones demonstrate
higher tumorigenicity (i.e., generating more and larger tumors)
than AR-KO clones in intact NOD/SCID (Fig. 3a) and NOD/
SCID-γ (NSG) (Fig. 3b) mice. When AR+ and AR-KO clones are
implanted side-by-side in the same NSG recipient mouse sup-
plemented with exogenous T, AR+ LNCaP cells, strikingly,
regenerate many more and significantly larger tumors than AR-
KO cells (Fig. 3c–f; Student’s t-test for weight comparisons). AR+
cell-derived tumors all retain an AR+ phenotype (Fig. 3g). These
side-by-side comparative studies in androgen-proficient condi-
tions and hosts indicate that, as expected, AR+, but not AR-KO,
PCa cells respond to androgen stimulation in vitro and in vivo.
The results also imply that androgens (DHT) may preferentially
suppress the clonogenic and tumorigenic capacities of AR-KO
cells.
In sharp contrast, AR-KO LNCaP clones demonstrate higher
tumor-regenerating capabilities than AR+ cells when implanted
in castrated mice (Supplementary Fig. 8). Remarkably, when 3
clones each of AR+ and AR-KO LNCaP cells are implanted side-
by-side in castrated NSG mice, AR-KO cells develop more and,
frequently, larger tumors than AR+ cells (Fig. 4). These results
corroborate that, as expected, the tumorigenic growth of AR+
PCa cells requires androgen. Importantly, these tumor experi-
ments provide direct evidence that the AR-KO PCa cells possess
intrinsically high tumor-regenerating capabilities in androgen-
ablated hosts. As the AR+ and AR-KO clonal cells are implanted
in the same castrated host, the results (Fig. 4) also provide the
first hint that AR-KO cells possess a competitive advantage over
AR+ tumor cells in regenerating tumors in the absence of
androgen.

 AR-KO LNCaP cells resist Enza in vitro and in vivo. The
preceding comparative tumor studies have exposed striking
intrinsic differences in tumor-regenerating properties in AR-
expressing vs. AR-deficient PCa cells in relation to different
androgen levels. We subsequently investigate the Enza response
in the two cell types. AR-KO LNCaP cells display higher sphere-
formation, clonal, and proliferative capacities than AR+ cells in
Enza-containing media (Supplementary Fig. 9). As expected, AR+
LNCaP cell-derived tumors exhibit exquisite sensitivity to Enza
whereas, in stark contrast, AR-KO cells develop tumors in
castrated mice that are completely refractory to Enza treatment
(Fig. 5). We perform single-cell tracking experiments by time-
lapse videomicroscopy11,14 to further explore cell-intrinsic dif-
ferences between AR+ and AR-KO PCa cells in response to Enza.
The results reveal that AR-KO cells have shorter cell-cycle transit
time, greater proliferative capacity, and lower apoptotic rate than
AR+ LNCaP cells in Enza-containing media (Fig. 6a–d; Supple-
mentary movies 1-4). Quantitative analysis of endpoint clones
that contain 1 cell, 2 cells, or >2 cells (3–6 cells) in each clone
(clones containing >2 cells indicate that the starting single cell has
divided more than once during the recording period) demon-
strates that in DHT media, 23% of the 189 single AR+ LNCaP
cell-derived clones contain >2 cells compared to 11% of the
209 single AR-KO cells tracked (Fig. 6c), suggesting that AR+
LNCaP cells have a tendency to proliferate faster than AR-KO
cells in androgen-stimulated conditions (consistent with earlier
observations; Supplementary Fig. 7c). In contrast, in Enza-
containing media, 28% (67/244) of the single AR-KO cells have
divided more than once compared to 10% (20/201) of the AR+
cells (Fig. 6c; P = 0.05). Importantly, in Enza medium, 53% (107/
201) of single AR+ LNCaP cells stay quiescent with no cell
division (i.e., containing 1 cell in the endpoint clones) compared
to 35% (85/244) of AR-KO cells in the same media (Fig. 6c; P =
0.01). Also, AR+ LNCaP cells show a high propensity to undergo
death at the first cell division in the presence of Enza (Fig. 6d).
These results indicate that AR+ LNCaP cells, at the single-cell
level, are sensitive whereas AR-null cells are intrinsically resistant
to Enza.
Of interest, when we compare the cell division profiles of AR-
KO LNCaP cells in DHT vs. Enza, 28% cells undergo cell-cycle
progression in Enza-containing media, which is significantly
higher than 11% of the AR-KO cells in the presence of DHT
(Fig. 6c; P < 0.01, χ2 test). These results again suggest that
androgens may exert inhibitory effects on AR-KO cells.
Distinct competitive advantages of AR+ vs. AR-KO PCa cells.
Since most patient CRPC specimens contain both AR+ and AR−/lo
PCa cells (Fig. 1 a–c; Supplementary Fig. 1), we wonder whether

 these two PCa cell subpopulations may possess different competi-
tiveness in different androgen/AR signaling environments. We
perform competition experiments to test this possibility by mixing
AR-RFP+ and GFP-labeled AR-KO LNCaP cells (1:1) and the
results reveal a prominent competitive advantage for AR+ LNCaP
cells in DHT and for AR-KO cells in Enza-containing media,
respectively (Fig. 6e–g). Similar results are obtained using in vivo
competition experiments (Supplementary Fig. 10). In intact
(androgen-proficient) male mice the AR-RFP+ tumor cells pre-
dominate but in castrated mice the AR-KO (RFP−) tumor cells
represent the majority in the tumors (Supplementary Fig. 10b).
Notably, when several T-supplemented animals bearing mixed
tumors are removed of T pellets and also castrated at week 4, AR-
RFP+ LNCaP cells are reduced whereas AR-KO cells increased by
week 9 (Supplementary Fig. 10b). These results corroborate
apparent competitive survival and growth advantages of AR-KO
PCa cells in androgen-depleted conditions.
RNA-Seq identifies signaling pathways in AR+/hi LNCaP
CRPC. The above experiments in genetically matched LNCaP
clonal cells have documented the relative proliferative, survival,
and tumorigenic advantages of AR+ vs. AR- PCa cells in
androgen-proficient vs. androgen-ablated conditions, respec-
tively. Although AR+ LNCaP tumors are sensitive to Enza, as
observed in AR+/hi LNCaP 1° CRPC (Fig. 1f) and patient CRPC,
AR-KO LNCaP tumors, much like AR−/lo LAPC9 CRPC (Fig. 1f),
are refractory to Enza. Subsequently, we have made efforts to
understand how AR+/hi LNCaP 1° CRPC becomes Enza-resistant
and why AR−/lo LAPC9 1° CRPC is Enza-resistant de novo.
Enza-resistant LNCaP 2° CRPC continues to express high levels
of AR and also upregulates GR (Supplementary Fig. 11a-b; Sup-
plementary Note 1), which has been implicated in castration
resistance21. RNA-Seq analysis (Fig. 7a; Supplementary Fig. 11c–
f) in LNCaP AD→1° CRPC→2° CRPC models (Fig. 1d) reveals
2,451 differentially expressed genes (DEGs; FC ≥ 2, FDR < 0.05)
in LNCaP 1° CRPC (over AD), 3254 DEGs in 2° CRPC (over
AD), and 601 DEGs in 2° CRPC compared to 1° CRPC (Sup-
plementary Fig. 11f; Supplementary Data 2-4). Overall, there are
more upregulated than downregulated genes in both 1° and 2°
CRPC compared to LNCaP AD tumors (Supplementary Fig. 12a-
b). Examination of 9 genes (AR, NR3C1 [GR], KLK3, FKBP5,

 western blotting analyses (Fig. 2b; Supplementary Fig. 11a),
reveals that AR is upregulated by castration and further upregu-
lated by Enza (Supplementary Fig. 12a, b, d) but PSA and FKBP5
levels decrease in both CRPC (Supplementary Fig. 12d) whereas
NR3C1 is prominently upregulated in LNCaP 2° CRPC (Sup-
plementary Fig. 12a-d). Among the 5 CSC molecules examined,
BCL-2, ITGA2, and MYC show upregulation mainly in 2° CRPC
whereas ALDH7A1 and STAT3 mRNA levels are decreased
(Supplementary Fig. 12e). Notably, NEPC markers including SYP,
CHGA, CHGB, SCG3, and SCN3A are either unaltered or actually
downregulated in LNCaP CRPC.
Bioinformatics analysis of our RNA-Seq data (Supplementary
Figs. 13–14; Supplementary Note 1), including IPA (Ingenuity
Pathway Analysis) and GSEA (Gene Set Enrichment Analysis;
Supplementary Table 3), reveals that both 1° and 2° LNCaP
CRPC are enriched in gene signatures associated with ADT
resistance in patient CRPC22,23 (Fig. 7b; Supplementary Fig. 13a)
and patient CRPC-NE (neuroendocrine-like CRPC) phenotype24
(Fig. 7c). For example, GSEA (note that the FDR in GSEA is the
estimated probability that a gene set with a given “normalized
enrichment score/NES” represents a false positive finding, and an
FDR < 0.25 for GSEA is considered statistically significant) shows
that genes enriched in both 1° and 2° LNCaP CRPC correlate with
the genes upregulated in patient tumors that have failed ADT22
(Fig. 7b), and, with the top 700 genes overexpressed in CRPC-NE
compared to CRPC-Adeno tumors24 (Fig. 7c). Interestingly, both
1° and 2° LNCaP CRPC gene profiles are enriched for interesting
signaling pathways including “Stem Cell Signaling”, “Lipid
Signaling”,
and
“Neurogenesis”
(Fig.
7d,
Supplementary
Fig. 13b–f, Supplementary Fig. 14a-c; Supplementary Note 1).
For example, 1° and 2° LNCaP CRPC DEGs correlate with
neurogenesis gene signatures in PSA−/lo PCa stem cells11

Fig. 6 Unique biological properties and competitive advantages of AR-KO LNCaP cells in Enza-containing media. a Single AR-KO LNCaP cells divide faster
and have shorter cell-cycle transit times than AR+ LNCaP cells in the presence of Enza as determined by time-lapse videomicroscopy. Representative images
of a KO-16 cell (labeled with GFP, upper), which divided several times within 72 h and an AR-30 cell (lower), which did not divide within the same time
interval. Scale bar: 250 μm. Corresponding movies were shown in Supplementary movies 1 and 2. b Graphical presentation of cell-cycle transition times in
AR-KO vs. AR + LNCaP cells based on the time-lapse tracking of the 2 AR+ (AR-30 and AR-31) and 2 AR-KO (KO-03 and KO-16) LNCaP clones. The total
number of cells analyzed and P value (Student’s t-test; mean ± SD) are indicated. Scale bar: 250 μm. c Single AR-KO LNCaP cells undergo more cell divisions
than AR + clonal LNCaP cells in the presence of Enza (2 μM). Single AR+ (AR-30 and AR-31) and AR-KO (KO-03 and KO-16) cells in either DHT-containing
(top) or Enza-containing (bottom) media were put under the JuLi Stage time-lapse videomicroscope and tracked for 4-5 continuous days with images taken
every 2 h. Shown are pie chart presentations of endpoint clones that contained 1 cell, 2 cells, or >2 cells (3–6 cells) in each clone. Clones that contained >2
cells indicate that the starting single cell divided more than once during the recording period. The total number of single cells analyzed is indicated below (n).
See Text for details. d High propensity of AR+ LNCaP cells undergoing death at the first cell division in the presence of Enza. As indicated, ~18% (36/201) of
single AR+ LNCaP cells, compared to 4% (10/244) single AR-KO cells, were dead (P = 0.002, Student’s t-test, mean ± SD) during the first cell division
when cultured in Enza. e, f Competitive advantage of AR+ cells in DHT-containing media and of AR-KO cells in Enza-containing media. RFP+ AR-31 LNCaP
cells were mixed (1:1) with GFP-labeled KO-03 cells and plated in either DHT-containing (a) or Enza-containing (b) media at clonal density on day 0 and
then tracked for 7 days. Shown are representative images. The percentages refer to relative confluence (fluorescence-positive area divided by the total area)
determined by the JuLi Stage fluorescence time-lapse microscope. g Graphical presentation of competitive advantages of AR+ and AR-KO LNCaP cells in

 (Supplementary Fig. 15c, d). The greater upregulation of BCL-2
in 2° LNCaP CRPC suggests that Enza may directly induce BCL-2
expression. Indeed, Enza treatment induces BCL-2 in LNCaP
(Supplementary Fig. 15e), as well as primary patient tumor-
derived PCa (Fig. 7f) cells. BCL-2 overexpression in LNCaP
cells
(Supplementary
Fig.
15f)
enhances
CSC-enriched
holoclone11,14–17 formation in regular (Supplementary Fig. 15g)
and Enza-containing (Fig. 7g) media and also promotes tumor
growth in intact (Fig. 7h; Supplementary Fig. 15h, i) and castrated
(Supplementary Fig. 15j) mice. Consequently, we initiate a ther-
apeutic experiment by treating 1° LNCaP CRPC with the BCL-2
inhibitor ABT-19926, which targets leukemic stem cells and has
been recently FDA-approved (Venetoclax)27, either alone or with
Enza. Remarkably, although ABT-199 alone does not inhibit the
growth of 1° LNCaP CRPC (Supplementary Fig. 15k-l), com-
bining ABT-199 with Enza, but not with GR antagonist RU486,
greatly inhibits the emergence (incidence) of Enza-resistant 2°
LNCaP CRPC (Fig. 7i). These results implicate BCL-2 as a critical
driver and therapeutic target in Enza-resistant AR+/hi CRPC and
suggest
that
ABT-199 needs
to be
used
in
combination
with Enza for the prevention and treatment of Enza-resistant
AR+/hi CRPC.

 Signaling pathways and therapeutic strategies in AR−/lo
LAPC9 CRPC. The AR-/lo LAPC9 CRPC does not respond to
Enza (Fig. 1f). Both CR and Enza-treated LAPC9 tumors express
little AR and PSA but high levels of CSC molecules including N-
cadherin28, c-MYC, integrin α2, and BCL-2 (Fig. 2a; Supple-
mentary Fig. 16a-b). RNA-Seq analysis in LAPC9 AD and CR
tumors (Fig. 8a; Supplementary Fig. 16c-e) reveals 3,929 DEGs
(FDR < 0.05; FC ≥ 2) in CRPC (Supplementary Fig. 17a; Supple-
mentary Data 5). Examination of 4 differentiation-related genes
(AR, NR3C1, KLK3, FKBP5) and 6 CSC genes (ALDH7A1, BCL-2,
CDH2, ITGA2, MYC, and STAT3) in RNA-Seq (Supplementary
Fig. 17b-d), for which we have assessed their protein levels during
LAPC9 AD to CRPC transition (Fig. 2a; Supplementary Fig. 16a),
reveals that, consistent with western blotting, AR and FKBP5 are
much reduced and KLK3 is undetectable whereas NR3C1 is
slightly increased in LAPC9 CRPC (Supplementary Fig. 17c).
Among the 6 CSC molecules, BCL-2, CDH2, ITGA2, and STAT3
show (a trend of) upregulation in CRPC whereas ALDH7A1 is
decreased (Supplementary Fig. 17b,d). Interestingly, although the
c-MYC protein levels are slightly elevated in LAPC9 CRPC
compared to AD tumors (Fig. 2a; Supplementary Fig. 16a; Sup-
plementary Table 3), its mRNA levels are actually reduced

 (Supplementary Fig. 17a, d), suggesting that the increase in c-
MYC protein in LAPC9 CRPC might have resulted from post-
transcriptional mechanisms.
GSEA demonstrates that LAPC9 CR tumors are enriched in
genes associated with ADT resistance and tumor relapse in clinical
CRPC (Fig. 8b). Additional bioinformatic analysis reveals gene
expression patterns and deregulated signaling pathways both
shared with AR+/hi LNCaP CRPC and unique to AR−/lo LAPC9
CRPC (Supplementary Fig. 18, Supplementary Fig. 19a-d). Like AR
+/hi LNCaP CRPC, LAPC9 CRPC is enriched in “Lipid Signaling”
(Phospholipases, Eicosanoid Signaling, FXR/RXR Signaling, etc)
and “Neurogenesis” (e.g., Axonal Guidance Signaling, Serotonin
Degradation) pathways (Fig. 8c; Supplementary Fig. 18a). In
support of a neurogenesis gene expression profile, LAPC9 CRPC-
expressed genes are enriched in ‘Proneural’ subtypes of glioblas-
toma29 (Supplementary Fig. 18b) and in patient CRPC-NE24
showing an increased NE_score (Supplementary Fig. 19a, b). Of
interest, LAPC9 CRPC and the patient CRPC-NE24 share 906
genes (Supplementary Fig. 19c, Supplementary Data 6), which are
also enriched in Lipid Signaling and Neurogenesis pathways
(Supplementary Fig. 19d). On the other hand, despite enrichment
of neurogenesis genes in LAPC9 CRPC, the NEPC markers,
including SYP, CHGA, CHGB, SCG3, and SCN3A, are either
unaltered or actually downregulated in CRPC. Intriguingly, LAPC9
CRPC shows a unique enrichment in “Immune/Inflammation”
related pathways including “Antigen Presentation Pathway”,
“Adaptive Immune Cells”, and, particularly, “Interferon Signaling”
(Fig. 8c; Supplementary Fig. 18a, c).
Consistent with our earlier biochemical characterizations
(Fig. 2a), LAPC9 CRPC also displays prominent alterations in
pathways
that
regulate
stem
cells,
including
“Human
ESC Pluripotency”, “Wnt/β-catenin”, and “STAT3 Signaling”
(Fig. 8c; Supplementary Fig. 18a). Among the top upregulated
stem cell genes in LAPC9 CRPC are BCL-2, CDH2, integrins
including ITGA2, SHH, and WNT genes such as WNT5A
(Fig. 8c, d; Supplementary Fig. 17a, b, d; Supplementary
Fig. 19e). CDH2 (N-cadherin) mRNA (Fig. 8d; Supplementary
Fig. 17a, d) and protein (Fig. 2a; Supplementary Fig. 16a) are
both upregulated in LAPC9 CRPC and a monoclonal antibody
to N-cadherin has been shown to inhibit castration resistance28,
suggesting that the CSC molecules upregulated in AR−/lo CRPC
are causally involved in CRPC emergence and progression. As
LAPC9 CRPC is AR−/lo and does not respond to Enza, we
further explore potential causal functions of 3 upregulated CSC
molecules, i.e., BCL-2, ITGA2 (integrin α2), and c-MYC by
therapeutically targeting them alone or in combination. The
BCL-2 inhibitor ABT-199 alone significantly inhibits LAPC9
CRPC growth (Fig. 8e; Supplementary Fig. 19f, Student’s t-test)
and organoid expansion (Fig. 8f, g). Enza displays little
inhibitory effects, and Enza plus ABT-199 demonstrates similar
inhibitory effects to ABT-199 alone, on LAPC9 CRPC organoid
growth (Fig. 8f, g). On the other hand, ABT-199 in combination
with JQ1, which inhibits the BET bromodomain-containing
proteins including c-MYC30, further inhibits LAPC9 CRPC
growth in castrated mice (Fig. 8e; Supplementary Fig. 19f).
Finally, as we have previously demonstrated the critical
importance of integrin α2 in the tumorigenic growth of LAPC9
and
LAPC4
CRPC
in
vivo16,
we
perform
mono-
and
combinatorial therapies targeting integrin α2β1 using a small
molecule inhibitor (α2β1-i)31. As shown in Fig. 8h–j. α2β1-i
inhibits LAPC9 CRPC growth in castrated mice, which is
potentiated by JQ1.
Collectively, these xenograft-based therapeutic experiments
targeting 3 CSC signaling molecules, i.e., BCL-2, integrin α2β1,
and c-MYC, offer novel proof-of-concept strategies for treating
the AR−/lo LAPC9-type of CRPC cells/clones.
Discussion
Heterogeneity in AR expression levels in PCa has been noted for
decades, from untreated tumors to CRPC to disseminated
metastases2–14. In fact, AR−/lo PCa cells pre-exist in untreated
PCa2,5,8,9,12–14. By performing AR IHC analysis in prostatectomy
specimens, we have observed ~5-20% of AR−/lo PCa cells in a
dozen of untreated Gleason 6-7 tumors with AR+ PCa cells
representing the majority14. Heterogeneity in AR expression in
CRPC tends to become accentuated such that AR+ PCa cells may
evolve into AR+/hi cells and the AR-/lo cell population may
expand2,14, leading to co-evolution of both subpopulation of PCa
cells in the primary (prostate) tumor (Fig. 8k). PCa metastases,
which are generally clonal in origin, may manifest as either AR+
or AR−/lo, as evidenced by commonly used, mostly metastasis-
derived PCa cell lines (e.g., PC3, DU145, and PPC-1 being AR-
whereas LNCaP, LAPC9, VCaP, LAPC4 being AR+), as well as by
recent positron emission tomography/computed tomography-
based AR-axis imaging analysis32,33.
By analyzing 195 TMA cores and 8 whole-mount slides of
CRPC specimens (mostly from the prostates with several
metastases) obtained from 89 patients (most of whom were
treated in the pre-Enza era), we have observed 3 distinct AR
expression patterns, AR+/hi, nuc/cyto-AR, and AR−/lo, which can
all be explained by well-established knowledge of steroid hor-
mone receptor functions. Thus, under persistent selective pres-
sure of castration and antiandrogens, PCa cells may overexpress
(AR+/hi), lose (AR−/lo) or redistribute (cyto-AR) the target pro-
tein, AR, in order to survive. As more specific and potent AR-
targeting therapeutics are being used in the clinic, more AR+
adenocarcinomas are being turned (reprogrammed) to AR−/lo
NE-like
tumors
called
CRPC-NE24,34
or
AR
pathway-
independent AR−NE− tumors called double-negative PCa (or
DNPC35). The emergence and increasing prevalence of AR−/lo
PCa cells/clones beg the important questions of whether they still
respond to further antiandrogen treatments and how they can be
therapeutically targeted.
The present study focuses on addressing the critical question of
whether AR+ and AR−/lo PCa cells possess intrinsically different
biological and tumorigenic properties and how they respond to
androgen-targeting therapeutics. Xenograft modeling of CRPC by
serially propagating 4 AR+ human PCa models in castrated mice
(which mimics first-line castration in patients using GnRH
analogs18,19) reveals strikingly distinct evolutionary trajectories:
the LNCaP model gradually becomes AR+/hi and VCaP and
LAPC4 become nuc/cyto-AR whereas the LAPC9 model evolves
into AR−/lo. Therapeutic experiments demonstrate that the 3 AR-
expressing CRPC models are transiently sensitive to Enza whereas
the AR−/lo LAPC9 CRPC are refractory to Enza treatment de
novo. These results represent among the first prospective experi-
mental evidence linking AR expression status to distinct castra-
tion and Enza responses. Ongoing studies are investigating how
heterogeneity in AR distribution, e.g., largely cytoplasmic AR in
LAPC4 CRPC, impacts tumor response to antiandrogens.
To further investigate intrinsic differences between AR-
expressing and non-expressing PCa cells, we have established
genetically matched AR+ and AR-KO LNCaP cell clones that
allow us to perform side-by-side comparisons of their in vivo
tumorigenic capabilities and relative competitive advantages in
both androgen-intact and androgen-ablated (castration/Enza)
hosts, as well as well-controlled cell biology experiments includ-
ing single cell tracing studies. The results have demonstrated: (1)
AR-KO cells possess intrinsically high tumor- and CRPC-
regenerating activities in castrated mice (Fig. 4; Supplementary
Fig. 8); (2) AR-KO PCa cells are resistant to Enza in vitro
(Supplementary Fig. 9) and in vivo (Fig. 5) whereas AR+ cells are
sensitive to Enza; (3) AR+ PCa cells, as expected, require

 androgen/AR signaling for their clonogenic and tumorigenic
activities (Fig. 3; Supplementary Fig. 9) although some AR+ PCa
cells may escape castration and regenerate tumors in castrated
hosts (Fig. 3b–d; Supplementary Fig. 8); and (4) AR-KO LNCaP
cells display prominent competitive advantages in castrated (or
Enza-treated) conditions/hosts whereas AR+ PCa cells manifest
competitive
advantages
in
androgen-containing
conditions
(Fig. 6; Supplementary Fig. 10). While our manuscript was under
revision, Bluemn et al. show that CRISPR/cas9-derived AR-null
PacMet-UT1 PCa cells are also resistant to castration and Enza35.
Approximately 30% CRPC TMA cores are AR−/lo (Fig. 1b) and
40-50% CRPC cells in whole-mount prostate sections are AR−/lo
(Fig. 1c; Supplementary Fig. 1d), which is substantially higher than
the 5–20% AR−/lo cells in untreated tumors14. Nevertheless, every
treatment-failed prostate tumor harbors both AR−/lo and AR+/hi
cells. This raises the question of why AR−/lo PCa cells do not
become the predominant or even the sole cell subpopulation in
CRPC considering their competitive edges over the AR+ PCa cells.
Plausible explanations may include: (1) incomplete chemical cas-
tration and AR blockage; (2) intracrine androgen production; (3)
and inter-dependent symbiotic relationship between AR+/hi and
AR−/lo cells. On the other hand, it is conceivable that in mCRPC
patients, some metastatic foci may be predominantly AR+/hi while
others primarily AR−/lo (reviewed in 2), as reported recently in
patient metastases32,33,35.
Intriguingly, androgen seems to exert preferential suppressive
effects on AR-deficient PCa cells. The two AR-KO LNCaP clones,
when implanted in intact male mice with or without exogenous
DHT, hardly regenerated any tumors (Fig. 3). Also, AR-KO cells,
at the single-cell level, were less proliferative and formed fewer
spheres and clones in DHT-containing media (Fig. 6c, e; Sup-
plementary Fig. 7a--c). We have also observed that exogenous T
greatly suppressed the growth of AR−/lo LAPC9 CRPC implanted
in castrated mice (Zhao et al., unpublished observations).
Androgen suppression of AR−/lo PCa cells have previously been
reported, for example, in ARCaP cells36, and this effect seems to
be still mediated through AR37. Interestingly, androgens have also
been shown to repress AR+/hi CRPC cells38. We are currently
exploiting our novel AR-KO LNCaP and AR−/lo LAPC9 CRPC
models to elucidate molecular mechanisms underlying androgen
suppression of AR-deficient PCa and to determine whether the
phenomenon of T suppression of AR−/lo CRPC in vivo might also
involve host (e.g., immune, stromal) mechanisms. Also ongoing
are comprehensive RNA-Seq and biological studies that aim to
elucidate the transcriptome differences between AR+ vs. AR−/lo
(and AR-KO) PCa cells and to understand how some AR+ cells
could develop tumors in castrated hosts.
Our studies suggest that AR+ and AR−/lo PCa cell sub-
populations, which co-exist in untreated primary tumors2–14,
may co-evolve under pressure from castration/Enza to generate
AR+/hi (LNCaP-type), as well as AR−/lo (LAPC9-type) CRPC
cells/clones (Fig. 8k). RNA-Seq analyses show that AR+/hi and
AR−/lo CRPC possess both shared and unique gene profiles—
both are enriched in genes that regulate stem cells, neurogen-
esis, and lipid metabolism whereas AR+/hi CRPC shows altered
Steroid Signaling while AR−/lo CRPC is enriched in Immune/
Inflammation gene signatures (Fig. 8k). Although the func-
tional significance of these pathways remains to be fully eluci-
dated, several CSC molecules uncovered herein, highlighted by
BCL-2, appear to be critical regulators and therapeutic targets
of CRPC. Indeed, BCL-2 inhibition combined with Enza dra-
matically inhibits the emergence of Enza-resistant AR+/hi
CRPC whereas BCL-2 inhibition alone retards AR−/lo CRPC.
Although early studies have implicated BCL-2 in CRPC
development39–41, our present study is the first to demonstrate
that: (1) BCL-2, but not BCL-XL nor MCL-1, is exclusively
upregulated in patient CRPC; (2) BCL-2 is directly induced by
Enza treatment; and (3) BCL-2 is upregulated in both Enza-
resistant AR+/hi and Enza-insensitive AR-/lo CRPC. These
observations are consistent with early studies showing AR
repression of BCL-241. Although BCL-2 has been a long-
standing therapeutic target in PCa, early clinical trials using
non-specific and toxic BCL-2 family inhibitors have all failed.
ABT-199
represents
a
third-generation
BCL-2-slective
inhibitor26,42,
has
recently
been
FDA-approved
for
CLL
patients27, and is quickly moving to clinical trials for lymphoma
due to its anti-CSC activities43. Collectively, our CRPC mod-
eling in LNCaP system suggests a proof-of-concept therapeutic
regimen for AR+/hi CRPC clones, i.e., to combine steroid
receptor (AR, GR) targeting therapeutics with inhibitors of
ADT-induced CSC molecules such as BCL-2. Based on this
rationale, we (G.C.; I.P.; D.G.T.) have initiated a phase Ib/II
clinical trial of combining Enza and Venetoclax (i.e., ABT-199)
to treat Enza-naïve metastatic PCa patients aiming to delay/
prevent CRPC. It should be noted that the VCaP CRPC do not
upregulate BCL-2, suggesting that, due to genetic diversity (e.g.,
TMPRSS-ERG fusion), different CRPC clones may employ
different survival strategies to evade ADT.
Xenograft modeling in LAPC9 system has also provided proof-
of-concept therapeutic strategies for AR−/lo CRPC clones. The
LAPC9
CRPC,
which
phenotypically
resembles
AR−NE−
DNPC35, is characterized by prominent upregulation of multiple
stem cell/CSC molecules in addition to BCL-2 (Figs. 2a, 8c, d),
suggesting that such CRPC cells/clones may be sensitive to, and,
should be treated with, combinatorial anti-CSC strategies. In
support, treating AR−/lo LAPC9 CRPC with ABT-199 or ABT-
199 plus JQ1 (a BET inhibitor that also inhibits c-Myc), led to
dramatic inhibition of AI tumor growth (Fig. 8e). Similar CRPC-
suppressive effects are also observed with an inhibitor of integrin
α2β1, either alone or in combination with JQ1 (Fig. 8I, j). Of great
interest, the AR−/lo LAPC9 CRPC is greatly enriched in Immune/
Inflammation gene signatures, in particular, the IFN signatures,
and, the AR− (NE−) patient CRPC are also enriched in IFN-
responsive gene signatures35. These new observations raise the
intriguing possibility that AR-/lo CRPC cells might preferentially
cross talk with the host immune system to escape immune
surveillance.
Most prostate (primary) tumors in CRPC patients contain both
AR+/hi and AR−/lo PCa cells and mCRPC patients harbor AR+/hi
and AR−/lo metastatic clones2,32–34; therefore, curative anti-CRPC
therapeutic strategies entail elimination of both PCa cell popula-
tions. Our observations that both AR+/hi LNCaP and AR−/lo
LAPC9 CRPC are enriched in neurogenesis and lipid signaling
gene signatures open the door for future exploration of novel
regulators and therapeutic targets in CRPC. The availability of our
novel CRPC xenograft and genetically matched AR+/AR-KO
LNCaP clonal models should facilitate future studies on: (1)
dynamic and reciprocal cooperation and interactions between the
two PCa cell subpopulations during ADT and tumor relapse, (2)
the causal functions of and novel signaling pathways in mediating
Enza response by cytoplasmic AR (e.g., LAPC4 1° CRPC), and (3)
PCa cell reprogramming and lineage plasticity accompanying
tumor progression and clinical treatments. These models and tools
should also facilitate unbiased high-throughput small-molecule
and genetic screens to identify novel AR-/lo CRPC cell-targeting
therapeutics.
Methods
Overall study design and rationale. The present study was initiated to address
the critical question of how AR heterogeneity in expression levels impacts PCa
growth and responses to ADT and Enza. We started by performing IHC analysis of
AR, using several titrated anti-AR N-terminal antibodies, in tissue microarray or

 whole-mount sections from a total of 89 CRPC patients. The results revealed 3
patterns of AR expression in patient CRPC: nuc-AR+/hi, nuc/cyto-AR, and AR−/lo
(Fig. 1a–c; Supplementary Fig. 1). Subsequent xenograft modeling and therapeutic
experiments in 4 models indicated that nuc-AR+/hi and nuc/cyto-AR PCa xeno-
grafts initially responded to Enza but this response was transient and Enza-
resistant tumors quickly emerged. In contrast, AR−/lo xenografts were Enza-
resistant de novo (Fig. 1d–f). These results suggest that lack or low levels of AR
expression confers castration/Enza resistance. To further investigate this important
point, we employed two complimentary genome-editing techniques to derive AR-
RFP+ (AR+) and AR-knockout (AR-KO) LNCaP clones, which were then used in a
battery of in vitro biological and in vivo tumorigenic and Enza response assays, and
the results revealed many interesting and surprising differences in the two sub-
populations of PCa cells with different AR expression status (Figs. 3–6; Supple-
mentary Fig. 3-10; Supplementary movies 1-4). We then focused on two xenograft
model systems, i.e., Enza-resistant AR+/hi LNCaP secondary CRPC and Enza-non-
responsive AR−/lo LAPC9 CRPC, performed RNA-Seq and exhaustive bioinfor-
matics analysis, and conducted mechanistic and combinatorial therapeutic
experiments (Figs. 7–8; Supplementary Figs. 11–19). The results revealed many
novel signaling molecules and pathways in the development of two distinct modes
of castration resistance mediated by AR+/hi and AR−/lo PCa cells, respectively.
Importantly, our study establishes proof-of-principle therapeutic regimens that co-
target the AR+/hi and AR−/lo CRPC cells/clones.
Cell lines, animals, and reagents. LNCaP and VCaP cells were purchased from
the American Type Culture Collection (ATCC) and cultured in RPMI (for LNCaP)
or DMEM (for VCaP) plus 10% heat-inactivated fetal bovine serum (FBS)
plus antibiotics. LAPC4 and LAPC9 xenograft lines were initially provided by
Dr. Robert Reiter (UCLA) and have been used extensively in our previous
studies11,14–17. These PCa lines were authenticated regularly in our institutional
CCSG Cell Line Characterization Core and also examined to be free of mycoplasma
contamination. Antibodies used in the current study are summarized in Supple-
mentary Table 1. Immunodeficient mice, NOD/SCID (non-obese diabetic/severe
combined immunodeficiency) and NOD/SCID-IL2Rγ−/− (NSG) were obtained
from the Jackson Laboratory, and the breeding colonies were maintained in
standard conditions in our animal facilities. All animal-related studies in this study
have been approved by our Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee
(IACUC) at the M.D. Anderson Cancer Center (ACUF#00000923-RN00) or the
Roswell Park Comprehensive Cancer Center (animal protocol# 1331 M and 1328
M). Therapeutic reagents used in this study included enzalutamide (also called
MDV3100; APExBio, Cat# A3003 and Selleck Chemicals, Cat# S1250), ABT-199
(APExBio, Cat# A8194), Mifepristone/RU486 (APExBio, Cat# B1511), JQ1
(APExBio, Cat# A1910), docetaxel (APExBio, Cat# A4394), and TC-I 15 or
compound 15 (an α2β1 integrin inhibitor or α2β1-i; Tocris Bioscience, Cat# 4527).
CPRC TMAs and WM CRPC sections. Three TMAs containing 195 patient CRPC
cores were originally derived from 81 CRPC patients (Supplementary Data 1): (1)
UCLA TMA (n = 40 cores with 2 cores per patient, provided by Dr. Jiaoti Huang
now at Duke University) was made from 20 CRPC patients11,14; (2) Cornell TMA
(n = 99 cores with 3 cores per patient, provided by Dr. Mark Rubin and Dr.
Himisha Beltran) was created from 33 CRPC patients; and (3) Roswell Park TMA
(n = 56 cores with 2 cores per patient, provided by Dr. James Mohler) was acquired
from 28 CRPC patients. In addition, WM slides from 8 CRPC patients were
provided by Dr. Jiaoti Huang. Formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded (FFPE) sections
were cut from these TMAs and WM samples and used for immunohistochemistry
(IHC) of AR. Relevant information available on patient samples and treatment was
summarized in Supplementary Data 1. All studies using archived human (tumor)
specimens such as CRPC sections have been approved and followed the ethical
regulations recommended by the Institutional Review Board (IRB
STUDY00000079).
IHC and IF in FFPE sections and western blotting. Basic IHC and IF procedures
in FFPE sections (4 μm) were detailed previously11,14–17. For IHC, slides were
deparaffinized in xylene and hydrated in gradient alcohols to water. Slides were
treated with antigen retrieval in 10 mM citrate buffer (pH 6.0) and incubated with
primary antibodies (Supplementary Table 1; optimal dilutions were determined by
antibody titration experiments in pilot studies) followed by secondary antibodies
and DAPI counterstaining (when applicable). IHC images were captured using an
Olympus inverted (epifluorescence) microscope. The whole-mount and TMA IHC
slides were scanned using Aperio ScanScope imaging system (Aperio Technologies,
Vista, CA, USA) and a ×40 objective. Images were analyzed using the ScanScope
software. For Western blotting analysis, whole cell lysate was prepared in RIPA
buffer and run on 4–15% gradient SDS-PAGE gels. The proteins were transferred
to nitrocellulose membrane followed by incubation with primary antibodies
(Supplementary Table 1) and corresponding secondary antibodies. Films were
developed using Western Lighting ECL Plus reagent (PerkinElmer). Representative
original films for multiple Western blotting analyses were presented in Supple-
mentary Figs. 20–25.
Establishing serially transplantable AD and CR or AI PCa xenografts. Briefly,
AD (i.e., androgen-sensitive) xenograft tumors, LNCaP, VCaP, LAPC4, and
LAPC9, were routinely maintained in intact immunodeficient NOD/SCID or NSG
mice11,14–17. To establish the CR lines, parental AD tumor cells were purified,
mixed with Matrigel, injected subcutaneously and serially passaged in surgically
castrated immunodeficient mice. The LAPC4 and LAPC9 AD and CR xenograft
lines were maintained and passaged in NOD/SCID mice, whereas LNCaP and
VCaP AD and CR xenograft lines were passaged in NSG mice. Xenograft tumors
that became CR were termed primary (1°) CRPC and CR tumors that became
Enza-resistant were termed secondary (2°) CRPC (Fig. 1d).
Purification of human PCa cells from xenograft tumors. Basic xenograft tumor
processing was described previously11,14–17. In brief, xenograft tumors were har-
vested, chopped into pieces (~1 mm3), and digested with Accutase (Sigma, A6964)
for 30 min at room temperature (RT) under constant rotations. Single cells were
collected via a pre-wetted 40-μm strainer and further purified on Histopaque-1077
(Sigma) gradient to deplete debris and dead cells.
Primary human PCa (HPCa) sample processing. All primary HPCa samples
were obtained with written informed patient consent in accordance with federal
and institutional guidelines, which was approved by M.D. Anderson Cancer Center
Institutional Review Board (IRB) (Protocol number LAB04-0498) and the Roswell
Park Comprehensive Cancer Center IRB (BDR073416). Three HPCa samples were
utilized in this study: HPCa229 (71 years old, Gleason grade 3 + 4 = 7, 30% tumor
involvement), HPCa231 (72 years old, Gleason grade 4 + 4 = 8, 100% tumor
involvement), and HPCa232 (72 years old, Gleason grade 4 + 3 = 7, 100% tumor
involvement). Basic procedures for patient HPCa sample processing have been
described previously11,14. Single HPCa epithelial cells were purified into Trop2
+CD45− cell population using flow cytometry (FACS), cultured in PureCol bovine
collagen solution (Advanced BioMatrix) coated dishes16 in modified WIT med-
ium25, and treated with DMSO (vehicle control) or Enza (10 or 20 μM).
RNA isolation and qRT-PCR analysis. Total RNA was extracted using RNeasy
Mini Kit (Qiagen) according to the manufacturer’s instructions. qRT-PCR was
performed using a CFX Connect Real-Time PCR Detection System (Bio-Rad).
qPCR data were normalized to 18 S RNA. Primers utilized were: 18 S, FWD: 5′-
AAGTCCCTGCCCTTTGTACACA-3′ REV: 5′-GATCCGAGGGCCTCACTAA
AC-3′; AR, FWD: 5′-TAGGGCTGGGAAGGGTCTAC-3′ REV: 5′-
GGGAGGTGCTGCGCTC-3′; and PSA, FWD: 5′-GATGAAACAGGCTGT
GCCG-3′ REV: 5′-CCTCACAGCTACCCACTGCA-3′.
Generating AR-tagging LNCaP cell clones. The general scheme for generating
AR-tagging LNCaP cell clones was presented in Supplementary Fig. 3a. The zinc
finger nuclease (ZFN) pair (5′-ACCTGCTAATTAATCAAGTCACnnATGGT-
GAGCGTGGACTTTCCG-3′; Supplementary Fig. 3b) was designed and synthe-
sized by Sigma (St. Louis, MO). Donor vector was synthesized by GeneScript
(Piscataway, NJ), which contained the sequences of furin binding (cleavage) pep-
tide, spacer, P2A peptide and tagRFP cDNA (Supplementary Fig. 3b; also see
Supplementary Note 1). This backbone was flanked with 800 bp homologous arms,
which are the sequences immediately upstream and downstream the AR stop
codon (Supplementary Fig. 3b). To generate AR+ clones, 1 million LNCaP cells
were transfected with 10 μg ZFN pair plasmid and 5 μg donor plasmid with
Lipofectamine 2000. We used donor plasmid-only transfection as negative control.
Three days after transfection, LNCaP single cell suspension was analyzed and
sorted for tagRFP+ cells with BD FACSAria™ Fusion cell sorter. tagRFP+ cells were
counted with hemocytometer after sorting and seeded into 96-well plates at one
cell/well. Single cell-derived clones were propagated up in the conditioned medium
prepared from regular LNCaP cell cultures containing 7% FBS, and collected after
four weeks for genotyping. Genomic DNA of the clonal cells was prepared using
the Qiagen Genomic DNA Extraction kit. Genotyping was determined using pri-
mers: P1 flanking the ZFN cutting site (FWD: 5′-GAAGGGGGAGGAAACAAA
AG-3′, REV: 5’-TAGAGGAAATTCCCC AAGGC-3′) and P2 (designed inside the
transgene tagRFP; FWD: 5′-ACTTCAAGTGCACATCCGAGG-3′, REV: 5′-
AGTTTGCTAGGGAGGTCGC-3′) (Supplementary Fig. 3c). The upper band
amplified with the P1 primers was purified from agarose gel and sequenced and the
sequence data were blasted with Seqman Pro. Cell images were captured by an
Olympus inverted epifluorescence microscope. The stable AR-RFP+ LNCaP clones
were designated as AR-FRP+ cells.
Generating AR-KO LNCaP cell clones. The general scheme for generating AR-
KO LNCaP cell clones was presented in Supplementary Fig. 5a. Two guide RNAs
(gRNAs) were designed targeting AR exon 1 (gRNA1 and gRNA2; Supplementary
Fig. 5b) using the following website: http://crispr.mit.edu. The two gRNAs scored
59 and 97, respectively. We cloned the gRNAs into the CRISPR nuclease vector
(ThermoFisher, A21174), and the reporter gene in the vector, OFP (orange
fluorescence protein) immediately after the cas9 nuclease was used to screen for the
transfected cells via FACS. Four microgram of total gRNA1 and gRNA2 vectors
were transfected into 500,000 LNCaP cells with Lipofectamine 2000. Three days
after transfection, LNCaP single cell suspension was analyzed and sorted for OFP+

 cells with BD FACSAria™ Fusion cell sorter. OFP+ cells were counted with
hemocytometer after sorting and seeded into 96-well plates at one cell/well. Clonal
cells were collected after four weeks and genotyped using primers: ARN FWD: 5′-
GAGACAGACTGTGAGCCTAGC-3′ and ARN REV: 5′-GCTGTGAAGGTTG
CTGTTCC-3′. Sequence data were analyzed with Seqman Pro. The resultant
LNCaP clones with AR knocked out were called AR-KO clones.
Luciferase assays in AR+ and AR-KO cells. LNCaP clonal cells were seeded in
24-well plates (3 × 104 cells/well) and were co-transfected with 1 μg ARE (andro-
gen-responsive element) or PSA reporters together with the Renilla luciferase
internal normalization plasmid (phRL-CMV). As a control, one group was treated
with 10 nM DHT (dihydrotestosterone) 12 h before measuring luciferase activities.
The ratio of firefly to Renilla luciferase activity was determined with a dual luci-
ferase assay (Promega) 48 h later. Unpaired two-tailed Studentʼs t-test was used to
compare differences between groups, and P < 0.05 was considered statistically
significant.
Clonal and clonogenic (sphere formation) assays in AR+ and AR-KO cells. For
in vitro clonal assays, 5000 AR-KO or AR+ LNCaP cells were plated in 6-well
plates, and 2 weeks later, cells were stained with 1:20 Giemsa and images scanned
with an HP scanner. The number of clones was quantified with ImageJ. For clo-
nogenic assays, 500 AR-KO or AR+ cells were suspended in 100 μL 50% Matrigel
and 50% normal media containing 0.1 nM DHT or 2 μM Enza. The single cell
suspension was spread on the edge of wells in a 24-well plate. 2 weeks later, images
were taken with an Olympus inverted epifluorescence microscope and sphere
numbers were counted.
BrdU incorporation assays in AR+ and AR-KO cells. Cells at 50% confluence
were incubated with 2 μM 5-Bromo-2’-deoxyuridine (BrdU) for 5 h. Cells were
fixed with 4% PFA for 5 min and permeabilized with 1% Triton-X100. DNA was
denatured using 3 M hydrochloric acid in 1% Triton-X100 for 20 min and then
treated with 0.1 M sodium borate for 15 min. Slides were blocked with background
sniper (Biocare Medical, Concord, CA, BS996) for 20 min and incubated with
mouse monoclonal BrdU specific antibody (Sigma, MO, #B2531) for 5 h at room
temperature, followed by incubation with goat anti-mouse IgG conjugated to
Alexafluor 488 and counterstaining with DAPI.
Tumor regeneration and therapeutic experiments in AR+ and AR-KO LNCaP
clones. In general, 200,000 AR-KO and AR+ LNCaP cells were suspended in
Matrigel (50:50 in normal media) and injected subcutaneously into castrated or T
(testosterone)-implanted NSG male mice (8–10 weeks old). Tumor growth was
measured twice weekly in two dimensions using a digital caliper. Tumor volume
was calculated using 1/2 (length × width2). Animal body weight and health status
were monitored during the experiments. At the end of experiments, tumors were
harvested, and tumor incidence, weight, and gross images were recorded. For Enza
therapeutic experiments (Fig. 5), 200,000 AR-KO cells were injected sub-
cutaneously into castrated NSG male mice (~6 weeks old). At ~1 month later when
tumors became palpable, mice were randomly divided into two groups: vehicle
control (n = 14) and Enza (30 mg/kg/week, n = 13). In the mean time, 200,000 AR
+ cells were injected subcutaneously into intact NSG male mice (~6 weeks old),
which were castrated 1 week prior to initiation of Enza treatment at day 30, when
animals were randomized into vehicle control (n = 8) and Enza (30 mg/kg/week
and 3 times/week, n = 7) groups. Enza was dissolved in DMSO as 90 mg/ml stock
solution, which was diluted in corn oil (Sigma) to make 2.5 mg/ml working
solution. Mice were given 100 μL i.p. (intraperitoneal) injections 3 times a week.
Time lapse videomicroscopy studies in AR+ and AR-KO LNCaP cells. LNCaP
AR-KO and AR+ clonal cells were placed on the incubator stage of a JuLI™ Stage
Real-Time microscope system, and maintained at 37 °C, 5% CO2 and >95%
humidity in RPMI medium supplemented with 10% FBS, 1% Pen/Strep, and Enza
(2 μM) or DHT (0.1 nM). Phase, RFP and GFP images were collected continuously
with a ×20 objective lens at 2-h intervals for 96 h. Data analysis was performed
using JuLI™ Stage Software.
In vitro and in vivo competition assays in AR-KO and AR+ cells. For in vitro
competition assays, AR-KO cells were infected with pGIPZ non-silencing GFP
control lentivirus at an MOI of 10 to mark the cells with GFP. For in vitro com-
petition assays, 5000 of AR-KO (GFP+) or AR+ (RFP+) cells were plated into one
well in 6-well plates. Cell images were captured with JuLI™ Stage Real-Time
microscope at 2-h intervals. Three points of each group were recorded and cell
confluence data was measured using ImageJ by analyzing the proportion of
fluorescence positive area of the cell images. For in vivo competition assays,
200,000 each of AR-KO and AR+ cells mixed together were injected sub-
cutaneously into castrated or T-supplemented male mice. Once palpable, tumors
were harvested at different time points and analyzed using a BD LSR II flow
cytometer. A minimum of 10,000 cells were analyzed for each time point.
RNA-Sequencing (RNA-Seq) and bioinformatic analysis. Basic procedures have
been previously described17,25,44. In brief, LNCaP (AD, primary AI, secondary AI)
and/or LAPC9 (AD and AI) tumors were harvested and total RNA was extracted
by RNeasy mini kit (Qiagen), which includes on-column DNA digestion to deplete
genomic DNA. 1000 ng of RNA was used to synthesize cDNA libraries using the
Illumina TruSeq Stranded Total RNA LT Sample Prep kit according to the man-
ufacturer’s guidelines. The libraries were then sequenced via 75 nucleotide paired-
end running on HiSeq 2000 instrument (Illumina, San Diego, CA). 4 (for LNCaP)
or 5 (for LAPC9) biological replicates were prepared for each condition. The reads
were mapped to the reference human genome sequence (hg38) using TopHat
version 2.0.10 (ref.45) and Bowtie version 2.1.0 (ref.46) with parameters “-r 50
--mate-std-dev 50 --library-type fr-unstranded –G”. More than 80% fragments
were mapped to human genome. The number of fragments in each known gene
from GENCODE Release 21 (ref.47) was enumerated using htseq-count from
HTSeq package (version 0.6.1) (ref.48) with parameters “-f bam -m union -s
reverse”. Genes with fewer than 10 fragments in all the samples were removed
before differential expression analysis. There were a total of 60,119 genes, and after
the removal of genes with low number of fragments, there remained 23,933 genes
for LNCaP and 20,842 genes for LAPC9 models. DEseq (version 1.14.0) (ref.49) was
used to call differentially expressed genes (DEGs) in our samples.
To define DEGs, we set up a stringent statistic cutoff of fold change (FC) of ≥2
and the false discovery rate (FDR) <0.05. A total of 2451 DEGs was identified
between LNCaP AD and 1° CRPC and 3254 DEGs between LNCaP AD and
LNCaP 2° CRPC. Also, 601 DEGs were identified between 2° CRPC vs. 1° CRPC
using the criteria of FC ≥ 1.5 and FDR < 0.05, which were specific for Enza
resistance. In LAPC9, 3929 DEGs were identified between AD tumors and CRPC.
The Venn diagram was generated at http://bioinfogp.cnb.csic.es/tools/venny/ using
lists of DEGs from two differential expression comparisons. Heatmaps were plotted
by the free downloaded software of Cluster 3.0 and Java Tree View. To generate the
landscape profile of RNA-Seq, for the fragments that have both ends mapped, the
first reads were kept. Together with the reads from the fragments that have only
one end mapped, every read was extended to its 3′ end by 200 bp in exon regions.
For each read, a weight of 1/n was assigned, where n is the number of positions the
read was mapped to. The sum of weights for all the reads that cover each genomic
position was rescaled to normalize the total number of fragments to 1 M and
averaged over 10 bp resolution. The normalized values were displayed using UCSC
genome browser (http://genome.ucsc.edu/).
IPA, GSEA, and determination of NE_scores. Ingenuity Pathway Analysis (IPA;
Qiagen) was used to analyze pathways that are preferentially enriched in our
LNCaP and LAPC9 CRPC models compared to the corresponding AD tumors
using an IPA software downloaded from www.ingenuity.com. Basic procedures
have been described in our earlier report25. In brief, we uploaded our DEG lists
with FC ≥ 2 and FDR < 0.05 into the IPA software, and ran the Core Analysis to
find the enriched signaling pathways. The FC and FDR were estimated by DESeq.
IPA used Fisher’s exact test to determine if the genes in each pathway significantly
overlap our DEG lists.
We performed GSEA (Gene Set Enrichment Analysis)50 to correlate our LNCaP
and LAPC9 CRPC models (vs. AD tumors) to known gene expression signatures.
The normalized count table estimated by DESeq for all genes (i.e., unselected) was
taken as the input for GSEA and the genes were ranked in GSEA by the Signal/
Noise metric. The sample permutation was performed by 1000 times to assess the
statistical significance. We followed the GSEA user’s guide (http://www.
broadinstitute.org/gsea/doc/GSEA UserGuideFrame.html) using default
parameters to run the software. The FDR in GSEA is the estimated probability that
a gene set with a given “normalized enrichment score/NES” represents a false
positive finding, and an FDR < 0.25 for GSEA is considered statistically significant.
For GSEA, our genes (all genes in LNCaP primary or secondary CRPC vs. AD or
LAPC9 CRPC vs. AD) are used as the ranked gene list (all the genes ranked from
most upregulated to downregulated) to interrogate GSEA database.
The gene expression-profiling data sets employed to perform GSEA of our
RNA-Seq were summarized in Supplementary Table 3, and included: (1) an RNA-
Seq data set comparing the transcriptomes of PCa patient tumors before vs. after
ADT22 (Figs. 7b, 8b); (2) a microarray data set comparing the gene expression
profiles of ‘androgen-independent/AI’ patient tumors vs. untreated ‘AD’ patient
tumors23 (Supplementary Fig. 13a; note that we used the top 1000 upregulated
genes (AI vs. AD) from this microarray data set51); (3) an RNA-Seq analysis
comparing AD LNCaP vs. androgen-independent LNCaP-AI cells52
(Supplementary Fig. 13a); (4) a microarray analysis comparing the gene expression
profiles of recurrent (Rec) vs. non-recurrent (non-Rec) PCa53 (Fig. 8b; note that we
used the top 1000 upregulated genes (Rec vs. non-Rec) from this microarray data
set51); (5) an in-house RNA-Seq data set comparing the PSA−/lo vs. PSA+ LNCaP
cells (Supplementary Fig. 14a; Liu, X. et al., manuscript in preparation); (6) an
RNA-Seq data set in human benign prostate basal/stem cells vs. luminal cells25
(Supplementary Fig. 14b; Supplementary Fig. 18c); (7) an RNA-Seq profiling data
set in neuroendocrine prostate cancer (CRPC-NE) vs. CRPC adenocarcinoma
(CRPC-Adeno)24 (Fig. 7c; Supplementary Fig. 19a); (8) a microarray data set of
genes that are upregulated in the neural crest stem cells54 (Supplementary Fig. 13f);
and (9) a microarray data set presenting genes preferentially expressed in the

 proneural subtype of glioblastoma mutiforme29 (Supplementary Fig. 13f;
Supplementary Fig. 18d).
In addition, we used curated gene set C2 of the Molecular Signature Database
(MSigDB) version 6.0 to determine correlations between our gene set and gene sets
in the MSigDB. Representative data sets presented were also summarized in
Supplementary Table 3. For example, Vanasee et al.55 identified gene signatures
upregulated in primary B lymphocytes isolated from transgenic mice
overexpressing Bcl-2 (Fig. 7e). Boquest et al.56 performed microarray analysis and
uncovered genes upregulated in stromal stem cells (CD31+) vs. non-stem cells
(CD31−) from adipose tissue (Supplementary Fig. 14e). In another study, Lim
et al.57 compared gene expression changes of 4 normal subpopulations of
mammary epithelial cells isolated from mouse mammary gland (stem cell,
committed luminal progenitor, mature luminal, and stromal cells) with their
human counterparts, and showed genes upregulated in the stem cell subpopulation
(Supplementary Fig. 14e). Ben-Porath et al.58 analyzed the gene enrichment
patterns related to embryonic stem cells from different human tumor types, and
found that the Polycomb-regulated genes were preferentially repressed in poorly
differentiated tumors (Supplementary Fig. 14f). Through a Hu6800 GENECHIP
array in HT1080 cells after treatment with interferon (IFN)-α, IFN-β, or IFN-γ,
Der et al.59 identified genes upregulated upon INF-α, IFN-β, or IFN-γ stimulation
(Supplementary Fig. 18b).
An NE_score was developed using two different methods to determine the
similarities in gene expression profiles between adenocarcinomas and NEPC24,60.
The first method24 is based on a list of 70 genes and the score was the Pearson
correlation coefficient of normalized FPKM values of each sample with the mean
value of the NEPC samples in the paper. The score is called integrated NEPC score.
The second method60 is based on a smaller list of 50 genes and the NE_score was
the weighted sum of the FPKM value of those 50 genes. The raw data were obtained
from Beltran et al.24. We determined the relative NE_scores in the LNCaP and
LAPC9 CRPC vs. AD using the second method by Lee et al.60. Briefly, the list of 50
genes was selected to best distinguish NEPC and ADPC samples from Beltran
et al24 using a logistic regression model and elastic net regularization. The weighted
sum of the 50 genes was treated as NE_score and results were presented as relative
NE_scores in AD tumors vs. CRPC (Supplementary Fig. 14c and 19b).
Therapeutic experiments in CR xenografts. NOD/SCID or NSG male mice
(8–10 weeks old) were castrated on day 0. After 7–10 days, 100,000–500,000 CRPC
cells in different models were injected subcutaneously in Matrigel. For Enza
treatment (Fig. 1f), once tumors were palpable, castrated mice were randomly
divided into two groups (vehicle control, n = 10; Enza, 30 mg/kg, n = 10) and
drugs were administered intraperitoneally 3 times a week till the end. For targeted
therapeutic experiments in AR+/hi LNCaP-type of CRPC (Fig. 7i), drugs were
delivered as follows: (1) Enza (n = 12, 30 mg/kg); (2) Enza (30 mg/kg) + RU486/
Mifepristone (20 mg/kg, i.p. 5 times per week61) (n = 12); (3) Enza (30 mg/kg) +
ABT-199 (50 mg/kg, oral gavage, 5 times per week26) (n = 12); (4) Combo: Enza
(30 mg/kg) + RU486 (20 mg/kg) + ABT-199 (50 mg/kg) (n = 12). For experiments
in AR-/loLAPC9-type of CRPC (Fig. 8e–j; Supplementary Fig. 19f), drugs were
delivered as follows: (1) vehicle control (n = 12); (2) JQ1 (50 mg/kg, i.p, 5 times per
week)30 (n = 10); (3) α2β1 inhibitor (i.e., α2β1-i)/compound 15 (20 mg/kg, i.p, 4
times per week31,62) (n = 12); (4) Combo: JQ1 (50 mg/kg) + α2β1-i (20 mg/kg)
(n = 12). For additional experiments in AR-/lo LAPC9 CRPC, once tumors grew
up, castrated mice were randomly divided and drugs were delivered as follows: (1)
vehicle control (n = 12); (2) ABT-199 (50 mg/kg) (n = 12); (3) Combo: JQ1 (50
mg/kg) + ABT-199 (50 mg/kg) (n = 12). ABT-199 (5 mg/ml) was dissolved in
ethanol, and prepared in Phosal-50 PG (Lipoid): polyethylene glycol-400 (Spec-
trum): ethanol (6:3:1)26, whereas other drugs were dissolved in 3–5% DMSO or
ethanol and prepared in corn oil (Sigma). In another experiment, castrated NSG
males bearing LNCaP 1° CRPC were treated with ABT-199 (100 mg/kg, oral
gavage, 5×/week) or vehicle (5% DMSO, 50% PEG30, and 5% Tween 80). Tumor
growth was measured weekly in two dimensions using a caliper and tumor volumes
were determined using 1/2 (length × width2). Animal body weights and health
status were monitored. At the end, tumors were harvested, and tumor incidence,
weight, and gross images were recorded.
BCL-2 related experiments. To overexpress BCL-2 in LNCaP cells, we first pro-
duced the Precision LentiORF BCL-2 lentivirus in 293 T packaging cells (ATCC),
which was titered using GFP positivity in HT1080 cells. LNCaP cells were infected
at MOI 10–15 for 72 h at 37 °C. Precision LentiORF Bcl-2 lentiviral vectors (Clone
ID: PLOHS_100004100) and the control vector (Precision LentiORF RFP positive
control) were purchased from GE Dharmacon. The overexpression effect was
assessed using Western blotting and GAPDH was used as a loading control. For
clonal assays, BCL-2 overexpressing LNCaP cells were plated at a clonal density
(5,000 cells/well in a 6-well dish) under both regular serum-containing (RPMI-
1640 medium + 10% FBS + 1% penicillin/streptomycin) and AR-inhibited (RPMI-
1640 medium + 10% FBS + 1% penicillin/streptomycin + 10 μM Enza) conditions.
Holoclones11,14 were counted and imaged 2 weeks after plating. For tumor assays,
control and BCL-2 overexpressing LNCaP cells were mixed with Matrigel and
injected s.c. at 100,000 cells/injection in intact NSG mice (8–10 weeks). Tumor
volume was measured at weekly basis and the median tumor volume was shown in
Fig. 7h. Tumor incidence was monitored weekly. At the endpoint, tumors were
harvested, and tumor weight and incidence were summarized. To examine if BCL-2
can promote tumorigenicity in castrated hosts, tumor cells were obtained from AD
tumors and injected into castrated NSG mice at 20,000 cells/injection.
‘Therapeutic’ experiments in LAPC9 CRPC organoids. LAPC9 CRPC (AI)
xenografts were digested to single cells using Accumax11,14–17 and single cells were
obtained using a 40-μm cell strainer and purified using Histopaque-1077 (Sigma,
10771). Cells were plated at a density of 25,000 cells/cm2 in a 384 well plate. Cells
were plated in 5% Matrigel diluted with organoid media63 without androgens.
Three days after plating, organoids were treated with various doses of Enza, ABT-
199, or an equimolar combination of the 2 drugs in a constant-ratio combination.
Cell viability was analyzed 6 days post treatment using CellTiter-Blue Cell Viability
Assay (Promega).
Statistical analysis. Unpaired two-tailed Student’s t-test was used to compare
significance in tumor weight and tumor volume, and χ2 test was employed to
compare tumor incidence. The results were presented as mean ± S.D. P < 0.05 was
considered statistically significant.
