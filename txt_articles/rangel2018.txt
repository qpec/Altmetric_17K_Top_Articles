IMPORTANCE Previous work shows women who have children during surgical residency face
difficulty balancing childbearing with training, which negatively affects residency and career
satisfaction. Little is known about the factors that drive professional discontent.
OBJECTIVE To determine factors associated with professional dissatisfaction for childbearing
residents.
DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS Self-administered survey questionnaire electronically
distributed through the Association of Program Directors in Surgery, the Association of
Women Surgeons, and targeted Twitter and Facebook platforms. The survey was distributed
in January 2017 to surgeons who delivered at least 1 child during a US general surgery
residency and was available online for 4 weeks.
MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES Respondents were reported to be dissatisfied with their
residency if they indicated agreement that they considered leaving residency owing to
challenges surrounding childbearing (considered leaving). Respondents were reported to be
unhappy with their career if they indicated agreement with statements that (1) given an
opportunity to revisit their job choice, they would choose a nonsurgical career more
accommodating of motherhood (revisit career choice) or (2) they would advise a female
medical student against a surgical career owing to difficulties balancing motherhood with the
profession (advise against surgery). Logistic regression was used to determine predictors of
agreement with each of the 3 statements of professional dissatisfaction.
RESULTS In total, 347 women responded to the survey and reported 452 pregnancies, and
the mean (SD) age was 30.5 (2.7) years. One hundred seventy-nine respondents (51.6%)
agreed with at least 1 statement of residency or career dissatisfaction. Lack of a formal
maternity leave policy was associated with “considered leaving” (odds ratio [OR], 1.83;
95% CI, 1.07-3.10). Perception of stigma during pregnancy was associated with “revisit career
choice” (OR, 1.79; 95% CI, 1.01-3.19). Changing fellowship plans owing to perceived difficulty
balancing motherhood with the originally chosen subspecialty was associated with all 3
markers of residency and career dissatisfaction (“considered leaving” OR, 2.68; 95% CI,
1.30-5.56; “revisit career choice” OR, 2.23; 95% CI, 1.13-4.43; and “advise against surgery”
OR, 2.44; 95% CI, 1.23-4.84).
CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE Surgery residents who perceived stigma during pregnancy,
did not have a formal institutional maternity leave policy, or altered their fellowship training
plans because of challenges of childbearing expressed greater professional dissatisfaction.
Mentorship in subspecialty selection and work-life integration, interventions to reduce
workplace bias, and identification of obstacles to establishment of maternity leave policies
are needed to enhance professional fulfillment for childbearing residents.

 T
he number of women in medical school is increasing,
now composing half of US graduates in 2018.1 Despite
reduction in sex disparity among trained physicians,
women represent just one-third of applicants to general sur-
gery residencies.2 Perception of a stressful career causing con-
flict between professional and family responsibilities has been
cited as a factor dissuading students from pursuing training
in surgery.3-5 After entering surgical residencies, women have
higher rates of attrition than men (25% vs 15%),6-8 with un-
controllable lifestyle being a commonly reported reason for
leaving the profession.6 Studies investigating the effect of oc-
cupational demands on a female surgeon’
s ability to bear chil-
dren describe reproductive challenges such as infertility, need
for assisted reproductive technology, and increased rates of
perinatal complications.9,10 However, studies capturing the
views of women surgeons who begin families during training
have been limited.
We previously published results of a national survey of
women surgeons who had at least 1 child during residency, de-
scribing their perspectives and the potential effect on train-
ing. This study reported responses on 5 broad themes pertain-
ing to workplace culture during pregnancy, maternity leave
policies,lactationsupport,childcareassistance,andcareerand
residency satisfaction following childbirth.11 More than one-
third of respondents reported seriously considering leaving
residency owing to the challenges of balancing residency with
pregnancy and motherhood.
This study builds on the results of the prior publication by
exploring important remaining questions with regards to the
cultural and structural factors within residency that influ-
ence professional satisfaction. Discontent among childbear-
ing residents reflects a conundrum in the current training para-
digm that may contribute to the surgical sex gap and workforce
shortage. To better answer these highly complex issues and
inform future policy changes to support childbearing resi-
dents, we a priori planned an in-depth analysis of factors
associated with residency and career dissatisfaction. We
present the findings of this analysis to help surgical leaders
identify effective policy improvements to mitigate risk of pro-
fessional dissatisfaction in our future surgical workforce.
Methods
We analyzed data from a 2017 national survey of women who
were pregnant and delivered at least 1 child during surgical
training. Questions were structured as statements to which re-
spondents indicated their agreement on a 4-point Likert scale,
from strongly agree, agree, disagree, to strongly disagree.
Responses were dichotomized, with those categorized as
“agree” representing the sum of agree and strongly agree and
“disagree” representing the sum of disagree and strongly dis-
agree.Demographicandprograminformation,numberofpreg-
nancies and stage of training during pregnancy, and past or an-
ticipated graduation date were collected. Development and
findings of this survey were previously reported, and the sur-
vey is available online.11 A link to the survey was electroni-
cally distributed to active members of the Association of
Women Surgeons, to members of the Association of Program
Directors in Surgery listserv, and through Twitter and Face-
book. Program directors were asked to forward the survey to
current and past women trainees. Two large private Face-
book groups were used, including the Physician Moms Group
(67 156 participants) and the Surgeon Moms Group (960 par-
ticipants), both of whose membership is by invitation of an-
otherphysicianorsurgeon.ThesurveywasdistributedinJanu-
ary 2017 and was available online for 4 weeks. Responses were
anonymous, and participants were not remunerated. Comple-
tion of the survey inferred consent. This study was approved
by the Association of Program Directors in Surgery Commit-
tee on Research, and the Partners Human Research Commit-
tee institutional review board granted exemption.
Study Participants
Responses from women who were pregnant and delivered 1
or more children during an Accreditation Council for Gradu-
ate Medical Education–accredited United States general sur-
gery training program, and who completed residency in 2007
or later, were examined. Responses of those who had a child
during training but did not complete surgical residency were
included if the respondent’
s year of graduation was expected
to be 2007 or later.
Independent Variables and Outcomes
Respondents were queried about cultural and structural char-
acteristics of their training program including perceptions on
working while pregnant, maternity leave policies, breastfeed-
ing and lactation, childcare and motherhood, the presence of
stigma, and satisfaction with residency program and col-
league support. Data were collected on postgraduate subspe-
cialty training plans before and after pregnancy. Respon-
dents who altered their fellowship training plans after
pregnancy and agreed with the statement, “I changed my sur-
gical subspecialty due to difficulty balancing pregnancy/
motherhood with the demands of my original choice of sub-
specialty,” were included in further analysis.
Key Points
Question What are the cultural and structural factors of surgical
training associated with residency and career dissatisfaction in
residents who become pregnant and have children during
training?
Findings In this nationwide survey of childbearing general surgery
residents, 3 risk factors were associated with professional
dissatisfaction: altering fellowship training plans owing to difficulty
balancing childbearing with the original choice of subspecialty;
lack of formal maternity leave policies; and perception of stigma
associated with pregnancy.
Meaning To improve professional fulfillment and reduce risk of
attrition in residents who undergo childbearing during residency,
training programs must implement formal maternity leave policies,
reduce pregnancy-related stigma, and foster mentor-mentee
relationships supporting work-life integration and fellowship
selection.

 Outcome variables included 3 statements that were de-
veloped to assess professional satisfaction. These were modi-
fied from similar measures used to evaluate job satisfaction
incomprehensivenationalsurveysofpracticingsurgeons,phy-
sicians, and surgical residents.8,12-15 Simple or general ques-
tions about professional fulfillment have been found to be in-
sufficient to assess the multiple variables contributing to
physicians’occupational happiness,14 suggesting a multi-
modal approach improves understanding. Because resi-
dency takes place during a finite period, professional satisfac-
tion was differentiated into categories of residency satisfaction
and overall contentment with the surgical career. Partici-
pants were reported to be unhappy with their residency if they
indicated agreement with the statement, “my experience of
pregnancy/motherhoodduringresidencymademestronglyre-
consider whether I wanted to stay in surgery” (“considered
leaving”).Respondentswerereportedtobeunhappywiththeir
career if they indicated agreement with the statements: (1) “if
I could choose again, I would choose a career more accommo-
dating of parenthood than surgery” (“revisit career choice”);
or (2) “if a female medical student came to me for advice, I
would caution her against choosing surgery because of the dif-
ficulty of balancing a surgical career with motherhood” (“ad-
vise against surgery”).
Statistical Analysis
Multivariate logistic regression was used to determine inde-
pendent factors associated with agreement with each of the 3
statements on professional dissatisfaction. Covariates with a
P value of .20 or less on univariate analysis were included in
the multivariate models. Multicollinearity was assessed using
the variance inflation factor. A P value of .05 or less was ac-
cepted as statistically significant, and P values were 2-sided.
Data were analyzed using Stata, version 14.0 (StataCorp).
Results
A total of 347 women responded to the survey and met inclu-
sion criteria. They reported a total of 452 pregnancies during
residency. Given the methods of survey distribution, the re-
sponse rate could not be determined. Eighty-three percent of
respondents (273 of 327) had at least 1 pregnancy during clini-
cal(nonresearch)training,withmorethan25%(n = 100of346)
reporting more than 1 pregnancy during residency. Most preg-
nancies took place during or after the third postgraduate year.
Most respondents were residents of an academic training pro-
gram with at least 4 chief residents per class, with equal geo-
graphical representation from the 4 regions of the country
(West, Midwest, South, and Northeast) (Table 1).
Fifty-two percent of respondents (n = 180 of 346) agreed
with at least 1 statement of professional dissatisfaction. Thirty-
nine percent of respondents (n = 135 of 346) agreed with “con-
sidered leaving,” 27% of respondents (n = 94 of 346) agreed
with “revisit career choice,” and 30% (n = 102 of 346) agreed
with “advise against surgery.”
On univariate analysis, professional dissatisfaction was as-
sociated with perceptions of negative stigma during preg-

satisfaction with mentorship on integrating career with
motherhood, and changing subspecialty owing to perceived
difficulties balancing childbearing with the originally se-
lected subspecialty (Table 2).
Independent risk factors contributing to each of the 3 mea-
suresofprofessionaldissatisfactionarelistedinTable3.Chang-
ing subspecialty owing to the perceived challenges of balanc-
ing motherhood with the surgeon’
s original preference was
independently associated with agreement with all 3 state-
ments of professional discontent. Lack of formal institu-
tional maternity leave policy was associated with “consid-
ered leaving.” Perceptions of negative stigma associated with
pregnancy was associated with “revisit career choice.”
Fifty of 328 respondents (15.3%) altered their plans for fel-
lowship training owing to perceived challenges integrating
motherhood with their originally selected subspecialty. Those
who originally intended to pursue transplant (n = 5 of 8
[62.5%]), surgical oncology (n = 5 of 13 [38.46%]), and pedi-
atric surgery (n = 12 of 39 [30.77%]) fellowships were most
likely to change their postgraduate plans (Figure 1). These
women most commonly did not pursue fellowship (n = 16 of
50 [32.0%]), switched to breast surgery (n = 15 50 [30.0%]),
or switched to trauma and acute care surgery (n = 8 of 50
[16.0%]). Figure 2 demonstrates subsequent postgraduate or
fellowship plans of the 50 respondents who altered their fel-
lowship choices after their pregnancies.
Discussion
Theresultsofthisnationalsurveycharacterizedseveralsources
of professional dissatisfaction in participants who were preg-
nant and delivered a child during surgical training: (1) alter-
ing career trajectory owing to difficulty balancing childbear-
ing with the original choice of subspecialty, (2) lack of formal
institutional maternity leave policies, and (3) perception of a
negative stigma associated with pregnancy. This builds on pre-
vious work describing the experience of pregnancy during
residency11 by identifying the sources of greatest strain that
may benefit from increased support and intervention.
A 2018 report published by the American Medical Asso-
ciation projecting physician workforce volume predicted a
shortage of 29 000 surgeons by 2030.16 As demand for sur-
geons outpaces supply, resident attrition is of significant
concern.17,18 A 2017 meta-analysis6 showed that women leave
surgical training programs more often than their male coun-
terparts,commonlycitinguncontrollablelifestyleasthecause.
Thirty-ninepercentofparticipantsinoursurveyindicatedthey
had seriously considered leaving their residency, signifi-
cantly higher than the 15% reported among all general sur-
gery trainees in the 2008 National Study of Expectations and
Attitudes of Residents in Surgery survey.19 This suggests
women who become pregnant during training may be at par-
ticularly high risk for attrition.
Participants in this study who changed their fellowship
training plans owing to difficulty balancing pregnancy and
childcare with their original fellowship choice were at great-
est risk for professional discontent. Studies of the factors driv-
ing surgical career selection show both sexes place equal value
on interest in the field, intellectual challenge, technical as-
pects, and clinical opportunities, but women may be more
likely to be influenced by lifestyle when choosing their

this decision appears to affect both residency and overall ca-

tual rewards of a preferred subspecialty to reconcile domestic
duties may reduce enthusiasm to complete training. Role

lenge negative stereotypes23,24 and demonstrate that the re-
wards of the desired subspecialty are commensurate with the
commitment required to complete training. Women mentors

 essary to address different facets of their career.20,25 Struc-
tured mentoring programs and planned faculty-resident
social interactions have been shown to be effective in
reducing burnout,26 in encouraging pursuit of a particular
fellowship,27,28andinincreasingfacultyapproachabilitywhen
trainees face personal strain.29
Nearly half the respondents of this study reported their
training program lacked a formal maternity leave policy, which
was associated with the desire to withdraw from residency.
Other authors have suggested that pregnant residents in pro-
grams without detailed maternity policies experience nega-
tive influences from their colleagues who are asked to unex-
pectedly cover their workload.30 Structured service coverage
plans that provide equal distribution of responsibilities, with
the pregnant resident completing more difficult rotations ear-
lier in pregnancy, may reduce resentment from peers and in-
crease predictability in subsequent maternity leave. Support
for pregnancy in graduate medical education is widely vari-
able, with programs only required to comply with US govern-
ment laws. Although the American Board of Surgery reformat-
ted their website to clarify availability of flexible training
tracks,11,31,32 residency programs are not required by the Ac-
creditation Council for Graduate Medical Education to offer
thesealternatepathwaystoaccommodateparentalleave.33The
increased risk of residency dissatisfaction in participants from
programswithoutleavepoliciesdemonstratestheneedforcol-
laboration between surgical training program directors, Ac-
creditation Council for Graduate Medical Education leaders,
and the American Board of Surgery to form a unified stance
on parental leave policies including implementation of alter-
nate training tracks.

Limitations of this study include the method of survey distri-
bution,whichdidnotallowcalculationofaresponserate.How-
ever, given that the number of women who have been preg-

who had greater residency or career dissatisfaction were more
likely to participate in these interest groups or to reply to elec-
tronicrequestsforparticipationfromtheAssociationofWomen
Surgeons and program directors. Despite this, the study co-
hort exhibits a balance of program sizes and types and wide
geographic distribution. Additionally, response and social de-
sirability bias may be a factor in any self-reported data, with a
tendencyforparticipantstoanswerquestionsinawaythatwill
be viewed favorably. The factors driving subspecialty selec-
tion are complex, and it is possible that issues other than preg-
nancy and parenthood drove career changes. Future studies
with parallel data on training and career satisfaction of male
residents and female residents without children may provide
useful comparison with this cohort. Data about social and fi-
nancial supports, such as marital status, family assistance, and
annual income, which may have influenced career decisions
and the level of work-life conflicts, were not collected. Al-
though an effort was made to report the most contemporary
experience by including only responses from those who com-
pleted or were expected to complete residency 2007 or later,
responses are subject to recall bias. Lastly, the cross-

Conclusions
This is a pivotal time for sex equity in the workforce. Surgi-
cal training is at a crossroads, with lifestyle issues affecting
recruitment and retention. The rising number of women
beginning families during residency34 requires surgical lead-
ers and program directors to address the challenges faced by
childbearing trainees. This study shows that expectant resi-
dents who feel compelled to alter their fellowship plans
owing to family priorities, who lack maternity leave policies
at their training programs, and who perceive negative stigma
around pregnancy are at increased risk of experiencing
career dissatisfaction. Surgical training programs must
refine mentor-mentee relationships, targeting support in
work-life integration and fellowship selection. Interventions
at the program and national levels should focus on identify-
ing obstacles to maternity leave policies, designing a collab-
orative approach to implementation of flexible training
tracks, and examining methods to reduce maternal discrimi-
nation. This may improve professional fulfillment, reduce
attrition, and improve the residency experience for child-
bearing residents.
