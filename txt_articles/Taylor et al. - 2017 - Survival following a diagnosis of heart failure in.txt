Abstract
Background. Heart failure is a common long term condition affecting around 900 000 people in the 
UK and patients commonly present to primary care. 
The prognosis of patients with a code of heart 
failure in their primary care record is unknown.
Objective. The study sought to determine the overall survival rates for patients with heart failure 
in a primary care population from the time of diagnosis.
Methods. Survival analysis was carried out using UK primary care records from The Health 
Improvement Network (THIN) between 1 January 1998 and 31 December 2012. Patients age 45 or 
over with a first diagnostic label of heart failure were matched by age, sex and practice to people 
without heart failure. Outcome was death in the heart failure and no heart failure cohorts. Kaplan-
Meier curves were used to compare survival. Age-specific survival rates at 1, 5 and 10 years were 
determined for men and women with heart failure. Survival rates by year of diagnosis and case 
definition were also calculated.
Results. During the study period, 54 
313 patients had a first diagnostic code of heart failure. Overall 
survival rates for the heart failure group were 81.3% (95%CI 80.9–81.6), 51.5% (95%CI 51.0–52.0) and 
29.5% (95%CI 28.9–30.2) at 1, 5 and 10 years respectively and did not change over time.
Conclusions. In a primary care population, the survival of patients diagnosed with heart failure did 
not improved over time. Further research is needed to explain these trends and to find strategies 
to improve outlook.
Key words:  Community, heart failure, prognosis, primary care, survival.
Introduction
Heart failure is an important public health problem associ-
ated with significant morbidity and mortality for patients and 
high costs for healthcare systems (1). An estimated one to two 
in every 100 adults in Western populations are living with heart 
failure (2). In the UK, the costs of heart failure to the National 
Health Service (NHS) are second highest for any disease after 
stroke (3). Accurate estimates of heart failure prognosis are vital 
to healthcare commissioners to allow appropriate allocation of 
resources, to physicians in making management decisions and, 
perhaps most importantly, to patients to allow informed choices 
about treatments and end of life care (4).
Heart failure prognosis has previously been reported as worse 
than many cancers although the outcome of patients with heart 
failure is not always reliably recorded (5). Cancer registries help to 
identify patterns in both incidence and survival of common cancers

 and have reported significant improvements in prognosis over time 
(6). Global heart failure registries are lacking so outcomes have been 
established from hospital data and screening studies.
Analysis of hospital records from a cohort of 5.1 million 
patients in Scotland reported median survival rates of 1.33 years 
(95%CI 1.17–1.50) in men following a first hospitalisation for 
heart failure in 1986. With an increase in prescribing of evidence-
based treatments (angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors (ACE-
I), B blockers and mineralocorticoid receptor antagonists) survival 
at 1 year increased to 2.34 years (95%CI 2.15–2.56) by 2003 (7). 
More recent analysis of Medicare billing data in the US found 
that following an admission with heart failure, 67.4% of patients 
were readmitted to hospital within a year and 35.8% died within 
the same period (8). Heart failure requiring hospital admission 
therefore continues to have a poor outcome for patients and is also 
associated with significant healthcare costs arising from multiple 
admissions.
The outlook for participants in community screening studies is 
less bleak. In the Olmstead County population in the US, 1-year 
mortality was 21% for men and 17% for women and at 5 years 
was 50% and 46% for men and women, respectively (9). The 
Echocardiographic Heart Of England Screening (ECHOES) study, 
which screened a general population cohort in the UK over the age 
of 45, found a 5-year survival rate of 53% in participants with heart 
failure due to left ventricular systolic dysfunction (LVSD) (10).
Hospital data and screening studies however fail to explore 
the survival of patients who are diagnosed in a community setting 
and not necessarily admitted to hospital nor actively involved with 
screening for research purposes. Electronic primary care records 
provide a valuable source of data directly relevant to community 
populations (11). The computerisation of primary care in the UK 
and increasingly robust coding of medical information has led to 
the creation of large datasets which, following anonymization, 
can be used to explore epidemiological trends, including survival 
rates. The Health Improvement Network (THIN) is one of the larg-
est databases of general practice records in the world; it currently 
includes data from 587 practices in the UK, approximately 6% of 
the whole population (12).
The aim of this study was to determine the 1, 5 and 10-year sur-
vival rates of patients with heart failure in a primary care population 
and examine whether prognosis has improved over time.
Methods
Design
Survival analysis was carried out using an open matched retrospec-
tive cohort from THIN database for the period from 1 January 1998 
to 31 December 2012.
Setting
THIN is a primary care database containing routinely collected elec-
tronic patient records in the UK. At each consultation, the GP records 
details of the medical encounter, including diagnosis. Demographic 
details such as age, sex and linked deprivation scores also form part 
of the electronic record.

 Practices that contributed at least 1 year of clinical data were 
included in the study. In addition, because there may be under 
recording of mortality in earlier years, data were only included after 
each practice’s acceptable mortality reporting date (13). This is the 
date after which recorded mortality in the practice is consistent with 
predicted mortality. This was to ensure that the main outcome of 
interest was being accurately recorded by the participating practices.
Population
The dataset extracted from THIN database included all persons aged 
45 years and over, registered at a practice for at least 12 months dur-
ing the study period. This age cut-off was chosen because the types of 
heart failure affecting children and younger people are pathologically 
distinct from those found in older adults. Eligible cases had a clinical 
code of heart failure. The index date was the first date of a recorded 
heart failure code. Patients with a previous diagnosis of heart fail-
ure, either prior to age 45 or the study start date, were excluded. 
Cases were matched with up to five comparator patients who were 
registered in the same practice on the index date and did not have a 
diagnosis of heart failure on that date (but could become a case later). 
Comparators were also matched on sex and age ±5 years.
Clinical codes
Patients with a diagnosis of heart failure were identified using clinical 
codes input by GPs to record new diagnoses in the medical record. 
The NHS Clinical Terminology Browser and Quality and Outcomes 
Framework (QOF) guidelines were used to generate a comprehen-
sive list of clinical codes used to record a diagnosis (Supplementary 
Table S1). Heart failure is a clinical syndrome and the diagnosis 
requires the presence of symptoms and objective evidence of a struc-
tural or functional abnormality of the heart. Patients with a clinical 
code of heart failure and either an echocardiograph report or a hos-
pital letter were classified as being a confirmed case of heart failure 
and those with just a clinical code alone as an unconfirmed case.
Baseline variables
Demographic variables including age, sex, ethnicity, area depriva-
tion quintile, cardiovascular risk factors and co-morbidities were 
extracted. The latest deprivation quintile prior to the index date was 
used or, if unavailable, the most recently recorded after the index 
date. Cardiovascular risk factors (smoking, blood pressure, choles-
terol, body mass index (BMI)) were the most recently recorded prior 
to the index date. Cardiovascular co-morbidities (angina, myocar-
dial infarction (MI), ischaemic heart disease, diabetes, hypertension, 
stroke, atrial fibrillation (AF), valve disease), were defined by the 
presence of a clinical code at any time prior to the index date.
Outcome measure
The outcome measure was overall survival rate for the cohort which 
was determined using the date of death for patients who had died 
from any cause (all-cause mortality).
Statistical analyses
Data were extracted directly from THIN database using clinical 
codes. Analysis was carried out using Stata versions 10 and 11. The 
absolute number of heart failure cases, and overall incidence rate by 
age and sex, was calculated.
Heart failure patients and matched patients without heart fail-
ure, included in the survival analyses were followed until the earliest 
of the following dates: patient died, patient left (de-registered from) 
their practice, the practice ceased contributing data to THIN, or the 
study ended. Kaplan-Meier curves were used to compare survival in 
the heart failure and no heart failure cohorts. Log rank tests were 
used to compare survival between groups.
One-, five- and ten-year survival rates for the heart failure cohort 
were calculated by 10-year age band from the age of 45. For com-
parison, survival rates of the no heart failure cohort were also deter-
mined. To examine trends over time, age-sex specific and overall 
survival rates were calculated by year of diagnosis. Case definition 
was also explored by calculating overall survival rates by year of 
diagnosis for the confirmed and unconfirmed heart failure groups 
separately.
Results
Five hundred and sixty four practices contributed at least 1 year 
of data between 1 January 1998 and 31 December 2012. A total

patients had a new clinical code of heart failure during the study 
period. Overall heart failure incidence was 3.00 (95%CI 2.98–3.03) 
per 1000 person-years, increasing with age and higher in men than 
women in every age band. Incidence of heart failure in age group 
65 and older was 6.78 (95% CI 6.72–6.84) per 1000 person-years 
and in the age group 75 years and older was 10.86 (95%CI 10.74–
10.97) per 1000 person-years.
Survival in heart failure and no heart failure cohorts
The characteristics of patients with and without heart failure are 
shown in Table 1. All five Townsend deprivation quintiles were 
similarly represented except for the most deprived group which 
had around one-third less cases than the other four groups. BMI 
was similar but there were 1.2% more smokers in the heart failure 
group. Cardiovascular co-morbidities, particularly ischaemic heart 
disease, AF and valvular disease were more common in patients 
with heart failure.
Overall, heart failure cases had a significantly worse progno-
sis than comparators (log rank test, chi-square (1) 12 
732.59, 1, 
P < 0.0001). The survival rates for the heart failure cohort, and age, 
sex and practice matched cohort without heart failure, are shown in 
Table 2. Overall survival rates in the heart failure group were 81.3% 
(95%CI 80.9–81.6) at 1 year from date of diagnosis, 51.5% (95%CI 
51.0–52.0) at 5 years and 29.5% (95%CI 28.9–30.2) at 10 years.
Survival over time
The survival rates of all heart failure cases by year of diagnosis 
are shown in Figure 1. One- and five-year survival rates remained 
stable during the study period at 80% and 50%, respectively. Ten-
year survival rates for those diagnosed between 1998 and 2002 
were 28%.

 One-, five- and ten-year survival rates for men and women by age 
group are shown in Figure 2a–c, respectively. Survival rates for all 
groups did not change significantly over time.
Survival by case definition
The number of confirmed cases (13 
773) made up just over a quar-
ter (26.5%) of the total number of heart failure cases (54 
313) in 
the dataset overall and did not increase significantly over a 10-year 
period. Cases with confirmed heart failure were younger and 56% 
were male compared to 50% in the unconfirmed group. The pro-
portion of patients in each Townsend quintile was similar for con-
firmed and unconfirmed cases. There were 2% more smokers in 
the confirmed compared to the unconfirmed heart failure group. 
Ischaemic heart disease, angina and MI were all more common in 
the confirmed group.
The overall survival rates were lower in the unconfirmed heart 
failure group than in the confirmed heart failure group (log rank 
test, chi-square (1) 170.37, 1, P < 0.0001). Figure 3 shows 1-, 5- and 
10-year survival rates in the confirmed and unconfirmed heart fail-
ure groups over time. The unconfirmed heart failure group had an 
overall 5% lower survival rate at 1, 5 and 10 years.
Conclusions
This study provides contemporary survival rate estimates for patients 
with a first diagnostic code of heart failure in their GP record. The 
outlook for patients with heart failure did not improve over time. 
Patients with a confirmed diagnosis had a slightly better outcome 
than those that were unconfirmed.
The cohort in this analysis included 54 
313 patients with heart 
failure, much larger than most prospective studies, and the follow-up

 period was over a 15-year period. The NHS provides healthcare to 
the entire population of the UK, free at the point of access and most 
patients are registered with a primary care provider. Unlike screening 
cohort studies, primary care databases do not rely on participants 
volunteering to take part in the study rather they represent a cross-
section of the entire population. These results are therefore likely to 
be generalizable to the community population as a whole (14). The 
large number of patients in each age and sex category also improves 
the accuracy of the survival rate estimates.
The main limitation of the study is the reliability of GP coding. 
Research using general practice databases is reliant on the accuracy 
of clinical coding input by GPs during the consultation. Heart fail-
ure is a chronic condition which is often insidious in onset and can 
masquerade as other conditions making early and accurate diagno-
sis difficult. Over time the use and accuracy of clinical coding has 
improved, particularly since the introduction of the QOF in 2004 
(15). The definition of heart failure has also changed over time 
leading to dysynchrony between epidemiological studies, making 
comparison difficult, and the meaning of a code for heart failure 
in an individual’s medical record may be based on different criteria 
depending on the accepted definition at the time of diagnosis. The 
benefit of THIN and similar primary care databases are that they 
provide an insight into real-life general practice and the survival 
rates of patients with a clinical code of heart failure in their record is 
likely to be an important statistic for practising GPs.
There is a paucity of contemporary epidemiological informa-
tion on heart failure from a primary care setting. Annual QOF data 
shows a prevalence of 0.8–0.9% each year since the introduction of 
the heart failure indicator in 2006 but the number of new cases per 
year is not recorded (16). National heart statistics include heart fail-
ure incidence and mortality within an umbrella term of ‘cardiovascu-
lar disease’ so estimates for heart failure alone are lacking. Survival

 rate estimates have therefore come from screened cohorts and hospi-
tal databases. The ECHOES study is one of the few studies to report 
10-year, as well as 5-year, survival rates (10). All deaths in the cohort 
were collated from routinely collected mortality data. Overall the 
mortality rate for all-cause heart failure was 9% per year; survival 
was 53% at 5 years and 27% at 10 years. The overall 10-year sur-
vival rate of 29.5% for the heart failure group in the THIN study is 
therefore similar to the screened population in ECHOES.
Sweden has well-developed, high-quality health registries which 
allow more detailed examination of the epidemiology of diseases. 
A cross-sectional study of 2.1 million residents of the Stockholm 
region was carried out using an administrative health data register 
(17). Between 2006 and 2010, the incidence of heart failure was 
3.8 per 1000 person-years. The overall 5-year survival rate in the 
Swedish study was 48%, similar to the THIN study results, how-
ever between 2006 and 2010 there was a 19% decrease in mortality 
in both men and women (P < 0.001). A study of the Framingham 
cohort in the US also found an overall improvement in survival of 
12% per decade between 1950 and 2000 (18).
Cancer survival rates in the UK have doubled in the last 40 years 
(19), yet in this study the outlook for patients with a first diagnostic 
label of heart failure has not improved over time. More research 
is needed into the disease trajectory and management of heart fail-
ure in order to explain the lack of improvement in survival over 
time despite the availability of evidence-based therapies shown to 
improve outcomes in clinical trials. This study did not examine med-
ication use following a heart failure diagnosis and this is an area 
of planned further work. The treatment used in heart failure with 
reduced ejection fraction have not shown the same benefit in patients 
with heart failure with preserved ejection fraction which may partly 
explain lack of survival improvement. It was not possible to differen-
tiate the type of heart failure due to lack of specific coding based on 
ejection fraction. However, as heart failure with preserved ejection 
fraction is increasingly recognised, and therefore more likely to be 
coded, further analysis by subtype may become possible.
The results of this study are estimates at a population level but 
discussions with the individual patient require tailored statistics and 
information in a form that patients and their carers can understand. 
Prognostic estimates vary depending on age and sex but also other 
co-morbidities, treatments and variables such as blood pressure and 
ejection fraction (20). Prognostic modelling to include other varia-
bles from the THIN database to more accurately predict survival for 
individual patients is also an area where further research is planned.
