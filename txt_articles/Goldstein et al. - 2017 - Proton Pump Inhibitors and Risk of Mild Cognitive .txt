Abstract
Background/Objective—Controversy exists over whether proton pump inhibitors (PPIs) 
increase risk for dementia. This study examined the risk associated with PPIs on conversion to 
mild cognitive impairment (MCI), dementia, and specifically Alzheimer’s disease (AD).
Design—Observational, longitudinal study.
Setting—Tertiary academic Alzheimer Disease research centers funded by the National Institute 
on Aging.
Participants—Research volunteers ≥ 50 years old with 2 to 6 annual visits. Eight hundred and 
eighty four were taking PPIs at every visit, 1,925 took PPIs intermittently, whereas 7,677 never 
reported taking PPIs. All had baseline normal cognition or MCI.
Analytic Plan—Multivariable Cox regression analyses evaluated the association between PPI 
use and annual conversion of baseline normal cognition into MCI or dementia, or annual 
conversion of baseline MCI into dementia, controlling for demographics, vascular comorbidities, 
mood, and anticholinergics and histamine-2 receptor antagonists.
Results—Continuous (Always vs. Never) PPI use was associated with a decreased risk of decline 
in cognitive function (HR 0.78, 95% CI 0.66–0.93, p=.005) and decreased risk of conversion to

 MCI or dementia due to AD (HR 0.82, 95% CI 0.69–0.98, p=.026). Intermittent use was also 
associated with decreased risk of decline in cognitive function (HR 0.84, 95% CI 0.76–0.93), p=.
001) and risk of conversion to MCI or dementia due to AD (HR 0.82, 95% CI 0.74–0.91), p=.001). 
This reduced risk was found for persons with either normal cognition or MCI.
Conclusion—PPIs were not associated with greater risk of dementia or of AD, in contrast to 
recent reports. Study limitations include reliance on self-reported PPI use and the lack of 
dispensing data. Prospective studies are needed to confirm these results in order to guide 
empirically based clinical treatment recommendations.

INTRODUCTION
Proton pump inhibitors (PPIs) are a class of drugs prescribed to treat gastrointestinal 
disorders such as duodenal ulcers and gastroesophageal reflux disease by reducing gastric 
acid secretion. The safety of PPIs with respect to cognitive functioning, including the risk 
for dementia and Alzheimer’s disease, has recently been questioned. Two studies reported a 
detrimental impact of PPIs in increasing the risk for incident dementia and Alzheimer’s 
disease (AD) in persons ≥ 75 years of age, raising concerns about their widespread use 
among older adults.1,2 Haenisch and colleagues’2 investigation included 3,076 persons (23% 
PPI users) who were enrolled in the multicenter German Study of Aging, Cognition and 
Dementia in Primary Care Patients. These community residing participants were ≥ 75 years 
and were judged to be non-demented at baseline as determined by a battery of measures 
from the Structured Interview for Diagnosis of Dementia of Alzheimer type, Multi-infarct 
Dementia and Dementia of other Aetiology (SIDAM)3 consisting of the Mini-Mental State 
Examination, activities of daily living scale, and the Hachinski-Rosen Scale. These measures 
were repeated at 18 month intervals. The investigators found an increased risk of both 
dementia (HR 1.38, 95% CI 1.04–1.83, p=.02) and AD (HR 1.44, 95% CI 1.01–2.06, p=.04) 
in PPI users compared to non-users over a follow-up interval of 72 months. A subsequent 
study by the same investigators1 utilized the claims data of the largest healthcare insurance 
company in Germany. The inpatient and outpatient diagnoses over a seven year period were 
examined for 73,679 individuals (4% PPI users) ≥ 75 years old with and without a dementia 
diagnosis at baseline. PPI users had a significantly increased risk of incident dementia 
compared to non-users (HR 1.44, 95% CI 1.36–1.52, p<.001).
As noted by Kuller,4 the finding of a 1.4 increased risk for dementia with PPI use in the 
studies by Haenish and colleagues would confer an increase of 10,000 new cases of 
dementia each year in persons 75–84 years old. However, a recent case control study5 on 
risk factors for dementia, also conducted in Germany, did not observe an increased risk. 
Booker and colleagues obtained general practitioner medical record information from a 
database of patients 70–90 years old with a diagnosis of dementia (n=11,956; % PPI 
use=44.3) or without a diagnosis of dementia (n=11,956, % PPI use=45.8) over a five year 
period. PPIs were associated with a decreased risk of developing dementia (HR 0.93, 95% 
CI 0.90–0.97).

 PPI use has risen in the United States, as reported in the National Health and Nutrition 
Examination Survey in which the prevalence of prescription PPIs significantly increased 
from 4.9–8.3 in persons 40–64 years old over the time span of 1999–2012.6 We therefore 
believed it was important to investigate PPI use and risk of mild cognitive impairment (MCI) 
and dementia. The sample included individuals enrolled in the NIH-NIA supported 
Alzheimer’s Disease Centers (ADCs), a nationwide consortium of research sites in the 
United States. Subjects underwent detailed annual neuropsychological evaluations. We 
examined the risk associated with PPI use on incident MCI, dementia, and specifically 
Alzheimer’s disease (AD). Our second aim was to examine in a subgroup of persons with 
mild cognitive impairment at baseline whether PPI use conferred a higher risk of dementia 
and AD conversion in an already vulnerable group compared to persons with normal 
cognitive functioning. Analyses controlled for histamine-2 receptor antagonist (H2RA) 
medications (cimetidine, ranitidine, famotidine, and nizatidine) as these are an alternative 
treatment for gastric-acid related disorders. Boustani and colleagues7 found that H2RAs 
were a risk factor for incident cognitive impairment in a community residing sample of 
African Americans who were ≥65 years old. In contrast, PPIs were not associated with an 
increased risk. As prior studies did not control for H2RA medications, it was important to 
determine if they accounted for the conflicting findings.
METHODS
Participants
We used information in the National Alzheimer’s Coordinating Center (NACC) database8 
from 33 ADCs from September 2005 through September 2015. Written consent was 
obtained using forms approved by the institutional review boards at each site. Participants 
included persons with a baseline diagnosis of either ‘normal cognition’ or ‘mild cognitive 
impairment’ by their ADC clinicians. Clinical diagnosis at each Center relies on ADC 
coding guidelines using not only the performance on a core battery of neuropsychological 
tests9 but also the Clinical Dementia Rating10 score which provides an index of cognitive 
and functional status via a structured interview with the participant, a separate interview 
with the study informant, and a behavioral and neurological exam. A diagnosis of ‘normal 
cognition’ requires that neuropsychological test scores are within expectation for age and 
that persons are able to independently perform instrumental activities of daily living. A 
diagnosis of ‘MCI’ requires impairment in a single cognitive domain or multiple domains 
but also evidence of independence in performing activities of daily living.11
Criteria for inclusion of cognitively normal controls and MCI participants in the current 
study were information about PPI medication use at every visit, age ≥ 50 years old at 
baseline, and a consistent conversion diagnosis over time (e.g., conversion from normal 
cognition to MCI but then not back to normal cognition on the next visit).
PPI Medications
Participants were classified as PPI users vs. non-users at each annual visit, based on 
information on self- and informant-reported PPI medications. Theseincluded Omeprazole 
(Prilosec) and Omeprazole-sodium bicarbonate (Zegerid), esomeprazole (Nexium),

 lansoprazole (Prevacid), pantoprazole (Protonix), rabeprazole (Aciphex), and 
dexlansoprazole (Dexilant, Kapidex).
Statistical Analyses
Analyses included participants taking PPI medications at every visit, those taking PPI 
medications intermittently, vs. those never taking PPI medications. Multivariable Cox 
regression analyses using PROC PHREG were performed to evaluate the association 
between PPI use (always or intermittently vs. never) and a decline to MCI or dementia in the 
combined population of those either normal or MCI at baseline. Follow-up time was the time 
variable in the regression, beginning with the baseline visit. This was defined as the time to 
decline for those who did decline, and as the follow-up time for those who did not decline. 
In addition, a similar regression was run in which the outcome was a decline in cognitive 
status specifically to an underlying AD etiology (conversion to either MCI with suspected 
AD etiology or probable AD), in which MCI due to other suspected etiologies and non-AD 
dementias were treated as censored. Finally, separate regressions were run for persons with 
normal cognition at baseline versus those with MCI at baseline to determine whether one 
diagnostic group was more vulnerable to the adverse effects of PPIs on the risk of decline. 
Proportional hazard assumptions were tested via an interaction term between PPI use and 
follow-up time. No violation of the proportional hazard function was found for PPI. 
Statistical significance was set at p<.05, two-tailed.
All models controlled for potential confounders including demographic variables (age at 
baseline, race, gender, education), vascular comorbidities (self-reported hypertension, 
diabetes, heart disease, stroke/transient ischemic attack), mood (depression), and 
anticholinergic and histamine-2 receptor antagonist medications. Information on vascular 
comorbidities and mood were taken from the NACC Uniform Data Set Subject Health 
History form which enquires about whether a person has a recent/active diagnosis in the past 
two years. Information about medications was taken from the NACC Uniform Data Set 
Subject Medications form which enquires about use of prescription and commonly 
prescribed over the counter medications within the two weeks before the current visit. The 
form lists 100 drugs most commonly reported by NACC participants. Additional drugs and 
their associated DrugIDs are available by accessing a website (https//alz.washington.edu/
MEMBER/DrugCodeLookUp.html). In the current study, medications were classified into 
H2RAs (cimetidine, ranitidine, famotidine, and nizatidine)7 and those with moderate to 
severe anticholinergic effects.12
RESULTS
Figure 1 shows the number of participants initially reviewed for study inclusion. Of 12,416 
potential individuals with baseline diagnoses of normal cognition and MCI, a total of 1,930 
were excluded for reasons outlined in the Figure. Of the remaining 10,486 eligible 
participants, 884 (8.4%) reported always using PPIs, 1,925 (18.4%) reported intermittent 
use, and 7,677 (73.2%) reported never using PPIs at any annual follow-up.
Table 1 shows the demographic and clinical characteristics of the always, intermittent, and 
never PPI users. A significantly higher percentage of never PPI users had achieved high

 school or above levels of education compared to those with intermittent PPI use. Always and 
intermittent PPI users were significantly older) than the never PPI users In addition, 
compared to the never PPI users, a significantly higher percentage of always and intermittent 
PPI users had heart disease, diabetes, hypertension, stroke/TIA, and depression, and a higher 
percentage of individuals in these latter groups took anticholinergic medications. All three 
groups differed from each other in the percentage of H2RA medication use 
(intermittent>always>never) and the number of follow-up visits 
(intermittent>never>always).
Risk for Cognitive Decline and Alzheimer’s Disease
We first evaluated whether persons who did not have a dementia diagnosis at baseline were 
at an increased risk for conversion to a diagnosis of cognitive decline (transition from 
normal cognition to MCI or dementia; transition from MCI to dementia) as a function of PPI 
use. As seen in Table 2 (left side), the use of PPIs in the always user group was associated 
with a decreased risk of a decline in cognitive status (HR 0.78, 95% CI 0.66–0.93, p=.005) 
after adjusting for potential confounders. Intermittent PPI use was also associated with a 
decreased risk of decline (HR 0.84, 95% CI 0.76–0.93, p<.001). The NACC database 
contains information concerning the suspected etiology for MCI or dementia, thus allowing 
us to examine if PPI use was associated with a risk for probable AD. PPI use in the always 
user group (Table 2, right side) was associated with a decreased risk of conversion to MCI or 
dementia due to AD (HR 0.82, 95% CI 0.69–0.98, p=.026), as was intermittent use of PPIs 
(HR 0.82, 95% CI 0.74–0.91, p<.001),after adjusting for potential confounders. Figure 2 
shows the adjusted survival curves of cognitive decline to MCI or dementia (Panel A) and 
specifically to MCI or dementia due to suspected AD (Panel B). As seen, always PPI users 
had the highest survival rate, with intermittent users in the middle and never PPI users in the 
lowest group. The former groups both had higher and comparable rates of survival relative to 
the never PPI users for the transition to MCI or dementia due to AD.
Subgroup Analyses as a Function of Baseline Cognitive Status
A. Persons with Normal Cognition—Persons diagnosed with normal cognition at 
baseline (n=7,404, of whom 613 (8.3%) were always users, 1,351 (18.2%) were intermittent 
users, and 5,440 (73.5%) were never users) were examined separately to determine their 
relative risk for conversion to cognitive impairment (MCI or dementia) with vs. without AD 
etiology. Supplementary Table S1 shows the relative risk of conversion to MCI/dementia of 
any etiology (left side) and to an AD etiology (right side), controlling for potential 
confounders. PPI use in the always user group was associated with a decreased risk for the 
transition to MCI or dementia with any etiology (HR 0.73, 95% CI 0.55–0.97, p=.03), but 
was not a significant risk factor for an AD etiology (HR 0.74, CI 0.53–1.04, p=.08). 
Intermittent PPI use was not a significant risk factor for a decline in cognitive status due to 
any etiology (HR 0.87, 95% CI 0.74–1.01, p=.07) or to an AD etiology (HR 0.86, 95% CI 
0.71–1.04, p=.13).
B. Persons with MCI—Of 3,082 persons with MCI at baseline, 271 (8.8%) were always 
PPI users, 574 (18.6%) were intermittent users, and 2,237 (72.6%) were never users. As seen 
in Supplementary Table S2 (left side), the relative risk for conversion to dementia of any

 etiology (HR 0.86, 95% CI 0.76–0.98, p=.03) and to an AD etiology (HR 0.83, 95% CI 
0.73–0.94, p=.01) was significantly reduced in the intermittent PPI users, whereas there was 
no significant reduction in risk for dementia due to any etiology (HR 0.83, 95% CI 0.67–
1.02, p=.08) or an AD etiology (HR 0.97, 95% CI 0.79–1.19, p=.78) in those who always 
used PPIs.
Association Between Age and PPI Use
We restricted the sample to persons ≥ 75 years old because prior studies1,2,5 investigated the 
risk for cognitive decline only in persons in their 7th decade. The risk for cognitive decline in 
non-demented persons with normal cognition or MCI at baseline (n=4,562) was significantly 
reduced in intermittent PPI users (HR 0.85, 95% CI 0.75–0.96, p=.009)), with a similar trend 
in always users) (HR 0.81, 95% CI 0.66–1.00, p=.049).
DISCUSSION
The results do not confirm reports1,2 that PPIs are linked to an increased risk of dementia 
and AD. Non-demented individuals at baseline who either always or intermittently took PPIs 
demonstrated a lower risk for cognitive decline compared to individuals who did not take 
PPIs. In addition, consistent and intermittent use was associated with a lower risk for decline 
due to a suspected AD etiology. When the sample was divided into those with either normal 
cognition or MCI, the same finding of a reduced risk was observed for both groups taking 
PPIs.
A strength of our study includes the well-phenotyped sample of individuals that receive 
diagnoses of cognitive status by a team of experienced clinicians in academic medical 
centers. ADC clinicians rely on a comprehensive neuropsychological battery and an 
independent interview with a study partner to obtain information about a person’s functional 
status. Two of the previous investigations1,2 in primary care patients relied on administrative 
databases using the diagnoses of a diverse group of practitioners presumably with varying 
degrees of experience in diagnosing dementia. Cognitive impairment and dementia are both 
underdiagnosed and underreported in primary care patients in the United States.13,14 
Another strength is the availability of a broader age range of individuals, since prior studies 
only included persons in their 7th decade.1,2,5 We also controlled for H2RA use which was 
not previously done.1,2 Instead, these investigations included polypharmacy, defined as 
taking ≥5 drugs, as a covariate. This may or may not have included H2RAs which are an 
older class of drugs used to treat GI disorders. Boustani and colleagues7 found that H2RAs 
increased the risk for incident cognitive impairment more than two-fold in community 
residing African Americans, whereas there was no increased risk with PPIs. Failure of prior 
studies to control for H2RAs could have produced varying results depending on the mix of 
medications in the polypharmacy category. In our study, unlike Boustani et al., we found that 
H2RAs decreased the risk of MCI and dementia, including AD. Our sample was more 
heterogeneous in age and race which may have contributed to the differences in findings. 
Gray et al.15 more recently reported that H2RA use was not a risk factor for dementia or AD 
in participants in the Adult Changes in Thought (ACT) study. Strengths included the ability

 to evaluate exposure over a decade before enrollmen, and detailed information using 
pharmacy records that allowed them to examine dose-response relationships as risk factors.
Our findings replicate the results of a recent study by Booker and colleagues,5 but they 
conflict with two other reports1,2 demonstrating a detrimental influence of PPIs. The 
conflicting findings from the latter two reports cannot be attributed to differences in the 
classes of PPI medications that were used for analyses, as they were the same in our study. 
Information concerning dosage and schedule of PPI use was not available in the NACC 
database. This lack of dispensing data is also a limitation of other recent published reports.
1,2,5 Another limitation concerns a reliance in our study on self-reports. This may have 
resulted in misclassification bias due to persons forgetting their medications, especially in 
those with MCI. This bias could have also occurred in the finding by Haenisch and collegues 
of detrimental associations of PPIs with cognition since they relied on interviews.2 All 
studies, including ours, lacked information on compliance with PPIs. Finally, in the 
analyses, we used all the available information and did not consider the missed visits. For 
example, a participant who was normal at baseline may have skipped a year 2 follow-up. If 
there were records of PPI use at all the available visits, we considered that person a PPI user 
at year 2. If the diagnosis was MCI at year-3, we would classify conversion at year 3 despite 
the missing of year 2 follow-up information. This could have led to misclassification of PPI 
use and/or time to diagnosis. Haenisch et al.2 used a last observation carried forward 
approach which could have led to similar misclassification.
Other risk factors for dementia and AD were replicated across all studies, involving older 
age, greater depression, and diabetes and stroke. As in all observational 
pharmacoepidemiological studies, biased by indication may be skewing these results to 
suggest that PPIs are not detrimental to cognition. In this analysis, we found that PPI users 
were at higher risk of dementia by their higher prevalence of CV disease, hypertension, 
diabetes, and depression. Hence, it is unlikely that our observation is related to a bias to 
prescribing PPIs to healthier individuals. It is possible that the PPI users, due to the greater 
frequency of cardiovascular risk factors, received better healthcare than non-PPI users. This, 
in turn, could have reduced their dementia risk.
Our findings do not support a detrimental impact of PPIs, despite mechanisms proposed as 
to why they should result in an increased risk for dementia. It has been hypothesized that 
PPIs are associated with increased beta amyloid which, in turn, is involved in the 
pathogenesis of AD. Badioloa and collegues16 observed increased beta amyloid levels in an 
amyloid cell model and in mice after PPI treatment. A human clinical trial demonstrating 
changes in cognitive functioning as well as both cerebrospinal fluid and neuroimaging 
biomarkers of AD linked to PPI use would support these findings. Another potential 
mechanism involves the role of vitamin B12, given an association between PPIs and B12 
deficiency.17 Certain PPI medications including lansoprazole and omeprazole have been 
found to cross the blood brain barrier, demonstrating that they directly impact the brain.18,19 
Caution needs to be exercised on speculating about the impact of PPIs on brain functioning, 
however, until a randomized, prospective clinical trial elucidates the impact of PPIs on 
cognition.
