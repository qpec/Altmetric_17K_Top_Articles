(re-
peated hot tub or sauna use) reduces cardiovascular risk, but its effects
on the mechanisms underlying improvements in microvascular func-
tion have yet to be studied. We investigated the effects of heat therapy
on microvascular function and whether improvements were related to
changes in nitric oxide (NO) bioavailability using cutaneous micro-
dialysis. Eighteen young, sedentary, otherwise healthy subjects par-
ticipated in 8 wk of heat therapy (hot water immersion to maintain
rectal temperature �38.5°C for 60 min/session; n � 9) or thermo-
neutral water immersion (sham, n � 9), and participated in experi-
ments before and after the 8-wk intervention in which forearm
cutaneous hyperemia to 39°C local heating was assessed at three
microdialysis sites receiving 1) Lactated Ringer’s (Control), 2) N�-
nitro-L-arginine (L-NNA; nonspecific NO synthase inhibitor), and 3)
4-hydroxy-2,2,6,6-tetramethylpiperidine-1-oxyl (Tempol), a superox-
ide dismutase mimetic. The arm used for microdialysis experiments
remained out of the water at all times. Data are means � SE cutaneous
vascular conductance (CVC � laser Doppler flux/mean arterial pres-
sure), presented as percent maximal CVC (% CVCmax). Heat therapy
increased local heating plateau from 42 � 6 to 53 � 6% CVCmax
(P � 0.001) and increased NO-dependent dilation (difference in
plateau between Control and L-NNA sites) from 26 � 6 to 38 � 4%
CVCmax (P � 0.01), while no changes were observed in the sham group.
When data were pooled across all subjects at 0 wk, Tempol had no effect
on the local heating response (P � 0.53 vs. Control). There were no
changes at the Tempol site across interventions (P � 0.58). Passive heat
therapy improves cutaneous microvascular function by improving NO-
dependent dilation, which may have clinical implications.

NEW & NOTEWORTHY
We showed for the first time that passive heat therapy improves
cutaneous microvascular function in humans via improved
nitric oxide (NO)-dependent dilation. This is the first study to
investigate the mechanisms underlying improvements in vascu-
lar health associated with heat therapy. Our data add to the
currently limited but strong evidence suggesting heat therapy
could be a powerful novel tool for improving cardiovascular
health, particularly in disease states characterized by impaired
vascular function secondary to reduced NO bioavailability.
PASSIVE HEAT THERAPY IS a novel intervention for improving
cardiovascular health that may prove to be a viable alternative
for a variety of patient populations, particularly those who are
unable to exercise at an extent great enough to induce cardio-
protective effects. Short-term (2-3 wk) sauna therapy has been
shown to improve some aspects of conduit vessel function in
patients with elevated cardiovascular risk (25, 30). Recently,
we reported that 8 wk of heat therapy improves conduit vessel
endothelial-dependent dilation and arterial stiffness in young,
sedentary individuals (47). However, microvascular dysfunc-
tion often precedes dysfunction in the conduit vessels (1).
Furthermore, microvascular dysfunction is attributable to im-
paired nitric oxide (NO) signaling in the majority of cardio-
vascular-related diseases. Therefore, developing novel strate-
gies to specifically target this important vascular bed is of
critical importance. Few studies to date have investigated the
effects of heat therapy on microvascular function in humans,
and none have investigated the molecular mechanisms that
underscore potential adaptions.
In humans, the cutaneous circulation offers an ideal site to
study microvascular function. The accessibility of the skin
allows the molecular pathways to be studied easily and rela-
tively noninvasively using cutaneous microdialysis. A com-
monly used test of cutaneous microvascular function is thermal
hyperemia, in which the skin is locally heated to 39–42°C,
producing a biphasic vasodilator response (9, 19, 33, 35).
Importantly, thermal hyperemia has been shown to be impaired
under a variety of disease conditions (3, 36, 42, 44) and to
mirror microvascular dysfunction in other microvascular beds.
For example, thermal hyperemia is substantially impaired in
diseases such as end-stage renal disease (31), essential hyper-
tension (40), type II diabetes mellitus (11), and coronary artery
disease (2), all of which are characterized by impaired micro-
vascular function independent of changes in the cutaneous
circulation. Furthermore, the secondary plateau phase is pri-
marily dependent on NO (9, 29, 35). Given that the majority of
disease states are characterized by impaired NO-dependent
dilation and that the skin offers an accessible means of inves-
tigating the underlying mechanisms of microvascular function,
thermal hyperemia is an ideal test for assessing the potential
therapeutic effects of heat therapy on the microvasculature.
Only one study has so far investigated the effects of chronic
passive heating on cutaneous thermal hyperemia. Carter et al.
(7) showed that 8 wk of lower limb heating sufficient to raise
body core temperature by 0.5–1.0°C increased the cutaneous
forearm response to a local thermal stimulus. However, a few
limitations to this study warrant further investigation. For
example, maximal vasodilation at the skin sites were not
obtained, a commonly performed practice to account for lim-
itations in the laser Doppler flowmetry technique (12). In this
setting, recording maximal skin blood flow is necessary to
determine whether any observed changes were due to a struc-

 tural or functional improvement. Additionally, to test micro-
vascular function, a slow local heating protocol to 42°C was
utilized, which has been shown in microdialysis studies to be
only �30% NO dependent (9) and to be confounded by axon
reflex involvement (24). Furthermore, the underlying mecha-
nisms were not investigated, so it is unknown whether the
improvements in skin blood flow were due to improved NO
bioavailability.
NO bioavailability and cutaneous thermal hyperemia can
also be limited by oxidative stress (33). The effects of oxida-
tive stress can by investigated via microdialysis using 4-hy-
droxy-2,2,6,6-tetramethylpiperidine-1-oxyl (Tempol), a super-
oxide dismutase mimetic. While Tempol has been shown to
have no effect in young, recreationally active subjects when
locally heating to 42°C (33), this protocol elicits vasodilation
to �85–95% of maximal, and so a ceiling effect may have
been observed. The effects of Tempol have not yet been
investigated using local heating to 39°C, which reaches a
plateau of �40–60% of maximal (9), allowing the effects of
pharmacological agents and/or interventions which may in-
crease observation of vasodilation. Additionally, Tempol has
not been investigated in sedentary subjects or following long-
term heat therapy. It has been reported that short-term heat
acclimation (�14 days) can increase total peroxide concentra-
tion and oxidative stress index (28). However, heat shock
proteins, which are elevated following heat acclimation (32),
can increase expression of antioxidative enzymes, including
superoxide dismutase (10).
Therefore, we investigated the effects of 8 wk of passive
heat therapy on cutaneous microvascular function, consisting
of four to five sessions per wk in which rectal temperature (Tre)
was maintained at �38.5°C for 60 min per session throughout
the 8 wk. The arm used for microdialysis studies was kept out
of the water the entire time so that adaptations would be
induced by systemic increases in body core temperature rather
than increases in local skin temperature. We chose to study
sedentary (but otherwise healthy) subjects to investigate the
mechanisms of how heat therapy affects microvascular func-
tion without the confounding factors of a disease state, while
still providing translatability of our data by studying a popu-
lation with elevated vascular risk. To assess cutaneous micro-
vascular function, we utilized rapid local heating to 39°C, a
thermal hyperemia protocol which is �80% dependent on NO
(9). Specifically, we hypothesized that, compared with a sham
group (thermoneutral water immersion), 8 wk of heat therapy
would improve the overall plateau response of 39°C cutaneous
thermal hyperemia by improving NO-dependent dilation [in-
vestigated by delivering a NO synthase (NOS) inhibitor via
microdialysis]. Second, we hypothesized that Tempol would
augment thermal hyperemia in sedentary subjects prior to heat
therapy, and that Tempol-mediated dilation (the difference
between Control and Tempol microdialysis sites, indicative of
oxidative stress) would decrease with 8 wk of heat therapy.
METHODS

 The study was registered as a clinical trial at clinicaltrials.
gov (NCT02518399; https://www.clinicaltrials.gov/ct2/show/
NCT02518399?term�heat�therapy&rank�1). Included in this
study were the same subjects as those in which we measured
macrovascular function (on separate experimental days), as pub-
lished previously (47).
Intervention
Upon enrollment, subjects were assigned by investigators to par-
ticipate in either 8 wk of heat therapy or thermoneutral water immer-
sion (sham group). Due to the smaller cohort size, subjects were not
randomly assigned to groups, but were instead assigned by investiga-
tors to match sex, age, body mass index (BMI), and time of year
across the groups. Of the 27 subjects initially enrolled, 24 completed
the initial (0 wk) testing, 23 initiated participation in the intervention,
and 20 completed the full 8 wk intervention. Of these 20, data were
analyzed from 18 (n � 9 in each group). One subject elected not to
participate in the microdialysis experiments, and we excluded data
from one subject in which we experienced technical difficulties
(nonphysiological responses across the sites, most likely due to a
heater malfunction). Although outside temperature varied over the
course of the study, similar numbers of subjects participated in the
heat therapy and sham groups in each season. Subjects were instructed
to maintain any regular physical activity (such as walking to school or
work) consistently across the 8 wk and to avoid hot tub or sauna use
outside of the lab. No subjects traveled to warmer climates at least 2
mo prior to or during the 8-wk intervention.
Subjects reported to the laboratory four to five times per week for
heat therapy or thermoneutral water immersion sessions (36 sessions
total across the 8 wk). All subjects provided a first-morning urine
sample prior to each session to ensure euhydration [urine specific
gravity (USG) �1.02]. If USG was �1.02, subjects drank 5 ml/kg
water prior to entering the tub. Subjects were instrumented with a sterile
rectal thermistor (YSI Series 400; Yellow Spring Instruments, Yellow
Springs, OH) inserted �10 cm past the anal sphincter (Tre) and a heart
rate monitor chest strap (Polar Electro Inc., Lake Success, NY).
For heat therapy, subjects were immersed up to the shoulder
(except for the arm used for microdialysis experiments) in a 40.5°C
hot tub until Tre reached 38.5°C, which took �25–35 min. Once target
Tre was reached, subjects sat up such that the water reached waist
level for another 60 min, or until the total time of hot water immersion
reached 90 min, whichever came first. While the subject was sitting
up, Tre was maintained between 38.5 and 39.0°C. This heating protocol
was selected because 60 min spent at 38.5°C has been previously shown
to be the most effective passive hyperthermia protocol for inducing
classical markers of heat acclimation (14) and because 38.5°C is consid-
ered to be the threshold temperature required to induce detectable in-
creases in heat shock protein (Hsp) expression (43).
Subjects in the sham group were immersed to the shoulder in a
36°C tub for 30 min and then sat up for another 60 min (90 min total).
This protocol was selected to match hydrostatic pressures experienced
by the heat therapy group. A water temperature of 36°C was selected
to match weighted mean body temperature, ensuring minimal transfer
of heat between the water and subjects. No changes in Tre �0.2°C
were observed in any sham subjects.
Experimental Measures
Prior to and following the 8 wk of heat therapy or thermoneutral
water immersion, subjects reported to the lab having refrained from all
over-the-counter medications, including vitamins and supplements for
24 h, alcohol and caffeine for at least 12 h, food for at least 4 h, and
exercise for at least 24 h. Female subjects provided a negative
pregnancy test prior to studies, measured using urine human chorionic
ganadotropin. Studies were held at the same time of day within
subjects and the poststudy was held at least 48 h after the last water
immersion session to capture the chronic effects of heat therapy.
Female subjects taking hormonal contraceptives (n � 10) were
studied during the active phase. We did not control for menstrual
phase in naturally menstruating females (n � 2), but the phase they
were in was consistent between the pre- and poststudies. Because this
investigation was part of a larger study in which subjects reported to
the lab every 2 wk, it was not possible to always study women under
low hormone conditions. We chose this approach to control for
hormone status across experimental sessions within subjects as best as
possible. Studies were held on separate days from macrovascular
function testing (47), separated by at least 24 h.
Upon arrival at the laboratory, subject height and weight were
obtained. Subjects then rested semisupine, and three microdialysis
fibers [MD2000, 30-kDa cutoff membrane (Bioanalytical Systems,
West Lafeyette, IN) or CMA 31 Linear Probe, 55-kDa cutoff mem-
brane (CMA Microdialysis, Kista, Sweden)] were placed at least 5
cm apart in the ventral skin of the nondominant forearm. Fibers
were introduced with a 25-gauge needle, which was inserted �1
mm below the surface of the skin with entry and exit sites �2.5 cm
apart. Fibers were then threaded through the lumen of the needle
and the needle was removed, leaving the fiber in place under the
skin. Fibers were secured with tape and infused with Lactated
Ringer’s solution at a rate of 2.0 �l/min (CMA 102 Microdialysis
Pump; CMA Microdialysis) until the start of study drugs. Due to
manufacturing issues, we had to switch to a different microdialysis
fiber manufacturer midway through the study. However, each
subject received fibers from the same manufacturer pre- and
poststudy. All drugs delivered have molecular weights well below
the membrane cutoffs, the concentrations of drugs delivered were
high enough to cause maximal inhibition, and the infusion rate was
low enough to allow for equilibration with the tissue. Therefore,
this switch should not have impacted our results.
A period of at least 60 min was allowed for the trauma associated
with needle insertion to subside. During this time, subjects were
instrumented with local heaters (SH02 Skin Heater/Temperature
Monitor; Moor Instruments, Axminster, United Kingdom) over each
microdialysis site. Laser Doppler flowmeter probes (MoorLab; Moor
Instruments) were seated in the center of each local heater, flush with
the skin to measure red blood cell flux, an index of skin blood flow.
A fourth local heater with laser Doppler probe was placed at a fourth
site that did not have a microdialysis fiber. A blood pressure cuff was
placed on the brachium of the opposite arm (Datex Ohmeda Cardio-
Cap; GE Medical Systems, Tampa, FL).
After flux had returned to baseline values, local heaters were set to
33°C and a 5-min baseline was recorded. After this, microdialysis
fibers were randomly assigned to receive: 1) Lactated Ringer’s (sham
site), 2) 10 mM N�-nitro-L-arginine (L-NNA; Sigma-Aldrich, St.
Louis, MO), a nonspecific NO synthase inhibitor, or 3) 10 �M
Tempol (EMD Millipore Chemicals, Billerica, MA), a superoxide
dismutase mimetic, to reduce oxidative stress. All drugs were dis-
solved in Lactated Ringer’s solution. Concentrations of each drug
were selected based on previous studies as the minimum concentra-
tions capable of producing maximal inhibition (33, 34). To confirm
efficacy of this concentration of Tempol, we performed additional
pilot data in subjects with chronic spinal cord injury (SCI), which is
known to be associated with elevated oxidative stress (26) (see
DISCUSSION). Drugs were delivered for 60 min, after which a
second postdrug 5-min baseline was recorded, immediately prior to
the start of local heating.
The local heaters were increased to a temperature of 39°C at a rate
of 0.1°C/s and maintained at this temperature until skin blood flux
reached a stable plateau for at least 5 min, which took �30–45 min.
Once a stable plateau in skin blood flux was reached, the local heaters
were further increased to 43.5°C at a rate of 0.1°C/s and all fibers were
infused with 56 mM sodium nitroprusside (US Pharmacopeia, Rock-
ville, MD) to obtain maximal flux.

 Data Analysis
Data were digitized and recorded to a computer using data acqui-
sition software (Windaq; Dataq Instruments, Akron, OH). The local
heating response was characterized by initial peak, nadir, and plateau.
The initial peak was determined as the highest 30-s period of flux
values occurring within the first 5 min of local heating. Nadir was
determined as the lowest 30-s period of flux values occurring within
5 min following the initial peak. Plateau was averaged over the last 5
min of stable flux values prior to moving on to obtaining maximal
flux. All flux values were then converted to cutaneous vascular
conductance (CVC � flux/mean arterial pressure) and normalized to
a percentage of maximal CVC (% CVCmax). There were no differ-
ences between CVC at the Lactated Ringer’s site and the site which
had no fiber (paired t-test across all 0 wk data: P � 0.49) and so data
were averaged (Control). NO-dependent dilation was calculated as the
difference in normalized plateau CVC between the Control and
L-NNA sites. Tempol-mediated dilation was calculated as the differ-
ence in normalized plateau CVC between the Tempol and Control
sites.
Statistics
Subject demographic data (age, height, weight, BMI) were com-
pared across groups using Student’s unpaired t-test. Mean arterial
blood pressure was compared across groups and across time (0 vs. 8
wk) using two-way mixed design ANOVA with a between factor of
group and a within factor of week.
Effects of the drugs using data pooled across all subjects who
completed 0 wk testing. Data were pooled across 22 subjects who
completed initial (0 wk) testing. Data from two subjects were ex-
cluded due to the same reasons previously described. Changes in
normalized CVC were compared using two-way repeated measures
ANOVA with factors of drug site (Control, L-NNA, and Tempol) and
phase into local heating (baseline, peak, nadir, and plateau). Compar-
isons across paired variables were made with Bonferroni’s post hoc
test. Maximal CVC was compared across drug sites using one-way
repeated measures ANOVA. Pre- to postdrug baseline was compared
at each site using Student’s paired two-tailed t-test.
Effects of the interventions. Changes in normalized CVC at the
Control site (e.g., the normal response) were compared using three-
way mixed design ANOVA with a between factor of group and
within/paired factors of week (0 vs. 8) and phase into local heating
(baseline, peak, nadir, and plateau). Changes in NO-dependent dila-
tion (difference in plateau between Control and L-NNA sites) and
Tempol-mediated dilation (difference in plateau between Control and
Tempol sites) were compared using two-way mixed design ANOVA
with a between factor of group and a within/paired factor of week.
CVCmax was compared using three-way mixed design ANOVA with
between factors of group and drug site and a within factor of week.
For all analyses, when significant main effects or interactions were
detected, comparisons across paired variables (within group) were
made with Bonferroni’s post hoc test, and comparisons across groups
were made using Student’s unpaired two-tailed t-test.
For all analyses, the level of significance was set at � � 0.05.
Demographic data and data characterizing the heat therapy responses
are presented as means � SD. All other data are means � SE.
RESULTS
Subject demographic data are presented in Table 1. Subjects
were well matched across the two groups for sex, age, height,
weight, and BMI (P � 0.64 between groups for all).
Subjects tolerated heat therapy well. There were a few
reports of light-headedness, but these typically only occurred
within the first one to five sessions. Subjects became heat
acclimated across the 8 wk of heat therapy, as indicated by a
reduction in resting Tre (P � 0.004) and an increase in mean
whole body sweat rate (P � 0.001; Table 2). There were no
changes in heart rate across the 8 wk, either prior to entering
the hot tub (P � 0.16) or during heat therapy sessions (P �
0.39). Subjects in the sham group experienced no change in Tre
or heart rate during thermoneutral water immersion sessions
and did not sweat (Table 2).
Local heating of the skin elicited a biphasic vasodilator
response, consisting of an initial peak and plateau with a brief
nadir in between the two phases (Fig. 2). When data were
pooled across all subjects who completed the initial 0 wk
testing (n � 22), average plateau in the Control site was 43 �
3% CVCmax, which is similar to what we have reported
previously (9). There was a significant interaction between
drug site and phase into local heating (P � 0.001). L-NNA
significantly attenuated initial peak, nadir, and plateau com-
pared with both the Control and Tempol sites (P � 0.001 for
all; Fig. 1), such that NO accounted for 78 � 4% of the overall
plateau increase in CVC above baseline. There was no effect of
Tempol on any phase of the local heating response compared
with the Control site (P � 0.53).
Heat therapy significantly improved the local heating re-
sponse (group � week � phase of local heating: P � 0.04).
Within the heat therapy group, initial peak (P � 0.001), nadir
(P � 0.03), and plateau (P � 0.001) were all significantly
elevated after 8 wk of heat therapy, whereas no changes were
observed in the sham group (week � phase within group: P �
0.22; Fig. 3A and Table 3). Heat therapy significantly improved
NO-dependent dilation, the difference between the Control and
L-NNA sites (group � week: P � 0.049; 0 vs. 8 wk within heat

dilation was observed in the sham group (P � 0.93; Fig. 2B).
No changes were observed in Tempol-mediated dilation, the
difference between the Tempol and Control sites, across heat
therapy or thermoneutral water immersion (P � 0.58; Table 3).
CVCmax and Baseline
There were no significant effects of the drugs on CVCmax
within the pooled 0 wk data (P � 0.20; Table 3). Across the
intervention, there was a significant interaction between group,
week, and drug site (P � 0.02), but the only significant
difference in paired variables that was found was the increase
in CVCmax at the Tempol site in the heat therapy group (P �
0.01). L-NNA significantly decreased baseline CVC (P � 0.02),
and Tempol significantly increased baseline CVC (P � 0.03;
Table 4).
DISCUSSION
This is the first study to investigate the molecular mecha-
nisms by which passive heat therapy improves microvascular
function. Our major finding is that passive heat therapy im-
proves cutaneous thermal hyperemia via improved NO bio-
availabilty. We observed no change in NO-dependent dilation
in our sham subjects and no change in the sites receiving
Tempol in either group, demonstrating that the observed find-
ings in the experimental group were due to the heat therapy
intervention through improved NO-dependent dilation.
Local heating of the skin produces a biphasic vasodilator
response, consisting of an initial peak occurring within the first
5 min into heating, and a secondary plateau, which is achieved
after �20–40 min into heating. The initial peak is a sensory
nerve axon reflex which elicits dilation via both NO and
endothelial-derived hyperpolarizing factors (EDHFs) (6, 24,
35), most likely initiated via transient receptor potential vanil-
loid type-1 channels (46) located on the sensory nerves, which
are thought to release calcitonin gene-related peptide and/or
substance P (45). The plateau phase is heavily dependent on
NO (29, 35) and also EDHFs to varying extents, depending on
the temperature used (6, 9).
Heat Therapy
Heat therapy increased all phases of the local heating re-
sponse, indicating improved microvascular function. Further-
more, these effects were NO dependent, because no changes in
the NOS inhibited site were observed. No changes were ob-
served in the sham group, suggesting that improvements in
microvascular function in the heat therapy group were the
result of the heat exposure itself and not due to possible
hemodynamic changes secondary to changes in hydrostatic
pressure or visitation to the lab environment.
We believe the mechanisms behind this adaptation are two-
fold. Heat stress induces elevations in core temperature and

 subsequent increases in blood flow, particularly to the skin.
Elevations in core temperature upregulate expression of heat
shock proteins. In particular, Hsp90 is an essential cofactor for
endothelial NOS (eNOS) (38), meaning that changes in Hsp90
expression can alter eNOS activity and NO production, inde-
pendent of changes in total eNOS protein (18). In the skin,
inhibition of Hsp90 with geldanamycin attenuates thermal
hyperemia (39), indicating Hsp90 is a primary player in the
response. Second, increases in blood flow and shear stress are
essential for cutaneous microvascular adaptation. For example,
chronic localized arm heating in a water bath improves cuta-
neous microvascular function, but these improvements are
prevented when a blood pressure cuff is used on the upper arm
to prevent increases in blood flow above baseline during
heating (16). Shear stress can stimulate NO production via
phosphorylation of eNOS through a few mechanisms, includ-
ing through activating the receptor for vascular endothelial
growth factor 2 (27) and activating phosphoinositide 3-kinase,
which in turn activates protein kinase A and then eNOS (4).
Therefore, not only does heat therapy likely result in increased
association of eNOS with Hsp90, but the pathways necessary
for eNOS activation are also likely upregulated.
Effects of Tempol
In the skin, oxidative stress-mediated impairments in vaso-
dilator responses with primary aging and hypertension can be
reversed by administration of the antioxidant ascorbate (21,
22), and by restoring tetrahydrobiopterin levels (41) or inhib-
iting arginase (20, 22), which breaks down L-arginine, the
substrate necessary for conversion of NO by eNOS, and is
upregulated by oxidative stress. However, the effects of Tem-
pol, which targets oxidative stress more specifically than anti-
oxidants such as ascorbate via its direct effects on superoxide,
have been studied relatively little in the skin, despite being
used extensively in other preparations.
When locally heating the skin to 42°C, Tempol has been
shown to have no effect in young, recreationally active subjects
(33), but to augment the plateau in young smokers (15),
patients with chronic kidney disease (13), and young healthy
subjects following ANG II infusion (a model of vascular
disease) (33), restoring the plateau back to the level of young,
healthy individuals. However, in young, healthy subjects, pla-
teau CVC when heating to 42°C reaches �85–95% of CVCmax, and
so noneffects of Tempol may have been due to a ceiling effect.
Heating to 39°C better isolates the NO component compared
with the more commonly used protocol heating to 42°C
(�80% NO vs. �50–60% NO with rapid local heating to
42°C), and it reaches a plateau of �40–60% CVCmax, allow-
ing for the investigation of interventions which may improve
NO-dependent dilation, such as heat therapy (9). In the present
study, our data show that Tempol also has no effect in young,
sedentary, but otherwise healthy subjects when using this local
heating protocol, either across all subjects pooled at 0 wk or
following heat therapy or thermoneutral water immersion. As
such, this establishes these methods for use in future studies in
patient populations who have elevated oxidative stress in
which heat therapy (or other interventions) may be able to
alleviate oxidative stress-associated impairments in endothelial
function.
To ensure that the noneffects of Tempol were truly because
oxidative stress was minimal in our young, sedentary subjects
and not because the drug did not work in our hands, we studied
two pilot subjects with chronic (7–8 yr postinjury) complete
SCI (lesions at T11 and T12). SCI is associated with elevated
oxidative stress (26), which is likely exacerbated due to in-
creases in circulating ANG II (17), which increases superoxide
production via NADPH oxidase (8). This population was
selected over other patient groups known to have high oxida-
tive stress because they are young (matched to the mean age of
our other subjects) and free of comorbidities which might alter
the effects of Tempol. In the two SCI subjects (data averaged
across the two), plateau reached 53.6% CVCmax in the Control
sites. Tempol increased the plateau in both subjects to an
average of 61.0% CVCmax, confirming the efficacy of this
concentration of Tempol. Additionally, we have previously
studied the effects of Tempol in young smokers in our labo-
ratory using the same techniques and concentration of Tempol
(15). In those subjects, 10 �M Tempol fully reversed impair-
ments in thermal hyperemia.

 Tempol site with heat therapy was statistically significant.
Previous studies from our lab and others (13, 15) have ob-
served no effects of Tempol on CVCmax, and since this effect
was only observed in one site, we do not believe it was due to
heat therapy. More likely, these differences are due to limita-
tions in the laser Doppler flowmetry technique rather than
physiological structural changes in the cutaneous microvascu-
lature. For example, microvessel density can vary greatly from
site to site, highlighting the importance of normalizing laser
Doppler flux values (12).
Conclusions and Perspectives
In the present study, we have demonstrated that passive heat
therapy improves cutaneous microvascular function via im-
proved NO-dependent dilation. While we chose to study a
relatively healthy population for this first study, we believe our
results may be applicable to other clinical conditions. Many
disease states (including a sedentary lifestyle) are characterized
by impaired endothelial function, particularly in the microvas-
culature, and the usual cause is impaired NO bioavailability
secondary to chronic oxidative stress and inflammation. Al-
though exercise is a potent means of improving vascular
function, many patient populations are either unable or unwill-
ing to exercise to an extent necessary for inducing protective
adaptation. Our results demonstrate that passive heat therapy
may offer a powerful alternative for improving microvascular
function and NO bioavailability that could be implemented by
a wide range of patient populations. Given that heat therapy
was capable of inducing improvements in our young, sedentary
subjects, we believe improvements could be even greater in
disease states characterized by greater impairments in vascular
function.
Importantly, we kept the arm used for microdialysis exper-
iments out of the hot tub to better isolate the systemic effects
of heat therapy rather than the effects of chronic elevations in
local skin temperature. By doing so, we believe our results may
better reflect changes that occurred in other microvascular
beds, because the thermal hyperemia response has been shown
to reflect globalized microvascular function (5, 23, 37). How-
ever, it is important to recognize that we observed improved
function in a microvascular bed which experienced large mag-
nitude vasodilation during hot water immersion sessions. Mi-
crovascular beds that do not vasodilate to the same extent
during heat stress (e.g., skeletal muscle) or at all (e.g., renal or
splanchnic circulations) may not have experienced improve-
ments in microvascular function as did the skin. We did show
that forearm postocclusive reactive hyperemia is improved
following 8 wk of heat therapy (47). While forearm reactive
hyperemia is predominantly reflective of microvascular func-
tion in skeletal muscle, it does include a skin component.
Although we did not investigate this in the present study, the
skin under the water (e.g., lower torso and legs) presumably
received an even greater stimulus for adaptation, because it
would have been subject to both the systemic stimuli (e.g.,
elevated core temperature, exposure to circulating factors up-
regulated in the blood, and increased shear stress) and to
elevations in local temperature. Shear stress may have been
even greater in the legs, because vasodilation would likely
have been greater given the combined core temperature eleva-
tion and local skin temperature elevation. As such, heating the
legs may be valuable for improving microvascular health in
patient populations such as spinal cord injured and peripheral
artery disease patients who suffer from a variety of complica-
tions secondary to poor circulation in their legs.
