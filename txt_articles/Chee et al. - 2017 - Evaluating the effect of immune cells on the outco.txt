Background: We systematically assessed the prognostic and predictive value of infiltrating adaptive and innate immune cells in a
large cohort of patients with advanced mesothelioma.
Methods: A tissue microarray from 302 samples was constructed. Markers of adaptive immune response in T-cells (CD8 þ,
FOXP3 þ, CD4 þ, CD45RO þ, CD3 þ) and B-cells (CD20 þ), and of innate immune response; neutrophils (NP57 þ), natural killer cells
(CD56 þ) and macrophages (CD68 þ) were evaluated.
Results: We found that in the epithelioid tumours, high CD4 þ and CD20 þ counts, and low FOXP3 þ, CD68 þ and NP57 þ counts
linked to better outcome. In the non-epithelioid group low CD8 þ and low FOXP3 þ counts were beneficial. On multivariate
analysis low FOXP3 þ remained independently associated with survival in both groups. In the epithelioid group additionally high
CD4 þ, high CD20 þ, and low NP57 þ counts were prognostic.
Conclusions: Our data demonstrate for the first time, in predominately advanced disease, the association of key markers
of adaptive and innate immunity with survival and the differential effect of histology. A better understanding of the
immunological drivers of the different subtypes of mesothelioma will assist prognostication and disease-specific clinical decision-
making.
Mesothelioma is a malignancy most commonly affecting the
pleura, but can also arise in the peritoneum, tunica vaginalis and
pericardium. It is mainly associated with asbestos exposure with a
lag time from exposure to diagnosis of up to 30–40 years
(Scherpereel et al, 2010). There is also a genetic component, with
family clusters of patients who possess BAP1 mutations having an
increased likelihood of developing mesothelioma and uveal
melanoma (Testa et al, 2011).
Mesothelioma incidence is predicted to peak in the United
Kingdom in 2020. Worldwide however, the incidence will continue
to rise as asbestos is still mined and used in industry in many
countries outside of Europe, Australia and the United States. It is
not yet clear if inhalation of carbon nanotubes, increasingly used in
the fields of electronics and medicine, cause similar sequalae as
inhalation of asbestos fibres (Jaurand et al, 2009).
Mesothelioma usually presents late, with diagnosis typically
made by a combination of radiological findings and pleural biopsy/
pleural fluid cytology. The median survival following a diagnosis of
mesothelioma is 4–18 months despite treatments like chemother-
apy, radiotherapy and surgery.

 Asbestos-associated pleural mesothelioma results from chronic
inflammation, due to the body’s inability to deal with a foreign
antigen in the form of inhaled asbestos fibres. Three histological
subtypes of mesothelioma are recognised. Epithelioid mesothe-
lioma carries the best prognosis, sarcomatoid mesothelioma is the
most aggressive and tumours with mixed morphology have
intermediate outcomes.
The role of the immune system in cancer is well established and
is critically involved in immunoediting and surveillance; tumour
progression results from immune escape (Dunn et al, 2004;
Schreiber et al, 2011). In many solid tumours, including colorectal,
lung, breast and oropharyngeal, tumour infiltrating lymphocytes
(TILs) confer a survival benefit (Galon et al, 2006; Al Shibli et al,
2008; Gooden et al, 2011; Garcı
´a-Martı
´nez et al, 2014; Ward et al,
2014). A meta-analysis of 23 studies of solid tumours demon-
strated the presence of CD8 þ
TILs conferred a prognostic
advantage and a similar analysis of six studies of CD4 þ TILs
showed a significant effect on overall survival (Gooden et al, 2011).
A more recent meta-analysis of nearly 18 000 tumours in 39
cancers found higher levels of T-cell fractions to be generally
associated with better survival (Gentles et al, 2015).
In mesothelioma, the impact of TIL density is less clear.
Previous small surgical studies have suggested that tumour CD8 þ
T-cell infiltration is associated with better survival (Anraku et al,
2008; Yamada et al, 2010). More recently, a larger series
demonstrated tumour CD4 þ T-cell infiltration confers a survival
advantage in epithelioid mesothelioma (Uijie et al, 2015). These
three cohorts consisted mainly of patients who were fit enough to
undergo surgical resection.
The link between T-cell density in the tumour and outcome for
advanced disease is not resolved. In the study presented here we
sought to characterise the link between morphological density of
immune cells in mesothelioma and outcome in a predominately
treatment naı
¨ve cohort. We undertook an assessment of innate and
adaptive immune cells in a cohort of 302 patients from a large UK
centre, using immunohistochemical evaluation of immune cells.
Establishing which immune cells are associated with clinical
outcome may also have a bearing on the evaluation of response to
treatments such as chemotherapy and immunotherapy. Immu-
notherapy trials in mesothelioma are underway with checkpoint
inhibitors such as tremelimumab targeting CTLA4 or pembroli-
zumab directed against PD-1 (Calabro
` et al, 2013; Alley et al,
2017). Similarly, targeting WT1 (Zauderer, 2010) and mesothelin
(Kelly et al, 2012; Hassan et al, 2015) by vaccination or CAR
(Rosenberg, 2012) therapies is an area of intense interest. To date,
the factors that are associated with treatment success are not yet
fully
understood.
Where
data
regarding
chemotherapy
was
available, we evaluated whether particular immune cells were
associated with treatment success.
MATERIALS AND METHODS
Case selection. Ethical approval for this study (NRES South-
ampton and South West Hampshire LREC 10/H0504/32) was in
place at our institution.
Patients included in the cohort had a pathological diagnosis of
mesothelioma dated at least 2 years prior to analysis. A total of 302
consecutive formalin fixed paraffin embedded tissue blocks
archived between 2004 and 2012 were assessed by haematoxylin-
eosin staining to ensure they contained sufficient tissue for further
immunohistochemical evaluation. A tissue microarray (TMA) was
generated from this cohort. Some cases could not be evaluated as
there was tissue loss in the formation of the TMA. Cases were
included in the analysis if at least three high-powered fields were
available. A subcohort of B170 cases was evaluated for CD3 þ
T-cells and CD56 þ natural killer cells. All samples were taken at
the time of diagnostic biopsy or surgical intervention when no
systemic treatment had been given.
Clinical data were collected from patient records. Where
survival data were not available locally, the date and cause of
death was retrieved from the national cancer registry (Public
Health England) following a formal data-access application.
Post diagnosis treatment data were available from 166 patients.
Of these 61 (37%) underwent chemotherapy and 105 (63%) did
not. Treatment data were not available for 136 patients who had
been referred to our centre for diagnostic procedures but were then
managed at other sites (Table 1).
Of the 302 patients, 259 (86%) underwent palliative symptom
management with thoracoscopy and pleural biopsy followed by talc
pleurodesis; and 7 (2%) underwent image guided pleural biopsy.
Thirty-six (12%) underwent a radical surgical approach including
decortication/pleurectomy/pleuro-pneumonectomy (Table 1).
Patients were excluded from the analysis based on the following
criteria: tissue loss resulting in availability of less than three high-
powered fields, unavailability of survival data, death within 30 days
of biopsy, lack of treatment data in the post diagnosis treatment
group and an undefined histological morphology.
Histopathological analysis–tissue microarray. Tumour histology
was re-reviewed by pathologists GJT, KAM and SG. Haematoxylin-
eosin stained slides from all available cases were assessed and three
representative areas of tumour selected.
Triplicate 1 mm cores were taken from the corresponding
formalin fixed paraffin embedded tissue block using a semi-
automated system (Aphelys Minicore 2, Mitogen, Harpenden, UK)
to generate a TMA. TMA sections (4 mm) were used for
haematoxylin-eosin and immunohistochemical staining.

 Immunohistochemistry was performed using an automated
platform (Dako Autostainer) in a CPA-accredited clinical cellular
pathology department using antibodies optimised to national
diagnostic standards (NEQAS). The antibodies used were anti-
human CD3 1:200 (clone F7.2.38; Dako, Carpinteria, CA, USA),
anti-human CD4 1:50 (clone 4B, Dako), CD8 RTU (Clone C8/14
4B, Dako), CD20 1:250 (Clone L26, Dako), CD45RO 1:2500 (Clone
UCHL-1, Dako), CD56 RTU (Clone 123C3, Dako), NP57 1:100
(Dako), CD68 RTU (Clone PG-M1, Dako), Wilms Tumour 1 RTU
(Clone 6F-H2, Dako), FoxP3 1:100 (Clone 236A/E7, Abcam,
Cambridge, UK).
Triplicate random high-power fields ( � 400) were counted
manually per core across three cores on the Olympus dotSlide
(SC). The average of 3–9 counts per patient was calculated to allow
for intra-tumoural heterogeneity. The variability in the number of
counts per patient relates to the number of viable cores present on
the TMA.
The mean of each antibody count was taken as the cutoff point
between high and low counts. Representative high and low T-cell
densities are shown in Figure 1.
Statistical analysis. Statistical analyses were performed using SPSS
Version 22 (IBM Corp. Released 2013. IBM SPSS Statistics for
Windows, Version 22.0, IBM Corp., Armonk, NY, USA). Survival
time was measured from the time of diagnosis to the time of death.
Patients for whom the date of death was unknown were censored
from the survival analyses. Kaplan–Meier plots with log-rank tests,
univariate and multivariate Cox proportional hazard models were
used to analyse the survival data. Separate subtype models were
fitted due to the presence of interactions between subtype and
several of the immune markers analysed. A P-value of o0.05 was
considered significant.
Our cohort was divided into epithelioid and non-epithelioid
(biphasic
and
sarcomatoid)
mesothelioma
subtypes
for
the
purposes of analysis as there were only 41 cases of sarcomatoid
mesothelioma.
RESULTS
Clinical and demographic characteristics of our patient cohort are
shown in Table 1. The median age was 72 (41–90) years, 81% of
the patients were men. Of the 302 tumours, 172 were classified as
epithelioid (57%), 82 as biphasic (27%) and 41 as sarcomatoid
(14%) subtypes. Seven cases (2%) had an undefined morphology.
The median follow-up was 278 days (9.3 months) and the
minimum follow-up time was 30 days. There were 293 deaths from
mesothelioma
over
the
study
period.
Survival
analysis
by
histological subtype was consistent with published data. The
median overall survival for epithelioid mesothelioma in our cohort
was 342 days (11.4 months) (95% CI 277–406 days) and for non-
epithelioid mesothelioma was 205 days (6.8 months) (95% CI 146–
260 days) (Table 1).
The adaptive immune response, particularly involving cytotoxic
T-cells, has been shown to influence the prognosis of many tumour
types. We examined expression of markers for cytotoxic T-cells
(CD8 þ), regulatory T-cells (FOXP3 þ), helper T-cells (CD4 þ),
memory
T-cells
(CD45RO þ),
T-cells
(CD3 þ)
and
B-cells
(CD20 þ) in the epithelioid and non-epithelioid subtypes.
The mean count/high-power field was used to define the cut
point between high and low values per marker evaluated. Median
overall survival with 95% confidence interval and P-values for the
epithelioid and non-epithelioid groups are shown in Table 2.
In the epithelioid group, we found that high CD4 þ (P ¼ 0.005),
low FOXP3 þ (P ¼ 0.024) and high CD20 þ counts (P ¼ 0.008)
were associated with a better outcome. The relevant Kaplan–Meier
curves are shown in Figure 2A–C. These markers were associated
with a longer overall survival of 7, 3 and 7 months respectively
compared to the CD4 þ low, FOXP3 þ high and CD20 þ low
groups. CD8 þ T-cell counts were not associated with survival in
the epithelioid group (P ¼ 0.983).
In the non-epithelioid group, positive prognostic markers were
low CD8 þ (P ¼ 0.019) and low FOXP3 þ (P ¼ 0.012) T-cell
counts. Kaplan–Meier curves are shown in Figure 3A and B. Both
markers were associated with a 4-month longer overall survival in
the non-epithelioid group compared to the CD8 þ high and
FOXP3 þ high groups.
The tumour microenvironment also contains innate immune
cells and we evaluated the expression of markers of neutrophils
(NP57 þ),
natural
killer
cells
(CD56 þ)
and
macrophages
(CD68 þ).
In the epithelioid group, we found the positive predictors of
outcome from innate immune cells were low CD68 þ (P ¼ 0.026)
and low NP57 þ (P ¼ 0.006) counts. Kaplan–Meier curves are
shown in Supplementary Figure 1A and B. These markers were
both associated with a 3-month longer overall survival in the
epithelioid group compared to the CD68 þ high and NP57 þ high
groups. In the non-epithelioid group, none of the markers of innate
immunity tested were significantly associated with survival.
Wilms tumour 1 (WT1) is expressed in most cases of
mesothelioma. Expression was not associated with differential
survival in either morphology in our data set.
Multivariate
analysis
was
performed
next
based
on
the
parameters that were significant on univariate analysis. In the
epithelioid group, a high CD4 þ
(P ¼ 0.003), high CD20 þ
(P ¼ 0.010),
low
FOXP3 þ
(P ¼ 0.000414)
and
low
NP57 þ
(P ¼ 0.038) counts remained significantly associated with survival.
In the non-epithelioid group, a low number of FOXP3 þ cells
associated with survival, P ¼ 0.043. The data for the multivariate
analysis of both groups is shown in Table 3.
The ratio of CD4 þ/CD8 þ with a cut point of 1 between low
and high counts was analysed. A ratio of 41 was associated with
longer survival only in the epithelioid group, 99 low, 59 high (158
total) P ¼ 0.047. Kaplan–Meier curves are shown in Supplementary
Figure 2A and B.
Of 166 patients managed in our own centre, 61 had received
chemotherapy. These 61 chemotherapy-treated patients had a
significantly better survival than those who were not given
chemotherapy (Po0.0001), likely reflecting both patient selection
and
effect
of
treatment.
In
the
61
patients
treated
with
chemotherapy, a high CD4 þ count identified patients who lived
longer (P ¼ 0.034); no effect was seen for CD8 þ T-cells.

 high CD20 þ, low FOXP3 þ counts were independent prognostic
factors (P ¼ 0.001, P ¼ 0.005, P ¼ 0.015, P ¼ 0.046) in multivariate
analysis. In the group of 72 non-epithelioid cases, 19 patients had
been treated with chemotherapy; only chemotherapy administra-
tion was independently associated with survival (P ¼ 0.029).
DISCUSSION
We have evaluated a large unselected cohort of patients for
evidence of whether immune attack occurs in mesothelioma and
how this might affect survival. To our knowledge, this is the largest
cohort of mesothelioma containing all subtypes analysed to date.
Our data represent a patient population in whom treatment was
given with palliative intent from the outset (88%). Only 37% of the
cohort received palliative chemotherapy and our cohort is clinically
distinct from published data sets that have evaluated TIL density in
mesothelioma to date and where the focus has been on operable
disease (Anraku et al, 2008; Yamada et al, 2010; Uijie et al, 2015).
We studied markers of adaptive (CD3 þ, CD4 þ, CD8 þ, T
regulatory, T memory and B-cells) and innate immunity (macro-
phages, natural killer cells and neutrophils). Epithelioid and

Evaluating immunity in mesothelioma

 non-epithelioid mesothelioma are clinically distinct diseases, and
our data demonstrate they are immunologically different also;
adaptive immune cell infiltrates differentially link to outcome
between subtypes.
A limitation to this study is the analysis is based on staining
small
biopsy
specimens
in
the
TMA
which
may
not
be
representative of the whole tumour. This is important as
mesothelioma has been shown to be polyclonal in origin
(Comertpay et al, 2014). We attempted to correct for inter-
tumoural heterogeneity by taking three cores across the tumour
and 3–9 counts per patient.
Unexpectedly, high CD8 þ density appears not to be beneficial
for survival in mesothelioma patients. In the epithelioid group the
CD8 þ T-cell density was indifferent for outcome; in the non-
epithelioid group, a low number of CD8 þ T-cells linked with a
survival advantage, although this observation was not maintained
in the multivariate analysis. This is in contrast to observations in
many other solid cancers where a high density of CD8 þ TILs has
been shown to confer a survival advantage (Galon et al, 2006; Al
Shibli et al, 2008; Gooden et al, 2011; Garcı
´a-Martı
´nez et al 2014;
Ward et al, 2014). Published data suggest that non-epithelioid
mesothelioma is more likely to be PD-L1 positive and to have a
higher proportion of proliferating CD8 þ T-cells (Awad et al,
2016). This suggests that in our data the presence of CD8 þ T-cells
is also likely to be associated with high PD-L1 expression. It is
unclear whether such PDL1 expression in the tumour cells is in
part or even mostly a reflection of immune attack via IFN
signalling from immune cells (and therefore reflects immunogeni-
city of the cancer tissue) or conversely whether PDL1 expression
might be driven by another pathway in mesothelioma, with only
deleterious effects on T-cell responses.
A high density of CD4 þ TILs conferred a survival advantage in
the epithelioid group, both on univariate and multivariate analysis.
CD4 þ T-cells are important for activating a range of tumour-
reactive immune cells including CD8 þ T-cells and B-cells (Ding
et al, 2010). Further work to establish the targets of CD4 þ T-cell
recognition is needed to better understand the balance of effector
and regulatory CD4 þ T-cells in mesothelioma. This would then
also allow a linkage to mutational status and immune attack and
targeting of such mutations, for example by vaccination.
A key CD4 þ T-cell population that limits the function of
effector and helper T-cells are FOXP3 þCD4 þ regulatory T-cells.
Consistent with the current understanding of their role, we observe
that a high number of FOXP3 þ T-cells was significantly associated
with
poorer
survival
in
both
morphological
subgroups
of
mesothelioma. The effect of FOXP3 þ T-reg likely has disease-
specific features. While in many solid tumour types a lower T-reg
density is good for the patient (Shang et al, 2015), there are some
exceptions, such as head and neck squamous cell carcinoma, where
higher FOXP3 þ T-cell density is linked to better locoregional
control (Badoual et al, 2006). It may simply be though that this
apparent contradiction reflects a parallel influx of protective and
suppressive immune cells, as in head and neck cancer where
globally the number of immune cells is tightly linked to survival
(Ward et al, 2014; Wood et al, 2016).
We evaluated, whether the sensitivity of quantification of the
immune cell infiltrate could be improved by assessing the relative
density of CD4 þ and CD8 þ T-cells. An easy way of expressing
this is by calculating the ratio of CD4 þ/CD8 þ T-cells, a measure
that then becomes independent of the absolute abundance of the
T-cells in the tissue. A high CD4 þ/CD8 þ
ratio has been
previously evaluated in different types of cancer and was found
to be associated with a good outcome in cervical squamous cell
carcinoma and a poor outcome in colorectal cancer (Diederichsen
et al, 2003; Shah et al, 2011). In our cohort, a CD4 þ/CD8 þ ratio
of greater than 1 was associated with better survival in the overall
and epithelioid groups and this parameter warrants further analysis
in other cancers to determine if it might be a useful prognostic
marker for survival.
There is increasing recognition of the important role B-cells play
in adaptive immune attack in the tumour microenvironment.
Tumour-associated B-cells induce and regulate T-cell immune
responses through antigen presentation and CD4 þ T-cell activa-
tion, contributing to the differentiation of CD4 þ T-cells and
polarisation of Th1 and Th2 subsets (Lund and Randall, 2010;
Baumgarth, 2011; Bao et al 2014). In our cohort, a high density of
CD20 þ in the epithelioid group was associated with better
survival. This remained significant on multivariate analysis and
our data are consistent with Ujiie et al (2015). Similar to T-cells,
there is variation in the prognostic effect of B-cell infiltration
between tumour types. In colorectal cancer, an increased B-cell
gene expression was significantly associated with survival (Bindea
et al, 2013). Our own data in head and neck squamous cell
carcinoma has demonstrated a high B-cell infiltrate to be
associated with better outcome (Wood et al, 2016). It is unclear
however what the B-cells might contribute immunologically, and
whether are simply drawn to the tumour in response to cytokine
stimulation.
Tumour-associated inflammation is recognised as a key hall-
mark of cancer (Grivennikov et al, 2010; Hanahan and Weinberg,
2011) and innate immune cells such as macrophages and
neutrophils form an important and complex part of the tumour
microenvironment. Tumour-associated macrophages can adopt a
pro-tumourigenic role by promotion of angiogenesis and metas-
tases and preventing T-cell attack on tumour cells and once the
tumour is established, the macrophages are polarised to a pro-
tumour phenotype (Noy and Pollard, 2014). In our cohort, a low
CD68 þ count was significant in the epithelioid group, similar to
findings by Ujiie et al (2015), but not in the non-epithelioid group.
The
association
of
a
low
infiltration
of
tumour-associated
macrophages and survival is consistent with the theory of chronic
asbestos-induced
inflammation
driving
the
development
of
mesothelioma in a process of ‘frustrated phagocytosis’ (Bograd
et al, 2011).
Tumour-associated neutrophils similarly can adopt a pro-
tumourigenic role by involvement in angiogenesis and creating a
pro-invasive and pro-metastatic environment and may also
play an anti-tumourigenic role (Hanahan and Coussens, 2012).
Consistent with this, in our cohort, a low number of NP57 cells
were associated with better survival in the epithelioid group. To
our knowledge, our group is the first to detect the prognostic
value of a low neutrophil count on survival in epithelioid
mesothelioma.

mixed types, markers that predict response to treatment in

 mesothelioma are lacking. In other solid tumours such as breast,
rectal and oesophageal cancer immunological features that predict
for
pathological
complete
response
and
survival
following
chemotherapy have been examined. In a breast cancer cohort, a
pre-treatment high CD4 þ/CD8 þ
ratio was an independent
predictor of pathological complete response after neo-adjuvant
chemotherapy and was associated with better prognosis (Garcı
´a-
Martı
´nez et al, 2014) as was the presence of CD20 þ B-cells (Brown
et al, 2014). We therefore wondered if TIL density would link to
treatment response in mesothelioma. We found that this was the
case: in 61 patients who had received chemotherapy CD4 þ T-cell
high cases identified patients who had a better outcome. This
remained true also if only the 42 patients with epithelioid histology
and who received chemotherapy were considered and suggest that
CD4 þ T-cells may also have a predictive value in mesothelioma.
In summary, our data demonstrate for the first time an
association of survival with high CD4 þ, low FOXP3 þ, high
CD20 þ, low NP57 þ and low CD68 þ counts in epithelioid
mesothelioma, treated with palliative intent. Low CD8 þ and low
FOXP3 þ T-cell densities emerge as prognostic in non-epithelioid
mesothelioma.
Given
that
epithelioid
and
non-epithelioid
mesothelioma behave very differently clinically, the underpinning
differences in potential immunological drivers of the different
subtypes are intriguing and warrant further study and will benefit
from mapping onto the emerging stratifiers using genomic analyses
(Bueno et al, 2016). Emerging data suggesting that sarcomatoid
mesothelioma may be more responsive to immunotherapy than the
epithelioid subtype (Mansfield et al, 2014; Cedre
´s et al, 2015), but
more work is needed to understand the reason behind this
difference. Our data illustrate that the morphological differences,
linked to outcome also find their reflection in the adaptive and
innate immune events that are present in the cancer. Their
functional understanding will open the door towards rational
targeting of immune pathways to improve the outcomes of patients
with this devastating disease.
