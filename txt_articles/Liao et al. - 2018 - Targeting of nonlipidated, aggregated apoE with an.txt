Introduction
Alzheimer disease (AD) is the most common form of dementia and 
it affects more than 5 million people in the United States (www.alz.
org). Compelling evidence has shown that amyloid β (Aβ) plays a 
key role in the pathogenesis of AD (1, 2). In autosomal dominant 
AD, missense mutations in amyloid precursor protein (APP) or 
components of the γ- secretase complex presenilin 1 (PS1) or pre-
senilin 2 (PS2) result in early onset amyloid deposition in the brain 
due to a relative increase in production of longer Aβ species such 
as Aβ42, an increase in all Aβ species, or an alteration of Aβ aggre-
gation propensity and clearance (3). Also, a protective mutation in 
AD was recently described near the N-terminus of the β secretase 
site in APP that results in decreased Aβ production (4).
The majority of AD cases are known as late-onset AD (LOAD), 
which clinically begins after the age of 65. The apolipoprotein E 
(APOE) gene is the strongest genetic risk factor for LOAD. In 
humans, the 3 common isoforms of apoE — E2, E3, and E4 — are 
encoded by a 299 amino acid protein. Compared with the most 
common form of apoE, apoE3 (Cys112, Arg158), each allele of 
apoE4 (Arg112, Arg158) strongly increase the risk for AD (~3.7-fold 
for one E4 allele and ~12-fold for 2 E4 alleles relative to the E3/
E3 genotype); in contrast, apoE2 (Cys112, Cys158) is protective for 
AD (5, 6). How apoE impacts AD pathogenesis is not entirely clear; 
however, evidence shows that apoE influences Aβ aggregation and 
clearance (7) and is also found in amyloid plaques (8, 9).
Previously, our group has shown that passive immuno-
therapy using HJ6.3, an antibody targeting endogenous murine 
apoE, strongly suppresses Aβ pathology in the APPswe/PS1ΔE9 
mouse brain when treatment is started prior to plaque onset 
(10). When administered after plaque onset, HJ6.3 reduced 
brain Aβ plaque load, restored resting-state functional connec-
tivity, and mildly improved spatial performance in the water 
maze (11). However, in order to further explore whether such 
an approach could potentially translate into an immunothera-
py for humans, studies with apoE antibodies targeting human 
apoE in animals expressing human Aβ and apoE are critical. It 
is also important to understand the mechanism(s) underlying 
the therapeutic effects.
The apolipoprotein E E4 allele of the APOE gene is the strongest genetic factor for late-onset Alzheimer disease (LOAD). There 
is compelling evidence that apoE influences Alzheimer disease (AD) in large part by affecting amyloid β (Aβ) aggregation and 
clearance; however, the molecular mechanism underlying these findings remains largely unknown. Herein, we tested whether 
anti–human apoE antibodies can decrease Aβ pathology in mice producing both human Aβ and apoE4, and investigated the 
mechanism underlying these effects. We utilized APPPS1-21 mice crossed to apoE4-knockin mice expressing human apoE4 
(APPPS1-21/APOE4). We discovered an anti–human apoE antibody, anti–human apoE 4 (HAE-4), that specifically recognizes 
human apoE4 and apoE3 and preferentially binds nonlipidated, aggregated apoE over the lipidated apoE found in circulation. 
HAE-4 also binds to apoE in amyloid plaques in unfixed brain sections and in living APPPS1-21/APOE4 mice. When delivered 
centrally or by peripheral injection, HAE-4 reduced Aβ deposition in APPPS1-21/APOE4 mice. Using adeno-associated 
virus to express 2 different full-length anti–apoE antibodies in the brain, we found that HAE antibodies decreased amyloid 
accumulation, which was dependent on Fcγ receptor function. These data support the hypothesis that a primary mechanism 
for apoE-mediated plaque formation may be a result of apoE aggregation, as preferentially targeting apoE aggregates with 
therapeutic antibodies reduces Aβ pathology and may represent a selective approach to treat AD.
Targeting of nonlipidated, aggregated apoE with 
antibodies inhibits amyloid accumulation

no appreciable binding to apoE2 (Figure 1D). 
HAE-1 was apoE4-specific (Figure 1A). Using 
surface plasmon resonance (SPR) (Figure 1, 
E–G), the apparent KD values were determined 
for HAE-1 (6.02 × 10–8 M), HAE-2 (3.19 × 10–10 
M), and HAE-4 (1.98 × 10–7 M) for their inter-
action with recombinant apoE4 (Table 1). 
The KD value for HAE-3 was not determined 
because it showed binding characteristics 
similar to those of HAE-2 in ELISA (Figure 1, 
B and C). Oddly, the maximum response units 
for HAE-1 and HAE-4 as measured by SPR 
were only 10% of the maximum value seen for 
HAE-2, despite greater apoE4 capture levels 
for experiments with HAE-1 and HAE-4. This 
suggested the possibility that these 2 antibod-
ies were recognizing a minor fraction of the 
immobilized apoE, a hypothesis that was later 
validated (see below).
Effects of intracerebroventricularly admin-
istered anti–apoE antibodies on Aβ pathology 
in APPPS1-21/APOE4 mice. apoE is present in 
Aβ-containing amyloid plaques in both human 
AD as well as in mouse models of amyloidosis 
(8, 9, 14). To test whether HAE antibodies are 
able to decrease Aβ pathology in APPPS1-21/APOE4 mice, we 
directly infused the antibodies into the lateral ventricle of the mice 
before plaque onset, starting at the age of 2 months. Antibodies 
were infused continuously (0.3 μg/h) via an osmotic pump for 6 
weeks and mice were assessed at the age of 3.5 months (females, 
n = 10–11 per group). Infusions of PBS or a control mouse IgG2ab 
into the mouse brain were included as negative controls, and anti–
Aβ antibody HJ5.1 (15) was used as a positive control. Aβ plaques 
were stained using anti–Aβ antibody HJ3.4 (Supplemental Fig-
ure 1A; supplemental material available online with this article; 
In the present study, we tested the effects of anti–human apoE 
(HAE) antibodies, a new series of apoE antibodies targeting human 
apoE, on Aβ pathology in APPPS1-21/APOE4-knockin (KI) mice. 
These mice were generated by crossing human apoE4-KI mice 
expressing human apoE4 under the control of endogenous murine 
apoE regulatory elements (APOE4) (12) to line APPPS1-21 (13). We 
found that HAE-4, an antibody specific for apoE3 and apoE4, was 
able to reduce Aβ deposition when infused directly into the brain, 
delivered by i.p. injection starting at the time of plaque onset, or 
expressed in the brain via adeno-associated virus–mediated (AAV–
mediated) delivery. Here we present in detail the features of anti-
body HAE-4 that facilitate its ability to decrease Aβ deposition and 
propose a likely mechanism of action.
Results
Characterization of the HAE series of apoE antibodies using recom-
binant human apoE. We used a direct ELISA to test whether the 
HAE series of apoE antibodies binds to different recombinant 
apoE isoforms (Figure 1, A–D). HAE-2 and HAE-3 recognized 
all 3 isoforms of human apoE (Figure 1, B and C), whereas 
HAE-4 had much higher affinity for apoE3 and apoE4 with

load in APPPS1-21/APOE4 mice, we tested whether peripheral 
administration of HAE-1 and HAE-4 could impact Aβ pathology 
in these mice. Beginning at the age of 2 months, APPPS1-21/
APOE4 mice (females, n = 10–13 per group) were treated weekly 
with i.p. injections (50 mg/kg body weight) of antibodies until 
3.5 months of age. A group of untreated mice were harvested at 
2 months to determine baseline Aβ pathology. As determined 
by Aβ immunostaining, HAE-4 significantly reduced Aβ plaque 
load compared with the mouse IgG2ab control (Figure 2, A and 
B). X-34 staining suggested that HAE-4 also reduced fibrillar 
plaque load, but the effect was not significant (Figure 2, A and 
C). However, HAE-4 significantly reduced insoluble Aβ40 (Fig-
ure 2D) and Aβ42 (Figure 2E) in the guanidine fraction of the 
cerebral cortex, as compared with both the PBS- and IgG2ab-
treated control groups at the same age. There were no signifi-

stained using Thioflavin S (Supplemental Figure 1B). The corti-
cal tissue was extracted sequentially in PBS (soluble), 1% Triton 
X-100, and 5 M guanidine HCl (insoluble). Levels of insoluble 
Aβ40 and Aβ42 were determined by ELISA (Supplemental Figure 1, 
C and D). HJ5.1 (anti-Aβ) and the anti–apoE antibodies HAE-1 and 
HAE-4 significantly reduced Aβ plaque load compared with a con-
trol mouse IgG2ab (Supplemental Figure 1A). HAE-4 also signifi-
cantly reduced Aβ plaque load compared with PBS (Supplemental 
Figure 1A). Some of the antibodies tended to decrease fibrillar Aβ 
and insoluble Aβ40 and Aβ42, but the effects were not statistically 
significant (Supplemental Figure 1, B–D).

animals, we performed a dose-response study with HAE-4. At 
2 months of age, the mice (mixed sexual phenotype, n = 17–18/
group) received weekly i.p. injections of control IgG2ab (50 mg/
kg), anti–Aβ antibody HJ3.4, which recognizes amyloid plaques 
(50 mg/kg), or HAE-4 (2, 10, and 50 mg/kg) for 2.5 months 
prior to sacrifice. There was a significant dose-dependent effect 
of HAE-4 on reducing insoluble Aβ40 and Aβ42 levels in the brain 
(Supplemental Figure 4).
Binding profile of HAE antibodies to lipidated apoE. Given that 
the antibodies were chronically injected into the peripheral com-
partment at high levels, we were somewhat surprised that HAE-1 
 
and HAE-4 did not affect levels of plasma apoE or brain apoE, 
as apoE is abundant in both locations. This prompted us to ask 
whether some of the anti–apoE antibodies bound differentially 
to lipidated apoE versus other forms of the protein. In order to 
assess binding to lipidated apoE, we characterized the binding of 
HAE antibodies to plasma-derived apoE, the majority of which is 
lipidated. Plasma that contained intact plasma lipoproteins from 
apoE-KO (EKO), APOE2-, APOE3-, and APOE4-KI mice was 
cant changes in levels of brain apoE, plasma apoE, or plasma Aβ 
after HAE-1 or HAE-4 treatment relative to the control groups 
at the same age (Supplemental Figure 2). A possible reason that 
the i.p. injection of 50 mg/kg HAE-4 had a somewhat greater 
effect on reducing Aβ levels than the results obtained with 
chronic i.c.v. infusion (Supplemental Figure 1) is that the con-
centration of HAE-4 in the brain after 6 weeks of treatment was 
significantly higher with the i.p. injection paradigm (6.37 ± 2.05 
ng/100 mg tissue, n = 13) than the i.c.v. infusion paradigm (2.16 
± 0.7 ng/100 mg tissue, n = 9) (P = 0.001). Unlike HAE-4, HAE-
1 had no significant effect on lowering Aβ levels. This may be 
due to the fact that HAE-1 is an IgG1 antibody whereas HAE-
4 is an IgG2ab antibody. Mouse IgG1 antibodies bind poorly to 
FcγR1 receptors (16). In a separate experiment performed under 
the same conditions, HAE-3 did not change the Aβ plaque load, 
fibrillar plaque load, or insoluble Aβ in the brain compared with 
PBS-treated mice (Supplemental Figure 3). This is likely due 
to the very short half-life of HAE-3 in the blood following i.p. 
injection (see below). In another cohort of APPPS1-21/APOE4

tification of dosed antibodies in plasma was by antigen-capture ELISA using coated recombinant apoE4 to detect HAE-4, with recombinant Her2 used to 
detect the control IgG.

In contrast, plasma did not inhibit the binding of HAE-1 or HAE-
4, suggesting that these antibodies do not bind lipidated forms of 
apoE (Figure 3E).
The difference in ability to recognize plasma-derived apoE 
was further supported by the pharmacokinetic profiles of HAE-1, 
HAE-2, HAE-3, and HAE-4. Following i.p. injection (10 mg/kg) 
into APOE4 mice, HAE-2 and HAE-3 were rapidly cleared from 
plasma within 4 hours (Supplemental Figure 5), whereas HAE-4 
was present in the plasma 14 days after injection at levels similar 
to a control mouse IgG2a antibody (Figure 3F). The likely target-
mediated clearance observed with HAE-2 and HAE-3 suggests that 
these antibodies bind to plasma-derived lipidated apoE, which is 
abundant in the plasma (~50 μg/ml), whereas HAE-1 and HAE-4 
do not. HAE-1 and HAE-4 appear to be selective for nonlipidated 
apoE, which is low or absent in plasma.
Binding of HAE-4 to plaque and aggregated apoE. Using unfixed 
frozen brain sections from APPPS1-21/APOE4 or APPPS1-21/
EKO mice, we evaluated whether HAE-1 and HAE-4 could rec-
ognize apoE in the brain (Figure 4A). The presence of Aβ plaques 
was confirmed with Aβ immunostaining using anti–Aβ antibody 
HJ3.4 on sections from the same brain. Given the lower total sig-
nal seen by SPR for HAE-1 and HAE-4 compared with HAE-2 (Fig-
coated on ELISA plates. Chimeric anti–apoE antibodies HAE-2 
(chi–HAE-2) and HAE-4 (chi–HAE-4), which consist of mouse 
variable regions fused to human constant regions, were added 
to the plasma-coated plates, and bound chi–HAE-2 or chi–HAE-4 
was detected using anti–human IgG. Chi–HAE-2 bound to plasma 
containing lipidated apoE2, apoE3, and apoE4 (Figure 3A). In 
contrast, chi–HAE-4 did not bind strongly to plasma containing 
lipidated apoE2, apoE3, and apoE4 (Figure 3B). To rule out that 
the coating of apoE from plasma onto plates alters its conforma-
tion and its possible detection by the apoE antibodies, we then 
performed a sandwich ELISA by coating HAE-2 or HAE-4 onto 
the plates, incubating with plasma from EKO, APOE2, APOE3, 
and APOE4 mice, and detecting with a polyclonal anti–apoE anti-
body. Lipidated apoE2, apoE3, and apoE4 in the respective plasma 
samples was captured by HAE-2 (Figure 3C) but not HAE-4 (Fig-
ure 3D). Next, we tested the ability of plasma to inhibit the bind-
ing of HAE-1, HAE-2, and HAE-4 to immobilized recombinant 
nonlipidated apoE4. Antibodies were preincubated with serially 
diluted plasma from APOE4 mice and subsequently added to the 
recombinant apoE4-coated plate. The results showed that plasma 
inhibited the binding of HAE-2 to immobilized apoE4, suggesting 
that HAE-2 bound both lipidated and nonlipidated forms of apoE.

ure 1, E–G), we hypothesized that HAE-1 and HAE-4 bound to a 
less-abundant subspecies of the recombinant apoE4 that had been 
immobilized on the sensor chip. To assess whether HAE-4 binds 
to aggregated forms of apoE, we compared the binding of HAE-1, 
 
HAE-2, or HAE-4 to untreated apoE4 or apoE4 preincubated 
overnight at 40°C. HAE-2 bound to both forms of apoE similarly, 
whereas the binding of HAE-1 and HAE-4 to heat-treated apoE was 
dramatically enhanced (Figure 4B). HAE-1 preferentially binds to 
nonlipidated apoE4 and HAE-4 preferentially binds to nonlipidat-
ed apoE3 and apoE4. The binding preferences of HAE-1 to apoE4 
and HAE-4 to apoE3 and apoE4 are retained with heat treatment 
(Supplemental Figure 6). In other words, HAE-1 and HAE-4 show 
strong preferential binding to aggregated apoE4 (HAE-1) or to 
apoE3 and apoE4 (HAE-4). Heat treatment of apoE resulted in the 
formation of apoE aggregates that could be recovered in the pel-
let fraction following ultracentrifugation at 186,000 g for 1 hour 
(Figure 4C). See complete unedited blots in the supplemental 
material. Compared with apoE recovered from the supernatant 
fraction, HAE-4 was able to bind apoE from the pellet fraction 
much more readily (Figure 4D). This suggests that HAE-4 prefer-
entially recognizes aggregated apoE generated by heat treatment. 
Solubilization of the apoE aggregates using 1% SDS or 4 M guani-
dine eliminated the preference of HAE-4 for heat-induced apoE 
aggregates (Figure 4E). In summary, these data suggest that HAE-
4 preferentially binds to aggregated forms of apoE, which may be 
the predominant form of apoE found in the plaques of APPPS1-21 
mouse and human brain sections.
Binding of HAE-4 to brain apoE in vivo. Next, we tested whether 
HAE-1 and HAE-4 could bind to apoE in the brains of living mice. A 
mouse IgG2ab (control), HAE-1, and HAE-4 were conjugated with 
Alexa 594 and applied to the brain surface (40 μl of 1 mg/ml) of 
6-month-old APPPS1-21/APOE4 mice. Antibody localization was 
monitored through a cranial window using 2-photon microscopy 
(Figure 5A). HAE-1 and HAE-4 were found to localize to amyloid 
plaques. To test whether peripherally administered apoE antibod-
ies could enter the brain and bind to apoE in plaques, chi–HAE-4 
or control human IgG were i.p. injected (50 mg/kg) for 1 or 2 doses 
into 5- to 6-month-old APPPS1-21/APOE4 mice. Two days after 
the final injection, chi–HAE-4 was detected bound to plaques in the 
dosed mice (Figure 5B). This indicated that chi–HAE-4 was able to 
enter the brain and bind to apoE in the Aβ plaques in living animals.
The effects of HAE-1 and HAE-4 on microglial activation and 
Aβ deposition: requirement of a microglial response. To determine 
whether HAE-1 and HAE-4 antibodies can increase activated 
microglia or infiltrating monocytes, we quantified CD45+ cells rel-
ative to the amount of fibrillar plaques after short-term treatment 
of HAE-1 and HAE-4 antibodies (4 doses by i.p. injection every 3 
days) in 4-month-old APPPS1-21/APOE4 mice that already had 
existing plaques (Figure 6A and Supplemental Figure 7). After 
acute passive immunization, HAE-1 had no effect on the amount 
of CD45+ cells, whereas HAE-4 significantly increased the CD45+ 
cells compared with the controls (Figure 6A). Interestingly, there 
was no increase in the number of Iba-1+ cells around plaques fol-
lowing HAE-4 treatment (1.02 × 10–4 ± 8.63 × 10–6 cells/μm3 for

(n = 6) conjugated with Alexa 594 were applied directly onto the surface of the brain in living APPPS1-21/APOE4 mice that were 6 months of age, and 
antibody localization was observed using 2-photon microscopy. Amyloid was labeled using methoxy-X04. The signal from Alexa 594 and methoxy-X04 was 
merged (MERGE) to show the colocalization of antibodies and plaques. (B) Control human IgG (n = 2) or chi–HAE-4 at 50 mg/kg body weight was injected 
i.p. in 1 dose (0 hour, n = 3) or 2 doses (0 and 48 hour, n = 3). APPPS1-21/APOE4 mice were sacrificed 48 hours after final injection. The antibodies in the 
brain were detected by biotinylated rabbit anti–human IgG followed by DAB. Left panel, bar = 1 mm. Right panel, high-power image of the indicated areas

7) suggesting that together with the CD45 data the total number 
of either microglia or infiltrating monocytes around plaques was 
not increased, but the cells present were in a more activated state. 
Although HAE-1 and HAE-4 can bind to apoE in plaques, anti-
body-driven plaque reduction may be dependent upon microglial 
activation. In order to assess whether microglia are required for 
an HAE-1– or HAE-4–dependent decrease in Aβ accumulation, 
we used AAV serotype 2/8 to drive the expression and secretion 
of full-length HAE-1 and HAE-4 antibodies with and without a 
D265A mutation in the Fc domain. The D265A mutation removes 
virtually all binding to Fcγ receptors and prevents these antibod-
ies from effectively activating microglia (17). AAV vectors express-
ing these antibodies (all with an IgG2ab Fc domain or a control 
IgG2ab antibody) were injected into APPPS1-21/APOE4 mice at 
P0. Mice were then sacrificed at 3.5 months of age and assessed. 
We measured the levels of HAE-1 and HAE-4 antibodies with 
and without the D265 mutation in the cortex and found that they 
were all expressed at similar levels with no statistical differences 
among the different antibodies (Supplemental Figure 8). The 
levels of HAE-1 and HAE-4 were much higher in the cortex with 
AAV-mediated expression (over 20 ng/100 mg tissue) in the mice 
at 3.5 months of age than they were after 6 weeks of i.p. injections 
(~6 ng/100 mg tissue). Following AAV-mediated expression of 
HAE-1 or HAE-4 in APPPS1-21/APOE4 mice, there was a strong 
and significant reduction of Aβ immunostaining, fibrillar Aβ, and 
insoluble Aβ40 and Aβ42 as compared with control antibody–treat-
ed mice (Figure 6, B–E). In contrast, the AAVs expressing HAE-1 or 
HAE-4 with a D265A mutation had no effect on Aβ immunostain-
ing, fibrillar Aβ, and insoluble Aβ40 or Aβ42 relative to the control 
antibody (Figure 6, B–E). This strongly suggests that anti–apoE 
antibodies that bind to apoE in Aβ plaques decrease Aβ accumula-
tion through an FcγR-mediated mechanism.
Discussion
In the present study, we report that both i.c.v. and i.p. administra-
tion of the anti–human apoE antibody HAE-4 (specific for apoE3 
and apoE4) into APP transgenic mice expressing human apoE4 
significantly reduced Aβ plaque load and Aβ accumulation in the 
brain. HAE-4 preferentially binds to nonlipidated forms of apoE as 
compared with lipidated apoE, which is the major form of apoE in 
vivo. When monomeric and aggregated forms of apoE were com-
pared, HAE-4 preferentially bound to apoE aggregates. HAE-4 
bound to apoE in amyloid plaques after direct application to the 
brain surface or after peripheral administration into living ani-
mals. Importantly, HAE-4 did not significantly alter the levels of 
total apoE in the brain or plasma, and both HAE-1 and HAE-4 were 
able to reduce plaque accumulation by direct central administra-
tion or expression via AAV. This effect appears to require micro-
glial activation, as the corresponding antibodies with mutations in 
the Fc effector domain of the antibodies that ablate Fcγ receptor 
binding are not effective in plaque clearance. Overall, these find-
ings demonstrate that certain anti–apoE antibodies selective for 
nonlipidated, aggregated apoE, such as HAE-1 and HAE-4, can 
preferentially bind to apoE in plaques and have very similar effects 
to anti–Aβ antibodies that also bind to and decrease Aβ accumula-
Figure 6. Reduction of plaques by HAE-1 and HAE-4 requires 
effector function. (A) At the age of 4 months, the APPPS1-21/
APOE4 mice received 4 i.p. injections of 50 mg/kg of antibod-
ies every 3 days. The mice were sacrificed 24 hours after the 
final injection and the fibrillar plaques were stained with X-34 
and the activated microglia was stained with CD45. The ratio 
of percentage of area covered by CD45 staining/percentage of 
area covered by X-34 staining was quantified (equal numbers 
of male and female mice, n = 8–9/group). (B–E) APPPS1-21/
APOE4 mice were injected at day P0 with AAV 2/8 into the 
lateral ventricle (equal numbers of male and female mice, 
n = 17–25/group). AAV 2/8 is able to express and secrete 
full-length HAE-1 and HAE-4 antibodies as well as the same 
constructs with a D265A mutation in the Fc domain (HAE-1Δ 
and HAE-4Δ). At the age of 3.5 months, the Aβ plaques (B) 
were stained with antibody HJ3.4, the fibrillar plaques were 
stained with X-34 (C), and the insoluble Aβ42 (D) and Aβ40 
(E) were measured by ELISA. One-way ANOVA followed by 
Tukey’s t test was performed to compare different groups 
shown in A–E. Data are mean ± SEM. *P < 0.05, **P < 0.01, 
***P < 0.001, ****P < 0.0001.

study, we found that HAE-4 is able to bind to apoE in amyloid 
plaques, both on unfixed brain sections and in the brain of living 
APPPS1-21/APOE4 mice following central or peripheral injection. 
Further, we found that the ability of HAE-4 to decrease plaque 
accumulation was dependent on microglial activation. This sug-
gests that the key features of this antibody’s ability to decrease Aβ 
plaques are its selectivity toward binding a conformation of apoE 
in amyloid plaques, specifically apoE aggregates, and its ability to 
direct microglial-driven apoE-amyloid phagocytosis.
To better understand whether the antibody most effective at 
decreasing plaques was binding to a particular form of apoE that 
was selectively present in plaques and not normally found in brain 
or blood, we assessed the binding affinity of HAE-4 to lipidated 
verus nonlipidated apoE as well as monomeric versus aggregated 
apoE. We found that HAE-4 preferentially interacts with a nonlipi-
dated form of apoE as compared with lipidated forms that would 
be present in plasma, cerebrospinal fluid, or the extracellular space 
of the brain. This is the first report to our knowledge that suggests 
that targeting a specific conformational form of apoE reduces Aβ 
pathology in APP transgenic mice. Given that nonlipidated apoE 
is only a small percentage of total apoE in vivo (33), targeting this 
pool of apoE may underlie the lack of effect on apoE levels or lipid 
metabolism. Reduced binding to lipidated apoE contributes to the 
much longer plasma half-life of HAE-4 as compared with HAE-2 
and HAE-3, which strongly bind lipidated apoE (Figure 3F, Supple-
mental Figure 5). A longer half-life greatly increases both periph-
eral and brain exposure of the antibody and enables increased 
plaque decoration.
Previous work has shown that decreasing Aβ pathology by 
enhancing apoE lipidation via ATP-binding cassette transporter 
A1 (ABCA1) has beneficial effects (34–36), and that decreasing 
apoE lipidation increases Aβ pathology (37). It is possible that 
poorly lipidated apoE adopts a conformation more prone to aggre-
gation and thus promotes Aβ aggregation. In the present study, we 
demonstrated that a potent, plaque-reducing antibody may recog-
nize this form of aggregated apoE, which resides in Aβ plaques in 
APPPS1-21/APOE4 mice. In the future, the frequency and abun-
dance of HAE-4 immunoreactivity apoE in the brain of patients 
with AD will need to be determined.
We found that the effects of 2 different anti–apoE antibodies 
appear to require microglial-mediated Aβ phagocytosis, because 
versions of HAE-1 and HAE-4 lacking a functional Fc domain of 
the antibody were not able to decrease Aβ deposition. In addi-
tion, in APPPS1-21/APOE4 mice that already had plaques, HAE-4 
acute administration substantially increased CD45+ cells around 
plaques. A variety of anti–Aβ antibodies have been studied for 
their ability to decrease Aβ plaques both in animal models and 
in humans. The antibodies shown to have the greatest effects 
on Aβ deposition appear to work by binding certain Aβ species 
in plaques and then facilitating clearance via microglial phago-
cytosis (18, 19). The mechanism we demonstrate here for HAE-1 
and HAE-4 appears similar, except that these antibodies bind to 
an Aβ-binding molecule (i.e., apoE) and not directly to Aβ itself. 
The effects we see with these antibodies appear similar to that 
seen with Aβ antibodies that lower plaques. Whether the CD45+ 
reactive cells are microglia or infiltrating monocytes and to what 
extent FcR expressed by other cell types in the brain contribute 
tion via a microglial-mediated clearance mechanism (18, 19). Fur-
ther studies will be required to determine potential advantages 
and disadvantages to this approach versus the use of anti–Aβ anti-
bodies as a treatment modality.
Although apoE has been established as the strongest genetic 
factor for LOAD for more than 20 years, the mechanism(s) by 
which apoE modifies AD pathogenesis is still not entirely clear. 
However, a large body of literature shows that apoE affects AD 
at least in part through exacerbating Aβ aggregation and reduc-
ing its clearance (7, 20, 21). The effects of apoE isoform, level, or 
lipidation status on Aβ pathology have been extensively studied 
in vitro and in vivo (7, 21). Whether increasing or decreasing of 
apoE function or expression is beneficial for reducing Aβ pathol-
ogy has long been debated. Overexpression of apoE2 using viral 
vectors reduces Aβ pathology, whereas overexpression of apoE4 
increases Aβ pathology in APP transgenic mice (22–25). Increas-
ing apoE4 expression prior to but not after Aβ deposition enhanc-
es plaque burden (26). Genetic removal of endogenous murine 
apoE or reduction of apoE with antisense oligonucleotides prior 
to the onset of Aβ deposition decreases Aβ plaque load and fibril-
lar plaques in APP transgenic mice (27–29). Lowering apoE levels 
after Aβ deposition had started had no effect on Aβ levels (29). APP 
mice that express 1 copy of human apoE have markedly less Aβ 
pathology as compared with those expressing 2 copies of the same 
apoE isoform (30, 31). Blocking the interaction between apoE and 
Aβ using Aβ12-28p suppresses Aβ plaque deposition in APP trans-
genic mice (32). Taken together, only the overexpression of the 
apoE2 isoform appears beneficial, at least with respect to reducing 
Aβ accumulation. Based on the effects we describe, the ability to 
target specific pools of apoE might be an ideal therapeutic strategy 
to address the more than 60% of the patients with LOAD who are 
apoE4 carriers. Importantly, this approach of specifically targeting 
apoE in plaques allows for a direct antibody-mediated decrease in 
Aβ accumulation, in contrast to the alternate approach of simply 
lowering apoE levels. Whether anti–apoE antibodies such as HAE-
4 will clear existing apoE-containing plaques will need to be tested 
in future studies.
In previous studies, we found that anti–mouse apoE antibody 
HJ6.3 reduced Aβ plaque load in APPPS1 mice expressing murine 
apoE (10, 11). In those studies, we were not able to determine 
the mechanism whereby anti-apoE modulated plaque pathology. 
To better explore this issue, as well as to develop antibodies that 
bind to human apoE, we generated a series of anti–human apoE 
antibodies and assessed their efficacy and mechanism of action 
in mice that develop Aβ deposition and express human apoE4. 
We focused most of these studies on antibody HAE-4, as it was 
most effective at reducing plaques when given peripherally. We 
first analyzed the apoE levels in the treated animals. Similar to the 
findings in our previous study using anti–mouse apoE antibody 
HJ6.3 (10, 11), peripheral administration of HAE-4 did not change 
the level of plasma apoE or the level of total brain apoE in the tis-
sue lysates. Therefore, the effects of HAE-4 on Aβ plaques were 
not mediated simply by lowering total apoE levels. It was previ-
ously reported that a plaque-specific Aβ antibody (mE8) that tar-
gets only pyro-glutamated Aβ, a small proportion of Aβ in amyloid 
plaques, was able to localize to Aβ plaques and remove them by 
triggering microglia-mediated phagocytosis (19). In the present

Surface plasmon resonance. Anti–biotin antibody (catalog 28920233, 
GE Healthcare) was immobilized on the surface of a CM5 chip (GE 
Healthcare) through amine coupling. The surface was activated by 
injection of a mixture of EDC/NHS (1-ethyl-3-[3-dimethylaminopropyl] 
carbodiimide hydrochloride/N-hydroxysuccinimide) (GE Healthcare). 
Anti–biotin antibody was diluted in sodium acetate (pH 5.0 at 12.5 μg/
ml) and injected for 10 minutes at a flow rate of 5 μl/min, followed by 
injection of ethanolamine (GE Healthcare). Recombinant apoE4 was 
biotinylated using the EZ-Link Sulfo-NHS-LC-Biotin kit (ThermoFisher 
Scientific). Biotinylated apoE4 was captured on the chip to reach 550 
RU (HAE-1 and HAE-4) or 280 RU (HAE-2). A range of serially diluted 
antibodies (1.2 nM–100 nM for HAE-2; 12 nM–1,000 nM for HAE-1 and 
HAE-4) was injected at a flow rate of 30 μl/min, and sensorgrams were 
fitted using the 1:1 Langmuir model.
Intracerebroventricular antibody administration and sample collec-
tion. At the age of 2 months, APPPS1-21/APOE4 mice underwent sur-
gical implantation of a subcutaneous osmotic minipump (Alzet, model 
2006) connected to a catheter into the left lateral cerebral ventricle 
(Bregma –0.4 mm, 1.0 mm lateral to midline, 2.5 mm below the skull). 
The apoE antibodies or control antibodies (2 mg/ml) were filled into 
the osmotic minipump and continuously infused (i.c.v.) at the speed of 
0.15 μl/h for 6 weeks. At the age of 3.5 months, the mice were perfused 
with ice-cold PBS containing 0.3% heparin. The right hemibrain was 
dissected and flash-frozen on dry ice for biochemistry assays. The left 
hemibrain was fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde for histological analy-
sis. Serial coronal sections at 50-μm thickness were collected from the 
rostral to the caudal end of each brain hemisphere using a freezing 
sliding microtome (Leica Biosystems).
Intraperitoneal antibody administration and sample collection. Two-
month-old female APPPS1-21/APOE4 mice were injected i.p. with a 
weekly dose of 50 mg/kg body weight of control or HAE anti–apoE 
antibodies for 7 doses. At the age of 3.5 months, the mice were per-
fused with ice-cold PBS containing 0.3% heparin. The right hemibrain 
was dissected and flash-frozen on dry ice for biochemical assays for 
Aβ and apoE. The left hemibrain was fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde 
for 48 hours for histological analysis of amyloid plaque load. The fixed 
brains were sectioned by Multibrain Technology (NeuroScience Asso-
ciates NSA Labs) at a 50-μm thickness. For the dose-response study of 
HAE-4, another cohort of APPPS1-21/APOE4 mice received weekly 
i.p. injections of HAE-4 (2 mg/kg, 5 mg/kg, and 10 mg/kg), anti–Aβ 
HJ3.4 (50 mg/kg), or IgG2ab (50 mg/kg). The cortices were extracted 
sequentially in PBS and 5 M guanidine and the Aβ40 and Aβ42 in the 
guanidine fraction was assessed using ELISA.
ELISA for tissue lysates. To extract Aβ in different fractions, brain 
cortices were sequentially homogenized with cold PBS, 1% Triton-X 
100, and 5 M guanidine buffer in the presence of 1× protease inhibi-
tor mixture (Roche). The levels of Aβ40, Aβ42, and apoE were measured 
by sandwich ELISA. For Aβ40 or Aβ42, anti–Aβ35–40 HJ2 (produced in-
house) or anti–Aβ37–42 HJ7.4 (produced in-house) were used as capture 
antibodies, and anti–Aβ13–18 HJ5.1–biotin (produced in-house) was 
used as a detecting antibody (39). For apoE ELISA, HJ6.2 (produced 
in-house) (10) was used as the capture antibody and HJ6.1-biotin (pro-
duced in-house) (10) was used as the detecting antibody. Recombi-
nant apoE4 was used as the standard for the apoE ELISA. For assess-
ment of the concentration of rHAE-1, rHAE-1Δ, rHAE-4, and rHAE-4Δ 
following expression via AAV2/8, recombinant apoE4 was coated on 
96-well ELISA plates overnight at 4°C. After washing, individual puri-
to the process of decreasing Aβ accumulation needs to be sorted 
out in future studies. In addition to efficacy, it will be important 
to determine whether anti–apoE antibodies with features such 
as HAE-4 have any potential side effects. We were not able to 
determine whether there was an increase in microhemorrhages 
in the APPPS1-21/APOE4 mice following treatment with HAE-4, 
as there was very little amyloid angiopathy in this mouse model. 
Future studies addressing this issue may support the development 
of anti–apoE antibodies for the treatment of AD.
Methods
Animals. APPPS1-21 mice on a C57BL/6J background (gift from 
Mathias Jucker, Hertie Institute for Clinical Brain Research, Tub-
ingen, Germany) coexpress human APP with a Swedish mutation 
(KM670/671NL) and mutant PS1 with the L1669 mutation under the 
control of a Thy1 promoter (13). APOE2-, APOE3-, and APOE4-knock-
in mice express APOE E2, E3, and E4 under control of the endogenous 
mouse regulatory elements on a C57BL/6J background (38). EKO 
mice were purchased from Taconic. APPPS1-21/APOE4 mice were 
generated by breeding APPPS1-21 with APOE4 mice. The Aβ plaque 
pathology in APPPS1-21/APOE4 mice begins at the age of 2 months.
Generation of antibodies. The HAE antibodies were generated by 
injecting recombinant apoE4 with complete Freund’s adjuvant into 
mice. For an initial screening of antibodies, supernatants from hybrid-
oma cells were added to 96-well plates coated with recombinant apoE4 
and the HAE that bound to apoE4 was detected using anti–mouse IgG 
HRP. The antibodies that performed well in the initial screening were 
further characterized and selected for in vivo studies. For the in vivo 
study, antibodies were generated from cultured hybridoma cells and 
purified on a protein G column. All HAE antibodies utilized in vivo 
contained similar amounts of endotoxin as compared with control 
antibodies. All 4 anti–apoE antibodies studied are mouse IgGs. HAE-1 
is an IgG1. HAE-2, HAE-3, and HAE-4 are IgG2ab subtypes.
apoE binding ELISAs. Recombinant apoE (Leinco Technologies) 
was coated to half-area 96-well plates at 0.5 μg/ml in PBS overnight at 
4°C (25 μl/well). After 3 washes with PBS, the wells were blocked with 
1% BSA-PBS for 1 hour at room temperature with shaking at 500 rpm. 
The blocked wells were washed once with PBS and subsequently load-
ed with HAE antibodies at serial concentrations (starting at 300 nM 
with 3-fold dilutions thereafter). Bound HAE antibodies were detected 
with HRP-labeled goat anti–mouse IgG (catalog 115-035-003, Jackson 
ImmunoResearch Laboratories) and visualized with tetramethylben-
zidine (TMB) substrate at OD450 (reaction stopped with 4N H2SO4) or 
OD650 (reaction stopped with BioFX stop solution, Surmodics). For 
experiments where apoE aggregation was first induced by heating, 
recombinant apoE4 at a concentration of 1 mg/ml was first heated 
at 40°C for 24 hours and then coated directly to ELISA plates at 0.5 
μg/ml. To normalize the amount of apoE coated to the ELISA plates 
from the supernatant and pellet fractions after heating and ultra-
centrifugation, the relative amounts of apoE were first assessed by 
SDS-PAGE followed by a Coomassie blue stain. Heat-induced apoE4 
aggregates were denatured in 1% SDS or 4 M guanidine-HCl at 95°C 
for 10 minutes and then diluted to 0.5 μg/ml in PBS for coating onto 
ELISA plates. After overnight incubation at 4°C, the wells were washed 
3 times with PBS to remove any residual SDS or guanidine-HCl. ELISA 
experiments with heated apoE used HAE antibodies starting at 100 
nM with 5-fold dilutions thereafter.

mogenic reagent and reactions were stopped with BioFX stop solution. 
Plates were read at OD650. Replicate assays were performed and data 
from 1 experiment in duplicate are shown.
Pharmacokinetics of HAE antibodies in mice. Murine HAE-4 and 
control mouse Ig2a anti-HER2 were injected i.p. at 2 mg/kg, 10 mg/
kg, and 50 mg/kg, and plasma samples were collected by submandib-
ular puncture at various time points. Assessment of plasma antibody 
concentrations was performed using coated recombinant apoE4 (5 
μg/ml) to capture dosed HAE-4, and recombinant Her2 protein (R&D) 
(1 μg/ml) to capture the control antibody. Plates were blocked with 3% 
BSA in TBS/0.1%Tween for 1 hour and washed 3 times before incuba-
tion with plasma samples at a 1:2500 dilution. Bound antibodies were 
detected with HRP-anti–mouse IgG (catalog 115-035-003, Jackson 
ImmunoResearch Laboratories). The standard curve range was 0.49–
1000 ng/ml and fit with a 4-parameter logistic function.
Binding of HAE-1 and HAE-4 to apoE in the unfixed brain tissue. 
Brain tissue from APPPS1/APOE4 and APPPS1/EKO mice was sec-
tioned at 20-μm thickness using a cryotome (ULTRApro 5000, Vibra-
tome) and mounted on slides. The sections were stained with biotinyl-
ated HJ3.4, HAE-1, or HAE-4. The antibodies bound to the sections 
were detected using an ABC kit (Vector Laboratories) followed by DAB 
(Sigma-Aldrich).
Cranial window implantation, topical application of antibodies and 
multiphoton imaging. APPPS1-21/APOE4 mice (5.5–7 months old) 
were anesthetized under 1.5% isoflurane, and a 4-mm cranial window 
was drilled in order to expose the cortex, as previously described (24). 
After removing the dura matter, 40 μl of each antibody stock (1.0 mg/
ml), previously conjugated with Alexa 594 (Alexa Fluor 568 Antibody 
Labeling Kit, ThermoFisher Scientific), was topically applied for 30 
minutes. After 2 washes with sterile PBS, a glass coverslip was cement-
ed on the skull in order to seal the window before imaging. Fluores-
cein dextran (70,000 Da; 12.5 mg/ml in sterile PBS; Invitrogen) was 
also injected retroorbitally to provide a fluorescent angiogram. After 
a first set of images was taken in order to detect the signal from each 
antibody alone, methoxy-XO4 (5 mg/kg) was injected intravenously in 
order to label amyloid plaques as well as cerebral amyloid angiopathy, 
as previously described (40). In vivo multiphoton imaging was per-
formed using an Olympus FluoView FV1000MPE multiphoton laser-
scanning system mounted on an Olympus BX61WI microscope and an 
Olympus ×25 objective (numerical aperture = 1.05). A DeepSee Mai 
Tai Ti: sapphire mode-locked laser (Mai Tai; Spectra-Physics) gener-
ated 2-photon excitation at 800 nm, and detectors containing 3 pho-
tomultiplier tubes (Hamamatsu) collected emitted light in the range 
of 420–460 nm, 495–540 nm, and 575–630 nm. Mice were placed on 
the microscope stage, heated using a heating pad, and feedback regu-
lation was obtained from a rectal temperature probe (Harvard Appara-
tus). Z-series images (2 μm steps, depth of ~200 μm, 512 × 512 pixels) 
were taken to cover a large surface of the window. The laser power was 
measured and adjusted before each imaging and the settings of the 
photomultiplier tubes were unchanged throughout the different imag-
ing sessions and between all antibodies applied.
Binding of peripherally administered chi–HAE-4 to apoE in the brain. 
Chi–HAE-4 and control human IgG were injected i.p. at 50 mg/kg into 
4- to 6-month-old APPPS1-21/APOE4 mice for 1 (0 hour) or 2 (0 and 
48 hours) doses and the mice were sacrificed 48 hours after the final 
injection. The antibodies were detected using biotinylated rabbit anti–
human IgG (catalog ab97158, Abcam) followed by DAB.
fied hybridoma-derived and purified HAE-1 or HAE-4 were added to 
wells at different concentrations for a standard curve or the PBS-solu-
ble fraction of mouse cortex was added to the wells. Following wash-
ing, the antibodies were detected with HRP-coupled anti–mouse IgG.
Immunohistochemistry for Aβ pathology. Aβ plaques were immu-
nostained using biotinylated anti–Aβ1–13 monoclonal antibody HJ3.4B 
(produced in-house) (11). Fibrillar plaques were stained with 0.025% 
Thioflavin S (Sigma-Aldrich) or 10 nM X-34. Quantitative analysis of 
immunopositive staining was performed as previously described (39). 
All quantitation of Aβ and Thioflavin S staining was done by an inves-
tigator who was blind to both mouse genotype and treatment condi-
tion. Briefly, images of immunostained sections were exported with 
an NDP viewer (Hamamatsu Photonics), converted to 8-bit grayscale 
using ACDSee Pro 2 software (ACD Systems), thresholded to highlight 
positive staining, and analyzed using ImageJ software (NIH). Three 
sections per mouse (Bregma, –1.4 mm caudal to Bregma, and –2.0 mm 
caudal to Bregma) were quantified (cortex dorsal to hippocampus) and 
the average was used to represent each mouse.
Binding of HAE antibodies to lipidated apoE. Blood was collected 
from the right atrium of 6-week-old, apoE-targeted replacement mice 
or EKO mice and centrifuged in plasma collection tubes (containing 
EDTA) at 14,000 g for 5 minutes. For the plasma-coat ELISA, plasma 
was diluted 50-fold in PBS and coated to the bottom of half-well ELI-
SA plates overnight at 4°C. Plates were washed with PBS and blocked 
in 5% BSA-PBS for 2 hours. Antibodies were serially diluted 5-fold 
(starting at 500 nM) in 5% BSA-PBS and incubated for 1 hour at room 
temperature with shaking (500 rpm). Plates were next washed exten-
sively in PBS and bound antibody was detected with an HRP-goat anti–
human secondary antibody (catalog 109-035-003, Jackson Immu-
noResearch Laboratories). TMB was used as the chromogenic reagent 
and reactions were stopped with BioFX stop solution. Plates were read 
at OD650. Replicate assays were performed and data from 1 experi-
ment in duplicate are shown. For the plasma-capturing experiment, 
antibodies were coated at 5 μg/ml in half-well ELISA plates overnight 
at 4°C. Plates were washed with PBS and blocked in 4% milk-PBS for 
2 hours. Mouse plasma was serially diluted 2-fold (starting at 10×) in 
5% BSA-PBS and incubated on the blocked plates for 3 hours at room 
temperature and shaken at 500 rpm. Plates were next washed exten-
sively in PBS and the captured apoE was detected with polyclonal 
goat anti–apoE (catalog 178479, Millipore). Anti–goat HRP (catalog 
705-035-147, Jackson ImmunoResearch Laboratories) and TMB were 
used as the detection secondary antibody and chromogenic reagent, 
respectively. Reactions were stopped with BioFX stop solution and 
plates were read at OD650. Replicate assays were performed and data 
from 1 experiment in duplicate are shown. For the plasma competi-
tion experiment, recombinant apoE4 was coated onto half-well plates 
at 0.5 μg/ml overnight at 4°C. Plates were washed extensively with 
PBS and blocked for 1 hour in 4% BSA-PBS. Antibodies were diluted 
in 4% BSA-PBS at double concentrations of the final stock solution 
and equal volume was added for preincubation with serially diluted 
plasma (also at a 2-fold final concentration) for 1 hour and shaken at 
500 rpm. Blocked plates were washed twice and the preincubated 
antibody/plasma solutions were added to the blocked plates for 1 hour 
at room temperature with shaking (500 rpm). Plates were next washed 
extensively in PBS and the bound primary antibody was detected with 
an HRP-goat anti–mouse secondary antibody (catalog 115-035-003, 
Jackson ImmunoResearch Laboratories). TMB was used as the chro-

extracted using PBS and 5 M guanidine, and Aβ40 and Aβ42 were mea-
sured by ELISA. The concentration of antibodies in the PBS fraction 
was also measured by ELISA.
Statistics. Two-tailed Student’s t test was used to determine 
whether there were significant differences between 2 groups unless 
otherwise specified. One-way ANOVA was used to compare differ-
ences among 3 or more groups, followed by Tukey’s t test unless other-
wise specified. Data in all the figures are mean ± SEM unless otherwise 
specified. P < 0.05 was considered significant.
Study approval. All animal experimental protocols were approved 
by the Animal Studies Committee at Washington University.

Acute injection of HAE antibodies and microglial activation staining. 
APPPS1-21/APOE4 mice received 4 doses of antibodies every 3 days 
at the age of 4 months. Each dose was 50 mg/kg (administered i.p.). 
The mice were sacrificed 24 hours after final injection. The fibrillar 
plaques were stained using X-34. Activated microglia were immunos-
tained using rat–anti CD45 (catalog MCA1388, BioRad) followed by 
biotinylated goat anti–rat IgG secondary antibody (catalog A10517, 
Life Technologies). Iba-1+ cells were detected using rabbit anti–Iba-1 
(catalog 019-19741, Wako) followed by donkey anti–rabbit IgG Alexa 
Fluor 647 (catalog A-31573, ThermoFisher Scientific). For quantifica-
tion, 3 Z-stack images were captured per animal on the Nikon A1R+ 
confocal microscope using ×20 objective at 1024 × 1024 pixel reso-
lution with a Z-step size of 1.1 μm at 32-μm thickness. These imag-
es were then processed using Imaris (Bitplane). The coordinates of 
X-34+ plaques and Iba-1+ microglia were determined using the Spots 
function and imported into Matlab (Mathworks). An automated script 
was used to determine the microglial density around plaque surfaces, 
and the number of microglia within a 30 μm radius was calculated.
Preparation and injection of AAV2/8 vectors expressing control anti-
body and HAE antibodies. The variable regions of heavy and light chain 
cDNA sequences of control IgG, HAE-1, and HAE-4 were cloned from 
hybridoma cells. The single open reading frame (ORF) of the heavy 
chain, Furin cleavage site, P2A, and the light chain was assembled 
by polymerase chain reaction. All antibody subtypes were switched 
to mouse IgG2ab. The assembled single ORF was inserted into AAV-
expressing vector (serotype 2) with a chicken β actin promoter. The 
D265A mutation on the CH2 region was generated by QuikChange 
(Agilent Technologies) site-directed mutagenesis. AAV vectors were 
prepared at Hope Center Viral Vector Core with serotype 8 helper 
vectors. On P0, APPPS1-21/APOE4 mice (mixed sexual phenotype, 
n = 17–25/group) received a bilateral i.c.v. injection of 2 μl AAV vec-
tor (1.0 × 1013 vg/ml). The mice were sacrificed at 3.5 months of age. 
After perfusion with PBS, one brain hemisphere was immersion fixed 
in 4% paraformaldehyde for further histological analysis and the other 
hemisphere was dissected for further biochemical analysis. For histol-
ogy, the brains were sectioned at 50 μm on a freezing sliding micro-
tome. The Aβ plaques were stained with anti–Aβ HJ3.4 and the fibril-
lar plaques were stained using X-34. The cortices were sequentially
