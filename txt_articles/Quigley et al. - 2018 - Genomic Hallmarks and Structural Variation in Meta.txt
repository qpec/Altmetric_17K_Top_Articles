 SUMMARY
While mutations affecting protein-coding regions
have been examined across many cancers, struc-
tural variants at the genome-wide level are still poorly
defined. Through integrative deep whole-genome
and -transcriptome analysis of 101 castration-resis-
tant prostate cancer metastases (109X tumor/38X
normal coverage), we identified structural variants
altering critical regulators of tumorigenesis and pro-
gression not detectable by exome approaches.
Notably, we observed amplification of an intergenic
enhancer region 624 kb upstream of the androgen
receptor (AR) in 81% of patients, correlating with
increased AR expression. Tandem duplication hot-
spots also occur near MYC, in lncRNAs associated
with post-translational
MYC regulation. Classes
of
structural
variations
were
linked
to
distinct
DNA repair deficiencies, suggesting their etiology,
including associations of CDK12 mutation with tan-
dem duplications, TP53 inactivation with inverted
rearrangements and chromothripsis, and BRCA2
inactivation with deletions. Together, these observa-
tions provide a comprehensive view of how struc-
tural variations affect critical regulators in metastatic
prostate cancer.
INTRODUCTION
Prostate cancer represents a common and clinically heteroge-
neous disease entity. While over 160,000 American men are
diagnosed with prostate cancer each year, <20% of patients
will
experience
progression
to
the
lethal
form
of
the
disease, termed metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer
(mCRPC) (Siegel et al., 2018). A major barrier to studying
mCRPC has been the difficulty in obtaining tumor samples, as
clinical biopsies of metastatic lesions are not routinely per-
formed. mCRPC has recently been evaluated by targeted or
whole-exome sequencing (Armenia et al., 2018; Beltran et al.,
2013; Grasso et al., 2012; Robinson et al., 2015; Zehir et al.,
2017). These studies identified alterations in pathways involving
androgen signaling, DNA repair, and phosphoinositide 3-kinase
(PI3K) signaling, as well as recurrent mutations in genes such as
SPOP, FOXA1, and IDH1. However, the exome represents <2%
of the genome, and outside of small case series (Gundem et al.,
2015; Wedge et al., 2018), the complete genomic landscape of
mCRPC remains largely unexplored.
Genomic structural variants (SVs) include genomic deletions,
insertions, tandem duplications, inversion rearrangements, and
inter-chromosomal translocations. SVs are prevalent in prostate
cancer, with gene fusions involving the E26 transformation-spe-
cific (ETS) family of transcription factors identified in 40%–60%
of cases (Maher et al., 2009; Tomlins et al., 2005, 2007). A recent
study in localized prostate cancer demonstrated clusters of
genomic rearrangements each occurring in 5%–6% of samples
(Fraser et al., 2017). In addition, previous studies have demon-
strated that SVs may define subtypes of ovarian, pancreatic,
and breast cancers (Nik-Zainal et al., 2016; Patch et al., 2015;
Waddell et al., 2015; Wang et al., 2017). Of note, the majority
of SVs involve intergenic or intronic noncoding regions of the
genome and are not captured by exome sequencing or tran-
scriptome
analysis.
A
key
advantage
of
whole-genome
sequencing (WGS) over exome sequencing is that WGS allows
the identification of SVs that alter the activity of key driver genes,
tumor suppressors, and regulatory elements.
To comprehensively investigate the genomic drivers of
mCRPC, we interrogated the whole genomes and transcrip-
tomes of mCRPC samples from over 100 patients at a mean
depth of 109X in tumors, a depth 2–3 times greater than that
achieved in previous large WGS studies in cancer. Deep
sequencing of a large patient cohort permitted us to discover
novel recurrent SVs and define the prevalence of these variations
in mCRPC. We discovered previously unidentified recurrent
SVs modulating tumor suppressors or oncogenes, identified
new rearrangements coupling noncoding genes to known can-
cer drivers, and uncovered novel global associations between
DNA repair alterations and SVs.
RESULTS
A multi-institutional consortium conducted a prospective IRB-
approved study (NCT02432001) that obtained and profiled met-
astatic tumor biopsies from prostate cancer patients with castra-
tion-resistant disease (Aggarwal et al., 2016). Image-guided core
biopsies were obtained (Holmes et al., 2017) and fresh-frozen.
Tumor tissue was centrally processed and banked. Laser cap-
ture microdissection was used to isolate samples enriched for
cancer, and sequencing of RNA was performed. Whole-genome
DNA sequencing was performed from frozen sections for tumor
and from peripheral blood for matched normal samples, obtain-
ing a mean depth of 109X in tumor and 38X in normal samples
(Figure S1). Paired end mRNA libraries were sequenced to
a median depth of 114 M paired reads. This report includes
results from 101 patients, including mCRPC lesions from bone
(n = 42), lymph node (n = 40), liver (n = 11), or other soft tissue
sites (n = 8) (clinical summary in Table 1, sample-level features
related to sequencing, molecular analysis, and biopsy site in
Table S1). Of these patients, 64% had received second-genera-
tion anti-androgen therapy (abiraterone: 47%, enzalutamide:
37%, both: 20%).
Structural Variations Disrupt Key Driver Genes
The frequency of genomic copy number alterations in our
mCRPC tumors was consistent with previous exome sequencing
reports (Armenia et al., 2018; Beltran et al., 2013; Grasso et al.,
2012; Robinson et al., 2015) (Figures 1A and S2A). The percent
of the genome altered in each sample ranged between 7% and
47% (median 23%; Table S1). The median mutation frequency
was 4.1 mutations/Mb, slightly lower than the 4.4 mutations/Mb
reported previously in mCRPC (Robinson et al., 2015), but
greater than the 0.53 mutations/Mb reported in primary prostate
cancer (Fraser et al., 2017). Approximately 40% of tumors were
triploid (Figure S2B; Table S1). Triploid status was associated

 with more translocations and mutations overall (p < 0.007, Fig-
ures S2C and S2D).
We systematically identified loci most frequently affected by
structural variations by counting SVs within 1 Mb windows
genome-wide (SV per window 9.6 ± 5.1; mean ± SD, listed in
Table S2). The frequency of SVs is plotted in concert with copy
number alteration frequencies in Figure 1A. The loci most
frequently affected by SV (>3 SD from mean) contained key
drivers of prostate cancer, underscoring the importance of struc-
tural variation in this disease. This included AR, the transmem-
brane serine protease 2 (TMPRSS2), and ETS transcription fac-
tor (ERG) genes that produce the TMPRSS2/ERG fusion protein,
the oncogene MYC, Forkhead Box protein A1 (FOXA1), and
phosphatase and tensin homolog (PTEN). This analysis also
identified clusters of deletions affecting genes at fragile sites
previously identified in more than one cancer type (Bignell
et al., 2010; Glover et al., 2017).
An integrated analysis of SVs and mRNA expression levels
was then used to define cases where SVs were predicted to
inactivate tumor suppressors. PTEN was affected by biallelic
alterations in 36% of tumors and monoallelic alterations in
26% of tumors (Figure 1B). The PTEN sequence or promoter
was frequently interrupted by a translocation (7% of cases) or in-
verted rearrangement (5% of cases, Figure S3A). SV were essen-
tial to assigning biallelic PTEN alteration status in 8% of cases
and mono-allelic PTEN alteration status in 5% of cases (Fig-
ure 1B, left). TP53 was affected by biallelic somatic alterations
in 46% of tumors and monoallelic alterations in 30% of tumors,
with 11% of the biallelic assignments due to SV gene disruption.
SVs also contributed to biallelic inactivation of RB1 (12% bial-
lelic, 3% by SV), CDKN1B (7% biallelic, 1% by SV), and CHD1
(7% biallelic, 2% by SV) (Figure 1B). There was a significant as-
sociation between the number of inactivated alleles and mRNA
levels of PTEN, TP53, CDKN1B, RB1, and CHD1 (Figure 1B,
right), suggesting monoallelic alterations impacted expression
levels of these genes.
Novel Gene Fusions Predicted to Activate Oncogenes
We then determined cases where structural variants were pre-
dicted to activate driver genes by integrating SV data, mRNA
expression levels, and predicted mRNA fusions. A majority
of prostate cancers harbor fusions from the juxtaposition of
the 50 regulatory region of the androgen-responsive gene
TMPRSS2 upstream of ERG (Tomlins et al., 2005). We
observed mutually exclusive fusions activating the ETS family
members ERG, ETV1, ETV4, and ETV5 in 59% of our cohort
(Figure 1C; fusions listed in Table S3). In four cases, an ETS
family member fused to a gene not previously reported in
mCRPC, including ETV1 fusions driven by the solute carrier
SLC30A4 and ETV4 fusions driven by transmembrane and
coiled-coil domain family 2 (TMCC2), clathrin heavy chain
(CLTC), and cell division cycle 6 (CDC6). We also identified
novel fusions between coding and non-coding genes, exempli-
fied by SCHLAP1, a lncRNA highly enriched in a subset of
aggressive prostate cancers (Prensner et al., 2013). The PI3K
pathway member PIK3CA was expressed at very low levels
except for a single sample bearing a translocation that placed
the first exon of SCHLAP1 immediately downstream of the
PIK3CA 50 UTR, resulting in the overexpression of a full-length
PIK3CA transcript (Figure S3B). In two other cases, ETV1 was
translocated to chromosome 14 between FOXA1 and mirror-
image polydactyly 1 (MIPOL1). The lncRNA RP11-356O9.1
(also annotated as AL121790.1) lies in this region. Previously
published data showed that in normal tissues, RP11-356O9.1
is expressed exclusively in prostate (Figure S4). In these two
cases, the first exon of RP11-356O9.1 was fused to exon 4 or
exon 5 of ETV1 (Figure 1D). Fusions between ETV1 and this re-
gion have been previously reported in the prostate cancer cell
line MDA-PCa 2B (Tomlins et al., 2007) and in a single patient
sample (Abeshouse et al., 2015).
Multiple low-frequency gene fusions involving oncogenes,
including AXL, BRAF, and MYC, were also noted (Figures 1E
and S3B). A gene fusion joined prostatic acid phosphatase
(ACPP) residue 380 (NM_001009) to the transmembrane recep-
tor tyrosine kinase AXL at residue 429 (NM_001699), producing
an in-frame transcript. Review of an independent cohort of
patients with high risk primary prostate cancer identified a
similar ACPP-AXL fusion, demonstrating these fusions are a

 repeated finding (Figure S3C). In a case lacking high level MYC
DNA copy number amplification, ACPP was fused to MYC
within 150 nt of the MYC 50 untranslated region, originating
within the second and third ACPP exons. Collectively, these
novel, low frequency gene fusions could represent therapeutic
targets in mCRPC.
Duplications Target AR, MYC, and FOXA1
Genomic duplication events are a mechanism of genome evolu-
tion (Ohno, 1970) and are known to alter specific drivers impor-
tant in cancer, such as FLT3 in acute myeloid leukemia and
BRAF in pilocytic astrocytoma (Jones et al., 2008; Nakao et al.,
1996). Unbiased analysis identified a region �624 kb upstream
of AR as the most frequent site of structural variation in mCRPC
(Table S2). AR amplification occurred in 70% of cases and was
associated with significantly elevated AR mRNA expression
(p = 9 3 10�8, Figures 2A, top, and 2B). Our result is consistent
with earlier findings that AR amplification is rare in primary pros-
tate cancer (Abeshouse et al., 2015) but common in mCRPC
(Robinson et al., 2015) and is a major mechanism of resistance
to androgen deprivation therapy (Visakorpi et al., 1995). The re-
gion of peak amplification upstream of AR at 66.94 Mb was
amplified in 81% of cases, 11% more frequently than AR itself
(Figure 2A, middle). Tumors frequently amplified both AR and
the upstream peak (68 cases), but in 13 cases the upstream
peak alone was amplified (Figure 2B). DNA copy gain at the
upstream peak in cases that lacked AR amplification was signif-
icantly associated with elevated AR expression (p = 0.003,
Figure 2B), indicating that amplification of the upstream peak
was independently associated with AR expression levels. Cases
with amplification of both the upstream peak and AR had signif-
icantly higher expression than cases where only the upstream
peak was amplified (p = 0.01, Figure 2B), consistent with additive
effects.
Tandem duplications at the upstream peak corresponding to
copy number gain break points were observed in 36% of all
cases and in 44% of the 81 cases bearing copy gain at this re-
gion. Focal tandem duplication of the upstream peak region
was almost exclusive to patients lacking or with low AR amplifi-
cation (p < 0.0007, hypergeometric test, Figure 2C), consistent
with tandem duplication at the peak being a sufficient alternative
to AR amplification. The presence of amplification at this peak
was not associated with previous treatment with the second-
line hormone therapies abiraterone or enzalutamide (Table S4).
We assessed the frequency of H3K27ac occupancy within the
upstream peak, as H2K27ac enrichment is associated with po-
tential enhancer activity (Heintzman et al., 2009). Previously pub-
lished data from 19 primary prostate tumors revealed that the
minimally targeted region at the upstream peak was enriched
for H3K27ac histone modifications (Kron et al., 2017) (Figure 2A,
middle and bottom). Collectively, these data support the detec-
tion of an enhancer, amplified in 81% of castration-resistant
metastatic patients, that can act independently of AR locus
amplification to increase expression of AR in response to first-
line ADT.
Intergenic regions near MYC at 8q24 and FOXA1 at 14q13.3
were also frequent targets of SVs (Table S2). We observed
distinct tandem duplication peaks 700 and 300 kb. upstream
of MYC, with duplication frequencies of 25% and 23%,
respectively (Figure 2D, top, middle). The farther region included
three long non-coding RNAs: prostate cancer associated tran-
script -1 and -2 (PCAT-1, PCAT-2), and prostate cancer associ-
ated non-coding RNA 1 (PRNCR1). The degree of MYC copy
number amplification was modestly associated with MYC
mRNA expression levels (rho = 0.28, p = 0.005). Although
PRNCR1 is unlikely to be implicated in mCRPC pathogenesis
(Prensner et al., 2014), PCAT-1 has been shown to upregulate
cMyc
protein
levels
post-translationally
(Prensner
et
al.,
2014b). The nearer region included additional non-coding genes,
as well as the rs6983267 and rs1447295 germline variants asso-
ciated with prostate cancer risk (Amundadottir et al., 2006;
Yeager et al., 2007). Tandem duplications overlapping FOXA1
and/or the adjacent gene mirror-image polydactyl 1 (MIPOL1)
were present in 14% of samples (Figure 2E). These events
were less frequent than AR or MYC events described above,
precluding nomination of a candidate local peak, but several
sites in this region had H3K27ac enrichment (Figure 2E). Three
of the 14 samples bearing tandem duplications in this region
also bore FOXA1 mutations. Observations of ETV1 transloca-
tions into this region by us (Figure 1D) and others (Abeshouse
et al., 2015; Tomlins et al., 2007) suggest that SVs at this locus
play a role in prostate cancer. These observations collectively
demonstrate that unbiased analysis of tandem duplications by
whole-genome sequencing identifies loci that are selected for
amplification near driver genes such AR, MYC, and FOXA1 in
metastatic prostate cancer, and this selection potentially drives
disease progression.
DNA Repair Defects Drive SVs
To explore the etiology of SVs in prostate cancer, we identified
alterations associated with SV frequency. The number of SVs
identified in individual tumors ranged between 103 and 923
(337 ± 166, mean ± SD, Figure 3A). Deletion frequency was
significantly higher in tumors with biallelic BRCA2 mutations
(p = 4 3 10�6) (Figures 3B, left, and 3C). Additionally, we
observed that biallelic inactivation of CDK12 was associated
with a significant increase in tandem duplications with a bimodal
length distribution (Figures 3B center, 3C, and S5) (p = 0.003).
These results were consistent with results previously reported
in ovarian cancer (Popova et al., 2016).
We noted that the number of inverted rearrangements and
deletions observed in each sample was significantly correlated
(rho = 0.54, p < 4 3 10�10, Figure 3D). Tumors bearing large
numbers of both deletions and inverted rearrangements had

 all undergone chromothripsis, the shattering and subsequent
reconstruction of a single chromosome (Figure 3C, right; Fig-
ure 3D, orange points) (Fraser et al., 2017; Maher and Wilson,
2012; Stephens et al., 2011; Zack et al., 2013) (Figure 3B, right).
We identified chromothripsis in 23% of mCRPC (Figure 3A, 3D;
samples listed in Table S1), compared with 20% reported
in non-indolent primary prostate tumors (Fraser et al., 2017).
Biallelic TP53 inactivation was the event most significantly
associated with elevated inverted rearrangement frequency
(median 57 versus 79 inversion rearrangements, p = 0.0004)
and with the presence of chromothripsis (19 of the 23 cases
with chromothripsis versus 28 of the 78 cases lacking chromo-
thripsis, p = 0.0004). No locus was preferentially targeted
by chromothripsis, consistent with a stochastic process. No
tumor with biallelic loss of BRCA2 also exhibited chromo-
thripsis (Figures 3A and 3D). As observed in a previous pan-
cancer analysis, chromothripsis was not associated with an

In
contrast,
BRCA2
loss
had
the strongest statistical association with
tumor mutational burden (median 7.0
versus 4.0 mutations/Mb, p = 0.0002,
Figure 3E).
Chromoplexy, a balanced interweaving
of interchromosomal translocations, has
been observed in prostate cancer (Baca
et al., 2013). We identified chromoplexy
in 50% of samples (Table S1). Of the 23
samples with chromothripsis, 12 (52%)
also showed chromoplexy, as expected
if there were neither positive nor negative
enrichment for chromothripsis in samples
that had undergone chromoplexy. The
presence of somatic TP53 alterations
was not associated with either transloca-
tion frequency or with the presence of
chromoplexy.
Our
analysis
therefore
identified biallelic inactivation of CDK12,
BRCA2, and TP53 as strongly linked to
three forms of SV in mCRPC, with the
link between TP53 inactivation and inversion rearrangements
further linked to chromothripsis.
Mutational Signatures of DNA Damage
Cells bearing homologous recombination repair defects develop
genomic scars (reviewed in Lord and Ashworth, 2016), including
deletions with homology at both ends of the deleted region.
These cells rely on microhomology-mediated end joining to
repair double strand DNA breaks, also known as alternative
nonhomologous end-joining (Davies et al., 2017; Nik-Zainal
et al., 2012, 2016; Tutt et al., 2001). Tumors bearing biallelic
loss of BRCA2 had elevated levels of deletions with flanking
microhomology (Figure 4A). Tumors with biallelic inactivation of
CDK12 or ATM, or with monoallelic alterations in BRCA1 or
BRCA2, lacked this phenotype, confirming previously published
observations (Polak et al., 2017). We fitted published mutation
signature profiles to somatic single nucleotide variations and

 performed de novo mutational profile signature analysis using
non-negative matrix factorization (Alexandrov et al., 2013).
A solution including eight de novo signatures provided the
optimal balance between variance explained and parsimonious
modeling. Signature de novo 8 was strongly associated with
samples bearing biallelic BRCA2 inactivation (Figures 4A and
S6A) and closely resembled COSMIC signatures 3 and 8 (Figures
4A and S6B), previously associated with defects in homologous
recombination DNA repair (HRD) (Alexandrov et al., 2013; Nik-
Zainal et al., 2016). COSMIC 3 signature fit was significantly
elevated in samples bearing biallelic loss of BRCA2, consistent
with previous reports in breast, ovarian, and prostate cancer
(p = 4 3 10�7, Figures 4A and 4B).
A sample with heterozygous mutation of both BRCA1 and
BRCA2 lacked an elevated microhomology deletion frequency,
but nevertheless showed strong de novo 8 and COSMIC 3 signa-
ture scores. In all, 6% of cases harbored compound BRCA1/2
heterozygosity, either by single copy DNA loss (n = 5) or somatic
mutation (n = 1). These samples had significantly elevated muta-

ples (Figure 4B). Compound heterozygous
samples had COSMIC 3 signature scores
intermediate between cases with biallelic
BRCA2 inactivation and cases with one
or zero BRCA1/2 alleles affected (Fig-
ure 4C), but the difference in signature fit
was not statistically significant.
The other robust de novo signatures
identified
in this
cohort recapitulated
known
signatures
(Alexandrov
et
al.,
2013). These included de novo 1, likely
identical to COSMIC signature 1 associ-
ated with spontaneous deamination of
5-methylcytosine associated with age at
tumor diagnosis (Alexandrov et al., 2015),
and de novo 5, present in a hypermutated sample with deep dele-
tion of mutS homolog 2 (MSH2) and MSH6, mismatch repair
genes 300 kb apart on chromosome 2. This signature bore the
strongest similarity to COSMIC 6 (associated with defective
MMR) and COSMIC 9 (activation-induced deaminase activity
during hypermutation). These data confirmed that DNA repair
defects in mismatch repair and homologous recombination
can produce genomic scars in metastatic prostate cancer
and showed that BRCA1/2 compound heterozygosity produces
a mutational phenotype distinct from that of biallelic BRCA2
inactivation.
A Landscape of Mutations and Structural Alterations
Somatic alterations and structural variants for 44 key prostate
cancer genes are shown in Figure 5, and listed in Table S5.
The somatic mutation frequencies were consistent with previous
reports in mCRPC (Armenia et al., 2018; Robinson et al., 2015).
In total, 85% of mCRPC samples carried either pathogenic
activating AR mutations, amplifications of AR, or putative AR

 enhancer region amplifications, an increase over the 63% of
cases identified as carrying AR alterations in a benchmark
exome study of comparable size (Robinson et al., 2015). ETS
family genes were activated by fusions in 59% of cases. We
observed MAPK driver mutations in HRAS (p.Q61K, 2%) and
BRAF (p.G469A, 1%). Putative dominant negative SPOP muta-
tions were present in 5% of cases (Barbieri et al., 2012; Blattner
et al., 2017). ETS gene family activations were mutually exclusive
with activating alterations in the RAS/MAPK pathway members
(p = 0.01, Fisher’s exact test) and with inactivation of SPOP
and CHD1 (Barbieri et al., 2012; Burkhardt et al., 2013; Huang
et al., 2012). A single IDH1 mutation at the previously reported
p.R132C hotspot was observed (Abeshouse et al., 2015).
Additionally, mutually exclusive alterations affecting genes
that modulate the AR pathway (FOXA1, NCOR1, NCOR2, and
ASXL2) were present in 29% of cases. Alterations in WNT
pathway members CTNNB1, APC, and ZNRF3 that were pre-
dicted to activate WNT signaling were mutually exclusive in all
but one of the 17% of cases where they were present. Previously
unreported inactivating events targeting HDAC4 were present in
6% of cases. No somatic alteration was significantly associated
with tissue biopsy site after accounting for multiple testing
correction. We searched for recurrent point mutations affecting
the promoter, enhancer, and UTR regions of 574 known cancer
driver genes (Table S5). This analysis identified 101 mutations of
unknown significance; no variant was significantly associated
with expression or structural variation phenotypes.
We next assessed the frequency of mutations in genes
responsible for DNA damage repair. Inactivating germline alter-
ations were present in the DNA repair genes (BRCA2 and ATM)
in 4% of samples, a slightly lower frequency than the �10% fre-
quency observed in a large study of metastatic prostate tumors
(Pritchard et al., 2016). Somatic alterations alone accounted for
five of the eight cases of biallelic BRCA2 inactivation and all three
tumors carrying biallelic CDK12 inactivation. Biallelic BRCA2,
CDK12, and ATM inactivating mutations were mutually exclu-
sive, and the total frequency of biallelic BRCA2, CDK12, and
ATM inactivation was 15%. Two hypermutated samples were
present, consistent with the reported 3% frequency of mismatch
repair defects in mCRPC (Robinson et al., 2015). One hypermu-
tated sample bore deep deletion in mutS homolog 2 (MSH2) and
MSH6, mismatch repair genes 300 kb apart on chromosome 2,
an alteration predicted to abrogate mismatch repair.
DISCUSSION
In contrast to previously published large-scale analyses of pri-
mary and metastatic prostate cancer that have largely focused
on the coding genome (Abeshouse et al., 2015; Armenia et al.,
2018; Barbieri et al., 2012; Beltran et al., 2013; Fraser et al.,
2017; Robinson et al., 2015; Taylor et al., 2010; Wedge
et al., 2018), we have performed whole-genome analysis of me-
tastases from 101 mCRPC patients at 109x depth of coverage in
tumor samples. This coverage, 2-fold deeper than previous ef-
forts in this space (Wedge et al., 2018) and performed on a large
patient cohort, has produced a unique resource for dissecting
structural variation in metastatic prostate cancer samples. Our
data emphasize that structural variations may inactivate tumor
suppressors by disrupting the coding region of these genes
(Patch et al., 2015; Waddell et al., 2015), whereas both fusions
and alterations affecting intergenic regulatory elements appear
to activate driver genes. Fusions driving proteins such as AXL
or BRAF that can be targeted therapeutically may open direc-
tions for new treatments in mCRPC. We derived insight into
the etiology of structural variation, associating BRCA2, CDK12,
and TP53 with deletions, tandem duplications, and chromothrip-
sis. Our novel observation that non-coding RNAs such as
SCHLAP1 and RP11-356O9.1 drive oncogene expression high-
lights the under-explored role of non-coding genes in mCRPC
and will serve as the foundation for further studies of the non-
coding genome.
All of the men in this study had developed resistance following
front-line treatment with androgen deprivation therapy (ADT).
A key finding made possible by our integrated analysis of the
whole genome and transcriptome across a large population of
mCRPC patients is that amplification of a putative enhancer re-
gion 624 kb distant from AR was present in 81% of men and 85%
had either amplification or pathogenic activating AR mutation.
Our data support the model that amplification at the putative
enhancer locus results in increased AR expression. In 13% of

 men, putative enhancer amplification was present without alter-
ations in AR itself. This finding suggests that DNA copy gain
affecting this locus, commonly by tandem duplication, may be
a frequent mechanism by which prostate tumor cells initially
develop ADT resistance (Karantanos et al., 2013). Observations
of tandem duplication at putative enhancers near AR, MYC, and
FOXA1 underline the value of whole-genome analysis, even in
diseases where exome analysis has been performed in large
cohorts of patients.
We observed chromothripsis in 23% of mCRPC patients and
demonstrated that chromothripsis was significantly associated
with TP53 alterations. This observation supports the proposed
but unproven mechanistic association between TP53 alteration
and chromothripsis (Rausch et al., 2012; reviewed in Maher
and Wilson, 2012). However, TP53 alterations cannot be the
sole driver of chromothripsis, as chromothripsis is not wide-
spread in other tumors with high rates of TP53 inactivation
such as high grade serous ovarian carcinoma (Zack et al.,
2013). In our study, chromothripsis was mutually exclusive with
biallelic inactivation of BRCA2, inconsistent with a model where
cells lacking the ability to perform homologous recombination
repair of double-strand DNA breaks would be predisposed to
chromothripsis.
Our study linked biallelic inactivation of BRCA2 but not ATM or
CDK12 with deletions that manifest flanking microhomology (Fig-
ure 4A). It is not yet clear what combination of genotype and
genomic data will best identify the patients who will benefit

(Mateo
et al., 2015). The 6% of samples with com-
pound
BRCA1/BRCA2
heterozygosity
lacked deletions with flanking microho-
mology but had significantly increased
mutation rates not statistically distinguish-
able from biallelic BRCA2 tumors. Dis-
secting the functional consequences of
these alterations will have implications
for patient selection when considering
treatment with a PARP inhibitor (Lord
and Ashworth, 2016).
Our study demonstrates the utility of
whole-genome analysis across a clinically
relevant metastatic tumor cohort, as our
analysis led to multiple discoveries that
eluded existing exome-centric genomic
investigations in the advanced disease
setting. We have provided the first land-
scape of structural variants in mCRPC, a
substantial mutational class in this dis-
ease that will serve as a repository for
other researchers to continue exploring their biological and clin-
ical significance. Our data also provides the foundation for
further dissection of the non-coding genome through comple-
mentary profiling efforts (e.g., epigenetics) and subsequent pre-
clinical studies that may have translational impact in prostate
cancer patients.

EXPERIMENTAL MODEL AND SUBJECT DETAILS
Patient Cohort
Patient tissue samples were obtained through the Stand Up 2 Cancer/Prostate Cancer Foundation–funded West Coast Prostate
Cancer Dream Team project, a multi-center study that acquired biopsies of metastases from men with mCRPC. All patients were
male and ranged in age from 45-90 years when biopsied. See also Table 1 for additional clinical details. Samples were obtained
by image-guided core needle biopsy of metastatic lesions in bone, soft tissue, or an organ. Fresh-frozen tissue and peripheral blood
drawn at the time of biopsy was shipped to a central facility at UCSF for laser-capture microdissection and DNA and RNA extraction.
Human studies were approved and overseen by the UCSF Institutional Review Board. All individuals provided written informed
consent to obtain fresh tumor biopsies and to perform comprehensive molecular profiling of tumor and germline samples.
METHOD DETAILS
Sample Preparation and DNA Sequencing
Biopsies identified by histological assessment (H&E, serial section) to contain at least 50% tumor were selected for genomic DNA
(gDNA) isolation through microdissection of frozen sections (200-500 mm total section depth, QIAGEN QIAamp Fast DNA Tissue
Kit, Cat. 51404). Matched normal gDNA was extracted from peripheral blood drawn at time of biopsy (QIAGEN QIAamp DNA Blood
Mini Kit, Cat. 51104). Tumor and Normal DNA were quantified prior to library construction using PicoGreen (Quant-iTTM PicoGreen
dsDNA Reagent, ThermoFisher Scientific, Catalog #P11496). Quantifications were measured using a Spectromax Gemini XPS
(Molecular Devices). PCR-free paired-end libraries were generated by automated liquid handlers using 500-1000 ng input gDNA
and the Illumina DNA Sample Preparation HT Kit. Pre-fragmentation gDNA cleanup was performed using paramagnetic sample
purification beads (Agencourt AMPure XP reagents, Beckman Coulter). Samples were fragmented, and libraries size-selected
following fragmentation and end-repair using paramagnetic sample purification beads to enrich for short insert sizes. Final libraries
were quantified by qPCR and evaluated for quality using gel electrophoresis separation. DNA libraries were denatured, diluted
and clustered onto patterned flow cells using the Illumina cBot system with Illumina HiSeq X HD Paired End Cluster Kit reagents.
Clustered patterned flow cells were loaded onto HiSeq X instruments and sequenced on 151 bp paired-end, non- indexed runs
on independent lanes, using HiSeq X HD SBS Kit reagents. Illumina HiSeq Control Software (HCS), and Real-Time Analysis (RTA)
wren used with the HiSeq X sequencers for real-time image analysis, and base calling.
RNA Sequencing
Tumor cores were fresh-frozen in OCT for gene expression analysis. Laser capture microdissection was performed on frozen
sections to enrich for tumor content (Spritzer et al., 2013). Total RNA was isolated (Agilent Absolutely RNA Nano Prep, Cat.
400753) and samples of sufficient quality (Agilent Bioanalyzer RNA 6000 Pico, Cat. 5067-1513) were amplified using NuGEN Ovation
RNA-Seq System V2. cDNA fragmentation was performed on a Covaris M220 sonicator to 200bp. Libraries were generated using
NuGEN Ovation Ultralow System V2 for Illumina sequencing. RNA-Seq for 88 samples was performed on an Illumina NextSeq500
(High Output 150 cycle V2 reagents, Cat. FC-404-2002) in 2x76bp paired-end runs; 13 additional samples were sequenced on an
Illumina HiSeq2500 at 2x100bp (10), 2x101bp (2) and 2x50bp (1) paired-end runs.
Whole-Genome Sequencing Data Analysis
Whole-genome FASTQ files were uploaded to Illumina BaseSpace Sequence Hub (https://basespace.illumina.com). The Whole
Genome Sequencing (WGS) app version 7.0.1 was used to coordinate sample alignment to the NCBI GRCh38 PAR-masked with
decoys hs38d1 reference genome (hg38-decoy) and subsequent analytical steps. Reads were aligned against hg38-decoy using
the Isaac aligner version 04.17.06.15 (Raczy et al., 2013). Germline mutation analysis was performed using Strelka version 2.8.0 (Sa-
unders et al., 2012) filtered to require an assignment of PASS and snpEff version 4.3g (Cingolani et al., 2012b) labels of ‘‘pathogenic,’’
‘‘splice_donor,’’ ‘‘splice_acceptor,’’ ‘‘stop_gain,’’ or ‘‘frameshift.’’ Somatic mutation analysis was performed with Strelka and Mutect
version 1.1.7 (Cibulskis et al., 2013), excluding samples lacking a PASS designation. DNA structural variants were identified using
Manta version 1.1.1 (Chen et al., 2016), requiring calls to bear a PASS or MGE10kb designation, tumor split read + tumor paired
read R 10, matched normal split reads = 0, and matched normal paired reads = 0. DNA copy number variants were identified
using Canvas version 1.28.0-O01073 (Roller et al., 2016) and CopyCat (https://github.com/chrisamiller/copyCat) using the
runPairedSampleAnalysis method with default parameters and performing GC correction. Copy number ratios were segmented
by Circular Binary Segmentation implemented in the DNAcopy package (Olshen et al., 2004). RNA-seq analysis was performed using
the Illumina RNaseq alignment app v1.1.0, aligning RNA FASTQ files to hg38-decoy using STAR version 2.5.0b (Dobin et al., 2013).

broadinstitute.org/software/igv) and the Illumina Variant Interpreter (https://variantinterpreter.informatics.illumina.com).
Mutation signature analysis
To perform per-sample mutation counting, all somatic mutations that were not excluded by quality filtering steps were counted. For
mutation signature analysis this list was filtered using snpSift version 4.3g, including all alterations designated with the call ‘‘SNP’’
(Cingolani et al., 2012a). Evaluation of COSMIC mutation signatures was performed using the deconstructSigs package (Rosenthal
et al., 2016), using the BSgenome.Hsapiens.UCSC.hg38 reference, the signatures.cosmic comparison set, a signature.cutoff value
of 0.06, and a tri.counts.method parameter of ‘‘default.’’ De novo mutation signatures were derived using non-negative matrix factor-
ization implemented in the SomaticSignatures R package (Gehring et al., 2015).
Evaluation of deletions with flanking microhomology
Deletions bearing microhomology were identified by a script counting deletions with two or more nucleotides of identical sequence
between either 1) the 50 end of the deleted region (determined from the HG38 genome reference) and the 30 end following the deleted
region or 2) the 30 end of the deleted region and the 50 end immediately preceding the deletion.
Evaluation of chromothripsis and chromoplexy
Chromothripsis was evaluated by counting the number of insertions, deletions, and copy number alterations within a moving 20 Mb.
window positioned at 10 Kb. intervals along the entire genome, excluding telomeres and centromeres. Windows bearing at least
15 inversion rearrangements, 15 alternating copy number switches, and 10 deletions were called positive for chromothripsis. Chro-
moplexy was evaluated by applying the ChainFinder application version 1.0.1 (Baca et al., 2013) obtained from http://archive.
broadinstitute.org/cancer/cga/chainfinder, using a deletion threshold of �0.278 and a significance threshold of 0.05. The presence
of chromoplexy was defined by the presence of a chromoplexy chain connecting at least three chromosomes.
Noncoding mutation analysis
Recurrent promoter and untranslated region (UTR) point mutations were nominated by identifying mutations with variant allele fre-
quency of at least 10% that were present in gene untranslated regions, enhancers, or promoters. UTR and promoter annotation
were performed using ANNOVAR v2018Apr16 (Wang et al., 2010). Promoter regions were defined as 1 Kb upstream of the transcrip-
tion start site. Enhancer regions were nominated by intersecting regions predicted by GeneHancer (Fishilevich et al., 2017) with
regions enriched for H3K27ac histone modification identified by CHIPseq in (Kron et al., 2017). A peak in any of 19 samples in
that dataset was considered sufficient for inclusion in this analysis. Analysis of recurrent mutations in noncoding regions was
restricted to regulatory regions predicted to affect any of the 574 genes listed in Tier 1 of the COSMIC Cancer Gene Census v85,
obtained from https://cancer.sanger.ac.uk/cosmic/census (Futreal et al., 2004).
Data visualization and reporting
Circos plots were generated using the RCircos R package (Zhang et al., 2013).
QUANTIFICATION AND STATISTICAL ANALYSIS
Statistical Analysis
All statistical analysis was performed using R (v3.3.3) (R Core Team, 2018). Between-group comparisons of continuous variables
were performed with the Wilcoxon rank sum test. Contingency table tests were performed with Fisher’s exact test. Correlation
was assessed with Spearman’s correlation. All tests were two-sided.
