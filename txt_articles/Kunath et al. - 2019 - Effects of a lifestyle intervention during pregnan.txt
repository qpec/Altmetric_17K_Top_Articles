Abstract
Background: Excessive gestational weight gain (GWG) leads to obstetric complications, maternal postpartum
weight retention and an increased risk of offspring obesity. The GeliS study examines the effect of a lifestyle
intervention during pregnancy on the proportion of women with excessive GWG and pregnancy and obstetric
complications, as well as the long-term risk of maternal and infant obesity.
Methods: The GeliS study is a cluster-randomised multicentre controlled trial including 2286 women with a pre-
pregnancy BMI between 18.5 and 40.0 kg/m2 recruited from gynaecological and midwifery practices prior to the
end of the 12th week of gestation in five Bavarian regions. In the intervention regions, four lifestyle counselling
sessions covering a balanced healthy diet, regular physical activity and self-monitoring of weight gain were
performed by trained healthcare providers alongside routine pre- and postnatal practice visits. In the control
regions, leaflets with general recommendations for a healthy lifestyle during pregnancy were provided.
Results: The intervention did not result in a significant reduction of women showing excessive GWG (adjusted OR
0.95, 95% CI 0.66–1.38, p = 0.789), with 45.1% and 45.7% of women in the intervention and control groups,
respectively, gaining weight above the Institute of Medicine recommendations. Gestational diabetes mellitus was
diagnosed in 10.8% and 11.1% of women in the intervention and control groups, respectively (p = 0.622). Mean
birth weight and length were slightly lower in the intervention group (3313 ± 536 g vs. 3363 ± 498 g, p = 0.020;
51.1 ± 2.7 cm vs. 51.6 ± 2.5 cm, p = 0.001).
Conclusion: In the setting of routine prenatal care, lifestyle advice given by trained healthcare providers was not
successful in limiting GWG and pregnancy complications. Nevertheless, the potential long-term effects of the
intervention remain to be assessed.

 Background
The latest European Perinatal Health Report identified
22.6% of German women as being overweight (body
mass index (BMI) 25.0–29.9 kg/m2) and 13.7% as obese
(BMI ≥ 30.0 kg/m2) at the onset of pregnancy [1]. Ma-
ternal overweight and obesity can affect the course of
pregnancy, as well as delivery and the postpartum
health of both mothers and their infants [2, 3]. In
addition to a high pre-pregnancy BMI, excessive gesta-
tional weight gain (GWG) is an increasing public health
concern due to its potential contribution to pregnancy
and
obstetric
complications,
maternal
postpartum
weight retention and childhood obesity. With reference
to the recommendations for adequate weight gain dur-
ing pregnancy provided by the United States’ Institute
of Medicine (IOM) [4], there is a significant trend to-
wards excessive GWG [5]. In Germany, more than 40%
of pregnant women currently exceed the recommended
weight gain thresholds [6].
Pregnant women who gain weight excessively are
more likely to develop gestational diabetes mellitus
(GDM) [7, 8] and to retain weight in the postpartum
period [9]. These risks not only affect overweight
women or those with obesity, but also those entering
pregnancy with a normal BMI [8, 10, 11]. Further, high
maternal weight gain in pregnancy has been found to
increase the risk of high foetal birth weight and obstet-
ric complications [12]. In addition, high GWG has been
shown to raise the risk of childhood overweight and
obesity [13, 14], especially in infants born to women
with a normal pre-pregnancy BMI [15], which can per-
sist later in life [16, 17].
Over the last decade, a variety of lifestyle intervention
studies during pregnancy have tried to limit GWG and
to improve maternal and infant health. However, these
randomised controlled trials have shown rather modest
effects in reducing excessive GWG and its associated
health outcomes [18–21]. Nevertheless, several studies
involving diet and/or physical activity counselling sug-
gest effects on GWG, and a recent meta-analysis showed
a mean reduction of GWG by 0.7 kg due to lifestyle in-
terventions [22]. Yet, many lifestyle intervention trials
have focused only on overweight and/or obese women,
and trials recruiting women across the entire BMI range
do not always explicitly evaluate the effectiveness in
normal-weight women [23]. Further, only a limited num-
ber of small studies have tried to integrate lifestyle pro-
grammes into routine antenatal care outside of academic
settings [24–26]. Thus, there remains a clear need to de-
velop effective and efficient ‘real-world’ strategies limit-
ing GWG to appropriate levels in women with normal
weight, as well as in those overweight and with obesity.
We recently conducted the FeLIPO pilot trial (“Feasibility
of a lifestyle intervention in pregnancy to optimize maternal
weight development”) in order to evaluate the potential
to prevent excessive GWG within the setting of routine
prenatal care [27]. The intervention programme, which
focused on a balanced diet, physical activity and
self-monitoring of GWG, was delivered by an experi-
enced dietician and was effective in reducing the pro-
portion of women with excessive GWG according to
the IOM recommendations (38% vs. 60%, p = 0.032)
[27]. Based on the results of this pilot trial, the GeliS
(“Gesund leben in der Schwangerschaft”/Healthy living
in pregnancy) trial was designed to embody a true pub-
lic health approach, as it was performed within the
framework of the well-established German pre- and
postnatal care system used by almost every pregnant
woman in the country. The intervention offered compre-
hensive counselling on a healthy perinatal lifestyle at four
defined visits and aimed to prevent excessive GWG and
associated maternal and infant health outcomes.
Methods
Study design
The GeliS study is a public health project targeting ma-
ternal
and
infant
health
with
individual
lifestyle
counselling during pregnancy. The study was designed
as a prospective, multicentre, cluster-randomised, con-
trolled, open intervention trial in five administrative
regions of Bavaria, a federal state in south-eastern
Germany. Within these five regions, paired cluster ran-
domisation was conducted by matching two areas per
region according to birth figures and socioeconomic
status. In each of the five pairs, both urban and rural
districts were included. One area of each pair was ran-
domly assigned to the intervention and the other to the
control group. As the study was conducted in gynaeco-
logical and midwifery practices, it depicts the real-life
setting of routine prenatal care in Germany. A detailed
description of the rationale, study design and methods
has been previously published [28].
The study was conducted in accordance with the Dec-
laration of Helsinki as well as with current local regula-
tory requirements and laws. The study protocol was
approved by the ethics committee of the Technical Uni-
versity of Munich and registered at the ClinicalTrials.gov
Protocol Registration System (NCT01958307).
Participants
Women with a pre-pregnancy BMI of between ≥ 18.5
kg/m2 and ≤ 40.0 kg/m2 and a singleton pregnancy were
recruited prior to the end of the 12th week of gestation
by medical personnel in gynaecological and midwifery
practices. In order to represent the general healthy
population, underweight women or those with severe
obesity were excluded. Women were eligible if they were
aged between 18 and 43 years, had sufficient German

 language skills and provided written informed consent.
All women completed a short screening questionnaire to
obtain demographic data and pre-pregnancy weight.
Women with a multiple or complicated pregnancy and
women with severe pre-existing illnesses were excluded,
as previously described [28].
While participants in the control group (C) received gen-
eral information leaflets on a healthy lifestyle in pregnancy
and continued to attend routine prenatal care, participants
of the intervention group (IV) additionally obtained a com-
prehensive lifestyle intervention programme.
Lifestyle intervention programme
Pregnant women in the intervention group attended
three individual face-to-face counselling sessions during
the course of pregnancy (at 12–16, 16–20 and 30–34
weeks of gestation) and one after delivery at 6–8 weeks
postpartum, each lasting 30–45 minutes. Sessions were
delivered by previously trained midwives, gynaecolo-
gists or medical assistants from the participating gynae-
cological
practices.
The
training
consisted
of
two
seminars with a total of approximately 10 hours of
structured teaching. To ensure consistency in counsel-
ling practice and content, lifestyle counsellors obtained
a presentation binder with easily understandable mater-
ial to use in each counselling session as well as check-
lists for scheduling and documentation of sessions.
The counselling sessions were performed alongside
routine pre- and postnatal visits in gynaecological and
midwifery practices. Pregnant women were encouraged
to consume a balanced diet, engage in physical activity
and to self-monitor weight gain. For self-monitoring of
GWG, women received a weight-gain chart according
to their baseline BMI category, which depicted weight
development during the course of pregnancy as recom-
mended by the IOM [4, 28]. Information about a
healthy diet in pregnancy was based on the recommen-
dations of the Healthy Start – Young Family Network
[29]. Next to the general principles of healthy nutrition,
the relevance of critical nutrients (e.g. folate, iodine and
iron) in pregnancy was addressed. The importance of
avoiding alcohol and tobacco and of minimising the
risk of food-borne infections were emphasized. Women
were advised to achieve 150 minutes of moderate phys-
ical activity per week [30]. In order to facilitate adher-
ence to physical activity recommendations, women
received a brochure giving examples for appropriate ex-
ercise, a list of local prenatal exercise programmes and
a pedometer to enable self-monitoring of daily physical
activity. In addition to general information, individual
feedback on dietary habits and physical activity, as
assessed at study entry via questionnaires, was pro-
vided. Counsellors received checklists to compare be-
havioural parameters with recommendations in order
to ensure consistency in gathering feedback. More
details of the lifestyle programme are given in the
published study protocol [28].
As a measure of process evaluation, several medical
and midwifery practices were monitored to check if the
intervention programme was performed as intended.
For that purpose, a sample of lifestyle counselling ses-
sions were supervised by a member of the study team
who assessed the duration and delivery of content, as
well as the use of study materials.
Outcomes
The primary outcome of the study was measurement of
the proportion of participating women who developed
excessive GWG according to the IOM recommenda-
tions [4]. GWG was calculated as maternal weight at
the last prenatal visit minus the weight measured at the
first routine prenatal visit. Pre-pregnancy BMI calcula-
tion was based on self-reported pre-pregnancy weight
at the time of recruitment. Weight was routinely mea-
sured in gynaecological or midwifery practices at every
antenatal visit and was documented in the routinely
used maternity records.
Secondary
outcomes
included
the
incidence
of
GDM, other pregnancy and obstetric complications,
mode of delivery, anthropometric measures and health
status of the newborns, as well as maternal weight re-
tention (6–8 weeks postpartum). All data were ex-
tracted from maternity and birth records. For the
screening
and
diagnosis
of
GDM,
a
standardised
2-hour 75 g oral glucose tolerance test (OGTT) was
conducted at 24–28 weeks of gestation. In routine
care, a non-fasting pre-test with 50 g of glucose is
frequently applied, followed by a fasting 75 g test only
in case of a measured blood glucose level ≥ 135 mg/dL
(7.5 mmol/L) after 1 hour in the pre-test [31]. In the
GeliS study, gynaecologists were instructed to directly
perform the 75 g OGTT according to national and
international guidelines [32, 33]. GDM was diagnosed if
at least one of the following thresholds was equalled or
exceeded: fasting plasma glucose: 92 mg/dL (5.1 mmol/L),
1-hour value: 180 mg/dL (10.0 mmol/L), and 2-hour
value: 153 mg/dL (8.5 mmol/L). Depending on the sever-
ity, some of the women with a GDM diagnosis received
treatment (dietary counselling or insulin treatment) as
prescribed by the treating gynaecologists at their own dis-
cretion. However, every participating practice received in-
formation on the current national guidelines for the
management of GDM. To obtain additional information
on the presence and severity of GDM, glycated haemoglo-
bin was measured at 30–34 weeks of gestation.
Prior to the data entry at the Munich Study Centre,
all data were checked for quality and pseudonymised.

 Power calculation and statistical analysis
The study was designed to have 90% power to detect a
between-group difference of 10% in the primary out-
come, with a 5% significance level and an intraclass cor-
relation coefficient of 0.5% [28, 34]. Power calculation
was based on the proportion of women exceeding the
IOM weight gain recommendations and the results of
the pilot trial [27]. It was suggested that at least 40% of
women (BMI ≥ 18.5 kg/m2) in the control group would
gain weight in excess [14]. A reduction of this propor-
tion to 30% in the intervention group was expected.
Power calculation suggested a sample size of 1900
women [35]. Considering a drop-out rate of up to 20%
during pregnancy, as well as a potential imbalance in
group
size
between
the
intervention
and
control
groups, the recruitment of 2500 women was planned.
The primary outcome was compared between the
intervention and control groups using logistic regres-
sion models fit using generalised estimating equations
due to the cluster-randomised design [35]. Unadjusted
and adjusted analyses were conducted, adjusting for
pre-pregnancy BMI category, age, parity and gestational
age at the first prenatal visit. Subgroup analyses accord-
ing to pre-pregnancy BMI category were performed.
The presented results correspond to complete-case
analyses including all participants for whom primary
outcome data were available, apart from those women
who had a preterm delivery (< 37 weeks of gestation).
Women with preterm delivery were excluded from the
analysis in order to present the proportion of women
with excessive GWG in a full-term pregnancy. In
addition, multiple imputation using fully conditional
specification was used to generate 10 imputed datasets
with results pooled across these datasets [36]. Further, a
pre-specified per-protocol analysis was performed ex-
cluding those participants whose weight was not mea-
sured at screening or last visit prior to birth, who
violated inclusion/exclusion criteria or, for those in the
intervention group, who missed a lifestyle counselling
session or had a counselling session more than 2 weeks
later than planned.
The secondary outcomes were similarly compared be-
tween intervention and control groups, with linear, lo-
gistic and multinomial generalised estimating equation
models respectively fit for the continuous, binary and
categorical outcome variables.
All analyses were performed using SAS software,
version 9.4 for Windows (SAS Institute Inc., Cary,
NC, USA).
Results
Flow-chart and baseline characteristics of participants
The flow of participants in the GeliS trial is presented
in Fig. 1. Between the years 2013 and 2015, 2641
women were assessed for eligibility and 2286 were sub-
sequently recruited for study participation. Of these, 25
women were not eligible when reassessed, 1139 women
received lifestyle advice (delivered by 63 trained counsel-
lors) and 1122 standard antenatal care in 71 participating
practices (39 in the intervention regions and 32 in the
control regions). Primary outcome data of 1885 women
was included in the complete-case analysis. Reasons for
missing outcome data were miscarriage (n = 73), termin-
ation (n = 9) or severe pregnancy complications (n = 4). A
further 158 (7.0%) women dropped out from both groups
due to (multiple answers were possible) change of prac-
tice or residence (n = 65), decline of further study visits
(n = 59) or no longer reachable (n = 31). In total, 132
women were excluded from GWG analysis due to pre-
term delivery (Fig. 1). The data of 2018 children were
included in the analyses. The low drop-out rate enabled
recruitment to be stopped with a lower number of par-
ticipants than the originally planned 2500 women.
An overview of baseline characteristics is given in
Table 1. A total of 23.0% of included women were char-
acterised as overweight and 12.1% with obesity. Mean
self-reported weight and pre-pregnancy BMI were simi-
lar in the intervention and control groups (68.4 kg vs.
68.0 kg; 24.4 kg/m2 vs. 24.3 kg/m2). In the intervention
group, more women were nulliparous (62.0% vs. 53.0%).
Maternal age, gestational age at entry and educational
level were comparable between the two groups.
Gestational weight gain
Total weight gain and the proportion of women ex-
ceeding the IOM weight gain recommendations are
shown in Table 2. The IOM recommendations were
exceeded by 45.1% and 45.7% of women in the inter-
vention and control groups, respectively. There was no
statistically significant evidence of a difference between
groups (adjusted odds ratio 0.95, 95% confidence inter-
val (CI) 0.66 to 1.38, p = 0.789). The intraclass
correlation coefficient, reflecting potential systematic
differences between the clustered study regions, was
low (0.8%). Similar results for the primary outcome
were obtained in the per-protocol and the multiple im-
putation analyses (Additional file 1: Table S1). Sub-
group analyses according to pre-pregnancy BMI also
provided no evidence of differences in excessive GWG
between the intervention and control groups. Mean
total GWG was 14.7 kg in women with normal
pre-pregnancy weight, 14.0 kg in overweight women
and 11.0 kg in women with obesity, and did not signifi-
cantly differ between routine care and intervention group
(adjusted estimated mean difference for BMI groups com-
bined 0.1 kg, 95% CI – 0.8 to 1.0 kg, p = 0.838). Adherence
to IOM recommendations according to pre-pregnancy
BMI subgroups (Fig. 2) showed that excessive GWG was

 more frequent among overweight women (IV: 65.2%
and C: 69.0%) and those with obesity (IV: 63.9% and
C: 58.3%) compared to normal weight participants
(IV: 34.2% and C: 35.9%). In total, 21.4% in the interven-
tion and 19.9% in the control group gained weight below
IOM recommendations.
Maternal and obstetric outcomes
There were no major differences in maternal outcomes
between groups (Table 3). Gestational diabetes mellitus
was diagnosed in 10.8% of women allocated to the life-
style intervention and 11.1% of women in the control
group (adjusted odds ratio 0.84, 95% CI 0.41 to 1.71, p =

 0.622). GDM treatment was administered to 3.5% and
4.9% of women in the intervention and the control
groups, respectively. Mean glycated haemoglobin in late
pregnancy was 32.2 mmol/mol (5.1%) and 32.1 mmol/
mol (5.1%) in the intervention and control groups,
respectively. Elevated blood pressure was reported more
often in the intervention group (IV: 9.5% and C: 6.4%, p =
0.017). Mean short-term weight retention at 6–8 weeks
postpartum was 4.0 ± 4.8 kg in women receiving life-
style counselling and 4.3 ± 4.8 kg in the standard care

 group (p = 0.649). The intervention did not increase
the risk of complications such as vaginal bleeding or
preterm labour (Table 3).
Most obstetric outcomes did not significantly differ
between the two groups. However, elective and emer-
gency caesarean section rates were 15.5% and 14.8%,
respectively, in the intervention group and 11.6% and
15.9%, respectively, in the control group. Further,
labour was induced more often (IV: 17.3% vs. C: 23.5%,
p = 0.038) and preterm labour was more frequently
reported (IV: 1.6% vs. C: 2.9%, p = 0.003) in the control
group.
Neonatal outcomes
Neonatal outcomes are summarised in Table 4. Mean
birth weight and length were slightly lower in the
intervention group (weight: 3313 ± 536 g vs. 3363 ±
498 g, adjusted estimated mean difference – 44.0 g,
95% CI – 81.0 to – 7.0 g, p = 0.020; length: 51.1 ±
2.7 cm vs. 51.6 ± 2.5 cm, adjusted estimated mean
difference – 0.5 cm, 95% CI – 0.7 to – 0.2 cm, p = 0.001).
The proportion of neonates born large for gestational age
(LGA) and small for gestational age did not significantly
differ between groups. The rate of preterm births was low
in both groups (IV: 7.1% vs. C: 6.0%). One stillbirth was
observed in the intervention group and one neonatal
death was recorded in each group. The intervention did
not lead to a significant increase in neonatal complications
at birth such as adjustment disorders, cardiac irregularities
or hypoglycaemia (10.0% vs. 8.2%, p = 0.310; Table 4).
Process evaluation
The first planned appointment (at 12–16 weeks of
gestation) was attended by 98.3% of women in the
intervention group, the second (16–20 weeks of gesta-
tion) by 97.6%, the third (30–34 weeks of gestation) by
95.9%, and the postpartum session by 93.7% (Additional
file 2: Table S2). In total, 87.6% of women visited all

was 3.7. During pregnancy, 2.8 sessions were attended
on average. The majority of sessions were performed in
the correct time intervals (Additional file 2: Table S2).
The supervised counselling sessions had a median dur-
ation of 35 minutes (n = 53) (Additional file 3: Table

ling content was used in 86.8% of monitored sessions. In
69.6% of these cases, all the predefined counselling

 content was discussed. Weight monitoring with the pro-
vided weight-gain chart and individual counselling were
performed in 73.6% and 62.3% of supervised sessions, re-
spectively (Additional file 3: Table S3).
Discussion
The results of the GeliS study suggest that providing
lifestyle advice addressing diet, physical activity and
weight monitoring within routine care during preg-
nancy is not effective in avoiding excessive GWG or in
reducing total GWG. Except for a slight decrease in
birth weight and length, the antenatal intervention did
not notably affect the risk of developing GDM or any
other maternal or foetal outcome.
The GeliS trial was performed as a public health ap-
proach in the real-life setting of routine care. As re-
searchers have previously suggested [37, 38], study
procedures were adapted to the daily routine work of
gynaecological and midwifery practices in order to
allow an easy implementation of the intervention into
the German maternity healthcare system. To this end,
lifestyle
counselling
was
conducted
by
previously
trained medical personnel.
To our knowledge, there is no other trial to date that
has investigated the compatibility of an additional life-
style advisory component within routine healthcare for
pregnant women to such a large extent. Overall, 45.1%
of women who received the intervention exceeded the
IOM recommendations, compared to 45.7% of women
who received standard antenatal care. The lack of an
intervention effect is consistent with current research.
Despite an intensive intervention programme of eight
group sessions, the UPBEAT trial showed only small effects
on GWG in pregnant women with obesity (– 0.55 kg) [21].
A large meta-analysis of lifestyle intervention trials includ-
ing individual participant data of more than 12,000 preg-
nant women reached similar conclusions [22]. According
to the i-WIP collaborative group [22], lifestyle interventions
are able to reduce GWG, but the effect was quite small
(– 0.7 kg), and 37% of women still exceeded the weight gain
recommendations. Standard care differs between countries
and, thus, may influence the effectiveness of different inter-
ventions [39]. Moreover, the effect of lifestyle interventions
in different groups of women based on BMI category, age,
ethnicity, parity and risk status in pregnancy is not clear
[37], which complicates the comparability between studies.
Furthermore, the assessment of excessive GWG according
to the IOM recommendations is disputed as evidence to
support these guidelines and has been suggested as insuffi-
cient [40]. Especially in overweight women and those with
obesity, weight gain within the IOM recommendations has
been associated with both positive and adverse pregnancy
outcomes [40]. Nevertheless, the IOM guidelines represent
the current standard and are frequently applied [41].
As more than 40% of pregnant women in Germany
and elsewhere exceed these recommendations, resulting
in potentially adverse short- and long-term conse-
quences for mothers and infants, there is an urgent de-
mand
for
successful
interventions
[4,
6,
14,
42].
Additionally, pregnant women themselves are demand-
ing lifestyle counselling, as determined by the high
compliance to the GeliS intervention programme in
terms of attendance to the scheduled sessions. More
than 85% of women in the intervention group attended
all four counselling appointments, showing their will-
ingness to adhere to a healthy lifestyle. Together with
high rates of excessive GWG, this emphasizes the gap
between the current standard of prenatal care and the
need for information and support.
Among the secondary outcome parameters, GDM was
diagnosed with a 2-hour OGTT in the GeliS trial. At
least one of the GDM diagnostic threshold values [33]
was exceeded by 11.0% of the tested study participants,
although this was slightly lower than the overall preva-
lence estimate for Germany (13.2%) [31]. As an import-
ant finding, the GeliS intervention did not lead to a
reduction in GDM. However, most women had an ad-
equate metabolic control, as assessed by the measurement
of glycated haemoglobin, and only a minority required ac-
tive treatment. This result is in line with observations
from recent meta-analyses and reviews [22, 43, 44].
Despite most maternal and neonatal outcomes being
unaffected by the intervention, a few differences were
observed. Elective caesarean sections were more fre-
quently reported in the intervention group. As mode of
delivery was not addressed during lifestyle counselling,
a specific effect of the intervention seems to be un-
likely. Due to the cluster randomisation, one possible
explanation could be differences in procedures between
hospitals in performing caesarean sections, which is
underpinned by a high variance in the caesarean section
rate between regions [45]. Further, labour had to be in-
duced more often in the control group than in the
intervention group. Labour is induced frequently, espe-
cially after the estimated due date, but as gestational
week at birth was comparable between groups, the dif-
ference in the rate of labour induction could again be
related to clinic-specific procedures. Differences in
hypertension cannot be attributed to the intervention
programme since blood pressure measurement proce-
dures may differ between the single practices. Another
difference
between
groups
was
the
proportion
of
women with preterm labour, which was slightly higher
in the control group. This parameter was evaluated as a
safety control in order to ensure that encouraging
women to engage in physical activity during pregnancy
would not lead to premature contractions. Thus, the
finding that the proportion of preterm labour was even
Kunath et al. BMC Medicine            (2019) 17:5 
Page 9 of 13
 lower in the intervention group supports the safety of
the physical activity component.
The intervention resulted in significant trends towards
a lower birth weight and lower birth length in the inter-
vention group. However, the estimated differences be-
tween groups were small. Overall, there is insufficient
evidence for an effect of lifestyle interventions in preg-
nancy on neonatal birth weight [23]. The observed dif-
ference in birth length in the intervention group may
explain the difference in birth weight. Nevertheless,
there were no significant differences regarding infants
born LGA, in line with the results of the LIMIT and UP-
BEAT trials, which also showed no effect of lifestyle ad-
vice on the number of infants born LGA [19, 21].
Similarly, the i-WIP consortium did not report any sig-
nificant effects for neonates including birth weight [22].
Despite the lack of observation of major effects from
the GeliS intervention on GWG or pregnancy complica-
tions, the trial has several strengths. A major advantage
is that counselling sessions could be scheduled in com-
bination with prenatal visits, resulting in both high par-
ticipation and low drop-out rates. The drop-out rate of
11% was lower than the expected rate of up to 20%,
reflecting the applicability of the programme and, indir-
ectly, the interest of women to participate in the lifestyle
programme; similar observations have been reported [46].
Moreover, the cluster-randomised design counteracted the
spill-over effects of lifestyle counselling content from
women in the intervention group to those in the control
group, which is a further strength of the GeliS trial. Add-
itionally, compared to available national data, the charac-
teristics of women participating in the GeliS study were
representative of the target population with respect to age,
pre-pregnancy BMI and smoking status.
However, there are a few limitations worth noting.
Women participating in the GeliS trial were predomin-
antly white and relatively well educated, with only a
small proportion from ethnic minorities. Therefore,
the results may not be completely applicable to the
general population of Germany. Moreover, the coun-
selling was not extensively based on concepts of be-
haviour change, with lifestyle counselling including
methods such as self-monitoring and feedback on be-
haviour. An extension with additional methods such as
motivational interviewing was not possible. As dis-
cussed by others, intervention programmes are often
initiated too late [20, 38]. The importance of imple-
menting an antenatal intervention early on should be
stressed since many women gain much weight in early
pregnancy and high early GWG is strongly predictive
not only of total excessive GWG [47], but also of
GDM [8]. In accordance with these findings, GeliS
counsellors were encouraged to include expectant
mothers as early as possible.
It is noteworthy that the large majority of previous
lifestyle intervention studies in pregnant women has
been performed by trained experts within academic
study centres, which poorly reflect real-life settings.
Controlled studies involving exercise groups, objective
monitoring of physical activity and continuous observa-
tion of dietary behaviour may be more likely to prevent
excessive GWG. However, there is an urgent need to
develop and evaluate effective strategies in real-life set-
tings of routine prenatal care in order to be applicable
at the population level. Apart from our pilot trial, of
the two identified studies integrating lifestyle interven-
tions into prenatal care [24, 25], only one was effective
in reducing GWG [25]. Although this study was inte-
grated into routine care, counselling was performed by
a qualified expert instead of trained medical personnel
as in the present study. This is in line with the results
of our pilot trial, supporting the effectiveness of lifestyle
counselling within routine care when performed by an
expert [27]. Unfortunately, the promising results ob-
served in our pilot study FeLIPO (excessive GWG IV:
38.2% vs. C: 59.5%) could not be confirmed through the
GeliS intervention, despite the comparability of the
GeliS trial in terms of trial setting and counselling content.
However, in the FeLIPO trial, counselling was provided by
a dietician, while trained medical personnel delivered the
sessions in the GeliS study, which may have substantially
contributed to the discrepancy of results.
Although counselling sessions in the GeliS trial were
conducted according to a predefined curriculum, differ-
ences in the quality of the delivered intervention are
the most likely explanation for the lack of effect on
GWG. Due to the specific characteristics of the study
designed as a public health approach, it was not pos-
sible to extensively monitor whether the sessions were
consistently performed by the counsellors as planned,
with only a sample of sessions being supervised by a
member of the study team. Indeed, the process evaluation
of this sample showed inconsistencies in the delivery of
counselling sessions. Not every lifestyle counsellor ad-
dressed all planned components of the intervention. In
particular, individual feedback based on personal dietary
and physical activity habits was not consistently given. To
date, the prenatal care provided by gynaecologists and
midwives does not include lifestyle advice, and mainly fo-
cuses on foetal growth parameters and maternal and foetal
complications. Even though counsellors received specific
training prior to the intervention sessions and reported
feeling adequately trained, a 2-day seminar may not be
enough to qualify gynaecologists, medical assistants and
midwives as specialists with sufficient expertise for high-
quality lifestyle coaching.
A further contributor to the missing effect could be
the general issue of scale-up of intervention studies
Kunath et al. BMC Medicine            (2019) 17:5 
Page 10 of 13
 following a promising pilot phase [24, 48, 49]. Imple-
menting successful interventions in health care systems
remains a challenge [48, 49]. Finally, the lack of statis-
tical differences in study outcomes between the inter-
vention and control groups may be attributed to
increased awareness of a healthy lifestyle and behaviour
change during pregnancy among women in the control
group following reading of the study material and ques-
tionnaires on dietary behaviour and physical activity.
Implementing a lifestyle programme into daily work
and combining counselling sessions with routine care
visits remains a challenge. Therefore, collaboration be-
tween medical practices and specially trained and expe-
rienced dieticians or lifestyle coaches could lead to an
improvement in the quality of lifestyle counselling, and
may reduce the proportion of women with excessive
GWG and associated health consequences. Addition-
ally, ensuring an appropriate environment, such as a
separate room designated for counselling patients, ra-
ther than conducting sessions in a busy practice office,
could contribute to increased quality of the lifestyle
intervention. Finally, a more extensive intervention
programme comprising more than four counselling ses-
sions may be more successful in promoting significant
lifestyle changes.
Conclusions
In the setting of routine prenatal care, lifestyle advice
given by trained healthcare providers was not success-
ful
in
limiting
GWG.
Nevertheless,
the
potential
long-term effects of the intervention remain to be seen.
Analysis of dietary behaviour and physical activity will
provide further insights into the adherence of study
participants to lifestyle advice and their relation to
health outcomes, and may highlight certain compo-
nents of the counselling content that may be empha-
sised in future trials. A follow-up observation until the
fifth year of life will extensively evaluate further weight
development as well as the long-term health of mothers
and their infants.
