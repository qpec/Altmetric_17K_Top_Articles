Introduction
Diabetes affects 6-9% of pregnancies with approximately 
99% of women having gestational diabetes, 0.5% having 
type 2 diabetes, and 0.3% having type 1 diabetes.1-4 In 
particular, the prevalence of gestational diabetes varies 
by population and diagnostic criteria.5 The prevalence of 
both gestational and pregestational diabetes is increas-
ing, likely owing to the increasing obesity rates.2 3 6 7 All 
types of diabetes are associated with increased risk for 
hypertensive disorders of pregnancy, excessive fetal 
growth, fetal demise, macrosomia, and neonatal morbid-
ity, along with long term risks for obesity and diabetes 
in the offspring.8 9 Unique to pregestational diabetes is 
the risk for early pregnancy loss and congenital anoma-
lies, which is directly linked to periconception glycemic 
control.
The goal of diabetes treatment in pregnancy is to mini-
mize maternal and fetal adverse events related to hyper-
glycemia. Physiologic changes of pregnancy include 
progressive increases in insulin resistance, weight gain, 
and changes in body composition, and each of these 
changes may affect the pharmacologic properties of dia-
betes treatment (fig 1). Treatment options vary by type 
of diabetes, but given the considerable overlap we have 
organized our review by treatment, summarizing est-
ablished treatment strategies and highlighting novel

ABSTRACT
Diabetes is a common complication of pregnancy, and the prevalence of all types of 
the disease is increasing worldwide. Diabetes in pregnancy is associated with short 
term and long term adverse effects for mother and child. The goal of treatment of 
diabetes in pregnancy is to minimize maternal and fetal adverse events related to 
hyperglycemia. Treatment options vary by type of diabetes, from a focus on lifestyle 
modifications in gestational diabetes to continuous glucose monitoring and insulin 
pumps in pregestational diabetes. Nevertheless, given the commonality of hyper-
glycemia, considerable overlap exists in the treatment of different types of diabetes 
in pregnancy. Also, despite ongoing research on treatment of diabetes in pregnancy 
for decades, changes in the characteristics of the patient population have high-
lighted the limited effectiveness of different therapies. Specifically, despite the co-
occurrence of obesity and diabetes, treatment recommendations including glycemic 
targets are not altered in such cases and a single optimal treatment strategy for each 
type of diabetes in pregnancy does not seem to exist. Rather, the approach to treat-
ing pregnant women with diabetes likely needs to be individualized to maximize the 
short term and long term health of mother and child. This article will review recent 
clinical studies to summarize established treatment strategies and introduce novel 
therapies for diabetes in pregnancy.

potential teratogenic effects. Preconception counseling 
may also be useful in women at high risk for gestational 
diabetes, including those who are overweight or obese, 
have a history of previous gestational diabetes, have 
a strong family history of diabetes, or have impaired 
glucose tolerance (fig 3). One challenge is that many 
pregnancies are unplanned, and novel interventions to 
encourage family planning efforts in women with diabe-
tes are urgently needed.
Lifestyle modifications
Lifestyle modifications including diet, exercise, and 
weight management are first line treatment in women 
with gestational diabetes and important adjuncts to 
drug therapy in pregestational diabetes (fig 3). Weight 
gain recommendations are based on the Institute of Medi-
cine’s guidelines for weight gain during pregnancy, which 
account for maternal body mass index but are unchanged 
by a diagnosis of diabetes in pregnancy.11 Exercise may 
improve glucose tolerance during pregnancy in women 
with gestational diabetes, and the ACOG and ADA have 
endorsed exercise as a helpful adjunct therapy in the 
treatment of diabetes.1 3 4
Between a third and a half of women with gestational 
diabetes are able to achieve glycemic control with diet 
alone,12 but the optimal diet in pregnant women with dia-
betes is debated. The ACOG and the Endocrine Society 
support a low carbohydrate diet, whereas the ADA and 
the Fifth International Workshop on Gestational Diabe-
tes have withdrawn specific recommendations on diet 
or macronutrients for women with diabetes because of 
the absence of adequate RCTs.3 4 13 14 A diet low in simple 
carbohydrates (33-40% of calories) is thought to limit 
postprandial glucose excursions and the associated risk 
of excessive fetal growth.15 However, this approach neces-
sitates an increase in dietary fat,15 which may promote 
insulin resistance in humans and has resulted in adipos-
ity, hepatic steatosis, and metabolic syndrome in off-
spring in animal models.16 Maternal triglyceride and free 
fatty acid concentrations are strong predictors of excess 
fetal fat accretion, so a low carbohydrate, higher fat diet 
may have unintended consequences on fetal health.17-19
Recent RCTs in women with gestational diabetes sug-
gest that a diet higher in complex carbohydrate and fiber, 
low in simple sugar (low glycemic index), and lower in 
saturated fat may be effective in blunting postprandial 
hyperglycemia, preventing worsened maternal insulin 
resistance and excess fetal growth.20 21 In a recent crosso-
ver pilot study, 16 pregnant women with gestational dia-
betes were randomized to a higher complex carbohydrate 
(60%), lower fat (25%) diet or a conventional low carbo-
hydrate (40% of calories), higher fat (45% of calories) 
diet at the time of diagnosis.22 The higher carbohydrate 
diet resulted in a slightly higher (by 6%; P=0.02), but well 
below current glycemic targets, area under the curve for 
24 hour glucose. However, in a separate pilot study of 
12 women with gestational diabetes who followed the 
complex carbohydrate and fiber diet for seven weeks, 
postprandial free fatty acids were 20% lower (P=0.06) 
and measures of maternal insulin resistance and infant 
adiposity were improved, although these differences 
Groups (IADPSG), the National Institute for Health and 
Care Excellence (NICE), the Endocrine Society, and the 
American Diabetes Association (ADA). We prioritized the 
results of guidelines in this review for quality according 
to the method outlined by the United States Preventive 
Services Task Force.
Preconception care
In women with pregestational diabetes, preconception 
care includes optimizing glycemic control before concep-
tion with a hemoglobin A1c goal of 6.5% (48 mmol/mol) 
to minimize the risk of congenital anomalies (fig 2).1 3 10 
Preconception counseling visits can also include assess-
ment for comorbidities and a review of drugs to discuss

for pregnant women with pre-existing diabetes who 
are using insulin pumps or basal-bolus therapy.1 3 4 10 
Although HbA1c assessment is less burdensome than fre-
quent daily testing, it is considered a secondary measure 
of glycemic control in pregnancy because A1c concentra-
tions fall during normal pregnancy owing to red blood 
cell turnover and HbA1c does not reflect variability in 
glucose concentration.1 3 10
Continuous glucose monitoring (CGM) technology was 
assessed in the CONCEPTT study, which randomized 325 
pregnant women with type 1 diabetes to real time CGM 
or capillary glucose monitoring.24 Real time CGM users 
were not sugnificant.23 These findings suggest a possi-
ble benefit of eating more complex carbohydrates and 
less fat. However, more definitive studies are needed to 
better define the optimal diet for pregnant women with 
diabetes, especially in obese women and in women with 
pregestational diabetes.
Glucose monitoring
Blood glucose monitoring is a cornerstone of diabetes 
management in pregnancy. Fasting and postprandial 
blood glucose monitoring is recommended in all type of 
diabetes, and preprandial testing is also recommended

without diabetes, mean fasting (70.9 (SD 7.8) mg/dL (3.9 
(0.4) mmol/L)) and one hour postprandial (108.9 (12.9) 
mg/dL (6.1 (0.7) mmol/L)) blood sugars as assessed by 
continuous glucose monitoring (CGM) were significantly 
lower than the current fasting (<95 mg/dL (5.3 mmol/L)) 
and one hour postprandial (<140 mg/dL (7.8 mmol/L)) 
glucose targets in pregnancies with diabetes, suggest-
ing that current glycemic targets may be too high.34 In 
particular, obese women with gestational diabetes are at 
higher risk for adverse pregnancy outcomes than their 
normal weight counterparts,35 and obese women also 
have higher mean fasting and postprandial blood sugars 
despite higher doses and more frequent use of drugs.12 In 
a retrospective cohort of 1344 women with gestational 
diabetes, obese women who had fasting blood glucose 
above 88.7 mg/dL (4.9 mmol/L) or one hour postprandial 
blood glucose above 123.8 mg/dL (6.9 mmol/L) were at 
the highest risk for macrosomia, suggesting that tighter 
glycemic control could help to optimize outcomes in 
this high risk population.12 Lower glycemic targets may 
require more intensive dietary modification and both ear-
lier and more aggressive dosing of drugs. This is the basis 
for ongoing studies such as the GDM-MOMS study, which 
is randomizing overweight and obese women with gesta-
tional diabetes to either standard glycemic targets (fasting 
<95 mg/dL (5.3 mmol/L), one hour postprandial <140 
mg/dL (7.8 mmol/L)) or more intensive glycemic control 
(fasting <90 mg/dL (5 mmol/L), one hour postprandial 
<120 mg/dL (6.9 mmol/L)) and is expected to report in 
early 2009 (NCT02530866).
Insulin
Insulin is the preferred treatment for pregestational dia-
betes in pregnancy, and several professional societies 
endorse it as a first line therapy in gestational diabe-
tes.3 4 The type of insulin, timing of administration, and 
frequency are based on individual glycemic patterns. In 
women with pregestational diabetes, insulin is tradition-
ally administered through multiple daily injections (MDI) 
combining short acting insulin for mealtime excursion 
and long acting insulin for basal glycemic control. The 
safety and efficacy of long acting analogs such as glargine 
and detemir have been demonstrated in pregnancy.36-39 
Although commonly used, most insulin analogs have not 
been specifically tested in women with gestational dia-
betes, and few studies provide data specific to this popu-
lation. A comprehensive discussion of different insulin 
formulations is beyond the scope of this review, and we 
will limit the discussion to an overview of established for-
mulations followed by a focus on novel therapies. Data 
are lacking on newer insulin analogs, with no published 
reports on the use of Toujeo, Lispro-U200, or Basalgar 
in pregnancy at the time of writing and a single report 
of two pregnancies treated with degludec from the first 
trimester of pregnancy.40 No malformations were seen 
in the infants, but both needed admission to NICU due 
to hypoglycemia.40 Given the lack of data, use of newer 
insulin analogs in pregnancy should be further explored.
Recent technological advances have resulted in a pro-
grammable pump device that can manipulate the tim-
ing, quantity, and type of insulin through a continuous 
spent more time in target (68% v 61%; P=0.003) and 
had less hyperglycemia (27% v 32%; P=0.028) between 
randomization and 34 weeks’ gestation.24 CGM use was 
also associated with an approximately 50% reduction in 
large for gestational age (LGA) births (odds ratio 0.50, 
95% confidence interval 0.28 to 0.90), admission to a 
neonatal intensive care unit (NICU) (0.48, 0.26 to 0.86), 
and neonatal hypoglycemia (0.45, 0.22 to 0.89).24
In addition, an RCT that assigned 340 women with ges-
tational diabetes to either self monitored glucose or self 
monitored glucose plus intermittent CGM use found that 
CGM use was associated with lower mean birth weight 
(3138 (SD 484) v 3345 (508) g; P<0.001), less macroso-
mia (4.1% v 10.8%; P=0.03), less pre-eclampsia (3.4% 
v 10.1%; P=0.02), and fewer primary cesarean deliver-
ies (34.7% v 46.6%; P=0.03).25 By comparison, a recent 
multicenter RCT found no significant difference in the risk 
of macrosomia between CGM and self monitored glucose 
in 300 pregnant women with gestational diabetes and 
pregestational diabetes.26
More recent trials published in the past two years have 
focused on devices that use flash glucose monitoring 
(FGM) technology, which can be worn for a period of 
time; users can obtain glucose measurements instantly by 
scanning the glucose sensor with the reader, producing 
real time data. Studies on the efficacy of FGM are limited 
to non-pregnant adults. Two RCTs, one including 328 
adults with type 1 diabetes and another in 224 adults 
with type 2 diabetes, compared FGM with self monitor-
ing of blood glucose for six months. Both found that FGM 
was associated with reduced rates of hypoglycemia (in 
type 1 diabetes, time in hypoglycemia reduced by 0.14 
hours on average per day (P<0.001); in type 2 diabetes, by 
0.70 hours on average per day P<0.001) and high patient 
satisfaction based on few adverse events attributed to 
the device.27 28 However, in a pilot RCT in 40 adults with 
type 1 diabetes and a history of severe hypoglycemia or 
impaired awareness of glycemia, real time CGM use was 
associated with less time spent below 59.4 mg/dL (3.3 
mmol/L) compared with FGM (2.4% v 6.8%; P=0.006).29
Studies on FGM use in pregnancy are limited to a sin-
gle case report and a published abstract that noted good 
agreement between FGM and capillary glucose monitor-
ing in 74 pregnant women (24 with type 1 diabetes, 11 
with type 2 diabetes, and 39 with gestational diabetes).30 
Further studies are needed to assess the utility of FGM 
in pregnancy, but this technology has appeal given the 
frequency of blood glucose monitoring in pregnancy.
Optimal glycemic targets
Fetal adiposity is strongly associated with elevated mater-
nal glucose, and approximately 15-20% of pregnant 
women with diabetes whose glucose targets are within 
current clinical targets still deliver macrosomic infants 
who are at increased risk for long term metabolic dys-
function.31-33
The Hyperglycemia and Pregnancy Outcomes (HAPO) 
study better defined the relation between maternal gly-
cemia and fetal overgrowth, but current pregnancy gly-
cemic targets have not been rigorously defined or tested 
in RCTs. In an observational study in pregnant women

as 13 of the 16 newborns in the study cohort had a birth 
weight greater than the 90th centile.47
Two recent systematic reviews found no evidence to 
recommend one type of insulin or insulin regimen over 
another or continuous glucose monitoring over intermit-
tent monitoring.48 49 Although the findings from CON-
CEPTT are encouraging, and despite the advances in CSII 
and CGM, rates of adverse pregnancy outcomes remain 
high in women with type 1 diabetes. Further studies are 
needed to explore combining CSII and CGM with other 
treatment modalities to further reduce maternal and fetal 
risks.
Metformin
Metformin is a biguanide that decreases hepatic glucose 
output, decreases intestinal glucose absorption, and 
increases peripheral glucose uptake in muscles and adi-
pocyte cells.50 Metformin is a hydrophilic compound with 
low molecular weight and low binding capacity to plasma 
proteins, and trans-placental passage occurs in a dose 
dependent manner that is most likely carrier dependent.51 
Observational studies have shown that concentrations 
of metformin in cord blood range from 50% to 100% of 
maternal concentrations, and fetal concentrations may 
even be higher than maternal concentrations.52-54 Met-
formin does not seem to affect human placental glucose 
uptake or transport.55
Metformin to treat diabetes in pregnancy
Table 2 provides a summary of studies that have compared 
metformin with either insulin or glyburide. The MiG study 
remains the largest RCT comparing metformin plus insulin 
if needed with insulin alone, and this study has played an 
important role in recent recommendations that metformin 
can be considered as an acceptable alternative to insulin 
for treatment of gestational diabetes.56 We will discuss the 
data that led to these recommendations and the ongoing 
concerns about use of metformin in pregnancy.
In the MiG trial, glycemic control was similar between 
the two groups, but 46% of women in the metformin 
group needed supplemental insulin.56 Rates of neonatal 
composite morbidity were similar between groups, but 
metformin treatment was associated with fewer instances 
of severe neonatal hypoglycemia.56 In contrast, met-
formin was associated with more preterm birth (12.1% v 
7.6%; P=0.04).56 It was also associated with less weight 
gain between study enrollment and 36-37 weeks’ gesta-
tion (0.4 (SD 2.9) kg in the metformin group versus 2.0 
(3.3) kg in the insulin group; P<0.001).56 Importantly, 
metformin had good patient acceptability, with 76.6% of 
women suggesting that they would choose metformin in a 
subsequent pregnancy compared with 27.2% of women 
assigned to insulin who would choose that.56
Several systematic reviews and meta-analyses have 
compared outcomes between women treated with met-
formin and either insulin or glyburide. These meta-anal-
yses have reached disparate conclusions, likely owing to 
their varied approaches and whether unpublished studies 
or those also enrolling women with type 2 diabetes were 
included. The systematic review by Balsells et al found 
that metformin was associated with less maternal weight 
subcutaneous insulin infusion (CSII). These devices can 
be programmed to provide varying basal and bolus con-
centrations of insulin at differing times during the day, 
without abrupt changes and additional injections. Out-
side of pregnancy, the benefits of CSII compared with MDI 
include lower hemoglobin A1c levels, reduced variation 
and blood glucose concentrations, fewer hypoglycemic 
episodes, reduction in total daily insulin dose, and more 
flexibility of lifestyle.41 However, the value of CSII in 
improving pregnancy outcomes remains unclear.42-44
A retrospective study assessed two comparable groups 
of women with type 1 diabetes, of whom 100 were using 
CSII and 44 were using MDI. Metabolic control deter-
mined by HbA1c measurements every trimester improved 
during pregnancy in both groups, but control was 
achieved earlier (second trimester compared with end of 
pregnancy) among participants using CSII.45 At parturi-
tion, patients using CSII had lower HbA1c levels (6.2% 
(SD 0.7%) v 6.5 (0.8%) (44 v 48 mmol/mol); P=0.02) 
and needed less insulin (P<0.01). However, maternal 
and neonatal outcomes did not differ.44 Similar find-
ings of improved HbA1c levels with CSII versus MDI were 
reported in a case-control study in 99 pregnant women 
with diabetes, again with no differences in maternal or 
neonatal outcomes.46 A recent systematic review of six 
RCTs that compared the use of multiple daily insulin 
with CSII in 213 pregnant women found no significant 
differences between groups, including the frequency of 
maternal (odds ratio 1.35, 95% confidence interval 0.60 
to 3.03) and neonatal hypoglycemia (1.31, 0.59 to 2.94) 
and the rates of preterm birth (1.29, 0.45 to 3.71), cesar-
ean delivery (1.39, 0.76 to 2.55), stillbirth (2.5, 0.53 to 
11.77), and LGA infants (1.04, 0.36 to 3.01).43
Subsequent studies have focused on the combination 
of CSII with CGM. The CONCEPTT study, described earlier, 
stratified women by insulin delivery (CSII or MDI) and 
found that CGM reduced hyperglycemia, limited glycemic 
variability, and improved HbA1c levels for CSII and MDI 
users.24 Also, sensor augmented insulin pumps have been 
developed to integrate real time CGM and insulin pump 
technologies. A proof of principle crossover trial was 
performed in 16 pregnant women with type 1 diabetes.47 
Women were randomly assigned for a four week period 
to using a CSII pump and a continuous glucose sensor 
with or without tablet computer software that automati-
cally adjusted the pump basal insulin rate at night. After 
four weeks, they switched to the other treatment group.47 
Closed loop therapy resulted in a higher percentage of 
time in the designated euglycemic range (63-140 mg/dL

formin to insulin reduced the risk of neonatal hypoglyce-
mia.60 Several ongoing RCTs comparing metformin with 
placebo in women with either type 2 diabetes or early 
onset gestational diabetes receiving insulin (Medical 
Optimization of Management of Type 2 Diabetes Com-
plicating Pregnancy (MOMPOD), NCT02932475; and 
Metformin in Women With Type 2 Diabetes in Pregnancy 
Trial (MiTy), NCT01353391) will provide useful informa-
tion on the effect of metformin as adjuvant therapy in 
this population, particularly with regard to the possible 
reduction in pre-eclampsia rates.67
Metformin use in women without gestational diabetes
Several studies in obese women without diabetes have 
explored the use of metformin to decrease the risk of fetal 
overgrowth. The EmPOWaR study by Chiswick and col-
leagues randomized 449 obese pregnant women with 
normal glucose tolerance to either metformin or placebo 
and found no significant difference in birthweight cen-
tile between groups.62 Metformin was also evaluated 
in a study of 400 obese women (body mass index >35) 
without diabetes who were randomized to metformin or 
placebo. Metformin did not affect birthweight Z scores, 
but it was associated with less maternal weight gain and 
a lower prevalence of pre-eclampsia.63 Metformin lowers 
soluble fms-like tyrosine kinase 1 and soluble endoglin 
secretion from primary human tissues. It may also reduce 
endothelial dysfunction, increase vasodilation, and 
induce angiogenesis, all of which show biologic plausi-
bility that metformin could have the potential to prevent 
or treat pre-eclamspia.62
Potential long term effect of metformin on offspring
In addition to its glucose lowering properties, metformin 
inhibits proliferation of cancer cells by suppressing the 
production of mitochondrial dependent metabolic inter-
mediates needed for cell growth, and it also causes down-
gain, improved postprandial glycemic control, and fewer 
cases of severe neonatal hypoglycemia but more preterm 
birth.57 In contrast, a recent network meta-analysis that 
included nine published and unpublished trials found 
that the risk of most outcomes, including LGA (relative 
risk 0.80, 95% confidence interval 0.64 to 0.99), mac-
rosomia (0.75, 0.57 to 0.98), admission to NICU (0.74, 
0.57 to 0.97), neonatal hypoglycemia (0.68, 0.50 to 
0.92), and pre-eclampsia (0.56, 0.37 to 0.85), was lower 
in women randomized to metformin compared with insu-
lin.58 There authors did not find a difference in preterm 
delivery (relative risk 1.37, 0.62 to 3.01) and concluded 
that metformin had the highest probability of being the 
most effective treatment when compared with insulin 
or glyburide.58 Another meta-analysis that included 
16 studies of women with gestational diabetes or type 
2 diabetes found no differences in the rates of preterm 
delivery (relative risk 1.18, 0.67 to 2.07).59 Although the 
most common focus in gestational diabetes is the risk of 
fetal overgrowth, the risk of increased preterm birth with 
metformin has not been resolved, and preterm birth is 
also associated with long term health consequences.64 65 
The high rate of failure with metformin has raised ques-
tions about appropriate dosing of metformin during preg-
nancy, and the increased renal clearance of metformin 
may necessitate dosing modifications.53 66
Metformin use is common in gestational diabetes, but 
limited data exist regarding its use to treat type 2 diabe-
tes in pregnancy. The study by Ainuddin and colleagues 
that used metformin to treat type 2 diabetes found that 
a significant proportion of women needed insulin, but 
metformin use was associated with less maternal insulin 
use and lower weight gain.61 Metformin was associated 
with fewer hypertensive disorders of pregnancy but more 
small for gestational age infants.61 An additional study 
by Ibrahim and colleagues of 90 women with gestational 
diabetes or type 2 diabetes found that the addition of met-

follow-up data from 4 year old offspring of women with 
polycystic ovarian syndrome who were randomized to 
metformin or placebo showed that antenatal exposure to 
metformin resulted in higher weight and body mass index 
Z scores in the offspring, and there were more overweight 
and obese children in the group exposed to metformin.74
Glyburide
Sulfonylureas are insulin secretagogs that bind to the 
sulfonylurea receptor 1 (SUR1) of ATP sensitive K+ chan-
nels of pancreatic β cells, which causes channel closure 
and results in increased insulin secretion.75 Glyburide is 
hepatically metabolized and effluxed from the fetal to the 
maternal compartment against a concentration gradient 
by placental breast cancer resistance protein.76
Glyburide to treat diabetes in pregnancy
Glyburide is predominantly used to treat women with 
gestational diabetes. The largest trial evaluating use of 
glyburide randomized 404 women with gestational dia-
betes to insulin or glyburide and found similar glycemic 
control and neonatal outcomes for the two treatments 
(table 3).79 One additional benefit was that only 4% of the 
women who were treated with glyburide needed supple-
mental insulin. Although recent studies have shown that 
concentrations of glyburide in cord blood are 50-70% of 
maternal concentrations,76 87 at the time of the above 
study glyburide transplacental transfer was thought to be 
minimal.79 88 Likely as a result of these findings, glyburide 
treatment in women with gestational diabetes dramati-
cally increased from 7% to 65% over the time period from 
2000 to 2011.89
modulation of cell proliferation related proteins through 
activation of AMPK and a decrease in mTOR.68 69 These 
actions of metformin have raised interest in the poten-
tial short and long term effects of metformin on fetal 
and childhood development. In a follow-up of the MiG 
study, children aged 2 years whose mothers were treated 
with metformin had significantly higher mid-upper arm 
circumferences (17.2 (SD 1.5) v 16.7 (1.5) cm; P=0.002) 
and higher subscapular (6.3 (1.9) v 6.0 (1.7) mm; P=0.02) 
and biceps skinfolds (6.0 (1.9) v 5.6 (1.7) mm; P=0.04) 
compared with infants whose mothers were treated with 
insulin alone.70 However, no differences were seen in total 
fat mass, percentage body fat, or waist circumference. The 
authors speculated that metformin resulted in a more 
favorable fat redistribution with more peripheral fat and 
less visceral fat, but others have pointed out that only a 
subset of children underwent DEXA testing and there were 
no differences in waist circumference between groups.70 71 
Longer term follow-up data are pending for these children.
Another follow-up of 211 children from the MiG study 
found no significant differences in neurodevelopmental 
and psychomotor outcomes between those who were or 
were not exposed to metformin.72 Follow-up of a small 
Finnish RCT comparing metformin and insulin found 
that children exposed to metformin in pregnancy were 
significantly heavier (10.47 (SD 1.49) v 9.85 (1.26) kg; 
P=0.038) at 12 months and taller and heavier (12.05 
(1.87) v 11.32 (1.45) kg; P=0.04) at 18 months despite 
having similar birth weights.73 No differences existed 
in motor, social, or linguistic development at 18 weeks 
between the two groups, although the study was small 
with only 93 children.73 Importantly, recently published

also be related to changes in drug metabolism, and the 
dosing used in some studies may not be ideal. During 
pregnancy, glyburide concentrations increase within 
30-60 minutes, peak in two to three hours, and return 
to baseline by eight hours.87 These data identify several 
considerations for glyburide dosing. Firstly, glyburide 
concentrations return to baseline within eight to 10 hours 
of ingestion, so a pre-breakfast dose may not provide an 
adequate insulin response for dinner.94 All of the glybur-
ide studies used either once or twice daily dosing, but 
this could lead to inadequate glycemic control because 
increasing the morning dose to control post-dinner 
blood sugars may result in hypoglycemia earlier in the 
day. Secondly, glyburide should be administered 30-60 
minutes before a meal to ensure that glyburide concen-
trations increase before the rise in blood sugar seen after 
a meal.94 In addition, plasma concentrations of glybur-
ide are lower in pregnancy than in the non-pregnancy 
state.87 Such findings suggest a possible need to change 
the dosing and administration schedule for glyburide in 
pregnant women with diabetes to maximize the efficacy 
of treatment.
Potential long term effect of glyburide on offspring
One important concern regarding glyburide use is the 
lack of long term follow-up data on children who were 
exposed to glyburide in utero, and these concerns have 
become more pressing with the knowledge that glybur-
ide crosses the placenta. Recent data suggest that gly-
buride may also increase placental GLUT1 expression, 
which could augment fetal glucose delivery.95 Whether 
glyburide use increases the risk of fetal overgrowth inde-
pendently of glycemic control is unclear, but LGA birth 
weight is thought to be a risk factor for adverse childhood 
metabolic outcomes.96 97 Hypothetical concerns also exist 
about long term β cell function in offspring exposed to 
glyburide in utero, highlighting the importance of long 
term studies of growth and metabolism in offspring.
Glyburide versus metformin
Several small studies have compared glyburide with 
metformin. The meta-analysis by Balsells et al compared 
glyburide with metformin,57 but it included only two stud-
ies.80 81 It found that metformin was associated with less 
maternal weight gain, lower birth weight, less macroso-
mia, and fewer LGA births.57 Preterm birth was increased 
in women who were treated with metformin. In contrast, 
a recent systematic review compared outcomes between 
women randomized to either glyburide or metformin from 
several additional studies and found no differences in 
maternal or neonatal outcomes.86 The authors noted that 
most of the studies comparing glyburide with metformin 
were of moderate to low quality, and they also stressed 
that the benefits and potential harms of one oral antidia-
betic drug therapy compared with another are unclear.
Finally, a recent RCT of 104 women took a novel 
approach and randomized patients to either glyburide 
or metformin and then added the other drug if control was 
inadequate.82 Treatment failure after first line treatment 
because of poor glycemic control or adverse effects was 
similar between glyburide and metformin (34% v 29%; 
The increased prevalence of glyburide use has 
prompted multiple additional observational and ran-
domized clinical trials comparing outcomes in women 
treated with glyburide with those treated with insulin. In 
one “natural experiment” that arose in a US healthcare 
system, the authors compared outcomes in 236 women 
treated with glyburide with those in 268 historical con-
trols treated with insulin.77 More women in the glybur-
ide group achieved treatment goals, and no differences 
were seen in birth weight or macrosomia.77 Glyburide was 
associated with higher rates of pre-eclampsia and need 
for phototherapy in infants, but fewer infants from the 
glyburide group were admitted to NICU.77 In contrast, 
a retrospective cohort study comparing outcomes in 
4982 women treated with glyburide and 4191 women 
treated with insulin found that glyburide treatment was 
associated with increased risk of NICU admission, res-
piratory distress, hypoglycemia, birth injury, and LGA 
birth weight.78 This study was limited by the lack of 
information on glycemic control or maternal body mass 
index. However, these data raised important questions 
about whether the differences in outcomes between 
women treated with glyburide and insulin were related 
to unmeasured confounding or whether glyburide use 
outside of a small, tightly regulated clinical trial was 
associated with adverse perinatal outcomes due to either 
suboptimal glycemic control or direct effects of the drug.
Several recent meta-analyses have also looked at out-
comes in women treated with glyburide compared with 
insulin.80 83-85 The meta-analysis by Balsells et al found 
that women treated with glyburide had higher birth-
weight infants, more macrosomia, and more neonatal 
hypoglycemia than those treated with insulin.57 The 
average rate of treatment failure among women treated 
with glyburide was 6.4%. Both the observational stud-
ies and meta-analyses of RCTs raise questions about the 
appropriate use of glyburide. The largest trial to date 
suggests that as long as glycemic control is comparable, 
outcomes are also similar between groups.79 The other 
trials included in these meta-analyses have small sample 
sizes and differ in their approach to glyburide dosing. In 
addition, the observational studies showing increased 
risk have methodological concerns including an inability 
to account for the level of glycemic control. Beyond gesta-
tional diabetes, data on the use of glyburide to treat type 2 
diabetes in pregnancy are scarce, but this is one potential 
novel aspect of glyburide use. In one small cohort study, 
outcomes were similar between women treated with oral 
hypoglycemic agents (primarily glyburide) and insu-
lin, with less weight gain and similar glycemic control 
between those receiving oral agents and insulin.90
Controversies in glyburide dosing
Several factors have been associated with a higher rate of 
failure of glyburide treatment, including a fasting plasma 
glucose above 110 mg/dL (6.1 mmol/L) on the oral glu-
cose tolerance test, older maternal age, multiparity, and 
diagnosis of gestational diabetes before 25 weeks, but 
data to ensure that providers can select the most appro-
priate candidates or dosing regimens for glyburide use 
are limited.91-93 Efficacy of glyburide in pregnancy may

mostly in women with gestational diabetes. Nutrient 
supplements such as myo-inositol are also being tested 
to decrease the risk of adverse pregnancy outcomes in 
women with gestational diabetes. Myo-inositol is hypoth-
esized to act through complex pathways that ultimately 
shift glucose intracellularly and then into fatty acids 
synthesis.102 103 Myo-inositol supplementation starting 
at 12-13 weeks of pregnancy decreased the likelihood 
of gestational diabetes in at risk groups such as obese 
women and those with polycystic ovarian syndrome.104-106 
Trials in women with other risk factors for gestational dia-
betes showed mixed results, with a recent trial showing 
no effect of myo-inositol supplementation in pregnant 
women with a family history of diabetes.107 Furthermore, 
evidence in support of myo-inositol as a treatment for 
gestational diabetes is weak,108 but it is the subject of a 
current investigation (NCT02149992).
Outside of pregnancy, obstructive sleep apnea (OSA) 
has been linked to enhanced inflammatory and oxida-
tive stress responses, endothelial damage, and metabolic 
derangements.109 110 Given the overlap between these bio-
logic pathways and adverse pregnancy outcomes, includ-
ing gestational diabetes, recent studies have focused on 
evaluating the link between OSA and adverse pregnancy 
outcomes. Rates of OSA increase with advancing gesta-
tion and may be even higher in women with gestational 
diabetes.111 112 OSA was independently associated with 
gestational diabetes (odds ratio 3.47, 1.95 to 6.19) after 
adjustment for age, body mass index, chronic hyperten-
sion, and gestational weight gain.111 The study also noted 
an increasing exposure-response relation between OSA 
and gestational diabetes.111 Also, in women with ges-
tational diabetes, short sleep duration was associated 
with worsened glucose control.113 These findings are the 
basis for a pilot study assessing the effect of continuous 
positive airway pressure treatment on glycemic control in 
gestational diabetes (NCT02245659).
Lastly, ongoing studies are exploring the relation 
between diabetes, obesity, and the gut microbiome. Evi-
dence that the gut microbiota might influence obesity 
began with the observation that sterile, germ-free mice 
have decreased capacity for energy utilization compared 
with colonized counterparts.114 Data suggest that patients 
with type 2 diabetes have a reduction in the Firmicutes 
phylum, and the ratio of Bacteroides to Firmicutes cor-
relates with plasma glucose concentrations.115 Kuang et 
al did a metagenome-wide association study comparing 
fecal samples collected at 21-29 weeks from 43 women 
with gestational diabetes and 81 healthy controls, and 
they found changes in microbial composition that could 
be used to identify women at risk of gestational diabe-
tes.116 Others found that the placental microbiota and 
microbiome differed between women with and without 
gestational diabetes.117 The stool microbiota of insulin 
resistant women with a history of gestational diabetes has 
been characterized postpartum, and women with former 
gestational diabetes had relatively higher abundance of 
the Prevotellaceae family as well as reduced abundance of 
Firmicutes, similar to the situation in type 2 diabetes.118 
Another cross sectional study of the gut microbiome in 
women who had gestational diabetes and their offspring 
P=0.6), and treatment success after second line therapy 
was higher in the metformin group than in the glyburide 
group (87% v 50%; P=0.03).82 More patients in the gly-
buride group ultimately needed insulin compared with 
those in the metformin group (17% v 4%; P=0.03). No dif-
ferences were seen in maternal weight gain, birth weight, 
LGA births, or macrosomia.82 However, a trend was seen 
toward more hypoglycemia in the metformin group. The 
authors concluded that the combination of glyburide 
and metformin may allow for a higher efficacy rate with 
a significantly reduced need for insulin, and they also 
postulated that the use of metformin first may have poten-
tiated the effect of glyburide when the latter was added.82 
However, further studies are needed to assess whether 
these drugs can be safely and efficaciously substituted for 
insulin and would require the combination to be directly 
compared with insulin alone. Using two drugs that cross 
the placenta to avoid insulin raises concerns about the 
potential long term programming effects of fetal hyperin-
sulinemia (glyburide) and altered hepatic gluconeogen-
esis, insulin sensitivity, mitochondrial function, and cell 
cycle proliferation (metformin).98
Alternate oral agents
α glucosidase inhibitors inhibit the α glucosidase 
enzymes present on the brush border of the small intes-
tine, which slows carbohydrate absorption and reduces 
postprandial glucose concentrations. Only acarbose has 
been studied in pregnancy. One small case series found 
that postprandial glucose values normalized and infants 
were healthy in six women treated with acarbose three 
times a day.99 Another small RCT conducted in Brazil 
compared insulin versus glyburide versus acarbose in 70 
patients.100 No significant differences in LGA and cesar-
ean delivery rates among the three groups were seen, but 
acarbose was associated with more gastrointestinal side 
effects.100
Several other agents including DPP4 inhibitors, GLP-1 
receptor agonists, SGLT-2 inhibitors, and thiazolidinedi-
ones are used outside of pregnancy, but minimal data are 
available in pregnancy. DPP-4 inhibitors reduce DPP-4 
mediated degradation of endogenous incretin hormones. 
This leads to enhanced insulin synthesis and secretion as 
well as suppressed glucagon secretion. GLP-1 receptor 
agonists activate the GLP-1 receptor and enhance insulin 
synthesis and secretion in a glucose dependent fashion. 
SGLT-2 inhibitors inhibit activity of glucose transporters 
in the proximal tubule, serving to increase renal glucose 
excretion. Thiazolidinediones activate the PPAR family 
of nuclear receptors and reduce insulin resistance. In 
a mouse model, exposure to rosiglitazone resulted in 
abnormal placental morphology and altered expression 
of proteins implicated in placental development, raising 
concerns about the therapeutic use of this class of drugs 
during pregnancy.101
Emerging treatments
More than 200 studies are listed on Clinicaltrials.gov 
under the heading of diabetes treatment in pregnancy. 
The studies primarily focus on glyburide, metformin, 
and insulin treatment to improve pregnancy outcomes,

differ, specifically regarding the use of oral agents. Both 
SMFM and NICE have endorsed the use of metformin as 
an alternative to insulin for treatment of gestational dia-
betes.10 124 However, we would argue that the available 
data on oral agents are limited, especially regarding long 
term effects after in utero exposure. Further research is 
needed to fully support the use of oral agents as alternates 
to insulin in gestational diabetes. All of the guidelines 
recognize that recommendations for the management of 
diabetes in pregnancy are largely based on studies with 
small sample sizes and less than level A evidence.
Conclusions
Diabetes in pregnancy has significant short and long term 
implications for affected mothers and their offspring. 
Despite decades of research, complications rates are high, 
particularly in pregestational diabetes, highlighting that 
novel interventions are urgently needed. Future studies 
are needed to clarify whether diets higher in complex 
carbohydrates and lower in fat are more effective than 
lower carbohydrate diets. Data on continuous subcu-
taneous insulin infusion suggest that this technology 
may improve outcomes in women with type 1 diabetes, 
and future studies are needed to assess whether it can 
improve outcomes in women with type 2 diabetes and 
even difficult to control gestational diabetes. Although 
oral agents are not novel, robust debate continues about 
the use of oral agents in gestational diabetes. We support 
insulin as first line treatment for gestational diabetes and 
hope that ongoing studies will clarify a potential role for 
metformin in the treatment of gestational diabetes and 
as an adjuvant to insulin in women with type 2 diabe-
tes. We would also suggest that the approach to clinical 
trials in gestational diabetes would benefit from more 
novel approaches. Studies on treatment of diabetes in 
pregnancy have followed a traditional “simple parallel 
arm” clinical trial design, but gestational diabetes is a 
disease with a heterogeneous physiology characterized 
by various levels of insulin resistance and insulin secre-
tion defects. Therapeutic studies outside of pregnancy 
five years postpartum found no significant differences in 
gut microbiota between women who had gestational dia-
betes and controls, but some differences existed between 
offspring of women who had gestational diabetes and 
those who did not.119
A few RCTs have examined the effects of probiotics 
administered during pregnancy with the aim of improv-
ing insulin sensitivity and reducing risk of gestational 
diabetes. In one RCT, pregnant women were randomized 
to either Bifidobacterium lactis alone or B lactis plus 
Lactobacillus rhamnosus GG (LGG) probiotic 14 days 
before a scheduled cesarean delivery.120 Both treatments 
decreased the expression of toll-like receptor genes in the 
placenta and meconium of neonates compared with pla-
cebo.120 A Finnish study randomized 256 women during 
the first trimester to dietary counseling and either a daily 
LGG and B lactis probiotic or placebo. Dietary counseling 
and probiotics decreased the frequency of gestational dia-
betes from 36% to 13%, but no significant differences 
in birth weight were seen.121 Of note, maternal central 
adiposity at six months postpartum was lower in women 
treated with diet and probiotics.121 In another RCT, 175 
obese pregnant women were assigned to receive either 
daily Lactobacillus salivarius probiotic or placebo from 
24 to 28 weeks’ gestation, and the probiotic did not affect 
maternal glycemia or birth weight.122
Guidelines
Guidelines for the management of diabetes in pregnancy 
include those from NICE, ACOG, ADA, and RANZCOG 
(table 4).1 3 4 10 123 All recommend treatment of all forms of 
diabetes in pregnancy to decrease adverse maternal and 
fetal outcomes. All agree that management of pregnancy 
complicated by diabetes should include medical nutri-
tional therapy, counseling, and increased frequency of 
glucose monitoring. Differences exist in specific glucose 
targets, including the goal for fasting glucose below 90 
mg/dL (5.0 mmol/L) by RANZCOG and a range of HbA1c 
goals of 6-7% for women with pregestational diabetes. 
Also, guidelines for treatment of gestational diabetes

RESEARCH QUESTIONS
• What diet in pregnant women with diabetes optimizes 
glycemic control and other metabolic characteristics and 
ultimately results in the most favorable fetal growth profile? 
• Are there different glycemic targets for subgroups of women 
with diabetes in pregnancy (for example, pregestational 
versus gestational diabetes or obese versus non-obese)?
• Are there alternative metabolic or nutritional targets in 
pregnant women with diabetes to minimize maternal and 
fetal adverse outcomes?
• What are the long term effects of diabetes treatment 
options, specifically oral hypoglycemic agents, on the 
offspring of pregnant women with diabetes?
