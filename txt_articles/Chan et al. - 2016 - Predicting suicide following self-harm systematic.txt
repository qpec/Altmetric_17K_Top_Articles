 Suicide and self-harm are major public health concerns, both in
the UK and internationally.1–4 Self-harm is one of the most
common reasons for hospital admission, and accounts for over
200 000 hospital attendances every year in England and Wales.5
People who have self-harmed are at much greater risk of future
episodes of self-harm and suicide than the general population.6
It has been estimated that one in six people will repeat self-harm
in the year after a hospital attendance .7 The risk of suicide is
elevated by between 30- and 100-fold in the year following self-
harm,6,8 and the risk persists: 1 in 15 people die by suicide within
9 years of the index episode.7 It has been suggested that multiple
repeat episodes of self-harm are associated with an even greater
suicide risk.9 A key priority for health service providers as well
as national governments, therefore, is to better identify those
individuals who are at high risk of suicide.10 Investigating the
utility of risk factors and risk scales in the prediction of suicide
is central to this endeavour.
Much of our understanding of the risk factors for repeated
self-harm and suicide is derived from individual studies of
variable quality and size. Moreover, reviews of the literature to
date have been either largely narrative, retrospective in nature11
or look at non-fatal outcomes.12 This raises concerns because
prospective cohort studies are more appropriate than retrospective
studies for identifying risk factors, and are less prone to bias.13 A
refinement of a simple ‘risk factor’ approach to assessment is to
incorporate individual factors into composite risk scales. These
scales are specifically designed to quantify the risk of later suicide
and are commonly used in clinical practice, leading clinicians to
classify people as being at low, medium or high risk. A wide
variety of risk assessment scales are currently used in different
health settings. For example, a recent study in 32 English hospitals
found that risk assessment scales were in widespread use, with
many services using locally developed instruments.14 The utility
of scales has seldom been investigated in a systematic manner.
A recent paper15 reviewed a number of risk scales, but the
researchers did not perform a meta-analysis because of the studies’
heterogeneity; they only considered a restricted number of scales
used in an emergency department and did not focus on suicide
as an outcome.
Drawing on the international research literature, this is the
first systematic review and meta-analysis of (a) prospective studies
examining the factors associated with suicide following self-harm
and (b) risk assessment scales predicting suicide in people who
have self-harmed or were under specialist mental healthcare.
We were keen to examine individual risk factors as well as
combinations of risk factors (in the form of scales) in this
paper. Both contribute to clinical assessments of risk in health
service settings. The current analyses were initially undertaken

Background
People with a history of self-harm are at a far greater risk
of suicide than the general population. However, the
relationship between self-harm and suicide is complex.
Aims
To undertake the first systematic review and meta-analysis
of prospective studies of risk factors and risk assessment
scales to predict suicide following self-harm.
Method
We conducted a search for prospective cohort studies
of populations who had self-harmed. For the review of
risk scales we also included studies examining the risk of
suicide in people under specialist mental healthcare, in
order to broaden the scope of the review and increase
the number of studies considered. Differences in predictive
accuracy between populations were examined where
applicable.
Results
Twelve studies on risk factors and 7 studies on risk scales
were included. Four risk factors emerged from the meta-
analysis, with robust effect sizes that showed little change
when adjusted for important potential confounders. These
included: previous episodes of self-harm (hazard ratio
(HR) = 1.68, 95% CI 1.38–2.05, K = 4), suicidal intent (HR = 2.7,
95% CI 1.91–3.81, K = 3), physical health problems (HR = 1.99,
95% CI 1.16–3.43, K = 3) and male gender (HR = 2.05, 95% CI
1.70–2.46, K = 5). The included studies evaluated only three
risk scales (Beck Hopelessness Scale (BHS), Suicide Intent
Scale (SIS) and Scale for Suicide Ideation). Where meta-
analyses were possible (BHS, SIS), the analysis was based on
sparse data and a high heterogeneity was observed. The
positive predictive values ranged from 1.3 to 16.7%.
Conclusions
The four risk factors that emerged, although of interest, are
unlikely to be of much practical use because they are
comparatively common in clinical populations. No scales
have sufficient evidence to support their use. The use of
these scales, or an over-reliance on the identification of risk
factors in clinical practice, may provide false reassurance
and is, therefore, potentially dangerous. Comprehensive
psychosocial assessments of the risks and needs that are
specific to the individual should be central to the
management of people who have self-harmed.

Method
Types of studies and search method
A search was conducted in Embase, MEDLINE, PsycINFO and
CINAHL, from their inception up to February 2014, for
English-language prospective cohort studies for inclusion in the
review of risk factors and risk scales. The use of prospective studies
provides some reassurance that the factors identified here are
those most robustly linked to later suicide. The searches formed
part of a wider search that was undertaken for the NICE guideline
on the longer-term management of self-harm16 and included
research articles published up to February 2014. Additional
articles were identified through discussion with the NICE
Guideline Development Group and from reference lists of relevant
studies, including grey literature. We also consulted experts in the
field during the consultation period of the guideline by emailing
them with a list of papers that had already been identified and
asking for any additional studies that had been omitted. Citations
from the searches were downloaded to the Reference Manager
software tool and duplicates were removed. Records were then
screened against the eligibility criteria of the review before being
appraised. Full details of the search strategies used for MEDLINE
are provided in online Table DS1. The PRISMA statement for this
study can be found in online supplement DS1.
Inclusion criteria
Population: risk factors and risk scales
We included studies of people who presented to hospital following
self-harm. Consistent with current research and clinical practice in
the UK (NICE clinical guideline 133),16 we included all types of
self-harm irrespective of motive.
For the risk scales review, we also included studies examining
the risk of suicide in people under specialist mental healthcare.
This was to broaden the scope of the review and increase the
number of studies considered. Differences in scale performance
between populations were examined where applicable.
Outcomes: risk factors and risk scales
Studies that reported an effect estimate (adjusted or unadjusted
odds ratios, risk ratios or hazard ratios (HRs) with their 95%
confidence interval) for the association between the examined risk
factor and suicide following self-harm were included for meta-
analysis. First, one of the authors (M.K.Y.C.) listed all of the risk
factors and the reported effect estimates from each study in a
table. Then, M.K.Y.C. grouped the risk factors with the reported
hazard ratios from different studies. For example, three studies
reported the adjusted hazard ratio for the risk factor ‘history of
previous self-harm’ in relation to suicide following self-harm,
and these were grouped together then meta-analysed.
Risk assessment scales required previous validation by at
least one study to be included in the review. The psychometric
properties of the scales that were examined included sensitivity,
specificity, positive predictive value (PPV) and negative predictive
value (NPV), using predefined cut-off scores. For further details
on the calculation of PPV and NPV, see Altman & Bland.17 The
main outcome was suicide. For studies that did not report PPV
or NPV, these were calculated and authors H.B. and N.M. cross-
checked each other’s calculations.
Assessment of bias in included studies
The risk factor review adopted the NICE methodology assessment
checklist for cohort studies.18 It consisted of six questions covering
the representativeness of the sample, the effect of loss to follow-up,
the measurement of prognostic factors and outcomes, the use of
confounders and the appropriateness of the statistical analysis
for the design of the study.
The quality assessment for the risk scales studies was
conducted using the NICE methodology checklist: the Quality
Assessment of Diagnostic Accuracy Studies (QUADAS) tool for
diagnostic test accuracy.18 The checklist covered the clarity of
the selection criteria, the appropriateness of the reference standard
in identifying the target condition, the clarity of the execution of
the index test and reference standard to allow replication, and an
explanation of drop-out.
There were insufficient studies in the meta-analysis to assess
publication bias through standard techniques such as Egger’s
test.19 In addition, there are currently no widely accepted
techniques for assessing the risk of publication bias in diagnostic
accuracy/screening studies;20 therefore, we did not use any of these
techniques.
Two reviewers (M.K.Y.C., H.B.) assessed the quality of each
paper. The assessment of study quality was rated by one reviewer
(H.B.) and checked by another (M.K.Y.C.). The second reviewer
(M.K.Y.C.) checked individual items on the score sheets. For any
disagreements that could not be resolved through inter-reviewer
discussion, the issues were brought before the full Guideline
Development
Group
(15
members,
including
experienced
psychiatrists, psychologists, academic researchers, practitioners
in the field of social care and service user representatives).
Discrepancies were discussed until consensus was reached in the
group.
Statistical analysis
Data were extracted and entered into a spreadsheet independently
by two reviewers (M.K.Y.C., H.B.) who then checked each other’s
data extraction and entry. Despite the limited number of studies,
meta-analysis was conducted for both reviews because suicide is
a rare outcome and meta-analyses may help to highlight the
limitations of primary data more clearly.21 ‘K’ represented the
number of populations studied, and there was no duplication
of samples in the meta-analyses. Risk factors robustly reported
across multiple distinct samples may have greater validity than
those reported in fewer samples. For the risk factor review, the
natural log of the hazard ratios and the standard errors from
the upper and lower confidence intervals reported for each risk
factor were calculated. The natural logs of the ratios and their
standard errors were entered into Review Manager 5 software
according to the grouping of risk factors. A generic inverse
variance method was used to calculate the pooled effect estimates
of the hazard ratios. The random-effects model was used to ensure
relative conservative results. The I statistic was used to quantify
heterogeneity in terms of the proportion of total variation of
the pooled effect.22
For the review of risk scales, data were required from a
minimum of four separate samples to conduct bivariate meta-
analysis – a limitation imposed by the software that was used. This
reflects difficulties in model convergence that are commonly
experienced when a smaller number of studies are included in
a complex meta-analytic model. The ‘metandi’ command for
Stata 12 was used to obtain pooled estimates of sensitivity and
specificity. Review Manager 5 was also used for producing forest
plots. Heterogeneity was assessed by visual examination of the
278

summary receiver operator characteristic (ROC) curve plots.23
Results
In total, 18 590 records were identified from the electronic
search. Of these, 18 364 citations were excluded because they were
not relevant, and 226 full-text articles were included in the
review. There were 12 prospective cohort studies included in the
meta-analysis for risk factors associated with suicide following
self-harm.8,24–34 For the full-text articles, studies were excluded
if they were retrospective in their design, if the outcomes were
not repeated self-harm or not extractable, and if the population
did not meet our criteria.35,36 More details can be found in online
Fig. DS1(a). All participants had experienced at least one episode
of self-harm and all were recruited in the hospital setting. They
were followed up for variable time periods, with suicide most
commonly determined from national registers.
Seven prospective cohort studies were included in the review
of risk scales.37–43 Studies were excluded when relevant data were
unavailable or the reference standard did not meet the criteria. For
example, studies that reported the development of a new
measure44 or did not provide usable data on the prediction of
suicide45,46 were excluded. More details can be found in online
Fig. DS1(b). Participants who had self-harmed or were under
mental healthcare had all been assessed using a risk assessment
scale. They had then been followed up, during which time the
number of deaths by suicide was determined in order to provide
data for the predictive validity of the scales used.
A risk of bias assessment was conducted for the review of risk
factors and risk scales. The two reviewers followed the guideline
methodology for assessment, and they reached consensus in their
ratings (see the Method section for details). A majority of studies
(89.5%) met the criteria and overall they were of acceptable
quality, with the exception that the majority of studies (95%) were
unclear about the reasons for loss to follow-up. For a full list of
included studies and their characteristics, see online Tables DS2
and DS3.
Risk factors
Several factors had robust evidence (the adjusted hazard ratio was
statistically significant with low heterogeneity) to support their
association with suicide following an index episode of self-harm.
They included previous episodes of self-harm, suicidal intent,
physical health problems and male gender. These factors emerged
from the meta-analysis with robust effect sizes that changed little
when adjusted for important confounders, and they appeared to
be independent of each other.
There was insufficient evidence for other factors included in
the meta-analysis to identify or discount an association with the
risk of suicide following self-harm. For instance, alcohol misuse
was of marginal significance with moderate heterogeneity; however,
definitions varied between studies, making interpretation difficult.
Psychiatric history and unemployment were also of marginal
significance after pooling the effects.
Strong evidence for an association with suicide following self-harm
Previous episodes of self-harm.
People with a history of self-
harm prior to an index episode were at higher risk of completing
suicide compared with those who did not have such a history
(adjusted HR = 1.68, 95% CI 1.38–2.05, K= 4 studies, all were
adjusted for confounders and non-significant heterogeneity was
observed, I2 = 19%, Table 1).
Suicidal intent.
People with suicidal intent were more likely to
complete suicide following their index episode of self-harm
(adjusted HR = 2.70, 95% CI 1.91–3.81, K= 3, Table 1). The three
studies had slightly different definitions of ‘suicidal intent’
,
although no heterogeneity was observed in our analysis. Aside

Gender.
Compared with females, males were at higher risk of
completing suicide following an episode of self-harm. Data
were pooled to report an adjusted hazard ratio of 2.05 (95% CI
1.70–2.46, K = 5, Table 1). No heterogeneity was observed.
Poor physical health.
People with poor physical health/chronic
illness were at higher risk of suicide following self-harm. The
adjusted hazard ratio for the association between poor physical
health and completed suicide was statistically significant (adjusted
HR = 1.99, 95% CI 1.16–3.43, K= 3, I2 = 29%, Table 1).
Marginal evidence for an association with suicide following
self-harm
History of psychiatric contact.
People with a history of contact
with psychiatric services were found to be at a slightly higher risk
of suicide following self-harm than those without such a history.
An adjusted hazard ratio of 1.27, 95% CI 0.94–1.73 (K = 4,
I2 = 55%) was found (see Table 1 for the unadjusted hazard ratio).
The heterogeneity might be explained by the inconsistency in the
definition of psychiatric contact.
Alcohol misuse.
The association between alcohol misuse and
completed suicide following self-harm was found to be marginally
significant. The adjusted hazard ratio was reported as 1.63, 95%
CI 1.00–2.65, K= 3. However, high heterogeneity was observed
(I2 = 53% (heterogeneity over 50% was regarded as high)).
Unadjusted data from two studies were also pooled, yet resulted
in considerable heterogeneity (I2 = 64%) (Table 1). Participants
in the studies had a psychiatric diagnosis of alcohol misuse, but
it was unclear whether alcohol was consumed shortly before they
died by suicide.
Economic status.
The pooled and adjusted hazard ratio for this
association was not statistically significant (adjusted HR = 1.08,
95% CI 0.65–1.8, K = 3) and high heterogeneity was observed
(I2 = 71%). The wide confidence interval suggested no clear
evidence of an association in the context of high heterogeneity.
For the list of adjusted confounding factors, please refer to online
Table DS4.
Risk scales
Three scales were included in this review: the Beck Hopelessness
Scale (BHS),37 the Suicide Intent Scale (SIS)39 and the Scale for
Suicide Ideation (SSI).38 A brief description of what these tools
were designed to measure/assess are listed in online Table DS5.
Table 2 shows the results of the predictive validity of the scales
reviewed.
Scales that predict suicide in clinical populations
Of the three included scales, meta-analysis was conducted for
studies that used the BHS and SIS, whereas the SSI did not have
enough data points. The analysis of the BHS for predicting suicide
in high-risk groups comprised four studies: two with patients
receiving mental healthcare (60 and 180 months’ follow-up)37,38
and two with people who had self-harmed (4 and 144 months’
follow-up)40,43 with a total sample size of 4302. When meta-
analysed, the results showed moderate sensitivity (0.80; 95% CI
0.64–0.90) and low specificity (0.46, 95% CI 0.41–0.51). There
was moderate to high heterogeneity for both sensitivity and
specificity (see Fig. 1(a) for the summary ROC plot and Fig.
2(a) for forest plots). Although comparisons are limited by the
small number of studies in the meta-analysis, the BHS appeared

to be more sensitive for patients receiving mental healthcare than
for people who had self-harmed, but in both groups it was similar
in terms of specificity.
The highest sensitivity (100%) reported in any study was for
the SIS (54 to 120 months’ follow-up).42 However, the sensitivity
of the SIS was much lower in other studies that investigated this
instrument. The meta-analysis of the SIS as a whole found
relatively low sensitivity (0.73, 95% CI 0.58–0.84) and specificity
(0.64, 95% CI 0.50–0.76) based on four populations from three
studies and 3124 participants (see Figs. 1(b) and 2(b)).
Discussion
Main findings
This is the first meta-analysis of prospective studies investigating
risk factors associated with suicide following an episode of self-
harm. There is robust pooled evidence from 12 studies to show
that four factors (previous episodes of self-harm, suicidal intent,
poor physical health and male gender) are associated with a higher
risk of dying by suicide following the index episode. In these
studies, at least 32% of people had a prior history of self-harm
before the index episode.
This is also the first systematic review and meta-analysis of a
range of risk scales investigating their potential to improve the
prediction of suicide in high-risk groups. However, despite using
broad inclusion criteria, only seven studies providing data on
three scales (BHS, SSI, SIS) met the criteria for our review. Of
these three scales, it was only possible to conduct meta-analysis
on two (BHS, SIS). From this review, there is no robust evidence
to support the use of one risk scale over another, and because all
the scales reviewed had a low PPV with significant numbers of
false positives these scales should not be used in clinical practice
alone to assess the future risk of suicide. Taken together, our
findings cast doubt on the current approach to ‘risk assessment’
in which risk tools and scales have become the norm.
Methodological issues
Although this review employed a systematic approach, the overlap
of risk factors and the fact that very few studies adjust for the
same confounders limits our confidence in the meta-analysis. In
addition, comprehensive data on the factors associated with
suicide following self-harm are not always available. Clearly, these
problems limit the interpretation of our findings and leave some
uncertainty about which factors should be regarded as the most
important markers of risk. Moreover, studies measure risk factors
in different ways, which may contribute to the heterogeneity and/
or uncertainty of some of the results.
With regard to the risk scales review, a paucity of studies meant
that there were limited options for conducting a meta-analysis.
In addition, where meta-analyses were possible they were based
on sparse data and high heterogeneity. Therefore, only limited
conclusions can be drawn. An important drawback is that there
were low PPVs (between 1.3 and 16.7%) found for all scales. It
could be argued that the low PPV is simply a reflection of the

low incidence of fatal outcomes. This suggests that such scales are
identifying many false positives, thereby limiting their utility.
However, these studies had very long follow-up periods (up to
15 years), which would increase the incidence of such outcomes.
In the shorter term, it is thought that the PPV of these scales will
be even lower. For example, Nimeus and colleagues40 used the
shortest follow-up period (4 months) compared with the
other studies and found a PPV of 8%. Nevertheless, the clinical
implications drawn from studies using long follow-up periods
may be of limited use because clinicians’ primary concern is
to predict suicide in the immediate period following an act of
self-harm, rather than in the subsequent months or years. It is also
important to recognise that different studies used different risk
scales, and some used different cut-off scores for the same risk
scales (BHS and SIS). This is probably because reported cut-off
scores were determined post hoc based on optimal performance
derived from the ROC curve. Such approaches are likely to
overestimate the screening accuracy of the test, which further
raises concerns regarding the performance of all risk scales. Taking
these limitations into account, we can conclude that there is
insufficient evidence to support the use of risk scales and tools
in clinical practice. Nevertheless, given the complexity in this
area, the utility of novel risk factors, groups of risk factors and
interactions between risk factors in assessment might be helpfully
explored in future studies.
Clinical implications
Self-harm is a major health problem in many countries. People
who self-harm have poorer physical health and a lower life
expectancy than the general population.24 What do the results
of our review tell us about how we should manage self-harm?
Clearly, some factors indicate an increased risk of suicide in this
population. We found the strongest evidence for long-recognised
risk factors – previous episodes of self-harm, suicidal intent, poor
physical health and male gender. The major advantage of our
study over previous work was the ability to specifically investigate
predictors of suicide risk following self-harm, and to pool findings
across studies to produce robust estimates of the magnitude of any
increased risk. However, when assessing people following an act of
self-harm, being able to identify these associated factors is still
unlikely to help us to predict the risk of later suicide,48 because
these characteristics are common in clinical populations.
All of the scales and tools reviewed here had poor predictive
value. The use of these scales or an over-reliance on the identification
of risk factors in clinical practice, is, in our view, potentially dangerous
and may provide false reassurance for clinicians and managers.
The idea of risk assessment as risk prediction is a fallacy and
should be recognised as such. We are simply unable to say with
any certainty who will and will not go on to have poor outcomes.
People who self-harm often have complex and difficult life
circumstances, and clearly need to be assessed – but we need to
move away from assessment models that prioritise risks at the
expense of needs.
An alternative approach to the assessment of people who have
self-harmed might be to characterise the prior act of self-harm,
determine the specific factors that precipitated that episode for
that individual and identify those personal factors that could
increase the likelihood of later suicide. This may include recognition
of the more robust factors identified by this review, including male
gender, suicidal intent, having poor physical health and having
self-harmed before. It would also include other factors not
necessarily common to other people who have self-harmed. To
do this would involve: first, understanding the meaning of the
act of self-harm for that individual, taking into account their
current relationships, context and past experiences; and, second,
understanding how the act of self-harm, the person’s intent and
their affective state interrelate. No doubt, many of the factors
identified in the previous or current reviews will be relevant at
assessment. But many will not be. Importantly, there is some
evidence that thorough assessments after self-harm may on their
own improve outcomes.49,50 The opportunity for service users
to discuss their concerns and formulate action plans may drive
the improvements, or it may be that thorough assessments
facilitate access to aftercare.
In our collective quest to reduce the risk of suicide following
self-harm by building highly structured assessment tools from risk
factors, rather than encouraging a real engagement with the
individual, we may well be putting our own professional anxieties
above the needs of service users and, paradoxically, increasing the
risks of suicide following self-harm.
