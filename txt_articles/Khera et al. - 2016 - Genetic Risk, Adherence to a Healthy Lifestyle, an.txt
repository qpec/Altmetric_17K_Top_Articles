Abstract
BACKGROUND—Both genetic and lifestyle factors contribute to individual-level risk of 
coronary artery disease. The extent to which increased genetic risk can be offset by a healthy 
lifestyle is unknown.
METHODS—Using a polygenic score of DNA sequence polymorphisms, we quantified genetic 
risk for coronary artery disease in three prospective cohorts — 7814 participants in the 
Atherosclerosis Risk in Communities (ARIC) study, 21,222 in the Women’s Genome Health Study 
(WGHS), and 22,389 in the Malmö Diet and Cancer Study (MDCS) — and in 4260 participants in 
the cross-sectional BioImage Study for whom genotype and covariate data were available. We also 
determined adherence to a healthy lifestyle among the participants using a scoring system 
consisting of four factors: no current smoking, no obesity, regular physical activity, and a healthy 
diet.
RESULTS—The relative risk of incident coronary events was 91% higher among participants at 
high genetic risk (top quintile of polygenic scores) than among those at low genetic risk (bottom 
quintile of polygenic scores) (hazard ratio, 1.91; 95% confidence interval [CI], 1.75 to 2.09). A 
favorable lifestyle (defined as at least three of the four healthy lifestyle factors) was associated

 with a substantially lower risk of coronary events than an unfavorable lifestyle (defined as no or 
only one healthy lifestyle factor), regardless of the genetic risk category. Among participants at 
high genetic risk, a favorable lifestyle was associated with a 46% lower relative risk of coronary 
events than an unfavorable lifestyle (hazard ratio, 0.54; 95% CI, 0.47 to 0.63). This finding 
corresponded to a reduction in the standardized 10-year incidence of coronary events from 10.7% 
for an unfavorable lifestyle to 5.1% for a favorable lifestyle in ARIC, from 4.6% to 2.0% in 
WGHS, and from 8.2% to 5.3% in MDCS. In the BioImage Study, a favorable lifestyle was 
associated with significantly less coronary-artery calcification within each genetic risk category.
CONCLUSIONS—Across four studies involving 55,685 participants, genetic and lifestyle factors 
were independently associated with susceptibility to coronary artery disease. Among participants 
at high genetic risk, a favorable lifestyle was associated with a nearly 50% lower relative risk of 
coronary artery disease than was an unfavorable lifestyle. (Funded by the National Institutes of 
Health and others.)
Both genetic and lifestyle factors are key drivers of coronary artery disease, a complex 
disorder that is the leading cause of death worldwide.1 A familial pattern in the risk of 
coronary artery disease was first described in 1938 and was subsequently confirmed in large 
studies involving twins and prospective cohorts.2–6 Since 2007, genomewide association 
analyses have identified more than 50 independent loci associated with the risk of coronary 
artery disease.7–15 These risk alleles, when aggregated into a polygenic risk score, are 
predictive of incident coronary events and provide a continuous and quantitative measure of 
genetic susceptibility.16–24
Much evidence has also shown that persons who adhere to a healthy lifestyle have markedly 
reduced rates of incident cardiovascular events.25–30 The promotion of healthy lifestyle 
behaviors, which include not smoking, avoiding obesity, regular physical activity, and a 
healthy diet pattern, underlies the current strategy to improve cardiovascular health in the 
general population.31
Many observers assume that a genetic predisposition to coronary artery disease is 
deterministic.32 However, genetic risk might be attenuated by a favorable lifestyle. Here, we 
analyzed data for participants in three prospective cohorts and one cross-sectional study to 
test the hypothesis that both genetic factors and baseline adherence to a healthy lifestyle 
contribute independently to the risk of incident coronary events and the prevalent subclinical 
burden of atherosclerosis. We then determined the extent to which a healthy lifestyle is 
associated with a reduced risk of coronary artery disease among participants with a high 
genetic risk.
Methods
Study Populations
The Atherosclerosis Risk in Communities (ARIC) study is a prospective cohort that enrolled 
white participants and black participants between the ages of 45 and 64 years, starting in 
1987.33 For data from this study, we retrieved genotype and clinical data from the National 
Center for Biotechnology Information dbGAP server (accession number, phs000280.v3.p1). 
The Women’s Genome Health Study (WGHS) is a prospective cohort of female health

 professionals derived from the Women’s Health Study, a clinical trial initiated in 1992 to 
evaluate the efficacy of aspirin and vitamin E in the primary prevention of cardiovascular 
disease.34 The Malmö Diet and Cancer Study (MDCS) is a prospective cohort that enrolled 
participants between the ages of 44 and 73 years in Malmö, Sweden, starting in 1991.35 In 
this study, participants with prevalent coronary disease at baseline were excluded. The 
BioImage Study enrolled asymptomatic participants between the ages of 55 and 80 years 
who were at risk for cardiovascular disease, beginning in 2008. This study included 
quantification of subclinical coronary artery disease in Agatston units, a metric that 
combines the area and density of observed coronary-artery calcification.36
Polygenic Risk Score
We derived a polygenic risk score from an analysis of up to 50 single-nucleotide 
polymorphisms (SNPs) that had achieved genomewide significance for association with 
coronary artery disease in previous studies. Details regarding the cohort-specific genotyping 
platform and risk scores are provided in Table S1 in the Supplementary Appendix, available 
with the full text of this article at NEJM.org.11–14 An example of the calculation of the 
polygenic risk score is provided in Table S2 in the Supplementary Appendix. Individual 
participant scores were created by adding up the number of risk alleles at each SNP and then 
multiplying the sum by the literature-based effect size.17 The genetic substructure of the 
population was assessed by calculating the principal components of ancestry.37
Healthy Lifestyle Factors
We adapted four healthy lifestyle factors from the strategic goals of the American Heart 
Association (AHA) — no current smoking, no obesity (body-mass index [the weight in 
kilograms divided by the square of the height in meters], <30), physical activity at least once 
weekly, and a healthy diet pattern.31 A healthy diet pattern was ascertained on the basis of 
adherence to at least half of the following recently endorsed characteristics38: consumption 
of an increased amount of fruits, nuts, vegetables, whole grains, fish, and dairy products and 
a reduced amount of refined grains, processed meats, unprocessed red meats, sugar-
sweetened beverages, trans fats (WGHS only), and sodium (WGHS only). Because a 
detailed food-frequency questionnaire was not performed in the BioImage Study, diet scores 
in that cohort focused on self-reported consumption of fruits, vegetables, and fish. 
Additional details regarding cohort-specific metrics for lifestyle factors are provided in 
Table S3 in the Supplementary Appendix.
Study End Points
The primary study end point for the prospective cohort populations was a composite of 
coronary artery disease events that included myocardial infarction, coronary 
revascularization, and death from coronary causes. End-point adjudication was performed by 
a committee review of medical records within each cohort. In the BioImage Study, a cross-
sectional analysis of baseline scores for coronary-artery calcification was performed.

 Statistical Analysis
We used Cox proportional-hazard models to test the association of genetic and lifestyle 
factors with incident coronary events. We compared hazard ratios for participants at high 
genetic risk (i.e., highest quintile of polygenic scores) with those at intermediate risk 
(quintiles 2 to 4) or low risk (lowest quintile), as described previously.22,23 Similarly, we 
compared a favorable lifestyle (which was defined as the presence of at least three of the 
four healthy lifestyle factors) with an intermediate lifestyle (two healthy lifestyle factors) or 
an unfavorable lifestyle (no or only one healthy lifestyle factor). The primary analyses 
included adjustment for age, sex, self-reported education level, and the first five principal 
components of ancestry (unavailable in MDCS). In addition, WGHS analyses were adjusted 
for initial trial randomization to aspirin versus placebo and vitamin E versus placebo. We 
used Cox regression to calculate 10-year event rates, which were standardized to the mean of 
all predictor variables within each population. Because of a skewed distribution of scores for 
coronary-artery calcification in the BioImage Study, linear regression was performed on 
natural log-transformed calcification scores with an offset of 1. Predicted values were then 
reverse-transformed to calculate standardized scores, with higher values indicating an 
increased burden of coronary atherosclerosis. All the analyses were performed with the use 
of R software, version 3.1 (R Project for Statistical Computing).
Results
The populations in the prospective cohort studies included 7814 of 11,478 white participants 
in the ARIC cohort, 21,222 of 23,294 white women in the WGHS cohort, and 22,389 of 
30,446 participants in the MDCS cohort for whom genotype and covariate data were 
available (Table 1). During follow-up, 1230 coronary events were observed in the ARIC 
cohort (median follow-up, 18.8 years), 971 coronary events in the WGHS cohort (median 
follow-up, 20.5 years), and 2902 coronary events in the MDCS cohort (median follow-up, 
19.4 years) (Table S4 in the Supplementary Appendix). Categories of genetic and lifestyle 
risk were mutually independent within each cohort (Fig. S1 in the Supplementary 
Appendix).
Polygenic risk scores approximated a normal distribution within each cohort (Fig. S2 in the 
Supplementary Appendix). A risk gradient was noted across quintiles of genetic risk such 
that the participants at high genetic risk (i.e., in the top quintile of the polygenic scores) were 
at significantly higher risk of coronary events than those at low genetic risk (i.e., in the 
lowest quintile), with adjusted hazard ratios of 1.75 (95% confidence interval [CI], 1.46 to 
2.10) in the ARIC cohort, 1.94 (95% CI, 1.58 to 2.39) in the WGHS cohort, and 1.98 (95% 
CI, 1.76 to 2.23) in the MDCS cohort (Fig. 1, and Table S5 and Fig. S3 in the 
Supplementary Appendix). Across all three cohorts, the relative risk of incident coronary 
events was 91% higher among participants at high genetic risk than among those at low 
genetic risk (hazard ratio, 1.91; 95% CI, 1.75 to 2.09). A family history of coronary artery 
disease was an imperfect surrogate for genotype-defined risk, although the prevalence of 
such a self-reported family history tended to be higher among participants at high genetic 
risk than among those at low genetic risk. Levels of low-density lipoprotein (LDL) 
cholesterol were modestly increased across categories of genetic risk within each cohort. By

 contrast, genetic risk categories were independent of other cardiometabolic risk factors and 
10-year cardiovascular risk as predicted by the pooled cohorts equation of the American 
College of Cardiology–AHA (Tables S6 through S9 in the Supplementary Appendix).
Each of the four healthy lifestyle factors was associated with a decreased risk of coronary 
events in a combined analysis of the prospective cohorts: no current smoking (hazard ratio, 
0.56; 95% CI, 0.47 to 0.66), no obesity (hazard ratio, 0.66; 95% CI, 0.58 to 0.76), regular 
physical activity (hazard ratio, 0.88; 95% CI, 0.80 to 0.97), and healthy diet (hazard ratio, 
0.91; 95% CI, 0.83 to 0.99) (Table S10 in the Supplementary Appendix). Coronary risk 
increased among participants with fewer healthy lifestyle factors within each cohort (Table 
S11 in the Supplementary Appendix).
Each cohort was divided into three lifestyle risk categories: favorable (at least three of the 
four healthy lifestyle factors), intermediate (two healthy lifestyle factors), or unfavorable (no 
or only one healthy lifestyle factor). Participants with an unfavorable lifestyle had higher 
rates of baseline hypertension and diabetes, a higher body-mass index, and less favorable 
levels of circulating lipids than did those with a favorable lifestyle (Tables S12, S13, and S14 
in the Supplementary Appendix). An unfavorable lifestyle was associated with a higher risk 
of coronary events than a favorable lifestyle, with an adjusted hazard ratio of 1.71 (95% CI, 
1.47 to 1.98) in the ARIC cohort, 2.27 (95% CI, 1.92 to 2.67) in the WGHS cohort, and 1.77 
(95% CI, 1.61 to 1.95) in the MDCS cohort (Fig. 1, and Fig. S3 in the Supplementary 
Appendix).
Within each category of genetic risk, lifestyle factors were strong predictors of coronary 
events (Fig. 2). Adherence to a favorable lifestyle, as compared with an unfavorable 
lifestyle, was associated with a 45% lower relative risk among participants at low genetic 
risk, a 47% lower relative risk among those at intermediate genetic risk, and a 46% lower 
relative risk (hazard ratio, 0.54; 95% CI, 0.47 to 0.63) among those at high genetic risk. 
Among participants at high genetic risk, the standardized 10-year coronary event rates were 
10.7% among those with an unfavorable lifestyle and 5.1% among those with a favorable 
lifestyle in the ARIC cohort, 4.6% and 2.0%, respectively, in the WGHS cohort, and 8.2% 
and 5.3% in the MDCS cohort (Fig. 3). Similarly, a low genetic risk was largely offset by an 
unfavorable lifestyle. Among participants at low genetic risk, standardized 10-year coronary 
event rates were 5.8% among those with an unfavorable lifestyle and 3.1% among those with 
a favorable lifestyle in the ARIC cohort, 1.8% and 1.2%, respectively, in the WGHS cohort, 
and 4.7% and 2.6% in the MDCS cohort. Similar patterns were noted after the exclusion of 
coronary revascularization from the composite end point (Fig. S4 in the Supplementary 
Appendix). Adjustment for traditional risk factors attenuated estimates, although the 
decreased risk among participants with a favorable lifestyle within each genetic risk 
category remained apparent (Table S15 and Fig. S5 in the Supplementary Appendix).
Despite a paucity of well-validated genetic loci in black populations, we observed similar 
findings among black participants and white participants in the ARIC cohort (Fig. S6 in the 
Supplementary Appendix). However, additional data are needed to confirm the consistency 
of the effect in populations of African ancestry.

 A cross-sectional analysis of 4260 of 4301 white participants with available data from the 
BioImage Study showed that both genetic and lifestyle factors were associated with 
coronaryartery calcification (stratified according to the baseline characteristics in Tables S16 
and S17 in the Supplementary Appendix). The standardized calcification score was 46 
Agatston units (95% CI, 39 to 54) among participants at high genetic risk, as compared with 
21 Agatston units (95% CI, 18 to 25) among those at low genetic risk (P<0.001). The 
calcification score was similarly higher among participants with an unfavorable lifestyle 
than among those with a favorable lifestyle: 46 Agatston units (95% CI, 40 to 53) versus 28 
Agatston units (95% CI, 25 to 31) (P<0.001). Within each subgroup of genetic risk, a 
significant trend was observed toward decreased coronaryartery calcification among 
participants who were more adherent to a healthy lifestyle (Fig. 4).
Discussion
In this study, we have provided quantitative data about the interplay between genetic and 
lifestyle risk factors for coronary artery disease in three prospective cohorts and one cross-
sectional study. High genetic risk was independent of healthy lifestyle behaviors and was 
associated with an increased risk (hazard ratio, 1.91) of coronary events and a substantially 
increased burden of coronary-artery calcification. However, within any genetic risk category, 
adherence to a healthy lifestyle was associated with a significantly decreased risk of both 
clinical coronary events and subclinical burden of coronary artery disease.
The results of this analysis support three noteworthy conclusions. First, our data indicate that 
inherited DNA variation and lifestyle factors contribute independently to a susceptibility to 
coronary artery disease. Our finding that a polygenic risk score has robust associations with 
incident coronary events is well aligned with previous studies of both primary and secondary 
prevention populations.16–24 Such findings support long-standing beliefs that genetic 
variants that are identifiable from birth alter coronary risk.2–4 Aside from slight differences 
in LDL cholesterol levels and a family history of coronary artery disease, genetic risk was 
independent of traditionally measured risk factors.
Second, a healthy lifestyle was associated with similar relative risk reductions in event rates 
across each stratum of genetic risk. Although the absolute risk reduction that was associated 
with adherence to a healthy lifestyle was greatest in the group at high genetic risk, our 
results support public health efforts that emphasize a healthy lifestyle for everyone. An 
alternative approach is to target intensive lifestyle modification to those at high genetic risk, 
with the expectation that disclosure of genetic risk can motivate behavioral change. 
However, whether the provision of such information can improve cardiovascular outcomes 
remains to be determined.
Third, patients may equate DNA-based risk estimates with determinism, a perceived lack of 
control over the ability to improve outcomes.32 However, our results provide evidence that 
lifestyle factors may powerfully modify risk regardless of the patient’s genetic risk profile. 
Indeed, alternative analytic approaches that incorporate more stringent cutoffs or weight the 
relative effect for each healthy lifestyle factor may lead to an even more pronounced 
coronary risk gradient.

 Our study has several limitations. First, because adherence to a healthy lifestyle was not 
randomized, the association of lifestyle factors with the risk of coronary events cannot be 
taken as a causal relationship. Second, investigators in each cohort used slightly different 
methods to assess lifestyle at baseline. Behavioral changes before or after ascertainment or 
competing risks of other illnesses may have had an effect on risk estimates. Third, although 
we included up to 50 previously validated genetic polymorphisms in the polygenic risk 
score, the inclusion of even more variants may prove useful in future analyses.24 Finally, 
even though we provide evidence confirming a relationship between a polygenic risk score 
and coronary events among black participants, the generalizability of our findings should be 
tested in more diverse populations as more robust ethnicity-specific data regarding genetic 
association become available.
In conclusion, after quantifying both genetic and lifestyle risk among 55,685 participants in 
three prospective cohorts and one cross-sectional study, we found that adherence to a healthy 
lifestyle was associated with a substantially reduced risk of coronary artery disease within 
each category of genetic risk.

 Figure 1. Standardized Coronary Events Rates, According to Genetic and Lifestyle Risk in the 
Prospective Cohorts
Shown are the standardized rates of coronary events, according to the genetic risk and 
lifestyle risk of participants in the Atherosclerosis Risk in Communities (ARIC) cohort, the 
Women’s Genome Health Study (WGHS) cohort, and the Malmö Diet and Cancer Study 
(MDCS) cohort. The 95% confidence intervals for the hazard ratios are provided in 
parentheses. Cox regression models were adjusted for age, sex (in ARIC and MDCS), 
randomization to receive vitamin E or aspirin (in WGHS), education level, and principal

 Figure 2. Risk of Coronary Events, According to Genetic and Lifestyle Risk in the Prospective 
Cohorts
Shown are adjusted hazard ratios for coronary events in each of the three prospective 
cohorts, according to genetic risk and lifestyle risk. In these comparisons, participants at low 
genetic risk with a favorable lifestyle served as the reference group. There was no evidence 
of a significant interaction between genetic and lifestyle risk factors (P = 0.38 for interaction 
in the Atherosclerosis Risk in Communities (ARIC) cohort, P = 0.31 in the Women’s 
Genome Health Study (WGHS) cohort, and P = 0.24 in the Malmö Diet and Cancer Study

 Figure 4. Coronary-Artery Calcification Score in the BioImage Study, According to Lifestyle and 
Genetic Risk
Among the participants in the BioImage Study, a standardized score for coronary-artery 
calcification was determined by means of linear regression after adjustment for age, sex, 
education level, and principal components of ancestry. Standardization was performed on the 
basis of study averages for each covariate. Average standardized coronary-artery 
calcification scores are expressed in Agatston units, with higher scores indicating an 
increased burden of coronary atherosclerosis. The I bars represent 95% confidence intervals.

*Plus–minus values are means ±SD. P values for the differences between the study groups in each individual cohort at baseline are provided in the 
tables in the Supplementary Appendix. To convert the values for cholesterol to millimoles per liter, multiply by 0.02586. To convert the values for 
triglycerides to millimoles per liter, multiply by 0.01129. HDL denotes high-density lipoprotein, IQR interquartile range, and LDL low-density 
lipoprotein.
†A family history of premature coronary artery disease refers to a self-reported parental history of myocardial infarction before the age of 60 years. 
In the BioImage Study and the Malmö Diet and Cancer Study (MDCS), participants were asked about a parental history of myocardial infarction 
without an age restriction.
‡The body-mass index is the weight in kilograms divided by the square of the height in meters.
