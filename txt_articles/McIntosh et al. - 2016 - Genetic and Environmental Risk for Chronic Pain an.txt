Abstract
Background
Chronic pain is highly prevalent and a significant source of disability, yet its genetic and
environmental risk factors are poorly understood. Its relationship with major depressive dis-
order (MDD) is of particular importance. We sought to test the contribution of genetic factors
and shared and unique environment to risk of chronic pain and its correlation with MDD in
Generation Scotland: Scottish Family Health Study (GS:SFHS). We then sought to replicate
any significant findings in the United Kingdom Biobank study.
Methods and Findings
Using family-based mixed-model analyses, we examined the contribution of genetics and
shared family environment to chronic pain by spouse, sibling, and household relationships.
These analyses were conducted in GS:SFHS (n = 23,960), a family- and population-based
study of individuals recruited from the Scottish population through their general practition-
ers. We then examined and partitioned the correlation between chronic pain and MDD and
estimated the contribution of genetic factors and shared environment in GS:SFHS. Finally,
we used data from two independent genome-wide association studies to test whether
chronic pain has a polygenic architecture and examine whether genomic risk of psychiatric
disorder predicted chronic pain and whether genomic risk of chronic pain predicted MDD.

 These analyses were conducted in GS:SFHS and repeated in UK Biobank, a study of
500,000 from the UK population, of whom 112,151 had genotyping and phenotypic data.
Chronic pain is a moderately heritable trait (heritability = 38.4%, 95% CI 33.6% to 43.9%)
that is significantly concordant in spouses (variance explained 18.7%, 95% CI 9.5% to
25.1%). Chronic pain is positively correlated with depression (ρ = 0.13, 95% CI 0.11 to 0.15,
p = 2.72x10-68) and shows a tendency to cluster within families for genetic reasons (genetic
correlation = 0.51, 95%CI 0.40 to 0.62, p = 8.24x10-19). Polygenic risk profiles for pain, gen-
erated using independent GWAS data, were associated with chronic pain in both GS:SFHS
(maximum β = 6.18x10-2, 95% CI 2.84 x10-2 to 9.35 x10-2, p = 4.3x10-4) and UK Biobank
(maximum β = 5.68 x 10−2, 95% CI 4.70x10-2 to 6.65x10-2
, p < 3x10-4). Genomic risk of
MDD is also significantly associated with chronic pain in both GS:SFHS (maximum β =
6.62x10-2, 95% CI 2.82 x10-2 to 9.76 x10-2
, p = 4.3x10-4) and UK Biobank (maximum β =
2.56x10-2, 95% CI 1.62x10-2 to 3.63x10-2
, p < 3x10-4). Limitations of the current study
include the possibility that spouse effects may be due to assortative mating and the rela-
tively small polygenic risk score effect sizes.
Conclusions
Genetic factors, as well as chronic pain in a partner or spouse, contribute substantially to
the risk of chronic pain for an individual. Chronic pain is genetically correlated with MDD,
has a polygenic architecture, and is associated with polygenic risk of MDD.
Author Summary
Why Was This Study Done?
• Genetic factors and the environment you share with your nuclear family, siblings, or
spouse may determine your risk of chronic pain.
• Depression is also associated with chronic pain, but whether this relationship is
explained by shared genetic factors, environment, or both is not known.
• We sought to investigate these issues using genetic data and family environmental
information from Generation Scotland: Scottish Family Health Study and UK
Biobank.
What Did the Researchers Do and Find?
• Using data from the family-based Generation Scotland study, we found that genetic
factors and the environment you share with your partner/spouse are important risk
factors for the development of chronic pain.
• Shared genetic and environmental factors also partly explained the association
between chronic pain and depression.
• Finally, we found evidence showing that the genetic contribution to chronic pain
arises through the combined effect of many different genetic risk factors and that the

 cumulative effects of genetic risk factors for depression increased an individual’s
chance of having chronic pain.
What Do These Findings Mean?
• Both genetic factors and chronic pain in a partner or spouse contribute to the risk of
chronic pain for an individual.
• Chronic pain is caused by an accumulation of many small genetic effects and is asso-
ciated with some of the same genetic and environmental risk factors that confer risk
of depression.
Introduction
Chronic pain and major depressive disorder (MDD) are highly prevalent and frequently
comorbid conditions [1] that complicate chronic physical disease and are leading causes of dis-
ability globally [2]. The causes of chronic pain and depression are poorly understood, although
there is evidence of a contribution from genetic factors in each disorder [3,4]. One means of
identifying the magnitude of genetic contributions to a disorder is to use a family-based study
design. Family-based studies can be used to determine the heritability of a trait by examining
the trait correlations between pairs of relatives of varying proximity.
Chronic pain can be considered as a unified, heritable phenotype. Using a family-based
approach involving 7,644 individuals from 2,195 extended families from Generation Scotland:
Scottish Family Health Study (GS:SFHS), Hocking et al. demonstrated that severe chronic pain
has a heritability of 30% [5]. In twin studies, the broad sense heritability of chronic pain has
also been estimated similarly at 32% [6]. Williams et al. [7] examined pain reporting at seven
sites among the twins and found a single “pain reporting” factor with a heritability of 0.46,
which accounted for 95% of the variance of correlation between reporting at different sites.
Separately, Vehof et al. [8] identified a latent trait with a heritability of 0.66 that explained the
co-occurrence of a number of different chronic pain syndromes in twins, suggesting a common
aetiological pathway with a strong genetic basis. The genetic architecture of chronic pain is,
however, unknown, and while human and animal studies suggest potentially a polygenic con-
tribution of many common variants to differences in liability [9], to our knowledge, this suppo-
sition remains unproven. The heritability of MDD has been estimated, from a meta-analysis of
twin studies, at around 37% [10,11], similar to estimates for chronic pain. Whilst the majority
of the heritability of MDD is not explained by the risk variants discovered to date, the genetic
architecture of MDD is understood to be highly polygenic, with multiple loci of low-penetrance
acting additively to confer liability to the disorder [12,13].
The risk factors and associations of chronic pain and depression are also numerous and
overlapping [14–21]. Since chronic pain and depression are amongst the most disabling condi-
tions worldwide, it is important to understand the nature of their co-occurrence and whether
this is caused by shared genetic or environmental factors. Studies that quantify the relative
roles of genetics and shared and unique environment in chronic pain, including those that seek
to explain its correlation with depression, are few. One study of 3,266 female twins estimated
the cross-trait correlation between depression and pain and found a latent trait that explained
the covariance between chronic widespread pain and major depression, with 86% heritability

 [22]. Another study, among women in the Swedish Twins Registry, examining four “functional
somatic syndromes” (including chronic widespread pain (CWP) and MDD), identified two
latent traits with quantified additive genetic and non-shared environmental contributions [23].
One of these was mainly genetic and contributed significantly to the variance of both condi-
tions (0.29 for CWP; 0.76 for MDD); the other was mainly environmental and did not contrib-
ute to MDD, but did to CWP (0.81). Such studies may help to clarify how these two common
conditions are related and could be used to help manage disease risk at the population level.
The main aim of the current study was to assess the genetic and environmental contribu-
tions to pain and its comorbidity with MDD. Using data from GS:SFHS [24], we estimated the
magnitude of the contribution to chronic pain from genetic factors, and from shared and
unique environmental influences using pedigree-based analyses. By examining the effects of
shared environment whilst simultaneously modelling genetic factors, we were able to indepen-
dently assess and separate both sources of phenotypic variance in a single model. Next, we
measured the correlation between chronic pain and MDD using bivariate pedigree-based anal-
ysis. By modelling genetics and shared environment, we sought to identify and measure the
independent contributions of these factors to the observed covariance between chronic pain
and MDD. In order to test for a shared genetic architecture for chronic pain and MDD using
independent and convergent data, we then conducted a polygenic profile scoring analysis. We
used data from two large-scale and independent genome-wide association studies (GWAS) of
chronic pain and MDD to prepare a polygenic risk profile for individuals in GS:SFHS and UK
Biobank. We then examined whether polygenic risk of MDD was associated with chronic pain
using molecular genetic data, and if polygenic risk of chronic pain predicted MDD.
Methods
Two cohorts were used to examine the genetic and environmental contributions to chronic
pain and its relationship with depression: GS:SFHS (n = 23,960) and UK Biobank (UKB,
n = 112,151). GS:SFHS, having a family-based design, was used to estimate the contributions of
genetic factors and of shared and unique environment to chronic pain and its correlation with
MDD. GS:SFHS includes a number of different genetic relationships, from first degree to more
distant relationships beyond second cousin. By examining the correlation in chronic pain
between relatives of different proximities, it is possible to estimate trait heritability. However,
these estimates can be confounded by the effects of shared environment, and for this reason,
we included the effects of these shared environments to adjust these heritability estimates and
also assess their independent contribution to phenotypic variance.
GS:SFHS and UKB were then both used to test the genetic relationship between chronic
pain and depression risk scores and their associated phenotypes using polygenic risk score
analysis. Marker effects were estimated from independent GWAS studies that did not include
either the GS:SFHS or UKB study samples. This included the output from a collaborative
GWAS analysis between Pfizer and 23andMe.
All GS:SFHS individuals provided written informed consent to participation and for use of
their data and samples for medical research. Ethical approval for the study was given by the
National Health Service Tayside committee on research ethics (reference 05/s1401/89). UK
Biobank (http://www.ukbiobank.ac.uk) received ethical approval from the Research Ethics
Committee (reference 11/NW/0382) and the present analyses were conducted under UK Bio-
bank data application numbers 4844 and 3501. All UK Biobank participants provided written
informed consent. Summary data from a previous genetic study of chronic pain (conducted in
collaboration with Pfizer-23andMe) were also used in the current study. The original genetic
study was approved by the Institutional Research Board, and 23andMe received ethical

 approval from the Ethical and Independent Review Services. All 23andMe participants pro-
vided written informed consent.
Generation Scotland: Scottish Family Health Study
GS:SFHS is a family-structured, population-based cohort recruited at random through
general medical practices across Scotland. The protocol for recruitment is described in
detail elsewhere [24,25]. The cohort consists of 23,960 individuals over 18 y of age who were
recruited if they had at least one other family member willing to participate. Pedigree informa-
tion was available for all participants, and this has subsequently been validated against esti-
mated relatedness using genome-wide single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) data on 19,995
individuals. All individuals from GS:SFHS provided data for the current analyses (median
age = 47.9, 41% male, 59% female), of whom 19,511 also provided genotype data for risk profil-
ing after quality control (mean age = 47.50, standard deviation [SD] = 14.98) (n = 11,514
female, n = 7,997 male).
Using pedigree information in GS:SFHS, we have created variables to represent the random
effect from genetic and environment factors for linear mixed modelling. We created the genetic
relationship matrix using all participants as a means of estimating the heritability of specific
traits and their genetic correlation between trait pairs. In addition, we fitted several variables
in the model to estimate the effects of shared environment. These included measures of com-
mon household, common spouse/partner, and a measure representing siblings that shared a
common parental and sibling environment. Further details of these measures are provided in
S1 Text.
Assessment of Chronic Pain in Generation Scotland
GS:SFHS participants (n = 16955) completed a questionnaire assessment of chronic pain as
previously described by Hocking et al. [26]. This included, first, a validated chronic pain identi-
fication questionnaire, in which chronic pain was ascertained in the event of positive responses
to two questions: (1) Are you currently troubled by pain or discomfort, either all the time or on
and off? (2) Have you had this pain or discomfort for more than 3 months? [27,28] Secondly,
severity of chronic pain was determined by the Chronic Pain Grade (CPG) questionnaire, a val-
idated seven-item instrument that measures the pain intensity and pain-related disability and
grades severity from Grade 1 (low intensity, low disability chronic pain) to Grade 4 (high inten-
sity, high disability, severely limiting chronic pain) [28–30].
Assessments of MDD in Generation Scotland
All GS:SFHS participants were invited to complete a screening questionnaire for MDD, as
described previously [31]. Those screening positive were invited to complete the Structured
Clinical Interview for the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of the American Psychiatric Asso-
ciation (SCID, DSM version 4) and were subsequently diagnosed with MDD if they fulfilled
DSM-IV criteria. Individuals who screened negative for MDD or who screened positive but did
not fulfil criteria were diagnosed as being free from MDD. Individuals who declined to com-
plete the screening questionnaire or the SCID had their MDD status set to missing. Details of
the genotyping and quality control procedures for each cohort are given in the S2 Text.

 500,000 people were recruited from across the UK [32]. For the present study, 112,151 commu-
nity-dwelling individuals (58,914 females, 53,237 males) aged 40 to 73 years (mean = 56.91
years, SD = 7.93) with genome-wide genotyping were available. Individuals were assigned to
self-declared MDD if they stated they had previously suffered from clinical depression in the
past during their nurse-led assessment (variable no. 20002).
Assessment of Chronic Pain in UK Biobank
To identify chronic pain participants were asked, “In the last month have you experienced any
of the following that interfered with your usual activities?: headache, facial pain, neck or shoul-
der pain, back pain, stomach or abdominal pain, hip pain, knee pain, pain all over the body.”
With each positive response, they were asked whether the pain had lasted for at least 3 mo, and
individuals who reported at least one of these pains lasting for at least 3 mo were defined as
having “chronic pain.” Chronic pain in UK Biobank was then quantified based on a previous
report [1], which categorised chronic pain in ascending order based on whether a single site
was affected, two to three sites were affected, or if the pain was widespread and diffuse, affect-
ing four to seven sites or “pain all over the body.” Ninety-three thousand, five hundred and sev-
enty-one individuals provided useable pain data.
Assessments of MDD in UK Biobank
Individuals with probable MDD in UK Biobank were identified using the definition used by
Smith et al. [33]. This definition used information from a touchscreen assessment that included
questions from the Patient Health Questionnaire and items of help-seeking for mental health.
The final sample of individuals used in the current analysis, who provided both probable MDD
and genotyping data, was 27,994 controls and 6,135 with probable major depressive disorder.
Polygenic Profiling
Polygenic profiling estimates an individual's burden of common risk variants for a given trait
by summing trait-associated alleles, weighted by their marker effects, across the genome to cre-
ate a polygenic risk score (PGRS) within each subject. This process requires GWAS summary
statistics from an independent training subset, from which the marker weights (log odds ratio)
and a SNP-list ranked by their evidence for association (usually p-values) can be obtained.
The training set for chronic pain was designed by Pfizer and conducted in collaboration
with 23andMe on their participants. In this Pfizer-23andMe study, validated pain question-
naires, using identical case and severity measures to those used in GS:SFHS, were completed by
>32,000 research participants. 23andMe research participants provided written informed con-
sent to take part in this research under a protocol approved by the Ethical and Independent
Review Services, an AAHRPP-accredited institutional review board. The number of unrelated
Europeans that were included after relatedness removal was 10,780 cases and 12,552 individu-
als categorised as “no pain” controls. Chronic pain phenotypes for 23andMe participants were
defined (as for GS:SFHS). For each pain phenotype, individual SNP effects (odds ratios and
95% CIs) were calculated in PLINK using a linear regression analysis after adjustment for age,
sex, body mass index (BMI), current manual labour and previous manual labour and the first
five population principal components. Further details of the genotyping and quality control
performed by 23andMe are provided in the S2 Text.
Genetic risk of MDD was estimated using published independent GWAS dataset from the
Psychiatric Genomics Consortium (PGC) Major Depressive Disorder Working Group. Details
of the quality control, imputation, and analysis have been previously provided elsewhere [12].

 Chronic pain and MDD polygenic risk profile scores for all individuals in GS:SFHS and
UKB with useable GWAS data were then estimated. Polygenic risk profiles were estimated
genome-wide using four arbitrarily defined nominal p-value thresholds in the original discov-
ery GWAS (p-values = 0.01, 0.05, 0.1 and 0.5) producing a score in a second dataset at each cor-
responding threshold. Statistically significant association of chronic pain in GS:SFHS and UKB
using marker weights estimated in Pfizer-23andMe GWAS data was assumed to infer a poly-
genic risk architecture. Statistically significant association of chronic pain using MDD poly-
genic profile scores (or vice versa) was assumed to infer an overlapping polygenic risk
architecture.
Statistical Analysis
Pedigree-based analysis of chronic pain.
Pedigree-based analysis of chronic pain was
conducted solely in the GS:SFHS dataset using the Chronic Pain Grade (CPG 0–4) variable.
Using a generalised linear mixed-model, we estimated the relative contributions of the random
effect from (1) genetic factors (using the additive genetic [or numerator] relationship matrix)
calculated from the pedigree, and (2) environmental factors from the parent (using the sib vari-
able), previous/current spouse (using the spouse variable), and household (using the two
household variables). The magnitude of each environmental effect (parent, spouse, household)
was estimated in a model with the presence of a genetic variance component to reduce con-
founding of each environmental effect by genetic relatedness. All fixed and random effects
were estimated in the MCMCglmm package for Bayesian Generalised linear mixed models
[34] and in the R package ASReml-R [35] (version 3) in R version 3.2.2. Since MCMCglmm
can adequately model the genetic and environmental contributions to binary and ordinal traits
using Markov Chain Monte Carlo sampling, MCMCglmm was used as the primary methodol-
ogy for estimating the effects sizes for each variance component. Sex, age, and age2 were used
as fixed effects throughout. We checked for adequate coverage of each model estimate by
graphically examining the trace of each parameter. We adjusted for autocorrelation by thinning
the sampling frequency using the “thin” option in MCMCglmm, which was set to 50 samples,
and we used between 85,000 to 500,000 iterations after a burn-in of 15,000 samples. Each
model was run a minimum of three times to check for consistency.
In order to select the best-fitting model to the data, we employed two convergence method-
ologies, one in each software package. Firstly, we estimated goodness-of-fit in the MCMCglmm
package using Deviance Information Criterion (DIC), with larger values indicating poorer fit-
ting models. Secondly, we used ASReml-R to compare goodness-of-fit by estimating the differ-
ence in log-likelihood between two models, which was then compared to a chi-squared
distribution with the relevant degrees of freedom for the number of parameters that differed
between the models. A significant p-value indicated a better fitting model. In each case we
started with a model containing only a genetic effect, then applied models containing the
genetic effects plus one of the three environmental effects (parent, spouse, and household).
After choosing the best model from those estimated, we attempted to improve the model fit by
adding in a second environmental variable. Where the DIC or log-likelihood could not be fur-
ther improved, we selected the reduced model as the best fit for the available data and provided
the effects from MCMCglmm.
Pedigree-based bivariate analyses of pain and MDD.
In order to examine the relation-
ship between chronic pain and MDD in GS:SFHS, we used a generalised linear mixed model as
implemented in ASReml-R. We estimated the “bivariate” phenotypic correlation between
chronic pain and MDD first before providing the genetic correlation coefficient and environ-
mental coefficient for any significant shared environments estimated from the univariate

 model. The genetic correlation coefficient is an estimate of the correlation between the additive
genetic components of chronic pain and MDD. Similarly, the environmental correlation coeffi-
cient estimates correlation between the shared environmental components of chronic pain and
MDD.
The significance of each correlation was estimated using two nested “null” models. The first
null genetic model was constrained to have a genetic correlation of zero, whereas the null envi-
ronmental model was constrained to have an environmental correlation of zero. Each model
was compared to the full (estimated) model and the significance of each effect was determined
using the likelihood ratio test (LRT) by comparing two times the difference in the log likelihood
to a chi-squared distribution with 1 degree of freedom. Standard errors for each correlation
coefficient were also determined using the variance components provided by ASReml-R. In
order to account for relatedness and to adjust for the fixed effects of sex, age, and age2 (i.e., age
squared), the significance of the phenotypic correlation coefficient was estimated using the
ratio of its effect size to its standard error in ASReml-R. The significance was then estimated by
comparison of this figure to a z-distribution and the calculation of a two-tailed p-value.
Polygenic profiling.
Polygenic profiling of the GS:SFHS sample was conducted in PRSice
[36] using the marker weights estimated in the Pfizer-23andMe dataset for the CPG trait in
this independent discovery sample. Details of the numbers of SNPs contributing to each poly-
genic score are given in S2 Table. The polygenic risk scores were first used to test their associa-
tion with chronic pain in GS:SFHS using the profile score as a fixed effect within a generalised
linear mixed model implemented in MCMCglmm. Additionally, sex, age, age2, and four multi-
dimensional scaling components were also used as fixed effects. Each model was adjusted to
take account of relatedness between subjects using the relationship matrix. The significance of
the association between polygenic risk profile scores and chronic pain in GS:SFHS was esti-
mated using the modal value and the 95% credible interval from the posterior density. The var-
iance explained by the polygenic profile score was estimated by multiplying the profile score by
its corresponding regression coefficient and estimating its variance [37] in ASReml-R. This
value was then divided by the variance of the observed phenotype itself to yield a coefficient of
determination between 0 and 1. We then tested for the association between polygenic profile
scores for chronic pain and MDD in GS:SFHS.
We then profiled all individuals in GS:SFHS using the publically available PGC dataset for
MDD. Polygenic profile scores for MDD were then tested for their association with MDD in
GS:SFHS as a means of assessing their validity and to identify a theoretical upper bound for
their accuracy in predicting chronic pain. Secondly, we estimated the strength of the associa-
tion between polygenic profile score for MDD and chronic pain in GS:SFHS using the same
models as described in the previous paragraph.
Where a significant association was found between polygenic risk of chronic pain and either
chronic pain or MDD in GS:SFHS, we repeated the analysis in UKB using their different
chronic pain phenotype which is defined, in contrast to GS:SFHS, on the extent rather than on
the intensity of the chronic pain. Where significant associations were found between polygenic
risk of MDD and chronic pain in GS:SFHS, these analyses were repeated excluding individuals
with major depression (experienced at any point in their life) in order to test whether the same
relationship between polygenic risk of MDD and chronic pain was present in the unaffected
population.
Associations that were shown to be significant in GS:SFHS were then repeated in UKB
using unrelated individuals only. Polygenic risk profile scores were examined for their associa-
tion with observed phenotypes in ASReml-R using the same methods, but without the inclu-
sion of a GRM due to the large dataset and unrelated nature of the filtered UKB study

 Results
Univariate Analysis of Chronic Pain Grade in GS:SFHS
Five models were initially estimated for the chronic pain (CPG) dependent variable. In each
case the model included a genetic effect, then each of the three environmental effects individu-
ally (“sib” [common parent], spouse or household). The model including the additive genetic
effect plus that of spouse was a better fit than the model that only included the additive genetic
effect alone, either by selection of the model with the lowest Deviance Information Criterion
(DIC) or through the likelihood ratio test (LRT). The effect of additive genetic effects and
spouse alone was also superior (in terms of DIC) to either of the other two models that
included additive genetic effects and “sib” alone, or additive genetic effects and household
alone. In a second step, we added further environmental effects to the model that included
additive genetics and spouse alone, but we could not improve on the model fit adjudicated
using either the DIC or LRT. Each model is reported in S1 Table.
The heritability of chronic pain was substantial, accounting for 38.4% (95% CI 33.6% to
43.9%) of the variation in CPG score. Shared environment with a spouse accounted for approx-
imately 18.7% (95% CI 9.5% to 25.1%) of the variation in susceptibility to chronic pain. The
magnitude of this association was approximately half of the variance component explained by
additive genetic factors. The residual unexplained variance, reflecting measurement error, poor
reliability, and non-shared environment, accounted for just under half of the variance in liabil-
ity to chronic pain (variance attributed 42.9%).
Bivariate Analysis of Chronic Pain Grade in GS:SFHS
Chronic Pain was positively correlated in GS:SFHS with MDD (Pearson’s phenotypic correla-
tion: r = 0.13, SE = 0.01, p = 2.72 x10-68). Phenotypic covariance between chronic pain and
MDD was demonstrably attributable to shared genetic architecture (r = 0.51, SE = 0.054,
p = 8.24x10-19) and also to a spouse/partner environmental effect (r = 0.53, SE = 0.24, p = 0.02).
The larger standard errors (SE = 0.24) for the effect of partner/spouse likely reflected the
smaller number of spouse/partners (n = 3,486) and the lower precision in these estimates.
The Associations of Polygenic Risk of Pain on chronic pain in GS:SFHS
and UK Biobank
Polygenic risk profile scores for the Pfizer-23andMe phenotype “Chronic Pain Grade” were sig-
nificantly associated with chronic pain in both the GS:SFHS and UK Biobank samples, at all p-
value thresholds (Table 1 and Fig 1). In each case, the proportion of variance in chronic pain
explained by the polygenic risk score was less than 1%. In contrast, chronic pain polygenic risk
profile scores derived from Pfizer-23andMe marker data were not associated with MDD in GS:
SFHS at even nominal levels of significance (Table 2).
The Association of Polygenic Risk for MDD with MDD Traits in GS:SFHS
and UK Biobank
Polygenic risk profile scores for MDD were estimated in GS:SFHS and UK Biobank using data
from the PGC international consortia. Polygenic risk profile scores for MDD were significantly
positively associated with MDD in GS:SFHS at three out of four thresholds, with the exception
of the pT = 0.01 threshold. In the larger UK Biobank study, polygenic risk of MDD was associ-
ated with MDD at all four p-value thresholds (Table 3).
Having established a relationship between polygenic risk of MDD, MDD in GS:SFHS, and
probable MDD in UK Biobank, we then sought to test the relationship between polygenic risk

 of MDD and chronic pain. Polygenic risk of MDD was associated with chronic pain in GS:
SFHS at three out of four thresholds (Table 4). The threshold of pT = 0.01 did not show a sig-
nificant association with chronic pain in GS:SFHS. This was the same threshold that showed
no association with MDD in the same study.
In order to confirm the novel association between polygenic risk of MDD and pain in GS:
SFHS, we conducted a replication in the UK Biobank sample. In this sample, 121,052 UKB

four thresholds) was positively and significantly associated with each of the pain phenotypes in
UKB (Table 4 and Fig 2).
Discussion
In GS:SFHS, genetic factors and shared spouse/partner environment contributed significantly
to variation in chronic pain. Narrow sense heritability of chronic pain was 38.4%, the effect of
spouse additionally contributed 18.7% to phenotypic variance, and 42.9% of phenotypic vari-
ance was left to residual error and other unknown sources of variation. Chronic pain was also
positively correlated with MDD, and this correlation was due to both shared genetic factors
and to an effect of spouse/partner.
Using data from two independent GWAS studies (Pfizer-23andMe and PGC), polygenic
profile scores for chronic pain were associated with chronic pain traits in both GS:SFHS and
UK Biobank, but not MDD. In contrast, polygenic risk of MDD was positively and significantly
associated with MDD and chronic pain in both GS:SFHS and UK Biobank. In a study with
some similarities to ours, Ligthart et al. [38] calculated genetic risk scores, based on two discov-
ery samples, for migraine and for MDD, and were able to predict “pure” migraine cases and
“comorbid” (migraine and MDD) cases in an independent Dutch sample. This study extends
that earlier work to a broader chronic pain phenotype, in independent samples, using compli-
mentary and convergent methodologies.

 This investigation replicates and extends earlier work showing that chronic pain is a herita-
ble phenotype [39] by demonstrating that there is an independent contribution to risk from
the environment shared by an individual’s partner or spouse. We also demonstrate that chronic
pain has a partly polygenic risk architecture, further supporting analyses aimed at identifying
specific risk-associated variants. Whilst pain is phenotypically and genetically correlated with

 MDD, the added contribution of an affected spouse was also substantial in the current study.
The reasons for this are unclear in the current study, but the findings imply that the presence
of pain in one spouse/partner makes the probability of MDD more likely in the other spouse/
partner. Possible reasons for this include learned behaviours and the effects of caring for some-
one with chronic disabling illness. An alternative explanation is that a spousal correlation rep-
resents the impact of a common recent environment jointly on both spouses. Spouses are a
group who are presumed to have been living together, on the basis of shared children and co-
participation in the study. Their correlation could represent common infectious disease his-
tory, diet, deprivation, hobbies, and a number of as yet unidentified shared factors. In addition,
an effect of assortative mating cannot be excluded.
Whilst tests of genetic correlation imply shared genetic risk factors, they cannot ascertain
the mechanisms of any effect. Similarly, they cannot determine whether the presence of chronic
pain in one individual is associated with a risk of depression in another because of shared mecha-
nisms or because one phenotype is the consequence of the other. Interestingly, in our analyses,
chronic pain was associated with increased genomic risk for MDD. There was, however, no sig-
nificant association of MDD with genomic risk of pain after correction for multiple testing.
These results, whilst they potentially imply a directional association, may, however, be due to
subtle differences in genetic architectures, discovery GWAS sample sizes, GWAS quality-control,
or polygenic risk profiling. It is also possible that a higher genetic risk of MDD lowers the thresh-
old at which pain is perceived or reported, even if an individual does not develop frank psychiat-
ric disorder. The finding of a robust MDD polygenic risk score association with pain is
unexpected, as MDD has (to date) not been particularly tractable to genetic studies. This finding
implies that there is a potentially important genetic relationship between MDD and pain.
Several limitations should be considered when interpreting the findings from this study.
Firstly, response rates to a letter of initial invitation in population-based studies are typically
low (around 12.3% for GS:SFHS [24], 5.5% for UK Biobank [40], and 13.6% for 23andMe).
This may decrease the representativeness of each cohort and could, in theory, bias the effect
size estimates [40]. The Pfizer-23andMe survey was also deployed electronically via email and
on the 23andMe website to the entire 23andMe research participant cohort. Whilst the effects
of this method of participant selection on genetic studies is not known, the ability of Pfizer-
23andMe polygenic pain scores to predict pain scores in two independent cohorts provides
some assurance of consistency with other studies.
Whilst GS:SFHS is a large family-based study, the genetic effect estimated in the pedigree-
based study tends to be inflated by shared environmental factors. Whilst we applied step-wise
model selection to adjust for the effects of shared environment, the effects of environment fac-
tors with small effects could not be completely excluded. Whilst the use of the DIC criterion
for non-Gaussian models is subject to several important limitations [41], the lower DIC values
for the models including spouse only are less dependent on sample size and provide additional
convergent information to the comparison of log-likelihoods. A separate issue to take account
of is the fact that the utility of polygenic risk scores depends largely on the precision of the
marker estimates in the independent discovery set. The precision of these estimates from Pfi-
zer-23andMe and the PGC are dependent upon a number of factors, including sample size,
allele frequency, and heritability. The lack of an association with polygenic risk of chronic pain
and MDD may be due in part to poorly estimated marker effect sizes or to unidentified factors
related to differences in the cohorts. Excluding this possibility may require much larger discov-
ery GWAS sample sizes. However, in contrast to complex phenotypes of comparable heritabil-
ity, GWAS studies of MDD in individuals of European ancestry have so far yielded no
significant findings. It is perhaps surprising, therefore, that risk of MDD should be significantly
associated with chronic pain in both GS:SFHS and UK Biobank. Whilst this finding could be

 due to pleiotropy, or a directional effect of polygenic risk of MDD on pain, there is a possibility
that some cases of MDD are misclassified as chronic pain, or vice versa, leading to inflated esti-
mates of genetic correlation and polygenic association with MDD. Such a misclassification
could occur for a number of reasons, including the voicing or manifestation of distress through
physical rather than psychological language.
Arguably, one potential limitation to the current study is the use of different definitions of
chronic pain and MDD in GS:SFHS and UKB. In spite of this difference, the presence of an
association between polygenic risk of MDD and chronic pain in both cohorts further highlights
the strength and robustness of the pain-MDD relationship. The findings also signpost the
availability of three suitable cohorts (GS:SFHS, UKB and Pfizer-23andMe) of sufficient size
and power in which to conduct molecular genetic studies to better understand the shared
mechanisms of chronic pain and MDD.
The findings from the current investigation imply that efforts to identify genetic and envi-
ronmental risk factors for MDD are likely to be relevant for the study of pain, and vice versa.
We think that future efforts in this field should include a search to identify the risk-conferring
loci contributing to chronic pain and MDD and, thereafter, a search to identify the direction of
the causal mechanisms that link these disorders. The answer to these key questions are likely to
signpost new directions for therapeutic interventions and highlight the symptoms that are
most amenable to treatment, as well as to prevention.
In conclusion, we show here that shared genetic factors and recent shared environment
with a spouse/partner contribute to variation in chronic pain and also to its observed co-occur-
rence with MDD. Our conclusions are made based upon bivariate mixed-model analysis of a
family-based study and on convergent and replicated evidence using polygenic risk scores
from two independent studies.
