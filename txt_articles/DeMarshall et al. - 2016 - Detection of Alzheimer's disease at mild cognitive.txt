Abstract
Introduction: There is an urgent need to identify biomarkers that can accurately detect and diagnose
Alzheimer’s disease (AD). Autoantibodies are abundant and ubiquitous in human sera and have been
previously demonstrated as disease-specific biomarkers capable of accurately diagnosing mild-
moderate stages of AD and Parkinson’s disease.
Methods: Sera from 236 subjects, including 50 mild cognitive impairment (MCI) subjects with
confirmed low CSF Ab42 levels, were screened with human protein microarrays to identify potential
biomarkers for MCI. Autoantibody biomarker performance was evaluated using Random Forest and
Receiver Operating Characteristic curves.
Results: Autoantibody biomarkers can differentiate MCI patients from age-matched and gender-
matched controls with an overall accuracy, sensitivity, and specificity of 100.0%. They were also
capable of differentiating MCI patients from those with mild-moderate AD and other neurologic
and non-neurologic controls with high accuracy.
Discussion: Autoantibodies can be used as noninvasive and effective blood-based biomarkers for
early diagnosis and staging of AD.

s & Dementia: Diagnosis, Assessment & Disease Monitoring 3 (2016) 51-62
 1. Introduction
AD is a devastating and progressive neurodegenerative
disease affecting approximately 5.3 million people in the
United States, including almost half of the population at
85 years and older [1,2]. Microscopic hallmarks of the
disease include neuritic plaques containing amyloid beta
peptide (Ab42) and neurofibrillary tangles composed of
hyperphosphorylated tau [3]. Despite intensive research
throughout the past two decades, a clear understanding of
AD pathogenesis remains elusive and controversial. At
best, current treatments only temporarily alleviate some
symptoms and provide no relief for the pathology [4]. One
point of agreement is that, in a high percentage of those
afflicted, AD-related pathologic changes begin in the brain
at least a decade before the emergence of telltale symptoms
and clinical presentation [5–10]. This makes it difficult to
identify AD patients at early, pre-symptomatic disease
stages, at a time when treatments are likely to be most
beneficial. In view of this, intensive research is underway
worldwide to discover and develop accurate, reliable, and
cost-effective methods for early AD detection that can be
widely implemented.
Much effort is being devoted to identification of soluble
components in blood and cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) that
can serve as useful and reliable AD biomarkers [11]. In
CSF, the most established biomarkers include Ab42, total
tau, and phosphorylated tau (p-tau) and their relative ratios
[12–17]. Low CSF Ab42 levels in individuals with mild
cognitive impairment (MCI) are now considered to be
strongly indicative of the presence of early ongoing AD
pathology as well as predictive of the likelihood of rapid
disease progression to AD [18–24]. A key limitation to the
use of CSF in general is the means by which it is obtained,
through a lumbar spinal puncture, which is considered
invasive and
not
without
risk
[25,26].
By
contrast,
procurement of blood is less invasive, and plasma proteins
[27–29], lipids [30] as well as proteins and microRNAs
enclosed within exosomes and lysosomal derivatives have
all shown promise as biomarkers for early detection of AD
pathology [31,32]. Parallel advancements for early AD
detection have been made in neuroimaging, such as
magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and positron emission
tomography (PET) using tracers like Florbetapir (18F),
Pittsburgh compound B (PiB), and fluorodeoxyglucose.
The high cost of these procedures and inconsistencies in
interpretation
prohibits
their
use
as
initial
disease
screeners, and they may not be readily available to
individuals in economically disadvantaged areas or remote
geographical locations.
Using human protein microarrays as a platform, we have
shown that humans possess thousands of autoantibodies in
their blood, and that individual autoantibody profiles are
influenced by age, gender, and the presence of disease
[33]. Previous studies have suggested that autoantibodies
may be useful as biomarkers for detection of neurodegener-
ative diseases, including AD and Parkinson’s diseases (PD)
[34–37]. Ultimately, the practical utility of potential
biomarkers
depends
on
their
capacity
to
accurately,
specifically and reliably detect these diseases at early
stages. Recently, we showed that a small panel of only
four autoantibodies was sufficient to identify individuals
with early-stage PD, as well as distinguish them from
healthy individuals and others with mild-moderate PD
[37]. In addition, these early PD biomarkers exhibited dis-
ease specificity by distinguishing subjects with early-stage
PD from those with other neurodegenerative diseases, such
as MCI, mild-moderate AD, multiple sclerosis, and early-
stage breast cancer [37].
In the present study involving 236 subjects, our objective
was to determine if autoantibodies can be used as bio-
markers to accurately diagnose individuals with MCI that
is driven by early stages of AD pathology. We obtained
sera from MCI subjects exhibiting low CSF AB42 from
the Alzheimer’s Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI).
Low CSFAB42 levels have been shown to be an independent
surrogate biochemical biomarker indicative of the presence
of ongoing early-stage AD pathology and a high likelihood
of rapid progression to AD [38–40]. Our results show that a
small panel of blood-borne autoantibody biomarkers can be
used to distinguish subjects with AD-associated MCI from
age-matched and gender-matched controls with an overall
accuracy of 100%. In addition, MCI subjects were success-
fully differentiated from those with mild-moderate AD with
similar overall accuracy, suggesting that this approach may
also be useful for delineation of discrete disease stages along
the MCI-to-AD continuum. Finally, the panel of AD-
associated MCI biomarkers described here was highly
specific for MCI in that they accurately distinguished AD-
associated MCI subjects from those with other neurodegen-
erative and non-neurodegenerative diseases, including early
and mild-moderate PD, multiple sclerosis, and early-stage
breast cancer.
2. Methods
2.1. Study population
Clinical, biochemical, and imaging data on MCI subjects
used here were obtained from the ADNI database at www.
loni.ucla.edu/ADNI. Our study was focused on 50 ADNI
participants who were diagnosed with amnestic MCI at base-
line and had at least one follow-up visit (Table 1). All sub-
jects enrolled in the ADNI were aged 55–91 years and had
no evidence of cerebrovascular disease (Modified Hachinski
Ischemia Score � 4) [41], no evidence of depression (Geri-
atric Depression Scale ,6 [42], stable medications, a study
partner, no visual or hearing impairment, good general
health, six grades of education or equivalent, English
or Spanish fluency, and no medical contraindications to
MRI. This included baseline data from individuals diag-
nosed with MCI with available neuropsychological test

s & Dementia: Diagnosis, Assessment & Disease Monitoring 3 (2016) 51-62
52
 results, apolipoprotein E (APOE) status, CSF proteins,
18F-fluorodeoxyglucose PET, and structural MRI scans. In
the ADNI samples, MCI was defined based on the following
criteria: memory complaint verified by study partner;
abnormal memory function based on education-adjusted
cut-off on the Logical Memory II subscale from the Wechs-
ler Memory Scale revised (Wechsler D. Wechsler Memory
Scale-revised. San Antonio, TX: Psychological Corporation;
1987), MMSE [43] score of 24–30 (inclusive), Clinical
Dementia Rating [44] score of 0.5, and cognitive and func-
tional impairment not yet severe enough to meet criteria
for AD or dementia.
The ADNI was launched in 2003 by the National Institute
on Aging, the National Institute of Biomedical Imaging and
Bioengineering, the Food and Drug Administration, private
pharmaceutical companies, and non-profit organizations, as
a $60 million, 5-year, public-private partnership. The pri-
mary goal of ADNI has been to test whether serial MRI,
PET, and other biological markers, and clinical and neuro-
psychological assessments can be combined to measure
the progression of MCI and early AD. Determination of sen-
sitive and specific markers of very early AD progression is
intended to aid researchers and clinicians to develop new
treatments and monitor their effectiveness, as well as to
lessen the time and cost of clinical trials.
The principal investigator of this initiative is Michael W.
Weiner, VA Medical Center and University of California,
San Francisco. ADNI is the result of the efforts of many
co-investigators from a broad range of academic institutions
and private corporations, and subjects have been recruited
from more than 50 sites across the United States and Canada.
The initial goal of ADNI was to recruit 800 adults, aged 55 to
90 years, to participate in the research approximately 200
cognitively normal older individuals to be followed for
3 years and 200 people with early AD to be followed for
2 years. For up-to-date information, see www.adni-info.org.
Participants with MCI were enrolled based on criteria
outlined in the ADNI protocol (http://www.adni-info.org/
Scientists/AboutADNI.aspx). Demographic data are pre-
sented in Table 1. The study was approved by the Rowan
University Institutional Review Board.
Fifty MCI serum samples from subjects with confirmed
low CSF Ab42 levels were obtained. These came from sub-
jects participating in the ADNI2 study, which is an ongoing
longitudinal study with the goal of identifying individuals
at risk for Alzheimer’s disease, as well as the development
of diagnostic and prognostic biomarkers of the disease
[45]. Diagnosis of MCI was made based on a battery of
tests, including MMSE scores, CDR, and other subjective
memory assessments [45]. Twenty-five early-stage PD
samples were obtained from the Parkinson’s Study Group
(Boston, MA). Twenty-five mild-moderate PD and 50
mild-moderate AD serum samples were obtained from
Analytical Biological Systems, Inc. (Wilmington, DE).
Eleven stage 0–2 breast cancer serum samples were ob-
tained from Asterand, Inc. (Detroit, MI), and 25 multiple
sclerosis (MS) patient serum samples were obtained from
BioServe Biotechnologies Ltd (Beltsville, MD). Healthy
age-matched and gender-matched control sera were ob-
tained from several sources: 27 from BioServe Biotechnol-
ogies Ltd.; 11 from Asterand Inc.; 9 from The New Jersey
Institute for Successful Aging at Rowan University (Strat-
ford, NJ); and three from Analytical Biological Systems,
Inc. All samples were handled using standard procedures
and stored at 280�C until use. Stored samples were moni-
tored using Sensaphone 1400 (Phonetics, Inc., Aston, PA).
Demographic characteristics of the study population are
listed in Table 1.
2.2. Human protein microarrays
To detect and identify autoantibodies in human sera, we
used Invitrogen’s ProtoArray v5.0 Human Protein Microar-
rays (Cat. No. PAH0525020, Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA,
USA), each containing 9486 unique human protein antigens
(www.invitrogen.com/protoarray). All proteins were ex-
pressed as glutathione s-transferase (GST) fusion proteins
in insect cells, purified under native conditions, and spotted
in duplicate onto nitrocellulose-coated glass slides. Arrays
were probed with serum, processed and scanned according
to the manufacturer’s instructions. Briefly, microarrays
were blocked using Blocking Buffer (Cat. No. PA055, Invi-
trogen) and each was incubated with serum diluted to 1:500
in washing buffer. After washing, arrays were probed with
antihuman IgG (H 1 L) conjugated to AlexaFluor 647
(Cat. No. A-21445, Invitrogen) diluted 1:2000 in washing

 buffer. Arrays were then washed, dried, and immediately
scanned with a GenePix 4000B Fluorescence Scanner (Mo-
lecular Devices, Sunnyvale, CA, USA).
2.3. Microarray data analysis
Fluorescence data were acquired by aligning the Genepix
Array List onto the microarray using the Genepix Pro
analysis software. The resulting Genepix results files were
imported into Invitrogen’s Prospector 5.2 for analysis. The
“group characterization” and “two-group comparison”
features in the Immune Response Biomarker Profiling
(IRBP) toolbox within Prospector then enabled M-statistical
analysis of differential autoantibody expression between the
two groups (Supplementary Fig. 1). Positive hits were deter-
mined by a Z-Factor .0.4, and a minimum signal intensity
of 1500 RFU, which allows for stringent biomarker selection
and minimizes the amount of false positives. Autoantibodies
were sorted into descending order by difference of
prevalence between MCI and control groups, and the top
50 most differentially expressed autoantibodies in the MCI
group were chosen as potential diagnostic biomarkers. All
data are MIAME compliant and raw data from the
microarrays have been deposited in a MIAME compliant
database (GEO) under accession number GSE74763.
Subjects were randomly split into Testing and Training
Sets such that both sets included cases and controls matched
by age and gender. The Training Set was used to rank candi-
date protein biomarkers by their predictive power and to
establish the diagnostic logic. The initial Training Set for
MCI consisted of 25 MCI and 25 control samples; the remain-
ing samples were relegated to the independent Testing Set,
thus also 25 MCI and 25 control subjects. We estimated the
optimum number of autoantibody biomarkers, defined here
as the minimum number of autoantibody biomarkers required
to maintain maximum diagnostic accuracy for this population
of MCI subjects. To accomplish this, we first compared the
predictive capacity of the top 25 and bottom 25 biomarkers
and then determined the efficacy of the top 10 alone using
the original Training Set logic. In each case, the predictive
classification accuracy of the selected biomarkers in the
Training Set, Testing Set, and in both sets combined was
tested with R’s Random Forest (RF; v 4.6–10), using the
default settings [46,47]. Selected biomarkers were tested
with the RF model algorithm, and classification accuracy is
reported in a confusion matrix and misclassifications as an
out-of-bag (OOB) error score. Receiver Operating Character-
istic (ROC) curves, widely used to evaluate the utility of a
diagnostic test, were generated using R (3.02) packages
ROCR (v 1.0-5) and pROC (v 1.7.3) [48]. Based on the deter-
mined optimal number of biomarkers, a final model was con-
structed using these biomarkers and their associated Training
Set logic and tested with the independent Testing Set.
Using the same Training and Testing Set strategy outlined
above, we performed an additional round of biomarker
discovery using only RF, instead of prevalence difference,
to select potential biomarkers. After M-statistical analysis
by Prospector, the data were analyzed using the “variable
importance” function in RF, which is the prediction accuracy
of the OOB error score reported for each tree, and also for
each individual permutated biomarker. The difference
between the two values was averaged over all trees and
normalized by the standard error. The top 50 biomarkers
based on the normalized variable importance score were
chosen as potential diagnostic biomarkers and further
analyzed for their diagnostic value as reported above.
3. Results
3.1. Selection of a panel of autoantibody biomarkers for
AD-associated MCI diagnosis
We first sought to identify a panel of autoantibodies
capable of detecting early-stage AD pathology using
50 ADNI MCI patient sera, all with low CSF AB42 levels
consistent
with
the
presence
of
ongoing
AD-related
pathology (from now on referred to as AD-associated
MCI; Supplementary Fig. 2) and each with a clinical
diagnosis of either early MCI (EMCI, n 5 32) or late MCI
(LMCI, n 5 18), a distinction based on education-adjusted
cut-off scores on the logical memory II subscale from the
Wechsler Memory Scale revised, previously mentioned.
These sera, along with those obtained from age-matched
and
gender-matched
controls,
were
used
to
probe
commercially available human protein microarrays contain-
ing 9486 proteins. First, samples were separated into
Training and Testing Sets (Supplementary Fig. 1) each
containing 25 ADNI MCI sera (16 EMCI 1 9 LMCI) and
25
age-matched
and
gender-matched
controls.
The
resulting individual autoantibody profiles for Training Set
MCI subjects were compared with those of controls
using Prospector analysis software. We identified 193
autoantibodies with a significantly (P , .05) higher
prevalence in the MCI group compared to controls in the
Training Set as potential diagnostic biomarkers. From this
list, the top 50 most differentially expressed autoantibodies
in the MCI group were chosen as a working diagnostic
biomarker panel (Supplementary Table 1).
3.2. Verification of AD-associated MCI biomarkers via
Training and Testing Set analysis
The top 50 MCI autoantibody biomarkers chosen from
the Training Set were re-verified as significant predictors
using Random Forest (RF). On RF evaluation of the Training
Set samples (n 5 50; 25 MCI, 25 controls) using the 50
selected biomarkers, MCI subjects were distinguished
from age-matched and gender-matched controls with an
average of 99.6% prediction accuracy based on five replicate
runs. We then used these 50 biomarkers and the RF Training
Set logic to classify MCI in Testing Set subjects, comprised
of a completely independent group of samples that played no
role in biomarker selection. RF was able to correctly classify

s & Dementia: Diagnosis, Assessment & Disease Monitoring 3 (2016) 51-62
54
 100% of MCI and controls among Testing Set subjects
(n 5 50; 25 MCI, 25 controls; Table 2). Combining both
Training and Testing Set samples and using the Training
Set logic, RF successfully distinguished MCI from controls
with no error (Supplementary Fig. 1). The diagnostic
utility of this panel of 50 MCI biomarkers was also
evaluated using ROC curve analysis of Testing Set subjects
(Fig. 1A). The ROC area under the curve (AUC) for this
comparison was 1, indicating exceptional classification
accuracy (Table 3). Diagnostic sensitivity, specificity, and
positive- and negative-predictive values (PPV and NPV)
for the 50 MCI biomarkers used to evaluate the Testing
Set subjects are shown in Tables 2 and 3.
3.3. Exchanging Training and Testing Sets yields similar
biomarker panels with comparable diagnostic accuracy
As a further test of the utility of autoantibodies as
biomarkers for detecting AD pathology in MCI patients,
we also carried out a second round of biomarker discovery
in which we exchanged the Training and Testing Sets and
compared the resulting, second round biomarkers with
those chosen in the first round. Using the panel of
50 second round biomarkers, RF was able to correctly
classify 98% of MCI and controls using Testing Set subjects
(sensitivity 5 96.0%; specificity 5 100.0%; PPV 5 100.0%;
NPV 5 96.2%; ROC AUC 5 1). Importantly, 26 of 50 (52%)
second round biomarkers overlapped with those chosen in
the first round.
3.4. Comparison of MCI biomarker selection strategies:
RF vs. prevalence difference
We next carried out a completely different and unbiased
MCI biomarker selection process using RF only. Here,
instead of first ranking potential MCI biomarkers based on
prevalence difference, we uploaded data from Prospector
directly into R and asked RF to independently choose the

Diagnostic performance was assessed using RF. Using Testing Set samples, RF successfully distinguished AD-associated MCI subjects (n 5 25) from age-

high overall accuracies.

markers can be used to accurately distinguish these two different stages of AD progression. The ROC AUC, sensitivity, and specificity values for the 50 bio-
markers are shown in Table 3.

 top 50 MCI biomarkers as described in the methods. As
shown in Supplementary Table 2, using the panel of 50
RF-selected biomarkers, RF was able to correctly classify
MCI and controls in Testing Set subjects with an average
of 100% overall accuracy in five replicate runs, thus
comparable
to
both
panels
derived
from
prevalence
difference described above. Importantly, 19 of 50 (38%) of
the RF-selected biomarkers overlapped with those chosen
in the first round. Because this is a small and preliminary
“proof of concept” study, and there were no significant
performance differences between the three different MCI
biomarker panels described thus far, we opted to choose
the first biomarker panel described in Supplementary
Table 1 for subsequent studies and comparisons.
3.5. Fewer than 50 autoantibody biomarkers are sufficient
for accurate detection of AD-associated MCI
The top 50 first round biomarkers sorted according
to
decreasing
prevalence
difference
are
shown
in
Supplementary Table 1. We next compared the relative diag-
nostic accuracy of the top and bottom 25 biomarkers within
this selected panel for detecting AD-associated MCI in
Testing Set subjects. Results showed an overall accuracy
of 100% for the top 25 biomarkers (sensitivity 5 100.0%;
specificity 5 100.0%; ROC AUC 5 1) and 98.0% for the
bottom
25
biomarkers
(sensitivity
5
100.0%;
specificity 5 96.0%; ROC AUC 5 1) for distinguishing
MCI
subjects
from
corresponding
age-matched
and
gender-matched controls (Tables 4 and 5). Next, the top 10
biomarkers were tested independently and showed an
overall
accuracy
of
98.0%
(sensitivity
5
96.0%;
specificity 5 100.0%; ROC AUC 5 1), suggesting that a
small panel with roughly 10 biomarkers may be sufficient
to achieve maximal overall accuracy (Tables 4 and 5).

 3.6. Disease specificity of the selected biomarkers for
AD-associated MCI
We next evaluated the disease specificity of the panels of
the top 50 and 10 autoantibody biomarkers for the detection
of AD-associated MCI, i.e., whether they can successfully
differentiate ADNI MCI subjects from those with other
neurological and non-neurological diseases. To eliminate
the possibility that the selected biomarkers were simply de-
tecting nonspecific CNS degeneration, the same 25 MCI
serum samples from Testing Set subjects were compared
to sera obtained from 25 subjects with early-stage PD, 25
subjects with mild-moderate PD, 25 subjects with MS, and
11 subjects with stage 0–2 breast cancer. Using the original
panel of 50 biomarkers, MCI sera were readily distinguished
from early-stage PD sera with an overall accuracy of 98.0%
(sensitivity 5 100.0%; specificity 5 96.0%; ROC AUC 5 1)
and 96.0% for mild-moderate PD (sensitivity 5 96.0%;
specificity 5 96.0%; ROC AUC 5 1) (Tables 2 and 3).
Similarly, this biomarker panel was able to distinguish
ADNI MCI subjects from MS and stage 0–2 breast cancer
subjects with comparable overall accuracy (Tables 2 and
3). Similar results were obtained using only the top 10
biomarkers (Tables 4 and 5).
Finally, to further assess the specificity of the selected
biomarkers for MCI, we asked if these biomarkers could
be used to differentiate the same neurologic and non-
neurologic diseases mentioned previously from a group of
normal control subjects. Using the panel of the top 50
MCI biomarkers along with their associated logic, RF was
unable to successfully differentiate any of the disease groups
from the control group, as indicated by the ROC curve
analyses shown in Supplementary Fig. 3. These results
clearly demonstrate the specificity of the top 50 biomarkers
for AD-associated MCI, ruling out the possibility that they
are nonspecific for CNS neurodegeneration or disease in
general.
3.7. Staging of AD: autoantibody biomarkers can
distinguish ADNI AD-associated MCI subjects from those
with mild-moderate AD
We next asked if autoantibody biomarkers can be used to
distinguish different stages of AD. To address this, we used
our original panel of 50 biomarkers (Supplementary
Table 1) and the RF logic derived from the Training Set to
test whether 25 ADNI Testing Set MCI samples could be
distinguished from 50 subjects with mild-moderate AD.
The latter were randomly split into two groups of 25 each
and compared to the same Testing Set of 25 MCI samples,
and the average overall accuracy from both runs was 98.7%
(Table 2). ROC curve analyses of all these comparisons are
presented in Fig. 1B along with sensitivity, specificity, PPV,
and NPV (Table 3). Taken together, these results confirm
that, although AD-associated MCI and mild-moderate AD
are different stages of the same disease and are expected to
share biomarkers, the panel of 50 autoantibody biomarkers
for MCI selected here along with its corresponding diag-
nostic logic was capable of differentiating AD-associated
MCI from a more pathologically advanced stage of AD.
In addition to the 50 MCI-specific biomarkers, we
also sought to determine if biomarkers specific to mild-
moderate AD could distinguish between these two discreet
stages of the disease. To test this, 50 mild-moderate AD

 samples were compared to the same group of 50 control
samples used for discovery of MCI biomarkers, using the
same Training/Testing Set strategy as before. The top 50
most differentially expressed autoantibody biomarkers in
mild-moderate AD subjects compared to controls were
selected and verified as significant using the methods
described above. Using this set of 50 mild-moderate
AD biomarkers, MCI was readily distinguished from
mild-moderate AD with an overall accuracy, sensitivity,
and specificity of 100.0% (data not shown). Comparison
of the top 50 biomarkers for MCI and mild-moderate AD
revealed an overlap of 5 biomarkers, or 10% of the total
biomarkers (data not shown), thus confirming the expected
presence of common biomarkers between these disease
stages.
3.8. Sera from patients classified by ADNI as early and
late MCI were indistinguishable
Among the 50 MCI sera obtained from the ADNI, 32
were classified as early MCI (EMCI) and 18 as late MCI
(LMCI), a distinction based on assessments as part of the
ADNI2 protocol. After the successful differentiation of
MCI from mild-moderate AD using separate panels of
both MCI-specific and mild-moderate AD-specific bio-
markers, we then asked if we could use a similar strategy
to generate biomarker panels that could distinguish be-
tween EMCI and LMCI. Thirty-two EMCI and 18 LMCI
samples were each compared to the same group of 25 con-
trols that were used to generate a panel of the top 50 most
differentially expressed autoantibodies for each group.
Among the top 50 biomarkers for EMCI and LMCI, 34
(68%) were found to overlap. Overlapping biomarkers
were then removed, and the remaining 16 biomarkers
unique to each stage were then tested in an attempt to differ-
entiate EMCI subjects from those with LMCI. Each panel
was separately tested using RF, which was unable to differ-
entiate between the two MCI subgroups with ,40% overall
error in both instances (data not shown). The significant
overlap of biomarkers in the EMCI and LMCI biomarker
panels and our inability to correctly distinguish EMCI
and LMCI suggest that there is little or no detectable path-
ologic difference between these two stages. This conclu-
sion is further supported by the fact that both EMCI and
LMCI
subjects
had
comparable
CSF
Ab42
levels
(Supplementary Fig. 2), a biomarker known to be indicative
of ongoing early AD pathology and strongly predictive of
conversion from MCI to AD.
4. Discussion
The goals of this study were to determine if autoanti-
bodies can be used effectively as blood-based biomarkers
to identify individuals diagnosed with MCI due to ongoing
early-stage AD pathology (AD-associated MCI) and to
distinguish these MCI individuals from subjects with a
more advanced stage of AD or other neurodegenerative
and non-neurodegenerative diseases. This study resulted
in five main findings. First, we demonstrate that a panel
of autoantibodies can be used to distinguish individuals
with MCI linked to early-stage AD pathology from healthy
age-matched and gender-matched controls with high over-
all accuracy. The subjects used were diagnosed with MCI
by ADNI investigators and were selected because they
also exhibit low CSFAb42 levels. The latter has been estab-
lished as a reliable surrogate biochemical biomarker indic-
ative of ongoing early AD pathology and a high likelihood
of imminent further progression and transition to full-
blown
AD.
Second,
implementation
of
independent
biomarker
discovery
strategies
was
found
to
yield
biomarker panels showing substantial overlap of selected
autoantibody
biomarkers
and
comparable
diagnostic
performance outcomes. Third, the selected panel of AD-
associated MCI biomarkers and its accompanying diag-
nostic logic were disease stage specific in that it was
possible to differentiate MCI subjects from individuals at
a more advanced (mild-moderate) stage of AD. Fourth,
these biomarkers were also disease-specific as they were
capable of distinguishing MCI subjects from those with
early or mild-moderate stage PD, MS, and early-stage
breast cancer. Finally, these biomarkers were unsuccessful
in distinguishing subjects with more subtle clinical desig-
nations that are not rooted in significant differences in the
extent of pathology.
In a recent study, we used human protein microarrays
to demonstrate that autoantibodies can serve as useful
blood-based biomarkers to distinguish patients with
early-stage PD from healthy age-matched and gender-
matched control subjects [37]. Results from 398 subjects,
including 103 early-stage PD subjects derived from the
Deprenyl
and
Tocopherol
Antioxidative
Therapy
of
Parkinsonism (DATATOP) study, showed that a panel of
as few as four autoantibody biomarkers can distinguish
subjects with early-stage PD from matched controls
with an overall accuracy of 87.9%. These biomarkers
also differentiated patients with early-stage PD from
those with more advanced, mild-moderate PD with an
overall accuracy of 97.5% and could also distinguish sub-
jects with early-stage PD from those with other neurolog-
ical (e.g., Alzheimer’s disease and multiple sclerosis) and
non-neurological
(e.g.,
breast
cancer)
diseases
with
comparable accuracies.
In the present study, we analyzed sera from 236 sub-
jects, including 50 derived from patients diagnosed with
MCI by ADNI investigators that also demonstrated low
CSF Ab42 levels, a feature consistent with the presence
of ongoing AD-related pathology and a high likelihood
of rapid transition to AD [49,50]. In these MCI patients,
a much larger volume of brain tissue is expected to be
involved in the pathology compared to that in early-stage
PD subjects, where the pathology is initially confined to
the substantia nigra and surrounding regions. For this

s & Dementia: Diagnosis, Assessment & Disease Monitoring 3 (2016) 51-62

 reason and in the context of the results obtained for early-
stage PD described above, we expected to achieve the same
or better overall accuracy for detection of AD-associated
MCI. This expectation was realized using the MCI autoan-
tibody biomarkers identified in the present study, which
showed 100% overall accuracy in the Testing Set in
distinguishing AD-associated MCI subjects from matched
controls. This result is in agreement with our earlier study
showing that autoantibodies can be used to distinguish
individuals
with
mild-moderate
AD
from
matched
controls as well as the studies of Restrepo et al. and
Reddy et al. [34,51]. The latter group used the affinity of
autoantibodies for peptoid microarrays and showed that
specific autoantibody binding patterns could be used to
diagnose AD. In fact, there now exists a rapidly growing
literature
spanning
many
fields
reporting
the
identification of specific autoantibodies associated with a
wide
variety
of
diseases.
In
many
cases,
these
autoantibodies
are
being
pursued
as
diagnostic
biomarkers for these diseases, and it is now becoming
increasingly clear that these are not just isolated cases
where
autoantibodies
are
somehow
related
to
the
presence of disease. We have recently proposed that
the presence of these autoantibodies are instead reflecting
the immune system’s natural response to disease as part
of the body’s attempt to clear debris generated by the
disease from the blood [33,52]. Additional studies are
needed to test this possibility.
To fully test all 50 ADNI MCI subjects, we also
exchanged Training and Testing Set subjects, carried out
a second round of biomarker discovery and compared
the resulting new biomarkers with those chosen in the first
round. Using the panel of 50 second round biomarkers,
RF was able to correctly classify 98% of MCI and
matched controls in the new Testing Set subjects. Many
of the newly selected biomarkers in this second round
overlapped with first round biomarkers, thus reaffirming
their selection and their utility for detection of early-
stage AD pathology associated with MCI. In addition,
as an independent and completely unbiased method of
AD-associated biomarker selection, we recruited RF to
choose the top 50 autoantibody biomarkers using the
data uploaded directly from Prospector into R. In five
replicate runs, the panel of 50 RF-selected biomarkers
correctly classified MCI and control Testing Set subjects
with an average of 100% overall accuracy, thus showing
results comparable to both the first and second round
autoantibody biomarker panels derived from prevalence
difference. Also, it is noteworthy that 19 and 15 of the
top 50 RF-selected biomarkers overlapped with those
chosen via prevalence difference in the first and second
rounds of biomarker discovery, respectively.
We also preliminarily addressed the question of how
many autoantibody biomarkers are required for accurate
detection of AD-associated MCI by sorting the top 50
biomarkers according to greatest prevalence difference
and then comparing the diagnostic performance of the
top 25 and bottom 25 biomarkers on this list. Results
revealed only a slight reduction in overall diagnostic accu-
racy from 100% to 98% for the bottom 25 biomarkers,
with the top 10 biomarkers showing an overall accuracy
of 98%. These results suggest that most of the top 50
biomarkers are potentially useful as diagnostic indicators
and that a smaller panel of 10–15 biomarkers may be
sufficient for accurate detection and diagnosis of AD-
associated MCI. Of course, final selection of the most use-
ful biomarkers and a proper determination of the number
necessary to achieve consistently accurate detection of
AD-associated MCI will require a much larger verification
study carried out on a broader subject population.
To investigate the possibility that the chosen AD-
associated
MCI
biomarkers
might
have
potential
application for distinguishing different stages of disease
progression, we tested their capacity to differentiate
patients with MCI from those with more advanced
(mild-moderate) AD. Results showed that this distinction
was made with an overall accuracy of 98.5%, suggesting
that this MCI biomarker panel along with its correspond-
ing RF diagnostic logic is specific for early-stage AD
associated with MCI. The ability to distinguish different
stages or phases of disease progression is a highly
desirable feature because it would offer physicians the
possibility of monitoring the progress of their patients
while under treatment. It would also be invaluable for
early enrollment into clinical trials for new therapies
where slowing of disease progression would be evidenced
by a delayed transition from one phase to the next.
Of course, as with any disease-associated biomarkers,
it is critical to demonstrate that the chosen biomarkers
are disease specific. This is especially true for neurode-
generative diseases in which the cell types involved in
the pathology closely resemble one another. Here, we
show that the AD-associated MCI biomarkers were
capable of distinguishing ADNI MCI subjects from those
with other neurologic (e.g., PD and MS) and non-
neurologic (e.g., breast cancer) diseases with exception-
ally high accuracy. However, these biomarkers are not
useful for distinguishing other neurologic and non-
neurologic diseases from controls, thus further confirming
their specificity for MCI (Supplementary Fig. 3). At
disease stages where telltale symptoms are evident, this
need
for
disease
specificity
may
be
less
stringent.
However, as the use of blood-based biomarkers, including
autoantibodies, moves into prodromal disease phases that
lack the crutch of “telltale” symptoms, the requirement
for disease specificity will become particularly stringent.
Additionally, when symptoms of different pathologic
conditions resemble those of MCI, such as drug side-
effects, poor vascular perfusion of the brain, and chronic
depression, these biomarkers will be useful in accurately
diagnosing those patients with MCI due only to ongoing
AD-related pathology.

 The autoantibody biomarker panel used here to distin-
guish patients with AD-associated MCI from matched
controls is presented in Supplementary Table 1. The con-
stituent biomarkers comprise many categories including
kinases, potassium channel subunits, ribosomal and mito-
chondrial proteins, as well as a variety of receptor,
adapter, and other accessory proteins, and cytoskeletal
components, among others. Based on available informa-
tion from database searches, proposed functions of some
of
the
selected
biomarkers
include
cell
signaling,
RNA modification, protein modification, regulation of
apoptosis,
hematopoiesis,
neuron
polarization,
axon
regeneration, synaptic vesicle trafficking, cell prolifera-
tion and migration, various inflammatory processes, and
many more. As was also true for our previous study
describing early-stage PD biomarkers, at first glance,
there is a surprising lack of well-known or “usual-sus-
pect” proteins in the list of top biomarkers for AD-
associated MCI. Although such expectations represent a
bias and may reflect a perception that we understand the
pathogenic mechanisms of AD better than we do in real-
ity, it is noteworthy to point out that we are working under
the assumption that the autoantibodies being detected are
produced by the immune system in response to the release
of debris from the site(s) of pathology in the brain.
This study has a number of strengths. The first is that it
describes a blood-based diagnostic approach that is inde-
pendent of symptoms and, because all MCI subjects also
possess low CSF Ab42 levels, presumably linked directly
to ongoing pathology. Given that AD has a long prodro-
mal period that may extend for more than a decade during
which the pathologic changes are well underway, the use
of autoantibodies as biomarkers for AD may open the
door to pre-symptomatic detection. Another strength is
that this approach takes advantage of the body’s own
response to the presence of pathology. Unlike many blood
proteins and lipids, antibodies are unusually stable in the
blood, a fact which ensures that their production and
detection will be largely independent of circadian as
well as day to day production variations. Also, it is note-
worthy to highlight that the biomarker selection process
used here is unbiased and that multiple biomarker discov-
ery strategies yielded comparable results and overlapping
biomarker panels, providing additional confirmation of
the utility of specific autoantibodies as diagnostic indica-
tors of AD-associated MCI. We have taken advantage of
recent progress in human protein microarray technology
which has allowed us to use a very large number of poten-
tial protein targets (nearly 10,000 in this case) and cast as
wide a net as possible in an effort to identify potentially
useful autoantibody biomarkers. This has also helped us
to gain a better appreciation for the complexity of individ-
ual autoantibody profiles that are typically present in
human blood. Rather than selecting the biomarkers based
on a highly restricted subset of likely favorites, we were
able to compare the expression levels of thousands of
autoantibodies among groups of diseased and nondiseased
individuals in an unbiased fashion and identify those that
are differentially expressed among the two groups and
thus represent potentially useful diagnostic indicators.
Additional strengths of this study are the demonstration
of disease specificity, especially in the context of other
neurodegenerative diseases, and the ability to distinguish
different pathologic stages of the disease. For the latter,
a much larger study using clinically well-characterized
samples (imaging data, CSF, blood work, neuropsycho-
logical tests, and so forth) and appropriate matched con-
trols will be necessary to validate this capability and
determine the number of stages that can be properly delin-
eated. Finally, in support of their direct link to disease
pathology, our data suggest that autoantibodies cannot
be effectively used to discriminate between disease stages
that do not exhibit substantial differences in the site and/
or extent of pathology, as was shown to be the case in our
failed attempt to distinguish patients designated by ADNI
as EMCI and LMCI.
This study has several weaknesses, the most obvious of
which is that it is a very small study intended to be a
“proof of concept” study that was focused on addressing
the question of whether autoantibodies can potentially
be used as biomarkers to detect early-stage AD pathology
in patients diagnosed with MCI. As such, it is important to
note that the data are limited to this group of ADNI MCI
subjects, and it is acknowledged that much larger studies
will be needed to determine the utility of the biomarkers
chosen here or select additional biomarkers that will be
needed for application to the general population. Another
limitation was that this study was not longitudinal. A lon-
gitudinal study would allow identification of more subtle,
individual changes in autoantibody profiles associated
with successive stages of disease progression, and then a
determination of which changes are common among indi-
viduals at the same disease stage. Another weakness is
that the age-matched and gender-matched controls used
here did not have measurements of CSF Ab42 levels.
Finally,
we
did
not
test
the
efficacy
of
the
AD-
associated MCI biomarker panel for use in distinguishing
subjects with AD-associated MCI from patients with MCI
due to other causes (e.g., cerebrovascular disease, drug
side-effects,
depression,
excessive
alcohol
use,
poor
vascular perfusion of the brain, and neurodegeneration un-
related to AD).
In conclusion, we report here a method for early AD
diagnosis at the MCI stage. Early diagnosis of dementia
has many potential benefits for clinicians, patients, and
family members alike. These benefits include, but are
not limited to earlier treatment, which may delay symp-
tom progression, enrollment into clinical trials, which
could potentially facilitate the development of new thera-
pies and drug targets, as well as the ability to make life-
style arrangements and manage future medical care. In
addition to MCI, this simple blood-based diagnostic

s & Dementia: Diagnosis, Assessment & Disease Monitoring 3 (2016) 51-62

 method has also been verified in the detection and staging
of early-stage PD, suggesting the potential for widespread
application of this platform as a multi-disease diagnostic
tool.

literature through PubMed, as well as both meeting
and conference abstracts and presentations. Publica-
tions describing efforts to establish diagnostic bio-
markers for AD have been appropriately cited in
the text.
2. Interpretation: Our findings lead to the creation of a
simple, inexpensive, and noninvasive blood test
with the potential to diagnose and stage AD with
high overall accuracy, sensitivity, and specificity.
To the best of our knowledge, this is the first diag-
nostic blood test using autoantibody biomarkers
capable of detecting early stages of AD.
3. Future directions: This article proposes a “proof of
concept” study describing the potential utility of a
diagnostic panel of autoantibody biomarkers for the
detection and staging of AD. Additional studies us-
ing larger, clinically characterized sample cohorts
with longitudinal data are needed to further evaluate
the utility, and/or modify the chosen biomarker panel
for optimal application to the general population.
