The United States faces dramatically increasing rates of opioid overdose deaths, as well 
as persistent ongoing problems of undiagnosed HIV and HCV infection. These problems 
commonly occur together in substance using populations that have limited, if any, access 
to primary care and other routine health services. To collectively address all three issues, 
we developed the Mobile Intervention Kit (MIK), a tablet computer-based intervention 
designed to provide overdose prevention and response training and to facilitate HIV/
HCV testing in community settings. Intervention content was produced in collaboration 
with experienced street outreach workers who appear onscreen in a series of educa-
tional videos. A preliminary pilot test of the MIK in a Bronx, NY street outreach syringe 
exchange program found the MIK is feasible and highly acceptable to a population of 
people who inject drugs. Participants accepted HIV and HCV testing post-intervention, 
as well as naloxone training to reverse overdose events. Pre-post tests also showed 
significant increases in knowledge of overdose prevention, HIV testing procedures, and 
asymptomatic HCV infection. Future iterations of the MIK can be optimized for use in 
community as well as clinical settings nationwide, and perhaps globally, with a focus on 
underserved urban populations.

Drug overdose deaths in the United States nearly tripled between 1999 and 2014 (1). During 2015 
more than 50,000 people died from overdose nationwide, and almost two-thirds (63.1%) involved 
opioids (1). Research with opioid-using populations has established that social and structural fac-
tors, including poverty, homelessness, or periods of abstinence from opioids due to incarceration, 
hospitalization, or inpatient drug treatment, can increase vulnerability for overdose (2–7). Moreover, 
interpersonal relationships and events, social supports, and life turning points (8–10) can influ-
ence substance use practices and behaviors in ways that can contribute to an overdose event (11). 
Additionally, the increased presence of fentanyl (12, 13) possible in any given sample of heroin 
(14, 15) has contributed greatly to overdose risk.
Many people who inject drugs (PWID) may lack basic information about overdose prevention and 
response, and these knowledge deficits may contribute to overdose risk. For example, PWID may not

understand that a person’s overdose risk can increase under certain 
circumstances due to predictable changes in tolerance (i.e., people 
are more likely to overdose shortly after being released from jail), 
or that Good Samaritan laws protect people who call 911 to report 
an overdose. Some people may also not know that substances they 
are using (e.g., Percocet) are opioids that contribute to overdose 
risk, especially if used with alcohol (16).
Facing reduced access to prescription opioids (POs) from 
medical sources, some users have turned to diverted POs. Some 
PO users have also transitioned to heroin use/injection, because 
compared to POs, heroin may be easier to obtain and less expen-
sive (17–20). The use of heroin, especially when injected, can 
present additional health consequences, including overdose and 
HIV/HCV transmission.
In addition to overdose risks described above, PWID who take 
steps to prevent HIV infection (e.g., not sharing syringes; going to 
a syringe exchange to obtain new ones) may remain unaware that 
HCV can be spread by sharing other injection equipment (i.e., 
cookers, water, or cottons) or that people often live with HCV for 
years without showing symptoms. Moreover, PWID at risk for 
HIV may not know that HIV tests can be performed in as little as 
20 min without drawing blood. In addition, even when people do 
understand their risk, many decline HIV and HCV testing when 
offered, for a range of reasons, including fear of stigma and/or 
mistreatment (21).
Community-based syringe exchange programs (SEPs) often 
provide overdose prevention/response training along with HIV/
HCV education and testing in street outreach settings. SEPs are 
generally located in areas with high levels of injection drug use, 
and offer PWID opportunities to safely dispose of used syringes 
and obtain new ones free of charge. Many SEPs are staffed by 
former opioid users and also provide a range of basic health 
services (including HIV/HCV testing and overdose prevention) 
to people who otherwise may not receive care. However, even the 
most skilled outreach workers can only interact with a limited 
number of people per day, and can only be in so many places 
at once. As a result, even when well-trained outreach teams are 
present, PWID who come to an SEP to receive new syringes may 
not make use of other available services from which they could 
clearly benefit.
Technology-Based interventions
Our team has previously used technology-based interven-
tions to facilitate HIV testing and related education among 
emergency department (ED) patients in high volume settings 
(22–25). EDs and community-based SEPs face a number of 
similar barriers to patient education and HIV testing, includ-
ing limitations on staff availability in high volume settings and 
the challenge of working with high-risk populations who lack 
access to primary care. To address these issues in an ED set-
ting, we created brief (<10 min) interventions that integrated 
pre-post knowledge testing with short educational videos on 
the importance and ease of testing for HIV. At the end of the 
interventions, computers asked each participant if they would 
like an HIV test. The first intervention targeted all ED patients 
(22), subsequent interventions were optimized for participants 
who initially declined testing (23, Aronson et al., submitted1), 
and for youth who declined testing at triage (24). In each of 
the above studies, we were able to increase HIV test rates by 
roughly 30% (22–24, see text footnote 1).
Employing pre-post knowledge testing designs helped us gain 
a better understanding of what participants knew and did not 
know at baseline (25), and how learning specific details from 
a video could potentially influence decisions to test (23). In a 
2012 study, we recruited 160 ED patients who had all declined 
HIV testing at triage, and approximately one-third accepted 
testing after watching a video (23). Qualitative interviews with a 
sub-sample of patients who completed the intervention indicate 
participants tested after learning HIV tests could be administered 
without drawing blood and results could be available in 20 min 
(23). Interviews also indicated that participants were more com-
fortable accepting an HIV test offered by computer compared 
to an HIV test offered by a person, because they did not expect 
a computer to make judgments about them but thought that a 
person would (23).
While discussing future directions for our research, we hypoth-
esized that a similar approach could be used to address issues of 
overdose prevention and response, as well as undiagnosed HIV 
and HCV, in community settings. We then developed the Mobile 
Intervention Kit (MIK), a tablet-based intervention with three 
separate modules (HIV, HCV, overdose prevention) that can be 
shown to participants individually or in any combination, to tailor 
content based on the needs of specific patients or the capacity of 
a facility. Our team had demonstrated in previous projects that 
brief interventions were both feasible and acceptable to patients 
in high volume clinical settings. We, therefore, hypothesized that 
a similar intervention could be successfully designed for PWID 
in community settings.
All three MIK modules follow the same format. Participants 
complete an automated knowledge pretest, watch a short edu-
cational video (<2 min) on the tablet, and then complete an 
automated knowledge posttest. Video content was developed in a 
collaborative process with SEP community health outreach work-
ers and was guided by the Information, Motivation, Behavioral 
skills model (IMB).
IMB, which is frequently used in HIV prevention contexts 
(26, 27), posits that information alone will not precipitate 
behavior change, instead intervention content must also moti-
vate recipients to achieve specific behavioral outcomes. IMB also 
recommends tailoring content to specific populations and risk 
behaviors (28). Accordingly, our team worked with SEP staff to 
develop short video messages that would not only educate PWID 
about HIV/HCV testing and overdose prevention/response but 
would also motivate participants to accept testing or training 
offered at the end of the intervention.
As soon as the videos end, the MIK presents a posttest to each 
participant. The HIV knowledge test was based on knowledge 
tests previously used by our team. The HCV knowledge test was 
based on the brief hepatitis C knowledge scale by Balfour et al.

(29), and the overdose prevention and response knowledge test 
was based on recommended training guidelines and protocols 
developed by the New York Department of Health and Mental 
Hygiene.
After completing the knowledge posttests, the MIK offers 
each participant an HIV or HCV test, depending on the module 
they were enrolled in, or asks participants if they would like to 
receive training in how to administer naloxone and then receive 
a naloxone kit to take home.
Once participants respond to the offer of an HIV/HCV test or 
naloxone, the MIK presents a set of acceptance items, which are 
described further in the Section “Materials and Methods.”
research Questions
Two obvious sets of questions emerged during the MIK’s design 
and development. First, would SEP participants agree to partici-
pate in a preliminary pilot study, and if so, would they complete 
the intervention? Unlike an ED setting, where the mean wait 
time to see a physician is 1 h (more in urban and high volume 
environments) (30) and patients have a fair amount of downtime 
to participate in research, people generally come to an SEP for 
much shorter amounts of time. Second, would people at an SEP 
think the intervention was worth their time and attention? This 
question takes on particular importance because street out-
reach sites can present especially challenging environments for 
intervention delivery. Not only would the MIK need to be brief 
enough to complete during a short SEP visit, it would have to 
be self-contained and flexible enough to complete in an outdoor 
setting, private enough that participants would feel comfortable, 
and perhaps most challenging of all, interesting enough to war-
rant participants’ attention despite all the potential distractions 
around them.
To examine these questions, we designed an early stage pilot 
study to examine the MIK’s feasibility and acceptability at a work-
ing SEP site. In addition, we also included secondary measures 
to examine pre-post knowledge change, and programmed the 
tablets to offer HIV/HCV testing or naloxone training to each 
participant.
Thus, the goal of the current study was to examine the follow-
ing primary research questions:
 
1. Would the MIK be feasible in a street outreach setting, and 
would participants find the intervention acceptable? Would 
PWID at a working SEP agree to participate, and if so, would 
they complete the intervention? If participants did complete 
the intervention, would the total time spent on the intervention 
be short enough to deliver without disrupting SEP workflows? 
Last, would participants who completed the intervention 
describe it as worthwhile?
In addition we sought to examine:
 
2. Participant knowledge. What did participants know at base-
line, and did participant knowledge increase after watching a 
short video?
 
3. Preliminary efficacy. Did participants accept HIV/HCV test-
ing or naloxone training offered by the tablets at the end of the 
intervention?
MaTerials anD MeThODs
In December 2016 outreach staff recruited participants at a 
Bronx, New York street outreach SEP run by New York Harm 
Reduction Educators.
sample
Outreach staff recruited a convenience sample of 31 SEP clients. 
The sample was 52% male, with a mean age of 47.84 years, 
SD = 12.12. Sixty-five percent of participants identified as White, 
including 55% White Latino (n = 17), and 10% White non-Latino 
(n = 3). Twenty-nine percent identified as Black or African-
American, including 6% Black Latino (n = 2), and 23% Black 
non-Latino (n = 7). One participant identified as non-Latino 
American Indian/Alaska Native, and one participant identified 
as Latino Hawaiian or Other Pacific Islander.
recruitment
Participants were eligible to participate in the study if they were 
clients of the SEP aged 18 and older. Exclusion criteria were posi-
tive HIV or HCV status, as well as HIV or HCV testing within 
the past 2 months.
Participants were recruited during service provision hours. 
Data collection shifts were scheduled to coincide with service 
provision. SEP clients generally gathered at the site shortly before 
SEP staff began offering services each day. At the start of each data 
collection shift SEP staff explained our research to clients who 
were waiting for services and asked if any would be interested in 
participating. Staff then made a list of eligible clients who were 
willing to participate.
All participants provided written informed consent. Consent 
forms, study instruments, and procedures were approved by our 
research team’s Institutional Review Board. Participants were not 
offered incentives to test for HIV/HCV or to receive naloxone 
training. As compensation for their time, participants who com-
pleted the intervention received an $11 Metrocard, which would 
cover the cost of four trips on New York City public transit.
study Procedures and Materials
All data collection instruments were administered via tablet–
computer. After providing written consent, participants were 
handed tablet computers with a web-based version of the MIK 
pre-installed, and a pair of headphones. The MIK first collected 
basic demographic data, including age, race/ethnicity, and gender. 
The MIK then presented all participants with a behavioral risk 
screening, separately examining substance use and sexual risk.
Once participants had responded to the demographic and risk 
screening items, the MIK presented one module to each partici-
pant addressing overdose prevention, HIV testing and prevention, 
or HCV testing and prevention. The intervention design enables 
program staff to select a single module for each participant, or 
multiple modules in any combination. As described above, the 
MIK administered a knowledge pretest to each participant, and 
then presented a short video followed by a knowledge posttest. 
After the posttests, the MIK asked each participant if they would, 
depending on the module, like an HIV test, an HCV test, or if they

would like more information on naloxone. Last, the MIK pre-
sented an automated set of acceptance items. We have successfully 
used similar sets of acceptance items on previous projects [e.g., 
Ref. (23, 24)]. The items present separate scales measuring how 
interesting, useful, and easy to use participants find the informa-
tion presented via the tablet-based intervention. Additional items 
measure how much new information the participants learn, along 
with how much they like the MIK, how much they understood, 
and how threatening they found it. The MIK presents each of the 
above items as clickable 10-point scales with the lowest possible 
value on the left, and the highest possible value on the right. For 
example, the scale asking participants how interesting they found 
the intervention is labeled “Not Interesting” on the left and “Very 
Interesting” on the right. Together, these scales can provide a 
more thorough understanding of participants’ experience.
When participants had completed the acceptance items, SEP 
staff collected the tablets and headphones. If participants declined 
naloxone training or HIV/HCV testing, their participation in the 
study was complete. Patients who accepted naloxone training met 
with an SEP staffer to learn how to administer naloxone to reverse 
an overdose. Participants who accepted HIV or HCV testing were 
privately tested inside a van at the outreach site and received their 
test results before leaving. All participants who tested HIV or 
HCV positive were referred to care by SEP staff.
resUlTs
Primary Outcomes
Would PWID at a Working SEP Agree to Participate, 
and If So, Would They Complete the Intervention?
Data were collected at the SEP 1 day a week for a total of 3 weeks. 
Our recruitment goal was 10 people per day, and during each 
day of data collection far more than 10 people volunteered to 
take part. As noted above, SEP staff made a list of volunteers 
and then selected the first 10 eligible participants for the HCV 
and overdose prevention modules (if we had more Metrocards 
and more time we likely could have recruited many more). Staff 
recruited 11 participants to complete the HIV module. Of 31 
total participants, all completed the intervention, and all but one 
completed all the post-intervention acceptability measures.
If Participants Did Complete the Intervention, Would 
the Total Time Spent on the Intervention Be Short 
Enough to Deliver without Disrupting SEP 
Workflows?
The mean time to completion, including watching a video and 
responding to all pre- and post-intervention items, was 26 min 
and 43 s (SD = 17 min 57 s). Two participant times were recorded 
as substantially longer than 1 h, possibly because staff did not 
immediately log the participants out of their sessions. If these two 
participant times are not included, the mean time to completion 
drops to 22 min and 57 s (SD = 10 min and 47 s).
Would Participants Find the Intervention 
Acceptable?
As described earlier, participants completed seven clickable scales 
measuring their response to the intervention. Responses were 
analyzed separately for each module. Other than responses to the 
question of how “threatening” participants found the interven-
tion (lower scores meant less threatening) none of the accept-
ability items received a score lower than 6.8 out of 10. Although 
there were no significant differences in acceptability scores by 
content module, considerable difference emerged in responses to 
the question of how threatening participants found the interven-
tion. Participants who completed the HCV module reported the 
intervention was far more threatening compared to participants 
who completed the HIV or overdose prevention modules. Please 
see Table 1 for more details.
secondary Outcomes
What Did Participants Know at Baseline, and Did 
Participant Knowledge Increase after Watching a 
Short Video?
Pretest knowledge scores were generally high across all three 
modules, however, some notable baseline knowledge deficits 
emerged. Only half the participants enrolled in the overdose pre-
vention module correctly answered that using heroin shortly after 
release from prison can increase overdose risk, because a person’s 
tolerance will be lower than it was before they were incarcerated. 
Only 6 out of the 10 participants enrolled in the HCV module 
correctly answered that people can live with hepatitis C for many 
years without knowing that they have been infected with the 
virus, and only 6 out of 10 correctly answered that a person can 
get reinfected with hepatitis C after the virus has been completely 
treated and cleared.
Pre-post knowledge scores increased for 12 out of 14 items. 
Knowledge increased significantly on two items, did not change 
for one, and decreased for another. Please see Table 2 for more 
detail.
Did Participants Accept HIV/HCV Testing or 
Overdose Prevention/Naloxone Training Offered by 
the Tablets at the End of the Intervention?
All ten participants enrolled in the HCV module accepted HCV 
tests offered by the tablets at the end of the video. Two tests were 
reactive. Ten out of 11 participants in the HIV module (91%) 
accepted HIV tests offered by the tablet. One HIV test was 
reactive. Five out of 10 participants in the overdose prevention 
module (50%) agreed to receive additional training in naloxone 
when offered by the tablets. An additional participant told SEP 
staff she wanted to receive naloxone training after completing 
the intervention, bringing the total of participants who received 
naloxone training to 6 out of 10 (60%).
DiscUssiOn
Results from our early stage pilot indicate the MIK is both feasible 
and acceptable in a street outreach setting. The findings that all 
participants completed the intervention, and that the mean time 
to completion was roughly 23 min, are especially encouraging. All 
participants had the ability to end their participation at any time, 
yet none chose to do so. The 23 min completion time suggests the 
MIK can potentially be integrated into a variety of community

settings, just as our prior interventions have been shown feasible 
in high volume clinical environments. Some components of 
the MIK that required longer amounts of time (e.g., the risk 
screening) can potentially be streamlined in future iterations. 
Subsequent versions of the MIK can also enable program staff
 
to select which components of the risk screening (i.e., substance 
use, sexual risk history) are administered or skipped, just as the 
current version enables staff to select which content modules are 
delivered to each participant.
Acceptability scores are also encouraging, as none of the 
items elicited a strong negative response. The difference, by 
module, in response to the question about how threatening 
participants found the intervention (the HCV module was 
described as more threatening compared to the other two) 
appears to warrant further examination. Participants may have 
been unnerved by video content explaining that people can 
live with HCV for years without showing symptoms, and that 
after successful treatment people can become reinfected with 
HCV. As described in the Section “Results,” 60% of participants 
answered these questions incorrectly at pretest. Ultimately, the 
improvements in HCV knowledge among our sample, along 
with the post-intervention uptake of HCV testing (100% of 
participants who completed the HCV module agreed to tests 
offered by the MIK post-intervention) may prove highly valu-
able. As noted in the introduction, PWID who already take steps 
to protect themselves from HIV (i.e., only using new syringes 
and not sharing them) may be unaware that sharing other injec-
tion equipment (e.g., cookers, cotton, or water) may leave them 
vulnerable to HCV.
The finding that half the participants who completed the 
overdose prevention module did not know at pretest that mixing 
heroin with alcohol or sleeping pills (e.g., ambien or benzodiaz-
epines) can increase overdose risk aligns with previous research 
(6, 31, 32) and warrants particular attention. Understanding how 
changes in tolerance can increase risk can help people protect 
themselves, and for that reason, the overdose prevention video 
clearly describes how lowered tolerance after incarceration can 
create dangerous situations for the most knowledgeable and 
experienced PWID.
Although many face-to-face interventions already exist to 
individually address HIV prevention and testing, HCV preven-
tion and testing, and overdose prevention/response, the MIK is 
different for three important reasons: the MIK is a highly repli-
cable tablet-based intervention, it collectively addresses multiple 
persistent issues that threaten the health of PWID worldwide, 
and the MIK is designed to be both customizable and expand-
able. As mentioned in the Section “Introduction,” even the most 
skilled outreach workers can only interact with a limited number 
of clients per day, and can only be in so many places at once. 
Because the MIK is offered as a tablet-based intervention it can 
potentially enable SEPs and other care providers to offer services 
to an increased number of people, more effectively, without hir-
ing additional staff.
Further, our findings from the current study align with previ-
ous research indicating that people are often more comfortable 
addressing sensitive issues via computer instead of face-to-face 
(23). This may prove especially important for interventions

addressing potentially lethal issues such as HIV, HCV, and over-
dose. The fact that the MIK addresses all three may also prove 
especially valuable in settings that serve PWID. Many PWID 
have limited access to health care (33), making each opportunity 
to provide testing and prevention education that much more 
valuable.
Last, the MIK can be customized depending on the needs of a 
specific organization or a particular client. As described above, an 
easy to use menu enables program staff to select content modules 
individually or in any combination. The flexible nature of the MIK 
will also enable us to add new content modules in the future, e.g., 
the benefits of pre-exposure prophylaxis, without the time and 
expense required to create new intervention software for each 
additional health issue. By addressing multiple issues, the MIK 
may offer a highly economical means (both in terms of time and 
cost) to deliver behavioral health interventions to populations that 
might otherwise remain underserved. Thus, the MIK may prove 
especially valuable if delivered on a national or international scale.
The mobile video format also appears particularly well suited 
to the current project. In addition to participants reporting the 
intervention was useful, easy to understand, and contained new 
information, informal discussion with participants indicates 
learning beyond what we expected. The video mentions that 
mixing Percocet with heroin or alcohol can lead to an overdose. 
After watching the video, one participant animatedly told our 
team that he planned to warn his friends to be careful not to 
overdose on Percocet, because he and his friends had been using 
them without understanding how dangerous they could be (he 
said his friends told him not to worry, it’s just Percocet, you can’t 
overdose).
The fact that 6 out of 10 participants agreed to receive addi-
tional naloxone training, and to receive a take-home naloxone 
kit, is also highly encouraging. In the video, an SEP staff member 
walks viewers step-by-step through the assembly and use of an 
intra-nasal naloxone device. This may have made participants 
more amenable to receiving additional training and to taking kits 
with them.
A clear limitation of the current pilot is that participants may 
not have agreed to participate had they not received an incen-
tive. Offering an $11 incentive to each intervention recipient 
as routine practice would greatly limit the sustainability and 
potential scalability of our design. Additional research can 
explore the use of smaller incentives, or possibly even integrat-
ing the MIK into routine practice at an SEP without offering 
any incentives.
As noted in the results section, the fact that far more people 
volunteered to complete an MIK module than we had planned 
for is highly encouraging. This may speak to the success of the 
intervention’s non-judgmental approach, and may also highlight 
the high levels of trust the street outreach workers we partnered 
with have established with the PWID they serve. It also may 
speak to the active role that many PWID take in accessing care 
outside clinical settings and the steps people take to protect 
their health (e.g., going to an outdoor SEP on a cold rainy day 
to get new syringes) (34, 35). Additional research is warranted 
to examine how the MIK can be implemented beyond a small-
scale pilot.
Given the increasing number of opioid overdoses in the 
United States [78 people die every day from overdose (36)] 
and the ongoing widespread problems of undiagnosed HIV

and HCV among substance users, the need for increased 
 
education and testing appear clear, as does the need for an 
intervention to address all three issues. The MIK is designed 
to be completely customizable and can, therefore, be adapted 
to specific populations, environments, and health behaviors. 
Further, different versions of the MIK can potentially be 
 
developed for a range of settings that serve substance users 
including SEPs, opioid treatment programs, and hospital 
 
EDs.
