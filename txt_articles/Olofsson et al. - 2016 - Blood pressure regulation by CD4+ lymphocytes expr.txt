Abstract
Blood pressure regulation is known to be maintained by a neuro-endocrine circuit, but whether 
immune cells contribute to blood pressure homeostasis has not been defined. We previously 
described that CD4+ T lymphocytes that express choline acetyltransferase (ChAT), which 
catalyzes the synthesis of the vasorelaxant acetylcholine, relay neural signals1. Here we show that 
these CD4+ CD44high CD62Llow T helper cells by gene expression are a distinct T cell population 
defined by ChAT (CD4 TChAT). Mice lacking ChAT expression in CD4+ cells have elevated 
arterial blood pressure and echocardiographic assessment consistent with increased vascular 
resistance as compared to littermate controls. Jurkat T cells overexpressing ChAT (JTChAT) 
decreased blood pressure when infused into mice. Co-incubation of JTChAT increased endothelial 
cell levels of phosphorylated eNOS, and of nitrates and nitrites in conditioned media, indicating 
increased release of the potent vasodilator nitric oxide. The isolation and characterization of CD4 
TChAT cells will enable analysis of the role of these cells in hypotension and hypertension, and 
may suggest novel therapeutic strategies by targeting cell-mediated vasorelaxation.
A major physiological mechanism of blood pressure regulation is through modulation of 
blood flow by alterations in vessel diameter. Acetylcholine, a signaling molecule produced 
by neurons and lymphocytes, is a vasorelaxant that decreases blood vessel resistance and 
reduces blood pressure2. Binding to cognate cholinergic receptors on endothelial cells, 
acetylcholine stimulates phosphorylation of endothelial nitric oxide synthase (eNOS), the 
rate limiting enzyme in the biosynthesis of nitric oxide (NO). Endothelium-derived NO 
diffuses into smooth muscle cells in the vascular wall, where it interacts with the heme-
containing protein guanylate cyclase to induce synthesis of cGMP. This secondary 
messenger down-modulates availability of intracellular calcium required for myosin 
phosphorylation, leading to relaxation of vascular smooth muscle cells, and decreased blood 
pressure. Paradoxically, most arteries are innervated by adrenergic nerves and endothelial 
cells do not receive major direct input from acetylcholine-secreting neurons3–5.
While studying the neural regulation of immunity, we previously identified a specific role 
for lymphocyte-derived acetylcholine in relaying neural signals in the inflammatory reflex1. 
A subset of T cells in spleen and other tissues express choline acetyltransferase (ChAT), the 
rate limiting enzyme for the biosynthesis of acetylcholine1,6, 7. Here, we characterize these 
cells further and determine whether ChAT-expressing lymphocytes provide an endogenous 
cellular mechanism for vasorelaxation in the regulation of blood pressure.

 To characterize these ChAT-expressing T cells, we used fluorescence-activated cell sorting 
(FACS) to isolate splenic ChAT-eGFP+ CD4+ CD44high CD62Llow T lymphocytes from 
transgenic mice expressing enhanced green fluorescence protein (eGFP) under the control of 
regulatory elements for expression of ChAT1, 8. These acetylcholine-producing memory T 
cells have been demonstrated to control innate immune responses and constitute <10% of 
the CD4+ CD44high CD62Llow population in spleen1. Comparison to ChAT-eGFP− CD4+ 
CD44high CD62Llow T lymphocytes by microarray analysis using Affymetrix Gene 1.0 ST 
arrays and unsupervised hierarchical clustering of the complete transcriptome showed that 
ChAT-eGFP− and ChAT-eGFP+ cells formed distinct clusters (Figure 1a). Transcript 
expression in ChAT-eGFP+ subsets differed significantly as compared to ChAT-eGFP− 
subsets (Figure 1b). Analysis of the significant differences using the Gene Ontology 
enRIchment anaLysis and visuaLizAtion tool (GOrilla)9 revealed that genes modulating 
immune process regulation and negative regulation of leukocyte activation were highly 
overrepresented (Supplementary Figure 1); and genes modulating G-protein coupled 
signaling were down-regulated (Supplementary Figure 2). Analysis using the Kyoto 
Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG) database via the DAVID Bioinformatics 
tools10–12 showed over-representation of genes implicated in cytokine-cytokine receptor 
interaction (Supplementary Table 1). ChAT-eGFP+ T lymphocytes were next analyzed by 
comparing ChAT expression against 198 different immune cell subsets in the ImmGen 
dataset13 (cell types listed in Supplementary Table 2). The ChAT-eGFP+ T cell subset 
expressed ChAT at significantly higher levels as compared to the other subsets (Figure 1c, 
Supplementary Table 3). Microarray analysis using unsupervised hierarchical clustering 
demonstrated that ChAT-eGFP+ T lymphocytes clustered with CD4+ memory and regulatory 
T lymphocytes (Figure 1c).
ChAT-eGFP+ T cells within the CD4+ CD44high CD62Llow T helper cell population defined 
a unique branch, significantly distinct from other splenic T lymphocyte subsets in 
hierarchical clustering (Figure 1d). Pairwise Euclidean distance plots of complete gene 
expression revealed that ChAT-eGFP+ T lymphocytes are highly segregated (Figure 1e). 
Principal component analysis showed that ChAT-eGFP+ T lymphocytes harbor a T cell gene 
signature (Supplementary figure 3, Supplementary Table 4), but differ significantly as 
compared to other T lymphocyte subsets by the first principal component (Figure 1f). Gene 
ontology classification demonstrated that genes implicated in regulation of leukocyte 
activation, cytokine receptor activity and G-protein coupled receptor activity were highly 
over-represented (Supplementary Figures 4–5). Pairwise comparison against 13 other T 
lymphocyte subsets in the ImmGen database showed that from the cohort of transcription 
factors implicated in T cell differentiation14, 41 transcription factors were highly over- or 
under-represented in the ChAT-eGFP+ T lymphocyte subset (Supplementary Figure 6). We 
refer to these ChAT+ CD4+ T cells as “CD4 TChAT.”
We collected tail vein blood from ChAT-eGFP mice and found that ChAT-eGFP+ 
represented 1.1% of total circulating T lymphocytes (median 95% confidence interval: 
0.5%–2%) (Figure 2a). To study whether this relatively small number of lymphocytes 
modulates blood pressure, we used Cre-lox recombination in mice to selectively ablate 
ChAT in CD4+ cells. Mice expressing Cre recombinase under the control of the endogenous 
CD4 promoter (CD4-Cre) were crossed with ChAT-floxed mice to generate CD4+ ChAT

 deficient offspring (CD4 ChAT−/−). We obtained continuous recordings of carotid blood 
pressure in awake, freely moving CD4 ChAT−/− and littermate CD4 ChAT+/+ mice using 
telemetry. Both strains displayed normal and similar diurnal blood pressure-variation. 
Systolic, diastolic, and mean arterial pressures were significantly higher in CD4 ChAT−/− as 
compared to littermate CD4 ChAT+/+ mice (Figure 2b, Supplementary Figure 7–8). Blood 
pressure recordings as mean arterial tail cuff blood pressure (MAP) in another cohort of 
CD4 ChAT−/− and CD4 ChAT+/+ mice were also significantly higher in CD4 ChAT−/− mice 
as compared to littermate CD4 ChAT+/+ controls (113 ± 3 mmHg, n = 23 vs. 103 ± 4 
mmHg, n = 17, p=0.028) (Supplementary Figure 9). Finally, blood pressure measured 
through an indwelling left carotid artery catheter during anesthesia was also significantly 
higher in CD4 ChAT−/− as compared to littermate CD4 ChAT+/+ mice (Figure 2c). Heart rate 
was unchanged or decreased in CD4 ChAT−/− mice as compared to CD4 ChAT+/+ mice 
(Supplementary Figure 10, 11). Moreover, echocardiographic assessment of cardiovascular 
function in these animals revealed that cardiac output, ejection fraction, stroke volume, and 
fractional shortening of the left ventricle were all significantly decreased in CD4 ChAT−/− as 
compared to the CD4 ChAT+/+ mice (Figure 2d, Supplementary Table 5). Together, these 
data indicate that deletion of CD4 TChAT increases vascular resistance and blood pressure in 
mice.
To study mechanism of lymphocyte-derived acetylcholine in blood pressure regulation, 
Jurkat T lymphocytes were stably transfected with the pCMV6-mChAT vector engineered to 
express ChAT. Transfected T lymphocytes (JTChAT) constitutively produced acetylcholine, 
whereas non-transfected Jurkat T cells (JT) did not produce detectable levels of 
acetylcholine (not shown). It has been previously established that acetylcholine mediates 
vasodilation and hypotension by increasing intracellular Ca2+-levels, and by activating 
Ser1177 phosphorylation of endothelial nitric oxide synthase (eNOS) to catalyze 
biosynthesis of NO from L-arginine15. To investigate whether JTChAT stimulates these 
mechanisms of NO-production here, vascular endothelial cells were pre-loaded with the 
calcium-responsive Fluo-4 dye and co-incubated with JTChAT. We observed that co-
incubation of JTChAT cells with endothelial cells triggered a transient increase in endothelial 
Ca2+-levels as measured by time-lapse fluorescent microscopy, whereas JT failed to increase 
endothelial intracellular Ca2+-levels (Supplementary Figure 12). Co-incubation of primary 
ChAT-eGFP+ lymphocytes derived from ChAT-eGFP reporter mice or JTChAT with 
endothelial cells stimulated Ser1177 phosphorylation; this eNOS phosphorylation was 
attenuated by atropine (Supplementary Figure 13, 14). Addition of JTChAT to endothelial 
cultures also increased production of nitrate and nitrite in the medium, the stable end 
products of enhanced NO production (Supplementary Figure 15) mediated by exposure of 
endothelial cells to JTChAT in vitro.
To determine whether JTChAT mediate vasorelaxation in vivo, we measured blood pressure 
in anesthetized mice following insertion of a catheter (PE10) into the left carotid artery. 
Infusion of JTChAT significantly reduced mean arterial pressure within minutes, transiently 
producing up to a 10% decrease (Figure 3a). In contrast, administration of saline or JT failed 
to significantly decrease mean arterial pressure from baseline (Figure 3b, 3c). 
Administration of the muscarinic receptor blocker atropine, or the NOS inhibitor L-NG-
Nitroarginine methyl ester (L-NAME) attenuated JTChAT-mediated decreases in blood

 pressure (Figure 3b, 3c, Supplementary Figure 16–17). Administration of JTChAT failed to 
significantly reduce mean arterial pressure from baseline in a group of mice with a genetic 
disruption of eNOS16 (Supplementary Figure 18), as expected from the prior experiments 
indicating that JTChAT enhances endothelial NO production. Together, these results indicate 
that lymphocyte-derived acetylcholine can decrease blood pressure through a mechanism of 
endothelium-dependent vasorelaxation.
The identification here of lymphocytes that contribute to blood pressure regulation reveals a 
previously unknown mechanism in cardiovascular homeostasis. The observation that genetic 
ablation of ChAT in CD4+ cells results in increased blood pressure in mice indicates that 
these cells have a homeostatic role in vasorelaxation and regulation of blood pressure. T 
cells have previously been linked to development of chronic vascular inflammation, 
atherosclerosis, and chronic increase in blood pressure17–19. Putative pathogenic 
mechanisms of T cells in hypertension, which are incompletely understood, include pro-
inflammatory cytokine production, T cell infiltration into vascular walls, and structural 
changes and stiffening of arterial walls secondary to inflammation19, 20. It has also been 
argued that specific T cell subtypes may play distinct roles in hypertension. For example 
regulatory T cells may attenuate hypertension by differentially modulating vascular 
inflammation21. Furthermore, it has been suggested that neural signaling originating in the 
brain stem and circumventricular organs may modulate the role of T lymphocytes in the 
development of experimental hypertension, and that T cells may play a role in the cerebral 
regulation of blood pressure22. The present findings offer an additional possibility, that a 
deficiency of CD4 TChAT could contribute to an increase in blood pressure.
We and others have previously implicated acetylcholine-producing CD4 TChAT in neural 
control of inflammation1, 23, 24. Blood-borne CD4 TChAT may deliver acetylcholine to cells 
devoid of direct cholinergic innervation, including vascular endothelial cells, which respond 
with NO-dependent vasodilation. Because of the physical constraints within 20–40 μm sized 
arterioles25, blood-borne CD4 TChAT (which are on the order of ~10 μm in diameter) are 
likely capable of interacting directly with arteriolar endothelial cells, providing a cellular 
mechanism of acetylcholine-mediated arteriolar relaxation. Prior unexplained evidence of 
decreased ChAT expression in lymphocytes of hypertensive rats as compared to 
normotensive rats26 support a role of blood-borne acetylcholine-producing lymphocytes in 
vasorelaxation. Our findings that CD4 ChAT−/− mice have an increase in blood pressure 
render plausible consideration of whether dysregulation of CD4 TChAT and acetylcholine 
contributes to the pathogenesis of essential hypertension, and whether this mechanism may 
underlie hypertension in some cases. This improved understanding of lymphocyte-derived 
acetylcholine to mediate endothelial-dependent arterial relaxation suggests that it may be 
possible to enhance cellular acetylcholine release in the vasculature to therapeutically 
regulate local blood flow and blood pressure, insights that may have implications for 
developing novel therapy for hypertension.
Moreover, CD4 TChAT are regulated by neural signals traveling in the vagus and splenic 
nerves1. Ongoing studies of these mechanisms using implanted electrical nerve 
stimulators28, 29 may offer another strategy to control the activity of blood pressure-
regulating ChAT+ lymphocytes and prevent or reverse hypertension.

 Online Methods
Mice
All animal experiments were performed under protocols approved by the Institutional 
Animal Care and Use Committee of the Feinstein Institute for Medical Research, North 
Shore-LIJ Health System, the Karolinska Institutet or the University Health Network Animal 
Care Committee.
Choline acetyltransferase (ChAT)-GFP (B6.Cg-Tg(RP23-268L19-EGFP)2Mik/J), ChAT-
floxed (B6.129-Chattm1Jrs/J), and mice expressing Cre recombinase under the control of 
the endogenous CD4 promoter (CD4-Cre) were purchased from Jackson Laboratories (Bar 
Harbor, ME, USA). ChAT-floxed and CD4-Cre mice were crossed to generate mice 
genetically devoid of ChAT in the CD4+ population. Animals were housed at 25°C on a 12-
hour light/dark cycle, and acclimatized for at least one week before conducting experiments. 
Water and regular rodent chow were available ad libitum. BALB/c nude (nu/nu) mice 8 to 12 
weeks-old were obtained from Taconic. eNOS deficient mice16 were provided by Drs. Jon 
Lundberg and Eddie Weitzberg, Karolinska Institutet, Stockholm, Sweden. Cells pooled 
from ChAT(BAC)-eGFP male and female mice were used for functional and phenotypic 
characterization. Animals were euthanized using CO2 asphyxiation or cervical dislocation.
Flow cytometry and cell sorting
ChAT-eGFP+ and ChAT-eGFP− cells were isolated from spleens of B6.Cg-
Tg(RP23-268L19-eGFP)2Mik/J reporter mice by negative selection for CD4+ T cells 
followed by cell sorting by flow cytometry of the CD4+ CD44hi CD62Llow population into 
eGFP+ and eGFP− subsets1. For cell sorting experiments, an enriched CD4+ T cell 
suspension was obtained by negative selection (CD4+ T cell isolation kit II, Miltenyi) of 
spleen cells harvested from male ChAT(BAC)-eGFP mice. The resulting enriched CD4+ cell 
suspension with >90% purity was then stained with anti-CD44 PE (eBioscience, 
12-0441-81), anti-CD4 Pacific Orange (Invitrogen, MCD0430), anti-CD62L PE-Cy7 
(eBioscience, 25-0621-82) and anti-CD19 APC (BD Biosciences, BDB550992) antibodies 
and 7-AAD solution. After gating out CD19+ and gating for CD62Llow CD44high cells, a 
ChAT-eGFP− and a ChAT-eGFP+ fraction were collected using a FACSAria cell sorter 
(Becton Dickinson). The resulting fractions were CD4+CD44highCD62LlowChAT-eGFP− 
and CD4+CD44highCD62LlowChAT-eGFP+. 100–150,000 cells were sorted into FCS-
containing cell culture medium. To improve purity, the freshly sorted cells were immediately 
sorted again using the same gating strategy, now directly into Trizol solution (Ambion) 
according to a modified ImmGen protocol (http://www.immgen.org/Protocols) and 
subsequently frozen at −80° C. Subsequent RNA isolation and Affymetrix Mouse ST 1.0 
gene array hybridization experiments were performed by ImmGen13. Gene expression of 
CD4+ ChAT-eGFP+ and CD4+ ChAT-eGFP+ cells were analyzed separately and in the 
context of subsets of the publicly available ImmGen dataset13 using the R programming 
language (see below).

 Cell culture
Stable transfection of Jurkat cells—Jurkat cells (originally obtained from ATCC) were 
a generous gift from Dr. Charles Chu, The Feinstein Institute for Medical Research, 
Manhasset, NY, U.S.A. pCMV6-mChAT (mChAT ORF in a pCMV6-kan/neo plasmid 
(ORIGene, Rockville, MD (MC220061)) was nucleofected into Jurkat cells with a mouse T 
cell kit (Lonza, Allendale, NJ VPA-1006) and a Nucleofector 2b (Lonza). Transformed cells 
were selected over 2 weeks with G418 (400 mg/mL) in RPMI containing 10% FBS. Isolated 
cells were individually selected by pipet and serial dilution for monoclonal populations, then 
grown for an additional month to ensure stable chromosomal integration. Monoclonal lines 
were analyzed for ChAT expression by Western blotting. Jurkat cell lines tested negative for 
Mycoplasma sp., EBV, HAdV, Hantaan, HCMV, Hepatitis A, Hepatitis B, Hepatitis C, HHV 
6, HHV 8, HIV1, HIV2, HSV 1, HSV 2, HTLV 1, HTLV 2, LCMV, Seoul, Sin Nombre, 
VZV.
Co-incubation experiments—Primary ChAT+ lymphocytes or Jurkat T lymphocytes 
(JT) or pCMV6-mChAT-transfected JT (JTChAT) were co-incubated with either human 
endothelial cells derived from pulmonary microcirculation or murine endothelial cells30, 31. 
Human PEC1.6ST cells were seeded in 6-well plates in Endothelial Cell Growth Medium 
MV with supplement mix C-39225 (PromoCell) and experiments were performed at 
confluency. 2 x 106 ChAT+ Jurkat T cells, 2 x 106 Jurkat T cells, 106 primary ChAT+ 
lymphocytes or acetycholine to a concentration of 100 uM in fresh medium was added to the 
endothelial cell culture, and cells incubated for one hour. During co-culture experiments, 
cells were kept in a modular incubator chamber (Billups-Rothenberg, Del Mar, CA, USA) in 
a microenvironment within the chamber of 37 °C, 1% O2, 5% CO2 and 100% humidity32. 
Culture wells were subsequently washed twice with cold PBS and removal of non-adherent 
cells verified by microscopy. Protein was extracted using T-PER solution (Thermo 
Scientific) in the presence of HALT protease and phosphatase inhibitors (Thermo Scientific) 
according to manufacturer instructions, and lysates stored at −80 C until analysis using 
Western blot. Membranes were probed with anti-peNOS (Cell Signaling) and anti-beta actin 
(GeneScript) and developed with standard reagents (Pierce). Images were acquired on a 
GS-800 calibrated densitometer (Bio-Rad) and images analyzed using Image Studio 
software (Licor). Nitrite and nitrate in supernatants was measured using the Nitrate/Nitrite 
Colorimetric Assay Kit (Cayman Chemical, Ann Arbor, MI) according to manufacturer 
instructions.
Murine lung microvascular endothelial cells were isolated and cultured as previously 
described31. In brief, fresh mouse lungs were rinsed, minced aseptically into small pieces 
and digested in collagenase A (1 mg/mL, Worthington, NJ) at 37°C for 60 minutes with 
occasional agitation. The single cell suspension was filtered through sterile 40 μm cell 
strainer, washed in DMEM medium containing 10% fetal calf serum (10% FCS-DMEM), 
and incubated with magnetic beads conjugated with anti-mouse CD31 antibody (Invitrogen, 
Carlsbad, CA) at 4°C for 30 minutes. The bead-bound cells were recovered by placing the 
tube in a magnetic separation rack, washed with 10% FCS-DMEM, collected and cultured in 
DMEM medium containing 10% FCS, 2 mM l- glutamine, 2 mM sodium pyruvate, 20 mM 
Hepes, 1% nonessential amino acids, 100 μg/mL streptomycin, 100 U/mL penicillin, 100

 μg/mL heparin, and 100 μg/mL EC growth supplement. EC phenotype was confirmed by 
positive staining of multiple endothelial-specific markers.
Calcium measurements—Endothelial cells derived from pulmonary microvasculature31 
were seeded onto glass coverslips 16–24 hours prior to use in calcium imaging experiments. 
The coverslips were placed in a stainless steel imaging cell chamber (Attofluor Cell 
Chamber, Life Technologies, Grand Island, New York, USA). Within this chamber, the cells 
were washed with DMEM and loaded with the calcium-sensitive Fluo-4 NW in DMEM with 
probenecid (Fluo-4 NW Calcium Assay Kit, Molecular Probes, Eugene Oregon, USA) for 
45–60 min at 37 °C under 5% CO2. The imaging chamber was placed in a temperature-
controlled Leiden chamber holder mounted on the stage of an Axiovert 200M inverted 
fluorescence microscope (Carl Zeiss Microscopy, Thornwood, New York, USA) equipped 
with a 40X, 0.60 numerical aperture objective. Data were recorded every 10 seconds by 
illuminating the sample with light from a mercury lamp passing through an excitation filter 
(470 nm ± 40) before being directed at the cells via a 495 nm dichroic mirror. A single field 
visualized in each experiment. Emitted light was captured by a cooled CCD camera 
(AxioCam monochromatic, Carl Zeiss Microscopy, Thornwood, New York, USA) following 
passage through a 525 nm ± 50 emission filter. The image acquisition setup was controlled 
by Axiovision 4.7 software (Carl Zeiss Microscopy, Thornwood, New York, USA).
After being placed on the microscope stage, cells were washed once with HEPES-buffered 
and indicator-free DMEM containing acetylcholine esterase inhibitor. Baseline fluorescence 
was recorded for 2 min at which time cells were treated with 0.1 mM acetylcholine or co-
culture with 106/mL of Jurkat T lymphocytes, pCMV6-mChAT vector-transfected Jurkat T 
lymphocytes, primary ChAT+ lymphocytes, or primary ChAT− lymphocytes. Intracellular 
fluorescence was monitored for an additional 5 minutes before concluding the experiment by 
treatment with 10 μM ionomycin (Sigma-Aldrich, St-Louis, MO, USA).
The acquired images were exported to ImageJ software for analysis. The mean fluorescence 
intensity values of 6–31 cells per experiment were extracted for each time point and 
normalized to the average baseline intensity. Individual cell data was then averaged for each 
experiment. To quantify the treatment response, the average fluorescence in the one-minute 
intervals immediately before and after treatment was calculated.
Blood pressure measurement
Arterial catheterization—Adult C57Bl/6 male mice (23–30 g) were anaesthetized using 
isoflurane and maintained on a heating pad at rectal temperature 37.5–38 °C throughout the 
experiment. An incision on the left side of the neck followed by blunt dissection was 
performed to gain access to the carotid artery. The artery was tied off towards the head 
before cannulation. A PE 10 catheter (0.28 mm inner diameter and 0.61 mm outer diameter) 
was inserted in the artery and secured with USP 6.0 silk suture. Arterial blood pressure was 
then monitored via the saline filled catheter with recording system (AD-instruments). Cells 
for infusion were spun down and resuspended in NaCl prior to experiments. The suspensions 
(200 uL) were pre-warmed and administered via a T-branch on the catheter. In all 
experiments, the animals were allowed to stabilize for 5 min after catheter insertion and after

 that an initial record of blood pressure with saline injection was recorded followed by an 
initial 10 s-3 min baseline recording. Animals with hypotension were excluded. The infusion 
was administered subsequently during approximately ten seconds, and blood pressure 
recorded every 10 s for ≥9 min. Blood pressure change over time was assessed by 
calculating the area under the curve for the baseline normalized MAP tracing of cells and 
then calculating the area under the curve (as exemplified by the shaded areas in Figure 4b) 
between the 240th and the 780th second and/or analyzed using 2-way ANOVA followed by 
Bonferroni post-hoc test using GraphPad Prism. The baseline was calculated as the mean 
MAP over 3 minutes before injection. Jurkat T lymphocytes (JT) or ChAThi lymphocytes 
(JTChAT) (50 x 107 cells in 200 uL saline or the number of cells indicated in the figures) 
were administered, with or without pretreatment with atropine (0.05 mg/kg) or L-NAME (10 
mg/kg). The cells were injected 30 and 10 min after Atropine and L-NAME respectively. In 
experiments with eNOS deficient mice, approx. 1 year of age, saline, JT or JTChAT were 
infused sequentially after a ≈10 s base line and blood pressure monitored for approx. 4 
minutes after each infusion. Animals with recordings interrupted before 4 min. were 
excluded. In anesthesized CD4-Cre+/0 x ChATflox/flox mice and their littermate controls, a 
1.2 F pressure catheter (Transonic, US) in the right carotid artery was used for 
measurements and data acquired using Biopack 3.8 software.
Telemetry hemodynamic recording—12 week old mice were anesthetized using 2% 
isoflurane oxygen mixture and placed on a heating pad. A midline incision was made on the 
neck and the right common carotid was isolated. The flexible tip of a hemodynamic 
telemetry unit (Data Sciences International, PA-C10) was introduced into the carotid after 
puncturing the carotid with a 26 gauge needle. The catheter was secured in place using a 6-0 
silk suture. The body of the telemetry unit was placed sub-dermally close to the abdomen. 
After 5 days of recovery, arterial pressures were recorded for 10 seconds every 1 minute 
over a 48 hour period. Data analysis and acquisition was performed using DataQuest A.R.T 
software (Data Sciences International). The investigator was blinded for animal group at 
time of unit implantation and for the analysis.
Echocardiography—Mice were anesthetized using 1.5% isoflurane oxygen mixture. 
Mice were placed on a heating pad and body temperature was maintained between 37.3 to 
37.6 °C for the duration of the measurements. The investigator was fully blinded for animal 
group for examination and analysis. Transthoracic M-mode echocardiographic examination 
was performed from the long axis view of the heart at the level of the postermedial papillary 
muscle using a Vevo 7700 system (VisualSonics) with a 30 MHz ultrasonic linear transducer 
scanning head. The papillary muscles were not included in the measurements. 
Measurements of left ventricle diastolic diameter (LVDd) and left ventricle systolic diameter 
(LVDs) were done under Time Motion-mode (TM-Mode) and were averaged from at least 3 
cardiac cycles. End Systolic volume (ESV) and end diastolic volumes (EDV) were 
calculated using Vevo770 heart analysis package (volume estimate based on Teichholz’s 
formula). SV was calculated as EDV-ESV; cardiac output (CO) as SV x heart rate (HR); 
ejection fraction (EF) as (EDV-ESV)/EDV x 100; and fraction shortening (FS) was 
calculated as (LVDd-LVDs)/LVDd x 100.

 Non-invasive blood pressure measurement—Non-invasive blood pressure 
measurements were conducted in male CD4-Cre+/0 x ChATflox/flox mice and their littermate 
controls at 7 weeks of age using the CODA NIBP tail-cuff device (Kent Scientific Corp., 
Torrington, CT, USA) as per the manufacturer’s instructions. Mice were anesthestized using 
isoflurane (4–5% induction, 1.5% maintenance) and the NIBP and heart rate recorded every 
45 seconds for 10–12 minutes. The serial measurements were then averaged. All 
measurements were conducted during the animals’ light cycle.
Statistical analysis
Gene expression—RNA isolation and Affymetrix Mouse ST 1.0 gene array hybridization 
was performed by ImmGen (http://www.immgen.org/Protocols). Samples with high and 
comparable array expression levels of CD3, CD4, and CD44 were included in the analysis.
Data analysis was performed using the R programming language. The raw datasets from 
ImmGen13 (Release September 2012) were downloaded from NCB’s GEO data repository 
(GSE15907). After removal of control, test and certain variant subsets (Supplementary Table 
2) this dataset comprises 2–7 replicates of 198 different immune cell subsets.
The R/Bioconductor package “oligo” was used for data import and normalization (through 
‘rma’) and the packages “pd.mogene.1.0.st.v1”, “mogene10sttranscriptcluster.db”, and the 
getNetAffx function from the “oligo” package for annotation of transcripts. This annotation 
process created a set of 476 transcripts that were identical to the 9th decimal, which were 
removed. See also Ericson J et al “ImmGen microarray gene expression data: Data 
Generation and Quality Control pipeline”, available at http://www.immgen.org/. We 
furthermore removed transcripts without any annotated gene symbol available, and 
proceeded to analyze the remaining dataset of 24925 unique transcripts IDs.
Expression data from ChAT-eGFP+ and ChAT-eGFP− subsets were merged with the 
ImmGen data using a ratio-based method for batch effect removal33. To accomplish this, 
overlapping groups between batches were used as reference samples. The ImmGen dataset 
contains CD4+ CD44high CD62Llow Memory T cells from the spleen, labeled T.
4Mem44h62l.Sp. According to available data on ChAT-eGFP+ and ChAT-eGFP− T cell 
populations1, >90% of this subset consists of CD4+ CD44high CD62Llow ChAT-eGFP− 
lymphocytes, and we therefore used the T.4Mem44h62l.Sp and CD4+ CD44high CD62Llow 
ChAT-eGFP− T cell subsets to normalize expression data between ImmGen and 
ChAT_eGFP reporter samples. Each batch was first normalized separately using ‘rma’. 
Then, each sample was divided by the mean of the T.4Mem44h62l.Sp or CD4+ CD44high 
CD62Llow ChAT-eGFP− subsets, respectively. Data were subsequently merged into a ratio 
matrix for transcript IDs.
Hierarchical clustering analysis was performed using complete linkage clustering with a 
Euclidean distance measure. Differential analysis in group comparisons was performed 
using the R/Bioconductor package “limma”34. The David Bioinformatics Annotation Tool 
(http://david.abcc.ncifcrf.gov/)10, 11 was utilized for Gene Ontology (GO) and KEGG 
pathway enrichment analysis. The Gene Ontology enRIchment anaLysis and visuaLizAtion 
tool (GOrilla)9, 35 was used for further analysis and visualization of GO terms.

 In the analysis of transcription factor expression across the dataset, the absolute value of the 
log-transformed expression values of each transcription factor in 14 splenic T cell samples 
was calculated. Since expression data are in ratio format this presents a symmetry for high 
and low expression values. The absolute values of the log-transformed expression ratios 
were then ranked for each transcription factor across the 14 samples. For transcription 
factors that were ranked highest in the ChAT_eGFP+ T cell sample, pairwise comparisons 
for differential expression between the ChAT_eGFP+ T cell sample and each of the other 13 
splenic T cell subsets were performed. Transcription factors for which ChAT_eGFP+ 
samples were ranked highest and significantly different in each pairwise comparison were 
plotted in a heat map (FDR-adjusted P<0.05 in any pairwise comparison between 
ChAT_eGFP+ T and the other T cells samples).
Sample size was chosen depending on available data (Immgen) and for experiements 
according to prior experience with similar experiments in the involved research laboratories. 
Differences between experimental groups were analyzed using one-way ANOVA followed 
by Dunnet’s or Bonferoni post-hoc analysis or Student’s t test as indicated. Blood pressure 
data obtained using telemetry was analyzed using repeated measures ANOVA. P < 0.05 was 
considered significant.
