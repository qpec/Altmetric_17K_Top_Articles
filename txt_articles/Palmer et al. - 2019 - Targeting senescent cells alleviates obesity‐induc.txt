Abstract
Adipose tissue inflammation and dysfunction are associated with obesity‐related in‐
sulin resistance and diabetes, but mechanisms underlying this relationship are

PALMER Et AL.
1 | INTRODUCTION
The prevalence of type 2 diabetes has quadrupled since 1980 (World 
Health Organization, 2016). It is associated with multi‐organ com‐
plications, including cardiovascular and renal disease. Obesity and, 
more specifically, dysfunctional adipose tissue are strongly associ‐
ated with whole‐body insulin resistance and type 2 diabetes mellitus 
(Kahn & Flier, 2000; Palmer et al., 2015). Senescent cells accumulate 
in adipose tissue of obese and diabetic humans and mice (Minamino 
et al., 2009; Schafer et al., 2016; Tchkonia et al., 2010), but it is un‐
clear whether they are merely associated with diabetes or if their 
presence is a causal driver.
Cellular senescence is a cell fate that entails proliferative arrest 
and acquisition of a pro‐inflammatory senescence‐associated secre‐
tory phenotype (SASP; Coppe et al., 2008). Although senescent cells 
exist in relatively small numbers in any particular tissue, they have 
been associated with multiple diseases of aging and are emerging as 
useful therapeutic targets for age‐related diseases, including cardio‐
vascular disease, pulmonary fibrosis, neurodegeneration, and osteo‐
porosis (Farr et al., 2017; Musi et al., 2018; Roos et al., 2016; Schafer 
et al., 2017). A number of stimuli, including potentially oncogenic, 
inflammatory, damage‐related, and metabolic stimuli, can trigger a 
senescence response (Munoz‐Espin & Serrano, 2014). Components 
of the SASP secreted by adipose‐derived senescent cells have been 
postulated to confer insulin resistance upon metabolic tissues, in‐
hibit adipogenesis, and attract immune cells that can exacerbate 
insulin resistance (Xu, Palmer et al., 2015). Here, we determined 
whether removing senescent cells in the context of obesity improves 
metabolic phenotypes.
Recently, drugs that preferentially decrease senescent cell bur‐
den, termed senolytics, have been identified (Kirkland, Tchkonia, 
Zhu, Niedernhofer, & Robbins, 2017). We discovered the first seno‐
lytics based on our observation that senescent cells rely on several 
survival pathways, including those regulated by PI3K/AKT‐, p53/
p21/serpine‐, HIF‐1α‐, and BCL‐2/BCL‐XL‐family components, to 
confer resistance to their pro‐apoptotic SASP and intracellular cell 
damage signals (Zhu et al., 2016,2015). Knowing this, we identified 
dasatinib (D) and quercetin (Q) as orally bioactive drugs that tran‐
siently target these survival pathways to induce apoptosis prefer‐
entially in senescent cells (Zhu et al., 2015). Subsequently, we and 
others found that navitoclax, (ABT263, which targets Bcl‐xL, Bcl‐2, 
and Bcl‐w but not Mcl‐1), is also senolytic (Chang et al., 2016; Zhu et 
al., 2016). We showed that D and Q, alone and in combination, cause 
apoptosis in senescent cells without significant effects in quiescent 
or proliferating cells (Xu et al., 2018; Zhu et al., 2015). Senolytics do 
not prevent the generation of senescent cells and they are effective 
when administered intermittently, which could help to mitigate any 
potential negative effects of senescent cell removal, such as delayed 
wound healing (Demaria et al., 2017; Zhu et al., 2015).
We employed the combination of D plus Q (D + Q) in our studies 
for the following reasons. (a) In our hands, no senolytic investigated 
thus far targets all types of senescent cells (Kirkland & Tchkonia, 
2017). For example, unlike navitoclax (ABT263), fisetin, A1331852, 
A1155463 (Zhu et al., 2017,2016,2015), or Q on its own, D selectively 
targets senescent adipose progenitors (Zhu et al., 2015), a key cell type 
for adipose tissue and metabolic function (Tchkonia et al., 2013). (b) On 
the other hand, Q, unlike D, is effective against senescent endothelial 
cells (Zhu et al., 2015), a cell type implicated in vascular complications 
of diabetes (Caballero, 2003). (c) D + Q is effective in alleviating mul‐
tiple age‐ and senescence‐associated disorders, including many that 
are frequent complications or comorbidities of diabetes in preclinical 
animal models; these comorbidities include arteriosclerosis, vascular

unclear. Although senescent cells accumulate in adipose tissue of obese humans and 
rodents, a direct pathogenic role for these cells in the development of diabetes re‐
mains to be demonstrated. Here, we show that reducing senescent cell burden in 
obese mice, either by activating drug‐inducible “suicide” genes driven by the p16Ink4a 
promoter or by treatment with senolytic agents, alleviates metabolic and adipose tis‐
sue dysfunction. These senolytic interventions improved glucose tolerance, enhanced 
insulin sensitivity, lowered circulating inflammatory mediators, and promoted adipo‐
genesis in obese mice. Elimination of senescent cells also prevented the migration of 
transplanted monocytes into intra‐abdominal adipose tissue and reduced the number 
of macrophages in this tissue. In addition, microalbuminuria, renal podocyte function, 
and cardiac diastolic function improved with senolytic therapy. Our results implicate 
cellular senescence as a causal factor in obesity‐related inflammation and metabolic 
derangements and show that emerging senolytic agents hold promise for treating 
obesity‐related metabolic dysfunction and its complications.

hyporeactivity, osteoporosis, hepatic steatosis, physical dysfunction, 
neurodegeneration, and neuropsychiatric dysfunction (Farr et al., 
2017; Kirkland & Tchkonia, 2017; Kirkland et al., 2017; Musi et al., 
2018; Ogrodnik et al., 2017,2019; Roos et al., 2016; Xu et al., 2018). 
(d) Navitoclax and other BCL‐2 family member inhibitors can be toxic, 
for example, causing severe thrombocytopenia, which can occur even 
with intermittent dosing (Wilson et al., 2010). Navitoclax can also 
cause neutropenia, complicating interpretation of whether its effects 
are due to senolytic activity or immune system suppression. For these 
reasons, we elected to focus on D + Q.
Here, we characterize the effects of eliminating senescent cells on 
obesity‐induced derangements in adipose tissue function and glucose 
homeostasis. To do this, we used both transgenic mouse models and 
treatment with the senolytics, D + Q. Our findings support the idea 
that senescent cells could be a novel therapeutic target for treating 
obesity‐induced metabolic dysfunction.

by ganciclovir (GCV) and identification by whole‐body lumines‐
cence (Demaria et al., 2014) and (b) INK‐ATTAC mice, in which 
a truncated p16Ink4a‐promoter sequence drives expression of a 
vFKBP‐caspase‐8‐FLAG fusion protein that can be activated by 
AP20187, a vFKBP dimerizer, to cause senescent cell apoptosis 
(Baker et al., 2011). Cells that highly express p16Ink4a are targeted 
in the INK‐ATTAC and p16‐3MR models. However, not all cells with 
high p16Ink4a expression are senescent, and not every senescent 
cell highly expresses p16Ink4a (Hall et al., 2017; Okuma, Hanyu, 
Watanabe, & Hara, 2017), limiting the sensitivity and specificity for 
senescent cell killing in these mouse models. Therefore, we used an 
additional distinct, potentially translatable approach for eliminat‐
ing senescent cells, that is, senolytic drugs, which target anti‐ap‐
optotic pathways in senescent cells and do not depend on p16Ink4a

expression to reduce senescent cell burden (Kirkland et al., 2017; 
Zhu et al., 2015).
Obesity was induced either by high‐fat diet (diet‐induced obesity, 
DIO, with ad libitum chow‐fed controls) or by genetic means in leptin 
receptor knockout (db/db) mice (Supporting Information Figure S1). 
Senescent cell abundance, as measured by luciferase activity in 
p16‐3MR mice, increased in response to DIO compared to chow‐
fed mice (Figure 1a–c and Supporting Information Figure S2a,b). 
Bioluminescent imaging (BLI) in ex vivo tissues showed that the most 
prominent signal was present in visceral (specifically perigonadal) 
adipose tissue (VAT; Figure 1c and Supporting Information Figure 
S2b). Although senescent cells are known to accumulate in other or‐
gans including the liver after high‐fat feeding (Ogrodnik et al., 2017; 
Yoshimoto et al., 2013), senescent cell abundance detectible in ex‐
cised tissues by BLI was not as pronounced in other adipose tissue 
depots, skeletal muscle, liver, and pancreas (Figure 1c). That said, 
limitations of BLI, including a high threshold to visualize senescent 
cells and limited tissue penetration of the Renilla luciferase signal, 
could have contributed to our inability to detect bioluminescence in 
these other tissues. Therefore, we used additional, more sensitive 
methods including gene expression, senescence‐associated beta‐
galactosidase staining, and mass cytometry to assess senescent cell 
abundance in the studies reported below.
2.2 | Senescent cell clearance improves glucose 
homeostasis and insulin sensitivity
Senescent cell abundance declined after intermittent administra‐
tion of ganciclovir to p16‐3MR DIO mice (Figure 1a,b,d–f,), AP20187 
to DIO INK‐ATTAC mice (Supporting Information Figure S2c,d) and 
INK‐ATTAC; db/db mice (Supporting Information Figure S2e), and 
D + Q to wild‐type DIO mice (Figure 1g–i). CyTOF analyses con‐
ducted after a single course of AP20187 or D + Q in INK‐ATTAC 
mice showed that adipose tissue senescent cells highly express‐
ing p16Ink4a‐promoter‐induced FLAG, CENP‐B, or p21Cip1 were de‐
creased significantly (Figure 1j and Supporting Information Figure 
S2f). In these experiments, adipose progenitor cells, rather than 
endothelial cells, macrophages, or T cells, were the main cell type 
targeted (Supporting Information Figure S2g,h).
Clearing senescent cells improved glucose tolerance (Figure 2a,b 
and Supporting Information Figure S3a,b) and reduced hemoglobin 
A1c (HbA1c), a marker of long‐term glucose control (Figure 2c and 
Supporting Information Figure S3c). These effects were not seen in 
lean, chow‐fed control mice (Supporting Information Figure S3d–g), 
wild‐type (i.e., not p16‐3MR) DIO mice treated with ganciclovir 
(Supporting Information Figure S3h,i), or DIO mice treated with nav‐
itoclax, which does not target senescent adipocyte progenitors (Zhu 
et al., 2016) (Supporting Information Figure S3j). The time course of 
metabolic improvement following initiation of D + Q treatment par‐
alleled that of clearance of high p16Ink4a‐expressing cells by engaging 
death mechanisms due to transgenes (Supporting Information Figure 
S3k,l). Eliminating senescent cells did not affect body weight, activ‐
ity, or food intake, consistent with improved glucose homeostasis 
being due principally to increased insulin sensitivity (Supporting 
Information Figure S3m–r).
After senescent cell reduction, DIO mice became more insulin 
sensitive, as indicated by insulin tolerance testing (ITT; Figure 2d,e 
and Supporting Information Figure S4a) and an increased glu‐
cose infusion rate during hyperinsulinemic clamping (Figure 2g). 
Furthermore, AKT Ser473 phosphorylation increased in response 
to ex vivo insulin stimulation of adipose tissue freshly harvested 
from animals that had undergone senescent cell clearance (Figure 2f 
and Supporting Information Figure S4b). The insulin‐positive pan‐
creatic islet area remained unchanged after depleting senescent 
cells (Supporting Information Figure S4c–e). Plasma insulin con‐
centrations were lower in response to a glucose challenge in both 
p16‐3MR mice treated with ganciclovir and DIO mice treated with 
D + Q (Supporting Information Figure S4f,g). Pancreatic insulin se‐
cretion was unchanged in D + Q‐treated mice during hyperglycemic 
clamping experiments (Figure 2h). Insulin sensitivity was not af‐
fected by genetic interventions that cause elimination of senescent 
cells in age‐matched lean mice (Supporting Information Figure S4h) 
or obese WT mice (Supporting Information Figure S4i), indicating 
that off‐target effects of AP20187 or ganciclovir are unlikely to have 
contributed substantially to the observed metabolic improvements. 
These results indicate that, at least using these methods for senes‐
cent cell ablation in mice with DIO‐induced metabolic dysfunction, 
metabolic benefits were primarily due to improved peripheral insulin 
sensitivity rather than β‐cell compensation. Hepatic glucose produc‐
tion was also found to be unchanged upon D + Q treatment in DIO 
mice under basal, hyperglycemic, and hyperinsulinemic conditions 
(Figure 2i). Our findings do not preclude the possibility that other 
approaches for clearing senescent cells or at different stages during 
development of obesity‐induced metabolic dysfunction might affect 
hepatic glucose production or pancreatic insulin secretion.
2.3 | Adipogenic potential is improved after 
senescent cell reduction
Circulating and adipose tissue inflammatory mediators, some of 
which are components of the SASP (Coppe et al., 2008; Tchkonia 
et al., 2010), increase in obesity and can impede adipogenesis and 
contribute to insulin resistance (Kahn & Flier, 2000; Xu, Tchkonia 
et al., 2015). In p16‐3MR mice but not WT mice treated with gan‐
ciclovir, plasma IFN‐γ and IL‐1β concentrations were decreased 
(Supporting Information Figure S5a,b). Cells expressing high con‐
centrations of TNF‐α isolated from the visceral adipose tissue 
(VAT) stromal vascular fraction declined upon AP20187 treat‐
ment of DIO INK‐ATTAC mice (Supporting Information Figure 
S5c). Plasma adiponectin, which is associated with improved in‐
sulin sensitivity (Kadowaki et al., 2006), also increased after se‐
nescent cell reduction in p16‐3MR mice (Supporting Information 
Figure S5d,e), and adipose tissue IFN‐γ expression was reduced 
(Supporting Information Figure S5f).

highly p16Ink4a‐expressing senescent cell burden, as manifested by

(Supporting Information Figure S5g). Activin A impedes expression 
of the insulin‐sensitizing adipogenic transcription factors PPARγ 
and C/EBPα, thereby contributing to insulin resistance (Hamm, 
Jack, Pilch, & Farmer, 1999; Xu, Palmer et al., 2015; Zaragosi et al., 
2010). Senescent cell ablation abrogated the DIO‐induced increase

in activin A (Figure 3a,b). This was associated with higher expression 
of adipogenic transcription factors and their targets in adipocyte 
progenitors from obese mice (Figure 3c,d) and enhanced adipogenic 
differentiation in culture (Figure 3e). These findings are consistent 
with previous data showing that senescent adipocyte progenitors 
develop a SASP that inhibits adipogenesis (Xu, Palmer et al., 2015). It 
was also previously found that BrdU incorporation increases in adi‐
pose tissue following AP20187 treatment in INK‐ATTAC mice (Baker 
et al., 2011), suggesting that cleared senescent cells can be replaced 
by nonsenescent, proliferation‐competent adipocyte progenitors 
that can then differentiate into insulin‐responsive fat cells.
We found that senescent cell clearance decreases adipocyte 
hypertrophy (Figure 3f and Supporting Information Figure S5h) and 
increases the ratio of subcutaneous to intra‐abdominal adipose tis‐
sue (Figure 3g,h), reflective of better insulin sensitivity (Gustafson, 
Hedjazifar, Gogg, Hammarstedt, & Smith, 2015). These changes in 
adipose tissue distribution were mainly due to expansion of subcu‐
taneous depots (Supporting Information Figure S5i,j). Furthermore, 
DIO INK‐ATTAC mice treated with AP20187 had fewer lipid droplets 
in muscle, measured by oil red O staining (Supporting Information 
Figure S5k), and less severe hepatic steatosis (Ogrodnik et al., 2017). 
Collectively, these findings indicate that decreasing the burden of 
senescent cells may enhance insulin sensitivity in part by improving 
the proliferative and differentiation potential of adipocyte progeni‐
tors, contributing to healthier adipose tissue distribution and limiting 
ectopic lipid deposition (Gustafson et al., 2015).
2.4 | Macrophage abundance is correlated with 
senescent cell burden in adipose tissue
Macrophages, activated CD4+ lymphocytes, and other immune cells 
accumulate in adipose tissue of obese individuals (Olefsky & Glass, 
2010; Tesch, 2007). Like senescent cells, these immune cells release 
inflammatory mediators, including TNF‐α and osteopontin, which 
can contribute to obesity‐related insulin resistance (Tardelli et al., 
2016; Tesch, 2007). Events responsible for obesity‐related immune 
cell infiltration have remained largely elusive. In VAT of DIO mice, 
macrophage abundance correlated with highly p16Ink4a‐expressing 
senescent cells (as measured by p16Ink4a‐promoter‐induced FLAG) in 
vivo (Figure 4a).
Treatment with ganciclovir in DIO p16‐3MR but not DIO 
wild‐type mice reduced plasma concentrations of the macro‐
phage‐attracting chemokines, MCP‐1 and MIP‐1β, as well as macro‐
phage‐colony‐stimulating factor (M‐CSF) (Figure 4b and Supporting 
Information Figure S6a). Expression of the macrophage marker, 
F4/80, significantly declined in adipose tissue after 2–3 months of 
intermittent treatment to remove senescent cells (Figure 4c and 
Supporting Information Figure S6b), and fewer crown‐like struc‐
tures were found in perigonadal adipose tissue (Figure 4d,e). Also, 
factors secreted by adipose tissue activated T cells, including IL‐17 
(Supporting Information Figure S6c,d) and osteopontin (Supporting 
Information Figure S6e–g; Tardelli et al., 2016; Zuniga et al., 2010), 
which is also a component of the adipose progenitor SASP in humans 
(Supporting Information Figure S6h), declined after reducing senes‐
cent cell burden.
Activated macrophage contamination is a potentially significant 
confounder in these studies, since macrophages can express p16Ink4a, 
β‐galactosidase, and SASP‐like factors (Hall et al., 2017). Unlike truly 
senescent cells, macrophages can revert to a nonactivated state, 
potentially even into monocytes that replicate. Therefore, we con‐
ducted CyTOF studies and specifically assayed the macrophage 
markers, F4/80 and Cdllb, and verified that AP20187 and D + Q do 
not specifically and immediately target activated macrophages, as 
this population did not decrease after one round of treatment with 
either agent (Supporting Information Figure S2g,h). In addition, we 
have previously shown that D + Q treatment sufficient to reduce 
senescent preadipocyte abundance does not directly reduce mac‐
rophage abundance in freshly isolated adipose tissue explants from 
obese human subjects (see Supporting Information Figure S9 in Xu 
et al., 2018).
2.5 | Senescent cell clearance decreases 
macrophage homing to adipose tissue
We found that senescent adipocyte progenitors attract mono‐
cytes in culture (Xu, Tchkonia et al., 2015; Supporting Information 
Figure S6i) and that this effect is mitigated by the addition of 
neutralizing antibodies against the SASP components MCP‐1 
and MIP‐1β, but not M‐CSF (Figure 4f). To test whether senes‐
cent cells can directly cause immune cell infiltration and there‐
fore whether targeting senescent cells reduces subsequent 
macrophage burden in adipose tissue, we injected monocytes 
that constitutively express luciferase intravenously into lean and 
obese (db/db) nonluciferase‐expressing INK‐ATTAC or wild‐type 
mice. We used db/db mice in these experiments due to their highly 
inflammatory adipose tissue phenotype. The injected cells homed 
mainly to the VAT of obese mice, where obesity‐induced senes‐
cent cells concentrate, with little to no luminescence detected in

pressing monocytes injected into obese INK‐ATTAC;db/db mice 
4 days after AP20187 treatment, or into wild‐type db/db mice 
4 days after D + Q treatment, exhibited decreased migration into 
VAT compared to vehicle‐treated mice (Supporting Information 
Figure 4g–i). AP20187 had no evident effect on monocyte mi‐
gration in control db/db mice without the INK‐ATTAC transgene 
(Supporting Information Figure S46m,n). Thus, senescent cells can

cause macrophage migration into adipose tissue in obesity, and 
targeting senescent cells prevents and reduces the adipose tissue 
macrophage accumulation that is often associated with obesity.
2.6 | Decreasing senescent cell burden may alleviate 
complications of diabetes
Because our interventions target senescent cells not only in adipose, 
but also in other tissues, their potential effects could exceed those 
limited to alleviating adipose tissue dysfunction. Senolytics may af‐
fect senescence‐related comorbidities associated with obesity (e.g., 
hepatic steatosis, osteoarthritis, and neuropsychiatric dysfunction), 
accelerated aging‐like states associated with obesity (e.g., sarcope‐
nia and frailty), and the consequences of chronological aging itself by 
acting on nonadipose senescent cells (Kirkland et al., 2017; Ogrodnik 
et al., 2019; Palmer et al., 2015). They may also decrease the com‐
plications of diabetes and obesity related to persistent inflammation 
caused by senescent cell accumulation, including cardiovascular 
and renal dysfunction. Indeed, senescent cell clearance enhanced 
diastolic function in obese mice (Figure 5a–c; systolic function as 
measured by left ventricular ejection fraction [EF] was unchanged 
[Figure 5d]), consistent with earlier reports in other models that se‐
nescent cells contribute to cardiac dysfunction, vascular stiffness, 
and atherosclerosis (Childs et al., 2016; Demaria et al., 2017; Roos 
et al., 2016; Zhu et al., 2015). Additionally, renal podocytes had 
increased expression of Wilms tumor protein (Wt‐1), a measure of 
podocyte integrity and function (Figure 5e; Guo et al., 2002), after 
D + Q treatment, which also decreased p16Ink4a+ cells in renal cor‐
tex (Figure 5f). Furthermore, we found decreased urinary albumin 
to creatinine ratio (ACR), an indicator of renal dysfunction, after tar‐
geting senescent cells genetically or with senolytic drugs in obese 
mice (Figure 5g,h). Thus, senolytics may alleviate senescence‐associ‐
ated complications of metabolic dysfunction, beyond the impact of 
glucose‐lowering and insulin sensitization that senolytics share with 
certain currently available diabetes treatments.
3 | DISCUSSION
Our study indicates in several different models that senescent cell 
clearance may be an effective strategy for alleviating important ele‐
ments of obesity‐related metabolic dysfunction. Senolytic treatment 
recapitulated metabolic improvements seen after transgene‐medi‐
ated clearance of senescent cells. Senescent cells may not only drive 
insulin resistance directly through their SASP, but also promote adi‐
pose tissue immune cell infiltration and impair progenitor cell func‐
tion. More investigation is needed into the relative contributions of 
each of these mechanisms to insulin resistance and complications 
of diabetes.
The transgenic models used in these studies are dependent on 
targeting high p16Ink4a expression. Not every senescent cell has high 
p16Ink4a, and there are cell types that have a transient elevation in 
p16Ink4a that are not truly senescent, such as activated macrophages 
(Hall et al., 2017). These points suggest that interpreting studies 
based on targeting cells with high expression of p16Ink4a alone re‐
quires caution, so we also used senolytics to test our hypothesis. 
Effects of D + Q do not depend on high p16Ink4a expression, but 
rather on transiently disabling the survival pathways protecting se‐
nescent cells from apoptosis.
It is possible that other senolytic agents may have distinct or 
complementary effects to those of D + Q in diabetes, since senolyt‐
ics vary considerably in the spectra of senescent cell types that are 
targeted. Thus, targeting different types of senescent cells and de‐
termining the effects of various combinations of different senolyt‐
ics, as well as behavioral interventions (e.g., exercise [Schafer et al., 
2016] or dietary interventions), will be important next steps in har‐
nessing the benefits of these drugs. This might open opportunities 
to create individualized treatments by targeting particular senescent 
cell types in patients with different constellations of symptoms and 
complications of metabolic disease. Another key step will be to test 
effects of different senolytics on metabolic dysfunction and its com‐
plications across a broad range of animal models of diabetes, includ‐
ing type 1 diabetes, and studies in primates in preparation for clinical 
trials.
Importantly, initial human trials of senolytics for other conditions 
are underway. Indeed, the first clinical trial of senolytics was re‐
cently reported. Improvements in physical function of patients with 
idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis were found in a pilot study of D + Q 
(Justice et al., 2019). Similar pilot clinical trials and ultimately larger, 
longer duration, randomized double‐blind placebo‐controlled trials 
are needed to test the potential therapeutic benefits of senolytics in 
diabetic patients, including alleviation of complications of metabolic 
disease such as cardiovascular, renal, and neurological dysfunction. 
Critically, since D + Q was given intermittently and the elimination 
half‐life of each drug is <12 hr (Christopher et al., 2008; Graefe et al., 
2001), the observed effects are consistent with reduced senescent 
cell burden, rather than effects on senescence‐independent sig‐
naling pathways, receptors, or enzymes that require the sustained 
presence of drugs. Thus, intermittent administration of senolytics 
may delay or alleviate diabetes, complications of both obesity and di‐
abetes, and other comorbidities associated with senescence‐related 
chronic diseases, a possibility that, if further confirmed in pre‐clini‐
cal studies, merits examination in clinical trials.
4 | EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURES
4.1 | Animals
Mice heterozygous for either the p16‐3MR or INK‐ATTAC 
transgenes on a C57BL/6 background were used in these experi‐
ments (Demaria et al., 2017; Xu, Palmer et al., 2015). J.L.K., T.T., 
J. van Deursen, and D. Baker (all currently at Mayo) devised the 
strategy and characterized INK‐ATTAC mice (Baker et al., 2011). 
The ATTAC construct was devised by P. Scherer, who sent it to 
J.L.K. p16‐3MR mice were generously provided by Dr. Judith 
Campisi. Leptin receptor knockout heterozygotic (Leprdb/−) mice 
     |  11 of 15
PALMER Et AL.
were purchased from Jackson Laboratory (Bar Harbor, ME) and 
crossed to either p16‐3MR mice or INK‐ATTAC mice to generate 
mice homozygous for the leptin receptor mutation (db/db). CAG‐
luc transgenic C57BL/6 mice were obtained from the Jackson 
Laboratory (Stock No: 025854). The CAG‐luc mouse expresses 
firefly luciferase driven by the constitutively active CAG pro‐
moter in most tissues. Ages of mice used in each experiment are 
reflected in Supporting Information Figure S1. Male and female 
mice were used for db/db experiments. Male mice were used for 
DIO experiments due to their increased susceptibility to high‐fat 
diet‐induced metabolic dysfunction. For diet‐induced obesity 
(DIO) experiments, mice were maintained on a 60% (by calorie) 
fat diet (D12492, irradiated; Research Diets, New Brunswick, NJ). 
Lean control mice were fed a normal chow diet (LabDiet 5053, 
13.2% fat by calorie, St. Louis, MO). Mice were maintained under 
a 12‐hr light and 12‐hr dark cycle at 24°C with free access to food 
and water in a pathogen‐free facility. All studies were approved 
by the Mayo Clinic Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee.
4.2 | Cell strains
THP‐1 cells were purchased from ATCC (Manassas, VA).
Human adipocyte progenitors, also termed adipose‐derived stem 
cells or preadipocytes (Tchkonia et al., 2013), were isolated from ab‐
dominal subcutaneous adipose tissue biopsies from nine healthy sub‐
jects undergoing surgery to donate a kidney (age 37 ± 6 years, male, 
BMI 26 ± 2). These cells were used for osteopontin measurements in 
senescent cells and for THP‐1 migration studies. These studies were 
approved by the Mayo Clinic Institutional Review Board.
4.3 | Drug treatments
Ganciclovir (Genentech, San Francisco, CA; 25 mg/kg), dissolved in 
water and phosphate‐buffered saline [PBS]) or PBS alone, was ad‐
ministered i.p. for five consecutive days, with 10–14 days between 
the last dose of one treatment round and the first day of the next 
treatment round. AP20187 (MedchemExpress, Monmouth Junction, 
NJ; 10mg/kg, dissolved in ethanol for stock solution, then diluted 
in PEG‐400 and 2% Tween for dosing solution) or PEG‐400/Tween 
2% in water (vehicle) was administered by i.p. injection for three 
consecutive days, with 12 days between treatments. Dasatinib (LC 
Laboratories, Woburn, MA; 5 mg/kg) and quercetin (Sigma Aldrich, 
St. Louis, MO; 50 mg/kg) or vehicle (60% Phosal, 10% ethanol, 
and 30% PEG‐400) were administered for five consecutive days 
monthly via oral gavage in cohort 1, or for three consecutive days, 
with 14 days between the last dose of one treatment round and the 
first day of the next treatment round in cohort 2. For CyTOF ex‐
periments, a single course of AP20187 (3 days) or D + Q (5 days) was 
given 3 days prior to sacrifice. Navitoclax (Active Biochem, Kowloon, 
Hong Kong; 50 mg/kg) or vehicle (60% Phosal, 10% ethanol, and 
30% PEG‐400) was administered via oral gavage for five consecutive 
days monthly. Body composition was measured by EchoMRI (Echo 
Medical Systems, Houston, TX).
4.4 | Metabolic testing
For DIO and lean mice, glucose tolerance and insulin tolerance test‐
ing (ipGTT, ITT, respectively) were performed by injecting 1.2 g/kg 
glucose or 0.8 mU/kg insulin (i.p.) in the early afternoon following 
a 6‐hr or 4‐hr fast, respectively. Glucose‐stimulated insulin secre‐
tion (GSIS) in DIO and lean mice was measured after oral gavage of 
1.5 g/kg glucose following a 4‐hr fast. Intraperitoneal injection of 
glucose was used for GTT due to increased excursion of blood glu‐
cose, allowing for better differentiation between treatment groups. 
Oral administration of glucose was used for insulin secretion meas‐
urements in Figure 2h to ensure the most physiologic induction of 
insulin secretion (including the contribution of incretins), as well as to 
test the overall validity of our results by testing improvements with 
senescent cell clearance in multiple assays. For db/db mice, glucose 
tolerance testing was performed by injecting 1.0 g/kg glucose i.p. 
following an overnight fast. Tail vein blood glucose was measured 
at time 0 and at indicated time points using a handheld glucometer 
(Bayer Breeze 2 [Bayer, Whippany, NJ], or for db/db mice, AlphaTrak 
[Zoetis, Parsippany, NJ]). Aside from clear weight differences be‐
tween lean and DIO or db/db mice, the experimenter conducting 
GTT, ITT, and GSIS testing was unaware of the treatment group as‐
signment of each mouse during testing. HbA1c was measured using 
a commercial test (A1cNow+, Bayer, Whippany, NJ). Plasma insulin, 
adiponectin, activin A, and osteopontin were measured using com‐
mercial ELISA kits (insulin and adiponectin: ALPCO, Salem NH; os‐
teopontin and activin A: R&D Systems, Minneapolis MN).
4.5 | Hyperglycemic clamp experiments
Mice were fasted from 9 hr before the experiment until the end of 
the experiment. The study was divided into three periods, (a) a basal 
period in which only glucose tracer was infused, (b) a hyperglyce‐
mic period (HGC) in which, next to the glucose tracer, glucose was 
infused at a variable rate to maintain blood glucose levels at about 
20 mM, and (c) a hyperinsulinemic–euglycemic period (HIEC) during 
which, in addition next to the glucose tracer, insulin was infused at a 
constant rate and glucose was infused at a variable rate to maintain 
blood glucose levels at about 6 mM. During all three periods, blood 
glucose levels and glucose infusion rates were monitored, from 
which kinetic parameters were calculated.
4.6 | Adipocyte progenitor isolation
The stromal vascular fraction of perigonadal adipose tissue was iso‐
lated by collagenase digestion as previously described (Tchkonia et 
al., 2005).
4.7 | Mass cytometry (CyTOF)
We designed a panel of antibodies based on surface markers, tran‐
scription factors, and cytokines (see Supporting Information Table S1). 
Each antibody was tagged with a rare metal isotope and its function 
 12 of 15  |    
PALMER Et AL.
verified by mass cytometry according to the factory manual (Multi 
Metal labeling kits; Fluidigm South San Francisco, CA). A CyTOF‐2 
mass cytometer (Fluidigm) was used for data acquisition. Acquired data 
were normalized based on normalization beads (Ce140, Eu151, Eu153, 
Ho165, and Lu175). Stromal vascular cells were isolated from epididy‐
mal white adipose tissue. Collected cells were incubated with metal‐
conjugated antibodies and for testing intracellular proteins, including 
transcription factors and cytokines. Fixation and permeabilization 
were conducted according to the manufacturer's instructions (Foxp3/ 
Transcription Factor Staining Buffer Set, eBioscience, San Diego, CA). 
CyTOF data were analyzed by Cytobank (Santa Clara, CA). Total pro‐
genitors were defined as CD45−, CD31−, and Sca1+. Macrophages 
were defined as F4/80+ and CD11b+. Endothelial cells were defined 
as CD31+ and CD146+. T lymphocytes were defined as CD4+ or CD8+. 
Upon testing of antibodies to Renilla luciferase, we found that back‐
ground signals were too high in WT mice to be specific enough to use 
in these experiments. Therefore, we pursued CyTOF experiments in 
the INK‐ATTAC model rather than the p16‐3MR model.
4.8 | Plasma cytokine profiling
Plasma cytokines were quantified using multiplex ELISA on a Bio‐
Plex 200 analyzer by Eve Technologies (Calgary, Alberta, Canada).
4.9 | Quantitative real‐time PCR
Quantitative real‐time PCR was performed as described previously 
(Xu, Palmer et al., 2015). Primer catalog numbers are in Supporting 
Information Table S2.
4.10 | Western blotting
Western blotting was performed as described previously (Xu, Palmer 
et al., 2015).
4.11 | Adipose tissue analyses
SA‐β‐gal activity was assayed as reported previously (Xu, Palmer et 
al., 2015). Briefly, a small piece of adipose tissue was collected in PBS, 
lightly fixed with glutaraldehyde and formaldehyde for 15 min, washed 
3X in PBS, and placed in SA‐β‐gal activity solution containing X‐gal at 
pH 6.0 at 37°C for 14–16 hr. Tissues were rinsed in PBS, nuclei were 
stained with DAPI, and adipose tissue was compressed between two 
glass slides for light microscopy. SA‐β‐gal+ cells as a percent of all nuclei 
were quantified in at least 10 images taken at random per tissue using 
NIS‐Elements software (Nikon Instruments, Melville, NY). Neither 
the person who captured images for quantification nor the observer 
counting SA‐β‐gal+ cells in the captured images was aware of the iden‐
tity of the samples. Photographs of SA‐β‐gal+ tissue chunks were taken 
after 5–8 hr of incubation at 37°C. Cell size was quantified using at 
least 10 images taken at random from adipose tissue chunks by light 
microscopy by measuring diameters of all completely visible adipo‐
cytes per field using Nikon NIS‐Elements software.
4.12 | Ex vivo insulin response assay
Adipose tissue was cut into small pieces (<100 mg) and washed with PBS 
3 times. The minced tissue was treated with 5 nM insulin or vehicle (PBS) 
for 5 min at 37°C. p‐AKT (#4060) and total‐AKT (#4691) antibodies for 
Western analyses were purchased from Cell Signaling (Danvers, MA).
4.13 | Albumin–creatinine ratio
Albumin was measured by ELISA (GenWay, San Diego, CA), and 
creatinine was measured by colorimetric assay (MaxDiscovery; 
Bio Scientific, Austin, TX) in urine collected from nonfasted mice. 
Albumin–creatinine ratio (ACR) was calculated by determining mi‐
crogram of albumin per mg of creatinine.
4.14 | Conditioned medium experiments
Stromal vascular collagenase digests were plated, replated within 18 hr, 
and serially sub‐cultured for 4 population doublings using differential 
plating and culture media designed to select against macrophage or 
endothelial cell contamination. Cells were exposed to 10 Gy radia‐
tion or were sham‐irradiated. After 25 days, irradiated cells acquired 
senescent morphology, developed SA‐β‐gal activity, and expressed 
p16INK4A and SASP components. Cells were washed, and serum‐free 
conditioned medium (CM) was collected and passed through a 0.2‐µm 
filter. CM was concentrated using 3K concentrators (Amicon Ultra‐15 
Centrifugal Filter Units, Millipore, Darmstadt, Germany) and analyzed 
by LC/MSMS (Q Exactive™ Hybrid Quadrupole‐Orbitrap™ Mass 
Spectrometer, ThermoFisher, Waltham, MA) for osteopontin.
4.15 | Adipocyte progenitor differentiation
To induce differentiation of mouse cells, 80% confluent adipocyte 
progenitors were exposed to differentiation medium containing 
DMEM/F‐12, 10% FBS, 1μg/ml insulin,  250 nM dexamethasone, 
0.5mM IBMX,  and 2.5μM rosiglitazone for 48 hours at 20% O2. 
Medium was then replaced with DMEM/12 containing only 10% FBS 
and insulin, and kept in culture for an additional 5–8 days.
4.16 | Comprehensive laboratory animal 
monitoring system
Metabolic rate and food intake were measured using a 
Comprehensive Laboratory Animal Monitoring System (CLAMS) as 
previously described (Xu, Tchkonia et al., 2015).
4.17 | THP‐1 macrophage migration
Migration assays were performed using Transwell polycarbon‐
ate membrane inserts with a 5‐μm pore diameter purchased from 
Corning (Corning, NY). THP‐1 cells were stained with CellTracker 
CM‐DiI dye (Thermo Fisher Scientific, Waltham, MA) according 
to the manufacturer's directions and then plated into the inserts. 
     |  13 of 15
PALMER Et AL.
Nonsenescent control or senescent human primary adipocyte pro‐
genitors were seeded into the bottom chambers of the plates. After 
24 hr, DiI‐labeled THP‐1 cells that had migrated into the bottom 
chamber were imaged.
For neutralizing antibody experiments, THP‐1 cells (105) were 
plated into Transwell inserts and allowed to migrate into the bottom 
chamber for 6 hr at 37°C. After 6 hr, the number of cells that had mi‐
grated into the lower chamber was quantified using the CyQUANT Cell 
Proliferation Assay Kit (Life Technologies) according to the manufactur‐
er's instructions. All neutralizing antibodies were purchased from R&D. 
The concentrations for the antibodies in the CM are Goat IGG (1 mg/
ml), M‐CSF (1 mg/ml), MCP1 (0.2 mg/ml), and MIP‐1b (0.2 mg/ml).
4.18 | Monocyte infiltration
Monocytes were isolated from femur and tibial bone marrow of 
CAG‐luc transgenic C57BL/6 mice using a commercial kit (Monocyte 
Isolation kit, MACS Miltenyi Biotec, San Diego, CA). 1 × 106 mono‐
cytes in PBS were injected i.v. via the tail vein in db/db or lean mice. 
Luminescent signal was examined 24 hr after monocyte injection.
4.19 | Luminescence imaging
Both Renilla and firefly luminescence imaging were performed using 
a Xenogen IVIS 200 system (Caliper Life Sciences, Hopkinton, MA). 
To detect p16‐3MR Renilla luciferase‐expressing cells, 200 µl coe‐
lenterazine h (Rediject, PerkinElmer) was injected i.p. into each 
mouse 10 min before imaging was initiated. For firefly luminescence, 
3 mg d‐luciferin (Gold Biotechnology, St. Louis, MO) in 200 µl PBS 
was injected i.p. into each mouse 5 min before imaging was initiated. 
The exposure for luminescence images was 5 min.
4.20 | Echocardiography
High‐resolution ultrasound imaging was used to evaluate cardiac 
function as previously described (Roos et al., 2016).
4.21 | Anti‐Wilms tumor protein 
immunohistochemistry
Formalin‐fixed paraffin‐embedded mouse kidney tissue sections 
were subjected to steam heat‐mediated antigen retrieval for 30 min in 
10 mM sodium citrate buffer, pH 6.0. Samples were then incubated at 
room temperature for 1 hr with primary antibody (Anti‐Wilms Tumor 
Protein; Abcam #ab89901) diluted 1/100, followed by a 30‐min in‐
cubation in a Ready‐to‐Use HRP‐Labelled secondary antibody (Dako 
K4003). Color was developed using Vector NovaRED Peroxidase 
Substrate Kit (SK‐4800) followed by hematoxylin counterstaining.
4.22 | Quantification and statistical analyses
When comparing two groups, unpaired two‐tailed Student's t tests 
were used. p < 0.05 was considered significant. One‐way ANOVA 
with Bonferroni correction was used to estimate statistical signifi‐
cance when more than two groups were being compared. All values 
are expressed as mean ± SEM. Sample sizes were chosen based on 
the means and variation of preliminary data to achieve at least 80% 
power and allowing for 5% type I error.
