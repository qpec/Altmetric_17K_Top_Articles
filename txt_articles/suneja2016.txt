BACKGROUND: Patients with cancer who are infected with the human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) are less likely to receive cancer
treatment compared with HIV-uninfected individuals. However, to the authors’ knowledge, the impact of insurance status and comor-
bidities is unknown. METHODS: Data from the National Cancer Data Base were used to study nonelderly adults diagnosed with sev-
eral common cancers from 2003 to 2011. Cancer treatment was defined as chemotherapy, surgery, radiotherapy, or any combination
during the first course of treatment. Multivariate logistic regression was used to examine associations between HIV status and lack of
cancer treatment, and identify predictors for lack of treatment among HIV-infected patients. RESULTS: A total of 10,265 HIV-infected
and 2,219,232 HIV-uninfected cases were included. In multivariate analysis, HIV-infected patients with cancer were found to be more
likely to lack cancer treatment for cancers of the head and neck (adjusted odds ratio [aOR], 1.48; 95% confidence interval [95% CI],
1.09-2.01), upper gastrointestinal tract (aOR, 2.62; 95% CI, 2.04-3.37), colorectum (aOR, 1.70; 95% CI, 1.17-2.48), lung (aOR, 2.46; 95%
CI, 2.19-2.76), breast (aOR, 2.14; 95% CI, 1.16-3.98), cervix (aOR, 2.81; 95% CI, 1.77-4.45), prostate (aOR, 2.16; 95% CI, 1.69-2.76), Hodgkin
lymphoma (aOR, 1.92; 95% CI, 1.66-2.22), and diffuse large B-cell lymphoma (aOR, 1.82; 95% CI, 1.65-2.00). Predictors of a lack of can-
cer treatment among HIV-infected individuals varied by tumor type (solid tumor vs lymphoma), but black race and a lack of private
insurance were found to be predictors for both groups. CONCLUSIONS: In the United States, HIV-infected patients with cancer
appear to be less likely to receive cancer treatment regardless of insurance and comorbidities. To the authors’ knowledge, the current
study is the largest study of cancer treatment in HIV-infected patients with cancer in the United States and provides evidence of can-
cer treatment disparities even after controlling for differences with regard to insurance status and comorbidities. Further work should
focus on addressing differential cancer treatment. Cancer 2016;000:000-000. V

INTRODUCTION
Cancer is an increasingly common cause of morbidity and mortality among individuals infected with the human immuno-
deficiency virus (HIV). In the United States, cancer incidence rates in this population have changed since the introduction
of highly active antiretroviral therapy (HAART). The number of acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS)-defining
cancers has decreased and the number of non-AIDS defining cancers has increased with the growth and aging of the HIV
population.1,2 Cancer is now the second most common cause of death among HIV-infected individuals.3
HIV-infected patients with cancer have lower overall survival compared with HIV-uninfected individuals.4
Although this may in part be related to deaths from AIDS-related complications, a recent population-based study found
higher cancer-specific mortality among HIV-infected versus HIV-uninfected patients with cancer.5 Lack of appropriate
cancer treatment may contribute to worse cancer-specific mortality. In a prior study of cancer treatment in HIV-infected
patients with lung cancer in Texas, we found that HIV-infected patients were less likely to receive treatment than HIV-
uninfected individuals.6 Furthermore, there was a suggestion that this treatment disparity contributed to the lower survival
observed in the HIV-infected cases. A second, larger, population-based study examining cancer treatment in

 HIV-infected patients with several common cancers in 3
US states again demonstrated significant differences in
cancer treatment rates between HIV-infected and HIV-
uninfected individuals.7
Although to our knowledge these studies were the
first to highlight the widespread disparity in cancer treat-
ment in HIV-infected individuals, an important limita-
tion is that they did not account for differences in medical
comorbidities and insurance status. HIV-infected individ-
uals frequently have other illnesses, and patients with sig-
nificant comorbid disease may not be candidates for
standard cancer therapy.8 Similarly, insurance status also
plays an important role in access to and delivery of cancer
treatment.9 HIV-infected patients in the United States are
more likely to be uninsured or underinsured compared
with the HIV-uninfected population, which could be a
major contributing factor.10,11
In the current study, we used data from the National
Cancer Data Base (NCDB), including information
regarding insurance status and medical comorbidities, to
assess differences in cancer treatment rates between HIV-
infected and HIV-uninfected individuals for 10 common
cancers. Our aim was to determine the impact of insur-
ance status and medical comorbidities on cancer treat-
ment disparities in the US HIV-infected population. To
our knowledge, this is also the largest study to date exam-
ining differences in the receipt of cancer treatment by
HIV status in the United States.
MATERIALS AND METHODS
We identified adults aged �18 years diagnosed with their
first cancer between 2003 and 2011 from the NCDB.
The NCDB is a hospital-based cancer registry that is
sponsored by the American College of Surgeons and the
American Cancer Society, collecting data from >1500
facilities accredited by the American College of Surgeons
Commission on Cancer. It captures approximately 70%
of newly diagnosed cancer cases in the United States. We
included the 10 most common cancers observed among
HIV-infected patients in the NCDB: cancers of the head
and neck (oral cavity, pharynx, and larynx), upper gastro-
intestinal tract (pancreas, stomach, and esophagus), color-
ectum, anus, lung, female breast, cervix, and prostate;
Hodgkin lymphoma; and diffuse large B-cell lymphoma
(DLBCL). We focused on DLBCL instead of all non-
Hodgkin lymphomas because cancer treatment differs by
non-Hodgkin lymphoma subtype and DLBCL is the
most common subtype in HIV-infected individuals. We
chose 2003 as the starting year for the current study
because the NCDB began collecting comorbidity data in
this year using the International Classification of Diseases,
Ninth Revision, Clinical Modification (ICD-9-CM) diag-
nosis codes.
HIV status was ascertained from reported comor-
bidities using the ICD-9-CM diagnosis codes (04200-
04400, 07953, or V08). For patients with lymphoma,
HIV status also was reported through a Collaborative
Staging site-specific factor. Because we focused on insur-
ance status as an important contributor to receipt of can-
cer treatment, we excluded patients aged �65 years,
nearly all of whom would have been Medicare-eligible by
virtue of age, but we included individuals aged <65 years
who had Medicare as a result of medical disability or end-
stage renal disease. We further excluded patients with
missing sex (618 patients) or missing treatment informa-
tion (9,535 patients). A total of 2,229,497 patients with
cancer were included in the analyses.
Cancer sites were determined as per the Surveillance,
Epidemiology, and End Results (SEER) cancer statistics
review using International Classification of Diseases for On-
cology, 3rd Edition (ICD-O-3) site and histology codes.12
Cancer stage was summarized based on American Joint
Committee on Cancer staging.13 Patient characteristics
included age at diagnosis, sex, race/ethnicity, insurance
status, comorbidity score, census region, and year of can-
cer diagnosis. Insurance status was based on the patient’s
primary payer/insurance carrier at the time of the initial
diagnosis and/or treatment. HIV/AIDS is 1 of 15 non-
cancer comorbid conditions in the Charlson-Deyo
comorbidity score,14 and therefore we recalculated the
comorbidity score excluding HIV/AIDS to derive a modi-
fied Charlson-Deyo comorbidity score independent of
HIV infection to reflect non-HIV-related disease burden.
The first course of cancer treatment was ascertained
for DLBCL and Hodgkin lymphoma as chemotherapy,
radiotherapy, or a combination of both. For all other can-
cer sites, cancer treatment was defined as surgery, radio-
therapy, chemotherapy, or any combination of these
therapies. Sensitivity analyses were performed to include
hormone therapy for breast and prostate cancers, immu-
notherapy for lymphomas, and palliative care for all can-
cer types. Given the generally high rates of cancer
treatment overall, we framed our analyses in terms of lack
of cancer treatment.
Statistical Analysis
Pearson chi-square tests were used to compare demo-
graphic and clinical characteristics between HIV-infected
and HIV-uninfected patients. For each cancer site, multi-
variate logistic regression analysis was used to assess the

 relationship between HIV status and lack of cancer treat-
ment, adjusted for demographic and clinical covariates.
Because active surveillance is a treatment option for
patients with low-risk prostate cancer, we performed a sen-
sitivity analysis to examine the association between HIV
and lack of cancer treatment for patients with stage II to IV
prostate cancers only. We performed further analysis to
examine the association between HIV status and lack of
cancer treatment among privately insured patients. Finally,
we performed a sensitivity analysis excluding patients who
refused cancer treatment as reported to the NCDB.
Because demographic and clinical characteristics
between HIV-infected and HIV-uninfected patients are
known to be different, a sensitivity analysis was performed
using propensity score (PS) with a 10:1 matching method.
For each cancer case, we calculated the propensity of being
infected with HIV based on demographic and tumor
characteristics. We divided up the PSs into deciles across
the full range of values and randomly selected 10 HIV-
uninfected patients for each HIV-infected patient from
each decile as the PS-matched subgroup. Covariate bal-
ance was checked before and after PS matching.
Finally, we used multivariate logistic regression to
identify factors predictive of lack of cancer treatment
among HIV-infected patients. These analyses were strati-
fied by tumor type: solid tumors (cancers of the head and
neck, lung, upper gastrointestinal tract, colorectum, anus,
prostate, breast, and cervix) and lymphomas (DLBCL
and Hodgkin lymphoma). We chose to stratify the analy-
sis by cancer type because lymphomas represent a unique
entity in terms of management and prognosis. Because
pairwise tests are influenced by the choice of the reference
groups, we presented the P value of global trend tests for
heterogeneity and trends instead of individual P values.
Statistical analyses were performed using SAS statistical
software (version 9.3; SAS Institute Inc, Cary, NC).
RESULTS
Demographic and clinical characteristics of the patients
with cancer included in the current study are shown in
Table 1. The final cohort consisted of 10,265 HIV-
infected patients and 2,219,232 HIV-uninfected patients.
Several significant differences were noted between the 2
groups. HIV-infected patients were more likely to be
young (median age, 47 years vs 55 years in the HIV-
uninfected group), male (77.0% vs 47.6%), non-
Hispanic black (41.1% vs 13.2%), and Hispanic (14.0%
vs 5.7%). A greater percentage of HIV-infected patients
had Medicaid (32.2% vs 10.1%), Medicare (19.6% vs
8.4%), or no insurance (10.3% vs 5.9%) compared with
HIV-uninfected cases, the majority of whom had private
insurance (72.5%). Although the majority of patients had
a modified Charlson-Deyo comorbidity score of 0, the
HIV-infected group had a higher percentage with a score
>0 compared with the HIV-uninfected patients (23.5%
vs 17.9%).
Among HIV-infected patients, the most common
cancer types were DLBCL (42.1%), Hodgkin lymphoma
(16.8%), and lung cancer (13.8%), versus breast (30.7%),
prostate (20.4%), and lung (15.9%) cancer among HIV-
uninfected patients (Table 1). A higher percentage of
HIV-infected patients had stage IV cancer at the time of
diagnosis (37.2% vs 18.9% in the HIV-uninfected
group), whereas a higher percentage of HIV-uninfected
patients were diagnosed with stage I or II cancers (57.2%
vs 33.2% in the HIV-infected group).
Table 2 compares cancer treatment between HIV-
infected and HIV uninfected cases. Anal cancer was the
only cancer type for which treatment rates did not appear
to differ significantly between HIV-infected and HIV-
uninfected patients. For all other cancers, HIV-infected
individuals were significantly more likely to be untreated
for cancer, with adjusted odds ratios (aORs) ranging from
1.48 (95% confidence interval [CI], 1.09-2.01) for head
and neck cancer to 2.81 (95% CI, 1.77-4.45) for cervical
cancer (Table 2). The results were similar in a sensitivity
analysis including hormone therapy as the first course of
treatment for breast cancer (aOR, 2.04; 95% CI, 1.01-
4.12) and prostate cancer (aOR, 1.88; 95% CI, 1.43-
2.48). In a sensitivity analysis including immune therapy
as the first course of treatment, the results were similar for
Hodgkin lymphoma (aOR, 1.92; 95% CI, 1.66-2.23)
and DLBCL (aOR, 1.84; 95% CI, 1.67-2.02). The aORs
did not change appreciably when palliative care was
included as the first course of treatment for all cancers. In
an analysis limited to patients with stage II to IV prostate
cancers, HIV was associated with a lack of cancer treat-
ment (aOR, 1.91; 95% CI, 1.39-2.63). The results also
did not change appreciably when patients refusing cancer
treatment were excluded from the analyses.
Table 3 compares lack of cancer treatment among
privately insured HIV-infected and HIV-uninfected indi-
viduals. Similar to all HIV-infected patients, HIV-
infected individuals who were privately insured were
found to be significantly more likely to be untreated for
cancers of the upper gastrointestinal tract, colorectum,
lung, breast, prostate, Hodgkin lymphoma, and DLBCL
compared
with
HIV-uninfected
privately
insured
patients. Differences were not found to be significant for
cancers of the head and neck, anus, and cervix.

 To exclude possible confounding from the covariate
differences between HIV-infected and HIV-uninfected
individuals, a PS-matched subgroup of HIV-uninfected
cases was selected to perform sensitivity analyses. After PS
matching, the distribution of the covariates was more bal-
anced (see online Supporting Information Table 1 and

b There are 15 non-cancer diseases, each with an associated weight, included in calculating the Charlson-Deyo comorbidity index: myocardial infarction
(weight, 1), congestive heart failure (weight, 1), peripheral vascular disease (weight, 1), cerebrovascular disease (weight, 1), dementia (weight, 1), chronic pul-
monary disease (weight, 1), peptic ulcer (weight, 1), mild liver disease (weight, 1), diabetes (weight, 1), diabetes with complications (weight, 2), hemiplegia or
paraplegia (weight, 2), renal disease (weight, 2), moderate or severe liver disease (weight, 3), and human immunodeficiency virus (HIV)/acquired immunodefi-
ciency syndrome (AIDS) (weight, 6). The Charlson-Deyo comorbidity index is then calculated by the weighed sum of the diseases indicated by International
Classification of Diseases, Ninth Revision (ICD-9) codes. In the current study, because the entire study cohort was comprised of patients with cancer with or
without HIV/AIDS, the comorbidity index was recalculated excluding “HIV/AIDS.”

 online Supporting Information Fig. 1). Similar to the
findings among the unmatched subjects, HIV-infected
cases in the PS-matched subcohort were still significantly
more likely to be untreated at all cancer sites, with the
exception of anal cancer (see online Supporting Informa-
tion Table 2). Among privately insured PS-matched
patients, the results were similar to the unmatched analysis
(see online Supporting Information Table 3).
Table 4 shows predictors of a lack of cancer treat-
ment among HIV-infected individuals by tumor type
(solid tumor vs lymphoma). Patients of black race and
with Medicaid, Medicare, or no insurance were more
likely to be untreated for cancer, regardless of tumor type.
Other predictive factors varied between solid tumors and
lymphomas. Advanced stage at the time of cancer diagno-
sis (stage IV) was found to be associated with a lack of can-
cer treatment for solid tumors (aOR, 2.60 [95% CI, 1.93-
3.51] compared with stage I), but associated with the
receipt of treatment for lymphomas (aOR, 0.70; 95% CI,
0.58-0.85). Higher modified Charlson-Deyo comorbid-
ity scores of 1 or 2 were found to be predictors of a lack of
cancer treatment among HIV-infected patients with lym-
phoma, but were not predictors in patients with solid
tumors. Older age was associated with a lack of treatment
for both lymphomas and solid tumors, although this was
statistically significant only for lymphomas.

 DISCUSSION
Two prior studies have demonstrated differences in the
receipt of cancer treatment between HIV-infected and
HIV-uninfected
individuals,6,7
but
they
did
not
account for comorbidities and insurance status, both of
which are known to affect receipt of cancer treatment.
Taking these 2 factors into consideration, we found
that HIV-infected patients with cancer were still less
likely to receive cancer treatment for nearly all common
cancer types compared with HIV-uninfected individu-
als. These disparities persisted among privately insured
patients. Among HIV-infected individuals, black race
and Medicaid, Medicare, and no insurance were associ-
ated with a lack of treatment for both solid tumors and
lymphomas.
Although survival from HIV has improved greatly in
the antiretroviral era,15 HIV-infected individuals may be
at an increased risk of developing comorbid conditions
due to viral co-infections, diseases of aging such as cardio-
vascular disease, and toxicity from antiretroviral medica-
tions.16 In addition, HIV-infected individuals are more
likely to engage in adverse health behaviors such as smok-
ing and intravenous drug use.17 A higher number and se-
verity of comorbidities influence candidacy for cancer
treatments.8 In the current study, we observed that HIV-
infected individuals had a significantly higher modified
Charlson-Deyo comorbidity score compared with HIV-
uninfected individuals (Table 1). However, the difference
in comorbidity did not account for the lack of cancer
treatment in HIV-infected individuals because the associ-
ations were observed even after controlling for modified
Charlson-Deyo comorbidity scores (Table 2).
Similarly,
insurance
status
is
an
important
predictor of the receipt of cancer treatment in the general
population. A recent study of nonelderly adults in the
SEER database found that patients with Medicaid or no
insurance were significantly more likely to present with
advanced stage cancer, less likely to receive cancer treat-
ment, and had worse survival.9 HIV-infected patients in
the United States are frequently uninsured or underin-
sured.10,11 In the current study cohort, we noted that a
much higher percentage of nonelderly HIV-infected indi-
viduals with cancer had Medicaid (32.2% vs 10.1% for
HIV-uninfected individuals), Medicare (19.6% vs 8.4%),
or no insurance (10.3% vs 5.9%). Only 35.5% of the
HIV-infected individuals had private insurance compared
with 72.5% of HIV-uninfected individuals. Improved
access to cancer treatment is urgently needed, not only for
uninsured patients but also for those with Medicaid and
Medicare. However, these differences in insurance status
did not fully account for the observed cancer treatment
disparity because we demonstrated associations between
HIV and a lack of cancer treatment even when insurance
status was included as a covariate (Table 2). Furthermore,
in the analyses restricted to privately insured patients, the
associations between HIV infection and lack of cancer
treatment remained apparent for most cancers. These
findings together suggest that comorbidities and insur-
ance status alone do not explain the treatment disparity
observed in prior studies.
There are other factors that may contribute to the
observed disparities in the receipt of cancer treatment by
HIV status. HIV-infected patients with cancer have his-
torically been excluded from cancer clinical trials, thereby

 limiting the applicability of clinical trial results for this
population.18 Furthermore, cancer treatment guidelines
specific to HIV-infected patients are not available for
most cancer types, which may contribute to treatment dis-
parities. The management of anal cancer in HIV-infected
patients is well studied and documented in clinical guide-
lines,19 and it is notable that this was the only cancer for
which differences in cancer treatment by HIV status were
not observed herein. Lack of experience treating HIV-
infected patients with cancer also may play a role. In a sur-
vey study of US medical and radiation oncologists, physi-
cians were less likely to offer cancer treatment to HIV-
infected individuals if they had concerns about the effi-
cacy or toxicity of treatment, and were more likely to offer
treatment if they were comfortable discussing side effects
and prognosis.20 The majority of respondents believed
that currently existing cancer management guidelines
were insufficient for the management of HIV-infected
patients, and a very small number discussed cancer man-
agement with their patients’ HIV specialists. Further-
more, HIV-infected patients may avoid or not adhere to
cancer treatment due to the psychosocial and economic
challenges associated with the dual management of cancer
and HIV.21 Substance abuse may complicate cancer treat-
ment adherence,22,23 although rates of smoking, drinking,
and intravenous drug use were not ascertained in the cur-
rent study.
Among HIV-infected individuals, black race was
associated with a lack of cancer treatment, a finding previ-
ously described in the general cancer population.24
Advanced cancer stage was associated with a lack of cancer
treatment for solid tumors but not lymphomas. This may
reflect differences in overall prognosis and cancer-specific
survival between patients with advanced stage solid
tumors and advanced lymphomas.13 For lymphomas,
advancing age was found to be significantly associated
with a lack of cancer treatment, a finding that is consistent
with prior studies in the general cancer population.25,26
Modified Charlson-Deyo comorbidity scores of 1 and 2
also were found to be significantly associated with a lack
of cancer treatment for lymphomas, which may reflect
concerns regarding the systemic effects of chemotherapy,
the mainstay of treatment for lymphomas, even for early-
stage disease. In contrast, early-stage solid tumors are of-
ten treated with surgery and/or radiotherapy, both of
which are local therapies that may be more readily
delivered to patients with comorbidities; however, we did
not aim to capture differences in treatment type in the
current study.
The strengths of the current study include the large
number of HIV-infected patients with cancer in the
NCDB, covering 70% of the total incidence cancer
cases in the United States. In addition, we focused on
nonelderly patients in the modern era of HIV treatment,
and the demographic characteristics of the patients with
cancer in the current study largely mirror the US HIV
population.27 Although we made multiple comparisons,
many of the associations demonstrated herein were highly
significant, making chance an unlikely explanation.
There are several important limitations, as well. First,
we did not have data regarding HIV severity, CD4 count,
or receipt of HAART, which may influence candidacy for
cancer treatment. Second, the Charlson-Deyo comorbidity
score (excluding HIV) was calculated based on a maximum
of 10 reported comorbidities; therefore, underascertain-
ment of comorbidities is possible and may disproportion-
ately affect the HIV-infected group. In addition, the
severity of these comorbidities is not reported to the
NCDB and also may differ by HIV status. We also note
that the total number of cases was small for some cancers in
the analyses of privately insured patients. Finally, it is likely
that there was some underascertainment of outpatient can-
cer treatment data within the NCDB, and therefore we
may have overestimated the percentage of patients who
lacked cancer treatment; however, we would not expect
major differences in ascertainment by HIV status.
The results of the current study indicate that HIV-
infected adults diagnosed with any of 9 common cancers
were less likely to receive cancer treatment than their
HIV-uninfected counterparts, even after controlling for
comorbidities and insurance status. These results were
obtained for HIV-infected patients in the modern era of
HIV treatment, and the disparity was observed among
patients with private insurance. These findings suggest
that cancer care providers and policy makers need to
devote special attention to the HIV-infected patient pop-
ulation to understand and address the factors driving dif-
ferential cancer treatment, which may include lack of
management guidelines and clinical trial data. Cancer
treatment not only extends survival from cancer, but also
can improve quality of life, even for patients with
advanced stage disease.19 The observed disparity is of par-
ticular importance given the extended survival of HIV-
infected patients treated with antiretroviral therapy and
the rising number of cancer cases.
