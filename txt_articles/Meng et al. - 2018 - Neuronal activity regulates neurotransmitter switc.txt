Neurotransmitter switching in the adult mammalian brain occurs
following photoperiod-induced stress, but the mechanism of regula-
tion is unknown. Here, we demonstrate that elevated activity of
dopaminergic neurons in the paraventricular nucleus of the hypo-
thalamus (PaVN) in the adult rat is required for the loss of dopamine
expression after long-day photoperiod exposure. The transmitter
switch occurs exclusively in PaVN dopaminergic neurons that coex-
press vesicular glutamate transporter 2 (VGLUT2), is accompanied by
a loss of dopamine type 2 receptors (D2Rs) on corticotrophin-releasing
factor (CRF) neurons, and can lead to increased release of CRF.
Suppressing activity of all PaVN glutamatergic neurons decreases
the number of inhibitory PaVN dopaminergic neurons, indicating
homeostatic regulation of transmitter expression in the PaVN.

A
ctivity-dependent neuroplasticity is involved in stress-related
disorders in the mature nervous system (1). Activation of
the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) axis by corticotrophin-
releasing factor (CRF) is a common stress response pathway.
The paraventricular nucleus of the hypothalamus (PaVN) in-
tegrates stress-relevant signals and regulates CRF release through
several classic neuroplasticity-related mechanisms. These include
changing the amount of glutamate released on CRF neurons after
a single action potential and regulating the number of glutamatergic
synapses on CRF neurons (2). Additionally, neurotransmitter
switching in the PaVN regulates the light-induced stress response
(3). Exposing adult rats to a long-day photoperiod [19 h con-
tinuous light and 5 h continuous dark per day (19L:5D)] decreases
the number of dopaminergic neurons and increases the number of
somatostatin neurons in the PaVN compared with the numbers
following exposure to a balanced-day photoperiod (12L:12D).
This transmitter switch leads to an elevated CRF level in the
plasma and to anxious and depressive behaviors. However, the
mechanisms by which the release of CRF is regulated by trans-
mitter switching are unclear.
Neuronal activity has been shown to play an essential role in
neurotransmitter switching in the developing nervous system:
Ca2+ spikes regulate transmitter respecification of glutamate and
GABA non–cell-autonomously by the release of BDNF in the
developing Xenopus spinal cord (4–7). Additionally, the ventro-
lateral suprachiasmatic nucleus (SCN) receives retinal projections
from the direct retinohypothalamic tract and indirect geniculohy-
pothalamic tract and entrains internal circadian oscillation to the
external light/dark cycle (8–10). These photic signals induce
rhythmic c-Fos expression in the SCN (11–13). The PaVN receives
direct input from light-sensitive SCN neurons (14–17).
Here, we determined the role of neuronal activity in the regulation
of stress-dependent release of CRF in the adult rat, investigating
long-day photoperiod-induced transmitter switching in the PaVN.
Results
Activity Blockade in PaVN Dopaminergic Neurons Prevents Their
Transmitter Switch. We investigated the change in PaVN neuronal
activity in response to long-day photoperiod exposure, using c-Fos
as a marker for neuronal activation (18). A 77% increase in the
number of c-Fos+ cells was observed in the PaVN after 4 d, but not
after 2 d or 2 wk, of long-day photoperiod exposure (19L:5D),
compared with balanced-day photoperiod exposure (12L:12D) (Fig.
1 A and B). The results identify a period of elevation of PaVN
neuronal activity. Examining coexpression of c-Fos and tyrosine
hydroxylase (TH), a marker for dopaminergic neurons, we found a
63% increase in the number of neurons expressing both TH and c-
Fos after 4 d of 19L:5D compared with 12L:12D (Fig. 1 A and C),
indicating increased activity of PaVN dopaminergic neurons.
Neurotransmitter switching in the PaVN and subsequent behav-
ioral changes were detected previously only after 1 or 2 wk of
altered photoperiod exposure (3). Therefore, elevation in overall
PaVN neuronal activity and the activity of PaVN dopaminergic
neurons occurs before the detection of transmitter switching.
To investigate the role of elevated PaVN neuronal activity in
regulating transmitter switching that can control the subsequent
stress response, we suppressed the activity of PaVN dopaminergic
Significance
The discovery that neurotransmitter identity is regulated by
activity in the adult mammalian brain during a stress response
raises questions about the extent and function of this plastic-
ity. Specific synapses are associated with the release of a par-
ticular neurotransmitter or transmitters on the basis of evidence
obtained under a single set of conditions. Transmitter switch-
ing endows the connectome with greater plasticity: Activity-
dependent revision of signaling provides another dimension of
flexibility to regulate normal behavior. Changes in transmitter
identity are also positioned to contribute to diseases of the ner-
vous system. Neurotransmitter imbalance has long been impli-
cated in common neurological and psychiatric disorders, provoking
interest in transmitter switching as a therapeutic tool for patients.

 neurons specifically using TH-Cre transgenic rats stereotaxically in-
jected with a Cre-dependent adeno-associated virus (AAV)-double-
floxed inverse open reading frame (DIO)-inwardly rectifying potas-
sium channel (Kir). This TH-Cre rat line has been used successfully
in studies of ventral tegmental area (VTA) dopamine neuron
function and transmitter coexpression (19, 20). By hyperpolarizing
transfected neurons, Kir has been shown to inhibit action potentials
and elevations of intracellular Ca2+ (5, 21). AAV-DIO-EYFP was
used as a control. To allow sufficient viral expression, 4 wk after
injection rats were exposed to either 19L:5D or 12L:12D for 2 wk.
Kir expression indeed suppressed activity of PaVN dopaminergic
neurons examined by c-Fos expression (SI Appendix, Fig. S1C).
There was no difference in the number of TH+ neurons between the
Kir and EYFP groups after 12L:12D (Fig. 2), indicating that sup-
pressing the activity of PaVN dopaminergic neurons has no effect on
their TH expression in response to the balanced-day photoperiod.
However, after a 2-wk exposure to 19L:5D, there was a marked
decrease in the number of TH+ neurons in the control EYFP group
(Fig. 2), consistent with previous results (3). No significant apoptosis
was detected in EYFP-expressing rats exposed to either 12L:12D or
19L:5D, indicating the decrease in dopaminergic neurons was not
associated with cell death (SI Appendix, Fig. S1 A and B). This de-
crease in the number of TH+ neurons was abolished in the Kir group
following 19L:5D exposure. Blocking elevated activity of PaVN
dopaminergic neurons resulted in significantly more TH+ neurons
after long-day exposure compared with the EYFP control; the
number of TH+ neurons was no longer significantly different from
the number following balanced-day exposure (Fig. 2). This result
suggests that suppressing electrical activity of PaVN dopaminergic
neurons is sufficient to block their transmitter switch elicited by ex-
posure to the long-day photoperiod.
Switchable PaVN Dopaminergic Neurons Coexpress the Vesicular
Glutamate Transporter 2. Neurotransmitter coexpression and cor-
elease have been reported in many areas of the adult mammalian
brain (20, 22–25). Previous studies of neurotransmitter expression
patterns in the PaVN have revealed coexpression of a myriad of
neuropeptides (26). However, transmitter coexpression of dopa-
mine with classical neurotransmitters, such as glutamate, has yet to
be examined in the PaVN. Vesicular glutamate transporter 2
(VGLUT2) is the dominant form of synaptic vesicle transporter for
glutamatergic neurons in the hypothalamus and midbrain (27, 28).
We performed immunostaining of TH and VGLUT2 to examine
the colocalization of the two proteins in the same cell bodies in the
PaVN of rats maintained on the 12L:12D photoperiod (Fig. 3A). At
the protein level, 49.0 ± 2.7% of PaVN dopaminergic neurons
coexpressed VGLUT2 (1,170 of 2,379 neurons from four animals).
However, TH+/VGLUT2+ neurons constitute only 9.9 ± 0.6% of all
neurons expressing VGLUT2 (397 of 4,197 neurons from three
animals). At the RNA level, we used RNAscope, a highly sensitive
fluorescent in situ hybridization method capable of detecting indi-
vidual RNA molecules, to examine the co-occurrence of TH mRNA
and VGLUT2 mRNA puncta in the same cell bodies in the PaVN.
TH immunostaining was performed with RNAscope to reliably
identify cell boundaries of dopaminergic neurons (Fig. 3B). A total
of 47.7 ± 2.6% of TH protein+ cell bodies contained both TH
mRNA and VGLUT2 mRNA puncta in the PaVN (280 of
582 neurons from three animals), indicating significant coex-
pression of TH and VGLUT2 at the mRNA level as well. The
activity of PaVN VGLUT2+ neurons increased significantly after
4 d of 19L:5D exposure, but the number of VGLUT2+ neurons in
the PaVN remained unchanged after 2 wk of exposure to 19L:5D
(SI Appendix, Fig. S2 A–C).
We hypothesized that these two subpopulations of PaVN
dopaminergic neurons, VGLUT2+ versus VGLUT2−, decrease
their expression of TH to different extents after 19L:5D expo-
sure. To test this hypothesis, we counted the number of neurons
expressing both TH and VGLUT2 (TH+VGLUT2+) and the
number of neurons expressing only TH (TH+VGLUT2−) in the
PaVN after 2 wk of exposure to 19L:5D or 12L:12D. Interestingly,

 only TH+VGLUT2+ neurons decreased significantly in number
after 19L:5D, by 35.0% (Fig. 3C). This result demonstrates that
the neurotransmitter switch of PaVN dopaminergic neurons oc-
curs only in the subpopulation that coexpresses VGLUT2.
An elevated blood plasma cortisol level, indicating an acti-
vated HPA axis, is associated with the stress response induced by
exposure to the 19L:5D photoperiod (3). PaVN CRF neurons
express excitatory glutamate receptors, and glutamate stimulates
CRF release (2, 29). Since we observed significant overlap be-
tween the PaVN glutamatergic and dopaminergic neuronal
populations, we investigated whether PaVN CRF neurons also
receive inhibitory dopaminergic input by immunostaining of
CRF and dopamine type 2 receptor (D2R), an inhibitory dopa-
mine receptor. Indeed, at the baseline level, 43.7 ± 2.0% of
PaVN CRF neurons expressed D2R. After 2 wk of 19L:5D ex-
posure, the percentage of CRF neurons expressing D2R de-
creased to 26.6 ± 3.6% (Fig. 3 D and E and SI Appendix, Fig. S2
D and E).
Collectively, these results suggest a mechanism by which the
decreased number of PaVN dopamine- and glutamate-coexpressing
neurons after 19L:5D exposure leads to the stress response. The
excitatory synaptic input to CRF neurons remains the same, while
the expression levels of both presynaptic dopamine and inhibitory
postsynaptic D2R decrease, leading to increased activity of post-
synaptic CRF neurons and subsequent activation of the HPA axis.
Homeostatic Decrease of PaVN Inhibitory Dopaminergic Neurons
Following Activity Blockade of PaVN Excitatory Glutamatergic Neurons.
Activity-dependent transmitter switching in the developing nervous
system is often compensatory and homeostatic (6, 30). Accordingly, we
investigated whether manipulating the neuronal activity of PaVN ex-
citatory glutamatergic neurons changes the number of inhibitory do-
paminergic neurons in the adult rat brain. To suppress the activity of
PaVN glutamatergic neurons, AAV-DIO-Kir was injected, together
with a Cre-expressing AAV virus driven by the CaMKII promoter
(AAV-CaMKII-Cre) that has been commonly used to target ex-
citatory glutamatergic neurons (31). AAV-DIO-Kir was replaced
with AAV-DIO-EYFP in the control group. Animals were main-
tained on a 12L:12D light/dark cycle throughout the experiment.
The viral infection profile reflects the coexpression profile of do-
pamine and glutamate in PaVN neurons noted above (8.9 ± 1.3%
of all virus+ neurons are also TH+, 811 neurons from three animals;
46.7 ± 11.0% of all TH+ neurons are also virus+, 522 neurons from
three animals). Kir expression in glutamatergic neurons effectively
reduced neuronal activity in the PaVN, as indicated by a 49%
decrease in the number of PaVN c-Fos+ cells (SI Appendix, Fig. S3
A and B). We observed a significant decrease in the number of
PaVN TH+ neurons in the CaMKII-Kir group compared with the
control (Fig. 4 A and B), indicating that suppressing the activity of
PaVN excitatory neurons decreases the number of PaVN inhibitory
dopaminergic neurons. Cell death is unlikely to have contributed to
the decreased number of dopaminergic neurons since the total
number of neurons, neuronal density, and percentage of apoptotic
cells in the PaVN remained unchanged between the CaMKII-Kir
and CaMKII-EYFP groups (SI Appendix, Fig. S3 C–G).
To test the specificity of the homeostatic decrease in PaVN
dopaminergic neurons, we investigated whether suppressing the
activity of glutamatergic neurons affects other neurotransmitters
in the PaVN. Nitric oxide (NO) is expressed in the PaVN and is
differentially expressed in patients and animal models of stress
and depressive disorders (32–34). Dopaminergic neurons and
neurons expressing neuronal nitric oxide synthase (nNOS), a
marker for NO neurons, are intermingled but separate pop-
ulations in the PaVN. There is no difference in the number of
PaVN nNOS+ neurons between the CaMKII-Kir and CaMKII-
EYFP groups (Fig. 4 C and D), suggesting that suppressing the
activity of PaVN glutamatergic neurons does not change the
number of PaVN NO neurons. Therefore, the observed decrease

 in the number of PaVN dopaminergic neurons appears to be
specific to this neuronal population following activity blockade of
PaVN glutamatergic neurons.
We then tested whether the decrease in the number of do-
paminergic neurons is caused by decreased neuronal activity of
glutamatergic neurons specifically or by a decrease in overall
neuronal activity in the PaVN. Global suppression of PaVN
neuronal activity was achieved by injecting AAV-DIO-Kir cou-
pled with a Cre-expressing AAV virus driven by the human
Synapsin promoter (AAV-Synapsin-Cre) (35). Since the PaVN
contains a significant number of GABAergic neurons (36) and
peptide-expressing neurons in addition to glutamatergic neurons,
Kir was likely expressed in all of these cell types. We observed a
49.9% reduction in the number of c-Fos+ cells in the PaVN of
animals maintained on a 12L:12D cycle, comparable to the level
of activity blockade achieved by suppressing glutamatergic neu-
rons alone (SI Appendix, Fig. S3 A, B, H, and I). However, there
is no difference in the number of TH+ neurons between the
Synapsin-Kir and Synapsin-EYFP groups (Fig. 4 E and F). These
results suggest that the decreased number of dopaminergic
neurons on a balanced light/dark cycle is caused specifically by
suppressing the activity of glutamatergic neurons in the PaVN,
further supporting the homeostatic regulation of neurotrans-
mitter switching in the adult nervous system.
Discussion
Cell Population-Autonomous Mechanism of Neurotransmitter Switching
in the Adult Brain. Many forms of neuroplasticity are regulated by
neuronal activity through either cell-autonomous or non–cell-
autonomous mechanisms. On one hand, it is well established that
elevated intracellular Ca2+ following depolarization serves as a
second messenger and can cause transcriptional and translational
changes of neurotransmitter synthetic enzymes, receptors, and ion
channels of the same neurons (37). On the other hand, cell secre-
tion and cell-to-cell surface signaling can be regulated by neuronal
activity and affect intracellular signaling of neighboring neurons
non–cell-autonomously. In the developing Xenopus spinal cord, the
mechanism through which neuronal activity regulates transmitter
switching is non–cell-autonomous through secretion of BDNF (5).
Our results indicate that c-Fos activity of both the total PaVN
neuronal population and PaVN dopaminergic neurons specifically
is elevated briefly during long-day photoperiod exposure. The
absence of elevation of c-Fos after 2 d was not surprising because
transmitter switching requires sustained activity over a period of
days; however, the observation that it has come down at 2 wk was
unexpected. Perhaps c-Fos builds up, triggers switching (5, 7), and
is then down-regulated in the face of continued stimulation
through a separate mechanism yet to be explored. The elevation in
neuronal activity occurs before previously detected changes in

 neurotransmitter expression or anxiety and depression-like be-
haviors. Given this temporal sequence of the changes, a long-day
photoperiod likely leads to elevated PaVN c-Fos activity through
the efferent projections from the retina to the SCN and then to
the PaVN, which in turn results in transmitter switching and
subsequent changes in behavior (3). We find that suppressing the
elevation of PaVN dopaminergic neuronal activity during the
long-day photoperiod blocks the transmitter switch, providing
experimental support for this hypothesis.
In the present study, suppressing the activity of the population
of dopaminergic neurons by Kir expression in TH-Cre rats was
sufficient to block their transmitter switch in response to long-
day photoperiod exposure. It would be challenging to test whether
manipulating the activity of single dopaminergic neurons changes

 their likelihood of switching transmitters after long-day exposure
in vivo. Theoretically, sparse infection of dopaminergic neurons by
either Kir or control virus, followed by long-day exposure, could
address whether manipulating the activity of single dopaminergic
neurons causes a transmitter switch. However, with the only cur-
rently available rat TH-Cre transgenic line targeting dopaminergic
neurons, 25.7 ± 2.2% of PaVN virus-infected neurons do not
express a detectable level of TH protein (SI Appendix, Fig. S1D).
This likely reflects the highly plastic and variable nature of TH
expression, since we frequently observe clusters of TH mRNA
puncta in the PaVN, implying the presence of neuron cell bodies
that are TH mRNA+ but TH protein− (Fig. 3B). The “ectopic”
expression in a TH-Cre mouse line has been attributed to suffi-
cient Cre expression in weakly TH mRNA or protein-expressing
neurons (38). The moderate decrease in the number of TH
protein+ neurons after long-day photoperiod exposure, the mis-
match between the “on or off” nature of the Cre-medicated re-
combination event, and the variable endogenous TH protein
expression level in TH-Cre rats would combine to introduce sig-
nificant variability to the sparse infection approach. We conclude
from our assay that transmitter switching in the adult brain is cell
population-autonomous; whether it is single cell-autonomous re-
mains to be tested.
Neurotransmitter Coexpression and Neurotransmitter Switch. Trans-
mitter switching and transmitter coexpression and corelease may
be intrinsically linked biological processes: Neurons that nor-
mally coexpress two or more neurotransmitters may up- or down-
regulate each individual transmitter differentially in response
to external stimuli and give rise to functional neurotransmitter
switching (39).
Coexpression of TH and VGLUT2 has been reported in rat
VTA and posterior hypothalamus in cell bodies in vitro and
in vivo (20, 40–42). Additionally, axons from VTA dopaminergic
neurons contain TH, VMAT, and VGLUT2, and they corelease
both dopamine and glutamate in the nucleus accumbens (20, 41,
43). Our study demonstrates the coexpression of TH and
VGLUT2 in the cell bodies of PaVN dopaminergic neurons both
at the mRNA level and at the protein level. We observed a
marked decrease in the number of PaVN TH+VGLUT2+ neu-
rons after 19L:5D exposure but no change in the number of
TH+VGLUT2− neurons. Given that the overall number of PaVN
VGLUT2+ neurons remains unchanged after 19L:5D exposure, it
is likely that neurons expressing both dopamine and glutamate at
12L:12D lose their dopamine expression after 19L:5D but retain
their glutamate expression.
It is intriguing that in all known cases of neurotransmitter
switching, only a moderate percentage of neurons express a
certain neurotransmitter switch, while the others expressing the
same transmitter in the same anatomical location do not. It has
long been speculated that neurons that switch their transmitter
and neurons that appear not to do so belong to different func-
tional subpopulations, but biological markers to distinguish them
have been lacking. In the present study, only VGLUT2+ PaVN
dopaminergic neurons undergo photoperiod-induced transmitter
switching, while VGLUT2− ones do not, suggesting that coex-
pression of neurotransmitters might be used to distinguish
switchable from nonswitchable neurons and elucidate their po-
tential functional differences. On the other hand, projection
patterns and connectivity within local circuits can also be used to
classify adjacent neurons expressing the same neurotransmitter
into different subgroups. Little is known about the projections
and local connectivity of PaVN DA neurons, which need to be
explored in future studies.
PaVN CRF neurons are potential targets of PaVN TH+VGLUT2+
neurons to mediate the light-induced stress response since they reside
in close proximity and express both ionotropic excitatory gluta-
mate receptors (29) and D2R inhibitory dopamine receptors
(Fig. 3 D and E). Removal of inhibitory input, in addition to
increased glutamate release, seems to be necessary for the acti-
vation of PaVN CRF neurons to trigger the stress response (44),
although previous studies have largely focused on the role of the
inhibitory neurotransmitter GABA. In the present study, down-
regulation of presynaptic TH coupled with decreased expression of
postsynaptic D2Rs provides a separate mechanism to reduce the
inhibitory input to CRF neurons, facilitating the activation of CRF
neurons by elevated activity of presynaptic glutamatergic neurons.
Elevated CRF release then triggers activation of the HPA axis and
contributes to the increased stress and anxiety behaviors observed in
rodents following exposure to long-day photoperiods.
Homeostatic
Regulation
of
the
Activity-Dependent
Transmitter
Switch in the Adult Brain. Accumulating evidence suggests trans-
mitter switching is regulated homeostatically by neuronal activ-
ity; that is, the changes of neurotransmitter phenotypes following
a given perturbation often attempt to compensate for the change
and retain stable function of the neuronal circuit. For example,
suppressing the activity of spinal neurons by removing extracel-
lular calcium or expressing Kir during development increased the
number of neurons expressing the excitatory neurotransmitters
glutamate and acetylcholine and decreased the number of neu-
rons expressing the inhibitory neurotransmitters GABA and
glycine. Enhancing neuronal activity caused the opposite changes
(6). Here, we observed that suppressing the neuronal activity of
excitatory glutamatergic neurons in the PaVN decreased the
number of inhibitory dopaminergic neurons, providing evidence
for homeostatic regulation of transmitter switching in the adult
brain. It is intriguing that PaVN dopaminergic neurons respond
to distinct stimuli by down-regulating their TH expression dif-
ferently, either after a long-day photoperiod or after silencing of
neighboring glutamatergic neurons. This may reflect their di-
verse roles in the PaVN stress circuitry, where both external
environmental stressors and internal stress signals from multiple
brain regions are integrated and processed. Homeostatic regu-
lation of the number of dopaminergic PaVN neurons in response
to the activity of glutamatergic neurons was not observed fol-
lowing 2 wk of long-day exposure. The absence of homeostatic
regulation in this case may be explained by a difference in
stimulus strength, if constitutive suppression of activity with Kir
is a stronger manipulation of activity than natural light exposure.
Model of Activity-Dependent Regulation of Transmitter Switching
Causing Light-Induced Stress. We propose a model of activity-
dependent transmitter switching in the adult rat PaVN leading to
photoperiod-induced stress (Fig. 5). The balanced-day photo-
period stimulates a low level of activity in PaVN glutamatergic
and dopaminergic neurons. By expressing both excitatory gluta-
mate receptors and inhibitory dopamine receptors, PaVN CRF
neurons also exhibit a low level of activity and a low level of CRF
is detected in the bloodstream. After stressful long-day photo-
period exposure, the activity of PaVN glutamatergic and dopa-
minergic neurons is significantly elevated. This leads to a
decrease in the expression of dopamine in the glutamate/dopa-
mine coexpressing neurons, while expression of glutamate is
sustained. Coupled with decreased D2R expression on CRF
neurons, the increased excitatory and decreased inhibitory inputs
to CRF neurons cause substantial CRF release and the sub-
sequent stress response. For simplicity, switching and non-
switching neurons are suggested to target the same CRF cells;
whether or not this is the case will be the subject of future work.
On the other hand, when the activity of PaVN glutamatergic
neurons is artificially suppressed during the balanced-day pho-
toperiod, PaVN dopamine expression decreases to maintain the
homeostatic regulation of CRF neuronal activity.

 Materials and Methods
Experimental Model and Subject Details. All animal procedures were performed
in accordance with institutional guidelines and approved by the University of
California, San Diego Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee. Female
TH-Cre Long–Evans rats, LE-Tg(TH-Cre)3.1Dei, were generously provided by Karl
Deisseroth, Stanford University, Stanford, CA. The rat colony was maintained by
breeding heterozygous female TH-Cre rats with male wild-type Long–Evans rats
from a commercial source (Crl:LE; Charles River Laboratories). The offspring were
genotyped using the following primers: Cre-forward AAGAACCTGATGGA-
CATGTTCAGGGATCG and Cre-reverse CCACCGTCAGTACGTGAGATATCTTTAACC
(19). Eight-week-old male TH-Cre offspring and their wild-type littermates
were used in the study. Rats were group-housed, with food and water ad
libitum, on a standard 12L:12D schedule (lights on at 7:00 AM) before any
experimental procedures. For balanced-day (12L:12D) and long-day (19L:5D)
photoperiod exposures, animals were housed singly in custom-made photo
chambers for the indicated amount of time.
Virus Injection. Eight-week-old male rats were anesthetized with isoflurane
during virus injection using a stereotaxic apparatus (David Kopf Instruments)
and Hamilton syringe (no. 7647-1) and needle (33-gauge, no. 7762-06). The
anterior PaVN (bregma: anteroposterior, −0.8; mediolateral, +0.8; dorso-
ventral, −7.2, −7.0) was targeted, and a total of 1 μL of viral vector was
injected into the PaVN unilaterally. The needle was left in place for 5 min
after each injection. Serial dilutions of viral vectors were tested in WT and
TH-Cre rats, and the lowest titers with a >50% infection rate after 4 wk were
chosen for experiments. The vendors and final physical titers of viral vectors
are as follows: AAVdj-CMV-DIO-Kir2.1-zsGreen, 3–5 × 1013 genome copies
(GC) per milliliter (GVVC-AAV-61; Stanford University Virus Core); AAVdj-
EF1a-DIO-EYFP, 6–10 × 1012 GC per milliliter (Karl Deisseroth; GVVC-AAV-13);
AAV1-hSyn-Cre-WPRE-hGH, 2.5 × 1012 GC per milliliter (CS0646; Penn Vector
Core); and AAV9-CaMKII0.4-Cre-SV40, 1.8 × 1013 GC per milliliter (CS0569-
3CS; Penn Vector Core).
Immunofluorescent Staining. At 10:00 AM–1:00 PM during the light cycle, rats
were deeply anesthetized with pentobarbital sodium and perfused trans-
cardially with 200 mL of 1× PBS, followed by 200 mL of 4% para-
formaldehyde (PFA) in 1× PBS. Brains were then removed and postfixed in
4% PFA in 1× PBS at 4 °C overnight, followed by 30% sucrose for 4–5 d at
4 °C until the brains sank. Coronal sections (40 μm) were cut with a micro-
tome and were ∼20 μm postprocessing; every third section of the anterior
PaVN was used for staining. Sections were incubated with a blocking solu-
tion (5% horse serum or 2% BSA in 1× PBS with 0.3% Triton X-100) for 2 h at
room temperature (RT, 22 °C), and then incubated at 4 °C in the blocking
solution with primary antibodies overnight. After rinsing in 1× PBS three
times, for 10 min each time, sections were incubated in the blocking solution
with secondary antibodies at RT for 2 h. Sections were then rinsed, mounted
on glass slides with 2% gelatin, and coverslipped using Fluoromount-G
(Southern Biotech) or ProLong Gold Antifade Mountant (Life Technologies).
Five sections were examined per animal.
We used the following primary antibodies: mouse anti-TH (MAB318;
Millipore), 1:200; rabbit anti-TH (AB152; Millipore), 1:500; mouse anti-
VGLUT2 (MAB5504; Millipore), 1:100; goat anti–c-Fos (SC-52-G; Santa Cruz
Biotechnology), 1:250; rabbit anti-nNOS (61-7000; Life Technologies), 1:500;
mouse anti-NeuN (MAB377; Millipore), 1:500; and guinea pig anti-GFP (132
005; Synaptic Systems), 1:4,000. We used the following Alexa Fluor IgG
secondary antibodies: 488 donkey anti-guinea pig, 488 donkey anti-rabbit,
555 donkey anti-Goat, 555 donkey anti-rabbit, and 647 donkey anti-mouse
(all at 1:300; Life Technologies or Jackson ImmunoResearch).
RNAscope in Situ Hybridization. We used an RNAscope Multiplex Fluorescent
Reagent Kit and Target Probes (Advanced Cell Diagnostics) for rat high-
resolution in situ hybridization of TH mRNA and rat VGLUT2 (Slc17a6) mRNA.
The experiment was performed according to the manufacturer’s instructions.
In an RNase-free environment, 16-μm fixed brain slices were sectioned and
mounted on a glass slide immediately after microtome sectioning and baked
in a 60 °C dry oven for 30 min; sections were ∼8 μm postprocessing. Sections
were rehydrated in PBS for 5 min before a 5-min incubation in 1× target
retrieval solution at 90–95 °C. Sections were then rinsed with distilled water
and 100% EtOH. Subsequently, sections were incubated with the following
solutions in the HybEZ humidified oven at 40 °C with rinsing steps in be-
tween: protease III, 30 min; target probes, 2 h; amplification (Amp) 1-fluo-
rescence (FL), 30 min; Amp 2-FL, 15 min; Amp 3-FL, 30 min; and Amp 4-FL,
15 min. Amp 1-FL, Amp 2-FL, Amp 3-FL, and Amp 4-FL are all reagents included
in the RNAscope Multiplex Fluorescent Reagent kit. Afterward, standard im-
munofluorescent staining was performed using rabbit anti-TH (1:500) to de-
tect TH protein in the same sections. Six sections were examined per animal.
Confocal Imaging. A Leica SP5 confocal microscope with a 25×/0.95 water-
immersion objective was used to acquire all fluorescent images. The z-axis
resolution of confocal images was 1.5 μm. For immunostained sections, a z-
step of 1.5 μm was used to acquire the confocal images, resulting in 12–
13 sections per stack. For cell counting, individual sections within the confocal
stacks were examined, without maximal projection. Example images are
maximum intensity projections of five sections of the confocal stack since
maximal projection of the full stack resulted in many overlapping cells. For
RNAscope, a z-step of 1 μm was used to acquire the confocal images, resulting
in eight sections per stack. Example images are maximal projections of all eight
sections of the confocal stack.
TUNEL Assay. We used an In Situ Cell Death Detection (TUNEL) Kit with TMR
Red (12156792910; Roche) to detect apoptosis. PFA-fixed brain sections were
mounted and dried on glass slides. After rehydration in 1× PBS for 5 min,
sections were refixed with 1% PFA for 20 min at RT before rinsing in 1× PBS
three times, for 5 min each time. Sections were then incubated in freshly
prepared permeabilization solution (0.1% sodium citrate and 1% Triton X-100)
for 1 h at RT. After rinsing, sections were incubated with TUNEL reaction
mixture (250 μL per section, 25 μL of terminal-deoxynucleotidyl transferase
solution + 225 μL of label solution) in a humidified chamber for 3 h at 37 °C in
the dark. The sections were rinsed and mounted with DRAQ5-Fluoromount
(1:1,000 dilution of DRAQ5 in Fluoromount-G). The positive control was
treated with DNase I (10 U/mL, M0303S; New England Biolabs) for 1 h at 37 °C
before the TUNEL reaction.

Model of activity-dependent control of transmitter switching in the
adult rat PaVN producing light-induced stress. (A) During the balanced-day
photoperiod, the low activity of PaVN glutamatergic (Glu) neurons and in-
hibitory dopaminergic (DA) neurons leads to low activation of PaVN CRF
neurons and a low stress response. (B) The shift to long-day photoperiod
increases activation of PaVN Glu and DA neurons. Some Glu/DA neurons lose
DA expression, while the level of Glu expression is maintained. Combined
with the decreased CRF D2R level, CRF neurons are strongly activated and a
high stress response is induced. (C) When the activity of PaVN Glu neurons is
artificially suppressed, PaVN DA neurons down-regulate DA expression
homeostatically. Whether both switching and nonswitching neurons target
the same CRF cells remains to be determined.

 Cell Number and Cell Density Quantification. For c-Fos, TH, nNOS, TUNEL, and
DRAQ5 quantification, individual sections within the 3D fluorescent confocal
image stacks without maximal projection were used to manually count the
number of cell bodies using the Leica Application Suite X software. For NeuN
number and density, 3D fluorescent confocal image stacks were quantified with
ImageJ software using the 3D objects counter and area measurement functions.
Only the virus-expressing side of the PaVN was counted for virus-injected
animals, while both sides of the PaVN were counted for the rest of the animals.
Statistics. Statistical analyses of the data were performed using Prism
7 software for the number of animals for each experiment indicated in the
figure legends. Means and SEMs were reported for all experiments. For
comparisons between two groups, Welch’s t test was used for normally
distributed data and the Mann–Whitney U test was used for data not nor-
mally distributed. For comparisons of more than two groups, ANOVA was
used for normally distributed data, followed by Bonferroni post hoc analysis
corrected for multiple comparisons. For data that were not normally dis-
tributed, the nonparametric Kruskal–Wallis test was used, followed by
Dunn’s post hoc analysis corrected for multiple comparisons. Values were
considered significantly different at P < 0.05.
