Abstract
Background: What do patients want when looking for an aesthetic surgeon? When faced with attributes like reputation, years in practice, testimonials,
photos, and pricing, which is more valuable? Moreover, are attributes procedure-specific? Currently, inadequate evidence exists on which attributes are
most important to patients, and to our knowledge, none on procedure-specific preferences.
Objectives: First, to determine the most important attributes to breast augmentation, combined breast/abdominal surgery, and facelift patients using
conjoint analysis. Second, to test the conjoint using an internet crowdsourcing service (Amazon Mechanical Turk [MTurk]).
Methods: Anonymous university members were asked, via mass electronic survey, to pick a surgeon for facelift surgery based on five attributes.
Attribute importance and preference was calculated. Once pre-tested, the facelift, breast augmentation and combined breast/abdominal surgery surveys
were administered worldwide to MTurk.
Results: The university facelift cohort valued testimonials (33.9%) as the most important, followed by photos (31.6%), reputation (18.2%), pricing
(14.4%), and practice years (1.9%). MTurk breast augmentation participants valued photos (35.3%), then testimonials (33.9%), reputation (15.7%),
pricing (12.2%), and practice years (3%). MTurk combined breast/abdominal surgery and facelift participants valued testimonials (38.3% and 38.1%, re-
spectively), then photos (27.9%, 29.4%), reputation (17.5%, 15.8%), pricing (13.9%, 13.9%), practice years (2.4%, 2.8%).
Conclusions: Breast augmentation patients placed higher importance on photos; combined breast/abdominal surgery and facelift patients valued
testimonials. Conjoint analysis has had limited application in plastic surgery. To our knowledge, internet crowdsourcing is a novel participant recruit-
ment method in plastic surgery. Its unique benefits include broad, diverse and anonymous participant pools, low-cost, rapid data collection, and high
completion rate.

In a highly preference-sensitive field such as aesthetic plastic
surgery, it is often challenging for plastic surgeons to under-
stand what their patients value most when seeking an aes-
thetic surgery. Some commonly held assumptions regarding
patient values, which are based on our practice’s clinical ex-
perience, are that patients seeking breast augmentation are
price conscious, those seeking combined breast and body
procedures (“mommy makeover”) place emphasis on the
photo gallery, and those seeking facial rejuvenation rely on
patient testimonials. However, no one has ever studied
whether these assumptions are true, and whether there are
procedure-specific valuations in these three aesthetic surgery
cohorts.

 Procedure-Specific Age Cohorts
As these three procedures tend to be highly age correlated,1
it would seem logical to infer different age cohorts value
aesthetic surgery attributes differently. Specifically, patients
seeking breast augmentation typically fall into the 18 to 35
year age group, those seeking a combined breast and ab-
dominal surgery tend to be 35 to 65 years old, and those
desiring facial rejuvenation procedures are 45 to 70 years.1
As age is highly associated with procedure interest, our
study used age as a proxy for interest in breast augmenta-
tion, combined breast and abdominal surgery, and facelift
procedures.
Conjoint Analysis
Instead of a traditional multiple choice survey, in which all
choices are equally weighted, we decided to identify which
attribute was the most important above all the others,
when patients were forced to make a tradeoff. One method
of preference elicitation is conjoint analysis, a tool tradition-
ally used in marketing, which analyzes how consumers
value goods and services. It measures the consumers’ pref-
erences by requesting them to trade off attributes in a pur-
chasing scenario. The attributes that are “traded off” are
less important to you than your final choice.2 Prior conjoint
analyses of aesthetic plastic surgery practices have shown
that the most important attributes were board certification
and referral method.3 Another found surgeon experience
and referral method as the two most important attributes.4
However, these studies are limited by single surgeon expe-
rience,3 geography, and sampling of patients interested in
all procedure types.3,4 In a systematic review of patients’
surgeon preferences, reputation and competency were the
most valued professional attributes. Also, patients relied on
word of mouth and physician referrals when choosing a
surgeon.5 This review however, included many types of
surgical procedures, and included not only surgeon but
also hospital attributes as well.
Amazon Mechanical Turk as a Novel
Participant Recruitment Instrument
Traditional recruitment methods for prospective studies
include open volunteer enrollment for laboratory or clinical
trials, email blasts, internet advertising, phone calls, and
word of mouth. These methods can be limited by subject
motivation, compliance, low response rates, recall bias,
and survey fatigue. Prospective enrollment can be logisti-
cally challenging, with the potential for low participation
rates, high costs, and resultant long recruitment periods.
Because of these limitations, we used an internet crowd-
sourcing service, called Amazon Mechanical Turk (MTurk)
(Seattle, WA).
Crowdsourcing is defined as a job outsourced to a group of
people in the form of an open call, usually over the Internet.6
MTurk is an online labor market comprised of international
“workers” who perform “human intelligence tasks” (“HITs”)
such as audio transcription, filtering adult content,34 or taking
surveys, that are difficult for computers to perform. The name
Mechanical Turk comes from a mechanical chess-playing au-
tomaton from the 18th century that was able to move pieces
to beat many opponents. While a technical marvel at the
time, the real genius lay in the diminutive chess master
hidden in the machine workings.7 Mechanical Turk was de-
signed to hide human workers in a mechanical process,
hence the name of the platform.
Currently, there are more than 500,000 workers in 190
countries.8 With a high self-reported demographic, MTurk
workers are primarily female, located in the United States,
median age 30 years, earn $30,000 US dollars annually.9,20
MTurk worker demographic was at least as representative
of the US population in regards to gender, age, race, and
education as traditional subject pools.9,20 MTurk as a
participant
recruitment method
has been
utilized in
economic,13-15 sociology,16 psychology,17,18 and behavioral
science research.10-12 The quality of MTurk worker output
has been shown to be comparable to traditional subjects in
several studies. For natural language processing tasks, such
as affect recognition and word similarity, combining the
output of a few workers equaled the accuracy of expert la-
belers.19 When compared to subjects recruited via online
discussion boards at a large mid-western university for
decision-making experiments, MTurk workers showed
only slight differences in the quantitative data compared to
other subjects, and no differences in the qualitative data.9
Sixty-nine percent of US and 59% of Indian workers report
“Mechanical Turk is a fruitful way to spend free time and
get some cash,” indicating most workers are not trying to
sustain a living by doing MTurk, but instead are college
students, or laborers “bored at work” who want to earn
extra money in their spare time.9 Participants are anony-
mous, which obviates the need for de-identification of
data and reduces social desirability bias in their responses.
Compared to traditional subject recruitment methods,
MTurk has the advantages of fast recruitment time, faster
experiment
cycle,
supportive
platform
infrastructure,
subject anonymity, “requester” ability for prescreening
“worker” qualifications, higher compliance rate, cultural
diversity, and low cost.34
We sought to determine, via conjoint analysis, which
attribute of an aesthetic plastic surgeon’s practice is most
valued by the breast augmentation, combined breast and
abdominal surgery, and facial rejuvenation cohorts when
seeking consultation. We also wanted to utilize an internet
crowdsourcing service, which to our knowledge, is a
novel participant recruitment method for plastic surgery
research.

 METHODS
Overview
We conducted a prospective, cross-sectional study of 750
volunteers recruited via MTurk, who had been screened
as those potentially interested in either breast augmenta-
tion, combined breast and abdominal surgery, or facial re-
juvenation procedures. There were 250 people in each of
the three procedure groups. Volunteers were asked to
pick a plastic surgeon based on a series of five attributes
presented to them. They were asked to make trade-offs
on certain attributes, and conjoint analysis was applied
to analyze the implicit valuation placed on these attri-
butes. The University of North Carolina Institutional
Review Board approved this study. Our study followed
the International Society of Pharmacoeconomics and
Outcomes Research (ISPOR) Guidelines for conjoint anal-
ysis design.21
Selection of Attributes and Levels
After sampling plastic surgery websites nation-wide, the
four most common attributes were chosen: photo gallery,
patient testimonials, reputation, and years in practice.
Consultation and procedure pricing was not frequently
listed on websites, but we felt this attribute was an im-
portant one for patients seeking consultation with an aes-
thetic plastic surgeon, since at the time of their decision
to book a consultation or a procedure, the patient has
this information when choosing whether or not to
proceed. Before and after photos of breast augmenta-
tions, combined breast and abdominal surgery, and face-
lifts were chosen from the Smart Beauty Guide (www.
smartbeautyguide.com, Garden Grove, CA) (with permis-
sion). There was no identifying patient or surgeon infor-
mation on these photos, and any metadata was scrubbed
from the photo. The faculty (5), residents (7), nurses
(4), students (1), and administrative assistants (4) were
asked to choose between a pair of before and after
photos. They were asked to pick the pair that represented
an “excellent result” and the pair that represented a “fair
result.” They were also asked if it was difficult for them
to choose which one was “excellent” vs “fair.” The
photos that were ranked “excellent” and “fair” the most
often, and which were not difficult to choose, were used
in the photo gallery of the conjoint analysis. Since pa-
tients’ total perceived quality of health care includes both
technical quality (eg, the ability to do the procedure cor-
rectly) and functional quality (eg, the manner in which
health care is delivered),35,36 we felt that these five attri-
butes represented both technical (photo gallery, reputa-
tion, years in practice), and functional (testimonials,
pricing) qualities.
Development of the Conjoint Analysis
We used Sawtooth Software (Orem, UT) to design a ba-
lanced and efficient group of 12 choice tasks: this number
has been shown in past work to be feasible for participants
to complete.22,23 Each of the 5 attributes were randomly
assigned one of three levels (Table 1), and participants
picked a plastic surgeon based on different scenarios with
varying attribute levels.
Pilot Survey
Prior to publication on MTurk, the facelift survey was first
administered to university wide community via a mass
email to test questionnaire validity. We administered an
anonymous, electronic survey to the University of North
Carolina community, which encompasses over 41,000
faculty, staff, and students in all departments, including
several satellite locations.33 Participant incentive included
two $50 Amazon gift cards. The survey was open for 1
month, and non-responders were sent a reminder email
after 2 weeks. Survey data was collected and analyzed via
Sawtooth’s online Discover Software (Orem, UT). After re-
fining the survey, the breast augmentation, combined
breast and abdominal surgery, and facelift surveys were
then
administered
to
participants
recruited
through
Amazon MTurk. Since participants are anonymous, and
individual surveys were not linked to specific participant
accounts, a reminder email was not feasible.
Amazon MTurk Surveys
Screening Questions
Workers were asked to choose which attribute was most
valuable when selecting an aesthetic plastic surgeon to do a
breast augmentation, combined breast and abdominal
surgery, or facelift procedure. To ensure that we surveyed
potential participants interested in the index procedure, we
only included patients stating they would be interested in
the procedure in the future by using this series of screening
questions: The first was the question, “Have you consid-
ered having a (the procedure) performed in the past?”
Participants were not excluded if they answered “no” to

 this question. The follow-up question was, “Would you
consider having a (the procedure) performed in the
future?” Participants were excluded if they answered “no”
to this question. Disqualified participants were not allowed
to attempt the survey a second time to prevent “gamesman-
ship.” These questions were intended to include only
serious participants, and not those that just wanted to earn
money.
Procedure Eligibility
In addition, we limited the eligibility for the breast augmen-
tation survey to ages 18 to 35 years, combined breast and
abdominal surgery 35 to 65 years, and facelift to 45 to 85
years, since these respective procedures are most common-
ly performed within these age groups.1 Men were excluded
from the breast augmentation and combined breast and ab-
dominal surgery surveys. A post-hoc facial rejuvenation
conjoint analysis was administered to men only to deter-
mine if attribute preference differed by gender.
Sample Size Calculation
Sample size calculation was performed using Johnson’s
Rule of Thumb:25,26
N � 500c
ðt � aÞ
N is the sample size needed. c is the number of levels for
each attribute. t is the number of tasks. a is the number of
attributes. For our conjoint analysis with 12 tasks (t), each
with 3 scenarios containing 5 attributes (a), each with 3
levels (c), the sample size needed (N) was 25 for each
group for an efficient design. The wage per survey was set
at $1, and the survey was closed when enough participants
were recruited.
Worker Training Pages
To ensure a high level of worker understanding, we included
several training pages at the beginning of our survey (available
as Supplementary Material at www.aestheticsurgeryjournal.
com). Workers who answered, “No” to the question, “Did you
understand all of the instructions?” were disqualified. The
training pages gave examples of the three levels for each of
the five attributes. For example, for the photo attribute,
workers were shown an “excellent,” “fair,” and “none avail-
able” photo for the procedure (breast augmentation, combined
breast and abdominal, or facelift surgery). Examples of “excel-
lent,” “fair,” and “none available” testimonials were shown.
We used graphical representation of the testimonial levels: 5
stars denoted “excellent,” 2 stars denoted “fair,” and “none
available.” Reputation was national, regional, or local recogni-
tion, depicted by an icon of the continental United States, the
southeast, and the state of Florida. While reputation can en-
compasses many factors such as board certification, fellowship
training, academic productivity, and teaching, we chose to
represent the concept of “reputation” with geographical icons,
to facilitate widespread understanding, and to limit cognitive
strain. Years in practice was either <10 years, 10 to 20 years,
or >20 years, symbolized by a diploma icon with these re-
spective years. Pricing was high, medium, or low, represented
by the symbols $$$, $$, or $.
Data Analysis
We performed descriptive analyses with means and propor-
tions. Sawtooth Software’s (Orem, UT) online Discover tool
was used to analyze the data. Discover uses Choice Based
Conjoint (CBC)30 empirical Bayesian (EB) methods31,32 to
obtain individual level utilities.24,26 Empirical Bayesian
methodology closely approximates the posterior means for
the individual level parameters. Utilities are numerical
values that represent the relative desirability of the levels
within each attribute. The higher the number, the more de-
sirable the characteristic is to participants. Each partici-
pant’s utilities are then used to calculate individual-level
attribute importance scores. Attribute importance scores
represent the relative importance of the five attributes,
given the range of levels used in the experiment.24,26
RESULTS
Pilot Facelift Survey
The pilot survey was emailed to the university community
on February 9, 2016. A reminder email was sent out after 2
weeks. The survey was closed on March 8, 2016. There
were 315 participants interested in the study, and 3 were
disqualified. Of those qualified, there were 211 complete
and 104 incomplete surveys, resulting in a 66.9% (211/
315) completion rate. Participants were primarily female
(174, 82%), aged 44.5 years (range 18-82 years), Caucasian
(81%), married/living with a partner (58%), held a profes-
sional/graduate degree (42%), with annual household
income >$90,000 (33%), and employed full time (82%)
(Table 2). There were 37 (18%) male respondents.
The most important attribute was testimonials (33.9%),
followed by photos (31.6%), reputation (18.2%), pricing
(14.4%), and years in practice (1.9%) (Figure 1). The
utility scores for all attributes are detailed in Table 3.
MTurk Breast Augmentation Group
The duration to accrual to 250 participants was 6 days
(April 6-12, 2016). There were 601 participants interested
in the study, and 278 were disqualified. Of those qualified,
here were 250 complete and 73 incomplete surveys, result-
ing in a 77.4% (250/323) completion rate. The worker
wage per survey was $1. Survey completion time averaged
6 minutes and 42 seconds, equating to an hourly wage of
$8.87 (minimum wage in North Carolina is $7.25 per

 percent of participants have considered a facelift in the past,
and 100% were considering having it done in the future.
Participants were mostly female (78%), averaging 54.7
years (range 45-85 years), Caucasian (91%), married/living
with a partner (64%), held a bachelor’s degree (35%), with
annual household income of $45,000 to $74,999 (30%), and
employed full time (55%) (Table 2).
The most important attribute was testimonials (38.1%),
followed by photos (29.4%), reputation (15.8%), pricing
(13.9%), and years in practice (2.8%) (Figure 4, Table 6).
Since 22% of participants were male, we wanted to know
if attribute importance was different in men. Therefore, we
administered a post-hoc facelift conjoint survey to 250 men.
There were 3088 interested participants, and 2456 were dis-
qualified. Of the qualified participants, there were 250 com-
plete and 381 incomplete surveys, resulting in a 65.9%
completion rate (250/381).
Participants in this group were male (100%), averaging
51.5 years (range 45-85 years), Caucasian (61%), married
(64%), held a bachelor’s degree (47%), earned an annual
household income of $45,000 to $74,999 (31%), and em-
ployed full-time (80%).
In the male facelift group, the most important attribute
was testimonials (36.9%), followed by photos (29.4%),
reputation (18.1%), pricing (12.3%), and years in practice
(3.4%) (Figure 5, Table 7). The utility scores for all attri-
butes are detailed in Tables 6 and 7.
DISCUSSION
Generation Gap
Our study showed that in the breast augmentation cohort,
photos were slightly more important than testimonials. In
the combined breast and abdominal surgery and facelift
cohorts, testimonials were clearly more important than
photos. This discrepancy could represent different valua-
tions based on age and generational differences. It is well

 known that Millennials, defined as those born from 1984 to
2004,28 grew up in an online era within a socially net-
worked world. Millennials grew up with internet and are fa-
miliar with digital images. This may explain why the
younger breast augmentation cohort placed higher impor-
tance on photos than other attributes. Millennials are also
highly motivated, highly demanding, but highly produc-
tive.28 Also, younger patients display more price sensitivity
(possibly due to less net wealth), which could explain why
breast augmentation is less price inelastic than facelift.
The combined breast and abdominal surgery and facelift
cohort, which placed testimonials as the most important at-
tribute, fall into the Generation X (born 1965 to 1984) and
Baby Boomers (born 1946 to 1964) category. For Generation
X, “relationships are their greatest fear and their greatest
need.” In addition, “subjective experience validates if some-
thing is real and good.”27,29 For this group, perhaps a great
testimonial validates the subjective experience had by that
patient. Baby Boomers, with their strong work ethic and
loyalty, may value a great testimonial from a trusted friend
as the most important endorsement of a surgeon.
Testimonials were most important to facelift patients regard-
less of gender, as seen in the comparison between the cohorts of
primarily women (78%) (Figure 4) to men (100%) (Figure 5).
Internet Crowdsourcing as a Novel
Participant Recruitment Method
In addition to showing age- and procedure-specific impor-
tance attributes, to our knowledge, this study is also the
first to use Internet crowdsourcing as a participant recruit-
ment method in plastic surgery research. This novel recruit-
ment method has the advantages of fast recruitment time,
faster data collection, supportive platform infrastructure,
subject anonymity, “requester” ability for prescreening
“worker” qualifications, higher compliance rate, cultural

 diversity, and low cost. If adopted by the plastic surgery
community, it may prove to be a powerful and efficient par-
ticipant recruitment method.
Comparison of Pilot and MTurk data
The collection duration of the pilot and MTurk facelift
surveys was longer at 10 days in comparison to the breast
augmentation and combined breast and abdominal surgery
surveys, which took 6 and 4 days, respectively. This likely re-
flects a greater number of younger participants online than
older, thus resulting in faster accrual to 250 for the breast
augmentation and combined breast and abdominal surgery
groups. Another reason for the longer accrual time in the
MTurk facelift group is that there were a large number of dis-
qualified participants (2854) and incomplete surveys (705).
We hypothesize that many were disqualified because they
did not meet age criteria (45-85 years), and likely the
disqualified participants were younger. This is supported by
the fact that the average age in this group was 54.7 years.
The larger number of incomplete surveys in the facelift
group (705), compared to the breast augmentation (73), and
combined breast and abdominal surgery (108) groups, we
hypothesize, could be due to the complexity of judging a
“good” vs a “bad” facelift compared to breast augmentation
and combined breast and abdominal surgery.
Attribute Importance
In contrast to null hypothesis significance testing, in which
a P value <.05 indicates a small probability of the null hy-
pothesis is true, attribute importance is calculated by
Bayesian statistics, which result in probability values that
are used to compare the relative support of one hypothesis
over another.32 The importance scores of 35.3% for photos
and 33.9% for testimonials in the breast augmentation

 group are likely too similar to conclude that photos are sig-
nificantly more important than testimonials. We can con-
clude that in the breast augmentation group, photos and
testimonials were the two most important attributes. In the
combined breast and abdominal surgery, and facelift
groups, testimonials was the most important, with the
photo attribute as a more distinctly secondary attribute
compared to in the breast augmentation group.
The Importance of Number of Years in
Practice
One unexpected result was the relatively low importance of
years in practice to all cohorts. While the implications of
being in practice for >20, 10 to 20, and <10 years is signif-
icant to plastic surgeons, patients may not perceive the
nuances of years in practice, and therefore this attribute
may not have the same implication to them. The impor-
tance score is affected by the degree of difference between
attribute levels. As the actual or perceived difference
between levels narrows, the importance of that attribute
decreases. For example, if the three levels of prices were $1,
$2, or $3, the importance of the price attribute diminishes.
A future consideration would be to use discrete numbers
with greater separation in years (eg, 5, 20, 35 years) instead
of intervals of years.
Strengths
This study had a larger sample size than previous studies
on conjoint analysis. The 250 participants in each group
was a sufficiently large enough sample to ensure an effi-
cient design. Furthermore, participants were international,
and not limited to one surgeon’s practice or geographic lo-
cation. The preferences were procedure-specific, in com-
parison to other conjoint analyses in plastic surgery,3,4 that
sampled patients interested in all procedures.
Due to the ease of survey completion (average time 6
minutes, 49 seconds), and relatively high wage per survey
(average $8.76/hour, which is higher than the $7.25/hour
minimum wage in North Carolina), we had a large number
of interested participants, reflected by the high survey com-
pletion rates. The survey durations were short, no longer
than 10 days, allowing for rapid data collection. The total
cost of MTurk survey administration was $1050 for 750 par-
ticipants ($750 for 750 participants plus a $300 service
charge for three surveys).
Due to survey screening, we captured a high number of
interested participants. To ensure that participants were
truly interested in the procedure, we had two screening cri-
teria. The first was a series of questions, beginning with the
question, “Have you considered having a (the procedure)
performed in the past?” Participants were not excluded if
they answered “no” to this question. The follow-up
question was, “Would you consider having a (the proce-
dure) performed in the future?” Participants were excluded
if they answered “no” to this question. These questions
were
intended
to
include
only
serious
participants.
Disqualified participants were not allowed to attempt the
survey a second time.
Limitations
Given the five attributes selected, our results showed that
photos and testimonials were the most important attri-
butes. If different attributes had been selected, attribute im-
portance may differ. Attribute selection was performed by
the research team. An alternative approach could have
utilized participant selected attributes in the conjoint
analysis.
An additional screening criterion to encourage accrual
of participants interested in the procedure was to include
participants in the 18 to 35 year range for breast augmenta-
tion, 35 to 65 years for the combined breast and abdominal
surgery, and 45 to 85 years for the facelift groups. Age has
been shown to have a high correlation with interest in the
respective procedures.1 This age limitation could have ex-
cluded participants outside of the age range interested in a
particular procedure. This may contribute to an underesti-
mation of average age in the breast augmentation group,
and an overestimation of average age in the facelift group.
One potential limitation of MTurk could be multiple
survey responses from one participant. A participant could
attempt to cheat the system by registering more than one
account with several different email addresses. The partici-
pant could then theoretically take the survey multiple times,
answering the same way each time, in order to earn the
wage. Due to Amazon’s detailed worker vetting process,
which includes a requirement for a SSN/EIN, and strict poli-
cies against this practice, it is highly unlikely that one worker
can be registered to multiple accounts. Nonetheless, to
decrease this risk, we designed our survey so that if a partici-
pant was disqualified for any reason, they were not allowed
to retake the survey.
Another potential method of circumventing the survey
process could be the usage of random number generators
to generate the survey completion code required for partici-
pants to claim their wages on MTurk. This could allow par-
ticipants to skip the survey altogether and just receive the
funds. If this were the case, then we would have seen more
of a decrease in our account funds relative to completed
surveys.
Another limitation is that conjoint analysis assumes all
products are equally available. Not all of the attributes
listed are available on a website in real life. Therefore,
worker responses may not accurately reflect potential
buyers. In reality, many may not have the access, authority,
or ability to purchase said product.

 Furthermore, conjoint analysis assumes perfect informa-
tion. In the conjoint analysis training page, workers are ed-
ucated about the attributes and their levels. In the real
world, websites with a higher SEO on Google will have
more site visits than those who appear lower on the search
engine page. The former will have a higher chance of being
visited, and those surgeons will have a higher rate of
booking consultations. Conjoint analysis cannot fully
account for the differences in awareness developed through
advertising and promotion.
Despite these limitations, conjoint analysis can be an ex-
cellent directional indicator, but not a predictor of market
behavior.
Future Directions
We plan to elicit preferences with conjoint analysis for
other aesthetic plastic surgery procedures. The data we
gathered elucidates the motivations for patients coming in
for consultation. We plan to study the decision-making pro-
cesses that aesthetic and breast reconstruction patients
undergo when deciding to book surgery, when deciding to
undergo another procedure, and when recommending the
surgeon to peers.
CONCLUSIONS
The results of our research could potentially help aesthetic
plastic surgeons tailor their marketing strategies to increase
new patient consultations. It highlights the need to have a
photo gallery as well as testimonials on the practice website
to attract patients seeking breast augmentation, combined
breast and abdominal surgery, and facial rejuvenation sur-
geries.
