Background: The aim of this pilot study was to assess whether both ubiquitous and heterogeneous somatic mutations
could be detected in cell-free DNA (cfDNA) from patients with early-stage non-small-cell lung cancer (NSCLC).
Patients and methods: Three stage I and one stage II primary NSCLC tumors were subjected to multiregion whole-
exome sequencing (WES) and validated with AmpliSeq. A subset of ubiquitous and heterogeneous single-nucleotide var-
iants (SNVs) were chosen. Multiplexed PCR using custom-designed primers, coupled with next-generation sequencing
(mPCR-NGS), was used to detect these SNVs in both tumor DNA and cfDNA isolated from plasma obtained before surgi-
cal resection of the tumors. The limit of detection for each assay was determined using cfDNA from 48 presumed-normal
healthy volunteers.
Results: Tumor DNA and plasma-derived cfDNA was successfully amplified and sequenced for 37/50 (74%) SNVs
using the mPCR-NGS method. Twenty-five (68%) were ubiquitous and 12 (32%) were heterogeneous SNVs. Variant de-
tection by mPCR-NGS and WES-AmpliSeq in tumor tissue was well correlated (R2 = 0.8722, P < 0.0001). Sixteen (43%)
out of 37 SNVs were detected in cfDNA. Twelve of these were ubiquitous SNVs with a variant allele frequency (VAF) range
of 0.15–23.25%, and four of these were heterogeneous SNVs with a VAF range of 0.28–1.71%. There was a statistically
significant linear relationship between the VAFs for tumor and cfDNA (R2 = 0.5144; P = 0.0018). For all four patients, at
least two variants were detected in plasma. The estimated number of copies of variant DNA present in each sample
ranged from 5 to 524. The average number of variant copies required for detection (VCRD) was 3.16 (range: 0.2–7.6
copies).
Conclusions: The mPCR-NGS method revealed intratumor heterogeneity in early-stage NSCLC tumors, and was able
to detect both ubiquitous and heterogeneous SNVs in cfDNA. Further validation of mPCR-NGS in cfDNA is required to
define its potential use in clinical practice.

introduction
Increasing evidence supports the existence of intratumor hetero-
geneity in various solid tumor types, including non-small-cell
lung cancer (NSCLC) [1], and can present significant challenges
for effective tumor control. For example, single biopsies may
result in sampling bias that limits the ability to identify thera-
peutically targetable lesions and markers of acquired drug resist-
ance [2–4].
Multiregion tumor sampling to reveal the clonal architecture
of tumors, and serial tumor sampling to identify emergent tar-
getable drivers of disease during cancer progression, may help
overcome these hurdles but are practically challenging and not
standard clinical practice. An alternative approach, which uses
liquid biopsies to detect circulating biomarkers, such as plasma
cell-free DNA (cfDNA), may offer a relatively simple and non-
invasive method to analyze primary and metastatic tumors [5],
identify biomarkers that can inform treatment stratification, and
allow for the monitoring of residual disease and the emergence
of molecular resistance [6]. However, the sensitivity of cfDNA
techniques to identify heterogeneous mutations in early-stage

 tumors has not been addressed. Several studies have demon-
strated that genetic aberrations in tumors, including somatic
copy number aberrations (SCNAs) [7, 8] and single-nucleotide
variants (SNVs) [9–13], can be detected in cfDNA. These aber-
rations can be used to track the mutational burden and tumor
evolution in patients over time [13–17], with ubiquitous muta-
tions occurring early in tumor evolution (predicted to be clonal
in origin), and heterogeneous mutations occurring late in tumor
evolution (predicted to be subclonal in origin) [18, 19]. However,
it has yet to be determined how representative cfDNA is of the
tumor genomic landscape [20, 21], and whether both ubiqui-
tous and heterogeneous mutations can be detected [11]. We
present here a pilot study using multiplexed PCR (mPCR) and
next-generation sequencing (NGS) (mPCR-NGS) to determine
whether selected ubiquitous and heterogeneous mutations from
early-stage NSCLCs can be identified in cfDNA before surgery
and estimate the sensitivity of variant detection.

 HiSeq 2500 platform (Illumina) with a mean sequencing depth of ×207.
Custom AmpliSeq targeted DNA panels (Life Technologies) were designed
online (http://www.ampliseq.com). Sequencing was carried out on the Ion
Torrent PGM™ sequencer (Life Technologies) with 200 bp reads at a mean
sequencing depth of ×1198.
multiplex PCR and next-generation sequencing
mPCR-NGS analysis was blinded with respect to what was detected by
WES-AmpliSeq. Before mPCR-NGS, the concentration and integrity of
cfDNA samples were determined using the hgDNA Quantification and QC
Kit (Kapa Biosystems, Boston, MA) with long (305 bp) and short (41 bp)
amplicons. cfDNA from 1 or 1.5 ml of plasma was used to prepare amplified
libraries. This involved blunt-end repair, A-tailing, ligation to adaptors,
amplification, and purification. In addition to the cfDNA samples from the
patients with cancer, 48 presumed-negative control cfDNA samples derived
from the plasma of healthy individuals (nonpregnant females) with similar
input DNA levels were also used to prepare libraries. The amplified libraries
and the gDNA samples (tumor regions and corresponding germline DNA)
were then analyzed by mPCR-NGS. PCR primers targeting SNVs detected
in the analysis of the tumor samples were designed using the primer3 soft-
ware package [22].
statistical methods
Target assays with <100 reads (gDNA) or <10 000 reads (plasma) were
considered to have failed and not analyzed further. A background-error
model for each genomic position with all possible base substitutions was
constructed using sequences from the presumed-normal plasmas from the
negative control samples. Noisy positions with a normal median variant
allele frequency (VAF) of >0.5% and outlier samples [>10 standard devia-
tions (SDs) from the mean VAF] were removed.

Oncology online.
results
Four patients (L012, L013, L015, and L017) were analyzed in this
pilot study. Three patients had stage I squamous cell carcinoma
and one patient had stage II adenocarcinoma (Figure 1). All
patients were current smokers, with no evidence of lymph node
involvement, and their mean age was 66.5 years. Multiregion
WES followed by Ion AmpliSeq deep-sequencing validation was
used to identify somatic mutations present in each of the 11
tumor regions (Figure 1). Consistent with previous findings [1],
intratumor heterogeneity was demonstrated in all tumors
(Figure 1).
Overall, 50 SNVs were selected from the primary sequencing
data (WES-AmpliSeq) for detection in tumor DNA and cfDNA
using the mPCR-NGS method. These SNVs were selected to re-
present both ubiquitous and heterogeneous mutations, as well as
clinically relevant driver mutations based on the driver category
classification as previously described [23]. For each selected SNV,
custom PCR primers were designed to amplify genomic DNA
from the tumor regions in an mPCR reaction and the PCR pro-
ducts were sequenced. Of the 50 selected SNVs, 12 assays failed
due to a low number of sequencing reads. The CYFIP1 variant
was identified as a sequencing artifact that was not validated by
AmpliSeq sequencing. The remaining 37 variants were further

 analyzed, of which 25 (68%) were ubiquitous variants and 12
(32%) were heterogeneous variants (Table 1). The median VAF in
the tumor DNA was 12.7% (range: 0.9%–73.1%) for ubiquitous
variants and 5.9% (range: 0.2%–18.6%) for heterogeneous var-
iants. The specific coding sequence and amino acid changes for
each variant are detailed in supplementary Table S2, available at
Annals of Oncology online. Thirty-one of the 37 (84%) SNVs were
category 1–3 predicted driver mutations. The VAFs ranged from
1.0% to 65.7% for WES-AmpliSeq and from 0.15% to 60.8%
for mPCR-NGS (Table 1). There was high concordance between
the VAFs determined by WES-AmpliSeq and by mPCR-NGS
with a significant linear correlation between the tumor regions
(R2 = 0.8722, P < 0.0001) (supplementary Figure S1, available at
Annals of Oncology online).
To determine whether mPCR-NGS could detect these variants
in the cfDNA, we first determined how much cfDNA was avail-
able from each patient. We found that the samples contained
7.44–11.2 ng DNA (supplementary Table S1, available at Annals
of Oncology online). To ensure we could correctly identify var-
iants in the cfDNA, we estimated the background noise and set a
limit of detection (LOD) for each mPCR-NGS assay by analyzing
each of the 37 variants in the cfDNA samples derived from 48
presumed-normal healthy volunteers. Analysis of these negative
control samples revealed that the mean background-error rate
varied from 0.002% to 0.343%. The error rates and their approxi-
mate 99.7% prediction interval are shown in Figure 2. To ensure a
conservative threshold for positive calls for the presence of var-
iants in the cfDNA, the LOD for each assay was set at 10 SD
above the mean VAF in the negative control samples (supplemen-
tary Table S1, available at Annals of Oncology online). Using
this threshold, 16 (43%) of the 37 variants were detected in the
cfDNA (supplementary Table S1, available at Annals of Oncology
online, and Figure 2); 9/10 (90%) of the variants from patient
L012, 3/9 (33%) from patient L013, 2/9 (22%) from patient L015,
and 2/9 (22%) from patient L017 were detected (Table 1).
Of the 16 variants detected in cfDNA, 12 (75%) were ubiqui-
tous variants, and 4 (25%) were heterogeneous variants based on
the prior tumor sequencing data (Table 1). The four heteroge-
neous variants in the genes CIC, FAT1, KDM6A, and MLLT4
were detected in cfDNA from patient L012. The median VAF in

 cfDNA was 3.85% (range: 0.15%–23.25%) for ubiquitous variants
and 0.88% (range: 0.28%–1.71%) for heterogeneous variants
(Figure 3A). Overall, VAFs for cfDNA from patient L012 were
markedly higher than those for patients L013, L015, and L017.
Using the VAF for each variant detected in the cfDNA and
the amount of starting cfDNA from each patient, the number of
copies of variant DNA in each sample was estimated. The
number of variant copies ranged from 5 (for ROS1) to 524 (for
NFE2L2) copies (supplementary Table S1, available at Annals of
Oncology online). Based on the LODs, we also calculated the
number of variant copies required for detection (VCRD), which
was set at 10 SD above the mean background noise of each
assay. Of the 16 variants detected, the average VCRD was 3.6
(range: 1–8 copies). All VAFs were greater than the VCRD,
except for ROS1, which was equal to the VCRD. None of the
variants were detected in the cfDNA from healthy volunteers.
The correlation between the average VAF among all tumor biop-
sies in which a mutation was detected, and the VAF of variants
detected in cfDNA was 0.5144 (P = 0.0018; Figure 3B).
discussion
Given the sampling bias associated with tumor biopsies, and the
difficulties of repeated tumor sampling, the use of cfDNA to
identify mutations that are therapeutically targetable or asso-
ciated with therapeutic resistance may have significant clinical
implications. In this pilot study, the mPCR-NGS method was
able to detect variants in tumor DNA and matched cfDNA with
good concordance, [24], and provides preliminary evidence of
how cfDNA can reveal the mutational burden in early-stage
NSCLCs. Of the 37 selected mutations, 16 (43%) were detected
in both cfDNA and tumor DNA; 4 (25%) of which were hetero-
geneous variants. Notably, over half (9/16) of the variants and
all of the heterogeneous variants detected in plasma were from
patient L012. Consistent with this, the VAFs in cfDNA from
this patient were considerably higher than those for the other
three patients; it is not clear why this was the case for this patient
with a stage I tumor, but factors, such as tumor vascularization
and the rate of tumor growth and apoptosis, may have played a
role [6].
Given the lower levels of variant DNA in the cfDNA from
patients L013, L015, and L017, it is not surprising that only
33.3% (9/27) of their variants were detected in plasma, or that
the two heterogeneous mutations from patient L017 were not
detected. For 5/16 (31.3%) variants detected in cfDNA, we esti-
mated that <10 molecules of the variant allele were present.
These data suggest that the primary limitation of this study was
insufficient starting cfDNA, particularly for patients L013, L015,
and L017. We expect that increased starting plasma volumes
would considerably improve the analytical sensitivity of mPCR-
NGS and enable the detection of mutations at lower VAFs.
Several previous studies have demonstrated the ability to detect
variants in plasma from patients with cancer with high con-
cordance between tumor and plasma DNA. However, these
studies have often been conducted in patients with metastatic
or relapsed disease [13, 17, 25–27], not early-stage disease, and
have generally shown sensitivity and high concordance for
selected mutations with high VAFs in the tumor or cfDNA [26,
27]. In contrast, candidate SNVs selected in this study included
both ubiquitous and heterogeneous variants, as well as clinically
relevant driver mutations, such that many of the target variants
were limited by low copy numbers and therefore had low VAFs.
This challenge was compounded by the small amount of starting
plasma material.
Current assessments of treatment response and disease pro-
gression rely on clinical examination and the presence of measur-
able disease on radiological imaging [28]. The detection of
disease recurrence or development of drug resistance based on
cfDNA analysis may precede such assessments, thereby permit-
ting earlier intervention. Validation of the use of circulating
biomarkers in clinical studies will be necessary to assess their effi-
cacy in practice [29]. One such study is TRACERx [TRAcking
Cancer

(Rx),
ClinicalTrials.gov
NCT01888601], which involves the longitudinal sampling of cir-
culating biomarkers, including cfDNA, to determine how well the
tumor evolutionary landscape is represented in the plasma of
patients with early-stage NSCLC, from diagnosis to relapse [30].
This study will also determine the feasibility of using circulating
biomarkers to monitor minimal residual disease and detect the
emergence of therapeutic resistance. The mPCR-NGS method
presented here will be applied to TRACERx to analyze cfDNA.
Although at present, detailed tumor profiling requires the direct
sequencing of tumors, studies such as TRACERx have the poten-
tial to facilitate the development of non-invasive techniques in-
cluding cfDNA analysis, for tumor profiling, real-time monitoring
