Editor's note
The study reported in this article examines a health intervention that uses gendered stereotypes of the nursing 
profession and suggestive uniforms that play on women’s sexuality to encourage people to engage in health 
checkups. The intervention was not under the control of the authors and the study was approved by an 
institutional research ethics board. The Journal of Epidemiology & Community Health condemns the use of sexism, 
gender and professional stereotypes and other forms of discriminatory or exploitative behaviour for any purpose, 
including health promotion programs. In light of concerns raised about this paper (see eLetters with this paper), 
we are conducting an audit of our review process and will put in place measures to ensure that the material we 
publish condemns sexism, racism and other forms of discrimination and embodies principles of inclusion and non-
discrimination. 
AbsTrACT
background Socioeconomically vulnerable people are 
likely to have more health risks because of inadequate 
behaviour choices related to chronic social stresses. Brain 
science suggests that stress causes cognitively biased 
automatic decision making, preferring instant stress relief 
and pleasure (eg, smoking, alcohol use and drug abuse) 
as opposed to reflectively seeking health-maintenance 
services (eg, health check-ups). As such, hedonic stimuli 
that nudge people towards preventive actions could 
reduce health behaviour disparities. The purpose of this 
intervention study was to test this hypothesis.
Methods An instant health check-up service company 
had 320 health check-up sessions at pachinko (Japanese 
gambling) parlours; 1721 persons in intervention 
sessions and 6507 persons in control sessions received 
the service. The stimuli the company used in the 
intervention sessions were young women wearing 
mildly erotic nurse costumes, who solicited the pachinko 
players for health check-up services. We compared the 
prevalence of socioeconomically vulnerable individuals 
between the intervention and control sessions, 
adjusting for individual-level and parlour-level potential 
confounders.
results Even adjusting for health risks and within-
parlour clustering, the intervention sessions gathered 
more socioeconomically vulnerable customers than 
the regular sessions. Compared with control sessions, 
in intervention sessions the adjusted prevalence ratios 
were 1.15 (95% CI 0.99 to 1.35) for not having a job 
(vs having a job) and 1.36 (95% CI 1.00 to 1.86) for 
holders of National Health Insurance (which includes 
more socially vulnerable people than other insurance 
programmes).
Conclusion The results supported our hypothesis. 
Offering health check-up opportunities equipped with 
’tricks’ that nudge people to act might be effective for 
anyone but is potentially more valuable for socially 
vulnerable people. Ethical discussions are needed to 
further consider the use of erotic stimuli and other 
essential drivers of human behaviour.
InTroduCTIon
Every year, millions die by non-communicable 
diseases globally. Diabetes, cardiovascular disease, 
lung disease and cancer—the four most prevalent 
non-communicable diseases—are key targets of 
recent global health activities. Many non-com-
municable diseases are associated with human 
behaviours. Therefore, public health promoters 
should target daily personal choices concerning 
diet, physical activity, consumption of tobacco and 
alcohol and the utilisation of healthcare services. 
Public health campaigns have aimed to increase 
individuals’ awareness of the risks of inadequate 
behaviours, expecting them to make healthier 
choices in reflective ways. However, recent system-
atic reviews suggest that these campaigns are not 
effective or only have small effects.1
There are two pillars in the goals of public health: 
improving overall population health and reducing 
health disparity across social classes. Evidence 
suggests that most diseases, both communicable 
and non-communicable, are more prevalent among 
socioeconomically vulnerable populations in terms 
of income/wealth, education and work.2 This is 
because inadequate health behaviours are also more 
prevalent among them.3 4 There are two alterna-
tive mechanisms that potentially cause inadequate 
health behaviour among the socially vulnerable: 
materialistic and psychosocial. First, impoverished 
people are materially deprived, having limited 
access to necessary goods and services to maintain 
their health. Second, chronic daily stressors due to

socioeconomic hardship (eg, financial insecurity, job insecurity 
or inadequate social comparisons against wealthier peers) may 
cause worry, frustration and anger, and alter health behaviours. 
Studies in social psychology and behavioural economics suggest 
that psychosocial stressors and the relevant negative emotions 
may strengthen cognitive biases for one’s preferences towards 
temporality and risks, resulting in short-sighted decisions. The 
effects of strong cognitive biases mirror the higher prevalence 
of hedonic and addictive behaviours, including tobacco, alcohol 
and drug use, among socially disadvantaged populations.1 2 5
Given this theoretical and empirical evidence, health-pro-
moting interventions aiming to reduce health disparities may 
perform better by targeting the automatic decision-making 
processes that, in theory, contribute more to socially vulnerable 
people. However, evidences on the effectiveness of those inter-
ventions regarding reducing health disparities are lacking. Recent 
studies have suggested potential triggers of automatic choices, 
including financial incentives, positive affect, peer pressures and 
hedonic or sexual attraction.6–10 In this study, we specifically 
focused on positive affect (ie, a positive feeling state induced 
by modest positive events).9 More specifically, we evaluated the 
effects of a sexually attractive young woman soliciting actions as 
a potential strong stimulus triggering behaviour change. Erotic 
stimuli can be a strong cue to action, given its inherence stem-
ming from human evolution.11
In this clustered, non-randomised controlled study, we tested 
this idea using real-world data: the data of the customers who 
obtained instant health check-up services at Japanese pinball 
(‘pachinko’) parlours, where there were many adults who were 
engrossed in an arcade game. In the intervention sessions, female 
staff members wore mildly erotic nurse costumes (ie, short 
skirts and typical nurse caps, figure 1). We hypothesised that, 
compared with regular health check-up sessions, socially vulner-
able customers may be more likely to obtain health check-ups in 
the intervention sessions. Since the solicitation was performed 
by a young female in this intervention, we believed the effect 
would be stronger for male pachinko players than for female 
players.
METhods
data
We used individual data from 8485 customers who used instant 
health check-up services (eg, measuring weight and height, 
blood glucose and other biomarkers of cardiovascular risk) 
provided by a company. The private company provides instant 
health check-up services. They provide these services at their 
own retail shops as well as mobile service sessions at alter-
native locations, such as shopping malls, local marketplaces 
and metro rail stations, which are frequented by many socially 
vulnerable people. The pachinko parlour is one such place. 
Pachinko is a type of commercial amusement arcade game 
originating in Japan. A player snaps small metal balls, and 
the balls cascade down a vertically set board with densely 
nailed pins. The balls may be captured by a jackpot or bingo, 
resulting in the release of more balls. Players try to gather as 
many balls as possible since each ball has value and players can 
exchange them for prizes. Many pachinko parlours also have 
slot machines. The pachinko market is large, with reported 
earnings of 34 862 billion yen in 2005.12 Like any form of 
gambling, pachinko has long been discussed concerning its 
strong link with addiction.13
The intervention
Between 2011 and 2013, the company operated 320 
health check-up sessions at 110 pachinko parlours. To over-
come the problem that pachinko players were not interested in 
the health services, in 63 sessions, the company hired young 
female staff members from temporary staff service companies 
(intervention sessions). To solicit customers, in intervention 
sessions these female staff members wore sexually attractive 
nurse costumes. In other sessions (control sessions), the staffs 
wore ordinary suits or regular medical white coats. The average 
number of staffs in a session was not systematically different 
between the intervention and control sessions, with one 
company staff who dealt with reception and health check-up 
services, and a few other staffs who solicited customers. The 
solicitation staffs wore nurse costumes in the intervention 
sessions. We thought that solicitation by the costumed young 
women might trigger individuals to take the examination due 
to automatic cognitive processes that shortcut reflective cost 
considerations.
These sessions comprised normal business activities, and no 
special arrangements were made for the sake of this study. The 
researchers did not provide financial subsidies to the company 
or the customers. Hence, the funding for the present study was 
used for data analysis and manuscript preparation.
Measurements
Socioeconomic status (SES). In the check-up sessions, 
customers responded to a brief, self-reported questionnaire 
that asked for information related to SES: occupational status 
and type of public health insurance. We generated two binary 
outcome variables representing having no job (vs have a job) 
and using National Health Insurance Services (NHIS) (vs other 
insurance types) as representing low SES. Japan has universal

public healthcare insurance coverage based on multiple insur-
ance schemes. Among them, NHIS mainly targets the self-em-
ployed or those without jobs, who are likely to be less socially 
privileged. Occupation was categorised as no job, home maker, 
part-time job, employee, self-employed, business manager, 
student or other. We dichotomised this variable as ‘no job’ or 
‘other'.
Covariates
From the information provided by the firm, we used age, time 
since last health check-up (years) and biomarkers from blood 
samples, including serum triglyceride, serum total cholesterol 
and fast blood glucose. For time since last check-up, we asked, 
"When did you get your last health check-up?" Response options 
were within 1 
year, 1–3 years, 4–9 years and 10 years or more. 
We dichotomised this variable as ‘0–3 years’ or ‘4 years or more’. 
Using dry blood spot sampling, blood tests were conducted by 
the customers themselves under staff guidance. The results 
were immediately reported and recorded in the database. The 
company staff members calibrated the blood test devices at the 
beginning of the daily sessions.
statistical analysis
First, we evaluated differences in the basic characteristics of 
customers who used the services between the intervention and 
control groups using a Χ2 test, a t-test or a Wilcoxon test, where 
appropriate. Since we only had access to the data of those who 
used the health check-up service, we could not calculate the odds 
of using the health check-up service among pachinko customers. 
Then, following a recent statistical recommendation, we used 
Poisson regression and calculated the prevalence ratios (PRs) of 
customers with poor SES in the check-up sessions using nurse 
costumes (intervention) against regular sessions (control).14 15 
When modelling covariates, the three biomarkers from the blood 
samples were log-transformed and standardised to normalise 
right-skewed distributions. Since data availability for the health 
check-up items depended on the customer’s choice, some data 
were missing. To address potential biases due to missing data, 
we employed multiple imputation, creating 100 fully imputed 
datasets and statistically combining them to obtain the esti-
mates of interest. Following recent statistical guidelines, we used 
expectation-maximisation with a bootstrapping algorithm.16–18 
We adjusted for within-parlour clustering, employing parlour 
random effects in the generalised estimating equation.19 For a 
robustness check, we conducted a sensitivity analysis based on 
the application of multiple imputation procedures (only data 
with complete cases or imputed) and clustering adjustments. We 
conducted both sex-combined and sex-stratified analyses. All 
P values were two-tailed. All analyses were conducted with the 
statistical package R V
.3.3.2 for Windows.
Patient involvement
No patients were involved in setting the research question or the 
outcome measures, nor were patients involved in planning the 
design or implementation of the study. No patients were asked 
for advice on the interpretation or presentation of the results.
rEsulTs
In total, 1721 persons (986 men and 735 women) participated in 
the intervention sessions and 6507 persons (3436 men and 3071 
women) participated in the control sessions. Additional charac-
teristics of interest are shown in table 1.
The results of Poisson regression showed that, even after 
adjusting for multiple covariates, customers with a low SES, 
defined as having no job and using NHIS, were more prevalent 
in the intervention sessions. The fully adjusted PRs were 1.36 
(95% CI 1.00 to 1.86) for NHIS holders and 1.15 (95% CI 
0.99 to 1.35) for not having a job. When stratifying by gender, 
women showed somewhat larger PRs than men; the adjusted PR 
of NHIS holders was 1.45 among women and 1.32 among men, 
while the PRs for not having a job were 1.27 among women and 
1.13 among men (table 2).
Sensitivity analyses using non-imputed (complete case) data 
provided stronger associations, specifically on the PRs for not 
having a job among women and weaker associations for women 
with NHIS (table 2). The full results of our sensitivity analysis 
are provided in online supplementary table S1.
dIsCussIon
The results supported our hypothesis: solicitation by young 
women wearing sexy nurse costumes to promote taking instant 
health check-up services gathered more socially disadvantaged 
pachinko players (ie, jobless or having NHIS). Interestingly, 
however, the finding was contradictory to our hypothesis on 
sex differences. That is, despite our expectations, the propor-
tion of socially disadvantaged people in intervention sessions 
were larger among women rather than men, suggesting stronger 
disparity-reducing effects for women than men.
Many studies on behaviour economics and marketing have 
investigated the effects of various incentives on altering personal 
choices. Thaler and Sunstein’s seminal work suggests that ‘choice 
architecture’, which is nudging people towards specific personal 
choices, could be a powerful strategy for social innovations.20 In 
the field of public health, most studies relevant to that subject 
have dealt with financial incentives.6 A randomised controlled 
trial by Blakely et al tested the impacts of price discounts on 
healthy foods at supermarkets on the levels of healthy food 
purchasing per consumers’ socioeconomic disadvantages. They 
found ethnicity differences in the intervention effects, but none 
across income or education levels.21 To our knowledge, few 
studies have investigated the effects of other behavioural change 
triggers including non-financial incentives and positive affect on 
socioeconomic disparities in health behaviour.9 22 Therefore, this 
study is the first to investigate the impacts of sexual stimuli as a 
trigger of positive affect inducing healthy behaviour and their 
variations by SES.
Based on an appraisal tendency framework and theoretical 
models on affect and behaviour choice, the potential underlying 
mechanisms of our findings may be twofold.5 First, as mentioned 
in the introduction, psychosocial stressors due to socioeconomic 
hardships may strengthen cognitive biases and the automatic 
processes of affective decision making. Observational and inter-
ventional studies of impoverished Indian farmers suggest that 
poverty directly impedes cognitive ability, which prevents those 
of lower SES from making rational decisions (in this case, buying 
fertilisers).23 In our study, socially stressed persons may irratio-
nally choose to pay for health check-up services regardless of 
their actual interests in health-maintaining behaviours, as they 
are simply attracted to the sexy costumed women. Alternatively, 
positive emotions such as happiness, pride, relief, hope, and 
surprise may enhance cognitive capacity and promote reflective 
decision making.24 In this study, positive environmental moods 
created by the costumed women may support pachinko players 
to understand the importance of health-improving behaviours, 
leading to the rational choice of obtaining a check-up.

In either case, the cue triggering the pachinko players’ action 
towards using the health check-up service was the solicitation 
by young women wearing sexually attractive nurse costumes. 
People are more likely to pay attention to targets of their sexual 
interest.11 According to recent neuroscientific studies, compared 
with women, men are more likely to have their cognitive ability 
influenced by women.25 Another study found that a picture of 
attractive women on an advertising letter promoting bank loans 
increased men’s attention by 25% compared with a letter with a 
picture of a reliable male agent.26 Therefore, we initially thought 
that the intervention sessions would be more powerful with male 
participants than their female counterparts.
However, the results of this study did not support this, showing 
potentially stronger effects for socially vulnerable people in the

intervention sessions among women. We propose three possible 
explanations for this. First, the interventions by costumed 
women might have induced specific emotions that affected 
women more than men concerning improving decision-making 
pathways (eg, risk perception and communication, valuation 
and reward seeking and interpersonal attribution).5 However, 
evidence is scant on such sex-gap mechanisms.27–29 Second, 
nurse costumes might have increased the trustworthiness of the 
health check-up services via psychological halo effects. In other 
words, customers’ overall impressions of the service agency or 
brand influenced their thoughts about the services provided by 
the agency. This might have occurred more among females than 
males. A study of college roommates suggested a stronger social 
contagion of mental illness (ie, being depressed influenced by 
roommates’ depression) among women than men.30 Third, staff 
preferences for soliciting men or women might have varied, 
leading to unbalanced effects of customer gender. For example, 
in the intervention sessions, the costumed women might have 
solicited more women than men because it was less mentally 
taxing to talk to same-sex individuals. Meanwhile, there could 
have been male staffs who were popular among potential female 
customers. We knew of the existence of a few such male staffs in 
our conversations with a staff of the company. However, there 
were no clear indications that they would have been more likely 
to be on duty during the intervention sessions.
This study has some limitations. First, we did not have denom-
inator data. Although we evaluated the share of each socioeco-
nomic groups among the persons using the services, ideally, we 
would have calculated between-group differences in the preva-
lence of service utilisation. To calculate this, the data of all people 
who visited the pachinko parlours in each session are necessary. 
Because of this, our study design is specifically vulnerable to the 
overall variations in the sociodemographic backgrounds across 
the customers of all pachinko parlours. However, in most cases, 
each parlour had both intervention and control sessions and 
our statistical approach accounted for parlour variability, mini-
mising the impact of this denominator bias. Second, this was 
not a genuine, cluster randomised trial; therefore, the results are 
threatened by selection bias between the sessions with or without 
costumed women. However, in our interviews with workers 
at the company (the company providing the health check-up 
service), we did not find major sources of bias that could have 
affected the selection of sessions that involved costumed women. 
The company used external staffing services per the availability 
of those services as well as their own employees for solicita-
tion. One potential uncontrolled source of bias is the variability 
in the number of staffs in a session. Sessions with more staffs 
might have been more successful for attracting customers with 
low SES. Moreover, if some external staffs were extremely skilled 
in getting customers who are socioeconomically vulnerable, the 
existence of such external staffs could have been a source of 
bias. Although we did not have data for the number of staffs in 
a session or the existence of highly skilled external staffs, given 
the rationale of using external staff services, we think the number 
of staffs could have been balanced between the intervention 
and control sessions. We also interviewed the company staffs, 
but they did not recall any such ‘superstar’ staffs among either 
the company staffs or the staffs from external staffing compa-
nies. Third, available covariates are limited, potentially leading 
to residual confounding and limited considerations for mecha-
nisms. For example, future studies should gather more accurate 
sociodemographic information about customers such as income, 
educational attainment, social stressors, time preference, risk atti-
tudes and so on.
We should acknowledge two potential criticisms of this 
research. First, this ‘sexy strategy’ could be harmful because it is 
addictive. Like other addictive unhealthy behaviours, including 
smoking and gambling, unnecessary repeating of health check-up 
services increases users’ financial burden. This could be more 
serious among the socially disadvantaged because many of them 
already have financial burdens due to other addictions (eg, 
pachinko). Second, this strategy could be applied for health-
harmful commercial services; for instance, selling ineffective 
‘functional’ foods. Ethical discussions are critical to use erotic 
stimuli and other essential drivers of human behaviour. In this 
study, the trigger was young women wearing mildly erotic nurse 
costumes; however, alternative tools could be used and should 
be investigated in the future in various intervention settings.
This study has important implications for public health and 
applied behaviour sciences. A direct implication is that while 
offering health check-up opportunities equipped with ‘tricks’ 
that nudge people to act could be effective for anyone, they 
might be more valuable for socially vulnerable individuals. 
In public health theory, this is consistent with the concept of 
proportionate universalisms for tackling health disparity, 
positing that ‘actions must be universal, but with a scale and 
intensity that is proportionate to the level of disadvantage’ (p. 
15).31 We do not broadly recommend using mild sexual stimulus 
as an alternative measure to promote health equity. Rather, this 
research should be regarded a case study that investigated using 
the ‘nudge’ concept to address health disparity issues. We recom-
mend that public health interventions aiming to tackle health 
disparities should give more consideration to the proper use of 
recent concepts and evidence from applied behaviour sciences.
What is already known on this subject
 
► Mental stress due to social vulnerability induces affective and 
hedonic behaviour choices that often link to health risks.
 
► We hypothesise that affective but safe stimuli nudging 
people towards preventive actions may reduce health 
disparities.
 
► Mild sexual attraction could provide such stimuli.
What does this study add
 
► Health check-up sessions with women wearing mildly erotic 
nurse costumes gathered more socially vulnerable people 
than ordinary sessions.
 
► Using techniques related to affective responses could be an 
alternative measure for promoting health equity.

research report
Ethics approval In all service sessions, the health check-up service company 
informed customers about the potential utilisation of the data obtained from their 
services for academic research. The company has regularly required customers 
to submit this data-use agreement before providing services. We obtained data 
from individuals who provided written informed consent. Individual identification, 
including names and addresses, was removed before the data were sent to us.
