Summary
Background Little is known about the relative incidence of fatal and non-fatal self-harm in young people. We estimated 
the incidence of suicide, hospital-presenting non-fatal self-harm, and community-occurring non-fatal self-harm in 
adolescents in England.
Methods We used national mortality statistics (Jan 1, 2011, to Dec 31, 2013), hospital monitoring data for five hospitals 
derived from the Multicentre Study of Self-Harm in England (Jan 1, 2011, to Dec 31, 2013), and data from a schools 
survey (2015) to estimate the incidence of fatal and non-fatal self-harm per 100 000 person-years in adolescents aged 
12–17 years in England. We described these incidences in terms of an iceberg model of self-harm.
Findings During 2011–13, 171 adolescents aged 12–17 years died by suicide in England (119 [70%] male and 
133 [78%] aged 15–17 years) and 1320 adolescents presented to the study hospitals following non-fatal self-harm 
(1028 [78%] female and 977 [74%] aged 15–17 years). In 2015, 322 (6%) of 5506 adolescents surveyed reported 
self-harm in the past year in the community (250 [78%] female and 164 [51%] aged 15–17 years). In 12–14 year olds, for 
every boy who died by suicide, 109 attended hospital following self-harm and 3067 reported self-harm in the 
community, whereas for every girl who died by suicide, 1255 attended hospital for self-harm and 21 995 reported 
self-harm in the community. In 15–17 year olds, for every male suicide, 120 males presented to hospital with self-
harm and 838 self-harmed in the community; whereas for every female suicide, 919 females presented to hospital for 
self-harm and 6406 self-harmed in the community. Hanging or asphyxiation was the most common method of suicide 
(125 [73%] of 171), self-poisoning was the main reason for presenting to hospital after self-harm (849 [71%] of 1195), 
and self-cutting was the main method of self-harm used in the community (286 [89%] of 322).
Interpretation Ratios of fatal to non-fatal rates of self-harm differed between males and females and between 
adolescents aged 12–14 years and 15–17 years, with a particularly large number of females reporting self-harm in the 
community. Our findings emphasise the need for well resourced community and hospital-based mental health 
services for adolescents, with greater investment in school-based prevention.

Introduction
Suicide and non-fatal self-harm in adolescents are major 
public health concerns. Self-harm is common in 
adolescents, particularly in females and from the age of 
12 years onwards,1,2 and suicide is a leading cause of 
death in this age group.3 Furthermore, self-harm is the 
strongest risk factor for suicide in children and 
adolescents.1
One report suggests that in 2014–15, 316 people aged 
10–19 years died by suicide in England and Wales.4 Few 
data are available on the incidence of non-fatal 
hospital-presenting self-harm in England, especially in 
adolescents. However, reports from the Multicentre 
Study of Self-harm in England (2000–07) showed that the 
annual incidence of hospital-presenting self-harm was 
67 per 100 000 in boys and 466 per 100 000 in girls aged 
10–14 years, and 302 per 100 000 in males and 1423 per 
100 000 in females aged 15–18 years.5,6 Data on non-fatal 
self-harm in adolescents in the community are also 
scarce. Previous studies, including two school-based 
surveys and a birth cohort in England including 
13–18-year-old adolescents, showed that 6·9–11·0% of 
respondents had reported an act of self-harm in the year 
before the study.7–9
The incidence of self-harm in adolescents can be 
conceptualised in terms of an iceberg model10,11 with 
three levels: fatal self-harm (ie, suicide), which is an overt 
but uncommon behaviour (the tip of the iceberg); 
self-harm that results in presentation to clinical services, 
especially general hospitals, which is also overt, but 
common; and self-harm that occurs in the community, 
which is common but largely hidden (the submerged 
part of the iceberg). The iceberg model is useful for 
clinicians, researchers, and policy makers because it

conveys the hierarchical yet dynamic nature of self-harm. 
Establishing the relative incidence of self-harm at these 
three levels is important to understand the extent of the 
problem and to identify the challenges for prevention 
and intervention.
The overall aim of this study was to describe the extent 
of fatal and non-fatal self-harm in adolescents in England 
in terms of the three levels of the iceberg model, together 
with the methods of self-harm predominantly used at 
each level of the iceberg.
Methods
Study design and population
For this retrospective analysis, we analysed mortality 
statistics, hospital monitoring data, and schools survey 
data for adolescents aged 12–17 years in England. 
Information about deaths by suicide in England was 
obtained from the Office for National Statistics (ONS) by 
year of registration, single year of age, and sex. All deaths 
with a coroner’s verdict of suicide (ICD-10 codes 
X60–X84) or undetermined intent (ICD-10 codes 
Y10–Y34) registered between Jan 1, 2011, and Dec 31, 2013, 
were included. These deaths are henceforth referred to as 
suicides, as per national policy.12–14 Mid-year population 
estimates for England were provided by ONS by sex, 
calendar year, and single year of age.15
Data on hospital-presenting self-harm were derived 
from the Multicentre Study of Self-Harm in England; in 
this ongoing study, data are collected on all presentations 
following self-harm to the emergency department in five 
general hospitals in Manchester (three hospitals), Derby 
(one hospital), and Oxford (one hospital).16,17 Demographic 
and clinical data, including method of self-harm, are 
collected through completion of psychosocial assessments 
by liaison psychiatry services in the general hospital (also 
by emergency department staff in Manchester). People 
who present to hospital but do not receive a psychosocial 
assessment are identified through scrutiny of emergency 
department electronic databases by trained staff, who 
extract less complete data from case records. 
Self-harm is defined as any act of intentional 
self-poisoning or self-injury irrespective of the degree of 
suicidal intent or other motivation.18 In this analysis, we 
included the first presentation by each individual per 
year between Jan 1, 2011, and Dec 31, 2013. We included 
adolescents who resided in the catchment area of the city 
of Manchester, Derby unitary area, or Oxford extended 
area (Oxford city and an additional 64 statistical wards 
Research in context
Evidence before this study
In adolescents, non-fatal self-harm is a common reason for 
hospital presentation and also occurs frequently in the 
community without coming to clinical attention. Suicide is a 
leading cause of death in adolescents and is often preceded by 
self-harm. However, little is known about the relative sizes of the 
populations of adolescents involved in these three levels of 
self-harm, despite the major implications such information could 
have for prevention and clinical management. We searched 
PubMed up to June 30, 2017, with the terms “suicide”, 
“self-harm”, “self-injury”, “self-poisoning”, “suicide attempt”, 
“attempted suicide”, “iceberg”, “relative”, “incidence”, “rates”, 
“adolescents”, “adolescence”, and “young”. We did not apply any 
language restrictions. Although several studies have addressed 
the incidence of each type of self-harm (suicide, hospital-
presenting self-harm, and community-occurring self-harm), to 
our knowledge only one study has addressed the relative 
incidence of all three forms of self-harm. In a study published in 
2014, McMahon and colleagues estimated the relative incidence 
of fatal and non-fatal self-harm in older adolescents (15–17 years) 
in Ireland and described these in terms of the three levels of an 
iceberg model. Their study showed that for every adolescent who 
died by suicide, 34 adolescents presented to the hospital for 
non-fatal self-harm and 555 adolescents reported self-harm in 
the community. The differences between incidences of fatal and 
non-fatal self-harm were particularly marked in females. 
Added value of this study
We used national data on suicide, together with data on hospital-
presenting self-harm from five hospitals from three research 
centres and data on self-harm in the community from a 
large-scale schools survey to calculate the relative incidence of 
fatal and non-fatal self-harm in adolescents aged 12–17 years in 
England. Estimated rates of fatal and non-fatal self-harm show 
that for every adolescent suicide, there are approximately 
370 adolescents who present to hospital for self-harm and 
3900 adolescents who report self-harm in the community. 
Consistent with previous research, our results show substantially 
higher incidences of both hospital-presenting and community-
occurring non-fatal self-harm (which mostly does not come to 
the attention of clinical services) in females than in males. Our 
findings also show substantial differences in methods of 
self-harm between the three levels of the iceberg model, with 
hanging or asphyxiation the most common method of suicide, 
self-poisoning the main method used in hospital-presenting 
self-harm, and self-cutting the most common method of 
self-harm in the community.
Implications of all the available evidence
Taken together, our results and previous findings show the 
extent of fatal and non-fatal self-harm in adolescents, 
highlighting the sizeable problem of community-occurring 
self-harm, especially in females, but also that most self-harm, 
especially in young adolescents, does not come to the attention 
of clinical services. These data emphasise the need for preventive 
measures at the community level, especially through 
school-based programmes, and for well developed treatment 
services to meet the needs of those presenting to clinical services 
following self-harm.

from which at least 90% of emergency hospital 
admissions are to the general hospital in Oxford). Mid-
year population estimates for England were obtained 
from ONS by sex, calendar year, single year of age, and 
local authority.15
Information about self-harm in the community was 
obtained from a web-based survey done within the county 
of Gloucestershire as part of the Emotional Health and 
Well-Being Survey, 2015.19 All secondary state schools and 
other educational settings including sixth forms (ages 
16–18 years), free schools, special schools (for pupils with 
special educational needs), alternative learning centres 
(pupil referral units), and senior independent schools in 
Gloucestershire were invited to take part (43 schools) and 
29 schools (67%) opted in. All pupils in year 8 (aged 
12–13 years), year 10 (aged 14–15 years), and year 12 (aged 
16–17 years) in participating schools were invited to 
complete the survey. Of 5584 pupils eligible to participate 
in the survey, 5520 were in the required age range for our 
study (12–17 years), of whom 2814 (51%) were female and 
2706 (49%) were male.
The survey consisted of a detailed questionnaire about 
self-harm (see appendix). Pupils who reported self-harm 
in the past year (items 1b and 1d) had their free-text 
(item 1e) descriptions of the methods of self-harm (if 
they gave a response) independently reviewed by 
two researchers (GG and KCM) to determine whether 
they met the study criteria,9 as developed for the Child 
and Adolescent Self-harm in Europe study.20 The criteria 
are available on request. Differences in classification 
were reconciled through discussion with a senior 
investigator (KH).
The proportion of pupils eligible for free school meals 
was used as a proxy measure of deprivation and 
compared with national figures to assess the extent to 
which the sample was representative of 12–17 year olds 
in England.
Finally, we obtained information on lifetime prevalence 
of self-harm in the school survey in 2014, which was the 
closest year available to 2011–13, on which we based our 
calculation of incidence of suicide and hospital-presenting 
non-fatal self-harm, and compared it with the figure from 
the 2015 survey to assess stability of the findings. 
Approval from ONS was obtained in the format of a 
microdata agreement. ONS provided anonymised data at 
the individual level. For the Multicentre Study of Self-harm 
in England, the monitoring systems in Oxford and Derby 
have received approval from national health research 
ethics committees to collect data on self-harm. Self-harm 
monitoring in Manchester is part of a local clinical audit 
system ratified by the local research ethics committee. All 
three monitoring systems are fully compliant with the 
Data Protection Act (1998) and have approval under 
Section 251 of the National Health Service (NHS) Act 
(2006) to collect patient-identifiable information without 
patient consent. The leaders of the Emotional Health and 
Well-Being Survey (PF and KP) obtained approval for the 
survey from participating schools. Pupils were able to opt 
out. Data for the study were obtained in an anonymised 
format. No further ethical approval was sought for use of 
the school-based survey data for this analysis following 
advice from the University of Oxford’s clinical trials and 
research governance team that use of anonymised 
secondary data not originating in the NHS does not 
require ethical approval.21
Data analysis
We calculated the incidence of suicide, hospital-presenting 
non-fatal self-harm, and community-occurring non-fatal 
self-harm per 100 000 person-years using Poisson 
distribution with exact 95% CIs. Analyses were run by 
sex and age group (12–14 years and 15–17 years). We used 
Poisson regression models to compare rates of self-harm 
between males and females and between adolescents 
aged 12–14 years and 15–17 years. Negative binomial 
regression models were used if there was evidence of 
over-dispersion as indicated by the Pearson goodness-of-
fit test.
Rates of death by suicide were calculated from the 
number of deaths by suicide and mid-year population 
estimates for the equivalent period in England. Rates of 
hospital-presenting self-harm were calculated from the 
number of individuals presenting to the participating

hospitals who resided in the defined catchment areas 
and the mid-year population estimates for these areas. 
For each individual we used the first presentation to 
hospital for self-harm within each year (2011, 2012, and 
2013). Rates of community-occurring self-harm were 
calculated from the number of pupils reporting self-harm 
in the past year (with a valid method described) and the 
population of pupils who participated in the survey.
We calculated the proportion of individuals using 
different methods of self-harm: self-poisoning, self-injury 
(cutting or stabbing, hanging or asphyxiation, and all 
other self-injury methods), within the different levels of 
the iceberg model. We also assessed the overlap between 
hospital-presenting and community-occurring self-harm 
and characterised these individuals in terms of sex, age, 
and self-harm method. We did all analyses with Stata 
version 14.1.
Role of the funding source
The Multicentre Study of Self-harm in England is funded 
by the UK Department of Health, which had no role in 
study design, data collection, data analysis, data 
interpretation, or writing of the report. The corresponding 
author had full access to all the data in the study and had 
final responsibility for the decision to submit for 
publication.
Results
During 2011–13, there were 171 registered suicides in 
adolescents aged 12–17 years in England: 119 in males 
and 52 in females (ie, 57 suicides per year: 40 in males 
and 17 in females; table). During the same period, 
1320 adolescents aged 12–17 years (292 males and 
1028 females) presented to the five general hospitals in 
the Multicentre Study of Self-harm in England following 
self-harm (ie, 440 adolescents per year: 97 males and 
343 females).
Of the 5520 pupils aged 12–17 years who entered the 
schools survey in 2015, 14 were excluded because their 
sex was not recorded, resulting in 5506 eligible 
adolescents. Overall, 660 (12%) of 5506 pupils reported 
self-harm in the year before the survey, of whom 
433 (66%) provided a description of the method used. 
Data for 322 (6%) of 5506 pupils who described a method 
of self-harm that met the study criteria were used in the 
analyses (250 females and 72 males).
Figure 1 shows the incidence of suicides, hospital-
presenting self-harm, and community-occurring self-
harm according to the different compartments of the 
iceberg model. The incidence of suicide in adolescents 
aged 12–17 years was 1·5 per 100 000 person-years, and 
the incidences of hospital-presenting and community-
occurring self-harm were 556 per 100 000 person-years 
and 5848 per 100 000 person-years, respectively (table). In 
adolescents aged 12–14 years, the incidence of suicide in 
boys was more than double that in girls (incidence rate 
ratio [IRR] 2·07, 95% CI 1·04–4·09, p=0·038), and the 
incidence of non-fatal self-harm was substantially greater 
in girls than in boys (hospital-presenting self-harm: 
IRR 5·12, 2·51–10·42, p<0·0001; community-occurring 
self-harm: IRR 3·19, 2·19–4·64, p<0·0001).
In adolescents aged 15–17 years, the incidence of 
suicide in males was more than twice that in females 
(IRR 2·20, 95% CI 1·28–3·79, p=0·004). The incidence 
of non-fatal self-harm was more than three times greater 
in females than in males (hospital-presenting self-harm: 
IRR 3·47, 2·99–4·02, p<0·0001; community-occurring 
self-harm: IRR 3·45, 2·39–4·99, p<0·0001). The incidence 
of community-occurring self-harm in adolescents aged 
15–17 years was similar to that in those aged 12–14 years 
in both males and females (males: IRR 0·94, 0·59–1·49, 
p=0·80; females: IRR 1·02, 0·80–1·31, p=0·88), whereas 
the incidence of suicide was more than three times 
higher in adolescents aged 15–17 years than in those aged 
12–14 years in both males (IRR 3·40, 1·85–6·23, 
p<0·0001) and females (IRR 3·19, 1·67–6·08, p<0·0001). 
However, incidence of hospital-presenting non-fatal 
self-harm was more than two times higher in females 
aged 15–17 years than in females aged 12–14 years 
(IRR 2·57, 2·24–2·94, p<0·0001) and nearly four times 
greater in males aged 15–17 years than in males aged 
12–14 years (IRR 3·80, 2·46–5·86, p<0·0001).
On the basis of the estimated incidences of fatal and 
non-fatal self-harm, in adolescents aged 12–14 years, for 
Figure 1: Incidence of fatal and non-fatal self-harm per 100 000 person-years by age group and sex
(A) Age 12–14 years. Rate ratio of suicide to hospital self-harm and to community self-harm: 1:109:3067 for males

1:7 for females. The horizontal line represents the division between overt behaviour (suicide and hospital-
presenting self-harm) and covert behaviour (non-fatal self-harm occurring in the community, which often does 
not come to the attention of clinical services).

suicide, 
approximately 
100 presented to hospital following self-harm and 
3000 reported self-harm in the community. For every girl 
who died by suicide, approximately 1200 presented to 
hospital following self-harm and 22 000 reported 
self-harm in the community (figure 1).
In adolescents aged 15–17 years, for every male suicide, 
about 120 males presented to the hospital following 
self-harm and around 800 reported self-harm in the 
community, whereas in females, for every suicide, 
approximately 900 presented to hospital with self-harm 
and 6400 self-harmed in the community.
The most common method of suicide was hanging or 
asphyxiation (figure 2). Most adolescents presenting to 
hospital following self-harm did so after self-poisoning. 
A substantial proportion also presented after self-cutting. 
Most pupils who reported self-harm in the community 
had used self-cutting.
28 (9%) of the 322 participants of the schools survey who 
reported self-harm in the year before the survey presented 
to hospital for self-harm; six (4%) of 158 pupils aged 
12–14 years and 22 (13%) of 164 pupils aged 15–17 years. 
Most adolescents presenting to hospital were female (n=27 
[96%]), aged 15–17 years (n=22 [79%]), and had self-
poisoned (n=22 [79%]).
To take account of this overlap between community-
occurring and hospital-presenting self-harm, we also 
calculated the incidence of self-harm in pupils who had 
not presented to hospital as a result of their self-harm 
(n=294). In 12–14 year olds, the incidence was 2760 per 
100 000

males 
and

100 000 person-years in females; in 15–17 year olds, the 
incidence was 2528 per 100 000 person-years in males 
and 7486 per 100 000 person-years in females.
Information provided by 26 of the 29 participating 
schools indicated that 612 (8%) of 7620 pupils in years 
8 and 10 were eligible for free school meals in 2015 (free 
school meals are not available in year 12) compared with 
14% of pupils in state-funded secondary schools in 
England in 2015.22
With regard to lifetime prevalence of self-harm, we 
found that 985 (18·1%) of 5428 pupils who entered the 
2014 survey reported having ever self-harmed compared 
with 2388 (18·2%) of 13 090 in the 2015 survey, indicating 
that the proportions of lifetime self-harm in the school 
surveys were stable. 
Discussion
We estimated the relative incidences of fatal and non-fatal 
self-harm in adolescents in England and described these 
in terms of the three levels of the iceberg model of 
self-harm.10,11 Our results highlight differences in the 
ratios of fatal to non-fatal self-harm in males and females, 
with higher incidence of suicide in males than in females 
and higher incidence of self-harm in females than in 
males. The incidence of hospital-presenting non-fatal 
self-harm differed greatly between younger and older 
adolescents, but the incidence of self-harm in the 
community did not differ substantially between the 
two age groups in either males or females. Substantial 
differences in methods of self-harm were evident at 
different levels of the iceberg model, with hanging or 
asphyxiation the most common method of suicide, 
self-poisoning the most frequent method of self-harm in 
adolescents presenting to hospital, and self-cutting the 
main method of self-harm in the community.
Extrapolation from the estimated incidences of fatal 
and non-fatal self-harm in our study to the population of 
England suggests that every year, about 21 000 adolescents 
aged 12–17 years present to hospital following self-harm 
and 200 000 self-harm in the community and do not 
present to hospital. The latter estimation does not take

account of pupils who reported self-harm in the 
community and also presented to hospital for self-harm. 
However, this number could also be a considerable 
underestimate.
In a study of adolescents aged 15–17 years in Ireland, 
McMahon and colleagues11 reported that the annual 
incidence of suicide was 16·5 per 100 000 in males and 
2·7 per 100 000 in females, a male-to-female ratio of 6:1, 
compared with the ratio of 2:1 in our study. However, the 
investigators reported lower rates of hospital-presenting 
self-harm than seen in our study. The difference is 
especially notable for females, with a three-times higher 
incidence of hospital-presenting self-harm in our study 
than in the Irish study (1287·35 [95% CI 1196·50–1383·28] 
vs 438·1 [320·30–555·96] per 100 000 person-years). As 
noted by McMahon and colleagues, the Multicentre 
Study of Self-harm in England is focused primarily on 
urban populations, in which self-harm rates are known 
to be somewhat higher than in rural areas,23 whereas the 
Irish study was based on predominantly rural 
populations.11 Differences between rural and urban 
populations in terms of access to hospitals, which is 
more limited in rural settings, might also have 
contributed to the difference in incidence. Furthermore, 
in Ireland most people attending emergency departments 
(including young people) are charged for their visit, 
which could discourage attendance. Nevertheless, 
community incidence rates of self-harm in the Irish 
study were remarkably similar to those in our study. 
Notably, a large study of 15–16-year-old pupils in schools 
in Oxfordshire, Northamptonshire, and Birmingham 
during 2000–01 identified somewhat higher community 
rates than in our study, of 3184 per 100 000 per year in 
males and 11 062 per 100 000 in females,9 possibly 
because the focus of that study was on schools in urban 
areas and differences in socioeconomic deprivation24 
between the study areas. Furthermore, in our study, 
9% of pupils presented to hospital following an episode 
of self-harm, compared with 6% in the Irish study11 and 
13% in the earlier survey in England.9
Our study has some limitations. Despite the inclusion 
of the ICD-10 codes of death due to undetermined intent, 
there might have been substantial under-identification of 
suicides by coroners, especially for deaths involving self-
poisoning, where potential suicides are often assigned a 
verdict of accidental death.25,26 Also, pupils in the schools 
survey might have under-reported self-harm because of 
embarrassment and stigma that might be associated with 
mental health problems, although the survey was 
completed anonymously. Furthermore, in the schools 
survey we only included individuals who described a 
method of self-harm meeting our criteria, so our 
estimates of incidence of community-occurring self-harm 
in the past year are conservative. Nevertheless, the 
findings from this study are in keeping with findings 
from earlier studies, including a survey in England9 and a 
study in Ireland,27 all of which used similar methods 
(self-harm 
in 
the 
past 
year: 
6%, 
6·9%, 
and 
5·7%, respectively).
The estimated incidences of hospital-based and 
community-occurring non-fatal self-harm should be 
treated with caution because they were based on data 
from specific geographical areas. Information about 
hospital-presenting self-harm was based on data from 
three research centres comprising five hospitals and 
might not be representative of England as a whole, 
although these centres have socioeconomically diverse 
populations. The sample used to estimate the community 
level of self-harm might have been of higher 
socioeconomic status than the general population of 
adolescents in England; socioeconomic position is 
inversely associated with self-harm.24 The proportion of 
pupils eligible for free school meals (8%) was lower in 
the schools survey than the equivalent proportion in 
England (14%). Furthermore, on the basis of the Index of 
Multiple Deprivation, the county of Gloucestershire is of 
average or above average socioeconomic position relative 
to the rest of the country. Our estimated school-based 
incidences of self-harm might therefore underestimate 
the true incidence of non-fatal self-harm in the 
community, although findings from other similar 
studies9,11 are consistent with our results. Furthermore, 
most school pupils who reported self-harm in the past 
year and presented to hospital used self-poisoning (79%), 
a proportion consistent with that from the Multicentre 
Study of Self-harm in England (71%). Finally, estimates 
of community-occurring self-harm were based on data 
from 2015, whereas estimates of suicides and hospital-
presenting self-harm were based on data from 2011 to 
2013. 
Our findings highlight the population burden of fatal 
and non-fatal self-harm in adolescents and underline the 
need for preventive and therapeutic measures at different 
levels of the iceberg model. Suicide is fairly rare in 
adolescents but is always a possibility, especially in those 
who self-harm.1 It has devastating effects on family,28,29 
friends, 
fellow 
students 
and 
school 
staff, 
and 
communities. Our findings emphasise the need for 
effective suicide prevention initiatives for this age group 
and for appropriate and accessible support for those who 
are coping with the death of a young person by suicide.
The extent of hospital-presenting self-harm highlights 
the need for easily accessible community mental health 
services 
for 
young 
people 
and 
well 
resourced 
hospital-based services that can provide a comprehensive 
psychosocial assessment,30 followed when appropriate by 
referral to further care, preferably including psychosocial 
treatment.31,32 Self-harm in adolescents in the community 
is very common, especially in females. Several 
school-based programmes addressing prevention of 
self-harm in adolescence have been developed and 
assessed in recent years, including Saving and 
Empowering Young Lives in Europe,33 and the Good 
Behaviour Game,34,35 with some evidence of beneficial

effects. A further approach involves school-based 
screening,36 although such interventions have not 
generally been adopted. Interventions might also be 
provided 
through 
online 
and 
mobile 
telephone 
applications, although currently there is little evidence of 
their effectiveness in adolescents.37–39 Self-harm by 
adolescents often has a major impact on families, 
including stress, anxiety, and financial difficulties.40,41 
Therefore, family members themselves often need 
support.41
In conclusion, our findings support recent calls for 
improved community-based mental health services for 
young people,42 along with well resourced hospital 
services and the implementation of evidence-based 
prevention programmes in schools.
