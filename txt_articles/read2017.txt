BACKGROUND: auscultation for bowel sounds has been 
advocated by some clinicians as a method to determine 
the resolution of postoperative ileus.
OBJECTIVE: our primary aim was to prospectively 
evaluate the relationships between bowel sounds and 
the ability to tolerate oral intake in patients after major 
abdominal surgery. secondarily we aimed to evaluate 
relationships among bowel sounds, flatus and bowel 
movement, and oral intake.
DESIGN: this was a prospective, blinded observational study.
SETTINGS: the study was conducted at Western 
Pennsylvania hospital.
PATIENTS: a total of 124 adult patients undergoing 
major abdominal surgery were included.
MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Data were collected by 
medical students blinded to the purpose of the study for 
10 days postoperatively or until discharge, including the 
presence of bowel sounds (auscultation for 1 minute), flatus, 
bowel movement, and tolerance of oral intake (defined 
as ingestion of ≥1000 ml/24 h and each subsequent day 
without vomiting). associations between paired variables 
were determined using ϕ coefficient testing.
RESULTS: the study population consisted of 51 men and 
73 women, with a mean age of 64 years (range, 20–92 y). 
the majority of patients (78/124 (63%)) underwent 
colorectal resection. the median length of hospital was 6 
days. Bowel sounds were not associated with flatus, bowel 
movement, or tolerance of oral intake throughout the study 
period. the positive predictive value of bowel sounds in 
predicting flatus and bowel movement was low in the early 
postoperative period and remained <25% in predicting 
tolerance of oral intake throughout the study period. 
the analysis was repeated, including only those patients 
undergoing colorectal procedures, and was essentially 
unchanged. flatus correlated with bowel movement in 
the first 6 days postoperation, but neither flatus nor bowel 
movement was associated with tolerance of oral intake.
LIMITATIONS: the rate of tolerance of oral intake was 
relatively modest throughout the study period.
CONCLUSIONS: Bowel sounds are not associated with 
flatus, bowel movement, or tolerance of oral intake after 
major abdominal surgery.

used as an end point of postoperative ileus and a cue to 
institute oral feeding, despite the fact that inhibition of co-
ordinated peristaltic activity in different areas of the gut is 
of varying duration.2
flatus and bowel movement have also been used as 
drivers of postoperative feeding, as well as primary out-
come variables in studies of the resolution of postopera-
tive ileus,3 despite the fact that they may be nonspecific, 
representing distal intestinal evacuation rather than global 
coordinated Gi tract function. in addition, the concept of 
diet tolerance has not been standardized in studies of the 
postoperative ileus,4 leaving readers uncertain as to the 
amount of oral intake consumed by study patients and 
whether intravenous fluid supplementation could be dis-
continued when they are determined to have tolerated a 
diet.
the aim of this study was to prospectively evaluate the 
relationships among bowel sounds, flatus, bowel move-
ment, and ability to tolerate oral intake in patients after 
major abdominal surgery. We used a quantitative defini-
tion of tolerance of diet, one that presumably would allow 
for discontinuation of intravenous fluid supplementation 
if the patient was doing well otherwise.
PATIENTS AND METHODS
a prospective, blinded observational study was under-
taken in 124 consecutive adult patients undergoing major 
abdominal surgery for Gi or aortic pathology, either by 
laparotomy or laparoscopic approach, both elective and 
emergent, at the Western Pennsylvania hospital. Western 
Pennsylvania hospital institutional Review Board ap-
proval was obtained for the study. Patient consent was not 
required by the institutional review board, because data 
were deidentified and the data collected were deemed to be 
part of usual clinical care. third- and fourth-year medical 
students from temple university school of medicine do-
ing their surgical rotations at the hospital, blinded to the 
purpose of the study, collected data after operation. Data 
were censored after postoperative day 10 or on the day of 
discharge from the hospital, whichever occurred first.
temple university medical students were instructed 
to examine the patients for bowel sounds and to collect 
data from the medical chart, ostensibly as a part of routine 
practice after operation. students were instructed to deter-
mine the presence or absence of bowel sounds by auscul-
tation in 4 quadrants of the abdomen with a stethoscope 
for 1 minute total. any detection of borborygmi during 
the auscultation period was coded as positive. flatus and 
bowel movements over the previous 24 hours were deter-
mined by query of the patients, supplemented by review of 
nursing documentation. medical students were instructed 
to review the nursing records and to use those notes as a 
query tool when interviewing the patient. however, flatus 
and bowel movement data were recorded based on patient 
recollection.
oral intake was determined by review of the nurs-
ing documentation. tolerance of diet was defined as in-
take of ≥1000 ml/24 hours without vomiting and intake 
of ≥1000 ml/24 hours on successive days without vom-
iting. We chose this amount because it seemed to be a 
reasonable measure of whether a patient could hydrate 
without intravenous fluid supplementation (equivalent to 
42 ml/h of intravenous fluid supplementation over 24 h). 
after colorectal resections, per standing order sets, a clear 
liquid diet was offered immediately postoperation, with 
≈1500 ml per day provided on the trays delivered by di-
etary services. otherwise, diet was ordered at the discre-
tion of the attending surgeon.
associations between variables were assessed by calcu-
lating ϕ correlation coefficients. Positive predictive values 
were also calculated. We calculated correlation coefficients 
and positive predictive values daily rather than using a cu-
mulative score, because it was assumed that, with time, all 
of the variables would be positive, because postoperative 
ileus would be expected to resolve in all of the patients.
Sample size calculation was made for the primary 
outcome variables (correlation of bowel sounds with tol-
erance of oral intake) on postoperative day 2, because this 
was estimated to be the time likely to have the greatest flux 
with regard to the variables in question (power (1 – β) = 
0.80; α = 0.05). Because there has been few data published 
on the topic previously, we used the following assump-
tions: 1) sampling ratio n(a)/n(B) = 2.0 (two thirds of pa-
tients would have bowel sounds; one third would not have 
bowel sounds); 2) the proportion of patients with bowel 
sounds who were able to tolerate oral intake was 0.67; and 
3) the proportion of patients without bowel sounds who 
were able to tolerate oral intake was 0.33. Sample size for 
the total group was thus 69.5 P values that were considered 
significant were calculated using the Bonferroni correc-
tion for testing of multiple comparisons, as listed in the 
tables.
RESULTS
Data from 51 men and 73 women, mean age 64 years 
(range, 20–92 y), were obtained. Procedures performed 
included colorectal resection with or without intestinal 
stoma (n = 78 (63%)); exploratory laparotomy, lysis of ad-
hesions, and drainage of intra-abdominal abscess (n = 20 
(16%)); small-bowel resection (n = 10 (8%)); aortic pro-
cedures (n = 7 (6%)); gastroesophageal resection (n = 6 
(4%)); and pancreatic resection (n = 3 (2%)). median 
length of hospital was 6 days (mean = 8 d).
the frequency of bowel sounds, flatus, bowel move-
ment, and tolerance of oral intake over the first 10 post-
operative days is listed in table 1. With the exception

of postoperative day 0, bowel sounds were detected in 
the majority of patients throughout the 10-day postop-
erative period. flatus and bowel movement increased 
in frequency postoperation, as would be expected. the 
fraction of patients with adequate oral intake (defined 
as oral intake of ≥1000 ml/24 h without vomiting and 
intake of ≥1000 ml/24 h on successive days without 
vomiting) was relatively modest throughout the study 
period.
the presence of bowel sounds was not associated with 
flatus or bowel movement for the majority of the postop-
erative period (table 2). Bowel sounds were also not asso-
ciated with tolerance of oral intake throughout the 10-day 
study period. flatus correlated with bowel movement, but 
neither flatus nor bowel movement was associated with 
tolerance of oral intake.
Bowel sounds had low positive predictive value in pre-
dicting flatus (fig. 1) and bowel movement (fig. 2) in the 
early postoperative period. Bowel sounds had low posi-
tive predictive value in predicting tolerance of oral intake 
throughout the study period (fig. 3).
Colorectal Procedures
Because the postoperative diet protocol was not uniformly 
standard for patients undergoing operations other than 
colorectal procedures, we repeated the analysis, includ-
ing only those patients undergoing colorectal procedures. 
the frequency of bowel sounds, flatus, bowel movement, 
and tolerance of oral intake over the first 10 postopera-
tive days is listed in table 3. the results paralleled those of 
the entire study population. We also calculated ϕ correla-
tion coefficients for bowel sounds versus tolerance of oral 
intake (table 4) and found no association between these 
variables throughout the study period.
DISCUSSION
our data demonstrate that bowel sounds are not associ-
ated with flatus, bowel movement, or tolerance of oral 
intake in the first 10 days after major abdominal surgery. 
auscultation for bowel sounds is thus unreliable as a de-
terminant of whether ileus has resolved and unreliable as 
a predictor of whether a patient will tolerate oral feeding 
postoperation.

although little investigation has been performed on 
the exact genesis of bowel sounds, it is reasonable to as-
sume that bowel sounds result from agitation of air/fluid 
interfaces in the gut.6 thus, both coordinated and unco-
ordinated motion of the intestine may generate sound. 
the finding that the presence of bowel sounds had a low 
positive predictive value in predicting tolerance of oral 
intake suggests that bowel sounds may represent unco-
ordinated activity of the Gi tract and/or activity of the 
small bowel without coordinated activity of the stomach. 
the finding that bowel sounds also had poor predictive 
value in predicting flatus and bowel movement in the ear-
ly postoperative period again suggests that bowel sounds 
may represent uncoordinated activity of the Gi tract and/
or activity of the small bowel without coordinated activ-
ity of the colon.
Despite the apparent enthusiasm of some clinicians 
for listening to bowel sounds in the postoperative period 
to determine resolution of the ileus,1 there is a paucity of 
literature on the topic.7 in fact, the majority of the pub-
lished data do not support the practice. massey8 found 
no association between bowel sounds and flatus in a sub-
analysis of data from 66 patients after major abdominal 
surgery in a rocking chair intervention trial of resolution 
of postoperative ileus. Waldhausen et al2 found that, after 
laparotomy, bowel sounds returned on day 2.4 ± 0.5, and 
passage of flatus and stool occurred on day 5.1 ± 0.2, sug-
gesting little association between the 2 variables.

in addition to the lack of data supporting the aus-
cultation of bowel sounds to assess for the resolution of 
postoperative ileus, it is also unclear whether there are dif-
ferent patterns of bowel sounds that reflect pathologic ver-
sus normal states and whether clinicians could recognize 
such patterns reliably, should they exist. felder et al9 stud-
ied whether clinicians could identify differences in bowel 
sounds from healthy individuals and those with patho-
logic conditions. they prospectively collected recordings 
of bowel sounds from healthy volunteers, patients with 
radiographically confirmed small-bowel obstruction, and 
patients with a clinical diagnosis of postoperative ileus. 
the recordings were then played to clinicians blinded to 
the clinical scenario. they found that the overall sensitivity 
for distinguishing between clinical scenarios (22%–32%) 
and positive predictive values (23%–44%) was low.
We also found little correlation between flatus or bow-
el movement and the ability of the patient to tolerate oral 
intake ≥1000 ml/24 hours in the early postoperative pe-
riod. these findings call into question the validity of some 
studies of the resolution of ileus after major abdominal 
surgery, in which investigators used flatus or bowel move-
ment as surrogate markers for the success of treatment. 
however, it should be noted that the fraction of patients 
who met our criteria for tolerance of diet was relatively 
low. the exact reasons for this finding could not be elu-
cidated from the data, but potential reasons include the 
following: 1) patients were discharged before meeting 
our criteria for tolerance of diet; 2) data were censored 
for the day of discharge, which is presumably the day that 
the greatest amount of oral intake would be expected; 3) 
recording of oral intake was inaccurate; or 4) oral intake 
varied day to day, over and under the 1000-ml level, which 
would be coded as negative in our study.
one may ask why these data are important, in the era 
of early feeding and enhanced recovery protocols.10 al-

though it has been demonstrated that there is benefit to 
such programs with minimal risk to the patients, not all 
practitioners have embraced immediate feeding after col-
ectomy. the practice of auscultation for bowel sounds in 
the postoperative patient persists in many environments 
as a guide to postoperative feeding.7
it is unclear as to whether there exists a normal latency 
period between detection of bowel sounds and the presence 
of any of the outcome variables studied (flatus, bowel move-
ment, and tolerance of oral intake). in our study, we chose 
not to analyze our data with any assumptions regarding la-
tency periods between variables for a number of reasons. to 
our knowledge, there are no definitive data as to whether a 
latency period of consistent duration exists between bowel 
sounds and any of the other variables analyzed. Even if we 
assume that there was a latency period, there are no defini-
tive data regarding the duration of such a latency period and 
whether it would be different for different outcome variables. 
lastly, decisions regarding feeding are made in real time, so 
that correlations between current bowel sounds and future 
tolerance of oral intake may not be of clinical relevance.
the strengths of our study are the prospective, blinded 
design and the quantitative definition of tolerance of diet. a 
potential limitation of the work is that the fraction of patients 
meeting our criteria for tolerance of diet was relatively mod-
est, as discussed above. in addition, in a subfraction of patients, 
the surgeon could control the diet and theoretically limit ac-
cess to oral intake arbitrarily. however, the majority of patients 
underwent colorectal resections and were on a postoperative 
pathway that allowed them free access to liquids beginning im-
mediately postoperation. in addition, surgeons were blinded to 
the outcomes of the study, and the noncolorectal surgeons were 
blinded as to the purpose of the study. lastly, the outcomes of 
the subgroup of patients who underwent colorectal resection 
mirrored those of the entire group.
another potential limitation is that the use of mul-
tiple correlations raises the potential for type i error. the 
Bonferroni correction compensates for this potential error 
but also results in a significant p value that is low and can 
be manipulated by censoring the number of correlations 
that are displayed. for this reason, we chose to display the 
correlation coefficients in raw form and to indicate which 
were significant based on a p value generated using the 
Bonferroni correction, as well as those that would be sig-
nificant if they were considered in isolation (p ≤ 0.05).
CONCLUSION
Bowel sounds are not associated with flatus, bowel move-
ment, or the ability to tolerate oral intake in the early post-
operative period after major abdominal surgery. thus, 
bowel sounds should not be used to guide decisions re-
garding feeding nor be used as surrogate markers for reso-
lution of the postoperative ileus.
