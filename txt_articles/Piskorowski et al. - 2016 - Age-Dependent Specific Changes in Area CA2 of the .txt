SUMMARY
Several neuropsychiatric disorders are associated
with cognitive and social dysfunction. Postmortem
studies of patients with schizophrenia have revealed
specific changes in area CA2, a long-overlooked
region of the hippocampus recently found to be
critical for social memory formation. To examine
how area CA2 is altered in psychiatric illness, we
used the Df(16)A+/� mouse model of the 22q11.2
microdeletion, a genetic risk factor for developing
several neuropsychiatric disorders, including schizo-
phrenia. We report several age-dependent CA2 alter-
ations: a decrease in the density of parvalbumin-
expressing interneurons, a reduction in the amount
of feedforward inhibition, and a change in CA2 pyra-
midal-neuron intrinsic properties. Furthermore, we
found that area CA2 is less plastic in Df(16)A+/�
mice, making it nearly impossible to evoke action
potential firing in CA2 pyramidal neurons. Finally,
we show that Df(16)A+/� mice display impaired social
cognition, providing a potential mechanism and a
neural substrate for this impairment in psychiatric
disorders.
INTRODUCTION
While much recent progress has been made in understanding
the genetic causes of psychiatric illnesses, there remain many
unresolved questions pertaining to the neural substrates at the
cellular and circuitry levels underlying specific symptoms and
cognitive deficits. One area in particular that merits further study
is the long-overlooked area CA2 of the hippocampus. It was
shown recently that area CA2 is critical for social memory forma-
tion (Hitti and Siegelbaum, 2014; Stevenson and Caldwell, 2014),
likely plays little role in spatial coding (Lee et al., 2015; Lu et al.,
2015; Mankin et al., 2015), and may serve to detect conflicts
between memory-driven and sensory information converging
on the hippocampus (Wintzer et al., 2014). Before the contribu-
tion of area CA2 to hippocampal function was appreciated,
numerous postmortem studies of schizophrenic and psychotic
patients had revealed that this relatively small hippocampal
region undergoes disease-related changes in size and composi-
tion (Benes et al., 1998; Narr et al., 2004). A meta-analysis study
reported that a decrease in parvalbumin-expressing (PV+) inter-
neuron (IN) density in area CA2 was one of the few measures,
of more than 200, to be significantly altered in schizophrenia
and bipolar disorder in the hippocampus (Knable et al., 2004).
A decrease in PV+ INs in CA2 has also been reported in
Alzheimer’s disease (Brady and Mufson, 1997). Therefore, un-
derstanding cellular alterations that occur in area CA2 in psychi-
atric disorders is likely to provide invaluable information about
the pathogenesis of these diseases. To this end, we analyzed
CA2 in a mouse model of the 22q11.2 deletion syndrome
(22q11.2DS), as this allows a more reliable and comprehensive
examination of the consequences of the disease on cellular func-
tion and circuitry dynamics.
Individuals with the 22q11.2 deletion are sometimes given
other diagnoses early in life, including attention-deficit hyper-
activity
disorder, generalized
anxiety disorder, obsessive-
compulsive disorder, and autism spectrum disorders (ASDs)
(Karayiorgou et al., 2010). In late adolescence and early adult-
hood, up to one-third of all individuals carrying the 22q11.2
deletion develop schizophrenia or schizoaffective disorder, an
approximately 30-fold increase in disease risk. Moreover, de
novo 22q11.2 deletions account for up to 1%–2% of sporadic
schizophrenia cases (International Schizophrenia Consortium,
2008; Karayiorgou et al., 1995; Xu et al., 2008). Most affected
individuals carry a 3 Mb hemizygous deletion, whereas 7%
have a nested 1.5 Mb deletion spanning 27 known genes (Kar-
ayiorgou et al., 2010). A mouse model, Df(16)A+/� mice (Stark
et al., 2008), carrying an engineered orthologous deletion on
mouse chromosome 16 encompassing all but one of the genes
encoded in the 22q11.2 critical region, is a particularly powerful
tool for deciphering how this genetic lesion increases risk for

 neuropsychiatric disorders. Df(16)A+/� mice have deficits in
sensorimotor gating, emotional learning (Stark et al., 2008),
and altered performance and long-range synchrony between
the hippocampus and prefrontal cortex during a spatial work-
ing-memory task (Sigurdsson et al., 2010; Stark et al., 2008).
However, besides the impairment in long-range connectivity
between brain structures, the local cellular changes at the level
of the hippocampal microcircuit are subtle in area CA1 (Drew
et al., 2011; Earls et al., 2010) and completely unknown in areas
CA2 and CA3. Given the reported alterations in area CA2
in patients with schizophrenia and other neuropsychiatric disor-
ders, we decided to examine area CA2 of Df(16)A+/� mice and,
in particular, the inhibitory transmission and activity-dependent
plasticity mediated by PV+ INs.
We found that the density of PV+ INs in the hippocampus of
Df(16)A+/� mice is specifically reduced in area CA2. Accompa-
nying this reduction is an impairment of feedforward inhibition
onto CA2 PNs and a larger excitatory drive from CA3 inputs.
These effects are only observed after maturity to adulthood,
paralleling the disease onset in humans. The intrinsic properties
of CA2 PNs are also affected, resulting in a decreased action po-
tential firing in response to proximal and distal excitatory input
stimulation. The Df(16)A+/� mice display social memory impair-
ment similar to that observed following specific silencing of
CA2 PNs. These results show that the specific alterations re-
ported in hippocampal CA2 in humans with schizophrenia are
also present in Df(16)A+/� mice and may underlie impaired social
cognition in this disorder.
RESULTS
The Density of PV+ INs in the Hippocampus Is Decreased
Specifically in Area CA2 of Adult Df(16)A+/– Mice
In the hippocampus, both individual and meta-analysis of
postmortem studies of individuals with schizophrenia have re-
ported a significant decrease in PV+ IN density specifically in
area CA2 (Benes et al., 1998; Berretta et al., 2009; Knable
et al., 2004; Zhang and Reynolds, 2002). Therefore, we first
asked whether a similar change in PV+ IN density occurred in
area CA2 of Df(16)A+/� mice. To this end, we performed immuno-
staining against PV and quantified the density of PV+ cells in the
different subdivisions of the hippocampus in adult mice (8 weeks
old). Consistent with previous findings (Botcher et al., 2014;
Piskorowski and Chevaleyre, 2013), the density of PV+ INs in
wild-type littermate control mice (WT) was higher in area CA2
stratum oriens (SO) and stratum pyramidale (SP) than in the other
hippocampal areas (Figures 1A and 1B). In Df(16)A+/� mice, the
density of PV+ INs in area CA2 was significantly lower than in WT
mice (results for SO were as follows: 6,650 ± 525 for WT versus
4,691 ± 239 for Df(16)A+/� mice, p = 0.0068; results for SP were
as follows: 24,664 ± 1,307 for WT versus 16,110 ± 2,071 for
Df(16)A+/� mice, p = 0.0058; n = 6 mice for both WT and Df(16)
A+/� mice). Strikingly, this decrease in PV+ cell density was
specific to area CA2, as no changes were observed in areas
CA1 and CA3 (Figure 1B). To ensure that the quantification of
PV+ density in CA2 was not biased by a change in the size of
area CA2 in Df(16)A+/� mice, we also performed costaining
with the CA2-specific marker regulator of G protein signaling
14 (RGS14) (Lee et al., 2010). We found no difference between
WT and Df(16)A+/� mice in the area of the hippocampus stained
by the RGS14 antibody, indicating that the size of area CA2 is
unchanged. Moreover, with the boundaries between the CA
areas defined by RGS14 staining alone, we confirmed the signif-
icant decrease in the density of PV+ cells in CA2 area of Df(16)
A+/� mice (Figure S1, available online; SP results were as fol-
lows: p = 0.008; n = 3 and 4 mice for WT and Df(16)A+/� mice,
respectively).
The typical onset of behavioral symptoms of schizophrenia
occurs during early adulthood. We wondered whether the
change we observed in PV+ IN density might also be age
dependent. Therefore, we quantified the density of PV+ INs in
4-week-old mice. The density of PV+ cells in 4-week-old WT
mice was similar to that observed in older mice. Notably, how-
ever, the density of PV+ cells in area CA2 was identical between

 WT and Df(16)A+/� mice (Figures 1C and 1D; SO results were as
follows: 6,662 ± 839 for WT versus 6,703 ± 1,203 for Df(16)A+/�
mice, p = 0.97; SP results were as follows: 22,430 ± 1,465 for
WT versus 22,728 ± 1,496 for Df(16)A+/� mice, p = 0.89; n = 6
for WT and 6 for Df(16)A+/� mice). Overall, our results show
that the Df(16)A+/� mice recapitulate one of the most consistent
cellular phenotypes observed in the hippocampus of patients
with schizophrenia, i.e., an age-dependent decrease in PV+
cell density in area CA2.
The Inhibitory Control of Excitatory Drive from CA3 Is
Reduced in Adult Df(16)A+/– Mice
Inhibitory transmission in area CA2 powerfully controls the
strength of excitatory transmission from the Schaeffer collat-
eral (SC) inputs and completely prevents CA3 neurons from
evoking action potential firing in CA2 pyramidal neurons (PNs).
To address whether the decrease in PV+ neurons observed in
Df(16)A+/� mice could affect the control of the excitatory drive
from CA3 PNs, we monitored the postsynaptic potentials
(PSPs) in CA2 PNs in response to stimulation of SC inputs before
and after blockade of GABA receptors. The depolarizing phase of
the PSP in control conditions was very small in WT mice and was
truncated by a large hyperpolarizing component. The addition of
GABA receptor blockers markedly increased the amplitude of the
excitatory PSP (EPSP; Figures 2A and 2B). In the absence of
GABA receptor blockers, the depolarizing component of the
PSP was significantly larger in Df(16)A+/� mice than in WT mice
(Figure 2B; n = 8, 3 mice for WT; n = 17, 6 mice for Df(16)A+/�
mice; ANOVA two-way RM results for genotype were as follows:
F(1,7) = 6.89, p = 0.03; results for stimulation were as follows:
F(2.06,14.4) = 50.3, p = 0.00000027; and results for genotype 3
stimulation were as follows: F(2.6,18.4) = 2.03, p = 0.14).
However, in the presence of GABA receptor blockers, the
EPSPs in WT and Df(16)A+/� mice were not different (Figures
2A and 2B; n = 8, 3 mice for WT; n = 17, 6 mice for Df(16)A+/�
mice; ANOVA two-way RM results for genotype were as follows:
F(1,6) = 0.00032, p = 0.98; results for stimulation were as follows:
F(1.7,10.24) = 185.9, p = 1.37 3 10�8; and results for genotype 3
stimulation were as follows: F(1.42,8.56) = 0.23, p = 0.72). When
we examined the change in PSP amplitude before and after
blocking inhibition, the 4- to 5-fold increase observed in WT
mice was significantly reduced to 2- to 3-fold in Df(16)A+/�
mice (Figure 2C; n = 8, 3 mice for WT; n = 17, 6 mice for
Df(16)A+/� mice; ANOVA two-way RM results for genotype
were as follows: F(1,7) = 6.89, p = 0.03; results for stimulation
were as follows: F(2.1,14.4) = 50.3, p = 2.7 3 10�7; and results
for genotype 3 stimulation were as follows: F(2.6,18.4) = 2.03,
p = 0.14). Finally, to isolate the inhibitory component evoked dur-
ing the stimulation, we subtracted the responses in the presence
of GABA receptor blockers from the responses with intact inhibi-
tion. Inferring the inhibitory PSP (IPSP) size from a compound
EPSP-IPSP has previously been validated in other studies
(Basu et al., 2013; Pouille and Scanziani, 2001). We found that
the deduced IPSP was significantly smaller in Df(16)A+/� mice
(Figure 2D; n = 8, 3 mice for WT; n = 17, 6 mice for Df(16)A+/�
mice; ANOVA two-way RM results for genotype were as follows:
F(1,7) = 7.19, p = 0.03; results for stimulation were as follows:
F(2.6,18.2) = 169.4, p = 3.7 3 10�13; and results for genotype 3
stimulation were as follows: F(1.99,13.97) = 7.0, p = 0.0078).
These results show that the depolarizing component of the
compound EPSP-IPSP is larger in Df(16)A+/� mice and that this
increased PSP in the absence of GABA receptor blockers results
from a decrease in the level of inhibitory transmission.

 Because the change in PV+ IN density is age dependent, we
measured the amplitude of the PSPs with and without inhibition
and quantified the amplitude of deduced IPSPs for 4- to 5-week-
old mice. We observed no difference in the amplitude of the PSP
between WT and Df(16)A+/� mice (Figure 2E; n = 6, 4 mice for
WT; n = 5, 5 mice for Df(16)A+/� mice; ANOVA two-way RM
results for genotype were as follows: F(1,4) = 1.38 3 10�7, p =
0.99; results for stimulation were as follows: F(3.0,12.0) = 57.3,
p = 2.14 3 10�7; and results for genotype 3 stimulation were
as follows: F(1.3,5.21) = 0.39, p = 0.61 for the PSP before
blockers; ANOVA two-way RM results for genotype were as fol-
lows: F(1,3) = 0.12, p = 0.74; results for stimulation were as fol-
lows: F(1.9,5.8) = 148.2, p = 1.08 3 10�5; and results for geno-
type 3 stimulation were as follows: F(1.3,3.9) = 0.25, p = 0.70
after GABA blockers). We also observed no difference in the
amplitude of the deduced IPSP (Figure 2F; n = 6, 4 mice for
WT; n = 5, 5 mice for Df(16)A+/� mice; ANOVA two-way RM
results for genotype were as follows: F(1,3) = 0.036, p = 0.86; re-
sults for stimulation were as follows: F(1.7,5.17) = 66.5, p = 2.3 3
10�4; and results for genotype 3 stimulation were as follows:
F(1.6,4.9) = 0.22, p = 0.76). Therefore, these results indicate
that the decrease in PV+ IN number and in recruited inhibition re-
sults from of a change during periadolescent development.
The inhibition onto pyramidal cells comes from the recruit-
ment of feedforward inhibition engaged by the SC but also
potentially from a direct activation of inhibitory cells and axons
by the stimulating electrode. To address whether the feed-
forward inhibition is impaired in Df(16)A+/� mice, we directly
monitored inhibitory postsynaptic currents (IPSCs) at a holding
potential of 0 mV (the reversal potential for excitatory currents)
before and after blocking excitatory transmission. In control
conditions, both the directly activated inhibition and the feedfor-
ward inhibition will be present, while only directly activated inhi-
bition will be monitored after blocking excitation. We quantified
the amount of feedforward inhibition by subtracting IPSCs in
AMPA/NMDA blockers from the IPSCs in control conditions.
We found that the level of feedforward inhibition was �30%
larger in WT mice compared to Df(16)A+/� mice (Figures S2A
and S2B; for instance, at 20V stimulation the results for WT
were as follows: 1,764.8 ± 262.1 pA, n = 17, 7 mice; and the re-
sults for Df(16)A+/� mice were as follows: 1,274.1 ± 211.9 pA, n =
15, 7 mice; ANOVA two-way RM results for genotype were as
follows: F(1,13) = 5.59, p = 0.034; results for stimulation were
as follows: F(1.6,21.0) = 51.47, p = 2.79 3 10�8; and results for
genotype 3 stimulation were as follows: F(1.96,25.5) = 0.95,
p = 0.39).
The decrease in the level of feedforward inhibition could
result from a decrease in the number of recruited INs or from a
decrease in GABA release probability. We performed a paired
stimulation to quantify the paired-pulse ratio (PPR) of two
consecutive IPSCs, a parameter inversely proportional to
release probability. When IPSCs were isolated in the presence
of AMPA/NMDA receptor blockers, we found that the PPR
(with a stimulation interval of 100 ms) was identical for WT and
Df(16)A+/� mice over the entire stimulation intensity range (Fig-
ure S2C; n = 15, 6 mice for WT; n = 15, 6 mice for Df(16)A+/�
mice; ANOVA two-way RM results for genotype were as follows:
F(1,6) = 2.25, p = 0.18; results for stimulation were as follows:
F(3.6,21.9) = 1.34, p = 0.28; and results for genotype 3 stimula-
tion were as follows: F(2.3,14.2) = 0.70, p = 0.53). We also
measured the PPR at different stimulation intervals (between
20 and 800 ms) and again found no difference between WT
and Df(16)A+/� mice (Figure S2D; n = 10, 5 mice for WT; n =
11, 5 mice for Df(16)A+/� mice; ANOVA two-way RM results for
genotype were as follows: F(1,8) = 0.27, p = 0.61; results for stim-
ulation were as follows: F(2.2,17.9) = 4.4, p = 0.02; and results for
genotype 3 stimulation were as follows: F(2.3,18.7) = 1.7, p =
0.20). Finally, because an increase in summation of synaptic
responses during a train at CA3-CA1 excitatory synapses had
previously been reported in Df(16)A+/� mice (Earls et al., 2010),
we looked at the EPSP summation during a train of five pulses
at the CA3-CA2 synapse. We found no difference between WT
and Df(16)A+/� mice (Figure S2E; n = 6, 3 mice for WT; n = 7, 4
mice for Df(16)A+/� mice; ANOVA two-way RM results for geno-
type were as follows: F(1,3) = 0.10 p = 0.77; results for stimulation
were as follows: F(1.8,5.6) = 102.6, p = 3.6 3 10�5; and results for
genotype 3 stimulation were as follows: F(1.2,3.6) = 0.15, p =
0.76). These results suggest that release probability at inhibitory
synapses is not significantly altered in Df(16)A+/� mice and that
the decrease in feedforward inhibition is likely a consequence
of the decrease in PV+ IN function.
Distal Excitatory Transmission Is Not Affected in Df(16)
A+/– Mice
CA2 PNs receive excitatory input from CA3 SCs on proximal
apical dendrites and excitatory input from the entorhinal cortex
on distal apical dendrites. To address whether the change we
observed in Df(16)A+/� mice on the inhibitory control of excit-
atory transmission is input specific or a general feature in these
mice, we stimulated in stratum lacunosum moleculare (SLM)
and recorded PSPs before and after blocking inhibitory trans-
mission. As reported previously, EPSPs from distal inputs were
much less affected by blockade of inhibition than EPSPs from
proximal
inputs
(Chevaleyre
and
Siegelbaum,
2010).
We
observed no difference in the PSP amplitude between adult
WT and Df(16)A+/� mice, both in control conditions and following
inhibition block (Figures 3A and 3B; n = 7, 3 mice for WT; n = 17, 6
mice for Df(16)A+/� mice; ANOVA two-way RM results for geno-
type were as follows: F(1,5) = 0.07, p = 0.79; results for stimula-
tion were as follows: F(1.7,8.5) = 51.5, p = 2.25 3 10�5; and
results for genotype 3 stimulation were as follows: F(1.7,8.8) =
0.15, p = 0.83 before GABA receptor blockers; ANOVA two-
way RM results for genotype were as follows: F(1,5) = 0.0018,
p = 0.96; results for stimulation were as follows: F(1.6,8.0) =
101.05, p = 3.04 3 10�6; and results for genotype 3 stimulation
were as follows: F(1.7,8.7) = 0.52, p = 0.58 after GABA receptor
blockers). Similarly, the increase in PSP amplitude after blocking
inhibition and the deducted IPSP responses with and without
GABA receptor blockers were also unaffected in Df(16)A+/�
mice (Figures 3C and 3D; n = 7, 3 mice for WT; n = 17, 6 mice
for Df(16)A+/� mice; ANOVA two- way RM results for genotype
were as follows: F(1,2) = 0.019, p = 0.90; results for stimulation
were as follows: F(1.2,2.4) = 4.07, p = 0.16; results for
genotype 3 stimulation were as follows: F(1.7,3.4) = 0.039, p =
0.94 for the fold increase in PSP; ANOVA two-way RM results
for genotype were as follows: F(1,5) = 0.31, p = 0.59; results

 for stimulation were as follows: F(1.9,9.9) = 22.3, p = 226 3 10�4;
and results for genotype 3 stimulation were as follows:
F(2.9,14.5) = 0.37, p = 0.76 for the IPSP).
We quantified the amplitude of the PSPs with and without
inhibition and the amplitude of the deduced IPSPs in 4- to
5-week-old mice. We observed no difference in the amplitude
of the PSP between WT and Df(16)A+/� mice (Figure 3E; n = 6,
3 mice for WT; n = 6, 4 mice for Df(16)A+/� mice; ANOVA two-
way RM results for genotype were as follows: F(1,4) = 0.001,
p = 0.97; results for stimulation were as follows: F(2.1,8.5) =
40.9, p = 3.85 3 10�5; and results for genotype 3 stimulation
were as follows: F(1.2,4.6) = 0.062, p = 0.84 for the PSP before

type were as follows: F(1,4) = 0.002, p = 0.97; results for stimu-
lation were as follows: F(2.0,8.2) = 77.22, p = 4.5 3 10�6; and
results for genotype 3 stimulation were as follows: F(1.2,4.9) =
0.053, p = 0.87 after GABA receptor blockers) and no difference
in the amplitude of the deduced IPSP (Figure 3F; ANOVA two-
way RM results for genotype were as follows: F(1,3) = 0.42, p =
0.56; results for stimulation were as follows: F(2.2,6.7) = 26.3,
p = 5.8 3 10�4; and results for genotype 3 stimulation were as
follows: F(1.9,5.9) = 0.32, p = 0.73). These results indicate that
the change in inhibitory transmission in Df(16)A+/� mice is input
specific, with a decrease in feedforward inhibition recruited by
SC proximal inputs but no change in feedforward inhibition re-
cruited by distal inputs.
Adult Df(16)A+/– Mice CA2 Pyramidal Neurons Have a
More Hyperpolarized Resting Membrane Potential
A large feedforward inhibition prevents CA3 SC inputs from
evoking action potential firing in CA2 PNs. However, when inhi-
bition is pharmacologically blocked, stimulation of SC inputs can
easily evoke action potential firing in CA2 PNs. Because feed-
forward inhibition is reduced in Df(16)A+/� mice, SC stimulation
should more easily evoke action potential firing in these mice.
However, this only holds true if other parameters such as the
intrinsic properties of CA2 PNs are identical in Df(16)A+/� mice.
Therefore, we measured intrinsic properties of pyramidal neu-
rons in CA2, as well as the depolarizing sag observed during a
hyperpolarizing pulse and the action potential threshold. We
found that mature (R6 weeks old) but not young Df(16)A+/�
mice had a more hyperpolarized resting potential (Figure 4A; re-
sults at post-natal week 5 were as follows: �76.6 ± 1.22 mV for
WT, n = 12; �77.4 ± 0.9 mV for Df(16)A+/� mice, n = 9, t test:
p = 0.63; results at post-natal week R6–7 were as follows:
�76.4 ± 0.5 mV for WT, n = 39; �79.8 ± 0.5 mV for Df(16)A+/�
mice, n = 51; ANOVA two-way results for genotype were as
follows: F(1,81) = 20.45, p = 2.06 3 10�5; results for age were
as follows: F(3,81) = 0.12, p = 0.94; and results for genotype 3
age were as follows: F(3,81) = 0.33, p = 0.79). A lower mem-
brane resistance in Df(16)A+/� mice was also observed at
post-natal week 9–10 (Figure 4B), but this effect was transient
and not observed in older animals. The other parameters
measured, including membrane capacitance, depolarizing sag,
and action potential threshold, were not different between
WT and Df(16)A+/� mice (Figures 4C–4E). Paralleling the
change in synaptic transmission occurring in mature Df(16)A+/�
mice, the membrane potential of CA2 PNs becomes more hy-
perpolarized in Df(16)A+/� mice over the sixth to seventh week
of life.
We next explored the molecular mechanism underlying the
change in membrane potential of CA2 PNs in Df(16)A+/� mice.
Among the channels known to control resting membrane poten-
tial, the two-pore-domain potassium channel TREK is a strong
candidate because it is highly expressed in area CA2 (Talley

 et al., 2001) and can be modulated by numerous second
messengers (Honore
´ , 2007). To isolate TREK current, we
blocked voltage-activated Ca2+, K+, Na+, and HCN channels
(with Cd2+, Ni2+, TEA, 4AP, TTX, and Cs+) and applied a ramp
protocol while recording in whole-cell voltage clamp mode
before and after application of 100 mM fluoxetine, a potent
blocker of TREK channels (Kennard et al., 2005). We restricted
the analysis of the ramp between �130 and �50 mV because a
large inward current was evoked at more depolarized potentials
(Figure S3). We found that the fluoxetine-sensitive current was
much larger in Df(16)A+/� mice as compared to WT control
mice (Figure 4F). We calculated the conductance of the fluoxe-
tine-sensitive current by fitting the slope of the I/V curves and
found that it was over three times larger in Df(16)A+/� mice (Fig-
ure 4F, inset; 0.76 pS, n = 13, 4 mice for WT; 2.77 pS, n = 13, 5
mice for Df(16)A+/� mice; t test, p = 0.018). We also observed a
significant correlation between the resting membrane potential
of the cells and the amount of fluoxetine-sensitive current
when the values from WT and Df(16)A+/� mice were plotted
together (Figure 4G; Pearson’s R = �0.53, ANOVA F(1,23) =
9.03, p = 0.006). Together, these data show that the current
mediated by TREK channels is upregulated in Df(16)A+/� mice
and potentially contributes to the more hyperpolarized PN
resting potential.

Decreased Action Potential Firing of
Pyramidal Neurons in Df(16)A+/– Mice
in Response to Proximal and Distal
Inputs Stimulation
Because of alterations in intrinsic proper-
ties, it is difficult to predict which of the
changes observed in Df(16)A+/� mice, i.e.,
the decrease in inhibition or the lower
resting membrane potential, will have a
stronger impact on the ability of CA2 PNs
to fire action potentials in response to stim-
ulation of proximal and distal inputs. There-
fore, we directly addressed this question by
applying a train of 5 pulses at 100 Hz to proximal and distal inputs
and quantified the number of action potentials evoked in CA2
PNs in WT and Df(16)A+/� mice. With inhibition intact, no action
potentials were observed when stimulating proximal inputs, both
in WT and Df(16)A+/� mice. Only a few cells (2/11) in WT fired ac-
tion potentials in response to distal input stimulation, indicating
that despite the decrease in inhibition, excitatory input does
not drive action potential firing more readily in CA2 PNs of
Df(16)A+/� mice. We then performed the same experiment after
blocking inhibition to increase the percentage of cells firing an ac-
tion potential. In response to SC stimulation, both the number of
action potentials during the train and the percentage of cells firing
at least one action potential were significantly smaller in Df(16)
A+/� mice (Figures 5A and 5B; at 30 V stimulation results for WT
mice were as follows: 2.23 ± 0.52 AP per train, 83.3% of cell firing,
n = 12, 9 mice; results for Df(16)A+/� mice were as follows: 0.56 ±
0.38 AP per train, 38.8% of cell firing, n = 18, 11 mice; at 20 and
30V ANOVA two-way RM results for genotype were as follows:
F(1,11) = 6.01, p = 0.03; results for stimulation were as follows:
F(1.11) = 7.21, p = 0.02; results for genotype 3 stimulation were
as follows: F(1,11) = 0.32, p = 0.58). Because the threshold for ac-
tion-potential firing was not different between WT and Df(16)A+/�
mice, this result suggests that the decreased ability to fire ac-
tion potential results from the more hyperpolarized membrane

 potential of PNs in Df(16)A+/� mice. Indeed, the resting potential
of PNs in Df(16)A+/� mice was more hyperpolarized even after
blocking inhibitory transmission (Figure S4A; results for WT
mice were as follows: �73.3 ± 0.5 mV, n = 13, 8 mice; results
for Df(16)A+/� mice were as follows: �75.4 ± 0.7 mV, n = 15, 9
mice; t test, p = 0.04), and injection of a small depolarizing current
in PNs of Df(16)A+/� mice to compensate for the more hyperpo-
larized resting potential was sufficient to restore the number
of action potentials to a level similar to WT mice (Figure S4B; re-
sults at 30 V stimulation were as follows: 0.66 ± 0.55 action poten-
tials per train at resting membrane potential; 2.21 ± 0.73 AP per
train after depolarization; n = 9, 7 mice; ANOVA two-way RM re-
sults for depolarization were as follows: F(1,8) = 11.1, p = 0.01; re-
sults for stimulation were as follows: F(1.2,10.2) = 12.1, p = 0.004;
and results for depolarization 3 stimulation were as follows:
F(1.1,9.2) = 12.4, p = 0.005; ANOVA two-way RM results for ge-
notype were as follows: F(1,7) = 5.9 3 10�4, p = 0.0.98; results
for stimulation were as follows: F(1.4,10.0) = 21.4, p = 4.6 3
10�4; and results for genotype 3 stimulation were as follows:
F(1.2,8.3) = 0.17, p = 0.73 between WT and Df(16)A+/� mice after
depolarization). We then looked at action potential firing in
response to stimulation of distal inputs. Again, both the number
of action potentials per train and the percentage of cells firing
at least one action potential were reduced in Df(16)A+/� mice (Fig-
ures 5C and 5D; results at 30 V stimulation for WT mice were as
follows: 0.98 ± 0.32 AP per train, 66.6% of cell firing, n = 12, 9
mice; results for Df(16)A+/� mice were as follows: 0.30 ± 0.13
AP per train, 38.8% of cell firing, n = 17, 9 mice; results at 30 V
for ANOVA one-way were as follows: F(1,27) = 4.6, p = 0.04).
These results show that the decrease in feedforward inhibition
did not facilitate action potential firing in response to proximal-
and distal-input stimulation. Instead, the more hyperpolarized
resting potential of CA2 PNs resulted in a nonspecific decrease
in action potential firing, affecting the excitatory drive of both
proximal and distal inputs.
Plasticity at Inhibitory Synapses and the Resulting
Disinhibitory Increase in SC-CA2 Synaptic Drive Are
Impaired in Df(16)A+/– Mice
While it is well-established that CA2 PNs cannot undergo a post-
synaptic LTP (Zhao et al., 2007), the inhibitory transmission from
PV+ INs in this region expresses a long-term depression (iLTD)
dependent on delta opioid receptor activation (Piskorowski
and Chevaleyre, 2013). Because the density of PV+ INs and
inhibitory transmission are reduced in Df(16)A+/� mice, we first
asked whether the magnitude of iLTD might also be reduced in
these mice. For this, we directly monitored inhibitory transmis-
sion in CA2 PNs in the presence of AMPA/NMDA receptor
blockers (NBQX, D-APV). After collecting a stable baseline, we
provided a high-frequency stimulation (HFS; two trains of 100
pulses at 100 Hz). As shown in Figure 6A, this protocol led to a
robust and lasting depression of IPSCs in WT mice (63.4% ±
3.0% of baseline, n = 9, 5 mice). Consistent with a presynaptic
locus of expression, iLTD resulted in a significant increase in
the PPR (Figure 6B; 116.6% ± 5.6%, from 0.47 ± 0.02 to
0.55 ± 0.03; paired t test, p = 0.001). Although the same stimula-
tion also led to a lasting depression in Df(16)A+/� mice, the
magnitude of the iLTD (Figure 6A; 83.3% ± 3.1% of baseline,
n = 9, 5 mice, p = 0.0003 compared to WT) and the change in
PPR (109.7% ± 3.8%, from 0.47 ± 0.03 to 0.51 ± 0.03, paired t
test, p = 0.03) were strongly reduced in these mice. These results
show that plasticity at inhibitory synapses in area CA2 is
impaired in Df(16)A+/� mice, likely because the subpopulation
of inhibitory neurons that express iLTD, i.e., PV+ INs, is also
reduced in Df(16)A+/� mice.
The iLTD in area CA2 allows for an increase in the net excit-
atory drive of SC inputs onto CA2 PNs (Nasrallah et al., 2015),
resulting in an increased PSP amplitude following iLTD induc-
tion. Because iLTD is reduced in Df(16)A+/� mice, we wondered
whether the disinhibitory-mediated increase in PSP might also
be impaired. In order to test this, we performed whole-cell
current-clamp recordings and injected current as necessary to
maintain the same resting membrane potential for WT and
Df(16)A+/� mice. Under these conditions, we found a much
smaller increase in the PSP amplitude following HFS in Df(16)
A+/� mice (Figure 7A; results for WT were as follows: 236.1% ±
10.1%, n = 6, 4 mice; results for Df(16)A+/� mice were as fol-
lows: 137.6% ± 4.5%, n = 8, 6 mice; p < 0.00001 with WT). As
previously reported, we verified that this increase in PSP was
mediated by a disinhibition as it was abolished in presence of
GABA receptor blockers, both in WT and Df(16)A+/� mice (Fig-
ure 7A; results for WT were as follows: 105.9% ± 7.9%, n = 4,

 4 mice; results for Df(16)A+/� mice were as follows: 111.0% ±
2.4%, n = 5, 5 mice; p = 0.52 with WT).
Because CA2 PNs are more hyperpolarized in Df(16)A+/� than
WT mice, the impact of inhibition on the EPSP might also be
reduced due to a smaller driving force for Cl�. Therefore, in order
to test the effect of HFS without affecting the resting membrane
potential and Cl� concentration in the PNs, we performed extra-
cellular recordings to monitor the effect of induction of iLTD by
HFS on SC-CA2 field PSP (fPSP) amplitude. We found that the
lasting increase in fPSP amplitude was completely abolished
in Df(16)A+/� mice (Figure 7B; results for WT were as follows:
165.7% ± 20.8%, n = 6, 5 mice; results for Df(16)A+/� mice
were as follows: 110.2% ± 6.9%, n = 5, 4 mice; p = 0.04 between
WT and Df(16)A+/� mice). Therefore, these data suggest that the
more profound impairment in the disinhibitory-mediated plas-
ticity observed using extracellular recordings results from both
the reduced plasticity of inhibitory transmission and the more hy-
perpolarized resting potential of pyramidal cells in Df(16)A+/�
mice.
Under basal conditions, area CA2 PNs are primarily inhibited
by SC input stimulation. However, following the induction of
iLTD in area CA2, stimulation of SC inputs is able to drive
action potential firing in CA2 PNs (Nasrallah et al., 2015). To
address whether action potential firing is impaired after induction
of plasticity in Df(16)A+/� mice, we monitored action potential
firing extracellularly in the somatic layer of area CA2 before
and after HFS. In the majority of experiments in both WT
and Df(16)A+/� mice (20/28 slices), there was no detection of
action potential firing before HFS, which would be observed in

 the extracellular recording configuration as a population spike
(PS) (Figure 8C). This confirms that most CA2 PNs are not firing
action potentials in response to SC stimulation in basal condi-
tions. Following an HFS, a large PS was observed in WT mice
in response to SC stimulation (Figure 7C, left; for instance,
from 92.8 ± 19.9 to 200.6 ± 64.8 mV at 30 V stimulation;

were as follows: F(1.0,13.7) = 2.7, p = 0.11, n = 14, 4 mice). In
Df(16)A+/� mice, HFS did not reveal a PS even at the highest
stimulation setting (Figure 7C, right; for instance, from 103.7 ±
24.8 to 136.9 ± 34.2 mV at 30 V stimulation; ANOVA two-way
RM for HFS were as follows: F(1,13) = 2.9, p = 0.11; results for
stimulation were as follows: F(1.1,14.6) = 9.7, p = 0.005; and re-
sults for HFS 3 stimulation were as follows: F(1.1,14.3) = 0.65,
p = 0.44, n = 14, 4 mice). These results show that the activity-
dependent ability of CA3 PNs to engage CA2 PNs is strongly
impaired in Df(16)A+/� mice.
Social Memory Is Impaired in Df(16)A+/– Mice
Social dysfunction is a hallmark of several psychiatric dis-
eases. Interestingly, it was recently shown that targeted
genetic silencing of CA2 PNs results in a strong deficit
in social memory formation (Hitti and Siegelbaum, 2014).
Because our results show that AP firing in CA2 PNs is strongly
reduced in Df(16)A+/� mice, both under basal conditions and
following activity-dependent plasticity at inhibitory synapses,
we wondered if this reduced level of CA2 PN activity would
have a similar effect on social learning as the complete
silencing of CA2 PNs.
In order to test this hypothesis, we used the direct interaction
test. For this test, a subject mouse is first exposed to an unfamil-
iar mouse during trial 1. During trial 2, the subject mouse is either
exposed to a second novel mouse (Figure 8A) or re-exposed to
the same mouse encountered in trial 1 (Figure 8B). We found
that exploration time for trials 1 and 2, when the subject mouse
encountered two different novel mice, was similar in WT and
Df(16)A+/� mice (ANOVA two-way RM results for genotype 3
trial were as follows: F(1,14) = 0.602, p = 0.451; results for geno-
type were as follows: F(1,14) = 0.510, p = 0.487; and results for
trial were as follows: F(1,14) = 1.806, p = 0.200). As a result,
the difference score (difference in time that the subject mouse
spends exploring the other mouse between trials 1 and 2) was
also similar between WT and Df(16)A+/� mice (Figure 8A;
�7.0 ± 6.4, n = 8 for WT and �2.6 ± 1.4, n = 8 for Df(16)A+/�
mice; results for one-way ANOVA were as follows: F(1,15) =
0.469, p = 0.5). This result suggests that sociability is not
impaired in Df(16)A+/� mice.
We then tested whether social memory was affected in Df(16)
A+/� mice. As previously reported, when the subject mouse
was re-exposed to the same mouse encountered in trial 1, the
interaction time for trial 2 was strongly decreased in WT mice (Fig-
ure 8B; from 44.5 s to 25.3 s, p < 0.01, Bonferroni post test, n = 8),
leading to a difference score of 19.1 ± 5.5. However, social mem-
ory was strongly impaired in Df(16)A+/� mice. Indeed, unlike WT
mice, Df(16)A+/� mice did not spend less time exploring a previ-
ously encountered mouse (from 47.0 s to 58.3 s, p > 0.05, Bonfer-
roni post test, n = 8) and failed to show significant recognition of
the familiar mouse (results for two-way RM ANOVA for genotype
3 trial were as follows: F(1,14) = 13.503, p = 0.0025; results for WT
were as follows: p < 0.01; results for Df(16)A+/� were as follows:

F(1,14) = 1.998, p = 0.79; and results for genotype were as fol-
lows: F(1,14) = 1.236, p = 0.285). The difference score was not
only lower than that of WT mice (�11.3 ± 4.9, one-way ANOVA,

Figure 8. Social Memory Is Impaired in Adult Df(16)A+/– Mice
(A) Top: experimental setup for the direct interaction test in which a different
stimulus animal was presented in trials 1 and 2. Bottom left: the two groups
(Df(16)A+/�, n = 8; WT, n = 8) engaged in social interaction with the two stimulus
animals for a similar amount of time. Bottom right: Df(16)A+/� mice and their
WT littermates have similar difference scores when interacting with two novel
juvenile mice (one-way ANOVA, F(1,15) = 0.469, p = 0.504).
(B) Top: experimental setup for the direct interaction test in which the same
stimulus animal was presented for both trials 1 and 2. Bottom left: unlike WT,
Df(16)A+/� mice fail to show significant recognition of the familiar animal (two-
way RM ANOVA for genotype 3 trial, F(1,14) = 13.503, p = 0.0025). Social
memory in the WT mice is evidenced by a decrement in social investigation on
trial 2, which is not the case for the Df(16)A+/� mice. Bottom right: the differ-
ence score of the Df(16)A+/� group was not only less than that of the WT group
but even had a negative value, indicating that the Df(16)A+/� show no social
memory when tested with this paradigm. Error bars show SEM.

 p = 0.002) but also had a negative value, indicating no social
learning of the Df(16)A+/� mice with this test.
These results indicate that social learning, but not sociability,
is impaired in Df(16)A+/� mice, hence mimicking the phenotype
observed in mice with complete CA2 PN silencing. Thus, our
data provide a potential cellular mechanism for the impairment
in social memory observed in patients with schizophrenia.
DISCUSSION
In this study, we reveal cellular alterations in the 22q11.2
mouse model of schizophrenia that occur uniquely in area
CA2 of the hippocampus, and we highlight social memory
impairment in these mice, a behavior critically dependent on
area CA2. In detail, we have shown that the density of PV+
INs is reduced in area CA2 of Df(16)A+/� mice and that the
level of feedforward inhibitory transmission onto CA2 PNs is
also reduced. In addition, similar to the disease onset in early
adulthood in humans, these differences were not present in
4-week-old mice. We also found age-dependent changes in
the intrinsic properties of CA2 PNs in Df(16)A+/� mice, causing
the cells to be more hyperpolarized. As a consequence, CA2
PNs in Df(16)A+/� mice displayed fewer action potentials in
response to both proximal and distal excitatory input stimula-
tion. Furthermore, the unique plasticity of inhibitory synapses
in area CA2 that typically undergoes an activity-dependent
iLTD is reduced in Df(16)A+/� mice, disrupting the disinhibitory
mechanism that allows CA3 to drive action potential firing in
CA2 PNs. Thus, information transfer and activity-dependent
modulation of the excitatory drive between CA3 and CA2 are
strongly impaired in Df(16)A+/� mice. Finally, Df(16)A+/� mice
display a deficit in social memory, a phenotype similar to the
one observed after complete silencing of CA2 PNs (Hitti and
Siegelbaum, 2014).
Loss of PV+ INs: Significance, Consequences, and
Potential Causes
Consistent with our findings, a decrease in PV+ IN density
uniquely in area CA2 has been observed both in human postmor-
tem studies and pharmacological animal models (Benes et al.,
1998; Berretta et al., 2009; Knable et al., 2004; Zhang and Rey-
nolds, 2002), recapitulating one of the most consistent changes
observed in the hippocampus during schizophrenia. A decrease
in PV+ IN number in area CA2 has also been reported in bipolar
disorder (Benes et al., 1998) and in Alzheimer’s disease-affected
brains (Brady and Mufson, 1997).
The overall importance of PV+ INs is quite clear: global impair-
ment of PV+ IN function has been shown to disrupt hippocampal
network synchrony and was accompanied by profound changes
in working and spatial memory (Fuchs et al., 2007; Korotkova
et al., 2010). Furthermore, it has recently been shown that hippo-
campal PV+ basket cells play a pivotal role in regulating memory
formation in an experience-dependent manner (Donato et al.,
2013). However, previous investigations of hippocampal proper-
ties and plasticity of Df(16)A+/� mice have revealed only fairly
modest changes in inhibitory transmission and plasticity at the
SC-CA1 synapse (Drew et al., 2011; Earls et al., 2010). Further-
more, an examination of the theta oscillation and hippocampal
synchrony of the Df(16)A+/� mice found no difference with con-
trol animals (Sigurdsson et al., 2010).
The major aim of this study was to test the hypothesis that the
PV+ INs in area CA2 in Df(16)A+/� mice are reduced and to
examine the resulting consequences in the local network. It
has recently been shown that the density of PV+ INs in mice is
much higher in area CA2 compared to CA1 and CA3 (Botcher
et al., 2014; Piskorowski and Chevaleyre, 2013), and the age-
dependent reduction of PV+ staining uniquely in area CA2 of
the hippocampus that we observe suggests that inhibitory trans-
mission from PV+ cells in this region may be playing a peculiar
function. These INs undergo a unique long-lasting delta opioid-
mediated plasticity (Piskorowski and Chevaleyre, 2013) that
allows the otherwise nonplastic CA2 PNs (Zhao et al., 2007) to
be incorporated into the hippocampal trisynaptic circuit (Nasral-
lah et al., 2015).
The most predictable consequence of the reduction in CA2
PV+ staining is the reduction in feedforward inhibition between
CA3 and CA2 PNs. It is difficult to establish a quantitative link be-
tween the decrease in PV+ IN density, the decrease in inhibitory
transmission, and the decrease in plasticity, due to uncertainty in
the subclass of PV+ cells that are affected and in the effect that
PV+ cell reduction has in iLTD and controlling the PSP amplitude.
Nevertheless, the �35% decrease in PV+ INs can account for
the �30% decrease in inhibitory transmission, and the resulting
increase in EPSP amplitude (by �60%) can account for the
decrease in disinhibitory LTP (due to an occlusion effect).
Furthermore, we have shown that PV+ INs undergo iLTD (Piskor-
owski and Chevaleyre, 2013) and that the disinhibitory increase
in PSP is entirely mediated through a decrease in inhibition re-
sulting from iLTD (Nasrallah et al., 2015). Therefore, although it
is difficult to make a quantitative link, we believe that the change
in PV+ cell density, the change in IPSP and EPSP amplitude, and
the change in plasticity are causally linked. A potential additional
outcome of the loss of inhibition is the parallel age-dependent
change in intrinsic properties of CA2 PNs. Although an exhaus-
tive study would be required to carefully examine the precise
time course of the change in inhibitory transmission, we postu-
late that the more hyperpolarized membrane potential of CA2
PNs is a compensatory effect of the decrease in inhibition.
Indeed, a persistent decrease in inhibitory transmission in CA2
might have a damaging effect on the homeostasis of the hippo-
campus, as several studies have reported a decrease or loss of
inhibition in CA2 during epilepsy (Andrioli et al., 2007; Cohen-Ga-
dol et al., 2004; Olney et al., 1983), and it has been shown that
epileptic bursts in human hippocampus are generated in area
CA2 (Wittner et al., 2009).
Interestingly, similar to findings that have revealed disinhibition
dysfunction in the neocortex (O’Donnell, 2011), our results indi-
cate that periadolescent changes in hippocampal disinhibitory
networks are also disrupted. The cause of the loss of PV staining
and feedforward inhibition after 4 weeks is an intriguing and
pertinent question given the parallel nature of disease onset in
humans.
Area CA2 and Neuropsychiatric Disorders
Our analysis of a mouse model of the 22q11.2DS revealed that
CA2 PNs are essentially rendered silent due to changes in their
172

 inherent properties, and the loss of inhibitory transmission pre-
vents activity-dependent plasticity from increasing excitatory
drive onto these cells. This finding potentially holds great signif-
icance when one considers the output of area CA2. It has been
shown recently that CA2 PNs project to several extrahippocam-
pal structures such as the medial entorhinal cortex (Rowland
et al., 2013), the medial and lateral septum, the diagonal band
of broca, and the hypothalamic supramammillary nucleus (Cui
et al., 2013). Thus, if one also considers the diverse and
numerous inputs of area CA2, which include but are not limited
to cortical, hypothalamic, and intrahippocampal origins (Cheva-
leyre and Siegelbaum, 2010; Cui et al., 2013; Hitti and Siegel-
baum, 2014; Kohara et al., 2014), CA2 is poised to be a hub
connecting the hippocampus with multiple brain regions.
Previously, it has been reported that the Df(16)A+/� mice have
reduced performance during a working-memory task and
reduced synchrony between the hippocampus and prefrontal
cortex (Sigurdsson et al., 2010; Stark et al., 2008) in the absence
of any changes in oscillations in the neocortex or hippocampus.
While there are multiple ways in which long-range connections
can be disrupted, we speculate that the significant changes we
see in CA2 PN output may potentially play a role in altering the
long-range communication between the hippocampus and
numerous other brain regions in the Df(16)A+/� mice.
The interesting role of area CA2 in social learning and hippo-
campal function has only recently emerged. Recent studies
have shown that CA2 is essential for social memory (Hitti and
Siegelbaum, 2014; Stevenson and Caldwell, 2014). In addition,
vasopressin 1b receptor, which is selectively expressed in CA2
PNs, has been shown to be a key player in modulating social
memory and aggression in rodents (Stevenson and Caldwell,
2012; Young et al., 2006). In fact, rescue of vasopressin 1b re-
ceptor expression specifically in area of CA2 in the hippocampus
restored socially motivated attack responses in vasopressin 1b
receptor knockout mice (Pagani et al., 2015). Thus, it seems
that mice with compromised CA2 function are unable to appro-
priately assess social situations.
Is there a broader role for area CA2? Recent reports investi-
gating place-cell dynamics indicate this region likely does not
encode spatial information but rather displays marked instability
over time in the same environment (Lee et al., 2015; Lu et al.,
2015; Mankin et al., 2015). A study using immediate-early gene
expression revealed that area CA2 is more sensitive than areas
CA1 and CA3 to changes in context and may be set to detect
conflicts between memory and experience (Wintzer et al.,
2014). Remarkably, area CA2 is altered in a number of psychiat-
ric disorders, including schizophrenia and bipolar disorder, as
well as in neurodegenerative diseases (Jones and McHugh,
2011). CA2 is connected to subcortical structures, including
amygdala, raphe nucleus, and hypothalamic nuclei, and projects
to higher cortical structures. Bridging primitive and higher-level
structures, the integrity of area CA2 might be necessary to finely
tune the interplay between primitive drives (i.e., hypothalamic
signals) and higher-level cognition. Thus, we speculate that a
compromised area CA2 will result in cognitive dysfunction.
Indeed, the level of dementia during Parkinson’s disease is asso-
ciated with the extent of alpha synuclein and of amyloid beta
peptide in area CA2 (Kalaitzakis et al., 2009), and the degree of
cognitive impairment is correlated with the density of Lewy neu-
rites in area CA2 (Churchyard and Lees, 1997).
Disruption in social cognition is a core symptom of schizo-
phrenia, autism spectrum disorder, and neurodegenerative dis-
eases. In schizophrenia it is among the earlier onset features
and is highly correlated with poor functional outcome (Bru
¨ ne,
2005; Penn et al., 2008). The reciprocal relation of social cogni-
tion to both positive (paranoia and delusions) and negative
(social withdrawal and reduced motivation) symptoms (Foussias
et al., 2014), place it central in current translational strategies
(Millan and Bales, 2013). Associations of social cognition impair-
ments with executive function and negative symptoms are
particularly evident in the 22q11.2DS (Campbell et al., 2015).
Obviously, rodents do not display all features of human social
cognition, and comparable information on cross-species circuit
recruitment in social interactions is scarce. What dimensions of
altered social cognition are measurable in experimental animal
models remain unknown, but there is a need for identification
of common neural substrates engaged in animals and humans
to facilitate adoption of comparable procedures and common
readouts in drug evaluation. In that respect, our results, taken
together with previous postmortem studies in patients, suggest
that altered circuitry functionality within the CA2 hippocampal
area, and its possible interactions with other relevant brain areas,
such as the amygdala, from which it receives abundant projec-
tions (Pikkarainen et al., 1999), might underlie parts of the social
cognition deficits seen in some psychiatric and neurodevelop-
mental disorders. This region of the hippocampus is consistently
overlooked or merged with other CA areas in human imaging
studies (Small et al., 2011). Clearly, our results provide strong
evidence that this region of the brain merits further study both
in animal models of psychiatric diseases and in humans. Further-
more, given the unusual property of neurons in area CA2 to be
modulated by numerous neuropeptides (Pagani et al., 2015; Pis-
korowski and Chevaleyre, 2013; Simons et al., 2012), our results
suggest that this pharmacologically unexplored region may be a
fruitful therapeutic target for psychiatric diseases.
EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURES
All animal procedures were performed in accordance with the regulations of
the animal care committee of the Universite
´ Paris Descartes and of Columbia
University.
Slice Preparation
A 400 mm transverse hippocampal slices were prepared from 6- to 17-week-
old C57BL6 or Df(16)A+/� male mice. Animals were euthanized in accordance
with institutional regulations under anesthesia with isofluorane. Hippocampi
were removed and placed upright into an agar mold and cut with a vibra-
tome in ice-cold extracellular slicing solution (for solution compositions,
see Supplemental Experimental Procedures) The slices were then transferred
to 30�C artificial cerebral spinal fluid, ACSF, for 30 min and kept at room
temperature for at least 1.5 hr before recording. All experiments were per-
formed at 33�C.
Electrophysiological Recordings and Analysis
Field recordings of PSPs were performed in current-clamp mode with a
recording patch pipette (3–5 MU) containing 1 M of NaCl and positioned in
the middle of stratum radiatum of CA2. Whole-cell recordings were obtained
from CA2 PNs in current-clamp mode held at �73 mV with a patch pipette
(3–5 MU) containing a KMethylSulfate-based solution. Inhibitory currents

 were recorded with pipette solution containing CesiumMethylSulfate. The
liquid junction potential was �2 mV, and membrane potentials were corrected
for this junction potential. Series resistance (typically 12–18 MU) was moni-
tored throughout each experiment, and cells with more than 15% change
were excluded from analysis. The K+ current mediated by TREK channels
was recorded with a modified ACSF containing reduced sodium and blockers
for voltage-gated Ca2+, K+, Na+, and cationic channels. Cell-capacity current
and access resistance were compensated with the amplifier circuitry, and se-
ries resistance compensation was set at 80%–95% and frequently checked
during the experiment. We performed a ramp from �120 to +20 mV (liquid
junction potential was measured and corrected post hoc) before and after
application of fluoxetine to block TREK channels (Figure S3). The subtracted
current is shown in Figure 4F; the I/V curves and the conductance was esti-
mated between �130 and �90 mV.
We identified the CA2 PNs by somatic location and size. The cell type
was confirmed by several electrophysiological properties (input resistance,
membrane capacitance, resting membrane potential, sag amplitude, action
potential amplitude, and duration) as previously described (Chevaleyre and
Siegelbaum, 2010).
Synaptic potentials were evoked by monopolar stimulation with a patch
pipette filled with ACSF and positioned in the middle of CA1 SR. The ampli-
tudes of the PSPs or PSCs were normalized to the baseline amplitude. An
HFS (100 pulses at 100 Hz repeated twice) was applied following stable base-
line. The magnitude of plasticity was estimated by comparing averaged
responses at 30–40 min for whole cell and at 50–60 min for extracellular
recordings after the induction protocol with baseline-averaged responses
from 0 to 10 min before the induction protocol. We used pClamp10 and
Axograph X software for data acquisition and Origin Pro for data analysis.
Statistical comparisons were performed using Student’s t test or two-way
ANOVA with repeated measure (RM), and we used a Greenhouse-Geiser for
correction of degrees of freedom when sphericity was not assumed. Results
are reported as mean ± SEM.
Immunohistochemistry
For histology experiments, 4- or 8-week-old male mice were transcardially
perfused, the brains were dissected and postfixed, and 30 mm floating coronal
sections were prepared. Eight serial sections were selected spanning bregma
�1.8 to �2.1. A rabbit anti-parvalbumin antibody (Swant) was used at a dilution
of 1:2,000; the mouse monoclonal anti-RGS14 antibody (Neuromab) was used
at dilution of 1:300. Images were collected with a Zeiss 710 laser-scanning
confocal microscope. z series images consisting of two channels were
collected every 5 mm over a total distance of 35 mm per slice. RGS14 staining
was used to define area CA2. All image analysis was performed with ImageJ.
All experimenters were blind to the genotype of the animals for all record-
ings, imaging, and analysis (including quantification of PV+ IN density).
Social Memory-Direct Interaction with Juveniles
All mice were housed two to five in each cage and given ad libitum access to
food and water. They were kept on a 12 hr (6:00–18:00) light–dark cycle with
the room temperature regulated between 21�C and 23�C. Behavioral tests
were performed during the light cycle in a testing room adjunct to the mouse
housing room, which minimizes any transportation stress. Immediately prior
to the experimental sessions, 10- to 12-week-old Df(16)A+/� and WT litter-
mates were transferred to the testing room and placed into individual cages,
identical to the ones used for housing, where they were allowed to habituate
to the new environment for 15 min. Male juvenile mice (C57BL/6J, 4–5 weeks
old) were also placed in the testing room in their home cages and allowed to
habituate for a similar amount of time. Testing began when a novel juvenile
mouse was introduced to a cage with one of the adult experimental mice.
Activity was monitored for 5 min (trial 1) and scored online by a trained
observer blind to the genotype of the test mice for social behavior (anogenital
and nose-to-nose sniffing, close following, and allogrooming) initiated by the
experimental subject, as described by (Hitti and Siegelbaum, 2014). After an
intertrial interval of 1 hr, the experimental mice were introduced to either the
previously encountered mouse or a novel mouse again for 5 min (trial 2). The
time spent in social interaction during trial 1 was subtracted from the social
interaction time during trial 2 to obtain the difference score. Statistical signifi-
cance was assessed by one-way ANOVA, or two-way RM ANOVA where
appropriate.
