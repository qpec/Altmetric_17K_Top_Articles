 Summary
Background—A previous aggregate data meta-analysis of randomised controlled trials showed 
that vitamin D supplementation reduces the rate of asthma exacerbations requiring treatment with 
systemic corticosteroids. Whether this effect is restricted to patients with low baseline vitamin D 
status is unknown.
Methods—For this systematic review and one-step and two-step meta-analysis of individual 
participant data, we searched MEDLINE, Embase, the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled 
Trials, and Web of Science for double-blind, placebo-controlled, randomised controlled trials of 
vitamin D3 or vitamin D2 supplementation in people with asthma that reported incidence of 
asthma exacerbation, published between database inception and Oct 26, 2016. We analysed 
individual participant data requested from the principal investigator for each eligible trial, 
adjusting for age and sex, and clustering by study. The primary outcome was the incidence of 
asthma exacerbation requiring treatment with systemic corticosteroids. Mixed-effects regression 
models were used to obtain the pooled intervention effect with a 95% CI. Subgroup analyses were 
done to determine whether effects of vitamin D on risk of asthma exacerbation varied according to 
baseline 25-hydroxyvitamin D (25[OH]D) concentration, age, ethnic or racial origin, body-mass 
index, vitamin D dosing regimen, use of inhaled corticosteroids, or end-study 25(OH)D levels; 
post-hoc subgroup analyses were done according to sex and study duration. This study was 
registered with PROSPERO, number CRD42014013953.
Findings—Our search identified 483 unique studies, eight of which were eligible randomised 
controlled trials (total 1078 participants). We sought individual participant data for each and 
obtained it for seven studies (955 participants). Vitamin D supplementation reduced the rate of 
asthma exacerbation requiring treatment with systemic corticosteroids among all participants 
(adjusted incidence rate ratio [aIRR] 0·74, 95% CI 0·56–0·97; p=0·03; 955 participants in seven 
studies; high-quality evidence). There were no significant differences between vitamin D and 
placebo in the proportion of participants with at least one exacerbation or time to first 
exacerbation. Subgroup analyses of the rate of asthma exacerbations treated with systemic 
corticosteroids revealed that protective effects were seen in participants with baseline 25(OH)D of 
less than 25 nmol/L (aIRR 0·33, 0·11–0·98; p=0·046; 92 participants in three studies; moderate-
quality evidence) but not in participants with higher baseline 25(OH)D levels (aIRR 0·77, 0·58–
1·03; p=0·08; 764 participants in six studies; moderate-quality evidence; pinteraction=0·25). p values 
for interaction for all other subgroup analyses were also higher than 0·05; therefore, we did not 
show that the effects of this intervention are stronger in any one subgroup than in another. Six 
studies were assessed as being at low risk of bias, and one was assessed as being at unclear risk of 
bias. The two-step meta-analysis did not reveal evidence of heterogeneity of effect (I2=0·0, 
p=0·56).
Interpretation—Vitamin D supplementation reduced the rate of asthma exacerbations requiring 
treatment with systemic corticosteroids overall. We did not find definitive evidence that effects of 
this intervention differed across subgroups of patients.

 Introduction
Asthma affects more than 300 million people worldwide and is estimated to cause almost 
400 000 deaths annually.1,2 Asthma mortality arises primarily during episodes of acute 
worsening of symptoms, termed exacerbations, which are commonly precipitated by viral 
upper respiratory infections.3 Virus-induced asthma exacerbations are associated with 
increased production of pro-inflammatory cytokines such as interleukin 17A, which 
exacerbate allergic airway responses.4 Vitamin D metabolites support antiviral responses in 
respiratory epithelial cells5 and inhibit production of interleukin 17A in peripheral blood 
mononuclear cells isolated from patients with severe asthma.6 Low circulating 
concentrations of the major circulating vitamin D metabolite, 25-hydroxyvitamin D 
(25[OH]D), are associated with increased risk of asthma exacerbation in both children7 and 
adults,8 and eight double-blind, placebo-controlled, randomised controlled trials (RCTs)9–
16 have been published investigating the effects of vitamin D supplementation on the risk of 
asthma exacerbation. So far, six meta-analyses incorporating data from trials of vitamin D 
for the management of asthma have been done: four reported protective effects of vitamin D 
supplementation against asthma exacerbation,17–20 one reported no such effect,21 and one 
did not attempt a meta-analysis for the outcome of exacerbation.22 The most recent of these, 
a Cochrane systematic review20 and aggregate data meta-analysis including data from both 
children and adults and restricted to double-blind, placebo-controlled RCTs found that 
vitamin D supplementation reduced the rate of asthma exacerbations requiring treatment 
with systemic corticosteroids by 36%.20 However, insufficient access to individual 
participant data (IPD) meant that subgroup analyses could not be done to address the 
question of whether protective effects of vitamin D supplementation against asthma 
exacerbation are stronger in individuals with low baseline vitamin D status; the theory being 
that individuals with the lowest baseline levels of a micronutrient might be expected to 
derive the greatest benefit from its replacement. In keeping with this hypothesis, protective 
effects of vitamin D supplementation against acute respiratory infection23 and acute 
exacerbations of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease24,25 have been reported to be 
strongest in individuals with low circulating 25(OH)D concentrations. We therefore set out 
to obtain IPD from double-blind, placebo-controlled RCTs investigating the effects of 
vitamin D supplementation on the risk of asthma exacerbation, and then to meta-analyse the 
data to obtain an updated estimate of the overall effectiveness of the supplementation and to 
determine whether the effects of this intervention vary according to baseline vitamin D 
status.
Methods
Search strategy and selection criteria
The methods for this systematic review and one-step and two-step meta-analysis were 
described in an outline protocol that was registered with the PROSPERO International 
Prospective Register of Systematic Reviews. The outline protocol includes populations of 
people at risk of acute respiratory infection, and people with asthma and chronic obstructive 
pulmonary disease. This systematic review and meta-analysis of individual participant data 
focuses on people with asthma. A systematic review and meta-analysis of individual

 participant data in people with acute respiratory infection has been previously published.23 
Research ethics committee approval was not required in the UK to do this meta-analysis; 
local ethical permission to contribute de-identified IPD from primary RCTs was required 
and obtained for studies by Urashima and colleagues9 and Tachimoto and colleagues14 
(ethics committee of the Jikei University School of Medicine). Findings are reported 
according to the PRISMA guidelines for IPD meta-analysis.26
Double-blind, placebo-controlled RCTs of supplementation with vitamin D3 or vitamin D2 
in patients with asthma were eligible for inclusion if they had been approved by a research 
ethics committee and if data on incidence of asthma exacerbation were reported.
Two investigators (DAJ and ARM) searched MEDLINE, Embase, the Cochrane Central 
Register of Controlled Trials, and Web of Science using the electronic search strategies 
described in the appendix (p 1). We regularly updated our searches from database inception 
up to and including Oct 26, 2016. No language restrictions were imposed. We supplemented 
these searches by searching review articles and reference lists of trial publications. 
Collaborators were asked if they knew of any additional RCTs. Three investigators (DAJ, 
CAC Jr, and ARM) determined which studies met the eligibility criteria.
Data analysis
We requested IPD from the principal investigator for each eligible trial, and the terms of 
collaboration were specified in a data transfer agreement, signed by representatives of the 
data provider and the recipient (Queen Mary University of London). Data were de-identified 
at source before transfer via email. On receipt, three investigators (DAJ, RLH, and LG) 
assessed data integrity by doing internal consistency checks and by attempting to replicate 
results of the analysis for incidence of asthma exacerbations where this was published in the 
trial report. We contacted study authors to obtain missing data and to resolve queries arising 
from these integrity checks. Once queries had been resolved, clean data were uploaded to the 
main study database, which was held in STATA IC version 12 (College Station, TX, USA).
We extracted data relating to study characteristics for the following variables: setting, 
eligibility criteria, details of intervention and control regimens, and study duration. Where 
available, we extracted IPD for certain variables relating to baseline characteristics and 
follow-up data. Baseline data were requested for age, sex, racial or ethnic origin, weight, 
height, serum 25(OH) D concentration, study allocation (vitamin D vs placebo), and details 
of stratification variables if applicable. Follow-up data were requested for the total number 
of asthma exacerbations requiring treatment with systemic corticosteroids, resulting in 
emergency department attendance or hospital admission, or both, and as defined in the trial 
protocol; time from first dose of study drug to first asthma exacerbation requiring treatment 
with systemic corticosteroids; occurrence of serious adverse events and potential adverse 
reactions to vitamin D supplementation (hypercalcaemia or renal stones); serum 25(OH)D 
concentration at final follow-up; and duration of participant follow-up.
We used the Cochrane Collaboration Risk of Bias tool27 to assess the following variables: 
sequence generation; allocation concealment; blinding of participants, personnel, and 
outcome assessors; completeness of outcome data; evidence of selective outcome reporting;

 and other potential threats to validity. We assessed selectivity of reporting either by 
comparing study protocols against study reports or by specifically asking study authors 
whether all prespecified outcomes were reported. Two investigators (ARM and DAJ) 
independently assessed study quality, except for the trial by Martineau and colleagues,12 
which was assessed by CAC Jr. Discrepancies were resolved by consensus.
The primary outcome of the meta-analysis was incidence of asthma exacerbation requiring 
treatment with systemic corticosteroids. We selected this outcome on the basis that 
requirement for systemic corticosteroids is a widely recognised indicator of exacerbation 
severity.28 We measured the primary outcome as rate of asthma exacerbations, proportion of 
participants with at least one exacerbation, and time to first exacerbation. Secondary 
outcomes were incidence of exacerbations resulting in emergency department attendance or 
hospital admission, or both; incidence of exacerbations as defined in the protocol of the 
primary trial; incidence of serious adverse events; incidence of potential adverse reactions to 
vitamin D (hypercalcaemia and renal stones); and mortality (asthma related and all cause).
Effects of the intervention on event rates, dichotomous outcomes, and time to first event 
were expressed as rate ratios (RRs), odds ratios (ORs), and hazard ratios (HRs), respectively. 
LG, DAJ and RLH analysed the data. Our IPD meta-analysis approach followed published 
guidelines.29 Initially, all studies were reanalysed separately; the original authors were 
asked to confirm accuracy of this reanalysis where it had been done previously, and any 
discrepancies were resolved. Then, for each outcome separately, we did both one-step and 
two-step IPD meta-analyses. In the one-step approach, IPD from all studies were modelled 
simultaneously while accounting for the clustering of participants within studies. We used 
mixed models, with a random effect for study and fixed effects for age and sex, to obtain the 
pooled intervention effect with a 95% CI. We analysed event rates using mixed-effect 
Poisson regression; proportions using mixed-effects logistic regression, additionally adjusted 
for duration of participant follow-up; and survival data using mixed-effects parametric 
survival models. We did not adjust for other covariates because missing values for some 
participants would have led to their exclusion from statistical analyses. In the two-step 
approach, IPD were first analysed for each separate study independently to produce an 
estimate of the treatment effect for that study. We analysed event rates using Poisson 
regression, with adjustment for age and sex; proportions using logistic regression with 
adjustment for age, sex, and duration of participant follow-up; and survival data using 
parametric survival models, with adjustment for age and sex. We then calculated a weighted 
average of the individual treatment effect estimates using the DerSimonian and Laird 
procedure for random-effects meta-analysis.30 For the two-step IPD meta-analysis, we 
summarised heterogeneity using the I2 statistic.
To investigate the causes of heterogeneity and identify factors modifying the effects of 
vitamin D supplementation, we did prespecified subgroup analyses by extending the one-
step meta-analysis framework to include treatment-covariate interaction terms. Subgroups 
were defined according to baseline vitamin D status (serum 25[OH]D <25 nmol/L vs ≥25 
nmol/L), age (<16 years vs ≥16 years), ethnic or racial origin (African-American, Afro-
Caribbean, or black African origin vs Asian origin vs white European origin vs other or 
mixed origin), body-mass index (<25 kg/m2 vs ≥25 kg/m2), vitamin D dosing regimen (daily

 or weekly administration without bolus dosing vs administration of a regimen including at 
least one bolus dose of at least 30 000 IU vitamin D), dose size (daily equivalent <2000 IU 
vs ≥2000 IU), and concomitant asthma treatment (use of inhaled corticosteroids vs not). The 
25 nmol/L cutoff for baseline 25(OH)D concentration in the subgroup analyses was selected 
because it is the threshold for vitamin D deficiency defined by the UK Department of 
Health31 and because, below this level, vitamin D supplementation protects most strongly 
against acute respiratory infection.23 We also did an exploratory analysis investigating 
effects in subgroups defined using the 50 nmol/L and 75 nmol/L cutoffs for baseline 
circulating 25(OH)D concentration because observational studies have reported that less 
profound states of vitamin D deficiency might associate independently with increased risk of 
asthma exacerbation.7,8 We also did exploratory subgroup analyses by sex and study 
duration (<6 months vs ≥6 months) in response to comments from reviewers. Statistical 
significance was inferred for subgroup effects in which the p value for the treatment-
covariate interaction terms was less than 0·05. We did a responder analysis in participants 
randomly assigned to the intervention arm of included studies for whom end-study 25(OH)D 
data were available, comparing risk of asthma exacerbations treated with systemic 
corticosteroids in participants who attained a serum 25(OH)D of 75 nmol/L or higher vs 
participants who did not.
For the primary analysis of rate of exacerbations requiring systemic steroids, the likelihood 
of publication bias was investigated through the construction of a contour-enhanced funnel 
plot.32 We used the five GRADE considerations (study limitations, consistency of effect, 
imprecision, indirectness, and publication bias)33 to assess the quality of the body of 
evidence contributing to the principal analyses of rate of exacerbations requiring systemic 
steroids, the proportion of participants with at least one exacerbation requiring emergency 
department attendance or hospital admission, or both, and the proportion of participants with 
at least one serious adverse event.
Data were analysed using STATA IC, version 12. This study was registered with the 
PROSPERO, number CRD42014013953.
Role of the funding source
The National Institute of Health Research had no role in study design, data collection, data 
analysis, or data interpretation, or writing of the report. The corresponding author had full 
access to all the data in the study and had final responsibility for the decision to submit for 
publication.
Results
Our search identified 483 unique studies that we assessed for eligibility, of which eight 
studies with a total of 1078 randomly assigned participants fulfilled eligibility criteria (figure 
1). We sought IPD for all eight studies, which we obtained for seven (total 978 participants); 
data were not obtained for one study (100 participants) because the corresponding author did 
not respond to invitations to contribute IPD to this meta-analysis. Outcome data were 
obtained for 955 (98%) of 978 randomly assigned participants in these seven studies.

 The seven analysed RCTs were done in six different countries on three continents, and 
enrolled participants of both sexes aged 1·6–85·0 years (table 1). Five RCTs with a total of 
297 included participants enrolled children, and two RCTs with a total of 658 included 
participants enrolled adults (table 1). Baseline serum 25(OH)D concentrations were 
determined in six RCTs, ranging from undetectable to 187·2 nmol/L; table 1). All studies 
administered oral vitamin D3 to participants in the intervention arm: this was given as a 
bolus dose every 2 months in one study (100 000 IU per bolus); as a daily dose in four 
studies (ranging from 500 IU/day to 2000 IU/day; and as a combination of bolus and daily 
doses in two studies (100 000 IU bolus then 400–4000 IU/day). Study durations ranged from 
15 weeks to 1 year. Details of the number of asthma exacerbations treated with systemic 
corticosteroids and the proportion of participants experiencing at least one such event by arm 
and study are presented in appendix (p 3). In two RCTs,9,10 no asthma exacerbations 
requiring treatment with systemic corticosteroids arose, and in one trial,14 only one asthma 
exacerbation requiring treatment with systemic corticosteroids arose. Effect estimates could 
not be calculated for these three studies individually; accordingly, these studies contributed 
data to the one-step, but not the two-step, meta-analyses.
IPD integrity was confirmed by replication of primary analyses in published papers where 
applicable. The process of checking IPD revealed two discrepancies with primary reports. In 
the trial by Urashima and colleagues,9 the relative risk for asthma exacerbation was 
calculated using denominators based on the study population as a whole, irrespective of 
whether or not the participants had asthma (n=334). By contrast, we calculated this figure 
using denominators based on the number of children with asthma for whom outcome data 
were available (n=99). In the trial by Castro and colleagues,11 IPD detailed 14 serious 
adverse events arising in participants randomly assigned to placebo, as compared with 13 
such events reported in the published manuscript.
Details of the risk of bias assessment are provided in appendix (p 4). All RCTs, but one, 
were assessed as being at low risk of bias for all aspects analysed. The trial by Kerley and 
colleagues16 was assessed as being at unclear risk of bias due to its high rate of loss to 
follow-up (12 of 51 participants), although we found no evidence to suggest differential rates 
of loss to follow-up between the intervention and control arms (seven of 24 participants vs 
five of 27).
Overall, in the one-step IPD meta-analysis, vitamin D supplementation resulted in a 
significant reduction in the rate of asthma exacerbations requiring treatment with systemic 
corticosteroids (adjusted incidence RR [aIRR] 0·74, 95% CI 0·56–0·97; p=0·03; 955 
participants in seven studies; table 2). This evidence was assessed as being of high quality 
(appendix p 5). The two-step IPD meta-analysis revealed a similar effect size among 719 
participants in four studies (aIRR 0·69, 0·52–0·92, p=0·01; pheterogeneity=0·56; figure 2). In 
the analyses of the proportion of participants with at least one asthma exacerbation treated 
with systemic corticosteroids, the effect estimates favoured vitamin D but the differences 
between groups were not significant, in both the one-step analysis (adjusted OR [aOR] 0·75, 
95% CI 0·51–1·09, p=0·13; 955 participants in seven studies) and two-step analysis (aOR 
0·69, 0·46–1·02, p=0·06; pheterogeneity=0·74; 719 participants in four studies; appendix p 8). 
Similarly, for the analyses of time to first exacerbation, the effect estimates favoured vitamin

 D but the differences between groups were not significant, in both the one-step analysis 
(adjusted HR [aHR] 0·78, 95% CI 0·55–1·10; p=0·16; 868 participants in five studies) and 
two-step analysis (aHR 0·74, 0·52–1·05, p=0·09; pheterogeneity=0·58; 680 participants in three 
studies; appendix p 9).
We did subgroup analyses to investigate whether the effects of vitamin D supplementation 
on rate of asthma exacerbations requiring treatment with systemic corticosteroids differed 
according to baseline vitamin D status, age, ethnic or racial origin, body-mass index, 
administration of bolus-dose vitamin D, amount of vitamin D administered, and concomitant 
use of inhaled corticosteroids (table 2). We also did exploratory post-hoc subgroup analyses 
by sex and study duration (table 2). Vitamin D supplementation significantly reduced the 
rate of asthma exacerbations treated with systemic corticosteroids in individuals with 
baseline circulating 25(OH)D of less than 25 nmol/L (aIRR 0·33, 95% CI 0·11–0·98; 92 
participants in three studies; within subgroup p=0·046; table 2). Vitamin D supplementation 
did not result in a statistically significant reduction in exacerbation rate in participants with 
baseline 25(OH)D of 25 nmol/L or higher (aIRR 0·77, 0·58–1·03; 764 participants in six 
studies; within subgroup p=0·08). The treatment-covariate interaction term (ratio of aIRRs) 
for this subgroup analysis was 0·56 (95% CI 0·20–1·52, pinteraction=0·25). Quality 
assessments of these within-subgroup effects were downgraded to moderate due to their 
relative imprecision (appendix p 5).
An exploratory analysis testing the effects of vitamin D supplementation in individuals with 
baseline 25(OH)D concentrations in the ranges of 25–49·9 nmol/L, 50–74·9 nmol/L, and 75 
nmol/L or higher did not reveal evidence of effect modification (pinteraction=0·40) or 
significant protective effects of vitamin D supplementation within these subgroups 
(subgroup with baseline 25[OH]D of 25·0–49·9 nmol/L: aIRR 0·79, 95% CI 0·50–1·23 [306 
participants in six studies; within subgroup p=0·29]; subgroup with baseline 25[OH]D of 
50·0–74·9 nmol/L: aIRR 0·76, 0·48–1·22 [334 participants in six studies; within subgroup 
p=0·26]; subgroup with baseline 25[OH]D of 75 nmol/L or higher: aIRR 0·79, 0·37–1·69 
[120 participants in five studies; within subgroup p=0·54]; figure 3). p values for interaction 
for all other subgroup analyses were also higher than 0·05 (table 2; appendix p 7 for end-
study 25[OH]D level pairwise analyses).
Results of the one-step IPD meta-analysis of secondary efficacy outcomes are presented in 
table 3. Vitamin D supplementation reduced the proportion of people with at least one 
asthma exacerbation resulting in emergency department attendance or hospital admission, or 
both (aOR 0·46, 95% CI 0·24–0·91; 955 participants in seven studies; p=0·03). No 
significant effect of vitamin D supplementation was seen on risk of having at least one 
asthma exacerbation as defined in the protocols of primary RCTs (aOR 0·81, 0·58–1·11; 955 
participants in seven studies; p=0·19).
Results of the one-step IPD meta-analysis of safety outcomes are also reported in table 3. No 
participant had hypercalcaemia or renal stones. Vitamin D supplementation did not affect the 
risk of having at least one serious adverse event of any cause (aOR 0·87, 95% CI 0·46–1·63; 
955 participants in seven studies; p=0·66). Only one trial participant died, which was due to 
a road traffic accident.

 A funnel plot for the outcome of rate of asthma exacerbations treated with systemic 
corticosteroids did not suggest publication bias in relation to this outcome because the 
smaller RCTs showed equal spread of results on both sides of the overall adjusted rate ratio 
(appendix p 10). No relation between effect size and study size was apparent (appendix p 6).
Discussion
We report results of the first IPD meta-analysis of RCTs of vitamin D to reduce the risk of 
asthma exacerbations. In the study population as a whole, vitamin D supplementation 
reduced the rate of asthma exacerbations treated with systemic corticosteroids, as compared 
with placebo (0·30 events per person per year vs 0·43 events per person per year; p=0·03), 
and the proportion of people having at least one exacerbation requiring emergency 
department attendance or hospital admission, or both (3% vs 6%; p=0·03). Subgroup 
analyses revealed that reductions in exacerbation rate with vitamin D were statistically 
significant in participants with baseline circulating 25(OH)D concentration levels less than 
25 nmol/L, but not in people with baseline levels of 25(OH)D of 25 nmol/L or higher. 
Vitamin D supplementation was safe at the doses administered: no instances of 
hypercalcaemia or renal stones were seen, and serious adverse events were evenly 
distributed between participants randomly assigned to vitamin D versus placebo.
Our findings from analysing the study population as a whole are consistent with those of our 
recent aggregate data meta-analysis of RCTs of vitamin D for the management of asthma, 
which reported protective effects against asthma exacerbations treated with systemic 
corticosteroids of similar magnitude (IRR 0·64, 95% CI 0·46–0·90).20 The present study 
represents a significant advance because access to IPD has allowed us to do subgroup 
analyses to assess whether specific factors modify the effects of vitamin D supplementation 
on risk of asthma exacerbations. We hypothesised that the protective effects of vitamin D 
supplementation against asthma exacerbation would be strongest in participants with the 
lowest baseline vitamin D status, as has been previously reported for the outcome of acute 
respiratory infection.23 We saw a statistically significant rate reduction in participants with 
baseline 25(OH)D of less than 25 nmol/L, but not in participants with 25(OH)D of 25 
nmol/L or higher. However, the p value for interaction for this subgroup analysis was non-
significant (pinteraction=0·25); formally, therefore, we have not shown that effects are stronger 
in one group than in the other. p values for interaction were also higher than 0·05 for 
subgroup analyses relating to age, sex, racial or ethnic origin, body weight, vitamin D 
dosing regimen, use of inhaled corticosteroids, and study duration. These factors might not 
modify the effects of vitamin D supplementation on exacerbation risk; alternatively, we 
might have lacked statistical power to detect the relevant interactions. Several additional 
RCTs are ongoing (eg, NCT01419262, NCT01728571, NCT02197702, and NCT02424552), 
and, in due course, we hope to include IPD from these studies in an updated meta-analysis, 
increasing the power for subgroup analyses.
Although vitamin D reduced the risk of asthma exacerbations requiring treatment with 
systemic corticosteroids, no significant effect was seen on the risk of asthma exacerbations 
as originally defined in the protocols of the primary trials. In the majority of trials, the

 analysis—eg, encompassing events that resulted in dips in peak expiratory flow rate or 
FEV1 that were not treated with systemic corticosteroids.11,12 Differing efficacies of 
vitamin D supplementation for these two outcomes might suggest that this intervention 
specifically reduces risk of more serious exacerbations. Alternatively, less stringent 
definitions of exacerbation in primary trial protocols might have resulted in a degree of 
misclassification with a consequent increase in noise: signal ratio that might have obscured a 
real effect of vitamin D on exacerbation risk.
Our study has several strengths. The included studies were of high quality, and of sufficient 
duration for steadystate 25(OH)D concentrations to be attained among participants randomly 
assigned to receive vitamin D3. The proportion of randomly assigned participants with 
missing outcome data was small (2·4%), and 25(OH)D concentrations were measured using 
validated assays in laboratories that participated in external quality assessment schemes. The 
analysis contained participants with diverse characteristics in multiple settings, incorporating 
new data from a trial16 done in children with severe asthma that was published after the date 
of the final literature search for our previous aggregate data meta-analysis.20 Our findings 
therefore have a high degree of internal and external validity.
Our study also has some limitations. We did not obtain IPD for one eligible trial;13 however, 
this study was relatively small (n=100) and has previously been assessed as being at high 
risk of bias.20 Notably, this study reported strong protective effects of vitamin D against 
asthma exacerbation;13 as such, if exclusion of its findings leads to a bias, it is likely to be a 
bias towards the null. Interpretation of the funnel plot (appendix p 10) is limited by the small 
number of studies included, but the fact that the smaller RCTs showed an equal spread of 
results on both sides of the overall adjusted rate ratio provides some reassurance that 
publication bias was not a major issue in our meta-analysis; an impression that is reinforced 
by the absence of an association between effect size and study size (appendix p 6). Power for 
some subgroup analyses was limited; this is an inescapable problem in view of the small 
number of published RCTs in this field. Where 95% CI for estimates of effect from 
subgroup analyses were wide, we downgraded our quality assessment of subgroup findings 
to moderate (appendix p 5).
In conclusion, our IPD meta-analysis confirms results from our previous aggregate data 
meta-analysis showing that vitamin D supplementation safely reduces the rate of asthma 
exacerbations overall. However, we did not find definitive evidence that effects of this 
intervention differed across subgroups of patients. In view of the low cost of this 
intervention and the major economic burden associated with asthma exacerbations, vitamin 
D supplementation represents a potentially cost-effective strategy to reduce this important 
cause of morbidity and mortality.

 Research in context
Evidence before this study
Before doing this study, we searched the PROSPERO International Prospective Register 
of Systematic Reviews, ClinicalTrials.gov, and MEDLINE for published or ongoing 
meta-analyses of randomised controlled trials of vitamin D supplementation in people 
with asthma, without language restrictions, from database inception to Sept 30, 2014, 
using the search terms “vitamin D” and “asthma”. A Cochrane meta-analysis of 
aggregate data from double-blind, placebo-controlled, randomised controlled trials found 
that vitamin D supplementation reduced the rate of asthma exacerbations requiring 
treatment with systemic corticosteroids (rate ratio 0·64, 95% CI 0·46–0·90). Whether this 
effect is restricted to patients with lower baseline vitamin D status (25-hydroxyvitamin D 
<25 nmol/L) is not known; an individual participant data meta-analysis could resolve this 
issue, but this has not previously been done.
Added value of this study
Our meta-analysis of individual participant data from 955 participants in seven 
randomised controlled trials provides an updated pooled estimate of the protective effects 
of vitamin D against asthma exacerbations requiring treatment with systemic 
corticosteroids overall. Uniquely, our meta-analysis also investigates whether the effect of 
vitamin D on risk of asthma exacerbation varies according to baseline 25-hydroxyvitamin 
D concentrations.
Implications of all the available evidence
Overall, vitamin D reduced the rate of asthma exacerbations treated with systemic 
corticosteroids, as compared with placebo (0·30 events per person per year vs 0·43 events 
per person per year; p=0·03). Subgroup analysis revealed that vitamin D reduced the rate 
of asthma exacerbations treated with systemic corticosteroids in people with a baseline 
25-hydroxyvitamin D of less than 25 nmol/L (0·19 events per person per year vs 0·42 
events per person per year; p=0·046), but vitamin D supplementation did not result in a 
statistically significant reduction in exacerbation rate in participants with baseline 25-
hydroxyvitamin D of 25 nmol/L or higher. We did not find definitive evidence that effects 
of this intervention differed across subgroups of patients.

Weights are from the random-effects analysis. No asthma exacerbations requiring treatment 
with systemic corticosteroids arose in the trials by Urashima and colleagues9 and Majak and 
colleagues.10 Only one such event arose in the trial by Tachimoto and colleagues;14 as 
such, an adjusted incidence rate ratio could not be calculated for this study.
