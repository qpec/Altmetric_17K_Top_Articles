V
enous thromboembolism (VTE) represents the most pre-
ventable cause of morbidity and mortality in hospitalized
patients,1 and the Agency for Healthcare Research and
Quality (AHRQ) suggests appropriate VTE prophylaxis as a top pa-
tient safety practice.2 The burden of operative and nonoperative
emergency general surgery (EGS) is increasing and represents 7%
of all hospital admissions in the United States. The reported rate of
VTE among patients undergoing EGS is approximately 2.5%.3
Numerous observational studies,4 quality improvement
studies,5randomizedclinicaltrials,6reviews,7andpracticemanage-
ment guidelines8 are available to guide acute care surgeons in VTE
preventionforpatientswithtrauma.However,littleguidanceisavail-
able for the emergency general surgeon. Patients undergoing EGS
represent a challenge regarding VTE prevention.9 Despite the sub-
stantialnumberofannualEGSadmissions,littleisknownaboutthe
risk of VTE or the use of mechanical and/or pharmacologic prophy-
laxisinEGSpatients.Furthermore,althoughguidelinesforVTEpro-
phylaxis are available,10,11 they are difficult to interpret in the con-
textofadmissiontoanEGSserviceforanacutecondition,particularly
when admissions to such services include as many as 70% of pa-
tients who do not require operative intervention.9 The purpose of
this narrative review is to apply the existing literature on VTE pro-
phylaxis to this challenging group of EGS patients and offer recom-
mendations using the best available evidence.

IMPORTANCE Venous thromboembolism (VTE) is the most preventable cause of morbidity
and mortality in US hospitals, and approximately 2.5% of emergency general surgery (EGS)
patients will be diagnosed with a VTE event. Emergency general surgery patients are at
increased risk of morbidity and mortality because of the nature of acute surgical conditions
and the challenges related to prophylaxis.
OBSERVATIONS MEDLINE, Embase, and the Cochrane Database of Collected Reviews were
searched from January 1, 1990, through December 31, 2015. Nearly all operatively and
nonoperatively treated EGS patients have a moderate to high risk of developing a VTE, and
individual risk should be assessed at admission. Pharmacologic prophylaxis in the form of
unfractionated or low-molecular-weight heparin should be considered unless an absolute
contraindication, such as bleeding, exists. Patients should receive the first dose at admission
to the hospital, and administration should continue until discharge without missed doses.
Certain patient populations, such as those with malignant tumors, may benefit from
prolonged VTE prophylaxis after discharge. Mechanical prophylaxis should be considered in
all patients, particularly if pharmacologic prophylaxis is contraindicated. Studies that
specifically target improved adherence with VTE prophylaxis in EGS patients suggest that
efficacy and quality improvement initiatives should be undertaken from a system and
institutional perspective.
CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE Operatively and nonoperatively treated EGS patients are at a
comparatively high risk of VTE. Despite gaps in existing literature with respect to this
increasing patient population, successful best practices can be applied. Best practices include
assessment of VTE risk, optimal prophylaxis, and physician, nurse, and patient education
regarding the use of mechanical and pharmacologic VTE prophylaxis and institutional
policies.

Compared with elective surgical patients, operatively treated EGS
patients are at an increased risk of VTE; the risk varies based on the
underlying diagnosis. This underlying risk may range from 0.2%
(appendectomy)19 to 4% (colectomy)20 in addition to patient-
specific factors (eg, a history of VTE). Certain subpopulations, such
as those undergoing EGS for malignant tumors or inflammatory
bowel disease, may be at an even greater risk.21,22 For instance, pa-

of VTE.11 Specifically, the guidelines suggest that a patient with an

 associated costs are also worth considering, particularly when at-
tempting to improve adherence with respect to VTE guidelines or
implementing quality improvement initiatives.39
Because most operatively and nonoperatively treated EGS
patients are at moderate to high risk of developing VTE, there
should be consideration for pharmacologic VTE prophylaxis in all
EGS patients unless an absolute contraindication, such as active
bleeding, exists. This guideline is in keeping with recommenda-
tions by the UK National Institute for Health and Care Excellence
and the American College of Chest Physicians for patients at mod-
erate to high risk of developing VTE (Table 2). Thrombosis
Canada, guided by the Canadian Patient Safety Institute, recom-
mends that all general surgery patients, including EGS patients,
receive standard prophylaxis, including heparin, until discharge
unless contraindicated.40 The choice of unfractionated heparin or
LMWH varies among institutions, and specific recommendations
for EGS patients are challenging to make. Review of the best avail-
able evidence in other patient populations, such as trauma,41 sug-
gests LMWH to be more effective with respect to VTE preven-
tion, with a lower risk of bleeding and heparin-induced
thrombocytopenia than unfractionated heparin. Further benefits
include once-daily dosing, which reduces patient discomfort,
reduces nursing time, and may improve adherence. Because of
these benefits, our suggestion is to prescribe LMWH for all admit-
ted EGS patients.
Finally, if contraindications to pharmacologic VTE prophylaxis
exist, mechanical VTE prevention strategies should be considered
even if the patient is ambulating. A reassessment of contraindica-
tions, such as bleeding, should be performed daily while the pa-
tient is in hospital.
Initiation and Discontinuation of Prophylaxis
The timing of initiation of VTE prophylaxis is an understudied area
particularly in those patients thought to be at high risk of bleeding
because of an underlying diagnosis, such as gastrointestinal tract
bleeding. The safety of early VTE prophylaxis in EGS patients has
not been specifically studied to our knowledge, but safety has
been well accepted in elective surgical patients, which has
resulted in lower VTE rates without an increase in transfusions.42
All EGS patients should be risk stratified at admission, and VTE
prophylaxis (mechanical and/or pharmacologic) should be initi-
ated as soon as possible even if an operation is planned. The need
for transfusions, hemodynamic instability, and a decreasing
hemoglobin level all individually or additively indicate active
bleeding and therefore may preclude pharmacologic but not
mechanical prophylaxis.
In addition to initiating pharmacologic prophylaxis as early as
possible, recent literature has highlighted the need to ensure that
patients do not miss any doses of pharmacologic prophylaxis. In
patients who miss 1 or more doses, the rate of VTE events is
nearly 5-fold higher with a single missed dose.43,44 Doses may be
missed for a number of reasons: patient preference, nursing con-
cerns, drug delivery, or withholding of doses by prescriber before
a planned operation for fear of bleeding.39,45,46 Pharmacologic
VTE prophylaxis should not preclude the safety of most EGS
operations and is regularly given during elective general surgery.
Unless specific regional anesthetic techniques, including epidural
placement, are planned, pharmacologic VTE prophylaxis does not
need to be withheld for any amount of time preoperatively. Fur-
ther challenges arise when prophylaxis is withheld and the opera-
tion is delayed or canceled resulting in patients missing 1 or more
doses.47
Timing of discontinuation of VTE prophylaxis also raises diffi-
culties in EGS patients. We advocate that all EGS patients con-
tinue to receive appropriate VTE prophylaxis for their entire hos-
pital stay even when ambulation is improving. Although
ambulation is overall likely to be beneficial to patients, few data
support its use as primary VTE prophylaxis.36 Furthermore, evi-
dence suggests that a cohort of surgical patients may benefit
from extended VTE prophylaxis after discharge, most notably
patients undergoing pelvic and oncologic operations.48 In these
patients, who remain at increased risk of VTE even after dis-
charge from the hospital, continuing pharmacologic VTE prophy-
laxis after discharge reduces the rate of VTE by half within 90
days.49 No literature currently exists on the risk of VTE after dis-
charge in EGS patients as a discrete population, but it seems rea-
sonable to extrapolate the existing evidence for nonemergency
surgically managed colon malignant tumors to those managed
immediately because of bleeding or obstruction. This topic is an
area that warrants future research within the EGS patient popula-
tion. It is likely that a substantial subgroup of EGS patients are at
risk of VTE after discharge.21

 Prophylaxis Measurement and Adherence
The many challenges of managing acutely ill EGS patients necessi-
tates a systems approach to VTE prophylaxis with engagement of
frontline staff, including surgeons, residents, nurses, pharmacists,
and other health care professionals, in addition to actively engag-
ingpatients.50Becauseoftherequirementtodocumentqualitymet-
rics, many institutions now quantify and record VTE risk at admis-
siontothehospital.Suchmeasuresareoftenlinkedtoadecisionaid
(computerized or paper based) to assist the practitioner in select-
ing the optimal VTE prophylaxis strategy. Studies suggest that the
use of decision support tools increases practitioner awareness and
adherence5,51 and eliminates disparities in care.52 This method re-
lies on practitioners accurately assessing patient risk and prescrib-
ing appropriately but also ensuring that patients are educated and
receive the prescribed prophylaxis.
A few studies14,16,17 have examined quality improvement proj-
ects aimed, in part, to increase adherence with recommendations
for VTE prophylaxis and have demonstrated significant improve-
ments (Table 1). Although limited by the use of physician orders as
a surrogate to determine optimal prophylaxis (as opposed to ac-
tual medication administration records), these studies also high-
lightthegenerallypooradherencerates.53WithinEGS,severalstud-
ies have found improved VTE prophylaxis prescribing from 73% to
86%14 and 35% to 87%16,17 after initiating a quality improvement
initiativethatspecificallytargetsVTEprophylaxis.Onestudy16found
a50%reductioninVTEeventsafterimplementationofaqualityim-
provement initiative.
TheAHRQrecommendsinstitutionsfirstaccuratelymeasuread-
herencetodeterminewhetherthereisaneedforchange.Thismea-
surement requires pursuance by administrators and practitioners
with stakeholder buy-in to actively reduce VTE risk.31 Many strate-
gies are available, including education of patients and practition-
ers, the use of protocols, proformas, or decision support tools built
into the electronic medical record. Accurate measurement before
and after any planned intervention should be undertaken to refine
methods locally. This measurement may take the form of identify-
ingthosewhodonotprescribeoptimalprophylaxisorengagingother
health care professionals in a culture of patient safety to raise con-
cerns when VTE prophylaxis is not prescribed.54-56 Measuring and
improving VTE adherence in EGS patients and other cohorts
remain the most significant challenges with respect to VTE
prophylaxis.
Conclusions
Increased recognition of the relatively higher VTE risk in EGS
patients is required to improve patient safety. A number of factors,
including the patient’
s disease process and the complexity of coor-
dinated care, make EGS patients a challenging group to whom to
provide adequate VTE prophylaxis, and there remain numerous
gaps in the literature. Adherence with VTE prophylaxis is a well-
established quality metric, and many institutions are beginning to
recognize the need for prospective measurement and improving
the culture of safety at the individual and institutional levels. This
narrative review applied the existing literature to a heterogenic EGS
patient population to make recommendations, improve patient
safety and quality of care, and identify avenues for future research.
We recommend using a validated system for risk assessment and
prescribing LMWH for all operative and nonoperative EGS admis-
sions and mechanical prophylaxis if pharmacologic prophylaxis is
contraindicated.
