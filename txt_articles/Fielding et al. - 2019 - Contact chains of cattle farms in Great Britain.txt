Network analyses can assist in predicting the course of epidemics.
Time-directed paths or ‘contact chains’ provide a measure of host-
connectedness across specified timeframes, and so represent
potential pathways for spread of infections with different
epidemiological characteristics. We analysed networks and
contact chains of cattle farms in Great Britain using Cattle
Tracing System data from 2001 to 2015. We focused on the
potential for between-farm transmission of bovine tuberculosis,
a chronic infection with potential for hidden spread through
the network. Networks were characterized by scale-free type
properties, where individual farms were found to be influential
‘hubs’
in
the
network.
We
found
a
markedly
bimodal
distribution of farms with either small or very large ingoing and
outgoing contact chains (ICCs and OCCs). As a result of their
cattle purchases within 12-month periods, 47% of British farms
were connected by ICCs to more than 1000 other farms and 16%
were connected to more than 10 000 other farms. As a result of
their cattle sales within 12-month periods, 66% of farms had
OCCs that reached more than 1000 other farms and 15% reached
more than 10 000 other farms. Over 19 000 farms had both ICCs
and OCCs reaching more than 10 000 farms for two or more
years. While farms with more contacts in their ICCs or OCCs
might play an important role in disease spread, farms with
extensive ICCs and OCCs might be particularly important by

1. Introduction
Pathogen transmission among hosts may occur by a variety of
routes, from different types of direct contact, to indirect contact
via vectors, fomites and the environment [1]. For livestock,
animal movements between farms can be considered to form a

 directional link from the source to the destination farm, which may therefore indicate potential pathways
for direct and indirect transmission of pathogens [2–5]. Conceiving of farms as nodes and animal
movements as edges in network analyses has been well developed in theory [6], and has been applied
to networks of holdings in multiple livestock species [7–12]. Centrality measures can indicate the
importance of a given farm within a trading network [13], and preferential protection, treatment or
isolation of more central, or more influential, farms might enhance disease control measures [9,14,15].
Network measures such as a farm’s degree and strength (the number of other farms with which they
trade and the number of animals traded, respectively) have been associated with infection risks [16].
In a structured population, the transmission of infection depends on the frequency and nature of
interactions among individuals and groups. Cross et al. [17] noted that for a fixed frequency
of movements, an acute disease with a short infectious period encountering a sparse network will be
unable to spread extensively before extinction. However, a chronic disease in the same network might
be able to persist and disseminate more widely, if it has a long infectious period, relative to the
frequency of between-group interactions [17]. Therefore, investigation of such networks requires
consideration of the temporal aspects of infectiousness of the pathogen, relative to the frequency of
movements [18]. Static network analyses can be particularly useful in evaluating disease transmission
where this period of risk is quantified on the same temporal scale as the network [19–21]. For
example, in studying transmission of foot and mouth disease virus (FMDV), which has an incubation
period of a few days [22], networks encompassing one week of movements are appropriate. But, for a
chronic infection such as bovine tuberculosis (bTB), infection can be asymptomatic or latent for
months to years [23,24], and a longer-term perspective is required. In reality, the edge of a static
network permanently depicts what is truly a transient event, persisting as long as infection does,
either in the incoming animal, a contaminated environment, or via secondary infections in other
livestock or wildlife. It has been shown, in networks constructed from movements of adult dairy
cows, that analysis of groups of statically connected nodes consistently overestimated the epidemic
size of highly transmissible diseases, whereas measures that took into account the temporal order of
movements provided a lower and more realistic estimate [25,26]. The concept of contact or infection
chains has been reasonably well developed in the field of veterinary epidemiology [7,27,28] and the
wider literature contains many examples of essentially the same approach, such as time-directed paths
[29], source counts [30], accessible worlds [31], output domains [25] and reachability [8,32,33]. All of these
terms describe a temporally sequential network to identify the nodes that are accessible through edges
to/from each index node within a selected time period. In this study, we have used the term contact
chain for consistency with the current literature in our field. Ingoing contact chains (ICCs) identify the
number of farms that could potentially transmit infection to the index farm over a defined period arising
from the purchase and importation of animals. Outgoing contact chains (OCCs) quantify the number of
‘downstream’ farms that could potentially acquire infection from the index farm through its onward sale
and export of animals. This structure of contacts may therefore help to predict the risk of the index
farm acquiring and then passing on infection and to characterize patterns of risk across a national herd.
Of course, not all movements result in the transmission of infection; at least one animal moved per edge
must be infected and have the prospect of becoming infectious, to have a chance of infecting animals on
other farms down the chain. Crucially, in our study we do not explicitly model transmission of
infection and we use the term ‘contact’ chain, rather than ‘infection’ chain, representing only the
potential for infection spread. For infections that can effectively be clinically hidden, such as bTB, contact
chains can provide a scale, extent and map of potential transmission routes, which may improve our
understanding of epidemiology beyond that available through studying direct contacts. In a 5-year
study of the French cattle movement network, where bTB is rare (relative to the UK), farms in the
highest quartile of ICCs traded indirectly with up to 84% of farms in the network [34]. It was shown
that these farms in the highest quartile of ICCs were more likely to experience a bTB outbreak [34],
suggesting a link between the connectedness of farms through the purchase of animals and their risk of
acquiring this chronic infection. Similarly, the magnitude of ICCs has been associated with the risk of
acquiring an acute infection, bovine coronavirus, on Swedish cattle farms [35].
The cattle industry in Great Britain relies heavily on trade in animals among beef and dairy
producers. Trading occurs privately, through a dealer or via livestock markets [36] and each
movement of a bovine animal is recorded by a national Cattle Tracing System. These records have
been used to study both network structure and cattle demographics [37]; Green et al. [38] analysed the
initial spread of the FMDV outbreak in 2001, before movement restrictions were implemented,
revealing that livestock movements could result in widespread dissemination of the virus and that the
timing of virus introduction affected epidemic spread through seasonal fluctuations in movements

 among farms. The susceptibility of a network to infection also depends on its overall connectivity
(i.e. how many sections or components into which it is divided). Heterogeneity in British cattle
movements is predicted to influence disease spread [39] and so we have looked for known
characteristics of farms that align with their trading behaviours. Production type and herd size have
been found to be important in predicting movements among pig [40,41] and cattle farms [7,10] and
have been associated with the persistence of bTB [42]. We predicted variation in network measures
and contact chains, based on herd size, production type and location, and thereby we expect that they
might have varying influences on potential transmission of infection. We use both static and
temporally relevant network analyses in the context of a chronic livestock disease in Great Britain to
provide insight into the dynamics of cattle trading behaviour, investigate potential unobserved
transmission routes and to characterize the important actors and practices within this network. We
performed our network and contact chain analyses annually over an extended period to determine if
changes within the British cattle industry have been reflected in the network structure or individual
farm behaviour over time, and consequently if they might have the potential to affect disease
transmission within the cattle population.
2. Methods
2.1. Population-level analysis
The Cattle Tracing System (CTS) records all movements, births and deaths of British bovines. For our
study, the Animal and Plant Health Agency provided a cleaned, processed version of CTS data (see
[43]) on the recorded movements of cattle between locations in Britain from 1 January 2001, when
recording became mandatory [43], to 31 December 2015. Data consisted of 158 million individual
animal movements between premises. We removed births (41 million) and deaths (42 million) from
the dataset and aggregated individual animal movements into batch movements of animals moved
between the same farms on the same day. We included only animal holdings (farms) in this study,
omitting 34 million movements to slaughterhouses as they represent sinks in the network where no
epidemiologically significant transmission could occur. Twenty-six million movements (35%) took
place via markets or show grounds; we classed these as transitory and linked them as single edges
from source to ultimate destination, removing the transitory node. Although we acknowledge the
well-documented risks of livestock mixing at showing events and markets [44], and a market’s role in
concentrating and dispersing animals [36], we considered premises that kept animals for longer than
one day to be more relevant for transmission and persistence of slow-spreading infections, such as
bTB. By directly linking the source and ultimate destination, the flow of animals through these
premises remains in the analysis, while allowing us to focus on the farm premises, upon which
opportunities for transmission of infection were most prolonged. We took 12-month periods from 1
January to 31 December for each year between 2001 and 2015 and grouped batch movements into
single links between farms. These processes together left 9.5 million edges in the study network.
Annual herd size was calculated as the mean of the daily number of animals on the farm over the
same 12-month period. We used CTS data to define herd type for each year, defining it by the
predominant classification (beef, dairy or dual purpose) based on breed and then predominant sex
within this classification. Suckler farms were defined by a majority of female beef animals, aiming to
capture those herds where calves are reared by their dams before weaning (cow-calf systems). Dairy
farms were defined by a female dairy majority, identifying herds producing milk commercially.
Fattening units were defined by a male animal majority, identifying herds that did not breed cattle,
but reared them for beef production. Any farms where the breed type or subsequent sex was not
more than 50% were defined as mixed herds.
2.2. Network analysis
We constructed networks in which nodes were defined as unique animal holdings registered as keeping
cattle, and directed edges were defined as a movement of one or more cattle between holdings. Directed
edges were weighted by the number of animals moved to/from the same holdings during the network
year, as we considered the number of animals to be proportional to the risk of a disease incursion,
especially for a disease with low prevalence within herds [15]. Only active holdings (those with a
recorded movement, birth or death in the year of study) were included in each annual network. The

 network timeframe corresponded with previously defined 12-month periods between 2001 and 2015.
Using a full year avoided bias from seasonal variation of movements [45], yet was sufficient for
transmission of a chronic infection [20]. In- and out-degree, in- and out-strength, betweenness, edge
density, degree assortativity, reciprocity, clustering coefficient, average path length, and the giant
weakly and strongly connected components (GWCC and GSCC) were all calculated using the R [46]
package igraph [47]. Definitions of all network measures and accompanying functions are provided in
electronic supplementary material, table S1. We compared measures from the observed networks in
each year to values calculated from directed random networks of the same size and density,
generated using the Erdo
¨s–Renyi model [48] (see electronic supplementary material, Methods).
2.3. Contact chains
We calculated ICCs and OCCs for 1-year periods (starting and ending in January) from 2001 to 2015 using
the R package ‘EpiContactTrace’ [49]. Overall, the effect of seasonal variations in movement patterns [45] on
our contact chains was likely to be minimal as we used a whole year of movements. However, should afarm
have purchased a large group of animals in January every year and calculation of their chains began at the
beginning of January, the chains would never have a chance to ‘build’, as the incoming movements to the
farms from which they had purchased would not be included. Therefore this farm’s ‘true’ chain would only
be apparent in a chain that started in a different starting month, e.g. December. Any such effect could result
in underestimation of the magnitude of the chain for some farms. Therefore, we calculated ICCs and OCCs
starting at consecutive monthly intervals from January 2012 to December 2013, a total of 24 1-year periods
(see electronic supplementary material, figure S1 for schematic). We compared the results from the different
starting months and then combined these 24 1-year periods to create a more robust summary of movements
spanning 36 months (from the start of the earliest chain to the end of the latest), rather than a 12-month
snapshot. We compared the mean, median and maximum number of farms from the combined 24
monthly spaced chains and combined annually spaced chains over the same time period (2012–2014)
using Spearman’s rank analysis. Summary values from both methods were very similar (see electronic
supplementary material), and so our subsequent analysis used the mean of the 24 monthly spaced
chains. For comparison of chains 2001–2015, we used single 12-month chains to reduce computational
load. We set thresholds on a logarithmic scale for the number of farms in chains to aid their description;
0–10 ¼ very small, 11–100 ¼ small, 101–1000 ¼ intermediate, 1001–10 000 ¼ large, more than 10 000 ¼
very large. The maximum number of farms in a contact chain in any 1 year represents the greatest extent
of the potential impact any one farm may have on the network in that year. Correlations between
network measures were randomized to account for non-independence of network data. Temporal
stability of measures was assessed through ranking of nodes and calculating the standard deviation of
mean rank over time [50] (see electronic supplementary material).
To characterize those farms at high risk of acquiring infection (defined as farms with very large ICCs)
or of spreading infection (defined as farms with very large OCCs), or potential ‘superspreaders’ (defined
as farms with very large ICCs and very large OCCs), we used a logistic regression with a binomial error
structure. We performed the analysis using a threshold of 100, 1000 and 10 000 farms (see electronic
supplementary material for ROC values and predicted probabilities). The highest ROC values were
achieved using a threshold of 10 000 farms and so this was used for the final models. Herd type, size
and region have previously been associated with contact chains of cattle farms in Sweden and
Uruguay [7,10] and were therefore used in our logistic regression. We grouped Great Britain into 10
regions for this analysis (electronic supplementary material, figure S10). We tested the full model
using backward stepwise selection based on Akaike’s information criterion (AIC) [51] but found in
every case that the full models had the lowest AIC. We calculated odds ratios and confidence
intervals and performed ROC curve analysis to estimate the model goodness of fit [52].
3. Results
3.1. National herd characteristics
The median number of cattle traded from a single farm to another over the 12-month period was 2
(interquartile range 1–4), and this remained similar across all years, apart from in 2001 when larger
numbers of cattle were moved between farms (median ¼ 3, interquartile range 1–8, max ¼ 3990).
Most cattle holdings (mean ¼ 40 736, 56.8% of all farms) were characterized as suckler herds

 (figure 1). The total number of cattle holdings (number of nodes in the network for which we had
sufficient information to classify the herd type) decreased by 20 840 during the study period, and this
reduction was most evident among dairy herds (figure 1 and table 1). Herd sizes increased over the
study period; dairy herd size increased from a median of 166 in 2001 to 243 in 2015, while the
numbers of animals in other herd types remained more stable (electronic supplementary material,
figure S2). The predominant between-herd flows of cattle were among suckler herds (12%), from
suckler to fattening herds (9%), and from dairy to fattening herds (7%) (figure 2a). Suckler and dairy
farms were the source for 23% and 18% of movements, respectively, between 2012 and 2014, despite
the number of dairy farms being approximately a quarter that of suckler farms. Fattening farms
received the most (21%) movements from other farms and dairy farms received the fewest (4%), of
which most were from other dairy herds. Thirty-five per cent of movements were traded through
markets, often from breeding herds (suckler and dairy) back to suckler herds or to fattening herds
(figure 2b). The number of active farms (those with a birth, death or movement) stayed stable after
2001 (table 1). ‘Isolated’, farms with a birth or death but not participating in the network make up
6.9% of farms (table 1). On average, 34.4% of dairy holdings purchased no cattle in any one year (95%
confidence interval ¼ 31.8–37.1%), followed by suckler farms at 27.0% (23.9–30.1%), mixed holdings
at 22.5% (19.1%–25.7%) and fattening units had the lowest percentage of closed farms at 9.64% (7.5–
11.8%). Farms that did not report any inward movements in a 5-year period (2011–2015), and so
could be considered ‘closed’ within this time, made up 9.6% of herds in the network. This is a similar
value to dairy, suckler and mixed herds at 10.1%, 10.5% and 10.6%, respectively. We found 5.4% of
herds categorized as fattening enterprises were ‘closed’ for that period, suggesting that these were not
typical ‘fattening’ units and that more than one form of enterprise was present.
3.2. Network analysis
The number of edges (created when at least one animal is traded between two farms) in the cattle
movement network was lowest in 2001, after which it stabilized to between 60 000 and 70 000
between-herd links per annum (table 1). Every year, all metrics of the observed network values lay
outside the distribution of values from the random networks (electronic supplementary material, table
S2), showing that all of the observed networks differed from random in a range of key measures. The
density of connections between farms in the network (edge density) increased by over 50% during the
study period (table 1). Degree assortativity was more negative in all years in the observed network,

Figure 2. Relative importance of pathways for cattle movements in Great Britain from 1 January 2012 to 31 December 2014.
Movements are shown as a percentage of 13 910 851 movements over this period. Black arrows represent movements weighted
as a percentage of total movements recorded. Flows of less than 1% are marked by grey arrows. The number of farms in each
herd type is the mean number of unique, registered cattle holdings over the years 2012–2014, also represented by the area
of the circle for each type. Our analyses are based on the characterization of movements shown in (a) which represents cattle
movements among cattle holdings (farms) and slaughterhouses, and where movements made through markets are included as
direct farm-to-farm/slaughterhouse movements. For comparison, in (b), markets are included explicitly as locations, to indicate
the frequency of cattle movements via markets.

 when compared to random (electronic supplementary material, table S2), meaning that farms with low
degree were connected to those with high degree, and vice versa, indicating that some farms act as ‘hubs’
for movements. The reciprocity of edges was 3–4 orders of magnitude higher in the observed network
than that in the random network (electronic supplementary material, table S2), suggesting trading
partners tend to reciprocate buying and selling cattle with one another. Clustering coefficients were
higher, and average shortest paths were shorter, than in the random networks. GSCCs were smaller
than in random networks, with the observed GSCCs containing fewer than half the number of farms
of the random networks (electronic supplementary material, table S2). Together, this suggests that the
observed networks are modular, consisting of multiple smaller groups of well-connected farms, and
therefore displaying small-world-type properties.
Farm measures of movements remained consistent when they were ranked by the number of farms
with which they traded (degree), and the number of cattle moved (strength), between years (electronic
supplementary material, figure S4). This applied to trade both in-to and out-from the farm. Ranks of
more global measures of connectivity for each farm (contact chains and betweenness) were also
consistent between years but showed more variation than local measures (degree and strength)
(electronic supplementary material, figure S4). These results indicate that individual farm movements
tended to stay consistent over time.
Observed degree was highly variable, compared to the random network (electronic supplementary
material, table S2). In- and out-degree of individual farms were positively skewed (skewness ¼ 17.5 and
3.07, respectively; figure 3). Degree had power law exponents suggesting that the network might be
characterized as scale-free, with many farms trading cattle with only a few direct partners and a small
number of farms trading with many direct partners (electronic supplementary material, table S4). The
number of premises from which individual farms buy-in cattle had much greater range (in-degree
range ¼ 0–4346) than the number of farms to which individual farms sell cattle (out-degree range ¼
0–305) (figure 4). The number of animals moved in-to and out-from individual farms also showed a
positively skewed distribution and range that was more marked for the number of animals bought in
(in-strength skewness ¼ 16.3, range ¼ 0–15 359) than the number sold (out-strength skewness ¼ 8.67,
range ¼ 0–6,472) (figure 4). These patterns for degree and strength were consistent across all years.
Larger farms tended to trade with more other farms consistently among years, demonstrated by a
positive relationship between herd size and degree (mean rs ¼ 0.619, 95% confidence interval 0.603–
0.634). Larger farms also traded more animals (mean rs ¼ 0.679, 95% CI ¼ 0.662–0.696). Herd size and
out-degree and out-strength (mean out-degree rs ¼ 0.531, 95% CI ¼ 0.501–0.562, s.e. ¼ 0.014; mean out-
strength rs ¼ 0.587, 95% CI ¼ 0.550–0.624) were more strongly correlated than herd size and in-degree
and in-strength (mean in-degree rs ¼ 0.290, 95% CI ¼ 0.280–0.300; mean in-strength rs ¼ 0.283, 95%
CI ¼ 0.274–0.292). Differences between some herd types in the number of farms that were traded with,
and number of animals traded, were clear. Median in-degree and in-strength were higher for fattening
farms, and median out-degree and out-strength were higher for dairy farms (figure 4).
Betweenness values were positively skewed (skewness ¼ 29.2), with a large group of farms showing
low betweenness scores and a smaller proportion of farms with very high betweenness scores, but no

 distinct differences between herd type (electronic supplementary material, figure S3). Mean betweenness
was much larger in the observed network than in the randomized networks in all years but one, and
median betweenness was much lower. This provides further evidence that some farms, not linked to a
particular herd type, act as hubs within the network.
3.3. Contact chains
Most farms had fewer than 100 farms in their ICC; however, up to 40% of holdings had large or very
large ICCs over a 1-year period, creating a strongly bimodal distribution (figure 5). The bi-modal
distribution was also present for OCCs. The sizes of ICCs and OCCs for individual farms remained
reasonably stable between all study years, though 2001 and 2002 have different characteristics
(figure 6c,d). ICCs and OCCs were both positively skewed (skewness ingoing ¼ 1.85, outgoing ¼ 0.91).
The maximum observed ICC of a single farm encompassed 86% of all British cattle holdings active in
2001 (n ¼ 73 465 farms) and the maximum OCC occurred in 2004, encompassing 43% (n ¼ 34 460
farms) of holdings. Across all years studied, approximately 50% of farms had very small ICCs, while
35–40% had large or very large ICCs (figure 5). More holdings in 2001 and 2002 have very small or
small ICCs, than those from 2003 onwards (figure 6c). OCCs showed a different distribution; in most
years, 50% of farms had very small to medium OCCs, and 50% had large or very large OCCs
(figure 6d). More farms in 2001 and 2007 had large to very large OCCs, and in 2002, fewer farms had
small or very small OCCs compared to other years (figure 6d). Clear differences were evident
between herd types (figure 6a,b), with over 50% of fattening units but only 25% of breeding and
mixed herds having large to very large ICCs (figure 6a). Over 80% of dairy farms, 55% of suckler
farms and fewer than 40% of fattening farms had large to very large OCCs (figure 6b).
There was a weak correlation between ICC and OCC (rs ¼ 0.181, 95% CI ¼ 0.174–0.187, p , 0.001,
n ¼ 76 031) for the mean values calculated from 24 monthly spaced contact chains. This relationship

farms tended to have many farms in their OCC (figure 7b). Suckler herds tended to have more chains
with large ICC and large OCC (figure 7c). Fattening herds had generally high ICCs with clustering at
the low and high end of OCCs (figure 7d) and mixed herds tended to cluster more with low ICC and

ICC over all years from 2001 to 2015 (mean rs ¼ 0.869, 95% CI 0,858–0.879, p , 0.001 in all years).
This was true to a lesser extent between OCC and out-degree (mean rs ¼ 0.768, 95% CI ¼ 0.754–0.782,
p , 0.001 in all years). Over three-quarters of farms that sold animals to between 6 and 10 farms in
the study period had an OCC linking over 1000 farms, and farms that purchased animals from the
same number of farms had a median ICC with 6486 farms. Some farms, despite low in- or out-degree,
nevertheless had many farms in their contact chains (figure 8).

 Logistic regression indicated that fattening farms were overall 9.5 (95% CI 8.7–10.5) times more likely
to have very large ICCs (greater than 10 000 farms in their ICC) than dairy farms (table 2). There were
also regional differences, where farms in the north of England were more likely to have very large
ICCs (table 2). Overall, dairy herds were more likely than any other herd type to have very large
OCCs. However, with herd sizes above 500, mixed and suckler herds were more likely to have very
large OCCs (electronic supplementary material, figure S7). Herds in the north of England and
Scotland were much more likely to have very large OCCs than herds in the east of England (table 2).
Herds with over 500 cattle had an increased likelihood of very large ICCs and OCCs, especially in
non-dairy holdings (electronic supplementary material, figure S7). Again, herds in the north of
England and Scotland were at higher risk of having very large ICCs and OCCs (table 2). ROC curve
analysis showed all models had acceptable to excellent goodness of fit (electronic supplementary
material, figure S8).
4. Discussion
Epidemics can be difficult to control if underlying transmission dynamics are not fully understood,
especially in large networks where potential transmission pathways can be extensive and convoluted.
The 9.5 million edges and approximately 70 000 nodes included in this study show that the British
cattle network is complex, and potential transmission pathways can be extensive. Quantifying the
extent of these chains is an important step in trying to understand the potential transmission routes
for infections.
In respect of their contact chain distributions, British cattle holdings form two groups; those with very
few (fewer than 10) contacts in their chains, and those with very many (more than 1000). Variation in this
measure within a relatively short period could reflect important differences in a farm’s risk of acquiring
and spreading infection, and key opportunities for action at ‘critical control points’ in the network.
Previous studies have reported similarly skewed data in annual cattle farm contact chains in Sweden
and Switzerland [7,32], and ICCs of pig farms in Germany [53]. In our study, contact chains of
individual farms were stable over time; however, larger chains showed some variation.

 Large herd sizes are commonly associated with increased risk of disease [54] and this is often
attributed to large numbers of animals being purchased [42], we found that although there is an
overall positive relationship between herd size and the number of linked farms, numbers of animals
traded and chain magnitude, these relationships varied among herd types. This suggests that there
are other mechanisms, beyond more animals entering the herd, that contribute to the apparent
increased risk of disease in large herds [55]. Dairy, suckler and fattening herds have distinct patterns
of degree and contact chains, indicating that they play different roles in the network. Through the
purchase of animals from many other farms, fattening herds may be more susceptible to acquiring
infection, while being less likely to pass on infection via movements as, clearly, many fattening cattle
move straight to slaughter. Through selling animals to many different farms, dairy farms that become
infected may be disproportionately influential for disease spread in the cattle network, offering a
potential target for control measures [53]. In addition to the established role of markets as a ‘mixing
pot’ for highly transmissible diseases while animals are on site, here we emphasize their part in
facilitating the dispersal of animals to many premises from one source farm, thereby potentially
amplifying the spread of fast and slow-spreading diseases alike. In characterizing farms into only four
groups, we inevitably simplify the diversity of cattle farming operations in the British cattle industry.
Fattening farms represent animals most probably intended for beef production, but we do not
distinguish between premises rearing animals from calves to slaughter weight and cattle ‘dealers’
purchasing store cattle to sell on to other dealers, markets or farms. These differing businesses may
have varying impacts on disease dynamics, where dealers may exhibit properties similar to markets,
in acting to disperse animals to many farms. Farms in the southeast and east of England, where cattle
densities are lower [56], may be less well connected due to fewer chances to trade. Pre-movement bTB
tests are not required for movement within the north of England and Scotland [57] and this may be
responsible for the higher connectivity of their farms.
The cattle movement network in Britain displays scale-free properties, typical of those seen in
movement networks in other countries. The number of cattle farms in Britain has decreased, driven
largely by a reduction in numbers of smaller dairy farms and the formation of larger dairy herds
(figure 1; electronic supplementary material, figure S2). However, similar numbers of cattle were
traded between fewer farms over the study period, resulting in a substantial increase in network
density. Movement restrictions for nine months of 2001, due to the FMDV outbreak [58], account for
low numbers of separate movements (edges), smaller GSCC and low edge density that year
(electronic supplementary material, table S2). However, the restocking of farms from larger batches of
animals after resumption of movements gave rise to the larger number of cattle moved that year [37].
Although it is well documented that the cessation of bTB testing during 2001 [59] contributed to the
spread of bTB [3,60], the increased volume of animals moved could have made a significant
contribution to the subsequent increase and spread of bTB infection. The number of animals in a
batch is likely to affect the risk of farms acquiring or transmitting infection [12], especially for
pathogens with relatively low transmissibility such as bTB. Some studies have combined the number
of animals traded with contact chains [21,32], and this could be incorporated in further analyses.
The density and clustering of the network are mid-range compared with other livestock movement
networks [7,10,12,61], apart from an Italian network which had much lower clustering [9], suggesting
British farms trade in small communities, and exhibit small-world properties. In the British network
after 2004, clustering coefficients stayed stable and, after 2005, reciprocity decreased, suggesting that
although the network becomes denser, it also becomes more dispersed, perhaps due to an increased
propensity to travel further to trade cattle. The pattern of GSCC size in our results reflects that seen in
previous studies [58,62], and the reduction in size seen from 2004 to 2009 is continued in our analysis,
which extends to 2015. Reduction of the size of such key components has previously been associated
with reduced risk of epidemics [15].
A small number of farms in our network act as hubs (nodes with many more direct trading partners
than the majority). Previously, this network role was considered to be fulfilled predominantly by markets
[62], hub farms provide similar linkages in the network that might facilitate epidemic spread by creating
potential transmission ‘shortcuts’ through the network [63]. Negative degree assortativity, similar to
Scandinavian networks, where direct sales between farms, rather than via markets, are the norm
[7,61], combined with highly skewed degree distribution makes this type of network highly receptive
to control measures targeted at hubs, rather than random selection [53]. It may therefore be beneficial
to apply control measures, which have previously been aimed solely at markets, to hub farms as well.
Risk-based trading measures might employ a proxy value for ‘superspreader potential’ that used
network measures, similar to an ‘infection potential’ value [64], a probability of disease ratio [21], or
royalsocietypublishing.org/journal/rsos

13
 selecting a threshold for the most highly connected farms. This value would provide additional
information on which farmers might base their buying decisions. However, it may be commercially
harsh to rate farms in this way, as they have little control over this value beyond their direct
purchases, and some farms even with very few direct trading partners are connected to very large
contact chains (figure 8).
We used contact chains as temporally relevant network characteristics by which to assess the
potential for acquiring and/or transmitting a slow-spreading infection arising from a farm’s trading
network. There are numerous methods by which to achieve similar proxy measures from analysis of
movement networks, such as those used by Fro
¨ssling et al. [21] and Bu
¨ttner et al. [65]. The algorithms
used by Rossi et al. [64] and Konschake et al. [66], allow a very fine scale of analysis, such that each
node has its own infectious period and time of infection. We adopted a broader measure of contact
chains, applied over an extended period of 15 years, to detect how variable farms may be in their
network positions over time and in the context of infections with long incubation and infectious periods.
Although moving an infected animal into the herd presents the clearest risk of disease transmission,
farms have other ‘connections’, including neighbouring farms and contacts via fomites, service providers
and wildlife, any of which might be important for transmission of infections [67–69]. These connections
often occur at a local scale and have varying importance depending on the pathogen of interest. Animal
movements, however, can be implicated at all spatial scales, from 43% of movements which occur within
20 km of the source farm to the substantial number of long-range movements documented in Britain [70].
Animal movements between neighbouring farms are also likely to be underestimated due to local
practices [71]. Here, we have focused on this movement of animals as a potential pathway for the
transmission of chronic infections and suggest that due to the long timescale, infections transmitted
via movements may be more extensive through the network than we expect and that investigations
into direct contacts may not be sufficient to trace the source and reach of some infections. Thus
more extensive contact chains may better guide us to some of the varied sources and transmission
pathways of cattle infections.
By examining networks of cattle movements, we observed two distinct patterns of interaction; many
farms quickly became connected to a large proportion of the national network, yet some remained
relatively isolated. We have shown marked variation between farms, not only in degree and
betweenness but also in the more complex contact chains among British cattle farms, sustained over a
period of 15 years, that has been characterized by change in the industry and recovery from
catastrophic disease outbreaks. Farms that exhibit extremes in ICCs and OCCs fit with expectations of
‘superspreaders’ of infection [72]. The British networks’ scale-free type properties suggest that the
industry may benefit from targeted control of these influential nodes [53].
Risks associated with direct trading partners are relatively easy for farmers to consider. However, the
chains to which they can become connected remain hidden, along with the potential risks of exposure to
infection they bring. By increasing the number of their direct trading partners, farmers are likely to see
large, and sometimes very large, increases in the number of farms in their contact chain. Chains can also
quickly become large, even with very few direct contacts, perhaps leaving farmers who believe they trade
‘carefully’ with a false sense of security. Knowledge of contact chains, and the trading patterns and
history of the farms from which they are buying, might better equip farmers to judge the exposure
associated with their animal trading behaviour. Contact chains allow us to assess a farm’s role within
the network and further investigation should explore their application to target certain farms, herd
types or practices for improved control of diseases.
Data accessibility. Further information and figures supporting this article have been uploaded as part of the electronic
supplementary material. Underlying data consist of every movement of cattle between all farms in Great Britain.
Aside from the size of the dataset, there are substantial issues of confidentiality (locations, trading practices) and
commercial sensitivity in these data. They are collated and managed by Defra, via the Animal and Plant Health
Agency, who grant access to the data with specific permissions for specific studies. In practice, this means that the
data can be used for the stated purpose only, and making the data publicly accessible would not conform to the
licence the authors have been granted to use these data. With the agreement of the journal’s Editorial Office, the
authors will not be able to make the dataset available on this occasion, but encourage readers, referees and editors
to contact the Animal and Plant Health Agency data manager for data access requests. At the time of submission,
the data manager is Andy Mitchell (andrew.mitchell@apha.gsi.gov.uk).
Authors’ contributions. All authors conceived the study, H.R.F. carried out data analysis, T.J.M. and M.J.S. assisted with
