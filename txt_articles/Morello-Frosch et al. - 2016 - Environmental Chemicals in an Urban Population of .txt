Abstract 
24 
Exposures to environmental pollutants in utero may increase the risk of adverse health effects. 
25 
We measured the concentrations of 59 potentially harmful chemicals in 77 maternal and 65 
26 
paired umbilical cord blood samples collected in San Francisco during 2010-11, including 
27 
polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs), organochlorine pesticides (OCPs), polybrominated diphenyl 
28 
ethers (PBDEs), hydroxylated PBDEs (OH-PBDEs), and perfluorinated compounds (PFCs) in 
29 
serum, and metals in whole blood. Consistent with previous studies, we found evidence that 
30 
concentrations of mercury (Hg) and lower-brominated PBDEs were often higher in umbilical 
31 
cord blood or serum than in maternal samples (median cord:maternal ratio > 1), while for most 
32 
PFCs and lead (Pb), concentrations in cord blood or serum were generally equal to or lower than 
33 
their maternal pair (median cord:maternal ratio ≤ 1). In contrast to the conclusions of a recent 
34 
review, we found evidence that several PCBs and OCPs were also often higher in cord than 
35 
maternal serum (median cord:maternal ratio > 1) when concentrations are assessed on a lipid-
36 
adjusted basis. Our findings suggest that for many chemicals, fetuses may experience higher 
37 
exposures than their mothers, and highlight the need to characterize potential health risks and 
38 
inform policies aimed at reducing sources of exposure.

Introduction 
45 
Animal and human studies have linked prenatal exposure to environmental chemicals to 
46 
adverse health effects both at birth (e.g. preterm birth, low birth weight, and birth defects) and 
47 
later in life (e.g., neurodevelopmental defects, cancer, and cardiovascular disease).1,2 Previous 
48 
research using National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES) data found that 
49 
pregnant women in the U.S. are exposed to numerous harmful manufactured chemicals, such as 
50 
polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs), organochlorine pesticides (OCPs), perfluorinated compounds 
51 
(PFCs), industrial phenols, polybrominated diphenyl ethers (PBDEs), phthalates, and 
52 
perchlorate.3 Many of these chemicals were detected in greater than 99% of U.S. pregnant 
53 
women.3 Maternal exposures are of concern because many chemicals can cross the placenta to 
54 
reach the fetal system4 and put the uniquely susceptible developing fetus5,6 at risk for adverse 
55 
health outcomes. Health risks from simultaneous exposures to multiple chemicals are also of 
56 
increasing concern, as co-exposures can have interactive adverse effects.7 
57 
Various factors can influence the extent to which chemicals enter the fetal environment,

including chemical structure, protein-binding affinity, lipophilicity, and placental permeability.4 
59 
A recent review concluded that chemical concentrations in umbilical cord blood are generally 
60 
lower than or equal to those in maternal blood, except in the cases of some brominated flame 
61 
retardants, polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons, magnesium, and mercury (Hg), for which they are 
62 
consistently higher in the fetus.8 However, estimates of maternal-to-fetal transfer efficiency 
63 
varied widely across studies, often spanning an order of magnitude or more for the same 
64 
chemical. The majority of studies reviewed also did not analyze maternal and fetal samples on a 
65 
pair-wise basis, limiting the ability to assess inter-individual variability in transfer efficiency.  
66 
The goal of this study was to better characterize prenatal exposures to multiple 
67 
environmental chemicals among urban, primarily Latina women – a growing and important 
68 
population that is not well represented in larger biomonitoring studies such as NHANES – and to 
69 
characterize individual variability in the transfer of chemicals between mother and fetus. We 
70 
measured concentrations of a broad range of industrial chemicals and metals, including PFCs, 
71 
PCBs, PBDEs and organochlorine pesticides, in paired maternal and umbilical cord blood 
72 
samples collected from a convenience sample of pregnant women participating in the Chemicals 
73 
in Our Bodies Study (CIOB Study, also referred to as the Maternal and Infant Environmental 
74 
Exposure Project). Our research addresses limitations of previous studies of maternal-fetal 
75 
transfer by analyzing maternal and cord samples on a pairwise basis and on a broader array of 
76 
environmental chemicals.

Biomonitoring Program (or Biomonitoring California, www.biomonitoring.ca.gov) and the 
81 
University of California (San Francisco and Berkeley) that measured chemical exposures in 
82 
pregnant women seeking prenatal care at San Francisco General Hospital (SFGH) and their 
83 
newborns. We enrolled 92 women from the SFGH Women’s Health Center prenatal clinic during 
84 
their second or third trimester of pregnancy between October 2010 and June 2011. At the time of 
85 
enrollment into the CIOB Study, the Women’s Health Center served predominantly low-income 
86 
women of color (60% Latina, 20% African American, 12% Caucasian and 8% Asian/Pacific 
87 
Islander) who did not have private health insurance. Women were eligible to participate if they 
88 
were English- or Spanish-speaking, 18 years or older, in their second or third trimester of 
89 
pregnancy and if they did not have a high-risk pregnancy. CIOB Study protocols were approved 
90 
by the Institutional Review Boards of the University of California, San Francisco (10-00861) and 
91 
Berkeley (2010-05-04), and the California Health and Human Services Agency’s Committee for 
92 
the Protection of Human Subjects (10-04-05).  
93 
Demographic information was collected following recruitment and prior to delivery via 
94 
interviewer-administered questionnaire. Maternal blood was collected during labor and delivery 
95 
and umbilical cord blood after delivery and prior to umbilical cord clamping whenever possible. 
96 
Blood was collected in ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid (EDTA)-coated tubes and stored at -20°C 
97 
until analyzed for metals. Blood was also collected in tubes without additives and, within 24 
98 
hours, serum was separated by allowing clotting at room temperature, then centrifuging twice at 
99 
2000 rpm and transferring serum to amber glass vials for storage at -20°C until analysis for 
100 
persistent organic pollutants (POPs).

Chemical Analysis 
102 
We analyzed maternal and cord blood samples for 59 analytes: 15 PCBs, 7 OCPs, 19 
103 
PBDEs, 4 hydroxylated PBDEs (OH-PBDEs), and 11 PFCs in serum and 3 metals in whole 
104 
blood (see Supporting Information for a full list of chemicals). Chemical analyses were 
105 
conducted at the Biomonitoring California laboratories as described below. Method detection 
106 
limits (MDLs) were defined as three times the standard deviation of the blank samples for 
107 
persistent organic analytes in serum samples. For metal analysis, MDLs were defined as 3.14 
108 
times the standard deviation of archived blood specimens with known low-level of analytes. 
109 
PCBs, OCPs and PBDEs 
110 
Our analytical method using gas chromatography/high resolution mass spectrometry 
111 
(GC-HRMS) was previously published9,10 and used in the current study with slight 
112 
modifications. Thawed serum samples (2 mL) were spiked with carbon-labeled surrogate 
113 
standards: nine 13C-labeled PCBs (13C12-PCB-101, -105, 118, -138, -153, -156, -170, -180, and -
114 
194); seven 13C-labeled OCPs (13C12-2,4′-DDT, 13C12-4,4′-DDE, 13C12-4,4′-DDT, 13C6-
115 
hexachlorobenzene, 13C10-oxychlordane, 13C10-trans-nonachlor, and 13C6-b-
116 
hexachlorocyclohexane [HCH]); and nine 13C-labeled PBDEs (13C12-BDE-28, -47, -99, -153, -
117 
154, -183, -197, -207, and -209). Equal volumes (4 mL) of formic acid and water were added to 
118 
each sample before loading on the solid phase extraction (SPE) modules (RapidTrace, Biotage®, 
119 
USA). Oasis HLB cartridges (3 cc, 500 mg, Waters, Inc. USA) and acidified silica (500o C pre-
120 
baked, manually packed, 3 cc) were used for the sample extraction and clean-up, respectively. 
121 
The collected final eluates were concentrated and spiked with recovery standard (13C12-PCB-
122 
209). NIST standard reference material 1589a and bovine serum pre-spiked with known amounts 
123

 8 
 
of target analytes were used as quality assurance/quality control (QA/QC) samples. Blank 
124 
samples (10 times diluted bovine serum) were also processed with each batch of samples. 
125 
We used GC-HRMS (DFS, ThermoFisher, Bremen, Germany) to measure PBDEs and 
126 
PCBs/OCPs in two separate injections. For PCBs and OCPs analyses, we injected 2 µL of 
127 
extracts in splitless mode and separated them using a HT8-PCB column (60 m × 0.25 mm I.D., 
128 
0.25 µm film thickness, SGE International Pty Ltd., Australia & Pacific Region) with helium as 
129 
carrier gas. For PBDEs analysis, we injected 2 µL of extracts and separated them using a DB-5 
130 
MS column (Agilent J&W, USA) (15 m × 0.25 mm I.D., 0.10 µm film thickness) with helium as 
131 
carrier gas. The MS was operated in electron impact ionization mode using multiple ion 
132 
detection. Perfluorokerosene (PFK) was used as the mass reference. 
133 
Hydroxylated PBDEs (OH-PBDEs) 
134 
An off-line SPE sample cleanup was implemented for the analysis of 250 µL serum 
135 
samples for OH-PBDEs, including a 3-hr enzymatic hydrolysis prior to extraction of the 
136 
analytes.11 The SPE was performed using OASISTM HLB, 60 mg, 3 cc (Waters Inc., MA, USA) 
137 
and the chromatographic separation was achieved on a mixed-mode column (Acclaim Surfactant 
138 
Plus, 3 µm, 2.1 mm x 250 mm; Thermo Scientific, Madison, WI, USA). An aliquot of 10 µL of 
139 
the reconstituted sample diluted four times was used for analysis. The analysis of OH-PBDEs in 
140 
serum was carried out on a Prominence Ultra-Fast liquid chromatography system (UFLC) 
141 
(Shimadzu Corporation, Columbia, MD, USA) interfaced with an AB Sciex 5500 Qtrap System 
142 
(Applied Bioscience, Foster City, CA, USA) in triple quadrupole MS/MS mode.

Human serum pre-spiked with known amounts of target analytes were used as QC 
144 
materials (low, medium and high) were processed with each batch of samples. Method and 
145 
solvent blank samples were also processed with each batch and no OH-PBDEs were detected. 
146 
PFCs 
147 
We used an online SPE high-performance liquid chromatography tandem MS (SPE-
148 
HPLC-MS/MS) method.12 Briefly, 100 µL of serum were mixed with 0.1M formic acid, and 
149 
internal standards were added (13C2- perfluorooctanoic acid [PFOA] and 13C4-perflucorooctane 
150 
sulfonic acid [PFOS]), then injected by the online SymbiosisTM SPE-HPLC system (Symbiosis 
151 
TM Pharma system with Mistral CS Cool, IChrom Inc.) to a C18 cartridge (HySphere C18 HD, 
152 
7 µm, 10 mm × 2 mm). After washing, the target analytes were eluted to a C8 HPLC column 
153 
(BETASIL C8 column, Thermo Fisher Scientific) for separation. The eluate was then introduced 
154 
to the MS/MS (API 4000 QTrap, ABSciex) for multiple-reaction-monitoring (MRM) analysis. 
155 
Analytes were quantified using a calibration curve constructed for each batch: regression 
156 
coefficients of 0.98 to 0.99 were generally obtained.  
157 
In-house QC materials were prepared by spiking a known amount of PFC analytes in 
158 
blank bovine serum at low and high levels. Standard reference materials (SRM 1958) from the 
159 
National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST, Gaithersburg, MD), and QC samples 
160 
spiked with known PFC concentrations from the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and 
161 
Prevention (CDC) were used as reference materials. Blank samples of bovine serum 
162 
(Hyclone/GE Healthcare Life Sciences) were also processed with each batch of samples, and no 
163 
PFCs were detected above their respective MDLs.

We analyzed whole blood specimens for total Hg, cadmium (Cd), and lead (Pb), using an 
166 
Agilent 7500cx inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry system with a helium collision 
167 
cell (Agilent Technologies, Inc., Folsom, CA).13 Blood specimens were diluted 1:50 prior to 
168 
analysis with a diluent comprised of 4% w/v of n-butanol, 2% w/v of NH4OH, 0.1% w/v Triton 
169 
X-100 and 0.1% w/v of H4EDTA to minimize blood matrix effects. Intermediate calibration 
170 
standards were prepared from stock standard solutions traceable to the NIST. 
171 
Specimen concentrations were determined using calibration curves established during 
172 
each analytical run, with regression coefficients ≥ 0.998 for each analyte. Each specimen was 
173 
analyzed in duplicate and the final result was calculated by averaging the two. Acceptance 
174 
criteria were based on the relative percent difference (RPD) between the two specimens. The 
175 
average result was deemed acceptable if the RPD was ≤20%. Fewer than 1% of the reported 
176 
samples had RPDs >20% due to issues with sample clotting, especially with cord blood 
177 
specimens. RPDs for these exceptions were <35%, and the average RPDs for Cd, Pb and Hg 
178 
were 11.3%, 3.7% and 6.4%, respectively. RPDs were not considered when analytical values 
179 
were below the MDL. Values were only reported for specimens with concentrations above the 
180 
MDLs, and for specimens with analyte values below MDL levels, these were reported as <MDL.  
181 
QC reference materials were prepared by spiking defibrinated sheep blood obtained from 
182 
Hemostat Laboratories (Dixon, CA, USA) with stock standard solutions at three concentrations 
183 
(low, medium and high). All reference materials were analyzed at both the beginning and end of 
184 
each batch analysis. Four concentrations of NIST standard reference material 955c were 
185 
periodically analyzed throughout the study to assure independent confirmation. In addition, 
186 
method blanks were checked daily for any detectable levels of the analytes of interest.

Cholesterol and triglycerides were enzymatically determined at Boston Children’s 
189 
Hospital (Boston, MA) and the total lipid content calculated.14 
190 
Statistical Analysis 
191 
We examined distribution plots and calculated summary statistics (detection frequency, 
192 
geometric mean and 95th percentile) for concentrations of each chemical in both maternal and 
193 
umbilical cord blood samples. We also calculated the conditional probability of detection in 
194 
umbilical cord samples, given the detection of the chemical in the maternal sample. Some 
195 
chemical concentrations were below the MDL in maternal and/or umbilical cord samples, 
196 
resulting in left-censored data. Therefore, we used nonparametric methods to examine the 
197 
correlation and transfer efficiency between maternal-umbilical cord pairs. We used rank-based 
198 
Spearman’s correlation coefficient to measure the association between paired maternal and 
199 
umbilical cord concentrations, incorporating censored observations by assigning them tied ranks. 
200 
We present conditional probabilities of detection and correlation coefficients for chemicals that 
201 
were detected in at least 20 paired maternal samples in the main text; for the remaining 
202 
chemicals this information is included in the Supporting Information. 
203 
We characterized transfer efficiency by calculating umbilical cord:maternal ratios of 
204 
chemical concentrations among paired samples, conditional on the chemical being detected in 
205 
the maternal sample. We estimated summary statistics of these ratios (percentiles, geometric 
206 
mean [GM] and geometric coefficient of variation [GCV]) using nonparametric Kaplan-Meier 
207 
survival analysis methods.15–17 The distribution of cord:maternal ratios that results when the 
208 
MDL/√2 is substituted for observations < MDL are also provided in the Supporting Information

210 
and the NADA package in R 3.2.2.18  
211 
Results 
212 
Our population consisted primarily of Latina women, and 95% of participants for whom 
213 
we had income data had a combined household income of less than $40,000 (see Supporting 
214 
Information). Two-thirds were foreign-born (about one-third in Mexico). Maternal blood 
215 
samples were successfully collected from 77 women (84% of enrolled) and umbilical cord blood 
216 
samples were successfully collected after 65 of these women (71% of enrolled) delivered their 
217 
babies. Due to inadequate sample volume, only 55 umbilical cord samples were analyzed for the 
218 
full panel of 59 chemicals. 
219 
We detected a median of 25 chemicals in maternal blood samples (range 15-40 or 25-
220 
68% of chemicals measured), and a median of 17 chemicals (range 11-27 or 19-46% of 
221 
chemicals measured) in the 55 umbilical cord blood samples that were tested for the full panel of 
222 
59 chemicals (Figure 1). Eight (14%) of the 59 chemicals analyzed were detected in ≥ 90% of 
223 
both maternal and umbilical cord samples: the OCPs 4,4′-dichlorodiphenyldichloroethene (4,4′-
224 
DDE) and hexachlorobenzene (HCB); the PFCs perfluorononanoic acid (PFNA), PFOS, PFOSA, 
225 
and 2-(N-methyl-perfluorooctane sulfonamido) acetic acid (N-MeFOSAA); and the heavy metals 
226 
Pb and Hg (see Supporting Information, which also includes summary statistics). Ten chemicals 
227 
were detected in maternal but not umbilical cord samples; two chemicals (the PBDE 2,2′,4′-tri-
228 
bromodiphenyl ether [BDE-17], and the BDE metabolite 6′-hydroxy-2,2′,4,4′,5-
229 
pentabromodiphenyl ether [6′-OH-BDE-99]) were detected exclusively in a small number of 
230 
umbilical cord samples (see Supporting Information).

We found that 30 chemicals were detected in at least 20 out of 65 paired maternal 
232 
samples (Table 1). Among these 30 chemicals, the probability of a chemical’s detection in 
233 
umbilical cord serum or blood, given detection in its maternal pair, ranged from 8 to 73% for 
234 
PCBs, 7 to 100% for OCPs, 0 to 68% for PBDEs, 46 to 88% for OH-PBDEs, 81 to 100% for 
235 
PFCs, and 0 to 100% for metals (Table 1). Eighteen (60%) and nine (30%) of these 30 chemicals 
236 
had conditional probabilities ≥ 50% and ≥ 90%, respectively (Table 1). Conditional probabilities 
237 
of detection in umbilical cord blood samples were higher for hydrophilic (median=90%) than 
238 
lipophilic (median=40%) chemicals (Wilcoxon rank-sum p-value=0.004).  
239 
We found that lipid-adjusted and wet-weight chemical concentrations in umbilical cord 
240 
samples were positively correlated at p<0.05 with those in maternal samples for 23 (77%) of the 
241 
30 chemicals detected in at least 20 paired maternal samples (Table 1). Statistically significant 
242 
correlation coefficients ranged from 0.40 to 0.93. The mean correlation coefficient was highest 
243 
for metals (excluding Cd), then PFCs > OCPs > OH-PBDEs > PBDEs (excluding 
244 
2,2',3,3',4,4',5,5',6,6'-deca-bromodiphenyl ether [BDE-197]) > PCBs. Twenty one (70%) and six 
245 
(20%) of these 30 chemicals had correlation coefficients > 0.5 and > 0.8, respectively. 
246 
Correlations between chemical concentrations in maternal and umbilical cord samples were 
247 
higher for hydrophilic (median ρ=0.79) than lipophilic (median ρ=0.53 on a lipid-adjusted basis, 
248 
ρ=0.56 on a wet-weight basis) chemicals (Wilcoxon rank sum p-value=0.04). We also observed 
249 
statistically significant correlation between maternal and cord concentrations of several 
250 
chemicals that were not detected in at least 20 paired maternal samples, including PCBs, PBDEs, 
251 
2,4'- and 4,4'- dichlorodiphenyltrichloroethane (DDT), and perfluorodecanoic acid (PFDeA), 
252 
with coefficients ranging between 0.26 and 0.72 (see Supporting Information Table S4).

We found that ratios between chemical concentrations in paired maternal and cord 
254 
samples varied by chemical class (Table 2, Figure 2). For lipophilic compounds, ratios varied by 
255 
whether they were calculated on a lipid-adjusted or wet-weight basis (Figure 2A). On a wet-
256 
weight basis, we found that median ratios of lipophilic compounds were typically lower than 
257 
one, with median ratios ranging between 0.2 and 0.5 for PCBs; 0.1 and 0.6 for OCPs; and 0.2 
258 
and 0.4 for PBDEs (Table 2). Median ratios on a lipid-adjusted basis were between 0.7 and 1.4 
259 
for PCBs; 0.9 and 1.8 for OCPs; and 0.5 and 1.3 for PBDEs (Table 2). Whether using wet weight 
260 
or lipid-adjusted concentrations, median ratios of PCB and PBDE concentrations decreased with 
261 
the degree of halogenation, albeit not always linearly. For example, the median lipid-adjusted 
262 
ratios of PCB-118 (5 chlorines), -138 and -153 (6 chlorines), -170 and -180 (7 chlorines) were 
263 
1.4, 1.4, 1.1, 0.7, and 0.7, respectively. The median lipid-adjusted ratios of BDE-28 (3 
264 
bromines), -47 (4 bromines), -99 and -100 (5 bromines), -153 (6 bromines), and -209 (10 
265 
bromines) were 1.2, 1.3, 1.0, 0.9, and 0.5, respectively (Table 2).  
266 
Most median PFC cord:maternal concentrations ratios were near or below one (Figure 2 
267 
and Table 2). For carboxylate PFCs, median ratios decreased with increasing chain length and 
268 
degree of halogenation. The median ratio was 1.0, 0.8, 0.4, and 0.3 for perfluoroheptanoic acid 
269 
(PFHpA [C7, 13 fluorines]), PFOA (C8, 15 fluorines), PFNA (C9, 17 fluorines) and PFUA (C11, 
270 
21 fluorines), respectively (Table 2).  
271 
Individual-level variation in transfer efficiency, assessed using the GCV, tended to 
272 
increase somewhat with an increase in the degree of halogenation for PCBs, OCPs, and 
273 
carboxylate PFCs (Table 2). The median GCVs was lower for hydrophilic chemicals (median 
274 
GCV=58) than lipophilic chemicals (median GCV=74 on a lipid-adjusted basis, GCV=71 on a 
275 
wet-weight basis) but the differences were not statistically significant at p< 0.10.

Substituting observations < MDL with MDL/√2 generally resulted in slightly higher 
277 
median cord:maternal ratios and GCVs on both a wet-weight and lipid-adjusted basis (see 
278 
Supporting Information).  
279 
Discussion  
280 
To our knowledge, this is the first study to measure nearly 60 environmental chemicals in 
281 
matched maternal and umbilical cord blood samples in the U.S. We found widespread exposures 
282 
to a mixture of different chemicals in this primarily Latina and largely low-income population. 
283 
All but 12 (21%) of the 56 chemicals detected in maternal blood samples were also detected in 
284 
umbilical cord blood samples, indicating that they passed through the placenta and entered the 
285 
fetal environment, and we observed statistically significant and moderate-to-strong correlation 
286 
between maternal and umbilical cord concentrations for the majority (77%) of chemicals 
287 
detected in at least 20 paired maternal samples. Further, we found that concentrations of four 
288 
chemicals (the PBDE metabolite 5-OH-BDE-47, the PFCs PFOSA and 2-(N-ethyl-
289 
perfluorooctane sulfonamido) acetic acid [N-EtFOSAA], and Hg), were more often higher in 
290 
umbilical cord serum or blood than in maternal samples from the same woman (i.e., the median 
291 
cord:maternal concentration ratios were greater than one). Median cord:maternal concentration 
292 
ratios also exceeded one for many lipophilic compounds (PCB-118, -138 and -153, 4,4′-DDE, 
293 
HCB, and BDE-28 and -47) when ratios were calculated on a lipid-adjusted basis.  
294 
Chemical concentrations in maternal blood samples from our study population were 
295 
generally lower than those measured in a study of pregnant women in the U.S. derived from 
296 
NHANES3 although our sample included more extreme observations (higher 95th percentiles) for 
297 
4,4′-DDE, BDE-47 and BDE-99, and PFNA (See Supporting Information Table S3). Lower 
298

 16 
 
average concentrations among CIOB Study participants are likely due to the differences in study 
299 
periods: the NHANES data were collected in 2003-2004, while our samples were collected 
300 
between 2010 and 2011. Levels of some bioaccumulative compounds are steadily decreasing in 
301 
the U.S. population following regulatory bans and voluntary phase-outs.19,20 For example, bans 
302 
and phase-outs of certain PBDEs have led to declines in concentrations measured in pregnant 
303 
women.9 Differences in measured concentrations may also reflect differences in geographic 
304 
origin of the study populations. Two-thirds of the women in our study were foreign-born 
305 
(primarily from Mexico or Central America), and previous studies indicate that immigrants have 
306 
lower PBDE concentrations compared to U.S.-born women in California.21,22 This may be 
307 
attributable to the state’s unique furniture flammability standard, which has likely contributed to 
308 
higher PBDE concentrations among women who have been in California longer. The use of 
309 
DDT and other organochlorine pesticides was also banned earlier in the U.S. compared to other 
310 
countries in the Americas, which may explain the higher 95th percentile 4,4′-DDE concentrations 
311 
observed in our study compared with pregnant women in NHANES 2003-4.  
312 
In general, we found much higher estimates of maternal-fetal transfer (cord:maternal 
313 
ratios) for lipophilic compounds (PCBs, OCPs, and PBDEs) when ratios were calculated on a 
314 
lipid-adjusted rather than a wet-weight basis. This is due to the fact that the umbilical cord blood 
315 
had lower concentrations of lipids than maternal blood, consistent with previous studies.23,24 If 
316 
one assumes body burden equilibrium in which lipid-adjusted serum measurements correspond 
317 
to concentrations in adipose tissue of the mother and fetus, comparisons on a lipid-adjusted basis 
318 
are appropriate. However, if certain chemical exposures are themselves associated with higher 
319 
lipid concentrations in blood,25 then this may complicate the underlying relationship between 
320 
maternal-fetal transfer of chemicals and lipid adjustment may be less appropriate.26 Moreover, 
321 
Page 16 of 38
ACS Paragon Plus Environment
Environmental Science & Technology
 17 
 
differences in lipid concentrations between maternal and cord blood preclude comparisons of 
322 
transfer efficiency across contaminants, which would need to be done on a molar basis.   
323 
Differences in chemical elimination half-lives and placental transfer efficiency due to the 
324 
chemical structures of the compounds are likely to have influenced the variation in maternal-fetal 
325 
ratios we observed across chemicals. Wet weight cord:maternal concentration ratios of PCBs in 
326 
our study slightly exceeded those in previous studies that have analyzed paired maternal and 
327 
umbilical cord samples.23,27,28  We found that cord:maternal concentration ratios decreased with 
328 
increasing degree of halogenation of PCBs, suggesting that greater halogenation may result in 
329 
lower fetal exposures. At least one other study has found evidence of a similar trend with 
330 
chlorination of PCBs,27 while others have found little evidence of such a trend.23  
331 
Kim et al. (2015) observed a greater accumulation of PBDEs in umbilical cord serum as 
332 
compared to PCBs and other polychlorinated organic compounds and hypothesized that a unique 
333 
transplacental transfer mechanism related to the structural similarity of PBDEs to thyroid 
334 
hormone may account for this difference.29 However, we did not find evidence that trans-
335 
placental transfer of PBDEs was markedly higher than those of PCBs or OCPs. Our findings are 
336 
consistent with the majority of previous studies finding lower transfer of lower brominated 
337 
PBDEs relative to higher brominated PBDEs,30–33 although this also has not been found in all 
338 
studies.29,34 Our estimates of transfer efficiency of the OCPs 4,4′-DDE, HCB, and b-HCH are 
339 
similar to those of a previous study conducted in Mexico.35  
340 
Although we measured generally lower concentrations of PFCs than previous studies of 
341 
maternal and cord serum,24,36,37 our cord:maternal concentration ratios for PFOA and PFNA were 
342 
consistent with those studies. Our finding that cord:maternal concentration ratios decreased with 
343 
the increasing chain length of the perfluoroalkyl carboxylates is also consistent with one 
344 
Page 17 of 38
ACS Paragon Plus Environment
Environmental Science & Technology
 18 
 
previous study of PFOA (C-8), PFNA (C-9) and perfluorodecanoic acid (PFDA [C-10]).36 We 
345 
observed higher cord:maternal ratios for PFOS than were found in previous studies.24,36,37 
346 
Transfer efficiency appears to be higher for more branched isomers of both PFOA and PFOS,36 
347 
but we did not differentiate isomers in our study so we were unable to ascertain whether 
348 
differences in branching may explain the higher transfer efficiency we observed for PFOS. We 
349 
found that PFOSA and N-Et-FOSAA had slightly higher transfer efficiencies than other PFCs, 
350 
which to our knowledge has not been documented before. 
351 
Cadmium was detected in 83% of maternal samples in this study, but not in any cord 
352 
blood samples, although MDLs were the same. This is consistent with prior research indicating 
353 
that the placenta serves as a partial barrier for Cd, perhaps through metallothiopein binding,38,39 
354 
although some studies have detected Cd in cord blood.8 Strong correlations between cord and 
355 
maternal concentrations of Hg and Pb were observed in this study, similar to past work,8 and 
356 
provides further evidence that concentrations in maternal blood taken at delivery are a good 
357 
measure of relative fetal exposures to Pb and Hg at delivery.  
358 
Chemical concentrations were determined using blood samples taken at delivery. It is 
359 
possible that maternal:cord correlations and ratios vary throughout pregnancy due to changes in 
360 
body mass index (BMI), plasma volume expansion (PVE), lipid transfer, bone mobilization, and 
361 
behavioral factors. Previous research found an inverse relationship between weight gain during 
362 
pregnancy and concentrations of POPs in pregnant women.40 Other studies indicate that plasma 
363 
volume during pregnancy progressively increases until 30–34 weeks gestation, when it reaches a 
364 
plateau. This process may dilute chemical concentrations of metals in blood,41 although there has 
365 
been no systematic review of the evidence of such dilution. There is also a redistribution of lipids 
366 
from mother to fetus during the last trimester of pregnancy,34,42 which could result in greater fetal 
367 
Page 18 of 38

 19 
 
exposure to lipophilic compounds during the latter part of pregnancy. We were not able to assess 
368 
the impact of BMI, PVE or lipid transfer on our maternal and neonatal exposure estimates due to 
369 
a lack of data on these measures.  
370 
We used nonparametric methods to obtain unbiased estimates of correlation and central 
371 
tendency in the presence of missing values below the MDL. This results in estimates of transfer 
372 
efficiency that are conservative because they are conditional on detection in the maternal sample 
373 
and in some cases omit cord/maternal pairs where chemicals were detected in cord samples but 
374 
not in maternal samples (see Supporting Information Table S5 for the higher estimates that result 
375 
from the substitution of missing values with the MDL/√2, which allows for the inclusion of these 
376 
pairs). Alternate approaches to analyzing left-censored data include discarding missing values, 
377 
the substitution of missing values with a fixed value, maximum likelihood estimate (MLE), and 
378 
multiple imputation. Omitting censored observations discards valuable information (i.e. that 
379 
missing observations are known to be below the MDL) and leads to biased estimates of central 
380 
tendency.43 Substitution with a fixed value is problematic because the unobserved values are 
381 
likely to be of various concentrations below the MDL. MLE and multiple imputation are 
382 
sensitive to assumptions about the underlying distribution of the data. They are generally not 
383 
recommended when working with less than 50 uncensored observations because of the difficulty 
384 
of assessing whether the assumed distribution is reasonable.43  
385 
Our analysis did not examine the potential health consequences of chemical exposures. 
386 
While human studies have examined health effects for individual congeners or groups of 
387 
congeners of the compounds we studied, to our knowledge, no human studies have examined the 
388 
potentially adverse developmental and reproductive health effects of simultaneous exposures to 
389 
multiple chemicals in utero, which can have greater risks compared to individual exposures, 
390 
Page 19 of 38

 20 
 
particularly for the same adverse health endpoint.44 Exposures to many of the chemicals we 
391 
measured are known to affect similar endpoints, such as maternal thyroid hormone disruption 
392 
(e.g., PCBs and PBDEs)45 and adverse neurodevelopmental outcomes (PCBs, PBDEs, Pb and 
393 
Hg).46 This study, combined with other evidence of ubiquitous exposures to multiple 
394 
environmental chemicals during a sensitive period of development, highlights the need to better 
395 
characterize the potential health risks of prenatal exposures, which would inform policies aimed 
396 
at reducing sources of exposures.

variation). Full chemical names are given in the Supporting Information. 
439 
a Only chemicals detected in at least 20 paired maternal samples are shown. Detection refers to a measured concentration ≥ MDL. 
440 
Paired samples for which chemicals were not detected in either the maternal nor cord sample were excluded. Summary statistics were 
441 
calculated using Kaplan-Meier estimation procedures and are conditional on detection in the maternal sample. That is, a small number 
442 
of pairs for which a chemical was detected in the cord sample but not in its maternal pair were excluded. 
443 
b The number of incomplete pairs refers to the number of paired observations where the measured concentration was ≥ MDL in the 
444 
maternal sample but < MDL in the cord sample. In some cases, it is possible to estimate a median ratio despite the majority of pairs 
445 
being incomplete using Kaplan-Meier estimation.
