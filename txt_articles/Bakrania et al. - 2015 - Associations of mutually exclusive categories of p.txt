Abstract
Background: Both physical activity and sedentary behaviour have been individually associated with health,
however, the extent to which the combination of these behaviours influence health is less well-known. The aim of this
study was to examine the associations of four mutually exclusive categories of objectively measured physical activity
and sedentary time on markers of cardiometabolic health in a nationally representative sample of English adults.
Methods: Using the 2008 Health Survey for England dataset, 2131 participants aged ≥18 years, who provided valid
accelerometry data, were included for analysis and grouped into one of four behavioural categories: (1) ‘Busy Bees’:
physically active & low sedentary, (2) ‘Sedentary Exercisers’: physically active & high sedentary, (3) ‘Light Movers’:
physically inactive & low sedentary, and (4) ‘Couch Potatoes’: physically inactive & high sedentary. ‘Physically active’
was defined as accumulating at least 150 min of moderate-to-vigorous physical activity (MVPA) per week. ‘Low
sedentary’ was defined as residing in the lowest quartile of the ratio between the average sedentary time and the
average light-intensity physical activity time. Weighted multiple linear regression models, adjusting for measured
confounders, investigated the differences in markers of health across the derived behavioural categories. The
associations between continuous measures of physical activity and sedentary levels with markers of health were
also explored, as well as a number of sensitivity analyses.

Results: In comparison to ‘Couch Potatoes’, ‘Busy Bees’ [body mass index: −1.67 kg/m2 (p < 0.001); waist
circumference: −1.17 cm (p = 0.007); glycated haemoglobin: −0.12 % (p = 0.003); HDL-cholesterol: 0.09 mmol/L
(p = 0.001)], ‘Sedentary Exercisers’ [body mass index: −1.64 kg/m2 (p < 0.001); glycated haemoglobin: −0.11 %
(p = 0.009); HDL-cholesterol: 0.07 mmol/L (p < 0.001)] and ‘Light Movers’ [HDL-cholesterol: 0.11 mmol/L (p = 0.004)] had
more favourable health markers. The continuous analyses showed consistency with the categorical analyses and the
sensitivity analyses indicated robustness and stability.
Conclusions: In this national sample of English adults, being physically active was associated with a better health
profile, even in those with concomitant high sedentary time. Low sedentary time independent of physical activity had
a positive association with HDL-cholesterol.

Background
There is increasing evidence that sedentary behaviour,
characterised as any waking behaviour with low energy
expenditure (≤1.5 metabolic equivalents) while in a sit-
ting or reclining posture [1], is strongly associated with a
number of health outcomes [2–8]. These studies have
shown that high levels of sedentary behaviour are associ-
ated with a greater risk of morbidity and mortality,
which is potentially concerning given that most adults
spend the majority of their waking hours (~55 % to ~70
%) engaging in this behaviour [9–12]. In contrast, it is
known that high levels of physical activity, particularly
moderate-to-vigorous physical activity (MVPA), are as-
sociated with improved health, often in a dose–response
manner [13–15]. Sedentary behaviour and MVPA share
a weak inverse relationship and it is possible for an indi-
vidual, over the course of a day, to have high levels of
physical activity and still accumulate large amounts of
sedentary time [16–18].
Previous research has largely focused on the independ-
ent associations of total physical activity, MVPA, light-
intensity physical activity and sedentary time on health
[2–8, 16–27], rather than the interplay between these
constructs. As a consequence, the daily equilibrium be-
tween physical activity and sedentary behaviour, and the
pooled relationship they share with biomarkers of health,
is not fully understood. Although some studies have
started to explore different techniques for quantifying
combined connections and patterns of MVPA and sed-
entary behaviour [28–35], to our knowledge, only one
study based in the USA has investigated the associations
between categories of physical activity and sedentary
time with markers of health [36]. Loprinzi and col-
leagues found that in comparison to adults who engaged
in <150 min/week of MVPA with high sedentary time
(sedentary time > light-intensity physical activity time),
participants engaging in ≥150 min/week of MVPA had a
more favourable cardiometabolic health profile regard-
less of their sedentary status [36], suggesting that regular
MVPA may offset some of the harmful consequences of
a habitually sedentary lifestyle. If verified, this would be
a clinically important message for a large proportion of
the population who may be concerned about the amount
of time they spend sitting.
The aim of this paper is to use the 2008 Health Survey
for England (HSE) [11, 37] dataset to examine and quan-
tify the combined categories of objectively measured
physical activity and sedentary time amongst English
adults and associate these factors to clinically relevant
anthropometric and biochemical markers of cardiometa-
bolic health.
Methods
Study sample
The HSE is a series of national annual surveys designed
to examine the health and well-being of people living in
England [11, 37]. In order to obtain a population-based
sample, these cross-sectional surveys employ a multi-
stage stratified random sampling procedure with post-
code regions acting as the primary sampling unit. The
2008 wave was centred on physical activity and fitness and
sampled 22623 participants [aged ≥2 years]. Six thousand
two hundred and fourteen individuals [aged ≥4 years]
were randomly selected and approached to wear an accel-
erometer. Adults [aged ≥18 years] who had accelero-
metry data available were included in the present
study (n = 2313). Participants provided written informed
consent. Ethical approval for the 2008 HSE survey was ob-
tained from the Oxford A Research Ethics Committee
(reference number 07/H0604/102). Further details regard-
ing this sample can be found elsewhere [11, 37].
Measuring physical activity and sedentary time
Physical activity and sedentary time were measured
using an ActiGraph GT1M accelerometer (ActiGraph
Corporation, Pensacola, Florida, USA) worn on the right
hip for seven consecutive days during waking hours
(except water-based activities) [11]. The ActiGraph GT1M
device was initialised to collect data using one minute
epochs. Accelerometer files were processed using KineSoft
Bakrania et al. BMC Public Health  (2016) 16:25 
Page 2 of 10
 V3.3.76 (KineSoft, Loughborough, UK). Accelerometer
counts were used to calculate the time spent in each in-
tensity band: sedentary behaviour (<100 counts per min
(cpm)), light-intensity physical activity (100–1951 cpm)
and MVPA (≥1952 cpm) [38]. In addition, MVPA time ac-
cumulated in bouts of ≥10 min, allowing for a two minute
exception in the intensity threshold, was also derived.
Non-wear time was defined as any periods of continu-
ous zero counts for ≥60 consecutive min [39]. A valid
day was defined as ≥10 hours (i.e. ≥600 min) of wear-
time. Adults who provided ≥4 days of valid accelerom-
eter data were included.
Derivation of the behavioural categories
For each individual, the average number of minutes per
valid day spent in MVPA, light-intensity physical activity
and sedentary behaviour were calculated. Based upon
other studies [36, 40], the sedentary behaviour-to-light-in-
tensity physical activity ratio (average sedentary time ÷
average light-intensity physical activity time) was used for
the classification of sedentary status. Participants were
then split into quartiles based on this ratio. Given that the
levels of sedentary behaviour in the general population are
predominantly high [9–12], a conservative, data-driven
approach was undertaken and individuals were classified
as ‘low sedentary’ if they resided in quartile 1 and ‘high
sedentary’ if they resided in quartiles 2, 3 or 4. MVPA sta-
tus was classified as ‘physically active’ or ‘physically in-
active’ on the basis of whether or not participants
accumulated at least 150 min of MVPA per week. This
allowed the formation of four mutually exclusive behav-
ioural categories (Fig. 1), which are provided with commu-
nicative names to aid interpretability: (1) ‘Busy Bees’:
physically active & low sedentary, (2) ‘Sedentary Exer-
cisers’: physically active & high sedentary, (3) ‘Light
Movers’: physically inactive & low sedentary, and (4)
‘Couch Potatoes’: physically inactive & high sedentary.
Markers of cardiometabolic health
A trained interviewer recorded height (measured to the
nearest 0.1 cm using a portable stadiometer) and weight
(measured to the nearest 0.1 kg using an electronic
scale) readings [37]. Body Mass Index (BMI) was calcu-
lated as the weight (in kilograms) divided by the square
of the height (in metres). Waist circumference was de-
fined as the midpoint between the lower rib and the
upper boundary of the iliac crest. A nurse measured this
twice to the nearest 0.1 cm using a tape and the mean of
the two readings was used [37]. Non-fasting blood sam-
ples were collected by the nurse for the analysis of high-

 density lipoprotein (HDL) cholesterol, total cholesterol
and glycated haemoglobin (HbA1c). Blood analytes were
assayed at the Royal Victoria Infirmary laboratory in
Newcastle upon Tyne, England. Further details regarding
these variables can be found elsewhere [37].
Contextual variables
The following factors, collected by a trained inter-
viewer [37], were also utilised: age (in years); cardio-
vascular disease index (no cardiovascular diseases, one or
more cardiovascular diseases); fruit and vegetable con-
sumption (0, 1–3, 4–6, 7+ portions per day); ethnicity
(white, non-white); sex (male, female); smoking status
(never smoked, ex-smoker, current smoker); socioeco-
nomic status (national statistics socioeconomic classifi-
cation:
high,
high-intermediate,
intermediate,
low-
intermediate, low); blood pressure medication (no, yes);
cholesterol medication (no, yes); and any other prescribed
medication (no, yes). The ‘cardiovascular disease index’
variable was based on the following physician diagnosed
cardiovascular conditions/events: abnormal heart rhythm;
angina; atrial fibrillation; congenital heart disease; heart at-
tack; heart transplant; heart valve disease; intermittent
claudication; stroke; and transient ischaemic attack.
Statistical analysis
All statistical analyses were conducted using Stata/IC
V13.1 (Stata Corporation, College Station, Texas, USA)
and controlled for the complex survey strategy employed
in the 2008 HSE (primary sampling units, clustering and
survey weights) [11, 37]. Interview weights, which ad-
justed for: household selection; non-response bias; age;
sex; and regional profiles, were applied in order to pro-
duce estimates representing the national population.
Nurse weights (generated from interview weights) were
utilised to further reduce non-response bias arising from
individuals who were interviewed but did not have a nurse
visit. Blood weights (generated from nurse weights) were
utilised to analyse the blood related variables.
Categorical associations
Pairwise deletion was used throughout the study for
handling any missing data. The weighted prevalence [n;
%] of the English adults in each mutually exclusive be-
havioural category were computed. Participant charac-
teristics of the full sample, stratified by each category,
were tabulated. Categorical variables were presented as
proportions [n; %], whereas the continuous variables
were summarised via their means and standard errors.
Univariate linear regression models, with ‘behavioural
category’ as the independent variable, were fitted for the
following assessed health markers: BMI; waist circumfer-
ence; HDL-cholesterol; total cholesterol; and HbA1c.
The ‘Couch Potatoes’ category, representing physically
inactive adults with high sedentary time (i.e. the least de-
sirable group), was selected as the reference category.
Subsequently, multiple linear regression models were
also fitted for each dependent variable with the following
covariates: age; BMI (except in the model with BMI as
the dependent variable); cardiovascular disease index;
ethnicity; fruit and vegetable consumption; sex; smoking
status; socioeconomic status; and accelerometer wear-
time. Models with HDL-cholesterol and total cholesterol
as the dependent variable were also controlled for both
blood pressure medication and cholesterol medication.
Similarly, the model with HbA1c as the dependent vari-
able was controlled for any prescribed medication. All
regression analyses were two-sided where p < 0.01 was
considered to be statistically significant to account for
multiple comparisons.
The following sensitivity analyses, examining the ro-
bustness of the main effects, were also investigated: (1)
missing data in the covariates were imputed using the
behavioural category means (continuous variables: BMI)
and modes (categorical variables: smoking status and so-
cioeconomic status), (2) participants with a cardiovascu-
lar
disease
index
of
‘one
or
more
cardiovascular
diseases’ were excluded, (3) ‘Low Sedentary’ was defined
as residing in the lowest tertile of the ratio between the
average sedentary time and the average light-intensity
physical activity time, and (4) participants were only
classified into the ‘physically active’ categories if they ac-
cumulated ≥150 min of MVPA per week in bouts of
≥10 min. For each sensitivity analysis, the weighted be-
havioural category prevalence and health associations
were reported.
Continuous associations
The associations between continuous measures of phys-
ical activity and sedentary levels with markers of health
were also investigated. Multiple linear regression models
were fitted for each health marker whilst controlling for the
appropriate corresponding confounders as well as both
continuous MVPA time and sedentary status (sedentary-
behaviour-to-light-intensity physical activity ratio). Analo-
gous to the categorical analyses, these regression analyses
were also two-sided with p < 0.01 considered to be statisti-
cally significant.
Results
A total of 2131 adults were available for analysis after
retaining only those individuals who provided ≥4 valid
days of accelerometer data. The four groups were com-
prised as follows: (1) ‘Busy Bees’: n = 385; 18.6 %, (2)
‘Sedentary Exercisers’: n = 743; 36.7 %, (3) ‘Light Movers’:
n = 147; 6.8 %, and (4) ‘Couch Potatoes’: n = 856; 37.9 %.

 Categorical associations
The unadjusted and adjusted categorical analyses are
displayed in Table 2 and Additional file 1: Figure S1.
The adjusted analyses showed that in comparison to
‘Couch Potatoes’
, ‘Busy Bees’ had significantly lower
BMI (p < 0.001), waist circumference (p = 0.007) and
HbA1c (p = 0.003) levels, and higher HDL-cholesterol
(p = 0.001) levels. Similarly, ‘Sedentary Exercisers’ had
significantly lower BMI (p < 0.001) and HbA1c (p = 0.009)
levels, and higher HDL-cholesterol (p < 0.001) levels.
‘Light Movers’ had significantly higher HDL-cholesterol
(p = 0.004) levels.
The sensitivity analyses, including an alternative less
conservative method for classifying sedentary status, in-
dicated robustness and stability. Although the prevalence
in each category varied across the different methods

All analyses accounted for primary sampling units, clustering and survey weights. Unadjusted and adjusted linear regression models were fitted for each
cardiometabolic health marker with the ‘Couch Potatoes’ category selected as the reference group. The adjusted linear regression models controlled for: age; body
mass index (except in the model with body mass index as the dependent variable); cardiovascular disease index; ethnicity; fruit and vegetable consumption; sex;
smoking status; socioeconomic status; and accelerometer wear-time. Models with HDL-cholesterol and total cholesterol as the dependent variable were also con-
trolled for both blood pressure medication and cholesterol medication. Similarly, the model with glycated haemoglobin as the dependent variable was controlled
for any prescribed medication. Bold indicates statistical significance at α = 0.01

 used (Additional file 1: Table S1), the main results from
the primary multiple linear regression models were
largely unaffected (Additional file 1: Table S2).
Continuous associations
The adjusted continuous analyses are displayed in Table 3
and showed consistency with the categorical analyses.
These models, which controlled for relevant confounders
as well as both MVPA time and sedentary status, revealed
that MVPA time was significantly associated with lower
BMI (p < 0.001), waist circumference (p < 0.001) and
HbA1c (p = 0.002) levels, and higher HDL-cholesterol
(p < 0.001) levels. In contrast, sedentary status was signifi-
cantly associated with lower HDL-cholesterol (p = 0.004)
levels.
Discussion
This is the first study to quantify associations of mutually
exclusive categories of objectively measured physical activ-
ity and sedentary time with markers of cardiometabolic
health in a nationally representative sample of English
adults. Overall, adults who engaged in at least 150 min of
MVPA per week, including those with concomitant high
sedentary
time
(‘Sedentary
Exercisers’),
had
more
favourable health profiles compared to physically inactive
individuals with high sedentary time (‘Couch Potatoes’).
Low sedentary time independent of physical activity
(‘Light Movers’) had positive associations with HDL-
cholesterol. These findings were consistent with the sensi-
tivity and continuous analyses.
The approach to categorising the population into one of
four mutually exclusive categories extends previous re-
search using HSE. For example, previous analysis of HSE
has reported associations between both self-reported and
objectively assessed sedentary time with markers of health
in working age and older adults and between MVPA and
markers of health [25–27]. The wider evidence has
increasingly demonstrated that objectively measured
sedentary
time
is
independently
associated
with
markers of cardiometabolic health [16–20, 41, 42], al-
though not all studies have demonstrated this link
[43]. Whilst these previous analyses have adjusted for
MVPA, the associations of sedentary time with health
across physical activity levels are less well understood.
Therefore, this study adds to the evidence by investi-
gating associations of sedentary status with health
across categories of physical activity.
Our findings are in broad agreement with the only other
study to have used a similar methodology [36]. Using na-
tional survey data from the USA, Loprinzi and colleagues
found that in comparison to individuals (aged ≥20 years)
who engaged in <150 min/week of MVPA with high sed-
entary time (sedentary time > light-intensity physical activ-
ity time), individuals engaging in ≥150 min/week of
MVPA had a more favourable cardiometabolic profile
(BMI, waist circumference, C-reactive protein, white
blood cells and neutrophils) regardless of their sedentary
status. [36] Participants in the most desirable group
(≥150 min/week of MVPA with low sedentary time) also
had better HDL-cholesterol, triglyceride and insulin levels.
Similar to our study, participants in the physically inactive
group with low sedentary time had fewer beneficial associ-
ations, although more favourable profiles for triglycerides
and insulin levels were still observed.
Our findings, alongside those of Loprinzi and col-
leagues [36], are also consistent with the emerging evi-
dence that levels of fitness or physical activity may
modify the associations between sedentary time and
markers of health in adults [35, 41, 44, 45], with seden-
tary behaviour only emerging as a determinant of health
in those who are inactive or unfit. Together, these stud-
ies suggest that being physically active may confer some
protection from the potentially deleterious impact of
high sedentary behaviour.
In our study, low sedentary time in the absence of be-
ing physically active (‘Light Movers’) was associated with

 higher levels of HDL-cholesterol (+0.11 mmol/L), suggest-
ing that physical inactivity in a combination with low sed-
entary time may have some positive relationships with
health. However, the potential benefits appeared to be less
numerous and consistent than those observed for physically
active categories (‘Busy Bees’ and ‘Sedentary Exercisers’).
One reason for this could be in the assessed markers of car-
diometabolic health. Although our study included a meas-
ure of glycaemia (HbA1c), more sensitive measures of
insulin resistance, which have shown stronger associations
with sedentary time [6, 19, 20, 46], were not available.
Although sedentary behaviour and MVPA have been
hypothesised to be distinctive health behaviours, it is un-
clear to what extent the underlying mechanisms act
through the same or independent pathways. This reflects
a limitation in the evidence more generally where mecha-
nisms underpinning the benefits of sedentary behaviour
have not been adequately elucidated. To date, the only
evidence-based independent mechanism for sedentary be-
haviour has been through the activation of lipoprotein lip-
ase which has been shown to change by a factor of 10 in
animal models following hind limb suspension [47]. This
supports the observation in our study where low sedentary
time was associated with higher HDL-cholesterol levels,
even
in
those who
were physically
inactive
(‘Light
Movers’). In contrast to sedentary behaviour, acute and
chronic physiological adaptions have been well established
linking higher levels of physical activity to cardiometabolic
health [48–50].
Strengths and limitations
Our study has several strengths and some limitations.
Strengths include; exploitation of a well-characterised
national survey which employs a multifaceted stratified
random sampling procedure; utilising objectively mea-
sured physical activity and sedentary behaviour data; and
a wide range of sensitivity analyses to test the robustness
of our findings. The method used for deriving sedentary
status has both strengths and limitations in itself. In
contrast to Loprinzi and colleagues [36], who used a
pre-defined method for classifying high/low sedentary
time, we took a conservative, data-driven approach. Dif-
ferences between accelerometer characteristics, such as
wear-time, across populations can have a significant ef-
fect on the average sedentary time, artificially inflating
or deflating the number of participants falling within a
fixed threshold. For example, based on the method used
by Loprinzi and colleagues [36], less than 8 % of the
participants in our sample would be classified as ‘Low
Sedentary’
, and only 1.6 % of the population would be
categorised as physically inactive with low sedentary
time i.e. ‘Light Movers’ (data not shown). Therefore,
the approach used in our study ensures that the cat-
egories are determined in relation to the population
characteristics and not influenced by measurement artefact.
However, the corresponding limitation is that specific tar-
gets for intervention are difficult to define. Additional per-
tinent limitations that are applicable to our study include
the cross-sectional design which prohibits the possibility of
establishing causality (reverse-causality remains open) or
that unmeasured variables were confounding observed
associations.
Other
factors
which
may
limit
the
generalizability of the findings include: the relatively small
sample size for a national survey; the ethnically heteroge-
neous white population; non-fasting measures of HDL-
cholesterol and total cholesterol; and moderately high
proportions of missing data in the blood analytes, particu-
larly for HbA1c. Furthermore, a larger sample would have
allowed for more dose–response categories. Lastly, our ac-
celerometer data are based on classifying horizontal move-
ment intensity and cannot distinguish between different
postures (i.e. sitting and standing).
Conclusions
In conclusion, we demonstrate that in comparison to
adults who are physically inactive with high sedentary
time, those who are physically active have a more desir-
able
health
profile
across
multiple
cardiometabolic
markers even when combined with high sedentary time.
In contrast, low sedentary time in the absence of phys-
ical activity is associated with higher HDL-cholesterol
levels. By suggesting that being physically active may off-
set some of the deleterious consequences of a routinely
sedentary lifestyle, this study further emphasises the im-
portance of physical activity in the promotion and main-
tenance of health. However, given the observational
design, the interaction and relative magnitude of effect of
physical activity and sedentary behaviour on health needs
further elucidation through experimental research in
order to better inform public health policy and guidance.
