 Neural consequences of post-exertion malaise in Myalgic
Encephalomyelitis/Chronic Fatigue Syndrome.
Abstract
Post exertion malaise is one of the most debilitating aspects of Myalgic Encephalomyelitis/Chronic Fatigue
Syndrome, yet the neurobiological consequences are largely unexplored. The objective of the study was to
determine the neural consequences of acute exercise using functional brain imaging. Fifteen female Myalgic
Encephalomyelitis/Chronic Fatigue Syndrome patients and 15 healthy female controls completed 30 min of
submaximal exercise (70% of peak heart rate) on a cycle ergometer. Symptom assessments (e.g. fatigue, pain,
mood) and brain imaging data were collected one week prior to and 24 h following exercise. Functional brain
images were obtained during performance of: 1) a fatiguing cognitive task – the Paced Auditory Serial
Addition Task, 2) a non-fatiguing cognitive task – simple number recognition, and 3) a non-fatiguing motor
task – finger tapping. Symptom and exercise data were analyzed using independent samples t-tests. Cognitive
performance data were analyzed using mixed-model analysis of variance with repeated measures. Brain
responses to fatiguing and non-fatiguing tasks were analyzed using linear mixed effects with cluster-wise
(101-voxels) alpha of 0.05. Myalgic Encephalomyelitis/Chronic Fatigue Syndrome patients reported large
symptom changes compared to controls (effect size ≥0.8, p < 0.05). Patients and controls had similar
physiological responses to exercise (p > 0.05). However, patients exercised at significantly lower Watts and
reported greater exertion and leg muscle pain (p < 0.05). For cognitive performance, a significant Group by
Time interaction (p < 0.05), demonstrated pre- to post-exercise improvements for controls and worsening for
patients. Brain responses to finger tapping did not differ between groups at either time point. During number
recognition, controls exhibited greater brain activity (p < 0.05) in the posterior cingulate cortex, but only for
the pre-exercise scan. For the Paced Serial Auditory Addition Task, there was a significant Group by Time
interaction (p < 0.05) with patients exhibiting increased brain activity from pre- to post-exercise compared to
controls bilaterally for inferior and superior parietal and cingulate cortices. Changes in brain activity were
significantly related to symptoms for patients (p < 0.05). Acute exercise exacerbated symptoms, impaired
cognitive performance and affected brain function in Myalgic Encephalomyelitis/Chronic Fatigue Syndrome
patients. These converging results, linking symptom exacerbation with brain function, provide objective
evidence of the detrimental neurophysiological effects of post-exertion malaise.

 1. Introduction
Post-exertion malaise (PEM) is a debilitating condition and a
central characteristic of Myalgic Encephalomyelitis/Chronic Fati-
gue Syndrome (ME/CFS) (Institute of Medicine (U.S.). Committee
on the Diagnostic Criteria for Myalgic Encephalomyelitis and
Institute of Medicine (U.S.). Board on the Health of Select
Populations, 2015). Characterized by symptom exacerbation across
a host of domains (e.g. fatigue, pain, cognition), PEM is perhaps the
most incapacitating aspect of this vexing disease (Fukuda et al.,
1994; Carruthers et al., 2003). Unfortunately, the biological mech-
anisms that underlie this phenomenon are not well-understood.
Under controlled laboratory settings, acute exercise has proven
a useful model to study PEM. Both maximal and submaximal exer-
cise protocols have been employed to determine effort-associated
changes across a multitude of perceptual and physiological out-
comes. These studies have demonstrated that acute exercise wors-
ens symptoms of ME/CFS (Nijs et al., 2008; VanNess et al., 2010;
White et al., 2010; Meeus et al., 2011; Meyer et al., 2013; Keech
et al., 2015), alters cardiorespiratory responses to exercise (Cook
et al., 2012; Snell et al., 2013), impairs pain regulation (Van
Oosterwijck et al., 2010; Van Oosterwijck et al., 2011), impacts
immune function markers (e.g. cytokines, compliment c4, natural
killer cells, receptors) (Broderick et al., 2011; Light et al., 2011;
Meyer et al., 2013) and may change gut microbiome interactions
(Shukla et al., 2015). It is clear from these studies that PEM influ-
ences
multiple
physiological
systems.
One
system
that
has
received limited attention with respect to PEM, is the central ner-
vous system (Nijs et al., 2012), particularly brain function.
There is considerable evidence demonstrating that ME/CFS has
both structural and functional brain consequences. Cross-sectional
data have shown that ME/CFS patients have reduced resting brain
blood flow (Yoshiuchi et al., 2006; Biswal et al., 2011), differing con-
nectivity among brain regions (Kim et al., 2015; Boissoneault et al.,
2016; Gay et al., 2016), alterations of whole brain metabolism and
for metabolites such as lactate and n-acetyl aspartate (Brooks
et al., 2000; Siessmeier et al., 2003; Murrough et al., 2010), reduced
gray and white matter volume (Lange et al., 2001; Okada et al.,
2004; De Lange et al., 2005; Puri et al., 2014), increased presence
of white matter lesions (Lange et al., 1999; Cook et al., 2001),
increased neuroinflammation (Nakatomi et al., 2014) and altered
brain function during cognition (De Lange et al., 2004; Lange et al.,
2005; Cook et al., 2007). However, the influence of PEM on many
of these brain-derived outcomes remains unexplored.
The purpose of the present investigation was to determine the
influence of acute exercise on symptoms, cognitive performance
and brain function during both fatiguing and non-fatiguing tasks in
patients with ME/CFS and healthy controls. This study is an extension
of our prior work that demonstrated greater brain activity during a
mentally-fatiguing cognitive task for ME/CFS patients compared to
controls (Cook et al., 2007). We hypothesized that ME/CFS patients
would exhibit augmented brain responses to a fatiguing cognitive
task, but would not differ from controls during non-fatiguing motor
(finger tapping) or simple cognitive (auditory monitoring) tasks (a
replication of our prior work). Further, we hypothesized that exercise
would result in an exacerbation of symptoms, reduced cognitive
performance and further increases in brain activity during fatiguing
cognition for ME/CFS patients but not controls.
2. Materials and methods
2.1. Participants
This study consisted of 15 female ME/CFS patients and 15
female healthy controls matched on age (±3 years), height (±2
inches), weight (±5 lb) and physical activity (based on the methods
of Meyer et al., (Meyer et al., 2013)). Briefly, we paired healthy con-
trols with patients by inquiring about physical activity habits dur-
ing the phone screen interview. Participants were asked to report
their general physical activity patterns and whether they were
more or less active than their peers. Overall, sedentary controls
were sought unless a ME/CFS patient reported being physically
active (n = 2). In this case, a physically active control was chosen
as a match. Participants were recruited for a submaximal exercise,
gene expression and brain imaging study. The data presented here
include baseline characteristics, pre- and post-exercise symptoms,
cognitive performance and brain responses to fatiguing and non-
fatiguing cognitive and motor tasks.
2.2. Inclusion and exclusion criteria
ME/CFS participants were required to meet both Centers for
Disease Control (CDC) (Fukuda et al., 1994) and Canadian Consen-
sus Criteria (CCC) (Carruthers et al., 2003) case definition criteria.
Confirmation of diagnosis was obtained both by a letter from their
doctor confirming that they met both CDC and CCC criteria and
completion of the DePaul Symptom Questionnaire at study entry
(Brown and Jason, 2014). The DePaul symptom questionnaire con-
tains diagnostic algorithms that are based on items meant to rep-
resent case definition criteria of ME/CFS, and the questionnaire was
specifically developed to assess both CDC and CCC criteria (Jason
et al., 2013a). It has also demonstrated good test-retest reliability
and sensitivity (Jason et al., 2015; Strand et al., 2016). Participants
were excluded for: 1) current use of immunomodulatory medica-
tions or antibiotics in the past 6 weeks, 2) self-report or physician
confirmed diagnosis (present) of psychosis, major depression with
psychotic or melancholic features, bipolar disorders, anorexia or
bulimia nervosa; alcohol or substance abuse within the past
2 years, 3) fatigue sufficient to impair functioning or preclude exer-
cise testing (e.g. bed-bound), 4) cardiovascular conditions that
would preclude engaging in submaximal exercise and 5) any con-
traindications for the MRI environment (e.g. ferrous metal in the
body). In addition, controls were required to be healthy and free
from active illness. Controls were asked to indicate their health sta-
tus and ability to exercise at screening and health status was con-
firmed verbally on each day of testing to ensure that neither ME/
CFS nor controls had an acute illness (e.g. common cold) on the
day of testing. Finally, all participants were asked to refrain from
structured exercise for the 48-h period prior to each testing day
and this was confirmed verbally with the participant upon arrival
to the laboratory for testing.
2.3. Experimental procedures
Participants reported to the Exercise Psychology Laboratory at
the University of Wisconsin – Madison for symptom assessment
and for the exercise testing procedures. Functional neuroimaging
procedures were performed at the Waisman Center’s Laboratory
for Brain Imaging and Behavior. Participants completed three days
of testing. Day 1 involved baseline symptom data collection and
functional brain imaging of both fatiguing and non-fatiguing tasks.
Day 2 occurred approximately one-week following baseline data
collection, and consisted of symptom measurement and exercise
testing. Day 3 occurred 24-h post-exercise, and consisted of symp-
tom measurement and a repetition of the functional brain imaging
procedures that were performed on the first day of testing. All
study procedures were approved by the institutional review board
of the University of Wisconsin – Madison and all participants pro-
vided informed consent according to the Declaration of Helsinki
prior to testing.

 2.4. Baseline data collection and symptom assessment
Questionnaires completed at baseline included the: 1) DePaul
Symptom Questionnaire (DSQ; (Jason et al., 2015), 2) Medical Out-
comes Survey Short-Form-36 (SF-36; (McHorney et al., 1994), 3)
Profile of Mood States (POMS; (McNair et al., 1981) and clinical
symptom data. These instruments were intended to characterize
the sample and provide covariate data for neuroimaging analyses.
The clinical symptom data included ratings of the degree to which
participants indicated that the symptoms of PEM, unrefreshing
sleep, muscle pain, joint pain, memory/concentration problems,
headaches, muscle weakness and swollen or tender lymph nodes
were a ‘‘problem” for their illness during the last month. Ratings
occurred across a 1 to 5 likert-type scale (1 = Never a problem;
2 = A mild problem; 3 = A substantial problem; 4 = A severe prob-
lem; 5 = A very severe problem). In addition, the POMS and ten
visual analogue scales (VAS) derived from key symptoms con-
tained in the CDC symptom inventory (ex., fatigue after exertion,
muscles aches, memory problems; see Table 3 for full symptom
list) (Wagner et al., 2005) were administered pre-exercise and
immediately and 24-h post-exercise to measure mood and symp-
tom changes associated with acute exercise (i.e. PEM).
2.5. Exercise testing
Participants completed 30 min of exercise on an electronically-
braked cycle ergometer (Lode Corival, Lode B.V., Groningen, The
Netherlands). Exercise intensity was set at 70% of the participant’s
age-predicted maximal heart rate. Exercise began at 20 Watts and
the intensity of exercise was gradually increased until the
participants reached their target heart rate (HR). Once the target
HR was reached (�4 min), the participants completed 25 min of
steady-state exercise at the target intensity. Exercise intensity
was maintained by making minor Watt adjustments throughout
the 25-min session. Exercise ended with a 3-min active recovery
period at 20 Watts. Ratings of perceived exertion (RPE) and leg
muscle pain were measured at 5-min intervals during exercise
using validated scales (Borg, 1982; Cook et al., 1997).
Measurements of oxygen consumption (VO2), carbon dioxide
production (VCO2), minute ventilation (Ve), HR and work rate
(Watts) were recorded continuously during exercise using a meta-
bolic cart (TrueOne� 2400 Parvomedics, Sandy, UT) and a 2-way
non-rebreathing valve (Hans-Rudolph, Kansas City, MO). The flow
meter was calibrated prior to exercise by making multiple compar-
isons to a three-liter piston syringe. O2 and CO2 sensors were cali-
brated by the presentation of known gas concentrations. Lactate
measurement (Nova Lactate Pro, Nova Biomedical, Waltham, MA)
occurred at minutes 1, 15 and 30 of the exercise session.
2.6. Functional brain imaging procedures
All functional and anatomical magnetic resonance images were
collected on a 3-Tesla GE Discovery MR750 scanner (GE Health
Systems, Waukesha, WI). Following the localizer scan and high-
order shimming, high-resolution functional T2⁄ echo-planar blood
oxygen level dependent images were obtained with an eight-
channel transmit-receive head coil. Functional image acquisitions
were obtained with a gradient echo sequence (TR 2000 ms, TE
25 ms, flip angle 60o) and consisted of 40 sagittal slices with thick-
ness 4 mm and no gap, yielding coverage of the whole brain. The
acquisition matrix was 64 � 64 and the filed-of-view was 24 cm,
delivering an in-plane voxel resolution of 3.75 � 3.75 � 5 mm.
High-resolution T1-weighted anatomical acquisitions (TR 9 ms,
TE 1.7 ms, FOV 24 cm, flip angle 10o) consisted of 128 axial slices
with a matrix of 256 � 256, each 1.2 mm thick.
Functional MRI (fMRI) of the brain were obtained during perfor-
mance of: 1) a fatiguing cognitive task – the Paced Auditory Serial
Addition Task (PASAT), 2) a non-fatiguing cognitive task – simple
number recognition, and 3) a non-fatiguing motor task – finger
tapping (as described in Cook et al., 2007). For the finger-tapping
task, participants were instructed to open and close their right
hand, bringing their four fingers in contact with their thumb, at
the same rate (2 Hz) as a flashing crosshair. For the simple auditory
monitoring task, participants were instructed to listen to a series of
numbers ranging from ‘‘one” to ‘‘ten” and to press a button when
they hear the number ‘‘seven.” Each number was presented for
1500 ms and separated by 500 ms. Both tasks consisted of four
30-s on-periods preceded and followed by 30-s off-periods for a
total duration of 4 min and 30 s. For the auditory monitoring task,
twenty events were presented during each 30-s on-period. Of
these, seven events (35%) were correct targets (i.e., the number
7). Task performance was quantified as the number of correct
responses. Images were viewed through fMRI-compatible fiber
optic goggles (Avotec Inc., Way Stuart, FL). Auditory stimuli (i.e.
numbers) were delivered using a pneumatic headphone system
(Avotec Inc., Way Stuart, FL) using a digital equalizer.
A modified version of the PASAT (Tombaugh, 2006) was used to
induce feelings of mental fatigue during fMRI scanning (as
described in:(Cook et al., 2007)). Participants listened to a series
of numbers ranging from ‘‘one” to ‘‘nine”. They were instructed
to continually and silently add the first number to the second,
the second number to the third and so on and to press the button
whenever two consecutive numbers sum to the number 10. Each
number was presented for 1500 ms and was separated by
500 ms. The task occurred in three separate segments and con-
sisted of three 4-min and 30-s on-periods and five 30-s off-
periods for a total of 16 min. One hundred and twenty events were
presented during each three-minute on-period. Of these, forty-two
(35%) were correct targets (i.e. two numbers summing ‘10’). As a
secondary task, participants were instructed that in addition to lis-
tening to the numbers presented as part of the PASAT, they were to
visually focus on a set of three boxes that contained rapidly (every
500 ms) and randomly changing numbers. The rate at which the
visual numbers were presented was intentionally made too rapid
for any arithmetic and was purely intended to distract and inter-
fere with the primary auditory task, thereby, increasing the com-
plexity and attentional demands of the task and inducing greater
mental fatigue. Thus, the participants were instructed to listen to
the numbers presented through the headphones and perform the
serial addition task on these auditory numbers, while simultane-
ously focusing visually on the numbers scrolling on the screen.
The numbers of correct, incorrect and omitted responses were
measured
using
E-Prime (Psychological Software
Tools,
Inc.,
Sharpsburg, PA) and used to determine task performance. Ratings
of mental fatigue (VAS) were obtained immediately prior to and
following each task block.
2.7. Data processing & analysis
Subject characteristics and self-report data for ME/CFS and con-
trol
participants
were
examined
using
descriptive
statistics,
including the Cohen’s d effect size metric (Cohen, 1988). Cognitive
performance and mental fatigue data collected during scanning
were analyzed using Group (ME/CFS & control) x Time (Pre and
Post Exercise) x Block (1, 2 and 3) mixed model analysis of variance
with repeated measures. Average cardiorespiratory, perceptual and
lactate data during exercise were compared between groups using
independent samples t-tests. Symptom data from pre-exercise to
24-h post-exercise were analyzed descriptively and compared
between groups using effect size estimates and independent sam-
ples t-test.

 Functional brain imaging analyses were conducted using Anal-
ysis of Functional Neuroimages (AFNI) software (Cox, 1996) and all
other statistical analyses were performed with SPSS 22.0. Anatom-
ical images were registered to the Montreal Neurological Institutes
(MNI) 152 template (Mazziotta et al., 1995) using an affine trans-
formation. For functional data, the initial five time points were dis-
carded from functional analyses due to saturation effects. Data
were motion corrected (3dvolreg), de-spiked (3dDespike), slice-
time corrected (3dTshift), aligned to the MNI-152 template with
a nonlinear warp (ANTS WarpTimeSeriesImageMultiTransform),
iteratively blurred to a smoothness of 8 mm full-width, half-
maximum (3dBlurToFWHM) and converted to percent signal
change. AFNI’s 3dREMLfit program was used to perform linear
regression on each participant’s data including separate regressors
for the pre-stimulus countdown, task stimuli (i.e. motor and cogni-
tive), and rating period.
Group-level brain imaging analyses were limited to regions of
interest that were chosen a priori and that were based on our pre-
vious work (Cook et al., 2007). Specifically, we have previously
reported PASAT related brain activity for both ME/CFS and control
participants in cerebellar, cingulate, frontal, insular, motor, pari-
etal, sensory, and temporal cortices, as well as, putamen, thalamus
and globus pallidus. Group differences were found for cerebellar,
inferior frontal and superior temporal cortices, as well as, the hip-
pocampus and thalamus. Further, mental fatigue was significantly
and positively related to activity in cerebellar, cingulate, frontal,
motor and temporal cortices and negatively related to activity in
the superior parietal cortex. Thus, our regions of interest included
1) motor related activity in the pre-motor, primary motor, supple-
mental
motor
and
cingulate
motor
cortices,
thalamus
and
cerebellum, and 2) attention, working memory and executive
function related activity in the dorsal prefrontal, inferior frontal,
ventrolateral prefrontal, supplemental motor, premotor, superior
parietal, inferior parietal, middle and superior temporal, insular
and
anterior
cingulate
cortices,
cerebellum
cuneus
and
hippocampus.
Brain responses to both fatiguing and non-fatiguing tasks were
analyzed using AFNI’s Linear Mixed Effects (3dLME) program with
condition (pre- and post-exercise) and group (ME/CFS & control) as
the independent variables and brain responses as the dependent
variable. To control for multiple comparisons, we thresholded the
statistical map at a voxelwise p-value of 0.01 and applied a
cluster-size threshold of 101 voxels (7101 mm3), corresponding
to a cluster-wise alpha of 0.05 as determined by AFNI’s 3dClustSim.
Following determination of task-related brain activity, linear
regression analyses were conducted to determine relationships
between symptoms and brain responses. In addition, exploratory
relationships between brain activity during the PASAT post-
exercise and metabolic (HR, VO2, VCO2, VE, Watts & lactate) and
behavioral (RPE & leg muscle pain) responses during exercise were
tested. We used data from the final five minutes of exercise for
these analyses as this was representative of a steady-state for both
groups and encompassed the majority of the exercise test. For
these exploratory analyses, we thresholded the statistical map at
a voxelwise p-value of 0.01 and used AFNI’s 3dClustSim to deter-
mine the cluster-size threshold (a = 0.01).
3. Results
3.1. Participant characteristics
Baseline data are listed in Table 1. As expected, the ME/CFS
group was more symptomatic and had overall worse health than
the controls. In addition, 11 of 15 ME/CFS participants reported that
exercise made their symptoms either substantially, severely or very
severely worse, while 4 of the 15 participants reported that exercise
either made them mildly worse (n = 2) or not worse (n = 2). For the
two participants that reported that exercise did not make them
worse, both reported avoiding activities they felt would exacerbate
their symptoms. The other most frequently endorsed symptoms
that were currently impacting patients included unrefreshing sleep
(14 of 15), memory and concentration problems (14 of 15), muscle
pain (14 of 15) and headaches (14 of 15).
3.2. Exercise testing outcomes
Cardiorespiratory, lactate and perceptual data measured during
exercise are listed in Table 2. ME/CFS and controls had similar HR,
respiratory exchange ratio (RER) and lactate responses during
exercise. Although both groups exercised at 70% of age-predicted
maximal HR, ME/CFS patients exercised at significantly lower
absolute Watts and VO2 and reported significantly greater exertion
and leg muscle pain ratings compared to controls (p � 0.05).

 3.3. Post exertion malaise
Symptom changes from pre- to 24-h post-exercise for each item
are listed in Table 3 and the total symptom burden based on the
sum of 10 VAS ratings derived from 10 items contained in the
CDC symptom inventory is illustrated in Fig. 1. As expected, there
were
large
differences
(d � 0.8)
in
self-reported
symptoms
between ME/CFS patients and controls. Twenty-four hours’ post-
exercise, ME/CFS patients reported large (d � 0.8) increases for
the majority of symptoms compared to controls. For controls,
symptom changes were uniformly small (d � 0.3) and often in
the opposite direction (i.e. symptom improvement). When consid-
ering the sum of symptom changes measured (Fig. 1), ME/CFS
patients reported significant increases compared to controls
(t = 3.25, p = 0.003).
3.4. Mental fatigue and cognitive performance
For ratings of mental fatigue, there was a significant main effect
for Time (F = 20.2, p < 0.001) and Group (F = 86.3, p < 0.001) and a
significant Group by Time interaction (F = 5.5, p = 0.005). Both
groups demonstrated increases in self-reported mental fatigue
during the PASAT with the ME/CFS group reporting greater abso-
lute levels and greater changes from pre- to post-exercise (See
Fig. 2). ME/CFS participants reported significantly greater mental
fatigue during both the finger tapping task (F = 26.5, p < 0.001)
and the simple auditory monitoring task (F = 24.2, p < 0.001). For
both finger tapping and auditory monitoring tasks there were also
main effects for Time (Finger Tapping: F = 8.4, p = 0.007; Auditory
Monitoring: F = 24.3, p < 0.001)), but no Group by Time interac-
tions (p > 0.05).
Cognitive performance data for the PASAT are illustrated in
Fig. 3. There was a significant Group by Time Interaction (F = 8.4,
p = 0.007), but non-significant main effects for Group (p > 0.05)
and
Performance
(p > 0.05).
Cognitive
performance
generally
improved for controls both during scanning and from pre- to
post-exercise. The opposite occurred for ME/CFS with a worsening
of performance (i.e. greater errors) across blocks during scanning,
as well as from pre- to post-exercise. There were no significant
main effects or interactions for the simple auditory monitoring
task with both groups demonstrating near perfect performance
both pre- (14.9/15 ME/CFS; 14.9/15 control) and post-exercise
(14.7/15 ME/CFS; 14.9/15 control).
3.5. Brain responses to fatiguing and Non-Fatiguing tasks
Whole brain responses for both ME/CFS and control groups in
response to finger tapping, auditory monitoring and the PASAT
are illustrated in Supplementary Figs. 1, 2 and 3. Data presented
here are limited to our spatial hypotheses and are based on the a
priori chosen regions of interest described in the Materials and
Methods section.
3.6. Finger tapping
There were no significant differences in brain responses to fin-
ger tapping between patients and controls either pre- or post-
exercise (p > 0.05). Further, there were no within group changes
in brain responses to finger tapping from pre- to post-exercise
for either ME/CFS patients or controls (p > 0.05). No significant
relationships between symptoms and brain responses during fin-
ger tapping were observed for either ME/CFS patients or controls
(p > 0.05). Brain responses to the finger-tapping task for ME/CFS
patients and controls are illustrated in Supplementary Fig. 2 and
listed in Supplementary Table 1.
3.7. Auditory monitoring
Prior to exercise, controls exhibited significantly greater activity
in the posterior cingulate (177 voxels) and inferior parietal (122
voxels) cortices during the simple auditory monitoring task com-
pared to ME/CFS patients (p < 0.05corrected). There were no signifi-
cant group differences post-exercise (p > 0.05). Compared to their

There were no significant correlations between symptoms and

Baseline (scan #1) brain responses to the PASAT for ME/CFS

Both groups demonstrated significant activity across several
cognition-relevant brain regions including the thalamus and the
inferior parietal, superior parietal, superior temporal, medial fron-
tal, inferior frontal and cingulate cortices.
Within-group comparisons of brain activity during the PASAT
from pre- and 24-h post-exercise are illustrated in Fig. 5. ME/CFS
patients demonstrated greater activity bilaterally in the inferior
and superior parietal cortices (p < 0.05corrected). Due to the within-
in group nature of this comparison and because fatigue changed
from pre- to post-exercise for the ME/CFS participants, we entered
fatigue as a covariate to determine the effect of the pre- to
post-exercise differences. These differences were eliminated when

 decreases in brain activity from pre- to post-exercise within the
inferior and superior parietal cortices (bilateral), the right supra-
marginal gyrus, left superior temporal gyrus, medial frontal gyri
and the right inferior frontal gyrus. Controlling for fatigue (VAS)
did not substantially change the observed differences.
Group comparisons of brain activity during the PASAT pre- and
24-h post-exercise are illustrated in Fig. 6. Pre-exercise (6a) controls
demonstrated greater activity in the left inferior parietal, superior
parietal and supramarginal gyrus (215 voxels; p < 0.05corrected).
Post-exercise (6b & 6c), ME/CFS patients exhibited greater brain
responses during the PASAT in the mid and anterior cingulate
cortices and the right inferior frontal cortex. As illustrated in
Fig. 6d-f, there was also a significant Group X Time interaction with
ME/CFS patients exhibiting greater changes in brain activity from
pre- to post-exercise compared to controls bilaterally for the infe-
rior and superior parietal cortices, as well as the cingulate cortex.
3.9. Relationships between PASAT brain responses and symptoms of
PEM
Self-reported fatigue (POMS) following exercise was signifi-
cantly and positively related to brain responses in the right inferior
parietal and superior temporal cortices for ME/CFS patients (184
voxels; p < 0.05corrected – See Fig. 7). In addition, self-reported mus-
cle pain post-exercise was positively and significantly related to
activity within
the
left
inferior
frontal
cortex
(102 voxels;
p < 0.05corrected). For controls, self-reported fatigue was signifi-
cantly and negatively related to activity within the right inferior
parietal cortex (120 voxels; p < 0.05corrected) and this relationship
was significant different than that observed in the ME./CFS group.
No other significant relationships were found for the subscales of
the POMS or other CDC VAS ratings.
We also examined the relationship between total errors on the
PASAT and brain activity. For ME/CFS patients, errors were signifi-
cantly and negatively related to activity within the left inferior
parietal cortex (369 voxels; p < 0.05corrected), as well as, bilateral
superior temporal cortices (left: 156 voxels, right: 124 voxels;
p < 0.05corrected). For controls, errors were significantly and posi-
tively associated with activity within the mid- and posterior cingu-
late cortices (167 voxels; p < 0.05corrected).
Exploratory analysis of the relationships between metabolic
and behavioral data during exercise and brain responses to the
PASAT post-exercise did not reveal any significant correlations
for the ME/CFS group. For controls, there was a significant positive

 relationship between heart rate and brain activity during the
PASAT in a large cluster encompassing the anterior and mid-
cingulate cortices. Considering that activity in this brain region
was below baseline during the PASAT, this relationship should be
interpreted as those individuals with the greatest heart rate during
exercise (i.e. the least fit) showed the smallest reduction in cingu-
late BOLD responses during the PASAT compared to baseline. This
is illustrated in Supplemental Fig. 7.
4. Discussion
We sought to examine the neural consequences of acute exer-
cise in ME/CFS using functional neuroimaging methods – deter-
mining brain responses to both fatiguing and non-fatiguing
cognitive and motor tasks. Our results demonstrated that for ME/
CFS patients acute exercise exacerbated numerous symptoms,
impaired cognitive performance and affected brain function. These

 converging results, linking behaviors associated with PEM to brain
function, illustrate some of the potential detrimental effects of PEM
and provide additional support for central nervous system dysreg-
ulation in the pathophysiology of ME/CFS.
Our previous work demonstrated that mental fatigue was sig-
nificantly associated with brain responses to fatiguing cognition
in both ME/CFS patients and healthy controls (Cook et al., 2007).
However, brain responses to non-fatiguing tasks (finger tapping
& simple auditory monitoring) were not significantly related to
mental fatigue for either group. Moreover, ME/CFS patients exhib-
ited greater brain responses during the fatiguing cognitive task but
not the non-fatiguing task. These results suggested that the expe-
rience of fatigue affected neural processing during cognition for
both
patients
and
controls,
with
ME/CFS
patients
showing
increased neural responses. In general, these findings were consis-
tent with results from other groups studying ME/CFS (De Lange
et al., 2004; Miller et al., 2014; Gay et al., 2016), multiple sclerosis
(DeLuca et al., 2008; Tartaglia et al., 2008; Genova et al., 2009;
Huolman et al., 2011) and traumatic brain injury (Kohl et al.,
2009) – all demonstrating detrimental effects of fatigue on neural
processing during cognition. The present investigation extends this
work by stressing the cardiopulmonary and neural systems via
acute exercise and determining the resultant effects on symptoms,
cognitive performance and brain function.

 exercise and symptoms of PEM were the inferior frontal, parietal
and cingulate cortices. These regions are critical for efficient cogni-
tive processing involving processes associated with attention, error
detection, and cognitive control/central executive functions (Bush
et al., 2000; Cabeza and Nyberg, 2000; Shackman et al., 2011;
D’Esposito and Postle, 2015). In general, ME/CFS patients demon-
strated augmented neural responses in these regions following
acute exercise and these brain responses were significantly associ-
ated with symptoms of PEM.
The frontal cortices have been characterized as the central exec-
utive exerting top-down control of cognitive function (D’Esposito
and Postle, 2015). Specifically, the inferior frontal cortex has been
implicated in inhibitory control and task-switching functions, with
damage to these regions interfering with the efficiency of these
processes (Aron et al., 2014). Our results suggest that PEM nega-
tively affects executive function in ME/CFS with greater errors dur-
ing the PASAT as a consequence. The significant and positive
relationship with self-reported muscle pain suggests that those
ME/CFS patients with the most pain symptoms required greater
recruitment of executive control processes to perform the PASAT
or that muscle pain interfered with the top-down control during
performance of a demanding cognitive task.
The cingulate cortex is critically involved in cognition, pain and
emotion signifying its functional overlap among these distinct yet
related behaviors (Cabeza and Nyberg, 2000; Shackman et al.,
2011; Shenhav et al., 2013). For cognitive performance, the cingu-
late cortices are functionally involved in filtering of information,
interference, increased memory loads and monitoring task perfor-
mance (MacDonald et al., 2000; Habeck et al., 2005). We observed
increased activity in the anterior cingulate cortex of ME/CFS
patients during the PASAT from pre- to post-exercise and com-
pared to healthy controls. However, activity within the cingulate
cortex was not significantly associated with symptoms or task per-
formance. It is possible that PEM challenged the patient’s ability to
filter information during the PASAT, thereby requiring greater reli-
ance on the cingulate. Augmented cingulate activity may also
reflect greater monitoring of symptoms during cognitive perfor-
mance (Vogt and Laureys, 2005). Previous neuroimaging studies
of fatigue have reported significant relationships between self-
reported fatigue and cingulate cortex activity (Lange et al., 2005;
Cook et al., 2007; Tartaglia et al., 2008; Kohl et al., 2009). Tartaglia
and colleagues (Tartaglia et al., 2008) reported that MS patients
exhibited augmented brain responses to a ‘‘mentally fatiguing”
PASAT task in several brain regions, including the anterior cingu-
late, compared to controls. Importantly, they tested the influence
of the PASAT task on subsequent brain responses to a motor task
(finger tapping) and found increased activity in bilateral cingulate
cortex (among other regions) compared to the pre-PASAT motor
responses.
A common thread among cognition studies of fatiguing illnesses
is the involvement of the inferior and superior parietal cortices and
the relationships with self-reported fatigue (Lange et al., 2005;
Cook et al., 2007; DeLuca et al., 2008; Tartaglia et al., 2008; Kohl
et al., 2009; Engström et al., 2013). The parietal regions integrate
incoming sensory information from multiple systems (e.g. audi-
tory, visual, tactile) and have well-established functional connec-
tions with the frontal lobe (Andersen et al., 1990; Friedman and
Goldman-Rakic, 1994). As such they have been referred to as the
‘‘posterior attention system” and are integrally involved in cogni-
tive tasks requiring sustained attention such as the PASAT
(Posner, 1990; Cabeza and Nyberg, 2000). We previously demon-
strated that activity in these regions was negatively associated
with the perception of mental fatigue and hypothesized that as
tasks become more fatiguing, the ability to attend to the task
becomes compromised (Cook et al., 2007). Those analyses only
included baseline testing and combined ME/CFS patients and con-
trols. Thus, symptom exacerbation and differential relationships
between ME/CFS patients and controls were not explored. Results
from the present study support and extend this finding by demon-
strating negative relationships between self-reported fatigue and
inferior parietal activity for controls, consistent with our previous
work, and essentially no effect of acute exercise. For ME/CFS
patients, activity in the parietal regions was positively related to
self-reported fatigue and difficulty concentrating, but only post
exercise when symptoms were exacerbated. Moreover, general
patterns of parietal activity during cognitive tasks at rest and
24 h following exercise differed in ME/CFS as compared with con-
trols suggesting that activity in this set of regions may help to dis-
tinguish brain responses in ME/CFS.
4.2. Task difficulty and exercise interactions
Consistent with our previous work (Lange et al., 2005; Cook
et al., 2007), group differences and changes from pre- to post-
exercise appeared to follow a pattern of task difficulty. For the fin-
ger tapping task, no significant group differences were observed
and no changes occurred for either group from pre- to post-
exercise. For the auditory monitoring task, there were small group
differences at baseline with controls showing greater activity in
posterior cingulate and inferior parietal regions, but no group dif-
ferences were observed post-exercise. The most robust group dif-
ferences occurred during the more challenging PASAT task –
transitioning from pre- to post-exercise. For this task, ME/CFS
patients showed greater activity in several brain regions including
the inferior and superior parietal cortices, the supramarginal gyrus,
cingulate cortex and the inferior frontal and superior temporal
cortices.
An important aspect of this study is that brain responses in ME/
CFS patients were significantly related to symptoms of PEM –
including fatigue, pain and difficulty concentrating. For self-
reported fatigue, significant relationships were observed within
temporal and parietal regions with significant differences between
ME/CFS and controls within the right inferior parietal cortex – fur-
ther implicating this brain region as important for integrating sen-
sory and cognitive processes during symptom exacerbation. The
presence of brain and behavior relationships is critical for accurate
interpretation of functional brain data. When present, these rela-
tionships provide objective (brain activity) evidence in support of
the subjective (self-report) experience. Our data suggest that
PEM affects multiple neural processes, particularly those involved
when performing more challenging cognitive tasks.
One of the more striking findings was the magnitude of the
reduction in brain responses during the PASAT for the controls
from pre- to post-exercise. White and colleagues Reductions in
brain responses occurred within multiple regions including pari-
etal, temporal and frontal cortices and suggest that the controls
required less neural resources to quickly and accurately perform
the serial addition task. ME/CFS patients did not demonstrate any
significant reductions in brain responses during the PASAT and
instead showed significant increases in both inferior and superior
parietal cortices post-exercise. These results provide objective evi-
dence that for ME/CFS, PEM affects cognition, having widespread
effects on brain regions associated attention, working memory
and executive function. The pre- to post-exercise reductions in
brain activity for controls were also associated with improved cog-
nitive performance (i.e. reduced errors), which may reflect further
practice effects or greater comfort within the neuroimaging envi-
ronment. Because ME/CFS patients responded opposite to controls,
having greater brain activity, reduced cognitive performance and
increased symptoms post-exercise, these results emphasize the
strong negative impact that PEM can have on the central nervous
system.

 4.3. Exercise and cognition
In general, exercise training and physical activity behaviors are
associated with improvements in brain health and cognitive per-
formance in healthy adults and the elderly (Colcombe and
Kramer, 2003; Hillman et al., 2008; Dougherty et al., 2016). The
influence of acute exercise on cognitive performance is less clear,
but in general reaction times tend to decrease and performance
increases following acute exercise (Lambourne and Tomporowski,
2010; Chang et al., 2012). In ME/CFS, cognitive difficulties are most
consistently reported for the domains of information processing
speed and tasks that challenge executive function (Cockshell and
Mathias, 2010; Jason et al., 2013b). To date, the influence of acute
exercise
on
cognitive
performance
in
ME/CFS
is
equivocal
(Blackwood et al., 1998; LaManca et al., 1998; Claypoole et al.,
2001; Cook et al., 2005). Moreover, much of the neuroimaging lit-
erature examining the relationship between cognitive performance
and fatigue has not demonstrated consistent changes in behavioral
performance (Genova et al., 2013). In the present study, group dif-
ferences in the pattern of cognitive performance were clear. ME/
CFS patients showed increasing errors as a function of both
within-in task performance (i.e. increasing errors with time-on-
task) and as a function of acute exercise (i.e. greater errors 24 h
post-exercise). Controls showed significantly different and charac-
teristically opposite responses that were reflective of the neu-
roimaging data. In general, controls improved as a function of
time-on-task and continued to improve 24-h post-exercise. Physi-
ologically, this was represented by reduced brain activity among
multiple cognitively-relevant brain regions following exercise.
4.4. Exercise, PEM and neuroimaging
Two recent studies by Rayhan and colleagues (Rayhan et al.,
2013a; Rayhan et al., 2013b) are particularly germane to our pro-
ject and highlight the potential for brain imaging methods in the
study of PEM. Testing Veterans with Gulf War Illness (GWI) prior
to and one-hour following two maximal exercise tests, these inves-
tigators reported neural augmentation during a working memory
task in a subgroup of Veterans characterized as the ‘‘Stress Test
Occurring Phantom Perception (STOPP) phenotype” and a failure
to activate the working memory system in a subgroup of Veterans
characterized as the ‘‘Stress Test Associated Reversible Tachycardia
(START) phenotype”(Rayhan et al., 2013b). Similarly, this same
group (Rayhan et al., 2013a) reported differential brain lactate
responses in the prefrontal lobe pre-exercise in subgroups of
Veterans with GWI. One subgroup characterized as ‘‘decreasers”
based on a worsening of working memory performance post-
exercise showed greater prefrontal lactate levels at baseline com-
pared to the subgroup showing improved working memory perfor-
mance post-exercise – labeled as ‘‘increasers”. Our study, although
different methodologically (e.g. submaximal exercise, testing 24 h
post exercise, ME/CFS vs GWI), compliments this research. Future
research among ME/CFS subgroups, either based on symptom pre-
sentation, illness onset or pathophysiology, will be important
towards determining for whom PEM is most debilitating and per-
haps help guide future treatment approaches. It is also important
to emphasize that this study is not an exercise training trial and
any extrapolation from a single bout of exercise to the chronic
exercise training literature should be done with caution. The
results do suggest caution for patients attempting to increase their
physical activity or start an exercise program. The appropriate use
of exercise training in this population requires taking into account
the patients limitations, avoiding harm and providing an individu-
alized and tailored exercise prescription. Taking into account the
variability in illness presentation, determining for whom exercise
training is efficacious and for whom exercise training is contraindi-
cated requires more research.
Results from this study should be considered with respect to
potential interactions between the central nervous system and
other systems implicated in the pathophysiology of ME/CFS. Prin-
ciple among these are the immune, neuroendocrine and autonomic
nervous systems. From a central nervous system injury perspec-
tive, neural inflammation or the activation of inflammasomes
and other inflammatory processes can lead to a vicious cycle or
as Gerwyn and Maes describe as a ‘‘self-sustaining feed forward
mechanism” of illness maintenance (de Rivero Vaccari et al.,
2014; Morris and Maes, 2014). The neuroendocrine system has
long been hypothesized as being involved in the genesis and main-
tenance of ME/CFS (Demitrack, 1998) and altered neuroendocrine
responses to exercise have been observed by some (Racciatti
et al., 2001), but not others (Ottenweller et al., 2001). Like the neu-
roendocrine system, the autonomic nervous system has been
explored extensively in ME/CFS and a recent meta-analysis
reported ‘‘good evidence” for higher heart rate and reduced blood
pressure responses during head-up tilt (Cauwenbergh et al.,
2014). It was also suggested that autonomic reactivity may be a
useful future diagnostic tool. To date, the interactions among these
linked systems has not been systematically evaluated for ME/CFS
in general nor specifically for PEM. Future research examining
how these biological systems respond to exercise, interact and pre-
dict symptoms of PEM will be necessary to further understand the
mechanisms of symptom generation and maintenance in ME/CFS
and will provide critical steps towards understanding the hetero-
geneity and pathophysiology of the disease.
4.5. Limitations
There are several limitations of the current study that should be
considered. The study only included women and thus whether the
results generalize to male ME/CFS patients’ remains to be deter-
mined. We also only tested healthy controls; therefore, the speci-
ficity of
the
neural responses
compared to other
fatiguing
illnesses cannot be determined. Future studies comparing ME/
CFS patients to appropriate patient controls are therefore needed.
Because of our pre-test, post-test design the specific impact of
exercise on cognition could not be fully determined (i.e. learning
effects). Future research using a more balanced design that
includes groups that are only tested pre- and post-exercise will
better determine how exercise influences cognitive function in
ME/CFS. We tested one relative exercise intensity and one exercise
mode for this initial study. Dose response studies will be necessary
to further determine neural responses to different exercise intensi-
ties and modes.
5. Conclusions
This study adds to the growing body of research implicating the
central nervous system, particularly abnormalities of brain struc-
ture and function, in the pathophysiology of ME/CFS (Nijs et al.,
2012). Although the genesis of the illness cannot be determined
due to the cross-sectional nature of the current body of research,
studies
demonstrating
altered
resting
state
function
(Boissoneault et al., 2016; Gay et al., 2016), reduced basal ganglia
responsivity (Miller et al., 2014), increased neural processing dur-
ing cognition (Lange et al., 2005), altered brain levels of lactate and
n-acetyl aspartate (Murrough et al., 2010), enhanced neuroinflam-
mation (Nakatomi et al., 2014) and altered metabolism (Naviaux
et al., 2016), combined with earlier research showing reduced
brain blood flow, increased white matter lesion burden (Lange
et al., 1999; Cook et al., 2001) and reduced gray and white matter

97
 volumes (Lange et al., 2001; Okada et al., 2004; Puri et al., 2014)
paint a complex picture of potential brain mechanisms of disease
maintenance. Our study extends upon these earlier works by incor-
porating acute exercise as a stressor and examining the neural con-
sequences of PEM – a defining characteristic of the disease. Overall,
this study’s findings emphasize the importance of symptom provo-
cation in the study of ME/CFS by demonstrating significant and
characteristically opposite brain and behavioral responses in
patients compared to controls – providing evidence that acute
exercise can negatively impact neurophysiological processes in
ME/CFS. These findings also provide objective evidence for the sub-
jective experience of cognitive symptoms (i.e. brain fog) reported
by ME/CFS patients when they attempt to be physically active.
Future studies incorporating additional physiological systems
(e.g.
autonomic,
immune,
genetic)
and
alternative
fatigue
manipulation designs will be necessary to further understand the
multifaceted pathophysiology of PEM.
