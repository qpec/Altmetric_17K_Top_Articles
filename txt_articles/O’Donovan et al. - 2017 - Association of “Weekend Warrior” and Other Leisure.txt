IMPORTANCE More research is required to clarify the association between physical activity
and health in “weekend warriors” who perform all their exercise in 1 or 2 sessions per week.
OBJECTIVE To investigate associations between the weekend warrior and other physical
activity patterns and the risks for all-cause, cardiovascular disease (CVD), and cancer
mortality.
DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS This pooled analysis of household-based surveillance
studies included 11 cohorts of respondents to the Health Survey for England and Scottish
Health Survey with prospective linkage to mortality records. Respondents 40 years or older
were included in the analysis. Data were collected from 1994 to 2012 and analyzed in 2016.
EXPOSURES Self-reported leisure time physical activity, with activity patterns defined as
inactive (reporting no moderate- or vigorous-intensity activities), insufficiently active
(reporting <150 min/wk in moderate-intensity and <75 min/wk in vigorous-intensity
activities), weekend warrior (reporting �150 min/wk in moderate-intensity or �75 min/wk in
vigorous-intensity activities from 1 or 2 sessions), and regularly active (reporting �150
min/wk in moderate-intensity or �75 min/wk in vigorous-intensity activities from �3
sessions). The insufficiently active participants were also characterized by physical activity
frequency.
MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES All-cause, CVD, and cancer mortality ascertained from
death certificates.
RESULTS Among the 63 591 adult respondents (45.9% male; 44.1% female; mean [SD] age,
58.6 [11.9] years), 8802 deaths from all causes, 2780 deaths from CVD, and 2526 from cancer
occurred during 561 159 person-years of follow-up. Compared with the inactive participants,
the hazard ratio (HR) for all-cause mortality was 0.66 (95% CI, 0.62-0.72) in insufficiently
active participants who reported 1 to 2 sessions per week, 0.70 (95% CI, 0.60-0.82) in
weekend warrior participants, and 0.65 (95% CI, 0.58-0.73) in regularly active participants.
Compared with the inactive participants, the HR for CVD mortality was 0.60 (95% CI,
0.52-0.69) in insufficiently active participants who reported 1 or 2 sessions per week, 0.60
(95% CI, 0.45-0.82) in weekend warrior participants, and 0.59 (95% CI, 0.48-0.73) in
regularly active participants. Compared with the inactive participants, the HR for cancer
mortality was 0.83 (95% CI, 0.73-0.94) in insufficiently active participants who reported 1 or
2 sessions per week, 0.82 (95% CI, 0.63-1.06) in weekend warrior participants, and 0.79
(95% CI, 0.66-0.94) in regularly active participants.
CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE Weekend warrior and other leisure time physical activity
patterns characterized by 1 or 2 sessions per week may be sufficient to reduce all-cause, CVD,
and cancer mortality risks regardless of adherence to prevailing physical activity guidelines.

L
eisure time physical activity is associated with reduced
risks for mortality from all causes, cardiovascular dis-
ease (CVD), and cancer.1 The World Health Organization
recommends that individuals aged 18 to 64 years should per-
form at least 150 min/wk of moderate-intensity aerobic activ-
ity, at least 75 min/wk of vigorous-intensity aerobic activity, or
equivalent combinations.2 More research is needed to deter-
mine how frequency, intensity, and duration of activity might
best be combined to achieve health benefits.3 The frequency of
activity is not specified, and one could meet prevailing guide-
lines by taking part in 30 minutes of moderate-intensity physi-
cal activity on 5 days of the week or 75 minutes of vigorous-
intensity physical activity on 1 day of the week. Those who
choose to do all their exercise on 1 or 2 days of the week have
been termed weekend warriors.4
Althoughlessfrequentboutsofactivitymightbemoreeas-
ily fit into a busy lifestyle, little is known about the benefits of
the weekend warrior physical activity pattern.4 Data from
the seminal Harvard Alumni Health Study suggest that all-
cause mortality risk might be lower in weekend warriors
than in sedentary men.4 Seventy-three deaths occurred in
the 580 weekend warriors in the Harvard Alumni Health
Study, and the authors acknowledged limited statistical
power to investigate mortality risk in the weekend warrior,
insufficient, and regular physical activity patterns.4 Because
cardiovascular disease and cancer are among the leading
causes of death,5 the primary objective of the present study
was to investigate associations between physical activity
patterns and all-cause, CVD, and cancer mortality in a
pooled analysis of 11 population-based cohorts. With much
greater statistical power than the classic weekend warrior
study,4 the secondary objective of the present study was to
investigate how frequency, intensity, and duration of physi-
cal activity might influence mortality.
Methods
Participants
The methods used in the Health Survey for England (HSE)
and Scottish Health Survey (SHS) are consistent and are
described elsewhere.6,7 Briefly, the HSE and SHS are
household-based surveillance studies in which households
are selected using a multistage, stratified probability design
to be representative of the target populations of the coun-
tries. Stratification was based on geographical areas, not indi-
vidual characteristics; postcode (zip code) sectors were
selected at the first stage, and household addresses were
selected at the second stage. Participants in the present study
were derived from surveys in 1994 (HSE only), 1995 (SHS
only), 1997 (HSE only), 1998 (HSE and SHS), 1999 (HSE only),
2003 (HSE and SHS), 2004 (HSE only), 2006 (HSE only), and
2008 (HSE only). Participants 40 years or older were in-
cluded in the present study for 2 reasons. First, the weekend
warrior physical activity pattern was deemed most appli-
cable to busy middle-aged individuals. Second, congenital ab-
normalities were deemed likely to be responsible for cardiac
events in young individuals and lifestyle to be responsible for
such events in adults.8 Local research ethics committees
approved all aspects of each survey, and all participants gave
written informed consent.
Physical Activity
Data were collected from 1994 to 2012. Trained interviewers
asked about physical activity. Physical activity was assessed
using an established questionnaire that is described
elsewhere.9 Briefly, the interviewer used the questionnaire to
inquire about the following aspects of the respondent’
s physi-
cal activity in the 4 weeks before the interview: frequency and
duration of participation in domestic physical activity (light
andheavyhousework,gardening,anddo-it-yourselftasks);fre-
quency, duration, and pace of walking (slow, average, brisk,
orfast);andparticipationinsportsandexercisesusingaprompt
card showing 10 main groupings, including cycling, swim-
ming, running, football, rugby, tennis, and squash. Six open
entries could also be recorded. For each sport and exercise, the
respondent was asked to specify frequency, duration, and per-
ceived intensity. The validity10 and reliability11 of the physi-
cal activity questionnaire are described elsewhere.
In 2175 adults, the Spearman correlation coefficient for ac-
celerometer assessment and questionnaire assessment of
moderate- and vigorous-intensity physical activity was 0.38
(95% CI, 0.32-0.45) in men and 0.40 (95% CI, 0.36-0.48) in
women.10Acompendium12wasusedtoidentifymoderate-and
vigorous-intensity physical activities in the present study as
follows: moderate activities consisted of 3.0 to 5.9 metabolic
equivalents (METs), and vigorous activities consisted of 6.0
METs or more, with 1 MET representing resting energy ex-
penditure. Occupational and routine domestic activities were
not included in the present analysis. Physical activity pat-
terns were defined as follows: inactive was defined as not re-
porting any moderate- or vigorous-intensity physical activi-
ties; insufficiently active, reporting less than 150 min/wk in
moderate-intensity physical activity and less than 75 min/wk
in vigorous-intensity physical activity; weekend warrior, re-
porting at least 150 min/wk in moderate-intensity physical
activity or at least 75 min/wk in vigorous-intensity physical
activity from 1 or 2 sessions; and regularly active, reporting
Key Points
Question What are the associations of physical activity patterns
with mortality?
Findings This pooled analysis of population-based surveys
included 63 591 adult respondents. All-cause mortality risk was
approximately 30% lower in active vs inactive adults, including
“weekend warrior” respondents who performed the
recommended amount of 150 minutes of moderate or 75 minutes
of vigorous activity from 1 or 2 sessions per week, insufficiently
active respondents who performed less than the recommended
amount from 1 or 2 sessions per week, and regularly active
respondents who performed the recommended amount from 3 or
more sessions per week.
Meaning Weekend warrior, insufficient, and regular physical
activity patterns may reduce mortality risk.

at least 150 min/wk in moderate-intensity physical activity
or at least 75 min/wk in vigorous-intensity physical activity
from 3 or more sessions.
Covariates
Trainedinterviewersaskedaboutage,sex,smokinghabit,long-
standing illness, occupation, and ethnicity. Participants were
asked whether they had any long-standing illness, disability,
or infirmity. Socioeconomic status was determined from
participants’occupations using the 4-group version of the
Registrar General’
s classification: professional and manage-
rial occupations; skilled nonmanual occupations; skilled
manualoccupations;androutineandmanualoccupations.The
trained interviewers also measured height and weight, and
body mass index (BMI) was expressed as the weight in kilo-
grams divided by the height in meters squared. Trained and
qualified nurses measured blood pressure and obtained a non-
fasting venous blood sample. Blood pressure was measured 3
times after 5 minutes of seated rest, and the mean of the sec-
ond and third readings was used. Quality control of blood
samples has been described elsewhere.13 The coefficient of
variation of the assays was less than 4%. Obesity was defined
as a BMI of at least 30 in the present study. High blood pres-
sure was defined as systolic pressure of at least 140 mm Hg,
diastolic pressure of at least 90 mm Hg, or a self-reported phy-
sician’
sdiagnosis.Ahighcholesterollevelwasdefinedasatotal
cholesterol concentration of greater than 193 mg/dL (to con-
vert to millimoles per liter, multiply by 0.0259).
Mortality Follow-up
The British National Health Service Central Registry flagged
participants. Data for survivors were censored to the end of
2009 (in the SHS) or the first quarter of 2011 (in the HSE). Di-
agnoses for the primary cause of death were based on codes
from the International Classification of Diseases, Ninth Revi-
sion (ICD-9) and International Statistical Classification of
Diseases and Related Health Problems, Tenth Revision (ICD-
10). Codes for CVD mortality were 390 to 459 for ICD-9 and I01
to I99 for ICD-10. Codes for cancer mortality were 140 to 239
for ICD-9 and C00 to D48 for ICD-10.
Statistical Analysis
Data were analyzed in 2016. We used Cox proportional haz-
ards regression models to estimate the associations between
physical activity pattern and the risks for all-cause, CVD, and
cancer mortality. We examined the proportional hazards as-
sumption by comparing the cumulative hazard plots grouped
on exposure, although no appreciable violations were noted.
Forthepresentanalyses,calendartime(months)wasthetimes-
cale. We excluded those who died during the first 24 months
of follow-up. Investigators14 have argued that models should
include variables that are thought to be important from the lit-
erature, whether or not they reach statistical significance in a
particular data set. Analyses were adjusted for age and sex
(model 1) and further adjusted for smoking habit, long-
standing illness, and occupation (model 2). In a series of sen-
sitivity analyses, we adjusted models for CVD at baseline and
BMI; we excluded all participants who had physician-
diagnosed CVD or cancer at baseline; we investigated par-
ticipants with obesity and the major risk factors,15 including
smoking, high cholesterol level, and high blood pressure (in-
teractions between the subgroups were investigated); and we
adjusted models for survey year. Associations among fre-
quency, intensity, and duration of physical activity and mor-
tality were investigated in secondary analyses. All analyses
were performed using SPSS software (version 22; IBM Corp).
Results
We included 63 591 survey respondents (45.9% male; 44.1%
female; mean [SD] age, 58.6 [11.9] years) in the present study.
Table 1 shows participants’characteristics at baseline by physi-
cal activity classification. Of these, 39 947 (62.8%) were clas-
sified as inactive at baseline; 14 224 (22.4%), as insufficiently
active; 2341 (3.7%), as weekend warriors; and 7079 (11.1%), as
regularly active. The inactive participants tended to be older,
to include a higher proportion of smokers, to be in unskilled
occupations,andtoincludeahigherproportionreportinglong-
standing illness. The mean BMI was similar in each group, and
more than 90% of participants were white. The weekend war-
riors included a higher proportion of men. One thousand fifty-
three weekend warriors (45.0%) reported taking part in 1 ses-
sion and 1288 (55.0%) reported taking part in 2 sessions of
physical activity per week. Two thousand two hundred one
weekend warriors (94.0%) and 5309 regularly active individu-
als (75.0%) reported participating in sports. Seven hundred
twenty-six weekend warriors (31.0%) and 5168 regularly ac-
tive individuals (73.0%) reported participating in walking at a
brisk or fast pace. The mean time spent in moderate- or vig-
orous-intensity physical activity was approximately 300
min/wk for weekend warriors and approximately 450 min/wk
in the regularly active participants; however, the proportion
of vigorous-intensity physical activity was higher in week-
end warriors than the regularly active participants. eTable 1 in
the Supplement shows participant age by survey and survey
year. eTable 2 in the Supplement shows physical activity vol-
umes by survey and survey year.
A total of 8802 deaths were due to all causes; 2780, due
to CVD; and 2526, due to cancer during 561 159 person-years
of follow-up (mean [SD], 8.8 [4.4] years) (eTable 3 in the
Supplement shows follow-up by survey and survey year).
Table 2 shows the multivariate associations between physi-
cal activity patterns and mortality. Compared with the in-
active participants, the fully adjusted hazard ratio (HR) for
all-cause mortality was 0.69 (95% CI, 0.65-0.74) in the insuf-
ficiently active participants, 0.70 (95% CI, 0.60-0.82) in the
weekend warrior participants, and 0.65 (95% CI, 0.58-0.73) in
the regularly active participants. Compared with the inactive
participants, the fully adjusted HR for CVD mortality was 0.63
(95% CI, 0.55-0.72) in the insufficiently active participants,
0.60 (95% CI, 0.45-0.82) in the weekend warrior partici-
pants, and 0.59 (95% CI, 0.48-0.73) in the regularly active par-
ticipants. Compared with the inactive participants, the fully
adjusted HR for cancer mortality was 0.86 (95% CI, 0.77-
0.96) in the insufficiently active participants, 0.82 (95% CI,

ported 1 or 2 physical activity sessions per week and 0.82 (95%
CI, 0.72-0.95) in the insufficiently active participants who re-
ported 3 or more physical activity sessions per week. The HRs
for CVD and cancer mortality of the insufficiently active par-
ticipants who reported 1 or 2 sessions per week were similar
to those for the entire insufficiently active group in Table 2,
but the HRs of the insufficiently active participants who re-

tions with CVD (HR, 0.79; 95% CI, 0.60-1.01) and cancer (HR,
0.99; 95% CI, 0.79-1.24) mortality were attenuated. Table 5
shows the associations between physical activity pattern and
mortality, with the insufficiently active participants as the ref-
erence category. Reductions in risk were similar in the insuf-
ficiently active and weekend warrior participants and were
lower in the regularly active participants.

tivity and all-cause mortality by survey and survey year. Al-
though variations across the HSE years were seen, no consis-
tent pattern was evident. eTable 5 in the Supplement shows

ity were similar in the obese participants and those with major
risk factors. We found no significant interactions among the
smoking, obesity, cholesterol level, and blood pressure sub-
groups. eTable 8 in the Supplement shows that the associa-
tions between physical activity pattern and mortality were
similar after further adjustment for survey year. eTable 9 in the

meeting the guidelines. In the subsample who reported 1 or 2

cause mortality was 0.78 (95% CI, 0.60-1.01) in those who re-
ported 3 or more sessions (the rest). eTable 10 in the

Discussion
The main objective of this study was to investigate associa-
tions between leisure time physical activity patterns and mor-
tality. We found that the insufficiently active, weekend war-
rior,andregularlyactivepatternswereassociatedwithreduced
risks for all-cause, CVD, and cancer mortality and that these
associationspersistedafteradjustmentforpotentialconfound-
ers or prevalent long-standing disease at baseline. Little was
known about the benefits of a low frequency of physical ac-
tivity. One of the most striking findings in the present study
was that 1 or 2 sessions per week of moderate- or vigorous-
intensity leisure time physical activity was sufficient to re-
duce all-cause, CVD, and cancer mortality risks regardless of
adherence to prevailing physical activity guidelines.
In their study of 8421 men, Lee and colleagues4 reported
that, compared with the inactive participants, the HR for all-
cause mortality was 0.75 (95% CI, 0.62-0.91) in the insuffi-
ciently active participants, 0.85 (95% CI, 0.65-1.11) in the week-
end warriors, and 0.64 (95% CI, 0.55-0.73) in the regularly
active participants. With greater statistical power, our study
shows that the risk for all-cause mortality is significantly lower
in weekend warriors than the inactive participants. We ex-
tend previous findings by showing that the association be-
tween the weekend warrior physical activity pattern and all-
cause mortality is much the same in men and women. We also
extend previous findings by investigating associations be-
tween physical activity patterns and CVD and cancer mortal-
ity. An important finding in the present study was that all-
cause mortality risk was lower in the insufficiently active
participants who reported 1 or 2 physical activity sessions per
week than in the inactive participants. Walking,16 running,17
and other18,19 freely chosen leisure time physical activities are
purposeful20andareofmoderateandvigorousintensities.The
present study suggests that some leisure time physical activ-
ity is better than none: that mortality risks were lower in the
insufficientlyactiveandtheweekendwarriorparticipantsthan
the inactive participants; that the reductions in risk in the in-
sufficientlyactiveandweekendwarriorparticipantsweresimi-
lar; and that, in those who reported meeting physical activity
guidelines, frequency and duration did not matter. Some evi-
dence suggests that mortality risks were lowest in the regu-
larly active participants, and the dose-response association in
the present study and others1 might be described as L-
shaped.
Physical inactivity costs global health care systems at least
US $54 billion per year.21 The recommended doses of physi-
cal activity can be met by manipulating frequency, duration,
and intensity. Although the recommended frequency is not
specified, inactive adults are suggested to first increase dura-
tion and frequency and then increase intensity to achieve the
recommendeddosesofactivitywhilereducingtheriskformus-
culoskeletal injury.2,22 Regular participation in physical activ-
ity has been recommended to control weight, cholesterol con-
centration, and blood pressure.22 The present study suggests
that less frequent bouts of activity, which might be more eas-
ily fit into a busy lifestyle, offer considerable health benefits,
even in the obese and those with major risk factors. A particu-
larly encouraging finding was that a physical activity fre-
quency as low as 1 or 2 sessions per week was associated with
lower mortality risks, even in the insufficiently active. Mil-
lions of people in England enjoy running, cycling, and
sports participation at least once per week.23,24 Our week-
end warrior participants undertook a large proportion of
vigorous-intensity physical activity, and quality may be
more important than quantity.25 For example, running is a
popular vigorous-intensity exercise, and low doses reduce
mortality risk.26 Vigorous-intensity exercise increases
cardiorespiratory fitness more than the same amount of
moderate-intensity exercise.27-29 Cardiorespiratory fitness
may be a stronger predictor of mortality than physical
activity,30-32 and, in a classic series of experiments, Hickson
and colleagues33-35 showed that cardiorespiratory fitness
could be maintained with 2 sessions of vigorous-intensity
exercise per week.
Limitations
Our study has some limitations. More than 90% of our par-
ticipants were white, and the results may not be generaliz-
able to other racial groups. Physical activity was only as-
sessed at baseline, and we cannot account for changes over
time. Physical activity was self-reported; however, question-
naires are still regarded as the mainstay of established surveil-
lance studies, such as the HSE and SHS.36 Occupational physi-
cal activity was not assessed; however, we considered
occupational social class as a covariate, and, unlike occupa-
tional physical activity, leisure time physical activity is dis-
cretionaryandhencepotentiallymodifiable.Thefollow-uppe-
riodwasshorterthanthatoftheclassicweekendwarriorstudy4
and was lower in some survey years than others; however, the
HRs were much the same after further adjustment for study
year. We cannot discount the possibility of reverse causation
in which participants with underlying disease are less likely
tobephysicallyactive;however,weexcludeddeathsinthefirst
24 months of follow-up; adjusted for long-standing illness,
CVD, and cancer at baseline; and performed sensitivity analy-
ses to address the issue of reverse causation. The risk for mus-
culoskeletal injury was not assessed. Injury may reduce
participation37;however,wemayreasonablyassumethatmost
injury-related reductions in participation were short lived be-
cause data from former varsity athletes suggest that physical
activity must be maintained in later years to reduce chronic
disease risk.38

Conclusions
This large, statistically powerful study suggests that dif-
ferent leisure time physical activity patterns are associated
with reduced risks for all-cause, CVD, and cancer mortality.
The weekend warrior and other physical activity patterns
characterized by 1 or 2 sessions per week of moderate-
or vigorous-intensity physical activity may be sufficient
to reduce risks for all-cause, CVD, and cancer mortality
regardless of adherence to prevailing physical activity
guidelines.

Invited Commentary
Physical Activity on the Weekend
Can It Wait Until Then?
Hannah Arem, PhD; Loretta DiPietro, PhD
The World Health Organization (WHO)1 and the US Depart-
ment of Health and Human Services (HHS)2 recommend a
minimum of 150 min/wk of moderate-intensity aerobic activ-
ity (or 75 min/wk of vigorous-intensity activity). These rec-
ommendations suggest that
“substantial” health benefits
accrue by meeting the recom-
mended minimum level of
physical activity and that “additional” benefit can be gained
by performing more than the minimum level.1,2 The HHS and
WHO guidelines advise that the recommended level of physi-
cal activity be spread throughout the week. Because the op-
timalcombinationofphysicalactivityfrequency,intensity,and
duration to reduce mortality risk remains poorly understood,
interest is emerging in the relative benefits of compressing rec-
ommended levels of activity into 1 to 2 days per week to ac-
commodate time constraints.
InthisissueoftheJAMAInternalMedicine,O’
Donovanand
colleagues3 report new evidence that “weekend warriors”
(those who meet the recommended minimum level of activ-
ity in 1-2 d/wk) have a significantly lower risk for all-cause mor-
tality, as well as mortality from cardiovascular disease (CVD)
orcancer,comparedwithpeoplereportingnomoderate-tovig-
orous-intensity activity. Interestingly, the reduction in mor-
tality risk among the weekend warriors (30%; hazard ratio
[HR], 0.70; 95% CI, 0.60-0.82) was similar to that of partici-
pantscharacterizedasinsufficientlyactive(31%;HR,0.69;95%
CI, 0.65-0.74), defined as performing less than the recom-
mended 150 min/wk; those who were regularly active (de-
fined as meeting the recommendations in ≥3 d/wk) had a
slightly lower mortality risk (35%; HR, 0.65; 95% CI, 0.58-
0.73).Theauthorsconcludethatacompressedpatternofphysi-
cal activity may be sufficient to reduce all-cause, CVD, and
cancer mortality.
Theencouragingnewsemergingfromthisnewreportisthat
for those who exercise less frequently, meeting the guidelines
minimum in only 1 to 2 sessions per week yields some mortal-
ity benefit. This study by O’
Donovan et al3 compliments a pre-
vious publication showing an L-shaped association between
physical activity and mortality, with a sharp drop in mortality
risk (approximately 20%) comparing those who reported some
moderate- to vigorous-intensity physical activity (walking 1-75
min/wkatabriskpace)withthosewhoreportednoleisuretime
activity.4Togetherthesefindingssuggestthatsomephysicalac-
tivityinanisolatedsessionorlowactivityiscertainlybetterthan
no activity for reducing mortality risk, and that those who ex-
ercise 1 to 2 times per week may lower their risk even further
with more frequent activity.
Still, the role of physical activity patterns in reducing mor-
talityriskmayneedtobeconsideredwithinthecontextofone’
s
sedentary patterns. The most recent Lancet series on physi-
cal activity featured a harmonized analysis of the joint effects
ofphysicalactivityandsedentarytimeonmortalityriskinmore
than 1 million people.5 This powerful analysis suggested that
among those reporting less than approximately 5.25 to 7 h/wk
of moderate-intensity activity, more sitting time was associ-
ated with a significantly increased all-cause mortality risk; this
risk was accelerated at very low levels of activity. In contrast,
amongthosereportingmorethan approximately5.25to7h/wk
