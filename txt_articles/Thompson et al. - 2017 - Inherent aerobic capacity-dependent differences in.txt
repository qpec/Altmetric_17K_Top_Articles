Abstract
Although regular physical activity is associated with improvement in aerobic capacity and lower breast cancer risk, there 
are heritable sets of traits that affect improvement in aerobic capacity in response to physical activity. Although aerobic 
capacity segregates risk for a number of chronic diseases, the effect of the heritable component on cancer risk has not 
been evaluated. Therefore, we investigated breast carcinogenesis in rodent models of heritable fitness in the absence of 
induced physical activity. Female offspring of N:NIH rats selectively bred for low (LIAC) or high (HIAC) inherent aerobic 
capacity were injected intraperitoneally with 1-methyl-1-nitrosurea (70 mg/kg body wt). At study termination 33 weeks 
post-carcinogen, cancer incidence (14.0 versus 47.3%; P < 0.001) and multiplicity (0.18 versus 0.85 cancers per rat; P < 0.0001) 
were significantly decreased in HIAC versus LIAC rats, respectively. HIAC had smaller visceral and subcutaneous body fat 
depots than LIAC and activity of two proteins that regulated the mammalian target of rapamycin, protein kinase B (Akt), 
and adenosine monophosphate-activated protein kinase were suppressed and activated, respectively, in HIAC. Although 
many factors distinguish between HIAC and LIAC, it appears that the protective effect of HIAC against breast carcinogenesis 
is mediated, at least in part, via alterations in core metabolic signaling pathways deregulated in the majority of human 
breast cancers.
Introduction
Lifestyle behaviors play an important role in the etiology of 
breast cancer (1). A wealth of observational data indicates 
that self-reported regular physical activity is associated with, 
on average, a 25% risk reduction in premenopausal as well as 
postmenopausal breast cancer incidence compared with inac-
tive women even after controlling for important confounding 
variables (2,3). There is also evidence of a ‘dose–response’ rela-
tionship. Specifically, 2–3 h/week of moderately intense physi-
cal activity is associated with a 9% reduction in risk, whereas 
>6 h/week (of moderately intense physical activity) is associ-
ated with a 30% reduction in risk (3,4). On the basis of avail-
able data, national agencies recommend that all adult women 
participate in at least 150 min of moderately intense or 75 min 
of vigorously intense physical activity per week or a combina-
tion of these (5).
Self-reported assessment of physical activity has recognized 
limitations (6). In response, other assessment tools of physical 
activity exposure, such as exercise tolerance testing, have been 
developed and aerobic capacity, also referred to as cardiorespi-
ratory fitness, has been identified as an objective measure of 
physical activity exposure. Aerobic capacity is an established 
independent predictor of cardiovascular and all-cause mortality 
in adults with and without cardiovascular disease (7). In contrast 
to the setting of cardiovascular disease, the clinical importance

of aerobic capacity for the prediction of breast cancer risk 
has received scant attention. In a prospective cohort study of 
14,811 women participating in the Cooper Center Longitudinal 
Study, aerobic capacity was associated with a reduced risk of 
dying from breast cancer in women (8). Moreover, in a review 
of 27 clinical trials and observational studies measuring aero-
bic capacity in the pre- and post-adjuvant treatment setting 
for breast cancer, aerobic capacity was substantially lower in 
women with a history of breast cancer compared with healthy 
women and this was most pronounced among breast cancer 
patients in the post-adjuvant setting (9). Although neither study 
assessed the relationship between aerobic capacity and incident 
breast cancer, it has been assessed in other cancer sites where 
higher aerobic capacity, assessed at mid-life, was associated 
with a 68 and 38% reduction in the risk of lung and colorectal 
cancer, respectively, compared with the lowest aerobic capacity 
quintile in 17,049 men (10).
For the work reported herein, the tenet that aerobic capacity 
is directly related to physical activity exposure was juxtaposed 
with a body of evidence showing that among populations of 
individuals undergoing the same exercise training protocol that 
marked differences exist in response relative to the improve-
ment of aerobic capacity (11,12). These differential responses 
have been shown to have a genetic component with heritabil-
ity accounting for 40–49% of the differences in improvement in 
aerobic capacity to the same exercise training protocol. Whether 
higher intrinsic aerobic capacity confers protection against the 
development of breast cancer has not been evaluated. Here, 
we investigated this question by examining the direct effect of 
inherited, as opposed to physical activity-induced, differences 
in aerobic capacity, using an established breeding program of 
rodents intentionally selected on the basis of their inherent abil-
ity to run on a treadmill (13–15). We tested the effects of low 
(LIAC) versus high (HIAC) inherent aerobic capacity (IAC): (i) on 
breast cancer incidence, multiplicity and latency and (ii) on the 
level of circulating growth factors and hormones and activity 
of proteins in mammary gland that interface with core signal-
ing pathways frequently deregulated during the development of 
breast cancer.
Materials and methods
Study design
Breeding pairs
Sixteen breeding pairs of HIACs and LIACs from generation 29 of selection 
(N = 8 per cohort) were obtained from the Department of Anesthesiology 
at the University of Michigan directed by SLB and LGK (16). All animals 
were subjected to a maximal treadmill exercise test to determine aerobic 
capacity, as published previously (17). The mean distance and duration for 
HIACs and LIACs were 2106 ± 273 m (74.6 min) and 260 ± 60 m (18.3 min), 
respectively.
Experimental procedures
Female pups weaned from dams at 21 days of age were assigned into two 
groups: one with offspring from LIAC breeding pairs and the other with 
offspring from HIAC breeding pairs. Rats remained sedentary for the entire 
study, i.e. they had normal cage activity within the group housing setting 
(three rats per cage). Animals were maintained in solid bottomed polycarbon-
ate cages and fed a standard laboratory diet (Harlan 2918 Teklad Lab Animal 
Diet) ad libitum. Rooms were maintained at 22 ± 1°C with 50% relative humid-
ity and a 12-h light/12-h dark cycle. The experimental protocol was reviewed 
and approved by the Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee and con-
ducted according to the committee guidelines at Colorado State University.
Carcinogen administration and tumor detection
At 21 days of age, LIACs (N = 55) and HIACs (N = 57) were injected intraperi-
toneally with 1-methyl-1-nitrosurea (70 mg/kg, Ash Stevens, Detroit, MI), 
as described previously (18). Animals were weighed weekly and palpated 
for mammary tumors twice weekly starting from 3 weeks post-carcino-
gen. The study was terminated 33 weeks post-carcinogen injection, fol-
lowing a period of 6 weeks during which no new mammary tumors were 
detected by palpation.
Necropsy
Following an overnight fast, all animals were euthanized between 8 a.m. 
and 11 a.m. via inhalation of gaseous carbon dioxide. Blood samples were 
drawn via retro-orbital sinus into ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid-coated 
tubes (Becton Dickinson, Franklin Lakes, NJ) for plasma. Rats were then 
skinned and the skin to which mammary gland chains were attached 
was examined under translucent light for detectable mammary patholo-
gies at ×5 magnification. All detectable mammary gland pathologies were 
excised and a cross section prepared for histological classification accord-
ing to published criteria (19). After excision of detectable pathologies, the 
abdominal–inguinal mammary gland chains were excised, one side snap 
frozen in liquid nitrogen and the other side processed as a whole mount 
preparation per our published method (19).
Plasma biomarkers
Plasma was isolated by centrifugation of blood obtained at necropsy at 
1000g for 10 min at room temperature and then stored at −80°C until it 
was analyzed. Plasma was subjected to the assessment of the following 
molecules: insulin-like growth factor-1 (IGF-1), corticosterone, insulin 
and leptin using commercially available enzyme-linked immunosorbent 
assays (Diagnostic Systems Laboratory, Webster, TX; Cayman Chemicals, 
Ann Arbor, MI; and Millipore, Billerica, MA). Glucose was determined 
enzymatically using a commercially available kit (Pointe Scientific, 
Canton, MI.).
Digital analysis of mammary gland and fat pad
Mammary epithelial area and the area of the subcutaneous fat pad in 
which the mammary gland is embedded were determined using our 
previously published method for rat mammary gland (20). Briefly, digi-
tal images of the mammary gland whole mounts (prepared as described 
above) were captured using a semi-automated image acquisition system. 
A series of Z-stack images were automatically captured using a motorized 
stage creating a seamlessly merged single uniformly focused composite 
image of each mammary gland. Resulting images were analyzed using 
Image-Pro® plus 4.5 (Mediacybernetics, Silver Spring, MD) image analysis 
software to quantify mammary gland epithelial area.
Western blot-based immune nanocapillary electrophoresis
Frozen tissues were removed from −80°C storage and quickly ground 
to a fine powder in liquid nitrogen using ceramic mortars and pestles. 
Lysis buffer was prepared using ice-cold T-PER tissue protein extraction 
reagent (Thermo Fisher Scientific, Waltham, MA) with Halt protease and 
phosphatase inhibitor cocktail at 1:50 (Thermo Fisher Scientific), and 0.5M 
ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid at 1:100 to inhibit metalloproteases. Ice-
cold 7.5 ml glass Dounce homogenizers (VWR, Radnor, PA) were filled with 
1.5 ml of lysis buffer and tared on the scale. Frozen tissue powder was 
quickly weighed in the Dounce and then homogenized on ice using 10 
full strokes of the glass pestle followed by vortexing for 5 s and sonica-
tion (Branson Sonifier S-250A, Fisher Scientific), using 1 pulse (10% duty 
cycle and control set at 5). The homogenization process was repeated four 
times and samples were allowed to sit on ice for an additional 10 min 
prior to transfer to 2.0 ml microfuge tubes and centrifugation at 12,000g 
for 20 min. A glass Pasteur pipet was used to extract the supernatant 
sandwiched between the cell pellet and surface lipid layer. The lysate

supernatant was divided into 25 µl single use aliquots using 0.2 ml PCR 
tubes and stored at −80°C. Protein concentration was determined using 
the Bradford assay. Nano capillary electrophoresis was performed using 
the WES instrument and proprietary kits (ProteinSimple, San Jose, CA). 
The kits consisted of microplates with a prefilled section containing pro-
prietary reagents, cartridge with 25 nano capillaries, lyophilized stand-
ard pack (DTT, biotinylated ladder and fluorescent standards), 10× sample 
buffer, secondary antibody, horseradish peroxidase-conjugated streptavi-
din (ladder only), luminol-S, peroxide, antibody diluent and wash buffer. 
Briefly, samples were prepared by adding 2.5 µl of diluted tissue lysate 
to a 0.2 ml PCR tube containing 1.5 µl of 5× fluorescent master mix and 
3.5 µl of 0.1× sample buffer. Samples were denatured in a dry bath at 95°C 
for 5 min. Samples, biotinylated ladder, multiplexed primary antibodies, 
horseradish peroxidase-conjugated secondary antibody, chemilumines-
cent substrate (luminol-S peroxide) and wash buffer were pipetted into 
the appropriate wells according to kit instructions.
The capillary cartridge and microplate were loaded into the fully 
automated WES instrument. The entire assay was completed within each 
capillary as follows: the vacuum manifold loaded each capillary with a 
separation matrix, stacking matrix and sample; a voltage of 375 V was 
applied for 30 min to separate the proteins based on size followed by 
exposure to UV light in order to immobilize the proteins in the capil-
lary prior to immuno-labeling and subsequent detection resulting in the 
chemiluminescent signal intensity of each target protein displayed as an 
electropherogram.
The electropherogram for each antibody used in this study, deter-
mined on a pooled sample of 10 mammary glands as part of our quality 
control protocol for antibody selection, is shown along with the vendor 
and catalog number for each antibody (Supplementary Figure 1 is avail-
able at Carcinogenesis Online).
Statistical analyses
The carcinogenesis experiment had 80% power to detect an effect size 
of 0.5 in incident cancer between the LIAC and HIAC groups based on an 
incidence of 50% in the N:NIH founder population determined in a prelim-
inary experiment (data not shown). Incidence of mammary carcinomas in 
LIAC versus HIAC was compared using the Fischer exact test, whereas the 
between-group analysis of the number of mammary carcinomas per rat 
(multiplicity) was by Poisson regression (21). Cancer latency was evaluated

by survival analysis using the Mantel–Haenszel method. Plasma biomark-
ers and protein expression data were evaluated by analysis of variance 
and multivariate techniques per our previously published approach (22).
Results
Carcinogenic response 
The occurrence of the first palpable carcinoma in a rat over 
time, i.e. cancer latency, was prolonged in HIAC versus LIAC 
[Figure 1A; Mantel hazard ratio = 4.01; 2.02–7.93, 95% confi-
dence interval (95% CI); P = 4 × 10-4]. In order to assess whether 
tumor occurrence was simply delayed in HIAC versus LIAC, 
the experiment was allowed to continue for a long duration 
(33 weeks post-carcinogen injection). Inspection of the time 
course of tumor emergence (Figure 1A and B) showed that no 
additional palpable tumors were detected after 17 weeks post-
carcinogen in HIAC, whereas tumors continued to emerge in 
LIAC until 27 weeks post-carcinogen. At the end of the study, 
the incidence of mammary cancer detectable by palpation 
was 7.0% in HIAC compared with 34.5% in LIAC (P = 3.5 × 10-4). 
Cancer multiplicity was 0.1 per animal (0.0–0.2, 95% CI) in HIAC 
compared with 0.5 per animal (0.3–0.8, 95% CI) in LIAC (P = 3.0 × 
10-4) (Table 1). Moreover, of the eight tumor-bearing HIAC rats, 
only one animal had more than one carcinoma (three tumors), 
whereas 12 of the 26 LIAC rats had multiple tumors, ranging 
between two to five carcinomas per rat. Thus, even in animals 
that developed cancer, HIAC was associated with resistance to 
disease occurrence.
Given that no new palpable tumors occurred in either group 
after 27 weeks until the end of the study, these findings support 
the possibility that HIAC provided absolute protection against 
cancer. To further examine this issue, data were also obtained 
on the occurrence of occult disease, i.e. microcarcinoma weigh-
ing <100 mg, which were detected via inspection of the mam-
mary glands using 5× magnification at necropsy. The incidence 
and number of microcarcinomas was significantly lower in HIAC 
versus LIAC (8.8 versus 25.5%, P = 2.4 × 10-2 and 0.1 versus 0.3 can-
cers per rat, P = 1.5 × 10-2, respectively, HIAC versus LIAC). When 
the data on occurrence of microcarcinoma were combined with 
the incidence and multiplicity of carcinomas that were palpa-
ble, protection against the occurrence of cancer in HIAC rats was 
robust (14.0 versus 47.3%, P = 1.8 × 10-5 and 0.18 versus 0.85 can-
cers per rat, P = 7.0 × 10-5, respectively, HIAC versus LIAC).
Physiological parameters and the carcinogenic response
To determine if the amount of mammary epithelium at risk for 
the development of cancer was similar in both groups, mammary 
epithelial area was determined via digital analysis of mammary 
gland whole mounts in LIAC and HIAC rats at 21 days of age, 
i.e. the age at which carcinogen was administered (Figure 1C). 
No statistically significant difference existed between LIAC and 
HIAC (0.829 ± 0.049 cm2 versus 0.791 cm2 ± 0.039, mean ± SEM, 
respectively, P = 0.6).
We examined potential contributions of body weight and dif-
ferences in adiposity to the observed differences in the carci-
nogenic response. Consistent with other reports (23), final body 
weights of LIAC rats were 15% higher than HIAC rats (217 ± 4.9 
versus 183 ± 4.1, mean ± SEM, P = 1 × 10-2); however, inspection 
of the time points at which tumors were detected by palpation 
(subsequently confirmed to be mammary carcinomas histologi-
cally) with body weight (Figure 2A) was consistent with statisti-
cal evidence that body weight was not a significant covariate 
in modeling effects of IAC on cancer incidence or multiplic-
ity. Recognizing that there was considerable overlap in body 
weights of LIAC and HIAC throughout the study (Figure 2B), we 
also explored the potential influence of different growth rates 
by limiting the analysis of the carcinogenic response to animals 
with a final body weight between 185 and 225 g. This resulted 
in two groups of rats (N = 30 per group) that differed in final 
body weight by 5%. As shown in Table 2, no palpable tumors 
were detected in HIAC and the difference in the carcinogenic 
response between HIAC and LIAC was numerically greater 
than reported in Table 1 (cancer incidence: 3.3 versus 50.0%, 
HIAC versus LIAC, P < 6.0 × 10-4). We also measured the size of 
the subcutaneous fat pad in which the mammary epithelium 
is embedded and observed that the difference between LIAC 
and HIAC diverged over time primarily during the time interval 
beyond the emergence of the majority of tumors in either group 
(Figure 2C). At the end of the study, visceral and subcutaneous 
fat pads were larger in LIAC versus HIAC (69%, P = 0.001 and 
16%, P = 0.02, respectively; Supplementary Table 1, available at 
Carcinogenesis Online).

The heritability of the difference in aerobic capacity in 
this model system and running behavior between genera-
tions is high and has been reported (24). Nonetheless, since the 
carcinogenesis study was performed using the offspring of rats 
phenotyped for maximal running capacity on a treadmill, we 
took nine HIAC and nine LIAC female rats at the mid-point of 
the carcinogenesis experiment that had not been injected with 
carcinogen and provided them access to our computer con-
trolled non-motorized running wheels (25). This was a situa-
tion to which the rats had not previously been exposed. For four 
consecutive days, each rat was given access to its own running 
wheel during the dark phase of the light/dark cycle, which is 
the component of the photoperiod during which rats are most 
active. The average distance run was four times greater in HIAC 
than LIAC (4.1 ± 0.1 km, HIAC versus 0.9 ± 0.04 km, LIAC; mean 
± SEM; P < 1 × 10-3). This demonstrates how differences in IAC 
translate into voluntary wheel running behavior.
Cell signaling pathways and circulating growth 
factors and hormones
Mammalian target of rapamycin signaling network. Mammalian tar-
get of rapamycin (mTOR) is a master sensor of changes in nutri-
ent and energy status. Initially, two key regulatory nodes for 
mTOR were investigated, protein kinase B (Akt), the activation of 
which induces mTOR activity and adenosine monophosphate-
activated protein kinase (AMPK), which is a negative regulator of 
mTOR (Table 3 and Figure 3). Protection against cancer in HIAC 
rats was associated with a significant reduction in the level 
of phospho-Akt (Ser473) and an increased level of phospho-
AMPK (Thr172). To evaluate whether the shifts in phosphoryla-
tion of Akt and AMPK had functional significance, we probed 
downstream targets involved in the regulation of mTOR kinase 
activity.
Proline-rich Akt substrate 40 (PRAS40) is a target of activated 
Akt as well as of activated mTOR (26). We focused on phospho-
PRAS40 (Thr246), which is the site phosphorylated by Akt and 
observed it to be downregulated in HIAC breast tissue. Moreover, 
there was a strong linear relationship between levels of pAkt 
(Ser473) and pPRAS40 (Thr246) (r2 = 0.77; P < 1.0 × 10-3), thus, sup-
porting the view that the downregulation of Akt activation in 
mammary gland associated with HIAC had regulatory signifi-
cance. We also probed regulatory-associated protein of mTOR, 
a negative regulator of mTOR activity (27), as well as acetyl COA 
carboxylase, which is a rate limiting step in lipid synthesis. 
Activated AMPK negatively regulates both proteins; however, 
the observed numerical increases in phosphorylation of these 
targets predicted by AMPK activation in HIAC did not reach the 
level of statistical significance.
Given differences in PRAS40 phosphorylation distinguishing 
between HIAC and LIAC, we next investigated 4-EBP1 and p70S6 
kinase, downstream targets of mTOR frequently upregulated 
in breast cancer. The 4-EBP1 encodes one member of a family 
of translation repressor proteins. The protein directly interacts 
with eukaryotic translation initiation factor 4E, which is a limit-
ing component of the multi-subunit complex that recruits 40S 
ribosomal subunits to the 5′ end of mRNAs. Interaction of this 
protein with eIF4E inhibits complex assembly and represses 
translation. When this protein is phosphorylated, it dissociates 
from eIF4E and results in activation of cap-dependent mRNA 
translation (28). Both total protein and phospho-4EBP1 (Thr37/46) 
(but not there ratio) were lower in HIAC, consistent with sup-
pression of mTOR activity. Ribosomal protein S6 kinase, also 
known as p70S6 kinase, is a serine/threonine kinase whose tar-
get substrate is the S6 ribosomal protein. Phosphorylation of S6 
induces protein synthesis at the ribosome. The phosphorylation 
of p70S6K at threonine 389 has been used as a hallmark of acti-
vation by mTOR (29). Unlike the finding with 4EPB1, differences

in phospho-p70S6K (Thr389) were not observed, although the 
total amount of p70S6K was reduced in HIAC versus LIAC. The 
contrasting pattern of expression of 4EBP1 and p70S6K indicate 
complexity in the regulation of mTOR network signaling that 
extends beyond the canonical pathways usually considered.
Since the mTOR-signaling cascade regulates cell prolifera-
tion and apoptosis, we next investigated effects on G1/S tran-
sition of the cell cycle (cyclin D1 and p27) as well as proteins 
involved in the induction of apoptosis via the intrinsic mecha-
nism. The only difference that was detected was an increase in 
BAX protein in HIAC; BAX is considered a pro-apoptotic factor. 
This was observed in the absence of significant effects on antia-
poptotic protein BCL2 or the inhibitor of apoptosis protein, XIAP. 
These data, though limited in scope, are consistent with a proa-
poptotic environment existing in breast tissue of animals with 
HIAC and point to the value of understanding how IAC regulates 
cell death pathways in future work.
PI3K–Akt regulation. Although the activation of AMPK in HIAC 
is consistent with the small but significant increase in con-
centration of circulating adiponectin in HIAC (Supplementary 
Table 2, available at Carcinogenesis Online), the lack of difference 
in insulin or IGF-1 in plasma of HIAC versus LIAC rats indicated 
that cell autonomous processes were operative. Therefore, the 
regulation of the PI3K–Akt pathway was examined in greater 
detail. We reasoned that Akt activation could still be influenced 
by circulating levels of insulin and IGF-1 if cell surface recep-
tors were increased. As an initial test of this idea, we measured 
the concentration of IGF receptor-1, a tyrosine kinase receptor 
that has been implicated in breast cancer. We also measured the 
level of insulin receptor substrate-1, which is a signaling adapter 
protein transmitting signals from the insulin and IGF-1 recep-
tors to the PI3K–Akt pathway. However, neither the amount of 
IGF receptor-1 nor insulin receptor substrate-1 differed in the 
mammary gland of LIAC and HIAC (Supplementary Figure 2 and 
Table 3, available at Carcinogenesis Online). We also probed phos-
pho-insulin receptor substrate (Ser636/639), which was found to 
be higher in LIAC (P = 0.005). This is consistent with activation 
of PI3K signaling (30). We also probed the levels of phosphatase 
and tensin homolog (PTEN), a protein that acts as a tumor sup-
pressor and that is mutated with a high frequency in breast can-
cer. PTEN is a dual specificity protein tyrosine phosphatase that 
preferentially dephosphorylates phosphoinositide substrates. 
It negatively regulates intracellular levels of phosphatidylinosi-
tol-3,4,5-trisphosphate, thereby suppressing signaling mediated 
by Akt (31). PTEN and phosho-PTEN (Ser380) were significantly 
higher in LIAC versus HIAC. The phosphorylation of this site has 
been reported to reduce PTEN activity, which would be consist-
ent with higher levels of phosho-Akt observed in LIAC mam-
mary gland, although the ratio of phospho to total PTEN did not 
differ. Taken collectively, the data on mTOR network activity are 
consistent with cell autonomous regulation of PI3K–Akt sign-
aling in accounting for the difference in cancer susceptibility 
between LIAC and HIAC.

measured in a subgroup of rats (Supplementary Table 2, avail-
able at Carcinogenesis Online). Plasma leptin was 5-fold higher 
in LIAC, and thus, we reasoned that higher circulating leptin 
would be associated with activation of the JAK2/STAT3 pathway 
in the mammary gland, an observation that would be consistent 
with increased cancer susceptibility in LIAC, but no significant 
differences were found (Supplementary Figure 2 and Table 3, 
available at Carcinogenesis Online). Because the HIAC phenotype 
has been recently compared with the effects of caloric restric-
tion (32), we also measured plasma corticosterone, which is 
elevated by caloric restriction. Plasma corticosterone was 3-fold 
higher in HIAC than LIAC (Table 3), and thus, we reasoned that 
stress-related signaling, presumably mediated via the binding 
of corticosterone to the glucocorticoid receptor, would be higher 
with higher plasma corticosterone and confer tumor suppressor 
activity within the mammary gland via activation of p38MAPK 
(33). However, using phospho-p38MAPK (Thr180/T
yr182) as an 
indicator of pathway activation, no differences were observed 
between concentrations of either p38MAPK total protein or 
phosho-p38MAPK, and further analysis of this pathway was not 
undertaken.
Discussion
This is, to our knowledge, the first report of a relationship 
between IAC and breast cancer risk. The LIAC/HIAC models have 
been widely studied with over 100 publications reporting their 
use, although not in the field of cancer research (34). Included 
in those reports are extensive characterizations of the pheno-
types that distinguish between HIAC and LIAC (35–37). Female 
HIAC rats that are fed ad libitum generally have a body weight 
that is 15% lighter than LIAC and they have less body fat and 
display higher in-cage activity. These phenotypes are consist-
ent with the cancer protective effects associated with reduced 
adiposity, caloric restriction, and induced physical activity but 
were sustained in the absence of restricted feeding or exercise 
in these models. Although our subgroup analysis (Table 2) is 
notable in that the protective effect of HIAC against breast can-
cer (relative to LIAC) was not diminished in rats with similar 
group mean body weights (differed by only 5%) in comparison 
with the carcinogenic response observed when all animals were 
considered (Table 1), the potential contributions of differences 
in caloric intake, adiposity or in cage activity to the observed 
effects are not known. However, the magnitude of the protective 
effect of HIAC against breast cancer (RR = 0.38; 95% CI, 0.2 to 0.8) 
was considerably greater than observed in response to caloric 
restriction resulting in the same 15% difference in body weight 
(RR = 0.94; 95% CI 0.6–1.4; ref. 38), running on a non-motorized 
activity wheel (7650 m/day) (RR = 0.92; 95% CI 0.7–1.2; ref. 25) or 
resistance to excessive body fat accumulation with a 15% differ-
ence in body weights (RR = 0.83; 95% CI, 0.7–1.1; ref. 39) in other 
rat models of chemically induced mammary cancer.
Factors such as energy intake and physical activity that influ-
ence energy balance are linked to a signaling network known

to be deregulated in the majority of human breast cancer, the 
mTOR network (40–42). The mTOR network signaling was down-
regulated in HIAC, identifying it as a potential metabolic hub 
that is integrating multiple signaling inputs associated with 
differences in IAC. Circulating factors have been frequently 
cited to explain differences in cancer risk attributed to physical 
activity as well as caloric restriction and diet-induced obesity 
(38,39,43,44). The fact that plasma concentrations of the growth 
factors and hormones (Supplementary Table 2, available at 
Carcinogenesis Online) were not associated with signaling path-
ways implicated in carcinogenesis indicates that simply exam-
ining a snapshot of changes in these circulating factors that can 
vary over time is not sufficient to explain the potential effects of 
IAC on cancer outcomes. This is consistent with the possibility 
that changes in circulating concentrations of these factors do 
not reflect availability at the tissue or cellular level. The molec-
ular data presented suggest that cell autonomous rather than 
host systemic effects are involved in mediating the observed 
differences in the carcinogenic response observed in HIAC ver-
sus LIAC. Specifically, it appears that the PI3k/Akt/mTOR signal-
ing network, which is commonly deregulated in breast cancer 
(40–42,45), accounts at least in part for protection against cancer 
potentially through the maintenance of a pro-apoptotic micro-
environment in mammary tissue of rats with HIAC.
Due to technical feasibility and cost in epidemiological stud-
ies, little attention has been given to how aerobic capacity, an 
objective indicator of physical activity exposure, is associated 
with cancer risk. This is a significant limitation given the rec-
ognized problems associated with the self-reported data used 
to conclude that physical activity protects against the develop-
ment of breast cancer (2,3,6). Although care must be exercised 
not to over extend the implications of our data (Tables 1 and 
2 and Figure 1) relative to evidence about protective effects of 
physical activity on cancer risk in human populations, it is nota-
ble that when given access to an activity wheel, HIAC rats vol-
untarily run much longer distances each day than LIAC (35), a 
finding that we have confirmed. The role of IAC and its effect 
on running behavior and cancer risk have not been investigated 
in epidemiological studies. Nonetheless, if the same type of 
relationship observed in rodents occurs in humans with HIAC, 
then at least a component of the protection against breast 
cancer that is associated with a physically active lifestyle may 
actually be a genetically determined cancer susceptibility trait 
that acts independent of physical activity behaviors. It remains 
to be determined how imposition of physical activity-induced 
improvements in fitness in the HIAC/LIAC model systems of IAC 
will affect the carcinogenic response.
