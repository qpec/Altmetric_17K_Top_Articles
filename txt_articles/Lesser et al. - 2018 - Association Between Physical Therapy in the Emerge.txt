Association Between Physical Therapy in the Emergency
Department and Emergency Department Revisits for Older
Adult Fallers: A Nationally Representative Analysis
Adriane Lesser, MS, Juhi Israni, MS, Tyler Kent, and Kelly J. Ko, PhD
ABSTRACT: OBJECTIVES: To determine whether provid-
ing physical therapy (PT) services in the emergency depart-
ment (ED) improves outcomes for older adults who fall.
DESIGN: We used Medicare claims data to examine dif-
ferences in recurrent fall-related ED revisit rates of older
adults who presented to the ED for a ground-level fall and
whether they received PT services in the ED. Our logistic
regression model controlled for age, sex, Medicaid eligibil-
ity, acute injury, and certain known chronic comorbidities
associated with risk of falling.
SETTING:
We
analyzed
national
2012–13
Medicare
claims data for individuals aged 65 and older.
PARTICIPANTS: This was a claims-based analysis. We
defined an index visit as any ED claim that included an
International Classification of Diseases, Ninth Revision,
Clinical Modification E-Code indicating a ground-level
fall. Visits resulting in admission were excluded, as were
claims associated with an individual who died during
follow-up; 17,975 of the 560,277 claims for eligible out-
patient index visits included revenue center codes for PT
services.
MEASUREMENTS:
We
calculated
the
proportion
of
index visits associated with a fall-related ED revisit within
30 and 60 days and assessed differences in these propor-
tions between individuals who did and did not receive PT
services in the ED.
RESULTS: Receiving PT services in the ED during an
index visit for a ground-level fall was associated with a
significantly lower likelihood of a fall-related ED revisit
within 30 days (odds ratio (OR)50.655, p<.001) and 60
days (OR50.684, p<.001).
CONCLUSION: Expanding PT services in the ED may
reduce
future
fall-related
ED
use
of
older
adults.
Additional analyses could assess characteristics of individ-
uals receiving PT in the ED and follow-up PT use after
discharge. J Am Geriatr Soc 2018.

alls are the leading cause of morbidity and mortality
in Americans aged 65 and older1, resulting in $31.9
billion in estimated direct medical costs to Medicare in
20152. In 2014, approximately 2.8 million older adults
visited the emergency department (ED) for a fall-related
injury1, and an analysis of the National Hospital Ambula-
tory Medical Care Survey determined that the ED visit
rate for falls of older adults has grown over time, from
60.4 per 1,000 older adults in 2003 to 68.8 per 1,000
older adults in 20103. Older adults presenting to the ED
for a fall are at high risk of ED revisits and mortality,
with some estimates indicating that 25% of individuals
presenting to the ED for a fall had at least 1 ED revisit
and that 15% died within the following year4.
There is growing recognition that EDs could play an
important role in implementing contextually appropriate
fall prevention strategies targeting older adults at high risk
of falls3. A range of conditions has been associated with
high fall risk, including history of prior falls5, dementia and
other cognitive impairment5,6, Parkinson’s disease7, depres-
sion5,8, polypharmacy,5,9 certain medications8,10–12, osteo-
arthritis13,14,
anemia15,
various
heart
conditions,
and
diabetes16. Geriatric care experts have recommended that
older adults presenting to the ED be screened for fall risk
and referred when appropriate17. The Geriatric Emergency
Department Guidelines that relevant professional societies
have released advocate for similar management18, although

 a chart review at an academic teaching hospital suggested
that these recommendations are often not implemented19.
Given the prevalence of fall-related ED visits, there
may be an opportunity to reduce fall-related revisits by
offering physical therapy (PT) services to high-risk individ-
uals in the ED, including information, diagnosis, and
referral for follow-up PT after discharge. Several studies
have demonstrated that older adults following a variety of
PT or exercise regimens after a fall can reduce the risk of
future falls20–22, but in spite of these findings, PT assess-
ment and referral services are rare in U.S. EDs,23 and even
older adults who present to the ED for a fall often do not
receive appropriate assessment and referral24.
There is a need for more information on a wider scale
about whether providing PT services and referrals in the
ED improves outcomes. To evaluate this potential, we
used nationally representative Medicare claims data to
compare ED revisit rates of older adults who presented to
the ED for a ground-level fall and received PT services in
the ED with ED revisit rates of those who did not receive
such services.
METHODS
Data Source
We analyzed data from the Centers for Medicare and
Medicaid Services (CMS) distributed by the Research Data
Assistance Center, specifically inpatient and outpatient
ED-only base claims and revenue center Standard Analyti-
cal Files from the 2012–13 Limited Data Sets. Medicare
claims data provide a unique opportunity to examine
nationwide trends in older adult health care in all nonfed-
eral EDs. Medicare claims data from this period include
information for all beneficiaries enrolled in traditional
Medicare plans (Parts A and B), which accounts for a
majority of Medicare enrollment 25.

 Index ED visit
An index ED visit was defined as any claim associated
with an ED visit including an International Classification
of Diseases, Ninth Revision, Clinical Modification (ICD-9-
CM)
E-Code
indicating
a
ground-level
fall
(E880.1,
E884.2, E884.3, E884.4, E884.6, E884.9, E888.0, E888.1)
anywhere in the diagnosis. (We did not require that the
fall be the primary diagnosis.)
Inclusion criteria
We included only outpatient (including observation status)
ED visits for consideration in determining the index ED
visit under the premise that the outpatient population
would derive greater protective benefits from PT services
than the inpatient population (who are probably less likely
to benefit from PT, at least during the short-term period
of this study, given the likelihood of serious injury and
frailty among older adults admitted after a fall).
Exclusion criteria
Claims for individuals younger than 65 were excluded.
Fall-related ED visits that resulted in an inpatient stay
were excluded from consideration as an index visit. Index
visits associated with an individual who died during the
follow-up period were also excluded. (Follow-up periods
of 30 and 60 days were assessed.)
Defining cohorts
Eligible index visits were categorized into 1 of 2 cohorts:
those that received PT services during the index ED visits
and those that did not. We considered the index visit to
have included a PT consultation in the ED if the claim
included at least one of the following revenue center
codes: 0420, 0421, 0422, 0423, 0424, 0429.
Measuring a fall-related revisit
We classified a fall-related revisit as a claim pertaining to
an individual with an eligible index visit that subsequently
had a visit to any ED for which the claim included an
ICD-9-CM E-Code indicating a ground-level fall anywhere
in the diagnosis. Fall-related ED revisits were included
regardless of whether the individual was discharged from
the ED or was later assigned an observational or inpatient
status.
Outcome Measures
Our primary outcome measure was the proportion of 30-and
60-day fall-related ED revisits among patients who received
PT services during a fall-related index ED visit compared to
patients who did not receive PT services during such a visit,
given survival to the end of the follow-up period.
Statistical Methods
We assessed unadjusted and adjusted differences in pro-
portion of index visits with a fall-related ED revisit within
30 and 60 days. Our model excluded
index claims
associated with individuals who did not survive to the end
of the specified follow-up period.
Our adjusted analysis used a logistic regression model
that controlled for beneficiary age, sex, Medicaid dual eli-
gibility status (as a proxy for economic status), acute
injury severity, and certain chronic comorbidities. To mea-
sure injury severity, we calculated the New Injury Severity
Score (NISS) for each index claim. The NISS score ranges
from 0 to 75 and is calculated based on the Abbreviated
Injury Severity (AIS) ICDMAP26. A NISS score of 0 does
not necessarily indicate the absence of injury but may indi-
cate than an injury or injuries are not considered suffi-
ciently acute or traumatic to have the AIS ICDMAP assign
a value. The NISS has been demonstrated in several stud-
ies to provide an accurate estimate of the time it takes for
someone to regain his or her health after an injury27. Our
model also included certain chronic comorbidities that
have been associated with risk of falling: depression5,8;
anemia15; diabetes16; Alzheimer’s disease and related dis-
orders5,6; osteoporosis and osteoarthritis conditions13,14;
and heart conditions, including history of acute myocar-
dial infarction12,28, atrial fibrillation28, heart failure29,30,
ischemic heart disease12, and stroke or transient ischemic
attack31 (the risk from these heart conditions is largely
linked to syncope and some medications associated with
these conditions12,28,30,32). These conditions were flagged
according to the CMS Comorbidity Conditions Warehouse
(CCW), which uses standardized algorithms to identify
certain conditions in the Medicare data. For each claim,
the CCW score was calculated based on information from
claims within the study period that occurred before the
index visit.
To support more robust analyses, we reduced the
number of index claims that did not receive PT to be 10
times the size of the index claims that received PT, in
accordance with accepted statistical methods
33. This
reduction in index claims was achieved through random
selection.
RESULTS
Demographic Characteristics and Unadjusted Results
Table 1 contains a summary of the demographic informa-
tion and unadjusted results for the analysis sample. Of the
560,277 unique outpatient claims for a fall-related ED
visit, we identified 17,975 claims for PT services associ-
ated with an index ED visit, 17,914 of which survived to
30 days and 17,875 of which survived to 60 days after the
index visit. In the control arm of the analysis sample
(179,950
claims),
178,958
survived
to
30
days
and
178,410 survived to 60 days after the index visit. At 30
days, all-cause ED revisits were higher for individuals who
did not receive PT services at the index visit (21.7% of
those who did not receive PT in the ED, 20.4% of those
who did), but by 60 days, there was not an appreciable
difference in all-cause revisit rates between the groups
(30.1% of those who did not receive PT in the ED, 30.0%
of those who did).
For claims with PT services associated with individu-
als surviving to each time point, ED revisit rates for a fall

 were 1.7% within 30 days and 2.6% within 60 days, com-
pared with 2.5% within 30 days and 3.6% within 60 days
for those who did not receive PT service in the ED and
survived to each time point (Figure 2). Chi-square analysis
of the unadjusted results demonstrate a significant differ-
ence in revisit rates for a fall between the PT and non-PT
cohort at 30 and 60 days (p<.001).
The summary demographic characteristics of the anal-
ysis sample indicate some differences between the cohorts.
Mean age of those receiving PT services was slightly older
(82.4) than the control group (80.6). Mean NISS was sig-
nificantly lower in the PT arm (0.20) than in the non-PT
arm (1.21); 94.7% of those who received PT in the ED
had a NISS of 0. The distribution of the full set of princi-
pal CCW conditions are summarized in Supplementary
Table S1. Those receiving PT services in the ED were
more likely to have some chronic conditions, whereas
other conditions associated with fall risk were higher in

the differences between groups were small.
Logistic Regression Results
The results of our logistic regression models are presented
in Table 2. Controlling for specified CCW conditions asso-
ciated with fall risk (NISS, age, sex, Medicaid dual eligi-
bility), receiving PT services in the ED during an index
visit for a ground-level fall was associated with a signifi-
cantly lower likelihood of a fall-related ED revisit within
30 (OR 5 0.655, p<.001) and 60 (OR 5 0.684, p<.001)
days.
Being male and Medicaid eligibility were associated
with greater odds of an ED revisit, with both factors being
significant at the .001 level in the 30- and 60-day models.
Age was not significant in either adjusted model. Of the
CCW conditions in our model, all but atrial fibrillation,
myocardial infarction, stroke, and diabetes were signifi-
cant at the .05 level. (Diabetes was significant at the .10
level.) All significant CCW conditions were associated
with greater odds of a revisit, with the Alzheimer’s disease
and related disorders category having the highest odds of
the conditions examined (OR52.12 at 30 days). NISS was
not significant in the 30- (p5.11) or 60-day model
(p5.79). Because a greater proportion of those who
received PT services had a NISS of 0 (no injury noted)
than of those in the control group, we conducted a sensi-
tivity
analysis
to
determine
whether
the
trends
we
observed held when examining only claims for individuals
with a NISS of 0. The results of this sensitivity analysis
are available as Supplementary Table S2. In summary,
there was some reduction in significance of certain CCW
comorbidities in the 30- and 60-day models, but PT
offered in the ED remained a significant predictor of ED
revisit for a recurrent fall, and the odds of this outcome
were similar (in fact, slightly lower) at 30 (OR50.621)
and 60 (OR50.656) days.
DISCUSSION
Our results suggest that EDs could play an important role
in reducing fall-related ED revisits by linking individuals
who have fallen with appropriate follow-up care, yet data
suggest the likelihood of receiving a PT referral from the
ED after a visit for a fall is rare; only 3.2% of older adults
presenting for a fall-related ED visit received PT services
during that visit according to claims data. To our knowl-
edge, this is the first U.S.-based study in the literature to
report on this metric. (A chart review at a community-
based teaching hospital in Toronto, Canada, found that
only 4.3% saw a physical or occupational therapist during
their ED visit for a fall.)23
A PT consultation in the ED may not always be appro-
priate for an older adult presenting for a fall. Injuries sus-
tained during the fall may preclude a PT consultation
during the ED visit because of location of injuries or pain.
This is reflected in our results, with those receiving a PT
consultation in the ED being much more likely to have a
NISS of 0. In addition, studies have found that PT pro-
grams in older adults are less effective in the presence of
certain comorbidities. For example, the Steps to Avoid Falls
in the Elderly Study (STEPS) in Singapore conducted a pro-
spective randomized trial measuring the effect of a PT inter-
vention that included a program of gait, balance, and
strength training over 3 months after discharge from a fall-
related ED visit and found that intervention success was
lower in individuals with more than 1 major comorbidity21.
A randomized controlled trial found that individuals with
dementia did not benefit from a comprehensive PT inter-
vention implemented after a fall-related ED visit34, and a
systematic review determined that there is lack of evidence
that PT regimens are beneficial for individuals with demen-
tia35. Further research could attempt to determine which
comorbidities present the greatest impediments to likeli-
hood of success of a PT regimen to more effectively target
resources and inform treatment plans.
After accounting for comorbidity, the STEPS program
achieved statistically significantly fewer individuals having
another fall compared to those discharged from the ED after
a fall who were not enrolled in the program. Although the
STEPS program had markedly better odds (OR50.34, 95%
CI50.17–0.67, p5.002) than the current study (which eval-
uated shorter follow-up periods compared to STEPS’ follow-
up period of 9 months), the STEPS program actively imple-
mented a 3-month PT regimen, whereas the current study
measured only whether a PT consultation in the ED was
provided. (The extent of future outpatient PT services ren-
dered was not determined.) This suggests that the odds of a
fall-related ED revisit may be even lower in individuals who
that followed through on PT referral advice received in the
ED. (Future research could investigate this.)
Limitations
There are a number of limitations to this study. Some indi-
viduals presenting to the ED with a fall may not have
been properly identified at index visit if a fall-related ICD-
9 E-code was not recorded. Because these codes do not
independently trigger a Medicare reimbursement, there is
probably a greater tendency for them to be omitted in a
claims database than codes specifically linked to reimburse-
ment. Thus, the absolute number of falls in both cohorts
may have been greater. It is also possible that claims-based
data were less sensitive than hospital records in identifying
follow-up falls, but the fall-related revisit rate at 30 days in
our control group (2.5%) was comparable with the fall-

 related revisit rate after an index fall identified in a study
based on health records databases from 2 hospitals (3.2%).
(That study included individuals who were admitted, who
were probably frailer or with acute injury at their index
fall, which could predispose them to a higher revisit rate.)
We also did not have enough detailed information in the
data to exclude that an ED revisit in our study may have
been related to an unresolved symptom from the index fall
(e.g., back pain); it is possible that such a visit could be
coded as another fall because there is no specific code for
adverse events related to a prior fall. Also, because we had
access to only 2 years of claims data, and index claims
reflected a range of dates in this period, we were not
always able to calculate comorbidities based on the full ref-
erence period that the CMS CCW algorithm prescribes.
Although use of Medicare claims data enables analysis
of a large, national sample at multiple time points, in many
respects, this type of data lacks the level of detail that may
be obtained from various types of records and surveys in
smaller, hospital-based studies such as severity of fall and
any injuries, exact nature of PT services provided (PT proce-
dure codes were not available in the dataset analyzed), and
other potentially relevant contextual factors such as care-
taker situation. Lack of this information impedes the ability
to control for these potentially relevant factors in the logistic
regression model. Likewise, our markers of comorbidity are
limited because the CCW flags only capture presence of doc-
umentation of a set of chronic conditions and does not fac-
tor in severity, and we could not fully account for all other
factors that may have contributed to a person’s status and
likelihood of benefitting from PT services or falling in con-
junction with an ED revisit. For example, we did not have
access to data regarding use of sedative or psychotropic
medications, which have been linked to fall risk8,10,11.
Finally, this study did not assess the extent to which
PT services in the ED were tied to further PT use through

 outpatient services after the index visit, which may be the
most likely pathway through which reduction in future
falls would be achieved. Although our study suggests that
PT services in the ED, limited though they may be, are
independently associated with a reduction in fall-related
revisits, future research assessing what additional PT serv-
ices the person received after the index visit could improve
understanding of the factors influencing the association we
observed. A 2010 systematic literature review found that
14 of 25 studies reported a lower risk of falling after the
exercise or PT intervention under evaluation20, demon-
strating the potential of such regimens but also suggesting
the need for better understanding about which services
and for which populations PT may be most beneficial.
CONCLUSION
In a large, nationally representative sample, we found that
30- and 60-day fall-related ED revisit rates after ED visits
for a ground-level fall were significantly lower for older
adults who received PT services during their index ED
visit than for those who did not. According to our find-
ings, expanding PT services in the ED, including providing
relevant information, diagnosis, and referrals for future
outpatient PT services, may reduce future fall-related ED
use of older adults. Additional analyses could assess this
trend in more depth, including evaluation of outpatient PT
services after a consultation in the ED.
