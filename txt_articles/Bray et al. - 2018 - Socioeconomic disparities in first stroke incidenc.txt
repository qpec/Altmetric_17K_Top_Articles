Summary
Background We aimed to estimate socioeconomic disparities in the incidence of hospitalisation for first-ever stroke, 
quality of care, and post-stroke survival for the adult population of England.
Methods In this cohort study, we obtained data collected by a nationwide register on patients aged 18 years or older 
hospitalised for first-ever acute ischaemic stroke or primary intracerebral haemorrhage in England from July 1, 2013, 
to March 31, 2016. We classified socioeconomic status at the level of Lower Super Output Areas using the Index of 
Multiple Deprivation, a neighbourhood measure of deprivation. Multivariable models were fitted to estimate the 
incidence of hospitalisation for first stroke (negative binomial), quality of care using 12 quality metrics (multilevel 
logistic), and all-cause 1 year case fatality (Cox proportional hazards).
Findings Of the 43·8 million adults in England, 145 324 were admitted to hospital with their first-ever stroke: 
126 640 (87%) with ischaemic stroke, 17 233 (12%) with intracerebral haemorrhage, and 1451 (1%) with undetermined 
stroke type. We observed a socioeconomic gradient in the incidence of hospitalisation for ischaemic stroke (adjusted 
incidence rate ratio 2·0, 95% CI 1·7–2·3 for the most vs least deprived deciles) and intracerebral haemorrhage (1·6, 
1·3–1·9). Patients from the lowest socioeconomic groups had first stroke a median of 7 years earlier than those from 
the highest (p<0·0001), and had a higher prevalence of pre-stroke disability and diabetes. Patients from lower 
socioeconomic groups were less likely to receive five of 12 care processes but were more likely to receive early 
supported discharge (adjusted odds ratio 1·14, 95% CI 1·07–1·22). Low socioeconomic status was associated with a 
26% higher adjusted risk of 1-year mortality (adjusted hazard ratio 1·26, 95% CI 1·20–1·33, for highest vs lowest 
deprivation decile), but this gradient was largely attenuated after adjustment for the presence of pre-stroke diabetes, 
hypertension, and atrial fibrillation (1·11, 1·05–1·17).
Interpretation Wide socioeconomic disparities exist in the burden of ischaemic stroke and intracerebral haemorrhage 
in England, most notably in stroke hospitalisation risk and case fatality and, to a lesser extent, in the quality of health 
care. Reducing these disparities requires interventions to improve the quality of acute stroke care and address 
disparities in cardiovascular risk factors present before stroke.

Introduction
Ischaemic stroke and intracerebral haemorrhage are 
leading causes of non-communicable disease, together 
affecting an estimated 17 million people and contributing 
to 5·9 million deaths globally each year.1 It has long been 
recognised that the burden of stroke is not evenly 
distributed in society, and that major socioeconomic 
disparities exist in ischaemic stroke risk both between1 
and within2 countries. Previous systematic reviews2,3 have 
identified gaps in knowledge of the links between 
socioeconomic status—ie, an individual’s or group’s 
position in society, encompassing a range of factors such 
as income, education, employment, and social status—
and stroke. These uncertainties include whether, and to 
what extent, socioeconomic status is associated with risk 
of intracerebral haemorrhage; whether or not disparities 
exist in the provision of good-quality stroke care; and 
what the causal mechanisms are for the association 
between low socioeconomic status and increased risk of 
ischaemic stroke.2 Addressing these gaps would not only 
help to better quantify and characterise the links between 
socioeconomic status and stroke, but also help to guide 
efforts to reduce the burden of stroke through health 
service development and primary prevention.
Real-world electronic health record and population 
datasets are providing new ways to address these types of 
epidemiological questions at a scale not possible with 
traditional study designs or data sources.4 Using detailed 
clinical data collected and linked to other datasets 
through a nationwide stroke register, we aimed to 
estimate for the whole adult population of England the 
association between socioeconomic status and the risk of

hospitalisation for first-ever ischaemic stroke and 
intracerebral haemorrhage, identify disparities across a 
comprehensive range of acute stroke-care quality metrics, 
and estimate disparities in survival up to 1 year after 
stroke.
Methods
Stroke incidence, care, and survival data
We obtained data on patients with stroke from the 
Sentinel Stroke National Audit Programme (SSNAP), the 
national stroke register of England, Wales, and Northern 
Ireland. SSNAP includes patients admitted to hospital 
with acute ischaemic stroke or primary intracerebral 
haemorrhage. All acute admitting hospitals participate 
and data are submitted by clinical teams via a web-based 
portal with real-time data validation. Overall case 
ascertainment in SSNAP for hospitalised stroke is 
estimated to be 95%, comparing against hospital 
discharge coding and data collected locally by hospitals 
about stroke admission.
Quality of care was measured within SSNAP using 
12 care-quality metrics chosen specifically from key 
indicators reported by SSNAP: thrombolysis with alteplase 
(if ischaemic stroke and presenting within 4·5 h of stroke 
onset); door-to-needle time of less than 60 min for 
thrombolysis; brain scan within 1 h of hospital arrival; 
screening for dysphagia within 4 h of hospital arrival; 
admission to a stroke unit or intensive care unit within 4 h 
of hospital arrival; physiotherapy and occupational and 
speech therapy assessment within 72 h of hospital arrival; 
assessment by a stroke specialist physician and stroke 
nurse within 24 h of hospital arrival; treatment with an 
anticoagulant by discharge or plan to start within 1 month 
of discharge (if ischaemic stroke and diagnosed with atrial 
fibrillation); and discharge to an early supported discharge 
team. For patients having an acute stroke while already a 
hospital inpatient, the time of stroke onset was used in 
place of time of arrival to calculate these quality metrics.
Because this study aimed to describe the incidence of 
hospitalisation for first stroke, we excluded patients with 
a previous diagnosis of stroke or transient ischaemic 
attack. The study cohort included patients in England 
aged 18 years or older admitted to hospital with first 
acute ischaemic stroke or first primary intracerebral 
haemorrhage between July 1, 2013, and March 31, 2016. 
We used a pseudonymised data extract with no patient 
identifiers included.
Mortality data were obtained by information provided 
by clinical teams and via patient-level record linkage to 
the national statutory register of death certification 
records (Office of National Statistics).
Population data and neighbourhood economic status
Age-stratified (in 5-year bands) and sex-stratified mid-
year population estimates were obtained from the 
Office of National Statistics5 to define the size and 
population structure of the denominator population. 
We did this at the level of Lower Super Output Areas 
Research in context
Evidence before this study
We searched PubMed with the terms [“Stroke” OR “Ischaemic 
stroke” OR “Intracerebral haemorrhage”] AND [“Disparities” OR 
“Inequalities” OR “Socioeconomic” OR “Socioeconomic 
status”]. We found three high-quality systematic reviews and a 
large number of primary research studies. The association 
between low socioeconomic status and an increased risk of 
ischaemic stroke is well established and has been shown in 
many previous studies. However, there is conflicting evidence 
on whether socioeconomic status is linked to the risk of 
intracerebral haemorrhage and whether socioeconomic status 
is associated with disparities in care and outcomes after stroke. 
There is also uncertainty about the causal mechanisms between 
socioeconomic status and stroke risk and hence what can be 
done to reduce disparities in risk. We found several previous 
registry-based studies but no studies that sought to describe 
for a whole country the associations between socioeconomic 
status and a wide spectrum of stroke-related outcomes 
encompassing incidence, quality of care, and outcomes.
Added value of this study
We found strong evidence for a socioeconomic gradient in the 
risk of both ischaemic stroke and intracerebral haemorrhage, and 
found that the gradient was steeper for ischaemic stroke than for 
intracerebral haemorrhage. Patients from low socioeconomic 
groups had stroke a median of 7 years earlier than those with high 
socioeconomic status but, despite being younger, had a higher 
prevalence of pre-stroke disability. We found evidence of a strong 
gradient in the risk of ischaemic stroke with pre-existing diabetes 
and to a lesser extent with pre-existing hypertension and atrial 
fibrillation. Low socioeconomic status was associated with poorer 
care for five of 12 care-quality metrics and better care for one 
metric when compared with patients from the least deprived 
areas. Low socioeconomic status was associated with higher 
1-year case fatality, but this association was largely attenuated 
after adjusting for pre-stroke cardiovascular risk factors.
Implications of all the available evidence
This study provides evidence that socioeconomic status is 
associated with the risk of intracerebral haemorrhage in 
addition to ischaemic stroke, that diabetes might be a 
particularly important mediator of higher stroke risk in 
populations of low socioeconomic status, and that pre-stroke 
vascular risk factors might explain apparent disparities in 
post-stroke survival (up to the first year after stroke). Policy 
makers and care providers should address disparities both in 
the quality of health care and in health determinants present 
earlier in life before stroke. These findings have global 
implications in efforts to tackle one of the leading causes of 
non-communicable disease.

(LSOAs; England is divided into 32 844 LSOAs, each 
comprising approximately 1500 individuals). We 
defined neigh 
bourhood socioeconomic status using the 
Index of Multiple Deprivation (IMD), a multicomponent 
measure of neighbourhood deprivation.6 Each LSOA is 
ranked according to IMD score, with 1 being the most 
deprived neighbourhood in England. We aggregated 
the age and population structure of the LSOAs 
according to decile of IMD, and used these deciles for 
the statistical analysis and model fitting. We obtained 
data on included patients’ socioeconomic status by 
linking their postcode of residence to the appropriate 
LSOA, and classified patients by the IMD decile of their 
neighbourhood.
SSNAP has permission from the National Health 
Service (NHS) Health Research Authority under section 
251 of the Health and Social Care Act 2006 to collect 
patient data without prospective consent. Patients can 
opt out of data linkage with the national death register. 
Additional ethical permission was not sought.
Statistical analysis
Incidence rate ratios were estimated separately for 
ischaemic stroke and primary intracerebral haemorrhage 
by fitting negative binomial regression models, adjusting 
for age and sex. We fitted further models to estimate 
incidence rate ratios for the combination of ischaemic 
stroke plus pre-stroke vascular comorbidity (hypertension, 
diabetes, and atrial fibrillation) to explore socioeconomic 
differences in ischaemic stroke risk factors.
We estimated quality of care by fitting multilevel 
logistic regression models with random intercepts to 
take account of clustering at the hospital level. Models 
were adjusted for age, sex, stroke type, onset in hospital, 
time from stroke onset to admission, independence 
before stroke (modified Rankin Scale score of 0–1),7 and 
stroke severity. Stroke severity was measured using the 
admission National Institutes of Health Stroke Scale 
(NIHSS) for patients with complete NIHSS data and 
level of consciousness on admission for the remainder.
We estimated survival up to 1 year after admission (or 
after stroke onset if inpatient at time of stroke) by fitting 
Cox proportional hazards models, using the robust 
sandwich estimator to take account of clustering at the 
hospital level. The proportional hazards assumption was 
checked for all covariates using log–log plots. We fitted two 
sets of models: first, models adjusting only for baseline 
demographic variables (age, sex, and stroke type), and then 
models also adjusting for pre-stroke comorbidities 
(hypertension, diabetes, and atrial fibrillation).
We did all analyses using Stata 14 MP and Python 3.6 
(Numpy 1.12, Matplotlib 2.0, Pandas 0.20).

Results
Over the 33 months of the study, among the 43·8 million 
adults in England, 145 324 were admitted to hospital 
with their first-ever stroke. Of these, 126 640 (87%) 
were admitted with first ischaemic stroke, 17 233 (12%) 
with intracerebral haemorrhage, and 1451 (1%) with 
undetermined stroke type (table 1). The crude incidence 
rate was 105 (95% CI 104–106) per 100 000 person-years 
for hospitalisation for first ischaemic stroke and 
14 (14–15) per 100 000 person-years for first intracerebral 
haemorrhage.
Patient characteristics differed across the socio-
economic gradient. Patients from the most deprived 
areas had a median age of stroke onset 7 years younger

than those in the least deprived areas (table 2; 
appendix p 3). Despite being younger, patients from the 
most deprived areas were less likely to be independent 
before stroke and had a higher crude prevalence of pre-
stroke diabetes than did patients from t he least deprived 
areas (table 2). By contrast, patients from the most 
deprived areas had a lower crude prevalence of pre-stroke 
atrial fibrillation than did patients from the least deprived 
areas (table 2).
Lower socioeconomic status was associated with a 
higher age-adjusted and sex-adjusted incidence of both 
first ischaemic stroke and first intracerebral haemorrhage 
(figure 1; appendix). Compared with people in the least 
deprived areas, those living in the most deprived areas 
had twice the age-adjusted and sex-adjusted incidence 
rate (aIRR 2·0, 95% CI 1·7–2·3) of ischaemic stroke and

with first stroke and pre-existing cardiovascular 
comorbidities (figure 2; appendix p 4). People in the most 
deprived areas had 3·2 (2·7–3·8) times the aIRR of 
ischaemic stroke plus pre-existing diabetes, 2·3 (1·9–2·8) 
times the aIRR of ischaemic stroke plus pre-existing 
hypertension, and 1·5 (1·2–1·9) times the aIRR of 
ischaemic stroke plus pre-existing atrial fibrillation 
(figure 2).
Overall, quality of care was fairly equal, but some 
aspects of care quality varied with socioeconomic status 
(figure 3). We found no evidence of disparities in door-
to-needle times for thrombolysis, swallow screen within 
4 h, specialist physician and stroke nurse within 24 h, or 
physiotherapy and speech therapy assessments within 
72 h. We found moderately strong evidence that patients 
from the most deprived areas were less likely to receive 
thrombolysis (adjusted odds ratio [aOR] 0·89, 95% CI 
0·80–0·99 using the least deprived decile as the 
reference category), have a brain scan within 1 h of 
arrival (0·91, 0·86–0·97), receive an occupational 
therapy assessment within 72 h (0·89, 0·81–0·98), or be 
admitted to a stroke unit within 4 h (0·89, 0·84–0·95). 
Compared with patients from the least deprived areas, 
all groups were less likely to receive anticoagulation for 
atrial fibrillation (aOR 0·64, 0·44–0·92 for the most 
deprived decile vs the least deprived decile; figure 3). By 
contrast with the disparities observed for other aspects 
of care, patients living in the most deprived areas had a 
greater adjusted odds of being discharged to an early 
supported discharge team (1·14, 1·07–1·22; figure 3).
The crude 1-year case fatality rate for the whole cohort 
was 26%. Adjusting for differences in age, sex, and 
stroke type, we observed a gradient in mortality risk 
after stroke, with patients in the most deprived areas 
having a 26% higher risk of death in the first year after 
stroke compared with patients from the least deprived 
areas (table 3; appendix p 6). This gradient was largely 
but not completely attenuated after additionally 
adjusting for pre-stroke hypertension, atrial fibrillation, 
and diabetes, with the point estimates for the hazard 
ratios shrinking towards 1. In the latter model, there 
was strong evidence from the 95% CIs that only patients 
from the most deprived decile had a higher risk of death 
compared with the patients from the least deprived 
decile (table 3).
Discussion
This study drew on detailed registry data to estimate and 
map the associations between socioeconomic status and 
stroke incidence, quality of care, and post-stroke survival 
for the whole adult population of England. We found 
strong evidence that people living in more deprived areas 
have a higher risk of first-ever ischaemic stroke and 
intracerebral 
haemorrhage 
for 
which 
they 
are 
hospitalised and that they experience stroke earlier in life 
than do those in less deprived areas. Having stroke at a 
younger age has major implications for society and 
individuals, affecting individuals’ ability to work,8 earn 
income, and live a life free from long-term disability. The 
association was most marked for the combination of 
ischaemic stroke and prior history of diabetes, suggesting 
that diabetes is an important mediator of higher 
ischaemic stroke risk in populations with lower 
socioeconomic status. Overall the quality of in-patient

acute stroke care provided by the NHS in England was 
fairly equitable, but we found evidence of disparities in 
some aspects of care, including prescription of anti-
coagulation for atrial fibrillation and timely admission to 
a specialist stroke unit, one of the principal indicators of 
improved disability outcomes after stroke. Patients from 
the most deprived areas had lower 1-year survival 
compared with patients of similar age and sex from less 
deprived areas. These differences were largely but not 
completely attenuated after adjusting for three pre-stroke 
cardiovascular comorbidities, implying that apparent 
disparities in survival up to the first year after stroke can 
mainly be explained by differences in vascular risk 
identifiable prior to the index stroke. Reducing socio-
economic disparities would have a major effect on the 
high burden of stroke on individuals and society, and 
efforts to reduce disparities in stroke need to address not 
only access to good quality health care, but also the 
determinants of health and vascular risk earlier in life.
This study is consistent with a large number of studies 
finding that both neighbourhood-level9,10 and person-
level11 measures of low socioeconomic status are 
associated with a higher risk of ischaemic stroke. These 
associations extend across the life course from the 
earliest years, and childhood socioeconomic status and 
education12 are associated with the lifetime risk of stroke. 
Although previous studies13–15 have not consistently 
shown an association with the risk of intracerebral 
haemorrhage, we found strong evidence of a gradient 
in intracerebral haemorrhage risk, albeit not as marked 
as that for ischaemic stroke. Previous studies13–15 have 
included only small numbers of patients with 
intracerebral haemorrhage and so might have been 
underpowered to detect this association. We are not 
aware of previous studies that have specifically estimated 
the incidence of ischaemic stroke plus previous risk 
factors, but increased prevalence of diabetes in patients 
with stroke of lower socioeconomic status has been 
previously reported in a population-based study from 
Ontario, Canada,16 a pooled analysis of three population-
based studies in Australia and New Zealand,17 and a 
nationwide registry-based study from Denmark.11 In 
addition to differences in diabetes prevalence, it is also 
possible that disparities in the quality of diabetes care 
(eg, adequate blood pressure control) might contribute to 
the gradient in stroke risk. We also found evidence of a 
steep gradient in the incidence rate of ischaemic stroke 
plus previous history of hypertension and a more modest 
gradient in ischaemic stroke plus atrial fibrillation. The 
role of these risk factors in stroke aetiology is well 
established,18,19 but our findings imply that interventions 
to improve the prevention and clinical management of 
diabetes might have a particularly large effect on reducing 
disparities in stroke risk.
Previous studies2,16,20–22 have found conflicting evidence 
of socioeconomic disparities in care. Little agreement 
between studies is not surprising because disparities are 
likely to be specific to individual health systems, limiting 
the extent to which findings can be generalised between 
settings. However, previous studies have shown, as with 
this study, that even high-income countries with 
universal health-care systems can have disparities in 
acute stroke care. A nationwide study20 in Denmark of 
14 545 patients found that lower socioeconomic status 
was associated with lower achievement of seven care-
quality processes. Similarly, patients in Sweden with 
lower levels of educational attainment were found to 
have lower odds of receiving reperfusion therapy after 
stroke21 and being prescribed oral anticoagulation22—a 
similar pattern to that found in our study using a 
different measure of socioeconomic status. The only 
previous nationwide study23 in England of socioeconomic 
disparities in stroke care used administrative data to 
describe variation in one stroke quality marker and found 
evidence that the most deprived patients were less likely 
to receive a brain scan on the same day of admission. 
Although five of the 12 quality measures were less likely 
to be achieved in patients of lower socioeconomic status, 
we identified one quality marker (early supported 
discharge) that was achieved more consistently in 
patients of lower socioeconomic status. It is not clear 
why this was the case, but possible explanations include 
differences between rural and urban provision of early 
supported discharge or personal factors (such as having a 
family member at home able to provide support) 
correlated with socioeconomic status. The reasons for 
the observed disparities in care quality are unclear, but it 
seems unlikely that financial barriers to accessing health 
care are a major factor, given that the NHS in England 
provides health care free at the point of use and is 
funded through general taxation. Identification of the 
mechanisms for these disparities would help to inform 
quality improvement interventions to reduce these 
disparities in care.

Our findings of lower survival in the first year after 
stroke with greater levels of socioeconomic deprivation 
are consistent with many20,24–26 but not all17 previous studies. 
We also found that adjusting for pre-stroke vascular risk 
factors largely accounted for the observed socioeconomic 
gradient in survival. This provides evidence that 
socioeconomic differences in post-stroke survival in the 
first year after stroke are driven to a large extent by risk 
factors present before stroke. Simply improving the care 
that patients with acute stroke receive is therefore 
necessary but not sufficient to redress socioeconomic 
disparities in survival and, as with stroke risk, will require 
population-level and individual-level public health and 
behaviour change interventions to prevent and modify 
cardiovascular risk factors earlier in life.
This study has several strengths. To our knowledge, it 
is, by a large margin, the largest ever study of the 
associations between socioeconomic status and stroke-
related outcomes, providing greater statistical power to 
estimate these associations and helping to address 
previous uncertainties in the epidemiology of stroke. It 
has also made use of detailed registry data to describe 
multiple elements of stroke care quality that would not 
be measurable in other big data sources such as 
administrative data. Using a whole country as a sampling 
frame has the advantage of reducing the risk of 
ascertainment bias and makes the findings potentially 
more relevant to policy makers, allowing for whole 
country estimates to be generated and mapped (eg, as 
done in the appendix maps). However, the study also has 
some limitations. First, this study used an area-based 
measure of socioeconomic status rather than person-
level measures of socioeconomic status (such as income 
or level of educational attainment). This means that 
caution needs to be used in attributing group-level 
estimates to individuals (the ecological fallacy). Although 
this study made use of clinically validated registry data 
rather than administrative data, the dataset did not 
contain information about some important stroke risk 
factors,18,19 such as smoking status, body-mass index, or 
physical activity. Outcome data were limited to mortality, 
but we recognise that other outcomes (eg, disability) are 
very important to stroke survivors and would have 
included these had data been available. Similarly, the 
quality metrics largely related to acute stroke care and 
suitable metrics about the quality of community-based or 
follow-up services were not available. We also did not 
have sufficiently detailed (age-stratified and sex-stratified) 
data about the ethnicity profile of LSOAs to take account 
of the effect of ethnicity on stroke risk (appendix). 
Similarly, although the estimated case ascertainment of 
SSNAP is high (approximately 95%), using data collected 
as part of routine care means that case ascertainment is 
less complete than would be achieved by an ideal 
population-based register with multiple overlapping 
sources of notification and a dedicated system of data 
collection.27 The estimates from this study do not include 
patients not admitted to hospital (a previous study28 from 
the UK reported that 12% of patients with stroke were 
not admitted to hospital) or patients with transient 
ischaemic attack: the sum effect is therefore that the 
incidence rates estimated in this study are likely to 
underestimate the total population burden of stroke and 
are lower than incidence studies that include patients 
with acute stroke who are not admitted to hospital.29
In conclusion, we found evidence of a wide range of 
socioeconomic disparities in stroke incidence, quality of 
care, and survival. Tackling these disparities would 
contribute substantially to reducing the burden of stroke 
on individuals and society, and should aim to address 
both the quality of acute stroke care and, to a larger extent, 
the determinants of cardiovascular risk earlier in life.
