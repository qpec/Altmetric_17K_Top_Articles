Overdose Deaths Involving Opioids, Cocaine, and Psychostimulants — 
United States, 2015–2016
Puja Seth, PhD1; Lawrence Scholl, PhD1,2; Rose A. Rudd, MSPH1; Sarah Bacon, PhD1
During 1999‒2015, 568,699 persons died from drug 
overdoses in the United States.* Drug overdose deaths in the 
United States increased 11.4% from 2014 to 2015 resulting 
in 52,404 deaths in 2015, including 33,091 (63.1%) that 
involved an opioid. The largest rate increases from 2014 to 
2015 occurred among deaths involving synthetic opioids other 
than methadone (synthetic opioids) (72.2%) (1). Because of 
demographic and geographic variations in overdose deaths 
involving different drugs (2,3),† CDC examined age-adjusted 
death rates for overdoses involving all opioids, opioid sub-
categories (i.e., prescription opioids, heroin, and synthetic 
opioids),§ cocaine, and psychostimulants with abuse potential 
(psychostimulants) by demographics, urbanization levels, and 
in 31 states and the District of Columbia (DC). There were 
63,632 drug overdose deaths in 2016; 42,249 (66.4%) involved 
an opioid.¶ From 2015 to 2016, deaths increased across all drug 
categories examined. The largest overall rate increases occurred 
among deaths involving cocaine (52.4%) and synthetic opioids 
(100%), likely driven by illicitly manufactured fentanyl (IMF) 
(2,3). Increases were observed across demographics, urbaniza-
tion levels, and states and DC. The opioid overdose epidemic 
in the United States continues to worsen. A multifaceted 
approach, with faster and more comprehensive surveillance, 
is needed to track emerging threats to prevent and respond 
to the overdose epidemic through naloxone availability, safe 
prescribing practices, harm-reduction services, linkage into

§ Natural opioids include morphine and codeine, and semisynthetic opioids 
include drugs such as oxycodone, hydrocodone, hydromorphone, and 
oxymorphone. Methadone is a synthetic opioid. Synthetic opioids, other than 
methadone, include drugs such as tramadol and fentanyl. Heroin is an illicit 
opioid synthesized from morphine that can be a white or brown powder, or a 
black sticky substance.

using the International Classification of Diseases, Tenth Revision 
(ICD-10), based on ICD-10 underlying cause-of-death codes 
X40–44 (unintentional), X60–64 (suicide), X85 (homicide), 
or Y10–Y14 (undetermined intent). Among deaths with 
drug overdose as the underlying cause, the type of drug or 
drug category is indicated by the following ICD-10 multiple

T40.4, or T40.6)††; natural/semisynthetic opioids (T40.2); 
methadone (T40.3); heroin (T40.1); synthetic opioids other 
than methadone (T40.4); cocaine (T40.5); and psychostimu-
lants with abuse potential (T43.6). Some deaths involved 
more than one type of drug; these deaths were included in 
the rates for each drug category. Therefore, categories are not 
mutually exclusive.§§
Age-adjusted overdose death rates¶¶ were examined for 2015 
and 2016 for all opioids, opioid subcategories (prescription 
opioids [i.e., natural/semisynthetic opioids and methadone] 
(4), heroin, and synthetic opioids), cocaine, and psychostimu-
lants in the United States and by age, sex, racial/ethnic group, 
urbanization level,*** and state. State-level analyses included 
 †† T40.0 (opium) and T40.6 (other and unspecified narcotics).
 §§ For example, a death involving both a synthetic opioid other than methadone 
and heroin would be included in both the synthetic other than methadone 
and heroin death rates.
 ¶¶ Age-adjusted death rates were calculated by applying age-specific death rates 
to the 2000 U.S. Census standard population age distribution. https://www.
cdc.gov/nchs/data/nvsr/nvsr61/nvsr61_04.pdf.

31 states and DC that met the following criteria: 1) ≥80% of 
drug overdose death certificates named at least one specific drug 
in 2015 and 2016; 2) change from 2015 to 2016 in the percent-
age of death certificates reporting at least one specific drug was 
<10 percentage points†††; and 3) ≥20 deaths occurred during 
2015 and 2016 in at least two drug categories examined. These 
inclusion criteria were selected to ensure accurate examination 
of death rates and increases. Relative change in age-adjusted 
rates and absolute change were calculated. Significance was 
assessed using z-tests when the number of deaths was ≥100 
(p<0.05) and nonoverlapping confidence intervals based on a 
gamma distribution when the number of deaths was <100.§§§
In the United States, 63,632 drug overdose deaths occurred 
in 2016; the age-adjusted rate of overdose deaths increased 
significantly (21.5%) from 16.3 in 2015 to 19.8 in 2016. 
Opioids were involved in 42,249 (66.4%) drug overdose deaths 
(13.3 per 100,000 population) in 2016, representing a 27.9% 
rate increase from 2015 (Table 1). These increases primarily 
 ††† States whose reporting of any specific drug or drugs involved in an overdose 
changed by ≥10 percentage points from 2015 to 2016 were excluded because 
drug-specific overdose numbers and rates might have changed substantially 
from 2015 to 2016 as a result of changes in reporting.
 
§§§ Z-tests were used if the number of deaths was ≥100, and a p-value of <0.05 
was considered to be statistically significant. Nonoverlapping confidence 
intervals based on the gamma method were used if the number of deaths 
was <100 in 2015 or 2016. Note that the method of comparing confidence 
intervals is a conservative method for statistical significance; caution should 
be observed when interpreting a nonsignificant difference when the lower 
and upper limits being compared overlap only slightly.

US Department of Health and Human Services/Centers for Disease Control and Prevention
were driven by deaths involving synthetic opioids, for which the 
rate doubled from 2015 to 2016 (Table 2). Rates of overdose 
deaths involving prescription opioids and heroin increased by 
10.6% and 19.5%, respectively (Table 1) (Table 2), and rates 
of overdose deaths involving cocaine and psychostimulants 
increased by 52.4% and 33.3%, respectively (Table 3).
From 2015 to 2016, opioid-involved deaths increased in 
males and females and among persons aged ≥15 years, whites, 
blacks, Hispanics, and Asian/Pacific Islanders. The largest rela-
tive rate change occurred among blacks (56.1%) (Table 1). The 
largest absolute rate increases of opioid-involved deaths and 
deaths involving synthetic opioids occurred among males aged 
25–44 years and persons aged 25–34 years. However, deaths 
involving synthetic opioids increased in every subgroup exam-
ined (Table 2). Rates involving prescription opioids, heroin, 
cocaine, and psychostimulants increased for both sexes, whites, 
blacks, and most age groups (Table 1) (Table 2) (Table 3). 
Counties in large central and fringe metro areas experienced 
the largest absolute increases in deaths involving prescription 
and synthetic opioids, heroin, and cocaine; micropolitan areas 
experienced the largest increase in rates involving psychostimu-
lants (Table 1) (Table 2) (Table 3).
Opioid death rates differed across the 31 states and DC, 
with synthetic opioids driving increases in many states.¶¶¶ 
Although several states experienced increases across drug 
categories, in many, the changes from 2015 to 2016 were 
not significant. Rates of deaths involving synthetic opioids 
ranged from 0.9 to 30.3 per 100,000, with the largest rates 
and increases concentrated in eastern states. New Hampshire 
(30.3 per 100,000), West Virginia (26.3), and Massachusetts 
(23.5) had the highest synthetic opioid death rates. Twenty 
states and DC experienced increases in overdose death rates 
involving synthetic opioids, with 10 experiencing increases 
by ≥100%; the largest such increase (392.3%) occurred in 
DC, followed by Illinois (227.3%) and Maryland (206.9%) 
(Table 2). Many states with large increases in synthetic opioid 
death rates also had large increases in rates involving other drug 
categories (e.g., Maryland, Virginia, and DC), including any 
opioid, prescription opioids (Table 1), heroin (Table 2), and 
cocaine (Table 3).
Thirteen states and DC experienced significant increases 
in heroin-involved death rates, whereas a significant decrease 
(56.9%) occurred in New Hampshire (Table 2). In 2016, the 
highest rates were in DC (17.3 per 100,000), West Virginia 
(14.9), and Ohio (13.5). The rates of prescription opioid–
involved overdose deaths significantly increased in seven

states and DC, with the highest rates in West Virginia (19.7), 
Maryland (13.1), Maine (12.5), and Utah (12.5) (Table 1). 
The highest cocaine-involved overdose death rates occurred 
in DC (13.5), Rhode Island (10.7), and Ohio (10.1), with 
15 states and DC experiencing a significant increase from 2015 
(Table 3). Significant increases in overdose death rates from 
heroin, prescription opioids, and cocaine occurred primarily 
in states in the eastern part of the country. Fourteen states 
experienced significant increases in psychostimulant-involved 
overdose death rates. The highest rates were in midwestern 
and western states: Nevada (7.5), New Mexico (7.1), and 
Oklahoma (7.1) (Table 3).
Discussion
Drug overdoses resulted in 632,331 deaths from 1999 to 
2016 in the United States, with 351,630 being opioid over-
dose deaths.**** The epidemic has continued to worsen, with 
deaths increasing from 2015 to 2016 across all drug categories 
examined. Opioid-involved overdoses accounted for two thirds 
of drug overdose deaths, with increases across age and racial/
ethnic groups, urbanization levels, and in numerous states. 
The findings highlight wide state and regional variations. 
Some states (e.g., New Hampshire, Ohio, and West Virginia,) 
experienced the highest overdose death rates across multiple 
drug categories, and others (primarily in the Midwest and 
West) recorded the highest rates of psychostimulant-involved 
overdose deaths. In New Hampshire, although heroin-involved 
death rates declined from 2015 to 2016, deaths involving 
synthetic opioids increased, as they did in most states. In addi-
tion, in some states (e.g., Maryland, Rhode Island, and West 
Virginia), 2016 rates of prescription opioid–involved deaths 
were higher than were those involving heroin. These data 
highlight the persistent and multifaceted nature of overdoses.
The first wave of opioid overdose deaths began in the 1990s 
and included prescription opioid deaths.†††† A second wave, 
which began in 2010, was characterized by heroin deaths (5). 
A third wave started in 2013, with deaths involving highly 
potent synthetic opioids, particularly IMF and fentanyl ana-
logs (2,3,6).§§§§ Synthetic opioid-involved deaths in 2016 
accounted for 30.5% of all drug overdose deaths and 45.9% 
of all opioid-involved deaths, with a 100% increase in the 
rate of these deaths compared with 2015. Synthetic opioids 
propelled increases with 19,413 deaths (more than any drug 
examined), and previous findings underscore the contribution 
of IMF. In addition, IMF is now being mixed into counterfeit

opioid and benzodiazepine pills, heroin, and cocaine, likely 
contributing to increases in overdose death rates involving 
other substances (3,7,8).
The findings in this report are subject to at least five limita-
tions. First, at autopsy, substances tested for, and circumstances 
under which tests are performed to determine which drugs are 
present, vary by time and jurisdiction, and improvements in 
toxicologic testing might account for some reported increases. 
Second, 17% (2015) and 15% (2016) of drug overdose death 
certificates did not include the specific types of drugs involved,

 * Deaths are classified using the International Classification of Diseases, Tenth Revision (ICD-10). Drug overdose deaths are identified using underlying cause-of-death 
codes X40–X44, X60–X64, X85, and Y10–Y14. Rates are age-adjusted using the direct method and the 2000 U.S. standard population, except for age-specific crude 
rates. All rates are per 100,000 population. Cells with ≤9 deaths are not reported. Rates based on <20 deaths are not considered reliable and not reported.
 
† Drug overdose deaths, as defined, that have opium (T40.0), heroin (T40.1), natural and semisynthetic opioids (T40.2), methadone (T40.3), synthetic opioids other 
than methadone (T40.4), or other and unspecified narcotics (T40.6) as a contributing cause.
 
§ Drug overdose deaths, as defined, that have natural and semisynthetic opioids (T40.2) or methadone (T40.3) as a contributing cause.
 
¶ Categories of deaths are not exclusive because deaths may involve more than one drug. Summing of categories will result in greater than the total number of 
deaths in a year.
 ** Data for Hispanic origin should be interpreted with caution; studies comparing Hispanic origin on death certificates and on census surveys have shown inconsistent 
reporting on Hispanic ethnicity. Potential race misclassification might lead to underestimates for certain categories, primarily AI/AN non-Hispanic and A/PI non-
Hispanic decedents. https://www.cdc.gov/nchs/data/series/sr_02/sr02_172.pdf.
 †† By 2013 urbanization classification. https://www.cdc.gov/nchs/data_access/urban_rural.htm.
 §§ Analyses were limited to states meeting the following criteria: for states with very good to excellent reporting, ≥90% of drug overdose deaths mention at least 
one specific drug in 2015, with the change in drug overdose deaths mentioning at least one specific drug differing by no more than 10 percentage points from 
2015 to 2016. States with good reporting had 80% to <90% of drug overdose deaths mention of at least one specific drug in 2015, with the change in the percentage 
of drug overdose deaths mentioning at least one specific drug differing by <10 percentage points from 2015 to 2016. States included also were required to have 
stable rate estimates, based on ≥20 deaths, in at least two drug categories (i.e., opioids, prescription opioids, synthetic opioids other than methadone, heroin, 
cocaine, and psychostimulants with abuse potential). South Dakota was the only state with good or excellent reporting in both years, but with an improvement 
>10 percentage points in drug specificity.
 ¶¶ Absolute rate change is the difference between 2015 and 2016 rates. Percent change is the absolute rate change divided by the 2015 rate, multiplied by 100. 
Nonoverlapping confidence intervals based on the gamma method were used if the number of deaths was <100 in 2015 or 2016, and z-tests were used if the 
number of deaths was ≥100 in both 2015 and 2016. Note that the method of comparing confidence intervals is a conservative method for statistical significance; 
caution should be observed when interpreting a nonsignificant difference when the lower and upper limits being compared overlap only slightly. Confidence 
intervals of 2015 and 2016 rates of prescription opioid deaths for Asian/Pacific Islanders overlapped only slightly: (0.37, 0.57), (0.56, 0.80).
 
*** Statistically significant at 0.05 level.
and the percentage of drug overdose death certificates with at 
least one drug specified varied widely by state, ranging from 
52.5% to 99.3% in 2016. This variation limits rate compari-
sons between states. Third, because heroin and morphine are 
metabolized similarly (9), some heroin deaths might have been 
misclassified as morphine deaths, resulting in underreporting 
of heroin deaths. Fourth, potential race misclassification 
might lead to underestimates for certain categories, primar-
ily for American Indian/Alaska Natives and Asian/Pacific 
Islanders.¶¶¶¶ Finally, state-specific analyses are restricted to 
31 states and DC, limiting generalizability.

The ongoing and worsening drug overdose epidemic requires 
immediate attention and action. Faster access to data collected 
is needed to understand emerging threats in local communi-
ties and to tailor response activities. CDC’s Enhanced State 
Opioid Overdose Surveillance program funds 32 states and 
DC for more timely and comprehensive nonfatal and fatal 
overdose data, including funding for improved comprehen-
sive toxicologic testing to identify emerging drug threats in 
opioid-involved fatal overdoses.***** Syndromic surveillance

 * Deaths are classified using the International Classification of Diseases, Tenth Revision (ICD–10). Drug overdose deaths are identified using underlying cause-of-death 
codes X40–X44, X60–X64, X85, and Y10–Y14. Rates are age-adjusted using the direct method and the 2000 U.S. standard population, except for age-specific crude 
rates. All rates are per 100,000 population.
 
† Drug overdose deaths, as defined, that have heroin (T40.1) as a contributing cause.
 
§ Drug overdose deaths, as defined, that have synthetic opioids other than methadone (T40.4) as a contributing cause.
 
¶ Categories of deaths are not exclusive because deaths may involve more than one drug. Summing of categories will result in greater than the total number of 
deaths in a year.
 ** Data for Hispanic origin should be interpreted with caution; studies comparing Hispanic origin on death certificates and on census surveys have shown inconsistent 
reporting on Hispanic ethnicity. Potential race misclassification might lead to underestimates for certain categories, primarily AI/AN non-Hispanic and A/PI non-
Hispanic decedents. https://www.cdc.gov/nchs/data/series/sr_02/sr02_172.pdf.
 †† By 2013 urbanization classification. https://www.cdc.gov/nchs/data_access/urban_rural.htm.
 §§ Analyses were limited to states meeting the following criteria: For states with very good to excellent reporting, ≥90% of drug overdose deaths mention at least 
one specific drug in 2015, with the change in drug overdose deaths mentioning at least one specific drug differing by <10 percentage points from 2015 to 2016. 
States with good reporting had 80% to <90% of drug overdose deaths mention of at least one specific drug in 2015, with the change in the percentage of drug 
overdose deaths mentioning at least one specific drug differing by <10 percentage points from 2015 to 2016. States included also were required to have stable 
rate estimates, based on ≥20 deaths, in at least two drug categories (i.e., opioids, prescription opioids, synthetic opioids other than methadone, heroin, cocaine, 
and psychostimulants with abuse potential). South Dakota was the only state with good or excellent reporting in both years, but with an improvement >10 
percentage points in drug specificity.
 ¶¶ Absolute rate change is the difference between 2015 and 2016 rates. Percent change is the absolute rate change divided by the 2015 rate, multiplied by 100. 
Nonoverlapping confidence intervals based on the gamma method were used if the number of deaths was <100 in 2015 or 2016, and z-tests were used if the 
number of deaths was ≥100 in both 2015 and 2016.
 
*** Statistically significant at 0.05 level.
 ††† Cells with ≤9 deaths are not reported. Rates based on <20 deaths are not considered reliable and not reported.
data allow communities to identify overdoses quickly (10). 
The State Unintentional Drug Overdose Reporting System 
provides improved collection of toxicology data to identify 
specific drugs involved (6), information gathered from death 
scene investigations, and risk factors associated with fatal 
overdoses. Given the continuing threat from prescription 
opioids and the evolving threat from illicit opioids and other 
substances, a multifaceted prevention approach is required. 
Efforts to ensure safe prescribing practices††††† are enhanced 
by access to nonopioid and nonpharmacologic treatments for 
pain. Other important efforts include increasing naloxone 
availability, expanding access to medication-assisted treatment, 
and maximizing the ability of health systems to link persons 
to treatment and harm reduction services (10). CDC supports

Collaboration with law enforcement, first responders, and 
harm reduction partners is also important to understanding 
local variations in drug supply and lethality and to implement-
ing a multisectoral prevention approach.

 * Deaths are classified using the International Classification of Diseases, Tenth Revision (ICD-10). Drug overdose deaths are identified using underlying cause-of-death 
codes X40–X44, X60–X64, X85, and Y10–Y14. Rates are age-adjusted using the direct method and the 2000 U.S. standard population, except for age-specific crude 
rates. All rates are per 100,000 population.
 
† Drug overdose deaths, as defined, that have cocaine (T40.5) as a contributing cause.
 
§ Drug overdose deaths, as defined, that have psychostimulants with abuse potential (T43.6) as a contributing cause.
 
¶ Categories of deaths are not exclusive because deaths may involve more than one drug. Summing of categories will result in greater than the total number of 
deaths in a year.
 ** Data for Hispanic origin should be interpreted with caution; studies comparing Hispanic origin on death certificates and on census surveys have shown inconsistent 
reporting on Hispanic ethnicity. Potential race misclassification might lead to underestimates for certain categories, primarily AI/AN non-Hispanic and A/PI non-
Hispanic decedents. https://www.cdc.gov/nchs/data/series/sr_02/sr02_172.pdf.
 †† By 2013 urbanization classification. https://www.cdc.gov/nchs/data_access/urban_rural.htm.
 §§ Analyses were limited to states meeting the following criteria: For states with very good to excellent reporting, ≥90% of drug overdose deaths mention at least 
one specific drug in 2015, with the change in drug overdose deaths mentioning at least one specific drug differing by <10 percentage points from 2015 to 2016. 
States with good reporting had 80% to <90% of drug overdose deaths mention of at least one specific drug in 2015, with the change in the percentage of drug 
overdose deaths mentioning at least one specific drug differing by <10 percentage points from 2015 to 2016. States included also were required to have stable 
rate estimates, based on ≥20 deaths, in at least two drug categories (i.e., opioids, prescription opioids, synthetic opioids other than methadone, heroin, cocaine, 
and psychostimulants with abuse potential). South Dakota was the only state with good or excellent reporting in both years, but with an improvement >10 percentage 
points in drug specificity.
 ¶¶ Absolute rate change is the difference between 2015 and 2016 rates. Percent change is the absolute rate change divided by the 2015 rate, multiplied by 100. 
Nonoverlapping confidence intervals based on the gamma method were used if the number of deaths was <100 in 2015 or 2016, and z-tests were used if the 
number of deaths was ≥100 in both 2015 and 2016.
 
*** Statistically significant at 0.05 level.
 ††† Cells with ≤9 deaths are not reported. Rates based on <20 deaths are not considered reliable and not reported.

Summary
What is already known about this topic?
From 1999 to 2015, the drug overdose epidemic resulted in 
approximately 568,699 deaths. In 2015, 52,404 drug overdose 
deaths occurred; 63.1% (33,091) involved an opioid. From 2014 
to 2015, the age-adjusted opioid-involved death rate increased 
by 15.6%; the rapid increase in deaths was driven in large part 
by synthetic opioids other than methadone (e.g., fentanyl).
What is added by this report?
In 2016, there were 63,632 drug overdose deaths in the United 
States. Opioids accounted for 66.4% (42,249) of deaths, with 
increases across age groups, racial/ethnic groups, urbanization 
levels, and multiple states. Age-adjusted death rates for 
overdoses involving synthetic opioids other than methadone 
doubled from 2015 to 2016, and death rates from prescription 
opioids, heroin, cocaine, and psychostimulants also increased.
What are the implications for public health practice?
There is an urgent need to implement a multifaceted, collabora-
tive public health and public safety approach. Building on 
existing resources, more rapidly available and comprehensive 
surveillance data are needed to track emerging drug threats to 
guide public action to prevent and respond to the epidemic 
through increased naloxone availability, harm reduction 
services, linkage into treatment (including medication-assisted 
treatment), safe prescribing practices, and supporting law 
enforcement strategies to reduce the illicit drug supply.
