Viral respiratory infections are usually mild and self-limiting; still they
exceptionally result in life-threatening infections in previously healthy
children. To investigate a potential genetic cause, we recruited
120 previously healthy children requiring support in intensive care
because of a severe illness caused by a respiratory virus. Using
exome and transcriptome sequencing, we identified and character-
ized three rare loss-of-function variants in IFIH1, which encodes an
RIG-I-like receptor involved in the sensing of viral RNA. Functional
testing of the variants IFIH1 alleles demonstrated that the resulting
proteins are unable to induce IFN-β, are intrinsically less stable than
wild-type IFIH1, and lack ATPase activity. In vitro assays showed
that IFIH1 effectively restricts replication of human respiratory syn-
cytial virus and rhinoviruses. We conclude that IFIH1 deficiency
causes a primary immunodeficiency manifested in extreme suscep-
tibility to common respiratory RNA viruses.

V
iral respiratory tract infections are the most common childhood
infections worldwide, with close to 100% of children being in-
fected during the first years of life. Whereas the vast majority of viral
respiratory infections are mild and self-limiting, more severe disease
leads to the hospitalization of about 3% of individuals in each
birth cohort (1). In-hospital mortality rates are limited to <1%
with intensive care support; still these infections account for 21%
of childhood mortality worldwide (2, 3). The main viral pathogens
causing lower respiratory tract infections are human respiratory
syncytial virus (RSV), enteroviruses [including human rhinoviruses
(HRV)], adenoviruses, human metapneumovirus, coronavirus, in-
fluenza, and parainfluenza viruses, with RSV being responsible
for the majority of the hospitalized pediatric cases (4, 5).
A number of risk factors including socioeconomic and environ-
mental influences, preterm birth, chronic diseases, and immuno-
suppression are associated with more severe clinical presentation
(6). However, ∼1 out of 1,000 children without any known risk
factor will require intensive care support due to life-threatening
manifestations of common viral respiratory infections. In the ab-
sence of established differences in pathogen virulence, we hy-
pothesized that human genetic variation contributes to unusual
susceptibility to severe disease due to common viruses. Supporting
evidence is provided by a recent study, which showed that rare
variants in IRF7 resulted in life-threatening influenza in an oth-
erwise healthy child (7).
We combined exome sequencing, transcriptomic analysis, and
in vitro functional testing to identify and characterize potentially
causal genetic variants in a prospective cohort of previously healthy
children requiring intensive care support for common respiratory
viral infections. We report the identification of a pathogen-restricted
immunodeficiency due to loss-of-function variants in IFIH1, which
result in defective innate recognition of RNA viruses, preventing the
activation of an efficient antiviral IFN response.
Results
Study Participants. We enrolled 120 previously healthy children
admitted to pediatric intensive care units (PICUs) with respiratory
failure due to a common viral respiratory infection. The most
common clinical presentation was bronchiolitis (n = 105, 88%)
and the median age was 78 d (interquartile range, IQR: 37–769).
RSV was the most common pathogen, identified in 67 (56%) of
the cases, followed by HRV in 31 (26%) of the cases (Table 1).
Exome Sequencing and Analysis. DNA samples were sequenced to a
mean coverage of 70×, with 96% of exonic bases achieving at least
10× coverage and 78% achieving at least 30× coverage. The final set
of variants included 2,793 stop-gained single-nucleotide variants
(SNVs), 297 splice-site SNVs, and 951 frame-shift indels. Among
these putative loss-of-function variants (LoFs), we searched for
variants that were homozygous in at least one study participant, and
with a higher minor allele frequency in our cohort than in the ge-
nome Aggregation Database (gnomAD) (8) and in an in-house
Significance
Life-threatening susceptibility to common respiratory infections
in previously healthy children can be indicative of pathogen-
specific primary immunodeficiencies due to rare deleterious
variants in key genes and pathways of the immune system.
These findings have implications for prevention and treatment
of susceptible children.

 collection of 485 exomes. Six putative LoFs fitting these criteria
were identified (SI Appendix, Table S3). This set included a variant
in the IFN induced with helicase C domain 1 (IFIH1) gene, which
encodes an RIG-I-like cytoplasmic sensor of long double-stranded
RNA (dsRNA) and plays a major role in innate immune recogni-
tion of RNA viruses (9).
LoF Variants in IFIH1. In total, eight study participants carried
putative LoF variants in IFIH1 (Table 2). Four study participants
carried a rare [gnomAD minor allele frequency (MAF) = 0.64%]
splicing variant, rs35732034 (Fig. 1A): one in homozygous and
three in heterozygous form. We used RNA sequencing to char-
acterize the transcriptomic impact of this variant. We observed
that the minor allele T causes skipping of exon 14 (IFIH1-Δ14)
(Fig. 1B), which results in a frame shift and an early stop codon
in exon 15. The resulting protein lacks the final 153 amino acids
of wild-type IFIH1, including the C-terminal regulatory domain
(CTD), which is essential for binding to viral dsRNA (10) (Fig.
1C). Western blot analyses of peripheral blood mononuclear
cells from the homozygous patient and her heterozygous parents
demonstrated that the IFIH1-Δ14 protein is expressed upon
in vitro RSV infection (SI Appendix, Fig. S1). We identified two
additional rare LoF variants in IFIH1, present in heterozygous
form in a total of four study participants (Fig. 1A): the splicing
variant rs35337543 (n = 3, gnomAD MAF = 0.67%) and the stop-
gained variant rs35744605 (n = 1, gnomAD MAF = 0.32%). RNA
sequencing showed that the minor allele G at rs35337543 causes
skipping of exon 8 (IFIH1-Δ8) (Fig. 1B), which removes 39 amino
acids at the end of the helicase 1 domain and in the linker part
between helicase 1 and helicase 2, but does not result in a frame
shift. rs35744605 is a stop-gained SNV in exon 10 that leads to the
loss of 399 amino acids from the C-terminal end of IFIH1 (IFIH1-
ΔCTD) (Fig. 1C).
Description of Study Participants Carrying IFIH1 LoF Variants. A 16-mo-
old girl was homozygous for rs35732034. She presented with re-
spiratory failure due to RSV infection requiring invasive ventilation.
The disease course was complicated by a pulmonary superinfection
with Staphylococcus aureus. She had a full recovery and did not
develop any other severe infection up to the age of 3. Her phe-
notype and history was otherwise unremarkable. In particular, she
did not develop any complication after live vaccine administration.
Full blood count, Ig levels and IgG subclasses, and lymphocyte
subclasses were within normal limits. Three infants requiring non-
invasive respiratory support for bronchiolitis were heterozygous for
rs35732034. One of these had recurrent severe viral lower respira-
tory tract infections leading to repeated PICU admissions during
childhood. Three children were heterozygous for rs35337543 and
required noninvasive ventilatory support for RSV bronchiolitis.
One infant was heterozygous for rs35744605 and required invasive
ventilatory support for HRV-positive bronchiolitis. Parental DNA
was available for three of the eight children. Targeted genotyping
confirmed that the relevant IFIH1 variant was present in hetero-
zygous form in one of the parents for two heterozygous individuals,
and in both parents for the homozygous patient. Parental medical
history was unremarkable in all cases.
Functional Characterization of IFIH1 Variants. To functionally char-
acterize the identified variants, we first measured the ability of
wild-type (IFIH1-wt) and mutant IFIH1 isoforms to induce IFN
β (IFNβ) in vitro. We transfected plasmids carrying IFIH1-wt,

GENETICS
 IFIH1-Δ8, IFIH1-Δ14, and IFIH1-ΔCTD into 293T cells. Over-
expression of IFIH1-wt, but not of any of the mutant IFIH1 iso-
forms, led to IFNβ induction. Cotransfection of IFIH1-wt with each
of the mutant IFIH1 isoforms showed interference with IFIH1-wt-
induced IFNβ production (P < 0.05, Fig. 2A). We then tested the
ATPase activity of recombinant IFIH1-wt and mutant IFIH1 iso-
forms. IFIH1-wt was able to hydrolyze ATP and showed a typical
dsRNA-dependent increase in enzymatic activity, whereas the
mutant isoforms had no detectable ATPase activity, even upon
stimulation with polyinosinic:polycytidylic acid (polyI:C), a synthetic
analog of dsRNA (Fig. 2B). Furthermore, all mutant isoforms de-
creased IFIH1-wt ATPase activity in a dose-dependent manner, an
interference that was specific to mutant IFIH1 isoforms, as dem-
onstrated by the absence of any effect of BSA on IFIH1-wt ATPase
activity (P < 0.05, Fig. 2C and SI Appendix, Fig. S2 A and B). Fi-
nally, we checked the stability of the various IFIH1 protein isoforms
by performing pulse-chase experiments in transfected 293T cells.
The three mutant isoforms were less stable than IFIH1-wt (Fig. 2D)
and had a negative impact on the stability of the wild-type isoform
when cotransfected (Fig. 2E). Jointly, these experiments demon-
strate that the three putative LoF variants identified in our study
population lead to severe disruption of IFIH1 signaling function,
enzymatic activity, and protein stability in vitro. In addition, the
observations that the mutant IFIH1 isoforms interfere with the
wild-type protein in terms of IFNβ induction, and enzymatic activity
and protein stability suggest a dominant negative role for hetero-
zygous LoF variants in IFIH1.
Role of IFIH1 in RSV and HRV Replication. Viral testing of respiratory
samples showed that six of the patients harboring IFIH1 LoF al-
leles were infected with RSV and two with HRV. To study the
effect of IFIH1 on RSV and HRV replication, we used Huh7.5
cells, which lack endogenous expression of IFIH1 and express
a mutated, inactive form of RIG-I, and thus are completely
unreactive to the RNA pathogen-associated molecular patterns
that normally activate these pathways (11). The cells were trans-
duced with an IFIH1-wt-expressing lentiviral vector, which made
them highly responsive to polyI:C stimulation (SI Appendix, Fig.
S3A) without causing any nonspecific or constitutive activation of
the IFN system (SI Appendix, Fig. S3B). We observed a much
higher level of viral replication in native than in IFIH1-wt-
transduced Huh7.5 cells upon infection with HRV-B14, HRV-

 A16, and RSV (Fig. 3 A–D). Furthermore, RSV replication level
was higher in cells transduced with the mutant forms of
IFIH1 than in IFIH1-wt-transduced cells (P < 0.05, SI Appendix,
Fig. S4 A and B). The role of IFIH1 in HRV restriction was
further demonstrated by
35S labeling of infected cells, which
showed a stronger shutoff of cellular protein synthesis in native
than in IFIH1-transduced Huh7.5 cells, due to higher replication
of the virus in the absence of IFIH1 (Fig. 3E). We also measured
RSV replication in mouse embryonic fibroblasts (MEFs), ifih1(+/+),
and in IFIH1-knockout MEFs, ifih1(−/−), and obtained similar re-
sults (Fig. 3 F–H). Together, these results affirm the central role of
IFIH1 in innate immune recognition of RSV and HRV (12, 13).
Therefore, LoF variants in IFIH1 can be reasonably expected to
increase susceptibility to these viruses.
Discussion
We hypothesized that extreme susceptibility to common viral
respiratory infection in previously healthy children––a rare, po-
tentially lethal phenotype––could reflect an underlying primary
immunodeficiency. Using an unbiased exomewide approach in a
prospective cohort of carefully selected individuals requiring
intensive care support, we identified a rare monogenic defect
predisposing to severe clinical presentations of RSV and HRV
infections.
Three deleterious variants were observed in IFIH1, which
encodes a cytoplasmic receptor critical for viral RNA sensing. It
has been shown previously that IFIH1, alone or in combination
with RIG-I, recognizes and limits the replication of many RNA
viruses including: positive single-stranded RNA (ssRNA) viruses
like picornaviruses (14–16), negative ssRNA viruses like para-
myxoviruses (17–19), and dsRNA viruses like reoviruses (20).
IFIH1 recognizes viral RNA via interaction of its CTD and
helicase domains with long dsRNA molecules. This is an ATP-
dependent reaction that leads to polymerization of IFIH1 mol-
ecules into a filament and assembly of IFIH1 caspase activation
recruitment domains (CARDs) (21, 22). This in turn initiates a
signaling cascade that results in type 1 IFN production and acti-
vation of antiviral genes (23). Our transfection and transduction
analyses show that this process is disrupted in the presence of any
of the IFIH1 rare variants found in our study population. Our
exome and RNA sequencing data predict that the loss of
IFIH1 function is due to loss of the CTD (rs35732034 and
rs35744605) or to partial loss of the helicase domain (rs35337543).
We observed interference between IFIH1-wt and the three
mutant proteins in terms of stability, ATPase activity, and capacity
to induce IFNβ production, suggesting a dominant negative effect,
which provides a rationale for the unusual susceptibility to respi-
ratory viruses observed in heterozygous individuals. The exact
interfering mechanism is not known but could involve physical
interaction between IFIH1-wt and mutant proteins, preventing the
formation of normal, multimeric IFIH1 filaments.
While the revised version of this paper was under review, an
independent study showed an association between IFIH1 deficiency
and life-threatening infections with HRV and other respiratory
viruses in a child carrying another homozygous missense IFIH1
variant (24). This observation further supports a causal role for
IFIH1 deficiency in extreme susceptibility to common respiratory
viruses.
The three IFIH1 variants described in this study have allele
frequencies of 0.32–0.67% in gnomAD. The cumulative fre-
quency of all putative LoF alleles is 1.89% in the same database,
which is significantly less than the 3.75% cumulative frequency
observed in our study population (P = 0.037, Fisher’s exact test).
Nevertheless, the presence of alleles of potentially devastating
consequences at such frequency in the general population is in-
triguing, as they are expected to be removed by purifying selec-
tion. Two nonexclusive mechanisms can explain this observation:
balancing selection and incomplete penetrance. We here show
that some IFIH1 alleles increase susceptibility to viral respiratory
infections, but the same LoF variants are known to be protective
against type 1 diabetes and other autoimmune diseases (25–30),
strongly suggesting a role for balancing selection in their main-
tenance. In a comparable example, rare nonsynonymous variants
in TYK2, a known primary immunodeficiency gene, were shown
to be protective against rheumatoid arthritis (31). Incomplete
penetrance, on the other hand, could be due to modulating ef-
fects of environmental or genetic factors, like compensatory
mutations, or to functional redundancy in innate immune re-
sponse to RNA viruses (32, 33). This hypothesis is in line with
several recent publications (34–37), which suggest that in-
complete penetrance and genetic heterogeneity are likely to be
the rule rather than the exception in severe clinical presentations
of infectious diseases.
On top of their associations with autoimmunity, more com-
mon IFIH1 variants have also been associated with hepatitis C
virus clearance (38). Additionally, rare gain-of-function muta-
tions in IFIH1 dramatically up-regulate type I IFN production,
resulting in Aicardi–Goutières syndrome or Singleton–Merten
syndrome (39–41). At the functional level, Gorman et al. re-
cently studied the effects on viral sensing and autoimmune
pathogenesis of rs1990760, a missense IFIH1 variant that is as-
sociated with multiple autoimmune diseases (30). They showed
that the allele providing better defense against viral infection
also bolsters autoimmune responses against self-RNA (42). To-
gether, these results underscore the pivotal role of innate immune
recognition and activation in the intricate balance between host
defense, inflammation, and autoimmunity.

GENETICS
 Our study demonstrates the power of using an unbiased, exome
sequencing approach to variant discovery in prospective cohorts of
extreme infectious disease phenotypes. Nevertheless, LoF variants
in IFIH1 were only found in a minority (n = 8, 6.2%) of the
120 children enrolled in our study, suggesting that other genetic or
nongenetic risk factors remain to be discovered. Larger sample
sizes will be required to delineate the relevance of other rare
potentially causal alleles. Whole genome sequencing will also be
needed to obtain a more complete coverage of exonic regions
(43), and to explore noncoding and large-scale structural variation.
RSV and rhinovirus infections are the two most common viral
respiratory infections in children. The elucidation of the human
genetic basis of extreme susceptibility to these viruses provides
insight into pathogenesis and innate immune response. An im-
mediate practical implication is the possibility to develop di-
agnostic assays to identify susceptible individuals who could
benefit from specific preventive and interventional measures. By
highlighting the genes and pathways that play an essential role in
host–pathogen interaction, genetic discovery in individuals with
extreme phenotypes also provides the opportunity to design new
therapeutic strategies that could be useful for the vast majority of
patients with milder clinical presentation.
Materials and Methods
Between December 2010 and October 2013, we prospectively enrolled pre-
viously healthy children below 4 y of age suffering from severe lower re-
spiratory tract infection and requiring invasive or noninvasive respiratory
support in five specialized PICUs from Australia and Switzerland. The study
was approved by the respective institutional Human Research Ethics Com-
mittees. Written informed consent was obtained from parents or legal
guardians.
Exclusion criteria were the presence of any significant underlying disease
or comorbidity, including prematurity, congenital cardiac disease, chronic
lung disease, sickle cell disease, hepatic, renal, or neurologic chronic
conditions, solid and hematological malignancies, and known primary im-
munodeficiency. Respiratory support was defined as noninvasive ventilation
including high-flow nasal cannulae (HFNC) and continuous or bilevel positive
airway pressure (CPAP and BiPAP), or invasive ventilation including con-
ventional and high-frequency oscillation ventilation (HFOV). The following
demographic and clinical information was collected: age, gender, weight,
ethnicity, type of ventilation, length of ventilation in days, clinical outcome,
microbiological diagnostic procedures and results including rapid antigenic
test for RSV and influenza, respiratory virus PCR panel, and viral cultures. For
each study participant, we obtained a nasopharyngeal aspirate or endo-
tracheal tube aspirate, 1 mL EDTA blood in vacutainer tubes, and 2.5 mL
blood in PAXgene blood RNA tubes. Samples were immediately frozen at
−70 °C until shipment, and then analyzed in batch.
We generated high-coverage exome sequencing data for all study par-
ticipants (SI Appendix, Table S1). We then used a combination of three
variant calling methods (GATK, Platypus, and SAMtools) and only kept SNVs
and small insertion and deletions (SI Appendix, Table S2). Assuming that
causal genetic variants are likely to be highly deleterious, we focused on rare
gene knockout events, defined as homozygous, putative LoF variants (stop-
gained and splice-site SNVs, frame-shift indels) with an MAF of <1% in the
ExAC (SI Appendix, Table S3). We performed RNA sequencing to assess
the transcriptomic impact of candidate DNA variants, and characterized the
infecting viruses using multiplex PCR assays. We then used in vitro functional
testing to demonstrate the biological relevance of candidate variants and
tested in vivo expression of the affected protein (SI Appendix).
