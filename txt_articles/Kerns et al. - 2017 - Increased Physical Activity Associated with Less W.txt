Objective: The aim of this study was to explore how physical activity (PA) and energy intake (EI) changes
were related to weight loss and regain following “The Biggest Loser” competition.
Methods: At baseline, week 6 and week 30 of the competition, and 6 years after the competition, body
composition was measured via dual-energy x-ray absorptiometry, resting energy expenditure was meas-
ured by using indirect calorimetry, and EI and PA were measured by using doubly labeled water.
Results: Six years after the competition, median weight loss in 14 of “The Biggest Loser” participants
was 13%, with those maintaining a greater weight loss (mean 6 SE) of 24.9% 6 3.8% having increased
PA by 160% 6 23%, compared with a PA increase of 34% 6 25% (P 5 0.0033) in the weight regainers
who were 1.1% 6 4.0% heavier than the precompetition baseline. EI changes were similar between
weight loss maintainers and regainers (28.7% 6 5.6% vs. 27.4% 6 2.7%, respectively; P 5 0.83). Weight
regain was inversely associated with absolute changes in PA (r 5 20.82; P 5 0.0003) but not with
changes in EI (r 5 20.15; P 5 0.61). EI and PA changes explained 93% of the individual weight loss vari-
ability at 6 years.
Conclusions: Consistent with previous reports, large and persistent increases in PA may be required for
long-term maintenance of lost weight.

Introduction
The maintenance of lost weight is an elusive yet important goal of
patients with overweight and obesity, as partial or complete weight
regain remains the most common long-term outcome of lifestyle inter-
ventions (1-3). A very public example was recently provided by our
investigation of subjects with class III obesity who participated in a
single season of “The Biggest Loser,” a televised weight loss competi-
tion (4-6). After losing about 60 kg on average during an intensive 30-
week diet and exercise intervention (5), participants experienced sub-
stantial average weight regain over the subsequent 6 years (4). How-
ever, there was a wide degree of individual variability, with one sub-
ject losing more weight after 6 years, while five other subjects
regained weight to within 1% of their starting weight or more.
What determines successful weight loss maintenance? Previous stud-
ies using self-reported measures have suggested that high levels of
physical activity (PA) decrease the risk of short- and long-term
weight regain after weight loss (7-17). However, self-reported PA
may be quantitatively unreliable, as it typically exceeds PA deter-
mined by objective measurements (18-22) and is poorly correlated
with actual PA (20,21,23). Two studies using accelerometry found
that weight loss maintainers engaged in significantly more PA as
well as more time in higher-intensity activities compared with
weight regainers after several years (24,25). One study used a pro-
prietary multisensor device to show that PA was increased in
subjects with greater percent weight losses over 18 months of a
behavioral weight loss intervention (26).
Here, we report an exploratory analysis of “The Biggest Loser” partic-
ipants (4,5) to investigate the correlates of long-term weight regain.

 Board of the National Institute of Diabetes and Digestive and Kidney
Diseases (ClinicalTrials.gov identifier NCT02544009), and all sub-
jects provided informed consent. Body composition was determined
by dual-energy x-ray absorptiometry in the overnight fasted state.
Body fat-free mass (FFM) and fat mass (FM) were calculated from
weight and whole-body percent fat by using the thick scan mode. All
participants whose supine body width exceeded the dimensions of
the scan window were analyzed by using the iDXA MirrorImage
application (GE Healthcare, Chicago, Illinois) (27).
Resting energy expenditure (REE) measurements were performed
following a 12-hour overnight fast. Participants rested supine in a
quiet, darkened room for 30 minutes before making measurements
of oxygen consumption (VO2) and carbon dioxide production
(VCO2) for 20 minutes, with the last 15 minutes used to determine
REE according to
REEðkcalÞ53:853VO2ðLÞ11:073VCO2ðLÞ
assuming that protein oxidation contributed 15% to REE (28). REE
measurements were available for all 16 participants in a single season
of “The Biggest Loser” at the precompetition baseline, 10 participants
at week 6 of the competition, 16 participants at week 30 of the com-
petition, and 14 participants 6 years after the end of the competition.
The doubly labeled water (DLW) method was used to calculate
the average carbon dioxide production rate (rCO2) at baseline,
week 6, week 30, and 6 years after the end of the competition, as
estimated from the rate constants describing the exponential disap-
pearance of the labeled 18O and D water isotopes (kO and kD) in
repeated spot urine samples collected for 7 days during the com-
petition and for 14 days at the 6-year follow-up. We used the
parameters of Racette et al. (29) with the poolsize, N, estimated to
be 73% of the FFM as determined by dual-energy x-ray absorpti-
ometry measurements that were performed within the same week
as DLW dosing:

where the daily respiratory quotient (RQ) was assumed to be 0.86,
representative of the food quotient of a typical diet at baseline and 6
years. At weeks 6 and 30, daily RQ was assumed to be 0.76 and
0.8, respectively, to account for the contribution from body fat oxi-
dation to fuel usage, as estimated by using mathematical model sim-
ulations (30). TEE data were available for all 16 subjects at the pre-
competition baseline, 11 subjects at week 6, 14 subjects at week 30,
and 14 subjects after 6 years.
Because body weight was stable at baseline and 6 years after the end of
“The Biggest Loser” competition, energy intake (EI) was assumed to be
equal to TEE. During the weight loss competition, average EI was esti-
mated by using the intake balance method (31):
EI5TEE1 dES
dt
The average rate of change of body energy stores, dES/dt, was cal-
culated by using the FM and FFM changes from baseline at weeks 6
and 30 as follows:
dES
dt � 9300 kcal=kg3 DFMðkgÞ
Dt
11100 kcal=kg3 DFFMðkgÞ
Dt
The average TEE for the 30-week period was estimated as the
mean of the week 6 and week 30 TEE measurements. The average
TEE for the 6-week period was estimated by the TEE measure-
ment at 6 weeks. Because the TEE measurements occurring over
week-long periods at weeks 6 and 30 may not necessarily repre-
sent the true mean TEE over the entire 6- and 30-week durations,
the EI estimates calculated by the intake balance method are
somewhat uncertain (31).
PA energy expenditure was calculated as the nonresting energy
expenditure (TEE2 REE) minus the estimated thermic effect of food,
which was assumed to be 10% of EI and was calculated as 0.1 3 TEE
at baseline and 6 years. As previously described (4), we assumed the
thermic
effect
of
food
was
0.1 3 TEEbaseline 2 240
kcal/d
and
0.1 3 TEEbaseline2 180 kcal/d because EI was estimated to have
decreased by �2,400 kcal/d and �1,800 kcal/d compared to baseline
at weeks 6 and 30, respectively (30). Because most PA involves loco-
motion, and therefore has an energy cost that is proportional to body
weight for a given intensity and duration (32), we normalized the PA
energy expenditure by dividing by body weight.
Statistical analyses were performed by using SAS version 9.4 (SAS
Institute Inc., Cary, North Carolina). Data are expressed as mean 6
SE and were analyzed by analysis of variance (PROC GLM, SAS)
with each subject as a fixed block effect. Associations were exam-
ined by using Pearson correlation (PROC CORR, SAS). Significance
was declared at P < 0.05.
Results
Table 1 presents the mean body composition and energy expendi-
ture data for “The Biggest Loser” participants at the precompeti-
tion baseline, at weeks 6 and 30 of the intervention, and 6 years
later. The median weight loss after 6 years was 13%, with the
seven subjects above the median (the maintainers) weighing
(mean 6 SE) 24.9% 6 3.8% less than baseline, while the seven sub-
jects below the median (the regainers) were 1.1% 6 4.0% above
their baseline body weight (P 5 0.0005). The increase in PA from
baseline was significantly higher in the weight loss maintainers
(160% 6 23%) compared with the weight regainers (34% 6 25%;
P 5 0.0033; Figure 1). Weight loss maintainers had a mean PA of
12.2 6 1.3 kcal/kg/d at 6 years, which was significantly greater
than the PA of 8.0 6 1.4 kcal/kg/d in the weight regainers
(P 5 0.04). The percent change in EI from baseline was similar
between weight loss maintainers and regainers (28.7% 6 5.6% vs.
27.4% 6 2.7%, respectively; P 5 0.83).
Across the entire cohort, there was no significant correlation
between absolute weight loss (r 5 0.32; P 5 0.27) or percent weight
loss (r 5 20.004; P 5 0.99) at the end of the competition with the

 respective values 6 years later. The percent weight change after 6
years was not significantly correlated with percent change in EI
from baseline (r 5 0.27; P 5 0.36), but it was significantly correlated
with percent change in PA from baseline (r 5 20.63; P 5 0.017).
The absolute weight change from baseline was not significantly cor-
related with percent change in EI at 6 years (r 5 0.46; P 5 0.10) but
was significantly correlated with changes in absolute EI (r 5 0.54;
P 5 0.046; Figure 2A) and PA (r 5 20.57; P 5 0.035; Figure 2B).
The linear combination of the absolute changes in EI and PA
explained �93% of the individual weight loss variability at 6 years.
Figure 3A shows that EI changes from baseline were not signifi-
cantly correlated with weight regained in the 6 years after the com-
petition (r 5 20.15; P 5 0.61). In contrast, Figure 3B illustrates a
significant inverse relationship between PA changes from baseline
with 6-year weight gain (r 5 20.82; P 5 0.0003). Because most of

weight loss compared to the precompetition baseline was 13%. The increase in
physical activity from baseline to 6 years was significantly higher in the seven
weight loss maintainers (160% 6 23%) compared with the seven weight regainers
(34% 6 25%; P 5 0.0033), while the percent change in energy intake did not signifi-
cantly differ between weight loss maintainers and regainers (28.7% 6 5.6% vs.
27.4% 6 2.7%, respectively; P 5 0.83).

 the weight gain was body fat (4), FM gain at 6 years was also
strongly correlated with changes in PA (r 5 20.82; P 5 0.0003).
During “The Biggest Loser” competition, the weight lost at neither
6 weeks (r 5 0.53; P 5 0.12; Figure 4A) nor 30 weeks (r 5 0.16;
P 5 0.58; Figure 4B) was significantly associated with PA changes.
Conversely, changes in EI were significantly correlated with weight
loss at both 6 weeks (r 5 0.87; P 5 0.0005; Figure 4C) and 30 weeks
(r 5 0.91; P < 0.0001; Figure 4D). EI change at 30 weeks was sig-
nificantly correlated with EI change at 6 years (r 5 0.69; P 5 0.006),
but PA changes were not correlated between these time points
(r 5 0.31; P 5 0.33). Finally, concurrent EI and PA changes were
not significantly correlated with each other at either 30 weeks
(r 5 0.20; P 5 0.49) or 6 years (r 5 0.34; P 5 0.23).
Discussion
Ours is the first study to use the gold-standard DLW method to
measure both EI and PA in weight-reduced individuals with obesity
beyond the first year of weight loss. We found that both the weight
lost at 6 years as well as the weight regained since the end of “The
Biggest Loser” competition were strongly inversely correlated with
changes in PA. These correlations persisted regardless of whether
PA and weight changes were expressed in absolute terms or as per-
centages. In contrast, percent change in EI from baseline was not
significantly correlated with percent weight loss or weight regained
6 years after the competition. However, absolute changes in EI and
PA from baseline both significantly correlated with absolute weight
loss after 6 years and together explained �93% of the individual
weight loss variability.
Only two previous reports have used the DLW method to relate PA
with the future maintenance of lost weight (33,34). Schoeller et al.
showed that higher PA at the end of the weight loss phase was asso-
ciated with less weight regain 1 year later in women who previously
had obesity, but neither PA nor EI was reported at the 1-year time
point (34). Schoeller et al. suggested that a PA threshold of 11 kcal/
kg/d was required to maintain weight loss (34), a value midway
between the observed mean PA of 12.2 6 1.3 kcal/kg/d in weight
loss maintainers and 8.0 6 1.4 kcal/kg/d in the weight regainers who
participated in “The Biggest Loser” competition. The 11 kcal/kg/d
PA threshold for maintenance of lost weight corresponds to approxi-
mately 80 min/d of moderate PA or 35 min/d of vigorous activity
(34). Therefore, a relatively high degree of PA may be required for
the long-term maintenance of lost weight.
The DLW study by Del Corral et al. is more difficult to interpret
because the investigators first split their sample into tertiles of
women according to adherence to a very-low-calorie diet during a
weight loss intervention (33). Highly adherent women had lower EI
1 year after the intervention, and they also maintained greater
weight loss after 2 years compared with women in the lowest adher-
ence tertile. Interestingly, the women with greater dietary adherence
also had lower PA expenditure during the weight loss intervention,
but, subsequently, PA increased in the highly adherent women such
that there was no difference between the groups at 1 year. No data
on PA or EI were presented after the first year. Therefore, in con-
trast to “The Biggest Loser” participants, the highly adherent women
studied by Del Coral et al. (33) maintained greater weight loss after
1 year by reducing EI rather than by increasing PA.
Several previous studies have reported associations between increased
PA and the long-term maintenance of weight loss, but most have used
self-reported measures of activity (7-17). For example, more than
3,600 participants in the National Weight Control Registry (NWCR),
a large observational cohort of self-reported successful weight losers
who have maintained at least a 13.6 kg weight loss for at least 1 year,
reported expending an average estimated 2,621 6 2,252 kcal/wk in PA
to maintain their weight loss (8). A similar observational study looking
at 2,886 NWCR subjects who completed at least 10 years of follow-up
determined that 86.6% of participants were estimated to be maintain-
ing at least a 10% weight loss from their maximum weight at 10 years,
and that those participants who reported large decreases in PA were
more likely to regain lost weight (17).
The Look AHEAD Study, the largest and longest prospective
randomized controlled trial of an intensive lifestyle intervention for
weight loss undertaken to date, reported that 39.3% of 825 subjects
in the intensive lifestyle intervention who had lost > 10% of their
baseline weight at year 1 maintained at least a 10% weight loss after
8 years, while 14.2% of these initially successful subjects regained

 weight above their baseline (15). The subjects who successfully
maintained at least a 10% weight loss at 8 years reported signifi-
cantly more PA energy expenditure than did the regainers.
While the NWCR and the Look AHEAD study have large cohorts
of subjects who have lost weight and had long-term (� 5 years)
follow-up, the use of self-reported PA is a significant limitation.
Three studies have objectively examined PA in long-term weight-
reduced subjects with obesity (24-26). Phelan et al. used accelerom-
etry to compare a group of women who previously had overweight
or obesity, and who had lost and maintained at least 10% of their
maximum body weight for at least 5 years, to a control group of
women who never had overweight and found that the weight loss
maintainers spent significantly more time engaged in PA as well as
more time in higher-intensity activities (25). Catenacci et al. used
accelerometry to compare subjects who had maintained at least a
13.6-kg weight loss (mean 24.7 kg) for at least 2 years (mean 14.2
years) with a group of matched subjects who never had obesity as
well as a control group with overweight (24). Weight loss main-
tainers spent significantly more time per day than controls with
overweight in bouts of moderate to vigorous PA, but no significant
differences were found in other PA measures. Furthermore, weight
loss maintainers did not significantly differ from controls who never
had obesity in total PA time, intensity, or number of PA bouts.
Jakicic et al. used a proprietary multisensor device to measure PA
during an 18-month behavioral weight loss intervention and found
that increased moderate to vigorous PA as well as light PA was
associated with improved percent weight loss at 18 months (26).
We found that PA changes were unrelated to weight losses at weeks 6
and 30 during the intensive diet and exercise intervention. While
increased PA likely contributed to short-term weight loss in the group
as a whole (30), the individual weight loss differences could not be
attributed to differences in PA. In contrast, short-term weight losses
were strongly correlated with changes in EI, suggesting that weight
loss differences were likely attributable to different degrees of EI
reduction. However, it is important to note that the intake balance
method has not been validated under periods of rapid weight loss that
were observed during the 30-week “The Biggest Loser” competition,
and there is a relatively large degree of imprecision for individual sub-
ject energy expenditure measurements using the DLW method during
caloric restriction (35). Furthermore, FM and FFM changes were used
in the calculation of EI at weeks 6 and 30, and these body composi-
tion variables are themselves strongly related to weight loss. Thus, the
calculated changes in EI were not independent of the measured body
weights during the active weight loss phase of “The Biggest Loser”,
and the likelihood of obtaining spurious correlations between changes
in EI and body weight is quite high.
Figure 4 The weight lost at neither (A) 6 weeks nor (B) 30 weeks was significantly associated with physical activity changes from the precom-
petition baseline. Changes in energy intake were significantly correlated with weight loss after both (C) 6 weeks and (D) 30 weeks.

 Other limitations of our study include its relatively small sample
size because of investigating only the participants of a single season
of “The Biggest Loser” competition. We also lack data between the
end of the competition and the 6-year follow up, so the detailed
time courses of weight and energy balance dynamics are unknown.
Despite the extreme nature of “The Biggest Loser” intervention, our
results concord with previous estimates of the overall PA require-
ment for the long-term maintenance of lost weight, and they corre-
spond to increases of about 80 minutes of daily moderate activity or
35 minutes of daily vigorous activity compared to baseline (34).
While these estimates provided by the DLW method provide an
accurate and objective measure of overall PA expenditure, they do
not specify the PA patterns, intensities, or durations that can be
obtained with other methods such as accelerometry.
In conclusion, “The Biggest Loser” participants who were the most
successful in maintaining lost weight had the greatest increase in PA
after 6 years. Our results support previous recommendations that
large and persistent increases in PA may be required for the long-
term maintenance of lost weight.O
