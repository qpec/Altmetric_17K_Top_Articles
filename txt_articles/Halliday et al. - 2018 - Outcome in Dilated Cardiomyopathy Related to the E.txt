ABSTRACT
OBJECTIVES This study sought to investigate the association between the extent, location, and pattern of late
gadolinium enhancement (LGE) and outcome in a large dilated cardiomyopathy (DCM) cohort.
BACKGROUND The relationship between LGE and prognosis in DCM is incompletely understood.
METHODS We examined the association between LGE and all-cause mortality and a sudden cardiac death (SCD)
composite based on the extent, location, and pattern of LGE in DCM.
RESULTS Of 874 patients (588 men, median age 52 years) followed for a median of 4.9 years, 300 (34.3%) had
nonischemic LGE. Estimated adjusted hazard ratios for patients with an LGE extent of 0 to 2.55%, 2.55% to 5.10%, and
>5.10%, respectively, were 1.59 (95% confidence interval [CI]: 0.99 to 2.55), 1.56 (95% CI: 0.96 to 2.54), and 2.31 (95%
CI: 1.50 to 3.55) for all-cause mortality, and 2.79 (95% CI: 1.42 to 5.49), 3.86 (95% CI: 2.09 to 7.13), and 4.87 (95% CI:
2.78 to 8.53) for the SCD end-point. There was a marked nonlinear relationship between LGE extent and outcome such
that even small amounts of LGE predicted a substantial increase in risk. The presence of septal LGE was associated with
increased mortality, but SCD was most associated with the combined presence of septal and free-wall LGE. Predictive
models using LGE presence and location were superior to models based on LGE extent or pattern.
CONCLUSIONS In DCM, the presence of septal LGE is associated with a large increase in the risk of death and SCD
events, even when the extent is small. SCD risk is greatest with concomitant septal and free-wall LGE. The incremental
value of LGE extent beyond small amounts and LGE pattern is limited. (J Am Coll Cardiol Img 2018;-:-–-) © 2018 The

espite advances in therapy, out-
comes in dilated cardiomyopathy
(DCM) remain poor (1). DCM is a
heterogeneous disease affecting a diverse
group of patients and response to therapy is
varied (2). Precise phenotyping, enabling tar-
geted
and
personalized
management
to
improve outcomes and avoid unnecessary in-
terventions remains a therapeutic goal (3).
Late
gadolinium
enhancement
(LGE)-
cardiovascular
magnetic
resonance
(CMR)
detects nonischemic LGE in approximately
30%
of
patients,
which
correlates
with
replacement fibrosis on histology (1,4). LGE provides
incremental value in addition to left ventricular
ejection
fraction
(LVEF)
for
predicting
all-cause
mortality and sudden cardiac death (SCD) events;
therefore, it has the potential to guide therapy such as
during
the
selection
of
patients
for
implantable
cardioverter-defibrillators (ICDs) (1,4).
Nonischemic LGE most often occurs in a linear
pattern in the mid-wall of the septum; however, sub-
epicardial patterns and LGE occurring in the free-wall
of the left ventricle (LV) are also recognized. The
nature of the dose-response relationship between
LGE and outcome is poorly understood. Data exam-
ining
the
association
between
the
location
and
pattern of LGE and specific clinical outcomes are also
lacking. Identifying an amount, location, or pattern of
LGE that provides the optimal mode of risk stratifi-
cation will help guide the use of this technique in
clinical practice.
METHODS
Consecutive patients with DCM referred to our unit
between 2000 and 2011 were screened for a registry.
All participants provided written informed consent
and the study was approved by the National Research
Ethics Service. The diagnosis of DCM was confirmed
using the World Health Organization/International
Society
and
Federation
of
Cardiology
definition,
based on reduced LVEF and elevated LV end-diastolic
volume indexed to body surface area (BSA) (LVEDVi),
compared to published age- and sex-specific refer-
ence values (5). Exclusion criteria (Figure 1) included
ischemic heart disease, defined as a stenosis of >50%
in a major coronary artery or evidence of inducible
ischemia on functional testing; evidence of acute
myocarditis, or ongoing inflammatory myocardial
disease; hypertrophic cardiomyopathy; arrhythmo-
genic right ventricular cardiomyopathy; significant
valve disease; and infiltrative disease. In keeping
with
guidelines
(6,7),
an
ischemic
etiology
was
considered in all patients and ruled out as follows: All
those with infarct patterns of LGE were excluded.
Additionally, 681 (77.9%) underwent coronary angi-
ography and 63 (7.2%) perfusion imaging or stress
echocardiography without provocation of ischemia.
All of the remaining patients (n ¼ 130) were free of
angina and considered to have a low risk of ischemic
heart disease by their attending cardiologists; the
majority (n ¼ 82) were 40 years of age or younger. In
the absence of a class 1 indication, coronary angiog-
raphy was not performed (6,7). None of these patients
underwent coronary revascularization or suffered an
acute coronary syndrome during follow-up. The final
cohort included 682 from previous studies, all of
whom underwent extended follow-up for this study
(1,4).
CMR was performed on a 1.5-T system (Sonata/
Avanto, Siemens, Erlangen, Germany) using a stan-
dardized protocol (4). Late gadolinium imaging was
performed 10 min after intravenous injection of 0.1
mmol/kg of gadopentetate dimeglumine or gadobu-
trol (Bayer AG, Berlin, Germany) using an inversion-
recovery
gradient
echo
sequence.
Images
were
acquired in standard long-axis planes and consecu-
tive short axis slices (8-mm slice thickness with 2-mm
gap) in 2-phase encoding directions. Inversion times
were optimized to null the myocardium. Ventricular
volumes and mass and left atrial volumes were
calculated using dedicated software (CMRtools, Car-
diovascular
Imaging
Solutions,
London,
United
Kingdom) and indexed to BSA. The presence of non-
ischemic LGE was determined by two independent
operators, with a third providing adjudication if
necessary. LGE was considered present if seen in both
long- and short-axis planes, in 2 phase-encoding di-
rections, and extending beyond the localized ven-
tricular insertion areas. A senior operator categorized
the location and pattern of LGE. The location was
classified as septal, LV free-wall, or as occurring in
both locations. The pattern was classified as linear
mid-wall, sub-epicardial, focal, or as occurring in
multiple patterns. LGE quantification was performed
by 2 senior operators using the full width at half
maximum
method
(CMR42,
Circle
Cardiovascular
Imaging Inc., Calgary, Canada).
Patients were followed-up from baseline using
questionnaires and telephone interviews, and by
gathering information from family physicians, cardi-
ologists, and hospital records. Deaths were confirmed
using the UK Health and Social Care Information
Service. Follow-up time was calculated from the
baseline scan until an endpoint occurred or last con-
tact with the patient. All outcome events were adju-
dicated by a committee of cardiologists blinded to

 CMR data. The primary outcome of interest was all-
cause mortality. The cause of death was confirmed
from a combination of medical records, death certi-
fication, and post-mortem results using American
College of Cardiology/American Heart Association
guidance (8). The secondary endpoint was an SCD
composite including SCD and aborted SCD. SCD was
defined as “unexpected death either within 1 h of the
onset of cardiac symptoms in the absence of pro-
gressive cardiac deterioration; during sleep; or within
24 h of last being seen alive” (9). Aborted SCD was
defined as “an appropriate ICD shock for ventricular
arrhythmia, successful resuscitation following ven-
tricular fibrillation or spontaneous sustained ven-
tricular
tachycardia
causing
hemodynamic
compromise and requiring cardioversion” (8).
STATISTICAL ANALYSIS. To examine the association
between LGE extent and outcome, patients with LGE
were classified based on the percentage of total
myocardial mass occupied by LGE to produce equal
tertiles of LGE (>0 and <2.55%, $2.55% and <5.10%,
and $5.10%). Baseline characteristics were compared
using the Kruskal-Wallis rank test for continuous
data and the Fisher exact test for categorical data.
The associations between the extent, location, and
pattern of LGE were examined using proportional
hazard modelling. Models were adjusted for LVEF,
age, and sex given the potential to confound the
association between LGE and outcome. As part of a
sensitivity analysis, the models were also adjusted
for LVEF, age, sex, right ventricular ejection fraction
(RVEF), New York Heart Association (NYHA) func-
tional class, LVEDVi, LV mass index, and indexed
left atrial volume (LAVi). Results are presented as
hazard ratios (HRs) with 95% confidence intervals
(CIs). A p value of <0.05 was considered significant.
A cubic spline model was fitted to the observed data
examining the association between LGE extent and
outcome. The cutoff percentage extent of LGE giving
the largest C-statistic for the prediction of each end-
point was calculated from 1,000 bootstrap samples.
The concordance statistic (C-statistic) measured the
degree to which a model can distinguish between
cases and controls, taking values between 0.5 and
1.0, with larger values indicating better discrimina-
tion. The Akaike information criterion (AIC) was used
to compare models (10). The AIC allows comparison
of nested and non-nested models and reduces the
potential of over-fitting the data. Smaller values
indicate the optimal model. Interobserver variability
in LGE quantification was examined in a random
sample of 60 patients with LGE who had quantifica-
tion performed by both operators, including 20 from
each of the group based on extent. The intraclass
correlation coefficient was calculated for continuous
variables and the Kappa coefficient for categorical
variables.
RESULTS
The final cohort comprised 874 patients, of whom 588
(67.3%) were men, the median LVEF was 39% (inter-
quartile range: 29% to 50%), and nonischemic LGE
was present in 300 (34.3%). Baseline characteristics
are presented in Table 1. Patients with LGE were older
(p ¼ 0.023), more likely to be men (p < 0.0001), and
prescribed loop diuretics (p < 0.0001) or mineralo-
corticoid receptor antagonists (p ¼ 0.008), had lower
systolic pressures (p ¼ 0.010) and diastolic blood
pressures (p ¼ 0.026), worse NYHA functional class
(p ¼ 0.010), lower LVEF (p < 0.0001), and greater
LVEDVi (p < 0.0001).
LGE was present only in the septum in 142 (16.2%)
cases, only in the LV free-wall in 42 (4.8%), and in
both locations in 116 (13.3%) (Figure 2). LGE was

 categorized as linear mid-wall in 185 (21.1%) cases,
sub-epicardial in 25 (2.9%), focal in 22 (2.5%), and as
occurring in multiple patterns in a further 68 (7.8%)
(Figure 2).
There was agreement between 2 operators on the
presence of LGE in 94.7% of cases (n ¼ 828). There
was an absolute mean difference of 0.87% between
operators in the quantification of the extent of LGE
(intraclass
correlation
coefficient:
0.87)
(Online
Figure 1, Online Table 1). Additionally, there was
86.7% agreement in categorizing the LGE extent
within 3 groups (>0 and <2.55%, $2.55% and <5.10%,
and
$5.10%)
(Kappa
coefficient:

(Online

ALL-CAUSE MORTALITY. Over a median follow-up of
4.9 years (interquartile range: 3.5 to 7.0 years), 150
patients (17.2%) died including 77 (25.7%) with LGE
and 73 (12.7%) without (HR: 2.39; 95% CI: 1.73 to 3.29;
p < 0.001) (Online Figure 2A). Following adjustment
for LVEF, age, and sex, LGE was associated with
greater all-cause mortality (HR: 1.81; 95% CI: 1.30 to
2.52; p < 0.001) (Online Table 3). The estimated HRs
were similar after additionally adjusting for RVEF,
NYHA class, LVEDVi, LV mass index, and LAVi as part
of a sensitivity analysis (Online Tables 3 and 4, Online
Figure 3).

 >5.10% were 1.59 (95% CI: 0.99 to 2.55; p ¼ 0.056),
1.56 (95% CI: 0.96 to 2.54; p ¼ 0.072), and 2.31 (95%
CI: 1.50 to 3.55; p < 0.001), respectively, compared to
those without LGE (Figures 3 and 4, Online Figure 2B).
Modelling LGE as a linear measure, per percentage
increase in extent, underestimated risk in most pa-
tients while overestimating risk in the small propor-
tion
of
patients
with
the
largest
extent
(Online
Figure 4). The percentage extent of LGE giving the
largest C-statistic for the primary endpoint was 1.29%
(C-statistic: 0.70).
Location of LGE. Patients with LGE only in the septum,
only in the free-wall, and in both locations had
adjusted HRs for the primary endpoint of 1.96 (95%
CI: 1.32 to 2.92; p < 0.001), 0.77 (95% CI: 0.28 to 2.12;
p ¼ 0.77), and 1.99 (95% CI: 1.30 to 3.04; p ¼ 0.002),
compared to those without LGE (Figure 4, Online
Figure 2C). A simplified model showed that those
patients with septal LGE had an estimated adjusted
HR of 2.00 (95% CI: 1.43 to 2.81; p < 0.0001) compared
to those without septal LGE (Figure 4).
Pattern of LGE. Estimated adjusted HRs for patients
with linear mid-wall, sub-epicardial, focal, and mul-
tiple patterns of enhancement were 1.70 (95% CI: 1.17
to 2.49; p ¼ 0.006), 1.29 (95% CI: 0.47 to 3.57; p ¼
0.62), 2.85 (95% CI: 1.30 to 6.23; p ¼ 0.009), and 2.00
(95% CI: 1.20 to 3.34; p ¼ 0.008), respectively,
compared to those patients without LGE (Figure 4,
Online Figure 2D).
The model with the smallest AIC and the most
effective for the prediction of the primary endpoint
was based on the presence of septal LGE (Table 2).
This was superior to those based on extent or pattern
of LGE and the LGE cutoff with the largest C-statistic
for the prediction of the primary endpoint. Adding
the presence of any LGE and the presence of septal
LGE to the baseline multivariable models without
LGE improved the C-statistic for the prediction of all-
cause mortality (Online Table 3).
SCD AND ABORTED SCD. Overall, 84 patients (9.6%)
suffered SCD or aborted SCD, including 55 patients
(18.3%) with LGE and 29 (5.1%) without (HR: 4.12; 95%
CI: 2.64 to 6.45; p < 0.001) (Online Figure 5A).
Following adjustment for LVEF, age, and sex, LGE
was associated with SCD and aborted SCD (HR: 3.96;
95% CI: 2.41 to 6.52; p < 0.001) (Online Table 5). The
estimated HRs were similar following adjustment for
additional covariates as part of a sensitivity analysis
(Online Tables 5 and 6, Online Figure 6).
Extent of LGE. Estimated adjusted HRs for patients
with LGE extents of 0 to 2.55%, 2.55% to 5.10%, and
>5.10%, respectively, were 2.79 (95% CI: 1.42 to 5.49;
p ¼ 0.003), 3.86 (95% CI: 2.09 to 7.13; p < 0.0001), and
4.87 (95% CI: 2.78 to 8.53; p < 0.0001), compared to
patients
without
LGE
(Figures
3
and
4,
Online
Figure 5B). Modelling LGE as a linear measure, per
percentage increase in extent, underestimated risk in
most patients while vastly overestimating risk in the
proportion of patients with the largest extent (Online
Figure 7). The percentage extent of LGE giving the
largest C-statistic for the prediction of the arrhythmic
endpoint was 0.71% (C-statistic: 0.70).
Location of LGE. Patients with LGE in the septum (HR:
3.13; 95% CI: 1.68 to 5.81; p < 0.001) and in both the
septum and free-wall (HR: 5.82; 95% CI: 3.30 to 10.27;
p
<
0.0001)
had
greater
incidence
of
the
SCD
endpoint
compared
to
patients
without
LGE.
Although there was a weaker trend towards increased
events in patients with LGE only occurring in the free-
wall, this did not reach statistical significance (HR:
2.19; 95% CI: 0.76 to 6.31; p ¼ 0.15) (Figure 4, Online
Figure 5C).
Pattern of LGE. Estimated adjusted HRs for patients
with linear mid-wall, sub-epicardial, focal, and mul-
tiple patterns of enhancement were 3.21 (95% CI: 1.82

(95% CI: 3.06 to 10.69; p < 0.0001), respectively,
compared to those patients without LGE (Figure 4,
Online Figure 5D).
Overall, the model with the smallest AIC that best
predicted the SCD endpoint was based on the pres-
ence and location of LGE within the septum, the free-
wall, or in both locations (Table 3). This was superior
to models based on extent and pattern of LGE. Adding
the presence of any LGE and the presence of LGE by
location to the baseline multivariable models without
LGE improved the C-statistic for the prediction of the
SCD composite (Online Table 5).
DISCUSSION
This is the largest study to date to examine the as-
sociation between the extent, location, and pattern of
LGE and outcome in a large, well-phenotyped DCM
cohort. We show the superiority of models based on
the presence and location of LGE for the prediction of
all-cause mortality and SCD events over those based
on LGE extent and pattern (Figure 5). Our data also
establish a nonlinear association between LGE extent
and outcome, with a large increase in risk with small
degrees of
LGE and less marked increases with
greater extents thereafter (Figure 5). The increase in
risk with small amounts of LGE was most marked for
SCD events (Figure 3).
Previous studies have shown that nonischemic LGE
is associated with an increased risk of death and
arrhythmic events (1,11). It has been proposed that
LGE-CMR may be able to improve the selection of
patients who benefit from ICD implantation (12).
However, up until now there has been a paucity of
data examining the relationship between LGE extent,
location, pattern, and specific outcomes.
Our data suggest that measures based on LGE
location are better than those based on extent for risk
prediction. We show that patients with septal LGE
were at highest risk of death whereas those with free-
wall LGE were at similar risk to those without LGE.
Accordingly, a model based on the presence of septal
LGE
best
predicted
all-cause
mortality.
Whereas
septal LGE was also associated with increased SCD
events, the greatest risk was seen with concomitant
septal and free-wall LGE. A model accounting for the
greater risk associated with concomitant LGE in the
septum and free-wall was most effective for SCD.
Additionally, sub-epicardial or multiple patterns of
LGE were associated with a high-risk of SCD events.
These data add important new information on how to
best to use LGE-CMR in risk stratification, an area of
unmet need (12,13).
Similar to our results, septal LGE has been associ-
ated with worse prognosis in myocarditis (14). The
variation in risk based on location may be explained
by differences in etiological substrate, scar micro-
structure, and geographical effects. Idiopathic DCM is
most commonly associated with septal mid-wall LGE
whereas a previous episode of myocarditis, the cause
of a third of DCM, is often associated with free-wall

 LGE (15). Different insults may create fibrosis with
different microstructures and varying levels of risk.
Septal LGE also has greater interaction with the right
ventricle and the conduction system.
Inherited cardiomyopathies may have contributed
to the increased risk of SCD events associated with
sub-epicardial
or
multiple
patterns
of
LGE
and
concomitant LGE in the septum and free-wall. For
example, lamin cardiomyopathies are characterized
by mid-wall and sub-epicardial LGE in multiple loca-
tions and are associated with malignant arrhythmias
(16,17). It is recognized that LV forms of arrhythmo-
genic cardiomyopathy constitute part of the DCM
spectrum (16). Although cases of suspected arrhyth-
mogenic
right
ventricular
cardiomyopathy
were
excluded, it is possible that our cohort included left-
dominant disease, characterized by sub-epicardial
fibrofatty
replacement.
This
reflects
“real-world”
clinical
populations.
Genetic
substrate
and
fatty
infiltration are likely to predispose to arrhythmias in
this group (18).
We also show a nonlinear relationship between
LGE extent and outcome, such that small degrees of
fibrosis are associated with a large increase in risk,
particularly with regards to SCD events. This may be
explained
by
the
multifactorial
disease
process.
Replacement
fibrosis
is
1
of
several
processes
contributing to ventricular arrhythmogenesis (3). It is
likely that the synergistic presence of multiple fea-
tures leads to ventricular arrhythmia rather than 1
factor in a linear dose-dependent manner. In addi-
tion, it appears that risk is influenced by fibrosis
microstructure and heterogeneity, not simply mass.
Areas of scar with the greatest heterogeneity will
cause the largest variation in conduction velocities
and
the
greatest
chance
of
creating
re-entrant
arrhythmia. Computational scar modelling offers the
potential to provide important insights (19).
Localized LGE at the ventricular insertion areas is
common, even in healthy volunteers. What this rep-
resents and its significance is uncertain. Examining
this was beyond the scope of this study; therefore,
localized LGE at the ventricular insertion areas was
not
included.
Quantifying
the
“gray-zone”
sur-
rounding an area of replacement fibrosis was pro-
posed in the context of myocardial infarction (20).
There is a lack of histologic correlation examining this
concept in DCM. Given the ambiguity over what this
technique measures in DCM, we chose not to include
it in our analysis.
STUDY LIMITATIONS. Single-center studies are sus-
ceptible to selection bias. However, our registry in-
cludes patients with a complete spectrum of disease
severity referred from secondary and tertiary centers
for a range of common indications. In addition, the
baseline characteristics are similar to other studies
(2). Although data from a proportion of patients have
been presented in previous studies (1,4), patients in
this larger cohort had extended follow-up for this
investigation. The large number of patients and
events affords greater statistical power and enables
the investigation of multiple statistical models. The

Relevance to Mortality Risk
Relevance to SCD Risk
Our study of dilated cardiomyopathy patients shows a nonlinear relationship between late gadolinium enhancement (LGE) extent and all-cause mortality
and sudden cardiac death (SCD) events with a large increase in risk with small degrees of LGE. We show the superiority of models based on the location of
LGE for the prediction of these end-points. DCM ¼ dilated cardiomyopathy; other abbreviations as in Figure 3.

 smaller number of patients in sub-groups such as
those with focal or sub-epicardial LGE does, however,
limit the interpretation of this specific data.
We recognize that not all arrhythmias resulting in
appropriate shocks may have resulted in SCD if un-
treated. However, we have selected the most robust
definition available, excluding antitachycardia pacing
(8). We acknowledge that the use of different contrast
agents has the potential to impact LGE quantification.
However, there was no difference in the quantity,
pattern, or location of LGE for patients scanned with
gadobutrol compared to gadopentetate dimeglumine.
In
addition,
the
associations
between
LGE
and
outcome remain similar when patients are divided
based on contrast agent and there was no difference
in the estimated effect of LGE on outcome between
groups (Online Table 7). The impact of the use of
different contrast agents on the results of the study,
therefore, appears to be minimal.
Parametric mapping was not available at the outset
of the current study and was therefore not included in
the analysis. This technique has the advantage of
identifying diffuse myocardial changes which LGE
imaging may not detect. Previous work has shown as-
sociations between native T1 values and mortality and
heart failure outcomes in DCM (21). Given the possible
role of diffuse fibrosis in arrhythmia generation and
heart failure, parametric mapping offers hope in the
identification of those at risk of adverse outcomes. We
eagerly await further data examining the incremental
value of parametric mapping. Our data suggest the
need to examine the incremental value of this tech-
nique in addition to the presence of septal LGE.
CONCLUSIONS
We show a large increase in all-cause mortality and
SCD risk with small amounts of LGE. The incremental
value of LGE extent is therefore limited. In addition,
we show that septal LGE is associated with all-cause
mortality and concomitant LGE in the septum and
free-wall is associated with the greatest risk of SCD
events.

PERSPECTIVES
COMPETENCY IN MEDICAL KNOWLEDGE: The
presence of even small degrees of LGE is associated
with an increased risk of death and SCD events. The
presence of septal LGE is the best marker of mortality
risk whilst the presence of concomitant LGE in the
septum and free-wall confers the highest risk of SCD
events.
TRANSLATIONAL OUTLOOK: Randomized trials
are needed to investigate whether patients with LGE
gain benefit from targeted therapies, such as ICD im-
