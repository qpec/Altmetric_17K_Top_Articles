abstract
OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the change in the diagnosis of attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder 
(ADHD) and prescribing of stimulants to children 4 to 5 years old after release of the 2011 
American Academy of Pediatrics guideline.
METHODS: Electronic health record data were extracted from 63 primary care practices. 
We included preventive visits from children 48 to 72 months old receiving care from January 
2008 to July 2014. We compared rates of ADHD diagnosis and stimulant prescribing before 
and after guideline release using logistic regression with a spline and clustering by practice. 
Patterns of change (increase, decrease, no change) were described for each practice.
RESULTS: Among 87 067 children with 118 957 visits before the guideline and 56 814 with 
92 601 visits after the guideline, children had an ADHD diagnosis at 0.7% (95% confidence 
interval [CI], 0.7% to 0.8%) of visits before and 0.9% (95% CI, 0.8% to 0.9%) after guideline 
release and had stimulant prescriptions at 0.4% (95% CI, 0.4% to 0.4%) of visits in both 
periods. A significantly increasing preguideline trend in ADHD diagnosis ended after 
guideline release. The rate of stimulant medication use remained constant before and after 
guideline release. Patterns of change from before to after the guideline varied significantly 
across practices.
CONCLUSIONS: Release of the 2011 guideline that addressed ADHD in preschoolers was 
associated with the end of an increasing rate of diagnosis, and the rate of prescribing 
stimulants remained constant. These are reassuring results given that a standardized 
approach to diagnosis was recommended and stimulant treatment is not first-line therapy 
for this age group.

WHAT’S KNOWN ON THIS SUBJECT: In 2011, the 
American Academy of Pediatrics updated their 
attention-defi
 cit/hyperactivity (ADHD) Clinical 
Practice Guideline to include, for the fi
 rst time, 
recommendations for the diagnosis and treatment of 
preschool-age children, but little is known about the 
impact of this guideline.
WHAT THIS STUDY ADDS: Release of the 2011 
guideline, which standardized ADHD diagnosis and 
treatment of preschool-age children, was associated 
with the end of an increasing trend in preschool 
ADHD diagnosis. The rate of prescribing stimulants to 
preschoolers remained constant.

FIKS et al 
Preschool attention deficit/
hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) is a 
common condition with substantial 
morbidity that is often managed 
in primary care and often treated 
with medication. Parents of >30% 
of preschool-age children seen in 
primary care report behavioral 
concerns. 
1 Such behaviors may 
have meaningful consequences for 
children in this age group, with an 
estimated 6.7 per 1000 expelled 
nationally from preschool or child 
care. 
2 For pediatric clinicians, these 
behaviors may prompt evaluation for 
psychiatric or behavioral disorders, 
especially ADHD, and the initiation of 
psychotropic medication. 
3 In fact, 1 
in 3 children diagnosed with ADHD is 
diagnosed during preschool years, 
 
4 
and 47% of preschoolers diagnosed 
with ADHD are treated with 
medication alone or in combination 
with behavior therapy.5 Reflecting 
the degree of impairment associated 
with ADHD in this group, preschool 
children with ADHD are more likely 
to be in special education programs, 
have unintentional injuries, be 
considered disruptive, and be less 
well-liked than other children. 
6, 
 
7 
In addition, preschool ADHD usually 
persists into later childhood; >60% 
of preschoolers diagnosed with only 
the hyperactive or inattentive and 
>80% of those with combined type 
ADHD will continue to meet criteria 
for ADHD at age 7 years. 
8, 
 
9 As a 
result, decisions about diagnosis and 
treatment in this age group often have 
long-lasting impacts on children.
Still, given the possibility of overlap 
between normal behavior and 
behaviors associated with ADHD 
10 
and the relative lack of trials in this 
age group, pediatricians and the 
public have been concerned about the 
potential for excessive diagnosis and 
medication treatment of preschool-
aged children. Before 2011, no 
American Academy of Pediatrics 
(AAP) guideline existed to help 
pediatricians diagnose or treat ADHD 
among preschoolers. To address these 
concerns and standardize care by using 
the best available medical evidence, 
the AAP in 2011 added guidance on the 
diagnosis and treatment of preschool 
ADHD (children 4 and 5 years of age) to 
their clinical practice guidelines. 
11 This 
standardization of care is important 
given the known variability in ADHD 
management across sites. 
12 
 
 
– 
17 In 
terms of diagnosis, the new guideline 
recommends that “the primary care 
clinician should initiate an evaluation 
for ADHD for any child 4 through 
18 years of age who presents with 
academic or behavioral problems and 
symptoms of inattention, hyperactivity, 
or impulsivity” and cite increased 
evidence that an appropriate diagnosis 
is possible in the preschool-age 
group. 
10 For treatment, the guideline 
specifies, “For preschool-aged children 
(4–5 years of age), the primary care 
clinician should: 1) prescribe evidence-
based parent- and/or teacher-
administered behavior therapy as 
the first line of treatment (quality of 
evidence A/strong recommendation) 
and 2) may prescribe methylphenidate 
if the behavioral interventions do not 
provide significant improvement and 
there is moderate-to-severe continuing 
disturbance in the child’s function.”18
Few data are available on the 
association of guideline release 
with patterns of diagnosis and 
treatment in preschool children with 
ADHD. A 2016 Centers for Disease 
Control and Prevention report 
using administrative data found no 
significant change in medication 
prescribing among preschoolers 
and toddlers covered by employee-
sponsored health insurance before 
compared with after guideline 
release. 
19 However, this report did 
not examine changes at the practice 
level, differences that are especially 
important because practices are the 
microsystems through which care is 
delivered. 
20 The Centers for Disease 
Control and Prevention report also 
primarily considered children age 
2 to 5 years, although the guideline 
specifically issued recommendations 
only for those 4 to 5 years of age. 
To address patterns of diagnosis and 
treatment of children 4 to 5 years 
with varying insurance at a wide 
range of practices, 
 
21 the objective of 
this study was to examine changes 
in rates of ADHD diagnosis and 
stimulant prescribing to children 
aged 48 to 72 months (4 to 5 years) 
old after publication of the 2011 
ADHD practice guideline and to 
examine variability in patterns of 
change across primary care practices.
METHODS
Study Design, Setting, and 
Population
This retrospective cohort study was 
conducted among practices in the 
Comparative Effectiveness Research 
Through Collaborative Electronic 
Reporting (CER2) Consortium. 
21 
CER2 is a “super-network” composed 
of 8 electronic health record 
(EHR)-based research networks, 
including the Electronic Pediatric 
Research in Office Settings (ePROS) 
network of the AAP, 
 
22 the Pediatric 
Research Consortium (PeRC) of the 
Children’s Hospital of Philadelphia, 
the American Academy of Family 
Physicians Electronic National 
Quality Improvement and Research 
Network, the MetroHealth System/
Case Western Reserve School 
of Medicine, the Boston Medical 
Center/Boston Health Net, the Allied 
Physicians Group, and Eskenazi 
Health. The network includes a 
racially, ethnically, and economically 
diverse group of >1.2 million 
children seen by >2000 primary care 
providers at 222 urban, suburban, 
and rural practices and clinics.
In this study, EHR data were 
extracted from 86 primary care 
practices within CER2 ( 
Fig 1). We 
extracted all visits by children 
aged 48 to <72 months attending 
a participating practice between 
January 1, 2008 and June 30, 2014 
(N = 1 803 320 visits). We excluded 
certain years of data from some sites

where EHRs lacked diagnostic or 
prescribing data (N = 96 514 visits 
from 16 practices). To focus on 
visits where all chronic conditions, 
including ADHD and its medication 
treatment, would be expected 
to be reviewed and updated, we 
restricted analysis to preventive 
visits by identifying visits that had 
a preventive health evaluation and 
management code (993nn). Twenty 
practices lacking these billing codes 
were excluded. After exclusions, 
the final study sample included 
211 558 visits from 143 881 children 
at 63 primary care practices. In a 
sensitivity analysis, we expanded 
the definition of a preventive visit to 
include International Classification of 
Diseases, Ninth Revision (ICD-9) code 
V20.2, for well child visits, and found 
similar results.
Outcome Measures
The primary outcomes included 
evidence of an ADHD diagnosis, 
identified by an ICD-9 code of 314.0 
to 314.9, and evidence of a stimulant 
medication prescription, identified by 
Generic Product Identifier, National 
Drug Code, and free text search, 
at each visit. 
14, 
 
23 Stimulants were 
classified as methylphenidate or 
amphetamine compounds.
Guideline Implementation
The exposure of interest in this study 
was implementation of the ADHD 
guideline on October 1, 2011. The 
preguideline period was defined from 
January 1, 2008 to September 30, 2011 
(45 months), and the postguideline 
period was defined from October 1, 
2011 to June 30, 2014 (33 months).
Covariates
Patient-level covariates included 
child gender and age (48–60 months 
or 61–72 months). Race and ethnicity 
were not included in our analysis 
because of high levels of missingness 
(21.4% for race and 13.9% for 
ethnicity) that were highly practice 
dependent, a situation that precluded 
formal imputation. Additional 
covariates included whether the 
child had any comorbidities or 
received any other psychotropic 
medications. A comorbidity was 
defined as having an ADHD diagnosis 
and any of the following ICD-9 codes: 
anxiety (300.00–300.29, 301.4), 
autism or pervasive developmental 
disorder (299.00–299.99), 
bipolar disorder (296.00–296.10, 
296.36–296.89), conduct disorder 
(312.00–312.89), depression (311, 
296.20–296.35), developmental 
delay (315), oppositional defiant 
disorder (313.81), schizophrenia 
(295.00–295.99), and tic disorder 
(307.2–307.29, 333.3). Polypharmacy 
was defined as receiving a stimulant 
and any of the following classes 
of psychotropic medication at the 
same visit: α-agonists (clonidine 
and guanfacine), antidepressants 
(selective serotonin reuptake 
inhibitors, serotonin–norepinephrine 
reuptake inhibitors, tricyclics), 
anxiolytics (benzodiazepines, others), 
mood stabilizers (carbamazepine, 
valproic acid, gabapentin, 
lamotrigine, oxcarbazepine, 
anticonvulsants, lithium), second-
generation antipsychotics 
(risperidone, aripiprazole, others), 
and elective norepinephrine reuptake 
inhibitors (atomoxetine). In a 
sensitivity analysis, we explored the 
role of season and found no seasonal 
pattern in diagnosis or prescribing.
Statistical Analysis
We calculated the proportion of 
visits at which an ADHD diagnosis 
or stimulant prescription was 
received during the preguideline and 
postguideline periods. By using logistic 
regression with a linear spline with a 
knot at the time of guideline release, 
we compared the trajectories of ADHD 
diagnosis and stimulant prescribing 
in the 45 months before and the 33 
months after guideline release. 
A separate model estimated the log 
odds of stimulant prescription among 
those diagnosed with ADHD. All models 
adjusted for patient age and used 
robust variance estimates to account 
for clustering by primary care practice.
Next, we examined variation between 
primary care practices in diagnosis

and prescribing by using descriptive 
statistics (median, range, interquartile 
range). We then described practice-
level change from before to after 
guideline implementation in both 
diagnosis and prescribing by 
calculating the proportion of practices 
with each of the following patterns: 
increase, no change, or decrease (by 
≥0.1 percentage points). We tested 
whether the change from before to 
after the guideline varied significantly 
across practices by adding an 
interaction between practice and time 
to the models described above.
All analyses were conducted in Stata 
version 13.1 (Stata Corp, College 
Station, TX). This study was approved 
by the AAP Institutional Review 
Board. The Children’s Hospital of 
Philadelphia Institutional Review 
Board considered this study “not 
human subjects research.”
RESULTS
Overall Demographics and Clinical 
Characteristics
A total of 211 558 primary care visits 
by 143 881 preschool-age children 
at 63 practices were included. The 
preguideline period included 118 957 
visits among 87 067 children, whereas 
the postguideline period included 
92 601 visits among 56 814 children. 
The gender distribution of the 
population remained constant over 
time, but the postguideline period 
had a higher percentage of visits with 
children aged 48 to 60 months (83% 
vs 71% in the preguideline period) 
and a lower proportion of visits with 
white (42% vs 48%) and Hispanic 
(10% vs 14%) children ( 
Table 1).
Characteristics of Children With 
ADHD Diagnoses or Treated With 
Stimulant Medication
Children had an ADHD diagnosis at 
0.7% of visits in the preguideline 
period and 0.9% in the postguideline 
period. The rate of stimulant 
prescribing was stable across periods 
(0.4%), as were rates of comorbid 
diagnoses and polypharmacy ( 
Table 1). 
The demographic characteristics of 
children with a visit with an ADHD 
diagnosis or stimulant prescription 
are described in  
Table 2. ADHD 
diagnoses and stimulant prescriptions 
were more common in male than 
female children and in children aged 
61 to 72 months compared with 48 
to 60 months. Children with ADHD 
had a comorbid diagnosis at 25% 
(before guideline) and 27% (after 
guideline) of visits, most commonly 
developmental delay (14% in both 
periods), autism (6% before, 5% 
after), oppositional defiant disorder 
(3%, 6%) and conduct disorder 
(3% in both periods). Analyses of 
medication use revealed that the 
preschool-age children in the sample 
who were on stimulants received

another psychotropic medication at 
27% of visits in both periods. At visits 
by these children, the most prevalent 
medications used in combination 
with stimulants were α-agonists 
(22%, 21%), second-generation 
antipsychotics (5% in both periods), 
and antidepressants (2%, 3%).
Patterns of ADHD Diagnosis and 
Stimulant Medication Use Before 
and After Guideline Release
In the preguideline period, the 
trajectory of ADHD diagnosis increased 
slightly but significantly across 
practices ( 
Fig 2, P = .01). However, 
the rate of ADHD diagnosis no longer 
increased significantly after guideline 
release (postguideline slope P = .6, 
indicating no difference from 0; change 
in slope from before to after guideline 
P = .4, indicating that change from 
before to after guideline was not 
significant). Levels of stimulant 
medication prescribing remained 
stable over time (preguideline slope 
P = .5, indicating no difference from 
0; postguideline slope P = .9; change 
in slope P = .8, indicating no change 
in patterns of stimulant prescribing 
before versus after guideline release). 
Of note, the proportion of children 
with an ADHD diagnosis who received 
stimulants decreased significantly 
before guideline release (P < .001). 
After release, the proportion of children 
with an ADHD diagnosis who received 
stimulants did not change significantly 
over time (postguideline slope: P = .7).
Practice Variation
 
Table 3 displays the median and 
range of ADHD diagnosis and 
stimulant prescribing at the primary 
care practice level before and after 
guideline release and highlights 
variability across sites. In addition 
to variability in rates of diagnosis 
and prescribing, we found that the 
change in the proportion of visits 
with an ADHD diagnosis or stimulant 
prescription from before to after 
guideline release varied significantly 
across practices (P < .001 for both; 
 
Table 4). The rate of diagnosis 
increased in 41% of practices, did 
not change in 19% of practices, and 
decreased in 24% of practices after 
release of the guideline. The rates 
of stimulant prescribing increased 
for 22% of practices, did not change 
for 21%, and decreased for 41% 
of practices. Ten practices (16%) 
had 0 eligible visits in 1 of the time 
periods, so change could not be 
assessed. These changes did not vary 
by urban, suburban, or rural practice 
setting, region of the United States, or 
network affiliation of practices.
DISCUSSION
We investigated the impact of the 
2011 AAP ADHD Clinical Practice 
Guideline on diagnosis and treatment 
among children 4 to 5 years of age. 
Although patterns at individual 
practices varied, overall results 
revealed that the diagnosis of 
ADHD in this age group was 
increasing before, but not after, the 
guideline release. Even so, rates of 
stimulant medication prescription 
remained stable throughout the 
study period. As a consequence of 
these patterns, before the guideline 
release but not after, children seen 
at included primary care sites were 
becoming less likely over time to 
receive stimulant medication if 
diagnosed.

A primary goal of clinical practice 
guidelines is to standardize care. 
24 
In the case of preschool ADHD, 
such standardization might have 
resulted in an increasing trajectory 
in diagnosis of preschool children 
if pediatric clinicians had not 
previously been evaluating ADHD 
when an evaluation was warranted. 
Alternatively, a decrease in diagnosis 
could have occurred if clinicians were 
applying more rigorous standards to 
the diagnosis and therefore excluding 
certain children who might have 
previously been diagnosed or no 
change if a combination of these 2 
patterns was occurring or if there 
was no change in the standard used. 
Our overall results indicate that the 
release of the 2011 guideline was 
associated with a stabilization of the 
rate of diagnosis among children 
4 to 5 years old. Although 0.7% 
of children at visits in our sample 
before the guideline release had 
ADHD compared with 0.9% after, 
the increasing trend in diagnosis 
before guideline release ended in the 
postguideline period. These rates of 
preschool ADHD are lower than those 
found in the epidemiologic surveys 
of community samples that report 
between 2% and 4% of preschool 
children affected 
25, 
 
26 but, as expected, 
higher than rates found among 
2- to 5-year-olds using claim data 
(0.5%–0.6%). 
19 Although a detailed 
chart review study of the diagnostic 
process used by individual clinicians 
was beyond the scope of this study 
and would be needed to definitively 
confirm the mechanism behind 
the pattern observed, our findings 
indicate that the standardization 
provided by the guideline did not 
trigger increases in diagnosis.
Unlike for diagnosis, rates of stimulant 
medication prescribing were stable 
across study periods. An examination 
of these rates is particularly important 
because behavior therapy, not 
stimulant medication treatment, 
is first-line management for ADHD 
in this age group, and previous 
investigations have found that nearly 
80% of preschool children with ADHD 
received medication, compared with 
only slightly more than half receiving 
behavior therapy. 
19 In addition, 
access to behavior therapy among 
all children may be limited by a

lack of providers offering evidence-
based treatments. 
27 In our study, 
before the 2011 guideline release 
and driven largely by the increase in 
diagnosis, the likelihood of receiving 
medication given a diagnosis of ADHD 
significantly decreased but was stable 
after guideline release. This pattern 
of decreasing medication use given 
a diagnosis of ADHD over time may 
have been driven by the Preschool 
ADHD Treatment Study, published in 
2006, which found that the effect size 
of stimulant treatment in preschool-
aged children is lower than in school-
aged children. 
18, 
 
28 
– 
31 Alternatively, 
findings may have resulted from a 
decrease in the severity of preschool 
children diagnosed with ADHD as 
the proportion of all preschoolers 
diagnosed with ADHD increased.
Practice variability is common in 
pediatrics 
14, 
 
32 
– 
34 and has triggered 
calls for standardization and the local 
implementation of clinical practice 
guidelines. Previously, we found 
widespread variation in mental health 
diagnosis and prescribing across 
pediatric primary care sites. For 
example, rates of ADHD diagnosis 
and stimulant prescribing ranged 
from 1% to 16% and 3% to 18%, 
respectively.14 Because guidelines 
standardize care, we expected to 
see decreased variation across sites 
after guideline release. However, we 
found varying responses of sites to the 
guideline, and the interquartile range 
across practices for both diagnosis 
and stimulant prescribing did not 
narrow. These findings indicate that 
although the overall results of our 
study are reassuring, practices may be 
responding differently to the guideline 
both for diagnosis and prescribing, 
and standardization of ADHD practice 
may be difficult to achieve. Additional 
investigation is needed to understand 
whether these patterns reflect local 
changes in the population under 
care, varying demand for evaluation 
of preschool ADHD, or known 
differences in how clinicians respond 
to guidelines. 
35
More broadly, this study demonstrates 
the utility of EHR data from across 
settings in monitoring changes in 
practice associated with the release of 
clinical practice guidelines. Although 
many barriers to guideline adherence 
have been described, 
 
35 the systematic 
measurement of practice change 
could provide an opportunity to 
assess in what circumstances and 
contexts guidelines demonstrate the 
greatest impact, where there might 
be unintended consequences, and 
when additional practice supports are 
needed to better achieve guideline-
based care. In addition, because EHR 
data are available as soon as care is 
delivered, such assessment could be 
possible without the delays involved 
in the release of claim data. With 
the growing emphasis on quality 
improvement, practice improvement 
modules could then be designed 
to address identified barriers and 
improve the implementation of 
guideline-based care.
This study had several limitations. 
First, although our analyses accounted 
for trajectories in diagnosis and 
prescribing over time, this design 
cannot assess causality. Second, 
even though primary care practices 
typically reconcile diagnoses and 
medications from outside providers, 
medications and diagnoses from 
psychiatrists or other mental health 
providers may have been missed if 
primary care clinicians were unaware 
of them or did not document them. 
However, our analyses focused on 
preventive visits where review and 
updating of records were most likely 
to occur. Third, medication analyses 
were based on prescribing in the 
EHR. We lacked data on actual use by 
children. In addition, the EHRs used 
in the study did not have data on 
whether children received behavior 
therapy, the first-line treatment in this 
age group. Fourth, although our data 
included both Medicaid and privately 
insured children and children from 
different racial backgrounds, we 
lacked data on insurance type for 
the majority of practices. Finally, our 
data did not include information on 
whether diagnoses or prescriptions 
were originally made through primary 
care or in other settings.
CONCLUSIONS
Release of the 2011 guideline that 
addressed ADHD in preschoolers for 
the first time was associated with the 
end of a significantly increasing rate 
of diagnosis. There was no change 
in the overall rate of prescribing 
stimulants to preschool-aged 
children. These are reassuring results 
given that a standardized approach 
to diagnosis was recommended 
and stimulant treatment is not 
recommended as first-line therapy 
for this age group. More broadly, this 
study demonstrates the feasibility, 
at least in certain clinical contexts, of 
using EHR data from across varied 
pediatric practices to measure 
practice change associated with 
guideline release, a model likely to 
become increasingly important in 
driving quality improvement efforts.
