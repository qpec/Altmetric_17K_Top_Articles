Subclinical magnesium deficiency: 
a principal driver of cardiovascular 
disease and a public health crisis

AbstrAct
Because serum magnesium does not reflect intracellular 
magnesium, the latter making up more than 99% of total 
body magnesium, most cases of magnesium deficiency 
are undiagnosed. Furthermore, because of chronic 
diseases, medications, decreases in food crop magnesium 
contents, and the availability of refined and processed 
foods, the vast majority of people in modern societies are 
at risk for magnesium deficiency. Certain individuals will 
need to supplement with magnesium in order to prevent 
suboptimal magnesium deficiency, especially if trying to 
obtain an optimal magnesium status to prevent chronic 
disease. Subclinical magnesium deficiency increases 
the risk of numerous types of cardiovascular disease, 
costs nations around the world an incalculable amount of 
healthcare costs and suffering, and should be considered 
a public health crisis. That an easy, cost-effective strategy 
exists to prevent and treat subclinical magnesium 
deficiency should provide an urgent call to action.
MagnesiuM in huMan biology
‘Magnesium is the seventh most abun-
dant element in the Earth’s crust by mass 
or molarity…In vertebrates, magnesium is 
extremely abundant and it is the second most 
common intracellular cation (potassium 
being the first). Extracellular magnesium 
accounts for only ∼1% of total body magne-
sium, which is found primarily in serum and 
red blood cells’.1 
Magnesium is the fourth most common 
cation in our body, the second most common 
intracellular cation and the most common 
intracellular divalent cation.2 The human 
body contains around 25 g of magnesium.3 
Magnesium is necessary for the functioning 
of over 300 enzymes in human,4 with 90% 
of total body magnesium being contained 
in the muscles and bones (~27% and ~63%, 
respectively), 90% of which is bound and with 
only 10% being free.5 In the serum, 32% of 
magnesium is bound to albumin, whereas 
55% is free.5
Some of the main functions of magnesium 
in human biology include the maintenance 
of ionic gradients (keeping intracellular 
sodium and calcium low and potassium high), 
cellular and tissue integrity, mitochondrial 
oxidative phosphorylation (ATP production 
and activation), and DNA, RNA and protein 
synthesis and integrity.3 6
The elimination of magnesium is mainly 
controlled by the kidneys, increasing in the 
urine when there is magnesium surplus and 
falling to just 1 mEq of magnesium (~12 mg) 
during deficits.3 However, despite renal 
conservation, magnesium can be pulled from 
the bone (as well as muscles and internal 
organs) in order to maintain normal serum 
magnesium levels when intakes are low.7 8 
Thus, a normal serum magnesium level does 
not rule out magnesium deficiency, which 
predisposes to osteopaenia, osteoporosis and 
fractures.
An excess of heavy metals due to soil 
contamination and a lack of minerals due 
to soil erosion also may predispose to micro-
nutrient deficits.9 The importance of the 
mineral content of soil and water, once 
greatly appreciated, think low iodine levels in 
soil and the increased prevalence of goitre, 
has all but been forgotten.10 Furthermore, 
refined foods are depleted of magnesium 
during their processing.11 In order to prevent 
chronic diseases, we need to change our 
mindset away from exclusively treating acute 
illness and instead focus more on treating the 
underlying causes of chronic diseases, such as 
magnesium deficiency.
There are two types of nutrient deficien-
cies, frank deficiencies (such as scurvy from 
ascorbic acid deficiency or goitre from iodine 
deficiency) and subclinical deficiencies (a 
clinically silent reduction in physiological, 
cellular and/or biochemical functions). It is 
the latter that is most concerning as it is hard 
to diagnose and predisposes to numerous 
chronic diseases. And while both result in 
negative health consequences, the former has 
obvious symptoms (hence frank deficiency), 
whereas the latter may have negative or vari-
able health effects that are not so apparent 
(eg, vascular calcification). The evidence

in the literature suggests that subclinical magnesium 
deficiency is rampant and one of the leading causes of 
chronic diseases including cardiovascular disease and 
early mortality around the globe, and should be consid-
ered a public health crisis.12–14
MagnesiuM intake
‘The homeostatic mechanisms to regulate magnesium 
balance were developed millions of years ago. Investiga-
tions of the macro- and micro-nutrient supply in Paleo-
lithic nutrition of the former hunter/gatherer societies 
showed a magnesium uptake with the usual diet of about 
600 mg magnesium/day, much higher than today’. Our 
homeostatic mechanisms and genome are still the same 
as with our ancestors in the Stone Age. This means our 
metabolism is best adapted to a high magnesium intake.5
In developed countries, the average intake of magne-
sium is slightly over 4 mg/kg/day.15 More than a quarter 
of obese and non-obese youth have inadequate intakes of 
magnesium (27% and 29%, respectively). The authors of 
a study concluded: ‘Even though children may consume 
an excess of energy, they may not be meeting all of their 
micronutrient needs’.16 In other words, children are 
overfed and undernourished. One expert has argued that 
a typical Western diet may provide enough magnesium 
to avoid frank magnesium deficiency, but it is unlikely 
to maintain high-normal magnesium levels and provide 
optimal risk reduction from coronary artery disease and 
osteoporosis. That is, ‘Various studies have shown that at 
least 300 mg magnesium must be supplemented to estab-
lish significantly increased serum magnesium concentra-
tions…’5 In other words, most people need an additional 
300 mg of magnesium per day in order to lower their 
risk of developing numerous chronic diseases. So while 
the recommended daily allowance (RDA) for magne-
sium (between 300 and 420 mg/day for most people) 
may prevent frank magnesium deficiency, it is unlikely to 
provide optimal health and longevity, which should be 
the ultimate goal.
Importantly, much of the population may not even 
be meeting the RDA for magnesium. For example, the 
average magnesium intake in men and women in Taiwan 
is only 250 mg and 216 mg, respectively, or 68%–70% of 
the recommended dietary reference intake.17 The authors 
of the study concluded: ‘Taiwanese elderly persons had 
suboptimal levels of dietary magnesium intake, which 
although may be sufficient to avoid overt magnesium 
deficiency, may not be sufficient to reduce the risk of 
diabetes in the elderly’.17 The National Nutrition Survey 
in Japan found that for people 15–49 years old the intake 
of magnesium was below the Japanese RDA.18 Moreover, 
around half (48%) of the US population consumes less 
than the recommended amount of magnesium from 
food.19 The US Department of Agriculture states that the 
average magnesium intake in women and men is 228 mg/
day and 323 mg/day, respectively. Based on these data, 
one group of authors noted: ‘These intake levels suggest 
that a substantial number of people may be at risk for 
Mg deficiency, especially if concomitant disorders and/
or medications place the individual at further risk for Mg 
depletion’.7 The most recent published review on magne-
sium concluded: ‘Approximately 50% of Americans 
consume less than the Estimated Average Requirement 
(EAR) for magnesium, and some age groups consume 
substantially less’.20
Lakshmanan et al collected daily food records for 1 year 
in 34 men and women. They found that the mean magne-
sium intake was 323 mg/day and 234 mg/day in men and 
women, respectively (around 4 mg/kg/day). Despite this 
level of intake, the overall patient population was in nega-
tive magnesium balance (−32 and −25 mg/day, respec-
tively).21 Moreover, 75% of women consumed less than 
the RDA (300 mg/day) and only one out of the eighteen 
women were in equilibrium. Considering that the average 
intake of magnesium in the USA is around 228 mg/day in 
women and 266 mg/day in men,12 a large percentage of 
Americans may be at risk of negative magnesium balance. 
Indeed, ‘Only American diets containing more than 3000 
kcal/day may provide 300 mg or more magnesium’.21 
Another long-term study lasting 50 weeks found that 
somewhere between 180 mg and 320 mg of magnesium/
day is required in order to maintain positive magnesium 
balance.22 And since many individuals may be consuming 
below 320 mg/day of magnesium, this poses a major 
public health threat.
The data are consistent around the world that magne-
sium intake may be inadequate. Indeed, the intake of 
magnesium in Germany was determined to be only 
200 mg for women and 250 mg for men.5 23 In Kiev a study 
on 780 men aged 20–59 found that the overall popula-
tion consumed insufficient magnesium from food rations 
(10% less than the recommended value). The authors 
also found a correlation between the low magnesium 
consumption in food and the prevalence of risk factors for 
ischaemic heart disease, such as hyperlipoproteinaemia, 
arterial hypertension and body weight.24 In 2004, Durlach 
concluded: ‘About 20% of the population consumes less 
than two-thirds of the RDA for Mg. Women, particularly, 
have low intakes. For example, in France, 23% of women 
and 18% of men have inadequate intakes. Mg deficiency 
during pregnancy can induce maternal, fetal, and pedi-
atric consequences that might last throughout life’.25 The 
median magnesium intake in an elderly population (832 
subjects aged 70 years or older) in Southern France was 
also found to be below the RDA.26 Another French study 
on 2373 subjects (4–82 years of age) noted that 71.7% 
of men and 82.5% of women had an inadequate magne-
sium intake.27

‘Hypomagnesemia is a relatively common occurrence 
in clinical medicine. That it often goes unrecognized 
is due to the fact that magnesium levels are rarely eval-
uated since few clinicians are aware of the many clinical

states in which deficiency, or excess, of this ion may 
occur’.28
In developed countries, older data estimated that the 
prevalence of marginal magnesium deficit is 15%–20% 
of the population.15 This corroborates more recent data 
indicating that around 10%–30% of a given population 
has subclinical magnesium deficiency based on serum 
magnesium levels <0.80 mmol/L.29 The 2006 National 
Health and Nutrition Survey found low serum concen-
trations of magnesium in 36.3% and 31% of female and 
male Mexican adults, respectively.30 The authors of the 
study concluded: ‘Low serum concentrations of…magne-
sium are published for the first time and show signifi-
cant prevalence of deficiencies’,30 and up to 20% of the 
general population has low serum magnesium levels.31 
A systematic review of 37 articles discovered that magne-
sium deficiency was a possible public health concern for 
older adults.32
Magnesium deficiency has been found in 84% of post-
menopausal women with osteoporosis diagnosed by 
low magnesium trabecular bone content and Thoren’s 
magnesium load test.33 Among apparently healthy 
university students in Brazil, 42% were found to have 
subnormal magnesium status (based on plasma or eryth-
rocyte magnesium levels).13 The average magnesium 
intake was only around 215 mg/day. Magnesium deple-
tion has been found in 75% and 30.8% of patients with 
poorly controlled type 2 diabetes based on serum and 
intracellular magnesium status, respectively.34
Magnesium deficiency can be present despite normal 
serum magnesium levels.6 Approximately 20% of 381 
unselected elderly men and women (most of them in 
their 80s) were found to have low erythrocyte potas-
sium and magnesium levels. The authors of the study 
concluded: ‘This study underlines the large prevalence of 
magnesium and potassium deficiencies in the elderly’.35 
Another study concluded: ‘The commonly designated 
low limit of the normal range…is below levels that exist 
in patients with marginal deficiencies that can predispose 
to development of pathologic findings, so that the prev-
alence and importance of this disease is insufficiently 
considered…It is a statistical error to use the confidence 
limits of the normal population as the exclusion limit for 
those with abnormal Mg status’.36 In other words, our 
normal range of serum magnesium is inaccurate and that 
serum magnesium levels at the lower end of normal likely 
suggest marginal magnesium deficiency.29 Indeed, ‘The 
magnesium content of the plasma is an unreliable guide 
to body stores: muscle is a more accurate guide to the 
body content of this intracellular cation’.37
Another study highlighting the discrepancy between 
serum and body magnesium levels concluded: ‘Although 
serum-K and serum-Mg values in patients receiving 
long-term treatment for hypertension or incompen-
sated heart disease usually are normal, muscle-Mg and 
muscle-K contents are reduced in around 50% of these 
patients…Evaluation of the K and Mg status during 
diuretic treatment should be preferentially based on 
tissue determinations. The muscle biopsy method is 
rapid, reliable and may reveal conditions of deficiency…
oral supplements of Mg have proved to be adequate to 
restore the normal K/Mg status’.38
Among critically ill postoperative patients, 36.5% were 
found to have magnesium deficiency based on ionised 
magnesium levels in red blood cells.39 In one study of 
patients from a medical intensive care unit (ICU), 65% 
had hypomagnesaemia. The author concluded: ‘The 
prevalence of normomagnesemic Mg deficiency in crit-
ically ill patients may be even higher (than 65%, my 
insertion) and may contribute to the pathogenesis of 
hypocalcemia, cardiac arrhythmias and other symptoms 
of Mg deficiency’.40 Finally, 6.9%–11% of hospitalised 
patients have been noted to have hypomagnesaemia on 
routine exam posing on unrecognised need.41
The overall incidence of hypomagnesaemia in one 
study was noted to be between 5% and 8% of the overall 
population, and in young women (aged 18–22) the inci-
dence was approximately 20%.5 One of the largest studies, 
a cross-sectional study in an unselected population of 
more than 16 000 subjects in Germany, found a preva-
lence of hypomagnesaemia (magnesium levels below 
0.76 mmol/L) of 14.5%.5 42 Over 15% of hospitalised 
elderly patients have been found with low serum magne-
sium levels.43 Another study noted: ‘At ICU admission 
52.5% had total hypomagnesemia and 13.5% total hyper-
magnesemia; with respect to the Mg(2+) 9.7% showed 
ionized hypomagnesemia and 23.6% ionized hyperma-
gnesemia. Patients who developed ionized hyperma-
gnesemia had higher mortality than patients without 
ionized hypermagnesemia development (P=0.04)’.44 
And it has been noted that ‘Hypomagnesemia detected 
at the time of admission of acutely ill medical patients 
is associated with an increased mortality rate for both 
ward and medical ICU patients’.45 Magnesium depletion 
is present in about half of all ICU patients.46 More than 
50% of those hospitalised with either of the following 
conditions are likely to be magnesium-deficient based on 
an intravenous retention >20%: hypertension, coronary 
artery disease, cerebrovascular event, gastrointestinal 
issues or alcoholism.47
Based on 183 peer-reviewed studies published from 
1990 to 2008, one group of authors concluded: ‘The 
perception that ‘normal’ serum magnesium excludes 
deficiency is common among clinicians. This perception 
is probably enforced by the common laboratory practice 
of highlighting only abnormal results. A health warning 
is therefore warranted regarding potential misuse of 
‘normal’ serum magnesium because restoration of 
magnesium stores in deficient patients is simple, toler-
able, inexpensive and can be clinically beneficial’.48
One study found that 10 out of 11 apparently healthy 
women were magnesium-deficient based on the oral 
magnesium load test. The authors concluded: ‘The 
results showed there are more frequent deficiencies of 
magnesium in organisms than it is generally assumed’.49 
Another study showed that 37.6% of patients with type

2 diabetes and 10.9% of age-matched and sex-matched 
healthy controls have low plasma magnesium levels.50
Of patients with severe chronic airway obstruc-
tion, 11.6% have serum magnesium levels less than the 
lower normal limit. The authors of the study concluded: 
‘…routine serum magnesium determination is recom-
mended in patients with chronic obstructive lung disease 
taking diuretic drugs or corticosteroids’.51
Hypomagnesaemia was identified in 47% of 1033 
samples based on both routine magnesium determina-
tions as well as physician-initiated requests for magne-
sium measurements.52 Importantly, only 10% of the 
hypomagnesaemia findings were found by physician- 
initiated requests, underscoring the fact that low magne-
sium blood levels are an overlooked issue by medical 
doctors.
About 80% of patients with hypertension treated for at 
least 6 months with either hydrochlorothiazide or a single 
non-diuretic drug have been found to have magnesium 
depletion based on retention of a parenterally adminis-
tered magnesium load.53 More troubling is that despite 
being magnesium-depleted, patients treated with hydro-
chlorothiazide had high normal serum magnesium. This 
study underlines how patients can have normal or even 
higher magnesium levels in the blood despite magne-
sium depletion. Another study confirmed these findings 
that ‘thiazides induce a magnesium depletion not detect-
able by monitoring serum levels’.54 There is a correla-
tion between low magnesium bone concentrations and 
increased magnesium retention after an intravenous 
magnesium load, suggesting that magnesium is retained 
in the bone after the test.55
After several weeks of strenuous physical activity, serum 
magnesium can increase with no change in erythrocyte 
magnesium levels despite a reduction in mononuclear 
cell magnesium levels. The authors of a study concluded 
that the reduction in mononuclear cell magnesium 
content ‘reflects a reduction in exchangeable magnesium 
body stores, and the onset of a magnesium deficiency 
state’.56 This study also indicates that just 6–12 weeks of 
strenuous physical activity can lead to magnesium defi-
ciency. Another study concluded: ‘Serum and urinary 
magnesium concentrations decrease during endurance 
running, consistent with the possibility of magnesium 
deficiency. This may be related to increased demand in 
skeletal muscle’.57
One study found low levels of erythrocyte magnesium 
in 119 of 179 (66%) patients admitted consecutively to 
the ICU.58 The prevalence of hypomagnesaemia at ICU 
admission has been estimated at around 51.3%, with a 
prevalence of ionised hypomagnesaemia at ICU admis-
sion ranging between 14.4% and 22%.44
While a normal serum magnesium is considered to be 
0.7–1 mmol/L, the optimal serum magnesium concentra-
tion has been proposed to be >0.80 mmol/L.59 Chronic 
latent magnesium deficiency has been defined as ‘…a 
serum magnesium concentration of between 0.75 and 
0.849 mmol/L (within the reference interval), with a 
positive magnesium load test indicating magnesium 
deficiency’.14
in summary
‘Abnormalities of serum Mg may be the most underdiag-
nosed serum electrolyte abnormality in clinical practice 
today. The incidence appears to range from 12.5% to 
20% on routine determination’.41
‘norMal’ seruM MagnesiuM levels
0.75–0.95 mmol/l29
 
► A serum magnesium <0.82 mmol/L (2.0 mg/dL) with 
a 24-hour urinary magnesium excretion of 40–80 mg/
day is highly suggestive of magnesium deficiency.29
 
► One group of experts has recommended magnesium 
supplementation in subjects experiencing symptoms 
that reflect magnesium deficiency if the serum level is 
below 0.9 mmol/L,36 with levels less than 0.8 mmol/L 
necessitating magnesium.
 
► Serum magnesium levels above 0.95 mmol/L may in-
dicate hypermagnesaemia.
dietary faCtors affeCting MagnesiuM status
‘Although magnesium intakes have been gradually falling 
since the beginning of the century, there were sharply 
increased intakes of nutrients that increased its require-
ments [particularly high vitamin D and phosphorus 
intakes]…The major source of phosphorus derives from 
soft drinks that contain phosphoric acid, the consump-
tion of which has been rising markedly in the last quarter 
of a century’.60
Since 1940 there has been a tremendous decline in the 
micronutrient density of foods. In the UK for example, 
there has been loss of magnesium in beef (−4 to −8%), 
bacon (−18%), chicken (−4%), cheddar cheese (−38%), 
parmesan cheese (−70%), whole milk (−21%) and vege-
tables (−24%).61 The loss of magnesium during food 
refining/processing is significant: white flour (−82%), 
polished rice (−83%), starch (−97%) and white sugar 
(−99%).12 Since 1968 the magnesium content in wheat 
has dropped almost 20%, which may be due to acidic 
soil, yield dilution and unbalanced crop fertilisation 
(high levels of nitrogen, phosphorus and potassium, the 
latter of which antagonises the absorption of magnesium 
in plants).62 One review paper concluded: ‘Magnesium 
deficiency in plants is becoming an increasingly severe 
problem with the development of industry and agricul-
ture and the increase in human population’.62 Processed 
foods, fat, refined flour and sugars are all devoid of 
magnesium, and thus our Western diet predisposes us to 
magnesium deficiency. Good dietary sources of magne-
sium include nuts, dark chocolate and unrefined whole 
grains.
Increased calcium and phosphorus intake also increases 
magnesium requirements and may worsen or precipitate 
magnesium deficiency.63–65 Dairy, especially cheese, has 
a very high phosphorus to magnesium (Mg) ratio. For

example, cheddar cheese has a phosphorus:magnesium 
ratio of ~18 and a calcium:magnesium ratio of ~26,66 
whereas pumpkin seeds have a phosphorus:magnesium 
ratio of 0.35 and a calcium:magnesium ratio of 0.21.67 
Some have argued that the optimal dietary calcium:mag-
nesium ratio is close to 2:1.15
The amount of dietary magnesium required to main-
tain positive balance depends on numerous factors 
including the patient population as well as dietary and 
lifestyle choices. Indeed, magnesium balance decreases 
when calcium intake is over 10 mg/kg/day.21 Thus, the 
minimum required magnesium intake to maintain posi-
tive balance is not universal. Indeed, ‘Magnesium, like 
other dietary components, interacts with several nutrients 
and its requirement is modified not only by their levels 
but also by their form or type. The American diet is low 
in calcium and fiber as well as in magnesium, and high in 
protein and phosphorus’.21 Excess calcium, phosphorus 
and vitamin D may also lead to increased magnesium loss 
increasing magnesium requirements.60
The phosphate to calcium ratio in the USA during 
1932–1939 was approximately 1.2:1, rising to 4:1 in those 
who substituted the intake of soda for milk, but other 
data suggest that the phosphate:calcium ratio is around 
1.5:1.60 Nonetheless, the most dramatic change that has 
occurred since the early 1900s until now regarding phos-
phate, calcium and magnesium has been a reduction 
in magnesium intake, going from around 500 mg/day 
to an average of 250 mg/day. Thus, the calcium:magne-
sium ratio has increased from approximately 2:1 to 5:1, 
and the phosphate:magnesium ratio has increased from 
1.2:1 to around 7:1.60 The increase in dietary phosphate 
has come from phosphate additives, found in many food 
items but especially processed meats, as well as from 
phosphoric acid found in soft drinks.
One group of authors concluded: ‘The prevalence 
and incidence of type 2 diabetes in the United States 
increased sharply between 1994 and 2001 as the ratio 
of calcium-to-magnesium intake from food rose from 
<3.0 to >3.0’.19 Another group of authors noted a 3.25-
fold increased risk of diabetes at plasma magnesium 
levels <0.863 mmol/L (despite 0.75 mmol/L being consid-
ered a ‘normal’ level).17 In other words, patients with 
diabetes appear to be magnesium-deficient and magne-
sium deficiency likely increases the risk of diabetes.
Dietary aluminium may lead to magnesium deficit 
by reducing the absorption of magnesium by approxi-
mately fivefold, reducing magnesium retention by 41% 
and causing a reduction of magnesium in the bone.68 
And since aluminium is widely prevalent in modern-day 
society (such as in aluminium cookware, deodorants, 
over-the-counter and prescription medications, baking 
powder, baked goods, and others), this could be a major 
contributor to magnesium deficiency. In fact, an area 
near a Skawina aluminium plant in Poland was found to 
have a lower percentage of people with normal magne-
sium levels in red blood cells and urine compared with 
those in Chorzów.69
A common misconception is that consuming phytate-
rich foods can lead to nutrient deficiencies particu-
larly magnesium depletion via binding by phytic acid. 
However, urinary magnesium excretion will drop to 
compensate for a reduction in bioavailable magnesium.70 
And most high-phytate foods are also good sources of 
magnesium (grains and beans are good examples). Thus, 
it is unlikely that consuming foods high in phytate will 
lead to magnesium depletion. However, a vitamin B6-de-
ficient diet can lead to a negative magnesium balance via 
increased magnesium excretion.71
MagnesiuM balanCe
A study of 11 postmenopausal women (aged 49–71 
years) found that an intake of 107 mg/day of magne-
sium was inadequate for maintaining positive magnesium 
balance.72 A placebo-controlled trial in young women 
who were supplemented with 100 mg magnesium per 
day (basal magnesium intake 250 mg) was inadequate for 
positive or even zero magnesium balance even though 
the supplemented women had a higher magnesium 
excretion in urine, indicating a higher total absorption.5 
In other words, young women may be in negative magne-
sium balance despite consuming 350 mg of magnesium 
per day. However, one double-blind metabolic balance 
study in postmenopausal Caucasian women showed that 
318 mg of magnesium per day was enough to remain in 
positive balance, but 118 mg/day was inadequate.73 A 
more recent balance study in postmenopausal women 
found that while a diet containing 399 mg of magnesium 
per 2000 kcal was able to produce a positive magne-
sium balance, a diet containing ~100 mg of magnesium 
per 2000 kcal was inadequate.74 Other data have found 
negative magnesium balance in men with osteoporosis or 
psychoneurosis consuming 240 mg/day of magnesium.75 
Another study noted negative magnesium balance 
(−122 mg) in those consuming 322 mg/day of magne-
sium on top of a high-fibre diet.76 In other words, context 
matters (overall dietary pattern, patient population and 
background medication).
One of the most comprehensive reviews in the litera-
ture on this subject suggests that in healthy adults only 
around 180 mg of magnesium per day is required to 
maintain balance in healthy individuals (even when 
taking into account magnesium sweat losses). This anal-
ysis pooled magnesium data from 27 different tightly 
controlled balance studies (lasting more than 27 days) 
conducted in the USA.77 However, it must be noted that 
this analysis does not take into account the numerous 
disease states, medications, stress and dietary factors that 
increase magnesium requirements.
Based on the National Health and Nutrition Examina-
tion Survey (NHANES) data, 64% of women aged 51–70 
years old do not achieve the EAR for this age group 
(265 mg/day),77 with an estimated average magnesium 
intake of just 246 mg/day (NHANES 2001–2002) and 
only 238 mg/day (NHANES 1999–2000). Magnesium

intake for Mexican and African–American women of the 
same age group is even lower (185 mg/day and 169 mg/
day, respectively, and 176 mg/day and 150 mg/day in 
those reporting no dietary supplement use).77 Thus, 
the elderly population is especially at risk of magnesium 
deficiency due to low intake but also increased risk for 
chronic diseases that predispose to magnesium defi-
ciency (ageing also reduces magnesium absorption from 
the diet, ie, achlorhydria). Table 1 covers the magnesium 
requirements from older balance studies.
Causes of MagnesiuM defiCienCy
Numerous factors can lead to magnesium deficiency, 
such as kidney failure,78 alcohol consumption79 and 
malabsorption issues (magnesium is absorbed in the 
small intestine and in the colon3; thus, patients with 
intestinal or colon damage such as Crohn’s disease, irri-
table bowel syndrome, coeliac disease, gastroenteritis, 
idiopathic steatorrhoea, ulcerative colitis, resection of 
the small intestine, ileostomy patients or patients with 
ulcerative colitis may have magnesium deficiency). Renal 
tubular acidosis, diabetic acidosis, prolonged diuresis, 
acute pancreatitis, hyperparathyroidism and primary 
aldosteronism can also lead to magnesium deficiency.80 A 
meta-analysis of 13 studies in almost 5500 patients found 
that magnesium levels were significantly lower in patients 
with metabolic syndrome versus controls.81 The intrave-
nous magnesium tolerance test has confirmed that chil-
dren with type 1 diabetes have intracellular magnesium 
deficiency.82 This is likely due to osmotic diuresis and 
increased magnesuria caused by high glucose levels and 
damage to the renal tubules. Patients with type 2 diabetes 
have been found with lower magnesium levels compared 
with healthy controls (0.79 mmol/L vs 0.88 mmol/L).83
Supplementing with calcium can lead to magnesium 
deficiency due to competitive inhibition for absorption,84 
and oversupplementing with vitamin D may lead to 
magnesium deficiency via excessive calcium absorption 
and hence increase the risk of arterial calcifications.85 
Use of diuretics and other medications can also lead to 
magnesium deficiency.
Over 42% of young (aged 15–18 years) sportsmen 
(volleyball players and rowers) are magnesium-deficient 
based on a high retention after an oral magnesium load. 
The authors of the study concluded ‘…the magnesium 
load test a more sensitive indicator of latent Mg defi-
ciency than the serum Mg level which is maintained at 
a relatively stable level and declines only in severe defi-
ciency’.86 Another study concluded ‘…athletes suffer 
from a magnesium deficiency, partially due to phys-
ical exercise’.87 At a minimum, approximately 15 mg of 
magnesium is lost in sweat per day, but losses are prob-
ably greater especially in conditions of increased perspi-
ration (exercise, heat and humidity).88 Box 1 covers renal 
magnesium wasting. Box 2 provides a comprehensive list 
of potential causes of magnesium deficiency.
CliniCal signs of MagnesiuM defiCienCy
‘…magnesium is essential for the normal metabolism of 
potassium and of calcium…the occurrence in clinical 
situations of otherwise unexplained hypokalemia and 
hypocalcemia should suggest the possibility of significant 
magnesium depletion’.89
Among the most common laboratory signs of magne-
sium deficiency are low potassium and calcium levels, as 
well as low urine and/or faecal magnesium. The most 
common neurological side effect with magnesium deple-
tion is the Trousseau sign; that is, ‘To elicit the sign, a 
blood pressure cuff is placed around the arm and inflated 
to a pressure greater than the systolic blood pressure and 
held in place for 3 min. This will occlude the brachial 
artery. In the absence of blood flow, the patient’s hypo-
calcemia and subsequent neuromuscular irritability will 
induce spasm of the muscles of the hand and forearm. 
The wrist and metacarpophalangeal joints flex, the DIP 
and PIP joints extend, and the fingers adduct’.90 Other 
signs of magnesium deficiency included tremor, fascicula-
tions (‘a brief spontaneous contraction that affects a small 
number of muscle fibres.’91), spontaneous carpopedal 
spasm (painful cramps of the muscles in your hands and 
feet) and generalised spasticity.89 Other clinical features 
of magnesium deficiency include mental disturbances 
such as depression, confusion, agitation, hallucinations, 
weakness, neuromuscular irritability (tremor), athetoid 
movements and convulsive seizures.80
A full list of potential clinical and lab signs of magne-
sium deficiency are summarised in box 3 and box 4.

Coronary artery disease
diagnosing MagnesiuM defiCienCy
‘The existence of subacute or chronic magnesium defi-
ciency is difficult to diagnose. Because the tissues damaged 
by magnesium depletion are those of the cardiovascular, 
renal and the neuromuscular systems, early damage is 
not readily detectable. It is postulated that long-term 
suboptimal intakes of magnesium may participate in the 
pathogenesis of chronic diseases of these systems’.88
Magnesium deficiency is extremely hard to diagnose 
since symptoms are generally non-specific, there are 
numerous contributing factors, and there is no simple 
easy way to diagnose magnesium deficiency.29 80 However, 
one study concluded: ‘There is Mg deficiency in many 
patients with variant angina and it is corrected after treat-
ment with calcium antagonists’.92 The authors noted 
that the mean 24-hour magnesium retention of an intra-
venous magnesium load was 60% in those with variant 
angina versus 36% in controls despite both groups having 
the same normal serum magnesium levels (2.1 mg/dL).
Gastrointestinal loss of magnesium can be determined 
by increased renal conservations of magnesium measured 
by a fractional magnesium excretion of less than 2%.93 
Renal magnesium wasting can be determined by a frac-
tional magnesium excretion above 2% in patients with 
normal renal function.
thoren’s intravenous magnesium load test (16 hours)
Thoren has suggested that if less than 70% of a 30 mEq 
(~365 mg) to 40 mEq (~486 mg) of parenteral magne-
sium given over an hour to an adult is excreted in the 
following 16 hours, this may indicate magnesium defi-
ciency. In other words if you give ~400 mg of magnesium 
intravenously over 1 hour, if 70% or more of that dose 
(so 280 mg or more) is not excreted in the urine over the 
next 16 hours, this likely indicates magnesium deficiency 
even in the presence of normal magnesium levels.37 An 
important flaw of this test is in patients who have renal 
damage who are spilling magnesium out in the urine who 
could appear magnesium-replete but in actuality could 
be magnesium-deficient (in this instance the magnesium 
in the serum would likely be low or low-normal).

2. If <70% of the magnesium load comes out in the urine 
over 16 hours, this is highly suggestive of magnesium 
deficiency.
Healthy subjects have been noted to have an intra-
venous magnesium load retention between 2% and 
8%.47 Corroborating these findings are another study 
that found an average magnesium retention from an 
intravenous load to be 6.3% in healthy patients aged 
18–66 years old.94 The 97.5% fractile was retention of 
27.5%. A large percentage of patients who are consid-
ered healthy can be magnesium-deficient. Based on 
these results an intravenous magnesium load retention 
above 27.5% is highly suggestive of magnesium defi-
ciency. In fact, one study in healthy patients found a 
6% 24-hour magnesium retention after an intravenous 
magnesium load in young controls but a 28% reten-
tion in the elderly, suggesting that a large percentage 
of the elderly population is magnesium-deficient.95 The 
authors of the study concluded: ‘This study suggests 
that a significant subclinical magnesium deficit, not 
detected by serum magnesium, was present in many of 
these healthy elderly subjects. Magnesium supplementa-
tion improved magnesium status and renal function’.95 
If using 2 SD above the mean intravenous magnesium 
retention in normal younger healthy patients, an abnor-
mally high magnesium retention would be approxi-
mately 28%. This suggests that about half of all elderly 
patients may be magnesium-deficient (a level very close 
to the 27.5% retention level found as the upper bound 
in healthy patients aged 18–66 years).94
The intravenous magnesium load test has been given 
as 0.2 mmol/kg MgSO4 over 4 hours96 (or around 
340 mg of magnesium for a 70 kg person). One proce-
dure has given magnesium sulfate MgSO4 (0.2 mmol/kg 
body weight) in 250 mL of 5% dextrose in water at 09:00 
over 4 hours. Twenty-four-hour urine samples were then 
collected starting from the initiation of the infusion to 
determine 24-hour urinary magnesium excretion. Base-
line 24-hour urinary magnesium excretion was then 
subtracted from postinfusion 24-hour urinary magne-
sium excretion. The magnesium retention was then 
calculated by the total amount of magnesium infused 
− (postinfusion 24-hour urinary magnesium − baseline 
24-hour urinary magnesium) × 100/total amount of 
magnesium infused.96 Box 5 provides measurements

for more than one month, and then continue with a dose 
that holds the serum value not lower than 0.9 mmol/L 
magnesium’.36 The authors noted that using a cut-off of 
0.75 mmol/L for magnesium deficiency misses 50% of 
those with true magnesium deficiency.
ConsequenCes of MagnesiuM defiCienCy
hypertension
‘Magnesium status has a direct effect upon the relaxa-
tion capability of vascular smooth muscle cells and the 
regulation of the cellular placement of other cations 
important to blood pressure - cellular sodium:potassium 
(Na:K) ratio and intracellular calcium (iCa(2+)). As a 
result, nutritional magnesium has both direct and indi-
rect impacts on the regulation of blood pressure and 
therefore on the occurrence of hypertension’.97
It must be remembered that there is magnesium- 
ATP-driven 
sodium-potassium 
pump 
and 
calcium 
pump.97 Magnesium deficiency leads to dysfunction 
of the Na-K-ATPase depleting intracellular K and 
increasing intracellular sodium and calcium in cardiac 
and smooth muscle cells. This can cause vasoconstriction 
of venous smooth muscles and arteries causing hyper-
tension.3 Magnesium deficiency may also predispose to 
an increased response to vasoconstrictors, such as angio-
tensin II and catecholamines.98
Many patients with hypertension are treated with thia-
zide and loop diuretics, both of which deplete the body of 
magnesium,99 and giving patients with hypertension who 
are receiving long-term thiazide diuretics oral magnesium 
supplementation significantly reduces blood pressure.99 
In fact, the high intracellular calcium induced by magne-
sium deficiency may induce both insulin resistance and 
hypertension.100 A meta-analysis of randomised, double-
blind, placebo-controlled trials in normotensive and 
hypertensive adults found that 368 mg/day of magnesium 
for a median of 3 months significantly reduces systolic 
blood pressure by 2.00 mm Hg and diastolic blood pres-
sure by 1.78 mm Hg.101 In fact, a meta-analysis of seven 
studies encompassing 135 patients with hypertension on 
antihypertensive medications with a mean starting blood 
pressure >155 mm Hg found that magnesium supplemen-
tation reduced blood pressure by −18.7/–10.9 mm Hg.102 
Another meta-analysis of 22 trials using a mean dose of 
410 mg of magnesium found a significant reduction in 
systolic (3–4 mm Hg) and diastolic (2–3 mm Hg) blood 
pressure. The effect on blood pressure was greater when 
magnesium doses >370 mg/day were used.
Low magnesium levels can promote endothelial cell 
dysfunction, potentially increasing the risk of throm-
bosis and atherosclerosis.103 Magnesium deficiency also 
promotes a proatherogenic phenotype in endothelial 
cells.104 Hypomagnesaemia can impair the release of 
nitric oxide from the coronary endothelium,105 while 
magnesium therapy can improve endothelium-de-
pendent vasodilation in patients with coronary artery 
disease.105 Since nitric oxide is both a vasodilator and an 
box 5 Measurements to diagnose magnesium deficiency (best to 
worst)
reliable methods
 
► Retention of magnesium load (intravenous or oral) after its 
administration80 216 is likely the best indicator of magnesium 
deficiency. However, the retention test assumes normal 
kidney function for intravenous magnesium loads and normal 
gastrointestinal and renal function for oral load tests and is 
cumbersome and invasive.
 
► Mononuclear cell magnesium217 218 and muscle magnesium 
content219 (muscle biopsy).
less reliable methods
 
► Hair magnesium content220 221 (one study concluded: ‘magnesium 
hair concentration may be an easier, cheaper and less invasive 
indicator of body magnesium depletion’).220
 
► Bone magnesium (magnesium depletion in the coccyx may 
indicate magnesium deficiency).8 23
 
► Ratio of ionised magnesium to total magnesium222 (serum or 
plasma).
 
► Ionised magnesium levels223 224 (serum or erythrocytes, ionised 
magnesium is the physiologically active magnesium not bound to 
proteins). However, this biomarker is controversial and not always 
available in clinical labs and hard to measure reliably.
 
► Lymphocyte magnesium.225
 
► Urinary or faecal magnesium excretion8 89 (low or high levels may 
indicate deficiency).
 
► Urinary fractional magnesium excretion >4%226 (some authors 
have suggested >2% in those with normal kidney function).93
 
► Total erythrocyte magnesium levels227 (magnesium deficiency 
has been suggested when erythrocyte magnesium levels 
are <1.65 mmol/L).13
 
► Total serum magnesium levels.
 
► It is important to note that choosing only one of the 
aforementioned methods of measuring magnesium deficiency 
is not appropriate for diagnosing magnesium deficiency. In 
general, either symptoms of magnesium deficiency must 
accompany the more reliable methods to diagnose magnesium 
deficiency (eg, intravenous/oral magnesium load, mononuclear 
cell or muscle), or two or more of the reliable measurements 
(eg, intravenous/oral magnesium load, mononuclear cell or 
muscle) should be used in supporting a diagnosis of magnesium 
deficiency.

► Oversupplementation (mainly from magnesium containing 
antacids).228

inhibitor of platelet aggregation, this makes magnesium 
supplementation a promising therapy in the treatment 
of hypertension and coronary artery disease. Indeed, 
magnesium therapy may enhance prostacyclin release 
from the vascular wall.106
atherosclerosis and calcifications
Magnesium deficiency and magnesium depletion in 
soft tissues can cause calcifications in the heart, liver 
and skeletal muscles.107 Magnesium deficiency may be a 
leading cause of kidney disease as it leads to swelling of 
the tubular epithelium, apatite crystal deposition in the 
proximal convoluted tubules, loops of Henle, collecting 
tubules and in the pars recta.108 Thus, magnesium defi-
ciency damages the kidneys due to calcium deposits 
and may cause numerous electrolyte abnormalities 
(a common problem in patients with chronic kidney 
disease). Other studies in animals show that magnesium 
deficiency causes cardiac necrosis and calcifications.109 
Magnesium deficiency can calcify the descending limb of 
the loop of Henle, which may lead to dehydration and 
volume depletion by reducing water reabsorption.108 A 
greater intake of magnesium is associated with having 
a lower risk of an elevated coronary artery calcification 
score,110 and supplementing with magnesium has been 
found to improve endothelial function in patients with 
coronary artery disease.111
One animal study noted: ‘…the degree of lipid deposi-
tion in the aorta of cholesterol-fed rabbits can be signifi-
cantly enhanced by feeding a magnesium-deficient diet…
The calcification of the inflammatory granuloma of the 
aortas and the atrophy and degeneration of muscle fibres 
with inflammatory connective tissue proliferation in the 
myocardium and in the stomach and skeletal muscles 
were only observed in rabbits fed a magnesium defi-
cient diet’.112 In other words, eating a diet deficient in 
magnesium predisposes to atherosclerosis, calcification 
of the aorta, degeneration of myocardial muscle fibres 
and inflammatory connective tissue throughout the body. 
This study suggests that low magnesium intake increases 
inflammation.
Inadequate dietary magnesium intake increases athero-
sclerotic plaque development in rabbits113 and induces 
myocardial fibrosis similar to what is found in human 
cardiomyopathy endomyocardial fibrosis.114 A diet deficient 
in magnesium in the Cebus monkey causes an increase in 
serum cholesterol, ST segment depression and atheroscle-
rotic plaques in the aorta,115 whereas magnesium fortifica-
tion in drinking water inhibits atherogenesis in female and 
male Low-density lipoprotein (LDL)-receptor-deficient 
mice fed a high-cholesterol diet.116 117
Magnesium treatment for 3 months in patients with 
ischaemic heart disease increases the apolipoprotein 
A1:apolipoprotein B ratio by 13%, decreases the apoli-
poprotein B concentrations by 15%, and decreases very- 
low-density lipoprotein concentrations by 27%.118 Magne-
sium therapy also tended to increase high-density lipopro-
tein. The authors of the study concluded: ‘…magnesium 
deficiency might be involved in the pathogenesis of isch-
emic heart disease by altering the blood lipid composition 
in a way that disposes to atherosclerosis’.118 In hypo-
magnesaemic kidney transplant recipients, magnesium 
supplementation significantly decreases total cholesterol, 
low-density lipoprotein and total cholesterol:high density 
lipoprotein ratio.119 Magnesium deficiency may enhance 
vascular endothelial injury, promoting the development 
and progression of atherosclerosis.120
Magnesium deficiency may supersaturate bodily 
fluids with octacalcium phosphate calcifying soft tissues, 
whereas magnesium therapy may stop or even prevent 
soft tissue calcifications.121 Magnesium deficiency in York-
shire swine induces numerous calcifications and smooth 
muscle cell degeneration, and promotes atherosclerosis 
in combination with an atherogenic diet.122 Hamsters fed 
a magnesium-deficient diet develop myocardial necrosis, 
calcifications and cardiomyopathy. These effects of 
magnesium deficiency seem to be secondary to the inhi-
bition of the Na-K-ATPase and the calcium overload that 
follows in cardiac myocytes.123 Triglyceride-rich lipopro-
teins from magnesium-deficient rats are more susceptible 
to oxidation.124 Thus, magnesium deficiency predisposes 
to lipoprotein peroxidation and atherosclerosis. Perhaps 
most importantly, patients in the intensive cardiac care 
unit have been noted to have low blood mononuclear cell 
magnesium levels.125 The authors summarised their find-
ings as the following: ‘We conclude that the incidence 
of intracellular Mg deficiency in patients with cardiovas-
cular disease is much higher than the serum magnesium 
would lead one to suspect, and may contribute to clinical 
cardiovascular morbidity’.125
arrhythmias
‘Although available on order by physicians, the lack of 
routine serum Mg analysis as part of the ‘electrolyte 
panel’ impedes the diagnosis of clinical Mg deficiency. 
Renal loss of Mg resulting from the widespread use of 
loop diuretics is responsible for significant numbers 
of patients with Mg deficiency and hypomagnesemia. 
Life-threatening cardiac arrhythmias and seizures repre-
sent the most serious manifestation of clinical hypomag-
nesemia and Mg depletion […] Hypomagnesemia is one 
of the most frequent serum electrolyte abnormalities 
in current clinical practice. Routine inclusion of serum 
Mg analysis in the electrolyte panel will enhance the 
clinical recognition and treatment of hypomagnesemic 
Mg-depleted patients. Failure to respond to treatment 
of recurrent ventricular tachycardia/fibrillation to usual 
antiarrhythmic therapy in patients with acute myocar-
dial infarction, idiopathic dilated cardiomyopathy, and 
congestive heart failure should alert the clinician to 
consider administering intravenous Mg’.126
As noted previously, magnesium deficiency reduces 
cardiac Na-K-ATPase, leading to higher levels of sodium 
and calcium and lower levels of magnesium and potassium 
in the heart. This increases vasoconstriction in the coro-
nary arteries, which can induce coronary artery spasms,

Coronary artery disease
myocardial infarction and arrhythmias.127 Considering 
that around 25% of all myocardial infarctions are not due 
to atherosclerotic plaque rupture, coronary artery spasm 
induced by magnesium deficiency may explain some of 
these events.
In one metabolic study of 22 postmenopausal women, 
a low-magnesium diet (containing around 130 mg/
day) significantly increased both supraventricular 
and supraventricular plus ventricular beats based on 
Holter monitor. The authors of the study concluded: 
‘The recommended dietary allowance of 320 mg/day 
seems correct; 130 mg is too little. Persons who live in 
soft water areas, who use diuretics, or who are predis-
posed to magnesium loss or ectopic beats may require 
more dietary magnesium than would others’.128 Another 
study in postmenopausal women found that a low-mag-
nesium diet (approximately 100 mg/day) can induce 
atrial fibrillation and increases glucose levels.129 Patients 
with diabetes mellitus and arrhythmia have been noted 
to have lower serum levels of ionised magnesium.130 
Thus, it appears that low dietary intake of magnesium 
or low magnesium levels can predispose to arrhythmias. 
Diuretics and digoxin also cause magnesium depletion, 
making the heart more susceptible to the development 
of arrhythmias.131
Hypomagnesaemia may induce arrhythmias including 
torsades de pointes ventricular tachycardia.132 Magne-
sium therapy may be useful in the treatment of refractory 
ventricular tachycardia, ventricular fibrillation, multifocal 
atrial tachycardia, atrial fibrillation and supraventricular 
tachycardia.133 A meta-analysis of 19 randomised trials 
using magnesium orotate found a significant reduction in 
first-degree mitral valve prolapse, grade 1 regurgitation, 
supraventricular and ventricular premature contraction, 
and paroxysmal supraventricular tachycardia.134
Coronary artery disease
‘…low heart muscle magnesium may contribute to sudden 
death after myocardial infarction. Western diets are prob-
ably often low in magnesium, so that the magnesium in 
hard drinking water may help to protect its consumers 
from ischemic heart disease…Increasing the magnesium 
content of the diet may help to prevent ischemic heart 
disease, and there is already evidence that magnesium 
salts can have beneficial effects on established heart 
disease’.131
Autopsy studies have revealed lower magnesium 
content in both infarcted and non-infarcted heart muscle 
in those who have died of a myocardial infarction.131 
Furthermore, autopsy studies have noted that those dying 
from accidents have lower heart muscle magnesium in 
soft-water drinking areas versus those from hard-water 
areas. This suggests that patients who have lower than 
normal magnesium concentrations in their heart muscle 
may be more likely to die suddenly after a myocardial 
infarction. Indeed, there are numerous studies indi-
cating an increased rate of death from heart disease in 
low-magnesium drinking water areas.131
Magnesium is required for the formation and activa-
tion of ATP and is essential for heart muscle contraction 
and oxidative phosphorylation in heart mitochon-
dria.131 There is also a rapid loss of myocardial magne-
sium during anoxia, suggesting that chronic angina 
leads to magnesium deficiency. Chipperfield and Chip-
perfield131 noted: ‘Magnesium-deficient diets…predis-
pose animals to the development of myocardial fiber 
necrosis. Administration of magnesium salts has been 
shown to reverse many of the changes in animal models 
of heart disease…There is also good evidence from 
some animal studies that pretreatment with magnesium 
salts protects against many of the changes in the heart 
caused by anoxia…’ In other words, consuming a diet 
high in magnesium may prevent the harms from an 
acute ischaemic events.
Just 42–64 days on a diet low in magnesium 
(~101 mg/day) produced atrial fibrillation and flutter 
in three of five postmenopausal women (ages 47–75 
years). Moreover, the arrhythmias responded quickly 
to magnesium supplementation. During the low-mag-
nesium diet, glucose levels increased and red blood cell 
superoxide dismutase decreased. The authors of the 
study concluded: ‘A dietary intake of about 4.12 mmol 
(~101 mg/day, my insertion) Mg/8.4 MJ is inadequate 
for healthy adults and may result in compromised 
cardiovascular health and glycemic control in post-
menopausal women’.129
In a randomised, double-blind, placebo controlled 
study on 350 patients with acute myocardial infarc-
tion, intravenous magnesium sulfate given immediately 
after completion of thrombolytic therapy significantly 
reduced all-cause mortality (3.5% vs 9.9%, P<0.01) and 
ventricular arrhythmias (13% vs 48.6%, P=0.00001).135 
There was also a numerical reduction in reinfarction 
(8.8% vs 12.7%, P value not significant).
Magnesium deficiency in swine leads to proaggrega-
tory and procoagulation alterations,136 and in humans 
leads to increased thromboxane synthesis.137 In rats, 
magnesium deficiency increases thromboxane B2 
outflow.138 Magnesium treatment has been found to 
inhibit thrombus formation (as measured by plate-
let-dependent thrombosis) in patients with stable coro-
nary artery disease by 35%.105 These effects are additive 
to that of aspirin and are independent of platelet aggre-
gation. One author concluded: ‘High dose of intrave-
nous magnesium can inhibit thrombus formation and 
is associated with suppression of platelet aggregation. 
Magnesium treatment can dose-dependently inhibit a 
wide variety of agonists of platelet aggregation, such as 
thromboxane A2 and stimulate prostacyclin synthesis. 
The molecular basis for these effects is likely modulated 
via reduction of intracellular calcium mobilization’.105 
Thus, magnesium may prevent thrombotic events and 
may also protect cardiac cells against ischaemia.139
Platelet-dependent thrombosis is significantly higher 
in patients with stable coronary artery disease with low 
intracellular magnesium levels.140 Administration of

intravenous magnesium to healthy volunteers signifi-
cantly inhibits both ADP-induced platelet aggregation 
by 40% and binding of fibrinogen or surface expres-
sion of GMP-140 by 30%.141 Thus, magnesium therapy 
also has antiplatelet effects. In rats, intravenous magne-
sium therapy inhibits arterial thrombi after vascular 
injury.142 All of these suggest that magnesium is an anti-
thrombotic and antiplatelet agent and that magnesium 
deficiency may promote thrombosis. Furthermore, 
magnesium deficiency appears to be more prevalent 
in patients with coronary artery disease or ischaemic 
heart disease, suggesting a need for magnesium treat-
ment.143 144 Box 8 provides a summary of possible 
cardiovascular manifestations of magnesium deficiency.
ConClusion
Subclinical magnesium deficiency is a common and 
under-recognised problem throughout the world. Impor-
tantly, subclinical magnesium deficiency does not mani-
fest as clinically apparent symptoms and thus is not easily 
recognised by the clinician. Despite this fact, subclin-
ical magnesium deficiency likely leads to hypertension, 
arrhythmias, arterial calcifications, atherosclerosis, heart 
failure and an increased risk for thrombosis. This suggests 
that subclinical magnesium deficiency is a principal, yet 
under-recognised, driver of cardiovascular disease. A 
greater public health effort is needed to inform both the 
patient and clinician about the prevalence, harms and 
diagnosis of subclinical magnesium deficiency.
