BACKGROUND: Although patients with blood cancers have significantly lower rates of hospice use than those with solid malignan-
cies, data explaining this gap in end-of-life care are sparse. METHODS: In 2015, we conducted a mailed survey of a randomly selected
sample of hematologic oncologists in the United States to characterize their perspectives regarding the utility and adequacy of hos-
pice for blood cancer patients, as well as factors that might impact referral patterns. Simultaneous provision of care for patients with
solid malignancies was permitted. RESULTS: We received 349 surveys (response rate, 57.3%). The majority of respondents (68.1%)
strongly agreed that hospice care is helpful for patients with hematologic cancers; those with practices including greater numbers of
solid tumor patients (at least 25%) were more likely to strongly agree (odds ratio, 2.10; 95% confidence interval, 1.26-3.52). Despite
high levels of support for hospice in general, 46.0% felt that home hospice is inadequate for their patients’ needs (as compared to in-
patient hospice with round-the-clock care). Although more than half of the respondents reported that they would be more likely to
refer patients to hospice if red cell and/or platelet transfusions were available, those who considered home hospice inadequate were
even more likely to report that they would (67.3% vs 55.3% for red cells [P 5 .03] and 52.9% vs 39.7% for platelets [P 5 .02]). CON-
CLUSIONS: These data suggest that although hematologic oncologists value hospice, concerns about the adequacy of services for
blood cancer patients limit hospice referrals. To increase hospice enrollment for blood cancer patients, interventions tailoring hospice
services to their specific needs are warranted. Cancer 2017;123:3377-84. V

INTRODUCTION
Since the establishment of the first US hospice program in 1974, empirical evidence has increasingly demonstrated
its positive impact on the care of patients with life-limiting illnesses.1-4 For example, hospice enrollment has been
shown to improve patient quality of life at the end of life (EOL) and lower the risk of psychiatric disorders among
bereaved caregivers.2,4 A recent analysis also demonstrated that patients with poor-prognosis cancers who receive
hospice care have a lower incidence of hospital admissions, intensive care unit admissions, and invasive procedures
during the last year of life in comparison with those who are not admitted to hospice.3 In light of accruing evi-
dence regarding its benefits, timely hospice enrollment is now endorsed as an indicator of high-quality EOL
care.5,6 Indeed, hospice is a widely established model of symptom-directed care for patients with an estimated life
expectancy of 6 months or less.
Although hospice is now recognized as a vital aspect of EOL care, only a minority of patients who die of hematologic
cancers in the United States enroll. Moreover, they have the lowest rates of hospice use among all oncology patients.7-9 In
a large population-based analysis of 215,800 individuals aged 65 years or older who died of cancer between 1991 and
2000, blood cancer patients were the least likely to enroll in hospice, and when they did enroll, they were likely to spend
less time there compared to other patients.8 About a decade later, a study of more than 64,000 patients demonstrated simi-
lar results: patients with hematologic cancers had 52% higher odds of a hospice length of stay � 3 days compared to those
with solid malignancies.9
Few studies have explored the causes of lower rates of hospice use among patients with hematologic malignan-
cies.10,11 Specifically, it is not known whether hematologic oncologists’ views about the utility of hospice or services avail-
able in hospice settings explain the low rates of hospice enrollment for patients with blood cancers. In addition, data are
limited regarding factors that may influence hospice referral practices of hematologic oncologists. We thus surveyed a

 national sample of US-based hematologic oncologists to
characterize their perspectives regarding the usefulness of
hospice for patients with blood cancers and their referral
practices. Given that in oncology, the current hospice
model is largely designed to support the needs of patients
with metastatic solid tumors (eg, pain control), we hy-
pothesized that hematologic oncologists who predomi-
nantly provide care for blood cancer patients would be
less likely to consider hospice to be helpful. Moreover,
given prior literature regarding the intensive caregiving
needs of blood cancer patients at the EOL coupled with
the fact that the US model of hospice is predominantly
outpatient/home-based,12 we hypothesized that most
respondents would consider home hospice to be inade-
quate for the level of care required for this patient
population.
MATERIALS AND METHODS
Study Population
We conducted a mailed survey of US-based hematologic
oncologists providing care for adult blood cancer patients.
We identified potential participants from the clinical di-
rectory of the American Society of Hematology. This
Web-based directory provides the practice addresses, tele-
phone numbers, and clinical interests of hematologic
oncologists. Screening telephone calls were placed to the
practices of all listed adult hematologic oncologists to con-
firm their eligibility (ie, “does doctor X take care of blood
cancer patients?”) and the validity of their mailing
addresses. Simultaneous provision of care for patients
with solid malignancies was permitted.
Data Collection
We administered our survey between September 2014
and January 2015 to a total of 667 hematologic oncolo-
gists. Subjects received an express mail package that in-
cluded a cover letter, the survey, an opt-out card (with the
opportunity to check a box reporting that the physician
does not routinely treat blood cancers), a postage-paid re-
turn envelope, and a $25 gift card. Subjects were also giv-
en the option to complete the survey online. Reminder
postcards were sent 2 and 4 weeks after the initial mailing,
and a telephone reminder call was made by a physician in-
vestigator (O.O.O.) at 6 weeks to nonrespondents. An-
other mailing was sent to nonrespondents in January
2015 to encourage participation. All study procedures
were approved by the institutional review board of the
Dana-Farber/Harvard Cancer Center.
Survey Instrument
The survey instrument included 30 questions examining
various aspects of EOL care for patients with hematologic
cancers. The survey was developed with qualitative data
from hematologic oncologists,11 adaptation of previously
published instruments,13-16 and literature review. The
survey was pilot-tested and revised according to feedback
from cognitive debriefing with 5 practicing hematologic
oncologists.
To examine perspectives regarding hospice, we asked
participants, using a 5-point Likert scale ranging from
“strongly disagree” to “strongly agree,” how strongly they
agreed with the following statement: “Hospice care is
helpful for my patients.” They were also asked to rate their
level of agreement with several other statements regarding
the adequacy of hospice services for blood cancer patients
and factors that might impact referral practices:
1. “I feel home hospice is not adequate for the level of
care some of my patients need.”
2. “My patients feel home hospice is not adequate for the
level of care they need.”
3. “I would rather refer my patients to an inpatient hos-
pice facility than home hospice.”
4. “I would refer more patients to hospice if red blood cell
transfusions were allowed.”
5. “I would refer more patients to hospice if platelet trans-
fusions were allowed.”
6. “I would refer more patients to hospice if I were able to
have clinic visits with them more often.”
Several of these statements focused on home hospice
because this is the prevalent model of providing hospice
care in the United States and also because there are strin-
gent admission criteria for the general inpatient level of
hospice care, which are largely based on the management
of pain crises. We also asked participants, using a 5-point
Likert scale, whether they agreed with the following state-
ment: “If I were terminally ill with cancer, I would enroll
in hospice.” Of note, the survey instructions specified that
questions referred to hematologic malignancies only.
Respondents provided personal and practice characteris-
tics, including age, sex, years since medical school gradua-
tion, board certification, academic center affiliation,
practice setting, and provision of hematopoietic cell trans-
plant care.
Statistical Analysis
We first descriptively summarized perspectives regarding
hospice. We then conducted univariable analyses (chi-
square tests) to assess which factors were associated with

 perceptions about the utility of hospice and preferences
regarding whether respondents would enroll in hospice if
they themselves were terminally ill with cancer. We chose
to dichotomize responses into strong agreement versus
other for the aforementioned analyses for 2 reasons. First,
given that hospice is endorsed as a marker of high-quality
EOL care, we felt that social desirability might influence
respondents to agree that hospice is helpful and that
strong agreement would be more reflective of true belief
in hospice’s utility. Second, the survey from which we
adapted the item regarding personal hospice preferences
was analyzed with this same dichotomy.16,17
Next, we created multivariable logistic regression
models to identify factors independently associated with
1) strong agreement that hospice is helpful and 2) strong
agreement to enroll in hospice if terminally ill. The mod-
els included factors with significance levels of P < .10
from the univariable analysis; we planned to force sex and
years since graduation from medical school into the mod-
els, regardless of significance. Finally, referral practices as-
sociated with agreement/strong agreement that home
hospice is not adequate for patients with hematologic can-
cers were examined descriptively with chi-square tests. All
analyses were conducted with SAS 9.4 (SAS, Cary, NC).
RESULTS
Characteristics of Respondents
Among the 667 hematologic oncologists surveyed, 58
were ultimately ineligible because they reported on their
opt-out card that they were not routinely providing care
to adult patients with blood cancers even though they had
been screened with prior telephone calls (n 5 29) or they
were no longer at the American Society of Hematology di-
rectory address and had no known forwarding address (n
5 29). Of the 609 eligible respondents, 349 hematologic
oncologists from 48 states completed the survey (response
rate, 57.3%). Men constituted 75.6% of the cohort, the
median age was 52 years (interquartile range, 44-60
years), and the median number of years since medical
school graduation was 25 (interquartile range, 17-33).
Slightly over half of the respondents (51.6%) reported
that at least 25% of their patients had solid tumors. Addi-
tional respondent characteristics are noted in Table 1.

Hospice Care for Blood Cancer Patients
Among those who answered all questions regarding hos-
pice care for their blood cancer patients, the majority
strongly agreed that hospice is helpful (68.1%; Fig. 1). In
adjusted multivariable analysis, respondents who were
>15 years from medical school graduation were more
likely to strongly agree that hospice is helpful (odds ratio
[OR], 2.42; 95% confidence interval [CI], 1.38-4.22),
and those who reported that at least 25% of their patients
had a solid malignancy had higher odds of strongly agree-
ing that hospice is helpful (OR, 2.10; 95% CI, 1.26-3.52;
Table 2).
A substantial proportion (46.0%) agreed or strongly
agreed that home hospice is not adequate for the level of
care that their patients need, and 26.8% agreed or strongly
agreed they would refer more patients if they could con-
tinue to have regular clinic visits after hospice begins.
With respect to transfusions, 61.7% agreed or strongly
agreed that they would refer more patients to hospice if
red cell and/or platelet transfusions were allowed. More-
over, 60.8% agreed or strongly agreed that they would re-
fer more patients if red cell transfusions were allowed, and

 45.6% would do so if platelet transfusions were allowed.
Those who considered home hospice to be inadequate
were even more likely to report that they would refer more
patients if red cell (67.3% vs 55.3%; P 5 .03) or platelet
transfusions (52.9% vs 39.7%; P 5 .02) were allowed,
and if they could continue to have regular clinic visits
(36.0% vs 19.0%; P 5 .0005).
Personal Preference Regarding Hospice
Enrollment if Terminally Ill
More than half of the respondents (52.4%) strongly
agreed that they would enroll in hospice if they themselves
were terminally ill with cancer. In adjusted multivariable
models, hematologic oncologists who had previously ro-
tated on a palliative care or hospice service (OR, 1.97;
95% CI, 1.08-3.58) and those for whom �25% of their
practice consisted of patients with solid tumors (OR,
1.99; 95% CI, 1.28-3.11; Table 3) were more likely to
strongly agree that they themselves would enroll in
hospice.
DISCUSSION
In this national sample of hematologic oncologists, the
majority strongly agreed that hospice care is helpful for
patients with blood cancers, and slightly more than half
strongly agreed that they themselves would enroll in hos-
pice if they were terminally ill with cancer. These percep-
tions were more positive among hematologic oncologists
who also reported seeing a substantial number of patients
with solid tumors. Despite the overall positive perception,
a significant proportion of respondents felt that home
hospice is not adequate for the level of care needed for
blood cancer patients. Moreover, those who considered
home hospice to be inadequate were more likely to report
that they would increase referrals if transfusions were read-
ily available. Taken together, these findings suggest that
although hematologic oncologists value hospice, rates of
referral are relatively low because the current hospice
model may not meet the practical needs of blood cancer
patients.
Indeed, given low rates of timely hospice use among
blood cancer patients,7-10 our finding that most hemato-
logic oncologists considered hospice care to be helpful was
surprising. This finding suggests that the perceived utility
of hospice by hematologic oncologists is not a substantial
contributor to hospice underuse among patients with
blood cancers. The discordance between the stated belief
that hospice is helpful and the revealed experience of low
hospice rates for patients with blood cancers may be partly
explained by the viewpoint held by several respondents
that home hospice is not adequate for the level of care
needed.
A recent study showed that needs of patients with
hematologic cancers who enrolled in hospice were dis-
tinct from those with solid malignancies in that they
were more seriously ill, had worse functional status, and
were more likely to need hospice services in inpatient
settings.12 Indeed, this difference in symptom burden
may explain our finding that hematologic oncologists
with very few or no solid tumor patients in their practice

 had less favorable perceptions of hospice. The need for
transfusions for some blood cancer patients may also
discourage enrollment.7,10,11 For example, in a study of
patients with myelodysplastic syndromes, those who
were transfusion-dependent had significantly lower
odds of enrolling. Moreover, the fact that pain—a major
focus of hospice—is less prevalent among patients with
hematologic cancers versus patients with solid malig-
nancies may further foster the viewpoint that hospice
services are less relevant.10
Our data suggest that rather than further edu-
cating hematologic oncologists on the value of hos-
pice, interventions that tailor hospice services to their
specific patient needs are more likely to be effective
at increasing enrollment. Respondents who consid-

patients were more likely to report that they would
increase hospice referrals if certain care elements con-
sidered important for blood cancer patients could be
provided. Moreover, even among respondents who
considered home hospice to be adequate, the majority
reported that they would refer more patients if red
cell transfusions were allowed.
Although transfusions are palliative in nature,
most hospices are unable to provide this resource in
the United States because payers such as Medicare

a The multivariable model included variables with P < .10 in the univariable analysis. Because proportion of solid malignancy patients in a practice was colinear
with practice setting (tertiary setting vs community setting) and academic center affiliation status, only proportion of solid malignancy patients was included in
the model. Similarly, because age and years since medical school graduation were colinear, only time since medical school graduation was included in the

 reimburse at a fixed daily rate per patient, regardless
of the actual services provided. Accordingly, interven-
tions to make additional resources available through
hospice will necessitate policy changes regarding hos-
pice reimbursement. Although there would be added
costs for the provision of transfusions, there would
likely be concomitant cost savings through increased
hospice enrollment, which would lead to a reduction
in terminal hospitalizations and/or intensive, noneffi-
cacious treatments.3,18,19
Our finding that more than a quarter of the
respondents would refer more patients to hospice “if
they could have clinic visits with them more often” like-
ly reflects a desire of hematologic oncologists to main-
tain face-to-face involvement in their patients’ care,
even when the treatment phase has passed.20 The vary-
ing disease trajectories of hematologic cancers—some
with chronic courses requiring frequent and long-term
follow-up and others with high-intensity courses that
necessitate weeks of inpatient care with close outpatient
follow-up—foster
strong
patient-provider
bonds.
Moreover, hematologic oncologists may be concerned
that their patients would feel a sense of abandonment if
they are no longer visibly involved in their care. Given
that arranging travel to clinic visits while patients are in
hospice is burdensome, this issue could be potentially
addressed with innovative models that include so-called
shared care or telemedicine.21

 Although external factors may impact hospice refer-
rals, physicians’ personal preferences regarding the care
that they themselves would like to receive at the EOL have
also been shown to influence their approach to EOL care
with patients.17,22 While most of our respondents strong-
ly agreed that they would enroll in hospice if they were ter-
minally ill (52.4%), the proportion was lower than what
was found in a prior survey of solid tumor oncologists
asked the same question (64.5%).17 This variation in per-
sonal preferences may partly account for differences in
hospice referrals by hematologic oncologists.8,9 On the
other hand, their clinical experience of taking care of
blood cancer patients near the EOL and resulting percep-
tions regarding the inadequacy of hospice may actually
drive their personal preferences.
Our study has limitations. First, social desirability
bias may have influenced hematologic oncologists’
responses such that a large number reported that they felt
hospice is helpful; we attempted to account for this possi-
bility by focusing our analyses on those reporting strong
agreement. Second, because our survey asked about blood
cancers in general, our data may not capture views about
the adequacy of hospice for specific hematologic cancers.
For example, it is possible that several hematologic oncol-
ogists consider hospice inadequate for patients with acute
leukemia because transfusion support is a common need
for this population. Conversely, many may consider hos-
pice particularly suitable for patients with myeloma be-
cause the need for pain control is highly prevalent.23
Third, our survey focused on views regarding hospice and
rates of referral and did not specifically elicit perspectives
regarding timeliness of referral or length of hospice stay.
Fourth, our data describe hematologic oncologists’ self-
reports of potential changes in referral practices based on
theoretical factors (eg, the availability of transfusions) and
may not reflect how such factors would actually change
practice. Finally, despite an acceptable response rate for a
physician survey and although there were no significant
differences between respondents and nonrespondents
based on sex and region of practice, our analysis may still
suffer from participation bias associated with characteris-
tics not captured.
The National Hospice and Palliative Care Organiza-
tion defines hospice as a “model for quality, compassion-
ate care for people facing a life-limiting illness . . . [that]
involves a team-oriented approach to expert medical care,
pain management, and emotional and spiritual support
expressly tailored to the patient’s needs and wishes.”24
Our analysis suggests that most hematologic oncologists
value the hospice philosophy; however, they are less sup-
portive when asked questions assessing whether hospice is
“expressly tailored” to the needs of patients with blood
cancers. Moreover, new models of hospice that more ex-
pansively address these needs—such as allowing red cell
