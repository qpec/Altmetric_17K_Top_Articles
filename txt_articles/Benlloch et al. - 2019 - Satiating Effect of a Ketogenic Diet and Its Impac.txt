Abstract:
Background:
It was previously established that Multiple sclerosis (MS) generates
energy alterations at the mitochondrial level related to the loss of muscle mass. Ketone bodies,
mainly beta-hydroxybutyrate (BHB), re-establish this energy alteration causing satiety, changes in
body composition and a decrease in hormone-dependant hunger, such as ghrelin. The aim of this
study was to establish possible improvements in body composition and the level of oxidation in
patients with MS, by means of the satiating effect of a ketogenic diet. Methods: A pilot study was
carried out with 27 MS patients who were given a Mediterranean isocaloric and ketogenic diet for
4 months. Anthropometric measurements, as well as satiety and hunger perception (VAS scale),
were taken. In addition, BHB and paraoxonase 1 (PON1), as an oxidation marker, were measured by
spectrophotometric automated assays, and ghrelin was determined by an enzyme immunoassay in the
serum. All measurements were taken before and after the intervention. Results: A significant increase
in satiety perception at lunch and dinner and of BHB in the blood was obtained. Hunger perception
decreased significantly at lunch and dinner with similar levels of ghrelin. In addition, an important
increase in lean mass and PON1 was observed. To our knowledge, this is the first study addressing
improvements in body composition, oxidation state and metabolism in MS patients, based on the
satiating effect of a Mediterranean isocaloric diet. Conclusion: A ketogenic diet increases lean mass
and decreases inflammation and oxidation possibly as a consequence of an increase in satiety and
decrease in hunger in MS patients.

1. Introduction
Multiple sclerosis (MS) is a neurodegenerative disease of an autoimmune nature that produces
inflammation and demyelination on the sheath of neurons, therefore altering energy activity of axons

on a mitochondrial level [1–3]. This leads to a degenerative process due to the lack of trophic support
provided by myelin. Some of the physical consequences include muscle loss or changes [4,5], directly
associated with a deterioration in the complex I enzyme of the mitochondrial respiratory chain [4].
This deterioration involves lower muscle mitochondrial capacities, 40% less than a healthy person.
Ketone bodies have neuroprotective effects in energy alterations at a mitochondrial level which
have been demonstrated in several neurological disorders, such as epilepsy [6,7], Parkinson’s disease [8]
or Alzheimer’s disease [9]. This neuroprotection is based on different mechanisms. On the one hand,
the beta-hydroxybutyrate (BHB) ketone body is part of a group of hydroxycarboxylic acids able
to activate certain hydroxy-carboxylic acid (HCA) receptors that help to maintain homeostasis by
changing metabolic and dietary conditions and being able to be used in metabolic and inflammatory
disorders. On the other hand, ketogenic diets could cause changes in the way the brain’s energy levels
are used, increasing the medium-chain triglycerides (MCT)1 and MCT4 transporters and decreasing
the glucose transporter 1 (GLUT1) transporter, which are responsible for transporting ketone bodies
and glucose, respectively, through the blood-brain barrier (BBB), especially in the hippocampus and the
prefrontal cortex [10], regions which are deteriorated in MS patients [11,12]. Furthermore, ketone bodies
are involved in other mechanisms related to muscle function. Thus, BHB has pleiotropic effects that
convert it into a metabolite that regulates oxidation stress and inflammation [13], being a prime and/or
characteristic factor of conditions related to muscle atrophy. Therefore, ketone bodies show anabolic
and anti-catabolic activity in skeletal muscle [14–16], especially in BHB activity [17]. Finally, ketone
bodies restore the activity of complex 1 of the electron transport chain [18] that is deteriorated in MS.
Previous studies relate ketone bodies to an increase in satiety [19,20]. The mechanism on which
this satiety effect is based is complex and depends on the relation that is established with several
hormones and metabolites, mainly on a peripheral level. Nonetheless, the effect of fat oxidation by
astrocytes at the brain level seems particularly relevant. This oxidation produces ketone bodies that
activate the ventromedial nucleus of the hypothalamus, which is directly related to satiety, and which
varies throughout the day according to the intake of these fats [21]. As a consequence of this satiating
effect, changes in body composition characterised by weight loss are produced [22,23], related to lower
resistance to insulin and a low atherogenic lipid panel [24]. Meanwhile, an increase in lean mass is
shown; therefore, weight loss would be mainly based on a lower amount of body fat [25,26].
Medium-chain triglycerides (MCTs) made up of medium-chain fatty acids (MCFAs) are the most
important source for ketone bodies. Amongst the different food containing MCTs, coconut oil is most
likely the nutrient with the most MCTs in its composition, as its percentage of MCFAs exceeds 50%
(49% lauric acid, 8% caprylic acid, 7% decanoic acid and a small percentage of hexanoic acid) [27].
MCFAs have a high oxidation rate to obtain energy, avoiding storing it in fatty tissue, and enhancing
further energy use [28] and weight loss without long-term recovery. This effect would be even more
effective and beneficial if ketogenesis was based on a Mediterranean diet [29], which can also contribute
to the satiating effect, if it contained nutrients rich in fibre [30], proteins [31] and complex sugars, due
to its ability to control the glycaemic index [32,33]. Finally, the number of meals could be important, as
a diet distributed over five meals a day has shown to be more satiating [34,35].
In the same sense as the satiating effect, the feeling of hunger also contributes to a correct
energy balance.
This feeling depends on several metabolites and hormones, amongst which is
ghrelin. This hormone is mainly produced in the stomach [36] and can cross the BBB [37], joining its
specific receptor (GHS1a) and finally activating the Y neuropeptide, thus being a powerful appetite
stimulator [38]. Its secretion rhythm is circadian, which increases with fasting and the temporary
time before meals. Regarding its relationship with ketone bodies, a rapid increase in them causes
an immediate decrease in the secretion of ghrelin, as well as appetite and the desire to eat [39].
However, a change in hormone secretion behaviour has been observed in the long term, both for
fasting and postprandial, maintaining similar levels despite a decrease in weight and increase in BHB.
Weight loss diets can be related to dietary imbalances that can cause reactive oxygen species
(ROS) [40] related to cell damage, accelerated ageing and neurodegenerative diseases, such as

Alzheimer’s or Parkinson’s disease [41]. Nonetheless, ketogenic diets have shown improvements in
metabolic and inflammatory markers, including lipid markers, glycated haemoglobin (HbA1c) or
high-sensitive PCR [42], related to an increase in the total antioxidant status in the blood. Paraoxonases
(PONs) are a family of enzymes consisting of PON1, PON2 and PON3. PON1 inhibits low-density
lipoprotein (LDL) oxidation, thus preventing the production of cytokines, inflammatory mediators and
cell adhesion molecules, thereby decreasing the inflammatory response and LDL deposition in blood
vessels [43]. Previous studies have highlighted a correlation between the decrease in PON1 and the
progress of some diseases with high oxidative stress and inflammation. All these indications make it
an inflammatory marker, being especially efficient to establish metabolic improvements. A decrease in
its activity has been observed in patients with MS. Based on the aforementioned, the aim of the study
was to determine the possible improvements in body composition, metabolic markers, such as ketone
bodies (BHB) and ghrelin, and in antioxidant markers, such as PON1 in MS patients, through the
satiating effect of an isocaloric Mediterranean diet rich in fats with a high MCT content.
2. Materials and Methods
A prospective, mixed and quasi-experimental pilot study was conducted by means of a clinical trial.
2.1. Subjects
In order to obtain the population sample, we contacted the main state-wide MS associations,
which informed their members about the nature of the study. The following selection criteria were
applied to the 35 people interested in participating in the study: patients over 18 years of age
diagnosed with MS at least 6 months ago and treated with glatiramer acetate and interferon beta.
Moreover, the exclusion criteria included: pregnant or breastfeeding women, patients with tracheotomy,
stoma or with short bowel syndrome, patients with dementia, evidence of alcohol or drug abuse,
with myocardial infarction, heart failure, cardiac dysrhythmia, symptoms of angina or other heart
conditions, patients with kidney conditions with creatinine levels two times higher than normal
markers, patients with elevated liver markers three times higher than normal or with chronic liver
disease, patients with hyperthyroidism, patients with acromegaly, patients with polycystic ovary
syndrome or MS patients who were included in other researches with experimental drugs or treatment.
2.2. Statistical Analysis
Statistical analysis was performed with the SPSS v.23 (IBM Corporation, Armonk, NY, USA)
tool. The first step aimed to estimate the distribution of the variables investigated through statistical
methods for the assessment of normality, including the Kolmogorov-Smirnov Test. This analysis
demonstrated the non-normal distribution of all the scale variables studied. Therefore, the Wilcoxon
signed-rank test was used to assess changes before and after the intake of the study diet. Categorical
data were analysed with a chi-square test. Finally, a two-tailed Spearman’s test was employed for
correlation analysis. A p-value below 0.05 was considered significant. Data are presented as mean ±
standard deviation or the number of patients and percentage.
2.3. Procedure
Once the sample was obtained, the volunteers and their families received detailed information
on the study. They were also given instructions to not change their lifestyle habits throughout the
4 months of the duration of the study. They were provided with information on the characteristics of
a ketogenic diet and their obligation to follow it over the 4-month period. Once these requirements
were accepted, the participants signed an informed consent form. In order to verify that the patients
complied with the treatment, weekly telephone calls were made in which they were asked about any
doubts and problems in following the diet.

2.4. Intervention
Once each participant had been assessed, a ketogenic diet was designed by using the
nutritional-dietary software “Nutrition and Health” version 2.0® (University of Granada, Granada,
Spain). This diet was given for a 4-month period and was adapted to the individual characteristics of
each participant. It consisted of an isocaloric diet with 5 meals a day: breakfast, mid-morning snack,
lunch, afternoon snack and dinner. The percentage distribution of the 3 main macronutrients with
respect to the total caloric value of the diet was as follows: 20% proteins, 40% carbohydrates and
40% lipids. The diet was based on promoting healthy food and avoiding ultra-processed products.
Thus, foods with a high content of rapidly-digested simple sugars (dairy desserts, juices, chocolate bars
and soft drinks), unhealthy fats (cold meats and pastries) and with a high level of salt and additives
(snacks) were avoided. In addition, the consumption of alcohol, both fermented and distilled, was
not considered. Foods rich in proteins of a high biological value of animal origin were included,
such as lean meat, white and oily fish, eggs, seafood and dairy and healthy derivatives (yoghurt and
cheese). Proteins of vegetable origin cooked in a healthy way and roasted or raw nuts without salt
were also included. In order to guarantee sufficient vitamins, minerals and fibre, the consumption
of low glycaemic vegetables and fruits and slowly-digested complex carbohydrates were included,
preferably a wholemeal whenever possible (rice, pasta, legumes, tubers) and cooked in a healthy way.
Regarding the diet’s lipid panel, which corresponds to 20% of the total caloric value, it was
distributed as follows: 65.69% saturated fatty acids, 19.64% monounsaturated fatty acids and 14.77%
polyunsaturated fatty acids. In addition, the diet provided a total daily amount of 232.41 mg of
cholesterol and 38.74 g of fibre. Finally, with the aim of achieving a ketogenic state, a total of 60 mL
of coconut oil was provided on a daily basis (30 mL of coconut oil for breakfast and 30 mL for
lunch). The lipid panel of the 60 mL of coconut oil was as follows: 91.84% saturated fatty acids, 6.23%
monounsaturated fatty acids and 1.93% de polyunsaturated fatty acids. This fatty acid intake was
included in the isocaloric diet and was adapted to an adult’s nutritional requirements.
2.5. Measurements
The following measurements were taken before and after the 4-month intervention, in the same
conditions and by the same researcher assigned to the study.
•
Nutritional and dietary anamnesis: Just before starting the study, a nutritional and dietary
anamnesis was carried out for each patient with the Food Frequency Questionnaire (FFQ) [44].
This tool made it possible to determine how often foods belonging to different groups were
consumed: dairy products, vegetables, fruits, juices, nuts, meat, fish, seafood, eggs, tubers, rice,
legumes, pasta, cold meats and sausages, snacks, pastries and biscuits, chocolate bars, soft drinks,
fermented alcohol and distilled alcohol.
•
Body composition: Measurements related to weight, height, skin folds and body perimeters and
diameters were taken using the Faulkner method, taking into account the protocol currently
established by The International Society for the Advancement of Kinanthropometry (ISAK).
Furthermore, we collaborated with an ISAK level 2 certified anthropometrist [45]. A portable
clinical scale, SECA model, with a 150–200 kg capacity and 100 g precision was used, a stadiometer,
model SECA 220 Hamburg, Germany with 0.1 cm precision, a mechanical skinfold caliper,
model Holtain LTD Crymych UK with a 0.2 mm precision and measurement range from 0 to
48 mm, a dermographic pencil, a metal, inextensible and narrow anthropometric tape, model
Lufkin W606PM with 0.2 mm precision and a bicondylar pachymeter to measure the diameter of
small bones, model Holtain, with 1 mm precision and measuring range from 0 to 48 mm.

•
Blood test and marker analysis: A blood test was carried out at 9 a.m. on an empty stomach,
then the serum was separated from the plasma after centrifuging the samples. The BHB levels
were measured with a commercial kit (Randox Laboratories, Crumlin, UK) and PON1 activity
by using 4-Nitrophenyl acetate [46]. In both cases, an automated clinical biochemistry analyser
(Olympus A 400, Tokyo, Japan) was used. Ghrelin was quantified by means of a commercial
method, ELISA kit (BioVendor, Asheville, NC, USA).
•
Appetite Assessment: Participants completed an appetite questionnaire for one whole day,
immediately before eating a meal and again after 2 h (breakfast, lunch and dinner). The appetite
questionnaire used a visual analogue scale (VAS), which has been found to be a reliable and valid
tool for appetite assessment [47]. This questionnaire included eight questions followed by 10 cm
horizontal lines, where 0 represented “sensation not felt at all” and 10 represented “sensation
strongly felt”. Subjects were asked to mark the line at the point which corresponded to how they
were feeling at that particular time. The questionnaire was developed by Parker et al. [48] to
assess human appetite. The distance from the beginning of the line to the participants’ mark was
measured from the left-hand side.
2.6. Ethical Concerns
The study was developed in accordance with the Declaration of Helsinki [49] with the prior
approval of the protocol by the University of Valencia Human Research Committee of the Experimental
Research Ethics Committee (procedure number H1512345043343). Participants were provided with
written informed consent, after being informed of the nature of the study, as well as all the procedures
to which they would be subjected in it.
3. Results
This study analysed a sample of 27 MS patients with a comparable proportion of patients of the
different types of MS accepted at present and a mean age of 44.56 years (Table 1).

3.1. Dietary Habits of the Study Population
According to this study’s data, the study population’s dietary habits before the intervention were
based on a high intake of simple sugars (dairy desserts, juices, pastries, chocolate bars and soft drinks)
and a low intake of refined complex carbohydrates (rice and pasta). In addition, fruit and vegetable
intake was low, therefore providing little fibre to their diet. Regarding fats, they mainly originated
from cold meats, pastries, chocolate bars and snacks. Their diets were not rich in proteins (Table 2).

4. Discussion 
Due to pathogenesis based mainly on energy alteration at a mitochondrial level, patients with 
MS express a worsening of physical function [4,50], decreasing their muscle mass [51]. An 
alternative treatment is to restore this mitochondrial activity. For this reason, our study prescribed a 
ketogenic diet for 4 months. According to literature, this is the first study to address the possible

4. Discussion
Due to pathogenesis based mainly on energy alteration at a mitochondrial level, patients with
MS express a worsening of physical function [4,50], decreasing their muscle mass [51]. An alternative
treatment is to restore this mitochondrial activity. For this reason, our study prescribed a ketogenic
diet for 4 months. According to literature, this is the first study to address the possible improvements
in body composition, oxidation state and metabolism in MS patients, based on the satiating effect of a
Mediterranean isocaloric diet rich in fats with a high MCT content.
In general, our results coincide with those of other studies, which indicate that ketone bodies can
be a good alternative to improve motor function, not only as a result of their neuroprotective properties
analysed by other authors [9–11] but also due to the metabolic impact based mainly on the satiating
effect related to weight loss with an increase in lean mass [25,26]. In particular, there was a significant
increase in BHB in serum after our intervention, alongside an increase in lean mass and a decrease in
fat mass, which in both cases were significant. In addition, possibly as a result of an anthropometric
profile change, there was a significant increase in PON1 levels, a marker associated with low levels of
oxidative stress and inflammation. This could be due to an improvement in the total antioxidant status
in the blood, already evidenced especially after intake of certain nutrients, such as fruit and vegetables,
present in large quantities in the Mediterranean diet, and precisely by promoting higher production of
PON1 in the liver [52]. In this sense, the ketogenesis induced in our study has a Mediterranean diet
base. This fact could increase the antioxidant activity, which has already been observed after only a
three-week ketogenic diet [53,54]. The changes obtained in our study after a four-month intervention
imply a variation in the organism’s preference for ketones as a fuel (especially BHB). This was already
observed a few weeks after prescribing a ketogenic diet [55,56].
As previously mentioned, the satiating effect of ketone bodies [19,20] could have a relevant role
in improving the aforementioned anthropometric improvements. In this sense, and as indicated in
previous research [19,20], this study showed a significant increase in satiety. In addition, this effect also
saw a lower hunger perception. Nonetheless, ghrelin, the hormone directly related to hunger [57],
maintained levels similar to those that patients had before starting the intervention. This discrepancy
could be due to the relationship between BHB secretion and the hormone. In accordance with
our results, another study [58] showed how ghrelin levels do not vary in the blood if ketone body
administration is in the long term, specifically 8 weeks, despite a decrease in weight and increase of
BHB. Something similar could be observed when a low carbohydrate ketogenic diet was prescribed for
12 weeks, as there were no variations in ghrelin when fasting, although there was weight loss [59].
After our intervention, changes in satiety and hunger were before and after lunch and dinner.
This was not the case with breakfast. The explanation of these results could be based on the hypothesis
that the production of both molecules is related in the short term, and during the day, depends on
meals. Recently, a significant decrease in ghrelin in the blood has been shown between 2 and 4 h
after timely drinking a ketone ester drink, with a peak increase of BHB in the blood after 60 min.
This was also associated with an immediate decrease in appetite and the desire to eat after this period
of time [39]. In our study, although the levels of ketone bodies and ghrelin were not measured in
the different meals to avoid adding stress to the individuals involved in the study, we could say that,
based on the aforementioned, due to the use of coconut oil at breakfast and lunch, the highest levels of
ketone bodies would be given at lunch and dinner. The same applied to the lowest levels of ghrelin.
Therefore, this would explain the feeling of satiety and lack of hunger before and after both meals.
In this sense, by not using coconut oil for dinner and after not eating for 8 h, the highest levels of ghrelin
in the blood would most likely be produced just before breakfast on an empty stomach. Regarding
BHB and its relation to the lack of satiety before and after breakfast, despite an increase in BHB after
treatment, it is possibly due to the organism adapting itself to use that source of energy [55,56] that
the impact on satiety does not occur before and after breakfast. The peaks after coconut oil intake at
breakfast and lunch caused satiety at lunch and dinner. Another aspect that could have an influence
on the differences in satiety and hunger observed, among the three main meals, are the changes in
 Nutrients 2019, 11, 1156

dietary habits and nutrients. Regarding dietary habits, patients mainly had four meals a day before
the study. However, patients had five meals a day during the intervention. This could have had an
influence on satiety and hunger, as smaller and more regular meals (five per day) are related to less
sudden changes in blood sugar and lipemia, as well as an improvement in regulating appetite and
satiety sensation [34,35].
In relation to food consumption, alterations in the glycaemic metabolism have been observed in
MS patients, related to damage at the mitochondrial level [60] and excessive production of ROS and
inflammation, helping to slow down the progression of the disease [61–63]. In addition, fast-digesting
simple sugars in the short- and long-term favour appetite and increase intake [32,33], as a rise in
insulin leads to an increase in hunger and a decrease in satiety [64] related to a rise in the glycaemic
index [65,66]. As a result, this study performed a nutritional change, going from consuming a high
intake of carbohydrates, mainly simple sugars, to consuming complex carbohydrates and healthy
fats. This would regulate the glycaemic index and, as a result, decrease hunger and increase satiety
throughout the day [67,68]. Furthermore, a larger amount of fibre in the diet, in relation to the diet before
the study, would favour the regulation of glucose levels and the satiating effect [30], thus explaining
the obtained results. Finally, our intervention also included a higher amount of protein than previously
consumed and balanced with respect to the other nutrients, which could also contribute to decreasing
hunger and increasing satiety [69,70]. In short, comparing the effects of the ketogenic diet on the
different organs described in the introduction (Figure 2A), our results after the discussion suggest the
contributions that can be seen in Figure 2B.
Despite the fact that our results show evidence of improvement related to the disease and the
production of markers related to the perception of satiety and hunger after prescribing a ketogenic
diet, the study has a series of limitations. Among such limitations, in addition to a small sample
leading to relatively high standard deviations, BHB and ghrelin measurements were not taken during
the day. Therefore, future research should include a larger sample. Furthermore, BHB and ghrelin
should be measured during the day, in order to better understand the interaction between the variation
levels with the perception of satiety and hunger. Finally, it is necessary to study further the behaviour
and role of other molecules and parameters directly related to hunger and satiety, highlighting the
glycaemic index.

In addition, the increased perception of satiety during lunch and dinner raises the possibility that this
increase will be greater in these temporal intervals (2:00 p.m and 9.30 p.m) depending on the time of
administration of coconut oil. Regarding ghrelin, fasting levels are maintained as before the start of the
intervention. However, depending on the interaction with the production of ketonic bodies already
described, the production could decrease coinciding with the increase of BHB (2:00 p.m and 9.30 p.m).
These two associated processes may explain the increase in muscle and the decrease in fat. Both aspects
would be related to a better metabolic profile, evidenced by the higher production of PON1 in the liver
as an anti-inflammatory marker.

5. Conclusions
After the intervention with MS patients had taken place, an increase in lean mass was observed,
alongside fat mass loss. These changes could be related to patients’ metabolic profile improvements,
evidenced by an increase in PON levels associated with less oxidation and inflammation. Furthermore,
a satiating effect was found, alongside a lower feeling of hunger, at lunch and dinner, which could
be associated with an increase in BHB levels and changes in dietary habits. These results indicate
that obtaining ketogenesis by consuming a Mediterranean diet rich in MCT fats produces a satiating
effect, possibly related to metabolic and anthropometric changes that have a positive impact on the
clinical evolution of MS. Consequently, this type of diet may represent a therapeutic alternative by
supplementing the pharmacological treatment. However, new studies would be required to confirm
the conclusions drawn and the mechanisms proposed.
