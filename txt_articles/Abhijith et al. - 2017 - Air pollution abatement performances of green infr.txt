Intensifying the proportion of urban green infrastructure has been considered as one of the remedies for
air pollution levels in cities, yet the impact of numerous vegetation types deployed in different built
environments has to be fully synthesised and quantified. This review examined published literature on
neighbourhood air quality modifications by green interventions. Studies were evaluated that discussed
personal exposure to local sources of air pollution under the presence of vegetation in open road and
built-up street canyon environments. Further, we critically evaluated the available literature to provide a
better understanding of the interactions between vegetation and surrounding built-up environments
and ascertain means of reducing local air pollution exposure using green infrastructure. The net effects of
vegetation in each built-up environment are also summarised and possible recommendations for the
future design of green infrastructure are proposed. In a street canyon environment, high-level vegetation

canopies (trees) led to a deterioration in air quality, while low-level green infrastructure (hedges)
improved air quality conditions. For open road conditions, wide, low porosity and tall vegetation leads to
downwind pollutant reductions while gaps and high porosity vegetation could lead to no improvement
or even deteriorated air quality. The review considers that generic recommendations can be provided for
vegetation barriers in open road conditions. Green walls and roofs on building envelopes can also be used
as effective air pollution abatement measures. The critical evaluation of the fundamental concepts and
the amalgamation of key technical features of past studies by this review could assist urban planners to
design and implement green infrastructures in the built environment.

1. Introduction
Air quality in the built environment continues to be a primary
health concern as the majority (i.e., 54% in 2014) of the world's
population currently lives in urban areas, and this is projected to
rise to 66% by 2050 (United Nations, 2014). Traffic emissions are the
main source of air pollution in cities around the globe (Kumar et al.,
2016, 2015, 2013). Green infrastructure in the built environment
has been considered as one potential urban planning solution for
improving air quality as well as enhancing the sustainability of
cities for growing urban populations (Irga et al., 2015; Salmond
et al., 2016). These green solutions include street trees, vegetation
barriers (including hedges), green (or living) walls, and green (or
living) roofs. These types of vegetation act as porous bodies which
influence local dispersion patterns, and aid the deposition and
removal of airborne pollutants (Escobedo and Nowak, 2009;
Fantozzi et al., 2015; Janhall, 2015; Nowak, 2006; Yin et al., 2011).
Apart from possible air pollution reduction, urban green infra-
structure also provides benefits such as urban heat island mitiga-
tion (Chen et al., 2014; Gago et al., 2013), potential reduction in
energy consumption (Berardi et al., 2014; P�
erez et al., 2014) and
noise pollution (Berardi et al., 2014; Cohen et al., 2014; Salmond
et
al.,
2016),
better
stormwater
management
(Czemiel
Berndtsson, 2010; Roy et al., 2012) and climate change mitigation
(Matthews et al., 2015). In addition, eco-services provided by green
interventions assist in improving the health and well-being of the
urban population in several ways (Dean et al., 2011; Nowak et al.,
2014; Tzoulas et al., 2007).
Road traffic emits a variety of harmful pollutants in the form of
particulate matter e PM10 (particulate matter �10 mm), PM2.5
(�2.5 mm) and ultrafine particles (UFP; <100 nm) e and gaseous
pollutants such as the nitrogen oxides (NOx), carbon monoxide (CO)
and in minor part sulphur dioxide (SO2). As for the air pollution
abatement performance of various types of green infrastructure,
either individually or in combination, in different urban environ-
ments (Gallagher et al., 2015), the majority of studies have focused
on pollutants such as the PM10 (Heal et al., 2012; Maleki et al.,
2016), PM2.5 (Ayubi and Safiri, 2017; Heal et al., 2012), UFP (Chen
et al., 2016; Kumar et al., 2014), NOx (Beevers et al., 2012;
Michiels et al., 2012), CO (Bigazzi and Figliozzi, 2015; Chen et al.,
2011), and black carbon (Li et al., 2016a; Rivas et al., 2017a,b) that
have implications for the adverse health effects. In future, urban
green infrastructure can be implemented as a passive air pollution
control measure in cities through limited alterations in the built
environment (McNabola, 2010). The urban environments accoun-
ted for in the studies reviewed here were either near an open road
or in an urban street canyon with high traffic volumes. For example,
the impact of trees in street canyons were examined by numerous
studies (Abhijith and Gokhale, 2015; Amorim et al., 2013; Buccolieri
et al., 2011, 2009; Gromke et al., 2008; Gromke and Ruck, 2007;
Hofman et al., 2016; Li et al., 2013; Moonen et al., 2013; Salim
et al., 2011a; Salmond et al., 2013; Vos et al., 2013; Wania et al.,
2012: Jeanjean et al., 2017). These studies generally indicated that
the presence of trees increases the pollution concentration in a
street canyon. Other studies investigated pollutant exposure in
street canyons with hedges and reported that low-level hedgerows
generally reduces pollutant levels along the footpath (Gromke
et al., 2016; Li et al., 2016b). Likewise, a few studies investigated
the air pollution removal potential of vegetation along busy urban
highways, reporting that vegetation barriers and trees along roads
reduced roadside pollutant concentrations (Brantley et al., 2014;
Hagler et al., 2012; Lin et al., 2016; Tong et al., 2016). A few
studies also indicated that roadside vegetation can have adverse
effects on air quality under certain conditions (Tong et al., 2015).
Recently, Baldauf (2017) summarised the vegetation characteristics
that influence the beneficial and adverse effects of roadside vege-
tation on near-road air quality. A number of past studies also
examined the air pollution removal potential of green roofs and
green walls (Joshi and Ghosh, 2014; Ottel�
e et al., 2010; Pugh et al.,
2012) or the combinations of green infrastructure with other pas-
sive pollution control methods (Baldauf et al., 2008; Bowker et al.,
2007; Tong et al., 2016; Baik et al., 2012; Tan and Sia, 2005). Overall,
a general conclusion from these studies was that green infra-
structure had both positive and negative impacts on air quality at
street
levels,
depending
on
the
urban
and
vegetation
characteristics.
As summarised in Table 1, previous review articles on this topic
have discussed particulate matter (PM) removal by vegetation
(Janhall, 2015), the suitability of passive methods to reduce
pollutant exposure (Gallagher et al., 2015), vegetation design
characteristics for roadside applications (Baldauf, 2017, 2016;
Baldauf et al., 2013) and pollutant deposition on plant canopies
(Litschike and Kuttler, 2008; Petroff et al., 2008). Furthermore,
previous reviews have focused on the benefits of urban infra-
structure such as urban heat island mitigation from trees (Gago
et al., 2013), thermal performance of green facades (Hunter et al.,
2014) and energy aspects of green roofs (Saadatian et al., 2013).
Recently, Berardi et al. (2014) published a state-of-the-art review
on air pollution mitigation by green roofs. However, there is still a
need to systematically review and summarise the individual find-
ings of various published research studies on numerous types of
green infrastructure that consider local air quality improvements in
the diverse urban environment. Going beyond the scope of existing
reviews on this topic, this article: (i) provides a detailed quantifi-
cation of local scale aerodynamic effects and reduction potentials of
urban vegetation such as trees, hedges, green wall and green roofs
in both built-up (street canyon) and open road configurations, (ii)
describes the individual and combined effects of the built envi-
ronment, metrological and vegetation characteristics on neigh-

 interventions in diverse urban environments.
This synthesis of local scale air quality impacts for each vege-
tation type is essential for city level implementation that uses a
bottom-up decision-making process. This ensures the success of
these interventions irrespective of scales (Salmond et al., 2016).
Therefore, it is necessary to consolidate and synthesise previous
investigations on the air pollution abatement performance of urban
green infrastructure (i) for urban planners to facilitate its practical
application in future urban planning strategies and (ii) for re-
searchers to identify gaps in knowledge and to undertake further
evaluation and validation of the performance of green infrastruc-
ture
to
improve
urban
air
quality
and
ameliorate
urban
microclimate.
Further, this review aims to develop generic recommendations
on the selection and design characteristics of suitable green infra-
structure in different urban environments. These recommenda-
tions can then be deployed in the future for existing city
environments to reduce pollutant exposure from nearby emission
sources at the local scale. We categorised the vegetation impacts on
neighbourhood air quality based on different urban forms such as
street canyons (Fig. 1), open roads (Fig. 2) and building envelopes
(Fig. 1d), and observed the distinct impacts of vegetation on air
quality with respect to urban morphology. This revealed site-
specific recommendations suitable for planting vegetation in
street canyons as well as forming generic guidelines for open road
configurations. In addition, the review provides insights into the
least studied vegetation application (i.e. green walls and roofs) and
highlights existing research gaps. A comprehensive summary of
technical design inputs (e.g., leaf area density, LAD; deposition
velocity; porosity) for four different types of vegetation are also
compiled to assist any potential dispersion and deposition model-
ling activities. Altogether, the flow of the scientific knowledge
consolidated in this review will aid in the practical usage of green
interventions in the real-world cases for a healthier environment.
2. Common characteristics of urban vegetation (green
infrastructure)
The terms ‘urban vegetation’ and ‘green infrastructure’ are used
interchangeably in this review paper and refer to all types of
vegetation such as trees (Section 3.1), hedges and bushes (Section
3.2), green walls (Section 5.1) and green roofs (Section 5.2) that are
the focus of this article. Before examining individual urban built
environment conditions (Sections 3 and 4), it is important to un-
derstand the common vegetation characteristics that affect near-
road
air
quality.
These
characteristics
include:
(i)
pollutant
removal and dispersion characteristics, (ii) density/porosity of
vegetation, (iii) physical dimensions (such as height, length,
thickness and spacing), and (iv) species-specific characteristics
(such as leaf thickness, presence of hairs or wax on leaf surface,
seasonal variations, vegetation emissions and air pollution toler-
ance index).
Urban vegetation removes gaseous pollutants by absorption
through leaf stomata or plant surfaces (Escobedo and Nowak, 2009;
Fantozzi et al., 2015; Salmond et al., 2016; Vesa Yli-Pelkonen et al.,
2017). Nowak et al. (2013, 2006) investigated pollution removal for
several gases (O3, NO2, SO2, CO) and PM10 by measuring the
downward pollutant flux as the product of the deposition velocity
and the pollutant concentration. They found that pollution removal
values for each pollutant vary among cities based on the amount of
tree cover, pollution concentration, the length of in leaf season, the
amount of precipitation and other meteorological variables that
affect tree transpiration and deposition velocities. Furthermore, PM
deposited on vegetation can be retained for some time temporarily
and then re-suspend to the atmosphere by high wind speed,
washed off by precipitation, or transferred to soil with falling parts
of vegetation including leaves (Nowak et al., 2014). Some vegeta-
tion species act as a pollutant source by emitting pollen (D'Amato
et al., 2007) and some gaseous pollutants (Benjamin and Winer,
1998; Leung et al., 2011; Wagner and Kuttler, 2014). A porous
body of vegetation can influence nearby pollutant concentrations
by altering the wind flow around it (Ries and Eichhorn, 2001). The
aerodynamic effects of trees affect pollutant concentration in two
ways depending on the built-up environment and meteorological
conditions. Under neutral thermal stratification (i.e. a typical con-
dition reproduced in laboratory studies), tree crowns act as ob-
stacles to the wind and depending on the shape and spatial
configuration, they diminish the turbulent exchange of mass and
momentum between the in-canopy volume and the air above the
canopy. On the other hand, tree crowns may generate wind

 direction fluctuations below the tree crown (Di Sabatino et al.,
2015), and depending on foliage shape and distribution, these act
as a source of turbulence and hence increase turbulent diffusion
and facilitate pollutant dilution. The aerodynamics effects of trees
have been addressed extensively by several authors using wind
tunnel investigations complemented by detailed CFD modelling.
Also, the effect of the role of non-neutral thermal stratification has
been addressed in both computational and observational studies.
For example, De Maerschalck et al. (2010) showed that in specific
meteorological conditions or geometries of built environment,
vegetation can decrease turbulent kinetic energy and act as a
diffuser breaking down the turbulent eddies. Based on real-
atmospheric observations in street canyons, Di Sabatino et al.
(2015) showed that the presence of trees alters the thermal verti-
cal distribution inside street canyons, especially in nocturnal hours,
with the bottom layer much warmer than the top of the canyon, but
with a remarkable decoupling of the flow and diminished vertical
exchange. In synthesis, there is a consensus that an increase in
pollutant concentrations in street canyons occur with the presence
of trees (Buccolieri et al., 2009; Gromke and Ruck, 2009, 2007).
However, a reduction in pollution concentrations may occur
depending on micrometeorological conditions and type of foliage;
this is especially true due to the presence of hedges in street can-
yons and dense vegetation along highways (Al-Dabbous and
Kumar, 2014; Brantley et al., 2014; Gromke et al., 2016). Critical in
interpreting these findings is that vegetation can both introduce
extra mechanical turbulence, but also reduce turbulent kinetic
energy, while the strong wind speed reduction around the vege-
tation causes strong shear stresses and therefore extra turbulence.
Nevertheless, the combination of local meteorological conditions
and vegetation has received less attention and extra research ef-
forts may be foreseen in future years.
The nature of vegetation effects are dominated by the geometry
of the built-up environment. In street canyons, trees may deterio-
rate air quality if their configuration is not planned adequately
(Abhijith and Gokhale, 2015; Buccolieri et al., 2011; Ries and
Eichhorn, 2001; Salmond et al., 2013; Vos et al., 2013; Wania
et al., 2012) whereas in open road environments a mixture of
trees and bushes can act as barriers to improving air quality behind
them (Brantley et al., 2014; Hagler et al., 2012; Islam et al., 2012; Lin
et al., 2016; Shan et al., 2007). These dispersion and deposition
characteristics are affected by the density and area of the vegeta-
tion with the deposition rate due to vegetation being estimated by
two methods: the leaf area index (LAI) that is defined as the amount
of vegetation surface area per m2 of ground area, or leaf area
density (LAD) that is defined as the total one-sided leaf area per
unit volume of canopy layer (m2 m�3 or m2 m�1). The porosity,

 pressure drop or drag force can be estimated by studying pollutant
dispersion around vegetation. Janhall (2015) provided a detailed
explanation on PM dispersion and deposition caused by vegetation.
Previous studies have employed different methods to quantify the
density of vegetation. Low porosity (high-density) vegetation had a
similar effect to solid barriers such as low boundary walls
(Gallagher et al., 2012; Gromke et al., 2016; Janhall, 2015; McNabola
et al., 2009), which forces the air to flow above and over it, while
high porosity (low-density) vegetation allows air to pass through it.
The porosity and drag force changes with wind velocity (Gromke
and Ruck, 2008; Tiwary et al., 2005). During the high wind speed
conditions, a decrease in porosity of broad-leafed trees and drag
force on trees were observed by Gromke and Ruck (2008) and
Tiwary et al. (2005), respectively. On the other hand, an increase in
porosity was noted in conifers and no change in porosity up to a
particular threshold value of wind speed (i.e. 0.8e1.7 ms �1) was
shown by hedges (Tiwary et al., 2005).
Vegetation parameters have contrasting impacts on local air
quality with respect to the surrounding urban geometry. In general,
vegetation with gaps and spacing lead to lower concentrations in
street canyons as opposed to an increased concentration in open
road conditions. Dense (low porosity) vegetation can usually lead to
concentration reductions in street canyons. Vegetation species with
thick leaves show less deposition as opposed to those with hairs
and or waxes (Sæbø et al., 2012). Likewise, urban vegetation with
less seasonal variations (i.e. no change in foliage) and lower
pollutant (biogenic compounds) emission are preferred. A study by
Pandey et al. (2015) suggests an evaluation of air pollution toler-
ance index of vegetation before planting them in an urban area. In
conclusion, the aforementioned vegetation characteristics were
covered as a part of this review during the evaluation of vegetation
impacts on air quality in different urban built environments.
3. Effect of green infrastructure on air quality in street
canyons
Street canyons are a commonly found urban feature and typi-
cally consists of buildings along both sides of the road (Kumar et al.,
2011; Vardoulakis et al., 2003). Vegetation planted in street canyons
are typically part of urban landscaping strategies and are periodi-
cally maintained by landscape professionals employed within or on
behalf of the local authorities. Green infrastructure in the urban
street canyon can be classified as trees and hedges and specific
details for both types are discussed in Sections 3.1 and 3.2,
respectively.
3.1. Trees in street canyons
Trees are widely employed as an environmental tool to improve
urban outdoor climate and are planted and/or managed as part of
the urban landscaping in streets, parks, and other common acces-
sible spaces. This section focuses on the impact of tree design
characteristics on air quality based on their proximity to traffic
emissions sources in a street canyon. There are many examples of
trees being placed along the two sides of the street, an avenue style
of planting or a single tree stand in the middle (Hofman et al., 2016;
Kikuchi et al., 2007; Li et al., 2013). The spacing between trees
varies and the physical dimensions change with species (Amorim
et al., 2013; Kikuchi et al., 2007). The tree canopy is elevated from
ground surface creating a clear area about one or 2 m and thus it is
referred as high-level vegetation. On the other hand, hedges and
bushes are mentioned as low-level vegetation as these have
continuous leaf covering from the ground surface to top. It has been
observed that trees can have an adverse effect on air quality within
the street canyon (Gromke et al., 2008; Gromke and Ruck, 2007;
Salmond et al., 2013; Vos et al., 2013). Trees can reduce the wind
speed in a street canyon, resulting in reduced air exchange between
the air above the roof and within the canyon and hence leading to
accumulation of pollutants inside the street canyon (Buccolieri
et al., 2015, 2009; Gromke et al., 2008; Gromke and Ruck, 2007;
Kumar et al., 2008, 2009; Jeanjean et al., 2017). Thus, pollutant
concentrations in a street canyon with trees show higher concen-
trations compared with those without trees. Apart from common
vegetation characteristics listed in Section 2, the other unique
factors of street canyon and trees that affect pollutant exposure are
aspect ratio, wind direction and speed, spacing between trees,
distance from pollutant source to trees and the sectional area
occupied by trees of the street canyon (Abhijith and Gokhale, 2015;
Amorim et al., 2013; Buccolieri et al., 2011; Gromke and Ruck, 2012;
Jin et al., 2014; Salmond et al., 2013; Vos et al., 2013). In addition,
previous research have introduced parameters such as street tree
canopy density (CD) that is defined as the ratio of the projected
ground area of tree crowns to the street canyon ground area (Jin
et al., 2014), and crown volume fraction (CVF) that is defined as
the volume occupied by tree crowns within a street canyon section
(Gromke and Blocken, 2015). Key flow patterns and pollutant
dispersion in street canyon with and without various vegetation are
shown in Fig. 1.
A limited number of field measurement based studies have
assessed pollutant exposure in street canyons having trees inside
them (Hofman et al., 2016, 2014, 2013; Hofman and Samson, 2014;
Jin et al., 2014; Kikuchi et al., 2007; Salmond et al., 2013). Another
strand of studies evaluated the impacts of trees on street level
pollutant exposure through combined measurement and model-
ling studies (Amorim et al., 2013; Buccolieri et al., 2011; Hofman
et al., 2016). These studies measured air pollutants at one or
more locations in street canyons, which were then used for vali-
dating the model so that the validated model could yield concen-
tration profiles inside the study area. These validated models also
allow ‘scenario analysis’ by choosing desired locations and vege-
tation parameters for identifying the least pollution exposure sce-
nario in the study area. As an effective tool, laboratory experiments
in a wind tunnel (Gromke and Ruck, 2012, 2009, 2007) as well as
dispersion and deposition modelling studies have extensively
evaluated pedestrian pollutant exposure to local emissions sources
in street canyons with trees (Balcz�
o et al., 2009; Buccolieri et al.,
2011, 2009; Gromke et al., 2008; Gromke and Blocken, 2015; Li
et al., 2013; Moradpour et al., 2016; Ng and Chau, 2012; Ries and
Eichhorn, 2001; Salim et al., 2011a, 2011b; Vos et al., 2013;
Vranckx et al., 2015; Wania et al., 2012; Jeanjean et al., 2017). A
comprehensive summary of these studies are provided in Supple-
mentary Information, SI, Table S1 and detailed technical detail with
key finding are tabulated in SI Table S2.
3.1.1. Effect of wind flow conditions
In general, all the studies summarised in Table 2 and depicted in
Fig. 3 reported reduction in wind velocities within the street can-
yons and an increase in pollutant concentration in street canyons
with trees than without the trees (Amorim et al., 2013; Buccolieri
et al., 2011; Gromke and Ruck, 2012; Hofman et al., 2016; Jin
et al., 2014; Kikuchi et al., 2007; Ries and Eichhorn, 2001;
Salmond et al., 2013; Vranckx et al., 2015; Jeanjean et al., 2017).
The majority of studies reported an average increase of 20e96% in
concentrations of different pollutants due to the presence of trees
in street canyons compared with those without the trees (Fig. 3).
The presence of trees in street canyon led to reduced pollutant
concentrations with an increase in wind velocity under different
wind directions (Hofman and Samson, 2014; Wania et al., 2012).
Typically, three main wind directions e perpendicular (90�), par-
allel (aligned, 0�) or oblique (45�) e were investigated in street

 canyon studies with respect to those without the trees. The studies
on an isolated street canyon with trees reported higher and lower
concentrations along the leeward and windward side of the canyon,
respectively, under the perpendicular flow. Under oblique wind and
parallel flow conditions, an increase in pollutant levels on both
sides was reported along with increasing pollutant concentrations
towards the outer end of the canyon (Abhijith and Gokhale, 2015;
Buccolieri et al., 2011; Gromke and Ruck, 2012; Wania et al.,
2012). Of the three wind directions studied, perpendicular flow is
the most commonly investigated (Fig. 3). An oblique wind direction
was identified as the worst scenario, resulting in an accumulation
of pollutants on both sides of the canyon (Abhijith and Gokhale,
2015; Buccolieri et al., 2011; Gromke and Ruck, 2012).
Some studies also reported conflicting results for pollution
distribution in the street canyons. For example, the parallel wind
flow showed up to 16% improvement compared to the tree-free
scenario, Table 2 (Amorim et al., 2013). Similarly, Jeanjean et al.
(2017) observed reduction in pollutant concentration under
parallel wind direction. The larger concentrations measured
during parallel winds (with respect to the street canyon axis)
were due to the channelling effect of pollutants emitted from an
intense traffic corridor at the end of the canyon, while lower
concentrations under perpendicular winds occurred due to the
blockage of polluted air masses entering the street canyon
(Hofman and Samson, 2014). Larger concentration changes were
observed in street canyons that were aligned with the wind di-
rection than street canyon with perpendicular wind direction
(Gromke and Blocken, 2015). Furthermore, the detailed per-
centage change in pollutant concentration under various aspect
ratio and wind direction of all studies considered in this review
are given in Fig. 3. These variations account for local conditions,
which have a significant impact on pollutant distribution within
the street canyon.
3.1.2. Effect of aspect ratio and vegetation characteristics
There is a complex relationship between aspect ratios of street
canyons and vegetation characteristics. The aspect ratio signifi-
cantly affects pollutant dispersion because of alterations in air flow
patterns (Zhong et al., 2016). As detailed in Table 2, the ‘street
canyon’ investigated by past vegetation studies were mainly reg-
ular (0.5 < H/W < 2), deep (H/W � 2) or shallow (H/W � 0.5) as
classified by Vardoulakis et al. (2003). In a vegetation-free street
canyon, higher pollutant concentrations were observed for large
aspect ratios (Buccolieri et al., 2011; Ng and Chau, 2012); this is
mainly due to the reduced wind velocity and pollutant accumula-
tion in deep street canyons. In presence of trees with the same
density, higher NOx concentrations were measured in deep street
canyons (Moradpour et al., 2016) than shallow street canyons. The
simplest explanation, as reported in the several computational fluid
dynamics studies, is that the main mechanism of pollutant removal
in the regular street canyon is the primary vortex. In deep street
canyons, the primary vortex is split into two and hence makes them
less effective in removing in street pollutants with the clean air
above.
When considering vegetation characteristics, Janhall (2015)
remarked on the ambiguity in choosing LAD or porosity for
dispersion and/or deposition among published studies that makes
it challenging to directly compare results of various studies. Even
though past studies by Balcz�
o et al. (2009) and Gromke (2011) have
analysed the relationship between density parameters, there is a
need for standardisation in the selection of these parameters in
future studies, dealing with the deposition and dispersion. Studies
examining the impact of trees in street canyons have considered
LAD ranging from 0.2 to 5.12 m2 m-3 and porosities between 96%
and 99% as listed in Table 2. A number of studies noted an increase
in pollutant concentrations with an increase in LAD and decrease in
porosity due to pollutants accumulation inside the street canyons
(Abhijith and Gokhale, 2015; Balcz�
o et al., 2009; Buccolieri et al.,

2012).
While assessing the impact of aspect ratio and vegetation
characteristics
together,
the
past
studies
reported
increased
pollutant concentrations at street level due to a combined effect of
vegetation LAD, aspect ratio and wind direction (Buccolieri et al.,
2009; Moradpour et al., 2016). For example, Buccolieri et al.
(2011) observed that under perpendicular wind conditions, the
concentration increased in a regular street canyon with trees
compared with those in the tree-free shallow street canyon.
However, for an inclined wind direction, higher concentrations
were observed in the shallow street canyon with trees than those in
the tree-free regular street canyon. This abnormality was partially
clarified by Moradpour et al. (2016). They examined the combina-
tion of different vegetation densities and aspect ratios and deter-
mined the critical exposure conditions at the breathing height in a
street canyon. The denser vegetation resulted in worsening the air
quality. The larger regions of higher concentrations were observed
in street canyons that have aspect ratios of 0.5, 1.0 and 2.0 with
trees having LADs of 2.0, 1.5 and 1.0, respectively. Further studies
assessing the combinations of wind directions, aspect ratios and
LADs can provide a better understanding of the relationship be-
tween these variables.
Other important vegetation parameters are tree spacing, also
known as stand density, and the cross-sectional area covered by
them in street canyons. Increasing the spacing between tree crowns
and/or lowering their cross-sectional areas can decrease pollutant
concentrations in street canyons (Abhijith and Gokhale, 2015;
Buccolieri et al., 2009; Gromke and Ruck, 2007; Ng and Chau,
2012).
This
variation
in
pollutant
concentrations
with
tree
spacing was found to be predominant in shallow street canyons
than that in deeper canyons (Ng and Chau, 2012). Similarly, a nu-
merical investigation showed a slight increase (1%) in pollutant
concentration per unit percentage increase in CVF (Gromke and
Blocken, 2015).
Different kinds of trees such as deciduous and evergreen pro-
duced seasonal changes in pollutant exposure in street canyon.
During the summer seasons, pollutants were trapped in street
canyon with deciduous trees, however, in winter, higher pollutant
concentration was found in street canyon with evergreen trees (Jin
et al., 2014; Salmond et al., 2013). Non-foliated deciduous trees had
no effect on pollutant concentration during the winter season (Jin
et al., 2014; Salmond et al., 2013). Similar to seasonal variations,
Vranckx et al. (2015) simulated annual average changes in con-
centration in a shallow street canyon having trees under a variety of
wind directions in a street canyon in Antwerp (Belgium). This study
analysed deposition and dispersion of elemental carbon (EC) and
PM10 under different LADs, deposition speed (Vd) and drag co-
efficients (Cd). The reported annual average change ranged from 0.2
to 2.26% for PM10 and 1e13% for EC. The presences of trees caused a
lesser increase in PM10 concentrations in comparison to EC and NO2
(Vos et al., 2013), with the similar observation made for EC in a
study by Vranckx et al. (2015).
3.2. Hedges in street canyons
Hedges or hedgerows consist of shrubs and bushes which grow
less in size compared to trees and they are typically located at
ground level, therefore typically representing the closest type of
green infrastructure that exists to local emissions sources in an
urban street canyon. Therefore, their performance for improving air
quality is dominated by its ability to remove local sources of
emissions and this is reflected in the results. They are usually
planted along boundaries to serve as fencing or a living boundary
wall. The shape of the hedgerows is commonly well maintained to a
cuboidal or the other definite shapes (such as cuboidal bottom and
spherical top) in the heavily built-up areas. Whereas, these may be
allowed to grow with less pruning and maintenance along the sides
of major highways. These low-level vegetation are usually a
mixture of shrubs and other small vegetation. Hedges have
comparatively less height and thickness than trees but possess
higher leaf density.
Similar to trees in street canyons, hedges are planted along the
streets in various configurations. Only a few studies examined the
air pollution reduction potential of hedges in street canyon (Chen
et al., 2015; Gromke et al., 2016; Li et al., 2016b; Vos et al., 2013;
Wania et al., 2012). Key findings are provided in Table 3 and
further detailed summaries are documented in SI Table S4. Three of
these studies observed that hedges reduced pollutant exposure by
24e61% at the footpath areas in street canyons (Fig. 3). However,
Vos et al. (2013) reported an increase in pollutant concentration
with the presence of hedges in street canyons. Although, the study
stated that it mainly focused on the general trend in pollutant
concentrations with multiple vegetation scenarios in a built-up

 environment. Hence, the above observation should be generalised
cautiously by considering them as an outcome of an individual
scenario.
Matching to the effect of trees on wind velocity in street can-
yons, hedges were found to reduce wind velocity with-in street
canyon (Gromke et al., 2016; Li et al., 2016a, 2016b; Wania et al.,
2012) but the effects on the wind velocity were lesser than trees
(Wania et al., 2012). Hedges diverted air pollutant from reaching
footpath area by generating local vortices (Gromke et al., 2016; Li
et al., 2016b). Low permeable and higher (2.5 m) hedges showed
more pollutant reduction at the footpath area. While a central
single hedgerow (in the middle of the street canyon) showed
maximum concentration reduction in street canyon compared to
hedgerows along both sides of roads (Gromke et al., 2016). The
optimum height of a hedge was obtained through simulation by
assessing its sensitivity to wind velocity and aspect ratio of street
canyons (Li et al., 2016b). This resulted in an optimum height be-
tween 1 and 2 m in both shallow as well as regular street canyons.
Maximum pollutant reduction occurred at breathing height along
the foot path of two shallow street canyons (H/W ¼ 0.18 and 0.4)
with a hedge of 2 m height. Likewise, maximum pollutant reduc-
tion observed in the regular street canyon (H/W ¼ 0.78) with a
hedge of 1.1 m height. Gromke et al. (2016) observed a maximum
reduction in pollutant concentration in the shallow street canyon
with a hedge of 2.5 m height. The above studies suggest an opti-
mum height of hedges in shallow street canyons to be about 2 m
but further studies under different street aspect ratios are war-
ranted to generalise the hedge heights.
4. Effect of green infrastructure on air quality in open roads
An open road is an urban built environment feature in which
both sides of the traffic corridor are open with generally detached,
single or multi-story buildings and other manmade structures. In
open road conditions, trees as well as other vegetation such as
hedges, shrubs and bushes, are planted or occur naturally along one
or both sides of these corridors, and are referred to as ‘vegetation
barriers’ or ‘green belts’ (Brantley et al., 2014; Chen et al., 2015;
Islam et al., 2012; Morakinyo and Lam, 2016). These green belts
offer a number of additional benefits including heat island miti-
gation, water runoff control and for aesthetic purposes (Escobedo
et al., 2011). The role of vegetation barriers along open roads is
examined in more detail in subsequent sections.
4.1. Vegetation barriers
In open roads conditions, vegetation can act differently than in
street canyons. Nevertheless, rows of planted trees and other
vegetation types provide a barrier between the road and popula-
tion groups in adjacent residential areas, similar to that observed in
a street canyon environment. This barrier effect leads to an accu-
mulation of pollutant concentrations on the windward or upwind
side of the vegetation, for example as observed in front of a hedge
by Al-Dabbous and Kumar (2014). Vegetation barriers force
polluted air to flow either over or to pass through the vegetation,
and this is dependent upon porosity and physical dimensions (Tong
et al., 2016). Low density (high porosity) vegetation results in the
majority of air flowing through the barrier, whereas high density
(lower porosity) leads to little or no infiltration, similar to the
behaviour evident around solid barriers like low boundary walls
(Baldauf et al., 2008; Bowker et al., 2007; Brantley et al., 2014).
Downwind of vegetation barriers i.e. behind the vegetation, a wake
zone is created and pollutant concentrations decrease with
increasing distance from the road. The formation and extension of a
wake zone, pollutant concentration profile before and after vege-
tation, and pollutant deposition and dispersion within the barrier

 are controlled by wind direction and speed, position of vegetation,
physical characteristic of the green belt (such as thickness, height
and porosity), temperature, relative humidity, and the physical
characteristics of leafs (Baldauf, 2017). A graphical representation of
flow and pollutant dispersion patterns in open-road conditions are
depicted in Fig. 2. In addition to the vegetation parameters
described in the previous section, some studies considered shel-
terbelt porosity, which is the ratio of perforated area to the total
surface area exposed to the wind (Islam et al., 2012), and is defined
as the fraction of light that vertically penetrates tree cover for a
given section (Yin et al., 2011).
In contrast to street canyon investigations, most green infra-
structure studies examining pollution exposure in open road en-
vironments followed an experimental approach (Al-Dabbous and
Kumar, 2014; Brantley et al., 2014; Chen et al., 2015, 2016;
Fantozzi et al., 2015; Grundstr€
om and Pleijel, 2014; Hagler et al.,
2012; Islam et al., 2012; Lin et al., 2016; Shan et al., 2007; Tiwary
et al., 2008; Tong et al., 2016, 2015). In these cases, the source of
emissions is predominantly linked to the adjacent roadway. How-
ever, in comparison to an urban street canyon environment, the
contribution of background concentrations represent a lesser
fraction of localised air pollution in these scenarios. A small number
of
studies
either
combined
measurement
and
modelling
(Morakinyo et al., 2016; Tiwary et al., 2005) or solely employed a
modelling methodology (Morakinyo and Lam, 2016, 2015; Neft
et al., 2016; Tiwary et al., 2005). A comprehensive summary of
vegetation effects in open-road conditions and detailed technical
features with key findings are given in SI Tables S5 and S6,
respectively. The literature provided a number of examples of the
positive effect of trees and bushes on air quality i.e. reducing
pollutant concentrations at the street scale (Al-Dabbous and
Kumar, 2014; Brantley et al., 2014; Chen et al., 2015; Islam et al.,
2012; Lin et al., 2016; Shan et al., 2007; Tiwary et al., 2008, 2005;
Tong et al., 2016), with some cases having mixed and limited ef-
fects (Chen et al., 2016; Fantozzi et al., 2015; Grundstr€
om and
Pleijel, 2014; Hagler et al., 2012), or negative effects (Morakinyo
et al., 2016; Tong et al., 2015) with details shown in Table 4. As
shown in Fig. 4, the majority of the studies reported reductions in
concentrations of between 15% and 60% for various pollutants with
vegetation barriers along open roads. Most of the field measure-
ment studies comparing downwind concentrations with and
without the vegetation include background levels as part of their
measurements. However, this is usually not the case with most of
the modelling/wind tunnel studies that only account for the traffic
emissions. Recently, Baldauf (2017) detailed the physical charac-
teristics of vegetation barriers that influence air quality results,
some of which are discussed in further details in the following
sections.
4.1.1. Effect of thickness and density of green belt on air quality
The thickness and density of a green belt is a predominant
physical characteristic that can alter near-road pollution exposure
(Islam et al., 2012; Morakinyo and Lam, 2015; Neft et al., 2016; Shan
et al., 2007). An increase in the thickness of a vegetation barrier can
result in a direct reduction of pollutant concentrations (Neft et al.,
2016; Tong et al., 2016), with a linear correlation to increasing
filtration efficiency (Neft et al., 2016). Morakinyo and Lam (2016)
reported pollutant removal/reduction from hedges can be posi-
tive or negative and it is not uniform across height and length from
the barrier. Supporting this, Hagler et al. (2012) observed lower,
higher and similar concentrations behind vegetation barriers when
compared to open areas, as well as Lin et al. (2016) reporting dif-
ferences in concentrations at different heights, with these varia-
tions in results due to irregular density characteristics along the
length of the vegetation barriers examined. Morakinyo and Lam
(2016, 2015) proposed the need for design in locating hedges and
the selection of a suitable thickness for these barriers, recom-
mending the distance between the source and plume's maximum
concentration (DMC) and placing tree rows or vegetation barriers
close to the source or behind the DMC, ensuring sufficient thickness
to cover the DMC and a height close to plume height. Similarly,
studies by Islam et al. (2012) and Neft et al. (2016) recommended a
minimum vegetation thickness of 5 m and 10 m to remove
approximately 50% of total suspended particles (TSP) and nano-
particles (20 nm), respectively. In addition, Shan et al. (2007) rec-
ommended a minimum thickness of 5 m and an optimum thickness
of 10 m for a minimum removal rate of 50% for TSP. Islam et al.
(2012) proposed a structure of green belts in which hedges or
smaller shrubs were placed in front and trees behind to improve
TSP removal. The limited number of studies on this topic suggest
that further investigation of the relationship between vegetation
characteristics and emissions intensity is necessary prior to pro-
posing practical recommendations on the thickness of a selected
vegetation barrier to achieving specified desirable pollutant con-
centration reductions.
Densities of vegetation belts are commonly expressed in terms
of LAD, canopy density (CD), and shelterbelt porosity. Canopy
density is defined as the ratio between the projected area of the
canopy and the total ground area of the green belt/forest. Pollutant
removal improved with an increase in CD and LAD and decreased
with an increase in shelter belt porosity (Chen et al., 2016; Islam
et al., 2012; Shan et al., 2007; Tong et al., 2016), yet reductions in
pollutant concentration were non-linear with respect to LAD
(Steffens et al., 2012; Tong et al., 2016). An optimum CD of 70e85%
was recommended for 50% or more TSP reduction and for main-
taining a healthy green belt (Shan et al., 2007). Optimum shelter
belt porosity proposed by studies were 20e40% and 10e20% for TSP
and PM10 respectively (Chen et al., 2016; Islam et al., 2012). Shan
et al. (2007) observed that shelter belt porosity of less than 25%,
the percentage of TSP removal was stable, recommending an op-
timum shelter belt porosity of 25e33% for 50% or more TSP
removal. Increasing the canopy density over 85% and the shelter
belt porosity over 40% resulted in a decrease or no change in
pollutant removal as the vegetation was no longer acting as a
permeable structure, and more like a solid barrier (Islam et al.,
2012; Shan et al., 2007).
4.1.2. Effect of meteorological and climatic factors on air quality
Meteorological factors such as humidity, wind speed, wind di-
rection and temperature are also known to affect neighbourhood
air quality near open roads. The past studies revealed that the
highest impact on PM10 removal was exerted by relative humidity,
followed by the wind speed and the least by temperature (Chen
et al., 2015). Similarly, Fantozzi et al. (2015) observed high NO2
concentrations with high relative humidity and low temperature.
This indicates the important role of relative humidity in local air
pollutant exposure analysis. Studies observed an increase in
pollutant concentration with an increase in speed (Brantley et al.,
2014; Morakinyo et al., 2016). Studies that examine wind direc-
tion have predominantly focused on assessing downwind pollutant
concentrations in perpendicular wind conditions, with results
suggesting that the greatest reductions occur behind the vegetation
barriers for this wind direction (Brantley et al., 2014).
In addition to meteorological factors, seasonal variations and
different climates impact the role of vegetation belts on pollutant
exposure (Fantozzi et al., 2015; Grundstr€
om and Pleijel, 2014; Shan
et al., 2007). Seasonal variations in pollutant concentration were
captured through field assessments, with trees presenting the
greatest improvement in air quality in summer (Fantozzi et al.,
2015; Islam et al., 2012; Shan et al., 2007). Deciduous trees had

79
 no effect on PM removal in winter, with similar concentration
measured in open areas with no trees (Hagler et al., 2012; Lin et al.,
2016). Evergreen trees are commonly planted along open roads to
promote pollutant reductions in all seasons (Baldauf et al., 2013;
Islam et al., 2012; Shan et al., 2007). When it comes to climatic
zone, warmer climatic regions such as China, Bangladesh and Italy
(evidence in SI Tables S5 and S6) showed significant reduction in
pollutant concentrations with vegetation barriers (Chen et al., 2015,
2016; Fantozzi et al., 2015; Islam et al., 2012), while cooler climatic
regions such as Sweden and Finland showed limited or no change
in pollutant concentration with vegetation (Grundstr€
om and Pleijel,
2014; Set€
al€
a et al., 2013). No particular explanation for these dif-
ferences was provided in these studies and warrant further in-
vestigations, therefore further research is required in future
investigations to support recommendations for the role of green
infrastructures in air pollution abatement.
Chen et al. (2016) observed that grass was ineffective in
capturing PM2.5 in comparison to trees and shrubs. Significant
deposition of PM on herbaceous plants was measured along open
roads with different traffic intensities in Berlin (Weber et al., 2014).
The study observed that the rate of deposition on plant leaves
depended on the intensity of traffic emissions, leaf characteristics
and plant height.
5. Vegetation on building envelopes as a passive air pollution
control measure
Green walls and green roofs are developed as sustainable
building strategies which can increase vegetation cover in built up
areas without consuming space at street level. These green infra-
structure types were introduced for aesthetics purposes, but
nowadays they are maintained and improved to create a sustain-
able urban environment. Green walls and roofs contribute to pas-
sive energy savings, reductions in ambient temperature and

 mitigating the urban heat island effect, storm water management,
air pollution mitigation, noise reduction and urban biodiversity
(Berardi et al., 2014; Hunter et al., 2014; Manso and Castro-Gomes,
2015; P�
erez et al., 2014, 2011; Vijayaraghavan, 2016). Previous
studies mainly focused on thermal performances and energy sav-
ings of green walls and green roofs. However, unlike other green
infrastructures such as trees and hedges, these forms of vegetation
are directly attached to building surfaces and have not been
considered as a measure of air pollution abatement.
5.1. Green walls
Green walls are vegetated vertical surfaces where plants are
attached to the surface through various mechanisms. Green walls
are broadly classified as ‘green facades’ or ‘living wall’. Green fa-
cades are created by directly attaching hanging pots or shrubs to
the wall (direct green façade), or attached the plants to the wall
using special supporting features such as cables, ropes, mesh and
modular trellises (indirect green facades or double skinned green
facades). Living walls are created by attaching growing media to the
vertical wall, and this relatively new technique is classified as
‘continuous living walls’ or ‘modular living walls’ (Manso and
Castro-Gomes, 2015; P�
erez et al., 2014, 2011; Susorova, 2015). A
schematic representation of how green walls impact air flow and
pollutant dispersion in street canyon and open road environments
are shown in Figs. 1d and 2d, respectively. Green walls can improve
air quality and improve air quality from both local emission sources
and background concentrations, depending on the contribution
each source of pollution.
Limited studies have assessed the reduction of air pollution due
to green walls at a local scale in the built environment, but these
studies have recognised the potential capabilities of pollution
removal (Joshi and Ghosh, 2014; Ottel�
e et al., 2010; Sternberg et al.,
2010). Litschike and Kuttler (2008) recommended green walls as
one of the planting concepts to reduce particulates through depo-
sition without altering air exchange between the street canyon and
air above it. Detailed summaries and important observations are
listed in SI Table S7. Pollutant reduction along with a footpath in
open roads (Morakinyo et al., 2016; Tong et al., 2016) and in a street
canyon (Pugh et al., 2012) have been presented in research findings.
Moreover, other studies on green walls reported effective collection
of pollutants by the vegetation on the green wall (Joshi and Ghosh,
2014; Ottel�
e et al., 2010; Sternberg et al., 2010). Fig. 5a presents the
results from published studies on green walls relating to pollutant
concentrations. A city scale study showed significant improvement
in air quality with the green wall (Jayasooriya et al., 2016), but re-
ductions were not as substantial as the impact of trees (Jayasooriya
et al., 2016; Tong et al., 2016). In open road conditions, a green wall
resulted in dispersion patterns similar to the solid wall as a high
concentration region in front of barrier (on road) and reduction
behind the green wall (Morakinyo et al., 2016; Tong et al., 2016). In
addition, vegetation cover on the wall removed pollutants through
deposition (Joshi and Ghosh, 2014; Morakinyo et al., 2016; Tong
et al., 2016). In a street canyon environment, green wall improved
air quality in different street canyon aspect ratios (H/W ¼ 1 and 2),
with reductions of up to 35% for NO2 concentration and 50% in PM10
concentration (Pugh et al., 2012). Common climbing plants such as
ivy (UK) and Lianas species (in China) were found suitable for the
green wall (Chen et al., 2016; Ottel�
e et al., 2010; Sternberg et al.,
2010). The removal potential of pollutants using a green wall was
shown to be influenced by street canyon geometry, wind speed,
humidity and LAI (Joshi and Ghosh, 2014; Pugh et al., 2012). No
variations in particle depositions were observed at different heights
of the green wall near a traffic corridor (Ottel�
e et al., 2010). A study
by Pandey et al. (2014) suggests that air pollution tolerance should
be measured prior to selecting species for the green wall. These
observations were made based on limited previous research, and
further investigations are required to produce recommendations
for determining the role of green walls on air quality.
5.2. Green roofs
A green roof is a vegetation planted on the roof of a building.
Plants are cultivated on a growth media prior to being placed on the
building rooftop and can consists of diverse vegetation, from
mosses to small trees, growing substrate, filter and drainage ma-
terial, root barrier, and insulation (Vijayaraghavan, 2016). These are
classified as extensive, semi-intensive and intensive green roofs
(Berardi et al., 2014; Vijayaraghavan, 2016). The location of this
green infrastructure measure suggests that it may improve air
quality by reducing pollutant concentrations from local emissions
sources as well as background contributions. The most commonly
adopted system is an extensive system which has a thin substrate
layer with smaller plants such as grasses and mosses, due to its low
capital cost, low weight and minimal maintenance. Whereas an
intensive system requires high maintenance because of the thick
substrate layer, which accommodates larger plants such as small
trees, and this required more investment. A semi-intensive system
is a hybrid option with a moderate substrate, maintenance, and
capital cost. A typical green roof on a building in street canyon is
showed in Fig. 1d. Green roofs help reducing energy consumption,
managing runoff water, mitigating the urban heat island effect, air
pollution mitigation and noise pollution and enhance ecological
preservation (Berardi et al., 2014; Castleton et al., 2010; Czemiel
Berndtsson, 2010; Oberndorfer et al., 2007; Saadatian et al., 2013;
Vijayaraghavan, 2016).
Despite a number of studies examining various aspects of green

tration with vegetation barrier in Open road situations to the vegetation barrier free

improvement capabilities of green roofs (Baik et al., 2012; Berardi
et al., 2014; Currie and Bass, 2008; Li et al., 2010; Rowe, 2011;
Speak et al., 2012; Tan and Sia, 2005; Yang et al., 2008). Most
studies noted significant pollutant removal by green roofs, despite
being inferior to trees at both local scale (Speak et al., 2012) and city
scale (Currie and Bass, 2008; Jeanjean et al., 2015). Low surface
roughness and distance away from pollutant source were found as
reasons for its lower impact (Speak et al., 2012). Detailed infor-
mation on previous studies and their observations are given in SI
Table S8. The cooling effect of a green roof and its impact on air
quality in street canyons demonstrated a potential 32% reduction in
pollutant concentrations with 2 �C cooling intensity at breathing
level, due to enhanced canyon vortices and higher vertical disper-
sion arising from downward moving cool air (Baik et al., 2012). In
comparison, Pugh. et al. (2012) recorded marginal pollutant
removal by a green roof with no recognition of the associated
cooling effect. Roofs near a traffic corridor exhibited a significant
improvement of air quality (Speak et al., 2012) and the quantity of
fine particles (less than 0.56 mm) emitted from vehicle sources
decreased by 24% (Tan and Sia, 2005). The results for pollutant
concentration reductions for studies with green roofs are sum-
marised in Fig. 5b. The removal rate of green roofs is influenced by
wind conditions, seasonal variations, plant characteristics and
species, and green roof location (Currie and Bass, 2008; Li et al.,
2010; Speak et al., 2012; Yang et al., 2008). Intensive green roofs
can further increase pollutant removal (Currie and Bass, 2008; Yang
et al., 2008). Green roofs have potential to be used as a method of
air pollution abatement in combination with green walls.
6. Combination of green infrastructure with solid/nonporous
(passive) objects
Solid passive methods such as noise barriers, low boundary
walls, and parked cars can improve local air quality and detailed
strengths and limitations of these physical interventions are re-
ported in a comprehensive review by Gallagher et al. (2015).
However, the combined effect of solid passive methods and vege-
tation on neighbourhood air quality is something that has only
received limited attention (Abhijith and Gokhale, 2015; Baldauf
et al., 2008; Bowker et al., 2007; Tong et al., 2016). Furthermore,
the combination of these interventions is realistic of what is
evident in the urban environment. In research findings to date, the
combination of these air pollution control measures improves
pollutant dispersion characteristics for better air quality at local
scales
when
compared
to
that
obtained
with
individual
interventions.
Some arrangements of passive methods complemented one
another in reducing pollutant exposure than individual reductions.
A modelling study by Bowker et al. (2007) observed a combination
of trees and solid noise barriers resulted in enhanced dispersion
leading to reduced pollutant concentration in downwind locations.
Similarly, trees with a noise barrier caused additional mixing and
turbulence, as well as filtering of airborne particles by trees, leading
to consistent concentration reductions. As reported by Baldauf et al.
(2008), CO and PM concentrations were reduced immediately
behind a solid noise barrier and vegetation along an open road, in
comparison to the case of no inclusion of vegetation, both scenarios
providing better downwind air quality than no noise and/or vege-
tation barriers. The lowest PM number concentrations were
observed behind the noise barrier with trees along the entire dis-
tance measured from the road. These studies demonstrate the role
of additional green infrastructure to promote deposition in
conjunction with dispersion of localised emissions. Combining
trees with on-street car parking demonstrated how the combina-
tion of interventions had a greater impact on air quality than the
vegetation only case (Abhijith and Gokhale, 2015), and smaller trees
with spacing and high porosity combined with parallel parking
reduced pedestrian exposure in parallel and perpendicular winds
(Gallagher et al., 2013, 2011). An arrangement of trees on the
windward side of the street, in combination with perpendicular car
parking, improved air quality in oblique wind conditions (which is
considered to be most polluted wind direction; Section 3.1). The
combination of parked cars and trees presented the best air quality
improvements for local source emissions. However, it is dependent
on a combination of tree porosity, parking bay and local wind
characteristics. For example, oblique car parking systems with trees
showed an increase in pollutant concentration in street canyon

 (Abhijith and Gokhale, 2015). Vegetation-solid wall combinations
were also examined for multiple near-road conditions using
modelling by Tong et al. (2016). The study identified that the largest
pollutant reductions occurred when a solid wall and vegetation
barrier were combined.
The findings indicate that special arrangements for combining
vegetation
and
solid
passive
methods
could
provide
lower
pollutant exposure in both street canyon and open road conditions.
Further real-world studies are needed for validation and practical
application of outcomes.
7. From measurements, modelling and experiments to
delivering policy change
The current status of research relating to the performance of
green infrastructure on air quality presents a strong indication of its
potential to mitigate pollution and has identified existing gaps in
knowledge that still need to be addressed. However, transferring
the findings of existing and future research into proposed generic
recommendations is presented as the next milestone in this field.
Firstly, the findings from previous measurement studies have
demonstrated the potential of green infrastructure for reducing
personal exposure in street canyons and open roads under real
world conditions. However, these studies have been restricted by
their inability to directly compare precisely the same environment
with and without green infrastructure, due to the timeframe
required to implement mature trees, hedgerows or green roofs or
walls in the same location. Therefore modelling and wind-tunnel
experiments have been adopted and current findings originate
from these studies as they allow for this comparison. However,
their ability to replicate complex real-world meteorological con-
ditions and traffic flow characteristics may provide uncertainty in
these findings. In terms of developing recommendations, the use of
modelling and experimental work can provide a strong indicator as
to the expected performance of urban vegetation to affect local air
quality, but validation of these findings are required from the data
collected from previous measurement studies.
Secondly, the future for this research topic needs a focus on
collating additional results from measurement studies in different
meteoroidal and geometrical configurations. It also needs to
encourage the openness of raw data from these studies to allow
researchers using modelling and experiments to validate their
findings. The development of generic recommendations requires a
combined approach of each of these methods, as street canyon and
open road environments are complex and subject to change.
Therefore, the reach of measurement studies is constrained by
budgets, while the ability of modelling tools can extrapolate find-
ings for different climates and environments. The use of green
infrastructure can play a part in responsive solutions to air pollu-
tion, and be more than aesthetic and cultural benefits.
There is a level of uncertainty in modelling and experimental
results that does not exist in measurement studies, and this can
only be addressed through further research. It also highlights the
importance of this study and the synthesis of existing findings, to
direct the next steps for green infrastructure research in terms of
providing future guidance through generic recommendations to
improve air quality in the urban environment.
8. Summary, conclusions and future outlook
Available studies on the air quality impacts of vegetation placed
in street canyons, open roads, and building envelopes were
reviewed. The whole process of assessments was focused on un-
derstanding how air quality is affected by different types of vege-
tation under specific urban environments. This review analysed
and listed factors affecting air quality such as urban morphology,
meteorological conditions, vegetation characteristics, and observed
both favourable and critical air pollution scenarios created by them.
The common vegetation characteristics influencing neighbourhood
air quality were discussed. Local scale pollutant exposure alter-
ations made by street trees and hedges were recorded. Likewise, air
quality changes due to green belts in open road conditions and
vegetation on building envelopes such as green roofs and green
walls were reviewed. The study focused on changes in pollutant
concentration made by urban vegetation so that emerging findings
can be used by urban planners for practical application. In addition,
areas with a deficit in our knowledge or requiring further evidence
are also identified for consideration by future studies to advance
this research field.
The key conclusions arising are as follows:
� In a street canyon environment, high-level green infrastructure
(i.e. trees) generally has a negative impact on air quality while
low-level dense vegetation with complete coverage from the
ground to the top of the canopy (i.e. hedges) hinder the air flow
underneath and hence generally show a positive impact. Even
though an oblique wind direction was identified as critical;
improvements or deteriorations in air quality in a street canyon
depended upon a combination of aspect ratio, vegetation den-
sity and wind direction. Increasing the spacing between trees
and reducing the cross-sectional area occupied by tree canopies
(through increased pruning and selecting smaller trees) can
usually reduce street level personal exposure through increased
ventilation. Available real world studies showed that sur-
rounding built-up geometry can alter pollutant concentration
profiles in street canyons. It was also noted that the predomi-
nant source of pollution in a street canyon environment was
vehicular emissions, therefore the findings may reflect upon
their impact on local emission sources more so than the back-
ground pollutant contributions. There are a limited number of
studies examining hedges in street canyons, with results
showing improvements in air quality and a proposed optimum
height of hedge in shallow street canyons; detailed studies are
required to provide favourable hedge dimensions and densities
in different aspect ratios and meteorological conditions.
� In open road conditions, vegetation barriers have a positive
impact on air quality with thick, dense and tall vegetation.
Studies
observed
considerable
pollutant
removal
through
designing vegetation barriers closer to the pollutant source and
plume's maximum concentration. In excess of a 50% reduction
was observed with a 10 m thick green belt for numerous pol-
lutants. The optimum density for a vegetation barrier was sug-
gested
by
various
studies.
Evergreen
species
and
other
vegetation not prone to seasonal effects were proposed for
vegetation barriers in open-road conditions. In a similar manner
to research findings from street canyon studies, the source of
pollutants (i.e. local or background) was not differentiated in
open road studies, but these mitigation measures were also
considered to have a more significant impact upon local emis-
sion sources. Relative humidity showed significant impact on
pollutant removal by green belts indicating that climate and
regional conditions need to be considered. The impact of vege-
tation on air quality varied between warmer and cooler climatic
regions, which needs further investigation.
� Vegetation density has been represented by often dissimilar
parameters in published investigations. This study observed the
need for standardisation in expressing vegetation density, as it is
important to facilitate a comparison of study outputs and to
create generalised recommendations.

 � The combination of vegetation and solid passive air pollution
control measures has the potential to maximise the reduction in
pollutant concentrations and improve personal exposure con-
ditions, more than that achieved any individual intervention in
both street canyon and open road conditions.
� Only a small number of studies investigated air quality im-
provements for green roofs and green walls. Reported reduction
in air pollutants with green walls ranged up to 95% than green
wall free scenario and in the case of the green roof, the same was
2%e52%. However, their ability to remove pollutants were lesser
compared to trees and vegetation barriers. Pollution reduction
of green roofs was inferior to the green wall. These interventions
require less spatial requirements than trees and green belts and
can be part of building surfaces and structures such as bridges,
fly-overs, retaining walls, and noise barriers. Further in-
vestigations are required to produce generic recommendations.
This review identified similarities in the designs and conditions
of vegetation to achieve air quality benefits in open road and street
canyon environment, although street canyon configurations are
more complex and less easy to provide generic recommendations.
Prior to implementing vegetation in street canyons, pilot modelling
investigations can give possible locations and vegetation parame-
ters to maximise its impact for least polluted conditions. Future
investigations should focus on the impact of the relationship be-
tween vegetation and climatic zone, on air quality. Future studies
should also focus on air pollution control potential of green roofs
and green walls as both can be implemented in cities without
consuming additional space.
