SUMMARY
An imbalance between excitatory/inhibitory neuro-
transmission has been posited as a central charac-
teristic of the neurobiology of autism [1], inspired in
part by the striking prevalence of seizures among in-
dividuals with the disorder [2]. Evidence supporting
this
hypothesis
has
specifically
implicated
the
signaling pathway of the inhibitory neurotransmitter,
g-aminobutyric acid (GABA), in this putative imbal-
ance: GABA receptor genes have been associated
with autism in linkage and copy number variation
studies [3–7], fewer GABA receptor subunits have
been observed in the post-mortem tissue of autistic
individuals [8, 9], and GABAergic signaling is disrup-
ted across heterogeneous mouse models of autism
[10]. Yet, empirical evidence supporting this hypoth-
esis in humans is lacking, leaving a gulf between
animal and human studies of the condition. Here,
we present a direct link between GABA signaling
and autistic perceptual symptomatology. We first
demonstrate a robust, replicated autistic deficit in
binocular rivalry [11], a basic visual function that is
thought to rely on the balance of excitation/inhibition
in visual cortex [12–15]. Then, using magnetic reso-
nance spectroscopy, we demonstrate a tight linkage
between binocular rivalry dynamics in typical partic-
ipants and both GABA and glutamate levels in the vi-
sual cortex. Finally, we show that the link between
GABA and binocular rivalry dynamics is completely
and specifically absent in autism. These results sug-
gest a disruption in inhibitory signaling in the autistic
brain and forge a translational path between animal
and human models of the condition.
RESULTS AND DISCUSSION
During binocular rivalry, two images, one presented to each eye,
vie for perceptual dominance as neuronal populations that are
selective for each eye’s input suppress each other in alternation
[16, 17]. The strength of perceptual suppression during rivalry is
thought to depend on the balance of inhibitory and excitatory
cortical dynamics [12–15] and may serve as a non-invasive
perceptual marker of the putative perturbation in inhibitory
signaling thought to characterize the autistic brain.
We therefore measured the dynamics of binocular rivalry in in-
dividuals with and without a diagnosis of autism (41 individuals,
20 with autism). As predicted, individuals with autism demon-
strated a slower rate of binocular rivalry (switches per trial: con-
trols = 8.68, autism = 4.19; F(1,37) = 16.52, hp
2 = 0.311, p =
0.001; Figure 1A), which was marked by reduced periods of
perceptual suppression (proportion of each trial spent viewing
a dominant percept, (dominant percept durations)/(dominant +
mixed percept durations): controls = 0.69; autism = 0.55;
F(1,36) = 7.27, hp
2 = 0.172, p = 0.011; Figure 1B). The strength
of perceptual suppression inversely predicted clinical measures
of autistic symptomatology (Autism Diagnostic Observation
Schedule [ADOS]: Rs = �0.39, p = 0.027; Figure 1) and showed
high test-retest reliability in a control experiment (R = 0.94, p <
0.001; see Supplemental Experimental Procedures and also
[18]). These results replicate our previous findings in an indepen-
dent sample of autistic individuals [11] and confirm rivalry disrup-
tions as a robust behavioral marker of autism.
To test whether altered binocular rivalry dynamics in autism are
linked to the reduced action of inhibitory (g-aminobutyric acid
[GABA]) or excitatory (glutamate [Glx]) neurotransmitters in the
brain, we measured the concentration of these neurotransmitters
in visual cortex using magnetic resonance spectroscopy (MRS).
Spectra were acquired from an occipital voxel (2.5 3 2.5 3
3 cm), centered bilaterally on the calcarine sulcus (Figure 2A).
GABA and glutamate are predicted to contribute to different
aspects of binocular rivalry dynamics: mutual inhibition be-
tween (GABA) and recurrent excitation within (glutamate) pop-
ulations of neurons coding for the two oscillating percepts
[14]. Specifically, in classic models of binocular rivalry, a period
of perceptual suppression is maintained through excitation
within the neuronal population selective for the dominant im-
age, as well as cross-inhibition of the neuronal population se-
lective for the non-dominant image [12, 19, 20]. Critically,
reducing either mutual inhibition or recurrent excitation is pre-
dicted to reduce the strength of perceptual suppression during
rivalry in one implementation of this model [14], mirroring the
dynamics we observed in autism. We therefore considered
each neurotransmitter separately to test whether inhibitory or
excitatory signaling was selectively disrupted in the autistic
brain.
Given prior evidence from genetic, animal, and post-mortem
studies, we hypothesized that inhibitory signaling may be
affected in the autistic brain. This disruption could take the
form of reduced levels of GABA or glutamate. However, reports

 of perturbations of key components of the GABA signaling
pathway, such as receptors [3–9] and inhibitory neuronal density
[10], suggest that GABA levels themselves may not be altered in
autism but instead may be less predictive of rivalry dynamics.
As predicted by models of binocular rivalry, GABA concentra-
tions in visual cortex strongly predicted rivalry dynamics in con-
trols, where more GABA corresponded to longer periods of
perceptual suppression (Rs = 0.62, p = 0.002; Figure 2B). How-
ever, this relationship was strikingly absent in individuals with
autism (Rs = 0.02, p = 0.473; Figure 2B). The difference between
the two correlations was significant (hp
2 = 0.167, p = 0.013; Fig-
ure 2C), indicating a reduced impact of GABA on perceptual sup-
pression in the autistic brain.
Importantly, this finding was specific to GABA: glutamate
strongly predicted the dynamics of binocular rivalry in autism
(Rs = 0.60, p = 0.004; Figure 2B), to the same degree as that
found in controls (Rs = 0.40, p = 0.031 in controls; p = 0.71 for
the difference of this effect between autism and controls; Fig-
ure 2C). The absence of a group difference in the concentrations
of GABA and Glx (both p > 0.32; Figure S1; Table S2) indicate
that GABA levels themselves are not altered in the autistic visual
cortex [21], despite a specific reduction in the effect of GABA on
autistic visual behavior. These findings suggest that alterations in
the GABAergic signaling pathway may characterize autistic
neurobiology. Consistent with prior evidence from animal and
post-mortem studies, such dysfunction may arise from perturba-
tions in key components of the GABAergic pathway beyond
GABA levels, such as receptors [3–9] and inhibitory neuronal
density [10].
These results demonstrate reduced GABAergic, but con-
served glutamatergic, action in the autistic visual system. No
other metabolite measured predicted rivalry dynamics in either
group (all p > 0.11 for TNAA, TCho, TCr, and Ins), and GABA
was the only metabolite to show a markedly reduced impact
on the dynamics of binocular rivalry in autism (all other effects
between autism and controls: p > 0.29; Figure 2C). Furthermore,
this relationship was specific to GABA measured in the visual
cortex: binocular rivalry dynamics were not related to any metab-
olites measured in a control region of interest, the motor cortex,
in either group (all Rs < 0.17, all p > 0.25).
The specificity of this effect to GABA and not glutamate argues
against the possibility that these findings are driven by differ-
ences in the spectral quality between the two groups. Further,
spectral fit errors (an indication of data quality) and frequency
drift (an indication of subject motion) were within the expected
ranges and matched between groups (all p > 0.46; Figure S1;
Table S2). Repeatability control experiments indicated that our
metabolite measurements were highly reliable (coefficient of
variation [CVs] < 8%) with a high reproducibility relative to the ef-
fect range of our study (SDs < 13% of the group range for each
metabolite) (see Supplemental Experimental Procedures). These
results confirm previous reports of high test-retest reliability of
in vivo MRS measurements [22] and add to a growing literature
of replicated relationships between GABA concentration and
psychophysical
performance,
including
sensory
sensitivity
thresholds [23, 24], motor response inhibition [25], and binocular
rivalry dynamics [15, 26].
Atypical sensory perception has been noted since the earliest
reports of autism [27], although little is known about the neural
underpinnings of these symptoms. Interestingly, recent reports
of reduced spatial suppression [28], decreased global motion
perception [29, 30], larger population receptive fields [31], and
more variable evoked responses [32, 33] in autism mirror the
perceptual consequences of reduced GABAergic inhibition in
animal studies [34, 35]. Computational accounts suggest that

 reducing inhibition may account for a wide range of autistic
perceptual symptoms [36]. One such account predicted reduced
perceptual suppression during rivalry in autism but found only a
trend toward the finding ([37], but see [38]). Further work is
needed to test whether this litany of visual disruptions indeed re-
sults from reduced GABAergic signaling in the autistic brain, as
we demonstrate here for one robust autistic visual symptom.
Our findings provide evidence for an empirical link between a
specific neurotransmitter measured in the brains of individuals
with autism and an autistic behavioral symptom. Although
perceptual in nature, this symptom strongly predicts higher-order
clinical measures of autistic symptomatology and may be well
poised to serve as a behavioral marker of a perturbation in
GABAergicsignalingin theautistic brain. Togetherwiththepivotal
roles of GABA in canonical cortical computations [39] and neuro-
development [40], these findings point to the GABAergic signaling
pathway as a prime suspect in the neurobiology of this pervasive
developmental disorder [41]. Future work should replicate these
findings and investigate GABAergic signaling in autism at multiple
developmental time points to establish whether GABAergic per-
turbations predict, or arise in response to, the developmental
onset of autistic symptomatology.
EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURES
Participants
We tested 41 adolescents and adults: 21 controls and 20 autism, matched for
age and IQ (Table S1). All individuals with autism met DSM-IV diagnostic
criteria (15 Asperger’s, 1 high-functioning autism, 4 pervasive developmental
disorder not otherwise specified [PDD-NOS]), as assessed by an experienced
clinician, and met cutoff for the category ‘‘Autism Spectrum Disorder’’ after a
research-reliable administration of the ADOS-2 [42]. Twelve participants
(1 control, 11 autism) were being treated with psychiatric medications: antide-
pressants (n = 8), antipsychotics (n = 2), antiepileptics (n = 4), and anxiolytics
(n = 2). Excluding participants taking medications known to interact with the
GABAergic system (n = 8) did not qualitatively alter the results. All participants
had normal or corrected-to-normal vision and IQ > 70. Written consent was
obtained in accordance with a protocol approved by the Massachusetts Insti-
tute of Technology Institutional Review Board.
Binocular Rivalry Paradigm and Analysis
Binocular rivalry stimuli and analysis were identical to those used in [11], except
that the stimuli were slightly smaller. On each run, two grayscale objects (e.g., a
baseball and a piece of broccoli) appeared on the left and right of the screen.
Each object was displayed within a tinted square (green or red; width: 2.2�), sur-
rounded by a black circle to support binocular fusion (radius: 3.1�). Stimuli were
viewed through a mirror stereoscope, which reflected the left and right sides of
the screen into the participants’ left and right eyes so that each eye was pre-
sented with only one of the two images (red or green).
Testing sessions were composed of two 30-s practice runs and six 45-s
experimental runs. Participants were asked to continuously report whether
they perceived a fully dominant percept—the red image (right key) or the green
image (left key)—or a mixture of the two images (up key).
Since the key press was continuous (sampling rate: 4 ms), a sequence of
perceptual transitions was computed as events in which one continuous key
press was terminated and another began. For each participant and trial, the
frequency of perceptual switches as well as the duration of any percept (red,

(A) Magnetic resonance spectra were acquired from individuals with and
without autism: one example control (left) and autistic (right) participant shown
here, with the acquisition region (visual cortex) shown in color (80% probability
of VOI placement). Spectra included the neurotransmitters predicted to govern
binocular rivalry dynamics from computational models, GABA and glutamate,
as well as control metabolites TNAA, TCho, TCr, and Ins.
(B) GABA strongly predicted the strength of perceptual suppression during
rivalry in control individuals (Rs = 0.062, p = 0.002, top left), but this rela-
tionship was absent in autism (Rs = 0.02, p = 0.473, top right). However,
glutamate strongly predicted binocular rivalry dynamics in both controls
(rho = 0.40, p = 0.031, bottom left) and autism (Rs = 0.60, p = 0.004, bottom
right).
(C) GABA was the only molecule to show a significantly stronger effect on ri-
valry dynamics in controls, as compared to autism, demonstrating a selective

all plots, medicated individuals are labeled with unfilled circles.

tion of perceptual suppression, was calculated as the proportion of each trial
spent viewing a fully dominant percept: (dominant percept durations)/
(dominant + mixed percept durations).
See Supplemental Experimental Procedures for information regarding test-
retest reliability of rivalry dynamics.
MRI and MRS Acquisition
Magnetic resonance (MR) data were collected using a Siemens Trio 3T MRI
scanner at MIT, equipped with a 32-channel head coil. At the beginning of
each scan session, we acquired a high-resolution, whole-brain anatomical vol-
ume using a T1-weighted MPRAGE sequence (124 slices; voxels = 1 3 1 3
1 mm; repetition time = 2,530 ms; echo time = 2.94 ms; matrix = 256 3
256 3 176 mm; field of view = 256 3 256 3 176 mm).
Subsequently, single voxel 1H MR spectra (MRS) were acquired from early
visual and motor volumes of interest (VOIs). Prior to MRS acquisition, whole-
volume first and second-order shims were adjusted using the automatic
GRE shim sequence, and manual shimming was additionally performed within
each VOI to optimize magnetic field homogeneity (mean full width at half
maximum of water signal: 15.9 Hz [controls], 15.2 Hz [autism]; mean T2*:
39.7 ms [controls], 40.7 ms [autism]).
A Mescher-Garwood Point Resolved Spectroscopy (MEGA-PRESS) scan
[43] (320 spectral averages; repetition time = 1,500 ms; echo time = 68 ms;
eight-step phase cycle) and a localized unsuppressed water scan (four aver-
ages; repetition time = 10,000 ms; echo time = 30 ms) were acquired in
each VOI. A frequency-selective inversion pulse was applied at 1.9 and
7.5 ppm in alternating spectral lines, and the edit-ON and edit-OFF spectra
were subtracted to generate a difference spectrum containing total GABA.
The visual cortex VOI (2.5 3 2.5 3 3.0 cm) was placed using standard
anatomical landmarks [44], angled along the calcarine sulcus and set dorsal
to the cerebellum and anterior from the anterior sinus. The motor cortex VOI
(2.5 3 2.5 3 3.0 cm) was centered on the hand knob of the left hemisphere
and angled along the primary motor strip [45].
During the MEGA-PRESS scan of visual cortex, participants performed a
simple visual task at fixation. During the MEGA-PRESS scan of motor cortex,
participants performed a simple finger-tapping task.
MRI Analysis
Individuals’ anatomical scans were reconstructed and segmented into gray
matter, white matter, and cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) maps using statistical para-
metric mapping (SPM8, Wellcome Trust Center for Neuroimaging). The tissue
composition within each VOI was computed by creating a mask of the portion
of the anatomical volume covered by the VOI.
MRS Analysis
GABA concentration was quantified from the MEGA-PRESS difference sub-
spectra using the Gannet GABA analysis toolkit [46]. Gannet models the
GABA peak using a simple, five-parameter Gaussian model, fit between
2.19 and 3.55 ppm and the water peak using a Gaussian-Lorentzian function.
Gannet applies a correction factor for co-edited macromolecule signal and ed-
iting efficiency during water scaling (see below). All other metabolic signals
were quantified from the edit-OFF subspectra using TARQUIN [47], which
uses a linear combination of simulated basis sets based on quantum calcula-
tions to fit spectra in the time domain. Macromolecules are modeled as com-
ponents of the TARQUIN fit.
In all analyses, metabolite values were scaled to water and expressed in
institutional units (IU). Nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) visible water was
estimated at 78%, as each VOI primarily contained gray matter [48], and
the following formula was used to calculate the water relaxation factor:
exp(�TEwater/T2water)/exp(�TEmetabs/T2metabs). The resulting metabolite con-
centrations were corrected for the proportion of gray matter in each VOI.
Crame
´ r-Rao lower bound values were reliably < 20% for each metabolite
and group (GABA: 6.53 [autism], 5.41 [control]; Glx: 8.88 [autism], 9.12 [con-
trol]). Therefore, all fitted spectra were accepted for analysis (Figure S2).
In total, we were able to resolve the metabolic signals of the following mol-
ecules: GABA, Glx, TNAA, TCho, TCr, and myo-inositol (Ins). Glutamate and its
metabolic precursor glutamine were fitted together (Glx) due to their overlap-
ping resonances at 3T, as were N-Acetylaspartate and N-acetylaspartylgluta-
mate (TNAA), creatine and phosphocreatine (TCr), and glycerophosphocholine
and phosphocholine (TCho).
It should be noted that MEGA-PRESS measurements of GABA typically
include macromolecule signals with similar resonant frequencies. As a result,
they are often referred to as GABA+. All results were qualitatively similar to
those reported here when metabolites were quantified using the MRS analysis
software LCModel.
See Supplemental Experimental Procedures for information regarding test-
retest reliability of MRS measurements.
Statistical Analyses
Spearman’s rank correlations coefficients (Rs) were used to compare the rela-
tionship between neurotransmitter concentrations and rivalry dynamics. Two-
tailed, uncorrected p values were calculated from permutation tests, and
correlation coefficients were calculated from bootstrapped confidence inter-
vals of these correlations, sampled 10,000 times with replacement. The
strength of two relationships was computed by performing an F test on the
linear regression coefficients of each relationship. All results remained signifi-
cant using Pearson’s coefficients (all p < 0.02) and when results were cor-
rected for multiple comparisons between GABA and Glx (all p < 0.026).
Participants whose rivalry percept durations were determined to fall outside
of 2 SDs of the group mean were excluded from analyses (one control, two
autism). One autism participant was unable to complete the MRS scan.
Participants’ psychometric data (age and IQ, on which the two groups were
matched) did not correlate with any of our experimental variables of interest (all
p > 0.212). Therefore, statistical analyses were performed without psychomet-
ric data included as covariates.
