Abstract
Background and objectives Marijuana use has become more widely accepted in the United States and has been
legalized in many areas. Although it is biologically plausible that marijuana could affect kidney function,
epidemiologic data are lacking.
Design, setting, participants, & measurements We conducted a cohort study among young adults with preserved
eGFR (i.e., eGFR$60 ml/min per 1.73 m2) using data from the Coronary Artery Risk Development in Young
Adults (CARDIA) study. At scheduled examinations occurring every 5 years and starting at study year 10
(calendar years, 1995–1996), cystatin C was collected over a 10-year period, and urine albumin-to-creatinine ratio
was collected over a 15-year period. We investigated the cross-sectional association between current and
cumulative marijuana use (in marijuana-years; one marijuana-year equals 365 days of marijuana use) and eGFR
by cystatin C (eGFRcys) at year 10. In longitudinal analyses, we investigated the association between cumulative
marijuanause andeGFRcys change and rapid($3%/year)eGFRcysdecline over two5-year intervals andprevalent
albuminuria (urine albumin-to-creatinine ratio $30 mg/g) over a 15-year period.
Results Past or current marijuana use was reported by 83% (3131 of 3765) of the cohort, and the mean eGFRcys was
111 ml/min per 1.73 m2 at year 10. Over the following 10 years, 504 had rapid eGFRcys decline, and over the
following 15 years, 426 had prevalent albuminuria. Compared with no use, daily current use and $5 marijuana-
years of cumulative use were associated with lower eGFRcys at year 10: 24.5% (95% confidence interval, 28.1 to
20.7%; P=0.02) and 23.0% (95% confidence interval, 25.6 to 20.4%; P=0.03), respectively. Marijuana use was not
significantly associated with eGFRcys change, rapid eGFRcys decline, or prevalent albuminuria.
Conclusions Although we identified a modest cross-sectional association between higher marijuana exposure
and lower eGFRcys among young adults with preserved eGFR, our findings were largely null and did not
demonstrate a longitudinal association between marijuana use and eGFRcys change, rapid eGFRcys decline, or
prevalent albuminuria.

Introduction
In the United States, legalization of marijuana for
medical and recreational purposes has become more
common, and marijuana use has increased over the
last decade according to some reports (1–6). Associ-
ations between marijuana use and adverse psychoso-
cial, cognitive, and respiratory outcomes have been
demonstrated (7–11), but the effect of marijuana use
on kidney disease has been largely unexplored. CKD
affects .20 million Americans (12), and the identifi-
cation of potentially modifiable risk factors for ad-
verse kidney outcomes is of public health importance.
Marijuana is derived from the hemp plant (Cannabis
sativa) (13), which contains .60 cannabinoid mole-
cules, including D9-tetrahydrocannabinol, which is
primarily responsible for its psychoactive properties
(14,15). The initial discovery of D9-tetrahydrocannab-
inol prompted the identification of the endogenous
cannabinoid system, consisting of the cannabinoid
receptors CB1 and CB2 and their endogenous ligands,
and its recognition as an important physiologic
regulator (14,16). In the kidney, the endogenous
cannabinoid system plays a role in regulating kidney
hemodynamics and sodium transport (14), and animal
models suggest that CB1 activity may contribute to the
pathogenesis of diabetic and obesity-related nephrop-
athy and kidney fibrosis (17–21), whereas CB2 activity
may be reno-protective (22–24).
Although it is biologically plausible that marijuana
may play a role in the pathogenesis of kidney disease,
data in humans are limited to case reports of AKI in
the setting of synthetic cannabinoid use (25–27) and
single-center studies of small sample size and rela-
tively short duration (28–30). The Coronary Artery
Risk Development in Young Adults (CARDIA) study
provides an opportunity to investigate whether mar-
ijuana use has implications for kidney disease in a
large cohort of young adults with preserved eGFR and

 marijuana exposure documented over the course of 25 years.
Our primary aim was to investigate the association between
marijuana exposure and eGFR. We hypothesized that mar-
ijuana exposure would be associated with lower eGFR.
Materials and Methods
Study Design and Population
We conducted a cohort study using data from the
CARDIA study, which was designed to investigate the
development and determinants of cardiovascular disease in
young adults (31). Briefly, 5115 healthy black and white
women and men aged 18–30 years were enrolled between
1985 and 1986 from four centers in the United States
(Birmingham, AL; Chicago, IL; Minneapolis, MN; and
Oakland, CA). Follow-up examinations were completed at
study years 2, 5, 7, 10, 15, 20, and 25. Marijuana measures
were collected at each study visit; cystatin C was collected
at years 10, 15, and 20; and urine albumin-to-creatinine
ratio was collected at years 10, 15, 20, and 25. All participants
provided written informed consent, and the institutional
review boards at each center approved the study protocol.
Our study cohort consisted of 3765 persons with a
cystatin C measurement at year 10 and preserved eGFR (i.e.,
eGFR$60 ml/min per 1.73 m2 on the basis of the available
serum creatinine at year 0). We restricted the cohort to
persons with preserved eGFR in order to have a homoge-
neous and generalizable study population. In a cross-
sectional analysis, we investigated the association between
marijuana use and eGFR by cystatin C (eGFRcys) at year 10.
In longitudinal analyses, we investigated the association
between marijuana use and change in eGFRcys and rapid
($3%/year) eGFRcys decline over two 5-year intervals (i.e.,
years 10–15 and 15–20) among persons with cystatin C
measures at two consecutive study visits (n=3118). In a
longitudinal analysis, we also examined the association
between marijuana use and prevalent albuminuria (urine
albumin-to-creatinine ratio $30 mg/g) over a 15-year
period (from years 10 to 25) among persons with a urine
albumin-to-creatinine ratio measurement at year 10
(n=3732).
Exposure Measures
Marijuana use was assessed at each study visit (years
0, 2, 5, 7, 10, 15, 20, and 25) with a self-administered
questionnaire. Current use was reported as the number of
days of marijuana use within the 30 days preceding each
study visit, and lifetime use was reported as the number of
times marijuana had been used in one’s lifetime. Until year
10, the quantity of marijuana used on a typical day (in joints
or filled pipe bowls smoked) was assessed.
Using data on lifetime marijuana use reported at year 0,
the current frequency of marijuana use, and the quantity of
marijuana smoked per day, we calculated cumulative
marijuana exposure in marijuana-years (one marijuana-
year is equivalent to 365 days of marijuana use) and joint-
years (one joint-year is equivalent to 365 joints or filled pipe
bowls smoked) at each study visit as previously described
(Supplemental Appendix 1) (10,32).
The primary exposures were cumulative and current
marijuana use. We considered marijuana-years as the
primary means of assessing cumulative exposure because
these data were available for the entire duration of follow-
up. We also performed an exploratory analysis with
cumulative use expressed in joint-years, with use beyond
year 10 estimated as detailed in Supplemental Appendix 1,
in order to capture associations with quantity of use. As
previously defined by our research group (10,32), marijuana
use was categorized as follows: cumulative use in mari-
juana-years (never, .0–,0.5, 0.5–,2, 2–,5, and $5),
cumulative use in joint-years (never, .0–5, .5–10, and
.10), and current use (none, 1–10, 11–29, and 30 days).
Outcome Measures
Using stored sera collected at years 10, 15, and 20 as part
of an ancillary study, cystatin C measurements were
performed simultaneously at the University of Minnesota
by nephelometry with the N Latex cystatin C kit (Dade
Behring, now Siemens, Munich, Germany) and calibrated
for drift as previously described (33). Kidney function was
estimated using the 2012 CKD Epidemiology Collaboration
cystatin C equation and expressed as eGFRcys (ml/min per
1.73 m2) (34). As in prior CARDIA analyses, we estimated
kidney function using cystatin C rather than creatinine
because cystatin C–based methods have been demon-
strated to have superior accuracy among those with pre-
served kidney function (35,36) and allow for earlier
detection of decrements in kidney function (37). Addition-
ally, simultaneous measurements of cystatin C performed
in a single laboratory optimized precision and our ability to
interpret changes in kidney function. Albumin-to-creati-
nine ratio was measured from untimed (spot) urine sam-
ples collected at years 10, 15, 20, and 25 and expressed in
milligrams of albumin per gram of creatinine. Urine
albumin was measured using nephelometry, and urine
creatinine was assessed using the Jaffé method (38).
Our primary outcomes were: (1) log-transformed eGFRcys
at year 10; (2) annualized changes in eGFRcys between years
10–15 and 15–20, as percentages of the value at the beginning
of the interval; and (3) rapid eGFRcys decline ($3%/year)
between years 10–15 and 15–20 (n=518 events). Prevalent
albuminuria (urine albumin-to-creatinine ratio $30 mg/g) at
year 10, 15, 20, or 25 (n=640 events) was a secondary
outcome. Cystatin C was available in 3765, 3118, and 2995
participants in years 10, 15, and 20, respectively, but was not
available at year 25.
Covariates
Age, race, sex, income, employment, education, and
substance use were obtained with a self-administered
questionnaire. Substance use was expressed in cumulative
years of tobacco smoking; heavy and binge alcohol use; and
cocaine, amphetamine, and heroin use as previously de-
scribed (10). At each study visit, three seated systolic and
diastolic BPs were obtained with a sphygmomanometer in
years 0–15 and automated oscillometric BP monitor in years
20 and 25, and the mean of the second and third readings
was calculated. Diabetes was defined as a fasting blood
glucose $126 mg/dl or use of insulin and/or oral hypo-
glycemic medications. Hyperlipidemia was defined as an
LDL cholesterol .130 mg/dl or use of lipid-lowering
medications. Body mass index was calculated from
weight measured with light clothing and height without
shoes (39). Physical activity score was obtained by a

 validated interviewer-administered questionnaire and
log-transformed (10,39).
Statistical Analyses
We compared baseline characteristics at year 10 by
category of marijuana use using chi-squared and Krus-
kal–Wallis testing as appropriate. At year 10, we used
linear regression to estimate the associations of cumulative
and current marijuana use, modeled as separate exposures,
with log-transformed eGFRcys. The back-transformed esti-
mates for each category of marijuana use can be inter-
preted as the percent difference in eGFRcys compared with
the referent category. We chose year 10 as the baseline
timepoint because this was the first visit at which cystatin
C was available.
Models for the longitudinal outcomes focused only on
cumulative marijuana use because this was thought to
be the relevant exposure for outcomes that may reflect
cumulative toxicity rather than acute effects. We used linear
mixed models to estimate the association of cumulative
marijuana use, treated as a time-dependent exposure,
with repeated annualized changes in eGFRcys over the
year 10–15 and 15–20 intervals, as percentages of the year
10 and 15 values, respectively. We modeled eGFRcys
changes in 5-year intervals in order to account for non-
linearity in rates of decline. Within-participant correlation
was modeled using an unstructured correlation matrix for
the residuals. We then used generalized estimating equa-
tion Poisson models with robust SEMs to evaluate the
association between cumulative marijuana use, treated as a
time-dependent exposure, and the following repeated bi-
nary outcomes: (1) rapid decline in eGFRcys in the year 10–15
and 15–20 intervals and (2) prevalent albuminuria at year 10,
15, 20, or 25. In the model for prevalent albuminuria,
participants contributed to the analysis at all years in
which they experienced the outcome.
For each outcome, we performed an unadjusted and
multivariable-adjusted analysis controlling for age, race,
sex, study site, income, education, employment, systolic
and diastolic BP, diabetes, hyperlipidemia, body mass
index, physical activity, and cumulative years of tobacco
smoking, heavy and binge alcohol use, and cocaine, amphet-
amine, and heroin use. Adjustment variables were evaluated
at year 10 in the analysis for eGFRcys and treated as time-
varying (if subject to change) in the analyses for the longitu-
dinal outcomes. We performed tests for trend across categories
of marijuana use and tested for interaction by race, sex, and
tobacco smoking status categorized as never, former, or
current. In order to account for the possibility of informative
censoring due to loss to follow-up, we performed sensitivity
analyses with inverse probability of censoring weighting.
The tests for statistical significance were two-tailed, and
P,0.05 was considered significant. Analyses were performed
with STATA version 14 (StataCorp LP, College Station, TX).
Results
At year 10, the majority of the study cohort (3131 out of 3765
[83%]) reported past or current marijuana use; the mean age
was 35 years, and the mean eGFRcys was 111 ml/min per
1.73 m2. The proportion of current marijuana use was highest
at years 0 and 2 but remained persistently .15% throughout
the entire follow-up period (Figure 1). Characteristics asso-
ciated with cumulative marijuana use included age, sex,
race, study site, income, employment, education, BP, body
mass index, and physical activity (Table 1). Current mar-
ijuana use and use of other substances were also higher
among those with higher cumulative marijuana use.

 We did not observe a dose-response relationship be-
tween cumulative marijuana use and eGFRcys at year 10.
However, there was an association with lower eGFRcys at
year 10 among those with at least 5 marijuana-years of use
(Table 2). There was a statistically significant interaction
with race (P value for interaction=0.03) (Table 2), but the
findings appeared similar for men and women (P value for
interaction=0.56). There was a statistically significant in-
teraction by tobacco smoking status (P,0.001). Among
those with at least 5 marijuana-years of use, the point
estimates for the marijuana associations with eGFRcys were
in the direction of harm in multivariable-adjusted models
for never (percent difference eGFRcys, 21.4%; 95% CI, 25.9 to
3.4%; P=0.56) and former (percent difference eGFRcys, 26.4%;
95% CI, 211.8 to 20.7%; P=0.03), but not current (percent
difference eGFRcys, 6.7%; 95% CI, 1.2 to 12.6%; P=0.02),
tobacco smokers. Higher levels of current marijuana use were
associated with lower eGFRcys at year 10 in multivariable-
adjusted models, and the interaction with race was statisti-
cally significant (P value for interaction=0.04) (Supplemental
Table 1). Findings appeared similar for men and women
(P value for interaction=0.82).

 There were no statistically significant associations of
cumulative marijuana use with changes per year in
eGFRcys between years 10–15 and 15–20 (Table 3). Among
the study cohort, 504 had experienced rapid decline in
eGFRcys in at least one interval between visits and 426 had
prevalent albuminuria. There were no statistically signif-
icant associations between the higher categories of cumu-
lative marijuana use and rapid eGFRcys decline or
prevalent albuminuria in multivariable-adjusted models
(Table 4).
The results were similar in exploratory analyses evalu-
ating cumulative marijuana use in joint-years. Higher
exposure in joint-years was associated with lower eGFRcys
at year 10, and the interaction with race was statistically
significant (P value for interaction ,0.01) (Supplemental
Table 2). Findings appeared similar for men and women
(P value for interaction=0.76). There was a statistically
significant interaction by tobacco smoking status (P value
,0.001), and among those with at least 10 joint-years of
use, we observed similar results for the analysis stratified
by tobacco smoking status as we did for marijuana-years.
There were no statistically significant associations between
the higher categories of joint-years and change in eGFRcys,
rapid eGFRcys decline, or prevalent albuminuria in the
multivariable-adjusted models (Supplemental Tables 3
and 4). In a sensitivity analysis using inverse probability of
censoring weighting, the associations of both marijuana-
years and joint-years with log-transformed eGFRcys at year
10 were similar in magnitude to those of the original
analyses (Supplemental Tables 5 and 6).
Discussion
In a large cohort of young adults with preserved eGFR
followed for up to 15 years, we found that greater
marijuana exposure was associated with worse eGFRcys
at year 10, but we did not detect an association between
marijuana use and subsequent change in eGFRcys, rapid
eGFRcys decline, or prevalent albuminuria. The magnitude
of the association with eGFRcys at year 10 was more
pronounced among whites than blacks and among never
or former smokers relative to current smokers.
To our knowledge, our study is the first to examine the
association between marijuana use and kidney function
in the general population. Previous literature is limited
to case reports of AKI associated with synthetic canna-
binoid use (25–27) and studies of small sample size and
relatively shorter duration. In a single-center study
investigating the effect of illicit drug use and kidney
function among hypertensive men (n=647), marijuana
users did not have a significantly higher risk of kidney
function decline (defined as an increase in serum creat-
inine of $0.6 mg/dl) over a median follow-up of 7 years
compared with nonusers (28). In a prospective cohort
study designed to assess the safety of marijuana use for
chronic noncancer pain, cannabis use for 1 year did not
significantly change serum creatinine among 78 users
(29). Finally, among kidney transplant recipients (n=1225),
marijuana use was not associated with death, graft failure,
or worse graft function at 1 year post-transplant (30).
Differences in study populations and methodology pre-
clude direct comparison of our results with those of pre-
vious studies.
The mechanisms underlying marijuana’s potential influ-
ence on kidney function are uncertain, but it is possible
that marijuana use could either acutely lower kidney
function or result in cumulative toxicity. The cannabinoid
receptor CB1 is expressed in various regions and cell types
within the kidneys of animals and humans; data regard-
ing the expression of CB2 receptors in the kidney are less

never used marijuana, the annualized change in eGFRcys relative to the value at the beginning of each 5-yr interval was smaller by 0.1%

 consistent (14). In normal rat kidneys, the endogenous
ligand anandamide, acting via CB1 receptors expressed in
afferent and efferent arterioles, decreased eGFR by pref-
erential vasodilation of the efferent arteriole, an effect that
was blocked by CB1 antagonists (40). Animal models
suggest that CB1 activity may be pathogenic, whereas CB2
activity may be reno-protective. In mouse and rat models
of diabetic and obesity-related nephropathy and kidney
fibrosis, CB1 antagonism and CB2 activation were associ-
ated with improved kidney parameters (e.g., reduced
albuminuria, proteinuria, and kidney fibrosis, and in-
creased creatinine clearance) (17–23), and CB2 antagonism
was associated with worsened kidney parameters (e.g.,
increased albuminuria, reduced creatinine clearance)
(23,24).
Our study has several limitations. We only observed an
association cross-sectionally but not longitudinally, which
may reflect greater susceptibility of cross-sectional analyses
to confounding due to unmeasured interindividual differ-
ences. Although we adjusted for a comprehensive list of
variables, it is possible that the associations we observed at
year 10 could be explained by confounding, such as by
smoking; tobacco use is common among marijuana users
(41) and has been associated with worse kidney function in
several reports (42–45). Additionally, our cohort consisted
of young adults with preserved eGFR, so rapid decline and
albuminuria were rare. Thus, our power to detect longi-
tudinal associations was limited, and we cannot exclude
benefit or harm for these outcomes.
Marijuana exposure was determined on the basis of
self-report, although misclassification should have been
mitigated by use of a self-administered questionnaire
and is unlikely to be differential according to outcome
status. We lacked the information to account for changes
in marijuana exposure (e.g., quality, composition) and
self-reporting that may have changed over time and may
vary by geographic location. Active marijuana use was
more common during the earlier years of follow-up
before kidney measures were available, so we were unable
to evaluate the influence of marijuana when its use was
maximal. We are also unable to discern whether current or
cumulative use was responsible for the association we
observed at year 10, and we cannot distinguish whether
this represents a transient or enduring effect. The
spectrum of marijuana use may also be biased toward
the moderate side because heavy users in the general
population may be less likely to participate in the
ongoing evaluations required of CARDIA participants.
Our results are not generalizable to older adults among
whom marijuana use has been increasing (1) and who
are at higher risk for adverse kidney outcomes (46). Finally,
we were unable to determine whether the larger associa-
tions of marijuana with lower eGFRcys among whites than
blacks reflect a true biologic difference or a chance finding.
However, investigation of whether marijuana has different
associations with eGFRcys across racial groups merits
further study.
Strengths of our study are the large sample size, long
duration of follow-up, and repeated assessments of mar-
ijuana use and kidney outcomes. We have reason to be
confident in the quality of our exposure measures given
that previous CARDIA papers have demonstrated robust
associations with other health outcomes (10,32) using the
same methods of assessing marijuana use.
Because marijuana use is becoming increasingly ac-
cepted in the United States (1), there is a critical need for
epidemiologic data to assess the risk-to-benefit ratio of a
substance that may be poised for more widespread use.
Although our findings were largely negative, we observed
that higher marijuana use was associated with modestly
lower eGFRcys among adults with preserved eGFR. This
result may not translate into a clinically meaningful differ-
ence and may be insufficient to inform decision-making
concerning marijuana use. However, it is possible that the
association could be stronger among patients with estab-
lished kidney disease, and additional research to define the
effect of marijuana use on kidney outcomes in other study
populations is warranted.
