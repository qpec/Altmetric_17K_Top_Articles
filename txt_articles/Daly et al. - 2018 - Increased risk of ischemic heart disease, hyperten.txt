Abstract
Background
Gestational diabetes mellitus (GDM) is associated with developing type 2 diabetes, but very
few studies have examined its effect on developing cardiovascular disease.
Methods and findings
We conducted a retrospective cohort study utilizing a large primary care database in the
United Kingdom. From 1 February 1990 to 15 May 2016, 9,118 women diagnosed with
GDM were identified and randomly matched with 37,281 control women by age and timing
of pregnancy (up to 3 months). Adjusted incidence rate ratios (IRRs) with 95% confidence
intervals (CIs) were calculated for cardiovascular risk factors and cardiovascular disease.
Women with GDM were more likely to develop type 2 diabetes (IRR = 21.96; 95% CI 18.31–
26.34) and hypertension (IRR = 1.85; 95% CI 1.59–2.16) after adjusting for age, Townsend
(deprivation) quintile, body mass index, and smoking. For ischemic heart disease (IHD), the
IRR was 2.78 (95% CI 1.37–5.66), and for cerebrovascular disease 0.95 (95% CI 0.51–
1.77; p-value = 0.87), after adjusting for the above covariates and lipid-lowering medication
and hypertension at baseline. Follow-up screening for type 2 diabetes and cardiovascular
risk factors was poor. Limitations include potential selective documentation of severe GDM
for women in primary care, higher surveillance for outcomes in women diagnosed with GDM

outcomes.
Author summary
Why was this study done?
• The prevalence of gestational diabetes mellitus (GDM) is increasing rapidly in most
developed countries.
• Although it is well documented that women diagnosed with GDM have a greatly
increased lifetime risk of developing type 2 diabetes, there is a paucity of reports on its
association with cardiovascular disease.
• Only 3 previous population-based cohort studies have reported on GDM and the long-
term risk of cardiovascular events (including 1 utilizing a primary care database), and
no studies have been reported from the United Kingdom (UK).
What did the researchers do and find?
• This population-based retrospective cohort study utilized a large UK primary care data-
base that included more than 9,000 women diagnosed with GDM between 1 February
1990 and 15 May 2016.
• The association between GDM and the development of type 2 diabetes, hypertension,
and cardiovascular disease postpartum was examined.
• Women diagnosed with GDM were over 20 times more likely to develop type 2 diabetes,
2.8 times more likely to develop ischemic heart disease, and twice as likely to develop
hypertension, although no association was found for cerebrovascular disease.
• Less than 60% of women diagnosed with GDM were screened in primary care for type 2
diabetes in the first year postpartum, and the proportion screened rapidly declined after
this period.
• Screening rates were also low for cardiovascular risk factors such as smoking, high body
mass index, hypertension, and dyslipidemia, and were similar to the screening rates in
control women.
What do these findings mean?
• GDM in women increases the risk for hypertension and ischemic heart disease in addi-
tion to type 2 diabetes.

 • Although the National Institute for Health and Care Excellence guidelines recommend
annual screening for type 2 diabetes in women diagnosed with GDM, this study found
that follow-up screening was poor for type 2 diabetes and other cardiovascular risk fac-
tors such as hypertension.
• Women diagnosed with GDM are an identifiable group of at-risk women and ideal for
targeting preventative metabolic and cardiovascular interventions.
• Clinical guidelines should include postpartum screening and management for all car-
diovascular risk factors in women diagnosed with GDM and not restrict it to diabetes.
Introduction
Gestational diabetes mellitus (GDM) is increasing, largely due to the obesity epidemic [1] and
increasing maternal age [2]. Although inconsistencies exist across countries for screening for
GDM [1] and diagnostic cutoff points for the oral glucose tolerance test [3], reported preva-
lences are 2%–6% for Europe [1], 7% for North America [4], and 1%–9% and 4%–24% for
white British and South Asian (SA) women, respectively, in England and Southern Ireland [5],
reflecting the higher 10%–20% prevalence in high-risk populations [2]. It is well accepted that
the early identification and treatment of women with GDM reduces pregnancy and perinatal
complications [1,6,7] and improves infant birth weights [8]. Women with GDM are also more
likely to have markers for insulin resistance and beta cell dysfunction [9–13], particularly if
overweight [14], and GDM is a well-established predictor for progression to type 2 diabetes
and carries up to a 70% lifetime risk [15].
Although the association between GDM and type 2 diabetes is well established [15,16],
onset of the latter following delivery is less well documented and understood in terms of
underlying genetic and lifestyle factors [16]. Only 3 previous large population-based studies
quantifying the increased risk of cardiovascular disease following delivery in women diag-
nosed with GDM were identified [17–19]. One Canadian retrospective study identified 8,191
women with GDM and age-matched them with 81,262 control women without GDM utilizing
primary care records in Ontario [17]. One French study utilizing hospital records identified
over 1.5 million women who delivered infants during 2007 and 2008 and included 62,958
women with GDM who were compared with all women without GDM who delivered a healthy
infant during that period [18]. More recently, the North American Nurses’ Health Study II
group reported on 5,992 nurses who self-reported a history of GDM from a total cohort of
89,479 [19].
All 3 studies reported an increase risk of cardiovascular events for women with GDM com-
pared with women without GDM during the 12, 7, and 26 years of postpartum follow-up for
the 3 studies, respectively. The increased risk for major cardiovascular events in people with
type 2 diabetes in addition to other traditional risk factors [15,20] and at an early age [21]
is well documented. Despite this, and the recommendation for annual screening for type 2 dia-
betes in women diagnosed with GDM [22] and evidence that lifestyle changes can improve
outcomes [23], there is a paucity of reports on screening, and low rates have been reported
[24,25]. The current National Institute for Health and Care Excellence (NICE) guidelines rec-
ommend screening for type 2 diabetes (between 6 and 13 weeks postpartum and an annual gly-
cated hemoglobin [HbA1c] test) and lifestyle changes (weight control, diet, and exercise) for

 women diagnosed with GDM [26]. There is no recommendation to screen, identify, and
actively manage cardiovascular risk factors (including hypertension, dyslipidemia, and smok-
ing) in women diagnosed with GDM in the postpartum period in the current 2015 NICE
guidelines [26].
The aim of this current study is to examine the risk of cardiovascular disease in women pre-
viously diagnosed with GDM in a population that is representative of all women diagnosed
with GDM in the United Kingdom (UK). In addition, the proportion of women assessed for
cardiovascular risk factors in the first 3 years postpartum in primary care will be documented.
The results are expected to assist general practice in identifying and targeting cardiovascular
risk factors in a group of relatively young women at high risk of long-term metabolic and car-
diovascular disorders.
Methods
The study protocol was approved by the Scientific Review Committee (SRC Reference Num-
ber: 17THIN001) of the data provider, IQVIA.
Research design
A retrospective cohort study design was used to compare long-term cardiometabolic outcomes
in women diagnosed with GDM and randomly matched pregnant control women not diag-
nosed with GDM, utilizing The Health Improvement Network (THIN) database—following
the pre-analysis study plan (S1 Text). This database captures electronically recorded medical
records in primary care and is designed to encourage research and improve healthcare delivery
in the UK [27]. Over 675 general practices contribute to the THIN database, which captures
about 6% (3.6 million) of the total registered population [27], is representative of the age struc-
ture of the UK population, and is made up predominantly of a white British, Welch, and Irish
population (94% in 1991 although decreasing to 86% by 2011) [28]. Patient information is
entered into the Vision patient record software, which uses Read code data (version 2) [29],
rather than the World Health Organization International Classification of Diseases designed
for hospital records. The Vision software also captures all British National Formulary drug
prescription records [30]. General practices that had electronic medical record software for at
least 1 year and had an acceptable mortality recording for at least 12 months were included in
the analyses to ensure data quality and that all important covariates were recorded.
Study population
All records for women who became pregnant between 1 February 1990 and 15 May 2016 and
were aged less than 50 years were accessed for possible inclusion in the study. Women diag-
nosed with GDM prior to delivery were identified and randomly matched with up to 4 preg-
nant control women without GDM by age and timing of entry of a code for pregnancy (up to
3 months).
The primary outcomes were the clinical diagnosis of coronary artery disease (ischemic heart
disease [IHD]) and cerebrovascular disease (stroke or transient ischemic attack [TIA]). Second-
ary outcomes were cases of incident hypertension and type 2 diabetes. Outcomes were identi-
fied through clinical codes (S1 Data). Recording of diabetes, hypertension, and cardiovascular
disease is considered accurate in UK primary care because there is a mandatory requirement
for maintaining a register for these conditions, and incentive payments are made for identifica-
tion and management of these cardiometabolic outcomes [31].
Women with a diagnosis of the outcome of interest prior to baseline (i.e., index date: at
diagnosis of GDM for cases and confirmation of pregnancy for control women) were not

 included in the analysis for that outcome. All potential and available risk factors for all out-
comes of interest (Townsend quintile, smoking, and body mass index [BMI]) and confound-
ing variables (hypertension and lipid-lowering medication at baseline for IHD and stroke or
TIA) were extracted for each of the women included in the study to adjust for confounding.
Patient involvement
Patients were not involved in the design of this research project, in conducting the study, or in
preparing results or reports. In acknowledgment of the patients and general practices that con-
tributed information to the THIN dataset, the published paper will be circulated via IQVIA to
all current practices that contribute to the dataset.
Statistical analyses
Characteristics of women with GDM and matched control women in the cohort were reported
using appropriate descriptive statistics (mean and median for continuous variables and pro-
portions for categorical variables). Incidence rate ratios (IRRs) and 95% confidence intervals
(CIs) were calculated using the Poisson regression model, offsetting the exposure for person-
years of follow-up. Adjusted IRRs were constructed by including age, BMI, Townsend quintile
(a measure of deprivation), and smoking status in the Poisson models for hypertension and
diabetes outcomes. In addition to these covariates, baseline hypertension and lipid-lowering
medication prescription were included in the models for cardiovascular disease outcomes.
BMI (in kg/m2) was treated as a categorical variable and grouped into <25, 25 to 30, and >30
kg/m2, based on the World Health Organization BMI categories [32].
Missing data for BMI, Townsend quintile, and smoking were included in the regression
model as a missing categorical variable. We did not include ethnicity in our primary analysis
because of poor recording in the primary care setting (<50%). However, in a sensitivity analy-
sis, we included the available recording of ethnicity along with a missing category in the model
to assess its impact on findings. Statistical significance was set at 0.05. Cumulative incidence
curves were generated utilizing the cumulative incidence function of the survival curves. In
addition, we report on the proportions of women with GDM and control women who were
screened in the subsequent 3 years postpartum for smoking, BMI, diabetes, hypertension, and
dyslipidemia. All analyses were conducted using STATA 14.0 [33].
Results
A total of 9,118 women with GDM (based on an electronic code entry for GDM) were identified
in the dataset. Table 1 outlines the demographic characteristics of the women diagnosed with
GDM compared with pregnant control women (matched by age and timing of pregnancy) at
baseline. Mean age at the time of delivery was 33 years and ranged from 14 to 47 years. A signifi-
cantly greater proportion of women with GDM compared with controls were from economi-
cally deprived areas (Townsend quintile 4 or 5), were overweight or obese (BMI � 25 kg/m2,
63% compared with 35%), and had been diagnosed with hypertension (including 2.5% prior to
pregnancy), but women with GDM were less likely to be current smokers (16% versus 19%).
The follow-up period varied from less than 1 to 25 years (median 2.9 years). There was a high
proportion of SA women (17.1%) among those with a recording for ethnicity in the GDM
cohort. Fig 1 outlines the sampling frame for the total number of pregnant women, those diag-
nosed with GDM, and control women matched by age and time of pregnancy.
Table 2 shows that women diagnosed with GDM were over 20 times more likely to develop
type 2 diabetes (IRR = 21.96; 95% CI 18.31–26.34; p-value < 0.001) and had almost a 2-fold
higher risk of developing hypertension (IRR = 1.85; 95% CI 1.59–2.16; p-value < 0.001) after

 adjusting for age, Townsend quintile, BMI, and smoking compared with control women. Fur-
ther, after controlling for baseline lipid-lowering medication and hypertension in addition to
the above covariates, women with GDM were more than 2.5 times more likely to develop IHD
(IRR = 2.78; 95% CI 1.37–5.66; p-value = 0.005), but no increase in risk was found for cerebro-
vascular disease (IRR = 0.95; 95% CI 0.51–1.77; p-value = 0.87). Of the 14 women with GDM
who developed IHD, only 5 also developed type 2 diabetes in the postpartum period, suggest-
ing that the risk of cardiovascular disease is not always mediated through type 2 diabetes.
Fig 2 shows that the cumulative incidence of type 2 diabetes, hypertension, and IHD was
higher for women with GDM compared with control women and that this difference persisted
throughout the 25-year study period. The increased risk was specific for type 2 diabetes, hyper-
tension, and IHD but not for stroke or TIA.

 The sensitivity analysis that included ethnicity in the model did not significantly alter the
effect sizes for any of the outcomes: IRR for type 2 diabetes = 21.08 (95% CI 17.57–25.30), IRR
for hypertension = 1.82 (95% CI 1.56–2.13), IRR for IHD = 2.72 (95% CI 1.33–5.60), and IRR
for stroke or TIA = 0.91 (95% CI 0.48–1.70). In an analysis restricted to women with GDM, SA
women were twice as likely (IRR = 2.09; 95% CI 1.52–2.85) as white women to develop type 2
diabetes, and Afro-Caribbean (AC) women were 1.6 times more likely (IRR = 1.65; 95% CI
1.05–2.62). There was no increased risk for hypertension in AC women (IRR = 1.35; 95% CI
0.60–3.02) or SA women (IRR = 0.85; 95% CI 0.41–1.77) with GDM compared with white
women with GDM. Ethnic subgroup analysis showed that white, AC, and SA women with
GDM were at higher risk of developing type 2 diabetes than women without GDM, with IRR
(95% CI) values of 35.2 (20.0–58.5), 22.15 (6.42–76.4) and 15.40 (6.54–36.25), respectively.
Similar analyses for other outcomes were not possible due to the small number of outcomes
among the relatively small number of women from the 2 minority ethnic groups.
Medical records for women with GDM showed that only 58% had some form of glycemic
measurement in the first year following delivery (Table 3). Although 62% of women with
GDM were tested after 1 January 2010, per the original 2008 NICE guideline publication rec-
ommending screening for type 2 diabetes [34], this proportion was not markedly different
from the 53% tested prior to 2010. In the second and third year following delivery, the propor-
tion with glycemic measurement decreased to less than 40%, and 24% of women did not have
any glycemic measurement in the first 3 years postpartum. No difference was noted in the pro-
portion of women with GDM who had blood pressure measured and recorded prior to and
from 2010, with about 80% in the first year following delivery and declining to around 50% in
the subsequent 2 years. BMI was recorded for almost half of women with GDM in the first
year following delivery, decreasing to about a third in the subsequent 2 years, and did not
change following the original guideline publication. Smoking status was recorded for 46% of
women in the first year following delivery, and although this proportion declined in the second
and third year, 73% had at least 1 record over this 3-year period. Lipid profiles were the most
poorly recorded for women with GDM in the 3 years following delivery. Only 28% and 23% of
women had any serum cholesterol or triglyceride level, respectively, recorded in this 3-year
period.
In the control population, surveillance for risk factors in the postpartum period was com-
paratively lower than for women diagnosed with GDM across all assessments in year 1, and

 this difference persisted for type 2 diabetes and lipid measurements in years 2 and 3. In con-
trast, the proportion assessed for hypertension and smoking in years 2 and 3 did not differ
between control women and women diagnosed with GDM. In a sensitivity analysis limited to
patients who did not develop hypertension in the first year and were followed-up for more
than 1 year, the increased risk for hypertension persisted (hazard ratio [HR] = 1.87; 95% CI
1.57–2.24), suggesting that surveillance bias did not affect this outcome.
Discussion
This is, to our knowledge, the first large population-based study in the UK that reports on the
increased risk of cardiovascular disease in women diagnosed with GDM, and quantifies the
high incidence of type 2 diabetes and hypertension for these women in the postpartum period.
Women diagnosed with GDM were over 20 times more likely to develop type 2 diabetes, had

 IHD in the postpartum period compared with control women. The increased risk persisted
throughout the 25-year follow-up period. Despite the high risk of developing type 2 diabetes
and cardiovascular disease, postpartum screening was poor, with less than 60% of women
undergoing any type of screening test for diabetes in the 12 months following delivery and
with the proportion declining to below 40% in the second year. Further, only half of the
women with GDM had their blood pressure recorded in the second year following delivery.
About a third had smoking status recorded, and very few women had lipids recorded, in the
third year postpartum. The only improvement noted following publication of the 2008 NICE
guidelines [34] was in any form of measurement for glycemia, and this improvement was only
moderate.
Our findings are broadly consistent with the French study utilizing hospital records, the
Canadian study utilizing primary care records, and the Nurses’ Health Study II using self-
reported diagnosis of GDM. The French study reported a higher adjusted odds ratio (OR) for
hypertension (2.72; 95% CI 2.58–2.88) than our study’s IRR, but a lower adjusted OR for car-
diovascular outcomes that included angina pectoris (1.68; 95% CI 1.29–2.20) and myocardial
infarction (1.92; 95% CI 1.36–2.71). Similar to our finding, the French study reported no effect
for stroke [18]. The Canadian study reported an attenuated effect (HR = 2.09; 95% CI 1.19–
3.67) for the development of coronary artery disease [17]. A significant but lower effect size
was reported for the Nurses’ Health Study II for myocardial infarction (HR = 1.56; 95% CI
1.09–2.23) compared with our study, and no effect for stroke (HR = 1.22; 95% CI 0.80–1.86).

 In addition, a large Swedish case–control study also utilizing hospital records reported an
increased risk of cardiovascular events (OR = 1.51; 95% CI 1.07–2.14) and hypertension
(OR = 5.10; 95% CI 3.18–8.18) for women previously diagnosed with GDM compared with
control women who had not had a cardiovascular event prior to the matched pregnancy and
without a history of GDM [35]. Smaller studies have also shown associations between GDM
and hypertension and cardiovascular disease in women with a family history of type 2 diabetes
[36], and a higher risk of hypertension for Hispanic compared with white North American
women diagnosed with GDM [37].
The increased incidence of type 2 diabetes for women with GDM found in our study is con-
sistent with previous studies. Despite this, the incidence in this study was far higher than that
reported in a review of observational studies (relative risk = 7.43, 95% CI 4.79–11.51) that also
reported an increased risk after 5 years compared with the first 5 years postpartum [16]. How-
ever, the high incidence of type 2 diabetes in the first few years postpartum found in this cur-
rent study was similar to findings in an older review that reported a higher cumulative
incidence in the first 5 years postpartum than in subsequent years, after adjusting for cohort
retention [15].
Historically, follow-up screening for type 2 diabetes in women diagnosed with GDM is
poor in the postpartum period [38]. This study shows that fewer than 60% of women with dia-
betes in pregnancy were screened for type 2 diabetes, and far fewer had smoking status or lip-
ids recorded, in the first year following delivery. Blood pressure recordings also decreased
from 80% in the first year to 50% in the second year following delivery. The current 2015
NICE guidelines recommend annual screening for diabetes and lifestyle advice on “weight
control, diet and exercise” for all women diagnosed with GDM [26]. However, there is no rec-
ommendation for screening and management of cardiovascular risk factors such as hyperten-
sion, dyslipidemia, or tobacco use following delivery in this group of high-risk women. In
addition to enhancing early identification of type 2 diabetes, targeting this group also ensures
that women know of their increased risk, which is important to them [39], and presents an
opportunity to provide education and support for the lifestyle changes required to improve
long-term outcomes [9,11], although there is currently a lack of evidence on exactly how to
achieve this [40].
The study has several limitations. Our study captured women with GDM only if the condi-
tion was documented in the primary care medical records. Our estimates suggest we may have
only captured around 49% of women with GDM in the THIN database (S1 Table). Selective
documentation of women with more severe GDM may have resulted in an overestimation of
the effect size, while any women with GDM misclassified in the control population may have
resulted in an underestimation of the effect size. Though overall our findings are consistent
with previous studies, the effect estimates for diabetes and IHD were higher than the estimates
observed in other studies, while effect estimates were lower for hypertension and similar for
stroke. Moreover, women with GDM may have underreported the use of tobacco during preg-
nancy as they were more likely to be overweight and to live in economically deprived areas,
both of which are strongly associated with tobacco use in pregnancy [41]. A previous review of
observational studies also found no association between smoking and GDM [42].
The timing and frequency of diabetes-related screening tests during and after pregnancy
varied, potentially leading to a nondifferential error, with more women with GDM being diag-
nosed with diabetes and hypertension. Higher frequency of blood pressure measurements in
the GDM population was noted only in year 1 of follow-up. When limiting our analysis to
women without hypertension in the first year postpartum and with follow-up recordings
beyond 1 year, the effect sizes remained the same for hypertension. Surveillance bias is less
likely to affect outcomes that are symptomatic such as IHD and stroke. Further, there is limited

 information on baseline characteristics such as ethnicity and the number and order of preg-
nancies, limiting further in-depth analyses on factors that modify each of the outcomes. In par-
ticular, not sufficiently controlling for ethnicity might have resulted in an overestimation of
the risk of type 2 diabetes in women with previous GDM, but this overestimation is likely to be
small considering that the majority of women in the UK over the study period were white [28].
Additional limitations include the short median follow-up period, resulting in few women
diagnosed with cardiovascular disease, and possible misclassification of outcome data related
to the Read codes, which, although are ideally suited for general practice, are not always accu-
rate. However, the outcomes are expected to be reported as part of the Quality and Outcomes
Framework and have been shown to be reliable [43].
Despite these limitations, this study is, to our knowledge, the first UK and the largest popu-
lation-based study of women with GDM utilizing primary care records to report on incidence
of cardiovascular disease not requiring a hospital admission [17]. The findings add an impor-
tant insight into the trajectory of the development of type 2 diabetes, hypertension, and cardio-
vascular disease in the early and later postpartum periods. Findings are consistent with
previous reports on the risk of developing type 2 diabetes and cardiovascular disease. Further-
more, the findings report on a large population and identify an at-risk group of relatively
young women ideally suited for targeting of risk factor management to improve long-term
metabolic and cardiovascular outcomes. Targeting these high-risk women may also provide
better value for money for prevention programs, as they are already known to general practice.
While the value of preventing cardiovascular outcomes requires further studies, there is some
evidence that targeting this subgroup of women may yield benefits in reducing conversion to
type 2 diabetes [44].
Conclusion
Results showed that women diagnosed with GDM were significantly more likely to develop
type 2 diabetes, hypertension, and IHD at a relatively young age compared with women with-
out a previous diagnosis of GDM. The risk was greatest for type 2 diabetes in the first year fol-
lowing delivery and persisted for 25 years. Follow-up screening for type 2 diabetes was poor,
with less than 60% of women with GDM undergoing screening in the first year following deliv-
ery, and the proportion decreased to less than 40% by the second year. Guideline recommen-
dations for screening and management of hypertension, lipids, and smoking cessation are
lacking and need to be reviewed.
