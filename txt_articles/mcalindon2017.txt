IMPORTANCE Synovitis is common and is associated with progression of structural
characteristics of knee osteoarthritis. Intra-articular corticosteroids could reduce cartilage
damage associated with synovitis but might have adverse effects on cartilage and
periarticular bone.
OBJECTIVE To determine the effects of intra-articular injection of 40 mg of triamcinolone
acetonide every 3 months on progression of cartilage loss and knee pain.
DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS Two-year, randomized, placebo-controlled,
double-blind trial of intra-articular triamcinolone vs saline for symptomatic knee
osteoarthritis with ultrasonic features of synovitis in 140 patients. Mixed-effects regression
models with a random intercept were used to analyze the longitudinal repeated outcome
measures. Patients fulfilling the American College of Rheumatology criteria for symptomatic
knee osteoarthritis, Kellgren-Lawrence grades 2 or 3, were enrolled at Tufts Medical Center
beginning February 11, 2013; all patients completed the study by January 1, 2015.
INTERVENTIONS Intra-articular triamcinolone (n = 70) or saline (n = 70) every 12 weeks
for 2 years.
MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES Annual knee magnetic resonance imaging for quantitative
evaluation of cartilage volume (minimal clinically important difference not yet defined), and
Western Ontario and McMaster Universities Osteoarthritis index collected every 3 months
(Likert pain subscale range, 0 [no pain] to 20 [extreme pain]; minimal clinically important
improvement, 3.94).
RESULTS Among 140 randomized patients (mean age, 58 [SD, 8] years, 75 women [54%]),
119 (85%) completed the study. Intra-articular triamcinolone resulted in significantly greater
cartilage volume loss than did saline for a mean change in index compartment cartilage
thickness of −0.21 mm vs −0.10 mm (between-group difference, −0.11 mm; 95% CI, −0.20 to
−0.03 mm); and no significant difference in pain (−1.2 vs −1.9; between-group difference,
−0.6; 95% CI, −1.6 to 0.3). The saline group had 3 treatment-related adverse events
compared with 5 in the triamcinolone group and had a small increase in hemoglobin A1c levels
(between-group difference, −0.2%; 95% CI, −0.5% to −0.007%).
CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE Among patients with symptomatic knee osteoarthritis,
2 years of intra-articular triamcinolone, compared with intra-articular saline, resulted in
significantly greater cartilage volume loss and no significant difference in knee pain. These
findings do not support this treatment for patients with symptomatic knee osteoarthritis.

S
ymptomatic knee osteoarthritis was estimated to affect
more than 9 million individuals in the United States in
20051 and is a leading cause of disability and medical
costs,2 most of which were attributable to arthroplasty.3 Treat-
ments for osteoarthritis are primarily prescribed to reduce
symptoms, with no interventions known to influence struc-
tural progression.
Evidence suggests that osteoarthritis is an inflammatory
condition. Studies demonstrated the presence of synovitis in
osteoarthritic joints accompanied by mononuclear cells and
proinflammatory mediators with up-regulation of aggreca-
nases and collagenases.4 Clinical and epidemiological stud-
ies found that inflammation is common in the knee joints of
people with knee osteoarthritis and associated with progres-
sion of cartilage damage.5-7 These observations suggest that
suppression of inflammatory processes by corticosteroids
(already in widespread clinical use for knee osteoarthritis8)
might reduce progression of knee osteoarthritis. This possi-
bility is supported by interventional studies in animal mod-
els of osteoarthritis.9 However, associations of intra-articular
corticosteroids with adverse joint outcomes in some obser-
vational studies involving people with osteoarthritis,10,11
together with their known antianabolic effects on healthy
cartilage,12 have raised questions about their potential to
damage joints. A 2-year clinical trial suggested that there
were no adverse effects associated with intra-articular
corticosteroids13 but was limited because radiography was
used to evaluate osteoarthritis progression. Radiography is
insensitive to osteoarthritis progression and does not
directly image critical soft-tissue structures or bone marrow
lesions.14 Therefore, a 2-year clinical trial of repeated intra-
articular triamcinolone injections was performed to test the
benefits and harms of intra-articular corticosteroids in the
treatment of knee osteoarthritis, using magnetic resonance
imaging (MRI) to evaluate articular structures.
Methods
Overview
This was a 2-year double-blind clinical trial of intra-articular
triamcinolone administered every 3 months vs saline for
symptomatic knee osteoarthritis with ultrasonic evidence
of synovitis. Outcomes were cartilage loss, articular struc-
tural damage, pain, and physical function. The study was
performed at Tufts Medical Center between June 2011 and
January 2015. It was approved by the Institutional Review
Board of Tufts Medical Center. (The study protocol is avail-
able in Supplement 1.) Adaptive interim monitoring was ini-
tially planned but this approach was removed in March 2014
with the approval of the data and safety monitoring board
when it became apparent that its disadvantages outweighed
any advantages.
Sample
Patients were recruited through clinics and local advertise-
ments. Telephone-administered prescreening was con-
ducted before scheduling an on-site visit that included knee
radiographs and blood tests. All participants provided writ-
teninformedconsent.Self-reportedrace/ethnicityandsexwere
collected.
Eligibility criteria included age 45 years or older and
presence of knee osteoarthritis defined by the American
College of Rheumatology classification criteria.15 These cri-
teria are based on a standardized question about knee
pain,16 and tibiofemoral osteoarthritis evident on postero-
anterior weight-bearing semi-flexed radiographs. Eligibility
thresholds were placed for knee pain (score, ≥2 but ≤8 on
the weight-bearing questions of the Western Ontario and
McMaster Universities [WOMAC]17 pain subscale, range
0-12) and radiographic severity (Kellgren-Lawrence [KL]17
grade, 2 or 3). Potential participants had a clinical examina-
tion confirming pain from the knee joint and had to be will-
ing to discontinue their analgesic medication for 48 hours
before each pain assessment. Eligibility criteria included
ultrasonographic evidence of effusion synovitis in the study
knee, defined according to established protocols by a supra-
patellar pouch depth larger than 2 mm.18 Ultrasonographic
detection of effusion and synovitis is well-validated,19,20
and each is associated with prevalent and incident knee
osteoarthritis.21,22 Exclusion criteria included other disor-
ders affecting the study joint, such as systemic inflamma-
tory joint disease, prior sepsis, osteonecrosis; chronic or
recent use of oral corticosteroids, doxycycline, indometha-
cin, glucosamine, or chondroitin; recent (<3 months) intra-
articular corticosteroids or hyaluronic acid; serious medical
conditions (like uncontrolled diabetes, HIV infection, or
hypertension) that could be contraindications to participa-
tion; and any contraindication to undergoing an MRI scan.
Randomization
Randomized treatment assignments were computer gener-
ated by the study statistician (M.L.) using SAS software and
provided to the research pharmacy at Tufts Medical Center.
The randomization was stratified by KL grade and sex, with
1:1 assignments permuted in blocks of 4. The investigative
team and participants were blinded to group assignment.
Study Intervention
The active medication was 1 mL of triamcinolone (purchased
from Bristol-Myers Squibb), 40 mg/mL, for injection. The
Key Points
Question What are the effects of intra-articular injection of 40 mg
of triamcinolone acetonide every 3 months on progression of
cartilage loss and knee pain in patients with osteoarthritis?
Findings In a randomized clinical trial of 140 patients with
symptomatic knee osteoarthritis, the use of intra-articular
triamcinolone compared with intra-articular saline resulted in
greater cartilage volume loss. There was no significant difference
on knee pain severity between treatment groups.
Meaning Among patients with symptomatic knee osteoarthritis,
intra-articular triamcinolone, compared with intra-articular saline,
increased cartilage volume loss and had no effect on knee pain
over 2 years.

comparator was 1 mL of 0.9% sodium chloride for injection
(Hosperia Inc). Neither was mixed with local anesthetic. Both
were administered every 12 weeks for 2 years. Synovial fluid
(≤10 mL) was aspirated prior to the injection.
Toxicity Monitoring and Safety Procedures
At each visit, information on adverse effects was collected,
vital signs obtained, including standard measurement
of blood pressure, and blood was obtained for the hemoglo-
bin A1c (HbA1c) assay. Knee MRI scans were screened for
avascular necrosis or subchondral fracture. Oversight of
treatment-specific results was provided by a National Insti-
tute of Arthritis and Musculoskeletal and Skin Disease–
appointed data and safety monitoring board, which met in
closed sessions.
Masking of Treatment Assignment
The research pharmacist prefilled the syringes and masked
the contents using opacified labels and 3-way stopcock.
Ultrasound guidance was used for the injection, but, after
placement of the needle, the probe was removed to prevent
visualization of medication. The clinician who performed
the injections was not involved with outcome assessments
in the study.
Concomitant Analgesic Use
Participants were asked to discontinue concomitant analge-
sics 2 days before each assessment to avoid masking symp-
toms of pain. Participants were advised to take acetamino-
phen only if needed.
Study Assessments
Following the screening visit, there were 9 visits scheduled
at 3-month intervals over the 24-month period. Assess-
ments included a knee examination; blood pressure mea-
surement; WOMAC version 3.1 questionnaire (pain subscale
range, 0 [no pain]-20 [extreme pain]; minimal clinically
important improvement was a 3.94-difference in pain score;
the stiffness subscale range, 0 [no stiffness]-8 [extreme
stiffness]; function subscale range, 0 [no difficulty with
daily activities]-68 [extreme difficulty], minimal clinically
important improvement was a 6.66-difference in score)23;
global knee pain assessment (range, 0 [no pain]-100
[extreme pain]), adverse event ascertainment; medication
review; and serum HbA1c levels. Objective measures of func-
tioning tests (timed 20-m walk and chair-stand test) every 6
months, and the 36-Item Short Form Health Survey (SF-36)
were collected at baseline and at 12 and 24 months.
Standardized semiflexed posteroanterior knee ra-
diographs24 and knee and hip dual x-ray absorptiometry
(Lunar Prodigy Scanner, General Electric) were performed
at baseline. Radiographs were used to classify the index
compartment (knee compartment with greatest joint
space narrowing), and malalignment, according to estab-
lished methods.25 In cases that both compartments had
equal joint space narrowing, the medial compartment was
used. The readers were blinded to treatment assignment but
not to sequence.
Knee Joint Ultrasonography
Knees were scanned according to a standardized protocol19
in the longitudinal plane with the joint in 30° flexion using
a LOGIQe Ultrasound machine and a 13.0-MHz transducer
(both by General Electric).
Magnetic Resonance Imaging
Participants underwent MRI scans at months 0, 12, and
24 (Achieva X-Series 3.0 Tesla scanner, Philips) operat-
ing sequences as follows: (1) for cartilage volume,
3-dimensional sagittal gradient echo with cartilage excita-
tion, 3D_WATSc_SENSE: parallel imaging in right-left and
anterior-posterior; recovery time, 20 ms; echo time, 7.6 ms;
and field of view, 160 × 160 × 120 mm; matrix, 512 × 512;
voxel size, 0.3 × 0.3 × 1.0 mm; flip angle, 12°; (2) for trabec-
ular fast-field echo sequence, 3-dimensional T1 fast-field

MRI Quantitative Cartilage Analysis
Mean cartilage thickness was computed across prespec-
ified MRI cross-sectional images segmented in each of the
knee compartments according to previously developed
methods.26,27 This had good reproducibility (intratester
intraclass coefficient [ICC], 0.96-0.98; intertester ICC,
0.89-0.94). A validated volumetric cartilage damage index
was also used to quantitate cartilage damage.26,27 This
method was shown to have good reproducibility (intertester
reliability, 0.86-0.95; intratester reliability, 0.94-0.99) and
construct validity in relation to other measures of osteoar-
thritis severity (ie, KL grade, joint space narrowing, joint
space width).26,27
Bone Marrow Lesion and Effusion Volume Measurement
A validated semiautomated approach26 was used to measure
bone marrow lesion volume using the sagittal proton
density fat–suppressed images (intratester reliability,
>0.90).28,29 Effusion volume was measured using thresh-
olds with predefined perimeters based on anatomic land-
marks on the sagittal proton density fat–suppressed knee
images. Intratester reliability was good for effusion-synovitis
volume (0.81).
Semiquantitative Assessment of Cartilage Damage
One reader (J.B.D.) evaluated MRIs for cartilaginous in-
trasubstance signal change, denudation, fissures, delamina-
tion, and superficial fibrillations, defined as fraying of
the articular surface that appeared as a fine velvety surface
or an indistinct articular margin.30 The intrareader agree-
ment was good with a prevalence and bias-adjusted κ for
progression of intrasubstance signal change of 0.80 and
0.55 for denudation. Fissures, delamination, and superficial
fibrillations were uncommon. When present, these were
reviewed with a musculoskeletal radiologist (R.J.W.) to
reach consensus.
Analytic Plan
Coprimary outcomes were change in knee cartilage volume
in the index compartment, assessed using cartilage thick-
ness, and change in pain, assessed using the WOMAC pain
subscale. All other outcomes were secondary and consid-
ered exploratory. Intention-to-treat analyses were used for
all outcomes. Multiple imputation using the fully condi-
tional specification method was performed to fill in missing
values for the outcomes. For structural outcomes, KL grade,
sex, age, self-reported race/ethnicity, and baseline and non-
missing values of the outcomes from other measurement
points were used to impute missing values by treatment
group. Pain and function outcomes were imputed similarly
but with the addition of analgesia for breakthrough pain
and without age. All analysis models were adjusted for ran-
domization stratification factors of KL grade and sex. The
pain and function outcomes were also adjusted for use of
analgesia. Mixed-effects regression models were used with
a random intercept for longitudinal repeated measures.
Acetaminophen use was analyzed using logistic regression
with the generalized estimating equations correction for
repeated measures. All analyses were performed using SAS
version 9.4 (SAS Institute Inc). All testing was 2-sided with
P values <.05 considered significant. No adjustment was
made for multiple comparisons.
Sample Size Calculation
Based on the original adaptive trial design and allowing
for a 25% dropout rate, enrollment of 70 participants per
group was selected to allow 80% power to detect a treat-
ment difference of 90 mm3 in change cartilage volume over
2 years. There is no established minimally clinically impor-
tant difference for cartilage volume loss. However, this cor-
responds to an effect size of 0.4 SDs using an anticipated
SD of 224 mm3 as previously observed.31 This number also
provided 80% power to detect a treatment difference of
2.3 units in WOMAC pain (range, 0-20) with an anticipated
SD of 4.1.

Results
One hundred forty participants (70 to each group) were ran-
domized from 445 in-person screening visits (Figure 1). The
group assigned to receive triamcinolone injections was
slightly older (Table 1) but otherwise comparable in demo-
graphic and clinical characteristics with the group random-
ized to receive saline injections (Table 1 and Table 2). Fifty-
nine patients (84%) in the triamcinolone group and 60
(86%) in the saline group completed the final visit, with 990
of the possible 1120 intra-articular injections (88%) adminis-
tered. In the mixed-model analyses, 408 imputations were
made for structural outcomes (ie, 12% of 3360 possible data
points). Adherence to washout protocol was 99%; use of
medication for breakthrough pain was 7%.
The rate of cartilage loss in the index compartment was
greater in the triamcinolone group for cartilage thickness
(−0.21 vs –0.10 mm; between-group difference, −0.11 mm;
95% CI, −0.20 to −0.03 mm), and for the secondary cartilage
damage index (mean change, −133.66 vs −72.41 μm3;
between-group difference, −61.25 μm3; 95% CI, −121.78 to
−0.72 μm3; Table 2). There were no significant differences
between the 2 groups in progression of cartilage denudation,
bone marrow lesion, effusion volume (Table 2), or in trabecu-
lar morphology. There were no significant differences
between the 2 groups in change in subchondral tibia or in hip
and in bone mineral density. Results of a completers’analysis
are presented in the eTable in Supplement 2. Semiquantita-
tive cartilage abnormalities were not significantly different,
except for superficial fibrillation, which was more common
in the saline group (34% vs 13%; between-group difference,
21%; 95% CI, 7%-35%).
The decrease in knee pain did not significantly differ
across treatment groups: −1.2 units in the triamcinolone
vs −1.9 in the saline group; between-group mean difference,
−0.64; 95% CI, −1.6 to 0.29). Also, there were no signifi-
cant differences in any of the secondary patient-reported or
objective clinical end points (Figure 2 and Table 3). Both
groups exhibited a nonsignificant increase in high-sensitivity
C-reactive protein (0.2 vs 0.1 mg/L; between-group mean
difference, −0.1 mg/L; 95% CI, −0.4 to 0.2 mg/L). At the final
visit, 45% of participants guessed their treatment assign-
ment correctly.
There were more adverse events in the saline group
(63 vs 52 participants, P = .02; 182 vs 131 events, P = .02).
Eight were classified as treatment related, 3 in the saline
group (1 cellulitis, 2 injection site pain) and 5 in the triam-
cinolone group (1 facial flushing, 4 injection site pain).
There were no significant differences in serious adverse
events (P value = .06). One was classified as related (celluli-
tis, saline group). The incidence of new or worsening hyper-
tension was not greater in the triamcinolone group (1 vs 2
events), and there were no instances of osteonecrosis or sub-
chondral fracture. Hemoglobin A1c levels declined in the tri-
amcinolone but increased in the saline group (−0.1% vs 0.2%;
between-group difference, −0.2; 95% CI, −0.5 to −0.007, with
adjustment for KL grade, sex, and body mass index).

Discussion
In this clinical trial investigating the benefits and risks of
intra-articular corticosteroids, 40 mg of triamcinolone
administered every 3 months over 2 years into knees with
osteoarthritis and inflammation resulted in significantly
greater cartilage volume loss and no significant difference in
knee pain than did saline injections. These results contrast
with a previous smaller trial that tested a similar regimen and
found no difference in the rate of radiographic joint space
loss and detected a benefit on knee pain in some secondary
(but not primary) end points.13 The use of MRI in this study
enabled direct quantitation of cartilage and soft-tissue struc-
tures and showed more cartilage loss in the triamcinolone
group than in the saline group. Radiography does not image
cartilage directly and is insensitive to change,14 so it may not
have detected the small changes in cartilage loss measured
on the MRIs in this study.
The 2-year change in the index compartment cartilage
thickness was greater in the triamcinolone group with a
between-group difference of −0.11 (95% CI, −0.20 to −0.03),
which corresponds to a moderate effect size of 0.46 mm.
A value for the amount of change in cartilage loss that would
represent a minimally clinically important difference is
not established; however, this change was smaller in magni-
tude than the cross-sectional differences between one KL
grade measured in a prior natural history study (eg, 0.35 mm
between grades 2 and 327). Increased progression was
not detected in other osteoarthritis features, structurally
or clinically. In fact, superficial fibrillation worsened
more frequently in the saline group, although this may
have been due to chance since secondary and semiquantita-
tive structural measures showed no difference between
groups. The effects that were detected on cartilage loss were
statistically significant and consistent across different mea-
surements. In vivo and clinical evidence show catabolic
effects of corticosteroids.12 Although the cartilage loss was
not associated with worsening of symptom outcomes, rates
of cartilage loss have been associated with higher rates of
arthroplasty,32 raising the possibility of potential for longer-
term adverse consequences on the health of the joint. Carti-
lage structure should be evaluated in any future clinical stud-
ies of similar therapeutics.
The hypothesis that intra-articular corticosteroids might
reduce the rate of cartilage loss and other structural mani-
festations of osteoarthritis was based on recognition of the
role of inflammation in its pathogenesis,4 and reduced
structural progression observed in vivo.33,34 Suppression of
inflammation could attenuate catabolic effects of inflamma-
tion and reduce articular damage.35 However, these results
showed greater progression of knee cartilage volume loss
and no sustained effect on intra-articular inflammation as
indicated by persistence of effusion. As a proof-of-concept
study, the results raise questions about the role of inflam-
mation in osteoarthritis progression.
It has been suggested that intra-articular saline in-
jection might have a therapeutic effect in osteoarthritis,36

a hypothesis based on clinical trial results in which saline
was used as a comparator with apparent symptomatic
improvement.36 However, there is a strong placebo response
to intra-articular injection, and no prior trials included a
sham injection. Also, the rate of cartilage loss in this study
was commensurate with that observed in prior natural his-
tory studies, so it is likely that the difference in cartilage loss
rates between groups was due to an adverse effect of intra-
articular corticosteroids on cartilage rather than a benefit
from intra-articular saline.
There was a significant difference in HbA1c levels be-
tween groups observed by the end of the study, but this fa-
vored the triamcinolone group and may be due to chance.
Limitations
This study has several limitations. First, symptom ascertain-
ment took place every 3 months with the goal of measur-
ing long-term effects on these outcomes. Pain was not mea-
sured within the 4-week period after each injection, during
which benefits are known to occur.37 Thus, any transient
benefit on pain ending within the 3-month period between
each injection could have been missed by these methods.
Second, participants were permitted to continue their usual
medications during the trial, which might have attenuated
any between-group differences in symptom outcomes even
though participants were asked to discontinue nonsteroidal
anti-inflammatory drugs prior to each assessment, and the

use of analgesics taken for breakthrough pain was also
adjusted for in the multivariate models. Third, high expecta-
tions and large placebo responses could also have affected
assessments of effects, although these appeared modest
compared with typical osteoarthritis trials.38 Fourth, this
study was targeted at osteoarthritic knees that had some
degree of inflammation, determined using ultrasonography.
It is possible that this imaging technique lacks specificity in
identifying inflammation, or that pain from knees with
osteoarthritis and features of inflammation are paradoxically
less likely to respond to triamcinolone, as was found in a pre-
vious study.39 Alternatively, although the dose regimen
tested was consistent with clinical practice guidelines, it is
possible that the dose or frequency was insufficient to gener-
ate sufficient anti-inflammatory effect to reduce pain in the
long term.
Conclusions
Among patients with symptomatic knee osteoarthritis, 2
years of intra-articular triamcinolone, compared with intra-
articular saline, resulted in significantly greater cartilage
volume loss and no significant difference in knee pain. These
findings do not support this treatment for patients with
symptomatic knee osteoarthritis.
