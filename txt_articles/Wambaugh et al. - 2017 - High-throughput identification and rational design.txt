Abstract
Antibiotic-resistant infections kill approximately 23,000 people and cost $20,000,000,000
each year in the United States alone despite the widespread use of small-molecule antimi-
crobial combination therapy. Antibiotic combinations typically have an additive effect: the
efficacy of the combination matches the sum of the efficacies of each antibiotic when used
alone. Small molecules can also act synergistically when the efficacy of the combination is
greater than the additive efficacy. However, synergistic combinations are rare and have
been historically difficult to identify. High-throughput identification of synergistic pairs is lim-
ited by the scale of potential combinations: a modest collection of 1,000 small molecules
involves 1 million pairwise combinations. Here, we describe a high-throughput method for
rapid identification of synergistic small-molecule pairs, the overlap2 method (O2M). O2M
extracts patterns from chemical-genetic datasets, which are created when a collection of
mutants is grown in the presence of hundreds of different small molecules, producing a pre-
cise set of phenotypes induced by each small molecule across the mutant set. The identifica-
tion of mutants that show the same phenotype when treated with known synergistic
molecules allows us to pinpoint additional molecule combinations that also act synergisti-
cally. As a proof of concept, we focus on combinations with the antibiotics trimethoprim and
sulfamethizole, which had been standard treatment against urinary tract infections until
widespread resistance decreased efficacy. Using O2M, we screened a library of 2,000 small
molecules and identified several that synergize with the antibiotic trimethoprim and/or sulfa-
methizole. The most potent of these synergistic interactions is with the antiviral drug azido-
thymidine (AZT). We then demonstrate that understanding the molecular mechanism
underlying small-molecule synergistic interactions allows the rational design of additional
combinations that bypass drug resistance. Trimethoprim and sulfamethizole are both folate
biosynthesis inhibitors. We find that this activity disrupts nucleotide homeostasis, which
blocks DNA replication in the presence of AZT. Building on these data, we show that other
small molecules that disrupt nucleotide homeostasis through other mechanisms (hydroxy-
urea and floxuridine) also act synergistically with AZT. These novel combinations inhibit the
growth and virulence of trimethoprim-resistant clinical Escherichia coli and Klebsiella

Author summary
Antibiotic resistance is a growing problem that threatens our ability to treat systemic bac-
terial infections. One strategy to combat antibiotic resistance is the use of synergistic anti-
biotic pairs that, when combined, have activity that is considerably greater than the sum of
each individual drug’s activity on its own. Synergistic combinations can even inhibit the
growth of bacteria that are resistant to the individual treatment drugs. However, synergis-
tic pairs are rare and difficult to identify. High-throughput identification of synergistic
pairs is challenging due to scale: 1 million different pairs are possible for a relatively small
collection of 1,000 small molecules. Here, we describe a high-throughput method for rapid
identification of synergistic small-molecule pairs, termed the overlap2 method (O2M),
that dramatically speeds up the screening process. First, we identify mutants that show the
same phenotype when treated with each individual molecule in a synergistic pair, then use
this information to guide screens for additional synergistic pairs. As a proof of concept, we
studied the synergistic antibiotic pair trimethoprim and sulfamethizole, and we identified
several additional synergistic molecules. Among these is the antiviral drug azidothymidine
(AZT), which blocks bacterial DNA replication. Trimethoprim and sulfamethizole both
inhibit folate biosynthesis, which is necessary for the proper synthesis of nucleotides for
DNA replication and repair. We found that reduced nucleotide levels sensitize E. coli cells
to AZT. When we substitute trimethoprim with other small molecules that also reduce
nucleotide levels, we find that these small molecules also act synergistically with AZT.
Indeed, AZT in combination with trimethoprim substitutes inhibits the growth of trimeth-
oprim -resistant clinical isolates more potently than trimethoprim and AZT or trimetho-
prim and sulfamethizole. This work demonstrates that when we resolve the pathways that
underlie synergistic interactions, we can then identify additional small molecules that act
by similar mechanisms, providing a means to bypass antibiotic resistance.
Introduction
Small-molecule antimicrobial therapy facilitated one of the greatest increases in lifespan in his-
tory but is endangered by the rise of antimicrobial-resistant “superbugs” [1]. The CDC esti-
mates that antibiotic-resistant bacteria cause more than 2 million infections and 23,000 deaths
annually in the United States alone [2]. Combating antibiotic resistance requires a regular sup-
ply of new antimicrobial drugs, as bacteria inevitably acquire resistance to any single drug.
Two main approaches are commonly used to identify additional antibiotics: new drug discov-
ery and repurposing of drugs already approved for other conditions [3–6]. New drugs are
more likely to result in breakthroughs but require a large upfront capital investment in time-
consuming clinical trials. Repurposing can move drugs into the clinic without extensive trials
but will not identify novel drug classes or structures [7].
This study explores a third strategy to combat antimicrobial resistance: synergistic combina-
tion therapy. Synergy occurs when 2 drugs act together with efficacy beyond the additive effect

 of each drug on its own [8]. Since synergistic drug pairs can kill microbes that are resistant to 1
drug in the pair [9] and are thought to slow the evolution of resistance [10,11], they have gener-
ated considerable interest as a promising way to overcome antimicrobial drug resistance.
Delays in the commencement of treatment of severe infections can dramatically increase
mortality rates—for example, septic patients face an 8% increase in mortality for each hour’s
delay [12]. Therefore, combinations of antimicrobials are commonly used prior to the identifi-
cation of the causal organism. Most of the combinations currently employed are additive, but
meta-analyses of clinical trials indicate better outcomes if synergistic combinations are used
when the causal organism is unknown [12–15]. Molecules in additive combinations also fre-
quently act against the same target or target pathways [16] and thus are potentially more sus-
ceptible to resistance-conferring mutation than combinations with different targets. However,
few synergistic combinations have been identified [17] (S1 Table), and high-throughput iden-
tification has been challenging due to the numbers involved: a collection of 1,000 molecules
has 1 million potential pairwise combinations.
We previously described a new approach to high-throughput identification of synergistic
small-molecule pairs: the overlap2 method (O2M) [18]. O2M uses at least 1 known synergistic
interaction to predict many additional interactions from large-scale chemical-genetics data.
The rationale was that each small molecule in a synergistic pair produces a set of phenotypes—
chemical-genetic signature—in a precise set of mutants that show reduced or enhanced growth
in the presence of each molecule. When mutants exhibit the same phenotype when treated
with known synergistic molecules, we predict that any molecule that induces the same pheno-
type from the same mutant will act synergistically with each original synergistic molecule. This
was indeed the case, even when the known synergistic molecules have different mechanisms of
action [18]. When we validated O2M on the pathogenic fungus Cryptococcus neoformans, we
identified 36 new synergistic interactions with a low false positive rate (73% of the predictions
were verified) [18]. Since then, several other groups published methods using chemical-genet-
ics datasets to identify synergistic small-molecule interactions [19–21]. Chemical-genetics
datasets are widely available for a variety of pathogenic microbes, including Plasmodium falcip-
arum [22,23], Mycobacterium tuberculosis [24], Candida albicans [25,26], Candida glabrata
[27], and C. neoformans [18]. Thus, methods identifying synergistic drug interactions from
chemical-genetics datasets are potentially broadly applicable.
In this study, we show that O2M is also applicable to bacterial pathogens and antibiotics.
Furthermore, we expand its utility with a novel high-throughput screening method for syner-
gistic combinations and elucidate the molecular mechanism of a new drug combination. From
this, we go on to rationally design synergistic combinations with different targets but the same
phenotypic consequences, thus bypassing the original resistance mechanism. Indeed, our
rationally designed synergistic combinations efficiently inhibit growth of clinical isolates resis-
tant to the original antibiotic combination. In sum, we have developed an adaptable method
for high-throughput screening for synergistic small-molecule pairs that facilitates rational
design of synergistic small-molecule combinations, thereby addressing a key medical need in
the treatment of drug-resistant infections.

molecules, O2M, can be successfully applied to organisms from different kingdoms. We ini-

 [28] with comparable success. In this section, we describe the initial analysis of the published
E. coli chemical-genetics dataset [28]. In the next section, we show how information from anal-
ysis of this dataset allows high-throughput screening for synergistic molecule pairs.
O2M requires a chemical-genetics dataset, generated when a library of knockout mutants is
grown in the presence of >100 different chemicals. A quantitative growth score is calculated
for each mutant/small-molecule combination. Growth scores can indicate either slower
growth (negative values) or faster growth (positive values) compared to wild-type growth
scores. The growth scores of all mutants when treated with each small molecule is that small
molecule’s “chemical-genetic signature.”
O2M is based on the rationale that similarities between chemical-genetic signatures of a
known synergistic pair contains information that is somehow indicative of synergy—and thus
can be used to identify additional synergistic interactions (Fig 1A and [18]). When we compare
the chemical-genetic signatures of a pair of small molecules already known to act synergisti-
cally, we identified a subset of mutants with similar growth scores. We term this subset of
mutants “putative synergy prediction mutants.” We hypothesized that any molecule that elic-
ited the same phenotypes in the same mutants as the known synergistic molecules would also
act synergistically with each member of the known synergistic pair.
We analyzed chemical-genetic signatures for the known synergistic antibiotic pair trimeth-
oprim and sulfamethizole from the Nichols et al. E. coli chemical-genetics dataset [28]. This
resource contains quantitative growth scores for over 4,000 E. coli knockout mutants grown
under approximately 300 different conditions (including different types of media and lysogeny
broth [LB] medium containing small molecules). We looked for genes whose knockout
mutants exhibit a significant (|Z| > 2.5) growth score to both trimethoprim and sulfamethizole
(Fig 1B). Genes that are transcribed as a single unit (according to EcoliWiki: http://ecoliwiki.
net/colipedia/index.php/Welcome_to_EcoliWiki) were binned together. We identified 4 ele-
ments common to both chemical-genetic signatures: ECK0963-68,ECK1082-86,ECK1710-13,
ECK1864-66,and ECK3930. Knockouts of these gene(s) are putative synergy prediction
mutants.
We then calculated if each putative synergy prediction mutant successfully identified tri-
methoprim synergizers. Again, using the Nichols et al. dataset [28], we identified all small mol-
ecules that elicit a significant score (|Z| > 2.5) from the 4 putative synergy prediction mutants.
We also generated a list of negative control molecules that did not elicit a phenotype from any
mutant in any response pattern gene. We performed checkerboard assays, a standard measure
of synergistic interactions [29], for each predicted synergizer or negative control combined
with trimethoprim or sulfamethizole. All small molecules and their minimum inhibitory con-
centrations (MICs) are listed in Table 1.
A synergistic interaction is defined as at least a 4-fold decrease in the MIC of each drug in
the pair, producing a fractional inhibitory concentration index (FICI) of �0.5 [30]. We found
that small molecules that inhibit growth of putative synergy prediction mutant eck1864-66Δ
operon are enriched for synergistic interactions with both trimethoprim (p < 0.03, Fisher’s
exact test) and sulfamethizole (p < 0.05, Fisher’s exact test) relative to a randomly generated
negative control small-molecule set (Fig 1C & 1D). For example, 25% of predicted synergizers
acted synergistically with trimethoprim, compared to 4% of the negative control set. None of
the other synergistic response pattern operons identified synergistic interactions with trimeth-
oprim or sulfamethizole at a higher rate than chance (S1 Fig). In total, we identified 5 new syn-
ergistic interactions from analyzing the small molecules used in generation of the E. coli
chemical-genetics dataset [28]. Azidothymidine (AZT) acted synergistically with both trimeth-
oprim and sulfamethizole. Three molecules synergize only with trimethoprim and 1 only with

which we first presented in Brown et al. [18]. O2M requires a chemical-genetic dataset. To generate these datasets, a

growth, we calculated a quantitative growth score for each combination of mutant + small molecule. From these data, we
generate a chemical-genetic signature for each small molecule. This signature includes the score for each mutant in the

 sulfamethizole. Since trimethoprim interacted with more molecules, we prioritize it in subse-
quent experiments.
The genes in the ECK1864-66operon are involved in DNA synthesis, modification, and
repair, which might explain why this operon, and not our other putative synergy prediction
mutants, predicted synergy with trimethoprim. ECK1864 encodes an endonuclease that
resolves Holliday junctions [31,32]. ECK1865 gene product does not have a known molecular
function, but the mutant is sensitive to ionizing radiation [33]. ECK1866 encodes dihydro-
neopterin triphosphate pyrophosphohydrolase, an enzyme involved in the early stages of folate
biosynthesis [34]. In contrast, the other putative synergy prediction genes, whose mutants did
not enrich for trimethoprim synergizers, encoded gene products that did not function in path-
ways related to DNA synthesis, repair, or folate biosynthesis [35,36].
Notably, these experiments identified new synergistic partners for trimethoprim and sulfa-
methizole that are not currently used as antibiotics but are approved for human use in other
indications. The antiviral drug AZT is promising because of its potent interaction with
both trimethoprim and sulfamethizole. AZT has previously reported antibacterial activity
but has not been shown to have any synergistic interactions with antibiotics [37–39]. AZT
and several other newly identified synergizers are DNA-damaging agents, thereby suggesting a
significantly different mechanism of action than the trimethoprim + sulfamethizole
combination.
In addition, we performed a similar analysis on vancomycin, which acts synergistically with
cephalosporins [40,41]. When we tested the cephalosporins used in the Nichols et al. dataset
with vancomycin for synergistic interactions, cefaclor acted synergistically with vancomycin in
a checkerboard assay (S2 Fig). We found only 1 gene/operon, ECK3247-48,with a mutant that
exhibited a significant growth score (|Z| > 2.5) when grown in the presence of vancomycin
and cefaclor. We then identified all small molecules from the Nichols et al. dataset [28] that
induced a significant phenotype (|Z| > 2.5) from eck3247Δ or eck3248Δ cells, predicting that
these molecules would synergize with vancomycin. When we tested these in checkerboard
assays for synergy (S2 Fig), we identified 3 molecules that synergized with vancomycin: chela-
tors EDTA and EGTA and aminocoumarin antibiotic novobiocin. Ion availability is known
to effect pathogenicity [42] and vancomycin efficacy [43], but we cannot find previous reports
of an interaction between vancomycin and novobiocin, which inhibits DNA gyrase activity
[44]. These data demonstrate that O2M identifies synergistic interactions for multiple
antibiotics.

each vertical line represents a different mutant. A blue line represents small colony size compared to wild-type cells, or a
sensitive mutant; a yellow line represents larger colony size, or a resistant mutant. We compare the genetic signatures for
starting drugs (e.g., trimethoprim) and known synergistic molecules (e.g., sulfamethizole) computationally. From this analysis,
we identify genes whose knockout mutants show the significant growth scores to the starting drug and all its known synergistic
partners (outlined by red boxes). These represent the putative synergy prediction mutants. Since our starting drug and its
known synergizers induce significant phenotypes from these mutants, we hypothesize that other small molecules that induce
significant phenotypes will also synergize with the starting drug. We reanalyze the chemical-genetic dataset to identify these
small molecules, then test them in checkerboard analyses. (B) The folate biosynthesis pathway, with trimethoprim and

 Synergy prediction mutants for trimethoprim allow easy, high-throughput
screening for synergistic drug interactions
We exploited our newly identified synergy prediction mutant (eck1864-66Δ) to perform one of
the first high-throughput screens for synergistic pairs (Fig 2A). Our rationale was that because
synergy prediction mutants exhibited the same phenotypic response to molecules known to act
synergistically, this limited set of knockout mutants could be used to rapidly screen additional
small molecules to identify those that are likely to be synergistic with the starting molecule.
Our assay is extremely simple and identifies synergistic pairs without performing multidrug
assays. Instead, synergy prediction mutants functionally substitute for 1 of the antibiotics. We
screened the Microsource Spectrum Collection, a small-molecule library of 2,000 compounds
that is enriched for Food and Drug Administration (FDA)-approved drugs. We grew wild-
type and eck1864-66Δ mutant cells in the presence of each small molecule, then identified
small molecules that inhibit growth of the synergy response marker strain but not wild-type
cells after 18 hours of growth (Z score < −2.5). We identified 28 of these putative trimetho-
prim-synergizing molecules (Table 2).
We verified the synergistic interactions between trimethoprim and our screen hits using 2
different methods: checkerboard assays and Bliss Independence. Checkerboards are preferable
but require that both small molecules inhibit microbial growth on their own. Of the 18 screen
hits that met this criterion, 8 were verified to act synergistically with trimethoprim (Fig 2B).
This 44% enrichment rate is significantly (p < 0.05) greater than the 4% frequency of trimetho-
prim synergizers in a randomly selected set of small molecules (Fig 1). Six of these small mole-
cules (phthalylsulfacetamide, phthalysulfathiazole, sulfabenzamide, sulfacetamide,
sulfaphenazole, and sulfapyridine) are sulfonamide antibiotics that inhibit dihydropteroate
synthetase, the same target as sulfamethizole. A seventh, dapsone, also inhibits dihydropteroate
synthetase but belongs to a different class of drugs [45]. The final verified screen hit, mitoxan-
throne, is an antineoplastic DNA-intercalating agent [46] and not a sulfonamide antibiotic.
The remaining 10 screen hits do not inhibit E. coli growth on their own, so we attempted to
verify their synergistic action using the Bliss independence model [30]. Briefly, in a 96-well
plate containing growth medium and bacteria, we created a gradient of trimethoprim, then
added each small molecule of interest at both 10 μM and 100 μM concentrations. Synergistic
small molecules enhance growth inhibition by trimethoprim at both concentrations versus tri-
methoprim alone. We found that 2 of 10 small molecules exhibit synergy at both concentra-
tions (Fig 2C). Sulfanitran is a sulfonamide antibiotic. Cyclosporine is a cyclic peptide that
inhibits calcineurin [47] but is not known to have a bacterial target.
The new synergistic molecules found from O2M analysis and the high-throughput screen
fall into 2 main groups. First, the sulfonamide antibiotics almost certainly act by the same
mechanism as trimethoprim + sulfamethizole, so strains resistant to the combination would
likely also be resistant to these new pairs. The second group consists of several DNA damaging
agents (AZT, mitomycin C, mitaxanthrone). This result suggests a second molecular mecha-
nism underlying synergy. Therefore, we focus on this second group in subsequent experiments.
Synergistic drug pairs are active against multidrug-resistant clinical E.
coli and K. pneumoniae isolates
Our most promising new synergistic interaction is between trimethoprim or sulfamethizole
and AZT. The first anti-HIV drug [48], AZT, was investigated as a chemotherapeutic before
the discovery of its antiretroviral activity [49]. AZT’s MIC against multidrug-resistant (MDR)
E. coli and K. pneumoniae is in the nanogram per milliliter range (Table 3), suggesting that it
could be a powerful antibiotic. AZT causes premature chain termination during bacterial

 DNA replication [38,39,50], induces the SOS response [38,39], and moderately increases
mutation rates [51].
We tested whether AZT acts synergistically with trimethoprim in 12 MDR clinical isolates
of E. coli and 5 MDR K. pneumoniae isolates. Seven of the E. coli isolates and 4 K. pneumoniae
isolates are resistant to the trimethoprim/sulfamethizole combination. In the vast majority of
trimethoprim/sulfamethizole-resistant isolates, the classic combination of trimethoprim and
sulfamethizole no longer acted synergistically (FICI � 0.5) (Fig 3A). One possible reason
behind this is that trimethoprim and sulfamethiole targets are in the same pathway [52], so
resistance to 1 drug could confer some resistance to the other and block the synergistic interac-
tion. In contrast, trimethoprim and AZT acted synergistically against 5 E. coli and 2 K.

 pneumoniae trimethoprim/sulfamethizole-resistant isolates. Our new synergistic pair thus acts
against multiple species of trimethoprim/sulfamethizole-resistant bacteria.
The synergistic interaction between trimethoprim and AZT activates a
stress pathway that the single agent drugs do not
The mechanisms underlying synergistic interactions are poorly explored, with the exception of
trimethoprim + sulfamethizole (or other sulfamonamides). Both molecules are inhibitors of
folate biosynthesis, so these drugs were historically thought to synergize due to simultaneous
inhibition of 2 enzymes in the folate biosynthesis pathway [52]. The Nichols et al. chemical-
genetic analysis suggests that trimethoprim and sulfonamides differentially impact the steps
between tetrahydrofolate and 5,10-methylene tetrahydrofolate production (Fig 1B) [28].
Regardless, since DNA-damaging agents such as AZT do not inhibit folate biosynthesis, they
likely act through a second mechanism of synergy.
AZT alone induces the SOS response [38,39], so we hypothesized that the synergistic pair-
ing with trimethoprim could amplify each molecule’s individual activity. We performed check-
erboard assays on K12 E. coli carrying a green fluorescent protein (GFP) reporter plasmid
under control of the SOS-induced sulA promoter. We selected the sulA promoter because it is
induced late in the SOS response, indicating a robust SOS response and cell growth arrest [53].
Neither trimethoprim nor sulfamethizole alone induces the sulA reporter compared to a
no-drug control (Fig 4A). AZT alone induced the sulA promoter modestly but reproducibly
(1.6-fold relative to the control). These results predict that the combination of AZT and tri-
methoprim would show a 3-fold induction. Instead, we see a 9-fold induction (p < 0.01;
Mann-Whitney test). We observed the same trend for mitomycin C, a DNA crosslinking agent
[54] that also synergizes with trimethoprim (Fig 1).
We also tested 2 additional molecules as controls. The RNA polymerase inhibitor rifampi-
cin, which blocks the SOS response [55] and does not synergize with trimethoprim (Fig 2),
exhibited a lower SOS response in combination with trimethoprim than alone (p < 0.005;
Mann-Whitney test). Similarly, the DNA-damaging agent hydroxyurea (HU) [56], which does
not synergize with trimethoprim (Fig 2), also does not induce the sulA promoter alone or in
combination with trimethoprim.
Since the SOS response induces error-prone DNA repair, we hypothesized that the combi-
nation of trimethoprim and AZT increases mutation burden beyond that caused by each small
molecule alone. To test this hypothesis, we performed a fluctuation assay to measure the muta-
tion rate [57]. We grew cells in subinhibitory concentrations of each small molecule alone or
in combination, then plated cells to LB + 15 μg/ml nalidixic acid, which selects for mutations
in the topoisomerase gene [58,59]. We calculated mutation rate from the number of resistant
colonies within the total population [60].
The trimethoprim synergizers AZT and mitomycin C both increase mutation rate by at least
3-fold in combination with trimethoprim but not alone, even at the subinhibitory concentra-
tions tested (1/8 of MIC) (Fig 4B). Sulfamethizole alone or in combination with trimethoprim
does not increase mutation rates. These data suggest that the amplification of DNA damage is
an important step in the synergistic interaction between trimethoprim and AZT (or mitomycin
C), while trimethoprim and sulfamethizole interact through a different mechanism.
Genetic or chemical reduction of deoxynucleotide pools sensitizes E. coli
cells to AZT
Our data support the model that DNA damage accumulates in cells treated with trimethoprim
+ AZT. AZT’s connection to DNA damage is clear from its known mechanism of action [39].

 Fig 4. The SOS response is induced by trimethoprim and azidothymidine (AZT). (A) SOS response
measured by a green fluorescent protein (GFP) reporter gene under control of the sulA reporter. Small
molecules were added at 50% minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC). Expected sulA induction (green) is
either the induction by the second molecule or, if the sulA reporter is repressed by the second molecule, no
induction or repression. Trimethoprim does not induce the sulA reporter, so it is considered to not have any
contribution to the expected value, and we do not simply sum the induction of trimethoprim + molecule #2. The
observed sulA induction (purple) is significantly higher than expected in the trimethoprim and AZT
combination but not nonsynergistic combinations, such as trimethoprim + hydroxyurea or trimethoprim
+ rifampicin. Since the trimethoprim + sulfamethizole combination does not induce sulA, the molecular
mechanisms underlying trimethoprim + sulfamethizole synergy likely differ from trimethoprim + AZT synergy.
Significance was calculated using a Mann-Whitney test. Error bars represent the standard deviation. In all
cases when we observed a significant difference between expected and observed, we also found a significant
difference between induction by molecule #2 and induction in the combination. The data for these graphs are
in S7 Table. (B) Fluctuation assay measures the mutation rate following small-molecule treatment. Small
molecules alone (solid colors) do not significantly increase mutation rate. Trimethoprim combined (striped
bars) with synergistic partners AZT or mitomycin C increases mutation rate. P values were calculated using
Fisher’s exact test. Error bars represent the 95% confidence interval. The data for these graphs are in
S8 Table.

 However, trimethoprim’s connection is indirect. Folate is necessary for the biosynthesis of
purines, thymidine [61], and methionine [62], and treatment with trimethoprim disrupts
nucleotide homeostasis [61]. We hypothesized that such reduced nucleotide availability
amplifies the phenotypic consequences of premature chain termination caused by AZT.
Should the synergistic interaction between trimethoprim and AZT be due to the simultaneous
inhibition of chain termination and depleted nucleotide pools, then we would expect addi-
tional, unrelated small molecules that cause similar effects to also interact synergistically. Fur-
thermore, genetic mutations that deplete nucleotide pools would result in increased sensitivity
to AZT, and other chain-terminating agents would cause increased sensitivity to
trimethoprim.
First, we tested the proposed nucleotide homeostasis/DNA chain termination interaction
chemically. We performed a checkerboard assay with AZT and HU or floxuridine, 2 FDA-
approved drugs that alter deoxynucleotide triphosphate (dNTP) balance [63]. Both HU and
floxuridine acted synergistically with AZT but not trimethoprim (Fig 5A). We then tested tri-
methoprim in combination with nucleoside analogs other than AZT. As expected, nucleoside
analogs that inhibit E. coli growth interact synergistically with trimethoprim but not AZT
(Fig 5B).
Second, this interaction between nucleotide pools and AZT also occurs genetically. The E.
coli gene deoxycytidine deaminase (dcd) encodes deoxycytidine triphosphate (dCTP) deami-
nase [64]. dcd deletion mutants exhibit depleted deoxythymidine triphosphate (dTTP) pools
and elevated dCTP pools when grown in minimal medium [64–66]. dcd deletion mutant
cells exhibit a 32-fold increase in AZT sensitivity compared to wild-type cells but no change in
trimethoprim or rifampicin sensitivity (Fig 5C). By contrast, mutants in nucleoside diphos-
phate kinase (ndk) [67] exhibit elevated dCTP and dTTP pools but lower deoxyadenosine tri-
phosphate (dATP) pools [66,68]. ndk deletion mutant cells exhibit a 4-fold decrease in AZT
sensitivity (increased resistance) compared to wild-type cells. These results suggest that ade-
quate dTTP is necessary for surviving AZT exposure. Therefore, we conclude that simulta-
neous disruption of nucleotide homeostasis and DNA replication increase E. coli growth
inhibition.
We next tested if DNA repair mutants in general are hypersensitive to AZT or if the hyper-
sensitivity is specific to disrupted nucleotide homeostasis. We grew cells deficient in mismatch
repair (mutL, mutS, or mutH deletion mutants) or nucleotide excision repair (uvrA, uvrB, or
uvrC deletion mutants) in AZT, trimethoprim, and rifampicin and did not observe increased
sensitivity to any of these (Fig 5C). Finally, to make sure that the interaction between AZT and
trimethoprim was not due to methionine depletion, we tested a deletion mutant in the methio-
nine synthase gene metH [62]. metH mutant cells exhibited wild-type levels sensitivities to
AZT, trimethoprim, and rifampicin (Fig 5C). Therefore, we conclude that disruption of nucle-
otide homeostasis (by multiple possible mechanisms) hypersensitizes bacterial cells to DNA
damage caused by AZT. By substituting HU or floxuridine for trimethoprim, we demonstrated
that we can rationally design additional synergistic pairs once the molecular mechanism
underlying an interaction is understood.
Small molecules that disrupt nucleotide homeostasis act synergistically
with AZT against clinical E. coli and K. pneumoniae isolates
Finally, we tested our new, rationally designed synergistic pairs against our collection of clini-
cal E. coli and K. pneumoniae strains. Substituting either HU (Fig 6A) or floxuridine (Fig 6B)
for trimethoprim, we found that either molecule combined with AZT inhibited growth of tri-
methoprim/sulfamethizole-resistant isolates. HU + AZT acted synergistically in 15 of 17

 clinical isolates, including all but 1 of the trimethoprim/sulfamethizole-resistant isolates
(n = 11). Floxuridine + AZT also acted synergistically in most clinical isolates (12 of 17),
including all but 2 trimethoprim/sulfamethizole-resistant isolates. The MICs of floxuridine
and AZT are sub-μg/ml for most MDR clinical isolates, whereas MICs for trimethoprim or sul-
famethizole were up to 5,000 μg/ml in vitro (Table 3). Rationally designed synergistic pairs
therefore bypassed resistance in clinical isolates.
The new floxuridine-AZT combination shows markedly improved efficacy
in a zebrafish infection model
We then tested the floxuridine + AZT combination in a zebrafish infection model. Efficacy of
synergistic drug pairs has historically been difficult to evaluate in vertebrate systems, and
many prior studies use the moth larvae Galleria mellonella or perform only in vitro tests
[19,20,69,70]. Zebrafish offer several advantages: they have a mammalian-like innate immune
system [71], a long history as microbial infection models [71–75], and are a good platform for
assessing drug toxicity [76,77]. We injected approximately 2,500 colony-forming units (CFU)
of trimethoprim-resistant E. coli into the pericardial cavity of zebrafish embryos [75,78], incu-
bated for 3 hours, then treated with either the original drug combination (trimethoprim + sul-
famethizole) or our rationally designed combination (floxuridine + AZT). We analyzed
bacterial burden at 24 hours postinoculation (hpi) at dosages analogous to human dosage (see
Materials and methods and Table 4) [79,80]. The new combination was indeed successful—it
resulted in a 10,000-fold reduction in median bacterial burden in infected zebrafish embryos
treated with floxuridine + AZT compared to infected embryos treated with trimethoprim + sul-
famethizole (Fig 7A). When we infected embryos with a trimethoprim/sulfamethizole-

 sensitive E. coli strain, floxuridine + AZT treatment and trimethoprim + sulfamethizole treat-
ment were equally effective. (Fig 7B).
We also analyzed MICs in the presence of human serum, as a substantial increase in MIC
in the presence of serum would indicate that our small molecules of interest are binding to
serum proteins and are not bioavailable [81]. We tested MICs of floxuridine, AZT, trimetho-
prim, and sulfamethizole with and without 20% human serum and found only minor changes
in MIC (S14 Table). The dosages we use in zebrafish are well under the human dosage
(Table 4), suggesting that it would be possible to obtain the necessary drug concentrations in
humans.
Discussion
High-throughput identification of synergistic small-molecule pairs
Synergistic small molecules are of considerable clinical interest, but systematic identification
has been challenging. This study describes 4 significant advances to such systematic identifica-
tion. First, we demonstrate that O2M is generally applicable beyond the fungal pathogen for
which it was originally developed [18]. Second, we and others show that previously published
chemical-genetic datasets [18,22–26,28,82] can be successfully used as the raw input for O2M,
significantly decreasing the upfront investment required. Third, O2M identifies knockout
mutants that can be used as readouts for synergy in highly scalable screening assays for addi-
tional synergistic combinations. Finally, understanding the mechanisms that underlie syner-
gistic interactions can facilitate the rational design of further synergistic combinations that
bypass antibiotic resistance.
Our results show that a wide variety of synergistic combinations are available if we know
how to search for them. We would suggest that these discoveries represent a small fraction of
the potential synergistic combinations. In support of this idea, several groups recently pub-
lished analysis methods that, like our original O2M analysis [18], use chemical-genetics data to
predict synergy between antibiotics [19] or antifungals [20,21,70]. Notably, each method iden-
tifies different, complementary synergistic pairs, suggesting that current methods are far from
identifying all synergistic interactions.
As described here, the particular advantage of O2M is its scalability to screen for synergistic
small molecules that are not commonly used as antibiotics. This scalability is critical to keeping

zebrafish water, although trimethoprim and sulfamethizole were slightly toxic to embryos at these concentrations, so we lowered the doses to those shown.
Floxuridine is administered by IV, but since the oral dose of the other drugs are 100 to 200 times the IV dose, we used a dose within that range (120 times
the IV dose).

resistant E. coli strain (blood isolate #8, or BEC8) into zebrafish embryos, then treated them with drugs
starting at 3 hours postinoculation (hpi). At 24 hpi, we euthanized embryos and determined bacterial burden
(colony-forming units [CFU]) in whole fish. Each symbol (blue circles for floxuridine + AZT, orange squares for
trimethoprim [TMP] + sulfamethizole [SFZ], and grey triangles for vehicle control) represents a single fish.

 the initial screens as broad as possible—since substituting 1 member of a synergistic pair for a
second member can change the molecular mechanism underlying the interaction, identifica-
tion of diverse synergistic pairs offers the greatest potential for further rational design. We
screened a well-studied collection of FDA-approved small molecules, identifying 14 novel syn-
ergistic combinations with the widely used antibiotic trimethoprim. O2M is also much faster
than a pairwise screen of a small-molecule library. By identifying synergy prediction mutants,
we can screen 2,000 molecules and verify only those predicted to be synergistic. The 28 pre-
dicted synergistic molecules identified in our trimethoprim/sulfamethizole screen took less
than a week to validate. Testing of the entire 2,000 small-molecule collection in combination
with a single molecule would take months.
Mechanisms underlying synergistic small-molecule interactions
The molecular mechanisms underlying synergistic drug interactions are generally poorly
understood [4,28]. There are 3 main hypotheses for why any given pair of small molecules
exhibit synergistic interaction: that the pairs (1) act together to cause a third, novel inhibitory
activity (“gain-of-function” hypothesis), (2) act in combination by simultaneously inhibiting 2
different functions to increase potency (“two-hit” or “parallel pathway” hypothesis) [83], or (3)
1 drug increases the activity and/or bioavailability of the other (“bioavailability” hypothesis)
[84]. Our data demonstrate that the trimethoprim and AZT interaction likely represent a
“two-hit” mechanism, acting through the combined induction of DNA damage and blocking
DNA repair by disrupting nucleotide homeostasis (Fig 8). This molecular mechanism quite
likely differs from that historically thought to underlie the trimethoprim/sulfonamides [52].
Recent data suggest that the trimethoprim + sulfamethizole interaction is not as simple as
simultaneous inhibition of 2 folate biosynthesis enzymes [52]. Instead, the hypothesis is that
trimethoprim and sulfonamides result in buildup of different secondary metabolites, which
differentially impact enzyme activities [28]. However, since the phenotypic consequences of
treatment with trimethoprim + sulfamethizole differ from treatment with trimethoprim
+ AZT, the mechanisms are likely also different. We surmise that both combinations represent
“two-hit” synergistic interactions. “Two-hit” synergistic interactions can be predicted from
network analysis: genes/pathways whose knockouts exhibit synthetic lethality could be good
targets of drug combinations. These analyses also demonstrate the importance of network
analysis and high-throughput studies on model organisms [85]: the chemical-genomic dataset
we used for our initial O2M analysis was from a nonpathogenic K12 genetic background [28],
showing that K12 data are sufficient to elucidate synergistic drug mechanisms.
One potential concern about using trimethoprim + AZT or floxuridine + AZT clinically is
that these combinations increase mutation rate. While this is indeed a concern, many antibiot-
ics target DNA replication and other processes that also increase mutation rates. Our mea-
sured mutation rate for trimethoprim + AZT, approximately 2 x 10−8 mutations per cell, is
well within the range of other antibiotics [86]. These vary from 10−9 mutations per cell (clari-
thromycin and amoxicillin) [86] to 10−6 mutations per cell [87]. Mutation rates will vary with
species and strain [87,88], but trimethoprim + AZT induces mutation rates comparable to
those induced by ciprofloxacin [86].
Towards rational design of synergistic combination therapy
Once we identify biological pathways and processes whose simultaneous inhibition blocks
microbial growth, we can then rationally design synergistic drug treatments that bypass antibi-
otic resistance. Here, we present a proof-of-principle methodology that demonstrates the
power of this rational design. Once we identified the molecular mechanism underlying the

 trimethoprim + AZT interaction, we substituted trimethoprim for another FDA-approved
small molecule. This newly designed combination, floxuridine + AZT, achieved the same syn-
ergistic interaction with AZT yet bypassed trimethoprim resistance in MDR clinical isolates
(Figs 6 and 7). Indeed, floxuridine + AZT was far superior to trimethoprim + sulfamethizole
in a vertebrate infection model with trimethoprim/sulfamethizole-resistant E. coli. That is, we
inhibited MDR E. coli infection with lower doses of structurally unrelated but functionally sim-
ilar small molecules.
The optimal clinical application of interacting small molecules is currently under debate.
Recent work suggested that sequential, rather than simultaneous, application of synergistic
small molecules prevents the development of drug resistance [8,89]. Others suggest that antag-
onistic small-molecule interactions could be beneficial [8,83,90]. Antagonistic interactions
occur when 2 molecules in combination decrease each other’s efficacy. One theory is that
antagonism decreases the selective advantage of a drug-resistant mutation, and thus evolution
of resistance is slower to an antagonistic pair than a synergistic pair [90]. These ideas merit fur-
ther exploration in clinical and animal models of infection.
In sum, O2M is an important tool for high-throughput identification of synergistic small-
molecule pairs and successfully identifies new treatments to combat MDR infections. With the
growing antibiotic crisis, treatments that are effective against MDR bacteria need to move
Fig 8. Inhibition of nucleotide homeostasis amplifies the consequences of DNA damage, increasing
the toxicity of DNA-damaging agents. Trimethoprim treatment (orange graphics) blocks DNA repair, which
is induced by azidothymidine (AZT) treatment (blue graphics). The combined effects result in increased
growth inhibition relative to single-agent treatment.

 rapidly into the clinic. Our method of screening FDA-approved drugs identified candidate
treatments that could be deployed with fewer regulatory trials than needed for new drugs.
Moreover, our rationally designed treatment, floxuridine + AZT, also uses FDA-approved
agents (and AZT is well tolerated for short-term treatments, despite toxicities associated with
long-term use at high doses [91]). We hope to spur interest among clinicians to test such
designed synergistic combinations against difficult-to-treat MDR infections, when
appropriate.
Materials and methods
Ethics statement
Animals used in this study were handled in accordance with protocols approved by the Uni-
versity of Utah IACUC committee (protocol 10–02014), which follow guidelines from the
Guide for the Care and Use of Laboratory Animals and zfin.org. Zebrafish older than 3 days
postfertilization were euthanized by immersion in a chilled water bath followed by mechanical
disruption. Zebrafish younger than 3 days, which do not have developed pain sensors, were
euthanized by mechanical disruption. Infections took place under tricaine anesthesia.
E. coli strains
Unless otherwise stated, experiments were performed on E. coli K12 strain MG1655. E. coli
blood isolates #1–8 (referred to as BEC1, BEC2, etc.) are described in Barber et al. [78]. Uri-
nary tract infection (UTI) isolates and K. pneumoniae isolates were obtained from ARUP labs.
Strains are listed in S15 Table.
E. coli growth and small-molecule assays
All assays were performed in M9 minimal medium (10.5g/L M9 broth [Amresco], 0.2% casa-
mino acids, 0.1M CaCl2, 0.4% glucose, 1M MgSO4, 0.25% nicotinic acid, 0.33% thiamine in
H2O) unless otherwise stated. To determine MICs, an M9 culture of MG1655 was growth
overnight at 37˚C with shaking, then diluted to OD600 = 0.002. We then inoculated each well
with approximately 1,000 cells (2 μl of culture into 200 μl of medium per well). Plates were
incubated at 37˚C unless otherwise stated. Small-molecule gradients were diluted in 2-fold
dilution series unless otherwise stated. MIC values (Table 1) are calculated following 24 hours
incubation at 37˚C. MIC values are calculated as >90% growth inhibition unless otherwise
stated. MIC values for MDR strains, which grow more rapidly than lab strains, were calculated
following 24 hours incubation at 37˚C. When calculating MICs in the presence of human
serum, we used standard techniques but substituted up to 20% of the media volume with
human serum (Sigma).
O2M analysis
We performed O2M analysis as previously described [18] with the following variations. (Step-
by-step instructions are available in the S1 Text section). The Nichols et al. paper calculates a
growth score for each mutant + small molecule combination [28]. We then use these growth
scores to calculate significance in O2M analysis. We considered any growth score significant if
either: (1) growth score for mutant A and small molecule B � average growth score for all
mutants when grown on plates containing small molecule B + 2.5�standard deviation of all
small molecule B growth scores, or (2) growth score for mutant A and small molecule
B � average growth score for all mutants when grown on plates containing small molecule
B − 2.5�standard deviation of all small molecule B growth scores.

 This corresponds to a Z-score cutoff value of +/−2.5. We identified any gene whose knock-
out exhibited a significant score when exposed to trimethoprim or sulfamethizole in the Nichols
et al. dataset [28]. We then identified genes whose knockouts responded significantly across the
majority of concentrations of both drugs. If these genes are transcribed as part of a polycistronic
RNA, then a phenotype was considered significant if any mutant in that operon met the Z score
requirement (|Z| > 2.5). For example, if eck1864Δ was significant at 1 trimethoprim concentra-
tion and eck1865Δ at another, the entire ECK1864-66operon was considered a significant hit at
both those concentrations. For trimethoprim + sulfamethizole, this method identified 5 poten-
tial synergy prediction mutants/operons. We tested all small molecules predicted as synergistic
for each of these synergy prediction mutants/operons, then calculated enrichment for successful
predictions using a Fisher’s exact test. We also tested additional Z scores, |Z| > 1.96 and |Z| >
3.0, with no change in end result. |Z| > 3.0 identified ECK1864-66,ECK0964, and ECK1710-13
as putative synergy prediction mutants. As shown in Figs 1 and S1, only ECK1864-66enriched
for small molecules that synergize with trimethoprim. At |Z| > 1.96, ECK4132-33,ECK1189,
and ECK2901-04were also identified as putative synergy prediction mutants. None of these
mutants enriched for synergistic interactions with trimethoprim (S5 Fig).
FICI calculations
We followed the same method as Hsieh et al. [92] with minor modifications. For MG1655,
starting inoculation was 2 μl of an OD600 = 0.02 or 0.002 (10,000 or 1,000 cells per well of
200 μl medium, respectively). Any synergistic interaction was verified at both inoculation lev-
els but the initial MG1655 screen using 10,000 cells per well. FICI assays for the MG1655 strain
were incubated for 24 hours at 37˚C. FICI assays of clinical strains were incubated for 12
hours at 37˚C using an inoculum of 1,000 cells. OD600 was read on a BioTek plate reader
model Synergy H1. Growth inhibition �90% compared to the no-drug control was considered
significant.
E. coli mutant construction
E. coli mutant eck1864-66::kanR was made in MG1655 by deleting the candidate gene or
operon using the 1-step gene deletion method [93]. The putative knockout clones were con-
firmed by verification PCR with primers outside the deletion region. We amplified the
eck1864-66 knockout cassette with the following primers (gene-specific region in bold, kana-
mycin-specific region in regular typeface):
eck1866KO F:

GTAGGCTGGAGCTGCTTCG
eck1864KO R:
TTAACGCAGTCGCCCTCTCGCCAGGTTCAGCCGCGATTCGCTCATCTGCATC
CATATGAATATCCTCCTTAG
Colonies were selected on kanamycin. The clones were colony purified before PCR confir-
mation, then verified by PCR with the following primers:

ECK1866Ver R-CCATTTACTATGACCTGCCA
Microsource Spectrum library screen for trimethoprim’s synergistic
partners
We inoculated either MG1655 wild-type or eck1864-66Δ cells at 1,000 cells per well (200 μl vol-
ume), then added either a vehicle control (DMSO) or small molecule to a final concentration

 of 10 μM per well. Plates were incubated for 18 hours at 37˚C, then OD600 was measured on a
plate reader. Small molecules that inhibited growth by more than 2.5-fold of the standard devi-
ation of growth within each plate were considered significant.
SOS pathway response assays
The plasmid with either GFP expressed under control of the sulA promoter or a promoterless
plasmid containing only the GFP gene was transformed into MG1655 [94]. Strains were then
grown to mid-log in MG1655 (OD600 approximately 0.4), then subcultured to OD600 to inocu-
late the experiment (2 ul into 200 μl M9 medium per well). We then performed a standard
checkerboard assay, reading GFP signal (485 nm excitation and 528 nm emission) and OD600
at 0, 6, and 24 hours. The 24-hour timepoint determined the MIC90 and the difference
between the 0- and 6-hour GFP signals determined the promoter activation.
Bliss independence model of synergy
If a small molecule hit from the Microsource Spectrum library screen did not inhibit E. coli
growth alone, we evaluated its synergistic interaction with trimethoprim by Bliss Indepen-
dence [30] instead of checkerboard analysis. Briefly, we created a gradient of trimethoprim
from 4 to 62.5 μg/ml, then added small molecules of interest at 10 μM or 100 μM. We calcu-
lated percent growth, then determined Bliss Independence by determining whether the growth
inhibition caused by each small molecule alone is equal to the inhibition caused by combina-
tion treatment. If inhibition is greater in the combination, then the molecules act
synergistically.
Growth of E. coli mutants on trimethoprim, AZT, and rifampicin
Strains (S15 Table) were grown in M9 overnight, then diluted to an OD66 of 0.002 and inocu-
lated into 96-well plates at the same density used for MIC and FICI assays. Each 96-well plate
contained a gradient of either AZT, trimethoprim, or rifampicin, serially diluted in 2-fold
increments. After 24 hours at 37˚C, plates were measured in a BioTek Synergy H1. Each well
was then normalized to the no-drug control for each mutant. Percent growth relative to this
control is shown in the heat map. Each assay was repeated 3 times and the data averaged.
Zebrafish (Danio rerio) husbandry
All zebrafish husbandry and experimental procedures were performed in accordance with the
University of Utah and IACUC-approved protocols. Wildtype AB� zebrafish were maintained
as breeding colonies on a 14-hour/10-hour light/dark cycle. Embryos were collected as mixed
egg clutches and raised at 28.5˚C in E3 medium (5 mM NaCl, 0.27 mM KCl, 0.4 mM CaCl2,
0.16 mM MgSO4; pH 7.4) containing 0.000016% methylene blue as an antifungal agent.
Infection of zebrafish embryos
Embryos were anesthetized at 2 days post fertilization (dpf) with tricaine (0.77 mM ethyl
3-aminobenzoate methanesulfonate salt [Sigma-Aldrich]), embedded in 0.8% low-melt aga-
rose without tricaine, and supplemented with E3 media lacking methylene blue. A bacteria cul-
ture of BEC8 or F11 was grown at 37˚C overnight in 12 ml M9 minimal media. Prior to
injection, 1 mL of culture at OD600 = 2.5 to 3.5 for BEC8 or OD600 = 1.7 was created. Filtered
green food dye was added to the culture in a 1:10 dilution. 1 nL was injected into the pericar-
dial cavity of embryos using an Olympus SZ61 stereomicroscope together with a YOU-1
micromanipulator (Narishige), a Narishige IM-200 microinjector, and a JUN-AIR model

 3-compressor. Embryos were left to incubate at 28.5˚C for 3 hours. Small molecules were
mixed with green food dye, and 1 nL was injected into the yolk of embryos at 3 hpi. Dosages
are listed in Table 4. (We estimated embryo mass based on Stehr et al. [95]). Additionally,
drugs were supplemented to water 12 hours after yolk injections (15 hpi). Any embryos that
were physically damaged during the procedures were discarded and excluded from further
analysis. Embryos were unembedded and placed individually in a 96-well plate and left to
incubate in 0.03% Instant Ocean at 28.5˚C until we determined bacterial burden at 24 hpi for
BEC8 or 19 hpi for F11. These timepoints result in comparable bacterial burden in the vehicle-
treated embryos. Bacterial inoculation levels are shown in S4 Fig.
Enumeration of bacterial numbers in zebrafish embryos
Embryos were euthanized at 24 (BEC8) or 19 (F11) hpi, then homogenized in 500 μL of PBS
using a mechanical PRO 250 homogenizer (PRO Scientific). Homogenates were serially
diluted and plated on LB agar plates (F11) or LB agar plates containing ampicillin (BEC8) and
incubated overnight at 37˚C. Any embryos dead and decaying by the euthanasia timepoint
were excluded from further analysis, as survival curves show that dead embryos were rare at
these timepoints [78] and were evenly distributed across treatment groups.
Supporting information
S1 Fig. Other putative synergy prediction mutants do not enrich for trimethoprim synergi-
zers. O2M analysis identified five potential synergy response genes/operons. While a deletion
of the operon eck1864-44 enriched for trimethoprim and sulfamethizole synergizers (Fig 1),
the other potential synergy prediction mutants did not. FICI scores are shown for (A) eck0963
—86D, (B) eck1082-86D, (C) eck1710-13D, and (D) eck3930D. The color scheme is the same as
in Fig 1: predicted synergistic molecules are labeled in green, known synergizers in purple, and
negative control (predicted non-synergizers) in blue. The FICI cutoff for synergy is � 0.5 (red
line) and synergistic FICI values are marked with yellow bars on the graph. Non-synergistic
values are colored blue. None of these mutants enrich for trimethoprim synergizers (p > 0.1
by Fisher’s exact test). The function of these genes/operons are: ECK0963-68: The hydrogenase
1 operon. ECK1082-86: Contains an amino pepidase, and oxidoreductase, and 2-octaprenyl-
6-methoxyphenol hydroxylase, and a protein of unknown function. ECK1710-13: phenylala-
nine-tRNA synthetase subunits and transcriptional regulator. These gene functions do seem
related to any of the functions of our new synergistic pairs. Individual FICI scores are the same
as in Fig 1, since the putative synergy prediction mutants change the category of small mole-
cules (e.g. from predicted synergizer to predicted non-synergizer and vice versa). Thus, the
data for this figure are in S2 Table.

supported by the literature, which shows less than 38% of AZT and 8–12% of fluorouracil (the
active compound of floxuridine) binding to proteins [96]. We similar or slightly increased
MICs for trimethoprim and sulfamethizole with and without serum. Literature shows 40–70%
