OBJECTIVES: Although attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) has been related to 
nutrient deficiencies and “unhealthy” diets, to date there are no studies that examined 
the relationship between the Mediterranean diet and ADHD. We hypothesized that a low 
adherence to a Mediterranean diet would be positively associated with an increase in ADHD 
diagnosis.
METHODS: A total of 120 children and adolescents (60 with newly diagnosed ADHD and 60 
controls) were studied in a sex- and age-matched case-control study. ADHD diagnosis was 
made according to the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, Fourth Edition, 
Text Revision. Energy, dietary intake, adherence to a Mediterranean diet, and familial 
background were measured. Logistic regression was used to determine associations 
between the adherence to a Mediterranean diet and ADHD.
RESULTS: Lower adherence to a Mediterranean diet was associated with ADHD diagnosis 
(odds ratio: 7.07; 95% confidence interval: 2.65–18.84; relative risk: 2.80; 95% confidence 
interval: 1.54–5.25). Both remained significant after adjusting for potential confounders. 
Lower frequency of consuming fruit, vegetables, pasta, and rice and higher frequency 
of skipping breakfast and eating at fast-food restaurants were associated with ADHD 
diagnosis (P < .05). High consumption of sugar, candy, cola beverages, and noncola soft 
drinks (P < .01) and low consumption of fatty fish (P < .05) were also associated with a 
higher prevalence of ADHD diagnosis.
CONCLUSIONS: Although these cross-sectional associations do not establish causality, they raise 
the question of whether low adherence to a Mediterranean diet might play a role in ADHD 
development. Our data support the notion that not only “specific nutrients” but also the 
“whole diet” should be considered in ADHD.

WHAT’S KNOWN ON THIS SUBJECT: Unhealthy 
dietary patterns (usually high in saturated fat, 
refi
 ned sugars, and processed food and low in fruit 
and vegetables) are often associated with attention-
defi
 cit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD).
WHAT THIS STUDY ADDS: A positive relationship 
between a lower adherence to the Mediterranean 
diet and ADHD diagnoses has been found. Not only 
specifi
 c nutrients but also the whole diet should be 
considered in ADHD.

 The etiology of attention-deficit/
hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) 
continues to be debated, although 
several contributing factors have 
been acknowledged, including 
diet. 
1, 
 
2 However, research on the 
relationship between ADHD and 
nutrients and food components 
thus far has yielded inconsistent 
results. 
3, 
 
4 Therefore, a dietary 
approach to ADHD treatment is still 
regarded as controversial without a 
comprehensive evidence base.5 Some 
studies have analyzed the association 
between dietary patterns and 
ADHD. The common finding is that 
unhealthy dietary patterns (ie, high 
in saturated fat and refined sugars 
and low in fruit and vegetables) are 
associated with ADHD. 
6 
 
–

The Mediterranean diet is a healthy, 
well-balanced diet that provides 
most of the nutrients in their right 
proportions. 
10 However, the Spanish 
population is moving away from this 
traditional pattern by increasing 
their consumption of processed foods 
and refined sugars, while decreasing 
vegetable and fruit intakes, 
consequently losing the benefits of 
the Mediterranean diet. 
11 This eating-
pattern change will affect children 
and adolescents the greatest because 
they have the highest nutritional 
needs for optimal growth and 
development. 
8 To our knowledge, 
there are no studies that examined 
the potential relationship between 
adherence to the Mediterranean diet 
and ADHD.
The worldwide pooled prevalence of 
ADHD is reported to be 3.4% (95% 
confidence interval [CI]: 2.6–4.5) in 
children and adolescents, 
 
12 whereas 
in Spain it is reported to be 5% to 
8% in children and 2.5% to 4% in 
adolescents. 
13 The aim of this study 
was to compare dietary intake and 
adherence to a Mediterranean diet 
in Spanish children and adolescents 
newly diagnosed with ADHD 
with that in healthy subjects. We 
hypothesized that a low adherence 
to the Mediterranean diet would be 
associated with an increase in the 
prevalence of ADHD diagnosis.
METHODS
Subjects
From 130 referrals, 60 children and 
adolescents (ages 6–16 years) newly 
diagnosed with ADHD (naive) and 
60 sex- and age-matched controls 
participated in the study ( 
Fig 1). 
Cases were recruited at the ADHD 
Unit of the Department of Child 
and Adolescent Psychiatry and 
Psychology of the Hospital of Sant 
Joan de Deu in Barcelona, Spain. The 
ADHD diagnosis was made according 
to the Diagnostic and Statistical 
Manual of Mental Disorders, Fourth 
Edition, Text Revision. 
14 The ADHD 
Rating-Scale-IV (ADHD RS-IV) for 
parents was used as screening for 
the diagnosis of ADHD. 
15 The Kiddie 
Schedule for Affective Disorders and 
Schizophrenia–Present and Lifetime 
version (K-SADS-PL) was also used 
to confirm the ADHD diagnosis 
and other comorbidities, 
 
16 and 
the Wechsler Intelligence Scale for 
Children–IV (WISC-IV)17 was applied 
to determine IQ. ADHD diagnosis was 
made by experienced psychiatrists.
Exclusion criteria were as follows: 
IQ <70, autism spectrum disorder, 
psychosis, developmental disorders, 
and any ADHD drug treatment 
or nutrient (mineral/vitamin) 
complement. Subjects in whom the 
severity of symptoms was significant 
and in whom a symptomatic 
treatment was needed urgently (eg, 
anxiolytic, antipsychotic) before 
completing the whole evaluation 
process were also excluded.
Controls were recruited from the 
ADHD patients’ classmates (40%) 
and from patients attending other 
hospital services (60%; eg, minor 
surgery, ambulatory). Controls were 
screened for the absence of ADHD 
symptoms and the same exclusion 
criteria were also applied.
Procedure
The study was approved by the 
Ethical Committee of the Hospital 
of Sant Joan de Deu. Written 
informed consent was obtained 
from the participants’ parents, and 
verbal assent was obtained from 
the participants. Demographic and 
clinical data were obtained from both 
subjects and parents. Participants 
underwent a physical examination, 
including height and weight. BMI was 
calculated as weight (kg) divided by 
height (m) squared, and BMI was 
standardized to BMI z score by using 
age and sex. The whole evaluation, 
from the first to the last visit, lasted 
at most 3 weeks ( 
Fig 1).
Assessment of Dietary Intake
Food consumption and nutrient 
intake were measured by a validated 
food-frequency questionnaire 
(FFQ) 
18 administered by a trained 
interviewer. The FFQ comprised 45 
items, including foods and beverages. 
For each food item, participants 
were asked to record their usual 
consumption, ranging from never 
or less than once per month to ≥6 
times per day. In addition, a 24-hour 
recall interview was conducted by 
telephone. Total energy and nutrient 
intakes were analyzed by using 
the nutritional evaluation software 
program PCN Pro version 1.32. 
19, 
 
20 
According to Willett et al, 
 
21 an 
adjustment of total energy was made 
for independent variables by using 
the nutrient residual model (adjusted 
for energy), taking into consideration 
that most nutrients are positively 
correlated with energy intake, which 
could introduce a confounding factor. 
The Willett’s methodology allows the 
calculation of the effect of a specific 
nutrient beyond any effect due to 
energy intake.
Assessment of Adherence to the 
Mediterranean Diet
The KIDMED test 
22 was used to 
evaluate the adherence to the 
Mediterranean diet. KIDMED test is

 based on the principles 
that sustain Mediterranean 
dietary patterns and those that 
undermine it. Items denoting lower 
adherence were assigned a 
value of −1 and those related to 
higher adherence were scored +1. 
Scores range from −4 to 12, with 
higher scores indicating greater 
adherence to the Mediterranean 
diet.
Physical Activity
Participants used the actigraph 
ActiSleep (ActiGraph, Pensacola, 
FL) on their nondominant 
wrist continuously for 7 days 
to measure rates of physical 
activity.
Biochemical Parameters
Fasting blood samples were obtained 
by venipuncture in the forearm 
of each participant. Plasma iron, 
ferritin, transferrin, and zinc were 
determined in the Laboratory of 
Biochemistry of the Hospital of Sant 
Joan de Deu.
Statistical Analyses
Continuous variables were 
expressed as means (SDs) or 
medians (interquartile ranges, 
25th–75th percentile), whereas 
categorical variables were 
expressed as percentages. 
Differences in normally and 
nonnormally distributed continuous 
variables were compared by using 
the Student’s t test and the Mann-
Whitney U test, respectively. 
Categorical variables were 
compared by using the χ2 test. 
Logistic regression was used to 
examine associations between 
the score (after calculating 
tertiles) of the adherence to the 
Mediterranean diet and the odds 
of ADHD diagnosis. In addition, 
the odds of ADHD diagnosis were 
estimated according to tertiles of 
the intake of food groups whose 
consumption differed between cases 
and controls, to determine whether 
any key food group could explain 
any significant relationship with 
ADHD. The relative risk (RR) was 
also computed as the rate for the 
lowest adherence divided by that 
for the highest adherence to the 
Mediterranean diet. Analyses were 
performed by using the SPSS 21.0 
statistical software package (SPSS, 
Inc, Chicago, IL) and the R package 
mmeta (The R Project for Statistical 
Computing, The R Foundation). 
P ≤ .05 was considered statistically 
significant.

 were breastfed was the same in both 
groups. Significant differences were 
also observed for variables related to 
familial background. With regard to 
nutrient plasma levels, no statistically 
significant differences were found, 
even though cases showed slightly 
lower plasma concentrations of 
iron and ferritin. On the other hand, 
the cases showed an average value 
of ADHD-Rating Scale (Diagnostic 
and Statistical Manual of Mental 
Disorders, Fourth Edition) of 34.2 
(9.7), and the K-SADS-PL confirmed 
the diagnosis of all of the cases. 
With regard to comorbid diagnoses, 
33.3% of patients with ADHD met 
cutoff criteria for oppositional defiant 
disorder (ODD), 23.3% for anxiety, 
3.3% for conduct disorder, and 1.7% 
for depression.
ADHD Is Associated With a Lower 
Adherence to the Mediterranean 
Diet
Children and adolescents with ADHD 
showed statistically significant 
lower scores of adherence to a 
Mediterranean diet than controls 
( 
Table 2). Within the subjects with 
ADHD, no significant differences in 
KIDMED scores were observed in 
those patients with comorbidities 
such as anxiety (ADHD without 
anxiety versus ADHD with anxiety: 
6.5 [2.0] vs 5.5 [2.0]; P = .096) or 
ODD (ADHD without ODD versus 
ADHD with ODD: 6.0 [2.1] vs 6.5 
[1.7]; P = .132). When compared with 
controls, the percentages of subject 
with ADHD who consume a second 
serving of fruit every day, of fresh or 
cooked vegetables daily or more than 
once a day, and pasta or rice almost 
every day were significantly lower 
( 
Table 2). In addition, the percentage 
of subjects with ADHD who ate more 
frequently at a fast-food restaurant 
was higher than that of controls. 
In addition, the percentage of 
subjects who skipped breakfast was 
significantly higher for the cases. 
However, no statistically significant 
differences were observed with 
respect to the consumption of fish, 
dairy, and cereal products or baked 
goods.
Statistical differences were found 
between children and adolescents 
with or without ADHD regarding 
some food group intakes ( 
Table 3). 
Cases consumed fewer vegetables, 
citrus fruits, and fatty fish but larger 
amounts of noncola soft drinks, cola 
beverages, sugar, and candy than 
controls. Moreover, individuals 
with ADHD consumed statistically 
higher amounts of simple sugars and 
caffeine and lower amounts of total 
protein than controls. On the other 
hand, no significant differences were 
found for total daily energy intake 
or other nutrient intakes, including 
iron and zinc, which are commonly 
related to ADHD.
We further compared low, 
medium, and high adherence to 
the Mediterranean diet with ADHD 
diagnoses ( 
Table 4). Children and 
adolescents with a low adherence 
to the Mediterranean diet were 
more likely to be associated with 
an ADHD diagnosis in the crude 
model (P < .001). The RR was 
also significant (RR: 2.80; 95% CI: 
1.54–5.25). Both odds ratios and 
RRs remained significant after 
adjusting for potential confounding 
variables, such as BMI, level of 
physical activity, breastfeeding, 
maternal smoking during pregnancy, 
maternal educational level, paternal 
educational level, biological father 
living with family, and parents 
divorced. When examining the 
consumption of specific food groups 
and ADHD diagnosis, an intake 
in the low tertile of vegetables, 
citrus fruit, and fatty fish was 
associated with ADHD diagnosis 
in the crude model ( 
Table 4). 
Further adjustment for potential 
confounding variables attenuated 
the association with the exception 
of fatty fish consumption, which 
remained statistically significant. 
On the other hand, subjects with 
an intake in the highest tertile for

 sugar and candy, cola beverages, and 
noncola soft drinks were associated 
with a higher prevalence of ADHD 
diagnosis ( 
Table 4). The association 
remained significant after adjusting 
for confounding variables.
DISCUSSION
This is the first study to show that 
low adherence to the Mediterranean 
diet is associated with odds of 
an ADHD diagnosis in children 
and adolescents. This association 
remained significant after adjusting 
for confounding variables. Among 
the habits that characterize a 
Mediterranean dietary pattern, 
individuals with ADHD more often 
missed having a second serving 
of fruit daily and showed reduced 
intakes of vegetables, pasta, 
and rice almost every day when 
compared with controls. Moreover, 
subjects with ADHD ate at fast-food 
restaurants and skipped breakfast 
more often than controls. In addition, 
a high consumption of sugar and 
candy, cola beverages, and noncola 
soft drinks and a low consumption of 
fatty fish were also associated with a 
higher prevalence of ADHD diagnosis.
Several advantages supporting the 
study of dietary pattern versus 
single nutrients in health promotion, 
including mental health, have 
previously been discussed. 
2, 
 
23 It 
seems that in addition to analyzing 
the impact that a single food 
component may have on ADHD, the 
role of dietary patterns as a whole 
can be more informative. Some 
studies have analyzed different 
types of dietary patterns, but none 
specifically on the Mediterranean 
diet. In a cohort of Australian 
adolescents, 
 
6 a dietary pattern 
identified as the “Western” type 
was significantly associated with 
ADHD diagnosis. Similarly, in a cross-
sectional study in Iranian children, 
a greater adherence to fast-food 
and sweet dietary patterns was 
associated with a higher prevalence 
of ADHD. 
7 Recently, in a case-
control study in Korean children, the 
traditional-healthy dietary pattern, 
characterized by high intakes of 
kimchi, grains, and bonefish and low 
intakes of fast foods and beverages, 
was associated with a lower 
probability of ADHD diagnosis.9 
Moreover, other studies have 
confirmed that skipping breakfast 
or substituting it for a sugary drink 
impairs attention and episodic 
memory in children. 
24 Therefore, 
low-quality diets are persistently 
associated with a higher risk of 
ADHD. Consistent with this finding, 
a clinical trial examining the effect 
of overall dietary characteristics in 
medicated children with ADHD found 
that a balanced diet, regular meals, 
and a high intake of dairy products 
and vegetables were associated 
with fewer attention and behavioral 
problems. 
25
Although the mechanisms linking 
low-quality diet and ADHD are still 
unknown, an unbalanced diet can 
lead to deficiencies in essential 
nutrients or higher intakes of 
certain food components (ie, food 
additives). 
26 There are numerous 
potential biological pathways by 
which diet quality may have an 
impact on mental health.

 and physical growth, are cofactors 
for dopamine and norepinephrine 
production, both of which play an 
essential role in the etiology of ADHD. 
Low plasma levels of iron, ferritin, 
and zinc 
28– 
30 have been found in 
children with ADHD. However, in 
our study, no significant differences 
regarding the intakes of those 
nutrients or their serum levels were 
observed between cases and controls. 
Donfrancesco et al 
31 concluded that 
normal ferritin levels should not 
suggest that iron deficiency is not 
involved in the pathophysiology 
of ADHD. Indeed, serum ferritin is 
a marker of peripheral, but not of 
brain, iron status, in which iron is 
necessary as a cofactor. The extent 
to which serum ferritin correlates 
with iron levels in the brain remains 
unclear. 
32 Omega-3 fatty acids seem 
also to have a relationship with 
ADHD. Two recent meta-analyses 
reported a small but beneficial effect 
of omega-3 supplementation on 
reducing symptoms of ADHD. 
5, 
33, 
 
34 
However, this finding is not entirely 
supported by the current evidence 
as a primary treatment of ADHD. 
35 
In this study, it was not possible 
to estimate omega-3 intake among 
controls and cases because the 
Spanish food-composition tables 
20 
do not contain information about 
omega-3 fatty acids. Nonetheless, we 
found that fatty fish intake, which 
is the main source of long-chain 
polyunsaturated omega-3 fatty acids 
in the Spanish diet, was significantly 
lower in cases than in controls.
The observed relationship between 
intakes in the highest tertile of sugary 
products and increased odds for 
ADHD is in line with the findings of 
other studies. 
6, 
 
9 It is possible that 
a high intake of these low-nutrient 
products could indicate a poor 
micronutrient intake. Two recent 
studies found that vitamin and 
mineral supplementation resulted 
in significant reductions in ADHD 
symptoms in both children and 
adults with ADHD. 
36, 
 
37 In the case 
of children, these reductions were 
reversed when the treatment was 
withdrawn. This kind of approach 
makes physiologic sense, considering 
that nutrients are required for 
many critical biochemical reactions 
and because it is unlikely that 1 
nutrient by itself would resolve all 
vulnerabilities present in a complex 
disorder such as ADHD.38
We cannot overlook that the 
relationship found between diet 
and ADHD could represent reverse 
causation. 
6 Individuals with 
ADHD are often characterized by 
impulsivity traits and emotional 
distress 
39 that may lead to poor 
dietary choices (ie, fat-rich or 
sugar-rich snack foods) to balance 
their emotions as a form of self-
medication. 
27, 
 
40 In our population, 
we found that the intake of 
sugary beverages and foods was 
significantly higher in cases than in 
controls, and those higher intakes 
were reflected in a larger amount 
of sugar intake. On the other hand, 
the role of the family cannot be 
dismissed considering that a 
healthy diet is related to a better 
functioning family.41, 
 
42 Parents 
of individuals with ADHD often 
report a more dysfunctional family 
environment, 
 
39, 
 
43, 
 
44 so it is plausible 
that the relationship between 
low adherence to a healthy diet 
and ADHD diagnosis may be 
exacerbated by a dysfunctional

 family environment.6 All of these 
factors could support a vicious cycle: 
impulsiveness and family dysfunction 
could lead to a worse choice of foods, 
lowering the diet quality, which 
eventually could lead to a low intake 
of certain nutrients. This situation 
may induce certain nutritional 
subclinical deficiencies and, hence, 
worsen ADHD symptoms.
The statistical differences in BMI 
and z scores found between cases 
and controls deserve discussion 
even though physical activity was 
higher in cases than in controls, 
although the energy intake was 
similar in both groups. Our findings 
are in line with a recent study, which 
provided meta-analytic evidence for 
a significant association between 
ADHD and obesity/overweight and 
postulated that the impulsivity and 
inattention that characterize ADHD 
might lead to deregulated eating 
patterns and, consequently, weight 
gain. 
45 Another possible explanation 
is the “thrifty” phenotype theory, 
which proposes a mechanism of 
early programming in which a wide 
range of environmental conditions 
before and during pregnancy 
determine susceptibility to disease 
later in life. 
46 Several studies have 
shown that children whose mothers 
smoke during pregnancy are at an 
elevated risk of being overweight. 
46 
In our work, we observed a higher 
percentage of maternal smoking 
during pregnancy in cases compared 
with controls.
Finally, the significant differences 
observed for other indicators of 
certain social disadvantages (ie, 
maternal and/or paternal education 
and single parenthood) or maternal 
prenatal smoking or insufficient 
breastfeeding are in accordance with 
data previously published. 
42, 
 
47 
– 
49 
The association between 
insufficient breastfeeding and ADHD 
development suggests a “chicken-
and-egg” question of which came 
first, the disorder or the inability to 
be breastfed, because infants who 
appear to reject the breast might 
show an early manifestation of a 
neuropsychiatric disorder, such as 
ADHD.41
Some limitations of our design and 
methods should be acknowledged, 
such as the case-control study 
design, which prevents our ability to 
assess cause-and-effect associations. 
Furthermore, all dietary instruments, 
such as FFQs, that measure past food 
intake are vulnerable both to random 
and systematic measurement errors. 
Nonetheless, this study has several 
important strengths, including the 
fact that all of the cases included 
were naive, taking no medication. 
The use of certain drugs might affect 
the food choices and provoke changes 
in the child’s and adolescent’s diet. In 
addition, well-trained, experienced 
psychiatrists and psychologists 
performed the evaluation.
CONCLUSIONS
We found a positive relationship 
between a lower adherence 
to the Mediterranean diet and 
ADHD diagnoses. The current 
findings suggest that certain 
dietary habits may play a role 
in ADHD development, even 
though further work is required 
to investigate causality and to 
determine if dietary manipulation 
could reverse the symptoms of 
ADHD, taking into consideration

 all potential factors. Therefore, 
our main recommendation is that 
clinicians focus on diet not with 
the expectation of dietary changes 
improving behavior but with the 
concern that children with ADHD are 
more likely to be eating unhealthy 
diets; this component should 
therefore be part of the evaluation to 
improve their health.
