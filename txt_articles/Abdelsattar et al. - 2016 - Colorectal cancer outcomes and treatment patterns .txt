Abstract
Background—The proportion of cancer cases in younger patients is increasing though colorectal 
cancer (CRC) screening guidelines recommend starting at age 50. The national treatment patterns 
and outcomes of these patients are largely unknown.
Methods—This is a population-based retrospective cohort study of the nationally representative 
Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results registry for patients diagnosed with CRC from 
1998-2011. Patients were categorized as being younger or older than the recommended screening 
age. Differences in stage at diagnosis, patterns of therapy, and disease-specific survival were 
compared between age groups using multinomial regression, multiple regression, cox-proportional 
hazards regression, and Weibull survival analysis.
Results—Of 258,024 CRC patients, 37,847 (15%) were younger than 50. Young patients were 
more likely to present with regional (Relative risk ratio [RRR]: 1.3, p<0.001) or distant (RRR: 1.5, 
p<0.001) disease. CRC patients with distant metastasis were more likely to receive surgical 
therapy for their primary tumor in the younger age group (adjusted probability: 72% vs. 63%; 
p<0.001), and radiation therapy was more likely in younger RC patients (adjusted probability: 
53% vs. 48%; p<0.001). Patients younger than screening age had better overall disease-specific

 survival (Hazard ratio: 0.77; p<0.001), despite a larger proportion presenting with advanced 
disease.
Conclusions—Colorectal cancer patients diagnosed before age 50 are more likely to present 
with advanced stage disease. However, they receive more aggressive therapy and achieve longer 
disease-specific survival, despite the greater proportion with advanced-stage disease. These 
findings suggest the need for improved risk assessment and screening decisions for younger 
adults.

Introduction
Although colorectal cancer (CRC) is primarily thought of as a disease of older adults, this 
paradigm is changing. CRC is increasingly being diagnosed in young adults,1 who are too 
young for average-risk screening (age <50).2 In fact, it is estimated that, despite an aging 
population, by the year 2030, more than 1 in 10 colon cancers and nearly 1 in 4 rectal 
cancers will be diagnosed in individuals younger than 50 years of age.1 Current screening 
guidelines recommend against routine screening for “average-risk” individuals under the age 
of 50 years, thus younger patients are often diagnosed only after they become symptomatic. 
Indeed, several studies have demonstrated that young CRC patients are more likely to 
present with advanced disease.3–7
However, the current treatment patterns and the resultant outcomes in young CRC patients 
are not clear. With modern therapeutic strategies, the potential survival benefit of curative 
therapy for CRC in younger patients is great, but their outcomes may be worse if they are 
diagnosed at a later stage. The literature on this is divergent, and is limited by studies from 
single centers with smaller non-population-based samples,3,7,8 or older reports that do not 
capture modern therapeutic practices.5,6 Younger patients may also be candidates for more 
aggressive therapy in the absence of frailty and multiple morbidity.
In this context, we performed a population-based, nationally representative cohort study. We 
specifically examine the effect of having a diagnosis of CRC before the routine screening 
age of 50 years on: 1) disease stage at presentation; 2) treatment patterns by stage; and 3) 
adjusted cancer-specific survival. We hypothesize that younger patients are at higher risk of 
having advanced disease at diagnosis, but that they may achieve longer survival through the 
receipt of more aggressive therapy.
Methods
We conducted a retrospective cohort study using the Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End 
Results (SEER) database.9 The SEER database is the authoritative source for cancer 
incidence, survival, and prevalence, currently capturing 28% of the US population, and is 
representative of geographic, racial, and ethnic diversity. SEER collects demographic 
information (e.g., age, sex, and race/ ethnicity) and clinical information (e.g., primary tumor

 location, tumor histology, stage, treatment, and survival) from 18 cancer registries. 
Institutional Review Board approval is not required for publicly available data.
Patient Population
All patients age 20-79 years, who were diagnosed with histologically confirmed colon or 
rectal cancer based on Classification of Diseases for Oncology (ICD-O) site and histology 
codes between 1/1998 and 12/2011 were included. Patients for whom this was not their first 
and only malignancy were excluded.
Main Exposure Variable
Patients were categorized according to the age at which initiation of average-risk CRC 
screening is recommended into two groups – those 50 years or older and those younger than 
50 years of age. This age cut-off is ubiquitously accepted as the age for which average-risk 
screening begins.2
Statistical Analyses
Baseline clinical and demographic patient characteristics by age category were compared 
using chi square tests for categorical variables and two-way t-tests for continuous variables, 
with significance set at p<0.05.
First, we examined the association between the two age categories and the stage at 
presentation. We used the SEER “summary stage A” variable to stratify patients into those 
with: Localized disease which refers to disease confined to the colon or rectum; Regional 
disease which refers to contiguous and adjacent organ spread (e.g., lymph nodes, kidney, 
and pelvic wall); and Distant disease which refers to remote metastases. This variable is the 
most consistently captured variable in the SEER dataset. A multinomial logistic regression 
model was constructed adjusting for age, sex, race/ethnicity, marital status, tumor location, 
and year of diagnosis.10–12 The model yielded adjusted odds ratios (aOR) and their 95% 
confidence intervals (95% CI) for each covariate and its association with regional or distant 
disease as compared to localized disease stage at presentation.
Second, we examined the association between the two age categories and the receipt of 
cancer-directed surgery or radiation using logistic regression models, which adjusted for the 
variables in the previous model in addition to the stage at presentation. The β coefficients of 
the covariates generated by the multivariable model allow for the calculation of an adjusted 
rate for the receipt of cancer-directed therapy for each age category. This is achieved by 
fixing the value of the exposure variable for each patient while keeping all other covariate 
values as observed.
Lastly, we examined the association between the two age groups and 5-year cancer-specific 
survival. We used multivariable Cox proportional hazards models to obtain adjusted hazard 
ratios (aHR) and their 95% CI's, while accounting for sex, race/ethnicity, marital status, 
tumor location, stage, receipt of cancer-directed surgery or radiation, and year of diagnosis. 
We also used Weibull survival analyses to obtain adjusted cancer-specific survival estimates

 stratified by the stage at presentation for each age category, while accounting for the above 
listed variables in addition to the interaction between age and stage at diagnosis.
All statistical tests were two-sided and p-values<0.05 were considered significant. Statistical 
analyses were conducted using STATA special edition (version 13.1, StataCorp, College 
Station, TX).
Results
Of 258,024 patients with histologically confirmed colon or rectal cancer from 1998 to 2011, 
37,847 (14.7%) patients were too young for average-risk screening at a mean age of 42.5 
±6.0 years. There was a nearly 1:1 male-to-female ratio between the two age groups. 
Compared to their older counterparts, these patients were more likely to be of African 
American race (14.8% vs. 12%) or American Indian/AK native or Asian/Pacific Islander 
(10.6% vs. 8.5%; all p<0.001). Younger patients were also less likely to have right-sided 
colon cancer (20% vs. 31.1%; p<0.001) and generally more likely to have had rectal cancer 
(31.2% vs. 22.4%) as noted in Table 1.
After adjusting for sex, race, marital status, tumor location and year of diagnosis, younger 
patients were significantly more likely to present with regional disease than localized 
disease (RRR=1.37, p<0.001) and even more likely to present with distant disease than 
localized disease (RRR=1.58, p<0.001) compared to their older counterparts (Table 2). Of 
note, patients with rectal cancer were significantly less likely to present with advanced 
stages, compared to patients with colon cancer. The multinomial regression model allows 
for the calculation of adjusted proportions of stages at presentation by age category and 
Figure 1 portrays theses differences in stage at diagnosis between the two age groups (all 
p<0.001).
Table 3 shows the adjusted rates of receiving cancer-directed therapy by stage for both age 
categories and accounting for sex, race/ethnicity, marital status, tumor location, and year of 
diagnosis. While the majority of patients receive surgery for their primary tumor, younger 
patients with distant disease are more likely to receive cancer-directed surgery on their 
primary (70.8% vs 66.6%, p<0.001) than their older counterparts. The differences are more 
pronounced for receiving cancer-directed radiation where young patients with rectal cancer 
are more likely to receive radiation therapy for all stages (all p<0.001).
Overall crude 5-year survival for young patients and all stages combined was 67.7% vs. 
66.8% for patients ≥ 50 years (p=0.008). However, notable differences are seen after 
comparing survival stage-for-stage and adjusting for sex, race, marital status, tumor location, 
stage, receipt of cancer-directed surgery or radiation, and year of diagnosis. The stage-for-
stage effect of being too young for average-risk screening on adjusted 5-year cancer-specific 
survival is shown in Figure 2. These results show that adjusted cancer-specific survival is 
better in younger patients, across all stage groups. The 5-year cancer-specific survival for 
patients too young for average-risk screening was 95.1% vs. 91.9% for patients 50 and older 
(p<0.001) for localized disease, 76% vs. 70.3% (p<0.001) for regional disease, and 21.3% 
vs. 14.1% (p<0.001) for distant disease, respectively.

 Discussion
In this nationally representative study, we found differences in CRC outcomes and treatment 
patterns in patients too young for average-risk screening compared to patients 50 years and 
older. Importantly, we found that nearly 1 in 7 CRC patients were younger than 50. Our 
study confirms that these patients were more likely to present with advanced stage disease, 
for which they received more aggressive cancer-directed therapy, and that they achieved 
longer cancer-specific survival. These results forecast the imminent demand for unique 
survivorship care in these young, aggressively treated patients.
In the present study young patients were more likely to present with advanced stage disease, 
which may largely be explained by the fact that current screening guidelines do not 
recommend routine screening for this seemingly low-risk population.2 These results mirror 
what we are seeing in our clinical practice: an increasing number of very young patients 
with colorectal cancer, often symptomatic and with a delay in diagnosis. This emphasizes 
the need for close attention to young patients who present with hematochezia, anemia or a 
change in bowel habit, and raises the importance of public and medical community 
awareness of the increasing prevalence of CRC in younger patients.1,4,7 Exactly when young 
patients with gastrointestinal symptoms should undergo colonoscopy remains to be decided.
The stage-specific treatment patterns for younger patients are noteworthy. Receipt of cancer-
directed surgery for localized and regional CRC was similar between the two age groups, 
but a higher rate of surgery on the primary tumor was noted for younger patients with distant 
CRC. Recently, Hu and colleagues13 demonstrated that utilization of primary tumor 
resection in CRC patients with distant disease is decreasing with the advent of effective 
systemic chemotherapy. The present study demonstrates the potential over-use of primary 
tumor resection specifically in younger patients. This may be due to more frequent 
symptomatic or emergent presentations, and it is also plausible that younger CRC patients 
and their surgeons have increased willingness to pursue more aggressive forms of therapy 
than older patients,3 especially that their ability to safely tolerate and complete treatments is 
likely higher. This phenomenon is also evident for receipt of radiation therapy, which was 
notably more frequently utilized in younger patients with RC across all stages. This finding 
is complimentary to a different study by Kneuertz and colleagues14 that demonstrate more 
intense use of multi-agent chemotherapy in young colon cancer patients. Although SEER 
does not have data on chemotherapy use, the present study adds to the growing literature on 
the patterns of therapy of CRC and that younger patients are indeed treated more 
aggressively.
Despite presenting with more advanced disease, we find that younger patients do not suffer 
inferior survival estimates compared to their older counterparts. On the contrary, five-year 
survival was greater for younger patients, both stage-for-stage and overall, perhaps 
associated with the more aggressive approach to therapy for advanced stage disease. 
However, the paradoxically superior survival of the young colorectal cancer patients was not 
due to improved survival only for advanced stage patients, but rather was a phenomenon 
present across stages.

 This study has several limitations. First, we cannot ascertain causation from this 
observational study, as overall survival and treatment choice is subject to considerable 
selection bias that cannot be entirely mitigated with risk adjustment. It is also possible that a 
higher proportion of young CRC patients have a hereditary cancer syndrome, and CRC 
associated with such syndromes may behave less aggressively.15,16 We were unable to 
evaluate this point specifically as cancer genetics and family history are significant risk 
factors for CRC,17 but are not available in SEER. Finally, although there were more African 
Americans in the younger age group, the magnitude of this difference cannot in and of itself 
explain the marked differences in incidence and survival, knowing that African Americans 
are at an inherently increased risk for CRC.18 Notwithstanding these limitations, the findings 
are informative and relevant as the national patterns of care and cancer outcomes are largely 
unknown for this growing patient population.
From a policy standpoint, these findings suggest the need to improve current medical 
practice, and to study the possibility of changing screening practices. In the realm of current 
practice improvement, this study is a wake-up call to the medical community regarding the 
increasing prevalence of CRC in young patients. We must avoid the currently common 
delay in diagnosis for young patients with red-flag symptoms of CRC such as a change in 
bowel habit or hematochezia not typical of a benign anorectal source. In addition, more 
attention to patients' family history, as the most identifiable clinical risk factor, would reveal 
many non-average-risk patients not currently undergoing earlier age screening, for whom it 
would be recommended.
Unfortunately, it is not clear from this study or other published studies how to target 
“average-risk” patients for whom earlier-age CRC screening would be appropriate. Future 
clinical and basic science research will be required to identify characteristics of early-onset 
CRC patients without a family history that might be useful for risk-stratification. We can 
imagine a future in which more universal genetic testing for cancer and other disease risk 
factors would allow for such risk stratification. For average-risk screening, the increasing 
rate of early-onset CRC would suggest that we should consider low-cost/low-risk screening 
with a fecal immunochemical test kits or fecal DNA tests for the entire population at an 
earlier age (e.g., 40 or 45 years). The cost-effectiveness of such a strategy could be formally 
tested in future studies.
In conclusion, in this nationally representative study nearly 1 in 7 CRC patients were 
diagnosed before the age of average risk screening. A diagnosis of CRC in this population is 
associated with a higher likelihood for advanced stage disease, more aggressive cancer-
directed therapy, and a slightly better cancer-specific prognosis suggesting some 
compensation for later diagnosis. These results suggest the need for future research on the 
cost-effectiveness of earlier-age screening policies for CRC with low-risk/low-cost fecal 
testing, and further research on survivorship care in these young, aggressively treated 
patients.
