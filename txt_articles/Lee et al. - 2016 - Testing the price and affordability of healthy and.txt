healthy and current (unhealthy) diets and
the potential impacts of policy change in
Australia

Abstract
Background: Price and affordability of foods are important determinants of health. Targeted food pricing policies
may help improve population diets. However, methods producing comparable data to inform relevant policy
decisions are lacking in Australia and globally. The objective was to develop and pilot standardised methods to
assess the price, relative price and affordability of healthy (recommended) and current (unhealthy) diets and test
impacts of a potential policy change.
Methods: Methods followed the optimal approach proposed by INFORMAS using recent Australian dietary intake
data and guidelines. Draft healthy and current (unhealthy) diet baskets were developed for five household
structures. Food prices were collected in stores in a high and low SES location in Brisbane, Australia. Diet prices
were calculated and compared with household incomes, and with potential changes to the Australian Taxation
System. Wilcoxen-signed rank tests were used to compare differences in price.
Results: The draft tools and protocols were deemed acceptable at household level, but methods could be refined.
All households spend more on current (unhealthy) diets than required to purchase healthy (recommended) diets,
with the majority (53–64 %) of the food budget being spent on ‘discretionary’ choices, including take-away foods
and alcohol. A healthy diet presently costs between 20–31 % of disposable income of low income households, but
would become unaffordable for these families under proposed changes to expand the GST to apply to all foods in
Australia.
Conclusions: Results confirmed that diet pricing methods providing meaningful, comparable data to inform
potential fiscal and health policy actions can be developed, but draft tools should be refined. Results suggest that
healthy diets can be more affordable than current (unhealthy) diets in Australia, but other factors may be as
important as price in determining food choices.

 Background
Unhealthy diets are now the major preventable risk fac-
tor contributing to the burden of disease in globally and
in Australia [1] and are driven by ‘obesogenic’ food envi-
ronments affecting food promotion, availability, accessi-
bility and affordability [2]. Data from the Australian
Health Survey 2011-12 [3] show that less than seven
percent of Australians consume diets consistent with the
recommendations of the Australian Dietary Guidelines
(ADGs) 2013; [4] at least 35 % of the energy intake of
adults and at least 39 % of the energy intake of children
are now derived from unhealthy ‘discretionary’ choices
[3], described by the Australian National Health and
Medical Research Council as foods and drinks high in
saturated fat, added sugar, salt and/or alcohol that are
not required for health [4]. Of concern is the contribu-
tion of poor diet to the rising rates of overweight and
obesity; [4] 25 % of Australian children and 63 % of Aus-
tralian adults are now overweight or obese [3]. There is
an urgent need for nutrition policy actions that can help
shift the current intake of the whole population to a
healthier diet consistent with dietary recommendations
in Australia [4].
Assessing diet price and affordability
The public perception that healthy foods are expensive
is believed to be a key factor contributing to poor dietary
choices and diet-related health inequities [4–6]. In devel-
oped countries, greater total spending on food tends to
be associated with more nutritious dietary patterns [7].
If populations were to follow dietary recommendations,
this may lead to higher food costs, with those house-
holds with the lowest incomes being most vulnerable, as
they spend less per person on food, but a greater pro-
portion of their total expenditure on food [7].
However, as the relative price of ‘healthy’ and ‘un-
healthy’ foods depends on the unit of measure (i.e., per
energy unit, nutrient density, serve or weight) [7], it is
not always clear whether ‘healthy’ foods are really more
expensive than ‘unhealthy’ foods, (e.g., healthy foods
such as fruit have a high energy-to-price ratio but can
provide specific nutrients at a much lower price than
other less healthy foods). Comparisons can be difficult
particularly in the context of the total, habitual diet that
is the major determinant of diet-related disease [1, 2, 4].
Moreover, as opposed to selected pairs of ‘healthy’ and
‘less healthy’ foods, the relative price and affordability of
current (unhealthy) and healthy (recommended) diets
rarely have been assessed [7].
The International Network for Food and Obesity/non-
communicable diseases (NCDs) Research, Monitoring
and Action Support (INFORMAS), a global network of
public-interest organisations and researchers that aims
to monitor, benchmark and support public and private
sector actions to create healthy food environments (i.e.,
with respect to food composition, labelling, promotion,
provision, retailing, price and affordability, and trade and
investment) and reduce obesity and non-communicable
diseases (NCDs) and their related inequalities [2], has
highlighted the need for these data [7]. INFORMAS has
identified that, with respect to food price and affordabil-
ity, the relevant questions which need to be answered to
inform public policy are:
� What is the relative price and affordability of
‘current’ (unhealthy) and ‘healthy’ (recommended)
diets?; and
� What would be the effect of potential policy actions
on the relative price and affordability of ‘current’
(unhealthy) and ‘healthy’ (recommended) diets? [7]
INFORMAS proposes a step-wise framework, com-
prising ‘minimal’
, ‘expanded’ and ‘optimal’ approaches, to
monitor price and affordability of the components of
‘healthy’ and ‘less healthy’ diets, that takes into account
differences in the available capacity, infrastructure and
resources of countries to answer these questions and
conduct monitoring activities. The framework is de-
scribed in detail elsewhere [7].
In Australia, as globally, there are no standardized
tools and protocols to assess and compare the price and
affordability of healthy (recommended) and current (un-
healthy) diets [7]. Various Australian jurisdictions and
research groups apply different food baskets as dietary
survey instruments, and more than ten different instru-
ments and methods are currently in use [5, 6, 8–16].
None of these accurately reflect current Australian diets
[3], nor are entirely consistent with current dietary rec-
ommendations [4, 17] (with exception of the recently re-
vised
Queensland methodology [16]). The ‘optimal’
approach of the INFORMAS diet price and affordability
framework potentially provides the basis to develop a
standardized method to assess and compare the price
and affordability of healthy (recommended) and current
(unhealthy) diets in Australia.
Potential policy actions to improve affordability of
healthy diets
A range of inter-related factors influence food prices, in-
cluding political, economic, socio-cultural and environmen-
tal factors at the local, national and international levels [18,
19]. Food prices may be manipulated by governments
through a range of complex policy approaches [19]. Three
common pricing strategies to increase the affordability of
‘healthy’ foods at a state or national level are [7]:
(i) taxes on ‘unhealthy’ foods e.g., on sugar-sweetened
beverages;
Lee et al. BMC Public Health  (2016) 16:315 
Page 2 of 22
 (ii)exemption of ‘healthy’ foods from goods and service
tax (GST) or value added tax; and
(iii)
subsidies on ‘healthy’ foods such as agricultural and
transport subsidies, retail price reductions, or
voucher systems targeted to high-risk groups.
In Australia, basic healthy foods (such as fruit, vegeta-
bles, bread, fresh meat, milk and eggs) are currently ex-
empt from GST, which is applied at a rate of 10 % to all
other foods and drinks [20]. The GST status of specific
food items in Australia can be determined online at the
Australian Taxation Office calculator website [21]. Des-
pite basic healthy foods being exempt from GST in
Australia, the limited available (non-comparable) data
suggest that the cost of ‘healthy’ food is higher [5] and
has increased more rapidly than the cost of ‘unhealthy’
food over the last 15 years [14, 16]. Similar findings have
been described internationally [7, 22].
As a revenue raising measure, the Australian Govern-
ment has proposed expanding the GST base by remov-
ing exemption of basic healthy foods and/or increasing
the rate of GST above 10 % [20]. While the potential ef-
fects of these proposed changes on the price of specific,
selected foods have been modelled [23, 24], the potential
impact on price and affordability of total current and
recommended diets has not been determined.
Aim
This study pilots the development and testing of draft
tools and protocols with the potential to be standardized
nationally, consistent with the INFORMAS ‘optimal’
approach [7], to investigate the price, relative price and
affordability of healthy (recommended) and current
(unhealthy) diets in Australia. It also tests the utility of
these methods in determining the effect of potential
fiscal policy actions by investigating, as an example, the
impacts of the mooted broadening and/or raising of
the GST base in Australia on the relative price and
affordability of current (unhealthy) and healthy (rec-
ommended) diets.
Methods
Construction of the draft diet basket pricing tools
Diet baskets were developed for five different household
types and structures, in expansion of the one reference
household proposed by the INFORMAS approach, to
encompass the major options used previously in food
price surveys in Australian states and territories and
optimize utility: [6, 9, 12, 14, 16]
� Household 1 (HH1) (n = 6): adult male 31–50 year
old; adult female 31–50 year old; older female 70+
yrs old; boy 14 years old; girl 8 years old; boy 4
years old
� Household 2 (HH2) (n = 3): single parent with 2
children: adult female 31–50 year old; boy 14 years
old; girl 8 years old
� Household 3 (HH3) (n = 1): single unemployed
person: adult male 31–50 year old
� Household 4 (HH4) (n = 2): older couple with no
children: senior adult male 70+ yrs old; senior adult
female 70+ yrs old: pensioners
� Household 5 (HH5) (n = 4): adult male 31–50 year
old; adult female 31–50 year old; boy 14 years old;
girl 8 years old
Development of the current (unhealthy) diet basket
followed the INFORMAS optimal approach [7]. It con-
tains foods and quantities based on the results of the
dietary component of the Australian Health Survey
(AHS) 2011–12 which report major, sub-major and
minor food groups by age/gender groups (ABS: data
cubes 5.1 and 5.3) [3]. When the draft tool was devel-
oped in August 2014, confidential unit record files
(CURFs) from the survey had not been released, but it
was anticipated that application of the summary data
available publically could inform a relatively pragmatic
method to estimate current diets, suitable for broader
global application under INFORMAS [7]. The current
(unhealthy) diet basket is comprised of foods and drinks
in the quantities and proportions reported as con-
sumed, for example, with percentage energy from
discretionary
choices
as
reported
earlier
[3]
(See
Additional file 1: file 2.1).
Ideally, the specific foods included in both diet baskets
are culturally acceptable, commonly consumed, widely
available, accessible and considered ‘every day’ rather
than luxury items. As the foods and drinks included in
the current (‘unhealthy’) basket reflect actual consump-
tion data, it was presumed that they were deemed by the
population as a whole as meeting these requirements.
For the current (unhealthy) diet baskets, the mean
amounts of each food sub-group per fortnight were cal-
culated from reported daily intake for each relevant age/
gender group (ABS: Table 5.1 and Table 5.3) [3] and
tallied.
Development of the healthy (recommended) diet bas-
ket also followed the INFORMAS optimal approach [7]
based on the quantitative modelled Foundation Diet rec-
ommendations for each age/gender group of the Austra-
lian Guide to Healthy Eating which include modelled
serve sizes and recommended number of serves [4, 17].
The Foundation diet serve recommendations for house-
hold members are shown in Table 1. The products in
the healthy diet basket are analogous to the commonly
consumed healthy foods in the current diet, but differ in
quantity. The healthy diet basket for each household
contains the recommended quantities of foods from the

 five food groups and an allowance for unsaturated oils
and spreads, for composite age/gender groups of phys-
ical activity level (PAL) 1.4, but, consistent with Austra-
lian recommendations [4, 17],does not contain any
discretionary choices [4]. As the Foundation Diets were
developed for the smallest adults (or in the case of chil-
dren, the youngest) in each age/gender group, any ne-
cessary adjustments were made for height/age; for
example, amounts were adjusted by an additional 20 %
for the 8 year old girl who was the oldest in her group
[17]. Consistent with the modelling [17], the healthy diet
basket includes: grain (cereal) foods, in the ratio 2/3
wholegrain and 1/3 refined varieties; cheese, milk, yog-
hurt
and
calcium-fortified
plant
based
alternatives,
mostly (i.e., >50 %) reduced fat, with a maximum of 2–3
serves of high fat dairy foods (cheese) per week; lean
meat (beef, lamb, veal, pork), poultry and plant-based al-
ternatives (with no more than 455 g red meat per week);
a minimum of 140 g and up to 280 g fish per week;
around 7 eggs per week; a selection of different colours
and varieties of vegetables (green and brassica, orange,
legumes, starchy veg, other) with a minimum 350 g per
day for adults; a variety of fruit with a minimum of
300 g per day for adults; and an allowance of unsatur-
ated oils or spreads or the nuts/seeds from which they
are derived. (See Additional file 1: file 1.1).
For the healthy (recommended) diet baskets, the
amounts of each food sub-group (serve size multiplied
by recommended number of serves) per fortnight were
calculated from omnivore Foundation Diets [17] for each
of the specific age/gender groups included in the five
household structures and tallied. A variety of fresh,
canned, frozen and dried foods was included in the pro-
portions modelled [17] with representative fresh produce
being in season for most of the year (e.g., stone fruits in
season only in summer were excluded). Luxury products
such as imported fruit and vegetables (particularly out of
season) and foods with high cost per kilogram (e.g., oys-
ters, smoked salmon) were excluded.
The specific branding of items and product sizes for
pricing were not finalized until field testing confirmed
that these products were commonly available in pilot
stores (See Additional file 1: files 1.2 and 2.2).
Collection of food prices
One high socio-economic and one low socio-economic
Statistical Area Level 2 (SA2) [25] location within 30 km
of Brisbane General Post Office were randomly selected
as locations for field testing; these were Indooroopilly
(high SES) and Logan (low SES). In both locations,
stores of the national supermarket chains available in all
state and territories in Australia (Coles, Woolworths and
Independent Grocers Australia (IGA)) were included,
and the prices of food and drink items in both diet
baskets were collected in the second and third weeks of
September 2014, including commonly available brands,
sizes and ‘home-brand’ generic items, based on methods
previously used in Western Australia [14]. Common
‘fast-food’/take-away items (including a Big Mac ham-
burger from the McDonald’s™ chain, pizza from the
Pizza Hut™ chain and fish and chips from independent
outlets) and alcoholic beverages (spirits, wine and beer)
were priced in the respective take-away and liquor out-
lets closest to each supermarket in each location.
Data recorded included: usual price as well as the price
promotion or sale price; cheapest price for loose (not
packaged) fresh produce of that description (e.g., red ap-
ples); brand name, and whether the item is branded or
generic (‘home brand’); and prices of different available
sizes.
To finalise the diet baskets, the most commonly avail-
able branded items and unit sizes in all six supermarkets
were included. Some nutritionally similar products were
combined to minimize the number of items in each tool;
for example, processed meats such as salami and hot
dogs were combined with sausages (See Additional file
1: files 1.2 and 2.2).
No attempt was made to adjust the quantities in the
current (unhealthy) diet basket for under-reporting in
the AHS 2011–12 [3]. An allowance for edible portion/
as cooked was included in both diet baskets, but not for
any post-plate wastage in either basket (Additional file 1:
files 1.2 and 2.2).
Performance of draft tools and protocols
Convergent validity of the constructed healthy (recom-
mended) and current (unhealthy) diet baskets for each
age/gender group was assessed by energy and macronutri-
ent analysis using FoodWorks 7 Professional [26] com-
puter program installed with current Australian food
composition datasets, and comparing the results with
Australian Nutrient Reference Values [27] and nutrient re-
sults from the AHS 2011-12 [3] respectively. The food
composition database used to analyse the AHS (AUSNUT
2011–13) was not available publically at the time this
manuscript was prepared; comparative analysis could be
improved by repeating analysis when it is released publi-
cally. Price and affordability findings were compared with
previous available estimates to determine face validity.
Internal validity indicators, such as the ratio of fruit and
vegetables between diet baskets, were also assessed and
compared.
Diet prices and affordability
The price of the final ‘healthy’ (recommended) and
current (unhealthy) diet baskets was calculated for each
of the five household compositions in each store in each
location.
Lee et al. BMC Public Health  (2016) 16:315 
Page 5 of 22
 The potential price increases for all foods in the diet
baskets under the mooted changes to the Australian tax
system [20] were also determined by application of the
information available at the Australian Taxation Office
calculator site for businesses [21]. Changes in price were
compared to identify potential impacts on diet cost for
each household (See Additional file 1: files 1.3, 1.4, 1.5,
2.3, 2.4, 2.5).
Affordability
of
the
healthy
(recommended)
and
current (unhealthy) diet baskets for the average family
household was determined by comparing the cost of
each diet with the median disposable household income,
as per the INFORMAS optimal approach [7]. Median
disposable household income derived from recent census
data in both locations was transcribed from the Queens-
land Government Statistician’s Office website [28].
For the purposes of calculating the affordability of the
healthy (recommended) and current (unhealthy) diet
baskets for low income families, indicative minimum
disposable income of each household was calculated
based on the level of minimum wages and determination
of the welfare payments provided by the Department of
Human Services (2014) as per the methods used by the
Queensland Department of Health [16]. Based on the
Queensland Council of Social Services’ cost of living
research on theoretical low income households [29] as-
sumptions were made for employment, housing type,
disability status, savings and investments, child support,
education attendance and immunization status of chil-
dren [16]. Details are included in Table 2.
Data and statistical analysis
Results were analyzed by a range of metrics, including
the current cost of purchasing specific core five food
group and discretionary items (including policy relevant
items such as alcohol, ‘take-away foods’ and sugar-
sweetened beverages) and compared with the compo-
nent costs of healthy (recommended) diets.
Data were also entered into IBM SPSS statistics
Version 21 and Wilcoxen-signed ranks test used to com-
pare the costs of diets between high and low socioeco-
nomic (SES) areas and differences in the cost of diets
based on proposed policy changes to GST.
Results
The diet basket pricing tools
The daily nutrient analysis of the healthy (recom-
mended) and current (unhealthy) diets for each age/gen-
der group included in the five household structures is
presented in Table 3. The foods comprising the diet bas-
kets are presented in Table 4.
As deemed acceptable for modelling outputs to develop
the Australian Guide to Healthy Eating [17], the energy
content of the constructed healthy (recommended) diet
baskets was within 5 % of the Foundation Diet levels and
the macronutrient profiles were within the recommended
ranges for more than 97 % of values for all age/gender
groups [17]. Hence these tools appeared to be valid for
use in estimating the cost of healthy diets in this pilot.
The energy content of the current (unhealthy) diet baskets
was within 5 % of the reported energy intakes of the AHS
[3] for the adult male, adult female and the two youngest
children, but not for the 14 year old boy or seniors
(Table 3). However, at the household level, the mean en-
ergy content of the current (unhealthy) diet basket was
within 5 % of the reported intakes for all but HH4 (com-
prising the two seniors) (Table 4). However, as the price
findings (Table 5) were consistent with available house-
hold expenditure survey data [30] (discussed below) and
reflected the ratio of current and recommended intakes
for key food groups [3, 4], the current (unhealthy) diet
basket tools appeared to be valid for use in estimating the
cost of current diets in the majority of the households in
this pilot study. However results for HH4 should be ap-
plied with caution.
In this pilot study, the diet basket tools were devel-
oped when neither detailed confidential unit record data
(CURFS) from the AHS 2011-12 [3] nor the food com-
position database (AUSNUT 2011–13) used in the ana-
lysis of that survey, were available publically. Although
the draft tools appeared fit for purpose and performed
well at face value at household level, differences between
analysis of reported and constructed current diets at the
individual level suggest that more accurate and specific
current (unhealthy) diet basket tools may be able to be
produced for Australia by accessing and analysing the
AHS 2011–12 CURFS when available [3]. More broadly,
it is noted that this more precise approach may be too
complex for application globally, as detailed dietary sur-
vey data are not easily accessible in all countries and
technical capacity to analyse individual records may be
limited. Therefore the more pragmatic approach used in
this pilot study may be more feasible for INFORMAS to
monitor the price differential of healthy and current
(unhealthy) diets globally [7].
Diet prices
The price of the healthy (recommended) and current
(unhealthy) diet baskets for each of the five household
structures at the two locations is shown in Table 5. The
higher variance at the high SES location was mainly due
to the higher prices in the IGA store compared to the
two major supermarket chains in that area. On average,

2) Salaries calculated on national minimum wage at www.fairwork.gov.au $17.29/h, casual add 25 % loading to $21.61/h
3) Work status based on 2011 Census data for Queensland (couple households tend to have a fulltime working male and a part-time working female; or when the male is looking for work the female is typically also
out-of-work; for single-parent households, more females tend to work part-time until children are over 14 years)
4) Average rent varies by location (SA2): http://www.abs.gov.au/ausstats/abs@.nsf/Lookup/by%20Subject/4130.0~2013–14~Main%20Features~Housing%20Costs%20and%20Affordability~5 Estimated rent based on
average of median rates across Queensland postcodes for March 2014 quarter from the Rental Tenancy Authority

 drinks and sugar-sweetened beverages were priced
similarly in both locations (Table 5).
All five household structures spend more purchasing
current (unhealthy) diets than the amount required to
purchase healthy (recommended) diets (Table 5). At
both locations, a healthy diet cost 88–99 % of the money
currently being spent on food and drinks in households
containing children (HH1, HH2 and HH5). Relatively, a
healthy diet costs even less than the current (unhealthy)
diet in households without children; 84 % in the house-
hold of two elderly adults (HH4) and only 66 % in the
household consisting of a single male (HH3).
Only 10–15 % of the food dollar is currently being
spent on fruit and vegetables, compared to approxi-
mately 29 % required to achieve recommended intakes
of these important foods. Similarly, less than half of the
required amount is being spent on: grain (cereal) foods,
particularly wholegrains (6–8 % currently compared to

 11–18 % required); lean meats, poultry, fish, eggs and
plant-based alternatives (16–17 % currently compared to
30–33 % required); milk, cheese, yoghurt (4–6 % cur-
rently compared to 17–27 % required); and unsaturated
oils and spreads (<0.3 % currently compared to 1–2 %
required).
Worryingly, the majority of the food dollar is being
spent on discretionary choices at 53–64 % in both high
and low socio-economic locations (Table 5). Within this
category, 10–22 % of the total food dollar is spent on al-
coholic drinks; this proportion is lowest in households
containing children. If alcoholic drinks are excluded
from the current diet, the cost of the healthy (recom-
mended) diets is between 2–8 % more expensive than
the current diet for all households except that of the sin-
gle male (HH3). At 10–16 % of the current food dollar,
spending is also relatively high on take-away foods (such
as hamburgers and pizzas) and on sugar-sweetened bev-
erages (1.6-4 %); spending for both these items is highest
in families with children.
Testing the impact of policy change on diet prices
In one example of policy change tested, proposal to ex-
pand the base of the GST to include fresh healthy food
in Australia, the cost of the healthy (recommended) diet
basket would significantly increase by 9.9 % but the cost
of the current (unhealthy) diet basket would increase by
only 4.5 % to 5.5 % (Z = −4.78, P < 0.01) (Table 6). In real
terms, in order to purchase a healthy diet, on average
the various households would need to find additional
funds of: $80.15 for HH1; $41.86 for HH2; $14.52 for
HH3; $27.40 for HH4; and $56.39 for HH5, whereas the
additional cost of current (unhealthy) diets would in-
crease by less than 45 % of these amounts. Under this
scenario, healthy diets would become relatively more ex-
pensive than current (unhealthy) diets, and the discre-
tionary items in the current (unhealthy diet) would
become relatively more affordable also.
If the GST base remained the same but the rate of
GST was increased to 15 % or 20 % respectively, the
price of the healthy diet basket would be similar to
present, but the prices of the current (unhealthy) diet
basket would increase by around 2 % and 4–5 % respect-
ively, with the discretionary items in the current basket
increasing by about twice these rates. Under the latter
scenario, healthy diets would become relatively less ex-
pensive than current (unhealthy) diets.
Affordability
The median family income per fortnight in 2011 was
$4,342 in the high SES area and $2740 per fortnight in
the low SES area [28]. In the high SES area, the cost of
the healthy and current (unhealthy) diet baskets for the
average family household per fortnight is $610.56 (14 %
of median income) and $673.45 (15.5 % of median in-
come) respectively. In the low SES area, the cost of the
healthy and current (unhealthy) diet baskets for the aver-
age family household per fortnight is $590 [28] (21.5 %
of median income) and $651.65 (23.7 % of median in-
come) respectively.
The affordability of the diet baskets in low income
households is nearly half that of families of median in-
come (Table 6). Affordability of the healthy diet basket
as a proportion of household income ranges from
around 20 % for the low income household of two pen-
sioners (HH4) to around 30 % for the low income
household of six (HH1).
However, for these low income families, under the
mooted changes to expand the base of the GST to in-
clude basic healthy food in Australia, the affordability of
the healthy (recommended) diet would decrease by
around 4 %, but the affordability of their current (un-
healthy) diet would decrease by only around 2 %
(Table 6). However, if the GST exemption on basic
healthy foods was retained, but the rate on other
foods and goods and services was increased by 15 %
or 20 %,a healthy diet would be 7 % and 9 % respect-
ively more relatively affordable than an unhealthy diet
(Table 6); but the pressure on the food budget would
likely be increased due to the increased cost of other
essential items [29].
Discussion
Price and price differential of healthy (recommended) and
current (unhealthy) diets
This study aimed to pilot the development and testing of
draft tools, survey protocols, data collection and analysis
systems to investigate the price, relative price and afford-
ability of healthy (recommended) and current (un-
healthy) diets in Australia, as well as test the utility of
the approach to assess impacts of potential policy
changes on diet prices, in this case the proposed broad-
ening and/or raising of the GST base in Australia.
Findings suggest that healthy diets consistent with na-
tional dietary recommendations are less expensive than
current (unhealthy) diets consumed by the Australian
population; however lower income households are still
required to spend a high proportion of their disposable
income accessing healthy foods. As there is a common
perception that healthy foods are more expensive than
unhealthy foods [7, 31, 32] these results may be consid-
ered surprising. A systematic review that accounted for
key sources of heterogeneity, found little difference be-
tween the prices of healthier versus less healthy dietary
patterns, although the former tended to be slightly more
expensive [31]. The effect of the cost of alcoholic drinks
and pre-prepared ‘convenience’ foods do not appear to
have been considered in that review, which may help

 explain why our findings differ from these results as the
current (unhealthy) Australian diet includes a high pro-
portion of these items. Amongst other components of
the diet, depending on the unit reported (that is, per en-
ergy, weight or serving), the individual price of some
healthy foods, particularly meats and dairy foods and
vegetables, are relatively expensive compared with en-
ergy dense discretionary foods and are also more expen-
sive than core (healthy) cereal-based foods [31, 33].
The high proportion of the food dollar currently being
spent on discretionary choices in Australia is of particu-
lar concern. For example, a family of two adults and two
children (HH5) spends over 58 % of their food dollar on
discretionary choices, which provide around 38 % of
their total energy intake. A recent report on the Austra-
lian Dietary Guidelines food price indexes released by
the Australian Government [34] found that 58.2 % of
household’s food budget in 2014 was spent on discre-
tionary foods and drinks, confirming our findings.
Within the discretionary category, we found households
are spending around 14 % on alcoholic drinks, around
15 % on take-away foods and around 4 % on sugar-
sweetened beverages. This suggests that, while food
price is important, other factors such as convenience
and/or desirability and ‘taste’
, and the determinants of
these factors, such as the ubiquitous availability, ad-
vertising and marketing of discretionary choices, poor
food literacy and cooking skills and busy lifestyles
may be more important influences on food choice in
Australia [4].
Higher food prices were observed in the higher SES
area compared to the lower SES area consistent with
previous studies [35].
No attempt was made to control the price of the
healthy (recommended) diet baskets and the current
(unhealthy) diet baskets for energy, as the diets are con-
structed on recommended energy levels and actual re-
ported levels of energy respectively, and the energy
content of each is a determinant variable that directly af-
fects diet-related health outcomes [4, 7]. Further, as the
key exposure variable affecting the life time risk of diet-
related disease is the total diet and dietary patterns,
these findings illustrate that studies such as this pilot
that compare the cost of actual diets with recommended
diets are more pertinent to the health policy debate than
the more common, but limited, studies into the relative
price of selected ‘healthy’ and ‘unhealthy’ foods or single
‘optimised’ diets [7, 18, 19, 31].
Affordability of healthy (recommended) and current
(unhealthy) diets
Findings suggest that a healthy diet consistent with Aus-
tralian Dietary Guidelines [4] is presently affordable for
families on a median income costing approximately
18 % of disposable income, but is much less affordable
for low income families, costing around 28 % of their
household disposable income (Table 6). In comparison,
current (unhealthy) diets cost around 20 % of the in-
come of a family of median income and 32 % of the in-
come of low income families (Table 6).
These results are consistent with household expend-
iture survey data [30] which showed that 16.5 % of aver-
age equivalised disposable income was spent on food
and drink in all Queensland households, but at 21–41 %
of disposable income of low income households, are
higher than the equivalised proportion (19.5 %) reported
for these households in another study [29]. Disparities
are likely to be due to different methodologies, but
the amounts spent on food and drink per week in the
official reports [29, 30] (for example $79 per week for
an unemployed single person) are very low suggesting
very restricted diets, and do not concord with prices
of the mean quantities of food and drink reported in
the AHS [3].
Our findings are similar to those community studies
of the affordability of selected ‘healthier’ diets (i.e., not
necessarily consistent with dietary recommendations)
which cost between 28 % and 40 % of the disposable in-
come of lowest income families, compared with 20 % for
families on the average income [7] and up to 48 % of in-
come if environmental sustainability of the diet is also
considered [5]. In Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander
communities in Australia, depending on location, it has
been estimated that at least 34 %-80 % of the family in-
come is needed to purchase healthy diets [9, 36]. At least
3.7 % of Australian households report having run out of
food in the previous 12 months and not being able to af-
ford to buy more [3, 6]. This proportion is higher among
some groups, affecting more than one in in five Aborigi-
nal and Torres Strait Islanders (22 %) [37], around 11 %
of those unemployed and 16 % of rental households [6].
Internationally there is no accepted benchmark for af-
fordability of a healthy diet [7]. One of the proposed
equity targets to close the gap on Indigenous disadvan-
tage in Australia was that, by 2018, 90 % of Indigenous
families could access a healthy food basket for under
25 % of their disposable income [38]. A figure of 25 %
seems reasonable as a working estimate given the com-
peting priorities for other essential items in the house-
hold budget, such as housing, transport, health services,
clothing and utilities [29].
The fact that current (unhealthy) diets including alco-
holic drinks cost more than healthy diets in Australia,
may mask the fact that, at 28 % of income, healthy diets
are already unaffordable for low income families in
Australia, and reinforces the notion that, if we are not to
worsen diets and increase the prevalence of diet-related
chronic disease in Australia, price-elasticities must be
Lee et al. BMC Public Health  (2016) 16:315 
Page 18 of 22
 considered very carefully before food prices are changed
in Australia, as proposed under potential changes to the
Australian Tax System [20]. Quantitative modelling of
the impacts of such strategies requires an understanding
of own-price elasticities (how consumption changes with
an item’s own price) and cross-price elasticities (how
consumption of an item changes with changes in the
price of another good) in different groups [39, 40]. An
additional consideration for food price elasticities is
whether the cross-price elasticities are within the same
or different food groups [18]. Plausible food price elasti-
cities have been estimated for use in Australia and New
Zealand [40] and globally [41] and could be used to
model the consumption and consequent health impacts
of the changing prices estimated under various policy
scenarios in future studies.
The poor quality of the current Australian diet is con-
sistent with high risk of diet-related disease, especially
those mediated by obesity, including type 2 diabetes, car-
diovascular disease and some cancers [4] and represents
a significant threat to Australia’s health, economic and
broader social systems [1, 4]. Therefore it is critical that
no additional barriers, such as increased cost of healthy
foods, are put in the way of Australians choosing health-
ier foods and diets.
The findings suggest that more needs to be done to
promote healthy diets, including disseminating the fact
that they can be less expensive than current dietary pat-
terns. Healthy budgeting programs such as FOODcents
may be useful in this regard [42]. Affordability of healthy
foods among lower income groups could be improved
by promoting cheaper options that are still healthy, such
as local specials and seasonal or irregular shaped fresh
produce. It is also likely that barriers to healthy choices,
such as low food literacy and poor cooking skills, also
need to be addressed [4, 43]. However, there is mounting
evidence that current “food environments exploit peo-
ple’s biological, psychological, social and economic vul-
nerabilities, making it easier for them to eat unhealthy
foods” [44] and that “regulatory actions from govern-
ments and increased efforts from industry and civil soci-
ety will be necessary to break these vicious cycles” [44].
Testing impact of policy changes on diet prices: the effect
of potential changes to the Australian taxation system
Under potential changes to the Australian Tax System
[20], if the GST base was extended to encompass basic
healthy foods, the cost of healthy (recommended) diets
would increase (9.9 %) by more than double the rate of
current (unhealthy) diets (4.5 %), decreasing the relative
affordability of healthy foods. In real terms, a healthy
diet would cost a family of two adults and two children
an additional $56.39 per week. At 30 % of disposable
household income, this is likely to be unaffordable for
low income families. Under this scenario, it would be
less likely that the population would move towards
healthier eating patterns, as the healthy foods consumed
within the current diet would also increase significantly
in price compared with discretionary choices; hence it
would be likely that an even greater proportion of the
food dollar would be spent on discretionary choices
(‘junk food’).
If the GST is not extended to basic healthy foods but
is applied at higher rates (15 % and 20 %) to those foods
and drinks currently incurring GST, a healthy diet would
cost no more than presently, but the cost of the current
(unhealthy) diet would increase by more than $14.00
(2.2 %) and around $29.00 (4.5 %) per fortnight respect-
ively for a family of two adults and two children. As the
relative affordability of a healthy diet compared with the
current (unhealthy) diet would improve under these sce-
narios, these policy actions effectively work as a tax on
unhealthy food [19]. However the cost of non-food items
that currently attract GST at 10 % would also increase,
potentially leaving less money to be spent on food,
highlighting the regressive nature of GST which dispro-
portionally affects those on lower incomes [19]. Consid-
eration of available price elasticities in Australia [40] and
recent ‘real world’ data showing that a 20 % price reduc-
tion in fruit and vegetables increased household pur-
chases by 35 % for fruit and 15 % for vegetables [45]
suggests that the higher rate of GST would be most ef-
fective in helping drive dietary improvements. However,
as mentioned previously, careful consideration of factors
other than price that influence dietary choices would
also be required. In addition, a healthy diet would still
cost up to 28 % of the disposable income of low income
families and would be unaffordable for some groups.
The regressive nature of taxation on unhealthy foods is
potentially problematic but can be alleviated by targeted
subsidies to vulnerable groups to help alleviate pressure
on the household budget [7, 19]. Differential tax rates,
such as 30 % GST on sugar-sweetened beverages, may
also have merit [19].
Limitations
There are several methodological limitations in this
study, including that the cost of the current (unhealthy)
diet may not be the same as actual expenditure on food,
given that it is based on national mean dietary intakes.
Other assumptions include that food is shared equitably
throughout the households, that there is no home food
production and no wastage. Nutritionally similar prod-
ucts were aggregated to minimize the number of items
included in the food pricing basket tools but products
were not necessarily homogenous in terms of price;
similar food items were included in each basket to try to
minimize any unintended effects. No adjustments were
Lee et al. BMC Public Health  (2016) 16:315 
Page 19 of 22
 made for costs such as transport, time, cooking equipment
and utilities; as these apply to both the current and healthy
(recommended) diets, assessment of the price differential
between the two can control for some of these hidden costs
to some extent, but the effect of these would increase actual
diet costs and decrease affordability of the diets. No adjust-
ments were made to account for the marked under-
reporting in the AHS 2011–12 [3, 37], reported dietary vari-
ability amongst different groups other than age/gender
stratification, the greater proportion of pre-prepared ‘con-
venience’ items containing meats and/or vegetables the
current (unhealthy) diet tool, or, given the high rates of
overweight/obesity in Australia, that the Foundation diets
were prescribed for the shortest and least active in each age
group [17]. The study design presumes that price and
healthfulness are key drivers of dietary choice in families,
but as the results suggest, other needs such as taste and
convenience, may now play a greater role in food choice.
Arbitrary decision points occur around sampling frame-
works, data collection protocols, analysis and presentation
of results, data sources and definitions of family and
household income and composition. Such methodological
limitations are common to other food price studies, and
in order for final methods to be replicable, detailed publi-
cation of all assumptions and protocols, and the under-
lying rationale of the final methods is required.
Next steps
Our next step is to apply insights from this pilot study
to finalize the diet basket pricing tools. We are recon-
structing the composition of the current (unhealthy)
baskets using detailed unit record data (CURFS) from
the AHS 2011–12 [3], analyzing these with the AUS-
NUT 2011–13 food composition data base and docu-
menting key decision points in the survey protocols to
produce a detailed methods paper for the final tools.
Once the tools are finalized, a workshop with all stake-
holders will be held to build on previous understandings
and seek agreement for the use of these methods as a
standardized approach throughout Australia. Pending
funding, additional data will be collected in New South
Wales, the Australian Capital Territory, Queensland
and, ideally, nationally as part of the first INFORMAS
assessment of Australian food environments.
Resultant food price and affordability data will be used to
feed into broader computer modelling systems, for example,
to determine more robust estimates of projected health im-
pacts and costs under different fiscal policy scenarios.
Conclusion
This pilot study confirms that, to inform fiscal and
health policy actions and ensure equitable affordability
of healthy diets, standardized food price assessment,
monitoring and surveillance efforts should seek to
determine and compare the costs of current (unhealthy)
diets as well as healthy (recommended) diets. Our find-
ings suggest that the approach suggested in this paper is
a valid means of achieving this.
The results show that Australians are spending more on
current (unhealthy) diets than would be required to pur-
chase healthy diets consistent with the recommendations of
the Australian Dietary Guidelines. Using the methods to
test the price impacts of policy options, showed that pro-
posed extension to the GST base to include basic healthy
food would markedly increase the cost of a healthy diet
relative to current (unhealthy) diets, limiting the affordabil-
ity of healthy dietary patterns, particularly for lower income
households who are already most vulnerable to poor diet-
related health.
Findings also suggest that more needs to be done to
tackle assumptions that healthy diets are more expensive
than unhealthy diets. More research is required to better
understand the relative importance of factors affecting
food choice in Australia.
The study has demonstrated that meaningful food pri-
cing tools based on recent Australian dietary data (current
unhealthy diet) and recommendations (healthy diet) can
be drafted and applied readily. The draft tools appeared fit
for purpose and performed well at face value at household
level, but some improvements can and will be made. The
tools have the potential to be standardized nationally and
inform similar research in other countries.
