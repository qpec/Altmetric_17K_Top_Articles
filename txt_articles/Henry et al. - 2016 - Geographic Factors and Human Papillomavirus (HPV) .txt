Abstract
Background: This study is amongthe first toexplore geographic
factors that may be associated with human papillomavirus (HPV)
vaccine uptake in the United States.
Methods: Data from the 2011 and 2012 National Immuniza-
tion Survey-Teen for 20,565 female adolescents aged 13 to 17
years were analyzed to examine associations of HPV vaccine
initiation (receipt of at least one dose) with ZIP code–level
geographic factors. Logistic regression including individual and
geographic factors was used to estimate the odds of HPV vaccine
initiation.
Results: Approximately 53% of girls initiated the HPV vaccine
in both years. Girls in high poverty communities had higher HPV
vaccine initiation compared with those in low poverty commu-
nities [61.1% vs. 52.4%; adjusted OR (AOR), 1.18; 95% confi-
dence intervals (CI),1.04–1.33]. Initiation was higher amonggirls
in communities where the majority of the population was His-
panic (69.0% vs. 49.9%; AOR, 1.64; 95% CI, 1.43–1.87) or non-
Hispanic mixed race (60.4% vs. 49.9%; AOR, 1.30; 95% CI, 1.17–
1.44) compared with majority non-Hispanic white communities.
Interactions between individual-level race/ethnicity and commu-
nity racial–ethnic composition indicated significantly higher
odds of initiation among Hispanic girls living in Hispanic com-
munities compared with Hispanic girls living in predominantly
non-Hispanic White (NHW) (AOR, 2.23; 95% CI, 1.87–2.65) or
non-Hispanic Black (NHB) (AOR, 1.90; 95% CI, 1.20–3.04)
communities, respectively.
Conclusion: Initiation rates of HPV vaccination among teen
girls were highest in the poorest communities and among His-
panics living in communities where the racial–ethnic composi-
tion was predominantly Hispanic or mixed race.
Impact: Given low HPV vaccination rates in the United States,
these results provide important evidence to inform public health
interventions to increase HPV vaccination. Cancer Epidemiol Biomar-

Introduction
The human papillomavirus (HPV) represents the most com-
mon sexually transmitted infection in the United States (1). HPV
infection is associated with cancers in women, including cervical,
vulvar, anal, oropharyngeal, and vaginal (2, 3). In the United
States, approximately 20,589 HPV-associated cancers are diag-
nosed each year among females, many of which may be prevent-
able with the current HPV vaccine (2, 4). Cervical cancer is the
most common HPV-associated cancer found in women, account-
ing for about 55.5% (2).
Racial/ethnic and socioeconomic disparities in HPV-associated
cancers have been documented in the United States (5–7). His-
panic women have higher rates of cervical cancer compared with
non-Hispanic women. White and Black women had higher rates
of oropharyngeal cancer compared with women of other races,
and rates of vulvar and anal cancers were higher for Whites and
non-Hispanics than they were for other racial/ethnic groups. Rates
of vaginal cancer were highest among Blacks (3). Furthermore, in
the United States, incidence rates of each HPV-associated cancer
were highest among women living in neighborhoods where 20%
or more of the population is living below the poverty line
compared with women living in neighborhoods where <5% of
the population is living below poverty line (8).
Since 2006, The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention
(CDC) Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices (ACIP)
has recommended the safe and effective HPV vaccine for girls aged
11 or 12 years, and for females aged 13 through 26 years not
previously vaccinated (9). ACIP expanded its recommendation in
2011 to include boys. Receipt of the vaccine at ages 11 and 12
builds an effective immune response before the onset of sexual
activity (10, 11). Despite ACIP recommendations, HPV vaccina-
tion rates in the United States remain low. The Healthy People's
2020 goal for completing the recommended HPV vaccine three-
dose series is 80% for girls (12); yet in 2013, only 57.3% (�1.9) of
U.S. teen girls had received at least one dose of HPV vaccine, and
only 37.6% (�2.0) had three or more doses of the vaccine.
To date, most HPV vaccination studies have examined indi-
vidual- and provider-based factors as possible explanations for
the low vaccination rates (13). These studies found that higher
rates of HPV vaccine initiation were associated with older age,
health insurance type, urban residence, physician recommenda-
tion for the vaccine, receipt of other childhood vaccines, provider

 reminders, and knowledge of HPV (13). The most recent data
from the National Immunization Survey-Teen (NIS-Teen)
indicate that girls whose families live below the poverty line
had higher rates of both HPV vaccine initiation and receipt of
the three-dose series compared with girls whose families live
above the poverty line (14). Survey data also indicate that non-
Hispanic (NH) Whites and Asians had lower rates of HPV
vaccine initiation and receipt of the three-dose series compared
with Hispanics, NH Blacks, and American Indian/Alaska
Native (3).
In addition to provider- and individual-level factors, it is also
possible that geographic or neighborhood factors, like area-based
socioeconomic status (SES), could independently influence vac-
cination uptake. In other areas of cancer prevention research,
geographic factors such as area-based SES, racial–ethnic compo-
sition, and rural versus urban residence have been shown to
influence health status (e.g., cancer stage at diagnosis; refs. 15,
16) and health behaviors (e.g., up-to-date on mammogram)
independent of an individual's SES or other individual factors
such as health insurance (17–19). Similarly, area-based SES and
geographic factors could influence vaccination uptake through
pathways linked to the material resources of the neighborhood,
availability and ease of access to healthcare facilities, and social
capital or networks (e.g., social contagion, similar norms of
behavior; refs. 20–22).
Numerous possible outcomes related to HPV vaccination
uptake exist, given the different ways geographic factors can
influence health service utilization. For example, economic bur-
dens and barriers to care among lower income ethnic minority or
rural communities could result in lower HPV vaccination initia-
tion because of fewer health resources and limited financial
resources (23–25). Similarly, language barriers (13) and a lack
of awareness in ethnic minority communities (26–28) could
result in lower uptake (29). In contrast, HPVvaccination initiation
could be higher among lower income ethnic minority commu-
nities due to social support networks and resource availability
associated with living among co-ethnics or with certain groups in
segregated communities, similar cultural norms related to vacci-
nation and other health behaviors, or in part to long-term targeted
interventions or safety-net services, which provide free or subsi-
dized vaccines (30, 31).
To date, no studies in the United States have examined the
potential influence of the racial–ethnic composition of a com-
munity on HPV vaccination, and the three U.S. studies that
examined the influence of area-based SES were inconsistent
(32–34). Furthermore, these studies (32, 34) were limited to
specific states or populations (33). To advance research in this
area, investigators must explore area-based SES and other relevant
geographic factors including the community racial–ethnic com-
position that could impact HPV vaccination rates using national
data representing a wide variety of demographic and economic
groups.
In this study, we analyzed data from the NIS-Teen to examine
associations between HPV vaccine initiation among female
adolescents and community-level factors including area-based
poverty, rural/urban residence, and residential racial–ethnic
composition. To our knowledge, this is the first study exam-
ining associations between geographic factors and HPV vaccine
initiation among a nationally representative sample of teen
girls in the United States while also accounting for individual-
level characteristics.
Materials and Methods
Study data
All individual data were obtained from the restricted-use data
files of the 2011 and 2012 NIS-Teen, an annual survey conducted
by the CDC to monitor vaccination uptake in the United States.
The NIS-Teen includes a nationally representative stratified sam-
ple of girls and boys aged 13 to 17 years in all 50 states and the
District of Columbia. The survey is based on random-digit dialing
of both landline and cellular telephone numbers to identify
eligible households. It includes two parts: a survey of parents or
guardians of teens 13 to 17 years old to collect information about
demographic and socioeconomic characteristics, and a survey
mailed to all vaccination providers whom the parents identified
and consented to verify their teen's immunization histories. The
survey sampling procedures have been described elsewhere (35).
Study participants
The 2011 and 2012 NIS-Teen included 18,573 and 15,137 girls
aged 13 to 17 years, respectively, with completed surveys in the
United States. Of the total 33,710 girls for 2011 and 2012, 20,565
(61%) had provider-verified vaccination records. The present study
was limited to the girls with provider-verified vaccination records
and complete records for all the variables included in the analysis.
Individual-level measures
We examined HPV vaccine initiation (receipt of at least one
dose of the HPV vaccine, either quadrivalent or bivalent) as the
primary outcome variable. The outcome measure was dichoto-
mized as zero doses or one or more doses of the HPV vaccine. We
studied several individual-level variables from the survey: (i) the
teen's current age in years; (ii) race/ethnicity [non-Hispanic (NH)
White, NH Black, NH Other, and Hispanic]; (iii) health insurance
type (employer or union, Medicaid, or the State Children's Health
Insurance, military or Indian Health Service, and no insurance);
(iv) poverty status [categorized as above poverty, high income
(annual income > $75,000); above poverty, moderate income
(annual income � $75,000), below poverty, based on the U.S.
Census family poverty thresholds; ref. 36; and unknown]; (v)
receipt of a provider recommendation for HPV vaccination (yes,
no, or don't know); (vi) mother's age (�34 years, 35–44, or �45);
(vii) marital status (currently married or not currently married);
and (viii) education level (<12 years; 12 years with high school
diploma or general equivalency diploma; >12 years without
college degree; or college degree or higher). We also included
one healthcare system-level factor: facility type where vaccines
were administered.
Community-level measures
Using the ZIP codes of participants' current residences, several
geographic measures based on U.S. census ZIP Code Tabulation
Areas (ZCTAs) were merged with the NIS-Teen at the CDC
Research Data Center (RDC). The ZCTAs are generalized areal
representations of U.S. Postal Service areas, and in most instances,
the ZCTA is the same as the ZIP code (37). Ninety-eight percent of
the ZCTAs matched residential ZIP codes from the NIS-Teen
participants included in this study.
We developed geographic factors using measures of commu-
nity disadvantage previously included in health disparities
research (38, 39) and research on vaccination uptake and use of
cancer screening services (16, 33, 34, 40–42). Using the 2008–
2012 U.S. Census American Community Survey, we developed

 the following community-level geographic factors: (i) percentage
of a ZCTA's residents living below the federal poverty level (36);
(ii) median household income of ZCTA; (iii) population density,
and (iv) the racial–ethnic residential composition of the ZCTA.
These variables were each divided into quartiles based on the
distribution of these measures across ZCTAs. Percent living below
poverty was categorized into (i) <5%, (ii) 5%–< 10%, (iii) 10%–<
20%, and (iv) �20%.
We operationalized the measure of racial-ethnic residential
segregation using census data on racial–ethnic composition
because of our focus on the majority racial/ethnic group in each
ZIP code (43, 44). Numerous studies have shown that persistent
residential racial/ethnic segregation in the United States serves as
both a health promoter by facilitating stronger social support
networks and as a health barrier by fostering conditions that limit
resources (16, 39, 45, 46).Racial–ethnic composition in this study
was based on ZCTAs having >50% Hispanic, >50% NHW, >50%
NH Asian-Pacific Islander (NHAPI), >50% NHB, >50% NH
American Indian/Native Alaskan, or mixed (NHM), if not any
of the previous. Because of small numbers after merging the
racial–ethnic composition variables with the NIS-Teen, we com-
bined NH American Indian/Native Alaskan with NHAPI into a
category called NH-other.
We also included ZCTA measures of rural and urban residence
based on the rural-urban commuting area codes (RUCA; ref. 47).
The RUCAs provided a definition of rural/urban residences based
on criteria that included population density and population
work-commuting patterns. We categorized this variable as urban,
large rural city/town, small rural town, and isolated small rural
town (47).
Statistical analysis
For analysis, we combined the NIS-Teen datasets for 2011 and
2012, using suggested methods (35), and included appropriate
sampling weights for calculating the weighted percentages and
effect estimates (48). We used weighted frequencies and 95%
confidence intervals (CI) to describe the characteristics of the
sample. We performed bivariate association tests between HPV
vaccination initiation (receipt of one HPV vaccine dose) and
individual-level and community-based geographic variables with
Wald c2 tests.
The study used bivariate logistic regression models to estimate
the crude ORs and 95% CIs of vaccination series initiation for each
of the individual-level and geographic variables. Multivariable
logistic regression models were used to calculate the adjusted
odds ratios (AOR) and 95% CIs of vaccination initiation. One
multivariable model included only individual and provider fac-
tors, and two separate multivariable models were run to examine
the independent associations of ZIP code level poverty and racial–
ethnic composition with vaccination outcomes. Joint contribu-
tions of individual poverty and area poverty and racial segregation
were assessed with interaction terms between individual-level
race/ethnicity and ZIP code-level poverty and racial–ethnic com-
position. The surveyed state was included as a random effect to
account for dependency by state residence (e.g., state health
programs that will influence the girls from that state).
Bivariate associations were analyzed using procedures for com-
plex survey data in SAS statistical software (i.e., PROC SURVEY-
FREQ; ref. 49). Logistic regression analyses were conducted using
SAS GLIMMIX, which implements the Generalized Linear Mixed
Model and allows for the incorporation of stratum-specific
weighted analysis (50). Statistical tests were two-tailed with a
critical a of .05.
Results
Sociodemographic and geographic characteristics of the study
population are presented in Table 1. Sixty percent, or 20,565, of
girls in the age range of 13 to 17 years had adequate provider data
in the 2011 and 2012 NIS-Teen and were included in the study.
Overall, 53.5% of girls received more than one dose of HPV
vaccine; the proportion was slightly lower in 2011 (53.2%) than
in 2012 (53.8%). Most girls were NHW (55.3%) living in urban
communities (88.6%) with population densities greater than
651 persons per square mile (quartile 4; 59.5%), and in predom-
inantly NHW (69.5%) ZIP codes. Most mothers were >35 years
old (89.3%), without a college degree (33.8%) and had
employer- or union-provided health insurance (46.3%).
Table 2 shows the bivariate (unadjusted) ORs and AORs from
the multivariable logistic regression models. In the bivariate
analysis, all variables were statistically significantly associated
with HPV vaccine initiation. Girls living in high density, high
poverty, or urban communities had higher odds of vaccine
initiation than girls living in low density, low poverty, or rural
communities, respectively. Girls living in predominantly minor-
ity communities also had higher odds of vaccine initiation com-
pared with those in predominantly NHW communities, regard-
less of race/ethnicity.
In multivariable analyses that included only individual and
provider factors (Table 2, Model 1), all variables associated with
vaccine initiation from the bivariate analysis remained statisti-
cally significant (P � .05). Findings were consistent after adjusting
for ZIP code poverty and population density (Model 2), except
for the individual NHB race/ethnicity, which was no longer
significant.
Girls with health insurance through Medicaid or SCHIP had
higher odds of HPV vaccine initiation than those with employer-
or union-provided insurance (Model 1, AOR, 1.35; 95% CI, 1.24–
1.48). Among girls who received a provider recommendation to
vaccinate, the odds of vaccination initiation were 3.73 times
greater than in girls without such a recommendation. Higher
odds of vaccine initiation were also associated with girls whose
mothers had <12 years of education compared with those with a
college degree (Model 1, AOR, 1.73; 95% CI, 1.53–1.95); among
girls with mothers younger than 35 years old compared with girls
with mothers 45 years and older (Model 1, AOR, 1.45; 95% CI,
1.29–1.62); and amonggirls from households with income below
the poverty threshold compared to households above the poverty
threshold (Model 1, AOR, 1.24; 95% CI, 1.10–1.39).
On the basis of Model 2 results, which included individual
and provider factors and ZIP code-level poverty and population
density, girls living in communities with the highest poverty
levels had higher odds of HPV vaccination initiation compared
with girls living in communities with the lowest poverty levels
(Model 2, AOR, 1.18; 95% CI, 1.04–1.33). Girls living in
communities with the highest population density had higher
odds of HPV vaccination initiation compared with girls from
the lowest population density categories (Model 2, AOR, 1.49;
95% CI, 1.24–1.80).
Model 3 included individual factors and ZIP code-level racial–
ethnic composition and population density. The odds of HPV
vaccine initiation was higher among girls from communities

vaccine initiation compared with Hispanics living in lower pov-
erty ZIP codes (poverty 0%–9.9%; AOR, 1.39; 95% CI, 1.16–
1.65). A similar association was found for NH other/multiple
races living in high poverty versus low poverty ZIP codes (AOR,
1.43; 95% CI, 1.16–1.76). No other race/ethnicity and ZIP code
poverty groups were significant.
Figure 1 shows the model-adjusted percent of girls vaccinated
based on race/ethnicity and ZIP code racial–ethnic composi-
tion. Initiation rates were lowest for NHW and NHB and
highest for Hispanics regardless of the community's racial–
ethnic composition. The odds of initiation among Hispanic
girls living in Hispanic communities were 2.23 (95% CI, 1.87–
2.65) and 1.90 (95% CI, 1.20–3.04) times higher than for those
living in predominantly NHW or NHB communities, respec-
tively (results not shown).
Discussion
This study examined the relationship between HPV vaccine
initiation and individual- and community-level geographic fac-
tors among teen girls in the United States. Overall the odds of
initiation were highest among older girls, girls with SCHIP or
Medicaid health insurance, girls with younger mothers, and those
whose mothers had lower levels of education and incomes below
the federal poverty level. Receipt of a provider recommendation
was one of the factors most strongly associated with HPV vacci-
nation initiation. These findings are consistent with previous
studies that examined survey data (33, 34, 51–53). Also consistent
with recent reports (54, 55), we found that the rates of HPV
vaccination initiation were highest for Hispanic girls compared
with NHW, NHB and other NH race groups. We also found that
geographic factors including area-based poverty, residential
racial–ethnic composition, and population density were signifi-
cantly associated with HPV vaccination initiation even after
adjusting for individual-level factors.
Our findings indicating higher HPV vaccination initiation
among girls living in the poorest communities may seem contrary
to conventional beliefs that socioeconomic disadvantage may
result in barriers to care and underutilization of health services.
However, it is also plausible that the availability of safety-net
immunization services for these populations and their access to
HPV vaccines through the Vaccine for Children (VFC) program,
which is a federally funded program providing free recommended
vaccines to eligible children, may be contributing to the higher
HPV vaccine uptake (56, 57). Independent of race/ethnicity, the
lower HPV vaccine uptake in less disadvantaged or affluent
communities could be attributable to barriers related to out-of-
pocket expenses for girls who are underinsured, a lack of physician
recommendation, and/or infrequent preventive medicine visits.
Furthermore, parents in less disadvantaged or affluent commu-
nities may be less supportive of the HPV vaccine (58). Future
research should consider changes in HPV vaccine initiation in
these communities resulting from The Affordable Care Act (ACA),
which offers opportunities to improve HPV vaccination coverage
among teens. Presently, the ACA requires health insurers to cover
the costs of all ACIP-recommended vaccinations at no cost to
consumers when provided by in-network providers (59).
Our findings related to community-level poverty were similar
to those of one of three previous studies examining area-based SES
and HPV vaccination. Pruitt and colleagues (33) reported that
girls in poorer counties in six U.S. states were more likely to initiate
the vaccine than girls in wealthier counties. In contrast, Chao and
colleagues (32) used data from a managed care organization in
California and found that girls from high-income neighborhoods
were more likely to initiate the vaccine than girls from low-income
neighborhoods. The difference in the findings might result from
Chao's inclusion of girls within a different age range (9–17) and
only those who were members of the managed care organization,
therefore not including underinsured and/or unemployed popu-
lations, who might have different vaccination rates (32). Our
findings were also different from those of Tsui and colleagues'
study that included adolescent girls from Los Angeles County.
They found that neighborhood factors, including poverty, were
not independently associated with vaccine initiation after adjust-
ing for individual factors (34). The lack of a significant association
in Tsui's study may be related to the unique, small, and homo-
geneous sample (n ¼ 479) of immigrant, low-income mothers of
adolescent girls in the study.

tial racial-ethnic segregation and HPV vaccination initiation

 suggest that geographic factors play an important role in HPV
vaccinations beyond individual-level characteristics. We found
that girls from geographic communities with a majority Hispanic,
Black, or mixed-race population had significantly higher odds of
vaccination initiation than those from majority NHW commu-
nities. Residential racial-ethnic segregation in the United States
has been shown both to negatively influence health outcomes
through social isolation and lack of access to health and preven-
tative services (60–62) and to positively affect health through
strong social support networks and the availability of more
health-promoting resources (43, 63, 64). Racial-ethnic minorities
are more likely to live in poorer, inner-city urban areas than are
NHWs (16, 65) for reasons including racial discrimination, insti-
tutional racism, and immigrant settlement patterns (16, 65). In
our study, among the girls living in majority Hispanic or NHB
communities, 72% and 74% of them, respectively, lived in
communities where �20% of the population was below the
poverty line. In contrast, among the girls living in majority NHW
or mixed race/ethnicity communities, only 13% and 35% of
them, respectively, lived in similarly impoverished communities.
The higher HPV vaccination rates in poor communities with a
high concentration of racial-ethnic minorities could therefore be a
result of healthcare practice and community-based interventions
(e.g., educating key stakeholders influential to the adolescents'
vaccination behaviors) and other intervention strategies (66–70)
in support of HPV vaccination that have focused efforts on poor
Hispanic and Black communities where rates of cervical cancer
rates are highest (6).
Our findings also indicated that Hispanic girls living in pre-
dominantly Hispanic or mixed race/ethnicity communities
had HPV vaccination initiation rates significantly higher than
Hispanics living in predominantly NHW or NHB communities.
This result could be due to positive or protective factors related
to living in communities with a high concentration of ethnic
minorities sharing the same health-related values, who provide
critical social and instrumental support, and are targeted for
public health safety-net services and interventions, (71). These
findings are consistent with those of previous studies showing
residential racial–ethnic composition can influence health beha-
viors (43, 45). Higher HPV vaccination initiation rates among
Hispanics living in predominantly Hispanic communities could
also be a result of low levels of acculturation. Although we did not
directly measure acculturation in this study, Hispanic residential
segregation in the United States has been shown to be correlated
with lower levels of acculturation and low SES (44, 72–74); and,
there is evidence from past studies that Hispanics with lower levels
of acculturation are more supportive of vaccination for their
children than are other demographic groups (75, 76).
For NHB girls, the community's racial–ethnic composition did
not substantially change the HPV vaccination initiation rates.
Why this study does not show the same protective effect among
NHB girls living in poor, predominantly NHB communities as it
does for Hispanics girls living in predominantly Hispanic com-
munities is not known; however, it could be related to ease of
accessing safety-net services and/or less effective intervention
programs. Additional research is needed to better understand
why these differences exist and to further understand the inde-
pendent and/or joint contributions of race, segregation, and
poverty on the uptake of HPV vaccination.
Our findings are subject to several limitations. First, the
household response rates for 2011 and 2012 were 57.2% and
55.1%, respectively, and the cell phone response rates for the
same years were 22.4% and 23.3%, respectively. Although
sampling weights are designed to minimize nonresponse and
noncoverage bias, some bias remains in the weighted estimates
used for analysis. Second, the parents' role in the survey is
subject to recall bias. Some parents may have incorrectly
recalled whether they had ever received a provider recommen-
dation for the HPV vaccine. Third, the NIS-Teen did not collect
certain data potentially important to HPV vaccine initiation,
including the parents' health beliefs and uptake of other child-
hood immunizations. Finally, community geographic mea-
sures were based on ZCTA data because these were the smallest
geographic units available via NIS-Teen. ZCTA measures have
been shown to be more heterogeneous than other preferred
geographic units like census tracts and blocks (77). A change in
geographic unit (ZIP code to census tract) may result in dif-
ferent conclusions than those that are based on another unit of
analysis (often called the modifiable unit problem).
In conclusion, this study found that initiation rates of HPV
vaccination among teen girls were highest in the poorest com-
munities and among Hispanics living in communities where the
racial–ethnic composition was predominantly Hispanic or mixed
race. It also found that regardless of individual race/ethnicity, girls
living in predominantly NHW and NHB communities had the
lowest initiation rates. The reasons are unknown, but if public
health officials wish to increase vaccination coverage in girls in
these communities, they should obtain a better understanding of
the individual characteristics and geographic or contextual factors
that may lead to barriers to HPV vaccination and ineffective public
health interventions.
