IMPORTANCE Some patients with myasthenia gravis (MG) do not respond to conventional
treatment and have severe or life-threatening symptoms. Alternate and emerging therapies
have not yet proved consistently or durably effective. Autologous hematopoietic stem cell
transplant (HSCT) has been effective in treating other severe autoimmune neurologic
conditions and may have similar application in MG.
OBJECTIVE To report 7 cases of severe MG treated with autologous HSCT in which consistent,
durable, symptom-free, and treatment-free remission was achieved.
DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS This retrospective cohort study reports outcomes at
The Ottawa Hospital, a large, Canadian, tertiary care referral center with expertise in
neurology and HSCT, from January 1, 2001, through December 31, 2014, with a median
follow-up of 40 months (range, 29-149 months). Data collection and analysis were performed
from February 1 through August 31, 2015. All patients with MG treated with autologous HSCT
at The Ottawa Hospital were included. All had persistent severe or life-threatening
MG-related symptoms despite continued use of intensive immunosuppressive therapies.
INTERVENTIONS Autologous hematopoietic stem cell grafts were mobilized with
cyclophosphamide and granulocyte colony-stimulating factor, collected by peripheral blood
leukapheresis, and purified away from contaminating lymphocytes using CD34
immunomagnetic selection. Patients were treated with intensive conditioning chemotherapy
regimens to destroy the autoreactive immune system followed by graft reinfusion for blood
and immune reconstitution.
MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES The primary outcome was MG disease activity after
autologous HSCT measured by frequency of emergency department visits and
hospitalizations and Myasthenia Gravis Foundation of America (MGFA) clinical classification,
MGFA therapy status, and MGFA postintervention status. Safety outcomes included all severe
autologous HSCT–related complications.
RESULTS Seven patients underwent autologous HSCT, 6 for MG and 1 for follicular lymphoma
with coincident active MG. Mean (SD) ages at MG diagnosis and at autologous HSCT were 37
(11) and 44 (10) years, respectively. Five patients (71%) had concurrent autoimmune or
lymphoproliferative illnesses related to immune dysregulation. All patients had distinct
clinical and electromyographic evidence of MG (MGFA clinical classification IIIb-V). All
patients achieved durable MGFA complete stable remission with no residual MG symptoms
and freedom from any ongoing MG therapy (MGFA postintervention status of complete
stable remission). Three patients (43%) experienced transient viral reactivations, and 1 (14%)
developed a secondary autoimmune disease after autologous HSCT, all of which resolved or
stabilized with treatment. There were no treatment- or MG-related deaths.
CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE Autologous HSCT results in long-term symptom- and
treatment-free remission in patients with severe MG. The application of autologous HSCT for
this and other autoimmune neurologic conditions warrants prospective study.

M
yasthenia gravis (MG) is an antibody-mediated dis-
ease that affects the neuromuscular junction.
Despite advances in immune-targeted therapies, a
subset of patients have refractory disease with severe or life-
threatening symptoms.1 Autologous hematopoietic stem cell
transplant (HSCT) has been used to treat a variety of autoim-
mune neurologic conditions, including multiple sclerosis,
chronic inflammatory demyelinating polyneuropathy, neuro-
myelitis optica, stiff person syndrome, and others.2-5 We
report our center’
s experience using autologous HSCT for
7 patients with severe MG.
Methods
Cases were identified retrospectively from The Ottawa Hospi-
tal Bone Marrow Transplant Programme Database. All patients
withMGwhounderwentautologousHSCTfromJanuary1,2001,
through December 31, 2014, were included in the study. Data
collectionandanalysiswereperformedfromFebruary1through
August 31, 2015. Myasthenia gravis was diagnosed by clinical
assessment,electromyography,andautoantibodytesting.Ace-
tylcholine receptor (AChR) antibody testing was performed by
radioimmunoassay analysis at the Hamilton Regional Labora-
toryMedicineProgram,withareferencerangeoflessthan0.20
nmol/L. The primary outcome assessed was MG disease activ-
ity after autologous HSCT measured by (1) frequency of emer-
gency department visits and hospitalizations and (2) Myasthe-
niaGravisFoundationofAmerica(MGFA)clinicalclassification,
therapy status, and postintervention status.6 Safety outcomes
included all autologous HSCT–related complications of grade 3
or greater, defined by the Common Terminology Criteria for
Adverse Events (CTCAE).7 For clarity and conciseness, mild or
moderate autologous HSCT complications were not tabulated.
The Ottawa Hospital Research Ethics Board reviewed and ap-
proved this project, including assembly of deidentified data for
description and analysis.
Results
MG Activity Before Autologous HSCT
Seven patients underwent autologous HSCT from January 1,
2001, through December 31, 2014. Mean (SD) ages at MG
diagnosis and at autologous HSCT were 37 (11) and 44 (10)
years, respectively. Six patients underwent autologous
HSCT for MG, and 1 patient underwent autologous HSCT for
follicular lymphoma with coincident active MG (Table 1).
Five patients (71%) had concurrent autoimmune or lympho-
proliferative illnesses related to immune dysregulation. All
patients had distinct clinical and electromyographic evi-
dence of MG. The patients’ serologic status is given in
Table 1. Although muscle-specific kinase antibody testing is
now requested at diagnosis for AChR antibody–seronegative
patients at our institution, this test was not performed on
the 2 seronegative patients in this cohort because the test
was not readily accessible in Canada at the time of their
diagnosis. Before autologous HSCT, MG severity was graded
as moderate (grade III) to life-threatening (grade V) by
MGFA clinical classification6 and was refractory to treat-
ment regimens that included pyridostigmine, corticoste-
roids, additional immunomodulators, and plasma exchange
or intravenous immunoglobulin (Table 1). Of the 4 patients
who underwent thymectomy, none had a thymoma. Six
patients (86%) had at least 1 MG-related emergency depart-
ment visit or hospitalization before autologous HSCT
(Figure). Three patients (43%) required intensive care unit
(ICU) admission, and 2 patients (29%) required intubation at
least once.
Autologous HSCT
The details of autologous HSCT are summarized in Table 2
and the eTable in the Supplement. All patients underwent
stem cell mobilization with cyclophosphamide and granulo-
cyte colony-stimulating factor. Stem cell grafts were har-
vested by peripheral blood leukapheresis and purified by
positive selection of hematopoietic stem cells using an
immunomagnetic anti-CD34 monoclonal antibody
(CliniMACS CD34 Reagent System, Miltenyi Biotec Inc).
Intensive conditioning regimens were used to achieve
immune ablation before stem cell graft infusion. The first 2
patients received a conditioning regimen adapted from
HSCT for aplastic anemia, an autoimmune hematologic ill-
ness. Patients 3 to 6 received a regimen that has been used
for autologous HSCT of patients with multiple sclerosis.8
The patient with MG secondary to follicular lymphoma
received a conditioning regimen used for the treatment of
lymphoma.
MG Activity After Autologous HSCT
Median follow-up was 40 months (range, 29-149 months)
after autologous HSCT. At last follow-up, all patients were
classified as being in complete stable remission (CSR) by
MGFA criteria,6 indicating the absence of MG symptoms
without needing MG-directed therapy (Table 1). At 8 months
after autologous HSCT, all patients had discontinued immu-
nosuppressive therapies. Six patients (86%) had discontin-
ued MG therapy altogether, whereas 1 continued low-dose
Key Points
Question Is immune system ablation with high-dose
chemotherapy followed by autologous hematopoietic stem cell
transplantation effective treatment for patients with severe
myasthenia gravis?
Findings In this study of 7 patients with a severe myasthenia
gravis that persisted despite multiple immunosuppressive
treatments all patients achieved complete, durable, symptom- and
treatment-free remission after high-dose chemotherapy,
antithymocyte globulin, and CD34-selected autologous
hematopoietic stem cell transplantation.
Meanings Autologous hematopoietic stem cell transplantation
can be considered for select patients at experienced institutions
with severe myasthenia gravis for whom the risks of this
procedure are outweighed by its potential benefits.

pyridostigmine therapy for 5 years (Figure). Six patients
(86%) had no further hospitalizations or emergency depart-
ment visits. One patient required ICU admissions during the
first 18 months after autologous HSCT for airway sequelae
from prior repeated intubations. This patient has not been
hospitalized for MG for more than 11 years (Figure).
Early and Late Complications
After Autologous HSCT
Patients were hospitalized for a median of 30 days (range,
13-43 days) (Table 2). Acute complications were transient
and included CTCAE grade 3 mucositis in 2 patients (29%)
and febrile neutropenia in 3 patients (43%) (Table 2). Abso-
lute neutrophil count exceeded 500/μL (to convert to
×109/L, multiply by 0.001) a median of 11 days after autolo-
gous HSCT. No patient was admitted to the ICU for
treatment-related toxic effects, and there were no regimen-
related deaths. In the 2 months after autologous HSCT, viral
reactivation occurred in 3 patients (43%) (Table 2). All reac-
tivation resolved with antiviral treatment. One patient
developed acquired amegakaryocytic thrombocytopenia 2
years after autologous HSCT. In 1 patient with coincident
MG and lymphoma, lymphoma recurred and progressed 12
months after autologous HSCT and led to death 17 months
later. In this patient, MG achieved CSR after autologous
HSCT and remained so at the time of death.

Discussion
We describe 7 patients with severe MG in whom autologous
HSCT was followed by prolonged and complete symptom- and
treatment-free remission. An immunoablative conditioning
regimen that consisted of high-dose chemotherapy with or
without total-body irradiation and antilymphocyte antibod-
ies was administered to eliminate the established autoreac-
tive immune system. The bone marrow and immune system
were reconstituted by infusion of a previously harvested au-
tologous stem cell graft depleted of residual mature immune
cells by CD34 immunomagnetic selection. This treatment aims
towhollyreplaceanautoreactiveimmunesystemwithonethat
is protective and self-tolerant.
Compared with other MG treatments, autologous HSCT re-
quires hospital admission. The conditioning regimen and the
brief but profound immunosuppression it causes can lead to
short-term complications, including opportunistic infections
and rarer regimen-specific cardiac, renal, or other organ toxic
effects. Late complications may involve endocrine dysfunc-
tion, including gonadal failure, infertility, and thyroid dys-
function. Immune dysregulation can lead to viral reactiva-
tions, secondary malignant tumors, and secondary
autoimmunedisease.9Inourcohort,theautologousHSCTpro-
cedure was tolerable, and unexpected acute toxic effects were
not observed. The intense immune depletion resulted in vi-
ral reactivation in the first 2 months after autologous HSCT
(Table 2). Acquired amegakaryocytic thrombocytopenia, a rare
autoimmune hematopoietic condition, was observed in 1 pa-
tient and was likely transplant related: secondary autoim-
mune disease has been reported in 10% of patients after au-
tologousHSCTforautoimmunedisease.10AllautologousHSCT
complications resolved or stabilized with treatment.

Although there was no transplant-related mortality (TRM)
in our cohort, large registry data have reported TRM rates of
6% to 8% for recipients of autologous HSCT for autoimmune
diseases.2,3 Smaller studies9,11,12 report lower TRM estimates
of 1% to 5% owing to improved supportive care, patient selec-
tion, and increasing center-specific experience.
Prevalence of refractory MG has been estimated at 10%
of patients with generalized disease, and patients in this
cohort similarly exhibited infirmity despite treatment.
Refractory MG is reported more frequently in female
patients and those w ith muscle-spec ific kinase
antibodies.13,14 Our population had a similar female prepon-
derance (6 of 7 patients) but had predominantly AChR anti-
bodies (5 of 7 patients). There were 2 AChR antibody–
seronegative patients, representing 28% of our small cohort.
This rate is somewhat higher than prevalence estimates of
10% to 15%15 but may reflect unidentified muscle-specific
kinase antibody–seropositive patients. The AChR antibodies
were not measured after autologous HSCT in our cohort.
The presence of autoantibodies has not predicted response
in other autoimmune disease after autologous HSCT. Anti-
GADD antibodies did not disappear after autologous HSCT
of 2 patients with stiff-person syndrome4 despite clinical
evidence of disease remission, and cerebrospinal fluid oli-
goclonal bands did not disappear after autologous HSCT in
patients with multiple sclerosis who entered remission.16
Other therapies have been used to treat patients with re-
fractory MG, including thymectomy, cyclophosphamide, and
monoclonal antibodies, such as rituximab and eculizumab.1
Thymectomy might lead to some clinical improvement, but
complete remission is rare, and any advantages of additional
procedures may be restricted to patients with limited initial
thymectomy.1,17,18 Monthly pulses of cyclophosphamide or a
single cycle of high-dose cyclophosphamide without autolo-
gous HSCT resulted in clinical improvement in most patients
in a small observational study and a small randomized clini-
cal trial19,20; however, complete remission and CSR were
achieved in only a few. In a large cohort of patients experienc-
ing neurologic and nonneurologic autoimmune disease, high-
dose cyclophosphamide without autologous HSCT has dem-
onstrated overall response rates up to 95%, but only 20% of
patients remain event free after 5 years.21,22 Rituximab has
demonstrated promising results in retrospective observa-
tional studies23-27 in which complete remission was variably
achieved (12%-78%) at median follow-up times of 18, 32, and
39 months. Eculizumab has not been extensively studied, but
a statistically significant improvement in quality-of-life mea-
sures was reported in 6 of 7 treated patients in a 14-patient,
phase 2, randomized, multicenter crossover study.28
A single report29 of 1 patient with MG undergoing alloge-
neic HSCT describes a treatment-free remission with minor re-
sidual symptoms. The role of allogeneic HSCT in MG is lim-
ited, however, by its high mortality, with TRM rates reported
as high as 38% in HSCT for other autoimmune disease and the
occurrence of secondary MG as an infrequent manifestation
of graft-vs-host disease.3,30-32
Compared with these alternative therapies, responses af-
ter autologous HSCT were more consistent (7 of 7 patients),
complete (CSR), and sustained (29-149 months). We postu-
late that autologous HSCT is sufficiently rigorous to elimi-
nate autoreactivity and that it subsequently reestablishes a
long-lasting immune system that is functional and self-
tolerant, obviating the need for maintenance immunosup-
pression or additional treatment. In comparison, the global
immunosuppression produced by alternative therapies insuf-
ficiently suppresses autoreactivity and compromises
normal protective immune function, leading to opportunis-
tic infections and cancer in the long term.
The patients in this cohort were heterogeneous in regard
to the MG therapy received before autologous HSCT. Notably,
none of these patients had been treated with rituximab, ecu-
lizumab, cyclophosphamide, or prednisone doses greater than
60 mg/d. It is uncertain whether these alternate therapies or
greater dose intensities might have improved control of MG in
these patients. The optimal treatment and the specific role of
autologous HSCT remain uncertain for patients with MG that
remains active after several immunosuppressive agents have
failed. In the absence of clear evidence, the use of autologous
HSCT needs to be made on a case-by-case basis, balancing the
potentiallydurabletreatment-freeremissionachievedafterau-
tologous HSCT against its comparatively higher toxicity and
resource needs and against the outcomes achievable by alter-
native treatments.
Our study was constrained by the retrospective nature of
our analysis, which limited the breadth of available baseline
and follow-up data. The small sample size and single-
institution study environment may also limit the generaliz-
ability of our findings. The successful care of patients under-
going autologous HSCT requires significant institutional
infrastructureandmedicalexpertise.RatesofautologousHSCT
complications and TRM are consistently higher in less expe-
rienced institutions.11 We would caution against the use of au-
tologous HSCT for MG outside specialized centers with expe-
rience in HSCT and the care of patients with severe MG.
Conclusions
The ability to control autoimmunity by autologous HSCT has
been demonstrated in other treatment-refractory autoim-
mune conditions, including neurologic diseases.2-5 We re-
port the effectiveness of autologous HSCT for inducing long-
term, treatment-free MG control for patients with severe
disease that has not responded to other treatments. The role
of autologous HSCT for MG warrants further exploration with
prospective testing.
