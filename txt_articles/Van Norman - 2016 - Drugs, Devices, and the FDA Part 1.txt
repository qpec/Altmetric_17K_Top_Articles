Drugs, Devices, and the FDA: Part 1
An Overview of Approval Processes for Drugs
Gail A. Van Norman, MD
SUMMARY
Over the last 150 years, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has evolved from a small division of the U.S. Patent
Office to 1 of the largest consumer protection agencies in the world. Its mission includes ensuring that new medical
treatments reach the public as quickly as possible while simultaneously ensuring that new treatments are both safe and
effective. In the face of urgent consumer need, the FDA has faced criticism that its processes are too lengthy and costly
and that the time to new drug release is significantly longer in the United States than in other Western countries. Calls
from the public to loosen FDA regulations to facilitate more rapid approval of drugs and devices have been countered by
the occurrence of patient harm and deaths after some approved drugs have reached the marketplace. New drug and
device approval in the United States take an average of 12 and 7 years, respectively, from pre-clinical testing to
approval. Costs for development of medical devices run into millions of dollars, and a recent study suggests that the
entire cost for a new drug is in excess of $1 billion. For investigators seeking approval for new drugs and devices, FDA
processes can be formidable. This 2-part series is intended to provide an overview of the steps involved in bringing new
drugs and devices through the FDA process. Part 1 concerns the process of new drug approvals. Part 2 continues with
approval of medical devices. (J Am Coll Cardiol Basic Trans Science 2016;1:170–9) © 2016 The Authors. Published by

R
egulation of the development, production,
marketing, and sales of medical pharmaceu-
ticals and devices entails paradoxical goals.
It must ensure that new and effective medical treat-
ments reach the public rapidly while simultaneously
providing protection from ineffective or even unsafe
therapies and from predatory marketing practices
that tout unproven remedies to vulnerable patients.
In the United States, these regulatory functions fall
to the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA).
The FDA is the oldest consumer protection agency
in the United States, originating in the U.S. Patent
Office in 1848, and later inherited by the Department
of Agriculture in 1862 (1). The modern function of
the agency in oversight of drug and medical device
marketing was ultimately codified in the Pure Food
and Drug Act of 1906 (2,3), which was passed in
response
to
a
pressing
need
to
curb
interstate
markets for adulterated and mishandled food and
pharmaceuticals. The Federal Food, Drug, and Cos-
metics Act of 1938 required all drugs to be approved
for safety by the FDA (1). This mission was expanded
in 1962 by the Kefauver-Harris amendments that
added the requirement that drugs be proven “effec-
tive” as well as safe, and placed strict controls on
the use of investigational drugs (2). Regulations
regarding drug safety oversight were expanded in
1976 to include medical devices (1,2).
Over the course of the 20th century, the role of
the FDA has undergone a significant metamorphosis
due
to
expanding
federal
regulations,
increasing
complexity of drugs and devices, and the growth of the
pharmaceutical industry into a major economic force
in the United States. Today, the United States has
among
the
most
stringent
regulations
regarding
medical drug and device development and marketing,

 and the FDA has grown from that small division in the
patent office to 1 of the largest consumer safety
agencies in the world. Its core mission remains the
same: to provide consumers with assurance that
medical drugs and devices that reach the marketplace
have proven safety and efficacy in the roles for which
they have been tested and approved. But, this mission
has faced criticism and calls from an increasingly
demanding consumer base to provide more rapid
development, approval, and release of new products.
Strict regulation may have served the public with
enhanced assurance of therapeutic safety, but pro-
gressive concerns of a so-called “drug lag” have
resulted from an increasingly complex regulatory
environment and the expense associated with drug
development. Delay in the development and market-
ing of new pharmaceuticals was evidenced by a
decline in the number of drugs approved by the FDA
from an average of 50 drugs annually in the late 1950s
to approximately 17 per year after 1965 (2,4). It is
unclear
whether
FDA
regulations
were
entirely
responsible for the deceleration, because foreign
countries also experienced a lag (2,5,6), but it was
nevertheless obvious that new drugs and devices
were often reaching the market in other countries
months to years before achieving FDA approval in the
United States (2). Modern regulations allowing for
expanded access and accelerated approval for drugs
to treat life-threatening conditions have their origins
in the public outcry over delays in access to acquired
immune deficiency syndrome treatments in the 1980s
(7). But, movements to “deregulate” drug develop-
ment by loosening FDA regulations have been weak-
ened by the occurrence of major safety incidents, such
as with benoxaprofen in 1982 (2). The nonsteroidal
anti-inflammatory agent, marketed under the brand
name Oraflex, was released to the public but then
withdrawn when patient deaths were reported in the
United Kingdom (8,9). Thus the drug/device devel-
opment environment in the United States involves a
constant balance between accelerating pressures to
expedite effective therapies to the public, and the
mission to minimize major adverse events (10).
Today, the path from initial demonstration that a
molecule may have therapeutic potential to the pro-
duction of an approved drug involves pre-clinical
testing, complex clinical trials in humans, and post-
trial regulatory approval by the FDA. For drugs, this
process can take 10 to 15 years and cost millions of
dollars (11). A recent analysis suggests that the actual
cost of taking a new drug from concept to market as of
2014 is now above $1.3 billion (12). Approximately 1 in
1,000 potential drugs is graduated to human clinical
trials after pre-clinical testing in the United States,
and almost 9 of every 10 new drugs then fails
in the human testing phase. In 1 study, 50%
of all drugs reaching the final stage (Phase III)
of clinical testing did not make it to market
(13). The problem is not unique to the United
States; a recent analysis concluded in 2011 by
the Centre for Medicine Research in the
United Kingdom found that in the prior 3
years Phase
II and III
clinical trials had
experienced rising failure rates, with only
18% of drugs making it out of Phase II to
Phase III testing (14,15).
The pathways for approval of medical devices are
shorter and generally less costly when compared with
the regulatory process for drugs. Although the drug
development takes on average 12 years from concept
to market, the same process for medical devices av-
erages 3 to 7 years (16).
For researchers involved in the clinical develop-
ment and testing of putative drugs and devices, the
process of FDA approval can be daunting and difficult
to navigate. This first part of a 2-part series is inten-
ded to provide an overview of the steps in bringing a
drug through the process of clinical trials and FDA
approval. The second part of this series will discuss
the process of obtaining approval to study devices,
which have their own unique pathway.
PART 1: FDA APPROVAL OF NEW DRUGS
WHAT IS A DRUG? Not every substance taken by
patients “for their health” is considered a drug by the
FDA (Table 1). The FDA defines herbal products,
vitamins, and other complementary medical thera-
pies as “dietary supplements” (17). As such, they are
regulated by the Center for Drug Evaluation and
Research (CDER) of the FDA and are subject to
guidelines by the Dietary Supplement Health and
Education Act of 1994 (18), but they are not subject to
the rigorous tests required of substances that are
defined as “drugs.”
Prior to ever reaching a clinical researcher’s hands,
all
new
drug
development
follows
a
common
pathway. Basic research leads to conceptualization of
TABLE 1

 a
drug,
followed
by
pre-clinical
development
involving in vitro and in vivo studies and drug pro-
totype design (Table 2). When a substance is ready for
clinical study, but prior to any testing in human
subjects, the drug developer must involve the FDA.
This process begins when the drug’s sponsor (usually
the drug manufacturer or distributor) files an inves-
tigational
new
drug
(IND)
application
with
the
agency. Federal law requires that a drug be the sub-
ject of an approved marketing application for it to be
legally shipped across state lines. An approved IND
application provides the developer with a technical
exemption to this federal regulation, so that clinical
investigators can distribute a drug to different study
centers across the United States (19).
THE
IND APPLICATION:
3
BASIC
PATHWAYS
TO
APPROVAL. There are 2 categories of INDs (“com-
mercial” and “research”) and 3 types of IND applica-
tions: investigator IND, emergency use investigational
new drug (EIND), and treatment IND (19).
All drugs will go through review by a committee, or
“new drug division,” specializing in the class of drug
in question on the basis of the anticipated purpose of
the drug. The FDA encourages investigators to seek
early consultation with the appropriate new drug re-
view division through the Pre-Investigational New
Drug Application Consultation Program (20) prior to
submitting a formal IND application. Early collabo-
ration prior to IND applications can avoid issuance of
suggestions, mandatory changes, or clinical holds on
the application and are well worth the time and
effort. Collaborative conversations can be initiated by
contacting the appropriate review division (20). The
review division can provide valuable guidance about
information necessary for an IND submission. The
FDA provides specific names and contact numbers at
the FDA web site, arranged according to therapeutic
class of drug (21).
In addition to the pre-investigational consultation,
the FDA provides a number of guidance documents
that can be useful in assembling the necessary data
and materials for the IND application (22), as well as
information and contact numbers for submitting an
EIND application (detailed in the following text).
All IND applications require the investigator to
supply 3 basic categories of information: 1) data
regarding
pre-clinical
animal
and
toxicological
studies and any previous human experience with the
drug (e.g., foreign experience); 2) manufacturing in-
formation, including the composition, manufacturer,
stability, and controls; and 3) the clinical protocols of
the
study,
information
about
the
investigators
proving that they are qualified to conduct the trial, as
well as commitments to obtain informed consent
from subjects, obtain institutional review board (IRB)
approval, and adhere to any regulations regarding
INDs (23).
Pathway 1: the investigator IND. An investigator
IND is submitted by a physician, sometimes on behalf
of an institution or “sponsor” such as a pharmaceu-
tical company (Table 3). The investigator will both
initiate and conduct the investigation and direct the
dispensing and administration of the drug.
The investigator must wait at least 30 days after
submitting an IND application to begin any clinical
trials. If the FDA does not object within that time,
clinical Phase I testing can begin (24). However, the
FDA may respond to the application with suggestions
for
the
study
or
with
mandatory
change
re-
quirements. Although “suggestions” are changes that
are not required for the IND study to proceed, they
should nevertheless be taken very seriously. The FDA
review panel consists of clinicians and researchers
who may have considerable experience with related
drugs or drugs in a similar class, and such suggestions

TABLE 3
Summary of Steps and Timeline in the Investigator
IND Application
Step 1
Contact the appropriate division of the FDA and set up a
Pre-IND Consultation Program; check FDA guidance
documents to be sure the new drug does not qualify
for an exemption from IND application (uncommon,
but can occur with some generic drugs and radiological
products)
Step 2
Submit the application (original and 2 copies) to:
Food and Drug Administration
Center for Drug Evaluation and Research

Beltsville, Maryland 20705-1266
Step 3
If the FDA does not raise an objection within 30 days of
submission of the application, the investigator may
proceed
Step 4
If the FDA issues a “clinical hold,” or responds with
suggestions or mandatory changes, address these
issues and resubmit the application
FDA ¼ U.S. Food and Drug Administration; IND ¼ investigational new drug.

 are not made lightly. Furthermore, it is vital for the
approval process that the investigator maintains a
collaborative relationship with the FDA reviewers to
avoid
issues
further
down
the
road.
Mandatory
changes are just that: failure to make the required
changes will result in FDA issuance of a “clinical
hold” (24), preventing the study from legally pro-
ceeding until the FDA is assured of the safety of the
study. Although the FDA must respond within 30
days to challenges of a clinical hold by the investi-
gator, technically there is no deadline for resolution
of issues causing clinical holds. Typically, a clinical
hold will result in a study delay of a year or more (25).
Pathway 2: the EIND. An EIND asks the FDA to
approve use of an experimental drug in an emergency
situation that does not allow time for a standard IND
process or IRB approval (26). This type of application
may also be submitted to authorize use in a patient or
patients who do not meet study criteria or if no
approved study protocol exists. EINDs are initiated by
direct contact with the appropriate division of the
FDA. Special contact numbers for EIND applications,
including an emergency contact number for night and
weekend contacts, are listed in Table 4. This contact
information is current as of March 4, 2016, but may be
updated and can be found at the FDA web site (26). In
emergency cases, the FDA will often authorize use of
the agent in advance of a full IND, which must then be
completed in a timely fashion. The process and
timeline for EIND applications are summarized in
Table 5.
Pathway
3:
the
treatment
IND. Treatment IND
applications ask for approval to use an experimental
drug that is showing promise in clinical studies before
completion of the studies, FDA review, and final
approval. These are also called “expanded use INDs”
(27). Treatment IND regulations went into effect in
1987, largely as a response to public activism sur-
rounding the limited availability of azidothymidine
during the drug’s development (7). Additional accel-
erated approval measures were instituted by The
Food and Drug Administration Modernization Act of
1997 (28), which allows the FDA to “fast track” certain
products that meet 2 criteria: 1) the product must
concern a life-threatening or serious condition; and 2)
it must have the potential to address an unmet
medical need (29). Four requirements must be met
before issuance of a treatment IND: 1) the drug is
intended for treatment of a serious or immediately
life-threatening disease; 2) there is no satisfactory
alternative treatment; 3) the drug is already under
investigation or trials are complete; and 4) the drug
sponsor is actively pursuing approval. Prospective
IRB review and informed consent are mandatory. The
process and timelines for treatment IND applications
follow a similar pathway to those of regular INDs, but
requirements for clinical evidence differ.
THE CLINICAL TRIALS. Clinical trials establish the
safety, efficacy, and effectiveness (Table 6) of new
drugs and are divided into Phase 0, I, II, and III trials.
Post-approval surveillance trials are generally termed
Phase IV trials. Characteristics of the different clinical
trials phases can be found in Table 7, and major steps
in the clinical trials phase and IND review are sum-
marized in Table 8. The FDA encourages investigators
and
sponsors
to
communicate
directly
with
the
appropriate FDA review section during each phase of
testing.
Phase 0 clinical trials. Only about 10% of IND ap-
plications ever result in clinically approved drugs

 (15,30). Drug development is lengthy and expensive,
and many drugs fail very late in the process after
expenditure of significant time and resources. As new
agents increasingly are molecularly targeted, it seems
rational to perform early testing to assess such agents
early in the pharmacodynamic assay. Such trials,
termed “Phase 0,” or “exploratory” trials, were first
allowed in 2006 as a means of facilitating the drug
approval (and elimination) process (30). Phase 0 clin-
ical trials require submission of an exploratory IND
followed by a full IND.
Phase 0 trials represent the earliest, first-in-man
use of a proposed drug therapy (31). They are car-
ried out in very small cohorts (10 to 15 patients), with
dose levels <1% of the dose calculated to produce a
clinical effect (32,33) and administration schedules
not expected to produce any clinical toxicity. Dura-
tion of dosing in any patient is anticipated to be <1
week (34).
A Phase 0 trial can help determine whether a drug
engages its expected target and is likely to have the
anticipated clinical effect in human subjects (33). It
can also illuminate the pharmacokinetic and phar-
macodynamic characteristics of the drug. These trials
may weed out ineffective therapies early in the FDA
process and help the researcher choose between
competing
analogue
agents
for
further
clinical
development. Approval for a Phase 0 trial generally
requires less toxicity testing than for full Phase I tri-
als. Phase 0 trials can also be conducted while
awaiting FDA review of a standard IND application,
thus providing valuable information regarding hu-
man effects while avoiding delays in the full FDA
approval process.
Phase I trials. The exploratory (Phase 0) INDs are
actually a subset of Phase I human subject trials of all
new drugs. Exploratory INDs progress to “full” Phase
I clinical trials if early results are promising. The
purposes of a Phase I trial are to provide initial
safety evaluation, determine safe dosing ranges, and
identify common side effects and the toxicity profile

TABLE 6
Safety, Efficacy, and Effectiveness
Safety determines the highest tolerable dose or optimal dose needed
to achieve the desired clinical benefit and potential adverse effects
in that exposure range.
Efficacy determines whether a drug has a positive clinical benefit over
placebo or other intervention. Efficacy tests involve “ideal,” that is,
strictly controlled conditions.
Effectiveness describes a drug’s clinical benefits in a “real world”
situation, for example, where patients may have comorbid
conditions or other medications that interact with the drug, and
where drug administration may not following strict study
guidelines.

 of the drug. The number of subjects is still low, usu-
ally between 20 and 80 (35), and subjects are gener-
ally healthy because clinical effectiveness is not an
endpoint of the trial.
Single-dose studies are the usual starting place of
Phase I trials: the subject is given a single dose of
drug no greater than one-tenth the highest dose
associated with no adverse effects in the most sen-
sitive animal safety studies (34). Many researchers
now believe that single-dose toxicity trials should not
be carried out simultaneously in multiple subjects—
meaning that the drug should be tested in a single
subject and enough time be allowed between subjects
such that a severe reaction in any subject will lead to
termination of the study before other subjects are
exposed (25,36). A recent, disastrous clinical trial
serves to underscore this concern; in the initial Phase
I trial of TGN1412, an immunomodulatory drug to
treat leukemia and autoimmune diseases, all 6 sub-
jects were dosed on the same day successively. Every
single subject experienced unexpected, agonizing,
and immediate life-threatening complications. Had
dosing of participants been spread out over several
days, reaction of the first subject likely would have
led to termination of the trial prior to other partici-
pant exposures (37).
Single-dose trials are followed by single and mul-
tiple ascending-dose trials (Phase Ia and Ib trials,
respectively). In single ascending-dose (Phase Ia)
trials, a small group of subjects (typically 3) are all
given a single, higher dose. If no adverse effects are
noted, another small set of subjects receives a further
escalated dose, and this process continues until
either pre-calculated pharmacokinetic safety levels
are reached or until adverse effects begin appearing.
If at a given dosing level any subject experiences an
unacceptable side effect, then additional subjects
(e.g., 3 more) are dosed to confirm. When unaccept-
able side effects appear, the drug is determined to
have reached its maximum tolerated dose, generally
described as the dose preceding the one with the
intolerable adverse effects.
Multiple ascending-dose (Phase Ib) studies eval-
uate the pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics of
multiple doses of the drug. Groups of patients receive
multiple low doses of the drug, and biological sam-
ples (blood, fluids, urine) are collected and analyzed.
The dose is then escalated in further groups, to a pre-
determined level.
Phase II clinical trials. Following favorable initial
safety testing, the investigator or sponsor submits the
safety information regarding the drug to the FDA,
incorporating any new information that has been
gained in Phase I testing. The submission includes
any changes in drug manufacture or preparation
anticipated for Phase II studies.
The goals of Phase II trials are to explore the effi-
cacy of the drug while continuing to establish safety.
These trials are larger (100 to 300 subjects), so that
less-common side effects can be seen, and the trials
involve patients who have a condition that is a ther-
apeutic target of the drug (35). Tests are often con-
ducted in comparison to placebo. Escalating dosing
may be incorporated, exploring the therapeutic range
of the drug.
Phase III clinical trials. Prior to initiating Phase III
trials, the investigator or sponsor must again submit
updated information to the FDA regarding continuing
safety for subjects, incorporating any safety and
toxicity information gained in Phase II testing. Phase
III trials are the final confirmation of safety and effi-
cacy, and are carried out in large cohorts (1,000 to
3,000 subjects). The trials evaluate effectiveness,
monitor side effects, and compare the drug with
commonly used alternative treatments.
Following successful completion of Phase III clin-
ical trials, the drug sponsor can file a New Drug
Application (NDA) with the CDER of the FDA. This
application constitutes a request by the sponsor to
manufacture and sell the drug in the United States.
THE NDA. The NDA (38) includes all data concerning
the drug; all information about the manufacturing
process and facilities, quality control, and assurance;
a complete product description (chemical formula,
specifications, pharmacodynamics, and pharmacoki-
netics);
indications;
labeling;
and
proposed
risk
evaluation and mitigation processes if applicable. A
typical NDA can run 100,000 pages, and according to
the Office of the Federal Register, the application fee
in 2016 for an NDA that requires clinical data is
$2,374,200 (39,40). The FDA has 60 days to deter-
mine if they will file the application once it is
received (41).
FDA reviewers will evaluate clinical data, analyze
drug samples, inspect the production facilities, and
check proposed labeling. The Federal Food, Drug, and
Cosmetics Act requires that there be “substantial
evidence” of drug safety and efficacy (42). The FDA
interprets this as needing at least 2 adequate and well-
controlled Phase III trials with convincing evidence of
effectiveness (29), although this is not a guarantee of
approval. The FDA often convenes advisory panels
of experts to review the data, and usually follows
panel
recommendations.
Approval
may
include
specific conditions, such as requirements for post-
approval (Phase IV) clinical studies, distribution re-
strictions, changes to labeling, or other requirements.

 FDA review occurs within 180 days of receipt of a
complete application (38). An accelerated process is
available for generic drugs, products that provide
“meaningful therapeutic benefit” over existing drugs,
those that concern serious or life-threatening condi-
tions, or those that address a previously unmet
medical need. If the application is found to have de-
ficiencies,
the
clock
stops
on
review
while
the
manufacturer is given an opportunity to respond to
the
deficiencies
or
withdraw
the
application.
If
approval
of
the
NDA
is
denied,
the
FDA
sends
a complete response letter describing specific de-
ficiencies and recommending ways for the applicant
to make the application viable. Unsuccessful appli-
cants may request a hearing.
Upon review and approval of the NDA, the manu-
facturer is free to manufacture and market the drug. A
summary of the timeline, costs, and overall proba-
bility of success for the drug development process can
be found in Figure 1 (12,41).
FIGURE 1
Time, Money, and Success: Stages in Drug Development
The highest failure rates occurs in Phase II testing, which is the first stage in which doses of drug in humans are escalated to reach levels
expected to be clinically active (i.e., the first doses at which efficacy may fail and less common side effects appear). Cumulative probability of a
drug reaching U.S. Food and Drug Administration approval declines with each stage. The overall probability of a drug passing all stages is
approximately 11% as of 2014 (12).

 SUMMARY
The United States has arguably the most stringent
regulations regarding approval of medical drugs and
devices in the world. The average time from FDA
application to approval of drugs is 12 years, and the
estimated average cost of taking a new drug from
concept to market exceeds $1 billion. The FDA faces
constant, often contradictory pressure to shorten the
approval process, while still preserving or enhancing
the safety and efficacy of drugs and devices. Thus,
regulatory processes are under constant scrutiny to
identify means of streamlining approval processes
while not compromising the primary mission of the
agency.
After approval of an IND application, the FDA al-
lows human Phase 0, I, II, and III studies, provided
safety and efficacy are demonstrated at the appro-
priate clinical testing phase. For NDA, the FDA re-
quires “substantial evidence” of drug safety and
efficacy, and interprets this as needing at least 2
adequate and well-controlled Phase III trials with
convincing evidence of effectiveness (Table 9). Some
approvals may require more studies.
The FDA encourages early and regular communi-
cation from investigators and sponsors seeking drug
approval, with a purpose of avoiding application
failures or required modifications or clinical holds
that may waste valuable time, effort, and finances in
the process of bringing a drug to market.
