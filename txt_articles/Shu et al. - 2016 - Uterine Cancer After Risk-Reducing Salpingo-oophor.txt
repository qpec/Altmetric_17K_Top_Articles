Abstract
Importance—The link between BRCA mutations and uterine cancer is unclear. Therefore, 
although risk-reducing salpingo-oophorectomy (RRSO) is standard treatment among women with 
BRCA mutations (BRCA+ women), the role of concomitant hysterectomy is controversial.
Objective—To determine the risk for uterine cancer and distribution of specific histologic 
subtypes in BRCA+ women after RRSO without hysterectomy.
Design, Setting, and Participants—This multicenter prospective cohort study included 1083 
women with a deleterious BRCA1 or BRCA2 mutation identified from January 1, 1995, to 
December 31, 2011, at 9 academic medical centers in the United States and the United Kingdom 
who underwent RRSO without a prior or concomitant hysterectomy. Of these, 627 participants 
were BRCA1+; 453, BRCA2+; and 3, both. Participants were prospectively followed up for a 
median 5.1 (interquartile range [IQR], 3.0–8.4) years after ascertainment, BRCA testing, or RRSO 
(whichever occurred last). Follow up data available through October 14, 2014, were included in 
the analyses. Censoring occurred at uterine cancer diagnosis, hysterectomy, last follow-up, or 
death. New cancers were categorized by histologic subtype, and available tumors were analyzed 
for loss of the wild-type BRCA gene and/or protein expression.
Main Outcomes and Measures—Incidence of uterine corpus cancer in BRCA+ women who 
underwent RRSO without hysterectomy compared with rates expected from the Surveillance, 
Epidemiology, and End Results database.
Results—Among the 1083 women women who underwent RRSO without hysterectomy at a 
median age 45.6 (IQR: 40.9 – 52.5), 8 incident uterine cancers were observed (4.3 expected; 
observed to expected [O:E] ratio, 1.9; 95% CI, 0.8–3.7; P = .09). No increased risk for 
endometrioid endometrial carcinoma or sarcoma was found after stratifying by subtype. Five 
serous and/or serous-like (serous/serous-like) endometrial carcinomas were observed (4 BRCA1+ 
and 1 BRCA2+) 7.2 to 12.9 years after RRSO (BRCA1: 0.18 expected [O:E ratio, 22.2; 95% CI, 
6.1–56.9; P < .001]; BRCA2: 0.16 expected [O:E ratio, 6.4; 95% CI, 0.2–35.5; P = .15]). Tumor 
analyses confirmed loss of the wild-type BRCA1 gene and/or protein expression in all 3 available 
serous/serous-like BRCA1+ tumors.

 Conclusions and Relevance—Although the overall risk for uterine cancer after RRSO was 
not increased, the risk for serous/serous-like endometrial carcinoma was increased in BRCA1+ 
women. This risk should be considered when discussing the advantages and risks of hysterectomy 
at the time of RRSO in BRCA1+ women.
Introduction
In 2002, Kauff et al1 and Rebbeck et al2 published the first 2 studies demonstrating that risk-
reducing salpingo-oophorectomy (RRSO) decreased the risk for breast and ovarian or 
fallopian tube cancer in women with mutations in the BRCA1 (OMIM 113705) (BRCA1+ 
women) or BRCA2 (OMIM 600185) (BRCA2+ women) gene. Subsequent studies have 
confirmed that RRSO not only reduces the risk for ovarian or fallopian tube cancer by 80% 
to 90% and the risk for breast cancer by 40% to 70%3–5 but also reduces disease-specific 
and overall mortality.4,5
Although RRSO is now part of standard management for BRCA+ women, the role of 
concomitant hysterectomy remains controversial.6,7 Some studies8,9 have suggested that 
BRCA+ women may be at higher risk for uterine corpus cancer, while others10 have 
suggested that the risk is predominantly associated with tamoxifen citrate use. Further 
reports11,12 have suggested that more aggressive, serous and/or serous-like (serous/serous-
like) endometrial carcinoma is overrepresented in BRCA+ women, but other studies13,14 
have not confirmed this. Clarification of this issue is particularly relevant, because the 
serous/serous-like subtype accounts for only about 10% of uterine corpus cancer cases but 
more than 40% of deaths due to the disease.15
To provide data relevant to these questions, we conducted a multicenter, prospective 
evaluation of uterine corpus cancer risk after RRSO in BRCA1+ and BRCA2+ women. We 
also examined whether specific histologic subtypes were overrepresented.
METHODS
Study Participants
Women were eligible for this study if they (1) had a deleterious BRCA mutation identified 
from January 1, 1995, to December 31, 2011; (2) underwent RRSO with their uterus left in 
situ; (3) did not have ovarian, fallopian tube, or uterine cancer before the later of genetic 
testing or RRSO; and (4) consented in writing to participation in one of several institutional 
review board–approved prospective follow-up studies conducted at the University of 
Pennsylvania, Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center, and 7 academic centers 
participating in the Prevention and Observation of Surgical End Points Study (PROSE 
Consortium), including Baylor–Charles A. Sammons Cancer Center, City of Hope Medical 
Center, Dana-Farber Cancer Institute, Fox Chase Cancer Center, Lombardi Cancer Center, 
Royal Marsden Hospital, and UCLA Jonsson Comprehensive Cancer Center.
Women were followed up via structured questionnaire and medical record review as 
previously described.1–3,16 Information regarding risk-reducing and therapeutic surgical 
procedures, medication exposures, and new malignant neoplasms was ascertained.

 Pathology reports were requested for all new uterine corpus cancers diagnosed during 
follow-up. No individuals were excluded owing to race or ethnicity. Race or ethnicity 
designations were self-reported and collected to assist in determining expected age- and 
race-specific cancer incidence.
Statistical Analysis
Follow-up time began from the latest of date of ascertainment, receipt of BRCA testing 
results, or RRSO. The main outcome of interest was the diagnosis of uterine cancer. 
Censoring events were hysterectomy, last follow-up, or death. Women were considered to be 
at risk from 30 years and older, and women with less than 6 months of follow-up were 
excluded. Follow-up data available through October 14, 2014, were included in the analyses.
Expected incidence of uterine cancer was calculated by multiplying woman-years at risk by 
the age- and race-specific data from the Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results 
database (SEER*Stat database: Incidence—SEER 18 registries, November 2012 [submitted 
2000–2010]), categorized by age into 5-year increments.17 Because 31% of US women have 
undergone hysterectomy by 60 years of age, expected incidences were adjusted for the age- 
and race-specific prevalence of hysterectomy, obtained using the 2010 Cross Tabulation 
Analysis Tool from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention Behavioral Risk Factor 
Surveillance System (BRFSS),18 and grouped in 5-year increments of age as indicated in the 
following equation:
To determine the expected incidence of specific histologic subtypes, we used codes from the 
International Classification of Diseases for Oncology (ICD-O) to assign SEER cases into 1 
of the following 5 histologic categories: (1) endometrioid endometrial carcinoma (eg, 
endometrioid, adenocarcinoma not otherwise specified); (2) serous/serous-like endometrial 
carcinoma (eg, serous, undifferentiated, carcinosarcoma); (3) clear cell carcinoma; (4) 
mucinous carcinoma; and (5) uterine sarcoma. Specific ICD-O codes assigned to each 
category are detailed in eTable 1 in the Supplement. Carcinosarcomas, which are epithelial 
cancers rather than sarcomas, were included in the serous/serous-like category, because 
these are frequently thought to have dedifferentiated from a serous precursor, and the 
carcinomatous component is the primary driver of tumor aggressiveness.19 Similarly, 
endometrial carcinomas with mixed histologic features were also classified as serous/serous-
like if a serous component was present, because the Cancer Genome Atlas Research 
Network recently demonstrated that most of these cases cluster in the copy-number high 
(serous-like) group.20 Observed cases were categorized in the same way based on pathologic 
reports, and in cases with available tumor specimens, review of primary tumor by the study 
pathologist (R.A.S.).
Exact 2-sided P values for observed to expected (O:E) ratios for cancers were calculated 
assuming a Poisson distribution of the observed values using the STATA statistical package 
(version 13; StataCorp). Confidence intervals were calculated for the lower and upper 2.5% 
limits compatible with the observed values. The cumulative risk through age 70 years for

 developing an incident uterine cancer, assuming the participant underwent RRSO at age 45 
years, was estimated by 2 methods, first assuming a constant annual risk and second 
assuming a constant relative risk compared with SEER rates. In the first approach, annual 
risk was determined by dividing the number of uterine cancers observed by the number of 
woman-years of observation. This annual risk was then multiplied by the number of years at 
risk (ie, 25). In the second approach, age-specific SEER incidence rates were multiplied by 
the relevant O:E ratio. These absolute risks, starting at age 45 years, were then summed 
through age 70 years. Analyses stratified by BRCA1/2 mutation type, breast cancer history, 
and prior tamoxifen exposure were also performed.
Immunohistochemical Analysis for BRCA1 Protein Expression
For uterine cancer cases from BRCA1+ women, available tumor specimens were analyzed 
for BRCA1 protein expression, as previously described.21 Briefly, the study pathologist 
assessed immunohistochemical staining intensity relative to an internal positive control. 
Loss of BRCA1 protein expression was predefined as less than 5% of cells staining with a 
positive internal control, whereas staining of greater than 10% was considered retention of 
BRCA1 protein expression.
Loss of Heterozygosity Analysis
For uterine cancer cases with available tumor, microdissected tumor and normal DNA were 
extracted from archival material and amplified using mutation-specific primers. Loss of 
heterozygosity was determined by comparing fragment distributions between normal and 
tumor amplicons.22 Loss of heterozygosity was predefined as a reduction of greater than 
50% of the wild-type allele at the site of the germline mutation in the tumor sample.
RESULTS
Of 1083 women who met the final eligibility criteria, 627 (57.9%) were BRCA1+, 453 
(41.8%) were BRCA2+, and 3 (0.3%) had mutations in both genes. The median age at 
RRSO was 45.6 (interquartile range [IQR], 40.9–52.5) years and the median follow-up was 
5.1 (IQR, 3.0–8.4) years. Seven hundred twenty-seven study participants (67.1%) had a 
history of breast cancer, and 273 of the 928 women (29.4%) with data available had used 
tamoxifen (eTable 2 in the Supplement).
During 6377 woman-years of follow-up, 8 women developed uterine cancer (O:E ratio, 1.9; 
95% CI, 0.8–3.7; P = .09) (Table 1 and eTable 3 in the Supplement). Two women developed 
endometrioid carcinoma (1 with International Federation of Gynecology and Obstetrics 
grade 1 and 1 with grade 2) (O:E ratio, 0.6; 95% CI, 0.1–2.0; P = .88), both within 3 years of 
RRSO. One woman developed leiomyosarcoma (O:E ratio, 7.1; 95% CI, 0.2–39.4; P = .13) 
1.4 years after RRSO. Five serous/serous-like endometrial carcinomas (1 high-grade 
carcinoma with serous and undifferentiated components; 1 high-grade carcinoma with 
serous and endometrioid features; 1 carcinosarcoma with a serous epithelial component; 1 
serous carcinoma with an undifferentiated component; and 1 pure serous carcinoma) were 
observed (O:E ratio, 14.8; 95% CI, 4.8–34.6; P < .001), 7.2 to 12.9 years after RRSO.

 Five of 627 BRCA1+ women developed uterine cancer (2.38 expected; O:E ratio, 2.1; 95% 
CI, 0.7–4.9; P = .09) during 3781 woman-years. Four serous/serous-like carcinomas (0.18 
expected; O:E ratio, 22.2; 95% CI, 6.1–56.9; P < .001) (Table 2) and 1 sarcoma (0.08 
expected; O:E ratio, 12.4; 95% CI, 0.3–69.3; P = .08) developed. With use of these data, the 
estimated risk for developing serous/serous-like carcinoma through age 70 years for a 
BRCA1+ woman undergoing RRSO at age 45 years was 2.6% (95% CI, 0.7%–6.8%), 
assuming a constant annual risk, and 4.7% (95% CI, 1.3%–12.1%), assuming a constant 
relative risk compared with SEER rates.
Three of 453 BRCA2+ women developed uterine carcinoma (1.91 expected; O:E ratio, 1.6; 
95% CI, 0.3–4.6; P = .30) during 2580 woman-years. Two endometrioid cases (1.60 
expected; O:E ratio, 1.2; 95% CI, 0.2–4.5; P = .48) and 1 serous/serous-like case (0.16 
expected; O:E ratio, 6.4; 95% CI, 0.2–35.5; P = .15) developed.
Four of five serous/serous-like carcinomas occurred in women with prior breast cancer, 3 of 
whom used tamoxifen (eTable 3 in the Supplement). One woman with a history of breast 
cancer without tamoxifen use developed leiomyosarcoma. All women with serous/serous-
like carcinoma or sarcoma received adjuvant chemotherapy and/or radiotherapy. Two of 5 
women with serous/serous-like carcinoma have had disease recurrence, 1.6 and 2.0 years 
after diagnosis, and one ultimately died of the disease.
Immunohistochemistry Analysis
Tumor tissue from 3 of 5 serous/serous-like carcinomas and the leiomyosarcoma were 
available. All of these occurred in BRCA1+ women. When BRCA1 protein expression was 
examined, all 3 serous/serous-like carcinomas demonstrated loss of protein expression 
compared with intact internal control (Figure, A–C). The leiomyosarcoma, however, 
retained BRCA1 protein expression (Figure, D).
Loss of Heterozygosity Analysis
Two of 3 available serous/serous-like carcinomas demonstrated loss of the wild-type 
BRCA1 allele (patients A and B, eFigure in the Supplement). The other available serous/
serous-like carcinoma and the leiomyosarcoma retained the wild-type BRCA1 allele 
(patients C and D, eFigure in the Supplement).
Analysis Stratified for Personal History of Breast Cancer and Prior Tamoxifen Use
Given that only the serous/serous-like subtype was observed more frequently than expected, 
we limited the following analyses to the serous/serous-like subtype tumors. We observed 4 
serous/serous-like carcinomas in 727 women with prior breast cancer (0.26 expected; O:E 
ratio, 15.5; 95% CI, 4.2–39.7; P < .001). One serous/serous-like carcinoma was seen in 356 
women without prior breast cancer (0.08 expected; O:E ratio, 12.6; 95% CI, 0.3–70.3; P = .
08). Three serous/serous-like carcinomas were seen in 273 tamoxifen-exposed women (0.12 
expected; O:E ratio, 24.4; 95% CI, 5.0–71.3; P < .001). Two serous/serous-like carcinomas 
occurred in 655 women without prior tamoxifen use (0.18 expected; O:E ratio, 11.3; 95% 
CI, 1.4–40.8; P = .01) (Table 2).

 DISCUSSION
These results suggest that BRCA1+ women undergoing RRSO without hysterectomy remain 
at increased risk for serous/serous-like endometrial carcinoma. The lack of BRCA1 protein 
expression in all 3 available BRCA1-associated serous/serous-like specimens and the loss of 
the wild-type BRCA1 allele in 2 of 3 available tumors support the biologic plausibility that 
the loss of BRCA1 function was important in the tumorigenesis of the serous/serous-like 
cancers seen in our cohort.
Whether uterine cancer is a BRCA-associated tumor has long been controversial. The Breast 
Cancer Linkage Consortium showed an increased risk for uterine cancer in BRCA1+ women 
(relative risk, 2.65; 95% CI, 1.69–4.16; P < .001), but not in BRCA2+ women.8,9 Similarly, 
Segev et al10 found an increased risk for endometrial cancer for BRCA1+ women 
(standardized incidence ratio,1.91; 95% CI, 1.06–3.19; P = .03). However, this risk may 
have been limited to tamoxifen-exposed women. Importantly, neither study commented on 
the histologic subtypes of these cancers.
Several studies have also evaluated the potential association between serous endometrial 
carcinoma and BRCA mutations. In 2000, Goshen et al13 examined 56 patients with serous 
endometrial carcinoma and did not identify any BRCA mutations. However, only selective 
founder and protein-truncating mutations in exon 11 of BRCA1 and exons 10 and 11 of 
BRCA2 were examined. In 2001, Levine et al14 similarly did not find any founder BRCA 
mutations in 21 serous/serous-like endometrial carcinomas from individuals of Jewish 
heritage. However, 2 independent Israeli studies11,12 since reported that 4 of 31 (12.9%) and 
7 of 59 (11.9%) consecutive Jewish patients with serous endometrial carcinoma, 
respectively, carried a BRCA1 mutation. Also, a recent multi-institutional study identified 
nonfounder BRCA1 mutations in 3 of 151 unselected patients (2.0%) with serous 
endometrial carcinoma.23 When all 5 studies to date are pooled, 3 of 207 serous/serous-like 
carcinomas in admixed US and Canadian patients (1.4%) and 11 of 111 serous/serous-like 
carcinomas in US and Israeli Jews (9.9%) had a detectable BRCA1 mutation (eTable 4 in the 
Supplement). This finding is in contrast to the 0.12% to 0.29% and 1.1% to 1.2% expected 
mutation rates in these respective populations.24
In the only other prospective study analyzing the risk for uterine cancer after RRSO in 
BRCA mutation carriers with complete histologic information available, 2 endometrioid 
carcinomas developed during 6 years of follow-up in 315 BRCA+ women. No serous/
serous-like carcinomas or sarcomas were seen.25 However, patients could be ascertained and 
followed up before genetic testing, which could result in underestimation of risk in 
aggressive cancers such as serous carcinoma. Furthermore, that study included 70% fewer 
BRCA1+ women, with a median age at RRSO 3 years younger than in our report, which 
potentially limits the previous study’s power to detect an increased incidence of serous/
serous-like endometrial carcinoma.
In our study, all 3 BRCA1-associated serous/serous-like carcinomas with available tissue 
showed clear loss of BRCA1 protein expression. In 2 cases, we also demonstrated that loss 
of the wild-type BRCA1 allele was the likely cause. In the third case, the mechanism for

 protein expression loss was not elucidated. This result may be analogous to the situation in 
BRCA-associated serous ovarian cancer, in which 19% to 28% of BRCA-associated ovarian 
cancers do not demonstrate loss of heterozygosity,26 suggesting other mechanisms of BRCA 
silencing are important in a significant percentage of BRCA-associated disease.
Recent investigations have proposed that most serous ovarian cancers originate from the 
fallopian tubes.27,28 Given this hypothesis, there is speculation that some serous endometrial 
cancers may be metastases from concomitant tubal primary tumors. However, for most cases 
with coexisting serous cancers in the fallopian tube and endometrium, the endometrial 
component appears to be superficial or noninvasive.29 In contrast, all serous/serous-like 
carcinomas in our series presented with myoinvasive disease no fewer than 7 years after 
RRSO, arguing against these being tubal metastases. Further, the fallopian tubes and 
endometrium share an embryological precursor, the paramesonephric (Müllerian) ducts. It is 
therefore plausible the endometrium may be susceptible to similar BRCA-mediated 
carcinogenesis as the fallopian tube.
Possible confounding by a history of breast cancer and/or tamoxifen exposure remains a 
consideration. Several studies have suggested that women with serous endometrial 
carcinoma are more likely to have a personal or a family history of breast cancer than 
women without cancer30 or women with endometrioid carcinoma.31,32 The cause of this 
association is unclear, but as none of these studies have examined BRCA mutation status, 
the association may be explained in part by BRCA1 mutations. The relationship between 
tamoxifen exposure and serous/serous-like endometrial carcinoma is less clear33; however, 
recent reports have suggested an association.34,35 While tamoxifen exposure cannot explain 
the loss of the wild-type BRCA1 allele seen in 2 of the 3 available serous/serous-like tumors 
in our series, it may act as a risk modifier in the presence of decreased BRCA1 protein 
expression, as posited by Wen et al.36 Given this possibility, tamoxifen exposure may 
account for some of the serous-like carcinoma risk seen in our report.
Although this report is, to our knowledge, the largest prospective study to date, relatively 
few events were observed. Given this, we have estimated the penetrance of serous/serous-
like cancer through age 70 years in women with BRCA1 mutations using 2 approaches. In 
the first approach, we assumed a constant relative risk of 22.2 compared with SEER rates 
from ages 45 through 70 years. We also took a more conservative approach and assumed a 
constant annual risk for serous/serous-like endometrial cancer of 1.06 per 1000 woman-
years (4 cases observed in 3781 woman-years). Although future studies will be required to 
determine which of these approaches is most appropriate, both approaches estimate a risk 
for serous/serous-like endometrial cancer through age 70 years of at least 2.6%, which is 
likely clinically important given the high morbidity and mortality rates for serous/serous-like 
disease. Misclassification and/or underreporting of rare uterine cancer subtypes in SEER is 
also possible, which could lead to inflation of our O:E ratios. However, this possibility is 
unlikely to be a major effect, as 10.3% of uterine cancers reported in SEER are serous/
serous-like, consistent with other epidemiologic studies.37 In addition, bias could have been 
introduced because we excluded cases from SEER with unknown histologic subtypes from 
our calculated expected rates. Such cases only accounted for 0.77% of the total corpus 
cancers in SEER and therefore are unlikely to substantially alter our results. Because we

 only had 1 BRCA2-related serous event in our study, we cannot conclusively comment on 
whether BRCA2+ women have a significantly increased risk for serous/serous-like 
endometrial carcinoma, and the answer to this question awaits further studies.
Although abdominal hysterectomy with bilateral salpingo-oophorectomy is clearly 
associated with increased complications and costs compared with RRSO alone, comparison 
of complications and costs may be more appropriate when both hysterectomy and RRSO are 
performed via a minimally invasive (laparoscopic or robotic) approach. In 2 recent analyses 
of data from the Perspective database (Premier, Inc), 5.3% of 4971 women undergoing 
laparoscopic hysterectomy had an intraoperative, surgical site, or medical complication.38 
This rate was similar to the 6.0% complication rate of 3632 women undergoing laparoscopic 
oophorectomy.39 Laparoscopic hysterectomy was more expensive to perform, with a median 
total cost of $6679 compared with $4737 for laparscopic oophorectomy.38,39 Because the 
number of hysterectomies necessary to prevent 1 serous cancer case during 25 years of 
follow-up ranges from 21.2 to 37.9, an incremental cost ranging from $41 170 to $73 601 to 
prevent 1 serous cancer case would likely be considered reasonable. Other potential long-
term complications of hysterectomy include urinary incontinence and pelvic prolapse, 
although the risk for these seems greatest in women with preexisting pelvic support 
defects.40,41 It remains controversial whether hysterectomy has an adverse effect on sexual 
function.42 However, for BRCA1+ women undergoing premenopausal RRSO, the most 
important factor affecting sexual function, irrespective of uterine management, is almost 
certainly the induction of surgical menopause. Last, mortality due to hysterectomy is very 
rare and much lower than would be expected for serous uterine cancer in this cohort, having 
been reported as 0.03% to 0.06% in 3 population-based studies from Finland, the United 
Kingdom, and Australia, which together reported on more than 126 000 hysterectomies 
performed for nonmalignant indications.43–45
Given the similar surgical risks, very low mortality, acceptable costs, and potential 
protection against serous-like endometrial cancer, if the present results are confirmed by 
future studies, hysterectomy with bilateral salpingo-oophorectomy may become the 
preferred risk-reducing surgical approach for BRCA1+ women. However, even if these 
results are confirmed, RRSO alone may still have a role for BRCA1+ women if strong 
reasons exist for uterine retention, such as dense pelvic adhesions or desire for future 
pregnancy using assisted reproductive approaches. For BRCA1+ women who have already 
undergone RRSO, the optimal approach is less clear. Whether a 25-year risk for serous/
serous-like uterine cancer of 2.6% to 4.7% justifies the risks and costs of a second surgery 
will need to be addressed by future prospective studies.
CONCLUSIONS
Our results suggest that BRCA1+ women are at increased risk for serous/serous-like 
endometrial carcinoma. Although instability in the estimated magnitude of this risk remains, 
we believe that the possibility of this cancer should be considered when discussing the 
advantages and risks of hysterectomy at the time of RRSO in BRCA1+ women.

 Figure 1. Immunohistochemical (IHC) evaluation of BRCA1 protein expression for uterine 
corpus cancers that developed during follow-up
Patient A – Serous-like Carcinoma: IHC evaluation shows loss of BRCA1 protein 
expression in tumor cell nuclei compared to an intact internal control (tumor infiltrating 
lymphocytes). Patient B – Serous-like Carcinoma: IHC again demonstrates loss of 
BRCA1 protein expression in tumor cell nuclei compared to an intact internal control 
(perivascular smooth muscle). Patient C – Serous-like Carcinoma: IHC demonstrates lack 
of staining in tumor cell nuclei compared to an intact internal control (endometrial stroma). 
Patient D - Leiomyosarcoma: IHC shows retention of BRCA1 protein expression.
