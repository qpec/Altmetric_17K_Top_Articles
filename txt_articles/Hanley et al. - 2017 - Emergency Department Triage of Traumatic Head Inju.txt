 efficacy of an automated classification algorithm to determine the likelihood of being computed tomography (CT)
positive, in high-functioning TBI patients in the acute state.
Methods: Adult patients admitted to the ED for evaluation within 72 hours of sustaining a closed head injury with
GCS 12 to 15 were candidates for study. A total of 720 patients (18–85 years) meeting inclusion/exclusion criteria
were enrolled in this observational, prospective validation trial, at 11 U.S. EDs. GCS was 15 in 97%, with the first and
third quartiles being 15 (interquartile range = 0) in the study population at the time of the evaluation. Standard clinical
evaluations were conducted and 5 to 10 minutes of electroencephalogram (EEG) was acquired from frontal and
frontal–temporal scalp locations. Using an a priori derived EEG-based classification algorithm developed on an
independent population and applied to this validation population prospectively, the likelihood of each subject being
CT+ was determined, and performance metrics were computed relative to adjudicated CT findings.
Results: Sensitivity of the binary classifier (likely CT+ or CT–) was 92.3% (95% confidence interval [CI] = 87.8%–
95.5%) for detection of any intracranial injury visible on CT (CT+), with specificity of 51.6% (95% CI = 48.1%–
55.1%) and negative predictive value (NPV) of 96.0% (95% CI = 93.2%–97.9%). Using ternary classification (likely
CT+, equivocal, likely CT–) demonstrated enhanced sensitivity to traumatic hematomas (≥1 mL of blood), 98.6%
(95%
CI = 92.6%–100.0%), and NPV of 98.2% (95% CI = 95.5%–99.5%).
Conclusion: Using an EEG-based biomarker high accuracy of predicting the likelihood of being CT+ was
obtained, with high NPV and sensitivity to any traumatic bleeding and to hematomas. Specificity was significantly
higher than standard CT decision rules. The short time to acquire results and the ease of use in the ED
environment suggests that EEG-based classifier algorithms have potential to impact triage and clinical
management of head-injured patients.
T
he Centers for Disease Control and Prevention
estimates
that
traumatic
brain
injury
(TBI)
accounts for over 2.5 million emergency department
(ED) visits annually in the United States.1 ED visits
for TBI have increased by 29.1% over the period from
2006 to 2010, a time when ED visits overall increased
only 3.6%.2 Not included are another 1.6 to 3.8 mil-
lion annually who sustain sports related TBI and do
not seek emergency medical care3 and TBI in the mili-
tary. TBI treatment is time-sensitive, and early identifi-
cation
is
associated
with
reduced
morbidity
and
improved outcomes.4 Robust, quantitative tools for
screening do not currently exist in practice. Nonethe-
less, the rapid, objective, and accurate identification
and triage of head-injured persons with such a tool
could significantly contribute to improved care and
outcome.
Currently, computed tomography (CT) scan is the
pragmatically accepted criterion standard for identify-
ing acute intracranial injuries in the ED, although the
vast majority of those with mild TBI (mTBI), esti-
mated to be as high as 90%, are found to be negative
for clinically important brain injury.5–7 Yet many of
these patients eventually experience substantial impair-
ment which is underdiagnosed in the ED setting.
Clinical decision rules (e.g., New Orleans Criteria
[NOC],8 Canadian CT Head Rule [CCHR]6,9) cur-
rently focus on CT scanning and have high sensitivity
at the expense of very low specificity,10–12 contributing
to potential long-term health risks associated with over-
scanning.10,13 Care pathways that reduce the radiation
exposure risks and allow for screening of mTBI
patients in nonhospital settings could provide substan-
tial benefit to mTBI patients.
Previous studies of traumatic hematomas in mild to
moderate head-injured populations, suggest extremely
high sensitivity to CT-positive (CT+) cases with mea-
surable blood, using a classification algorithm based
on brain electrical activity.14,15 In studies comparing
brain electrical activity classifiers for TBI with standard
practice decision rules for CT in the ED, an electroen-
cephalogram (EEG) marker was reported to have speci-
ficity and negative predictive value (NPV) greatly
exceeding those of the standard decision rules, while
maintaining equivalent sensitivity.16,17
The present, observational, multisite, prospective,
clinical trial evaluated the feasibility of using this tech-
nology on a handheld device with a disposable headset,
at the point of care. It was hypothesized that the classi-
fier algorithm would detect with high accuracy, the likeli-
hood of the patient having a brain injury visible on CT
scan (CT+). Coprimary endpoints to test this hypothe-
sis were sensitivity and specificity of the algorithm. Since
binary classification does not take into account informa-
tion related to the patients distance from the threshold,
a three-tier (ternary) classification output was also

 studied to test the hypothesis that ternary classification
would improve accuracy and clinical utility.
METHODS
Study Design and Setting
Following
local
institutional
review
board
(IRB)
approval, this trial included a prospective convenience
sample of adult patients presenting to one of the 11
participating U.S. ED sites (Allegheny General Hospi-
tal, Pittsburgh, PA; Baylor University Medical Center,
Dallas, TX; Detroit Receiving Hospital, Detroit, MI;
Emory University School of Medicine and Grady
Memorial Hospital, Atlanta, GA; Hartford Hospital,
Hartford, CT; R. Adams Cowley Shock Trauma Cen-
ter, Baltimore, MD; University of Rochester Medical
Center, Rochester, NY; University of Texas Memorial
Hermann Hospital, Houston, TX; University of Vir-
ginia Health System, Charlottesville, VA; Washington
University Barnes Jewish Medical Center, St. Louis,
MO; Wayne State University Sinai-Grace Hospital,
Detroit, MI) following a closed head injury between
February and December 2015. Screening occurred in
the ED. Subjects were referred for CT scans by the
emergency physician in accordance with standard clini-
cal practice. The trial stopping point was event driven
and required a minimum of 138 CT+ events. The
ratio of CT+ to CT-negative (CT–) was monitored to
assure thorough screening of potential subjects. All
study subjects met the inclusion/exclusion criteria
described below, provided either signed informed writ-
ten consent or written consent was obtained by proxy
(63 cases). The trial (Validation of TBI Detection Sys-
tem for Head Injured Patients [B-AHEAD III]) was
registered on ClinicalTrials.gov (NCT02367300; June
17, 2016).
Study Population
The target population consisted of patients with high
neurologic
function
following
closed
head
injury,
while in the acute state. Thus, patients between the
ages of 18 and 85 years who presented to an ED
within 72 hours of suffering head injury, with Glas-
gow Coma Scale (GCS) of 12 to 15 (at time closest to
evaluation by the Ahead 300 device, BrainScope),
were candidates for study. Patients were excluded if
scalp/skull abnormalities precluded placement of the
electrodes on the forehead or if they had advanced
dementia,
Parkinson’s
disease,
multiple
sclerosis,
known seizure or other central nervous system disor-
ders, history of brain tumors, brain surgery, stroke, or
evidence of acute psychosis or current substance
dependence. In addition, patients with end-stage renal
disorder, those requiring airway management, or those
receiving procedural sedation at the time of the evalua-
tion were also excluded.
Study Protocol
Clinical Assessments.
Subjects were evaluated
in the ED using standard practice clinical procedures
for each site and its physicians. Evaluations also
included the Standardized Assessment of Concussion
scale18,19 and the Concussion Symptom Inventory.20
While not meant to provide immediate decisions with
regard to severity of injury or need for CT scan, these
measures were collected only to characterize the symp-
toms upon presentation to the ED. The NOC and
CCHR were computed centrally for study purposes,
but were not provided to the clinician nor required
during the management process. The use of decision
support tools independently by the clinician was nei-
ther mandated nor recorded.
EEG Data Acquisition.
Five to 10 minutes of eyes
closed resting EEG data was recorded using a Brain-
Scope Ahead 300 device and disposable self-adhesive
headset. The headset was used to place electrodes on
the standard frontal locations of the expanded Interna-
tional 10/20 system, including FP1, FP2, AFz, F7, and
F8. All electrode impedances were below 10 kΩ. Ampli-
fiers had a band pass filter from 0.3 to 250 Hz (3 dB
points). Data quality was assessed at time of acquisition
by artifact algorithms embedded in the device, used to
identify and remove any biologic and nonbiologic con-
tamination (e.g., lateral and horizontal eye movement,
external electrical noise) and quality was confirmed
using additional offline algorithm.21

Development of algo-
rithms applied in the validation trial.
The
patients evaluated in this validation trial were an inde-
pendent population distinct from the sample used to
develop the classification algorithm. The database used
for algorithm development was constructed through
multiple studies across several years of development,
under consistent protocols. Study sites included 20
EDs and 11 colleges and high schools across the Uni-
ted States, with approval from local IRBs. Subjects
ACADEMIC EMERGENCY MEDICINE • May 2017, Vol. 24, No. 5 • www.aemj.org
619
 were a convenience sample (n = 2,407; 36% female,
64% male). Of these subjects 29.1% were controls
and 70.9% were TBI patients. TBI patients included
males and females between the ages of 15 and 92,
who suffered a closed head injury and with a GCS of
8 or higher. The mean GCS of the cohort was 14.9
(median = 15, standard deviation [SD] � 0.4, range =
9–15). The mean age of the cohort was 39.5 (me-
dian = 36.2, SD � 17.6, range = 15.1–91.7) years.
All subjects either provided signed informed written
consent or written consent was obtained by proxy.
Importantly, while similar in demographics and clini-
cal criteria for inclusion, the validation population
reported on herein was totally independent of these
algorithm development subjects. The details of the
data processing approach and sensitivity to detection
obtained using this methodology are discussed in pub-
lished literature14,15,22 and is briefly reviewed below.
Structural injury classifier. The binary discriminant
classification algorithm applied in this study was
derived using a Least Absolute Shrinkage and Selec-
tion Operator methodology, which uses a regularized
logistic regression model23 and consists of a weighted
combination of selected linear and nonlinear EEG fea-
tures and selected clinical features that optimally distin-
guish patients with traumatic structural brain injury
visible on CT scan from normal or concussed patients
(CT–). This algorithm was then applied prospectively
to the validation trial patient population.
The final inputs to the classifier function included
EEG and clinical variables. Quantitative EEG (QEEG)
features with the highest weights, contributing the
most to the classifier function, included: 1) scale-free
measures of the total power spectra across regions
(especially
involving
the
frontotemporal
regions);
2) features reflecting shifts in the frequency spectrum
(especially involving the alpha band); and 3) features
reflecting disruption in connectivity between regions
(especially phase but also coherence). Clinical signs
and symptoms believed to be manifestations of the
physiologic changes caused by TBI, or risk factors for
TBI, also contributed to the classification algorithm,
with highest weights for LOC and age.
Derivation of the ternary classification threshold.
The ternary classification output was determined using
the same development data set as used for the binary
(CT+, CT–) analysis, implementing a second thresh-
old (T2) that, together with the binary threshold (T1),
define an equivocal zone as a third classification
category.
The binary threshold (T1) was derived from algorithm
development receiver operating characteristic (ROC)
curves, based on discriminant scores for the structural
injury classifier function. The distribution of all discrimi-
nant scores for the total development population of sub-
jects was used to establish the mean and SD. A
conservative interval was specified based on 0.25 times
the SD from this population resulting in a second lower
threshold (T2) to allow discriminant scores between T1
and T2 to be classified in an equivocal zone. In this way,
the normal variance of discriminant scores in the head-
injured and non–head-injured population was used to
define an expected variance near T1, thus allowing those
scores within the range between T1 and T2 to be consid-
ered equivocal. The interval of 0.25 9 SD was chosen to
limit the percentage of subjects in the interval to less than
10%. In the algorithm development validation popula-
tion 7% of the patients were found to lie between T2 and
T1. These two threshold cut points were applied in an a
priori manner to the test population to discriminate
CT+ from CT–.
Analysis of trial data.
All EEG data processing
was completed offline to maintain data acquisition
blind to the clinical presentation and to blind the clas-
sification results at the clinical site. It is important to
note that since the classification algorithm was final-
ized a priori, only those specific features used in the
algorithm were extracted from the independent valida-
tion population as part of the algorithm calculation
used to classify each subject’s EEG.
CT Adjudication for Clinical Truth
In all cases the determination to receive a CT scan
was made by the site ED physician, according to stan-
dard of care. The centrally adjudicated results of the
routine CT served as the pragmatic reference standard.
CT scans, as DICOM images, were deidentified and
transferred for adjudication independent of the test
EEG data results. A positive finding was prospectively
defined as an adjudicated core laboratory reading of a
subject’s clinical CT with the determination of the
presence of intracranial blood. To address the poten-
tial differences between neuroradiologic reads of the
CT scans across sites, adjudication of clinical truth fol-
lowed a rigorous and quantitative procedure involving
sequential evaluation by imaging specialists and physi-
cian specialist readers with image-based initial indepen-
dent
determination
of
CT+
or
CT–
and
then
adjudication of discrepant readings and adjudicated
620

 unanimity for final determinations as the ultimate gold
standard for image-based truth. Additionally, blood
volume measurement was determined using OsiriX
(which included a human segmentation capability).24
A blood volume greater than or equal to 1 mL was
used as the threshold to identify a subset of patients
with well-formed hematomas that may represent a
greater clinical risk of injury. CT+ findings included
anatomic description of location such as subarachnoid
hemorrhage
(SAH),
subdural,
epidural,
and/or
intracranial hematomas. Positive findings did not
include extracranial injuries (such as scalp lacerations/
foreign bodies, soft tissue swelling), facial injuries (frac-
tures, blood in sinuses), and nontraumatic abnormi-
ties (such as sinusitis). If the patient received more
than one CT scan during their ED evaluation, the
scan closest in time to the Ahead 300 evaluation was
adjudicated to determine clinical truth.
Since site IRBs would not allow CT scans in subjects
where it was not determined to be clinically necessary,
and in keeping with multiple published guidelines for
reduction of unnecessary radiation exposure,25 these
patients were considered CT– only if the NOC was
applicable (that is, they had a GCS = 15 and LOC or
posttraumatic amnesia) but were negative for all NOC
symptoms (i.e., the NOC was negative) and if study fol-
low-up evaluations (at 72–96 hours postinjury) con-
firmed no exacerbation of symptoms or return for
further neuroimaging or treatment.22 This procedure
was applied in the Food and Drug Administration–
cleared Ahead 100/200 and Ahead 300 validation trials.
Data Analyses
Planned Analyses.
The primary objective of this
study was to validate the clinical utility of the BrainScope
Ahead 300 device for the acute identification of struc-
tural brain injuries visible on CT in the TBI population,
following closed head injury. The coprimary endpoints
for this study were the sensitivity/specificity pair for iden-
tification of CT+ cases by the Ahead 300 classification
algorithm relative to adjudicated CT truth. A secondary
objective was to evaluate the clinical utility of creating a
system of classification into three tiers, likely CT+, equi-
vocal [require close observation], or likely CT�.
Power to Observe.
Power analyses for sensitivity
determined that with 80% power the number of CT+
patients required was 138 for a one-sided alpha of 0.05.
For the specificity at least 543 CT– subjects were needed
for a one-sided alpha of 0.05. If either the criterion
standard or the study test where found to be of indeter-
minate status on blind review of test quality they were
eliminated from the analysis; thus the paired data set
had no missing data. All data analyses were performed
by an independent biostatistician. Data acquisition and
compliance to the protocol was independently moni-
tored by a Contract Research Organization (Brain Injury
Outcomes [BIOS] Division, Johns Hopkins University).
The data were analyzed in accordance with a prespeci-
fied statistical report and analysis plan prepared by the
independent biostatistician prior to conduction of the
study, to yield multiplicity-adjusted test statistics for pri-
mary and secondary endpoints. The analyses were done
with StatXact Version 8 or later. Creation of analysis
data sets was done with SAS version 9.2 or later.
Role of the Funding Sources.
The funding
source worked with clinical sites to develop the protocol
to address the endpoints of the U.S. Army–funded con-
tract. The final protocol was approved by each site’s
IRB and the U.S. Army Human Research Protection
Office prior to study activation. BrainScope supported
data collection by research contracts to the clinical sites
and provided training in use of the Ahead device and
data acquisition. Funding supported engagement of an
independent CRO (BIOS, Johns Hopkins) who seques-
tered all data throughout the study, keeping BrainScope
blinded to the reference data, with the exception of one
clinical coordinator who worked closely with the CRO
and clinical sites but remained blinded to the Ahead
data. The corresponding author, LSP, was blinded to
the data until after the independent statistician (RPC)
completed all analyses of primary and secondary end-
points and worked with clinical site co-authors in the
writing of the report and in interpretation of the data.

Of the 720 subjects, 156 were CT+ and 564 were
CT–. Of the 564 CT– subjects, 155 (27%) did not
have a CT ordered under standard practice guidelines
and were deemed CT– for purpose of analyses

 according to the procedure described in detail above.
Thus, the determination of CT– included a follow-up
(phone within 72–96 hours or 30-day medical record
review) as verification that a subject released from the
ED did not have a structural injury that either evolved
or was initially missed. A total of 37.5% of subjects
were hospitalized for observation, 8.2% were admitted
to an ED observation unit, while 54.3% were released
from the ED to return home. One subject required
neurosurgical intervention for a depressed temporal
bone fracture; this subject was identified indepen-
dently as CT+ by both the core CT laboratory and
the test device.
Table 1 presents the characteristics of the CT–
and CT+ populations of patients. Significant differ-
ences were found for age, with the CT+ population
having
a
higher
mean
age,
likely
reflecting
the
increased vulnerability/susceptibility to TBI following
head injury in the elderly population. GCS also
showed
a
significant
difference
between
groups.
However, with the small range of values, identical
medians, a very small SD, and the first and third
quartiles being 15 (IQR = 0), this difference is con-
sidered
to
be
not
clinically
meaningful.

shows the mechanisms of injury, with the largest
percentage of both populations coming from motor
vehicle accidents and falls.
Other Information.
There were one adverse event
(burning sensation on forehead) and five serious
adverse events (readmission to the hospital) reported
during the trial. All serious adverse events were unre-
lated to the device or the subject’s participation in the
trial.

 specificity was demonstrated to scale with severity of
clinical functional impairment with specificities of
76.7, 58.8, and 22.2% for none, mild, and moderate
functional impairment, respectively. It is noted that
the scoring for severity of functional impairment was
performed retrospectively, in a blind manner, using an
algorithm that was based on the report of the presence
and severity of clinical signs and symptoms.
There were 12 false-negative (FN) classifications
resulting in a FN rate of 7.7%. Further, eight of these
12 patients were classified in the equivocal zone in the
ternary classification, indicating that these patients
were close to the threshold for the binary classifica-
tion, therefore suggesting need for further observation
or evaluation of this group, lowering the false-positive
rate (classified as clearly negative) to 2.5%. None of
the FNs required surgery or returned to the hospital
for exacerbation of symptoms or additional neuroimag-
ing. Detailed study of the clinical/medical characteris-
tics of the FNs revealed that all had GCS = 15, none
had any focal neurologic signs, six reported LOC,
none of the patients had an epidural hematoma
(EDH), and half of the CT+ findings included SAH
(alone or with a small hematoma). No relationship to
specific locations of the CT findings were found in
this FN group. Further, a wide age range and time of
evaluation relative time of injury suggested that neither
were contributing factors.
Using the prevalence of CT+ in this study (21.7%,
156/720), NPV was found to be 96.0% (93.2%, 97.9)
and PPV was found to be 34.5% (30.0%, 39.3%). It
is noted that the literature supports a prevalence rate
for equivalent, general populations to be approximately
10%;22 thus NPV and PPV was also computed at this
prevalence rate where NPV was 98.4% and PPV was
17.5%.
The ROC curve for performance of the structural
injury classifier in this independent, validation popula-
tion had an area under the ROC curve (AUC) of
0.82 and is shown in Figure 2. The circle on the

 studies. Classifications in this independent validation
trial were made relative to this a priori determined
threshold. It should be noted that the AUC for a clas-
sifier
using
only
clinical
features
as
inputs
was
0.75. Given that AUC ranges from 0.5 to 1.0, this is
a significant difference in AUC, representing a relative
increase of 28% in overall classifier performance using
the structural injury classifier (EEG plus clinical), sup-
porting the clinical value added of the core EEG fea-
tures in the classification algorithm.
It is noted that homogeneity across the 11 clinical
sites was tested for both sensitivity and specificity.
There was little evidence of lack of homogeneity across
sites (p = 0.5718 for sensitivity and p = 0.3858 for
specificity), justifying the pooling of data across sites.
Three-tier Classifications
Combining positive classification and equivocal classifi-
cation, sensitivity becomes 97.4% (152/156, 95% confi-
dence
interval
[CI] = 93.6%–99.3%);
specificity
becomes 38.7% (281/564, 95% CI = 34.6%–42.8%);
NPV becomes 98.2% (218/222, 95% CI = 95.5%–
99.5%); and PPV becomes 30.5% (152/498, 95%
CI = 26.5%–34.8%). Note that combining the CT–
and the equivocal zone generates the same results as
shown above for the binary classifier (see Table 3), as
the second threshold (T2) was below the binary thresh-
old (T1) of the classifier. The second threshold (T2) is
shown as a triangle on the ROC curve seen in Figure 2.
Additional Diagnostic Efficacy
Seventy-three of the CT+ patients were found to have
measurable blood > 1 mL shown on CT DICOM
images (including SAH, EDH, subdural hematoma
[SDH], and intracranial hematoma [ICH] traumatic
hemorrhages), representing 46.8% of the total CT+
population. The sensitivity of the binary classifier to
this subgroup was 93.2% (67/73, 95% CI = 87.8%–
95.5%) for the binary classification and 98.6% (72/
73, 95% CI = 92.6%–100.0%) for the three-tier classi-
fication. The CIs for this endpoint are not adjusted.
DISCUSSION
This multisite validation study demonstrated that a
hand-held, noninvasive, easy-to-use device can objec-
tively assess TBI in the ED with 92.3% sensitivity,
51.6% specificity, and 96.0% NPV, in an independent
test population of 720 mild-moderate head-injured
patients, using a classification algorithm derived from
Figure 2. ROC curve for performance of the classifier in the independent validation population. The ROC curve shows the a priori deter-
mined threshold (T1, circle) for binary classification and the second threshold (T2, triangle) used to define the establishing the equivocal zone
for ternary classification. The AUC for this ROC is 0.82. AUC = area under the ROC curve; ROC = receiver operating characteristic. [Color

Hanley et al. • ED TRIAGE OF TBI USING A BRAIN ELECTRICAL ACTIVITY BIOMARKER
 a large, independently acquired population of head-
injured patients seen in the EDs across the country.
CT+ cases were independently adjudicated to establish
clinical truth and included any structural intracranial
brain injury as visible on CT scan (including SAH,
SDH, EDH, ICH, and combinations of these). The
importance of validating the algorithm in the acute
state (within 72 hours of injury), in a population who
presents with mild neurologic impairment (97% with
GCS = 15), supports the potential impact of the
methodology in those patients where triage is often dif-
ficult, yet time of clinical course of utmost importance.
Binary classification suffers from the fact that the dis-
tance of the subject from the threshold is not taken into
consideration. Incorporation of an “equivocal zone”
indicating when a classification is near the threshold,
that is, higher than normal, but not high enough to be
considered positive (e.g., “prehypertension,” “predia-
betes”), was added and the clinical utility assessed rela-
tive to the binary classification results. Higher sensitivity
(97.4%) was obtained for three-tier classification of
likely CT+, likely CT–, or equivocal, when equivocal is
treated as a positive result. Sensitivity to the subset of
traumatic hematomas with ≥1 mL of blood was 93.2
(binary) and 98.6% (ternary), demonstrating substantial
sensitivity to traumatic brain injuries where risk related
to FNs is highest. It is also important to note that the
accuracy of identification of hematomas was not related
to distance from recording electrodes (data not shown)
and was obtained for bleeds at a reliably detectable vol-
ume (≥1 mL). Since FNs were of highest concern, it is
noted that the small number of FNs did not include
any patients who required neurosurgery. Study results
demonstrate the enhanced sensitivity performance of
the three-zone classification, providing additional clini-
cally important information about subjects whose classi-
fication is close to the binary threshold, thereby
identifying a group of patients who might require fur-
ther observation.
These high levels of sensitivity were obtained along
with overall specificities of 51.6% (with binary classifi-
cation) and 38.7% (with three zones). Specificity was
also found to be inversely related to degree of func-
tional impairment reported. The highest specificity
(76.7%) was reported in those with little to no func-
tional impairment. The specificity of NOC applied to
this study population was found to be 8.6%, similar
to that reported in the literature11 and manyfold lower
than the 51.6% specificity obtained in this study, with
approximately
equivalent
sensitivity.
Applying
the
CCHR,9 another standard decision rule for such pop-
ulation, specificity of 31% was obtained, while higher
than the NOC, is still significantly below that of the
Ahead 300 validation results. It is noted that these
reduced specificities were obtained with approximately
equivalent sensitivity to that obtained with the Ahead
300 classification algorithm, with 97 and 94%, respec-
tively, for the NOC and the CCHR.
Negative predictive value of 96% (for binary classifi-
cation) and 98.2% (for ternary classification) reported
in this trial can increase confidence in the clinical deci-
sion path in patients with minor or no possibly aiding
in the reduction of overscanning. Likewise, a positive
finding could result in scanning a patient with a very
mild presentation but who might have a structural
injury.26 This technology is not meant to replace the
CT scan in patients with head injury, but provides the
clinician with additional information to facilitate rou-
tine clinical decision making. Demonstrations of real-
world sensitivity in epidemiologic data sets will eventu-
ally inform the precise level of sensitivity for CT+,
which would best inform utilization in practice.27–30
LIMITATIONS
The study was limited to an adult population; further
studies are under way to expand into the pediatric
population. The total number of individuals and brain
lesions is still small compared to the yearly number of
traumatic lesions. Estimates from a well-designed epi-
demiologic evaluation will give even more robust mea-
sures
of
sensitivity
and
specificity.
Perhaps
such
estimates will be useful for long-term public health
purposes. Additionally, clinical sites did not include
urgent care facilities where such capabilities could be
clinically important. All analyses in this study were
conducted offline. Future studies need to explore miti-
gation of conditions that may interfere with data qual-
ity under “clinical use” versus the “research setting.”
Future studies are needed to further evaluate the
impact of physicians using such data in real-time acute
evaluation of mTBI patients.
CONCLUSIONS
Using an algorithm based on quantitative brain electrical
activity has been shown to have potential as a biomarker
of traumatic structural brain injury, with high sensitivity
and high negative predictive value for acute traumatic
bleeding on computed tomography scan. This algorithm

 based on advanced signal processing methods and
machine learning technology demonstrated enhanced
clinical utility of electroencephalogram, well beyond that
of conventional methods. The short time to acquire
results and the ease of use in the ED suggest utilization
of this type of device in other urgent care environments,
at “field” or other underresourced areas, as an adjunct to
traumatic brain injury assessment where imaging is
unavailable. In summary, objective devices with clinically
meaningful sensitivity, specificity, and negative predictive
value could substantially alter the landscape of mild trau-
matic brain injury management as an adjunct to the clin-
ical diagnostic pathways, to assist in diagnosis of
bleeding and of nonbleeding brain injuries.
