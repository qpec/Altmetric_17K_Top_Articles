Layer-specific modulation of
neocortical dendritic inhibition
during active wakefulness
William Muñoz,1* Robin Tremblay,1* Daniel Levenstein,1,2 Bernardo Rudy1,3†
g-Aminobutyric acid (GABA)ergic inputs are strategically positioned to gate synaptic
integration along the dendritic arbor of pyramidal cells. However, their spatiotemporal
dynamics during behavior are poorly understood. Using an optical-tagging
electrophysiological approach to record and label somatostatin-expressing (Sst)
interneurons (GABAergic neurons specialized for dendritic inhibition), we discovered a
layer-specific modulation of their activity in behaving mice. Sst interneuron subtypes,
residing in different cortical layers and innervating complementary laminar domains,
exhibited opposite activity changes during transitions to active wakefulness. The relative
weight of vasoactive intestinal peptide–expressing (Vip) interneuron–mediated
inhibition of distinct Sst interneurons and cholinergic modulation determined their in vivo
activity. These results reveal a state-dependent laminar influence of Sst interneuron–
mediated inhibition, with implications for the compartmentalized regulation of dendritic
signaling in the mammalian neocortex.
D
endrites are specialized compartments for
the reception, processing, and storage of
the majority of incoming synaptic inputs
(1). At the subcellular level, somatostatin-
expressing (Sst) interneuron inhibitory syn-
apsesplacedalongthedendritictreeof apyramidal
neuron can veto synaptic integration (2) and Ca2+
electrogenesis (3, 4) with fine spatiotemporal
specificity (5). Recent studies in several neocor-
tical areas have highlighted the participation of
superficial layer 2/3 (L2/3) Sst interneurons in a
canonical disinhibitory circuit supporting con-
text-dependent sensory processing, in which the
activity of L2/3 Sst interneurons is suppressed by
the action of interneuron-selective vasoactive intes-
tinal peptide–expressing (Vip) interneurons (6).
Removing dendritic inhibition facilitates the gen-
eration of Ca2+ spikes and burst firing of pyram-
idal neurons (7), thereby modulating the gain of
their responses as a key mechanism for sensori-
motor integration (7–9), reinforcement encoding
(10), and selective attention (11). However, the
focus on superficial L2/3 Sst interneuron cir-
cuits in vivo, which minimally target the main
input and output excitatory cells in L4 and L5/6,
respectively, reflects technical limitations in
accessing Sst interneurons situated deeper in
the cortex, comprising both the most diverse
(12–14) as well as the majority of this class of
interneuron (6, 15, 16).
To investigate the contribution of the Sst in-
terneuron population to dendritic inhibitory action
during behavior, we used channelrhodopsin-
assisted patching (14). This method gives access
to the activity and morphology of targeted cells at
any brain depth (Fig. 1A). Using this strategy in
awake SstCre mice (17) crossed to a reporter line
that conditionally expresses channelrhodopsin-2
(ChR2)–enhanced yellow fluorescent protein (EYFP)
(18), we recorded and labeled light-responsive Sst
interneurons throughout all layers of the somato-
sensory barrel cortex (Fig. 1, A and B). To directly
relate Sst interneuron activity to behavioral state,
we monitored quiescence and whisking periods
with whisker pad electromyogram (EMG) record-
ings, as well as local field potentials (LFPs) at the
cortical recording site (Fig. 1A and fig. S1). Our
data set consisted of 91 Sst interneurons, 50 of
which were labeled and histologically analyzed
(Fig. 1 and figs. S2 and S3). The laminar distri-
bution of recorded Sst interneurons was similar to
the observed distribution of immunopositive Sst
neurons throughout the cortical column (Fig. 1B).
In this data set, 86% of the recorded Sst inter-
neurons exhibited significant activity modulation
during whisking epochs (Fig. 1, C to F, and fig. S4).
Whisking behavioral states were accompanied by
transitions to neocortical network activation (as
defined by decreased power of low frequencies
and increased power of high frequencies in the
LFP, fig. S1).
Spiking activity of all L2/3 Sst interneurons
was suppressed (WhOFF) during whisking [Fig. 1,
C and E to F; (7–9)]. In contrast, all modulated L4
Sst interneurons strongly increased their spiking
activity (WhON) during whisking (Fig. 1, D to F).
In infragranular layers, activity was heterogeneous.
WhOFF Sst interneurons were enriched in L5a,
whereas the majority of the Sst interneurons in
layers 5b to 6 were WhON (Fig. 1, E and F). WhON
and WhOFF activity profiles were associated with
similar whisking behavioral parameters (i.e.,
duration and interwhisking intervals) and LFP
frequency–power representations, suggesting that
these findings are not due to preparation differ-
ences (i.e., different levels of arousal between ani-
mals; fig. S1).
Sst interneurons in different cortical layers have
been associated with distinct axonal distribu-
tions (12, 13). We hypothesized that the laminar
distribution of WhON and WhOFF activity profiles
reflected specific Sst interneuron subtypes. Thus,
we analyzed the axonal projection patterns of a
subset of the cells that were functionally charac-
terized and labeled in vivo (n = 39 cells identified
morphologically by serial-section confocal imag-
ing, of which 22 were digitally reconstructed; Fig.
2 and fig. S5). This analysis revealed five distinct
morphological subtypes (fig. S5). WhONand WhOFF
activity patterns were exclusively represented by
specific subtypes, biased to cortical layers that
were consistent with the laminar distribution
of whisking-related activity profiles (Fig. 2 and figs.
S5 and S6). L2/3 Sst interneurons were prototyp-
ical Martinotti cells with ascending axonal projec-
tions extensively innervating L1 to L3 (Fig. 2A),
where they inhibitthe dendrites of L2/3 pyramidal
cells but target only weakly and with low proba-
bility L5 pyramidal cells (19, 20). In contrast, L4 Sst
interneurons,designatedasnon-Martinottibecause
of the lack of significant L1 innervation, had axons
restricted to L4 (Fig. 2B), where they preferentially
inhibit local parvalbumin-expressing (Pvalb) inter-
neurons in vitro (13). Because L2/3 Martinotti cells
are exclusively WhOFF and L4 non-Martinotti cells
are WhON (Fig. 2, A and B) and they selectively
target L2/3 pyramidal cells and L4 Pvalb interneur-
ons, respectively, the impact of their activity is
predicted to result in layer-specific disinhibition
during whisking (fig. S7).
Infragranular Sst interneurons with different
whisking-related activity profiles were intermingled,
with somatic localization biases of WhOFF cells to
L5a and WhON cells to layers 5b to 6 (Fig. 1, E and
F). This intermingled distribution comprised dis-
tinct Sst interneuron subtypes with complemen-
tary, minimally overlapping axonal domains, which
also acted in stereotypical WhON or WhOFF fashion
(Fig. 2, C to F, and fig. S5). In particular, infragran-
ular WhOFF Sst interneurons in L5a and L5b were
Martinotti cells with local axonal plexus in L5a and
translaminar axons restricted to the uppermost part
ofL1(designated“T-shaped”becauseofaxoncharac-
teristics, Fig. 2D and fig. S5). In contrast, infragra-
nular WhON Martinotti Sst interneuron axons were
more broadly distributed to lower L1 and L2/3 (de-
signated “fanning-out” because of axon character-
istics, Fig. 2E). Their cell bodies and local axonal
domains were also located deeper than those of in-
fragranular L5a and L5b WhOFF Martinotti cells
(Fig. 2, C to E, and fig. S5). The remaining subset of
infragranular L5a and L5b WhON Sst interneurons

 werenon-Martinotticells,withsomaticlocalization
and local axon plexus in L5b and L5b/6 and
substantial innervation of L3 and L4 (Fig. 2F
and fig. S5). Although the efferent connectivity
of L5/6 non-Martinotti cells has not been explored,
infragranular Sst Martinotti cells potently inhibit
L5 pyramidal neurons (20, 21). Because of the
differences and complementarity in targeting
domains of infragranular Sst WhON and WhOFF
Martinotti subtypes, a spatial rerouting of inhi-
bition onto L5 pyramidal cells occurs during
whisking, with increased inhibition on dendritic
segments localized in L2/3 (i.e., apical and oblique
dendrites) and withdrawal of inhibition on their
distal tufts in the superficial part of L1. These
inhibitory and disinhibitory effects predict an
interplay with the laminar organization of exci-
tatory inputs along compartments of the elabo-
rate dendritic arbors of L5 pyramidal neurons
(fig. S7).
What mechanisms contribute to the activ-
ity of distinct Sst interneurons during whisk-
ing? Vip interneurons play a crucial role in
silencing L2/3 Sst interneurons (22) during
active behavioral states (8–10). Our finding
that the majority of granular and infragranu-
lar Sst interneurons are WhON appears to be at
odds with the operations of this canonical cir-
cuit. However, the strength of Vip interneuron–
mediated inhibition has not been systematically
evaluated across Sst interneurons of different
layers or subtypes. Given that Vip interneuron
axonal innervation peaks in L2/3 and L5a (23),
we reasoned that differential Vip interneuron
inhibitory inputs to Sst interneurons across lay-
ers could play a key role in the laminar dis-
tribution of whisking activity profiles in vivo.
We therefore conditionally expressed ChR2 in
Vip interneurons and performed voltage-clamp
recordings of light-evoked inhibitory postsyn-
aptic charges onto mCherry-expressing Sst in-
terneurons in cortical slices from VipCre;Sst Flp
double-transgenic mice (Fig. 3, A and B, and
fig. S8). We found stronger synaptic inputs from
Vip interneurons onto L2/3 Sst interneurons
than onto L4 to L6 Sst interneurons (Fig. 3B,
left). The only infragranular Sst interneurons
that received strong Vip interneuron inputs were
located in L5a, matching the laminar-localization
bias observed for infragranular WhOFF Sst in-
terneurons. Indeed, a direct comparison of Vip
interneuron–mediated inhibition on infragran-
ular Sst interneuron subtypes yielded signifi-
cantly larger light-evoked inhibitory postsynaptic
charges onto T-shaped Martinotti interneurons
(associated with WhOFF activity in vivo), as com-
pared to fanning-out Martinotti and non-Martinotti
cells (Fig. 3B, right). The differences in inhibitory
postsynaptic charge found across Sst interneuron
subtypes were strongly correlated with the num-
ber of appositions from Vip interneurons, identi-
fied using vesicular GABA transporter (VGAT)
colocalization as a marker for GABAergic termi-
nals in ChR2-EYFP-expressing Vip interneuron
axons apposed to recorded Sst interneurons (fig.
S9). Moreover, the distribution of Vip interneuron
appositions onto L2/3 and T-shaped Martinotti
cells peaked at the soma, as compared to the
more distal distribution on fanning-out Martinotti
and non-Martinotti cells (25 to 50 mm from soma,
fig. S9).
We next tested whether Vip interneuron–
mediated inhibition of L2/3 and T-shaped Martinotti
cells contributed to their WhOFF activity pattern
in vivo. To this end, we conditionally expressed
PSAML141F-GlyR in Vip interneurons, a pharma-
cogenetic actuator that effectively dampens the
excitability of these interneurons upon application

 of its synthetic ligand PSEM308 [fig. S8 (24)].
We also conditionally expressed ChR2 in GABAergic
neurons in these VipCre;PSAML141F-GlyR mice, using
a viral vector in which ChR2 expression is under
the control of the mDlx enhancer (25). This en-
abled in vivo channelrhodopsin-assisted patch-
ing of Sst interneurons identified by functional
and histological methods (Fig. 3C and fig. S3).
Suppression of Vip interneuron activity in vivo
by local application of 0.5 mM PSEM308 re-
leased WhOFF Sst interneurons from this in-
hibitory source, converting their activity pattern
to the WhON phenotype (Fig. 3, C and D). How-
ever, this manipulation had no significant effect
on the activity profile of WhON Sst interneurons,
confirming their weaker inhibition by Vip in-
terneurons (Fig. 3D). These results establish a
causal link between Vip interneuron–mediated
inhibition and the WhOFF activity profile of Sst
interneurons.
What drives the activity of WhON Sst inter-
neurons during whisking? Excitatory afferents
to somatosensory cortex from the thalamus
(26–28) and primary motor cortex (29) are ac-
tive during whisking. However, Sst interneurons
receive only weak excitation from these sources
(8, 30). In addition, the activity modulation of
pyramidal cells in different layers is heteroge-
neous during whisking, and their overall laminar
trends are inconsistent with Sst interneurons
simply following their local network (31, 32). In
contrast, cholinergic activity in neocortex from
basal forebrain axons is associated with both
whisking and locomotion (33, 34), and Sst in-
terneurons are strongly depolarized by musca-
rinic receptor activation in vitro (13, 35–37). We
hypothesized that acetylcholine could be an im-
portant factor driving the activity of Sst inter-
neurons during whisking. Thus, we examined
the effect of pharmacologically blocking musca-
rinic receptors in vivo on the whisking activity
profiles of Sst interneurons. Local application
of atropine (0.5 to 1 mM) diminished, abolished,
or even reversed the activity modulation of WhON
Sst interneurons and further suppressed WhOFF
cells (Fig. 4, A and B). Acetylcholine has effects
on multiple neocortical cell types and synaps-
es (38). We next tested whether the in vivo cho-
linergic modulation of WhON Sst interneurons
is a cell-autonomous effect. To this end, we crossed
SstCre mice with Chrm1 flox/flox and Chrm3 flox/flox
mouse lines to generate mice for which both M1
and M3 muscarinic receptors were genetically
ablated specifically in Sst interneurons. The

 number and laminar distribution of neocortical
Sst interneurons in mutant mice and their intrinsic
electrophysiological properties were similar to
those in wild-type mice (fig. S10). Notably, in vitro
experiments confirmed that Sst interneurons
in mutant mice were insensitive to muscarine
(fig. S10). We next expressed ChR2 in Sst inter-
neurons in mutant mice to perform in vivo
channelrhodopsin-assistedpatching and recorded
a sample of muscarinic receptor–ablated Sst
interneurons in L2 to L6 (n = 17 cells). Under the
same awake conditions as those used in record-
ings of wild-type Sst interneurons, all but one
mutant Sst interneurons exhibited WhOFF activ-
ity profiles (Fig. 4, C to E). These mutant WhOFF
Sst interneurons were located in layers with ex-
pected predominance of WhON profiles (e.g., L4;
Fig. 4, D and E). Our results suggest that cho-
linergic modulation of Sst interneurons via M1
and/or M3 muscarinic receptors provides a major
excitatory drive to these cells during whisking
and is a key mediator of the WhON activity pro-
file. Together with our findings of differential
Vip interneuron–mediated inhibition to Sst in-
terneuron subtypes, we find evidence supporting
a push-pull mechanism in which inhibition
and cholinergic drive weigh differently on the
activity of WhON and WhOFF Sst subtypes during
whisking. In the context of our in vivo mani-
pulations, we are able to shift the balance be-
tween these two factors, exposing their underlying
influence and switching WhON and WhOFF activ-
ity profiles in distinct Sst interneuron subtypes.
Our results thus far reveal the existence of
functionally distinct Sst interneuron subtypes,
which are localized in specific layers, have spe-
cialized innervation patterns, and act in opposite
ways during whisking behavior. We next asked
whether the functional distinction between these
subtypes is also observed during quiescent or
nonwhisking states. Quiet wakefulness is associated
with prominent fluctuations in the power of the
delta (1 to 4 Hz) and gamma (40 to 100 Hz) fre-
quency bands of the neocortical LFP, which track
rhythmic shifts in the excitability of cortical net-
works (39–45). We thus analyzed the relation-
ship between the spiking of WhON and WhOFF
Sst interneurons and the power and phase of
these LFP frequency bands during nonwhisking
epochs. The spike rate of WhON Sst interneurons
was more strongly correlated with the power of
LFP delta-band activity than that of WhOFF Sst
interneurons (fig. S11). This behavior of WhON
Sst interneurons also contrasted with the weak
spike rate–delta power correlation of pyramidal
and Pvalb interneurons (fig. S11). Moreover, the
spiking of distinct Sst interneuron subtypes was
coupled to different phases of delta oscillatory
cycles (fig. S12A). In addition, Sst interneuron
spiking exhibited an orthogonal phase coupling
to gamma oscillatory cycles with respect to that
of pyramidal and Pvalb interneurons (fig. S12B).
Thus, we also find traces of the division of labor
between Sst interneuron subtypes during delta
oscillations, and a distinct profile of Sst inter-
neuron activity with gamma oscillations, as com-
pared to Pvalb or pyramidal neurons during
quiescent behavior.
Current understanding of the spatiotem-
poral action of neocortical dendritic inhibition
during behavior is limited. Multiple studies per-
formed in L2/3 from sensory and associative
neocortical areas have shown that Sst inter-
neurons are suppressed during whisking (7, 8),
locomotion (9), and different phases of learned
tasks (10). These findings implied that pyram-
idal dendrites are globally disinhibited during
active behavior. Here we report a layer-specific
modulation of the activity of Sst interneurons,
with potential circuit implications of cell type–
specific disinhibition and compartmentalized
inhibitory and disinhibitory effects on pyram-
idal cells (fig. S7). At the cellular scale, this mod-
ulation could dramatically change the reception
and integration of excitatory inputs that are spa-
tially segregated by layers (46, 47), as well as
their impact on the initiation sites of dendritic

ing of associative and sensory signals in L2/3
and L4, respectively, might be strengthened be-
cause of Sst interneuron–mediated disinhibi-

in L5, the main cortical output layer, might be

dendritic inhibition gates neuronal and net-
work excitability. Additional work is needed to
