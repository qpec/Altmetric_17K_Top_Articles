n the current cost- and resource-constrained healthcare environment in the United States, characterized by declining government 
reimbursement and increased utilization scrutiny by managed care plans, providers are challenged to continue delivering quality care to 
more patients while also more effectively managing practice economics. Employing technology to improve practice efficiency is one of the 
most promising solutions to this dilemma. We have demonstrated that the integration of ultra-widefield (UWF) retinal imaging in our practice is 
cost-effective. It has allowed us to increase the number of patient encounters while simultaneously raising the quality of care, and increasing 
patient satisfaction.

Ophthalmic medical practices in the United States are under unprecedented pressure to care for a 
rapidly growing population of patients, even as Medicare reimbursement levels continue to decline 
and payers are implementing payment programs based on cost and quality metrics. The Centers 
for Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS) has continued to enact significant cuts to payment 
rates for a range of ophthalmic procedures, from glaucoma surgery to retinal detachment repair 
and various diagnostic imaging procedures. These are only the latest changes to the economics of 
care delivery to which ophthalmologists must rapidly adjust. More than ever, the financial viability 
 
of the ophthalmology practice depends on its ability to deliver efficient care – integrating cost, quality, 
outcomes, and patient satisfaction – within an ever-changing landscape of medical innovation, 
government regulation, payer intervention, and patient expectation.
Several years ago, we formally evaluated the relative efficiency of academic hospital center and 
small group practices by applying activity-based cost analysis to both settings.1 We found that the 
small group practice outperformed the academic medical center on nearly all markers of efficiency. 
In the latter setting, only four service lines – non-laser surgery (e.g., pneumatic retinopexy, pars 
plana vitrectomy, scleral buckling surgery), laser surgery (e.g., pan-retinal photocoagulation, retinal 
tear repair), diagnostic imaging other than optical coherence tomography (OCT) (e.g., fundus 
imaging and ultrasound) , and injections – were profitable, with profit margins ranging from 62% 
for non-laser surgery to 1% for intravitreal injections. The largest negative profit contributions were 
generated by office visits and OCT imaging. The continued reduction of reimbursement rates for both 
diagnostic services and therapeutic injections in the intervening years has made conditions even 
more challenging for both types of practice and has increased the critical importance of evaluating 
and improving efficiency. Various models for measuring and comparing practicing efficiency are in 
development. For example, an efficiency index, calculated as a function of cost, number of patients 
receiving care, and the quality of care, has been proposed to measure the care delivery process for a 
given intervention within the ophthalmic practice.2 As such models are expanded to include outcome 
measures and are validated in larger inter-practice comparisons they may be useful in efforts to 
improve both the quality and efficiency of care.
Regardless of how efficiency is measured, it is increasingly clear that one key to the challenge of 
simultaneously improving practice efficiency and quality of care amid relentless financial pressure 
is the use of advanced technology – diagnostic and treatment systems that provide more useful 
clinical information, more rapidly, and with greater comfort or convenience for patients. An example 
along these lines is the positive impact on efficiency and quality of care in cataract and refractive 
practices produced by the integration of wavefront technology. The impact of this technology for 
digital refraction and optical path diagnostics was recently described, with the authors noting that 
the speed and comprehensiveness of total visual system assessment improved outcomes, patient

satisfaction and cost-effectiveness.3 We have seen analogous benefits in 
our practice from the routine use of ultra-widefield (UWFTM) retinal imaging 
using the Optos system. This paper will describe how the integration of 
UWF retinal imaging improved efficiency and quality of care, enhanced 
patient satisfaction, and allowed more patients to be examined during a 
fixed time interval in our practice. We show that the resulting increase in 
patient volume can improve cash flow irrespective of reimbursement rates 
or how payments for testing are bundled. 
Elements of efficiency for diagnostic imaging
The unparalleled field of view (sometimes called “pan-retinal” imaging), 
rapid, patient-friendly image capture, high-resolution, and easy transmission 
of UWF optomap® (Optos, plc. Dunfermline, Scotland) imaging make it 
well suited to enhancing the efficiency and quality of ophthalmic care. 
The Optos system provides the widest field of view of any retinal imaging 
platform.4 The high-resolution digital image it produces is obtained in a 
single, non-contact, often non-mydriatic capture lasting about a second; 
the image is immediately available for evaluation by the clinician and 
review with the patient on a computer screen or tablet. Cross-registration 
of different imaging modalities or prior images is instantaneous, supporting 
comprehensive evaluation of retinal pathology or disease progression. 
 
The systems are DICOM compatible and utilize cloud-based transmission 
and storage to facilitate image sharing with other offices and practices, as 
well as archiving as part of the medical record. 
A growing body of research has demonstrated the potential of UWF 
imaging to improve detection, documentation, and management of retinal 
pathology, particularly in zones of the periphery outside the field of view of 
conventional imaging. The potential of UWF imaging to improve the diagnosis 
and management of diabetic retinopathy (DR), one of our principle areas of 
clinical interest, is well documented.5 Multiple investigators have favorably 
compared UWF to conventional Early Treatment Diabetic Retinopathy Study 
(ETDRS) 7-fields, the standard DR assessment tool, observing that optomap 
images cover a much larger area of the retina, despite being acquired much 
more quickly and often without dilation.6–8 Our own experience supports 
the conclusions of these and other studies which confirm that the use of 
UWF color imaging and UWF FA result in the detection of more pathology, 
including early signs of DR progression such as peripheral microaneurysms, 
neovascularization, vascular nonperfusion, and vascular leakage. These 
key indicators of disease severity might be missed or minimized by exams 
depending on standard field imaging.9–11 The greater accuracy and efficiency 
of UWF imaging has proven particularly useful in teleophthalmology. In 
one national ocular telehealth program focused on DR, nonmydriatic UWF 
imaging reduced the ungradable image rate by 81%, nearly doubled the 
identification of DR, and identified peripheral lesions suggestive of more 
severe disease in nearly 10% of patients, compared to nonmydriatic multi-
field fundus photography.12
 
We have consistently seen similar benefits in our practice and have 
carefully evaluated the impact of UWF retinal imaging on the quality, cost-
effectiveness and revenue potential of the care we deliver, as well as its 
contribution to patient satisfaction. 
UWF improves the quality of care
Fundamentally, quality in the context of the medical practice is doing 
the right thing, correctly, the first time. By this definition, each diagnostic 
procedure performed should provide the necessary support for the

The Impact of Ultra-widefield Retinal Imaging on Practice Efficiency
subsequent interventions. In examining the impact of UWF on quality, 
we should recognize that the optomap does not replace the retinal 
examination, particularly of the periphery, or scleral depression but it 
facilitates this examination by providing a pan-retinal overview allowing 
the clinician to focus attention on pathological findings of interest. Since 
the upper eye lid may limit visualization of the inferior retina, examination 
of the peripheral retinal is still necessary. The use of UWF also improves 
workflow efficiency by decreasing the technician time required for image 
acquisition and decreasing the time the patient must spend in the waiting 
room. Furthermore, as the extensive literature suggests, employing UWF 
first, on every patient, ensures that our team does not miss pathology, 
such as melanomas, retinal detachments, or DR, even on the busiest 
clinic day (see Figures 1–3). UWF imaging often reveals pathology that 
might be overlooked during the clinical exam, including signs of systemic 
disease, such as subtle vascular sheathing or rare microaneurysms, 
suggestive of diabetes, hypertension or carotid disease, in patients with 
no such diagnosis or symptoms. In fact, our experience reflects published 
studies that suggest UWF retinal imaging can be an outstanding screening 
tool – rapid and easy to perform, convenient for the patient, clinically 
useful, and readily shared. Finally, in situations with media changes, such 
as gas bubbles following retinal surgery, or in patients with small pupils or 
those who cannot tolerate a full exam, UWF provides the most effective 
way to examine the retina.
UWF improves the cost-effectiveness of care
When considering cost-effectiveness, clinicians must assess whether the 
revenue produced by a new technology is sufficient to cover the cost 
of its acquisition and whether a particular unit of care can be delivered 
in a profitable way for the practice. This means it must be acceptable to 
the payer and reimbursed at a revenue positive level. We have examined 
several potential impacts of UWF retinal imaging on revenue drivers in 
our practice, including its potential to increase the number of billable 
photographs and angiograms we take and the number of laser treatments 
we perform. We reviewed yearly patient encounters prior to and one and 
two years following the installation of our UWF retinal imaging system. With 
the use of UWF, the absolute number of photographs taken has increased; 
however, since not every image is considered medically-necessary by 
payer rules, the revenue contribution of this increase was relatively 
minor (for our analysis, we’ve assumed only a 50% reimbursement rate). 
 
We also documented an increase in FA’s and a small number of additional 
laser treatments, specifically in patients with non-proliferative DR 
 
in whom UWF had documented severe peripheral nonperfusion prior 
 
to the development of frank neovascularization. The volume change and 
revenue contributions of these three lines of service after the first year 
are summarized in Table 1. 
By far, the most significant financial impact UWF has made in our 
practice is the increase in the number of patients we are able to see. 
This is largely the result of the reduction in the ‘busy work’ component of 
 
the office examination, such as noting cup-to-disc ratios, the presence 
 
of drusen, or retinal pigment epithelium and vascular changes. The use 
of UWF also facilitates more rapid determination of changes in peripheral 
lesions, including tumor growth, sheathing, or intraretinal microvascular 
abnormalities (IrMA). In the first year after we integrated UWF retinal 
imaging, we saw 220 more patients, an increase of 4.4% over the pre-UWF 
period, which was an average of 1.5 additional patient encounters per day. 
This translated over $40,000 in incremental revenue. In the second year of 
UWF use, patient volume increased by 7%. The total incremental revenue 
generated by the integration of UWF was approximately $76,000 per year 
or $6,333 per month. As a result, the Optos UWF retinal imaging system 
we purchased paid for itself in just over a year. After 4 years of routine 
UWF retinal imaging, we have an average exam time of 11 minutes and 
are able to see 45 patients on a clinic day, with high patient satisfaction. 
 
We are now incorporating two ‘followers,’ one to a Scribe position, the 
other to care for the immediate needs of post-injection patients, which 
should further decrease physician ‘busy work’ time by several minutes 
per patient, increasing patient capacity to 55 to 60 patients per day. 
Obviously, the type of visit encounter will affect the number of patient 
daily encounters. We give all injections at the time of the exam visit, and 
frequently give bilateral injections for patient convenience. Given that 
reimbursement rates have continued to decline (in our area, fundus 
photography is now reimbursed at $71 and FA at $92), the contribution 
of patient volume to the economic equation is even more significant. Of 
course, the financial benefit of integrating UWF will vary by practice but 
our experience is generally consistent with anecdotal reports we have 
heard from other retina offices.
It is worth noting that the combination of declining reimbursement 
levels and managed care plan payment adjustments based on utilization 
make the traditional practice of performing multiple diagnostic tests 
counterproductive from a revenue standpoint. By providing more 
information from a single test, data which has a direct impact on the 
quality of care, and by allowing more patients to be examined, UWF retinal 
imaging represents a new economic model for the ophthalmic practice, 
based on seeing more patients, not ordering more tests. Discovery and 
documentation of retinal pathology with an initial optomap also supports 
reimbursement of subsequent confirmatory tests like a UWF-guided 
peripheral exam with an indirect ophthalmoscope or OCT. The irrefutable 
documentation of the status of the retina at the time of the visit may also 
have beneficial medicolegal implications.
UWF increases patient satisfaction
Particularly when compared to conventional dilated fundus photography, 
UWF retinal imaging positively impacts the patient experience. The 
scanning laser ophthalmoscope (SLO) light is much more comfortable than 
the bright flash of traditional photography and the speed of image capture 
significantly reduces the amount of time patients spend in the office not 
actually receiving care. The reduction of physical exam time and related 
‘busy work’ through the use of UWF retinal imaging also increases the 
proportion of the visit available for establishing a positive patient/doctor

relationship, as well as patient counseling and education. Furthermore, 
the value of showing a patient what their actual retina looks like, rather 
than trying to explain using drawings or models, cannot be overstated. 
 
For example, patients who present with a retinal tear can be educated 
about flashes and floaters with a short video and then see the pathology 
on their own optomap. This increases their sense of urgency and their 
willingness to follow the treatment plan. Reviewing their UWF image helps 
them appreciate the benefits of early detection and understand why 
prompt treatment is critical to protect their vision.
We have also seen firsthand that improved patient satisfaction provides 
additional support for the flow of new patients, as happy patients tell their 
families and friends about their experience. The overall impact of the full 
integration of UWF retinal imaging in our practice is an increase of 12% 
in patient volume.
Conclusion
In order to thrive in the current healthcare environment, ophthalmic 
practices must attract and manage larger numbers of patients while 
simultaneously delivering high-quality, cost-effective care. To balance 
this equation – to maintain healthy revenue streams while providing 
quality care – ophthalmologists must utilize technology that will improve 
practice efficiency. The integration of UWF retinal imaging to produce 
more clinically-relevant information, more rapidly and in a more patient-
friendly manner, can make important contributions to multiple aspects of 
the efficiency challenge.
