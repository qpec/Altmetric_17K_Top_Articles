Ground-level ozone and fine particulate matter (PM2.5) are associated with premature human 
mortality1–4; their future concentrations depend on changes in emissions, which dominate 
the near-term5, and on climate change6,7. Previous global studies of the air quality-related 
health effects of future climate change8,9 used single atmospheric models. However, in 
related studies, mortality results differ among models10–12. Here we use an ensemble of 
global chemistry-climate models13 to show that premature mortality from changes in air 
pollution attributable to climate change, under the high greenhouse gas scenario RCP8.514,

 is likely positive. We estimate 3,340 (−30,300 to 47,100) ozone-related deaths in 2030, 
relative to 2000 climate, and 43,600 (−195,000 to 237,000) in 2100 (14% of the increase in 
global ozone-related mortality). For PM2.5, we estimate 55,600 (−34,300 to 164,000) deaths 
in 2030 and 215,000 (−76,100 to 595,000) in 2100 (countering by 16% the global decrease 
in PM2.5-related mortality). Premature mortality attributable to climate change is estimated 
to be positive in all regions except Africa, and is greatest in India and East Asia. Most 
individual models yield increased mortality from climate change, but some yield decreases, 
suggesting caution in interpreting results from a single model. Climate change mitigation 
will likely reduce air pollution-related mortality.
Climate change can affect air quality through several pathways, including changes in the 
ventilation and dilution of air pollutants, photochemical reaction rates, removal processes, 
stratosphere−troposphere exchange of ozone, wildfires, and natural biogenic and lightning 
emissions6,7. Overall, changes in these processes are expected to increase ozone in polluted 
regions during the warm season, especially in urban areas and during pollution episodes, but 
decrease ozone in remote regions due to greater water vapour concentrations leading to 
greater ozone destruction. These effects are exacerbated by the greater decomposition of 
reservoir species such as PAN7. PM2.5 will also be affected by climate change, but impacts 
vary in sign among models and show regional variation related to differences in 
precipitation, wildfires, biogenic emissions, PM2.5 composition, and other factors.
Previous studies have examined the impact of future climate change on human health via air 
quality globally8–9,15, in the US10, 16–20, and in Europe21. However, only two studies have 
previously used an ensemble of models to assess air pollution-related mortality attributable 
to climate change: one for the US10, and our previous global work with the same ensemble 
used here, but evaluating the effects of historical climate change prior to 200011. Both 
studies found a large spread of mortality outcomes depending on the atmospheric model 
used. Silva et al.11 found that the multi-model average suggested a small detrimental effect 
of climate change on global present-day air pollution-related mortality, but individual 
models yielded estimates of opposing sign.
The Atmospheric Chemistry and Climate Model Intercomparison Project (ACCMIP) 
ensemble (Supplementary Table 1) simulated air quality in 2000, and in 2030, 2050 and 
2100 for the four global Representative Concentration Pathway scenarios (RCPs)22. We 
previously estimated future air pollution premature mortality under all four RCP scenarios, 
estimating the net effect of both emissions changes and climate change12. Under RCP8.5, 
ozone concentrations increase in most locations in 2100 relative to 2000, due to increases in 
methane emissions and the effect of climate change7,23, but PM2.5 decreases in 2100 due to 
a projected decrease in particulate and precursor emissions24. These changes in pollutant 
concentrations lead to 316,000 (95% C.I.: −187,000 to 1.38 million) ozone-related excess 
deaths yr−1 and −1.31 (−2.04 to −0.17) million PM2.5-related (avoided) deaths yr−1 in 
210012. Here we present results from additional ACCMIP simulations that were designed to 
isolate the influences of future climate change under RCP8.5, by simulating the projected 
climates of 2030 and 2100 (imposed by prescribing sea-surface temperatures, sea ice cover, 
and greenhouse gas concentrations for radiation) together with air pollutant emissions from 
2000. The effects of climate change are then isolated by a difference with historical 2000

 simulations. Premature mortality attributable to RCP8.5 climate change is estimated 
following the methods of Silva et al.12, including projected population and baseline 
mortality rates (see Methods), such that mortality estimates here can be compared directly 
with overall changes in air pollution-related mortality in RCP8.5.
We estimate that global ozone mortality attributable to RCP8.5 climate change will be 3,340 
(−30,300 to 47,100) deaths yr−1 in 2030 and 43,600 (−195,000 to 237,000) deaths yr−1 in 
2100 (Figures 1a and 2a). In 2100, ozone mortality increases in most regions, especially in 
highly populated and highly polluted areas, with marked spatial differences within regions 
that include both positive and negative mortality changes (Figure 3a, Supplementary Table 2, 
Supplementary Figures 1 and 2a). The effect on ozone mortality in 2100 is greatest in East 
Asia (45,600 deaths yr−1, 41 deaths yr−1 per million people), India (16,000 deaths yr−1, 8 
deaths yr−1 per million people) and North America (9,830 deaths yr−1, 13 deaths yr−1 per 
million people), but some areas within these and other regions show decreases in mortality. 
East Asia has high mortality effects per person in part because of its higher projected 
mortality rate from respiratory diseases. Climate change contributes 14% of the overall 
increase in ozone mortality estimated for RCP8.5 in 2100 relative to 200012. However, three 
of 8 models in 2030 and three of 9 in 2100 show global decreases in ozone mortality due to 
climate change. For each model, the uncertainty range does not include zero; only the spread 
of models causes the overall uncertainty to span zero. Uncertainty in modeled ozone 
concentrations contributes over 97% to the overall uncertainty in both 2030 and 2100, with 
the remainder from uncertainties in relative risk (RR). Results from a sensitivity analysis 
using present-day population and baseline mortality rates (Table 1) show 32% and 67% 
lower mortality estimates in 2030 and 2100, respectively, largely because the projected 
baseline mortality rates of chronic respiratory diseases increase through 2100. The models 
agree that ozone will increase due to climate change in some polluted regions, notably the 
northeast US as found in other studies6 and decrease in the tropics over the oceans 
(Supplementary Figures 3 and 4a). These changes are consistent with those analysed by 
Schnell et al.25 for 2100, using four of these same models, and were attributed to a greater 
efficiency of precursor emissions to generate surface ozone in polluted regions, along with 
reductions in the export of precursors to downwind regions.
The impact of climate change on PM2.5 mortality is estimated to result in 55,600 (−34,300 
to 164,000) deaths yr−1 in 2030 and 215,000 (−76,100 to 595,000) deaths yr−1 in 2100 
(Figures 1b and 2b). Mean estimates of PM2.5 mortality increase in 2100 in all regions 
except Africa (−25,200 deaths yr−1) (Figure 3b, Supplementary Table 3, Supplementary 
Figure 2b). The greatest increases in mortality in 2100 occur in India (80,200 deaths yr−1, 40 
deaths yr−1 per million people), Middle East (50,400 deaths yr−1, 45 deaths yr−1 per million 
people) and East Asia (47,200 deaths yr−1, 43 deaths yr−1 per million people), although the 
Former Soviet Union shows greater mortality per million people in 2100 (11,800 deaths yr
−1, 57 deaths yr−1 per million people). Similar to ozone mortality, there are substantial 
spatial differences within each region, including both increases and decreases in mortality. 
For PM2.5, a large decrease in mortality is projected in RCP8.5 relative to 2000 (when 
accounting for changes in both emissions and climate)12, but climate change alone increases 
mortality, partially counteracting the decrease associated with declining emissions in 
RCP8.5. Without climate change, the decrease in PM2.5-related mortality would be roughly

 16% greater in 2100 relative to 2000. Propagating uncertainty in RR to the mortality 
estimates leads to coefficients of variation (CVs) of 8–31% (2030) and 11–46% (2100) for 
the different models, but the spread of model results increases overall CVs to 123% in 2030 
and 106% in 2100. In both years, one model (GISS-E2-R) yields a decrease in global 
mortality from climate change while the other three (2030) or four (2100) show an increase. 
Uncertainty in modeled PM2.5 concentrations in 2000 makes a similar contribution to the 
overall uncertainty (50% in 2030 and 52% in 2100) compared with uncertainty in modeled 
PM2.5 concentrations in future years (50% in 2030, 48% in 2100). Uncertainty in RR makes 
a negligible contribution in both periods (<1%), as the multi-model mean is small and 
different models disagree on the sign of the influence. Considering present-day population 
and baseline mortality rates (Table 1), we estimate 23% and 33% lower mortality in 2030 
and 2100, respectively, mostly associated with the increase in projected baseline mortality 
rates through 2100.
PM2.5-related mortality was estimated above for the sum of PM2.5 species reported by five 
models, using a common formula (see Methods), to increase the number of models 
considered and to increase consistency among PM2.5 estimates. Additionally, we present a 
sensitivity analysis considering the PM2.5 concentrations reported by four models using 
their own PM2.5 formulas, for which multi-model average mortality results are modestly 
higher: 15% greater in 2030 and 12% in 2100 (Supplementary Figure 5). The degree of 
agreement between the two estimates varies among the four models, and for one model 
(GISS-E2-R) the two sources of PM2.5 estimates yield impacts of different sign in 2030.
There is considerable agreement among models regarding the increase in PM2.5 
concentrations in many locations in 2100, including most polluted regions, due to RCP8.5 
climate change (Supplementary Figure 4b). Allen et al.26 analysed four of these same 
models in 2100 and found that global average surface PM2.5 concentrations increased due to 
climate change, reflecting increases in nearly all relevant species for each model. They 
attributed this increase in PM2.5 mainly to a decrease in wet deposition associated with less 
large-scale precipitation over land. Our multi-model mean estimates of global population-
weighted changes for PM2.5 and individual species (Supplementary Table 4; Supplementary 
Figure 6) are similar to those of Allen et al.26. Unlike Allen et al.26, however, GISS-E2-R 
shows a net decrease in global population-weighted concentrations of total PM2.5 and of 
each PM2.5 species except sea salt, in 2100, likely due to projected concentration decreases 
over densely-populated eastern China. Models also differ strongly in the sign and magnitude 
of changes in dust, particularly over North Africa and the Middle East; HadGEM2 projects 
increases in PM2.5 for all species except dust, but a strong decrease in dust over the Middle 
East and South Asia. In Africa, the decrease in PM2.5 near the equator is likely caused by 
increased precipitation, whereas PM2.5 increases are associated with precipitation decreases 
in Southern Africa26. Differences in PM2.5 (and ozone) responses to climate change among 
models likely result from differences in large-scale meteorological changes, and different 
treatments of atmospheric chemistry and feedback processes among the models (such as the 
response of dust to climate change).
In the US, our multi-model mean mortality estimates for the impact of RCP8.5 climate 
change for ozone (1,130 deaths yr−1 in 2030; 8,810 deaths yr−1 in 2100) compare well with

 those of Fann et al.20, who report 420 to 1900 ozone-related deaths yr−1 for RCP8.5 climate 
change in 2030, despite differences in concentration-response functions and population and 
baseline mortality projections. These results for ozone and those for PM2.5 (6,900 deaths yr
−1 in 2030; 19,400 deaths yr−1in 2100) are also consistent with the increases in mortality and 
spatial heterogeneity attributed to climate change in 2050 by Bell et al.16 for ozone and 
Tagaris et al.17 for ozone and PM2.5, although these studies used different climate change 
scenarios besides other methodological differences. Across models, our estimates for ozone 
mortality in the US vary between −435 and 4,750 deaths yr−1 in 2030 and between −1,820 
and 27,012 deaths yr−1 in 2100. This spread of model results, with a few models suggesting 
avoided mortality due to climate change, is similar to that of Post et al.10 (−600 to 2,500 
deaths yr−1 in 2050) using SRES scenarios of GHG emissions. Similarly, results show 
spatial heterogeneity within several regions (Figure 2) that is similar to Post et al.10 for the 
US and Orru et al.21 for Europe.
The spread of results among models highlights the uncertainty in the effect of climate 
change on air quality. Further improvements in chemistry climate models are needed to 
better model the interaction and feedbacks between climate and air quality, including the 
sensitivity of biogenic emissions to climate change, the effects of meteorological changes on 
air quality (e.g., aerosol-cloud interactions, secondary aerosol formation, wet deposition, and 
gas-aerosol partitioning), and the impact of climate change on wildfires. Stratosphere-
troposphere exchange of ozone is also important, as is the impact of land use changes on 
regional climate and air pollution. Our results are specific to climate change as projected 
under RCP8.5 and would differ for other scenarios. We estimate the effect of climate change 
as the difference between simulations with future climate and year 2000 climate, both with 
year 2000 emissions, although global emissions of PM2.5 and its main precursors decrease 
under RCP8.5. Had we instead modelled future emissions with present vs. future climate, we 
would likely have attributed smaller changes in air pollution and mortality to climate change, 
given the projected emission reductions. Whereas the net effect of missing and uncertain 
processes does not clearly indicate an under- or overestimate for the effect of climate change 
on air quality, we likely underestimate the magnitude of the health impact by omitting 
mortality for people under 25, and morbidity effects. We also neglect possible synergistic 
effects of a warmer climate to modify air pollution-mortality relationships. Although a few 
studies have suggested stronger relationships between ozone27 and PM2.528 and health at 
higher temperatures, there is insufficient evidence to include those effects here.
Despite these uncertainties, this study is the first to use a multi-model ensemble to show that 
global air pollution-related mortality attributable to climate change is likely positive. The 
spread of results among models within the ensemble, including differences in the sign of 
global and regional mortality estimates, suggests that results from studies using a single 
model and a small number of model years should be interpreted cautiously. Actions to 
mitigate climate change, such as reductions in long-lived GHG emissions, will likely benefit 
human health by reducing the effect of climate change on air quality in many locations. 
These health benefits are likely to be smaller than those from reducing co-emitted air 
pollutants29, but both types of health benefits via changes in air quality would add to 
reductions in many other influences of climate change on human health30.

The Atmospheric Chemistry and Climate Model Intercomparison Project (ACCMIP)13 
included contributions from 14 modelling groups, of which 9 completed simulations that are 
used here (Supplementary Table 1). ACCMIP models incorporate chemistry-climate 
interactions, including mechanisms by which climate change affects ozone and PM2.5, 
although models do not all include the same interactions, and do not always agree on their 
net effects7. Of these nine, three models are not truly coupled chemistry-climate models: 
MOCAGE is a chemical transport model driven by external meteorology, and UM-CAM and 
STOC-HadAM3 do not model the feedback of chemistry on climate13. As a result, these 
models do not fully capture the effects of changes in air pollutant concentrations on 
processes that affect meteorology, such as through radiative transfer and clouds. Prescribed 
anthropogenic and biomass burning emissions were very similar for the different models, but 
they used different natural emissions (e.g. biogenic volatile organic compounds, ocean 
emissions, soil and lightning NOx)14, 23. Modelled 2000 concentrations show good 
agreement with observations for ozone23 and PM2.524, although models tend to overestimate 
ozone in the Northern Hemisphere and underestimate it in the Southern Hemisphere, and to 
underestimate PM2.5, particularly in East Asia.
We isolate the effect of climate change on air quality as the difference in concentrations 
between ACCMIP simulations using year 2000 emissions together with future year climate, 
imposed by prescribing RCP8.531 sea surface temperatures, sea ice cover, and GHGs (for 
radiation) for 2030 and 2100 (referred to as “Em2000Cl2030” and “Em2000Cl2100”), and 
simulations with 2000 emissions and climate (“acchist2000”)13. We analyse results from the 
nine models reporting ozone from the Em2000Cl2030/2100 simulations, and the five 
reporting PM2.5 (Supplementary Table 1). Ozone and PM2.5 species surface concentrations 
from each model are calculated in each grid cell, after regridding output from the native 
horizontal resolutions of each model (1.9°×1.2° to 5°×5°) to a common 0.5°×0.5° resolution. 
To be consistent with the epidemiological studies considered1,4, we use the seasonal average 
of daily 1-hr maximum ozone concentrations for the six consecutive months with highest 
concentrations in each grid cell, and annual average PM2.5 concentration.
Seven of the nine models with Em2000Cl2030/2100 simulations reported both hourly and 
monthly ozone concentrations, while two reported only monthly values. We calculate the 
ratio of the 6-month average of daily 1-hr maximum concentrations to the annual average 
concentrations, for each grid cell and each year, for those models that reported both hourly 
and monthly concentrations; then, we apply that ratio to the annual average ozone 
concentrations for the other two models, following Silva et al.11,12.
We calculate PM2.5 concentration using the sum of PM2.5 species mass mixing ratios 
reported by five models and a common formula:
PM2.5 = BC + OA + SO4 + SOA + NH4 + 0.25 ∗ SS + 0.1 ∗ Dust,
where BC – Black Carbon, OA – (Primary) Organic Aerosol corrected to include species 
other than carbon, NH4 – NH4 in ammonium sulfate, SOA – Secondary Organic Aerosol,

 and SS – Sea Salt, as had been done previously by Fiore et al.33 and Silva et al.11,12. The 
factors 0.25 and 0.1 are intended to approximate the fractions of sea salt and dust that are in 
the PM2.5 size range. Nitrate was reported by three models, but we chose to omit nitrate 
from our PM2.5 formula to avoid imposing changes inconsistent with the effect of climate 
change for other models, following Silva et al.11, although nitrate was included in estimates 
of total PM2.5 by Silva et al.12. Four of these models also reported their own estimate of 
PM2.5 (Supplementary Table 1).
The impact of climate change on global population-weighted differences 
(Em2000Cl2030/2100 minus acchist2000) in PM2.5 and ozone concentrations for the 
different models are shown in Supplementary Tables 4 and 5, respectively, while regional 
multi-model average differences are shown in Supplementary Figures 7 and 8.
We estimate premature mortality by calculating the fraction of cause-specific mortality 
attributable to long-term changes in pollutant concentrations, using methods that are 
identical to those of Silva et al.12, so that mortality attributable to climate change can be 
compared simply with changes in mortality under the RCP scenarios. We use relative risks 
(RRs) from Jerrett et al.1 for ozone and respiratory diseases and Burnett et al.4 for PM2.5 and 
cardiopulmonary diseases and lung cancer. Then, we apply that attributable fraction in each 
grid cell to future adult population (age 25 and older) and baseline mortality rates based on 
projections from the International Futures (IFs) integrated modelling system32. Using 
country-level projections per age group, we mapped and gridded to the 0.5°×0.5° grid 
assuming that the present-day spatial distribution of total population within each country is 
unchanged in the future, as well as the present-day ratio of baseline mortality for the specific 
causes included in the epidemiological studies and for three disease groups projected in IFs 
(chronic respiratory diseases, cardiovascular diseases and malignant neoplasms). We select 
population projections from IFs instead of those underlying RCP8.5 to ensure consistency 
between projections of population and baseline mortality, since the latter are not available 
for RCP8.5, and for consistency with Silva et al.12. IFs projections of future total population 
are lower than those of RCP8.5 (−5% in 2030 and −27% in 2100) (Supplementary Figure 9). 
Had we used projections of population underlying RCP8.5, we would have likely estimated 
greater changes in premature mortality relative to 2000. IFs projections of baseline mortality 
rates reflect an aging population and regional demographic changes, showing a steep rise in 
chronic respiratory diseases (roughly tripling globally by 2100), particularly in East Asia 
and India, some regional increases in cardiovascular diseases (e.g. Middle East, Africa), and 
global decreases in lung cancer.
Overall uncertainty in mortality estimates includes uncertainty from the RRs and from air 
pollutant concentrations. First, we conduct 1000 Monte Carlo (MC) simulations separately 
for each model-year to propagate uncertainty from the RRs to mortality estimates. For 
ozone, we use the 95% Confidence Intervals (CIs) for RR reported by Jerrett et al.1 and 
assume a normal distribution, while for PM2.5 we use the parameter values of Burnett et al.4 
for 1000 MC simulations. Then, we calculate the average and 95% CI for the pooled results 
of the 1000 MC simulations for each model to quantify the spread of model results. We do 
not include uncertainties associated with population and baseline mortality rates, since these 
are not reported. As ACCMIP models used the same anthropogenic and biomass burning

 emissions, we do not consider uncertainty in emissions inventories, however we 
acknowledge that this is an important source of uncertainty, especially in particular 
regions34–37. Our mortality estimates are affected by our choices of and underlying 
assumptions regarding concentration-response functions, population, and baseline mortality 
rates. Although a number of factors, such as vulnerability of the exposed population and 
PM2.5 composition, vary spatially and possibly temporally, we assume that the RRs 
estimated for the present day apply on a global scale and in future time periods. Also, our 
assumption that the spatial distribution of population within each country is constant in the 
future likely understates the effects of rural-to-urban migration, which is currently underway 
and expected to continue. However, the effects of climate change on air pollutant 
concentrations may be somewhat spatially uniform (as opposed to changes in emissions), 
and the coarse grid resolution of global models would not resolve air pollutant 
concentrations well in urban areas.

 Figure 1. 
Impact of RCP8.5 climate change on global mortality for individual models and the multi-
model average. Estimates are for 2030 and 2100 for (a) ozone respiratory mortality (9 
models) and (b) PM2.5 IHD+STROKE+COPD+LC mortality (5 models). PM2.5 is 
calculated as a sum of species. Uncertainty for each model is the 95% CI taking into account 
uncertainty in RR. Uncertainty for the multi-model average is the 95% CI including 
uncertainty in RR and across models.
