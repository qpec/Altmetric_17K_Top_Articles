Summary 
16 
Stereotyped synaptic connections define the neural circuits of the brain. In vertebrates, stimulus-independent 
17 
activity contributes to neural circuit formation. It is unknown whether this type of activity is a general feature of 
18 
nervous system development. Here, we report patterned, stimulus-independent neural activity in the Drosophila 
19 
visual system during synaptogenesis. Using in vivo calcium, voltage, and glutamate imaging, we found that all 
20 
neurons participate in this spontaneous activity, which is characterized by brain-wide periodic active and silent 
21 
phases. Glia are active in a complementary pattern. Each of the 15 examined of the over 100 specific neuron 
22 
types in the fly visual system exhibited a unique activity signature. The activity of neurons that are synaptic 
23 
partners in the adult was highly correlated during development. We propose that this cell type-specific activity 
24 
coordinates the development of the functional circuitry of the adult brain.

Introduction 
31 
Synaptic connections between neurons determine how neural circuits process information. 
32 
Understanding how the specificity of these connections is established is a central challenge in neurobiology. In 
33 
vertebrates, cell autonomous genetic programs and neural activity—both evoked and spontaneous—contribute 
34 
to the development of synapses. Spontaneous activity has been observed throughout the developing central 
35 
nervous system (CNS)—in the hippocampus (Ben-Ari et al., 1989), spinal cord (Landmesser and O’Donovan, 
36 
1984), cerebellum (Watt et al., 2009), auditory system (Tritsch et al., 2007), and visual system (Galli and 
37 
Maffei, 1988; Meister et al., 1991). Retinal waves were discovered over 20 years ago and are the best 
38 
characterized examples of spontaneous activity (reviewed in Ackman and Crair, 2014; Blankenship and Feller, 
39 
2009; Kirkby et al., 2013; Sernagor and Hennig, 2013). In mice and other mammalian models, retinal waves 
40 
begin soon after the completion of axon guidance and persist through eye opening. During this period, bursts of 
41 
activity propagate from the retina to higher visual centers, including the lateral geniculate nucleus (LGN), the 
42 
superior colliculus (SC), and the visual cortex (Ackman et al., 2012). In each of these areas, large populations of 
43 
neighboring cells exhibit correlated firing patterns. Significant progress has been made toward characterizing 
44 
and identifying the organizing principles of spontaneous activity in the developing vertebrate brain, and the 
45 
precise developmental role of this activity is an area of active interest. 
46 
By contrast to vertebrates, brain development in invertebrates is thought to be driven by hardwired 
47 
morphogenetic programs driven by cell recognition molecules, with little role for spontaneous or experience-
48 
dependent neural activity. Previous work has shown that, in the Drosophila visual system, photoreceptor

neurons can develop the wild-type complement of synapses in a stimulus-independent manner (Hiesinger et al., 
50 
2006). However, the existence and significance of spontaneous activity during invertebrate brain development 
51 
remains an open question. 
52 
Some of the most detailed understanding of brain development in the fly comes from the visual system. 
53 
Visual information from the compound eye is relayed in a topographic fashion to the optic neuropils—the 
54 
lamina, medulla, and the lobula complex. These neuropils are organized into columns and layers. In general,  
55 
columns process information from different points in visual space, and layers process different types of visual 
56 
information. Over 100 different neuronal cell types form precise synaptic connections, typically with several 
57 
different cell types. The three dimensional EM re-constructions of the optic neuropils that reveal this wiring 
58 
complexity (Rivera-Alba et al., 2011; Takemura et al., 2013, 2017) also underscore the challenge of 
59 
understanding the mechanisms of synaptic specificity: Most neurons make synapses with only a subset of their 
60 
contact neighbors, and the area of contact has little bearing on this decision. 
61 
Visual system development in the fly takes place during the last stage of larval development and the 
62 
ensuing 100 hours of metamorphosis, or pupal development. Synapse formation, as well as axon guidance and 
63 
morphogenesis, are predicated on cell-cell contacts. As such, much of the focus in the study of neural 
64 
development has been on the roles of cell surface and recognition molecules. This body of work, carried out at 
65 
the level of individual cell types, paints the picture of a dynamic self-assembly process in which local 
66 
interactions shape the developmental trajectory of each neuron (Hadjieconomou et al., 2011; Huang et al., 1998; 
67 
Pecot et al., 2014). By 50 hours after pupa formation (hAPF), these specific and genetically hardwired 
68 
molecular push-pulls bring most of the cell types of the visual system to where they belong in the adult brain, 
69 
ready for synaptogenesis. Over the remaining 50 hours of pupal development, synapse assembly proceeds in 
70 
parallel with notable changes in gene expression, including the upregulation of genes involved in neural activity 
71 
and new sets of cell recognition molecules (Chen et al., 2014; Tan et al., 2015; Zhang et al., 2016). It is during 
72 
this time that vast networks are assembled, comprising distant cells which must be linked through specific 
73 
synaptic connections and compatible gene expression profiles (e.g. matching neurotransmitter systems and 
74 
receptors). Little is known about the molecules and mechanisms that coordinate this period of brain 
75 
development.  
76 
Here we report the discovery of stimulus-independent neural activity in the developing Drosophila CNS 
77 
and its initial characterization in the visual system. We find that the visual system as a whole, all 15 of the 
78 
individual neuronal cell types examined, as well as astrocytic glia, participate in patterned, stimulus-
79 
independent neural activity (PSINA), during the late stages of circuit assembly. We speculate on the function of 
80 
this globally organized, cell type-specific activity in regulating the development of the connectome.

Patterned neuronal and glial activity in the developing fly brain  
84 
To assess whether neural activity contributes to visual system development in Drosophila, we used an in 
85 
vivo 2-photon live imaging protocol that enables continuous observation over several days (i.e. from ~16 hrs 
86 
after puparium formation (hAPF) to eclosion) (Akin and Zipursky, 2016; Langen et al., 2015). We expressed 
87 
the genetically-encoded calcium indicator (GECI) GCaMP6s (Chen et al., 2013) throughout the central nervous 
88 
system using a pan-neuronal GAL4 driver. Between 40 and 50 hAPF, the optic lobe is largely inactive, aside 
89 
from sporadic activity in isolated cells or groups of cells with no discernable spatial or temporal coordination 
90 
(Movie S1). Starting shortly before 50 hAPF, a subset of neuronal processes begins to exhibit periodic pulse 
91 
trains of increased fluorescence. By 55 hAPF, neuronal processes in all optic neuropils, as well as fibers 
92 
originating from the central brain, participate in regular 12-15 minute long cycles of active and silent phases 
93 
(Figures 1A-1B, Movie S1).  
94 
The active phase of each cycle comprises several distinct bouts of activity, each of which may have one 
95 
or a set of closely spaced peaks (Figure 1B). We term these bouts sweeps. Between 55 and 65 hAPF, the cycle 
96 
period remains roughly constant while the number of sweeps per cycle and the duration of the active phase 
97 
increase at the expense of a shrinking silent phase (Figure 1C). Fourier analysis captures the simple periodicity 
98 
of the activity pattern with a single dominant band for the cycle frequency (~0.001-0.002 Hz) over what we call 
99 
the periodic stage (Figure 1C). There were no significant differences between periodicity, sweeps per cycle, 
100 
active and silent phase durations between different animals, consistent with the notion that the developmental 
101 
mechanisms underlying these metrics are stereotyped (Figure S1A).  
102 
To further characterize the time evolution of the neuronal activity, we moved our expression system to 
103 
the cn,bw genetic background (Thimann and Beadle, 1937), which eliminated pigmentation in the retina and 
104 
allowed us to image through eclosion. We found no significant differences in the periodic stage activity metrics 
105 
between cn,bw flies and control flies (Figure S1A). Imaging beyond this stage revealed that by 70 hAPF the 
106 
earlier, simple temporal pattern is replaced with multiple frequencies reflecting cycles with variable periods 
107 
(Figure 1D, Movie S1). Compared to the periodic stage, during this later, turbulent stage, individual cycles 
108 
exhibit higher sweeps per cycle, and, on average, longer and shorter active and silent phase durations, 
109 
respectively (Figure 1D). The turbulent stage persists until the final hour of pupal development, after which the 
110 
number and amplitude of peaks drop before eclosion (Figure S1B). Thus, activity during development is 
111 
divided into an early periodic stage and a later turbulent stage, and continues until an hour before the adult fly 
112 
emerges (Figure 1E). 
113 
We next asked whether activity was present beyond the visual system. Recently, a detailed study of 
114 
motoneuron development showed that the neurons of the peripheral nervous system exhibit periodic bouts of 
115 
activity, starting at 48 hAPF, which grow stronger as development proceeds (Constance et al., 2018). In pupae, 
116 
the pan-neuronally driven GCaMP6s was sufficiently bright to detect using a wide field-of-view

epifluorescence microscope, making it possible to image the whole CNS of multiple animals simultaneously. 
118 
We used this alternative preparation to follow the GECI signal between 58 and 60 hAPF, and observed cycles 
119 
of activity that matched our observations from the 2-photon setup in both the optic lobes and the central brain 
120 
(Figure 2A, Movie S2). We also established that the pattern of activity is the same in males and females 
121 
(Figure S2A).  
122 
Given the broad domain of the activity, we assessed whether the glial complement of the CNS also 
123 
participate in this process. Using orthogonal expression systems, we expressed GCaMP6s in astrocytic glia and 
124 
RCaMP1b in all neurons (Figures 2B, S2B-D). Prior to 55 hAPF, there is no significant correlation between the 
125 
glial GECI signal and neuronal activity (Figure S2B). This changes markedly further into the periodic stage 
126 
when the glial signal begins periodic oscillations (Figures 2B and S2C). While, by contrast to the rapid 
127 
neuronal responses, the changes to the glial GECI signal are tonic, these cells also cycle through periods of high 
128 
and low intensity alongside neurons, albeit with a notable phase shift: when neurons are active, astrocytes 
129 
exhibit a progressive loss in GECI signal which is rebuilt during the neuronal silent phase (Figures 2B and 
130 
S2D). 
131 
As flies leave the field of view of the microscope upon eclosion, it was not possible to establish whether 
132 
the oscillatory activity ceases altogether in the adult. To address this question, we used a head-fixed cranial 
133 
window preparation of adult flies expressing GCaMP6s pan-neuronally (Aptekar et al., 2015; Seelig et al., 
134 
2010) . We observed stimulus-independent activity in newly eclosed (1 hr old) flies as well as 1- and 5-day old 
135 
adults, all of which also had intact, robust responses to visual stimuli (Figure S3A). By contrast to what we 
136 
observe during development, spontaneous activity in the adult did not engage the entire optic lobe, exhibited 
137 
fewer sweeps in a given cycle and oscillated at a higher frequency (Figure S3B). Further, with increasing age, 
138 
less activity was observed, suggesting that the mechanisms driving this regime of activity decreased over a 
139 
period of days. These differences suggest the involvement of different molecules and mechanisms in generating 
140 
the pupal and adult stimulus-independent activities. 
141 
 
142 
Calcium activity correlates with changes in membrane voltage and neurotransmitter release and is 
143 
independent of visual stimulus 
144 
The clear separation between stimulus-dependent and spontaneous GECI signals in the adult, and the 
145 
interpretation of the former as evoked neuronal activity, raises two questions about the pulses observed during 
146 
metamorphosis. First, are the pulses we observe during development reporting the electrical excitation across 
147 
neurons, or rather are they indicative of membrane activity-independent modulation of intracellular calcium 
148 
levels? And second, if the pupal pulses in the visual system do indeed reflect neuronal activity, do they depend 
149 
on visual stimuli and phototransduction?

To address whether the pupal pulses reflect neuronal activity, we first asked if the GECI signal is 
151 
accompanied by temporally matched neurotransmitter (e.g. glutamate) release and changes in membrane 
152 
voltage by co-expressing the red-shifted GECI, RCaMP1b (Dana et al., 2016), with either the genetically 
153 
encoded glutamate sensor iGluSnFR (Marvin et al., 2013) or the genetically encoded voltage indicator ArcLight 
154 
(Jin et al., 2012). Pan-neuronal co-expression of both indicator pairings revealed glutamate release and 
155 
membrane voltage dynamics that were closely correlated with the GECI signal cycles (Figures S4A-B). As 
156 
discussed below, all neuronal cell types we studied individually also display the same GECI reported activity 
157 
pattern we describe for pan-neuronal expression. As such, we constrained the source of the co-expressed 
158 
indicators to a single cell type, the L1 lamina monopolar neuron, a glutamatergic first-order interneuron (Gao et 
159 
al., 2008; Takemura et al., 2011). With L1, we observed strong correlation between the GECI signal and both 
160 
the iGluSnFR-reported glutamate release (Figure 2C, Movie S3) and ArcLight-reported drops in membrane 
161 
voltage (Figures 2D, Movie S4) at the level of individual sweeps.  
162 
To further examine the nature of the pupal pulses, we used the head-fixed cranial window preparation in 
163 
late stage pupae (90-95 hAPF) to enable pharmacological manipulations. We found that on-going calcium 
164 
activity at this stage is severely attenuated with the administration of tetrodotoxin, a voltage-gated sodium 
165 
channel blocker that inhibits action potentials (Figures 2E and S4C). Together, these results indicate that the 
166 
GECI signal observed during pupal development reflects neuronal electrical activity.  
167 
Next, we assessed the contribution of visual stimulus to developmental neuronal activity by following 
168 
the GECI signal in norpAnull animals. NorpA encodes phospholipase C, which is required in photoreceptors to 
169 
initiate signaling downstream of rhodopsin, the light-activated G-protein coupled receptor (Bloomquist et al., 
170 
1988). We confirmed that norpAnull animals are blind by testing the optomotor response to wide-field stimulus 
171 
and closed-loop bar fixation (Figure S5A-C). Returning to our calcium imaging preparation, we found that 
172 
activity was still present during pupal development (Figure 2F), although the cycle period was altered (Figure 
173 
S5D). The finding that this activity is independent of visual stimuli is consistent with the reported timing for the 
174 
onset of photoreceptor light response at 82 hAPF, which is some 27 hours after the neuronal activity begins 
175 
(Hardie et al., 1993). It is also consistent with our experimental setup in which the only light source is the 
176 
pulsed IR laser used for 2-photon excitation, which is outside of the sensitivity spectrum of fly photoreceptors 
177 
(Salcedo et al., 1999). We conclude that the pupal neuronal activity is independent of a visual stimulus. In the 
178 
remainder of the text we refer to this phenomenon as patterned, stimulus-independent neuronal activity, or 
179 
PSINA. Taken together, our observations indicate that PSINA is a globally coordinated process that involves 
180 
the entire developing CNS.

We returned to 2-photon imaging of the developing visual system to assess PSINA in specific neuronal 
184 
types. Using GCaMP6s, we followed calcium activity in 15 cell types, representing some of the major visual 
185 
system classes (i.e. photoreceptors (R7, R8), lamina monopolar neurons (L1, L3, L5), medulla intrinsic neurons 
186 
(Mi1, Mi4), distal medulla neurons (Dm3, Dm4, Dm9), transmedullary neurons (Tm3, Tm4, Tm9), and T 
187 
neurons (T4, T5)) (Figure 3A). Between 50 and 65 hAPF, the temporal pattern of PSINA in all neurons closely 
188 
followed the pan-neuronal archetype of the periodic stage; as a group, cells of a type cycled through active and 
189 
silent phases lasting 12-15 minutes, starting around 50-55 hAPF and gradually increasing the duration and the 
190 
sweep complement of the active phase over time (Figure 3B).  
191 
Whereas the broad temporal characteristics of PSINA are shared between all neuronal types, how the 
192 
activity propagates across the repeated columnar array of a given cell type varies significantly. For example, 
193 
nearly all L3 neurons participate in every sweep of an active phase while in L1s fractional participation can 
194 
change notably between sweeps (Figures 3C and 3D, Movie S5). Further, during a sweep, L3s reach peak 
195 
intensity within narrower time window compared to L1s (Figures 3C and 3D). In order to compare PSINA 
196 
dynamics between repeated observations of the same cell type and across different cell types, we defined two 
197 
scalar metrics, coordination and coherence, to represent the distributions of fractional participation and peak 
198 
time spread values, respectively. Coordination is the fraction of sweeps with greater than 90% column 
199 
participation. Coherence is the largest fraction of columns that peak within the same time point, averaged over 
200 
all sweeps. Accordingly, distinct observations of PSINA in L3s all yield comparably high coordination and 
201 
coherence values in contrast to L1, which scores consistently lower for both metrics (Figure 3E). We extended 
202 
this analysis to 13 other cell types and found that coordination and coherence values from separate observations 
203 
cluster around means characteristic to each cell type, independent of the specific drivers used for GECI 
204 
expression or transgenic constitution of the animals (Figures 3F and S6A, Movie S6). For most cell types, 
205 
coordination and coherence are roughly constant during the periodic stage, between 55-65 hAPF (Figure S6B). 
206 
In the few that do show changes, we observe loss of coordination that is attributable to loss of image quality as 
207 
developing retinal pigmentation degrades the observed GECI signal, particularly with weaker cell type-specific 
208 
drivers. A notable exception is L1; here, despite the loss of net signal, both metrics increase over time (Figure 
209 
S6B), indicating that the observed trends reflect evolving PSINA dynamics. Visual inspection of the L1 activity 
210 
pattern over time confirms this conclusion (Figures S6C-S6D). In summary, we find that the fine spatio-
211 
temporal structure of PSINA is cell type-specific, stereotyped and can be dynamic over the course of 
212 
development. 
213 
The cell type-specific diversity of PSINA dynamics suggested that the activity may be traversing the 
214 
visual system through multiple parallel ‘channels’ which engage distinct sets of neurons. To explore this notion, 
215 
we imaged pairs of neurons expressing red and green GECIs (Figure 4). For example, we compared the activity 
216 
in Tm3 transmedullary neurons, with processes in both the medulla and the lobula neuropils, to the medulla-

resident dendrites of the T4 class and the lobula-resident dendrites of T5s (Figures 4A-4D, Movie S7).  
218 
Between 55-65 hAPF, the Tm3-T4 activity was highly correlated (0.8+/-0.06, n=3) while the Tm3-T5 
219 
correlation was significantly lower (0.55+/-0.1, n=2) (Figures 4D-4E, S7A-S7B). The results were the same 
220 
when these measurements were repeated with the opposite cell type and color pairing (Figure S7C). Notably, in 
221 
the adult, Tm3 and T4 are synaptic partners in the ON-motion circuit (Takemura et al., 2013) while T5, which is 
222 
part of the OFF-motion circuit, is not a synaptic partner with Tm3 (Shinomiya et al., 2014). 
223 
Downstream of photoreceptors, L1 is considered to provide the principal input to the ON-motion circuit 
224 
(Joesch et al., 2010), with Tm3 and Mi1 as its major post-synaptic partners, which then synapse with T4 
225 
(Behnia et al., 2014; Takemura et al., 2013), the first direction selective neuron in the pathway (Maisak et al., 
226 
2014) (Figure 3A). We found that the activities of the Mi1-Tm3 and Mi1-T4 pairs are also well correlated 
227 
while L1-Tm3 has lower correlation (Figure 4E). As discussed above, the dynamics of PSINA in L1 evolve 
228 
through pupal development, and may eventually converge with a presumptive ON-motion PSINA channel 
229 
during the ensuing turbulent stage. Alternatively, if PSINA is propagated through some form of synaptic 
230 
coupling, the low L1-Tm3 correlation may be reporting on the sign of the interaction; that is, L1 could be an 
231 
inhibitory synaptic partner at this stage of development. 
232 
Returning to T5, we found that its activity is highly correlated with Tm4, an OFF-motion circuit input 
233 
into T5 in the adult (Serbe et al., 2016; Shinomiya et al., 2014) (Figure 4E). Finally, we observed highly 
234 
correlated activity between a pair of high coordination-coherence cells, L3 and Dm4 (Figure 4E), which are 
235 
also synaptic partners in the adult. Together, these results confirm the presence of multiple distinct channels of 
236 
PSINA activity.  
237 
Correlated activity patterns between many adult synaptic partners some 45 hours before the end of pupal 
238 
development hinted at the existence of an early form of synaptic pairing. To explore whether the observed 
239 
correlations depend on synaptic release, we expressed tetanus toxin (TNT) in one cell type of a pair and 
240 
measured the correlation of the PSINA activities as before. Driving TNT expression in Tm3s reduced the 
241 
correlation of the Tm3-T4 pair significantly while the Tm3-T5 value was unaffected (Figure 4F). By contrast, 
242 
T4 expression of TNT had no effect on the Tm3-T4 correlation (Figure 4F). These results indicate that the 
243 
coordinated PSINA activity in Tm3 and T4 is dependent on synaptic release from Tm3, consistent with the 
244 
notion that PSINA propagation is achieved through some form of synaptic coupling.

Discussion 
247 
In summary, here we report the discovery and initial characterization of PSINA in the developing fly 
248 
visual system. We observe three distinct stages of PSINA: a periodic stage between 55 and 65 hAPF, a turbulent 
249 
stage lasting from 70 hAPF to the final hour of pupal development, and an adult stage that persists alongside 
250 
mature stimulus responses through at least the first four days following eclosion. During the periodic stage,

which coincides with the onset of synaptogenesis in the fly CNS (Chen et al., 2014; Muthukumar et al., 2014), 
252 
each neuronal cell type of the 15 analyzed exhibited stereotyped and distinct activity patterns. Many adult 
253 
synaptic partners had correlated activity, which depended on synaptic release.  
254 
Distinct periodic calcium dynamics were also seen in astrocytes. Astrocytes in the developing adult 
255 
brain elaborate processes which infiltrate the neuropil during synapse formation (Muthukumar et al., 2014). 
256 
Ablating astrocytes leads to a significant reduction in the total synapse count (32-47%, depending on the region) 
257 
in the brain, supporting a role for these cells in regulating synaptogenesis (Muthukumar et al., 2014). Astrocytes 
258 
of the optic neuropils also elaborate their processes over the same time period (Richier et al., 2017). Here we 
259 
report that astrocytes exhibit cycles of GECI signal that are matched, though offset, to the periodic PSINA. 
260 
These findings raise the possibility that astrocytes, spontaneous activity in them, and PSINA contribute to the 
261 
formation, specificity, or maturation of synapses within the visual system.   
262 
What is the contribution of PSINA to building a brain? The best characterized system are retinal waves, 
263 
which drive the activity of retinal ganglion cells (RGCs), the exclusive conduit of information from the eyes to 
264 
the brain. Here, RGC projections from both eyes target the LGN and the SC, where they create retinotopic maps 
265 
of the visual field and segregate based on the eye of origin. In the mouse, retinal waves are described in three 
266 
stages: The gap-junction mediated stage I from embryonic day 17 (E17) to post-natal day 1 (P1), the 
267 
‘cholinergic’ stage II between P1-P10, and the ‘glutamatergic’ stage III from P10 to eye opening at P14 
268 
(Blankenship and Feller, 2009; Sernagor and Hennig, 2013). Retinotopy and eye-specific segregation in the 
269 
LGN and SC are refined over the same period as the second stage of retinal waves. This cholinergic stage is 
270 
driven by starburst amacrine cells (SACs) (Zheng et al., 2006, 2004). Early work in the field established that 
271 
pharmacological manipulation of spontaneous activity in the retina disrupts the organization of RGC projections 
272 
in the LGN (Shatz and Stryker, 1988; Sretavan et al., 1988). Later studies, using progressively more refined 
273 
methods, have shown that disrupting the cholinergic circuit of SACs and RGCs largely eliminates retinal waves 
274 
and leads to defects in the refinement of retinotopy and eye-specific segregation of RGC projections (Bansal et 
275 
al., 2000; Burbridge et al., 2014; McLaughlin et al., 2003; and others). In brief, retinal waves are necessary for 
276 
the correct patterning of RGC projections in the brain.  
277 
Five classes of neurons comprise the retina: Photoreceptors, bipolar cells, amacrine cells, horizontal 
278 
cells, and retinal ganglion cells (RGCs). The diversity of cell types within these classes—as many as 30 for 
279 
RGCs (Sanes and Masland, 2015)—is comparable to the fly visual system. Whether there is cell type-specific 
280 
texture to the retinal waves similar to PSINA described here is not known, although broad classes of RGCs and 
281 
cone bipolar cells have been shown to exhibit temporally offset firing patterns (Akrouh and Kerschensteiner, 
282 
2013; Kerschensteiner and Wong, 2008) With improving genetic handles for distinct retinal cell types and 
283 
ongoing efforts at describing the high resolution connectome, it will be possible to explore cell type-specific 
284 
patterns and the contribution of retinal waves to retinal circuitry (Seung and Sümbül, 2014).

In Drosophila, peristaltic contractions of body wall muscles have recently been appreciated as part of 
286 
broad neuronal activity during embryonic development (Vonhoff and Keshishian, 2016). This activity is similar 
287 
to PSINA observed during pupal development with respect to periodicity and timing relative to synapse 
288 
formation and refinement. Preventing motor neurons from participating in this neuronal activity, or disrupting 
289 
calcium-dependent intracellular signaling results in ectopic synapses (Carrillo et al., 2010; Jarecki and 
290 
Keshishian, 1995; Vonhoff and Keshishian, 2016). In the wildtype, the calcium transients in motor neurons are 
291 
thought to enable synaptic pruning in response to the muscle-derived chemorepellent Sema2a (Vonhoff and 
292 
Keshishian, 2016). A similar link between spontaneous activity and axon guidance has also been demonstrated 
293 
in the developing mammalian visual system. Here, oscillatory Ca2+ activity in RGCs were shown to be required 
294 
for the ephrin-A5 dependent re-positioning of RGC projections in the SC in ex vivo cultures (Nicol et al., 2007). 
295 
These observations from the fly and the mouse suggest that axon guidance and, more broadly, neuronal 
296 
morphogenesis may be common effectors of spontaneous activity during brain development. 
297 
Based on the studies we reference here, previous studies in the fly visual system, and of the role of 
298 
spontaneous activity in other systems, we propose a general conceptual framework for the role of PSINA in 
299 
regulating the assembly of the adult connectome. Here, we provide evidence to suggest that some adult synaptic 
300 
pairings are already established by 55 hAPF, soon after the first pre-synapses can be detected and co-incident 
301 
with the onset of periodic PSINA. The global coordination of PSINA indicates that an early connectome, one 
302 
that must be built without activity, is present at this time. This early connectome, comprising the processes of 
303 
over 100 different neuronal cell types, would be built through local, largely contact-dependent biochemical 
304 
interactions. While the level of organization achieved through such mechanisms is astonishing, the early 
305 
connectome may still be a rough approximation of what is required in the adult. PSINA, by orchestrating 
306 
cellular communication at temporal and spatial scales inaccessible to other signaling mechanisms, may be 
307 
acting to refine this first draft to complete the self-assembly of the brain. Sweeps of activity repeatedly coursing 
308 
through the brain through different ‘channels’ could link distinct sets of neurons to direct coordinated 
309 
morphological changes and sculpt cell-cell contacts, strengthen synapses with correct targets while weakening 
310 
and pruning incorrect pairings, and control transcription programs that direct circuit refinement (Lee et al., 
311 
2017; Nakashima et al., 2013; Serizawa et al., 2006; Tyssowski et al., 2018). PSINA may act as a ‘dress 
312 
rehearsal’ for neural networks, preparing for ‘opening night’ at the completion of development. Individual cells 
313 
know their own lines, with whom they interact, and their respective positions on the stage; however, repeated 
314 
practice of each scene is necessary to refine interactions and ensure that each of the cast can perform as part of a 
315 
whole ensemble. 
316 
We find it remarkable that as a process that appears to engage most, if not all, of the CNS, PSINA is the 
317 
collective output of the genetically hardwired developmental programs of individual neurons. Thus, despite its 
318 
complexity, the organizing principles, the driving forces, and the functional significance of PSINA at the level

of circuits, cells, and molecules should be discoverable through genetic analysis. Undertaking this effort in the 
320 
fly visual system, where structures analogous to the vertebrate retinal plexiforms, the LGN, and the SC (Sanes 
321 
and Zipursky, 2010) are compactly organized in a single microscopic field of view and for which the EM-
322 
derived connectome is available, may yield valuable insights into whether and how PSINA affects synaptic 
323 
specificity and circuit maturation. We expect that the ever-expanding genetic toolkit of Drosophila, 
324 
complemented with improvements in genomic/transcriptomic analysis and imaging technology, will offer a 
325 
robust experimental track toward understanding PSINA’s contribution to brain development and function.

Experimental Model and Subject Details 
580 
Flies were reared at 18°C or 25°C on standard cornmeal/molasses medium. Pupal development was staged with 
581 
respect to white pre-pupa formation (0 hAPF) or head eversion (12 hAPF). The GAL4/UAS and LexA/LexAop 
582 
expression systems (Brand and Perrimon, 1993; Lai and Lee, 2006) were used to drive cell type-specific 
583 
transgene expression; complete genotypes used in each experiment can be found in Table S1. 
584 
 
585 
Method Details 
586 
2P Imaging of the Developing Visual System 
587 
Pupae were prepared for imaging as previously described (Akin and Zipursky, 2016). Briefly, the cuticle around 
588 
the heads were removed with fine forceps and the animals were attached eye-down on a coverslip coated with a 
589 
thin layer of embryo glue. A water reservoir on the objective side of the coverglass provided sufficient 
590 
immersion medium to last through the hours-long imaging sessions; another reservoir below the pupae kept the 
591 
animals from dehydrating.  
592 
Time-lapse imaging of the visual system was carried out on a custom-built 2P microscope (Akin and 
593 
Zipursky, 2016) equipped with a 20x water immersion objective (Zeiss, W Plan-Apochromat 10x/1.0 DIC) and 
594 
2 GaAsP detectors (Hamamatsu). Over the 2-24 hr imaging sessions, the pupae were kept at 25°C using an 
595 
objective heater system (Bioptechs). A tunable Ti:Sapphire pulsed laser (Chameleon Ultra II, Coherent) was 
596 
used as the light source. Green fluors were excited at 940 or 970 nm with ~30 mW under-the-objective power; 
597 
1020 nm at ~60 mW was used for red fluors and two-color imaging. Animals imaged under these conditions 
598 
developed normally and eclosed on schedule.  To observe a thicker cross-section of the visual system than 
599 
possible with a single optical slice, we used the maximum intensity projection of three successive images taken 
600 
2 μm apart in the z-axis as the frame for an individual time point. Thus, the effective sampling rate of these time 
601 
series was 0.4 Hz (2.5s per frame). 
602 
Wide-field Imaging 
603 
Pupae were staged for head eversion and reared at 25ºC. At 58-60 hAPF, pupae were affixed to a Sylgard 184 
604 
Silicone Elastomer plate (Dow Corning) with double-stick adhesive tape (3M). Images were acquired with a

SteREO Discovery.V8 stereomicroscope (Zeiss) with illumination provided by an X-Cite Series 120PC light 
606 
source (Excelitas) and captured on a Vixia HF R20 1/4.85 inch CMOS camera (Canon). Images were acquired 
607 
at 30 Hz. Time series were processed with Fiji (ImageJ) (Schindelin et al., 2012) and analyzed using MATLAB 
608 
(Mathworks, Natick, MA, USA). 
609 
Adult Functional Imaging 
610 
Calcium imaging was performed as previously described (Keleş and Frye, 2017). Briefly, a single fly was 
611 
anesthetized at 4°C and placed into a chemically etched metal shim attached to a custom 3D-printed holder. 
612 
Holder design was based on (Weir et al., 2016); details can be found at http://ptweir.github.io/flyHolder/. The 
613 
head capsule and thorax were glued to the metal shim using a UV-curable glue (www.esslinger.com). Legs and 
614 
the antennae were immobilized using beeswax applied with a heated metal probe (Waxelectric-1, Renfert). The 
615 
head capsule was bathed in saline (103mM NaCl, 3mM KCl, 1.5mM CaCl2, 4mM MgCl2, 26mM NaHCO3, 
616 
1mM NaH2PO4, 10mM trehalose, 10mM glucose, 5mM TES, 2mM sucrose) and a small window was opened 
617 
using fine forceps (Dumont, #5SF). Muscles and fat covering the optic lobe were cleared before placing the fly 
618 
under a 2P microscope (3i, Denver, CO). Neurons expressing GCaMP6s were imaged at 920 nm using a 
619 
Ti:Sapphire pulse laser (Chameleon Vision, Coherent). Images were acquired at 10 Hz.  
620 
An arena of 48 8x8 LED matrices (470 nm, Adafruit) was used to deliver the visual stimulus. Three 
621 
layers of blue filter (Rosco no. 59 Indigo) were placed between the screen and the fly to eliminate leakage of the 
622 
LED light into the PMTs. The screen extended ±108° along the azimuth and ± 72° in elevation. Each LED pixel 
623 
corresponded to a coverage of 2.2° on the retina equator. However, the projection of each pixel on the retina 
624 
was variable due to the difference between the curvature of the eye and that of the screen. Visual stimulus 
625 
consisted of a wide-field grating with a spatial frequency of 35° and presented at a temporal frequency of 0.62 
626 
Hz in both directions (ipsi-to-contra and contra-to-ipsi) along the horizontal axis. The presentation order of the 
627 
visual stimuli was randomized to prevent sensory adaptation. Each experimental condition was tested three to 
628 
four times per animal.  
629 
Tetrodotoxin Treatment 
630 
Pupal development was staged for white pre-pupa formation and reared at 25ºC. Between 90-95 hAPF, the 
631 
pupal case was removed with fine forceps. These late pupae were prepared for imaging following the protocol 
632 
described above for adult functional imaging. Viability was verified by leg or trachea movement. Neurons 
633 
expressing GCaMP6s were imaged at 920 nm using a Ti:Sapphire pulsed laser (Chameleon Vision, Coherent). 
634 
Images were acquired at 10 Hz. 
635 
 
Tetrodotoxin at 1μM final concentration was mixed into the saline solution after 40 minutes of imaging 
636 
and the fly was observed for another 20 minutes after the application of the drug. Viability was confirmed 
637 
before and after tetrodotoxin administration, and the data were excluded from analysis if the animal did not 
638 
survive the experiment.

Visual Flight Simulator 
640 
Flies were cold anesthetized at 4°C, tethered to tungsten pins using UV activated glue, and allowed to recover 
641 
for 1-2 hours in a small, humidified acrylic container with a red desk lamp providing heat. This recovery regime 
642 
improves flight performance consistency. The majority of the experiments were performed in the afternoon 
643 
when flies are most active.  
644 
A visual flight simulator composed of 32x96 cylindrical green (570 nm) LEDs was used to deliver 
645 
visual stimuli (Reiser and Dickinson, 2008). The arena covered ± 180° along the azimuth and ± 60° in 
646 
elevation. Single flies were positioned in the center of the arena and illuminated from above with an 880 nm 
647 
infrared LED. The shadow cast by the wings was detected with an optical sensor. Signal form this sensor was 
648 
analyzed by an instrument called the wingbeat analyzer (JFI Electronics Laboratory, University of. 
649 
Chicago, Chicago, IL, USA) that calculates left and right wing beat amplitudes (WBA). The difference in the 
650 
left and right WBA is proportional to the fly’s steering effort in the yaw axis.  
651 
For bar fixation closed-loop experiments, a dark bar that is 120° in height and 30° in width was 
652 
presented to the flies. Positional displacement of the bar in the yaw axis was coupled to the steering effort of the 
653 
fly, allowing the animal to have the active control of the bar position. Each fly was tested for closed-loop 
654 
fixation behavior for four minutes. To test open-loop optomotor responses, flies were presented with wide-field 
655 
gratings with a spatial frequency of 30° and a temporal frequency of 3 Hz for four seconds.  
656 
 
657 
Quantification and Statistical Analysis 
658 
Analysis of Pupal Imaging Data 
659 
Pre-processing: Processing and analysis of image data were carried out with custom scripts written in 
660 
MATLAB (Mathworks, Natick, MA, USA). Fiji (ImageJ) was used for some user-assisted tasks and figure 
661 
preparation. Time series were processed in blocks corresponding to ~6 hours of observation (~9000 frames). In 
662 
the pre-processing step of reducing lateral motion, the general approach of maximizing the cross correlation of 
663 
individual frames to a reference image was modified to meet the specific challenges of developmental imaging. 
664 
First, a series of reference images were generated as averages of pools of high signal frames distributed across 
665 
each block. After ~55 hAPF, the optic lobes begin to twitch with a period similar to that of PSINA. These fast 
666 
movements can introduce significant blur into the pool-averaged reference images. To reduce this blur, 300 
667 
random subsets of each pool were tested to find the sharpest average reference image. Sequential registration of 
668 
this series of reference images to each other produced a stabilized representation of the visual system which 
669 
continues to move and grow over the course of observation (Akin and Zipursky, 2016; Langen et al., 2015). In a 
670 
second step, the registration of the reference series was refined to minimize the movement of a user defined 
671 
region of interest (ROI). These internally registered reference images then served as local registration targets for 
672 
nearby frames of the full block. Finally, the block was corrected for any rotational motion of the ROI.

Signal and Feature Extraction: Per frame pixel averages of masked regions were used to define raw signal (F) 
674 
traces from the image time series. Time-dependent fluorescence baseline (Fo) was estimated using a moving 
675 
window approach and used to calculate the net signal (F-Fo, Figures 3 and 4) and change-in-signal ((F-Fo)/ Fo, 
676 
Figures 1 and 2) traces. User-defined, static masks were used for pan-neuronal and glial expression 
677 
experiments. For cell type-specific experiments, dynamic masks, corresponding to the active columns in each 
678 
cycle, were defined automatically from the kymograph representation of the time series. Briefly, kymographs 
679 
were generated as concatenated line profiles from user-defined, segmented arcs of 7-9 pixel (3-4 μm) thickness, 
680 
drawn across a single layer of the medulla or lobula neuropil. Baseline subtracted, net signal kymographs were 
681 
used in all subsequent analysis. Projecting along the spatial dimension of the kymographs yielded one 
682 
dimensional net signal traces, which were used to identify the limits of PSINA cycles. Within each active phase, 
683 
sweeps were defined by ordering intensity peaks with respect to their amplitudes, and, from the largest peak on 
684 
down, marking the continuous time spans with net signal intensity greater than 75% of peak value; lesser peaks 
685 
present in the sweep of a larger one were removed from the ordered peak list used in sweep identification. 
686 
Dynamic masks were based on peaks in the activity profiles of PSINA cycles, produced for each active phase 
687 
by projecting along the temporal dimension of the kymographs. The width of each mask was determined by 
688 
testing the spatial neighborhood of each peak for correlated net intensity changes in the time domain. The 
689 
maximum number of dynamic masks identified in each cycle was set to 20.  
690 
Frequency Analysis: Analysis was implemented in MATLAB, following the guidelines of Uhlen (Uhlén, 2004). 
691 
Change-in-signal (∆F/F) traces were processed using a 2-hour sliding window which traversed the time series in 
692 
1-hour steps. After filtering with a Hanning window to reduce spectral leakage, each 2-hour block was 
693 
transformed with the FFT algorithm to obtain non-parametric power spectrum density estimates. The fidelity of 
694 
the power spectrum density estimate was confirmed by applying the inverse transform on the highest-power 
695 
peak and comparing the resultant signal to the raw data. One-sided power spectrum density estimates were 
696 
plotted for each 2-hour block in Figure 1 and Figure S2. 
697 
PSINA Dynamics: For each cycle, unit signal-to-noise (S2N) value was defined as twice the standard deviation 
698 
of the net signal trace in the silent phase. A dynamically masked column was considered to participate in a 
699 
given sweep if it had a net intensity peak greater than or equal to 1.0 S2N within the sweep limits. This scoring 
700 
scheme was the basis of the definition of the coordination metric. For coherence, the largest fraction of columns 
701 
that reach peak intensity at the same time point within each sweep was calculated. To ensure consistent 
702 
comparisons across different cell types, only high participation (≥90%) sweeps were considered for the 
703 
coherence metric. 
704 
Correlation Analysis: For the analysis of two-color imaging experiments, two separate kymographs were 
705 
generated using the same segmented arc. Dynamic masks were derived from the average activity profile of 
706 
these two kymographs to ensure that the masks captured columns active in both channels. Cycle limits were

determined using the brighter channel. For each cycle, masks with a maximum S2N value of at least 1.0 in both 
708 
channels were used to calculate pairwise 0-lag cross-correlation. Cycles with fewer than 10 masks above the 
709 
signal quality threshold were excluded in the calculation of time series ensemble statistics (i.e. mean and 
710 
standard deviation.) 
711 
Analysis of Adult Calcium Imaging Data 
712 
Images were pre-processed to correct for lateral motion using the registration algorithm described above. To 
713 
find active pixels in the lobula, we defined a mask excluding other neuropils (medulla and lobula plate). For 
714 
every pixel in this mask, the mean value and standard deviation were calculated for the full time series; the test 
715 
value for each pixel was defined as the product of these metrics. Pixels with test values greater than or equal to 
716 
twice the mean value of all pixels in the mask were used in analysis. In our experience, this thresholding 
717 
approach enriches for active pixels over background and shot noise in the selected mask. The frame average of 
718 
active pixels were used to produce the signal trace for the time series. Repeated observations were averaged for 
719 
each fly and a single average trace per experiment was generated.  
720 
Analysis of Visual Fixation Behavior 
721 
Behavioral data from the visual display and the wing beat analyzer was collected with a Digidata 1440A 
722 
digitizer (Molecular Devices, San Jose, CA, USA) sampled at 1 kHz. Data were processed using custom written 
723 
scripts in MATLAB (Mathworks, Natick, MA, USA). Briefly, the first 100 milliseconds of the trials were 
724 
removed and the first data point of the remaining signal was subtracted from the entire trial to set the initial 
725 
WBA to zero. Delta WBA was calculated by subtracting left from right WBA. Flies which stopped flying 
726 
during the experiments were excluded from further analysis. Trials for the same experimental conditions were 
727 
averaged and calculated for all animals. No statistical tests were conducted to pre-determine the sample size. To 
728 
analyze closed-loop fixation data, the bar position was binned into 96 positions around the visual azimuth and 
729 
bar histograms for each fly was calculated. Data were then averaged across the animals for the time bar spent at 
730 
each position.
