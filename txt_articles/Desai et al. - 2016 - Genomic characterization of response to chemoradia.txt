Abstract
Background—This study characterized the genetic landscape of chemoradiation treated 
urothelial carcinoma of the bladder (UCB), with the goal of identifying potential correlates of 
response.
Methods—Primary tumors with (n=8) or without (n=40) matched recurrent tumor from 48 non-
metastatic high grade UCB patients treated primarily with chemoradiation were analyzed using a 
next-generation sequencing assay enriched for cancer-related and canonical DNA damage 
response (DDR) genes. Protein expression of MRE11, a previously suggested biomarker, was 
assessed in 44 patients. We compared recurrent to primary tumors and evaluated clinical impact of 
likely deleterious DDR gene alterations.
Results—The profile of alterations approximated that of prior UCB cohorts. Within 5 pairs of 
matched primary-recurrent tumors, a median of 92% of somatic mutations was shared. A median 
33% of mutations were shared between 3 matched bladder-metastasis pairs. Of 26 (54%) patients 
with DDR gene alterations, 12 (25%) harbored likely deleterious alterations. In multivariable 
analysis, these patients displayed a trend towards reduced bladder recurrence [hazard ratio (HR) 
0.32; p=0.070] or any recurrence [HR 0.37; p=0.070]. The most common such alteration, ERCC2 
mutations were associated with significantly lower 2-year metastatic recurrence (0% vs. 43%; log-
rank p=0.044). We detected no impact of MRE11 protein expression on outcome.
Conclusions—A similar mutation profile between primary and recurrent tumors implies that 
pre-existing, resistant clonal populations represent the primary mechanism of chemoradiation 
treatment failure. Deleterious DDR genetic alterations, particularly recurrent alterations in 
ERCC2, may be associated with improved UCB chemoradiation outcomes. A small sample size 
necessitates independent validation of these observations.

Introduction
Transurethral resection of bladder tumor (TURBT) followed by chemoradiation (CRT) is an 
effective bladder-preservation alternative to chemotherapy and radical cystectomy (RC) for 
selected muscle-invasive bladder cancer (MBIC) patients 1-5. However, incomplete treatment 
response requiring immediate cystectomy and disease-related mortality occur in ∼30% of 
patients 6, 7. Further, theoretical concerns about “field cancerization” in UCB would imply 
inevitable local relapse following bladder preservation. Improved understanding of the 
biologic basis for chemoradiation response would help address its current poor acceptance.

 Ionizing radiation induces cell death primarily through DNA double-strand breaks (DSB). 
Activation of the DNA-damage response (DDR) pathway by DSBs begins with recruitment 
of the MRE11-RAD50-NBS1 complex and ATM 8. Genes involved in this process include 
BRCA1, BRCA2, and PALB2 (homologous recombination, HR), FANCD2 and BRIP1 
(Fanconi Anemia pathway), and mediators of non-homologous end joining (NHEJ). 
Concurrent CRT is superior to radiotherapy alone 3. DNA cross-links induced by cisplatin 
are repaired primarily via the nucleotide excision repair (NER) pathway, which includes 
ERCC2 9, a gene altered more frequently in urothelial carcinoma (12%) than in other 
malignancies analyzed by The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) and associated with improved 
response to cisplatin-based chemotherapy 10.
Two studies assayed protein expression of mediators of DSB repair 11, 12 in UCB. Both 
studies correlated lowest quartile MRE11 expression and worse cancer-specific survival 
(CSS) in patients treated with RT or CRT but not surgery. The mechanistic basis for this 
observation remains unclear.
We hypothesized that molecular characterization of UCB chemoradiation patients with a 
focus on DDR alterations could identify correlates of treatment response and in-bladder 
tumor recurrence.
Methods
Sample collection and DNA preparation
Frozen and formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded (FFPE) tumor tissue was collected from 
patients with non-metastatic UCB treated with curative intent radiation or chemoradiation 
under IRB approved protocols. Pathologic review, germline control details and clinical 
annotation for each case are listed in Supplementary Tables 1-2. A representative H&E slide 
was reviewed by a board-certified genitourinary pathologist (H.A.A) to confirm histology. 
DNA was extracted from macro-dissected tissue as previously described 13.
Targeted capture and sequencing
Protein-coding exons of 341 cancer-associated genes were sequenced using an institutional 
capture-based sequencing assay (Memorial Sloan Kettering-Integrated Molecular Profiling 
of Actionable Cancer Targets, MSK-IMPACT) 14, with one modification: exons of 20 
additional genes were added to enrich for canonical DDR pathways (Supplementary Table 
3) 15. The two NimbleGen (Roche) panels were combined for capture proportionally by 
target territory and subjected to barcoding, capture, and sequencing on an Illumina HiSeq 
2500 system as 2×100bp paired-end reads, as previously described13, 16. In one patient 
(DMP-RT1), the unmodified MSK-IMPACT assay was employed.
Sequence analysis
Sequence reads were aligned to the reference human genome (hg19) using the CASAVA 
(Illumina) pipeline, the Burrows-Wheeler Alignment tool v0.6.2, and GATK. Single-
nucleotide variants were called using MuTect v1.0.27783 and indels using the 
SomaticIndelDetector tool 16. All candidate mutations and indels were reviewed manually

 (SNS). Minimum variant frequency to call an alteration was 2%. For copy number analysis 
in patients with matched germline DNA, the sequence coverage for each exon was compared 
in tumor and matched germline sample, following sample-wide LOESS (local regression) 
normalization for GC percentage and global differences in “on-target” sequence coverage. 
Changes in the tumor-to-germline coverage ratios were used to infer copy number 
alterations. Coverage ratios ≥2 or ≤0.5 were defined as amplifications or deletions, 
respectively.
We chose to include 6 patients without matched germline DNA (insufficient DNA/poor 
coverage) given the small cohort size. Somatic mutations in those patients were called after 
removing germline SNVs reported in dbSNP 17, the 1000 Genomes Project 18 and pooled 
normal from the other patients. Remaining SNVs in these patients with variant frequencies 
∼50% were subjected to manual literature searches to rule out germline origin.
Statistical analysis
Given the unclear functional impact of many DDR gene alterations, correlation with clinical 
characteristics was focused on alterations likely to be deleterious. These were defined as 
nonsense, frameshift, or splice site mutations, or missense alterations at recurrent sites 
associated with chemotherapy response in prior work. Only ERCC2 was demonstrated to 
harbor such missense alterations, occurring at or near previously reported recurrent 
alteration sites within UCB 19, 20 or associated with chemotherapy response 10, as discussed 
further in the results. Bivariate comparisons of mutation frequency were performed using 
Fisher's exact test and comparisons of means with ANOVA testing.
Analyzed clinical endpoints were time to bladder recurrence (superficial or MIBC), 
metastatic recurrence, and any recurrence, as measured from the end of radiotherapy. 
Censoring was performed at last follow up or death. Bladder intact survival was not 
analyzed because not all patients were medically able to undergo salvage cystectomy. 
Kaplan-Meier method was used to estimate cumulative probability of each event, and the 
log-rank statistic tested differences between groups. Hazard ratios and confidence intervals 
were estimated using Cox regression. Analyses were conducted using SPSS v. 20 (IBM) and 
R software version 3.2.1 (R Core Development Team, Vienna, Austria). An alpha of 0.05 
was used to define statistical significance, with two-sided testing.
Genomic and associated clinicopathologic data are publically available through the MSKCC 
cBioPortal (www.cbioportal.com) 21.
MRE11 assays
MRE11 immunohistochemistry (IHC) was performed on 4μM thick FFPE tissue sections 
using 2 different primary antibodies: mouse monoclonal Abcam [12D7] (Cat. No. ab214) 
and rabbit polyclonal #59-10 (Petrini laboratory, Sloan Kettering Institute, New York, NY). 
Staining was performed with the Discovery XT Automated System with DAB Map kit 
detection system with the appropriate secondary antibodies (Ventana Medical Systems, 
Tucson, AZ). Ab214 was used in 2 prior bladder cancer radiotherapy response studies 11, 12, 
while #59-10 was validated using positive and negative controls from an ERBB2 driven 
neoplasm in MRE11WT/WT and hypomorphic MRE11ATLD1/ATLD1 mouse models

 (Supplementary Figure 1) 22. Two pathologists (HAA, JH) used the semi-quantitative score 
(SQS) from prior biomarker studies of MRE11 (median % positive cells multiplied by modal 
intensity) to score samples.
Results
We identified 48 evaluable patients with radiotherapy or CRT treated UCB at our institution 
between 1994 and 2014. Baseline clinical and treatment data are summarized in Table 1. 
Triple modality therapy consisting of TURBT and CRT was prioritized; however, the typical 
co-morbidities and age of a UCB CRT population contributed to treatment heterogeneity. 
Thirty-one patients (71%) underwent visibly complete TURBT prior to treatment. Only 
three (6%) patients were deemed unsuitable for chemotherapy, while the remainder received 
chemoradiation (n=23, 48%) or neoadjuvant chemotherapy followed by chemoradiation 
(n=22, 46%). Twenty-four patients (50%) received platinum chemotherapy (22 neoadjuvant, 
9 concurrent), while gemcitabine (n=20) or paclitaxel (n=1) based concurrent CRT was 
administered to 21 (44%) patients. Post-treatment cystoscopy evaluation was performed in 
40/48 patients (83%). Details of chemotherapy regimen, radiotherapy, and outcome are 
provided in Supplementary Table 1.
Targeted sequencing with MSK-IMPACT was performed on 56 tumors from 48 patients, 
including 5 primary-bladder recurrence pairs, 2 primary-metastasis pairs, and 1 bladder 
recurrence-metastasis pair (Supplementary Table 2). In 42/48 patients, germline DNA was 
available from peripheral blood or uninvolved tissue. Sufficient pre-treatment tumor tissue 
from diagnostic TURBT was available in 44/48 patients. In 4 patients, however, only locally 
recurrent tumor was analyzable. Average sequencing depth was 372×. The median number 
of somatic mutations per sample was 9 (range 1-34).
The most common alterations observed in this cohort are depicted in Figure 1. The alteration 
pattern was similar to those reported in treatment-naïve samples analyzed by TCGA and in 
an 89 patient UCB cohort treated with RC +/- chemotherapy from our institution 13. For 
instance, chromatin-modifying genes including ARID1A, KMT2D, and KDM6A were 
commonly mutated (Supplementary Figure 2A), and the prevalence of alterations within 
kinase signaling pathways was not substantially different (Supplementary Figure 2B).
Twenty-six (54%) patients harbored DDR gene non-synonymous alterations (52 mutations 
in 20 genes), as illustrated in Figure 2A. Eight (15%) were truncating (nonsense, splice site, 
or frameshift alterations). Most DDR missense alterations (28/44, 64%) were not previously 
reported in a query of the Catalogue Of Somatic Mutations In Cancer (COSMIC), a 
literature search, or screening against a pan-cancer hotspot analysis of 11,119 tumors 23. 
These are of unclear significance. Thus, we focused on alterations likely to be deleterious to 
function, as previously defined. Deleterious truncating mutations (ATM n=2, BRCA1 n=2, 
BRIP1 n=1, FANCD2 n=1, PALB2 n=1, RAD50 n=1) or missense alterations (ERCC2, n=6) 
satisfying our criteria were noted in 12 patients (25%, Figure 2B and Supplementary Table 
4). ERCC2 was the only DDR gene with missense alterations detected in multiple patients 
that have also been previously linked to chemotherapy response in UCB. Figure 2C 
illustrates the close relationship of the ERCC2 alterations noted in the current cohort as

 compared to recurrently altered sites.. Deleterious DDR alterations were associated with a 
higher tumor mutation burden (mean 18.8 vs. 8.7 mutations; ANOVA p<0.001).
We evaluated the association of these deleterious DDR alterations with bladder recurrence 
(24 events), metastatic recurrence (22 events), and any recurrence (28 events). We did not 
analyze CSS, due to an insufficient number of events (n=13). Median follow up of surviving 
patients was 26 months (range 5-115). Nearly half of bladder recurrences were ≤T1 (10/24, 
42%), with 50% remaining disease-free following TURBT. Salvage cystectomy was 
required for MIBC recurrence in 8 patients.
On univariable analysis, the presence of a DDR deleterious alteration corresponded to a 
trend towards reduced cumulative incidence of bladder recurrence (2-year cumulative 
incidence 28% vs. 63%, p=0.071) or any recurrence (2-year cumulative incidence 36% vs. 
63%, p=0.067; Supplementary Figure 3). Given the known influence of clinical stage and 
complete TURBT prior to therapy, we further examined the prognostic effect of DDR 
deleterious alterations in a multivariable model (Table 2). This demonstrated again a trend 
towards reduced risk of bladder recurrence (hazard ratio, HR 0.32, 95% CI 0.10-1.10; 
p=0.070), metastatic recurrence (HR 0.35, 95% CI 0.10-1.20; p=0.094), and any recurrence 
(HR 0.37, 95% CI 0.13-1.08; p=0.070) in patients with deleterious DDR mutations.
Patient outcomes according to each deleteriously altered DDR gene are detailed in 
Supplementary Table 4. Recurrences (any site) were noted in those with ATM (2/2), BRIP1 
(1/1), FANCD2 (1/1), and RAD50 (1/1) deleterious alterations. In contrast, only one of 8 
patients with deleterious alterations in ERCC2, BRCA1, or PALB2 experienced a recurrence 
(bladder). ERCC2 alterations were associated with lower 2-year cumulative incidence of 
bladder recurrence (20% vs. 55%, p=0.154), metastatic recurrence (0% vs. 43%, p=0.044), 
and any recurrence (20% vs. 61%, p=0.085) in univariable analysis. Only one of the 6 
patients with ERCC2 missense alterations recurred, with a T1 lesion successfully treated by 
TURBT. The cohort size and the genomic heterogeneity of bladder cancers prohibited 
multivariable modeling of the specific contribution of ERCC2 or other genes.
Prior investigations have identified a correlation between low MRE11 protein expression 
and worse outcomes in radiotherapy treated UCB patients 11, 12. We sought to validate this 
finding in 44/48 of our patients with sufficient tissue for MRE11 IHC. Using two different 
antibodies (Abcam ab214 and #59-10), we found no correlation between any outcome 
measure and quartile cut-offs of MRE11 SQS (all p>0.5). We also observed a poor 
correlation in SQS between the two different antibodies (Supplementary Figure 1C, R2 = 
0.068).
Lastly, in order to better understand treatment failure, we compared the mutation profiles of 
bladder recurrence tumors to their paired pre-treatment primary bladder tumors in 5 patients. 
We found that a median of 92% (range, 74-100%) of mutations was shared between the pre- 
and post-treatment bladder tumors. Alterations unique to the bladder recurrences were rare 
(mean 4%, range 0-16% of a patient's alterations). The relative allele frequencies of 
alterations remained generally the same (Figure 3A and Supplementary Table 5.) The same 
analysis was carried out in 3 patients with paired bladder tumors and distant metastases

 (Figure 3B and Supplementary Table 6; median 33% mutations shared, range 14-44%; mean 
41% of alterations unique to the metastasis).
Discussion
Chemoradiation is an effective bladder preservation strategy for selected UCB patients; 
however, uncertainties in predicting response and physician biases have limited its 
widespread use. In the present study, we characterized the genetic landscape of tumors from 
patients who underwent primarily definitive CRT, with the goal of identifying correlates of 
response and mechanisms of treatment failure.
While most patients in our cohort harbored DDR pathway alterations, only a small fraction 
were functionally deleterious based upon pre-defined criteria. Subsequently, we included 
only truncating mutations and recurrent missense alterations at or near sites previously 
linked to chemotherapy response (only seen in ERCC2 in this cohort) within our exploratory 
analysis of the prognostic impact of DDR pathway alterations. We found a trend towards 
reduced cumulative incidence of bladder recurrence and any recurrence in the 25% of 
patients who harbored deleterious alterations in DDR genes, namely ATM, BRCA1, BRIP1, 
ERCC2, FANCD2, PALB2, and RAD50.
Improved outcomes in MIBC patients with DDR alterations to surgery and/or chemotherapy 
have been previously described. Yap et al. demonstrated significantly improved recurrence-
free survival following RC with or without chemotherapy in patients with non-synonymous 
alterations in a similar gene set (ATM, ERCC2, FANCD2, PALB2, BRCA1 and BRCA2) 24. 
Plimack et al. identified a significant association between alterations in any one of ATM, 
FANCC, or RB1 and complete response to neoadjuvant cisplatin-based chemotherapy 25. Of 
the DDR mutations identified in these studies, a minority was truncating (5/33 in Yap et al., 
11/30 in Plimack et al.), and the functionality of missense alterations was assessed by 
computational modeling or recurrent nature. As noted, our analysis was even more 
restrictive in defining deleterious alterations to minimize the influence of passenger 
alterations and did not employ recursive algorithms such as clustering typically used in 
RNA-based biomarker discovery. For this reason and the fundamental differences in 
treatment approach, while noting the interesting overlap of our findings with the noted prior 
work, we did not presume to attempt validation analyses of the prognostic gene sets reported 
by these two groups.
With that said, it is probable that the deleterious DDR alterations in this cohort do not 
impact upon therapeutic response equally. The main contributor of DDR deleterious 
alterations in our cohort was ERCC2. ERCC2 alterations correlated with a significantly 
lower cumulative incidence of metastatic recurrence and with a trend towards lower 
cumulative incidence of any recurrence. ERCC2 alterations occur at a higher rate in UCB 
than in other neoplasms and have been correlated significantly with pathologic complete 
response at RC following cisplatin-based neoadjuvant chemotherapy 10. The alterations in 
our study were clustered near conserved helicase domains, which are predicted to impact 
response primarily to adduct-forming agents such as cisplatin. However, only 3/6 patients 
with ERCC2 alterations received cisplatin as part of their treatment. Indeed, the single

 patient with ERCC2 alteration and local recurrence retained a pre-treatment ERCC2 G665C 
alteration in the recurrent tumor, following cisplatin-based neoadjuvant chemotherapy and 
gemcitabine CRT. This recurrence may be due to suboptimal effect from gemcitabine-based 
CRT or other factors. While our study is too small to assess the specific influence of ERCC2 
or its interaction with chemotherapy regimen, these observations nevertheless support 
further investigation into its potential role in regimen selection.
In contrast, we were unable to confirm an association between patient outcomes and MRE11 
expression by IHC, previously suggested as a predictive biomarker of RT response in 
UCB 11, 12. The reasons for our differing findings may be related to our smaller cohort size, 
a focus on recurrence events in our study vs. CSS in prior work, or variability in the 
performance characteristics of different antibody lots.
A primary study goal was to assess changes during tumor progression. A commonly held 
tenet of the “field effect” theory of UCB is that carcinogenic exposures imbue the 
urothelium with a predisposition to de novo tumor formation, challenging the concept of 
bladder-preservation. However, our study's finding that paired pre-treatment and recurrent 
bladder tumors share near identical genetic profiles implies that insufficient log-kill, 
possibly related to intrinsic low CRT sensitivity, drives local treatment failure. This 
highlights the importance of identifying baseline sensitivity factors to CRT and the relevance 
of pre-treatment actionable alterations.
Limitations of this study include its retrospective nature, small size, heterogeneous 
treatments and tissue and the lack of a validation set for the exploratory analysis of the 
prognostic impact of DDR alterations. From a technical standpoint, the rarity of available 
tissue necessitated inclusion of samples without paired normal, risking overcalling of 
alterations, or paired with normal-appearing areas of bladder tissue that may in fact harbor 
genetic alterations, risking the exclusion of true somatic alterations identified within tumor 
tissue during the mutation calling process. The current work is the first effort to our 
knowledge to profile the genetic landscape of tumors from UCB patients undergoing bladder 
preservation intent definitive chemoradiation. In the future, validation and homogenization 
of treatment/tissue input will require more extensive, multi-institution cohorts, which are 
likely only accessible from collaborative group trials, such as those of the RTOG. In the 
interim, we believe this work provides insights into the mechanism of treatment failure and 
the potential relationship between DDR alterations, specifically in ERCC2, to clinical 
outcomes in this population. Independent validation in larger CRT cohorts is needed.
Conclusion
In this next-generation sequencing analysis of a primarily CRT bladder preservation UCB 
cohort, we found that deleterious DDR alterations, most commonly found in ERCC2, may 
be associated with lower recurrence risk. Further, recurrent bladder tumors largely 
resembled pre-treatment tumors, arguing for pre-existing treatment resistance as the primary 
mechanism of failure. While these data require validation, they provide insight into potential 
predictors of therapeutic response and the biology of recurrence failures in UC managed 
with chemoradiation.

 Figure 1. 
Representation of the most commonly altered genes in this series of 48 patients with 
urothelial carcinoma of the bladder (UCB) treated with radiation-based bladder-preservation 
(left) and comparison to observed frequencies in TCGA of UCB and an 89 patient cohort of 
patients treated with radical cystectomy (right). Mutations are categorized as missense 
mutations (green), or truncating nonsense, frameshift, or splice site mutations and indels 
(black). Copy number amplifications (red bars) or deletions (blue bars) are noted.

frequencies in TCGA (right). Only altered cases are shown. Functional annotation of genes 
is displayed (colored squares) B, Oncoprint (left) showing only those alterations predicted to 
be deleterious and comparison to TCGA deleterious alteration frequencies (right). C, 
ERCC2 non-synonymous somatic missense mutations in the current study (bottom) are 
mapped on a stick plot and compared to 3 previously reported whole exome sequencing 
cohorts (top), including a cisplatin responder study (Van Allen et al.) and studies by Guo et 
al,(superficial and muscle-invasive UCB included) and TCGA for urothelial MIBC. Prior 
alterations in close proximity to currently observed alterations are detailed. CTD- Carboxy-

 Figure 3. 
Comparison of mutation profiles between paired tumor samples from individual patients. A, 
Recurrent bladder tumors share a majority of mutations with pre-radiation primary bladder 
tumors. B, Metastatic lesions also share alterations with bladder primaries, albeit with less 
overlap. Variant frequencies for mutations are normalized within each tumor to give relative 
values, as depicted on the color scales, which allow comparison across a patient's samples. 
Gene alterations are ordered for each patient based upon relative variant frequency in the 
reference bladder tumor in the first row of each diagram. For genes with multiple mutations, 
each shared alteration is represented separately; specific alterations corresponding to the 
genes listed are given in Supplementary Tables 5-6. Alterations were counted if present at 
≥2% frequency.
