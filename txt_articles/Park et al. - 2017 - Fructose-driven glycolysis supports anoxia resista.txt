The African naked mole-rat’s (Heterocephalus glaber) social and subterranean lifestyle
generates a hypoxic niche. Under experimental conditions, naked mole-rats tolerate hours
of extreme hypoxia and survive 18 minutes of total oxygen deprivation (anoxia) without
apparent injury. During anoxia, the naked mole-rat switches to anaerobic metabolism
fueled by fructose, which is actively accumulated and metabolized to lactate in the brain.
Global expression of the GLUT5 fructose transporter and high levels of ketohexokinase
were identified as molecular signatures of fructose metabolism. Fructose-driven glycolytic
respiration in naked mole-rat tissues avoids feedback inhibition of glycolysis via
phosphofructokinase, supporting viability. The metabolic rewiring of glycolysis can
circumvent the normally lethal effects of oxygen deprivation, a mechanism that could be
harnessed to minimize hypoxic damage in human disease.
I
n all kingdoms of life, extreme habitats drive
adaptive change to enable species to exploit
challenging environments. One challenge faced
by subterranean mammals that inhabit con-
fined spaces is an atmosphere low in O2 and
high in CO2. We studied the naked mole-rat’s
(Heterocephalus glaber) adaptation to low-O2 and
high-CO2 conditions (Fig. 1A), as this eusocial ro-
dent combines a subterranean lifestyle with large
colony sizes of up to 280 members (1–3). CO2
levels in naked mole-rat burrows can reach 7 to
10%, orders of magnitude higher than in surface
air (4). Correspondingly, naked mole-rats do not
begin to display behavioral avoidance, hyperven-
tilation, or tissue acidosis until CO2 levels reach
10% (fig. S1, A to E). Even a 5-hour exposure to
80% CO2 (20% O2) was not lethal for naked mole-
rats (fig. S1F). O2 levels are low in the burrows of
subterranean mammals (as low as 6%) (5, 6), and
the mass huddling behavior of naked mole-rats
may exacerbate their exposure to hypoxic stress.
To investigate the molecular mechanisms that
allow naked mole-rats to overcome hypoxic stress,
we subjected them to controlled hypoxia using
atmospheric chambers (Fig. 1, B and C), as ap-
proved by local ethics committees. Naked mole-
rats tolerated a chronic hypoxic environment of
5% O2 for 5 hours with no apparent ill effects,
whereas mice (Mus musculus) died in less than
15 min (Fig. 1B). We next exposed animals to 0% O2
in a chamber flushed with N2 (10 liters/min).
Respiration in mice ceased, on average, 45 ± 5 s
after entering the chamber, and none recovered
when reexposed to normoxia 20 s later (n = 4 mice)
(Fig. 1C). Similarly, naked mole-rats rapidly lost
consciousness (in ~30 s) after exposure to 0% O2,
but unlike mice, the naked mole-rats continued
to make sporadic breathing attempts for several
minutes (mean 250 ± 2.2 s; n = 4 naked mole-rats)
(Fig. 1C). After respiration ceased, naked mole-rats
were left in 0% O2 for an additional minute. Sur-
prisingly, all four naked mole-rats started breath-
ing within seconds upon exposure to room air (Fig.
1C), and all rejoined their colony with no sign of
neurological or behavioral deficits. In further ex-
periments, naked mole-rats recovered from fixed
10-min (fig. S2, A and B) and 18-min (Fig. 1,
D and E) 0% O2 exposures, but never from a
30-min exposure (Fig. 1F). Respiratory attempts
stopped after ~7 min but resumed after 10 min
(Fig. 1D). The heart rate dropped within 2 min
from a baseline of ~200 beats per minute (bpm)
(7) to a steady 50 bpm throughout anoxia (Fig.
1E). In mice, the heart rate rapidly and contin-
uously declined until ~6 min, when it was unde-
tectable by electrocardiogram (Fig. 1E). In anoxic
conditions, circulating hemoglobin, which shows
a high affinity for O2 (8), could provide a minimal
O2 supply to naked mole-rat organs. During an-
oxia, naked mole-rat body temperature was main-
tained at 30°C (fig. S3B), the preferred body
temperature of these poikilothermic animals (9, 10).
However, warming naked mole-rats to 37°C de-
creased maximum survival times to 6 min, still
much longer than mouse survival times (fig. S3C).
Experiments with isolated hearts (Langen-
dorff preparation) exposed to hypoxia (by stopping
perfusion with oxygenated buffer for 30 min)
showed that left ventricular developed pressure
(LVDP) recovered almost completely to pre-ischemic
values in naked mole-rats but not in mice (Fig.
1G and table S1). The mouse LVDP never recov-
ered to more than 65% of baseline, even when
examined at 30°C. Thus, the ability of the naked
mole-rat heart to continue beating under anoxia
is supported by an intrinsic cardiac hypoxia re-
sistance. Both hypercapnia and hypoxia lead to
pulmonary edema in mice but not in naked mole-
rats (fig. S4, A and B).
We postulated that naked mole-rat vital organs
survive O2 deprivation with metabolic suppres-
sion similar to hibernation, torpor, or suspended
animation–like states (11–13). Using metabolomics
based on gas chromatography–mass spectrometry
(GC-MS) (14, 15), we measured quantitative changes
in metabolite concentration during anoxia (cal-
ibrations in fig. S5) and compared normoxic base-
line values to those at 40 s and 10 min (mouse)
or 10 and 30 min (naked mole-rat) of anoxia
(Fig. 2A). In contrast to mice, only minor changes
in the succinate/fumarate ratio (16) were ob-
served in naked mole-rat tissues during anoxia,
a sign of mitochondrial shutdown (fig. S6). GC-MS
metabolomics can resolve hexoses, which allowed
us to observe a specific and marked increase in
fructose and sucrose concentration in the liver,
kidney, and blood of naked mole-rats 10 min
into anoxia (Fig. 2, B to D, and fig. S7, A and B).
No statistically significant changes in the levels of
these sugars were seen in mouse tissues during
anoxia (Fig. 2D and fig. S7). The unexpected ap-
pearance of high concentrations of fructose (up
to 240 mM in blood) and sucrose, a fructose-
glucose disaccharide (up to 1.47 mM in blood at
30 min) (fig. S7), in anoxic tissues suggested that
these sugars might fuel metabolism under hypoxic
conditions. Fructose enters glycolytic metabolism
after phosphorylation by ketohexokinase (KHK)
and is converted to fructose-1-phosphate (F1P).
Fructolysis is prominent in the kidney, which
expresses high levels of both the more fructose-
selective KHK-C isoform and the less-efficient
KHK-A isoform (17–20). Consistently, we detected

 high levels of F1P in the kidney, which were un-
altered after anoxia in both species (Fig. 2D).
However, F1P was undetectable in normoxic brains
but appeared in significant amounts only in
anoxic naked mole-rat brains, indicating a switch
to fructose metabolism (Fig. 2D). Surprisingly,
naked mole-rats were hypoglycemic compared
with mice (mean blood glucose 3.49 ± 0.1 versus
6.66 ± 0.3 mM in mice) (fig. S8A) (21), but during
anoxia, naked mole-rat glucose levels did not
show consistent changes divergent from those in
the mouse (fig. S8). Furthermore, although there
were some differences in glycogen stores be-
tween the two species, these were relatively small
and not consistent across all tissues (fig. S8).
Fructose can enter cells via GLUT2 and GLUT5,
which belong to the SLC2A transporter family
(17, 22). The GLUT5 (SLC2A5) protein is a highly
selective fructose transporter (18) predominantly
expressed in the mouse intestine and kidney but
hardly present in the brain and heart (17). Using
quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction
(qPCR), we found that naked mole-rat GLUT5
mRNA (Slc2a5) (fig. S9A) was expressed at high
levels (>10-fold higher than mouse) in all exam-
ined tissues, including the brain, heart, liver, and
lung (Fig. 2E). As analyzed with Western blot-
ting, GLUT5 protein levels were higher in naked
mole-rat heart and brain tissue compared with
mouse, and levels broadly reflected mRNA levels
(Fig. 2F and fig. S9C). Thus, naked mole-rat brain
and cardiac tissue likely take up fructose for
glycolytic metabolism. Consistently, both KHK
isoforms were markedly up-regulated in naked
mole-rat heart, brain, and liver tissue compared
with the same tissues in mice (Fig. 2G and fig. S9B).
Brain tissue from naked mole-rats shows a
pronounced, intrinsic tolerance to anoxia (19).
We thus tested whether naked mole-rat brains
can function by using fructose-fueled glycolytic
metabolism. We measured field excitatory post-
synaptic potentials (fEPSPs) in hippocampal slices
from mouse and naked mole-rat hippocampi
(n = 3 animals per species) before and 60 min
after replacement of 10 mM glucose in the buffer
with 10 mM fructose (normoxic conditions). With
fructose as the sole available sugar, fEPSP ampli-
tude declined steadily but at different rates in
mouse and naked mole-rat slices (Fig. 3A). In
mice, fEPSPs were almost undetectable 60 min
after the glucose-to-fructose switch, but fEPSP
amplitudes in naked mole-rat slices had stabi-
lized to ~33% of control values. After slices were
reperfused with glucose-containing buffer, mean
fEPSP amplitudes returned to control levels in
naked mole-rat slices but only partially recovered
in mouse slices [two-way analysis of variance
(ANOVA), P < 0.05] (Fig. 3A). We also examined
whether fructose could be used to fuel the iso-
lated beating heart. Naked mole-rat or mouse
hearts were perfused with Krebs-Henseleit buffer
containing glucose that was then switched to
fructose for two periods of 60 min each. The
LVDP of the naked mole-rat hearts remained
stable during both fructose switches. However,
in the mouse heart, LVDP was reduced during
both fructose exposures and differed signifi-
cantly from that of naked mole-rat hearts during
the latter exposure (Fig. 3B). Thus, fructose can
replace glucose as an energy source in the naked
mole-rat brain and heart.
Glucose is metabolized via phosphofructo-
kinase (PFK), a rate-limiting step subject to feed-
back inhibition via allosteric binding of adenosine
triphosphate, low pH, and downstream interme-
diates (8, 20, 23) (Fig. 4A). Fructose phospho-
rylation via KHK could bypass the PFK regulatory
block, allowing continued glycolytic flux indepen-
dent of cellular energy status. We used metabolic
flux analysis to measure the incorporation of
fructose-derived carbons into glycolytic interme-
diates in hypoxic brain slices. Acutely isolated
brain slices were incubated in media in which
glucose was rapidly replaced with the stable
isotope 13C6-D-fructose (10 mM) and were kept
at 32°C with 5% O2 levels (24). Metabolites were
measured at 0, 5, 15, and 30 min after the switch
to 13C6-D-fructose. Similar metabolite pools were
detected in both species, suggesting that metab-
olism was at the same steady state in both species
(fig. S10). We could measure significant incorpo-
ration of fructose-derived carbons in glycolytic
intermediates in both species (Fig. 4, A to H), but

 the incorporation of fructose-derived carbons was
both faster and larger in the naked mole-rat com-
pared with the mouse (between two- and fivefold).
This observation was found to be true for interme-
diates such as dihydroxyacetone phosphate (DHAP)
and glycerol-3-phosphate (Glyc-3-P) (Fig. 4, B and H)
but also for glycolytic end products like pyruvate
and lactate (Fig. 4, D and G). Increased fructose-
derived carbon incorporation into citrate was also
observed in the naked mole-rat (Fig. 4E).
The naked mole-rat has evolved the ability to
use fructose to fuel vital organs such as the heart
and brain under near-anaerobic conditions. This
metabolic rewiring involves equipping metabol-
ically active organs with transporters and enzymes
that metabolize fructose to lactate using a path-
way that bypasses metabolic block at PFK (Fig.
4A). Fructose and sucrose (the latter is degraded
to hexose monomers) are both increased to sta-
tistically significant levels in the naked mole-rat
during anoxia. The source of these sugars is un-
known. Fructolysis in mammals is normally large-
ly restricted to the liver and kidney (25). A switch
to fructose metabolism under hypoxic stress has
been associated with cancer malignancy, meta-
bolic syndrome, and heart failure (26–29). It is
thus important to understand how naked mole-
rats utilize fructose metabolism with no apparent
physiological drawbacks. Molecular insights into
the rewired metabolism of the naked mole-rat
may help in devising strategies to prevent hypoxic
damage associated with ischemic heart disease
and stroke.

Fig. 4. Metabolic flux of fructose metabolites in the hypoxic brain. (A) Glycolysis pathway. Glucose
enters the brain via GLUT1 and is converted via phosphofructokinase (PFK). Fructose enters cells via
GLUT5 and is phosphorylated by ketohexokinase (KHK) to fructose-1-phosphate (F1P) at a much higher
efficiency than by hexokinase (HK). F1P is directly metabolized into trioses via aldolase B (ALDOB) or
aldolase C (ALDOC), bypassing feedback inhibition. GA3P
, glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate; TCA, tricarboxylic
acid. (B to H) Incorporation of 13C-fructose–derived carbons was measured during acute hypoxia (~5% O2) at
0, 5, 15, and 30 min. Labeled quantities of the different metabolic intermediates (in blue) are shown. (B)
Dihydroxyacetone phosphate (DHAP). (C) Phosphoglyceric acid (3PGA). (D) Pyruvate. (E) Citrate. (F)
Succinate. (G) Lactate. (H) Glycerol-3-phosphate (Glyc-3-P). n = 3 animals per species; error bars indicate
SEM; *P < 0.05; **P < 0.01, ***P < 0.001 using a two-way ANOVA with a Bonferroni’s post hoc test.
