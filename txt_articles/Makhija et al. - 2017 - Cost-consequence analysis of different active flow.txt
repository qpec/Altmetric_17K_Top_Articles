ABSTRACT
Background: A recent retrospective comparative effectiveness study found that use of the FLOSEAL
Hemostatic Matrix in cardiac surgery was associated with significantly lower risks of complications,
blood transfusions, surgical revisions, and shorter length of surgery than use of SURGIFLO Hemostatic
Matrix. These outcome improvements in cardiac surgery procedures may translate to economic savings
for hospitals and payers.
Objective: The objective of this study was to estimate the cost-consequence of two flowable hemo-
static matrices (FLOSEAL or SURGIFLO) in cardiac surgeries for US hospitals.
Methods: A cost-consequence model was constructed using clinical outcomes from a previously pub-
lished retrospective comparative effectiveness study of FLOSEAL vs SURGIFLO in adult cardiac surgeries.
The model accounted for the reported differences between these products in length of surgery, rates
of major and minor complications, surgical revisions, and blood product transfusions. Costs were
derived from Healthcare Cost and Utilization Project’s National Inpatient Sample (NIS) 2012 database
and converted to 2015 US dollars. Savings were modeled for a hospital performing 245 cardiac sur-
geries annually, as identified as the average for hospitals in the NIS dataset. One-way sensitivity ana-
lysis and probabilistic sensitivity analysis were performed to test model robustness.
Results: The results suggest that if FLOSEAL is utilized in a hospital that performs 245 mixed cardiac
surgery procedures annually, 11 major complications, 31 minor complications, nine surgical revisions,
79 blood product transfusions, and 260.3 h of cumulative operating time could be avoided. These
improved outcomes correspond to a net annualized saving of $1,532,896. Cost savings remained con-
sistent between $1.3m and $1.8m and between $911k and $2.4m, even after accounting for the uncer-
tainty around clinical and cost inputs, in a one-way and probabilistic sensitivity analysis, respectively.
Conclusions: Outcome differences associated with FLOSEAL vs SURGIFLO that were previously
reported in a comparative effectiveness study may result in substantial cost savings for US hospitals.

Introduction
Achieving hemostasis is critical with any surgical procedure.
Inadequate hemostasis during surgery may lead to a number
of major and minor complications that can result in increased
morbidity and mortality1–3. Approximately 4% of patients
may require surgical revision due to excessive blood loss dur-
ing and after cardiac surgery4–6. Patients requiring surgical
revision following cardiac surgery have been associated with
a greater risk of renal failure, prolonged mechanical ventila-
tion,
acute
respiratory
distress
syndrome,
sepsis,
atrial
arrhythmias, and operative mortality in a study of over 6,000
patients4 and increased hospital length of stay (LOS) and
mortality in a study of 8,586 patients undergoing a coronary
artery pass graft (CABG)5. Patients requiring resternotomy
because of excessive bleeding following cardiac surgery were
associated with a prolonged Intensive Care Unit (ICU) stay,
the
need
for
intra-aortic
balloon
counterpulsation,
and
death6.
In a study of over 1 million surgeries (including cardiac,
vascular, non-cardiac thoracic, solid organ, general, knee/hip
replacement,
reproductive
organ,
and
spinal
surgery),
patients
who
experience
bleeding-related
complications
and/or blood product transfusions during surgical hospitaliza-
tion have been found to have longer overall hospital LOS
(10.4 vs. 4.4 days) and ICU LOS (3.3 vs. 0.5 days), which
increases the economic burden relative to patients with
adequate hemostasis7. In all surgical sub-populations, the
bleeding-related complication and/or blood product transfu-
sion groups had higher total hospital costs7. The ratio of
average total costs estimated for patients with bleeding com-
plications vs those without complications ranged from 1.31
for cardiac surgery to 1.93 for vascular surgery7.
Conventional
methods
of
controlling
intra-operative
bleeding, such as suture, cautery, or ligature, may be ineffect-
ive or impractical in certain surgery settings8. Consequently,

 developed to decrease perioperative bleeding. Hemostatic
agents such as glues, adhesives, and sealants help to stop
bleeding when applied directly to the site of a bleed.
However, some bleeding sites are difficult to reach, and their
effectiveness
can
be
limited
in
patients
who
receive
heparin8,9.
In the US, two gelatin-based hemostatic matrices often
used are FLOSEAL Hemostatic Matrix (Baxter Healthcare
Corporation, Deerfield, IL)10 and SURGIFLO Hemostatic Matrix
(Ethicon
Incorporated,
Somerville,
NJ)11.
These
flowable
agents both contain gelatin and thrombin in a single applica-
tion product. However, the old preparation of SURGIFLO did
not include thrombin; therefore, studies from the past com-
pared outcomes of the use of the two products with the
adjunct of thrombin to the original SURGIFLO preparation
(FLOSEAL vs SURGIFLO þ Thrombin). The role of gelatin is to
induce hemostasis via platelet activation, as well as mechan-
ical compression. The role of thrombin is to cleave the
fibrinogen to form fibrin. Thus, these agents have a dual
mechanism of action due to their ability to act at the begin-
ning and end of the coagulation cascade to promote physical
contact activation of platelets and facilitate fibrin formation,
respectively. Additionally, these agents also hold the throm-
bin on the bleeding site, preventing the dispersion of throm-
bin in its natural liquid form. Randomized clinical trials have
demonstrated that these flowable hemostatic agents have
increased efficacy relative to conventional methods in a var-
iety of surgical specialties due to their ability to effectively
conform to wound crevices, fill in deep lesions, and ease
irrigation12,13.
However, despite their similar mechanisms of action,
FLOSEAL and SURGIFLO have demonstrated hemostatic per-
formance differences due to the composition of their gelatin
granules14,15. These hemostats differ in the following gelatin
granule characteristics: species type (bovine vs porcine),
shape, size, smoothness, and surface area14. FLOSEAL is com-
prised of a self-expandable gelatin matrix component and
lyophilized bovine thrombin10. In contrast, SURGIFLO is com-
prised of a partially reconstituted porcine gelatin and is pre-
pared
with
EVITHROM
(Topical
Human
Thrombin)11.
Furthermore, the gelatin within FLOSEAL is arranged with
smooth distinct round particles, while the gelatin within
SURGIFLO is arranged with stellate coalescing ribbon-like
particles14.
Both in vitro and in vivo animal studies have proven that
FLOSEAL is superior to SURGIFLO in achieving effective
hemostasis due to its smooth gelatin matrix14,15. In vitro
results indicate that smooth gelatin retains significantly more
thrombin relative to stellate gelatin before being mixed with
blood (6.81 vs 10.89 IU/mL, p ¼ .0013) and after a clot forma-
tion (0.613 vs 1.289 IU/ml, p ¼ .0003)14. In vivo animal studies
found similar results indicating that smooth gelatin is able to
provide superior hemostatic efficiency as compared to stel-
late gelatin at 5 min and 10 min after application14.
There are no randomized controlled trials comparing
FLOSEAL and SURGIFLO in cardiac surgery or other types of
surgery. However, three retrospective comparative effective-
ness analyses have been conducted in spine and cardiac sur-
geries using the Premier hospital database2,3,16. The Premier
database captures approximately one of every four hospital
discharges in the US with date-stamped log including proce-
dures,
medications,
laboratory,
and
diagnostic
services
encountered by a patient during a given hospital stay17.
The Price et al.3 observational database analysis using the
Premier’s
Hospital
Database
concluded
that,
for
major
spine surgery cases, SURGIFLO was associated with increased
risk of blood product transfusion (Odds Ratio, OR ¼ 2.56,
p < .001), longer surgery time (þ8.84 min, p < .0001), and
increased product usage (þ3.34 mL, p < .001), compared to
FLOSEAL. Similarly, for severe spine surgery cases, use of
SURGIFLO
was
associated
with
longer
surgical
time
(þ26.9 min, p < .001) and increased product usage (þ1.52 mL,
p < .01) compared to FLOSEAL3.
David et al.16 also evaluated SURGIFLO vs FLOSEAL in spi-
nal surgeries using the Premier Hospital Database. The
authors concluded that the choice of hemostatic agent had
no effect on clinical outcomes and that SURGIFLO could lead
to hospital cost savings of $65 per surgery and an additional
$21 savings per additional hour of surgery. However, contrary
to Price et al.3, David et al.16 did not include procedures such
as corpectomies and tumor removal that have a high risk of
bleeding challenges and allowed for multiple hemostatic
agents to be used, hence confounding the results.
The Tackett et al.2 analysis of cardiac surgical cases cap-
tured in the Premier Hospital Database from 2006–2012
assessed real-world outcomes of FLOSEAL and SURGIFLO in
cardiac patients. Cohort A included 4,480 FLOSEAL and 326
SURGIFLO cases, and results indicated that SURGIFLO cases
were associated with significantly higher risk of multiple
adverse outcomes, including major (OR ¼ 2.12, p ¼ .001) and
minor complications (OR ¼ 1.84, p < .001); surgical revisions
(OR ¼ 2.01, p ¼ .042); transfusions for any blood products
(OR ¼ 4.90, p < .001), and longer surgery times (adjusted
mean difference ¼ 64 min, p < .001) than the FLOSEAL group.
There were no significant differences in mortality and hos-
pital LOS between the comparator groups2.
The objective of this analysis was to understand the cost-
consequence (i.e. direct cost savings) and the economic
implications associated with the usage of two absorbable
flowable hemostatic agents (FLOSEAL vs SURGIFLO) when
used for controlling intra-operative bleeding during cardiac
surgery procedures.
Methods
Overview
A cost-consequence model was developed in Microsoft Excel
(Redmond, WA) to estimate the annualized clinical and eco-
nomic impact of FLOSEAL vs SURGIFLO. The model was
based on the average number of cardiac surgeries performed
in US hospitals, accounting for the difference in clinical out-
comes between the two products, and the corresponding
costs.
The
cardiac
procedures
included
coronary
artery
bypass grafting (CABG), valve surgery, and thoracic aortic sur-
gery in an adult population. The model uses the clinical data
as published by Tackett et al.2 and supplemented by add-
itional outputs (e.g. adjusted rates of complications, revisions,
566
D. MAKHIJA ET AL.
 and transfusion) derived from the same analysis using the
Premier’s US Perspective Hospital Database17. An analysis of
2012
Healthcare
Cost
and
Utilization
Project’s
(HCUP’s)
National Inpatient Sample (NIS)18 data was also performed to
provide inputs for the costs of complications. All inputs and
their sources are described below.
Clinical inputs
All clinical inputs from Cohort A (i.e. FLOSEAL only vs
SURGIFLO only) in Tackett et al.2 shown to be statistically dif-
ferent were included in the model (Table 1). These include:
(1) average surgery time per procedure; (2) rate of overall
major post-operative complications; (3) rate of overall minor
post-operative complications; (4) rate of cases requiring surgi-
cal revision; and (5) rate of cases requiring blood product
transfusions (any blood product transfusion, i.e. packed red
blood cell and plasma product). It is noted that surgical revi-
sions were identified if the patient was returned to the oper-
ating room to address surgical bleeding by identification of
the ICD-9 code for a rethoracotomy to an existing surgical
site
within
the
same
hospitalization.
Reoperations
were
excluded because of the unpredictable impact on intra-
operative bleeding which would have had significant effects
on the data analysis.
It is also noted that, while the rates of major and minor
complications overall were significantly different between
FLOSEAL and SURGIFLO, the distribution of individual major
(stroke, shock, sepsis, myocardial infarction, or any combin-
ation of two or more major complications) and minor (renal
failure, respiratory insufficiency, inotropic support lasting
more than 24 h, or any combination of two or more minor
complications) complications was assumed to be the same
whether one uses FLOSEAL or SURGIFLO (Table 1).
Additional analyses were conducted on the same dataset
to identify adjusted values for certain parameters that had
not been published. This was the case for the adjusted rates
of revisions, transfusion, major complications, and minor
complications. Additionally, the estimated average volume
used per case were 9.0 mL and 9.7 mL for FLOSEAL and
SURGIFLO, respectively.
All clinical inputs used in the model are summarized in
Table 1.
Cost inputs
US cost inputs were broken down into product costs and sur-
gery-related costs (Table 2).
Product costs
The cost of product was obtained by multiplying the average
product volume (i.e. FLOSEAL: 9.0 mL; SURGIFLO: 9.7 mL) with
publicly
available
product
prices
(Baxter
Wholesale
Acquisition Cost (WAC) for FLOSEAL and Average Sales Price
(ASP) for SURGIFLO from the IMS Health Hospital Supply
Index). This provides estimated total product cost figures at
the population level, which is relevant from the hospital
perspective.
Operating room costs
Using estimates from Chatterjee et al.19 and updating to
2015 US dollars using the Medical Care Consumer Price Index
(CPI), the operating room costs used in the model were esti-
mated to be $462 for each 15-min interval. This estimate was
calculated from an average per minute cost for operating
room
time
across
five
different
high-volume
surgical
procedures19.
Surgery and complication costs
The 2012 NIS18 dataset was used to estimate surgery and
complication costs. The NIS is a database of inpatient stays
from billing data submitted by hospitals to statewide data
organizations across the US. The NIS is used to make national
estimates of healthcare utilization, access, charges, quality,
and outcomes. The NIS covers all patients, including individu-
als covered by Medicare, Medicaid, or private insurance, as
well as those who are uninsured. The NIS dataset contains

 data from �8 million hospital stays from over 1,000 hospitals
sampled to approximate a 20% stratified sample of US com-
munity hospitals. For each hospital stay, the NIS database
records ICD-9 diagnosis and procedure codes. Weights are
provided to calculate national estimates. We used full year
2012 NIS data as it was the latest year of data available.
Appropriate ICD-9 procedure codes (Table 2) were used
to identify cardiac surgeries (CABG, valve surgery, thoracic
aortic surgery), as well as the associated major and minor
complications included in the model. HCUP hospital-level
Cost-to-Charge Ratios were applied to calculate the mean
total hospital cost. These costs were then converted to
2015 US dollars using the Medical Care CPI.
Surgery-related costs (Table 2) included (1) Average base
cost of a cardiac surgery procedure without complications,
revision, or blood product transfusion18, (2) Average cost of
cardiac surgery procedure with blood product transfusion,
but without complications or revision, (3) Average cost of
cardiac surgery procedure with revision, but without compli-
cations or blood product transfusion, (4) Average costs of the
surgical procedure with one major (stroke, shock, sepsis, or
myocardial infarction) or minor (renal failure, respiratory
insufficiency, or inotropic support lasting more than 24 h)
complication, but without revision or blood product transfu-
sion18, and (5) Average costs of the surgical procedure with a
combination of two or more major or minor events, but
without revision or blood product transfusion.
Incremental costs for each complication were calculated
as the difference between the total cost for surgery with the
complication and the base cost of the surgical procedure
without complication ($38,486).
Model analyses
To make our cost modeling relevant to the reader, cost sav-
ings were estimated for a hospital performing the average
number of mixed cardiac surgeries per year in the US. The
NIS 2012 data was again used to identify the number of
mixed cardiac procedures for the average hospital in the US.
ICD-9 procedure codes identified each CABG, Valve Surgery,
and Thoracic Aortic surgery at the hospital level. On average,
245 mixed cardiac surgeries were performed in 2012 per hos-
pital from the 1,178 hospitals included in the NIS dataset18.
Therefore, the model assumes a population size of 245 mixed
cardiac surgery patients.
The outputs of the cost-consequence model were calcu-
lated in terms of the annualized comparative clinical out-
comes avoided (major complication, minor complications,
surgical revisions, transfusions) and the corresponding cost
savings of using FLOSEAL relative to SURGIFLO. By doing so,
the net cost impact of using FLOSEAL vs SURGIFLO was
estimated.
Sensitivity analyses
One-way and probabilistic sensitivity analyses were per-
formed to identify the major cost drivers accounting for
uncertainty around the estimates.

 One-way sensitivity analyses were conducted by varying
all clinical and economic inputs one at a time using the
lower and upper boundaries of the 95% confidence intervals
or by ±20% when the 95% confidence interval was not
available.
Probabilistic sensitivity analysis (PSA) was conducted using
the Monte Carlo simulation method. All key clinical and eco-
nomic inputs were varied at the same time by randomly
selecting a value for each parameter within the 95% confi-
dence interval of that parameter according to a distribution
probability. All parameters, their 95% confidence interval and
the distribution probabilities can be found in Appendix
Tables A1 and A2.
Distributions of economic and clinical outcomes based on

Results
Base model
The model estimates that, for an average hospital that per-
forms 245 cardiac surgeries per year, using FLOSEAL rather
than SURGIFLO could avoid 42 complications (11 major, 31
minor), nine surgical revisions, and 79 blood product transfu-
sions. In addition, operating room time for these cardiac sur-
geries could be reduced by 260 h. Figure 1 shows that, even
if its acquisition cost is higher ($48,519 for 245 cardiac sur-
geries), FLOSEAL is expected to generate substantial annual
net cost savings ($1,532,896 for 245 cardiac surgeries) com-
pared to SURGIFLO.
Sensitivity analyses
Varying each model parameter one at a time in the one-way
sensitivity analyses showed that FLOSEAL’s savings for the
same 245 patient cohort ranged from $1,317,675–$1,819,536.
The most important cost drivers were: (1) the ratio of cardiac
surgery cases requiring surgery revision for bleeding, (2) the
ratio of minor complications, (3) the ratio of major complica-
tions, (4) the cost of the base cardiac surgery, (5) the per-
centage of major complications, (6) the percentage of cardiac
surgery cases requiring surgical revision for bleeding, (7) the
percentage of minor complications, (8) the surgery time ratio,
(9) the cost of cardiac surgery with blood product transfu-
sion, and (10) the cost of operating room time (Figure 2).
Variation in the cost of hemostatic agents had only a minor
impact on the results. In all analyses, the difference was
always in favor of FLOSEAL, consistently demonstrated in
savings.
When varying all parameters at the same time in the PSA,
the
minimum
and
maximum
savings
associated
with
FLOSEAL
ranged
from
$911,010–$2,435,589
(Figure
3).
FLOSEAL
was
cost
saving
in
all
1000
iterations.
Approximately 56% of simulations were above the base case
and, thus, the model’s net economic savings of $1.5 million
can be considered a relatively robust estimate in approximat-
ing the benefit of using FLOSEAL relative to SURGIFLO.
Discussion
We estimate that the average US hospital that utilizes
FLOSEAL as an adjunct to hemostasis in cardiac surgery pro-
cedures may see a reduction of 11 major complications, 31
minor complications, nine surgical revisions, 79 blood prod-
uct transfusions, and 260.3 h of operating room time com-
pared to SURGIFLO. This can result in significant net savings
with FLOSEAL when compared to SURGIFLO in cardiac sur-
gery procedures (base case analysis) ($1.5 million per 245 car-
diac surgery procedures per year). The net cost impact of
using FLOSEAL vs SURGIFLO remained cost-saving after sensi-
tivity analyses and scenario analyses. After adjusting all clin-
ical
and
cost
inputs,
FLOSEAL’s
savings
still
remained
between $1.3–$1.8 million for a US hospital performing 245
cardiac surgery procedures per year. Furthermore, in the PSA,
after 1000 iterations, FLOSEAL’s cost savings ranged between
$911k and $2.4 million. Thus, both types of sensitivity analy-
ses indicated the robustness of the cost savings associated
with use of FLOSEAL vs SURGIFLO.
Our results support prior research which estimated a sig-
nificant cost saving when using FLOSEAL vs non-flowable
topical
hemostats

work,
there
are
two
important
differences
besides
the
comparator: (1) while the prior economic analysis20 utilized
results from a randomized controlled trial of 415 patients,
our clinical inputs were derived from a recent real-world
effectiveness analysis of 4806 patients; (2) while the prior
economic analysis20 used the 2010 US Hospital discharge
data from six different states to obtain cost inputs, we used
the
2012
NIS
database
to
identify
cost
estimates
and
adjusted these figures to 2015 dollars. The strength of the
NIS data is that it is representative of 95% of the US popula-
tion and, thus, more generalizable. Therefore, using real-
world data and cost estimates from a more representative
dataset may help increase the generalizability of our findings.
Limitations
All economic models are a simplification of a complex health-
care situation and, hence, bear the limitations associated
with a simple representation of reality. For example, our
model assumed the same distributions for major and minor
complications for FLOSEAL and SURGIFLO. This may not be
the case in reality, but we had no solid evidence supporting
a different assumption.
There is likely departmental-level variation in cost to
charge ratios; however, HCUP only provides charge data per
discharge. Therefore, we are unable to use departmental
level CCRs with this data source.

amount, and quality of the data available. We used the
COST IMPACT OF HEMOSTATIC MATRIX USAGE IN CARDIAC SURGERY

 comparative effectiveness study published by Tackett et al.2
as the basis for the clinical end-points in our model.
Although this study is an observational study and had signifi-
cantly more use of FLOSEAL (n ¼ 4,480) compared with
SURGIFLO (n ¼ 326),
it
is
the
only
evidence
comparing
FLOSEAL to SURGIGLO in cardiac surgery procedures. Also,
while the sample sizes of FLOSEAL and SURGIFLO use were
different by over an order of magnitude, results were highly
statistically significant at the p < .001 level, and this distribu-
tion reflects the market penetration of the two products in
the US market during the study period. Similarly, we have
used the best evidence available at this time (i.e. HCUP) for
costing healthcare resources/consequences.
This
study
was
also
performed
using
data
from
2006–2012. Since then, the introduction of new treatment
guidelines for management of intra- and post-operative

 coagulopathy has positively impacted the rate of complica-
tions and transfusions compared to the study period. Within
this context, the use of viscoelastic hemostasis assays, such
as ROTEM or TEG, as tools to optimize the management of
coagulopathy and reduce bleeding complications, was not
evaluated in the study analysis since use of the technology
was not widespread, nor standardized during the study
period.
Our model was built for the US healthcare environment
(i.e. using clinical evidence and costs from the US healthcare
system), and, although it is very relevant for US hospitals, the
generalizability of our results should be adjusted to other
jurisdictions.
Conclusion
Despite the limitations described above, this cost conse-
quence analysis suggests that cost savings at the hospital
level may be generated by using FLOSEAL rather than
SURGIFLO in cardiac procedures. While various sensitivity
analyses demonstrated the robustness of the estimated cost
savings in cardiac procedures, an additional study with the
primary objective of investigating both the comparative out-
comes and cost associated with different hemostatic matrices
could be pursued to confirm this finding in Cardiac proce-
dures, as well as other surgery types.
