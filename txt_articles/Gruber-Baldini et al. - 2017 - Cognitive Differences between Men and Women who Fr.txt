Abstract
Background/Objectives—There is limited research in cognition and its relationship to 
mortality after hip fracture among men compared to women. Therefore, the goals of this study 
were to: (1) compare men and women who fractured their hip on cognition after hospital 
discharge, and (2) examine the impact of cognition on the differential risk of 6-month mortality 
between men and women post fracture.
Design—Prospective cohort study
Setting—Eight hospitals in Baltimore, Maryland.
Participants—Frequency matched 168 male and 171 female hip fracture patients, ages 65 or 
older, living in the community before fracture
Measurements—Cognition assed by Modified Mini-Mental State Examination (3MS, and 
derived MMSE score), Hooper Visual Organization test (HVOT), and Trail-making test (Trails A 
& B) within 22 days of hospital admission, and 6-month mortality.

 Results—Men had more impaired cognitive scores on 3MS, MMSE, HVOT, and Trails A (p<.
05) at baseline. These statistically significant differences between men and women remained on 
MMSE and HVOT after controlling for pre-fracture dementia, in-hospital delirium, age, education, 
race, and comorbidity. Men had higher 6-month mortality rates (HR=4.4, p<.001). Cognitive 
measures were also significantly associated with mortality, including 3MS, HVOT, and Trails B. 
Among the cognitive measures, higher 3MS was most protective for mortality (HR=0.98, p<.001), 
both unadjusted and adjusted for other cognitive scales, comorbidity, delirium, and pre-existing 
dementia. The highest mortality was among men with 3MS<78, with 26.3% dying within 6 
months. The effects of cognition on mortality did not differ by sex.
Conclusion—Men display greater levels of cognitive impairment within the first 22 days of hip 
fracture than women, and cognitive limitations increase the risk of mortality in both men and 
women.

Background
Hip fracture is a condition that greatly increases disability and mortality risk.1 While 
typically occuring in older women, the number of men who will experience a hip fracture 
will increase in the coming decades.2 An estimated 25–30% of the approximately 290,000 
hip fractures in the U.S. currently occur in men.3 It is estimated that by 2025, the number of 
hip fractures in men will be the same as that currently seen in women, making this an 
emerging public health concern for older men, their families, and the healthcare system.4 
Compared to women, men who fracture a hip have an increased risk of mortality,5 and more 
comorbid diseases, 6,8–10 despite their younger age at the time of fracture.6,7
Dementia is also a known risk factor for hip fracture.11 It is estimated that 35–61% of hip 
fracture patients exhibit some sort of cognitive impairment during hospitalization,12 with 
estimates of pre-existing dementia around 20%.12 Previous studies have shown that 
dementia, delirium, and general cognitive impairment are predictive of poorer functional 
recovery13 and higher mortality.12,14 There is limited research in cognition after hip fracture 
among men and the impact of cognition on the observed sex differences in mortality.15
Therefore, the goals of this study were to: (1) Compare cognitive functioning between men 
and women who fractured their hip, including measures of global cognition; visual search, 
sequencing, and motor tracking speed; executive control; and visual spatial analysis; and (2) 
Examine the impact of cognition on the differential risk of mortality between men and 
women over 6 months post fracture.
Methods
Subjects
The prospective cohort was made up of community-dwelling patients aged 65 years or older 
admitted during the study period to any of the 8 study hospitals in the Baltimore Hip Studies

 network for surgical repair of hip fracture who provided consent (or whose proxy provided 
consent) to participate within 15 days of admission. Recruitment for men was ongoing while 
recruitment of women was frequency-matched with men within each hospital. This strategy 
ensured equal numbers of women and men enrolled throughout the study to avoid 
confounding by secular and institutional differences in patterns of care. The protocol was 
approved by the Institutional Review Board (IRB) at the University of Maryland Baltimore, 
as well as each study hospital’s IRB.
Individuals were excluded if: had a pathologic fracture; not ambulating 6 months prior to the 
fracture; not English speaking; lived more than 70 miles from the hospital; weighed over 
300 pounds; or hardware in contralateral hip. During the recruitment period May 2006 – 
June 2011, 1709 hip fracture patients were screened; 917 (54%) were eligible (405 males, 
512 females). A total of 180 men and 182 women consented to participate in the study. 
Twenty-three participants were withdrawn (five participants failed to provide data at baseline 
and another 18 participants were removed from analytic sample as a result of an IRB-
requested post procedure audit), leaving a final sample of 339 (168 men, 171 women).
In-person assessments were conducted within 22 days of hospital admission (Mean=15.8, 
S.D.=5.0), typically after hospital discharge by research interviewers trained by a licensed 
neuropsychologist (LG). Fifty-five percent were conducted in rehabilitation or skilled 
nursing facilities, 35% at participant’s residence, and 10% while still hospitalized. For these 
analyses, 166 men and 168 women had one or more cognitive measures completed at the 
baseline assessment.
Measures
Cognition—Cognitive status was assessed using three standardized tests administered to 
all participants. Measures were selected to include those that have been well validated on 
patients with known neurologic disease (e.g., cerebrovascular disease, Alzheimer’s Disease) 
as well as normal aging populations; demonstrated good reliability and validity; and 
minimized participant burden. During all cognitive assessments, the potential interference 
from sensory deficits was minimized using standard neuropsychological examination 
strategies such as large print forms and making sure participants used glasses and hearing 
aids (supplemental magnifying glasses and/or sound amplifiers were provided as necessary).
The Modified Mini-Mental State Examination (3MS)16 is based on the Mini-Mental State 
Exam (MMSE).17 The 3MS modified the 0–30 scale through 4 additional items, some 
additional stimuli within items, and a more graded scoring to create a 0–100 scale. The 
original MMSE score can be derived from the 3MS. As is widely accepted, if a subject was 
unable to perform items for physical reasons, the mean was recomputed excluding those 
items not performed (rescaled back to 100). While varying cut points exist for the 3MS, a 
score below 78 is often considered cognitively impaired.18
The Trail-Making Test (Trails A & B)—Trails A is considered a task of visual search, 
sequencing, and psychomotor tracking speed while Trails B adds an element of executive 
control (set-switching) abilities.19 Both instruments were administered and scored as 
seconds to task completion (range 1–301) according to standard procedures.20 Higher scores

 indicate slower or worse responses. Scores of 301 (one second slower than maximum time) 
were assigned if not finished in five minutes.
The Hooper Visual Organization Test (HVOT)21 measures visual spatial analytic skills. For 
successful performance, the participant must identify common objects from fragmented 
visual information. Scores range from 0–30, with higher scores indicative of better 
cognition.
Demographics and health status—Demographic and other descriptive information 
about diagnosis of dementia or delirium were obtained from hospital medical chart 
abstraction or interview with participants or surrogates. Vital status and date of death were 
ascertained through monthly telephone calls to the participant or proxy.
Statistical Methods
Baseline differences were analyzed by sex using Students’ t-tests (for continuous variables) 
and chi-square tests (for dichotomous variables). Linear regression models were used to 
determine whether sex differences remained after controlling for dementia diagnosis, 
delirium (noted in chart), age, race, educational attainment, and Charlson comorbidity score. 
Proportional hazards models were used to estimate hazard ratios (HRs) for death in the 
initial 6 months (183 days) by each cognitive variable as separate models and as a combined 
model with sex and all cognitive measures controlling for pre-existing dementia, delirium, 
and Charlson comorbidity. All analyses were performed using SAS 9.3 (SAS Institute, Inc, 
Cary, NC).
Results
Among the 166 men and 168 women in this sample, baseline differences were observed for 
most cognitive measures but few demographics (Table 1). Both groups were predominately 
white, with an average age over 80, and educational level above high school graduation. 
Men had significantly higher Charlson comorbidity scores (p<.001). Men had a higher 
frequency of diagnosed dementia (17%) than women (11%), although this difference was 
not statistically significant. Overall, fewer than 10% of the sample had delirium identified in 
the hospital chart.
Men were more impaired on most cognitive measures, including the 3MS, MMSE, HVOT, 
and Trails A (p<.05) (Table 1). Twenty-nine percent of men scored in the cognitively 
impaired range on the 3MS (<78), compared to 16% of women. For HVOT, 33% of men and 
21% of women scored in the most impaired category (HVOT<15). Men were slower on 
Trails A, with 48% scoring over 78 seconds compared to 35% of women. These statistically 
significant differences between men and women remained for MMSE (p=.03) and HVOT 
(p=.02) after controlling for pre-existing dementia, in-hospital delirium, Charlson 
comorbidity score, age, education, and race (3MS p=.17, Trails A p=.15). Men and women 
did not differ statistically on the Trails B, nor on any of the derived scores from Trails A to B 
(the delta or the ratio scores). Even among the subsample with no history of dementia 
(bottom of Table 1), significant differences remained between men and women after hip 
fracture for 3MS, MMSE, Trails A, and HVOT.

 The overall proportion of hip fracture patients who died within 6 months of fracture, and 
breakdowns by sex and 3MS scores, are presented in Table 2. Among men with impaired 
3MS scores (3MS<78), 32% died within 6 months, compared to 15% among cognitively 
impaired women and 11% among non-impaired men. In contrast, women without cognitive 
impairment (3MS>=78) had a 6-month mortality of 2%.
In proportional hazards models, 3MS, HVOT, and Trails B were significantly associated 
with mortality (p<.05) (see Table 3). Among the cognitive measures, 3MS was the most 
predictive of mortality, even when controlling for other cognitive scales and when dementia 
diagnosis, delirium, and comorbidity were controlled for (3MS HR=0.95). Despite the 
impact of cognition, the mortality rates were still statistically significantly higher among 
men (HR=3.3) when controlling for cognition, although the effect was no longer significant 
(HR=2.5, p=.12) when adjusting for pre-existing dementia, in-hospital delirium, and 
comorbidity in addition to all cognitive variables. There were no significant sex by cognition 
interaction effects (all p>.10).
Discussion
In this sample of men and women after hip fracture, men had more cognitive impairment at 
baseline (within 22 days of hospital admission) and higher 6-month mortality. The higher 
mortality for men remained after controlling for all the cognitive measures and was large 
(although not statistically significant) after controlling for history of Alzheimer’s disease or 
dementia, delirium from hospital chart, and comorbidities. We believe the loss of 
significance in this final model for sex may be an issue of collinearity or power, as the effect 
of sex was still significant when controlling for just 3MS and dementia, delirium, and 
comorbidity (without the other cognitive measures) or when controlling for all the cognitive 
measures without the diagnoses variables.
It is well known that dementia, delirium, and overall cognitive status impact recovery from 
hip fracture.13,22 The impact of sex differences and cognition on mortality in hip fracture 
patients is less well known. Tseng and colleagues23 examined recovery patterns among 162 
hip fracture patients in Taiwan and found that men and those with low MMSE scores had 
worse recovery. Samuelsson et al.15 examined 2,134 hip fracture patients in Sweden, and 
while they found no sex differences in cognition (using the Short Portable Mental Status 
Questionnaire), they identified a stronger sex effect on 4-month mortality among those with 
cognitive dysfunction, such that only 6% of men and 6% women without cognitive 
dysfunction died, while 31% of men with cognitive dysfunction died compared to 19% in 
women with cognitive dysfunction. In contrast, our study failed to detect interaction effects 
of sex with cognition, but did find main effects of both sex and cognition on mortality, such 
that the highest mortality was among men with cognitive impairment on the 3MS (where 
32% of men died within 6 months compared to 15% among women). In contrast, our female 
hip fracture participants without 3MS cognitive impairment (3MS>=78) had a 6-month 
mortality of 2%.
High levels of cognitive impairment were observed for both men and women in this sample. 
To our knowledge, no previous hip fracture studies used this cognitive battery. Although

 previous work using the MMSE found 42% or more obtained scores below 24 while 
hospitalized;13,24 average MMSE scores in this study were higher: 25 (men) and 26 
(women). In contrast, one study of 30 men versus 130 women using the Short Portable 
Mental Status Questionnaire (SPMSQ)25 found more impairment among women (27%) 
compared to men (20%)(p=.08) after hip fracture. This finding may be due to the fact that 
the SPMSQ assesses fewer cognitive domains than the MMSE.
On average, our sample of hip fracture patients had higher cognitive impairment scores than 
those seen in other samples of persons over age 80 without hip fracture. For example, 
average 3MS scores for community-dwelling adults over 80 with a high school education 
have been shown to range from 85 (Cache county men ages 90+)26 to 92 (MrOS study of 
men).27 Scores in patients in this study, with an average education of 13 years, were an 
average 86 for women and 82 for men. When those with dementia were excluded, the means 
were 89 for women and 85 for men, which was more in line with community-dwelling 
estimates.
The average HVOT scores in our sample were16.7 for men and 18.6 for women. Walsh, 
Lichtenberg, and Rowe (1997)28 reported HVOT means for 144 geriatric rehabilitation 
patients ages 60–95 of 18.6 for cognitively intact, 14.9 for mildly cognitively impaired, and 
12.5 for moderately to severely impaired. Our scores for female hip fracture participants 
were within the normal range for geriatric rehabilitation patients, but the scores for men 
(17.0 when excluding dementia) were consistent with a mild level of cognitive 
impairment.28
For Trail-Making tests, we found that men were significantly slower than women on Trails 
A, (97 seconds versus 81 seconds, respectively), which measures visual search, sequencing, 
and motor tracking speed. In contrast, there was no significant difference between sexes for 
Trails B (219 for men versus 201 for women), which incorporates an element of executive 
control (set shifting) to the procedure. Previous research on community-dwelling elderly 
ages 80+ has found a mean of 56 seconds for Trails A (170 seconds for Trail B).29 Other 
studies have found slower speeds, with scores of 67 to 73 seconds for Trails A,30,31 and 
scores of 12327 to 255 seconds30 for Trails B. Taking this into consideration, the means in 
both of our sex groups remained much higher (slower) for Trails A, even after excluding 
those with dementia.
There are some limitations to be noted in our study. We had no pre-fracture assessments of 
cognitive function and thus our estimates of pre-fracture dysfunction were limited to chart 
diagnoses of dementia. We also relied upon chart recording for documentation of in-hospital 
delirium. Since hospital charts are known to under report dementia and delirium,32,33 the 
possibility exists that our hip fracture sample included people with unrecognized dementia 
and delirium.
Our research is the first to document cognitive deficits beyond general cognition in hip 
fracture patients by including specific measures of visual search, sequencing, and tracking 
speed as well as visual spatial and analytic skills. The average age of hip fracture patients 
was 82–83, and normative data are limited among the over 80 age group, especially for those

 who were recently hospitalized. Overall, our sample demonstrated a higher level of 
impairment than the currently published literature in this age group. The deficits in visual 
spatial and analytic skills, as well as visual tracking and perceptual motor speed, raise the 
possibility that capacities beyond memory and general cognitive impairment require 
management and/or intervention in geriatric rehabilitation after hip fracture.28 It is known 
that delirium persists longer in older patients,13 and this research suggests that monitoring 
cognition after hospital discharge may be helpful in identifying patients at risk for short-term 
mortality. Additional information on the cognitive domains assessed in this study might also 
provide guidance for rehabilitation and safety goals, including navigating stairs, curbs, or 
other obstacles or when to resume driving.
Our study also adds to the growing body of evidence that finds men have more cognitive 
difficulties and higher mortality than women after a hip fracture. Given the importance of 
cognitive function for understanding and participating in therapeutic interventions, our study 
serves to emphasize the need to consider how men and women differ after hip fracture and 
how understanding these sex differences as well as the specific nature of cognitive deficits 
may inform design of future interventions for both men and women after hip fracture.
