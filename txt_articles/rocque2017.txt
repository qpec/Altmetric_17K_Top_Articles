IMPORTANCE Lay navigators in the Patient Care Connect Program support patients with
cancer from diagnosis through survivorship to end of life. They empower patients to engage
in their health care and navigate them through the increasingly complex health care system.
Navigation programs can improve access to care, enhance coordination of care, and
overcome barriers to timely, high-quality health care. However, few data exist regarding the
financial implications of implementing a lay navigation program.
OBJECTIVE To examine the influence of lay navigation on health care spending and resource
use among geriatric patients with cancer within The University of Alabama at Birmingham
Health System Cancer Community Network.
DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS This observational study from January 1, 2012, through
December 31, 2015, used propensity score–matched regression analysis to compare quarterly
changes in the mean total Medicare costs and resource use between navigated patients and
nonnavigated, matched comparison patients. The setting was The University of Alabama at
Birmingham Health System Cancer Community Network, which includes 2 academic and 10
community cancer centers across Alabama, Georgia, Florida, Mississippi, and Tennessee.
Participants were Medicare beneficiaries with cancer who received care at participating
institutions from 2012 through 2015.
EXPOSURES The primary exposure was contact with a patient navigator. Navigated patients
were matched to nonnavigated patients on age, race, sex, cancer acuity (high vs low),
comorbidity score, and preenrollment characteristics (costs, emergency department visits,
hospitalizations, intensive care unit admissions, and chemotherapy in the preenrollment
quarter).
MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES Total costs to Medicare, components of cost, and resource
use (emergency department visits, hospitalizations, and intensive care unit admissions).
RESULTS In total, 12 428 patients (mean (SD) age at cancer diagnosis, 75 (7) years; 52.0%
female) were propensity score matched, including 6214 patients in the navigated group and
6214 patients in the matched nonnavigated comparison group. Compared with the matched
comparison group, the mean total costs declined by $781.29 more per quarter per navigated
patient (β = −781.29, SE = 45.77, P < .001), for an estimated $19 million decline per year
across the network. Inpatient and outpatient costs had the largest between-group quarterly
declines, at $294 and $275, respectively, per patient. Emergency department visits,
hospitalizations, and intensive care unit admissions decreased by 6.0%, 7.9%, and 10.6%,
respectively, per quarter in navigated patients compared with matched comparison patients
(P < .001).
CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE Costs to Medicare and health care use from 2012 through
2015 declined significantly for navigated patients compared with matched comparison
patients. Lay navigation programs should be expanded as health systems transition to
value-based health care.

D
espite spending more per patient than any other coun-
try, the quality of US health care remains suboptimal.1
This paradox has led to growing emphasis on the need
for value-based health care, which is characterized by the
“Triple Aim” of improved patient experience of care, better
health of the population, and reduced per capita cost of health
care.2 In cancer care delivery, costs are expected by 2020 to
rise to $173 billion per year,3 in part because of the aging popu-
lation and high expense associated with caring for geriatric
patients.4 Innovative solutions are needed to transform the
health care system.
The fragmented nature of US health care delivery and
the lack of care coordination between care settings are barri-
ers to high-quality, efficient care.5 Since the initial reports of
lay navigation by Freeman,6,7 patient navigation programs
have been used to improve access to cancer care, coordinate
care delivery, and address barriers to achieving timely, high-
quality health care.8-15 Navigation programs are expanding
nationally and are being included as part of the Commission
on Cancer accreditation,8,10 yet the optimal target popula-
tion and strategy for delivering navigation services are not
defined.8 Historically, most navigation programs focused on
early detection and the initial management of cancer.6-8,10,11
Few data exist on navigation for patients with cancer
throughout the cancer care continuum (initial, survivorship,
and end of life). Evidence for the influence of navigation
across this continuum is needed, including for patients at
end of life, who are likely to have high symptom burden,
experience hospitalizations, and incur higher medical
costs.16-18 Providing navigation for patients with cancer
across the continuum will require workforce expansion.
Although nurses are the primary staff for many navigation
programs, lay (nonclinical) navigation programs are becom-
ing increasingly prevalent as a low-cost strategy to meet the
demand for navigation service in the United States.8,19
As part of a Center for Medicare & Medicaid Innovation
award, we developed and implemented a lay navigation
model, the Patient Care Connect Program (PCCP), for older
Medicare beneficiaries with cancer across The University of
Alabama at Birmingham (UAB) Health System Cancer Com-
munity Network (CCN).20 The goal of the program was to
meet the Triple Aim2 of improved health care, better health,
and lower costs by integrating lay navigators into the care
team. The PCCP navigators aim to proactively identify
patient needs, connect patients with resources, coordinate
care, and empower patients to take a more active role in
their health care. The introduction of lay navigation within
the CCN also served as a practice transformation. Naviga-
tors, health care personnel, and administrators were
engaged in discussions about health care delivery through
analysis of shared data.20 We hypothesized that the PCCP
navigation would result in lower health care costs and
decreased use of costly medical care, such as emergency
department (ED) visits, hospitalizations, and intensive care
unit (ICU) admissions. In this analysis, we evaluated the
influence of the PCCP by examining trends in these out-
comes for navigated patients compared with a matched
group of patients who did not receive navigation services.
Methods
Study Design and Oversight
We conducted a secondary analysis of Medicare administra-
tive claims data from January 1, 2012, through December 31,
2015, for all older adults with cancer who received care within
the CCN. Our objective was to compare costs and health care
use for those receiving the PCCP lay navigation services and a
matched cohort of patients who did not. The following institu-
tional review boards at the UAB and each of the participating
CCN sites approved the evaluation of the PCCP: Fort Walton
Beach Medical Center, Fort Walton Beach, Florida; Gulf Coast
Regional Medical Center, Panama City, Florida; Marshall Medi-
cal Center, Albertville, Alabama; Mitchell Cancer Institute,
Mobile, Alabama; Memorial Hospital, Chattanooga, Tennes-
see; Northeast Alabama Regional Medical Center, Anniston;
Northside Hospital Cancer Institute, Atlanta, Georgia; Russell
Medical Center, Alexander City, Alabama; Southeast Alabama
Medical Center, Dothan; Singing River Health System, Pasca-
goula, Mississippi; and the UAB Comprehensive Cancer Cen-
ter.NavigationisconsideredastandardofcarewithinthePCCP,
and no patient informed consent was necessary to enroll pa-
tients in the PCCP. A waiver of consent was granted by the UAB
institutional review board to conduct this secondary analysis.
Study Population
ThesourcepopulationincludedMedicarebeneficiaries65years
or older with primary Medicare Part A and B insurance cover-
age and a cancer diagnosed from 2012 through 2015 within the
CCN. Patients with health maintenance organization cover-
age were excluded. The CCN includes 2 academic and 10 com-
munity cancer centers of varying size and practice structure
located in Alabama, Georgia, Florida, Mississippi, and
Tennessee.20ImplementationofthePCCPbeganinMarch2013
at the UAB site, and all sites were navigating patients by Oc-
tober 2013. Within the PCCP, patients were identified through
a combination of ED or hospital census report review, clini-
cian referral, and self-referral. The nurse site manager or head
navigator would review these lists and assign patients to navi-
gators to initiate contact. Priority was given to high-risk pa-
tients, including those with metastatic cancer, high-
Key Points
Question What is the influence of lay navigation on cost and
resource use of older adults with cancer?
Findings In this observational study, we used regression analysis
to compare changes in quarterly Medicare costs and health care
use between patients navigated in the Patient Care Connect
Program and a propensity score–matched group of nonnavigated
patients. Compared with matched nonnavigated patients,
outcomes declined more per quarter for navigated patients,
including costs by $781.29, emergency department visits by 6.0%,
hospitalizations by 7.9%, and intensive care unit admissions by
10.6%.
Meaning Lay navigation programs should expand as health
systems transition to value-based health care.

morbidity cancers (eg, pancreatic, ovarian, and lung), high-
risk comorbidities (eg, diabetes, heart failure, and chronic
obstructive pulmonary disease), or history of ED visit or hos-
pitalization in the prior month.
For this analysis, we defined 2 groups for comparison, the
navigated group and a nonnavigated, matched comparison
group. The navigated group included patients assigned to a
navigator between March 2013 and June 2015. The matched
comparison group was selected from nonnavigated patients
diagnosed between January 2012 and June 2015. We as-
signed a pseudo-enrollment date to patients in the compari-
son group based on the frequency distributions of time from
diagnosis to enrollment observed for the PCCP group.21 We re-
stricted the analysis population to patients who had at least 1
quarter of observation before and 2 quarters of observation af-
ter the enrollment or pseudo-enrollment date. We further re-
stricted the comparison group to patients who had a pseudo-
enrollment date before death and before June 2015.
PCCP Navigation
DetailsofthePCCP,includingpatientselection,navigatortrain-
ing, and interventions, have been previously described.20,22
Briefly,laynavigatorswerehiredfromwithinthecommunityand
wererequiredtohaveabachelor’

clinicians, such as nurses or social workers. The mean naviga-
tor caseload was 152 patients per quarter.23 Navigator activities
wereguidedbydistressscreeningsthatassessedpractical,infor-
mational, financial, familial, emotional, spiritual, and physical
concerns.22 Assistance on any distress item reported was pro-

levelsguidedthefrequencyoffurthercontact.Inaddition,high
levels of distress (≥4 on the distress thermometer) triggered a
higher level of intervention by the nurse site manager or the
healthcareprofessional.22Navigatorsalsoencouragedpatients
to telephone them or the clinic before going to the ED.20
Data Source
Data on cancer type, stage, and date of diagnosis were re-
ceivedfromthelocalcancerregistriesofthe12CCNsites.Medi-
care Part A and B claims data from inpatient, outpatient, phy-
sicianvisits(carrier),homehealth,durablemedicalequipment,
skilled nursing facility, and hospice claims from 2012 through
2015 were extracted from the Centers for Medicare & Medic-
aid Services Chronic Condition Data Warehouse. Medicare Part
D data were not available for this study.
Outcomes
The primary outcome was Medicare costs per beneficiary per
quarter (ie, amounts paid by Medicare for all care received, ex-
cluding Part D prescription drugs). Secondary outcomes in-
cluded (1) source of cost (inpatient, outpatient, physician vis-
its [carrier], home health, durable medical equipment, skilled
nursingfacility,andhospiceclaims)and(2)healthcareresource
use, as defined by the number of ED visits, hospitalizations, or
ICU admissions in each quarter. Health Care Financing Admin-
istration Common Procedural Coding System codes used to
identify outcomes are listed in the eTable in the Supplement.
Matching
We matched groups using propensity scores with the follow-
ing covariates: age at diagnosis, race, sex, cancer acuity (high
vs low), phase of care, comorbidity score, baseline cost of care,
baseline treatment with chemotherapy, and baseline ED and
ICU use. Race was obtained from claims data and categorized
as white, black, or other. Cancer acuity was categorized as high
(brain,pancreatic,ovarian,lung,andheadandneckoranystage
IV cancer) or not. Cancer stage was defined using the Surveil-
lance, Epidemiology, and End Results staging. Comorbid con-
ditions were abstracted from claims data from 2012 through
2015 and classified using a weighted score of 0, 1, 2 to 3, or
4 or higher based on the Klabunde modification for
comorbidities.24-26 We defined the following 3 distinct phases
of care at time of enrollment or pseudo-enrollment: initial, sur-
vivorship, and end of life.27 The end-of-life phase was defined
as the last 6 months of life. The initial phase included patients
within1yearofdiagnosiswhowerenotwithinthelast6months
oflife.Thesurvivorshipphasespannedtheperiodbetweenthe
initial and end-of-life phases. Baseline costs, receipt of che-
motherapy, and resource use were calculated for the quarter
before enrollment or pseudo-enrollment to account for pa-
tients with inherent high use from unmeasured factors.
Once the matched comparison group was identified, we
assessed the suitability of the match by examining the over-
lap of the propensity scores to verify the common support and
covariate balance and by using 2-sample t tests and χ2 tests to
evaluate the between-group differences in estimates and pro-
portions. The procedure was repeated varying the covariates
used until we obtained overlapping propensity scores with
similar proportions of covariates.
Return on Investment
Salaries, including administrative support for the PCCP navi-
gators, ranged from $33 400 to $42 300 per year, and the mean
navigator caseload was 152 patients per quarter.20 For the re-
turn on investment, the mean annual salary of $37 850 with
28.0% for fringe benefits, for a total of $48 448, was consid-
ered the investment. The return was calculated based on a
mean caseload per quarter of 152 patients per navigator mul-
tiplied by the difference in the mean decline in Medicare costs
of navigated patients compared with nonnavigated patients.
Statistical Analysis
We described characteristics for all beneficiaries in the source
population, the navigated group, and the matched nonnavi-
gated comparison group. We used repeated-measures gener-
alized linear models to evaluate trends in total cost based on
the following covariates: group assignment (group), quarters
after enrollment (time), calendar time, and the interaction be-
tween group and time. The primary coefficient of interest was
the group × time interaction. Furthermore, we examined the
differences in the mean quarterly reductions for each type of
cost in the following separate generalized linear models: in-
patient, outpatient, physician visits (carrier), home health,
skilled nursing facility, and hospice. Generalized linear mod-
els with the Poisson distribution and log link function with the
same set of covariates were used to estimate incidence rate ra-

Medicare Costs
We observed statistically significant group × time interac-
tions for Medicare costs and health care use (Table 2). Costs
for the navigated group started higher but declined faster than
the matched comparison group by $781.29 more per quarter
per navigated patient (P < .001), for an estimated $19 million
declineperyearacrossthenetwork,ultimatelybecominglower
for navigated patients after 6 quarters (Figure 2A). Inpatient
and outpatient costs had the largest between-group quar-
terly declines, at $294 and $275, respectively, per patient. The
greatest mean quarterly cost declines were observed for inpa-
tient costs, which decreased by $522 and $198, respectively,
per quarter per patient for navigated and matched compari-
son groups (Figure 3). Quarterly reductions per patient were
alsoobservedforoutpatientcosts($473forthenavigatedgroup
and $194 for the matched comparison group) and physician
visit (carrier) costs ($339 for the navigated group and $129 for
the matched comparison group), while hospice costs in-
creased ($39 for the navigated group and $36 for the matched
comparison group) for navigated patients.
Resource Use
We observed decreases in resource use for the navigated group
compared with the matched comparison group (Table 2). The
group × time interactions indicate that, compared with the
matchedcomparisongroup,thenavigatedgroup’

quarter (IRR, 0.92; 95% CI, 0.90-0.94; P < .001), and ICU ad-
missions were reduced by 10.6% more per quarter (IRR, 0.90;
95% CI, 0.86-0.94; P < .001). Figure 2B, C, and D show the
changes in predicted counts (per 1000 observations) for ED
visits, hospitalizations, and ICU admissions.

$48 448 (salary and fringe benefits), we estimated a return on
investment of 1:10.
Discussion
In this population of geriatric patients with cancer, we ob-
served substantial reductions in resource use and cost for navi-
gated patients in the PCCP compared with matched nonnavi-
gated patients. This influence was observed for costs of
hospitalizations, outpatient visits, and physician visits.
Despite clear benefits to patients from navigation,10-15 pro-
grams have struggled with sustainable methods because of a
lack of financial support. The estimated potential 1:10 return
on investment of the PCCP helps make a financial case to or-
ganizational leadership for sustainability of navigation pro-
grams. The observed benefit is likely because of the PCCP ap-
proach of targeting high-risk, high-cost patients and patients
who have unmet needs, which is reflected in the differences
observed between the navigated and nonnavigated patients
in our study. Navigators are uniquely positioned to meet the
needs of these high-risk patients and help them better use out-
patient resources. Unlike physicians and nursing staff, navi-
gators are not limited by the traditional model of clinic-based
care. They engage patients during clinical encounters with

Our findings support this hypothesis.
While we observed cost declines across all use sources,
costs increased for hospice use, which may be secondary to

Limitations
There are several limitations to the interpretation of findings
in our study. First, there was no random assignment to the
PCCP and the comparison group, and high-risk patients were
targeted for the PCCP enrollment. To minimize the differ-
ences in patient characteristics because of the lack of random-
ization and the targeting of high-risk patients for enrollment,
we used propensity score matching and considered use be-
fore enrollment (or a pseudo-enrollment date for the compari-
son group). However, unmeasured confounding factors, such
as patient social support and level of engagement in their
health, may also influence the likelihood of navigation, as well
as patient outcomes. The intensity of navigation services also
varied by patient and by need, making it challenging to iden-
tify the benefit for individual patients. In addition, navigated
patients often had missing cancer stage information, particu-
larly in the initial phase of care, because the tumor registries
lack real-time case abstraction.
Second,the12institutionsshareddata,continuouslymoni-
tored claims-based outcomes, and received reports and edu-
cation by the PCCP leadership team based on navigator-
collected and claims data.20 The creation of this learning
collaborative may have influenced cost and resource use de-
clines because of local culture shifts that occurred as a result
of the PCCP. Although culture change was not systematically
evaluated, the UAB leadership team received anecdotal re-
ports of health systems changing telephone protocols, add-
ing same-day sick visits, and redirecting charitable contribu-
tions to navigator-identified patient needs.
Third,thelong-terminfluenceofthePatientProtectionand
Affordable Care Act on health care use and cost is yet to be de-
termined. Analysis of trends in health care spending suggests
that costs are rising less rapidly, but reductions in cost have not
been reported nationally.34 To attempt to address this limita-
tion, we adjusted for calendar time in our regression models.
Evenwiththeencouragingcosttrendsreportedherein,the
PCCP is not sustainable within the current fee-for-service pay-
ment model, which does not reward coordination of care.35
Despite the requirement to provide navigation services for
American College of Surgeons accreditation,36 such services
are not billable, and savings to Medicare from decreased use
lead to decreased revenue for the health system. Without tran-
sition to a value-based payment system that aligns payment
with high-quality, cost-efficient, and connected delivery of
care, health systems will not be incentivized to expand or even
implement navigation services. However, given the apparent
success of the PCCP, the ongoing Centers for Medicare &
Medicaid Services Oncology Care Model,37 and the proposed
Patient-Centered Oncology Payment model by the American
Society of Clinical Oncology,38 change in payment models
appear to be upon us.
Conclusions
There was a significant decline in costs and resource use for
navigated geriatric patients with cancer within the PCCP com-
pared with matched nonnavigated patients. Overall, cost re-
ductions were driven by substantial declines in hospitaliza-
tions and clinic-based services. This model has the potential
to reach the Triple Aim2 of improved health care, better health,
and lower costs and significantly enhanced health care deliv-
ery in the United States as health systems transition to value-
based health care.
