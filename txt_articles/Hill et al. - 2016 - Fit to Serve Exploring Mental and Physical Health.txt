Abstract
Purpose: Although transgender people are currently excluded from enlistment and discharged from service
based on medical and psychological fitness policies, the current mental and physical health of transgender
active-duty U.S. military personnel and veterans is poorly understood. The purpose of the current study was
to investigate the military histories, lifetime mental and physical health diagnoses, and transgender transition-
related health of transgender active-duty service members (ADSM) and veterans.
Methods: Participants were recruited through private LGBT military and veteran organizational listservs, snow-
ball sampling, and in-person recruitment to complete an anonymous and confidential self-administered online
questionnaire.
Results: A total of 106 transgender ADSM (n = 55) and veterans (n = 51) completed the questionnaire. Transgender
veterans were significantly older (44 mean years vs. 29.5 mean years, t = �6.23, p < 0.001). A greater percentage of
veterans than ADSM reported depression (64.6% vs. 30.9%, v2 = 11.68, p = 0.001) and anxiety (41.3% vs. 18.2%,
v2 = 6.54, p = 0.011). In addition, 15.9% of veterans versus 1.8% of ADSM (v2 = 6.53, p = 0.011) had been diagnosed
with a substance abuse disorder. There were no significant differences in lifetime physical health conditions; how-
ever, veterans reported a higher body–mass index than ADSM (28.4 vs. 24.9, t = �3.85, p < 0.001). For both groups,
mental and physical health problems were positively correlated with age and years of military service (r = 0.37–0.84,
p < 0.01). There were no significant differences between groups in transgender transition-related health.
Conclusion: Our data represent the first descriptive statistics of lifetime mental and physical health issues
among transgender ADSM and veterans. Data indicate that transgender ADSM report fewer lifetime mental
and physical health problems than transgender veterans. Taken together, our findings suggest that more
research, specifically among transgender ADSM, is needed to challenge the exclusion of transgender persons
from U.S. military service based on the presumption of poor mental or physical health.

Introduction
On June 8, 2015, the American Medical Association
(AMA) adopted a formal policy stating that there was
no medical rationale for excluding transgender individ-
uals from openly serving in the U.S. military.1 In so
doing, the AMA joined scholars, advocates, and mili-
tary personnel questioning the medical and psychologi-
cal fitness policies used to prohibit transgender persons
from service.2,3 Although current policy restrictions ex-
clude transgender people from enlistment and serving

 openly as transgender, population-level data suggest
that up to 15,500 transgender people are active-duty
service members (ADSM) or in the National Guard
or Reserve forces.4,5 In addition, data from the National
Transgender Discrimination Survey (NTDS) suggest
that transgender people are twice more likely to serve
in the military than members of the general popula-
tion.6 In response to the growing support for open
transgender service, the U.S. Defense Secretary Ashton
Carter announced in an official memorandum (date ef-
fective from July 13, 2015) that the U.S. military would
examine the current ban on open transgender service
over the next 180 days, with the anticipation of policy
reform expected in the spring of 2016.7
A number of scholars have questioned the justifica-
tion for using medical and psychological fitness policies
to exclude transgender individuals from military ser-
vice.2,3,8 Chief among these has been the American
Psychiatric Association’s prior classification of trans-
gender people as having a gender identity disorder
(GID), now classified as gender dysphoria (GD), in
the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disor-
ders (DSM).9 Although the DSM-5 definition of GD fo-
cuses on the level of distress an individual experiences
based on their discordant assigned birth sex and gender
identity,10 the Department of Defense’s current ‘‘Med-
ical Standards for Appointment, Enlistment, or Induc-
tion in the Military Services’’ bar service of any person
with a ‘‘Current or history of psychosexual conditions
(302) including but not limited to transsexualism, exhi-
bitionism, transvestism, voyeurism, and other para-
philia’’ (p. 48).11 As others have noted, the view that
transgender people have a pathological psychosexual
condition conflates transgender identity with mental
illness and distress2,3,12 and assumes that all transgen-
der people experience GD, which is not the case.2,12–14
To date, few health studies have been conducted
with transgender ADSM. In part, this reflects the diffi-
culties in collecting data under the current ban, as was
the case with studying lesbian, gay, and bisexual (LGB)
health under ‘‘Don’t Ask, Don’t Tell’’ (DADT), the mil-
itary policy that excluded LGB persons from open ser-
vice until 2011. However, a recent qualitative study
with 14 transgender ADSM found that having to con-
ceal one’s gender identity itself was a significant source
of distress.14 These findings are consistent with previ-
ous research on LGB veterans who served under
DADT, which found that concealment was positively
associated with experiences of depression and post-
traumatic stress disorder (PTSD).15
Currently, the health needs of both transgender
ADSM and veterans are poorly understood.16–18
Emerging research indicates that transgender veterans
experience poorer health than the general veteran pop-
ulation18,19 and encounter discrimination in the Veter-
ans Health Administration (VHA).20,21 For example,
Blosnich et al. examined VHA records from 2000 to
2011 and found that suicide risk among veterans diag-
nosed with GID was 20 times higher than the general
veteran population.19 To date, we know of no studies
specifically examining the mental and physical health
of transgender ADSM, or how their health compares
to transgender veterans.
Investigating the health of transgender ADSM is a
critical step in evaluating long-standing exclusion pol-
icies based on medical and psychological fitness.
Although transgender veteran health data have often
been used to extrapolate to ADSM,4 the degree to
which this group’s health may be generalized to trans-
gender ADSM is unknown. Furthermore, data on both
groups are necessary to develop appropriate standards
of care and subsequent health and mental health inter-
ventions. The past 4 years have seen marked changes in
the VHA directive governing transgender veteran
care.22 Although neither sex reassignment nor recon-
structive surgeries are covered, the directive guarantees
access to ‘‘hormonal therapy, mental healthcare, preop-
erative evaluation, and medically necessary postopera-
tive care.’’22 Notably, receiving a GD diagnosis is not
required to receive care that reflects one’s self-identified
gender.
The present study seeks to begin address existing
research gaps by examining the mental and physical
health, and military histories and experiences, of a
sample of transgender ADSM and veterans. Because
transgender veterans can access preoperative evalua-
tions, hormone therapy, and postoperative care, we
also document the base rates and intentions to undergo
transition-related health among both groups. Also,
transgender outness and family support are explored
for ADSM to better understand how concealment
and support are spread across ADSM military and fam-
ily networks.
Methods
Transgender ADSM were recruited through private
e-mail listservs hosted by Service members, Partners,
Allies for Respect and Tolerance for All (SPARTA)
and snowball sampling among the SPARTA members
(>4000 members). Transgender veterans were recruited

 using in-person recruitment at the 2013 Southern Com-
fort Conference in Atlanta, GA, and through snowball
sampling using the Transgender American Veterans
Association (TAVA) website and e-mail listserv. Data
were collected through an anonymous or confidential
(depending on recruitment strategy) 30-min online
survey from September 2013 to September 2014. All par-
ticipants provided anonymous electronic informed con-
sent and were given the option to receive a $10 gift card.
Written informed consent was waived for this study to
protect participant identities. All procedures were ap-
proved by the university’s institutional review board.
Measures
Sociodemographic variables.
Participants reported their
age, gender identity, sexual orientation, and sexual
attraction.
Military history.
Participants reported their military
branch of service, highest rank/grade served (e.g., E-,
O-), and number of years in service.
Lifetime diagnosed mental and physical health
problems.
ADSM and veterans reported lifetime di-
agnoses of the following: depression, anxiety, PTSD,
substance abuse, psychological adjustment issues,
back problems, knee problems, asthma, upper respira-
tory disease, endocrine disorder, chronic obstructive
pulmonary disease, osteoporosis/osteopenia, neurolog-
ical conditions, rheumatoid arthritis, glaucoma, cata-
racts, lung disease, cardiovascular disease, congenital
anomalies, and cancer (0 = no, 1 = yes). Additional
medical health items included current height and
weight, calculated as body–mass index (BMI), past
year hospitalizations, and current medical coverage.
Transition-related health.
Transition-related medical
health history examined current use of hormone-
replacement therapy (HRT) and having undergone
gender reassignment surgery (GRS). For those who in-
dicated no transition-related healthcare, an additional
question assessing future GRS intentions was asked.
Response options were 0 = no, 1 = yes.
Outness and family support.
ADSM described their
degree of outness to immediate family, nonmilitary
friends, military within-unit friends, whole military
unit, commanding officer, and all other military per-
sonnel. Responses range from 0 = Not at all to 4 = Com-
pletely ‘‘out’’ and were recoded as 0 = Not Out/Limited
Outness, 1 = Out/Open. ADSM also described their
level of family support. Responses ranged from 0= Not
at all supportive to 3 = Very supportive and were recoded
as 0 = No/Low support, 1 = Moderate/High Support.
Data analysis
Descriptive statistics analyzed proportions and central
tendencies for all demographic and military character-
istics. Group comparisons were conducted using chi-
square and Fisher’s exact tests for binary categorical
variables and t-tests and Mann–Whitney U tests for
continuous variables. A Holm-modified Bonferroni
correction was applied with p < 0.025 criteria to the in-
terpretation of group comparisons for mental health,
physical health, BMI, hospitalizations, and transgender
transition-related health to account for familywise
error rates.23 In addition, bivariate correlations were
calculated for health, transition-related health, years
of service, and outness and family support. All data
were analyzed in SPSS 21.0.
Results
Participants
Table 1 depicts demographic and military characteris-
tics of the 106 participants. ADSM comprised 55 per-
sons aged 20–50 years, and veterans were 51 people
aged 21–71 years. Veterans were significantly older
than ADSM (Table 1). The most commonly selected
gender identity was transgender woman, with a signif-
icant difference in gender identity between ADSM and
veterans (v2 = 11.29, p = 0.02). There were no signifi-
cant differences in sexual attraction or orientation.
Among both groups, the majority identified as hetero-
sexual and only attracted to women.
As shown in Table 1, transgender ADSM and veterans
served in all branches of the military and at multiple
ranks and grades. There were no significant differences
for years of service, military branch, or highest rank/
grade served. In both groups, the majority had served,
or was currently serving, in the army, followed by the
navy. In addition, the majority in each group reported
E4 (e.g., Specialist or Corporal-Army; Petty Officer
Third Class-Navy) or E5 (e.g., Sergeant-Army; Petty Offi-
cer Second Class-Navy) as their highest rank of service.
Lifetime diagnosed mental and physical
health problems
Table 2 presents comparison data on mental and phys-
ical health. Depression and anxiety were the two most
commonly reported conditions, followed by PTSD. A
greater percentage of veterans than ADSM reported

 depression (64.6% vs. 30.9%, v2=11.68, p=0.001) and
anxiety (41.3% vs. 18.2%, v2=6.54, p=0.011). In addition,
15.9% of veterans versus 1.8% of ADSM (v2=6.53,
p=0.011) had been diagnosed with a substance abuse dis-
order. There were no differences in psychological adjust-
ment, and lifetime diagnoses of PTSD were not significant
after the Holm-modified Bonferroni correction.
Analyses of physical health revealed few differences.
Back and knee problems were the two most commonly
cited health problems. The only areas where signifi-
cant differences emerged were in BMI. Here, veterans
reported a higher BMI [mean (M) = 28.4] than did
ADSM (M = 24.9) (t = �3.84, p < 0.001). There were
no significant differences in reported hospitalization
in the past year. The majority of veterans (59.1%) re-
ceived a lifetime diagnosis of a health problem under
current veteran medical coverage. For ADSM, 47.7%
of lifetime diagnoses were made using U.S. military
medical coverage (i.e., TriCare).
Linear regression was conducted to account for age
differences when examining the association between mil-
itary status (ADSM/veteran) and lifetime mental and
physical health problems. Models suggested that military
status was marginally associated with lifetime mental
health problems (b = 0.197, p = 0.086), but not with life-
time physical health problems (b = 0.176, p = 0.861).
Transgender transition-related health
Although 47.8% of ADSM were currently on HRT,
only 4.4% had undergone GRS. However, 53.7% of
ADSM intended to have GRS in the future. For

 transgender veterans, 67.6% were currently on HRT.
Still, only 19.4% had undergone GRS and 35.7%
intended to have GRS in the future. There were no sig-
nificant differences for HRT and GRS intentions.
Although more veterans had undergone GRS than
ADSM, the difference was not significant after the
Holm-modified Bonferroni correction ( p = 0.047).
Transgender outness and family support
Transgender outness was assessed only among ADSM
as an indicator of identity concealment under the cur-
rent ban on open service (Table 3). A majority (72.2%)
of ADSM reported being out to immediate family
members and nonmilitary friends (69.4%). However,
only 16.2% were out to military within-unit friends.
Even fewer reported being out to their whole military
unit (8.1%), commanding officer (8.1%), and all other
military personnel (5.6%). Despite high levels of family
outness, only 37.8% of ADSM reported having moder-
ate to strong levels of family support.
Bivariate correlations
Table 4 depicts bivariate correlations among demo-
graphic characteristics, mental and physical health
problems, transition-related care, and outness and
family support for ADSM. Correlations revealed that
age, years of military service, mental health problems,
and physical health problems were all positively corre-
lated ( p < 0.05). More specifically, age was correlated
with having been diagnosed with any mental health
(r = 0.33,
p = 0.02)
and
physical
health
(r = 0.46,
p = 0.001) problems. Having been diagnosed with any
mental health problem also was correlated with diag-
noses of physical health problems (r = 0.55, p < 0.001),
alluding
to
co-occurring
health
problems.
For
transition-related care, current HRT use was negatively
correlated with being out to the whole military unit
(r = �0.34, p = 0.04) and one’s commanding officer
(r = �0.34, p = 0.04). Being out to military within-unit
friends was correlated with being out to the whole
military unit (r = 0.67, p < 0.001), commanding officer
(r = 0.67, p < 0.001), and all other military personnel
(r = 0.54, p = 0.001). Being out about transgender iden-
tity was correlated with having family support (r = 0.64,
p < 0.001).
For transgender veterans, age was correlated with
number of years of military service (r = 0.31, p = 0.03)
and having been diagnosed with any physical health
problems (r = 0.33, p = 0.04). As with ADSM, diagnoses
of mental and physical health problems were correlated
(r = 0.54, p < 0.001). Moreover, currently being on HRT
was correlated with having undergone GRS (r = 0.35,
p = 0.03).
Discussion
This study is one of the first to examine health differ-
ences between transgender ADSM and veterans. Find-
ings revealed that transgender ADSM and veterans

 represent the breadth of military service and branches,
a full spectrum of military ranks, and a wide range of
years of military service. Overall, ADSM indicated
few mental and physical health problems compared
to veterans. For both ADSM and veterans, physical
health was positively correlated with age and years of
service, indicating that as service members age and/or
continue to serve, the propensity for physical health
problems may increase. It is unknown if these prob-
lems reflect length of service and concomitant strain
under the current ban, declines associated with length
of service/deployment and/or age, or length of time ex-
posed to minority stressors. In general, our findings are
consistent with the larger body of data on the associa-
tion between length of service and poor health,24,25 and
point to the need to provide transgender ADSM and
veterans with health and mental health services that
meet their complex needs.
Overall, the ADSM and veterans in our sample were
relatively physically healthy. The two most commonly
cited physical health conditions, back and knee prob-
lems (e.g., musculoskeletal conditions), are a leading
cause of medical visits, hospitalizations, and lost duty
days among the broader military populations.26,27 In
the present study, the four most commonly cited
mental health problems, depression, anxiety, PTSD,
and substance use, also parallel the mental health of
nontransgender ADSM and veterans.28–31 Taken to-
gether, these results do not support the notion of
poor mental or physical health as primary grounds
for excluding or discharging transgender people from
active-duty service.
Data from nonmilitary transgender studies have
demonstrated a relationship between identity conceal-
ment and poor health.32 Although a large proportion of
ADSM were out to family and nonmilitary friends, few
were out to military friends, commanding officer, or
other personnel. At the same time, our data suggest
that some transgender ADSM are embedded in units
where their gender identity is known, as there were
high correlations between outness to within-unit
friends and one’s whole military unit. Although out-
ness was significantly correlated with being out to
one’s commander, the magnitude was much lower
and outness in the military was not correlated with
family outness. This pattern likely reflects the current
ban on open transgender service. In addition, the
higher proportion of ADSM out to family and friends
points to a high burden of identity concealment across
ADSM different social networks, which has been asso-
ciated with poor mental and physical health in other
sexual and gender minority populations.33
Our findings are consistent with qualitative research
with transgender ADSM, which has found that trans-
gender personnel are out and find acceptance among
some units and commanding officers.14 This pattern
also has been identified in research with LGB ADSM
and veterans, where studies indicated that many LGB
personnel were out and accepted in their units and that
disclosure of sexual orientation is associated with greater
unit cohesion, morale, and task completion.34–36 For ex-
ample, a recent study indicated that the DADT repeal ap-
pears to have had an overall positive impact on the
military.34
Limitations
Although this study provides initial insights on the
health of transgender ADSM and veterans, it is im-
portant to note its limitations. First, participants
comprised a convenience sample self-reporting cross-
sectional data; thus, causal inferences cannot be made
and findings may not generalize to the entire transgen-
der ADSM and veteran population. The present study
did not assess assigned birth sex, but rather relied on
self-identification. Given the small sample size, we are
unable to draw meaningful comparisons among sub-
sets of self-identified transgender men or women
ADSM. We also did not inquire the number of deploy-
ments among ADSM and veterans, which has been as-
sociated with mental and physical health problems.37
Although length of service may provide insights into
deteriorating health over time, the number and length
of deployments and dwell time between deployments
are important factors to consider in future research.24,25
In addition, our study relied on a self-reported check-
list of lifetime health diagnoses, rather than inventories
or validated measures of existing health conditions.
Furthermore, our questions regarding transgender
transition-related care were limited to the physical as-
pects of transgender transition (e.g., HRT, GRS). Addi-
tional research is needed to better understand the use of
transition-related
counseling
and
therapy
among
transgender ADSM and veterans.
We also did not examine how specific demographic
factors, such as race/ethnicity, income, and education,
were related to health. These factors were intentionally
omitted from the survey to limit identifying informa-
tion and offer increased confidentiality for study partic-
ipants, particularly for transgender ADSM. However,
we recognize that these data are important to obtain,

 as prior work has observed ethnoracial disparities
among transgender veterans.38 As with other primary
data on transgender samples, this study had a relatively
small sample size compared to larger secondary analy-
ses of transgender veterans.4,18–20 Thus, the current
sample is not representative of all transgender ADSM
and veterans, as no representative sample of either
group currently exists. Whereas ADSM are included
in the NTDS, reports of mental and physical health di-
agnoses that serve as the basis for subsequent research
on health needs and disparities are not included.19
Recruiting transgender ADSM remains a challenge
under the current ban. Similar to the restrictions im-
posed by DADT, researchers must use methods that
minimize participant harm (e.g., discharge).39 Thus,
our study represents one of the first to collect primary
data with this hard to reach and vulnerable population,
subsequent studies including the investigation con-
ducted by the U.S. Department of Defense Transgender
Service Member Working Group.7
Conclusion
An estimated 18 countries currently allow transgender
men and women to openly serve in the military.2,40 In
March 2015, Master Chief Petty Officer of the Navy
(AW/NAC) Mike Stevens indicated that transgender
people should be allowed to serve ‘‘if they meet the
Navy’s standards.’’41 More recently, Defense Secretary
Ashton Carter recently announced that the military an-
ticipates lifting the ban on transgender service at the
conclusion and recommendation of the Secretary of
Defense for Personnel and Readiness working group
investigation.42 Holding in abeyance the conflation of
transgender identity with a psychosexual condition
that requires psychiatric and/or psychological treat-
ment, our data do not indicate that transgender
ADSM report levels of lifetime mental or physical
health problems at rates that should necessarily bar
them from service. However, additional research spe-
cifically focused on larger samples of transgender
ADSM is needed to challenge the exclusion of trans-
gender persons from serving in the U.S. military
based on the presumption of poor mental or physical
health. Moreover, our data suggest that transgender
ADSM diverge from veterans on several important
health indicators. Although additional research is
needed, our study is one of the first to collect primary
data on a sample of transgender ADSM and lends sup-
port to an emerging consensus that transgender men
and women should be allowed to serve openly in the
U.S. military with their cisgender heterosexual and
LGB peers.2,4,6,13,20,43
