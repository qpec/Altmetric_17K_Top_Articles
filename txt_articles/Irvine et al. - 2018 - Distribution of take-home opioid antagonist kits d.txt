Summary
Background Illicit use of high-potency synthetic opioids has become a global issue over the past decade. This misuse 
is particularly pronounced in British Columbia, Canada, where a rapid increase in availability of fentanyl and other 
synthetic opioids in the local illicit drug supply during 2016 led to a substantial increase in overdoses and deaths. 
In response, distribution of take-home naloxone (THN) overdose prevention kits was scaled up (6·4-fold increase) 
throughout the province. The aim of this study was to estimate the impact of the THN programme in terms of the 
number of deaths averted over the study period.
Methods We estimated the impact of THN kits on the ongoing epidemic among people who use illicit opioids in British 
Columbia and explored counterfactual scenarios for the provincial response. A Markov chain model was constructed 
explicitly including opioid-related deaths, fentanyl-related deaths, ambulance-attended overdoses, and  uses of THN kits. 
The model was calibrated in a Bayesian framework incorporating population data between Jan 1, 2012, and Oct 31, 2016.
Findings 22 499 ambulance-attended overdoses and 2121 illicit drug-related deaths (677 [32%] deaths related to fentanyl) 
were recorded in the study period, mostly since January, 2016. In the same period, 19 074 THN kits were distributed. 
We estimate that 298 deaths (95% credible interval [CrI] 91–474) were averted by the THN programme. Of these 
deaths, 226 (95% CrI 125–340) were averted in 2016, following a rapid scale-up in distribution of kits. We infer a rapid 
increase in fentanyl adulterant at the beginning of 2016, with an estimated 2·3 times (95% CrI 2·0–2·9) increase from 
2015 to 2016. Counterfactual modelling indicated that an earlier scale-up of the programme would have averted an 
additional 118 deaths (95% CrI 64–207). Our model also indicated that the increase in deaths could parsimoniously be 
explained through a change in the fentanyl-related overdose rate alone.
Interpretation The THN programme substantially reduced the number of overdose deaths during a period of rapid 
increase in the number of illicit drug overdoses due to fentanyl in British Columbia. However, earlier adoption and 
distribution of the THN intervention might have had an even greater impact on overdose deaths. Our findings show 
the value of a fast and effective response at the start of a synthetic opioid epidemic. We also believe that multiple 
interventions are needed to achieve an optimal impact.

Introduction
Illicit synthetic opioid use has increased rapidly over 
recent years in North America,1,2 in part due to the large 
consumption of prescription opioids compared with 
other resource-rich countries.3,4 In British Columbia 
(a province in western Canada with a population of 
4·6 million), since late 2015, we have experienced a 
large increase in overdose and death events among 
people who use drugs with a particular emphasis on the 
synthetic opioid fentanyl,5 which is estimated to be 
between 50 and 100 times more potent than heroin.6
Misuse of any opioid can result in overdose leading to 
death or other health complications. However, due to its 
high potency relative to other opioids and drugs of 
abuse, illicit fentanyl poses a substantially higher threat 
to health. Illicit fentanyl is not regulated, which means 
the amount and type of fentanyl or other adulterants in 
an ingested dose is unknown to the user and can be 
highly variable. The range between effective and lethal 
dose can be much narrower in fentanyl analogues than 
in prescription-grade heroin.6 Individuals might also 
mistakenly take fentanyl products believing they are 
heroin, oxycodone, or another non-opioid substance, 
placing them at increased risk of an accidental overdose.7
Since 2015, British Columbia has seen a substantial 
increase in the number of fentanyl-detected illicit drug 
deaths compared with the rest of North America, with 
non-fentanyl-detected deaths remaining relatively static.5

This increase has taken place over a general background 
of increases in both licit and illicit opioid use, overdoses, 
and deaths. However, beginning in 2015 and more 
pronouncedly in 2016, the rates of fentanyl-linked deaths 
in the province increased by three times and 8·9 times, 
respectively, compared with average pre-2015 rates.5,6 
This increase is believed to be due to a shift in 
procurement patterns of illicit opioids to online and 
overseas manufacturers, leading to a greater amount of 
fentanyl in the supply. Additionally, in many contexts 
neither buyer nor seller is aware of the addition of 
fentanyl. Indeed, a 2016 study indicated fentanyl was 
present in 82% (sample size 922) of selected heroin 
samples at a Vancouver supervised injection site, where 
clients were offered the opportunity to test their drugs.8–10
In response to the escalating crisis, the provincial 
government and local health authorities proposed a 
number of strategies including the rapid expansion of a 
take-home naloxone (THN) kit programme.9 The 
programme began in 2012. Between Jan 1, 2012, and 
Oct 31, 2013, there were 85 documented cases of kits 
being used to reverse overdoses, with no deaths in these 
cases.11 THN kits have proven efficacy in reversing 
overdoses and have similarly been used in other settings 
as a first-line measure. They are estimated to be 
94% effective when administered by laypersons and have 
been shown to be cost-effective in certain jurisdictions.12–15 
As of Sept 30, 2017, 55 112 kits had been distributed to 
people who use drugs and their close personal contacts 
in British Columbia. The THN programme expanded in 
the context of ongoing provincial-wide treatment and a 
supervised consumption site in Vancouver. Overdose 
prevention sites have also been introduced around the 
province since Dec 8, 2016.
There are no estimates of how many deaths the THN 
programme has averted, including during the fentanyl-
misuse epidemic. Here, we apply a simple Markov chain 
model of overdoses and deaths linked to opioids, 
explicitly accounting for a variable proportion of fentanyl 
in the illicit drug circulation. The model was designed so 
that it could incorporate provincial overdose and death 
data from Jan 1, 2012, to Oct 31, 2016, where the main 
changing intervention was the expansion of the THN 
programme, and thus can be used to estimate the impact 
of the programme on mortality. We also estimate the 
impact of three alternative interventions through 
counterfactual modelling: earlier distribution of THN 
kits, reduction of the population potentially exposed 
to fentanyl (eg, as would be seen through other 
interventions such as increased addictions treatment or 
implementation of a prescription heroin programme), 
and prevention of the increase in fentanyl supply to the 
illicit market.
Methods
Data sources
Monthly data for fentanyl-linked illicit drug overdose 
deaths and total illicit drug overdose deaths (including 
fentanyl-related deaths) were obtained from Jan 1, 2012, 
to Oct 31, 2016, for the whole of the province from the 
Coroners Service of British Columbia.5,16 Fentanyl-linked 
deaths included cases where fentanyl was identified 
alone or in combination with other drugs, when drug 
overdose was the confirmed cause of death. Deaths were 
excluded if fentanyl had been prescribed or there was 
suspected self-harm. Post-mortem testing for fentanyl 
remained consistent throughout the entire study period 
and was tested for in every overdose death.
Research in context
Evidence before this study
Naloxone is an opiate antagonist that has been shown to be 
highly effective at reversing overdoses and averting deaths due to 
opioid overdose. From late 2015 to early 2016 there was an 
unprecedented increase in the availability of high potency 
synthetic opioids (especially fentanyl) in British Columbia. In the 
context of a large-scale fentanyl-driven epidemic it was not clear 
what impact could be expected for the take-home naloxone 
(THN) kit programme. We searched PubMed on May 27, 2017, 
with the search terms “naloxone” AND “fentanyl” AND 
“overdose” for publications from Jan 1, 2011, to May 27, 2017, 
restricted to English language, but with no restriction on 
geographical location. Of the four studies identified, none directly 
tried to estimate the effectiveness of a naloxone programme in 
the context of a sudden epidemic of overdose events.
Added value of this study
This is the first study to estimate the impact of a THN 
programme on the number of overdose deaths during an 
epidemic of fentanyl use. We use a simple mathematical model, 
calibrated to multiple sources of data on opioid overdoses and 
overdose deaths, to estimate the number of deaths averted 
through the British Columbia THN programme. These results 
will have important implications for other regions in Canada 
and the rest of the world that are seeing an increase in fentanyl 
in their illicit drug supply.
Implications of all available evidence
Our findings suggest that the British Columbia THN 
programme was effective at reducing the number of overdose-
related deaths during a large and rapidly developing synthetic 
opioid epidemic. Counterfactual modelling to project the 
impact of different interventions to the crisis showed that 
earlier distribution of THN kits could have had greater impact 
despite escalating fentanyl use. We find that multiple 
interventions will probably have the most impact in reducing 
the overall burden of such an epidemic.

Data for ambulance-attended overdoses were provided 
by the British Columbia Emergency Health Service as an 
extract from their Patient Care Report database. In these 
data, we defined an overdose following the definition 
used by the British Columbia Centre for Disease Control 
for illegal drug overdose surveillance:17 any ambulance-
attended event indicating the patient experienced an 
overdose of illegal substances, excluding alcohol or the 
patient’s own prescription drugs, and including those 
where naloxone was administered. These data do not 
distinguish between fentanyl-related and other opioid 
overdoses. Monthly numbers of ambulance-attended 
illicit drug overdoses were tabulated for the period 
Jan 1, 2012, to Oct 31, 2016.
THN 
kit 
programme 
data 
were 
gathered 
in 
two categories: the monthly number of kits distributed, 
and the number of kits replaced due to an overdose event. 
Details of how each of these different datasets were 
incorporated into our model are given in the next section.
Weather data were extracted from a publicly available 
data source for Vancouver, British Columbia.18 A mean of 
the average daily feels-like temperature and precipitation 
were extracted and converted into monthly temperatures 
and precipitation. The feels-like temperature was used 
since this is more indicative of how an individual would 
experience the weather.
Model design
We designed a model of the population of people who 
use drugs in the form of a Markov chain model (figure 1).19 
People who use drugs are modelled as being in one of 
three states: individuals at risk of overdose (state F; 
ie, they are using opioids from a drug supply that can 
potentially contain fentanyl or other opioids at unknown 
concentrations); individuals not at risk of overdose 
(state R; ie, they are compliant with opioid substitution 
therapy or are otherwise not in contact with the general 
supply); and individuals who have recently relapsed into 
illicit drug use and are hence at increased risk from both 
fentanyl and non-fentanyl overdose (state H).20 Since we 
had no evidence of substantial changes in the population 
of at-risk individuals over the study period, we simplified 
the model by fixing the proportion of individuals in each 
category. Numbers were informed from population 
estimates of people who use drugs and the number 
of individuals enrolled in the provincial methadone 
programme.21
A major challenge in this work is that the proportion of 
opioid users who will be exposed to a clinically significant 
concentration of fentanyl in the illicit drug supply (fentanyl-
related overdose risk) each month is unknown. We 
addressed this by modelling the proportion as a latent 
(unobserved) time series, describing an increase in the rate 
of overdoses occurring among people in states F and H of 
the model. This time series was modelled as a random 
walk with drift. This model assumes that month-to-month 
changes in the proportion of fentanyl in the supply were 
due to a constant drift along with a monthly variability. 
This latent series incorporates all effects that would lead to 
a change in overdose risk, such as behaviour changes in 
response to the previous month’s overdose deaths. The 
model is therefore agnostic to reasons why people who use 
drugs might have taken fentanyl.
The monthly numbers of overdoses in the population 
can be modelled by multiplying the numbers of people in 
each state (F and H) by the monthly risk of overdose due 
to the regular drug supply and the fentanyl-including 
supply, with each risk weighted by the proportion of 
contact with the fentanyl supply. We also applied an 
increased risk of overdose to individuals in the relapse 
group H.
The impact of the entire THN programme was 
incorporated into our model in two ways. First, we 
included the known cumulative number of kits in 
circulation each month and converted this number into a 
probability that a THN kit was used during an overdose 
event. This calculation was achieved by dividing the 
number of kits in circulation by the at-risk population 
size and multiplying by an effectiveness parameter. The 
effectiveness parameter includes all aspects of kit 
effectiveness in the field: kit loss, availability for use, 
proper application, and success in reversing an overdose. 
Second, the model included the number of used THN 
kits returned for replacement; these were kits that had 
been used due to an overdose.
We also included the effect of weather on the 
probability of mortality following an overdose event. The 
hypothesis is that, due to British Columbia’s temperate 
oceanic climate in the densely populated parts of the 
province where most overdoses take place, cold or 
precipitation, or both, could lead to people using opioids 
in more isolated settings, reducing the possibility of 
assistance in the event of an overdose. A logistic impact 
on the mortality was considered for both temperature 
and precipitation.
Figure 1: Model overview
Flow of people who use drugs through different states (left). A certain proportion of people who use drugs 
relapsing or in contact with fentanyl supply will overdose, which is influenced by the fentanyl in supply. A certain 
percentage of overdoses will turn into overdose-related deaths, which is influenced (represented by a dashed 
line) by the take-home naloxone kits and the weather. Of those overdose-related deaths, a proportion will be 
fentanyl-related deaths, which are also influenced by the fentanyl in supply.

All parameters for the model were given prior 
probability distributions based either on literature 
estimates or expert opinion (see appendix for a full 
description). These distributions thus allowed us to 
incorporate prior information available from previous 
work, either as a point estimate with a measure of its SE 
or as a range of plausible values. The model fitting also 
incorporated comprehensive data on ambulance-linked 
overdoses, coroner-confirmed deaths due to fentanyl, 
coroner-confirmed deaths due to non-fentanyl drug-
overdose, and on the supply of THN kits in the 
population.
Calibration and validation of the model
This analysis used a Bayesian inference approach, which 
allows expert opinion and previous estimates of the 
parameters to inform the model calibration and produces 
a final model fit with error that includes both parameter 
and model uncertainty and is therefore of greater fidelity 
than using single point estimates.22–24 The fitted model 
was then validated through a cross-validation scheme, 
where each of the four data sources were left out of the 
model-fitting process in turn, and the various predicted 
values were then compared with the original data source 
that had been removed. Validation accuracy was assessed 
through the percentage overlap of the datapoints with the 
95% predictive interval for each of the data sources.
Counterfactual scenarios
After full model calibration we did several counterfactual 
studies, focusing on the period Jan 1 to Oct 31, 2016. We 
examined what would have happened if there had been 
different numbers of THN kits distributed, fewer at-risk 
people in the population, or changes to the supply of 
fentanyl over that period. We were thus able to assess the 
entire impact of the THN programme up to Oct 31, 2016, 
by comparing with a scenario where the programme did 
not exist. We also considered scenarios where the 
population of at-risk people who use drugs was halved; 
where all the kits distributed in 2016 were instead 
distributed at the start of 2016; where the kits were 
distributed at the start of 2016 and the at-risk population 
was reduced by a half; and where the proportion of 
fentanyl in the supply was the same as in 2015. All 
scenarios were compared with the scenario where no 
THN kits were distributed.
The statistic used to compare between scenarios was 
the estimated number of deaths averted. This number 
was calculated by firstly drawing a sample set of 
parameters from the posterior. For each parameter 
sample, a model simulation was done with the 
intervention and without the intervention or THN kits 
distributed (baseline). The cumulative difference between 
each scenario and the baseline (no THN programme) was 
then summed from Jan 1 to Oct 31, 2016, to determine the 
number of deaths averted. This calculation was repeated 
10 000 times and the median and 95 percentiles were 
taken to produce the estimated deaths averted with 
credible intervals (CrIs) in each scenario.
Role of the funding source
The funders (British Columbia Centre for Disease 
Control and the Canadian Institutes of Health Research) 
had no role in the study design, collection, analysis, or 
interpretation of the data, writing of the report, and no 
responsibility in the decision to publish. MAI, MG, and 
DC had full access to all data used in this study and the 
corresponding author had final responsibility to submit 
for publication.
Results
22 499 ambulance-attended overdoses and 2121 illicit 
drug-related deaths (677 [32%] deaths related to fentanyl) 
were recorded in the study period between Jan 1, 2012, 
and Oct 31, 2016. The number of fentanyl-related 
overdose deaths in British Columbia steadily increased 
from 2012 until 2015, reaching 11–16 deaths per month 
by the end of 2015 (figure 2). This increase was followed 
by a large spike in cases in the first months of 2016, 
reaching a peak of 47 deaths in March, followed by a 
general decline, although with high month-to-month 
variation (range 37–47 per month; figure 2A).
By comparison, all drug-related overdose deaths 
(including fentanyl) also increased until 2016, reaching 
a maximum in January with 84 deaths per month 
(4·7 times the pre-2012 median; figure 2A). There was a 
steady increase from 20 deaths in January, 2012, to 
67 deaths in December, 2015, with a higher rate in 2016 
(with overdose deaths attributable to fentanyl rising 
from 0% in January, 2012, to a maximum of 77% in May, 
2016). Ambulance-related overdoses also followed the 
general pattern of drug-related and fentanyl-related 
deaths, climbing from 256 overdose reports in January, 
2012, to 484 reports in November, 2015, with a large 
increase in 2016 (range 597–720, January, 2016, to 
October 2016; figure 2B). The THN programme 
underwent massive scale-up in 2016, with 13 757 (80·3%) 
kits being distributed from Jan 1 to Oct 31, 2016 
(figure 2C); in total, 19 074 THN kits were distributed 
during the study period.
When overdose data were removed from the fit, the 
accuracy of the fit dropped from 94·8% to 55·2%, with 
much of the error occurring during 2016 when overdose 
and death rates jumped substantially (appendix p 12). 
When drug-related death data were removed from the 
fit, we found a validation accuracy of 69·0%. Although 
the drug-related deaths were underestimated in the 
validation step where illicit drug deaths were removed 
from model fitting, throughout the course of the 
epidemic, there was overlap between the validation fit 
and the actual fit (appendix p 12). Because the proportion 
of fentanyl in the opioid supply drove the overdose and 
related deaths, removing the fentanyl-related deaths 
decreased accuracy from 94·8% to 15·5% (appendix p 12).

Removing the number of THN kits returned changed 
accuracy from 82·8% test accuracy to 48·3% validation 
accuracy. This change was due to the large uncertainty in 
the effectiveness of THN, which was strongly informed 
by the number of kits returned in the full fits. Overall, 
our model behaved rationally in this leave-one-out 
validation process, giving us good confidence in our full-
fit results.
After fitting and validatioFn (appendix pp 5–13), our 
model estimated that the prevalence of individuals 
coming into contact with a high proportion of fentanyl 
essentially doubled from 2015 to early 2016 (an increase 
of 2·3 times [95% CrI 2·0–2·9]). We compared the 
marginal posterior estimates of model parameters with 
the prior estimates. Those that showed a significant 
difference between the posterior and the prior were 
the overall THN kit probability of effective use 
(posterior estimate 85% [95% CrI 73–97] vs prior estimate 
50% [3–98]) and the fentanyl-related overdose rate 
(0·09 overdoses per person-month [95% CrI 0·09–0·10] 
vs 0·62 overdoses per person-month [0·37–1·04]). The 
model fitted parameters indicate an approximately ten-
fold increase (10·0 [95% CrI 9·7–10·7]) in the rate of 
fentanyl overdose compared with the background opioid 
level (0·0091 overdoses per person-month [95% CrI 
0·0089–0·0093]). Other parameters, including the size 
of the population at risk, showed some degree of change 
in the posterior estimates; however, these were not 
significant when compared with the prior estimates. The 
log-baseline death rate also showed a large degree of 
change, but this overlapped with the prior estimates, 
due to the uncertainty in this parameter in the prior 
estimates.
Overdoses, fentanyl-related deaths, and drug-related 
deaths were all well fitted by the model, with 94·8%, 
94·8%, and 98·3% of the dataset falling within the 
95% predictive interval for each observable, respectively 
(appendix p 14). The number of kits returned did slightly 
worse, with only 82·8% falling within the predictive 
interval. This result might be due to secondary effects of 
the THN programme such as greater awareness in the 
population meaning more kits would be used than 
expected. The goodness of fit indicated the rise in 
overdose deaths was explainable due to the increase in 
risk of contact with fentanyl.
The impact of weather on the rate of mortality following 
overdose was marginally significant. The mortality rate 
varied between 10·4% and 9·1% between winter and 
summer, with a proportional increase of 14%. Temperature 
was the dominant impact on weather-dependent mortality, 
with an effect size 4·2 (95% CrI 1·7–10·5) times greater 
than the effect of precipitation (appendix p 15).

Model fitting was also done without the inclusion of 
the THN programme data. Although the observed deaths 
and overdoses could be explained by a monthly change 
in overdose rate alone, the number of THN kits 
administered was only explained with the inclusion of 
THN kits distributed into the model (appendix p 19).
Comparing the scenario where no kits were distributed 
with the full model fit, we estimated the total number of 
deaths averted due to the THN programme since 2012 to 
be 298 (95% CrI 91–474). Of those deaths averted, 
155 (95% CrI 54–268) were linked to fentanyl (figure 3B). 
The estimated number of deaths averted per month was 
relatively small (around two) for each year before 2016. 
However, this number increased to 11 in January, 2016, 
and from February to October, 2016, we estimated a mean 
number of deaths averted of 22 per month (range 14–35). 
The number of kits used per death averted between Jan 1, 
2012, and Oct 31, 2016, was 10·1 (95% CrI 5·6–34·6) and 
the number of kits distributed per death averted was 
64·7 (36·3–222·3).
The estimated number of deaths averted were compared 
for a number of retrospective scenarios from Jan 1 to 
Oct 31, 2016 (figure 4). We estimated that THN kits as 
distributed by the programme averted 226 deaths 
(95% CrI 125–340), with 85·2 kits (95% CrI 61·1–132·5) 
distributed per death averted. This estimate represents 
33% (95% CrI 19–45) of all deaths in that period. If the 
proportion of fentanyl in the drug supply was the same as 
in 2015, we estimated the number of deaths prevented 
would have been 310 (95% CrI 195–420; figure 4). Similar 
impacts were estimated in scenarios where the number of 
individuals at risk of a fentanyl-linked overdose was halved, 
and where all THN kits were distributed at the start of 2016 
(ie, Jan 1, 2016), with 344 deaths averted (95% CrI 267–425), 
representing an additional 118 deaths (95% CrI 64–207) 
averted and 51·4 kits (95% CrI 42·2–64·4) distributed 
per death averted. This estimate represents 53% 
(95% CrI 41–66) of all deaths in that period. Unsurprisingly, 
the scenario with the greatest impact was where both the 
at-risk population was halved and the THN kits 
were distributed at the start of 2016, with 720 deaths 
(95% CrI 650–790) averted between Jan 1 and Oct 31, 2016 
(figure 4). Reducing the at-risk population also had an 
impact on the rate of overdoses (total overdoses including 
those leading to death). Halving the at-risk population 
averted 3500 overdoses (95% CrI 3200–3900) between 
Jan 1 and Oct 31, 2016 (data not shown).
Discussion
Distribution of naloxone has been shown to be effective 
at reversing opioid overdoses.12,19 Until now, however, 
there has not been an estimate of deaths averted due to a 
mass naloxone distribution campaign during an opioid 
overdose epidemic. We fitted and analysed a Markov 
chain state model of overdoses and deaths occurring in 
the presence of a dynamically varying proportion of 
fentanyl in the general illicit drug supply.
We estimate that the British Columbia THN programme 
averted 226 deaths (95% CrI 125–340) from Jan 1 to Oct 31, 
2016. This estimate represents 33% (95% CrI 19–45) of the 
deaths that occurred over that time period. In comparison, 
if the programme had achieved scale-up earlier and all kits 
that were distributed in 2016 had been distributed by 
the beginning of the year, we estimate that 344 deaths 
(95% CrI 267–425) would have been averted. This estimate 
represents 53% (95% CrI 41–66) of all deaths over that time 
period. This is comparable to our estimates for scenarios 
where the fentanyl supply was at the same level each 
month as in 2015, or where the at-risk population is halved. 
We also find an additive effect of combining interventions 
on the number of deaths averted.
The model fit indicates a 10·0 times (95% CrI 9·7–10·7) 
increase in the rate of an overdose due to fentanyl

compared with the background overdose rate. The spike 
in overdoses and overdose-related death during 2016 is 
reflected in a doubling of the modelled probability of a 
person who uses drugs coming into contact with 
fentanyl in the general supply. Although weather and in 
particular temperature was also considered a factor in 
the increase in cases in late 2015 to early 2016, our 
analysis does not support a significant impact from this 
factor alone.25
Our findings suggest that an earlier scale-up of THN 
before the rapid increase in fentanyl would have had a 
pronounced impact on both deaths averted and the 
cost-effectiveness of the THN programme. 85·2 kits 
(95% CrI 61·1–132·5) distributed per death averted (ie, 
if kits were distributed between Jan 1 and Oct 31, 2016) 
compared with 51·4 kits (42·2–64·4) if they were 
distributed earlier (ie, refers to the counterfactual 
scenario where all kits distributed in 2016 were instead 
distributed on Jan 1, 2016). These figures show the need 
for a rapid response by authorities to avert more severe 
outcomes and might help inform decisions in other 
jurisdictions.
There is an urgent need for a multifaceted approach to 
the global opioid epidemic.2 To this end we studied the 
impact of reducing the overall at-risk population in 
combination with the distribution of naloxone. Reducing 
the population has the added benefit of also averting the 
number of overdoses by 3500 (95% CrI 3200–3900), 
whereas there might be a limited impact on the number 
of overdoses reduced with THN since a kit is only 
administered once an overdose has occurred. Multiple 
interventions can contribute towards the reduction of the 
at-risk population, including the use of opioid 
substitution therapy.26 As shown, these would likely have 
a large impact on the number of overdoses. In future 
work we intend to more explicitly model multiple 
interventions in the ongoing fentanyl epidemic and their 
associated costs, to better understand the long-term 
impacts in the ongoing crisis.
Our study had limitations. Fentanyl is assumed to 
affect the rate of overdoses alone and not the probability 
of death following an overdose. Fentanyl contact rate 
was modelled as a latent time series. If more regular 
sampling of the general illicit drug supply occurred 
then this could be included in the estimation. A linear 
relationship is assumed between the THN effectiveness 
and the number of kits that are distributed. Although 
certain risk behaviours might have changed over 
time this was not explicitly modelled, but instead 
incorporated into the overdose rate as a latent time 
series (see appendix pp 17–21 for exploratory and 
sensitivity anlyses of these limitations). The model 
was constructed in the context of an increasing 
concentration of fentanyl adulterant in the general drug 
supply, so other factors might need to be considered in 
other jurisdictions where the population of people who 
use drugs is also changing. Non-fentanyl-related deaths 
were assumed to occur at a constant rate. This 
assumption was justified as non-fentanyl-related deaths 
did not change substantially in the study period. We 
assumed that the number of people compliant with 
opioid substitution therapy was constant and that this 
group was not at risk of overdose; however, the actual 
number of patients increased modestly during this 
period and this group certainly has a risk of overdose 
(see appendix p 17 for a sensitivity analysis of the at-risk 
population).27
Our findings suggest that THN was effective at 
mitigating the number of overdose-linked deaths in the 
context of a dramatic increase in the use of fentanyl. Our 
model analysis suggests that, based on our findings 
specific to British Columbia, distribution of naloxone 
and other resources should be mobilised as early as 
possible when there has been an increase in fentanyl-
linked deaths. Combination of THN with treatment and 
other harm-reduction strategies could have an additive 
impact on the number of deaths averted and might 
further reduce the number of overdoses and associated 
demands on the health-care system.

The scenarios were: the actual number of take-home naloxone kits that were distributed (baseline); the rate of 
fentanyl in the supply was the same as in 2015; all the kits distributed in 2016 were instead distributed on Jan 1, 
2016; the population of people who use drugs was halved; and the kits were distributed on Jan 1, 2016, and the 
at-risk population was reduced by a half. Middle line is the median, shaded area is the 50% credible interval, 
whiskers show the 95% credible interval, and diamonds show the 5% outliers.
