OBJECTIVES: The American Academy of Pediatrics recommends infant-parent room-sharing 
until age 1. We assessed the association between room-sharing and sleep outcomes.
METHODS: The Intervention Nurses Start Infants Growing on Healthy Trajectories study is 
an obesity prevention trial comparing a responsive parenting intervention with a safety 
control among primiparous mother-infant dyads. Mothers completed the Brief Infant Sleep 
Questionnaire at 4, 9, 12, and 30 months. Reported sleep duration and overnight behaviors, 
adjusted for intervention group, were compared among early independent sleepers (own 
room <4 months), later independent sleepers (own room between 4 and 9 months), and 
room-sharers at 9 months.
RESULTS: At 4 months, reported overnight sleep duration was similar between groups, but 
compared with room-sharers, early independent sleepers had better sleep consolidation 
(longest stretch: 46 more minutes, P = .02). At 9 months, early independent sleepers slept 
40 more minutes nightly than room-sharers and 26 more minutes than later independent 
sleepers (P = .008). The longest stretch for early independent sleepers was 100 and  
45 minutes more than room-sharers and later independent sleepers, respectively (P = .01). 
At 30 months, infants sleeping independently by 9 months slept >45 more minutes nightly 
than those room-sharing at 9 months (P = .004). Room-sharers had 4 times the odds of 
transitioning to bed-sharing overnight at both 4 and 9 months (P < .01 for both).
CONCLUSIONS: Room-sharing at ages 4 and 9 months is associated with less nighttime sleep 
in both the short and long-term, reduced sleep consolidation, and unsafe sleep practices 
previously associated with sleep-related death.

The importance of getting an 
adequate night’s sleep has been 
increasingly recognized by 
professional societies including the 
American Academy of Pediatrics1 
(AAP) and the American Academy of 
Sleep Medicine.2 Inadequate sleep 
has been associated with poorer 
cognitive, psychomotor, physical, 
and socioemotional development, 
which includes emotion regulation, 
mood, and behavior in infancy and 
childhood.3 
– 
6 Insufficient sleep is 
generally accepted as an important 
risk factor for obesity, 
7, 
 
8 with links 
between sleep and weight beginning 
in infancy.9 
– 
14 Short sleep duration 
during infancy is also associated with 
inadequate sleep later in childhood, 
15 
 
emphasizing the importance of 
developing healthy sleep-related 
behaviors during the first months 
after birth. Also, infant sleep has 
a bidirectional relationship with 
parent outcomes as demonstrated 
by associations between infant 
sleep and parental sleep, maternal 
sensitivity, relationship quality, 
parental emotional health, and 
parenting practices.16 
– 
18
The desire to optimize infant 
sleep duration and consolidation, 
however, must be balanced with 
safe infant sleep, a fact reinforced 
by the 3500 infants who tragically 
die of sudden infant death syndrome 
(SIDS) or other sleep-related 
deaths annually.19 According to the 
Eunice Kennedy Shriver National 
Institute of Child Health and Human 
Development’s “Safe to Sleep” 
campaign, most SIDS deaths occur 
when infants are 1 to 4 months old, 
90% occurring before the age of 
6 months.20 Despite these figures, 
the recently published AAP Policy 
Statement, SIDS and Other Sleep-
Related Infant Deaths, recommended 
that infants sleep in their parents’ 
room on a separate surface, ideally 
for the entire first year but at least 
for the first 6 months.21 The 1-year 
recommendation has questionable 
congruence with the epidemiology 
of SIDS (as risk is far lower after 
6 months), and it runs counter to 
the common clinical advice parents 
receive. Based on evidence of 
improved infant sleep, 
22– 
24 clinicians 
may encourage parents to establish 
independent sleep environments  
(ie, in a separate room from parents) 
during the middle of the first year 
to promote healthy and sustainable 
sleep patterns before the typical 
onset of separation anxiety later in 
the first year.25 Therefore, in this 
secondary data analysis, we sought 
to evaluate the associations between 
room-sharing on a separate sleep 
surface and sleep-related outcomes 
from the cohort participating in the 
Intervention Nurses Start Infants 
Growing on Healthy Trajectories 
(INSIGHT) study. We hypothesized 
that room-sharing would be 
associated with shorter nighttime 
sleep duration and problematic 
sleep-related behaviors during 
infancy when compared with 
independent sleeping in a separate 
room. We also sought to examine 
risk factors for SIDS among infants 
who were and were not independent 
sleepers.
MeThODs
Participants and Design
As previously described, 
26 
– 
28 
mothers and their newborns were 
recruited after delivery from 
one maternity ward (Penn State 
Milton S. Hershey Medical Center, 
Hershey, PA) for participation in the 
INSIGHT study from January 2012 
to March 2014. The study design 
and inclusion and exclusion criteria 
have been previously published.26 
Major eligibility criteria specified 
that the subjects be term singletons 
weighing ≥2500 g delivered to 
English-speaking, primiparous 
mothers ≥20 years old. Dyads were 
randomly assigned 2 weeks after 
delivery to a responsive parenting 
(RP) intervention or a safety control 
group. 279 mother-infant dyads 
completed the first home visit and 
are considered the study cohort for 
outcomes as specified before study 
initiation in the protocol. For the 
current analyses, those parents who 
reported bed-sharing with their 
newborn were excluded because the 
goal was to compare those who were 
sleeping independently in a separate 
room from parents with those still 
room-sharing but not bed-sharing  
(as recommended by the AAP).
Research nurses conducted 
home visits at infant ages of 3 to 
4 weeks and 4, 6, and 9 months. 
Research center visits occurred at 
1 and 2 years of age. Intervention 
components have been previously 
described.27 Among other sleep-
related topics discussed at the 3- to 
4-week home visit, the RP group 
received guidance encouraging 
parents to consider moving their 
child’s sleep location at the age of 
3 months to the room they would 
prefer the infant to sleep in at 1 year 
of age, with the advice that such a 
move would be more difficult if the 
family waited much beyond that 
point.25 This point was reinforced at 
the 4-month home visit. The safety 
control group received education 
regarding prevention of SIDS, which 
included direct observation of the 
sleep environment by the visiting 
nurses with individual feedback to 
improve safety at the first 3 home 
visits. This study was approved by 
the Penn State College of Medicine’s 
Human Subjects Protection Office and 
registered at www. 
clinicaltrials. 
gov.
Measures
Data were collected and managed 
by using REDCap (Vanderbilt 
University, Nashville, TN).29 
Mothers completed the online 
surveys with paper surveys mailed to 
those lacking internet connectivity 
(n = 20). A detailed list of measures 
was published.26

Background Characteristics
Demographic information collected 
at enrollment included parent 
and child race/ethnicity, maternal 
education, annual income, and 
marital status. Data extracted from 
medical charts included maternal 
age, prepregnancy weight, gestational 
weight gain, infant gestational age, 
and birth anthropometrics.
Sleep
The validated Brief Infant Sleep 
Questionnaire was used to assess 
sleep at 4 and 9 months of age with 
an abbreviated version administered 
at 12 and 30 months.30 This survey 
assesses infant sleep location, 
before-bedtime activities, and sleep 
patterns. Sleep duration is divided 
into nighttime (7 pm–7 am) and 
daytime (7 am–7 pm) and is reported 
in hours and minutes. Additional 
questions regarding sleep location, 
night waking, night feedings, 
bedtime routine components and 
duration, infant sleep behaviors 
and environment, and parenting 
responses to night wakings were 
asked at 4 and 9 months. Instructions 
for the infant sleep survey guided 
mothers to think about her child’s 
sleep during the past week when 
answering the questions and base 
responses on a “typical night.” 
Maternal sleep quality was measured 
at 4 months of infant age by using 
the PROMIS Sleep Disturbance 
instrument (PROMIS Network, 
American Institutes for Research, 
Chapel Hill, NC).31
Other
Feeding mode was assessed by using 
a food frequency questionnaire. 
Infants were categorized as 
predominantly breastfed if ≥80% of 
milk feedings were breastmilk.32
statistical analysis
Data were analyzed by using SAS 
version 9.4 (SAS Institute, Cary, NC). 
Descriptive statistics were generated 
for sleep duration and behaviors 
on the basis of the timing of our 2 
sleep assessments during infancy 
at 4 and 9 months of age, which 
created 3 groups: early independent 
sleepers (own room <4 months), 
later independent sleepers (own 
room between 4 and 9 months), 
and room-sharers at 9 months. For 
continuous outcomes, differences 
by sleep location were assessed by 
using analysis of variance (ANOVA) 
at each of the 4 times, adjusting for 
study group assignment. Categorical 
outcomes were assessed by using 
logistic regression, adjusting for 
study group. Analyses including 
socioeconomic covariates (eg, 
income, living in a single-family 
home) did not result in major 
differences in results, and thus 
results from models that included 
only study group are presented. 
Statistical significance was defined as 
P ≤ .05.
ResulTs
Among 279 participants, 
27, 
 
28 259 
(93%) remained in the study 
through 9 months of age. Among 
this group, 20 were bed-sharing 
at 4 and/or 9 months and 9 had 
missing data on sleep. These 
participants were excluded from 
further analyses, leaving a sample 
of 230 mother-infant pairs as the 
sample for this manuscript. The 
majority of infants, 142 (62%), 
were “early independent sleepers, 
”  
sleeping independently without 
room-sharing by 4 months (Table 1).  
Another 62 (27%) were “later 
independent sleepers” who began 
sleeping independently between 4 
and 9 months of age, whereas  
26 (11%) were room-sharing at  
9 months. There were no differences 
between intervention groups in 
terms of frequency of bed-sharing 
or room-sharing at 4 or 9 months. 
Room-sharing was associated with 
demographic variables including 
race/ethnicity, lower income and 
education, unmarried and/or not 
cohabiting with partner, fewer 
bedrooms in the home, and 
extended family and/or other 
people living in the home.
Reported sleep Duration, 
consolidation, night Wakings, and 
night Feedings
At 4 months, no significant 
differences in nighttime or total 
sleep duration were observed 
between those who were early 
independent sleepers and those 
who room-shared at 4 and/or  
9 months (Fig 1). However, the early 
independent sleepers had better 
sleep consolidation at 4 months 
of age with a longest (mean ± SD) 
sleep stretch averaging 469 ±  
139 minutes compared with 423 ± 
158 minutes for those who were 
room-sharing (Table 2) (P = .02). 
While the mean number of night 
wakings was similar between early 
independent and nonindependent 
sleeping infants at 4 months of age, 
those sleeping independently had 
fewer night feedings (1.1 vs 1.4;  
P = .02). Nonindependent sleepers 
also had twice the odds of being fed 
back to sleep overnight compared 
with independent sleepers (adjusted 
odds ratio [aOR] 1.95, 95% confidence 
interval [CI] 1.09–3.50).
By 9 months of age, significant 
differences in nighttime sleep 
duration emerged between groups 
(Table 3). The early independent 
sleepers slept on average 627 ± 
67 minutes per night compared 
with 601 ± 73 minutes for later 
independent sleepers and 587 ± 
83 minutes for those who were 
room-sharing at 9 months of age 
(P = .008). Those who were early 
independent sleepers had the best 
sleep consolidation with the longest 
sleep stretches, averaging 542 ±  
162 minutes versus 497 ± 166 minutes 
for later independent sleepers and 
442 ± 158 minutes for room-sharers 
(P = .01). Although night wakings, 
night feedings, and odds of being 
fed back to sleep overnight did not

differ among groups at 9 months of 
age, total daily sleep duration was 
longest among early independent 
sleepers (796 ± 86 vs 760 ± 94 vs 
773 ± 96 minutes, P = .04).
At 12 months of age, no differences 
existed between groups for 
nighttime or total daily sleep 
duration. However, the 30-month 
assessment revealed that both early 
and later independent sleepers slept 
on average more than 45 minutes 
longer at night than those who were 
room-sharing at 9 months (614 ± 51 
vs 617 ± 70 vs 569 ± 79; P = .004). 
Total daily sleep duration was  
similar among groups at 30 months 
of age.
bedtime Routines
Significant differences existed for 
bedtime routines at 4 months of age. 
Early independent sleepers had 
increased odds of having a consistent 
bedtime routine (aOR 1.93, 95% CI 
1.05–3.53) and being put to bed by 
8 pm (aOR 1.93, 95% CI 1.06–3.53) 
relative to room-sharers. At 9 months 
of age, room-sharing was associated 
with greater odds of having a bedtime

lower odds than independent 
sleepers of being put to sleep drowsy 
but awake (P ≤ .05 for both).
sleep safety
At 4 months of age, room-sharing 
infants had greater odds of having 
an unapproved object (blankets, 
pillows, positioners, etc) on their 
sleep surface than those who were 
sleeping independently (aOR 2.04, 
95% CI 1.17–3.57). Additionally, 
room-sharing parents with infants 
at 4 months of age had over 4 times 
the odds of bringing their infant 
into their bed overnight than 
those parenting early independent 
sleepers (aOR 4.24, 95% CI  
1.64–10.95). Similarly, at 9 months 
of age, room-sharing parents had 
4 times the odds than those who

DIscussIOn
These secondary analyses from the 
INSIGHT study demonstrate that 
infant-parent room-sharing at 4 and 
9 months of age is associated with 
less reported nighttime sleep in both 
the short- and long-term, worse 
sleep consolidation, and unsafe sleep 
practices previously associated with 
sleep-related death. The findings 
raise questions about the well-
intended AAP recommendation that 
room-sharing should ideally occur for 
all infants until their first birthday.21
The recommendation to room-share 
until the age of 1 year is not evidence-
based for the prevention of SIDS, given 
that 90% of these tragedies occur 
before the age of 6 months.20 The 
data presented by the AAP Task Force 
on Sudden Infant Death Syndrome 
to support the recommendation21 
came from 3 European case-control 
reports.33 
–35 In the first by Blair et al, 
33  
infants who died of SIDS at over  
4 months of age were more likely than 
controls to be room-sharing without 
bed-sharing (46% vs 41%) and less 
likely to be sleeping independently 
in their own rooms (43% vs 53%; 
statistical comparison not performed), 
yet the age stratification presented 
in this paper was not acknowledged 
in a recently published letter by the 
Task Force.36 The second report 
involved mostly infants <6 months 
old and used data from the early- to 
mid-1990s, when prone sleeping 
was still common.34 The third study 
involved only 123 cases of SIDS with 
a mean age of 13.6 ± 9.5 weeks, 
indicating that most cases included 
infants <6 months old.35 This small 
study included only 15 infants who 
slept in their own room and died of 
SIDS. Therefore, it is unlikely that any 
conclusions can be made about those 
who were 6 to 12 months old on the 
basis of this small sample size and 
the epidemiology of the condition. 
Importantly, the biggest risk factor for 
SIDS in this third report was “sharing 
the same sleep surface as the last 
sleep location, 
” something that more 
commonly occurred among infants 
who initially shared their mother’s 
room in our study.
In addition to the lack of data 
supporting the recommendation 
to room-share until 1 year of age, 
the Policy Statement authored by 
the Task Force did not describe a 
mechanism by which room-sharing 
would prevent SIDS or how parents 
should apply this recommendation 
to achieve better outcomes than 
those parents choosing to have 
their infants sleep independently. 
Although the Task Force’s recent 
letter cited more frequent arousals 
among room-sharers as the potential 
protective mechanism, 
36 the 2 studies  
referenced do not support that 
conclusion. The first is a case-control 
study of 18 infants.37 Among 9 room-
sharers, 5 were bed-sharers, making 
conclusions about arousals among 
those who are room-sharing but not 
bed-sharing (versus independent 
sleepers) problematic. The second 
study, which also included bed-
sharers in the room-sharing group, 
states that parental presence in 
the room at bedtime (eg, holding, 
rocking, feeding to sleep) explained 
much of the variance in night 
wakings and that night-long room-
sharing had a “negligible (<1%) 
independent contribution to the 
explained variance.” 
22
The AAP recommendation to room-
share until the age of 1 year conflicts 
with sleep expert guidance, 
25 which 
recognizes developmental changes 
that occur over the first year. The 
suggestion that parents wait to move 
the infant out of their bedroom 
until the end of the first year, when 
separation anxiety is normative 
and increasing, is likely to result 
in frustrated parents and unhappy 
infants. It also conflicts with other data 
that room-sharing is associated with 
more sleep disruption for mothers.24, 
 
38
Our data showing shorter night 
sleep and shorter sleep bouts for 
infants who are room-sharing has 
potentially important consequences. 
Inadequate sleep affects nearly every 
health domain, including emotional 
regulation, mood, and behavior 
in infancy and childhood.3 
– 
6 As 
demonstrated in our analyses, room-
sharing and short sleep duration 
during infancy are also associated 
with inadequate sleep later in 
childhood, 
15 which emphasizes the 
importance of developing healthy 
sleep-related behaviors during the 
first months of life. Infant sleep also 
affects parental sleep, which can 
affect other outcomes, including 
maternal sensitivity, relationship 
quality, parental emotional health, 
and parenting practices.16, 
 
17 Fatigue is 
related to somatic complaints, anxiety, 
depression, paranoia, and crashes or 
unintentional injuries involving motor 
vehicles among healthy adults39, 
 
40 and 
has been associated with postpartum 
depression, 
41 abusive head trauma, 
and child abuse.42 At a time when 
family-centered guidance is strongly 
encouraged, parent fatigue should be 
considered in any guideline related to 
infant sleep.
Perhaps our most troubling finding 
was that room-sharing was associated 
with overnight transitions to bed-
sharing, which is strongly discouraged 
by the AAP.21 Bed-sharing overnight 
was more common in our sample 
among 4- and 9-month-olds who 
began the night on a separate surface 
in their parents’ room. This finding is 
consistent with those from another 
recently described cohort.43
There are limitations to our analyses. 
The data come from a randomized 
controlled trial with 2 interventions. 
The control group received 
information aimed at reducing the risk 
of SIDS, although no recommendation 
was made regarding sleep location. 
The RP intervention included 
guidance to improve sleep duration 
and sleep-related behaviors, including 
recommending independent infant 
sleep by 4 months of age. However, 
sleep location did not vary significantly 
by intervention group (data not 
shown), and all analyses were adjusted

for study group. Next, the findings 
we report are correlational, and 
causal effects cannot be inferred. It is 
possible that parents of infants with 
poorer sleep prefer that infants sleep 
more closely to them. The relatively 
homogeneous INSIGHT sample is 
another potential limitation, as are the 
self-reported data, although the Brief 
Infant Sleep Questionnaire has been 
validated against objective measures 
of sleep.30 Some previous studies 
have shown discrepancies between 
subjective and objective measures of 
sleep, 
24, 
 
38 and the lack of an objective 
measure may have resulted in 
unreported night wakings in which 
the infant self-soothed back to sleep. 
This possibility would particularly 
influence the sleep consolidation data, 
especially for independent sleepers. 
However, this possibility, if true, 
would only reinforce the concept that 
room-sharing may result in either 
unnecessary parental responses to 
infant night wakings or, alternatively, 
the infant’s expectation of caretaking 
behaviors from parents, both of 
which can be expected to lead to 
decreased sleep for infant and parent. 
In addition, parental perceptions of 
their infant’s sleep are the basis for 
whether they report sleep problems 
and request guidance from health care 
providers.
Our data showing that room-sharing 
families had lower education, income, 
and less likelihood of living in a single-
family residence emphasize that not all 
parents have a choice regarding their 
infant’s sleep location and may not 
have the option to have the infant sleep 
independently, a factor we could not 
fully address although demographics 
and home characteristics were 
assessed in data analyses. Cultural 
norms may also lead to preferences 
for room-sharing in some patient 
populations, as described by Mileva-
Seitz et al.44 Lastly, we did not assess 
room-sharing beyond 9 months of age.
cOnclusIOns
While substantial progress has been 
made over the past several decades 
to improve the safety of infant sleep, 
the AAP recommendation that parents 
room-share with their infants until the 
age of 1 year is not supported by data, 
is inconsistent with the epidemiology 
of SIDS, is incongruent with our 
understanding of socioemotional 
development in the second half of the 
first year, and has the potential for 
unintended consequences for infants 
and families. Our findings showing 
poorer sleep-related outcomes and 
more unsafe sleep practices among 
dyads who room-share beyond 
early infancy suggest that the AAP 
should reconsider and revise the 
recommendation pending evidence to 
support room-sharing through the age 
of 1 year.
