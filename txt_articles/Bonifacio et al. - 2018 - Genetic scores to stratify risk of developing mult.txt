Abstract
Background
Around 0.3% of newborns will develop autoimmunity to pancreatic beta cells in childhood
and subsequently develop type 1 diabetes before adulthood. Primary prevention of type 1
diabetes will require early intervention in genetically at-risk infants. The objective of this
study was to determine to what extent genetic scores (two previous genetic scores and a
merged genetic score) can improve the prediction of type 1 diabetes.
Methods and findings
The Environmental Determinants of Diabetes in the Young (TEDDY) study followed geneti-
cally at-risk children at 3- to 6-monthly intervals from birth for the development of islet auto-
antibodies and type 1 diabetes. Infants were enrolled between 1 September 2004 and 28
February 2010 and monitored until 31 May 2016. The risk (positive predictive value) for

 developing multiple islet autoantibodies (pre-symptomatic type 1 diabetes) and type 1 dia-
betes was determined in 4,543 children who had no first-degree relatives with type 1 diabe-
tes and either a heterozygous HLA DR3 and DR4-DQ8 risk genotype or a homozygous
DR4-DQ8 genotype, and in 3,498 of these children in whom genetic scores were calculated
from 41 single nucleotide polymorphisms. In the children with the HLA risk genotypes, risk
for developing multiple islet autoantibodies was 5.8% (95% CI 5.0%–6.6%) by age 6 years,
and risk for diabetes by age 10 years was 3.7% (95% CI 3.0%–4.4%). Risk for developing
multiple islet autoantibodies was 11.0% (95% CI 8.7%–13.3%) in children with a merged
genetic score of >14.4 (upper quartile; n = 907) compared to 4.1% (95% CI 3.3%–4.9%, P <
0.001) in children with a genetic score of �14.4 (n = 2,591). Risk for developing diabetes by
age 10 years was 7.6% (95% CI 5.3%–9.9%) in children with a merged score of >14.4 com-
pared with 2.7% (95% CI 1.9%–3.6%) in children with a score of �14.4 (P < 0.001). Of 173
children with multiple islet autoantibodies by age 6 years and 107 children with diabetes
by age 10 years, 82 (sensitivity, 47.4%; 95% CI 40.1%–54.8%) and 52 (sensitivity, 48.6%,
95% CI 39.3%–60.0%), respectively, had a score >14.4. Scores were higher in European
versus US children (P = 0.003). In children with a merged score of >14.4, risk for multiple
islet autoantibodies was similar and consistently >10% in Europe and in the US; risk
was greater in males than in females (P = 0.01). Limitations of the study include that the
genetic scores were originally developed from case–control studies of clinical diabetes in
individuals of mainly European decent. It is, therefore, possible that it may not be suitable to
all populations.
Conclusions
A type 1 diabetes genetic score identified infants without family history of type 1 diabetes
who had a greater than 10% risk for pre-symptomatic type 1 diabetes, and a nearly 2-fold
higher risk than children identified by high-risk HLA genotypes alone. This finding extends
the possibilities for enrolling children into type 1 diabetes primary prevention trials.
Author summary
Why was this study done?
• Prevention of childhood diseases such as type 1 diabetes is of medical importance.
• Prevention of type 1 diabetes might be best achieved by intervention prior to the devel-
opment of islet autoantibodies, which define a pre-symptomatic disease stage.
• Early intervention requires tools such as measures of genetic risk that identify future
cases.
• Risk for type 1 diabetes in the absence of a family history is currently identified by HLA
genotyping, with maximum identified risk reaching around 5%.
• Genetic scores derived from multiple risk loci may improve risk stratification for pre-
symptomatic type 1 diabetes.

 What did the researchers do and find?
• Two previously proposed genetic scores for type 1 diabetes risk were calculated for over
3,000 children without a family history of type 1 diabetes but with 1 of the 2 highest-risk
HLA genotypes (heterozygous DR3 and DR4-DQ8 or homozygous DR4-DQ8) partici-
pating in the TEDDY cohort study, which prospectively follows children from birth for
the development of islet autoantibodies and diabetes.
• We found that both of the genetic scores, and a merged genetic score that combined the
features of both, stratified the risk for islet autoantibodies and diabetes in the children.
• The upper quartile of the merged genetic score was associated with a >10% risk for the
pre-symptomatic stage of multiple islet autoantibodies, and almost half the children
who developed pre-symptomatic or symptomatic diabetes were identified by this score.
What do these findings mean?
• Combining genetic information from multiple risk loci can improve the prediction of
diseases such as type 1 diabetes.
• A genetic risk score model is proposed that could be used to recruit infants into early
type 1 diabetes primary prevention trials.
• The model provides a new paradigm for genetic screening and selection of at-risk
infants that, together with family history and HLA genotyping, could identify up to 25%
of future childhood cases of type 1 diabetes from less than 1% of newborns.
Introduction
Precision medicine typically relies on our ability to identify individuals with precise genetic
elements that define a disease. These elements may be used not only to select optimal treat-
ment modalities, but also to identify individuals who may benefit from preventative interven-
tions. In pediatric disease, current studies seeking to elucidate disease etiology, as well as
clinical trials aimed at prevention, rely on identifying and enrolling infants with increased risk
[1–7]. The risk for diseases such as allergy, type 1 diabetes, and celiac disease is often assessed
in terms of family history [1–3,7], which, at best, identifies 10% of children who subsequently
develop the condition [7,8].
In type 1 diabetes, genotypes in the human leukocyte antigen (HLA) DRB1, DQA1, and
DQB1 loci are sometimes used to identify at-risk infants from the general population [2,9,10].
Risk is 5% in children with the 2 highest-risk HLA genotypes (DR3 and DR4-DQ8 or homozy-
gous for DR4-DQ8), and 40% of cases of childhood type 1 diabetes have 1 of these 2 genotypes
[11]. Although the HLA loci are the strongest genetic risk markers for type 1 diabetes, many
other regions of the genome also confer susceptibility to type 1 diabetes [12]. Therefore, it is
conceivable that risk stratification could be improved if risk is calculated according to genetic
information derived from multiple genetic susceptibility regions [13,14].
We previously applied logistic regression to the Type 1 Diabetes Genetics Consortium
(T1DGC) case–control dataset and developed a weighted genetic score derived from HLA
and 40 type 1 diabetes susceptibility loci (Winkler score) [15]. Independently, a genetic score

 derived from HLA plus 25 susceptibility loci was developed in the UK using Wellcome Trust
Case Control Consortium (WTCCC) data (Oram score) [16]. These studies suggested that
the scores might improve our ability to predict and diagnose type 1 diabetes. Hence, genetic
scores could become a new paradigm for stratifying type 1 diabetes risk and for recruitment
into primary prevention trials, and provide a proof of principle for other diseases with multiple
known genetic susceptibility markers. With this in mind, the 2 consortia joined efforts to
determine how the 2 genetic scores and a merged score performed in a prospective study.
The Environmental Determinants of Diabetes in the Young (TEDDY) study, a multicenter
cohort study set in Germany, Finland, Sweden, and the US, has intensively followed several
thousand HLA-selected children from birth for the development of islet autoantibodies and of
diabetes [17]. The presence of 2 or more islet autoantibodies (multiple islet autoantibodies) in
genetically at-risk children defines a pre-symptomatic stage of type 1 diabetes where progres-
sion to type 1 diabetes is around 80% over 10 years [18,19]. TEDDY offers the unique opportu-
nity to test the multiple-locus genetic scores in a prospectively studied cohort of children who
have high-risk HLA genotypes in the absence of family history of type 1 diabetes [2,17]. The
objective of our analysis was to determine whether the genetic scores could identify infants
from the general population who had at least a 10% risk for type 1 diabetes, a risk threshold
that has been used for primary prevention trials and that has previously only been achievable
in infants with a family history of type 1 diabetes [3].
Methods
Case–control cohort
We reasoned that our target risk of 10% could only be achieved by applying our multi-locus
genetic scores in individuals who had the highest-risk HLA genotypes. We obtained data for
controls from the UK Biobank (https://www.ukbiobank.ac.uk/) [20] and data for controls
and cases from the WTCCC [21], and calculated the Winkler and Oram scores in 4,371 non-
diabetic individuals who were heterozygous for HLA DR3-DQA1�0501-DQB1�0201 and
DR4-DQA1�030X-DQB1�0302 (HLA DR3/DR4-DQ8) or who were homozygous for HLA
DR4-DQA1�030X-DQB1�0302 (HLA DR4-DQ8/DR4-DQ8) (controls) and 781 patients with
type 1 diabetes who had 1 of these 2 genotypes (cases). UK Biobank participants were aged 40
to 69 years, and the WTCCC patients were all aged <50 years when sampled.
TEDDY cohort
TEDDY is a prospective cohort study conducted at 3 centers in the US (Colorado, Georgia/
Florida, and Washington) and 3 centers in Europe (Finland, Germany, and Sweden) [2,17].
Between 1 September 2004 and 28 February 2010, a total of 421,047 newborn children were
screened for high-risk HLA genotypes for type 1 diabetes [22]. HLA genotype screening was
conducted as previously described [22]. The families of children with type 1 diabetes risk HLA
genotypes were invited to participate in the follow-up study in which blood samples were
obtained every 3 months for the first 4 years and biannually thereafter for the analysis of islet
autoantibodies (glutamic acid decarboxylase antibody [GADA], insulinoma antigen-2 anti-
body [IA-2A], and insulin autoantibodies [IAAs]). The HLA genotypes were confirmed by the
central HLA Reference Laboratory at Roche Molecular Systems (Oakland, CA) for enrolled
participants. The present report includes TEDDY children with the HLA DR3/DR4-DQ8 or
the HLA DR4-DQ8/DR4-DQ8 genotype, without a first-degree relative with type 1 diabetes, if
at least 1 blood sample was obtained after birth (Fig 1). This included 4,543 participants (2,278
[50.1%] girls). At analysis (follow-up to 31 May 2016), the median age of these children was
6.7 years (interquartile range, 2.5 to 8.6 years). Written informed consent was obtained for all

 study participants from a parent or primary caretaker for genetic screening and to participate
in the prospective follow-up. The study was approved by local institutional review boards and
is monitored by an external advisory board established by the US National Institutes of Health.
TEDDY study outcomes
Islet autoantibodies (IAAs, GADA, and IA-2A) were measured by radiobinding assays every 3
months for the first 4 years and biannually thereafter. In the US, autoantibodies were mea-
sured at the Barbara Davis Center for Childhood Diabetes at the University of Colorado Den-
ver reference laboratory. In Europe, autoantibodies were measured at the University of Bristol,
the UK reference laboratory. All radiobinding assays were performed as previously described
Fig 1. Flow diagram of the TEDDY study participants included in this analysis.

 [2,23]. Samples positive for islet autoantibodies were retested at the second reference labora-
tory for confirmation. The outcome of islet autoantibody positivity was defined as a positive
result at both reference laboratories (confirmed) and the presence of islet autoantibodies
(GADA, IA-2A, or IAAs) on 2 or more consecutive visits (persistent). The date of seroconver-
sion to islet autoantibodies (time to first autoantibody) was defined as the date of drawing the
first of the 2 consecutive positive samples. The presence of persistent multiple islet autoanti-
bodies was defined as the presence of at least 2 persistent and confirmed islet autoantibodies.
The date of persistent multiple islet autoantibodies was defined as the date of drawing the first
sample for which the second persistent and confirmed islet autoantibody was detected.
Children with positive islet autoantibodies that were due to maternal IgG transmission
were not considered to be positive for that autoantibody unless the child had a negative sample
before the first positive sample or the autoantibody persisted beyond 18 months of age [2].
Diabetes was diagnosed according to American Diabetes Association criteria [24].
Single nucleotide polymorphism typing
In the TEDDY study, single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) of immune-related genes were
genotyped using the Illumina ImmunoChip [25]. For SNPs rs11755527 (BACH2) and rs689
(INS), which were not available on the immunochip, the SNPs rs3757247 (BACH2) and
rs1004446 (INS) were used (S1 Table). No proxy SNPs were available for rs917997 (IL18RAP).
Genetic scores
Genetic scores were determined as described by Winkler et al. [15], without including the
intercept value from the logistic regression, and as described by Oram et al. [16]. The Winkler
score was originally derived from the Type 1 Diabetes Genetics Consortium case–control data-
set, and the Oram score was originally based on the odds ratios available on ImmunoBase
(http://www.t1dbase.org/). The genetic score of each individual was derived from weighted
values given to the HLA DR3/DR4-DQ8 or DR4-DQ8/DR4-DQ8 genotype plus a weighted
value assigned to each susceptible allele of non-HLA SNPs for the Winkler score and HLA
class I and non-HLA SNPs for the Oram score (S1 Table). A total of 39/40 non-HLA class II
SNPs used in the Winkler score and 26/28 non-HLA class II SNPs used in the Oram score
were available to calculate the genetic score in the TEDDY children, while 35/40 and 26/28
SNPs were available for the case–control cohort. For both scores, the HLA DR-DQ genotype
weights were added to the weighted risks for each SNP according to the child’s number of risk
alleles (0, 1, or 2) for each SNP (S1 Table). Additionally, since the Winkler and Oram scores
were derived from partially overlapping genetic loci and each had distinct features, a merged
genetic score was derived using the information for all available SNPs contained in the Wink-
ler and Oram scores and was calculated for the TEDDY children (S1 Table). For simplicity,
when SNPs overlapped in the Winkler and Oram scores, the mean weight of each SNP in the
Winkler and Oram scores was used in the merged score, and for SNPs that were unique in the
Winkler or the Oram score, the weight used in the original score was used for the merged
score. Exceptions were for 2 SNPs (rs2069763 and rs3825932) that had a negative weight in the
Winkler score but a positive weight in the Oram score, where the original Oram score weight
was used to calculate the merged score.
Statistical analyses
An analysis plan was submitted to the TEDDY data coordinating center and approved by the
TEDDY steering committee prior to compiling and analyzing the data (S1 Appendix). The
merged score was added to this once both the Winkler and Oram scores were found to stratify

 risk. The Cox analysis and specificity analysis prescribed in the analysis plan were no longer
considered to be sufficiently informative to include in the final analysis. The analysis was
extended to include type 1 diabetes risk during revision of the manuscript.
For TEDDY children, the cumulative risks of developing islet autoantibodies, multiple islet
autoantibodies, and diabetes were estimated using the Kaplan–Meier method and were com-
pared between risk groups using the log-rank test. The risks of islet autoantibodies, multiple
islet autoantibodies, and diabetes were calculated for increasing thresholds of the Winkler,
Oram, and merged genetic scores. Analyses were also performed after stratification by HLA
genotype, geographic location (US, Europe), and sex. The sensitivity of the genetic scores was
assessed by calculating the proportion of children who developed islet autoantibodies, multiple
islet autoantibodies, and diabetes whose genetic score was above the threshold value. Spear-
man’s correlation coefficient was used to assess whether the autoantibody risk by age 6 years
or diabetes risk by age 10 years—and sensitivity for cases that developed by age 6 years or by
age 10 years—changed with increasing score thresholds. The proportion of children in the
general population who would be expected to have a genetic score above the threshold was
calculated based on the frequency of children with the HLA DR3/DR4-DQ8 or DR4-DQ8/
DR4-DQ8 genotype (2.9%) identified in the screening phase of the TEDDY study [22].
For the case–control dataset, we calculated the proportions of non-diabetic controls and
cases of type 1 diabetes whose genetic score exceeded the thresholds, with score increments of
0.1. The sensitivity of the genetic scores was assessed by calculating the proportion of cases
within the cohort who had a score above the threshold. The empirical risk was calculated as
the ratio of the proportion of cases to the proportion of controls above the threshold multiplied
by the assumed background risk of 5% for individuals with the DR3/DR4-DQ8 or DR4-DQ8/
DR4-DQ8 genotype [11].
The distribution of genetic scores was compared among groups defined by islet autoanti-
body outcome, geographic location (US, Europe), or sex using the Mann–Whitney U test.
All analyses were performed using R 3.3.2 software (R Foundation for Statistical Comput-
ing, Vienna, Austria), IBM SPSS version 22.0 (IBM, Armonk, NY), and SAS 9.4 (SAS Institute,
Cary, NC).
The datasets generated and analyzed during the current study are available in the NIDDK
Central Repository at https://www.niddkrepository.org/studies/teddy. TEDDY immunochip
(SNP) data that support the findings of this study have been deposited in NCBI’s Database of
Genotypes and Phenotypes (dbGaP) with the primary accession code phs001037.v1.p1.
Results
Genetic scores in the case–control population
The Winkler and Oram genetic scores in the WTCCC HLA DR3/DR4-DQ8 or DR4-DQ8/
DR4-DQ8 cases were increased as compared to the UK Biobank HLA DR3/DR4-DQ8 or
DR4-DQ8/DR4-DQ8 controls (P < 0.001; S1 Fig). Using the Winkler score, the calculated
actual risk reached 10% above a threshold of 11.72, corresponding to a sensitivity of 58.7%
(95% CI 55.2%–62.2%) for the patients who had the HLA DR3/DR4-DQ8 or DR4-DQ8/
DR4-DQ8 genotype. Using the Oram score, an actual risk of 10% was reached above a score
threshold of 11.67, corresponding to a sensitivity of 36.6% (95% CI 33.2%–40.0%; S1 Fig).
Having verified both scores for type 1 diabetes risk stratification in the case–control dataset,
we reasoned that a composite score that included all the features from the Winkler and Oram
scores would be justified. We therefore developed a merged genetic score that represented the
average weighted values of loci, genotypes, and alleles common to the Winkler and Oram
scores, and the original weighted values for loci and alleles that were unique to 1 of the scores

 (S1 Table). Using the prospectively followed TEDDY cohort, we then asked how well the
Winkler, Oram, and merged scores could stratify the risk for pre-symptomatic type 1 diabetes.
Baseline risk for islet autoantibodies and diabetes in TEDDY children with
HLA DR3/DR4-DQ8 or DR4-DQ8/DR4-DQ8 genotype without family
history of type 1 diabetes
Seroconversion to islet autoantibodies occurred in 386 children (8.5%) (166 [43.0%] girls), and
4,157 children (91.5%) remained islet autoantibody negative (2,112 [50.8%] girls). Of the 386
children with islet autoantibodies, 241 children (62.4%) developed multiple islet autoantibod-
ies (102 [42.3%] girls; 81 [33.6%] from US). A total of 107 (2.3%) developed diabetes by age 10
years (47 [43.9%] girls). The cumulative risk for developing islet autoantibodies was 9.2% (95%
CI 8.2%–10.1%; Fig 2A), of developing multiple islet autoantibodies (pre-symptomatic type 1
diabetes) by age 6 years was 5.8% (95% CI 5.0%–6.6%; Fig 2B), and of developing diabetes by
age 10 years was 3.7% (95% CI 3.0%–4.4%; Fig 2C).
Genetic scores in TEDDY children
We examined whether Winkler, Oram, and merged genetic scores were increased in children
who developed islet autoantibodies. The genetic scores were calculated in 3,498 (1,471 US)
children who had material for additional genetic analysis. The median follow-up in these chil-
dren was 7.39 years. For each of the Winkler, Oram, and merged scores, the score was greater
in children who developed islet autoantibodies by 6 years of age as compared to children who
remained islet autoantibody negative (P < 0.001; Fig 3A and S2 Fig). The median merged
score was 14.3 (IQR, 13.6–14.9) in children who developed islet autoantibodies versus 13.7
(IQR, 13.1–14.4) in children who remained islet autoantibody negative. The genetic scores
were also slightly greater in European children (median merged score, 13.8; IQR, 13.1–14.5)
than in US children (13.7; IQR, 13.1–14.4; P = 0.003; Fig 3B and S2 Fig). The frequencies of
minor alleles differed between the US and European children for 7 of 43 SNPs (Bonferroni-
corrected P of 0.05/43 = 0.0012; S2 Table). Scores were not different between boys and girls

Risk for islet autoantibodies and diabetes according to the genetic scores
We next asked if and how much the genetic scores could stratify risk in TEDDY children with-
out a family history of type 1 diabetes. To address this, the cumulative risk for developing islet

 autoantibodies and for diabetes was compared between HLA DR3/DR4-DQ8 and DR4-DQ8/
DR4-DQ8 children who were in the upper quartile, middle 2 quartiles, and lower quartile of
the merged genetic score (Fig 4). The cumulative risk for developing islet autoantibodies by 6
years of age was 16.0% (95% CI 13.3%–18.6%) among children with a merged genetic score of
>14.4, representing the upper quartile, compared with 6.9% (95% CI 5.9%–8.0%) in children
with a score of �14.4 (P < 0.001). The cumulative risk for developing multiple islet autoanti-
bodies by 6 years of age was 11.0% (95% CI 8.7%–13.3%) in children with a score of >14.4,
compared with 4.1% (95% CI 3.3%–4.9%) in children with a score of �14.4 (P < 0.001).
The cumulative risk for developing diabetes by age 10 years was 7.6% (95% CI 5.3%–9.9%) in
children with a score of >14.4, compared with 2.7% (95% CI 1.9%–3.6%) in children with
a score of �14.4 (P < 0.001). The risks were also stratified by the Winkler and Oram scores
(P < 0.001; S3 Fig). However, the merged genetic score performed better than both the Wink-
ler and Oram scores in identifying the HLA DR3/DR4-DQ8 and HLA DR4-DQ8/DR4-DQ8
children who developed multiple islet autoantibodies (S4 Fig).
The merged genetic score stratified the risk for islet and multiple islet autoantibodies and
for diabetes both in children who had the HLA DR3/DR4-DQ8 genotype and in children who

 had the HLA DR4-DQ8/DR4-DQ8 genotype (S5 Fig). The risks of islet autoantibodies, multi-
ple islet autoantibodies, and diabetes in children with a merged genetic score of >14.4 were
not significantly different between US and European children (P = 0.16, P = 0.97, and P = 0.96,
respectively; S6 Fig), but autoantibody risks were higher in boys than in girls (P = 0.001 for 1
or more islet autoantibodies and P = 0.01 for multiple islet autoantibodies; S6 Fig).
Sensitivity versus risk for islet autoantibodies and diabetes according to the
merged genetic score
Islet autoantibody and diabetes risk appeared incremental with increasing merged genetic
score. Since the efficiency of a test is measured by both sensitivity and positive predictive value
(risk), we examined the relationship between sensitivity and risk at increasing thresholds for
the genetic score (Fig 5; S3–S5 Tables). As predicted, the cumulative risk for developing islet
autoantibodies or multiple islet autoantibodies by age 6 years and diabetes by age 10 years
increased (P < 0.001) and the sensitivity decreased (P < 0.001) with each increment in the
genetic score threshold by the 5th percentile of the cohort. The risk for multiple islet

 autoantibodies reached a maximum of 13.2% (95% CI 9.2%–17.1%) above a threshold of
>15.1, which identified 38 of the 173 children who developed multiple islet autoantibodies by
age 6 years, corresponding to a sensitivity of 22.0% (95% CI 16.4%–28.7%). Above a threshold
of 14.4, representing the upper 25% of merged genetic score values and where risk for multiple
islet autoantibodies was 11.0% (95% CI 8.7%–13.3%), 82 of the 173 children who developed
multiple islet autoantibodies by age 6 years were identified (sensitivity, 47.4%; 95% CI 40.1%–
54.8%). In a population where the prevalence of HLA DR3/DR4-DQ8 and HLA DR4-DQ8/
DR4-DQ8 genotypes is similar to that of the TEDDY cohort (2.9%), using the threshold of
14.4 would identify <1% of all newborns without a prior family history of type 1 diabetes.
Discussion
Genetic scores derived from logistic regression of numerous loci associated with type 1 diabe-
tes susceptibility were able to stratify the risk for pre-symptomatic and clinical type 1 diabetes
in a prospective cohort of children with high-risk HLA genotypes but no family history of type
1 diabetes. The risks of developing islet autoantibodies, multiple islet autoantibodies, and dia-
betes increased with each increment in the genetic score. A genetic score that would identify
<1% of all newborn infants was associated with a risk for developing multiple islet autoanti-
bodies of >10% by 6 years of age. This compares to a background population risk of around
0.4% [26]. These findings provide a paradigm for identifying infants whose risk for developing
type 1 diabetes is more than 25 times that of the general population, twice that of infants iden-
tified by the highest-risk HLA genotypes alone, and higher than that of children with a first-
degree relative with type 1 diabetes.
The study was performed using a large number of children who were prospectively followed
for the development of islet autoantibodies from infancy. The findings were consistent
between US and European children and for 2 independently derived genetic scores that were
used to develop the merged genetic score. We note, however, that the risk scores were gener-
ated using the outcome of clinical, or stage 3, type 1 diabetes. It has been previously noted in
multiple studies, including TEDDY, that many, but not all of the genes associated with type 1
diabetes confer risk for islet autoantibodies [25,27]. For this reason, the performance of a
genetic score for identifying pre-symptomatic type 1 diabetes might improve if genes and
weights for islet autoantibody susceptibility are incorporated into the score. Genetic score per-
formance may also be improved if more accurate estimates of risk weight for homozygous ver-
sus heterozygous alleles were available. Of note, the score does not include all type 1 diabetes
susceptibility genes and does not contain weights for several HLA class I alleles that confer sus-
ceptibility for type 1 diabetes [28–30]. Finally, the current genetic scores were derived from
cohorts of mostly individuals of European descent, and it is likely that the genetic scores may
not be suitable for all races or ethnic groups.
The study was performed to extend the opportunities for early identification of individuals
at increased risk for disease. Previous primary prevention trials in type 1 diabetes involved
HLA typing of infants with a family history of type 1 diabetes [3,4,31]. The enrollment of par-
ticipants into these trials took several years, and the proportion of all cases of childhood type 1
diabetes that were represented by the inclusion criteria was less than 5%, limiting the gener-
alizability of trial outcomes. Screening that is limited to HLA typing of the general population
can identify individuals with 3% to 5% risk, which may be insufficient for enrollment into pri-
mary prevention studies in which infants are exposed to treatment. Indeed, the TRIGR study
used a combination of HLA typing and family history in order to identify infants whose risk
for type 1 diabetes was 10% [3]. Therefore, we set a risk target of 10%, which was achieved in
our study when we used the development of multiple islet autoantibodies as a marker for pre-
Genetic scores and risk for type 1 diabetes

 symptomatic type 1 diabetes. The risk threshold was reached when the Winkler, Oram, or
merged genetic score was used in children with the 2 highest-risk HLA genotypes, DR3/
DR4-DQ8 and DR4-DQ8/DR4-DQ8, which can be detected by typing 3 SNPs. In a European
population, these 2 genotypes were present in around 40% of all cases of childhood type 1 dia-
betes [11]. The merged genetic score threshold of >14.4 identified almost 50% of children
with these genotypes who developed multiple islet autoantibodies or diabetes. Therefore,
we surmise that our risk score threshold would identify up to 20% of children without family
history of type 1 diabetes who will develop the disease. Moreover, the screening strategy is
relatively inexpensive, and is now being used in the Primary Oral Insulin Trial (https://
clinicaltrials.gov/ct2/show/NCT03364868), where DNA extraction from blood spots and typ-
ing are performed for less than US$8 per sample. Extending the strategy to individuals with
other HLA genotypes is possible, but the other genotypes are less frequent in type 1 diabetes
and are associated with a lower risk than that conferred by the DR3/DR4-DQ8 and DR4-
DQ8/DR4-DQ8 genotypes. Therefore, the inclusion of other genotypes is unlikely to further
improve risk stratification.
In conclusion, a genetic score based on 3 SNPs for HLA class II genotyping and 41 SNPs in
other genes identified <1% of newborn children who, in the absence of a family history of type
1 diabetes, had a >10% risk for developing multiple islet autoantibodies by 6 years of age. This
greatly extends the possibilities of enrolling participants into clinical trials aimed at evaluating
type 1 diabetes prevention strategies that could be applied in infancy and before the develop-
ment of autoimmunity [32].

S4 Fig. Time-dependent discrimination accuracy of the genetic scores to identify TEDDY
children who developed multiple islet autoantibodies. Three scores are compared
(RO = Oram score, WI = Winkler score, ME = merged score). (A) We calculated the integral of
a time-dependent receiver operating characteristic curve [33], indicated on the y-axis for each
genetic risk score from 1 year to 10 years with increments of 100 days. (B) To obtain a distribu-
tion for each of these predicted scores, we performed 2,000 paired bootstrap analyses for each
genetic risk score, with the results shown as box pots (diamonds indicate the integrated area
under the curve [AUC] for the full TEDDY data). These bootstrap analyses were further used to
assess statistical differences of the time-dependent receiver operating characteristic curve esti-
mates per genetic risk score. To this end, we calculated Bayes factors of the paired estimates
[34] of 2 risk scores. Specifically, the Bayes factor of risk score 1 (RS1) versus risk score 2 (RS2)
is calculated as the posterior probability of the alternative hypothesis (RS1 is better than RS2),
defined as the fraction of bootstrap analyses in which RS1 is better than RS2, divided by the pos-
terior probability of the null hypothesis (RS1 is no better than RS2), defined as the fraction of
bootstrap analyses in which RS1 is no better than RS2. We denoted the merged genetic score as
superior to the Winkler score (Bayes factor = 6.2) and Oram score (Bayes factor = 94), and no
difference between the Winkler score and Oram score, with a Bayes factor of 1.2 [35].
