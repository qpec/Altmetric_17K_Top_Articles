Susceptibility to chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD)
beyond cigarette smoking is incompletely understood, although
several genetic variants associated with COPD are known to
regulate airway branch development. We demonstrate that in
vivo central airway branch variants are present in 26.5% of the
general population, are unchanged over 10 y, and exhibit strong
familial aggregation. The most common airway branch variant is
associated with COPD in two cohorts (n = 5,054), with greater
central airway bifurcation density, and with emphysema through-
out the lung. The second most common airway branch variant is
associated with COPD among smokers, with narrower airway lu-
mens in all lobes, and with genetic polymorphisms within the
FGF10 gene. We conclude that central airway branch variation,
readily detected by computed tomography, is a biomarker of
widely altered lung structure with a genetic basis and represents
a COPD susceptibility factor.

C
hronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) is the third
leading cause of death and a major cause of disability glob-
ally (1, 2). Cigarette smoking is the major COPD risk factor (3),
but COPD is not rare among those who have never smoked
cigarettes, and many smokers do not develop COPD (4). Fur-
thermore, approximately half of older adults with COPD exhibit
low lung function early in life (5). These observations suggest
that host factors beyond smoking may contribute to COPD risk
and may create opportunities for personalized disease pre-
vention and treatment.
The tracheobronchial tree serves as the conduit for gas ex-
change and acts as a filter of inhaled particulate matter. Airway
bifurcations are major sites of inhaled particulate matter de-
position (6), and alterations in these sites may contribute to
differential deposition patterns of harmful particulate matter
(e.g., cigarette smoke) and beneficial particles (e.g., inhaled
bronchodilators) that could, respectively, affect disease risk and
therapeutic response. Airway lumen caliber directly determines
airflow resistance (7), which contributes to airflow limitation and
respiratory symptoms (8). Hence, image-based anatomic markers
of widely altered airway tree structure may facilitate personali-
zation of COPD risk and treatment.
Genome-wide association studies (GWAS) for lung function
and COPD have identified several genes (9, 10), including HHIP,
LTBP4, SOX5, and TGFBR3, that regulate tracheobronchial tree
formation in utero (11–14) and thus may have consequences for
airway structure and postnatal disease susceptibility. Small autopsy
studies showed frequent variation in the branching of the seg-
mental airways in the lower, but not upper, lobes (15, 16). Com-
parative physiologists believe this variation may exist because the
Significance
The human airway tree is a filter of noxious particulate matter,
the primary cause of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease
(COPD). We demonstrate that variation in central airway tree
branching occurs in over one-quarter of the general population
and increases COPD susceptibility, particularly among smokers.
We show that these central airway branch variants are bio-
markers of altered distal lung structure, the primary site of
COPD pathobiology. Finally, we demonstrate the heritability of
central airway branch variants within families and identify and
replicate an association with FGF10. These findings suggest
that central airway branch variants, easily detectable by com-
puted tomography, represent heritable biomarkers of widely
altered lung structure and a COPD susceptibility factor.

 human species is not ventilation limited, thus reducing the selection
pressure for a single conserved ventilation apparatus (17). In our
modern environment, however, the airway tree must interact with
noxious particulate matter (e.g., cigarette smoke, air pollution), the
primary cause of COPD (8). Therefore, in this modern context,
airway branch variation may be implicated in COPD pathogenesis.
In the present study we demonstrate that lower-lobe seg-
mental airway branch variants are common in a large multiethnic
population-based sample and among smokers in a COPD cohort
and that these airway branch variants are associated with COPD
and respiratory symptoms. In addition, we demonstrate that these
common airway branch variants, easily identifiable on computed
tomography (CT), indicate more generalized alterations in airway
lumen caliber and branching and emphysema throughout the lung.
Finally, we demonstrate the heritability of these airway branch
variants and evaluate candidate genes known to regulate airway
tree morphogenesis. Taken together, our findings suggest that a
simple CT-based measure of central airway anatomy reflects ge-
netically determined alterations in structure throughout the lung
that predispose to COPD risk and provides a tool to facilitate
personalized strategies for prevention and treatment.
Results
Prevalence of Central Airway Branch Variation in the General
Population. We first sought to determine the prevalence of airway
branch variants in a large human cohort sampled from the general
population. The Multi-Ethnic Study of Atherosclerosis (MESA)
Lung Study performed chest CT scans for 3,169 participants (SI
Appendix, Fig. S1). Their mean age was 69 ± 9 y, 48% were male,
and the race/ethnic distribution was 39% white, 27% African-
American, 21% Hispanic, and 13% Asian-American. Fifty-four
percent were current or former smokers, with a median exposure
of 15 pack-years (calculated as the number of years of smoking ×
the number of cigarette packs smoked per day ÷ 20) (SI Appendix,
Table S1).
Airway branch variation was observed in 26.5% (95% CI:
24.9–27.8%) of participants. The most common airway branch
variant was an accessory subsuperior airway (16.0%; 95% CI:
14.6–17.2%), followed by an absent right medial-basal airway
(6.1%; 95% CI: 5.3–6.9%). These common airway branch vari-
ants are shown in Fig. 1. Four percent of participants had rare airway
branch variants, such as an accessory left medial-basal airway,
tracheal or carinal airway, or combinations of the above-mentioned
variants. The remaining 73.5% had no airway branch variants, that
is, standard airway anatomy.
An accessory subsuperior segmental airway was more com-
mon among whites and less common among Asian-Americans,
whereas an absent right medial-basal airway was more common
among Asian-Americans and less common among African-
Americans (SI Appendix, Table S2). There were minor dif-
ferences in gender, body size, lung volume, and smoking status
with airway branch variants, whereas the prevalence of a childhood
diagnosis of asthma and living with a smoker during childhood
were similar (P ≥ 0.125) (SI Appendix, Table S2).
Common Airway Branch Variation and COPD. We next determined
whether the common airway branch variants were associated with
COPD defined by standard postbronchodilator spirometry (8) in
the MESA Lung Study and in the Subpopulations and Intermediate
Outcome Measures in COPD Study (SPIROMICS), a large case-
control study of COPD that used the identical CT protocol. There
were 243 cases of COPD and 2,065 controls without airflow limi-
tation in the MESA Lung Study (SI Appendix, Table S3) and
1,823 cases of COPD and 923 controls in the SPIROMICS. The
characteristics of MESA Lung and SPIROMICS participants by
COPD status are summarized in SI Appendix, Table S4.
The presence of an accessory subsuperior segmental airway
was associated with 1.64 higher odds of COPD (95% CI: 1.18–
2.29; P = 0.004) compared with standard anatomy in the MESA
Lung Study. This airway branch variant was also significantly asso-
ciated with COPD in SPIROMICS (Table 1), and the pooled odds
ratio (OR) for COPD in the two cohorts was 1.40 (95% CI: 1.19–
1.64; P < 0.001). This association changed little with multivariable
adjustment for potential confounders (Table 1) and did not differ
between smokers and nonsmokers (P interaction = 0.222).
Absence of the right medial-basal segmental airway was not
significantly associated with COPD in the MESA Lung Study
(Table 1); however, there was evidence for an interaction by
smoking status (P interaction = 0.006), and among smokers the
OR for COPD was 2.04 (95% CI: 1.13–3.71; P = 0.019). Among
smokers in SPIROMICS, this variant was associated with
1.71 higher odds of COPD (95% CI: 1.19–2.47; P = 0.004). The

Representative 3D airway reconstructions from chest CT scans of
participants with standard lower-lobe anatomy (A), an accessory subsuperior
airway branch variant (B), and absent right medial-basal airway branch
variant (C). Standard lower-lobe segmental airway anatomy was defined as
the presence of right and left superior, anterior-basal, lateral-basal, and
posterior-basal segmental airways; the presence of the right medial-basal
airway; absence of the left medial-basal airway; and absence of sub-
superior segmental airway. (See SI Appendix, Fig. S2 for details.) A variant
lower-lobe segmental airway, defined as any deviation from standard
anatomy, with a prevalence above 5% in the MESA Lung Study was con-
sidered common. The remaining 4% of participants in the MESA Lung Study
had rare or combinations of variants.

 pooled OR for COPD was 1.55 (95% CI: 1.15–2.08; P = 0.004)
overall and 1.78 (95% CI: 1.27–2.49; P < 0.001) among smokers.
The associations between these common airway branch vari-
ants and COPD did not differ by gender (P interaction ≥ 0.161),
race/ethnicity (P interaction ≥ 0.112), presence of childhood asthma
(P interaction ≥ 0.222), or living with a smoker during childhood (P
interaction ≥ 0.247) in study-specific or pooled analyses. Maternal
smoking during pregnancy, assessed in SPIROMICS only, did not
differ by common airway branch variant status (P = 0.348) and
did not modify the association between these airway branch var-
iants and COPD (P interaction ≥ 0.586). Defining COPD by the
lower limit of normal (18) or by the combination of spirometric
criteria and symptoms (8) yielded similar results (SI Appendix,
Tables S5 and S6).
The presence of a tracheal or carinal airway was uncommon
(0.8% in both studies), and there was no statistical association with
COPD in study-specific or adjusted pooled analyses, although CIs
were wide (SI Appendix, Table S7).
Common Airway Branch Variation and Respiratory Symptoms. An
accessory subsuperior airway was associated with chronic bronchitis,
which is defined by chronic productive cough (19), in SPIROMICS
and in the pooled analysis (SI Appendix, Table S8). It was also as-
sociated with worse scores on the COPD Assessment Test (CAT)
(multivariate mean difference 0.9, 95% CI: 0.2–1.6; P = 0.008) and
the St. George Respiratory Questionnaire for COPD (SGRG-C)
(multivariate mean difference 2.4, 95% CI: 0.8–4.0; P = 0.004) (SI
Appendix, Table S9). These differences were of greater magnitude
and approached thresholds of clinically significant differences
among patients with COPD (multivariate mean difference in CAT
and SGRQ-C: 1.2 95% CI: 0.4–2.0 and 3.6 95% CI: 1.6–5.5, re-
spectively; P ≤ 0.004) (SI Appendix, Table S10). This airway branch
variant was not significantly associated with dyspnea (SI Appendix,
Table S8).
In contrast, the absence of a right medial-basal airway was
significantly associated with dyspnea in SPIROMICS and pooled
analyses (SI Appendix, Table S8) but was not significantly asso-
ciated with symptoms of chronic bronchitis or with CAT or
SGRQ-C scores (SI Appendix, Tables S8 and S9).
Common Airway Branch Variation and Lung Structure. Since it would
be surprising that central airway branch variation alone would
contribute to disease and symptoms, we examined if branch vari-
ation represented more widespread changes in lung morphology,
particularly in nonaffected lobes of the lung.
In the MESA Lung Study and SPIROMICS, we found that
CT-resolved airway segment lengths were 3.7% shorter (95% CI:
2.5–4.9%; P < 0.001) among participants with an accessory
subsuperior airway than among those with standard anatomy,
independent of lung volume. Shorter central airways were pre-
sent not just in the variant-containing lobe but also in all other
lobes in the lung (SI Appendix, Fig. S4), suggesting a generalized
developmental process.
We therefore examined the peripheral lung structure of this
airway branch variant. The presence of an accessory subsuperior
airway demonstrated a higher percentage of emphysema-like
lung in all lobes in SPIROMICS and in the pooled analysis (P <
0.001; SI Appendix, Table S11). Further examination using in-
haled hyperpolarized helium-3 (3He) apparent diffusion coeffi-
cients (ADCs), a measure of alveolar size, among 20 smokers
matched for gender, height, and COPD status (SI Appendix,
Table S12) revealed that the presence of an accessory sub-
superior airway was associated with higher ADC than seen with
standard anatomy (P = 0.002) (Fig. 2). This difference remained
significant when restricting the analysis to participants without
emphysema on CT (n = 14; P = 0.001). The central airway lumen

 participants with an accessory subsuperior airway was similar to
those in subjects with standard anatomy (SI Appendix, Fig. S4).
Airway morphology was different in participants with an ab-
sent right medial-basal airway. These individuals had signifi-
cantly smaller airway lumen areas in all lobes of the lung,
suggesting a generalized process (Fig. 3 and SI Appendix, Fig.
S4). CT-resolved airway lengths in the branch variant-containing
lobe were greater than in participants with standard anatomy (SI
Appendix, Fig. S4) but were similar in the lobes not containing the
branch variant, and there was no evidence in adjusted analyses that
percent emphysema was increased in any lobe (SI Appendix, Table
S11) or that ADC was increased (P = 0.841).
Results stratified by cohort (MESA Lung Study and SPIROMICS)
were largely similar (SI Appendix, Figs. S5 and S6), without evi-
dence of effect modification by cohort (P interaction > 0.144).
Stability of Common Airway Branch Variants over 10 y. Given the
caliber and central position of these common airway branch
variants in the airway tree, we hypothesized that their presence/
absence did not change over time. Among the 300 MESA par-
ticipants in whom anatomy was compared using images spanning
a 10-y interval, there was no discordance in lower-lobe segmental
airway anatomy (κ = 1.0), suggesting that these airway branch
variants are not acquired in late adulthood.
Candidate Gene-Association Analysis of Common Airway Branch
Variants. Given the stability of central airway branch variants over
a decade, we examined their heritability, hypothesizing a de-
velopmental origin. Sixteen unrelated participants in the MESA
Family Study exhibiting a common airway branch variant were
identified, and their sibling airway anatomy was assessed while
masked to index case anatomy (sibship size range: 2–6; n = 64).
The prevalence of an accessory subsuperior airway in siblings was
46% (95% CI: 30–62%), higher than the prevalence of 16% ob-
served in the overall study population (P = 0.002). The prevalence
of an absent right medial-basal airway in a sibling was 31% (95%
CI: 8–69%), higher than the prevalence of 6% seen in the overall
study population (P = 0.02). Given these results, we hypothesized
that airway branch variants could reflect altered function of genes
regulating airway morphogenesis.
A targeted gene analysis involving 109 SNPs located within
11 candidate genes was conducted (SI Appendix, Table S13). The
absence of the right medial-basal airway was associated with two
SNPs on chromosome 5. SNPs rs980510 and rs10512844 are sep-
arated by 20.2 kb, are in low linkage disequilibrium (r2 = 0.38), and
are located within the same intron of FGF10 (Fig. 4). Multiplica-
tive and recessive allelic association models identified the same
locus but with greater statistical significance (P = 1.33 × 10−5 and
P = 2.94 × 10−6, respectively). There was no evidence of hetero-
geneity by race/ethnic subgroups (I2 = 0%). In contrast, the pres-
ence of an accessory subsuperior airway was not associated with the
selected SNPs in the 11 candidate genes (SI Appendix, Table S13).
The genetic association between FGF10 and absence of the
right medial-basal airway was replicated in an independent co-
hort (SPIROMICS; rs980510; OR: 1.42, P = 0.008) (SI Appendix,
Table S14).

 Discussion
Variant branching of the segmental airways was observed in one-
quarter of participants in a large population-based multiethnic
sample. The most common airway branch variant, an accessory
subsuperior airway, was associated with higher odds of COPD
and chronic bronchitis, a higher number of central airway bi-
furcations, and larger airspaces in all lobes. The second most
common airway branch variant, absence of the right medial-basal
airway, was associated with higher odds of COPD among smokers
and of dyspnea and with smaller airway lumens in all lobes. This
airway branch variant exhibited familial aggregation and was as-
sociated with intronic SNPs in FGF10, which replicated in an in-
dependent cohort. These findings suggest that airway branch
variation, which is common and easily identifiable, reflects widely
altered lung structure and provides a genetically determined an-
atomical basis for COPD susceptibility.
This study represents by far the largest assessment of variant airway
anatomy, but the observed prevalence was comparable to that in early
surgical/autopsy series (15, 16). For example, Yamashita reported an
accessory subsuperior airway prevalence of 14.0–14.3% and an absent
right medial-basal airway prevalence of 7.8% in 180 specimens. The
minor differences in prevalence estimates are likely due to the
small numbers and overrepresentation of the diseased lungs in
autopsy series and, potentially, differences by race/ethnicity.
This study assesses the association of common airway branch
variation with COPD and symptoms. The magnitude of the ob-
served associations with COPD was as large or larger than those
reported for gene variants in GWAS (9), suggesting that person-
alized intervention strategies based on these airway variants might
yield clinically important results. For example, these readily de-
tected airway variants may facilitate the identification of people
at increased risk of COPD or, conversely, identify the COPD
subgroup of persons who exhibit low lung function in early life but
who do not experience accelerated disease progression (5). Lon-
gitudinal research is needed to determine if such image-based
phenotyping can facilitate the identification of those most likely
to benefit from COPD prevention or treatment strategies and
minimize testing of ineffective interventions in those at low risk of
disease incidence or progression (20).
Airway tree structure is fractal in nature (patterning is similar
across scales) (7), and study of murine lung development sug-
gests that proximal variation in airway anatomy, arising from an
altered genetic branching program, may iterate to produce an
altered distal airway tree (21), the primary site of COPD path-
ophysiology (22, 23). The presence of an accessory subsuperior
airway was associated with shorter central airways in all lobes,
independent of lung volume. While these differences were modest
over four airway generations, the cumulative deficit in airway
length may require larger airspaces to fill the remaining lung vol-
ume. Indeed, the presence of an accessory subsuperior airway was
associated with higher percent emphysema on CT and higher ADC
for inhaled 3He, suggesting larger airspaces (24, 25). Alternatively,
if airway development is programmed to fill the lung volume, then
the observed 3.7% shorter central airways observed in the present
analysis would require three to five additional peripheral airway
generations [∼75,000–1,000,000 excess airway bifurcations, depend-
ing on the conducting airway model (26–28)] compared with
standard anatomy. Airway bifurcations are major sites of inhaled
particle deposition, including particle sizes typical of cigarette
smoke and environmental air pollution (29, 30), and may con-
tribute to the higher odds of chronic bronchitis observed among
smokers with this airway branch variant.
The absence of the right medial-basal airway was associated
with smaller airway lumens in all lobes for a given lung volume
(dysanapsis) (31). Airway lumen caliber is a major structural de-
terminant of airways resistance and airflow (32) and may con-
tribute to the higher odds of COPD and dyspnea associated with
this variant. The absence of the right medial-basal airway was also
associated with FGF10 intronic SNPs, suggesting a genetically
programmed airway structure–function endotype, either through
changes in protein coding or through gene regulation. FGF10 is
critical for airway tree morphogenesis (33–36), and FGF10 mu-
tations are associated with a rare syndrome of aplasia of the lac-
rimal and salivary glands (ALSG) (37). The salivary and lacrimal
glands, similar to the airway tree, are branched structures. A study
of young patients with ALSG (mean age: 39 y) showed greater
airflow obstruction than in their unaffected siblings, but an
endotypic mechanism was not identified (38). Notably, the FGF10-
associated airway branch variant was associated with COPD only
among smokers. This observation suggests that absence of the right
medial-basal airway may be a biomarker of FGF10-mediated
airway lumen narrowing and increased airways resistance that are
insufficient to cause COPD alone but may interact with environ-
mental exposures, such as cigarette smoke, to augment suscepti-
bility to clinically symptomatic COPD. Alternatively, airway branch
variation and COPD may not be mechanistically related but in-
stead may share a common cause (e.g., FGF10 may regulate airway
morphogenesis, yielding branch variation, and, independently,
regulate airway injury response that contributes to COPD) (39–41).
The present study has limitations. First, the human cross-
sectional analyses may have introduced some selection bias; al-
though one study was population-based, the proportion included
of those selected was high (90%), and variant segmental airway
anatomy was unrelated to missing spirometry. Cross-sectional
studies can also be subject to reverse causation; however, it is
very unlikely that COPD caused such proximal changes in the
airways, and we observed no changes in lower-lobe segmental
airway anatomy over 10 y. Nevertheless, longitudinal data are
required to determine whether central airway branch variants
precede clinical lung disease or instead may indicate low lung

Regional association plot of candidate SNPs located within the
FGF10 gene and the absent right medial-basal airway variant. Candidate
SNPs were selected a priori based on their location within genes implicated
in airway morphogenesis (11 genes, 109 SNPs). Genotyping: Affymetrix 6.0,
excluding MAF <0.5, missingness per SNP >0.1, missingness per subject >0.1,
and linkage disequilibrium >0.7. Candidate SNPs within FGF10 are indicated
by diamond symbols. The degree of linkage disequilibrium with rs980510 is
indicated by the R2 color scale. Square symbols indicate regional FGF10 SNPs
not included in the candidate gene analysis. ORs and P values were calcu-
lated using an additive allelic model for each race/ethnic group, adjusted for
gender and genetic ancestry principle components, and pooled by random
effects meta-analysis. I2 is an index of effect measure heterogeneity by race/
ethnicity. The Bonferroni P threshold of 4.59E−04 [−log(4.59E−04) = 3.34] is

 function in early life (5). Furthermore, such longitudinal data
should assess other early life exposures not accounted for in the
present studies (e.g., prematurity).
Blinding of the anatomy readers may have been incomplete due
to visualization of emphysema on CT. It is highly unlikely, how-
ever, that this affected results: Assessment of the central airway
anatomy is straightforward (SI Appendix, Fig. S2), resulting in
excellent reproducibility [better than the scoring of emphysema
by expert radiologists (42, 43)]; the scans were not assessed for
emphysema at the same time; and the association of emphy-
sema and COPD is modest (44).
We performed a candidate gene analysis with focused SNP
analysis rather than a hypothesis-free GWAS. This targeted ap-
proach identified an association with FGF10 polymorphisms. We
believe this is unlikely to represent a false-positive result, as we
replicated the association in an independent cohort. Neverthe-
less, experimental and functional data are needed, and it is likely
that other genes are implicated in the development of these
common airway branch variants.
In summary, central airway branch variation, readily detected by
CT, was common in a large multiethnic population-based sample,
was associated with COPD as well as with respiratory symptoms in
two large cohorts, and reflected diffuse changes throughout the
lungs. Further, we have identified at least one form of central airway
branch variation associated with COPD that appears to be linked to
a genetic etiology. Taken together, our findings suggest that certain
central airway branch variants serve as a biomarker of more widely
altered lung structure that has implications for airflow resistance
and gas exchange and also may influence the pulmonary deposition
of environmental toxicants (including cigarette smoke) and inhaled
therapies. Additional studies are needed to determine if personal-
ized intervention based upon these variants is warranted.
Methods
Prevalence of Central Airway Branch Variation in the General Population and
Associations with COPD and Respiratory Symptoms.
Study participants. The MESA is a multicenter, prospective cohort study of whites,
African-Americans, Hispanics, and Chinese-Americans in the United States (45).
MESA recruited 6,814 men and women 45–84 y of age in 2000–2002 from the
general population in six communities. Exclusion criteria were clinical cardio-
vascular disease, weight over 136 kg, pregnancy, and impediments to long-term
follow-up. The MESA Lung Study enrolled participants sampled from MESA who
underwent measurements of endothelial function, consented to genetic anal-
yses, and completed an examination in 2004–2006 (46) and all participants in the
MESA Air Pollution Study, who were recruited under the same enrollment cri-
teria as MESA (47). The present analysis included MESA Lung Study participants
who underwent a chest CT scan in the fifth MESA examination in 2010–2012 (SI
Appendix, Fig. S1) and used measures from this examination, except as noted.
The SPIROMICS recruited cases of COPD and controls, 40–80 y of age with at
least 20 pack-years of smoking, as well as 200 nonsmoker controls, in 2010–2015
(48). Exclusion criteria included other chronic lung diseases except asthma, body
mass index >40 kg/m2, prior lung resection, metal in the chest, and pregnancy.
Nonsmoker controls were excluded from the current analysis.
Institutional review board approval was obtained at each of the clinical
study sites for both studies [MESA: Columbia University, Johns Hopkins
University, Northwestern University, University of California (UC) Los Angeles,
University of Minnesota, Wake Forest University; SPIROMICS: Columbia
University, Johns Hopkins University, National Jewish, Temple University,
University of Alabama at Birmingham, University of Illinois, University of
Iowa, (UC) Los Angeles, University of Michigan, (UC) San Francisco, University
of Utah, Wake Forest University] (https://www.mesa-nhlbi.org/ and www.
spiromics.org/spiromics/ParticipatingInstitutions). Written informed con-
sent was obtained from all participants.
Chest CT acquisition. Participants underwent full-lung chest inspiratory CT on
64-slice or 128-slice helical scanners (120 kVp, 0.625–0.75 mm slice thickness,
0.5 s rotation time) following the same highly standardized protocol in both
studies (49).
MESA Lung Study participants also underwent cardiac CT scans in 2000–2002
(50), which provided complete imaging of the lower-lobe segmental airways.
Airway branch variation. Standard multiplanar image reformatting software
(OsiriX 64-bit v8.4; Pixmeo) was used to visualize segmental airways arising
from the local long axis of the right and left lower-lobe airways. We focused on
lower-lobe segmental airway variants based on the high prevalence described
in early autopsy studies (15, 16). In contrast, these studies reported accessory or
absent segmental airways in other lobes to be rare (<1%), and we confirmed
this in an initial five-lobe reading of 318 MESA COPD CT scans, in which we
observed no accessory or absent segmental airways in the upper lobes.
Airway branch variants were ascertained by readers unaware of other
participant information. The presence or absence of superior, subsuperior,
medial-basal, anterior-basal, lateral-basal, and posterior-basal segmental
airways was determined according to the descriptions of Yamashita (SI Ap-
pendix, Fig. S2) (15). Examples of the multiplanar images are shown in SI
Appendix, Fig. S3. Interrater reproducibility of airway branch variants by
masked assessment of 50 CT scans by two raters was excellent (interrater κ
0.94; 95% CI: 0.86–1.00; P < 0.0001).
The superior segmental airway was defined as the first (i.e., most proximal)
airway originating from the lower-lobe stem. The subsuperior segmental
airway was defined as an airway originating from the lower-lobe stem, in-
ferior (i.e., distal) to the superior segmental airway but not extending to the
basal region. The medial-basal airway was defined as an airway originating
from the lower-lobe stem, oriented medially, extending to the basal regions
of the lobe, and passing anterior, posterior, or both anterior and posterior to
the basal vein (15). The remaining basal segmental airways (anterior-basal,
lateral-basal, and posterior-basal) were defined as airways originating from
the lower-lobe stem and extending to their respective basal regions. Airways
arising distal to these basal segmental branches were not evaluated.
Standard lower-lobe segmental airway anatomy was defined as the presence
of right and left superior, anterior-basal, lateral-basal, and posterior-basal seg-
mental airways; presence of the right medial-basal segmental airway; absence of
the left medial-basal airway; and absence of the subsuperior segmental airway
(15). Variant lower-lobe segmental airway anatomy was defined as any deviation
from standard anatomy.
We also assessed CT scan images for the presence of an airway originating
from the trachea or main carina (16).
COPD and respiratory symptoms. Spirometry was performed following Ameri-
can Thoracic Society recommendations (51) on a dry-rolling-seal spirometer in
the MESA Lung Study and a pneumotachograph in SPIROMICS. Predicted
values and limits of normal were calculated using reference equations (52).
COPD was defined as a postbronchodilator forced expiratory volume in 1 s
(FEV1) to forced vital capacity (FVC) ratio <0.7 (8). COPD defined by an FEV1/
FVC ratio below the lower limit of normal and by an FEV1/FVC ratio <0.7 with
dyspnea or chronic bronchitis symptoms was used in sensitivity analyses (8).
Dyspnea was assessed using the modified Medical Research Council
breathlessness scale (53), with scores above 0 corresponding to increasing
levels of dyspnea-associated disability. Chronic bronchitis was defined by
affirmative responses to questions about cough and phlegm production
for ≥3 mo each year for at least two consecutive years (19). In SPIROMICS,
respiratory health status was assessed using the CAT (54) and the SGRQ-C,
with higher scores indicating greater impairment (55). The CAT test consists
of eight questions and yields a score from 0 (no impact) to 40 (very high
impact). The SGRQ-C consists of 40 questions and yields a score from 0 (no
impairment) to 100 (worst possible health). The minimum clinically important
differences for the CAT and SGRQ-C scores are 2 and 4, respectively (56, 57).
Statistical analysis. The prevalence of airway branch variants was calculated
and 95% CIs were estimated using SAS 9.3 (SAS Software).
The ORs for COPD were calculated using logistic regression to adjust for
age, gender, race/ethnicity, height, weight, smoking status, and pack-years of
cigarette smoking (58). Effect modification was assessed with interaction terms
in the full models. Pooled analyses of MESA Lung Study and SPIROMICS par-
ticipants included a term for study.
Dyspnea, presence of chronic bronchitis, CAT, and SGRQ-C scores were com-
pared according to airway branch variants using logistic and linear regression,
respectively, adjusted for the same covariates. Analyses including SPIROMICS
participants were additionally adjusted for COPD status to account for the case-
control design.
Statistical analyses were performed using SAS 9.3 (SAS Software), and
statistical significance was defined by a two-tailed P < 0.05.
Common Airway Branch Variation and Lung Structure.
Quantitative assessment of airway dimensions and percent emphysema. Lobar
volumes, attenuation, and central airway tree anatomy were assessed on chest CT
scans for the MESA Lung Study and SPIROMICS at a single reading center (VIDA
Diagnostics, Inc.) without knowledge of other participant information (32, 49).
Airways were labeled and measured anatomically from trachea to sub-
subsegmental bronchi along five prespecified paths (RB1, RB4, RB10, LB1,
and LB10), and segmentation and labeling were visually verified by a dedicated

 image analyst (49). Cross-sectional airway lumen areas were measured within
an image plane perpendicular to the local airway segment long axis using a
subvoxel-resolution algorithm, within an image plane, and measurements were
averaged along the middle third of each labeled airway. Airway length was
measured as the distance between bifurcation points.
The percentage of emphysema-like lung (percent emphysema) was defined
as the percentage of voxels within the lung field less than −950 Hounsfield
units, based on pathological comparisons (59), and calculated for the
whole lung as well as each lobe.
The reproducibility of quantitative CT measures assessed by replicate scans
was excellent (SI Appendix, Table S15).
3HE apparent diffusion coefficients. The MESA COPD Study recruited cases of
COPD and controls between 2010 and 2011 predominantly from MESA and
the Emphysema and Cancer Action Project, a nonoverlapping lung cancer
screening study, and also from the outpatient community at Columbia
University Medical Center (42). Included participants were 50–79 y of age
with at least a 10 pack-year smoking history. Exclusion criteria were clinical
cardiovascular disease, advanced kidney disease, asthma before age 45 y,
prior lung resection, pregnancy, or contraindication to MRI.
The definitions of postbronchodilator spirometry and COPD status
matched the MESA Lung Study protocol (described above), as did the full-
lung CT protocol and percent emphysema quantification (described above).
Between 2015 and 2017, 3He MRI was performed in a subset of 60 MESA COPD
Study participants at the Columbia University site. Hyperpolarized 3He MRI ADCs
were measured using a Phillips 3T scanner with a flexible wrap-around 3He
radiofrequency coil. The 3He was polarized to 29 ± 5.7% using a GE spin-exchange
polarizer. After a proton survey scan, 3D ADC scans were acquired without and
with diffusion-sensitizing gradients corresponding to b-values of 0 and 1.6 s/cm2.
The reconstructed voxel size was 3.5 × 3.5 × 40.0 mm. The participant was asked
to breathe in 1 L of 3He gas mixture (350 mL of 3He gas with 650 mL of nitrogen)
from residual volume with instructions to continue to breathe in a room-air
chaser to “top off” the lungs up to total lung capacity. ADCs were calculated
using a semiautomated approach programmed in Matlab to segment ventilated
lung. An ADC heat map was generated for each of five coronal slices.
Covariates. Age, gender, and race/ethnicity were self-reported. Current smoking
was defined as self-reported cigarette smoking in the prior 30 d and was
confirmed by plasma or urinary cotinine levels. Nonsmoker status was defined
as having smoked fewer than 100 cigarettes lifelong. A childhood diagnosis of
asthma, living with a smoker during childhood, and maternal smoking during
pregnancy were self-reported, and the last was assessed in SPIROMICS only.
Height and weight were measured using standardized protocols.
Statistical analysis. Airway lumen areas and lengths by lobe were compared
according to airway branch variant status using linear regression to adjust for
the lung lobe volume achieved at the time of CT, study cohort, and COPD
status where indicated.
Percent emphysema was log-transformed to approximate a normal dis-
tribution and was compared according to airway branch variant status using
linear regression adjusted for age, gender, height, weight, smoking status,
and pack-years of cigarette smoking.
ADC was log-transformed to approximate a normal distribution. Ten
participants with an accessory subsuperior airway were matched 1:1 with
10 participants with standard anatomy, and two participants with an absent
right medial-basal airway were matched 1:4 with participants with standard
anatomy, for gender, height within 5 cm, and COPD status. Mean differences
in ADC were calculated using generalized estimating equation regression to
account for five ADC measures (slices) per participant and to adjust for matching
cluster. Sensitivity analyses additionally adjusted for log-transformed percent
emphysemaand restricted analysis to those with less than 5% emphysemaon CT.
Statistical analyses were performed using SAS 9.3, and statistical signifi-
cance was defined by a two-tailed P < 0.05.
Stability of Common Airway Branch Variants over 10 y. The 10-y change in
airway anatomy was evaluated among 100 MESA participants with standard
anatomy and 100 participants with each airway branch variant, sampled at
random, by assessment of prior MESA cardiac CT scans, masked to findings
from full-lung scans.
Within-participant stability of airway anatomy was assessed by κ statistic.
Candidate Gene-Association Analysis of Common Airway Branch Variants.
Familial aggregation. The MESA Family Study enrolled and performed cardiac CT
on 1,595 African American and Hispanic family members in 2004–2007 using the
same inclusion/exclusion criteria as MESA (60). We assessed airway anatomy for
100 unrelated participants selected at random using the protocol described
above (see Airway branch variation). This yielded 11 index cases with an ac-
cessory subsuperior variant and five index cases with an absent right medial-
basal variant. We then assessed airway anatomy for the siblings of index cases
in random order and blinded to index case anatomy. The prevalence of each
airway branch variant among siblings of index cases was computed and
compared with the population-based prevalence of the airway branch variant.
Genotyping. MESA Lung Study participants who consented to genetic analysis
were genotyped using the Affymetrix Human SNP array 6.0, of which
2,597 had full-lung CT imaging that permitted airway anatomy assessment
(accessory subsuperior airway: 398; absent right medial-basal airway: 172).
SNPs included in the analysis were required to have minor allele frequency
(MAF) above 0.05, missingness per marker below 0.1, missingness per indi-
vidual below 0.1, and to pass the Hardy–Weinberg equilibrium test (P <
0.001). Markers in linkage disequilibrium above 0.7 were also excluded (Plink
v1.07; 50 SNP window, five SNP shift), leaving 246,539 markers.
Replication of the top FGF10 polymorphism association (rs980510) was
performed in SPIROMICS. Genotype data for the SPIROMICS sample were
derived from OmniExpressExome BeadChip (Illumina) (61).
Candidate SNP selection. Of 20 candidate genes selected a priori based on their
known role in airway tree morphogenesis (62), 11 contained SNPs that passed
the filtering and linkage disequilibrium criteria listed above, for a total of
109 candidate SNPs.
Power to detect an airway branch variant–SNP association was estimated
using the observed prevalence of airway branch variants in the population-
based cohort, assuming a disease allele frequency of 0.5 and accepting one
false positive for the total number of SNPs compared. Because the central
airway tree phenotype is thought to form prenatally (63), and systematic
review of genetic effect sizes for early-life phenotypes demonstrates sig-
nificantly higher effect sizes (OR >1.5) (64), we assumed a genotype effect
size of 1.5. Power for additive and multiplicative association models for the
accessory subsuperior airway branch variant was above 99% and for the
absent right medial-basal airway branch variant was 76% and 92%, re-
spectively (65).
Statistical analysis. Common airway branch variant-SNP associations were
tested under an additive model using logistic regression to adjust for gender
and principal components of genetic ancestry (66). Analyses were stratified
by race/ethnicity and were pooled by random effects meta-analysis. A con-
servative Bonferroni threshold was used to define a statistically significant
association (p-Bonferroni 0.05/109 = 4.59 × 10−4).
The main replication analysis was restricted to white participants because
the sample was predominantly white and was adjusted for gender and
principal components of genetic ancestry. Secondary analysis included all
race/ethnicities and an additional adjustment term for race.
