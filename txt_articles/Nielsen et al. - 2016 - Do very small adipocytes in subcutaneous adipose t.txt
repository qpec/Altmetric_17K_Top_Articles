Background & aims: Previous studies have shown that fetal life
malnutrition affects preferences for fat deposition in the body
thereby predisposing for visceral adipocity and associated disor-
ders in glucose-insulin regulation. In this study, we aimed to test
the hypotheses that late-gestation undernutrition 1) has long-term

exposure to an obesogenic diet in early postnatal life.
Methods: Twin-bearing last trimester ewes received diets supplying
100% (NORM) or 50% (LOW) of protein and energy requirements.
Lambs received moderate, low-fat (CONV) or high-carbohydrate-
high-fat (HCHF) diets from 3-days until 6-months of age (just after
puberty), and then half the lambs (including all males) were sacri-
ficed. Remaining animals (exclusively females) received a low-fat,
grass-based diet until sacrificed at 2-years of age (adulthood). In

 determined. Histological evaluations were performed of subcu-
taneous and perirenal fat. The late-gestation undernutrition reduced
whole-body insulin sensitivity and increased the risk of obesity-
induced mesenteric adiposity in the sheep used in the experiment.
Results: A deviating morphology of subcutaneous adipose tissue
with greater occurrence of very small adipocytes (<40 mm in
diameter) and collagen infiltration was observed in the non-obese
LOW/CONV lambs, and after dietary correction (and associated
body fat loss) it became apparent in all adult LOW sheep. LOW
lambs deposited more fat in visceral compared to subcutaneous fat
when exposed to the obesogenic HCHF diet. Prenatal undernutri-
tion had differential impacts in subcutaneous versus perirenal fat
on expressions of glucose-insulin signaling and lipid metabolism
genes and on fatty acid composition, but these prenatal impacts
were not sustained into adulthood, except to a limited extent in
perirenal fat, where C14:0 was decreased in LOW sheep.
Conclusions: The present study showed that greater preponder-
ance of very small adipocytes, increased collagen infiltration and
reduced subcutaneous lipid accumulation ability, as well as altered
perirenal fat preferences for accumulation of C14:0 can have a fetal
origin. Disturbance of normal (subcutaneous) adipose tissue
development may play a key role in linking fetal malnutrition to
disease risk later in life.

 1. Introduction
Visceral adipocity is a major risk factor predisposing for development of insulin resistance and
dysregulation of peripheral glucose uptake, however preferences for deposition of fat in the body may
develop without associated disorders in glucose-insulin regulation [1,2]. Previous studies have shown
that visceral and ectopic fat deposition are influenced by the ability of the subcutaneous adipose tissue
(SUBAT) to expand in situations with excess availability of nutrients, and a reduced subcutaneous
expandability will increase the risk of lipid overflow and fat deposition in other adipose depots and in
non-adipose tissues [3,4]. Restricted subcutaneous expandability has been linked to inability of adi-
pocytes to differentiate properly [5], and interestingly, development of insulin resistance and adipose
inflammation in equally obese human subjects appear to be associated with the presence of a distinct
sub-population of very small adipocytes (<40 mm in diameter) [5,6]. Thus, adipose tissues are not only
organs passively responding to stimuli implicated in disorders such as obesity and the metabolic
syndrome [7,8], but organs with distinct developmental trajectories and regulatory functions, which
can contribute to the development of obesity related disorders.
It has been known for some time that exposure to nutrient restriction in late gestation can pre-
dispose for glucose intolerance, insulin resistance and abdominal obesity later in life [9e11]. In-
dividuals exposed to undernutrition in fetal life are often born small-for-gestational-age with an
increased ratio of visceral-to-subcutaneous fat [12,13], and the reduced subcutaneous expandability
can persist into adult life [14]. This suggests that fetal life history have differential implications for
development and maturation in different adipose tissues by as yet unknown mechanisms, which in
turn affects their metabolic functions and expandabilities later in life.
In this study, we aimed to test the hypotheses that late-gestation undernutrition 1) has long-term
differential impacts on development, expandability and metabolic features in subcutaneous as
compared to perirenal and mesenteric adipose tissues, which 2) will predispose for visceral obesity
upon exposure to an obesogenic diet in postnatal life.
To test these hypotheses, we used our Copenhagen sheep model [14] to assess impacts of un-
dernutrition during late gestation equivalent to the human third trimester. Adipose morphology,
gene expression for markers of insulin signaling and energy metabolism, and fatty acid (FA)
composition were studied in three adipose depots: mesenteric (MESAT), subcutaneous (SUBAT),
and perirenal (PRAT) adipose tissues at 6-months (just after puberty) and 2-years (young adult-
hood) of age.
2. Materials and methods
Handling of experimental animals and all experimental procedures were approved by The Danish
National Committee on Animal Experimentation and conducted in accordance with the EU Directive
2010/63/EU for animal experiments. The animal experiments were conducted at the experimental farm
Rørrendegård, Faculty of Health and Medical Sciences, University of Copenhagen, Denmark. This report
adhere to the ARRIVE Guidelines for reporting of animal experiments [15].
2.1. Experimental animals and treatments
The detailed information about the experimental animals and treatments has been earlier re-
ported [14]. In short, 21 twin-pregnant ewes were during the last six weeks of gestation
(term ¼ 147 days) fed either a diet fulfilling the daily requirements for both energy and protein
(N ¼ 10; NORM) or 50% of these requirements (N ¼ 11; LOW). From 3-days to 6-months of age,
twin-lambs were allocated to each their diet: conventional (CONV; hay supplemented by milk
replacer from 3-days to 8-weeks of age; adjusted to achieve moderate daily growth rates of 250 g
day-1) or high-carbohydrate-high-fat (HCHF; max. 1 kg popped maize day-1, max. 0.5 L 38% fat
dairy cream, and max 2.0 L milk replacer day-1 until 8-weeks of age and reduced to 0.5 L day-1
from 8-weeks to 6-months of age). At 6-months of age (after puberty), half of the lambs were
sacrificed (15 male lambs plus 3 females), where after remaining lambs (18 females) were managed

 as one group, all receiving the same low-fat, non-obesogenic grass-based diet from 6 months until
2-years of age (young adulthood) and then sacrificed. This latter diet consisted of grass silage
provided according to daily energy and protein requirements in the winter (OctobereApril) and
pasture in the summer time (MayeSeptember). This resulted in four experimental groups (numbers
of animals studied at 6-months/2-years of age are given in parenthesis): NORM/CONV (N ¼ 5/5),
NORM/HCHF (N ¼ 4/4), LOW/CONV (N ¼ 5/4), and LOW/HCHF (N ¼ 5/5). At sacrifice, SUBAT (above
the longissimus dorsi muscle) and two metabolically active abdominal adipose tissues in sheep:
MESAT and PRAT were quickly dissected out, and samples were snap-frozen in liquid nitrogen and
stored at �80 �C for gene expression and FA composition analysis or transferred to 4% PFA solution
for histological evaluations.
2.2. Histology
Fixation of adipose tissues in PFA, embedding in paraffin, mounting of tissue sections in DPX-
mounting-media (WVR, Herlev, Denmark) and Van Gieson staining for collagen/connective tissue
infiltration were performed as described previously [16]. Paraffin blocks for MESAT were impos-
sible to cut, and therefore histological evaluations were performed only on PRAT and SUBAT. For
each block, two consecutive sections from each of three different sites in the block were collected
(in total six) and they were separated by >300 mm to ensure that a given cell could not be rep-
resented in different sections. Five photos were taken randomly from one section from each site
(i.e. a total of 15 photos per tissue per animal) at 10� and 5� magnification in PRAT and SUBAT,
respectively, due to differences in intensities of staining in tissues from particularly HCHF fed
lambs. Tissue sections were unbiased assigned a grade for different characteristics evaluated by
visual comparison with reference pictures. Cell size was graded by 3- and 5-point scales,
respectively, in PRAT and SUBAT, which had different variability in cell size (Supplementary Table
1). Only pictures devoid of significant presence of non-adipose structures were used for this
purpose. Cross-sectional-area was manually determined in randomly chosen adipocytes in the
reference pictures by applying a 15-point transparent grid using ImageJ software [17]. Grades were
also assigned to all pictures for occurrence of a sub-population of very small cells (0 ¼ no very
small cells, 5 ¼ large occurrence of very small cells), and in SUBAT these were manually charac-
terized to have a mean cross-sectional area <1250 mm2, equivalent to a diameter of <40 mm in a
sphere with such a cross-sectional area. The extent of collagen infiltration was graded in all pic-
tures by a 4-point scale ranging from 5 to 70% collagen infiltration (Supplementary Fig. 1). Collagen
infiltration in reference pictures was calculated as the proportion of hits on a given tissue structure
relative to the total number of hits in the whole picture using a 28-points transparent grid, as
described previously [18].
2.3. RNA extraction and quantitative real-time PCR (qPCR)
RNA extraction, cDNA synthesis, quantity and integrity of isolated RNA and qPCR were performed as
described previously [19] using beta-actin (ACTB) as reference gene. Adipose tissue samples (~120 mg)
were homogenized and used for RNA extraction. RNA samples were only used for cDNA synthesis when
RIN values were �6.5.
Expression levels were determined by qPCR for target genes known [20] to be involved in
adipose tissues in basal and insulin stimulated glucose uptake (glucose transporter 1, GLUT1;
and glucose transporter 4, GLUT4; respectively), insulin signaling (insulin receptor subunit beta;
INSRb; insulin receptor substrate 1, IRS1), lipid metabolism (lipogenesis: FA synthase, FAS;
lipolysis: peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor alpha, PPARa), preadipocyte differentiation
(peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor gamma, PPARg), mitochondrial-derived reactive ox-
ygen species control (uncoupling protein 2, UCP2) and angiogenesis (vascular endothelial growth
factor, VEGF), leptin synthesis (leptin), as well as fat mass and obesity-associated protein (FTO).
For each gene, a six-point standard curve was made, and efficiencies (¼10�1/(slope of
standard
curve)) of primers were between 1.8 and 2.1 (which is equal to an increase of 80% and 110% of
target nucleic acid in each amplification cycle, respectively) (Supplementary Table 2). All
M.O. Nielsen et al. / Clinical Nutrition Experimental 8 (2016) 9e24

 coefficients of determination were �0.99. The original source of primer sequences have previ-
ously been published [18,19], except for UCP2 and leptin, which were designed, and primer
product size was confirmed by gel electrophoresis and PCR products sequenced to confirm
targets.
2.4. Lipid analysis
The total lipid fraction was extracted from tissue samples by the Folch procedure [21], but with
added water to compensate for the low water content of adipose tissues. The procedures for lipid
extraction, FA trans-methylation and subsequent characterization by gaseliquid chromatography
flame ionization detection were conducted as previously described [19].
2.5. Statistical analysis
Statistical analyses of qPCR and adipose histology data were performed using the SAS software ver.
9.2 (SAS Institute, Cary, NC, USA). Data for qPCR were first log transformed to fit normal distribution
and then analyzed by a PROC Mixed model including prenatal diet, postnatal diet, age and their in-
teractions as fixed effects and interaction of dam and lamb as random effect. Data for grading of
adipocyte size and collagen infiltration were analyzed by one-way ANOVA on the four different
experimental groups for 6-months old lambs and 2-years old sheep separately using the PROC
NPAR1WAY procedure based on the distribution of Wilcoxon scores, and the Bonferonni correction was
applied for multiple comparisons. Data for lipid contents were analyzed by two-way ANOVA with
Prism 5 software (GraphPad Software, San Diego, CA, USA), using pre- and postnatal diet as inde-
pendent factors. Data for lipid FA composition were also analyzed by principal component analysis
(PCA) using the version 2.15.2 of the R software (R Foundation for Statistical Computing) as reported
previously [19], and graphs were generated from Prism 5 software (GraphPad Software, San Diego, CA,
USA).
3. Results
It should be noted that the impacts of prenatal and early-postnatal nutrition on adipose tissues
characteristics at 6-months of age can be evaluated for males only, and at 2-years of age only for fe-
males, since all males had to be sacrificed at 6-months of age due to practical constraints. However,
metabolic and endocrine responses during glucose, insulin and fasting tolerance tests were evaluated
as previously reported [16,22] in all female and male lambs at 6-months of age, where gender effects
were rare and mainly associated with fat deposition patterns [14]. Age-related changes for the
mentioned traits have been evaluated in the female sheep studied at both 6-months and 2-years of age
[16,22]. These previously published results will be referred to in the discussion when relevant to put
the present findings into perspective.
As previously reported by Nielsen et al. [14], the HCHF compared to CONV diet induced extensive fat
deposition in lambs (but not 2 year old female sheep) in MESAT (278 vs. 1803 g ~3.88 and 2.07% of body
weight, respectively) and PRAT (123 vs. 1129 g ~0.31 vs. 2.42% of body weight, respectively) and thicker
dorsal SUBAT layer (1.60 vs. 0.96 mm) (P < 0.001 for all). CT scans of females showed that LOW
compared to NORM lambs and adult sheep had thinner dorsal SUBAT layer (1.60 vs. 13.17 mm), and
LOW-HCHF female lambs had higher ratios of visceral:subcutaneous fat (0.69) compared to NORM-
HCHF (0.49) and CONV fed (appr. 0.1) (P < 0.01).
3.1. Adipose tissue histology
Six-months old (adolescent) lambs: The postnatal obesogenic HCHF as compared to CONV diet
expectedly induced a massive increase in adipocyte cell size in SUBAT (P ¼ 0.01; Fig. 1A: panels to the
right) and PRAT (P ¼ 0.0037; Supplementary Fig. 2A: panels to the right). SUBAT from HCHF fed lambs
(Fig. 1A: panels to the right) as well as from NORM/CONV lambs (Fig. 1A: top left) contained adipocytes
of quite uniform size and with a characteristic angular shape and with little non-adipocyte structures

13
 (particularly in HCHF fed lambs). SUBAT from LOW/CONV lambs (Fig. 1A: bottom left) had more
extensive presence of collagen and non-collagen extracellular material compared to the other groups
(P ¼ 0.02; P ¼ 0.038; P ¼ 0.085 vs. NORM/HCHF, LOW/HCHF and NORM/CONV, respectively) with cell
shapes of more irregular appearance and greater numbers of very small adipocytes (<1250 mm2
equivalent to <40 mm in diameter in a sphere with similar cross-sectional area). All PRAT pictures taken
in lambs as well as in adult sheep contained very little extracellular material and was devoid of very
small adipocytes irrespectively of the pre- or postnatal nutrition exposure (Supplementary Fig. 2).
Two-years old (adult) sheep: The deviating SUBAT morphology of LOW/CONV lambs (higher pro-
portion of extracellular matrix including collagen and a more numerous population of very small cells)
was observable also in adulthood (Fig. 1B top left), and interestingly became evident also in the LOW/
HCHF adults (Fig. 1B top right) after they had been fed a moderate diet for 1½ years and normalized
their body fat content [14]. There were no differences in the overall adipocyte size grading between the
groups, but LOW/CONV had more collagen infiltration compared to NORM/CONV sheep (P ¼ 0.038)
(not significant compared to LOW/HCHF). Maximum scores for collagen infiltration and occurrence of
very small cells were only assigned to SUBAT from LOW sheep (in 4 out of the 9 sheep). No NORM sheep
scored higher than 2 for collagen infiltration.
3.2. Adipose tissue gene expressions
Expressions of all the studied genes were affected by the prenatal nutrition history, but in a tissue
and age-specific way.
Six-months old (adolescent) lambs: Prenatal nutrition impacts were observed exclusively in SUBAT
(Fig. 2). The non-obese LOW/CONV lambs had higher mRNA expressions in SUBAT for IRS1, FAS, FTO
(Fig. 2 panels b, d and f, respectively, all P < 0.05) compared to the other three groups and of PPARa
compared to LOW/HCHF lambs (P < 0.05, Fig. 2c). UCP2 expression on the other hand was reduced in
both LOW groups compared to NORM/CONV (P < 0.05, Fig. 2e).
The postnatal diet affected mRNA expressions in all three adipose tissues, but MESAT was the most
responsive. Thus in HCHF lambs, MESAT mRNA expressions were reduced for INSRb, IRS1, GLUT4, PPARa,
PPARg, FAS, FTO and VEGF (all P < 0.05, Supplementary Fig. 3). In SUBAT, the HCHF diet reduced mRNA
expressions for GLUT4 (P < 0.05, data not shown), IRS1 (P < 0.01, Fig. 2b), and FAS (P < 0.01, Fig. 2d),
whereas expression was increased for leptin (P < 0.05, data not shown). In PRAT, the HCHF lambs had
reduced mRNA expressions for GLUT4 (P < 0.001, Fig. 3b) and increased expression of leptin (P < 0.05,
data not shown) compared to CONV lambs.
Two-years old (adult) sheep: Fetally induced changes in gene expression emerged in PRAT and
MESAT in the adult sheep, which were not observed in lambs. In PRAT, LOW sheep had increased GLUT4
mRNA expression (P < 0.01, Fig. 3b), but reduced FAS expression (lower in both LOW groups compared
to NORM/CONV sheep; P < 0.05, Fig. 3d). In MESAT, LOW sheep had increased mRNA expression of
PPARa, and LOW/HCHF sheep had increased mRNA expressions of GLUT1 and VEGF (all P < 0.05,
Supplementary Fig. 3) compared to LOW/CONV sheep. In SUBAT, the fetal induced changes in gene
expression observed in lambs were no longer apparent in the adult sheep, except for FTO mRNA
expression, which was higher in LOW/HCHF compared to other sheep (P < 0.05, Fig. 2f), whereas the
highest expression level among lambs was in the LOW/CONV group.
None of the effects of the HCHF diet observed in lambs could be found in the adult sheep, but others
emerged. In PRAT, mRNA expression was increased for GLUT4 in HCHF sheep (contrary to what was
observed in lambs; P < 0.05, Fig. 3b), whereas INSRb expression was reduced among NORM sheep
previously fed the HCHF diet. In MESAT, VEGF and GLUT4 mRNA expression was as mentioned increased
(P < 0.05, Supplementary Fig. 3) in LOW/HCHF compared to LOW/CONV sheep (opposite to the
depressive effect of the HCHF diet in lambs).
3.3. Fatty acid composition in adipose tissues
Six months old (adolescent) lambs: The FA compositions of adipose tissues were as expected strongly
influenced by the postnatal diet (Fig. 4 and Supplementary Fig. 4). FA present in high concentrations in
fats from maize (linoleic acid, C18:2 n-6) and dairy cream (saturated FAs with chain lengths from C10 to

9 adult LOW sheep and not restricted to a specific early postnatal diet (pictures at the top) with extensive collagen infiltration (grade

nutrition during the last 6-weeks of gestation, where twin pregnant dams were fed diets fulfilling 100% of daily energy and protein
requirements or 50% of those requirements. CONV and HCHF refer to moderate or obesogenic, high-carbohydrate-high-fat diets,
respectively, fed to the lambs during the first 6 months of postnatal life.

 C16) were enriched in adipose tissues from the HCHF lambs fed this diet (P < 0.0001, Fig. 4 and
Supplementary Fig. 4). Despite higher intake of C17:0 from dairy fat, the HCHF compared to CONV
lambs had substantially lower adipose concentrations of this and other odd-chained FAs (P ¼ 0.0001,
Fig. 4), which are also synthesized endogenously from propionic acid, derived from forestomach
fermentation.
In MESAT and PRAT (Fig. 4a and b, respectively), linoleic acid concentration was higher in LOW
than NORM lambs when fed the CONV diet, but lowest in LOW lambs when fed the HCHF diet
(P < 0.05 for the pre- and postnatal dietary interaction), and n-6/n-3 polyunsaturated fatty acid ratios
became lower in all adipose tissues in LOW/HCHF compared to NORM/HCHF lambs (P < 0.005 for the

quirements or 50% of those requirements, respectively. CONV and HCHF refer to moderate and high-carbohydrate-high-fat diets,
respectively, fed to the lambs during the first 6 months of postnatal life. Legends are shown at the top right corner of panel a.

 pre- and postnatal nutrition interaction, Fig. 5). Concentrations of medium-chained FAs (MCFA,
C10eC14) tended to be increased in LOW lambs in MESAT (P ¼ 0.06, Fig. 4b) irrespective of the
postnatal diet.
Two years old (adult) sheep: Although all adult sheep had been fed the same low-fat diet for 1½
years, resulting in normalization of the body fat content of the HCHF sheep, FA composition (Fig. 6) in
adipose tissues, as shown in PCA plots (Supplementary Fig. 5), continued to reflect the diet received in
early postnatal life, but less pronounced than observed in the lambs. The FA patterns were very similar
across the three depots, and long-term effects of the prenatal nutrition history were only found in
PRAT, where LOW sheep had decreased contents of myristic acid (P < 0.01, Fig. 6) and increased C16:0/
C18:0 ratio (P < 0.05, Fig. 5), which was not observed in lambs.
4. Discussion
4.1. Fetal origin of very small adipocytes in subcutaneous adipose tissue
We are to our knowledge the first to demonstrate that occurrence of a special subpopulation of very
small adipocytes in SUBAT may have a fetal origin, but PRAT may not be similarly affected. Several
human studies have shown that a high preponderance of very small adipocytes in SUBAT is associated

 Fig. 6. Composition of total fatty acids (weight %) in adipose tissues of 2-years old sheep. Panel a, mesenteric fat; panel b, perirenal fat;
and panel c, subcutaneous fat. Seven classes of fatty acids are shown: saturated fatty acids (Saturated), monounsaturated fatty acids
(MUFA), polyunsaturated fattyacids (PUFA), omega-6 polyunsaturated fattyacids (n-6 PUFA), omega-3 polyunsaturated fattyacids (n-3
PUFA), odd chained fatty acids (Odd-chained), and medium chained fatty acids (6e12 carbon atoms, Medium-chained). Data are
expressed as mean ± standard deviation. NORM and LOW refer to prenatal nutrition during the last 6-weeks of gestation, where twin
pregnant dams were fed diets fulfilling 100% of dailyenergyand protein requirements or 50% of those requirements, respectively. CONV
and HCHF refer to moderate and high-carbohydrate-high-fat diets, respectively, fed to the lambs during the first 6 months of postnatal
life. Legends are shown on the top right of panel a. Experimental factors with P-values <0.05 are shown on top of the bars.
 with increased degree of insulin resistance in equally obese subjects [6,23] and increased expression of
inflammatory genes in SUBAT in healthy moderately obese humans [5]. In line with this, we have
previously reported that insulin sensitivity was reduced in LOW lambs and sheep and glucose intol-
erance was reduced in LOW-HCHF lambs used in this experiment [16]. Very small cells isolated by
collagenase digestion from SUBAT in the above-mentioned human studies had comparable diameters
(<40 mm) to those observed in this study in LOW animals (<1250 mm2 equivalent to <40 mm spherical
cell diameter).
Fetal derived morphological changes in SUBAT, evident in both lambs and adult sheep, could not be
linked to systematic changes in gene expression, which were only found in lambs. The increased SUBAT
expression of genes involved in insulin signaling and energy storage in LOW/CONV compared to
NORM/CONV lambs (Fig. 2) were not in line with the observed reduced SUBAT expandability and
aforementioned whole body insulin sensitivity in all LOW animals. Such paradoxical up-regulation of
insulin signaling molecules has, however, also been reported in skeletal muscle of insulin insensitive
human subjects associated with hyperinsulinemia [24], and could reflect a compensatory upregulation
in response to impaired insulin signaling distal to the insulin receptor, but this was clearly abolished
during obesity development (Fig. 2), and did not persist into adulthood.
Gene expression patterns determined on the total adipose cell population, as in this study, may
however not be representative of the SUBAT very small adipocytes [23,25]. Thus, isolated very small as
compared to large adipocytes have in other studies with human SUBAT [23] and epididymal fat from
obese Zucker rats [25] been found to have markedly reduced expressions of adipocyte differentiation
markers and markedly increased expressions of pro-inflammatory markers, and lower expression of a
marker, COL6A3, associated with insulin resistance [26].
Furthermore, reduced gene expressions in preadipocytes isolated from low birth weight men of
leptin and late differentiation markers such as PPARg2 and GLUT4 has been associated with a more
immature preadipocyte appearance and reduced ability to proliferate and differentiate [27]. This is
interesting, since extensive expansion of fat mass in SUBAT in humans [6] although initially relying
on hyperplasia, it relies much more extensively on a massive increase in adipose cell numbers
(hyperplasia) later on. Reduced hyperplasic ability could thus provide explanation for the reduced
expandability of SUBAT in LOW animals in this experiment, since adipocyte size (apart from the
subpopulation of very small adipocytes) were similar in obese LOW and NORM lambs fed the HCHF
diet.
We therefore suggest that late gestation undernutrition can give rise to development of a SUBAT
with greater preponderance of very small adipocytes and fibrosis, which renders the SUBAT unable
to expand normally in a nutrient surplus situation. Very small SUBAT adipocytes cannot, therefore,
be considered a sign of a healthy adipose tissue. Rather greater preponderance of such cells in-
dicates a dysfunctional SUBAT with reduced expandability, which according to [4] in nutrient sur-
plus situations will increase the risk of excessive fat storage in visceral and non-adipose tissues,
such as hepatocytes, b-cells and cardiomyocytes, with associated detrimental metabolic conse-
quences. Such reduced SUBAT expandability can explain the previously reported increased prefer-
ence for fat deposition in MESAT compared to SUBAT during obesity development in the LOW lambs
in our experiment [14], and the increased gene expressions observed in adult LOW sheep of GLUT4
in PRAT and of GLUT1, VEGF and PPARa in MESAT in LOW/HCHF compared to LOW/CONV sheep
would contribute to increase this risk. In contrast to SUBAT, gene expression changes related to fetal
nutrition in PRAT and MESAT were only observed in the adult sheep and not in lambs. Due to the
experimental design, we cannot rule out that this may reflect gender differences, rather than
changes in the timing of fetal manifestations in the adipose tissues or long-term impacts of the
altered expandability of SUBAT.
Another interesting observation was that prenatal undernutrition reduced accumulation of myristic
acid in PRAT with a tendency also in the other adipose tissues. The physiological role of myristic acid is
not very well understood, but it has been suggested that tissue levels are rate-limiting for protein
myristoylation, which is an important and ubiquitous process regulating activity of an estimated
0.5e3% of the human proteome [28]. These include proteins implicated in membrane targeting, pro-
teineprotein interactions, and a variety of signal transduction pathways. Thus, localization of the AMP-
activated kinase (AMPK) to the plasma membrane, its interaction and activation by LKB1 [29], and

21
 activation of an enzyme implicated in proinflammatory signaling, C-Jun N-terminal kinase (JNK)
stimulatory protein phosphatase 1 (JSP1) [30], are all dependent on myristoylation. Altered myristic
acid levels can therefore modify the tendency for adipose inflammation and associated development of
a metabolically unhealthy obese phenotype [30]. Future studies are needed to elucidate whether fetal
induced changes in adipose tissue myristic acid metabolism is linked to the pro-inflammatory prop-
erties observed in very small SUBAT adipocytes [5,25] and associated greater collagen infiltration as we
also observed in our sheep study (Fig. 1).
4.2. Effects of an obesogenic diet in early postnatal life are partly reversible
As previously reported, the obesogenic HCHF diet induced metabolic and endocrine changes
resembling the metabolic syndrome in humans, and these obesity induced changes observed in the
female lambs were to a large extent reversible upon feeding a moderate diet for 1½ years [14,16]. This
was also the case for the adipose tissue morphological and gene expression characteristics reported
here, except for the increased expressions for GLUT1 and VEGF in MESAT in adult LOW-HCHF compared
to LOW-CONV sheep, which as mentioned above may be associated with the greater preference for fat
deposition in MESAT over SUBAT in this group [14]. Thus, dietary intervention can be a potent in-
strument to correct damages induced by early postnatal obesity development in species born precocial
such as sheep, but individuals subjected to late fetal undernutrition may be limited in their capacity to
reverse such effects.
The major exception to this reversibility regards postnatal diet-induced changes in adipose FA
composition. Our results indicate that adipose tissues of sheep have a very slow turnover of FAs, as we
also previously observed in muscle [19].
In conclusion, the present study showed that greater preponderance of very small adipocytes,
increased collagen infiltration and reduced lipid accumulation ability in SUBAT, as well as altered PRAT
preferences for accumulation of myristic acid can have a fetal origin, which can increase the risk of
obesity-induced mesenteric adiposity. Disturbance of normal (subcutaneous) adipose tissue devel-
opment during fetal life may thus play a key role in linking fetal malnutrition to obesity-associated
disease risks later in life.
