Population scale data reveals the 
antidepressant effects of ketamine 
and other therapeutics approved 
for non-psychiatric indications
Isaac V. Cohen, Tigran Makunts, Rabia Atayee & Ruben Abagyan
Current therapeutic approaches to depression fail for millions of patients due to lag in clinical response 
and non-adherence. Here we provide new support for the antidepressant effect of an anesthetic 
drug, ketamine, by Inverse-Frequency Analysis of eight million reports from the FDA Adverse Effect 
Reporting System. The results of the examination of population scale data revealed that patients who 
received ketamine had significantly lower frequency of reports of depression than patients who took 
any other combination of drugs for pain. The analysis also revealed that patients who took ketamine 
had significantly lower frequency of reports of pain and opioid induced side effects, implying ketamine’s 
potential to act as a beneficial adjunct agent in pain management pharmacotherapy. Further, the 
Inverse-Frequency Analysis methodology provides robust statistical support for the antidepressant 
action of other currently approved therapeutics including diclofenac and minocycline.
The World Health Organization estimates depression as the 4th highest disease burden in the world1. In majority 
of the countries lifetime depression prevalence ranges 8–12%2–4. Current standard of practice of depression treat-
ment consists of five main classes of antidepressants, serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) being the most com-
mon. Nearly half of psychiatric and primary care patients discontinue their antidepressant therapy prematurely5. 
The main reasons for the discontinuation of therapy include late onset of beneficial outcomes, lack of efficacy for 
a fraction of patients, adverse reactions, fear of drug dependence, and lack of mechanisms to enforce adherence5. 
The initial therapeutic effect of antidepressants is delayed by 2–3 weeks after the first dose and the optimal effect 
is delayed by 6–10 weeks6. The long lag period renders the standard of care antidepressants ineffective for sui-
cidal patients who can’t afford to wait 2–6 weeks. Aside from the lag in antidepressant effects, there is insufficient 
evidence that antidepressants prevent suicide during long-term treatment7, and in many cases the antidepressant 
increases the risk of suicidal thoughts and actions8. Efficacy is another issue affecting depression treatment. In the 
STAR*D protocol study depression remission is 67% after every drug class and drug class combination is tried9.
Because of these problems, some clinicians have been driven to utilize other drugs, such as ketamine, for 
treatment resistant depression (TRD) patients10–12. Ketamine is a drug used illicitly as a hallucinogen and clin-
ically as an anesthetic since 1970’s. It is given intravenously, almost exclusively, due to a lack of an approved 
oral formulation. There have been some clinical trials where ketamine shows acute efficacy in treating TRD10,11, 
bipolar depression12 and major depressive disorder with suicidal ideation13, but the number of subjects in these 
trials ranges from 20 to 57 patients. There are financial and ethical obstacles for a larger scale clinical trial. Here 
we sought larger scale statistical evidence of ketamine antidepressant action in the FDA Adverse Event Reporting 
System (FAERS) postmarketing database containing over eight million patient records. Although FAERS was 
originally intended to track frequent adverse events, with sufficient amount of data, it can also be used to track the 
beneficial outcomes indirectly through monitoring reductions of related complaint frequencies. Here we apply 
Inverse-Frequency Analysis (IFA), which looks for statistically significant values of the negative log odds ratio 
(LogOR).
We found that patients listed in the FAERS database who received ketamine in addition to other therapeutics 
had significantly lower frequency of reports of depression than patients who took any other combination of drugs 
for pain (LogOR −
0.67 ± 0.034) (Fig. 1c). This reduction in depression is specific to ketamine and is known to

be much more rapid than current antidepressants, making this observed effect very promising for treatment 
of patients with acute depressive or suicidal episodes11. These patients cannot afford to wait up to six weeks 
for reductions in their depressive symptoms. Pain reports were also significantly lower for ketamine patients 
(LogOR −
0.41 ± 0.019) (Fig. 1c).
The analysis of the whole FAERS database revealed several other unintentional depression reducing drugs 
among antibiotics, cosmeceuticals and NSAIDS (Fig. 2). Our data supported previous studies that observed the 
psychiatric polypharmacology of minocycline, a tetracycline antibiotic14 (Fig. 2). The NSAID, diclofenac, was also 
observed to have some antidepressant properties (Fig. 2). It is theorized that both of these drugs may accomplish 
antidepressant effects through an anti-inflammatory mechanism15. Because of the antidepressant activity of sev-
eral NSAIDs, we further separated the non-ketamine pain cohort. Ketamine patients were then compared to 
patients who received any other combination of drugs for pain excluding NSAIDs. It was observed that depression 
event rates remained low (LogOR −
0.56 ± 0.035) (Fig. 2).
The reduction of depression rates in ketamine patient records makes a case for study of ketamine as a psy-
chiatric drug. These results imply that ketamine may be further explored as a monotherapy or adjunct therapy

for depression. It should also be noted that FAERS data revealed that ketamine use lead to renal side effects and 
awareness and caution in patients with renal or hepatic impairment may be warranted (Fig. 1a and b).
As an important side note, we also evaluated efficacy and side effects with the use of ketamine for pain man-
agement. We found that patients who were on ketamine had reduced opioid induced side effects including con-
stipation (LogOR −
0.17 ± 0.023), vomiting (LogOR −
0.16 ± 0.025), and nausea (LogOR −
0.45 ± 0.034) than 
patients who received any other combination of drugs for pain indications (Fig. 1d). Our data supports ketamine’s 
opioid-sparing properties and alludes to the fact that patients may receive benefits of improved pain, reduced 
requirement of opioids, and ultimately less opioid reduced side effects.
The results of this study support previous small scale studies’ conclusions that ketamine is a good monother-
apy or adjunct therapy for depression. In clinical practice ketamine would be especially useful for depression 
because of the quick onset of its action compared to existing first line therapies10–13. Regardless of the causative 
mechanism ketamine appears to have therapeutic potential for TRD. Further, the potential to reduce many of the 
most complained side effects of opioid treatment makes ketamine adjunct therapy for pain seem desirable.
Overall, this study demonstrates that the therapeutic potential of ketamine can be derived from appropriate 
statistical analysis of existing population scale data. This study also outlines a methodology for discovering off 
label pharmacology of existing approved drugs. This method can be applied to other indications and may reveal 
new important uses of already approved drugs, providing reliable justification for new indications without large 
investments in additional clinical trials.
Methods
This study used data from FDA Adverse Effect Reporting System database (FAERS)16 and its legacy ver-
sion, Adverse Effect Reporting System database (AERS)17, to perform a retrospective data analysis on 
the drugs of interest. Data from FAERS and AERS is available online at: http://www.fda.gov/Drugs/
GuidanceComplianceRegulatoryInformation/Surveillance/AdverseDrugEffects/ucm082193.htm.
FDA Adverse Event Reporting System. 
The FAERS database was created to support FDA’s post market-
ing surveillance on drugs and biologic therapeutics. It contains adverse reaction and medication error reports sent 
to the FDA through MedWatch, the FDA Safety Information and Adverse Event Reporting Program. Reporting is 
voluntary and is done by patients, family members, legal representatives, doctors, pharmacists and other health-
care providers. If any party reports an adverse effect to the manufacturer, the manufacturer is legally obligated 
to forward the report to the FDA18. Data is available online in quarterly format for AERS17 from the first quarter 
of 2004 to the third quarter of 2012 and for FAERS16 from the fourth quarter of 2012 to the first quarter of 2016.
Combining and normalizing the data set. 
For our study AERS and FAERS data sets were homogenized 
by modifying original text tables to produce a consistent table field structure. The combining was performed by 
individually downloading the FAERS and AERS quarterly reports in dollar separated text format (*.TXT). The 
names of columns were also homogenized and the columns missing from older releases were added with empty 
values.
The study used over 8 million adverse event reports from first quarter of 2004 to the first quarter of 2016. All 
the quarterly files from 2004 to 2016 were combined into a master file which was used as the primary source for 
analysis. The drug names and indications were submitted without controlled vocabulary. All synonyms, capitali-
zations, and misspellings were recognized and assigned to a single value. The same homogenization of terms was 
performed for other drugs of interest, adverse reactions, and indications.

minocycline. FAERS patients who took any drugs for the indication of depression were used as the control 
cohort. Negative values showing protective effect.

Data limitations. 
Due to the absence of a full set of medical records and the voluntary nature of the FAERS 
and AERS databases, the data in the study represents a subset of actual cases. Therefore, the frequencies and odds 
ratios of adverse events computed were not true absolute population frequencies. However, the combined set of 
records had provided sufficient statistical power for the analysis. Out of 8 million reports, 279,853 reports were 
used for analysis of ketamine in Fig. 1. Two cohorts for ketamine (K) patients and pain (P) patients with 41,337 
and 238,516 patients respectively.
