Abstract
Craving is considered a key characteristic of diverse pathologies, but evidence suggests it
may be a culture-bound construct. Almost 50% of American women crave chocolate specifi-
cally around the onset of menstruation. Research does not support popular accounts impli-
cating physiological factors in menstrual chocolate craving etiology. We tested the novel
hypothesis that greater menstrual craving prevalence in the U.S. is the product of internal-
ized cultural norms. Women of diverse backgrounds (n = 275) reported on craving fre-
quency and triggers and completed validated measures of acculturation. Foreign-born
women were significantly less likely to endorse menstrual chocolate craving (17.3%), com-
pared to women born to U.S.-born parents (32.7%, p = .03) and second generation immi-
grants (40.9%, p = .001). Second generation immigrant and foreign-born women endorsing
menstrual chocolate craving reported significantly greater U.S. acculturation and lower iden-
tification with their native culture than non-menstrual cravers (all p < .001). Findings inform
our understanding of food cravings, with important implications for the study of cravings in
other domains.
Introduction
Craving is now widely considered a key characteristic of diverse pathologies, including weight
and eating disorders, substance and non-substance addictions, impulse control and obsessive
compulsive disorders, and paraphilias [1–6]. The role of craving in relapse into addictive
behaviors has been widely documented [7–10]. Craving is also thought to play a role in food
addiction [11], and to act as a powerful trigger in the onset of binge eating episodes in patients
with bulimia nervosa and binge eating disorder, and a barrier to the successful achievement
and maintenance of weight loss [4,12,13]. The role of internal factors such as stress or negative
affect in the onset of craving episodes is generally recognized [14]. Research has also increas-
ingly acknowledged the importance of external context and situational cues in craving etiology
[15]. This study sought to expand upon our understanding of the importance of contextual
factors in the emergence of craving by examining the role of culture in a specific and well-doc-
umented instance of craving, namely cyclically occurring craving for chocolate.
Chocolate cravings are endorsed by over 90% of U.S. women [16]. In about half of these
female cravers, chocolate craving frequency and intensity markedly increase specifically
around the onset of menstruation [17]. This striking temporal pattern is the subject of ongoing

 speculation. Popular accounts regarding menstrual chocolate craving etiology implicate cycli-
cally fluctuating hormones or ingredients in chocolate thought to either alleviate premenstrual
nutritional deficits or remedy premenstrual symptoms via their pharmacological effects.
Remarkably, in spite of continuing resistance against abandoning a largely biomedical view of
menstrual craving, empirical evidence has consistently failed to support these hypotheses
[18,19].
While general and menstrual chocolate cravings are common in the U.S., they are exceed-
ingly rare in other parts of the world. For example, a mere 6% of Egyptian women endorse
craving chocolate [20]. Only 28% of Spanish women experience menstrual cravings [16].
These geographic differences hint at a possible causal role of internalized cultural norms: in a
society that emphasizes the “thin ideal” of female beauty, women may view menstruation as a
socially sanctioned excuse to indulge in an otherwise “taboo” food, resulting in cyclic increases
in reported craving frequency [16]. This study sought to test the surprising, yet increasingly
compelling hypothesis that culture is causally implicated in menstrual chocolate craving etiol-
ogy by assessing 1. chocolate craving prevalence in women of diverse cultural backgrounds
and 2. associations between menstrual craving and U.S. acculturation.
Materials and methods
The Institutional Review Board at the University at Albany reviewed and approved all meth-
ods. Participants were informed of the nature and purpose of the research and consented prior
to completion of questionnaires.
Procedures and participants
Data were collected as part of a larger survey study examining types and frequency of food
cravings in individuals from diverse cultural backgrounds. Participants included in the present
analyses were undergraduate women (n = 275) who received research participation credit in
exchange for time spent in the laboratory. Recruitment materials specifically targeted individu-
als (a) born outside the U.S., (b) with parent(s) or primary guardian(s) born outside the U.S.,
(c) who primarily lived outside the U.S. until age 18 and/or (d) primarily spoke a language
other than English while growing up.
Measures
Participants completed a battery of self-report questionnaires while seated at individual com-
puter stations to ensure privacy. They were asked to provide information on age, height and
weight, birthplace, time spent in the U.S. and abroad, native language(s), and parents’ birth-
place and current residence.
Chocolate craving. Participants reported on the presence of “any” (“Have you ever expe-
rienced a craving for chocolate?”–rated “yes or “no”) and “regular” chocolate cravings (“Do
you crave chocolate regularly?”–rated “yes” or “no”), in a manner comparable to prior studies
of craving [14,21] (see S1 Appendix). If participants provided a positive response to “yes”/”no”
questions about temporal patterns (“If you experience any chocolate cravings, do you feel that
they occur at any specific point in time (i.e. time of year, month, day, etc.)?”) and perceived
triggers of chocolate cravings (“If you experience any chocolate cravings, do you feel that they
are caused by any particular triggers?”), they were asked to provide additional details in open-
ended questions (“If YES, please specify the time(s) at which chocolate cravings tend to occur.”
and “If YES, please explain what tends to trigger your chocolate cravings.”). Questions about
perceived patterns and triggers of cravings preceded other questions related to menstrual crav-
ing to avoid priming effects. Participants referencing menstruation as the perceived cause of

 temporal patterns or direct trigger of cravings in their narrative responses (e.g., “menstrua-
tion,” “menstrual cycle,” “hormones,” “that time of the month,” etc.) were categorized as
“menstrual cravers” based on consensus from both authors involved in coding the data.
Other food craving.
Participants completed the Food Craving Inventory (FCI), a well-val-
idated and widely used measure of specific food cravings [22]. The FCI quantifies the “fre-
quency” of cravings for 28 foods, along with the frequency of “giving in” to those cravings.
Ratings load on to four factors, quantifying cravings for “high fat foods” (Cronbach’s α = .76
for “frequency, .83 for “giving in”), “sweets” (Cronbach’s α = .86, .87), “carbohydrates/
starches” (Cronbach’s α = .80, .82), and “fast food fats” (Cronbach’s α = .80, .81).
Acculturation.
“Second generation immigrant” and “foreign-born” women completed
the 32-item Stephenson Multigroup Acculturation Scale (SMAS). We calculated indices of
“dominant” (DSI, 15 items, Cronbach’s α = .92, e.g., “I feel at home in the United States.”) ver-
sus “ethnic society immersion” (ESI, 17 items, Cronbach’s α = .80, e.g., “I like to listen to
music of my ethnic group.”) by averaging scores on SMAS items quantifying familiarity and
comfort with U.S. versus native language, culture, and cuisine [23] (please see S1 Appendix for
information on how SMAS subscale scores were calculated). Respondents also completed the
12-item “U.S.” and “native cultural competency” subscales of the Abbreviated Multidimen-
sional Acculturation Scale (AMAS, Cronbach’s α = .90, .89, respectively), a measure of cultural
identity, language, and competence [24] (e.g., “How well do you know popular American tele-
vision shows?” and “How well do you know political leaders from your native culture?”).
Statistical analyses.
All data analyses were conducted using SPSS version 24. Men
(n = 208) and native English speakers raised abroad (n = 52) were excluded from the analyses
presented here. The remaining respondents were categorized as “American” (n = 101, 36.7%,
born in the U.S., native English speaker), “second generation immigrant” (n = 93, 33.8%, born
in the U.S., grew up speaking foreign language or bilingual), or “foreign-born” (n = 81, 29.5%,
born outside the U.S., native language is not English). Please note that we use the term “Ameri-
can” to describe native English speakers with U.S.-born parents, but acknowledge that respon-
dents categorized as “second generation immigrant” or “foreign born” may also identify as
“American.” Groups (i.e., “American,” “second-generation immigrant,” and “foreign-born”)
were compared in a series of chi-square (for “yes/no” questions regarding the presence of crav-
ings) and uni- and multivariate (for those measures containing multiple subscales) analyses of
variance (ANOVAs), with “group” as the fixed factor and continuous ratings (i.e., age, BMI,
years lived in the U.S., and FCI, SMAS and AMAS subscale scores) as the dependent variables.
A priori power analyses indicated minimum sample sizes of 108 and 164 for adequate
power (�.80) to detect medium-sized effects in chi-square tests and multivariate analyses of
variance [25]. Due to missing data, the number of respondents included in each analysis ran-
ged from 145 to 173 for analyses including “second-generation immigrant” and “foreign-
born” women, and from 99 to 271 for analyses including all respondents. Unless otherwise
noted, multivariate main effects are reported in the text; descriptives and results from univari-
ate ANOVAs and MANOVA between-subjects effects are presented in Tables.
Results and discussion
Categorization of respondents as “American,” “second-generation immigrant,” and “foreign-
born” based on birthplace and native language was supported by significant multivariate main

grant” women scoring significantly higher on the SMAS DSI and AMAS “U.S. cultural com-
petency” subscales, and significantly lower on the SMAS ESI and AMAS “native cultural

tests of between-subjects effects). “Foreign-born” women reported significantly fewer years of
living in the U.S.; groups did not differ in age or body mass index (see Table 1 for descriptives
and results from univariate ANOVAs).
“Foreign-born” women represented a wide range of countries and cultures (Table 2). “Sec-
ond-generation immigrant” women reported speaking the following native languages growing
up: Spanish (n = 31), English (exclusively, or in addition to a non-English native language,
n = 18), Chinese (n = 7, Wenzhounese, Fuzhounese, Cantonese, or Mandarin), French or Hai-
tian Creole (n = 6), French (n = 4), Bengali, Farsi, Korean, Malayalam, Polish, Russian, and
Twi (n = 2 each), Bambara, German, Gujarati, Hebrew, Igbo, Italian, Patwa/ Patois, Punjabi,
Urdu, and Vietnamese (n = 1 each). “Foreign-born” women represented the following native
languages: Chinese (Cantonese or Mandarin, n = 30), Korean (n = 10), Spanish (n = 9), French
or Haitian Creole and Japanese (n = 5 each), Hindi (n = 3), English (exclusively, or in addition
to a non-English native language, n = 3), German and Twi/ Akan(n = 2 each), Arabic, Bangla/
Bengali, Bemba, Hungarian, Krio, Maori, Patois, Polish, Portuguese, Swedish, Tagalog, Triqui/
Trique and Turkish (n = 1 each).
There were no significant multivariate main effects of “group” on combined FCI “fre-
quency” [F (8, 482) = .98, Wilk’s λ = .97, p = .45, Z2
p = .02] or “giving in” subscale scores

 [F (8, 460) = 1.13, Wilk’s λ = .96, p = .34, Z2
p = .02]. “Foreign-born” women were significantly
less likely to have experienced any chocolate craving (Table 3), compared to “American”
(post-hoc p = .02) and “second generation immigrant” women (post-hoc p = .03). There were
no between-group differences in prevalence of “regular” chocolate cravings (Table 3).
A third of all respondents endorsed experiencing “menstrual” chocolate craving (30.9%,
n = 85), meaning that they perceived their chocolate cravings to coincide with a specific time
of the menstrual cycle or identified menstruation, premenstrual symptoms, ovulation, or other
aspects of the menstrual cycle as a direct trigger of chocolate cravings. “Foreign-born” women
were significantly less likely to link chocolate cravings to the menstrual cycle, compared to
“American” (post-hoc p = .03) and “second generation immigrant” women (post-hoc p = .002;
Table 3). Respondents craving chocolate non-menstrually indicated observing the following
temporal patterns or triggers of their chocolate craving episodes (overlapping responses, i.e.,
respondents often indicated more than one pattern or trigger): when in a specific mood state
(n = 17, e.g., “down,” “stressed,” “blue” or “upset”), at a specific time of day (n = 12, predomi-
nantly in the afternoons or evenings), when studying (n = 8), during certain holidays (n = 4,
specifically Halloween, Valentine’s day, Easter, and Christmas), following meals (n = 3), when
thinking about chocolate (n = 2), while on vacation (n = 1), and when wanting to “satisfy my
sweet tooth” (n = 1).
In “second generation immigrant” and “foreign-born” respondents there were significant
multivariate main effects of “menstrual craving” on combined SMAS [F (2, 142) = 11.58,
Wilk’s λ = .86, p < .001, Z2
p = .14] and AMAS subscale scores [F (2, 166) = 10.00, Wilk’s λ = .89,
p < .001, Z2
p = .11], with menstrual cravers scoring significantly higher on the DSI [M = 3.59,
SD = .38 vs. M = 3.08, SD = .66; F (1, 143) = 23.26, p < .001, Z2
p = .14, 95% C.I.: -.72, -.30] and
“U.S. cultural competency” subscales [M = 3.32, SD = .52 vs. M = 2.89, SD = .63; F (1, 167) =
17.87, p < .001, Z2
p = .10, 95% C.I.: -.63, -.23], and significantly lower on “native cultural com-
petency” [M = 2.43, SD = .66 vs. M = 2.71, SD = .75; F (1, 167) = 5.36, p = .02, Z2
p = .03, 95% C.
I.: .04, .52].
Taken together, our data thus suggest no significant differences between the three groups in
the prevalence of non-chocolate food cravings or “regular” cravings for chocolate. Menstrual
craving, on the other hand, was least prevalent in “foreign-born” women, and associated with
greater levels of U.S. acculturation and lower native cultural competency. Results thus provide
compelling support for the view of menstrual chocolate craving as a potentially culture-bound
syndrome. Findings support our hypothesis that exposure to U.S. culture and the “thin ideal”
of female beauty create the perception that desires for seemingly “taboo” foods like chocolate
must be justified with socially acceptable excuses like menstruation or premenstrual syndrome
(PMS). It has been speculated that similar cultural norms about craving and food intake in
pregnancy may put American women at especially high risk for excess gestational weight gain
[26].
Our findings are consistent with prior research suggesting that premenstrual syndrome or
“PMS” is socially constructed [27] and Western culture-specific [28]. Recent research also

 finds that risk of premenstrual dysphoric disorder (PMDD) in ethnic minority women in the
U.S. is a direct function of exposure to American culture and increases with increasing amount
of time spent residing in the U.S. [29]. Interestingly, our measures did not specifically quantify
dietary acculturation. The perceived association between the menstrual cycle and chocolate
craving thus appears to be transmitted largely implicitly, via broad exposure to U.S. media, his-
tory, and politics. More research is needed to examine the hypothesis that menstrual craving is
the product of internalized norms about standards of female beauty, “forbidden” foods, and
socially sanctioned cues that signal permission to indulge.
There are several limitations to the research that must be noted. First, “second-generation”
and “foreign-born” respondents were not a homogeneous group, but represented individuals
from various cultures. Given our focus on examining differences between groups with varying
levels of U.S. acculturation, collapsing these respondents into two groups is justifiable; how-
ever, future research should examine the extent to which findings may differ if looking sepa-
rately at individuals from different regions of the world with varying degrees of cultural
similarities and differences, compared to the U.S. and North America. We did not collect
information on frequency of consumption or liking of chocolate. Women also did not indicate
information on regularity of their menstrual cycle or use of hormonal or other forms of con-
traception. Given that menstrual chocolate craving has been shown to be unrelated to levels of
ovarian hormones involved in regulating the menstrual cycle, these factors are however rela-
tively unlikely to have influenced our findings [19,21,30].
Another important limitation is our focus on one very specific example of craving, namely
chocolate craving and its perceived association with the menstrual cycle. We focused on this
example because the phenomenon of menstrual chocolate craving has been explored somewhat
more thoroughly in the published literature, compared to other types and targets of craving, in
particular in regards to the role of cultural context in craving etiology [16,18–20,31]. Of note,
there is evidence to suggest that a perceived link between menstruation and craving in women
may extend to other substances. For example, research on nicotine addiction suggests a possible
effect of hormonal fluctuations on abstinence-related symptoms, with studies finding evidence
for a heightened experience of withdrawal and increased cue-induced craving during the luteal
and ovulatory phases of the menstrual cycle [32,33]. Similarly, alcohol-dependent women report
increased frequency of drinking during the premenstrum, and they specifically identify this
time of the menstrual cycle as a drinking cue [34]. More research is needed to explore the extent
to which findings presented here generalize to our understanding of cravings in other domains.
Conclusions
In sum, we present evidence for a role of acculturation in the experience of menstrual choco-
late craving. In the absence of significant between-group differences in overall chocolate and
other food craving prevalence, these results suggest that exposure to U.S. culture increases the
likelihood that menstruation is identified as a perceived trigger or cause of chocolate cravings,
perhaps in an effort to justify consumption of an otherwise “forbidden” food. Findings have
several important implications. They inform our understanding of diet-related health in immi-
grants to the U.S., who are initially at relatively lower risk of overweight (the “healthy migrant
effect”) [35], an advantage that dissipates as a function of decreased consumption of ethnic
foods [36]. Menstrual craving has been linked to higher body mass and elevated eating disor-
der symptomology [37], suggesting that it may be another potentially preventable negative
consequence of dietary acculturation specifically in women.
Importantly, our findings also add to growing evidence suggesting that the craving con-
struct, or at least certain elements of the craving experience, may be uniquely meaningful in

 North America. For example, most languages outside of English lack a fully equivalent transla-
tion of the term “craving” [38]. It is increasingly recognized that sociocultural factors can dra-
matically alter the course and outcomes of disorders traditionally attributed solely to biological
abnormalities (e.g., schizophrenia) [39]. Future research should examine the impact of accul-
turation on the experience and manifestation of conditions characterized by recurrent crav-
ings, including addictions, eating and weight disorders, paraphilias, and impulse control and
obsessive-compulsive disorders.
