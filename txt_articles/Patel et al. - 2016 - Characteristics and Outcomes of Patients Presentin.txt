IMPORTANCE The prevalence and short-term outcomes of hypertensive urgency (systolic
blood pressure �180 mm Hg and/or diastolic blood pressure �110 mm Hg) are unknown.
Guidelines recommend achieving blood pressure control within 24 to 48 hours. However,
some patients are referred to the emergency department (ED) or directly admitted to the
hospital, and whether hospital management is associated with better outcomes is unknown.
OBJECTIVES To describe the prevalence of hypertensive urgency and the characteristics and
short-term outcomes of these patients, and to determine whether referral to the hospital is
associated with better outcomes than outpatient management.
DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS This retrospective cohort study with propensity
matching included all patients presenting with hypertensive urgency to an office in the
Cleveland Clinic Healthcare system from January 1, 2008, to December 31, 2013. Pregnant
women and patients referred to the hospital for symptoms or treatment of other conditions
were excluded. Final follow-up was completed on June 30, 2014, and data were assessed
from October 31, 2014, to May 31, 2015.
EXPOSURES Hospital vs ambulatory blood pressure management.
MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES Major adverse cardiovascular events (MACE) consisting of
acute coronary syndrome and stroke or transient ischemic attack, uncontrolled hypertension
(�140/90 mm Hg), and hospital admissions.
RESULTS Of 2 199 019 unique patient office visits, 59 836 (4.6%) met the definition of
hypertensive urgency. After excluding 851 patients, 58 535 were included. Mean (SD) age was
63.1 (15.4) years; 57.7% were women; and 76.0% were white. Mean (SD) body mass index
(calculated as weight in kilograms divided by height in meters squared) was 31.1 (7.6); mean
(SD) systolic blood pressure, 182.5 (16.6) mm Hg; and mean (SD) diastolic blood pressure,
96.4 (15.8) mm Hg. In the propensity-matched analysis, the 852 patients sent home were
compared with the 426 patients referred to the hospital, with no significant difference in
MACE at 7 days (0 vs 2 [0.5%]; P = .11), 8 to 30 days (0 vs 2 [0.5%]; P = .11), or 6 months
(8 [0.9%] vs 4 [0.9%]; P > .99). Patients sent home were more likely to have uncontrolled
hypertension at 1 month (735 of 852 [86.3%] vs 349 of 426 [81.9%]; P = .04) but not at
6 months (393 of 608 [64.6%] vs 213 of 320 [66.6%]; P = .56). Patients sent home had
lower hospital admission rates at 7 days (40 [4.7%] vs 35 [8.2%]; P = .01) and at 8 to 30 days
(59 [6.9%] vs 48 [11.3%]; P = .009).
CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE Hypertensive urgency is common, but the rate of MACE in
asymptomatic patients is very low. Visits to the ED were associated with more
hospitalizations, but not improved outcomes. Most patients still had uncontrolled
hypertension 6 months later.

A
pproximately one-third of the US population has
hypertension, which is associated with an increased
risk for end-organ damage, mainly myocardial
infarction, heart failure, stroke, and kidney damage.1-4 For
chronic uncontrolled hypertension, every 20–mm Hg
increase in systolic blood pressure (SBP) or 10–mm Hg
increase in diastolic blood pressure (DPB) is associated with
doubling of vascular mortality.5 Because organ damage
results from increased blood pressure over time, physicians
may be concerned about the potential for end-organ dam-
age after severely elevated blood pressure, even for short
periods. Hypertensive urgency is defined as SBP of at least
180 mm Hg and/or DBP of at least 110 mm Hg, without asso-
ciated end-organ damage.6-8 The prevalence of hyperten-
sive urgency in the outpatient setting is unknown, and
management is complicated by a lack of observational stud-
ies or randomized clinical trials. The seventh report of the
Joint National Committee on Prevention, Detection, Evalua-
tion, and Treatment of High Blood Pressure recommended
gradual blood pressure control for 24 to 48 hours,4 but this
was not addressed in the eighth report.9
Many patients with hypertensive urgency undergo evalu-
ation and treatment in the emergency department (ED), where
asymptomatic severe hypertension accounts for as many as
27% of medical emergencies10 and 3% of all visits.10,11 A re-
cent American College of Emergency Physicians policy state-
ment on this topic acknowledges the dearth of evidence sup-
porting recommendations for optimal follow-up, checking for
target organ damage, and the effectiveness of ED treatment.12
In practice, when patients present to outpatient clinics with
severely elevated blood pressure, some are directly admitted
to the hospital, some are sent to the ED, and others are sent
home with adjustments to antihypertensive therapy. To our
knowledge, no retrospective or prospective studies exist to in-
form management.
To address these concerns, we conducted a retrospec-
tive cohort study of all patients presenting with hyperten-
sive urgency in an office setting within a single health care
system during a 6-year period. We hypothesized that ambu-
latory patients with hypertensive urgency would have low
rates of cardiovascular events in the short term and that
referral to the hospital would not improve outcomes.
Methods
We conducted a retrospective cohort study of all patients pre-
senting with hypertensive urgency to an outpatient office
within the Cleveland Clinic Healthcare System from January
1, 2008, to December 31, 2013. The Cleveland Clinic Health-
careSystemincludesoutpatientpracticesinallspecialties,con-
sisting of 1 large academic health care center, 10 regional hos-
pitals, 17 family health centers, and more than 75 outpatient
locations in northeast Ohio and Florida. This study was ap-
provedbytheinstitutionalreviewboardoftheClevelandClinic
Healthcare System. Owing to the retrospective nature of the
study, informed consent was waived by the institutional
review board.
We defined hypertensive urgency as SBP of at least 180
mm Hg and/or DBP of at least 110 mm Hg.4 We excluded preg-
nant women and patients referred to the hospital for symp-
toms or for treatment of conditions other than hypertension.
Patients were divided between those sent home from the of-
fice and those referred to the hospital (ED or direct inpatient
admission) on the same day. To estimate the prevalence, we
divided the number of visits for hypertensive urgency by the
total number of unique patient visits to outpatient offices of
the Cleveland Clinic Healthcare System during the study
period. For patients with multiple visits with hypertensive
urgency, only the first visit was included.
Baseline Characteristics
For each patient, we recorded baseline demographic data, in-
cluding age, sex, race, blood pressure, and body mass index
(calculated as weight in kilograms divided by height in me-
ters squared). We recorded history of atherosclerotic risk fac-
tors, including hypertension, diabetes, smoking, coronary ar-
tery disease, hyperlipidemia, chronic kidney disease, dialysis,
and cerebrovascular events, based on encounter diagnosis
codes before the index visit. We also recorded antihyperten-
sives used at the index visit. Data were generated electroni-
cally and validated with 100% accuracy through manual medi-
cal record review.
End Point
All patients were followed up for 6 months and all blood
pressure readings were recorded. Patients were considered
to have uncontrolled hypertension at 1 month or 6 months if
the last blood pressure reading in that period was at least
140/90 mm Hg.1,13 We reviewed all subsequent visits in our
health care system and recorded major adverse cardiovascu-
lar events (MACE) within 7 days, 1 month, and 6 months of
the index visit. MACE included acute coronary syndrome
and cerebrovascular events. All outcomes were identified
electronically via codes from the International Classification
of Diseases, Ninth Revision, and then manually adjudicated
through medical record review by 2 independent reviewers
(K.K.P. and L.Y.). Acute coronary syndromes (ST and non-ST
elevation myocardial infarction and unstable angina) had to
have been diagnosed in the medical record by the consulting
Key Points
Question For ambulatory patients presenting with hypertensive
urgency, is referral to the hospital safer than routine outpatient
management of blood pressure?
Findings In this retrospective study of 58 535 patients,
emergency department visits for hypertensive urgency were
associated with an 8.2% rate of hospital admissions at 7 days vs
4.7% for patients sent home, a significant difference. Major cardiac
events were rare, and two-thirds of patients still had uncontrolled
hypertension at 6 months.
Meaning For patients presenting with asymptomatic
hypertensive urgency, efforts should focus on improving follow-up
and serial blood pressure control instead of referral to the hospital.

cardiologist. Similarly, cerebrovascular events (ischemic and
hemorrhagic strokes or transient ischemic attacks with
attributable territory of origin) had to have been diagnosed
by a consulting neurologist. On review, fewer than 10% of
the codes represented a new event. We also recorded all-
cause hospital admission rates, including ED, observation,
and inpatient admissions within 7 days of the baseline visit
and from 8 to 30 days (1 month) after to assess for changes in
the use of health care resources between the 2 treatment
groups. Patients who did not have a subsequent blood pres-
sure reading were considered lost to or unavailable for
follow-up and were not included in the analysis of blood
pressure control. For patients who were referred to the ED
solely for treatment of blood pressure, details of manage-
ment, including tests and results, were recorded by manual
medical record review. Target organ damage was identified
by test results.
Statistical Analysis
Patient characteristics were summarized with descriptive sta-
tistics. Continuous variables were compared using the un-
paired t test and categorical variables were compared using the
χ2 test. We created a propensity model with referral to the ED
or hospital as the outcome. The model included baseline de-
mographics (age, sex, and race), SBP and DBP values, vascu-
lar disease risk factors (hypertension, diabetes, hyperlipid-
emia, stroke or transient ischemic attack, chronic kidney
disease, dialysis, and coronary artery disease), and number of
antihypertensives used at baseline. Asymptomatic patients re-
ferred to the ED or hospital were then matched with patients
sent home in a 1:2 ratio using the propensity-matching algo-
rithm in R software.14 We compared outcomes between pa-
tients referred to the ED or hospital and propensity-matched
control individuals using Pearson χ2 test or Fisher exact test
if the events were rare.15-17 Baseline characteristics of pa-
tients lost to or unavailable for follow-up were compared with
thoseofpatientswhohadfollow-up.Wethenperformedasen-
sitivityanalysisinwhichwelimitedthedatasettopatientswho

ited the analysis to those patients who had a blood pressure
reading within 6 months. We also performed stratified analy-
ses limited to patients with SBPs of at least 200 and at least
220 mm Hg. All analyses were conducted with R studio soft-
ware (https://www.r-project.org/). Statistical significance was
established at a 2-sided P < .05.
Results
During the study period, 1 299 019 unique patient office vis-
its occurred during which a blood pressure reading was re-
corded, and 59 836 of these (4.6%) met the definition for hy-
pertensiveurgency.Afterexcluding851patients(eFigureinthe
Supplement), our final sample included 58 535 patients. Char-
acteristics of the population appear in Table 1. Patients had a
mean (SD) age of 63.1 (15.4) years; 57.7% were women; and
76.0% were white. The mean (SD) body mass index was 31.1
(7.6). The mean (SD) SBP was 182.5 (16.6) mm Hg, with 10.2%
of the patients having an SBP of at least 200 mm Hg. The mean
(SD) DBP was 96.4 (15.8) mm Hg with 5.7% of the patients hav-
ing a DBP of at least 120 mm Hg. We found a documented his-
tory of hypertension in 72.9% of patients, and 58.2% of pa-
tients were taking 2 or more antihypertensives.
Only 426 patients (0.7%) were referred to the hospital for
blood pressure management. The rest (n = 58 109) were sent
home.Themeanbloodpressureofpatientsreferredtothehos-
pital for management was 16/11 mm Hg higher than that of pa-
tients sent home (P < .001). Of the 426 patients who were re-
ferred to the hospital, 218 (51.2%) had an SBP of at least 200
mm Hg compared with 5745 (9.9%) of 58 109 patients sent
home (P < .001). The distribution of most atherosclerotic risk
factors was similar between groups, but patients sent to the
hospitalweremorelikelytohaveahistoryofhypertension(408
of 424 [96.2%] vs 42 264 of 57 916 [73.0%]; P < .001) and
chronic kidney disease (71 of 426 [16.7%] vs 6050 of 58 109
[10.4%]; P < .01). The number and type of antihypertensives
taken for both groups are shown in Table 1.
Table 2 shows the unadjusted outcomes for all patients.
Overall, the rate of MACE within 7 days, 8 to 30 days (1 month),
and 6 months was low (<1%) in both groups. A total of 496 pa-
tients experienced MACE within 6 months (205 episodes of
acute coronary syndrome and 301 episodes of stroke or tran-
sient ischemic attack). Regardless of where patients were
treated, the percentage of patients with controlled hyperten-
sion at 1 and 6 months was poor. In unadjusted analyses com-
pared with patients sent home, patients referred to the hos-
pital had more MACE at 7 days (2 of 426 [0.5%] vs 61 of 58 109
[0.1%]; P = .02) but no significant difference at 1 and 6 months.
They also had a higher 7-day (35 of 426 [8.2%] vs 2311 of 58 109
[4.0%]; P < .001) and 8- to 30-day (48 of 426 [11.3%] vs 3897
of 58 109 [6.7%]; P < .001) hospital admission rates.
Our propensity model had a C statistic of 0.83. For our pro-
pensity-matched analysis, we were able to match all 426 pa-
tients referred to the hospital in a 1:2 ratio with patients sent
home (Table 3). The baseline characteristics of the matched
groupsappearineTable1intheSupplement.Inthepropensity-
matched analysis, patients sent home (n = 852) compared with
patients referred to the hospital (n = 426) had no significant
difference in MACE at 7 days (0 vs 2 [0.5%]; P = .11]), 8 to 30
days (0 vs 2 [0.5%]; P = .11), or 6 months (8 [0.9%] vs 4 [0.9%];
P > .99). Patients sent home were more likely to have uncon-
trolled hypertension at 1 month (735 [86.3%] vs 349 [81.9%];
P = .04) but not at 6 months (393 of 608 [64.6%] vs 213 of 320
[66.6%]; P = .56). They also had lower hospital admission rates
at 7 days (40 [4.7%] vs 35 [8.2%]; P = .01) and 8 to 30 days (59
[6.9%] vs 48 [11.3%]; P = .009).
Loss to or unavailability for follow-up occurred in 58 of the
426 patients referred to the hospital (13.6%) and 12 553 of the
58 109 patients sent home (21.6%). Baseline characteristics of
patients with and without follow-up did not differ signifi-
cantly (eTable 2 in the Supplement). Limiting the analysis to
patients with follow-up at 6 months did not change the re-
sults (eTable 3 in the Supplement). Patients who had a pri-
mary care physician in the Cleveland Clinic Healthcare Sys-
tem (44.2% of our sample) were less likely to be lost to or
unavailable for follow-up, including 9 of 172 (5.2%) of those

referredtothehospitaland3036of22 648(13.4%)ofthosesent
home. Unadjusted and propensity-matched analyses of these
patients (eTable 3 in the Supplement) yielded essentially the
same results.
When we limited the analysis to patients with higher
blood pressure values, 218 of 5963 patients with SBP of at
least 200 mm Hg (3.7%) and 81 of 1058 patients with SBP of
at least 220 mm Hg (7.7%) at baseline were referred to the
hospital (eTables 4 to 7 in the Supplement). The referred
patients were younger, were more likely to be African Ameri-
can, and had higher blood pressure values and more comor-
bidities. As in the overall sample, patients referred to the
hospital had less uncontrolled hypertension at 1 month but
not at 6 months. MACE outcomes and hospital admission
rates did not differ significantly.
Of the 426 patients referred to the hospital, 387 were re-
ferred to the ED; the rest were directly admitted to an inpa-
tient unit. On arrival at the ED, mean (SD) SBP was 197.1 (27.8)
mm Hg and mean (SD) DBP was 103.1 (18.7) mm Hg. On dis-
charge, mean (SD) SBP had fallen to 166.3 (23.3) mm Hg and
DBP to 87.1 (15.4) mm Hg. Eight patients (1.9%) had evidence
of target organ damage (4 had pulmonary edema, 2 had acute
kidney injury, and 2 had elevated levels of cardiac biomark-
ers). The cause of hypertensive urgency was unknown in 233
patients (60.2%), attributed to nonadherence to therapy (in-
cluding running out of medications) in 94 (24.3%), new diag-
noses of hypertension in 42 (10.9%), and referral because they
were new patients who presented with elevated blood pres-
surereadingsin18(4.7%).Treatmentconsistedofa1-timedose

(with intravenous delivery in 91 and oral medication in 151),
whereas the rest received no intervention. Labetalol hydro-
chloride (42 [10.9%]) was the most commonly used intrave-
nous drug and clonidine (58 [15.0%]) was the most com-
monly used oral drug. In the ED, 41 of 748 tests ordered (5.5%)
and 39 of 387 patients (10.1%) had an abnormal result (Table 4).
Of the ED patients, 61 (15.8%) were admitted to an inpatient
service and 310 (80.1%) were discharged home. Of the 61 pa-
tients admitted from the ED, 9 (14.8%) were admitted for ob-
servation, and the mean (SD) length of stay was 3.5 (3.8) days.
Among the 310 patients discharged from the ED, a new anti-
hypertensive was added to the home regimen for 82 patients
(26.5%), the home dose of antihypertensive therapy was in-
creased for 23 (7.4%) (some patients had both), and no change
was made for 257 (82.9%).
Discussion
In this large retrospective cohort study, almost 1 in 20 pa-
tients presenting to the outpatient departments had hyper-
tensive urgency, but fewer than 1 in 100 asymptomatic pa-
tients were referred to the hospital or ED for management of
blood pressure. The rate of MACE in all patients was low.

Referral to the hospital was associated with increased hospi-
talizations,butnotwithbetteroutcomes.Disappointingly,most
patients with hypertensive urgency still had uncontrolled hy-
pertension 6 months later.
Despitethecommonnatureoftheproblem,asurprisinglack
of literature characterizes hypertensive urgency and its out-
comes,particularlyintheambulatorysetting.Priorstudies10,18,19
report the prevalence of hypertensive crisis in the ED to range
from0.5%to3%ofvisits,includingthoseforasymptomaticand
symptomaticurgencyandpatientswithemergentvisits.Incom-
parison, we found that hypertensive urgency was present in
nearly5%ofpatientsintheofficesetting,althoughfewwerere-
ferred to the hospital for management.
Little evidence guides the management of hypertensive
urgency. Other than treatment of symptoms, no recommen-
dations exist about who should receive acute management
in an emergency setting. What benefit patients get from
management in the ED is also unclear. We found that
patients who were referred for emergency treatment gener-
ally had higher blood pressure but were otherwise similar to
those treated in the outpatient setting. Testing results were
largely unrevealing. In our study, only 5.5% of tests had an
abnormal result and only 8 of 387 patients undergoing test-
ing (2.1%) had evidence of target organ injury. Karras et al20
and Nishijima et al21 reported similar rates of meaningful
test abnormalities (6% to 7.2%) in patients presenting to the
ED with asymptomatic severe hypertension. Moreover, most
of these tests could be performed without an ED admission.
Interestingly, 142 of our 379 ED patients (37.5%) received no
intervention for their blood pressure, 310 of 387 (80.1%)
were discharged home, and 257 of 310 (82.9%) did not have
a change in their antihypertensive regimen on discharge,
which is comparable to previous reports.20,22
Hypertensive urgency is a sign of poorly controlled
hypertension and is associated in the longer term with end-
organ damage, primarily of the heart, brain, and kidneys.3,5
In the office setting, however, very high blood pressure read-
ings may also be perceived as posing an immediate risk of
acute coronary syndrome or stroke, perhaps prompting hos-
pital referral. To date, however, no study has indicated that
hypertensive urgency portends acute risk. The few pub-
lished reports of outcomes in severe hypertension focus on a
select subset of symptomatic patients with acute end-organ
damage.23,24 These findings cannot be extrapolated to
asymptomatic patients presenting to the office or ED. In our
cohort, cardiovascular events occurred in less than 1% of
patients within 6 months. In our propensity-matched
sample, ED referral was not associated with better 7-day,
8- to 30-day, or 6-month cardiovascular outcomes. A larger
concern is long-term uncontrolled hypertension, which
poses a more serious risk to patients.3,5 In our cohort, 59.7%
of patients had uncontrolled hypertension at 6 months, and
no difference was found between the group sent to the hos-
pital and those sent home. Although less dramatic, uncon-
trolled hypertension in these patients is a more likely cause
of long-term cardiovascular morbidity and mortality. As
such, appropriate follow-up and intensification of antihyper-
tensive therapy should be emphasized.
Ourstudyhasseveralimportantlimitations.Thestudywas
conducted in a single health care system in Ohio and Florida
and may not be generalizable to other regions. However, our
system is large and includes a diverse population of more than
1 million patients seen in inner city, suburban, and rural set-
tings. Given our data source—medical record review—we may
not have ascertained all outcomes. Additional events could
have occurred in other health care systems and sudden car-
diac death at home may not have been captured. However,
unless such events were more likely to occur in patients sent
home, our findings would be unchanged. Death outside the
hospital is not reliably captured in our electronic health

record review, so we did not include mortality in our analy-
sis. Given that the major cardiac events were so rare and the
referral to the hospital was not associated with a significant
difference, mortality was unlikely to be significantly af-
fected. Given the observational nature, our study may be sub-
ject to confounding. We were able to successfully match all pa-
tients admitted to the hospital with 2 controls, thereby
balancing blood pressure, demographics, and important car-
diovascular risk factors, but unmeasured confounders may
nevertheless have contributed to the observed associations.
Last,manyofourpatientswerelosttoorunavailableforfollow-
up. More than 20% of our patients did not have another visit
within our health care system within 6 months. These pa-
tients in particular may have had important study outcomes
that we did not capture. Baseline characteristics of these pa-
tients did not differ significantly from those of patients who
didreturnwithin6months,buttheymayhavedifferedinways
we did not measure. Patients who had a primary care physi-
cian designated in the system had better rates of 6-month fol-
low-up (almost 90%), and a sensitivity analysis restricted to
these patients did not produce different results.
Our study also has several strengths. To the best of our
knowledge, ours is the first study to describe prevalence, char-
acteristics, and outcomes of ambulatory patients presenting
with hypertensive urgency across a large health care system.
It is also the first study to compare and quantify short-term
outcomes depending on the setting of management of hyper-
tensive urgency.
Conclusions
Hypertensive urgency is common in the outpatient setting. In
the absence of symptoms of target organ damage, most pa-
tients probably can be safely treated in the outpatient set-
ting,becausecardiovascularcomplicationsarerareintheshort
term. Furthermore, referral to the ED was associated with in-
creased use of health care resources but not better outcomes.
Finally, patients with hypertensive urgency are at high risk for
uncontrolled hypertension as long as 6 months after the ini-
tial episode. Efforts to improve follow-up and intensify anti-
hypertensive therapy should be pursued.

LESS IS MORE
Hypertensive Urgency—Is This a Useful Diagnosis?
Iona Heath, MB, BChir, FRCGP, FRCP
In this issue of JAMA Internal Medicine, Patel et al1 interro-
gate the entity known as hypertensive urgency by studying pa-
tients who presented within the Cleveland Clinic system with
severe hypertension but no symptoms. We are not told why
these patients sought medi-
cal attention. The authors’
very reasonable hypothesis is
that “ambulatory patients
with hypertensive urgency would have low rates of cardiovas-
cular events in the short term and that referral to the hospital
would not improve outcomes.”1 The study substantiates this
conjecture. Perhaps unsurprisingly, patients who felt well
turned out to be well, and experienced a very small number
of serious sequelae. Only 0.7% of the Cleveland Clinic pa-
tients were referred to hospital for blood pressure manage-
ment.These426patientstriggeredhigherhealthcarecostsbut
no difference in outcomes. They underwent 748 tests, only 41
(5.5%) of which had abnormal results. All 60 computed tomo-
graphic scans ordered (49 of the head and 11 of the chest) had
normal findings. These evaluations must represent unneces-
sary exposure to radiation and potential harm to patients.
So, with the term hypertensive urgency, we seem to have
a condition, defined by a raised blood-pressure reading, that
causes an enormous amount of anxiety to patients and clini-
cians alike but that does not require hospital admission and
has a good prognosis. Malignant hypertension used to be a rare
diagnosis with a poor prognosis; now we are told that hyper-
tensive urgency occurs in 4.6% of all office visits in an Ameri-
can health care system, while its implications seem much less
serious. It is time that we acknowledged that disease in the ab-
sence of symptoms may be a very different phenomenon from
symptomatic disease, or as Hoffman and Cooper2(p1124) put it,
“we must recognize the enormous difference between a dis-
easethatpresentsclinicallyand‘
thesame’diseasethatisfound
only because we have decided to search for it, in the absence
of compelling clinical concern.” It seems likely that this enor-
mous difference is driving much diagnostic drift and overdi-
agnosis, compounded by the perverse incentives of pay-for-
performance systems.
Someconfirmationofthelatterisprovidedbyastudy3that
reported national trends in hospital admissions for various hy-
pertension diagnoses. The main findings were of substantial
rises in the number of admissions for both malignant hyper-
tension and hypertensive encephalopathy after 2007, whereas
discharges for essential hypertension fell, and there was no
change for the combination of the 3 diagnoses. The implica-
tion is that patients who would previously have been labeled
as having essential hypertension were being diagnosed with
malignant hypertension or hypertensive encephalopathy. The
increased seriousness of the diagnoses was not correlated with
the levels of morbidity that might have been expected and, al-
though health care costs rose, length of stay fell, and mortal-
ity for malignant hypertension fell markedly. The conclusion
was that these findings were not real changes in the severity
of disease but changes dictated by pressures to code accord-
ing to severity in order to be remunerated. Such bureaucratic
procedures drive overdiagnosis with no understanding of the
additional burden of fear imposed on both patients and clini-
cians as a direct result.
As a biometric variable that changes all the time in re-
sponse to experience and emotion, BP is a conundrum. It is
never static, so a single isolated reading can be very mislead-
ing, especially if the patient is frightened, unwell, or stressed.
Hypertension in itself is not a disease but a risk factor for other
diseases. It has been studied for decades, and yet there seems
to be a fundamental confusion within the current classifica-
tion. The most serious category is a hypertensive emergency,
when symptoms and signs suggestive of encephalopathy are
combined with very high BP readings. This situation always
requires hospital admission. Much more common is chroni-
callyraisedBPwithreadingspersistentlyraisedreadingsabove
160/100 mm Hg4; this is undoubtedly a significant risk factor
for diseases such as coronary heart disease or stroke. Reduc-
ing these levels of BP through lifestyle modification or medi-
cation lowers the risk and benefits patients. A third interme-
diate category is hypertensive urgency. In the absence of
symptoms, this turns out to be largely illusory and no more
serious than a single isolated reading of high BP. Neverthe-
less, people are being admitted to hospital and treated with
powerful medications, incurring unwarranted costs, and caus-
ing harm to patients in terms of needless fear, stress, and the
adverse effects of medication.
Morethan80%ofthepatientsintheClevelandClinicstudy
had BP above the stated target of 140/90 mm Hg 1 month af-
ter the diagnosis of hypertensive urgency and more than 60%,
6 months afterwards. Yet more than one-half of these pa-
tients were already taking 2 or more antihypertensives and
more than one-third were taking 3 or more. Every frontline cli-
nicianiswellawarehowdifficulttheseBPtargetsaretoachieve,
