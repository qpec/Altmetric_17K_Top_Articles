Abstract
Background: In December 2016, the Surgeon General published a report that concluded e-cigarette use among
youth and young adults is becoming a major public health concern in the United States of America.
Methods: Re-analysis of key data sources on nicotine toxicity and prevalence of youth use of e-cigarettes cited in
the Surgeon General report as the basis for its conclusions.
Results: Multiple years of nationally representative surveys indicate the majority of e-cigarette use among US youth
is either infrequent or experimental, and negligible among never-smoking youth. The majority of the very small
proportion of US youth who use e-cigarettes on a regular basis, consume nicotine-free products. The sharpest
declines in US youth smoking rates have occurred as e-cigarettes have become increasingly available. Most of the
evidence presented in the Surgeon General’s discussion of nicotine harm is not applicable to e-cigarette use,
because it relies almost exclusively on exposure to nicotine in the cigarette smoke and not to nicotine present in e-
cigarette aerosol emissions. Moreover, the referenced literature describes effects in adults, not youth, and in animal
models that have little relevance to real-world e-cigarette use by youth. The Surgeon General’s report is an
excellent reference document for the adverse outcomes due to nicotine in combination with several other
toxicants present in tobacco smoke, but fails to address the risks of nicotine decoupled from tobacco smoke
constituents. The report exaggerates the toxicity of propylene glycol (PG) and vegetable glycerin (VG) by focusing
on experimental conditions that do not reflect use in the real-world and provides little discussion of emerging
evidence that e-cigarettes may significantly reduce harm to smokers who have completely switched.
Conclusions: The U.S. Surgeon General’s claim that e-cigarette use among U.S. youth and young adults is an
emerging public health concern does not appear to be supported by the best available evidence on the health
risks of nicotine use and population survey data on prevalence of frequent e-cigarette use. Nonetheless, patterns of
e-cigarettes use in youth must be constantly monitored for early detection of significant changes. The next US
Surgeon General should consider the possibility that future generations of young Americans will be less likely to
start smoking tobacco because of, not in spite of, the availability of e-cigarettes.

 Background
As ‘America’s doctor,’ the US Surgeon General on the
Public Health Service is the most authoritative voice on
matters of public health, preventive medicine, and health
promotion in the United States of America. A core re-
sponsibility of the Surgeon General is to communicate
the best available scientific information to the public re-
garding ways to improve personal and public health. The
landmark 1964 report of the Surgeon General on the ad-
verse health consequences of tobacco smoking [1], for
example, heightened global awareness about the harms
of smoking and inspired public health and legislative ini-
tiatives to reduce the burden of tobacco use on individ-
uals who smoke, their families, and wider society.
Subsequent Surgeon General’s reports have expanded
our understanding of the health consequences from ac-
tive and passive smoking across an expanding list of dis-
eases and organ systems [2, 3]. The Surgeon General’s
reports have been instrumental in communicating to
both smokers and healthcare professionals that quitting
smoking fully and at the soonest opportunity is the best
action a smoker can take to improve his or her health in
the short- to long-term, and consequently, steady pro-
gress in curtailing the rate of smoking-related morbidity
and mortality in the USA has typically followed the pub-
lication of these reports.
On 8 December 2016, now former US Surgeon Gen-
eral, Vivek M. Murthy published his first report on e-
cigarette use among youth and young adults in the USA
[4]. Based on a review of data on the patterns, percep-
tions, correlates, and health effects of e-cigarette use
among youth and young adults in the USA, the Surgeon
General concluded that exposure to nicotine and other
chemicals through e-cigarettes pose serious health risks
to young people (chapter 3), and that e-cigarettes are be-
ing used by a rapidly increasing proportion of youth and
young people in the USA (chapter 2). As such, the Sur-
geon General states in the report’s preface that “e-
cigarette use among U.S. youth and young adults is now
a major public health concern.”
Obviously, efforts should be made to deter use of e-
cigarettes by unintended (from a public health perspec-
tive) population subgroups, specifically non-smokers and
youth. However, since e-cigarettes could be part of a
broader strategy for reducing tobacco-related harm in
the population, policy decisions that would change the
availability and attractiveness of e-cigarettes should
weigh the likely protective and harmful effects of e-
cigarette use by different population groups. In this
paper, we present data that show e-cigarette use to be
substantially less harmful and less frequent among
young people in the USA than the Surgeon General sug-
gests. In particular, we examine data that were available
to, but not included or minimally discussed by, the
Surgeon General, that suggest the risks of long-term in-
halation of e-cigarette vapor is likely to carry a fraction
of the risk associated with long-term inhalation of
cigarette smoke, and that majority of e-cigarette use
among US youth is infrequent and experimental, min-
imal among never-smoking youth, and does not actually
involve nicotine use. Together, we argue that these data
do not support the claim that e-cigarette use among US
youth is of substantial public health concern, and instead
argue e-cigarettes may represent a significant opportun-
ity to accelerate the USA’ progress towards its first gen-
eration of smoke-free Americans.
Critique of chapter 2: patterns of e-cigarette use
among US youth and young adults
Foreword
Chapter 2 of the Surgeon General’s report describes pat-
terns of e-cigarette use among youth (12–17 years) and
young adults (18–24 years). The report makes repeated
statements about ‘the number of young people who use
e-cigarettes’; for example, “E-cigarette use has increased
considerably in recent years, growing an astounding
900% among high school students from 2011 to 2015”
(p. 7). This statement is true when ‘use’ is measured as
the proportion of young people who have ever tried
using an e-cigarette, even once, in their lifetime. How-
ever, one-time or experimental use of an e-cigarette is
extremely unlikely to increase any individual’s risk for
developing any disease known to be caused by smoking.
Rather, pre- and post-market population models of the
public health impact of e-cigarette use are more mean-
ingfully informed by data on the prevalence of three
characteristics of e-cigarette use that were afforded only
limited discussion by the Surgeon General: frequency of
e-cigarette use, the nicotine concentration of e-cigarettes
used, and the smoking status of the e-cigarette user.
Ever-use vs. frequent use
The Surgeon General’s report draws heavily from the
National Youth Tobacco Survey (NYTS) and the Moni-
toring the Future Study (MTF) [5–8], two nationally rep-
resentative surveys of US youth. Despite being reported
by these surveys, the Surgeon General’s report provides
little discussion of the rate of frequent e-cigarette use,
defined as use on at least 20 of the past 30 days, among
US youth. Measures of e-cigarette use, which do not
capture frequency, intensity, or reasons for use, are
largely uninformative and provide misleading conclu-
sions about the individual as well as public health impact
of e-vapor products [9].
While these surveys do indeed show youth rates of
ever-use of an e-cigarette have increased by several hun-
dred per-cent in recent years, they also show youth rates
of frequent use of an e-cigarette, which is more strongly

 indicative of a behavior likely to be sustained, and so,
more strongly associated with health outcomes, have
remained very low between 2011 and 2015. Data from
the 2015 NYTS, for example, reveal that, among middle
school students, 13.5% have ever used an e-cigarette (i.e.,
ever-users) and 5.3% have used an e-cigarette at least
once in the past 30 days, but only 0.6% have used an e-
cigarette on at least 20 of the past 30 days (i.e., frequent
users) [4] (p. 29). Among high school students, the re-
spective rates were 37.7, 16.0, and 2.5% [4] (p. 30). Simi-
lar patterns have been observed among young adults
too, with the 2013–2014 National Adult Tobacco Survey
finding rates of ever-use, current use, and frequent use
among those aged 18–24 years to be 35.8, 13.6, and
2.0%, respectively [4] (p. 38). The 2014 MTF survey, too,
revealed that although past 30-day e-cigarette use was
reported by 17.2% of 12th graders, only 6.6% had used
e-cigarettes for > 5 days in the past month [10].
Frequent e-cigarette use according to smoking status
The 2014 MTF survey showed that frequent e-cigarette
use was extremely rare among never-smoking youth:
only 1.7 and 0.7% of never smokers were using e-
cigarettes for > 5 days and 20–30 days of the past
month, respectively [7]. In contrast, 14.7% of current
regular smokers and 15.0% of youth who smoked regu-
larly in the past were currently using an e-cigarette fre-
quently. A secondary analysis of the 2014 NYTS data
showed that 87% of past 30-day e-cigarette users had
ever used a tobacco product while 63% reported using a
tobacco product in the past 30 days [11]. However, less
than 0.1% of never-users of tobacco had used e-
cigarettes for > 10 days of the past month [11]. Similarly
very low rates of frequent e-cigarette use among never-
smoking US youth have also been observed among
youth in several other countries [12, 13]. For example,
although approximately 12% of adolescents in the UK
reported ever-use of e-cigarettes, only 0.7–1% reported
use of an e-cigarette more than once weekly, with most
being smokers [14, 15].
Nicotine-containing e-cigarette use
Next, the Surgeon General states that “…most e-
cigarettes contain nicotine, which can cause addiction
and can harm the developing adolescent brain.” [1] (p.
7). Consumption of nicotine via e-cigarette aerosol is an
important determinant of an individual’s risk for de-
pendence on e-cigarettes and progression to frequent
use or transition to smoking tobacco cigarettes. How-
ever, while most e-cigarettes may indeed contain nico-
tine, data suggest the majority of ever-user US youth use
e-cigarettes that do not contain nicotine. Miech et al. re-
cently reported data from the 2015 MTF survey showing
that 65–66% of e-cigarette ever-user students in the 8th,
10th, and 12th grade had, at last use, used an e-cigarette
that did not contain nicotine (i.e., only contained flavor-
ings); only 13–22% of ever-user students were using
nicotine-containing e-cigarettes [16]. For current e-
cigarette users, 59–63% reported using e-cigarettes con-
taining ‘just flavorings’ at last use. Similar findings have
been observed in Canada, where 70% of high school e-
cigarette ever-users had never used an e-cigarette that
contained nicotine [17]. Thus, the rate of nicotine-
containing e-cigarette use appears to be a small propor-
tion of overall e-cigarette use in this population.
Rate of youth e-cigarette use over time
The alarm raised by the Surgeon General comes at a
time when prevalence of ever-use of an e-cigarette
among US youth appears to be stabilizing, even declin-
ing. The MTF survey found no change in prevalence of
past 30-day use between 2014 and 2015, despite the fact
that, in 2015, the survey questions were broadened to
say “electronic vaporizers such as e-cigarettes” instead of
just “e-cigarettes”. While the 2015 NYTS reported an in-
crease in past 30-day use from 2014 (9.3%) to 2015
(11.3%) the rate of increase has significantly declined
compared to the change from 2013 (3.1%) to 2014. Re-
cently, data from the 2016 MTF survey [18] revealed a
substantial decline in e-cigarette use compared to 2015.
Specifically, the 2016 prevalence of past 30-day use was
6.2% in 8th graders (from 9.5% in 2015), 11.0% in 10th
graders (from 14% in 2015), and 12.5% in 12th graders
(from 16.0% in 2015). Similar to 2015, the majority of
adolescents were using e-cigarettes that did not nicotine.
Youth e-cigarette use and smoking rates
The greatest public health concern about e-cigarettes,
however, is not the rate at which youth are currently
using e-cigarettes, but the rate at which youth use of e-
cigarettes may increase rates of youth use of more harm-
ful tobacco products (e.g., starting to smoke cigarettes).
Setting aside momentarily the evidence that the vast ma-
jority of youth e-cigarette use in the USA is found
among youth who are already smoking, the rate at which
non-smoking youth who use e-cigarettes may become
smokers as a consequence of having used e-cigarettes is
a legitimate concern and a pressing public health policy
question.
Broadly, there are two trajectories in which a youth’s
likelihood of initiating smoking varies as a function of
his/her e-cigarette use, and two trajectories in which the
likelihood of initiating smoking occurs independently of
e-cigarette use. In the worst-case scenario for public
health, e-cigarette use may (for example, by habituating
a young non-smoker to the effects of nicotine and the
sights, smell, and feel of inhaling and exhaling a visible
vapor) increase interest in smoking cigarettes among
Polosa et al. Harm Reduction Journal  (2017) 14:61 
Page 3 of 10
 youths who were unlikely to have started smoking had
they not started using e-cigarettes first (i.e., a putative
causal effect), resulting in net harm to the youth popula-
tion. In the best-case scenario for public health, use of
an e-cigarette (particularly those that do not physically
resemble a conventional cigarette and those containing
flavors that are not available through conventional ciga-
rettes) may provide a sufficiently pleasurable experience
that discourages initiation of cigarette smoking among
youth who were more likely to have started smoking cig-
arettes had they not started using e-cigarettes first (i.e., a
putative protective effect), resulting in net avoided harm
to the youth population. Then there are two trajectories
in which cigarette smoking and e-cigarette use are unre-
lated: youth who are likely to start smoking even if they
do not start using e-cigarettes, and youth who are un-
likely to start smoking even if they do start using e-
cigarettes. Studies that report data on the prevalence of
these four mutually exclusive relationships between e-
cigarette use and smoking initiation will provide a good
basis for estimating the net health impact of e-cigarettes
on US youth. Thus, while the low rates of current use
and frequent use of an e-cigarette use among US youth
revealed by multi-year cross-sectional surveys do not de-
pict e-cigarette use among US youth as a major public
health concern at present, monitoring for evidence of an
increased use of e-cigarettes by non-smoking youth, and
an increased rate of smoking initiation among the small
proportion of non-smoking youth who use e-cigarettes
is essential.
Determining the rates at which e-cigarette use pre-
vents, causes, and coincides with smoking initiation
among youth requires longitudinal studies to follow
young people over time, ideally over several years, to ad-
equately characterize the rates of youth smoking initi-
ation associated with prior regular, experimental, one-
time, and no use of an e-cigarette. These studies should
ideally also seek to identify the combinations of e-
cigarette device formats, flavors, nicotine strengths, and
use settings most strongly associated with youths’ in-
creased and reduced odds for future smoking initiation.
Five longitudinal studies cited in the Surgeon General
report claimed that e-cigarette use at baseline predicted
smoking at follow-up [19–23]. However, all studies suf-
fered
from
the
issues
discussed
above.
They
only
assessed ever-use [19–22] or past 30-day e-cigarette use
[23] and did not assess the nicotine content of e-
cigarettes used. There was no evidence that adolescents
were regular e-cigarette users at baseline, and no evi-
dence that they were smoking cigarettes regularly at
follow-up. These aspects are crucial in supporting a
gateway
hypothesis,
i.e.,
that
adolescents
became
addicted to e-cigarettes and then transition to addiction
to cigarette smoking. Moreover, it is not clear how e-
cigarettes could be causally linked to cigarette smoking,
unless adolescents became addicted to nicotine and/or
the act and rituals of inhalation through e-cigarette use
and then were curious to try smoking cigarettes. It is
possible
that
these
adolescents
may
have
become
smokers even in the absence of e-cigarettes; in that case,
initiation of e-cigarette use may be related to easier ac-
cess or cheaper price of first-generation disposable prod-
ucts and a predisposition of these subjects to engage in
an inhalational habit. Thus, the ‘gateway hypothesis’ can
be neither supported nor rejected by the findings of
these studies. In contrast, two studies found that the im-
plementation of restrictions on e-cigarette sales to ado-
lescents was associated with an increased smoking rate
among adolescents [24, 25] and another study reported
an association between restrictions on e-cigarette sales
an increased smoking rate among pregnant youth and
young adults [26]. Although the evidence is not conclu-
sive, the potential for e-cigarettes to have a primary pre-
vention role, and the potential for restrictions on e-
cigarettes sales to increase smoking initiation among US
youth, should be carefully considered. Continuous moni-
toring of youth transitions between cigarette smoking
and e-cigarette use through prospective cohort studies
are a public health imperative, but such studies should
assess as their primary dependent variable the preva-
lence of regular or frequent e-cigarette and cigarette
smoking at baseline and follow-up, respectively.
It should also be emphasized that the increasing rate of
ever-use of e-cigarettes among US youth has coincided
with the sharpest declines in youth smoking rates in many
decades. Data from the NYTSs show past 30-day smoking
prevalence in high school students decreased from 15.8%
(2011) to 12.7% (2013) to 9.2% (2014), while in 2015 no
further decrease in prevalence was observed. The 2015
MTF survey showed a continuous decline in past 30-day
smoking prevalence to 7.0% in 2015 compared to 11.7% in
2007. In 2016, further declines were observed in all school
grades (12th grade = 10.5%; 10th grade = 4.9%; 8th
grade = 2.6%) [27].
Among young adults too, between 2010 and 2015, the
period in which the Surgeon General points to rapidly
increasing use of e-cigarettes among US young adults,
the prevalence of smoking reduced by 54% among 18–
19 year-old males and by 64% among 18–19 year-old fe-
males. These reductions are three times and five times
larger, respectively, than the reductions observed be-
tween 2005 and 2010, when e-cigarette use was essen-
tially zero. Given the cross-sectional design of the MTF,
NYTS, and NATS, no conclusive determination can be
made of the role played by e-cigarettes in the observed
incremental declines in smoking prevalence among US
youth and young adults between 2010 and 2015. This
possibility certainly exists, though is not addressed in

 the Surgeon General’s report. At the very least, available
data appear reassuring that e-cigarettes are not deceler-

Use of flavored e-cigarettes
The Surgeon General report presents data from popula-
tion surveys that indicate most adolescents who have
ever used an e-cigarette have used flavored e-cigarettes.
Again, however, the important question is not what fla-
vors are being used, but with what effect are different
flavors being used by youth, young adults, and adults? It
should be expected that good flavors will attract con-
sumers of all ages. Flavors appear to play an important
role in perceived satisfaction and self-reported effective-
ness of e-cigarettes among adults who have used e-
cigarettes to stop smoking. A survey of adult e-cigarette
users, most of whom were former smokers, indicated
that flavors played an important role in their efforts to
reduce or quit smoking with the use of e-cigarettes [28].
Most participants were using multiple flavors on a regu-
lar basis. Additionally, adult smokers appear to prefer
tobacco-flavor when they start using e-cigarette, but as
e-cigarette use develops, preferences appear to dimish
for tobacco flavor and grow for sweet and fruit flavors
[28, 29]. The use of these non-tobacco flavors may help
suppress craving for cigarettes and so help the e-
cigarette user to sustain abstinence from smoking, since
such flavors should be less likely than tobacco flavor to
cue smoking as a conditioned response. Other surveys
have also shown that a small minority of adult e-
cigarette users are using flavorless liquids [30]. Thus, the
decision to ban or restrict flavors should depend on the
balance between the health benefits to adults who man-
age to reduce or quit smoking by switching to use of fla-
vored e-cigarettes, and the need to protect youth who
likely would have never smoked, if it is shown that fla-
vors are indeed a significant determinant of regular e-
cigarette use and subsequent smoking initiation.
Critique of chapter 3: health effects of e-cigarette
use among US youth and young adults
Foreword
Chapter 3 gives an overview of the scientific literature
on the health effects attributable to e-cigarette use, in-
cluding reports of harmful consequences attributable to
e-cigarettes battery explosions and fires, as well as to ac-
cidental overdose of nicotine-containing e-liquids. The
Surgeon General’s document is clear that there are no
existing youth-related health outcomes of exposure to
nicotine in e-cigarette aerosol emissions, and the evi-
dence is limited to studies of adults and/or experimental
models (i.e., animal and in vitro data). With regard to
potential harmful effects of nicotine exposure in utero
and during adolescence, chapter 3 draws from existing
literature on exposure to cigarette smoke because no
data are available for exposure to nicotine carried in e-
cigarette aerosol emissions. By equating findings ob-
tained from smoking conventional cigarettes smoking to
vaping e-cigarettes, a comparable health risk of e-
cigarette use by youth is ultimately portrayed.
Effects of nicotine inhalation by the e-cigarette user
Nicotine uptake through e-cigarette use depends on the
nicotine concentration (mg/ml) of the e-liquid being
consumed, the design of the device, the user’s puffing
behavior, and the user’s experience with the product
[31–34]. This section of the report speculates that high-
performance e-cigarettes may promote higher absorp-
tion of nicotine than tobacco cigarettes. To date, there is
no evidence of this ever occurring; no evidence of nico-
tine overdosing has been reported, even under condi-
tions of compensatory puffing. Levels of plasma nicotine
and cotinine (a stable metabolite of nicotine) in vapers
are comparable to that in cigarette smokers [35, 36].
The causal link between cigarette smoking and cardio-
vascular disease is undisputed [2, 3]. The evidence that
nicotine might be a risk factor for the development of
cardiovascular disease is far less compelling. It has been
suggested that nicotine may contribute to atherogenesis
directly through activation of nicotinic acetylcholine re-
ceptors in the blood vessels [37, 38] and indirectly via
formation
of
inflammatory
mediators
with
pro-
atherosclerotic activity [39]. This evidence is drawn from
laboratory studies using higher doses and more pro-
longed exposures than would ever be seen in real life.
However, current evidence suggests that, at concentra-
tions observed in smokers, nicotine has a minor effect
on the initiation or propagation of atherosclerosis [40].
It seems obvious that the toxic mixture of polycyclic hy-
drocarbons,
tobacco-specific
nitrosamines,
oxidizing
agents, carbon monoxide, and thousands of other che-
micals in the cigarette smoke is responsible for most, if
not all of the atherogenesis, not the nicotine [41]. In his
discussion of short-term clinical trials of e-cigarettes in
adults, the Surgeon General fails to acknowledge the im-
pacts on blood pressure (BP), heart rate (HR) and aortic
stiffness are transient [42–46], and therefore unlikely to
cause clinically relevant harm. We know that the cardio-
vascular risk of nicotine pharmaceuticals and snus is
much lower than the risk from smoking [47–49]. Hyper-
tensive smokers who switch to e-cigarettes show de-
creased
systolic
and
diastolic
blood
pressure
and
improved blood pressure control [50].
The relevance of the Surgeon General’s discussion of
nicotine carried by e-cigarette aerosol is questionable be-
cause it relies almost exclusively on exposure to nicotine
carried by cigarette smoke. The referenced literature
Polosa et al. Harm Reduction Journal  (2017) 14:61 
Page 5 of 10
 describes effects in adults and animal models that have
little relevance to real-world human e-cigarette use. The
animal models feature high nicotine dose, excessive dur-
ation of continuous exposure, and subcutaneous or oral
administration.
Furthermore, the evidence that smoking by adoles-
cents and pregnant women might lead to impaired cog-
nition, attention deficit disorders and mood disorders
later in life, is inconclusive. The literature on this topic
includes several studies showing that anxiety disorders
may precede tobacco use and dependence among ado-
lescents [51]. These bidirectional associations between
adolescent smoking and anxiety in early adulthood do
not prove causality. The same applies to other disorders,
such as ADHD [52] and depression [53]. In any case,
these studies do not show that any increased risk of cog-
nitive impairments and mood disorders can be attrib-
uted to nicotine as distinct from other constituents of
tobacco smoke. Other important confounders such as
genetic predisposition and social influences may also
underlie the development of these disorders [54–56].
Lastly, a recent Cochrane review suggests that use of
medicinal nicotine by pregnant women who smoke has
no negative effects on birth outcomes [57]. A random-
ized trial of use of nicotine during pregnancy showed
that children born to smokers who used pharmaceutical
nicotine products during pregnancy were more likely to
have better developmental outcomes than children of
smokers who received a placebo [58]. All of these find-
ings support the premise that the adverse outcomes are
most likely due to other toxicants carried in tobacco
smoke, not to the nicotine.
Thus, the Surgeon General’s report does not provide
convincing evidence that nicotine decoupled from the
by-products of combusted tobacco causes actual harm
to infants born to NRT-using mothers, adolescents,
pregnant women, or women of reproductive age. Al-
though obviously not recommended for non-smoking
adolescents and pregnant women to use any nicotine-
containing products recreationally, the role of lower-risk
nicotine products may be valuable as a smoking reduc-
tion or cessation aid. Although e-cigarettes are not com-
pletely risk-free, a review of the evidence commissioned
by Public Health England (PHE) stated that the harm as-
sociated with e-cigarettes “is likely to be extremely low,
and certainly much lower than smoking” [59]. Most im-
portantly, in relation to pregnancy, e-cigarette does not
emit carbon monoxide [60], which is particularly harm-
ful to developing babies. That said, the risks to a fetus
from e-cigarette vapor exposure are unknown. Pregnant
women who smoke should be advised to access behav-
ioral support and, if needed, licensed nicotine replace-
ment
therapy
(NRT)
products
to
help
them
quit
smoking. However, if they choose to use an e-cigarette,
and e-cigarette help them to quit smoking and stay
smoke-free, significant harm will be prevented to both
the mother and unborn baby compared to continuing to
smoke [61].
Effects of the inhalation of constituents other than
nicotine
Smokers smoke for the nicotine, but die from the tar in
tobacco smoke [62]. E-cigarettes do not contain tobacco
leaf, do not combust any other organic material, and so
do not produce smoke. The Surgeon General acknowl-
edges that e-cigarettes carry far fewer toxins than ciga-
rettes, and so are likely far less hazardous to the user’s
health. For example, e-cigarette users who do not smoke
show far lower urine levels of tobacco smoke toxicants
than cigarette smokers [63–65]. This section of the re-
port places excessive emphasis on potential absolute
risks of e-cigarette use and fails to consider the likeli-
hood that substituting e-cigarettes for conventional ciga-
rettes can prevent much if not all of the harm caused by
smoking. It references methodologically flawed analytical
laboratory, animal, and cell studies, which have been
largely misinterpreted [60, 66, 67].
The report exaggerates the toxicity of propylene glycol
(PG) exposure in human and animal studies, as reviewed
previously [60] and highlights findings of eye irritation,
cough, and airway obstruction [68, 69] without noting
that these irritant effects quickly disappear [70, 71].
Characteristically, Weislander et al. reported a small but
significant decrease of FEV1/FVC (P = 0.049) [68]. This
was partly driven by an increase in FVC (denominator),
which is paradoxical and not observed in any disease
condition [72]. Moreover, the report does not consider
the possibility that PG might have health benefits. PG, in
its aerosol form, is a potent bactericidal agent [73].
Regular exposure may contribute to the prevention of
respiratory tract infections and exacerbations of chronic
obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) [74, 75]. Add-
itionally, the remarkable fall of exhaled carbon monoxide
from highly toxic levels in smokers to within normal
limits in e-cigarette users [63, 76–78] is not mentioned
in the report.
Effects of toxicants produced during aerosolization
Thermal degradation of propylene glycol and vegetable
glycerin has the potential to form low molecular weight
carbonyls, including formaldehyde, acetaldehyde, and
acrolein [79]. Under conditions of realistic use, these
toxicants are found at far lower levels in e-cigarette
aerosol than in cigarette smoke, and below levels known
to cause substantial harm to humans [80]. Overheating
e-liquids can generate levels of carbonyls exceeding
those found in cigarette smoke [80–82]. This overheat-
ing, however, is extremely unlikely to occur in normal

 use because of the extremely unpleasant taste known as
the “dry puff phenomenon” [80]. Newer e-cigarette
models feature automatic temperature control to pre-
vent overheating. These and future technological ad-
vances together with the implementation of quality and
safety standards promise to further reduce the already
very low levels of carbonyls in e-cigarette aerosol. In-
deed, the totality of the best available evidence of the
toxicity and carcinogenicity of cigarette smoke and e-
cigarette aerosol suggests that while the effects of long-
term aerosol inhalation are as yet unknown, the risk
posed by long-term inhalation of aerosol produced by
properly manufactured e-cigarettes is unlikely to exceed
5% of the risk associated with long-term inhalation of
cigarette smoke [83].
Conclusions
Optimal public health policy would minimize consump-
tion of combustible cigarettes and minimize long-term
use of any other nicotine delivery product among youth
and pregnant women. If cigarettes did not exist, e-
cigarettes would present public health harms, but no
likely benefits. However, in the presence of cigarettes as
the dominant nicotine delivery product in Western soci-
ety, e-cigarettes offer lower risk to users, and may reduce
long-term nicotine use if proven to be less addictive and
easier to quit than cigarettes.
Closer inspection of data reported by the two nation-
ally representative surveys of US youth upon which the
Surgeon General based the claim that ‘e-cigarettes are a
threat to public health’ show the majority of e-cigarette
use among US youth is infrequent and experimental,
and minimal among never-smoking youth. Additionally,
the majority of the very small proportion of US youth
who do use an e-cigarette frequently are actually using
e-cigarettes that do not contain nicotine. The Surgeon
General dedicates limited or no discussion to these data.
Lastly, the increasing prevalence of e-cigarette use be-
tween 2010 and 2015 has coincided with the sharpest
declines in the smoking rate among US youth and young
adults on record.
Compared to conventional cigarettes, e-cigarettes sub-
stantially reduce the user’s exposure to harmful and po-
tentially harmful constituents of tobacco smoke, and
may have a reduced liability for abuse. E-cigarettes differ
from other non-tobacco nicotine products in their
greater acceptance and popularity among adult smokers.
The Surgeon General should also consider the possibility
that e-cigarettes may have the potential to reduce the
likelihood of smoking initiation among youth who may
be especially at risk for initiating smoking in the absence
of e-cigarettes. National and local monitoring patterns of
e-cigarette and cigarette use among youth should be
continuous, with emphasis of measurement on the
prevalence of regular or frequent use, and the prevalence
of likely harm-increasing and harm-reducing transitions
between e-cigarette use and smoking prevalence. Ultim-
ately, regulatory decisions that affect the availability and
attractiveness of e-cigarettes should be determined by
the likely net population impact of taking versus not tak-
ing a particular course of action, which includes the im-
pact on youth and adult smokers.
