Abstract.
Background: Physical activity (PA) can be neuroprotective and reduce the risk for Alzheimer’s disease (AD). In assessing
physical activity, caloric expenditure is a proxy marker reflecting the sum total of multiple physical activity types conducted
by an individual.
Objective: To assess caloric expenditure, as a proxy marker of PA, as a predictive measure of gray matter (GM) volumes in
the normal and cognitively impaired elderly persons.
Methods: All subjects in this study were recruited from the Institutional Review Board approved Cardiovascular Health Study
(CHS), a multisite population-based longitudinal study in persons aged 65 and older. We analyzed a sub-sample of CHS
participants 876 subjects (mean age 78.3, 57.5% F, 42.5% M) who had i) energy output assessed as kilocalories (kcal) per week
using the standardized Minnesota Leisure-Time Activities questionnaire, ii) cognitive assessments for clinical classification
of normal cognition, mild cognitive impairment (MCI), and AD, and iii) volumetric MR imaging of the brain. Voxel-
based morphometry modeled the relationship between kcal/week and GM volumes while accounting for standard covariates
including head size, age, sex, white matter hyperintensity lesions, MCI or AD status, and site. Multiple comparisons were
controlled using a False Discovery Rate of 5 percent.

INTRODUCTION
The global population is aging. In line with an
aging population is a rise in associated chronic
diseases. The number of older persons (aged ≥ 60
years) globally is expected to more than double, from
841 million people in 2013 to more than 2 billion in
2050 [1]. As of 2013, there were an estimated 44.4
million people worldwide with dementia [2]. This
number will increase to an estimated 75.6 million
in 2030, and 135.5 million in 2050. Unfortunately
for those with Alzheimer’s disease (AD), pharma-
cological agents temporarily treat symptoms without
having an effect on the underlying pathophysiology
of the disease. Conventional treatments for demen-
tia are limited, therefore innovative treatment and
prevention strategies are required.
A growing number of studies have investigated
physical activity as a means of reducing risk for
cognitive decline and AD. One randomized clin-
ical trial showed that in persons with subjective
memory impairment, a 6-month program of home-
basedphysicalactivityreducedcognitivedeclineover
a subsequent 18-month period [3]. In a separate,
prospective cohort study, physical activity was inde-
pendently linked to reduced risk for AD [4]. Physical
activity, however, declines with age, such that 54%
of men and 66% of women age 75 and older engage
in no leisure-time physical activity [5]. Importantly,
this decrease in physical activity occurs when this
population is at risk for dementia, namely AD [6].
Several lines of evidence suggest that sedentary
behavior may be a risk factor for the development of
age-related cognitive impairment. A recent review [7]
summarizes evidence to suggest that approximately
13% of AD cases worldwide may be attributable
to sedentary behavior. A 25% reduction in seden-
tary behavior could potentially prevent more than 1
million AD cases globally. From a mechanistic per-
spective, sedentary behaviors may contribute to risk
of AD and dementia by two main factors [7, 8]. First,
they are associated with increased cardiovascular and
metabolic risk factors, such as diabetes, hypertension,
and obesity [9], which are associated with increased
risk of dementia [10, 11]. Second, sedentary behav-
iors appear to have direct effects on neurobiological
processes. A recent review [12] outlines evidence to
suggest that sedentary behavior may have detrimental
effects on the brain via reducing neurogenesis, synap-
tic plasticity, neurotrophin production, angiogenesis,
and by increasing inflammation.
Neuroimaging in humans has also demonstrated
the benefits of physical activity on the brain. Higher
levels of physical activity reduce brain atrophy [13,
14] and improve cognitive function [15] in cog-
nitively normal elderly individuals. Persons who
attain increased brain structure in relation to physical
activity are also less likely to develop mild cogni-
tive impairment (MCI) or AD by 2-fold [16, 17].
Additionally, a randomized clinical trial showed that
exercise training increases anterior hippocampal vol-
ume by 2%, and this volume increase corresponds
to higher serum levels of BDNF and improved spa-
tial memory [18], a type of memory that is affected
early on by AD. We are aware of one study exploring
hippocampal biomarkers (blood flow) in sedentary
older adults [19]. This data suggest that the relation-
ship between cerebral blood flow and sedentary time
is different in APOE �4 carriers and noncarriers and
that sedentary time may act as a behavioral risk fac-
tor for cerebral blood flow dysregulation in those at
genetic risk for developing AD.
While these studies collectively suggest the impor-
tance of physical activity in promoting brain health
and reducing risk for AD, several important questions
remain, namely: i) what is the effect of physical activ-
ity on gray matter (GM) volumes in the elderly, and ii)
what is the threshold of energy expenditure needed
to increase volume of brain structures relevant for
cognition, such as the hippocampus? Moreover, iii)
how does an increase in physical activity over time
change brain structure, and iv) how is pre-existing
AD pathology moderated by an increase in physical
activity? The purpose of this study was to investigate

these questions using neuroimaging data from a
multi-site community cohort.
SUBJECTS AND METHODS
Participants
The CHS-CS is derived from the larger multi-site
Cardiovascular Health Study, a population-based lon-
gitudinal study of coronary heart disease and stroke
in persons aged 65 and older [20]. CHS recruitment
was based on the Medicare eligibility lists in: Forsyth
County,NorthCarolina;SacramentoCounty,Califor-
nia; Washington County, Maryland; and Pittsburgh,
Pennsylvania. The CHS enrolled 5201 participants in
1989-90 and an additional 687 African American par-
ticipantsin1992-93.Theselectionforenrollmentinto
the CHS was not based on cognitive status. The Insti-
tutional Review Board at each site approved the study
methods, and all participants gave written informed
consent. Each year, the participants completed the
Modified Mini-Mental State Examination (3MSE)
[21], the Digit Symbol Substitution Test (DSST) [22],
the Benton Visual Retention Test (BVRT) [23, 24],
and the modified version of the Center for Epidemi-
ology Studies Depression Scale (CES-D) [25].
The CHS memory study
In 1991/1992, 3608 of the CHS participants under-
went a magnetic resonance image (MRI) of the brain.
In 1998-99, the CHS rescanned all available, living
participants and completed neurobehavioral evalu-
ations on them (N = 2101) (See [26] for details).
Information on participants’ cognition was obtained
from their proxies using the Informant Questionnaire
for Cognitive Decline in the Elderly (IQ CODE)
[27] and the dementia questionnaire (DQ) [28].
Complete neurological and neuropsychological eval-
uations were conducted in “high risk” participants,
subjects who had at least one of the following
characteristics: 1) 3MSE score < 80, 2) a change in
3MSE > 5 points from baseline to last contact, 3) IQ-
CODE score ≥ 3.2, 4) living in a nursing home, 5)
incident strokes, 6) dementia diagnosis in medical
records, 7) telephone Interview for Cognitive Status
(TICS) score < 28 [29], or 8) were African-American.
High-risk subjects were examined in three sites
(Hagerstown, Sacramento, and Winston-Salem); the
Pittsburgh site examined all participants. The results
were adjudicated for presence of any disorder that
could affect cognition.
Diagnostic classification
In 1998/99, an Adjudication Committee comprised
of experts in dementia diagnosis classified partici-
pants as having normal cognition, MCI [30], or a
dementia syndrome including subtypes. The Adju-
dication Committee had access to the historical CHS
cognitive test scores, primarily the 3MSE (and sub-
scales), BVRT, and the DSST, as well as: CES-D
scores, vision and hearing testing, history of alco-
hol intake, activities of daily living questionnaire,
IQ-CODE, DQ, vital status, date of death, history
of hospitalizations, treatments and drugs to treat
dementia, results of the current neuropsychologi-
cal assessment, initial and follow-up MRI scans,
neurological examination, and the Neuropsychiatric
Inventory [31].
Due to the late inclusion of the Spoiled Gradient
Recall (SPGR) sequence into the scanning protocol,
not all participants had high-resolution anatomical
imaging.Additionally,notallsubjectshadallvariable
information on physical activity and other variables
used in our investigation. Thus, the present study
includes only the data from the 876 CHS-CS partici-
pants who were cognitively evaluated in 1998/99, had
an SPGR scan whose MRI data met quality control
standards and for whom all other variables such as
physical activity were available for analysis. Subject
demographics are presented in Table 1.
Physical activity assessments
Physical activity in the CHS was evaluated with the
standardized and validated Minnesota Leisure-Time
Activities questionnaire to calculate kilocalories per
week [32–35]. This metric was generated by fre-
quency and duration of time spent in 15 different
leisure-time activities over the previous two weeks.
These activities consist of swimming, hiking, aero-
bics,jogging,tennis,racquetball,walking,gardening,
mowing, raking, golfing, bicycling, dancing, calis-
thenics, and riding an exercise cycle. In the CHS,
kilocaloriedatabaseduponthequestionnairewascal-
culated at baseline in 1989/1998 and at the time MRI
scans were analyzed in this study [32, 36]. For our
investigation, kilocalories were binned into quartiles.
Structural MR imaging
MRI scanning was completed at each of the four
sites using 1.5 Tesla scanners, as detailed else-
where [37, 38]. Briefly, the scanning protocol used in

1991/94 and 1998/99 included a sagittal T1-weighted
localizer sequence, axial T1-weighted spin-density
and T2-weighted images. Axial images were 5 mm
thick without interslice gaps [37]. At all sites, a
3-D volumetric T1 weighted SPGR sequence was
obtained in 1998/99, covering the whole brain
(TE/TR = 5/25, flip angle = 40, NEX = 1, slice thick-
ness = 1.5 mm/0 mm interslice gap), with an in-plane
acquisition matrix of 256 × 256 × 124 image ele-
ments, 250 × 250 mm field of view and an in-plane
voxel size of 0.98 mm3.
Neuroradiologists at a central reading center, who
were blinded to the clinical characteristics of the
CHS participants, identified infarcts on T2-weighted
images (defined as any area of abnormal signal
change of 3 mm or greater in diameter [39, 40]). They
also estimated white matter, ventricular, and sulcal
integrity using a 10-point standardized CHS visual
grading system, ranging from 0 (normal) to 9 (mostly
abnormal). White matter grades (WMGs) were based
on the total extent of subcortical and periventricular
hyperintensities on either axial T2 weighted or spin-
density images, and a WMG of 3 was used to classify
small vessel ischemic disease. The scale has been
validated against white matter hyperintensity vol-
ume normalized for total cerebral parenchyma (See
Appendix in [41]).
Imaging data analysis
Our voxel-based morphometry (VBM) pipeline is
described more extensively in prior work [16, 42].
To improve scan quality, we reduced 3-D non-
linear noise with the Smallest Univalue Assimilating
Nucleus from the FMRI Software Library (FSL) [43].
Images were then stripped of the skull and scalp with
The Brain Extraction Tool from FSL to help improve
the accuracy of brain tissue segmentation [43]. We
used VBM2 (http://dbm.neuro.uni-jena.de/vbm/) in
the Statistical Parametric Mapping (SPM2) software
package, running in MATLAB version 7.4 (The
MathWorks, Natick, MA, USA). We normalized all
images using a 12-parameter affine transformation
and non-linear registration with 16 non-linear itera-
tions to the custom Pittsburgh Elderly Template (419
brains: Mean age 69; 205 men, 214 women [44]).
Images were then visually inspected to ensure that
no major registration errors had occurred and none
were identified.
All images were normalized and modulated to
volumetric units by multiplying all the post-
normalization/segmentation values by the inverse of
the Jacobian determinant of their spatial transforma-
tion matrix. This step corrected for any changes in
the size of the individual voxels during the normal-
ization. Each image was then segmented into GM,
white matter, and cerebrospinal fluid, including a hid-
den Markov random field threshold of 0.3 to remove
isolated voxels of one tissue type that are unlikely to
reside in that particular area. Total intracranial vol-
ume,includingsubarachnoidspace,wascomputedby
summing GM, white matter, and cerebrospinal fluid
volumes.
All images were smoothed using a 3-D Gaussian
kernel (10 mm at full width at half maximum) to
reduce the effects of registration errors and to render
the data amenable to parametric statistical analysis.
In the final step, all scans were masked to exclude
non-gray matter voxels from the statistical search
space.

Voxel-based statistical modeling
Model 1: The main effect of physical activity
on GM volume
A voxel-level, whole brain multiple regression
model was constructed in SPM2 to first examine
the relationship between physical activity and GM
volume. The kilocalories measurement was coded by
quartiles. The covariates in this and in all other mod-
els were total intracranial volume, age, sex, WMG,
body mass index, MCI or AD status, and indicator
variables designating the “site” of the scan to account
for center-to-center variation. A False Discovery Rate
(FDR) threshold (p < 0.05) was applied to account for
multiple comparisons [45] for all models. No extent
thresholds were applied as to identify subtle as well
as large areas of main effects.
Model 2: The main effect of high magnitude
physical activity on GM volume
In this model, we examined the main effect of the
top quartile of physical activity on GM volume to
determine if a threshold effect for physical activ-
ity could be established. The quartiles of physical
activity were recoded into a binary status variable as
follows: Those subjects in the top quartile of physical
activity based upon the kilocalories were designated
as “1”; all other quartiles received a “0” classification.
Separate interaction analysis models between the top
quartile metric, education and race were performed to
ensure that the main effect of high magnitude phys-
ical activity did not change as a function of these
variables.
Model 3: The main effect of change in physical
activity on GM volume
This model investigated potential relationships
between longitudinal changes in physical activity and
GM volume. Kilocalories from CHS study baseline
were subtracted from those calculated at time of brain
MRI. The subsequent number was binned into quar-
tiles and modeled in VBM.
Model 4: Moderation of physical activity
by cognitive diagnosis on GM volume
We modeled the interaction between the top phys-
ical activity quartile of kilocalorie measurements at
the time of MRI (e.g., the independent variable in
Model 2) and cognitive diagnosis in SPM2, to deter-
mine if the atrophic effects of neurodegeneration
on GM volume are moderated by high magnitude
physical activity [46]. We multiplied the two binary
variables by each other to produce an interaction term
representing persons with MCI or AD who were also
in the top quartile of physical activity at time of scan.
This interaction term was coded as a contrast vec-
tor weight of +1 in SPM to determine whether such
persons have larger GM volumes.
The results of the analyses were projected onto
the standard single subject Montreal Neurological
Institute (MNI) template [47] for display purposes.
When projecting onto cardinal sections, we expressed
our results as partial correlations (i.e., rp images) to
obtain a better visual representation of the effect size
[48].
Conversion to MCI or AD
Using the Volumes tool of SPM, we computed
eigenvariates from Models 1–3 to quantify the main
effectofphysicalactivityinbrainareasatriskforneu-
rodegeneration on a region-by-region level. Because
of their exquisite vulnerability to AD pathology, we
focused specifically on the hippocampus and pre-
cuneus and binned the main effect of physical activity
on these regions into quartiles. We then used these
variables as predictor variables in logistic regression
models to determine if the neuroprotective benefits of
physical activity reduced risk for conversion to MCI
or AD 5 years after scan. Because such longitudinal
cognitive data exists only in the Pittsburgh branch of
the CHS [30, 49], we restricted our analysis to the
326 subjects with this information. Covariates in this
analysis were age, gender, education, race, WMG,
MRI infarcts, and APOE4 status.

The results of this model regressed the change in
kilocalories obtained at the time of scan and study
baseline against gray matter volume at a voxel by
voxel level. Figure 3 displays these results. Areas
that demonstrated more gray matter volume with
increased physical activity over time include the left

precuneus (–13, –63, 71).

DISCUSSION
Physical activity is hypothesized to be a preven-
tive measure for multiple diseases, including those

of the brain [15, 50, 51]. This study further investi-
gates the impact of physical activity, measured by
energy expenditure, on GM volumes, volumes of
specific brain structures involved in cognition, and
moderation of pre-existing AD pathology. We found
that the bilateral frontal, temporal, and parietal lobes

associates with higher physical activity. With an
increase in physical activity over time, the left inferior
orbital frontal cortex and left precuneus also associate
with larger GM volumes. High magnitude physical
activity, as measured by the top quartile group in our
study, was also found to associate with in higher bilat-
eral GM volumes in the precuneus extending into the
lingual gyrus, with greater volume on left in these
structures. Additionally, we found that left hippocam-
pal and cerebellar vermis GM volumes vary as a
function of AD or MCI in the top quartile group.
Our findings of exercise-influenced GM volume
increases are supported by other studies that utilized
MRI to demonstrate: i) a linear correlation between
high fitness levels and large hippocampal volumes in
elderlyparticipants[16,52],ii)theassociationofhigh
levels of physical activity in predicting large volumes
of frontal, occipital, and entorhinal regions [16], iii)
an association between large hippocampal volumes
and a reduced risk of developing AD [16], and iv) a
correlation between increased hippocampal volume
and improvement in short-term memory test scores
[53]. Animal studies also support our findings, where
models for causal inference showed exercise has been
found to increase the incorporation of new neurons
into the hippocampus [54].
Previous studies have demonstrated the association
of physical exercise with improved cognitive function
[55–57]. Most notably, physical activity is associ-
ated with a reduced risk of dementia and delayed
clinical expression of AD. For instance, in a prospec-
tive cohort study of cognitively normal individuals
age 65 years or older, the incident rate of dementia
was higher for participants who exercised less than 3
times a week over approximately 6 years [55]. Sim-
ilarly, even low-intensity activities, such as walking,
have been linked to better cognitive status. A study
revealed that men who walked short distances, in
comparison to males who walked longer distances,
had an increased risk and incidence of AD [58].
Moreover, understanding that it is energy expenditure
which is primarily associated with exercise-induced
brain changes adds substantial value to existing epi-
demiologic studies that address the role of increased
physical activity in delaying the clinical manifesta-
tion of AD.
The strengths of our study include: i) the use of
energy output as a function of kilocalories burned as
a predictor of GM volumes, which allows for quan-
tification of physical exercise, ii) a large sample size,
iii) longitudinal follow-up over an extended time-
span, iv) an expert team used for clinical assessment
of subjects, which enables comprehensive evaluation
of patients and increased diagnostic accuracy, and v)
the use of eigenvariates to improve the representation
of the impact of physical activity on brain regions
affected by cognitive decline.
We acknowledge that our study results must be
evaluated in the context of some limitations. It is
possible that reduced amounts of active leisure-time
activities are a reflection of an overall decline in
health associated with preclinical dementia. Further-
more, it is possible that greater physical activity
is a function of larger brain size. Moreover, our
study depended on a self-reported tool for assess-
ment of physical activities, which can potentially
influence the validity and reliability of the acquired
recall data. The evaluation tool only provided infor-
mation on the frequency and duration of activities.
In the future, it will be important to utilize a more
objective measure of quantifying physical activ-
ity that also takes the level exercise intensity into
account (e.g., accelerometers, GPS trackers, pedome-
ters, heat sensors, moisture sensors, and continuous
 C.A. Raji et al. / Longitudinal Relationships between Caloric Expenditure and Gray Matter
727
heart rate monitors). Another area for further inves-
tigation is the similarities and differences of various
physical activity types on the brain (e.g., strength ver-
sus aerobic versus mind-body). This is an area for
further investigation. A recent review by Voelcker-
Rehage and Niemann [59, 60] compares the clinical
effect of ‘metabolic exercise’ (i.e., cardiovascular and
resistance training) and coordinative PA (i.e., motor
fitness, coordination, and flexibility) on cognitive
function and markers of neuroplasticity. The authors
present evidence arguing pure metabolic PA has
greater effects on brain volume and functional activ-
ity, particularly in the prefrontal and hippocampal
areas, as compared to stretching, toning, or relaxation
interventions (for primary evidence, see [18, 61, 62]);
they contribute this effect to differing metabolic
demands [59].
With the elderly population growing rapidly, a
better understanding of preventive measures for
maintaining cognitive function is crucial. Studies
such as this one suggest that simply caloric expendi-
ture, regardless of type or duration of exercise, may
alone moderate neurodegeneration and even increase
GM volume in structures of the brain central to
cognitive functioning. Future studies examining the
preservation of brain matter as a function of physical
activity will help elucidate whether the association
between caloric expenditure and GM volume is a
direct or indirect relationship. Such knowledge can
give individuals the tools to better impact their brain
health throughout the aging process.
