IMPORTANCE Motor vehicle crashes (MVCs) are a major public health problem. Research has
demonstrated that individuals with attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) are more
likely to experience MVCs, but the effect of ADHD medication treatment on the risk of MVCs
remains unclear.
OBJECTIVE To explore associations between ADHD medication use and risk of MVCs in a large
cohort of patients with ADHD.
DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS For this study, a US national cohort of patients with
ADHD (n = 2 319 450) was identified from commercial health insurance claims between
January 1, 2005, and December 31, 2014, and followed up for emergency department visits
for MVCs. The study used within-individual analyses to compare the risk of MVCs during
months in which patients received ADHD medication with the risk of MVCs during months in
which they did not receive ADHD medication.
EXPOSURES Dispensed prescription of ADHD medications.
MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES Emergency department visits for MVCs.
RESULTS Among 2 319 450 patients identified with ADHD, the mean (SD) age was 32.5 (12.8)
years, and 51.7% were female. In the within-individual analyses, male patients with ADHD had
a 38% (odds ratio, 0.62; 95% CI, 0.56-0.67) lower risk of MVCs in months when receiving
ADHD medication compared with months when not receiving medication, and female
patients had a 42% (odds ratio, 0.58; 95% CI, 0.53-0.62) lower risk of MVCs in months when
receiving ADHD medication. Similar reductions were found across all age groups, across
multiple sensitivity analyses, and when considering the long-term association between ADHD
medication use and MVCs. Estimates of the population-attributable fraction suggested that
up to 22.1% of the MVCs in patients with ADHD could have been avoided if they had received
medication during the entire follow-up.
CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE Among patients with ADHD, rates of MVCs were lower during
periods when they received ADHD medication. Considering the high prevalence of ADHD and
its association with MVCs, these findings warrant attention to this prevalent and preventable
cause of mortality and morbidity.

pproximately 1.25 million people die each year glob-
ally as a result of motor vehicle crashes (MVCs).1 In the
United States, more than 33 700 individuals died from
MVCs in 2014 alone, with an additional 2.4 million visiting the

and other high-income countries.3
Attention-deficit/hyperactivitydisorder(ADHD)isapreva-
lent neurodevelopmental disorder comprising symptoms that
include poor sustained attention, impaired impulse control,
and hyperactivity. The disorder affects 5% to 7% of children
and adolescents4 and persists into adulthood in a substantial
proportion of affected individuals.5 Previous studies6,7 have
demonstrated that individuals with ADHD are more likely to
experience MVCs. However, the magnitude of this associa-
tion has varied substantially because of differences in out-
come measures, sample selection, and confounding
adjustment.8
Pharmacotherapy is considered the first-line treatment for
ADHD in many countries, and rates of ADHD medication pre-
scription have increased significantly during the last decade
intheUnitedStatesandothercountries.9,10Evidencefromcon-
trolledtrialshasshownthatpharmacotherapyhasmarkedben-

tent, it also improves driving performance in virtual reality

orddataandself-controlleddesignsprovidesaninnovativeand
informative approach to evaluate the effect of medication use
on important outcomes in real-world situations.14-16 A Swed-
ishregister-basedstudy17foundthatADHDmedicationusewas
associated with lower risk of traffic crashes in men. However,
the association in women was not clear. Moreover, there are
cross-nationaldifferencesinADHDtreatmentpractices18,19and
rates of MVCs1 between Sweden and the United States. In ad-
dition, it is unclear whether ADHD medication treatment will
change the long-term course of the patients and lower the risk
of MVCs.20 Therefore, additional population-based studies in
the United States are needed to evaluate the effect of ADHD
medication use on MVCs.
In the present study, we followed up a national cohort of
patients with ADHD between January 1, 2005, and December
31, 2014, using data from commercial health care claims in the
United States. Specifically, we used a within-individual de-
sign to account for confounding by indication in examining as-
sociationsbetweenADHDmedicationuseandriskofMVCsand
estimated the population-attributable fraction (PAF) of MVCs
in patients with ADHD due to lack of medication treatment.
Methods
Study Sample
We used data from the Truven Health Analytics MarketScan
Commercial Claims and Encounters databases.21 MarketScan
is one of the largest collections of deidentified patient data and
includes inpatient, outpatient, and filled prescription claims
from more than 100 insurers in the United States. There are
approximately 146 million unique enrollee observations since
2005, encompassing employees and their spouses and depen-
dents who are covered by employer-sponsored commercial
health insurance.21 As confirmed with The University of Chi-
cagoinstitutionalreviewboard,theanalysisofMarketScandata
is exempt from approval because all records are deidentified,
and no informed consent is required.
We identified all patients with ADHD 18 years or older, de-
finedasindividualswhoreceivedanADHDdiagnosis(code314
in the International Classification of Diseases, Ninth Edition
[ICD-9]) or ADHD medication between January 1, 2005, and
December 31, 2014. The first inpatient or outpatient diagno-
sis or filled prescription was defined as the index date. We fol-
lowed up each patient from the index date or age 18 years,
whichever occurred later, until the first disenrollment or De-
cember 31, 2014, whichever occurred first. Disenrollment was
defined as zero days of medical or drug coverage in a given
month. A non-ADHD control sample (no ADHD diagnosis or
medication use), matched 1:1 on sex, calendar year, age at first
enrollment, and length of enrollment, was also selected from
the MarketScan enrollees.
We defined ADHD medication using national drug codes
for the following generic names: amphetamine salt combina-
tion, atomoxetine hydrochloride, dexmethylphenidate hydro-
chloride,dextroamphetaminesulfate,lisdexamfetaminedime-
sylate, methamphetamine hydrochloride, methylphenidate,
and methylphenidate hydrochloride. We required prescrip-
tion claims to have valid fill dates and days’supply (≤180 days).
We defined outcome events as emergency department vis-
its for MVCs (ICD-9 codes E810-E825) recorded in the Market-
Scan database. We included only emergency MVC claims to
avoid misclassifying recurring treatment visits as events.
Statistical Analysis

pared the risk of at least one MVC between patients with ADHD
andmatchedcontrols.Oddsratios(ORs)with95%CIswerecal-
culated using conditional logistic regression.
To explore the association between ADHD medication use
and MVCs among patients with ADHD, we created a monthly
person-time data set to compare the risk of MVCs during
months in which patients received or did not receive ADHD
medication. We allowed MVC events to occur multiple times
during the follow-up. A patient was considered to be receiv-
ingmedicationduringagivenmonthifaprescriptionwasfilled
Key Points
Question Is the use of attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder
medication associated with a reduced risk of motor vehicle crashes
in patients with the disorder?
Findings In a national cohort study of 2 319 450 patients with
attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder, the use of medication for
the disorder was associated with a significant reduction in the risk
of motor vehicle crashes in male and female patients.
Meaning Attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder medication use
may lower the risk of motor vehicle crashes, a prevalent and
preventable cause of mortality and morbidity among patients with
the disorder.

 in that month or if there was a carryover from a prior month
(ie, days’supply extended into that month). If a prescription
was filled in the month of an MVC event, the medication was
considered used only if the prescription was filled before the
MVC event. This reclassification occurred in a small number
of instances (n = 107) during less than 0.01% of the included
months. We began with population-level models to compare
the risk of MVCs between medicated months and unmedi-
cated months, with robust standard errors accounting for the
correlations among months within individuals. Odds ratios
were estimated using discrete-time logistic regression,16 ad-
justingfortime-varyingcovariates(age,calendaryear,andtime
since the last MVC event). Because these estimates remained
susceptible to between-individual differences in selection into
treatment,wethenconductedwithin-individualanalysesusing
conditional logistic models, with each individual entered as a
separate stratum.22 That is, each individual served as his or her
own control, and the risk of MVCs during medicated months
was compared with the risk in the same individual while un-
medicated. This model controlled for all unmeasured con-
founding factors that were constant within the individual dur-
ing the follow-up (eg, genetic predisposition and early
environment).17 Because the small changes in years of age and
calendar year during the follow-up were unlikely to influence
the within-individual ORs, we adjusted only for time since the
lastMVCevent.WecalculatedthePAFofMVCsinpatientswith
ADHD due to nonmedication (eMethods in the Supplement).23
To examine the robustness of the within-individual associa-
tions between ADHD medication use and MVCs, we per-
formed 12 sensitivity analyses using different definitions of the
cohort, exposure, and outcome (eMethods in the Supple-
ment). All analyses were performed using statistical software
(SAS, version 9.4; SAS Institute Inc), and all associations were
reported separately for men and women.
In addition, we explored the association between ADHD
medication use and risk of MVCs 2 years later (long-term as-
sociation). In patients with more than 2 years of follow-up, we
examined the association between the lagged medication sta-
tus(2-yearinterval)andMVCs,controllingforconcurrentmedi-
cation status. All person-months in the first 2 years of fol-
low-up were excluded from the model because the lagged
medicationstatuswasundefined.Again,weestimatedtheORs
at population and within-individual levels, with the same ad-
justment for covariates as in the models for the concurrent as-
sociations. Furthermore, we examined the long-term associa-
tions between ADHD medication use and MVCs in patients
without any diagnosis of substance use disorder (SUD) before
or during the follow-up to evaluate whether any associations
were attributable to medication effects on SUD.
Results
The study cohort consisted of 2 319 450 patients with ADHD
(1 121 053 men and 1 198 397 women) observed for a total of
50 667 665person-months.Theirmean(SD)agewas32.5(12.8)
years. During the follow-up, 1 946 198 patients (83.9%) re-
ceived at least one prescription for ADHD medication. A total
of 11 224 patients (0.5%) had at least one emergency depart-
ment visit for an MVC event (Table 1). Patients with ADHD had
a significantly higher risk of an MVC than their matched con-
trols (OR, 1.49; 95% CI, 1.46-1.54 for men and OR, 1.44; 95%
CI, 1.41-1.48 for women) (eTable 1 in the Supplement), and un-
treated patients with ADHD had the highest risk of an MVC
compared with medicated patients with ADHD and controls
(eTable 2 in the Supplement).
Concurrent Associations Between ADHD Medication Use
and MVC Events
At the population level, months with ADHD medication were
associated with a 12% (OR, 0.88; 95% CI, 0.84-0.93) lower risk
of MVCs in male patients with ADHD relative to unmedicated
months and a 14% (OR, 0.86; 95% CI, 0.82-0.90) lower risk of
MVCs in female patients with ADHD (Table 2). More impor-
tant, the within-individual analyses showed that men with
ADHD were 38% (OR, 0.62; 95% CI, 0.56-0.67) less likely to
have MVC events during medicated months relative to un-
medicated months, suggesting that, within an individual (ie,
after controlling for all unmeasured static and measured time-
varying confounding factors), ADHD medication use was as-
sociated with a significant reduction in the risk of MVCs. Our
PAF estimated that 22.2% of the MVCs among male patients
with ADHD were attributable to lack of medication treat-
ment, assuming that the association was causal. A similar re-
duction (42%) was found among female patients with ADHD
(OR, 0.58; 95% CI, 0.53-0.62), which corresponded to a PAF
estimate of 22.1%.

 We observed comparable within-individual estimates of
the association between ADHD medication use and de-
creased MVCs in patients without other psychiatric medica-
tions or psychotherapy, in patients with incident diagnoses of
ADHD, and in patients with different ages or index dates
(Table 3). Analyses using alternative definitions of the expo-
sure (ie, extended medicated periods and stimulant medica-
tions only) and outcome (ie, injuries of motorcyclists and the
broader MVC event definition) also produced results similar
to the main findings. Finally, there was no statistically signifi-
cant association between selective serotonin reuptake inhibi-
tor (SSRI) use and MVCs in men, but we found a moderate as-
sociationbetweenSSRIuseandMVCsinwomen(OR,0.77;95%

Long-term Associations Between
ADHD Medication Use and MVC Events
At the population level, there were no significant associa-
tions between ADHD medication use and MVC events 2 years
later. However, the within-individual analyses showed that
ADHD medication use was associated with a 34% (OR, 0.66;
95% CI, 0.58-0.76) lower risk of MVCs 2 years later in male pa-
tients with ADHD and a 27% (OR, 0.73; 95% CI, 0.64-0.84)

after controlling for concurrent ADHD medication use. The re-

gesting that associations between ADHD medication use and

fect of ADHD medication on SUD.

 Discussion
In this large, nationwide cohort study over 10 years, patients
with ADHD had a higher risk of MVCs compared with controls
without ADHD. However, in male and female patients with
ADHD, medication use for the disorder was associated with a
significantly reduced risk of MVCs. Similar reductions were
found across all age groups, across multiple sensitivity analy-
ses, and when considering the long-term association be-
tween ADHD medication use and MVCs.
Formanypeople,drivingamotorvehicleisanecessaryand
important activity of daily living. However, core symptoms of
ADHD (eg, inattention and impulsivity) may interfere with the
competencies necessary to drive safely, predisposing those
with the disorder to greater risk of crashes and injuries.6,24
Therefore, the use of medications that alleviate ADHD symp-
tomscouldbeexpectedtoreduceunsafedrivingbehaviorsand
consequently lower risks of crashes.17,25 Our results showed
that ADHD medication use was associated with reduced risk
of MVCs. In contrast, research has demonstrated that psycho-
social interventions for ADHD have not addressed driving
problems.26 Our results are in line with previous clinical
investigations13 and one population-based study17 from Swe-
den and further extend the previous findings in 3 important
ways. First, this study is the initial one to date to clarify the
association between ADHD medication use and decreased
MVCs in a large sample of women with ADHD, and we found
that the association in women was as strong as that in men.
This pattern is in line with randomized clinical trials showing
that ADHD medication is efficacious for and well tolerated by
male and female patients.27 Second, to our knowledge, this
study is the first to examine the association between ADHD
medication use and risk of MVCs in a population-based US
sample. Assuming a causal association, our estimates of PAF
suggested that up to 22% of the MVCs in patients with ADHD
could have been avoided if those patients had received medi-
cation during their entire follow-up. The PAF was lower than
the estimate in Sweden (up to 49% in men with ADHD).17 The
strengthsoftheassociationbetweenADHDmedicationuseand
decreased MVCs were similar in this study and the Swedish
study, and the difference in PAFs is mainly due to the fact that
the proportion of medicated time in patients with ADHD in the
United States (50.5%) was higher than that in Sweden (21.1%).
Third, this study is the first to date to demonstrate a long-
term association between receiving ADHD medication and de-
creased MVCs. If this result indeed reflects a protective ef-
fect, it is possible that sustained ADHD medication use might
lead to lower risk of comorbid problems (eg, SUD) or contrib-
ute to long-term improvements in life functioning. Previous
research has suggested that stimulant medication use might
reduce the risk of later substance abuse,28 but we found simi-
lar long-term associations in patients with ADHD without any
SUD diagnoses, suggesting that the association with de-
creased MVCs was not fully explained by SUD. The estimate
of the long-term association also depends on how consis-
tently a patient was medicated during the 2-year interval and
should not be interpreted as the effect of medication use at a
single prior time point on its own.
Our finding that individuals with ADHD had an increased
risk of MVCs compared with individuals without ADHD (1.44
times in men and 1.49 times in women) is consistent with the
results from a meta-analysis8 and some population-based
studies.17,29 However, our estimates were lower than in some
earlier investigations.6 The difference in the effect sizes of
ADHD could partly be explained by methodological differ-
ences in study designs, such as variations in sample selection
or confounding adjustment.7 In addition, the diagnosis and
treatment of ADHD in adults was not a common practice un-
til recent years,30 so earlier studies were likely to have in-
cluded patients with ADHD with more severe symptoms and
therefore found higher risk associated with ADHD. The aware-
ness of ADHD in adults has rapidly increased and influenced
clinical practice across the world.5 With an estimated preva-
lence of 2.5% to 3.4%,31,32 ADHD is one of the most common
mentalhealthproblemsinadults.Failuretorecognizeandtreat
ADHD in adults is detrimental to their well-being,5 and effi-
cacious treatment might help reduce preventable mortality.33
Strengths and Limitations
This study has a number of strengths. We investigated a na-
tional sample of commercially insured patients in the United
States. The sample size is substantial and representative of the
largest segment of US health care users, an estimated 49% of
the US population.21 The design established the temporal cor-
relation between ADHD medication use and decreased MVCs,

 individual analyses, which adjust for all potential confound-
ers that are static during the follow-up (eg, genetic predispo-
sition and early environment). However, because of the
observational nature of these data, we could not account for
allofthepossibleconfoundersthatselectindividualsintotreat-
ment. It is possible that some unmeasured factors (eg, engage-
ment with the health care system) that motivate individuals
to use or stop medications may also decrease or increase the
risk of MVCs. We tested this alternative explanation by using
SSRIs as a comparator. If such unmeasured factors were a main
explanation of the observed association with ADHD medica-
tion use, then we would expect a similar association with SS-
RIs. We found no association between SSRI use and MVCs in
men but observed a moderate association between SSRI use
and MVCs in women, which was substantially weaker than the
association with ADHD medication. One possible explana-
tion is that the association between ADHD medication use and
decreased MVCs in women was partly explained by some gen-
eral effect of receiving medical attention. Another possibility
is that prescription of SSRIs occurred more frequently with
ADHD medication use in women (20.0% in our sample) than
in men (11.3%). Therefore, unmeasured confounding is un-
likelytofullyexplaintheobservedassociationsbetweenADHD
medication use and decreased MVCs. Nevertheless, observa-
tional studies like this one cannot prove causality. Validation
in other samples and triangulation with other designs are
needed to confirm our findings. From a clinical perspective,
itisimportanttoconsiderthecombinedeffectsofillness,medi-
cation use, and associated changes in lifestyle so that our re-
sults can assist patients and clinicians in making informed de-
cisions about treatment and driving safety.14
There are other limitations to consider. First, the use of
ADHD medication was measured by filled prescriptions and
defined at the monthly level. If some patients did not take the
medication as prescribed or only took the medication sporadi-
cally, this limitation would introduce misclassification of ex-
posure and reduce the effect estimates; hence, our results are
likelytobeconservativeestimatesoftheactualeffectsofmedi-
cation use on MVCs. Second, we used emergency depart-
ment visits due to MVCs as our primary outcome. Although we
conducted sensitivity analyses using a broader definition of
MVCs, crashes that did not require medical services (eg, less
severe crashes or some fatal crashes) were not included in our
study. Third, the findings are based on data for patients with
commercial health insurance, and generalizations to other pa-
tient groups should be made with caution.
Conclusions
In a large, national sample of patients with ADHD in the United
States, medication use for the disorder was associated with a
reduced risk of MVCs in men and women in the short term and
the long term. These findings call attention to a prevalent and
preventable cause of mortality and morbidity among pa-
tients with ADHD. If replicated, our results should be consid-
ered along with other potential benefits and harms associ-
ated with ADHD medication use.

Distracted Driving With Attention-Deficit/
Hyperactivity Disorder
Vishal Madaan, MD; Daniel J. Cox, PhD
While driving is a ubiquitous functionality and an important
activity of independent daily living, it also represents a com-
plex neurobehavioral task involving an interplay of cognitive,
motor, perceptual, and visuospatial skills.1 As a result, pa-
tients with neurodevelop-
mental disorders often have
limitations in such skills. Al-
though there has been a recent interest in understanding driv-
ing concerns in individuals with other neurdevelopmental dis-
orders such as autism spectrum disorders, substantial research
has reviewed the influence of attention-deficit/hyperactivity
disorder (ADHD) on driving safety, especially given how phar-
macotherapy may affect inattention, impulsivity, and execu-
tive dysfunction.2 In fact, individuals with ADHD have been
clearly shown to have significantly more driving lapses, driv-
ingviolations,andmotorvehiclecrashes(MVCs)comparedwith
thosewithoutADHD.3Theseresultshavebeenreplicatedindif-
ferent settings with driving self-reports, observational find-
ings, and driving simulators, as well as the MVC data.
Initial pharmacotherapeutic studies4,5 in drivers with
ADHDinvolvedadouble-blind,placebo-controlledtrial,which
highlighted that methylphenidate use improves driving and
that the efficacy of stimulant medications is similar for both
male and female individuals. A crossover design using driv-
ers with clinically diagnosed ADHD compared long-acting
methylphenidate medication use with no medication use and
demonstrated that there were fewer driving accidents during
months when the drivers were medicated compared with
months when they were nonmedicated.6 In this design, rou-
tine driving mishaps were videotaped for 6 months.
The findings in the study by Chang et al7 in this issue of
JAMA Psychiatry confirm and extend existing experimental
studies and have impressive implications for judicious use of
ADHD medication. Using an innovative study design, the au-
thors identified a large cohort of individuals with ADHD from
a commercial insurance database over a decade who were seen
in the emergency department (ED) for MVCs. They noted that
both men and women with ADHD may have a lower risk of
MVCs when medicated. In addition, the study extends the lit-
erature by reporting that stimulant medication use is benefi-
cial across the age span. The methods in the article rely on two
somewhat loosely defined metrics of medication effects and
