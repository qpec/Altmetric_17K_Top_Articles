SUMMARY
Excessive and unresolved neuroinflammation is a key
component of the pathological cascade in brain in-
juries such as ischemic stroke. Here, we report that
TRIM9, a brain-specific tripartite motif (TRIM) protein,
was highly expressed in the peri-infarct areas shortly
after ischemic insults in mice, but expression was
decreased in aged mice, which are known to have
increased neuroinflammation after stroke. Mechanis-
tically, TRIM9 sequestered b-transducin repeat-con-
taining protein (b-TrCP) from the Skp-Cullin-F-box
ubiquitin ligase complex, blocking IkBa degradation
and thereby dampening nuclear factor kB (NF-kB)-
dependent proinflammatory mediator production
and immune cell infiltration to limit neuroinflamma-
tion. Consequently, Trim9-deficient mice were highly
vulnerable to ischemia, manifesting uncontrolled neu-
roinflammation and exacerbated neuropathological
outcomes. Systemic administration of a recombinant
TRIM9 adeno-associated virus that drove brain-wide
TRIM9 expression effectively resolved neuroinflam-
mation and alleviated neuronal death, especially in
aged mice. These findings reveal that TRIM9 is essen-
tial for resolving NF-kB-dependent neuroinflamma-
tion to promote recovery and repair after brain injury
and may represent an attractive therapeutic target.
INTRODUCTION
Tripartite motif containing 9 (TRIM9), a brain-specific ubiquitin
(Ub) ligase, is primarily expressed in neurons and regulates ne-
trin-dependent axon guidance and morphogenesis through the
interaction with vasodilator-stimulated phosphoprotein (VASP),
a mechanism conserved between different species (Hao et al.,
2010; Menon et al., 2015; Plooster et al., 2017; Winkle et al.,
2016a, 2016c). We have shown that TRIM9 is a potent inhibitor
of nuclear factor kB (NF-kB) signaling pathway in in vitro cell
culture upon cytokine stimulation (Shi et al., 2014). However,
the in vivo role of TRIM9 in NF-kB-mediated neuroinflammation
remains elusive.
Ischemic stroke remains a leading cause of mortality and dis-
abilities in the elderly (Benjamin et al., 2017). Excitotoxicity,
oxidative and nitrosative stress, necrosis, and inflammation are
key pathogenic events that contribute to neuronal injury and
cell death after ischemic stroke (Chamorro et al., 2016; Lo
et al., 2005). NF-kB is a master regulator of hypoxia-induced
inflammation (Eltzschig and Carmeliet, 2011) and plays impor-
tant roles in neuronal plasticity, aging, and degeneration
in CNS diseases (Gabuzda and Yankner, 2013; Mattson and
Camandola, 2001; Salminen et al., 2008; Zhang et al., 2013).
NF-kB is a dimeric transcription factor consisting members of
the Rel family, including Rel-A (p65), c-Rel, Rel-B, p50, and
p52, and is often held in the cytoplasm by inhibitor IkB proteins
as its latent form (Chen, 2005). Upon stimulation, the IkB kinase
(IKK) complex phosphorylates the amino-terminal serine resi-
dues (S32 and S36) of IkBa, triggering its ubiquitination and
degradation by the Skp-Cullin-F-box (SCF) Ub ligase complex
and the 26S-proteasome pathway, respectively (Chen, 2005;
Frescas and Pagano, 2008). Consequently, this allows the nu-
clear translocation of NF-kB p50-p65 complex for transcriptional
activation of targeted genes. NF-kB activation in neurons occurs
soon after brain ischemia as evidenced by IkBa degradation and
p65 phosphorylation (Stephenson et al., 2000), which drives the
neuronal expression of inflammatory mediators such as inter-
leukin 6 (IL-6) (Ohtaki et al., 2006) and chemokine C-C motif

 ligand 2 (CCL2) (Stowe et al., 2012). Genetic and pharmacolog-
ical studies targeting NF-kB-activating IKK have shown that
inhibiting NF-kB is generally beneficial for stroke recovery (Herr-
mann et al., 2005; Iadecola and Anrather, 2011). However, this
has been challenged by stroke studies in mouse models with
p50 or cRel deficiency (Harari and Liao, 2010), as well as in sys-
temic injury models (Elsharkawy and Mann, 2007), suggesting
that NF-kB-mediated acute inflammatory response is not just
deleterious. In fact, the acute inflammation responses triggered
by CNS injuries usually resolve within a short period of time,
which set up tissue boundaries for subsequent repair process
(Buckley et al., 2013; Iadecola and Anrather, 2011; Jin et al.,
2010). However, brain-specific factors that govern inflammation
resolution have not been well defined (Iadecola and Anrather,
2011). Hence, understanding the brain’s regulatory mechanisms
that ensure the timely activation and subsequent inactivation of
NF-kB-mediated neuroinflammation is essential to develop a
therapeutic strategy for the recovery and repair after ischemic
brain injury.
Stroke mostly occurs in elderly people, and outcomes of
stroke patients are highly influenced by age, indicating that aging
is an inherent risk factor for stroke (Markus et al., 2005; Popa-
Wagner et al., 2011). Compared to the young brain, the aged
brain displays a compromised ability to resolve stroke-mediated
inflammation, causing high susceptibility to ischemia and poor
functional recovery (Chen et al., 2010). Indeed, upon middle ce-
rebral artery occlusion (MCAO), aged mice exhibit elevated
proinflammatory mediators, large infarction volumes, severe
behavioral impairment, and high mortality rates compared to
young mice (DiNapoli et al., 2008; Jin et al., 2004; Liu et al.,
2009; Rosen et al., 2005; Shapira et al., 2002), reflecting the ef-
fects seen in elderly patients who often experience severe func-
tional disabilities following an ischemia (Hankey et al., 2002).
However, little is known about brain-specific mechanisms that
regulate the resolution of neuroinflammation that are potentially
undermined during aging. Hence, investigating the timely regula-
tion of NF-kB-mediated neuroinflammation is key to a better
understanding of pathophysiology and repair after acute brain
ischemia.
Here, we report that TRIM9 provides an innate mechanism to
resolve ischemic-stroke-induced neuroinflammation via fine-
tuning of in vivo NF-kB signaling activity in a mouse model,
and thus, targeting TRIM9 and its related neuroinflammatory
pathway may offer a target for immunomodulatory therapy for
stroke.
RESULTS
TRIM9 Upregulation in the Peri-infarct Brain Region
after Ischemic Stroke in Mice
Transient MCAO, which mimics ischemic stroke and reperfusion
in rodents, is widely used to investigate post-ischemic inflamma-
tory responses and resolution (Liesz et al., 2009; Shichita et al.,
2009, 2012, 2017). Immunoblotting analysis of NF-kB activation
showed that IkBa degradation and p65 phosphorylation were
evidently induced between 1 and 12 hr after 30-min MCAO
and returned close to a baseline level after 48 and 72 hr in
C57BL/6J (wild-type [WT]) mice (Figures 1A and 1B). This was
consistent with the self-limiting characteristics of post-ischemic
inflammation (Liu et al., 2015) that preceded the repair processes
(Iadecola and Anrather, 2011). We also observed the highly upre-
gulated levels of p-p65 in NeuN-positive neurons of the ischemic
brains at 12 hr after 30-min MCAO compared to those in the
sham-operated group (Figures 1C and 1D). When ischemic
brain tissues isolated 12 hr after surgical procedures were sub-
jected to RNA sequencing (RNA-seq) analysis, the expression
of numerous genes was altered in MCAO-treated tissues
compared to those in sham-operated tissues (Figure 1E).
Remarkably, among those top 20 upregulated genes, only
Trim9 exhibited a brain-specific expression pattern (Berti et al.,
2002) (https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/gene/94090) (Figure S1A;
Table S1). Gene ontology analysis showed that Trim9 was in
the neurological disease and inflammation pathway in which
genes experienced the most significant alteration of expressions
(adjusted p value < 0.01) (Figure 1F; Table S2). Immunoblotting
assays showed the upregulation of TRIM9 in the ischemic brain
hemisphere, when compared with the unaffected contralateral
hemisphere (Figures S1B and S1C). In addition, high resolution
in situ hybridization analysis with RNAscope gene-specific
probes (Wang et al., 2012a) demonstrated that the upregulation
of Trim9 was primarily detected at the periphery of the ischemic
areas in the ipsilateral hemisphere, as compared to a basal level
of the unaffected contralateral hemisphere (Figure 1G). In addi-
tion, no significant difference of stroke-induced Trim9 expres-
sion between 12-week-old male and female mice was observed
(Figure S1D). Taken together, these findings indicate that Trim9
is highly upregulated in the peri-infarct cortical areas of mouse
brain upon ischemic stroke.
Exacerbated Ischemic Brain Injury in
Trim9-Deficiency Mice
Besides aberrant axonal branching in the corpus callosum
(Winkle et al., 2014) and excessive dendritic arborization of den-
tate granule cells in the hippocampus (Winkle et al., 2016b),
Trim9-deficient (Trim9�/�) mice exhibit no gross anatomical de-
fects or impairment in motor functions (Winkle et al., 2016b). We
found that the numbers of NeuN+ neurons, SMI-312+ neuritic
density, Oligo2+ oligodendrocytes, NG2+Oligo2+ oligodendro-
cyte precursor cells, GFAP+ astrocytes, and Iba1+ microglia in
both the somatosensory cortex and hippocampus were nearly
identical between Trim9�/� mice and WT Trim9+/+ littermates
(Figures S2A–S2F). In addition, consistent with the lack of
expression in endothelial cells (Zhang et al., 2014), Trim9�/�
mice showed no change of the middle cerebral artery (MCA) ter-
ritory (Figures S2G and S2H) or alteration of cerebral blood flow
(CBF) before, after, and during 30-min MCAO (Figures 2A and
S2I) compared to WT littermates, indicating that the cerebrovas-
cular system was not affected by Trim9 deficiency. By contrast,
Trim9�/� mice were more prone to ischemic injury than WT litter-
mates, exhibiting a 2-fold increase in infarct volume (Figures 2B
and 2C) and a 2.3-fold enhancement in edema volume (Fig-
ure 2C) at 24 hr after MCAO. Behavioral analysis using a 6-point
motor neurological score method (Wang et al., 2005) showed an
�2-fold decline of neurological outcomes in Trim9�/� mice rela-
tive to WT littermates at 24 hr after MCAO (Figure 2C). Cytokines
and chemokines are important mediators of neuroinflammation

 in stroke (Chamorro et al., 2012; Eltzschig and Carmeliet, 2011;
Iadecola and Anrather, 2011). At 24 hr after 30-min MCAO,
Trim9�/� mice showed a dramatic increase in a panel of inflam-
matory cytokines, including IL-6 and CCL2/5 but no alteration of
IL-10 compared to WT littermates (Figures 2D and S3A). ELISA
showed that tumor necrosis factor a (TNF-a) and IL-1b were
marginally increased in Trim9�/� mice at 24 hr after 30-min
MCAO but became more evident at 36 hr (Liesz et al., 2013) (Fig-
ure S3B). These data suggest TRIM9 functions in dampening
neuronal expression of inflammation mediators of IL-6 and
CCL2 that are upregulated within the first day of stroke (Ohtaki
et al., 2006; Stowe et al., 2012). A terminal deoxynucleotidyl
transferase dUTP nick-end labeling (TUNEL) assay and immuno-
histological analysis also indicated that the ischemic ipsilateral

 brain regions of Trim9�/� mice showed �2-fold increases in
apoptotic cells and neuronal death compared to those of WT lit-
termates (Figures 2E and 2F).
Trim9 Deficiency Causes the Elevation of Peripheral
Immune Cell Infiltration in Mouse Brain
CCL2 (also known as monocyte chemoattractant protein-1) at-
tracts inflammatory immune cells such as monocytes to infiltrate
into brain parenchyma under pathological conditions, which trig-
gers further neuronal dysfunction and damage (Mennicken et al.,
1999). Flow cytometry analysis showed that compared to
MCAO-treated WT littermates, MCAO-treated Trim9�/� mice
had significant increases of CD45hiGR1+CD11b+ granulocytes
and inflammatory monocytes and CD45hiCD11b�CD3e+ T cells
(Figures 3). These results indicate that TRIM9 plays a critical
role in dampening the stroke-induced production and recruit-
ment of inflammation mediators and immune cells, respectively.
TRIM9 Suppresses Neuroinflammation by Inhibiting
NF-kB Signaling
To further examine the role of TRIM9 in brain-specific NF-kB
activation, ischemic brains were harvested 24 hr after MCAO
and then subjected to immunoblotting analysis. This revealed
increased IkBa degradation and p65 phosphorylation (p-p65)
in
the

brains

Trim9�/�
mice

to
those of Trim9+/+ mice (Figures S4A and S4B). Consistently,

 immunostaining also showed increases of p-p65-positive neu-
rons (NeuN) in the peri-infarct area of Trim9�/� mice (Figures
S4C and S4D). To further test this, primary cortical neurons iso-
lated from Trim9+/+ and Trim9�/� embryos (Figure S5A) were
challenged either by 30- or 60-min oxygen-glucose deprivation
(OGD) with reoxygenation for 24 hr (R24h) or by the pro-inflam-
matory cytokine TNF-a or IL-1b for 30–120 min. Immunoblotting
assays showed that the degradation of IkBa was more robust in
Trim9�/� primary neurons upon stimulation with OGD (Figures
4A and 4B), TNF-a, or IL-1b (Figures S5B–S5E) than in Trim9+/+
primary neurons. Correspondingly, the increase of p65 phos-
phorylation was also more evident in Trim9�/� primary neurons
upon TNF-a or IL-1b stimulation than in Trim9+/+ primary neurons
(Figures S5B–S5E). Finally, human neural progenitor cell (hNPC)-
derived neurons (Liang et al., 2016; Wang et al., 2016) were in-
fected with scramble- or TRIM9-specific short hairpin RNA
(shRNA) lentivirus for 24 hr, followed by OGD stimulation for
30- or 60-min shRNA-mediated knockdown of TRIM9 expres-
sion in hNPC-derived neurons led to robust IkBa degradation
and increased p65 phosphorylation upon OGD stimulation (Fig-
ures S5F and S5G). Furthermore, TRIM9-specific shRNA-treated
hNPC-derived neurons were more vulnerable to OGD-induced
cell death than scramble shRNA-treated neurons (Figures 4C
and 4D). These results indicate that TRIM9 is required for
neuronal survival under ischemia and inflammation.
As our previous study demonstrates the TRIM9-mediated
suppression of NF-kB activation via its interaction with b-trans-
ducin repeat-containing protein (b-TrCP) (Shi et al., 2014), we
further showed the TRIM9 and b-TrCP interaction in brain
tissue of MCAO-treated or sham-operated mice (Figure 4E).
In addition, primary neurons isolated from Trim9�/� embryos
were infected with lentivirus containing vector, TRIM9-WT, or

S76AS80A (SA) mutant that no longer inter-
acts with b-TrCP (Shi et al., 2014), fol-
lowed by stimulation with OGD, TNF-a,
or IL-1b. Our data showed that the substi-
tution of TRIM9-WT allowed Trim9�/�
primary neurons to regain their ability
to suppress stimulation-induced NF-kB
signaling, whereas the substitution of the
TRIM9-SA mutant showed little or no effect on NF-kB signaling
(Figures 4F, 4G, and S5H–S5K). When lentivirus-infected primary
Trim9�/� neurons were treated with TNF-a and tested for the
b-TrCP interaction with TRIM9 or IkBa, TRIM9-WT, but not
TRIM9-SA mutant, effectively competed with IkBa for the
b-TrCP interaction (Figure 4H). Consequently, Trim9�/� primary
neurons showed a higher IkBa ubiquitination upon TNF-a +
MG132 treatment than Trim9+/+ primary neurons (Figure 4I).
qRT-PCR also showed higher expression of the inflammatory
mediators IL-6, TNF-a, IL-1b, and CCL2 in Trim9�/� primary neu-
rons upon OGD stimulation than in Trim9+/+ primary neurons
(Figure 4J). These results indicate that TRIM9’s interaction with
b-TrCP is critical for fine-tuning NF-kB signaling and inflamma-
tory responses in neurons.
AAV-PHP.B-Mediated Brain-wide TRIM9 Expression
Ameliorates Ischemic Injury in Trim9�/� Mice
To explore whether in vivo brain-wide expression of Trim9 could
alleviate ischemia-induced neuroinflammation and brain injury in
mice, we utilized an engineered variant of adeno-associated
virus (AAV) serotype 9 (AAV-PHP.B) that can efficiently transfer
genes throughout the CNS following systemic delivery (Dever-
man et al., 2016; Morabito et al., 2017). AAV-PHP.B-mediated
expression of the green fluorescent protein (GFP), the Flag-
tagged murine TRIM9-WT or the SA mutant was readily detected
in Trim9�/� mouse embryonic fibroblasts (MEFs) and primary
neurons (Figure S6A; see also STAR Methods). Subsequently,
AAV-PHP.B:CAG-GFP (PHP.B-GFP), AAV-PHP.B:CAG-FLAG-
TRIM9 (PHP.B-TRIM9), and AAV-PHP.B:CAG-FLAG-TRIM9-SA
(PHP.B-SA) were administrated twice to 12-week-old Trim9�/�
mice following a retro-orbital injection protocol (Deverman
et al., 2016) (Figure 5A). GFP and FLAG-tagged TRIM9-WT or

 SA mutant expression were tested 21 days post-injection. Effi-
cient expression of GFP, FLAG-tagged TRIM9-WT, or SA mutant
was observed in neurons throughout the brain, including the cor-
tex and hippocampus (Figures 5B and S6B). When compared
with PHP.B-GFP- or PHP.B-SA-infected Trim9�/� mice 24 hr
after 30-min MCAO, PHP.B-TRIM9-infected Trim9�/� mice
showed substantially reduced infarct volume (Figures 5C and
5D) and neurological impairments, as indicated by neurological
scores (Figure 5E). An immunoblotting assay of tissue extracts
from MCAO-induced ischemic brain hemispheres showed the
reduced IkBa degradation in PHP.B-TRIM9-infected Trim9�/�
mice compared to PHP.B-GFP- or PHP.B-SA-infected Trim9�/�

PHP.B-TRIM9, or PHP.B-SA and then subjected to OGD condi-
tions, IkBa degradation was considerably lower in PHP.B-
TRIM9-infected Trim9�/� neurons than in PHP.B-GFP- or
PHP.B-SA-infected Trim9�/� neurons (Figures S6E and S6F).
These results collectively indicate that AAV-PHP.B-mediated
brain-wide TRIM9 expression effectively resolves inflamma-
tory responses in neurons, providing neuroprotection against
ischemic stroke.
AAV-PHP.B-Mediated Brain-wide TRIM9 Expression
Alleviates Ischemic Injury in Middle-Aged Mice
A previous genome-wide analysis reports that the stroke-induced
expression of a specific group of genes, including Trim9, is
considerably lower in the ipsilateral cortex of aged rats than in
that of young rats (Buga et al., 2012). A similar level of TRIM9
expression in the brain was observed between 12-week-old
young mice and 70-week-old middle-aged mice under normal
conditions. In contrast, the stroke-induced upregulation of
TRIM9 expression was detectably lower in aged mouse brains
than in young mouse brains (Figures 6A and 6B). The stroke-
induced expression of two key inflammatory mediators, IL-6 (Fig-
ures6Cand6D) andCCL2 (Figures6Eand6F),wasinduced much
higher in aged mouse brains than in young mouse brains.
To examine in vivo expression of Trim9 to alleviate ischemia-
induced neuroinflammation in aged mice, 70-week-old C57BL/
6J mice were retro-orbitally injected with PHP.B-GFP or
PHP.B-TRIM9 and subjected to 30-min MCAO, followed by
neurological tests at 24 hr. When compared with PHP.B-GFP-in-
fected aged mice, PHP.B-TRIM9-infected aged mice showed
substantially reduced infarct areas (Figures 6G and 6H) and
neurological impairments, as indicated by neurological scores
(Figure 6I). Confocal microscopy showed that compared to
PHP.B-GFP-infected aged mice, PHP.B-TRIM9-infected aged
mice had reduced levels of p-p65-positive neurons (NeuN) in
the peri-infarct cortex (Figures 6J and 6K) and neuronal cell
death, as indicated by TUNEL+NeuN+ double-positive cells in
the infarct cortex (Figures 6L and 6M). The strong correlation be-
tween the p-p65-positive neuron population level and the motor
neurological behavior score was observed in PHP.B-GFP- or
PHP.B-TRIM9-infected aged mice (Figure 6N). These results
collectively demonstrate that AAV-PHP.B-mediated brain-wide
TRIM9 expression effectively alleviates neuroinflammation and
ameliorates neuropathological and neurological outcomes after
ischemic stroke.
DISCUSSION
The acute inflammatory response and its resolution are indis-
pensable for body’s physiological repair process after injuries,
while unresolved inflammation is implicated in a body of human
diseases, including CNS injuries (Schwartz and Baruch, 2014).
Inflammation resolution in the CNS is a highly organized active
process that requires complex crosstalk between injured neu-
rons, glial cells, and infiltrating inflammatory cells (Schwartz
and Baruch, 2014). However, brain factors that govern the reso-
lution of neuroinflammation are yet to be defined (Iadecola and
Anrather, 2011). By revisiting the brain’s endogenous genes
within the inflammatory response network that were activated
upon ischemic injury, we identified TRIM9 as a brain-specific
modulator of NF-kB-dependent neuroinflammation (Figure 1).
It governs the resolution of post-ischemic inflammation and
consequently improves neuropathological and neurological

 outcomes in the mouse model of acute ischemic stroke (Fig-
ure 2). Accordingly, Trim9 deficiency is accompanied by
elevated pro-inflammatory cytokine production, inflammatory
cell infiltration, subsequent neuronal death, and exacerbated
brain injury after MCAO (Figures 2 and 3).
Pro-inflammation, anti-inflammation, and pro-resolution sig-
nals converge on the NF-kB pathway. In acute ischemia,
NF-kB activation in injured neurons initiates strong inflammatory
responses via production of proinflammatory mediators. TRIM9
expression is strongly increased in the peri-infarct area in a
mouse stroke model (Figure 1G). This delayed surge of Trim9
expression ensures timely antagonization of NF-kB activity and
tissue resolution of inflammation, as we showed that the brain-
wide expression of TRIM9 effectively promoted resolution of
neuroinflammation and alleviated neuronal death in TRIM9-defi-
cient mice (Figure 5). Our findings indicated that the balance be-
tween these pathways could be adjusted temporally by TRIM9
after ischemic stroke. AAV-PHP.B-mediated TRIM9 expression
ameliorates the ischemic neuropathology and neurological out-
comes in young Trim9�/� mice (Figure 5) and 70-week-old WT
mice (Figure 6). This suggests that targeting TRIM9 for better res-
olution of neuroinflammation may offer a potential target for

 immunomodulatory therapy for acute ischemia. Previous studies
have shown that the infiltration pattern of peripheral immune
cells and timing of immune activation differ in stroke (Chamorro
et al., 2012; Iadecola and Anrather, 2011; Jin et al., 2010), sug-
gesting that the infarct or behavior could possibly change over
time. Investigation of stroke-related neuropathology on later
time-point than 24 hr could provide more useful information
about the resolution of inflammation, especially in aged mice.
Older women have a much higher incidence of stroke than
men as well as a worse prognosis, which is recapitulated in ro-
dent model; for instance, aged female mice display a larger
infarct volume upon stroke than aged male mice (Liu et al.,
2009). In the current study, aged female mice were specifically
chosen to evaluate the therapeutic potential of AAV-based
gene therapy, since TRIM9 expression was similar between
young male and female mice (Figure S1D). As a huge body of
literature on stroke and inflammation has used young male
mice as MACO animal models (Herrmann et al., 2005; Kawano
et al., 2006; Liesz et al., 2009, 2013; Reischl et al., 2014; Sarabi
et al., 2008; Shichita et al., 2009, 2012, 2017; Strecker et al.,
2011; Wang et al., 2016), and we also utilized young male mice
to maintain consistency with previous studies. It is well known
that the aged population is not only highly susceptible to
ischemic stroke but also shows slow recovery from ischemic
stroke. However, the basis of this high susceptibility and slow re-
covery of the aged population is very complex, with numerous
contributing factors. We found that the upregulation of TRIM9
expression appeared to be critical to resolve inflammation in
the peri-infarct region of brain and minimize the injury size. How-
ever, this stroke-induced upregulation of TRIM9 expression was
compromised in aged mice, causing sustained neuroinflamma-
tion and enhanced ischemic damage. Induction of Trim9 expres-
sion in the peri-infarct areas of ischemic brain occurred during
the early stage. Additional studies are necessary to understand
the molecular mechanism of Trim9 expression under normal
conditions versus ischemic stroke conditions.
The MCAO model we used here is an acute stroke mouse
model, which does not allow a sufficient time window for target
gene delivery for gene therapy. For example, while AAV mutant
AAV-PHP.B enabled brain-wide expression of TRIM9 gene
with high efficiency (Deverman et al., 2016), TRIM9 gene delivery
still required days (or even more than a week) after AAV injection.
Alternative methods to quickly upregulate endogenous TRIM9
expression may provide its systemic expression for post-stroke
treatment. Lastly, the pre-stroke strategies may be utilized as
prevention approaches, which would represent a potential ther-
apeutic method for the aging population, especially in at-risk
older women. Further study is needed to evaluate a number of
methods to upregulate brain-specific TRIM9 expression.
Parkinson’s disease (PD), the second most common age-
associated neurodegenerative disorder, is characterized by the
loss of dopaminergic neurons (Obeso et al., 2010), as well as
chronic neuroinflammation (McGeer and McGeer, 2004). Specif-
ically, post-mortem analyses of human PD patients and experi-
mental animal studies shows that the chronic increase of pro-
inflammatory cytokines and the infiltration and accumulation of
immune cells from the periphery are also implicated in the path-
ogenesis of PD (Barcia et al., 2003; Hirsch and Hunot, 2009;
Hirsch et al., 2012). Intriguingly, a previous study showed that
Trim9 expression was significantly downregulated in the brains
of PD and Lewy body dementia (Tanji et al., 2010). We showed
that AAV-PHP.B-mediated Trim9 expression markedly reduced
neuroinflammation in young Trim9�/� mice (Figure 5) and mid-
dle-aged WT mice (Figure 6), leading to improvement of the
ischemic neuropathology and neurological outcomes. This sug-
gests that manipulating Trim9 expression for better resolution of
neuroinflammation may offer prospect to immunomodulatory
therapy for PD, ischemic stroke, and even other neurodegener-
ative diseases. A better understanding of the role of TRIM9-
mediated regulation of inflammation would provide insight into
the neuropathological processes and help to establish effective
therapeutic strategies.

Cell Reports 27, 549–560.e1–e6, April 9, 2019
 Human neural progenitor cell (hNPC)-derived neurons
Human neural progenitor cell (hNPC) from fetal origin (the sex is unavailable) (Guo et al., 2013; Wang et al., 2010) were maintained as
neurospheres in DMEM/F12-N2 supplemented with 20 ng/ml (1.4 nM) bFGF (Sigma-Aldrich, St. Louis, MO) in low-attachment T-25
flasks (Corning, Acton, MA) (Wang et al., 2016). For differentiation, hNPC were plated on poly-L-Orthithine (10 mg/ml) and laminin
(10 mg/ml) coated round cover glasses in 4-well plates at a density of 4 3 105 per well in STEMdiff Neuron Maturation medium
(StemCell Technologies, Inc.) and incubated for 10 days in vitro to allow for differentiation.
Mouse embryo fibroblasts (MEFs)
MEFs from Trim9�/� mice (the sex is unavailable) was isolated and cultured, as previously described (Durkin et al., 2013). Briefly, E13
embryos were harvested and digested by 0.25% trypin-EDTA. Cell suspension was cultured with MEF culture medium containing
DMEM supplemented with 10% FBS and 100 U ml-1 penicillin-streptomycin in T75 flasks.
Mice
The Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee at the University of Southern California approved all procedures per the National
Institutes of Health guidelines. Mice were housed in plastic cages on a 12h light cycle, with ad libitum access to water, with standard
laboratory diet, and in a specific pathogen-free facility. Trim9+/� heterozygous mice (Winkle et al., 2014) were bred to generate age-
matched Trim9�/� and littermates Trim9+/+ mice. Male (Liesz et al., 2009; O’Collins et al., 2006; Shichita et al., 2009, 2012) Trim9+/+
and Trim9�/� mice with 12-week-old were used. C57BL/6J mice were purchased from the Jackson Laboratory (JAX stock 000664).
Because there is a significant sex effect on the pathology of brain ischemia (Liu et al., 2009; Wendeln et al., 2018), where both male
and female mice were compared, only female aged C57BL/6J mice with 70-week-old were used in the present study. All the animals
that survived surgical procedures were included in the study. All animals were randomized for all stroke studies and procedures. All
experiments were blinded; the operators responsible for experimental procedure and data analysis were blinded and unaware of
group allocation throughout the experiments.
METHOD DETAILS
Transient middle cerebral artery occlusion (MCAO)
Using a 27-½ gauge needle, mice were anesthetized with 100 mg/kg Ketamine intraperitoneally (IP) and 10 mg/kg IP xylazine. Rectal
temperature was maintained at 37�C using a feedback-controlled heating system. MCA was occluded for 30 minutes using a silicon-
coated nylon monofilament (DOCCOL, CO) as we previously described (Wang et al., 2012b). Cerebral blood flow was monitored by
laser Doppler flowmetry (Transonic Systems). Mice with an adequacy of MCAO as evidenced by R 80% drop in the cerebral blood
flow were included in the study. Motor neurological examination was determined after 24 hours, using the following criteria: no neuro-
logical deficit, 0; failure to extend left forepaw fully, 1; turning to left, 2; circling to left, 3; unable to walk spontaneously, 4; and stroke-
related death, 5. All mice were euthanized 0, 1, 4, 12, 24, 36, 48, or 72 hours after the MCAO for indicated analysis. All animals that
were survived from surgical procedures were included in the study.
Immunoblotting
Brain tissue or cell lysates were collected in 1% NP40 buffer with the protease inhibitor cocktail (Roche, catalog # 4693159001) and
phosphatase inhibitor PhosSTOP (Roche, catalog # 4906845001), and protein amounts were quantified by BCA protein assay kit
(Thermo Fisher Scientific, catalog # 23227). Proteins were separated by SDS-PAGE and transferred to PVDF membrane (Bio-
Rad, catalog # 1620177)) by semi-dry transfer at 25V for 30 min. All membranes were blocked in 5% milk in PBST for 1 h and probed
overnight with indicated primary antibodies in 5% BSA at 4�C. Primary antibodies included: mouse monoclonal anti-IkBa antibody
(Cell Signaling, catalog # 9247, 1:2000), rabbit monoclonal anti-phospho-IkBa antibody (Cell Signaling, catalog # 2859, 1:1000), rab-
bit monoclonal anti-phospho-p65 antibody (Cell Signaling, catalog # 3033, 1:1000), mouse monoclonal anti-b-actin antibody (Santa
Cruz, catalog # sc-47778, 1:2000), rabbit polyclonal anti-TRIM9 antibody (Winkle et al., 2014) (1:2000, generated using murine TRIM9
recombinant protein aa 158-271; reacting with three isoform a/b/c), mouse monoclonal anti-ubiquitin antibody (Santa Cruz, catalog #
sc-8017, 1:1000), rabbit monoclonal anti-b-TrCP antibody (Cell Signaling, catalog # 4394, 1:1000), mouse monoclonal anti-HA anti-
body (Santa Cruz, catalog # sc-57594, 1:2000), mouse monoclonal anti-GFP antibody (Santa Cruz, catalog # sc-101525, 1:2000),
and mouse monoclonal anti-Flag antibody (Sigma, catalog # F1804, 1:2000). Appropriate HRP-conjugated secondary antibodies
were incubated on membranes in 5% milk and bands were developed with ChemiDoc Touch imaging system (Bio-Rad) and analyzed
in Image Lab software.
Tissue staining
At endpoint, mice were anesthetized and transcardially perfused with PBS and fixed with 4% PFA. Mouse brains were post-fixed
overnight in 4% PFA at 4�C. For cryosectioning, fixed tissues were cryoprotected in 30% sucrose in PBS overnight at 4�C and
embedded in Tissue-Tek OCT compound (VWR, catalog # 25608-930). Cryostat sections were cut at 20 mm thickness. Mouse brain
sections were permeabilized in PBS-T (PBS containing 0.2% Triton X-100) for 10 min, blocked with 5% normal donkey serum
(Jackson ImmunoResearch, catalog # 017-000-121) for 60 min and incubated in primary antibody diluted in the blocking solution
overnight at 4�C. Primary antibodies used in this study include mouse monoclonal anti–glial fibrillary acidic protein (GFAP) (cell

Mouse monoclonal anti-Flag (Sigma, catalog # F1804), Rabbit monoclonal anti-phospho-p65 (Cell Signaling, catalog # 3033), Rat
monoclonal anti-IL6 (Thermo Fisher Scientific, catalog # AMC0864), and Rabbit polyclonal anti-CCL2 (Abcam, catalog # 9779). After
three washes with PBS, sections were incubated with the secondary antibodies for 1 h, including Alexa 488-conjugated donkey
anti-mouse (Thermo Fisher Scientific, catalog # A21202), Alexa 488-conjugated donkey anti-rabbit (Thermo Fisher Scientific, catalog
# A-21206), Alexa 568-conjugated donkey anti-mouse (Thermo Fisher Scientific, catalog # A10037), Alexa 568-conjugated donkey
anti-rabbit (Thermo Fisher Scientific, catalog # A10042), Alexa 647-conjugated donkey anti-rabbit (Thermo Fisher Scientific, catalog
# A-31573), Alexa 488-conjugated donkey anti-rat (Thermo Fisher Scientific, catalog # A-21208), and Alexa 647-conjugated donkey
anti-rat (Jackson ImmunoResearch Laboratories, catalog # 712-605-153). All images were taken with the Zeiss 510 confocal micro-
scopy or using the BZ 9000 all-in-one Fluorescence Microscope from Keyence (Osaka, Japan), and analyzed using NIH ImageJ
software.
RNA sequencing
RNA was prepared using TRIzol Reagent (Thermo Fisher Scientific, catalog # 15596018) followed by RNeasy Mini Kit (QIAGEN, cat-
alog # 74104). The libraries were made using KAPA stranded mRNA-seq kits (KAPA Biosystems, catalog # kk8421) according to
manufacturer’s protocol. The cDNA libraries were sent to the Technology Center for Genomics & Bioinformatics at UCLA for
sequencing on HiSeq 3000 with single end read (�30 million reads per sample). RNA-seq data was inspected by FastQC (Simon,
2010). Using default settings, STAR version 2.5.2b (Dobin et al., 2013) were used to map reads to mouse genome GRCm38. Align-
ment results were processed for gene quantification using featureCounts version 1.5.1 (Liao et al., 2014) with the second strand-
specific option. Differentially expressed genes were determined using DESeq2 version 1.14.1 (Love et al., 2014). The significantly
changed genes were analyzed using the Ingenuity Pathway Analysis tool for functional analysis. The comparison of expression levels
of the upregulated genes was performed by RPKM value of each gene from existing RNaseq data in NCBI.
RNAscope in situ hybridization
Trim9 mRNA transcripts were detected using murine gene-specific probe (Advanced Cell Diagnotics, catalog # 479071) and visual-
ized using the RNAscope 2.5 HD Reagent Kit RED (Advanced Cell Diagnotics, catalog # 322360) on 4% paraformaldehyde (PFA)
fixed frozen mouse brain tissue sections, according the manufacturer’s instructions, followed by counterstaining with hematoxylin
(Vector Laboratories, catalog # H3401). Sections were imaged using the BZ 9000 all-in-one Fluorescence Microscope from Keyence
(Osaka, Japan), and analyzed using NIH ImageJ software.
Visualization of the anastomotic line between the middle cerebral artery (MCA) and anterior cerebral artery (ACA)
We performed an assay with the procedures as previously described (Wang et al., 2005). Briefly, latex mixed with carbon black was
injected through the cannulated aorta of mouse. Anastomotic lines between the MCA and the ACA territories were determined by
tracing peripheral branches on dorsal brain surfaces of mice to the points at which vessels were connected (dotted red line).
Cresyl violet staining and neuropathological analysis
Mouse brain sections from five equidistant rostrocaudal brain levels, at �1.6 mm, �0.8 mm, 0 mm, 0.8 mm and 1.6 mm from bregma,
were fixed by methanol and stained with the Cresyl Echt Violet staining kit (American MasterTech, catalog # AHC0443). Sections
were digitized and transformed into gray model, and the border between infarct and non-infarct tissue was outlined using an image
analysis system (ImageJ). On these sections, infarct volume and brain swelling were quantified. The infarct volume was calculated by
subtracting the volume of the non-lesioned area in the ipsilateral hemisphere from the volume of the whole area in the contralateral
hemisphere (Wang et al., 2013). The edema volume was calculated by subtracting the volume of the contralateral hemisphere from
the volume of the ipsilateral hemisphere(Wang et al., 2005).
RT-qPCR
Total RNAs were extracted from mouse brain tissues or mouse primary neurons using TRIzol Reagent (Thermo Fisher Scientific, cat-
alog # 15596018) followed by RNeasy Mini Kit (QIAGEN, catalog # 74104) according to the manufacturer’s instructions. The purified
RNA was reversely transcripted to cDNA using iScript cDNA Synthesis Kit (Bio-Rad, catalog # 1708891). All gene transcripts were
quantified by quantitative PCR using iQ SYBR Green supermix (Bio-Rad, catalog # 1708880) on CFX96 real-time PCR system
(Bio-Rad). Primer sequences are listed in Table S3.
ELISA
Mouse brain tissues were isolated and homogenized mechanically. The resulting supernatants were collected and their concentra-
tion of IL-6, IL-1b, TNF-a or IL-10 was determined with a mouse-specific ELISA kit (BD Biosciences, catalog # 555240 for IL-6,
559603 for IL-1b, 555268 for TNF-a, 555252 for IL-10), and this was followed by analysis with the FilterMax F5 multi-mode microplate
reader (Molecular Devices).

 TUNEL staining
Terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase-mediated dUTP nick endlabeling (TUNEL) assay was employed to demonstrate apoptotic
cells. Using the In Situ Cell Death Detection Kit, Fluorescein (Roche, catalog # 11684795910) or In Situ Cell Death Detection Kit,
TMR red (Roche, catalog # 12156792910), brain sections were treated following the procedure specified by the manufacturer.
Analyzing infiltrating immune cells
The mice were transcardially perfused with PBS containing 0.05 M EDTA extensively to remove blood cells in the circulation. The
forebrain (bregma from �3 to 3) of the hemisphere was removed and dissociated using neural tissue dissociation kit (MACS Miltenyl
Biotec, catalog # 130093231). Ipsilateral (ischemic) hemisphere of the forebrain was used while contralateral hemisphere of the fore-
brain was used as sham control. Debris was removed by Debris Removal Solution (MACS Miltenyl Biotec, catalog # 130109398) fol-
lowed by removal of red blood cells (Biolegend, catalog # 420301). Cell suspensions were stained with propidium iodide (Invitrogen,
catalog # P3566) and fluorochrome-conjugated antibodies including CD45 (APC/Cy7, 1:100, catalog # 103116), CD11b (eFluor450,
1:100, catalog # 48-0112-82), CD11c (PE/Cy7, 1:100, catalog # 117318), CD3e (PerCP/Cy5.5, 1:100, catalog # 100328), or GR1
(APC, 1:100, catalog # 108412). Subsequently, the stained suspensions were analyzed with BD FACSCanto II flow cytometer and
analyzed with FlowJo software. Each cell type was indicated by percentage of CD45 positive cells. All antibodies were purchased
from eBioscience or BD PharMingen. Propidium iodide staining was used to gate live cells.
Immunocytochemistry
Cultured mouse primary neurons were fixed with 4% PFA at room temperature for 20 min, permeabilized, and stained with
primary antibodies, including rabbit polyclonal anti-TRIM9(Winkle et al., 2014) and mouse monoclonal anti-MAP2 (Abcam, catalog #
ab11267), followed by incubation of secondary antibodies including Alexa 488-conjugated donkey anti-mouse (Thermo Fisher Sci-
entific, catalog # A21202) and Alexa 568-conjugated donkey anti-rabbit (Thermo Fisher Scientific, catalog # A10042). All images were
taken with the BZ 9000 all-in-one Fluorescence Microscope from Keyence (Osaka, Japan) and analyzed using NIH ImageJ software.
Oxygen and Glucose Deprivation (OGD)
Mouse primary cortical neurons or hNPC-derived neurons were treated with OGD by replacing culture medium with a glucose-free
Neurobasal medium (Thermo Fisher Scientific, catalog # 21103049), and they were immediately placed in a hypoxic incubator cham-
ber (STEMCELL, catalog # 27310) flushed with a gas mixture of 94%N2/5%CO2/1%O2. After OGD for the indicated time, medium
was replaced by standard medium, and cells were cultured under normal condition for reoxygenation of 24 h.
Lentivirus infection
Lentiviral vector-mediated in vitro gene delivery was performed as previously described(Shi et al., 2014). Briefly, hNPC-derived
neurons or mouse primary neurons were cultured with medium containing 5 mg/ml polybrene (Sigma, catalog # H9268) and 5 3
105 infectious units of lentiviruses containing the following: scrambled shRNA, TRIM9-specific shRNAs (target sequence for human:
5-CGATGCCCTCAACAGAAGAAA-3), pCDH lentivirus expressing mouse HA-TRIM9, or pCDH lentivirus expressing HA-SA mutant
of TRIM9. At 48 h post infection, cells were further treated with OGD or other conditions as indicated.
Live-Dead Cell assay
hNPC-derived neurons were washed with PBS. LIVE-DEAD Viability/Cytotoxicity Kit (Thermo Fisher Scientific, catalog # L3224) was
used to quickly discriminate live from dead cells by simultaneously staining with green-fluorescent calcein-AM to indicate intracel-
lular esterase activity and red-fluorescent ethidium homodimer-1 to indicate loss of plasma membrane integrity. The samples were
immediately imaged by the BZ 9000 all-in-one Fluorescence Microscope from Keyence (Osaka, Japan) and analyzed using ImageJ
software.
Immunoprecipitation
For co-IPs, brain tissues and cells were lysed with RIPA minimum lysis buffer (Millipore, catalog # 20-188)). After clarification and pre-
clearing, protein amounts were quantified by BCA protein assay kit (Thermo Fisher Scientific, catalog # 23227). 1/10 of cell lysates
were heated as whole cell lysate in immunoblotting, and the remained 9/10 lysates were incubated for 16 h with indicated antibodies,
followed by additional incubation with Pierce Protein A/G Agarose (Thermo Fisher Scientific, catalog # 20422) for 2h. Immune com-
plexes were washed with lysis buffer and subjected to immunoblotting analysis. For ubiquitination, cells were initially lysed with RIPA
buffer containing 1% SDS, then cell extracts were diluted with RIPA buffer to 0.1% SDS concentration. Finally 1/9 of the diluted
extracts were heated as whole cell lysate in immunoblotting and the remained 9/10 lysates were subjected to IP and IB.
Adenovirus associated virus (AAV) mediated in vivo delivery of Trim9
For in vivo delivery of Tirm9 to the central nervous system, we intravenously injected 12-week-old Trim9�/� mice or 70-week-old
C57BL/6J mice at retro-orbital site using a AAV-PHP.B vector, a method that allows widespread gene transfer to the adult brain
(Deverman et al., 2016), either expressing mouse Trim9 (NM_001110203.1) under the control of a CAG promoter (AAV-
PHP.B:CAG-TRIM9), TRIM9-SA mutant (AAV-PHP.B:CAG-TRIM9-SA), or a control vector encoding the green fluorescent protein

 (AAV-PHP.B:CAG-GFP). Retro-orbital injections of 1.5 3 1012 genome copies per mouse was performed twice at 21 and 18 days
before MCAO, to allow sufficient re-expression of TRIM9 in the CNS.
QUANTIFICATION AND STATISTICAL ANALYSIS
The sample size chosen for our animal experiments in this study was estimated based on our prior experience performing similar
experiments. For all the bar graphs, data was expressed as mean ± s.d. The various types of statistical analysis were performed
using GraphPad Prism and by an investigator blinded to the experimental conditions, including two-way ANOVA test, Mann-
Whitney U test, Wilcoxon matched pair test, one-way ANOVA followed by Tukey’s post hoc analysis, one-way ANOVA followed
by Bonferroni’s post hoc analysis, and two-tailed Student’s t test was performed using GraphPad Prism. P value < 0.05 was
considered statistically significant.
