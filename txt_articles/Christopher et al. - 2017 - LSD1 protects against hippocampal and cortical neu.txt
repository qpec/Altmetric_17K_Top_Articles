To investigate the mechanisms that maintain differentiated cells, here we inducibly delete the
histone demethylase LSD1/KDM1A in adult mice. Loss of LSD1 leads to paralysis, along with
widespread hippocampus and cortex neurodegeneration, and learning and memory defects.
We focus on the hippocampus neuronal cell death, as well as the potential link between LSD1
and human neurodegenerative disease and find that loss of LSD1 induces transcription
changes in common neurodegeneration pathways, along with the re-activation of stem cell
genes, in the degenerating hippocampus. These data implicate LSD1 in the prevention of
neurodegeneration via the inhibition of inappropriate transcription. Surprisingly, we also find
that transcriptional changes in the hippocampus are similar to Alzheimer’s disease (AD)
and frontotemporal dementia (FTD) cases, and LSD1 is specifically mislocalized to patholo-
gical protein aggregates in these cases. These data raise the possibility that pathological
aggregation could compromise the function of LSD1 in AD and FTD.

 L
SD1/KDM1a (hereafter referred to as LSD1) is an amine
oxidase histone demethylase. In conjunction with the
CoREST
complex,
it
specifically
demethylates
mono-
methylation and di-methylation of lysine 4 on histone H3
(H3K4me1/2), but not H3K4me31, 2. Alternatively, when asso-
ciated with the androgen receptor complex, LSD1 has been shown
to demethylate H3K9me23. LSD1 homozygous mutant mice
arrest at embryonic day 5.5 and fail to properly elongate the egg
cylinder, before being resorbed by embryonic day 7.54, 5. In
addition, loss of LSD1 results in olfactory receptor choice6 and
circadian rhythm defects7 when conditionally deleted in mice,
along with defects in plasma cell8 and hematopoietic differ-
entiation9 in vitro, and pituitary4, hematopoietic stem cell10 and
trophoblast stem cell11 differentiation defects in vivo. These
defects, along with developmental phenotypes in yeast8, Arabi-
dopsis12, Drosophila13, 14, and Caenorhabditis elegans15, indicate
that LSD1 may function during changes in cell fate. For example,
in mouse embryonic stem cells (ES cells), LSD1 binds to the
promoter and enhancers of the critical stem cell genes, Oct4, Sox2,
Klf4, and Myc16. Upon differentiation, LSD1 is required to
remove H3K4me1 to repress the transcription of these stem cell
genes and enable proper ES cell differentiation16. Similarly, LSD1
has also been implicated in regulating stem cell gene transcription
during the differentiation of hematopoietic stem cells10.
Although LSD1 has many roles throughout development, little
is known about its function in differentiated cells. However, one
hint comes from studies of the LSD1-containing CoREST com-
plex, which has been implicated in the maintenance of cell fate by
repressing the transcription of neuronal genes in non-neuronal
cell types17, 18. Based on this finding, we hypothesized that LSD1
may function similarly in the maintenance of other differentiated
cell types. To address this possibility, we inducibly deleted Lsd1 in
adult mice. Loss of LSD1 leads to paralysis, along with widespread
neuronal cell death in the hippocampus and cortex, and asso-
ciated learning and memory deficits. Here we have chosen to
focus on the function of LSD1 in preventing hippocampus neu-
rodegeneration, and the potential link to human neurodegen-
erative disease. In the degenerating hippocampus, we detect
transcriptional changes in pathways implicated in human neu-
rodegeneration. This suggests that LSD1 may prevent neuronal
cell death by repressing common neurodegenerative pathways.
In the degenerating neurons, we also detect the inappropriate
expression of stem cell genes. This indicates that LSD1 may be
part of an epigenetic maintenance program that continuously
prevents inappropriate transcription. Surprisingly, we also find
that LSD1 mislocalizes with pathological aggregates specifically in
Alzheimer’s disease (AD) and frontotemporal dementia (FTD)
cases, and the genome-wide transcriptional changes in the
degenerating Lsd1 hippocampus specifically correlate with those
found in AD and FTD cases. These data raise the possibility that
LSD1 function could be affected in these dementias.
Results
LSD1 is continuously required to prevent neurodegeneration.
To determine whether LSD1 is required in terminally differ-
entiated cells within the brain, we inducibly deleted Lsd1 in adult
mice by crossing floxed Lsd1 mice4, 6, 19–21 to the Cagg-Cre
tamoxifen inducible Cre transgene22–26 (hereafter referred to as
Lsd1CAGG). LSD1 is expressed widely in the mouse brain. Speci-
fically, immunofluorescence detected LSD1 protein in the nuclei
of NeuN positive neurons throughout the brain, including the
hippocampus and cerebral cortex (Supplementary Fig. 1a–l).
LSD1 protein is also present in astrocytes (Supplementary
Fig. 2a–d, i–l) and oligodendrocytes (Supplementary Fig. 3a–d,
i–l, q–t), but not microglia (Supplementary Fig. 4a–h). Tamoxifen
injection in Lsd1CAGG animals resulted in the widespread loss of
LSD1 protein in hippocampal and cerebral cortex neurons
between 4 and 9 weeks after the final injection (Fig. 1a–d).
However, surprisingly, at this time point LSD1 protein remained
unchanged in astrocytes (Supplementary Fig. 2e–h, m–p) and
oligodendrocytes
(Supplementary
Fig.
3e–h,
m–p,
u–x)
throughout the brain. Thus, within the brain, LSD1 loss is con-
fined to neurons. As a result, Lsd1CAGG animals enable us to
interrogate the result of losing LSD1 specifically in these neurons.
We do not observe any defects in non-tamoxifen-injected Cre
positive Lsd1CAGG mice, nor in tamoxifen-injected Cre minus
Lsd1CAGG littermate controls (hereafter used as controls in all
subsequent experiments). However, all (n = 45) tamoxifen-
injected Lsd1CAGG mice developed a severe motor deficit between
4 and 9 weeks after deletion, characterized initially by weakness in
the hindlimbs followed by weakness in the forelimbs. These
deficits are associated with hindlimb clasping, failure to maintain
body posture, docile behavior, an inability to keep eyes open and
ultimately, death (Fig. 1e–g, and Supplementary Movie 1 showing
the terminal phenotype used in subsequent assays). Development
of this motor defect occurred rapidly, with generally 1 week
elapsing between initial onset and full defect. Importantly, the full
motor defect occurred within 4−9 weeks after tamoxifen injection
regardless of age at Lsd1 deletion (Fig. 1g). This suggests that
LSD1 is required throughout adulthood to protect against the
development of these deficits. Though both males and females
ultimately exhibit the motor defect, the number of days after
tamoxifen injection to reach the terminal motor phenotype was
longer in males compared to females (Fig. 1g inset). It is unclear
at the moment why there is a small sex specific difference in the
timing of this defect.
To investigate this phenotype further, we examined the spinal
cords, neuromuscular junctions, muscles, and brains of Lsd1CAGG
mice. Mutant spinal cords appeared morphologically normal and
the number of motor neurons in the spinal cord did not
significantly differ from control littermates (Supplementary
Fig. 5a, b). We also did not detect any defects in the morphology
of neuromuscular junctions, or in myelination of the spinal cord
(Supplementary Fig. 5c–f). Upon examination of limb muscles,
we observed severe atrophy in the soleus muscle, as indicated by
the much smaller diameter of the muscle cells, and moderate
atrophy of the tibialis anterior muscle (Supplementary Fig. 5g–j).
However, we did not find any evidence of muscle degeneration,
suggesting the motor defect is not due to complications in
muscles.
Although, we do not detect degeneration in the spinal cord or
hindlimb muscle, we find widespread severe neurodegeneration
in the hippocampus and cerebral cortex of Lsd1CAGG mice
(Fig. 1h, i). As a result, we have initially focused here on the
function of LSD1 in preventing this neurodegeneration. Within
the hippocampus, many neuronal nuclei of the CA1, CA3,
dentate gyrus, and cerebral cortex were pyknotic, and displayed a
corresponding loss of the dendrite marker MAP2, as well as the
axon marker Tau (Fig. 1j–s). Of these hippocampal regions, the
CA1 was the most affected with 77.3 ± 5.2% pyknotic nuclei
(average with s.e.m.), while the CA2 and CA3 were moderately
affected (Supplementary Fig. 6a, b). Within individuals, the
percent of condensed nuclei in all regions of the hippocampus
was higher in the posterior of the brain and less affected
anteriorly (Supplementary Fig. 6c–f). Between individuals, the
dentate gyrus was more variably affected, with the nuclei
sometimes being completely pyknotic, completely unaffected, or
intermediately affected (Fig. 1n, o and Supplementary Fig. 6g–j).
In addition, we consistently observed pyknotic neuronal nuclei in
the cerebral cortex, amygdala, thalamus and motor cortex, though
the effect in the amygdala and thalamus was less severe than the
hippocampus or cortex. (Fig. 1h, i, p, q and Supplementary

 Fig. 6k–r). Within the cerebral cortex, most of the pyknotic nuclei
were typically found in layers II/III, IV, and VI (Supplementary
Fig. 6k, l). It is possible that the neurodegeneration in the motor
cortex contributes to the observed paralysis phenotype. However,
at the moment it is not possible to determine definitively if this is
the case. Finally, in the cerebral cortex of Lsd1CAGG mice, and to a
lesser extent in the hippocampus, we observed a strong reactive
gliosis response (Fig. 1t–w), an effect previously associated with
neuronal distress27.
To confirm that the pyknotic nuclei in the hippocampus and
cortex of Lsd1CAGG mice have undergone cell death, we
performed TUNEL. Nearly every pyknotic nucleus exhibited
positive TUNEL staining, indicating that they were undergoing or
had undergone cell death (Fig. 1x−aa). Also, the neuronal cell
death was observed at the terminal phenotype regardless of the
age of the mice when Lsd1 was inducibly deleted. These data
indicate that LSD1 is continuously required for the survival of
hippocampal and cortex neurons.

 Immunohistochemistry verified that LSD1 protein is lost in the
degenerating neurons of Lsd1CAGG mice. Specifically, LSD1 was
undetectable in most cortical nuclei and nearly all hippocampal
nuclei, including all of the pyknotic nuclei in both regions
(Fig. 1a–d). In contrast, LSD1 persisted in the remaining normal
uncondensed nuclei within these brain regions (Fig. 1b, d,
Supplementary Fig. 7a–d). The reciprocal relationship between
LSD1 protein and pyknotic nuclei indicates that the neuronal cell
death is likely due to the cell autonomous loss of LSD1. To
confirm that hippocampal neurodegeneration is cell autonomous,
we also induced deletion of Lsd1 in Lsd1CAGG mice using a single
low dose tamoxifen injection. In contrast to the widespread LSD1
protein loss that we observe in the hippocampus with multiple
higher dose tamoxifen injections (Supplementary Fig. 7a–d),
10 weeks after tamoxifen injection the low dose injection resulted
in the loss of LSD1 protein in only a small number of neurons
within the hippocampus (Supplementary Fig. 7e–f). Nevertheless,
the few neuronal nuclei that lack LSD1 still become pyknotic,
indicating that they have undergone neurodegeneration (Supple-
mentary Fig. 7e–f). These results suggest that within the
hippocampus, the neuronal cell death is cell autonomous.
Despite the severe neurodegeneration of the hippocampus and
cortex in Lsd1CAGG mice, the cerebellum appeared normal. This
can be seen, for example, by the absence of pyknotic nuclei and
the normal distribution of the dendrite marker MAP2 (Supple-
mentary Fig. 8a–d). To determine whether the lack of neuronal
cell death in this region could be due to the failure of Lsd1
deletion there, we performed quantitative PCR to assess the
extent of remaining undeleted Lsd1 in different brain regions.
This analysis demonstrated high levels of deletion in the
hippocampus and to a lesser extent in the cerebral cortex.
However, there was very little Lsd1 deletion in the cerebellum
(Supplementary Fig. 8g). Overall, the extent of deletion matches
the level of remaining LSD1 protein in each brain region at the
terminal stage, with very little LSD1 in the hippocampus, low
levels of LSD1 in the cortex, and higher levels of LSD1 in the
cerebellum (Fig. 1a–d and Supplementary Fig. 8e, f). This
distribution suggests that the brain region specificity of the
neurodegeneration in Lsd1CAGG mice may be due to the
specificity of Lsd1 deletion. Notably, though Lsd1 deletion in
the hippocampus occurred within the first 24 h after tamoxifen
injection (Supplementary Fig. 8g), the loss of LSD1 protein in the
hippocampus
occurred
much
later.
For
example,
in
the
hippocampi of mice just beginning to display hindlimb weakness
(~ 1 week before the terminal phenotype) we observed some
remaining LSD1 immunoreactivity and far fewer pyknotic nuclei
(Supplementary Fig. 8h, i). This indicates that there is slow RNA
or protein turnover in hippocampal neurons, a finding that
is consistent with the continuous requirement for LSD1 in
these cells.
Many previous mouse models of neurodegeneration display
moderate levels of neuronal loss over an extended period of time
(many months)28, 29, so the extent of neuronal cell death that we
observed in Lsd1CAGG mice within 9 weeks was striking.
Therefore, we considered the possibility that LSD1 is generally
required for cell viability. If this were the case, deletion of Lsd1
throughout the mouse would be expected to result in a similar
disruption in other organs and cell types. To address this
possibility, we examined the liver and kidneys of terminal
Lsd1CAGG mice using dual IF. Hepatocytes and nephron epithelial
cells lacking LSD1 appeared morphologically normal (Supple-
mentary Fig. 9a–l). Additionally, Purkinje neurons lacking LSD1
in the cerebellum did not display any morphological signs of cell
death despite the absence of LSD1 (Supplementary Fig. 8e, f).

 Taken together, these data suggest that LSD1 is not required for
general cell viability. This conclusion is consistent with what has
been reported in the literature elsewhere4, 6, 9–11, 16, 30. Thus, the
continuous requirement for LSD1 to prevent neuronal cell death
in the hippocampus and cortex appears to be specific to these
neurons.
Loss of LSD1 results in learning and memory defects. To
determine whether LSD1-dependent neurodegeneration leads to
learning and memory deficits, we assessed female Lsd1CAGG mice
in the Morris water maze and fear conditioning assays, 28 days
after tamoxifen injection (prior to the onset of motor defects).
Compared to littermate controls, Lsd1CAGG mice had significant
defects in the latency to mount the platform in the water maze
assay on day 5 (Fig. 2a). This is despite the fact that Lsd1CAGG
mice swam at speeds not significantly different than their litter-
mate controls (Supplementary Fig. 10a, Supplementary Movie 2).
Also, on day 5, there is an increase in overall distance traveled as
Lsd1CAGG mice swim randomly rather than locating the platform
(Supplementary Fig. 10b). Together these results suggest that the
impaired performance of Lsd1CAGG mice in the water maze is not
due to motor deficits. On day 6, when the platform was removed,
controls spent nearly half of their time swimming in the platform
quadrant, while Lsd1CAGG mice spent approximately equal time
swimming in each of the four quadrants (Fig. 2b). These data
suggest that Lsd1CAGG mice have reduced spatial learning and
reference memory capacity. Lsd1CAGG mice were also impaired
in contextual fear conditioning, spending less time freezing
(30.0 ± 8.3%
average
with
s.e.m.)
compared
to
controls
(47.9 ± 4.5% average with s.e.m.) (Fig. 2c). The contextual fear
conditioning was reduced in Lsd1CAGG mice at all points, and this
reduction was statistically significant at 120,180, and 360 s
(Fig. 2c). However, Lsd1CAGG mice froze normally in response to
a conditioned tone during cued fear conditioning (Fig. 2d). These
data suggest that Lsd1CAGG mice have defects in contextual, but
not cued, learning and memory. This specificity is consistent with
the observed pattern of neuronal cell death in the brains of these
mice. Notably, though we do not detect any evidence of visual
impairment, it is possible that a slight defect in visual impairment
also contributes to the deficit observed in the water maze and
contextual fear conditioning assays.
LSD1 inhibits re-activation of stem cell transcription. Previous
work has implicated the LSD1-containing CoREST complex in
repressing neuronal genes in non-neuronal cell types17, 18. This
raised the possibility that LSD1 may be functioning similarly in
terminally differentiated hippocampal neurons to block the
expression of genes associated with alternative cell fates. To test
this possibility, we examined hippocampal gene expression
changes in terminal Lsd1CAGG mice by RNA-seq. At this terminal
stage, there was no difference in the number of pyknotic nuclei in
Lsd1CAGG mutants vs. the number of normal nuclei in unaffected
controls, indicating that neurons in Lsd1CAGG were actively
undergoing neuronal cell death, but not yet cleared (Supple-
mentary Fig. 11a). Comparison of global gene expression by
unsupervised hierarchical clustering and principle components
analysis in two Lsd1CAGG mutants and two tamoxifen-injected
Cre minus littermate controls, showed that the expression states
were similar between biological replicates, but different between
Lsd1CAGG mutants and controls (Supplementary Fig. 11b, c and

 revealed more significantly upregulated (281) than significantly
downregulated (124) genes (Supplementary Fig. 11d, e, Supple-
mentary Data 1, FDR < 0.05).
LSD1 has previously been shown to repress the expression of
several critical stem cell genes during differentiation in multiple
stem cell populations9, 11, 16. Therefore, we hypothesized that
LSD1 may also be continuously required in terminally differ-
entiated neurons to repress the transcription of stem cell genes to
block the re-initiation of a stem cell fate. To address this
possibility, we examined the expression of stem cell genes in our

 and FOXO1 proteins were reactivated widely in the degenerating
pyknotic neurons, as well as in some of the remaining non-
condensed nuclei, but not in controls (Fig. 3e, f, i, j). In contrast,
c-MYC was reactivated only in a few nuclei (Fig. 3g, h).
Therefore, to confirm that these c-MYC positive cells are neurons,
we performed dual IF with the neuronal marker NeuN. This
analysis confirmed that c-MYC is reactivated in neuronal nuclei
(Supplementary Fig. 12a–h). Interestingly, although we did not
observe increased Oct4 expression in our RNA-seq data set
(Fig. 3d), one out of four mice analyzed displayed re-activation of
OCT4 protein throughout the pyknotic hippocampal nuclei
(Fig. 3k, l). This expression pattern appeared to be specific, as it
was not observed in any of the controls or in other brain regions
of the affected animal. These results suggest that LSD1 is
continuously required to repress the inappropriate expression of
stem cell genes in hippocampal neurons.
Among the most highly activated genes in our RNA-seq data
set we also noticed the upregulation of the neuronal stem cell
genes Vimentin and Nestin (Supplementary Fig. 12i, j). To
determine whether VIMENTIN and NESTIN may also be
reactivated in the dying neurons of Lsd1CAGG mice, we performed
IHC to detect the expression of these proteins. IHC detected
VIMENTIN protein in a subset of hippocampal neurons, though
at a higher frequency in Lsd1CAGG mice than controls, while
NESTIN protein is found in the reactive glia of the Lsd1CAGG
hippocampus and cortex (Supplementary Fig. 12k–p).
Loss of LSD1 induces common neurodegeneration pathways.
To identify additional pathways associated with the hippocampal
neuronal cell death, we also performed gene ontology (GO) and
gene set enrichment analysis (GSEA) on our RNA-seq data sets.
Among the pathways that are affected by the loss of LSD1,
we observed the upregulation of inflammatory response genes
and complement cascade genes, along with the downregulation
of oxidative phosphorylation genes and genes involved in neu-
rotransmission (ion transport) (Supplementary Fig. 11f, g). All
four of these pathways have been previously linked to neurode-
generation. For example, several studies have implicated the
inflammatory response pathway in neurodegeneration. Activation
of the inflammatory response pathway could contribute to neu-
rodegeneration via macrophage mediated phagocytosis32. There
is also evidence linking the complement cascade pathway to
neurodegeneration. Activation of the complement cascade path-
way could lead to neuronal cell death through axonal pruning33.
In addition, impaired neurotransmission could contribute to
neuronal cell death through the loss of electrical potential34.
Finally, a defect in oxidative phosphorylation, with the accom-
panying mitochondrial dysfunction, could lead to neurodegen-
eration
via
the
generation
of
reactive
oxygen
species35.
To determine the extent that these four neurodegeneration-
associated pathways are misregulated in our Lsd1CAGG hippo-
campus RNA-seq, we plotted the enrichment of these gene sets in
our data set for each of these four pathways. This analysis
demonstrated that all four of these common neurodegeneration
pathways are highly affected (Fig. 4a–d). Importantly, while
each of these pathways has been implicated in neurodegeneration,
it is difficult to determine whether these pathways contribute
to neuronal cell death, or whether they may simply be a con-
sequence of the neurodegeneration.
Lsd1CAGG expression changes overlap with AD and FTD cases.
The common neurodegeneration pathways affected by loss of
LSD1 are also affected in human neurodegeneration patients.
For example, systems biology approaches in human late onset
Alzheimer’s disease (LOAD) brains have identified a critical
microglia and immune transcription network upregulated in AD

 cases36. Interestingly, we noticed that many genes in the LOAD
microglia and immune gene signature, including the critical
receptor Tyrobp, are highly enriched in the Lsd1CAGG hippo-
campus (Supplementary Data 1). Also, many of these microglia
and immune genes are among the 281 most significantly upre-
gulated genes in our RNA-seq data set (Supplementary Data 1).
Therefore, to determine if the LOAD microglia and immune
response module is similarly misregulated in our mice, we com-
pared the expression changes in the Lsd1CAGG hippocampus to
previously published expression changes at orthologous loci in
LOAD cases36. This analysis demonstrated that loss of LSD1 in
the mouse hippocampus leads to microglia and immune response
gene expression changes that are highly similar to those that
occur in the prefrontal cortex of LOAD cases. The microglia and
immune expression changes in the Lsd1CAGG hippocampus
also highly overlap with those that occur in the frontal cortex of
FTD cases with progranulin mutations (FTD-progranulin)37
(Fig. 4e, f).
Surprisingly, a similar correlation with AD and FTD cases is
also found with the other neurodegeneration pathways that are
misregulated in our RNA-seq data set. For example, in the Kyoto
Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG) complement
cascade genes, expression changes in the Lsd1CAGG hippocampus
highly overlap with the upregulation that occurs in the prefrontal
cortex of AD and FTD cases (Fig. 4g, h). A correlation is observed
in pathways that are downregulated in the Lsd1CAGG hippocam-
pus as well. For example, we find a large overlap with expression
changes in the neurotransmission genes (Synaptic Transmission
Module)
that
were
also
identified
using
systems
biology
approaches in LOAD cases (Fig. 4k, l)36. Similarly, we observe
a high correlation with the transcriptional changes in oxidative
phosphorylation genes (Fig. 4i, j).
Finally, among the top upregulated genes in the Lsd1CAGG
hippocampus we noticed the cell cycle gene PCNA (Fig. 4m, and
Supplementary Data 1). Evidence for the potential re-initiation of
the cell cycle has been found in AD cases38. Therefore, to
determine if PCNA, and other cell cycle markers, are being
reactivated in degenerating Lsd1CAGG neurons, we performed
IHC analysis. This analysis confirmed the re-activation of PCNA
protein, along with that of another cell cycle marker, H3S10p,
specifically in the remaining non-pyknotic hippocampal nuclei
(Fig. 4n–q). Intriguingly, the observation that c-MYC, PCNA and
H3S10p were reactivated predominantly in the remaining
uncondensed nuclei of the Lsd1CAGG hippocampus raises the
possibility that these neurons may be attempting to re-initiate the
cell cycle prior to neuronal cell death.

 was unexpected. Thus, we considered the possibility that the
expression changes in our mice might overlap more broadly with
AD and FTD cases. To address this possibility, we next compared
the expression changes in the Lsd1CAGG hippocampus with the
expression
changes
in
AD
and
FTD
cases
genome-wide.
Remarkably, we found that the genome-wide expression changes
in the prefrontal cortex of LOAD cases highly correlate with the
expression changes in the hippocampus of Lsd1CAGG mice
(Fig. 5a). Likewise, the correlation was highly significant when
compared to the frontal cortex of FTD-progranulin (Fig. 5b).
The genome-wide correlation in expression changes with AD
and FTD cases could indicate the possible involvement of LSD1
in these diseases. However, it is also possible that the overlap is
being primarily driven by the consequences of neuronal cell
death. To address this second possibility, we compared the
expression changes in the Lsd1CAGG hippocampus with other
neurodegenerative diseases that have similar levels of neuronal
cell death. If the genome-wide correlation is being driven by a
common underlying mechanism, rather than neuronal cell death,
we would expect the correlation to be less significant in
these comparisons. Importantly, we observe relatively little
overlap with the expression changes in the substantia nigra of
Parkinson’s disease (PD), a region with extensive neuronal
cell death (Fig. 5c)39. We also see relatively little overlap with
the expression changes that occur in the motor neurons
of
amyotrophic
lateral
sclerosis
(ALS)
cases
(Fig.
5d)40.
Furthermore, compared with the high degree of correlation that
we observe in FTD-progranulin cases, we find a dramatic
reduction in the correlation when compared to sporadic FTD
cases, despite the fact that these sporadic FTD cases have levels of
neuronal cell death that are the same as FTD-progranulin cases
(Fig. 5g). The large decrease in gene expression overlap, that we
observe in PD, ALS, and sporadic FTD cases, suggests that the
genome-wide overlap in expression with AD and FTD cases,
is not simply due to neuronal cell death. Finally, we also
compared Lsd1CAGG hippocampus expression changes to changes
in the cerebellum of AD and FTD cases. Compared with the
prefrontal cortex, the cerebellum is relatively unaffected in AD
and FTD cases. In both AD and FTD, we find that expression
changes in the cerebellum overlap much less than the prefrontal
cortex (Fig. 5e, f). This discrepancy indicates that within AD and
FTD cases, the overlap in expression may be driven by the
neurodegeneration, rather than brain region.
LSD1 is mislocalized in human dementias. The RNA-seq data
suggest that deletion of Lsd1 alone is sufficient to recapitulate
transcriptional changes observed in the affected brain regions of
AD and FTD-progranulin cases, including many of the individual
gene categories that have previously been implicated in the
etiology of these dementias. These data potentially implicate the
loss of LSD1 function in these human dementias. As a result, we
wondered whether LSD1 might be affected in AD and FTD
patients. AD is characterized by protein aggregates of amyloid β
(Aβ) and Tau, while FTD is associated with aggregates of either
Tau or Tar DNA binding protein 43 (TDP-43)41–43. These
pathological aggregates are thought to lead to downstream
pathways of neurodegeneration, but it remains unclear mechan-
istically how these aggregates are linked to neuronal cell death.
To determine whether LSD1 may be affected in AD and FTD
patients, we examined the localization of LSD1 in post-mortem
AD, FTD with TDP-43 inclusions (FTD-TDP43), and age-
matched control cases. We also examined the localization of
LSD1 in Parkinson’s disease (PD) cases, as a disease control with
pathological protein aggregates. Similar to the expression in mice,
LSD1 immunoreactivity was found in neuronal nuclei throughout
the frontal cortex and hippocampus of age-matched control cases
(Fig. 6a, b). In contrast, in all 14 AD cases analyzed, LSD1 was
found both in neuronal nuclei as well as inappropriately
associated with cytoplasmic tangle-like aggregates and neurites,
(Fig.
6c,
d).
This
pattern
is
highly
reminiscent
of
the
neurofibrillary tangles and neuropil threads marked by pTau in
the same AD cases (Fig. 6c–f). In addition, in all 14 FTD-TDP43
cases analyzed, LSD1 was abnormally associated with neurites in
the frontal cortex, and cytoplasmic inclusions in the hippocampus
(Fig. 6j, k). This pattern is highly similar to the pTDP-43
aggregation
observed
in
FTD-TDP43
cases
(Fig.
6j–m).
To confirm the co-localization of LSD1 with pTau and pTDP-
43 we performed dual IF. This analysis demonstrated that LSD1
co-localizes with pTau in 56.3% of neurofibrillary tangles in
AD (n = 14 patients), and with pTDP-43 in 52.4% of neurites in
FTD-TDP43 (n = 5 patients) (Fig. 6g–i, n–q). Within AD cases
the extent of co-localization ranges from 19 to 76%, while in
FTD-TDP43 cases, the co-localization ranges from 43 to 71%.
The finding that LSD1 is localized to pathological aggregates
raises the possibility that it could be increasingly sequestered in
the cytoplasm. This could result in less LSD1 being available to
function in the nucleus of affected neurons in AD and FTD cases.
To confirm the specificity of the LSD1 localization, we
performed several controls. Preincubation of the LSD1 Antibody
(Ab) with its target LSD1 peptide completely abrogated the
immunoreactivity (Supplementary Fig. 13a, b). We also did not
observe the localization of LSD1 to the amyloid β core of senile
plaques in the same AD cases where we observed co-localization
with pTau (Supplementary Fig. 13c, d). Nor do we observe LSD1
localized to any Lewy body-like structures (aggregates of
α-synuclein), or any other abnormal localization of LSD1, in
the substantia nigra of PD cases (Supplementary Fig. 13e–h).
These results suggest the mislocalization of LSD1 to neurofi-
brillary tangles in AD, and pTDP-43 inclusions in FTD cases, is
specific. Notably, the co-localization of proteins with these
pathological aggregates is exceedingly rare. For example, though
many proteins have been recently described as enriched in
the insoluble fraction of AD brains, only one was confirmed to be
co-localized with neurofibrillary tangles44.
Lsd1CAGG mice do not have protein aggregates. Since LSD1
associates with pathological aggregates in AD and FTD-TDP43
cases, we considered the possibility that the neuronal cell death
that we observe in the Lsd1CAGG mice could be due to the
induction of pathological aggregates in the mice. To test this
possibility, we performed IHC on the brains of terminal
Lsd1CAGG mice using antibodies to Aβ, pTau, and pTDP-43,
along with Gallyas (silver, nonspecific aggregates) staining (Sup-
plementary Fig. 14a–h). We find no evidence of any pathological
protein aggregates or tangles associated with the degenerating
neurons or otherwise. This suggests that if loss of LSD1
is involved in AD and/or FTD, it is likely downstream of
pathological aggregation. This finding is consistent with the
mislocalization of LSD1 to pathological aggregates in the human
cases (Fig. 6).
Increased stem cell gene expression in AD and FTD patients.
The loss of LSD1 in mice is associated with the surprising
re-activation of stem cell transcription in hippocampal neurons.
If LSD1 is affected in AD and/or FTD, these diseases could be
associated with a similar increase in stem cell gene expression.
To test this possibility, we re-examined the expression of stem
cell genes in previously published microarray experiments from
LOAD and FTD-progranulin post-mortem cases36, 37. This ana-
lysis revealed a significant increase in the expression of Klf4, Myc,

 Oct4, Foxo1, and Vimentin in LOAD cases compared to controls
(Supplementary Fig. 15a, c, e, g, k), while PCNA expression was
unchanged (Supplementary Fig. 15i). In FTD-progranulin cases
there was also a significant increase in the expression of Klf4 and
Foxo1, as well as a trend toward the increased expression of Myc,
Oct4, PCNA, and Vimentin (Supplementary Fig. 15b, d, f, h, j, l).
These data are consistent with the possibility that LSD1 function
could be compromised in AD and FTD patients.
Discussion
Despite its well-known role throughout development, LSD1
protein can also be found in terminally differentiated cells
throughout the brain. To determine whether there is an ongoing
role for LSD1 in these terminally differentiated cells, we con-
ditionally deleted Lsd1 in adult mice. Surprisingly, within the
brain at the terminal time point, the inducible loss of LSD1 in
Lsd1CAGG mice results in loss of LSD1 protein only in neurons.
This indicates that neurons may be more vulnerable to LSD1
protein or RNA turnover, a specificity that mirrors what occurs in
AD and FTD cases.
Within the brain, the selective vulnerability of neurons in
Lsd1CAGG mice enables us to specifically interrogate the function
of LSD1 in these cells. Loss of LSD1 in Lsd1CAGG mice results in
widespread hippocampus and cortex neuronal cell death. This
demonstrates that loss of LSD1 in hippocampus and cortex
neurons is sufficient to induce neuronal cell death. This conclu-
sion is consistent with our high/low tamoxifen mosaic experi-
ments, which indicate that LSD1 acts cell autonomously in
hippocampal neurons. Thus, we propose that LSD1 functions
continuously in hippocampal and cortex neurons to prevent
neurodegeneration.
To further investigate the neuronal cell death in the hippo-
campus, we examined gene expression changes genome-wide.
Previous
analyses
of
human
neurodegeneration
cases
and
experimental models have implicated common pathways leading
to neuronal cell death. These include; activation of genes in the
microglia and immune pathways, a defect in oxidative phos-
phorylation, loss of synaptic transmission, and failure to maintain
cell cycle arrest. Remarkably, the loss of LSD1 affects all of these
common neurodegenerative pathways. Therefore, it is possible
that the loss of LSD1 creates a perfect storm where multiple
neurodegenerative pathways are affected simultaneously, with
one or more of these pathways leading to the observed neuronal
cell death.
The prevailing view in developmental biology is that cells are
irreversibly committed to their differentiated cell fate. Indeed, the
very word “fate” promotes the idea that a differentiated cell has
reached its final destiny. However, there may be a requirement
for differentiated cells to actively maintain their differentiated
status. The LSD1-containing CoREST complex has been pre-
viously implicated in repressing neuronal genes in non-neuronal
cells17, 18. Based on this, we considered the possibility that LSD1
could be similarly required to maintain terminally differentiated
hippocampus and cortex neurons by repressing gene transcrip-
tion associated with alternative cell fates. In the degenerating
neurons of Lsd1CAGG mice, we detect the re-activation of stem
cell transcription factors, such as KLF4, OCT4, c-MYC and
FOXO1. This demonstrates that LSD1 is continuously required in
terminally differentiated neurons to block the re-activation of
these factors. Also, we detect a widespread decrease in the
expression of neuronal pathways. This suggests that LSD1 is also
required, directly or indirectly, to maintain the expression of
these genes. Therefore, we propose that LSD1 is a key component
of an epigenetic maintenance program that reinforces the
differentiated state of hippocampal neurons by continuously
restraining the re-activation of factors associated with alternative
cell fates.
At this moment, we cannot definitively determine why the loss
of LSD1 results in a severe motor defect. Nevertheless, Lsd1CAGG
mice develop a motor defect that is similar to a tauopathy mouse
model28. For example the P301S mice, which overexpress an
aggregation prone form of human Tau, have a motor defect that
is reminiscent of Lsd1CAGG mice28. The concordance of pheno-
types between P301S mice and Lsd1CAGG mice is consistent with
Tau and LSD1 acting in a common pathway. Also consistent with
this possibility, we find that that LSD1 inappropriately mis-
localizes to cytoplasmic aggregates of pTau in AD, and global
gene expression changes in the degenerating Lsd1CAGG hippo-
campus correlate with changes in AD and FTD-progranulin
cases. Finally, the re-examination of stem cell genes that are
specifically affected by the loss of LSD1 in the mouse hippo-
campus demonstrates that these genes are also increased in AD
and FTD cases. Together these data indicate a potential link
between the loss of LSD1 and these human dementia cases. This
could occur through the following potential model: as neurons
age, the accumulation of protein aggregates sequesters LSD1 in
the cytoplasm, and interferes with the continuous requirement for
LSD1. Normally, LSD1 maintains terminally differentiated neu-
rons, and prevents the activation of common neurodegenerative
pathways,
by
continuously
repressing
the
transcription
of
inappropriate genes. As a result, the inhibition of LSD1 by the
pathological aggregates in the aging neurons of AD and FTD
brains creates a situation where neurons are subject to an
onslaught of detrimental processes. This results in neuronal cell
death and dementia.

approved by and conducted in accordance with the Emory University Institutional
Animal Care and Use Committee. Mice were intraperitoneally injected with
75.0 mg tamoxifen per kilogram of body mass dissolved in corn oil once a day on
days 1, 2, 4, 5, and 7 of a 7 day period. This injection protocol was used for all
assays, except the single low dose tamoxifen injection, which was performed with
1 mg tamoxifen per 40 g of body mass.
Mouse tissue fixation. Mice were given a lethal dose of isoflurane via inhalation,
then transcardially perfused with ice-cold 4.0% paraformaldehyde in 0.1 M phos-
phate buffer. Brain, spinal cord and muscle tissues were dissected and post fixed in
cold paraformaldehyde solution for 2 h. Tissues were then either cryoprotected by
sinking in 30% sucrose and frozen embedded in O.C.T. Compound (Tissue Tek),
or serially dehydrated and embedded in paraffin.
Histology. For hematoxylin and eosin, and thionin staining was performed
according standard procedures (1% thionin, pH4.0). For Gallyas staining, sections
were dewaxed then treated with 5% periodic acid for 5 min, followed by washing
and 1 min alkaline silver treatment. Sections were then developed for 30 min,
followed by 0.5% acetic acid and water rinses. Finally, sections were treated with
Schiff’s reagent for 30 min, washed, counterstained with hematoxylin and
coverslipped.
Mouse immunofluorescence. Frozen mouse brain tissue was sectioned at 12 µm
and washed with TBS, then treated with 0.8% sodium borohydride for 10 min to
reduce background. Antigen retrieval was performed by microwaving at 10%
power 3X for 5 min in 0.01 M sodium citrate. Slides were then cooled and washed
with TBS, then permeabilized in 0.5% Triton X-100 for 20 min, followed by
blocking in 10% goat serum for 1 h. Primary Abs (Supplementary Table 1) were
incubated overnight at 4 °C. Slides were then washed and incubated in secondary
Abs (Goat α Mouse Alexa Fluor 488, 1:500, Invitrogen A11001 and Goat α Rabbit
Alexa Fluor 594, 1:500, Invitrogen A11012) for 1 h at room temperature followed
by washes with TBS and DAPI, then coverslipped.
Mouse immunohistochemistry. Paraffin embedded tissue was dewaxed with
xylenes and serial ethanol dilutions then treated with 3% hydrogen peroxide at
40 °C for 5 min to quench endogenous peroxidase activity, blocked in 2% serum at
40 °C for 15 min, and incubated with primary Ab (Supplementary Table 1) over-
night at 4 °C. Slides were washed then incubated with biotinylated secondary Ab
(Biotinylated Goat α Rabbit, 1:200, Vector Labs BA-1000 and Biotinylated Goat α

 Mouse, 1:200, Vector Labs BA-9200) at 37 °C for 30 min. Signal amplification was
then carried out by incubating at 37 °C for 1 h with Vector Labs Elite ABC reagent
(PK-6200). Slides were then developed with DAB for 2–5 min, counterstained with
hematoxylin and coverslipped.
Human immunohistochemistry. The post-mortem human samples were provided
by the Alzheimer’s Disease Research Center (ADRC) Brain Bank at Emory Uni-
versity and were obtained with signed informed consent in accordance with
institutional guidelines.
Frozen free floating sections of 20–50 µm thickness were washed of
cryoprotectant followed by quenching of endogenous peroxidase activity by
incubating in 3% hydrogen peroxide for 15 min. Sections were permeabilized and
blocked in 0.1 Triton X-100 and 8% goat serum, then incubated with primary Abs
(Supplementary Table 1) overnight at 4 °C followed by incubation with biotinylated
secondary Ab (Biotinylated Goat α Rabbit, 1:200, Vector Labs BA-1000 and
Biotinylated Goat α Mouse, 1:200, Vector Labs BA-9200) and amplification with
Vector Labs Elite ABC reagent. Sections were then treated with DAB (Sigma) for
3–4.5 min then mounted on slides, dried overnight and serially dehydrated and
coverslipped with Permount.
Human immunofluorescence. For immunofluorescence, sections were prepared
as with IHC, except that tissue was incubated with two primary antibodies
(Supplementary Table 1) overnight, and with two secondary antibodies, fluorescent
goat anti-mouse (1:500, Invitrogen A11001) and biotinylated goat anti-rabbit
(1:200, Vector Labs BA-1000). Fluorescent signal amplification of the biotinylated
secondary was carried out with Vector Labs Elite ABC reagent and developed with
PerkinElmer TSA Plus Cyanine 3 System diluted 1:100. Sections were treated with
autofluorescence inhibitor (Millipore 2160) after mounting on slides.
Immunohistochemistry with peptide block. For peptide block, the LSD1 primary
antibody (1:500, Abcam 17721) was preincubated for 24 h at 4 °C with 74-fold
molar excess of target peptide (Abcam 17763).
TUNEL assay. Frozen embedded brain tissue was sectioned at 12 µm thickness.
Slides were permeabilized in 0.1% Triton X-100, 0.1% sodium citrate for 2 min
followed by washes in PBS. For antigen retrieval, slides were microwaved for 1 min
at 10% power in preboiled 0.1 M sodium citrate then rapidly cooled by adding
deionized water. Slides were then washed in PBS and blocked for 30 min at room
temperature in 0.1 M Tris, 3.0% BSA, 10% goat serum. Slides were washed twice
then incubated with 50 µL of TUNEL labeling solution (Roche In situ Cell Death
Detection Kit, Fluorescein) for 1 h at 37 °C. Slides were then washed with PBS and
DAPI (0.5 mg/ml) then coverslipped.
Neuromuscular junctions. Frozen tibialis anterior tissue was sectioned at 20 µm
and blocked with 10% goat serum for 1 h. Slides were then incubated with SV2
primary antibody (1:50, Developmental Studies Hybridoma Bank) in blocking
buffer for 72, replacing antibody every 24 h. Slides were then washed and incubated
with secondary antibody (1:500, Invitrogen A11001) for 2 h, washed, then incu-
bated with rhodamine conjugated α-bungarotoxin (Life Technologies T-1175) for
1 h, washed and coverslipped.
Quantification of LSD1 co-localization with pTau and pTDP-43. Three random
fields per section that contained NFTs marked by pTau at 20X and pTDP-43
inclusions at 40X were manually examined. Beginning with the pTau/pTDP-43
fluorescence channel, each aggregate structure was visually inspected. Then, the
microscope was switched to the LSD1 fluorescence channel and inspected for
LSD1 signal. Structures were scored as positive for LSD1 co-localization if the
LSD1 staining pattern was localized to a majority of the aggregate structure. 535
NFTs and 103 pTDP inclusions were scored.
Motor neuron counting. Thionin stained spinal cord sections were imaged and
cropped to include just the ventral horn. Motor neurons were manually counted by
appearance for each image then calculated as a percent of the total number of
nuclei, which were counted by converting the image to binary then counting
particles using ImageJ.
CA1 nuclei counting. Hematoxylin or DAPI stained nuclei of hippocampal sec-
tions were scored as normal, pyknotic, or intermediate. Counts were limited to the
most dorsal region of the CA1 in the field of a Zeiss Axiophot ocular graticule grid.
Three randomly selected sections were counted per animal. Investigator was blind
to genotype.
Lsd1 deletion quantification. Intact Lsd1 alleles from hippocampus, cortex, and
cerebellum were quantified from phenol extracted genomic DNA using BioRad
CFX96 Real-Time System using the following primers: Lsd1 forward: 5′-CCAAC
ACTAAAGAGTATCCCAAGAATA-3′; Lsd1 reverse: 5′-GGTGATTATTATAGG
TTCAGGTGTTTC-3′; Actb forward: 5′-AGCCAACTTTACGCCTAGCGT-3′;
Actb reverse: 5′-TCTCAAGATGGACCTAATACGGC-3′. The Lsd1 reverse primer
anneals to exon 6 of Lsd1, which is deleted in Lsd1CAGG. Results were normalized
to Actb.
Morris water maze. Training was carried out in a round, water-filled tub (52 inch
diameter). Mice were trained with 4 trials per day for 5 days with a maximum trial
length of 60 s and a 15 min intertrial interval. Subjects that did not reach the
platform in the allotted time were manually guided to it. Mice were allowed 5 s on
the platform to survey spatial cues. Following the 5 day training period, probe trials
were performed by removing the escape platform and measuring the amount of
time spent in the quadrant that originally contained the escape platform over a 60 s
trial. All trials were videotaped and performance analyzed by means of MazeScan
(Clever Sys, Inc.).
Fear conditioning. On day 1, mice were placed in a fear conditioning apparatus
(Colbourn) and allowed to explore for 3 min. Following this habituation period,
three conditioned stimulus-unconditioned stimulus pairings were presented with a
1 min intertrial interval. The conditioned stimulus consisted of a 20 s 85db tone
and the unconditioned stimulus consisted of a 2 s foot shock that co-terminated
with each conditioned stimulus. On day 2, subjects were presented with a context
test by placement in day 1 conditioning apparatus and amount of freezing behavior
was recorded by camera and quantified by Colbourn software. On day 3, subjects
were presented with a tone test by exposure to conditioned stimulus in a novel
context. Mice were allowed to explore novel context for 2 min then presented with
the 85 db tone for 6 min with freezing behavior recorded.
RNA sequencing. Mice were anesthetized with a lethal dose of isoflurane, followed
by decapitation and hippocampus dissection. Hippocampi were snap frozen with
liquid nitrogen in 1 mL trizol and stored at −80 °C. For RNA isolation, samples
were thawed at 37 °C then kept on ice prior to homogenization with a Polytron
homogenizer with a 5 s pulse. After a 5 min incubation at room temperature,
one tenth the sample volume of 1-bromo-3chloropropane was added, mixed by
inversion and incubated for three minutes at room temperature. Samples were then
centrifuged at 13,000×g for 15 min at 4 °C to separate the aqueous and organic
layers. As much of the aqueous layer was recovered as possible, then RNA was
precipitated with isopropanol. Pellets were then washed with 75% ethanol and
resuspended in 50 µL deionized water. RNA library preparation and sequencing
were performed by HudsonAlpha Genomic Services Lab. RNA was Poly(A)
selected and 300 bp size selected. Libraries were sequenced for 25 million 50 bp
paired-end reads.
RNA-seq analysis. Short read FASTQ files were quality trimmed using FASTX
toolkit (v. 0.0.14) to trim three bases from the 5′ end of the reads. Paired-end reads
were then mapped to the mm9 genome using tophat245 and the UCSC knownGene
gtf file. The following parameters were used in the tophat2 call “-N 1 –g 1 –read-
gap-length 1 –mate-inner-dis 170”. Reads that had the same starting location and
strand with mate-pairs that also had the same location and strand were considered
to be PCR duplicates and removed from subsequent analyses using Picard tools
(v. 1.103). Differentially expressed transcripts were determined using Cufflinks and
Cuffdiff (v2.1.1)46. Downstream analyses were performed in R/Bioconductor47 and
used gene summarized expression levels normalized using Fragments Per Kilobase
per Million (FPKM) from Cufflinks. Hierarchical clustering was performed using
the pvclust R package were significance was determined using bootstrapping48.
Principle Components Analysis (PCA) was conducted using the “prcomp” function
of the stats package in R/ Bioconductor. Enriched gene ontologies were determined
using the package “GOstats” (v. 3.1.1)49. Gene Set Enrichment Analysis (GSEA)
was performed using a pre-ranked gene list determined by cuffdiff and GSEA
(v. 2.1.0)50. Hierarchical clustering of gene expression data was performed using
average clustering in the heatmap.2 package. UCSC-style display of gene expression
data were plotted using the “rtracklayer” package51 and custom R scripts to display
RNA sequencing reads as histograms (available upon request)52.
Comparison to human gene expression data. Normalized gene expression data
from LOAD36, FTD37, and PD39 patients were downloaded from Gene Expression
Omnibus gene sets GSE44772, GSE13162 and GSE20295, respectively. Comparison
to Lsd1CAGG gene expression data was performed by mapping mouse and human
genes using the NCBI homologene database53. Correlation of Lsd1CAGG gene
expression changes and those found in LOAD, FTD, and PD patients were assessed
using Spearman’s rank correlation (ρ). P-values were determined by analysis of
variance (ANOVA).
Data availability. FastQ files for RNA sequencing experiments can be found in the
GEO data set GSE98875.
