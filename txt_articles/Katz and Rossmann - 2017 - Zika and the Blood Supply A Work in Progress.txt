 Zika and the Blood Supply
A Work in Progress
Louis M. Katz, MD; Susan N. Rossmann, MD, PhD
� Zika virus can be transmitted by transfusion, but the
harm caused to recipients is not clear in most cases. It is
very likely that the virus could also be transmitted by
transplanted organs. Sensitivity to the risk from transfusion
is elevated by consideration of possible severe neurologic
damage in fetuses. Strategies for dealing with transfusion
risk vary with the presence of Zika in the region. In
nonendemic areas, risks can be reduced by excluding
donors who have exposure through travel or sexual contact
with someone at risk. In both endemic and nonendemic
areas, the risk can be further reduced by nucleic acid
testing of donors, or pathogen reduction of platelet and
plasma products. The real risk to the population depends
on the frequency of infection as well as the efficacy of
these interventions. The interventions chosen will depend
on the risk assessment for any situation; in the United
States at this time, a combination of travel deferrals,
testing, and, to a lesser extent, pathogen reduction is being
used, but universal testing of US blood donors under
investigational use has been mandated by the US Food and
Drug Administration, beginning with states most at risk of
local transmission. Canada is largely using travel deferrals.
A precautionary approach may be taken; however, a
formal decision-making framework has been suggested.
The situation globally is clearly very fluid, as the epidemic
continues to spread and we continue to learn how to best
protect recipients of blood and transplants.

classic
transfusion-transmitted
infections
(TTIs),
hepatitis B, human immunodeficiency virus (HIV),
and hepatitis C, are chronic infections transmitted person-
to-person by a set of well-understood routes and behaviors.
As such, we have attempted for years to reduce their impact
on blood safety by donor behavior screening, examination,
and testing.1 In contrast, the threat of acute arboviral
infections to transfusion safety was not appreciated until
after the introduction of West Nile Virus (WNV) into the
United States in 1999. It spread widely in the Western
Hemisphere during several years, and in 2002 a model was
published suggesting a risk of transfusing blood from
viremic donors.2 At almost the same time, a case report
described both transmission of WNV by transfusion from an
asymptomatic donor to a trauma victim and then from that
patient/organ donor to several recipients through the
transplanted organs.3,4 The blood community, in collabora-
tion with test manufacturers and the US Food and Drug
Administration (FDA), responded to WNV with donor
deferrals for symptoms, product quarantines and, most
effectively, the development and deployment of blood donor
nucleic acid testing (NAT) for WNV RNA, less than 1 year
after recognition of the first transmissions.5 Subsequently,
dengue, chikungunya, and Zika viruses have been evaluated
as possible threats to transfusion safety.6 Zika virus has
engaged the transfusion medicine community during 2016
because of its explosive spread in the Americas, and because
it has been associated with serious morbidity. Zika virus
fulfills the major criteria for suspicion that it may be a TTI6:
(1) the agent can be present in the blood of a healthy donor,
(2) the agent is infectious by the parenteral route, (3) the
agent survives modern processing and storage conditions
for blood components, and (4) the agent causes recogniz-
able and significant morbidity.
Most Zika virus infections (»80%) are asymptomatic,7 but
infection of pregnant women is causally associated with
serious congenital injury of the fetus and newborn,8 and a
broader group of patients may develop Guillain-Barr´
e
syndrome.9 The risk of these serious outcomes has provoked
aggressive responses from both the AABB10,11 and the
FDA.12–15
VIROLOGY AND DISTRIBUTION
Zika is a flavivirus related to dengue virus at the
sequence level. It is enveloped with a 10.7-kb, positive-
sense RNA genome. The virus was isolated from a febrile
rhesus macaque in 1947 during yellow fever surveillance
studies in the canopy of the Zika forest in Uganda. It is

 pathogenic and neurotropic in animal models.16 Zika was
subsequently recovered from Aedes africanus mosquitoes.
Multiple species of Aedes support replication of Zika and
may contribute to the enzootic maintenance of infection:
their relative roles in transmission to and among humans
are unknown, but Aedes aegypti (the most important vector
for dengue, chikungunya, and yellow fever) is thought to
be the major vector in the Americas. Aedes albopictus,
hensilii, and polynesiensis are also known to be able to
transmit Zika virus.17 Monkeys and humans appear to be
the only vertebrate hosts for Zika in nature, in contrast to
WNV, whose amplification in diverse migratory bird
populations contributed to its explosive spread in the
Americas after its introduction in 1999.
Pathogenicity, as a febrile rash illness, was recognized
later, in sporadic infections in Africa and South Asia.18 The
infection was felt to be trivial, and extensive research
waited for the explosive outbreaks in the Federated States
of Micronesia (Yap Island) and French Polynesia, charac-
terized by serologic (not necessarily clinical) attack rates of
73% and 66%, respectively,7,19 during the 2007 and 2013–
2014 epidemics. Later, an association with Guillain-Barr´
e
syndrome was established in French Polynesia that saw a
20-fold
increase
in
cases
associated
with
the
Zika
epidemic.9,20
Introduction into the Americas occurred in 2013 according
to molecular clock data,21 but the disease was not identified
clinically until 2015, in Brazil.22 Even when the large
Brazilian outbreak was recognized, interest was initially
tempered by the assumed mild nature of the clinical
infection. This changed in fall 2015, when temporal and
geographic associations of the epidemic with an increased
rate of microcephaly in infants born to infected pregnant
women were recognized.23 These observations were subse-
quently extended to multiple countries.24
Since establishing itself in Brazil, Zika has spread to a
large number of countries in Latin America and the
Caribbean.25 Cases in US states to date (October 12,
2016) include 3807 travel-associated cases, 32 sexual
transmissions, a single laboratory-acquired infection, and
128 local vector-borne transmissions. In US territories,
there have been 25 871 locally acquired infections (25 355
in Puerto Rico) and 84 travel cases.26 The primary vector A
aegypti is present in the southern tier of states especially,
whereas A albopictus can be found even further north in the
continental United States.27 Unfortunately, we are not
entirely sure of the current distribution of these vectors
because surveillance is incomplete. The presence of vectors
and the historical occurrence of limited outbreaks of
dengue and chikungunya in the continental United States
and Hawaii, also spread primarily by A aegypti, have raised
concern about autochthonous vector-borne Zika infection
with subsequent transfusion transmission from asymp-
tomatically infected blood donors.28–30 Local vector-borne
transmission of Zika has occurred in very restricted areas in
South Florida31,32; the Florida Department of Health
reports 153 cases as of publication, but many of the
infected individuals were asymptomatic and found only in
surveillance. The index patient was infected during travel
to an endemic country. In response to the investigations in
South Florida, the FDA advised US blood centers on July
27, 2016, to begin application of requirements in prior
guidance (see below).33
NONVECTOR TRANSMISSION
In addition to vector-borne infection, Zika is transmitted
sexually (32 US cases reported to the Centers for Disease
Control and Prevention [CDC] to date), primarily from
infected males but at least once from an infected female,34
vertically from mother to fetus, and by accidental laboratory
exposure.35 Zika virus has been detected in breast milk36 and
saliva,37 but the clinical relevance of these observations is
unclear. There are reports from Utah of apparent Zika
transmission to a family member/caregiver of a patient,
infected during travel to an endemic country, who had a
very high titer of virus.38,39
MICROCEPHALY
Conclusive evidence demonstrates that Zika virus is
transmitted from an infected mother to the fetus during
pregnancy and causes fetal loss, microcephaly, and other
congenital neurologic syndromes.8 Microcephaly is only one
among a spectrum of adverse outcomes that characterize the
congenital Zika virus syndrome.40 Zika viral RNA has been
recovered from amniotic fluid, placenta, and fetal brains; in
vitro, Zika virus impairs growth in human neurospheres and
brain organoids, models for the neurotropism of this virus.41
Of 7830 suspected cases of congenital Zika virus syndrome
reported in Brazil, investigations of 1501 live-born infants
were completed by the Ministry of Health as of February 27,
2016; a total of 602 cases (40%) were classified as definitely
or probably Zika virus associated.40 Several newborn babies
with abnormalities were identified by neuroimaging despite
normal-sized heads, demonstrating that microcephaly is
only one manifestation of the congenital Zika syndrome. A
case control study from Rio de Janeiro showed that fetal
abnormalities occurred in 12 of 42 Zika virus–positive
women studied, with infections acquired during all 3
pregnancy trimesters.42 Fetal abnormalities varied by week
of gestation as identified by ultrasound; pathologic change
during embryogenesis occurred at the earliest stages, but
central nervous system abnormalities and most notably
intrauterine growth restriction occurred at later gestational
ages. A subsequent report suggests that the association of
infection with microcephaly is highest in the first trimester
and lower in the second and third trimesters.43 In light of
these observations, long-term follow-up of infants born to
infected
mothers
is
needed
to
fully
characterize
the
spectrum of congenital Zika infection and to assess the risk
of transmission, via vector-borne or other routes, including
transfusion, during the second and third trimesters, and the
risk to neonates and infants with developing central nervous
systems. The frequency of microcephalic infants among
mothers infected during the first trimester was estimated at
0.95% in a retrospective study in French Polynesia.44 A
much larger study in Bahia, Brazil, estimated this rate as
ranging from 0.88% to 13% depending on the underlying
estimates of infection rate and the accuracy of identification
of the disease.43 Several cases of Zika-related microcephaly
have been identified in the continental United States, with
all attributed to travel-associated maternal infection.
TRANSFUSION RISK
In French Polynesia, 2.8% of otherwise qualified (ie,
asymptomatic) blood donors had circulating viral RNA by
polymerase chain reaction.45 This observation first raised the
issue of transfusion transmission of Zika virus. Transmis-
sions to 4 recipients from 3 blood donors, who were well on
86

Zika and the Blood Supply—Katz & Rossmann
 the day of donation but who subsequently reported illness
consistent with Zika virus infection, have appeared in
various media. Two transmissions to 3 recipients have been
published from Brazil.46,47 None of the recipients had signs
or symptoms that could be credibly related to Zika infection.
These observations have resulted in consideration of how to
mitigate the risk of TTI from blood donors.
Zika plasma viremia is believed to last 1 to 2 weeks,
consistent
with
WNV
and
dengue,
which
are
both
flaviviruses, and chikungunya, an alphavirus. A review and
pooled analysis of 22 symptomatic Zika cases projected viral
clearance in 95% of patients by 19 days (95% confidence
interval, 13–80 days).48 Zika virus RNA appears to persist for
a longer interval in whole blood compared with serum or
plasma; follow-up testing of 5 individuals yielded detectable
RNA in whole blood from 5 to 58 days after symptom onset
despite RNA-negative findings in corresponding serum
samples.49 Also, urine samples in this study were RNA
positive from 5 to 26 days. It is well documented that Zika
virus and RNA persist in urine and semen longer than in
plasma. After 5 days, 82% of clinical cases remained RNA
positive from urine but not serum.50 Zika RNA (not
culturable virus) detection in semen for up to 188 days after
symptom appearance has been reported from returning
travelers.51–53 The clinical significance of this persistence is
unknown, but similar findings with WNV have not been
associated with late transfusion transmissions from blood
donors who have negative plasma RNA in routine donor
screening.54 The persistence of Zika virus RNA in urine and
other tissues likewise has unknown significance but has led,
out of precaution, to relevant standards for organ and tissue
donors.14
The risk of collecting a Zika viremic blood donation in the
United States is the sum of the risks of viremia in
asymptomatic donors infected during travel to epidemic
foci, plus that from asymptomatic donors infected by
autochthonous mosquito-borne infection, plus that from
asymptomatic sexually infected donors and from other rare
routes of transmission (eg, to caregivers). Accurate models
of this aggregate risk are not yet available in the absence of
an understanding of critical model parameters. Although it
is clear that approximately 80% of infections are subclinical,
incomplete ascertainment and reporting of clinical illness
means that we cannot really make any precise extrapolation
to the total number of infected donors. Further, early case
report data cited above suggest that a substantial proportion
of TTIs may be asymptomatic, so the clinical burden from
transfusion may be difficult to recognize. Early models have
been put forward, as discussed below.
A total of 56 cases of possible autochthonous vector-
borne transmission are being investigated in South Florida
at the time of this writing.31,55 These cases are associated
with some risk that donor infection and asymptomatic
viremia will pose a risk for transfusion transmission. Data on
vector-borne dengue and chikungunya infections in the
United States, viruses transmitted by the same Aedes
vectors, should be informative about the characteristics of
Zika transmission. Sporadic small outbreaks of chikungunya
and dengue are well documented in Florida, Texas, and
Hawaii, but sustained transmission is not generally recog-
nized.28–30 This is probably due to demographic and
epidemiologic circumstances that do not obtain in areas
sustaining explosive epidemics. These variables include
population densities, vector densities, mosquito surveillance
and control strategies, and the presence of infrastructure,
such as screens and air conditioning, that reduces popula-
tion exposure to infected vectors, even when they are
present. In 2014, local spread of chikungunya was identified
in South Florida, where a total of 12 locally acquired cases
were recognized (in the context of 2799 cases in the United
States
associated with travel to
areas with epidemic
chikungunya).29 No local transmission has subsequently
been described. Most recent dengue cases in the continental
states were acquired elsewhere by travelers or immigrants,
but there has been some activity in Hawaii, Florida
(especially Key West), and Texas (especially the Rio Grande
Valley). By far the largest recent outbreak is in Hawaii,
where 264 cases were reported between September 11,
2015, and March 17, 2016.30
Transfusion transmission of chikungunya has never been
reported. Recognition of transfusion-transmitted dengue is
rare, but it appears that it is often subclinical and may occur
more often than is recognized. In a linked donor-recipient
study during a large epidemic in Brazil, more than 0.5% of
donations were viremic, and 16 viremic units were given to
16 susceptible recipients, resulting in 6 possible or probable
TTIs. The infected transfusion recipients could not be
distinguished clinically from uninfected controls.56 The very
limited data available for Zika transfusion transmissions in
Brazil seem to be consistent with the dengue experience that
clinical morbidity is not universal when exposure via
transfusion occurs.
RISK MITIGATION STRATEGIES
When the public thinks of blood safety, the first question
often is: ‘‘Aren’t you testing for that?’’ In fact, testing is only
one of several strategies that can be used to reduce the risk
of a TTI. Several other approaches are available and may be
easier to implement quickly, may be more effective, or may
be more cost-effective. Many agents can be addressed
through a combination of activities.
Conservative Transfusion
When discussing adverse effects from transfusion it is
worth noting the obvious fact that the safest transfusion is
the one that is not given. Decreasing blood use in the
United States is well documented.57 This seems primarily in
response to the demonstration, in many studies, that clinical
outcomes with conservative transfusion appear equivalent
to those with liberal transfusion,58 but economic consider-
ations may also have contributed. Unnecessary transfusion
causes unnecessary risks and costs, regardless of the safety
of the transfused product.
Donor Education and Recruitment
Appropriate education and recruitment are the corner-
stones of transfusion safety in those cases where relevant
data exist. In these circumstances, centers can provide
donors with information that identifies their risk of infection
based on demographics, behavior, and/or clinical signs and
symptoms of infection. Such education can occur at the time
of recruitment, or more specifically at the time and point a
donor presents to donate. Self-deferral criteria for donors
according to risk of Zika exposure include travel to regions
with local vector-borne transmission (including areas of the
United States where state and local public health authorities
have declared the occurrence of local mosquito-borne
transmission and notice has been posted by the CDC),
sexual exposure to at-risk and infected partners, and

Zika and the Blood Supply—Katz & Rossmann
87
 information about symptoms that suggest Zika infec-
tion.10–12 These approaches have the advantage of being
capable of rapid implementation, even in the tightly
regulated current good manufacturing practices environ-
ment at blood centers. Disadvantages include poor predic-
tive value, resulting in the deferral of many donors who are
not at real risk, and the difficulty of quantifying rates of self-
deferral, and especially of classifying them as appropriate or
inappropriate.
Donor Questionnaire
The formal donor history is a second opportunity to elicit
such risks and allows quantification of the donor loss.
Amending the donor history questionnaire is a complicated
process in the highly regulated environment of the donor
room and the current good manufacturing practices
environment of blood centers. It involves drafting and
evaluation of candidate questions for accuracy and under-
standing, training of personnel, and revisions to standard
operating procedures and computer systems, with appro-
priate formal validations at each step. Consequently, this
approach takes longer than the implementation of donor
education materials. Survey research on almost 50 000
donors suggests that 28-day deferrals for travel to areas
outside the United States and Canada in the Western
Hemisphere, including areas where Zika is being actively
transmitted, should result in the loss of approximately
2.23% of winter and 1.17% of summer donors.59 This
proportion will vary and is higher in southern states,
especially their border areas, where travel to Latin America
and the Caribbean is more common.
Donor Physical Examination
For Zika, the infected donor would be most likely to be
detected, if at all, by the presence of a fever or rash. Because
donors are asked not to donate unless they feel ‘‘healthy and
well,’’ the examination is unlikely to detect many donors
who would otherwise be accepted. The donor physical
examination is generally of greater utility to protect donor
health—for example, the detection of unrecognized hyper-
tension—than for transfusion safety, where the focus is on
stigmata of injection drug use, which is not relevant to Zika.
Postdonation Information
Donors are routinely encouraged to contact their blood
center if they recall relevant information after donating or
when illness develops in the period immediately following
their donation. They are now informed specifically of the
need to contact their collector if they receive a Zika
diagnosis after donation.10–12 Receipt of this postdonation
information allows the collector to withdraw untransfused
components and to assess any need to notify the transfusion
service and/or transfusing physicians about a need to
evaluate recipients of implicated components.
TESTING FOR ZIKA
Immediately after WNV transmission by transfusion was
recognized, the critical characteristics of acute arboviral
infection kinetics were described: a short incubation period;
and appearance, then clearance of virus and viral nucleic
acid from plasma coincident with development of antibody
responses that appear rapidly and persist beyond any
reasonable estimate of infectivity. Accordingly, NAT, not
serology, was immediately recognized as the preferred
method of testing when donor screening was needed. To
support the volume of testing needed and to conserve
resources, minipool NAT, as used for HIV and hepatitis C
since 1999, was used for WNV screening. In this method,
samples from a number of donors (6–16, generally) are
combined for initial screening, and the constituent individ-
ual donations are tested only if the pool is positive. This
method is much less costly than individual tests, but some
sensitivity is lost. With the recognition that breakthrough
transmissions
can
occur
from
low-level,
seronegative
viremias missed in minipool NAT, strategies were devel-
oped
to
convert
from
minipool
to
individual
donor
screening NAT (ID-NAT) when WNV activity is demon-
strated in a geographic region. In the United States, 2
manufacturers provide all donor NAT. Roche Molecular
Systems (Pleasanton, California) uses real-time reverse
transcription-polymerase chain reaction–based assays, and
Hologic (Marlborough, Massachusetts), in partnership with
Grifols (Emeryville, California), uses transcription-mediated
amplification.
Both
have
developed
assays
for
Zika,
although both are on testing instruments and with reagents
not currently approved or in routine use in the United
States. Investigational nucleic acid tests for blood donation
screening were made available for voluntary implementa-
tion under investigational new drug exemptions (INDs),
either using ID-NAT or a combination of minipool NAT and
ID-NAT under appropriate epidemiologic circumstances, in
April 2016. Zika virus active areas (US areas with mosquito-
borne transmission) are required to suspend collection or to
use ID-NAT.
Consistent with WNV RNA donation screening assays,
the investigational NAT assays for Zika virus have 95%
lower limits of detection of less than 10 copies per
milliliter.60,61 The Intended Use statement of investigational
tests may include ‘‘other living donors,’’ a term used by the
FDA to differentiate donors of hematopoietic progenitor
cells and some other human cells, tissues, and cellular and
tissue-based product donors (referred to as HCT/Ps in FDA
guidance) from blood donors. Diagnostic (as opposed to
donor screening) assays for RNA and immunoglobulin
(IgM) are available under Emergency Use Authorization.62
Blood donation testing using ID-NAT was implemented
for collections in Puerto Rico, a Zika virus active area, under
the Roche IND in early April 2016, with weekly reactive
rates during June 2016 exceeding 1% of tested donations.63
In addition, some areas of the southern United States not
yet considered Zika active (but at higher risk for Zika virus
spread because of the presence of the mosquito vector and
persistence for long periods of suitable environmental
conditions for mosquito breeding) have voluntarily imple-
mented investigational NAT. To date, 0 of 79 000 donations
from the Houston area have been confirmed positive in
individual donation testing. With the recognition of local
mosquito-borne Zika transmission in South Florida in late
July, testing at the ID level was started there. Several
unconfirmed reactive donations, primarily from Florida, are
being investigated further at the time of this writing.64
Donations reactive on IND RNA testing are discarded and
components from prior donations within 28 days of the
positive test are recalled if untransfused. Recipients of any
such units are to be investigated for evidence of transfusion
transmission.11
Testing carried out under the IND protocol allows cost
recovery by blood centers. It is critical that blood centers and
the customer hospitals be in close communication regarding
88

Zika and the Blood Supply—Katz & Rossmann
 the risk of active Zika transmission and the risk-benefit of
voluntary
donation
screening,
because
costs
may
be
incurred. Additionally, testing only in certain areas may
lead to ‘‘mixed’’ inventories, with some units being tested
and others not. Hospital transfusion services and their
computer support may find such situations problematic.
Transfusion services may choose to use tested units only in
high-risk situations, such as transfusions to pregnant
women or intrauterine transfusions, but such situations
are not well defined.
Pathogen Reduction
A pathogen reduction technology licensed in the United
States for transfusible plasma and apheresis platelets
(INTERCEPT Blood System, Cerus Corporation, Concord,
California) is effective in inactivating Zika virus as assessed
by in vitro infectivity assays (.6.5 log10 in plasma). Similar
findings in apheresis platelets have been presented (.4.2 to
6.8 log10 reduction of infectious virus) that are dependent on
the platelet collection method.65 In corresponding RNA
detection assays, greater than 10 log10 reduction of Zika
virus RNA is observed in plasma; this would represent a
margin of safety of 3 to 5 log10 with INTERCEPT treatment
compared with reported viral copy numbers for RNA-
positive donors in French Polynesia (mean, 4.85 log10, with
6.91 log10 as the highest reported value).66 These reductions
are consistent with those reported for other arboviruses
using the same technology. The FDA guidance permits the
use of licensed or investigational pathogen reduction in lieu
of cessation of collections or of investigational blood
donation screening in Zika virus active areas. Lesser
reductions have been presented for an alternative pathogen
reduction process.67
Guidance Documents
The February 2016 FDA Guidance requires the follow-
ing12:
1. Potential donors with travel to areas with local Zika
transmission (including in the United States) are asked
to self-defer for 4 weeks after the end of their potential
exposure. Presenting donors are provided with a list of
such areas and formally deferred for 28 days, well
beyond the maximum duration of plasma viremia.
2. Donors with a Zika infection diagnosis are deferred for 4
weeks following complete resolution of their illness.
3. Sexual partners of males who received a Zika diagnosis,
or were at risk for Zika infection, during the 3 months
before an attempted donation are deferred for 4 weeks
after the last such sexual contact.
4. Otherwise acceptable donors are informed to call their
blood collection facility if they subsequently realize they
should have self-deferred or been deferred based on
such exposures, regardless of the presence or absence of
symptoms, or if they have a diagnosis of Zika.
In late August 2016, the FDA revised this guidance15 and
required testing of all donations collected in the United
States and its territories with an investigational ID-NAT for
Zika virus under an IND application or, when available, a
licensed test. The option to use pathogen reduction was
included as an alternative for those products (platelets,
plasma) for which a licensed system is available. Blood
collectors in states and territories with locally acquired Zika
cases (at the time of guidance publication, these were
Florida and Puerto Rico) were to implement such testing
immediately. Eleven other states—because of their proxim-
ity to areas with locally acquired cases or because of an
epidemiologic link, such as a high number of travel cases—
were to implement this recommendation no later than 4
weeks after issue, that is, late September 2016. These states
are Alabama, Arizona, California, Georgia, Hawaii, Louisi-
ana, Mississippi, New Mexico, New York, South Carolina,
and Texas. All other states are to implement the recom-
mendations ‘‘as soon as feasible,’’ but within 12 weeks of
the guidance issue date. Blood collectors who implemented
such testing no longer had to apply the travel deferrals
previously required.
This guidance requires substantially more testing than has
been previously performed for any pathogen in an
individual-donation format rather than a pooled format.
This requires additional resources. Implementation within
the specified timeline will pose operational challenges.
Scope of Risk Reduction Needed
It is possible to select Zika risk-reduced blood products
only for certain recipients, or, alternatively, to use testing
only for certain donors, such as those who have recently
traveled to a risk area. Both approaches were in use by
various collectors and hospitals prior to the latest FDA
guidance. This is similar to the selective use of donor
cytomegalovirus testing or application of gamma irradiation
to components destined for patients recognized to be at risk
for transfusion-associated graft-versus-host disease. The
only recipient group that has been definitively identified as
needing risk-reduced products is pregnant women, but this
spectrum of risk is not fixed.
TRANSPLANTATION AND TISSUES
The apparent persistence of Zika virus in tissues other
than blood has led the FDA to issue guidance for HCT/Ps
that is different from those for blood.14 These rules cover
many
types
of
tissues,
including
skin,
ocular
tissue,
reproductive cells and tissues, and cells derived from
peripheral or cord blood. The guidance, issued March 1,
2016, for immediate implementation, identified Zika as a
relevant communicable disease agent or disease. It defined
as ineligible any living donor who had, within the past 6
months, a medical diagnosis of Zika virus infection, or
residence in or travel to an area with active Zika virus
transmission within the past 6 months, as well as sex within
the past 6 months with a male who is known to have either
of the preceding risk factors. Additionally, the donor of any
gestational tissues (including umbilical cord blood) is
ineligible if she has received a medical diagnosis of Zika
virus at any point during that pregnancy; if she has resided
in or traveled to an area with active Zika virus transmission
at any point during that pregnancy; or if she has had sex at
any point during that pregnancy with a male who has either
had a medical diagnosis of Zika virus or has residence in or
travel to an area with active Zika virus transmission.
Cadaveric (non–heart-beating) donors are ineligible only if
they have had a medical diagnosis of Zika virus in the past 6
months. It is important to note that the ‘‘ineligible’’ donor
may be used in a number of circumstances when no
comparable tissue or transplant from an eligible donor is
available and the recipient is likely to suffer death or serious
morbidity without the tissue, that is, when there is ‘‘urgent
medical need.’’ The scarcity of organs for transplantation
Arch Pathol Lab Med—Vol 141, January 2017
Zika and the Blood Supply—Katz & Rossmann
89
 and the necessity of very close HLA matching for some
types of transplant means that products from ‘‘ineligible’’
donors are used more frequently than a similar blood
product would be. Special labeling is required for these
products.
The
National
Marrow
Donor
Program
has
instituted a special questionnaire to determine whether
donors of hematopoietic progenitor cells are eligible;
considering the importance of HLA matching for allogeneic
transplants, ineligible donors may be used if the transplant
center
determines
it
is
appropriate
(ie,
that
benefit
outweighs risk). Similar changes have been made to
screening procedures for solid organ transplants.68
If Zika establishes local transmission over any substantial
geographic
area,
problems
arise
for
not
only
organ
transplants from the area, but cord blood and other types
of tissue banking activities. In light of unknown risk and
absent adequate testing strategies, cord blood banks may
have to suspend activities for a period. This is an area of
active discussion with the FDA.69 In general, similar
approaches to organ and tissue safety have been taken by
the European Union, although more NAT testing of affected
tissues and donors is proposed.70
APPROACHES TO RISK
Precautionary Principle
In evaluating a new threat to blood and tissue safety, the
United States does not formally use a risk analysis or
decision-making framework, but acts with a more precau-
tionary approach. The precautionary principle is a theoret-
ical one, most commonly discussed as applied to
environmental issues, that states that if the harm to the
public is unknown or something is not known to be safe or
there is not scientific consensus, it shall be regulated as
though it were dangerous. Thus, for example, we do not
wait for demonstration of harm from transmission by
transfusion of the Zika virus, but take steps in advance to
avoid this, assuming such transfusion would be dangerous.
This approach is undoubtedly related to the very painful
history of the transfusion transmission of HIV in many
countries in the 1980s, and is in contrast to a more formal,
risk-based process that has been used elsewhere.
Risk-Based Decision Making
In the United States, transparent, formal risk analysis is
not necessarily undertaken before FDA guidance regarding
blood safety is considered.71 The FDA’s Zika guidances have
been issued as final, with no formal risk assessment
included and without public consultation with the blood
community or other stakeholders. Interventions involving
considerable donor losses due to travel deferrals and/or
considerable expense for testing are being implemented
rapidly, based in large part on the agency’s insistence that
the steps it has dictated are justified by the risk being
mitigated. The blood community has developed, and
advocates the public application of, a risk-based decision-
making framework to rationalize these processes, making
specific reference to using a broad societal perspective to
consider interventions affecting a wide variety of stakehold-
ers both from within and outside the transfusion medicine
‘‘silo.’’72 This framework is sensitive to multiple contexts: the
nature of the risks being considered, evolving technology,
ethical issues, and competition for economic resources.
Monte Carlo simulations performed by investigators at
H´
ema-Qu´
ebec and Canadian Blood Services suggest that
the risk of travel-acquired (as opposed to local) donor
viremia will be less than 1 in 200 000 000 with a 21-day
deferral after Canadian travel to a destination with rates of
Zika infection consistent with those being reported in Brazil.
Applying US-specific model parameters yields a risk of 1 in
563 000 with no travel deferral and 1 in 66 700 000 with a
21-day deferral.73 If one assumes it likely that serious clinical
morbidity will be confined to pregnant women being
transfused early in pregnancy, the clinical risk is less than
these estimates. Another model, for Australia, estimates the
risk of collecting a viremic donation from a female donor
infected by sexual transmission from a male partner (V.
Hoad and A. Keller, written communication, February
2016). Their point estimate is 1 in 9 370 000, with a risk of
symptomatic infection in the transfusion recipient of 1 in
46 800 000 and a risk of severe developmental abnormality
of 1 in 1 874 000 000 in a baby born to a mother infected by
transfusion during pregnancy. Such models must be refined
in the future as the epidemic evolves and more precise
estimates of appropriate inputs become available.
Although the risk-based decision-making framework was
developed specifically for blood-collecting organizations to
systematize the processes of issue identification, risk
assessment, stakeholder engagement, risk communication,
and decision-making, it should be adaptable to the public
policy realm. Its objectives are straightforward: (1) optimal
blood safety, recognizing that elimination of all risk is not
possible from the standpoints of both blood supply
adequacy and costs; (2) appropriate resource allocation in
proportion to the magnitude and seriousness of the risk and
the effectiveness of the interventions to reduce risk; and (3)
explicit assessment and incorporation of the social, eco-
nomic, and ethical factors that should affect decisions about
risk.
CONCLUSIONS
The situation of Zika in the United States and world is
changing daily, as are our knowledge and evaluation of
transfusion and transplant risk. An active dialogue between
all affected parties and regulators is necessary to assure the
optimal outcome of a safe and adequate supply for blood,
tissue, and transplant recipients.
