BACKGROUND Epistaxis is the most frequent and disabling manifestation of hereditary
hemorrhagic telangiectasia (HHT). The efficacy of intravenous bevacizumab (an anti–vascular
endothelial growth factor monoclonal antibody) for epistaxis has been shown. However, the
efficacy of intranasal bevacizumab has yet to be evaluated.
OBJECTIVE To evaluate the efficacy of 3 different doses of bevacizumab administered as a
nasal spray in a repeated manner for the duration of nosebleeds in patients with HHT.
DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS Randomized, multicenter, placebo-controlled, phase
2/3 clinical trial with dose selection at an intermediate analysis and prespecified stopping
rules (nonbinding stopping for futility). Patients aged 18 years or older with a diagnosis of
HHT were recruited from 5 French centers from April 2014 to January 2015 with a 6-month
follow-up after the end of treatment. Participants had a history of self-reported nosebleeds
with a monthly duration of more than 20 minutes in at least the 3 months prior to inclusion
corroborated by epistaxis grids completed during the same preinclusion period.
INTERVENTIONS Eighty consecutive HHT patients were randomized and treated in the phase
2 study, with 4 parallel groups in a 1:1:1:1 ratio. One group received placebo (n = 21); the other
3 received bevacizumab nasal spray. Each bevacizumab group received a different dose of the
drug (25 mg [n = 20], 50 mg [n = 20], or 75 mg [n = 19] per treatment) in 3 doses 14 days
apart for a total treatment duration of 4 weeks, resulting in a total dose of 75 mg, 150 mg, and
225 mg in each treatment group.
MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES Mean monthly epistaxis duration for 3 consecutive months
immediately after the end of the treatment.
RESULTS Of the 80 patients who were randomized (mean age, 60.47 [SD, 10.61] years;
37 women [46.25%]), 75 completed the study. Mean monthly epistaxis duration measured
at 3 months was not significantly different in the 59 patients receiving bevacizumab in
comparison with the placebo group (P = .57) or between the bevacizumab groups. The mean
monthly epistaxis duration was 259.2 minutes (95% CI, 82.1-436.3 minutes) in the 25-mg
group, 244.0 minutes (95% CI, 81.8-406.2 minutes) in the 50-mg group, 215.0 minutes (95%
CI, 102.8-327.2 minutes) in the 75-mg group, and 200.4 minutes (95% CI, 109.3-291.5
minutes) in the placebo group. Toxicity was low and no severe adverse events were reported.
This study was terminated prior to phase 3 for treatment futility after interim analysis on the
recommendations of an independent data monitoring committee.
CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE In patients with HHT, a bevacizumab nasal spray treatment of
3 administrations at 14-day intervals with doses of 25 mg, 50 mg, or 75 mg per spray,
compared with a placebo, did not reduce monthly epistaxis duration in the 3 consecutive
months immediately after the end of treatment.

H
ereditary hemorrhagic telangiectasia (HHT) is a domi-
nantly inherited genetic vascular disorder character-
ized by recurrent epistaxis, cutaneous telangiec-
tasia, and visceral arteriovenous malformations. Diagnosis is
based on clinical criteria.1
The most obvious expression of the disorder is the occur-
rence of spontaneous, repeated epistaxis.2 These epistaxis epi-
sodes can be severe and life threatening; they are often the
cause of chronic anemia and can require treatment with iron
supplementation and blood transfusions. There is currently no
medical or surgical treatment available to cure the nosebleeds
definitively. Repeated surgical treatments often lead to com-
plications, such as nasal septum perforation, resulting in wors-
ening of the nosebleeds.
Hereditary hemorrhagic telangiectasia is related to an
imbalanced state between antiangiogenic factors and proan-
giogenic factors, such as vascular endothelial growth factor
(VEGF),3 secondary to mutations in 3 genes, ENG (encoding
endoglin),4 ACRLV1 (encoding activin receptor-like kinase 1),5
and MADH4 (encoding SMAD4). Because of the molecular
mechanisms involved, a small phase 2 clinical trial was
conducted using intravenous bevacizumab (an anti-VEGF
monoclonal antibody) in patients with severe hepatic forms
of HHT. Significant improvements in liver consequences as
well as epistaxis were reported.6 To limit the systemic
adverse effects of bevacizumab and to make the treatment
easier, local administration seemed suitable. Bevacizumab
transport through porcine nasal mucosa was evaluated and
evidence of absorption was observed.7 Furthermore, several
published cases reported the potential efficacy of a bevaci-
zumab nasal spray.8-12
A phase 1 study13 concluded that bevacizumab adminis-
teredbynasalsprayinHHTwassaferegardlessofdose.Aphase
2 study was thus needed to assess the efficacy of a bevaci-
zumab nasal spray on epistaxis in HHT. The present study re-
ports the design of a combined phase 2/3 study to test the ef-
ficacyofabevacizumabnasalsprayandtheresultsofthephase
2 study on the duration of nosebleeds vs placebo adminis-
tered in a repeated manner in patients with HHT complicated
by nosebleeds.
Methods
Study Overview
The study was a randomized, multicenter, placebo-
controlled clinical trial. This study was approved by the local
research ethics committee and by the French Medical Prod-
ucts Agency in February 2014. Written informed consent was
obtained from all patients in accordance with national regu-
lations. The trial was conducted in accordance with the prin-
ciples of the Declaration of Helsinki14 and Good Clinical Prac-
tice guidelines.
Patients
This study enrolled patients aged 18 years or older with clini-
cally confirmed HHT and a history of epistaxis (mean >20 min-
utes per month over a 3-month period prior to inclusion, as-
sessed using nosebleed reporting grids filled in by the patients)
who had not undergone nasal surgery in the 3 months prior
to inclusion.
Exlusion criteria included women who were pregnant or
those likely to become so during the study, patients with an
ongoing infectious condition, patients who had participated
in another clinical trial in the 28 days prior to inclusion, pa-
tients with known hypersensitivity to the active ingredients
or one of the carrier agents, or patients who had incompletely
filled in the nosebleed grids in the 3 months preceding inclu-
sion. Potentially eligible patients were identified by physi-
cians working in the French HHT network and informed of the
study during a consultation in an HHT center.
Study Design
This was an adaptive combined phase 2/3 study with dose se-
lection during the interim analysis.15,16 The first step con-
sisted of a randomized study with 4 parallel groups in a 1:1:1:1
ratio (phase 2 study): 1 placebo group and 3 groups receiving
different doses of bevacizumab (25, 50, or 75 mg per treat-
ment) administered as a nasal spray (3 sprays 14 days apart for
a total treatment duration of 4 weeks), resulting in total doses
of 75 mg, 150 mg, and 225 mg in the bevacizumab treatment
groups. An interim analysis was planned at the end of step 1,
after inclusion and 3 months of follow-up of the 80 patients.
Then, the most efficient dose would be selected and the sec-
ond stage of the trial would begin, with the patients random-
ized into 2 groups, 1 receiving the bevacizumab dose retained
and 1 receiving placebo, using an allocation ratio of 2:1 (phase
3 study). An independent data monitoring committee com-
posed of a statistician, an ear, nose, and throat specialist, an
HHT specialist, and a clinical pharmacologist evaluated data
at the interim analysis. Nonbinding rules for termination of the
study for futility on the recommendations of the indepen-
dent data monitoring committee were designed to guarantee
the greatest flexibility for the second stage.16 There were no
prespecified thresholds for differences.
Data were collected at each treatment visit (days 0, 14, and
28) and during the 6-month follow-up (2 visits at 3 and 6
months after the end of treatment), including a physical ex-
amination, ear, nose, and throat examination, a question-
naire on nasal obstruction, measurement of hemoglobin and
Key Points
Question Are bevacizumab nasal sprays an efficient treatment for
nosebleeds in patients with hereditary hemorrhagic telangiectasia
(HHT) when 3 doses of 25 mg, 50 mg, or 75 mg are administered
at 14-day intervals?
Findings In this randomized, combined phase 2/3 clinical trial
among 80 patients, no significant difference was observed in
mean monthly epistaxis duration after the end of treatment. This
study was terminated early for treatment futility after the
intermediate analysis.
Meaning In patients with HHT, a bevacizumab nasal spray
treatment did not reduce monthly epistaxis duration 3 months
after the end of treatment in comparison with a placebo.

ferritin levels, and assessment for adverse events, plus a tele-
phone questionnaire 1 and 2 months after the end of treat-
ment. All data were collected centrally at the clinical trials unit
of the Hospices Civils de Lyon, France.
A pharmaceutical department (Lyon center) randomized
allocation of the study drug doses or placebo. The random-
izationlistwasestablishedusingSASsoftware,version9.2(SAS
Institute Inc), and was balanced per center with a block of 4
patients with 1 placebo patient for 3 study drug patients using
a 1:1:1:1 allocation ratio.
Patients received a 1-day treatment of bevacizumab or pla-
cebo intranasally 3 times, at 14-day intervals, for a total treat-
ment duration of 4 weeks. Undiluted bevacizumab (25 mg/mL
ofbevacizumab,trehalosedihydrate,sodiumphosphate,poly-
sorbate 20, and water for injections [Roche]) was packaged by
a pharmaceutical department in a calibrated nasal spray bottle
that delivered 0.1 mL per nebulization. The solution was used
as is and prepared on the day of administration to the pa-
tientsbythehospitalpharmacy(unblended)atthehospitalcen-
ter in which the patients were managed. Regardless of ran-
domization group, to maintain blinding it was necessary to
prepare3differentyetphysicallyidenticalspraybottlesforeach
patient. The 3 spray bottles were prepared with either beva-
cizumab or placebo in relation to the randomization group and
numbered so as to determine their order of administration.
Each patient received 3 nasal nebulizations, administered ev-
ery 30 minutes into each nostril over a 2-hour period in the
course of a consultation with blood pressure measurement be-
fore and after treatment. The placebo used was 0.9% sodium
chloride.
Study End Points
The primary outcome was mean monthly epistaxis duration
assessed by monitoring epistaxis grids (Supplement 1) com-
pleted by patients for 3 months after the end of the treatment
(fromday29today118).Thesegridswerecomparedwithmean
monthly epistaxis duration in the 3 consecutive months be-
fore the beginning of the treatment (from day −90 to day −1).
The efficacy criterion was not measured immediately at the
end of treatment because the previous study highlighted that
efficacy was delayed compared with the beginning of
treatment.6
Secondaryoutcomesweremeanmonthlyfrequency(num-
ber per month) of nosebleeds, quality of life (evaluated with
the 36-item Short Form Health Survey [SF-36] quality-of-life
questionnaire), number of red blood cell transfusions, and bio-
logical efficacy criteria (hemoglobin and serum ferritin lev-
els). Epistaxis grids and blood transfusions were recorded for
the 3 months before treatment (from day −90 to day −1) and
duringtheentirestudyandhemoglobinandferritinlevelswere
measured at days 0, 14, 28, 58, 118, and 208. The SF-36 quality-
of-life questionnaire was administered at day 0, day 118
(3 months after the end of treatment), and day 208 (6 months
after the end of treatment).
Safety
Safety was evaluated at each visit by physical examination
(monitoring of blood pressure; clinical ear, nose, and throat ex-
amination to check the nasal septum, the absence of nasal per-
forationaftertreatment,andotheradverseeffectsonnasalmu-
cosa), laboratory testing, and assessment for adverse events.
Adverse events were classified and recorded using the web-
based MedDRA. Furthermore, based on known bevacizumab
adverse events, any events were classified by the investiga-
tors as unrelated, doubtfully or possibly, or probably or cer-
tainly related to the treatment. The independent data moni-
toring committee met in case of the occurrence of serious
adverse events.
Statistical Analysis
The sample size was first computed so that each test of the
elementary null hypothesis Hi would have a power close
to 1 − β = .9 to show a relative decrease of 40% in the mean epi-
staxis duration compared with placebo, which was judged to
be a significant improvement for patients. Given the as-
sumed log-normal distribution of the outcome and data in the
literature,6,17thiswouldcorrespondtoshowinganabsolutedif-
ference in the means of the logarithms of the mean epistaxis
duration of δ = −0.52 compared with placebo. It was as-
sumed that the standard deviation of the logarithm of mean
epistaxis duration was σ = 0.63 in each group. An overall num-
ber of patients of 40 per group ensured a power of 89%. With
a 1:2 allocation ratio at the second stage, selecting n1 = n2 = 20
without interim analysis provides an overall power of 94.4%,
more than 90%. However, it was decided to keep this num-
ber of patients to account for the power loss induced by the
useoftheFishercombinationtestandtomaintainbetterpower
in case bevacizumab was slightly less effective than expected
or if the standard deviation of the outcome was slightly higher
than planned.
It was decided to perform the interim analysis when 20 pa-
tients per group had been randomized. The interim analysis
with dose selection and reassessment of the sample size for
the second stage was prespecified and carried out by an inde-
pendent statistician who was blinded to the study groups
(except the placebo group).
Quantitative parameters at inclusion were presented as
means and standard deviations and medians and ranges for
all groups and were compared using the t test (or Mann-
Whitney test in the case of nonnormality). Qualitative para-
meters at inclusion were presented as numbers and percent-
ages and compared using the χ2 test (or Fisher exact test
when conditions for the χ2 test were not fulfilled). The effi-
cacy and safety population was defined as all treated
patients. Patients were analyzed in the treatment group to
which they were randomized (intention-to-treat analysis).
Concerning the main outcome, the logarithms of the mean
duration of nosebleeds were analyzed with a t test with
Simes correction for multiplicity.
Differences between monthly mean number and dura-
tionofepistaxisepisodesbeforeandaftertreatmentwerecom-
pared between the placebo and bevacizumab groups with an
analysis-of-variance test (or Kruskal-Wallis test in the case of
nonnormality). Trends over time for hemoglobin and ferritin
levels and all dimensions of the SF-36 questionnaire were as-
sessed using a mixed model for repeated measures (time,

Results
Trial Population
EightypatientswererandomizedbetweenApril2014andJanu-
ary 2015 and analyzed at interim analysis in 4 groups (25-mg
doses [n = 20], 50-mg doses [n = 20], and 75-mg doses [n = 19]
of bevacizumab and placebo [n = 21]) in 5 different centers
(Lyon, Paris Hôpital Ambroise Paré, Montpellier, Poitiers, and
Marseille). The baseline characteristics are summarized in
Table 1 and were similar in the 4 groups. The mean age was
60.47 (SD, 10.61) years; 37 participants (46.25%) were women.
All individuals assessed for eligibility met the inclusion crite-
ria and were enrolled in the study. The study involvement of
5 patients was terminated early because of a missing epi-
staxis grid at 6 months (n = 1), surgical nasal treatment (n = 1),
or loss to follow-up (n = 3) (Figure 1). All patients except 1 in
the bevacizumab 25-mg group completed 4 weeks of treat-
ment and received the 3 doses of treatment. No dose-limiting
toxic effects were observed.
Response to Treatment
Primary Outcome at Intermediate Analysis
Data on all patients were analyzed (n = 80). The results of the
intermediate analysis are summarized in Table 2 and
Figure 2. No statistical difference was observed in the pla-
cebo group compared with the other groups, regardless of
dose group (P = .57). The mean duration of epistaxis after
treatment was 200.4 minutes (95% CI, 109.3-291.5 minutes)

(95% CI, −0.65 to 1.17) in the 25-mg bevacizumab group, 0.26
(95% CI, −0.63 to 1.15) in the 50-mg bevacizumab group, and
0.20 (95% CI, −0.70 to 1.10) in the 75-mg bevacizumab group.
The primary outcome showed higher variability than origi-
nally considered in the protocol, with a standard deviation
twice that used when planning the trial. On the basis of these
results and after meeting with the independent data monitor-
ing committee, the investigators decided to stop the study.
Secondary Outcomes
At 3 and 6 months after the end of the treatment, no signifi-
cant differences were observed between the bevacizumab and
placebo groups in terms of the number of epistaxis episodes
(P = .55) (Figure 3A). The mean numbers of epistaxis epi-
sodes before treatment (from day −90 to day −1) and 3 months
after treatment (from day 29 to day 118), respectively, were
30.99 vs 23.13 in the 25-mg bevacizumab group, 25.06 vs 20.01
in the 50-mg bevacizumab group, 27.84 vs 24.35 in the 75-mg
bevacizumab group, and 31.37 vs 24.27 in the placebo group
(P = .24).
The number of red blood cell transfusions did not differ
significantly from inclusion to 3 and 6 months after the end
of the treatment (P = .35 and P = .39, respectively). Mean num-
bers of red blood cell transfusions were 0.15 and 0.25 in the
25-mg bevacizumab group, 1.45 and 2.40 in the 50-mg group,
1.16 and 1.79 in the 75-mg group, and 0.76 and 1.05 in the pla-
cebo group from inclusion to 3 and 6 months after the end of
the treatment, respectively.
Biological criteria (hemoglobin level [Figure 3B] and fer-
ritin level) were not significantly improved 3 and 6 months af-
ter the end of the treatment. Mean hemoglobin level did not
significantlyimproveovertime(P = .66)andevolutionwasnot
different between groups (P = .68). Values at inclusion, month
3, and month 6, respectively, were 12.46 g/dL, 12.32 g/dL, and
12.55 g/dL in the bevacizumab 25-mg group; 12.08 g/dL,
11.79 g/dL, and 11.83 g/dL in the 50-mg group; 11.55 g/dL,
11.46 g/dL, and 11.28 g/dL in the 75-mL group; and 12.25 g/dL,
12.34 g/dL, and 12.42 g/dL in the placebo group.
Mean ferritin levels at inclusion, month 3, and month 6,
respectively, were 70.47 μg/L, 50.55 μg/L, and 64.63 μg/L in
the 25-mg group; 42.55 μg/L, 40.10 μg/L, and 44.47 μg/L in
the 50-mg group; 52.21 μg/L, 59.53 μg/L, and 33.53 μg/L in the
75-mg group; and 86.00 μg/L, 78.62 μg/L, and 53.42 μg/L in
the placebo group. There was no significant trend over time
(P = .86) and no difference of evolution between groups was
observed (P = .70).
The SF-36 questionnaire (Figure 3, C and D) revealed no
differences in the dimensions of quality of life after treat-
ment (bodily pain, P = .71; general health, P = .97; mental
health, P = .59; physical functioning, P = .68; social function-
ing, P = .66; and vitality, P = .67); it did find differences in 2
dimensions (emotional role, P = .008; and physical role,
P = .006). There were no differences in evolution between the
groups.
Safety Outcomes
No adverse events certainly or probably related to the treat-
ment were recorded. A total of 161 adverse events were
recorded without differences between the groups (47 in the
25-mg bevacizumab group, 33 in the 50-mg bevacizumab
group, 38 in the 75-mg bevacizumab group, and 43 in the pla-
cebo group). Of these, 26 unrelated serious adverse events
(classified into 37 different system organ classes) were
observed (9 in the 25-mg group, 5 in the 50-mg group, 6 in
the 75-mg group, and 6 in the placebo group). No blood pres-
sure variation was recorded before or after treatment.
Discussion
This phase 2, double-blind, multicenter, randomized,
placebo-controlled trial examined the efficacy of intranasal

including number of epistaxis episodes, quality of life, num-
ber of red blood cell transfusions, or hemoglobin and ferri-
tin levels. We previously published the results of a phase 1
study that did not show any efficacy. In that case, however,
the spray was administered only once to assess tolerance.13
Riss and colleagues18 published encouraging results for
nasal bevacizumab in 9 patients, although the drug (100 mg
of bevacizumab) was injected into the nasal mucosa under
endoscopic control. To avoid the risk of nasal septum perfo-
ration, we preferred to use a nasal spray. Many of the case
reports published support the possible efficacy of a bevaci-
zumab nasal spray.9-11,19-21 However, because of high varia-
tion in the number and duration of epistaxis episodes in
patients with HHT, prospective randomized clinical trials
are needed to definitively determine efficacy of any pro-
posed intervention.
The absence of observed efficacy for intranasal bevaci-
zumab might be related to several factors. First, bevacizumab
is a recombinant, humanized, IgG1 monoclonal antibody
with a high molecular weight (149 kDa), a characteristic that
may limit transport through biological membranes. We previ-
ously performed an ex vivo study to assess its transport
through the nasal mucosa.7 The bevacizumab concentrations
found in the mucosa were highly variable, ranging from 6%
to 42% depending on the sample and its localization (cavity
or septum). We can thus hypothesize that bevacizumab
absorption varies considerably for each patient and within a
single patient. Frequent nosebleeds and nasal crust are also a
physical barrier to drug absorption. This was reinforced by
the pharmacokinetics analysis performed in the phase 1
study, showing that the drug was not detected in any blood
samples.13 Second, the doses and administration of bevaci-
zumab may have been inadequate. However, dosing was
based on previous case reports suggesting efficacy: 1 mg into
each nostril twice each day for 2 consecutive weeks9 or with
higher doses 1 time in a repeated manner (25 mg into each
nostril,9 100 mg every 8 to 9 weeks,19 and 50 mg initiated at
the request of the patient after a new increase in the Epistaxis
Severity Score).20
Tolerance of intranasal bevacizumab was excellent after
a 1-day nasal spray administration 3 times, regardless of the
dose. As in other cases published using intranasal bevaci-
zumab alone, no treatment-related adverse events were
observed.9,20,22Patientswerecarefullymonitoredfornasalcar-
tilaginous septum perforations, which have been described as
an adverse effect of intravenous bevacizumab in cancer
patients,23-26aswellassubmucosalbevacizumabinjections11,21
or laser treatments,27 but never topical treatments. In this
study, nasal cartilaginous septum perforation was not ob-
served following treatment administration. No pharmacoki-
netics study was performed for this study, but no systemic ef-
fect was in evidence. No variations in blood pressure were
observed.
This trial had several limitations. First, patients com-
pleted epistaxis grids and noted epistaxis duration, which are
not directly observed outcomes and are subject to error. In
other countries, the Epistaxis Severity Score is used, taking
into account epistaxis frequency and duration and blood
transfusions. The present study used the same tool (the epi-
staxis grid) as in previous published studies on epistaxis in
HHT.6,13,17 Second, we included all HHT patients with nose-
bleeds and did not take into account a history of nasal sur-
gery or nasal crusts, which may change mucosal drug absorp-
tion. Almost all patients had undergone different types of
surgery. Third, early termination of the study after the first
stage is a limitation. The principle of nonbinding termination
for futility was envisaged in the protocol. We acknowledge
that the decision to stop the trial was crucial. It followed the
recommendations of the independent data monitoring com-
mittee. In this study, the observed effect was consistent in
the 3 groups, but in the opposite direction to that expected
(a worse outcome for the 3 bevacizumab groups compared
with placebo). It is possible that a real effect was missed, as
the study was powered based on the assumption of a large
effect size (40%). Moreover, the primary outcome showed
higher variability than originally considered in the protocol,
with a standard deviation twice that used when planning the
trial. Independent statistical analysis provided the indepen-
dent data monitoring committee with conditional power cal-
culations, which showed that, accounting for this higher vari-
ability, the trial had a low probability of concluding if it
continued to the second stage, even when increasing the
sample size within the limits fixed by the protocol.
Conclusions
In patients with HHT, a bevacizumab nasal spray treatment of
3 administrations at 14-day intervals with doses of 25 mg,
50 mg, or 75 mg per spray, compared with a placebo, did not
reducemonthlyepistaxisdurationinthe3consecutivemonths
immediately after the end of treatment.
