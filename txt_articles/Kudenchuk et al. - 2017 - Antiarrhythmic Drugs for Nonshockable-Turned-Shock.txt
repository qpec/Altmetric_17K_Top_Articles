BACKGROUND: Out-of-hospital cardiac arrest (OHCA) commonly presents with 
nonshockable rhythms (asystole and pulseless electric activity). It is unknown whether 
antiarrhythmic drugs are safe and effective when nonshockable rhythms evolve to 
shockable rhythms (ventricular fibrillation/pulseless ventricular tachycardia [VF/VT]) 
during resuscitation.
METHODS: Adults with nontraumatic OHCA, vascular access, and VF/VT anytime 
after ≥1 shock(s) were prospectively randomized, double-blind, to receive 
amiodarone, lidocaine, or placebo by paramedics. Patients presenting with initial 
shock-refractory VF/VT were previously reported. The current study was a prespecified 
analysis in a separate cohort that initially presented with nonshockable OHCA and 
was randomized on subsequently developing shock-refractory VF/VT. The primary 
outcome was survival to hospital discharge. Secondary outcomes included discharge 
functional status and adverse drug-related effects.
RESULTS: Of 37 
889 patients with OHCA, 3026 with initial VF/VT and 1063 with 
initial nonshockable-turned-shockable rhythms were treatment-eligible, were 
randomized, and received their assigned drug. Baseline characteristics among patients 
with nonshockable-turned-shockable rhythms were balanced across treatment arms, 
except that recipients of a placebo included fewer men and were less likely to receive 
bystander cardiopulmonary resuscitation. Active-drug recipients in this cohort required 
fewer shocks, supplemental doses of their assigned drug, and ancillary antiarrhythmic 
drugs than recipients of a placebo (P<0.05). In all, 16 (4.1%) amiodarone, 11 (3.1%) 
lidocaine, and 6 (1.9%) placebo-treated patients survived to hospital discharge (P=0.24). 
No significant interaction between treatment assignment and discharge survival occurred 
with the initiating OHCA rhythm (asystole, pulseless electric activity, or VF/VT). Survival 
in each of these categories was consistently higher with active drugs, although the 
trends were not statistically significant. Adjusted absolute differences (95% confidence 
interval) in survival from nonshockable-turned-shockable arrhythmias with amiodarone 
versus placebo were 2.3% (‒0.3, 4.8), P=0.08, and for lidocaine versus placebo 1.2% 
(‒1.1, 3.6), P=0.30. More than 50% of these survivors were functionally independent 
or required minimal assistance. Drug-related adverse effects were infrequent.
CONCLUSIONS: Outcome from nonshockable-turned-shockable OHCA is poor but 
not invariably fatal. Although not statistically significant, point estimates for survival 
were greater after amiodarone or lidocaine than placebo, without increased risk of 
adverse effects or disability and consistent with previously observed favorable trends 
from treatment of initial shock-refractory VF/VT with these drugs. Together the 
findings may signal a clinical benefit that invites further investigation.

S
udden out-of-hospital cardiac arrest (OHCA) 
claims the lives of 347 000 persons each year 
in North America and hundreds of thousands 
more worldwide.1,2 The epidemiology of OHCA has 
changed over recent years, such that nonshockable 
rhythms (bradyasystole and pulseless electric activity 
[PEA]) now predominate and are deemed to be largely 
nonsurvivable.3–5
Nonshockable rhythms may evolve to shockable ven-
tricular fibrillation or pulseless ventricular tachycardia 
(VF/VT) during the course of resuscitation in ≤25% of 
patients with OHCA, for whom antiarrhythmic drug use 
has both pragmatic and public health importance.6,7 
Although antiarrhythmic medications are commonly 
administered for VF/VT, their specific role in treating 
nonshockable-turned-shockable rhythms has not been 
rigorously evaluated. Even if effective, their delayed de-
ployment could prove too late to alter the clinical out-
come from VF/VT that arises from a protracted period 
of asystole or PEA. Furthermore, the effects of antiar-
rhythmic drugs on conduction and tissue refractoriness 
could prove counterproductive were this to promote 
the recrudescence of bradyarrhythmias or PEA that 
originally provoked or accompanied OHCA or result in 
other harmful effects. Conversely, effective pharmaco-
logical suppression of recalcitrant VF/VT could help re-
store and stabilize circulation and in turn improve out-
come. In short, the optimal approach to such patients 
is unknown.
The ALPS (Amiodarone, Lidocaine, or Placebo 
Study) was a prospective, randomized, double-blind, 
placebo-controlled multicenter trial evaluating the ef-
fectiveness of amiodarone and lidocaine for OHCA 
because of shock-resistant VF/VT.8 Although the trial’s 
main focus was on patients whose initial presenting 
OHCA rhythm was VF/VT, in actuality those patients 
with shock-resistant VF/VT at any time during resusci-
tation were eligible for randomization.9 Thus, by de-
sign, the trial randomized 2 cohorts: those with initial 
VF/VT (previously reported) and the complementary 
group with initially nonshockable OHCA arrhythmias 
(asystole or PEA) that subsequently turned shockable 
during the course of resuscitation. Accordingly, we un-
dertook a prespecified investigation of the clinical ef-
fects of amiodarone or lidocaine compared to placebo 
in the randomized cohort with initial nonshockable-
turned-shockable OHCA. The primary outcome was 
survival to hospital discharge; secondary outcomes 
included functional status at discharge and adverse 
drug-related effects.
METHODS
Patients
The background, methods, and primary outcome of the ALPS 
trial were previously described.8,9 This trial was conducted in 
compliance with all applicable regulatory requirements for 
exception from informed consent in emergency research. It 
involved paramedics from 55 emergency medical services 
(EMS) agencies across 10 North American sites participating in 
the Resuscitation Outcomes Consortium.10 The trial enrolled 
patients ≥18 years of age with atraumatic OHCA, established 
intravenous or intraosseous vascular access, and persistent 
(nonterminating) or recurrent (restarting after successful ter-
mination) VF/VT after ≥1 shocks. Patients were randomized to 
licensed parenteral preparations of lidocaine, normal saline, 
or a captisol-based formulation of amiodarone (Nexterone, 
Baxter Healthcare). Protected populations; patients who had 
already received open-label intravenous amiodarone or lido-
caine during resuscitation, who had known hypersensitivity to 
these drugs, or who had advanced directives (do not resusci-
tate orders); or in whom VF/VT terminated before study drug 
could be administered were excluded from the trial.
Clinical Perspective
What Is New?
• Out-of-hospital cardiac arrest (OHCA) claims hun-
dreds of thousands of lives each year.
• Although historically OHCA commonly presented 
with ventricular fibrillation or pulseless ventricu-
lar tachycardia, it is now more often seen with 
nonshockable rhythms (asystole, pulseless electric 
activity).
• These rhythms can evolve to shock-refractory ven-
tricular fibrillation or pulseless ventricular tachycar-
dia during resuscitation in ≈25% of patients, for 
whom the effectiveness of antiarrhythmic drugs is 
unknown.
• This trial prospectively randomized 1063 such 
patients to amiodarone, lidocaine, or a placebo.
• A statistically insignificant trend toward better sur-
vival was found in drug than placebo recipients 
without increased risk of adverse events or neuro-
logical disability.
What Are the Clinical Implications?
• OHCA because of nonshockable rhythms is poor 
but not invariably fatal.
• When nonshockable OHCA turns shockable, abso-
lute differences in survival in response to lidocaine 
or amiodarone as compared with placebo are con-
sistent with the favorable trends in response to 
these drugs seen among patients in whom OHCA 
is caused by initial ventricular fibrillation or pulse-
less ventricular tachycardia.
• Taken together, these findings, although not defin-
itive, may signal a clinical benefit from antiarrhyth-
mic medications when shock-refractory ventricular 
fibrillation arises at any time and from any OHCA 
rhythm during the course of resuscitation.
• The role of antiarrhythmic drugs in shock-refractory 
OHCA invites further investigation.

ORIGINAL RESEARCH 
ARTICLE
The trial protocol specified that only patients who met 
clinical eligibility criteria and received any dose of study drug 
for ongoing shock-refractory VF/VT at any time during the 
resuscitation would be included in the analysis. Outcomes in 
the primary analysis population (composed of study-eligible 
drug recipients with confirmed VF/VT as the presenting cause 
of OHCA) and in all randomized patients by intention to treat 
(regardless of whether study eligible or having received drug) 
were previously reported, along with a listing of all participat-
ing EMS agencies and personnel.8 The focus of the current 
study, the population of randomized study-eligible drug recip-
ients whose initial OHCA was nonshockable but subsequently 
developed shock-refractory VF/VT, has not been previously 
characterized.
Definitions
Rhythms were identified from defibrillator recordings using 
cutaneous defibrillator electrodes that approximated a lead 
II configuration and were later reviewed manually by trained 
study personnel. A shockable versus nonshockable initial 
rhythm was determined by a shock versus no-shock advisory 
from an automated external defibrillator or by manual review 
of the electronic recording. PEA was defined as any orga-
nized ventricular rhythm (exclusive of ventricular tachycardia) 
with an absent pulse, asystole by absence of any ventricular 
rhythm or at most a single ventricular complex over a 6-sec-
ond interval. VF was defined as irregular, disorganized ven-
tricular electric activity of variable amplitude and ventricular 
tachycardia as an organized rhythm with a wide QRS interval 
(≥120 ms) without associated P waves at a rate of >150 beats 
per minute. The incident call was defined as the initial contact 
with the Public Safety Answering Point, which served as the 
emergency call center in each locality and represented the 
initial activation of EMS for the OHCA event. The incident call 
to EMS arrival was defined as the time interval from this call 
to the first arriving EMS vehicle at the street address of the 
OHCA event.
Design and Intervention
Trial drugs were packaged in sealed kits, each holding 3 iden-
tically formulated syringes of study drug, and each syringe 
containing 150 mg of amiodarone, 60 mg of lidocaine, or 
normal saline. Amiodarone, lidocaine, and normal saline 
(placebo) kits and respective syringes were indistinguishable 
except by a numeric code and were randomly distributed 
to EMS providers in equal ratios of 1:1:1. Randomization 
was stratified by participating Resuscitation Outcomes 
Consortium site and EMS agency in permuted blocks of 
concealed size.
Patients were treated in accordance with local EMS 
protocols and American Heart Association Advanced Life 
Support Guidelines in place at the time of the trial’s con-
duct.11 The subsequent opening of a study kit by EMS per-
sonnel constituted a patient’s enrollment in the trial, whose 
masked contents (amiodarone, lidocaine, or placebo) 
determined his or her randomized treatment assignment. 
Two syringes were initially administered as a rapid bolus 
(1 syringe if the estimated body weight was <100 pounds 
[45 kg]), followed by standard resuscitation measures and 
shock(s). If VF/VT persisted, then a single supplemental 
syringe of the same assigned study drug was administered, 
followed by standard interventions according to local prac-
tice, exclusive of any open-label amiodarone or lidocaine 
before hospitalization.
All trial interventions were completed before patients’ hos-
pital arrival. Hospital care providers were informed about the 
trial but not treatment assignment unless emergency unblind-
ing was requested, in which case it was provided strictly to 
the treating physician. Hospital care was not standardized, 
although its components were monitored.
Outcomes
The primary outcome of the trial was survival to hospital dis-
charge. The secondary outcome was survival to discharge 
with favorable neurological functional status, defined on the 
modified Rankin scale (mRS) (ranging from 0, no symptoms, 
to 6, death) as ≤3, meaning being able to conduct activities 
of daily living independently or with minimal assistance,12 
and adverse drug-related effects. These effects were defined 
as those previously reported with these medications that 
occurred within 24 hours of their administration, including 
anaphylaxis, thrombophlebitis requiring treatment, clinical 
seizures, and bradycardia requiring temporary cardiac pacing. 
Other prespecified mechanistic outcomes included return of 
spontaneous circulation, survival to hospital admission, and 
responses to treatment (number of shocks and need for ancil-
lary therapies).
Statistics
The previously reported primary analysis trial was powered 
to detect an absolute improvement of 6% in survival to 
hospital discharge from amiodarone versus placebo among 
treatment recipients with OHCA because of initial VF/VT; dif-
ferences between lidocaine versus placebo and amiodarone 
versus lidocaine were secondary comparisons.8 Although 
not its main focus, patients with late-occurring VF/VT were 
included in the trial for both pragmatic and scientific rea-
sons. Pragmatically, the dynamic nature of cardiac rhythms 
during resuscitation made it infeasible to acutely discrimi-
nate early from later occurring VF/VT without giving con-
fusing treatment directives to paramedic providers, which 
might only serve to impede patient care. Based on previous 
work, survival in this population was expected to be direc-
tionally similar to patients with OHCA because of initial VF/
VT but poor regardless of antiarrhythmic drug administra-
tion.13,14 Although recognized as underpowered, this analy-
sis was prespecified to collect valuable information about 
the efficacy and safety of therapies that are often given 
under similar circumstances in clinical practice, which the 
trial was designed to represent. As such, finding a signal 
of potential benefit could serve to justify and inform more 
definitive future studies.
Because of potential imbalances in the characteristics 
between treatment arms in this population, we conducted 
multiple logistic regression to evaluate the trial’s main end 
points of survival and neurological outcome at hospital dis-
charge, adjusting for age, sex, arrest etiology (presumed 
cardiac versus not), arrest location (public versus private), 
bystander- or EMS-witnessed status of the OHCA, provi-
sion of bystander cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR), the

incident call to EMS arrival interval, and trial site. Multiple 
imputation analysis (with 20 imputed data sets) was used to 
address any incomplete covariate data, using the mice pack-
age in R to minimize the potential bias of estimates compared 
with analyses limited to only cases with complete data.15–17 
Adjusted complete case analyses were also performed as an 
added sensitivity analysis of the imputation model. We tested 
for treatment differences according to the initial rhythm (PEA 
versus asystole) by adding an interaction term between the 
study arm and initial rhythm. P values were 2-sided, with sta-
tistical significance defined as an alpha of 0.05. Given the 
exploratory nature of the analyses, no adjustments were 
made for multiple comparisons.
The trial was approved by institutional review boards of all 
participating sites, with oversight by the US Food and Drug 
Administration and Health Canada and monitored by an inde-
pendent data and safety board appointed by the National 
Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute. All the authors have read 
and approved the manuscript.
RESULTS
Patients
Enrollment for the trial began on May 7, 2012, and was 
completed on October 25, 2015. Of 37 
889 patients 
with nontraumatic OHCA, 7903 had initial VF/VT (3026 
of these were previously reported randomized recipi-
ents of study drug), and 29 
986 had an initially non-
shockable arrest rhythm, 1864 of whom subsequently 
developed VF/VT that was refractory to ≥1 shock(s) 
(Figure 1). Of these patients, 1320 were randomized 
to drug treatment, of whom 1063 with known treat-
ment assignment remained study-eligible with ongoing 
episodes of VF/VT at time of treatment and constituted 
the primary analysis group for this study. In all, 389 
patients received amiodarone, 358 patients received li-
docaine, and 316 patients received placebo. Outcome 
was known in 1061 (99.8%), and 1032 (97%) had 
complete covariate data.
Among the 1063 randomized patients, the initial 
nonshockable OHCA rhythm was PEA in 400 (38%), 
asystole in 587 (55%), and not characterized in 76 (7%) 
patients. Patients (mean±SD) were 64.5±16.5 years of 
age, 70% were men, 44.7% had a bystander-witnessed 
OHCA, 14.7% occurred in a public location, and 46.1% 
received bystander CPR. The time from the incident call 
to EMS arrival (mean±SD) was 6.1±2.8 minutes, to first 
EMS shock 20.7±8.3 minutes, and to receipt of study 
drugs 26.9±8.9 minutes, which were administered af-
ter 2.2±1.1 shocks. These baseline and resuscitation 
event characteristics were generally balanced across ac-
tive drug and placebo treatment arms, except for fewer 
men and a lower frequency of bystander CPR in the 
placebo arms among patients with initial PEA group 
and in the combined group with initially nonshockable-
turned-shockable rhythms (Table 1).
Hospital Care
No significant differences in subsequent care were ob-
served between treatment arms among patients who 
survived to hospital admission (Table 2). In the com-
bined group of nonshockable-turned-shockable OHCA, 
≥50% of hospitalized patients received targeted tem-
perature management and early coronary catheteriza-
tion. Life-sustaining therapies were limited or with-
drawn in ≈30% of patients within the first 3 days after 
their OHCA and in ≈50% of patients overall.
Outcome
Unadjusted survival to hospital discharge among the 
1061 of 1063 study-drug recipients with known out-
come was 1.9% in the placebo arm, 3.1% in the li-
docaine arm, and 4.1% in the amiodarone arm, and 
although reflecting 1.5- to 2-fold relative differences in 
outcome was not statistically significant (P=0.24) (Ta-
ble 2). Patients who survived to hospital discharge had 
a mean mRS score of 3±2 (median 3), 52% of whom 
were discharged with an mRS ≤3 without significant 
differences between treatment arms (Table 3). Among 
1309 patients with known treatment assignment and 
outcome from the 1312 patients in the intention-to-
treat population (Figure 1), 19 of 466 of those ran-
domized to amiodarone (4.1%), 15 of 440 to lidocaine 
(3.4%), and 13 of 403 to placebo (3.2%) survived to 
hospital discharge, which did not significantly differ 
among treatment groups. These differences were un-
derstandably attenuated by changes in patients’ eligi-
bility for drug treatment after initial randomization.
Adjusted Analyses
In multiple imputation-adjusted analyses of the com-
bined group of randomized study drug-treated pa-
tients with an initial nonshockable-turned shockable 
OHCA, the absolute difference in survival to hospital 
discharge when treated with amiodarone versus pla-
cebo was 2.3% (95% confidence interval [CI], ‒0.3to 
4.8%; P=0.08) and for lidocaine versus placebo was 
1.2% (95% CI, ‒1.1 to 3.6; P=0.30). Similar relation-
ships were observed for the secondary end point of 
survival with an mRS ≤3 in each of the case models 
and rhythm groups (Table 4). Differences between 
amiodarone and lidocaine in any of these outcomes 
were not statistically significant (data not shown). No-
tably, the relationships between treatment arm and 
outcome were not different according to the initial 
rhythm (asystole or PEA) (P=0.87 test for interaction). 
In addition, no interaction was found between treat-
ment arm and whether the initial OHCA rhythm was 
shockable (VF/VT)8 or became shockable (nonshock-
able-turned-shockable) during the course of resuscita-

tion on outcome (P=0.84 test for interaction). That is, 
from a survival perspective, whether the initial rhythm 
was asystole, PEA, or VF/VT did not significantly alter 
the response to antiarrhythmic treatment. Although 
not statistically different, survival trends all favored use 
of either antiarrhythmic agent (Figure 2).
Mechanistic Outcomes
After randomization, placebo recipients were more like-
ly to require an additional blinded dose of study drug 
and a greater number of shocks than active drug (amio-
darone or lidocaine) treatment arms (P<0.05) (Table 2). 
As an ancillary antiarrhythmic drug, magnesium was 
more commonly administered to patients in the place-
bo than active drug treatment arms in patients with ini-
tial asystole and in the combined nonshockable rhythm 
group (P<0.05). The use of vasopressin was infrequent 
and along with other resuscitation medications (bicar-
bonate, atropine, procainamide, and beta blockers) did 
not differ significantly among treatment arms in any of 
the rhythm groups. Epinephrine was administered to 
virtually all study patients who received a mean (±SD) 
cumulative dose of 5.6±2.6 mg that was similar across 
treatment arms (Table 2). In the combined group of 
nonshockable-turned-shockable OHCA, the likelihood 
of obtaining any return of spontaneous circulation (ei-
ther transient or sustained) was lower among patients 
receiving amiodarone than in patients receiving lido-
caine or placebo (31.5% versus 40.5% and 37.3% of 
patients, respectively; P=0.05). No significant differ-
ences were seen in the time interval from the incident 
call to initial (first) return of spontaneous circulation 
among the treatment groups (Table 3). Similarly, the in-
terval from the incident call to termination of resuscita-
tion efforts among patients who were not transported 
to the hospital averaged (±SD) 45±10.7 minutes and 
did not differ significantly among treatment groups or 
by the presenting nonshockable rhythm. Unadjusted 
survival to hospital admission was significantly lower 
in patients receiving amiodarone than those receiving 
lidocaine and placebo across each of the initial non-
shockable rhythm groups. In the combined group of 
nonshockable-turned-shockable OHCA, 64 (16.5%) 
patients receiving amiodarone versus 74 (20.7%) pa-
tients receiving lidocaine and 65 (20.6%) patients re-

ceiving a placebo were admitted alive to the hospital 
(P<0.05) (Table 3).
Adverse Drug-Related Events
Adverse drug-related events, either overall or consid-
ered categorically (including thrombophlebitis, anaphy-
laxis, clinical seizures, and the need for temporary car-
diac pacing within the first 24 hours of treatment) did 
not differ significantly in frequency between treatment 
arms in the initial nonshockable-turned-shockable 
rhythm group (Table 2).
DISCUSSION
In this prospective, randomized trial, we found that out-
come after nonshockable-turned-shockable OHCA was 
poor but not invariably fatal or neurologically devastat-
ing. Of the 33 survivors (3.1%), >50% had a favorable 
functional recovery at hospital discharge (mRS ≤3). Al-
though the differences did not achieve statistical signifi-
cance, patients treated with amiodarone or lidocaine 
experienced up to a doubling of survival over placebo 
without greater risk of adverse effects or functional dis-
ability. These findings were consistent with the trends 
toward better survival observed after active-drug treat-
ment of patients who presented with an initial OHCA 
rhythm of VF/VT (Figure 2).8 Taken together, these find-
ings may signal a therapeutic benefit from amiodarone 
and lidocaine when shock-refractory VF/VT arises at any 
time or from any OHCA rhythm along the course of 
resuscitation.
Previous Studies
Compared with an initial rhythm of VF/VT, nonshock-
able OHCA because of asystole or PEA carries an omi-
nous prognosis for which no treatment apart from 
high-quality CPR has yet proven to be effective.18–21 The 
comorbidities associated with nonshockable cardiac ar-
rest, the lower treatment responsiveness of the rhythms 
themselves, and the circumstances under which the 
OHCA occurs may all contribute to this poor outcome. 
For example, compared with patients presenting with 
an initial VF/VT rhythm in the main study,8 patients in 
the current study were older, were less likely to present 
with OHCA in a public setting, were less likely to be 
bystander-witnessed or receive bystander CPR, and had 
a longer interval from the incident call to EMS arrival, all 
factors associated with poor survival.22,23
Overall survival in this study fell in the same range re-
ported by others when nonshockable OHCA evolves to 
VF/VT.6,24 Previous studies have variably observed prog-
nosis to be improved, worsened, or indifferent to an 
arrhythmia’s evolution from nonshockable to shockable 
depending on the clinical presentation. For example, 
survival was found to be better after conversion of a 
nonshockable rhythm to VF/VT when the antecedent 
rhythm was asystole rather than PEA,25 if shock was ad-
ministered sooner on its occurrence,26 or in the context 
of a history of cardiovascular disease.6 Others found no 
apparent association between outcome and patient or 
resuscitation characteristics,27 or they suggested that 
worse outcomes might result from providers placing a 
greater emphasis on rhythm analysis and shock than on 
the greater need for uninterrupted CPR in such circum-
stances.14 Because the use of antiarrhythmic medica-
tions was not reported in these studies, whether and 
how their administration might have contributed to 
these disparate findings and shaped the outcome of 
the patients are unknown. This issue has been largely 
unexplored until now.
Two previous randomized clinical trials of OHCA be-
cause of shock-refractory VF/VT also included patients 
in whom antiarrhythmic drugs were administered af-
ter conversion of initial asystole or PEA arrest to VF/VT. 
Unlike our findings, each reported numerically higher 
rates of hospital admission with amiodarone than with

‡The incident call was defined as the initial contact with the Public Safety Answering Point that served as the emergency call center in each locality and represented 
the initial activation of EMS for the out-of-hospital cardiac arrest (OHCA) event. The incident call to 1st EMS arrival was defined as the time interval from this call to 
the first arriving EMS vehicle at the street address of the OHCA event.

the lower rates of any return of spontaneous circula-
tion and survival to hospital admission with amioda-
rone than with lidocaine or placebo observed in our 
study may signal a real effect, whereby amiodarone 
adversely affects return of circulation. Alternatively, the

comparisons performed. It is important to note that al-
though the prospect of harm was not entirely excluded, 
patients who received amiodarone in this study experi-
enced no obvious worsening of survival to discharge, 
highlighting the potential challenge of drawing clinical 
inference from intermediate or surrogate outcomes in 
resuscitation research.
Because treatment of late-occurring arrhythmias is 
invariably administered late, the resulting delay in re-
storing circulation may be another factor contributing 
to poor outcomes in this population.29 In a previous re-
port, survival only improved on conversion of asystole 
or PEA to VF/VT when the interval from the incident call 
to shock was ≤20 minutes.26 In the current study, the 
time from the incident call to the first shock in the non-
shockable-turned-shockable group averaged nearly 21 
minutes, and nearly 27 minutes transpired before their 
receipt of study drug. This long interval and its conse-
quence on the patient’s physiology may have diluted 
a benefit from active drugs that might have occurred 
with earlier treatment.
Adverse Events
Because of conduction slowing and other rhythm-
suppressive properties, it is possible that the adminis-
tration of antiarrhythmic drugs for VF/VT, particularly 
in patients whose preceding rhythm was asystole or 
PEA, could theoretically lead to greater harm, includ-
ing a recrudescence or worsening of bradyarrhyth-
mias. Such adverse effects were not appreciated in 
this study because a significantly greater need for 
temporary pacing was not seen in the aftermath of 
drug treatment. Further, significant differences were 
not found in the incidence of other adverse drug-re-
lated events across the 3 treatment arms in this non-
shockable-turned-shockable OHCA cohort (Table 2). A 
greater need for temporary cardiac pacing in patients 
receiving amiodarone than lidocaine or a placebo was 
reported previously among patients with OHCA be-
cause of initial VF/VT, although the increment was rela-
tively small.8
Limitations
This trial evaluated the risks and benefits of amiodarone 
and lidocaine (versus placebo) in a high-risk population 
in whom survival was expected to be poor regardless of 
treatment, and the study was intended to explore but 
was not robustly powered to prove clinical effects. We 
did not observe a statistically significant survival differ-
ence among the treatment arms. However, the consis-

tent trends toward improved survival could also be inter-
preted as potential signals of benefit from active-drug 
treatment. If amiodarone or lidocaine achieved a true 
absolute improvement in survival of 2% over placebo as 
seen in this study, then a trial of ≈3000 patients would 
be required to establish this benefit with 90% power.
The trial was also not powered to make direct com-
parisons between the effectiveness of amiodarone and 
lidocaine. Thus, although point estimates and statisti-
cal trends tended to favor a stronger effect from amio-
darone than lidocaine on survival, these differences do 
not necessarily imply the superiority of 1 drug over the 
other. Similarly, the absence of significant differences 
in the incidence of adverse drug-related effects across 
treatment arms does not completely preclude this pos-
sibility, although our findings indicate their overall fre-
quency was low.
Comorbid conditions that might have contributed to 
OHCA and its outcome were not assessed in the study 
population, and although this study had a random-
ized design, we cannot confirm that treatment groups 
were balanced in all respects. In addition, hospital treat-
ments, although monitored, were not controlled and 
might have influenced outcomes. Nevertheless, we did 
not observe differences in prognostic hospital treat-
ments across the groups. The primary end point of the 
trial was survival to hospital discharge, which could be 
reliably ascertained in virtually all study patients. Al-
though arguably more meaningful, 30-day or 1-year 
survival can be more challenging to obtain and, being 
less complete, potentially more subject to bias. These 
limitations should be balanced with the strengths of 
the study. The results were derived from a large popu-
lation of patients with OHCA who were prospectively 
randomized in a double-blind trial design and system-
atically assessed, and involved analyses that accounted 
for important confounders.
Implications
Shock-refractory VF/VT as a primary or secondary event 
continues to be a frequently encountered arrhythmia 
during resuscitation. If ineffective, the added cost and 
needless distraction created by antiarrhythmic drugs 
such as amiodarone and lidocaine argues against their 
continued use in such patients. However, if effective, 
improving absolute survival by merely 2% in this pa-
tient population means >1000 additional lives might be 
saved each year in North America from nonshockable-
turned-shockable OHCA alone, many of whom will be 
functionally independent or require minimal assistance 
with daily living.
Conclusions
Outcome from nonshockable-turned shockable OHCA 
is poor but not invariably fatal. Although the differ-
ences were not statistically significant, point estimates 
for survival were higher among patients randomized 
to amiodarone or lidocaine than to a placebo, with-
out increased risk of adverse drug-related effects or 
functional disability. These results are consistent with 
previously reported trends toward better survival from 
antiarrhythmic drug treatment when OHCA initially 
presents as shock-refractory VF/VT. Taken together, the 
findings may signal a clinical benefit from amiodarone 
or lidocaine when shock-refractory VF/VT arises at any 
time or from any OHCA rhythm along the course of 
resuscitation and invites further investigation.
