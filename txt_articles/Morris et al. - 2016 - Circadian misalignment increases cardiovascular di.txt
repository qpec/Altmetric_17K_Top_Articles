Shift work is a risk factor for hypertension, inflammation, and
cardiovascular disease. This increased risk cannot be fully explained by
classic risk factors. One of the key features of shift workers is that their
behavioral and environmental cycles are typically misaligned relative
to their endogenous circadian system. However, there is little in-
formation on the impact of acute circadian misalignment on cardio-
vascular disease risk in humans. Here we show—by using two 8-
d laboratory protocols—that short-term circadian misalignment (12-
h inverted behavioral and environmental cycles for three days) ad-
versely affects cardiovascular risk factors in healthy adults. Circadian
misalignment increased 24-h systolic blood pressure (SBP) and dia-
stolic blood pressure (DBP) by 3.0 mmHg and 1.5 mmHg, respectively.
These results were primarily explained by an increase in blood pres-
sure during sleep opportunities (SBP, +5.6 mmHg; DBP, +1.9 mmHg)
and, to a lesser extent, by raised blood pressure during wake periods
(SBP, +1.6 mmHg; DBP, +1.4 mmHg). Circadian misalignment de-
creased wake cardiac vagal modulation by 8–15%, as determined
by heart rate variability analysis, and decreased 24-h urinary epineph-
rine excretion rate by 7%, without a significant effect on 24-h urinary
norepinephrine excretion rate. Circadian misalignment increased 24-h
serum interleukin-6, C-reactive protein, resistin, and tumor necrosis
factor-α levels by 3–29%. We demonstrate that circadian misalignment
per se increases blood pressure and inflammatory markers. Our find-
ings may help explain why shift work increases hypertension, inflam-
mation, and cardiovascular disease risk.

n the United States, almost 15% of the workforce undertakes
shift work (1). Epidemiological studies indicate that shift work
is a risk factor for elevated blood pressure, hypertension, and
cardiovascular disease, even after controlling for traditional risk
factors (2–6). These findings raise the question of what the un-
derlying mechanism is. Shift workers frequently undergo circa-
dian misalignment (i.e., misalignment between the endogenous
circadian system and 24-h environmental/behavioral cycles). This
misalignment has been proposed to explain, in part, why shift
work has been reported to be a risk factor for elevated blood
pressure, hypertension, and cardiovascular disease (7).
Humans—as well as most other life on Earth—possess an
endogenous circadian system that optimally synchronizes physi-
ology and behavior to the solar day (8–10). The mammalian
endogenous circadian system consists of the suprachiasmatic
nucleus in the hypothalamus and circadian oscillators in virtually
all peripheral tissues and organs (8–10). At the molecular level,
transcriptional-translation feedback loops are involved in gen-
erating intrinsic circadian rhythms (8–10). We have previously
shown that circadian misalignment—caused by participants liv-
ing on a 28-h behavioral cycle under dim light conditions (forced
desynchrony protocol)—increases wake blood pressure (11).
However, real-life shift workers do not live on 28-h days in dim
light (continuous exposure to dim light further slows down the
adjustment of the suprachiasmatic nucleus to the new behavioral
cycle). Moreover, we did not assess the impact of circadian
misalignment on sleep blood pressure, which is a better predictor
of adverse cardiovascular events and all-cause mortality than
wake blood pressure (12). Inflammatory markers also strongly
predict cardiovascular disease risk (13–15) and have been shown
to be elevated in shift workers compared with day workers (16–18).
However, to our knowledge, only two laboratory studies have
assessed the impact of circadian misalignment on inflammatory
markers in humans. The first study demonstrated that 8 d of sleep
restriction combined with multiple days of circadian misalignment
increased C-reactive protein (CRP) levels—a marker of systemic
inflammation (19). The second study demonstrated that weeks of
gradual changes in circadian misalignment (induced by 24.6-h be-
havioral cycles in dim light) increased CRP, tumor necrosis factor
(TNF)-α (proinflammatory) and interleukin (IL)-10 (antiin-
flammatory) levels (20). The relevance of the findings of the
latter study to shift workers is unclear, considering that shift
workers are not kept in dim light conditions (night workers have
been reported to be exposed to ∼50–300 lx during night shifts
and natural environmental illumination of varying strength) and
typically undergo rapid and large shifts of their behavioral/en-
vironmental cycles relative to their internal circadian system—that
is, due to the inertia of the internal circadian system, the timing of
the circadian system cannot quickly adjust to large and rapid shifts
in behavioral/environmental cycles (21). The impact of circadian
misalignment under simulated night work conditions on blood
pressure and inflammatory markers remains poorly understood.
Thus, we tested the impact of circadian misalignment, similar
to that experienced by real-life shift workers, on 24-h levels of
Significance
Shift work is a risk factor for hypertension, inflammation, and
cardiovascular disease, even after controlling for traditional risk
factors. Shift workers frequently undergo circadian misalignment
(i.e., misalignment between the endogenous circadian system
and 24-h environmental/behavioral cycles). This misalignment
has been proposed to explain, in part, why shift work is a risk
factor for hypertension, inflammation, and cardiovascular
disease. However, the impact of circadian misalignment per
se on 24-h blood pressure and inflammatory markers is poorly
understood. We show—under highly controlled laboratory
conditions—that short-term circadian misalignment increases
24-h blood pressure and inflammatory markers in healthy
adults. Our findings may help explain why shift work increases
hypertension, inflammation, and cardiovascular disease risk.

 blood pressure and the inflammatory markers CRP, IL-6, TNF-α,
and resistin, which are risk factors for cardiovascular disease (14,
15, 22–32). Furthermore, we tested the impact of circadian
misalignment on additional cardiovascular-related measures,
including autonomic nervous system activity (cardiac vagal
modulation and urinary epinephrine and norepinephrine) and
factors involved in fibrinolysis [plasminogen activator inhibitor-1
(PAI-1) and tissue-type plasminogen activator (tPA) activity]
(33, 34). To do so, we measured—using a randomized, within-
participant, cross-over design—blood pressure and inflammatory
markers across the 24-h behavioral and light/dark cycles when
the behavioral and environmental cycle (including sleep/wake,
fasting/feeding, rest/activity, and dark/light cycles) was aligned
and misaligned (after a rapid 12-h shift of the behavioral cycle)
with the endogenous circadian system (Fig. 1). Moreover, we
tested whether the impact of circadian misalignment was de-
pendent on exposure duration to circadian misalignment (acute
vs. repeated, test period 1 and 3, respectively) (Fig. 1). Based on
previously published 24-h melatonin data collected in test period
1 and 3 of both the circadian alignment and misalignment pro-
tocols of the current study, our circadian misalignment protocol
resulted in misalignment between the central circadian pace-
maker and the 24-h environmental and behavioral cycles (35).
Finally, we tested whether the effects of circadian misalignment
on our main outcome variables were mediated by the effects of
misalignment on sleep duration or were above and beyond any
misalignment effects on sleep duration.
Results
Circadian Misalignment Increased Blood Pressure (Fig. 2). Circadian
misalignment, compared with circadian alignment, increased 24-h
systolic blood pressure (SBP) by 3.0 mmHg and 24-h diastolic
blood pressure (DBP) by 1.5 mmHg (both P < 0.0001). Exposure
duration to circadian misalignment (test period 1 vs. test period 3)
did not significantly modulate the circadian misalignment effect
on SBP (P = 0.90), but did for DBP (P = 0.001). Circadian mis-
alignment increased 24-h DBP to a slightly larger extent during
test period 3 (+1.7 mmHg; P = 0.0002) compared with test period
1 (+1.4 mmHg; P = 0.001). The 24-h BP results seem primarily
explained by circadian misalignment increasing SBP during the
sleep opportunity by 5.6 mmHg and DBP during the sleep op-
portunity by 1.9 mmHg, and, to a lesser extent, by circadian mis-
alignment increasing wake-period SBP by 1.6 mmHg and DBP by
1.4 mmHg (all P ≤ 0.0004). The circadian misalignment effect was
not significantly dependent on exposure duration for wake-period
or sleep-opportunity SBP or wake-period DBP (all P ≥ 0.11).
However, the effect of circadian misalignment on sleep-opportu-
nity DBP was dependent on circadian misalignment exposure du-
ration (P = 0.001), with the increase slightly greater during test
period 1 (+2.2 mmHg; P = 0.002) compared with test period 3
(+1.6 mmHg; P = 0.031).
Circadian Misalignment Decreased Heart Rate During Wake Periods
and Increased Heart Rate During Sleep Opportunities (Fig. 2). There
was no significant effect of condition on 24-h heart rate (P =
0.20). However, there was an effect of circadian misalignment
exposure duration (P < 0.0001). Twenty-four-hour heart rate was
1.6 beats per minute higher in the circadian misalignment than
alignment condition during test period 1 (P = 0.021), without
significant difference during test period 3 (P = 0.61). Circadian
misalignment decreased wake-period heart rate by 0.9 beats per
minute and increased sleep-period heart rate by 3.6 beats per
minute (both P ≤ 0.008). These effects were dependent on ex-
posure duration to circadian misalignment (both P ≤ 0.019).
Wake-period heart rate was 1.5 beats per minute lower in the
circadian misalignment than alignment condition during test
period 3 (P = 0.011), without significant difference during test
period 1 (P = 0.23). Circadian misalignment increased sleep-
opportunity heart rate to a greater extent during test period 1
(+5.3 beats per minute; P < 0.0001) compared with test period 3
(+2.0 beats per minute; P = 0.014).
Circadian Misalignment Reduced the Sleep Opportunity-Associated
Dipping in Blood Pressure and Heart Rate (Fig. 3). Circadian mis-
alignment reduced SBP dipping during the sleep opportunity by
21% (P = 0.012), but had no significant impact on DBP dipping
(P = 0.19). Circadian misalignment also reduced heart rate dip-
ping during the sleep opportunity by 33% (P < 0.0001). These
findings were not significantly affected by circadian misalignment
exposure duration (all P ≥ 0.18).
Effect of Circadian Misalignment on 24-h Urinary Epinephrine and
Norepinephrine Excretion Rates (Fig. 4). Circadian misalignment
decreased 24-h urinary epinephrine excretion by 7% (P = 0.005)
but had no significant effect on 24-h urinary norepinephrine
excretion (P = 0.25). The epinephrine profile was dependent on
alignment condition (interaction of the factor alignment/mis-
alignment with time since wake; P < 0.0001); epinephrine was
higher during the sleep opportunity, no different a few hours
after scheduled wake, but lower for the remainder of scheduled
wake in the circadian misalignment than alignment condition,
causing a flattening of the rhythm. The norepinephrine profile
was not significantly different between alignment conditions (P =
0.26). None of the above effects were significantly dependent
on circadian misalignment exposure duration (all P ≥ 0.32). Of
note, circadian misalignment increased urinary epinephrine by

angle of gaze: ∼90 lx, to simulate typical room light intensity, ∼450 lx
during the first three baseline wake episodes to enhance circadian en-
trainment, 30-min periods of ∼450 lx to simulate the morning commute
both preceding the day work shift (circadian alignment protocol) and
after the night work shift (circadian misalignment protocol), ∼4 lx to
permit assessment of the dim-light melatonin onset, and 0 lx during
scheduled sleep episodes. Light blue bars represent meals (wide bar) and

 82% during the sleep opportunities in which blood pressure and
heart rate were measured (P = 0.004).
Circadian Misalignment Decreased Markers of Cardiac Vagal
Modulation (Fig. 5). Circadian misalignment decreased the root
mean square differences of consecutive heartbeat intervals
(RMSSD) by 11% and the percentage of consecutive heartbeat
intervals differing by >20 ms (pNN20) by 8% (both P ≤ 0.037),
reflecting a decrease in cardiac vagal modulation. There was no
significant effect of circadian misalignment on pNN50 (P = 0.10)
(Fig. S1). The circadian misalignment effects on RMSSD,
pNN20, and pNN50 were dependent on circadian misalignment
exposure duration (all P ≤ 0.027). RMSSD was 15% lower in the
circadian misalignment than alignment condition during test
period 1 (P = 0.025) and without difference during test period 3
(P = 0.49). There were statistical trends for pNN20 (P = 0.053)
and pNN50 (P = 0.054) to be lower in the circadian misalignment
than alignment condition during test period 1 and to be without
significant difference during test period 3 (both P ≥ 0.29).
Circadian Misalignment Increased Inflammatory Markers (Figs. 6 and 7).
Circadian misalignment increased 24-h IL-6 by 15% (P = 0.014).
This effect was dependent on circadian misalignment exposure
duration (P < 0.0001), with levels being 29% higher in the circa-
dian misalignment than alignment condition during test period 1
(P = 0.001) and without a difference during test period 3 (P = 0.92).
The 24-h IL-6 profile was dependent on alignment condition (P =
0.028), with levels being higher in the early part of the wake period
in the circadian misalignment condition, compared with the cir-
cadian alignment condition; this difference was not significantly
dependent on circadian misalignment exposure duration (P = 0.99).
Circadian misalignment increased 24-h CRP, resistin, and TNF-α
by 7%, 5%, and 3%, respectively (all P ≤ 0.030). There was no
significant effect of circadian misalignment on the 24-h profiles
of CRP, resistin, or TNF-α (all P ≥ 0.050). None of the circadian
misalignment effects on CRP, resistin, or TNF-α were signifi-
cantly dependent on circadian misalignment exposure duration
(all P ≥ 0.11).
Circadian Misalignment Decreased PAI-1 Levels (Fig. 8). Circadian
misalignment decreased 24-h PAI-1 by 11% (P = 0.014). This
effect was dependent on circadian misalignment exposure duration
(P = 0.037), with no effect of alignment condition during test pe-
riod 1 (P = 0.77), but with circadian misalignment decreasing 24-h
PAI-1 levels by 21% on test period 3 (P = 0.002). The 24-h PAI-1
profile was dependent on alignment condition (P < 0.0001), with
lower levels at the end of the sleep opportunity and the beginning
of the wake period, and higher levels during the latter half of the
wake period and the start of the sleep opportunity, causing a
flattening of the rhythm. The profile differences were dependent

 on circadian misalignment exposure duration (P = 0.025), reflecting
that PAI-1 levels were higher at the end of the wake period during
test period 1 but not during test period 3. Circadian misalignment
had no significant effect on 24-h tPA activity or its profile, regardless
of exposure duration (all P ≥ 0.069; n = 6).
Within-Participant Correlations and Mediation Analyses. We have
previously reported that circadian misalignment decreased
polysomnography (PSG)-assessed total sleep duration by 56 min
in the current protocol (35). To investigate to what degree the
observed effects of circadian misalignment on cardiovascular risk
markers were related to changes in total sleep duration, we used
PSG sleep recordings and actigraphic sleep recordings. We
assessed whether PSG sleep recordings (on sleep periods 4 and 6
for the alignment protocol and sleep periods 5 and 7 for the
misalignment protocol) were correlated with cardiovascular risk
markers during the 24-h assessments (inflammatory makers) or
measured during the subsequent wake periods (blood pressure
and heart rate). We also tested whether actigraphic estimates of
sleep (on sleep opportunities 5 and 7 for the alignment/mis-
alignment protocol and sleep opportunities 6 and 8 for the
alignment/misalignment protocol) were correlated with blood
pressure and heart rate measured during the same sleep op-
portunities (PSG was not assessed simultaneously with the blood
pressure assessments). There was no correlation between PSG-
assessed total sleep duration and SBP, DBP, or heart rate during
the subsequent wake period (all P ≥ 0.50). Actigraphy-assessed
total sleep duration was negatively correlated with SBP during
the same sleep opportunity (r = −0.27; P = 0.035), but not
correlated with DBP or heart rate during the same sleep op-
portunity (both P ≥ 0.16). Mediation analysis indicated that the
circadian misalignment-mediated increase in SBP during the
sleep opportunity was partially mediated by the circadian mis-
alignment-mediated decrease in total sleep duration as assessed
by actigraphy, and partially independent of changes in total sleep
duration. That is, misalignment increased sleep-opportunity
SBP (standardized β = 0.37, P < 0.0001) even when including
actigraphy-assessed total sleep duration (standardized β = −0.25,
P < 0.0002) in the model. PSG-assessed total sleep duration was
negatively correlated with 24-h TNF-α levels (r = −0.24, P =
0.038), but not correlated with 24-h IL-6, CRP, or resistin levels
(all P ≥ 0.17). In subsequent mediation analysis for TNF-α, the
effects of circadian misalignment and PSG-assessed total sleep
duration were both nonsignificant (both P ≥ 0.21), possibly be-
cause of insufficient statistical power.
Sleep-opportunity urinary epinephrine excretion rate—measured
across the same sleep periods in which blood pressure was
assessed—was positively correlated with sleep-opportunity SBP
(r = 0.37, P = 0.002), but not sleep-opportunity DBP (P = 0.069).
Mediation analysis indicated that the circadian misalignment-
mediated increase in sleep-opportunity SBP was partially medi-
ated by the circadian misalignment-mediated increase in sleep-
opportunity urinary epinephrine excretion rate (standardized β =
0.19, P < 0.0001) and partially independently by circadian mis-
alignment (standardized β = 0.24, P = 0.0002). There was no
within-participant correlation between wake-period SBP or DBP
and cardiac vagal markers RMSSD and pNN20 (all P ≥ 0.11).
Discussion
We found that short-term circadian misalignment, resulting from
a rapid 12-h inversion of the behavioral cycle (including the
sleep/wake and fasting/feeding cycle) and which is typical in shift
workers, increased 24-h blood pressure. The magnitude of the
effect of circadian misalignment on 24-h blood pressure was
similar to that reported in a Dietary Approaches to Stop Hy-
pertension (DASH) study and the individual impact of some
antihypertensive drugs (36, 37). The circadian misalignment-
mediated increase in blood pressure may be clinically important
considering that there is an increased risk of cardiovascular
disease with progressive elevations in blood pressure, beginning
at normal blood pressure levels (32). The adverse effect of cir-
cadian misalignment on 24-h blood pressure was primarily a
result of an increase in blood pressure during sleep opportunities
rather than wake periods. Sleep blood pressure is a better pre-
dictor of adverse cardiovascular events and all-cause mortality
than wake blood pressure (12). Circadian misalignment also re-
duced SBP dipping during sleep opportunities. Reduced blood
pressure dipping during sleep is also an independent predictor of
adverse cardiovascular events and all-cause mortality (12). We
also found that circadian misalignment increased the in-
flammatory markers CRP, TNF-α, resistin, and IL-6. CRP is a
marker of systemic inflammation whereas TNF-α and resistin
have proinflammatory functions, and IL-6 has both pro- and

 antiinflammatory properties (38–40). It is now well-accepted that
inflammation has an important role in the development of car-
diovascular disease and that each of the inflammatory markers
we measured predicts cardiovascular disease (14, 15, 22–31).
Epidemiologic studies convincingly show an increased preva-
lence of cardiovascular disease in night workers versus day
workers, and field studies in shift workers have shown increased
blood pressure and inflammatory markers during or after night
work compared with day work or days off (41–45). However,
such studies can not definitively distinguish a possible causal role
of circadian misalignment in the observed adverse health effects
of shift work versus that of differences in other factors, such as
work stressors, dietary habits, and physical activity, as well as
family, financial, genetic, health, and social factors, etc. In the
current highly controlled, experimental, within-participant pro-
tocol, we could determine the influence of circadian misalignment
per se on cardiovascular and inflammatory risk factors, while
controlling these other factors. Our finding that circadian mis-
alignment per se increases blood pressure and inflammatory
markers provides evidence for circadian misalignment as an un-
derlying mechanism to explain why shift work is a risk factor for
hypertension and cardiovascular disease (2–6).
Possible Mechanisms Involved in Circadian Misalignment-Mediated
Increases in Blood Pressure and Inflammatory Markers. Experi-
mental studies show that short-term sleep restriction per se
increases daytime and nighttime blood pressure in normo-
tensive and hypertensive humans (46–49). Thus, we assessed
whether sleep duration in our study was associated with blood
pressure. Although PSG-assessed total sleep duration, mea-
sured immediately before the wake periods during which
blood pressure was recorded, was reduced by our circadian
misalignment protocol, we found no correlation with blood
pressure. Because no PSG recordings were performed con-
currently with blood pressure recordings during sleep op-
portunities, we also estimated total sleep duration via
actigraphy during the sleep opportunities in which blood
pressure was measured. Actigraphy-estimated total sleep dura-
tion was reduced during circadian misalignment and was nega-
tively correlated with sleep-opportunity SBP, but not with sleep-
opportunity DBP. Furthermore, mediation analysis indicated
that the circadian misalignment-mediated increase in sleep-
opportunity SBP was partially mediated by circadian misalignment
decreasing actigraphy-estimated total sleep duration and partially
independent of total sleep duration.

 To test the role of the autonomic nervous system in the in-
crease in blood pressure due to circadian misalignment, we de-
termined the effect of circadian misalignment on urinary
epinephrine and norepinephrine excretion rates as markers of
sympathetic activity and on heart rate variability as estimates of
parasympathetic cardiac modulation. Overall, circadian mis-
alignment decreased epinephrine excretion rate and markers
of parasympathetic tone but had no effect on norepinephrine
excretion rate. The decrease in parasympathetic measures could
help explain why circadian misalignment increased blood pres-
sure although we found no within-participant correlation
between wake-period blood pressure and the cardiac vagal mark-
ers. Of note, circadian misalignment increased epinephrine excre-
tion rate measured across the sleep opportunities in which blood
pressure was assessed, which was positively correlated with sleep-
opportunity SBP. Moreover, mediation analysis indicated that the
circadian misalignment-mediated increase in sleep-opportunity
SBP is partially explained by circadian misalignment increasing
sleep-opportunity epinephrine excretion rate.
In humans, melatonin and cortisol administration decrease
and increase blood pressure, respectively (50–52). Melatonin
and cortisol data from the current study have been previously
reported (35). We found that circadian misalignment decreased
mean 24-h melatonin levels but had no effect on mean 24-h
cortisol levels. Thus, the decrease in 24-h melatonin levels during
circadian misalignment may have contributed to the increased
blood pressure.
The endogenous circadian system causes blood pressure to
gradually rise from the biological morning to the evening and fall
across the biological night (53, 54). This circadian rhythm may
contribute to the fall in blood pressure observed during normally
timed sleep (at night). However, during our circadian mis-
alignment protocol, participants attempted to sleep across the
biological morning, afternoon, and evening, when the circadian
system is promoting an increase in blood pressure. This mis-
alignment between the circadian rhythm in blood pressure and
timing of the sleep opportunity may help explain the increased
sleep-opportunity blood pressure during circadian misalignment.
Experimental studies show that short-term sleep restriction
per se increases inflammatory markers, including IL-6, CRP, and
TNF-α (49, 55–57). We found a negative correlation between
PSG-assessed total sleep duration and 24-h TNF-α levels, but not
with 24-h IL-6, CRP, or resistin levels. Future studies are re-
quired to further test the relative contribution of changes in sleep
versus sleep-independent factors in the effects of misalignment
on inflammatory markers. We have no evidence that stress was a
causal factor in the effects of circadian misalignment on in-
flammatory markers or the other outcome variables. Indeed,

 average 24-h serum cortisol levels were not affected by circadian
misalignment in our study (35). Animal studies have shown that
circadian disruption by jet lag simulation exaggerates in-
flammatory responses that were also not explained by sleep loss
or stress measures and was suggested to be related to altered
clock gene expression in the central clock and peripheral
clocks (58).
Comparisons with Previous Research. In chronic shift workers, blood
pressure is higher, and the day/night blood pressure rhythm is
blunted while working night shifts compared with day shifts (41–
45). Such study designs can not isolate the independent effect of
circadian misalignment on blood pressure versus shift work-
induced changes in factors such as diet, physical activity, light
exposure, etc. We have previously shown that circadian mis-
alignment, resulting from a forced desynchrony protocol, increases
blood pressure measured during wakefulness (11). Here, we show
that circadian misalignment resulting from a rapid inversion of the
behavioral and light/dark cycle—typical in shift workers—increases
24-h blood pressure, both by increasing blood pressure during the
wake episode but primarily by increasing blood pressure during the
sleep opportunity. Furthermore, we demonstrate that circadian
misalignment decreased the SBP drop during the sleep opportu-
nity, reflecting a blunted 24-h SBP rhythm (i.e., “non-dipping”).
Manipulating the light/dark cycle and circadian clock genes have
also been reported to affect blood pressure in rodents (59–61).
It has been reported in chronic shift workers that cardiac
sympathetic modulation is decreased during night shifts com-
pared with day shifts (62). However, such a study can not de-
termine the independent effect of circadian misalignment on
autonomic nervous system activity versus shift work-induced
changes in factors such as work load, diet, physical activity, etc.
Here, we showed that circadian misalignment per se decreases
wake cardiac vagal modulation and increases epinephrine ex-
cretion rate during sleep opportunities.
Epidemiological studies have shown inflammatory markers to
be higher in shift workers than day workers (16–18). Moreover,
inflammatory markers have been shown to be higher after a night
shift than a day shift (63). Such epidemiological and field studies
can not determine the independent effect of circadian mis-
alignment on inflammation. Recently, it was shown that 8 d of
sleep restriction, including multiple days of circadian mis-
alignment, increased CRP levels in humans (19). This finding is in
accordance with the increase in CRP levels we observed as a result
of 3 d of circadian misalignment. Wright et al. (20) reported that
weeks of gradual changes in circadian alignment (induced by
24.6-h behavioral cycles under dim light) increased CRP as well
as TNF-α and IL-10 (antiinflammatory) levels in humans. However,
shift workers typically undergo rapid, large shifts of their behavioral
and light/dark cycles relative to their internal body clock, as oc-
curred in our study. We show that this type of circadian mis-
alignment not only increases CRP levels [as shown previously (19)]
but also increases TNF-α, IL-6, and resistin levels. Different forms
of circadian disruption (e.g., nighttime light exposure, shifting the
light/dark cycle) have also been shown to alter inflammatory
markers in rodents (58, 64).
PAI-1 is a prothrombotic protein. PAI-1 is the primary in-
hibitor of tPA and urokinase and is thus an inhibitor of fibri-
nolysis (breakdown of blood clots). PAI-1 levels are increased in
mice that undergo four consecutive weekly 6-h phase advances of
the light/dark cycle (65). We found that short-term circadian
misalignment decreases 24-h PAI-1 levels in humans. Circadian
misalignment caused an inversion of the 24-h PAI-1 rhythm
relative to the behavioral cycle, suggesting that PAI-1 is more
importantly controlled by the circadian cycle than by the be-
havioral/environmental cycle. This interpretation is consistent
with an important role for the circadian system in the regulation of
PAI-1 independent of the behavioral cycle, as we have previously
reported (66). Furthermore, the 24-h PAI-1 rhythm was severely
blunted after repeated circadian misalignment exposure, reminis-
cent of the blunting of the rhythm of the circadian markers melatonin
and cortisol in this protocol (35).

 Strengths, Limitations, and Future Directions. Strengths of our study
include the highly controlled laboratory protocol, which was able
to determine the independent impact of circadian misalignment—
similar to that typically experienced by shift workers—on car-
diovascular disease risk factors assessed repeatedly across 24 h.
Limitations of the study should also be considered. First, our
participants were healthy and had little or no shift work expe-
rience. The effect of circadian misalignment on cardiovascular
function and inflammatory markers may be different in people
with hypertension and in shift workers. Second, our sample size
was relatively small, although in keeping with similar highly
controlled, within-participant studies. Thus, we may have been
statistically underpowered to detect the impact of circadian mis-
alignment on some of the outcome variables. Moreover, we were
likely statistically underpowered to detect certain correlations
between circadian misalignment-mediated changes in our primary
outcome variables (e.g., blood pressure and inflammatory makers)
and circadian misalignment-mediated changes in our explanatory/
secondary outcome variables (i.e., sleep duration and autonomic
markers). Third, we investigated the effect of circadian mis-
alignment on a selection of cardiovascular- and inflammatory-
related variables. Further studies are needed to test the impact
of circadian misalignment on other cardiovascular (e.g., baro-
reflex sensitivity and endothelial function) and inflammatory
markers (e.g., IL-8 and monocyte chemoattractant protein-1).
Fourth, we assessed the impact only of short-term circadian
misalignment on cardiovascular disease risk factors. The in-
dependent effect of chronic circadian misalignment on car-
diovascular disease risk factors still needs to be studied. Future
studies are warranted to identify countermeasures for the ad-
verse effect of circadian misalignment on blood pressure and
inflammatory markers, such as timing of exercise and diet. For
example, we have shown that evening exercise decreases blood
pressure during a subsequent simulated night shift (67).
Summary
We demonstrate that circadian misalignment per se increases
blood pressure and inflammatory markers. Circadian mis-
alignment caused by rapidly shifting the behavioral and light/
dark cycles relative to the endogenous circadian system is typical
in shift workers. Thus, our findings may help explain why shift
work is a risk factor for elevated blood pressure, hypertension,
and cardiovascular disease.
Methods
Other aspects of this study—which was designed to test separate hypoth-
eses—have previously been published (35, 68).
Participants. Fourteen healthy, nonsmoking, drug- and medication-free
(except for oral contraceptives) adults completed this study [mean ± SD
(range) age, 28 ± 9 y (20–49 y); body mass index, 25.4 ± 2.6 kg/m2 (21–
29.5 kg/m2); eight men]. The Partners Human Research Committee approved
this research, which was conducted in the Center for Clinical Investigation
at Brigham and Women’s Hospital (Boston, MA). All participants provided
written informed consent. See SI Methods for details.
Experimental Protocol. Each participant underwent two 8-d laboratory pro-
tocols, according to a cross-over design, to test the impact of circadian
misalignment on cardiovascular disease risk factors (Fig. 1). One protocol
included circadian misalignment, and the other maintained circadian
alignment. The visits were separated by 2–8 wk [mean, 4 wk (SD, 2)].
“Minimization” was used to minimize imbalance—according to age, gender
and body mass index—in the order of laboratory visits (circadian alignment
protocol first, n = 7; circadian misalignment protocol first, n = 7) (69).
Preinpatient Study Conditions. Participants selected and maintained a normal
sleep/wake schedule, with an 8-h sleep opportunity, for ≥11 d [mean, 17 d (SD,
3)] before each laboratory visit. Compliance was assessed with wrist
actigraphy (Actiwatch Spectrum, Philips-Respironics; or Actiwatch-L, Mini
Mitter), sleep diary, and daily bedtime and wake time calls to a time-stamped
voicemail system [mean bedtime, 23:30 hh:mm (SD, 0:48); mean wake time,
7:21 hh:mm (SD, 0:41); data from seven sleep periods preceding the final
ambulatory sleep period before both inpatient admissions]. On the night
preceding each inpatient admission, participants were instructed to sleep
between 11:00 PM and 7:00 AM to aid the adaptation of participants’ en-
dogenous circadian system to the initial laboratory sleep/wake schedule
(sleep opportunity, 11:00 PM to 7:00 AM).
Inpatient Study Conditions. On the first day of each 8-d laboratory protocol,
participants were admitted to the Center for Clinical Investigation at ∼10:30 AM,
to undertake either the circadian alignment protocol or circadian mis-
alignment protocol, in a cross-over design (Fig. 1). Participants remained in a
private laboratory room throughout each laboratory protocol to allow strict
control of environmental conditions. Participants were not permitted to
exercise while in the laboratory. Participants completed computerized tests
each “day” in the laboratory. In the circadian alignment protocol, partici-
pants’ sleep opportunity occurred between 11:00 PM and 7:00 AM for days
1–8. In the circadian misalignment protocol, participants’ sleep opportunity
occurred between 11:00 PM and 7:00 AM for days 1–3. On day 4 of the
circadian misalignment protocol, participants’ behavioral cycle was shifted
by 12 h, and this inverted cycle was maintained until the end of that pro-
tocol (day 8). The 12-h shift on day 4 was achieved by including an 8-h wake
episode and a 4-h sleep opportunity, thereby maintaining the same sleep
opportunity to wake ratio (1:2) in the circadian alignment and misalignment
protocols. Light levels during the protocols are shown in Fig. 1.
Diet. Participants were given an ad libitum lunch around noon on the first day
of each laboratory protocol. Thereafter, participants received an isocaloric
diet, calculated according to the Harris–Benedict equation with an activity
factor of 1.4. The diet consisted of 45–50% carbohydrate, 30–35% fat, and
15–20% protein, 150 mEq Na+ (±20%), 100 mEq K+ (±20%), and at least
2.5 L of water per 24 h. Participants were instructed to consume all food
provided (verified by checking their food trays). Diet was identical within
each participant between laboratory visits, except for the required and
prorated additional food and water given during the 12-h behavioral cycle
(day 4) in the circadian misalignment protocol (50% of the intake compared
with the 24-h cycles). In the 24-h periods preceding test period 1 and 3 in the
circadian alignment and circadian misalignment protocol, the participants’
diet was identical, including the same exact meals (including the same cal-
ories, macronutrients, etc.) given at the same time relative to scheduled
awakening.
Twenty-Four-Hour Blood Pressure and Heart Rate Measurements. Blood pres-
sure and heart rate measurements started shortly after scheduled wake time
until scheduled wake time 24 h later: i.e., between 7:00 AM and 7:00 AM in
the circadian alignment protocol (wake and sleep period 5, and wake and
sleep period 7) and between 7:00 PM and 7:00 PM in the circadian mis-
alignment protocol (wake and sleep period 6, and wake and sleep period 8).
Measurements were obtained with a Spacelabs 90217 ambulatory blood
pressure monitor (Spacelabs Medical, Inc.), which has been validated
according to the Association for the Advancement of Medical Instrumen-
tation’s standards (70).
Urine and Blood Sampling. Twenty-four-hour urinary epinephrine and nor-
epinephrine levels were determined by collecting urine voids shortly after
scheduled wake time until shortly after scheduled wake time 24 h later: i.e.,
between ∼7:00 AM and 7:00 AM in the circadian alignment protocol (wake
period 5 and 6 and wake period 7 and 8) and between ∼7:00 PM and 7:00 PM
in the circadian misalignment protocol (wake period 6 and 7 and wake period
8 and 9). Urine voids were scheduled every 4 h during the wake episodes
and once after the 8-h sleep opportunities. Any extra voids were stored at
4 °C and pooled with the subsequent scheduled voids. See SI Methods
for details.
To assess levels of inflammatory markers, PAI-1 and tPA activity, blood
samples were collected every 4 hours between 11:53 PM and 7:53 PM in
the circadian alignment protocol (sleep period 4 and wake period 5, and
sleep period 6 and wake period 7) and every 4 hours between 11:53 AM and
7:53 AM in the circadian misalignment protocol (sleep period 5 and wake
period 6, and sleep period 7 and wake period 8). See SI Methods for details.
Heart Rate Variability. For assessment of heart rate variability, a three-lead
electrocardiogram was recorded on a Vitaport (TEMEC Instruments) between
10:40 PM and 10:35 PM in the circadian alignment protocol (sleep period 4
and wake period 5, and sleep period 6 and wake period 7) and 10:40 AM and
10:35 AM in the circadian misalignment protocol (sleep period 5 and wake

 period 6, and sleep period 7 and wake period 8). Participants underwent
7 min of voluntary paced breathing at 10:20 AM and 10:20 PM in the circadian
alignment protocol (wake period 5 and 7) and at 10:20 PM and 10:20 AM in
the circadian misalignment protocol (wake period 6 and 8). Heart rate var-
iability analyses were performed according to the standards of the Task Force
(71). See SI Methods for details.
Polysomnography and Actigraphy. Sleep was recorded by PSG during sleep
periods 1, 4, and 6 in the circadian alignment protocol and during sleep
periods 1, 5, and 7 in the circadian misalignment protocol, as detailed pre-
viously (35). We used actigraphy data to estimate sleep duration for sleep
periods in which PSG assessments did not occur (Actiwatch Spectrum; Philips-
Respironics). See SI Methods for details.
Statistics. Statistical tests were performed with linear mixed models, with
participant included as a random factor. We tested the effects of con-
dition (circadian misalignment vs. circadian alignment), time into the
behavioral cycle, and their individual and combined interaction with test
period (1 vs. 3) (Fig. 1) on blood pressure, heart rate, cardiac vagal
markers, epinephrine and norepinephrine excretion rates, and IL-6, CRP,
resistin, PAI-1, and tPA concentrations. We also tested the effect of
condition and its interaction with test period on the sleep opportunity-
associated dipping in blood pressure and heart rate (calculated as the
decrease from the wake period to the sleep opportunity as a percentage
of the wake period) and 24-h area under the curve—calculated using the
trapezoidal method—for epinephrine and norepinephrine excretion
rates. Within-participant correlations were performed as previously de-
scribed (72). Linear mixed models (participant included as a random
factor) were also used for mediation analyses (73). Where appropriate,
Bonferroni-adjusted multiple comparisons were performed. Where nec-
essary, analysis was performed on log-transformed data. Statistical sig-
nificance was accepted as P < 0.05. Data are presented as mean ± SEM,
unless otherwise indicated.
