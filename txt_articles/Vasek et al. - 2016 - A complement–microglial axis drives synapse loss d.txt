Abstract
Over 50% of patients who survive neuroinvasive infection with West Nile virus (WNV) exhibit 
chronic cognitive sequelae1,2. Although thousands of cases of WNV-mediated memory 
dysfunction accrue annually3, the mechanisms responsible for these impairments are unknown. 
The classical complement cascade, a key component of innate immune pathogen defence, 
mediates synaptic pruning by microglia during early postnatal development4,5. Here we show that 
viral infection of adult hippocampal neurons induces complement-mediated elimination of 
presynaptic terminals in a murine WNV neuroinvasive disease model. Inoculation of WNV-NS5-
E218A, a WNV with a mutant NS5(E218A) protein6,7 leads to survival rates and cognitive 
dysfunction that mirror human WNV neuroinvasive disease. WNV-NS5-E218A-recovered mice 
(recovery defined as survival after acute infection) display impaired spatial learning and 
persistence of phagocytic microglia without loss of hippocampal neurons or volume. Hippocampi 
from WNV-NS5-E218A-recovered mice with poor spatial learning show increased expression of 
genes that drive synaptic remodelling by microglia via complement. C1QA was upregulated and 
localized to microglia, infected neurons and presynaptic terminals during WNV neuroinvasive 
disease. Murine and human WNV neuroinvasive disease post-mortem samples exhibit loss of 
hippocampal CA3 presynaptic terminals, and murine studies revealed microglial engulfment of 
presynaptic terminals during acute infection and after recovery. Mice with fewer microglia (Il34−/− 
mice with a deficiency in IL-34 production) or deficiency in complement C3 or C3a receptor were 
protected from WNV-induced synaptic terminal loss. Our study provides a new murine model of 
WNV-induced spatial memory impairment, and identifies a potential mechanism underlying 
neurocognitive impairment in patients recovering from WNV neuroinvasive disease.
Studies in humans and rodents indicate that WNV targets neurons within the hippocampus8, 
which is essential for spatial and contextual memory formation9. Patients that survive WNV 
neuroinvasive disease often exhibit impaired visuospatial processing and memory1,10. In 
post-mortem samples of patients with WNV neuroinvasive disease and in rodent models 
with low survival rates (<50%), significant neuronal loss, inflammation, and microglial 
activation occur within infected brain regions11–14. However, the extent of viral burden and 
neuron loss may be much lower in individuals who survive WNV neuroinvasive disease and 
may vary between brain regions. In addition, host-pathogen interactions could explain the 
range of cognitive sequelae experienced by WNV neuroinvasive disease survivors1.
Mechanisms underlying cognitive impairments in patients recovering from West Nile 
neuroinvasive disease are unknown, mainly due to lack of murine recovery models. Current 
models that use virulent WNV strains yield either 100% death following intracranial WNV 
infection or 10–70% survival and variable CNS viral burdens following peripheral routes of 
infection15. To circumvent this in order to develop a model of recovery from WNV 
neuroinvasive disease, we used a strain of WNV with a point mutation in nonstructural

 protein 5 NS5(E218A), which lacks functional 2′-O methyltransferase that generates a 5′ 
cap on viral RNA to evade type I interferon-mediated restriction of viral translation6,16. 
While WNV-NS5-E218A replicates in permissive cells, 90% of 8-week-old mice survive 
intracranial inoculation (Extended Data Fig. 1a), with uniform viral brain burdens peaking 
between 6–8-days post-infection (dpi)7, followed by viral clearance at 15 dpi (Extended 
Data Fig. 1b, c). Intracranial infection with WNV-NS5-E218A induces neuroinflammation 
within 7 dpi, with numbers and phenotypes of infiltrating leukocytes similar to intracranial 
infection with virulent strain WNV-NY99 (Extended Data Fig. 1d), and consistent with data 
demonstrating early reversion of WNV-NS5-E218A to wild-type virus within the central 
nervous system7. WNV-NS5-E218A intracranial infection results in few apoptotic neurons 
(0.5–1.5%) at 7 dpi (Extended Data Fig. 1e), similar to 8-week-old mice after footpad 
infection with WNV-NY99 (ref. 12). Thus, WNV-NS5-E218A may be used to examine 
behavioural, cellular, and molecular mechanisms of recovery from WNV neuroinvasive 
disease.
The Barnes maze behavioural task was used to determine whether WNV-NS5-E218A-
recovered mice exhibit neurocognitive deficits17. At 46 dpi, WNV-infected mice exhibit 
slower learning, commit more errors (Fig. 1a) and require more time (Fig. 1b) before 
locating the target hole than mock-infected controls (Supplementary Videos 1 and 2). 
Studies performed in mice at 22 dpi showed similar effects (Fig. 1e and Extended Data Fig. 
1f). WNV-NS5-E218A-recovered animals improve over the 5 days of training, although they 
continue to make significantly more errors than controls on each day. Recovered animals do 
not exhibit impairments in motor activity or exploratory anxiety in an open-field behavioural 
assessment at 45 dpi (Fig. 1c, d) or 21 dpi (Extended Data Fig. 1g), indicating that 
impairments in Barnes maze solving are specific to spatial learning.
Caspase-3-dependent apoptosis of neurons occurs in animals that succumb to WNV 
neuroinvasive disease12. TUNEL and NeuN-staining did not detect ongoing apoptosis 
(Extended Data Fig. 2a) or loss of NeuN+ neurons within the circuitry of the entorhinal 
cortex and hippocampus that serve spatial learning (Extended Data Fig. 2b). Similarly, 
hippocampal and total brain volumes at 52 dpi do not differ between mock-infected and 
WNV-NS5-E218A-infected animals (Extended Data Fig. 2c), and GFAP staining within the 
hippocampus was unchanged (Extended Data Fig. 2d). However, microglial nodules were 
detected within the hippocampus of WNV-NS5-E218A-recovered animals at 7, 25, and 52 
dpi (Extended Data Fig. 3b). These nodules contained increased numbers of IBA1-positive 
cells with activated cell morphology (Fig. 1e). At 7 dpi, increased levels of CD68, a marker 
of microglial/macrophage lysosomal activation, were observed within both microglia and 
infiltrating macrophages of CX3CR1–GFP+/− mice (Fig. 1g, h), however macrophage 
infiltration was absent by 25 dpi (Extended Data Fig. 2f).
Whole-transcriptome microarray of hippocampi RNA from mock-infected versus WNV-
NS5-E218A-infected mice at 25 dpi enabled detection of differential expression of 1,364 
transcripts. Pathway analysis identified signatures associated with the generation and 
maintenance of synapses, activation of innate immune responses, and microglial proteins 
involved in sensing endogenous ligands and microbes18 (Supplementary Table 1). In the 
latter category, we identified genes associated with microglial-mediated phagocytosis

 (Cx3cr1 which encodes CX3CR1; Dap12 which encodes Dap12 (also known as Tyrobp); 
Fcer1g which encodes FcεR1G; Fcgr2b which encodes FcγR2; Rac2 which encodes Rac2 
and Was which encodes WAS) and the classical complement pathway (C1qa which encodes 
C1QA; C2 which encodes C2; C3 which encodes C3; C4b which encodes C4b and Serp1 
which encodes Serping1) (Fig. 2a), which were validated using quantitative PCR (qPCR) 
(Fig. 2b). C1q and C3 are required for retinogeniculate and cortical synaptic pruning during 
murine CNS development4,5,19. Although complement contributes to control of WNV 
dissemination following peripheral infection20, complement expression within the brain 
during WNV neuroinvasive disease has not been investigated.
To identify genetic signatures specific to spatial learning defects, we categorized WNV-NS5-
E218A-recovered mice into those that perform similar to mock-infected animals (good 
learners categorized as <8 errors) and those that exhibit severe learning deficits (poor 
learners categorized as >9.5 errors), on day 2 of Barnes maze testing (Figs 1e and 2c–e). A 
total of 747 genes were increased in the WNV poor learners, 45 genes altered in WNV good 
learners, and 572 genes altered in both groups compared to mock-infected littermates (Fig. 
2f) (Supplementary Tables 2 and 3). WNV-NS5-E218A-recovered animals with poor 
learning exhibited increased levels of CRRY (also known as Cr11), Dap12, FcγR2, Rac2, 
and C1QA and decreased levels of Dlg2, a synaptic scaffolding protein, and the 
metabotropic glutamate receptor, Grm5, compared with good learners and mock-infected 
animals (Fig. 2g). Grm5 is downregulated in mouse brain during acute WNV, Japanese 
encephalitis virus, and reovirus infections21. KEGG pathway analysis of upregulated genes 
in WNV poor memory compared to WNV good memory mice revealed top pathways of 
cytokine signalling, calcium signalling, and B-cell receptor signalling (Supplementary Table 
4), whereas top pathways of downregulated genes include long-term potentiation, axon 
guidance, and Wnt signalling (Supplementary Table 5).
Loss in neurons or persistence of virus could contribute to cognitive dysfunction. Evaluation 
of neuronal numbers throughout the hippocampus and entorhinal cortices of mock-infected 
and WNV-infected good and poor learners revealed no differences (Extended Data Fig. 2b). 
Analyses of WNV envelope protein positive and negative strand RNA from the hippocampi 
of WNV-NS5-E218A-recovered mice showed high levels of both strands at 7 dpi, which 
decreased by 25 and 52 dpi, with no differences in levels of either strand between good and 
poor learners at either time point (Extended Data Fig. 1h–j). These data suggest that 
persistence of replicating WNV-NS5-E218A does not contribute to alterations in learning.
Given the alterations in genes related to synaptic function, we quantified synaptic terminals 
within the hippocampus of WNV-NS5-E218A-infected mice. Numbers of colocalized 
presynaptic and postsynaptic puncta within the stratum lucidum of the hippocampal CA3 
(mossy fibre terminals) were decreased at 7 dpi in WNV-NS5-E218A-infected animals 
compared to mock-infected controls (Fig. 3a). The decrease in colocalization was traced to a 
40% reduction in number, but not size, of presynaptic terminals (Extended Data Fig. 3a), 
with no change in numbers of postsynaptic terminals (Fig. 3a). Altered expression of the 
presynaptic glutamatergic vesicular transporter, VGlut1 (also known as Slc17a7), in the 
hippocampus has been linked to cognitive impairment in rodents22. Evidence of 
hippocampal glutamatergic synapse loss was detectable at 25 dpi and WNV-NS5-E218A-

 recovered mice with poor spatial learning exhibited fewer VGlut1-positive synaptic puncta 
than WNV-NS5-E218A-infected good learners, which were fewer than in mock-infected 
controls (Fig. 3b). WNV-NY99 infection led to similar reductions in synaptic terminals 
(Extended Data Fig. 3b). Of note, mock-infected and WNV-NS5-E218A-recovered mice (all 
learners) display similar levels of phosphorylated neurofilament heavy chain (SMI-31) 
within hippocampal mossy fibre tracts (Extended Data Fig. 3c). These results indicate that 
axons are preserved despite elimination of synapses, suggesting that synapse elimination 
does not lead to neuronal death.
Acute post-mortem WNV neuroinvasive disease patient specimens similarly show reduced 
numbers of CA3 presynaptic terminals compared to age-matched patient controls (Fig. 3c 
and Supplementary Table 5). In 3 out of 5 WNV cases, WNV antigen was detected within 
the CA2/CA3 region, but absent from neighbouring regions (Supplementary Table 6 and 
Extended Data Fig. 4a). Hippocampal CA1 and entorhinal cortex in the human samples also 
displayed presynaptic terminal loss (Extended Data Fig. 4b, c). These data show that 
synaptic pathology is observed in areas without detectable viral antigen. Thus, WNV 
infection may alter synapse homeostasis both in affected and connected brain regions.
Given their phagocytic appearance in WNV-recovered mice, we wondered if microglia were 
driving synapse loss. Three-dimensional reconstructions of microglia from CX3CR1–GFP+/− 
WNV-NS5-E218A-infected mice (Fig. 3d) revealed synaptophysin-positive puncta within 
GFP+ cells (Supplementary Videos 3 and 4). Additionally, presynaptic terminals from mice 
with fewer and less proliferative microglia (Il34−/−)23 were not eliminated during WNV-
NS5-E218A acute infection (Fig. 3e). Colocalization of synaptophysin, lysosomal-
associated membrane protein 1 (LAMP1), and IBA1, revealed increased numbers of 
presynaptic terminals within the lysosomes of IBA1-positive cells, but not S100β+ astrocytes 
(Extended Data Fig. 3d), in the CA3 of WNV-NS5-E218A-infected mice at 7 and 25 dpi 
compared with mock-infected animals (Fig. 3f). Numbers of engulfed presynaptic terminals 
recover to baseline levels by 52 dpi, suggesting that presynaptic elimination eventually 
abates. Electron microscopy of the CA3 and molecular layer (Fig. 3g) during acute WNV 
neuroinvasive disease identified microglia enriched in phagosomes (Extended Data Fig. 3e) 
and with processes that surround synapses (Fig. 3g).
Macrophage-mediated phagocytosis in the periphery often requires antibody and 
complement deposition, however, no differences in the amount of endogenous mouse IgG 
coating VGlut1-positive or Homer1-positive, CA3 synaptic terminals at 7 and 25 dpi 
following WNV-NS5-E218A infection were observed compared to mock-infected controls 
(Extended Data Fig. 3f, g). Furthermore, μMT−/− mice, which lack mature B cells, eliminate 
synaptic terminals during acute WNV-NS5-E218A infection at similar levels as in wild-type 
mice (Extended Data Fig. 3h). Hippocampal upregulation of C1QA, the initiating factor of 
the classical complement cascade, was detected at 7, 25 and 52 dpi compared to mock-
infected controls (Fig. 4a). Hippocampal C1qa mRNA in conjunction with IBA1 expression 
was detected in mock-infected and WNV-NS5-E218A-infected mice at 7 dpi, the latter of 
which was increased (Fig. 4b). C1QA protein was detected in IBA1+ cellular processes 
adjacent to or surrounding neurons (Fig. 4b, c).

 C1QA also colocalized within WNV antigen-positive cells with neuronal morphology (Fig. 
4d) and with Map2-positive neurites (Fig. 4e). Increased levels of the complement C3 
cleavage product, C3d, also colocalized with VGlut1-positive terminals at 7 dpi (Fig. 4f). 
Levels of colocalization of C1QA with VGlut1-positive presynaptic terminals were 
significantly increased in WNV-NS5-E218A-recovered animals compared with mock-
infected controls at 7 and 25, but not 52 dpi (Fig. 4g). WNV-NS5-E218A-infected 
complement C3−/− and C3ar1−/−, but not CR1/2−/−or Itgam−/− (Itgam is also known as Cr3), 
mice showed no differences in synaptophysin-positive synaptic terminals compared to 
mock-infected controls (Fig. 4h). Presynaptic puncta within microglial (IBA1+) lysosomes 
were also decreased in WNV-NS5-E218A-infected complement C3−/− and C3ar1−/− 
compared to wild-type mice (Fig. 4i), indicating that WNV-mediated elimination of synaptic 
terminals requires C3 and C3aR.
Many pathogens and pathogen-associated molecular patterns induce complement activation 
within the central nervous system, including WNV24, HIV25, and amyloid plaques26. Our 
study suggests that complement C3 and C3aR mediate presynaptic terminal loss in the 
hippocampi of mice that exhibit spatial learning defects during recovery from West Nile 
neuroinvasive disease. Microglia and recognition of C3 cleavage products by complement 
receptor C3aR, which is expressed by both neurons and microglia27, are required for this 
process. Although astrocytes did not exhibit increased colocalization with synaptic 
terminals, we cannot completely rule out their contribution to this process, as their rates of 
lysosomal digestion differs from microglia28. Furthermore, alterations to NMDA receptor-
mediated long-term potentiation could also contribute to altered synapse homeostasis and 
memory as several genes in this pathway are differentially expressed in WNV-poor learners 
(Supplementary Table 4). It is unknown whether complement labelled and eliminated 
terminals are connected to WNV infected or healthy neurons. In the context of neurotropic 
viral infection, elimination of presynaptic terminals may prevent trans-synaptic viral spread 
or aberrant signalling of infected neurons. Further studies will determine if complement- and 
microglial-dependent synapse elimination prevents neuron-to-neuron spread of WNV and 
other neurotropic viruses.
METHODS
Animals
At the outset of all experiments, 8–10-week-old male and female mice were used. C57BL/6J 
and CD11b−/− (CR3−/−) mice were obtained from Jackson Laboratories. C3−/−,CR1/2−/− (in 
mice, CR1 and CR2 are splice variants both derived from the mouse Cr2 gene), and C3aR−/− 
mice (> 10 generations back-crossed to C57BL/6) were obtained from John Atkinson 
(Washington University), CX3CR1–GFP+/− mice (> 10 generations backcrossed to C57Bl/6) 
were obtained from Richard Ransohoff (Lerner Research Institute, Cleveland Clinic 
Foundation), μMT−/− mice (C57BL/6 background) were obtained from Michael Diamond 
(Washington University), and Il34−/− mice (C57BL/6 background) were obtained from 
Marco Colonna (Washington University). All mice were randomly assigned to control or 
experimental groups at the beginning of each experiment. All experimental protocols were

 performed in compliance with the Washington University School of Medicine Animal 
Studies Committee (protocol number 20140122).
Mouse models of WNV infection
The WNV strain 3000.0259 was isolated in New York and passaged once in C6/36 Aedes 
albopictus cells to generate an insect-cell-derived stock. Then 100 plaque-forming units 
(pfu) of WNV-NY99 were delivered in 50 μl to the footpad of anaesthetized mice. WNV-
NS5-E218A, which harbours a single point mutation in the 2′ O-methyl-transferase gene, 
was obtained from Michael Diamond (Washington University) and passaged in Vero cells as 
described previously6. Deeply anaesthetized mice were administered with 104 pfu of WNV-
NS5-E218A or 10 pfu of WNV-NY99 in 10 μl into the brain’s third ventricle via a guided 29 
gauge needle.
Stock titres of all viruses were determined by using BHK21 cells for viral plaque assay as 
previously described14.
Leukocyte isolation and flow cytometry
Cells were isolated from brains of wild-type mice at day 7 post-infection and stained with 
fluorescently conjugated antibodies to CD4, CD8, CD11b, and CD45 as previously 
described14. Data collection and analysis were performed with an LSRII flow cytometer 
using FlowJo software.
Behavioural testing
Test for anxiety and locomotor behavior—The open-field test was used to assess 
baseline differences in anxiety or locomotor behaviour, before Barnes maze experiments. A 
standard Open Field arena (54 × 54 cm, custom built) was used, consisting of a simple 
square box with a grid (6 squares per side) along the base. Animals were placed in the centre 
of the arena and allowed to explore for 5 min. The arena was decontaminated with 70% 
ethanol between each trial. Locomotor activity was assessed by counting the number of lines 
the animal crossed during the testing period, and anxiety was assessed by counting the 
number of times the animal crossed through the centre of the field. Behaviour was recorded 
using a camera (Canon PowerShot SD1100 IS), and a blinded experimenter scored the trial. 
Any mice that jumped out of the open-field maze were excluded from analyses.
Test for visual spatial memory
The Barnes maze was used to assess visual spatial memory. An elevated Barnes maze (91.4 
cm diameter, custom built) containing 19 empty holes and 1 target hole with a hidden escape 
chamber was used for testing (5 cm diameter holes were evenly spaced around the table, 
6.35 cm from the edge). Visual cues were placed around the room and remained in the same 
location during the entire testing period. Mice were tested on the Barnes maze over the 
course of 5 consecutive days. Each mouse received two trials per day, spaced exactly 30 min 
apart. For each trial, the mouse was placed in the centre of the maze in a covered start box 
for 10 s, and removal of the box signalled the start of a trial. Each mouse was given 3 min to 
explore the maze and find the target hole. Mice that did not enter the target hole within 3 
min were gently guided into the hole. After each trial, the mouse remained in the target hole

 for exactly 1 min, and then was returned to its home cage. The maze was decontaminated 
with 70% ethanol between each trial. The numbers of errors (nose pokes over non-target 
holes) and the latency to find the target hole (amount of time elapsed before nose poke over 
target hole) were measured. Behaviour was recorded using a camera (Canon Powershot 
SD1100IS), and a blinded experimenter scored the trials. Any mice which fell off the Barnes 
maze table during any trial were excluded from analyses. No randomization was required for 
these studies.
Immunohistochemistry
Following perfusion with ice-cold PBS and 4% PFA, brains were immersion-fixed overnight 
in 4% PFA, followed by cryoprotection in two exchanges of 30% sucrose for 72 h, then 
frozen in OCT (Fisher). 9μm-thick fixed-frozen coronal brain sections were washed with 
PBS and permeabilized with 0.1% Triton X-100 (Sigma-Aldrich), and nonspecific antibody 
was blocked with 5–10% normal goat serum (Santa Cruz Biotechnology) for 1 h at room 
temperature. Mouse on mouse kit (MOM basic kit, Vector) was used as per the 
manufacturer’s protocol when detecting synaptophysin to reduce endogenous mouse 
antibody staining. After block, slides were exposed to primary antibody or isotype matched 
IgG overnight at 4 °C, washed with 1 × PBS and incubated with secondary antibodies for 1 h 
at room temperature. Nuclei were counterstained with TO-PRO-3 (Invitrogen) and 
coverslips were applied with vectashield (Vector). Immunofluorescence was analysed using 
a Zeiss LSM 510 laser-scanning confocal microscope and accompanying software (Zeiss). 
Positive immunofluorescent signals were quantified by a blinded experimenter using the 
NIH Image analysis software, ImageJ.
TUNEL staining was performed using the TMR-red in situ cell death detection kit (Roche) 
as per manufacturer’s instructions. C1QA staining was performed as previously described29.

 MRI
Mice were intracardially perfused, first with ice-cold PBS and then with a mixture of 4% 
PFA and 10% Multihance (gadobenate dimeglumine, Bracco Diagnostics, Princeton, NJ). 
Heads were further fixed in 4% PFA for 24 h before being trimmed of extraneous tissue 
around the skull (to minimize the field of view). Heads were then placed in 1% Multihance 
in PBS until being imaged several days later. Ex vivo, whole-head MR imaging experiments 
were performed at 4.7 T using an Agilent/Varian (Santa Clara, CA) DirectDrive1 small-
animal scanner. Data were collected with a custom-made RF foil coil that fits tightly around 
the head using a 3D, T1-weighted gradient echo sequence with the following parameters: TR 
= 105 ms, TE = 6 ms, flip angle = 90°, isotropic resolution = (0.0625 mm)3, and scan time ~ 
11 h. Regions of interest were manually drawn for the whole brain and hippocampus in ITK-
SNAP (http://www.itksnap.org) from which volumes were calculated.
Collection and purification of hippocampal RNA
Mice were perfused with ice-cold PBS then hippocampi were dissected and snap-frozen in 
Tri-reagent (Ambion). Hippocampal tissue was then homogenized, and RNA purified as 
previously described30 using the RNA Ribopure kit (Ambion). RNA was precipitated with 
25 mM ammonium acetate in 100% ethanol at −80 °C overnight, resuspended in RNase-free 
H2O, and checked for purity. RNA was then treated with RNase-out and DNase I 
(invitrogen) as per the manufacturer’s protocol.
Microarray
Hippocampal RNA was isolated as described above and submitted to the Washington 
University Genome Technology Access Center. The total RNA quality and quantity were 
then determined by Agilent 2100 bioanalyzer (Agilent Technologies, Santa Clara, CA) and 
NanoDrop ND-1000 Spectrophotometer (Thermo Scientific NanoDrop, Wilmington, DE), 
according to manufacturer’s recommendations, respectively. A total of 400 ng of RNA 
transcripts from each sample were amplified by T7 linear amplification with the 
MessageAmp TotalPrep Amplification kit (Life Technologies-Ambion, Austin, TX). Then 
1.5 μg of each amplified and biotinylated RNA (aRNA) sample was hybridized onto 
Illumina MouseWG-6 v2 expression beadchips, followed by cy3 steptavidin-based staining, 
washing, and scanning, according to Illumina standard protocol. The iScan scanner-created 
image data were loaded into Illumina GenomeStudio (v2011) for generation of expression 
values and data normalizations. Only those probes that were detected at P < 0.05 in at least 
one of the samples were used in downstream statistical analysis. Background subtracted and 
quantile normalized data were used in statistical analysis for identification of differentially 
expressed genes with one-way ANOVA test using Partek Genomics Suite (v6.6, St. Louis, 
MO). All original P values in the ANOVA analysis were adjusted by q-value based multiple 
test correction31. KEGG pathway analysis was performed using DAVID bioinformatics 
database functional annotation tool v.6.7 (ref. 32). Microarray data has been deposited in the 
Gene Expression Omnibus (accession number GSE72139)

 Real-time quantitative RT-PCR
cDNA was synthesized using random hexamers, oligodT15, and MultiScribe reverse 
transcriptase (Applied Biosystems). A single reverse transcription master mix was used to 
reverse transcribe all samples to minimize differences in reverse transcription efficiency. The 
following conditions were used for reverse transcription reactions: 25 °C for 10 min, 48 °C 
for 30 min, and 95 °C for 5 min.
For all primer sets except for the strand-specific WNV PCR reaction (detailed below), PCR 
reactions were prepared using Power SYBR Green PCR mastermix and calculated copies 
were normalized against copies of the housekeeping gene, Gapdh.
Primers are listed in Supplementary Table 6.
WNV strand specific real-time RT-PCR
Two-step strand specific RT-PCR was performed using GVA and T7 tagged primers during 
cDNA synthesis as a modification to a procedure previously described33. First, cDNA was 
synthesized using the High-Capacity cDNA Reverse Transcription Kit (Applied Biosystems) 
per the manufacturer’s instruction, with the addition of 1 pmol of the positive-strand primer 
GVA_TxsspE1229 and 1 pmol of the negative strand primer T7_TxsspE1160 to the 10 μl 
reaction mixture. Strand specific cDNA was then amplified in a qPCR reaction using 
primers directed against the strand specific WNV sequence and the tag sequence. Each 12.5 
μl qPCR reaction mixture contained 6.25 μl TaqMan Gene Expression Master mix, 10 pmol 
tag primer (positive mix: GVA, negative mix: T7), 10 pmol strand specific primer (positive 
mix: TXsspE1160, negative mix: TXsspE1229), 2.5 pmol strand specific probe 
(WNVsspEProbe) and 50 ng strand specific cDNA. Thermal cycling was performed using 
Applied Biosystems ViiA 7 Real-Time PCR system with a 384-well block. Copies were 
calculated based on a standard curve generated from purified PCR product from positive 
strand or negative strand reactions, and normalized to amount of Gapdh in each sample.
For the following sequences, the bold sequence represents the tag sequence, while the 
underlined sequence represents the strand specific sequence: GVA_TxsspE1229: 5′-

Quantification of synaptic terminals
ImageJ was used to threshold single-plane confocal images, draw a region of interest 
encompassing the CA3 mossy fibres, and to quantify the number of synaptophysin or 
VGlut1+ puncta containing between 0.5 and 25 square μm2 in area. For each mouse, at least 
12 images at 63 × magnification were counted, which were derived from at least 4 fixed-
frozen coronal sections spaced 50 μM apart.

 Quantification of synaptic terminal engulfment by IBA1+ cells
ImageJ was used to threshold single-plane confocal images, draw a region of interest 
encompassing each IBA1+ cell within the hippocampal CA3, and to quantify the number of 
synaptophysin+, Lamp1+, IBA1+ puncta between 0.2 and 25 μm2 in area within each IBA1+ 
cell. For each mouse, at least 8 images at 63 × magnification were counted, which were 
derived from at least 4 fixed-frozen coronal sections spaced 50 μM apart.
Electron microscopy
Mice were perfused with 4% PFA, the brain was removed, and immersion fixed for 24 h at 
room temperature. Tissue was washed in PBS, and 100 μm sections were cut from regions of 
interest using a vibratome. Sections were incubated in 0.5% gelatin, 5% horse serum, and 
0.01% saponin in PBS for 5 h on a rotator at room temperature. Sections were then 
incubated for 48 h at 4 °C on a rotator with rabbit anti-IBA1 (1:600; Wako). After washing 
in dPBS, sections were incubated overnight at 4 °C on rotator with donkey anti-rabbit 
biotinylated secondary antibody, (1:500; Rockland) in 0.5% gelatin and 5% horse serum in 
dPBS. Sections were again washed, and then incubated with streptavidin-HRP (1:1000; 
Rockland, S000-03) for 3 h at room temperature, followed by another wash. HRP was 
visualized using the DAB Substrate Kit (Cell Marque,957D) for 5 min, washed and then 
fixed with 2% PFA, 2.5% glutaraldehyde, in PBS for 30 min, followed by a wash in PBS. 
Sections were post-fixed in 1% osmium tetroxide in PBS for 30 min at room temperature, 
washed in PBS, and then dehydrated in sequential concentrations of ethanol for 30 min each. 
Sections were then infiltrated with 1:1 Spurr’s resin and 100% ethanol overnight on a 
rotator, followed by two changes in pure Spurr’s resin over 24 h. Sections were embedded 
with Aclar film (EMS, 50425), and polymerized at 60 °C for 48 h. The hippocampus was 
trimmed from the polymerized section, glued to a previously prepared block of Spurr’s 
resin, and allowed to cure for at least 24 h. Using a Diatome ultra 45° diamond knife and a 
LEICA Ultracut UC7, blocks were sectioned at 500 nm to confirm location of the tissue and 
the positivity of antibodies. Once confirmed, 90 nm sections were cut and picked up onto 
200 hex mesh, formvar-carbon coated copper grids (Ted Pella, 01800-F). Images were 
digitally captured using a JEOL 1200 EX II transmission electron microscope with AMT 
digital camera.
Three-dimensional reconstruction of confocal z-stack images
Confocal z-stack images taken with a Zeiss LSM 510 META microscope at 63 × 
magnification, consisting of at least 10 images were transformed into 3D reconstruction 
videos using Volocity 3D image analysis software (PerkinElmer).
Super-resolution microscopy of presynaptic terminals
Sections were imaged using a Zeiss ELYRA PS1 microscope. 0.101 μm optical slices of the 
CA3 region of the hippocampus were captured and images subsequently processed using 
Zeiss SIM algorithms to generate structured illumination images. Zeiss Zen software was 
used to generate orthogonal viewpoints showing colocalization of VGlut1 and C1q in the x, 
y and z planes.

 Human tissue
Human autopsy hippocampal tissue embedded in paraffin was obtained from St. Louis 
University Medical Center (St. Louis, MO) and Presbyterian / St. Luke’s Medical Center 
(Denver, CO). Sections were first deparaffinized and then boiled in 10 mM sodium citrate 
buffer for 30 min, for antigen retrieval before staining with anti-synaptophysin antibody 
(DAKO, 1:50).
In situ hybridization
Fluorescent in situ hybridization was performed on 9 μm coronal brain sections that were 
4% PFA-fixed and frozen. C1QA and NSE were used as double mRNA staining and IBA1 
as immune-staining. C1qA and NSE anti-sense RNA was made and labelled with cyanine 
and fluorescein, respectively, using an RNA labelling kit (Roche). C1QA was amplified by 
PCR from pCMV SPORT6 C1qA plasmid (Openbiosystem MMM1013-63584), using 
forward 5′-GGCATCCGGACTGGTATCCGAGG-3′ and reverse 5′-
GGTAAATGCGACCCTTTGCGGGG-3′ primers, which was digested with SalI and 
transcribed with T7 promoter. The RNA probes were incubated overnight at 64 °C, and then 
detected with antibodies against fluorescein and cyanine (Roche). The staining reaction was 
then amplified with a TSA staining kit (PerkinElmer). A rabbit anti-IBA1 (Wako) antibody 
was used to label macrophages and microglia and detected with a donkey anti-rabbit 647 
antibody (Life technologies). Stained sections were then imaged and analysed on a Zeiss 
AX10 fluorescent microscope. Statistical analysis. To determine mouse group sizes for 
virological or immunological studies, power analysis was performed using the following 
values: probability of type I error = 0.05, power = 80%, fivefold hypothetical difference in 
mean, and population variance of 25-fold (virological studies) or 12-fold (immunological 
studies). Results from Barnes maze spatial learning and memory studies were compared by 
repeated measures two-way ANOVA. Microarray data was analysed by one-way ANOVA 
and fold change greater than 1.5, false discovery rate q < 0.05 to correct for multiple 
hypotheses for mock vs WNV-all comparison, P < 0.05 for WNV good learners vs WNV 
poor learners. Variance between groups was equivalent except for cases noted within figure 
legends and the comparison for number of presynaptic terminals in Fig. 3 a and the 
comparisons at 7 and 25 dpi in Fig. 3f, in which a Welch’s correction on the two-tailed t-test 
was used to correct for unequal variance. All other experiments were compared by Student’s 
two-tailed t-test, with *P < 0.05 considered significant. Power calculations using results 
observed in a pilot study in which WNV-recovered mice exhibit a two-fold increase in peak 
errors compared with mock-infected animals indicate that at least 15 recovered mice per 
group will be required to obtain statistical significance (P < 0.05) on Barnes maze testing.
