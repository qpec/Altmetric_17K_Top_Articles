SUMMARY
Circadian rhythms, metabolism, and nutrition are
intimately linked [1, 2], although effects of meal
timing on the human circadian system are poorly
understood. We investigated the effect of a 5-hr
delay in meals on markers of the human master
clock and multiple peripheral circadian rhythms.
Ten healthy young men undertook a 13-day labora-
tory protocol. Three meals (breakfast, lunch, dinner)
were given at 5-hr intervals, beginning either 0.5
(early) or 5.5 (late) hr after wake. Participants were
acclimated to early meals and then switched to
late meals for 6 days. After each meal schedule,
participants’ circadian rhythms were measured in
a 37-hr constant routine that removes sleep and
environmental rhythms while replacing meals with
hourly isocaloric snacks. Meal timing did not alter
actigraphic
sleep
parameters
before
circadian
rhythm measurement. In constant routines, meal
timing did not affect rhythms of subjective hunger
and sleepiness, master clock markers (plasma
melatonin and cortisol), plasma triglycerides, or
clock gene expression in whole blood. Following
late
meals,
however,
plasma
glucose
rhythms
were delayed by 5.69 ± 1.29 hr (p < 0.001), and
average
glucose
concentration
decreased
by
0.27 ± 0.05 mM (p < 0.001). In adipose tissue,
PER2 mRNA rhythms were delayed by 0.97 ±
0.29 hr (p < 0.01), indicating that human molecular
clocks may be regulated by feeding time and
could underpin plasma glucose changes. Timed
meals therefore play a role in synchronizing periph-
eral circadian rhythms in humans and may have
particular relevance for patients with circadian
rhythm disorders, shift workers, and transmeridian
travelers.
RESULTS
No Change in Rhythms of SCN Clock-Driven Hormones,
Markers of Sleep, or Subjective Appetite
Mammalian circadian rhythms are driven by a master clock,
within the suprachiasmatic nuclei (SCN) of the hypothalamus,
and peripheral clocks located throughout the body [3]. For
the circadian system to function optimally, individual clocks
must be correctly synchronized to one another and to the
external environment. Abnormal circadian rhythms or defects
in synchronization pathways can result in circadian misalign-
ment or desynchrony, which are associated with poor health
and metabolic disorders [4, 5]. In most individuals, the SCN
clock is set to solar time by photic input pathways originating
in the retina [6]; the SCN then synchronize peripheral clocks
through neuronal pathways, hormone rhythms, core body
temperature, and behaviors such as the cycle of feeding and
fasting [3]. Photic cues are of primary importance for resetting
human rhythms [7]. Regularly timed non-photic cues, however,
can regulate rhythms in non-human species; for example, tem-
poral restriction of food availability resets the phase of rodent
peripheral clocks [8, 9], with more subtle effects on the rodent
SCN [10]. Human studies have revealed that post-prandial re-
sponses are dependent on meal timing [11–14], but little is
known of the ability of meals per se to alter the timing of hu-
man circadian rhythms.
We investigated a 5-hr delay in three isocaloric daily meals
(breakfast, lunch, and dinner) with identical macronutrient con-
tent on circadian rhythms using a 13-day laboratory protocol
(Figure 1A). The overarching hypothesis was that the delay in
meal timing delays peripheral rhythms, but not markers of the
SCN clock. Phase changes were indirectly assessed by meal
3 time-of-day interactions in ANOVA analysis of grouped data
and directly assessed by cosinor analysis of individual partici-
pant data (see STAR Methods).
We first measured the effect of meal time on plasma melatonin
and cortisol rhythms, which are well-validated markers of the
SCN clock. No significant changes were found in the temporal
profiles of either hormone (Figures 1B and 1C). Next, in each in-
dividual, melatonin phase was measured using the dim light
melatonin onset (DLMO), and cortisol acrophase was calculated
using cosinor analysis. Delayed meals had no significant effect
on either DLMO or cortisol phase (DLMO: t(9) = 0.94, p = 0.372;
cortisol: t(9) = 0.96, p = 0.182; paired t test).
As sleep disruption is known to modulate metabolic physi-
ology [15], we assessed subjective sleepiness throughout each
constant routine using the Karolinska Sleepiness Scale (KSS).
The expected temporal variation was observed, but there was
no significant effect of meal timing (Figure S1). Furthermore,
we were unable to detect any effects of meal timing on objective
markers of sleep assessed by actigraphy (Figure S1). We as-
sessed the influence of meal time on subjective appetite using
a visual analog scale (VAS) but again found no significant effect
(Figure S2).

 Plasma Glucose, but Not Insulin or Triglyceride,
Rhythms Are Affected by Meal Time
Plasma glucose concentration exhibited significant effects
of time of day, meals, and meal 3 time-of-day interaction (Fig-
ure 2A). In order to quantify the effect of timed meals on glucose
rhythm phase, we used cosinor analysis. The glucose acrophase
occurred 1.31 ± 0.82 hr before DLMO following early meals but
4.38 ± 0.83 hr after DLMO following late meals. The 5-hr change
in meal time delayed the relative phase of glucose rhythms by
5.69 ± 1.29 hr (Figure 2D).
The possible contribution of insulin to the delayed glucose
rhythms was also investigated. Despite a significant effect of
time of day, there was no significant effect of meals or meal 3
time-of-day interaction on plasma insulin concentration (Fig-
ure 2B). Cosinor analysis estimated an insulin acrophase
7.99 ± 1.99 hr after DLMO following early meals and 11.36 ±
0.89 hr after DLMO following late meals (Figure 2E).
There was a significant effect of time of day, but no significant
effect of meals or meal 3 time-of-day interaction on plasma tri-
glyceride concentration (Figure 2C). Cosinor analysis estimated
a triglyceride acrophase 6.59 ± 0.62 hr after DLMO following
early meals and 7.38 ± 0.30 hr after DLMO following late meals
(Figure 2F).
Differential Response of Clock Gene Rhythms in White
Adipose Tissue and Blood
To test the hypothesis that delayed meals delay molecular circa-
dian rhythms in peripheral tissues, we measured clock gene
transcripts in serial biopsies of white adipose tissue (WAT) using
a refinement of our previously published protocol [16, 17]. Gene

(A) In order to maximize circadian entrainment prior to beginning the study protocol, participants maintained a self-selected pre-laboratory light-dark and sleep-
wake pattern based on their habitual routine for 10 days. During the last week of the pre-laboratory period they ate breakfast (B) 30 min after wake, lunch (L) 5.5 hr
after wake, and dinner (D) 10.5 hr after wake. Participants then entered the laboratory on day 0. During days 0–3, participants remained on their self-selected
sleep-wake cycle. They slept in individual bedrooms in darkness (0 lux; black bars) and were awake in bright room light (�500 lux in direction of gaze) during the
day. Waking time was spent in communal areas (white bars) and in individual rooms (dotted bars). Isocaloric meals (B, L, D) were given 0.5, 5.5, and 10.5 hr after
waking up, matching the week of pre-laboratory meal timing. On day 4, participants began a 37-hr constant routine in individual rooms (<8 lux; gray bars).
Participants had a standard night’s sleep on day 5, before 6 more days of the sleep-wake and light-dark cycles (days 6–11). Conditions were equal to days 1–3
except for a 5-hr delay in all meal times. A second constant routine then commenced on day 12. Immediately before and after each constant routine, participants
were kept in a constant routine-like environment but allowed to move within their rooms (hatched bars).

repeated-measures ANOVA revealed a significant effect of time (melatonin: F(31, 279) = 19.00, p < 0.001; cortisol: F(31, 279) = 20.31, p < 0.001), but no significant
effect of meals (melatonin: F(1, 9) = 2.97, p = 0.119; cortisol: F(1, 9) = 2.27, p = 0.166) or meal 3 time interaction (melatonin: F(31, 279) = 0.13, p = 0.124; cortisol:
F(31, 279) = 1.39, p = 0.090). Data are mean ± SEM, n = 10. Statistical significance is defined as p < 0.01 (following Bonferroni correction for analysis of a total of five
rhythmic plasma markers).

 expression was measured in the seven participants from whom
we were able to obtain five biopsies, one every 6 hr, in both
constant routines. Data were obtained by RT-PCR for three
canonical clock genes and Z scored prior to analysis (Figures
3A–3C). There was a significant effect of time of day, but no
overall effect of meals on all three genes. There was a significant
meal 3 time-of-day interaction for PER2, but not for PER3 or
BMAL1. Cosinor analysis also revealed a significant effect of
meal timing on PER2 phase, but not on the phase of PER3 or
BMAL1 (Figures 3D–3F).
We next studied clock gene rhythmicity in whole blood sam-
ples. Consistent with previously published constant routine
data [18], we found weak rhythms in BMAL1 (Figure S3A) and
robust rhythms in PER3 gene expression (Figure S3B). However,
no significant effect of delayed meals on either rhythm was
observed.
Reduced Glucose Concentration Following Late Meals
Two-way repeated-measures ANOVA analysis of the time series
data indicated a significant decrease in glucose concentration
in the constant routine following late meals (Figure 2A). To inves-
tigate this in more detail, we compared each participant’s mean
glucose concentration in the two constant routines. There was a
significant decrease in the mean glucose concentration following
late meals (Figure 4A), with all ten of the participants exhibiting
lower plasma glucose after late meals. There was, however, no
significant decrease in the mean concentration of plasma insulin
(Figure 4B) or triglyceride (Figure 4C) following late meals. We
next compared the peak and trough values for each partici-
pant in each constant routine to determine whether the lower
glucose concentration was due to a reduced peak, trough, or
both (Figure 4D). There was an overall effect of meals and a sig-
nificant difference between peak and trough values. There was

 no significant interaction between the two factors, however, indi-
cating a similar lowering of both peak and trough plasma glucose
following the late meals.
DISCUSSION
This report demonstrates that meal timing exerts a variable influ-
ence over human physiological rhythms, with notable changes
occurring in aspects of glucose homeostasis. A 5-hr delay in
meal times induced a comparable delay in the phase of circadian
plasma glucose rhythms, as assessed under constant routine
conditions. These altered glucose rhythms were accompanied
by a 1-hr delay in the phase of WAT PER2 rhythms, but no
change in markers of the SCN clock (melatonin, cortisol),
rhythms of plasma insulin and triglyceride, or clock gene rhythms
in whole blood. We also observed a reduction in plasma glucose
concentration during the constant routine following late meals.
To limit our intervention to meal timing, participants main-
tained identical light-dark and sleep-wake schedules on days
when timed meals were given. Sample collection then occurred
in constant routine conditions after both early and late meals.
Constant routines remove environmental fluctuations and sleep
and replace meals with equally spaced isocaloric snacks [19];
the rhythms obtained are thus the product of endogenous
circadian processes and not the result of acute post-prandial
responses. Subjective sleepiness and hunger exhibited the ex-
pected temporal patterns. Sleepiness increased over the course
of each constant routine, due to continuous wakefulness, and
was highest during the subjective night. Self-reported hunger
scores dipped in the early subjective morning, as observed by
others [20, 21]. Meal timing had no effect on these subjective
sleep and appetite markers, or actigraphic sleep parameters re-
corded prior to each constant routine, indicating that responses
to a shift in meal times are unlikely to be driven by changes in
sleep propensity or appetite.
Circadian regulation of plasma glucose and triglyceride con-
centration in humans has been reported by others using con-
stant routine [12, 13, 22] and forced desynchrony [14] protocols.

 In addition, one study has reported minor (�1 hr) phase shifts of
human temperature and heart rate rhythms following morning or
evening carbohydrate-rich meals, but with no effect on mela-
tonin timing [23]. Very little research has addressed how tempo-
ral aspects of feeding regulate the circadian system of humans,
however. The altered glucose rhythms in our study did not coin-
cide with changes in plasma insulin rhythms and could thus be
driven by altered rhythms of insulin sensitivity and/or glucose
release from storage tissues. We observed no change in plasma
triglyceride rhythm. Meal timing therefore appears to exert
greater control over glucose homeostasis than lipid metabolism
and can dissociate the temporal regulation of these key physio-
logical processes.
We also investigated the effect of meal timing on markers of
both central and peripheral circadian clocks. On the basis of pre-
vious animal and human experiments, we hypothesized that
meal time would not alter the phase of melatonin and cortisol
rhythms, reliable markers of the SCN clock. Clock gene rhythms
in the SCN of rodents permitted ad libitum quantities of food do
not synchronize to meal time [8, 9]. Furthermore, melatonin and
cortisol rhythms in totally blind humans do not readily entrain to
ad libitum non-photic cues [24]. Our melatonin and cortisol data
demonstrated no differences after early compared to late meals.
This suggests that the observed changes in rhythms of meta-
bolic parameters are SCN independent, presumably occurring
via effects on peripheral clocks.
Data from animal studies indicate that circadian clocks in
multiple peripheral tissues contribute to glucose homeostasis
[25–30]. We therefore tested the hypothesis that late meals delay
the phase of human peripheral clocks. We and others have

late meals (5.45 ± 0.11 mmol/L) compared to early meals (5.72 ± 0.11 mmol/L, t(9) = 5.22, p < 0.001, paired t test). Following Bonferroni correction of the critical
p value, there was no significant decrease in the mean concentration of plasma insulin following late meals (208.2 ± 30.46 versus 192.6 ± 26.75 pmol/L, early
versus late, respectively; t(9) = 2.27, p = 0.049, paired t test). There was no significant difference in mean triglyceride concentration (1.22 ± 0.12 versus 1.21 ±

ference between peak and trough values (F(1, 9) = 177.6, p < 0.001), but no significant interaction between the two factors (F(1, 9) = 0.01, p = 0.914). ***p < 0.001

 previously demonstrated robust gene expression rhythms in se-
rial WAT biopsies and blood samples [16, 18, 31, 32]. Here we
observed a significant 1-hr delay in WAT PER2 expression.
Although this change is smaller than the phase delay of plasma
glucose rhythms, it nonetheless indicates for the first time
that feeding patterns may be capable of synchronizing human
peripheral clocks. Based on the differential resynchronization
rate of murine clocks to food [8, 9], we predict that the effect
of meal time on clocks in other peripheral tissues involved in
glucose homeostasis (e.g., liver, pancreas) would be larger
than in WAT. Indeed, tissue-specific responsiveness of periph-
eral tissue clocks is demonstrated by the lack of shift in PER3
rhythms in our blood samples.
Mean concentration of plasma glucose was 0.27 mM (4.7%)
lower following late meals. The reduction of both peak and
trough concentrations implies lower plasma glucose across the
circadian cycle, with no change in rhythm amplitude. The cause
of this change is unknown, but may involve the uncoupling of
clocks in tissues that regulate glucose metabolism. Alternatively,
experimental design may have resulted in an order effect on
glucose, but not triglyceride, concentration. Order effects are
extremely unlikely to contribute to the reported phase delays,
however, as metabolite and gene expression data were analyzed
relative to each individual’s endogenous melatonin phase. It is
currently unclear how plasma glucose concentrations in a con-
stant routine, where participants receive small hourly snacks,
relate to the elevated post-prandial glucose excursion that oc-
curs in the biological evening and night, compared to the early
morning [12, 13]. These questions will be the focus of future
research.
Limitations of the current study include the restricted partici-
pant demographics (all young men) and the fact that it is impos-
sible to serially biopsy most human tissues closely associated
with glucose homeostasis. The use of tightly controlled demo-
graphics is standard for this type of human laboratory trial.
However, now that we have identified physiological responses
in young male volunteers, it will be possible to target future
studies to other groups. Serial sampling of human tissues has
obvious practical considerations, limiting the number of study
participants and the sampling resolution. Use of our WAT biopsy
protocol has nonetheless enabled us to uncover novel effects of
meal timing on gene expression rhythms in a metabolically
important human tissue.
Our study reveals clear effects of meal timing on glucose ho-
meostasis in a controlled laboratory setting. It is possible that
timed meals could have a different effect on individuals not as
tightly entrained as our study participants. Nonetheless, the im-
plications of this novel finding include insight into the effects of
eating behavior on human physiology, e.g., in patients with night
eating disorder. The most wide-ranging impact, however, could
be an addition to the existing light and sleep strategies for treat-
ing people with circadian desynchrony, which occurs following
shift work and transmeridian flight. Prolonged desynchrony
and shift work have been associated with obesity and cardiome-
tabolic disease, so measures to appropriately synchronize the
circadian system could benefit long-term health in many people.
Timed interventions such as light exposure, or administration of
oral agents including melatonin and caffeine, regulate the phase
of human SCN-driven hormonal rhythms [33–37]. Oral adminis-
tration of glucocorticoid can also phase shift clock gene rhythms
in human blood mononuclear cells [38]. We now provide a non-
pharmacological means by which some peripheral metabolic
rhythms can be phase shifted in humans. Future work will need
to examine the effects of timed meal patterns in simulated and
real-life models of human jet lag and shift work. Animal studies
[39] indicate this could be a very fruitful area of research.

EXPERIMENTAL MODEL AND SUBJECT DETAILS
Ten male participants, 18-30 years old, were recruited to meet the following inclusion criteria: 20 R BMI % 30 kg/m2 and fat mass R
14%, Horne-O
¨ stberg (HO
¨ ) questionnaire [40] 30 > HO
¨ < 70, completed Munich Chronotype Questionnaire (MCTQ) [41], Pittsburgh
Sleep Quality Index (PSQI) [42] % 5, Beck Depression Inventory (BDI) [43, 44] % 9 and Epworth Sleepiness Scale (ESS) [45, 46] % 9.
The recruited participants had average age and BMI of 22.9 ± 1.27 and 23.1 ± 0.80 (mean ± SEM), respectively. Participants
had regular sleep patterns on 5 or more nights per week (bed time 22:00-01:00 hr, wake up time 06:00-09:00 h), a sleep duration
of 7-9 hr and habitual caffeine intake % 300 mg/day. Absence of cotinine and drugs of abuse was checked by a urine test, and
absence of alcohol by a breath test. All participants were free of medical conditions and/or medication known to affect study param-
eters. They also had normal blood hematology, biochemistry and serology. All study procedures received a favorable ethical opinion
from The University of Surrey Ethics Committee. The study and data processing were carried out in accordance with the Helsinki
Declaration of 1975, as revised in 2008, and the UK Data Protection Act (1998). All participants gave written informed consent
after the nature and possible consequences of the study were explained.
METHOD DETAILS
Pre-laboratory study period
Participants were required to keep a self-selected regular 8 hr sleep period for 10 days prior to the start of the laboratory protocol.
Self-selected sleep periods were based on habitual sleep patterns, as reported in PSQI and MCTQ data. Participants were permitted
a nap during a 4 hr afternoon window, asked to obtain morning natural light exposure, and required to confirm behavior using voice-
mail, sleep diaries and light-sensitive actiwatches, as described previously [47]. For 1 week prior to the study, participants were
asked to complete a food diary, consume % 100 mg caffeine in the first 3 hr after waking, and % 2 drinks of alcohol per day. Break-
fast, lunch and dinner were consumed 0.5, 5.5 and 10.5 hr after waking. For 72 hr prior to the laboratory session, food was provided
for the participants to eat at home and eaten within the same time windows as the preceding 4 days. Participants were also asked to
refrain from heavy exercise, alcohol and caffeine over these final 72 hr.
Laboratory study design
All participants undertook a 13-day laboratory protocol (Figure 1). Throughout the laboratory protocol, each participant wore an
ActiwatchL (Cambridge Neurotechnology Ltd) on their non-dominant wrist in order to provide an objective analysis of sleep markers
during the sleep opportunities. Upon admission, continuing eligibility was assessed and repeat tests performed for breath alcohol,
cotinine and drugs of abuse. During days 0-3 participants remained on their self-selected sleep-wake cycle and received meals 0.5,

 5.5 and 10.5 hr after waking up. Breakfast, lunch and dinner were identical in energy and macronutrient content, with energy require-
ments determined using the Schofield equation. The macronutrient content of the meals was: 55% carbohydrate, of which 15% was
sugars; 15% protein; and 30% fat, of which 11% was saturated. Participants slept in individual bedrooms. During the day partici-
pants were free to move around in bright room light (�500 lux in direction of gaze), but were not permitted to undergo any excessive
exercise and were predominantly seated. Meals were eaten in the individual bedrooms to eliminate the impact of the smell and sight
of other participants’ food. On day 4, participants were cannulated after waking and remained in dim light until they began a 37 hr
constant routine (CR1) in individual rooms. During the constant routine, participants were kept awake in a semi-recumbent posture
in dim light (< 8 lux in the direction of gaze) and received hourly isocaloric sandwiches and milkshakes. Individual energy requirements
during the constant routine were again determined using the Schofield equation. Participants were allowed to consume % 100 mL
water with each hourly meal except in the 10 min preceding a sample. A modified version of the Karolinska Sleepiness Scale [48, 49]
followed by visual analog appetite scales [50] were completed before each meal. After the constant routine, participants had a stan-
dard night’s sleep and underwent 6 more days of the sleep/wake light/dark cycle (day 6-11). Conditions were equal to days 1-3
except for a 5 hr delay in all meal times. A second 37 hr constant routine (CR2) then commenced on the morning of day 12, following
the same procedure as for the earlier constant routine.
Biopsy and blood sample collection
To allow for a ‘wash out’ of any pre-constant routine effects of sleep, posture and food, sampling started at least 5.5 hr after the start
of the constant routine. Using a modified version of our previous method [16], five serial gluteal subcutaneous white adipose tissue
(WAT) biopsies were collected every 6 hr into cryotubes, frozen within 5 min in liquid nitrogen and stored in �80�C. Blood samples
were taken via a cannula over a 32 hr period. Blood was collected hourly into lithium heparin vacutainers for analysis of melatonin and
cortisol, as well as into di-potassium EDTA vacutainers for measurement of glucose, lipids and additional hormones. Immediately
upon sample collection, vacutainers were inverted 10 times and cooled until centrifugation (1620 g at 4�C for 10 min, within
30 min of collection). The plasma fraction was transferred to microcentrifuge tubes, within 50 min of collection, and stored
at �20�C. Blood samples for leukocyte clock gene expression were taken 2-hourly in PAXgene Blood RNA tubes (PreAnalytiX),
as previously described [18].
Actigraphy measurements
Data from actiwatches were down-loaded and analyzed using CNT Sleep Analysis software (Cambridge Neurotechnology Ltd,
Papworth Everard UK). Specific parameters assessed were: sleep duration, sleep efficiency, sleep latency and fragmentation index.
For each participant, the average of each parameter was calculated for the 3 nights before each constant routine to represent that
individual’s sleep when experiencing early and late meal times. Data from one of the ten participants were excluded due to abnormal
baseline values reported by the actiwatch.
Plasma hormone and metabolite measurements
Glucose and triglycerides were measured by enzymatic colorimetric detection in the Ilab (Instrumentation Laboratory, Warrington,
UK) and hormones (melatonin, cortisol and insulin) were measured as described elsewhere [47, 51, 52]. Inter-assay CVs were <
10% for glucose and TAG; between 8.1 and 12.8% for melatonin; between 7.5 and 11.0% for cortisol; and < 20% for insulin.
Gene expression measurements
RNA was extracted from approximately 100 mg adipose tissue using the RNeasy mini kit (QIAGEN Ltd, Crawley, UK) according to the
manufacturer’s instructions. Leukocyte total RNA was extracted as previously described [18]. The RNA concentration and purity of
each sample was assessed using a NanoDrop 2000 spectrophotometer (Thermo Scientific, Massachusetts, USA) and the integrity
was measured with the Agilent 2100 Bioanalyzer LabChip RNA 6000 Nano kit (Agilent Technologies UK Ltd, Cheadle, UK) in approx-
imately 15% of samples. RNA was then stored at �80�C. cDNA was made by random-primed reverse transcription of 100 ng adipose
RNA or 200 ng leukocyte RNA with the AffinityScript Multi Temperature cDNA Synthesis Kit (Agilent) at a synthesis temperature of
42�C. cDNA was stored at �20�C.
We initially chose to analyze PER3 and BMAL1, as these are representative of the ‘positive’ and ‘negative’ clock gene loops, and
the genes that exhibited the most robust whole blood circadian rhythms in our hands [18]. We also analyzed the related canonical
clock gene PER2 in WAT samples. RT q-PCR was carried out with the Brilliant III Ultra-Fast master mix and ROX reference dye
(Agilent, Mx3005P). PER2 primers and probes were 50-AAGCCCACATCACATCTCC-30 (PER2-Forward), 50-CACTGCACCCCTG
AAAATAC-30 (PER2-Reverse), [FAM]ACTCAGTCTGACAGCTTGCGACTGCAT[BHQ1] (PER2-Probe). All other TaqMan gene specific
probes and primers have been reported previously [18]. All samples were run in triplicate. The thermal profile consisted of 3 min at
95�C followed by 15 s at 95�C and 20 s at 60�C (40 cycles). Ct values were calculated with an automated, amplification based
threshold, adaptive baseline and moving average in MxPro v4.10 (Stratagene). Relative gene expression was then calculated accord-
ing to the DDCt method. Within each triplicate outliers were removed if the difference between replicate and triplicate mean exceeded
2SD of differences within a gene.

 QUANTIFICATION AND STATISTICAL ANALYSIS
The phase of the melatonin rhythms was calculated as the 25% dim light melatonin onset (DLMO), i.e., the time at which melatonin
reaches 25% of the peak concentration [53]. Melatonin and cortisol data were plotted relative to clock time, whereas all other data
were plotted relative to each individual’s DLMO in that constant routine. Data were grouped into time bins, the sizes relative to the
sampling frequency for that parameter; 1 hr for melatonin, cortisol and subjective measures, 2 hr for blood gene expression, plasma
glucose, TAG and insulin, and 4 hr for adipose gene expression.
Analysis of all temporal profiles was first carried out using a 2-way repeated-measures ANOVA, with time of day and meal schedule
as the two independent variables, both of which were repeated-measures. Circadian phase for melatonin in each participant was
assessed using DLMO, as described above. Phase assessment for other parameters was estimated by deriving acrophases
(peak times) from cosinor analysis. The effect of the delayed meals on that measurement’s acrophase was assessed by a paired
t test of individual phase; the test was one-tailed when a one-directional effect, i.e., a delay, had been hypothesized.
Paired t tests were also used to compare the average concentrations of plasma glucose, insulin and triglyceride. The peak con-
centration of a glucose rhythm was estimated by calculating the mean average of the numerically highest value within each data se-
ries and its two immediately adjacent time points. Similarly, the lowest concentration was estimated by averaging the numerically
lowest value and its two immediately adjacent time points. Average peak and trough concentrations in the two constant routines
were analyzed by 2-way repeated-measures ANOVA.
In order to minimize type 1 statistical errors (i.e., false positives), Bonferroni corrections were applied to critical p values. For anal-
ysis of plasma molecules (melatonin, cortisol, glucose, insulin, triglyceride), a correction factor of 5 was employed, resulting in a crit-
ical p value of 0.01. For analysis of adipose gene expression (PER2, PER3, BMAL1), a correction factor of 3 was employed, resulting
in a critical p value of 0.017.
Data are provided as both grouped and individual values. Grouped data are presented as mean ± SEM, with relevant n values
described in the figure legends. Analyses were performed using Graphpad Prism 7.0 software.
