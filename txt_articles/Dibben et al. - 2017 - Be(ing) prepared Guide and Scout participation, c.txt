ABSTRACT
Background Mental health is a major concern in many
countries. We explore whether youth participation in the
Scouts and Guides could protect mental health in later
life and in particular whether it might reduce inequalities
in mental health associated with early life socioeconomic
position.
Methods Using the 1958 birth cohort National Child
Development Study, we tested whether Scouts–Guide
attendance was associated with mental health (SF-36,
Mental Health Index (MHI-5)) controlling for childhood
risk factors and interacted with social class.
Results Of the 9603 cohort members, 28% had
participated in the Scouts–Guides. The average MHI-5
score was 74.8 (SD 18.2) at age 50. After adjustment,
for potential childhood confounders, participation in
Scouts–Guides was associated with a better MHI-5 score
of 2.22 (CI 1.32 to 3.08). Among those who had not
been a Scout–Guide, there was a gradient in mental
health at age 50 by childhood social position, adjusting
for other childhood risk factors. This gradient was absent
among those who had been a Scout–Guide. Scout–
Guides had an 18% lower odds of an MHI-5 score
indicative of mood or anxiety disorder. The findings
appeared robust to various tests for residual
confounding.
Conclusions Participation in Guides or Scouts was
associated with better mental health and narrower
mental health inequalities, at age 50. This suggests that
youth programmes that support resilience and social
mobility through developing the potential for continued
progressive self-education, ‘soft’ non-cognitive skills, self-
reliance, collaboration and activities in natural
environments may be protective of mental health in
adulthood.
INTRODUCTION
Mental health is a major concern in many coun-
tries, with a high cost to society and individuals,
particularly in middle age1 when socioeconomic
health inequalities are at their greatest.2 3 The con-
siderable amounts of primary care time spent
addressing mental health issues and increasing
expenditure on mental health prescribing4 mean
effective preventive interventions are important.
There is also evidence that an adverse socio-
economic
situation
in
childhood
has
deleteri-
ous effects on mental health in later life and
social advantage is protective.5 6 What can be done
to improve mental health, and reduce the long-
term
impacts
of
socioeconomic
adversity
in
childhood?
Programmes
which
enable
an
individual
to
develop capabilities and resilience are known to
have a positive effect on outcomes in youth,7 par-
ticularly those focused on ‘positive youth develop-
ment’8 aimed at developing: social, vocational and
cognitive competence; self-confidence; connection
to others; respect for societal and cultural rules and
caring and compassion.9 It is plausible that the
skills, capabilities and resilience acquired in youth
development schemes will also be protective of
later life mental health, but evidence about the per-
sistence of benefits from these programme is almost
entirely absent. W
e hypothesised that exposure to
such programmes over the long-term may have a
lasting effect. Crucially however, we also hypothe-
sised that, for children from less advantaged back-
grounds at home and school, the abilities and
experience gained in this kind of youth develop-
ment programme would be particularly important
and might provide access to skills that their peers
acquire as part of their advantaged position. In
order to understand the potential long-term impact
of structured youth programmes, we carried out a
prospective cohort study of later life mental health
of individuals (aged 50) who had been Scouts–
Guides in the 1970s, a movement whose methods,
at that time, were close to those identified as key to
‘positive youth development’10 and, though opera-
tionalised
through
local
organisations,
were
managed, to ensure consistency, through detailed
programmes and standards governed by regional
oversight.11 12 W
e ask whether:
1. Childhood participation in Scouts–Guides is
independently associated with better mental
health at age 50?
2. Childhood
participation
in
Scouts–Guides
reduce inequalities in adult mental health asso-
ciated with early life socioeconomic position?
METHODS
Study design and population
W
e used the National Child Development Study
(NCDS), an ongoing cohort study of people born
in the UK in a single week in 195813 (n∼17 500).
W
e used the information on the 9790 study
members who were interviewed age 50 in 2008
(the most recent measurement of mental health).
Analysis of attrition in the NCDS (by age 45) sug-
gests that these study members are broadly repre-
sentative of the surviving cohort.14 Although the
NCDS data would support a prospective cohort
design assessment of effect of Scout–Guide attend-
ance in childhood on mental health in later life,
there are multiple threats to the validity of such an

e were particularly concerned about factors
affecting a young person’s probability of attending Scouts–
Guides, which could also be protective of mental health in later
life. To test for this possibility, we used three approaches. First,
we
explored
a
form
of
‘negative
control’
exposure.16
Specifically, we investigated whether attendance at other types
of organisations (voluntary groups and the church), and other
outside school clubs, which might have a similar set of common
factors encouraging attendance and which might be protective
of mental health in later life, were also associated with better
later life mental health, conditioning on scouts–guides attend-
ance. The absence of an association would suggest that an
unmeasured common factor was not confounding the scout–
guide association, while the existence of an association would
be ambiguous with an unmeasured common factor and a third
factor, independent of scout–guide attendance, but acting in a
pathway through the other types of organisation on mental
health, being possible. Second, we sought evidence of a dose–
response relationship, exploring whether fractions of attendance
were related to better mental health. Third, we explored
whether the Scout–Guide association was weaker in regions
with a higher proportional attendance which might suggest
Scout–Guides not being the causative agent. Collectively, these
strategies provided a strong test of whether residual confound-
ing or inadequate control (through measurement error) affected
the study results.
Outcome measure
The Mental Health Index (MHI-5) of the SF-36 item question-
naire is a well-validated instrument comprising five items, repre-
senting four major mental health dimensions.17 18 These items
ask about the amount of time during the past 4 weeks a person
has ‘(1) been a very nervous person?; (2) felt calm and cheer-
ful?; (3) felt downhearted and low?; (4) been a happy person?;
and (5) felt so down in the dumps that nothing could cheer you
up?’. Items are combined to form a scale varying between 0 and
100, with higher scores indicating better mental health. An indi-
cator of potential mood or anxiety disorders was derived using
a cut-off score of 65 points or less.19
Variables
Respondents were asked aged 50 whether they had/were a
member of: Scouts–Guides, religious group or church organisa-
tion, or voluntary service group. W
e used variables collected at
the appropriate sweeps of the NCDS to control for childhood
factors which might affect Scout–Guide participation and later
life mental health. These were sex, family social class, familial
history of mental health and family aspiration for the child.
Social position was measured using the Cambridge Social
Interaction and Stratification (CAMSIS) scale20 and Register
General’s Social Class (RGSC). Family history of mental illness
was asked age 7, specifically focusing on ‘Neurosis’. Family
aspiration was estimated from parents’ desire that their child
leaves school at the minimum age, asked at age 11. A question
asked aged 11 on the ‘frequency pupil goes to clubs outside
school’ was used to estimate attendance and participation in
other types of clubs but not Scout–Guides. The aggregated pro-
portion of cohort members in a Government Office Region
who were in the Scouts–Guides in 1974 was calculated and
centred by subtracting the UK mean participation rate. Other
childhood behaviours were captured by questions on1 how
often they played indoor games or sport at age 16, and2 played
outdoor games or sport at age 16.
Statistical analyses
Of the ∼17 500 initial study members, some 9790 were inter-
viewed in 2008. Of these, only 4020 had complete cases.
Multiple imputation (MI) using chained equations was used to
impute values for the missing data, with the data assuming to be
missing at random (MAR), given covariates predicting missing-
ness. T
en imputations were run separately for those who had or
not been a Scout–Guide. The patterns of missingness and MI
model
are
described
fully
in
the
online
supplementary
appendix. Of the 9790 cases available, 187 were excluded (105
were current Scout–Guides and 82 were missing on variables
used within the MI model). This represents a minor loss of
information (1.2% of cases) but enabled a more parsimonious
MI model to be estimated.
The analysis presented in this paper is based on MI data sets.
A complete case analysis was also carried out. Stata V
.13 was
used (Stata Statistical Software: Release V
.13 [program]. College
Station, T
exas: StataCorp LP
, 2013.), with the MHI-5 score
modelled using ordinary least squares (OLS) regression report-
ing β-coefficients, SEs and model fit (R2). The unadjusted OLS
estimate for the association between being a Scout–Guide and
MHI-5 score was compared with estimates adjusting for child-
hood confounders, and for regional participation rate in Scout–
Guides. The sensitivity of the analysis to non-normality in the
MHI-5 score was tested through replication with a suitable
transformation and is shown in the online supplementary
materials. The probability of mood or anxiety disorders (based
on an MHI-5 score of <65) was modelled using logistic regres-
sion adjusting for childhood confounders with ORs and 95%
CIs reported. p Values indicting the level of statistical signifi-
cance are reported with asterisks. Adjusted predicted values at
mean values of MHI-5 score were estimated based on OLS
models, including interaction terms between father’s CAMSIS
and Scout–Guide membership, and father’s RGSC and Scout–
Guide membership.
RESULTS
Of the 9603 cases, 28% had been Scouts–Guides (table 1).
There was little variation in attendance by parental social pos-
ition. Participation in Scouts–Guides varied across Britain, being
less likely for those who lived in W
ales during in childhood, and
more likely in for those who lived in Scotland. Few parents of
cohort members, asked in 1969, hoped their children would
leave school at the minimum age (5.3%). This response was far
less likely (2.8%) among those whose children were attending
Scouts–Guides. Those who were Scouts–Guides were also 2–3
times as likely to have been, or still be, a member of church or
voluntary groups. Attendance was not related to familial history
of mental illness.
Table 2 shows results from linear modelling of the MHI-5
score. Model 1 shows a mean mental health score of 74.0 for
non-Scouts–Guides (range 0–100). Past participation in Scout–
Guides was associated with a 2.7 point higher score. In model
2, controlling for the childhood risk factors listed in the table
title, the Scout–Guide association was reduced slightly to 2.2.
Scout–Guide attendance among cohort members in the 1970s
varied regionally (table 1). In model 3, we allowed the Scout–
Guide mental health association to vary by regional participa-
tion rate. The Scout–Guide association was strengthened slightly
(to 2.3 points) and this model explained 3% of the variance in
the mental health score. Scouts–Guides association was not
notably weaker in areas with high participation. Unless some
unmeasured variables were influencing participation rate and

 mental health, this suggests the absence of residual confounding.
Attendance of either scouts (male only model 4) or guides
(female only model 5) had a similar association with mental
health.
Previous or current participation in voluntary and church
groups was not associated with better mental health in any of
the three models (tables 2 and 3). This suggests that there was
not a common unmeasured variable affecting attendance of all
these organisations and mental health, confounding the main
finding.
Table 3 shows the odds of having a mood or anxiety disorder,
controlling for the childhood variables. Scouts–guides had an
18% lower odds of an MHI-5 score indicative of mood or
anxiety disorder.
The adjusted predictions at the means, for the models asses-
sing interaction between childhood socioeconomic position and
Scout–Guide attendance, are shown in figure 1A for individuals
by their father’s CAMSIS score (score 1–100 (highest social pos-
ition)) and in figure 1B for individuals by their father’s RGSC
with inequality slope fitted. There was a strong gradient in
mental health by childhood social position for those who had
not been a Scout–Guide, adjusting for other childhood risk
factors (figure 1A, B). Lower social position was associated with
∼3 points worse mental health score in figure 1A (slope,
p<0.001). In contrast, there appeared to be no or at least a
weaker (figure 1A) (slope, p=0.172) socioeconomic gradient for
those who had been a Scout–Guide.
Figure 2 shows the mental health score associated with the
estimated frequency of attendance at out of school clubs at age
11. There is no evidence of a dose–response relationship based
on estimating scout–guide attendance from a question on
attendance of outside school clubs at age 11. However, the dif-
ference between those who were not Scouts–Guides, but
attended other outside school clubs most days, and those who
attended Scouts–Guides was not attenuated compared with the
overall Scout–Guide effect of 2.22 (for model 2). This suggests
that although there might be a common unmeasured early life
effect making attendance at any type of outside school clubs
more likely, while also being protective of later life mental
health, it does not explain the Scout–Guide mental health asso-
ciation, otherwise there would be no difference in mental health
between these two groups.
DISCUSSION
In this prospective cohort study, we found evidence that having
been a member of the Guides or Scouts in the 1970s was

appears to reduce perhaps even remove inequalities in adult
mental health associated with early life socioeconomic position.

 This suggests that Scout–Guide attendance may be protective,
instituting a resilience to stressful life events that may lead to
mental ill health or increase the chances of achieving states in
adult
life
that
are
associated
with
better
mental
health.
The relationship does not appear to be explained by potential
confounding factors, notably familiar characteristics such as par-
ental attitudes to education or familial history of mental health
which might have affected the likelihood of a child being a
Scout–Guide and mental health in later life. Our findings
support those of the one other study that we are aware of, that
has looked at the relationship between having been Scouts and
mental health.21
Possible explanations and implications
Many of the elements that make up the Scout–Guide approach to
youth development are implicated in better adult mental health.
It is suggested, for example, that there are benefits for mental
health from a range of lifestyle factors, including exercise, nutri-
tion and diet, contact with nature and the outdoors, positive
social relationships, recreation, relaxation and stress manage-
ment, religious and spiritual involvement and contribution and
service.22 During the 1970s, the Guide ‘method’ had evolved
into an ‘eight point plan’, aimed at developing not only the trad-
itional ideas of: character, out-of-doors skills and challenges,
fitness, homecraft skills and service, but also creative ability, mind
and relationships, and a focus on personal development then
rather simply character development.11 Similarly, the Scouts were
focusing on a system of progressive self-education based on: pro-
mises (laws), active learning, interactions within small groups and
stimulating individual-driven self-learning through awards.12
The movement’s methods were based on a system of progres-
sive self-education taking place in the context of small peer
groups with adults guiding the process.11 23 Not being purely
recreational and unstructured, as a youth sport club might be,24
it used activities to allow young people to learn ‘to know’, ‘to
be’, ‘to do’ with adults assisting, rather than directing. Perhaps,
this set of ‘capabilities’ for continued self-learning enable the
participants to structure and run their adult lives in a way that is
relatively more protective against mental ill health. It may also
be that these activities develop ‘soft’ non-cognitive skills, such as
confidence, personality, motivation, charm, that are increasingly
recognised as important for achieving adult social position25
and are therefore more socially mobile.
There is also an emphasis in both movements on the use of
outdoor environments and physical activity.12 26 Evidence sug-
gests that one of the most important predictors of whether
adults spend time in natural environments is whether they did
so regularly as children.27 There is now evidence that exposure
to
natural
outdoor
environments
is
protective
of
mental
health.28 Populations with greater exposure to natural environ-
ments
have
reduced
socioeconomic
inequalities
in
mental
well-being,29 show cognitive benefits30 and better emotional
well-being, with restorative experiences acting as the mediating
factor.31 Physical activity is an important aspect of Scout–Guide
practice, not premised on excellence at a particular activity10
but rather on participation. The benefits of physical activity for
protecting or improving mental health are well established.32
Scouts–Guides use small groups to enable young people to
learn about relationships, understand their own competences
and to become more self-reliant.23 It may be that this early
exposure to the skills needed to work with small group enables
adults to more effectively develop later life social networks.
Social interaction, in particular having friends, has been identi-
fied as being beneficial for emotional well-being for adults of a
range of ages.33 It may also help individuals to engage with
‘local sociability’ and ‘community organisation’,34 if it exists in
places they have lived, and thus benefit from informal reci-
procity and social capital, more generally.
Strengths and limitations of the study
This study used a prospective cohort design, controlling for
many of the factors that might affect participation in Scouts–
Guides and later life mental health. Most of these measures
were collected in the appropriate cohort sweep. The possibility
of residual confounding, particularly due to missing or poorly
measured socioeconomic variables, was further examined using
three methods, a negative exposure control, an exploration of
‘dose–response’ and a measure of differing regional rates of
Scouts–Guide attendance. Although there was no evidence of a
dose–response relationship, the other methods supported the
plausibility of a causal relationship.

 There
were,
however,
some
weaknesses
in
the
study.
Information on Scouts–Guide attendance was collected retro-
spectively, and there may therefore be recall bias. However, it
seems unlikely that memory of attending would be associated
with present mental health state. The negative exposure controls
used were slightly non-standard. T
ypically, these are chosen
because, a priori, there is no expectation they will be related to
the outcome of interest, that they do is then taken as an indica-
tion of residual confounding. This would not be the case with
voluntary group, church membership or other outside school
clubs which might all, in theory, enhance social or other skills.
However, they are starkly different from the structured and
deliberate programme offered by Scouts–Guides, aimed at devel-
opment. In this study, there was no positive relationship
between the negative exposure controls and mental health, sup-
porting the conclusion of no, attendance-related, common con-
founder. The dose–response measure was estimated from a
question asked at aged 11 that may not necessarily relate to the
period of attendance of scouts–guides. This may explain why
there was no dose–response identified. In the absence of an
instrumental variable, with exposure varying independently of
any predictors of mental health, regional difference in participa-
tion in Scout–Guide troops was used. This measure will not def-
initely be exogenous with, for example, the possibility that a
higher regional proportion of families and communities sup-
porting the Scout–Guiding also creating an early life environ-
ment that was protective of later life mental health. However,
for the Scout–Guide association with mental health to have
been confounded by this ‘collective’ influence would require
considerable variation to exist across the regions in the UK
(because of the large variation in regional attendance levels).
This seems implausible. While there were weaknesses in all four
of the strategies used to assess whether non-causal associations
might be confounding the relationship of interest, they all sug-
gested residual confounding did not produce the positive
association.
There were missing data necessitating the use of MI with its
prerequisite assumptions. A large number of variables were used
in the imputation model and analysis which could plausibly
have affected the chance of not responding to a question. W
e
also produced separate imputation models for those who had
and had not been Scouts–Guides in the case of non-additive
relationship with the key variable. The analysis was fully repli-
cated for the complete case data set; we found no substantive
differences between the two. W
e also conducted sensitivity ana-
lysis with the assumption that the data are MNAR. The results
are consistent with those for the MAR assumption, suggesting
the MAR assumption is reasonable (see online supplementary
material). Sample attrition may have led to differential patterns
of non-response between 1958 and 2008 (aged 50). However,
analysis of attrition in the NCDS (by age 45) suggests that these
study members are broadly representative of the surviving
cohort and that the patterns of non-response were not differen-
tial with respect to the key variables analysed within our
study.14
In this paper, we found evidence that participation in the
Guides and Scouts in youth has a positive association with
mental health some 40 years later in life. Crucially, the effect
appeared particularly strong for children growing up in low
social position households, ameliorating inequalities in later life
probability of mental health based on childhood socioeconomic
position. Given the relatively high cost to individuals and
health systems of poor mental health in middle age, encour-
aging interventions in youth that are low cost and available
worldwide through existing institutional structures may be an
important and cost-effective policy response. It also suggests
that future work could usefully investigate the long-term
impact of other types of organised activities in childhood and
youth.
What is already known on this subject
▸ Developmental youth programmes fostering: social,
vocational and cognitive competence; self-confidence;
connection to others and caring and compassion, are shown
to have a positive effect on well-being in the short term.
▸ There is evidence that low or adverse socioeconomic status
in childhood has deleterious effects on mental health in
later life and social advantage is protective.
▸ There is little research on whether developmental youth
programmes have a long-term impact on mental health.
What this study adds
▸ In this prospective birth cohort study of 9603, participation
in Guides or Scouts was associated with significantly better
mental health at age 50 and a reduction in adult mental
health inequality associated with socioeconomic status
position in childhood.
▸ Given the cost to health systems and individuals of poor
mental health in adult life, interventions in youth, in
particular those provided by volunteers, could be a
cost-effective policy option.
