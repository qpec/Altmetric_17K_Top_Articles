During neurotransmission, synaptic vesicles undergo multiple rounds of exo-endocytosis, involving recycling and/or degradation of
synaptic proteins. While ubiquitin signaling at synapses is essential for neural function, it has been assumed that synaptic proteostasis
requires the ubiquitin-proteasome system (UPS). We demonstrate here that turnover of synaptic membrane proteins via the endolyso-
somal pathway is essential for synaptic function. In both human and mouse, hypomorphic mutations in the ubiquitin adaptor protein
PLAA cause an infantile-lethal neurodysfunction syndrome with seizures. Resulting from perturbed endolysosomal degradation, Plaa
mutant neurons accumulate K63-polyubiquitylated proteins and synaptic membrane proteins, disrupting synaptic vesicle recycling
and neurotransmission. Through characterization of this neurological intracellular trafficking disorder, we establish the importance
of ubiquitin-mediated endolysosomal trafficking at the synapse.
Introduction
The ubiquitin code involves post-translational modifica-
tion of target proteins by covalently attaching ubiquitin
(Ub) via lysine residues, coordinating diverse and essential
processes. Disruption of Ub-mediated signaling causes a
range of disease phenotypes including cancer, immune
deficiency, diabetes, and neurodegeneration.2 The ubi-
quitin code is complex, with polyUb chains formed by
covalent attachment to lysines (K) present on ubiquitin
itself. The precise lysine residue used in linkages dictates
the structure of the chains, altering the outcome for the
target protein; Lys48 (K48) polyUb chains are primarily
involved in proteasomal targeting, whereas Lys63 (K63)
polyUb chains are involved in signaling, DNA repair, or
endocytosis. Interpretation of this code is mediated by
diverse Ub-binding proteins via their Ub-binding domains
(UBDs), which show differential affinity to the various
ubiquitin modifications.3
Presynaptic terminals undergo extensive membrane
remodeling
during
synaptic
activity,
with
repeated
rounds of exo-endocytosis of synaptic vesicles (SVs).
Sustained neurotransmission depends on high-fidelity
sorting of synaptic proteins during SV recycling.4 This
is essential for neural function because too little or
too
much
of
critical
synaptic
membrane
proteins,
including SV2 and SNAP25, results in seizures, synaptic
dysfunction, and early lethality.5–9 How this process is
regulated and the involvement of ubiquitin signaling
remains unclear.
Ubiquitin signaling has long been known to play a role
in synapse development and plasticity,10 but this is gener-
ally attributed to the dependence of synaptic proteostasis
on the UPS.11–13 Indeed, acute depolarization of isolated

 synaptosomes causes a global decrease in Ub-modified pro-
teins, highlighting the rapid turnover rate of polyUb-pro-
teins presynaptically.14 In the case of neurodegenerative
disease, proteotoxic accumulations of Ub are noted as a
hallmark,15 although in several of these disorders, the
earliest symptoms are synaptic dysfunction.16 Exactly
how this ubiquitin signaling is acting locally at the
synapse to regulate normal presynaptic function is unclear.
An alternative to the exclusively UPS-based model of
synaptic proteostasis was first suggested decades ago
whereby synaptic membrane
protein turnover could
involve endolysosomes.17 However, subsequent work has
focused on exploring neuronal-specific ‘‘sort-and-degrade’’
mechanisms for synaptic cargos via endosomal interme-
diates whereupon the tie to Ub signaling has been
obscured.18,19 Results from two recent cell-based studies
suggest that Ub signaling in synaptic vesicle turnover
needs revisiting.1,20
Here we describe, in four families, a severe early-onset
neurodysfunction syndrome characterized by profound
developmental delay and seizures resulting from homozy-
gous mutations in the gene encoding ubiquitin binding
protein
Phospholipase
A2
Activating
Protein
(PLAA
[MIM: 603873]). PLAA binds ubiquitin through two
UBDs, a high-affinity WD40 b-propeller, and a low-
affinity PFU (PLAA family of Ub-binding) domain.21,22
PLAA is the highly conserved ortholog of yeast Ufd3/
Doa1 (FungiDB: YKL213C; 40% protein ID), which has
well-documented roles in targeting ubiquitylated proteins
for degradation through the ubiquitin-proteasome system
(UPS) via interactions with the segregase p97/CDC48,21,23
as well as regulating levels of free ubiquitin.24 Together
with CDC48, Doa1 is suggested to play roles in diverse
degradative processes including mitochondria-associated
degradation (MAD)25 and starvation-induced degradation
of mature ribosomes (ribophagy).26 Independent of its
role in regulating free ubiquitin, Doa1 was shown to be
required for sorting specific ubiquitylated cargos to late
endosomes/MVBs for lysosomal degradation.27,28 Despite
the proposed roles for yeast ortholog Ufd3/Doa1 in Ub-
dependent trafficking, the role of mammalian PLAA re-
mains unclear.
We demonstrate that PLAA is required for the Ub-medi-
ated sorting of membrane proteins from the early to late
endosome, targeting them for lysosomal degradation. Un-
like in yeast, in the absence of PLAA we see no changes in
free ubiquitin, although we observe the specific accumula-
tion and altered processing of a subset of K63-ubiquity-
lated proteins. Importantly, we demonstrate that PLAA is
essential for neural function, through dual roles of (1) regu-
lating post-endocytic trafficking of signaling receptors
necessary for neural development and (2) directing sorting
of synaptic vesicle (SV) components during recycling,
essential for synaptic function. This work demonstrates
that ubiquitin-dependent endolysosomal proteostasis at
the synapse is essential at the level of complex neural net-
works in humans and mice.
Material and Methods
Subject Ascertainment
Affected individuals in families A–C were ascertained following
referral to the local NHS Regional Clinical Genetics Service. At
the time of referral and clinical assessment, no clinical laboratory
molecular genetic testing was available to confirm the working
clinical diagnosis in each family and the families were recruited
to a research study to investigate the molecular basis of the disor-
der. Research was conducted according to the principles expressed
in the Declaration of Helsinki and was approved by the local
Research Ethics Committees. All participants provided informed
consent for the collection of samples and subsequent analysis.
Family D was recruited with informed consent under an IRB-
approved protocol (KFSHRC).
Gene Mapping
Genome-wide genetic linkage studies were performed using
Affymetrix SNP arrays (10k array in A-IV-6 and A-IV-7 and 250k
in A-IV-1 and A-IV-8) in affected individuals (as described previ-
ously29 and Axiom in family D). Homozygous regions R2 Mb
were further analyzed by typing microsatellite markers in all
family members from whom DNA was available.
Exome Sequencing
Exome sequencing was performed on one affected child from all
families using the SureSelect Human All Exon 50Mb Kit (Agilent
Technologies UK, Cat. No G3370A). Sequencing was performed
with the SOLiD4 System (Applied Biosystems) with 50 bp frag-
ment reads (in families B and C) or the Illumina Analyzer IIx
with 76 bp paired end reads (in families A and D). Raw sequencing
reads were mapped to the GRCh37 reference human genome and
changes compared to this reference sequence identified. Analyses
focused on non-synonymous coding, nonsense, splice site vari-
ants, and indels involving exons. Potentially pathogenic muta-
tions were identified based upon being unknown variants or those
where the rare allele frequency was <1%, how well the site was
conserved throughout evolution, and re-examination of the
sequence reads containing potential mutations using the Inte-
grated Genome Viewer. Analysis of the 84 genes in the candidate
interval in family A revealed only one rare potentially pathogenic
variant in PLAA (Table S2). This c.68G>T mutation in PLAA was
found to segregate correctly by Sanger sequencing in families A,
B, and C.
Generation of Mouse Models
Animals were maintained in SPF environment and studies carried
out in accordance with the guidance issued by the Medical
Research Council in ‘‘Responsibility in the Use of Animals in
Medical Research’’ (July 1993) and licensed by the Home Office
under the Animals (Scientific Procedures) Act 1986. Plaa-null
mice (Plaatm1(NCOM)Cmhd, MGI:4880046) were generated as detailed
in Figure S2. PlaaG23V/þ mice (Plaaem1Pmi MGI:5828117) were
generated using the CRISPR-nickase Cas9 system as described in
Figure S4. Genotyping was performed using primers detailed in
Table S9.
Mouse Phenotyping
Gait Analysis
PlaaG23V/G23V and wild-type littermate control mice were videoed
in a custom-made gait analysis chamber. Each paw placement in

 2D was recorded manually using a custom macro written for
ImageJ (code available upon request). Parameters such as step
length, step time, and number of steps taken were calculated in
Excel. Mice were analyzed at a variety of ages from 4 to 16 weeks,
and altered gait was evident at all ages tested.
Grip Strength Test
Mice grip a metal grid attached to a sensor (Bioseb) with either
their forelimbs only or both fore- and hindlimbs and maximal
grip strength was recorded.
LacZ Staining
Adult Plaaþ/� brains were fixed briefly in 4% PFA/PBS for 1 hr at
4�C, then 200 mm vibratome sections were cut and collected
into PBS. E11.5 (embryonic day) Plaaþ/� embryos were fixed in
4% PFA/PBS for 20 min at 4�C. LacZ staining was performed as
described.30
Magnetic Resonance Imaging
Brains from 3-month-old animals were fixed in 4% PFA in the
skull, with septum broken to aid penetration, for 5 days at 4�C,
rotating. Brains were incubated in contrasting agent Dotarem
(Guebert) for 7 days. Imaging was performed on a 7-Tesla small
animal imaging system controlled by an Agilent VnmrJ 4
console (Agilent Technologies). The specimen was placed in
the center of a 26-mm volume coil (Rapid Biomedical) used
for
radiofrequency
transmission
and
reception.
Structural
imaging was accomplished using a 3D gradient echo sequence
with repetition time ¼ 30 ms, echo time ¼ 6.22 ms, flip
angle ¼ 50�. The acquisition matrix was 512 3 192 3 192 over
a 40 mm 3 17 mm 3 17 mm field of view, resulting in an image
resolution of 78 3 88 3 88 mm. The images were analyzed in Fiji,
using manual segmentation.
Transcriptomics
Plaaþ/þ or PlaaG23V/G23V brains (n ¼ 3 per genotype) were subdis-
sected into caudal (including cerebellum, medulla, and pons)
and rostral (cerebrum) regions. Total RNA was extracted using
QIAGEN RNAeasy Lipid mini kits, including on-column DNase
digestion as per manufacturer’s direction. Expression analysis
was performed using the Affymetrix GeneChip Mouse Transcrip-
tome Array 1.0 (Aros) and analyzed using Affymetrix Transcrip-
tome Analysis Software. Results were confirmed by qPCR using
Roche Universal Probe Library (UPL) System on a LightCycler
480. Primer and probe sequences are available upon request.
Neuromuscular Junction Morphological Analysis
Protocol for NMJ morphological analysis is described in the
legend of Figure S6. A minimum of 50 NMJs from a minimum of
3 fields of view were quantified per muscle. Pre-synaptic accumu-
lations were defined as near-spherical neurofilament-positive
structures that occurred at the pre-synaptic terminal. Sprouts
were defined as a neurofilament-positive process that extended
from the pre-synaptic terminal. Methods for NMJ transmission
electron microscopy are described in the legend of Figure S6.
NMJ Electrophysiology
Levator auris longus (LAL) muscles were dissected into HEPES-
buffered mammalian physiological saline (MPS; composition in
mM: Naþ 158, Kþ 5, Ca2þ 2, Mg2þ 1, Cl� 169, glucose 11, HEPES
5 [pH 7.2–7.4]). Intracellular recordings of spontaneous miniature
endplate potentials (MEPPs) and supramaximal nerve-evoked
EPPs (<10V, <0.2 ms stimulation pulses) were recorded using
glass microelectrodes filled with KCl (3M; resistance typically
20–30 MU) after selectively blocking muscle action potentials
using
m-conotoxin
GIIIB,
as
described
previously.31,32
Data
were acquired and analyzed using a combination of WinWCP
(Strathclyde Electrophysiological Software), Spike-2 (Cambridge
Electronic Design), Minianalysis (Synaptosoft), pCLAMP (Mole-
cular Devices), and Prism (Graphpad) software.
NMJ Synaptic Vesicle Recycling
Motor nerve terminals in isolated LAL muscles (dissected as above)
were bathed in MPS containing FM1-43 (8 mM) together with
rhodamine (TRITC)-a-bungarotoxin (5 mg/mL; both from Thermo-
Fisher Scientific) to counterstain endplate acetylcholine receptors.
One of the innervating intercostal nerves was stimulated con-
tinuously at 20 Hz for 10 min, and then NMJs were imaged, after
washing for >30 min in MPS, using confocal microscopy as
described previously.33,34 Images were processed for overall
brightness, contrast, and gamma only using Photoshop (Adobe)
and then analyzed using ImageJ.
Acute Cerebellar Slices
Cerebella were dissected from 3-month-old mice into ice-cold
modified artificial cerebrospinal fluid (ACSF) containing (in
mM): 60 NaCl, 118 sucrose, 26 NaHCO3, 2.5 KCl, 11 glucose,
1.3 MgCl2, and 1 NaH2PO4 at pH 7.4 when bubbled with 95%
O2:5% CO2. The cerebellar vermis was glued to the vibratome cut-
ting platform (Leica Biosystems) with cyanoacrylate adhesive.
200 mm-thick sagittal slices were cut and incubated for 30 min at
30�C in standard ACSF composed of the following (in mM): 119
NaCl, 2.5 CaCl2, 26 NaHCO3, 2.5 KCl, 11 glucose, 1.3 MgCl2,
and 1 NaH2PO4 at pH 7.4 when bubbled with 95% O2:5% CO2.
Slices were stored at room temperature until required, then trans-
ferred to a submerged recording chamber and superfused with
standard ACSF (3–5 mL min�1) at 30�C.
Purkinje Cell Electrophysiology
Whole-cell recordings were made from Purkinje cells voltage-
clamped at �70 mV using thick-walled borosilicate glass pipettes
pulled to 3–5 MU. For recording mIPSCs, the internal solution
contained (in mM): 150 CsCl, 1.5 MgCl2, 10 HEPES, 0.1 cesium
BAPTA, 2 sodium ATP, 0.4 sodium GTP, 5 QX-314 at pH 7.3.
NBQX (10 mM) and tetrodoxin (300 nM) were added to the
ACSF to isolate mIPSCs. Series resistances were <15 MU and
were compensated for by 85%. Currents were filtered at 6 kHz
and sampled at 10 kHz. Data was acquired and analyzed using
pClamp 10 (Axon Instruments).
Purkinje Cell Single-Cell Imaging
Whole-cell recordings from Purkinje cells were performed with an
internal solution containing (in mM): 0.2 Lucifer Yellow (Sigma,
L0144), 0.02 Alexa FluorAR 568 hydrazide (Invitrogen, A-10441),
125 K-gluconate, 15 KCl, 10 HEPES, 5 EGTA, 2 MgCl2, 0.4 NaGTP,
2 NaATP, and 10 Na-phosphocreatine at pH 7.4. Purkinje cells were
voltage-clamped at �60 mV for 25–30 min and complete cell
filling was monitored by Lucifer Yellow fluorescence. Slices were
then fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde in 0.1 M phosphate buffer
(pH 7.4) overnight at 4�C. Slices were washed twice in 0.1 M phos-
phate buffer (pH 7.4) and twice in dH2O then stored in Vectashield
(Vector Laboratories) at 4�C. Slices were wet-mounted with Vecta-
shield onto 0.13 mm thick borosilicate glass and imaged using a
Zeiss inverted LSM510 confocal microscope. Dendritic length
and surface area was analyzed using ImageJ software (NIH).
Mass Spectrometry
Plaaþ/þ or PlaaG23V/G23V brains (n ¼ 3 per genotype) were subdis-
sected into caudal (including cerebellum, medulla, and pons)
and
rostral
(cerebrum)
regions
and
were
homogenized
in
100 mM Tris-HCl (pH 7.5) in presence of protease and phospha-
tase inhibitors (Roche). Samples were homogenized with an
Ultra-Turrax T25 High-Speed Homogenizer System for 1 min on
ice and SDS was added to a final concentration of 2% SDS. Lysates
were sonicated and clarified by centrifugation. Samples were
708
The American Journal of Human Genetics 100, 706–724, May 4, 2017
 processed by a multi-protease FASP protocol as described.35 In
brief, the SDS was removed and the proteins were first digested
with Lys-C (Wako) and subsequently with Trypsin (Promega)
with an enzyme to protein ratio (1:50). 10 mg of Lys-C and Trypsin
digests were loaded separately and desalted on C18 Stage tip and
eluates were analyzed by HPLC coupled to a Q-Exactive mass spec-
trometer as described previously.36 Peptides and proteins were
identified and quantified with the MaxQuant software package,
and label-free quantification was performed by MaxLFQ.37 The
search included variable modifications for oxidation of methio-
nine, protein N-terminal acetylation, and carbamidomethylation
as fixed modification. Peptides with at least seven amino acids
were considered for identification. The false discovery rate, deter-
mined by searching a reverse database, was set at 0.01 for both
peptides and proteins. All bioinformatic analyses were performed
with the Perseus software. Intensity values were log-normalized,
0-values were imputed by a normal distribution 1.8 p down of
the mean and with a width of 0.2 p. Statistically significant vari-
ance between the sample groups was tested by a permutation-
based FDR approach and a Student’s t test with a p value cut-off
of 0.01. Total proteomic data are available via ProteomeXchange
with identifier PXD003140 and are summarized in Table S6.
Synaptic Preparations
Cerebella were lysed in SYN-Per Synaptic Protein Extraction Re-
agent (ThermoScientific) according to manufacturer’s instructions.
Homology Modeling and Mutation Analysis
The target WD40 seven-bladed b-propeller domain of human
PLAA was modeled by homology based upon the high-resolu-
tion crystal structure template of yeast Doa1-WD40 (PDB:
3ODT; chain B, 1.35 A
˚ resolution).22 The two sequences share
43% sequence identity and 60% similarity. The target-template
alignment
was
generated
based
upon
an
initial
multiple
sequence
alignment
of
related-divergent
orthologs
using
PROMALS38 and manually edited to optimize positions of sec-
ondary structure elements and gaps. A total of 50 models were
built for the human PLAA-WD40 using Modeler 9v1239 and
the model with the lowest objective function score was selected.
The selected 3D model was checked for valid stereochemistry us-
ing RAMPAGE40 (98% of residues in favored and allowed regions
of the Ramachandran plot); the packing quality was evaluated
using the WHATIF server41 (average quality control score
�0.52; to place this in context, incorrect models give scores of
< �3.0; lower quality models < �2.0; and the average quality
of 200 highly refined X-ray structures �0.5 [50.4]; and the
model assessed using the MetaMQAPII server42 [Global model
accuracy: GDT_TS: 81.07; RMSD: 2.2 A
˚ ]). The empirical force-
field FoldX43,44 under the YASARA45,46 molecular visualization
program was used to estimate the free energy difference (DDG)
stability change upon mutagenesis from wild-type (p.Gly23Val)
in silico. The FoldX ‘‘RepairPDB’’ option followed by ‘‘Mutate
residue’’ was used to calculate the stability change (number of
runs: 3; pH: 7; temperature: 298 K; ionic strength: 0.05 M;
VdW design: 2). The resulting mean energy is expressed in
kcal/mol, and the prediction decision on whether the mutation
destabilizes structure is based upon Schymkowitz et al.43 and
Guirois et al.44 where severely reduced structural stability DDG
is considered to be >1.6 kcal/mol. Intra-protein residue interac-
tions were determined using the Protein Interactions Calculator
(PIC).47 PyMol was used for 3D visualization, analysis, and figure
preparation.
MEF Culture
Mouse embryonic fibroblasts (MEFs) were maintained, trans-
fected, and processed for immunofluorescence with antibodies
detailed in Tables S7 and S8 as previously published.30 To assess
endocytic trafficking, cells were transduced with 30 particles per
cell of Bacman 2.0 Rab5GFP and Rab7RFP (CellLight, Molecular
Probes), incubated for 18 hr in media without serum, then
100 ng/mL EGF-Alexa-647 (Molecular Probes) was added in media
plus 10% serum for 10 or 15 min. Cells were fixed in 4% PFA, cos-
tained with DAPI, and mounted. Alternately, cells were transfected
with Rab5Q79L-RFP, EGFR-GFP, or DOP-Flag,48 incubated in media
without serum for 18 hr, then treated with ligands (100 ng/mL
EGF, 5 mM DPDPE [Abcam]) for 90 min. Cells were fixed and cos-
tained with anti-EEA1 and anti-FLAG antibodies (Table S7),
DAPI, and mounted.
For analysis of UPS and autophagy, cells were treated with
200 mM MG132 (Sigma) and/or 100 nM Bafilomycin-A1 (Sigma),
and/or starved in EBSS media (Invitrogen) for 3 hr. Cells were
rinsed twice in PBS and harvested by lysing in hot (100�C) SDS
buffer (0.01 M Tris-EDTA [pH 7.5], 1% SDS). Lysates were then
boiled at 100�C for 5 min, followed by brief sonication. After
SDS-PAGE on a variety of NuPAGE precast gels, proteins were
transferred to Nitrocellulose (Thermo Fischer Scientific) or Hy-
bond-P membranes (GE Healthcare Life Sciences). Membranes
were probed with antibodies detailed in Table S7. Images were
captured using an ImageQuant LAS 4000 (GE Healthcare Life
Sciences) and semiquantitative protein detection was done by
ImageJ.
UPS Activity Assay
Cerebella or MEFswerelysed in UPS buffer (10 mMTris, 1 mMEDTA,
1 mM EGTA, 250 mM sucrose, 1.5 mM MgCl2, 0.05% NP40, 5 mM
DTT, and 2 mM ATP). Proteasome activity was determined by incu-
bating equal amounts of protein with 1 mM fluorescent proteasome
substrates N-succinyl-Leu-Leu-Val-Tyr-7-amino-4-methylcoumarin
(Suc-LLVY-AMC: Sigma), Boc-Leu-Ser-Thy-Arg-AMC (Boc-LSTR-7-

strates for chymotrypsin, trypsin, and caspase-like activities of the
proteasome, respectively, with or without 1 nM MG132 (Sigma)

UPS Flux
UbG76V-GFP (a gift from Nico Dantuma, Addgene plasmid #11941)
was transfected into MEFs and mean GFP fluorescence intensity
was determined by FACS 72 hr after transfection. This reporter
contains the UFD signal of an N-terminal uncleavable ubiquitin
moiety UbG76V that serves as target for polyubiquitylation and
degradation by the proteasome.49

tagged Ubqln1, Fam63, or Eps15 UBDs were immobilized on
Halo-Link Resin (Promega) overnight at 4�C, washed. then incu-

Imaging and Image Analysis
Confocal images were captured with a Nikon A1R confocal micro-
scope. Color brightfield images were captured with an Olympus
Dotslide. Macroscopic images were captured on a Nikon AZ100
macroscope with a Qimaging Micropublisher 5 cooled color cam-
era (Qimaging). Image capture was performed using in-house
scripts written for IVision (BioVision Technologies). Image anal-
ysis was performed with ImageJ. For analysis of EGF in early and
late endosomes, each channel was background corrected with
‘‘RollingBall’’ and segmented to generate a binary image. Puncta
were counted using ‘‘Find Maxima.’’ Images were combined to
display only colocalization and the number of colocalizing puncta
counted using ‘‘Find Maxima.’’ Plotted in the figure: ‘‘early endo-
some’’ localization represents EGF colocalizing with Rab5 only,
‘‘late endosome’’ localization represents EGF colocalizing with
Rab7 only or Rab5 and Rab7. Analysis of membrane versus luminal
localization in Rab5Q79L endosomes used in-house scripts (avail-
able upon request) in which the user defines the membrane and
lumen based only on the red signal.
Statistics
Statistical analyses were carried out in Microsoft Excel or
GraphPad Prism6. Analysis of microarray data was performed in
Affymetrix Transcriptome Analysis Console v3.0 and proteomic
data in Perseus software.

Homozygous Mutation in PLAA Causes a Severe

In three consanguineous families, seven infants presented
with a severe neurodevelopmental disorder—originally
diagnosed as either PEHO (progressive encephalopathy
with edema, hypsarrhythmia, and optic atrophy [MIM:

c.68G>T (p.Gly23Val) missense substitution in PLAA (Phos-
pholipase A2-activating protein [GenBank: NM_001031689.
2]) (Figures 1 and S1), encoding a highly conserved ubiqui-
tin binding protein. We subsequently identified an individ-
ual from a fourth consanguineous family with a homozy-
gous c.68dupG (p.Leu24Profs*55) frameshift mutation
who also presented with a similar but more severe neurode-
velopmental disorder.
PLAA-associated neurodevelopmental disorder (PLAAND)
ischaracterizedatbirthbytruncalhypotonia,increasedlimb
tone and feeding difficulties, mildly dysmorphic facial
features, and hirsutism. Progressive limb spasticity, micro-
cephaly, and optic atrophy developed in the first year
(Figure 1F). Most had seizures that began between the first
week of life and 2 years (Table 1 and S1). Where electroen-
cephalogram(EEG)dataareavailable,electroclinicalseizures
with hyper-rhythmic discharges were observed. Affected
children die of apnea and recurrent pneumonia by 6 years
of age (range 12 days to 6 years) (Table 1 and S1). MRI brain
findings in the first year included a thin corpus callosum, de-
layed myelination, a simple immature overall gyral pattern,
particularly frontally, and large cavum septum pellucidum/
vergae (Figures 1A–1E). Scans after 1 year showed features
of cerebellar and cerebral atrophy.
Autozygosity mapping and exome sequencing identified
the homozygous mutations within PLAA, which segre-
gated in an autosomal-recessive manner in all four families
(combined LOD score of 4.52 for families A–C, Figure S1).
Although families A–C are not knowingly related, we
inferred that the c.68G>T (p.Gly23Val) mutation was
derived from a distant common ancestor, as it was in-
herited on the same haplotype (Table S2). The absence of
either homozygous variant in ~3,000 ethnically matched
control individuals and ExAC databases indicated these
were probably the pathogenic mutations. Homology
modeling of the N-terminal WD40 seven-bladed b-pro-
peller in PLAA established the p.Gly23Val variant is
buried within the innermost b strand of blade 2, where it
is
predicted
to
destabilize
structure
(mean

¼
2.6 kcal/mol). This WD40 b-propeller domain is one of
two UBDs found in PLAA, and the mutation lies close to
the interface involved in high-affinity ubiquitin binding
(monoUb Kd ~220 mM)21,22 (Figures 1G–1K).
PLAA Is Essential for Mammalian Development and
Endolysosomal Trafficking
As the function of mammalian PLAA is poorly understood,
we generated a Plaa-null mouse model (Figures S2A and
S2B). Expression studies confirmed ubiquitous expression
of Plaa, with endogenous PLAA localizing throughout
the cell, within the cytoplasm and nucleus (Figures S2C
and S2D). Plaa�/� embryos die in mid-gestation (Table
S3), with the few mutants surviving to E15.5 being runted
and anemic (Figure S2E).
Pinpointing a functional role for mammalian PLAA is
complicated by the diversity of roles described for yeast
Ufd3/Doa1, including regulating free ubiquitin levels and
trafficking of ubiquitylated proteins to various degradative
pathways. In the absence of PLAA, no compensatory
transcriptional changes in ubiquitin expression, global
changes in free ubiquitin, or accumulation of polyUb
chains were detected (Figure 2A). Moreover, proteasomal
activity was not globally perturbed in Plaa mutants; in
fact, decreased levels of ubiquitin-fusion degradation
(UFD) proteasomal reporter UbG76V-GFP suggest increased
proteasomal flux in the absence of PLAA (Figures 2B and
2C). In Plaa�/� mutants, we detected no compensatory up-
regulation of genes involved in Ub-based degradation
pathways including ERAD or MAD (Figure S3A).
Integral membrane proteins undergo endocytosis and
trafficking to the early endosome, where Ub-dependent
sorting either recycles these proteins back to the plasma
membrane or targets them for lysosomal degradation. This
involves recognition of Ub-modified cargos for Endosomal
Sorting Complexes Required for Transport (ESCRT)-depen-
dent internalization into late endosomal compartments,
710

 or multivesicular bodies (MVBs), ahead of fusion with the
lysosome.50 Ufd3 was shown to direct ubiquitylated cargo
for degradation via the MVB in yeast, by directly binding
ESCRT-0 subunits Hse1/STAM1 and Vps27/HRS.27 In Plaa-
null cells, localization of HRS is perturbed, without disrup-
tion of endosomal or lysosomal morphology, suggesting
that ESCRT-0 function may be disrupted (Figures 2D, 2E,
and S3B–S3E). To test the functional integrity of ESCRT-
dependent trafficking to the MVB/late endosome in the
absence of PLAA, we followed the internalization of
epidermal growth factor (EGF) after binding to the EGF Re-
ceptor (EGFR), which triggers endocytosis of both receptor
and ligand and subsequent ESCRT-dependent trafficking
to the lysosome for degradation. While initial endocytosis
of EGF to the early endosome is unaffected in Plaa-null cells,
it fails to efficiently reach the late endosome, indicating dis-
rupted trafficking from early to late endosomes (Figures 2F
and 2G). To allow visualization of distinct endosomal
membrane and lumen compartments, we expressed a
constitutively active Rab5Q79L and followed ligand-induced
internalization of EGFR and the neural G protein-coupled
receptor (GPCR) d-Opioid receptor (DOP) into the lumen
of the resulting enlarged endosomes.48 In the absence of
PLAA, these receptors/ligands remain trapped at the
membrane (Figures 2H–2J, S3F, and S3G). We conclude
that loss of mammalian PLAA disrupts ESCRT-0 localization

Reduced Levels of PLAA Result in Early-Onset Neural
Dysfunction and Premature Lethality
To confirm pathogenicity of the c.68G>T human muta-
tion and to provide an informative model of the human
disease, this mutation was introduced into the orthologous
mouse gene using CRISPR/Cas9 gene-editing (protein ID:
94%, Figures S4A and S4B). PlaaG23V/G23V mice have a
70% reduction in PLAA protein levels by western blot
(Figure 3A), confirming that the p.Gly23Val variant desta-
bilizes protein structure. In contrast to the embryonic
lethality of Plaa�/� mice, PlaaG23V/G23V are born at Mende-
lian ratios indicating this is a viable hypomorphic allele
(Table S4). PlaaG23V/G23V mutants exhibit early-onset neu-
rodysfunction phenotypes, which progressively deterio-
rate such that 50% of mutants must be culled by 6 months
(Figure 3B). Levels of PLAA abundance and/or function are
further reduced in PlaaG23V/� compound heterozygote
mice, resulting in accelerated decline with pronounced pa-
ralysis and respiratory distress (Figures 3A, 3B, and S4C)
and the pups die before weaning (P17–P21 [postnatal day
17–21]; Table S5). PlaaG23V/G23V brains are smaller than lit-
termates (Figure 3C) and MRI analysis reveals significant
reductions in corpus callosum and cerebellar volumes in
PlaaG23V/G23V brains, similar to the features reported in im-
aging of the human affected individuals (Figures 1A–1F
and 3D and 3E).
Tremor and motor disorders are detectable from P14 in
PlaaG23V/G23V mutants and P7 in PlaaG23V/� compound
mutants, including a range of neuromuscular weakness
and hypomotility phenotypes. PlaaG23V/G23V animals fail
to splay hindlimbs when suspended, whereas PlaaG23V/�
mice displaying a more pronounced clasping phenotype
(Figure 3F). PlaaG23V/G23V animals also exhibit reduced
grip strength, pronounced kyphosis, and muscle wasting
(Figures 3G and S4D).
PLAA Deficiency Disrupts Purkinje Cell Migration,
Dendrite Arborization, and Neurotransmission
Both PlaaG23V/G23V and PlaaG23V/� mice display altered gait,
disrupted balance, and early-onset postural tremor with
kinetic aspect, suggestive of central disturbances in the
cerebellar motor circuits relaying information related to
muscle coordination and balance (Figures 3H, 4A, and
S5D; Movies S1 and S2). This type of tremor has been pre-
viously linked to early central synaptic dysfunction in ro-
dents.51,52 Plaa is expressed in the postnatal brain, with
highest levels in the CA hippocampal neurons, cerebellar
granular cell layer, and Purkinje cells (PCs) (Figure 4B).
PlaaG23V/G23V animals display a significant reduction in
cerebellar volume that is more pronounced in PlaaG23V/�
mice,
which
show
additional
cerebellar
foliation
defects (Figures 3E and S5A–S5C). Transcriptome analysis
of PlaaG23V/G23V cerebella revealed decreased expression
of PC markers, with parallel increased glial and com-
plement-microglial markers suggesting reactive gliosis
(Figures S5E and S5F). Histological and immunofluores-
cent analysis revealed no reduction in PC density in
PlaaG23V/G23V cerebella (Figures 4C and 4D); instead, PCs
fail to form a uniform layer in PlaaG23V/G23V cerebella,
consistent with a defect in migration. PlaaG23V/G23V PCs
also show abnormal dendritic branching (Figures 4E and
4F). Together these results support a role for PLAA during
PC development, as opposed to degeneration.
To address how disrupted sorting of Ub-modified cargos
may underlie the mutant cerebellar phenotype, we under-
took an unbiased whole-proteome analysis of early symp-
tomatic PlaaG23V/G23V cerebella (aged 3 months). We found
no changes in protein levels suggestive of deregulated
MAD (i.e., mitochondrial function or turnover) or UPS
(i.e., proteasomal subunits) degradation in the absence of
PLAA; nor did we find evidence of cell loss (apoptosis). In
contrast, all proteins significantly increased in mutant
cerebella (>5-fold, FDR < 0.05) were involved in vesicular
trafficking (AP4S1, SNAP25, RAB22A, S100A11) or were re-
ceptors/ligands trafficked via the endolysosomal pathway
(VLDLR, GRN)53–58 (Figures 4G and 4H). Immunoblot
confirmed the upregulation of VLDLR, SNAP25, and
AP4S1 (Figures 4H and S5H–S5J), while transcriptional
analysis confirmed this upregulation was post-transcrip-
tional
(Figure
S5G).

 receptor) is required for cerebellum development and PC
migration.59 The defects in PC migration and dendrite
maturation, as well as the ataxia and tremor present in
PlaaG23V/G23V mice may, therefore, result from the accumu-
lation of dysfunctional VLDLR due to disrupted post-endo-
cytic trafficking to the lysosome.
To assess the functional competence of the PCs in
PlaaG23V/G23V cerebella, we performed whole-cell patch-
clamp recordings and analyzed spontaneous miniature
inhibitory
post-synaptic
currents
(mIPSCs).
Reduced
amplitude of mIPSCs, with no effect on frequency or decay
kinetics, was observed in PlaaG23V/G23V PCs, consistent
with a functional deficit in cerebellar outputs, which
may underlie the tremor and cerebellar ataxia observed
in these mice (Figures 4I–4K).
PLAA Is Required for Efficient Synaptic Vesicle Recycling
at NMJs
In addition to central defects, the muscle weakness and
wasting
observed
in
PlaaG23V/G23V
mice
may
reflect
involvement of the peripheral nervous system. Analysis
of PlaaG23V/G23V neuromuscular junctions (NMJs) revealed
that
every
endplate
was
fully
innervated.
However,
there were increased numbers of endplates with terminal
swellings and/or sproutings, typically a compensatory
response to a poorly functioning synaptic terminal60 (Fig-
ures 5A–5E and S6A–S6G). PlaaG23V/G23V muscle fibers had
decreased diameter, consistent with atrophy (Figure S7A).
NMJ disruption is detected as early as P14 in PlaaG23V/�
mice (Figures S6D–S6G). While the bulk of the presynaptic
swelling is accumulation of neurofilament (NF), increased
intensity and number of foci of synaptic vesicle protein 2
(SV2) were clear in PlaaG23V/� NMJs suggesting a disruption
in distribution and/or composition of synaptic vesicles
(SV) (Figures 5F–5H and S6D–S6G). Immunoblotting
confirmed synaptic accumulation of SV2 with an increased
high molecular weight smear in Plaa mutants, consistent
with disrupted SV2 degradation (Figure 5I). Furthermore,
PLAA itself was detected in synaptic preparations, support-
ing a putative direct function in regulating Ub sorting at
the synapse (Figures S5I and S5K).
Indeed, transmission electron microscopy (TEM) of
PlaaG23V/G23V levator auris longus (LAL) NMJs revealed
profound decreases in SV numbers with increased enlarged
endosomal and vacuolar structures (Figures 5J–5L and
S6H). Several pools of SVs exist, including the reserve, recy-
cling, and readily releasable pools, with distinct functional
properties and modes of regeneration, some involving
endocytic intermediates.4 A greater reduction in SVs not
tethered at the active zone (perhaps representing the recy-
cling or reserve SVs) was evident in PlaaG23V/G23V NMJs
(Figure 5M), which, together with the presence of promi-
nent enlarged endosomal and vacuolar structures, suggests
that Ub-mediated sorting via PLAA is required for efficient
SV biosynthesis or recycling.
To scrutinize SV recycling directly, we stained motor
nerve terminals in LAL muscles with FM1-43, which
selectively labels recycling SVs and other endocytic
compartments
in
an
activation-dependent
manner.
The general innervation pattern appeared normal, sug-
gesting that most terminals recycled vesicles sufficiently
to sustain neuromuscular transmission (Figures 6A and
6B). However, about 60% of motor nerve terminals in
PlaaG23V/G23V
animals
displayed
abnormal
FM1-43
uptake. This included localized swelling of terminal
boutons
or
punctate/fragmented
intense
staining,
consistent with the presence of enlarged endocytic
structures seen by TEM (Figures 6A–6C and 5J and
5K) and suggesting defective coupling of SV fusion
and recycling.
Intracellular recordings further revealed that upon
nerve stimulation a significant number of PlaaG23V/G23V
NMJs failed to respond or gave intermittent response
(Figure 6D). Of the PlaaG23V/G23V NMJs which responded,
EPP (end-plate potential) characteristics appeared normal
(Figures S7F–S7I). The mean frequency of spontaneous
MEPPs (miniature end-plate potentials) was increased
in PlaaG23V/G23V NMJs, together with an increased half-
decay time in some muscle fibers, indicating altered syn-
aptic function in PlaaG23V/G23V NMJs (Figures 6E, 6F, and
S7C–S6E). The incidence of spontaneous MEPPs with
amplitudes more than twice the mean (‘‘giant’’ GMEPPs)
was also significantly higher in PlaaG23V/G23V muscles
(Figure 6G). In conclusion, our results suggest that the
infantile neurodysfunction is a result of defective SV recy-
cling and synaptic function (Figure 6H).
Reduction of PLAA Leads to Impaired Trafficking
of K63-Ubiquitylated Substrates
To further characterize how intracellular trafficking de-
fects could underlie the phenotypic changes in Plaa
mutant brains, we investigated whether all polyUb spe-
cies accumulate as a result of general disruption in degra-
dation or whether specific subset of polyUb substrates are

 affected when PLAA function is reduced. Similar to null
MEFs, no compensatory changes in UPS subunit levels
or UPS flux are observed in PlaaG23V/G23V cerebella, sug-
gesting no general disruption of Ub-based degradation
(Figures S8A and S8B). Using brains from wild-type and
PlaaG23V/� cerebella at P17, we took advantage of recently
characterized small recombinant UBDs for binding pan-
Ub or with high selectivity to either K63- or K48-linked
polyUb.61,62 While not readily detectable without enrich-
ment, significant and specific accumulation of K63-
polyUb species is observed in PlaaG23V/� mutant brains
while only minor changes in pan-Ub or K48-polyUb
modified cargos are seen (Figures 7A and S8C–S8E). This
is consistent with a specific primary defect in post-endo-
cytic degradation of ubiquitylated membrane proteins, as
K63-polyUb is key for internalization of receptors into

Interestingly,

increased binding of the autophagy adaptor p62
to these accumulated K63-linked polyUb-modi-
fied proteins in PlaaG23V/� cerebella (Figures 7A
and 7B). Furthermore, the number of p62 foci
was increased in Plaa-null cells (Figures 7C and
7D), colocalizing with aberrantly localized HRS-
positive endocytic structures (Figures 7E and
S8G). To assay whether the accumulation of
p62 foci is a result of disrupted flow through
autophagy intermediates, we used the reporter
GFP-RFP-LC3 in Plaa�/� cells. This reporter allows
the concomitant assessment of the total autopha-
gosome pool size before and after fusion as this
tandem tagged reporter labels autophagosomes
(RFPþ and GFPþ) as well as autophagolysosomes
(RFPþ; GFP� due to pH sensitivity of GFP).
Plaa�/� cells show an overall increase in the
pool size of both LC3-positive structures, but no change
in the ratio of autophagosomes (yellow) to autophagolyso-
somes (red) (Figures S8F and S8H–S8J). This suggests that
in the absence of PLAA, there is an increase in basal

 autophagy without clear defects in fusion events. Reducing
PLAA function impairs endolysosomal trafficking, which
could trigger p62 recruitment to accumulating K63-linked
polyUb proteins on endosomes. We suggest that p62 at-
tempts to reroute this cargo for autophagic clearance, but
this rerouting via selective autophagy is much less efficient
and/or compromised such that reduction in PLAA disrupts
ubiquitin-dependent signaling events key for neural devel-
opment and synaptic function.
Discussion
PLAA Is Essential for Post-Endocytic Degradation
of K63-Ubiquitylated Cargo
The functional outcome of ubiquitylation is determined by
how ubiquitin signals are interpreted by a large number of
ubiquitin binding domain proteins, vastly increasing the
potential biological applications for this post-translational
modification (PTM). However, this complicates assigning

 specific functions to widely expressed adaptor proteins like
PLAA/Ufd3/Doa1, which have multiple distinct UBDs and
no catalytic activity. Indeed, the yeast ortholog Ufd3 has
been implicated in protein quality control through diverse
Ub-based sorting mechanisms, many of which involve
interaction with p97/VCP segregase, including ERAD,
UPS, and MAD.21,25 Unlike in yeast, loss of mammalian
PLAA does not affect levels of free ubiquitin, nor do we
detect accumulation of high-molecular-weight polyUb
species associated with impaired UPS- or mitochondrial-
associated degradation, which are frequently associated
with neurodegeneration. In yeast, Doa1 has been linked
to ribophagy, starvation-induced degradation of the 60S
ribosome.26 Recently mammalian PLAA, together with
VCP/p97, has been implicated in stress granule assembly,
mRNA-protein aggregates that form during translational
disassembly induced during stress,18 as well as lysophagy,
which involves the clearance of damaged lysosomes by
autophagy.68 However, these studies focused on the role
of PLAA in response to various cell stressors, so any homeo-

static role of PLAA, for example during
development, remained unclear.
In this study we demonstrate a
conserved role for mammalian PLAA
in Ub-mediated trafficking of mem-
brane proteins though the endolyso-
somal pathway. We demonstrate that
PLAA is essential for mammalian embryonic development.
PlaaG23V/G23V mice (homozygous for the human mutation
in families A–C) survive past weaning, so we conclude that
PLAAND-affected individuals possess hypomorphic PLAA
mutations, as we would not expect null mutations to be
compatible with life. The c.68G>T (p.Gly23Val) missense
mutation introduces steric clashes in the WD40 ubiquitin
binding
domain,
which
destabilizes
PLAA
protein.
Whether this additionally disrupts ubiquitin binding,
directly leading to defects in ubiquitin-based trafficking,
was not addressed; the significant reduction in protein
levels
probably
accounts
for
the
defects
observed,
including slowed removal of target proteins from mem-
branes leading to the observed K63 accumulation. The
c.68dupG (p.Leu24Profs*55) insertion is in exon 1 of
PLAA and so may escape nonsense-mediated decay;69 it is
possible that translation begins at the downstream methi-
onine (Met58), which would result in a N-terminally trun-
cated PLAA protein, missing part of the WD40 propeller,
which would likely also be highly destabilizing.

 After this manuscript was submitted, Zaccai et al.70 pub-
lished a missense c.2254C>T mutation in human PLAA re-
sulting in a non-destabilizing p.Leu752Phe change in the
PUL domain, causing a similar but milder clinical pheno-
type, which they diagnosed as leukoencephalopathy.
While their emphasis among their older cohort was on
white matter abnormality, the affected individuals we
describe in this study, who are younger in comparison,
also have evidence of white matter involvement (i.e., de-
layed myelination). It is conceivable that had they sur-
vived, they may have progressed to a comparable level of
leukodystrophy. Using our allelic series of mouse mutants,
we demonstrate a strongly dose-dependent requirement
for functional PLAA in neuronal function, brain develop-
ment, and viability. Together, these data support use of
the unifying term PLAA-associated neurodevelopmental
disorder (PLAAND), which covers the phenotypic spec-
trum
of
human
neurological
disease
resulting
from
different PLAA mutations. While the Zaccai paper focused
on misregulation of Phospholipase A2 activity and subse-
quent disruption of downstream Prostaglandin E2 induc-
tion as causative,70 we see no alteration in Phospholipase
A2 (PLA2) activity in our most severely affected Plaa
mutant brains (Figure S9).
We show that PLAA is required for ubiquitin-dependent
trafficking of receptors from early to late endosomes/
MVBs. In neurons, reducing PLAA function disrupts syn-
aptic structure and synaptic vesicle recycling, resulting
in
impaired
synaptic
function,
as
demonstrated
by
electrophysiology and gross phenotypes (tremor, ataxia,
neuromuscular weakness). We suggest that many of these
phenotypes are due to disrupted ESCRT-mediated endo-
cytic sorting. Indeed, a spontaneous destabilizing muta-
tion

results in early-onset neuromuscular weakness and hypoki-

tions of ubiquitylated synaptic proteins and disrupted SV
recycling.19

Reduction of PLAA Leads to Impaired Trafficking of K63-polyUb Substrates

(F) Schematic representation of PLAA-dependent trafficking defects through the endolysosomal system. PLAA is required for sorting of
Ub-modified membrane proteins into the lumen of MVB/late endosomes. Cargos become trapped on limiting membranes of abnormal
early endosome intermediates in Plaa mutants where they are concentrated by p62 adaptor protein for alternate lysosomal degradation
via autophagy. Alternately these proteins targeted for degradation may be re-routed via the recycling endosomes to the cell surface where
they may be functionally compromised (red).

 Consistent with a conserved role for PLAA in ESCRT-
dependent targeting of ubiquitylated membrane receptors
for lysosomal degradation, we see accumulation of K63-Ub
proteins in Plaa mutant brains. K63-linked Ub chains are
thought to be required for internalization into the MVB
lumen and, accordingly, ESCRT-0 proteins show preferen-
tial binding affinity to K63-Ub chains.63,65 Accumulation
of K63-ubiquitylated cargo has been reported in late-onset
neurodegenerative disorders such as Huntington disease
(MIM: 143100).71 We detect an accumulation of a subset
of K63-ubiquitylated proteins in mutant cerebella in
mice as young as P17. The very early-onset neural dysfunc-
tion (evident from birth in human and at least P7 in
mouse) is distinct from classical neurodegeneration, char-
acterized by age-related aggregation or cellular inclusions
of
ubiquitylated
proteins.72,73
This
implicates
PLAA-
directed K63-ubiquitin trafficking in neuronal develop-
ment. The abnormal Purkinje cell (PC) migration, den-
dritic tree morphology, and impaired VLDLR degradation
we see in Plaa mutant mice is consistent with disrupted
neuronal development. VLDLR is known to undergo ubiq-
uitin-dependent endolysosomal degradation in response
to Reelin signaling, where it controls PC migration.57,59
Moreover, human mutations in VLDLR (MIM: 192977)
are found in affected individuals with cerebellar ataxia
and intellectual disability74 (MIM: 224050). Interestingly,
at the top of our unbiased total proteomic analysis of
Plaa mutant cerebella were several proteins encoded by
human neurological disease genes with phenotypes over-
lapping with PLAAND (4 out of the top 6: SNAP25 [MIM:
616330], VLDLR [MIM: 224050], AP4S1 [MIM: 614706],
and GRN [MIM: 614706]), suggesting that Reelin signaling
is unlikely to be the only signaling pathway disrupted
upon PLAA reduction.
As well as targeting proteins for lysosomal degradation
through the endosomal pathway, K63-Ub chains have
been implicated in autophagy-mediated lysosomal degra-
dation, through autophagy adaptor protein p62, which
shows binding preference for K63-Ub chains.66,67 It has
recently been proposed that PLAA, together with VCP/
p97, is recruited to damaged lysosomes to promote lysoph-
agy, downstream of K63-linked polyUb and p62.68 Our re-
sults are consistent with the proposal that PLAA acts down-
stream of p62 and K63-Ub in rerouting cargo, but we do
not see evidence of lysosomal damage, nor defects in auto-
phagolysosome fusion in Plaa mutants. Instead, Plaa-null
cells display a marked increase in p62 foci, colocalizing
with aberrant HRS-positive endosomal structures. We pro-
pose that p62 attempts to consolidate and reroute K63-
ubiquitylated cargo trapped at the endosome to the lyso-
some via the autophagy pathway. Increasing autophagy
pharmacologically or genetically can ameliorate neurode-
generative conditions such as ALS (MIM: 105400), Hun-
tington, and Parkinson disease (MIM: 168600),75,76 raising
the possibility that pharmacomodulation of autophagy
could also be a therapeutic option for early synaptic
dysfunction observed in PLAAND and related disorders.
PLAA Regulates Sorting of Synaptic Membrane Proteins
Necessary for Synaptic Function
In addition to regulating neuronal signaling during brain
development, PLAA-dependent ubiquitylated cargo sort-
ing is required for synaptic structure and function. SVs
undergo repeated cycles of exocytosis, endocytosis, and
vesicle reformation: they are in essence specialized cycling
endosomes. In order to maintain their precise identity, spe-
cific mechanisms must enable the sorting of SV proteins
during recycling to preserve their composition and target
old or damaged proteins for degradation. Our studies iden-
tify ubiquitin-mediated sorting of synaptic membrane
components by PLAA as an essential feature of both central
and peripheral synapses.
Ubiquitin has been shown previously to play a key role
in synaptic development,77–79 but these studies focused
on the importance of regulating levels of ubiquitin locally
at the synapse. Synapses are particularly vulnerable to fluc-
tuations of ubiquitin levels as ubiquitin is synthesized at a
distance in the cell body and slowly moved by axonal
transport to the synapse.80 The levels of ubiquitin at the
synapse reflect a balance of distant synthesis with local
degradation by the proteasome. This degradation is moni-
tored by proteasome-associated DUBs like USP14, which
trim polyUb chains prior to degradation of conjugated sub-
strates to maintain free ubiquitin levels. Unlike Usp14 mu-
tants that show disturbances in ubiquitin homeostasis at
the synapse,79,81 Plaa mutants show no perturbation in
synaptic-free ubiquitin levels but still have pronounced
disruption of activation-based endocytosis, SV numbers,
and synaptic membrane protein content. We argue that
these observations support a primary role for ubiquitin
signaling in endosomal sorting at synapses, which is neces-
sary for synaptic plasticity. Importantly, it further suggests
that neurodysfunction need not arise from deregulated
synaptic proteostasis via the ubiquitin-proteasome system,
but instead through disruptions to the endolysosomal
degradative route.17,82,83 Independent support for this
comes from recent extensive quantitative proteomics
studies demonstrating that Ub-mediated degradation of
the majority of synaptic proteins is not by the proteasome,
but via an alternate route.20
Without signs of denervation or neuron loss, clear pre-
synaptic changes occur in Plaa mutant neuromuscular
junctions (NMJs). A reduction in SVs, particularly those
not at the active zone, which may represent the reserve
and/or recycling pool, is accompanied by accumulation
of enlarged endocytic structures. The abnormal trafficking
and accumulations of endocytic dye FM1-43, which marks
recycling SVs, demonstrates that although initial endocy-
tosis is not dependent on PLAA, subsequent sorting during
recycling is. SV component SV2 accumulates in Plaa
mutant synapses, suggesting that its selective degradation
is impaired. Functional synaptic defects observed at
mutant NMJs are consistent with a presynaptic defect
where docked vesicles of variable sizes compared to con-
trols are found. Indeed, the occurrence of giant miniature
720

 endplate potentials (GMEPPs) has been suggested to repre-
sent constitutive neurotransmitter release via endosome
structures at the synapse.84 The occurrence of GMEPPs,
together with increased MEPP frequency, is also observed
in synapses lacking SNAP25, which is misregulated in
Plaa mutant synapses.5
There is some evidence that a ubiquitin-based sorting
mechanism may operate within an endosome interme-
diate at synapses to regulate the molecular composition
and functionality of SV. Active zone proteins Bassoon

turnover,
including
SNAP25 and SV2, by restricting local activity of the E3
ligase SIAH1. Depletion of these components in hippo-
campal neurons leads to increased endolysosomal struc-
tures and accelerated degradation of SV components.85
In skywalker mutant flies, excessive endosomal SV recy-
cling and accelerated clearance of Ub-tagged SV proteins
leads to increased numbers of super-functional ‘‘rejuve-
nated’’ SVs.86,87 Too much activity results in neurodegen-
eration which can be rescued by mutating components
of the ESCRT87 or VPS C/HOPS complex,86 indicating
that enhanced targeting of SV cargos for lysosomal degra-
dation underlies the skywalker phenotype. Human ortho-
log TBC1D24 (MIM: 613577) is mutated in DOOR syn-
drome (MIM: 220500), where affected individuals have
early-development seizures and neurological involvement
including optic atrophy and MRI abnormalities.88,89 This
GTPase activating protein negatively regulates the SV-asso-
ciated RAB35, which associates with ESCRT-0 HRS in an ac-
tivity-dependent
manner
to
stimulate
endolysosomal
degradation of a subset of synaptic membrane proteins,
including SV2 and SNAP25.1,87 This suggests that turnover
of different SV proteins is differentially regulated and prob-
ably involves specific ubiquitin-adaptors (as well as Rabs).
Our study is the first ubiquitin adaptor protein to be
directly linked to this process. We propose that PLAA plays
a key role in recognizing Ub-modified, likely K63-modified,
SV components and targeting them for ESCRT-dependent
degradation via the MVB. The precise nature and kinetics
of the ubiquitin code being read on specific SV cargos dur-
ing vesicle recycling remains to be addressed: is it linkage
specific or do additional domains exist on modified cargos
that are read by adaptors like PLAA? Intriguingly, endoge-
nous mammalian PLAA was recently shown to bind multi-
ple ubiquitin chains, including K63 and K48 in a cell type-
dependent manner, possibly due to cell type-specific PTMs
or differentially expressed adaptor proteins.90 PLAA was
also found to bind to poorly characterized ubiquitin link-
ages K6, K11, and K29 whose roles in neural biology and
synaptic function are currently unknown. As improved
tools to study these atypical chains in vivo are developed,
the complexities of the ubiquitin code in neural biology
can be unpicked.
This study demonstrates a critical role for ubiquitin
signaling in synaptic function by directing turnover of
synaptic membrane proteins locally via the endolysosome.
Critically, from a therapeutic perspective better under-
standing of how ubiquitin signals regulate the fate of SV
cargo could lead to the development of small molecule
ubiquitin signaling modulators to enhance (in PLAAND-
affected individuals) or suppress (in DOOR-affected indi-
viduals) SV component turnover, rescuing synaptic func-
tion and minimizing neuronal loss.
