Heterochronic parabiosis rejuvenates the performance of old tissue stem cells at some
expense to the young, but whether this is through shared circulation or shared organs is
unclear. Here we show that heterochronic blood exchange between young and old
mice without sharing other organs, affects tissues within a few days, and leads to different
outcomes than heterochronic parabiosis. Investigating muscle, liver and brain hippocampus,
in the presence or absence of muscle injury, we find that, in many cases, the inhibitory effects
of old blood are more pronounced than the benefits of young, and that peripheral tissue injury
compounds the negative effects. We also explore mechanistic explanations, including the
role of B2M and TGF-beta. We conclude that, compared with heterochronic parabiosis,
heterochronic blood exchange in small animals is less invasive and enables better-controlled
studies with more immediate translation to therapies for humans.

echnological developments and progress in our under-
standing of disease have eliminated many previously
common sources of mortality. Along with our age shifting
demographic, however, a host of new debilitating age-associated
disorders have emerged. The medical costs of managing an
aging world poses significant economic and social challenges and
will ultimately require a long-term solution. One way to increase
healthy longevity would be to rejuvenate the regenerative and
repair capacity of aged tissues. Published work suggests restoring
the circulatory environment of aged tissues back to a productive,
young, composition may help to rapidly and broadly enhance
the maintenance and repair of multiple old organs, combat
degeneration and extend health span1–8.
The effects seen by heterochronic parabiosis, the surgical
joining of two animals of different ages, include rejuvenation of
multiple tissues in the old partner, and are often simplistically
assumed to be caused by the exchange of macromolecules
found in plasma, however, parabiosis is far more complex.
For example, old animals with young partners have, through the
shared circulation, continuous access to the young organs,
which regulate metabolic homeostasis, wound clearance and
inflammation, and provide blood oxygenation to the animals3,5.
Old
mice
attached
to
young
animals
also
benefit
from
environmental enrichment and youthful pheromones, which
may play a role in neuronal plasticity and neurogenesis9,10. The
young parabiont partially maintains an additional aged body
with deteriorating organs, chronic inflammation and skewed
immune responses. Additionally, young and old organ systems
have an opportunity to ‘adapt’ to prolonged sharing of circulatory
milieus and thus change their local influences on resident stem
cells. All of the above could contribute to the observed differences
in regenerative responses.
One
conclusion
from
recent
studies
on
heterochronic
parabiosis is that the regenerative capacity of old tissue stem
cells in all three germ layer derivatives can be enhanced by
the young systemic milieu3,4,11–13. It is tempting to assume
that young plasma has pro-regenerative factors, and indeed
administration of young plasma to aged mice improved their
cognition14. However, the effects of young blood plasma on stem
cells in brain or other tissues have not been studied, and it
remains to be discovered whether and which plasma factors
would be active enough to influence neurogenesis or cognition at
small doses when added to an aged circulation, and would be able
to cross the blood–brain barrier to have positive or negative
central effects. Thus far, only heterochronic parabiosis has been
shown to enhance myogenesis, hepatogenesis, bone regrowth,
neurogenesis, cognition and the numbers of dendritic spines in
old mice. Most importantly, the positive effects of heterochronic
parabiosis are robust for muscle, lesser for liver and marginal for
neurogenesis; and a significant inhibition of even young tissue
stem cells by the aged circulatory milieu takes place2,4,5,8,11,15.
In contrast to the permanent anastomosis of parabiosis, we
developed a blood exchange system where animals are connected
and disconnected at will, removing the influence of shared
organs, adaptation to being joined and so on. The effects of
heterochronic blood exchange were examined with respect to all
three
germ
layer
derivatives:
injured-regenerating
muscle,
ongoing liver cell proliferation and adiposity, and in the brain,
hippocampal neurogenesis, and this time in the presence versus
absence of muscle injury. Most surprisingly, the onset of the
influence of heterochronic blood exchange on myogenesis,
neurogenesis and hepatogenesis turned out to be within a few
days. Notably, the outcome of heterochronic blood exchange is
also different from heterochronic parabiosis, particularly for
neurogenesis where our results suggest that old blood is far more
inhibitory to tissue health than that young blood is rejuvenative,
and that peripheral tissue injury compounds the negative effects
of old blood on young neurogenesis. Heterochronic blood
exchange enhances old muscle repair without inhibition of
young, and old hepatogenesis is improved and fibrosis and
adiposity are decreased, while young hepatogenesis becomes
diminished. Moreover, our studies demonstrate a rapid increase
in beta-2 microglobulin (B2M) in young tissues by old blood; and
this phenotype is not from elevated circulating B2M in old mice
(as there is none), suggesting that another age-specific systemic
molecule raises B2M in the young organs. Blood exchange in
small animals enables well-controlled studies with more rapid
translation for therapy for humans.
Results
Blood exchange between mice. To develop a better-controlled
experimental system where only blood is exchanged, we devel-
oped a small animal blood exchange device, which operates
similarly to a previously published circulatory cell-scrubbing
device16. It consists of a computer controlled microfluidic
peristaltic pump circuit and computer controlled extracorporeal
blood
manipulation
system
(Supplementary
Fig.
1
and
Supplementary Movie 1). A major design constraint of small
animal blood manipulation that we have addressed is the low
volume of total blood that can be removed from a small animal at
once. It is not prudent to remove more than 10% of an animal’s
blood at once, and mice contain 5–8% (w/w) blood. This
translates to B150 ml of blood that can be removed from a 30 g
mouse. Small volume microfluidic blood manipulation systems
exist for lab on a chip and other diagnostic applications17,
however, our device is the first to allow for continuous blood flow
as required for larger scale experimental applications in live mice
(Supplementary Movie 1). In contrast to parabiosis, where joint
circulation is established in B7–10 days through growth of skin
capillaries, blood exchange is instantaneous and well controlled
by the device. The procedure is less invasive than parabiosis as it
does
not
involve
as
much
invasive
surgery,
only
the
catheterization of a jugular vein (Supplementary Fig. 1). The
exchanged blood is visualized in the tubing and the exchange
volumes are easily measured.
Using this small animal device we have exchanged blood
between 4 pairs of young to old mice, using 4 pairs of isochronic,
young to young exchanges and 4 pairs of isochronic, old to
old exchanges, as controls. Virtually 100% animal viability is
maintained when two series of 15 exchanges of 150 ml of
blood per series are performed over the course of 24 h,
establishing a blood equilibrium similar to parabiosis between
the pairs in a fraction of the time. This regiment was employed
for the studies and will be referred to as a single procedure of
blood exchange thereafter.
Young blood improves old muscle regeneration. One day after
the blood exchange, tibiallis anterior (TA) hind leg muscles
of all mice were injured by cardiotoxin (CTX) and 5 days
later this muscle, as well as non-injured livers and brains were
isolated postmortem. The efficiency of muscle regeneration was
determined in a manner identical to the heterochronic parabiosis
studies3,4. TA muscles were injected with CTX 1 (CTX, Sigma,
0.1 mg ml � 1).
Ten
micrometre
muscle
cryo-sections
were
prepared from TA muscle, which was isolated at 5 days post
CTX injury. These cryo-sections were analysed by haematoxylin
and eosin (H&E), staining and by eMyHC immuno-detection
followed by microscopy and quantification of the percent of de-
novo small eMyHC þ myofibers with centrally located nuclei that
robustly appear in young, but are less in the old injured muscle,
which typically shows more inflammation and incipient fibrosis.

 As shown in Fig. 1a–c, a single procedure of heterochronic blood
exchange significantly improved the regeneration of old muscle
after experimental injury (both when assayed by H&E staining or
eMyHC immunofluorescence), while there was no statistically
significant decline in the robust regeneration of the young
muscle. The numbers of de-novo myofibers were slightly higher
for all cohorts when counted by the more robust eMyHC
immunofluorescence method as compared with H&E, but the
relative differences between the YY, YO, OY and OO cohorts
remained virtually the same. We also examined de-novo fibre size
(minimal Feret diameter, as published6,18), as expected the
regenerating fibre size declined with age but interestingly was
increased in old mice transfused with young blood, while
remaining unchanged in young mice transfused with old blood
(Supplementary Fig. 2). Importantly, the degree of fibrosis
(a culprit of muscle aging) was also reduced by the young
blood exchange and was not increased in the young mice
transfused with old blood (Fig. 1d).
Old blood inhibits young performance. To assay functional
performance, the blood exchange studies were repeated without
muscle injury, and a four-limb hanging test was applied to the
isochronic and heterochronic cohorts 6 days after the blood
exchange (for example, the same time frame when muscle repair
was studied in the injured mice). In this test animal strength,

Figure 1 | Heterochronic blood exchange effects on muscle regeneration and performance. One day after blood exchange mice were injured by
intramuscular injections of CTX into TA. Five days after injury, TA muscles were isolated, cryo-sectioned and analysed. (a) TA muscles from young mice
receiving young blood (YY), young mice receiving old blood (YO), old mice receiving young blood (OY) and old mice receiving old blood (OO) were
analysed by haematoxylin and eosin (H&E) staining and immunofluorescence with anti-eMyHC antibody. Representative images show an injury site and
nascent de-novo formed eMyHC þ myofibers which are smaller in size with central nuclei than uninjured myofibers. Scale bar, 50 mm for H&E panel and
25 mm for immunofluorescence panel. (b,c) Regeneration indices ±s.e.m. were quantified from H&E images (b) and eMyHC images (c) by counting the
number of nascent de-novo formed myofibers and dividing by the total number of nuclei present at the injury/regeneration site. By H&E: *Po0.05 N ¼ 4

isochronically and heterochronically transfused mice that were not injured, before and at 6 days after the blood exchange. Maximal hanging time was

 endurance and learning are all measured: mice hang inverted from
a 1 cm mesh screen over soft bedding, and the time until the mouse
drops is recorded over three trials, and the maximal time
multiplied by the weight is expressed as hanging index19.
Interestingly, exchange with old blood markedly diminished the
maximal hanging index of young animals (3 out of 4 mice) but
there was no increase in this parameter for the old mice transfused
with young blood (Fig. 1e). Of note, the initial hanging indices in
training session were not significantly different between the young
and old mice, but young animals transfused with young blood
became statistically better than the old mice after the training
session, while young mice transfused with old blood remained
statistically undistinguishable from the old cohorts (Fig. 1e).
These data extrapolate the findings obtained with hetero-
chronic parabiosis4, and establish that the beneficial effects of
young blood for the regeneration of old muscle take place right
away and without the contribution of young organ systems or
altered activity levels between the isochronic and heterochronic
pairs. Moreover, while one exchange of young blood improves
muscle regeneration in old animals, it does not improve the
functional performance as measured by the hanging test, while in
young animals the functional performance declines very rapidly
after one exchange of old blood.
Hippocampal neurogenesis responds to old blood and injury.
The efficiency of hippocampal neurogenesis was determined
similarly to refs 8 and (ref. 3). Mouse brains were collected and
sectioned at 25mm using a cryostat. Sections were fixed in 4%
paraformaldehyde and immunostained with antibodies to Ki67,
using Hoechst co-stain to detect all nuclei. The numbers of Ki67þ
proliferating
subgranular
zone
(SGZ)
cells
were
quantified
throughout the entire dentate gyrus (DG) of the hippocampus, as
in ref. 8, where based on co-immunodetection of Sox-2, these
Ki67 þ SGZ cells are virtually all-neural stem cells. As shown in
Fig. 2 and Supplementary Fig. 3, based on either SGZ Ki67 þ or
SGZ Ki67 þ /Sox2 þ cell numbers, one exchange of heterochronic
blood severely decreased hippocampal neurogenesis in young mice,
and surprisingly, there was no significant positive effect in the old
mice that had been exchanged with young blood. Of note, these
were the same old animals that showed improvement in muscle
regeneration and hepatogenesis (see below).
In the some of published heterochronic parabiosis work, muscle
was injured in animals that were assayed for hippocampal
neurogenesis3,4 and similar effects on neurogenesis were later
seen in the absence of muscle injury11. We compared the influences
of heterochronic blood exchange on neurogenesis in the presence
and absence of muscle injury, to assay for potential changes in the
brain that might be caused by additional stress and peripheral
inflammation. While a statistically significant inhibition of young
neurogenesis by old blood persisted, its magnitude was less in the
absence of muscle injury (Fig. 2c). There was no enhancement of
old neurogenesis by the young blood, with or without muscle
injury (Fig. 2 and Supplementary Fig. 3). These data confirm the
negative effects of the old systemic milieu on neurogenesis in young
hippocampi and identify that such inhibition is very rapid and is
uncoupled from influences of old organ systems, pheromones and
changes in the environmental stimulation or exercise. Muscle
injury after blood exchange might add to the magnitude of the
negative effects of old blood on young neurogenesis, and even
without muscle injury, young hippocampal neurogenesis quickly
declines after one old blood exchange.
Liver responds to heterochronic blood and muscle injury. We
next assayed the efficiency of ongoing hepatogenesis in mice that
were and were not experimentally injured in their muscle, as in
ref. 4 by co-immunodetection of a proliferation marker, Ki67 and a
hepatocyte marker albumin, in 10mm liver cryosections. As shown
in Fig. 3a,b, the numbers of proliferating old hepatocytes were
increased after a single procedure of heterochronic blood exchange,
while the numbers of Ki67 þ albumin þ
young hepatocytes
declined on transfusion of old blood. The ongoing hepatogenesis in
animals that did not experience muscle injury was much less
prominent even in young mice, suggesting that hepatogenesis
increases during muscle repair, but still the heterochronic effects of
a single blood exchange were observed (Fig. 3a,b).
As previously reported4 there were many fibrotic areas in old
livers, which at times had proliferating clusters of small albumin
negative cells (Fig. 3c,d). Such areas were not present in young
livers, and very interestingly the numbers of these fibrotic
proliferative clusters declined in the livers of old animals that
were exchanged with young blood, regardless of whether muscle
was or was not injured (Fig. 3c,d).
As another metric for improvement in liver health we assayed
liver tissue adiposity by Oil Red staining on 10 mm cryosections from
the above-described animals. Old livers were markedly more positive
for Oil Red, as compared with young and interestingly, transfusion
with young blood somewhat reduced old liver adiposity, while there
was no significant increase in young liver adiposity (Fig. 3e,f and
Supplementary Fig. 4). These results demonstrate that heterochronic
blood
exchange
and
heterochronic
parabiosis
yield
similar
enhancement
of
old
hepatogenesis
and
decline
of
young
hepatogenesis; and suggest that muscle damage enhances ongoing
hepatogenesis in young mice. Additionally, the fibrotic regions and
adiposity rapidly decline in old livers after the exposure to young
blood. Such effects manifest after just a single procedure of blood
exchange and in the absence of the influences from heterochronic
organ systems.
B2M and TGF-beta as mechanisms are tissue specific. To start
looking into the molecular mechanisms that are responsible for
these rapid influences of circulation on tissue repair and
maintenance, we studied the levels of B2M. B2M is the invariant
chain of MHC class I that becomes elevated with inflammation
and based on current reports is over-pronounced in old muscle
and brain, as compared with young8,14,20. B2M levels were
assayed by immunofluorescence in tissue cryosections (Fig. 4a,b)
and by western blotting (Supplementary Fig. 5) in the young and
old mice that underwent isochronic versus heterochronic blood
exchange as described above. For tissues derived from mice
injured with CTX in their TAs, the immunofluorescence on
muscle and brain tissue cryosections demonstrated that exchange
with old blood rapidly (within 6 days), elevated the B2M levels in
young muscle located outside of the CTX injury, and in the SGZ
of the young hippocampus, (Fig. 4a,b). Interestingly, the B2M
remained high in the old hippocampi of the heterochronically
exchanged animals (Fig. 4a,b). Furthermore, for muscle these
age-specific differences in B2M were less pronounced between YY
and YO cohorts and were undetectable between the OO
and OY cohorts when immunofluorescence was performed at
the sites of CTX injury—muscle regeneration (Supplementary
Fig. 5) in agreement with the previous findings that inflammation
overlaps in space and time with muscle repair and that some
degree of transient inflammation is needed for successful
myogenesis7,21.
Western blotting confirmed the results obtained by the
immunofluorescence and demonstrated that B2M levels were
increased with age in muscle and in brains, while there was no
detectable age-specific increase of B2M in livers (Supplementary
Fig. 5 and Supplementary Fig. 9). The regional tissue differences
in B2M levels are not resolvable by the western analyses, thus the

 differences between the cohorts were less drastic, but in general
agreement with those seen by the immunofluorescence.
The age-elevated increase of B2M was less noticeable

was again no detectable age-specific change (Supplementary
Fig. 5). By immunofluorescence, the regional (DG) age-
specific difference in B2M persisted in brains of young
versus old mice that did not experience muscle injury;
and no significant modulation of B2M were detected between
YY versus YO or OO versus OY cohorts (Supplementary
Fig. 5).

Figure 2 | Heterochronic blood exchange reduces the proliferative potential of old neural stem cells. The effects of isochronic and heterochronic blood
exchange on SGZ neurogenesis were determined in animals from Fig. 1, with and without muscle injury. (a) Brains from YY, YO, OY and OO mice that had
muscle injury were frozen and sectioned at 25 mm. Cryo-sections were immunostained for the proliferation marker Ki67 (red) and counterstained for nuclei
(Hoechst, blue). Shown are representative images of the dentate gyrus (DG). Scale bar, 100 mm. (b) Proliferating (Ki67 þ /Hoechst þ ) cells in SGZ were

with the isochronic young controls. At the same time, there in no enhancement of SGZ cell proliferation occurring in heterochronic old brains as compared

diminished with age and significantly decreased after exposure of young cells to old blood by a single procedure of exchange. Notably, neurogenesis was
significantly attenuated in YO mice with muscle injury as compared with the uninjured animals of the same cohort (P ¼ 0.001). No significant positive
effects on old Ki67 þ /Sox2 þ /Hoechst þ cells were detected with or without muscle injury. n ¼ 4, *Po0.05, **Po0.005.

 The simplest explanation to these changes in tissue B2M would
be an age-imposed increase in circulating B2M, which was
suggested by the earlier reports8,14,20. Thus, we performed B2M
western blotting analysis for circulating B2M in five young and five
old blood serum samples. Interestingly, while there was a mild
trend (B10%) for the age-specific increase in systemic B2M, it was
without statistical significance (Fig. 4c). And similar results were
obtained with and without muscle injury (Supplementary Fig. 6 and
Supplementary Fig. 9). Therefore, it is unlikely that systemic B2M
accumulates in young tissues after heterochronic exchange, because
there is no statistically significant age-imposed increase of B2M in
circulation, but rapid and significant changes in B2M manifest as
the result of heterochronic blood exchange and moreover, in
specific regions of muscle (outside of injury) and brain (DG).
Transforming growth factor beta1 (TGF- beta1) becomes up
regulated with age systemically and locally, and experimental
attenuation of the age-increased TGF-beta/pSmad3 reduces B2M in
muscle and brain1,8,22. However, while TGF-beta1 was expectedly
elevated with age (myostatin and follistatin remained similar), a
single procedure of heterochronic blood exchange did not
significantly change the TGF-beta1/pSmad3 intensity in either
young or old muscle (Supplementary Fig. 7). These data suggest
that other than TGF-beta1/pSmad3 determinant(s) must account
for the induction of B2M by old blood in young animals.

 These results demonstrate an age-specific increase of B2M in
muscle, brain, but not liver and blood serum, and establish that
exchange of young mice with old blood elevates B2M in muscle
and brain in a regional manner; however, no decline of B2M is
observed in hippocampi or the entire brain of old mice exchanged
with young blood. Moreover, the tissue increase of B2M after
heterochronic blood exchange does not seem to be caused by
age-elevated systemic B2M or TGF-beta1.
Discussion
Exchange transfusion is a routine strategy for the management
of several diseases, such as sickle cell disease, haemolytic disease
of newborns, some cases of severe malaria and so on23–25.

blood exchange to be performed in the mouse and other
small animals, thus allowing for well-controlled experimental
tests, which can be rapidly translated to combating a number of

using human-based exchange devices that are already FDA

blood, but B2M is not diminished in the old DG after young blood exchange. Shown are means±s.e.m. for all histograms.

 Importantly, our work on rodent blood exchange establishes
that blood age has virtually immediate effects on regeneration of
all three germ layer derivatives. Unlike with parabiosis (where
other organs are shared besides blood), the positive effects of
young blood benefit old muscle regeneration, while negative
effects of old blood dominate in young brain (hippocampus) with
liver being intermediate. The positive effects of young blood could
also be explained by dilution of old blood, and not necessarily by
young factors. These positive effects manifested on muscle and
liver even when no additional exchanges were performed, while
old animals kept producing their ageing factors for 6 days after
the blood exchange with young mice. For muscle, when tested at
5 days after injury, formation of new myofibers signifies
productive responses of the muscle stem cells (satellite cells) at
24 h after the injury (or earlier); hence the effects of blood
exchange must have been rapid. In future work it will be
interesting to establish if the long-term muscle tissue health
(innervation, vascularization and so on) and muscle physiology
also improve in old mice transfused with young blood, as here we
focused on the acute regenerative
outcome, for example,
formation of the new muscle fibres at the sites of experimental
injury. However, in support of currently used approach, the acute
5 days post injury regenerative outcome has been shown to
reliably
reflect
the
regulation,
aging
and
rejuvenation
of
myogenesis by parabiosis and by defined factors, which moreover
were found to be conserved between mice and human1–8.
Comparing neurogenesis in the absence and presence of
experimental muscle injury, we uncovered that neurogenesis
declines more severely in young mice exchanged with old blood
when peripheral tissue is injured. This could be due to many
mechanisms (inflammation being one), and our B2M data
supports
that
B2M
is
up-regulated
during
inflammation.
Importantly, these comparative studies have also demonstrated
that even in the absence of muscle injury there is no enhancement
of old neurogenesis by one exchange of young blood, and there is
still a decline in young neurogenesis after old blood exchange.
It is also interesting that a single procedure of heterochronic
blood exchange resulted in a strong inhibition of young
neurogenesis, even when young systemic and local factors were
produced for the remaining 6 days and the young mouse had a
chance to neutralize or remove the inhibitors of the old systemic
milieu. These effects reveal a dominant, rapid and lasting
age-specific influence of the systemic milieu on the regenerative
capacity of multiple tissues.
While these results are seemingly different from those obtained
by young plasma infusions into old mice, as mentioned
above, neurogenesis has not been tested in those previous
studies14, only cognitive performance which may be independent
of neurogenesis. Additionally, it remains possible that with
repeated infusions of young plasma some positive effects would
manifest
for
more
parameters
of
the
aged
brain.
When
interpreting the results of functional performance (four-limb
hanging test) it is more likely that lack of performance of the
young mice after blood exchange with old blood stems from a
cognitive decline in addition to diminished muscle strength and
endurance. Young and old mice had initially similar hanging
indices in the training session, and while the YY cohort
significantly enhanced its performance after training, the old
mice and the young mice transfused with old blood did not.
Additionally,
it
is
unlikely
that
muscle
strength
declined
dramatically in just 6 days without a detectable decrease in
muscle tissue health or regeneration (for example, by histology).
The four limb hang test requires coordination, endurance and
strength, which might diminish in mice by 2 years of age;
however, our old mice were robust and active (as per daily
observations of our scientists and University vets), thus a
complete lack of improvement in the four limb handing test is
not because animals were too frail physically. It is hence
surprising, given the reported improvement in Morris water
maze after infusions of young plasma (where not only learning
but
strength
and
coordination
and
also
vision
are
of
importance)11,14.
As mentioned, repeated infusions might have cumulative effect,
however, the volume of young systemic factors is B50% of the
total after blood exchange, as compared with 5–10% after
each plasma injection11, and old circulatory factors are removed
by exchange, but not in a plasma injection protocol. Of note,
there is a number of different tests for animal learning and
cognition and some of them, but not others might reveal the
improvement of old mice injected with young plasma or
transfused with young blood; this direction would be interesting
to pursue in future work.
We did not perform additional heterochronic parabiosis
studies in parallel with the heterochronic blood apheresis. There
might be slight differences in the regeneration indices and so on
phenotypes, not only between the individual experiments, but
also even between different pairs of animals in individual
heterochronic parabiotic pairings. However, as demonstrated by
others
and
us
repeatedly
over
the
past
decade1–8,
the
enhancement of old tissue regeneration and inhibition of young
tissue regeneration seen in heterochronic parabiosis has been
robustly reproducible validating a comparison of our new data.
Identification of the blood factor(s) that rapidly influence the
health of several tissues that we report here, and uncovering their
mechanism of action would certainly be a worthy future
endeavour. In this regard, the rapid, significant and tissue
regional increase in B2M on transfusion of young mice with old
blood could contribute to the cognitive, as well as neurogenic and
myogenic changes8,14,20. It is interesting that regeneration of
young muscle does not diminish after a transfusion of old
blood and the levels of B2M differ between the non-injured
and injured-regenerating regions of muscle; muscle regeneration
overlaps in space and time with inflammation and some
inflammatory
cytokines
are
positive
regulators
of
myoge-
nesis7,28,29.
This
might
explain
the
higher
tolerance
of injured muscle to old blood, as compared with the brain-
neurogenesis and diminished capacity to improve hanging test
performance after the training session. Similarly, while muscle
injury seems to enhance hepatogenesis, such an increase might be
physiologically important in young mice and its lack in old
animals might reflect a negative age-related decline that is quickly
restored by the young blood. The lack of age-specific changes in
B2M in livers is also interesting and further promotes the idea
that for tissues with high rate of regeneration, some inflammation
might be a positive factor.
Some of the broadly functioning inhibitory culprits of the aged
systemic and local niches of stem cells have been defined, for
example, TGF-beta1, osteopontin and the secretome of senescent
cells7,8,30,31. While it is unlikely that TGF-beta1 crosses the
blood–brain barrier (BBB) and heterochronic blood transfusion
does not significantly change TGF-beta 1 levels in muscle,
excessively high TGF-beta1 (as found locally in tissues and in
circulation in old mice and humans) can promote vascular
changes leading to the leakiness of the BBB, as well as inhibit
neurogenesis indirectly via inflammation and contribute to broad
(other than brain) tissue pathologies1–8. A positive factor that
diminishes with age systemically and is needed for muscle repair
and brain health has been identified: oxytocin—a peptide
hormone.

the

bone

(BMP),
oxytocin/MAPK, FGF/MAPK, Delta/Notch and so on cell-fate
regulatory age-specific pathways in the settings of heterochronic
exchange in future work. Since whole blood and not just plasma
were used in our system, it would be also interesting to separate
humeral and cellular influences of heterochronic blood exchange
in future embodiments of the device. Of note, little has been
reported of heterochronic bone marrow transplant effects on
multi-tissue regeneration, and that experimental system is quite
different from heterochronic blood exchange, as bone marrow
transplants require lethal whole-body irradiation followed by
long-term recovery of hosts.
In our experiments, it is not likely that old leucocytes crossed the
young blood–brain barrier to inhibit neurogenesis in just 6 days,
but positive effects of young leucocytes in wound healing and
negative peripheral effects of the aged leucocytes could play a role.
There was no time to develop persistent inflammation and no signs
of acute inflammation were observed in our experiments, when
analysing young muscle tissue histology by H&E after transfusion
with young or old blood. However, in old muscle inflammation is
typical (without and with transfusion); and inflammation could
also differ between different organs of the same animal. In future
studies, we plan to separate the effects of plasma from those of
leucocytes (by adding cell-removal module to our device). Finally,
from theoretical and clinical perspectives it will be interesting to
comprehensively delineate the onset and duration of the positive
and negative influences of the heterochronic systemic milieu on
regeneration of studied here and other tissues.
Small animal blood exchange and parabiosis are different in
many ways, including the timing of blood exchange, involvement of
the immune system (that is, parabiotic disease), participation of the
organ systems, environmental enrichment and pheromones and so
on; thus, it is not surprising that some of the effects on tissue
regeneration turned out to be different. However, interestingly
many of the effects are quite similar and take place rapidly after
the heterochronic blood exchange procedure. Summarily, current
work establishes a paradigm of the plasticity of age; the age of
tissues is acutely, rapidly, effectively reversed to younger or older
states, and unlike parabiosis, extracorporeal blood manipulation
provides a modality of rapid translation to human clinical
intervention.
Methods
Animals. All procedures were performed in accordance with the administrative
panel of the Office of Laboratory Animal Care, UC Berkeley and the protocol was
approved by the UC Berkeley Animal Care and Use Committee. Young male
C57BL/6 mice (2 months of age) were purchased from the Jackson Laboratory
(#00664). Twenty-two-month-old male C57BL/6 mice were purchased from the
National Institute on Ageing.
Blood exchange. Blood exchange in young animals was performed at 3 months of
age and in old animals at 23 months of age. The procedure was as follows: first a
jugular venous catheter was inserted in the right jugular vein as we did previously
using refinements by Bardelmeijer et al.16,36. Using a 10 ml Hamilton syringe 10 ml
of catheter locking solution containing 500 units per ml lithium heparin in 90%
glycerol and 10% phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) were introduced into the
catheter to prevent clot formation. The animals were allowed to heal from the
surgical procedure for 24 h and then they were immobilized with isoflurane
anaesthesia at a 1% concentration. The locking solution was removed from their
catheters and a bolus of PBS containing 0.5 units per ml lithium heparin was
administered IV at 100 units per kg and they were connected to our blood
exchange apparatus. Briefly, using our microfluidic blood exchange device 150 ml of
blood was transferred from one mouse to another 15 times with a 30 s delay
between blood administration and withdrawal twice within 24 h to yield a o90%
homogenization of blood between the two animals. We visualized the blood
coming from one animal and going into another (Supplementary Movie 1) and we
calculate that after a single exchange session the two animals blood is B90%
homogenized, and are able to programme precisely the degree of homogenization
we desire and confirm the volumes of exchanged blood in each experiment
(knowing the tubing diameter and length). The mice are weighed before the
exchanges and we calculate the volumes of exchanged blood based on fluid
dynamics as well as the outcome of many control experiments in which total
blood volume is correlated with animal weight.
Cardiotoxin muscle injury. Eight hours after the blood exchange procedure, mice
were injured by intramuscular injections of CTX (Sigma, 10 ml per muscle at
0.1 mg ml � 1) into the tibialis anterior (TA). Five days after the injury, TA muscles
were isolated.
Tissue isolation. Tissue isolation was performed postmortem and muscle, liver
and brain were snap frozen in isopentane ( � 70 �C), embedded frozen in tissue-tek
optimal cutting temperature (OCT, Sakura Finetek, The Netherlands).
Tissue sectioning. OCT embedded muscle and liver were sectioned using a
cryostat at 10 mm. Sagittal sections of brain hippocampi were similarly processed to
25 m sections. The respective tissue sections were then attached to positively
charged glass coverslip slides in preparation of H&E or immunohistochemistry
analysis.
H&E staining. Histological preparation for muscle sections was performed:
dehydration and removal of OCT in 70% ethanol for 3 min, dehydrated
at 95% ethanol, hydrated in deionized water for 1 min, haematoxylin for
5 min, 1X Scott’s water for 1 min, rinsed in water for 1 min, eosin for 4 min,
rinsed in water for 30 s, a dehydration series of 70%, 95% twice, 99 and
100% ethanol, for 1 min each. Sections were cleared with xylenes twice, 1 min
each. 2–3 drops of 50% resin/50% xylenes mounting medium were added to each
slide and glass cover slips were placed. Images of injury sites were obtained by light
microscopy.
Immunofluorescence. Primary antibodies were used at 0.5–1 mg ml � 1 and
sourced from Abcam: rabbit anti-Ki67 (ab16667, 1:200), and rabbit anti-pSmad3
(1:200); Fisher Scientific: rabbit anti-follistatin (PA519787, 1:200); Santa Cruz
Biotechnologies: anti-Sox2 (sc-17320 1:400); R&D Systems mouse anti-Albumin
(MAB1455, 1:1000), rabbit anti-myostatin (AF788, 1:200). Mouse hybridoma
anti-eMHC was prepared in house (F1.652 clone, Developmental Studies
Hybridoma Bank, University of Iowa, deposited by Blau, HM) and used at 1:50.,
Secondary fluorochrome conjugated antibodies were from Life Technologies:
goat anti-rabbit 546 (A11010, 1:2,000) and goat anti-mouse 488 (A11029, 1:2,000).
DNA was stained by Hoechst 33342 from Sigma Aldrich (B2261) used at
1 mg ml � 1. Negative controls with isotype-matched immunoglobulin G
(IgGs) were routinely performed for all immunodetection studies shown here and
above; and background non-specific immunofluorescence was minimal,
Supplementary Fig. 8.
Sections. Sections were prepared using the following methods: sections were
blocked in 1% staining buffer (1% calf serum in 1X phosphate saline buffer, PBS)
for 30 min on positively charged frosted glass microscope slides. Sections were then
incubated with primary antibodies overnight at 4 �C, washed three times in
staining buffer and secondary antibodies and Hoechst nuclear DNA were added for
2 h at room temperature, followed by 3 PBS washes, and mounting with
Fluoromount (Sigma F4680). Samples were imaged with a Zeiss Axioscope
fluorescent microscope. Samples stained for embryonic myosin heavy chain were
not fixed nor were they permeablized. For B2M, myostatin and follistatin, muscle
sections were fixed in 70% ethanol for 8–12 h at 4 �C and washed with 1 � PBS,
permeabilized with 0.1% Triton X-100 for 5 min at room temperature before
adding antibodies as above. TGF beta1 and pSmad 3 were stained with a protocol
identical to those of myostatin, follistatin, and B2M, only without any fixation.
Brain sections were fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde for 5 min. Sections were
permeablized by 0.1% Triton X-100. Liver sections were fixed with 70% ethanol,
permeablized by 0.1% Triton X-100.
Oil red staining. . Liver sections of 10 m were hydrated in 1 � PBS for B10 min.
The sections were then washed in 60% isopropanol for 3–5 min and later placed in
isopropanol-based Oil Red staining solution for 15 min. After, the sections were
washed in 60% isopropanol once more for 1 min. Nuclei on these sections were
stained after a 5-min wash in haematoxylin. The sections were finally washed in
deionized water for 1 min. Fluoromount was used as the mounting medium and
images were taken from these slides.
Western blotting. Tissue lysates were prepared using T-per tissue protein
extraction buffer (Thermo Fisher prod #78510) according to manufacture’s
protocol. Protein quantification was done using RED 660 protein assay
(Cat #786–676). Lysates and blood were diluted to 1 � Laemmli buffer, boiled for
5 min and 30 mg protein or 1 ml blood was separated on precast 4–20% TGX gels

PBS þ 0.1% Tween-20, 5% non-fat dry milk, incubated with overnight at 4 �C.
horseradish peroxidase (HRP)-conjugated secondary antibodies (goat anti-rabbit
IgG-HRP, Santa Cruz Biotechnology, sc-2004, 1:1,000, goat anti-mouse IgG-HRP,
Santa Cruz Biotechnology, sc-2055, 1:1,000) were diluted in PBS þ 0.1% Tween-20,
1% BSA and incubated for 1 h at room temperature. Blots were developed using
Western Bright ECL reagent (Avansta), and analysed with a Bio-Rad Gel
Doc/Chemi Doc Imaging System and Quantity One software. Results of
multiple assays were quantified using Image J software. Pixel Intensity of bands of
interest were normalized with pixel intensity of glyceraldehydes-3-phosphate
dehydrogenase or b-actin. Uncropped images of immunoblots are shown in
Supplementary Figs 9 and 10.
Four limb hanging test. Muscle strength and endurance were determined
by timing how long mice can hang upside down from a wire screen, as
published19. Briefly, each mouse was placed on a 1 cm. mesh, 1 mm wire
screen, 30 cm over soft bedding, inverted and timed until the mouse fell.
Each animal was given two to three trials with at least a 5 min rest between
trials. Hanging index is expressed as the maximum hang time times the weight of
the mouse, with longer times or greater weight for a given time considered
better performance.
Data quantification. Muscle regeneration indices were calculated by counting
percent de-novo myofibers with central nuclei to total nuclei in 3–4 representative
images of 10-m muscle sections for each blood exchange cohort. Muscle fibrosis was
quantified by measuring fibrotic areas in arbitrary units on Image J. These fibrotic
areas were normalized to the area of the image taken at � 20 (B1,4000 mm2).
Neurogenesis was quantified by counting the number of Ki67 þ /Hoechst þ cells in
175 micrometre (from multiple 25 micrometre sections) of the SGZ each blood
exchange cohort and extrapolated to the total thickness of the DG. Sox2 þ /Ki67 þ
cells were quantified by counting the number of these cells per 25 mm section, one
section per noted cohort. Counting cell numbers from multiple 10-mm sections of
each blood exchange cohort did quantification of hepatocyte proliferation, for
example, Ki67 þ , albumin þ , and Hoechst þ cells and of albumin- Ki67 þ fibrotic
cells. Oil Red quantification was done by obtaining the total area of the red fatty
droplets as a percentage of the entire � 20 image area used, using a consistent
color-threshold function in software ImageJ. B2M in muscle, liver and brain was
quantified by measuring areas of fluorescence in the images on Image J (identical
areas were applied to each image). Measured in arbitrary units, the area for muscle
spanned the entire image, the area measured in brain was B2 in the DG, and the
area measured in liver was 8. The fluorescence densities were corrected by sub-
tracting respective background IgG fluorescence.
Statistics. A non-paired, two-tailed t-test in Microsoft Excel was performed on all
of the respective data. P values of 0.05 or less were considered statistically
significant.
