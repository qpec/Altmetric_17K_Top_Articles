AIM
Studies have linked the use of inhaled corticosteroids (ICSs) to excess pneumonia risk in chronic obstructive pulmonary disease
patients. The risk in asthma patients remains unclear. The objective of the present study was to examine the risk of pneumonia
with ICSs in asthma patients aged 12–35 years.
METHODS
We formed a cohort of asthma patients treated from 1990 to 2007 using Quebec health insurance databases. Subjects were
considered currently exposed if they had had an ICS dispensed within the 60 days prior to their pneumonia index event or
matched person-moment. Secondary analyses investigated the risk of pneumonia according to ICS dose and type. Rate ratios
(RRs) and rate differences (RDs) were both estimated through a quasi-cohort approach.
RESULTS
The cohort included 152 412 subjects, of whom 1928 had a pneumonia event during follow-up. There was an increased risk of
pneumonia associated with current use of ICSs [RR 1.83; 95% confidence interval (CI) 1.57, 2.14] or an excess risk of 1.44 cases
per 1000 person-years (RD 1.44; 95% CI 1.03, 1.85). There was an excess pneumonia risk with low doses (RR 1.60; 95% CI 1.06,
2.45), moderate doses (RR 1.53; 95% CI 1.12, 2.08) and high doses (RR 1.96; 95% CI 1.64, 2.34) of ICSs, and with budesonide
(RR 2.67; 95% CI 2.05, 3.49) and fluticasone (RR 1.93; 95% CI 1.58, 2.36), specifically relative to no use. When accounting for
potential protopathic bias, the risk with current use of ICSs was attenuated (RR 1.48; 95% CI 1.22, 1.78).
CONCLUSION
ICS use in asthma patients appears to be associated with an increased risk of pneumonia and is present for both budesonide and
fluticasone.

Introduction
Inhaled corticosteroids (ICSs) are the first-line treatment for
patients with persistent asthma. ICSs have been shown to
have a good
efficacy and safety profile [3]. However,
complications have been found to be linked to ICS use,
including a reduction in bone density, ocular hypertension,
skin bruising, diabetes onset and progression, suppression
of growth in children and decreased immunity [4–7].
Furthermore, the Towards a Revolution in COPD Health
(TORCH) trial [8], as well as several large observational
studies,
found
an
excess
pneumonia
risk
in
chronic
obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) patients treated with
ICSs [9, 10].
While
the
increase
in
the
risk
of
pneumonia
in
association with ICS use in COPD patients seems clear, the
risk in asthma patients remains contentious. In a meta-
analysis of randomized controlled trials involving asthma
patients
using
budesonide
or
budesonide/formoterol,
O0Byrne et al. [11] found a significant decrease in the hazard
ratio
(HR)
of
pneumonia
adverse
events,
and
an
inconclusive effect on pneumonia severe adverse events.
However, Zhang et al. [12] found an almost four-fold
increase in Streptococcus pneumoniae upper respiratory tract
colonization in children using ICSs. In a case–control study
with 6857 cases of pneumonia or lower respiratory tract
infection
(LRTI)
among
subjects
with
asthma
aged
18–80 years, McKeever et al. [13] found an increased risk
with ICS use, especially at higher doses. As a result of these
contradictory findings, we conducted a population-based
cohort study of treated patients with asthma to assess
whether ICS use is associated with an increased risk of
pneumonia,
and
to
evaluate
whether
the
risk
varied
according to the dose and type of ICS.
Methods
Source of data
The source population was identified from the administrative
health databases of the Régie de l’assurance maladie du
Québec (RAMQ). This database captures the physician visits,
procedures, hospitalizations and demographics for the entire
population of the province, consisting of more than 7 million
people. The provincial pharmacy claims databases are also
included in the RAMQ database, consisting of approximately
42% of the entire Quebec population. This is because the
public insurance is available only to people over the age of
65, people without access to a private plan, welfare recipients
and children of persons covered by the public plan [14, 15].
As
a
result,
the
people
of
highest
income
may
be
underrepresented in this database, as they tend to have
private plans; nevertheless, the RAMQ still includes a large
number of people of average socioeconomic status [16].
Furthermore, the RAMQ databases have previously been used
extensively to conduct epidemiological studies of the risk and
benefits of ICSs [7, 9, 10, 17–21], and have been proven valid
and comprehensive [22–24].
Study design
The source population for the present study consisted of all
subjects with at least one prescription for a respiratory
medication between 1 January 1990 and 31 December 2007.
These
included:
any
form
of
β-agonist,
theophylline,
ipratropium bromide, tiotropium, sodium cromoglycate,
nedocromil, ketotifen, leukotriene antagonists or ICSs. The
study population of patients with asthma was formed by
restricting the cohort to subjects aged 12–35 years at cohort
entry, to stand the best chance of eliminating COPD patients,
C. J. Qian et al.
2078
Br J Clin Pharmacol (2017) 83 2077–2086
 as there is often overlap in diagnoses between asthma and
COPD among older subjects [25]. Subjects with any mention
of COPD prior to cohort entry were also excluded. To ensure a
new-user cohort, cohort entry was defined as the date of
dispensing of the first prescription, with at least 12 months
of no prior respiratory medication use. All subjects in the
cohort
were
followed
up
from
cohort
entry
to
first
hospitalization for pneumonia, death, end of RAMQ drug
coverage or 31 December 2007, whichever came first.
A population-based quasi-cohort approach was used to
allow better representation of the underlying cohort used
for the nested case–control analysis [26]. All outcome events
were selected, along with their exposure classification at the
time of the event. The outcome events were defined as a first
hospitalization with a diagnosis of pneumonia of any cause
identified
in
the
RAMQ
hospitalization
database
[International Classification of Diseases, Ninth Revision
(ICD-9) codes 480–487.0 inclusive; ICD 10 codes J10.0,
J11.0,
J12-J18]
during
the
cohort
follow-up.
These
hospitalizations include any admissions or deaths due to
pneumonia, as well as those with primary or secondary
diagnoses
of
pneumonia.
The
dates
of
these
hospital
admissions were defined as the index pneumonia person-
moment (all events and exposures are examined for each
person on each day). These outcome events were matched
to 10 event-free person-days based on age (±1 year), cohort
entry (±1 month) and follow-up (±1 month). When fewer
than 10 event-free person-days were available, all available
index person-moments were used to match to the outcome
index person-moment.
All prescriptions for ICSs, alone or in a combination
inhaler, dispensed between the cohort entry date and the
index person-moment, were identified. Formulations of ICSs
were
noted
to
allow
classification
into
subgroups
of
budesonide,
fluticasone
and
others,
consisting
of
beclomethasone dipropionate, ciclesonide and mometasone.
The estimation of equivalent amount of doses was based on
the Canadian asthma consensus report, as well as the
National Asthma Education Expert Panel report 2 [27, 28].
Accordingly,
the
equivalent
doses
for
ICSs
are
beclomethasone 100 μg, budesonide 80 μg, triamcinolone
200 μg, fluticasone 50 μg and flunisolide 200 μg. The
converted doses for each subject are classified into categories
of high (fluticasone ≥500 μg day–1), moderate (fluticasone
250–499 μg day–1) and low (fluticasone <250 μg day–1) [27].
Data analysis
Both crude quasi-rate ratios (RRs) as well as crude and
adjusted
quasi-rate
differences
(RDs)
of
pneumonia
associated with ICS use were estimated using methods
proposed by Suissa [26]. Adjusted quasi-RRs with 95%
confidence interval (CIs) were estimated by conditional
logistic regression to account for matching. Covariates
adjusted for included age (matched by design), gender,
severity of disease and other comorbidity associated with a
risk
of
pneumonia.
Severity
of
disease
was
assessed
independently of ICS use, via the number of other respiratory
medications prescribed and the number of hospitalizations
related to asthma in the prior year. For oral corticosteroids,
only use within the last 3 months was considered as this
would be an indication of severe asthma or recent asthma
exacerbation, and would thus be critical to the risk of
pneumonia. We also excluded antibiotic prescriptions in
the 30 days prior to the index pneumonia event or matched
person-moment as it could represent initial therapy for
pneumonia. Other conditions correlated to the risk of
pneumonia
were
measured
based
on
prescriptions
for
conditions of interest which may cause immune system
depression or loss of mobility. These included medications
prescribed
for
diabetes
(insulin
or
oral
hypoglycaemic
agents),
cardiovascular
diseases
(cardiotropic
drugs,
antihypertensive agents, diuretics or vasodilators), central
nervous
system
conditions
(benzodiazepines,
major
tranquillizers, anticonvulsants or drugs for parkinsonism)
and
rheumatic
diseases
(gold
salts,
methotrexate,
azathioprine, hydroxychloroquine or chloroquine). Use of
non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs, antidepressants and
narcotics were also adjusted for.
Subjects were considered current users of ICSs if they had
a prescription dispensed within the 60 days prior to the
pneumonia index event or matched person-moment, and
non-users otherwise. The primary analysis assessed the risk
of pneumonia with all ICS use. Secondary analyses assessed
differences in risk by formulation and dose of ICS. Exposed
users
were
further
classified
into
users
of
fluticasone,
budesonide or others, and each ICS dose was further classified
into
high,
moderate
and
low
using
their
fluticasone-
equivalent dosage. All analyses were carried out with non-
exposed subjects as the reference group.
Sensitivity analyses were undertaken first to explore
possible misclassification of the outcome due to misdiagnosis
of pneumonia, by including only hospitalizations with a
primary diagnosis of pneumonia, or death from pneumonia
while
in
hospital.
Secondly,
we
included
an
analysis
exploring possible protopathic bias [29], a scenario where it
may have been possible that a patient was only prescribed a
respiratory medication upon early signs or symptoms of
pneumonia which may have been misinterpreted as asthma.
In the present analysis, we excluded the last 15 days
immediately prior to the pneumonia index event or matched
person-moment.
In
other
words,
a
subject
was
only
considered to be exposed to ICSs if their prescription had
taken place between 60 and 16 days, inclusive, prior to the
pneumonia
or
matching
person-moment.
Thirdly,
we
separated the non-users of ICSs into past- and never users,
defined as having a prescription in the 61–365 days prior to
the pneumonia index event or matched person-moment
and not having a prescription within the year prior to the
event or matching person-moment, respectively. To ensure
that we were comparing current users of ICSs to non-ICS users
who were being actively treated for asthma, we created a
comparison group consisting of subjects currently using
other respiratory medication in the 60 days prior to the event
or matching person-moment. Respiratory medications other
than ICSs included any form of β-agonist, theophylline,
ipratropium bromide, tiotropium, sodium cromoglycate,
nedocromil,
ketotifen
or
leukotriene
antagonists.
This
analysis was also repeated accounting for protopathic bias
by not considering the last 15 days of therapy prior to the
pneumonia index event or matched person-moment. In a
similar vein, in order to ensure that all subjects had actively

 treated asthma at cohort entry, we included a sensitivity
analysis where cohort members were more strictly defined
as having had three respiratory medication prescriptions
including ICSs, on at least two occasions, over the span of
1 year. All analyses were conducted using SAS V.9.4 (Cary,
NC). We obtained ethics approval for the study from the
Research Ethics Committee of the Jewish General Hospital,
Montreal, Quebec, Canada.
Results
A
total
of
1 410 169
patients
dispensed
a
respiratory
medication were identified between 1 January 1990 and
31 December 2007. After excluding patients outside the
age
range
of
12–35
years,
prevalent
users
and
those
without enough information in the database, the study
cohort consisted of 152 412 subjects (Figure 1). This study
cohort was followed up for an average of 4.8 years; subjects
were, on average, 24.2 years old at cohort entry and 34.9%
were male.
A total of 1928 patients with the outcome of pneumonia
hospitalization were then identified. These included all
diagnosis
entries
for
pneumonia,
including
primary,
secondary, admission and death. The quasi-cohort consisted
of 19 275 person-days (10-to-one matching with one patient
having only five control person-moments), selected by
incidence density random sampling from a total of 267.3
million person-days of follow-up in the full study cohort.
Table 1 shows the baseline characteristics of the quasi-cohort
by exposure. The non-users of ICSs were slightly older and
there were fewer males at cohort entry: 30.8 years old and
29.8% male, as opposed to 30.4 years of age and 31.0% male
in users of ICSs. In addition, the ICS users had a higher
prevalence of markers of asthma severity, and the non-users
had a higher prevalence of other comorbidity.
Table 2 shows that, after adjustment for differences in
covariates, current ICS use was associated with an 83%
increase in the rate of pneumonia hospitalization (RR 1.83;
95% CI 1.57, 2.14), or an excess risk of 1.44 cases per 1000
person-years (RD 1.44; 95% CI 1.03, 1.85). Again, using
non-users as the reference group, low-dose ICS was found
to be associated with a 60% increase in risk (RR 1.60; 95%
CI 1.06, 2.45); moderate dose ICS was associated with a
53% increase in risk (RR 1.53; 95% CI 1.12, 2.08); and
high-dose ICS was associated with a 96% increase in risk
(RR 1.96; 95% CI 1.64, 2.34). The risk of pneumonia was
also found to be increased with use of budesonide by 2.67
times (RR 2.67; 95% CI 2.05, 3.49), and fluticasone by 1.93
times (RR 1.93; 95% CI 1.58, 2.36), while the other ICS
group yielded a nonstatistically significant increase (RR
1.23; 95% CI 0.92, 1.63).
Sensitivity analyses
All results from sensitivity analyses included in the study are
shown in Table 3. By excluding subjects with pneumonia as a
secondary hospitalization diagnosis, current ICS exposure
was found to be associated with a 91% increase in the rate
of pneumonia (RR 1.91; 95% CI 1.56, 2.33). Moderate and
high doses of ICS were also associated with an excess risk, as
well as all types of ICS.
When accounting for potential protopathic bias by
excluding the last 15 days of medication use, exposure
to ICSs was found to be still associated with a 48%
increased
risk
of
pneumonia
(RR
1.48;
95%
CI
1.22,
1.78),
and
high
doses,
budesonide
and
fluticasone
remained associated with an increased, but attenuated risk
of pneumonia.

 By further classifying the non-users of ICSs into past
and never users, current use was found to be associated
with a similar higher risk (RR 1.88; 95% CI 1.60, 2.20),
and past use with a nonsignificant risk (RR 1.12; 95% CI
0.96, 1.30).
When only including as non-users of ICSs subjects
currently using other respiratory medications, current use
of ICSs was found to be associated with a smaller but
nevertheless significant increase in risk (RR 1.61; 95% CI
1.38, 1.89). By further excluding the last 15 days prior to
the index person-moment, with non-users currently using
other respiratory medications as the reference group, the
risk of pneumonia remained with current use of ICSs,
although the effect was more modest (RR 1.32; 95% CI
1.09, 1.60).
Finally, by limiting the study to subjects with three or
more prescriptions for respiratory medications at cohort
entry, the results were similar, showing an increase in risk
with current use of ICSs, albeit with wider confidence
intervals due to the smaller cohort size (578 subjects with
a total of 5747 person-days); RR 1.74; 95% CI 1.37, 2.21.
Figure 2 summarizes the RR estimates of all sensitivity
analyses as compared with the primary analysis using a
forest plot.
Discussion
In a large cohort of over 150 000 patients treated with
asthma medications, we found that current ICS use is
associated with a significant 83% increase in the risk of
being hospitalized for pneumonia. This risk was greatest
with higher doses, with the dispensing of 500 μg or more
of fluticasone-equivalent per day being associated with a
96% increase. This risk remained significant with lower
doses of ICSs. This risk was also found to be significant in
relation to the use both of budesonide (167% increase in
risk) and fluticasone (93% increase in risk). While the risk
appears to be greater with budesonide, the confidence
intervals overlap, such that we could not conclude that
there is a difference in risk between these two agents. With
the quasi-cohort approach, we were also able to estimate
rate differences, allowing conclusions to be made on the
absolute scale. Per 1000 person-years, the overall use of ICSs
was
found
to
be
associated
with
1.44
extra
cases
of
hospitalized pneumonia. When considering the possibility
that prescriptions for an ICS near a pneumonia event might
actually be due to early signs of pneumonia (protopathic
bias),
and
when
restricting
the
comparison
group
to
subjects with more active treatment for respiratory disease,
the risk of pneumonia with current use of ICSs remained
but was attenuated at 32% (95% CI of 9%, 60%). The results
of these sensitivity analyses addressing confounding by
indication as well as protopathic bias are likely to be more
representative of the true magnitude of the effect of ICSs
on pneumonia risk in asthma patients with similar levels
of severity.
Overall, our findings disagreed with the conclusions of
the only other study published that directly assessed this
relationship; O’Byrne et al. [11] found an HR of 0.52 (95%

 CI 0.36, 0.76) for pneumonia as an adverse event, and 1.29
(95% CI 0.53, 3.12) for pneumonia as a serious adverse event.
This discrepancy may be due to the fact that the study by
O’Byrne et al. obtained outcome data from clinical trials,
where pneumonia was recorded as a secondary outcome. This
means that these cases are likely to have been milder than
those in our study, where our outcome definition was
hospitalization for pneumonia. In addition, because patients
in clinical trials are more closely monitored, they may be
healthier and have better-controlled asthma, putting them
at lower risk of being hospitalized for pneumonia. A recent
meta-analysis
of
clinical
trials
found
a
lower
risk
of
pneumonia with ICSs, although withdrawals were highly
imbalanced between groups [30]. Furthermore, the benefit
was no longer significant when excluding the largest trial
which included as pneumonia events outcomes such as
mucus plugging and atelectasis that may be benefitted by
the use of ICSs [30].
However, our findings were comparable with those of
other
observational
studies
that
have
alluded
to
this
relationship [30]. For example, Zhang et al.’s [12] cross-
sectional study in children found a large and significant
increase in the risk of oropharyngeal colonization with
S. pneumoniae in asthmatic children associated with ICS use,
and,
while
colonization
does
not
necessarily
lead
to
pneumonia, it is likely to increase the risk, especially as
S.
pneumoniae
remains
a
common
cause
of
bacterial
pneumonia in children and adults [31]. The case–control
study by McKeever et al. [13] also found that ICS use is
associated with an increase in the risk of pneumonia as well
as LRTIs. Furthermore, the latter study found a dose–response
relationship in the 18–40-year-old population, where the
results suggested that the risks are higher with higher doses.
Similarly, an increased risk in pneumonia associated with
ICS use was also found in COPD studies using RAMQ
databases [9, 10]. While ICSs are not expected to have the
same efficacy and safety profile in COPD patients as in
asthma
patients,
the
association
between
ICSs
and
pneumonia in COPD patients may be instructive. In these
studies, the overall increase in the risk of pneumonia
hospitalization was found to be approximately 70%, which
is comparable with the risk we found in the present analysis.
While COPD patients are more likely to acquire pneumonia
as the result of a higher likelihood of lower-airway bacterial
colonization [32, 33], the relative risk between ICS users and
non-users in COPD and in asthma patients appears to be
comparable.
However, the findings of an association between the risk
of pneumonia and the different ICSs do not agree with
those of previous studies. While previous studies generally
found fluticasone to be associated with a higher risk [13,
34], our results showed that budesonide and fluticasone
are both similarly associated with a significant increase in
the risk of pneumonia. However, in the McKeever et al.
study [13], only fluticasone was found to be associated with
a significant increase in the risk of pneumonia and LRTI in
the 18–40-year-old population [13]. In addition, in the
COPD case–control study by Suissa et al. [10], budesonide
was found to be associated with a lower, but still significant
17% increase in risk (95% CI 1.09, 1.26), while fluticasone
had a much higher increase in risk (RR 2.01; 95% CI 1.93,
2.10). Other COPD studies included in the Kew et al. [34]
meta-analysis also showed fluticasone to be associated with
an
overall
higher
risk
of
pneumonia.

 pathophysiological differences between asthma and COPD
may have contributed to this discrepancy, it is likely that
our different outcomes of interest also led to different
results.
While
we
included
all
hospitalizations
with
pneumonia diagnoses as the outcome of interest, the
McKeever et al. study [13] also included LRTI as the
outcome, and the COPD studies included in the Kew et al.
meta-analyses [34] were all randomized controlled trials
where the cases of pneumonia were principally milder.
The present study had both strengths and limitations.
Using the number of prescriptions for all classes of asthma
medications, and asthma hospitalizations present in the year
prior to index person-moment, as well as pneumonia
hospitalizations and oral corticosteroids use prior to cohort
entry, we were able to adjust for both the severity of asthma
and other comorbidities, both of which can bias the
relationship between ICS use and pneumonia as an outcome.
The
possibility
of
residual
confounding
arising
from
unmeasured factors remains a concern. For example, in the
present study, had the data been available, smoking and other
environmental exposures would have been important factors
to consider.

Inhaled corticosteroids and risk of pneumonia in patients with asthma

 Similarly, due to the nature of the study, pneumonia
outcomes were identified based on diagnosis codes and
not
confirmed
through
further
clinical
testing.
It
is
therefore possible that these cases of pneumonia were in
fact
episodes
of
misdiagnosed
asthma
exacerbation.
However, this is unlikely to have explained our results, as
previous studies have shown that regular ICS use decreases
the risk of asthma exacerbations [35–37]. Furthermore,
previous studies have generally shown that the use of
database hospital codes in identifying pneumonia outcomes
is valid and accurate [38–40]. Patients with asthma in the
present
study
were
identified
based
on
only
one
prescription of respiratory medication. It is likely that some
included subjects may not have had asthma, and were only
medicated for a temporary condition, would be less likely to
receive ICSs and would inherently be at lower risk of
pneumonia than patients with true asthma [41]. Such a bias
should have been minimized by adjusting for the number
of prescriptions for respiratory medications and asthma
hospitalizations
in
the
past
year.
Furthermore,
the
association persisted after restricting the analysis to patients
more likely to have active asthma. Restricting our study to
subjects under the age of 35 years will have minimized the
inclusion of patients with COPD.
Other
strengths
of
the
study
stem
from
our
consideration of potential protopathic bias. By excluding
the 15 days prior to the index person-moment, we were
able to provide
results
that may better represent the
magnitude
of
the
relationship
between
ICSs
and
pneumonia in the asthmatic population. In addition, by
further classifying the non-users into past and never users,
we were able further to understand the duration of the
effect that ICSs would have had on the risk of pneumonia.
As was shown in the sensitivity analysis, only current users
of
ICSs
show
a
significant
increase
in
the
risk
of
pneumonia. Lastly, by using the quasi-cohort approach,
we were able not only to represent better the relationship
between users and non-users, but also to estimate the risk
difference, thus allowing a better representation of the risk
on the absolute scale. This can facilitate physicians and
decision makers better to understand the magnitude of
the impact of the association.
In conclusion, the present study showed that the risk of
pneumonia – in particular, serious pneumonia leading to
hospitalization – in asthma patients is indeed elevated in
relation to ICS use. Both budesonide and fluticasone are
associated with a statistically significant increase in the risk
of pneumonia. Interestingly, while the conclusions of our
study are generally consistent with those of the previous
literature, our study further suggests that the risk profile of
budesonide is in fact similar to that of fluticasone. However,
provided that it is ensured that only patients actively
treated for asthma are included, and that the use of ICSs is
not in fact a marker for early signs of pneumonia, the
increase in risk is relatively small. In future studies, it would
be helpful further to validate the diagnosis of pneumonia,
identify subjects with a confirmed diagnosis of asthma and
adjust for smoking.
