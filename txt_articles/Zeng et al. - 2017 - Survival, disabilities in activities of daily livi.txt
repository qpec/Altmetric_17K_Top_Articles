and cognitive functioning among the oldest-old in China: 
a cohort study 
Yi Zeng, Qiushi Feng, Therese Hesketh, Kaare Christensen, James W Vaupel
Summary
Background The oldest-old (those aged ≥80 years) are the most rapidly growing age group globally, and are most in 
need of health care and assistance. We aimed to assess changes in mortality, disability in activities of daily living, and 
physical and cognitive functioning among oldest-old individuals between 1998 and 2008.
Methods We used data from the Chinese Longitudinal Healthy Longevity Study. Three pairs of cohorts aged 
80–89 years, 90–99 years, and 100–105 years (in total, 19 528 oldest-old participants) were examined; the two cohorts 
in each pair were born 10 years apart, with the same age at the time of the assessment in the 1998 and 2008 surveys. 
Four health outcomes were investigated: annual death rate, Activities of Daily Living (ADL), physical performance in 
three tests and cognitive function measured by Mini-Mental State Examination (MMSE). We used different tests and 
multivariate regression analyses to examine the cohort differences. 
Findings Controlling for various confounding factors, we noted that annual mortality among oldest-old individuals 
was substantially reduced between 0·2% and 1·3% in 1998–2008 compared with individuals of the same age born 
10 years previously, and that disability according to activities of daily living had significantly reduced annually between 
0·8% and 2·8%. However, cognitive impairment in the later cohorts increased annually between 0·7% and 2·2% and 
objective physical performance capacity (standing up from a chair, picking up a book from the floor, and turning 
around 360°) decreased anually between 0·4% and 3·8%. We also noted that female mortality was substantially lower 
than male mortality among the oldest-old, but that women’s functional capacities in activities of daily living, cognition, 
and physical performance were worse than their male counterparts.
Interpretation Advances in medications, lifestyle, and socioeconomics might compress activities of daily living 
disability, that is, benefits of success, but lifespan extension might expand disability of physical and cognitive 
functioning as more frail, elderly individuals survive with health problems, that is, costs of success.

Introduction
Population aging is one of the major challenges facing 
most countries in the world, including China. The 
accompanied dramatic increase in numbers of the oldest-
old (individuals older than 80 years) is of particular 
concern, presenting a major challenge for health and 
social care systems, because the oldest-old often need 
daily assistance and medical care.1 Two contrasting 
scenarios of health trends in aging populations have 
been proposed. One view states that advances in medical 
technology, improvements in lifestyle, and socioeconomic 
development will postpone the onset of disability and 
chronic diseases among the elderly, so that morbidity will 
be compressed in old age.2–4 This concept is linked to the 
benefits of success—ie, that people are living longer 
(success) and in better health at older ages than they 
were previously (benefits). By contrast, in the alternative 
scenario, reduced mortality is hypothesised to result in 
an increased number of frail elderly people surviving 
with health problems, thus worsening the overall health 
of the elderly population. This concept is often referred 
to as expansion of morbidity,5,6 closely linked to that of 
costs of success, which specifically means that people’s 
lifespans are lengthening (success) but with worse health 
at older ages than previously (costs). In reality, these 
two trends might coexist and interplay,7 and the concept 
of dynamic equilibrium has been introduced to help 
understand the association between morbidity and 
increasing life expectancy.8
Trends in the overall health status of the elderly 
population are generally positive in high-income 
societies.9 However, several reports support the opposite 
trend for some major health indicators. For example, 
findings from a Swedish study showed that the objective 
function tests of physical capacity, lung function, and 
cognition were significantly worse in 2002 compared 
with 1992 in individuals older than 77 years.10 Although 
dementia incidence has fallen in some European 
countries11 and the USA,12 findings from nine large 
Japanese studies13 have suggested that prevalence of all-
cause dementia and Alzheimer’s disease are increasing 
in Japan. Investigators building on the work of several

studies (including two nationally representative surveys) 
reported opposing trends of improvement in disability 
measures, alongside an expansion of morbidity in 
chronic diseases and functional impairments, among 
Swedish oldest-old.10,14
Several studies have reported that the prevalence of 
disability according to activities of daily living among 
Chinese elderly people has decreased in the past two 
decades.15,16 However, Wu and colleagues17 concluded that 
dementia prevalence among elderly individuals aged 
70 years or older was generally increasing, on the basis of 
an evaluation of 70 prevalence studies of dementia in 
mainland China, Hong Kong, and Taiwan from 1980 to 
2012.17 Similarly, Chan and colleagues18 reported that the 
prevalence of all forms of dementia at ages 65–69 years 
and 95–99 years in China in 2010 had increased by 44·4% 
and 43·7%, respectively, compared with 1990.18
The existing scientific literature provides empirical 
support for both compression and expansion of 
morbidity, but little research so far has investigated the 
mixed effects of these two opposing trends in a 
single study with a sufficient sample size of the oldest-
old. The exception is a Danish study of a cohort born in 
1905 and assessed at age 93 in 1998, compared with a 
later cohort born in 1915 and assessed at age 95 in 2010.19 
This study provided some support for the mixed effects 
of both compression of morbidity and expansion of 
morbidity. However, whether these mixed effects 
also exist among the oldest-old in low-income or 
middle-income countries such as China is unclear. We 
aimed to address this research question by comparatively 
analysing cohorts of the oldest-old born in 1909–18 
versus 1919–28 (aged 80–89 years in 1998 vs 2008), born 
in 1899–1908 versus 1909–18 (aged 90–99 years in 
1998 vs 2008), and born in 1893–98 versus 1903–08 (aged 
100–105 years in 1998 vs 2008). To our knowledge, this 
study is the first to assess this important issue in a low-
income or middle-income country, and uses the largest 
dataset of oldest-old cohorts in the world. 
Methods
Study design and participants
This study draws on data from the oldest-old participants 
(ie, those aged 80–105 years) from the 1998 and 2008 
waves of the Chinese Longitudinal Healthy Longevity 
Surveys (CLHLS). The CLHLS is a nationwide survey 
done in a randomly selected half of the counties and cities 
in 22 of the 31 provinces, covering about 85% of the total 
population of China. The CLHLS attempted to interview 
all centenarians who voluntarily agreed to participate in 
the study in the sampled counties and cities. The CLHLS 
also adopted a targeted random-sample design to 
ensure representativeness, through interviews with 
approximately equal numbers of male and female 
nonagenarians, octogenarians, and young-old (aged 
65–79 years) living near to the centenarians (ie, in the 
same village or street, if available, or in the same sampled 
county or city). This design serves well our aim of 
Research in context
Evidence before this study
We used PubMed, Web of Science, and Google Scholar to search 
for publications before Aug 30, 2016 in English. The Chinese 
literature was identified through searches of the Wan Fan 
database search engine and the Knowledge Network search 
engine. We used the search terms “oldest-old”, “old age”, 
“mortality”, “ADL”, “cognitive function”, “physical 
performance”, and “cohort differences”, etc. We also checked 
the reference lists of the related publications identified in the 
search. Existing scientific literature has provided empirical 
support for both compression of morbidity (including disability 
and chronic diseases) and expansion of morbidity as human 
longevity increases. However, no research so far has 
investigated the mixed effects of these two opposing trends in 
a single study with a large enough sample size of the oldest-old 
cohorts, except one study of Danish cohorts.
Added value of this study
Our findings support that, with increased longevity (success), 
there are co-existence and mixed effects of compression of 
disability in activities of daily living (benefits of success) and 
expansion of disability in physical and cognitive functioning 
(costs of success), which is in general consistent with findings 
from the Danish study that compared one pair of cohorts 
born 10 years apart aged 93 or 95 years in 1998 or 2010, with 
a total sample size of 5430 nonagenarians. However, we also 
noted important differences. The novelty of this study is that 
we compare three groups of Chinese cohorts born 10 years 
apart aged 80–89 years, 90–99 years, and 100–105 years at 
the time of the surveys in 1998 or 2008, with a total sample 
of 19 528 oldest-old participants. To our knowledge, this 
study is the first investigation of this important issue based 
on the largest dataset of oldest-old cohorts in the world and 
from a low-income or middle-income country.
Implications of all the available evidence
The combination of declining mortality with worsening 
cognition and physical performance among the rapidly growing 
population of oldest-old individuals has clear policy 
implications for health systems and social care, not only in 
China but also globally. Many more state-subsidised public and 
private programmes and enterprises are urgently needed to 
provide services to meet the various needs of the rapidly 
growing elderly population, especially the oldest-old. 
Additionally, programmes to prevent chronic disease in elderly 
people through individualised health interventions need to be 
prioritised.

investigating determinants of healthy longevity of 
different age and sex groups who live in the same social 
and natural environment.20
The Research Ethics Committees of Peking University 
and Duke University granted approval for the Protection 
of Human Subjects for the Chinese Longitudinal Healthy 
Longevity Survey, including collection of the data used 
for present study. The survey respondents gave informed 
consent before participation.
Procedures
The CLHLS was initially designed to facilitate 
international comparative analyses, and its questionnaire 
was translated from the instruments of the Danish 
longevity 
survey 
analysed 
by 
Christensen 
and 
colleagues.19 The instruments were adapted to the 
Chinese culture and socioeconomic context. A wide 
variety of international and domestic studies have 
confirmed that age reporting of the Han Chinese oldest-
old is in general reasonably accurate, due to the cultural 
tradition of memorising one’s date of birth to determine 
dates of important life events such as engagement and 
marriage.21,22
The CLHLS 1998 and 2008 surveys used almost exactly 
the same ascertainment and assessment protocols. No 
proxy was used for objective questions such as 
assessment 
of 
cognitive 
function 
and 
physical 
performance. The survey was administered in the 
participants’ homes by trained interviewers from the 
local centres for disease prevention and control for 
university students. More details about CLHLS, including 
sampling design, follow-up interviews with surviving 
participants and deceased participants’ close family 
members, data quality, and the variables analysed are 
described in the appendix.
Statistical analyses
We divided individuals into oldest-old born in 1909–18 
versus 1919–28 (aged 80–89 years in 1998 vs 2008), born 
in 1899–1908 versus 1909–18 (aged 90–99 years in 
1998– 2008), and born in 1893–98 versus 1903–08 (aged 
100–105 years in 1998 vs 2008).
We compared annual mortality, self-reported disability 
according to the activities of daily living scale, physical 
performance in three tests, and cognitive function 
measured by Mini Mental State Examination scores for 
men and women separately and for both sexes combined. 
We did standard statistical χ² tests (one-sided) or Z tests 
(two-sided) for categorical data, and t tests (two-sided) for 
continuous data. We also did multivariate regression 
analyses to explore the changes in mortality, physical 
function, and cognitive function between the oldest-old 
cohorts born 10 years apart, adjusted for the covariates of 
age, rural or urban residence, marital status, and 
education, which are the major demographic and 
socioeconomic factors affecting the mortality and health 
of elderly people in China. We based the mortality 
analysis on parametric survival models with Weibull 
distribution, while the Weibull assumption was satisfied. 
All other analyses were based on logistic regression 
models 
or 
linear 
regression 
models. 
We 
used 
STATA version 13.1 for the statistical analyses.
Role of funding source
The study funders provided financial support for data 
collection and analysis, but had no role in the writing of 
the report, interpretation of the results, or submission 
for consideration of publication. The corresponding 
author had full access to all the data in the study and had 
final responsibility for the decision to submit for 
publication.
Results
We included 19 528 individuals in our study, comprising 
7288 
octogenarians, 
7234 
nonagenarians, 
and 
5006 centenarians, interviewed in 1998 and 2008 (in view 
of the very high mortality at advanced ages, only  2·8% of 
the oldest-old participants were interviewed in both 1998 
and 2008 surveys). The appendix presents the basic 
demographic characteristics of the cohorts. Tables 1–3 
present the detailed results of cross-cohort changes in 
physical and cognitive function and death during follow-
up for men, women, and both sexes combined. 
Figures 1, 2 and table 4 present the summary results.
Age-specific and sex-specific mortality among Chinese 
oldest-old aged 80–89 years, 90–99 years, and 100–105 years 
were all reduced in the later cohorts compared with the 
cohorts born 10 years earlier (figure 1; tables 1–3). All of 
the nine sets of comparisons of age-specific mortality 
between the different cohorts of the oldest-old showed 
reductions of –0·2% to –1·3% in annual mortality during 
follow-up (table 4). Adjusted for covariates of age, sex, 
education, and rural or urban residence, the cross-cohort 
reduction in age-specific and sex-specific mortality was 
statistically significant in sex-combined centenarians 
(p=0·0032) 
and 
female 
centenarians 
(p=0·0163), 
and not significant in sex-combined octogenarians and 
nonagenarians, male or female octogenarians, male or 
female nonagenarians, or male centenarians (tables 1–3).
Disability as measured through activities of daily living 
of the Chinese oldest-old was significantly reduced in 
the later cohorts compared with the earlier cohorts 
(figure 1, tables 1–3). All of the nine sets of comparisons 
between different cohorts of the oldest-old showed 
substantial reductions in annual rates of disability, 
ranging from –0·8% to –2·8% (table 4). Adjusted for the 
covariates, the cross-cohort reductions in the mean score 
of activities of daily living disability were statistically 
significant 
(p<0·0001) 
for 
nonagenarians 
and 
centenarians (both sexes combined) and female 
nonagenarians and centenarians, significant (ranging 
from 
p=0·0023 
to 
p=0·0082) 
in 
sex-combined 
octogenarians and male nonagenarians, significant 
(ranging from p=0·0257 to p=0·0290) in female and

Data are mean (SD) or n (%). The mean annual death rates, mean ADL disability scores, mean  physical performance scores and mean MMSE scores are weighted averages using age-sex-residence (rural or urban)-specific sample weights as described in 
the appendix. Tests for annual death rates are based on parametric survival model with Weibull distribution; all other tests are based on logistic regression models or linear regression models.  ADL=activities of daily living. MMSE=Mini-Mental State 
Examination. *Multivariate model tests of the difference between the cohorts of men or women are adjusted for age, education, rural or urban residence, and marital status; in the tests for “Both sexes combined”, gender is also adjusted for. †Test of 
equal mean. ‡Test of equal proportions.

male octogenarians, and not significant in male 
centenarians (p=0·0604; tables 1–3).
The scores in objective physical performance tests 
(standing up from a chair, picking up a book from the 
floor, and turning-around 360° among the Chinese oldest-
old were all significantly worsened in the later cohorts 
compared with the earlier cohorts (figure 2, tables 1–3). 
All of the 27 sets of comparisons of physical performance 
tests between different cohorts of the oldest-old showed 
substantial 
reductions 
in 
annual 
rates, 
from 
–0·4% to –3·8% (table 4). Adjusted for the covariates, the 
cross-cohort differences in objective physical performance 
were highly significant in octogenarians, nonagenarians, 
and centenarians for men, women, and both sexes 
combined (p<0·0001) in 22 comparisons, ranging from 
p=0·0004 to p=0·0064 in four comparisons, and p=0·0184 
in one comparison; tables 1–3).
The cognitive function measured by the Mini-Mental 
State Examination test scores of the Chinese oldest-old was 
significantly worse in the later cohorts compared with the 
earlier cohorts (figure 2, tables 1–3). All of the nine sets of 
comparisons of cognitive function between different 
cohorts of the oldest-old showed significant reductions in 
annual rates, ranging from –0·7% to –2·2% (table 4). 
Adjusted for the covariates, the cross-cohort differences in 
cognitive functional scores were statistically significant 
(p<0·0001) in all of the nine comparisons for octogenarians, 
nonagenarians, and centenarians, for both sexes and for 
men and women separately (tables 1–3).
Tables 1–3 show male–female comparisons of the 
six pairs of oldest-old cohorts aged 80–89 years, 
90–99 years, and 100–105 years in 1998 and 2008; men 
had substantially and consistently higher age-specific 
mortality than did women, but substantially better health 
status in terms of ADL disability, physical performance 
test scores, and cognitive function. The sex differences in 
the 48 male–female comparisons were statistically 
significant (mostly p<0·001), except six non-significant 
comparisons in octogenarians and one non-significant 
comparison in centenarians.
Self-reported life satisfaction and self-reported good 
health significantly declined among the later oldest-
old cohorts compared with the earlier oldest-old cohorts 
(appendix; p<0·0001), except self-reported health in 
centenarians. Of note, the period cross-sectional 
comparisons showed that average self-reported life 
satisfaction and health slightly increased or remained 
almost the same from ages 80–89 years to 90–99 years 
and 100 years or older in both the 1998 and 2008 surveys 
(appendix), whereas scores for disability as measured by 
activities of daily living, cognitive function, and physical 
performance were all largely increased with increased 
age (appendix).
Discussion
In this cohort study we compared three groups of 
Chinese individuals born 10 years apart, aged 80–89 years, 
90–99 years, or 100–105 years at the time of surveys done 
in 1998 or 2008. To our knowledge, this study is the first 
to assess this important issue in a low-income or middle-
income country, and uses the largest dataset of oldest-old 
cohorts in the world. Our findings are generally 
consistent with those from the Danish study that 
compared a pair of cohorts born 10 years apart and 
aged 93 or 95 in 1998 or 2010.19 However, we also noted 
important differences.
Findings from both our Chinese study and the Danish 
study showed that mortality and disability (as defined by 
activities of daily living) among the later cohorts of the 
oldest-old were substantially reduced compared with the 
cohorts born 10 years earlier. However, the objective 
scores for physical performance (standing up from a

chair, picking up a book from the floor, and turning 
around 360°) for the Chinese oldest-old were all 
significantly worse in the later cohorts compared with the 
earlier cohorts. This observation is mostly consistent with 
the general pattern in the Danish study. Compared with 
the earlier cohort, the Danish later cohort had substantially 
worse ability to stand up from a chair or walk for 3 m 
among women and for both sexes combined.19
Both this study and the Danish study showed 
apparently contradictory findings with respect to survival 
and self-reported activities of daily living versus objective 
physical 
performance 
tests. 
We 
believe 
that 
two underlying factors might help to understand this 
effect. The first is the mixed effects of the two opposing 
processes of compression of morbidity (ie, benefits of 
success) and expansion of morbidity (ie, costs of success). 
On one hand, the later cohorts might benefit from 
progress in effective disease treatment, healthier 
lifestyles, declining disability effects of some major 
chronic diseases (eg, stroke and cardiometabolic 
disease),15 and improved standards of living due to rapid 
socioeconomic development in China. These benefits of 
success imply that the later cohorts of oldest-old 
individuals show reduced mortality due to postponement 
of senescence, and have reached older ages with 
improved health and functional capacity in daily living.4 
On the other hand, as compared with the earlier cohort, 
the 
later 
cohort 
includes 
more 
members 
who 
have survived life-threatening conditions (because of 
improvements in medical care and increased longevity), 
but they might be in relatively poor health, implying that 
the saving of lives might reduce overall physical 
functional capacity and health.19 We propose to use the 
term “costs of success” to describe this effect.
The second underlying factor is associated with 
different types of disability measurements. Disability as 
measured by self-reported activities of daily living 
depends not only on health status, but also on facilities to 
assist such activities (eg, transferring, using the toilet, 
and bathing). The substantial improvement of activities 
of daily living among the Chinese oldest-old could be 
partly due to the rapid changes in living standards and 
availability of facilities for daily life during the past few 
decades in China. For example, average annual 
disposable income among urban and rural households 
in 2008 was 3·0 times higher (urban) and 2·2 times 
higher (rural) than in 1998.23 Such rapid improvements 
in living standards that provide better facilities for daily 
life could help to explain the significant decreases in 
disability associated with activities of daily living. 
However, the objective tests of physical performance do 
not depend on facilities. Furthermore, self-reported 
activities of daily living are subject to substantially higher 
measurement errors compared with objectively-tested 
cognitive function and physical performance.24 Thus, 
disability scores based on self-reported activities of daily 
living might not be an accurate indicator of physical 
health status, although it can be used as a good 
measurement of assistance needs in daily living activities. 
The objective tests of physical performance have added 
predictive value beyond the self-reported measures of 
disability in evaluation of actual health status changes 
and decision making about health interventions.25
Cognitive function among the Chinese oldest-old was 
substantially and significantly worse in the later oldest-
old cohorts compared with the earlier cohorts, consistent 
with the trends reported in the other studies in mainland 
China, Hong Kong, and Taiwan.17,18 However, the Danish

differences in education. For the two sexes combined, the 
weighted average education levels of the three Chinese 
later cohorts born in 1903–08, 1909–18, or 1919–28 were 
significantly lower than that of the three corresponding 
cohorts born 10 years earlier, adjusted for age, sex, rural 
or urban residence, and marital status. The weighted 
average proportion of frequently going to bed hungry as a 
child (retrospectively self-reported) among the later 
cohorts was 30·5% higher than in the earlier cohorts. 
Such cross-cohort differences in educational attainment 
and childhood conditions probably resulted from the 
increase in domestic wars during the periods when the 
later cohorts were children, compared with the earlier 
cohorts. This finding implies that the poorer education, 
childhood 
conditions, 
and 
subsequent 
adult 
socioeconomic status experienced by the later cohorts 
contributed to their lower cognitive function score, as 
shown in other studies using the CLHLS data.26 This 
effect was in addition to the costs of success effects, which 
resulted in some frail elderly individuals being saved 
from dying but surviving with poor cognitive function. 
However, the average education level in the Danish 
1915 cohort was significantly better than in the 1905 cohort 
(p=0·006). Because higher education level is strongly 
associated with improved cognitive function in old age,27 
the positive effects of increased education level in the 
Danish later cohort might surpass the negative effects of 
the costs of success on cognitive function.
We observed that the magnitude of the difference in 
changes of physical and cognitive functions between the 
later and earlier oldest-old cohorts was substantially 
larger in our Chinese study than in the Danish study. For 
example, the difference in annual rates of changes in 
disability of activities of daily living between the later and 
earlier cohorts among Chinese nonagenarians was 2·3%, 
by contrast with the 1·1% reported for the Danish 
nonagenarian cohorts. Such differences in magnitude of 
changes are understandable, because China is still 
undergoing rapid health transition and socioeconomic 
development, whereas Denmark passed this stage a few 
decades ago.
Understandably, self-reported life satisfaction and good 
health substantially fell among the Chinese oldest-old 
cohorts interviewed in 2008 compared with the oldest-old 
cohorts interviewed in 1998 (appendix), because the later 
cohorts had significantly worse scores for physical 
performance and cognitive function and their expectancy 
for good life and health was higher with increased living 
standards. By contrast with the Chinese results, the 
opposite trend was observed in the Danish cohorts where 
the fraction of individuals with excellent self-reported 
health increased substantially (unpublished data). 
The 
period 
cross-sectional 
comparisons 
among 
difference age groups interviewed in the same year 
(2008) showed that the scores measuring capacities of 
self-reported activities of daily living, objective physical 
performance, and cognitive function decreased largely

Annual rates of changes presented in this table are estimated based on comparing the mean annual death rates, mean ADL disability scores, mean  physical performance scores and mean MMSE scores between the earlier and later cohorts at the 
same age in the two survey timepoints of 10 years apart; p-values are taken from tables 1–3; they are the results of multivariate model tests of the difference between the earlier and later cohorts, adjusted for age, education, rural or urban residence, 
and marital status; when the two sexes were combined, the gender was also adjusted for. ADL=activities of daily living. MMSE=Mini-Mental State Examination.

from ages 80–89 years to 100 years or older, but the 
proportion of the oldest-old individuals reporting 
satisfaction and good health slightly increased or 
remained 
almost 
unchanged 
across 
these 
ages 
(appendix). This finding is consistent with research 
about optimism and survival in the Danish 1905 cohort,28 
and three Danish population-based surveys (including 
11 307 participants aged ≥45 years, of whom 2411 were 
90 years or older), which demonstrated that decline in 
activities of daily living and cognitive function did not 
necessarily affect happiness at older ages.29 Our findings 
in the Chinese setting and the Danish findings might 
suggest that being more positive in one’s outlook on life 
(ie, optimism and happiness) could increase the chance 
of longevity.
Our study has important limitations and further 
research is needed. For example, additional in-depth 
studies are warranted to develop a deeper understanding 
of the mechanisms and causalities of how and why 
mortality and activities ofdaily living disability risk 
significantly declined due to benefits of success, whereas 
the objective tests of physical performance and cognitive 
function were significantly reduced due to the effects of 
costs of success. We did not investigate trends in the 
prevalence of clinically diagnosed chronic diseases (an 
important aspect of morbidity) between the earlier and 
later cohorts, and we did not make comparisons for the 
representative samples of young-old cohorts born 
10 years apart because of insufficient data (appendix). 
Further studies need to extend our analysis to cover all 
elderly age groups and include chronic diseases to fully 
understand the process of healthy aging in a lifecourse 
perspective, with a sufficiently large sample size of both 
oldest-old and young-old cohorts. In-depth research into 
the trends between various health outcome indicators 
might provide solid evidence for health intervention 
programmes aimed at strengthening the positive effects 
of the benefits of success and reducing the negative 
effects of the costs of success. This research would 
fundamentally contribute to the sustainable development 
of human societies in the face of worldwide rapid 
population aging with increased longevity.
Populations in China and many other countries in the 
world are aging rapidly. The oldest-old will increase much 
faster than any other age groups. The findings of the 
present study and other research10,13,14,17–19,30 provide a clear 
warning message to societies with aging populations, 
namely that although individuals enjoy increasing 
longevity and improvement in some health indicators 
(benefits of success), other major health indicators can 
deteriorate (costs of success). This effect poses enormous 
challenges for health systems, social care, and families, 
not only in China but also globally, especially in other low-
income and middle-income countries. The situation calls 
for policy actions. Thus, we believe that, to fully harvest 
the benefits and reduce the costs of the success from 
increasing lifespans, it is crucially important to develop
