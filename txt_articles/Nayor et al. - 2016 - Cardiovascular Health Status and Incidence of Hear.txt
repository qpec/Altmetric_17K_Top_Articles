t is estimated that almost 6 million Americans are currently 
living with heart failure (HF), a number that is projected to 
exceed 8 million by 2030.1 As a result of the high prevalence 
and substantial morbidity and mortality associated with HF, 
the financial burden to the healthcare system is enormous, with 
an estimated annual cost of $31 billion in the United States.1 
Accordingly, preventing HF is integral to improving popula-
tion health and reducing financial costs, which is reflected by 
the emphasis on prevention in recent HF practice guidelines.2,3
See Clinical Perspective
The primary modifiable risk factors for HF include high 
blood pressure (BP), diabetes mellitus, obesity, and smok-
ing.4,5 Recently, investigators from the Physicians Health 
Study I and Women’s Health Initiative have also demon-
strated associations of lifestyle factors, including healthy 
diet, physical activity, and moderate alcohol intake with a 
reduced incidence of HF in the community.6,7 Cardiovascular 
risk factors and unhealthy behaviors have been theorized to 
contribute to HF pathogenesis by promoting atherosclerotic 
vascular disease, myocardial infarction (MI), and adverse 
structural remodeling. These changes in cardiac structure 
and function, corresponding to stage B of the American 
Heart Association (AHA)/American College of Cardiology 
HF Stages, are best characterized by increases in left ven-
tricular (LV) mass (LVM), left atrial dimension (LAD), and 
LV geometric patterns indicative of adverse remodeling (ie, 
concentric remodeling, concentric and eccentric hypertro-
phy). Each of the aforementioned echocardiographic traits 
and LV geometry patterns has been related to incident HF in 
community-based cohorts.8–11
In 2010, the AHA announced the goals of improving car-
diovascular health (CVH) by 20%, and reducing deaths from 
cardiovascular disease (CVD) and stroke by 20% by the year 
2020.12 To achieve these objectives, the AHA has promoted 
a set of 7 behaviors and risk factor values (Life’s Simple 7),

Background—The 
American Heart 
Association Cardiovascular Health (CVH) score is inversely associated with cardiovascular 
disease, but its relations to cardiac remodeling traits and heart failure (HF) incidence have not been examined.
Methods and Results—A 14-point score was constructed for each participant based on the presence of poor, intermediate, or 
ideal status on each of the 7 CVH metrics (ideal score=14). We related the CVH score to echocardiographic traits cross-
sectionally and to HF incidence prospectively in the Framingham Offspring Study. In age- and sex-adjusted models, a 
higher CVH score was associated with lower left ventricular (LV) mass, LV wall thickness, LV diastolic dimension, and 
left atrial dimension (P<0.01 for all; n=2392; mean age, 58 years; 56% women), and with a 12% to 15% lower odds of 
prevalent LV concentric remodeling and concentric hypertrophy, respectively (P<0.0001 for both). On follow-up (mean, 
12.3 years), 188 incident HF events were observed in 3201 participants (mean age, 59 years; 53% women). In age- and 
sex-adjusted Cox proportional hazard models, the CVH score was inversely associated with HF incidence (hazard ratio 
per 1-point higher CVH score, 0.77; 95% confidence interval, 0.72–0.83). This association was partially attenuated upon 
adjustment for LV mass and interim myocardial infarction (hazard ratio, 0.84; 95% confidence interval, 0.76–0.93), and 
it was consistent for HF with preserved and reduced ejection fractions.
Conclusions—In our community-based sample, comprised predominantly of middle-aged white individuals of European 
descent, better CVH was associated with lower HF incidence, in part due to a lower prevalence of adverse cardiac 
remodeling.  (Circ Heart Fail. 2016;9:e002416. DOI: 10.1161/CIRCHEARTFAILURE.115.002416.)

including abstinence from smoking, ideal body mass index 
(BMI), regular physical activity, healthy diet, low untreated 
serum total cholesterol concentrations, optimal BP, and 
absence of diabetes mellitus.12 Together, these components 
comprise CVH, which is inversely associated with the risk of 
CVD and overall mortality in multiple reports.13–16 However, 
the relationship between CVH and HF has not been system-
atically assessed. We therefore hypothesized that CVH is 
inversely associated with the risk of incident HF, and that this 
association is partly attributable to the inverse association of 
CVH with the prevalence of adverse cardiac remodeling.
Methods
Study Sample
The descriptions of the history, design, and methodology of the 
Framingham Offspring Study (FOS) have been reported elsewhere.17 
For this investigation, 3532 FOS participants attending the sixth ex-
amination cycle (1995–1998) were considered for inclusion, and 2 
distinct samples were evaluated for analysis of echocardiographic 
traits and incidence of HF, respectively, as detailed below. At the 
sixth examination cycle (referred to as baseline for the present inves-
tigation), all attendees underwent a medical history, anthropometry, 
a cardiovascular-targeted physical examination, electrocardiography, 
echocardiography, and phlebotomy for measurement of standard car-
diovascular risk factors at the Framingham Heart Study (FHS) clinic. 
Of 3532 attendees, we initially excluded participants for serum cre-
atinine concentration ≥2 mg/dL (n=15), BMI <18.5 kg/m2 (n=62), 
missing components of the CVH score (n=219), or outlier laboratory 
values (n=1), yielding a base sample of 3235 participants. To evalu-
ate the association between CVH and echocardiographic indices of 
cardiac remodeling, additional exclusions were made from the base 
sample for missing echocardiographic measurements (n=843), result-
ing in a sample of 2392 participants (sample 1). For evaluating the as-
sociation between CVH and incident HF, we excluded from the base 
sample people with prevalent HF (n=30) and nonavailable follow-up 
time (n=4), resulting in a sample of 3201 participants (sample 2); this 
sample was larger because availability of echocardiographic mea-
surements was not required for relating CVH score to incident HF. 
The Boston University Medical Center Institutional Review Board 
approved all study protocols. Written informed consent was provided 
by all participants.
AHA CVH Score
A CVH score was constructed for each participant by assigning a 
score of 0 (poor status), 1 (intermediate status), or 2 (ideal status) for 
each of the 7 metrics of CVH (Table I in the Data Supplement). The 
CVH score was obtained by summing these values and it can thus 
vary from a minimum of 0 (consistent with poor CVH) to a maximum 
of 14 (indicating ideal CVH). Resting BP, BMI, cholesterol, fasting 
blood glucose, and self-reported smoking status were measured at the 
FHS clinic. The physical activity index was calculated as the sum of 
the reported time spent performing specific physical activities during 
a 24-hour period as previously described.16,18 The highest quartile of 
this index was used to define ideal physical activity, and values higher 
than the median but less than the top quartile were used to define 
intermediate status. Dietary quality was assessed using a food fre-
quency questionnaire (Table I in the Data Supplement). In agreement 
with previous investigations, a score of ≥2 was considered to be ideal 
status, 1 was considered intermediate status, and 0 was considered 
poor status.14,19
Echocardiographic Measurements
All attendees at the sixth FOS examination cycle (1995–1998) un-
derwent comprehensive 2-dimensional (2D) transthoracic echocar-
diography with Doppler color flow imaging as described previously.20 
Echocardiograms were read by a sonographer or a cardiologist who 
was blinded to clinical information. M-mode measurements, averaged 
over ≥ 3 cardiac cycles, were obtained from digitized images using 
the leading edge-to-leading edge technique for LAD, end-diastolic 
LV septal wall thickness, posterior wall thickness, and LV diameter 
at the end of diastole (LVDD) and LV diameter at the end of systole. 
Fractional shortening (FS) was calculated as: ([LVDD−LV diameter 
at the end of systole]/LVDD)×100, LV wall thickness was calculated 
by summing LV septal wall thickness and posterior wall thickness 
in end-diastole, and relative wall thickness (RWT) was obtained by 
dividing LV wall thickness by LVDD. We calculated LVM using the 
formula: LVM=0.8(1.04[{LVDD+posterior wall thickness+septal 
wall thickness}3−{LVDD}3])+0.6, based on American Society of 
Echocardiography (ASE) guidelines.21 LV hypertrophy was deter-
mined by indexing the LVM to body surface area, and values >115 
g/m2 for men and >95 g/m2 for women were considered abnormal.21 
LV systolic dysfunction (LVSD) was defined by FS <29% or by mild 
or greater reduction in ejection fraction based on qualitative assess-
ment. Using ASE cut points for normal LVM (≤115 g/m2 for men and 
≤95 g/m2 for women) and the normal RWT cut-point of ≤0.42,21 geo-
metric patterns were defined as: normal geometry (normal LVM and 
RWT), concentric remodeling (normal LVM and increased RWT), 
concentric hypertrophy (increased LVM and RWT), and eccentric 
hypertrophy (increased LVM and normal RWT), Table II in the Data 
Supplement.
Outcome Events
Participants were followed continuously throughout the study period 
for the incidence of CVD events including HF, which was defined 
using the FHS criteria.22 In brief, ascertainment of HF requires the 
presence of 2 major or 1 major and 2 minor criteria; major criteria 
include paroxysmal nocturnal dyspnea or orthopnea, increased ve-
nous pressure, distended neck veins, rales, cardiomegaly by radio-
graph, pulmonary edema, a third heart sound, hepatojugular reflux, 
and weight loss on diuretic therapy. The presence of ankle edema, 
nocturnal cough, hepatomegaly, dyspnea on exertion, pleural effu-
sion, decrease in vital capacity, and tachycardia comprise the minor 
criteria. Medical records were obtained for all physician visits and 
hospitalizations related to CVD, and events were adjudicated by a 
review committee of 3 FHS physicians. The date of onset of HF was 
determined by the earliest onset of symptoms, or the date of hospi-
talization or clinic visit. In secondary analyses, we assessed the as-
sociations between CVH score and HF subtype after categorizing HF 
events as HF with reduced ejection fraction (HFREF) if the ejection 
fraction was <45% and HF with preserved ejection fraction (HFPEF) 
if the ejection fraction was ≥45% based on echocardiographic reports 
from the index hospitalization.
Statistical Analysis
In both samples, the predictor of interest was the CVH score, which 
was modeled as a continuous variable in all primary analyses. Using 
sample 1, we examined the cross-sectional relations of the CVH score 
with (1) the following echocardiographic indices: LVM, LVDD, LV 
wall thickness, LAD, and FS in age- and sex-adjusted linear regres-
sion models; (2) the presence of LVSD and LV hypertrophy in age- 
and sex-adjusted logistic regression models (both binary variables); 
and (3) the presence of 4 LV geometric patterns (normal geometry, 
concentric remodeling, concentric hypertrophy, and eccentric hy-
pertrophy) in age- and sex-adjusted multinomial logistic regression 
models using generalized logits treating those with normal geometry 
as the referent group.
Using sample 2, we evaluated the prospective association be-
tween the CVH score and HF incidence using age- and sex-adjusted 
Cox proportional hazard regression models, after confirming that 
the assumption of proportionality of hazards was met. In secondary 
analyses, we examined the relations of CVH score with the incidence 
of HFPEF and HFREF (separate analyses for each). Fine-Gray pro-
portional hazard models were used to account for competing risks, 
including the HF subtype not modeled, and indeterminate HF events 
(ie, HF with unavailable EF). We examined penalized cubic splines to

assess for potential nonlinearity of the associations of the CVH score 
with HF, and with each of the HF subtypes.
In further secondary analyses, the CVH score was modeled in 
categories with grouping of 0 to 7, 8 to 9, and 10 to 14 (to provide 
approximate tertiles), treating the lower CVH tertile (scores, 0–7) as 
the referent. We also analyzed the CVH score as a 7-point score with 
each of the 7 AHA metrics considered as a binary variable. Sensitivity 
analyses were performed after removing the hypertension metric from 
the CVH score, thus constructing a score with a maximum value of 12 
points. Statistical significance was assessed based on a 2-sided P value 
of <0.05. The SAS Software version 9.3 (Cary, NC) was used for all 
analyses. The authors had full access to the data and take responsibility 
for its integrity. All authors have read and agree to the article as written.
Results
The baseline characteristics of the larger sample (sample 2) 
are shown in Table 1. Participants were mostly middle-aged 
and overweight with a high prevalence of hypertension. Ideal 
CVH was present in a small proportion of participants (Fig-
ure 1). Characteristics were similar in sample 1 (Table III and 
Figure I in the Data Supplement).
Association Between CVH Score and 
Echocardiographic Traits
In cross-sectional analyses, statistically significant associa-
tions between the CVH score and several echocardiographic 
measures were observed (Table 2). LVM was inversely asso-
ciated with CVH score, in concordance with its 2 primary 
components: LV wall thickness and LVDD. LAD also demon-
strated an inverse association with the CVH score. No statisti-
cally significant associations were observed between the CVH 
score and FS, LVSD, or LV hypertrophy.
Association Between CVH Score and Geometric 
Patterns of Cardiac Remodeling
Normal LV geometry was present in 1283 participants (54%), 
concentric remodeling in 486 (20%), eccentric hypertrophy in 
352 (15%), and concentric hypertrophy in 271 (11%). Each 
1-point higher CVH score was associated with a 12% and 15% 
lower odds of concentric remodeling and concentric hypertro-
phy, respectively, compared with the normal geometric pattern 
(Table 3). When the CVH score was analyzed according to 
categories, the higher CVH category (score, 10–14) had 42% 
and 54% lower odds of concentric remodeling and concen-
tric hypertrophy, respectively, when compared with the lower 
CVH category (score, 0–7; P<0.01 for both), Table IV in the 
Data Supplement. We did not observe a statistically significant 
association between the CVH score (continuous or categori-
cal) and the odds of eccentric hypertrophy.
Association Between CVH Score and HF Incidence
A total of 3201 participants were followed for ≤16 years 
(mean, 12.3 years) and 188 individuals developed HF (5.9%). 
The CVH score was inversely associated with incident HF 
(Figure 2). For each 1-point higher CVH score, we observed 
a 23% lower risk of HF, adjusting for age and sex (Table 4). 
When the CVH score was modeled as a categorical variable, 
the HF hazard ratio for CVH scores of 8 to 9 and 10 to 14 was 
45% and 66% lower, respectively, when compared with scores 
of 0 to 7 (Table V in the Data Supplement). The effect of CVH 
score on incident HF was partially attenuated when further 
adjusted for LVM and interim myocardial infarction (Table 4 
models 2–4), which occurred in 250 participants (7.8%). This 
partial attenuation is reflected by a 35% change in the param-
eter estimate corresponding to the CVH score (β=−0.26 in the 
model adjusted for age and sex as compared with β=−0.17 
in the model adjusted for age, sex, interim MI, and LVM). 
Further adjustments for B-type natriuretic peptide and urine 
albumin/creatinine ratio did not result in additional attenua-
tion (Table 4, model 5).
Association Between CVH Score and HF Subtype
Of the 188 participants with incident HF, 85 (45.2%) devel-
oped HFPEF, 89 (47.3%) developed HFREF, and in 14 (7.5%) 
subjects the HF subtype was indeterminate because of an 
unavailable EF. Using Fine-Gray Proportional Hazard models 
to adjust for competing risks, the relations of the CVH score 
with incident HF did not vary significantly by HF subtype 
(Table 5; Figure II in the Data Supplement). When adjusted 
for interim MI, the relation between the CVH score and the 
HFPEF remained essentially unchanged (β=−0.22 for model 
adjusted for age and sex as compared with β=−0.23 in the 
model adjusted for age, sex, and interim MI), whereas the 
association of CVH score and incident HFREF was mildly 
attenuated (β=−0.27 for model adjusted for age and sex as 
compared with β=−0.21 in the model adjusted for age, sex, 
and interim MI).
In secondary analyses, the CVH score was modeled in 
categories and as a 7-point score without notable differences

from these findings (data not shown). In addition, we per-
formed a sensitivity analyses after removing the hypertension 
metric from the CVH score (thus creating a 12-point CVH 
score), and the results were essentially unchanged (Tables 
VI–IX in the Data Supplement).
Discussion
Principal Findings
The principal findings of our report are 2-fold. First, CVH was 
inversely associated with the prevalence of several echocar-
diographic traits and with concentric forms of LV geometric 
patterns cross-sectionally. Second, CVH was inversely associ-
ated with HF incidence prospectively, a relation that was con-
sistent among the HF subtypes of HFPEF and HFREF, and it 
was partly attributable to the inverse association of CVH with 
the presence of adverse LV remodeling.
Comparison With Previous Studies
Ideal CVH was rare in our sample, consistent with findings 
from other community-based cohorts.13–16,23,24 Previous reports 
have demonstrated associations between CVH and a reduced 
incidence of cardiovascular outcomes, including stroke,15 
cardiovascular death,14,23 and the composite of CVD.13,16,25,26 
Several studies have demonstrated the beneficial effects of 
a healthy lifestyle on reducing HF incidence.6,7,27 However, 
these investigations focused primarily on 4 of the 7 compo-
nents of the CVH score, namely: abstinence from smoking, 
BMI ≤25 kg/m2, physical activity, and healthy diet, with 1 
study also including alcohol consumption. In each of these 
previous reports, there was a graded and stepwise association 
between the positive behavior or risk factor value achieved 
and a reduced risk of HF. Similarly, in our study we found 
that each point achieved in the CVH score was associated 
with a lower incidence of HF. Furthermore, we observed that 
this association was true for both HFPEF and HFREF; previ-
ous reports did not examine the association of CVH with HF 
subtypes.
Mechanisms Underlying the Association of CVH 
With a Reduction in HF Incidence
There are several plausible pathomechanisms responsible 
for the increased risk of HF in those with poor CVH. First, 
poor CVH is known to promote atherosclerotic vascular dis-
ease16,25 and, therefore, may lead to clinical HF via reductions

in ventricular systolic and diastolic function as a result of MI. 
Although this sequence of events is frequently encountered in 
clinical practice, the association between the CVH score and 
HF incidence was only mildly affected by adjusting for interim 
MI in our study. However, when HF incidence was assessed 
according to HF subtype, we did observe that the magni-
tude of association between the CVH score and HFREF was 
slightly attenuated after adjusting for interim MI, whereas the 
association between CVH score and HFPEF was unchanged. 
This is consistent with previous observations that ischemic 
heart disease is more closely related to incident HFREF than 
HFPEF. Certainly, subclinical ischemic heart disease resulting 
in reduced cardiac function without overt MI is another pos-
sible mechanism linking incident HF with poor CVH that was 
not assessed by this study.
Alternatively, our findings support a second plausible 
pathomechanism that poor CVH promotes a program of 
adverse cardiac remodeling that begins as subclinical changes 
in cardiac structure and function (AHA/American College of 
Cardiology stage B HF) and eventually progresses to clini-
cal HF (AHA/American College of Cardiology stage C HF). 
In our study, a lower CVH score was associated with higher 
LVM and LAD, and higher odds of having concentric remod-
eling or concentric hypertrophy. These abnormalities are asso-
ciated with incident HF and may suggest a mechanistic link 
between the CVH score and HF incidence. This notion is fur-
ther supported by the attenuation of the association between 
CVH score and incident HF when adjusted for LVM, suggest-
ing that increased LVM partially attenuates the relation.
Traditional cardiovascular risk factors leading to clinical 
HF via subclinical remodeling is biologically plausible and,

 6  Nayor et al  CVH Score and Heart Failure Incidence 
indeed, several of the components of the CVH score have been 
individually associated with both clinical HF and adverse car-
diac remodeling. Increased LVM, for example, is strongly 
associated with the presence of hypertension, diabetes mel-
litus, obesity, physical inactivity and smoking,28,29 whereas left 
atrial dilatation correlates with increasing age, BMI, elevated 
systolic BP and the use of antihypertensive medications.30 
Concentric geometric patterns of LV remodeling seem to be 
more related to the presence of hypertension and diabetes mel-
litus, whereas eccentric patterns may correlate more strongly 
with elevated BMI.31 Our data seem consistent with these find-
ings, suggesting that the CVH score may be an important cor-
relate of cardiac structure and geometry.
However, the associations of the CVH score with inci-
dent HF remain statistically significant after adjustment for 
LVM and other important HF predictors, such as interim MI, 
B-type natriuretic peptide, and urine albumin/creatinine ratio. 
These findings suggest that CVH may also be related to HF 
incidence independently of cardiovascular remodeling and 
MI. Therefore, a third plausible explanation for the observed 
association of CVH with HF incidence involves the positive 
effects of CVH on other organ systems or other components of 
the cardiovascular system. Endothelial dysfunction and vas-
cular stiffness, for example, are known precursors of HF that 
may be impacted by CVH. We did not have measures of vas-
cular stiffness at the sixth FOS examination cycle to examine 
this premise. Furthermore, the CVH score has been related 
to biomarkers of select biological pathways (such as B-type 
natriuretic peptide, Growth Differentiation Factor-15, inflam-
mation, renin–angiotensin–aldosterone pathway16) and the lat-
ter have been implicated in mediating HF risk.32,33 The CVH 
score may also be related to noncardiovascular predictors of 
HF, such as altered lung or renal function.34 A detailed explo-
ration of these possibilities was beyond the scope of our pres-
ent investigation. These and other novel mechanisms linking 
CVH with HF incidence are also possible and warrant further 
investigation in future reports.
Given the powerful effect of CVH score on incident HF, it 
is perhaps intriguing that relations were not observed between 
CVH score and FS, LVSD or eccentric hypertrophy. One 
potential explanation is that ischemic heart disease, which is 
more likely to lead to changes in ventricular function, LVSD, 
and eccentric remodeling was relatively uncommon in our 
middle-aged sample. In addition, the biological mechanisms 
underlying the associations of the CVH score with LV sys-
tolic function might be more complex than the mechanisms 
linking the CVH score with concentric hypertrophy. This 
notion is supported by data from the Multiethnic Study of 
Atherosclerosis (MESA) cohort, in which Heckbert et al28 
reported that ejection fraction increased with higher systolic 
BP until a critical point (≥180 mm Hg) after which it dem-
onstrated an inverse relationship. Diastolic BP, in contrast, 
was inversely associated with ejection fraction throughout its 
range of values.28,35 The CVH score does not take into account 
this level of complexity. For example, 2 individuals would 
both be assigned 0 points for the BP metric even if 1 had a BP 
of 140/90 mm Hg and the other had a BP of 190/120 mm Hg. 
In addition, we used relatively crude measures of LV pump 
function and not more sophisticated measures of myocardial 
performance (such as strain rate imaging, diastolic function, 
torsion, and synchronicity, all of which may contribute to HF 
risk and may be potentially related to the CVH score).
Strengths and Limitations
This study was performed in a large community-based sample 
under continuous surveillance for clinical outcomes (includ-
ing HF) during a long period of follow-up. Our findings are 
consistent with previous reports of the relation between tradi-
tional cardiovascular risk factors and HF incidence and extend 
this knowledge by specifically evaluating the impact of the 
CVH score on HF incidence, by analyzing the HF subtypes 
(HFPEF and HFREF) separately, and by examining a wide 
range of echocardiographic measures of cardiac remodeling.
However, several limitations also merit consideration. Our 
sample included predominantly white, middle-aged partici-
pants of European ancestry with a high prevalence of hyperten-
sion, potentially limiting the generalizability of our findings to 
other age groups and ethnicities with differing risk factor dis-
tributions. In addition, the exposure (CVH score) was assessed 
at a single examination and, therefore, changes in the score 
over time could not be assessed. Similarly, the cross-sectional 
nature of the echocardiographic measurements limits our abil-
ity to track changes in the indices over time and may lead to a 
regression dilution bias, which would be expected to result in 
an underestimation of the true underlying associations of CVH

 7  Nayor et al  CVH Score and Heart Failure Incidence 
with echocardiographic traits and with HF. We used M-mode 
echocardiography rather than 2D measurements and deter-
mined left atrial size by diameter rather than volume, both of 
which are potential limitations. Finally, the definitions used for 
diet and physical activity were extrapolated from data avail-
able from questionnaires completed at the clinical examina-
tions and differ slightly from the AHA metrics.16
Conclusions and Future Directions
Better CVH was associated with a lower risk of HF incidence 
in our large community-based sample. This association was 
probably at least partially attributable to a lower prevalence 
of adverse cardiac remodeling in those with a high CVH 
score. Further studies are warranted to evaluate the biological 
mechanisms underlying the associations between CVH and 
adverse cardiac remodeling, as well as to assess the role for 
potential interventions (behavioral and pharmacological) that 
might assist in preventing or delaying HF events in higher risk 
populations. Although observational, our findings provide evi-
dence that targeting strategies to improve CVH in the commu-
nity (using the CVH score as a metric) may potentially reduce 
the prevalence of subclinical HF stages (stage B) and perhaps 
overt HF as well.

CLINICAL PERSPECTIVE
Heart failure (HF) is an important public health problem, and evidence regarding appropriate tools to promote HF preven-
tion is currently limited. In 2010, the American Heart Association articulated 7 metrics of cardiovascular health (CVH) with 
the goal of improving CVH by 20% and as a result reducing CVD mortality by 20% by the year 2020. Using data from the 
Framingham Heart Study, we evaluated whether a score consisting of these 7 metrics is associated with cardiac remodeling 
and HF incidence in the community. In this well-characterized sample of predominantly middle-aged white individuals of 
European descent, a higher (better) CVH score was associated with lower left ventricular mass, left ventricular wall thick-
ness, left ventricular diastolic dimension, and left atrial dimension, and with lower odds of concentric remodeling patterns in 
cross-sectional analyses (among 2392 participants with echocardiographic imaging). Over a mean follow-up of ≈ 12 years, 
188 incident HF events (85 [45.2%] with preserved ejection fraction, 89 [47.3%] with reduced ejection fraction, and 14 
[7.5%] with unknown ejection fraction) were observed in 3201 participants. The CVH score was inversely associated with 
HF incidence with a 23% lower hazard of HF observed per 1-point higher CVH score. The association was consistent among 
the HF subtypes of preserved versus reduced ejection fractions. These findings suggest that the American Heart Association 
CVH score might be a valuable tool for public health efforts to promote HF prevention, and that the benefits of improved 
CVH might be related, in part, to a lower prevalence of adverse cardiac remodeling.
