Systemic treatment of cancer requires tumour-selective therapies that eliminate cancer cells
yet preserve healthy tissues from undesired damage. Tumoral transformation is associated
with profound effects in translational reprogramming of gene expression, such that tumour-
specific translational regulation presents an attractive possibility for generating oncoselective
therapies. We recently discovered that mRNA translational control by cytoplasmic
polyadenylation element-binding proteins (CPEBs) is reactivated in cancer. Here we present
a novel approach to restrict genetic-engineered therapies to malignant tissues based on CPEB
translational regulation of target mRNAs. We demonstrate that tumour reprogramming of
CPEB-mediated mRNA stability and translational regulation modulates tumour-specific
expression of viral proteins. For oncolytic adenoviruses, insertion of CPE regulatory
sequences in the 30-untranslated region of the E1A gene provides oncoselectivity, with full
potency in cancer cells but attenuated in normal tissues. Our results demonstrate the
potential of this strategy to improve oncolytic virus design and provide a framework for
exploiting CPE-regulated transgenes for therapy.

 R
egulation of transgene and viral protein expression is
required to increase the safety and efficacy of gene and
viral therapies. Delivery and expression of transgenes
with anticancer activity, or the use of conditionally replicating
viruses for cancer therapy, must be specific for tumours to avoid
side effects to healthy tissues. Most efforts to achieve such
selective control have been based on the use of tumour-specific
promoters1 and, more recently, by the engineering of target
site-recognizing,
tissue-specific
microRNA
(miRNA)2–6.
Although both strategies contribute highly to tumour selectivity,
it has become evident that the post-transcriptional regulation of
specific mRNA subpopulations contributes substantially to the
broad expression changes of genes responsible for the cancer
phenotype7. Thus, the translational reprogramming of tumour
cells has been proposed as a potential target for tumour-specific
drugs8.
These
tumour-specific
translational
profiles
could
therefore be used to generate tumour specificity to transgene
and viral protein expression.
One of the mechanisms to regulate the translation of specific
subpopulations of mRNAs is through the presence of cis-acting
elements in the 30-untranslated region (30-UTRs) of mRNAs, such as
the cytoplasmic polyadenylation element (CPE; 50-UUUUA1–2U-30).
The CPE is bound by CPE-binding proteins (CPEBs), a family of
four members conserved in their RNA-recognition domain but
distinct in their regulatory motifs (reviewed in refs 9,10). All four
CPEBs recognize RNA via tandem RNA recognition motifs located
in their C-terminal halves that are followed by ZZ domains11. The
RNA recognition motifs define two CPEB subfamilies (CPEB1 and
CPEB2–4). Both CPEB subfamilies regulate overlapping populations
of mRNAs and recognize similar cis-acting elements, albeit with
different affinities12–15. The N-terminal domain is highly variable in
both length and composition across various CPEB orthologues
and
paralogues16 and
contains
all
the
identified
regulatory
motifs, including phosphorylations17,18, monoubiquitination15 and
sumoylation19.
These
post-translational
modifications
dictate
whether
CPEBs
act
as
translational
repressors
or
promote
cytoplasmic
polyadenylation
and
subsequent
translational
activation (reviewed in refs 9,10). In turn, the specific arrangement
of CPEs, in number and in their relative position to other CPEs and
the polyadenylation signal20, together with the presence of additional
cis-acting
elements
such
as
AU-rich
elements
(AREs)21,
quantitatively determine whether a particular mRNA is repressed
or activated in a combinatorial code that responds to the activation
of
specific
CPEBs12.
Although
CPEBs
have
been
mainly
characterized as regulators of maternal mRNAs during the
transcriptionally silent germ cells, they also regulate cytoplasmic
polyadenylation in somatic and tumoral cells13,22–25. In fact, CPEBs
are extremely conserved within vertebrates (96% for CPEB1 and
99% for CPEB4), the CPEs and the CPE-combinatorial code are
conserved and functionally replaceable from frogs to mammals and
promote translational repression and activation in rodents and
humans13,21,26,27. CPEB levels and activities are differentially
regulated in tumours9,28. CPEB1 levels are decreased in several
human cancers29,30, and reduced levels of this protein have been
associated with increased malignancy both in human29 and
mouse23. In contrast, high CPEB4 expression levels in pancreatic
ductal adenocarcinoma and glioblastoma tumours correlated with
stimulation
of
tumour
growth,
angiogenesis
and
decreased
survival14. Furthermore, CPEB4 has been identified as one of the
seven genes with an expression profile that is associated with
colorectal cancer31.
Here we show the feasibility of using the tumoral reprogram-
ming of CPE-mediated translational regulation to provide
tumour selectivity to transgene expression. We have engineered
a particular CPE arrangement that activates translation in
tumour
cells
while
promoting
translational
repression
in
non-transformed cells. We then generated a modified adenovirus
in which the E1A protein expression is regulated by CPEBs,
to
obtain
oncoselectivity
and
attenuated
toxicity
in
non-transformed tissues. This novel targeting modality increases
the therapeutic index of an oncolytic adenovirus and provides
a new paradigm for its applicability to gene transfer-based
therapeutic approaches.
Results
CPEs provide oncoselectivity to replicative adenoviruses.
To identify the optimal sequences required for CPEB-dependent
tumour selectivity, we tested chimeric mRNAs with three
combinations of 30-UTRs fused to the d2EGFP open reading
frame. These mRNAs were expressed in a battery of normal
(HPDE) and tumour (RWP-1, PANC-1 and MIA PaCa-2)
pancreatic cells expressing variable levels of CPEB1 and CPEB4
(Fig. 1a). The first UTR was derived from Xenopus cyclin B1
(cB1) 30-UTR mRNA and contained two consensus CPEs and one
nonconsensus CPE. This CPE arrangement promotes both
translational
repression
by
unphosphorylated
CPEB1
and
translational activation by CPEB412,13,20. The second UTR was
synthetized by combining cB1 CPEs with an ARE sequence that
opposes
CPE-mediated
polyadenylation
and
translational
activation from the tumour-necrosis factor-a (TNF-a) 30-UTR
mRNA (TNF-a-cB1). The third UTR was generated from a
fragment of the tissue plasminogen activator (tPA) 30-UTR
mRNA that contains two CPEs and two ARE sequences14.
(Fig. 1b and Supplementary Table 1).
Lentiviruses
expressing
the
d2EGFP
with
the
indicated
30-UTRs or a control wild-type (WT)-30-UTR (without CPEs)
and a lentivirus with a destabilized dRFP bearing a control
30-UTR (WT) were used to coinfect the non-tumour HPDE cells
and the pancreatic cancer cell lines (Supplementary Fig. 1a).
For each combination of UTR and cell line, the resulting
d2EGFP-to-dRFP expression ratio indicated that cB1 was the
only 30-UTR promoting a differential translational control in
normal cells compared to cancer cells. Thus, cB1-30-UTR
repressed the expression of d2EGFP in HPDE cells as compared
to the dRFP control 30-UTR, whereas it promoted activation in
the cancer cells, with a stronger effect in PANC-1 (Fig. 1c).
Interestingly, for the four cell lines, the d2EGFP/dRFP ratio was
proportional to the CPEB4/CPEB1 ratio (Fig. 1a). As expected
from the role that the poly(A) tail has on mRNA stability,
reduced mRNA levels of d2EGFP-cB1-30-UTR were detected in
HPDE cells as compared to tumour cells (Supplementary Fig. 1b).
On the other hand, the two 30-UTRs with ARE sequences led
to reduced d2EGFP expression in all the cell lines, indicating
that the destabilization effect of the ARE dominates over the
effects of CPE regulation (Fig. 1c).
Next, we took advantage of the specific regulation promoted by
the cB1-30-UTR to generate an oncoselective replication-compe-
tent adenovirus Ad5. For this, we targeted viral replication by
designing a virus in which the translation of E1A mRNA was
regulated by CPEBs. The adenoviral immediate-early E1A gene
was selected because it is the first gene transcribed after an
adenoviral infection and thus acts as a master transcriptional
regulator of further early viral genes and modifies several cell host
functions required for viral DNA replication. We then replaced
the WT-30-UTR of the viral E1A coding sequence with the
cB1-30-UTR to give us AdCPE (Fig. 2a). Substitution of E1A
WT-30-UTR by cB1-30-UTR had no effect on the transcription
of this gene, as shown by the equal levels of pre-mRNA for
both 30-UTRs in normal and cancer cell lines (Fig. 2b). However,
when the steady-state levels of mature transcripts were compared,
we found E1A-cB1-30-UTR mRNA to be significantly lower in

 HPDE cells as compared to E1A-WT-30-UTR mRNA as well
as reduced with respect to E1A- cB1-30-UTR mRNA in tumour
cells (Fig. 2b). This suggests a specific destabilization of the
mRNA-containing CPEs in the non-tumour cells. Because
the destabilization of the CPE-containing c-myc mRNA in
non-transformed cells has been directly associated with its
cytoplasmic deadenylation25, we measured the polyA tail length
of the different E1A transcripts in the four cell lines by RNA
ligation-coupled PCR with reverse transcription (RT–PCR)
analysis (Fig. 2c). We found that the CPE-mediated desta-
bilization of the E1A-cB1 mRNA in HPDE cells was associated
with a shorter polyA tail (Fig. 2d), which resulted in reduced
E1A
protein
expression
from
the
cB1-30-UTR
mRNA
as compared with the WT-30-UTR (Fig. 2e). Accordingly,
AdCPE-infected
non-transformed
cells
(HPDE)
showed
a strong reduction in viral genome copy numbers (Fig. 2f)
and decreased cytotoxicity (increased half-maximal inhibitory
concentration (IC50); Fig. 2g) as compared to the control
virus Adwt. The lowest performance of AdCPE was also
observed in human primary fibroblasts and the non-tumoral
human kidney epithelial HK-2 cells (Fig. 2e,f and Supplementary
Fig. 2). However, in the tumour cells, cB1-30-UTR was as efficient
as the WT-30-UTR in supporting optimum levels of viral-driven
E1A expression (Fig. 2e), which in turn resulted in equal
viral genome copy numbers and IC50 from both 30-UTRs
(Fig. 2f,g). CPEB-mediated control of E1A expression and
viral release was also observed in AdCPE-infected colorectal
and glioblastoma cells as well as in the patient-derived pancreatic
tumour CP15 (Supplementary Fig. 2). The similar effects of
Adwt and AdCPE in cancer cells also highlight that the small
size of the cB1-30-UTR did not compromise virus fitness
and packaging efficiency.
CPE-mediated oncoselectivity is provided by CPEB4. To
determine whether the higher CPEB4 levels in tumour cells
caused the specificity of cB1-30-UTR regulation of mRNA
translation, we first confirmed the specificity of CPEB4 binding
to the CPEs in cB1-30-UTR. As shown by RIP, CPEB4 bound
cB1-30-UTR WT in a CPE-dependent manner. In contrast, HuR,
an ARE-binding protein that promotes mRNA stabilization,
displayed almost negligible binding to cB1-30-UTR WT that
was
not
affected
by
the
mutations
that
inactivate
the
CPE (Supplementary Fig. 3). Then, we knocked down CPEB4 in
tumoral RWP-1 cells (RWP-1-sh4) and compared it with a
control non-target shRNA (RWP-1-shNT) (Fig. 3a). Depletion of
CPEB4
(RWP-1-sh4)
caused
a
significant
reduction
of
E1A protein levels expressed from AdCPE (Fig. 3b), with the
subsequent reduction of viral replication (Fig. 3c) and increased
IC50 values (Fig. 3d). On the other hand, Adwt was unaffected by
a CPEB4 knockdown (Fig. 3b–d). Similar results were observed in
HCT-116 colorectal and T98 glioblastoma cells (Supplementary
Fig. 4). A reverse approach, of overexpressing CPEB4 in
non-tumour cells (HPDE), partially rescued the expression of
E1A from AdCPE (Fig. 3e) and viral replication (Fig. 3f), as
compared to Adwt. Therefore, high levels of CPEB4 seem to be
required for the oncoselective behaviour of the engineered virus
and to prevent the CPE-mediated translational repression
observed in non-tumour cells.
Oncoselectivity of AdCPE in vivo. To investigate whether
AdCPE provides oncolytic specificity in vivo, nude mice carrying
subcutaneous tumours were intravenously injected with Adwt
or AdCPE viral particles, and tumour growth was monitored.
In consonance with the results obtained in cell culture models,
we found that AdCPE produced a significant inhibition of

 toxicity. To test the AdCPE effects on healthy tissues in vivo,
we intravenously injected immunocompetent mice with Adwt
and AdCPE, at the same viral dose used in the xenograft
experiments. Three days later, we quantified viral proteins and
viral genomes in the liver, pancreas and kidney. E1A protein
levels were significantly reduced in the liver of AdCPE-treated
mice, as compared to Adwt (Fig. 4b). Quantification of mRNA of
E1A, hexon and fibre in the liver, pancreas and kidney revealed
significantly reduced levels of the three mRNAs in AdCPE-
injected mice as compared to Adwt (Fig. 4c). Consistent
with in vitro data, E1A pre-mRNA levels in liver extracts from
AdCPE and Adwt were similar, whereas the mature mRNA was
reduced in AdCPE mice (Supplementary Fig. 7a). These results
indicate that the CPE-dependent destabilization of viral mRNA is
recapitulated in vivo. Despite the impairment of human Ad5 to
productively replicate in mice, a low level of replication has been
proposed to occur33, which is sufficient to detect differences
between AdCPE and Adwt. Analysing viral genomes in the liver,
pancreas and kidney showed, as expected, that most of the
virus was retained in the liver, but that viral genomes were also
present in the other organs. Interestingly, animals injected with
AdCPE had a reduced viral content (of 18-fold in the liver, 7-fold
in the pancreas and 6-fold in the kidney) as compared to Adwt
(Fig. 4d). This effect was not associated with differences in viral
titres, since the number of viral genomes that reached the liver at
4 h after injection, previous to any replication event, was similar
between
AdCPE-
and
Adwt-injected
mice
(Supplementary
Fig. 7b). The attenuated activity of AdCPE in murine healthy
tissues was further confirmed in human primary hepatocytes,
a model fully permissive for adenoviral replication (Suppleme-
ntary Fig. 8). Thus, AdCPE activity is highly impaired in normal
tissues when compared to Adwt.
Finally, to study liver damage-associated toxicity, which is one
of the major side effects of Ad-expressing E1A, we analysed body
weight, macroscopic liver appearance and serum parameters in
mice after intravenous delivery of Adwt or AdCPE. Adwt caused
a progressive loss of weight, whereas AdCPE led to a decrease in
body weight by day 1, which then remained stable for the
following days (Fig. 4e). Livers injected with Adwt showed
a steatotic appearance that was not observed in AdCPE livers
(Fig. 4f). Aspartate aminotransferase and alanine aminotransfer-
ase
enzyme
activities
showed
a
remarkable
increase
in
Adwt-injected animals with respect to the saline group, whereas
a 4-fold lower induction was detected in AdCPE-injected mice
(Fig. 4g). Altogether, these results indicate a reduced toxic profile
of the AdCPE virus as compared to Adwt, while maintaining
its oncolytic potential.
Discussion
Oncolytic viruses are advancing to clinical trials and are being
envisioned as breakthrough agents in oncology in the near future.
Accordingly, optimized engineered viruses are under develop-
ment to maximize their anticancer effects34. However, as their
potency increases, so do potentially associated toxicities, pointing
to the need to develop highly tumour-specific viruses. We show
that engineering adenoviruses with CPE regulatory elements, to
control
E1A
expression
post-transcriptionally,
resulted
in
attenuated viral activity in normal cells while maintaining, or
even increasing, potency in cancer cells. The specificity of the
antitumour response is directly derived from the ectopic
expression of CPEB4 in tumours14. Thus, depletion of CPEB4
attenuates viral activity in tumour cells, while its overexpression
in non-transformed cells increases viral replication. In turn,
the levels of CPE-mediated expression may be further increased
by reduced levels of CPEB1. These results are consistent with
a scenario in which CPEB1 in non-transformed cells (in which its
levels are high) represses CPE-containing mRNAs22. In tumour
cells, on the other hand, CPEB1 levels are reduced9,28, while
CPEB4 levels are increased14, which promotes cytoplasmic
polyadenylation and thereby increases mRNA stability and
translation
of
CPE-regulated
transcripts.
Importantly,
viral
genome replication is dependent on CPEB4 activity and can
only occur in tumour cells. This leads to the production of fully
competent viruses in tumour cells but attenuated ones in healthy
tissues. Accordingly, the CPE-regulated virus maintains its
oncolytic capacity in tumour cells while significantly reducing
its damage to non-tumour tissues, which is mainly in the liver
as this is the target organ of adenovirus sequestration on
intravascular delivery. This increased selectivity allows for an
enhanced therapeutic index, since increased antitumour capacity
was obtained after AdCPE treatment at viral doses that, with
Adwt injection, compromised mice survival.
We demonstrate here a novel approach to fine-tuning
protein expression in a tumour-selective manner by exploiting
the post-transcriptional reprogramming of gene expression in
tumour cells to control selectivity of an oncolytic virus. Our
results have been validated in pancreatic cancer models. However,
since CPEB4 is overexpressed in several tumours, such as gliomas
and colorectal cancers14,31, this oncoselective strategy may be
valid for many solid tumours. This approach may overcome some
of the limitations associated with other commonly used postentry
viral targeting approaches. Taking advantage of a tumour-
selective control by tumour-specific promoters is confronted
with the fact that most of the genome is constantly transcribed at
low levels, and is a strategy restricted to viruses that rely on the
cellular transcription machinery but not for viruses that use
virally encoded polymerases for replication in the cytoplasm, such
as the measles virus and vaccinia virus34. The alternative
postentry strategy to regulate viral replication is a negative
targeting approach based on the miRNA expression in normal
tissues
to
restrict
viral
replication
of
miRNA-target
site-
engineered viruses. Indeed, this is a very versatile approach for
many different viruses and is highly efficient. However, the
evolution of escape mutants in miRNA-targeted viruses, or the
potential off-target effects on the host miRNA machinery, have
been proposed as potential caveats6. Interestingly, no mutations
were found in the CPE-regulated adenovirus under evolutionary
pressure (Supplementary Fig. 9). To achieve a tight restriction of
replication to tumour cells, it should be possible to combine
different targeting strategies such as regulation by more than one
viral gene3 or the introduction of transcriptional and post-
transcriptional control in the same viral gene35. In this line,
a double E1A-engineered virus, with the uPAR promoter and
the CPE post-transcriptional control, displayed additivity in
a non-tumoral context (Supplementary Fig. 10).
This novel tropism-modified strategy presented here provides
a framework for exploiting CPE-regulated transgenes to achieve
cancer cell-specific expression in therapeutic gene-transfer-based
strategies, or to attenuate viruses for vaccine purposes. This
technology could also extend to other viruses of interest in
virotherapy that require attenuation in particular tissues, such as
reoviruses in heart36 or coxsackievirus A21 in the muscle5.
Altogether, our data provide a novel paradigm for the
development of tumour-specific viruses and provide the proof
of principle that CPEB-dependent regulation can be exploited to
attenuate viral toxicity, by preventing the spread of the virus in
normal tissues, without perturbation of the antitumour efficacy.

 kidney cell lines HEK293, 293T and RPE (retinal pigment epithelial) cells were
obtained from the American Type Culture Collection (ATCC, Manassas,
VA, USA). RWP-1 and CP15 cells were derived from human pancreatic
adenocarcinoma biopsies perpetuated as xenograft in nude mice37,38. Non-tumour
fibroblasts were kindly provided by Dr Eva Vaquero (Institut d’investigacions
Biome
`diques August Pi i Sunyer, Barcelona, Spain). RWP-1, CP15, PANC-1,
MIA PaCa-2, T98, U87, fibroblasts and RPE cells were maintained in DMEM
supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum (Gibco-BRL, Carlsbad, CA, USA).
DLD-1 and HCT-116 cells were maintained in RPMI-1640 (Gibco-BRL) or
McCoy’s 5A (Gibco-BRL) medium, respectively, supplemented with 10% fetal
bovine serum. Immortal human pancreatic duct epithelial HPDE cells, kindly
provided by Dr F.X. Real (CNIO, Madrid, Spain), were cultured and maintained
as reported39. Human hepatocytes were obtained from Biopredic International
(St Gregoire, France) and maintained according to the manufacturer’s instructions.
RWP-1 shNT, sh2 and sh4 were described previously14. HCT-116 and T98 shNT
and sh4 cells were generated by transducing parental cells with shNT- and
sh4-expressing lentiviruses14. HPDE-CPEB4-expressing cells were established by
transducing parental cells with CPEB4 recombinant lentivirus. Mycoplasma
contamination was tested by PCR routinely.
Lentiviral constructs with a modified 30-UTR. The polyadenylation sequences
(4,193–4,199 and 4,423–4,429) from the pLS-CG lentiviral vector (Addgene; no.
12161) were mutagenized with the help of the QuickChange II Site-Directed
Mutagenesis Kit (Stratagene, Wilmington, NC, USA) according to the manu-
facturer’s instructions (see Supplementary Table 1 for primers). Mutagenized
sequences were verified by DNA sequencing.
d2EGFP and d2RFP genes were cloned by PCR with specific primers
incorporating the AgeI and XhoI restriction sites. The 30-UTR of tPA was
PCR amplified using specific primers with sequences for the XhoI restriction
enzyme at both ends. The 30-UTR of cB1 was designed in the reverse primer
of d2EGFP gene with a sequence for the XhoI restriction enzyme. The 30-UTR
with the TNF-a ARE sequences was generated by amplifying the previously
generated cB1 30-UTR with a primer containing the TNF-a main ARE sequence
upstream of the CPE sites.
All primer sequences are listed in Supplementary Table 1. The indicated
sequences were cloned into the pLS-CG lentiviral vector. The newly generated
vectors were sequenced to confirm the DNA sequence.
Lentiviral production. Lentiviral particles were generated by cotransfection
of plasmids pCMVAR8.91, pVSV-G and the pLS-CG-derived constructs, or
a lenitiviral plasmid expressing CPEB4, in 293T cells by the calcium/phosphate
DNA precipitation method (Clontech, Mountain View, CA, USA). Supernatants
from 293T-transfected cells were collected at 24 and 48 h, filtered and processed
for purification by ultracentrifugation for 2 h at 12 �C at 20,200 r.p.m. After
ultracentrifugation, the pellet was resuspended in PBS for 16 h at 4 �C under
constant agitation, aliquoted and frozen at –80 �C for later use.
Viral titration was performed by quantitative PCR (qPCR) with specific primers
against the PBC-Psi region of the pLS-CG vector (listed in Supplementary Table 1).
A standard curve was generated using serial dilutions of pLS-CG-d2EGFP-30-
UTR_tPA construct mixed with genomic DNA. The number of molecules was
calculated using the formula: M ¼ (C � 6.02 � 1023)/(660 � bp), where C is the
concentration of the plasmid, bp the number of base pairs and M the number of
vector molecules.
Flow cytometry assay. Flow cytometry assays were performed in HPDE, RWP-1,
PANC-1 and MIA PaCa-2 cells. Forty thousand cells were plated per well in
12-multiwell plates and, 24 h postseeding, cells were transduced with the indicated
lentiviruses at 12 multiplicity of infection per virus. Transduction was facilitated
by spinning for 2 h at 12,000 r.p.m. Two days post-transduction, d2EGFP and
dRFP levels were analysed by flow cytometry using BD LSR II (Becton Dickinson).
Flow cytometry results were analysed using FlowJo 8.7 for Macintosh.
Adenovirus generation. The AdCPE genome was generated by the following
steps: first, the E1A polyA sequence of the pEND-K plasmid was mutated from
50-AATAAA-30 to 50-ACTCGA-30, generating a new XhoI restriction site with the
primer 50-GCTGAATGAGATTGATGTAAGTTTACTCGAGGGTGAGATA
ATGTTTAACTTGC-30 using the QuickChange Multi Site-Directed Mutagenesis
Kit (Stratagene, Wilmington, NC, USA). Second, the construct containing E1A
and the 30-UTR of cB1 with the three CPE sequences was generated directly by
PCR, by amplifying Adwt E1A with the primers 50-CCTTGGGTCCGGTTTCTA
TGCC-30 and 50-CGTCTCGAGGCTTTATTAAAACCAGTAAAACATTAA
AAACACAATACACTATTTACAGAAGCACATGGTGCAACACTTAT
GGCCTGGGGCGTTTACAGC-30. Third, the E1A from the pEND-K with
the mutated polyA sequence was replaced by the PCR product, using AgeI and
XhoI restriction sites, to generate pEND-K-E1A-cB1. Finally, AdCPE was
generated by homologous recombination of pEND-K-E1A-cB1 with the genome of
the serotype 5 wild-type adenovirus in E. coli BJ5183 cells as described40.
Adwt was obtained from ATCC. AduPAR was described previously40. AdDUC
genome was generated by incorporating the CPE containing 30-UTR of E1A into
the BoxI and AflII restriction sites of the pSH-DM-UPAR-E1A plasmid followed by
recombination of the resulting plasmid with the Adwt genome in BJ5183 cells as
described previously40.
Adwt, AdCPE, AduPAR and AdDUC were propagated in A549 cells and
purified by cesium chloride banding. The concentration of viral particles (vp ml � 1)
was determined by means of optical density, and infectious particles (pfu ml � 1)
were determined by hexon immunostaining in HEK293 cells41. Both viruses
presented equal vp per pfu ratio.
Western blot analysis. Protein extracts were obtained with lysis buffer
(50 mM Tris-HCl at pH 6.8, 2% SDS) containing 1% Complete Mini Protease
Inhibitor (Roche Diagnostics, Basel, Switzerland). BCA Protein Assay Kit
(Pierce-Thermo Fisher Scientific, Waltham, MA, USA) was used to determine
the protein concentration, and total proteins (35 mg) were resolved by electro-
phoresis on 7.5% gels and transferred to nitrocellulose membranes by standard
methods. Membranes were immunoblotted with rabbit anti-adenovirus-2/5
E1A polyclonal antibody (1:200; clone 13S-5; Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Dallas,
TX, USA) or anti-CPEB4 antibody (1:200; Abcam, Cambridge, UK) or anti-CPEB1
(1:200; 13274-1-AP; ProteinTech, IL, USA) 1 h at room temperature. Blots were
rinsed with TBS-T and incubated for 45 min at room temperature with horseradish
peroxidase-conjugated goat anti-rabbit immunoglobulin G (DakoCytomation,
Glostrup, Denmark). Antibody labelling was detected by the enhanced chemilu-
minescent method (Amersham Biosciences, Amersham, UK). Western blot
expression data for E1A, CPEB1 and CPEB4 were normalized to glyceraldehyde
3-phosphate dehydrogenase. Uncropped scans of western blots presented in the
main figures are provided in Supplementary Fig. 11.
cDNA synthesis and real-time qPCR. RNA was obtained and isolated using
RNeasy Mini Kit (Qiagen, Venlo, The Netherlands). A total of 1 mg was reverse
transcribed using Moloney murine leukemia virus reverse transcriptase and
random decamers (Ambion, Carlsbad, CA, USA). One microlitre of the reaction
was used as a template for the qPCR amplification reaction (LightCycler 480SYBER
Green I Master Mix; Roche Diagnostics) in a thermocycler (ViiA 7 Real-Time
PCR System; Applied Biosystems), using the following set of primers: E1A Fw,
50-CGGCCATTTCTTCGGTAATA-30 and E1A Rev, 50-CCTCCGGTGATAA
TGACAAG-30; Hexon Fw, 50- GTCTACTTCGTCTTCGTTGTC-30 and
Hexon Rev, 50-TGGCTTCCACGTACTTTG-30; and Fibre Fw, 50-CTCCA
ACTGTGCCTTTTC-30 and Fibre Rv, 50-GGCTCACAGTGGTTACATT-30.
Quantitative expression data were normalized to Gdx Fw, 50-GGCAGCTGAT
CTCCAAAGTCCTGG-30 and Gdx Rev, 50-AACGTTCGATGTCATCCAG
TGTTA-30. d2EGFP and dRFP were detected with the primers: d2EGFP Fw,
50-CAACAGCCACAACGTCTATATCAT-30 and d2EGFP Rv, 50-ATGTTGTG
GCGGATCTTGAAG-30; and dRFP Fw, 50-GCCCTTCGCCTGGGACAT-30 and
dRFP Rv, 50-GGTGCTTCACGTACACCTTGGA-30. Quantitative expression
data were normalized using the primers ACTB Fw, 50-CTGGAACGGTGA
AGGTGACA-30 and ACTB Rv, 50-GGGAGAGGACTGGGCCATT-30.
RNA-immunoprecipitation and RT–qPCR. RPE cells were transfected at
80% confluence with 25 mg of pCMV-lucRenilla plasmid (cB1-30-UTR WT or
cB1-30-UTR Mut)27 using Lipofectamine LTX and PLUS Reagent (Thermo Fisher
Scientific, Waltham, MA, USA) for 48 h. After transfection, cells were crosslinked
with 0.5% formaldehyde in free DMEM for 5 min at room temperature. Then, cells
were lysed with RIPA buffer supplemented with EDTA-free protease inhibitor
cocktail (Sigma-Aldrich, Saint Louis, MO, USA) and 200 U ml � 1 RiboLock RNAse
Inhibitor (Thermo Fisher Scientific). Cell lysates were sonicated for 5 min at
low intensity and centrifuged for 30 min at 13,200 r.p.m. and at 4 �C. Eight
hundred micrograms of lysates were precleared with 20 ml of Dynabeads protein A
(Thermo Fisher Scientific) for 30 min at 4 �C. Finally, they were incubated with
5 mg of anti-CPEB4 antibody (Abcam; ab83009) or anti-HuR antibody (Santa Cruz
Biotechnology, sc-5261) or anti-immunoglobulin G antibody (Sigma-Aldrich)
coupled to 50 ml of Dynabeads protein A overnight at 4 �C. One-fourth of the
immunoprecipitates were eluted with Laemmli sample buffer by heating at 65 �C
for 20 min, resolved in SDS–polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and analysed by
western blotting. Three-fourth of remaining immunoprecipitates were digested
with proteinase K during 1 h at 65 �C, and the RNA was isolated by phenol
extraction. All the RNAs were treated with DNAse (Thermo Fisher Scientific)
and retrotranscribed with random hexamers and Oligo d(T)20, using SuperScript
IV Reverse Transcriptase (Thermo Fisher Scientific) and subjected to qPCR.
The resulting cDNAs were used for gene-specific qPCR, using the following
primers: pLucORF Fw, 50-ACTGGGACGAAGACGAACAC-30; pLucORF Rv,
50-GGCGACGTAATCCACGATCT-30; Renilla S, 50-GATAACTGGTCCGC
AGTGGT-30; Renilla AS, 50-ACCAGATTTGCCTGATTTGC-30. Fold enrichment
of luciferase mRNA in the immunoprecipitated fraction was calculated after
normalization with the gene expression from the inputs.
Viral genome quantification. Viral DNA was obtained from supernatants, cellular
extracts or frozen tissues using the UltraClean BloodSpin DNA Isolation Kit
(Mo Bio Laboratories, Carlsbad, CA, USA) according to the manufacturer’s
instructions. Viral genomes were determined by real-time qPCR using the

 SYBER Green I Master plus mix (Roche Diagnostics) and the primers Hexon
Fw, 50-GCCGCAGTGGTCTTACATGCACATC-30 and Hexon Rv, 50-CAGCAC
GCCGCGGATGTCAAAG-30. Adenoviral copy number was relativized to the
cellular DNA content using the albumin intron 12 primers of Fw, 50-CTGTC
ATCTCTTGTGGGCTGT-30 and Rv, 50-GGCTATCCAAACTCATGGGAG-30.
In vitro cell survival studies. Dose–response curves were constructed for all
assessed cells transduced with doses ranging from 0.001 vp per cell to 10,000 vp
per cell of Adwt or AdCPE. Cell viability was measured 3 days postinfection
by a colorimetric assay following the manufacturer’s instructions (MTT Ultrapure;
USB, Cleveland, OH, USA).
Polyadenylation assays. Polyadenylation patterns were evaluated using
a modified version of the RNA ligation-coupled RT–PCR presented previously42.
One microgram of total RNA was ligated to 0.1 mg of P1 anchor primer
(50-P-GGTCACCTTGATCTCAAGC-NH2-30) in 10 ml reaction using T4 RNA
ligase I (New England Biolabs, Ipswich, MA, USA) according to the manufacturer’s
instructions. Half of the reaction product was used in a 50 ml reverse transcription
reaction with PrimeScript RT–PCR (Takara Bio, Mountain View, CA, USA)
according to the manufacturer’s instructions, using 0.1 mg of P10 as a reverse
primer (50-GCTTCAGATCAAGGTGACCTTTTT-30). An aliquot (2.5 ml) of this
cDNA preparation was used for a first pre-PCR step with Fw-E1A-polyA primer
(50-GGTGTAAACCTGTGATTGCG-30). One microlitre of this reaction was later
used in each 25 ml PCR with the primers Fw-E1A-polyA and P10.
Toxicity analysis. PBS or 2 � 1010 vp of Adwt or AdCPE were injected intrave-
nously into the tail vein of 6- to 8-week-old male immunocompetent C57BL/6
mice. Animals were weighed and examined daily for any clinical signs of toxicity.
Three days later, mice were killed, organs were isolated and blood samples were
collected by intracardiac puncture. Serum aspartate aminotransferase and alanine
aminotransferase were determined on an Olympus AU400 Analyser (Olympus,
Tokyo, Japan) at the Clinical Biochemistry Service, School of Veterinary Medicine,
Autonomous University of Barcelona. All animal procedures met the guidelines of
European Community Directive 86/609/EEC and were approved by the ethical
committee (CEEA-University of Barcelona) and by the local authorities of the
Generalitat de Catalunya.
Mouse xenografts. RWP-1, MIA PaCa-2 and PANC-1 cells (2.5 � 106), embed-
ded in Matrigel 1:1 (BD Biosciences, San Jose, CA, USA), were subcutaneously
injected into each flank of male, 7- to 8-week-old, athymic nu/nu mice
(Harlan, Sant Feliu de Codines, Spain). Tumours were measured at least three
times weekly, and their volumes were calculated using the formula V ¼ larger
diameter � (smaller diameter)2 � pi�6. Mice were randomly assigned to either
group for treatment. Virus was administered once tumours achieved a median
volume of 100 mm3. The experimenter was blinded until the conclusion of
the study.
Statistical analyses. The descriptive statistical analysis was performed on
GraphPad Prism v5.0a (GraphPad Software, La Jolla, CA, USA). Statistical
differences were evaluated using nonparametric two-tailed Mann–Whitney test.
Po0.05 was taken as the level of significance.
Statistical analyses for the d2EGFP/dRFP quantification were performed
using R (version 2.10.0) and the ARM package, to perform the mixed model by
REML and multcomp package for multiple comparison analysis of means by the
Tukey–Kramer test.
Sample size calculation for animal studies took into consideration to have more
than five mice in each group.
The in vivo tumour growth statistical analysis was evaluated using R v2.14.1
software (R: a language and environment for statistical computing; R Foundation
for Statistical Computing, Vienna, Austria) with a linear mixed-effect model
using the lme4 package. We associated a random-effects term with the day of
measurement43. Statistical differences were evaluated using a multiple comparison
of means by Tukey’s contrasts.
