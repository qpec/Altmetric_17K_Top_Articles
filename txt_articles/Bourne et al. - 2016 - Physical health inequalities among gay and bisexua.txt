ABSTRACT
Background Gay and bisexual men experience a disproportionate burden of ill health compared with the general male population. However, little
is known regarding health inequalities that exist within this group. We describe five key physical health indicators and their variation across
common axes of inequality.
Methods Community-based opportunistic sampling recruited 5799 gay and bisexual men to a self-completion Internet survey. Respondents
provided data relating to their height, weight, physical activity and substance use (tobacco, alcohol, illicit drugs). Responses were compared across
seven demographic characteristics.
Results Indicators of problematic health behaviour were concentrated within different groups and inequalities were rarely observed in the same
direction. Older men were more likely to be overweight and drink alcohol frequently but less likely to smoke or use illicit drugs. Men of Asian
ethnicity were more likely to exercise infrequently but less likely to smoke. Men living in London were more likely to smoke and use illicit drugs but
less likely to be overweight. However, lower education was associated with being overweight, frequent alcohol, low exercise and smoking.
Conclusion There is evidence of significant demographic variation in physical health-related behaviours among gay and bisexual men, and men
with lower levels of education are consistently in greater need.
Keywords alcohol consumption, drug use, exercise, health inequalities, male homosexuality, smoking
Introduction
The majority of public health data analysis relating to sexual
orientation considers differences in health outcomes between
sexual majorities and sexual minorities, usually finding out-
comes to be worse among minorities.1,2 Minority stress
theory is currently the dominant explanation for differences
in health between sexual minorities and the sexual majority.3
However, little data are available about health inequalities
within sexual minorities.
Describing health inequalities within sexual minorities is
challenging primarily due to sampling. Large representative
samples are theoretically possible but remain practically un-
feasible. There is no sampling frame for sexual minorities
and, as they form small proportions of the population, even
large representative general population surveys recruit only a
small absolute numbers of sexual minority men and women.
The majority of population health research with sexual minor-
ities has therefore used convenience samples.
With regard to health differences within gay and bisexual
men, studies (in Australia and North America) have identified
higher rates of smoking among white compared with ethnic
minority men4 and higher rates of alcohol use among young
compared with older men.5 However, to date, there has been
no published data from the UK that examines diversity in
health-related behaviour among male sexual minorities beyond
those which focuses on HIV/STI transmission behaviour.
The aim of the current analysis is to describe variation in
health behaviours and indicators of physical health among a large
(N ¼ 5799) community-recruited sample of gay and bisexual

 living in England. We consider five indicators (overweightness,
low exercise, frequent alcohol consumption, smoking tobacco
and illicit drug use) across seven demographics (age, ethnicity,
educational attainment, migrancy, household, income and
living in London).
Methods
The Stonewall Gay and Bisexual Men’s Health Survey 2011
was an online, anonymous, self-completed survey. Eligibility
was identifying as gay or bisexual (or using another term indi-
cating same-sex attraction), aged 16 years or over and living in
England.
Recruitment
We attempted to reduce bias through snowball sampling with
multiple entry points into the population, drawing upon the
communications networks of Stonewall, a sexual minority
rights charity. The survey was promoted to �500 employers
who were members of Stonewall’s Diversity Champions pro-
gramme, between them employing around 5 million people
across the public, private and third sectors. Employers in turn
promoted the survey to their employees, networks and
service-users/clients. Requests to participate and to promote
the survey were sent to email lists of gay community leaders
and professional networks. Between March and October
2011 the survey was repeatedly promoted by Stonewall
through social media—Facebook (�20 000 friends) and Twitter
(�10 000 followers). Several high profile gay celebrities and
large gay businesses tweeted and posted links. The survey
was promoted to Stonewall’s education campaign contacts
(�2000 people), including schools, universities and local au-
thorities who in turn promoted it to their contacts, networks
and mailing lists. Finally, a small amount of paid advertising
was undertaken for a period of 4 weeks on an MSM news and
dating website (Gaydar.co.uk).
Measures
All measures were self-reported. We used five commonly used
measures of physical health drawn from existing UK surveys:
Body Mass Index (BMI, weight divided by squared height);
typical number of days per week featuring moderate to vigor-
ous physical activity of at least 30 min6; number of days in past
week on which alcohol was consumed7; tobacco smoking
history (never smoked/have smoked but not at the moment/
current smoker)7 and illicit drugs used in the last 4 weeks.8
All outcomes were coded as binary variables: ‘overweight’
was defined as BMI equal to or .25 (as per the World Health
Organisation definition [9]); ‘low exercise’ was defined as
reporting at least 30 min moderate to vigorous physical activity
on fewer than 5 days per week (the current UK government
recommendation [6]); ‘frequent alcohol’ was defined as drink-
ing on 4 or more days a week, to identify those not following
the Royal College of Physicians recommendation for alcohol-
free days10; ‘current smoking’ was defined as responding
affirmatively to ‘Do you smoke cigarettes at all nowadays?’;
‘illicit drug use’ was defined as reporting having taken any of
ten named recreational drugs in the previous 4 weeks (mari-
juana, ecstasy, LSD, amphetamine, crystal methamphetamine,
cocaine, crack cocaine, ketamine, GHB, heroin, inhaled nitrites,
erectile dysfunction medications, tranquillisers).
Age, education, ethnicity, migrant status, income, house-
hold situation and geography were analysed for their associa-
tions with health outcomes. These variables were selected on
their basis of their mention within the Public Health England
Outcomes Framework LGBT Companion Document.1 Ages
were coded in four bands giving approximately equal sized
groups (16–25; 26–35; 36–45; .45). Educational attain-
ment was coded in three groups: to General Certificate of
Education (GCSE) or less; post-GCSE qualifications but not
a degree; university degree. Ethnicity was recoded as ‘White’,
‘Black’, ‘Asian’ and ‘Other ethnicity’, from the Office for
National Statistics 18 category ethnicity question. Migrant
status was coded according to whether or not respondents
reported having been born outside of the UK. Income was
coded into five bands giving approximately similar sized
groups. Household indicates who the respondent lived with
(alone, with a male partner, with others but not a male
partner). Finally, respondents were assigned to one of two geo-
graphical groupings: living in London or not living in London.
Model development
We first investigated and reported data missingness, and used
cross-tabulation and logistic regression to explore unadjusted
trends between each demographic and the health outcomes.
Associations were described as odds ratios, with strength of
association measured by effect size (P-value from a likelihood
ratio test). The associations under investigation were liable to
confounding, and in order to select appropriate potential con-
founders, and to make explicit our assumptions about the
causal connections between the variables, we drew a directed
acyclical graph (Fig. 1). The graph states our assumptions and
was developed by the authors. We used the DAGITTY soft-
ware (http://www.dagitty.net/) to identify minimal sufficient
adjustment sets of potential confounders. These confounders
were used in logistic regression. By identifying confounders in
this way, as opposed to including potential confounders on
the basis of association with the exposure of interest and the
outcome, we aimed to avoid over-fitting the model with vari-
ables on the causal pathway.11
The arrows represent assumed causal links. Education and
migration status are both determined in the ‘past’ and

 therefore have been placed higher in the causal pathways.
Each of these variables is also thought to have a causal rela-
tionship with the outcomes (data not shown).
Figure 1 indicates that we assumed some demographics
were intermediate on the causal pathway between other vari-
ables and the outcomes. For each adjusted logistic regression
model estimating the association between a particular demo-
graphic and a particular outcome, we reported whether or not
variables assumed to be on the causal pathway substantially
changed the association when added to the model. This was
not a formal assessment of mediation in order to make causal
claims, but a description of the associations in the sample.
When the odds ratio was substantially altered (i.e. by above
10%) by the inclusion of a potential mediator, we described
the variable as having at least partially altered the association.
Results
After ineligibility exclusions, there were 5799 valid survey sub-
missions. From the original sample of 7160, 1361 cases were
excluded. As this paper focusses specifically on England,
1257 men who lived in Scotland or Wales or provided no evi-
dence of living in England were excluded. A further 112 gave
no evidence of sex with men or a gay, bisexual or queer iden-
tity, 66 were duplicates, 60 gave no evidence of being aged 16
or above, 35 expressed a female gender identity and 7 gave
very inconsistent answers deemed to be nonsensical. Some of
these cases overlapped on exclusion criteria. Table 1 presents
a description of the sample and results of the logistic
regression.
The median age was 32 years with the majority (78%)
under 45 years. Most were White (94%) and 58% had degree-
level education. There was a broad distribution of incomes
and 14% were migrants. Approximately equal numbers
reported living alone, living with a male partner or living with
others (not a male partner); 35% lived in London. In the
adjusted models: associations with ethnicity were adjusted by
age, geography and migrant status; education was adjusted
by age, ethnicity and living in London; income was adjusted
by age, ethnicity, education, migrant status and living in
London; household was adjusted by age, ethnicity, education,
migrant status and living in London; migrant status was
adjusted by age; and associations with living in London were
adjusted for age and migrant status.
Overweight
Overall, 44% of the men were overweight. The proportion
overweight increased successively with age. There was strong
statistical evidence for an association (P , 0.001) and large
effect sizes relative to the youngest group: men aged over 45
were more than twice as likely to be overweight relative to
those under 25 (percentage overweight aged .45 ¼ 57%,
16–25 ¼ 25%; OR ¼ 4.08; 95% CI: 3.47–4.80). The effect
of age was not changed by adjusting for migration status or
household living arrangement; adjusting for income, educa-
tion and living in London moderately shifted the effect esti-
mates away from the null. This suggested that the effect of
age might be slightly weakened because of its intermediate
effect on these factors. There was strong evidence of an asso-
ciation between increasing level of education and a lower risk
of being overweight (P , 0.001), with the strongest effect for
the high education category relative to the low category (aOR
degree ¼ 0.74 95%; CI 0.63–0.87). Adjusting for other po-
tentially mediating variables did not change the estimated
effect. We found moderate evidence that migrant status was
associated with lower risk of being overweight
(aOR
migrant ¼ 0.82; 95% CI 0.70–0.96), but that this was strong-
ly altered by adjusting for living in London so that the aOR
was 0.93, and the P-value became 0.40.
Low exercise
The majority, 61.6%, were physically active (for 30 min or
more) on fewer than 5 days per week. There was no evidence
of an association with increasing age (P ¼ 0.390). Men of
Asian ethnicity were less likely to exercise relative to White
men, and there was moderate evidence for the association
(aOR ¼ 2.02; 95% CI 1.25–3.26; P-value overall ¼ 0.009).
This association was not altered by adjustment for education
(aOR Asianjeducation ¼ 2.04) or income (aOR Asianj1.94
income). Education was not associated with low exercise.
There was no evidence that migrants exercised more or less
than non-migrants, while living in London was associated with
a modest protective effect (aOR ¼ 0.89; 95% CI 0.79–1.00).
Frequent alcohol
Over 43% drank on 4 or more days in the last week. The pro-
portion was lowest in the 16–35 year olds and highest for men

Column frequencies are shown for the complete dataset. Row frequencies exclude missing data. The adjusted analyses were informed by the causal diagram. The associations with ethnicity were adjusted by age, geography and migrant status. The associations with
education were adjusted by age, ethnicity and living in London. The associations with income were adjusted for by age, ethnicity, education, migrant status and living in London. The associations with household living arrangement were adjusted by age, ethnicity,
education, migrant status and living in London. The associations with migrant status were adjusted by age. The associations with living in London were adjusted for age and migrant status; P-values were calculated using likelihood ratio tests.

 over 45 years. The association between age and frequent alcohol
intake was strong, with substantial effect sizes. Some of this as-
sociation was altered by adjusting for income (aORjincome:
25–35 ¼ 1.12; 36–45 ¼ 1.41; .45 ¼ 1.77). There was mod-
erate evidence that frequent alcohol increases with income, and
strong evidence of association with living in London (aOR
living in London 1.24; 95% CI 1.11–1.39; P , 0.001). The
effect of living in London was very slightly moved towards the
null when adjusting for income (aORjincome ¼ 1.21), but not
by other variables, suggesting that some of the effect is because
of geographical income differences, but that there are independ-
ent effects on drinking behaviour.
Smoking
Approximately, 25% currently smoked tobacco. This proportion
was highest in men aged 16–25 (30%), successively lower with
increasing age and lowest in men .45 (15%). The age effect was
only altered by adjustment for income, and there were substantial
residual effects, especially for older ages relative to 16–25 year
olds (aORjincome: 25–35 ¼ 1.09; 36–45 ¼ 0.96; .45 ¼
0.49). Higher education was associated with not smoking (aOR:
A-level ¼ 0.91; Degree ¼ 0.66), and this moved somewhat
towards the null when adjusting by income (aORjincome:
A-level ¼ 0.97; Degree ¼ 0.73). There was a strong association
between lower income and smoking (P , 0.001).
Illicit drug use
Approximately, 19% had used an illicit drug in the previous 4
weeks. This proportion was lower in men aged 16–25 (16%)
and in men over 45 (11%). Relative to the youngest age group
there was increased likelihood of drug use in middle age groups
(26–35 years, OR ¼ 1.96; 95% CI 1.65–2.34; 36–45 years,
OR ¼ 1.48; 95% CI 1.22–1.79) and lower likelihood in men
aged .45 (OR ¼ 0.64; 95% CI 0.51–0.80). These odds
ratios moved towards the null when adjusted for income
(aORjincome: 25–35 ¼ 1.71; 36–45 ¼ 0.24; .45 ¼ 0.54) or
living in London (aORjLondon: 25–35 ¼ 1.60; 36–45 ¼ 0.26;
.45 ¼ 0.54). There was strong evidence that men living in
London had over twice the odds of illicit drug use in the previ-
ous year, with no evidence of mediation by other variables.
Discussion
Main findings of this study
The findings of the survey indicate widespread problematic
behaviours connected with physical ill health among gay and bi-
sexual men in England: 44% of respondents were overweight;
62% do not meet recommended levels of physical activity; 43%
were very frequent drinkers; 26% currently smoked; and 19%
used illicit drugs within the previous 4 weeks. Among all UK
adult males in the same time period (and utilizing the same
operational definitions), 66% had a BMI over 2512 and 61% had
low activity,6 suggesting these sexual minority men had less over-
weightness and comparable physical activity to the sexual major-
ity. However, the substance use figures were higher than
comparable measures for all adult males in similar times periods,
where 24% were very frequent drinkers,13 21% smoked14 and
12% used illicit drugs.8 This suggests that male health inequal-
ities across sexuality do not all trend in the same direction.
Our analysis found heterogeneous associations between
demographic factors and different health indicators in this
sample. We identified that older gay and bisexual men were sig-
nificantly more likely to be overweight and drink frequently but
were less likely to smoke or use illicit drugs than younger men.
As in the general male population,14 younger men were most
likely to smoke, with only a slow falling off until the over 45 s
when the decline is steeper. However, illicit drug use was most
common in men aged 25–45 years. Only a small proportion of
this association was accounted for by living in London.
In this survey, differences in health outcomes by ethnicity
were difficult to detect because of the small numbers of men
from specific minority ethnicities. However, Asian men were
less likely to take exercise than White men, and that this was
not due to differences in education or income. An association
between physical inactivity and Asian ethnicity has also been
documented in the general population.15 However, Asian men
were also significantly less likely to smoke. In the Health Survey
for England 200416 Indian men were less likely to smoke
(20%) than the general population (24%) but Pakistani men
(29%) and especially Bangladeshi men (40%) were more likely
to smoke. Our data do not allow for this level of enquiry.
We found that lower education was associated with being
overweight, inactivity, smoking and frequent alcohol use, and
that these associations were only slightly mediated by differ-
ences in income. Illicit drug use, however, was mildly associated
with higher levels of education, after adjusting for potential
confounders. Higher earners were more likely to drink fre-
quently but much less likely to smoke, mirroring biases in the
general population.17 In both cases, the effects were progressive
with increasing income. Income was not associated with being
overweight, exercise or illicit drug use after adjusting for con-
founders. Migrants were less likely to be overweight, which was
mediated by living in London, and were more likely to exercise
frequently, which was independent of living in London.
After controlling for potential confounders, household was
not strongly associated with any of the health outcomes, but
smoking was slightly less common among men co-habiting
with a male partner, which reflects the general population
where smoking is less common in married rather than single
people.17 Living in London was strongly associated with a
lower risk of being overweight, and this was not mediated by

 education, income or any other available factor. Men in
London were more likely to drink frequently, and considerably
more likely to have used illicit drugs than those living elsewhere.
However, as in the general population,14 living in London did
not change the likelihood of tobacco use.
What this study adds
Our findings contribute a clear, nuanced account of demo-
graphic variation in health-related behaviours among gay and bi-
sexual living in England that did not previously exist. That many
of these findings mirror those observed among the general
population is valuable to document in the context of public
health policy or discussion which has often tended to consider
minority groups more homogenous than they actually are.18
The concept of ‘intersectionality’ provides a useful way of
interpreting these findings.19 Applied to gay and bisexual men,
intersectionality suggests that the impact of homophobia on
health is not felt equally, and further that the negative effect of
homophobia may operate differently, and be more or less
resisted, exacerbated or mitigated, by membership of other
groups. It is possible that the negative health impact of being in
a sexual minority can be mitigated by being relatively privileged
in other areas of life. There is also a danger that interventions
targeted at sexual minorities are least accessed by those margin-
alized in other ways, such that interventions reinforce health in-
equalities along lines of ethnicity, education, income and age
for example. While this study has identified diversity according
to key demographic characteristics, further qualitative research
is required to understand the nature of such health-related be-
haviour and the reasons why such divergence may exist.
Limitations of this study
While large, this remains a non-representative self-selecting
sample of gay and bisexual men. Due to the mode of online
completion we are unable to establish a response rate for the
survey. Despite controlling for confounders, there may be re-
sidual confounding unmeasured factors. The alcohol measure
may not reflect the quantity consumed and therefore alcohol-
related harm. There is imprecision involved in short self-
completion measures of health states.
