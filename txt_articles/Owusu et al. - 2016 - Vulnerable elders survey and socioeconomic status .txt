BACKGROUND: The purpose of this study was to determine the ability of the Vulnerable Elders Survey (VES-13) to predict the com-
posite outcome of functional decline and death within 12 months of breast cancer treatment among women 65 years old or older
with newly diagnosed stage I to III breast cancer. METHODS: Two hundred and six participants were recruited from ambulatory oncol-
ogy clinics at an academic center between April 2008 and April 2013. Participants competed the VES-13 at baseline just before neo-
adjuvant/adjuvant treatment. The primary outcome, functional decline/death, was defined as either a decrease of at least 1 point on
the Activities of Daily Living scale and/or the Instrumental Activities of Daily Living scale or death between baseline and 12 months
(yes or no). RESULTS: One hundred and eighty four participants (89%) completed 12 months of follow-up. Twenty-two percent func-
tionally declined (n 5 34) or died (n 5 7). Univariately, with increasing VES-13 scores, the estimated risk of functional decline/death
rose from 23% for participants with a VES-13 score of 3 to 76% for participants with a VES-13 score of 10. In multivariate logistic
regression analysis, VES-13 scores (adjusted odds ratio, 1.37; 95% confidence interval, 1.18-1.57) and having a high school education or
less (adjusted odds ratio, 2.47; 95% confidence interval, 1.08-5.65) were independent predictors of functional decline/death (area
under the receiver operator curve, 0.79). CONCLUSIONS: Among older women with newly diagnosed nonmetastatic breast cancer,
approximately 1 in 5 functionally declined and/or died within 12 months of breast cancer treatment initiation. Women with high school
education or less were disproportionately affected. The VES-13 is a useful instrument for the early identification of those at risk for
functional decline and/or death. Cancer 2016;122:2579-86. V

INTRODUCTION
Compared with non-Hispanic whites (NHWs), African Americans (AAs) are overburdened with many chronic diseases,
including functional disability.1-3 Functional disability is the inability to independently complete activities of daily living.
Furthermore, functional decline, defined as the transition over time to a more functionally dependent state, dispropor-
tionately affects AAs and persons of lower socioeconomic status (SES).4,5
Functional status is a key summary measure of health.6 Functional status predicts many outcomes in older persons,
including total mortality,7 mortality among hospitalized patients,8 recovery from intensive care,9 and tolerance to cancer
treatment.10 Functional disability and decline result in a huge financial burden for the individual and society at large. The
added costs of health care for the subset of older adults who functionally decline are estimated at $26 billion per year in
the United States, just less than one-tenth of the total cost of health care for all persons who are 65 years old or older.11,12
Therefore, the prevention of functional disability and decline could be significant with potential benefits at both the indi-
vidual level and the societal level, and it could potentially improve overall survival for those particularly at risk.
The Vulnerable Elders Survey (VES-13) is a 13-item, self-administered tool that has been validated in community-
dwelling elders to predict functional decline or death at 12 months.13-15 Using the Medicare Current Beneficiary Survey, Sal-
iba et al14 found that community-dwelling elders with a VES-13 score of 3 were 4 times more likely to functionally decline
and die at 2 years than their counterparts with scores < 3. These findings were subsequently validated in prospective cohort
studies.13,16 Patients with cancer who were undergoing treatment were excluded from these studies. Therefore, it remains

 unclear whether the VES-13 could be useful for predicting
functional decline among cancer patients undergoing active
treatment and during the early survivorship period when
the opportunity exists to intervene before functional dis-
ability/decline becomes firmly established.
In light of this existing gap, we sought to examine
the utility of the VES-13 in predicting functional decline
among older women with newly diagnosed nonmetastatic
breast cancer. This information is clinically relevant for
cancer treatment decision making and for informing
interventions aimed at preventing functional decline
among older breast cancer survivors.
MATERIALS AND METHODS
Study Design and Patient Population
This is a longitudinal study of patients, 65 years old or
older, with newly diagnosed, histologically confirmed
stage I to III breast cancer who were recruited from ambu-
latory oncology clinics at an academic center between
April 1, 2008 and April 31, 2013. Exclusionary criteria
included the receipt of chemotherapy, hormonal or tar-
geted therapy, or breast irradiation before enrollment for
the current diagnosis of breast cancer. Receipt of breast
surgery before enrollment was allowed. AAs were over-
sampled. Our rationale for oversampling AAs was based
on existing literature for the general population showing
that AAs were more likely to suffer from many chronic
diseases, including functional disability. We had to over-
sample and enroll an adequate number of AAs to allow us
to examine racial differences in functional outcomes. For
that reason, we decided a priori that at least 30% of en-
rolled patients would be AA and, therefore, enrolled 1 AA
for every 2 NHWs. The study was approved by the insti-
tutional review board.
Study Procedures and Data Collection
Potentially eligible patients were identified from weekly
multidisciplinary breast cancer conferences and then were
approached for informed consent by a trained research as-
sistant during each patient’s initial visit with a medical or
radiation
oncologist.
The
Comprehensive
Geriatric
Assessment (CGA), which included a functional assess-
ment, was completed by consenting patients at baseline
and 6 and 12 months after study enrollment.
Measures
Functional assessment
The VES-13 asks older patients to report their age by cate-
gory (65-74, 75-84, or �85 years), self-rated health (excel-
lent, very good, good, fair, or poor), functional limitations
([1] stooping, crouching, or kneeling, [2] lifting or carrying
heavy objects, [3] writing or grasping small objects, [4]
walking a quarter of a mile, and [5] doing heavy house-
work), and functional disabilities ([1] shopping for perso-
nal items, [2] managing money, [3] walking across a room,
[4] doing light housework, and [5] bathing or shower-
ing).13-15 The maximum score is 10, and increasing scores
denote an increasing risk of functional decline.
The Katz Activities of Daily Living (ADL) scale and
the Lawton Instrumental Activities of Daily Living
(IADL) scale were used to evaluate self-reported func-
tional status at baseline and at 6 and 12 months. The
ADL scale measures skills necessary to live independently
at home, such as bathing, transferring, and dressing,17
and the IADL scale measures skills required for living in-
dependently in the community, such as the ability to use
the telephone, medication management, housekeeping,
transportation, the ability to manage finances, and meal
preparation.18 The maximum scores for the ADL and
IADL scales are 6 and 8, respectively, with increasing
scores denoting better functional status.
Comorbidities
Medical records were abstracted to obtain data on comor-
bidities at baseline. These data were supplemented by self-
reports of medical problems by participants. Using the list
of comorbidities, we derived the Charlson comorbidity
index score,19 which is based on the presence of 18 medi-
cal conditions.
Sociodemographic and other variables
Sociodemographic variables were captured at baseline with
a self-administered questionnaire. Data on the median
household income were obtained from the US Census Bu-
reau Website20; participants’ zip codes for their place of res-
idence at the time of enrollment were used. Height was
measured to the nearest 0.1 cm, and weight was measured
to the nearest 0.01 kg to compute the body mass index.
Medical records were abstracted to obtain data on tumor
characteristics and cancer treatments received.
Analytic variables
Primary outcome variable:
The primary outcome was a
composite outcome of functional decline and death
within 12 months of study enrollment. Functional decline
was defined as a decrease in at least 1 point on the ADL
scale and/or IADL scale from baseline to 12 months (yes
or no).21,22 Death was considered the most extreme mani-
festation of functional decline, and this was the rationale

 for its inclusion in the outcome.22 Death status was deter-
mined from institutional tumor registry records.
Functional status, which is measured by an individu-
al’s ability to perform activities of daily living/instrumen-
tal activities of daily living, is a key summary measure of
the health status of an individual.6 A deterioration in
functional status (a decrease in the ADL score and/or
IADL score) is a well-established approach for capturing
and defining functional decline, and this is the rationale
for our approach.
Independent variable:
The independent variable was
the VES-13 score at the baseline analyzed as a continuous
variable.
Explanatory variables:
Explanatory variables included
age (65-74 or �75 years), race (AA or NHW), marital sta-
tus (married or other), educational status (�high school
or >high school), median household income (dichotom-
ized as <$35,000 [lowest quartile] or �$35,000), living
situation (alone or other), health insurance carrier (Medi-
care or other), body mass index (<25 or �25 kg/m2),
stage (I-II or III), receipt of chemotherapy (yes or no),
receipt of hormone therapy (yes or no), and comorbidity
(Charlson comorbidity index score of 0-1 or �2).
Data Analysis
We excluded from the analyses participants who did not
complete follow-up even though they had not died (n 5
22). We compared participants’ baseline characteristics
between the 2 groups (functional decline/death vs no
functional decline/death) with independent t tests for
continuous variables and with chi-square/Fisher exact
tests for categorical variables. We also examined differen-
ces in VES-13 and ADL/IADL scores between groups
with the Kruskal-Wallis test. Using univariate logistic
regression with functional decline/death (yes vs no) as an
outcome variable, we identified explanatory variables that
had univariate associations with functional decline/death
(P < .10). Our final model used a backward multiple
logistic regression method with the same outcome variable
and explanatory variables from the univariate logistic
regression analysis that were associated with functional
decline/death. Because of collinearity between baseline
VES-13 scores and ADL/IADL scores, we did not include
baseline ADL/IADL scores in regression models. Interac-
tions between variables in the final model were examined.
We created the receiver operating characteristic (ROC)
curve for the final model with the estimated area under
the ROC curve. Ordinal logistic regression was used to
obtain the probabilities of death and the probabilities of
death or functional decline according to VES-13 scores.
Sensitivity analysis were conducted with functional
decline only as an outcome. We did not examine death only
as an outcome because the number of deaths was only 7.
All P values presented are 2-sided. All analyses were
conducted with SAS 9.4 (SAS Institute, Cary, NC).
RESULTS
The study flow chart is depicted in Figure 1. Six hundred
and fourteen patients who were 65 years old or older were
screened for study participation; we identified 534 (87%)
as being potentially eligible and approached 267 (50%)
for informed consent. Of those approached, 206 (77%)
agreed to study participation, and 61 (23%) declined
study participation. The only patient factor that was sig-
nificantly different between those who were approached
for consent and those who were not was race, with AAs
being more likely to be approached for consent in com-
parison with NHWs (65% vs 44%, P 5 .0005). This was
because our strategy was to oversample AAs. Among

 patients who were approached, there was no statistically
significant difference between consenters and noncon-
senters by race (27% for AAs vs 33% for NHWs, P 5 .40)
or by age group (28% for <75 years vs 34% for �75
years, P 5 .40).
The reasons that approximately 50% of potentially
eligible patients were not approached included the follow-
ing: ineligibility (39%), an inability to reach the patient
due to the ambulatory clinic not being within a 20-mile
radius of the main academic center and/or the occurrence
of simultaneous office visits by multiple patients at the
same time at different locations (42%), a physician’s
request not to approach the patient (3%), medical ill-
nesses precluding study participation (6%), and a failure
to follow-up with a medical or radiation oncologist after
primary breast surgery (10%).
Of the 206 patients enrolled, 22 (11%) did not com-
plete the follow-up assessments at 12 months (7 with-
drew, and 15 were lost to follow-up), and they were
excluded from these analyses. Compared with participants
not lost to follow-up, participants lost to follow-up were
less likely to be married (14% vs 38%, P 5 .05) and to
have received chemotherapy (5% vs 26%, P 5 .05).
Participants’ Baseline Characteristics
The median duration from diagnosis to baseline assessment
was 2.1 months (interquartile range, 1.2-3.0 months). The
median duration of follow-up was 12.1 months (interquar-
tile range, 11.6-12.7 months). The cohort had a mean age of
74.9 years (range, 65-93 years) and a mean baseline VES-13
score of 2.3 (standard deviation, 2.7), 25% had ADL disabil-
ity, 31% had IADL disability, 33% were AA, and 44% had
high school education or less.
Participants’ Baseline Characteristics According
to the Functional Decline/Death Status
Table 1 displays baseline characteristics by functional
decline/death. Twenty-two percent of participants (n 5
41) functionally declined (n 5 34) or died (n 5 7), and
143 participants had no functional decline or did not die.
With respect to the trajectory of functional status, 19%,
67%, and 14% of the participants declined, remained sta-
ble, or improved, respectively, from baseline to 12
months. The mean baseline VES-13 scores for partici-
pants who functionally declined or died and those who
did not functionally decline or die were 4.4 (standard
deviation, 3.2) and 1.7 (standard deviation, 2.1), respec-
tively (P < .0001). In addition, in comparison with par-
ticipants who did not functionally decline or die,
participants who did were more likely to have lower

Predictors of Functional Decline or Death
at 12 Months
Using univariate logistic regression with functional
decline/death (yes vs no) as an outcome variable, we found
that 9 explanatory variables (baseline VES-13 score, age,
race, education, marital status, median household income,
Charlson comorbidity index, stage, and surgery) had uni-
variate associations with functional decline/death (P <
.10; see Table 2). Using backward multiple logistic regres-
sion with the same outcome and the 8 explanatory varia-
bles from the univariate logistic regression analysis, we
found that baseline VES-13 score and educational status
were the only significant independent predictors of func-
tional decline/death at 12 months (Table 3). The odds of
functional decline/death were multiplied by 1.37 for each
1-point increase in VES-13 score (adjusted odds ratio,
1.37; 95% confidence interval, 1.18-1.57), and partici-
pants with high school education or less versus those with
more than high school education had 2.5 times higher
odds of functionally declining/dying (adjusted odds ratio,
2.47; 95% confidence interval, 1.08-5.65). The area
under the ROC curve was 0.79 (95% confidence interval,
0.71-0.87; see Fig. 2).

 The univariate associations between VES-13 scores
and the predicted probabilities of death, and of death or
functional decline over the 12-month follow-up period,
estimated from the ordinal logistic regression, are depicted
in Figure 3. For participants with a VES-13 score of 3, the
predicted probabilities of death, and of death or functional
decline in the next 12 months were 0.04 and 0.23, respec-
tively. With increasing scores, the probabilities increased,
so that at a VES-13 score of 10, the predicted probabilities
of death, and of functional decline or death in the next 12
months were 0.24 and 0.76, respectively.
Multivariate analyses with functional decline only as
the outcome of interest showed similar results (data not
shown). The odds of functional decline versus none were
multiplied by 1.43 for each 1-point increase in the VES-
13 score (odds ratio, 1.43; 95% confidence interval, 1.24-
1.64). The area under the ROC curve was 0.75 (95% con-
fidence interval, 0.65-0.85). Educational status was no
longer significantly associated with functional decline at
12 months (P 5 .10), and VES-13 remained the only in-
dependent significant predictor of functional decline.
DISCUSSION
Among older women with newly diagnosed stage I to III
breast cancer, approximately 1 in 5 functionally declined or
died within 12 months of initiation of their treatment for
breast cancer. The VES-13 was a useful instrument for pre-
dicting functional decline. Notably, the study identified
VES-13 scores and educational status as the only independ-
ent predictive factors associated with functional decline/
death within 12 months of treatment initiation.
The VES-13 is a well-established instrument and has
been validated among older adults in general as a useful
instrument for predicting functional decline and death.
Our study extends the utility of the VES-13 survey to
newly diagnosed older breast cancer patients undergoing
active treatment for cancer, a population that was
excluded in prior validation studies. It is remarkable that
the magnitude of the predictive properties of the VES-13
found in our study were nearly identical to the results
found by Min et al13,16 in their validation studies among
the general older adult population. This attests to the va-
lidity of the VES-13 in predicting functional decline,
regardless of the patient population. Several small studies
and a few large studies have also examined the VES-13 in
the geriatric oncology population for its utility in screen-
ing and identifying patients who will benefit from a full
CGA or completely eliminating the need for the CGA.23-
25 Consistently, these studies have demonstrated that the
VES-13 is not a perfect screening instrument, nor can it
substitute for the CGA. This is not surprising because the
VES-13 was never developed nor was it validated to
replace the CGA. Used as intended and developed, it is a
robust and consistent instrument for predicting func-
tional decline and death, regardless of patient population.
Because of the importance of functional status in predict-
ing cancer treatment tolerance and on the basis of results
from emerging studies,26 it is conceivable that the VES-13
might serve as a useful instrument for predicting chemo-
therapy toxicity and tolerance to cancer treatment.
The significant association between SES and func-
tional decline found in our study deserves comment. This
finding is consistent with the existing literature, which has
demonstrated racial and SES-related disparities in func-
tional and health status in the United States, with racial
minorities and persons with lower SES persistently exhib-
iting a poorer health status and higher rates of functional
disability/decline and mortality.1,4,5 Our recent work,
which evaluated the baseline cross-sectional relation
between patient characteristics and functional status in
older women with breast cancer and which was published
in Cancer in 2013,27 demonstrated that compared with
NHWs, AAs were 4 times more likely to have functional
disability at initial diagnosis of breast cancer. Lower SES
explained 59% of the racial disparity in functional disabil-
ity at diagnosis. Specifically, in that study, older women

 our findings by demonstrating that SES-related disparities
in functional status persist with longitudinal follow-up
and that once again socioeconomic differences account
for disparities in functional decline.
Breast cancer survival rates among older AA women
continue to lag behind survival rates among older NHWs.28
A recent Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results-
Medicare database analysis of more than 28,000 older
women with breast cancer suggests that the racial disparity in
breast cancer survival among older women is partly due to
the poorer health status of older AAs (vs NHWs) at the breast
cancer diagnosis.29 This poorer health status is hypothesized
to blunt the long-term survival benefit derived from cancer
treatment.29 It is unfortunate but not surprising that once
again older AAs and women of lower SES are disproportion-
ately affected by functional disability and decline, a key sum-
mary measure of health.6 This speaks to the general poor
health of these 2 patient populations and may partly explain
the poorer breast cancer outcomes experienced by AAs and
women of lower SES. It is, therefore, imperative for efforts to
be developed and focused on improving the functional health
of at-risk populations; otherwise, racial and SES-related dis-
parities will only widen. Such efforts in the long term may
improve treatment tolerance and functional and overall
health and ultimately translate into improved breast cancer
survival for older AAs and women of lower SES.
Many studies have demonstrated the benefits of
increased physical activity. Specifically, older
adults
engaged in 150 minutes of moderate-intensity aerobic exer-
cise per week, as recommended by the US Department of
Health and Human Services,30 can reduce the risk of func-
tional limitations by up to 50%.31 In addition, regular
physical activity after breast cancer diagnosis is associated
with improved breast cancer-specific and overall sur-
vival.32,33 A meta-analysis of more than 12,000 women
with breast cancer showed that postdiagnosis physical activ-
ity reduced breast cancer mortality by 34% and all-cause
mortality by 41%.34 Despite these and many other health
benefits, only approximately 50% of Americans engage in
the recommended amount of physical activity.35 Rates of
physical inactivity are particularly high among older AA
breast cancer survivors,36,37 the very population dispropor-
tionately affected by obesity and functional disability/
decline. Promotion of healthy behaviors is, therefore, criti-
cal to addressing health disparities among these popula-
tions. Physical activity studies involving older AA breast
cancer survivors and lower SES breast cancer survivors, 2
groups that are particularly vulnerable to functional disabil-
ity/decline,38,39 are lacking, have been identified as a critical
research need,40 and are, therefore, warranted.
Our study had several limitations. The cohort was en-
rolled from a single academic institution. Therefore, the
results may not be generalizable. However, the consistency
of our results with the original VES-13 validation studies
suggests otherwise. Deaths were ascertained from a tumor
registry rather than a more centralized database such as the
National Death Index. However, because this was a single-
institution study, we were able to rely on tumor registry
results. The duration of treatment and recurrences, though
rare in the first year of diagnosis, could have had an impact
on functional status. However, our study did not account
for treatment duration or recurrences in the analysis. De-
spite these limitations, the results are consistent with exist-
ing literature, and this suggests that our results are robust.
In conclusion, among older women with newly diag-
nosed stage I to III breast cancer, approximately 1 in 5
functionally declined or died within 12 months of treat-
ment initiation. Women with high school education or less
were disproportionately affected. The VES-13 is a useful
instrument for the early identification of those at risk for
functional decline/death among older women with breast
cancer. Use of the VES-13, a patient self-administered
instrument that takes only 4 minutes to complete, should
be encouraged for the early identification of those at risk.
Behavioral research and efforts to ameliorate functional dis-
ability and decline among older women with breast cancer
are warranted for all but particularly for older African
American and women of lower SES. Such efforts may in
the long term translate into improved treatment tolerance
and better breast cancer outcomes.
