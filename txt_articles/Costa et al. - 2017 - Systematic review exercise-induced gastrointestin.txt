Summary
Background: “Exercise-induced gastrointestinal syndrome” refers to disturbances of
gastrointestinal integrity and function that are common features of strenuous
exercise.
Aim: To systematically review the literature to establish the impact of acute exer-
cise on markers of gastrointestinal integrity and function in healthy populations and
those with chronic gastrointestinal conditions.
Methods: Search literature using five databases (PubMed, EBSCO, Web of Science,
SPORTSdiscus, and Ovid Medline) to review publications that focused on the impact
of acute exercise on markers of gastrointestinal injury, permeability, endotoxaemia,
motility and malabsorption in healthy populations and populations with gastroin-
testinal diseases/disorders.
Results: As exercise intensity and duration increases, there is considerable evidence
for increases in indices of intestinal injury, permeability and endotoxaemia, together
with impairment of gastric emptying, slowing of small intestinal transit and malab-
sorption. The addition of heat stress and running mode appears to exacerbate these
markers of gastrointestinal disturbance. Exercise stress of ≥2 hours at 60% VO2max
appears to be the threshold whereby significant gastrointestinal perturbations mani-
fest, irrespective of fitness status. Gastrointestinal symptoms, referable to upper-
and lower-gastrointestinal tract, are common and a limiting factor in prolonged
strenuous exercise. While there is evidence for health benefits of moderate exercise
in patients with inflammatory bowel disease or functional gastrointestinal disorders,
the safety of more strenuous exercise has not been established.
Conclusions: Strenuous exercise has a major reversible impact on gastrointestinal
integrity and function of healthy populations. The safety and health implications of
prolonged strenuous exercise in patients with chronic gastrointestinal diseases/dis-
orders, while hypothetically worrying, has not been elucidated and requires further
investigation.

INTRODUCTION
It is well established that exercise has beneficial effects for human
health, especially in regards to musculoskeletal and cardiovascular
health.1 As such, exercise is readily promoted within public health
policy, which has led to a plethora of public health initiatives, both

 internationally and nationally to cater for cultural differences.2-4
Despite light exercise (eg, walking) being advocated for general well-
being, the scientific literature clearly shows that moderate (3.0-5.9
metabolic equivalents (METs), which refers to the energy cost of
physical activity in comparison to resting metabolic rate [ie, 1 MET])
to vigorous (≥6 METs) intensity exercise of substantial duration (eg,
≥1 hours) is required to provide a sufficient magnitude of physiologi-
cal and metabolic strain to promote musculoskeletal and cardiovas-
cular
adaptations
associated
with
improved
health.5,6
Although
exercise is beneficial to the prevention and management of non-
communicable diseases, substantial exposure to exercise stress may
not be suitable or may exacerbate other medical conditions, espe-
cially of the gastrointestinal tract. Indeed, evidence has shown that
even moderate intensity exercise of short duration has the ability to
compromise the gastrointestinal tract and promote occurrence of
gastrointestinal symptoms.7,8
Recently, there has been a substantial amount of research inves-
tigating the causal mechanisms for the perturbations to gastrointesti-
nal integrity, function and symptoms induced by exercise.8-12 The
majority of research, however, has recruited healthy endurance-
trained populations, with limited research being conducted on indi-
viduals presenting with gastrointestinal diseases/disorders, such as
inflammatory bowel disease (IBD), functional gastrointestinal disor-
ders (FGID) and gastro-oesophageal reflux disease. Moreover, the
exponential growth of participation in endurance and ultra-endur-
ance events over the last decade in the general population,13 and
the
high reported incidence of
gastrointestinal
issues in
such
events,14-16 has raised concerns regarding the impact of prolonged
strenuous exercise on gastrointestinal health. Concerns have also
been raised in regards to implications for acute and/or chronic medi-
cal complications including, and not limited to, septic shock, colitis,
paralytic ileus, ischaemic bowel, and the development or progression
of IBD and/or FGID in individuals with pre-disposition or presenting
such conditions, respectively.
Previous reviews have focused on the impact of exercise stress
on splanchnic blood flow and subsequent intestinal ischaemia and
symptomatology,8 cytokine responses,17 gastrointestinal motility and
absorption.11,18 There is, however, a need to more comprehensively
integrate the evidence for all elements of exercise-associated gas-
trointestinal disturbances. With this in mind, the aims of this review
are, first, to explore the concept of “exercise-induced gastrointestinal
syndrome”. Second, to conduct a systematic review on the impact of
acute exercise intensity and duration on markers of gastrointestinal
integrity and function; and third, to review the current literature on
gastrointestinal perturbation in populations with gastrointestinal dis-
eases/disorders under exercise conditions.

EXERCISE-INDUCED
GASTROINTESTINAL SYNDROME
The term, “exercise-induced gastrointestinal syndrome”, has recently
been introduced to describe a complex array of normal physiological
responses to exercise that perturbs and compromises gastrointestinal
integrity and function.14,19 As shown in Figure 1, responses are dri-
ven down two primary pathways: (1) a circulatory-gastrointestinal
pathway involving redistribution of blood flow to working muscle
and peripheral circulation, which aids skeletal muscle metabolism and
thermoregulation,
subsequently
reducing
total
splanchnic
perfu-
sion;12,20 and (2) a neuroendocrine-gastrointestinal pathway involv-
ing
an
increase
in
sympathetic
activation,
reducing
overall
gastrointestinal functional capacity.11 The combination of splanchnic
hypoperfusion and altered enteric nervous system activity leads to a
cascade of events that may result in gastrointestinal symptoms, and/
or acute or chronic health complications.
One key feature of splanchnic hypoperfusion is intestinal ischae-
mia.8,20 Indeed, at the onset of steady-state exercise, portal blood
flow has been reported to decrease by 20% within 10 minutes, and
by 80% after 1 hour of running at 70% of maximal oxygen update
(VO2max).21 While, 1 hour of cycling at 70% of maximal wattage out-
put (Wmax) resulted in a 1.7 kPa increase in gastric arterialised PCO2,
indicative
of
splanchnic
ischaemia,
with
the
most
pronounced
increase occurring within the first 10 minutes of exercise, and a
return to baseline levels 1 hour after exercise.20 Such profound
ischaemia creates epithelial injury associated with apical erosion and
likely dysfunction of all epithelial cell types (ie, enterocyte, goblet,
Paneth and enteroendocrine cells).9,12,22 A major consequence of
such damage is increased intestinal permeability, by either, physical
breaks in the epithelium, damaging the multi-protein complex (ie,
claudins and occludin) of the tight-junction and/or promoting dys-
function to tight-junction regulatory proteins (ie, zona-occludens).23
For example, it has previously been reported that 1 hour of running
at 70% VO2max perturbs tight-junction regulatory proteins and sub-
sequently increases intestinal permeability.24
Acute local intestinal injury stimulates NF-jB gene expression
within epithelial cells,25,26 initiating a local inflammatory cascade by
signalling release of pro-inflammatory cytokines such as interleukin
(IL)-1b, tumour necrosis factor (TNF)-a and interferon (IFN)-c. This
cytokine
profile
also
promotes tight-junction
dysregulation and
enhances intestinal permeability.27 A consequence of such multi-
pronged
disruption
to
barrier
integrity
is
heightened
bacterial
translocation with, for example, multiple reports of elevated circula-
tory bacterial endotoxins (eg, lipopolysaccharide) observed after
endurance exercise.15,28-30 The translocation of gram-negative and/
or gram-positive bacteria with potential accompaniment of outer
membrane vesicles containing peptidoglycan and lipopolysaccharide
also stimulates NF-jB gene expression through the NOD receptors
within the epithelium, which further contributes towards the magni-
tude of local and potentially systemic inflammatory responses.25,26,31
There are two protective mechanisms to deal with elevated bac-
terial translocation and pro-inflammatory cytokine responses. First,
anti-endotoxin antibodies are critical for the destruction and clear-
ance of bacterial endotoxins, and their reduced concentrations after
exercise can be viewed as evidence of acute endotoxaemia.28,32-35
The second protective mechanism targets the systemic pro-inflam-
matory cytokine response (ie, elevated IL-1b, TNFa and IL-6 within

 systemic circulation and phagocytic immune cell activation by IL-8),
which activates a compensatory anti-inflammatory response with
pronounced increases in IL-10 and IL-1ra.17,26,29,30,36 Similar to loca-
lised inflammation at the intestinal epithelium, the systemic inflam-
mation observed in response to increased intestinal permeability and
translocation of bacterial endotoxins into circulation further con-
tributes to the epithelial tight-junction dysregulation and heightened
intestinal permeability.23,27 Hence, local and systemic inflammatory
responses feed into a vicious cycle for endotoxaemia.
Exercise is also associated with changes in gastrointestinal
motility, with potential to slow gastric emptying and delay orocae-
cal transit, likely through exercise stimulated increases in sympa-
thetic
drive.11,18
Indeed,
gastrointestinal
symptoms,
such
as
bloating, belching, urge to regurgitate and regurgitation, are com-
monly reported by individuals partaking in strenuous exercise, and
these appear to be exacerbated if foods and fluids are consumed
whilst exercising.7,14,19 There is also evidence that exercise impairs
intestinal nutrient absorptive transport mechanisms leading to mal-
absorption.10,37 Malabsorption of carbohydrates consumed during
exercise is commonly seen after endurance running.19,38 It is, how-
ever,
unclear
if
the
mechanisms
underlying
impaired
nutrient
absorption are due to intestinal ischaemic injury, down-regulated
intestinal transporter activity, or a combination of both. Increased
delivery of nutrients, due to exercise-associated malabsorption, to
the distal ileum and colon has the potential to induce gastroin-
testinal symptoms through luminal distension from osmotically dri-
ven increases in small intestinal water content and gas production
from bacterial fermentation.39,40 In addition, nutrient presence in
the ileum may promote gastrointestinal symptoms through sup-
pressing gastric and duodeno-jejunal motility by the so-called “ileal
brake” feedback mechanism, using either neural or enteroendocrine
mediators.41,42

cells- aid in preventing intestinal originating pathogenic microorganisms gaining entry into systemic circulation; bsplanchnic hypoperfusion, and

or indirect (eg, nutrient malabsorption) alterations to gastrointestinal motility9,42,120

 It is likely, therefore, that exercise-induced gastrointestinal syn-
drome is the result of complex multi-factorial interactions between
the gastrointestinal tract with the circulatory, immune, and enteric
nervous systems. It is thus clear that in assessing the impact of exer-
cise on gastrointestinal status, a global approach, which encompass
structural and functional markers, should be adopted.

IMPACT OF EXERCISE STRESS ON
MARKERS OF GASTROINTESTINAL
INTEGRITY AND FUNCTION: A SYSTEMATIC
REVIEW
A systematic literature search was undertaken by three researchers
(RC, RS and CK), in accordance with methods used by Porter et al.,43
to determine the impact of acute exercise (ie, intensity, duration, and
mode) on markers of exercise-induced gastrointestinal syndrome,
using five online scientific databases, which included PubMed,
EBSCO, Web of Science (all databases), SPORTSdiscus and Ovid
Medline (Table S1). Original field observational studies and/or labo-
ratory controlled trials, presenting quantified data on markers of gas-
trointestinal integrity or function in a healthy (ie, absence of illness
and disease) human population that required participants to perform
an acute exercise bout were considered for the review. Studies were
suitable for inclusion if they involved an acute or prolonged external
intervention (eg, dietary, thermoregulatory or pharmacological inter-
vention) and contained a control or placebo arm. To maintain a
degree of consistency within measurement and analytical methods,
only studies conducted in the previous 20 years were considered.
Data were not considered appropriate for further synthesis into a
meta-analysis due to the absence of homogeneous interventions and
outcomes. An additional review (RC, RS, CK and PG) was also under-
taken to determine gastrointestinal perturbation in populations with
gastrointestinal diseases/disorders under acute exercise conditions.
Due to the limited publications identified, a narrative description
was used to depict outcomes.

EXERCISE AND INTESTINAL INJURY
The main method for demonstrating intestinal epithelial injury has
been by measuring changes in circulating concentrations of intestinal
fatty-acid binding protein (I-FABP), a small (14-kD) cytosolic protein
that is rapidly released into circulation upon injury and damage to
mature enterocytes.9 I-FABP correlates with exercise-associated
splanchnic hypoperfusion and subsequent ischaemia,12,20 and there-
fore, may be a useful surrogate indicator of reductions in villous
microvascular blood flow. As shown in Table 1 (ie, eight studies were
eligible for inclusion- Table S1), several laboratory studies have
reported prolonged (≥1 hour) running and cycling, and resistance
exercise
of
short
duration
(30 minutes)
to
induce
significant
increases in I-FABP. The greatest exercise-associated increase in
plasma I-FABP concentrations have been reported in response to
vigorous
endurance
exercise
protocols
involving
running
and
cycling,20,46,47 with the greatest concentration being observed when
vigorous exercise was performed in hot ambient conditions (30°C).47
A recent study, however, reported mean plasma I-FABP concentra-
tions of >1000 pg/mL, on two separate occasions, after 3 hours of
prolonged strenuous exercise (ie, 2 hours of running at 60% VO2max,
followed by a 1 hour self-paced running distance test) in thermoneu-
tral conditions,19 suggesting exercise duration may be a key con-
tributing factor to the magnitude of exercise-associated intestinal
epithelial injury. In contrast to the majority of studies, Sessions
et al.44 found a modest insignificant increase in plasma I-FABP con-
centration (88 pg/mL) in seven volunteers after 60 minutes running
at 70% VO2max in hot ambient conditions (30°C). These discrepant
findings may be due to methodological differences such as sample
timing
(immediately
post-exercise
vs
further
into
recovery
[ie,
20 minutes post-exercise]) and participant characteristics (ie, fitness
status). Indeed, Morrison et al.47 found greater increases in post-
exercise I-FABP concentration, in participants with greater weekly
training loads, after 90 minutes of vigorous running and cycling exer-
cise in the heat.
Other less direct markers of intestinal epithelial injury might
include faecal calprotectin, a marker of mucosal inflammation sec-
ondary to such injury, or faecal blood loss. However, unlike I-FABP,
neither are specific to small intestine. Increased faecal calprotectin
concentration following exercise was reported in one study of 20
healthy male participants,20 but the change was small (median:
0.41 lg/g); one must be guarded in assigning physiological signifi-
cance to such a change. Faecal blood loss remains a preferable end-
point and has been qualitatively reported in 14% of male triathletes
in response to a 3 hours cycling-running protocol at 77% VO2max in
thermoneutral ambient conditions (22°C).49 These findings support
the commonly reported faecal blood loss after endurance events (ie,
marathon and ultra-marathon competition).16,50,51

EXERCISE AND INTESTINAL
PERMEABILITY
As previously discussed, exercise-associated increases in gastroin-
testinal permeability are suggested to arise from intestinal epithelial
injury and tight-junction dysfunction induced by splanchnic hypoper-
fusion, which may be exacerbated by local and systemic inflamma-
tory responses. Dual-sugar tests have been used to determine
exercise-associated changes in intestinal permeability; lactulose with
rhamnose or mannitol is used for small intestine, sucralose and ery-
thritol for large intestine, and sucrose for gastric permeability.12,52,53
As outlined in Table 2 (seven studies were eligible for inclusion
Table S1), gastrointestinal permeability appears to increase in pro-
portion to the magnitude of exercise, with higher body temperature
and running linked with greater permeability.52,56,57 For example,
marathon competition and running at ≥70% VO2max, with or without
heat stress, with body temperature ≥39°C, resulted in the highest
reported rates of elevated small intestinal permeability.52,54,56,57
COSTA ET AL.

249
 In addition, factors such as restriction of fluid during exercise and/or
dehydration may also contribute to the magnitude of change in
intestinal permeability.52,54-56 Pals et al.52 highlighted the dose-
response in small intestinal permeability with increasing exercise
intensity following 1 hour running in thermoneutral ambient condi-
tions at 40%, 60% and 80% VO2max, in which final rectal tempera-
ture (38.0°C, 38.7°C and 39.6°C, respectively) and exercise-induced
body mass loss (0.6%, 1.2% and 1.9%, respectively) also increased in
proportion to exercise intensity.
The paucity of studies reporting changes in exercise-associated
gastric and large intestinal permeability make it difficult to confi-
dently conclude outcomes relating to the effect of exercise on per-
meability to these segments of the gastrointestinal tract. Gastric and
large intestinal permeability was not affected by 1 hour cycling at
70% VO2max in a small group of male participants,20 but fluid restric-
tion during running resulting in modest dehydration, and high inten-
sity running (80% VO2max) were associated with increased gastric
permeability.52,55
Considering the variation in dual-sugar test outcomes observed
between studies, methodological factors such as the length of urine
collection, which varies from 1 hour to 24 hours, variations in dose
of sugar/s administered, timing of ingestion (ie, before vs during vs.
after exercise), and the format of data reporting (eg, ratio, %, or
area-under-the-curve) make direct comparisons between studies dif-
ficult. One investigating group examined circulating levels of claudin
and found it increased with strenuous running in two cohorts,54 but
the interpretation of this as representing changes in permeability
requires validation.

EXERCISE AND ENDOTOXAEMIA
Endotoxaemia is characterised by the presence of circulating bacte-
rial lipopolysaccharides, which attach to lipopolysaccharide-binding
protein to form immune complexes that initiate a cell-mediated
immune cascade.58,59 The reference cut-off value indicative of exer-
cise-associated endotoxaemia as reported in the literature is ≥5 pg/
mL increase in plasma or serum lipopolysaccharide from baseline,
with adjunct reduction in anti-endotoxin antibody concentration (eg,
IgG and IgM).15,28,34,60,61 Multiple studies have measured these end-
points in response to exercise (ie, seventeen studies were eligible for
inclusion- Table S1), predominantly using a limulus amebocyte lysate
chromogenic assay for determination of gram-negative bacterial
endotoxin concentration, and the results are shown in Table 3.
The
greatest
exercise-associated
endotoxaemia
have
been
reported in response to extreme endurance exercise, such as ultra-
marathon events.29,30 Moreover, one study that measured plasma
sCD14, a phosphatidylinositol-linked membrane glycoprotein on
polymorphonuclear leucocytes that serves as a receptor for endo-
toxin and hence increases in response to septic conditions, signifi-
cantly increased from pre- to post-exercise in ultra-endurance
runners after a 161 km ultra-marathon competition.69 These out-
comes are supported by earlier studies, reporting total plasma endo-
toxin concentrations of 213 pg/mL, 254 pg/mL and 64-330 pg/mL
in response to an Ironman distance triathlon, 89.4 km ultra-marathon
and 100 mile cycle events respectively.34,60,70 One paradoxical find-
ing was the absence of endotoxaemia after a 160 km ultra-mara-
thon,62 even in the presence of a systemic immune response,
indicated by elevated cytokines,62 and sCD1469 reported at the
same ultra-marathon event (ie, Western States 100 Mile Endurance
Run).
From the data available in the literature, moderate exercise dura-
tions (eg, <2 hours) produce negligible rises in circulating endotoxin
concentration.

 within shorter high intensity exercise bouts to exhaustion, appear to
result in circulating endotoxin concentrations above the reference
criterion. In studies reporting substantial elevations in post-exercise
endotoxin
concentration,
a
pronounced
cytokinaemia
is
also
observed, featuring both systemic pro-inflammatory and compen-
satory
anti-inflammatory
responses,
remaining
elevated
from
24 hours to 1 week after cessation of exercise.15,29,30,69 This is
accordance with the cytokine response seen in septicaemia (ie,
increase in IL-1b, TNF-a, IL-6, IL-8, IL-10 and IL-1ra). Moreover, mild
to severe gastrointestinal symptoms (ie, nausea, regurgitation and
faecal blood loss) have also been reported in studies observing endo-
toxaemia and cytokinaemia post-exercise. However, associations
between gastrointestinal symptoms and endotoxaemia have not
always been consistent.15,16,29,30,60,70
Considering the translocation of endotoxic microorganisms into
circulation is dependent on the presence of indigenous bacterial spe-
cies within the gastrointestinal tract, it is plausible that the total bac-
terial abundance and bacterial diversity (eg, Firmicutes, Bacteroides,
Proteobacteria, Actinobacteria and Enterobacteriaceae) of the intestinal
microbiome
may
influence
the
magnitude
of
endotoxaemia
in
response to exercise, and subsequent systemic immune responses
(Figure 2).71 For example, an intestinal microbiome diversity with
high abundance of short chain fatty-acid (eg, butyrate) producing
microorganisms (eg, Bifidobacterium, Lactobacillus and Clostridium lep-
tum), known to enhance epithelial barrier and tight-junction integrity,
stability and function, and in addition to enhancing restitution of
epithelial lesions,72-74 may be protective against exercise-associated
gastrointestinal
barrier
perturbations
and
systemic
responses.
Although, a microbiome profile abundant in bacterial species with
endotoxins (eg, Escherichia coli lipopolysaccharide) and associated
pathogenic structures (ie, outer membrane vesicles containing pepti-
doglycan)25,26,31
may
promote
exacerbated
endotoxaemia,
local
epithelial and systemic responses.75,76
From a practical perspective, there is accumulating evidence that
diets excessively high in protein, fat, and/or sugars, or low in fibre
and fermentable carbohydrates, or even micronutrient administration
(ie, oral iron replacement therapy) may have major effects on the
intestinal microbiome total abundance and diversity, some of which
are regarded as dysbiotic.77-79 Such diets are common among indi-
viduals partaking in sports and exercise programs, and thus certain
adherence to “extreme diets” may contribute to the endotoxaemia
observed after prolonged strenuous exercise. In addition, there is
also evidence that repetitive exercise training80 and sustaining an
active lifestyle81 creates changes in the intestinal microbiome diver-
sity in human populations (ie, higher Firmicutes to Bacteroides ratio
compared to healthy controls, and higher abundance of Bifidobac-
terium, Lactobacillus, and Clostridium leptum;80 and higher abundance
of Faecalibacterium prausnitzii, Roseburia hominis and Akkermansia
muciniphila).81 However, it is unclear the clinical relevance of these
changes, and how they contribute to the overall gastrointestinal
response to exercise. To date, no research has determined if the
total bacterial abundance, diversity, and functional interaction of the
intestinal microbiome influences the various components of exer-
cise-induced gastrointestinal syndrome, which warrants substantia-
tion. It is also unknown whether acute exercise stress and the
physiological alteration of the gastrointestinal tract in response to
acute exercise promotes abrupt changes to the intestinal microbiome
total bacterial abundance and diversity.

 concentration and euhydration, aimed at attenuating fatigue and
enhancing exercise performance.82,83 However, consumption during
a period when gastrointestinal motility is compromised may create a
symptomatic burden, owing to pronounced intra-gastric pressure
associated with reduced gastric empting rates, reduced orocaecal
transit time (OCTT), and/or potentially malabsorption increasing
intestinal luminal distention due to, for example, osmotic effects of
short-chain carbohydrates and/or their fermentation.11,18,19,39,40 The
majority of studies identified included a measure of gastric emptying,
and four studies also included a measure of OCTT (Table S1). The
result of those studies are shown in Table 4.
Exercise intensity appears to be a key regulator of gastric empty-
ing rate, with higher intensity exercise (≥70% peak power output)
causing the greatest disturbance to gastric motility. For example,
gastric empting of a pre-exercise carbohydrate electrolyte solution,
determined by direct aspiration, was reduced in response to inter-
mittent sprint cycling (alternating between 100% VO2max and 75%
VO2max), when compared to steady state exercise (66% VO2max) and
rest.87 Intermittent high intensity running has also been shown to
slow gastric emptying compared with walking.88 However, steady
state moderate exercise (60% to 70% peak power output or 66%
VO2max equivalent) does not appear to influence gastric emptying
and intestinal transit compared to rest in well-trained individu-
als.87,90,91 The impact of high intensity exercise on gastric motility
appears to be short-lived, as the intensity of prior exercise (rest,
33% peak power output, or 1091 minutes intervals at peak power
output) has negligible effect on post-exercise gastric emptying rate
of a glucose solution.84 A systematic review of exercise and gastric
emptying by Horner et al.18 supports these observations, reporting a
dose-response of slower emptying with exercise of higher intensities
and longer duration.
The impact of acute exercise on OCTT is unclear (Table 4).
When measured using a lactulose challenge breath test and subse-
quent appearance of H2 over time, OCTT decreases by 40% and
19% following vigorous cycling for 90 minutes at 70% and ~80%
VO2max, respectively;90,91 while a greater decrease was reported
with running at the same intensity (~74%).80 In contrast, when fluo-
roscopy was used, faster intestinal transit times were found post-
exercise in trained orienteers undertaking a week of heavy train-
ing,89 and a 30 minutes bout of acute exercise in trained males had
minimal influence on the transit time of food up to the ileocaecal
valve.85 Consistency in the measures of OCTT employed in future
studies should help to better elucidate the effect of diverse-exercise
(ie, intensity, duration and mode) on OCTT.
Gastric myoelectrical activity may be used to infer gastric motil-
ity, and two identified studies employed the technique of electrogas-
trography following exercise. Supine cycling for 20 minutes at 60 W
increased signal amplitude compared to that at rest,92 and low inten-
sity cycling (~25 minutes) in non-regular exercising individuals has
been shown to increase motility.93 Whether such effects were medi-
ated by changes in vagal pathways is not known; but, in rats, exer-
cise-induced gastric antral motility is abolished with vagotomy.94
Considering exercise promotes a potent sympathetic drive, it is
thought that sympathetic activation may delay gastric emptying in
response to stress,95 since reducing sympathetic activity in an animal
model of spinal cord injury was associated with an increase in gastric
emptying and intestinal transit.96
Exercise bouts of low to moderate intensity, of short duration
(ie, <60 minutes), appear to promote gastrointestinal motility, while
more prolonged (ie, up to 90 minutes) and vigorous exercise may
cause inhibition. Given the complex interaction of hormonal and
neurological control of gastric motility (reviewed by Browning and
Travagli),97 further studies are required to elucidate the role of acute
and prolonged exercise on gastric and intestinal motility. For exam-
ple, endurance and ultra-endurance athletes often report rapid and
aggressive onset of severe regurgitation, abdominal pain, and inabil-
ity to tolerate feeding when exercise duration reaches ≥3 hours. It is
reasonable to hypothesise that gastroparesis and paralytic ileus
might underlie these symptoms. To date, no study has investigated
gastric emptying and/or OCTT in extreme endurance events; there-
fore, the question of whether the duration of exercise promotes par-
alytic ileus needs to be addressed. Furthermore, the impact of heat
stress during exercise on gastrointestinal motility is still largely
unknown and warrants investigation.

EXERCISE AND MALABSORPTION
The competent functioning of nutrient transporters on intestinal
enterocytes during exercise is important for achieving nutrient
intake requirements during prolonged exercise and avoiding the
occurrence of gastrointestinal symptoms arising from nutrient malab-
sorption, as well as aiding post-exercise nutrient absorption that can
optimise recovery processes.14,19,37 Intestinal nutrient transporter
activity during exercise can be determined by urinary excretion of
non-metabolisable glucose analogues, such as D-xylose that is pas-
sively absorbed (ie, GLUT5 activity), and 3-O-methyl-D-glucose
(3MG) that is actively absorbed (ie, SGLT1 activity).10 Reduced
active and passive carbohydrate absorption has been observed in
response to running at 70% VO2max compared to rest, or after run-
ning at 30% and 50% VO2max in thermoneutral ambient condi-
tions.10
Body
temperature
and
dehydration
were
higher
with
increasing exercise intensity, but whether these factors affected the
absorption of the glucose analogues consumed at the start of exer-
cise is unknown. A reduction in post-exercise protein absorption, as
measured by in vivo combination of 20 g L-[1-13C]phenylalanine-
labelled protein ingestion with continuous intravenous L-[ring-2H5]
phenylalanine infusion,98 was observed after a single bout of resis-
tance-type exercise.37 Plasma I-FABP concentration increased 35%
after the resistance exercise, suggesting impairment in protein
absorption during the post-exercise recovery period was possibly
due to injury associated loss of intestinal absorptive function. It is
speculated that exercise-associated splanchnic hypoperfusion may
contribute to the reduced intestinal epithelial absorptive activity
seen in response to exercise, but further research is required to elu-
cidate the exact mechanisms.

 Carbohydrate malabsorption can be measured by breath hydro-
gen (H2) excretion after the consumption of glucose and/or fructose
that is normally absorbed. During 3 hours of alternating running and
cycling at 75% VO2max,38 breath H2 was higher during running than
cycling, and consumption of both fluid (1.3 g/kgBM/h) and semi-
solid (1.2 g/kgBM/h) glucose-rich carbohydrates resulted in higher
breath H2 excretion (increase in 2 and 3 ppm, respectively) com-
pared with a non-carbohydrate placebo. However, such increases are
minimal and of uncertain significance. Comparison of breath hydro-
gen before and during exercise must take into account that breath
H2 may be reduced during the increased ventilation rate associated
with exercise.99 Post-exercise values taken when respiratory rate
returns to resting levels may be a more accurate measure of nutrient
malabsorption. For example, of the 25 healthy endurance trained
runners challenged with 90 g/h of carbohydrate (2:1 glucose to fruc-
tose, 10% w/v) during a 3 hours running protocol, 68% showed evi-
dence of carbohydrate malabsorption (breath H2 ≥10 ppm above
baseline)100 during the recovery period.19 Moreover, breath H2
responses in this study correlated with incidence and severity of gas-
trointestinal symptoms, suggesting factors contributing to exercise-
associated malabsorption (eg, epithelial injury, nutrient transport
impairment and/or poor nutrient tolerance) may pre-dispose an indi-
vidual to gastrointestinal issues during exercise.

EXERCISE-ASSOCIATED
GASTROINTESTINAL SYMPTOMS
The incidence of gastrointestinal symptoms during exercise (ie, pre-
dominantly endurance exercise) has previously been reviewed by ter
Steege and Kolkman8. More recently, however, several field-based
observational studies that have comprehensively assessed gastroin-
testinal symptoms during extreme endurance events identified a high
incidence and severity of symptoms from both presumed upper- (eg,
regurgitation, upper abdominal bloating, belching, epigastric pain and
heartburn) and lower- (eg, flatulence, urge to defecate, lower abdom-
inal bloating, abdominal pain, abnormal defecation including loose
water stools, diarrhoea and faecal blood loss) gastrointestinal origin,
and nausea far above what has previously been reported. Such
symptoms have been major factors associated with withdrawal from
competition due to their severity and to more worrying clinical fea-
tures of acute colitis that included faecal blood loss (Table 5).7,14-
16,101,102 The types and prevalence of different gastrointestinal
symptoms reported during a multi-stage and 24 hours continuous
ultra-marathon can be viewed in Figure 3, and are consistent with
those reported in response to other endurance events (ie, marathon
distance, long course triathlon and 161 km ultra-marathon).7,14-16
These findings and those of other endurance events clearly highlight
that symptoms referable to the upper-gastrointestinal tract, including
nausea, are the predominant symptoms reported during exercise, in
comparison to those referable to the lower-gastrointestinal tract.
Several risk factors for developing symptoms during exercise have
been identified. First, the duration of exercise is not unexpectedly a
factor. For example, 96%, 85% and 73% of an ultra-endurance athlete
cohort competing in a 161 km, multi-stage, and 24 hours continuous
ultra-marathon, respectively, reported severe gastrointestinal symp-
toms during competition.14,16 In contrast, only 11% and 7% of endur-
ance runners who had completed a half-marathon and marathon,
respectively, reported gastrointestinal symptom.7 Second, the type of
exercise influences risk, with running repeatedly shown to promote
greater incidence and severity of gastrointestinal symptoms compared
to other exercise modes (eg, cycling).8,91,102 Third, ambient tempera-
ture is important with higher incidence and severity of gastrointestinal
symptoms in hot ambient conditions (ie, ≥30°C) compared to those
reported in cold to thermoneutral ambient conditions.14 Fourth,
women are more prone to exercise-associated gastrointestinal symp-
toms than men.7,19 Fifth, individuals with history of recurrent exer-
cise-associated gastrointestinal symptoms appear to suffer greater
incidence and severity of symptoms during exercise,7,19 suggesting
some degree of pre-disposition. Finally, feeding during exercise at a
time when the gastrointestinal tract is compromised may be a risk fac-
tor. Indeed, 100% and 52% of participants during a gut-challenge pro-
tocol suffered from mild and severe symptoms, respectively, when
challenged with 90 g/h CHO (2:1 glucose-fructose, 10% w/v) during
running at 60% VO2max in thermoneutral ambient conditions, in which
euhydration was maintained throughout.19

 compromised gastrointestinal integrity and function. This would
apply particularly to the patients with IBD or FGID such as, IBS and
functional dyspepsia. The adverse effects of strenuous exercise of
greatest concern are: (1) the repetitive injury to the intestinal epithe-
lium with insufficient recovery time in-between insults; (2) effects on
gut motility associated with intestinal hypoperfusion, ischaemia and
altered enteric nervous activity during exercise and (3) local and sys-
temic
inflammatory
responses
associated
with
intestinal
injury,
enhanced epithelial permeability, endotoxaemia and the oxidative
stress associated with reperfusion.9,27,36 Concern also generates
from studies in murine models of chemically induced colitis, in which
voluntary exercise reduces inflammation, but vigorous exercise pro-
grams have led to increased inflammation and mortality.104
Exercise has generally been advocated for populations suffering
from IBD and FGID for relapse prevention, management and
improving quality of life.105,106 There are associations between low

 levels of habitual exercise (eg, walking or equivalent) and the pre-
vention and management of IBD and FGID, and lower risk of
relapse in IBD with higher exercise adherence.104,106 Moderate
levels of exercise that have included thrice weekly running or walk-
ing
programs
over
10-12 weeks
were
well
tolerated
without
changes in disease activity and associated with improvement of
various indices of well-being.107-109 Likewise, an individually tailored
increase in physical activity has been shown to improve gastroin-
testinal symptom severity in a cohort with IBS, compared to a con-
trol group with IBS who received no intervention.110 The benefits
appear to be maintained over several years.111 The mechanisms for
the improvements are likely to be multifactorial. Improvements in
gas clearance and subsequent bloating and discomfort symptoms
have been observed during mild cycling exercise of 75 minutes
duration in patients with IBS.112 It is important to note that the
overall exercise stress (ie, modest intensity and duration) in such
interventions would not be anticipated to prompt exercise-induced
gastrointestinal syndrome to any significant degree in healthy indi-
viduals.
Only two studies have examined the effects of higher intensity
exercise in patients with Crohn’s disease. First, 1 hour running at
60% VO2max in six patients with ileal Crohn’s disease in remission
did not cause further disturbances to gastrointestinal permeability,
OCTT or symptoms compared with matched controls; but evidence
of neutrophil activation, increased oxidative stress, and zinc loss in
the urine were noted.113 Second, 30 minutes cycling at 50% peak
power output, followed by four 15 s sprints at 100% peak power
output, induced mild perturbations to inflammatory profile in 15
young patients with Crohn’s disease;114 although these were gener-
ally similar to those observed in 15 matched healthy controls. The
results of these studies confirm that systemic inflammatory activa-
tion will occur in patients with Crohn’s disease in association with
exercise of moderate intensity, but detrimental effects on the dis-
ease itself over the short term were not apparent. Moreover, it is
currently unknown if individuals with IBD present greater exercise-
associated
endotoxaemia
compared
with
healthy
counterparts.
Where intestinal barrier is already compromised, it is plausible that
prolonged strenuous exercise may lead to greater endotoxaemia in

 comparison to those individuals with an intact intestinal barrier.
Indeed, increases in epithelial injury associated local inflammatory
cytokines (eg, TNF-a, IL-1b and INF-c) have been linked to greater
tight-junction perturbation and enhanced permeability of pathogenic
bacterial
endotoxins,
leading
to
an
endotoxin-induced
cytoki-
naemia.27,115,116 The safety of prolonged strenuous exercise in
patients with active disease is not known. With symptoms such as
joint pains and fatigue being common in patients with active IBD,
there are significant barriers to participation in such activities.117
Considering no research has yet identified the impact of vigorous
exercise on gastrointestinal integrity, function and symptoms in indi-
viduals suffering from gastrointestinal diseases/disorders, it should
be considered a risk to undergo prolonged strenuous exercise until
its safety is demonstrated, especially in IBD patients.
The final issue is whether strenuous exercise can induce or pre-
cipitate IBD or FGID in previously healthy individuals. There are
anecdotal reports of IBD diagnosis in ultra-endurance athletes fol-
lowing repetitive participation in extreme endurance exercise,118,119
but no formal examination of this association has been reported.
The difficulty with proving such an association is that the patho-
physiological changes associated with exercised-induced gastroin-
testinal syndrome may potentially precipitate a flare of inflammation
in individuals with IBD who believed themselves to be healthy, but
had relatively asymptomatic IBD prior to the exercise stimulus. Since
FGID is a syndrome characterised by chronic symptoms, it would be
challenging causally associating strenuous exercise bouts with the
development of the condition. However, as outlined above, gastroin-
testinal symptoms developing during exercise invariably resolve.
Large cohort observational studies are needed to provide clues of a
potentially causal association between participation in prolonged
strenuous exercise and the onset of IBD and FGID.
Overall, there is limited research that explores greater magnitudes
of exercise stress (intensity and duration) on markers of gastrointesti-
nal status (injury, inflammation, permeability, endotoxaemia, motility
and malabsorption) in populations suffering with diseases/disorders of
the gastrointestinal tract. Therefore, it is currently unknown if individ-
uals with gastrointestinal diseases/disorders present greater incidence
and severity of exercise-induced gastrointestinal syndrome compared
with healthy counterparts in response to acute exercise. Given the
current evidence to date, it is unlikely that individually prescribed low
to moderate intensity (≤60% VO2max) exercise of short duration
(≤1 hour) in the absence of additional stressors such as hot ambient
conditions, elevated body temperature, and/or dehydration will exac-
erbate factors that contribute to the development of exercise-induced
gastrointestinal syndrome. However, the physiological changes elicited
by more intensified exercise stress theoretically may have major
impact on the underlying gastrointestinal diseases/disorders, and it
makes clinical sense to advise patients against such at-risk situations,
particularly for those with IBD. In these populations, prior to partici-
pating in vigorous sporting events or exercise programs, it would be
advised to undertake a individually tailored gastrointestinal assess-
ment (ie, comprehensive integrity, function and symptoms markers) in
response to exercise stress (ie, within tolerable and safe limits), to
determine the magnitude of exercise-associated gastrointestinal per-
turbations, and to ascertain which primary causal and/or exacerbating
factor/s may be contributing to the greatest extent. Such information
may guide potential preventive and management strategies, and/or
appropriate exercise prescription on a case-by-case basis; bearing in
mind that the impact of vigorous exercise on gastrointestinal health of
populations with gastrointestinal diseases/disorders requires further
research.

PREVENTION STRATEGIES
There are several strategies that have been evaluated for their effi-
cacy to prevent or reduce the severity of exercise-associated gas-
trointestinal perturbations. These include the following:
11.1
|
Maintenance of euhydration
There is evidence that dehydration may exacerbate exercise-asso-
ciated gastrointestinal disturbances. Acute body mass loss of 2.7%, via
sauna exposure, prior to cycling exercise (70% VO2max) has been
shown to impair gastric emptying and increase gastrointestinal symp-
toms, including nausea, compared with starting exercise in a euhy-
drated state.120
Hydration status, however, had
no
effect
on
orocaecal transit time, intestinal permeability or glucose intestinal
absorption in response to the exercise. Dehydration (2.7% acute body
mass loss) 12 hours prior to exercise (via low intensity treadmill walk-
ing in the heat), however, did not influence gastric emptying during
steady state exercise (65% VO2max).121 In these two investigations,
fluid was provided during exercise but it is reasonable to suggest that
fluid restriction would further exacerbate any dehydration related
exercise-associated gastrointestinal disturbances as withholding fluid
during running exercise (acute body mass loss of ~1.5%) increases gas-
troduodenal and intestinal permeability above resting levels.55 Main-
taining euhydration during ultra-marathon competition may be an
important factor in attenuating exercise-induced endotoxaemia and
cytokinaemia.29,30 Indeed, participants who had an exercise-induced
body mass loss of >2% and a plasma osmolality >300 mOsmol/kg
showed higher average circulating endotoxin concentrations com-
pared with those who maintained euhydration with ad libitum water
intake during 2 hours running at 60% VO2max in hot ambient condi-
tion (34°C).67 Attention must also be given to avoid over-hydration
during exercise, considering exercise-associated hyponatraemia has
been linked to gastrointestinal symptoms, particularly nausea and
regurgitation.122,123 It therefore appears that starting exercise euhy-
drated and maintaining euhydration throughout attenuates various
components of exercise-induced gastrointestinal syndrome.

Consumption of carbohydrate during
exercise
Frequent and consistent consumption of carbohydrate during exer-
cise is a protective strategy against exercise-induced gastrointestinal

 perturbations. Carbohydrate presence in chyme, increased intestinal
carbohydrate transport activity and carbohydrate post-absorption
stimulate nitric oxide induced vasodilation, the most potent stimula-
tor for increasing post-prandial microvascular blood flow in intestinal
villi.124 Carbohydrate intake during exercise maintains splanchnic
perfusion (attenuates exercise-induced hypoperfusion)125 and ame-
liorates intestinal permeability in response to exercise stress and
NSAID administration.126 Indeed, we have observed an abolition of
intestinal injury, reduced intestinal permeability, and improved endo-
toxin and cytokine profile with the consumption of 15 g of carbohy-
drate pre-exercise and every 20 minutes during running at 60%
VO2max in 35°C, compared with water alone.127 Such quantities of
carbohydrate (45 g/h) appear to be well tolerated127. However,
higher rates (up to 90 g/h) of multiple-transportable carbohydrate
intake during running appear to be less tolerable,19 despite their rec-
ommended intake.128 Interestingly, 15 g of whey protein hydrolysate
administered pre-exercise and every 20 minutes during running also
results in similar gastrointestinal integrity outcomes, however symp-
toms were much higher, suggesting difficulties in tolerating protein
during exercise.127 It would therefore be beneficial to identify indi-
vidual carbohydrate intake tolerance levels (ie, quantity and quality)
during exercise that requires an exogenous fuel supply (ie, ≥2 hours),
and consume carbohydrates evenly and more frequently throughout
exercise.
11.3

Dietary adaptation of the gastrointestinal
tract pre-exercise
To date, only one study has comprehensively investigated a strategic
gut-training protocol to prevent or attenuate exercise-associated
gastrointestinal disturbances and symptoms. 2 weeks of carbohy-
drate ingestion during daily running exercise (90 g/h of carbohydrate
in either a gel disk 2:1 glucose to fructose ratio, or a carbohydrate-
rich food) significantly reduced overall gut discomfort, total and
upper-gastrointestinal symptoms by more than 40%, with reductions
in lower-gastrointestinal symptoms and nausea also reported, in
response to a 3 hours gut-challenge protocol, with no changes in
placebo observed.19 In addition, the gut-training resulted in an aboli-
tion of malabsorption and increased blood glucose availability, thus
providing some evidence for upregulation of intestinal carbohydrate
transporters.
There has recently been an exponential growth in the number of
non-coeliac athletes adhering to a gluten-free diet. Over 41% of a
non-coeliac athletic population surveyed reported adhering to a glu-
ten-free diet in the belief that the diet reduced gastrointestinal
symptoms and enhanced exercise performance.129 However, such
perceived improvements in symptoms and performance reported is
not supported by a blinded controlled study in which no difference
in gastrointestinal symptoms, intestinal injury or systemic cytokine
responses to exercise was observed between the presence or
absence of gluten.46 It is possible FODMAP reduction that typically
accompanies a gluten-free diet may be an efficacious strategy to
manage exercise-induced gastrointestinal symptoms. A recent case
study reported that a short-term low FODMAP diet (ie, reducing the
FODMAP content from 81 to 7 g/d) abolished gastrointestinal
symptoms during running and rest periods in a symptomatic multi-
sport athlete.130 There is substantial evidence to support the role of
a low FODMAP diet in the management of gastrointestinal symp-
toms, similar to those experienced by runners, in individuals suffering
from irritable bowel syndrome,131 and a low FODMAP diet may be a
promising strategy to reduce exercise-associated gastrointestinal dis-
turbances.
11.4
|
Avoidance of NSAIDs
It is well established that NSAIDs are gastrointestinal irritants, impact-
ing stomach gastric secretions, bicarbonate release in the duodenum,
and erosion of the mucosal lining along the gastrointestinal tract.
NSAID use has been linked to gastrointestinal injury and dysfunction,
including nausea, regurgitation, dyspepsia, gastrointestinal ulcers, gas-
trointestinal bleeding, and abnormal defecation (eg, diarrhoea).122,132
The administration of NSAIDs prior to exercise can markedly increase
intestinal injury and permeability in response to exercise,45,133,134 so
avoidance of NSAIDs prior to exercise would be recommended to
minimise exercise-associated gastrointestinal damage.
11.5
|
Dietary supplementation
It has been proposed that certain dietary supplements (ie, anti-oxi-
dants, glutamine, L-arginine, L-citrulline, bovine colostrum and probi-
otics) may contribute to the prevention and/or attenuate the
different perturbed components of exercise-induced gastrointestinal
syndrome. The rationale for such approaches includes the following.
Because exercise-induced disturbances to intestinal integrity and
endotoxaemia, especially in the reperfusion period after exercise,
which may be mediated by free radicals, anti-oxidant supplementa-
tion may prevent further epithelial damage and ameliorate endotox-
aemia.57,66 L-citrulline and L-arginine are precursors for nitric oxide
production, which is a potent vasodilator, potentially enhancing
blood flow into the intestinal microvasculature reducing exercise-
induced hypoperfusion and ischaemic.135,136 Glutamine and bovine
colostrum have been proposed to enhance the expression of heat
shock proteins (ie, proteins that protect cellular membrane under
period of stress), which may protect the intestinal enterocytes,
reduce intestinal permeability, and attenuate the development of
local inflammatory pathways.47,56,63,137-140 However, due to hetero-
geneity methods across studies (ie, magnitude of exercise- and heat-
stress, population, supplementation period and dose) and discrep-
ancy in outcomes, the evidence for the use of singular dietary sup-
plements in the prevention and management of exercise-induced
gastrointestinal syndrome in human populations is not clear, and
warrants further investigation.
The concept that probiotics might exert favourable effects on
intestinal epithelial integrity has led to three cross-over and blinded
controlled laboratory studies investigating the impact on probiotic
supplementation on markers of gastrointestinal integrity in response

 to exercise stress. 4 weeks of capsule form Lactobacillus, Bifidobac-
terium and Streptococcus (4.59109 colony forming units (CFU)) sup-
plementation
did
not
alter
exercise-induced
perturbations
to
gastrointestinal integrity, endotoxaemia and cytokinaemia, compared
with placebo, in response to running exercise to fatigue (approxi-
mately 35 minutes) at 80% of ventilatory threshold in the heat
(35°C).65 Similarly, 14 weeks of multi-species probiotics (1010 CFU/d)
had no effect on exercise-induced cytokinaemia in response to
90 minutes of cycle ergometer exercise using an incremental high
intensity protocol.141 A more recent study observed that oral inges-
tion of a commercially available probiotic beverage containing L.casei
(volume equivalent for 91011 CFU/d) for seven consecutive days
before 2 hours of running at 60% VO2max in hot ambient conditions
(34.0°C) resulted in a substantially greater endotoxaemia and cytoki-
naemia during the recovery period, compared with placebo.67 Thus,
evidence that probiotic might be beneficial in preventing or attenuat-
ing exercise-induced gastrointestinal syndrome is limited, and may
actually contribute as an exacerbating factor.
For future prevention and management strategy research, it
would be essential for experimental designs to consider and deter-
mine all relevant integrity and functional markers, comprising a com-
prehensive symptom assessment, and include a significant amount of
exercise stress (eg, ≥2 hours at ≥60% VO2max or equivalent), with
potential consideration of including heat stress, such as an ambient
temperature ≥30°C and/or hypohydration (eg, ≥3% acute body mass
loss and plasma osmolality ≥300 mOsmol/kg), which are common
external factors associated with exercise participation known to
exacerbate gastrointestinal issues. It is also important to note that
previous research in prevention and management strategies has
focused on healthy trained population. To date, no research on exer-
cise-induced gastrointestinal syndrome prevention and management
strategies has been conducted in populations with gastrointestinal
diseases/disorders, which clearly warrants investigation.

CONCLUSIONS
Exercise-induced gastrointestinal syndrome has the ability to create
acute disturbances in the health of the gastrointestinal tract due to
multiple physiological changes associated with hypoperfusion and
ischaemia, epithelial injury, impaired barrier function, impaired nutri-
ent absorption, altered gastric and intestinal motility, endotoxaemia,
local and systemic inflammation. These exercise-associated changes
to gastrointestinal integrity and function amplify in accordance with
the intensity and duration of exercise, and can be exacerbated by
running in hot ambient conditions. Gastrointestinal symptoms are a
common outcome, which can be modest and transient in nature, or
more clinically severe and prolonged. Whether the syndrome is asso-
ciated with the development of chronic disease acutely or after
repeated insults remains unclear, but is of concern and requires more
research. Considering exercise-induced gastrointestinal syndrome is
multifactorial in origin, assessing gastrointestinal barrier integrity and
functional responses during and/or after exercise in those individuals
presenting symptoms and/or health implications is key to establish-
ing the potential underlying mechanism(s) and biomarkers to recog-
nise them on an individual basis, subsequently informing and
tailoring preventive and management strategies.
