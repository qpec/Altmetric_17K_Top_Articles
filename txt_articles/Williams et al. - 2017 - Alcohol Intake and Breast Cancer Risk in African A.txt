Abstract
Background: Alcohol is a recognized risk factor for invasive
breast cancer, but few studies involve African American women.
Methods: The current analysis included 22,338 women
(5,108 cases of invasive breast cancer) from the African Amer-
ican Breast Cancer Epidemiology and Risk (AMBER) Consor-
tium. The association between number of alcoholic drinks per
week (dpw) and breast cancer was estimated using logistic
regression, adjusting for potential confounders, and stratifying
by breast cancer subtype.
Results: Approximately 35% of controls were current drinkers
at interview. Women who reported current drinking of �14 dpw
had an elevated risk of breast cancer compared with light drinkers
(>0–<4 dpw) [adjusted OR (ORadj), 1.33; 95% confidence inter-
val (CI), 1.07–1.64]. We observed elevated risk among women
drinking �7 dpw for ER� [ORadj, 1.31; 95% CI, 1.00–1.72], PR�
[ORadj, 1.28; 95% CI, 1.00–1.63], HER2� [ORadj, 1.36; 95% CI,
1.09–1.70], and triple-negative [ORadj, 1.39; 95% CI, 0.98–2.00]
molecular subtype. Among receptor-positive cases, ORs remained
elevated but attenuated relative to receptor-negative cases. Sen-
sitivity analysis of age-defined windows of exposure (<30 years,
30–49, 50þ years of age) did not reveal variation in patterns of
association. Risk associated with alcohol intake did not vary
significantly by oral contraceptive use, smoking status, or men-
opausal status.
Conclusions: Among African American women, similar to
women of European descent, drinking �7 alcoholic dpw was
associated with an increased risk of breast cancer regardless of
subtype.
Impact: Alcohol intake is a modifiable risk factor for breast
cancer, and reduced intake among African American women
should be encouraged. Cancer Epidemiol Biomarkers Prev; 26(5); 787–94.

Introduction
Although alcohol is an established risk factor for breast
cancer, most studies have been conducted in predominantly
white populations (1–9). African Americans report less alco-
hol intake than whites for a variety of reasons including
religious beliefs and prevalence of comorbid conditions, such
as type 2 diabetes or hypertension (10–18). Furthermore,
African American women have different patterns of exposure
to other breast cancer risk factors, including parity, oral
contraceptive use, age at menarche, breastfeeding, and age
at first birth (11, 13, 19–21). Many risk factors, including
alcohol exposure, contribute to breast cancer development
by altering duration of exposure or activity of hormones
(22, 23). Thus, it is important to understand the relationship
between alcohol and breast cancer risk in context of other
exposures.
Many breast cancer risk factors have distinct effects on risk of
ER-positive versus ER-negative breast cancers (21, 24, 25), and
several studies have shown distinct risk factor profiles for
triple-negative breast cancers (26–31). Despite suggestions
that alcohol exposure may modulate estrogen metabolism
pathways (32), there has been limited evidence that alcohol
exposure produces distinct effects on risk of ER-positive versus
ER-negative breast cancer. Moreover, very few studies have
evaluated alcohol-associated risk of triple-negative breast can-
cers (1, 14). Alcohol is hypothesized to be a "complete car-
cinogen" acting as both an initiator and promoter of the
disease through inhibition of DNA synthesis and repair
(33–36). The current study used data from the African Amer-
ican Breast Cancer Epidemiology and Risk (AMBER) consor-
tium to examine alcohol drinking among African American
women as a risk factor for invasive breast cancer overall, by
hormone receptor status, and triple-negative subtype. Both
recent and age-defined periods of alcohol exposure were eval-
uated in association with risk.

 Materials and Methods
Study population
This analysis included 22,338 African American women from
the AMBER consortium of four large epidemiologic studies of
breast cancer. The parent studies include the Carolina Breast
Cancer Study (CBCS; ref. 37), the Black Women's Health Study
(BWHS; ref. 38), the Multiethnic Cohort Study (MEC; ref. 39) and
the Women's Circle of Health Study (WCHS; ref. 40). The study
details for the AMBER consortium have been previously described
(41). Briefly, CBCS Phases I and II is a population-based case–
control study conducted in North Carolina from 1993 to 2001.
Breast cancer cases were identified through rapid case ascertain-
ment in cooperation with the NC Central Cancer Registry. Con-
trols were selected from North Carolina Department of Motor
Vehicles (women ages 20 to 64) and Health Care Administration
Financing lists (women ages 65 to 74). BWHS is a prospective
cohort study of 59,000 African American women from around the
United States enrolled by mailed questionnaire starting in 1995
with follow-up questionnaires administered every other year.
Cases were identified by self-report and confirmed by medical
record review or linkage with state cancer registries. MEC is a
prospective cohort study based in Hawaii and Los Angeles,
California, consisting of women from five different racial-ethnic
groups with over 16,000 African American women enrolled from
1993 to 1996. Cases were identified via linkage to the Los Angeles
County Cancer Surveillance Program, the State of California
Cancer Registry, and the Hawaii State Cancer Registry. WCHS is
a case–control study started in 2002 in New York City hospitals
and expanded into 10 counties in New Jersey, with cases identified
by rapid case ascertainment by the New Jersey State Cancer
Registry. Controls were identified by Random Digit Dialing in
both sites, complemented in NJ with community-based recruit-
ment (42). MEC and BWHS are prospective cohort studies sam-
pled as nested case–control studies with cases and controls
frequency matched by 5-year age categories, geographic location,
and most recent questionnaire completed (43). Research proto-
cols for each study were approved by the Institutional Review
Board at the respective institutions. All subjects provided
informed consent for study enrollment.
Eligible cases were women with a first diagnosis of invasive
breast cancer (N ¼ 5,108). Tumor subtype for estrogen receptor
(ER), progesterone receptor (PR), and HER2 classification was
based on pathology data from hospital records or cancer
registry records. Cases were classified as ERþ or PRþ if marker
expression was recorded as positive or borderline in the clinical
record. ER and PR status was missing for approximately 25% of
cases in the AMBER consortium (24). HER2 negative status was
defined as immunohistochemistry (IHC) reported as 0 or 1þ
staining intensity or a combination of negative by fluorescence in
situ hybridization and 2þ by IHC. HER2 testing was not routine
until the mid-2000's and is missing for approximately 50%
of AMBER cases (24). Triple-negative cases were classified as
negative for ER, PR, and HER2.
Exposure assessment
Each study ascertained alcohol intake via study question-
naire. For CBCS, type of alcohol (beer, wine, and liquor) and
amount (drinks per day, week, month) was queried for the
following age ranges for each participant: <25, 25 to 49, and
�50. WCHS collected alcoholic drinks/day for each decade of
life. For BWHS, type of alcohol (beer, wine, and liquor) and
amount (drinks per day, week, month) was asked at baseline
and amount was reported on the follow-up survey adminis-
tered every other year. For MEC, alcohol intake data was
gathered at baseline in 1993, and on the follow-up question-
naire in 2003. Participants reported the number of days per
week they drank alcohol and how many glasses/cans/bottles/
drinks of beer/wine/liquor they consumed. Level of recent
alcohol intake was determined by the self-reported drinking
in the age category that included diagnosis age (for cases) or
enrollment age (for non-cases) for all studies. Forty-four cases
(0.8%) and 256 controls (1.5%) were excluded from all anal-
yses due to missing information on alcohol drinking.
Statistical analyses
Participants were coded as never, past, or current drinkers based
on recent use. To be classified as a never drinker, participants had
to report being a never drinker for each of the surveys preceding
their index date. To be a past drinker, participants had to report
drinking during a time period before the period most proximal to
the index date and report no alcohol intake in the period most
proximal to diagnosis. Exposure categories (drinks/week) for
analyses stratified by subtype and modifiers were: never drinkers,
past drinkers, >0 to <4 (referent), �4 to <7, and �7. The highest
exposure category for stratified analyses was chosen because seven
or more drinks exceeds the Dietary Guidelines for Americans as
determined by Health and Human Services recommending no
more than 1 drink a day for women. Further, a relatively small
number of women in the study exceeded 7 drinks/week, so
stratified analyses resulted in too few women in the highest
category to produce reliable estimates. For the main analysis
(overall invasive breast cancer risk), the highest category was
divided into two: �7 to <14 and �14 drinks/week. The referent
category, light drinking (>0 to <4 drinks/week), was selected using
flexible modeling techniques with drinks/week modeled as a
squared-term and graphed against the log odds of breast cancer
with the corresponding 95% confidence intervals (95% CI) (Sup-
plementary Fig. S1).
To examine critical exposure windows for alcohol intake, we
created 3 age categories to describe intake during the following
time periods: young adult (age <25 for CBCS, <30 for WCHS),
middle adult (age 25–49 for CBCS, and 30–49 WCHS), and older
adult (age 50 and older). Because WCHS asked about intake for
each decade, the number of drinks/week for <20 and 20–29 was
averaged to obtain the number of drinks/week for <30 years of
age. This same rule was applied for 30–49 years of age (averaging
the thirties and forties), and 50 years of age or greater (averaging
the fifties and subsequent decades before diagnosis). The follow-
ing alcohol intake categories (drinks/week) were used: 0, >0 to <4
(referent), �4 to <7, and �7.
Logistic regression was used to calculate the odds ratio (OR)
and 95% CI for alcohol drinking and breast cancer risk. Two-
sided P values and a significance level of 0.05 were used for all
tests of statistical significance. To evaluate modification by
study, duration of oral contraceptive use, smoking status, and
menopausal status, likelihood ratio tests were conducted com-
paring the model with the interaction term to a reduced model.
Covariates selected as confounders in the multivariable (MV)
logistic regression models were selected on the basis of subject
matter knowledge and were used in the construction of a
directed acyclic graph (44). Covariates were coded as follows:
study time period (1993–1998, 1999–2005, 2006–2013),

 United States geographic location of the participant (Northeast,
South, Midwest, and West), parent study, age at diagnosis for
cases or age at index date for controls (less than 40, 40–49, 50–
59, 60–69, 70 or older), level of education (<12 years, 12 years,
13–15 years, 16 years, >16 years), age at menarche (<11 years,
11–12, 13–14, 15–16, 17 or older), parity (nulliparous, 1, 2, 3,
or 4 or more live births), postmenopausal hormone therapy
(HT) use defined as duration of combined estrogen and pro-
gesterone use (never used, ever used), recent body mass index
(BMI). Smoking status (never, former, current smoker), dura-
tion of oral contraceptive use (never, 1–9 years, 10 or more
years) and menopausal status (pre-, post-) were considered as
possible effect modifiers, but ultimately added as adjustment
variables in unstratified MV models. A complete case analysis
was used for the basic and MV logistic models (resulting in
exclusion of approximately 15% percent of cases and controls
in the MV model, largely due to missing menopausal status).
Analyses among excluded participants produced similar esti-
mates to those from MV models presented. Tests for trend for
drinks/week were conducted using >0 to <4 (referent), �4 to
<7, �7–<14 and �14 where noted, and excluded never/past
drinkers. Alcohol categories were treated as an ordinal variable
with the beta coefficient p-value serving as the measure of
significance for the test of linear trend. All analyses were done
in SAS version 9.3 (SAS Institute).
Results
The current analysis includes 5,108 cases of invasive breast
cancer and 17, 230 controls. Forty-five percent of participants
were never drinkers and 20.8% were past drinkers. Recent drink-
ing patterns differed by study (Table 1). Approximately 11% of
cases and controls reported drinking �4 drinks/week. CBCS,
BWHS and MEC had higher proportions of current drinkers
(CBCS: 40.6% of cases, 42.1% of controls; BWHS: 35.4% of cases,
37.8% of controls; MEC: 35.1% of cases, 34.5% of controls) than
WCHS (16.9% of cases, 17.5% of controls). Additional partici-
pant characteristics overall and by study can be found in Supple-
mentary Table S1.
Case–control ORs and 95% CI for the overall association
between
alcohol
intake
and
breast
cancer
are
presented
in Table 2. ORs for a minimally adjusted basic model and a
multivariable (MV) model (adjusted ORs) are reported in the
tables. We observed a J-shaped curve between recent alcohol
intake categories (excluding past drinking) and risk of invasive
breast cancer. Compared to light drinkers, overall, never drinking
was associated with elevated risk of breast cancer [adjusted OR,
1.12; 95% CI, 1.02–1.24; Table 2]. Drinking �14 drinks/week was
associated with significantly increased risk of invasive breast
cancer [adjusted OR, 1.33; 95% CI, 1.07–1.64; Table 2]. When
analyses were stratified by hormone receptor (HR) status, elevated
risk was observed in the highest intake category for all
subtypes. Table 2 shows slightly stronger risk associated with
�7 drinks/week among ER-negative [adjusted OR, 1.31; 95% CI,
1.00–1.72], PR-negative [adjusted OR, 1.28; 95% CI, 1.00–1.63],
HER2-negative [adjusted OR, 1.36; 95% CI,1.09–1.70], and triple-
negative cases [adjusted OR, 1.39; 95% CI, 0.98–2.00]. Associa-
tions were in the same direction for ERþ, PRþ, and HER2þ breast
cancers, but were slightly attenuated and non-significant.
Among the four studies, CBCS had the strongest J-shaped
pattern of risk: compared to drinking >0–<4 drinks/week, the
adjusted ORs were [1.23; 95% CI; 0.92–1.65; 1.50; 95% CI,
1.11–2.03; and 2.03; 95% CI, 1.29–3.18], respectively, for
never drinking, past drinking, and drinking �7 drinks/week
(Table 3). There were no associations between risk of breast
cancer and any alcohol intake in WCHS. In BWHS and MEC,
associations between alcohol intake and risk were similar in
direction to those in CBCS, but lower in magnitude (Table 3).
BWHS never drinkers had a significantly elevated risk of breast
cancer [adjusted OR, 1.17; 95% CI, 1.02–1.34]. The multivar-
iable P value for heterogeneity was 0.10.
We evaluated effect modification by smoking status, duration
of oral contraceptive use, and menopausal status (Supplementary
Tables S2–S4, respectively). We did not observe evidence for

 statistical interaction between alcohol intake and smoking status
in the multivariable model (MV P ¼ 0.58, Supplementary Table
S2). Risk was elevated in the highest alcohol intake category across
all strata of smoking status. Similarly, we did not observe evidence
of statistical interaction for alcohol intake and duration of oral
contraceptive use (MV P ¼ 0.17, Supplementary Table S3) or
menopausal status (MV P ¼ 0.38, Supplementary Table S4).
We evaluated drinking during specific age-defined periods.
Associations between recent drinking and risk were attenuated
when alcohol drinking was assessed by age-at-exposure, but only
two of the four AMBER studies (CBCS and WCHS) had data
available for drinking at different time periods so sample size is
limited. ORs for early, middle, and later life were close to the null
and did not show the dose–response trend observed for recent
drinking (Table 4).
Discussion
In this study among African American women in the AMBER
consortium, we found evidence of a J-shaped curve for alcohol
drinking and invasive breast cancer risk. Women who reported
drinking 14 or more drinks/week as compared to those drinking
>0–<4 drinks/week experienced the highest risk of invasive breast
cancer. Never drinkers also experienced a significantly elevated
risk of breast cancer. The J-shaped curve was not substantially
altered when stratifying by hormone receptor status or triple
negative subtype. In subtype-stratified analyses, alcohol intake
of 7 or more drinks/week was associated with increased risk of
breast cancer across all subtypes studied. There was no evidence
for statistical interaction by smoking, oral contraceptive use, or
menopausal status. Interestingly, past drinkers were most often
found to have a lower risk of breast cancer than women reporting
recent use, suggesting that decreasing alcohol consumption may
reduce risk. We conclude that alcohol is a risk factor for invasive
breast cancer among African American women, as has been
consistently shown among studies primarily involving white
women.
Previous studies of alcohol and cancer have found J-shaped
curves similar to those observed in this study (6, 45), but few
breast cancer studies have assessed or reported this dose-response
pattern (3–8, 11, 46–48). We hypothesize that J-shaped curve
morphology may be attributable in part to women with unmea-
sured comorbidities that preclude alcohol drinking, yet contrib-
ute to increased risk of breast cancer among never drinkers, such as
type 2 diabetes (6, 49). A behavioral study found that as self-
reported health status moves from poor to excellent among
African American women, there is a 10% increase in the odds of
alcohol drinking (16). In our study, women who were never
drinkers were more frequently of obese BMI, had lower education
(with the exception of BWHS), and were more likely report never

 having a mammogram. Future studies that explicitly capture
comorbidities and reasons for abstaining from alcohol would
help to elucidate the reasons for our observed elevated risk in
never drinkers.
Our findings of elevated risk among women drinking 14 or
more drinks/week are consistent with two large meta-analyses and
other epidemiologic studies conducted among primarily white
women (3–8, 11, 46, 47). Our findings are also consistent with the
literature showing an increased risk of both HRþ and HR� sub-
types with increasing alcohol intake (3, 8, 47, 50–54). Consid-
ering other co-exposures, similar to our findings, smoking did not
modify alcohol-associated risk in a meta-analysis of 53 epidemi-
ologic studies and a separate pooled analysis where elevated risk
was seen in the highest intake category of alcohol intake regardless
of smoking status (5, 53). The patterns of risk for duration of oral
contraceptive use mirrored those of our overall risk estimates,
with a J-shaped curve and no evidence of statistical interaction,
consistent with previous findings (2, 14).
The most important difference between our findings and pre-
vious literature was with regard to menopausal status and age-
related patterns. We observed no differences in associations
by menopausal status; previous studies among white women
have suggested that postmenopausal women who consumed
alcohol were at an elevated risk of breast cancer compared to
premenopausal women (3, 8, 48, 51, 53). However, our meno-
pause findings are echoed in our analysis of risk by age-period.
Previous studies have suggested that drinking before 40 to 50
years of age has a greater impact on breast cancer risk relative to
drinking at older ages (8, 51) These previous studies have been
conducted predominantly in white women, and different patterns
of co-exposures such as reproductive behavior may underlie
inconsistencies.
Our study has some limitations. First, we did not have dietary
intake or complete physical activity information for all the studies
in the AMBER consortium and did not account for these covariates
in our analyses. In addition, we did not have information on
reasons for alcohol abstinence, which could shed light on the
elevated risk observed among never drinkers in our study. Our
pooled analysis approach may be affected by differences between
studies. Differences in categorical data collection between studies
prevented evaluation of intake as a continuous variable, by grams
of alcohol or by alcohol type, but previous studies suggest that
cancer risk is most strongly associated with the type of alcoholic
beverage most frequently consumed in a population (3, 6).
Furthermore, although we did not find statistical evidence of
heterogeneity by study, we did observe some study-specific qual-
itative differences in the alcohol-risk association. Finally, case–
control studies in the consortium may have been subject to recall
bias, but work from the Nurses' Health Study did not find
significant differences in recall of alcohol intake comparing pre-
and post-diagnosis questionnaires among women with breast
cancer (55).
To conclude, in a large consortium of African American
women from around the United States, risk of breast cancer

as a risk factor for breast cancer in African American women,
where risk associations have been less well-studied. Future
work should seek to understand why African American women
who abstain from alcohol have an increased risk of breast
cancer. Finally, our results suggest that drinking cessation may
be associated with a reduced risk of invasive breast cancer and
may be a targetable public health intervention strategy among
African American women.
