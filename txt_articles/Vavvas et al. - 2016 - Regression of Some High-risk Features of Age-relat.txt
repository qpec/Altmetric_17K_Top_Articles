Importance: Age-related macular degeneration (AMD) remains the leading cause of blindness in developed
countries, and affects more than 150 million worldwide. Despite effective anti-angiogenic therapies for the less
prevalent neovascular form of AMD, treatments are lacking for the more prevalent dry form. Similarities in risk
factors and pathogenesis between AMD and atherosclerosis have led investigators to study the effects of statins
on AMD incidence and progression with mixed results. A limitation of these studies has been the heterogeneity of
AMD disease and the lack of standardization in statin dosage.
Objective: We were interested in studying the effects of high-dose statins, similar to those showing regression of
atherosclerotic plaques, in AMD.
Design: Pilot multicenter open-label prospective clinical study of 26 patients with diagnosis of AMD and the
presence of many large, soft drusenoid deposits. Patients received 80 mg of atorvastatin daily and were
monitored at baseline and every 3 months with complete ophthalmologic exam, best corrected visual acuity
(VA), fundus photographs, optical coherence tomography (OCT), and blood work (AST, ALT, CPK, total cholesterol,
TSH, creatinine, as well as a pregnancy test for premenopausal women).
Results: Twenty-three subjects completed a minimum follow-up of 12 months. High-dose atorvastatin resulted in
regression of drusen deposits associated with vision gain (+3.3 letters, p = 0.06) in 10 patients. No subjects
progressed to advanced neovascular AMD.
Conclusions: High-dose statins may result in resolution of drusenoid pigment epithelial detachments (PEDs) and
improvement in VA, without atrophy or neovascularization in a high-risk subgroup of AMD patients. Confirmation
from larger studies is warranted.

1. Introduction
Age-related macular degeneration (AMD) is the leading cause of
irreversible vision loss in the developed world (Miller, 2013; Wong
et al., 2014). The non-neovascular or “dry” form accounts for 85% of all
AMD and is characterized by accumulation of extracellular deposits,
termed drusen (Sarks et al., 1994), between the basal lamina of retinal
pigmented epithelium (RPE) and inner collagenous layer of Bruch's
membrane (BM), which is the inner wall of the choroid. Progression
to advanced AMD involves atrophy of the RPE and overlying photore-
ceptors (geographic atrophy), and/or choroidal neovascularization
(neovascular or “wet” AMD). While there are effective anti-angiogenic
therapies for the less prevalent neovascular AMD, there are no effective
treatments for the more prevalent dry form (Miller, 2013).
Several clinical and epidemiological studies have established cardio-
vascular risk factors (including smoking, hypertension, and serum lipid
status) to be associated with AMD development and progression, and
both diseases share susceptibility genes (Miller, 2013; Yip et al., 2015;
Tomany et al., 2004; Sene and Apte, 2014; Sene et al., 2015). This
suggests that both diseases share similarities in their pathogenesis,
and that interventions that reduce cardiovascular disease risk factors
may be useful in AMD.
Bruch's membrane (BM) lies under the RPE and forms the inner
margin of the choriocapillaris, and thus is considered the structural
analog of the vascular intima (Curcio et al., 2001). Analogous aging
changes in the vascular intima and BM are thought to relate to the path-
ogenesis of atherosclerosis and AMD, respectively (Sivaprasad et al.,
2005). Similarities in the protein molecular composition of drusen and

 arteriosclerotic deposits corroborate this perception (Mullins et al.,
2000). In both conditions, apolipoprotein B (apo B) and cholesterol
accumulate, with subsequent modification, oxidation, and aggregation.
Drusen components are derived from local tissues (retina/RPE secreting
apo B,E-containing lipoproteins (Wang et al., 2009; Johnson et al.,
2011)) and from the circulation (Curcio et al., 2011; Wu et al., 2010),
and both AMD and atherosclerotic coronary artery disease involve lipo-
protein retention. In AMD, an inflammatory response to the accumulated
material may ensue with activation of complement and other compo-
nents of the immune system, which can lead to atrophy of RPE cells
and/or induction of a pro-angiogenic state and neovascular AMD.
Given these observations and similarities between atherosclerosis and
AMD, it has been hypothesized that statin treatment may affect AMD sta-
tus and/or progression (Hall et al., 2001). Statins suppress cholesterol
synthesis by inhibiting HMG-CoA reductase (the enzyme catalyzing the
rate limiting step in cholesterol biosynthesis). In addition, they increase
liver LDL receptors levels (Bilheimer et al., 1983), reduce apo B synthesis
(Arad et al., 1990) and suppress prenylation (the addition of hydrophobic
molecules to a protein that is a physiologic process that control localiza-
tion and function) (Kino et al., 2005). Multiple epidemiological studies
have examined this relationship with conflicting data (Gehlbach et al.,
2009). A 2015 Cochrane report (Gehlbach et al., 2015) concluded that
“[evidence is] insufficient to conclude if statins have a role in preventing
or delaying the onset or progression of AMD.” A small, proof-of-concept,
randomized, placebo-controlled study of the effect of simvastatin on the
course of AMD was recently published, and suggested that simvastatin
at 40 mg (equivalent to 20 mg atorvastatin) daily may slow progression
of early/intermediate AMD, especially for those with the at-risk comple-
ment factor H (CFH) genotype CC (Y402H) (Guymer et al., 2013). Another
recent study in patients with elevated plasma lipid levels found that statin
use for more than a year was associated with an increased hazard for
neovascular AMD (VanderBeek et al., 2013), and the authors postulated
that these patients were resistant to statin treatment, rather than statins
leading to increased risk for neovascular AMD. The Alienor study
suggested that elderly patients with high HDL concentration may be at
increased risk for AMD; furthermore, it found that HDL dysfunction
might be implicated in AMD pathogenesis (Cougnard-Gregoire
et al., 2014). In contrast, data from a recent meta-analysis of three
population-based cohorts over a 20-year follow-up period did not show
a significant association between lipid levels or lipid pathway genes
with the incidence or progression of AMD (Klein et al., 2014a).
A major limitation in almost all studies thus far is the large heteroge-
neity of AMD disease (more than 100 at-risk genes and several pheno-
types) (Miller, 2013; Fritsche et al., 2015) and lack of standardization in
statin dosage (Gehlbach et al., 2009, 2015) or lipophilicity (Wu et al.,
2010; Chitose et al., 2014; Fong, 2014). There is clear evidence from the
cardiovascular literature that statin dose does matter (Cannon et al.,
2004; Pitt et al., 1999). The PROVE-IT study (Khush and Waters, 2004)
suggested that statin dose may be more important than LDL-c levels,
whereas the REVERSAL and ASTEROID trials showed benefit of aggres-
sive over moderate intensity/dosage therapy (Nissen, 2005; Nissen
et al., 2006, 2004). The ASTEROID trial even showed regression of coro-
nary atherosclerosis with very high-intensity statin therapy (Nissen
et al., 2006). Similarly, Yu et al. showed that intensive but not regular-
dose atorvastatin therapy resulted in regression of carotid atherosclerotic
disease (Yu et al., 2007) and two magnetic resonance (MR) imaging
studies have shown regression of the lipid core of atheromatous plaque
after high-dose statin (Kramer et al., 2011; Zhao et al., 2011).
Here we present the first evidence that treatment with high dose ator-
vastatin may result in regression of drusen and improvement of visual
acuity (VA) in patients with AMD with high-risk features for progression.
2. Methods
A case report and pilot multicenter phase1–2 prospective interven-
tional study (Mass. Eye and Ear, Boston, United States, and University
of Crete, Heraklion, Greece) were conducted with institutional review
board (IRB) approval, and informed consent was obtained from all par-
ticipants. Since there is some evidence in the literature that hydrophilic
statins (such as pravastatin) may not be equivalent to hydrophobic
statins (Wu et al., 2010; Chitose et al., 2014; Fong, 2014) we use the
hydrophobic atorvastatin (80 mg, daily). Pilot study inclusions were as
follows: patients over 50 years of age with diagnosis of AMD and the
presence of many large (N300 μm in diameter and more than 100 μm
in height) soft drusenoid PEDs. Exclusion criteria were as follows:
presence (or history) of significant geographic atrophy or choroidal
neovascularization in either eye; other eye diseases that could reduce
VA (excluding mild cataract); history of eye surgery (other than cataract
extraction); statin therapy (within the previous 2 years) at a dose equiv-
alent to atorvastatin ≥40 mg; history of liver disease, rhabdomyolysis, or
allergy to statins; pregnancy or nursing; current use of medications
known to interact with statins (e.g., cyclosporine, systemic itraconazole,
clarithromycin, HIV protease inhibitors); and elevated transaminases or
creatine phosphokinase (CPK) at baseline. Pseudophakia was not a rea-
son for exclusion, unless accompanied by significant posterior capsular
opacity. Patients received 80 mg of atorvastatin daily. Baseline complete
ophthalmologic exam, best-corrected VA by Early Treatment Diabetic
Retinopathy Study (ETDRS) chart, fundus photographs, fundus autoflu-
orescence, optical coherence tomography (OCT) and blood work (AST,
ALT, CPK, total cholesterol, TSH, creatinine, as well as a pregnancy test
for premenopausal women) were obtained. If there was any suspicion
of occult neovascular AMD and FA and ICG were performed. Patients
were monitored every 3 months with an eye exam, OCT imaging and
AST, ALT, total cholesterol, and CPK monitoring. Best corrected VA acu-
ity (EDTRS) and fundus photography were obtained every 6 months
and at exit from the study. Duration of treatment was a minimum of
1 year. Physicians trained in internal medicine were involved in the
design of the pilot study and in monitoring the patients during the
study. Statistics were performed using GraphPad Statistical Software
analysis (La Jolla, CA 92037 USA). The primary endpoint was reduction
of drusenoid pigment epithelial detachment (PED) volume N50% based
on OCT imaging at exit from the study. Drusen volume was measured
by automated analysis of macular retinal pigment epithelium (RPE)
elevations with the Cirrus HD-OCT. Any automated measurement can
have artifacts in segmentation especially if the quality of OCT obtain
is not adequate. All scans were verified that the segmentation was
appropriate.
3. Results
3.1. Report of Initial Case
An otherwise healthy 63-year-old man with AMD on Age-Related
Eye Disease Study (AREDS) vitamin supplements presented for a second
opinion because of deteriorating VA. Baseline VA was 20/25 in each eye
with significant distortion. Fundoscopy revealed bilateral extensive
confluent large soft drusen and pigmentary alterations (Fig. 1, top
row). Spectral domain OCT (SD-OCT) confirmed significant drusenoid
PEDs as well as architectural distortion of the overlying RPE and photo-
receptor layers (Fig. 2, top row). No subretinal or intraretinal fluid was
present. Standard AREDS vitamin supplementation was continued.
One year later, the patient became more symptomatic, and VA was
slightly decreased to 20/30 in each eye. After extensive discussion, the
patient was started on atorvastatin, beginning with 10 mg daily and
increasing gradually over 9 months by a predetermined rate (two-
month intervals of 10 mg/day, 20 mg/day, 40 mg/day, 60 mg/day, and
80 mg/day) to the target 80 mg daily dose. Six months after reaching
a daily dose of 80 mg atorvastatin, VA improved by 12 letters to 20/20,
and examination with fundus examination and SD-OCT revealing com-
plete disappearance of the drusen without accompanying atrophy of the
RPE. Intraretinal hyper-reflective foci remained (Figs. 1 and 2, bottom
row).

 3.2. Pilot Study
Given these dramatic results, we initiated a pilot open-label multi-
center interventional prospective trial at two academic medical centers,
one in the United States and one in Europe, to determine if these effects
might be generalizable. Of 26 patients enrolled in the two centers,
23 completed the pilot study (10 from Europe, 13 from the United
States). All patients were Caucasians, and seven were men. Three
patients exited the study: one because of cramps, one because of muscle
aches, and one because the patient felt the drug was inducing hair loss.
No patient exhibited elevated liver function tests (LFTs) that required
exit from the study.
Ten of 23 patients (Τable 1) responded to the treatment with signif-
icant regression of drusen deposits, with eight patients showing near
complete regression (similar to Fig. 2). Responders (4 from United
States, 6 from Europe, p = 0.1221) had a reduction in volume from
0.57 ± 0.47 mm3 to 0.049 ± 0.051 mm3 (p = 0.012). Non-responders
volume changed from 0.23 ± 0.20 mm3 to 0.35 ± 0.32 mm3. On
average, responders gained 3 letters whereas the non-responders lost
2.3 letters. The average time to response (resolution of the drusenoid
deposits without atrophy) was 11.7 months (range 3–22). Six patients
responded by 12 months and nine by month 18. The average person-
years of follow-up were ~30. None of the patients converted to
neovascular AMD. According to the online risk calculator (http://
caseyamdcalc.ohsu.edu ), it would be expected that 14% of our cases
(3–4/23 patients) would convert to neovascular AMD. Our alpha error
in detecting zero cases is 2.1%.
Responders were slightly older than non-responders (70.6 ± 6.2 vs.
66.2 ± 5.5, p = 0.081) and had equal baseline cholesterol levels (210 ±
33.4 vs. 207 ± 37.4 p = 0.86). Reduction of cholesterol levels did not
appear to correlate with response status (49 ± 31.2 in responders vs.
71 ± 35.9 in non-responders, p = 0.14). Women had a higher odds
ratio (7.71) of being responders, but this was not statistically significant
(95% confidence limits 0.746–79.7746, p = 0.0886). There were no
apparent differences in multivitamin use, aspirin use, fish oil consump-
tion, or anti-hypertensive medications. There was only one smoker in

 our study. Atorvastatin did not appear to have a positive or negative
effect on progression of pigmentary changes in fundus photographs or
on intraretinal hyper-reflective foci.
4. Discussion
AMD is the leading cause of irreversible vision loss in adults in the
industrialized world (Wong et al., 2014). Hallmarks of this disease
include lipid-rich basal linear deposits and drusen between the RPE
basal lamina and the remainder of BM (Wang et al., 2009; Curcio et al.,
2011), which are known to contain complement (Crabb, 2014) and
several immunogenic and toxic materials, such as 7-ketocholesterol
(Rodriguez et al., 2014) and amyloid (Luibl et al., 2006). In many studies,
drusen sampled for analysis are not confined to the macula; this is
important to note because peripheral drusen (which can differ from
macular drusen) may predominate (Crabb, 2014; Crabb et al., 2002).
Lipidation of BM is thought to impair transport of compounds necessary
for the health of the retina and RPE (Moore et al., 1995; Pauleikhoff et al.,
1990; Ethier et al., 2004; Cankova et al., 2011; Hussain et al., 2010). Elim-
ination of these deposits is widely regarded as of potential benefit to
patients. Although drusen can regress spontaneously, new lesions may
appear in other locations (Klein et al., 2004; Yehoshua et al., 2011) and
most often, development of late stages of disease (geographic atrophy
and or choroidal neovascularization) is often preceded by drusen reduc-
tion (Klein et al., 2004; Yehoshua et al., 2011; Brader et al., 2013). Several
trials have studied ways to reduce drusen, notably the Prophylactic
Treatment of Age-related Macular Degeneration (PTAMD) Study,
which used 810 nm laser to treat drusen (Friberg et al., 2006), and the
more recently complement C5 inhibitor trial (Garcia Filho et al., 2014).
Unfortunately, both studies failed to show regression or prevention
of progression to late AMD or improvement in visual acuity. Here we
present a case report and results of an open-label pilot prospective
study that provide the first evidence that medical intervention with
high-dose atorvastatin may cause regression of large drusen without
progression to advanced AMD, and with possible improvement in VA.
AMD is a heterogeneous disease, with several different phenotypes,
including types and size of drusen (Miller, 2013). Prior epidemiological
studies examining the role of statins in AMD (Hall et al., 2001; Gehlbach
et al., 2009, 2015; Guymer et al., 2013; VanderBeek et al., 2013;
Cougnard-Gregoire et al., 2014; Klein et al., 2014a, 2007; Tan et al.,
2007) did not stratify or distinguish patients based on AMD subtype. It
is unlikely that statins would have across-the-board effectiveness in a
heterogeneous disease, and for this reason we focused on patients
with large soft drusen and drusenoid PEDs, which are known risk factors

 for progression to advanced disease. AMD is also multifactorial, with
N100 reported at-risk genes that can be grouped into pathways
(Miller, 2013) with a subset of AMD-related genes that can be aligned
on an atherosclerosis-like progression (Fritsche et al., 2015; Pikuleva
and Curcio, 2014; Chen et al., 2010; Cheng et al., 2015; Neale et al.,
2010; Reynolds et al., 2010; Fritsche et al., 2013). Although prior studies
showed negative overall association between AMD and statin use, they
did suggest a potential protective role in a subset of patients with soft
drusen or in patient with the at risk CFH genotype CC (Y402H) risk
gene (Guymer et al., 2013; Klein et al., 2007; Tan et al., 2007). These
findings, taken together with our study, suggest that statins may have
a particular role in certain (intermediate-high risk, large drusenoid
deposits), but not all, AMD patients.
Cardiovascular studies suggest that the effect of statins on regression
of atheromatous pathology may not be related to actual serum LDL or
HDL levels achieved, as shown by the PROVE-IT trial (Khush and
Waters, 2004) or by a more recent head-to-head comparison of atorva-
statin 80 mg vs. rosuvastatin 40mg (Nicholls et al., 2011). Likewise, we
did not observe any differences in cholesterol level reduction between
responders and non-responders in our pilot study, suggesting that
factors other than lipid lowering response may be important for the
observed phenomena. That does not mean that lipid lowering is not
needed; lipid lowering may be a permissive state for drusen regression
to happen via other mechanisms. Aging macrophages have reduced
levels of the cholesterol transporter ABCA1, impaired cholesterol efflux,
and a pro-angiogenic polarization (Sene et al., 2013). Increased choles-
terol intake recapitulates these “aging” changes in macrophages and
leads to advanced neovascular AMD pathology in mice (Sene et al.,
2013). Mechanistically, lipid lowering by statins may reverse this
“aging” of macrophages and thereby improve AMD pathology. In addi-
tion, mice fed a high-fat diet exhibit RPE and BM changes similar to
human aging and AMD, such as lipid droplets in the BM; administration
of simvastatin led to significant reversal of these changes (Barathi et al.,
2014). This suggests that lipid lowering may be a necessary factor in
reversing AMD pathology (Barathi et al., 2014).
Statins are thought to have antioxidant properties (Profumo et al.,
2014). The RPE, bathed by the high oxygen tension environment of
the choriocapillaris (Friedman et al., 1964; Linsenmeier and Braun,
1992), is susceptible to chronic oxidative stress, which may play a role
in AMD pathogenesis (Hollyfield, 2010; Klein et al., 2014b; Suzuki
et al., 2007, 2012; Winkler et al., 1999). Statins have been shown to
reduce oxidative stress-induced injury to the RPE and increase viability
(Kim et al., 2012; Qian et al., 2011). Statins modulate ApoB100 secretion
in cultured human RPE cells via modulation of RPE cholesterol levels
(Wu et al., 2010), although not all statins are equivalent, with lipophilic
ones (like atorvastatin) being more effective than hydrophilic ones
(such as pravastatin). This differential effect of statin class on RPE func-
tion is yet another potential confounding variable that can affect results
of epidemiological studies that do not distinguish between classes of
statins.
Despite the high-risk characteristics of our patient cohort, none of
them progressed to neovascular or wet AMD. As noted earlier, mice
fed high cholesterol diet had a switch to the proangiogenic type of
macrophages and increased wet AMD phenotype (Sene et al., 2013).
Statins have been shown to reduce inflammatory cytokine IL-6
(Ito et al., 2002), to downregulate VEGF expression in TNFα-induced
tortuosity of retinal vessels in mice (Robinson et al., 2011), and to
reduce laser-induced choroidal neovascularization in a mouse model
of neovascular AMD (Yamada et al., 2007), suggesting a beneficial role
of statins in preventing conversion to neovascular AMD.
In addition, statins may benefit patients with large lipid-rich sub-
RPE drusenoid deposits through multiple potential mechanisms: by
preventing their accumulation through reduction of local and systemic
production, increasing the ability of macrophages and/or RPE to clear
debris, and/or by reducing oxidative damage and by stabilizing the
vascular supply to the macula.
Our open-label pilot safety/efficacy study suggests that intensive
statin treatment may cause regression of high-risk features of AMD,
such as drusen, without progression to advanced AMD and without
the vision loss that often accompanies spontaneous disappearance of
drusen. These results are consistent with the “locally produced oil-
spill” hypothesis (Curcio et al., 2011) of AMD pathogenesis. Of course
there are several obvious limitations of our study. It is an open label,
non-randomized pilot study with a small and rather homogeneous
sample size that is followed on average for only 1.5 years. It is known
that rarely, spontaneous reduction or collapse of drusen without
atrophy may occur and it is conceivable that our narrow cohort selected
for such patients. In addition, we do not know how long the effects can
last and how long statins should be administered. Finally, the effects of
statins in cases with preexisting atrophy are not addressed in this pilot
study. For these reasons, future larger randomized prospective studies
are needed to assess the exact role of statins in AMD. These studies
should take into account genotype and phenotype subgroups of AMD,
as well as dosing, lipophilicity, and potency of the statin tested.
