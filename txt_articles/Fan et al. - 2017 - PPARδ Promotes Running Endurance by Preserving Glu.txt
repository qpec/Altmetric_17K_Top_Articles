In Brief
Carbohydrate depletion in endurance
sports leads to the ‘‘hitting the wall’’
phenomenon, which is mitigated through
sports training. Fan et al. show that
muscle PPARd actively suppresses
glucose catabolism. Glucose sparing by
PPARd delays the onset of hypoglycemia
and extends running time by �100 min in
agonist-treated mice.

SUMMARY
Management of energy stores is critical during
endurance exercise; a shift in substrate utilization
from glucose toward fat is a hallmark of trained mus-
cle. Here we show that this key metabolic adaptation
is both dependent on muscle PPARd and stimulated
by PPARd ligand. Furthermore, we find that muscle
PPARd expression positively correlates with endur-
ance performance in BXD mouse reference popula-
tions. In addition to stimulating fatty acid metabolism
in sedentary mice, PPARd activation potently sup-
presses glucose catabolism and does so without
affecting either muscle fiber type or mitochondrial
content. By preserving systemic glucose levels,
PPARd acts to delay the onset of hypoglycemia
and extends running time by �100 min in treated
mice. Collectively, these results identify a bifurcated
PPARd program that underlies glucose sparing and
highlight the potential of PPARd-targeted exercise
mimetics in the treatment of metabolic disease,
dystrophies, and, unavoidably, the enhancement of
athletic performance.
INTRODUCTION
In endurance sports such as marathon running and cycling, car-
bohydrate depletion, commonly known as ‘‘hitting the wall,’’ is a
significant determinant of performance. Exercise training en-
hances endurance, in part, by delaying the depletion of carbohy-
drate stores (mainly glycogen in liver and muscle). The adaptive
benefits of exercise training are commonly attributed to the
glycolytic-to-oxidative fiber-type transformation and increased
mitochondrial energetic capacity (Holloszy and Booth, 1976),
programs in which the AMPK-PGC1a signaling pathway is now
known to play a major role. At the same time, exercise also
enhances muscle fatty acid (FA) oxidation (Mole
´ et al., 1971),
theoretically providing extra energy substrates for extended
performance and reducing the dependence on glucose. This
readily observed glucose sparing leads to the assumption that
increased FA oxidation extends performance. However, the
contribution of altered fat and glucose metabolism to endurance
and the molecular mechanism underlying this metabolic shift are
simply not known.
To address the above questions, we focused on the peroxi-
some proliferator-activated receptor delta (PPARd), a nuclear re-
ceptor that serves as a key regulator of FA metabolism in muscle
(Fan and Evans, 2015; Luquet et al., 2003; Wang et al., 2004).
Muscle-specific overexpression of PPARd not only induces an
oxidative fiber-type transformation but also increases FA
oxidation in skeletal muscle through the induction of two
mitochondrial gatekeeper proteins, carnitine palmitoyl-trans-
ferase 1b (Cpt1b), the rate-limiting enzyme in the transport of
FAs into the mitochondria (Bruce et al., 2009; Kleiner et al.,
2009), and pyruvate dehydrogenase kinase isozyme 4 (Pdk4),
which negatively regulates the influx of glucose-derived pyruvate
into the mitochondrial tricarboxylic acid (TCA) cycle (Luquet
et al., 2003; Wang et al., 2004). Consequently, PPARd trans-
genic mice run twice as long as the controls and represent a
permanent strain of ‘‘marathon mice’’ (Wang et al., 2004).
Conversely, muscle-specific PPARd knockout (PDmKO) mice
show defects in fiber-type determination and mitochondrial
biogenesis (Schuler et al., 2006).
In contrast to transgenesis, small molecule ligands that
specifically activate PPARd, including GW501516 (GW), have
revealed multiple beneficial metabolic effects, including (1)
increased energy expenditure (Wang et al., 2003), (2) elevated
FA oxidation (Dressel et al., 2003; Tanaka et al., 2003), (3)
reduced obesity and insulin resistance (Tanaka et al., 2003;
Wang et al., 2003), (4) exercise-induced muscle remodeling,
and, collectively, (5) enhanced running endurance by 80% or
more (Narkar et al., 2008).
Despite the above five collectanea, the minimal components
needed to enhanced running performance have eluded des-
cription. Here we show that activation of muscle PPARd not
only increases fat oxidation, but also coordinately decreases
glucose catabolism to forestall hypoglycemia and facilitate pro-
gressively longer running time. Unexpectedly, this substrate
prioritization does not depend on either oxidative fiber-type
transformation or mitochondrial biogenesis. Mechanistically,
we identify a PPARd-induced genomic signature in muscle as

 the transcriptional basis of glucose conservation and ultimately
enhanced stamina. These findings identify muscle PPARd as a
key regulator of energetic resilience and offer a quantitative mo-
lecular approach in the development of new, safe, and effective
therapeutics for the treatment of metabolic disease and the pro-
motion of metabolic health.
RESULTS
Exercise Induces a PPARd-Dependent Shift in Muscle
Energy Substrate Utilization
While endurance exercise shifts muscle energy substrate usage
from glucose to FAs (Hamilton and Booth, 2000), the depen-
dence on PPARd for this shift is not known. Accordingly, we
compared the benefits of treadmill training in wild-type (WT)
and PDmKO mice (Figure S1A). After 4 weeks of daily running,
WT mice show a clear shift in energy substrate usage from
glucose to FA oxidation, as evidenced by the reduced respira-
tory exchange ratio (RER) (Figures 1A, 1B, S1B, and S1C) and
increased palmitate-fueled mitochondrial oxygen consumption
rate (OCR) (Figure 1C). Notably, these metabolic changes are
mostly abolished in PDmKO mice (Figures 1A–1C, S1B, and
S1C), demonstrating the dependence of exercise-induced meta-
bolic adaptations on PPARd. Mechanistically, we show that
the exercise-induced upregulation of mitochondrial gatekeeper
genes (Figure 1D) is heavily compromised (Pdk4 induction
reduced by �50%; Figure 1E) or completely absent (Cpt1b; Fig-
ure 1F) in PDmKO mice. In terms of running endurance, the in-
crease in performance of PDmKO mice after exercise training
was only half that seen in WT controls (run-to-exhaustion tread-
mill test; Figure 1G). Consistent with these results, PPARd
expression in skeletal muscle positively correlates with running

 distance, activity, and muscle mass in the BXD mouse genetic
reference population (GRP) (Figure 1H) (Andreux et al., 2012;
Peirce et al., 2004). Additional negative correlations between
Cpt1b and Pdk4 expression in muscle and plasma lactate (indi-
cator for muscle glycolysis) and RER, respectively, further impli-
cate PPARd in the adaptive regulation of energy substrate
utilization (Figure S1D).
Despite the requirement for muscle PPARd in exercise-
induced metabolic adaptations and endurance enhancement,
the glycolytic-to-oxidative fiber-type switch and mitochondrial
biogenesis are still achieved in PDmKO mice (Figures S1A and
S1E–S1J). Furthermore, sedentary PDmKO mice are indistin-
guishable from WT mice in terms of mitochondrial content and
oxidative phosphorylation (OXPHOS) capacity (Figures S1A,
S1E, and S1F), as well as muscle fiber-type composition (Figures
S1E and S1G–S1J). In addition, whole-body energy expenditure
(measured as oxygen consumption rate [VO2]; Figures 1A, 1B,
S1B, and S1C), energy substrate utilization (RER; Figures 1A,
1B, S1B, and S1C), and mitochondrial FA oxidation (Figure 1C)
are all independent of muscle PPARd expression. This indicates
a role for PPARd in adaptive, but not innate, muscle activity and
stands in contrast to previous reports (Schuler et al., 2006).
Ligand Activation of Muscle PPARd Prioritizes Energy
Substrate Usage to Boost Endurance
Previous studies showed that treatment of mice with the PPARd
agonist GW dramatically increased running endurance, but only
when combined with daily exercise (Narkar et al., 2008). Based
on the above, we re-examined the impact of GW on muscle en-
ergy substrate usage and endurance in fully sedentary mice. Un-
expectedly, treatment of WT mice with GW (40 mg/kg in food) for
a longer time (8 weeks compared to 4 weeks) reduced RER to a
level similar to exercise training, indicative of increased FA meta-
bolism (Figures 2A, 2B, S2A, and S2B). Consistent with this,
palmitate-fueled respiration was �50% higher in muscle mito-
chondria isolated from GW-treated mice, while succinate-fueled
respiration was unchanged (Figures 2C and S2C). GW treatment
also more than doubled the palmitate-induced increase of OCR
in cultured C2C12 myotubes (Figures 2D and 2E). In addition,
GW strongly induced the expression of the mitochondrial gate-
keeper genes Pdk4 and Cpt1a/b both in vivo and in vitro (Figures
2F–2H) while serum lactate, an indicator of anaerobic glycolysis,
was reduced �40% in GW-treated mice (Figure S2D). Notably,
GW treatment of PDmKO mice failed to alter RER (Figures 2A,
2B, S2A, and S2B), FA oxidation in muscle mitochondria (Fig-
ure 2C), expression of muscle Pdk4 and Cpt1b (Figures 2F and
2G), or circulating lactate levels (Figure S2D), establishing that
the above effects are dependent on muscle PPARd.
Consistent with an energy substrate shift, the longer 8 week
GW treatment of sedentary mice was sufficient to confer
�1.5 hr longer running time than untreated controls (Figure 2I).
This endurance benefit is lost in PDmKO mice and thus depen-
dent on muscle PPARd activation (Figure 2I). Unexpectedly,
muscular glycogen content (Figures S2E and S2F), mitochon-
drial quantity and OXPHOS activity (Figures S2C and S2G–
S2I), and muscle fiber-type composition (Figures S2J and
S2K)—changes commonly associated with endurance enhance-
ment (Holloszy and Booth, 1976)—were not affected by GW
treatment. Thus, while establishing that ligand activation of
PPARd can enhance endurance in sedentary mice, these find-
ings implicate a novel mechanism of action.
PPARd Increases Running Endurance by Preserving
Glucose
The above data suggested a PPARd-controlled metabolic shift
that preserves systemic glucose contributing to a GW-induced
endurance enhancement. To determine the magnitude and
timing of these changes, we monitored blood glucose in mice
treated with or without GW during a run-to-exhaustion test.
As expected, both control and GW-treated mice showed
time-dependent reductions in blood glucose to <70 mg/dL, at
which point the mice stopped running and often lost conscious-
ness (Figures 2J and S2L). By increasing blood glucose
to >120 mg/dL via intraperitoneal (i.p.) injection (250 mg/kg), ex-
hausted mice were able to resume running for another �20 min,
confirming that blood glucose is the major determinant of
endurance. Interestingly, while the blood glucose in the control
mice started dropping after 90–120 min of running, GW-treated
mice were able to maintain normal glycemic levels for extended
periods and delay the onset of blood glucose reduction even
after 180 min of running (Figure 2J). It is important to note that
the glucose-sparing effects of GW treatment parallel those
seen with exercise training, suggesting a common underlying
mechanism (Figure S2M). Blood lactate was also monitored
during our run-to-exhaustion tests, which showed minimal fluc-
tuation in both control and GW-treated mice (Figure 2J,
dashed lines; Figure S2N), indicating that the endurance
regimen did not exceed the aerobic threshold of the tested
mice. In combination, our data describe a PPARd-controlled
muscle reprogramming that boosts exercise endurance by
inversely regulating fat and glucose metabolism, thereby pre-
serving circulating glucose to support other tissues such as
the brain (Figure 2K).
PPARd Orchestrates Mitochondrial Gene Networks
Global transcriptional analyses in the glycolytic white quadri-
ceps muscle (WQ) identified 975 genes with altered expression
upon GW treatment, with 492 up- and 483 downregulated. In
addition to the key mitochondrial genes Pdk4 and Cpt1b
described above (Figures 2F and 2G), gene ontology (GO) anal-
ysis of upregulated genes revealed significant enrichment in the
PPAR signaling pathway as well as lipid and FA catabolism
(including Lpl, Lipe, Acadl, Acads, and Acaa2) (Figures 3A,
3B, and S3A). Interestingly, lipogenic genes including PPARg
(master adipogenic regulator) and FA synthase (Fasn) were
also induced (Figures 3A, 3B, and S3A), which would theoreti-
cally lead to a futile cycle of lipid catabolism and anabolism.
Additionally, genes involved in antioxidant defense and gluta-
thione synthesis (including Cat, Sod3, and Gpx1) were highly
upregulated (Figures 3A, 3B, and S3A). Counterintuitively, path-
ways in carbohydrate metabolism, including the hexose meta-
bolic process, pentose-phosphate shunt, and insulin signaling,
were also significantly enriched (Figures 3A, 3B, and S3A).
However, the induction of Fbp2, Pck1, and Pcx (Figure 3B)
is consistent with the induction of an anabolic program, sug-
gesting a possible role in muscle repair.
Conversely, pathways of insulin signaling, glycolysis, and
carbohydrate catabolism were significantly enriched in the
1188
Cell Metabolism 25, 1186–1193, May 2, 2017
 downregulated gene set (including Irs2, Slc2a3, and Hk2)
(Figures 3A, 3C, and S3B). Notably, these transcriptional
changes, combined with the suppression of the recently
identified mitochondrial pyruvate carrier Mpc1, coordinately
reduce muscle glucose catabolism (Figures 3A, 3C, and
S3B). These studies reveal that PPARd reprograms muscle
metabolism for endurance by reciprocal regulation of gene
programs promoting FA oxidation and suppressing glucose
metabolism (Figure 3D).
Ligand Remodeling of the PPARd Cistrome
Chromatin immunoprecipitation coupled with deep sequencing
(ChIP-seq) was used to establish the PPARd cistrome in both
the presence and absence of ligand. In C2C12 cells, 8,474 and
10,482 PPARd binding sites were identified in vehicle- and
GW-treated cells, respectively (Figure 4A). Motif analysis identi-
fied a consensus PPAR response element significantly enriched
in both conditions (Figure 4A), confirming the quality of the ChIP.
A total of 5,586 binding sites were common to both vehicle- and

 GW-treated cells, with GW recruiting an additional 4,896 unique
sites and dismissing 2,888 pre-ligand sites. PPARd binding sites
were predominantly located in the intergenic and intronic re-
gions, with only 4% in gene promoter regions (Figure 4B), as
seen with many transcription factors.
Correlating the PPARd cistrome with the ligand-induced tran-
scriptional changes (Figures 3 and S3) revealed that �50% of
GW-regulated genes (457 of 975 genes) were direct PPARd
target genes (based on proximity of binding sites to the closest
transcription start site), with roughly equivalent numbers of these
genes up- and downregulated (223 and 234, respectively; Fig-
ure 4C). Furthermore, GO analysis of the 457 directly regulated
genes showed enrichment of the same categories as seen in
the entire GW transcriptome, including FA metabolism in upre-
gulated and glucose catabolism in downregulated gene sets
(Figures 3A, S3, and 4C). In contrast, the 518 indirect PPARd
target genes failed to show any significant GO enrichment. The
marked overlap between the transcriptomic and cistromic find-
ings supports a direct role for PPARd-regulated transcriptional
changes in both exercise- and ligand-induced adaptations in
energy substrate utilization.
Interestingly, PPARd employs distinct mechanisms to regulate
target genes. Only a subset of genes showed increased PPARd
chromatin binding upon ligand treatment (e.g., Pdk4 and Mlycd,
in contrast to Cpt1a, Slc25a20, Angptl4, and Ucp3, where PPARd
binding wasindependent ofligand) (Figures 4D–4F).Further inves-
tigation of the latter gene set revealed both ligand-induced loss of
co-repressor binding (loss of NCoR binding on Angptl4 and Ucp3)
and ligand-induced recruitment of co-activator (increased Pgc1a
binding on Cpt1a and Slc25a20) (Figures 4G and 4H).
AMPK Activation Is Insufficient to Induce a
Metabolic Shift
Previously, a functional interaction between PPARd and AMPK
was suggested based on a synergistic induction of FA meta-
bolism genes by co-treatment with GW and the AMPK activator
AICAR, an effect that was dependent on PPARd (Narkar et al.,
2008). To explore the regulatory hierarchy controlling metabolic
substrate utilization, we determined the effects of AICAR treat-
ment on PPARd target genes (Figures 3A and 3B). AICAR alone
did not significantly activate PPARd target genes involved in FA
metabolism, except for the induction of Pparg, in agreement with
an earlier study (Figures S4A and S4B). Furthermore, AICAR
failed to repress glucose catabolism genes (Figure S4A). Consis-
tent with this lack of transcriptional changes, 8 weeks of AICAR
treatment did not alter substrate utilization in mice (Figure S4C).
AICAR treatment did increase energy expenditure in mice, pre-
sumably through mitochondrial biogenesis (Figures S4C and
S4D). Notably, the ability of AICAR to induce mitochondrial
biogenesis is independent of PPARd (Figure S4D), in line with
the data that PPARd activation or depletion did not affect mito-
chondrial biogenesis (Figure S2G).
DISCUSSION
In endurance sport competitions such cycling, marathon runs,
race walking, and cross-country skiing, ‘‘hitting the wall’’ is a dra-
matic demonstration of sudden and complete exhaustion. It is
thought to be due to the depletion of liver and muscle glycogen
and can be averted by training that promotes mitochondrial
biogenesis, increased type I fibers, and enhanced FA burning.

 In this study, we show that PPARd expression correlates with
endurance, and its activation by exercise mimetics, such as
GW, is sufficient to increase running time by �100 min without
changes in either muscle fiber type or mitochondrial biogenesis.
Thus, the foundational core of endurance enhancement appears
to be purely metabolic. Furthermore, even though the GW
impact appears to be achieved via increased FA metabolism,
the strongest correlation to endurance is maintenance of blood
glucose above 70 mg/dL. Indeed, expression of key glycolytic
genes such as Hk2, Gck, and the recently described mitochon-
drial pyruvate carrier (Mcp1) is dramatically reduced.
Activation of muscle PPARd either genetically or pharmaco-
logically is sufficient to dramatically improve endurance capa-
city. However, fiber-type changes and mitochondrial biogenesis
found in the PPARd transgenic models (Luquet et al., 2003;
Wang et al., 2004) were not seen in ‘‘ligand-only’’ activation.
Instead, we find that PPARd ligand prioritizes energy substrate
usage to increase FA catabolism while lowering glycolysis with
the net effect of preserving systemic glucose (Figure 2K).
This PPARd-directed metabolic shift is driven by the induction
of a metabolic gene signature change, which includes not only
the induction of the mitochondrial gatekeeper genes Cpt1b
and Pdk4, but also the upregulation of genes in FA transport,
FA oxidation, lipogenesis, and gluconeogenesis, and the down-
regulation of genes in glucose uptake, glycolysis, and mitochon-
drial pyruvate entry. Overall, these gene expression changes

 promoted the metabolic shift in energy substrate from glucose
to FA in the muscle. Antioxidant genes, as well as genes in
glutathione synthesis, were also significantly induced by GW
treatment, which could protect against increased reactive
oxidative species (ROS) due to elevated mitochondrial energy
metabolism.
Our study reveals the molecular mechanism underlying mus-
cle PPARd regulation of its target genes. We show that ligand
activation recruits PPARd to new cis regulatory elements on its
target genes. In addition, at sites where PPARd is naturally
bound, ligand binding modifies its interaction with co-activators
or co-repressors for target gene regulation (Yamamoto et al.,
2011). Our data also suggested PPARd as the direct executor
in GW-induced gene expression changes, since �50% of the
GW-induced genes contain PPARd binding sites. In those
PPARd bound genes, about half were upregulated and half
downregulated upon GW activation, suggesting PPARd could
both directly activate and suppress downstream genes in a
ligand-dependent manner, a circumstance observed for other
nuclear receptor members such as PPARg (Duan et al., 2008).
The importance of muscle PPARd in regulating energy meta-
bolism has been further confirmed by the correlation study in
38 BXD mouse lines. We observed strong correlations between
PPARd target gene expression and metabolic fitness. As a nu-
clear receptor, the transcription activity of PPARd is regulated
by its endogenous ligands. Its activity, rather than its own
expression level, controls its target gene expression. In support
of this, exercise training highly induced the expression of PPARd
target genes such as Cpt1b and Pdk4 but had no effect on
PPARd itself in skeletal muscle.
This work identifies PPARd as both the master regulator and
key executor of adaptive changes in energy substrate use in
skeletal muscle. Notably, pharmacologic activation of PPARd
replicates the exercise-induced changes in substrate utilization
to preserve systemic glucose and thereby delay the onset of hy-
poglycemia, or ‘‘hitting the wall.’’ While exercise-induced muscle
remodeling is well documented, the health benefits have been
largely attributed to mitochondrial biogenesis and fiber-type
transformation (Fan and Evans, 2017). In contrast, pharmaco-
phores that activate PPARd promote endurance through preser-
ving glucose, essentially ‘‘pushing back the wall,’’ without
affecting mitochondrial biogenesis or fiber-type transformation.
This ability to chemically activate energetic circuits regulated
by PPARd has the potential to confer health benefits in a variety
of human diseases.

C2C12 myoblasts were cultured in DMEM supplemented with 20% FBS. All C2C12 in vitro experiments were performed in differen-
tiated myotubes, after 5 days of differentiation in DMEM supplemented with 2% horse serum. Primary myoblasts were isolated
from Ppardfl/fl mice and the knockout of Ppard was achieved by the transfection of adenovirus expressing Cre recombinase (Vector
Biolabs Cat 1700). Primary myotube formation was induced by 2 days of culture in DMEM supplemented with 2% horse serum.
METHOD DETAILS
Animal studies
Prior to training or exhaustion running, mice were pre-adapted to the treadmill for 20 min per day for 3 days at a gradually increased
speed (5 to 10 m/min). Daily exercise training was achieved with one hour of forced running on a rodent treadmill (Harvard Apparatus)
at a speed of 10 m/min. The same treadmill was used for the run-to-exhaustion test, which included 10 min of adaptive period with a
gradually increasing speed from 10 to 15 m/min followed by the exhaustion run at 15 m/min till mice failed. Blood glucose and lactate
levels were measured using a glucometer (Nova max) and a Lactate Scout analyzer (EKF Diagnostic) with tail-nip bleeding.
GW501516 was administered through customized diets (Envigo) at the concentration of 40mg/kg. Energy expenditure (VO2), RER
(VCO2/VO2), and activity were monitored with the CLAMS/Oxymax system (Columbus Instruments). Body temperature was
measured with a rectal thermometer (Thermoworks) and an infrared camera (FLIR). All animal protocols were reviewed and approved
by the Institute of Animal Care and Use Committee (IACUC) of their respective institutes, and studies were conducted in compliance
with institutional and national guidelines.
Western blotting
Freshly frozen quadriceps muscle was pulverized in liquid nitrogen. About 50mg of muscle powder was weighed and proteins ex-
tracted with the ProPrep protein extraction solution (Bulldog Bio, 17081). Protein concentration was measured with the Pierce
BCA protein assay kit (Thermo Fisher, 23225). 20 mg of total proteins was loaded onto 4%–12% gradient NuPAGE Bis-Tris gels
(Invitrogen) and run for 1.5 hr at 120V. Proteins were transferred to nitrocellulose membranes (Biorad). After one-hour blocking in
5% milk PBST (0.1% Tween 20) solution, membranes were incubated overnight at 4�C with in-house developed guinea pig
anti-PPARd and commercial PGC1a (Abcam ab54481), Tom20 (Cell Signaling 42406), and HSP90 (Cell Signaling 4877) antibodies,
followed by 3x 5 min washes in PBST, 1 hr incubation in secondary HRP antibodies, and 3x 5 min washes in PBST. SuperSignal West
Pico (Thermo 34080) was used to develop the signals.
Seahorse Bioanalyzer
For Seahorse analysis (XF96, Agilent Technologies), C2C12 myoblasts were seeded at a density of 104/well in XF96 plates. After
4 days of differentiation, cells were treated overnight with vehicle (DMSO) or GW501516 (0.2 mM). OCR and ECAR were next
measured following manufacturer’s instructions with the injection of Seahorse XF Palmitate-BSA FAO Substrate (Agilent Technolo-
gies) and Seahorse XF Cell Mito Stress Test Kit (Agilent Technologies).
Immunohistochemistry and histochemistry
Gastrocnemius, soleus, and plantaris muscles were dissected and freshly frozen in liquid N2-cooled isopentane. 10 mm cryosections
were prepared using a cryostat (Zeiss). Sections were dried at RT (room temperature) for 30 min and stored in �80�C or directly used
for stainings. For immunohistochemistry, sections were blocked in 5% GS/PBST (5% goat serum in PBST) for 1 hr at RT and incu-
bated overnight at 4�C with a mixture of three primary mouse monoclonal antibodies in 5% GS/PBST against MYH7 (BA-F8, IgG2b),
MYH2 (SC-71, IgG1), and MYH4 (BF-F3, IgM), obtained from DSHB at the University of Iowa. After 3x 5 min washes in PBST, sections
were incubated for one hour with a mixture of three goat anti-mouse secondary antibodies against IgG2b (Alexa 350), IgG1 (Alexa
488), and IgM (Alexa 555) in 5% GS/PBST, followed by 3x 5 min washes in PBST. Sections were then mounted with ProLong
Gold Anti-fade mountant (Thermo Fisher) and sealed with nail polish. For histochemical mitochondrial complex I and IV activity stain-
ing, sections were incubated at RT for 15 min in freshly prepared complex I assay solution (100mM Tris (pH 7.1), 1mg/ml nitro blue
tertrazolium, and 1mg/ml NADH) or complex IV assay solution (200mM NaH2PO4 (pH 7.4), 7.5mg/ml sucrose, 2ug/ml catalase,
1.5mg/ml cytochrome c, and 1mg/ml DAB). Sections were washed in distilled water and mounted in Permount (Thermo Fisher).
For glycogen staining, a Periodic Acid-Schiff (PAS) staining system (MilliporeSigma, 395B) was used following the manufacturer’s
manual and mounted with Permount. All sections were imaged with an Olympus VS-120 Virtual Slide Scanning Microscope.
Mitochondrial isolation and analysis
Mitochondria were isolated from freshly dissected quadriceps muscle using a mitochondrial isolation kit following the manufacturer’s
manual (MilliporeSigma, MITOISO1). Mitochondrial protein concentration was measured using a BCA assay. 50ug of freshly isolated
mitochondria was added to each well in a Seahorse XF96 plate and pelleted by 30 min of centrifugation at 4�C at the speed of 3000 g.
OCR was measured using the Seahorse XF96 bioanalyzer and the XF96 assay kit (Agilent Technologies) following manufacturer’s
protocol with either succinate or palmitoyl-carnitine as the energy substrate. The activities of citrate synthase and mitochondrial
complex I, II+III, and IV, were measured using spectrophotometric enzyme assays (Fan et al., 2011). Specifically, freshly isolated
mitochondria were disrupted with 3 cycles of freeze-and-thaw and immediately used to detect complex I, II+III, IV, and citrate

 synthase activities by spectrophotometric assays. Complex I activity was measured as the rate of NADH oxidation at 340 nm. A re-
action containing 400 mL water, 500 mL 2x Buffer (500 mM sucrose, 2 mM EDTA, 100 mM Tris-HCl, pH 7.4), 10 mL 10 mM decylubi-
quinone (DB, Sigma), 1 mL 2M KCN, and 20ug mitochondria, was incubated at 30�C for 5 min. 50 mL 1mM NADH was then added to
trigger the reaction, and absorption at 340 nm was measured for 5 min for total complex I activity. A parallel experiment was per-
formed in the presence of 5 mL 1 mg/ml rotenone to measure rotenone-insensitive complex I activity. Complex II+III activity was
measured as the rate of cytochrome c (cyt c) reduction at 550 nm. A reaction was set up containing 550 mL water, 400 mL
100 mM potassium phosphate buffer (pH 7.4), 20 mL 1 M succinate, 1 mL 0.5 M EDTA, 1 mL 2M KCN, and 30 mL 1 mM cyt c.
10 mg mitochondria was then added and the absorption at 550 nm was monitored for 2 min for complex II+III activity. Complex IV
activity was measured as the rate of cytochrome c (cyt c) oxidation at 550 nm. A reaction was set up containing 850 mL water,
100 mL 100 mM potassium phosphate buffer (pH 7.4), and 50 mL 1 mM reduced cyt c. 2 mg mitochondria was then added and the
absorption at 550 nm was monitored for 2 min for complex IV activity. To reduce cyt c, 2 mL 1 M dithiothreitol (DTT) was added to
1 mL 1 mM cyt c and was ready to use after a 15 min incubation. Citrate synthase activity was measured as the reduction of
DTNB at 412 nm. A reaction was set up containing 800 mL water, 100 mL 1 M Tris-HCl (pH 8.0), 50 mL 6 mM Acetyl-CoA, and
10 mL 10 mM DTNB. 10 mg mitochondria was then added and the absorption at 412 nm was monitored for 2 min for citrate synthase
activity.
RNA analysis
Total RNAs were extracted from the glycolytic white quadriceps muscle or C2C12 myotubes with Trizol (Invitrogen) and the RNeasy
Mini kit with on-column DNase treatment (QIAGEN). RNA quality was confirmed using the Agilent 2100 Bioanalyzer and RNA-Seq
libraries prepared using the TruSeq RNA Sample Preparation Kit v2 according to Illumina protocol. Multiplexed libraries were
validated using the Agilent BioAnalyzer, normalized and pooled for sequencing. High-throughput sequencing was performed on
the Hiseq 2000 system (Illumina) with a 100-bp read length. For quantitative PCR (qPCR) analysis, 1 mg of RNA was reverse tran-
scribed using the iScript supermix (Biorad) and qPCR performed with specific primer pairs and the SYBR Green Master Mix on
the CFX384 system (Biorad).
Chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP) analysis
Each ChIP was performed in 4x107 cells using a previously described protocol (Barish et al., 2010). Briefly, C2C12 myotubes were
crosslinked with 1% freshly prepared formaldehyde in PBS for 10 min at room temperature. After glycine neutralization, cells were
harvested and nuclei were isolated, lysed and sheared with the Diagenode Bioruptor to yield DNA fragment sizes of 200–500 base
pairs followed by immunoprecipitation using the following antibodies: normal guinea pig IgG, in-house developed guinea pig anti-
PPARd and NcoR antibodies, normal rabbit IgG, and rabbit anti- PGC1a antibody (Abcam ab54481). DNA was next extracted and
subjected to either qPCR or ChIP-seq library preparation using the NEXTflex Illumina ChIP-Seq Library Prep Kit (Bioo Scientific).
High-throughput sequencing was performed on the Hiseq 2000 system (Illumina) with a 50-bp read length.
Glycogen assay
Glycogen was measured using a commercial kit (BioVision K646-100) following manufacturer’s instructions. Snap-frozen muscles
were ground using a mortar and pestle in liquid N2, and weighed tissue powder lysed in the provided buffer. Tissue lysate was
then assayed for glycogen content.
QUANTIFICATION AND STATISTICAL ANALYSIS
ANOVA and post hoc analysis was used to evaluate statistical significance in studies using four groups of samples. For studies with
only two samples, unpaired t test was used instead. For RNA-Seq, image analysis and base calling were done with Illumina CASAVA-
1.8.2. Short read sequences were mapped to a UCSC mm9 reference sequence using the RNA-Seq aligner STAR (Dobin et al., 2013).
Known splice junctions from mm9 were supplied to the aligner and de novo junction discovery was also permitted. Differential gene
expression analysis, statistical testing and annotation were performed using Cuffdiff 2 (Trapnell et al., 2013). Transcript expression
was calculated as gene-level relative abundance in fragments per kilobase of exon model per million mapped fragments and em-
ployed correction for transcript abundance bias (Roberts et al., 2011). Results for genes of interest were also explored visually using
the UCSC Genome Browser. For ChIP-Seq, short DNA reads were demultiplexed using Illumina CASAVA v1.8.2. Reads were aligned
against the mouse mm9 using the Bowtie aligner allowing up to 2 mismatches in the read. Only tags that map uniquely to the genome
were considered for further analysis. Subsequent peak calling and motif analysis were conducted using HOMER, a software suite for
ChIP-Seq analysis. The methods for HOMER, which are described below, have been implemented and are freely available at http://
homer.ucsd.edu/homer/. One tag from each unique position was considered to eliminate peaks resulting from clonal amplification of
fragments during the ChIP-Seq protocol. Peaks were identified by searching for clusters of tags within a sliding 200 bp window,
requiring adjacent clusters to be at least 1 kb away from each other. The threshold for the number of tags that determine a valid
peak was selected for a false discovery rate of < 0.01, as empirically determined by repeating the peak finding procedure using ran-
domized tag positions. Peaks are required to have at least 4-fold more tags (normalized to total count) than input or IgG control sam-
ples and 4-fold more tags relative to the local background region (10 kb) to avoid identifying regions with genomic duplications or
non-localized binding. Peaks are annotated to gene products by identifying the nearest RefSeq transcriptional start site. Visualization

ysis was performed with the DAVID functional annotation tool (https://david.ncifcrf.gov). The BXD correlation analysis was based on
the Spearman’s rho and performed in R as previously described (Andreux et al., 2012).
