BACKGROUND
Degludec is an ultralong-acting, once-daily basal insulin that is approved for use in 
adults, adolescents, and children with diabetes. Previous open-label studies have shown 
lower day-to-day variability in the glucose-lowering effect and lower rates of hypogly-
cemia among patients who received degludec than among those who received basal 
insulin glargine. However, data are lacking on the cardiovascular safety of degludec.
METHODS
We randomly assigned 7637 patients with type 2 diabetes to receive either insulin 
degludec (3818 patients) or insulin glargine U100 (3819 patients) once daily between 
dinner and bedtime in a double-blind, treat-to-target, event-driven cardiovascular out-
comes trial. The primary composite outcome in the time-to-event analysis was the first 
occurrence of an adjudicated major cardiovascular event (death from cardiovascular 
causes, nonfatal myocardial infarction, or nonfatal stroke) with a prespecified non-
inferiority margin of 1.3. Adjudicated severe hypoglycemia, as defined by the American 
Diabetes Association, was the prespecified, multiplicity-adjusted secondary outcome.
RESULTS
Of the patients who underwent randomization, 6509 (85.2%) had established cardio-
vascular disease, chronic kidney disease, or both. At baseline, the mean age was 65.0 
years, the mean duration of diabetes was 16.4 years, and the mean (±SD) glycated 
hemoglobin level was 8.4±1.7%; 83.9% of the patients were receiving insulin. The 
primary outcome occurred in 325 patients (8.5%) in the degludec group and in 356 
(9.3%) in the glargine group (hazard ratio, 0.91; 95% confidence interval, 0.78 to 
1.06; P<0.001 for noninferiority). At 24 months, the mean glycated hemoglobin level 
was 7.5±1.2% in each group, whereas the mean fasting plasma glucose level was sig-
nificantly lower in the degludec group than in the glargine group (128±56 vs. 136±57 
mg per deciliter, P<0.001). Prespecified adjudicated severe hypoglycemia occurred in 
187 patients (4.9%) in the degludec group and in 252 (6.6%) in the glargine group, 
for an absolute difference of 1.7 percentage points (rate ratio, 0.60; P<0.001 for su-
periority; odds ratio, 0.73; P<0.001 for superiority). Rates of adverse events did not 
differ between the two groups.
CONCLUSIONS
Among patients with type 2 diabetes at high risk for cardiovascular events, degludec 
was noninferior to glargine with respect to the incidence of major cardiovascular events.

ardiovascular complications re-
main two to four times more common 
among patients with type 2 diabetes than 
among persons without diabetes.1 Observational 
studies have suggested that patients with type 2 
diabetes who require insulin have increased rates 
of cardiovascular events.1-3 However, a large clini-
cal trial involving patients with impaired fasting 
glucose levels, impaired glucose tolerance, or type 
2 diabetes reported cardiovascular outcomes 
among those who received basal insulin glargine 
that were similar to outcomes among patients who 
received standard care.4
Degludec is an ultralong-acting, once-daily 
basal insulin approved for use in adults, adoles-
cents, and children with diabetes.5-7 Previous open-
label studies have shown lower day-to-day vari-
ability in the glucose-lowering effect and lower 
rates of hypoglycemia among the patients who 
received degludec than among those who received 
glargine.8,9 The Food and Drug Administration 
(FDA) required that a dedicated preapproval trial of 
cardiovascular outcomes be conducted to assess 
the cardiovascular safety of degludec, as compared 
with glargine. Consequently, we conducted the 
Trial Comparing Cardiovascular Safety of Insulin 
Degludec versus Insulin Glargine in Patients with 
Type 2 Diabetes at High Risk of Cardiovascular 
Events (DEVOTE).
Methods
Trial Design and Oversight
Detailed methods of the trial have been published 
previously.10 Briefly, the trial was a treat-to-target, 
randomized, double-blind, active comparator–con-
trolled cardiovascular outcomes trial that was 
conducted at 438 sites in 20 countries. The trial 
was designed to continue until the occurrence of 
at least 633 primary outcome events, as confirmed 
by central, blinded review by an independent event-
adjudication committee.
The trial was conducted in accordance with 
the provisions of the Declaration of Helsinki and 
the International Conference on Harmonisation 
Good Clinical Practice Guidelines.11,12 The proto-
col (available with the full text of this article at 
NEJM.org) was approved by the independent eth-
ics committee or institutional review board at each 
trial center. Written informed consent was obtained 
from each patient before any trial-related activities.
The trial was funded and conducted by Novo 
Nordisk. Statogen Consulting and Novo Nordisk 
both independently analyzed the data only after 
the database lock. The steering committee, which 
was composed of the authors, participated in de-
signing the trial, analyzing the data, editing an 
earlier version of the manuscript, and making 
the decision to submit the manuscript for publi-
cation. Medical writing and editorial support were 
funded by the sponsor. The authors had full access 
to all the trial data and vouch for the completeness 
and integrity of the data and for the fidelity of the 
trial to the protocol.
A prespecified interim analysis was planned, 
for regulatory purposes as agreed with the FDA, 
to assess the noninferiority of degludec versus 
glargine for cardiovascular safety after the occur-
rence of 150 primary outcome events, as con-
firmed by the event-adjudication committee.10 Per 
regulatory guidance, the confirmation of an upper 
limit of the confidence interval below 1.8 at the 
interim analysis was required to establish non-
inferiority and allow confidential FDA review.10 
On the basis of the results of the submitted in-
terim analysis, the FDA approved the use of de-
gludec in the United States in September 2015.
To mitigate the potential risk that an interim 
analysis posed to the overall integrity of the trial, 
a data-access management plan was developed 
before the interim analysis and is described in 
detail in the Supplementary Appendix, available 
at NEJM.org.10 The conduct of the trial was over-
seen by a steering committee that consisted of aca-
demic investigators and Novo Nordisk employees. 
In addition, an independent external data and 
safety monitoring committee was established to 
review accumulated data and evaluate the risk–
benefit balance at planned intervals. An external 
independent statistics group, Statistics Collab-
orative, provided unblinded data to the data and 
safety monitoring committee, which could recom-
mend to continue, modify, or terminate the trial 
prematurely on the basis of criteria developed be-
fore the initiation of the trial. Operational advice 
for the trial was provided by the global expert 
panel throughout the trial.
Patients and Treatments
Patients with type 2 diabetes who were at high 
risk for cardiovascular events were randomly as-
signed in a 1:1 ratio to receive either degludec or 
glargine (both in identical 10-ml vials containing 
100 U per milliliter), with each drug added to stan-

dard care and administered once daily between 
dinner and bedtime. Eligible patients included 
those who were being treated with at least one 
oral or injectable antihyperglycemic agent. Also 
required was a glycated hemoglobin level of 7% 
or more while the patients were receiving the anti-
hyperglycemic agent; if the level was less than 7%, 
treatment with at least 20 units of basal insulin 
per day was required. Two groups of patients were 
eligible for the trial: those who were 50 years of 
age or older who had at least one coexisting 
cardiovascular or renal condition and those who 
were 60 years of age or older who had at least 
one cardiovascular risk factor. A complete list of 
inclusion and exclusion criteria is provided in the 
Supplementary Appendix.
Patients could continue their pretrial antihyper-
glycemic therapy except for basal and premix in-
sulins, which were discontinued. Patients adjusted 
their dose of basal insulin weekly on the basis of 
the lowest of three self-measured blood-glucose 
values, as measured before breakfast 2 days before 
and on the day of dose adjustment, with the aim 
of reaching a target of 71 to 90 mg per deciliter 
(4.0 to 5.0 mmol per liter) (Table S1 in the Sup-
plementary Appendix). To safeguard vulnerable 
patients, an alternative blood-glucose target of 
90 to 126 mg per deciliter (5.0 to 7.0 mmol per 
liter) was available for these patients. Bolus in-
sulin (aspart) was provided by Novo Nordisk for 
patients who were either continuing or initiating 
bolus treatment during the trial, with weekly ad-
justments based on the lowest of three prepran-
dial or bedtime self-measured blood-glucose values 
measured on the 3 days before dose adjustment 
and aiming to reach a target of 71 to 126 mg per 
deciliter (Table S1 in the Supplementary Appen-
dix). Higher targets were allowed at the discretion 
of the investigator.
The following events were adjudicated by the 
event-adjudication committee in a blinded manner: 
acute coronary syndrome (defined as myocardial 
infarction or unstable angina pectoris leading to 
hospitalization), stroke, death, and severe hypo-
glycemia. The definitions that were used for the 
clinical-event adjudication are provided in the 
Supplementary Appendix. Neoplasms were clas-
sified by a blinded independent committee as 
malignant, benign, or not classifiable. For neo-
plasms that were classified as malignant, a further 
subclassification was performed to assess the pri-
mary organ site.
Outcomes
All outcomes were prespecified unless otherwise 
stated. The primary composite outcome in the 
time-to-event analysis was the first occurrence of 
death from cardiovascular causes, nonfatal myo-
cardial infarction, or nonfatal stroke. The multi-
plicity-adjusted confirmatory secondary outcomes 
were the number and incidence of adjudicated 
events of severe hypoglycemia, which was defined 
by the American Diabetes Association as an epi-
sode requiring the assistance of another person 
to actively administer carbohydrate or glucagon 
or to take other corrective actions.13 According to 
this definition, plasma glucose levels may not be 
available during an event, but neurologic recovery 
after the return of plasma glucose to a normal 
level is considered to be sufficient evidence that 
the event was induced by a low plasma glucose 
level.
Other secondary outcomes included an ex-
panded composite cardiovascular outcome (the 
primary composite outcome or unstable angina 
leading to hospitalization) and the time from ran-
domization to death from any cause, along with 
serious adverse events or adverse events leading to 
discontinuation of the intervention, levels of gly-
cated hemoglobin and fasting plasma glucose, 
blood pressure, pulse, lipid measurements, weight, 
body-mass index, estimated glomerular filtration 
rate, nocturnal severe hypoglycemia (occurring 
between 12:01 a.m. and 5:59 a.m.), and basal and 
bolus insulin dose. Glycated hemoglobin was mea-
sured at randomization, at months 3, 6, 9, and 12, 
and yearly thereafter. Other laboratory tests were 
performed at randomization and yearly thereafter.
Statistical Analysis
The statistical analysis plan is available in the 
Supplementary Appendix. Details regarding the 
sample-size estimates and statistical analyses have 
been published previously.10 We estimated that 
the follow-up of 7500 patients for approximately 
5 years with an assumed event rate of 2.1 per 
100 patient-years of exposure would produce 633 
events and hence a power of 91% to rule on the 
null hypothesis. A Cox proportional-hazards re-
gression model was used to analyze the intention-
to-treat population for the primary composite 
outcome to test for the noninferiority of de-
gludec as compared with glargine. Noninferior-
ity would be confirmed if the upper boundary of 
the 95% confidence interval was less than 1.3. If

noninferiority was established, we then tested for 
superiority with respect to severe hypoglycemic 
episodes using a negative binomial-regression 
model that was adjusted for observation time 
and treatment group to test for the number of 
events and a logistic-regression model that was 
adjusted for treatment group to test for incidence. 
Superiority of these secondary outcomes would 
be confirmed if the upper boundary of the 95% 
confidence interval was less than 1.0. Selected 
sensitivity analyses, including the per-protocol 
analysis, were performed to address the robust-
ness of the results. The rationale for the use of 
a noninferiority threshold of 1.3 in the primary 
analysis and a threshold of 1.8 in the interim 
analysis is described in the Supplementary Ap-
pendix.
Results
Patients
From November 2013 through November 2014, a 
total of 7637 patients were randomly assigned to 
receive either degludec (3818 patients) or glargine 
(3819 patients) once daily (Fig. S1 in the Supple-
mentary Appendix). Of these patients, 98% com-
pleted the final follow-up visit or died during the 
trial (Fig. S2 in the Supplementary Appendix). 
The vital status was known for 99.9% of the pa-
tients. Five patients (0.06%) were lost to follow-up, 
and three patients (0.04%) had withdrawn consent 
at the time of the database lock. The median ob-
servation time was 1.99 years, and the median ex-
posure time was 1.83 years.
The characteristics of the patients at base-
line were similar in the two groups (Table S2 in 
the Supplementary Appendix). Of the 7637 pa-
tients, 6509 (85.2%) had established cardiovas-
cular disease or moderate chronic kidney disease. 
The mean age was 65.0 years, the mean dura-
tion of diabetes was 16.4 years, and the mean 
(±SD) glycated hemoglobin level was 8.4±1.7%. 
Of the 6409 patients (83.9%) who were receiv-
ing insulin at baseline, 3515 (54.8%) were re-
ceiving a basal–bolus regimen.
Cardiovascular Outcomes
The primary composite outcome occurred in 325 
patients (8.5%) in the degludec group and in 356 
patients (9.3%) in the glargine group (hazard ra-
tio, 0.91; 95% confidence interval [CI], 0.78 to 1.06; 
P<0.001 for noninferiority in a one-sided test) (Ta-
ble 1 and Fig. 1A). Individual components of the 
composite cardiovascular outcome are provided 
in Table 1 and Figures 1B, 1C, and 1D. There 
was no significant difference in the incidence of 
death in the degludec and glargine groups (202 
patients [5.3%] vs. 221 patients [5.8%]; hazard 
ratio, 0.91; 95% CI, 0.76 to 1.11; P 
= 
0.35).
The results of various sensitivity analyses that 
used alternative censoring methods were aligned 
with the findings of the primary analysis and 
are shown, along with the subgroup analyses, in 
Figures S3 and S4 in the Supplementary Appen-
dix. Findings for the remaining adjudicated cardio-
vascular outcomes and the expanded composite 
outcome are shown in Figure S5 in the Supplemen-
tary Appendix.
Severe Hypoglycemia
A total of 752 severe hypoglycemic events oc-
curred, 280 events in 187 patients in the degludec 
group and 472 events in 252 patients in the 
glargine group; the rate was 3.70 events per 
100 patient-years in the degludec group and 6.25 
events per 100 patient-years in the glargine group 
(rate ratio, 0.60; 95% CI, 0.48 to 0.76; P<0.001 
for superiority) (Table 2 and Fig. 2A). One or more 
events of severe hypoglycemia13 occurred in 187 
patients (4.9%) in the degludec group and in 252 
(6.6%) in the glargine group, for an absolute dif-
ference of 1.7 percentage points (odds ratio, 0.73; 
95% CI, 0.60 to 0.89; P<0.001 for superiority) 
(Table 2). Of the 752 severe hypoglycemic 
events that occurred in the two groups, blood-
glucose measurements were available for 637 
events (84.7%) (Fig. S6 in the Supplementary 
Appendix). In addition, there was a lower rate 
of nocturnal severe hypoglycemia in the degludec 
group than in the glargine group (0.65 vs. 1.40 
events per 100 patient-years) for a rate ratio of 
0.47 (95% CI, 0.31 to 0.73; P<0.001) (Table 2 
and Fig. 2B).
The results of the on-treatment analyses were 
similar to those in the primary analyses (Figs. 
S7 and S8 in the Supplementary Appendix). The 
results of subgroup analyses are shown in Figure 
S9 in the Supplementary Appendix. Treatment 
ratios differed significantly in subgroups defined 
according to sex, ethnic group (Hispanic or La-
tino vs. not Hispanic or Latino), cardiovascular 
risk group (established cardiovascular disease vs. 
risk factors), and trial center (United States vs. 
other countries in DEVOTE).

Efficacy and Safety of Degludec in Type 2 Diabetes
Glycemic Control
There was no significant between-group differ-
ence in total and bolus insulin dose levels over 
time (Fig. S10 in the Supplementary Appendix). 
For basal insulin, the estimated dose of degludec 
was 2 units higher than the dose of glargine 
(estimated treatment ratio, 1.04; 95% CI, 1.00 to 
1.08; P 
= 
0.04) at 24 months (Fig. S11 in the 
Supplementary Appendix). Overall initiation of 
concomitant antihyperglycemic medications dur-
ing the trial was similar in the two groups (Ta-
ble S3 in the Supplementary Appendix).
There also was no significant between-group 
difference in changes in glycated hemoglobin 
levels throughout the trial (Fig. 2C). At 24 
months, the glycated hemoglobin level was 7.5% 
(58 mmol per mole) in the two groups, with an 
estimated treatment difference of 0.01 percent-
age points (95% CI, –0.05 to 0.07; P 
= 
0.78 in post 
hoc analysis). Over 24 months, plasma glucose 
values that were measured by the patients before 
breakfast were similar in the two groups; the me-
dian value for all patients was 95 mg per deciliter 
(5.3 mmol per liter) (Fig. S12 in the Supplemen-
tary Appendix).
At 24 months, the mean laboratory-measured 
fasting plasma glucose level was significantly 
lower in the degludec group than in the glargine 
group (128±56 vs. 136±57 mg per deciliter [7.1±3.1 
vs. 7.5±3.2 mmol per liter]). Laboratory-measured 
fasting plasma glucose levels decreased more in 
the degludec group than in the glargine group 
(–39.9 mg per deciliter vs. –34.9 mg per deciliter 
[–2.2 mmol per liter vs. –1.9 mmol per liter]) after 
24 months (estimated treatment difference, −7.2 
mg per deciliter; 95% CI, –10.3 to –4.1 [–0.4 mmol 
per liter; 95% CI, –0.6 to –0.2]; P<0.001 in post 
hoc analysis) (Fig. 2D).
Cardiovascular Risk Factors
The observed mean change in cardiovascular risk 
factors from baseline to month 24 did not differ 
between treatment groups for the following vari-
ables: weight, body-mass index, blood pressure, 
pulse, estimated glomerular filtration rate, and all 
blood lipid levels (high-density lipoprotein choles-

cholesterol, and triglycerides) (Table S4 in the 
Supplementary Appendix). Changes in the over-
all use of cardiovascular medications during the 
trial were similar in the two groups (Table S3 in 
the Supplementary Appendix).
Safety and Adverse Events
The rate of adverse events was 44.7 events per 100 
patient-years in the degludec group and 50.1 
events per 100 patient-years in the glargine group; 
the corresponding rates of serious adverse events 
were 44.2 events versus 49.6 events per 100 patient-
years (Table 3). The rate of events leading to per-
manent discontinuation of a trial drug was 3.7 
events per 100 patient-years in the degludec group 
and 4.0 events per 100 patient-years in the glargine 
group. The numbers of malignant, benign, and 
unclassifiable neoplasms were similar in the two 
groups (Table 3, and Table S5 in the Supplemen-
tary Appendix). Serious adverse events that oc-
curred in at least 1% of the patients and critical 
symptoms associated with severe hypoglycemic 
episodes (as confirmed by the event-adjudication 
committee) are described in Tables S6, S7, and S8 
in the Supplementary Appendix. There were no con-
firmed fatal events associated with hypoglycemia.

of degludec as compared with glargine was confirmed because the upper limit of the two-sided 95% confidence interval for the hazard 
ratio was less than 1.3. The results were determined by the event-adjudication committee on the basis of Cox proportional-hazards re-
gression analysis in the intention-to-treat population. Data for patients without an event were censored at the time of the last contact 
(telephone or visit). The inset graphs show the same data on expanded y axes.

Efficacy and Safety of Degludec in Type 2 Diabetes
high cardiovascular risk, we found that degludec 
was noninferior to glargine in terms of cardiovas-
cular events and superior with regard to hypogly-
cemia risk, with a lower rate of both severe and 
nocturnal severe hypoglycemia (by 40% and 53%, 
respectively; P<0.001 for both comparisons). These 
results were achieved at equivalent glycemic con-
trol in the two groups. The demonstrated safety 
of degludec with respect to cardiovascular out-
comes was reflected in the individual components 
of the primary composite outcome and was con-
sistent across multiple prespecified subgroups.
Patients with diabetes have a greater risk of 
cardiovascular disease and cardiovascular-relat-
ed death than do persons without diabetes.1 Sev-
eral trials have consequently investigated the ef-
fect of an intensive reduction in glycemic levels on 
the risk of cardiovascular outcomes in patients 
with type 2 diabetes.14-17 The results of these trials 
have been varied, with UKPDS, ADVANCE, and 
VADT showing a neutral effect of reducing gly-
cemic levels on the risk of cardiovascular events, 
whereas ACCORD showed a significantly in-
creased risk of death both from cardiovascular 
causes and from any cause associated with more 
intensive glycemic control.14-17 The focus on cardio-
vascular outcomes related to diabetes treatments 
was intensified when the FDA issued guidance in 
2008 that described the need to establish the car-
diovascular safety of new antihyperglycemic thera-
pies.18 This recommendation led to the conduct of 
numerous cardiovascular outcomes trials involv-
ing patients with diabetes.19 Although the FDA 
guidance did not specifically include various types 
of insulin, the ORIGIN trial, which was designed 
before the issuing of the FDA guidance and spe-
cifically sought to evaluate the cardiovascular 
safety of glargine, showed no significant differ-
ence in cardiovascular outcomes with glargine 
as compared with standard care.4 In the context 
of this complex landscape of cardiovascular out-
comes trials, we found that degludec was not 
associated with a greater risk of cardiovascular 
outcomes than was glargine at the same level of 
glycemic control.
The development of basal insulins with more 
stable pharmacodynamic profiles has allowed pa-
tients to aim safely for fasting glucose levels in 
the normal range by providing a consistent glu-
cose-lowering effect with a half-life of more than 
24 hours and thereby reducing the occurrence of 
hypoglycemia.20 The reduction in severe hypogly-

The new engl and jour nal of medicine
cemia that is reported in our trial and in previous 
trials that have compared degludec with glargine 
probably results from the improved pharmacody-
namic profile of degludec.7-9,21
The incidence and rates of severe hypoglyce-
mia across cardiovascular outcomes trials4,17,22,23 
are difficult to compare owing to differences in 
the definitions that were used and to factors such 
as frailty, diabetes duration, frequency of insulin 
use, treatment regimens, and treatment targets 
at baseline and during the trial. Among all the 
patients in our trial, the incidence of severe hy-
poglycemia (2.90 events per 100 patient-years) and 
rates (4.97 events per 100 patient-years) were 
within the range that was evident in studies in 
which the use of insulin was a prominent compo-
nent of therapy, which had a range of incidences 
from 0.53 to 5.05 events per 100 patient-years 
and a range of rates from 0.70 to 8.25 events per 
100 patient-years.4,17,22,23 Severe hypoglycemia is 
associated with broad negative consequences for 
patients with diabetes.24,25 The number of patients 
who would need to be treated with degludec rather 
than glargine to avert 1 severe hypoglycemic 
event is 40.
Our trial has several strengths, including its 
double-blind design, large enrollment of patients 
at high cardiovascular risk, and high retention 
rate of patients. The primary limitation of the 
trial is its intermediate duration (2 years). Wheth-
er these findings can be extrapolated to longer 
exposure, to patients with a lower risk of cardio-
vascular events, or both is uncertain. Furthermore, 
no adjustments were made for multiplicity in the 
exploratory analysis beyond the prespecified hier-
archical analyses of the cardiovascular outcomes 
Figure 2. Severe Hypoglycemia and Glucose Control.
Shown are the observed cumulative number of events of severe hypoglycemia (Panel A) and nocturnal severe hypoglycemia (Panel B) 
per patient in the degludec group and the glargine group. For severe hypoglycemia, the superiority of degludec over glargine was con-
firmed because the upper limit of the two-sided 95% confidence interval for the estimated rate ratio was below 1.0. Nocturnal severe 
 
hypoglycemia was defined as an episode with an investigator-reported onset between 12:01 a.m. and 5:59 a.m. Also shown are mea-
sures of treatment efficacy, according to the glycated hemoglobin level (Panel C) and the fasting plasma glucose level (Panel D) in the 
two groups, with both comparisons performed in post hoc analyses.

Efficacy and Safety of Degludec in Type 2 Diabetes
and severe hypoglycemia. Overall, the exploratory 
analyses support the results for the primary and 
secondary outcomes. However, it is important to 
emphasize that these analyses are exploratory and 
have not been adjusted for multiple testing.26-28
In conclusion, we found that in patients with 
type 2 diabetes at high risk for cardiovascular 
events, degludec was noninferior to glargine in 
terms of the incidence of cardiovascular events.
