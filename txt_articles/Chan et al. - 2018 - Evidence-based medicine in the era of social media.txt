online interaction

ABSTRACT
The integration of new knowledge into clinical practice continues to lag
behind discovery. The use of Free Open Access Medical education
(FOAM) has disrupted communication between emergency physicians,
making it easy for practicing clinicians to interact with colleagues from
around the world to discuss the latest and highest impact research.
FOAM has the potential to decrease the knowledge translation gap, but
the concerns raised about its growing influence are 1) research that is
translated too quickly may cause harm if its findings are incorrect;
2) there is little editorial oversight of online material; and 3) eminent
online individuals may develop an outsized influence on clinical
practice. We propose that new types of scholars are emerging to
moderate the changing landscape of knowledge translation: 1) critical
clinicians who critically appraise research in the same way that lay
reviewers critique restaurants; 2) translational teachers adept with these
new technologies who will work with researchers to disseminate their
findings effectively; and 3) interactive investigators who engage with
clinicians to ensure that their findings resonate and are applied at the
bedside. The development of these scholars could build on the promise
of evidence-based medicine by enhancing the appraisal and translation
of research in practice.
RÉSUMÉ
Encore aujourd’hui, il s’écoule un certain temps entre les découvertes et
l’intégration des nouvelles connaissances dans la pratique clinique.
L’arrivée du mouvement Free Open Access Meducation (FOAM) a
bouleversé les communications entre les médecins d’urgence, en per-
mettant aux praticiens d’interagir facilement avec des homologues de
partout dans le monde pour discuter des derniers travaux de recherche et
de ceux qui ont la plus forte incidence. Le mouvement FOAM peut
certes combler des lacunes en matière d’application des connaissances,
mais son utilisation soulève des préoccupations quant à son influence
grandissante : 1) l’application trop rapide des résultats de la recherche
peut s’avérer préjudiciable si les constatations sont erronées; 2) la
documentation en ligne échappe en grande partie à la supervision
rédactionnelle; 3) des personnes de renom en ligne peuvent finir par
exercer une influence trop grande en pratique clinique. Aussi les auteurs
de l’article proposent-ils que de nouveaux types d’érudits voient le jour
afin de régler le monde en mutation de l’application des connaissances.
Ainsi, les cliniciens critiques feraient l’évaluation critique de la
recherche à la manière des critiques profanes de restaurants; les
formateurs en application des connaissances, versés dans le domaine
des nouvelles techniques, travailleraient en collaboration avec les
chercheurs à la diffusion efficace des résultats de leurs travaux; et les
chercheurs interactifs s’engageraient dans des échanges avec les clin-
iciens afin de s’assurer que leurs résultats trouvent bel et bien écho dans
la pratique clinique. La formation de ces groupes d’érudits pourrait
prendre appui sur les grands principes, pleins de promesse, de la
médecine factuelle, en permettant d’améliorer l’évaluation des travaux
de recherche et leur application en pratique clinique.
INTRODUCTION
Advocates of evidence-based medicine (EBM) continue
to mourn the sluggish pace of knowledge translation.
The assimilation of research findings into medical
practice often takes decades; estimates of the lag time
between journal submission and use in routine practice
cluster around 17 to 23 years.1 Reducing the time to the
integration of accepted knowledge has been an objec-
tive of many professional organizations and academic
institutions with varying degrees of success.
A recent Canadian Journal of Emergency Medicine
(CJEM) editorial reviewed how the Free Open Access
Medical education (FOAM or #FOAMed) movement is
disrupting communication within emergency medicine.2

 The impact on knowledge translation by social media-
based platforms (such as blogs and podcasts) continues
to grow globally.
In this second editorial, we discuss the promise and
potential pitfalls of social media with regards to the
dissemination and critical appraisal of the medical
literature. If harnessed effectively, we believe that the
FOAM movement has the potential to engage the
medical community in rapid and effective knowledge
translation that will enhance patient care.
Much ado about FOAM: Concerns regarding the quality of
resources and rapid translation of knowledge
FOAM’s low barrier of entry acts as a double-edged
sword: although content producers are able to publish
analyses of recently published literature quickly, they
do not necessarily undergo the editorial oversight
required of traditional publications. Tools for evaluating
the quality of these secondary resources are emerging
(e.g., ALiEM AIR Series3 and AIR Score,4 METRIQ,5
SMi6)
but
may
take
time
to
be
adopted
into
widespread use.
The lack of traditional editorial and peer-review is
one of the primary academic criticisms of most FOAM
resources.7 Some blogs incorporate variants of editorial
supervision
and
prepublication
peer
review
into
their practice to increase their scholarly credibility,8,9
but these practices are far from standard. Even if online
resources
improve
their
pre-publication
processes,
traditional peer review still has many limitations10
and has not been sufficient to safeguard against the
propagation of bad science or even outright fraud.11
Critics voice concerns that trainees are unduly
influenced by producers of online content.12 Learners
may be able to quote blogs and podcasts without
demonstrating
an
understanding
of
the
primary
literature.
Prominent
members
of
the
online
community could develop an outsized influence on
clinical emergency medicine that could be harmful if
and when they are wrong. Post-publication reviews can
spot errors and misinterpretations, but these addenda
are often found in the less-read comments sections or
more ephemeral media (e.g., Twitter). Furthermore,
because FOAM often relies on reanalyses of primary
research and subsequent collateral FOAM insights, it
may be serially misinterpreted en route to the bedside.
Although FOAM resources may decrease the time
to knowledge integration, the criticisms of FOAM
dissemination apply to traditional methods as well.
Opinion
leaders
have
always
had
a
substantive
impact on practice change.13,14 The online community
is far from the first to place its prominent members
on pedestals – the outsized influence of medical
opinion leaders can be traced back to Osler, if not
Hippocrates. Academic instructors are right to insist
that learners should develop a critical understanding
of the literature before they integrate it in their
practice.
Paradoxically, the increased speed of knowledge
translation may raise concerns about new knowledge
entering practice before safety and efficacy can be
established.12 While all innovation starts with early
adopters, speedy adoption may lead to the utilization
of new evidence before debate and further study have
been conducted. A single study may prove to be an
anomaly, with the realization that these results are
spurious only after further studies and higher-order
evidence (e.g., meta-analyses). The effect of faster
knowledge delivery, while likely beneficial, is not
necessarily certain.
The future of evidence-based medicine
Since the push for teaching critical appraisal skills
in the 1990s, most medical school and residency
curricula have an obligatory EBM component.15,16
While teaching the end-user to read critically made
sense, these curricular additions predated the dynamic
and networking powers of the Internet. Traditional
methods of critical appraisal (i.e., individual users
personally appraising every piece of literature) may not
be sufficient or even practical in the digital age due to
the sheer volume of material produced. Fortunately,
although the connectedness resulting from social media
has contributed to the problem, it may also offer
a solution.
Traditionally, the formal critical appraisal of litera-
ture that defined the era of EBM was conducted in
relative isolation. Physicians read through a paper using
a checklist, then decided whether it was applicable to
their practice. Some congregated in small groups or
local journal clubs to examine literature. Yet in this new
age of instantaneous global communication, it makes
little sense to ignore the insights and perspectives from
the easily accessible, worldwide community of practice.
With social media, we can do much more than passively
digest information; online journal clubs and other

 constructivist platforms have emerged, harnessing our
new connectivity to foster discussions between clin-
icians around the world.17 Modern interconnectivity
can move us from simply reading about novel therapies,
treatments, and initiatives to discussing them with the
scientists who developed them and content experts
across the world. This engagement between scientists
and learned audience members will keep the scientific
community vibrant. Critical participation is key to
EBM in the age of knowledge translation facilitated by
social media.
This participatory approach to the evidence not only
encourages a sophisticated level of learning, but also
offers the potential for the co-construction of knowl-
edge between end-user clinicians who take an active,
participatory role and the scientists who are using novel
and engaging methods to effectively disseminate their
key findings in a timely manner.
In addition to requiring traditional critical appraisal
skills, we propose that these innovations have led to the
evolution of several new types of scholars who will impact
the translation of literature (Figure 1).
How to get started
Box 1 provides some introductory primers for readers
who are new to FOAM and social media resources.
Ultimately, we believe that active engagement is the
most important thing to foster in the readers and
writers of CJEM. So, whether you are a clinician who
can help critique and discuss research, a scientist who
can help work and interact with clinicians and the
public, or an educator interested in helping translate
another’s work, the key to increased quality of online
dissemination is for everyone to participate.
Box 2 lists case studies of successes that we have
observed online, which may provide examples for how
they might interact with others online.
LIMITATIONS
These new breeds of scholars will face limitations and
pitfalls. Critical clinicians will need to gain credibility
and visibility in the online community if their reviews
are to have an impact. Translational teachers are at risk
of being biased towards the researchers with whom they
work, potentially decreasing the acceptability of the
resources that they produce. Interactive investigators
are likely to struggle to maintain a high research profile
while remaining accessible and to ensure that their
research is responsive to the feedback of the online
community, given the dramatically different timelines
of social media discussions and research publications.
Finally, the potential for the growth of these new types
of scholars will be stifled if the traditional reward
structures of academic and community medical practice
are unable to adapt to the recognition of their unique
and valuable contributions to scholarship.
As the new roles for social media become defined, there
will be conflict and overlap between the demands of

| Case Studies
Critical Clinicians
Critical Clinicians have been amongst us for a while. For example, the 
Best Evidence for Emergency Medicine (BEEM) group has been 
assisting with knowledge translation by creating continuing medical 
education courses to teach practicing physicians about the most 
relevant literature for over a decade.
Newer examples that started 
in the FOAM community include physicians like Ryan Radecki (EM 
Literature of Note) and Rory Spiegel (EM Nerd), and Ken Milne 
(Skeptics Guide to Emergency Medicine, SGEM) who make use of 
blogs and podcasts to share their critical appraisals of the latest 
literature.
Translational Influencers
Translational Influencers now exists within the online world as well. Dr. 
Ken Milne, a rural emergency physician, publishes 
Guide to Emergency Medicine
HOP (Hot off the Press) series to 
engage directly with scientists to assist in the translation of their 
work.
Similarly, the CanadiEM.org website has frequently published 
infographics disseminating the results of studies published in the 
Canadian Journal of Emergency Medicine.
Engaged Scientists
Engaged Scientists are also becoming increasingly prevalent. Within 
active department that regularly features novel knowledge translation 
and dissemination strategies. Under the leadership of Dr. Hans 
Rosenberg, this group has an active online social media presence on 
various platforms including their blog (http://emottawa.blogspot.ca/), 
Twitter 
(@EmergMedOttawa) 
and 
Facebook 
(https://www.facebook.com/EmergencyMedicineOttawa/). 
Some 
scientists within that group such as the prolific Dr. Ian Stiell 
(@EMO_Daddy) 
regularly 
engage 
with 
colleagues 
via 
these 
avenues.
More recently, major research studies have also begun engaging 
physicians, recruitment centres, and readers via social media 
accounts. The ARISE study team (@ARISEstudy) managed a Twitter 
account dedicated to their multi-centered randomized trial of early goal 
directed therapy versus usual care for patients with severe sepsis. The 
social media account for this study was first established to engage with 
physicians recruiting for the study (see figure 2), and continues to 
engage with other Twitter users and FOAM participants to bridge the 
critical steps of knowledge translation nearly two years after the 
publication of their primary findings.
Via this account, the research team has highlighted lectures and 
panels at conferences, engages with FOAM commentators, clinician 
colleagues, chats with clinicians at the bedside, and regularly tweets 
about related papers (e.g. ProMISe, as depicted in figure 3).

Figure 3 | A tweet from the ARISE study Twitter account on 2014-09-

This 
account 
also 
reaches 
out 
to 
FOAM 
participants 
and 
commentators to arrange podcasts, retweet blogs about their study, 
and engage actively with stakeholders.

The influence of these scholars on emergency medicine research
As the online world continues to play an increasingly large role in 
emergency medicine education, researchers will need to adjust to this 
reality. Critical Clinicians use online platforms with increasingly 
frequency, and emergency medicine researchers should anticipate 
(and hope) that their publications will be discussed and debated on 
public forums. Not all scientists will be comfortable engaging with 
these clinicians or promoting their research. We suggest that they 
invite a Translational Influencer to assist with their work. Collaborations 
with those possessing specialized skills in developing communication 
strategies for audience engagement, for instance, might provide 
scientists with insights on how to increase the reach of their research 
findings. Journals that foster their own translational influencers, as 
CJEM has done with the SGEM HOP podcasts and CanadiEM 
infographics, are more likely to become increasingly attractive places 
to publish for research groups that do not have their own talent in 
these areas.

 expertise in each subfield. New scholars may find that the
demands of knowledge translation and communication
compete with research and clinical practice. There is only
a finite amount of time, effort, and skill. So, a team-based
approach, with multiple collaborators taking on different
roles will likely be the way forward.
CONCLUSION
There will always be a risk in the adoption of any
new finding that subsequent research will demonstrate
unexpected fallibilities. Conversely, the delayed intro-
duction of a new technique or system may cause unne-
cessary patient harm. The emergence of critical clinicians,
translational teachers, and interactive investigators will
not make these dilemmas any less likely; by incorporating
a broader community with new perspectives and diverse
skills, we have suggested a methodology to more safely
reduce the knowledge translation and implementation
gap. Let debates take place in open and public forums,
rather than the isolated circles of individual clinicians or
local groups. Engagement and participation can usher in
a new era of transparency around clinical decision-
making,
knowledge
integration,
and
evidence-based
practice.
