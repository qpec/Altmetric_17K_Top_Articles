 Methods—252 ART-treated HIV-infected participants with dyslipidemia were randomized (1:1) 
to pitavastatin 4mg daily vs. pravastatin 40mg daily in the INTREPID Trial. In this analysis of the 
INTREPID Trial, we assessed markers of immune activation and arterial inflammation using a 
modified intent to treat population. This trial is registered with ClinicalTrials.gov (NCT01301066).
Results—126 participants were randomized to receive pitavastatin and 126 to pravastatin. 99 
participants in the pitavastatin group and 91 participants in the pravastatin group completed the 
study. Median age was 50(45,56) years [median(IQR)]. Baseline, LDL-C was 153(135,171) 
mg/dL, log HIV-1 viral load was 1.1±0.2 copies/mL and CD4 count was 580(439,794) cells/mm3. 
At Week 52, the pitavastatin group had a significantly greater reduction (% change) compared to 
pravastatin in sCD14 (−10.0 vs. 0.6%, P=0.02), oxLDL (−26.9 vs. −17.5%, P=0.02), and Lp-PLA2 
(−26.6 vs. −15.5%, P=0.005) (pitavastatin vs. pravastatin).
Conclusions—52 weeks of pitavastatin 4mg daily (vs. pravastatin 40mg daily) led to a greater 
reduction in select markers of immune activation and arterial inflammation (sCD14, oxLDL and 
LpPLA2) among HIV-infected participants. Further work is needed to assess whether immune-
modulatory effects of pitavastatin reduce CVD risk in HIV.

Introduction
Cardiovascular disease (CVD) risk is increased among HIV-infected individuals, including 
those with viral suppression on anti-retroviral therapy (ART).[1] Atherosclerosis, in 
particular, is a highly inflammatory process that is characterized by endothelial cell 
dysfunction, cytokine production, and the recruitment of monocytes to the intima of arteries. 
Among HIV-infected subjects on ART, arterial inflammation has been found to be increased 
compared to non-HIV-infected controls and the mechanisms underlying this difference 
remain to be elucidated.[2] Persistent immune activation, even after effective ART, has been 
postulated as a possible contributor.[3, 4] Development of successful strategies to reduce 
immune activation and arterial inflammation is a critical goal to reduce potential co-
morbidities in HIV. However, relatively little is known regarding effective treatment 
strategies for residual immune activation among individuals living with HIV on ART.
Statins have been studied as a possible therapy to reduce CVD risk and immune activation in 
HIV-infected subjects on ART and have been shown to affect several indices of immune 
activation such as the proportion of activated T-cells and tissue factor positive patrolling 
monocytes.[5–9] Data are currently lacking for the effects of newer statins, such as 
pitavastatin, which have been found to have less drug-drug interactions with ART compared 
to older statins,[10] because of primary metabolism via glucuronidation as opposed to the 
cytochrome P450 system. Animal and in vitro data suggest potent effects of pitavastatin on 
inflammatory indices[11–13] but such effects have not been previously assessed in the HIV 
population. Currently, among individuals living with HIV, pravastatin is a recommended 
statin drug. As such we compared effects of pitavastatin to this commonly used statin on 
markers of arterial inflammation and immune activation in a large double-blind, active-

 controlled, parallel-group study in which pitavastatin 4mg had a greater effect in reducing 
low density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C) after 52 weeks of statin therapy compared to 
pravastatin 40mg in HIV-infected participants.[14] In addition, the INTREPID study has 
shown that pitavastatin does not aggravate glucose parameters, an important consideration in 
choice of statins among HIV-infected patients.[15] We hypothesized that pitavastatin, at the 
recommended daily dose of 4mg, would have a greater effect in reducing key indices of 
arterial inflammation and immune activation, related to CVD in HIV, compared with 
pravastatin 40mg daily. No prior study has evaluated the effects of pitavastatin on immune 
indices and markers of arterial inflammation in HIV-infected patients.
Methods
Study design and participants
HIV-infected patieNts and TREatment with PItavastatin vs. pravastatin for Dyslipidemia 
(INTREPID) was a randomized, double-blind, double-dummy, active-controlled, parallel-
group, superiority trial conducted at 45 sites in the United States and Puerto Rico. The study 
was performed from February 23, 2011 to March 29, 2013. The primary aim of the study 
was to compare the effect of pitavastatin 4mg vs. pravastatin 40mg on LDL-C reduction in 
individuals with HIV and dyslipidemia over 12 weeks, followed by a 40-week safety 
extension period and was approved by the Institutional Review Board at each participating 
center. Reporting of the primary results also included safety data. All participants provided 
written informed consent prior to enrollment. Males or females who were 18 to 70 years of 
age at the time of consent, had documented HIV infection, were receiving ART (except 
darunavir) for 6 months or greater, and had HIV-1 RNA <200 copies/mL and a CD4 count of 
>200 cells/mm3 for greater than 3 months were eligible. Statin-naïve participants and 
participants receiving statins at the initial screen, after a minimum 4-week washout period, 
were eligible for study participation. Participants were excluded for the following: 
conditions causing secondary dyslipidemia, history of coronary heart disease (CAD) or a 
CAD equivalent, active systemic infections, or prior or current muscular or neuromuscular 
disease of any type.
After the initial screening, all eligible participants underwent a 4-week dietary stabilization 
period, based on the Therapeutic Lifestyle Changes (TLC) diet[16], and were counseled on 
the TLC diet after the initial screen and for the remainder of the study period. After the 
wash-out and diet stabilization period, lipid eligibility was determined by a LDL-C value 
≥130 mg/dL and ≤220 mg/dL and triglyceride (TG) value ≤400 mg/dL. Participants who 
met all eligibility criteria were then randomized 1:1 to receive active pitavastatin 4mg orally 
once daily and a matching pravastatin placebo versus active pravastatin 40mg orally once 
daily and a matching pitavastatin placebo for 52 weeks.
The study protocol called for exploratory analyses of future biomarkers. The present work 
represents an investigator-initiated biomarker analysis, conducted independently of the 
primary study, with specific markers chosen based on emerging research trends in the field 
related to an increasing appreciation of the role played by immune activation and arterial 
inflammation in the pathogenesis of CVD in HIV patients on ART, and the potential 
importance of statins to modulate these effects. In this context, percent change in oxidized

 LDL (oxLDL) as well as soluble CD163 (sCD163), high-sensitivity IL-6 (hsIL-6), monocyte 
chemoattractant protein-1 (MCP-1), soluble CD14 (sCD14), and lipoprotein-associated 
phospholipase 2 (Lp-PLA2) were assessed and changes from Baseline to Week 12 and Week 
52 are reported.
Randomization and masking
Eligible participants were randomly assigned (1:1) using a central interactive voice response 
system. The randomization schedule was prepared by the biostatistics department of the 
contract research organization performing the trial. Treatment codes were not available to 
study investigators, site staff, or participants, and each participant received a matching 
placebo.
Procedures
Participants were seen every 4 weeks for the first 12 weeks of the study, with subsequent 
visits occurring quarterly through Week 52. EDTA plasma samples for markers of systemic 
immune activation and arterial inflammation were obtained at Baseline, Week 12, and Week 
52 and were stored at −80°C. The specific numbers of specimens available for each analysis 
are listed in the data tables.
Measurements of the creatinine, thyroid stimulating hormone (TSH), lipid panel, CD4 count, 
and HIV-1 RNA were performed using standard techniques. Plasma sCD163 levels were 
quantified by ELISA according to manufacturer’s protocol (Trillium Diagnostics LLC, 
Bangor, ME). Plasma levels of hsIL-6, sCD14, MCP-1, and Lp-PLA2 were quantified by 
ELISA according to manufacturer’s protocol (R&D Systems, Minneapolis, MN). Plasma 
oxLDL levels were quantified by ELISA according to manufacturer’s protocol (Mercodia, 
Inc.) All ELISAs were performed in duplicate with appropriate quality control samples.
Statistical Analysis
The primary objective of INTREPID was to compare the between-group difference in the 
percent change in fasting serum LDL-C at Week 12 between the pitavastatin and pravastatin 
groups. In this current analysis, changes from Baseline to Week 12 and Baseline to Week 52 
in oxLDL sCD163, hsIL-6, MCP-1, sCD14, and Lp-PLA2 are reported. Objectives of this 
current study included a comparison of the between-group absolute difference in these 
markers from Baseline to Week 12 and from Baseline to Week 52 and the within-group 
absolute difference in these markers from Baseline to Week 12 and from Baseline to Week 
52. All available data within a modified intent-to-treat population (mITT) using a last 
observation carried forward method were included in the primary analyses. The mITT 
population included all randomized participants who had at least one post-baseline visit with 
blood samples available for the assessment of biomarkers. For those terminating prior to 
Week 12, the last post-baseline observation was carried forward to the Week 12 endpoint. 
Similarly, for those terminating after Week 12 but prior to Week 52, the last post-baseline 
observation was carried forward to the Week 52 endpoint. Sensitivity analyses using a per-
protocol population (PPP) were performed and results shown in the Supplement. For the 
Week 12 endpoint, the PPP consisted of participants who had Baseline and Week 12 
samples. For the Week 52 endpoint, the PPP consisted of participants who had Baseline and

 Week 52 samples. The study was powered for the primary endpoint of change in LDL. For 
the current analysis, with available data on change in biomarkers in 230 patients in the mITT 
analysis, the study had 90% power to detect a 0.43 SD difference between the groups.
Normality of the data was assessed using a Shapiro-Wilk test and normally distributed data 
are presented as mean ±SD and non-normally distributed data are presented by the median 
and interquartile range (IQR). The biomarkers were all non-normally distributed except for 
Lp-PLA2 and are all presented as median and IQR. Baseline comparisons between the 
pravastatin group and the pitavastatin group were made using the student’s t-test for 
normally distributed continuous variables, Wilcoxon rank sum test for non-normally 
distributed continuous variables, and χ2 test for categorical variables. Comparisons of the 
change in biomarkers over 12 weeks and 52 weeks between groups were assessed using the 
Wilcoxon rank sum test. To assess changes in the biomarkers over 12 weeks and 52 weeks 
within a group, a Wilcoxon signed rank test was used. Bivariate analyses between 
continuous variables were performed using a Spearman’s rank correlation coefficient if at 
least one variable was non-normally distributed. Sensitivity analyses comparing baseline 
levels of biomarkers, in a combined analysis of both statin groups, between males and 
females and the overall change in biomarkers at Week 52 stratified by statin group and sex 
were performed using the Wilcoxon rank sum test. Statistical analyses were performed using 
SAS JMP software (version 11.0; SAS Institute). The trial is registered on ClinicalTrials.gov 
(NCT01301066).
Results
Between February 23, 2011 to March 29, 2013, 594 participants were screened (Figure 1). 
Of these, a total of 342 were deemed ineligible, including 190 not meeting inclusion based 
on an LDL-C value ≥ 130 mg/dL and ≤ 220 mg/dL and triglyceride (TG) value ≤400 mg/dL. 
A total of 252 participants were randomly assigned to receive pitavastatin (126 participants) 
or pravastatin (126 participants). In the present analyses, all study participants with available 
blood samples for biomarkers at Baseline and at least one blood sample after the Baseline 
visit assessed for biomarkers were included (n=230; Figure 1).
Baseline Demographics
Overall, the median age for the study participants was 50(45, 56) years. Eighty-seven 
percent were male and 26% were Hispanic or Latino. The baseline LDL-C was 153(135, 
171) mg/dL. The median Framingham Risk Score was 5(3, 9)%. With respect to HIV-
specific parameters, baseline log HIV-1 viral load was 1.1±0.2 copies, and the CD4 count 
was 580(439, 794) cell/mm3 (Table 1; mITT population). Differences in baseline 
parameters, including immune activation markers were not seen other than for a small 
difference in CD4 count between groups. Baseline demographics for participants who did 
not have available blood samples for assessment of markers of immune activation and 
arterial inflammation (n=22) were not included in this analysis and were not significantly 
different from the demographics of those included (data not shown).

 Changes in Markers of Immune Activation and Arterial Inflammation
At Week 12, the pitavastatin group had a significantly greater reduction (% change) 
compared to pravastatin in oxLDL (−25.5 vs. −18.6%, P=0.001) and Lp-PLA2 (−23.4 vs. 
−17.4%, P=0.02, [pitavastatin vs. pravastatin]) (Table 2A). For absolute changes see Table 
2A.
At Week 52, the pitavastatin group had a significantly greater reduction (% change) 
compared to pravastatin in sCD14 (−10.0 vs. 0.6%, P=0.02), oxLDL (−26.9 vs. −17.5%, 
P=0.02), and Lp-PLA2 (−26.6 vs. −15.5%, P=0.005) (pitavastatin vs. pravastatin) (Table 2B; 
Figure 2). Within the pitavastatin group, the absolute changes in immune activation and 
inflammatory indices were significant for sCD14 [−156.4 (−501.6, 114.5)ng/ml (P=0.003)], 
oxLDL [−20.5(−33.4, −8.8)U/L (P<0.0001)], and Lp-PLA2 [−44.3 (−77.8, −10.7)ng/mL 
(P<0.0001). Within the pravastatin group, the absolute changes were significant for oxLDL 
[−13.2 (−25.2, −4.1)U/L (P<0.0001)] and Lp-PLA2 [−26.7 (−52.0, −5.0)ng/ml (P<0.0001)] 
(Table 2B).
Changes in sCD14, oxLDL and Lp-PLA2 were compared at Week 52, and there was a high 
degree of correlation between change over 52 weeks in oxLDL and Lp-PLA2 (ρ=0.45, 
P<0.0001). The change in LDL-C at Week 52 was also strongly correlated with the changes 
in oxLDL (ρ=0.59, P<0.0001) and Lp-PLA2 at 52 weeks (ρ=0.64, P<0.0001) whereas the 
change in sCD14 was independent of the changes in LDL-C (ρ=0.04, P=0.63). The 
correlations between the change in LDL-C at Week 52 and the changes in sCD14, oxLDL 
and Lp-PLA2 were qualitatively similar between the pitavastatin and pravastatin group 
(Supplemental Table 1).
Predictive Markers of Change in Immune Activation and Arterial Inflammation in Response 
to Statins
Neither CD4 count nor viral load predicted change in sCD14, oxLDL or Lp-PLA2 at Week 
52 (Table 3). Similarly, traditional risk markers including Framingham Risk Score and age 
did not predict changes in these markers. In contrast, baseline LDL-C was a significant 
predictor of changes in oxLDL (ρ=−0.17, P=0.02) and an even stronger predictor of change 
in Lp-PLA2 (ρ=−0.27, P=0.0002). In addition, baseline levels of each immune activation 
marker were significant and strong predictors of change in each marker, respectively (Table 
3).
Stratification by Sex
For those variables that differed significantly between pitavastatin and pravastatin at Week 
52, the changes among women were generally similar to those seen among men for oxLDL 
and Lp-PLA2 but qualitatively greater among women for sCD14 (−24.3 vs. 17.8% 
[pitavastatin vs. pravastatin, females], −6.0 vs. −2.0% [pitavastatin vs. pravastatin, males]) 
(Supplemental Table 2).
Sensitivity Analyses within the Per Protocol Population
Baseline demographics for the PPP are shown in Supplemental Table 3. Within the PPP, the 
pitavastatin group had a significantly greater reduction (% change) compared to the

 pravastatin group in oxLDL and Lp-PLA2 at Week 12 (Supplemental Table 4) and a 
significantly greater reduction (% change) in sCD14, oxLDL, and Lp-PLA2 at Week 52 
(Supplemental Table 5). Similar to the mITT population, baseline LDL-C was a predictor of 
changes in oxLDL (ρ=˗0.17, P=0.03) and Lp-PLA2 (ρ=˗0.26, P=0.0007) (Supplemental 
Table 6). Changes in LDL-C at Week 52 strongly correlated with changes in oxLDL 
(ρ=0.58, P<0.0001) and changes in Lp-PLA2 at Week 52 (ρ=0.65, P<0.0001); and there was 
also a high degree of correlation between change over 52 weeks in oxLDL and Lp-PLA2 
(ρ=0.44, P<0.0001). The correlations between the change in LDL-C at Week 52 and the 
changes in sCD14, oxLDL and Lp-PLA2 were qualitatively similar between the pitavastatin 
and pravastatin group as was seen in the mITT population (Supplemental Table 7). 
Sensitivity analyses by sex within the PPP revealed similar results to those of the mITT 
population (Supplemental Table 8).
Discussion
This study is the first and largest, prospective, active-controlled randomized trial evaluating 
the effect of two different statins on markers of systemic immune activation and arterial 
inflammation in HIV-infected subjects. The two statins compared in this study – pitavastatin 
and pravastatin – have in common a favorable pharmacokinetic (PK) profile when used 
together with ART, though there is a clinically significant interaction between pravastatin 
and darunavir that is not seen with pitavastatin.[17] We find that pitavastatin (vs. pravastatin) 
results in a greater percent and absolute reduction in sCD14, oxLDL, and LpPLA-2. 
Additionally, within each treatment group, levels of sCD14, oxLDL, and Lp-PLA2 were 
significantly reduced by Week 52 in the pitavastatin group while only oxLDL and Lp-PLA2 
were significantly reduced by Week 52 in the pravastatin group.
Unlike other statins, such as atorvastatin and simvastatin, which are metabolized by the 
CYP450 3A4 iso-enzyme, pitavastatin is predominately metabolized by glucuronidation and 
only minimally by CYP450, marginally by CYP2C9 and to a lesser extent by CYP2C8 and 
has minimal interactions with anti-retroviral medications. In contrast, the known interaction 
between pravastatin and darunavir necessitated exclusion of patients receiving darunavir 
from the study.[17] Given the significant need to identify treatment strategies to reduce CVD 
risk in HIV-infected subjects on ART, it is highly desirable to identify statins such as 
pitavastatin that, not only demonstrate strong immune-modulatory effects, but also have a 
favorable PK profile when used together with ART.
In the current study, pitavastatin, but not pravastatin, led to a significant, reduction of 10% in 
levels of sCD14 at Week 52. Soluble CD14 has been found to be elevated in HIV-infected 
subjects as compared to non-HIV-infected subjects and has been found to be a predictor of 
mortality and progression of subclinical atherosclerosis in HIV-infected subjects. [4, 15, 18] 
In the SATURN-HIV study, a placebo-controlled study of rosuvastatin 10 mg/day, 
rosuvastatin similarly reduced sCD14 by approximately 10% at 48 weeks.[5] This reduction 
in monocyte activation, in light of the central role of monocytes and macrophages in 
atherogenesis, provides a possible mechanism by which statins could modulate CVD risk in 
the HIV population in addition to its lipid lowering effects.

 In this study, pitavastatin also led to a greater reduction in oxLDL compared to pravastatin. 
Oxidized LDL is a pro-inflammatory form of LDL-C that has been found to be elevated in 
HIV-infected subjects compared to controls.[19] Notably, uptake of oxLDL by macrophages 
in the arterial wall is thought to contribute to foam cell generation; and oxLDL has also been 
shown to induce inflammatory changes in vascular smooth muscle cells and induce 
apoptosis of macrophages.[20, 21] Thus, the reduction of oxLDL in our study population 
provides another possible mechanism whereby statins could modulate CVD risk in the HIV-
infected population. The percent reduction in oxLDL with pitavastatin in this current study 
was higher compared to that seen in a recent study by Nou et al., which reported a median 
reduction of oxLDL of −14.9% with atorvastatin in HIV-infected subjects over a 12 month 
period compared to a median reduction of −26.9% over 52 weeks in this analysis. Their 
study also found significant associations between changes in oxLDL and changes in non-
calcified plaque, total plaque volume, positively remodeled plaque, and low attenuation 
plaque.[21] In SATURN-HIV, oxLDL was significantly reduced with rosuvastatin compared 
to placebo; and changes in oxLDL were associated with changes in sCD14 and changes in 
the percentage CD14dimCD16+ monocytes.[22] Together, these studies point to the possible 
effect of statins, through the reduction of oxLDL, to modulate the inflammation that 
characterizes accelerated atherosclerotic plaque formation and progression in HIV-infected 
subjects.
Pitavastatin as compared to pravastatin also led to a greater reduction in Lp-PLA2. Lp-PLA2 
is a calcium-independent lipase that catalyzes a reaction on the surface of LDL that leads to 
the release of lysophosphatidylcholine, which has pro-oxidative effects, and oxidized fatty 
acids, which have pro-inflammatory effects. [23] HIV-infected subjects have also been 
shown to have abnormally elevated Lp-PLA2, a biomarker that has been associated with 
increased cardiovascular disease in both the general population and HIV-infected population.
[24, 25] Statins have been found to decrease Lp-PLA2 in both HIV and non-HIV-infected 
subjects.[26] [27] [28] In this study, we demonstrate a larger percent reduction in Lp-PLA2 
than was seen with rosuvastatin 10mg daily in SATURN-HIV.[26] Given both the pro-
inflammatory and pro-oxidative effects of Lp-PLA2, it is plausible that the reduction of Lp-
PLA2 with statin therapy could lead to a decrease in cardiovascular events among HIV-
infected individuals.
We performed association analyses which suggested that higher levels of immune activation 
markers strongly predicted changes with statin therapy, suggesting a greater effect of statins 
among those with the highest degree of immune activation. In contrast, baseline immune 
function and HIV-1 viral load were not predictors of change over time with statin therapy. 
Baseline demographics did not predict change over time, but interestingly baseline LDL-C 
was a highly significant predictor of change in Lp-PLA2, suggesting a connection between 
dyslipidemia and arterial inflammation that may be statin amenable. In addition, changes in 
oxLDL and Lp-PLA2 were highly associated, suggesting a putative role for oxLDL in the 
promotion of arterial inflammation among HIV patients.
Similar to other studies evaluating the effects of statins (such as rosuvastatin [6, 26] and 
atorvastatin [21]) on immune activation in HIV-infected individuals, there was no significant 
change in the levels of sCD163 or hsIL-6 with either pitavastatin or pravastatin in our study.

 Levels of both sCD163 and IL-6 have been associated with atherosclerotic plaque in HIV-
infected[3, 29] and non-HIV-infected subjects[30] and more recently with overall mortality 
in HIV-infected subjects[29, 31]. While the underlying mechanism of these effects remains 
unclear, the lack of a significant change in these biomarkers in our study, as in other statin 
studies, could relate to effects of the virus on specific immune pathways which are not 
modifiable by statins. Further research is needed to understand the clinical implications and 
mechanisms of the observed statin effects on immune function in this study.
Limitations of this study include the lack of data evaluating whether or not the changes seen 
in markers of immune activation and arterial inflammation related to changes in 
atherosclerotic plaque and/or cardiovascular events. Additionally, our study population 
included a specific group of HIV-infected participants with baseline dyslipidemia, i.e. LDL-
C ≥130mg/dL to ≤220mg/dL; but our data on immune activation and arterial inflammation 
remain highly relevant, and we further explore relationships to change in LDL, not 
previously performed. The study was not specifically powered to assess changes in 
biomarkers, but was sufficiently large to detect clinically significant differences between the 
treatment groups. Strengths of this study include the randomization of two statins with 
favorable PK profiles in the context of ART and the relatively large sample size compared to 
other studies evaluating the effect of statins on these biomarkers. Importantly, participants 
were assessed early but also up to one year after initiation of therapy, permitting an 
investigation of the durability of the responses observed. Results were robust and similar in 
the mITT population and the per protocol population.
In conclusion, this large study is the first prospective, active-controlled, randomized trial to 
compare the effects of two statins, which are known to have minimal drug-drug interactions 
with ART, on markers of immune activation and arterial inflammation. This study provides 
novel data demonstrating that this new statin, pitavastatin, leads to a greater reduction than 
pravastatin in sCD14, oxLDL, and Lp-PLA2; and this effect is durable over 52 weeks. 
Analysis of data from this cohort additionally demonstrates that pitavastatin has a superior 
LDL lowering effect than pravastatin and that pitavastatin has net neutral effects on 
parameters of glucose homeostasis and insulin resistance.[15] This is important as other 
statins in HIV, such as rosuvastatin, have been shown to increase glucose and worsen insulin 
resistance.[32] Therefore, pitavastatin, through the reduction of indices of immune 
activation, its lipid-lowering effects, and its favorable PK profile when used in combination 
with ART, may be an effective treatment strategy in chronically treated HIV-infected 
subjects. Studies are now needed to evaluate whether the reduction of cardiovascular 
biomarkers by statins in HIV will translate into a reduction in the morbidity and mortality of 
the HIV-infected population. The effects of pitavastatin 4mg on primary prevention of CVD 
events among HIV-infected subjects are currently being assessed in the REPRIEVE trial, a 
large multicenter randomized trial to prevent vascular events in HIV-infected subjects.

infected with Hepatitis B or C were required to have ALT and AST ≤1.5 ULN, fasting serum 
glucose ≤125 mg/dL, CK ≤ × ULN. If a transient increase in CK level was suspected due to 
exercise or trauma, CK may have been repeated at screening after an “exercise washout” at 
the discretion of the Investigator, serum creatinine ≤1.3 × ULN and estimated glomerular 
filtration rate (eGFR) ≥60 mL/min/1.73m2 based on the modification of diet in renal disease
