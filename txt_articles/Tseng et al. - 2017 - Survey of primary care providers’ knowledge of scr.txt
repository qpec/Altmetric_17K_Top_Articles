BACKGROUND: Prediabetes affects 86 million US adults,
but primary care providers’ (PCPs') knowledge, practices,
attitudes and beliefs toward prediabetes are unclear.
OBJECTIVE: Assess PCPs’ (1) knowledge of risk factors
that should prompt prediabetes screening, laboratory
criteria for diagnosing prediabetes and guidelines for
management of prediabetes; (2) management practices
around prediabetes; (3) attitudes and beliefs about
prediabetes.
DESIGN: Self-administered written survey of PCPs.
PARTICIPANTS: One hundred forty of 155 PCPs (90%)
attending an annual provider retreat for academically af-
filiated multispecialty practices in the mid-Atlantic
region.
MAIN MEASURES: Descriptive analyses of survey ques-
tions on knowledge, management, and attitudes and be-
liefs related to prediabetes. Multivariate logistic regres-
sion was used to determine the association between pro-
vider characteristics (gender, race/ethnicity, years since
training, specialty and provider type) and knowledge,
management, and attitudes and beliefs about
prediabetes.
KEY RESULTS: Six percent of PCPs correctly identified all
of the risk factors that should prompt prediabetes screen-
ing. Only 17% of PCPs correctly identified the laboratory
parameters for diagnosing prediabetes based on both
fasting glucose and hemoglobin A1c. Nearly 90% of PCPs
reported close follow-up (within 6 months) of patients with
prediabetes. Few PCPs (11%) selected referral to a behav-
ioral weight loss program as the recommended initial
management approach to prediabetes. PCPs agreed that
patient-related factors are important barriers to lifestyle
change and metformin use. Provider characteristics were
generally not associated with knowledge, management,
attitudes and beliefs about prediabetes in multivariate
analyses.
CONCLUSIONS: Addressing gaps in knowledge and the
underutilization of behavioral weight loss programs in
prediabetes are two essential areas where PCPs could
take a lead in curbing the diabetes epidemic.

INTRODUCTION
Eighty-six million US adults have prediabetes, a major public
health issue that the Centers for Disease Control (CDC) has
addressed through a screening campaign for prediabetes.1, 2
Diagnosing prediabetes is important for diabetes prevention
since an estimated 70% of individuals with prediabetes will
eventually develop diabetes.3 Prediabetes is diagnosed based
on laboratory tests: fasting glucose, 100-125 mg/dl; hemoglo-
bin A1c, 5.7–6.4%; or 2-h post-stimulation glucose, 140–
199 mg/dl.4 Prediabetes is associated with premature mortal-
ity5, 6 and increased risk of autonomic neuropathy and idio-
pathic polyneuropathy.3 Behavioral lifestyle interventions are
effective in preventing the development of diabetes.7, 8 In the
Diabetes Prevention Program (DPP) clinical trial, there was a
reduction in diabetes incidence of 27% with lifestyle interven-
tion and 18% with metformin compared to placebo over a
mean follow-up of 15 years.9 Based on the DPP, the American
Diabetes Association (ADA) recommends an intensive diet
and physical activity behavioral counseling program for all
patients with prediabetes and suggests that metformin be
considered in patients with additional risk factors (BMI
≥35 kg/m2, age <60, history of gestational diabetes or rising
hemoglobin A1c despite lifestyle intervention).10 The Afford-
able Care Act authorized the establishment of the CDC Na-
tional Diabetes Prevention Program (NDPP), a lifestyle
change program, which targets 5–7% body weight loss and
150 min per week of moderate intensity physical activity.11
Despite the success of preventive interventions, evidence
suggests that 90% of individuals with prediabetes are unaware
of their diagnosis.11 Furthermore, most patients with predia-
betes are not receiving the evidence-based recommendations
from their providers for prevention, especially specific

 counseling and referral for lifestyle modification.12–15 To our
knowledge, there is no prior literature on why prediabetes is
not being diagnosed by providers; therefore, we sought to
understand the factors involved by surveying providers.
Understanding primary care providers’ (PCPs') knowledge
about screening and diagnosing prediabetes is important for
informing and improving screening and referral rates to effec-
tive interventions. To improve the care of patients with predi-
abetes, we must also understand how PCPs are managing these
patients and what the perceived barriers are in treating these
patients. We conducted a survey among PCPs to assess (1)
knowledge of risk factors that should prompt prediabetes
screening, laboratory criteria for diagnosing prediabetes, and
guidelines on recommended therapy for prediabetes; (2) man-
agement practices for prediabetes; and (3) attitude and beliefs
regarding prediabetes and its management (lifestyle modifica-
tion and metformin). We evaluated provider characteristics
associated with these domains to understand potential determi-
nants of knowledge, current practices, and attitudes and beliefs.
METHODS
Setting and survey design
We surveyed PCPs from multispecialty practices affiliated
with one academic system that served over 244,000 patients
in 2015 at 40 practice sites across the mid-Atlantic region.
These practices employ a total of 166 PCPs, including physi-
cians, nurse practitioners and physician assistants. The patient
population is diverse: patients are 28% African American, 5%
Asian and 5% Hispanic. Insurance coverage varies (62%
commercial, 15% Tricare/other government programs, 11%
Medicaid, 9% Medicare). At the time of survey administra-
tion, these practices did not have behavioral weight loss pro-
grams available (i.e., DPP).
The survey domains were designed based on clinical expe-
rience, existing literature and input from practice leaders. We
conducted a pretest of the written survey among a small group
of primary care providers (n = 15) and refined the instrument
to enhance the clarity and interpretability of the questions. We
distributed the survey to PCPs from the practices at their
annual provider retreat in 2015. The 156 adult PCPs who
attended the meeting were invited to participate in the survey
on-site. Participants received a $10 gift card.
Survey instrument
We designed the survey to evaluate: (1) knowledge of risk
factors that should prompt prediabetes screening, laboratory
criteria for diagnosing prediabetes and guidelines on recom-
mended therapy for prediabetes; (2) management practices
around prediabetes; and (3) attitude and beliefs regarding predi-
abetes and its management (see Online). The ADA and Amer-
ican Association of Clinical Endocrinologists (AACE) have
screening and management guidelines for prediabetes, whereas
the US Preventive Services Task Force (USPSTF) has only
screening guidelines, and the American College of Physicians
(ACP) has neither.10, 16 We used the ADA guidelines for this
survey because the AACE guidelines target endocrinologists.
Risk factors for prediabetes screening. Providers were given
a list of potential risk factors and asked to select which ones
might prompt them to screen for prediabetes. These risk
factors are defined by the ADA as ones to consider for
prediabetes screening among adults who are overweight.4
Providers were also asked to select which guidelines they
use for prediabetes screening.
Laboratory criteria for diagnosing prediabetes. Providers
were asked to circle the numerical values corresponding to
the upper and lower limits of the laboratory criteria for
diagnosing prediabetes based on fasting glucose (answer
range 70–160 mg/dl in 2 mg/dl increments) and HbA1c
(answer range 5–7% in 0.1% increments).
Guideline recommendations for treatment of prediabetes.
Providers were asked to circle the values corresponding to
the ADA recommendations for minimum weight loss (% of
body weight) and minimum physical activity (minutes per
week) for patients with prediabetes. Providers were also
asked to identify the Bbest (recommended) initial management
approach^ to a patient with prediabetes (Online).
Management practices for prediabetes. Providers were asked
about their use of prediabetes screening tests (non-fasting
glucose, fasting glucose, 2-h oral glucose tolerance test and/or
HbA1c), initial management approach (including metformin
use), and intervals for repeat laboratory work and follow-up
visits. Finally, we assessed whether the ADA guidelines for
prediabetes have been helpful for managing patients with
prediabetes.
Attitudes and beliefs about prediabetes and management of
prediabetes. To evaluate attitudes and beliefs regarding
prediabetes, we used a 5-point Likert scale (strongly agree to
strongly disagree) to assess whether providers believe it is
important to identify prediabetes and whether they believe
that lifestyle modification and metformin can reduce the risk
of progression to diabetes.
Additionally, we used a similar 5-point Likert scale to evaluate
what providers perceive as patient barriers to lifestyle modifica-
tion and metformin use (Table 2). As follow-up to the above
questions, we presented several possible interventions for im-
proving the management and treatment of prediabetes and asked
providers whether they agreed that these would be helpful
(Table 2).
Provider characteristics. We asked about provider training
(internal medicine, internal medicine-pediatrics or family
medicine), provider type (physician, nurse practitioner or
1173

JGIM
 physician assistant), number of years since completing resi-
dency or clinical training, gender and race/ethnicity.
Statistical analysis
Survey data were entered and managed using Microsoft Access
(2013). We conducted descriptive analyses to quantify responses
to survey questions related to the outcomes (knowledge, man-
agement practices, and attitudes and beliefs related to prediabe-
tes). We used multivariate logistic regression to determine the
association between provider characteristics and these outcomes.
In the multivariate model, provider characteristics (gender, race,
number of years since training completed, specialty and provider
type) were added simultaneously with a separate model for each
outcome. For questions with a Likert scale, we dichotomized the
answers by combining agree and strongly agree vs. neutral,
disagree and strongly disagree. We estimated the adjusted per-
centage for each model using the margins command in STATA.
Analyses were conducted using STATA 13.0 (College Station,
TX). This study was exempted by the Johns Hopkins University
School of Medicine Institutional Review Board.
RESULTS
Of 156 adult PCP attendees, 140 (90% of attendees) complet-
ed the survey (84% of all PCPs in the practice). The majority
of respondents were physicians (93%) who were trained in
internal medicine (43%), family medicine (40%) or internal
medicine-pediatrics (15%) (Table 1). Providers were mostly
female (72%), white (55%), Asian (23%) or African American
(14%) and had been in practice for at least 10 years (59%).
Based on internal data from practice leaders, survey respon-
dents (n = 140) were comparable to the 166 providers of the
practice within the selected specialties in gender and specialty.
However, survey respondents were more likely to self-report
Asian ethnicity (23% vs. 10%).
Risk factors for prediabetes screening
On average, providers selected 8 out of the 11 correct
risk factors for prediabetes screening (Online Fig.).
Thirty-nine percent of providers identified all of the
traditional or Bmedical^ risk factors (age ≥45, BMI
≥25 kg/m2, hypertension, dyslipidemia, heart disease,
family history of diabetes, sedentary lifestyle, history of
gestational diabetes). Six percent of providers correctly
identified all 11 of the risk factors for prediabetes screen-
ing (Online Fig.). The most commonly identified risk
factors were family history of diabetes (94%), overweight
(89%), history of gestational diabetes (87%), dyslipid-
emia (86%), hypertension (77%) and history of heart
disease (75%). The least-commonly identified risk factors
were Hispanic ethnicity (52%) and Asian race (38%).
Asian providers were more likely to correctly identify
Asian race as a risk factor compared to white providers
(adjusted percentage, 66% vs. 31%, p = 0.008).
Nearly 20% of providers did not favor any specific guide-
line for prediabetes screening. The remainder reported using
the ADA (63%), USPSTF (30%) and AACE (5%) guidelines.
Laboratory criteria for diagnosing prediabetes
Only 17% of providers correctly identified the laboratory
parameters for diagnosing prediabetes based on both fasting
glucose and HbA1c. We found a range in the distribution of
answers selected (Fig. 1). In the multivariate model, family
medicine and medicine-pediatrics providers picked the correct
HbA1c criteria for prediabetes more often than internal med-
icine providers (adjusted percentage, 20%, 43% and 12%,
respectively, p = 0.02) (Online Table 1).

 patients with prediabetes (ADA guidelines recommend 7% of
body weight and the CDC NDPP recommends 5–7%).10, 11
Nearly 30% answered BDo not know.^ Fewer than half of
providers (45%) chose 150 min per week as the recommended
minimum amount of physical activity. When asked to identify
the Bbest (recommended) initial management approach^ to a
patient with prediabetes, the majority (96%) selected counsel-
ing on diet and physical activity, and only 11% selected
referral to a behavioral weight loss program (Table 2). We
did not find a significant association between provider char-
acteristics and knowledge of guideline recommendations for
the treatment of prediabetes (Online Tables 2 and 3).
Management practices for prediabetes
Providers most commonly use fasting blood glucose (90%)
and HbA1c (89%) for prediabetes screening. When consider-
ing their current clinic resources, providers identified counsel-
ing on diet and physical activity (99%) as their initial man-
agement strategy for patients with prediabetes (Table 2). Only
12% of providers selected referral to a behavioral weight loss
program as their initial management in actual practice. For
repeat laboratory work and follow-up visits, 88% of providers
selected between 3 and 6 months for both questions (Table 2).
Metformin use for prediabetes was uncommon; 25% of
providers never prescribed metformin (Table 2), 36% pre-
scribed it for 5% or less of their patients, while 26% prescribed
it for up to 25% of their patients. Providers were more likely to
prescribe metformin if the patient’s BMI was ≥35 kg/m2
(58%), HbA1c was ≥6% (51%) and/or the patient did not
respond to lifestyle change (63%). Sixteen percent of pro-
viders did not believe in prescribing metformin for patients
with prediabetes. Provider characteristics were not associated
with metformin use.
Forty-two percent of providers found the ADA guidelines
on prediabetes helpful in management, and 30% of providers
were unfamiliar with them.
Attitudes and beliefs about prediabetes and
management of prediabetes
The majority of providers agreed or strongly agreed that diag-
nosing prediabetes is important for managing their patients’
health (96%) and determining whether to treat comorbid con-
ditions (85%) or elevated blood sugars (87%) (Table 2). Pro-
viders also agreed (86%) that patients with prediabetes progress
to diabetes more quickly than those with normoglycemia and
that lifestyle modification reduces that progression (96%). Few-
er providers (78%) agreed that metformin can do the same.
Post-hoc analyses showed that those who disagreed or were
neutral about metformin’s ability to reduce the progression
from prediabetes to diabetes were more likely not to prescribe
metformin (adjusted percentage, 61% vs. 23%, p = 0.02).
Most providers selected lack of motivation (91%), patients’
physical limitations in doing activity (73%), and lack of
weight or nutrition resources (65–71%) as barriers to lifestyle

 modification (Table 2). Regarding interventions for improving
prediabetes management, PCPs reported that more time for
counseling (85%), more educational resources for patients
(88%), improved nutrition resources (94%) and access to
DPPs (96%) and weight loss programs (91%) would be help-
ful (Table 2).
For barriers to metformin use in prediabetes, providers
selected patients’ dislike of taking medications (89%), poten-
tial side effects (81%) and anticipated poor adherence (70%)
as influential factors (Table 2). In contrast, medication cost
(43%) and lack of FDA approval for metformin use in predi-
abetes (32%) were not common barriers.
DISCUSSION
In this study, we found important gaps in PCP knowledge of
risk factors (i.e., Asian race and Hispanic ethnicity), diagnostic
criteria and evidence-based recommendations for prediabetes.
PCPs follow their patients with prediabetes closely but infre-
quently recommend behavioral weight loss programs or met-
formin. PCPs believe that patient-related factors are important
barriers to managing prediabetes, and their own perceptions of
the harms and benefits of metformin may be limiting its use.
Although provider type was associated with knowledge of
certain diagnostic criteria, most provider characteristics were
not associated with knowledge of guideline recommendations
for prediabetes. Asian providers were more likely to correctly
identify Asian race as a risk factor compared to white providers;
in a prior study, Chinese patients whose family physicians were
also Chinese were more likely to receive recommended diabetes
care compared to patients without race-concordant providers.17
Prior literature on the current practices of PCPs regarding
prediabetes screening, diagnosis or management is sparse.
Prior studies used electronic health data and administrative
claims data to examine practices in prediabetes care but were
not specific to PCPs.14, 15 We describe PCP knowledge around
prediabetes for the first time. The clinical implications from
providers’ under- or over-estimation of laboratory diagnostic
parameters are unclear. However, given that nine out of ten
people with prediabetes are unaware of the diagnosis,2 our
work supports that low provider knowledge about risk factors
and diagnostic criteria may be contributing.
In our survey, PCPs reported following their patients with
prediabetes closely with nearly all providing counseling on
lifestyle change. However, PCPs had incomplete knowledge
of evidence-based ADA recommendations10 for specific life-
style changes (e.g., weight loss and activity goals) to prevent
diabetes. Similarly, a prior study that found only a quarter of
patients with prediabetes reported receiving recommendations
for lifestyle modification.13 Since 2003, the ADA guidelines for
prediabetes have focused on lifestyle modification for predia-
betes, and recommendations for metformin use were added in
2007.18 In our survey, nearly a third of providers reported
unfamiliarity with the ADA guidelines for prediabetes;
addressing this lack of awareness may improve delivery of
evidence-based care for prediabetes. Notably, key professional
organizations for PCPs (e.g., ACP and American Academy of
Family Physicians) do not have practice guidelines related to
prediabetes; this may contribute to what PCPs know about
prediabetes and their perspectives on its importance. Consensus
guidelines by the professional homes of PCPs may help im-
prove the identification and management of prediabetes.
Other factors may influence providers’ adherence to screen-
ing and management guidelines for prediabetes, including
inertia of previous practice,19 low self-efficacy due to a lack
of confidence in one’s ability, and lack of outcome expectancy
(i.e., expectation that a given recommendation will not lead to
an improved outcome).19 Other barriers include time con-
straints, limited staffing resources, and clinician skepticism
and knowledge of guidelines.20 At the system and practice
level, facilitators for adherence to guidelines include engaging
stakeholders, leadership support and clinical decision sup-
port.20, 21 Economic incentives may be helpful although prior
literature shows mixed results.22
Behavioral weight loss programs are very effective at
preventing or delaying diabetes onset (8, 23 24), but PCPs
infrequently recommend such programs to patients with predi-
abetes; understanding reasons for this beyond knowledge gaps
(e.g., lack of accessibility, lack of insurance coverage) is im-
portant. In terms of accessibility, the CDC is partnering with
private and public organizations through the NDPP to provide
resources and set standards for program recognition.11 Current-
ly, there are approximately 1300 DPPs across the US that are
recognized or applying for CDC recognition.11 Coverage of the
DPP by Medicare25 and other commercial insurers is expected.
As expected, metformin use for prediabetes appeared low
but was reported as higher than in prior studies using claims15
or patient self-report.26 A quarter of providers did not believe
that metformin reduces the risk of diabetes in patients with
prediabetes. This disagreement may represent some providers’
belief that treating prediabetes with metformin is similar to
treating patients early in the diabetes spectrum and may not
reduce the risk of diabetes. In the DPP Outcomes Study, while
persons on lifestyle or metformin treatment who did not de-
velop diabetes had a lower risk of microvascular complica-
tions than those who did develop diabetes, data are still lacking
on macrovascular complications.9 In a recent study of family
physicians, respondents with a more negative attitude toward
prediabetes were less likely to recommend metformin.27
PCPs identified patients’ lack of motivation as the biggest
barrier to lifestyle modification and patient-related factors,
including dislike of taking medications and poor adherence,
as barriers to metformin use. Some providers perceived the
cost of metformin as a barrier, but metformin is inexpensive.
In the family physicians survey, providers similarly felt that
patient motivation and their ability to make lifestyle change
were significant barriers to prediabetes care.27 Therefore, un-
derstanding patients’ perspectives and preferences will be key
to effectively managing prediabetes.

 Several limitations to our study deserve mention. First, this
survey was conducted among providers from multi-specialty
practices associated with a single academic medical center so
findings may not be generalizable. However, the clinic sites
are located in both the community/suburbs and city (Baltimore
City and Washington, DC). Second, there may be recall bias
(unmotivated misreporting) regarding provider practices.
Third, social desirability bias (motivated misreporting in a
socially desirable direction) may be problematic, particularly
when reporting attitudes and barriers. This bias could have led
to more respondents agreeing that prediabetes is an important
condition to identify when they do not feel this way. The
strengths of our study include a high response rate (90%), a
comprehensive, detailed survey and, to our knowledge, the
first data on PCPs’ knowledge around prediabetes.
One in three Americans are at risk of developing diabetes,
and this number continues to rise. In our sample, PCPs had
substantial gaps in knowledge about prediabetes that need to
be addressed for interventions, such as the CDC prediabetes
screening and prevention campaign,1 to be successful. Edu-
cating providers on screening guidelines, diagnostic criteria
and management options will be the important first step to
filling these gaps. The role of professional societies in improv-
ing knowledge and addressing attitudes cannot be
underestimated. Systems changes to support provider behav-
ior are also important. Despite substantial evidence for the
effectiveness of DPPs, they remain underutilized. Reasons for
this are likely complex and warrant further investigation.
Expanding insurance coverage and the availability of these
high quality, comprehensive programs are essential. With
these changes, PCPs are optimally positioned to take a lead
in curbing the diabetes epidemic.
