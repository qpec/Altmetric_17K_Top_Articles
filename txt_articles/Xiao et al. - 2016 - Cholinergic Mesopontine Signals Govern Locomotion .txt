In Brief
How mesopontine cholinergic signaling
fine-tunes the goal-directed behaviors
generated by midbrain activity is
uncertain. By optogenetically modulating
origin-specific cholinergic projections
within different midbrain targets, Xiao

mesopontine cholinergic neurons that
separately regulate locomotion and
reward.

SUMMARY
The mesopontine tegmentum, including the pe-
dunculopontine and laterodorsal tegmental nuclei
(PPN and LDT), provides major cholinergic inputs to
midbrain and regulates locomotion and reward. To
delineate the underlying projection-specific circuit
mechanisms, we employed optogenetics to con-
trol mesopontine cholinergic neurons at somata
and at divergent projections within distinct midbrain
areas. Bidirectional manipulation of PPN cholinergic
cell bodies exerted opposing effects on locomotor
behavior and reinforcement learning. These motor
and reward effects were separable via limiting
photostimulation to PPN cholinergic terminals in the
ventral substantia nigra pars compacta (vSNc) or
to the ventral tegmental area (VTA), respectively.
LDT cholinergic neurons also form connections with
vSNc and VTA neurons; however, although photo-
excitation of LDT cholinergic terminals in the VTA
caused positive reinforcement, LDT-to-vSNc modula-
tion did not alter locomotion or reward. Therefore, the
selective targeting of projection-specific mesopon-
tine cholinergic pathways may offer increased benefit
in treating movement and addiction disorders.
INTRODUCTION
The pedunculopontine nucleus (PPN) is a heterogeneous brain-
stem structure that contains cholinergic (ChAT), glutamatergic,
and GABAergic neurons (Benarroch, 2013; Jenkinson et al.,
2009). Accumulating evidence suggests that PPN ChAT neurons
play key roles in both motor and non-motor behaviors (Morita
et al., 2014). Parkinson’s disease patients with gait disorders
and postural instability display degeneration of the PPN ChAT
neurons, and the severity of balance deficits is correlated with
a reduction in PPN ChAT-neuron numbers and activity (Bohnen
et al., 2009, 2013). In parkinsonian non-human primate models,
chemical lesion of PPN ChAT neurons is necessary and sufficient
to impair gait and balance (Karachi et al., 2010). In addition
to affecting motor behavior, ChAT-neuron-selective chemical
lesions of the PPN also affect drug-seeking behavior (Lanc
¸ a
et al., 2000). These studies suggest that PPN ChAT neurons
are instrumental for normal function in movement and reward
reinforcement; however, they do not identify the downstream
effectors.
The PPN projects to multiple targets in the basal ganglia,
midbrain, cerebellum, thalamus, and the reticular formation (Bal-
langer et al., 2009; Benarroch, 2013; Dautan et al., 2014; Jenkin-
son et al., 2009; Marani et al., 2008). Although electrically and
pharmacologically stimulating PPN neurons in vivo leads to over-
all excitatory outcomes in downstream nuclei (Ballanger et al.,
2009; Blaha et al., 1996), the projections from the PPN to individ-
ual downstream neurons are complex. Two notable targets of
PPN ChAT circuitry, the substantia nigra pars compacta (SNc)
and the ventral tegmental area (VTA), are implicated in locomo-
tion and reward processing (Bermudez and Schultz, 2014;
Bromberg-Martin et al., 2010; Ikemoto, 2007; Lerner et al.,
2015; Roeper, 2013). ChAT, glutamatergic, and GABAergic neu-
rons of the PPN form convergent connections onto SNc and VTA
neurons, but their synaptic contacts with individual neurons are
often non-overlapping (Futami et al., 1995; Good and Lupica,
2009; Scarnati et al., 1986). The multifaceted roles of SNc and
VTA neurons in exploratory activity, habituation, reinforcement,
aversion (Bromberg-Martin et al., 2010; Friedman et al., 2014;
Lerner et al., 2015; Roeper, 2013; Walsh et al., 2014), and the
involvement of multiple nuclei in locomotion and reward (Benar-
roch, 2013; Bromberg-Martin et al., 2010; Ikemoto, 2007; Jen-
kinson et al., 2009; Kravitz and Kreitzer, 2012) add experimental
complexity to the assessment of how PPN ChAT tone in the VTA
and SNc patterns goal-directed behaviors. Whether selectively
and temporarily enhancing the tonic activity of PPN ChAT neu-
rons, without affecting PPN glutamatergic and GABAergic
neurons, is sufficient to recruit SNc and VTA neurons and to
regulate the aforementioned behaviors is unknown. A strategy
that enables specific modulation of ChAT projections without
perturbing glutamatergic and GABAergic projections can facili-
tate both in vitro and in vivo characterization of ChAT circuitry
originated in the PPN.
To dissect out the behavioral effect of ChAT signaling along
each PPN-to-midbrain circuit, we have employed optogenetic
tools (Gradinaru et al., 2009, 2010; Ha
¨ usser, 2014; Walsh
et al., 2014) and ChAT-Cre rats (Witten et al., 2011). Elec-
trical and chemical interventions, which are commonly used to
study the anatomy and physiology of the PPN, do not offer the

 spatiotemporal or cell-type specificity required to selectively
harness specific PPN ChAT projections to the VTA and SNc or
to examine differences in PPN cell connectivity with SNc
and VTA nuclei. Highlighting the requirement for precise spatial
targeting of neuronal manipulations, it is noteworthy that the
dorsal and ventral tiers of the SNc (dSNc and vSNc) pro-
ject to distinct sub-regions of the striatum and may have differ-
ential vulnerability to neurodegenerative assaults (Hassan and
Benarroch, 2015). Thus, they merit investigation as separate
subnuclei.
We found that optogenetic modulation of PPN ChAT somata
altered both motor activity and reward reinforcement, whereas
targeted photo-stimulation of PPN ChAT terminals in the vSNc
or VTA granted separable control of these physiological
processes. Importantly, these results do not rule out cholinergic
control of midbrain functions from non-PPN sources. Indeed,
as shown before (Chen and Lodge, 2013; Lodge and Grace,
2006; Mena-Segovia et al., 2008) and confirmed here, ChAT
neurons in the laterodorsal tegmental nucleus (LDT) also
formed functional connections with midbrain neurons. While
photo-excitation of these connections in the VTA regulated
reward reinforcement, photoexcitation of LDT ChAT terminals
in the vSNc did not alter locomotion, which contrasts with
the effects of PPN-originating cholinergic modulation. There-
fore, ChAT projections from the PPN and the LDT to the
vSNc and VTA play distinct roles in regulating motor and
reward behaviors.
RESULTS
Previous studies (Benarroch, 2013; Jenkinson et al., 2009;
Mena-Segovia et al., 2008; Oakman et al., 1995) have demon-
strated connections between PPN neurons and SNc/VTA neu-
rons by neuronal tracing and electrophysiological techniques.
As these techniques often lacked cell specificity, ChAT connec-
tions were neither imaged in intact form nor were they selectively
stimulated without also perturbing glutamatergic and GABAergic
connections. We injected adeno-associated virus serotype 5
(AAV5) carrying Cre-dependent (double-floxed inverse open
reading frame [DIO]) ChR2-eYFP into the PPN of ChAT-Cre
rats to selectively label ChAT neurons and their projections (Fig-
ure 1A). To visualize the projections to the SNc and VTA, we used
PACT clearing (Treweek et al., 2015; Yang et al., 2014) for facile
and accurate mapping of dense, long-range fibers in 1- to 2-mm-
thick brain sections. We observed ChR2-eYFP-labeled axonal
fibers from PPN ChAT neurons within both the dorsal and ventral
tiers of the SNc (dSNc and vSNc) as well as within the VTA (Fig-
ures 1B and 1C).
We confirmed the functional properties of these connections
by performing whole-cell patch-clamp recordings from SNc
and VTA neurons adjacent to ChR2-expressing PPN ChAT
axonal fibers in live midbrain slices of ChR2-injected rats (Fig-
ure 1D). ChAT neurons usually form connections with down-
stream neurons through non-synaptic volume transmission
(Miwa et al., 2011). Since ACh released in response to a short
stimulation epoch is rapidly hydrolyzed by acetylcholinesterase
before reaching its receptors, long stimulation epochs are
necessary in order for ACh to accumulate and subsequently
activate ACh receptors. Therefore, to increase our probability
of detecting existing functional ChAT transmission, we applied
5–10 s continuous blue light stimulation (Figures 1E–1G). Under
these conditions, we detected inward currents in 33%, 24%,
and 44% of vSNc, dSNc, and VTA neurons, respectively (Figures
1E–1I). Meanwhile, blue light accelerated neuronal firing (Figures
1E–1G and 1J). These data suggest that PPN ChAT neurons form
excitatory connections with SNc and VTA neurons.
Midbrain neurons contain both nicotinic and muscarinic ACh
receptors (nAChRs and mAChRs) (Drenan and Lester, 2012;
Miwa et al., 2011; Yeomans, 1995), and either are capable of
mediating the response to light-induced ChAT release. We
observed photocurrents that were not significantly changed
by atropine, a mAChR antagonist, but that were significantly
blocked by mecamylamine (MEC), a nAChR antagonist (Fig-
ure 1K; Figures S1A and S1D); furthermore, MEC also blocked
the enhancement of firing in response to photo-excitation (Fig-
ure 1E). These data suggest that nAChRs predominantly mediate
the connectivity between PPN ChAT neurons and SNc/VTA
neurons.
Given that nAChRs modulate neurotransmitter release in
midbrain (Dani and Bertrand, 2007), the nAChRs that mediate
the photocurrents could be located on the recorded neurons or
on afferent terminals releasing other neurotransmitters, such as
glutamate or GABA. To define where these nAChRs are located,
we further characterized the pharmacological properties of the
photocurrents. We observed that bicuculline (10 mM, Bic), a
GABAA receptor blocker, did not affect the photocurrents in
midbrain neurons, but 10 mM MEC blocked these currents (Fig-
ure 1K; Figures S1B and S1E). In some midbrain neurons
(8/18), the photocurrents were completely blocked by glutamate
receptor antagonists (APV and CNQX), whereas, in other neu-
rons (10/18), the combined application of APV and CNQX only
partially reduced the currents, and MEC blocked the remaining
currents (Figure 1K; Figures S1C and S1F). These results sug-
gest that nAChRs both in afferent glutamatergic terminals and
in midbrain neurons are important targets of endogenously
released ACh from PPN.
The above optogenetic tracing data (Figures 1B and 1C)
support the hypothesis that the SNc and VTA are downstream
targets of PPN ChAT neurons. Since the SNc and VTA are
involved in locomotion and reward reinforcement (Bromberg-
Martin et al., 2010; Lerner et al., 2015; Maskos, 2008; Patterson
et al., 2015; Roeper, 2013), it follows that PPN ChAT activity
may impact locomotion and reward reinforcement. To test this
hypothesis, we selectively and reversibly manipulated opsin-
expressing PPN ChAT neurons in freely behaving rats.
Similar to previous studies (Jenkinson et al., 2009), our data
illustrate that ChAT neurons reside throughout the PPN and ac-
count for almost half of all neurons in both the rostral and caudal
PPN (Figures 2A and 2B; Figure S2A). To tailor practical opto-
genetic stimulation paradigm (i.e., duration and frequency) to
modulate neurons within their spiking capability, we therefore
characterized the biophysical properties of PPN ChAT neurons
using brain-slice patch-clamp recordings (Figures 2C–2H).
Most PPN neurons fired spontaneously at <10 Hz (Figure S2B).
When increasing steps of depolarizing current were injected
into PPN neurons, the firing rates of ChAT neurons increased
334
Neuron 90, 333–347, April 20, 2016
 more than non-ChAT neurons (Figure 2E; Table S1), consistent
with our data showing that ChAT neurons had higher input
resistance (Figure 2F). The optimal stimulation duration to
evoke reliable single action potential for PPN neurons was
10 ms (Figures 2G and 2H; Figures S2C and S2D; Table S2).
Thus, we applied 10 ms light pulses to evoke action potentials
in the following ex vivo and in vivo experiments involving opto-
genetic excitation.
To achieve optogenetic control of PPN ChAT neurons, we ste-
reotaxically delivered AAV5-DIO- ChR2-eYFP or Arch3.0-eYFP
genes into the PPN of ChAT-Cre rats (Chow et al., 2010; Mattis
et al., 2012; Witten et al., 2011) (Figures 3A–3C, 3I–3K, and
4A). Whole-cell patch-clamp recordings in PPN brain slices (Fig-
ures S3A and S3D) confirmed functional expression levels of vir-
ally transduced ChR2 and Arch3 in PPN neurons: blue and green
light stimulation evoked robust photocurrents in recorded cells

 (Figures 3D and 3L; Figures S3C, S3E, and S3F) and effectively
modified the firing patterns (Figures 3E and 3L). Opsin expres-
sion was specific to ChAT neurons (Figures 3C and 3K). Addi-
tionally, blue light pulses (10 ms) reliably evoked inward currents
(Figure S3E) and action potentials (Figures 3E–3H) in PPN ChAT
neurons expressing ChR2 (Figure S3A).
To understand the behavioral contributions of PPN ChAT neu-
rons, we monitored freely moving rats for changes in locomotor
activity in response to photo-modulation of opsin-expressing
PPN ChAT neurons. For photo-excitation, we applied 20 Hz
stimuli (Figure 4A; Figure S4A) because: 20 Hz is higher than
the average spontaneous firing rates (<12 Hz) of PPN neurons
shown in our in vitro data (Figure S2B; Table S1) and in previous
in vivo studies (Norton et al., 2011), and 20 Hz is within the fre-
quency range (20–25 Hz) used for electrical stimulation of the
PPN and prior photo-excitation (at 20 Hz) of PPN ChAT neurons
that effectively enhances movement (Benarroch, 2013; Jenkin-
son et al., 2009; Plaha and Gill, 2005; Roseberry et al., 2016;
Stefani et al., 2007). To quantify locomotor behavior, we used
an open field test (see Experimental Procedures). Exposure to
ChR2-activating blue light (20 Hz, 10 ms pulse width) robustly
and reversibly increased locomotion (Figure 4B; Figure S4D).
Moreover, the enhancement of locomotion during photo-excita-
tion was abolished by MEC (2 mg/kg, i.p.) (Figures S4G–
S4I). These data indicate that increased PPN ChAT activity is
sufficient to promote locomotion by enhanced activation of
nAChRs. To test whether spontaneous firing in PPN ChAT neu-
rons is necessary to maintain normal locomotion, we photo-in-
hibited Arch3-expressing PPN ChAT neurons with continuous
green light during open field tests. Photo-inhibition significantly

 reduced locomotor activity, and this effect reversed upon light
termination (Figure 4C; Figure S4J). Neither blue nor green light
stimulation altered locomotion in control mCherry rats (Figures
4B and 4C; Figures S4B, S4D, and S4J), eliminating the possi-
bility that virus transduction or light stimulation exerted non-spe-
cific actions on locomotion. During testing, ChR2, Arch3, and
corresponding mCherry cohorts exhibited similar levels of base-
line activity (Figures S4E and S4K). These data provide a causal
link between the activity of PPN ChAT neurons and locomotion.
The PPN contains neurons that respond to either movement or
reward signals, as shown by prior in vivo single-unit recordings
(Lau et al., 2015; Norton et al., 2011; Okada and Kobayashi,
2013). Given that ChAT neurons are a dominant neuronal popu-
lation in the PPN (Figure 2B), and that PPN neuronal activity has
been linked to numerous physiological functions, our optoge-
netic modulation of ChAT-neuron activity could affect non-motor
behaviors as well. To confirm the hypothesized role of PPN ChAT
signaling in reward processing, we used a conditioned place

 preference (CPP) paradigm (Figure 4D; see Supplemental Infor-
mation) to test whether photo-excitation and photo-inhibition
of PPN ChAT neurons during place conditioning would induce
place preference and aversion, respectively (Figure 4E). On the
first day, the rats preferred the dark compartment (350–550 s)
to the white compartment (50–250 s) (Figure S5A). Therefore,
we applied a biased light-conditioning paradigm on the following
4 consecutive days. Since lesioning PPN ChAT neurons reduces
nicotine self-administration (Lanc
¸ a et al., 2000), we hypothesized
that exciting and inhibiting PPN ChAT neurons would cause
positive and negative reinforcement, respectively. In a CPP para-
digm, the time spent in the light-paired side should increase in
response to PPN ChAT photo-excitation but decrease with
PPN ChAT photo-inhibition. To avoid ceiling and floor effects

 for conditioning, we paired ChR2 rats with blue light pulses in the
non-preferred (white) compartment and Arch3 rats with green
light in preferred (dark) compartment (Figure 4E). As controls,
we paired mCherry rats with blue light pulses in the white
compartment and with green light in the dark compartment (Fig-
ure 4E). After light-conditioning, ChR2 rats exhibited a statisti-
cally significant increase in the time spent in the compartment
paired with photo-excitation (Figures 4F and 4G), whereas
Arch3 rats displayed a significant reduction in the time spent in
the compartment paired with photo-inhibition (Figures 4H and
4I). Therefore, modulation of PPN ChAT somata is also sufficient
to bidirectionally affect reward processing. Note that 4 days of
light-conditioning had only minor effects on locomotion in the
post-conditioning session (Figures S5B and S5C).
Based on our findings that optogenetic modulation of PPN
ChAT neurons modifies both motor and reward behaviors, we
reasoned that the downstream targets of ChAT projections
may be involved in conveying these behaviors. To understand
the role of PPN projections to the SNc and VTA in controlling
locomotion and reward in vivo, we restricted optogenetic modu-
lation to ChAT axon terminals in the vSNc (Figures 5A and 5B;
Figures S6A–S6C) and VTA (Figures 6A and 6B; Figures S7A–
S7C). We chose to target vSNc-projecting but not dSNc-projec-
ting fibers as the smaller size of the vSNc and its anatomical
segregation from the VTA and dSNc (Figures 1B, 5A, and 5B)
facilitate its optogenetic isolation and recruitment.
In the open field test, photo-excitation of PPN-to-vSNc projec-
tions increased locomotion (Figures 5C and 5D; Figure S6D).
Photo-excitation of terminals could potentially cause back-
propagating action potentials (Jennings et al., 2013) in the
vSNc projecting PPN ChAT neurons and recruit downstream
nuclei other than the vSNc, with the PPN-to-vSNc connection
playing only a minor role. To ensure that the vSNc was indeed
a key contributor, we photo-inhibited the projections of PPN
ChAT neurons to the vSNc in rats injected with AAV5-DIO-
Arch3.0-eYFP in the PPN (Figure 5A; Figure S6C) and observed
reduced locomotion (Figures 5E and 5F; Figure S6E), confirming
the critical role of this connection in motor control. Photo-excita-
tion of the PPN-to-vSNc projections had no effect on CPP (Fig-
ures 5G and 5H).
In contrast to PPN-to-vSNc projections, photo-excitation of
PPN-to-VTA projections did not change locomotion in the
open field test (Figures 6C and 6D; Figures S7A and S7B) but
did attenuate place aversion to the previously non-preferred

 compartment (Figures 6E and 6F) in CPP. This effect could be
related to increased activity of VTA neurons (Figures S7F–
S7H), because direct stimulation of VTA neurons is sufficient to
cause reward reinforcement (Tsai et al., 2009). We next tested
whether photo-inhibition of PPN-to-VTA projections has oppo-
site effects compared with photo-excitation of the projections.
Since Arch3.0 can have limitations for long epoch terminal inhi-
bition (Mahn et al., 2016), we virally transduced eNpHR3.0-
eYFP into PPN ChAT neurons and utilized green light to inhibit
the terminals of these neurons (Figure 6A; Figures S7C–S7E).
Conditioning eNpHR3.0-injected rats with photo-inhibition of
PPN-to-VTA projections reduced time spent in the light-paired
compartment (Figures 6G and 6H).
Collectively, the above data indicate that targeted optogenetic
modulation of PPN ChAT terminals located in the vSNc and VTA
bidirectionally affected locomotion and reward reinforcement,
respectively. In addition to the PPN, midbrain neurons also
receive cholinergic signaling from the LDT (Hassan and Benar-
roch, 2015; Maskos, 2008; Mena-Segovia et al., 2008). Pre-
vious studies reveal that LDT ChAT neurons project preferentially
to the VTA and sparsely to the SNc (Hassan and Benarroch,
2015; Mena-Segovia et al., 2008). However, it is still an open
question whether the ChAT projections from the LDT to the
midbrain have similar functions to those from the PPN. To
answer this question, we performed photo-excitation of LDT
ChAT terminals in both the VTA and vSNc. We delivered AAV5-
DIO-ChR2-eYFP to the LDT of ChAT-Cre rats; 66% (368/556)
of ChAT neurons contained ChR2 (Figures 7A and 7B). In brain
slices, photo-excitation of ChR2-eYFP expressing LDT ChAT
somata evoked inward currents and action potentials (Figure 7C);
when applied to LDT ChAT terminals, blue light evoked inward
currents in 22%, 18%, and 33% of vSNc, dSNc, and VTA neu-
rons, respectively (Figures 7D–7F). These proportions were
similar to those of midbrain neurons responding to PPN ChAT
terminal stimulation (Figures 1H and 7F). We observed that
APV+CNQX partially blocked the photocurrents in 5/10 neurons
but did not change the photocurrents in 5/10 neurons. Mean-
while, Bic did not reduce photocurrents in all 4 neurons we re-
corded. All of the remaining currents were eliminated by MEC
(Figure 7G; Figures S8C and S8D). These pharmacological prop-
erties are similar to the photocurrents in response to photo-exci-
tation of PPN ChAT terminals in midbrain except that nAChRs on

 glutamatergic terminals had less contribution to these photocur-
rents (Figure 7G versus Figure 1K).
The above electrophysiological data indicate that the LDT and
PPN ChAT neurons may have similar projections to the vSNc and
VTA and therefore mediate similar behavioral outputs. We per-
formed photo-excitation of LDT ChAT terminals in the vSNc
and VTA to test whether the modulation leads to behavioral re-
sults similar to photo-excitation of PPN ChAT terminals. In open
field tests, photo-excitation of neither LDT-to-VTA nor LDT-to-
vSNc ChAT terminals altered locomotion (Figures 7I and 7M), in
contrast to the involvement of PPN-to-vSNc projections in loco-
motion. In CPP assays, conditioning the rats with photo-excita-
tion of LDT-to-VTA ChAT projections (Figure 7H; Figure S8A)
increased the time spent inthe light-paired compartment (Figures
7J and 7K), while shining blue light on LDT-to-vSNc projections
(Figure 7L; Figure S8B) to condition ChR2 and eYFP rats caused
similar changes in their place preference (Figures 7N and 7O). The
results suggest that the PPN and LDT sends similar ChAT projec-
tions to the VTA regulating reward processing; in contrast to the
PPN, LDT ChAT signaling to the vSNc did not alter locomotion.
To map the PPN and LDT ChAT projections to the VTA and
vSNc, we injected retrograde herpes simplex viral (HSV) vectors
carrying mCherry- and eYFP-Cre (Antinone and Smith, 2010;
Nieh et al., 2015), respectively, into the vSNc and VTA (Figure 8A).
The virus is taken up by terminals and transported along the
axons to the somata, thereby labeling upstream neurons in the
PPN and LDT. In both the PPN and LDT, VTA and vSNc projecting
ChAT neurons and non-ChAT neurons were intermingled (Figures
8B and 8C). The summarized data (Figure 8D) show that more
ChAT neurons projected to the vSNc (PPN: 58%; LDT: 29%)
than to the VTA (PPN: 20%; LDT: 25%), and 14% of ChAT neu-
rons in both the PPN and LDT projected to both the vSNc and
VTA. Compared with the LDT (Figure 8D), the PPN had signifi-
cantly higher percentage of ChAT neurons projecting to the
vSNc, the VTA, or both (64% versus 40%), higher percentage
of vSNc projecting neurons (58% versus 29%), but lower per-
centage of VTA projecting ChAT neurons (20% versus 25%).
The PPN and LDT had similar percentage of ChAT neurons pro-
jecting to both the VTA and vSNc (�14%) (Figure 8D). Consistent
with previous studies (Lammel et al., 2012; Mena-Segovia et al.,
2008), ChAT neurons are not the only neuron population in the
PPN and LDT projecting to the vSNc and VTA (Figures 8B and
8C; Figure S8E). Interestingly, a great majority of vSNc and a mi-
nority of VTA projecting neurons were cholinergic (Figure S8E).
To clarify whether the projections from these two groups of
ChAT neurons are intermingled in the vSNc and VTA, we deliv-
ered AAV5-DIO-eYFP in the PPN and AAV5-DIO-mCherry in
the LDT to trace these projections (Figure S8F). We observed
that the ChAT fibers were adjacent to each other in both the
vSNc and VTA (Figure S8G). Interestingly, in the vSNc, PPN
ChAT fibers significantly outnumbered LDT fibers, which is
consistent with the retrograde tracing results and the differential
roles observed in locomotion tests.
DISCUSSION
The PPN contains heterogeneous cell populations with divergent
brain-wide projections (Benarroch, 2013; Jenkinson et al., 2009;
Mena-Segovia et al., 2008; Morita et al., 2014). It is implicated in
a broad spectrum of behaviors, including locomotion, reward,
and sleep (Arnulf et al., 2010; Benarroch, 2013; Maskos, 2008).
The link between the PPN and these behaviors has mostly
been obtained through neuromodulation with non-cell-specific
pharmacological tools, electrical stimulation, and chemical le-
sions. Optogenetics (Gradinaru et al., 2009, 2010; Ha
¨ usser,
2014; Walsh et al., 2014) and chemogenetics (Sternson and
Roth, 2014; Urban and Roth, 2015) provide tools that enable
dissection of heterogeneous PPN circuits at the level of indi-
vidual neuronal types. A few studies have taken advantage of
these techniques to selectively enhance the activity of PPN
ChAT neurons, from which it was observed that PPN ChAT
neurons significantly modulate sleep (Van Dort et al., 2015) and
motor functions (Pienaar et al., 2015; Roseberry et al., 2016).
However, the behavioral effects of modulating PPN ChAT ac-
tivity in opposing directions had yet to be explored.
We applied optogenetics to selectively target and bidirection-
ally modulate PPN ChAT neurons both at the somata and at the
terminals and further characterize the projections from these neu-
ronsto midbrainareas.First,we employedtechniquesthat enable
intact visualization of large tissue volume with high resolution
(PACT [Treweek et al., 2015; Yang et al., 2014]; Figures 1B and
1C) and imaged the projections of PPN ChAT neurons to midbrain
nuclei. Second, using retrograde HSV, we revealed that PPN
ChAT neurons projecting to the VTA and vSNc are intermingled,
and some neurons project to both the VTA and vSNc besides
separate, parallel projections (Figures 8B–8D). Third, in acute
brain slices, we applied optogenetics to stimulate endogenous
ACh release, which evoked non-synaptic responses in midbrain
neurons through activating nAChRs in the recorded neurons
and glutamatergic terminals (Figures 1D–1K; Figure S1). Although
some PPN ChAT neurons have beenreported to contain glutama-
tergic and/or GABAergic marker proteins, it remains controversial
whether these neurotransmitters are co-released from the termi-
nals (Benarroch, 2013; Jenkinson et al., 2009; Mena-Segovia
et al., 2008; Roseberry et al., 2016; Wang and Morales, 2009). In
our experiments, the extensive current attenuation by MEC
(Figures 1E–1G and 1J; Figure S1) suggests that ACh is the
main underlying neurotransmitter and co-release of other neuro-
transmitters (e.g., glutamate or GABA) plays a minor, if any, role in
PPN ChAT terminals in the midbrain, consistent with previous
studies (Roseberry et al., 2016; Wang and Morales, 2009).
PPN neurons are known to modulate motor behaviors. Electri-
cal and chemical stimulation of the PPN enhance locomotion
(Jenkinson et al., 2004), and nonspecific chemical lesion of the
PPN leads to hypokinesia (Kojima et al., 1997; Masdeu et al.,
1994). Moreover, direct in vivo electrophysiological recordings
have shown that during voluntary movement (Jenkinson et al.,
2009), imaginary motion, and passive movement (Tattersall
et al., 2014), PPN neurons exhibit disparate changes (increased,
decreased, or unchanged) in firing rates. These studies suggest
that subsets of PPN neurons may be involved in motor control.
We observed that photo-excitation of PPN ChAT neurons
(20 Hz) caused hyperactivity (Figure 4B), whereas photo-inhibi-
tion caused hypokinesia (Figure 4C). Furthermore, the hyperac-
tivity evoked by PPN ChAT-neuron stimulation was blocked by
MEC (Figures S4H and S4I), again suggesting either that these

 neurons do not co-release glutamate or that any co-released
glutamate plays only a minor role in this behavior. These results
demonstrate that bidirectional modulation of PPN ChAT neurons
is sufficient to regulate locomotion and may be a potential ther-
apeutic target for movement disorders involving both hypokine-
sia and involuntary movement.

Figure 8. Retrograde Tracing of PPN and LDT ChAT Neurons from the VTA and vSNc
(A) The diagram shows that HSV-hEf1a-eYFP-Cre and HSV-hEf1a-mCherry-Cre are respectively injected in the VTA and vSNc.
(B and C) Considerable proportions of ChAT and non-ChAT neurons in both the PPN (B) and LDT (C) were retrogradely labeled. Colored neurons (green, VTA
projecting neurons; red, vSNc projecting neurons; blue, ChAT staining); colored arrows (green, VTA-projecting ChAT neuron; red, vSNc projecting ChAT neuron;
yellow, ChAT neuron projecting to both the VTA and vSNc; open white arrow, VTA-projecting non-ChAT neurons).
(D) Percentages of PPN and LDT ChAT neurons that projected to the VTA only (green stacks), the vSNc only (red stacks), both the VTA and vSNc (yellow stacks),
and neither the VTA nor the vSNc (gray stacks). A total of 484 PPN ChAT neurons and 435 LDT ChAT neurons were counted.
(E) PPN and LDT ChAT neurons form connections with VTA neurons to a similar extent, and both modulate reward behavior; PPN ChAT neurons form stronger
connections with vSNc neurons than LDT neurons do; excitation of PPN-vSNc, instead of LDT-vSNc, ChAT terminals regulates locomotion. The PPN and LDT
neurons are respectively marked with green and orange (solid, ChAT; open, non-ChAT). Summarized data are shown as mean ± SEM.

 In addition to locomotion, the PPN is also involved in reward
processing: PPN neuronal activity changes in response to
reward signals (Norton et al., 2011), and pharmacological inhibi-
tion or lesion of PPN neurons alters established addiction
behavior, such as nicotine self-administration (Corrigall et al.,
2002; Lanc
¸ a et al., 2000). However, a causal link to a specific
neuronal population in the PPN, whose modulation can affect
reward behavior, has been lacking. Our results illustrate that
optogenetic activation of PPN ChAT neurons lends positive
emotional valence to previously aversive places (Figures 4F
and 4G). Conversely, inhibition of PPN ChAT neurons produces
place aversion (Figures 4H and 4I). Thus, PPN ChAT signaling
can bidirectionally influence reinforcement learning.
A number of elegant studies have revealed complex roles for
SNc and VTA neurons in exploratory activity, habituation, rein-
forcement, aversion, etc. (Bromberg-Martin et al., 2010; Fried-
man et al., 2014; Lerner et al., 2015; Roeper, 2013; Walsh
et al., 2014). We observed that stimulating ChAT terminals in
the vSNc and VTA respectively modulate locomotion and reward
(Figure 5), suggesting that vSNc and VTA neurons receiving
PPN ChAT innervation discriminately modulate locomotion and
reward. Compared with the locomotor and reward phenotypes
during modulation of PPN ChAT-neuron somata, terminal stimu-
lation/inhibition tended to bring about smaller effects (Figures
4B, 4C, 4G, 5C–5F, and 6F), suggesting that ChAT connections
to the vSNc and VTA may only partially mediate the roles of PPN
ChAT neurons in motor control and reward processing.
Similar to the PPN ChAT neurons (Figures 1H and 1K;
Figure S1), LDT ChAT neurons also innervate midbrain neurons
(Figures 7D–7F) through activating nAChRs on both midbrain
neurons and glutamatergic terminals (Figure 7G; Figures S8C
and S8D). Optogenetic stimulation of VTA-projecting LDT gluta-
matergic neurons has previously been found to produce place
preference (Lammel et al., 2012). Here, we observed that photo-
excitation of LDT-to-VTA ChAT projections produced similar
effects. These dual contributions of glutamatergic and ChAT
neurons to conditioned reinforcement, as well as their physiolog-
ical role in generating and maintaining burst firing in VTA neurons
(Chen and Lodge, 2013; Lodge and Grace, 2006), bolster the
role of the LDT in reward processing. By contrast, comparatively
little is known about the LDT’s contribution to locomotion. Our
anatomical data showed that LDT ChAT neurons also projected
to the vSNc (Figures 8C and 8D; Figure S8G). However, the
stimulation of these projections in vivo did not affect locomotion
and reward processing (Figures 7M–7O). Thus, although the
PPN and LDT are similar in neuronal composition, projection
pathway, and their contributions to reward processing, they
differ in their modulation of locomotion (Figure 8E). These differ-
ences and similarities align with their unique anatomical features.
While the percentages of VTA-projecting ChAT neurons are
comparable between the PPN and the LDT, noticeably more
vSNc-projecting ChAT neurons reside in the PPN (Figures 8D
and 8E).
Brain-wide persistent augmentation of ChAT tone by genet-
ically enhancing the sensitivity of nicotinic acetylcholine re-
ceptors (nAChRs), the actuators of ChAT transmission, pro-
duces a hyperactivity phenotype (Drenan et al., 2008) and
facilitates nicotine reward-related behaviors (Tapper et al.,
2004). In contrast, the knockout of major subtype of nAChRs
eliminates nicotine self-administration (Picciotto et al., 1998).
These mouse genetic studies suggest that ChAT tone plays
critical roles in both locomotion and reward reinforcement.
Our results extend these studies by showing that temporally
precise modulation of distinct ChAT pathways, originating in
the mesopontine tegmentum, can exert contrasting actions
on locomotion and reward (Figure 8E). PPN ChAT neurons
regulate locomotion and reward through divergent pathways
connecting to the vSNc and VTA, respectively. A parallel
LDT ChAT projection pathway modulates reward alone. There-
fore, to refine the therapeutic treatment of movement disor-
ders or drug addiction, it may be advantageous to specifically
target discrete mesopontine cholinergic pathways (PPN-to-
vSNc for enhancing motor function, and PPN/LDT-to-VTA for
curbing addiction).
EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURES
We used Long Evans wild-type rats and Choline acetyl-transferase (ChAT)-Cre
rats with Long Evans background (Witten et al., 2011). Animal husbandry and
all experimental procedures involving rats were approved by the Institutional
Animal Care and Use Committee (IACUC) and by the Office of Laboratory
Animal Resources at the California Institute of Technology.
Surgeries for Viral Delivery, Optical Fiber Implantation, and
Retrograde Tracing
The rats were anesthetized with 2% isofluorane gas/carbogen mixture and sta-
bilized on a stereotaxic frame (Kopf Instruments). AAV5-Ef1a-DIO-ChR2-eYFP,
AAV5-Ef1a-DIO-Arch3.0-eYFP, AAV5-Ef1a-DIO-eNpHR3.0-eYFP, AAV5-Ef1a-
DIO-mCherry, or AAV5-Ef1a-DIO-eYFP (0.8 mL, viral concentration is 4 3 1012
genome copies, UNC Vector Core) was injected in the PPN or LDT of ChAT-Cre
rats (3 months old), and custom-made optical fiber guides (300 mm in diameter)
were implanted above virus injection sites in the PPN, or above their projection
nuclei (i.e., the vSNc and the VTA). After surgery, rats were single housed on a
12 hr light/dark cycle until behavioral testing (4–6 months old) or until electro-
physiological recordings (4–7 months old).
For retrograde tracing, we injected herpes simplex virus carrying eYFP- and
mCherry-Cre (MIT Viral Gene Transfer Core) in the VTA and the vSNc, respec-
tively, and allowed the rats to recover for 3 weeks before imaging eYFP and
mCherry in PPN ChAT and non-ChAT neurons.
Brain Slice Patch-Clamp Recordings
Electrophysiological recordings were performed on parasagittal brain slices,
using the protocol described with some modifications (Xiao et al., 2015; Ye
et al., 2006) (see Supplemental Information).
In Vivo Single-Unit Recordings with Optrodes
ChAT-Cre rats injected with AAV5-DIO-ChR2-eYFP into the PPN were anes-
thetized and optrodes, made as previously described (Gradinaru et al.,
2007), were inserted into the VTA to track single-unit activity of VTA neurons
before, during, and after photoexcitation of ChR2-expressing PPN ChAT
terminals in VTA.
Immunohistochemistry
We performed immunohistochemistry with conventional histology to identify
ChR2-eYFP-/Arch3.0-eYFP-positive neurons and processes, ChAT neurons,
and DA neurons. To visualize optogenetically traced projections from PPN
ChAT neurons to midbrain, we cleared 1–2 mm brain sections from ChR2-in-
jected rats with PACT (Yang et al., 2014; Treweek et al., 2015), performed
immunohistochemistry to label ChR2-eYFP fibers and midbrain DA neurons
(Figures 1B and 5B), immersed the brain sections in refractive index matching
solution (RIMS) in 1–2 mm deep square frames (iSpacer), and imaged the sam-
ples with a Zeiss LSM 780 confocal microscope.

 Behavioral Assays
The rats with optical fiber implants were subject to open field and conditioned
place preference (CPP) assays and their behaviors were acquired with a video
camera controlled by Ethovision XT 9 software (Noldus et al., 2001).
Data Analysis
Statistical analysis was performed by SigmaPlot 11.0 (SPSS) and OpenEpi
(Dean et al., 2010). Values of p < 0.05 were considered significant.
