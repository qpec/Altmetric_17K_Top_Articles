T
he surprise question (SQ) was developed more than a 
decade ago and has been suggested as a simple test to 
identify patients who might benefit from hospice and palli-
ative care (HPC).1 It involves a clinician reflecting on the question, 
“Would I be surprised if this patient died in the next 12 months?”. It 
was thought that the SQ would correct for a physician’s tendency 
to overestimate prognosis2 by asking the physician to consider 
whether death in the coming year is possible rather than probable. 
The surprise question has been widely promoted3,4 and adopted 
into frameworks for assessing hospice and palliative care needs.5,6
In the past few years, several studies have reported on the 
accuracy of the SQ for a different purpose: as a prognostic test of 
intermediate-term death in different patient populations. These 
studies sought to determine whether an answer of “no” (hereaf-
ter SQ+) predicts intermediate-term death. We conducted a sys-
tematic review of the literature to determine the performance 
characteristics of the SQ in predicting death and the methodo-
logic characteristics of these studies.

ABSTRACT
BACKGROUND: The surprise question — 
“Would I be surprised if this patient died 
in the next 12 months?” — has been 
used to identify patients at high risk of 
death who might benefit from palliative 
care services. Our objective was to sys-
tematically review the performance 
characteristics of the surprise question 
in predicting death.
METHODS: We searched multiple elec-
tronic databases from inception to 2016 
to identify studies that prospectively 
screened patients with the surprise 
question and reported on death at 6 to 
18 months. We constructed models of 
hierarchical summary receiver operat-
ing characteristics (sROCs) to determine 
prognostic performance.
RESULTS: Sixteen studies (17 cohorts, 
11 621 patients) met the selection crite-
ria. For the outcome of death at 6 to 
18 months, the pooled prognostic char-
acteristics were sensitivity 67.0% (95% 
confidence interval [CI] 55.7%–76.7%), 
specificity 80.2% (73.3%–85.6%), posi-
tive likelihood ratio 3.4 (95% CI 2.8–4.1), 
negative likelihood ratio 0.41 (95% CI 
0.32–0.54), positive predictive value 
37.1% (95% CI 30.2%–44.6%) and nega-
tive predictive value 93.1% (95% CI 
91.0%–94.8%). The surprise question 
had worse discrimination in patients 
with noncancer illness (area under 
sROC curve 0.77 [95% CI 0.73–0.81]) 
than in patients with cancer (area under 
sROC curve 0.83 [95% CI 0.79–0.87; p = 
0.02 for difference]). Most studies had a 
moderate to high risk of bias, often 
because they had a low or unknown 
participation rate or had missing data.
INTERPRETATION: The surprise ques-
tion performs poorly to modestly as a 
predictive tool for death, with worse 
performance in noncancer illness. Fur-
ther studies are needed to develop 
accurate tools to identify patients with 
palliative care needs and to assess the 
surprise question for this purpose.

Study selection
Two authors (J.D. and R.G.) independently screened citations to 
identify potentially relevant articles or abstracts. Potentially rele-
vant citations were retrieved and reviewed independently in full 
text by the same 2 authors to determine whether they met inclu-
sion criteria: a prospective cohort study with SQ asked of study 
participants, with prospective follow-up for the primary outcome 
(death at least 6 months after SQ asked). We did not consider 
designs where the SQ was asked retrospectively because of the 
potential for biased ratings based on knowledge of patient out-
come. Reviewers were not masked to the study author, institu-
tion or journal. Because we did not wish to limit calculations to 
sensitivity, we excluded studies that provided data for outcomes 
only for patients who were SQ+, but we attempted to contact 
authors of these studies to determine whether outcomes were 
available for patients identified as SQ– (yes answer to SQ).
Data abstraction and methodologic quality
Two authors (J.D. and N.A.) abstracted in duplicate the following 
data from each study: setting; population; proportion of eligible 
patients enrolled; proportion of eligible patients with outcomes 
data; number of SQ evaluators for each patient and measure of 
agreement, if any; and outcomes (true positives, false positives, 
true negatives and false negatives). A true positive was defined 
as an answer of no to SQ for a patient who died. Two reviewers 
(J.D. and N.A.) also assessed the risk of bias of each study using 
the Quality in Prognosis Studies tool.7,8 Disagreements between 
reviewers at any stage of the review were resolved by consensus.
Statistical analysis
For each study, we constructed a 2 × 2 table (predictor, SQ; out-
come, death) and calculated the incidence of death in the study, 
sensitivity, specificity, positive likelihood ratio (LR+), negative 
likelihood ratio (LR–), positive (PPV) and negative (NPV) predic-
tive values, and diagnostic odds ratio (DOR). The DOR is the ratio 
of odds of a prediction of death (SQ+) in a patient who dies 
divided by the odds in a patient who lives, calculated as LR+ 
divided by LR–. In studies reporting more than 1 clinician rating 
the SQ we used the study’s definition of SQ+, which could require 
consensus or at least 1 rater.
We constructed a summary receiver operating characteristic 
(sROC) curve using a Rutter–Gatsonis hierarchical sROC model.9 
The ROC curve plots the true positive rate (sensitivity) against 
the false-positive rate (1 – specificity), and the area under the 
ROC curve (AUC) is a measure of discrimination, with 1 denoting 
perfect discrimination and 0.5 denoting no better than chance. 
Discrimination is the probability, given a randomly selected pair 
of patients, of whom one lives and the other dies, that the survi-
vor will be coded as SQ– and the decedent coded as SQ+. The 
hierarchical model was appropriate given that the scale parame-
ter β, which provides for asymmetry in the sROC model, was not 
significantly different from zero, and the distribution of the ran-
dom errors was normal on visual inspection. 
Based on the hierarchical sROC model, we determined the 
meta-analytic summaries of DOR, LR+ and LR–, sensitivity and 
specificity. Using the DOR, we derived the AUC and its SE based on 
the formula described by Walter.10 We also presented summary PPV 
and NPV for illustration, and acknowledged the following limita-
tions: heterogeneity may be greater than for test characteristics of 
sensitivity and specificity, and average predictive values relate to 
test utilization at some average, but unknown, incidence of death.11
For the predefined subgroup analyses of patients with cancer 
and those with noncancer illness, there were fewer studies; 
therefore, we used univariable random effects models, with each 
study weighted by the inverse of its variance for the given param-
eter. Parameters for these subgroups were compared using the z 
test. We report heterogeneity of summary estimates of diagnos-
tic performance using the I2 measure, which is the percentage of 
total variability across studies that is attributable to heterogene-
ity rather than chance, and used published guidelines for low 
(I2 25%–49%), moderate (I2 50%–74%), and high (I2 ≥ 75%) het-
erogeneity.12 To calculate I2, we used univariable models for all 
studies together and for the subgroups with and without cancer. 
Heterogeneity measures were not available for AUC estimates, 
because they were derived from the DOR. 
We assessed for publication bias using the regression test of 
asymmetry described by Deeks and colleagues,13 which is based 
on a plot of the inverse of the square root of the sample size ver-
sus the log of the DOR. The analysis was performed in SAS ver-
sion 9.3 (SAS Institute) using the MetaDAS macro for the hierar-
chical sROC model and R version 3.2.0 for the univariable 
meta-analysis. The sROC plot was generated using RevMan ver-
sion 5.3 (Cochrane Community). Ethics approval was not 
required for this study.
Results
We identified 792 citations, of which 261,14–38 were potentially rel-
evant (Figure 1). Of these studies, 7 did not include outcomes 
data for patients who were SQ–14–19,36 that were confirmed in the 
publication15–18,36 or after contact with study authors.14,19 In 3 
studies, the SQ was used only to predict 7- and/or 30-day mortal-
ity.29,37,38 Sixteen remaining studies of SQ to predict death met 
inclusion criteria1,20–28,30–35 (Table 1) and were included in the 
meta-analysis. One study provided data for a derivation cohort in 
the manuscript.20 We also obtained data from a validation cohort 
from the study authors, which we analyzed separately in the 
numerical description and meta-analyses but considered with 
the derivation cohort as a single study otherwise.
The 16 studies (17 cohorts) enrolled a total of 11 621 patients 
(mean, 683 patients per cohort, range 49–4779; Table 1). All were 
prospective studies enrolling patients in 1 centre or group1,20,22–24,26–
28,30–35 or several clinics.21,25 Five included only patients with can-
cer,25,26,28,33,35 7 included patients with renal failure,1,20,22,27,30–32 2 
included patients with end-stage heart21 or lung23 disease, 1 
included a heterogeneous population of patients with critical ill-
ness24 and 1 involved a primary care practice.34 The SQ was 
answered by physicians in 13 studies (including oncologists,26,33,35 
nephrologists,20,22,30–32 respirologists,23 intensivists,24 and general 
practitioners21,25,34), specialist nurses in 1 study,1 either a physician 
or a nurse in 1 study28 and a multidisciplinary team of 2 physicians 
and a nurse in another study.27 In each case, the assessors were

familiar with the patient. Thirteen studies asked a 12-month 
SQ,1,21–23,25–28,30–32,34,35 2 asked a 6-month SQ20,24 and 1 asked an 
18-month SQ.33
In 13 studies reporting the number of patients enrolled and 
the eligible population,1,20–22,24,26,27,30–35 the median participation 
rate was 100% (interquartile range [IQR] 98.5–100). Three studies 
reported incomplete availability of the SQ result for enrolled 
patients (85%,20 92%21 and 97%1). Of note, 1 study reported that 
the 12% of eligible patients receiving hemodialysis without a 
recorded SQ response (because the physician did not answer the 
question) had higher mortality than those with a response.20 
Among 2 studies reporting provider participation, 1 reported that 
8 of 50 (16%) general practitioners declined to participate,25 and 
another found that 5 of 16 (31%) general practitioner clinics 
declined.21 No study reported incomplete availability of status of 
death for patients with an SQ response.

In most studies, only 1 clinician answered the SQ for each 
patient.1,20,21,23–26,31,33,35 One study asked the SQ to a multidisci-
plinary team, which arrived at an answer by consensus.27 In 
1 study of patients receiving hemodialysis, every physician and 
nurse working with that patient was asked the SQ indepen-
dently; to be consistent, we considered that the patient was SQ+ 
if either of the 2 physicians attending in their unit responded 
“no” to the SQ.30 One study of patients receiving peritoneal dialy-
sis22 asked the SQ to 3 nephrologists for each patient and 
reported slight to fair39 agreement (κ 0.34–0.41).
We assessed the methodologic quality of the included studies 
using the 6 domains of the Quality in Prognosis Studies tool7 
(Table 2) and assigned an overall risk of bias for each study 
according to the highest risk score in any domain. The rationale 
behind our judgment of risk is provided in Appendix 1. Only 2 
studies were thought to have a low risk of bias in all domains; 10 
had a moderate risk of bias in at least 1 domain, and 4 had a high 
risk of bias in at least 1 domain. The test of funnel plot asymme-
try was not significant, suggesting no evidence of publication 
bias (p = 0.3).
The median incidence of death for the 17 cohorts was 15.1% 
(IQR 8.6%–20.5%). Prognostic properties of each included study 
are listed in Table 3. We contacted 6 authors to clarify or obtain 
additional data.21,26,30,31,33,35 Using data from all 17 cohorts (Table 4), 
the meta-analytic estimates were as follows: of sensitivity 67.0% 
(95% confidence interval [CI] 55.7%–76.7%), specificity 80.2% 
(73.3%–85.6%), LR+ 3.4 (95% CI 2.8–4.1), LR– 0.41 (95% CI 0.32–
0.54), PPV 37.1% (95% CI 30.2%–44.6%) and NPV 93.1% (95% CI 
91.0%–94.8%). The sROC model showed moderate discriminatory 
ability (Figure 2), with an AUC of 0.81 (95% CI 0.78–0.86).
Prognostic properties of the SQ were better in studies involving 
patients with cancer than those involving patients with noncancer 
illness (Table 4); meta-analytic estimates of DOR, PPV and AUC 
were statistically significantly different between these patient pop-
ulations. However, even in patients with cancer,25,26,28,33,35 likelihood 
estimates would generate small changes in pretest probability,

with a pooled LR+ of 4.2 (95% CI 2.9–6.0) and LR– of 0.41 (95% CI 
0.32–0.53). In studies involving patients with noncancer ill-
ness,1,20–23,27,30–32 likelihood ratios were less helpful (pooled LR+ 2.7 
[95% CI 2.1–3.6] and LR– 0.53 [95% CI 0.46–0.61]). Heterogeneity 
was absent or low for DOR and LRs, but generally high for sensitiv-
ity, specificity, PPV and NPV for both cancer and noncancer studies.
Interpretation
In this systematic review, we identified 16 studies with 17 distinct 
cohorts that studied the SQ as a tool to predict death in patients 
with serious illness. Overall, pooled results suggest poor to modest 
accuracy of the SQ for predicting death at 12 months, with low sen-
sitivity and positive predictive values for the studied populations. 
The pooled likelihood ratios are in the range of those that generate 
small changes from pretest to posttest probability.40 Prognostic per-
formance was worse for noncancer illness, missing more than one-
third of those who died and more than two-thirds of positive results 
proved to be false. The NPV of the SQ was high, meaning that SQ– 
patients (“I would be surprised if this patient died”) had a high prob-
ability of living. However, this finding was largely driven by the low 
prevalence of death in the included studies (e.g.,  if 12% of the popu-
lation dies, then a coin flip would yield an NPV of 88%). One study 
also reported only a slight to fair interobserver reliability, and most 
included studies were felt to have at least a moderate risk of bias.
Our results may not be surprising to some, because physi-
cians are inaccurate prognosticators,2 and the SQ was not origi-
nally conceived as a prognostic tool but rather as a screening 
test for patients who might benefit from a palliative approach. 
The first reported use of the SQ, albeit without outcomes data, 
was among a primary care population in Tacoma, Washington.41 
Since then, the SQ has become widely used and promoted as a 
trigger for palliative or end-of-life interventions,3,4 and has been 
incorporated as a screening test into the Gold Standards Frame-
work in the United Kingdom5 and the Necesidades Paliativas 
(NECPAL) program in Catalonia.6 
The basic assumption of the SQ as a screening test is that 
patients in their final year of life may have unmet palliative care

needs. In general, a screening test should have high sensitivity; 
lower specificity is acceptable, if the cost of a false positive is 
minimal, or if each positive on the screening test is followed by a 
more specific confirmatory test. In the case of the SQ, the sensi-
tivity is not high and, when applied to some populations, the 
number of positive results could be large: 7.7% of the population 
over age 65 years in the Osona region of Catalonia,6 up to one-
third of inpatients in 1 UK study42 and 78% of patients admitted 
with advanced congestive heart failure in the abstract of 1 study 
in the United States.43 The studies included in this meta-analysis 
had SQ+ rates that ranged from 7% to 79%. It is possible that the 
SQ is more accurate for identifying those with unmet palliative 
needs than those in the final year of life. But if being in the final 
year of life is a surrogate for unmet end-of-life care needs, includ-
ing palliative care, then our results show that the SQ will simulta-
neously generate referrals of hospice and palliative care for 
patients who may not benefit from assessment and miss many 
patients who might benefit.
The high false-positive rate may not be surprising, because cli-
nicians answering the SQ must consider whether death is possible 
rather than probable. However, several studies highlighted other 
concerns about the systematic use of the SQ. First, clinicians may 
only have moderate agreement when answering the SQ, with 
more experienced clinicians generally more accurate than those 
with less experience.30,44 Second, although many of the single-
centre studies showed a high response rate, some clinicians may 
be reluctant to adopt the SQ into routine practice;21,25,45 1 study 
reported that discomfort among staff led to the SQ being dropped 
as a trigger for a care bundle for patients in hospital.46 This dis-
comfort is an important problem for a test that depends on clini-
cian participation. Third, the poorer sensitivity and positive likeli-
hood ratio in patients with noncancer illness, such as those with 
end-stage organ failure and frailty,47,48 suggests that the SQ may 
be particularly unhelpful in this population. Fourth, physicians 
may be reluctant to commit to a positive answer on the SQ even if 
they suspect that the patient is dying.20,49 Thus, the SQ may have 
more success as a trigger for hospice and palliative care when 
used in selected settings, such as oncology, with a small number 
of experienced assessors.
It is possible that a false-positive SQ result would be beneficial, 
because a palliative approach or referral to hospice and palliative 
care may benefit patients who are not in the last year of life. The 
American Society of Clinical Oncology recommends “early” pallia-
tive care referral for patients with cancer,50 but there is no consen-
sus about the ideal timing of the referral. Two large randomized 
controlled trials (RCTs) showed a benefit to “early” referral to hos-
pice and palliative care for patients with newly detected meta-
static cancer,51,52 but neither used the SQ as a trigger. A recent 
analysis of RCTs of hospice and palliative care found that authors 
used “no clear definitions” of hospice and palliative care patients, 
and that there was a “lack of consensus concerning the attributes 
of illnesses needing palliation.”53 Although Advance Care Planning 
may be appropriate for patients at any stage of illness, some 
authors have highlighted the “Goldilocks phenomenon,” in which 
such planning may be ineffective or deleterious if implemented 
too early or too late.3 Furthermore, patients with noncancer illness

may benefit from earlier referral to hospice and palliative care, 
because they may have a longer period of high support needs.54 
But these patients can survive for years even with poor prognostic 
signs, suggesting that the burden on most hospice and palliative 
care services would be unsustainable if they were routinely 
referred early. Given the high false-positive rate, any hospice and 
palliative care  service using the SQ as a referral trigger would need 
to screen out many referrals to avoid being overwhelmed. The 
broader issue of limited hospice and palliative care resources may 
be addressed by initiatives to educate and better support primary 
care providers in delivering palliative care without referral to hos-
pice and palliative care services.
Ultimately, our findings do not indicate that the SQ is a “bad” 
or “good” test, but clinicians could benefit from better ways to 
identify patients with palliative health trajectories. One study 
reported improved prognostic accuracy by combining SQ with 
clinical predictors among a population of patients receiving 
hemodialysis.20 Conversely, 1 study in our review reported that 
the SQ no longer predicted death when included in a multivari-
able model with the Clinical Frailty Scale.32 The Gold Standards 
Framework5 and NECPAL6 both use the SQ serially with general 
and disease-specific indicators to identify those with hospice 
and palliative care needs, but the Supportive and Palliative Care 
Indicators Tool (SPICT)15 uses these indicators without the SQ, 
which was removed. Further studies will be needed to deter-
mine whether the SQ combined with other clinical indicators 
improves the identification of patients with hospice and pallia-
tive care needs.

Another study used administrative data for all nonpsychiatric 
admissions of adult patients to hospitals in Ontario and Alberta, 
and to the Brigham and Women’s Hospital in Boston to derive a 
score with excellent discrimination (AUC 0.92) for predicting 
1-year mortality among patients admitted to hospital for non-
psychiatric indications.55,56 If the findings are reproducible, the 
score could be implemented to generate automatic prompts for 
clinicians to consider discussions of advanced care planning or 
referral to hospice and palliative care. However, without a con-
sistent definition of a patient who is “palliative” or a consensus 
about what problems hospice and palliative care is meant to 
address, we do not have a gold standard to which we can com-
pare any of these triggers.
Strengths and limitations
Strengths of this systematic review include its novelty; a rigorous 
and transparent search strategy involving multiple databases; 
independent duplicate review for study selection, data abstraction 
and quality assessment; efforts to obtain unpublished data from 
primary study authors; and robust statistical methods. Limitations 
include the predominant conduct of the studies, in single centres 
with a small number of evaluators, which limited generalizability 
and assessment of interrater reliability. Many studies had method-
ologic limitations that were primarily related to incomplete partic-
ipation of eligible patients and lack of detail on whether a SQ+ 
response triggered a discussion with the patient regarding limita-

tions of life-sustaining treatments. These limitations may have led 
to overestimates of the prognostic performance of the SQ. In addi-
tion, the meta-analytic estimates of predictive values will differ in 
populations with different risks of death.
Conclusion
In summary, the SQ is intended to be a simple and feasible 
screening test to identify patients with hospice and palliative care 
needs, but it performs poorly to modestly when used to predict 
death at 6 to 18 months, with poorer performance among 
patients with noncancer illness. Based on these findings, the SQ 
should not be used as a stand-alone prognostic tool, and we do 
not know whether it is more accurate for identifying patients with 
unmet palliative needs than it is for those in the final year of life. 
The high false-positive rate for SQ may be of concern if it used as a 
routine trigger for time-consuming, costly or poorly available 
assessments for hospice and palliative care. Developing accurate, 
reliable and automated means of identifying patients with hos-
pice and palliative care needs in a variety of settings remains a 
high-priority area of research.
