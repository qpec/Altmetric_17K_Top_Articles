Introduction
Cardiovascular disease is the leading cause of mortality world-
wide (1, 2) and hypertension one of its most important modifiable 
causes. Thiazide diuretics inhibit the thiazide-sensitive sodium 
chloride cotransporter NCC in the distal convoluted tubule (DCT) 
of the kidney (3) and are among the most widely used class of 
medicines in the management of hypertension (4).
However, some patients given thiazides develop thiazide- 
induced hyponatremia (TIH) (5). Severe TIH (serum sodium <125 
mM) causes debilitating symptoms (5) and is the most common 
form of drug-induced hyponatremia requiring hospital admission 
(6). The mechanism of TIH is poorly understood. Serum sodium 
concentration in the thiazide-treated general population is virtu-
ally unchanged by thiazide therapy (7), implying that TIH occurs 
in a susceptible subgroup, but that this subgroup cannot be pro-
spectively identified, and so TIH is largely unpredictable at the 
point of thiazide initiation. Pharmacogenetic predisposition to a 
range of adverse drug effects (8–14) raises the possibility that TIH 
might also have genetic causation. This hypothesis is support-
ed by the highly reproducible nature of TIH even on single-dose 
rechallenge in individuals for whom environmental factors are 
controlled (15–17). We therefore set out to study the phenotypic 
and genetic characteristics of 2 cohorts of patients admitted to the 
hospital with severe symptomatic TIH in the United Kingdom.
Results
Characteristics of cohort 1 and cohort 2 TIH cases and controls
Two cohorts of patients of mixed European descent who were hospi-
talized with symptomatic TIH were recruited (Figure 1, Methods, and 
Supplemental Methods; supplemental material available online with 
this article; https:/
/doi.org/10.1172/JCI89812DS1). The characteris-
tics of the TIH cases and controls from cohorts 1 and 2 are presented 
in Table 1. In both cohorts, hyponatremic TIH cases on thiazides were 
typically aged over 70 years, with a predominance of females (Table 1).
Phenotypic differences between hyponatremic TIH cases on thiazides 
and normonatremic thiazide controls
Cohort 1 hyponatremic TIH cases on thiazides had lower serum 
potassium compared with cohort 1 normonatremic thiazide con-
trols (Supplemental Table 2). In cohort 2, hyponatremic TIH cases 
Thiazide diuretics are among the most widely used treatments for hypertension, but thiazide-induced hyponatremia (TIH), 
a clinically significant adverse effect, is poorly understood. Here, we have studied the phenotypic and genetic characteristics 
of patients hospitalized with TIH. In a cohort of 109 TIH patients, those with severe TIH displayed an extended phenotype of 
intravascular volume expansion, increased free water reabsorption, urinary prostaglandin E2 excretion, and reduced excretion 
of serum chloride, magnesium, zinc, and antidiuretic hormone. GWAS in a separate cohort of 48 TIH patients and 2,922 
controls from the 1958 British birth cohort identified an additional 14 regions associated with TIH. We identified a suggestive 
association with a variant in SLCO2A1, which encodes a prostaglandin transporter in the distal nephron. Resequencing of 
SLCO2A1 revealed a nonsynonymous variant, rs34550074 (p.A396T), and association with this SNP was replicated in a second 
cohort of TIH cases. TIH patients with the p.A396T variant demonstrated increased urinary excretion of prostaglandin E2 and 
metabolites. Moreover, the SLCO2A1 phospho-mimic p.A396E showed loss of transporter function in vitro. These findings 
indicate that the phenotype of TIH involves a more extensive metabolic derangement than previously recognized. We propose 
one mechanism underlying TIH development in a subgroup of patients in which SLCO2A1 regulation is altered.

reabsorption while on thiazide (Supplemental Table 3). This suggests 
that TIH cases display an exaggerated increase in free water reabsorp-
tion in response to thiazide exposure. All groups in cohort 2 were in a 
state of net free water reabsorption (Supplemental Table 3). Although 
solute-free water reabsorption was lower in cohort 2 hyponatremic 
TIH cases on thiazide than in cohort 2 normonatremic thiazide con-
trols, continued water reabsorption and production of a concentrated 
urine by hyponatremic TIH cases on thiazides is clearly inappropriate 
in the context of profound hyponatremia and intravascular volume 
expansion (as assessed by increased fractional urate clearance).
Increased fractional uric acid clearance in TIH suggests volume expansion
Increased fractional renal excretion of uric acid is observed in 
the syndrome of inappropriate antidiuretic hormone secretion 
(SIADH) and is caused by arterial blood volume expansion (18, 
19). Mean serum and urinary uric acid concentration in cohort 2 
hyponatremic TIH cases on thiazides was significantly lower than 
in cohort 2 normonatremic thiazide controls (Supplemental Fig-
ure 1). Fractional uric acid clearance in cohort 2 hyponatremic 
TIH cases on thiazides was significantly increased compared with 
both normonatremic thiazide and nonthiazide control groups and 
recovered to normal following thiazide cessation (Figure 2A).
Plasma antidiuretic hormone concentration is suppressed during TIH
Mean plasma antidiuretic hormone (ADH) concentration in cohort 
2 hyponatremic TIH cases on thiazides was significantly lower than 
in cohort 2 normonatremic thiazide controls and normonatremic 
on thiazides also demonstrated significantly (P < 10-5) lower serum 
potassium on treatment compared with off treatment. Cohort 2 
hyponatremic TIH cases on thiazides also had lower blood pres-
sure, lower blood glucose, and a lower serum concentration of 
chloride, magnesium, calcium, zinc, and vitamin D relative to 
cohort 2 normonatremic thiazide controls.
Twenty-four hour urine volume and osmolarity were significant-
ly lower in hyponatremic TIH cases on thiazides compared with nor-
monatremic thiazide controls (Supplemental Table 3). Fractional uri-
nary excretion of potassium and phosphate was reduced and that of 
zinc was increased (Supplemental Table 4). Twenty-four hour urinary 
urea excretion, an important determinant of free water clearance, 
was also significantly lower in TIH cases both on and off thiazide, 
compared with relevant controls (Supplemental Table 3).
Evaluating the baseline physiology of TIH cases after thiazide withdrawal
Serum abnormalities resolved following thiazide cessation with 
the exception of levels of chloride and zinc (Supplemental Table 2). 
Although hypochloridemia and hypozincemia improved following 
thiazide cessation, cohort 2 normonatremic case remained hypo-
chloridemic and hypozincemic 2 months after stopping thiazide 
therapy (Supplemental Table 2).
TIH cases display an exaggerated increase in free water reabsorption
Cohort 2 TIH cases reabsorbed 48% more free water when on thia-
zides compared with when off thiazides, which is in marked contrast 
with cohort 2 controls, who showed only a 9% increase in free water 
Figure 1. An overview of study recruitment of TIH cases and controls in cohort 1 and cohort 2. Cohort 1 hyponatremic TIH cases on thiazides with serum sodi-
um levels of less than 130 mM were recruited in 2002 and 2003 together with matched cohort 1 normonatremic thiazide controls. Blood was taken for DNA and 
clinical details and investigations recorded. Cohort 2 hyponatremic TIH cases on thiazides with serum sodium levels of less than 130 mM were recruited from 
2012 to 2015. Blood was taken together with 24-hour urine collection. DNA was extracted from the blood and extensive electrolyte and hormonal phenotyping 
undertaken. TIH cases were reviewed and phenotyping blood and urine samples repeated after 2 months off thiazide (termed cohort 2 normonatremic TIH 
cases off thiazides). Two matched control groups were recruited in cohort 2; the first were normonatremic and took thiazides (termed cohort 2 normonatremic 
thiazide controls), and the second were normonatremic but did not take thiazides (termed cohort 2 normonatremic nonthiazide controls).

In our GWAS data set, rs4854769, the intronic sentinel SNP 
within SLCO2A1 showed association with TIH at P = 3.92 × 10–6 
(odds ratio [OR] = 2.58). Targeted resequencing of SLCO2A1 in 
cohort 1 TIH cases and cohort 1 controls confirmed the presence 
of the nonsynonymous variant encoding p.A396T (rs34550074) 
in complete linkage disequilibrium (r2 = 1) with the sentinel GWAS 
SNP rs4854769. Association with rs34550074 between cohort 1 
cases and the carefully phenotyped normonatremic cohort 1 con-
trols on thiazide was observed at P = 0.0005 (OR = 3.3; Bonferroni’s 
corrected threshold with α 0.05 = 0.0017; Supplemental Table 7). 
The minor allele frequency (MAF) of rs34550074 in cohort 1 TIH 
cases was 0.35 (54% of TIH cases in cohort 1 carry at least 1 copy 
of the variant allele) compared with 0.14 in cohort 1 controls (25% 
carry at least 1 copy of the variant allele) and 0.18 in HAPMAP_CEU.
The total burden of rare protein-altering variants in other genes 
prioritized by the GWAS did not differ significantly between cohort 
1 cases and controls after correcting for multiple testing (Supple-
mental Table 8). SLCO2A1 was nominally associated by the c-α 
test (P = 0.0019), driven by the association with p.A396T. Sanger 
sequencing also confirmed the presence of rs34550074 in cohort 1 
hyponatremic TIH cases on thiazides (Supplemental Figure 5).
TIH cases off thiazides (Figure 2B). Although plasma ADH concen-
tration increased in TIH cases after thiazide cessation and resolu-
tion of hyponatremia, ADH remained lower in normonatremic TIH 
cases off thiazide than in normonatremic nonthiazide controls.
Results of genetic studies
GWAS. We undertook a GWAS using the cohort 1 cases and con-
trols from the 1958 British birth cohort. Given the limited num-
ber of cases available in cohort 1, we used a predefined cutoff 
for signals of interest showing suggestive association of P < 10–5. 
After quality control filters were applied (see Methods), 502,663 
SNPs from 48 cohort 1 hyponatremic cases on thiazides and 2,905 
controls remained for association testing. The genomic inflation 
factor (λ = 1.007) and the resultant quantile-quantile (QQ) plot 
(Supplemental Figure 2) were not indicative of inflation of test 
statistics due to population substructure. In total, 17 SNPs within 
14 regions were identified as showing suggestive association with 
TIH (P < 10–5) (Supplemental Figures 3 and 4 and Supplemental 
Table 6). Of these, we chose SLCO2A1 for performing additional 
studies, given its potential role in altered prostaglandin transport 
and regulation of water reabsorption in the kidney.

staining was detected in the proximal straight tubule, with compar-
atively weaker labeling of outer medullary collecting ducts and no 
PGT expression in the thick ascending limb loop of Henle (Figure

tion by phosphorylation. Accordingly, we substituted Glu for Thr, 
since the charge and size will mimic phospho-Thr and recapitulate 
physiological effects of phosphorylation at a regulatory site. Figure 
2E shows that the 396Glu moiety had a transport rate of 65% com-
pared with 396Ala, suggesting that the 396Thr variant may result 
in reduced PGT function relative to 396Ala.
Discussion
TIH remains a substantial clinical problem: population-based 
studies suggest that as many as 9% of subjects taking a thiazide 
may develop hyponatremia. Here, we report the largest and 
most detailed phenotypic description of TIH patients to date. 
In addition, we suggest a possible mechanism that may under-
lie TIH in some patients.

and normalized after thiazide cessation. Analysis of urinary pros-
taglandin concentration by SLCO2A1 p.A396T status in cohort 2 
demonstrated that TIH cases who carry at least 1 variant allele have 
significantly elevated urinary PGE2 and PGE2M concentrations rel-
ative to those homozygous for A396 (Figure 2, C and D). No such 
effect was observed in cohort 2 normonatremic thiazide controls.

Systematic review of existing data suggests that TIH affects 
an older and predominantly female demographic with low serum 
osmolality, and limited spot urine testing suggests inappropriately 
concentrated urine and saliuresis (21). Our study supported this 
and also demonstrated a phenotype resembling SIADH, with low 
plasma osmolarity, inappropriately concentrated urine, more than 
minimal urinary sodium excretion, and normal thyroid function, 
but with low or normal ADH levels. Moreover, the phenotype of 
TIH also involved severe hypochloridemia, mild hyperglycemia, 
and intravascular volume expansion. Hypochloridemia and hypoz-
incemia improved following thiazide cessation, but remained 
present 2 months after thiazide medication was stopped. Acutely 
hyponatremic TIH cases on thiazides demonstrated inappropriate 
net free water reabsorption and an exaggerated increase in free 
water reabsorption in response to thiazide exposure. This study 
therefore suggests there is much more to the phenotype of acute 
TIH than has been previously described. There are also pheno-
typic abnormalities that far outlast any kinetic or dynamic effect 
of thiazide medications, raising the possibility that such features 
might be present at baseline before thiazide commencement.
Having defined the phenotype of TIH, we set out to identify 
possible genetic predisposition to this condition. Given the small 
number of cases available in our initial cohort, we chose to prioritize 
GWAS associations with suggestive evidence for follow-up using a 
less conservative P value cut off (P < 10–5). We focused on SLCO2A1 
(encoding PGT) because augmented renal water reabsorption 
seemed most relevant to the principal abnormality of hyponatremia 
from our phenotype studies. PGT is known to regulate this process, 
and there was direct association between a protein-altering variant 
in SLCO2A1 (p.A396T) and TIH. This association was replicated in 
a second independent cohort. SLCO2A1 p.A396T was twice as fre-
quent in TIH cases compared with control and general populations, 
with approximately half of all TIH patients carrying this variant. In 
vitro data suggest that this variant may reduce PGT activity and lead 
to the higher urinary PGE2 concentrations observed in TIH patients 
who carry the variant allele. However, since half of TIH patients do 
not carry the SLCO2A1 variant and at least a quarter of unaffected 
patients do, other genetic or environmental determinants must also 
contribute to the development of TIH.
One potential criticism of this study is the limited sample size 
in the discovery cohort. This was inevitable, since we were careful 
to include only those with severe thiazide-induced hyponatremia 
and excluded those who lacked mental capacity or who had rele-
vant comorbidities.
So how does one reconcile suppressed ADH with elevat-
ed PGE2 and intravascular volume expansion? And how might a 
reduction in SLCO2A1 activity cause TIH? SLCO2A1 is expressed 
at the apical membrane of the renal collecting duct, where it scav-
enges newly synthesized PGE2 away from luminal EP4 receptors 
(22, 23). Activation of these apical EP4 receptors increases the 
water permeability of this nephron segment 10- to 15-fold, even 
in the absence of ADH (24, 25). Thus, reduced activity of collect-
ing duct apical SLCO2A1 would be predicted to increase hydrau-
lic conductivity of the collecting duct, even in the absence of 
ADH (Figure 4). Although urinary osmolarity in the TIH subjects 
was 15% higher than in control subjects (Supplemental Table 3) 
(probably as a result of increased renal medullary PGE2; ref. 26), 
which would mitigate water reabsorption, the proportionally larg-
er increase in collecting duct water permeability observed would 
more than offset the slight reduction in osmotic driving force.
Although the putative effects of SLCO2A1 inactivation appear 
to be compensated under normal conditions, they are made man-
ifest when the patients are given a thiazide diuretic. Thiazides 
reduce the ability of the late diluting segment (DCT) to gener-
ate solute-free water directly and also act by reducing effective 
vascular volume and thus solute delivery from the end-proximal 
tubule (27). We suggest therefore that, in individuals carrying the 
SLCO2A1 A396T variant, the combination of thiazide- 
specific

SLCO2A1 in contributing to TIH in 
individuals carrying the SLCO2A1 
A396T variant. (A) Under low ADH 
conditions, apical PGT in the renal col-
lecting duct scavenges PGE2 from the 
lumen, resulting in AQP2 internaliza-
tion and minimal osmotic water reab-
sorption. (B) With reduced or absent 
apical PGT, PGE2 reaching the lumen is 
able to stimulate apical EP4 receptors, 
resulting in insertion of AQP2 and 
osmotic water reabsorption.

using standard methods so as to generate cDNAs encoding amino 
acids Ala, Thr, or Glu at position 396. DNA sequences were confirmed 
by direct sequencing. Human embryonic kidney (HEK) cells were 
transiently transfected with one of the 3 cDNAs, and the timed uptake 
of 3H-PGE2 was assayed as described previously (26).
Statistics. Significance between groups was assessed using a 
2-tailed Student’s t test. Where comparisons between more than 2 
groups were undertaken, 1-way ANOVA and Bonferroni’s post hoc 
test were used. The data were analyzed using Graph Pad Prism V6.05. 
 
P < 0.05 was considered significant. Statistical methods used for 
GWAS and resequencing experiments are contained within the rele-
vant Methods and Supplemental Methods sections.
Study approval. This study was conducted in line with the stan-
dards of ICH/Good Clinical Practise sections 8.2.8 and was given 
approval by the Queen’s Medical Centre Ethics Committee (cohort 1; 
reference GM030208) and the UK National Research Ethics Commit-
tee (cohort 2; reference 11/EM/0233). Written informed consent was 
received from participants prior to inclusion in the study.

effects on free water generation and the increase in collecting 
duct water permeability from reduced SLCO2A1 activity combine 
to produce TIH (Figure 4).
Methods
Clinical recruitment. Two cohorts of patients of mixed European descent 
hospitalized with symptomatic TIH were recruited (Figure 1 and Sup-
plemental Methods). Cohort 1 comprised 48 hyponatremic TIH cases 
on thiazides (serum sodium < 130 mM) recruited during their acute 
admission to Nottingham University Hospitals NHS Trust and matched 
healthy normonatremic thiazide controls from primary care. Cohort 2 
comprised a further 109 hyponatremic TIH cases on thiazides recruit-
ed during their acute admission to the same hospital together with 2 
matched control groups from primary care (cohort 2 normonatremic 
thiazide controls and cohort 2 normonatremic nonthiazide controls). 
Cohort 2 TIH cases were also assessed 2 months after thiazide cessation 
(termed cohort 2 normonatremic TIH cases off thiazides).
GWAS. A GWAS was performed using 48 cohort 1 TIH cases gen-
otyped using the Illumina Omni1quad array and 2,922 general popula-
tion controls from the British 1958 birth cohort (28), genotyped using 
the Illumina 1.2M chip. Controls were all aged 44 to 45 years at the time 
of DNA collection (2002 to 2004) and 48% were female. Following 
quality control of the genotype data (Supplemental Methods), 502,663 
SNPs that were genotyped in both cases and controls remained for 
association testing. A case-control association analysis was undertak-
en using a logistic regression model, with adjustment for 10 principal 
components and assuming an additive genetic model, using Plink v 1.07.
Resequencing and replication studies. 101 samples (48 cohort 1 hypo-
natremic TIH cases on thiazides and 53 cohort 1 normonatremic thi-
azide controls) underwent resequencing of the genes nearest to SNPs 
that were associated with TIH at P < 10–5, followed by association 
testing (Supplemental Table 7 and Supplemental Methods). Next Gen-
eration sequencing data were deposited at the European Nucleotide 
Archive (ENA accession number PRJEB21924; http:/
/www.ebi.ac.uk/
ena). Replication for one SNP of interest identified in the sequencing 
analysis of cohort 1 (rs34550074, p.A396T) was undertaken using 
Sanger sequencing in the second cohort of TIH cases and controls 
(Supplemental Methods). Rare variant association was carried out 
using Plink/Seq (29). Rare variants were assessed using the burden 
test, which is a collapsing allelic sum test using adaptive permutation to 
derive an empirical P value. Combined rare and common variants were 
also assessed using the c-α test (30), also implemented in Plink/Seq.
Kidney immunofluorescence. Formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded 
human tissue sections were obtained from the Cambridge Human 
Research Tissue Bank. After antibody labeling, confocal imaging was 
performed (Supplemental Methods).
