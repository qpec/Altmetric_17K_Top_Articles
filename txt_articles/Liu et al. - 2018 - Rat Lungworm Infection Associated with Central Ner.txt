Angiostrongyliasis is caused by infection and migration to 
the brain of larvae of the parasitic nematode Angiostrongylus 
cantonensis, or rat lungworm. Adult A. cantonensis reside in the 
lungs of the definitive wild rodent host, where they produce 
larvae passed in feces, which are then ingested by snails and 
slugs (gastropods). Human infection typically occurs when gas-
tropods containing mature larvae are inadvertently ingested by 
humans. Although human infection often is asymptomatic or 
involves transient mild symptoms, larval migration to the brain 
can lead to eosinophilic meningitis, focal neurologic deficits, 
coma, and death. The majority of cases of human angiostron-
gyliasis occur in Asia and the Pacific Islands, including Hawaii, 
but autochthonous and imported cases have been reported in 
the continental United States (1,2), underscoring the impor-
tance of provider recognition to ensure prompt identification 
and treatment. The epidemiologic and clinical features of 12 
angiostrongyliasis cases in the continental United States were 
analyzed. These cases were identified through A. cantonensis 
polymerase chain reaction (PCR) testing (3) of cerebrospinal 
fluid (CSF) submitted to CDC from within the continental 
United States. Six cases were likely a result of autochthonous 
transmission in the southern United States. All 12 patients had 
CSF pleocytosis and eosinophilia, consistent with eosinophilic 
meningitis. Health care providers need to be aware of the 
possibility of angiostrongyliasis in patients with eosinophilic 
meningitis, especially in residents in the southern United 
States or persons who have traveled outside the continental 
United States and have a history of ingestion of gastropods or 
contaminated raw vegetables.
Cases of human angiostrongyliasis were identified through 
review of results of A. cantonensis PCR (3) testing performed 
at CDC on CSF specimens from January 2011, when this 
test became available, through January 2017. A presump-
tive case was defined as detection of A. cantonensis DNA by 
PCR testing of a clinical CSF specimen submitted to CDC 
by a diagnostic laboratory located in the continental United 
States. A confirmed case was a presumptive case with health 
care provider documentation of clinically compatible disease. 
Clinical and epidemiologic information was also obtained 
directly from providers based on review of medical records 
with patient consent and, when available, from published case 
reports. Abstracted data included vital signs, clinical signs and 
symptoms at the time of initial evaluation, hospital course, 
clinical progression, and laboratory data.
A. cantonensis DNA was detected in 34 (49.3%) of 69 per-
sons whose CSF specimens were received and tested by CDC 
during January 2011–January 2017. Specimens from 17 of 
these 34 patients were submitted from within the continental 
United States and, therefore, were considered presump-
tive angiostrongyliasis cases. In one presumptive case, the 
patient was determined by the provider to have an alternative 
diagnosis, and the PCR result (which required >32 cycles to 
detect DNA) was considered to be a false positive. Among 
the remaining 16 presumptive cases, the median patient age 
was 20 years (range = 1–68 years), and 10 were male. The 16 
patient specimens were submitted from eight states, including 
six from California, four from Texas, and one each from Utah, 
Colorado, Arizona, Alabama, Tennessee, and New York. Eight 
patients had traveled to areas outside the continental United 
States (Asia, the Caribbean, or Pacific Islands) during the 
12 months preceding initial evaluation, six (four in Texas and 
one each in Tennessee and Alabama) had no history of travel 
outside the continental United States, and the travel history 
was unknown for two patients in California.
Six of 11 patients reported consumption of raw vegetables, 
three from local gardens (Table 1). Two of 12 patients had 
consumed raw snails and for two others, family members 
reported the presence of snails in the environment. Two of 
nine patients reported consumption of prawns (with one 
patient specifying the prawns as being cooked), and one of 
nine patients ate cooked crab. One of 11 patients was reported 
to have consumed slugs, and one had possible exposure to 
slugs. Among the six patients who had not traveled outside the 
continental United States, two had consumed raw vegetables, 
three had possible exposure to snails or slugs, and one had a 
history of geophagia.
A diagnosis of angiostrongyliasis was confirmed in 13 of the 
16 presumptive cases from providers (10 patients), published 
case reports (two) (1,4), and personal communications (one). 
Complete clinical information was available for 12 of these 
patients (Table 2). The most frequently reported symptoms 
were subjective fever, generalized weakness, headache, and 
numbness/tingling. Neurologic exam findings during initial 
evaluation included cranial nerve deficits (five of 11), nuchal

rigidity (four of 12), focal weakness (three of 10), and paresthe-
sias (one of eight). Irritability was noted in three patients, two 
of whom also had ataxia during the initial evaluation; a separate 
patient had ataxia at 20 days. During initial evaluation, 10 of 12 
patients had peripheral eosinophilia (>600 eosinophils/mm3). 
All 12 patients with CSF microscopy and chemistry results had 
pleocytosis during initial evaluation; 10 had CSF eosinophilia 
(≥10% of all leukocytes in CSF or ≥10 eosinophils/mm3) on 
initial evaluation and two on subsequent lumbar puncture. 
Six of 11 patients also had hypoglycorrhachia (CSF glucose 
<40 mg/dL) at the time of initial evaluation. Repeat lumbar 
punctures were performed in eight of 11 patients. On mag-
netic resonance imaging or computed tomography, eight of 11 
patients had brain abnormalities, and five of six had spinal cord 
abnormalities. Abnormalities were also observed in the optic 
nerve of two patients. A chest computed tomography scan in 
one patient had multiple small focal areas of consolidation.
Eleven of 12 patients with confirmed cases received sys-
temic steroids, as advised in treatment recommendations (5). 
Seven patients received an antiparasitic (albendazole). Two 
months after initial evaluation, all 12 patients were alive, 11 
had improvement of symptoms, and four had ongoing focal 
neurologic symptoms (cranial nerve palsies or lower extremity 
weakness). Only one patient developed seizures (5 months 
after the initial diagnosis) for which antiepileptics were given.
Discussion
Among 12 confirmed cases of angiostrongyliasis in the 
continental United States during January 2011–January 
2017, six likely resulted from autochthonous transmission 
in the southern United States. The possibility of autochtho-
nous transmission is supported by evidence of infection with 
A. cantonensis among intermediate snail hosts and nonhuman 
vertebrate hosts in the southern United States. Infection has 
been observed in exotic and native snail species in Florida and 
Louisiana (6,7) and in rat species in Louisiana, Florida, and 
Oklahoma (6). Infection with larvae has been documented 
in other vertebrates including opossums and nine-banded

armadillos in Louisiana and Florida (8), an American miniature 
horse in Mississippi, and captive exotic primates in Louisiana, 
Florida, and Alabama (7).
The majority of patients in this series had subjective fever, 
generalized weakness, headache, and CSF pleocytosis consis-
tent with meningitis. Most also had presence of eosinophils 
in both peripheral blood and CSF, and hypoglycorrhachia, 
which is usually associated with bacterial, fungal, or tuber-
culous meningitis. All 12 patients eventually developed CSF 
eosinophilia, as did all hospitalized patients during a 2000 
outbreak of eosinophilic meningitis caused by A. cantonensis 
among travelers to the Caribbean (2). Although no specific 
treatment for A. cantonensis infection currently exists (https://
www.cdc.gov/parasites/angiostrongylus/), nearly all patients 
in this series were treated with systemic steroids, which have 
been determined to decrease the duration of headaches (5), and 
approximately half of patients were treated with albendazole, 
for which conflicting evidence of efficacy in treating headache 
can be found (9,10). Whether these treatments affected the 
clinical course for these patients is unclear.
The findings in this report are subject to at least two 
limitations. First, all cases in this series were identified from 
specimens tested at CDC, and consequently might not be a 
comprehensive description of all illnesses caused by A. cantonensis 
in the continental United States during this time. Second, 
exposures are incompletely reported in some cases, and clinical 
histories from three presumptive cases could not be obtained.
Health care providers in the United States, especially those 
in areas in the southern United States where autochthonous 
cases have been reported, need to be aware of the possibility 
of angiostrongyliasis in patients with eosinophilic meningitis. 
Ingestion of gastropods or locally obtained raw vegetables* 
contaminated with A. cantonensis larvae in the southern United 
States, even in the absence of a travel history, should increase 
provider suspicion for angiostrongyliasis.

* Because cooking is not feasible for much of the potentially contaminated 
produce (e.g., lettuces), actions that might be taken to prevent Angiostrongyliasis 
are removing snails, slugs, and rats found near houses and gardens and 
thoroughly washing produce, especially if eaten raw.
Summary
What is already known about this topic?
Ingestion of snails or slugs containing Angiostrongylus 
cantonensis larvae can result in angiostrongyliasis, characterized 
by eosinophilic meningitis. Angiostrongyliasis typically occurs 
in Asia and the Pacific Islands.
What is added by this report?
CDC identified 12 angiostrongyliasis cases in the continental 
United States occurring from January 2011 through January 
2017. Consumption of raw vegetables was reported in the 
majority of cases (55%). Six were likely autochthonous cases 
occurring in the southern United States.
What are the implications for public health practice?
Health care providers, especially those in the southern United 
States, need to consider angiostrongyliasis in patients with 
eosinophilic meningitis, particularly those with a history of 
ingestion of gastropods or raw vegetables contaminated 
with larvae.
