Abstract
Delayed hematopoietic recovery contributes to increased infection risk following umbilical cord 
blood (UCB) transplantation. In a Phase 1 study, adult recipients of UCB stem cells cultured ex 
vivo for 3 weeks with nicotinamide (NiCord) had earlier median neutrophil recovery compared to 
historical controls. To evaluate the impact of faster neutrophil recovery on clinically relevant early 
outcomes, we reviewed infection episodes and hospitalization during the first 100 days in an 
enlarged cohort of 18 NiCord recipients compared to 86 standard UCB recipients at our 
institution. Median time to neutrophil engraftment was shorter in NiCord than in standard UCB 
recipients (12.5 days vs. 26 days, p<0.001). Compared to standard UCB transplantation, NiCord 
recipients had significantly reduced risk for total infection (RR 0.69, p=0.01), grade 2–3 (moderate

 to severe) infection (RR 0.36, p<0.001), bacterial infection (RR 0.39, p=0.003), and grade 2–3 
bacterial infection (RR 0.21, p=0.003) by Poisson regression analysis; this effect persisted after 
adjustment for age, disease stage, and grade II–IV acute GVHD. NiCord recipients also had 
significantly more time out of the hospital in the first 100 days compared to standard UCB 
recipients after adjustment for age and KPS (69.9 days vs. 49.7 days, p=0.005). Overall, 
transplantation of NiCord was associated with faster neutrophil engraftment, reduced total and 
bacterial infections, and shorter hospitalization in the first 100 days compared to standard UCB 
transplantation. In conclusion, rapid hematopoietic recovery from an ex vivo expanded UCB 
transplantation approach is associated with early clinical benefit.
Introduction
Umbilical cord blood (UCB) extends the curative potential of stem cell transplantation to 
adult patients without an HLA compatible donor.1 After UCB transplantation, overall 
survival is comparable to matched related or unrelated donor transplantation, but treatment 
related mortality is significantly higher.2, 3 UCB grafts are limited by low total and stem cell 
doses that are associated with delayed hematopoietic and immunologic recovery. Delayed 
neutrophil engraftment likely contributes to increased risk of life-threatening infection and 
longer hospitalization in the early post-UCB transplantation period.4, 5
In order to overcome the limitation of low UCB cell dose, several techniques have been 
developed to expand cord blood-derived hematopoietic stem and progenitor cells ex vivo 
prior to transplantation.6, 7 While each technique employs a different mechanism for ex vivo 
expansion, all have shown promise in reducing the time to neutrophil and platelet 
engraftment.8–11 NiCord is an UCB-derived cell product that uses a small molecule, 
nicotinamide, to inhibit differentiation and enhance functionality of hematopoietic stem and 
progenitor cells (HSPC) expanded in ex vivo culture.12 The NiCord graft consists of two 
fractions from the UCB unit. The CD133 positive fraction containing HSPCs is expanded 
for 21 days in the presence of hematopoietic stem cell active cytokines plus nicotinamide. 
The CD133 negative fraction containing lymphoid cells is retained, cryopreserved and 
ultimately co-infused with the expanded CD133 positive cell fraction on the day of 
transplantation. Results from a phase I trial of transplantation with NiCord along with a 
second unmanipulated UCB unit showed earlier median neutrophil recovery compared to 
historical controls, and long term engraftment with the NiCord unit was also observed in the 
majority of patients.10 Rapid neutrophil recovery has also been observed in a subsequent 
ongoing phase II trial exploring the use of NiCord as a single unit graft.13
Since use of the NiCord ex vivo expanded UCB graft resulted in rapid hematopoietic 
recovery, we hypothesized that NiCord transplantation would improve clinically relevant 
early outcomes by decreasing risk of infection and length of hospitalization. Therefore, we 
analyzed infection episodes and hospitalization during the first 100 days after transplantation 
in an enlarged cohort of patients undergoing NiCord transplantation compared to a historical 
control of consecutive adult patients undergoing standard UCB transplantation at our 
institution.

 Methods
Patients and Transplantation Approach
Two cohorts of adult patients ≥ 18 years old with hematologic malignancies who underwent 
umbilical cord blood transplantation at Duke University were compared in this study. Cohort 
1 included 18 consecutive adults transplanted with expanded NiCord grafts as part of two 
Phase I and II clinical trials from January 2010 to March 2015.10, 13 Cohort 2 included 86 
consecutive adults transplanted with unmanipulated standard single or double umbilical cord 
blood grafts from January 2005 to March 2015. All patients received a myeloablative total 
body irradiation 1350 cGy (TBI) and fludarabine 160 mg/m2 (Flu)-based conditioning 
regimen. No patient received in vivo T cell depletion. Cord blood units were matched to the 
recipient at 4 or more HLA loci (intermediate-resolution for A and B, high-resolution for 
DRB1). In Cohort 1, 11 of 18 patients received double UCB transplantation with one 
NiCord expanded cord blood unit of minimum 1.5 × 107 TNC/kg and one unmanipulated 
cord blood unit of minimum 2.5 × 107 total nucleated cells per kilogram recipient body 
weight (TNC/kg) as previously described.10 The other seven patients in cohort 1 were 
transplanted at Duke Medical Center with a single NiCord expanded cord blood unit of 
minimum 1.8 × 107 TNC/kg prior to expansion as part of a multicenter Phase II trial.13 In 
Cohort 2, patients received either a single cord blood unit with minimum cryopreserved cell 
dose of 3 × 107 TNC/kg or two cord blood units each containing a minimum cryopreserved 
cell dose of 1.5 × 107 TNC/kg. Graft versus host disease (GVHD) prophylaxis consisted of 
tacrolimus (target level 10–15 ng/mL) for at least 6 months and mycophenolate mofetil for 
at least 60 days after transplantation. Unless contraindicated, patients from both cohorts 
received antimicrobial prophylaxis with acyclovir 800 mg twice daily to day +365, 
ciprofloxacin 500 mg twice daily to day +180, voriconazole 200 mg twice daily to at least 
day +100, and trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole 400/80 mg once daily to at least day +180 
following transplantation. Supportive care measures including evaluation and management 
of febrile neutropenia, weekly PCR surveillance for cytomegalovirus (CMV; for the entire 
study period) and human herpesvirus (HHV)-6 viremia (starting in 2010), and infection 
control practices were conducted per institutional protocol in both cohorts. G-CSF (5 µg/kg) 
was administered daily starting on day 1 after transplantation until the absolute neutrophil 
count (ANC) exceeded 1,000 cells per µL blood. Patients were eligible for discharge from 
the hospital when the ANC exceeded 500 cells per µL blood.
Definitions
The time to neutrophil engraftment was defined as the first of three consecutive days with an 
absolute neutrophil count of 0.5 × 109 per liter or higher. Disease status at the time of 
transplantation was categorized as “early” for patients with acute leukemia in first complete 
remission (CR), myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS) untreated or in first CR, chronic 
myelogenous leukemia in first chronic phase, or non-Hodgkin’s lymphoma (NHL) or 
multiple myeloma in first CR; all other patients were considered “non-early”.14 Acute graft 
versus host disease (GVHD) was defined and graded according to standard criteria.15

 Infection Data
Early infection episodes through day 100 after transplantation were retrospectively identified 
and categorized by organism type and severity per BMT CTN Technical MOP Version 3.0, 
Appendix 4-A (supplemental Table 1). Recurrence interval definitions in Appendix 4-A 
were also utilized to determine whether a given infection was part of a prior episode or new. 
Each new infection episode was first classified by type as bacterial, fungal, viral, parasitic, 
or non-microbiologically defined, then further characterized by severity as grade 1 (mild), 
grade 2 (moderate), or grade 3 (severe/life-threatening). Patients were considered at risk of 
early infection through day 100 after transplantation, day of relapse, day of second 
transplant, or day of death, whichever happened first.
Hospitalization Data
Hospitalization was defined as “days alive and out of the hospital in the first 100 days” in 
order to account for the incongruous association of earlier mortality with shorter 
hospitalization, as previously reported by Ballen and colleagues.5 For patients who survived 
to day 100, “days alive and out of the hospital in the first 100 days” was calculated by 
subtracting the total number of days in the hospital during the initial admission and any 
readmissions from 100. For patients who died before day 100, “days alive and out of the 
hospital in the first 100 days” was calculated by subtracting the total number of days in the 
hospital during the initial admission and any readmissions from the day of transplantation to 
the day of death. In this way, if a patient’s death occurred during the initial hospitalization, 
then there were no days alive and out of the hospital.
Statistical Analysis
Patient baseline and transplant characteristics were compared using the Fisher’s exact test 
and t-test for categorical and continuous variables, respectively. The cumulative incidence of 
neutrophil recovery was compared between study groups with death, relapse, or subsequent 
transplant as competing risks, and the hazard ratio (HR) and 95% confidence interval (CI) 
for study group was estimated from a proportional hazards model that also accounted for 
competing risks. Infection rates were calculated as the number of patients who experienced 
each infection at least one time during their observation period, and Fisher’s exact tests were 
used to test for differences between groups. To account for multiple infections in an 
individual patient as well as differing periods of risk, infection densities were calculated as 
the total number of infections per patient per days at risk. Individual patient infection 
densities were then averaged over all patients in a group to calculate the mean number of 
infections experienced per 100 patient days, and Wilcoxon rank-sum tests were used to test 
for differences between groups. Poisson regression was used to estimate the effect of NiCord 
versus standard UCB transplantation on the rates of total infection, grade 2–3 infection, 
bacterial infection, grade 2–3 bacterial infection, and grade 2–3 non-viral infection, both 
univariately and after adjustment for covariates known to affect the risk of infection 
including age, disease status, and acute GVHD.16 An offset was included in the model to 
account for the observation time for each patient. Risk ratios (RR) and 95% CI were 
estimated from the Poisson model. Analysis of variance (ANOVA) was used to univariately 
examine the association of time alive and out of the hospital during the first 100 days post-

 transplant with study group, and analysis of covariance (ANCOVA) was used to examine the 
association after adjustment for known covariates including age and Karnofsky performance 
status (KPS). To determine if the standard UCB patients transplanted from 2010–2015 
(n=50) were different than the full group of control patients, a sensitivity analysis comparing 
these two groups was conducted. A second sensitivity analysis was performed by comparing 
the NiCord cohort to the contemporaneous cohort of standard UCB patients transplanted 
from 2010–2015. All statistical analyses were conducted with SAS version 9.4 (Cary, NC). 
This retrospective analysis was approved by the Duke University Medical Center 
Institutional Review Board.
Results
Patients
A total of 104 patients were included in this study; 18 underwent NiCord transplantation and 
86 underwent standard UCB transplantation. Patient baseline and transplant characteristics 
are summarized in Table 1. NiCord recipients were older (median age 45.5, IQR 42–57 
years) than standard UCB recipients (median age 37.5, IQR 28–51 years; p=0.007). Patient 
sex, pre-transplant weight, CMV serostatus, and KPS were similar between groups. The 
underlying malignant disease (acute leukemia/MDS 89%, lymphoid 11%) and disease status 
at transplant in each group were also similar. All patients received a myeloablative total 
body irradiation (TBI) and fludarabine-based conditioning regimen, and no patients received 
in vivo T cell depletion. In the NiCord group, 11 patients received NiCord with a second 
unmanipulated unit and 7 patients (39%) received NiCord as a single UCB graft, while only 
4 patients (5%, p<0.001) in the standard UCB group underwent single UCB transplantation. 
There was a range of recipient to UCB unit HLA matching in both groups and cryopreserved 
total nucleated cell dose was similar. No significant differences between the groups were 
observed in grade II–IV acute GVHD, second transplant, disease relapse, or death in the first 
100 days after transplantation.
Neutrophil Engraftment
Median time to neutrophil engraftment in NiCord patients was 12.5 days (95% CI 10–18), 
significantly faster than 26 days (95% CI 22–28) in standard UCB patients (HR 3.68, 95% 
CI 1.74–7.77; p<0.001)(Figure 1). In the NiCord group, one patient (6%) had engraftment 
failure after double UCB transplantation. In the standard UCB group, 10 of 86 patients 
(12%; p=0.68) had engraftment failure with 2 patients after single and 8 patients after double 
UCB transplantation.
Total Infections
A total of 343 infection episodes were identified in the study population with 58 in the 
NiCord group and 285 in the standard UCB transplantation group. The distribution of total 
infections by type was 107 bacterial, 157 viral, 10 fungal and 69 non-microbiologically 
defined infections (Table 2). By severity, 208 infections were grade 1, 99 infections were 
grade 2, and 36 infections were grade 3. All 18 NiCord and 86 standard UCB patients had at 
least one infection of any severity. Ten of 18 (56%) NiCord and 63 of 86 (73%) standard 
UCB patients had at least one grade 2–3 (moderate to severe) infection (p=0.16). Pathogen-

 specific comparison of grade 2–3 infection in NiCord versus standard UCB recipients 
showed significantly lower frequency of at least one bacterial infection, 22% vs. 57% 
(p=0.009) respectively, but no difference in frequency of at least one grade 2–3 viral (44% 
vs. 36%, p=0.59) or fungal (0% vs. 5%, p=1.0) infection. There was a strong trend toward 
reduction in non-microbiologically defined grade 2–3 infections (0% vs. 19%, p=0.07), 
however this did not reach significance, likely due to the small sample size.
Infection Density
The mean number of total infections during the first 100 days following transplantation was 
3.7 per patient in the NiCord group and 4.9 per patient in the standard UCB transplantation 
group (p=0.09, Figure 2a). Grade 2–3 infection was decreased in the NiCord group at 0.9/
patient versus 2.5/patient in the standard UCB group (p=0.01). On further pathogen-specific 
analysis of this difference, grade 2–3 bacterial infection was significantly lower in the 
NiCord group at 0.3/patient versus 1.5/patient in the standard UCB group (p=0.007, Figure 
2b), while there was no difference in grade 2–3 viral infection at 0.6/patient in both groups 
(p=0.7, Figure 2c). There were a low number of grade 2–3 fungal (0.1/patient) and non-
microbiologically defined (0.4/patient) infections observed in the standard UCB group but 
none in the NiCord group. Total bacterial infection was also decreased in the NiCord group 
at 0.7/patient compared to 2.0/patient in the standard UCB group (p=0.01), largely due to the 
decrease in grade 2–3 bacterial infection (Figure 2b).
By Poisson regression analysis, recipients of NiCord versus standard UCB transplantation 
had significantly reduced risk for total infection (0.69, 95% CI 0.52–0.91; p=0.01), grade 2–
3 infection (0.36, 95% CI 0.19–0.62; p<0.001), bacterial infection (0.39, 95% CI 0.2–0.69; 
p=0.003), and grade 2–3 bacterial infection (0.21, 95% CI 0.06–0.51; p=0.003)(Table 3). 
This effect was largely unchanged after multivariate adjustment for age, disease stage, and 
grade II–IV acute GVHD (Figure 3).
Unexpectedly, grade II–IV acute GVHD was also associated with a decreased risk of 
infection in the multivariate models. Further analysis of this observation revealed that a 
significantly higher proportion of patients without grade II–IV acute GVHD required second 
transplant (19% vs. 0%; p=0.001), increasing risk of infection in this group compared to 
patients with acute grade II–IV GVHD.
Hospitalization
NiCord recipients spent an unadjusted mean of 72.4 days (95% CI 61.6–83.2) out of the 
hospital in the first 100 days, significantly longer than 48.6 days (95% CI 42.3–54.9) in the 
standard UCB transplantation group (p=0.001; Figure 4). After adjustment for age and KPS, 
recipients of NiCord had on average 20.2 (95% CI 6.0–34.3) more days out of the hospital 
compared to standard UCB recipients (p=0.005; Table 4), resulting in an adjusted mean of 
69.9 days (95% CI 57.1–82.7) out of the hospital in the NiCord group versus 49.7 days 
(95% CI 44.0–55.5) in the standard UCB transplantation group. KPS was independently 
associated with more time out of the hospital in the first 100 days, on average 6.0 more days 
per 10 point increase in KPS (95% CI 0.2–11.9; p=0.04). However, after adjustment, 
increasing age had no impact on length of hospitalization.

 Discussion
Delayed hematopoietic recovery remains a major limitation of umbilical cord blood 
transplantation. Several methods for ex vivo expansion of UCB units before transplantation 
have resulted in improved time to neutrophil engraftment, but the impact on clinically 
relevant early outcomes has not been evaluated. As previously reported in the Phase 1 trial 
of NiCord transplantation, we found that transplantation of the ex vivo expanded NiCord 
graft in an enlarged cohort was associated with rapid hematopoietic recovery compared to a 
historical cohort of patients undergoing standard UCB transplantation. In this study, we 
show that early hematopoietic recovery in NiCord recipients translates into a decreased 
burden of infectious complications and hospitalization in the first 100 days after 
transplantation.
A recent analysis of infectious complications from the randomized BMT CTN 0201 study 
comparing bone marrow to peripheral blood stem cells from unrelated donors showed a 
higher cumulative incidence of infection before engraftment and bacterial bloodstream 
infection during the first 100 days in the bone marrow group, which also had a 5 day longer 
median time to neutrophil engraftment.17, 18 Several prior studies have reported a higher 
incidence of bacterial and fungal infections during the post-transplantation period in UCB 
transplantation recipients compared to other unrelated donor sources.4, 19–21 A large registry 
analysis of UCB transplantation identified an association between early bacterial infection 
and increased risk of overall mortality, although another analysis comparing overall 
infection related mortality between UCB and other unrelated donor sources did not identify 
a significant difference.4, 22 Regardless, decreasing morbidity and resource utilization 
associated with early infectious complications is a clinically relevant outcome.
In the current study, we identified an early bacterial infection rate of 2.0 per patient during 
the first 100 days in the standard UCB group, which is similar to the previously reported rate 
of 2.1 bacterial infections per patient in the first 100 days after UCB transplantation by 
Parody and colleagues, recognizing that there are some subtle differences in the method of 
categorizing infections.4 By contrast, in the NiCord transplantation group, the rate of early 
bacterial infection was significantly decreased to 0.68 infections per patient, and this effect 
remained unchanged after adjusting for age, disease stage, and acute GVHD. Similarly, 
clinically significant grade 2–3 total and bacterial infection rates were also lower in the 
NiCord group compared to the standard UCB group in our analysis. The difference in 
moderate to severe bacterial infection was largely due to a decrease in bloodstream infection 
in the NiCord group, which may be a function of earlier neutrophil recovery. Bloodstream 
infection is the most common infection after allogeneic transplantation and has been 
associated with increased mortality.23 In addition, antibiotic use that accompanies these 
infections may have a negative impact on intestinal bacterial flora. Recent studies have 
shown that broad spectrum antibiotic therapy can alter the intestinal microbiome, and low 
microbial diversity has been associated with increased acute GVHD and mortality after 
transplantation24–26. Therefore, the benefits of early engraftment may extend beyond 
reduction in the morbidity and mortality associated with bloodstream infections.

 Conversely, there was no difference between the NiCord and standard UCB group in the rate 
of viral infection, which would not necessarily be expected with earlier hematologic 
recovery. The paradoxical protective effect of grade II–IV acute GVHD in our multivariate 
model was likely related to the significantly higher proportion of patients without acute 
grade II–IV GVHD who experienced primary graft failure and subsequently requiring a 
second rescue transplant. This resulted in an increased risk of infectious complications due 
to prolonged neutropenia.
A recent registry analysis comparing hospitalization between unrelated donor graft sources 
showed that double UCB recipients had a median of 55 days alive and out of the hospital in 
the first 100 days after transplantation, significantly shorter than median 75 days for 
peripheral blood stem cell graft recipients.5 In our study, NiCord recipients had an adjusted 
mean of 69.9 days alive and out of the hospital in the first 100 days, significantly longer than 
49.7 days in the standard UCB transplantation group.
It is tempting to speculate that faster neutrophil engraftment and decreased infectious 
complications may be contributing to the improvement in time out of the hospital in the 
NiCord group. Limitations of this study include the small sample size in the NiCord group 
and the inherent inability to control for all potential confounding factors in a retrospective 
analysis. However, since all the included patients were treated at a single institution, there is 
a lower risk of unaccounted differences in supportive care. In order to evaluate the potential 
impact of changes in supportive care over time, we performed a sensitivity analysis 
comparing NiCord patients to a contemporaneous cohort of standard UCB patients 
transplanted from 2010–2015, which did not differ from the primary analysis of infection 
density or hospitalization. The current analysis included detailed infection data that is 
generally not available in a larger registry based study. Larger studies will be required to 
determine if improved early clinical outcomes after NiCord transplantation compared to 
standard UCB recipients will translate into improved overall patient outcomes.
In conclusion, transplantation of NiCord was associated with faster neutrophil engraftment, 
reduced total and bacterial infections, and shorter hospitalization in the first 100 days after 
transplantation compared to standard UCB transplantation. Our results confirm that rapid 
hematopoietic recovery from an ex vivo expanded UCB transplantation approach is 
associated with early clinical benefit.
