ABSTRACT
ObjeCtive
To quantify the dose-response associations between 
total physical activity and risk of breast cancer, colon 
cancer, diabetes, ischemic heart disease, and 
ischemic stroke events.
Design
Systematic review and Bayesian dose-response 
meta-analysis.
Data sOurCes
PubMed and Embase from 1980 to 27 February 2016, 
and references from relevant systematic reviews. Data 
from the Study on Global AGEing and Adult Health 
conducted in China, Ghana, India, Mexico, Russia, and 
South Africa from 2007 to 2010 and the US National 
Health and Nutrition Examination Surveys from 1999 to 
2011 were used to map domain specific physical 
activity (reported in included studies) to total activity.
eligibility Criteria fOr seleCting stuDies
Prospective cohort studies examining the associations 
between physical activity (any domain) and at least 
one of the five diseases studied.
results
174 articles were identified: 35 for breast cancer, 19 
for colon cancer, 55 for diabetes, 43 for ischemic 
heart disease, and 26 for ischemic stroke (some 
articles included multiple outcomes). Although 
higher levels of total physical activity were 
significantly associated with lower risk for all 
outcomes, major gains occurred at lower levels of 
activity (up to 3000-4000 metabolic equivalent (MET) 
minutes/week). For example, individuals with a total 
activity level of 600 MET minutes/week (the minimum 
recommended level) had a 2% lower risk of diabetes 
compared with those reporting no physical activity. 
An increase from 600 to 3600 MET minutes/week 
reduced the risk by an additional 19%. The same 
amount of increase yielded much smaller returns at 
higher levels of activity: an increase of total activity 
from 9000 to 12 000 MET minutes/week reduced the 
risk of diabetes by only 0.6%. Compared with 
insufficiently active individuals (total activity <600 
MET minutes/week), the risk reduction for those in 
the highly active category (≥8000 MET minutes/
week) was 14% (relative risk 0.863, 95% uncertainty 
interval 0.829 to 0.900) for breast cancer; 21% 
(0.789, 0.735 to 0.850) for colon cancer; 28% (0.722, 
0.678 to 0.768) for diabetes; 25% (0.754, 0.704 to 
0.809) for ischemic heart disease; and 26% (0.736, 
0.659 to 0.811) for ischemic stroke.
COnClusiOns
People who achieve total physical activity levels 
several times higher than the current recommended 
minimum level have a significant reduction in the risk 
of the five diseases studied. More studies with 
detailed quantification of total physical activity will 
help to find more precise relative risk estimates for 
different levels of activity.
Introduction
Although the protective effect of physical activity on 
various chronic diseases is well studied and sup-
ported in the literature, relatively few studies have 
systematically quantified the dose-response relations 
between physical activity and chronic disease end-
points. Systematic reviews that examined the dose-re-
sponse associations between physical activity and 
breast cancer,1  diabetes,2  ischemic heart disease,3  or 
any cancer4  focused mainly on a single domain such 
as leisure time physical activity.1-4  As leisure time 
WhAT IS AlReAdy knoWn on ThIS TopIC
Many cohort studies and meta-analyses have shown the health benefits of physical 
activity, resulting in WHO recommending a minimum total physical activity level 
(irrespective of domains including leisure time, household, occupation, and/or 
transportation) of 600 MET minutes a week, but the upper limit of total activity 
required is not known
Meta-analyses that examined the dose-response associations between physical 
activity and chronic diseases focused mainly on a single domain of activity such as 
leisure time physical activity, which constitutes a relatively small part of total daily 
activity, and thus the relation between total physical activity and chronic diseases 
has not been well characterized
WhAT ThIS STudy AddS
This dose-response meta-analysis focused on total physical activity across different 
domains of life (leisure time, occupation, domestic, transportation) and included 
about three to five times more prospective cohort studies than previous dose-
response meta-analyses that focused on a single domain of activity only
The continuous risk curves for the associations between total physical activity and 
breast cancer, colon cancer, diabetes, ischemic heart disease, and ischemic stroke 
show that although the risks of these diseases decrease with increasing level of 
total activity, most health gains occur at relatively lower levels of activity (up to 
3000-4000 MET minutes/week), with diminishing returns at higher levels of activity

activity constitutes a relatively small part of total daily 
activity,5-8  it does not provide an overall picture of 
physical activity. Physical activity in any domain (rec-
reation, transportation, household chores, and/or 
occupation) is beneficial for health and recommended 
by the World Health  
Organization.9  Moreover, consid-
eration of only a single domain ignores the activity 
undertaken in other domains, which could result in 
biased estimates.10
Whereas it is important to assess total physical 
activity and its dose-response association with health 
outcomes, there are several challenges to accomplish 
this. The measurement and classification of physical 
activity in individual studies are heterogeneous. There 
is a lack of consistency across studies in terms of the 
domains being assessed (recreational, household, 
transport related, occupational, or total activity) and 
the metric of measurement (for example, quantitative 
metric such as hours a week and qualitative metric 
such as inactive versus highly active). The categoriza-
tion of activity levels also varies widely across studies. 
As a result, most meta-analyses did not assess dose- 
response associations but compared only the least 
active with the most active individuals. A limitation 
of this approach is that being the most active in recre-
ational activities might not be comparable with being 
the most active in  
occupational activities, indicating 
a need for standardization of physical activity across 
studies.
WHO recommends at least 600 metabolic equiva-
lent (MET) minutes of total activity (irrespective of 
domains) per week for health benefits; this would be, 
for example, about 150 minutes/week of brisk walking 
or 75 minutes/week of running.11  Despite the well 
established causal relations between physical activity 
and chronic diseases, including breast cancer, colon 
cancer, diabetes, ischemic heart disease, and ischemic 
stroke,10 12 13 knowledge is limited as to how much the 
risk decreases with an increase in the amount of total 
activity. To date, no study has quanitified, in a dose- 
response fashion, the amount of total physical activity 
required to lower the risk of these diseases using all 
available data sources. We conducted a systematic 
review to estimate the association between total phys-
ical activity, standardized as a continuous scale (MET 
minutes/week) and the five outcomes (breast cancer, 
colon cancer, diabetes, ischemic heart disease, and 
ischemic stroke) for the Global Burden of Disease 
(GBD) 2013 study.
Methods
literature search
We conducted this systematic review following PRISMA 
and MOOSE guidelines.14 
15 This review was performed 
following the methods documented in a systematic 
review protocol (appendix 1). We searched PubMed and 
Embase from 1980 to 30 September 2014 and updated 
the search up to 27 February 2016 for studies that exam-
ined the association between physical activity and the 
risks of one of the five outcomes (breast cancer, colon 
cancer, diabetes, ischemic heart disease, ischemic 
stroke). We restricted the search to English language 
publications and studies in humans. Appendix 2 shows 
the search strategies. We also reviewed the reference list 
of included studies in previous systematic reviews of 
these outcomes.
study selection
Prospective cohort studies that assessed physical activ-
ity as the exposure variable (total activity or domain 
specific activity that allowed conversion to total activ-
ity) and at least one of the five chosen diseases as an 
outcome and provided risk estimates (relative risk, 
hazard ratio, or odds ratio) with confidence intervals or 
standard errors (or sufficient data to calculate them) 
were eligible for inclusion. Disagreements on eligibility 
were resolved by consensus. We included only prospec-
tive cohort studies to minimize recall and selection 
biases that are common in case-control studies. For 
studies that categorized physical activity qualitatively, 
they also had to report number of individuals or person 
years in each activity category. If multiple studies 
reported on the same dataset and study period, we 
included the one with a more detailed report of physi-
cal activity and better control of confounding vari-
ables. We considered the following variables to be the 
main potential confounders: age (all outcomes), sex 
(ischemic heart disease and ischemic stroke), family 
history of the outcome of interest (all outcomes), estro-
gen and progesterone exposure (breast cancer), and 
lifestyle factors (all outcomes).
Data extraction
Four authors (VB, MM, JEM, and HHK) independently 
extracted data using a standardized data extraction 
form. HHK and LTA independently checked the data. 
The following variables were extracted from each 
included study: author, year of publication, study loca-
tion, duration of follow-up, sex, age at baseline, type of 
physical activity (leisure time/recreational, domestic, 
occupational and/or transport related activity), mea-
surement method of physical activity, category, dura-
tion, frequency and/or intensity of physical activity, 
dose of physical activity (for example, minutes a week, 
MET hours/week), sample size, response rate, number 
of cases and participants in each category, and risk esti-
mates with corresponding confidence intervals (age/sex 
adjusted and multivariate adjusted) for each activity 
category.
assessment of quality of included studies
We used the Newcastle-Ottawa scale (NOS)16 to assess 
the quality of included studies in representativeness 
of the cohort, whether the non-exposed participants 
were drawn from the same population as the 
exposed, ascertainment of exposure, whether the 
outcome of interest was absent at the start of study, 
comparability of the exposed and unexposed (that is, 
adjustment for potential confounding variables), 
ascertainment of the outcome, whether the length of 
the follow-up was long enough (at least five years) for 
the outcome to occur, and the completeness of the

follow-up (loss to follow-up <20%). A maximum 
score of 2 can be awarded for comparability and a 
maximum score of 1 can be given for each of the 
remaining items. A study can have a maximum possi-
ble quality score of 9.
Preparation of data for dose-response 
meta-analysis
In preparation for the dose-response meta-analysis, 
we standardized domain specific physical activity 
 
measures  
to total MET minutes of activity a week. 
Domain specific physical activity measures refer to 
the activity undertaken in different domains of life 
(for example, activity in the domain of leisure time, 
activity in the domain of work, and activity in the 
domain of transportation). MET represents the ratio 
of the working metabolic rate to the resting metabolic 
rate. One MET is defined as the amount of oxygen con-
sumed while a person is sitting quietly and is about 
3.5 mL O2/kg body weight/min.17  To map domain spe-
cific activity to total activity, we carried out log-log 
ordinary least squares regression to determine the 
association between total and domain specific activi-
ties using data from the Study on Global Ageing and 
Adult Health (SAGE) conducted in six countries 
(China, Ghana, India, Mexico, Russia, and South 
Africa) from 2007 to 2010 and additional data from 
the US National Health and Nutrition Examination 
Surveys (NHANES) from 1999 to 2011.18-30  Both SAGE 
and NHANES are nationally  
representative surveys 
that measured activity in recreation, transportation, 
and occupation separately with the Global Physical 
Activity Questionnaire (GPAQ), allowing mapping 
from domain specific metrics to total activity across 
all domains. As domestic physical activity is not 
explicitly captured in these surveys, we applied a cor-
rection factor for domestic activity for women in 
developing countries, for whom we found signifi-
cantly lower activity levels when assessed with the 
GPAQ compared with the International Physical Activ-
ity Questionnaire (IPAQ), which captured all activity 
(including domestic activity). We did not adjust for 
domestic activity for men and women in developed 
countries and for men in developing countries as we 
did not find any significant difference in the total 
activity level between surveys that used the GPAQ and 
those that used the IPAQ. The regression coefficients 
were applied to the MET minutes/week cut offs for the 
domain specific activity categories in included stud-
ies that reported MET minutes/week or were con-
verted directly to MET minutes/week, resulting in 
estimated total weekly activity for each relative risk 
level. For studies that measured physical activity 
quantitatively, but not in METs, we calculated MET 
minutes/week based on the reported duration and 
intensity of activity, assigning 4 METs to the time 
spent in moderate intensity activities and 8 METs to 
vigorous activities, as suggested by WHO.11
For studies that assessed physical activity qualita-
tively (such as low, moderate, and high) with no 
additional information on duration and intensity of 
activity, we calculated the centiles of the activity 
 
distribution and mapped them to the GBD 2013 expo-
sure  
distribution in MET minutes/week (which are 
specific for country, year, age, and sex) to generate 
estimates of total physical activity. More specifically, 
we assigned a centile cut off to each reported activity 
category based on the percentage of the study popu-
lation falling into that activity category. A centile 
value was also assigned to each of the GBD 2013 MET 
minute cut points (600, 3999, and 8000 MET min-
utes/week) based on the GBD 2013 estimated expo-
sure distributions. The method used to estimate 
physical activity exposure in GBD 2013 has been 
reported in detail elsewhere.13 Within each activity 
category, exposure was assumed to be uniformly dis-
tributed. Centiles from the studies were mapped to 
those assigned to the GBD 2013 distribution of physi-
cal activity exposure, and the corresponding MET 
minute value was assigned as the cut off for each 
 
category reported by a study.
Data analysis
We used Dismod-MR 2.0,31 GBD’s bayesian meta- 
regression tool, to pool effect sizes from included 
studies and generate a dose-response total physical 
activity curve for each of the five outcomes. The tool 
enabled us to incorporate random effects across stud-
ies and include data with different activity ranges and 
variation in categorization across studies. The equa-
tions and explanations are presented in appendix 3. 
The dose-response meta-analysis/meta-regression 
was run separately for each of the five outcomes. We 
included study covariates indicating whether or not 
the MET minutes were estimated with the GBD 2013 
exposure data; whether a study reported relative risk, 
odds ratio, or hazard ratio; and a sex covariate (men, 
women, or both sexes) (sex was not included as a 
covariate in the meta-analysis for breast cancer as we 
focused only on breast cancer among women). For 
ischemic stroke, because the number of studies iden-
tified was small (n=13), we also included 13 studies 
that reported the association between physical activ-
ity and total stroke and included a study level covari-
ate indicating whether the outcome was ischemic 
stroke or total stroke. Ischemic stroke was set as the 
reference category, which allowed Dismod-MR2 
to adjust the relative risk for total stroke to the refer-
ence level.
Publication bias
Publication bias was assessed with funnel plots and the 
Egger test.32  To assess the influence of any possible 
publication bias we used sensitivity analyses with the 
trim and fill method, which identifies potentially miss-
ing studies and corrects for funnel plot asymmetry.33
sensitivity analysis
We assessed the impact of the quality of studies on 
the findings by sensitivity analyses including only 
higher quality studies. To evaluate the influence 
of imprecise measurement of exposure, we also

conducted  
sensitivity analyses separately for studies 
that measured physical activity quantitatively and 
those that assessed it qualitatively, for which 
MET minutes were estimated with the GBD 2013 expo-
sure data.
Patient involvement
No patients were involved in setting the research ques-
tion or the outcome measures, nor were they involved in 
developing plans for design or implementation of the 
study. No patients were asked to advise on interpreta-
tion or writing up of results. There are no plans to dis-
seminate the results of the research to study participants 
or the relevant patient community.
Results
Our literature search identified a total of 11 166 citations 
(fig 1). After removal of the duplicate citations, 6965 
studies remained for title and abstract screening, of 
which 223 articles were potentially relevant for full text 
review. We excluded 26 articles that used the same data-
set as other included studies. An additional 23 articles 
with insufficient data (such as lack of information on 
the number of individuals or person years in each activ-
ity category, which was needed to convert from qualita-
tive activity levels to METs) were also excluded. This left 
a total of 174 studies (149 184 285 total person years of 
follow-up) to include in our bayesian dose-response 
meta-analysis: 35 studies for breast cancer (50 949 108 
person years), 19 for colon cancer (53 929 648 person 
years), 55 for diabetes (14 051 132 person years), 43 for 
ischemic heart disease (16 583 824 person years), and 26 
for ischemic stroke (13 670 573 person years) (the 
 
number of included studies for each outcome does not 
sum up to 174 because some studies included multiple 
outcomes). Characteristics of included studies for each 
outcome are shown in the tables A-E in appendix 4.
Continuous dose-response relations
The continuous risk curves for each of the five outcomes 
are shown in figures 2-6 . Higher levels of total physical 
activity were associated with lower risk of all outcomes. 
Major gains occurred at lower levels of activity, and the 
decrease in risk was minimal at levels higher than 
3000-4000 MET minutes/week. (A person can achieve 
3000 MET minutes/week by incorporating different 
types of physical activity into the daily routine—for 
example, climbing stairs 10 minutes, vacuuming 15 
minutes, gardening 20 minutes, running 20 minutes, 
and walking or cycling for transportation 25 minutes on 
a daily basis would together achieve about 3000 MET 
minutes a week). This pattern was most prominent for 
ischemic heart disease and diabetes and least promi-
nent for breast cancer (fig 7; table F in appendix 4). For 
example, individuals with a total activity level of 600 
MET minutes/week (the minimum level recommended 
by WHO) had a 2% lower risk of diabetes compared with 
those reporting no physical activity. An increase from 
600 to 3600 MET minutes/week reduced the risk by an 
additional 19%. The same amount of increase yielded 
much smaller returns at higher levels of activity: an 
increase of total activity from 9000 to 12 000 MET min-
utes/week reduced the risk of diabetes by only 0.6% 
(table F in appendix 4). The corresponding risk reduc-
tion for breast cancer was 1% for an increase in total 
physical activity from 0 to 600 MET minutes/week (not 
significant), an additional 4% reduction in risk for an

increase from 600 to 3600 MET minutes/week, and a 2% 
reduction in risk for an increase in total activity from 9000 
to 12 000 MET minutes/week (table F in appendix 4).
Categorical dose-response relations
Table 1 shows the relative risks and uncertainty inter-
vals for the associations between physical activity and 
the five outcomes (uncertainty intervals are a range of 
values that are likely to include the correct risk estimate 
for the association between physical activity and each 
health outcome).
Compared with insufficiently active women 
(reporting less than 600 MET minutes/week of total 
physical activity), the risk of breast cancer among 
those in the low active (600-3999 MET minutes), 
moderately active (4000-7999 MET minutes), and 
highly active (≥8000 MET minutes) categories was 
reduced by 3%, 6%, and 14%, respectively. Compared 
with insufficiently active individuals (both men and 
women), the risk of colon cancer among those in the 
low active, moderately active, and highly active cate-
gories was reduced by 10%, 17%, and 21%, respec-
tively. The corresponding reductions in risk were 
14%, 25%, and 28% for diabetes, 16%, 23%, and 25% 
for ischemic heart disease, and 16%, 19%, and 26% 
for ischemic stroke, respectively.
assessment of risk of bias and publication bias
Tables A-E in appendix 4 show the quality assessment 
scores for each study. The scores varied from a maxi-
mum of 9 to a minimum of 3. Sensitivity analyses in 
which we excluded studies with a score <7 showed sim-
ilar results, except for diabetes (table 2 ). The strength of 
association between total physical activity and diabetes 
was weaker for moderately active and highly active cat-
egories when we restricted the analysis to higher qual-
ity studies (table 2).
The study covariate indicating whether or not the 
MET minutes were estimated with the GBD 2013 expo-
sure data was not significant for all outcomes except 
for breast cancer. Sensitivity analyses for breast cancer 
studies did not show a significant difference between 
those that assessed physical activity quantitatively and 
those that assessed it qualitatively, though the latter 
tended to show slightly stronger associations (table G, 
appendix 4).
Egger’s test27 for publication bias was significant 
(P<0.05) for diabetes, ischemic heart disease, and 
 
ischemic stroke. Sensitivity analyses in which we 
included the missing studies identified through the trim 
and fill method showed similar results (data not 
shown). There was no significant evidence of publica-
tion bias for breast cancer and colon cancer.
discussion
This is the first meta-analysis to quantify the dose-re-
sponse association between total physical activity 
across all domains and the risk of five chronic diseases. 
Using data from 174 cohort studies, we estimated rela-
tive risks of diseases for each dose of total physical 
activity in MET minutes/week. The results of our 
meta-analysis showed that higher levels of total physi-
cal activity were significantly associated with lower risk 
for all outcomes: major gains occurred at lower levels of 
activity and there were diminishing returns at levels 
higher than 3000-4000 MET minutes/week. There was 
no evidence that the findings differed between studies 
with a higher or lower risk of bias for activity levels 
where most health gains occurred.
Comparison with previous work
The findings of this study extend previous meta-analy-
ses in several important ways. First, this study included 
a lot more studies than previous quantitative dose-re-
sponse meta-analyses. For example, we included 55, 35, 
and 43 cohort studies on diabetes, breast cancer, and 
ischemic heart disease, respectively, in our study com-
pared with 16 studies on diabetes,2  13 studies on breast 
cancer,1  and nine studies on ischemic heart disease3 
 
included in previous dose-response meta-analyses. No 
studies have systematically quantified the dose-re-
sponse associations between physical activity and the 
remaining outcomes (colon cancer and ischemic

stroke). Second, in contrast with previous dose- 
response meta-analyses that focused on a single 
domain, such as leisure time activity,1 
3 
4 we quantified 
total physical activity across all domains and thus pro-
vide an overall picture. The quantification of total activ-
ity was made possible by the use of nationally 
representative surveys, including SAGE and NHANES, 
that cover activity in different domains, making it pos-
sible to map domain specific activity to total activity. 
Third, the use of Dismod-MR 2.0, GBD’s bayesian 
meta-regression tool, enabled us to include data with 
different activity ranges and variation in categorization 
across studies. This has not been possible previously, 
and, as a result, most meta-analyses provided pooled 
estimates  
comparing the most active with the least 
active individuals. As being most active in recreational 
activities might not be comparable with being the most 
active in occupational activities, this makes it difficult 
to interpret the resulting pooled estimates. In the pres-
ent study, we enhanced the comparability across stud-
ies by standardizing different measures of physical 
activity into total activity in MET minutes/week.
Of the previous meta-analyses examining the 
dose-response associations of leisure time physical 
activity with breast cancer,1  diabetes,2  and ischemic 
heart disease,3 the breast cancer study reported a linear 
association whereas the latter two found smaller 
returns at higher levels of activity. Consistent with the 
latter studies, we found diminishing returns at higher 
levels of total physical activity for diabetes and isch-
emic heart disease. We also found a similar pattern of 
associations for breast cancer, colon cancer, and isch-
emic stroke.
implications of findings
Our findings have several important implications. They 
suggest that total physical activity needs to be several 
times higher than the current recommended minimum 
level of 600 MET minutes/week to achieve larger reduc-
tions in risks of breast cancer, colon cancer, diabetes, 
ischemic heart disease, and ischemic stroke. Focusing 
on a particular domain such as leisure time physical 
activity, which represents only a small fraction of total 
activity, as was done by most studies, restricts the scope 
of applicability of the findings in the real world by lim-
iting the opportunity of increasing activity in different 
domains in daily life (such as being more physically 
active at work, engaging more in domestic activities 
such as housework and gardening, and/or engaging in 
active transportation such as walking and cycling). Tak-
ing into account all domains of physical activity 
increases opportunities for promoting physical activity. 
Further work with studies with more detailed quantifi-
cation of total physical activity is warranted to provide 
more precise estimates for different levels of physical 
activity. Finally, the methodological innovation of this 
study could be applicable to other systematic reviews 
(in different specialties) meta-analyzing studies with 
variation in categorizations of exposure.
strengths and limitations of the study
Our study included much larger data coverage than pre-
vious dose response meta-analyses on breast cancer, 
diabetes, and ischemic heart disease. It is the first to 
examine the dose-response associations between phys-
ical activity and colon cancer and ischemic stroke. 
Other strengths included the quantification of total 
physical activity instead of restricting it to a single 
domain of activity, the enhancement of comparability 
across studies through standardization of the measure 
of physical activity, and the ability to include data with 
various categorizations of physical activity while incor-
porating random effects across studies.
It does, however, have some limitations. First, we 
might have missed articles as a result of restricting our 
search to two databases and studies published in 
English. Previous systematic reviews without language 
restrictions found none or few non-English studies.1 2 
 
Available evidence34  suggests that a combination 
of Embase and Medline (a subset of the PubMed 
 
database)35 yields a coverage of 97.5%. In addition to 
searching Embase and PubMed, we manually searched 
the reference list of relevant articles so we believe that 
the percentage of missing studies is likely to be small 
and have little impact on the findings. Second, the 
effect of physical activity on the outcomes might be 
influenced by unmeasured factors and/or effect modi-
fiers. Because our analysis relied on the data reported 
by cohort studies, we could not account for the poten-
tial for residual confounding or effect modification. 
Third, results of the test of publication bias were signif-
icant for diabetes, ischemic heart disease, and isch-
emic stroke. The inclusion of potentially missing 
studies (imputed based on funnel plot asymmetry) in 
our sensitivity analyses, however, showed similar 
results. Fourth, the dose-response meta-analysis 
included studies that measured physical activity qual-
itatively, which were mapped to the GBD 2013 exposure 
distribution to generate estimates of total physical 
activity. This imprecise measurement of exposure

could lead to regression dilution bias, resulting in 
underestimation of the relative risks. Sensitivity analy-
ses, however, showed no significant difference in the 
pooled relative risks between studies that used quanti-
tative versus qualitative exposure metrics. Fifth, we 
focused on volume (a combination of intensity, fre-
quency, and duration) because of its wide use in prac-
tice and the availability of the data. This ignores the 
role that intensity plays in the dose of physical activity. 
Future investigations could extend our findings by 
examining the impact of different intensity composi-
tions of total physical activity on risks of disease. Sixth, 
in this study, we calculated pooled relative risks for the 
associations between different doses of total physical 
activity and five chronic diseases. Although it would be 
ideal to provide both relative and absolute risk reduc-
tion to portray a more complete  
picture, many included 
studies reported only relative risks and did not provide 
the risk of events in the exposed and unexposed groups 
separately or the information to calculate them to com-
pute the absolute risk. Seventh, there could be changes 
in MET hours/week over time. As we relied on the phys-
ical activity reported by studies, we did not have sup-
plementary data to correct for that. Eighth, we used 
NHANES and SAGE surveys to map from domain spe-
cific metrics to total activity across all domains. These 
surveys did not capture European countries (other than 
Russia). Physical activity patterns might vary across 
locations, even among developed countries, and our 
mapping might be less precise for countries that were 
not included in NHANES and SAGE surveys. Finally, we 
chose the upper bound of the highest activity category 
based on the 99th centile of population based micro-
data, which is large and could cause underestimation 
of the effect size for that category, but the continuous 
risk curves reached a plateau at lower levels of activity, 
 
suggesting that shifting studies to the left would not 
make a big difference.
Conclusions
In conclusion, the findings of this study showed that a 
higher level of total physical activity is strongly associ-
ated with a lower risk of breast cancer, colon cancer, 
diabetes, ischemic heart disease, and ischemic stroke, 
with most health gains occurring at a total activity level 
of 3000-4000 MET minutes/week. Results suggest that 
total physical activity needs to be several times higher 
than the recommended minimum level of 600 MET min-
utes/week for larger reductions in the risk of these dis-
eases. With population ageing, and an increasing 
number of cardiovascular and diabetes deaths since 
1990,36 greater attention and investments in interven-
tions to promote physical activity in the general public 
is required. More studies using the detailed quantifica-
tion of total physical activity will help to find a more 
precise estimate for different levels of physical activity.
