Abstract
IMPORTANCE—Management of acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) remains largely 
supportive. Whether early intervention can prevent development of ARDS remains unclear.
OBJECTIVE—To evaluate the efficacy and safety of early aspirin administration for the 
prevention of ARDS.
DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS—A multicenter, double-blind, placebo-controlled, 
randomized clinical trial conducted at 16 US academic hospitals. Between January 2, 2012, and 
November 17, 2014, 7673 patients at risk for ARDS (Lung Injury Prediction Score≥4) in the 
emergency department were screened and 400 were randomized. Ten patients were excluded, 
leaving 390 in the final modified intention-to-treat analysis cohort.

 INTERVENTIONS—Administration of aspirin, 325-mg loading dose followed by 81mg/d (n = 
195) or placebo (n = 195) within 24 hours of emergency department presentation and continued to 
hospital day 7, discharge, or death.
MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES—The primary outcome was the development of ARDS 
by study day 7. Secondary measures included ventilator-free days, hospital and intensive care unit 
length of stay, 28-day and 1-year survival, and change in serum biomarkers associated with 
ARDS. A final α level of .0737 (α = .10 overall) was required for statistical significance of the 
primary outcome.
RESULTS—Among 390 analyzed patients (median age, 57 years; 187 [48%] women), median 
(IQR) hospital length of stay was 6 (3–10) days. Administration of aspirin, compared with 
placebo, did not significantly reduce the incidence of ARDS at 7 days (OR, 1.24; 92.6%CI, 0.67–
2.31). No significant differences were seen in secondary outcomes or adverse events.

CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE—Among at-risk patients presenting to the ED, the use of 
aspirin compared with placebo did not reduce the risk of ARDS at 7 days. The findings of this 
phase 2b trial do not support continuation to a larger phase 3 trial.
A cute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) remains a life-threatening critical care 
syndrome1–3 characterized by alveolar-capillary membrane injury and hypoxemic 
respiratory failure. The median time to onset of ARDS is 2 days after hospital presentation.4 
The period between hospital presentation and development of ARDS presents a brief 
window of opportunity for ARDS prevention. Therefore, a major inherent challenge for 
ARDS prevention trials is early and accurate identification and treatment of patients at risk.
Mechanistically, ARDS has been viewed as an inflammatory condition. Recently, additional 
pathways have been described with accumulating evidence suggesting an important role for 
platelets in both the onset5–7 and resolution8–10 of lung injury. Observational studies have

 suggested a potential preventive role for anti platelet therapy in patients at high risk for 
ARDS.11–14 To further understand the role of aspirin for the prevention of ARDS, a 
randomized clinical trial was performed aiming to test the efficacy and safety of aspirin for 
the prevention of ARDS among at-risk patients: the Lung Injury Prevention Study with 
Aspirin (LIPS-A).
Methods
Study Design
This was a multi center, double-blind, placebo-controlled, parallel-group, phase 2b, 
randomized clinical trial. The full study design and study procedures are published 
elsewhere15 and are included in Supplement 1. The study was approved by the institutional 
review boards of all participating locations prior to the initiation of study-related activities. 
Written informed consent was obtained from the patient, next of kin, or the legal 
representative of the patient for those unable to provide consent due to their medical 
condition(s). The patient or surrogate was informed about the right to withdraw from the 
study at any point. Patients who were unable to provide consent prior to randomization due 
to their medical condition(s) were informed accordingly if they regained consciousness.
Study Population
Patients aged 18 years or older admitted to the hospital through the emergency department 
with elevated risk for developing ARDS based on a calculated lung injury prediction score 
(LIPS ≥4)4 were considered for inclusion in the trial. The LIPS threshold of 4 was 
previously identified as the cut point that optimized both sensitivity and specificity of the 
predictive model. The aim of this trial was to better define the role of aspirin as a potential 
ARDS prevention intervention (as opposed to a therapy for established ARDS). Therefore, 
patients with prevalent ARDS at the time of screening were excluded. Patients presenting to 
the emergency department who were already receiving antiplatelet therapies were also 
excluded. Considerations related to this exclusion included the ethical implications of 
discontinuing antiplatelet therapies in patients for whom they had previously been 
prescribed as well as the potential confounding effects of preadmission antiplatelet therapies 
(and their potential for extended impact on platelet function even after discontinuation) with 
the primary outcome of interest. Additional exclusion criteria are described in Supplement 1. 
Shortly after trial onset, the data and safety monitoring board removed prevalent chronic 
kidney disease or acute kidney injury as exclusion criteria. Randomization was required to 
be completed within 12 hours of presentation to the participating hospital. Information on 
race, stipulated by the study funding agency, was collected from participants via self-report.
Randomization and Blinding
Eligible participants were centrally randomized in a 1:1 ratio to the aspirin or placebo 
treatment group using Medidata Balance. Dynamic minimization with a second guess 
probability of 0.2 was used to randomly allocate treatment assignments while stratifying by 
center.16 The study participant, clinical team, and all members of the study team were 
blinded to treatment allocation.

 Interventions
Study Drug—The first dose of study drug was administered within 24 hours after 
presentation to the hospital. For patients randomized to the intervention group, a 325-mg 
loading dose of aspirin was administered on day 1, followed by 81mg of aspirin once daily 
up to day 7, hospital discharge, or death, whichever occurred first. The placebo group 
received an identical-appearing capsule filled with lactose powder. The dose of aspirin 
selected for this trial was influenced by existing literature noting low-dose aspirin at 81mg/d 
was effective in elevating plasma levels of anti-inflammatory lipoxins and inhibiting platelet 
thromboxane activity with only a slight increase in effect at higher doses.17,18 A larger 
loading dose of aspirin (325 mg) was selected in an effort to mitigate potential risks related 
to insufficient dosing of study medication.
Co-Interventions—Important co-interventions, including mechanical ventilation, 
aspiration precautions, infection control, and fluid and transfusion management, were 
standardized across sites using the web-based tool Checklist for Lung Injury Prevention 
(CLIP)19 (see full protocol in Supplement 1).
Outcomes
The primary outcome was the development of ARDS, as defined by Berlin criteria (modified 
to require invasive mechanical ventilation),20 within 7 days of hospital admission. The 
inclusion of invasive mechanical ventilation as a requirement for adjudicating ARDS was 
pursued to mitigate concerns related to the more subjective nature of implementing 
noninvasive ventilator support. In addition, restriction of mechanical ventilator support to 
include only invasive mechanical ventilation provided a greater degree of consistency with 
prior ARDS clinical trials. To assess for the primary outcome, study participants were 
screened daily for receipt of mechanical ventilation and determination of the partial pressure 
of arterial oxygen (Pao2) or oxygen saturation to fraction of inspired oxygen ratio 
(Spo2:Fio2). If the study participant’s Spo2:Fio2 ratio was consistently below 315,21 
hypoxemia was confirmed with measurement of arterial blood gas. Chest radiographs for all 
intubated patients with a Pao2:Fio2 ratio of 300 or less were independently reviewed by both 
site investigator and a member of the trial’s executive committee (D.T.) for bilateral 
infiltrates consistent with ARDS. Disagreements were resolved by 3 additional investigators 
blinded to the initial ARDS adjudication (D.J.K., O.G., M.N.G.). Study participants who 
died or were discharged from the hospital before day 7without meeting criteria for ARDS 
were adjudicated as not having ARDS. Secondary outcome assessments included ventilator-
free days to hospital day 28, intensive care unit (ICU) and hospital lengths of stay, and 28-
day and 1-year mortality.
Biomarker Analysis
Plasma samples were obtained at baseline (after randomization, before administration of 
study drug), on study day 1 (approximately 24 hours after the first dose), and on study day 4 
for enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays (in duplicate) of 9 plasma biomarkers previously 
found to be associated with the development of ARDS. These include surfactant protein D 
(SP-D), a marker of lung epithelial injury (Bio Vendor Inc); angiopoietin 2 (Ang-2), a

 marker and mediator of endothelial injury (R&D Systems); interleukins IL-1β, IL-2, IL-4, 
IL-6, IL-8, and IL-10; and tumor necrosis factor α (TNF-α), markers of inflammation 
(Meso Scale Diagnostics).
Statistical Methods
This study was designed as a phase 2b clinical trial using an a priori α= .10 and planned 
interim analysis, which was conducted with an information fraction of 62.5% (n = 250 
participants). This shifted the final α level from a planned .0889 to .0737 using the 
prespecified O’Brien-Fleming–like α spending function.22,23 Therefore, for the primary end 
point to be statistically significant, the 2-sided P value would need to be <.0737. For 
secondary end points, P <. 10 was considered statistically significant. No adjustment for 
multiple testing was applied to reported P values, and these analyses should be interpreted as 
exploratory.
We estimated the sample size of 197 per group based on the following assumptions: (1) an 
ARDS development rate of 18%, (2) a minimum clinically relevant effect of 10 percentage 
points, and (3) a final 2-sided α of .0889, adjusted for a planned interim analysis at 50% 
information fraction. The effect size of 10% was chosen by the study’s executive team at the 
time of protocol creation based on the impression that this represents a clinically relevant 
between-group difference in ARDS event rates. Conservative sample size estimates were 
based on ARDS event rates of 25%and 15%to decrease the relative risk and increase the 
binomial proportion variance. Target randomization was set at 200 participants per group 
(400 total) to allow for attrition.
Conditional logistic regression was used to test the primary hypothesis that early aspirin 
administration would decrease the rate of ARDS. Clinical site was included in the model as 
a stratification variable. This analysis was supplemented by Cochran-Mantel-Haenszel 
stratified analysis with odds ratios computed for each site. We used the Breslow-Day test to 
test for differences in aspirin effect by site. Secondary binary end points were tested using 
unconditional tests and time-to-event analyses were conducted using Kaplan-Meier 
estimator. Continuous measures were tested between groups using Wilcoxon rank sum and 
2-sample t tests. Numerical summaries of these variables are presented as median (quartile 
1-quartile 3) and mean (SD) unless otherwise specified. The protocol-specified full 
intention-to-treat (ITT) analysis set was modified to account for withdrawal of consent or 
ineligibility based on inclusion or exclusion criteria. We conducted analyses on the resultant 
full analysis set (ie, a modified ITT analysis set). Plasma biomarkers were analyzed 
separately using mixed models to test for the fixed effects of day of treatment, treatment 
assignment, and the treatment by time. Participants were modeled with a random intercept. 
Biomarker concentrations were log transformed prior to analysis, and for concentrations 
below the assay lower limit of detection (LLD), a numeric value was imputed as 0.5 × assay 
LLD.
In addition to statistical criteria for significance, the study included a priori “go-no-go” 
definitions for recommending continuation to phase 3 study (see section 10.3.5 in the 
protocol in Supplement 1). Briefly, continuation to phase 3 would occur with a positive 
primary outcome finding along with an acceptable safety profile. An acceptable safety

 profile was defined as a serious adverse event profile for aspirin that was not statistically 
worse than placebo (95% CI for the relative risk of any serious adverse event covers the null 
value of relative risk = 1.0). The “no-go decision” was defined as early termination by the 
data and safety monitoring board for safety or unfavorable risk/benefit ratio. An 
indeterminate case in which there was a non–statistically significant effect but this effect was 
in a clinically meaningful direction was also defined. Final statistical analyses were 
conducted using the base SAS System version 9.4 and SAS/STAT version 14.1.
Results
Patient Characteristics
Between January 2, 2012, and November 17, 2014, 7673 patients were screened at 16 
medical centers from across the United States (Figure; eTable 1 in Supplement 2). The most 
common reasons for exclusion included antiplatelet therapy at the time of presentation (n = 
3052), inability to obtain informed consent within the prespecified 12-hour window (n = 
1299), and suspicion for active bleeding at time of initial evaluation (n = 999). After 
excluding 7273 screen failures, 400 patients were randomized. Ten randomized patients 
were excluded from subsequent analyses (aspirin, n = 7; placebo, n = 3; 6 for withdrawal of 
consent and 4 for ineligibility discovered after randomization), leaving 195 patients in each 
group of the modified ITT analysis set.
Baseline demographics and clinical characteristics, according to treatment allocation, are 
presented in Table 1. Randomization procedures were effective at equalizing distributions of 
baseline variables. The median (interquartile range [IQR]) time from hospital presentation to 
randomization was 7.3 (5.1–10.2) hours. The median age was 57 (45–68) years and 52% 
(203/390) were male. Baseline lung injury prediction scores (LIPS) were not significantly 
different between groups, with a median (IQR) LIPS of 6.0 (5.0–7.5) in the aspirin group 
and 5.5 (4.5–7.0) in the placebo group. Major risk factors for ARDS were similarly 
distributed in both treatment groups.
Study Drug Administration
Of 2049 potential study drug administration episodes,1742 (85%) were provided as per 
protocol. Of the 195 patients randomized to receive aspirin, 185 (95%) received at least 1 
dose of study medication. In the placebo group, 189(96.9%) received at least 1 dose of study 
drug. The median (IQR) number of doses was not statistically different (4 [2–7] for aspirin 
and 5 [3–7] for placebo; P = .19). The median time from randomization to first study drug 
administration was 12.7 (7.9–21.2) hours in the aspirin group and 12.4 (8.8–19.3) hours in 
the placebo group (P = .86). Reasons for study participants not receiving at least 1of their 
assigned study medications are provided in the Figure1.
Primary Outcomes
In the modified ITT analysis set, 37 patients (9.5%) developed ARDS within 7 days of 
randomization: 20 patients (10.3%) in the aspirin group compared with 17 patients in the 
placebo group (8.7%), for a site-adjusted odds ratio (92.6% CI) of 1.24 (0.67–2.31);P = .53. 
The distribution of ARDS by enrolling site is shown in the online data supplement (eFigure

 1 in Supplement 2). The Breslow-Day test for homogeneity did not suggest there was 
significant variation in the odds ratio by site (P = .19).
Secondary Outcomes
There was no signal for a beneficial effect of aspirin across secondary efficacy outcome 
measures (Table 2). A total of 18 patients (9.2%) in the aspirin group and 18 patients (9.2%) 
in the placebo group died by 28 days (28-day survival, 90% vs 90%, hazard ratio [90% CI], 
1.03 [0.60–1.79]; log-rank P = .92). Longer-term mortality over the year of follow-up 
showed the same pattern as shorter-duration mortality analyses (1-year survival, 73% vs 
75%; hazard ratio [90% CI], 1.06 [0.75–1.50]; log rank P = .79; eFigure 2 in Supplement 2). 
No statistically significant differences were noted in the additional secondary clinical 
outcomes including need for mechanical ventilation, ventilator-free days at day 28, ICU 
length of stay, or hospital length of stay. Patients in the aspirin group were more likely to be 
admitted to the ICU (59.0% vs 50.3%; odds ratio [90% CI], 1.42 [1.02–1.99]; P = .08). In 
the biomarker analysis, IL-2 was higher in the aspirin group vs placebo on day 1 (P = .08) 
with a time × treatment interaction effect (P = .08) that met the prespecified level of 
significance (P < .10). However, there were no other between-group differences or time × 
treatment interaction effects for any of the other biomarker levels analyzed at baseline, day 
1, or day 4 (P > .10) (eFigure 3 in Supplement 2).
Adverse Events
No statistically significant differences were found in measures of safety (Table 3; eTable 2 in 
Supplement 2). Study-reported adverse events were observed in 7.7% (30/390) of the 
participants. Of these, bleeding-related adverse events were reported in 11 of 195 patients 
(5.6%) assigned to the aspirin group and 5 of 195 patients (2.6%) assigned to the placebo 
group (odds ratio [90% CI], 2.27 [0.92–5.61]; P = .13). Moderate or severe bleeding-related 
adverse events were infrequent in both groups [aspirin (n = 8) vs placebo (n = 4), 4.1% vs 
2.1%, odds ratio [90% CI], 2.04 [0.74–5.67]; P = .24). Development of worsening renal 
function as estimated by the modified RIFLE criteria (Risk, Injury, Failure, Loss, End-stage 
Renal Disease24) did not differ statistically by treatment assignment. Detailed numerical 
summaries of changes in renal function are included in Table 3.
Discussion
We report the results of a multicenter, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled phase 
2b trial evaluating early aspirin administration for prevention of ARDS. In at-risk patients, 
initiating aspirin therapy within 24 hours of presentation to the emergency department was 
safe when compared with placebo. However, early aspirin therapy did not decrease the 
primary outcome of ARDS development or improve any of the secondary outcomes. As 
such, the results of this phase 2b trial did not meet the prespecified criteria to recommend 
pursuing a larger, phase 3 study.
Despite substantial improvements over the past 2 decades,1,25 mortality in severe ARDS 
remains as high as 40% to 50%.3,20 The search for further reductions in mortality has shifted 
attention from targeted therapeutics administered after the development of critical illness to

 earlier interventions designed to ameliorate or even prevent organ failure.26,27 The majority 
of patients and clinicians are willing to consider an acceptably safe, early intervention before 
the development of disease in order to prevent later, more severe consequences. In this 
paradigm, timely risk stratification is essential to maximize administration to patients who 
have the highest probability of benefit and to minimize the risk to patients who will never go 
on to develop the disease.
The time course of ARDS development following presentation to the emergency department 
is rapid, with most cases developing within 1 to 2 days of initial hospitalization.4,28 To 
effectively test a true prevention strategy, we based patient identification and risk 
stratification on early determination of LIPS of4or higher in the emergency department or 
ICU coupled with a 12-hour trial eligibility window, well in advance of the usual time frame 
for enrolling participants in ARDS treatment trials.
Early aspirin administration for ARDS prevention was tested based on the body of existing 
experimental data demonstrating alterations in platelet function during the development of 
ARDS.29 Platelet activation, aggregation, and sequestration, as well as modulation of anti-
inflammatory lipid mediators, including leukotrienes, thromboxane, and prostaglandins, 
have all been implicated as important mediators of ARDS progression and severity.5,6,8,9,29 
Aspirin directly modifies these mechanistic pathways, making it a plausible preventive and 
therapeutic measure in this setting.5,30,31 To date, clinical studies have suggested conflicting 
benefits of aspirin or other nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs in the setting of both sepsis 
and lung injury.11–14,32 In this first randomized clinical trial evaluating aspirin for the 
prevention of ARDS, no effects on the primary or secondary clinical outcomes were noted. 
Increased IL-2 concentrations after treatment with aspirin were present on day 1, consistent 
with prior work suggesting increased IL-2 production following aspirin administration.33 
These results may signify a biological effect of aspirin. However, type I error cannot be 
excluded and any potential biological effect of aspirin was not associated with a difference 
in clinical outcomes nor alterations in the other 8 plasma biomarkers of inflammation, 
endothelial injury, and lung epithelial injury.
In trials of early aspirin administration for acute coronary syndrome and stroke, the excess 
risk of major extracranial bleeding has been estimated as a proportional increase of 
approximately half of the baseline absolute risk of bleeding, a risk offset by the much greater 
absolute benefits of treatment.34 We observed similar risks for moderate or severe bleeding 
events; however, the results of the investigation failed to associate aspirin administration 
with any benefits of reduced rate of ARDS, intensity of hospital use, or mortality.
In addition to testing the specific hypotheses of this trial, we gleaned potentially useful 
additional information during this investigation. The study demonstrated that the conduct of 
a large multicenter ARDS prevention trial, though challenging, was feasible. Unlike most 
ARDS treatment trials in which the primary screening and enrollment activity occurs in the 
ICU, the primary screening environment for this investigation was the emergency 
department. Furthermore, the window for randomization was limited (12 hours from 
presentation). These constraints required meaningful modifications to the traditional 
screening and recruitment strategies used in prior ARDS treatment trials. Computer-assisted

 high-throughput screening algorithms greatly facilitated study activities at participating 
centers where they could be implemented. Modifications in study coordinator screening 
times (extending screening activities through the evenings to better capture the presentation 
times of the target population) also facilitated the identification of study participants.
Strengths of this investigation include the robust study design, secondary review of ARDS 
outcomes by an independent review panel, implementation of the LIPS risk prediction score 
to enrich the study population, and use of the CLIP19 to assist with standardizing important 
co-interventions that may have otherwise confounded the interactions of interest.
There were also several limitations that deserve discussion. First and foremost was the lower 
than expected rate of ARDS development (9.5%vs 18%expected). Although the reasons for 
this unexpectedly low rate of ARDS remain unclear, considerations include suboptimal 
performance of the LIP score, biased enrollment as a result of the informed consent process 
(less severely ill patients being more likely to provide consent), effectiveness of adherence 
with CLIP elements in reducing the risk of hospital-acquired ARDS, or temporal reductions 
in the rate of ARDS from the time of study planning to actual study conduct. In addition to 
the lower than expected rate of ARDS, low rates of mechanical ventilation, acute kidney 
injury, and mortality suggest that the enrolled study population may have had a more modest 
overall severity of illness than what was anticipated at study onset. As a result, the external 
validity of our findings in a cohort of critically ill patients with greater severity of illness 
remains unclear. Still, the results of this trial appear robust and consistent between the 
clinical and biomarker outcome measures.
Second, despite the intention of early identification of patients at risk for ARDS to facilitate 
the testing of aspirin as a prevention intervention, a large number of potential study 
participants (n = 1152) had bilateral infiltrates consistent with ARDS at the time of 
screening. This limitation highlights the challenge of pursuing ARDS prevention strategies 
even when targeting screening efforts to environments such as the emergency department. 
Also noted is the larger than expected number of patients who were excluded for prevalent 
antiplatelet therapy or who were thought to be at high risk for bleeding. In addition to 
potentially biasing the study population toward a less severely ill cohort, thereby 
contributing to the lower than expected rate of ARDS, these exclusions may further limit the 
generalizability of the study findings.
Third, the time from randomization to first drug administration was longer than anticipated 
at study onset. The goal was to encourage informed consent, randomization, and first study 
medication administration to be as accelerated as ethically possible. Delays were 
occasionally experienced due to the need for legally authorized representative consent as 
well as the lack of a 24-hour research pharmacy at many of the participating institutions.
Fourth, it is also possible the aspirin dose chosen for this study was too low. Although prior 
studies informed the dosing regimen used in this trial,17,18 larger doses of aspirin or 
extended duration of administration may have resulted in different outcomes. Additional 
mechanistic studies on the effect of aspirin on thromboxane and platelet-neutrophil function 
are in progress to better address this question.

 Conclusions
Among at-risk patients presenting to the emergency department, the use of aspirin compared 
with placebo did not reduce the risk of ARDS at 7 days. The findings of this phase 2b trial 
do not support continuation to a larger phase 3 trial.

 Figure . Flowchart of Enrolled Participants and Progress Through the LIPS-A Trial
Reasons for exclusion were not mutually exclusive and exhaustive because participants 
could have more than 1 reason for exclusion. Exclusion after randomization (n = 10) 
resulted in a change from an intention-to-treat analysis to a modified intention-to-treat 
analysis denoted as the full analysis set in International Conference on Harmonization 
statistical guidelines (E9 guidelines). The full analysis set was used for all analyses. The 
ineligibility reasons for the 4 participants withdrawn from the intention-to-treat sample were 
allergy to aspirin confirmed before first dose but after randomization; non-English speaking 
and removed per institutional review board determination; participant enrolled into study 
twice (second enrollment excluded); and patient was determined to have acute kidney injury 
after consent but prior to first dose. The 6 participants who withdrew consent indicated that 
previously collected data could not be used in the study.
