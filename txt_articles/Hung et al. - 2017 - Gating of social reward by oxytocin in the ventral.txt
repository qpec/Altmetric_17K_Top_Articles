The reward generated by social interactions is critical for promoting prosocial behaviors.
Here we present evidence that oxytocin (OXT) release in the ventral tegmental area (VTA), a
key node of the brain’s reward circuitry, is necessary to elicit social reward. During social
interactions, activity in paraventricular nucleus (PVN) OXTneurons increased. Direct
activation of these neurons in the PVN or their terminals in the VTA enhanced prosocial
behaviors. Conversely, inhibition of PVN OXTaxon terminals in the VTA decreased social
interactions.OXT increased excitatory drive onto reward-specificVTA dopamine (DA) neurons.
These results demonstrate that OXTpromotes prosocial behavior through direct effects on
VTA DA neurons, thus providing mechanistic insight into how social interactions can generate
rewarding experiences.
P
ositive prosocial experiences are criti-
cal for cooperative and productive in-
teractions between members of a group.
Conversely, the inability to experience
reinforcement from social interactions
(henceforth, “social reward”) is a symptom of
neuropsychiatric disorders, notably autism (1).
Over the past decade, evidence has accumu-
lated that the neuropeptide oxytocin (OXT) plays
a critical role in social behaviors and may have
therapeutic utility for the treatment of social
behavior deficits (2). An important clue that
OXT exerts some of its actions by influencing
the brain’s reward circuitry came from work
demonstrating that OXT receptors (OXTrs) in
the nucleus accumbens (NAc) of prairie voles
were critical for pair bonding (3). Subsequent
work suggested that OXT action in the NAc is
also important for social reward in mice (4).
OXT action in the ventral tegmental area (VTA),
another key node of reward circuitry, may also be
critical for regulating social interaction cues (5, 6)
and social reward (7). Although social interactions
in mice are accompanied by increases in activity
in NAc-projecting VTA dopamine (DA) neurons
(8), which are critical for motivated behaviors (9),
the mechanism by which VTA DA neuron activ-
ity is gated during social behaviors is unknown.
Rabies virus–based tracing methods have sug-
gested that OXT neurons in the paraventricular
nucleus (PVN) send axonal projections to the
VTA (10). To visualize these OXTergic projec-
tions directly, we injected AAVDJ-DIO-eGFP
(adeno-associated virus DJ with double-floxed
inverse open reading frame flanking enhanced
green fluorescent protein) into the PVN of a
knock-in mouse line expressing Cre recombinase
in OXT neurons (OXTiresCre) (Fig. 1A). Consistent
with previous reports (11), we found colocaliza-
tion of eGFP and OXT immunostaining in the
PVN, with no detectable eGFP expression in
vasopressin (AVP) PVN neurons (~48% of OXT
neurons expressed eGFP in tissue sections from
eight animals) (Fig. 1B). Axons expressing eGFP
were present in the VTA (Fig. 1B), often in close
proximity to OXTr-expressing DA neurons (Fig. 1C),
which were localized using an OXTr-Venus
knock-in mouse line (12). Tail-vein fluorogold
injections revealed that both magnocellular and
parvocellular PVN OXT neurons projected to the
VTA (fig. S1).
To investigate whether PVN neurons project-
ing to the VTA are necessary for social reward,
we inhibited these neurons by injecting a ret-
rogradely transported canine adenovirus express-
ing Cre (CAV2-Cre) into the VTA and an AAV
expressing a Cre-dependent inward rectifying
potassium channel (AAVDJ-DIO-Kir2.1-ZsGreen)
into the PVN (Fig. 1D and fig. S2A). Two weeks
after viral injections, mice were subjected to a
social conditioned place preference (CPP) as-
say (4). Mice expressing the potassium channel
(Kir2.1) in VTA-projecting PVN neurons exhib-
ited reduced preference for the socially condi-
tioned context (Fig. 1, F and G) compared with
control mice expressing ZsGreen (Fig. 1, E and
G). Expression of Kir2.1 in VTA-projecting PVN
neurons did not influence the CPP generated by
administration of cocaine (fig. S2, B to D) or
locomotor activity (fig. S2E).
To test whether OXT action in the VTA is
necessary for social reward, we selectively ab-
lated OXTrs in the VTA by injecting an AAVDJ-
Cre-eGFP into the VTA of floxed OXTr (OXTr fl/f l)
mice (Fig. 1H) (13). Unlike wild-type mice injected
with the same virus, mice lacking OXTrs in the
VTA exhibited no social CPP (Fig. 1, I to K). To
determine whether OXTrs specifically in DA
neurons are necessary for social reward, we
crossed OXTr fl/fl mice with DATCre mice (14)
(Fig. 1L; fig. S3 illustrates the breeding strategy).
Homozygous OXTr DA knockout (KO) mice
exhibited no social CPP, whereas littermate
control mice expressed normal social CPP, as did
heterozygous OXTr DA KO mice (Fig. 1, M to O,
and fig. S4, A to C). Deleting OXTrs from sub-
populations of GABAergic cells by crossing OXTr fl/fl
mice with GAD2Cre mice (Fig. 1P) had no effect
on social CPP (Fig. 1, Q to S). All of these mouse
lines exhibited CPP in response to cocaine and
normal locomotor activity in the open field after
saline and cocaine injections (fig. S4, D to K).
Todeterminewhetheractivity in VTA-projecting
PVN neurons increases during social interac-
tions, we injected CAV2-Cre into the VTA of Ai14
tdTomato reporter mice to label cells project-
ing to the VTA (Fig. 2A) and assessed the ex-
pression of the immediate early gene c-fos (15).
After social interaction, the proportion of VTA-
projecting PVN neurons expressing c-fos tri-
pled compared with that in mice that interacted
with a toy mouse (Fig. 2B). To more directly
measure PVN OXT neuronal activity during so-
cial interactions, we targeted the fluorescent cal-
cium indicator GCaMP6m to PVN OXT neurons
by injecting AAVDJ-DIO-GCaMP6m into the PVN
of OXTiresCre mice and performed fiber photo-
metry (Fig. 2, C to E). No increase in fluorescent
signal occurred when these mice interacted with
a toy mouse (Fig. 2F). However, there was a time-
lockedincrease inthe activityofPVNOXTneurons
duringsocialcontactwithajuvenile(Fig.2,GandH).
We next investigated whether optogenetic ac-
tivation of PVN OXT neurons alone is reward-
ing by injecting a Cre-dependent AAV expressing
ChETA (AAVDJ-DIO-ChETA-eYFP) into the PVN of
OXTiresCre mice and implanting optical fibers in
the PVN (ChETA, channelrhodopsin-2 with threo-
nine substituted for glutamic acid at position 123;
eYFP, enhanced yellow fluorescent protein) (Fig. 2,
I and J). OXTiresCre mice injected with AAVDJ-
DIO-eYFP served as controls. Consistent with pre-
vious results (16), optogenetic activation of PVN
OXT neurons did not reinforce operant behaviors,
as assayed using real-time CPP (RT-CPP) (Fig. 2K
and fig. S5, A and B) and nose-poking for intra-
cranial self-stimulation (ICSS) (Fig. 2L and fig.
S5, C to G).
Because PVN OXT neuron activity appears
to be important for social reward, yet their
activation alone did not drive instrumental
learning, we hypothesized that activation of
these neurons in a social context would facil-
itate this type of learning. In a social RT-CPP
(sRT-CPP) protocol, mice were exposed to a con-
fined novel juvenile mouse on day 1 without
any stimulation (Fig. 2M). On day 2, optogenetic
stimulation occurred when mice entered the
compartment containing the confined familiar

 juvenile. In OXTiresCre mice expressing eYFP
in PVN OXT neurons, photostimulation did not
cause an increase in preference for the social
context on day 2, whereas the same photostim-
ulation in mice expressing ChETA elicited a
clear increase in preference for the social context
(Fig. 2, N to P, and fig. S5, H to J). Locomotion
during these assays was not affected (fig. S5K).
OXT has been implicated in social memory
and learning, and because mice prefer inter-
acting with a novel conspecific over a familiar
one (17), it is possible that PVN OXT neuron ac-
tivation interfered with the memory of the day
1 interaction, thus making the familiar juvenile
mouse appear novel on day 2. We therefore per-
formed a three-chamber sociability task during
which photostimulation of PVN OXT neurons
was applied continuously while mice could free-
ly explore compartments with an empty vessel
or a vessel containing a novel juvenile (fig. S6, A
to C). Immediately after this session, a novel
juvenile was placed in the previously empty vessel
(fig. S6D). Mice expressing ChETA in PVN OXT
neurons explored the compartment containing
the novel juvenile in a similar manner to that of con-
trol mice expressing eYFP; both sets of mice spent
more time exploring the novel juvenile (fig. S6E).
To test whether stimulating OXT release speci-
fically in the VTA could replicate the behavioral
results of PVN OXT neuron soma stimulation,
we expressed ChETA or eYFP in PVN OXT neu-
rons in OXTiresCre mice and implanted optical
fibers in the VTA (Fig. 3A and fig. S7, A and B).

 Stimulation of PVN OXT neuron axons in the
VTA replicated all of the results generated by
soma stimulation. Neither RT-CPP nor ICSS was
elicited (fig. S7, C to H); however, clear sRT-CPP
was elicited in ChETA-expressing mice but not in
control eYFP-expressing mice (Fig. 3, B and C,
and fig. S7, I and J). Administration of an OXTr
antagonist (L-368,899 HCl; 5 mg per kilogram of
body weight, injected intraperitoneally) prevented
the sRT-CPP elicited by stimulation of PVN OXT
neuron terminals in the VTA (Fig. 3, D and E, and
fig. S7, K and L) but had no detectable effects on
its own (fig. S7M).
To further explore whether activating PVN
OXT neuron axons in the VTA enhances socia-
bility, we performed a juvenile interaction as-
say using different photostimulation protocols
(fig. S8A). Photostimulation only when mice were
in social contact (proximity <2 cm) over 3 days
caused an increase in the time spent interacting,
compared with that observed for eYFP-expressing
control mice receiving the same stimulation
(Fig. 3, F and G). In contrast, photostimulation
throughout the duration of the experiment had
no effect (Fig. 3, H and I). Furthermore, applying
the same protocols but with a toy mouse had
no effect on toy mouse interaction times (fig.
S8, B to F).
These experiments provide evidence that ac-
tivation of PVN OXT neuron axons in the VTA
promotes sociability but do not prove that OXT
release in the VTA normally contributes to such
behaviors. We therefore repeated our assays in
OXTiresCre mice expressing the inhibitory opsin
NpHR3.0 in a Cre-dependent manner (AAVDJ-
DIO-NpHR3.0-eYFP) in the PVN, with optical
fibers implanted in the VTA (Fig. 3J). Inhibiting
PVN OXT neuron projections in the VTA re-
duced the preference for the social context (Fig. 3,

 K to N), whereas the same stimulation did not
have effects during standard RT-CPP assays
(fig. S9, A and B). Similarly, inhibiting PVN OXT
projections in the VTA through NpHR3.0 activation
reduced the time spent interacting with a novel
juvenile over the course of 3 days when applied
in a context-dependent manner (Fig. 3, O and P)
but not when stimulation was applied continu-
ously during the experiment (Fig. 3, Q and R).
A simple hypothesis to explain the behavioral
results is that OXT release in the VTA occurs
early in the time course of a social interaction
and enhances the excitability of DA neurons pro-
jecting to the NAc. This increases DA release in
the NAc, which reinforces the social interaction.
We crossed DATCre mice with Ai14 mice to label
DA cells with tdTomato, injected fluorescent ret-
robeads into the NAc medial shell (NacMedS),
and made recordings from NAcMedS-projecting
VTA DA neurons (Fig. 4, A and B), activity in
which increases during social interactions (8).
In cell-attached current clamp recordings, appli-
cation of the OXTr agonist [Thr4,Gly7]-oxytocin
(TGOT; 1 mM) increased spontaneous spiking in
DA neurons, an effect reversed by application of
the OXTr antagonist L-368,899 HCl (1 mM; Fig. 4,
C and D). DA cells that did not contain retrobeads
and presumably do not project to the NAcMedS
did not exhibit a change in spiking in response to
TGOT (Fig. 4, C and D).
The number of spikes elicited by depolarizing
current pulses in NAcMedS-projecting DA neu-
rons did not change during TGOT application (fig.
S10, A and B), nor did the cells’ resting membrane
potential and input resistance (fig. S10, C and D).
However, TGOT increased evoked excitatory post-
synaptic current (EPSC) amplitude when DA cells
were voltage-clamped at –60 mV and simulta-
neously decreased evoked inhibitory postsynaptic

 current (IPSC) amplitude when the same cells
were voltage-clamped at 0 mV (Fig. 4, E and F).
These synaptic effects of TGOT were reversed by
application of the OXTr antagonist (Fig. 4, E and
F). The decrease in IPSC amplitude was asso-
ciated with an increase in the IPSC paired pulse
ratio (PPR), whereas EPSC PPRs were not affected
by TGOT (Fig. 4G), suggesting that OXT acts
presynaptically at inhibitory synapses and post-
synaptically at excitatory synapses. Consistent
with these sites of OXT action in the VTA, when
recordings were made from NAcMedS-projecting
DA neurons lacking OXTrs (i.e., in slices from the
cross of OXTr fl/fl and Ai14:DATcre mice), TGOT
caused no changes in EPSCs but evoked a de-
crease in IPSC amplitude and an increase in IPSC
PPRs (Fig. 4, H to J). These results from acute
slices are consistent with in vivo studies demon-
strating that optogenetic stimulation of PVN OXT
neurons increased the proportion of c-fos–positive
VTA DA neurons in the anatomical regions where
NAcMedS-projecting DA neurons are located (fig.
S11, A to D).
We have provided evidence that OXT release
in the VTA enhances the activity of a specific
population of DA neurons that influence social
interactions (8). Several results indicate that this
action of OXT is important for the reinforcing
component of social interactions. First, inhibition
of OXT action in the VTA—by inhibiting the
activity of VTA-projecting PVN neurons or genet-
ically deleting OXTrs from VTA DA neurons—
prevented social CPP. Second, the activity of PVN
OXT neurons increased during social interac-
tions. Third, optogenetic activation of PVN OXT
neuron inputs in the VTA enhanced sociability,
but only when activation of OXT axons occurred
approximately during social interactions. Fourth,
optogenetic inhibition of the OXT inputs in the
VTA reduced sociability.
OXT is important for a range of behaviors in
rodents owing to its specific actions in a variety
of brain structures (18–22), including the VTA (7).
Our results provide mechanistic insights into how
OXT can modulate activity in the VTA, which we
demonstrate is critical for mediating some of
OXT’s effects on sociability. Peripheral OXT ad-
ministration may enhance human VTA blood oxy-
gen level–dependent activity infunctional magnetic
resonance imaging studies (23, 24), suggesting
that our findings have relevance for understand-
ing OXT actions in the human brain. However,
the clinical utility of OXT administration for
treating social deficits in patients with neuro-
psychiatric disorders remains unclear (2), even
though OXT treatment can ameliorate social
behavior deficits in mouse models of autism
